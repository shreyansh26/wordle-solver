First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word in this Wordle-like game. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior feedback, so I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get, regardless of the secret word.

The goal is to cover a variety of common letters and positions to get useful feedback. In Wordle strategy, people often start with words that have common letters and avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities.

Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants include S, T, R, N, L, etc. So, I should pick a word with multiple vowels and frequent consonants.

Standard starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. These are often recommended because they contain a good mix of vowels and consonants.

Let me think about ""CRANE"": it has C, R, A, N, E. That covers three consonants and two vowels. A and E are vowels, C, R, N are consonants. R is sometimes considered a vowel-like sound, but for this, it's fine.

For my first guess, I'll use ""CRANE"" because it's a common choice and gives good coverage.

Now, I need to output it in the specified format. So, my response should be:

<guess> crane </guess>

But before that, I need to include a step-by-step thought process within </think> tags, but since it's the first guess, I don't have any reasoning from feedback yet. The instruction says: ""Think through the problem and feedback step by step."" But for the first guess, there is no feedback.

Looking back at the system prompt:

""Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within </think> and </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word...""

Since this is the first guess, I should think about why I'm choosing this word as my step-by-step process.

So, my thought process:

1. This is the first guess; there's no prior feedback, so I need to choose a word that helps eliminate many possibilities.

2. I should select a word with common letters to increase the chance of getting some in the secret word.

3. ""CRANE"" is a good choice because it has three different vowels (A and E) and common consonants like C, R, N.

4. Also, no repeated letters, so it tests five distinct letters.

5. This will provide feedback on which letters are present and their positions, helping me narrow down for subsequent guesses.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

Finally, output the guess as <guess> crane </guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Thought Process for First Guess:

Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. My goal is to select a starting word that maximizes the information I can gain about the secret word. Here's how I'm reasoning:

1. **Maximize Common Letters**: English 5-letter words often contain vowels like A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like S, T, R, N, L. Choosing a word with multiple vowels and common consonants increases the chances of getting feedback (✓ or -) on several letters.
2. **Avoid Repeating Letters**: To test a wider range of letters, I'll pick a word with five distinct letters. This helps identify which letters are in the secret word more efficiently.
3. **Balanced Coverage**: A good starting word should cover different positions to gather clues about letter placement. Starting with a word like ""CRANE"" (C in position 1, R in 2, A in 3, N in 4, E in 5) is strategic because:
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) in different positions.
   - It uses common consonants (C, R, N) that appear frequently.
   - ""CRANE"" is a valid English word and often recommended for initial guesses in word games.
4. **Information Gain**: After submitting this guess, the feedback will tell me:
   - Which letters are correct (✓), correct but misplaced (-), or absent (x).
   - This data will significantly narrow down possibilities for my next guess.

By starting with ""CRANE"", I lay a strong foundation for subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
N(-) -> N is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter 'N', but not at the position we guessed (which was the 4th letter).
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.

Therefore, we must avoid using C, R, A, E in our next guess. Also, we know that the word has an 'N' but not in the 4th position.

For our next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.
- Contains the letter 'N' (but not in the 4th position).
- We might also want to include other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of common 5-letter words without C, R, A, E and that have an 'N' not in the 4th position.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word has at least one 'N'. Since 'N' is not in the 4th position, we can try placing it in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's try to come up with a word that has 'N' and uses other common letters. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, etc.

Possible words:
- We could try ""saint"": but note that we have A and we know A is not in the word -> so invalid because A is excluded.
- ""point"": P, O, I, N, T. This word doesn't have any of the excluded letters. And we can put 'N' in the 4th position? Wait, but in the feedback we were told that 'N' is not in the 4th position. So we must avoid putting 'N' in the 4th position. In ""point"", N is in the 4th position -> so we cannot use that because we know N is not in the 4th.

We need a word that has 'N' but not in the 4th. So positions for N: 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's try:
- ""linen"": L, I, N, E, N -> but E is excluded, so no.
- ""minis"": M, I, N, I, S -> but we don't know if E is excluded? Actually, E is excluded, but this word doesn't have E. However, we have two I's and two S? But that's okay. But note: we have N in the 3rd position (which is not 4th) so that's acceptable. But let's check the letters: M, I, N, I, S. None of these are C, R, A, E. So it's valid.

But maybe we can do better? We want to cover more common letters.

Another idea: ""tonic"" -> T, O, N, I, C. But C is excluded -> invalid.

""doing"": D, O, I, N, G -> N is in the 4th position? We must avoid 4th. So no.

""joint"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th -> avoid.

""mount"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th -> avoid.

""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> N is in the 1st position (not 4th) and the letters are N, I, G, H, T. None of these are excluded. So this is a candidate.

""might"": M, I, G, H, T -> but no N? We need to include N because we know the word has an N. So we must have N.

""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> N in 1st and 3rd. The 3rd is not 4th. So that's okay. But we have two N's? That's acceptable. Letters: N, I, N, T, H -> no excluded letters.

But we might get more information by using a word with more new letters.

Another candidate: ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position (not 4th). And letters: S, N, O, W, Y -> all new and not excluded.

But note: we don't know if the word has more than one N? But we only know of one N so far. However, the word might have two N's? We don't know.

Alternatively, ""downs"": D, O, W, N, S -> N is in the 4th position? We must avoid 4th -> so no.

""pints"": P, I, N, T, S -> N in the 3rd -> okay. But we have T and S which are common.

But let's consider: we have only 6 tries. We want to maximize information.

Another idea: ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> N in the 4th -> avoid.

""slung"": S, L, U, N, G -> N in the 4th -> avoid.

""singe"": but E is excluded -> invalid.

""minks"": M, I, N, K, S -> N in the 3rd -> okay. Letters: M, I, N, K, S -> all new and not excluded.

""lynch"": L, Y, N, C, H -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

So let's choose between:
- ""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> positions: N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)
- ""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> positions: N(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), H(5) -> but we have two N's. If the secret word has only one N, then we might get confusing feedback? But it's acceptable.
- ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> positions: S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)
- ""minks"": M, I, N, K, S -> positions: M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5)

We know that the secret word has an N, but not in the 4th position. So in ""minks"", N is in the 3rd (which is allowed) and we are testing positions 1,2,3,4,5 with new letters.

But note: in ""minks"", we are putting N in the 3rd. We don't know if that's correct or not, but we are trying to get more information.

Alternatively, we might avoid putting N in the 3rd if we think it might be in another position? But we have no information about other positions.

I think ""minks"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we are testing N in the 3rd position. Also, we are introducing M, I, K, S (and we already know N is present).

But we also have the option ""snowy"": which has N in the 2nd position. That might be better because we haven't tested the 2nd position with N? Actually, in the first guess we didn't have N in the 2nd because ""crane"" had N in the 4th.

We can choose either. Let me pick ""snowy"" because it has more vowels? Actually, it has O and Y (which is sometimes a vowel). But we don't know if O is in the word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in a different position than we tried in the first guess (which was 4th) and also covers more common consonants.

I think ""minks"" is a good candidate because it has M, I, N, K, S. We are testing five new letters and one known (N). But note: we are using the known N in the 3rd position.

Another candidate: ""bongs"" -> B, O, N, G, S -> but N is in the 3rd? Actually, that's the same as 3rd. And we don't know if O is excluded? But we haven't been told O is excluded. However, we don't have any feedback on O. But wait, we haven't tried O. So it's okay.

But let's stick to words without the excluded letters: C, R, A, E.

I think ""minks"" is a valid and good choice.

But let me check if there's a word that has N in the 1st or 5th? Because we haven't tested those positions for N.

For example, ""nobly"": N, O, B, L, Y -> N in the 1st. Letters: N, O, B, L, Y -> all new. This is a good candidate.

""nymph"": N, Y, M, P, H -> N in the 1st. Also good.

But ""nymph"" might be less common? We want a common word.

""nobly"" is acceptable.

So now we have:
- ""nobly"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), Y(5)
- ""night"": N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)
- ""snowy"": S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)
- ""minks"": M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5)

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test. All these words have 5 new letters (since we only know N is present, but we haven't tested any of these letters).

But note: we are also testing the position of N. We know N is not in the 4th, so we are avoiding that.

I think ""nobly"" is a good choice because it tests N in the 1st position, which we haven't tried. Also, it uses common letters? B, L, Y are common.

Alternatively, ""snowy"" tests N in the 2nd.

But let's consider: we have limited tries. We want to get as much information as possible.

Another idea: we could use a word that has two N's? But we don't know if there are two. But if we use two N's, we can check if there are two. For example, ""ninja"": N, I, N, J, A -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

""ninny"": N, I, N, N, Y -> but we have two N's? And Y. But we don't know about I and Y. However, we have two new letters: I and Y. But we are repeating N. Also, the word ""ninny"" might not be very common.

I think it's better to use a word with one N and four new letters.

I'll go with ""nobly"" because it tests N in the first position and introduces O, B, L, Y.

But wait, we have already excluded A, E, R, C. We are testing O, B, L, Y.

Alternatively, we could use ""snowy"" to test S, O, W, Y and N in the second position.

I think both are acceptable. Let me choose ""snowy"" because it has more vowels? (O and Y). But Y is not always a vowel.

Alternatively, we can choose ""point"" but we cannot because N is in the 4th -> excluded.

I think I'll go with ""snowy"".

But wait, in ""snowy"", we are putting N in the 2nd position. We don't know if that's correct. But that's the point of guessing.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put N in the 3rd or 4th? We have ""snowy"" (N in 2nd) and ""nobly"" (N in 1st) and ""downy"" -> but D, O, W, N, Y -> N in the 4th -> avoid.

""tinny"": T, I, N, N, Y -> N in the 3rd and 4th? We have to avoid 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. So ""tinny"" has N in the 3rd and 4th -> we are putting N in the 4th which we know is wrong -> so it's a waste. We should avoid.

So between ""nobly"" and ""snowy"", I think ""snowy"" is a bit more common? But both are valid.

I'll choose ""snowy"".

But let me check: we are going to guess ""snowy"".

If the secret word has N in the 2nd position, we'll get a check. Otherwise, we might get a dash or nothing.

Also, we are testing S, O, W, Y.

But note: we are not using the fact that we know N is in the word? We are including N, so that's good.

Alternatively, we could avoid putting N in a position we think might be wrong? But we don't have information.

I think it's fine.

So my next guess: ""snowy""

But wait, what if the secret word has two N's? We don't know. But we are only putting one N. That's okay because we are testing one position.

We can also consider ""minks"" again. I think ""minks"" is also good.

But let me see: we have 6 tries. We are on the second guess. We can choose any.

I'll go with ""snowy"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.
- N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position.

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, E.
- Include N, but not in the 4th position (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").
- Test new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, T, O, L, I, etc.).
- Prioritize words with N in a different position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th) to narrow down its location.

After evaluating options:
- ""snowy"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits the criteria: 
  - Contains N in the 2nd position (not 4th).
  - Uses new letters (S, O, W, Y) not ruled out by previous feedback.
  - Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, E).

This guess will help test:
- If N is correctly placed in the 2nd position (✓).
- If S, O, W, or Y are present and in the right positions (✓), wrong positions (-), or absent (x).

R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter 'N', but not at the position we guessed (which was the 4th letter).
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.

Therefore, we must avoid using C, R, A, E in our next guess. Also, we know that the word has an 'N' but not in the 4th position.

So we must avoid putting 'N' in the 4th position. In ""point"", N is in the 4th position -> so we cannot use that because we know N is not in the 4th.

We need a word that has 'N' but not in the 4th. So positions for N: 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's try:
- ""linen"": L, I, N, E, N -> but E is excluded, so no.
- ""minis"": M, I, N, I, S -> but we don't know if E is excluded? Actually, E is excluded, but this word doesn't have E. However, we have two I's and two S? But that's okay. But note: we have N in the 3rd position (which is not 4th) so that's acceptable. But let's check the letters: M, I, N, I, S. None of these are C, R, A, E. So it's valid.

But maybe we can do better? We want to cover more common letters.

Another idea: ""tonic"" -> T, O, N, I, C. But C is excluded -> invalid.

""doing"": D, O, I, N, G -> N is in the 4th position? We must avoid 4th. So no.

""joint"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th -> avoid.

""mount"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th -> avoid.

""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> N is in the 1st position (not 4th) and the letters are N, I, G, H, T. None of these are excluded. So this is a candidate.

""might"": M, I, G, H, T -> but no N? We need to include N because we know the word has an N. So we must have N.

""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> N in 1st and 3rd. The 3rd is not 4th. So that's okay. But we have two N's? That's acceptable. Letters: N, I, N, T, H -> no excluded letters.

But we might get more information by using a word with more new letters.

Another candidate: ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position (not 4th). And letters: S, N, O, W, Y -> all new and not excluded.

But note: we don't know if the word has more than one N? But we only know of one N so far. However, the word might have two N's? We don't know.

Alternatively, ""downs"": D, O, W, N, S -> N is in the 4th position? We must avoid 4th -> so no.

""pints"": P, I, N, T, S -> N in the 3rd -> okay. But we have T and S which are common.

But let's consider: we have only 6 tries. We want to maximize information.

Another idea: ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> N in the 4th -> avoid.

""slung"": S, L, U, N, G -> N in the 4th -> avoid.

""singe"": but E is excluded -> invalid.

""minks"": M, I, N, K, S -> N in the 3rd -> okay. Letters: M, I, N, K, S -> all new and not excluded.

""lynch"": L, Y, N, C, H -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

So let's choose between:
- ""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> positions: N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)
- ""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> positions: N(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), H(5) -> but we have two N's. If the secret word has only one N, then we might get confusing feedback? But it's acceptable.
- ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> positions: S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)
- ""minks"": M, I, N, K, S -> positions: M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5)

We know that the secret word has an N, but not in the 4th position. So in ""minks"", N is in the 3rd (which is allowed) and we are testing positions 1,2,3,4,5 with new letters.

But note: in ""minks"", we are putting N in the 3rd. We don't know if that's correct or not, but we are trying to get more information.

Alternatively, we might avoid putting N in the 3rd if we think it might be in another position? But we have no information about other positions.

I think ""minks"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we are testing N in the 3rd position. Also, we are introducing M, I, K, S (and we already know N is present).

But we also have the option ""snowy"": which has N in the 2nd position. That might be better because we haven't tested the 2nd position with N? Actually, in the first guess we didn't have N in the 2nd because ""crane"" had N in the 4th.

We can choose either. Let me pick ""snowy"" because it has more vowels? Actually, it has O and Y (which is sometimes a vowel). But we don't know if O is in the word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in a different position than we tried in the first guess (which was 4th) and also covers more common consonants.

I think ""minks"" is a good candidate because it has M, I, N, K, S. We are testing five new letters and one known (N). But note: we are using the known N in the 3rd position.

Another candidate: ""bongs"" -> B, O, N, G, S -> but N is in the 3rd? Actually, that's the same as 3rd. And we don't know if O is excluded? But we haven't been told O is excluded. However, we don't have any feedback on O. But wait, we haven't tried O. So it's okay.

But let's stick to words without the excluded letters: C, R, A, E.

I think ""minks"" is a valid and good choice.

But let me check if there's a word that has N in the 1st or 5th? Because we haven't tested those positions for N.

For example, ""nobly"": N, O, B, L, Y -> N in the 1st. Letters: N, O, B, L, Y -> all new. This is a good candidate.

""nymph"": N, Y, M, P, H -> N in the 1st. Also good.

But ""nymph"" might be less common? We want a common word.

""nobly"" is acceptable.

So now we have:
- ""nobly"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), Y(5)
- ""night"": N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)
- ""snowy"": S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)
- ""minks"": M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5)

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test. All these words have 5 new letters (since we only know N is present, but we haven't tested any of these letters).

But note: we are also testing the position of N. We know N is not in the 4th, so we are avoiding that.

I think ""nobly"" is a good choice because it tests N in the 1st position, which we haven't tried. Also, it uses common letters? B, L, Y are common.

Alternatively, ""snowy"" tests N in the 2nd.

But let's consider: we have limited tries. We want to get as much information as possible.

Another idea: we could use a word that has two N's? But we don't know if there are two. But if we use two N's, we can check if there are two. For example, ""ninja"": N, I, N, J, A -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

""ninny"": N, I, N, N, Y -> but we have two N's? And Y. But we don't know about I and Y. However, we have two new letters: I and Y. But we are repeating N. Also, the word ""ninny"" might not be very common.

I think it's better to use a word with one N and four new letters.

I'll go with ""nobly"" because it tests N in the first position and introduces O, B, L, Y.

But wait, we have already excluded A, E, R, C. We are testing O, B, L, Y.

Alternatively, we could use ""snowy"" to test S, O, W, Y and N in the second position.

I think both are acceptable. Let me choose ""snowy"" because it has more vowels? (O and Y). But Y is not always a vowel.

Alternatively, we can choose ""point"" but we cannot because N is in the 4th -> excluded.

I think I'll go with ""snowy"".

But wait, in ""snowy"", we are putting N in the 2nd position. We don't know if that's correct. But that's the point of guessing.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put N in the 3rd or 4th? We have ""snowy"" (N in 2nd) and ""nobly"" (N in 1st) and ""downy"" -> but D, O, W, N, Y -> N in the 4th -> avoid.

""tinny"": T, I, N, N, Y -> N in the 3rd and 4th? We have to avoid 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. So ""tinny"" has N in the 3rd and 4th -> we are putting N in the 4th which we know is wrong -> so it's a waste. We should avoid.

So between ""nobly"" and ""snowy"", I think ""snowy"" is a bit more common? But both are valid.

I'll choose ""snowy"".

But let me check: we are going to guess ""snowy"".

If the secret word has N in the 2nd position, we'll get a check. Otherwise, we might get a dash or nothing.

Also, we are testing S, O, W, Y.

But note: we are not using the fact that we know N is in the word? We are including N, so that's good.

Alternatively, we could avoid putting N in a position we think might be wrong? But we don't have information.

I think it's fine.

So my next guess: ""snowy""

But wait, what if the secret word has two N's? We don't know. But we are only putting one N. That's okay because we are testing one position.

We can also consider ""minks"" again. I think ""minks"" is also good.

But let me see: we have 6 tries. We are on the second guess. We can choose any.

I'll go with ""snowy"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.
- N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position.

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, E.
- Include N, but not in the 4th position (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").
- Test new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, T, O, L, I, etc.).
- Prioritize words with N in a different position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th) to narrow down its location.

After evaluating options:
- ""snowy"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits the criteria: 
  - Contains N in the 2nd position (not 4th).
  - Uses new letters (S, O, W, Y) not ruled out by previous feedback.
  - Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, E).

This guess will help test:
- If N is correctly placed in the 2nd position (✓).
- If S, O, W, or Y are present and in the right positions (✓), wrong positions (-), or absent (x).",Guess 2: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,SNOOP,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜> tags. Then, return your guessed word...""

Since this is the first guess, I should think about why I'm choosing this word as my step-by-step process.

So, my thought process:

1. This is the first guess; there's no prior feedback, so I need to choose a word that helps eliminate many possibilities.

2. I should select a word with common letters to increase the chance of getting some in the secret word.

3. ""CRANE"" is a good choice because it has three different vowels (A and E) and common consonants like C, R, N.

4. Also, no repeated letters, so it tests five distinct letters.

5. This will provide feedback on which letters are present and their positions, helping me narrow down for subsequent guesses.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

Finally, output the guess as

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
N(-) -> N is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter 'N', but not at the position we guessed (which was the 4th letter).
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.

Therefore, we must avoid using C, R, A, E in our next guess. Also, we know that the word has an 'N' but not in the 4th position.

For our next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.
- Contains the letter 'N' (but not in the 4th position).
- We might also want to include other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of common 5-letter words without C, R, A, E and that have an 'N' not in the 4th position.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word has at least one 'N'. Since 'N' is not in the 4th position, we can try placing it in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's try to come up with a word that has 'N' and uses other common letters. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, etc.

Possible words:
- We could try ""saint"": but note that we have A and we know A is not in the word -> so invalid because A is excluded.
- ""point"": P, O, I, N, T. This word doesn't have any of the excluded letters. And we can put 'N' in the 4th position? Wait, but in the feedback we were told that 'N' is not in the 4th position. So we must avoid putting 'N' in the 4th position. In ""point"", N is in the 4th position -> so we cannot use that because we know N is not in the 4th.

We need a word that has 'N' but not in the 4th. So positions for N: 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's try:
- ""linen"": L, I, N, E, N -> but E is excluded, so no.
- ""minis"": M, I, N, I, S -> but we don't know if E is excluded? Actually, E is excluded, but this word doesn't have E. However, we have two I's and two S? But that's okay. But note: we have N in the 3rd position (which is not 4th) so that's acceptable. But let's check the letters: M, I, N, I, S. None of these are C, R, A, E. So it's valid.

But maybe we can do better? We want to cover more common letters.

Another idea: ""tonic"" -> T, O, N, I, C. But C is excluded -> invalid.

""doing"": D, O, I, N, G -> N is in the 4th position? We must avoid 4th. So no.

""joint"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th -> avoid.

""mount"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th -> avoid.

""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> N is in the 1st position (not 4th) and the letters are N, I, G, H, T. None of these are excluded. So this is a candidate.

""might"": M, I, G, H, T -> but no N? We need to include N because we know the word has an N. So we must have N.

""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> N in 1st and 3rd. The 3rd is not 4th. So that's okay. But we have two N's? That's acceptable. Letters: N, I, N, T, H -> no excluded letters.

But we might get more information by using a word with more new letters.

Another candidate: ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position (not 4th). And letters: S, N, O, W, Y -> all new and not excluded.

But note: we don't know if the word has more than one N? But we only know of one N so far. However, the word might have two N's? We don't know.

Alternatively, ""downs"": D, O, W, N, S -> N is in the 4th position? We must avoid 4th -> so no.

""pints"": P, I, N, T, S -> N in the 3rd -> okay. But we have T and S which are common.

But let's consider: we have only 6 tries. We want to maximize information.

Another idea: ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> N in the 4th -> avoid.

""slung"": S, L, U, N, G -> N in the 4th -> avoid.

""singe"": but E is excluded -> invalid.

""minks"": M, I, N, K, S -> N in the 3rd -> okay. Letters: M, I, N, K, S -> all new and not excluded.

""lynch"": L, Y, N, C, H -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

So let's choose between:
- ""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> positions: N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)
- ""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> positions: N(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), H(5) -> but we have two N's. If the secret word has only one N, then we might get confusing feedback? But it's acceptable.
- ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> positions: S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)
- ""minks"": M, I, N, K, S -> positions: M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5)

We know that the secret word has an N, but not in the 4th position. So in ""minks"", N is in the 3rd (which is allowed) and we are testing positions 1,2,3,4,5 with new letters.

But note: in ""minks"", we are putting N in the 3rd. We don't know if that's correct or not, but we are trying to get more information.

Alternatively, we might avoid putting N in the 3rd if we think it might be in another position? But we have no information about other positions.

But let's stick to words without the excluded letters: C, R, A, E.

I think ""minks"" is a valid and good choice.

But let me check if there's a word that has N in the 1st or 5th? Because we haven't tested those positions for N.

For example, ""nobly"": N, O, B, L, Y -> N in the 1st. Letters: N, O, B, L, Y -> all new. This is a good candidate.

""nymph"": N, Y, M, P, H -> N in the 1st. Also good.

But ""nymph"" might be less common? We want a common word.

""nobly"" is acceptable.

So now we have:
- ""nobly"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), Y(5)
- ""night"": N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)
- ""snowy"": S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)
- ""minks"": M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5)

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test. All these words have 5 new letters (since we only know N is present, but we haven't tested any of these letters).

But note: we are also testing the position of N. We know N is not in the 4th, so we are avoiding that.

I think ""nobly"" is a good choice because it tests N in the 1st position, which we haven't tried. Also, it uses common letters? B, L, Y are common.

The instruction says: ""Think through the problem and feedback step by step."" But for the first guess, there is no feedback.\n\nLooking back at the system prompt:\n\n""Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within </think> and </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word...""\n\nSince this is the first guess, I should think about why I\'m choosing this word as my step-by-step process.\n\nSo, my thought process:\n\n1. This is the first guess; there\'s no prior feedback, so I need to choose a word that helps eliminate many possibilities.\n\n2. I should select a word with common letters to increase the chance of getting some in the secret word.\n\n3. ""CRANE"" is a good choice because it has three different vowels (A and E) and common consonants like C, R, N.\n\n4. Also, no repeated letters, so it tests five distinct letters.\n\n5. This will provide feedback on which letters are present and their positions, helping me narrow down for subsequent guesses.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""CRANE"".\n\nFinally, output the guess as\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":\nC(x) -> C is not in the secret word.\nR(x) -> R is not in the secret word.\nA(x) -> A is not in the secret word.\nN(-) -> N is in the secret word but in the wrong position.\nE(x) -> E is not in the secret word.\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter \'N\', but not at the position we guessed (which was the 4th letter).\n- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid using C, R, A, E in our next guess. Also, we know that the word has an \'N\' but not in the 4th position.\n\nFor our next guess, we should choose a word that:\n- Does not contain C, R, A, E.\n- Contains the letter \'N\' (but not in the 4th position).\n- We might also want to include other common letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think of common 5-letter words without C, R, A, E and that have an \'N\' not in the 4th position.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also know that the word has at least one \'N\'. Since \'N\' is not in the 4th position, we can try placing it in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nLet\'s try to come up with a word that has \'N\' and uses other common letters. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- We could try ""saint"": but note that we have A and we know A is not in the word -> so invalid because A is excluded.\n- ""point"": P, O, I, N, T. This word doesn\'t have any of the excluded letters. And we can put \'N\' in the 4th position? Wait, but in the feedback we were told that \'N\' is not in the 4th position. So we must avoid putting \'N\' in the 4th position. In ""point"", N is in the 4th position -> so we cannot use that because we know N is not in the 4th.\n\nWe need a word that has \'N\' but not in the 4th. So positions for N: 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nLet\'s try:\n- ""linen"": L, I, N, E, N -> but E is excluded, so no.\n- ""minis"": M, I, N, I, S -> but we don\'t know if E is excluded? Actually, E is excluded, but this word doesn\'t have E. However, we have two I\'s and two S? But that\'s okay. But note: we have N in the 3rd position (which is not 4th) so that\'s acceptable. But let\'s check the letters: M, I, N, I, S. None of these are C, R, A, E. So it\'s valid.\n\nBut maybe we can do better? We want to cover more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""tonic"" -> T, O, N, I, C. But C is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""doing"": D, O, I, N, G -> N is in the 4th position? We must avoid 4th. So no.\n\n""joint"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th -> avoid.\n\n""mount"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th -> avoid.\n\n""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> N is in the 1st position (not 4th) and the letters are N, I, G, H, T. None of these are excluded. So this is a candidate.\n\n""might"": M, I, G, H, T -> but no N? We need to include N because we know the word has an N. So we must have N.\n\n""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> N in 1st and 3rd. The 3rd is not 4th. So that\'s okay. But we have two N\'s? That\'s acceptable. Letters: N, I, N, T, H -> no excluded letters.\n\nBut we might get more information by using a word with more new letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position (not 4th). And letters: S, N, O, W, Y -> all new and not excluded.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has more than one N? But we only know of one N so far. However, the word might have two N\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, ""downs"": D, O, W, N, S -> N is in the 4th position? We must avoid 4th -> so no.\n\n""pints"": P, I, N, T, S -> N in the 3rd -> okay. But we have T and S which are common.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we have only 6 tries. We want to maximize information.\n\nAnother idea: ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> N in the 4th -> avoid.\n\n""slung"": S, L, U, N, G -> N in the 4th -> avoid.\n\n""singe"": but E is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""minks"": M, I, N, K, S -> N in the 3rd -> okay. Letters: M, I, N, K, S -> all new and not excluded.\n\n""lynch"": L, Y, N, C, H -> but C is excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo let\'s choose between:\n- ""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> positions: N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)\n- ""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> positions: N(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), H(5) -> but we have two N\'s. If the secret word has only one N, then we might get confusing feedback? But it\'s acceptable.\n- ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> positions: S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)\n- ""minks"": M, I, N, K, S -> positions: M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5)\n\nWe know that the secret word has an N, but not in the 4th position. So in ""minks"", N is in the 3rd (which is allowed) and we are testing positions 1,2,3,4,5 with new letters.\n\nBut note: in ""minks"", we are putting N in the 3rd. We don\'t know if that\'s correct or not, but we are trying to get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid putting N in the 3rd if we think it might be in another position? But we have no information about other positions.\n\nI think ""minks"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we are testing N in the 3rd position. Also, we are introducing M, I, K, S (and we already know N is present).\n\nBut we also have the option ""snowy"": which has N in the 2nd position. That might be better because we haven\'t tested the 2nd position with N? Actually, in the first guess we didn\'t have N in the 2nd because ""crane"" had N in the 4th.\n\nWe can choose either. Let me pick ""snowy"" because it has more vowels? Actually, it has O and Y (which is sometimes a vowel). But we don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has N in a different position than we tried in the first guess (which was 4th) and also covers more common consonants.\n\nI think ""minks"" is a good candidate because it has M, I, N, K, S. We are testing five new letters and one known (N). But note: we are using the known N in the 3rd position.\n\nAnother candidate: ""bongs"" -> B, O, N, G, S -> but N is in the 3rd? Actually, that\'s the same as 3rd. And we don\'t know if O is excluded? But we haven\'t been told O is excluded. However, we don\'t have any feedback on O. But wait, we haven\'t tried O. So it\'s okay.\n\nBut let\'s stick to words without the excluded letters: C, R, A, E.\n\nI think ""minks"" is a valid and good choice.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a word that has N in the 1st or 5th? Because we haven\'t tested those positions for N.\n\nFor example, ""nobly"": N, O, B, L, Y -> N in the 1st. Letters: N, O, B, L, Y -> all new. This is a good candidate.\n\n""nymph"": N, Y, M, P, H -> N in the 1st. Also good.\n\nBut ""nymph"" might be less common? We want a common word.\n\n""nobly"" is acceptable.\n\nSo now we have:\n- ""nobly"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), Y(5)\n- ""night"": N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)\n- ""snowy"": S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)\n- ""minks"": M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5)\n\nWe want to maximize the number of new letters we test. All these words have 5 new letters (since we only know N is present, but we haven\'t tested any of these letters).\n\nBut note: we are also testing the position of N. We know N is not in the 4th, so we are avoiding that.\n\nI think ""nobly"" is a good choice because it tests N in the 1st position, which we haven\'t tried. Also, it uses common letters? B, L, Y are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""snowy"" tests N in the 2nd.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we have limited tries. We want to get as much information as possible.\n\nAnother idea: we could use a word that has two N\'s? But we don\'t know if there are two. But if we use two N\'s, we can check if there are two. For example, ""ninja"": N, I, N, J, A -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""ninny"": N, I, N, N, Y -> but we have two N\'s? And Y. But we don\'t know about I and Y. However, we have two new letters: I and Y. But we are repeating N. Also, the word ""ninny"" might not be very common.\n\nI think it\'s better to use a word with one N and four new letters.\n\nI\'ll go with ""nobly"" because it tests N in the first position and introduces O, B, L, Y.\n\nBut wait, we have already excluded A, E, R, C. We are testing O, B, L, Y.\n\nAlternatively, we could use ""snowy"" to test S, O, W, Y and N in the second position.\n\nI think both are acceptable. Let me choose ""snowy"" because it has more vowels? (O and Y). But Y is not always a vowel.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""point"" but we cannot because N is in the 4th -> excluded.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""snowy"".\n\nBut wait, in ""snowy"", we are putting N in the 2nd position. We don\'t know if that\'s correct. But that\'s the point of guessing.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put N in the 3rd or 4th? We have ""snowy"" (N in 2nd) and ""nobly"" (N in 1st) and ""downy"" -> but D, O, W, N, Y -> N in the 4th -> avoid.\n\n""tinny"": T, I, N, N, Y -> N in the 3rd and 4th? We have to avoid 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. So ""tinny"" has N in the 3rd and 4th -> we are putting N in the 4th which we know is wrong -> so it\'s a waste. We should avoid.\n\nSo between ""nobly"" and ""snowy"", I think ""snowy"" is a bit more common? But both are valid.\n\nI\'ll choose ""snowy"".\n\nBut let me check: we are going to guess ""snowy"".\n\nIf the secret word has N in the 2nd position, we\'ll get a check. Otherwise, we might get a dash or nothing.\n\nAlso, we are testing S, O, W, Y.\n\nBut note: we are not using the fact that we know N is in the word? We are including N, so that\'s good.\n\nAlternatively, we could avoid putting N in a position we think might be wrong? But we don\'t have information.\n\nI think it\'s fine.\n\nSo my next guess: ""snowy""\n\nBut wait, what if the secret word has two N\'s? We don\'t know. But we are only putting one N. That\'s okay because we are testing one position.\n\nWe can also consider ""minks"" again. I think ""minks"" is also good.\n\nBut let me see: we have 6 tries. We are on the second guess. We can choose any.\n\nI\'ll go with ""snowy"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.\n- N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid using C, R, A, E.\n- Include N, but not in the 4th position (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").\n- Test new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, T, O, L, I, etc.).\n- Prioritize words with N in a different position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th) to narrow down its location.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""snowy"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits the criteria: \n  - Contains N in the 2nd position (not 4th).\n  - Uses new letters (S, O, W, Y) not ruled out by previous feedback.\n  - Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, E).\n\nThis guess will help test:\n- If N is correctly placed in the 2nd position (✓).\n- If S, O, W, or Y are present and in the right positions (✓), wrong positions (-), or absent (x).\n\n<guess>snowy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
This means:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

Guess 2: ""snowy"" -> Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)
This means:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- W is not in the word.
- Y is not in the word.

So, from the second guess, we know:
- The first three letters of the secret word are S, N, O. That is, the word starts with ""SNO"".
- W and Y are not in the word.

Additionally, from the first guess, we know:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word.
- N is in the word (which we now know is at position 2).

Now, the secret word is ""SNO"" followed by two more letters. We need to find the last two letters.

We know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, W, Y.

Also, we know that the word must have exactly 5 letters, and we have the first three.

So the word is ""SNO"" + two letters.

We need to choose a word that starts with ""SNO"" and the last two letters are from the remaining alphabet, excluding the known absent letters.

Known absent letters: C, R, A, E, W, Y.

The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z.

But note: we also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Common words that start with ""SNO"":

- snob
- snog
- snob -> but that would be 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words starting with ""SNO"":

- snobs (but S is already at the end? No, we need the word to be 5 letters and start with SNO, so the next two letters.

Let's list 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"":

- snood
- snoot
- snoop
- snout
- snows (but W is absent, so no)
- snobs (but B is possible, and S at the end? But we have to check the letters)

But note: we have feedback that W and Y are absent, so words containing W or Y are invalid.

So:

- snood: S,N,O,O,D -> but we have two O's? The feedback for O in ""snowy"" was O(✓) in position 3, so O is correct at position 3. But the word can have another O? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicate letters. However, in ""snowy"", there was only one O, so we don't know if the word has more than one O. But it's possible.

But let's check the feedback: in ""snowy"", O was in position 3 and marked correct. That doesn't prevent the word from having another O.

But we don't have any information about other positions for O.

Similarly, for N, we have it in position 2 and correct, but it might appear again? But we don't know.

However, in our case, we are looking for words starting with ""SNO"", so the first three are fixed.

Now, the last two letters:

We must avoid C, R, A, E, W, Y.

Possible words:

- snood: letters S,N,O,O,D -> the last two are O and D. But O is already in the word? We don't know if it can be repeated. Also, D is allowed.

- snoot: S,N,O,O,T -> last two O and T.

- snoop: S,N,O,O,P -> last two O and P.

- snout: S,N,O,U,T -> last two U and T.

- snobs: S,N,O,B,S -> but this has two S's? The first S is at position 1, and if we have S at the end, that would be the 5th letter. But we don't know if S can be repeated. Also, in ""snowy"", S was at position 1 and correct, but that doesn't tell us about other S's.

However, we have to consider that the feedback for ""snowy"" only said S(✓) for position 1, but if the word had another S, it might have been indicated? Not necessarily, because in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky. But in this case, since we only have one S in ""snowy"", if the secret word has two S's, we might not know.

But let's recall the rules: for a given guess, if a letter is in the word and in the correct position, it gets a ✓. If it's in the word but in the wrong position, it gets a -. If it's not in the word, it gets an x.

In ""snowy"", we have S at position 1: ✓, meaning the secret word has S at position 1. If the secret word had another S, say at position 5, then in the guess ""snowy"", we don't have an S at position 5, so we wouldn't get any additional feedback for that. So we don't know if there is a second S.

Similarly for O: we have O at position 3: ✓, but there might be another O.

But in our current guess, we are going to make a word starting with ""SNO"", so we are using S, N, O in the first three positions.

Now, for the next guess, we want to find out the last two letters.

We have several possibilities: snood, snoot, snoop, snout, etc.

But we also have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, W, Y.

So:

- snood: uses D. D is not excluded.
- snoot: uses T. T is not excluded.
- snoop: uses P. P is not excluded.
- snout: uses U and T. U and T are not excluded.

But note: we don't know if these words are valid, but they are.

We need to choose one that can give us good information.

Since we have multiple options, we might want to choose a word that has letters that are more common or that can help distinguish.

But note: we are only on the third guess, and we already have the first three letters fixed. So we are really only guessing the last two.

We can try to guess one of these words.

But let's see: if we guess ""snoot"", for example, and if it's not correct, we get feedback on the last two letters.

Similarly for others.

But we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, ""snood"" has two O's.

In the feedback for ""snowy"", we had O only at position 3, so if the word has another O, we don't know.

Similarly, for ""snobs"", it has two S's.

But ""snobs"" ends with S, and we don't know if S is repeated.

However, we can avoid words with repeated letters for now to reduce complexity? Or not.

But let's list all possible 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"" without the excluded letters.

Excluded: C, R, A, E, W, Y.

Possible words:

- snood (S,N,O,O,D)
- snoot (S,N,O,O,T)
- snoop (S,N,O,O,P)
- snout (S,N,O,U,T)
- snobs (S,N,O,B,S) -> but this has two S's, and B.

Also, are there others?

- snogs (S,N,O,G,S) -> but G is allowed, and two S's? But we have to avoid S at the end? No, we don't know.

""snogs"" is a word? It might be less common.

- snips? But that starts with SNI, not SNO.

We are fixed to SNO.

Another one: ""snows"" but W is excluded, so no.

""snort"" but R is excluded.

So the main ones are: snood, snoot, snoop, snout, and perhaps snobs.

Now, we need to choose one to guess.

We can choose ""snout"" because it has U and T, which are less common? Or we can choose one that uses letters we haven't encountered.

But we haven't encountered any of these letters except S,N,O.

We might want to test letters that are in multiple possibilities.

For example, if we guess ""snoot"", we are testing O at position 4 and T at position 5.

But if the word is ""snout"", then we would get O in the wrong position? Let's simulate.

If the secret word is ""snout"":

Our guess ""snoot"": 
- S: position 1, correct -> ✓
- N: position 2, correct -> ✓
- O: position 3, correct -> ✓
- O: position 4, but in ""snout"", the 4th letter is U, not O. And there is no second O? So the O at position 4 is not in the word? But wait, ""snout"" has only one O at position 3. So the second O in ""snoot"" is not in the word? Or is it?

In ""snout"", there is only one O. So for the guess ""snoot"", the first O (position 3) is correct. The second O (position 4) is not in the word because there is only one O. So it would be marked as x? Or -? 

According to the rules: if the letter is not in the word, it's x. But O is in the word, but we already used it once? In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times in the guess but only once in the secret, then the first occurrence (or the one that can be matched) gets the feedback, and the extra one might be marked as x.

Specifically, for ""snoot"" vs ""snout"":
- Position 1: S = S -> ✓
- Position 2: N = N -> ✓
- Position 3: O = O -> ✓
- Position 4: O: but secret has U, and there is no second O, so O is not in the word at position 4? But O is in the word, but at position 3. Since we already matched that O, the second O in the guess is extra and not present, so it should be x.

Similarly, position 5: T = T -> ✓, because ""snout"" has T at position 5.

So feedback would be: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) O(x) T(✓)

But we know the word is ""snout"", so the last two are U and T, but in ""snoot"" we have O and T, so O is wrong and T is correct.

But we don't know that yet.

To avoid confusion, we might want to guess a word that doesn't have duplicate letters.

For example, ""snout"" has no duplicates: S,N,O,U,T.

Similarly, ""snobs"" has two S's, so duplicates.

""snood"" has two O's.

""snoot"" has two O's.

""snoop"" has two O's.

So the only one without duplicates in this list is ""snout"".

Therefore, to make the feedback clearer, we can guess ""snout"".

If we guess ""snout"", and the word is ""snout"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on U and T.

But there are other possibilities like ""snood"", which has two O's.

But if we guess ""snout"", and the word is ""snood"", then:

Guess: S N O U T
Secret: S N O O D

Feedback:
- S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x) ? 
But for the O: in secret, there are two O's, at positions 3 and 4. In guess, we have O at position 3, which is correct. Then U at position 4: not in the word, so x. T at position 5: secret has D, not T, and T is not in the word? So T(x). But what about the second O in the secret? We didn't guess it, so no feedback.

But we would see that U and T are absent, and we have the first three correct.

Similarly, if the word is ""snoot"", and we guess ""snout"":

Guess: S N O U T
Secret: S N O O T

Feedback:
- S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(✓) 
Because O at position 3 is correct, U is not in the word (secret has O at 4, but we didn't guess O at 4, we guessed U, which is not present), and T at 5 is correct.

So we would know that the last letter is T, but the fourth letter is not U, and since we know it's not U, and we have other options.

But we might be able to deduce.

Since we have limited guesses, and we have the first three, we can try ""snout"" as a guess.

But note: we also have ""snood"" and ""snoot"" as possibilities.

Another word: ""snips"" is not SNO.

Or ""snubs"" but that has U and B, and S at the end, but starts with SNU, not SNO.

We must start with SNO.

So the possibilities are limited.

We can list the possible words:

1. snood
2. snoot
3. snoop
4. snout
5. snobs (if we allow two S's)

But ""snobs"": S,N,O,B,S. The last two are B and S.

Now, if we guess ""snout"", and it's not correct, we get feedback that will help eliminate.

But we are on the third guess, so we can afford to guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a possible solution but tests multiple letters for the last two positions? But that might be overkill since we have only two positions left and few possibilities.

For example, we could guess a word like ""snots"", but that has T and S, and two S's, and W is not allowed? But W is excluded, but T and S are allowed. However, ""snots"" starts with SNO, so it's a possible solution? ""snots"" is S,N,O,T,S. But we have two S's.

But let's not complicate.

I think the best is to guess one of the possible words.

Given that ""snout"" has unique letters and covers U and T, which are in other possibilities, I'll go with ""snout"".

If the word is ""snout"", we win.

If not, we get feedback that U is absent and T might be present or not.

For example, if feedback for ""snout"" is S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(✓), then we know the last letter is T, and the fourth letter is not U, so it must be O (from ""snoot"" or ""snood"") or B (from ""snobs"") or P (from ""snoop"") or D (from ""snood"")? But ""snood"" has D at the end.

But we can then make another guess.

But since we are at guess 3, we can try.

To save a guess, we might choose a word that can be the solution.

But I think ""snout"" is a good choice.

Another idea: we can guess ""snood"" to test for D and the double O.

But I think ""snout"" is fine.

So I'll go with ""snout"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
  This means:  
  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  
  - N is in the word but **not** in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: snowy** → Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)  
  This means:  
  - S is in the word and **correctly placed in position 1**.  
  - N is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2**.  
  - O is in the word and **correctly placed in position 3**.  
  - W and Y are **not** in the word.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **""SNO""** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed).  
- The word must end with two unknown letters (positions 4 and 5).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, E, W, Y (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Possible letters for positions 4 and 5**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z (since excluded letters are ruled out).  
- Common 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"" that fit the constraints:  
  - `snood` (ends with O, D)  
  - `snoot` (ends with O, T)  
  - `snoop` (ends with O, P)  
  - `snout` (ends with U, T)  
  - `snobs` (ends with B, S) — but note S could be repeated (not confirmed yet).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Since the first three letters are confirmed, focus on guessing the last two positions.  
- Choose a word that tests new letters and avoids duplicates to simplify feedback (e.g., `snout` has unique letters S,N,O,U,T).  
- `snout` is a strong candidate because:  
  - It uses `U` and `T` (common letters not tested yet).  
  - If correct, it wins. If not, feedback on U and T will help narrow the remaining possibilities (e.g., if U is absent, `snoot` or `snood` become more likely).  

<guess>snout</guess>",snout,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
This means:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

Guess 2: ""snowy"" -> Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)
This means:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- W is not in the word.
- Y is not in the word.

So, from the second guess, we know:
- The first three letters of the secret word are S, N, O. That is, the word starts with ""SNO"".
- W and Y are not in the word.

Additionally, from the first guess, we know:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word.
- N is in the word (which we now know is at position 2).

Now, the secret word is ""SNO"" followed by two more letters. We need to find the last two letters.

We know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, W, Y.

Also, we know that the word must have exactly 5 letters, and we have the first three.

So the word is ""SNO"" + two letters.

We need to choose a word that starts with ""SNO"" and the last two letters are from the remaining alphabet, excluding the known absent letters.

Known absent letters: C, R, A, E, W, Y.

The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z.

But note: we also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Common words that start with ""SNO"":

- snob
- snog
- snob -> but that would be 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words starting with ""SNO"":

- snobs (but S is already at the end? No, we need the word to be 5 letters and start with SNO, so the next two letters.

Let's list 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"":

- snood
- snoot
- snoop
- snout
- snows (but W is absent, so no)
- snobs (but B is possible, and S at the end? But we have to check the letters)

But note: we have feedback that W and Y are absent, so words containing W or Y are invalid.

So:

- snood: S,N,O,O,D -> but we have two O's? The feedback for O in ""snowy"" was O(✓) in position 3, so O is correct at position 3. But the word can have another O? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicate letters. However, in ""snowy"", there was only one O, so we don't know if the word has more than one O. But it's possible.

But let's check the feedback: in ""snowy"", O was in position 3 and marked correct. That doesn't prevent the word from having another O.

But we don't have any information about other positions for O.

Similarly, for N, we have it in position 2 and correct, but it might appear again? But we don't know.

However, in our case, we are looking for words starting with ""SNO"", so the first three are fixed.

Now, the last two letters:

We must avoid C, R, A, E, W, Y.

Possible words:

- snood: letters S,N,O,O,D -> the last two are O and D. But O is already in the word? We don't know if it can be repeated. Also, D is allowed.

- snoot: S,N,O,O,T -> last two O and T.

- snoop: S,N,O,O,P -> last two O and P.

- snout: S,N,O,U,T -> last two U and T.

- snobs: S,N,O,B,S -> but this has two S's? The first S is at position 1, and if we have S at the end, that would be the 5th letter. But we don't know if S can be repeated. Also, in ""snowy"", S was at position 1 and correct, but that doesn't tell us about other S's.

However, we have to consider that the feedback for ""snowy"" only said S(✓) for position 1, but if the word had another S, it might have been indicated? Not necessarily, because in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky. But in this case, since we only have one S in ""snowy"", if the secret word has two S's, we might not know.

But let's recall the rules: for a given guess, if a letter is in the word and in the correct position, it gets a ✓. If it's in the word but in the wrong position, it gets a -. If it's not in the word, it gets an x.

In ""snowy"", we have S at position 1: ✓, meaning the secret word has S at position 1. If the secret word had another S, say at position 5, then in the guess ""snowy"", we don't have an S at position 5, so we wouldn't get any additional feedback for that. So we don't know if there is a second S.

Similarly for O: we have O at position 3: ✓, but there might be another O.

But in our current guess, we are going to make a word starting with ""SNO"", so we are using S, N, O in the first three positions.

Now, for the next guess, we want to find out the last two letters.

We have several possibilities: snood, snoot, snoop, snout, etc.

But we also have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, W, Y.

So:

- snood: uses D. D is not excluded.
- snoot: uses T. T is not excluded.
- snoop: uses P. P is not excluded.
- snout: uses U and T. U and T are not excluded.

But note: we don't know if these words are valid, but they are.

We need to choose one that can give us good information.

Since we have multiple options, we might want to choose a word that has letters that are more common or that can help distinguish.

But note: we are only on the third guess, and we already have the first three letters fixed. So we are really only guessing the last two.

We can try to guess one of these words.

But let's see: if we guess ""snoot"", for example, and if it's not correct, we get feedback on the last two letters.

Similarly for others.

But we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, ""snood"" has two O's.

In the feedback for ""snowy"", we had O only at position 3, so if the word has another O, we don't know.

Similarly, for ""snobs"", it has two S's.

But ""snobs"" ends with S, and we don't know if S is repeated.

However, we can avoid words with repeated letters for now to reduce complexity? Or not.

But let's list all possible 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"" without the excluded letters.

Excluded: C, R, A, E, W, Y.

Possible words:

- snood (S,N,O,O,D)
- snoot (S,N,O,O,T)
- snoop (S,N,O,O,P)
- snout (S,N,O,U,T)
- snobs (S,N,O,B,S) -> but this has two S's, and B.

Also, are there others?

- snogs (S,N,O,G,S) -> but G is allowed, and two S's? But we have to avoid S at the end? No, we don't know.

""snogs"" is a word? It might be less common.

- snips? But that starts with SNI, not SNO.

We are fixed to SNO.

Another one: ""snows"" but W is excluded, so no.

""snort"" but R is excluded.

So the main ones are: snood, snoot, snoop, snout, and perhaps snobs.

Now, we need to choose one to guess.

We can choose ""snout"" because it has U and T, which are less common? Or we can choose one that uses letters we haven't encountered.

But we haven't encountered any of these letters except S,N,O.

We might want to test letters that are in multiple possibilities.

For example, if we guess ""snoot"", we are testing O at position 4 and T at position 5.

But if the word is ""snout"", then we would get O in the wrong position? Let's simulate.

If the secret word is ""snout"":

Our guess ""snoot"": 
- S: position 1, correct -> ✓
- N: position 2, correct -> ✓
- O: position 3, correct -> ✓
- O: position 4, but in ""snout"", the 4th letter is U, not O. And there is no second O? So the O at position 4 is not in the word? But wait, ""snout"" has only one O at position 3. So the second O in ""snoot"" is not in the word? Or is it?

In ""snout"", there is only one O. So for the guess ""snoot"", the first O (position 3) is correct. The second O (position 4) is not in the word because there is only one O. So it would be marked as x? Or -? 

According to the rules: if the letter is not in the word, it's x. But O is in the word, but we already used it once? In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times in the guess but only once in the secret, then the first occurrence (or the one that can be matched) gets the feedback, and the extra one might be marked as x.

Specifically, for ""snoot"" vs ""snout"":
- Position 1: S = S -> ✓
- Position 2: N = N -> ✓
- Position 3: O = O -> ✓
- Position 4: O: but secret has U, and there is no second O, so O is not in the word at position 4? But O is in the word, but at position 3. Since we already matched that O, the second O in the guess is extra and not present, so it should be x.

Similarly, position 5: T = T -> ✓, because ""snout"" has T at position 5.

So feedback would be: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) O(x) T(✓)

But we know the word is ""snout"", so the last two are U and T, but in ""snoot"" we have O and T, so O is wrong and T is correct.

But we don't know that yet.

To avoid confusion, we might want to guess a word that doesn't have duplicate letters.

For example, ""snout"" has no duplicates: S,N,O,U,T.

Similarly, ""snobs"" has two S's, so duplicates.

""snood"" has two O's.

""snoot"" has two O's.

""snoop"" has two O's.

So the only one without duplicates in this list is ""snout"".

Therefore, to make the feedback clearer, we can guess ""snout"".

If we guess ""snout"", and the word is ""snout"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on U and T.

But there are other possibilities like ""snood"", which has two O's.

But if we guess ""snout"", and the word is ""snood"", then:

Guess: S N O U T
Secret: S N O O D

Feedback:
- S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x) ? 
But for the O: in secret, there are two O's, at positions 3 and 4. In guess, we have O at position 3, which is correct. Then U at position 4: not in the word, so x. T at position 5: secret has D, not T, and T is not in the word? So T(x). But what about the second O in the secret? We didn't guess it, so no feedback.

But we would see that U and T are absent, and we have the first three correct.

Similarly, if the word is ""snoot"", and we guess ""snout"":

Guess: S N O U T
Secret: S N O O T

Feedback:
- S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(✓) 
Because O at position 3 is correct, U is not in the word (secret has O at 4, but we didn't guess O at 4, we guessed U, which is not present), and T at 5 is correct.

So we would know that the last letter is T, but the fourth letter is not U, and since we know it's not U, and we have other options.

But we might be able to deduce.

Since we have limited guesses, and we have the first three, we can try ""snout"" as a guess.

But note: we also have ""snood"" and ""snoot"" as possibilities.

Another word: ""snips"" is not SNO.

Or ""snubs"" but that has U and B, and S at the end, but starts with SNU, not SNO.

We must start with SNO.

So the possibilities are limited.

We can list the possible words:

1. snood
2. snoot
3. snoop
4. snout
5. snobs (if we allow two S's)

But ""snobs"": S,N,O,B,S. The last two are B and S.

Now, if we guess ""snout"", and it's not correct, we get feedback that will help eliminate.

But we are on the third guess, so we can afford to guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a possible solution but tests multiple letters for the last two positions? But that might be overkill since we have only two positions left and few possibilities.

For example, we could guess a word like ""snots"", but that has T and S, and two S's, and W is not allowed? But W is excluded, but T and S are allowed. However, ""snots"" starts with SNO, so it's a possible solution? ""snots"" is S,N,O,T,S. But we have two S's.

But let's not complicate.

I think the best is to guess one of the possible words.

Given that ""snout"" has unique letters and covers U and T, which are in other possibilities, I'll go with ""snout"".

If the word is ""snout"", we win.

If not, we get feedback that U is absent and T might be present or not.

For example, if feedback for ""snout"" is S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(✓), then we know the last letter is T, and the fourth letter is not U, so it must be O (from ""snoot"" or ""snood"") or B (from ""snobs"") or P (from ""snoop"") or D (from ""snood"")? But ""snood"" has D at the end.

But we can then make another guess.

But since we are at guess 3, we can try.

To save a guess, we might choose a word that can be the solution.

But I think ""snout"" is a good choice.

Another idea: we can guess ""snood"" to test for D and the double O.

But I think ""snout"" is fine.

So I'll go with ""snout"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
  This means:  
  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  
  - N is in the word but **not** in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: snowy** → Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)  
  This means:  
  - S is in the word and **correctly placed in position 1**.  
  - N is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2**.  
  - O is in the word and **correctly placed in position 3**.  
  - W and Y are **not** in the word.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **""SNO""** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed).  
- The word must end with two unknown letters (positions 4 and 5).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, E, W, Y (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Possible letters for positions 4 and 5**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z (since excluded letters are ruled out).  
- Common 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"" that fit the constraints:  
  - `snood` (ends with O, D)  
  - `snoot` (ends with O, T)  
  - `snoop` (ends with O, P)  
  - `snout` (ends with U, T)  
  - `snobs` (ends with B, S) — but note S could be repeated (not confirmed yet).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Since the first three letters are confirmed, focus on guessing the last two positions.  
- Choose a word that tests new letters and avoids duplicates to simplify feedback (e.g., `snout` has unique letters S,N,O,U,T).  
- `snout` is a strong candidate because:  
  - It uses `U` and `T` (common letters not tested yet).  
  - If correct, it wins. If not, feedback on U and T will help narrow the remaining possibilities (e.g., if U is absent, `snoot` or `snood` become more likely).",Guess 3: snout -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,SNOOP,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜> tags. Then, return your guessed word...""

Since this is the first guess, I should think about why I'm choosing this word as my step-by-step process.

So, my thought process:

1. This is the first guess; there's no prior feedback, so I need to choose a word that helps eliminate many possibilities.

2. I should select a word with common letters to increase the chance of getting some in the secret word.

3. ""CRANE"" is a good choice because it has three different vowels (A and E) and common consonants like C, R, N.

4. Also, no repeated letters, so it tests five distinct letters.

5. This will provide feedback on which letters are present and their positions, helping me narrow down for subsequent guesses.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

Finally, output the guess as

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
N(-) -> N is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter 'N', but not at the position we guessed (which was the 4th letter).
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.

Therefore, we must avoid using C, R, A, E in our next guess. Also, we know that the word has an 'N' but not in the 4th position.

For our next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.
- Contains the letter 'N' (but not in the 4th position).
- We might also want to include other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of common 5-letter words without C, R, A, E and that have an 'N' not in the 4th position.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word has at least one 'N'. Since 'N' is not in the 4th position, we can try placing it in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's try to come up with a word that has 'N' and uses other common letters. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, etc.

Possible words:
- We could try ""saint"": but note that we have A and we know A is not in the word -> so invalid because A is excluded.
- ""point"": P, O, I, N, T. This word doesn't have any of the excluded letters. And we can put 'N' in the 4th position? Wait, but in the feedback we were told that 'N' is not in the 4th position. So we must avoid putting 'N' in the 4th position. In ""point"", N is in the 4th position -> so we cannot use that because we know N is not in the 4th.

We need a word that has 'N' but not in the 4th. So positions for N: 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's try:
- ""linen"": L, I, N, E, N -> but E is excluded, so no.
- ""minis"": M, I, N, I, S -> but we don't know if E is excluded? Actually, E is excluded, but this word doesn't have E. However, we have two I's and two S? But that's okay. But note: we have N in the 3rd position (which is not 4th) so that's acceptable. But let's check the letters: M, I, N, I, S. None of these are C, R, A, E. So it's valid.

But maybe we can do better? We want to cover more common letters.

Another idea: ""tonic"" -> T, O, N, I, C. But C is excluded -> invalid.

""doing"": D, O, I, N, G -> N is in the 4th position? We must avoid 4th. So no.

""joint"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th -> avoid.

""mount"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th -> avoid.

""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> N is in the 1st position (not 4th) and the letters are N, I, G, H, T. None of these are excluded. So this is a candidate.

""might"": M, I, G, H, T -> but no N? We need to include N because we know the word has an N. So we must have N.

""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> N in 1st and 3rd. The 3rd is not 4th. So that's okay. But we have two N's? That's acceptable. Letters: N, I, N, T, H -> no excluded letters.

But we might get more information by using a word with more new letters.

Another candidate: ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position (not 4th). And letters: S, N, O, W, Y -> all new and not excluded.

But note: we don't know if the word has more than one N? But we only know of one N so far. However, the word might have two N's? We don't know.

Alternatively, ""downs"": D, O, W, N, S -> N is in the 4th position? We must avoid 4th -> so no.

""pints"": P, I, N, T, S -> N in the 3rd -> okay. But we have T and S which are common.

But let's consider: we have only 6 tries. We want to maximize information.

Another idea: ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> N in the 4th -> avoid.

""slung"": S, L, U, N, G -> N in the 4th -> avoid.

""singe"": but E is excluded -> invalid.

""minks"": M, I, N, K, S -> N in the 3rd -> okay. Letters: M, I, N, K, S -> all new and not excluded.

""lynch"": L, Y, N, C, H -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

So let's choose between:
- ""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> positions: N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)
- ""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> positions: N(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), H(5) -> but we have two N's. If the secret word has only one N, then we might get confusing feedback? But it's acceptable.
- ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> positions: S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)
- ""minks"": M, I, N, K, S -> positions: M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5)

We know that the secret word has an N, but not in the 4th position. So in ""minks"", N is in the 3rd (which is allowed) and we are testing positions 1,2,3,4,5 with new letters.

But note: in ""minks"", we are putting N in the 3rd. We don't know if that's correct or not, but we are trying to get more information.

Alternatively, we might avoid putting N in the 3rd if we think it might be in another position? But we have no information about other positions.

I think ""minks"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we are testing N in the 3rd position. Also, we are introducing M, I, K, S (and we already know N is present).

But we also have the option ""snowy"": which has N in the 2nd position. That might be better because we haven't tested the 2nd position with N? Actually, in the first guess we didn't have N in the 2nd because ""crane"" had N in the 4th.

We can choose either. Let me pick ""snowy"" because it has more vowels? Actually, it has O and Y (which is sometimes a vowel). But we don't know if O is in the word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in a different position than we tried in the first guess (which was 4th) and also covers more common consonants.

I think ""minks"" is a good candidate because it has M, I, N, K, S. We are testing five new letters and one known (N). But note: we are using the known N in the 3rd position.

Another candidate: ""bongs"" -> B, O, N, G, S -> but N is in the 3rd? Actually, that's the same as 3rd. And we don't know if O is excluded? But we haven't been told O is excluded. However, we don't have any feedback on O. But wait, we haven't tried O. So it's okay.

But let's stick to words without the excluded letters: C, R, A, E.

I think ""minks"" is a valid and good choice.

But let me check if there's a word that has N in the 1st or 5th? Because we haven't tested those positions for N.

For example, ""nobly"": N, O, B, L, Y -> N in the 1st. Letters: N, O, B, L, Y -> all new. This is a good candidate.

""nymph"": N, Y, M, P, H -> N in the 1st. Also good.

But ""nymph"" might be less common? We want a common word.

""nobly"" is acceptable.

So now we have:
- ""nobly"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), Y(5)
- ""night"": N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)
- ""snowy"": S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)
- ""minks"": M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5)

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test. All these words have 5 new letters (since we only know N is present, but we haven't tested any of these letters).

But note: we are also testing the position of N. We know N is not in the 4th, so we are avoiding that.

I think ""nobly"" is a good choice because it tests N in the 1st position, which we haven't tried. Also, it uses common letters? B, L, Y are common.

Alternatively, ""snowy"" tests N in the 2nd.

But let's consider: we have limited tries. We want to get as much information as possible.

Another idea: we could use a word that has two N's? But we don't know if there are two. But if we use two N's, we can check if there are two. For example, ""ninja"": N, I, N, J, A -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

""ninny"": N, I, N, N, Y -> but we have two N's? And Y. But we don't know about I and Y. However, we have two new letters: I and Y. But we are repeating N. Also, the word ""ninny"" might not be very common.

I think it's better to use a word with one N and four new letters.

I'll go with ""nobly"" because it tests N in the first position and introduces O, B, L, Y.

But wait, we have already excluded A, E, R, C. We are testing O, B, L, Y.

Alternatively, we could use ""snowy"" to test S, O, W, Y and N in the second position.

I think both are acceptable. Let me choose ""snowy"" because it has more vowels? (O and Y). But Y is not always a vowel.

Alternatively, we can choose ""point"" but we cannot because N is in the 4th -> excluded.

I think I'll go with ""snowy"".

But wait, in ""snowy"", we are putting N in the 2nd position. We don't know if that's correct. But that's the point of guessing.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put N in the 3rd or 4th? We have ""snowy"" (N in 2nd) and ""nobly"" (N in 1st) and ""downy"" -> but D, O, W, N, Y -> N in the 4th -> avoid.

""tinny"": T, I, N, N, Y -> N in the 3rd and 4th? We have to avoid 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. So ""tinny"" has N in the 3rd and 4th -> we are putting N in the 4th which we know is wrong -> so it's a waste. We should avoid.

So between ""nobly"" and ""snowy"", I think ""snowy"" is a bit more common? But both are valid.

I'll choose ""snowy"".

But let me check: we are going to guess ""snowy"".

If the secret word has N in the 2nd position, we'll get a check. Otherwise, we might get a dash or nothing.

Also, we are testing S, O, W, Y.

But note: we are not using the fact that we know N is in the word? We are including N, so that's good.

Alternatively, we could avoid putting N in a position we think might be wrong? But we don't have information.

I think it's fine.

So my next guess: ""snowy""

But wait, what if the secret word has two N's? We don't know. But we are only putting one N. That's okay because we are testing one position.

We can also consider ""minks"" again. I think ""minks"" is also good.

But let me see: we have 6 tries. We are on the second guess. We can choose any.

I'll go with ""snowy"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.
- N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position.

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, E.
- Include N, but not in the 4th position (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").
- Test new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, T, O, L, I, etc.).
- Prioritize words with N in a different position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th) to narrow down its location.

After evaluating options:
- ""snowy"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits the criteria: 
  - Contains N in the 2nd position (not 4th).
  - Uses new letters (S, O, W, Y) not ruled out by previous feedback.
  - Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, E).

This guess will help test:
- If N is correctly placed in the 2nd position (✓).
- If S, O, W, or Y are present and in the right positions (✓), wrong positions (-), or absent (x).

<guess>snowy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
This means:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

Guess 2: ""snowy"" -> Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)
This means:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- W is not in the word.
- Y is not in the word.

So, from the second guess, we know:
- The first three letters of the secret word are S, N, O. That is, the word starts with ""SNO"".
- W and Y are not in the word.

Additionally, from the first guess, we know:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word.
- N is in the word (which we now know is at position 2).

Now, the secret word is ""SNO"" followed by two more letters. We need to find the last two letters.

We know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, W, Y.

Also, we know that the word must have exactly 5 letters, and we have the first three.

So the word is ""SNO"" + two letters.

We need to choose a word that starts with ""SNO"" and the last two letters are from the remaining alphabet, excluding the known absent letters.

Known absent letters: C, R, A, E, W, Y.

The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z.

But note: we also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Common words that start with ""SNO"":

- snob
- snog
- snob -> but that would be 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words starting with ""SNO"":

- snobs (but S is already at the end? No, we need the word to be 5 letters and start with SNO, so the next two letters.

Let's list 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"":

- snood
- snoot
- snoop
- snout
- snows (but W is absent, so no)
- snobs (but B is possible, and S at the end? But we have to check the letters)

But note: we have feedback that W and Y are absent, so words containing W or Y are invalid.

So:

- snood: S,N,O,O,D -> but we have two O's? The feedback for O in ""snowy"" was O(✓) in position 3, so O is correct at position 3. But the word can have another O? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicate letters. However, in ""snowy"", there was only one O, so we don't know if the word has more than one O. But it's possible.

But let's check the feedback: in ""snowy"", O was in position 3 and marked correct. That doesn't prevent the word from having another O.

But we don't have any information about other positions for O.

Similarly, for N, we have it in position 2 and correct, but it might appear again? But we don't know.

However, in our case, we are looking for words starting with ""SNO"", so the first three are fixed.

Now, the last two letters:

We must avoid C, R, A, E, W, Y.

Possible words:

- snood: letters S,N,O,O,D -> the last two are O and D. But O is already in the word? We don't know if it can be repeated. Also, D is allowed.

- snoot: S,N,O,O,T -> last two O and T.

- snoop: S,N,O,O,P -> last two O and P.

- snout: S,N,O,U,T -> last two U and T.

- snobs: S,N,O,B,S -> but this has two S's? The first S is at position 1, and if we have S at the end, that would be the 5th letter. But we don't know if S can be repeated. Also, in ""snowy"", S was at position 1 and correct, but that doesn't tell us about other S's.

However, we have to consider that the feedback for ""snowy"" only said S(✓) for position 1, but if the word had another S, it might have been indicated? Not necessarily, because in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky. But in this case, since we only have one S in ""snowy"", if the secret word has two S's, we might not know.

But let's recall the rules: for a given guess, if a letter is in the word and in the correct position, it gets a ✓. If it's in the word but in the wrong position, it gets a -. If it's not in the word, it gets an x.

In ""snowy"", we have S at position 1: ✓, meaning the secret word has S at position 1. If the secret word had another S, say at position 5, then in the guess ""snowy"", we don't have an S at position 5, so we wouldn't get any additional feedback for that. So we don't know if there is a second S.

Similarly for O: we have O at position 3: ✓, but there might be another O.

But in our current guess, we are going to make a word starting with ""SNO"", so we are using S, N, O in the first three positions.

Now, for the next guess, we want to find out the last two letters.

We have several possibilities: snood, snoot, snoop, snout, etc.

But we also have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, W, Y.

So:

- snood: uses D. D is not excluded.
- snoot: uses T. T is not excluded.
- snoop: uses P. P is not excluded.
- snout: uses U and T. U and T are not excluded.

But note: we don't know if these words are valid, but they are.

We need to choose one that can give us good information.

Since we have multiple options, we might want to choose a word that has letters that are more common or that can help distinguish.

But note: we are only on the third guess, and we already have the first three letters fixed. So we are really only guessing the last two.

We can try to guess one of these words.

But let's see: if we guess ""snoot"", for example, and if it's not correct, we get feedback on the last two letters.

Similarly for others.

But we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, ""snood"" has two O's.

In the feedback for ""snowy"", we had O only at position 3, so if the word has another O, we don't know.

Similarly, for ""snobs"", it has two S's.

But ""snobs"" ends with S, and we don't know if S is repeated.

However, we can avoid words with repeated letters for now to reduce complexity? Or not.

But let's list all possible 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"" without the excluded letters.

Excluded: C, R, A, E, W, Y.

Possible words:

- snood (S,N,O,O,D)
- snoot (S,N,O,O,T)
- snoop (S,N,O,O,P)
- snout (S,N,O,U,T)
- snobs (S,N,O,B,S) -> but this has two S's, and B.

Also, are there others?

- snogs (S,N,O,G,S) -> but G is allowed, and two S's? But we have to avoid S at the end? No, we don't know.

""snogs"" is a word? It might be less common.

- snips? But that starts with SNI, not SNO.

We are fixed to SNO.

Another one: ""snows"" but W is excluded, so no.

""snort"" but R is excluded.

So the main ones are: snood, snoot, snoop, snout, and perhaps snobs.

Now, we need to choose one to guess.

We can choose ""snout"" because it has U and T, which are less common? Or we can choose one that uses letters we haven't encountered.

But we haven't encountered any of these letters except S,N,O.

We might want to test letters that are in multiple possibilities.

For example, if we guess ""snoot"", we are testing O at position 4 and T at position 5.

But if the word is ""snout"", then we would get O in the wrong position? Let's simulate.

If the secret word is ""snout"":

Our guess ""snoot"": 
- S: position 1, correct -> ✓
- N: position 2, correct -> ✓
- O: position 3, correct -> ✓
- O: position 4, but in ""snout"", the 4th letter is U, not O. And there is no second O? So the O at position 4 is not in the word? But wait, ""snout"" has only one O at position 3. So the second O in ""snoot"" is not in the word? Or is it?

In ""snout"", there is only one O. So for the guess ""snoot"", the first O (position 3) is correct. The second O (position 4) is not in the word because there is only one O. So it would be marked as x? Or -? 

According to the rules: if the letter is not in the word, it's x. But O is in the word, but we already used it once? In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times in the guess but only once in the secret, then the first occurrence (or the one that can be matched) gets the feedback, and the extra one might be marked as x.

Specifically, for ""snoot"" vs ""snout"":
- Position 1: S = S -> ✓
- Position 2: N = N -> ✓
- Position 3: O = O -> ✓
- Position 4: O: but secret has U, and there is no second O, so O is not in the word at position 4? But O is in the word, but at position 3. Since we already matched that O, the second O in the guess is extra and not present, so it should be x.

Similarly, position 5: T = T -> ✓, because ""snout"" has T at position 5.

So feedback would be: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) O(x) T(✓)

But we know the word is ""snout"", so the last two are U and T, but in ""snoot"" we have O and T, so O is wrong and T is correct.

But we don't know that yet.

To avoid confusion, we might want to guess a word that doesn't have duplicate letters.

For example, ""snout"" has no duplicates: S,N,O,U,T.

Similarly, ""snobs"" has two S's, so duplicates.

""snood"" has two O's.

""snoot"" has two O's.

""snoop"" has two O's.

So the only one without duplicates in this list is ""snout"".

Therefore, to make the feedback clearer, we can guess ""snout"".

If we guess ""snout"", and the word is ""snout"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on U and T.

But there are other possibilities like ""snood"", which has two O's.

But if we guess ""snout"", and the word is ""snood"", then:

Guess: S N O U T
Secret: S N O O D

Feedback:
- S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x) ? 
But for the O: in secret, there are two O's, at positions 3 and 4. In guess, we have O at position 3, which is correct. Then U at position 4: not in the word, so x. T at position 5: secret has D, not T, and T is not in the word? So T(x). But what about the second O in the secret? We didn't guess it, so no feedback.

But we would see that U and T are absent, and we have the first three correct.

Similarly, if the word is ""snoot"", and we guess ""snout"":

Guess: S N O U T
Secret: S N O O T

Feedback:
- S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(✓) 
Because O at position 3 is correct, U is not in the word (secret has O at 4, but we didn't guess O at 4, we guessed U, which is not present), and T at 5 is correct.

So we would know that the last letter is T, but the fourth letter is not U, and since we know it's not U, and we have other options.

But we might be able to deduce.

Since we have limited guesses, and we have the first three, we can try ""snout"" as a guess.

But note: we also have ""snood"" and ""snoot"" as possibilities.

Another word: ""snips"" is not SNO.

Or ""snubs"" but that has U and B, and S at the end, but starts with SNU, not SNO.

We must start with SNO.

So the possibilities are limited.

We can list the possible words:

1. snood
2. snoot
3. snoop
4. snout
5. snobs (if we allow two S's)

But ""snobs"": S,N,O,B,S. The last two are B and S.

Now, if we guess ""snout"", and it's not correct, we get feedback that will help eliminate.

But we are on the third guess, so we can afford to guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a possible solution but tests multiple letters for the last two positions? But that might be overkill since we have only two positions left and few possibilities.

For example, we could guess a word like ""snots"", but that has T and S, and two S's, and W is not allowed? But W is excluded, but T and S are allowed. However, ""snots"" starts with SNO, so it's a possible solution? ""snots"" is S,N,O,T,S. But we have two S's.

But let's not complicate.

I think the best is to guess one of the possible words.

Given that ""snout"" has unique letters and covers U and T, which are in other possibilities, I'll go with ""snout"".

If the word is ""snout"", we win.

If not, we get feedback that U is absent and T might be present or not.

For example, if feedback for ""snout"" is S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(✓), then we know the last letter is T, and the fourth letter is not U, so it must be O (from ""snoot"" or ""snood"") or B (from ""snobs"") or P (from ""snoop"") or D (from ""snood"")? But ""snood"" has D at the end.

But we can then make another guess.

But since we are at guess 3, we can try.

To save a guess, we might choose a word that can be the solution.

But I think ""snout"" is a good choice.

Another idea: we can guess ""snood"" to test for D and the double O.

But I think ""snout"" is fine.

So I'll go with ""snout"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
  This means:  
  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  
  - N is in the word but **not** in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: snowy** → Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)  
  This means:  
  - S is in the word and **correctly placed in position 1**.  
  - N is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2**.  
  - O is in the word and **correctly placed in position 3**.  
  - W and Y are **not** in the word.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **""SNO""** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed).  
- The word must end with two unknown letters (positions 4 and 5).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, E, W, Y (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Possible letters for positions 4 and 5**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z (since excluded letters are ruled out).  
- Common 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"" that fit the constraints:  
  - `snood` (ends with O, D)  
  - `snoot` (ends with O, T)  
  - `snoop` (ends with O, P)  
  - `snout` (ends with U, T)  
  - `snobs` (ends with B, S) — but note S could be repeated (not confirmed yet).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Since the first three letters are confirmed, focus on guessing the last two positions.  
- Choose a word that tests new letters and avoids duplicates to simplify feedback (e.g., `snout` has unique letters S,N,O,U,T).  
- `snout` is a strong candidate because:  
  - It uses `U` and `T` (common letters not tested yet).  
  - If correct, it wins. If not, feedback on U and T will help narrow the remaining possibilities (e.g., if U is absent, `snoot` or `snood` become more likely).

We want to cover more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""tonic"" -> T, O, N, I, C. But C is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""doing"": D, O, I, N, G -> N is in the 4th position? We must avoid 4th. So no.\n\n""joint"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th -> avoid.\n\n""mount"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th -> avoid.\n\n""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> N is in the 1st position (not 4th) and the letters are N, I, G, H, T. None of these are excluded. So this is a candidate.\n\n""might"": M, I, G, H, T -> but no N? We need to include N because we know the word has an N. So we must have N.\n\n""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> N in 1st and 3rd. The 3rd is not 4th. So that\'s okay. But we have two N\'s? That\'s acceptable. Letters: N, I, N, T, H -> no excluded letters.\n\nBut we might get more information by using a word with more new letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position (not 4th). And letters: S, N, O, W, Y -> all new and not excluded.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has more than one N? But we only know of one N so far. However, the word might have two N\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, ""downs"": D, O, W, N, S -> N is in the 4th position? We must avoid 4th -> so no.\n\n""pints"": P, I, N, T, S -> N in the 3rd -> okay. But we have T and S which are common.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we have only 6 tries. We want to maximize information.\n\nAnother idea: ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> N in the 4th -> avoid.\n\n""slung"": S, L, U, N, G -> N in the 4th -> avoid.\n\n""singe"": but E is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""minks"": M, I, N, K, S -> N in the 3rd -> okay. Letters: M, I, N, K, S -> all new and not excluded.\n\n""lynch"": L, Y, N, C, H -> but C is excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo let\'s choose between:\n- ""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> positions: N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)\n- ""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> positions: N(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), H(5) -> but we have two N\'s. If the secret word has only one N, then we might get confusing feedback? But it\'s acceptable.\n- ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> positions: S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)\n- ""minks"": M, I, N, K, S -> positions: M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5)\n\nWe know that the secret word has an N, but not in the 4th position. So in ""minks"", N is in the 3rd (which is allowed) and we are testing positions 1,2,3,4,5 with new letters.\n\nBut note: in ""minks"", we are putting N in the 3rd. We don\'t know if that\'s correct or not, but we are trying to get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid putting N in the 3rd if we think it might be in another position? But we have no information about other positions.\n\nI think ""minks"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we are testing N in the 3rd position. Also, we are introducing M, I, K, S (and we already know N is present).\n\nBut we also have the option ""snowy"": which has N in the 2nd position. That might be better because we haven\'t tested the 2nd position with N? Actually, in the first guess we didn\'t have N in the 2nd because ""crane"" had N in the 4th.\n\nWe can choose either. Let me pick ""snowy"" because it has more vowels? Actually, it has O and Y (which is sometimes a vowel). But we don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has N in a different position than we tried in the first guess (which was 4th) and also covers more common consonants.\n\nI think ""minks"" is a good candidate because it has M, I, N, K, S. We are testing five new letters and one known (N). But note: we are using the known N in the 3rd position.\n\nAnother candidate: ""bongs"" -> B, O, N, G, S -> but N is in the 3rd? Actually, that\'s the same as 3rd. And we don\'t know if O is excluded? But we haven\'t been told O is excluded. However, we don\'t have any feedback on O. But wait, we haven\'t tried O. So it\'s okay.\n\nBut let\'s stick to words without the excluded letters: C, R, A, E.\n\nI think ""minks"" is a valid and good choice.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a word that has N in the 1st or 5th? Because we haven\'t tested those positions for N.\n\nFor example, ""nobly"": N, O, B, L, Y -> N in the 1st. Letters: N, O, B, L, Y -> all new. This is a good candidate.\n\n""nymph"": N, Y, M, P, H -> N in the 1st. Also good.\n\nBut ""nymph"" might be less common? We want a common word.\n\n""nobly"" is acceptable.\n\nSo now we have:\n- ""nobly"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), Y(5)\n- ""night"": N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)\n- ""snowy"": S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)\n- ""minks"": M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5)\n\nWe want to maximize the number of new letters we test. All these words have 5 new letters (since we only know N is present, but we haven\'t tested any of these letters).\n\nBut note: we are also testing the position of N. We know N is not in the 4th, so we are avoiding that.\n\nI think ""nobly"" is a good choice because it tests N in the 1st position, which we haven\'t tried. Also, it uses common letters? B, L, Y are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""snowy"" tests N in the 2nd.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we have limited tries. We want to get as much information as possible.\n\nAnother idea: we could use a word that has two N\'s? But we don\'t know if there are two. But if we use two N\'s, we can check if there are two. For example, ""ninja"": N, I, N, J, A -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""ninny"": N, I, N, N, Y -> but we have two N\'s? And Y. But we don\'t know about I and Y. However, we have two new letters: I and Y. But we are repeating N. Also, the word ""ninny"" might not be very common.\n\nI think it\'s better to use a word with one N and four new letters.\n\nI\'ll go with ""nobly"" because it tests N in the first position and introduces O, B, L, Y.\n\nBut wait, we have already excluded A, E, R, C. We are testing O, B, L, Y.\n\nAlternatively, we could use ""snowy"" to test S, O, W, Y and N in the second position.\n\nI think both are acceptable. Let me choose ""snowy"" because it has more vowels? (O and Y). But Y is not always a vowel.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""point"" but we cannot because N is in the 4th -> excluded.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""snowy"".\n\nBut wait, in ""snowy"", we are putting N in the 2nd position. We don\'t know if that\'s correct. But that\'s the point of guessing.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put N in the 3rd or 4th? We have ""snowy"" (N in 2nd) and ""nobly"" (N in 1st) and ""downy"" -> but D, O, W, N, Y -> N in the 4th -> avoid.\n\n""tinny"": T, I, N, N, Y -> N in the 3rd and 4th? We have to avoid 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. So ""tinny"" has N in the 3rd and 4th -> we are putting N in the 4th which we know is wrong -> so it\'s a waste. We should avoid.\n\nSo between ""nobly"" and ""snowy"", I think ""snowy"" is a bit more common? But both are valid.\n\nI\'ll choose ""snowy"".\n\nBut let me check: we are going to guess ""snowy"".\n\nIf the secret word has N in the 2nd position, we\'ll get a check. Otherwise, we might get a dash or nothing.\n\nAlso, we are testing S, O, W, Y.\n\nBut note: we are not using the fact that we know N is in the word? We are including N, so that\'s good.\n\nAlternatively, we could avoid putting N in a position we think might be wrong? But we don\'t have information.\n\nI think it\'s fine.\n\nSo my next guess: ""snowy""\n\nBut wait, what if the secret word has two N\'s? We don\'t know. But we are only putting one N. That\'s okay because we are testing one position.\n\nWe can also consider ""minks"" again. I think ""minks"" is also good.\n\nBut let me see: we have 6 tries. We are on the second guess. We can choose any.\n\nI\'ll go with ""snowy"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.\n- N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid using C, R, A, E.\n- Include N, but not in the 4th position (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").\n- Test new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, T, O, L, I, etc.).\n- Prioritize words with N in a different position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th) to narrow down its location.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""snowy"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits the criteria: \n  - Contains N in the 2nd position (not 4th).\n  - Uses new letters (S, O, W, Y) not ruled out by previous feedback.\n  - Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, E).\n\nThis guess will help test:\n- If N is correctly placed in the 2nd position (✓).\n- If S, O, W, or Y are present and in the right positions (✓), wrong positions (-), or absent (x).\n\n<guess>snowy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nThis means:\n- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.\n- N is in the word but not in the 4th position.\n\nGuess 2: ""snowy"" -> Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)\nThis means:\n- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).\n- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).\n- W is not in the word.\n- Y is not in the word.\n\nSo, from the second guess, we know:\n- The first three letters of the secret word are S, N, O. That is, the word starts with ""SNO"".\n- W and Y are not in the word.\n\nAdditionally, from the first guess, we know:\n- C, R, A, E are not in the word.\n- N is in the word (which we now know is at position 2).\n\nNow, the secret word is ""SNO"" followed by two more letters. We need to find the last two letters.\n\nWe know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, W, Y.\n\nAlso, we know that the word must have exactly 5 letters, and we have the first three.\n\nSo the word is ""SNO"" + two letters.\n\nWe need to choose a word that starts with ""SNO"" and the last two letters are from the remaining alphabet, excluding the known absent letters.\n\nKnown absent letters: C, R, A, E, W, Y.\n\nThe remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z.\n\nBut note: we also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nCommon words that start with ""SNO"":\n\n- snob\n- snog\n- snob -> but that would be 4 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\n5-letter words starting with ""SNO"":\n\n- snobs (but S is already at the end? No, we need the word to be 5 letters and start with SNO, so the next two letters.\n\nLet\'s list 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"":\n\n- snood\n- snoot\n- snoop\n- snout\n- snows (but W is absent, so no)\n- snobs (but B is possible, and S at the end? But we have to check the letters)\n\nBut note: we have feedback that W and Y are absent, so words containing W or Y are invalid.\n\nSo:\n\n- snood: S,N,O,O,D -> but we have two O\'s? The feedback for O in ""snowy"" was O(✓) in position 3, so O is correct at position 3. But the word can have another O? The feedback doesn\'t say anything about duplicate letters. However, in ""snowy"", there was only one O, so we don\'t know if the word has more than one O. But it\'s possible.\n\nBut let\'s check the feedback: in ""snowy"", O was in position 3 and marked correct. That doesn\'t prevent the word from having another O.\n\nBut we don\'t have any information about other positions for O.\n\nSimilarly, for N, we have it in position 2 and correct, but it might appear again? But we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, in our case, we are looking for words starting with ""SNO"", so the first three are fixed.\n\nNow, the last two letters:\n\nWe must avoid C, R, A, E, W, Y.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- snood: letters S,N,O,O,D -> the last two are O and D. But O is already in the word? We don\'t know if it can be repeated. Also, D is allowed.\n\n- snoot: S,N,O,O,T -> last two O and T.\n\n- snoop: S,N,O,O,P -> last two O and P.\n\n- snout: S,N,O,U,T -> last two U and T.\n\n- snobs: S,N,O,B,S -> but this has two S\'s? The first S is at position 1, and if we have S at the end, that would be the 5th letter. But we don\'t know if S can be repeated. Also, in ""snowy"", S was at position 1 and correct, but that doesn\'t tell us about other S\'s.\n\nHowever, we have to consider that the feedback for ""snowy"" only said S(✓) for position 1, but if the word had another S, it might have been indicated? Not necessarily, because in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky. But in this case, since we only have one S in ""snowy"", if the secret word has two S\'s, we might not know.\n\nBut let\'s recall the rules: for a given guess, if a letter is in the word and in the correct position, it gets a ✓. If it\'s in the word but in the wrong position, it gets a -. If it\'s not in the word, it gets an x.\n\nIn ""snowy"", we have S at position 1: ✓, meaning the secret word has S at position 1. If the secret word had another S, say at position 5, then in the guess ""snowy"", we don\'t have an S at position 5, so we wouldn\'t get any additional feedback for that. So we don\'t know if there is a second S.\n\nSimilarly for O: we have O at position 3: ✓, but there might be another O.\n\nBut in our current guess, we are going to make a word starting with ""SNO"", so we are using S, N, O in the first three positions.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we want to find out the last two letters.\n\nWe have several possibilities: snood, snoot, snoop, snout, etc.\n\nBut we also have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, W, Y.\n\nSo:\n\n- snood: uses D. D is not excluded.\n- snoot: uses T. T is not excluded.\n- snoop: uses P. P is not excluded.\n- snout: uses U and T. U and T are not excluded.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if these words are valid, but they are.\n\nWe need to choose one that can give us good information.\n\nSince we have multiple options, we might want to choose a word that has letters that are more common or that can help distinguish.\n\nBut note: we are only on the third guess, and we already have the first three letters fixed. So we are really only guessing the last two.\n\nWe can try to guess one of these words.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess ""snoot"", for example, and if it\'s not correct, we get feedback on the last two letters.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, ""snood"" has two O\'s.\n\nIn the feedback for ""snowy"", we had O only at position 3, so if the word has another O, we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, for ""snobs"", it has two S\'s.\n\nBut ""snobs"" ends with S, and we don\'t know if S is repeated.\n\nHowever, we can avoid words with repeated letters for now to reduce complexity? Or not.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"" without the excluded letters.\n\nExcluded: C, R, A, E, W, Y.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- snood (S,N,O,O,D)\n- snoot (S,N,O,O,T)\n- snoop (S,N,O,O,P)\n- snout (S,N,O,U,T)\n- snobs (S,N,O,B,S) -> but this has two S\'s, and B.\n\nAlso, are there others?\n\n- snogs (S,N,O,G,S) -> but G is allowed, and two S\'s? But we have to avoid S at the end? No, we don\'t know.\n\n""snogs"" is a word? It might be less common.\n\n- snips? But that starts with SNI, not SNO.\n\nWe are fixed to SNO.\n\nAnother one: ""snows"" but W is excluded, so no.\n\n""snort"" but R is excluded.\n\nSo the main ones are: snood, snoot, snoop, snout, and perhaps snobs.\n\nNow, we need to choose one to guess.\n\nWe can choose ""snout"" because it has U and T, which are less common? Or we can choose one that uses letters we haven\'t encountered.\n\nBut we haven\'t encountered any of these letters except S,N,O.\n\nWe might want to test letters that are in multiple possibilities.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""snoot"", we are testing O at position 4 and T at position 5.\n\nBut if the word is ""snout"", then we would get O in the wrong position? Let\'s simulate.\n\nIf the secret word is ""snout"":\n\nOur guess ""snoot"": \n- S: position 1, correct -> ✓\n- N: position 2, correct -> ✓\n- O: position 3, correct -> ✓\n- O: position 4, but in ""snout"", the 4th letter is U, not O. And there is no second O? So the O at position 4 is not in the word? But wait, ""snout"" has only one O at position 3. So the second O in ""snoot"" is not in the word? Or is it?\n\nIn ""snout"", there is only one O. So for the guess ""snoot"", the first O (position 3) is correct. The second O (position 4) is not in the word because there is only one O. So it would be marked as x? Or -? \n\nAccording to the rules: if the letter is not in the word, it\'s x. But O is in the word, but we already used it once? In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times in the guess but only once in the secret, then the first occurrence (or the one that can be matched) gets the feedback, and the extra one might be marked as x.\n\nSpecifically, for ""snoot"" vs ""snout"":\n- Position 1: S = S -> ✓\n- Position 2: N = N -> ✓\n- Position 3: O = O -> ✓\n- Position 4: O: but secret has U, and there is no second O, so O is not in the word at position 4? But O is in the word, but at position 3. Since we already matched that O, the second O in the guess is extra and not present, so it should be x.\n\nSimilarly, position 5: T = T -> ✓, because ""snout"" has T at position 5.\n\nSo feedback would be: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) O(x) T(✓)\n\nBut we know the word is ""snout"", so the last two are U and T, but in ""snoot"" we have O and T, so O is wrong and T is correct.\n\nBut we don\'t know that yet.\n\nTo avoid confusion, we might want to guess a word that doesn\'t have duplicate letters.\n\nFor example, ""snout"" has no duplicates: S,N,O,U,T.\n\nSimilarly, ""snobs"" has two S\'s, so duplicates.\n\n""snood"" has two O\'s.\n\n""snoot"" has two O\'s.\n\n""snoop"" has two O\'s.\n\nSo the only one without duplicates in this list is ""snout"".\n\nTherefore, to make the feedback clearer, we can guess ""snout"".\n\nIf we guess ""snout"", and the word is ""snout"", we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on U and T.\n\nBut there are other possibilities like ""snood"", which has two O\'s.\n\nBut if we guess ""snout"", and the word is ""snood"", then:\n\nGuess: S N O U T\nSecret: S N O O D\n\nFeedback:\n- S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x) ? \nBut for the O: in secret, there are two O\'s, at positions 3 and 4. In guess, we have O at position 3, which is correct. Then U at position 4: not in the word, so x. T at position 5: secret has D, not T, and T is not in the word? So T(x). But what about the second O in the secret? We didn\'t guess it, so no feedback.\n\nBut we would see that U and T are absent, and we have the first three correct.\n\nSimilarly, if the word is ""snoot"", and we guess ""snout"":\n\nGuess: S N O U T\nSecret: S N O O T\n\nFeedback:\n- S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(✓) \nBecause O at position 3 is correct, U is not in the word (secret has O at 4, but we didn\'t guess O at 4, we guessed U, which is not present), and T at 5 is correct.\n\nSo we would know that the last letter is T, but the fourth letter is not U, and since we know it\'s not U, and we have other options.\n\nBut we might be able to deduce.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, and we have the first three, we can try ""snout"" as a guess.\n\nBut note: we also have ""snood"" and ""snoot"" as possibilities.\n\nAnother word: ""snips"" is not SNO.\n\nOr ""snubs"" but that has U and B, and S at the end, but starts with SNU, not SNO.\n\nWe must start with SNO.\n\nSo the possibilities are limited.\n\nWe can list the possible words:\n\n1. snood\n2. snoot\n3. snoop\n4. snout\n5. snobs (if we allow two S\'s)\n\nBut ""snobs"": S,N,O,B,S. The last two are B and S.\n\nNow, if we guess ""snout"", and it\'s not correct, we get feedback that will help eliminate.\n\nBut we are on the third guess, so we can afford to guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a possible solution but tests multiple letters for the last two positions? But that might be overkill since we have only two positions left and few possibilities.\n\nFor example, we could guess a word like ""snots"", but that has T and S, and two S\'s, and W is not allowed? But W is excluded, but T and S are allowed. However, ""snots"" starts with SNO, so it\'s a possible solution? ""snots"" is S,N,O,T,S. But we have two S\'s.\n\nBut let\'s not complicate.\n\nI think the best is to guess one of the possible words.\n\nGiven that ""snout"" has unique letters and covers U and T, which are in other possibilities, I\'ll go with ""snout"".\n\nIf the word is ""snout"", we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback that U is absent and T might be present or not.\n\nFor example, if feedback for ""snout"" is S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(✓), then we know the last letter is T, and the fourth letter is not U, so it must be O (from ""snoot"" or ""snood"") or B (from ""snobs"") or P (from ""snoop"") or D (from ""snood"")? But ""snood"" has D at the end.\n\nBut we can then make another guess.\n\nBut since we are at guess 3, we can try.\n\nTo save a guess, we might choose a word that can be the solution.\n\nBut I think ""snout"" is a good choice.\n\nAnother idea: we can guess ""snood"" to test for D and the double O.\n\nBut I think ""snout"" is fine.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""snout"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  \n  This means:  \n  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - N is in the word but **not** in position 4.  \n\n- **Guess 2: snowy** → Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)  \n  This means:  \n  - S is in the word and **correctly placed in position 1**.  \n  - N is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2**.  \n  - O is in the word and **correctly placed in position 3**.  \n  - W and Y are **not** in the word.  \n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word starts with **""SNO""** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed).  \n- The word must end with two unknown letters (positions 4 and 5).  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, E, W, Y (cannot appear in the word).  \n- **Possible letters for positions 4 and 5**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z (since excluded letters are ruled out).  \n- Common 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"" that fit the constraints:  \n  - `snood` (ends with O, D)  \n  - `snoot` (ends with O, T)  \n  - `snoop` (ends with O, P)  \n  - `snout` (ends with U, T)  \n  - `snobs` (ends with B, S) — but note S could be repeated (not confirmed yet).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Since the first three letters are confirmed, focus on guessing the last two positions.  \n- Choose a word that tests new letters and avoids duplicates to simplify feedback (e.g., `snout` has unique letters S,N,O,U,T).  \n- `snout` is a strong candidate because:  \n  - It uses `U` and `T` (common letters not tested yet).  \n  - If correct, it wins. If not, feedback on U and T will help narrow the remaining possibilities (e.g., if U is absent, `snoot` or `snood` become more likely).\n\n<guess>snout</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: snout -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>

- W and Y are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""snout"" -> Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)
This means:
- For ""snout"": positions 1,2,3 are S,N,O which are correct (✓).
- U is not in the word (x).
- T is not in the word (x).

From this, we can consolidate:

The secret word has:
- Positions 1,2,3 must be S, N, O respectively. So the word starts with ""SNO"".
- N is in the word (which we knew) and in position 2 (confirmed).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, E, W, Y, U, T. Also from guess 1, we had N(-) which we now know is at position 2, so no issue.
- Additionally, we know U and T are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is ""SNO"" followed by two more letters, and these two letters cannot be C,R,A,E,W,Y,U,T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Z.

Now, we need 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"" that end with two letters from the available set and are valid English words.

Possible words:

- snood: ends with O and D -> O is already at position 3. We don't know if O can be repeated. D is available.
- snoot: ends with O and T -> but T is excluded! So snoot is impossible because T is not in the word.
- snoop: ends with O and P -> P is available. But uses O twice.
- snout: we guessed and it was wrong, and T is excluded.
- snobs: ends with B and S -> S is at position 1, we don't know if S can be repeated. B is available.
- snogs: ends with G and S -> G available, S repeated. ""Snogs"" is a word (British slang for kissing?).
- snips: but ""snips"" starts with SNI, not SNO.
- sniff: starts with SNI.

So for SNO:
- snood: S,N,O,O,D -> last two: O, D
- snoop: S,N,O,O,P -> last two: O, P
- snobs: S,N,O,B,S -> last two: B, S
- snogs: S,N,O,G,S -> last two: G, S
- Other? snof? not a word.

Additional: snood, snoop, snobs, snogs, and maybe ""snort"" but R is excluded.

Also ""snowl"" not a word.

Another one: ""snook"" -> S,N,O,O,K -> ends with O,K -> K is available.

So ""snook"" is a valid word (a type of fish or in snooker?).

Similarly, ""snoff"" not a word.

So possible solutions:

- snood (O,D)
- snoop (O,P)
- snobs (B,S)
- snogs (G,S)
- snook (O,K)

We need to consider duplicate letters. We have O at position 3. In snood, snoop, snook, there is an O at position 4. We don't know if O can be duplicated because we haven't tested it. Similarly, S can be duplicated in snobs and snogs.

Since we have only one O in previous guesses, if the word has two O's, we wouldn't have known.

Now, for our next guess, we need to choose a word that distinguishes these possibilities.

We are on the fourth guess. We have six guesses total, so we can make an informed guess.

We know the word must be ""SNO"" + two letters from B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,X,Z, and the word must be valid.

Among the possibilities: snood, snoop, snook have O in the fourth position, while snobs and snogs have S in the fifth position.

We can choose to guess one of these words.

If we guess ""snood"" and it's wrong, but we get feedback:

If the word is ""snood"":
- S(✓), N(✓), O(✓), O(? ), D(?)

But if the word has only one O, then the second O in the guess might be marked wrong? Or if there are two O's, it could be correct or misplaced.

But let's simulate for ""snook"" as secret:

If we guess ""snood"":
- Position 1: S = S (✓)
- Position 2: N = N (✓)
- Position 3: O = O (✓)
- Position 4: O: secret has O? In ""snook"", position 4 is O? Yes, but we have O at position 3 and 4 in both? In ""snook"", it's S,N,O,O,K? No, ""snook"" is S,N,O,O,K? Wait, no: ""snook"" is spelled S-N-O-O-K? I think it's S-N-O-O-K, so positions: 1:S, 2:N, 3:O, 4:O, 5:K.

Similarly, ""snood"" is S,N,O,O,D -> positions:1:S,2:N,3:O,4:O,5:D.

So if secret is ""snook"" and guess is ""snood"":
- Position 1: S(✓)
- Position 2: N(✓)
- Position 3: O(✓)
- Position 4: O(✓) because both have O at 4.
- Position 5: D vs K: if D is not K and D not in secret? Then D(x)

But if secret is ""snoop"", which is S,N,O,O,P:

Guess ""snood"": 
- Position 1-3: ✓
- Position 4: O=O (✓)
- Position 5: D vs P: D not P and not in secret? Then D(x)

Similarly, if secret is ""snobs"": S,N,O,B,S

Guess ""snood"":
- Position 1: S(✓)
- Position 2: N(✓)
- Position 3: O(✓)
- Position 4: O: secret has B, and O is present? But secret has O at position 3. So O is in the word at position 3, and we already matched it. Since we have another O at position 4 in the guess, but secret has only one O? So the O at position 4 should be marked as absent? But O is in the word, just not at position 4 and we've used the only O? So it should be x.

Standard rule: for duplicate letters in the guess, if the secret has fewer, then the unmatched are marked x.

So for ""snood"" vs ""snobs"":
- Position 4: O: not in the secret at that position, and since the only O is at position 3 and matched, this O is extra -> x
- Position 5: D: secret has S, D is not in the word -> x

So feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) O(x) D(x)

Similarly, if we guess ""snood"" and the secret is ""snobs"", we get O(x) for fourth position.

But if the secret is ""snood"", we get both O and D correct or not?

In ""snood"", position 4 is O and position 5 is D, so if secret is ""snood"", guess ""snood"" would be all correct.

To distinguish, we can choose ""snood"" as a guess.

But we have only three guesses left? No, we have guesses: we are on the fourth guess (since we had three previous).

Guesses used: 1,2,3. Now making the fourth.

If we guess ""snood"", and:
- If all ✓, we win.
- If we get O(x) for position, then it means the word does not have O at position 4, so it must be one of snobs or snogs (which don't have O at 4).

snobs: S,N,O,B,S
snogs: S,N,O,G,S

Both have S at the end.

Similarly, if we get O(✓) and D(-) or something? But D is at position 5.

Since position 3 is O, if we have O at position 4, it might be ✓ if present.

But in the feedback for our guess, we will see.

We can also choose to guess ""snobs"" to test.

Since ""snobs"" ends with S, if the S is at position 5, we get ✓.

But let's choose ""snood"" because it tests for the double O.

I think that's a sensible choice.

Alternatively, we can list the possibilities and see if there's a word that can cover more.

But the possibilities are limited and we can handle them.

So guess ""snood"".

But note: we have excluded T, so snoot is impossible.

Also, snoop, snook, etc., are possible.

In our next guess, we'll get feedback.

So I'll go with ""snood"".

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Review Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1: crane → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)**  
     - Letters `C`, `R`, `A`, `E` are **not** in the secret word.  
     - `N` is in the secret word but **not** in position 4.  
   - **Guess 2: snowy → S(✓), N(✓), O(✓), W(x), Y(x)**  
     - `S` is correctly placed in position 1.  
     - `N` is correctly placed in position 2.  
     - `O` is correctly placed in position 3.  
     - `W` and `Y` are **not** in the secret word.  
   - **Guess 3: snout → S(✓), N(✓), O(✓), U(x), T(x)**  
     - `S`, `N`, `O` are confirmed in positions 1, 2, and 3 (so the secret word starts with ""SNO"").  
     - `U` and `T` are **not** in the secret word.  
   
2. **Consolidate Known Information:**  
   - The secret word is **5 letters** and starts with **""SNO""** (positions 1-3 fixed).  
   - **Excluded letters**: `C`, `R`, `A`, `E`, `W`, `Y`, `U`, `T` (absent based on feedback).  
   - **Remaining possible letters** for positions 4 and 5: `B`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `J`, `K`, `L`, `M`, `P`, `Q`, `V`, `X`, `Z` + `D` (from ""snood"", etc.), and `S` could potentially repeat (though unconfirmed).  
   - **Valid words** starting with ""SNO"" that fit the constraints must avoid excluded letters:  
     - `snood` (ends with `O`, `D`),  
     - `snoop` (ends with `O`, `P`),  
     - `snook` (ends with `O`, `K`),  
     - `snobs` (ends with `B`, `S`),  
     - `snogs` (ends with `G`, `S`).  
   - **Duplicates are possible**: In previous guesses, we haven't tested repeated `O` or `S` (e.g., `snood` has `O` in position 4; `snobs` has `S` in position 5).  

3. **Strategy for Guess 4:**  
   - Focus on **testing position 4 and 5** while maximizing information.  
   - Choose a word that can:  
     - Confirm/eliminate the presence of `O` in position 4 (common in `snood`, `snoop`, `snook`).  
     - Test new common letters like `D` or `P` to narrow possibilities.  
   - `snood` is a strong candidate because:  
     - It tests for `O` in position 4 and `D` in position 5.  
     - If `O` gets ✓ in position 4, it supports double-`O` words (like `snood`, `snoop`, `snook`). If `O` is x or -, it rules these out, pointing to `snobs`/`snogs`.  
     - `D` is an untested letter—feedback on it will help regardless.  
   - Avoid words like `snout` (already guessed) or others with excluded letters.  

4. **Expected Outcomes:**  
   - If `snood` is correct, we win with all ✓.  
   - If not:  
     - ✓✓✓ + `O`(?) + `D`(?) will reveal if `O` can be repeated and if `D` is present/absent.  
     - This immediately narrows the list (e.g., `O`(x) in position 4 suggests prioritizing `snobs`/`snogs`).  

Given the above, **`snood`** is the best guess for efficiency and information gain.

<guess>snood</guess>",snood,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
This means:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""snowy"" -> Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)
This means:
- S is correct and in position 1.
- N is correct and in position 2.
- O is correct and in position 3.
- W and Y are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""snout"" -> Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)
This means:
- For ""snout"": positions 1,2,3 are S,N,O which are correct (✓).
- U is not in the word (x).
- T is not in the word (x).

From this, we can consolidate:

The secret word has:
- Positions 1,2,3 must be S, N, O respectively. So the word starts with ""SNO"".
- N is in the word (which we knew) and in position 2 (confirmed).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, E, W, Y, U, T. Also from guess 1, we had N(-) which we now know is at position 2, so no issue.
- Additionally, we know U and T are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is ""SNO"" followed by two more letters, and these two letters cannot be C,R,A,E,W,Y,U,T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Z.

Now, we need 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"" that end with two letters from the available set and are valid English words.

Possible words:

- snood: ends with O and D -> O is already at position 3. We don't know if O can be repeated. D is available.
- snoot: ends with O and T -> but T is excluded! So snoot is impossible because T is not in the word.
- snoop: ends with O and P -> P is available. But uses O twice.
- snout: we guessed and it was wrong, and T is excluded.
- snobs: ends with B and S -> S is at position 1, we don't know if S can be repeated. B is available.
- snogs: ends with G and S -> G available, S repeated. ""Snogs"" is a word (British slang for kissing?).
- snips: but ""snips"" starts with SNI, not SNO.
- sniff: starts with SNI.

So for SNO:
- snood: S,N,O,O,D -> last two: O, D
- snoop: S,N,O,O,P -> last two: O, P
- snobs: S,N,O,B,S -> last two: B, S
- snogs: S,N,O,G,S -> last two: G, S
- Other? snof? not a word.

Additional: snood, snoop, snobs, snogs, and maybe ""snort"" but R is excluded.

Also ""snowl"" not a word.

Another one: ""snook"" -> S,N,O,O,K -> ends with O,K -> K is available.

So ""snook"" is a valid word (a type of fish or in snooker?).

Similarly, ""snoff"" not a word.

So possible solutions:

- snood (O,D)
- snoop (O,P)
- snobs (B,S)
- snogs (G,S)
- snook (O,K)

We need to consider duplicate letters. We have O at position 3. In snood, snoop, snook, there is an O at position 4. We don't know if O can be duplicated because we haven't tested it. Similarly, S can be duplicated in snobs and snogs.

Since we have only one O in previous guesses, if the word has two O's, we wouldn't have known.

Now, for our next guess, we need to choose a word that distinguishes these possibilities.

We are on the fourth guess. We have six guesses total, so we can make an informed guess.

We know the word must be ""SNO"" + two letters from B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,X,Z, and the word must be valid.

Among the possibilities: snood, snoop, snook have O in the fourth position, while snobs and snogs have S in the fifth position.

We can choose to guess one of these words.

If we guess ""snood"" and it's wrong, but we get feedback:

If the word is ""snood"":
- S(✓), N(✓), O(✓), O(? ), D(?)

But if the word has only one O, then the second O in the guess might be marked wrong? Or if there are two O's, it could be correct or misplaced.

But let's simulate for ""snook"" as secret:

If we guess ""snood"":
- Position 1: S = S (✓)
- Position 2: N = N (✓)
- Position 3: O = O (✓)
- Position 4: O: secret has O? In ""snook"", position 4 is O? Yes, but we have O at position 3 and 4 in both? In ""snook"", it's S,N,O,O,K? No, ""snook"" is S,N,O,O,K? Wait, no: ""snook"" is spelled S-N-O-O-K? I think it's S-N-O-O-K, so positions: 1:S, 2:N, 3:O, 4:O, 5:K.

Similarly, ""snood"" is S,N,O,O,D -> positions:1:S,2:N,3:O,4:O,5:D.

So if secret is ""snook"" and guess is ""snood"":
- Position 1: S(✓)
- Position 2: N(✓)
- Position 3: O(✓)
- Position 4: O(✓) because both have O at 4.
- Position 5: D vs K: if D is not K and D not in secret? Then D(x)

But if secret is ""snoop"", which is S,N,O,O,P:

Guess ""snood"": 
- Position 1-3: ✓
- Position 4: O=O (✓)
- Position 5: D vs P: D not P and not in secret? Then D(x)

Similarly, if secret is ""snobs"": S,N,O,B,S

Guess ""snood"":
- Position 1: S(✓)
- Position 2: N(✓)
- Position 3: O(✓)
- Position 4: O: secret has B, and O is present? But secret has O at position 3. So O is in the word at position 3, and we already matched it. Since we have another O at position 4 in the guess, but secret has only one O? So the O at position 4 should be marked as absent? But O is in the word, just not at position 4 and we've used the only O? So it should be x.

Standard rule: for duplicate letters in the guess, if the secret has fewer, then the unmatched are marked x.

So for ""snood"" vs ""snobs"":
- Position 4: O: not in the secret at that position, and since the only O is at position 3 and matched, this O is extra -> x
- Position 5: D: secret has S, D is not in the word -> x

So feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) O(x) D(x)

Similarly, if we guess ""snood"" and the secret is ""snobs"", we get O(x) for fourth position.

But if the secret is ""snood"", we get both O and D correct or not?

In ""snood"", position 4 is O and position 5 is D, so if secret is ""snood"", guess ""snood"" would be all correct.

To distinguish, we can choose ""snood"" as a guess.

But we have only three guesses left? No, we have guesses: we are on the fourth guess (since we had three previous).

Guesses used: 1,2,3. Now making the fourth.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜> tags. Then, return your guessed word...""

Since this is the first guess, I should think about why I'm choosing this word as my step-by-step process.

So, my thought process:

1. This is the first guess; there's no prior feedback, so I need to choose a word that helps eliminate many possibilities.

2. I should select a word with common letters to increase the chance of getting some in the secret word.

3. ""CRANE"" is a good choice because it has three different vowels (A and E) and common consonants like C, R, N.

4. Also, no repeated letters, so it tests five distinct letters.

5. This will provide feedback on which letters are present and their positions, helping me narrow down for subsequent guesses.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

Finally, output the guess as

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
N(-) -> N is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter 'N', but not at the position we guessed (which was the 4th letter).
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.

Therefore, we must avoid using C, R, A, E in our next guess. Also, we know that the word has an 'N' but not in the 4th position.

For our next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.
- Contains the letter 'N' (but not in the 4th position).
- We might also want to include other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of common 5-letter words without C, R, A, E and that have an 'N' not in the 4th position.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word has at least one 'N'. Since 'N' is not in the 4th position, we can try placing it in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's try to come up with a word that has 'N' and uses other common letters. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, etc.

Possible words:
- We could try ""saint"": but note that we have A and we know A is not in the word -> so invalid because A is excluded.
- ""point"": P, O, I, N, T. This word doesn't have any of the excluded letters. And we can put 'N' in the 4th position? Wait, but in the feedback we were told that 'N' is not in the 4th position. So we must avoid putting 'N' in the 4th position. In ""point"", N is in the 4th position -> so we cannot use that because we know N is not in the 4th.

We need a word that has 'N' but not in the 4th. So positions for N: 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's try:
- ""linen"": L, I, N, E, N -> but E is excluded, so no.
- ""minis"": M, I, N, I, S -> but we don't know if E is excluded? Actually, E is excluded, but this word doesn't have E. However, we have two I's and two S? But that's okay. But note: we have N in the 3rd position (which is not 4th) so that's acceptable. But let's check the letters: M, I, N, I, S. None of these are C, R, A, E. So it's valid.

But maybe we can do better? We want to cover more common letters.

Another idea: ""tonic"" -> T, O, N, I, C. But C is excluded -> invalid.

""doing"": D, O, I, N, G -> N is in the 4th position? We must avoid 4th. So no.

""joint"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th -> avoid.

""mount"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th -> avoid.

""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> N is in the 1st position (not 4th) and the letters are N, I, G, H, T. None of these are excluded. So this is a candidate.

""might"": M, I, G, H, T -> but no N? We need to include N because we know the word has an N. So we must have N.

""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> N in 1st and 3rd. The 3rd is not 4th. So that's okay. But we have two N's? That's acceptable. Letters: N, I, N, T, H -> no excluded letters.

But we might get more information by using a word with more new letters.

Another candidate: ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position (not 4th). And letters: S, N, O, W, Y -> all new and not excluded.

But note: we don't know if the word has more than one N? But we only know of one N so far. However, the word might have two N's? We don't know.

Alternatively, ""downs"": D, O, W, N, S -> N is in the 4th position? We must avoid 4th -> so no.

""pints"": P, I, N, T, S -> N in the 3rd -> okay. But we have T and S which are common.

But let's consider: we have only 6 tries. We want to maximize information.

Another idea: ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> N in the 4th -> avoid.

""slung"": S, L, U, N, G -> N in the 4th -> avoid.

""singe"": but E is excluded -> invalid.

""minks"": M, I, N, K, S -> N in the 3rd -> okay. Letters: M, I, N, K, S -> all new and not excluded.

""lynch"": L, Y, N, C, H -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

So let's choose between:
- ""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> positions: N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)
- ""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> positions: N(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), H(5) -> but we have two N's. If the secret word has only one N, then we might get confusing feedback? But it's acceptable.
- ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> positions: S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)
- ""minks"": M, I, N, K, S -> positions: M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5)

We know that the secret word has an N, but not in the 4th position. So in ""minks"", N is in the 3rd (which is allowed) and we are testing positions 1,2,3,4,5 with new letters.

But note: in ""minks"", we are putting N in the 3rd. We don't know if that's correct or not, but we are trying to get more information.

Alternatively, we might avoid putting N in the 3rd if we think it might be in another position? But we have no information about other positions.

I think ""minks"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we are testing N in the 3rd position. Also, we are introducing M, I, K, S (and we already know N is present).

But we also have the option ""snowy"": which has N in the 2nd position. That might be better because we haven't tested the 2nd position with N? Actually, in the first guess we didn't have N in the 2nd because ""crane"" had N in the 4th.

We can choose either. Let me pick ""snowy"" because it has more vowels? Actually, it has O and Y (which is sometimes a vowel). But we don't know if O is in the word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in a different position than we tried in the first guess (which was 4th) and also covers more common consonants.

I think ""minks"" is a good candidate because it has M, I, N, K, S. We are testing five new letters and one known (N). But note: we are using the known N in the 3rd position.

Another candidate: ""bongs"" -> B, O, N, G, S -> but N is in the 3rd? Actually, that's the same as 3rd. And we don't know if O is excluded? But we haven't been told O is excluded. However, we don't have any feedback on O. But wait, we haven't tried O. So it's okay.

But let's stick to words without the excluded letters: C, R, A, E.

I think ""minks"" is a valid and good choice.

But let me check if there's a word that has N in the 1st or 5th? Because we haven't tested those positions for N.

For example, ""nobly"": N, O, B, L, Y -> N in the 1st. Letters: N, O, B, L, Y -> all new. This is a good candidate.

""nymph"": N, Y, M, P, H -> N in the 1st. Also good.

But ""nymph"" might be less common? We want a common word.

""nobly"" is acceptable.

So now we have:
- ""nobly"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), Y(5)
- ""night"": N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)
- ""snowy"": S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)
- ""minks"": M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5)

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test. All these words have 5 new letters (since we only know N is present, but we haven't tested any of these letters).

But note: we are also testing the position of N. We know N is not in the 4th, so we are avoiding that.

I think ""nobly"" is a good choice because it tests N in the 1st position, which we haven't tried. Also, it uses common letters? B, L, Y are common.

Alternatively, ""snowy"" tests N in the 2nd.

But let's consider: we have limited tries. We want to get as much information as possible.

Another idea: we could use a word that has two N's? But we don't know if there are two. But if we use two N's, we can check if there are two. For example, ""ninja"": N, I, N, J, A -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

""ninny"": N, I, N, N, Y -> but we have two N's? And Y. But we don't know about I and Y. However, we have two new letters: I and Y. But we are repeating N. Also, the word ""ninny"" might not be very common.

I think it's better to use a word with one N and four new letters.

I'll go with ""nobly"" because it tests N in the first position and introduces O, B, L, Y.

But wait, we have already excluded A, E, R, C. We are testing O, B, L, Y.

Alternatively, we could use ""snowy"" to test S, O, W, Y and N in the second position.

I think both are acceptable. Let me choose ""snowy"" because it has more vowels? (O and Y). But Y is not always a vowel.

Alternatively, we can choose ""point"" but we cannot because N is in the 4th -> excluded.

I think I'll go with ""snowy"".

But wait, in ""snowy"", we are putting N in the 2nd position. We don't know if that's correct. But that's the point of guessing.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put N in the 3rd or 4th? We have ""snowy"" (N in 2nd) and ""nobly"" (N in 1st) and ""downy"" -> but D, O, W, N, Y -> N in the 4th -> avoid.

""tinny"": T, I, N, N, Y -> N in the 3rd and 4th? We have to avoid 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. So ""tinny"" has N in the 3rd and 4th -> we are putting N in the 4th which we know is wrong -> so it's a waste. We should avoid.

So between ""nobly"" and ""snowy"", I think ""snowy"" is a bit more common? But both are valid.

I'll choose ""snowy"".

But let me check: we are going to guess ""snowy"".

If the secret word has N in the 2nd position, we'll get a check. Otherwise, we might get a dash or nothing.

Also, we are testing S, O, W, Y.

But note: we are not using the fact that we know N is in the word? We are including N, so that's good.

Alternatively, we could avoid putting N in a position we think might be wrong? But we don't have information.

I think it's fine.

So my next guess: ""snowy""

But wait, what if the secret word has two N's? We don't know. But we are only putting one N. That's okay because we are testing one position.

We can also consider ""minks"" again. I think ""minks"" is also good.

But let me see: we have 6 tries. We are on the second guess. We can choose any.

I'll go with ""snowy"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.
- N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position.

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, E.
- Include N, but not in the 4th position (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").
- Test new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, T, O, L, I, etc.).
- Prioritize words with N in a different position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th) to narrow down its location.

After evaluating options:
- ""snowy"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits the criteria: 
  - Contains N in the 2nd position (not 4th).
  - Uses new letters (S, O, W, Y) not ruled out by previous feedback.
  - Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, E).

This guess will help test:
- If N is correctly placed in the 2nd position (✓).
- If S, O, W, or Y are present and in the right positions (✓), wrong positions (-), or absent (x).

<guess>snowy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
This means:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in the 4th position.

Guess 2: ""snowy"" -> Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)
This means:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- W is not in the word.
- Y is not in the word.

So, from the second guess, we know:
- The first three letters of the secret word are S, N, O. That is, the word starts with ""SNO"".
- W and Y are not in the word.

Additionally, from the first guess, we know:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word.
- N is in the word (which we now know is at position 2).

Now, the secret word is ""SNO"" followed by two more letters. We need to find the last two letters.

We know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, W, Y.

Also, we know that the word must have exactly 5 letters, and we have the first three.

So the word is ""SNO"" + two letters.

We need to choose a word that starts with ""SNO"" and the last two letters are from the remaining alphabet, excluding the known absent letters.

Known absent letters: C, R, A, E, W, Y.

The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z.

But note: we also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Common words that start with ""SNO"":

- snob
- snog
- snob -> but that would be 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words starting with ""SNO"":

- snobs (but S is already at the end? No, we need the word to be 5 letters and start with SNO, so the next two letters.

Let's list 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"":

- snood
- snoot
- snoop
- snout
- snows (but W is absent, so no)
- snobs (but B is possible, and S at the end? But we have to check the letters)

But note: we have feedback that W and Y are absent, so words containing W or Y are invalid.

So:

- snood: S,N,O,O,D -> but we have two O's? The feedback for O in ""snowy"" was O(✓) in position 3, so O is correct at position 3. But the word can have another O? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicate letters. However, in ""snowy"", there was only one O, so we don't know if the word has more than one O. But it's possible.

But let's check the feedback: in ""snowy"", O was in position 3 and marked correct. That doesn't prevent the word from having another O.

But we don't have any information about other positions for O.

Similarly, for N, we have it in position 2 and correct, but it might appear again? But we don't know.

However, in our case, we are looking for words starting with ""SNO"", so the first three are fixed.

Now, the last two letters:

We must avoid C, R, A, E, W, Y.

Possible words:

- snood: letters S,N,O,O,D -> the last two are O and D. But O is already in the word? We don't know if it can be repeated. Also, D is allowed.

- snoot: S,N,O,O,T -> last two O and T.

- snoop: S,N,O,O,P -> last two O and P.

- snout: S,N,O,U,T -> last two U and T.

- snobs: S,N,O,B,S -> but this has two S's? The first S is at position 1, and if we have S at the end, that would be the 5th letter. But we don't know if S can be repeated. Also, in ""snowy"", S was at position 1 and correct, but that doesn't tell us about other S's.

However, we have to consider that the feedback for ""snowy"" only said S(✓) for position 1, but if the word had another S, it might have been indicated? Not necessarily, because in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky. But in this case, since we only have one S in ""snowy"", if the secret word has two S's, we might not know.

But let's recall the rules: for a given guess, if a letter is in the word and in the correct position, it gets a ✓. If it's in the word but in the wrong position, it gets a -. If it's not in the word, it gets an x.

In ""snowy"", we have S at position 1: ✓, meaning the secret word has S at position 1. If the secret word had another S, say at position 5, then in the guess ""snowy"", we don't have an S at position 5, so we wouldn't get any additional feedback for that. So we don't know if there is a second S.

Similarly for O: we have O at position 3: ✓, but there might be another O.

But in our current guess, we are going to make a word starting with ""SNO"", so we are using S, N, O in the first three positions.

Now, for the next guess, we want to find out the last two letters.

We have several possibilities: snood, snoot, snoop, snout, etc.

But we also have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, W, Y.

So:

- snood: uses D. D is not excluded.
- snoot: uses T. T is not excluded.
- snoop: uses P. P is not excluded.
- snout: uses U and T. U and T are not excluded.

But note: we don't know if these words are valid, but they are.

We need to choose one that can give us good information.

Since we have multiple options, we might want to choose a word that has letters that are more common or that can help distinguish.

But note: we are only on the third guess, and we already have the first three letters fixed. So we are really only guessing the last two.

We can try to guess one of these words.

But let's see: if we guess ""snoot"", for example, and if it's not correct, we get feedback on the last two letters.

Similarly for others.

But we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, ""snood"" has two O's.

In the feedback for ""snowy"", we had O only at position 3, so if the word has another O, we don't know.

Similarly, for ""snobs"", it has two S's.

But ""snobs"" ends with S, and we don't know if S is repeated.

However, we can avoid words with repeated letters for now to reduce complexity? Or not.

But let's list all possible 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"" without the excluded letters.

Excluded: C, R, A, E, W, Y.

Possible words:

- snood (S,N,O,O,D)
- snoot (S,N,O,O,T)
- snoop (S,N,O,O,P)
- snout (S,N,O,U,T)
- snobs (S,N,O,B,S) -> but this has two S's, and B.

Also, are there others?

- snogs (S,N,O,G,S) -> but G is allowed, and two S's? But we have to avoid S at the end? No, we don't know.

""snogs"" is a word? It might be less common.

- snips? But that starts with SNI, not SNO.

We are fixed to SNO.

Another one: ""snows"" but W is excluded, so no.

""snort"" but R is excluded.

So the main ones are: snood, snoot, snoop, snout, and perhaps snobs.

Now, we need to choose one to guess.

We can choose ""snout"" because it has U and T, which are less common? Or we can choose one that uses letters we haven't encountered.

But we haven't encountered any of these letters except S,N,O.

We might want to test letters that are in multiple possibilities.

For example, if we guess ""snoot"", we are testing O at position 4 and T at position 5.

But if the word is ""snout"", then we would get O in the wrong position? Let's simulate.

If the secret word is ""snout"":

Our guess ""snoot"": 
- S: position 1, correct -> ✓
- N: position 2, correct -> ✓
- O: position 3, correct -> ✓
- O: position 4, but in ""snout"", the 4th letter is U, not O. And there is no second O? So the O at position 4 is not in the word? But wait, ""snout"" has only one O at position 3. So the second O in ""snoot"" is not in the word? Or is it?

In ""snout"", there is only one O. So for the guess ""snoot"", the first O (position 3) is correct. The second O (position 4) is not in the word because there is only one O. So it would be marked as x? Or -? 

According to the rules: if the letter is not in the word, it's x. But O is in the word, but we already used it once? In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times in the guess but only once in the secret, then the first occurrence (or the one that can be matched) gets the feedback, and the extra one might be marked as x.

Specifically, for ""snoot"" vs ""snout"":
- Position 1: S = S -> ✓
- Position 2: N = N -> ✓
- Position 3: O = O -> ✓
- Position 4: O: but secret has U, and there is no second O, so O is not in the word at position 4? But O is in the word, but at position 3. Since we already matched that O, the second O in the guess is extra and not present, so it should be x.

Similarly, position 5: T = T -> ✓, because ""snout"" has T at position 5.

So feedback would be: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) O(x) T(✓)

But we know the word is ""snout"", so the last two are U and T, but in ""snoot"" we have O and T, so O is wrong and T is correct.

But we don't know that yet.

To avoid confusion, we might want to guess a word that doesn't have duplicate letters.

For example, ""snout"" has no duplicates: S,N,O,U,T.

Similarly, ""snobs"" has two S's, so duplicates.

""snood"" has two O's.

""snoot"" has two O's.

""snoop"" has two O's.

So the only one without duplicates in this list is ""snout"".

Therefore, to make the feedback clearer, we can guess ""snout"".

If we guess ""snout"", and the word is ""snout"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on U and T.

But there are other possibilities like ""snood"", which has two O's.

But if we guess ""snout"", and the word is ""snood"", then:

Guess: S N O U T
Secret: S N O O D

Feedback:
- S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x) ? 
But for the O: in secret, there are two O's, at positions 3 and 4. In guess, we have O at position 3, which is correct. Then U at position 4: not in the word, so x. T at position 5: secret has D, not T, and T is not in the word? So T(x). But what about the second O in the secret? We didn't guess it, so no feedback.

But we would see that U and T are absent, and we have the first three correct.

Similarly, if the word is ""snoot"", and we guess ""snout"":

Guess: S N O U T
Secret: S N O O T

Feedback:
- S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(✓) 
Because O at position 3 is correct, U is not in the word (secret has O at 4, but we didn't guess O at 4, we guessed U, which is not present), and T at 5 is correct.

So we would know that the last letter is T, but the fourth letter is not U, and since we know it's not U, and we have other options.

But we might be able to deduce.

Since we have limited guesses, and we have the first three, we can try ""snout"" as a guess.

But note: we also have ""snood"" and ""snoot"" as possibilities.

Another word: ""snips"" is not SNO.

Or ""snubs"" but that has U and B, and S at the end, but starts with SNU, not SNO.

We must start with SNO.

So the possibilities are limited.

We can list the possible words:

1. snood
2. snoot
3. snoop
4. snout
5. snobs (if we allow two S's)

But ""snobs"": S,N,O,B,S. The last two are B and S.

Now, if we guess ""snout"", and it's not correct, we get feedback that will help eliminate.

But we are on the third guess, so we can afford to guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a possible solution but tests multiple letters for the last two positions? But that might be overkill since we have only two positions left and few possibilities.

For example, we could guess a word like ""snots"", but that has T and S, and two S's, and W is not allowed? But W is excluded, but T and S are allowed. However, ""snots"" starts with SNO, so it's a possible solution? ""snots"" is S,N,O,T,S. But we have two S's.

But let's not complicate.

I think the best is to guess one of the possible words.

Given that ""snout"" has unique letters and covers U and T, which are in other possibilities, I'll go with ""snout"".

If the word is ""snout"", we win.

If not, we get feedback that U is absent and T might be present or not.

For example, if feedback for ""snout"" is S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(✓), then we know the last letter is T, and the fourth letter is not U, so it must be O (from ""snoot"" or ""snood"") or B (from ""snobs"") or P (from ""snoop"") or D (from ""snood"")? But ""snood"" has D at the end.

But we can then make another guess.

But since we are at guess 3, we can try.

To save a guess, we might choose a word that can be the solution.

But I think ""snout"" is a good choice.

Another idea: we can guess ""snood"" to test for D and the double O.

But I think ""snout"" is fine.

So I'll go with ""snout"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
  This means:  
  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  
  - N is in the word but **not** in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: snowy** → Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)  
  This means:  
  - S is in the word and **correctly placed in position 1**.  
  - N is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2**.  
  - O is in the word and **correctly placed in position 3**.  
  - W and Y are **not** in the word.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **""SNO""** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed).  
- The word must end with two unknown letters (positions 4 and 5).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, E, W, Y (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Possible letters for positions 4 and 5**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z (since excluded letters are ruled out).  
- Common 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"" that fit the constraints:  
  - `snood` (ends with O, D)  
  - `snoot` (ends with O, T)  
  - `snoop` (ends with O, P)  
  - `snout` (ends with U, T)  
  - `snobs` (ends with B, S) — but note S could be repeated (not confirmed yet).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Since the first three letters are confirmed, focus on guessing the last two positions.  
- Choose a word that tests new letters and avoids duplicates to simplify feedback (e.g., `snout` has unique letters S,N,O,U,T).  
- `snout` is a strong candidate because:  
  - It uses `U` and `T` (common letters not tested yet).  
  - If correct, it wins. If not, feedback on U and T will help narrow the remaining possibilities (e.g., if U is absent, `snoot` or `snood` become more likely).

- For ""snout"": positions 1,2,3 are S,N,O which are correct (✓).
- U is not in the word (x).
- T is not in the word (x).

From this, we can consolidate:

The secret word has:
- Positions 1,2,3 must be S, N, O respectively. So the word starts with ""SNO"".
- N is in the word (which we knew) and in position 2 (confirmed).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, E, W, Y, U, T. Also from guess 1, we had N(-) which we now know is at position 2, so no issue.
- Additionally, we know U and T are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is ""SNO"" followed by two more letters, and these two letters cannot be C,R,A,E,W,Y,U,T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Z.

Now, we need 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"" that end with two letters from the available set and are valid English words.

Possible words:

- snood: ends with O and D -> O is already at position 3. We don't know if O can be repeated. D is available.
- snoot: ends with O and T -> but T is excluded! So snoot is impossible because T is not in the word.
- snoop: ends with O and P -> P is available. But uses O twice.
- snout: we guessed and it was wrong, and T is excluded.
- snobs: ends with B and S -> S is at position 1, we don't know if S can be repeated. B is available.
- snogs: ends with G and S -> G available, S repeated. ""Snogs"" is a word (British slang for kissing?).
- snips: but ""snips"" starts with SNI, not SNO.
- sniff: starts with SNI.

So for SNO:
- snood: S,N,O,O,D -> last two: O, D
- snoop: S,N,O,O,P -> last two: O, P
- snobs: S,N,O,B,S -> last two: B, S
- snogs: S,N,O,G,S -> last two: G, S
- Other? snof? not a word.

Additional: snood, snoop, snobs, snogs, and maybe ""snort"" but R is excluded.

Also ""snowl"" not a word.

Another one: ""snook"" -> S,N,O,O,K -> ends with O,K -> K is available.

So ""snook"" is a valid word (a type of fish or in snooker?).

Similarly, ""snoff"" not a word.

So possible solutions:

- snood (O,D)
- snoop (O,P)
- snobs (B,S)
- snogs (G,S)
- snook (O,K)

We need to consider duplicate letters. We have O at position 3. In snood, snoop, snook, there is an O at position 4. We don't know if O can be duplicated because we haven't tested it. Similarly, S can be duplicated in snobs and snogs.

Since we have only one O in previous guesses, if the word has two O's, we wouldn't have known.

Now, for our next guess, we need to choose a word that distinguishes these possibilities.

We are on the fourth guess. We have six guesses total, so we can make an informed guess.

We know the word must be ""SNO"" + two letters from B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,X,Z, and the word must be valid.

Among the possibilities: snood, snoop, snook have O in the fourth position, while snobs and snogs have S in the fifth position.

We can choose to guess one of these words.

If we guess ""snood"" and it's wrong, but we get feedback:

If the word is ""snood"":
- S(✓), N(✓), O(✓), O(? ), D(?)

But if the word has only one O, then the second O in the guess might be marked wrong? Or if there are two O's, it could be correct or misplaced.

But let's simulate for ""snook"" as secret:

If we guess ""snood"":
- Position 1: S = S (✓)
- Position 2: N = N (✓)
- Position 3: O = O (✓)
- Position 4: O: secret has O? In ""snook"", position 4 is O? Yes, but we have O at position 3 and 4 in both? In ""snook"", it's S,N,O,O,K? No, ""snook"" is S,N,O,O,K? Wait, no: ""snook"" is spelled S-N-O-O-K? I think it's S-N-O-O-K, so positions: 1:S, 2:N, 3:O, 4:O, 5:K.

Similarly, ""snood"" is S,N,O,O,D -> positions:1:S,2:N,3:O,4:O,5:D.

So if secret is ""snook"" and guess is ""snood"":
- Position 1: S(✓)
- Position 2: N(✓)
- Position 3: O(✓)
- Position 4: O(✓) because both have O at 4.
- Position 5: D vs K: if D is not K and D not in secret? Then D(x)

But if secret is ""snoop"", which is S,N,O,O,P:

Guess ""snood"": 
- Position 1-3: ✓
- Position 4: O=O (✓)
- Position 5: D vs P: D not P and not in secret? Then D(x)

Similarly, if secret is ""snobs"": S,N,O,B,S

Guess ""snood"":
- Position 1: S(✓)
- Position 2: N(✓)
- Position 3: O(✓)
- Position 4: O: secret has B, and O is present? But secret has O at position 3. So O is in the word at position 3, and we already matched it. Since we have another O at position 4 in the guess, but secret has only one O? So the O at position 4 should be marked as absent? But O is in the word, just not at position 4 and we've used the only O? So it should be x.

Standard rule: for duplicate letters in the guess, if the secret has fewer, then the unmatched are marked x.

So for ""snood"" vs ""snobs"":
- Position 4: O: not in the secret at that position, and since the only O is at position 3 and matched, this O is extra -> x
- Position 5: D: secret has S, D is not in the word -> x

So feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) O(x) D(x)

Similarly, if we guess ""snood"" and the secret is ""snobs"", we get O(x) for fourth position.

But if the secret is ""snood"", we get both O and D correct or not?

In ""snood"", position 4 is O and position 5 is D, so if secret is ""snood"", guess ""snood"" would be all correct.

To distinguish, we can choose ""snood"" as a guess.

But we have only three guesses left? No, we have guesses: we are on the fourth guess (since we had three previous).

Guesses used: 1,2,3. Now making the fourth.

If we guess ""snood"", and:
- If all ✓, we win.
- If we get O(x) for position, then it means the word does not have O at position 4, so it must be one of snobs or snogs (which don't have O at 4).

snobs: S,N,O,B,S
snogs: S,N,O,G,S

Both have S at the end.

Similarly, if we get O(✓) and D(-) or something? But D is at position 5.

Since position 3 is O, if we have O at position 4, it might be ✓ if present.

But in the feedback for our guess, we will see.

We can also choose to guess ""snobs"" to test.

Since ""snobs"" ends with S, if the S is at position 5, we get ✓.

But let's choose ""snood"" because it tests for the double O.

I think that's a sensible choice.

Alternatively, we can list the possibilities and see if there's a word that can cover more.

But the possibilities are limited and we can handle them.

So guess ""snood"".

But note: we have excluded T, so snoot is impossible.

Also, snoop, snook, etc., are possible.

In our next guess, we'll get feedback.

So I'll go with ""snood"".### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Review Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1: crane → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)**  
     - Letters `C`, `R`, `A`, `E` are **not** in the secret word.  
     - `N` is in the secret word but **not** in position 4.  
   - **Guess 2: snowy → S(✓), N(✓), O(✓), W(x), Y(x)**  
     - `S` is correctly placed in position 1.  
     - `N` is correctly placed in position 2.  
     - `O` is correctly placed in position 3.  
     - `W` and `Y` are **not** in the secret word.  
   - **Guess 3: snout → S(✓), N(✓), O(✓), U(x), T(x)**  
     - `S`, `N`, `O` are confirmed in positions 1, 2, and 3 (so the secret word starts with ""SNO"").  
     - `U` and `T` are **not** in the secret word.  
   
2. **Consolidate Known Information:**  
   - The secret word is **5 letters** and starts with **""SNO""** (positions 1-3 fixed).  
   - **Excluded letters**: `C`, `R`, `A`, `E`, `W`, `Y`, `U`, `T` (absent based on feedback).  
   - **Remaining possible letters** for positions 4 and 5: `B`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `J`, `K`, `L`, `M`, `P`, `Q`, `V`, `X`, `Z` + `D` (from ""snood"", etc.), and `S` could potentially repeat (though unconfirmed).  
   - **Valid words** starting with ""SNO"" that fit the constraints must avoid excluded letters:  
     - `snood` (ends with `O`, `D`),  
     - `snoop` (ends with `O`, `P`),  
     - `snook` (ends with `O`, `K`),  
     - `snobs` (ends with `B`, `S`),  
     - `snogs` (ends with `G`, `S`).  
   - **Duplicates are possible**: In previous guesses, we haven't tested repeated `O` or `S` (e.g., `snood` has `O` in position 4; `snobs` has `S` in position 5).  

3. **Strategy for Guess 4:**  
   - Focus on **testing position 4 and 5** while maximizing information.  
   - Choose a word that can:  
     - Confirm/eliminate the presence of `O` in position 4 (common in `snood`, `snoop`, `snook`).  
     - Test new common letters like `D` or `P` to narrow possibilities.  
   - `snood` is a strong candidate because:  
     - It tests for `O` in position 4 and `D` in position 5.  
     - If `O` gets ✓ in position 4, it supports double-`O` words (like `snood`, `snoop`, `snook`). If `O` is x or -, it rules these out, pointing to `snobs`/`snogs`.  
     - `D` is an untested letter—feedback on it will help regardless.  
   - Avoid words like `snout` (already guessed) or others with excluded letters.  

4. **Expected Outcomes:**  
   - If `snood` is correct, we win with all ✓.  
   - If not:  
     - ✓✓✓ + `O`(?) + `D`(?) will reveal if `O` can be repeated and if `D` is present/absent.  
     - This immediately narrows the list (e.g., `O`(x) in position 4 suggests prioritizing `snobs`/`snogs`).  

Given the above, **`snood`** is the best guess for efficiency and information gain.

In Wordle strategy, people often start with words that have common letters and avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities.\n\nCommon vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants include S, T, R, N, L, etc. So, I should pick a word with multiple vowels and frequent consonants.\n\nStandard starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. These are often recommended because they contain a good mix of vowels and consonants.\n\nLet me think about ""CRANE"": it has C, R, A, N, E.

Also, we know that the word has an \'N\' but not in the 4th position.\n\nFor our next guess, we should choose a word that:\n- Does not contain C, R, A, E.\n- Contains the letter \'N\' (but not in the 4th position).\n- We might also want to include other common letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think of common 5-letter words without C, R, A, E and that have an \'N\' not in the 4th position.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also know that the word has at least one \'N\'. Since \'N\' is not in the 4th position, we can try placing it in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nLet\'s try to come up with a word that has \'N\' and uses other common letters. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- We could try ""saint"": but note that we have A and we know A is not in the word -> so invalid because A is excluded.\n- ""point"": P, O, I, N, T. This word doesn\'t have any of the excluded letters. And we can put \'N\' in the 4th position? Wait, but in the feedback we were told that \'N\' is not in the 4th position. So we must avoid putting \'N\' in the 4th position. In ""point"", N is in the 4th position -> so we cannot use that because we know N is not in the 4th.\n\nWe need a word that has \'N\' but not in the 4th. So positions for N: 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nLet\'s try:\n- ""linen"": L, I, N, E, N -> but E is excluded, so no.\n- ""minis"": M, I, N, I, S -> but we don\'t know if E is excluded? Actually, E is excluded, but this word doesn\'t have E. However, we have two I\'s and two S? But that\'s okay. But note: we have N in the 3rd position (which is not 4th) so that\'s acceptable. But let\'s check the letters: M, I, N, I, S. None of these are C, R, A, E. So it\'s valid.\n\nBut maybe we can do better? We want to cover more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""tonic"" -> T, O, N, I, C. But C is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""doing"": D, O, I, N, G -> N is in the 4th position? We must avoid 4th. So no.\n\n""joint"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th -> avoid.\n\n""mount"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th -> avoid.\n\n""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> N is in the 1st position (not 4th) and the letters are N, I, G, H, T. None of these are excluded. So this is a candidate.\n\n""might"": M, I, G, H, T -> but no N? We need to include N because we know the word has an N. So we must have N.\n\n""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> N in 1st and 3rd. The 3rd is not 4th. So that\'s okay. But we have two N\'s? That\'s acceptable. Letters: N, I, N, T, H -> no excluded letters.\n\nBut we might get more information by using a word with more new letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position (not 4th). And letters: S, N, O, W, Y -> all new and not excluded.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has more than one N? But we only know of one N so far. However, the word might have two N\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, ""downs"": D, O, W, N, S -> N is in the 4th position? We must avoid 4th -> so no.\n\n""pints"": P, I, N, T, S -> N in the 3rd -> okay. But we have T and S which are common.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we have only 6 tries. We want to maximize information.\n\nAnother idea: ""sting"": S, T, I, N, G -> N in the 4th -> avoid.\n\n""slung"": S, L, U, N, G -> N in the 4th -> avoid.\n\n""singe"": but E is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""minks"": M, I, N, K, S -> N in the 3rd -> okay. Letters: M, I, N, K, S -> all new and not excluded.\n\n""lynch"": L, Y, N, C, H -> but C is excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo let\'s choose between:\n- ""night"": N, I, G, H, T -> positions: N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)\n- ""ninth"": N, I, N, T, H -> positions: N(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), H(5) -> but we have two N\'s. If the secret word has only one N, then we might get confusing feedback? But it\'s acceptable.\n- ""snowy"": S, N, O, W, Y -> positions: S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)\n- ""minks"": M, I, N, K, S -> positions: M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5)\n\nWe know that the secret word has an N, but not in the 4th position. So in ""minks"", N is in the 3rd (which is allowed) and we are testing positions 1,2,3,4,5 with new letters.\n\nBut note: in ""minks"", we are putting N in the 3rd. We don\'t know if that\'s correct or not, but we are trying to get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid putting N in the 3rd if we think it might be in another position? But we have no information about other positions.\n\nI think ""minks"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we are testing N in the 3rd position. Also, we are introducing M, I, K, S (and we already know N is present).\n\nBut we also have the option ""snowy"": which has N in the 2nd position. That might be better because we haven\'t tested the 2nd position with N? Actually, in the first guess we didn\'t have N in the 2nd because ""crane"" had N in the 4th.\n\nWe can choose either. Let me pick ""snowy"" because it has more vowels? Actually, it has O and Y (which is sometimes a vowel). But we don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has N in a different position than we tried in the first guess (which was 4th) and also covers more common consonants.\n\nI think ""minks"" is a good candidate because it has M, I, N, K, S. We are testing five new letters and one known (N). But note: we are using the known N in the 3rd position.\n\nAnother candidate: ""bongs"" -> B, O, N, G, S -> but N is in the 3rd? Actually, that\'s the same as 3rd. And we don\'t know if O is excluded? But we haven\'t been told O is excluded. However, we don\'t have any feedback on O. But wait, we haven\'t tried O. So it\'s okay.\n\nBut let\'s stick to words without the excluded letters: C, R, A, E.\n\nI think ""minks"" is a valid and good choice.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a word that has N in the 1st or 5th? Because we haven\'t tested those positions for N.\n\nFor example, ""nobly"": N, O, B, L, Y -> N in the 1st. Letters: N, O, B, L, Y -> all new. This is a good candidate.\n\n""nymph"": N, Y, M, P, H -> N in the 1st. Also good.\n\nBut ""nymph"" might be less common? We want a common word.\n\n""nobly"" is acceptable.\n\nSo now we have:\n- ""nobly"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), Y(5)\n- ""night"": N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5)\n- ""snowy"": S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5)\n- ""minks"": M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5)\n\nWe want to maximize the number of new letters we test. All these words have 5 new letters (since we only know N is present, but we haven\'t tested any of these letters).\n\nBut note: we are also testing the position of N. We know N is not in the 4th, so we are avoiding that.\n\nI think ""nobly"" is a good choice because it tests N in the 1st position, which we haven\'t tried. Also, it uses common letters? B, L, Y are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""snowy"" tests N in the 2nd.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we have limited tries. We want to get as much information as possible.\n\nAnother idea: we could use a word that has two N\'s? But we don\'t know if there are two. But if we use two N\'s, we can check if there are two. For example, ""ninja"": N, I, N, J, A -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""ninny"": N, I, N, N, Y -> but we have two N\'s? And Y. But we don\'t know about I and Y. However, we have two new letters: I and Y. But we are repeating N. Also, the word ""ninny"" might not be very common.\n\nI think it\'s better to use a word with one N and four new letters.\n\nI\'ll go with ""nobly"" because it tests N in the first position and introduces O, B, L, Y.\n\nBut wait, we have already excluded A, E, R, C. We are testing O, B, L, Y.\n\nAlternatively, we could use ""snowy"" to test S, O, W, Y and N in the second position.\n\nI think both are acceptable. Let me choose ""snowy"" because it has more vowels? (O and Y). But Y is not always a vowel.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""point"" but we cannot because N is in the 4th -> excluded.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""snowy"".\n\nBut wait, in ""snowy"", we are putting N in the 2nd position. We don\'t know if that\'s correct. But that\'s the point of guessing.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put N in the 3rd or 4th? We have ""snowy"" (N in 2nd) and ""nobly"" (N in 1st) and ""downy"" -> but D, O, W, N, Y -> N in the 4th -> avoid.\n\n""tinny"": T, I, N, N, Y -> N in the 3rd and 4th? We have to avoid 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. So ""tinny"" has N in the 3rd and 4th -> we are putting N in the 4th which we know is wrong -> so it\'s a waste. We should avoid.\n\nSo between ""nobly"" and ""snowy"", I think ""snowy"" is a bit more common? But both are valid.\n\nI\'ll choose ""snowy"".\n\nBut let me check: we are going to guess ""snowy"".\n\nIf the secret word has N in the 2nd position, we\'ll get a check. Otherwise, we might get a dash or nothing.\n\nAlso, we are testing S, O, W, Y.\n\nBut note: we are not using the fact that we know N is in the word? We are including N, so that\'s good.\n\nAlternatively, we could avoid putting N in a position we think might be wrong? But we don\'t have information.\n\nI think it\'s fine.\n\nSo my next guess: ""snowy""\n\nBut wait, what if the secret word has two N\'s? We don\'t know. But we are only putting one N. That\'s okay because we are testing one position.\n\nWe can also consider ""minks"" again. I think ""minks"" is also good.\n\nBut let me see: we have 6 tries. We are on the second guess. We can choose any.\n\nI\'ll go with ""snowy"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, E are not in the secret word.\n- N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid using C, R, A, E.\n- Include N, but not in the 4th position (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").\n- Test new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, T, O, L, I, etc.).\n- Prioritize words with N in a different position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th) to narrow down its location.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""snowy"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits the criteria: \n  - Contains N in the 2nd position (not 4th).\n  - Uses new letters (S, O, W, Y) not ruled out by previous feedback.\n  - Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, E).\n\nThis guess will help test:\n- If N is correctly placed in the 2nd position (✓).\n- If S, O, W, or Y are present and in the right positions (✓), wrong positions (-), or absent (x).\n\n<guess>snowy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nThis means:\n- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.\n- N is in the word but not in the 4th position.\n\nGuess 2: ""snowy"" -> Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)\nThis means:\n- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).\n- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).\n- W is not in the word.\n- Y is not in the word.\n\nSo, from the second guess, we know:\n- The first three letters of the secret word are S, N, O. That is, the word starts with ""SNO"".\n- W and Y are not in the word.\n\nAdditionally, from the first guess, we know:\n- C, R, A, E are not in the word.\n- N is in the word (which we now know is at position 2).\n\nNow, the secret word is ""SNO"" followed by two more letters. We need to find the last two letters.\n\nWe know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, W, Y.\n\nAlso, we know that the word must have exactly 5 letters, and we have the first three.\n\nSo the word is ""SNO"" + two letters.\n\nWe need to choose a word that starts with ""SNO"" and the last two letters are from the remaining alphabet, excluding the known absent letters.\n\nKnown absent letters: C, R, A, E, W, Y.\n\nThe remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z.\n\nBut note: we also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nCommon words that start with ""SNO"":\n\n- snob\n- snog\n- snob -> but that would be 4 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\n5-letter words starting with ""SNO"":\n\n- snobs (but S is already at the end? No, we need the word to be 5 letters and start with SNO, so the next two letters.\n\nLet\'s list 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"":\n\n- snood\n- snoot\n- snoop\n- snout\n- snows (but W is absent, so no)\n- snobs (but B is possible, and S at the end? But we have to check the letters)\n\nBut note: we have feedback that W and Y are absent, so words containing W or Y are invalid.\n\nSo:\n\n- snood: S,N,O,O,D -> but we have two O\'s? The feedback for O in ""snowy"" was O(✓) in position 3, so O is correct at position 3. But the word can have another O? The feedback doesn\'t say anything about duplicate letters. However, in ""snowy"", there was only one O, so we don\'t know if the word has more than one O. But it\'s possible.\n\nBut let\'s check the feedback: in ""snowy"", O was in position 3 and marked correct. That doesn\'t prevent the word from having another O.\n\nBut we don\'t have any information about other positions for O.\n\nSimilarly, for N, we have it in position 2 and correct, but it might appear again? But we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, in our case, we are looking for words starting with ""SNO"", so the first three are fixed.\n\nNow, the last two letters:\n\nWe must avoid C, R, A, E, W, Y.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- snood: letters S,N,O,O,D -> the last two are O and D. But O is already in the word? We don\'t know if it can be repeated. Also, D is allowed.\n\n- snoot: S,N,O,O,T -> last two O and T.\n\n- snoop: S,N,O,O,P -> last two O and P.\n\n- snout: S,N,O,U,T -> last two U and T.\n\n- snobs: S,N,O,B,S -> but this has two S\'s? The first S is at position 1, and if we have S at the end, that would be the 5th letter. But we don\'t know if S can be repeated. Also, in ""snowy"", S was at position 1 and correct, but that doesn\'t tell us about other S\'s.\n\nHowever, we have to consider that the feedback for ""snowy"" only said S(✓) for position 1, but if the word had another S, it might have been indicated? Not necessarily, because in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky. But in this case, since we only have one S in ""snowy"", if the secret word has two S\'s, we might not know.\n\nBut let\'s recall the rules: for a given guess, if a letter is in the word and in the correct position, it gets a ✓. If it\'s in the word but in the wrong position, it gets a -. If it\'s not in the word, it gets an x.\n\nIn ""snowy"", we have S at position 1: ✓, meaning the secret word has S at position 1. If the secret word had another S, say at position 5, then in the guess ""snowy"", we don\'t have an S at position 5, so we wouldn\'t get any additional feedback for that. So we don\'t know if there is a second S.\n\nSimilarly for O: we have O at position 3: ✓, but there might be another O.\n\nBut in our current guess, we are going to make a word starting with ""SNO"", so we are using S, N, O in the first three positions.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we want to find out the last two letters.\n\nWe have several possibilities: snood, snoot, snoop, snout, etc.\n\nBut we also have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, E, W, Y.\n\nSo:\n\n- snood: uses D. D is not excluded.\n- snoot: uses T. T is not excluded.\n- snoop: uses P. P is not excluded.\n- snout: uses U and T. U and T are not excluded.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if these words are valid, but they are.\n\nWe need to choose one that can give us good information.\n\nSince we have multiple options, we might want to choose a word that has letters that are more common or that can help distinguish.\n\nBut note: we are only on the third guess, and we already have the first three letters fixed. So we are really only guessing the last two.\n\nWe can try to guess one of these words.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess ""snoot"", for example, and if it\'s not correct, we get feedback on the last two letters.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, ""snood"" has two O\'s.\n\nIn the feedback for ""snowy"", we had O only at position 3, so if the word has another O, we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, for ""snobs"", it has two S\'s.\n\nBut ""snobs"" ends with S, and we don\'t know if S is repeated.\n\nHowever, we can avoid words with repeated letters for now to reduce complexity? Or not.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"" without the excluded letters.\n\nExcluded: C, R, A, E, W, Y.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- snood (S,N,O,O,D)\n- snoot (S,N,O,O,T)\n- snoop (S,N,O,O,P)\n- snout (S,N,O,U,T)\n- snobs (S,N,O,B,S) -> but this has two S\'s, and B.\n\nAlso, are there others?\n\n- snogs (S,N,O,G,S) -> but G is allowed, and two S\'s? But we have to avoid S at the end? No, we don\'t know.\n\n""snogs"" is a word? It might be less common.\n\n- snips? But that starts with SNI, not SNO.\n\nWe are fixed to SNO.\n\nAnother one: ""snows"" but W is excluded, so no.\n\n""snort"" but R is excluded.\n\nSo the main ones are: snood, snoot, snoop, snout, and perhaps snobs.\n\nNow, we need to choose one to guess.\n\nWe can choose ""snout"" because it has U and T, which are less common? Or we can choose one that uses letters we haven\'t encountered.\n\nBut we haven\'t encountered any of these letters except S,N,O.\n\nWe might want to test letters that are in multiple possibilities.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""snoot"", we are testing O at position 4 and T at position 5.\n\nBut if the word is ""snout"", then we would get O in the wrong position? Let\'s simulate.\n\nIf the secret word is ""snout"":\n\nOur guess ""snoot"": \n- S: position 1, correct -> ✓\n- N: position 2, correct -> ✓\n- O: position 3, correct -> ✓\n- O: position 4, but in ""snout"", the 4th letter is U, not O. And there is no second O? So the O at position 4 is not in the word? But wait, ""snout"" has only one O at position 3. So the second O in ""snoot"" is not in the word? Or is it?\n\nIn ""snout"", there is only one O. So for the guess ""snoot"", the first O (position 3) is correct. The second O (position 4) is not in the word because there is only one O. So it would be marked as x? Or -? \n\nAccording to the rules: if the letter is not in the word, it\'s x. But O is in the word, but we already used it once? In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times in the guess but only once in the secret, then the first occurrence (or the one that can be matched) gets the feedback, and the extra one might be marked as x.\n\nSpecifically, for ""snoot"" vs ""snout"":\n- Position 1: S = S -> ✓\n- Position 2: N = N -> ✓\n- Position 3: O = O -> ✓\n- Position 4: O: but secret has U, and there is no second O, so O is not in the word at position 4? But O is in the word, but at position 3. Since we already matched that O, the second O in the guess is extra and not present, so it should be x.\n\nSimilarly, position 5: T = T -> ✓, because ""snout"" has T at position 5.\n\nSo feedback would be: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) O(x) T(✓)\n\nBut we know the word is ""snout"", so the last two are U and T, but in ""snoot"" we have O and T, so O is wrong and T is correct.\n\nBut we don\'t know that yet.\n\nTo avoid confusion, we might want to guess a word that doesn\'t have duplicate letters.\n\nFor example, ""snout"" has no duplicates: S,N,O,U,T.\n\nSimilarly, ""snobs"" has two S\'s, so duplicates.\n\n""snood"" has two O\'s.\n\n""snoot"" has two O\'s.\n\n""snoop"" has two O\'s.\n\nSo the only one without duplicates in this list is ""snout"".\n\nTherefore, to make the feedback clearer, we can guess ""snout"".\n\nIf we guess ""snout"", and the word is ""snout"", we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on U and T.\n\nBut there are other possibilities like ""snood"", which has two O\'s.\n\nBut if we guess ""snout"", and the word is ""snood"", then:\n\nGuess: S N O U T\nSecret: S N O O D\n\nFeedback:\n- S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x) ? \nBut for the O: in secret, there are two O\'s, at positions 3 and 4. In guess, we have O at position 3, which is correct. Then U at position 4: not in the word, so x. T at position 5: secret has D, not T, and T is not in the word? So T(x). But what about the second O in the secret? We didn\'t guess it, so no feedback.\n\nBut we would see that U and T are absent, and we have the first three correct.\n\nSimilarly, if the word is ""snoot"", and we guess ""snout"":\n\nGuess: S N O U T\nSecret: S N O O T\n\nFeedback:\n- S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(✓) \nBecause O at position 3 is correct, U is not in the word (secret has O at 4, but we didn\'t guess O at 4, we guessed U, which is not present), and T at 5 is correct.\n\nSo we would know that the last letter is T, but the fourth letter is not U, and since we know it\'s not U, and we have other options.\n\nBut we might be able to deduce.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, and we have the first three, we can try ""snout"" as a guess.\n\nBut note: we also have ""snood"" and ""snoot"" as possibilities.\n\nAnother word: ""snips"" is not SNO.\n\nOr ""snubs"" but that has U and B, and S at the end, but starts with SNU, not SNO.\n\nWe must start with SNO.\n\nSo the possibilities are limited.\n\nWe can list the possible words:\n\n1. snood\n2. snoot\n3. snoop\n4. snout\n5. snobs (if we allow two S\'s)\n\nBut ""snobs"": S,N,O,B,S. The last two are B and S.\n\nNow, if we guess ""snout"", and it\'s not correct, we get feedback that will help eliminate.\n\nBut we are on the third guess, so we can afford to guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a possible solution but tests multiple letters for the last two positions? But that might be overkill since we have only two positions left and few possibilities.\n\nFor example, we could guess a word like ""snots"", but that has T and S, and two S\'s, and W is not allowed? But W is excluded, but T and S are allowed. However, ""snots"" starts with SNO, so it\'s a possible solution? ""snots"" is S,N,O,T,S. But we have two S\'s.\n\nBut let\'s not complicate.\n\nI think the best is to guess one of the possible words.\n\nGiven that ""snout"" has unique letters and covers U and T, which are in other possibilities, I\'ll go with ""snout"".\n\nIf the word is ""snout"", we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback that U is absent and T might be present or not.\n\nFor example, if feedback for ""snout"" is S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(✓), then we know the last letter is T, and the fourth letter is not U, so it must be O (from ""snoot"" or ""snood"") or B (from ""snobs"") or P (from ""snoop"") or D (from ""snood"")? But ""snood"" has D at the end.\n\nBut we can then make another guess.\n\nBut since we are at guess 3, we can try.\n\nTo save a guess, we might choose a word that can be the solution.\n\nBut I think ""snout"" is a good choice.\n\nAnother idea: we can guess ""snood"" to test for D and the double O.\n\nBut I think ""snout"" is fine.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""snout"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  \n  This means:  \n  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - N is in the word but **not** in position 4.  \n\n- **Guess 2: snowy** → Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)  \n  This means:  \n  - S is in the word and **correctly placed in position 1**.  \n  - N is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2**.  \n  - O is in the word and **correctly placed in position 3**.  \n  - W and Y are **not** in the word.  \n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word starts with **""SNO""** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed).  \n- The word must end with two unknown letters (positions 4 and 5).  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, E, W, Y (cannot appear in the word).  \n- **Possible letters for positions 4 and 5**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z (since excluded letters are ruled out).  \n- Common 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"" that fit the constraints:  \n  - `snood` (ends with O, D)  \n  - `snoot` (ends with O, T)  \n  - `snoop` (ends with O, P)  \n  - `snout` (ends with U, T)  \n  - `snobs` (ends with B, S) — but note S could be repeated (not confirmed yet).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Since the first three letters are confirmed, focus on guessing the last two positions.  \n- Choose a word that tests new letters and avoids duplicates to simplify feedback (e.g., `snout` has unique letters S,N,O,U,T).  \n- `snout` is a strong candidate because:  \n  - It uses `U` and `T` (common letters not tested yet).  \n  - If correct, it wins. If not, feedback on U and T will help narrow the remaining possibilities (e.g., if U is absent, `snoot` or `snood` become more likely).\n\n<guess>snout</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: snout -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nThis means:\n- C, R, A, E are not in the word.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n\nGuess 2: ""snowy"" -> Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)\nThis means:\n- S is correct and in position 1.\n- N is correct and in position 2.\n- O is correct and in position 3.\n- W and Y are not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: ""snout"" -> Feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)\nThis means:\n- For ""snout"": positions 1,2,3 are S,N,O which are correct (✓).\n- U is not in the word (x).\n- T is not in the word (x).\n\nFrom this, we can consolidate:\n\nThe secret word has:\n- Positions 1,2,3 must be S, N, O respectively. So the word starts with ""SNO"".\n- N is in the word (which we knew) and in position 2 (confirmed).\n- Excluded letters: C, R, A, E, W, Y, U, T. Also from guess 1, we had N(-) which we now know is at position 2, so no issue.\n- Additionally, we know U and T are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is ""SNO"" followed by two more letters, and these two letters cannot be C,R,A,E,W,Y,U,T.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Z.\n\nNow, we need 5-letter words starting with ""SNO"" that end with two letters from the available set and are valid English words.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- snood: ends with O and D -> O is already at position 3. We don\'t know if O can be repeated. D is available.\n- snoot: ends with O and T -> but T is excluded! So snoot is impossible because T is not in the word.\n- snoop: ends with O and P -> P is available. But uses O twice.\n- snout: we guessed and it was wrong, and T is excluded.\n- snobs: ends with B and S -> S is at position 1, we don\'t know if S can be repeated. B is available.\n- snogs: ends with G and S -> G available, S repeated. ""Snogs"" is a word (British slang for kissing?).\n- snips: but ""snips"" starts with SNI, not SNO.\n- sniff: starts with SNI.\n\nSo for SNO:\n- snood: S,N,O,O,D -> last two: O, D\n- snoop: S,N,O,O,P -> last two: O, P\n- snobs: S,N,O,B,S -> last two: B, S\n- snogs: S,N,O,G,S -> last two: G, S\n- Other? snof? not a word.\n\nAdditional: snood, snoop, snobs, snogs, and maybe ""snort"" but R is excluded.\n\nAlso ""snowl"" not a word.\n\nAnother one: ""snook"" -> S,N,O,O,K -> ends with O,K -> K is available.\n\nSo ""snook"" is a valid word (a type of fish or in snooker?).\n\nSimilarly, ""snoff"" not a word.\n\nSo possible solutions:\n\n- snood (O,D)\n- snoop (O,P)\n- snobs (B,S)\n- snogs (G,S)\n- snook (O,K)\n\nWe need to consider duplicate letters. We have O at position 3. In snood, snoop, snook, there is an O at position 4. We don\'t know if O can be duplicated because we haven\'t tested it. Similarly, S can be duplicated in snobs and snogs.\n\nSince we have only one O in previous guesses, if the word has two O\'s, we wouldn\'t have known.\n\nNow, for our next guess, we need to choose a word that distinguishes these possibilities.\n\nWe are on the fourth guess. We have six guesses total, so we can make an informed guess.\n\nWe know the word must be ""SNO"" + two letters from B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,X,Z, and the word must be valid.\n\nAmong the possibilities: snood, snoop, snook have O in the fourth position, while snobs and snogs have S in the fifth position.\n\nWe can choose to guess one of these words.\n\nIf we guess ""snood"" and it\'s wrong, but we get feedback:\n\nIf the word is ""snood"":\n- S(✓), N(✓), O(✓), O(? ), D(?)\n\nBut if the word has only one O, then the second O in the guess might be marked wrong? Or if there are two O\'s, it could be correct or misplaced.\n\nBut let\'s simulate for ""snook"" as secret:\n\nIf we guess ""snood"":\n- Position 1: S = S (✓)\n- Position 2: N = N (✓)\n- Position 3: O = O (✓)\n- Position 4: O: secret has O? In ""snook"", position 4 is O? Yes, but we have O at position 3 and 4 in both? In ""snook"", it\'s S,N,O,O,K? No, ""snook"" is S,N,O,O,K? Wait, no: ""snook"" is spelled S-N-O-O-K? I think it\'s S-N-O-O-K, so positions: 1:S, 2:N, 3:O, 4:O, 5:K.\n\nSimilarly, ""snood"" is S,N,O,O,D -> positions:1:S,2:N,3:O,4:O,5:D.\n\nSo if secret is ""snook"" and guess is ""snood"":\n- Position 1: S(✓)\n- Position 2: N(✓)\n- Position 3: O(✓)\n- Position 4: O(✓) because both have O at 4.\n- Position 5: D vs K: if D is not K and D not in secret? Then D(x)\n\nBut if secret is ""snoop"", which is S,N,O,O,P:\n\nGuess ""snood"": \n- Position 1-3: ✓\n- Position 4: O=O (✓)\n- Position 5: D vs P: D not P and not in secret? Then D(x)\n\nSimilarly, if secret is ""snobs"": S,N,O,B,S\n\nGuess ""snood"":\n- Position 1: S(✓)\n- Position 2: N(✓)\n- Position 3: O(✓)\n- Position 4: O: secret has B, and O is present? But secret has O at position 3. So O is in the word at position 3, and we already matched it. Since we have another O at position 4 in the guess, but secret has only one O? So the O at position 4 should be marked as absent? But O is in the word, just not at position 4 and we\'ve used the only O? So it should be x.\n\nStandard rule: for duplicate letters in the guess, if the secret has fewer, then the unmatched are marked x.\n\nSo for ""snood"" vs ""snobs"":\n- Position 4: O: not in the secret at that position, and since the only O is at position 3 and matched, this O is extra -> x\n- Position 5: D: secret has S, D is not in the word -> x\n\nSo feedback: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) O(x) D(x)\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""snood"" and the secret is ""snobs"", we get O(x) for fourth position.\n\nBut if the secret is ""snood"", we get both O and D correct or not?\n\nIn ""snood"", position 4 is O and position 5 is D, so if secret is ""snood"", guess ""snood"" would be all correct.\n\nTo distinguish, we can choose ""snood"" as a guess.\n\nBut we have only three guesses left?

Now making the fourth.\n\nIf we guess ""snood"", and:\n- If all ✓, we win.\n- If we get O(x) for position, then it means the word does not have O at position 4, so it must be one of snobs or snogs (which don\'t have O at 4).\n\nsnobs: S,N,O,B,S\nsnogs: S,N,O,G,S\n\nBoth have S at the end.\n\nSimilarly, if we get O(✓) and D(-) or something?

If `O` is x or -, it rules these out, pointing to `snobs`/`snogs`.  \n     - `D` is an untested letter—feedback on it will help regardless.  \n   - Avoid words like `snout` (already guessed) or others with excluded letters.  \n\n4. **Expected Outcomes:**  \n   - If `snood` is correct, we win with all ✓.  \n   - If not:  \n     - ✓✓✓ + `O`(?) + `D`(?) will reveal if `O` can be repeated and if `D` is present/absent.  \n     - This immediately narrows the list (e.g., `O`(x) in position 4 suggests prioritizing `snobs`/`snogs`).  \n\nGiven the above, **`snood`** is the best guess for efficiency and information gain.\n\n<guess>snood</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: snout -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)\nGuess 4: snood -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) O(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
- C, R, A, E are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""snowy"" -> S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)
- S is in the word and in position 1.
- N is in the word and in position 2.
- O is in the word and in position 3.
- W and Y are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""snout"" -> S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)
- S, N, O are correct in positions 1,2,3.
- U and T are not in the word.

Guess 4: ""snood"" -> S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) O(✓) D(x)
- S, N, O are correct in positions 1,2,3.
- The second O (in position 4) is correct (✓), meaning the secret word has an O in position 4.
- D is not in the word (x).

Now, consolidating the information:

- The secret word is ""SNO"" in the first three positions. From guess 4, we know that position 4 is also O. So the word is ""SNO O _"" (i.e., starts with ""SNOO"").
- The last letter is the only one missing.

From the feedback:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 2: N (fixed)
- Position 3: O (fixed)
- Position 4: O (fixed) — confirmed by guess 4.

So the word is ""SNOO"" + one more letter.

Now, the last letter must be a letter that forms a valid English word, and it must not be any of the excluded letters.

Excluded letters (from all feedback so far):
- From guess 1: C, R, A, E
- From guess 2: W, Y
- From guess 3: U, T
- From guess 4: D

So excluded: C, R, A, E, W, Y, U, T, D.

Also, we know that the word has at least two O's (positions 3 and 4), but it might have more? But we don't know about the last letter.

Now, the last letter must be from the remaining alphabet: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""SNOO"" and ends with one of these letters.

Possible words:
- ""snoop"" — ends with P. P is not excluded.
- ""snook"" — ends with K. K is not excluded.
- ""snooz"" — not a word, it's ""snooze"" which is 6 letters.
- ""snool"" — not a common word? I think ""snool"" might not be valid.
- ""snoof"" — not a word.
- ""snoom"" — not a word.

Common words:
- ""snoop"": S,N,O,O,P
- ""snook"": S,N,O,O,K

Also, ""snoot"" is not possible because T is excluded.

""snood"" we guessed and D is excluded.

So the only common possibilities are ""snoop"" and ""snook"".

We need to choose between P or K for the last letter.

We can guess either one.

Since we have two options, we can guess ""snoop"" to see.

If we guess ""snoop"", and it's correct, we win.

If not, then it must be ""snook"".

But we have two guesses left (since we are on the fifth guess, and we have six total), so we can do that.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that is not necessarily a candidate but tests the last letter? But that might not be efficient.

Since we only have two possibilities, we can guess one.

I think ""snoop"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with ""snoop"".

But let's confirm: ""snoop"" is S,N,O,O,P.

We know positions 1-4 are S,N,O,O, which are correct. So we are testing if the last letter is P.

If it is, we get all ✓.

If not, then we know it must be ""snook"" (with K).

So we can guess ""snoop"".

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Review Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)**  
     - `C`, `R`, `A`, `E` are **not** in the secret word.  
     - `N` is in the word but **not** in position 4.  
   - **Guess 2: snowy → S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) W(x) Y(x)**  
     - `S` is in position 1, `N` in position 2, and `O` in position 3 (all confirmed).  
     - `W` and `Y` are **not** in the word.  
   - **Guess 3: snout → S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) U(x) T(x)**  
     - `S`, `N`, `O` are reconfirmed in positions 1–3.  
     - `U` and `T` are **not** in the word.  
   - **Guess 4: snood → S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) O(✓) D(x)**  
     - `S`, `N`, `O` (position 3) reconfirmed.  
     - The second `O` (position 4) is **correctly placed** (✓), meaning position 4 is `O`.  
     - `D` is **not** in the word.  

2. **Consolidate Known Information:**  
   - The secret word starts with **""SNOO""** (positions 1–4 confirmed: `S`, `N`, `O`, `O`).  
   - Only **position 5 remains unknown**.  
   - **Excluded letters** (absent from the word): `C`, `R`, `A`, `E`, `W`, `Y`, `U`, `T`, `D` (from feedback).  
   - **Possible letters for position 5**: Remaining letters not excluded: `B`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `J`, `K`, `L`, `M`, `P`, `Q`, `V`, `X`, `Z`.  
   - **Valid 5-letter words starting with ""SNOO""**:  
     - `snoop` (ends with `P`),  
     - `snook` (ends with `K`).  
     - Other combinations (e.g., `snoof`, `snooz`) are invalid words.  

3. **Strategy for Guess 5:**  
   - Only two valid candidates remain: `snoop` and `snook`.  
   - Guess **`snoop`** to test `P` in position 5:  
     - If `snoop` is correct, we win.  
     - If `snoop` gets `P(x)`, the secret word must be `snook` (since `K` is the only other option).  
   - This guess maximizes efficiency (resolves the puzzle in 5–6 guesses).
