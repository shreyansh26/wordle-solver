We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in word games include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common consonants and a vowel, and all letters are distinct.

 So, the first guess is: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, the secret word has:
- 'C' as the first letter (position 1)
- 'N' as the fourth letter (position 4)
- The letters 'R', 'A', and 'E' are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: C _ _ N _

We know that the second, third, and fifth letters must be from the alphabet excluding R, A, E, and also excluding C and N (since they are already placed, but note that if there were duplicates, the feedback might have shown, but in this case, we don't have duplicates in the guess). However, we must be cautious: the feedback only says that R, A, E are absent, so they cannot appear anywhere.

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to choose a second guess that:
- Has 'C' in the first position and 'N' in the fourth position (to confirm or get more information about the other positions).
- Avoids the letters R, A, E (since they are not in the word).
- Tries to include other common letters to get more information.

Possible letters for the remaining positions (2, 3, 5): all letters except R, A, E, and also we know the word has C and N already, but they might appear again? The feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know if duplicates are possible. However, since the feedback for R, A, E was 'x', they are completely absent, so no duplicates of those. For C and N, they are already placed, so if they appear again, we would have seen a '-' for the duplicate in a different position? But in our first guess, we only had one of each.

But note: the feedback for the first guess: 
- C is correct and in position 1, so if there were another C, we would have seen a '-' for it in another position? But we didn't have another C. Similarly for N.

So, we can assume that the word does not have duplicate letters? Not necessarily, but without evidence, we can proceed without duplicates for now.

We need to form a word: C _ _ N _

We must avoid R, A, E.

Let's think of common letters that can fit.

We can try to use a word that has common vowels and consonants in the middle.

Common vowels: O, I, U (since A and E are out)
Common consonants: T, S, L, D, etc.

We can try the word ""CLINT"": 
- C (first) -> we know it's correct, so we can use it to test the other letters.
- L in position 2
- I in position 3
- N (fourth) -> correct
- T in position 5

But is ""CLINT"" a valid word? It might be a name, but we need a common word. Alternatively, we can use ""COINS"", but that doesn't have N in the fourth position.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

Let me think of words that start with C and have N in the fourth position.

Some possibilities:
- CHINS: C H I N S -> but H, I, S are new.
- CLINK: C L I N K -> L, I, K are new.
- COINS: C O I N S -> but the fourth letter is N? Let's check: positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:S -> yes.

But in ""COINS"", the fourth letter is N, which is correct. However, we must avoid the letter S? We don't know if S is in the word or not. We haven't guessed S yet.

But note: we are allowed to use any letters except the ones we know are absent (R, A, E). So S is allowed.

However, we have to consider that the first guess had 'C' and 'N' in the correct positions, so in the second guess, we can keep them and change the others.

But we also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern C _ _ N _ and avoid R, A, E.

Possible words:
- CHINS: letters C, H, I, N, S
- CLINK: C, L, I, N, K
- COINS: C, O, I, N, S
- COWNS: C, O, W, N, S
- DOWNS? But doesn't start with C.

We must start with C and have N at position 4.

Another: ""CROWN"" -> but we have R? We know R is absent, so we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, A, E.

So, let's avoid words with R, A, E.

""CHINS"": H, I, S are new -> valid word.
""CLINK"": L, I, K -> valid.
""COINS"": O, I, S -> valid.
""COWNS"": O, W, S -> valid.

We can also consider ""CHINK"" (but it might be offensive) or ""CLUNG"" (but U and G, and the fourth letter is N? C L U N G -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G -> yes).

But let's choose one that uses common letters to maximize information.

I think ""COINS"" is a good candidate because it uses O, I, S which are common.

Alternatively, ""CLINK"" uses L, I, K.

We might also consider ""CHINS"" or ""COWNS"".

But note: we want to test letters that are likely to be in the word. Since we have two positions to figure out (2, 3, and 5) but actually three positions: 2, 3, and 5.

We can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we have no evidence, so we avoid for now.

Another idea: we can use a word that doesn't necessarily have the known letters if we want to test other letters? But that might not be efficient. Since we know C and N are in the word and in those positions, it's better to keep them to get information about the other positions.

So, we'll keep C at position 1 and N at position 4.

We'll choose a word that has new letters in positions 2, 3, and 5.

Let me choose ""COINS"". It has O, I, S.

So, guess: COINS

But let's check: 
- Position 1: C (should be correct, so we expect ✓ for C)
- Position 2: O (we don't know)
- Position 3: I (we don't know)
- Position 4: N (correct, so ✓)
- Position 5: S (we don't know)

This will tell us if O, I, or S are in the word and in which positions.

Alternatively, ""CLINK"" has L, I, K.

But I think ""COINS"" is more common.

Another common word: ""CHAIN"" -> but A is absent, so we cannot use A.

We must avoid A.

So, ""COINS"" seems good.

But wait, the feedback for the first guess said that R, A, E are absent. So in ""COINS"", we are using O, I, S, which are not forbidden.

So, I'll go with ""COINS"".

But note: the word must be valid. ""COINS"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the second guess is ""COINS"".

But let me think: is there a word that uses more common consonants? Like T? For example, ""COUNT"": C O U N T -> but U and T. However, we don't have U and T.

But ""COUNT"" has U and T, which are new.

But we can also consider ""COILS"": C O I L S -> but the fourth letter is L, not N. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

Another: ""CONUS"" (a geographical term) but not common.

So, I think ""COINS"" is fine.

Alternatively, ""CLINT"" is a name, but we should avoid names? The rules say ""valid 5-letter English word"", so common nouns are better.

Another option: ""CHINS"" is a common word.

But I think ""COINS"" is acceptable.

We can also do ""COWNS"", but ""COINS"" is more common.

I'll go with ""COINS"".

So, the second guess: COINS

But note: we are to return the guess in the specified format.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C(✓) : The first letter is C and in the correct position.

- A(x) : A is not in the secret word.
- N(✓) : The fourth letter is N and in the correct position.
- E(x) : E is not in the secret word.

The secret word has the form: C _ _ N _
- Letters R, A, and E are eliminated.
- The second, third, and fifth positions need to be guessed.

For the second guess:
- Keep C in position 1 and N in position 4 to maintain known correct letters.
- Test new common letters (e.g., O, I, S) in the unknown positions to gather more information.
- Avoid eliminated letters (R, A, E).

The word ""coins"" fits these criteria:
- Starts with C (position 1).
- Ends with N in position 4.
- Uses new letters O, I, S for positions 2, 3, and 5.

But is ""CLINT"" a valid word? It might be a name, but we need a common word. Alternatively, we can use ""COINS"", but that doesn't have N in the fourth position.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

Let me think of words that start with C and have N in the fourth position.

Some possibilities:
- CHINS: C H I N S -> but H, I, S are new.
- CLINK: C L I N K -> L, I, K are new.
- COINS: C O I N S -> but the fourth letter is N? Let's check: positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:S -> yes.

But in ""COINS"", the fourth letter is N, which is correct. However, we must avoid the letter S? We don't know if S is in the word or not. We haven't guessed S yet.

But note: we are allowed to use any letters except the ones we know are absent (R, A, E). So S is allowed.

However, we have to consider that the first guess had 'C' and 'N' in the correct positions, so in the second guess, we can keep them and change the others.

But we also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern C _ _ N _ and avoid R, A, E.

Possible words:
- CHINS: letters C, H, I, N, S
- CLINK: C, L, I, N, K
- COINS: C, O, I, N, S
- COWNS: C, O, W, N, S
- DOWNS? But doesn't start with C.

We must start with C and have N at position 4.

Another: ""CROWN"" -> but we have R? We know R is absent, so we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, A, E.

So, let's avoid words with R, A, E.

""CHINS"": H, I, S are new -> valid word.
""CLINK"": L, I, K -> valid.
""COINS"": O, I, S -> valid.
""COWNS"": O, W, S -> valid.

We can also consider ""CHINK"" (but it might be offensive) or ""CLUNG"" (but U and G, and the fourth letter is N? C L U N G -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G -> yes).

But let's choose one that uses common letters to maximize information.

I think ""COINS"" is a good candidate because it uses O, I, S which are common.

Alternatively, ""CLINK"" uses L, I, K.

We might also consider ""CHINS"" or ""COWNS"".

But note: we want to test letters that are likely to be in the word. Since we have two positions to figure out (2, 3, and 5) but actually three positions: 2, 3, and 5.

We can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we have no evidence, so we avoid for now.

Another idea: we can use a word that doesn't necessarily have the known letters if we want to test other letters? But that might not be efficient. Since we know C and N are in the word and in those positions, it's better to keep them to get information about the other positions.

So, we'll keep C at position 1 and N at position 4.

We'll choose a word that has new letters in positions 2, 3, and 5.

Let me choose ""COINS"". It has O, I, S.

So, guess: COINS

But let's check: 
- Position 1: C (should be correct, so we expect ✓ for C)
- Position 2: O (we don't know)
- Position 3: I (we don't know)
- Position 4: N (correct, so ✓)
- Position 5: S (we don't know)

This will tell us if O, I, or S are in the word and in which positions.

Alternatively, ""CLINK"" has L, I, K.

But I think ""COINS"" is more common.

Another common word: ""CHAIN"" -> but A is absent, so we cannot use A.

We must avoid A.

So, ""COINS"" seems good.

But wait, the feedback for the first guess said that R, A, E are absent. So in ""COINS"", we are using O, I, S, which are not forbidden.

So, I'll go with ""COINS"".

But note: the word must be valid. ""COINS"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the second guess is ""COINS"".

But let me think: is there a word that uses more common consonants? Like T? For example, ""COUNT"": C O U N T -> but U and T. However, we don't have U and T.

But ""COUNT"" has U and T, which are new.

But we can also consider ""COILS"": C O I L S -> but the fourth letter is L, not N. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

Another: ""CONUS"" (a geographical term) but not common.

So, I think ""COINS"" is fine.

Alternatively, ""CLINT"" is a name, but we should avoid names? The rules say ""valid 5-letter English word"", so common nouns are better.

Another option: ""CHINS"" is a common word.

But I think ""COINS"" is acceptable.

We can also do ""COWNS"", but ""COINS"" is more common.

I'll go with ""COINS"".

So, the second guess: COINS

But note: we are to return the guess in the specified format.

So, <guess>coins</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C(✓) : The first letter is C and in the correct position.
- R(x) : R is not in the secret word.
- A(x) : A is not in the secret word.
- N(✓) : The fourth letter is N and in the correct position.
- E(x) : E is not in the secret word.

The secret word has the form: C _ _ N _
- Letters R, A, and E are eliminated.
- The second, third, and fifth positions need to be guessed.

For the second guess:
- Keep C in position 1 and N in position 4 to maintain known correct letters.
- Test new common letters (e.g., O, I, S) in the unknown positions to gather more information.
- Avoid eliminated letters (R, A, E).

The word ""coins"" fits these criteria:
- Starts with C (position 1).
- Ends with N in position 4.
- Uses new letters O, I, S for positions 2, 3, and 5.
- Is a valid English word.

This guess will provide feedback on whether O, I, or S are in the word and their positions.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position, so the first letter is C)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so the fourth letter is N)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, the secret word is of the form: C _ _ N _

Eliminated letters: R, A, E

Guess 2: ""coins""
- C: ✓ (first letter correct, as expected)
- O: x (O is not in the word)
- I: x (I is not in the word)
- N: ✓ (fourth letter correct, as expected)
- S: x (S is not in the word)

So, we now have additional eliminated letters: O, I, S

Total eliminated letters: R, A, E, O, I, S

The secret word is: C _ _ N _

We need to find a word that:
- Starts with C
- Has N as the fourth letter
- The second, third, and fifth letters are from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, N, and the eliminated letters: R, A, E, O, I, S)

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We must form a valid English word of the pattern C _ _ N _

We can list possible words:

- The second letter can be: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- The third letter: same set
- The fifth letter: same set

But we need to form a real word.

Common words that fit:

- ""CHUNK"": C H U N K -> but H, U, K are not eliminated? H is available, U is available, K is available. But let's check: positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:U, 4:N, 5:K -> valid word? Yes, ""chunk"" is a word.

But we have to check if any of these letters are eliminated? H, U, K are not in the eliminated list.

Eliminated: R,A,E,O,I,S. So H, U, K are allowed.

Another possibility: ""CLUNG"": C L U N G -> L, U, G. ""Clung"" is a word.

""CHINK"": C H I N K -> but I is eliminated! We cannot use I because from guess 2, I is not in the word. So ""chink"" is invalid because of I.

Similarly, ""CLINK"" has I, which is eliminated.

""COUNT"": C O U N T -> O is eliminated, so no.

""COWNS"": C O W N S -> O and S are eliminated.

So, back to ""chunk"": C H U N K

Another: ""CHAMP"": but A is eliminated.

""CHUMP"": C H U M P -> H, U, M, P. ""Chump"" is a word.

""CLUMP"": C L U M P -> L, U, M, P.

""THING"": but doesn't start with C.

We need C at start.

""CYTON""? Not common.

""CHUNK"" seems good.

But let's see if there are other options to test more letters.

We have many letters left. We might want to use a word that uses common letters to maximize information.

For example, we can try to include T, L, U, etc.

But note: we have three positions to fill and many letters. We might get it in this guess if we are lucky.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tested to narrow down.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess.

We can try ""CHUNK"" or ""CLUMP"".

But let me think of words with T, since T is a common letter.

For example, ""CUTIN"": but I is eliminated.

""COUNT"": O eliminated.

""CHANT"": A eliminated.

""CLINT"": I eliminated.

So, no T in the pattern? Because T would have to be in position 2, 3, or 5.

For example, ""C_T_N_"" or ""C__TN_"" but we need the fourth to be N.

So, words like ""CUTIN"" (invalid due to I) or ""CATION"" (6 letters, no).

5-letter: ""CABIN"" - A and I eliminated.

No, so T might not be in the word? But we don't know.

We can try a word that has T, for example, ""CUTTY""? But that doesn't have N in the fourth position.

We need the fourth to be N.

Another word: ""COTAN"" - O and A eliminated.

So, perhaps T is not appearing in many words with this pattern? 

Let me list possible words:

- CHUNK: C H U N K
- CLUNK: C L U N K
- CHUMP: C H U M P
- CLUMP: C L U M P
- CHUGS: C H U G S -> but S is eliminated? S is eliminated, so we cannot use S. So ""chugs"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""CHUMS"" has S.

""CHUFF"": C H U F F -> but F is available, and ""chuff"" is a word? Meaning: to produce exhaust fumes. But it might be obscure.

""CLUNG"": C L U N G -> L, U, G. ""Clung"" is the past tense of cling, common.

""FLUNG"" doesn't start with C.

""CYCLIN""? Not 5 letters.

""COYING"" - O and I eliminated.

So, the most common words seem to be ""chunk"", ""clunk"", ""clung"", ""chump"", ""clump"".

We can also consider ""CHINO"" but O and I eliminated.

Another: ""KNOLL"" doesn't start with C.

Perhaps ""CUMIN"" - but U and I? I is eliminated, and also the fourth letter is I, not N? C U M I N -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:M, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need fourth to be N, so no.

So, back to the list.

We can also consider ""BUNCH"" but doesn't start with C.

We need to start with C.

""LUNCH"" doesn't start with C.

So, I think ""chunk"" or ""clung"" are good options.

But let's see if we can include more common consonants.

For example, T: is there a word like ""C_T N_"" ? 

""CATEN"" - not a word.

""COLTN"" - no.

""CHUTZ"" - not English.

So, perhaps T is not possible in this pattern with the eliminated letters.

Similarly, L: we have ""clung"", ""clunk"", etc.

U seems to be a common vowel we can use.

But we have U available.

We also have H, L, M, P, K, G, etc.

We might choose ""chunk"" to test H, U, K.

Or ""clump"" to test L, U, M, P.

But we have three positions, so we need three letters.

We are on the third guess, so we can try to get as much information as possible if we don't hit the word.

But note, we have only 6 guesses, so we should try to solve it.

The word might be ""chunk"", ""clung"", etc.

Another word: ""CHINA"" - but I and A eliminated.

""CONCH"" - O eliminated and not the pattern.

""CRWTH"" - R eliminated.

So, let's go with ""chunk"".

But we must ensure that the letters are not eliminated.

H: not eliminated
U: not eliminated
N: already known, but in position 4, and we are using it correctly.
K: not eliminated

So, ""chunk"" is valid.

We can also consider ""clunk"" with L instead of H.

But H and L are both possible.

We don't know which one.

We can choose one that uses less common letters to avoid wasting common letters if they are not present? But we need to test.

Since we have many letters, we might want to use a word that uses multiple new letters.

But in this case, both options use three new letters.

I think ""chunk"" is a good guess.

So, I'll go with ""chunk"".

Therefore, the third guess is ""chunk"".

But let's write it in the format.

<guess>chunk</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)  
  This indicates:  
  - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).  
  - R, A, and E are not in the word.  
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  
  So the secret word pattern is: `C _ _ N _`, and R, A, E are eliminated.

- **Guess 2: coins** → Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(x) N(✓) S(x)  
  This indicates:  
  - C and N are confirmed in their correct positions (positions 1 and 4).  
  - O, I, and S are not in the word.  
  So O, I, and S are added to the eliminated letters.

**Summary of known information:**  
- **Pattern:** The secret word is `C _ _ N _` (positions: 1=C, 4=N).  
- **Eliminated letters:** R, A, E, O, I, S (not in the word at all).  
- **Remaining possible letters:** B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- **Goal for the next guess:** Test new letters in positions 2, 3, and 5 to gather more information or solve the word.  

**Strategy for the third guess:**  
- Keep C in position 1 and N in position 4 to maintain known correct letters.  
- Use new, common consonants and vowels from the remaining letters to test positions 2, 3, and 5.  
- Avoid eliminated letters (R, A, E, O, I, S).  
- Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., T, L, U, H, M) to maximize information gain.  

**Possible word choices:**  
- Words like **CHUNK** (C H U N K), **CLUNG** (C L U N G), or **CLUMP** (C L U M P) fit the pattern and use new letters.  
- **CHUNK** is selected because:  
  - It tests H (common consonant), U (common vowel), and K (common consonant) in positions 2, 3, and 5.  
  - It is a common English word, avoiding obscurities.  
  - If incorrect, the feedback will reveal if H, U, or K are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.  

**Third guess:** CHUNK  
- Expected feedback will show:  
  - Position 1: C (✓)  
  - Position 2: H (feedback will indicate if H is present and in the correct position)  
  - Position 3: U (feedback will indicate if U is present and in the correct position)  
  - Position 4: N (✓)  
  - Position 5: K (feedback will indicate if K is present and in the correct position)  

This guess efficiently tests three new letters while adhering to the known constraints.

The secret word is: C _ _ N _

We need to find a word that:
- Starts with C
- Has N as the fourth letter
- The second, third, and fifth letters are from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, N, and the eliminated letters: R, A, E, O, I, S)

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We must form a valid English word of the pattern C _ _ N _

We can list possible words:

- The second letter can be: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- The third letter: same set
- The fifth letter: same set

But we need to form a real word.

Common words that fit:

- ""CHUNK"": C H U N K -> but H, U, K are not eliminated? H is available, U is available, K is available. But let's check: positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:U, 4:N, 5:K -> valid word? Yes, ""chunk"" is a word.

But we have to check if any of these letters are eliminated? H, U, K are not in the eliminated list.

Eliminated: R,A,E,O,I,S. So H, U, K are allowed.

Another possibility: ""CLUNG"": C L U N G -> L, U, G. ""Clung"" is a word.

""CHINK"": C H I N K -> but I is eliminated! We cannot use I because from guess 2, I is not in the word. So ""chink"" is invalid because of I.

Similarly, ""CLINK"" has I, which is eliminated.

""COUNT"": C O U N T -> O is eliminated, so no.

""COWNS"": C O W N S -> O and S are eliminated.

So, back to ""chunk"": C H U N K

Another: ""CHAMP"": but A is eliminated.

""CHUMP"": C H U M P -> H, U, M, P. ""Chump"" is a word.

""CLUMP"": C L U M P -> L, U, M, P.

""THING"": but doesn't start with C.

We need C at start.

""CYTON""? Not common.

""CHUNK"" seems good.

But let's see if there are other options to test more letters.

We have many letters left. We might want to use a word that uses common letters to maximize information.

For example, we can try to include T, L, U, etc.

But note: we have three positions to fill and many letters. We might get it in this guess if we are lucky.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tested to narrow down.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess.

We can try ""CHUNK"" or ""CLUMP"".

But let me think of words with T, since T is a common letter.

For example, ""CUTIN"": but I is eliminated.

""COUNT"": O eliminated.

""CHANT"": A eliminated.

""CLINT"": I eliminated.

So, no T in the pattern? Because T would have to be in position 2, 3, or 5.

For example, ""C_T_N_"" or ""C__TN_"" but we need the fourth to be N.

So, words like ""CUTIN"" (invalid due to I) or ""CATION"" (6 letters, no).

5-letter: ""CABIN"" - A and I eliminated.

No, so T might not be in the word? But we don't know.

We can try a word that has T, for example, ""CUTTY""? But that doesn't have N in the fourth position.

We need the fourth to be N.

Another word: ""COTAN"" - O and A eliminated.

So, perhaps T is not appearing in many words with this pattern? 

Let me list possible words:

- CHUNK: C H U N K
- CLUNK: C L U N K
- CHUMP: C H U M P
- CLUMP: C L U M P
- CHUGS: C H U G S -> but S is eliminated? S is eliminated, so we cannot use S. So ""chugs"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""CHUMS"" has S.

""CHUFF"": C H U F F -> but F is available, and ""chuff"" is a word? Meaning: to produce exhaust fumes. But it might be obscure.

""CLUNG"": C L U N G -> L, U, G. ""Clung"" is the past tense of cling, common.

""FLUNG"" doesn't start with C.

""CYCLIN""? Not 5 letters.

""COYING"" - O and I eliminated.

So, the most common words seem to be ""chunk"", ""clunk"", ""clung"", ""chump"", ""clump"".

We can also consider ""CHINO"" but O and I eliminated.

Another: ""KNOLL"" doesn't start with C.

Perhaps ""CUMIN"" - but U and I? I is eliminated, and also the fourth letter is I, not N? C U M I N -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:M, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need fourth to be N, so no.

So, back to the list.

We can also consider ""BUNCH"" but doesn't start with C.

We need to start with C.

""LUNCH"" doesn't start with C.

So, I think ""chunk"" or ""clung"" are good options.

But let's see if we can include more common consonants.

For example, T: is there a word like ""C_T N_"" ? 

""CATEN"" - not a word.

""COLTN"" - no.

""CHUTZ"" - not English.

So, perhaps T is not possible in this pattern with the eliminated letters.

Similarly, L: we have ""clung"", ""clunk"", etc.

U seems to be a common vowel we can use.

But we have U available.

We also have H, L, M, P, K, G, etc.

We might choose ""chunk"" to test H, U, K.

Or ""clump"" to test L, U, M, P.

But we have three positions, so we need three letters.

We are on the third guess, so we can try to get as much information as possible if we don't hit the word.

But note, we have only 6 guesses, so we should try to solve it.

The word might be ""chunk"", ""clung"", etc.

Another word: ""CHINA"" - but I and A eliminated.

""CONCH"" - O eliminated and not the pattern.

""CRWTH"" - R eliminated.

So, let's go with ""chunk"".

But we must ensure that the letters are not eliminated.

H: not eliminated
U: not eliminated
N: already known, but in position 4, and we are using it correctly.
K: not eliminated

So, ""chunk"" is valid.

We can also consider ""clunk"" with L instead of H.

But H and L are both possible.

We don't know which one.

We can choose one that uses less common letters to avoid wasting common letters if they are not present? But we need to test.

Since we have many letters, we might want to use a word that uses multiple new letters.

But in this case, both options use three new letters.

I think ""chunk"" is a good guess.

So, I'll go with ""chunk"".

Therefore, the third guess is ""chunk"".

But let's write it in the format.

<guess>chunk</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)  
  This indicates:  
  - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).  
  - R, A, and E are not in the word.  
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  
  So the secret word pattern is: `C _ _ N _`, and R, A, E are eliminated.

- **Guess 2: coins** → Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(x) N(✓) S(x)  
  This indicates:  
  - C and N are confirmed in their correct positions (positions 1 and 4).  
  - O, I, and S are not in the word.  
  So O, I, and S are added to the eliminated letters.

**Summary of known information:**  
- **Pattern:** The secret word is `C _ _ N _` (positions: 1=C, 4=N).  
- **Eliminated letters:** R, A, E, O, I, S (not in the word at all).  
- **Remaining possible letters:** B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- **Goal for the next guess:** Test new letters in positions 2, 3, and 5 to gather more information or solve the word.  

**Strategy for the third guess:**  
- Keep C in position 1 and N in position 4 to maintain known correct letters.  
- Use new, common consonants and vowels from the remaining letters to test positions 2, 3, and 5.  
- Avoid eliminated letters (R, A, E, O, I, S).  
- Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., T, L, U, H, M) to maximize information gain.  

**Possible word choices:**  
- Words like **CHUNK** (C H U N K), **CLUNG** (C L U N G), or **CLUMP** (C L U M P) fit the pattern and use new letters.  
- **CHUNK** is selected because:  
  - It tests H (common consonant), U (common vowel), and K (common consonant) in positions 2, 3, and 5.  
  - It is a common English word, avoiding obscurities.  
  - If incorrect, the feedback will reveal if H, U, or K are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.  

**Third guess:** CHUNK  
- Expected feedback will show:  
  - Position 1: C (✓)  
  - Position 2: H (feedback will indicate if H is present and in the correct position)  
  - Position 3: U (feedback will indicate if U is present and in the correct position)  
  - Position 4: N (✓)  
  - Position 5: K (feedback will indicate if K is present and in the correct position)  

This guess efficiently tests three new letters while adhering to the known constraints.",Guess 3: chunk -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) U(✓) N(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
