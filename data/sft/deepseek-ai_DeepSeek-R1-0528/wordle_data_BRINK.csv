We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.
 The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:
   - It contains 'R', 'O', 'A', 'S', 'T' — all common letters.
   - It has two vowels ('O' and 'A') and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let's go with ""ROAST"" for now.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we might avoid repeating those.

 Another popular choice is ""ADIEU"" because it has many vowels, but it has only one common consonant. We want to maximize information.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a very good starting word because:
   - It has three consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - The letters C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common.

 But let me check: the word ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a strong starter.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these is fine. I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".
</think>
I need to make the first guess in this Wordle-like game. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good starter typically includes common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to cover frequent patterns. 

After considering options:
- **Common letters**: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C are among the most frequent in English.
- **Vowel coverage**: Including at least two vowels (like A and E) helps test critical positions.
- **Avoid repeats**: Using distinct letters increases the chance of hitting multiple matches.

Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ROAST"" are strong candidates. I'll choose **""CRANE""** because:
- It contains 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E).
- All letters are distinct, covering 5 unique high-frequency characters.
- It avoids rare letters (like J, Q, Z) and positions vowels flexibly.

This guess should provide useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent turns.

We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the fourth letter)
  E: x (not in the word)

 Therefore, we know:
  - The word has R in the second position and N in the fourth position.
  - The letters C, A, E are not in the word at all.

 The secret word has the form: _ R _ N _

 Since C, A, and E are eliminated, we must choose a word that:
  - Has the second letter R and the fourth letter N.
  - Contains no C, A, or E.

 We also know that the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of letters that can be in the first, third, and fifth positions.

 Remember, we have 5 more guesses (this is the second of 6), so we want to maximize information.

 Since we know two letters (R and N) and their positions, we can try to fill the other positions with common letters that are not eliminated.

 Eliminated letters: C, A, E.

 The word structure: [letter1] R [letter3] N [letter5]

 We should try to use common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as T, L, S, O, I, etc.

 For example, common words matching this pattern: 
  - ""IRONy"" but that's 5 letters? Actually, ""IRONY"" is 5 letters: I-R-O-N-Y -> positions: I in first, R second, O third, N fourth, Y fifth.

 But let's check: are there other possibilities? We need to avoid A, C, E.

 Other examples:
  - ""URBAN"": U-R-B-A-N -> but A is eliminated, so invalid because of A? Wait, the word cannot have A because of the feedback.
    Actually, the feedback said A is not in the word, so ""URBAN"" has A -> invalid.

  - ""CROWN"": has C? C is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""BROWN"": B-R-O-W-N -> 
      First letter: B (not eliminated)
      Third: O
      Fourth: N (known)
      Fifth: N? No, fifth is N? Wait, the word is B-R-O-W-N, so fifth is N? Actually, no: B (1), R (2), O (3), W (4)? No, wait: positions:
        B (1), R (2), O (3), W (4), N (5) -> so fourth is W, not N -> but we need fourth to be N? So this doesn't match.

  We need the fourth letter to be N.

  Correct pattern: _ R _ N _

  So in ""BROWN"", the N is fifth, so not matching.

  Let's think of words ending with N? Actually, the fourth position is N, so the word ends with something? It's _ R _ N _

  So the last letter can be anything.

  Words: 
    ""HORNS"": H-R (then O?): H (1), R (2), O (3), N (4)? Then S (5). Wait, H-R-O-N-S -> but the fourth is O? No: 
        Position 1: H
        Position 2: R
        Position 3: O
        Position 4: N -> wait, that would be ... let me spell: H-O-R-N-S? That's not right. Actually, ""HORNS"" is H-O-R-N-S? 
        But we need R in second and N in fourth. In ""HORNS"":
          H at pos1, O at pos2, R at pos3, N at pos4? Then S at pos5 -> but that would be: H O R N S -> so second letter is O, not R. So no.

  Alternatively, let's list words that have second letter R and fourth letter N.

  Some candidate words:
    ""IRONY"": I-R-O-N-Y -> 
      I at 1, R at 2, O at 3, N at 4, Y at 5 -> matches pattern and no A, C, E -> valid candidate.

    ""URINE"": U-R-I-N-E -> but E is eliminated -> invalid.

    ""TREND"": T-R-E-N-D -> E is eliminated -> invalid.

    ""GRIND"": G-R-I-N-D -> 
        Fourth letter is N? G-R-I-N-D -> positions: G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) -> so yes.
        Letters: G, R, I, N, D. Eliminated letters: C, A, E. So G, I, D are not eliminated? We don't have feedback on them yet.

    ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5) -> no eliminated letters.

    ""PRION"": P-R-I-O-N -> P(1), R(2), I(3), O(4)? Wait, O is fourth? Then N fifth? So structure: P-R-I-O-N -> fourth is O? Not N -> no.

    ""CRONY"": C-R-O-N-Y -> but C is eliminated -> invalid.

    ""GROIN"": G-R-O-I-N -> 
        G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), N(5) -> fourth letter is I, not N -> no.

  Wait, note: we need fourth letter N, so the word must have N at the fourth position.

  Another one: ""WRING"": W-R-I-N-G -> W(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> valid? Letters: W, I, G are not eliminated.

  ""TRUNK"": T-R-U-N-K -> T(1), R(2), U(3), N(4), K(5) -> U and T, K? Not eliminated.

  ""BRINK"": B-R-I-N-K -> B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> valid.

  But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible to gather more information.

  Best candidates: 
    ""IRONY"", ""GRIND"", ""BRINY"", ""WRING"", ""TRUNK"", ""BRINK""

  We also note that the first guess eliminated A, C, E, so we avoid those.

  Now, we have two correct positions: R at 2 and N at 4. The other positions (1, 3, 5) are unknown.

  We want to maximize information: so we should try to include letters that are common and that we haven't tried.

  In the first guess we tried C, R, A, N, E. So we have feedback on R and N (correct), and eliminated C, A, E.

  For the next guess, we can choose a word that has:
    - Second letter R, fourth letter N.
    - Other positions: use common letters not tested yet, such as T, O, I, S, L, B, D, etc.

  Since we have many candidates, let's pick one that covers multiple possibilities.

  Note: we must avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, E.

  Let's choose ""BRINY"":
    B: not tested
    R: known correct
    I: not tested
    N: known correct
    Y: not tested

  Alternatively, ""TRUNK"" would test T, U, K.

  We might also consider ""IRONY"": I, O, Y are new.

  However, we know that the first guess had A and E eliminated, which are vowels. So we should test other vowels? The remaining vowels are I, O, U.

  The word ""IRONY"" covers two vowels (I and O) and Y (which can be vowel-like).

  Another good candidate: ""WRING"" tests W, I, G.

  But perhaps we should prioritize words that have letters that appear frequently in five-letter words.

  Since we have three unknown positions, we might try to get them all in one go.

  But note: if we guess a word that has R and N in the correct places, and if we get other letters correct, we might solve it faster.

  Let's think strategy: we have 5 remaining guesses? Actually, we have 5 more after the first (since total 6, we used 1). This is the second guess.

  We can choose a word that covers common vowels and consonants.

  I think ""BRINY"" is a reasonable choice: 
    Common letters: B, R, I, N, Y.
    We already know R and N are in the word and fixed. We are testing B, I, Y.

  Alternatively, ""TRUNK"" tests T, U, N, K. But we already know N is in.

  However, I recall that we also need to be cautious: if the unknown positions are consonants or vowels.

  Another popular choice might be ""PRINT"": P-R-I-N-T -> 
        Fourth letter is N? P-R-I-N-T -> positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes.
        Letters: P, R, I, N, T. T is a common consonant. But we haven't tested T.

  But note: T is not eliminated? We haven't tested T, so it's a good candidate.

  Similarly, ""GRINT"" is not a word? Let me check: not sure, but ""GRINT"" might not be valid. But ""GRIND"" we thought earlier.

  Actually, ""PRINT"" is a valid word: 
        We know the pattern is _ R _ N _, and ""PRINT"" is P-R-I-N-T -> fits.

  ""GRIND"" is G-R-I-N-D -> also fits.

  Now, comparing ""PRINT"" and ""BRINY"":
    Both test I at the third position. 
    ""PRINT"" tests P and T (T at fifth), while ""BRINY"" tests B and Y.

  Since T is more common than Y and P is common, ""PRINT"" might be better.

  But note: we have eliminated vowels A and E, so testing I and other vowels (O, U) is important.

  ""PRINT"" has vowels? I is a vowel. 

  So, which word gives the most information?

  We want to test letters that are likely to appear and haven't been eliminated.

  Let's list the available letters: excluding C, A, E.

  Common available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  But note: R and N are already in the word, but we know their positions.

  We are focusing on positions 1, 3, 5.

  Position 1: commonly T, S, B, P, ... 
  Position 3: commonly vowels (I, O, U) or consonants.
  Position 5: commonly T, S, D, Y, etc.

  So a word that includes a vowel (I, O, U) in position 3 would be good.

  Both ""IRONY"" and ""PRINT"" have I at position 3? 
    For ""PRINT"": P(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> I at third.
  ""IRONY"": I(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> O at third? Actually, third letter is O.

  Correction: ""IRONY"" is I-R-O-N-Y -> so third letter O.

  So ""PRINT"" has I at third and ""IRONY"" has O at third.

  We don't know which vowel is present? So choosing a word that uses one of these vowels might help.

  Another candidate: ""CRITH"" is not valid? 

  Considering we want to maximize new letters, I propose ""PRINT"" because:
    P and T are common letters that we haven't tested.

  But wait: we know R and N are in the word and correct, so if we guess ""PRINT"", we are testing:
    P at position 1: if it is correct we get ✓, else if it exists elsewhere we get -, or x.
    I at position 3: same, could be correct? 
    T at position 5: same.

  It's structured so that if the word is ""PRINT"", we win, else we get feedback on P, I, T.

  Similarly, with ""BRINY"" we test B, I, Y.

  Between common letters: T is more common than Y.

  However, we have not tested any of I, O, U vowels yet. Testing one (I or O) is important.

  Perhaps we can choose a word that uses O? For example, ""IRONY"" uses O at position 3.

  Since we have two vowels left (I, O, U), and we don't know which, testing one of them might help eliminate.

  But note: we have 5 tries left, we can test one vowel at a time.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that contains multiple vowels? But we have only one vowel slot (position 3) unless the word has vowels at other positions?

  Actually, position 1 and 5 can be vowels too? For example, ""OPERA"" but we don't know.

  But in our pattern _ R _ N _, the first or fifth could be vowels.

  Considering we don't know what the vowels are (apart from eliminating A and E), we should try to cover vowels.

  However, we are constrained by the pattern.

  Let me list words that fit the pattern: 
    Words we can try: 
      - PRINT (vowel I at third, tests P, T)
      - BRINY (vowel I at third, tests B, Y)
      - IRONY (vowel O at third, tests I, Y) -> wait, I at first and O at third.
      - TRUNK (vowel U at third, tests T, U, K)
      - GROIN (but does not have N at fourth) -> no.
      - BROWN (incorrect pattern) -> no.

  After looking, ""TRUNK"" might be a good choice because it tests U (vowel) and T, K. But U at position 3? Yes.

  How about ""FRONT"": F-R-O-N-T -> 
        Positions: F(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), T(5) -> matches, no eliminated letters? 
        Eliminated: we didn't test F, O, T. And O is a vowel.

  So ""FRONT"" tests F, O, T.

  It covers the vowel O and two common consonants (F and T).

  So from information perspective, ""FRONT"" uses O which we haven't tested (a vowel) and T which is common.

  It provides:
    F: at first position
    O: at third
    T: at fifth

  This seems efficient.

  Alternatively, ""CRWTH"" is not valid? 

  So among the candidates: 
    ""IRONY"", ""PRINT"", ""TRUNK"", ""BRINY"", ""FRONT"", ""GRIND""

  Let's decide:

  We want to choose a word that uses the pattern, avoids eliminated letters, and introduces new letters that are common.

  I think ""PRINT"" and ""FRONT"" are both strong.

  But note: the word cannot have E or A, so vowels are limited to I, O, U.

  Since we have more consonants to test, but vowels are critical. Testing O might be as good as testing I.

  However, let's consider frequency: 
    In five-letter words, E and A are the most common vowels, but we know they aren't present. So the next common vowels are O, I, U.

  O is more common than I and U? Not sure, but both should be tested.

  We are going to guess one word, so we pick one.

  I think I'll go with ""PRINT"" because:
    - It includes two very common consonants (P and T) and a vowel (I) in its typical position (vowels often in the middle).
    - The chance of I being present is significant.

  So my second guess is ""PRINT"".

  However, let me check: what if the word is ""FRONT""? Then by guessing ""PRINT"", we leave F and O untested.

  But we can only test so many letters per guess.

  Another candidate: ""POINT"": has O? P-O-I-N-T -> 
        Positions: P(1), O(2)? but we need second position R -> not possible.

  Only words with R in second and N in fourth.

  After reconsideration: ""FRONT"" might be better because:
    - It tests the vowel O (in the middle) and T (at the end).
    - Also tests F (less common but possible).

  And F is a common starting consonant? Not as common as others.

  Actually, T is a very common ending letter.

  Since the fifth position has T in many words, testing T at the end is good.

  So I'll switch to ""FRONT"".

  Final decision: ""FRONT"".

  Steps:
    We know: second letter R, fourth letter N, and not C, A, E.
    Guess ""FRONT"": 
        F at 1, R at 2, O at 3, N at 4, T at 5.

  If the feedback shows:
      - F is not in the word? We eliminate F.
      - O might be present or not? At position 3? If not, we eliminate O if it's not present.
      - T at end? Similarly.

  And R and N should be correct again.

  Using this, we can narrow down.

  So let's guess ""FRONT"".

<guess>front</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **R** is correct and in the second position (✓).
- **N** is correct and in the fourth position (✓).
- **C**, **A**, and **E** are not in the word (x).

The secret word follows the pattern: **\_ R \_ N \_**, with no C, A, or E. 

For the second guess:
- Prioritize high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., T, O, I, S, L).
- Focus on vowels (O, I, U) since A and E are eliminated.
- Ensure the guess fits the pattern **\_ R \_ N \_**.

**Analysis of candidates**:
- ""PRINT"": Tests P (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), T (common ending). Covers common consonants and a vowel.
- ""FRONT"": Tests F (position 1), O (vowel, position 3), T (position 5). Efficiently checks O and T.
- ""TRUNK"": Tests T (position 1), U (vowel, position 3), K (position 5). Good vowel/consonant balance.
- ""BRINY"": Tests B (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), Y (position 5). Less common letters.

**Chosen word**: ""FRONT""
- Reasons:
  - Tests **O** (key vowel candidate).
  - Uses **T** (common ending letter).
  - Maximizes new information with high-frequency letters.
  - Fits the pattern: **F** R **O** N **T**.

This guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.

<guess>front</guess>",front,"We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the fourth letter)
  E: x (not in the word)

 Therefore, we know:
  - The word has R in the second position and N in the fourth position.
  - The letters C, A, E are not in the word at all.

 The secret word has the form: _ R _ N _

 Since C, A, and E are eliminated, we must choose a word that:
  - Has the second letter R and the fourth letter N.
  - Contains no C, A, or E.

 We also know that the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of letters that can be in the first, third, and fifth positions.

 Remember, we have 5 more guesses (this is the second of 6), so we want to maximize information.

 Since we know two letters (R and N) and their positions, we can try to fill the other positions with common letters that are not eliminated.

 Eliminated letters: C, A, E.

 The word structure: [letter1] R [letter3] N [letter5]

 We should try to use common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as T, L, S, O, I, etc.

 For example, common words matching this pattern: 
  - ""IRONy"" but that's 5 letters? Actually, ""IRONY"" is 5 letters: I-R-O-N-Y -> positions: I in first, R second, O third, N fourth, Y fifth.

 But let's check: are there other possibilities? We need to avoid A, C, E.

 Other examples:
  - ""URBAN"": U-R-B-A-N -> but A is eliminated, so invalid because of A? Wait, the word cannot have A because of the feedback.
    Actually, the feedback said A is not in the word, so ""URBAN"" has A -> invalid.

  - ""CROWN"": has C? C is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""BROWN"": B-R-O-W-N -> 
      First letter: B (not eliminated)
      Third: O
      Fourth: N (known)
      Fifth: N? No, fifth is N? Wait, the word is B-R-O-W-N, so fifth is N? Actually, no: B (1), R (2), O (3), W (4)? No, wait: positions:
        B (1), R (2), O (3), W (4), N (5) -> so fourth is W, not N -> but we need fourth to be N? So this doesn't match.

  We need the fourth letter to be N.

  Correct pattern: _ R _ N _

  So in ""BROWN"", the N is fifth, so not matching.

  Let's think of words ending with N? Actually, the fourth position is N, so the word ends with something? It's _ R _ N _

  So the last letter can be anything.

  Words: 
    ""HORNS"": H-R (then O?): H (1), R (2), O (3), N (4)? Then S (5). Wait, H-R-O-N-S -> but the fourth is O? No: 
        Position 1: H
        Position 2: R
        Position 3: O
        Position 4: N -> wait, that would be ... let me spell: H-O-R-N-S? That's not right. Actually, ""HORNS"" is H-O-R-N-S? 
        But we need R in second and N in fourth. In ""HORNS"":
          H at pos1, O at pos2, R at pos3, N at pos4? Then S at pos5 -> but that would be: H O R N S -> so second letter is O, not R. So no.

  Alternatively, let's list words that have second letter R and fourth letter N.

  Some candidate words:
    ""IRONY"": I-R-O-N-Y -> 
      I at 1, R at 2, O at 3, N at 4, Y at 5 -> matches pattern and no A, C, E -> valid candidate.

    ""URINE"": U-R-I-N-E -> but E is eliminated -> invalid.

    ""TREND"": T-R-E-N-D -> E is eliminated -> invalid.

    ""GRIND"": G-R-I-N-D -> 
        Fourth letter is N? G-R-I-N-D -> positions: G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) -> so yes.
        Letters: G, R, I, N, D. Eliminated letters: C, A, E. So G, I, D are not eliminated? We don't have feedback on them yet.

    ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5) -> no eliminated letters.

    ""PRION"": P-R-I-O-N -> P(1), R(2), I(3), O(4)? Wait, O is fourth? Then N fifth? So structure: P-R-I-O-N -> fourth is O? Not N -> no.

    ""CRONY"": C-R-O-N-Y -> but C is eliminated -> invalid.

    ""GROIN"": G-R-O-I-N -> 
        G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), N(5) -> fourth letter is I, not N -> no.

  Wait, note: we need fourth letter N, so the word must have N at the fourth position.

  Another one: ""WRING"": W-R-I-N-G -> W(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> valid? Letters: W, I, G are not eliminated.

  ""TRUNK"": T-R-U-N-K -> T(1), R(2), U(3), N(4), K(5) -> U and T, K? Not eliminated.

  ""BRINK"": B-R-I-N-K -> B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> valid.

  But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible to gather more information.

  Best candidates: 
    ""IRONY"", ""GRIND"", ""BRINY"", ""WRING"", ""TRUNK"", ""BRINK""

  We also note that the first guess eliminated A, C, E, so we avoid those.

  Now, we have two correct positions: R at 2 and N at 4. The other positions (1, 3, 5) are unknown.

  We want to maximize information: so we should try to include letters that are common and that we haven't tried.

  In the first guess we tried C, R, A, N, E. So we have feedback on R and N (correct), and eliminated C, A, E.

  For the next guess, we can choose a word that has:
    - Second letter R, fourth letter N.
    - Other positions: use common letters not tested yet, such as T, O, I, S, L, B, D, etc.

  Since we have many candidates, let's pick one that covers multiple possibilities.

  Note: we must avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, E.

  Let's choose ""BRINY"":
    B: not tested
    R: known correct
    I: not tested
    N: known correct
    Y: not tested

  Alternatively, ""TRUNK"" would test T, U, K.

  We might also consider ""IRONY"": I, O, Y are new.

  However, we know that the first guess had A and E eliminated, which are vowels. So we should test other vowels? The remaining vowels are I, O, U.

  The word ""IRONY"" covers two vowels (I and O) and Y (which can be vowel-like).

  Another good candidate: ""WRING"" tests W, I, G.

  But perhaps we should prioritize words that have letters that appear frequently in five-letter words.

  Since we have three unknown positions, we might try to get them all in one go.

  But note: if we guess a word that has R and N in the correct places, and if we get other letters correct, we might solve it faster.

  Let's think strategy: we have 5 remaining guesses? Actually, we have 5 more after the first (since total 6, we used 1). This is the second guess.

  We can choose a word that covers common vowels and consonants.

  I think ""BRINY"" is a reasonable choice: 
    Common letters: B, R, I, N, Y.
    We already know R and N are in the word and fixed. We are testing B, I, Y.

  Alternatively, ""TRUNK"" tests T, U, N, K. But we already know N is in.

  However, I recall that we also need to be cautious: if the unknown positions are consonants or vowels.

  Another popular choice might be ""PRINT"": P-R-I-N-T -> 
        Fourth letter is N? P-R-I-N-T -> positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes.
        Letters: P, R, I, N, T. T is a common consonant. But we haven't tested T.

  But note: T is not eliminated? We haven't tested T, so it's a good candidate.

  Similarly, ""GRINT"" is not a word? Let me check: not sure, but ""GRINT"" might not be valid. But ""GRIND"" we thought earlier.

  Actually, ""PRINT"" is a valid word: 
        We know the pattern is _ R _ N _, and ""PRINT"" is P-R-I-N-T -> fits.

  ""GRIND"" is G-R-I-N-D -> also fits.

  Now, comparing ""PRINT"" and ""BRINY"":
    Both test I at the third position. 
    ""PRINT"" tests P and T (T at fifth), while ""BRINY"" tests B and Y.

  Since T is more common than Y and P is common, ""PRINT"" might be better.

  But note: we have eliminated vowels A and E, so testing I and other vowels (O, U) is important.

  ""PRINT"" has vowels? I is a vowel. 

  So, which word gives the most information?

  We want to test letters that are likely to appear and haven't been eliminated.

  Let's list the available letters: excluding C, A, E.

  Common available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  But note: R and N are already in the word, but we know their positions.

  We are focusing on positions 1, 3, 5.

  Position 1: commonly T, S, B, P, ... 
  Position 3: commonly vowels (I, O, U) or consonants.
  Position 5: commonly T, S, D, Y, etc.

  So a word that includes a vowel (I, O, U) in position 3 would be good.

  Both ""IRONY"" and ""PRINT"" have I at position 3? 
    For ""PRINT"": P(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> I at third.
  ""IRONY"": I(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> O at third? Actually, third letter is O.

  Correction: ""IRONY"" is I-R-O-N-Y -> so third letter O.

  So ""PRINT"" has I at third and ""IRONY"" has O at third.

  We don't know which vowel is present? So choosing a word that uses one of these vowels might help.

  Another candidate: ""CRITH"" is not valid? 

  Considering we want to maximize new letters, I propose ""PRINT"" because:
    P and T are common letters that we haven't tested.

  But wait: we know R and N are in the word and correct, so if we guess ""PRINT"", we are testing:
    P at position 1: if it is correct we get ✓, else if it exists elsewhere we get -, or x.
    I at position 3: same, could be correct? 
    T at position 5: same.

  It's structured so that if the word is ""PRINT"", we win, else we get feedback on P, I, T.

  Similarly, with ""BRINY"" we test B, I, Y.

  Between common letters: T is more common than Y.

  However, we have not tested any of I, O, U vowels yet. Testing one (I or O) is important.

  Perhaps we can choose a word that uses O? For example, ""IRONY"" uses O at position 3.

  Since we have two vowels left (I, O, U), and we don't know which, testing one of them might help eliminate.

  But note: we have 5 tries left, we can test one vowel at a time.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that contains multiple vowels? But we have only one vowel slot (position 3) unless the word has vowels at other positions?

  Actually, position 1 and 5 can be vowels too? For example, ""OPERA"" but we don't know.

  But in our pattern _ R _ N _, the first or fifth could be vowels.

  Considering we don't know what the vowels are (apart from eliminating A and E), we should try to cover vowels.

  However, we are constrained by the pattern.

  Let me list words that fit the pattern: 
    Words we can try: 
      - PRINT (vowel I at third, tests P, T)
      - BRINY (vowel I at third, tests B, Y)
      - IRONY (vowel O at third, tests I, Y) -> wait, I at first and O at third.
      - TRUNK (vowel U at third, tests T, U, K)
      - GROIN (but does not have N at fourth) -> no.
      - BROWN (incorrect pattern) -> no.

  After looking, ""TRUNK"" might be a good choice because it tests U (vowel) and T, K. But U at position 3? Yes.

  How about ""FRONT"": F-R-O-N-T -> 
        Positions: F(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), T(5) -> matches, no eliminated letters? 
        Eliminated: we didn't test F, O, T. And O is a vowel.

  So ""FRONT"" tests F, O, T.

  It covers the vowel O and two common consonants (F and T).

  So from information perspective, ""FRONT"" uses O which we haven't tested (a vowel) and T which is common.

  It provides:
    F: at first position
    O: at third
    T: at fifth

  This seems efficient.

  Alternatively, ""CRWTH"" is not valid? 

  So among the candidates: 
    ""IRONY"", ""PRINT"", ""TRUNK"", ""BRINY"", ""FRONT"", ""GRIND""

  Let's decide:

  We want to choose a word that uses the pattern, avoids eliminated letters, and introduces new letters that are common.

  I think ""PRINT"" and ""FRONT"" are both strong.

  But note: the word cannot have E or A, so vowels are limited to I, O, U.

  Since we have more consonants to test, but vowels are critical. Testing O might be as good as testing I.

  However, let's consider frequency: 
    In five-letter words, E and A are the most common vowels, but we know they aren't present. So the next common vowels are O, I, U.

  O is more common than I and U? Not sure, but both should be tested.

  We are going to guess one word, so we pick one.

  I think I'll go with ""PRINT"" because:
    - It includes two very common consonants (P and T) and a vowel (I) in its typical position (vowels often in the middle).
    - The chance of I being present is significant.

  So my second guess is ""PRINT"".

  However, let me check: what if the word is ""FRONT""? Then by guessing ""PRINT"", we leave F and O untested.

  But we can only test so many letters per guess.

  Another candidate: ""POINT"": has O? P-O-I-N-T -> 
        Positions: P(1), O(2)? but we need second position R -> not possible.

  Only words with R in second and N in fourth.

  After reconsideration: ""FRONT"" might be better because:
    - It tests the vowel O (in the middle) and T (at the end).
    - Also tests F (less common but possible).

  And F is a common starting consonant? Not as common as others.

  Actually, T is a very common ending letter.

  Since the fifth position has T in many words, testing T at the end is good.

  So I'll switch to ""FRONT"".

  Final decision: ""FRONT"".

  Steps:
    We know: second letter R, fourth letter N, and not C, A, E.
    Guess ""FRONT"": 
        F at 1, R at 2, O at 3, N at 4, T at 5.

  If the feedback shows:
      - F is not in the word? We eliminate F.
      - O might be present or not? At position 3? If not, we eliminate O if it's not present.
      - T at end? Similarly.

  And R and N should be correct again.

  Using this, we can narrow down.

  So let's guess ""FRONT"".

<guess>front</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **R** is correct and in the second position (✓).
- **N** is correct and in the fourth position (✓).
- **C**, **A**, and **E** are not in the word (x).

The secret word follows the pattern: **\_ R \_ N \_**, with no C, A, or E. 

For the second guess:
- Prioritize high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., T, O, I, S, L).
- Focus on vowels (O, I, U) since A and E are eliminated.
- Ensure the guess fits the pattern **\_ R \_ N \_**.

**Analysis of candidates**:
- ""PRINT"": Tests P (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), T (common ending). Covers common consonants and a vowel.
- ""FRONT"": Tests F (position 1), O (vowel, position 3), T (position 5). Efficiently checks O and T.
- ""TRUNK"": Tests T (position 1), U (vowel, position 3), K (position 5). Good vowel/consonant balance.
- ""BRINY"": Tests B (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), Y (position 5). Less common letters.

**Chosen word**: ""FRONT""
- Reasons:
  - Tests **O** (key vowel candidate).
  - Uses **T** (common ending letter).
  - Maximizes new information with high-frequency letters.
  - Fits the pattern: **F** R **O** N **T**.

This guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.",Guess 2: front -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) T(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.
 The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:
   - It contains 'R', 'O', 'A', 'S', 'T' — all common letters.
   - It has two vowels ('O' and 'A') and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let's go with ""ROAST"" for now.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we might avoid repeating those.

 Another popular choice is ""ADIEU"" because it has many vowels, but it has only one common consonant. We want to maximize information.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a very good starting word because:
   - It has three consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - The letters C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common.

 But let me check: the word ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a strong starter.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these is fine. I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I need to make the first guess in this Wordle-like game. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good starter typically includes common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to cover frequent patterns. 

After considering options:
- **Common letters**: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C are among the most frequent in English.
- **Vowel coverage**: Including at least two vowels (like A and E) helps test critical positions.
- **Avoid repeats**: Using distinct letters increases the chance of hitting multiple matches.

Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ROAST"" are strong candidates. I'll choose **""CRANE""** because:
- It contains 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E).
- All letters are distinct, covering 5 unique high-frequency characters.
- It avoids rare letters (like J, Q, Z) and positions vowels flexibly.

This guess should provide useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent turns.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the fourth letter)
  E: x (not in the word)

 Therefore, we know:
  - The word has R in the second position and N in the fourth position.
  - The letters C, A, E are not in the word at all.

 The secret word has the form: _ R _ N _

 Since C, A, and E are eliminated, we must choose a word that:
  - Has the second letter R and the fourth letter N.
  - Contains no C, A, or E.

 We also know that the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of letters that can be in the first, third, and fifth positions.

 Remember, we have 5 more guesses (this is the second of 6), so we want to maximize information.

 Since we know two letters (R and N) and their positions, we can try to fill the other positions with common letters that are not eliminated.

 Eliminated letters: C, A, E.

 The word structure: [letter1] R [letter3] N [letter5]

 We should try to use common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as T, L, S, O, I, etc.

 For example, common words matching this pattern: 
  - ""IRONy"" but that's 5 letters? Actually, ""IRONY"" is 5 letters: I-R-O-N-Y -> positions: I in first, R second, O third, N fourth, Y fifth.

 But let's check: are there other possibilities? We need to avoid A, C, E.

 Other examples:
  - ""URBAN"": U-R-B-A-N -> but A is eliminated, so invalid because of A? Wait, the word cannot have A because of the feedback.
    Actually, the feedback said A is not in the word, so ""URBAN"" has A -> invalid.

  - ""CROWN"": has C? C is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""BROWN"": B-R-O-W-N -> 
      First letter: B (not eliminated)
      Third: O
      Fourth: N (known)
      Fifth: N? No, fifth is N? Wait, the word is B-R-O-W-N, so fifth is N? Actually, no: B (1), R (2), O (3), W (4)? No, wait: positions:
        B (1), R (2), O (3), W (4), N (5) -> so fourth is W, not N -> but we need fourth to be N? So this doesn't match.

  We need the fourth letter to be N.

  Correct pattern: _ R _ N _

  So in ""BROWN"", the N is fifth, so not matching.

  Let's think of words ending with N? Actually, the fourth position is N, so the word ends with something? It's _ R _ N _

  So the last letter can be anything.

  Words: 
    ""HORNS"": H-R (then O?): H (1), R (2), O (3), N (4)? Then S (5). Wait, H-R-O-N-S -> but the fourth is O? No: 
        Position 1: H
        Position 2: R
        Position 3: O
        Position 4: N -> wait, that would be ... let me spell: H-O-R-N-S? That's not right. Actually, ""HORNS"" is H-O-R-N-S? 
        But we need R in second and N in fourth. In ""HORNS"":
          H at pos1, O at pos2, R at pos3, N at pos4? Then S at pos5 -> but that would be: H O R N S -> so second letter is O, not R. So no.

  Alternatively, let's list words that have second letter R and fourth letter N.

  Some candidate words:
    ""IRONY"": I-R-O-N-Y -> 
      I at 1, R at 2, O at 3, N at 4, Y at 5 -> matches pattern and no A, C, E -> valid candidate.

    ""URINE"": U-R-I-N-E -> but E is eliminated -> invalid.

    ""TREND"": T-R-E-N-D -> E is eliminated -> invalid.

    ""GRIND"": G-R-I-N-D -> 
        Fourth letter is N? G-R-I-N-D -> positions: G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) -> so yes.
        Letters: G, R, I, N, D. Eliminated letters: C, A, E. So G, I, D are not eliminated? We don't have feedback on them yet.

    ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5) -> no eliminated letters.

    ""PRION"": P-R-I-O-N -> P(1), R(2), I(3), O(4)? Wait, O is fourth? Then N fifth? So structure: P-R-I-O-N -> fourth is O? Not N -> no.

    ""CRONY"": C-R-O-N-Y -> but C is eliminated -> invalid.

    ""GROIN"": G-R-O-I-N -> 
        G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), N(5) -> fourth letter is I, not N -> no.

  Wait, note: we need fourth letter N, so the word must have N at the fourth position.

  Another one: ""WRING"": W-R-I-N-G -> W(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> valid? Letters: W, I, G are not eliminated.

  ""TRUNK"": T-R-U-N-K -> T(1), R(2), U(3), N(4), K(5) -> U and T, K? Not eliminated.

  ""BRINK"": B-R-I-N-K -> B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> valid.

  But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible to gather more information.

  Best candidates: 
    ""IRONY"", ""GRIND"", ""BRINY"", ""WRING"", ""TRUNK"", ""BRINK""

  We also note that the first guess eliminated A, C, E, so we avoid those.

  Now, we have two correct positions: R at 2 and N at 4. The other positions (1, 3, 5) are unknown.

  We want to maximize information: so we should try to include letters that are common and that we haven't tried.

  In the first guess we tried C, R, A, N, E. So we have feedback on R and N (correct), and eliminated C, A, E.

  For the next guess, we can choose a word that has:
    - Second letter R, fourth letter N.
    - Other positions: use common letters not tested yet, such as T, O, I, S, L, B, D, etc.

  Since we have many candidates, let's pick one that covers multiple possibilities.

  Note: we must avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, E.

  Let's choose ""BRINY"":
    B: not tested
    R: known correct
    I: not tested
    N: known correct
    Y: not tested

  Alternatively, ""TRUNK"" would test T, U, K.

  We might also consider ""IRONY"": I, O, Y are new.

  However, we know that the first guess had A and E eliminated, which are vowels. So we should test other vowels? The remaining vowels are I, O, U.

  The word ""IRONY"" covers two vowels (I and O) and Y (which can be vowel-like).

  Another good candidate: ""WRING"" tests W, I, G.

  But perhaps we should prioritize words that have letters that appear frequently in five-letter words.

  Since we have three unknown positions, we might try to get them all in one go.

  But note: if we guess a word that has R and N in the correct places, and if we get other letters correct, we might solve it faster.

  Let's think strategy: we have 5 remaining guesses? Actually, we have 5 more after the first (since total 6, we used 1). This is the second guess.

  We can choose a word that covers common vowels and consonants.

  I think ""BRINY"" is a reasonable choice: 
    Common letters: B, R, I, N, Y.
    We already know R and N are in the word and fixed. We are testing B, I, Y.

  Alternatively, ""TRUNK"" tests T, U, N, K. But we already know N is in.

  However, I recall that we also need to be cautious: if the unknown positions are consonants or vowels.

  Another popular choice might be ""PRINT"": P-R-I-N-T -> 
        Fourth letter is N? P-R-I-N-T -> positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes.
        Letters: P, R, I, N, T. T is a common consonant. But we haven't tested T.

  But note: T is not eliminated? We haven't tested T, so it's a good candidate.

  Similarly, ""GRINT"" is not a word? Let me check: not sure, but ""GRINT"" might not be valid. But ""GRIND"" we thought earlier.

  Actually, ""PRINT"" is a valid word: 
        We know the pattern is _ R _ N _, and ""PRINT"" is P-R-I-N-T -> fits.

  ""GRIND"" is G-R-I-N-D -> also fits.

  Now, comparing ""PRINT"" and ""BRINY"":
    Both test I at the third position. 
    ""PRINT"" tests P and T (T at fifth), while ""BRINY"" tests B and Y.

  Since T is more common than Y and P is common, ""PRINT"" might be better.

  But note: we have eliminated vowels A and E, so testing I and other vowels (O, U) is important.

  ""PRINT"" has vowels? I is a vowel. 

  So, which word gives the most information?

  We want to test letters that are likely to appear and haven't been eliminated.

  Let's list the available letters: excluding C, A, E.

  Common available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  But note: R and N are already in the word, but we know their positions.

  We are focusing on positions 1, 3, 5.

  Position 1: commonly T, S, B, P, ... 
  Position 3: commonly vowels (I, O, U) or consonants.
  Position 5: commonly T, S, D, Y, etc.

  So a word that includes a vowel (I, O, U) in position 3 would be good.

  Both ""IRONY"" and ""PRINT"" have I at position 3? 
    For ""PRINT"": P(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> I at third.
  ""IRONY"": I(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> O at third? Actually, third letter is O.

  Correction: ""IRONY"" is I-R-O-N-Y -> so third letter O.

  So ""PRINT"" has I at third and ""IRONY"" has O at third.

  We don't know which vowel is present? So choosing a word that uses one of these vowels might help.

  Another candidate: ""CRITH"" is not valid? 

  Considering we want to maximize new letters, I propose ""PRINT"" because:
    P and T are common letters that we haven't tested.

  But wait: we know R and N are in the word and correct, so if we guess ""PRINT"", we are testing:
    P at position 1: if it is correct we get ✓, else if it exists elsewhere we get -, or x.
    I at position 3: same, could be correct? 
    T at position 5: same.

  It's structured so that if the word is ""PRINT"", we win, else we get feedback on P, I, T.

  Similarly, with ""BRINY"" we test B, I, Y.

  Between common letters: T is more common than Y.

  However, we have not tested any of I, O, U vowels yet. Testing one (I or O) is important.

  Perhaps we can choose a word that uses O? For example, ""IRONY"" uses O at position 3.

  Since we have two vowels left (I, O, U), and we don't know which, testing one of them might help eliminate.

  But note: we have 5 tries left, we can test one vowel at a time.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that contains multiple vowels? But we have only one vowel slot (position 3) unless the word has vowels at other positions?

  Actually, position 1 and 5 can be vowels too? For example, ""OPERA"" but we don't know.

  But in our pattern _ R _ N _, the first or fifth could be vowels.

  Considering we don't know what the vowels are (apart from eliminating A and E), we should try to cover vowels.

  However, we are constrained by the pattern.

  Let me list words that fit the pattern: 
    Words we can try: 
      - PRINT (vowel I at third, tests P, T)
      - BRINY (vowel I at third, tests B, Y)
      - IRONY (vowel O at third, tests I, Y) -> wait, I at first and O at third.
      - TRUNK (vowel U at third, tests T, U, K)
      - GROIN (but does not have N at fourth) -> no.
      - BROWN (incorrect pattern) -> no.

  After looking, ""TRUNK"" might be a good choice because it tests U (vowel) and T, K. But U at position 3? Yes.

  How about ""FRONT"": F-R-O-N-T -> 
        Positions: F(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), T(5) -> matches, no eliminated letters? 
        Eliminated: we didn't test F, O, T. And O is a vowel.

  So ""FRONT"" tests F, O, T.

  It covers the vowel O and two common consonants (F and T).

  So from information perspective, ""FRONT"" uses O which we haven't tested (a vowel) and T which is common.

  It provides:
    F: at first position
    O: at third
    T: at fifth

  This seems efficient.

  Alternatively, ""CRWTH"" is not valid? 

  So among the candidates: 
    ""IRONY"", ""PRINT"", ""TRUNK"", ""BRINY"", ""FRONT"", ""GRIND""

  Let's decide:

  We want to choose a word that uses the pattern, avoids eliminated letters, and introduces new letters that are common.

  I think ""PRINT"" and ""FRONT"" are both strong.

  But note: the word cannot have E or A, so vowels are limited to I, O, U.

  Since we have more consonants to test, but vowels are critical. Testing O might be as good as testing I.

  However, let's consider frequency: 
    In five-letter words, E and A are the most common vowels, but we know they aren't present. So the next common vowels are O, I, U.

  O is more common than I and U? Not sure, but both should be tested.

  We are going to guess one word, so we pick one.

  I think I'll go with ""PRINT"" because:
    - It includes two very common consonants (P and T) and a vowel (I) in its typical position (vowels often in the middle).
    - The chance of I being present is significant.

  So my second guess is ""PRINT"".

  However, let me check: what if the word is ""FRONT""? Then by guessing ""PRINT"", we leave F and O untested.

  But we can only test so many letters per guess.

  Another candidate: ""POINT"": has O? P-O-I-N-T -> 
        Positions: P(1), O(2)? but we need second position R -> not possible.

  Only words with R in second and N in fourth.

  After reconsideration: ""FRONT"" might be better because:
    - It tests the vowel O (in the middle) and T (at the end).
    - Also tests F (less common but possible).

  And F is a common starting consonant? Not as common as others.

  Actually, T is a very common ending letter.

  Since the fifth position has T in many words, testing T at the end is good.

  So I'll switch to ""FRONT"".

  Final decision: ""FRONT"".

  Steps:
    We know: second letter R, fourth letter N, and not C, A, E.
    Guess ""FRONT"": 
        F at 1, R at 2, O at 3, N at 4, T at 5.

  If the feedback shows:
      - F is not in the word? We eliminate F.
      - O might be present or not? At position 3? If not, we eliminate O if it's not present.
      - T at end? Similarly.

  And R and N should be correct again.

  Using this, we can narrow down.

  So let's guess ""FRONT"".

<guess>front</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **R** is correct and in the second position (✓).
- **N** is correct and in the fourth position (✓).
- **C**, **A**, and **E** are not in the word (x).

The secret word follows the pattern: **\_ R \_ N \_**, with no C, A, or E. 

For the second guess:
- Prioritize high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., T, O, I, S, L).
- Focus on vowels (O, I, U) since A and E are eliminated.
- Ensure the guess fits the pattern **\_ R \_ N \_**.

**Analysis of candidates**:
- ""PRINT"": Tests P (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), T (common ending). Covers common consonants and a vowel.
- ""FRONT"": Tests F (position 1), O (vowel, position 3), T (position 5). Efficiently checks O and T.
- ""TRUNK"": Tests T (position 1), U (vowel, position 3), K (position 5). Good vowel/consonant balance.
- ""BRINY"": Tests B (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), Y (position 5). Less common letters.

**Chosen word**: ""FRONT""
- Reasons:
  - Tests **O** (key vowel candidate).
  - Uses **T** (common ending letter).
  - Maximizes new information with high-frequency letters.
  - Fits the pattern: **F** R **O** N **T**.

This guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.

I is a vowel. \n\n  So, which word gives the most information?\n\n  We want to test letters that are likely to appear and haven\'t been eliminated.\n\n  Let\'s list the available letters: excluding C, A, E.\n\n  Common available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n  But note: R and N are already in the word, but we know their positions.\n\n  We are focusing on positions 1, 3, 5.\n\n  Position 1: commonly T, S, B, P, ... \n  Position 3: commonly vowels (I, O, U) or consonants.\n  Position 5: commonly T, S, D, Y, etc.\n\n  So a word that includes a vowel (I, O, U) in position 3 would be good.\n\n  Both ""IRONY"" and ""PRINT"" have I at position 3? \n    For ""PRINT"": P(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> I at third.\n  ""IRONY"": I(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> O at third? Actually, third letter is O.\n\n  Correction: ""IRONY"" is I-R-O-N-Y -> so third letter O.\n\n  So ""PRINT"" has I at third and ""IRONY"" has O at third.\n\n  We don\'t know which vowel is present? So choosing a word that uses one of these vowels might help.\n\n  Another candidate: ""CRITH"" is not valid? \n\n  Considering we want to maximize new letters, I propose ""PRINT"" because:\n    P and T are common letters that we haven\'t tested.\n\n  But wait: we know R and N are in the word and correct, so if we guess ""PRINT"", we are testing:\n    P at position 1: if it is correct we get ✓, else if it exists elsewhere we get -, or x.\n    I at position 3: same, could be correct? \n    T at position 5: same.\n\n  It\'s structured so that if the word is ""PRINT"", we win, else we get feedback on P, I, T.\n\n  Similarly, with ""BRINY"" we test B, I, Y.\n\n  Between common letters: T is more common than Y.\n\n  However, we have not tested any of I, O, U vowels yet. Testing one (I or O) is important.\n\n  Perhaps we can choose a word that uses O? For example, ""IRONY"" uses O at position 3.\n\n  Since we have two vowels left (I, O, U), and we don\'t know which, testing one of them might help eliminate.\n\n  But note: we have 5 tries left, we can test one vowel at a time.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that contains multiple vowels? But we have only one vowel slot (position 3) unless the word has vowels at other positions?\n\n  Actually, position 1 and 5 can be vowels too? For example, ""OPERA"" but we don\'t know.\n\n  But in our pattern _ R _ N _, the first or fifth could be vowels.\n\n  Considering we don\'t know what the vowels are (apart from eliminating A and E), we should try to cover vowels.\n\n  However, we are constrained by the pattern.\n\n  Let me list words that fit the pattern: \n    Words we can try: \n      - PRINT (vowel I at third, tests P, T)\n      - BRINY (vowel I at third, tests B, Y)\n      - IRONY (vowel O at third, tests I, Y) -> wait, I at first and O at third.\n      - TRUNK (vowel U at third, tests T, U, K)\n      - GROIN (but does not have N at fourth) -> no.\n      - BROWN (incorrect pattern) -> no.\n\n  After looking, ""TRUNK"" might be a good choice because it tests U (vowel) and T, K. But U at position 3? Yes.\n\n  How about ""FRONT"": F-R-O-N-T -> \n        Positions: F(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), T(5) -> matches, no eliminated letters? \n        Eliminated: we didn\'t test F, O, T. And O is a vowel.\n\n  So ""FRONT"" tests F, O, T.\n\n  It covers the vowel O and two common consonants (F and T).\n\n  So from information perspective, ""FRONT"" uses O which we haven\'t tested (a vowel) and T which is common.\n\n  It provides:\n    F: at first position\n    O: at third\n    T: at fifth\n\n  This seems efficient.\n\n  Alternatively, ""CRWTH"" is not valid? \n\n  So among the candidates: \n    ""IRONY"", ""PRINT"", ""TRUNK"", ""BRINY"", ""FRONT"", ""GRIND""\n\n  Let\'s decide:\n\n  We want to choose a word that uses the pattern, avoids eliminated letters, and introduces new letters that are common.\n\n  I think ""PRINT"" and ""FRONT"" are both strong.\n\n  But note: the word cannot have E or A, so vowels are limited to I, O, U.\n\n  Since we have more consonants to test, but vowels are critical. Testing O might be as good as testing I.\n\n  However, let\'s consider frequency: \n    In five-letter words, E and A are the most common vowels, but we know they aren\'t present. So the next common vowels are O, I, U.\n\n  O is more common than I and U? Not sure, but both should be tested.\n\n  We are going to guess one word, so we pick one.\n\n  I think I\'ll go with ""PRINT"" because:\n    - It includes two very common consonants (P and T) and a vowel (I) in its typical position (vowels often in the middle).\n    - The chance of I being present is significant.\n\n  So my second guess is ""PRINT"".\n\n  However, let me check: what if the word is ""FRONT""? Then by guessing ""PRINT"", we leave F and O untested.\n\n  But we can only test so many letters per guess.\n\n  Another candidate: ""POINT"": has O? P-O-I-N-T -> \n        Positions: P(1), O(2)? but we need second position R -> not possible.\n\n  Only words with R in second and N in fourth.\n\n  After reconsideration: ""FRONT"" might be better because:\n    - It tests the vowel O (in the middle) and T (at the end).\n    - Also tests F (less common but possible).\n\n  And F is a common starting consonant? Not as common as others.\n\n  Actually, T is a very common ending letter.\n\n  Since the fifth position has T in many words, testing T at the end is good.\n\n  So I\'ll switch to ""FRONT"".\n\n  Final decision: ""FRONT"".\n\n  Steps:\n    We know: second letter R, fourth letter N, and not C, A, E.\n    Guess ""FRONT"": \n        F at 1, R at 2, O at 3, N at 4, T at 5.\n\n  If the feedback shows:\n      - F is not in the word? We eliminate F.\n      - O might be present or not? At position 3? If not, we eliminate O if it\'s not present.\n      - T at end? Similarly.\n\n  And R and N should be correct again.\n\n  Using this, we can narrow down.\n\n  So let\'s guess ""FRONT"".\n\n<guess>front</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- **R** is correct and in the second position (✓).\n- **N** is correct and in the fourth position (✓).\n- **C**, **A**, and **E** are not in the word (x).\n\nThe secret word follows the pattern: **\\_ R \\_ N \\_**, with no C, A, or E. \n\nFor the second guess:\n- Prioritize high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., T, O, I, S, L).\n- Focus on vowels (O, I, U) since A and E are eliminated.\n- Ensure the guess fits the pattern **\\_ R \\_ N \\_**.\n\n**Analysis of candidates**:\n- ""PRINT"": Tests P (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), T (common ending).

Efficiently checks O and T.\n- ""TRUNK"": Tests T (position 1), U (vowel, position 3), K (position 5). Good vowel/consonant balance.\n- ""BRINY"": Tests B (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), Y (position 5). Less common letters.\n\n**Chosen word**: ""FRONT""\n- Reasons:\n  - Tests **O** (key vowel candidate).\n  - Uses **T** (common ending letter).\n  - Maximizes new information with high-frequency letters.\n  - Fits the pattern: **F** R **O** N **T**.\n\nThis guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.\n\n<guess>front</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: front -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: ✓ (correct position, so fourth letter is N)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""front""
  F: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R)
  O: x (not in the word)
  N: ✓ (correct position, fourth letter N)
  T: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The word has the form: _ R _ N _
- Letters that are not in the word: C, A, E, F, O, T
- Therefore, eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
  - Second letter is R
  - Fourth letter is N
  - Does not contain C, A, E, F, O, T

The remaining letters to use are from the alphabet excluding these. We should focus on common letters that haven't been tested.

Available letters (consonants and vowels): 
  B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: we have not tested any vowels except A, E, O (which are eliminated) and we haven't tested I, U, Y (which can be vowels). Since A, E, O are out, the word must contain one of I, U, or Y (or sometimes W, but less common) as a vowel.

The pattern: [1] R [3] N [5]

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters from the available set, and the word must be valid.

Let's think of common words that fit:

- Position 3: This is often a vowel. Since A, E, O are out, likely I, U, or Y (if Y is used as a vowel). But Y can also be a consonant.

Possible words:

  - ""BRING"": B-R-I-N-G -> 
        B at 1, R at 2, I at 3, N at 4, G at 5.
        Check letters: B, I, G are not eliminated? 
        Eliminated: C,A,E,F,O,T. So B, I, G are allowed.

  - ""DRINK"": D-R-I-N-K -> D, I, K are allowed.

  - ""PRINK"": P-R-I-N-K -> P, I, K allowed? But ""PRINK"" is a word? (meaning: to dress or adorn in a showy manner) - valid.

  - ""WRING"": W-R-I-N-G -> W, I, G allowed.

  - ""GRIND"": G-R-I-N-D -> G, I, D allowed.

  - ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> B, I, Y allowed. But we tried Y? Not yet.

  - ""CRIMP"": but C is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""TRIPY"": T is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""URBAN"": but A is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""URINE"": E is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""DRUNK"": D-R-U-N-K -> U is allowed? Yes, and D, K allowed.

  - ""GRUNT"": T is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""BRUNT"": T eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""PRUNE"": E eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""CRONE"": C and E eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""IRONY"": I-R-O-N-Y -> but O is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""CRWTH"": not a common word and C eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""MYRRH"": M-Y-R-R-H -> but the pattern: second letter is Y? We need second letter R. This is M(1), Y(2) -> not R at second. Also, it has two R's? But we know the word has R at second, but it might have another R? However, the feedback for ""crane"" had R correct at second, but if there was another R, it would have been marked as present? 

    Recall: in ""crane"", we had R at second correct, and no other R was indicated? But the feedback only marks the first occurrence? Actually, Wordle rules: if there are duplicate letters, it can be tricky. But in this case, since we have R at second and it was marked correct, if there is another R, it would be marked as present if it is in the word but in the wrong position? But in ""crane"", we only have one R. Similarly, in ""front"", we had one R and it was correct.

    However, the secret word might have two R's? But in the feedback for ""crane"", if there was a second R, and it was in the word but not in the position of the R in ""crane"", it would have been marked with a dash? But in ""crane"", we only have one R, and it was correct, so that R is accounted for. If the word has another R, then when we guessed ""crane"", the feedback would have shown the second R as present? But we didn't have a second R in the guess. Similarly, in ""front"", we only have one R and it was correct. So if the word has a second R, it hasn't been revealed yet.

    But in our pattern, we have positions: 1, 3, 5 to fill. If we put R in one of those, it would be a second R. But the feedback from ""crane"" didn't show any other R? Actually, we don't know because we only had one R in the guess. So it's possible that the word has only one R, or it has two but we haven't guessed a word with R in another position.

    However, to be safe, we should not assume there is only one R. But for now, we can consider words with or without duplicate R.

    But in the words above, ""MYRRH"" doesn't fit the pattern because the second letter is Y, not R.

  - ""BORNE"": O and E eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""HORNY"": O eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""MOURN"": O and U? M-O-U-R-N -> pattern: M(1), O(2) -> but we need R at second? So no.

  - ""PURIN"": P-U-R-I-N -> but pattern: P(1), U(2)? We need R at second. So no.

  - ""RUING"": R-U-I-N-G -> but then second letter is U? We need R at second. So no.

  - ""WRUNG"": W-R-U-N-G -> W(1), R(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> fits. Letters: W, U, G allowed.

  - ""BRUNG"": not standard? ""Brung"" is not a valid word; the past participle of bring is brought, but sometimes used informally. Avoid.

  - ""DRUNG"": not a word.

  - ""GRUNG"": not a word.

  - ""TRUSS"": T eliminated -> invalid.

So our main candidates are:
  - ""BRING"": tests B, I, G
  - ""DRINK"": tests D, I, K
  - ""PRINK"": tests P, I, K (but less common word)
  - ""WRING"": tests W, I, G
  - ""GRIND"": tests G, I, D
  - ""DRUNK"": tests D, U, K
  - ""WRUNG"": tests W, U, G

We need to choose one that maximizes information. Since we have eliminated many letters, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Note: We haven't tested I, U, Y (vowels) and many consonants.

We should prioritize testing a vowel (I or U) because if we can confirm or eliminate a vowel, it will help a lot.

Also, we have position 3 which is likely a vowel.

So, let's choose a word that has a vowel at position 3.

All the above candidates have either I or U at position 3.

Now, which one to pick? We can also consider the frequency.

I is more common than U in English words.

But we have two vowels left: I and U (Y is also possible, but less common as a vowel in the middle).

We can test I first.

So, among the words with I at position 3: ""BRING"", ""DRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRING"", ""GRIND""

We can avoid ""PRINK"" because it's obscure.

""BRING"" and ""WRING"" both have G at the end. ""DRINK"" has K at the end. ""GRIND"" has D at the end.

We might choose ""DRINK"" because it tests D and K, which are common.

But note: we have position 5 to fill. Common ending letters: we have eliminated T, so other common endings are D, S, Y, etc. But S hasn't been tested? We haven't tested S.

We haven't tested S! That's a very common letter.

Is there a word that fits the pattern and has S?

For example:
  - ""URNS"" is 4 letters.
  - ""BRINS"" not a word.
  - ""GRINS"": G-R-I-N-S -> G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> yes! ""GRINS"" is a word (third person singular of grin).
        Letters: G, I, S. All allowed.

  - ""PRINS"" not a word? Prince without e? No.
  - ""DRINS"" not a word.
  - ""WRENS"": W-R-E-N-S -> but E is eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""BRANS"": A eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""TRONS"": T and O eliminated -> invalid.

So ""GRINS"" is a candidate: G-R-I-N-S.

Similarly, ""GRIND"" is G-R-I-N-D.

Now, S is a very common ending letter, so testing S is valuable.

Therefore, ""GRINS"" is a good candidate because:
  - It tests G at position 1, I at position 3, and S at position 5.
  - S is a new high-frequency letter.

Alternatively, we could test U with a word that has S? But ""WRUNG"" has G, not S.

Is there a word with U and S? 
  - ""URNS"" is 4 letters.
  - ""RUNGS"": R-U-N-G-S -> but pattern: R(1)? We need first letter to be something, then R at second? This would be R at first, not second. So no.
  - ""RUSKS"": R at first -> no.
  - ""BRUSK"": not a word? Or variant of brusque? But spelled with E? Not 5 letters with this pattern.

So no good word with U and S that fits the pattern.

Therefore, we can choose ""GRINS"" to test I and S.

But note: we have ""GRINS"" and ""GRIND"". Both test G and I. The difference is the last letter: S vs D.

Since S is more common, we prefer ""GRINS"".

Another candidate: ""PRISM"": P-R-I-S-M -> but fourth letter is S, not N -> doesn't match.

So, I think ""GRINS"" is a strong candidate.

But let's check if there are other words with S:

  - ""CRISP"": C eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""TRIPS"": T eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""DRIPS"": D-R-I-P-S -> but fourth letter is P? Not N -> no.

So ""GRINS"" seems good.

We could also consider ""BRISK"": but S is at fourth? B-R-I-S-K -> fourth is S, not N -> no.

Therefore, I choose ""GRINS"".

But wait: what about ""BRING""? It doesn't have S, but it's a common word. However, we want to test S.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests U? But without S.

But if we test U and it's not present, we still have to test S later. So testing S now might be better.

We have 4 guesses left? We used 2, so 4 left. We can test U later if needed.

So, let's go with ""GRINS"".

Guess: ""GRINS""

But note: we are not sure if I is in the word. If we guess ""GRINS"", we might get information about I and S.

If I is not in the word, then we know the vowel must be U.

So, we can do:

  Guess 3: ""GRINS""

  If I is present and in the correct position? Then we have _ R I N _ and we know the word is ?RIN? and we have to find the first and last.

  If I is not present, then we know the vowel is U, so we can look for words with U at position 3.

But note: the word might have Y as a vowel? For example, ""CRYPT"" but C and T eliminated. Or ""TRYST"" T eliminated. So less likely.

So, ""GRINS"" is a good guess.

Another candidate: ""BRINK"" -> B-R-I-N-K, but we haven't tested K. But S is more common than K.

I think ""GRINS"" is better.

So, I'll go with ""GRINS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ R _ N _` (R in position 2, N in position 4).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, E, F, O, T (not in the word at all).
- **Untested letters**: Focus on high-frequency consonants (B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, U, W, Y) and vowels (I, U, Y).

### Analysis for Guess 3:
- **Position 3 is likely a vowel** (since A, E, O are eliminated, I or U are prime candidates).
- **Position 5 often ends with common consonants** like S, D, or Y (T is eliminated).
- **Key strategy**: Test new high-frequency letters, especially S (most common unused consonant) and I (common vowel), to maximize information.

**Top candidate words**:
- **GRINS**: Fits the pattern (`G R I N S`), tests G (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), and S (position 5). S is highly frequent and untested.
- Alternatives like ""DRINK"" (tests D, I, K) or ""WRUNG"" (tests W, U, G) were considered, but ""GRINS"" is stronger because:
  - Tests S (more common than K or U).
  - If I is correct, it confirms the vowel; if not, U becomes the primary vowel candidate.
  - Avoids obscure words (e.g., ""PRINK"" is less common).

**Chosen word**: **GRINS**  
- Tests 3 new letters (G, I, S), with high coverage of likely vowels and endings.
- If feedback shows I or S is present, it significantly narrows possibilities (e.g., `_ R I N _` or `_ R _ N S`).

  - ""HORNY"": O eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""MOURN"": O and U? M-O-U-R-N -> pattern: M(1), O(2) -> but we need R at second? So no.

  - ""PURIN"": P-U-R-I-N -> but pattern: P(1), U(2)? We need R at second. So no.

  - ""RUING"": R-U-I-N-G -> but then second letter is U? We need R at second. So no.

  - ""WRUNG"": W-R-U-N-G -> W(1), R(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> fits. Letters: W, U, G allowed.

  - ""BRUNG"": not standard? ""Brung"" is not a valid word; the past participle of bring is brought, but sometimes used informally. Avoid.

  - ""DRUNG"": not a word.

  - ""GRUNG"": not a word.

  - ""TRUSS"": T eliminated -> invalid.

So our main candidates are:
  - ""BRING"": tests B, I, G
  - ""DRINK"": tests D, I, K
  - ""PRINK"": tests P, I, K (but less common word)
  - ""WRING"": tests W, I, G
  - ""GRIND"": tests G, I, D
  - ""DRUNK"": tests D, U, K
  - ""WRUNG"": tests W, U, G

We need to choose one that maximizes information. Since we have eliminated many letters, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Note: We haven't tested I, U, Y (vowels) and many consonants.

We should prioritize testing a vowel (I or U) because if we can confirm or eliminate a vowel, it will help a lot.

Also, we have position 3 which is likely a vowel.

So, let's choose a word that has a vowel at position 3.

All the above candidates have either I or U at position 3.

Now, which one to pick? We can also consider the frequency.

I is more common than U in English words.

But we have two vowels left: I and U (Y is also possible, but less common as a vowel in the middle).

We can test I first.

So, among the words with I at position 3: ""BRING"", ""DRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRING"", ""GRIND""

We can avoid ""PRINK"" because it's obscure.

""BRING"" and ""WRING"" both have G at the end. ""DRINK"" has K at the end. ""GRIND"" has D at the end.

We might choose ""DRINK"" because it tests D and K, which are common.

But note: we have position 5 to fill. Common ending letters: we have eliminated T, so other common endings are D, S, Y, etc. But S hasn't been tested? We haven't tested S.

We haven't tested S! That's a very common letter.

Is there a word that fits the pattern and has S?

For example:
  - ""URNS"" is 4 letters.
  - ""BRINS"" not a word.
  - ""GRINS"": G-R-I-N-S -> G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> yes! ""GRINS"" is a word (third person singular of grin).
        Letters: G, I, S. All allowed.

  - ""PRINS"" not a word? Prince without e? No.
  - ""DRINS"" not a word.
  - ""WRENS"": W-R-E-N-S -> but E is eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""BRANS"": A eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""TRONS"": T and O eliminated -> invalid.

So ""GRINS"" is a candidate: G-R-I-N-S.

Similarly, ""GRIND"" is G-R-I-N-D.

Now, S is a very common ending letter, so testing S is valuable.

Therefore, ""GRINS"" is a good candidate because:
  - It tests G at position 1, I at position 3, and S at position 5.
  - S is a new high-frequency letter.

Alternatively, we could test U with a word that has S? But ""WRUNG"" has G, not S.

Is there a word with U and S? 
  - ""URNS"" is 4 letters.
  - ""RUNGS"": R-U-N-G-S -> but pattern: R(1)? We need first letter to be something, then R at second? This would be R at first, not second. So no.
  - ""RUSKS"": R at first -> no.
  - ""BRUSK"": not a word? Or variant of brusque? But spelled with E? Not 5 letters with this pattern.

So no good word with U and S that fits the pattern.

Therefore, we can choose ""GRINS"" to test I and S.

But note: we have ""GRINS"" and ""GRIND"". Both test G and I. The difference is the last letter: S vs D.

Since S is more common, we prefer ""GRINS"".

Another candidate: ""PRISM"": P-R-I-S-M -> but fourth letter is S, not N -> doesn't match.

So, I think ""GRINS"" is a strong candidate.

But let's check if there are other words with S:

  - ""CRISP"": C eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""TRIPS"": T eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""DRIPS"": D-R-I-P-S -> but fourth letter is P? Not N -> no.

So ""GRINS"" seems good.

We could also consider ""BRISK"": but S is at fourth? B-R-I-S-K -> fourth is S, not N -> no.

Therefore, I choose ""GRINS"".

But wait: what about ""BRING""? It doesn't have S, but it's a common word. However, we want to test S.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests U? But without S.

But if we test U and it's not present, we still have to test S later. So testing S now might be better.

We have 4 guesses left? We used 2, so 4 left. We can test U later if needed.

So, let's go with ""GRINS"".

Guess: ""GRINS""

But note: we are not sure if I is in the word. If we guess ""GRINS"", we might get information about I and S.

If I is not in the word, then we know the vowel must be U.

So, we can do:

  Guess 3: ""GRINS""

  If I is present and in the correct position? Then we have _ R I N _ and we know the word is ?RIN? and we have to find the first and last.

  If I is not present, then we know the vowel is U, so we can look for words with U at position 3.

But note: the word might have Y as a vowel? For example, ""CRYPT"" but C and T eliminated. Or ""TRYST"" T eliminated. So less likely.

So, ""GRINS"" is a good guess.

Another candidate: ""BRINK"" -> B-R-I-N-K, but we haven't tested K. But S is more common than K.

I think ""GRINS"" is better.

So, I'll go with ""GRINS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ R _ N _` (R in position 2, N in position 4).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, E, F, O, T (not in the word at all).
- **Untested letters**: Focus on high-frequency consonants (B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, U, W, Y) and vowels (I, U, Y).

### Analysis for Guess 3:
- **Position 3 is likely a vowel** (since A, E, O are eliminated, I or U are prime candidates).
- **Position 5 often ends with common consonants** like S, D, or Y (T is eliminated).
- **Key strategy**: Test new high-frequency letters, especially S (most common unused consonant) and I (common vowel), to maximize information.

**Top candidate words**:
- **GRINS**: Fits the pattern (`G R I N S`), tests G (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), and S (position 5). S is highly frequent and untested.
- Alternatives like ""DRINK"" (tests D, I, K) or ""WRUNG"" (tests W, U, G) were considered, but ""GRINS"" is stronger because:
  - Tests S (more common than K or U).
  - If I is correct, it confirms the vowel; if not, U becomes the primary vowel candidate.
  - Avoids obscure words (e.g., ""PRINK"" is less common).

**Chosen word**: **GRINS**  
- Tests 3 new letters (G, I, S), with high coverage of likely vowels and endings.
- If feedback shows I or S is present, it significantly narrows possibilities (e.g., `_ R I N _` or `_ R _ N S`).",Guess 3: grins -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) S(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.
 The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:
   - It contains 'R', 'O', 'A', 'S', 'T' — all common letters.
   - It has two vowels ('O' and 'A') and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let's go with ""ROAST"" for now.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we might avoid repeating those.

 Another popular choice is ""ADIEU"" because it has many vowels, but it has only one common consonant. We want to maximize information.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a very good starting word because:
   - It has three consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - The letters C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common.

 But let me check: the word ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a strong starter.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these is fine. I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I need to make the first guess in this Wordle-like game. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good starter typically includes common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to cover frequent patterns. 

After considering options:
- **Common letters**: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C are among the most frequent in English.
- **Vowel coverage**: Including at least two vowels (like A and E) helps test critical positions.
- **Avoid repeats**: Using distinct letters increases the chance of hitting multiple matches.

Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ROAST"" are strong candidates. I'll choose **""CRANE""** because:
- It contains 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E).
- All letters are distinct, covering 5 unique high-frequency characters.
- It avoids rare letters (like J, Q, Z) and positions vowels flexibly.

This guess should provide useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent turns.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the fourth letter)
  E: x (not in the word)

 Therefore, we know:
  - The word has R in the second position and N in the fourth position.
  - The letters C, A, E are not in the word at all.

 The secret word has the form: _ R _ N _

 Since C, A, and E are eliminated, we must choose a word that:
  - Has the second letter R and the fourth letter N.
  - Contains no C, A, or E.

 We also know that the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of letters that can be in the first, third, and fifth positions.

 Remember, we have 5 more guesses (this is the second of 6), so we want to maximize information.

 Since we know two letters (R and N) and their positions, we can try to fill the other positions with common letters that are not eliminated.

 Eliminated letters: C, A, E.

 The word structure: [letter1] R [letter3] N [letter5]

 We should try to use common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as T, L, S, O, I, etc.

 For example, common words matching this pattern: 
  - ""IRONy"" but that's 5 letters? Actually, ""IRONY"" is 5 letters: I-R-O-N-Y -> positions: I in first, R second, O third, N fourth, Y fifth.

 But let's check: are there other possibilities? We need to avoid A, C, E.

 Other examples:
  - ""URBAN"": U-R-B-A-N -> but A is eliminated, so invalid because of A? Wait, the word cannot have A because of the feedback.
    Actually, the feedback said A is not in the word, so ""URBAN"" has A -> invalid.

  - ""CROWN"": has C? C is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""BROWN"": B-R-O-W-N -> 
      First letter: B (not eliminated)
      Third: O
      Fourth: N (known)
      Fifth: N? No, fifth is N? Wait, the word is B-R-O-W-N, so fifth is N? Actually, no: B (1), R (2), O (3), W (4)? No, wait: positions:
        B (1), R (2), O (3), W (4), N (5) -> so fourth is W, not N -> but we need fourth to be N? So this doesn't match.

  We need the fourth letter to be N.

  Correct pattern: _ R _ N _

  So in ""BROWN"", the N is fifth, so not matching.

  Let's think of words ending with N? Actually, the fourth position is N, so the word ends with something? It's _ R _ N _

  So the last letter can be anything.

  Words: 
    ""HORNS"": H-R (then O?): H (1), R (2), O (3), N (4)? Then S (5). Wait, H-R-O-N-S -> but the fourth is O? No: 
        Position 1: H
        Position 2: R
        Position 3: O
        Position 4: N -> wait, that would be ... let me spell: H-O-R-N-S? That's not right. Actually, ""HORNS"" is H-O-R-N-S? 
        But we need R in second and N in fourth. In ""HORNS"":
          H at pos1, O at pos2, R at pos3, N at pos4? Then S at pos5 -> but that would be: H O R N S -> so second letter is O, not R. So no.

  Alternatively, let's list words that have second letter R and fourth letter N.

  Some candidate words:
    ""IRONY"": I-R-O-N-Y -> 
      I at 1, R at 2, O at 3, N at 4, Y at 5 -> matches pattern and no A, C, E -> valid candidate.

    ""URINE"": U-R-I-N-E -> but E is eliminated -> invalid.

    ""TREND"": T-R-E-N-D -> E is eliminated -> invalid.

    ""GRIND"": G-R-I-N-D -> 
        Fourth letter is N? G-R-I-N-D -> positions: G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) -> so yes.
        Letters: G, R, I, N, D. Eliminated letters: C, A, E. So G, I, D are not eliminated? We don't have feedback on them yet.

    ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5) -> no eliminated letters.

    ""PRION"": P-R-I-O-N -> P(1), R(2), I(3), O(4)? Wait, O is fourth? Then N fifth? So structure: P-R-I-O-N -> fourth is O? Not N -> no.

    ""CRONY"": C-R-O-N-Y -> but C is eliminated -> invalid.

    ""GROIN"": G-R-O-I-N -> 
        G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), N(5) -> fourth letter is I, not N -> no.

  Wait, note: we need fourth letter N, so the word must have N at the fourth position.

  Another one: ""WRING"": W-R-I-N-G -> W(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> valid? Letters: W, I, G are not eliminated.

  ""TRUNK"": T-R-U-N-K -> T(1), R(2), U(3), N(4), K(5) -> U and T, K? Not eliminated.

  ""BRINK"": B-R-I-N-K -> B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> valid.

  But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible to gather more information.

  Best candidates: 
    ""IRONY"", ""GRIND"", ""BRINY"", ""WRING"", ""TRUNK"", ""BRINK""

  We also note that the first guess eliminated A, C, E, so we avoid those.

  Now, we have two correct positions: R at 2 and N at 4. The other positions (1, 3, 5) are unknown.

  We want to maximize information: so we should try to include letters that are common and that we haven't tried.

  In the first guess we tried C, R, A, N, E. So we have feedback on R and N (correct), and eliminated C, A, E.

  For the next guess, we can choose a word that has:
    - Second letter R, fourth letter N.
    - Other positions: use common letters not tested yet, such as T, O, I, S, L, B, D, etc.

  Since we have many candidates, let's pick one that covers multiple possibilities.

  Note: we must avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, E.

  Let's choose ""BRINY"":
    B: not tested
    R: known correct
    I: not tested
    N: known correct
    Y: not tested

  Alternatively, ""TRUNK"" would test T, U, K.

  We might also consider ""IRONY"": I, O, Y are new.

  However, we know that the first guess had A and E eliminated, which are vowels. So we should test other vowels? The remaining vowels are I, O, U.

  The word ""IRONY"" covers two vowels (I and O) and Y (which can be vowel-like).

  Another good candidate: ""WRING"" tests W, I, G.

  But perhaps we should prioritize words that have letters that appear frequently in five-letter words.

  Since we have three unknown positions, we might try to get them all in one go.

  But note: if we guess a word that has R and N in the correct places, and if we get other letters correct, we might solve it faster.

  Let's think strategy: we have 5 remaining guesses? Actually, we have 5 more after the first (since total 6, we used 1). This is the second guess.

  We can choose a word that covers common vowels and consonants.

  I think ""BRINY"" is a reasonable choice: 
    Common letters: B, R, I, N, Y.
    We already know R and N are in the word and fixed. We are testing B, I, Y.

  Alternatively, ""TRUNK"" tests T, U, N, K. But we already know N is in.

  However, I recall that we also need to be cautious: if the unknown positions are consonants or vowels.

  Another popular choice might be ""PRINT"": P-R-I-N-T -> 
        Fourth letter is N? P-R-I-N-T -> positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes.
        Letters: P, R, I, N, T. T is a common consonant. But we haven't tested T.

  But note: T is not eliminated? We haven't tested T, so it's a good candidate.

  Similarly, ""GRINT"" is not a word? Let me check: not sure, but ""GRINT"" might not be valid. But ""GRIND"" we thought earlier.

  Actually, ""PRINT"" is a valid word: 
        We know the pattern is _ R _ N _, and ""PRINT"" is P-R-I-N-T -> fits.

  ""GRIND"" is G-R-I-N-D -> also fits.

  Now, comparing ""PRINT"" and ""BRINY"":
    Both test I at the third position. 
    ""PRINT"" tests P and T (T at fifth), while ""BRINY"" tests B and Y.

  Since T is more common than Y and P is common, ""PRINT"" might be better.

  But note: we have eliminated vowels A and E, so testing I and other vowels (O, U) is important.

  ""PRINT"" has vowels? I is a vowel. 

  So, which word gives the most information?

  We want to test letters that are likely to appear and haven't been eliminated.

  Let's list the available letters: excluding C, A, E.

  Common available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  But note: R and N are already in the word, but we know their positions.

  We are focusing on positions 1, 3, 5.

  Position 1: commonly T, S, B, P, ... 
  Position 3: commonly vowels (I, O, U) or consonants.
  Position 5: commonly T, S, D, Y, etc.

  So a word that includes a vowel (I, O, U) in position 3 would be good.

  Both ""IRONY"" and ""PRINT"" have I at position 3? 
    For ""PRINT"": P(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> I at third.
  ""IRONY"": I(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> O at third? Actually, third letter is O.

  Correction: ""IRONY"" is I-R-O-N-Y -> so third letter O.

  So ""PRINT"" has I at third and ""IRONY"" has O at third.

  We don't know which vowel is present? So choosing a word that uses one of these vowels might help.

  Another candidate: ""CRITH"" is not valid? 

  Considering we want to maximize new letters, I propose ""PRINT"" because:
    P and T are common letters that we haven't tested.

  But wait: we know R and N are in the word and correct, so if we guess ""PRINT"", we are testing:
    P at position 1: if it is correct we get ✓, else if it exists elsewhere we get -, or x.
    I at position 3: same, could be correct? 
    T at position 5: same.

  It's structured so that if the word is ""PRINT"", we win, else we get feedback on P, I, T.

  Similarly, with ""BRINY"" we test B, I, Y.

  Between common letters: T is more common than Y.

  However, we have not tested any of I, O, U vowels yet. Testing one (I or O) is important.

  Perhaps we can choose a word that uses O? For example, ""IRONY"" uses O at position 3.

  Since we have two vowels left (I, O, U), and we don't know which, testing one of them might help eliminate.

  But note: we have 5 tries left, we can test one vowel at a time.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that contains multiple vowels? But we have only one vowel slot (position 3) unless the word has vowels at other positions?

  Actually, position 1 and 5 can be vowels too? For example, ""OPERA"" but we don't know.

  But in our pattern _ R _ N _, the first or fifth could be vowels.

  Considering we don't know what the vowels are (apart from eliminating A and E), we should try to cover vowels.

  However, we are constrained by the pattern.

  Let me list words that fit the pattern: 
    Words we can try: 
      - PRINT (vowel I at third, tests P, T)
      - BRINY (vowel I at third, tests B, Y)
      - IRONY (vowel O at third, tests I, Y) -> wait, I at first and O at third.
      - TRUNK (vowel U at third, tests T, U, K)
      - GROIN (but does not have N at fourth) -> no.
      - BROWN (incorrect pattern) -> no.

  After looking, ""TRUNK"" might be a good choice because it tests U (vowel) and T, K. But U at position 3? Yes.

  How about ""FRONT"": F-R-O-N-T -> 
        Positions: F(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), T(5) -> matches, no eliminated letters? 
        Eliminated: we didn't test F, O, T. And O is a vowel.

  So ""FRONT"" tests F, O, T.

  It covers the vowel O and two common consonants (F and T).

  So from information perspective, ""FRONT"" uses O which we haven't tested (a vowel) and T which is common.

  It provides:
    F: at first position
    O: at third
    T: at fifth

  This seems efficient.

  Alternatively, ""CRWTH"" is not valid? 

  So among the candidates: 
    ""IRONY"", ""PRINT"", ""TRUNK"", ""BRINY"", ""FRONT"", ""GRIND""

  Let's decide:

  We want to choose a word that uses the pattern, avoids eliminated letters, and introduces new letters that are common.

  I think ""PRINT"" and ""FRONT"" are both strong.

  But note: the word cannot have E or A, so vowels are limited to I, O, U.

  Since we have more consonants to test, but vowels are critical. Testing O might be as good as testing I.

  However, let's consider frequency: 
    In five-letter words, E and A are the most common vowels, but we know they aren't present. So the next common vowels are O, I, U.

  O is more common than I and U? Not sure, but both should be tested.

  We are going to guess one word, so we pick one.

  I think I'll go with ""PRINT"" because:
    - It includes two very common consonants (P and T) and a vowel (I) in its typical position (vowels often in the middle).
    - The chance of I being present is significant.

  So my second guess is ""PRINT"".

  However, let me check: what if the word is ""FRONT""? Then by guessing ""PRINT"", we leave F and O untested.

  But we can only test so many letters per guess.

  Another candidate: ""POINT"": has O? P-O-I-N-T -> 
        Positions: P(1), O(2)? but we need second position R -> not possible.

  Only words with R in second and N in fourth.

  After reconsideration: ""FRONT"" might be better because:
    - It tests the vowel O (in the middle) and T (at the end).
    - Also tests F (less common but possible).

  And F is a common starting consonant? Not as common as others.

  Actually, T is a very common ending letter.

  Since the fifth position has T in many words, testing T at the end is good.

  So I'll switch to ""FRONT"".

  Final decision: ""FRONT"".

  Steps:
    We know: second letter R, fourth letter N, and not C, A, E.
    Guess ""FRONT"": 
        F at 1, R at 2, O at 3, N at 4, T at 5.

  If the feedback shows:
      - F is not in the word? We eliminate F.
      - O might be present or not? At position 3? If not, we eliminate O if it's not present.
      - T at end? Similarly.

  And R and N should be correct again.

  Using this, we can narrow down.

  So let's guess ""FRONT"".

<guess>front</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **R** is correct and in the second position (✓).
- **N** is correct and in the fourth position (✓).
- **C**, **A**, and **E** are not in the word (x).

The secret word follows the pattern: **\_ R \_ N \_**, with no C, A, or E. 

For the second guess:
- Prioritize high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., T, O, I, S, L).
- Focus on vowels (O, I, U) since A and E are eliminated.
- Ensure the guess fits the pattern **\_ R \_ N \_**.

**Analysis of candidates**:
- ""PRINT"": Tests P (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), T (common ending). Covers common consonants and a vowel.
- ""FRONT"": Tests F (position 1), O (vowel, position 3), T (position 5). Efficiently checks O and T.
- ""TRUNK"": Tests T (position 1), U (vowel, position 3), K (position 5). Good vowel/consonant balance.
- ""BRINY"": Tests B (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), Y (position 5). Less common letters.

**Chosen word**: ""FRONT""
- Reasons:
  - Tests **O** (key vowel candidate).
  - Uses **T** (common ending letter).
  - Maximizes new information with high-frequency letters.
  - Fits the pattern: **F** R **O** N **T**.

This guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: front -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: ✓ (correct position, so fourth letter is N)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""front""
  F: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R)
  O: x (not in the word)
  N: ✓ (correct position, fourth letter N)
  T: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The word has the form: _ R _ N _
- Letters that are not in the word: C, A, E, F, O, T
- Therefore, eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
  - Second letter is R
  - Fourth letter is N
  - Does not contain C, A, E, F, O, T

The remaining letters to use are from the alphabet excluding these. We should focus on common letters that haven't been tested.

Available letters (consonants and vowels): 
  B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: we have not tested any vowels except A, E, O (which are eliminated) and we haven't tested I, U, Y (which can be vowels). Since A, E, O are out, the word must contain one of I, U, or Y (or sometimes W, but less common) as a vowel.

The pattern: [1] R [3] N [5]

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters from the available set, and the word must be valid.

Let's think of common words that fit:

- Position 3: This is often a vowel. Since A, E, O are out, likely I, U, or Y (if Y is used as a vowel). But Y can also be a consonant.

Possible words:

  - ""BRING"": B-R-I-N-G -> 
        B at 1, R at 2, I at 3, N at 4, G at 5.
        Check letters: B, I, G are not eliminated? 
        Eliminated: C,A,E,F,O,T. So B, I, G are allowed.

  - ""DRINK"": D-R-I-N-K -> D, I, K are allowed.

  - ""PRINK"": P-R-I-N-K -> P, I, K allowed? But ""PRINK"" is a word? (meaning: to dress or adorn in a showy manner) - valid.

  - ""WRING"": W-R-I-N-G -> W, I, G allowed.

  - ""GRIND"": G-R-I-N-D -> G, I, D allowed.

  - ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> B, I, Y allowed. But we tried Y? Not yet.

  - ""CRIMP"": but C is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""TRIPY"": T is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""URBAN"": but A is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""URINE"": E is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""DRUNK"": D-R-U-N-K -> U is allowed? Yes, and D, K allowed.

  - ""GRUNT"": T is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""BRUNT"": T eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""PRUNE"": E eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""CRONE"": C and E eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""IRONY"": I-R-O-N-Y -> but O is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""CRWTH"": not a common word and C eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""MYRRH"": M-Y-R-R-H -> but the pattern: second letter is Y? We need second letter R. This is M(1), Y(2) -> not R at second. Also, it has two R's? But we know the word has R at second, but it might have another R? However, the feedback for ""crane"" had R correct at second, but if there was another R, it would have been marked as present? 

    Recall: in ""crane"", we had R at second correct, and no other R was indicated? But the feedback only marks the first occurrence? Actually, Wordle rules: if there are duplicate letters, it can be tricky. But in this case, since we have R at second and it was marked correct, if there is another R, it would be marked as present if it is in the word but in the wrong position? But in ""crane"", we only have one R. Similarly, in ""front"", we had one R and it was correct.

    However, the secret word might have two R's? But in the feedback for ""crane"", if there was a second R, and it was in the word but not in the position of the R in ""crane"", it would have been marked with a dash? But in ""crane"", we only have one R, and it was correct, so that R is accounted for. If the word has another R, then when we guessed ""crane"", the feedback would have shown the second R as present? But we didn't have a second R in the guess. Similarly, in ""front"", we only have one R and it was correct. So if the word has a second R, it hasn't been revealed yet.

    But in our pattern, we have positions: 1, 3, 5 to fill. If we put R in one of those, it would be a second R. But the feedback from ""crane"" didn't show any other R? Actually, we don't know because we only had one R in the guess. So it's possible that the word has only one R, or it has two but we haven't guessed a word with R in another position.

    However, to be safe, we should not assume there is only one R. But for now, we can consider words with or without duplicate R.

    But in the words above, ""MYRRH"" doesn't fit the pattern because the second letter is Y, not R.

  - ""BORNE"": O and E eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""HORNY"": O eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""MOURN"": O and U? M-O-U-R-N -> pattern: M(1), O(2) -> but we need R at second? So no.

  - ""PURIN"": P-U-R-I-N -> but pattern: P(1), U(2)? We need R at second. So no.

  - ""RUING"": R-U-I-N-G -> but then second letter is U? We need R at second. So no.

  - ""WRUNG"": W-R-U-N-G -> W(1), R(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> fits. Letters: W, U, G allowed.

  - ""BRUNG"": not standard? ""Brung"" is not a valid word; the past participle of bring is brought, but sometimes used informally. Avoid.

  - ""DRUNG"": not a word.

  - ""GRUNG"": not a word.

  - ""TRUSS"": T eliminated -> invalid.

So our main candidates are:
  - ""BRING"": tests B, I, G
  - ""DRINK"": tests D, I, K
  - ""PRINK"": tests P, I, K (but less common word)
  - ""WRING"": tests W, I, G
  - ""GRIND"": tests G, I, D
  - ""DRUNK"": tests D, U, K
  - ""WRUNG"": tests W, U, G

We need to choose one that maximizes information. Since we have eliminated many letters, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Note: We haven't tested I, U, Y (vowels) and many consonants.

We should prioritize testing a vowel (I or U) because if we can confirm or eliminate a vowel, it will help a lot.

Also, we have position 3 which is likely a vowel.

So, let's choose a word that has a vowel at position 3.

All the above candidates have either I or U at position 3.

Now, which one to pick? We can also consider the frequency.

I is more common than U in English words.

But we have two vowels left: I and U (Y is also possible, but less common as a vowel in the middle).

We can test I first.

So, among the words with I at position 3: ""BRING"", ""DRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRING"", ""GRIND""

We can avoid ""PRINK"" because it's obscure.

""BRING"" and ""WRING"" both have G at the end. ""DRINK"" has K at the end. ""GRIND"" has D at the end.

We might choose ""DRINK"" because it tests D and K, which are common.

But note: we have position 5 to fill. Common ending letters: we have eliminated T, so other common endings are D, S, Y, etc. But S hasn't been tested? We haven't tested S.

We haven't tested S! That's a very common letter.

Is there a word that fits the pattern and has S?

For example:
  - ""URNS"" is 4 letters.
  - ""BRINS"" not a word.
  - ""GRINS"": G-R-I-N-S -> G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> yes! ""GRINS"" is a word (third person singular of grin).
        Letters: G, I, S. All allowed.

  - ""PRINS"" not a word? Prince without e? No.
  - ""DRINS"" not a word.
  - ""WRENS"": W-R-E-N-S -> but E is eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""BRANS"": A eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""TRONS"": T and O eliminated -> invalid.

So ""GRINS"" is a candidate: G-R-I-N-S.

Similarly, ""GRIND"" is G-R-I-N-D.

Now, S is a very common ending letter, so testing S is valuable.

Therefore, ""GRINS"" is a good candidate because:
  - It tests G at position 1, I at position 3, and S at position 5.
  - S is a new high-frequency letter.

Alternatively, we could test U with a word that has S? But ""WRUNG"" has G, not S.

Is there a word with U and S? 
  - ""URNS"" is 4 letters.
  - ""RUNGS"": R-U-N-G-S -> but pattern: R(1)? We need first letter to be something, then R at second? This would be R at first, not second. So no.
  - ""RUSKS"": R at first -> no.
  - ""BRUSK"": not a word? Or variant of brusque? But spelled with E? Not 5 letters with this pattern.

So no good word with U and S that fits the pattern.

Therefore, we can choose ""GRINS"" to test I and S.

But note: we have ""GRINS"" and ""GRIND"". Both test G and I. The difference is the last letter: S vs D.

Since S is more common, we prefer ""GRINS"".

Another candidate: ""PRISM"": P-R-I-S-M -> but fourth letter is S, not N -> doesn't match.

So, I think ""GRINS"" is a strong candidate.

But let's check if there are other words with S:

  - ""CRISP"": C eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""TRIPS"": T eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""DRIPS"": D-R-I-P-S -> but fourth letter is P? Not N -> no.

So ""GRINS"" seems good.

We could also consider ""BRISK"": but S is at fourth? B-R-I-S-K -> fourth is S, not N -> no.

Therefore, I choose ""GRINS"".

But wait: what about ""BRING""? It doesn't have S, but it's a common word. However, we want to test S.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests U? But without S.

But if we test U and it's not present, we still have to test S later. So testing S now might be better.

We have 4 guesses left? We used 2, so 4 left. We can test U later if needed.

So, let's go with ""GRINS"".

Guess: ""GRINS""

But note: we are not sure if I is in the word. If we guess ""GRINS"", we might get information about I and S.

If I is not in the word, then we know the vowel must be U.

So, we can do:

  Guess 3: ""GRINS""

  If I is present and in the correct position? Then we have _ R I N _ and we know the word is ?RIN? and we have to find the first and last.

  If I is not present, then we know the vowel is U, so we can look for words with U at position 3.

But note: the word might have Y as a vowel? For example, ""CRYPT"" but C and T eliminated. Or ""TRYST"" T eliminated. So less likely.

So, ""GRINS"" is a good guess.

Another candidate: ""BRINK"" -> B-R-I-N-K, but we haven't tested K. But S is more common than K.

I think ""GRINS"" is better.

So, I'll go with ""GRINS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ R _ N _` (R in position 2, N in position 4).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, E, F, O, T (not in the word at all).
- **Untested letters**: Focus on high-frequency consonants (B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, U, W, Y) and vowels (I, U, Y).

### Analysis for Guess 3:
- **Position 3 is likely a vowel** (since A, E, O are eliminated, I or U are prime candidates).
- **Position 5 often ends with common consonants** like S, D, or Y (T is eliminated).
- **Key strategy**: Test new high-frequency letters, especially S (most common unused consonant) and I (common vowel), to maximize information.

**Top candidate words**:
- **GRINS**: Fits the pattern (`G R I N S`), tests G (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), and S (position 5). S is highly frequent and untested.
- Alternatives like ""DRINK"" (tests D, I, K) or ""WRUNG"" (tests W, U, G) were considered, but ""GRINS"" is stronger because:
  - Tests S (more common than K or U).
  - If I is correct, it confirms the vowel; if not, U becomes the primary vowel candidate.
  - Avoids obscure words (e.g., ""PRINK"" is less common).

**Chosen word**: **GRINS**  
- Tests 3 new letters (G, I, S), with high coverage of likely vowels and endings.
- If feedback shows I or S is present, it significantly narrows possibilities (e.g., `_ R I N _` or `_ R _ N S`).

The remaining vowels are I, O, U.\n\n  The word ""IRONY"" covers two vowels (I and O) and Y (which can be vowel-like).\n\n  Another good candidate: ""WRING"" tests W, I, G.\n\n  But perhaps we should prioritize words that have letters that appear frequently in five-letter words.\n\n  Since we have three unknown positions, we might try to get them all in one go.\n\n  But note: if we guess a word that has R and N in the correct places, and if we get other letters correct, we might solve it faster.\n\n  Let\'s think strategy: we have 5 remaining guesses? Actually, we have 5 more after the first (since total 6, we used 1). This is the second guess.\n\n  We can choose a word that covers common vowels and consonants.\n\n  I think ""BRINY"" is a reasonable choice: \n    Common letters: B, R, I, N, Y.\n    We already know R and N are in the word and fixed. We are testing B, I, Y.\n\n  Alternatively, ""TRUNK"" tests T, U, N, K.

P-R-I-N-T -> positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes.\n        Letters: P, R, I, N, T. T is a common consonant. But we haven\'t tested T.\n\n  But note: T is not eliminated? We haven\'t tested T, so it\'s a good candidate.\n\n  Similarly, ""GRINT"" is not a word? Let me check: not sure, but ""GRINT"" might not be valid. But ""GRIND"" we thought earlier.\n\n  Actually, ""PRINT"" is a valid word: \n        We know the pattern is _ R _ N _, and ""PRINT"" is P-R-I-N-T -> fits.\n\n  ""GRIND"" is G-R-I-N-D -> also fits.\n\n  Now, comparing ""PRINT"" and ""BRINY"":\n    Both test I at the third position. \n    ""PRINT"" tests P and T (T at fifth), while ""BRINY"" tests B and Y.\n\n  Since T is more common than Y and P is common, ""PRINT"" might be better.\n\n  But note: we have eliminated vowels A and E, so testing I and other vowels (O, U) is important.\n\n  ""PRINT"" has vowels? I is a vowel. \n\n  So, which word gives the most information?\n\n  We want to test letters that are likely to appear and haven\'t been eliminated.\n\n  Let\'s list the available letters: excluding C, A, E.\n\n  Common available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n  But note: R and N are already in the word, but we know their positions.\n\n  We are focusing on positions 1, 3, 5.\n\n  Position 1: commonly T, S, B, P, ... \n  Position 3: commonly vowels (I, O, U) or consonants.\n  Position 5: commonly T, S, D, Y, etc.\n\n  So a word that includes a vowel (I, O, U) in position 3 would be good.\n\n  Both ""IRONY"" and ""PRINT"" have I at position 3? \n    For ""PRINT"": P(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> I at third.\n  ""IRONY"": I(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> O at third? Actually, third letter is O.\n\n  Correction: ""IRONY"" is I-R-O-N-Y -> so third letter O.\n\n  So ""PRINT"" has I at third and ""IRONY"" has O at third.\n\n  We don\'t know which vowel is present? So choosing a word that uses one of these vowels might help.\n\n  Another candidate: ""CRITH"" is not valid? \n\n  Considering we want to maximize new letters, I propose ""PRINT"" because:\n    P and T are common letters that we haven\'t tested.\n\n  But wait: we know R and N are in the word and correct, so if we guess ""PRINT"", we are testing:\n    P at position 1: if it is correct we get ✓, else if it exists elsewhere we get -, or x.\n    I at position 3: same, could be correct? \n    T at position 5: same.\n\n  It\'s structured so that if the word is ""PRINT"", we win, else we get feedback on P, I, T.\n\n  Similarly, with ""BRINY"" we test B, I, Y.\n\n  Between common letters: T is more common than Y.\n\n  However, we have not tested any of I, O, U vowels yet. Testing one (I or O) is important.\n\n  Perhaps we can choose a word that uses O? For example, ""IRONY"" uses O at position 3.\n\n  Since we have two vowels left (I, O, U), and we don\'t know which, testing one of them might help eliminate.\n\n  But note: we have 5 tries left, we can test one vowel at a time.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that contains multiple vowels? But we have only one vowel slot (position 3) unless the word has vowels at other positions?\n\n  Actually, position 1 and 5 can be vowels too? For example, ""OPERA"" but we don\'t know.\n\n  But in our pattern _ R _ N _, the first or fifth could be vowels.\n\n  Considering we don\'t know what the vowels are (apart from eliminating A and E), we should try to cover vowels.\n\n  However, we are constrained by the pattern.\n\n  Let me list words that fit the pattern: \n    Words we can try: \n      - PRINT (vowel I at third, tests P, T)\n      - BRINY (vowel I at third, tests B, Y)\n      - IRONY (vowel O at third, tests I, Y) -> wait, I at first and O at third.\n      - TRUNK (vowel U at third, tests T, U, K)\n      - GROIN (but does not have N at fourth) -> no.\n      - BROWN (incorrect pattern) -> no.\n\n  After looking, ""TRUNK"" might be a good choice because it tests U (vowel) and T, K. But U at position 3? Yes.\n\n  How about ""FRONT"": F-R-O-N-T -> \n        Positions: F(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), T(5) -> matches, no eliminated letters? \n        Eliminated: we didn\'t test F, O, T. And O is a vowel.\n\n  So ""FRONT"" tests F, O, T.\n\n  It covers the vowel O and two common consonants (F and T).\n\n  So from information perspective, ""FRONT"" uses O which we haven\'t tested (a vowel) and T which is common.\n\n  It provides:\n    F: at first position\n    O: at third\n    T: at fifth\n\n  This seems efficient.\n\n  Alternatively, ""CRWTH"" is not valid? \n\n  So among the candidates: \n    ""IRONY"", ""PRINT"", ""TRUNK"", ""BRINY"", ""FRONT"", ""GRIND""\n\n  Let\'s decide:\n\n  We want to choose a word that uses the pattern, avoids eliminated letters, and introduces new letters that are common.\n\n  I think ""PRINT"" and ""FRONT"" are both strong.\n\n  But note: the word cannot have E or A, so vowels are limited to I, O, U.\n\n  Since we have more consonants to test, but vowels are critical. Testing O might be as good as testing I.\n\n  However, let\'s consider frequency: \n    In five-letter words, E and A are the most common vowels, but we know they aren\'t present. So the next common vowels are O, I, U.\n\n  O is more common than I and U? Not sure, but both should be tested.\n\n  We are going to guess one word, so we pick one.\n\n  I think I\'ll go with ""PRINT"" because:\n    - It includes two very common consonants (P and T) and a vowel (I) in its typical position (vowels often in the middle).\n    - The chance of I being present is significant.\n\n  So my second guess is ""PRINT"".\n\n  However, let me check: what if the word is ""FRONT""? Then by guessing ""PRINT"", we leave F and O untested.\n\n  But we can only test so many letters per guess.\n\n  Another candidate: ""POINT"": has O? P-O-I-N-T -> \n        Positions: P(1), O(2)? but we need second position R -> not possible.\n\n  Only words with R in second and N in fourth.\n\n  After reconsideration: ""FRONT"" might be better because:\n    - It tests the vowel O (in the middle) and T (at the end).\n    - Also tests F (less common but possible).\n\n  And F is a common starting consonant? Not as common as others.\n\n  Actually, T is a very common ending letter.\n\n  Since the fifth position has T in many words, testing T at the end is good.\n\n  So I\'ll switch to ""FRONT"".\n\n  Final decision: ""FRONT"".\n\n  Steps:\n    We know: second letter R, fourth letter N, and not C, A, E.\n    Guess ""FRONT"": \n        F at 1, R at 2, O at 3, N at 4, T at 5.\n\n  If the feedback shows:\n      - F is not in the word? We eliminate F.\n      - O might be present or not? At position 3? If not, we eliminate O if it\'s not present.\n      - T at end? Similarly.\n\n  And R and N should be correct again.\n\n  Using this, we can narrow down.\n\n  So let\'s guess ""FRONT"".\n\n<guess>front</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- **R** is correct and in the second position (✓).\n- **N** is correct and in the fourth position (✓).\n- **C**, **A**, and **E** are not in the word (x).\n\nThe secret word follows the pattern: **\\_ R \\_ N \\_**, with no C, A, or E. \n\nFor the second guess:\n- Prioritize high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., T, O, I, S, L).\n- Focus on vowels (O, I, U) since A and E are eliminated.\n- Ensure the guess fits the pattern **\\_ R \\_ N \\_**.\n\n**Analysis of candidates**:\n- ""PRINT"": Tests P (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), T (common ending). Covers common consonants and a vowel.\n- ""FRONT"": Tests F (position 1), O (vowel, position 3), T (position 5). Efficiently checks O and T.\n- ""TRUNK"": Tests T (position 1), U (vowel, position 3), K (position 5). Good vowel/consonant balance.\n- ""BRINY"": Tests B (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), Y (position 5). Less common letters.\n\n**Chosen word**: ""FRONT""\n- Reasons:\n  - Tests **O** (key vowel candidate).\n  - Uses **T** (common ending letter).\n  - Maximizes new information with high-frequency letters.\n  - Fits the pattern: **F** R **O** N **T**.\n\nThis guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.\n\n<guess>front</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: front -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)\n  A: x (not in the word)\n  N: ✓ (correct position, so fourth letter is N)\n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""front""\n  F: x (not in the word)\n  R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R)\n  O: x (not in the word)\n  N: ✓ (correct position, fourth letter N)\n  T: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The word has the form: _ R _ N _\n- Letters that are not in the word: C, A, E, F, O, T\n- Therefore, eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that:\n  - Second letter is R\n  - Fourth letter is N\n  - Does not contain C, A, E, F, O, T\n\nThe remaining letters to use are from the alphabet excluding these.

We need second letter R. This is M(1), Y(2) -> not R at second. Also, it has two R\'s? But we know the word has R at second, but it might have another R? However, the feedback for ""crane"" had R correct at second, but if there was another R, it would have been marked as present? \n\n    Recall: in ""crane"", we had R at second correct, and no other R was indicated? But the feedback only marks the first occurrence? Actually, Wordle rules: if there are duplicate letters, it can be tricky. But in this case, since we have R at second and it was marked correct, if there is another R, it would be marked as present if it is in the word but in the wrong position? But in ""crane"", we only have one R. Similarly, in ""front"", we had one R and it was correct.\n\n    However, the secret word might have two R\'s? But in the feedback for ""crane"", if there was a second R, and it was in the word but not in the position of the R in ""crane"", it would have been marked with a dash? But in ""crane"", we only have one R, and it was correct, so that R is accounted for. If the word has another R, then when we guessed ""crane"", the feedback would have shown the second R as present? But we didn\'t have a second R in the guess. Similarly, in ""front"", we only have one R and it was correct. So if the word has a second R, it hasn\'t been revealed yet.\n\n    But in our pattern, we have positions: 1, 3, 5 to fill. If we put R in one of those, it would be a second R. But the feedback from ""crane"" didn\'t show any other R? Actually, we don\'t know because we only had one R in the guess. So it\'s possible that the word has only one R, or it has two but we haven\'t guessed a word with R in another position.\n\n    However, to be safe, we should not assume there is only one R. But for now, we can consider words with or without duplicate R.\n\n    But in the words above, ""MYRRH"" doesn\'t fit the pattern because the second letter is Y, not R.\n\n  - ""BORNE"": O and E eliminated -> invalid.\n\n  - ""HORNY"": O eliminated -> invalid.\n\n  - ""MOURN"": O and U?

Avoid.\n\n  - ""DRUNG"": not a word.\n\n  - ""GRUNG"": not a word.\n\n  - ""TRUSS"": T eliminated -> invalid.\n\nSo our main candidates are:\n  - ""BRING"": tests B, I, G\n  - ""DRINK"": tests D, I, K\n  - ""PRINK"": tests P, I, K (but less common word)\n  - ""WRING"": tests W, I, G\n  - ""GRIND"": tests G, I, D\n  - ""DRUNK"": tests D, U, K\n  - ""WRUNG"": tests W, U, G\n\nWe need to choose one that maximizes information. Since we have eliminated many letters, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nNote: We haven\'t tested I, U, Y (vowels) and many consonants.\n\nWe should prioritize testing a vowel (I or U) because if we can confirm or eliminate a vowel, it will help a lot.\n\nAlso, we have position 3 which is likely a vowel.\n\nSo, let\'s choose a word that has a vowel at position 3.\n\nAll the above candidates have either I or U at position 3.\n\nNow, which one to pick? We can also consider the frequency.\n\nI is more common than U in English words.\n\nBut we have two vowels left: I and U (Y is also possible, but less common as a vowel in the middle).\n\nWe can test I first.\n\nSo, among the words with I at position 3: ""BRING"", ""DRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRING"", ""GRIND""\n\nWe can avoid ""PRINK"" because it\'s obscure.\n\n""BRING"" and ""WRING"" both have G at the end. ""DRINK"" has K at the end. ""GRIND"" has D at the end.\n\nWe might choose ""DRINK"" because it tests D and K, which are common.\n\nBut note: we have position 5 to fill. Common ending letters: we have eliminated T, so other common endings are D, S, Y, etc. But S hasn\'t been tested? We haven\'t tested S.\n\nWe haven\'t tested S! That\'s a very common letter.\n\nIs there a word that fits the pattern and has S?\n\nFor example:\n  - ""URNS"" is 4 letters.\n  - ""BRINS"" not a word.\n  - ""GRINS"": G-R-I-N-S -> G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> yes! ""GRINS"" is a word (third person singular of grin).\n        Letters: G, I, S. All allowed.\n\n  - ""PRINS"" not a word? Prince without e? No.\n  - ""DRINS"" not a word.\n  - ""WRENS"": W-R-E-N-S -> but E is eliminated -> invalid.\n  - ""BRANS"": A eliminated -> invalid.\n  - ""TRONS"": T and O eliminated -> invalid.\n\nSo ""GRINS"" is a candidate: G-R-I-N-S.\n\nSimilarly, ""GRIND"" is G-R-I-N-D.\n\nNow, S is a very common ending letter, so testing S is valuable.\n\nTherefore, ""GRINS"" is a good candidate because:\n  - It tests G at position 1, I at position 3, and S at position 5.\n  - S is a new high-frequency letter.\n\nAlternatively, we could test U with a word that has S? But ""WRUNG"" has G, not S.\n\nIs there a word with U and S? \n  - ""URNS"" is 4 letters.\n  - ""RUNGS"": R-U-N-G-S -> but pattern: R(1)? We need first letter to be something, then R at second? This would be R at first, not second. So no.\n  - ""RUSKS"": R at first -> no.\n  - ""BRUSK"": not a word? Or variant of brusque? But spelled with E? Not 5 letters with this pattern.\n\nSo no good word with U and S that fits the pattern.\n\nTherefore, we can choose ""GRINS"" to test I and S.\n\nBut note: we have ""GRINS"" and ""GRIND"". Both test G and I. The difference is the last letter: S vs D.\n\nSince S is more common, we prefer ""GRINS"".\n\nAnother candidate: ""PRISM"": P-R-I-S-M -> but fourth letter is S, not N -> doesn\'t match.\n\nSo, I think ""GRINS"" is a strong candidate.\n\nBut let\'s check if there are other words with S:\n\n  - ""CRISP"": C eliminated -> invalid.\n  - ""TRIPS"": T eliminated -> invalid.\n  - ""DRIPS"": D-R-I-P-S -> but fourth letter is P? Not N -> no.\n\nSo ""GRINS"" seems good.\n\nWe could also consider ""BRISK"": but S is at fourth? B-R-I-S-K -> fourth is S, not N -> no.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""GRINS"".\n\nBut wait: what about ""BRING""? It doesn\'t have S, but it\'s a common word. However, we want to test S.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests U? But without S.\n\nBut if we test U and it\'s not present, we still have to test S later. So testing S now might be better.\n\nWe have 4 guesses left? We used 2, so 4 left. We can test U later if needed.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""GRINS"".\n\nGuess: ""GRINS""\n\nBut note: we are not sure if I is in the word. If we guess ""GRINS"", we might get information about I and S.\n\nIf I is not in the word, then we know the vowel must be U.\n\nSo, we can do:\n\n  Guess 3: ""GRINS""\n\n  If I is present and in the correct position? Then we have _ R I N _ and we know the word is ?RIN? and we have to find the first and last.\n\n  If I is not present, then we know the vowel is U, so we can look for words with U at position 3.\n\nBut note: the word might have Y as a vowel? For example, ""CRYPT"" but C and T eliminated. Or ""TRYST"" T eliminated. So less likely.\n\nSo, ""GRINS"" is a good guess.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BRINK"" -> B-R-I-N-K, but we haven\'t tested K. But S is more common than K.\n\nI think ""GRINS"" is better.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""GRINS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ R _ N _` (R in position 2, N in position 4).\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, E, F, O, T (not in the word at all).\n- **Untested letters**: Focus on high-frequency consonants (B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, U, W, Y) and vowels (I, U, Y).\n\n### Analysis for Guess 3:\n- **Position 3 is likely a vowel** (since A, E, O are eliminated, I or U are prime candidates).\n- **Position 5 often ends with common consonants** like S, D, or Y (T is eliminated).\n- **Key strategy**: Test new high-frequency letters, especially S (most common unused consonant) and I (common vowel), to maximize information.\n\n**Top candidate words**:\n- **GRINS**: Fits the pattern (`G R I N S`), tests G (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), and S (position 5). S is highly frequent and untested.\n- Alternatives like ""DRINK"" (tests D, I, K) or ""WRUNG"" (tests W, U, G) were considered, but ""GRINS"" is stronger because:\n  - Tests S (more common than K or U).\n  - If I is correct, it confirms the vowel; if not, U becomes the primary vowel candidate.\n  - Avoids obscure words (e.g., ""PRINK"" is less common).\n\n**Chosen word**: **GRINS**  \n- Tests 3 new letters (G, I, S), with high coverage of likely vowels and endings.\n- If feedback shows I or S is present, it significantly narrows possibilities (e.g., `_ R I N _` or `_ R _ N S`).\n\n<guess>grins</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: front -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: grins -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
   - So letters: R at position 2 and N at position 4 are correct. C, A, E not in the word.

2. ""front"": F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) T(x)
   - Confirms R at 2 and N at 4. Adds that F, O, T not in the word.

3. ""grins"": G(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) S(x)
   - Now, we have:
        G: not in word (x)
        R: correct at position 2 (✓)
        I: correct at position 3 (✓)  -> so the third letter is I
        N: correct at position 4 (✓)
        S: not in word (x)

So from ""grins"":
   - We now know that the third letter is I: so the word is _ R I N _

Also, eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S.

The secret word is of the form: [letter1] R I N [letter5]

We know letter1 and letter5 must not be any of the eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S.

So available letters for positions 1 and 5: B, D, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and note that I is already used in position 3, but could it be used again? Possibly, though we haven't seen it yet.)

But we need to remember: in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any indication of duplicate letters. However, it's possible.

But let's proceed: the word is ? R I N ?

We have two positions: first and last.

Eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S.

We must choose a word that:
   - Starts and ends with letters not in the eliminated set.
   - Is a valid English word.

Common words with pattern _ R I N _ :

  - ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> but we haven't eliminated B or Y. Let's check: B and Y are still available. So ""BRINY"" is a candidate.
  - ""DRINK"": D-R-I-N-K -> D and K available.
  - ""PRINK"": P-R-I-N-K -> P and K available (but ""PRINK"" is less common).
  - ""WRING"": W-R-I-N-G -> but G is eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""GRIND"": G-R-I-N-D -> G eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""BRINE"": B-R-I-N-E -> E eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""PRINT"": P-R-I-N-T -> T eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""BRING"": B-R-I-N-G -> G eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""TRINE"": T eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""CRIMP"": C eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""URINE"": U-R-I-N-E -> E eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""DRIVE"": D-R-I-V-E -> but pattern would be D R I V E, which has N? No, doesn't have N? Wait, we need fourth letter N, but ""DRIVE"" is D-R-I-V-E -> no N at fourth -> doesn't match.

But wait, our pattern is specifically ? R I N ? so fourth letter is N.

Therefore, the word must end with N? No: fourth letter is N, then fifth letter is something. So the word is not necessarily ending with N? Actually, ""? R I N ?"" means:
   Position 1: unknown
   Position 2: R
   Position 3: I
   Position 4: N
   Position 5: unknown

So the last letter is the fifth, after N.

Candidates:
  - ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> yes.
  - ""DRINK"": D-R-I-N-K -> yes.
  - ""PRINK"": P-R-I-N-K -> yes.
  - ""KRANG"": K-R-A-N-G? No, we need third letter I? So K-R-I-N-G? Not sure if a word? Usually ""KRANG"" is not, but ""KRING"" is no.
  - ""BRINK"": B-R-I-N-K -> yes.
  - ""TRINK"": not a word? 
  - ""WRINK"": W-R-I-N-K? Meaning: a ripple or crease? Valid, rare.
  - ""CHINK"": C eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""THINK"": T eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""BLINK"": L is available? B-L-I-N-K -> but pattern must be: first letter B, second R? We have R at position 2? So ""BLINK"" would be B-L-I-N-K -> second letter L, not R -> doesn't match.

So not ""BLINK"".

Also, note that we have ""DRINK"" and ""BRINK"", etc.

We also haven't tested U, but in this pattern, it might be hard. For example, ""BRUIN"" is B-R-U-I-N -> that would be positions: B(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), N(5)? But we know N is at position 4? So ""BRUIN"" doesn't have I at position 3 and N at position 4? Let's see: B(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), N(5) -> so fourth letter is I? Not N -> doesn't match.

So our candidates: 
  - ""BRINY"" (B, Y)
  - ""DRINK"" (D, K)
  - ""BRINK"" (B, K)
  - ""PRINK"" (P, K)
  - ""WRINK"" (W, K) [rare, but valid]

We want to maximize information? But note: we have only two unknowns: positions 1 and 5. And we have to get one of them.

We can think: the fifth position could be a consonant? Or sometimes a vowel? In this case, Y in ""BRINY"" is acting as a vowel? But also consonants.

We have untested letters: B, D, K, P, W, Y, etc.

If we guess a word that uses no new letters? But we have to. Actually, any guess will test two letters: the first and the last.

But we might solve it directly if we can.

We have 3 guesses left? We used 3, so 3 remain. So we can risk guessing one of these.

Since we have multiple candidates, we might choose one that, if wrong, still gives us information for the remaining.

But note: each guess now tests two letters. So we need to be efficient.

We can also consider: which of these words are more common? The common ones are ""DRINK"" and ""BRINK"". ""BRINY"" is less common but valid.

But ""PRINK"" and ""WRINK"" are rare.

So most likely: ""DRINK"", ""BRINK"", or ""BRINY"".

But we have no information on B, D, K, Y.

So, we might guess ""DRINK"" because:
   - It tests D and K, which are common.
   - If correct, we win.
   - If not, then if D or K are incorrect, we eliminate them and move on.

But if we guess ""DRINK"", and it's wrong, we get feedback on D and K.

Similarly, we could guess a word that tests letters not in the candidate list? But we are constrained to words that match the pattern.

Alternatively, we don't have to guess one of these candidates? We could guess a word that is not necessarily the solution but tests multiple possibilities? But we know the pattern exactly: ? R I N ?. So any other word we guess must still have R at 2, I at 3, N at 4? Because we know they are correct? 

But if we guess a word that doesn't have R at 2, I at 3, N at 4, then the feedback would show which are missing? But we know they are fixed? Actually, we must include R at 2, I at 3, N at 4? Because if we change them, we might get incorrect feedback? But actually, in Wordle, once we know a letter is correct and in position, we should keep it in to test other letters? So for the remaining guesses, we should fix positions 2,3,4 as R,I,N.

So the guess must be of the form [letter1] R I N [letter5].

Therefore, we have to guess a word in that form. So we are forced to test one of the candidates.

So, among the candidates, which one to choose?

We want to cover letters that appear in multiple candidates? But each candidate has distinct letters.

For example, B appears in ""BRINY"" and ""BRINK"". D in ""DRINK"". K in ""DRINK"", ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", etc.

If we guess a word with B and Y, like ""BRINY"", we test B and Y.

If B is present? Then ""BRINK"" might be possible? Or? But actually, the word would have B at first? So if we guess ""BRINY"", and B is correct at first, then we have B R I N Y, but the last letter is Y. If Y is also correct, we win. Else, we know B is at first and Y is wrong? Then we look for? only the last letter.

But we don't have many words left: for last letter possibilities: K, D, etc.

We can list all possible candidates:

With the eliminated letters, the possible words:

  - First letter: must not be eliminated: so B, D, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z... but in practice, common: B, D, K, P, W, Y.

  - Last letter: similarly: must not be eliminated: B, D, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  But common combinations:

    ""DRINK"": D and K
    ""BRINK"": B and K
    ""BRINY"": B and Y
    ""PRINK"": P and K
    ""WRINK"": W and K
    ""BRIND"": B and D? But ""BRIND"" is not a common word? Meaning: spotted, brownish, etc. Valid? Maybe.
    ""KHIMP"": not a word? 
    ""YMINK"": not.

So ""BRIND"" might be a word? But I think ""drink"", ""brink"", ""briny"" are more common.

Also, ""QUINZ"" not a word.

So we'll stick to the main ones.

Now, to decide: 

If we guess ""DRINK"":
   - If correct, we win.
   - If not and D is correct? Then last letter must be something else? But D at first? Then we know the first letter is D, so the word is D R I N ? and only last letter to find? But we have candidates: if D is at first, then the word must be ""DRINK""? because no other D candidate? except ""DRINK"" itself? Or is there ""DRING"" not a word? So we might know it's incorrect? 
   Actually, if ""DRINK"" is guessed and the word has D at first, then we get D(?) and K(?) 
   But if the word is ""DRINK"", we get all correct? 
   Else, if D is correct and K is wrong, then we look for last letter: what words? D R I N ? with ? not K? And not eliminated letters? So ? must be B, D, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But in context: 
        D R I N ?  -> what words? ""DRINA"" is a river? Not common. ""DRINK"" we guessed. ""DRIVE"" but E eliminated and V not tested? Wait.

But in our pattern, we have no words with D at first except ""DRINK""? Because ""DRINK"" is the main word?

Similarly, if we guess ""BRINK"", and it's wrong, but B is correct? Then we know B at first? And then last letter is not K? So we look for words: B R I N ? -> ""BRINY"" or ""BRINE"" but E eliminated? or ""BRING"" G eliminated? or ""BRIND""? So ""BRINY"" or ""BRIND"" if accepted.

So the information from D or B might not be sufficient? 

But if we guess ""BRINY"", we test B and Y. If both correct, we win. If B correct, Y wrong? Then we know first letter B? and last letter must be K? Because ""BRINK"" would be the only common candidate? Similarly, if Y wrong and B wrong? Then we eliminate B and Y.

But note: we don't have many choices left? 

We can also consider the frequency of first letters: B is more common than D? 

But let's see what the feedback might give.

We have two major types: words ending in K (DRINK, BRINK, PRINK, WRINK) and words ending in Y (BRINY).

We can test a word that ends with K to see if that pattern is correct? 

But we must guess one.

I think ""DRINK"" is the most common word: it means to consume liquid. So I'll guess that.

Alternatively, ""BRINK"" means edge, also common.

But ""DRINK"" is more frequent? 

We can also consider that we haven't tested D? It might be better to test D? 

But we have only one chance? Actually, we have three guesses? So we can guess ""DRINK"" now.

If it's correct, done.
If not, then:
   - If D is correct at first? Then the word must be ""DRINK""? So we would get D(✓) and K(x) -> so last letter is not K? But we need to guess a different one? Then we could guess ""BRINY"" next? But D is fixed? So if D is correct and last letter is wrong? We don't know the last? So we have to try another one? 

Let's simulate:

Option: Guess ""DRINK""
   Feedback may be:
      Case 1: D(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(✓) -> win.
      Case 2: D(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(x) -> then we know first letter is D? Actually, D at position 1 is correct? So the word is D R I N ? and the last letter is not K? And not eliminated? So next possible words? 
          D R I N ? -> what words?
          ""DRINY""? Not a word? 
          ""DRINA""? (proper noun, river) not likely?
          So probably no word with D at first? Then we rule out D? But the feedback said D was at correct position? Then it must be D R I N ? and we have no candidate? Contradiction? 

Actually, if we guess ""DRINK"" and get D(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(x), then we know the word is D R I N ? with ? not K? But in the dictionary, are there such words? 
  - ""DRINK"" is the only common word? So this feedback might not occur? 
  Similarly, if we get D(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(✓), then D not at first? So the word has K at last? Then candidates: ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK""

And we know D not in word? Because D at first was not present? So D eliminated? Then we have to choose among ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK"".

Similarly, if both D and K are wrong? Then D and K eliminated? Then candidates: ""BRINY"".

So, if we want to test K at the same time? We can test a word with K? 

But we lose if we guess wrong.

An alternative strategy: guess a word that has letters not in any particular candidate? For example, guess ""BRINY"", which tests B and Y? If wrong, we eliminate B and Y? Then the word must be among ""DRINK"", ""BRINK"", etc? But we lose B and Y? 

If we guess ""BRINY"":
   Case 1: win.
   Case 2: B(✓) and Y(x) -> then first letter B, last letter is not Y? Then must be K? So ""BRINK""?
   Case 3: B(x) and Y(✓) -> then last letter Y? But if B not correct? Then the word is ? R I N Y? candidates: ""URINY""? not a word? ""BRINY"" is the main one? So must be ""BRINY"" with B wrong and Y correct? But first letter would be something else? But we don't have any other candidate? 
   Case 4: B(x) and Y(x) -> then we know the word ends with K? And first letter not B? So candidates: ""DRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK""

Given the possibilities, ""BRINY"" has only one common candidate? Unless we accept ""BRIND"" but not common.

So ""BRINY"" is a risky guess? If it's not correct, we might only narrow down to ending in K? But we don't know the first letter? We have to guess among ""DRINK"", ""BRINK"", etc.

So maybe guessing ""DRINK"" is better? Then if it's not correct, we may find out about K.

We have 3 guesses? We can afford one more.

I think ""DRINK"" is a safe choice: if correct, we win. If not, we eliminate D and K? Or get partial.

But note: if we guess ""DRINK"", and say D is not in the word? Then K could be in the word? But in the feedback, if D is not in the word (x), and K is not in the word (x), then we eliminate D and K? Then the word must be like ""BRINY""? because all K-endings require K? So then ""BRINY"" becomes the only candidate? 

But ""BRINK"", ""DRINK"", etc? If K is eliminated, then ""BRINY"" is the only one? 

Similarly, if D is present but not at first? And K present? But we don't have any candidate with D not at first? 

So after guessing ""DRINK"", the feedback can tell us:

   - If D is correct at first? Then the word must be ""DRINK"" with K correct? But feedback K(x) -> impossible? Then we know the last letter is not K and must be? 

This is confusing.

Perhaps list all possible words again with the pattern _ R I N _ and no eliminated letters.

Possible:

  B R I N Y  -> BRINY
  B R I N K  -> BRINK
  D R I N K  -> DRINK
  P R I N K  -> PRINK
  W R I N K  -> WRINK
  B R I N D  -> BRIND? (if accepted, meaning spotted or streaked, rare)
  M R I N K  -> not a word? ""minK"" is different spelling.

So probably only a few candidates.

To maximize information, we might guess ""DRINK"", which tests D and K? If D is present and in position? Then the word is ""DRINK""? Because other words don't have D? So if D is at first? and the last letter is K? Then all correct? 

If D is present but not at first? But in the pattern, we know D can only be at first? In all candidates, D is only at first in ""DRINK"". 

Similarly, K is only at last in the K-ending words? So if K is in the word? Then it must be at the end? 

But in the feedback, if we guess ""DRINK"", and K is in the word, but not at fifth, then it would be marked with a dash? 

For example, if the word is ""BRINK"", and we guess ""DRINK"", then:

   D: not in word? x
   R: ✓
   I: ✓
   N: ✓
   K: in word but at position 5? In ""DRINK"", K is at 5? In ""BRINK"", K is at 5? So if the word is ""BRINK"", then D is not in word (x), K is at same position? ✓.

So for ""DRINK"" guess:
   - If the word is ""DRINK"": all ✓
   - If the word is ""BRINK"": D(x) and K(✓)
   - If the word is ""BRINY"": D(x) and K(x) -> also Y not in this guess? So Y would be ?

For ""BRINK"": we get D(x) and K(✓) -> so we know the word ends with K? But not D? So candidates are ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK"" -> three possibilities? But we know the first letter must not be D? But among B, P, W? 

Then next guess we can use one that tests one of them? 

For example, if we get D(x) and K(✓), then we know the word is among ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK"". Then we can guess ""BRINK"" next? 

Similarly, if we get D(x) and K(x)? Then the word must be ""BRINY""? Because K is not in the word? So only candidate? Then we can guess ""BRINY"" next? 

So guessing ""DRINK"" and then based on feedback, we can decide.

That seems efficient: we eliminate D and K? Or at least get information about them? 

So I'll go with ""DRINK"".

Guess: ""DRINK"" 

And then we can proceed.

So, let's choose ""DRINK"".

<guess>drink</guess>
Based on accumulated feedback:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R I N _` (R in position 2, I in position 3, N in position 4).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S (not in the word).
- **Remaining possible words**: BRINY, BRINK, DRINK, PRINK, WRINK, etc.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Focus on the most common word among candidates to potentially solve immediately.
- **DRINK** is chosen because:
  - Tests D (position 1) and K (position 5), both common unused letters.
  - If correct, ends the game.
  - If incorrect, feedback on D/K will narrow options significantly:
    - If K is ✓, the word ends with K (e.g., BRINK, PRINK, WRINK).
    - If K is x, BRINY is the primary candidate.
    - D's feedback confirms/eliminates it as a starting letter.

This guess efficiently reduces the solution space with minimal risk.

<guess>drink</guess>
</think>
Based on previous feedback:
- The secret word must match the pattern **\_ R I N \_**.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S (absent from the word).
- **DRINK** is a strong candidate:
  - Fits the pattern (`D R I N K`).
  - Tests high-frequency consonants (D and K) not yet evaluated.
  - Common English word, maximizing solve potential.

If incorrect, feedback will confirm:
- Whether D is in position 1 (✓/x).
- Whether K is in position 5 (✓/x), narrowing to BRINY (if K is absent) or BRINK/PRINK/WRINK (if K is present).

<guess>drink</guess>",drink,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
   - So letters: R at position 2 and N at position 4 are correct. C, A, E not in the word.

2. ""front"": F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) T(x)
   - Confirms R at 2 and N at 4. Adds that F, O, T not in the word.

3. ""grins"": G(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) S(x)
   - Now, we have:
        G: not in word (x)
        R: correct at position 2 (✓)
        I: correct at position 3 (✓)  -> so the third letter is I
        N: correct at position 4 (✓)
        S: not in word (x)

So from ""grins"":
   - We now know that the third letter is I: so the word is _ R I N _

Also, eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S.

The secret word is of the form: [letter1] R I N [letter5]

We know letter1 and letter5 must not be any of the eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S.

So available letters for positions 1 and 5: B, D, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and note that I is already used in position 3, but could it be used again? Possibly, though we haven't seen it yet.)

But we need to remember: in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any indication of duplicate letters. However, it's possible.

But let's proceed: the word is ? R I N ?

We have two positions: first and last.

Eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S.

We must choose a word that:
   - Starts and ends with letters not in the eliminated set.
   - Is a valid English word.

Common words with pattern _ R I N _ :

  - ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> but we haven't eliminated B or Y. Let's check: B and Y are still available. So ""BRINY"" is a candidate.
  - ""DRINK"": D-R-I-N-K -> D and K available.
  - ""PRINK"": P-R-I-N-K -> P and K available (but ""PRINK"" is less common).
  - ""WRING"": W-R-I-N-G -> but G is eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""GRIND"": G-R-I-N-D -> G eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""BRINE"": B-R-I-N-E -> E eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""PRINT"": P-R-I-N-T -> T eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""BRING"": B-R-I-N-G -> G eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""TRINE"": T eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""CRIMP"": C eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""URINE"": U-R-I-N-E -> E eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""DRIVE"": D-R-I-V-E -> but pattern would be D R I V E, which has N? No, doesn't have N? Wait, we need fourth letter N, but ""DRIVE"" is D-R-I-V-E -> no N at fourth -> doesn't match.

But wait, our pattern is specifically ? R I N ? so fourth letter is N.

Therefore, the word must end with N? No: fourth letter is N, then fifth letter is something. So the word is not necessarily ending with N? Actually, ""? R I N ?"" means:
   Position 1: unknown
   Position 2: R
   Position 3: I
   Position 4: N
   Position 5: unknown

So the last letter is the fifth, after N.

Candidates:
  - ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> yes.
  - ""DRINK"": D-R-I-N-K -> yes.
  - ""PRINK"": P-R-I-N-K -> yes.
  - ""KRANG"": K-R-A-N-G? No, we need third letter I? So K-R-I-N-G? Not sure if a word? Usually ""KRANG"" is not, but ""KRING"" is no.
  - ""BRINK"": B-R-I-N-K -> yes.
  - ""TRINK"": not a word? 
  - ""WRINK"": W-R-I-N-K? Meaning: a ripple or crease? Valid, rare.
  - ""CHINK"": C eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""THINK"": T eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""BLINK"": L is available? B-L-I-N-K -> but pattern must be: first letter B, second R? We have R at position 2? So ""BLINK"" would be B-L-I-N-K -> second letter L, not R -> doesn't match.

So not ""BLINK"".

Also, note that we have ""DRINK"" and ""BRINK"", etc.

We also haven't tested U, but in this pattern, it might be hard. For example, ""BRUIN"" is B-R-U-I-N -> that would be positions: B(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), N(5)? But we know N is at position 4? So ""BRUIN"" doesn't have I at position 3 and N at position 4? Let's see: B(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), N(5) -> so fourth letter is I? Not N -> doesn't match.

So our candidates: 
  - ""BRINY"" (B, Y)
  - ""DRINK"" (D, K)
  - ""BRINK"" (B, K)
  - ""PRINK"" (P, K)
  - ""WRINK"" (W, K) [rare, but valid]

We want to maximize information? But note: we have only two unknowns: positions 1 and 5. And we have to get one of them.

We can think: the fifth position could be a consonant? Or sometimes a vowel? In this case, Y in ""BRINY"" is acting as a vowel? But also consonants.

We have untested letters: B, D, K, P, W, Y, etc.

If we guess a word that uses no new letters? But we have to. Actually, any guess will test two letters: the first and the last.

But we might solve it directly if we can.

We have 3 guesses left? We used 3, so 3 remain. So we can risk guessing one of these.

Since we have multiple candidates, we might choose one that, if wrong, still gives us information for the remaining.

But note: each guess now tests two letters. So we need to be efficient.

We can also consider: which of these words are more common? The common ones are ""DRINK"" and ""BRINK"". ""BRINY"" is less common but valid.

But ""PRINK"" and ""WRINK"" are rare.

So most likely: ""DRINK"", ""BRINK"", or ""BRINY"".

But we have no information on B, D, K, Y.

So, we might guess ""DRINK"" because:
   - It tests D and K, which are common.
   - If correct, we win.
   - If not, then if D or K are incorrect, we eliminate them and move on.

But if we guess ""DRINK"", and it's wrong, we get feedback on D and K.

Similarly, we could guess a word that tests letters not in the candidate list? But we are constrained to words that match the pattern.

Alternatively, we don't have to guess one of these candidates? We could guess a word that is not necessarily the solution but tests multiple possibilities? But we know the pattern exactly: ? R I N ?. So any other word we guess must still have R at 2, I at 3, N at 4? Because we know they are correct? 

But if we guess a word that doesn't have R at 2, I at 3, N at 4, then the feedback would show which are missing? But we know they are fixed? Actually, we must include R at 2, I at 3, N at 4? Because if we change them, we might get incorrect feedback? But actually, in Wordle, once we know a letter is correct and in position, we should keep it in to test other letters? So for the remaining guesses, we should fix positions 2,3,4 as R,I,N.

So the guess must be of the form [letter1] R I N [letter5].

Therefore, we have to guess a word in that form. So we are forced to test one of the candidates.

So, among the candidates, which one to choose?

We want to cover letters that appear in multiple candidates? But each candidate has distinct letters.

For example, B appears in ""BRINY"" and ""BRINK"". D in ""DRINK"". K in ""DRINK"", ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", etc.

If we guess a word with B and Y, like ""BRINY"", we test B and Y.

If B is present? Then ""BRINK"" might be possible? Or? But actually, the word would have B at first? So if we guess ""BRINY"", and B is correct at first, then we have B R I N Y, but the last letter is Y. If Y is also correct, we win. Else, we know B is at first and Y is wrong? Then we look for? only the last letter.

But we don't have many words left: for last letter possibilities: K, D, etc.

We can list all possible candidates:

With the eliminated letters, the possible words:

  - First letter: must not be eliminated: so B, D, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z... but in practice, common: B, D, K, P, W, Y.

  - Last letter: similarly: must not be eliminated: B, D, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  But common combinations:

    ""DRINK"": D and K
    ""BRINK"": B and K
    ""BRINY"": B and Y
    ""PRINK"": P and K
    ""WRINK"": W and K
    ""BRIND"": B and D? But ""BRIND"" is not a common word? Meaning: spotted, brownish, etc. Valid? Maybe.
    ""KHIMP"": not a word? 
    ""YMINK"": not.

So ""BRIND"" might be a word? But I think ""drink"", ""brink"", ""briny"" are more common.

Also, ""QUINZ"" not a word.

So we'll stick to the main ones.

Now, to decide: 

If we guess ""DRINK"":
   - If correct, we win.
   - If not and D is correct? Then last letter must be something else? But D at first? Then we know the first letter is D, so the word is D R I N ? and only last letter to find?

        D R I N ?  -> what words? ""DRINA"" is a river? Not common. ""DRINK"" we guessed. ""DRIVE"" but E eliminated and V not tested? Wait.

But in our pattern, we have no words with D at first except ""DRINK""? Because ""DRINK"" is the main word?

We can also consider the frequency of first letters: B is more common than D? 

But let's see what the feedback might give.

We have two major types: words ending in K (DRINK, BRINK, PRINK, WRINK) and words ending in Y (BRINY).

We can test a word that ends with K to see if that pattern is correct? 

But we must guess one.

I think ""DRINK"" is the most common word: it means to consume liquid. So I'll guess that.

Alternatively, ""BRINK"" means edge, also common.

But ""DRINK"" is more frequent? 

We can also consider that we haven't tested D? It might be better to test D? 

But we have only one chance? Actually, we have three guesses? So we can guess ""DRINK"" now.

If it's correct, done.
If not, then:
   - If D is correct at first? Then the word must be ""DRINK""? So we would get D(✓) and K(x) -> so last letter is not K? But we need to guess a different one? Then we could guess ""BRINY"" next? But D is fixed? So if D is correct and last letter is wrong? We don't know the last? So we have to try another one? 

Let's simulate:

Option: Guess ""DRINK""
   Feedback may be:
      Case 1: D(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(✓) -> win.
      Case 2: D(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(x) -> then we know first letter is D? Actually, D at position 1 is correct? So the word is D R I N ? and the last letter is not K? And not eliminated? So next possible words? 
          D R I N ? -> what words?
          ""DRINY""? Not a word? 
          ""DRINA""? (proper noun, river) not likely?
          So probably no word with D at first? Then we rule out D? But the feedback said D was at correct position? Then it must be D R I N ? and we have no candidate? Contradiction? 

Actually, if we guess ""DRINK"" and get D(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(x), then we know the word is D R I N ? with ? not K? But in the dictionary, are there such words? 
  - ""DRINK"" is the only common word? So this feedback might not occur? 
  Similarly, if we get D(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(✓), then D not at first? So the word has K at last? Then candidates: ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK""

And we know D not in word? Because D at first was not present? So D eliminated? Then we have to choose among ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK"".

Similarly, if both D and K are wrong? Then D and K eliminated? Then candidates: ""BRINY"".

So, if we want to test K at the same time? We can test a word with K? 

But we lose if we guess wrong.

An alternative strategy: guess a word that has letters not in any particular candidate? For example, guess ""BRINY"", which tests B and Y? If wrong, we eliminate B and Y? Then the word must be among ""DRINK"", ""BRINK"", etc? But we lose B and Y? 

If we guess ""BRINY"":
   Case 1: win.
   Case 2: B(✓) and Y(x) -> then first letter B, last letter is not Y? Then must be K? So ""BRINK""?
   Case 3: B(x) and Y(✓) -> then last letter Y? But if B not correct? Then the word is ? R I N Y? candidates: ""URINY""? not a word? ""BRINY"" is the main one? So must be ""BRINY"" with B wrong and Y correct? But first letter would be something else? But we don't have any other candidate? 
   Case 4: B(x) and Y(x) -> then we know the word ends with K? And first letter not B? So candidates: ""DRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK""

Given the possibilities, ""BRINY"" has only one common candidate? Unless we accept ""BRIND"" but not common.

So ""BRINY"" is a risky guess? If it's not correct, we might only narrow down to ending in K? But we don't know the first letter? We have to guess among ""DRINK"", ""BRINK"", etc.

So maybe guessing ""DRINK"" is better? Then if it's not correct, we may find out about K.

We have 3 guesses? We can afford one more.

I think ""DRINK"" is a safe choice: if correct, we win. If not, we eliminate D and K? Or get partial.

But note: if we guess ""DRINK"", and say D is not in the word? Then K could be in the word? But in the feedback, if D is not in the word (x), and K is not in the word (x), then we eliminate D and K? Then the word must be like ""BRINY""? because all K-endings require K? So then ""BRINY"" becomes the only candidate? 

But ""BRINK"", ""DRINK"", etc? If K is eliminated, then ""BRINY"" is the only one? 

Similarly, if D is present but not at first? And K present? But we don't have any candidate with D not at first? 

So after guessing ""DRINK"", the feedback can tell us:

   - If D is correct at first? Then the word must be ""DRINK"" with K correct? But feedback K(x) -> impossible? Then we know the last letter is not K and must be? 

This is confusing.

Perhaps list all possible words again with the pattern _ R I N _ and no eliminated letters.

Possible:

  B R I N Y  -> BRINY
  B R I N K  -> BRINK
  D R I N K  -> DRINK
  P R I N K  -> PRINK
  W R I N K  -> WRINK
  B R I N D  -> BRIND? (if accepted, meaning spotted or streaked, rare)
  M R I N K  -> not a word? ""minK"" is different spelling.

So probably only a few candidates.

To maximize information, we might guess ""DRINK"", which tests D and K? If D is present and in position? Then the word is ""DRINK""? Because other words don't have D? So if D is at first? and the last letter is K? Then all correct? 

If D is present but not at first? But in the pattern, we know D can only be at first? In all candidates, D is only at first in ""DRINK"". 

Similarly, K is only at last in the K-ending words? So if K is in the word? Then it must be at the end? 

But in the feedback, if we guess ""DRINK"", and K is in the word, but not at fifth, then it would be marked with a dash? 

For example, if the word is ""BRINK"", and we guess ""DRINK"", then:

   D: not in word? x
   R: ✓
   I: ✓
   N: ✓
   K: in word but at position 5? In ""DRINK"", K is at 5? In ""BRINK"", K is at 5? So if the word is ""BRINK"", then D is not in word (x), K is at same position? ✓.

So for ""DRINK"" guess:
   - If the word is ""DRINK"": all ✓
   - If the word is ""BRINK"": D(x) and K(✓)
   - If the word is ""BRINY"": D(x) and K(x) -> also Y not in this guess? So Y would be ?

For ""BRINK"": we get D(x) and K(✓) -> so we know the word ends with K? But not D? So candidates are ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK"" -> three possibilities? But we know the first letter must not be D? But among B, P, W? 

Then next guess we can use one that tests one of them? 

For example, if we get D(x) and K(✓), then we know the word is among ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK"". Then we can guess ""BRINK"" next? 

Similarly, if we get D(x) and K(x)? Then the word must be ""BRINY""? Because K is not in the word? So only candidate? Then we can guess ""BRINY"" next? 

So guessing ""DRINK"" and then based on feedback, we can decide.

That seems efficient: we eliminate D and K? Or at least get information about them? 

So I'll go with ""DRINK"".

Guess: ""DRINK"" 

And then we can proceed.

So, let's choose ""DRINK"".

<guess>drink</guess>
Based on accumulated feedback:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R I N _` (R in position 2, I in position 3, N in position 4).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S (not in the word).
- **Remaining possible words**: BRINY, BRINK, DRINK, PRINK, WRINK, etc.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Focus on the most common word among candidates to potentially solve immediately.
- **DRINK** is chosen because:
  - Tests D (position 1) and K (position 5), both common unused letters.
  - If correct, ends the game.
  - If incorrect, feedback on D/K will narrow options significantly:
    - If K is ✓, the word ends with K (e.g., BRINK, PRINK, WRINK).
    - If K is x, BRINY is the primary candidate.
    - D's feedback confirms/eliminates it as a starting letter.

This guess efficiently reduces the solution space with minimal risk.

<guess>drink</guess>Based on previous feedback:
- The secret word must match the pattern **\_ R I N \_**.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S (absent from the word).
- **DRINK** is a strong candidate:
  - Fits the pattern (`D R I N K`).
  - Tests high-frequency consonants (D and K) not yet evaluated.
  - Common English word, maximizing solve potential.

If incorrect, feedback will confirm:
- Whether D is in position 1 (✓/x).
- Whether K is in position 5 (✓/x), narrowing to BRINY (if K is absent) or BRINK/PRINK/WRINK (if K is present).",Guess 4: drink -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.
 The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:
   - It contains 'R', 'O', 'A', 'S', 'T' — all common letters.
   - It has two vowels ('O' and 'A') and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let's go with ""ROAST"" for now.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we might avoid repeating those.

 Another popular choice is ""ADIEU"" because it has many vowels, but it has only one common consonant. We want to maximize information.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a very good starting word because:
   - It has three consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - The letters C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common.

 But let me check: the word ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a strong starter.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these is fine. I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I need to make the first guess in this Wordle-like game. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good starter typically includes common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to cover frequent patterns. 

After considering options:
- **Common letters**: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C are among the most frequent in English.
- **Vowel coverage**: Including at least two vowels (like A and E) helps test critical positions.
- **Avoid repeats**: Using distinct letters increases the chance of hitting multiple matches.

Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ROAST"" are strong candidates. I'll choose **""CRANE""** because:
- It contains 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E).
- All letters are distinct, covering 5 unique high-frequency characters.
- It avoids rare letters (like J, Q, Z) and positions vowels flexibly.

This guess should provide useful feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent turns.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the fourth letter)
  E: x (not in the word)

 Therefore, we know:
  - The word has R in the second position and N in the fourth position.
  - The letters C, A, E are not in the word at all.

 The secret word has the form: _ R _ N _

 Since C, A, and E are eliminated, we must choose a word that:
  - Has the second letter R and the fourth letter N.
  - Contains no C, A, or E.

 We also know that the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of letters that can be in the first, third, and fifth positions.

 Remember, we have 5 more guesses (this is the second of 6), so we want to maximize information.

 Since we know two letters (R and N) and their positions, we can try to fill the other positions with common letters that are not eliminated.

 Eliminated letters: C, A, E.

 The word structure: [letter1] R [letter3] N [letter5]

 We should try to use common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as T, L, S, O, I, etc.

 For example, common words matching this pattern: 
  - ""IRONy"" but that's 5 letters? Actually, ""IRONY"" is 5 letters: I-R-O-N-Y -> positions: I in first, R second, O third, N fourth, Y fifth.

 But let's check: are there other possibilities? We need to avoid A, C, E.

 Other examples:
  - ""URBAN"": U-R-B-A-N -> but A is eliminated, so invalid because of A? Wait, the word cannot have A because of the feedback.
    Actually, the feedback said A is not in the word, so ""URBAN"" has A -> invalid.

  - ""CROWN"": has C? C is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""BROWN"": B-R-O-W-N -> 
      First letter: B (not eliminated)
      Third: O
      Fourth: N (known)
      Fifth: N? No, fifth is N? Wait, the word is B-R-O-W-N, so fifth is N? Actually, no: B (1), R (2), O (3), W (4)? No, wait: positions:
        B (1), R (2), O (3), W (4), N (5) -> so fourth is W, not N -> but we need fourth to be N? So this doesn't match.

  We need the fourth letter to be N.

  Correct pattern: _ R _ N _

  So in ""BROWN"", the N is fifth, so not matching.

  Let's think of words ending with N? Actually, the fourth position is N, so the word ends with something? It's _ R _ N _

  So the last letter can be anything.

  Words: 
    ""HORNS"": H-R (then O?): H (1), R (2), O (3), N (4)? Then S (5). Wait, H-R-O-N-S -> but the fourth is O? No: 
        Position 1: H
        Position 2: R
        Position 3: O
        Position 4: N -> wait, that would be ... let me spell: H-O-R-N-S? That's not right. Actually, ""HORNS"" is H-O-R-N-S? 
        But we need R in second and N in fourth. In ""HORNS"":
          H at pos1, O at pos2, R at pos3, N at pos4? Then S at pos5 -> but that would be: H O R N S -> so second letter is O, not R. So no.

  Alternatively, let's list words that have second letter R and fourth letter N.

  Some candidate words:
    ""IRONY"": I-R-O-N-Y -> 
      I at 1, R at 2, O at 3, N at 4, Y at 5 -> matches pattern and no A, C, E -> valid candidate.

    ""URINE"": U-R-I-N-E -> but E is eliminated -> invalid.

    ""TREND"": T-R-E-N-D -> E is eliminated -> invalid.

    ""GRIND"": G-R-I-N-D -> 
        Fourth letter is N? G-R-I-N-D -> positions: G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) -> so yes.
        Letters: G, R, I, N, D. Eliminated letters: C, A, E. So G, I, D are not eliminated? We don't have feedback on them yet.

    ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5) -> no eliminated letters.

    ""PRION"": P-R-I-O-N -> P(1), R(2), I(3), O(4)? Wait, O is fourth? Then N fifth? So structure: P-R-I-O-N -> fourth is O? Not N -> no.

    ""CRONY"": C-R-O-N-Y -> but C is eliminated -> invalid.

    ""GROIN"": G-R-O-I-N -> 
        G(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), N(5) -> fourth letter is I, not N -> no.

  Wait, note: we need fourth letter N, so the word must have N at the fourth position.

  Another one: ""WRING"": W-R-I-N-G -> W(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> valid? Letters: W, I, G are not eliminated.

  ""TRUNK"": T-R-U-N-K -> T(1), R(2), U(3), N(4), K(5) -> U and T, K? Not eliminated.

  ""BRINK"": B-R-I-N-K -> B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> valid.

  But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible to gather more information.

  Best candidates: 
    ""IRONY"", ""GRIND"", ""BRINY"", ""WRING"", ""TRUNK"", ""BRINK""

  We also note that the first guess eliminated A, C, E, so we avoid those.

  Now, we have two correct positions: R at 2 and N at 4. The other positions (1, 3, 5) are unknown.

  We want to maximize information: so we should try to include letters that are common and that we haven't tried.

  In the first guess we tried C, R, A, N, E. So we have feedback on R and N (correct), and eliminated C, A, E.

  For the next guess, we can choose a word that has:
    - Second letter R, fourth letter N.
    - Other positions: use common letters not tested yet, such as T, O, I, S, L, B, D, etc.

  Since we have many candidates, let's pick one that covers multiple possibilities.

  Note: we must avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, E.

  Let's choose ""BRINY"":
    B: not tested
    R: known correct
    I: not tested
    N: known correct
    Y: not tested

  Alternatively, ""TRUNK"" would test T, U, K.

  We might also consider ""IRONY"": I, O, Y are new.

  However, we know that the first guess had A and E eliminated, which are vowels. So we should test other vowels? The remaining vowels are I, O, U.

  The word ""IRONY"" covers two vowels (I and O) and Y (which can be vowel-like).

  Another good candidate: ""WRING"" tests W, I, G.

  But perhaps we should prioritize words that have letters that appear frequently in five-letter words.

  Since we have three unknown positions, we might try to get them all in one go.

  But note: if we guess a word that has R and N in the correct places, and if we get other letters correct, we might solve it faster.

  Let's think strategy: we have 5 remaining guesses? Actually, we have 5 more after the first (since total 6, we used 1). This is the second guess.

  We can choose a word that covers common vowels and consonants.

  I think ""BRINY"" is a reasonable choice: 
    Common letters: B, R, I, N, Y.
    We already know R and N are in the word and fixed. We are testing B, I, Y.

  Alternatively, ""TRUNK"" tests T, U, N, K. But we already know N is in.

  However, I recall that we also need to be cautious: if the unknown positions are consonants or vowels.

  Another popular choice might be ""PRINT"": P-R-I-N-T -> 
        Fourth letter is N? P-R-I-N-T -> positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes.
        Letters: P, R, I, N, T. T is a common consonant. But we haven't tested T.

  But note: T is not eliminated? We haven't tested T, so it's a good candidate.

  Similarly, ""GRINT"" is not a word? Let me check: not sure, but ""GRINT"" might not be valid. But ""GRIND"" we thought earlier.

  Actually, ""PRINT"" is a valid word: 
        We know the pattern is _ R _ N _, and ""PRINT"" is P-R-I-N-T -> fits.

  ""GRIND"" is G-R-I-N-D -> also fits.

  Now, comparing ""PRINT"" and ""BRINY"":
    Both test I at the third position. 
    ""PRINT"" tests P and T (T at fifth), while ""BRINY"" tests B and Y.

  Since T is more common than Y and P is common, ""PRINT"" might be better.

  But note: we have eliminated vowels A and E, so testing I and other vowels (O, U) is important.

  ""PRINT"" has vowels? I is a vowel. 

  So, which word gives the most information?

  We want to test letters that are likely to appear and haven't been eliminated.

  Let's list the available letters: excluding C, A, E.

  Common available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  But note: R and N are already in the word, but we know their positions.

  We are focusing on positions 1, 3, 5.

  Position 1: commonly T, S, B, P, ... 
  Position 3: commonly vowels (I, O, U) or consonants.
  Position 5: commonly T, S, D, Y, etc.

  So a word that includes a vowel (I, O, U) in position 3 would be good.

  Both ""IRONY"" and ""PRINT"" have I at position 3? 
    For ""PRINT"": P(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> I at third.
  ""IRONY"": I(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> O at third? Actually, third letter is O.

  Correction: ""IRONY"" is I-R-O-N-Y -> so third letter O.

  So ""PRINT"" has I at third and ""IRONY"" has O at third.

  We don't know which vowel is present? So choosing a word that uses one of these vowels might help.

  Another candidate: ""CRITH"" is not valid? 

  Considering we want to maximize new letters, I propose ""PRINT"" because:
    P and T are common letters that we haven't tested.

  But wait: we know R and N are in the word and correct, so if we guess ""PRINT"", we are testing:
    P at position 1: if it is correct we get ✓, else if it exists elsewhere we get -, or x.
    I at position 3: same, could be correct? 
    T at position 5: same.

  It's structured so that if the word is ""PRINT"", we win, else we get feedback on P, I, T.

  Similarly, with ""BRINY"" we test B, I, Y.

  Between common letters: T is more common than Y.

  However, we have not tested any of I, O, U vowels yet. Testing one (I or O) is important.

  Perhaps we can choose a word that uses O? For example, ""IRONY"" uses O at position 3.

  Since we have two vowels left (I, O, U), and we don't know which, testing one of them might help eliminate.

  But note: we have 5 tries left, we can test one vowel at a time.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that contains multiple vowels? But we have only one vowel slot (position 3) unless the word has vowels at other positions?

  Actually, position 1 and 5 can be vowels too? For example, ""OPERA"" but we don't know.

  But in our pattern _ R _ N _, the first or fifth could be vowels.

  Considering we don't know what the vowels are (apart from eliminating A and E), we should try to cover vowels.

  However, we are constrained by the pattern.

  Let me list words that fit the pattern: 
    Words we can try: 
      - PRINT (vowel I at third, tests P, T)
      - BRINY (vowel I at third, tests B, Y)
      - IRONY (vowel O at third, tests I, Y) -> wait, I at first and O at third.
      - TRUNK (vowel U at third, tests T, U, K)
      - GROIN (but does not have N at fourth) -> no.
      - BROWN (incorrect pattern) -> no.

  After looking, ""TRUNK"" might be a good choice because it tests U (vowel) and T, K. But U at position 3? Yes.

  How about ""FRONT"": F-R-O-N-T -> 
        Positions: F(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), T(5) -> matches, no eliminated letters? 
        Eliminated: we didn't test F, O, T. And O is a vowel.

  So ""FRONT"" tests F, O, T.

  It covers the vowel O and two common consonants (F and T).

  So from information perspective, ""FRONT"" uses O which we haven't tested (a vowel) and T which is common.

  It provides:
    F: at first position
    O: at third
    T: at fifth

  This seems efficient.

  Alternatively, ""CRWTH"" is not valid? 

  So among the candidates: 
    ""IRONY"", ""PRINT"", ""TRUNK"", ""BRINY"", ""FRONT"", ""GRIND""

  Let's decide:

  We want to choose a word that uses the pattern, avoids eliminated letters, and introduces new letters that are common.

  I think ""PRINT"" and ""FRONT"" are both strong.

  But note: the word cannot have E or A, so vowels are limited to I, O, U.

  Since we have more consonants to test, but vowels are critical. Testing O might be as good as testing I.

  However, let's consider frequency: 
    In five-letter words, E and A are the most common vowels, but we know they aren't present. So the next common vowels are O, I, U.

  O is more common than I and U? Not sure, but both should be tested.

  We are going to guess one word, so we pick one.

  I think I'll go with ""PRINT"" because:
    - It includes two very common consonants (P and T) and a vowel (I) in its typical position (vowels often in the middle).
    - The chance of I being present is significant.

  So my second guess is ""PRINT"".

  However, let me check: what if the word is ""FRONT""? Then by guessing ""PRINT"", we leave F and O untested.

  But we can only test so many letters per guess.

  Another candidate: ""POINT"": has O? P-O-I-N-T -> 
        Positions: P(1), O(2)? but we need second position R -> not possible.

  Only words with R in second and N in fourth.

  After reconsideration: ""FRONT"" might be better because:
    - It tests the vowel O (in the middle) and T (at the end).
    - Also tests F (less common but possible).

  And F is a common starting consonant? Not as common as others.

  Actually, T is a very common ending letter.

  Since the fifth position has T in many words, testing T at the end is good.

  So I'll switch to ""FRONT"".

  Final decision: ""FRONT"".

  Steps:
    We know: second letter R, fourth letter N, and not C, A, E.
    Guess ""FRONT"": 
        F at 1, R at 2, O at 3, N at 4, T at 5.

  If the feedback shows:
      - F is not in the word? We eliminate F.
      - O might be present or not? At position 3? If not, we eliminate O if it's not present.
      - T at end? Similarly.

  And R and N should be correct again.

  Using this, we can narrow down.

  So let's guess ""FRONT"".

<guess>front</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **R** is correct and in the second position (✓).
- **N** is correct and in the fourth position (✓).
- **C**, **A**, and **E** are not in the word (x).

The secret word follows the pattern: **\_ R \_ N \_**, with no C, A, or E. 

For the second guess:
- Prioritize high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., T, O, I, S, L).
- Focus on vowels (O, I, U) since A and E are eliminated.
- Ensure the guess fits the pattern **\_ R \_ N \_**.

**Analysis of candidates**:
- ""PRINT"": Tests P (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), T (common ending). Covers common consonants and a vowel.
- ""FRONT"": Tests F (position 1), O (vowel, position 3), T (position 5). Efficiently checks O and T.
- ""TRUNK"": Tests T (position 1), U (vowel, position 3), K (position 5). Good vowel/consonant balance.
- ""BRINY"": Tests B (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), Y (position 5). Less common letters.

**Chosen word**: ""FRONT""
- Reasons:
  - Tests **O** (key vowel candidate).
  - Uses **T** (common ending letter).
  - Maximizes new information with high-frequency letters.
  - Fits the pattern: **F** R **O** N **T**.

This guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: front -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: ✓ (correct position, so fourth letter is N)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""front""
  F: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R)
  O: x (not in the word)
  N: ✓ (correct position, fourth letter N)
  T: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The word has the form: _ R _ N _
- Letters that are not in the word: C, A, E, F, O, T
- Therefore, eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
  - Second letter is R
  - Fourth letter is N
  - Does not contain C, A, E, F, O, T

The remaining letters to use are from the alphabet excluding these. We should focus on common letters that haven't been tested.

Available letters (consonants and vowels): 
  B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: we have not tested any vowels except A, E, O (which are eliminated) and we haven't tested I, U, Y (which can be vowels). Since A, E, O are out, the word must contain one of I, U, or Y (or sometimes W, but less common) as a vowel.

The pattern: [1] R [3] N [5]

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters from the available set, and the word must be valid.

Let's think of common words that fit:

- Position 3: This is often a vowel. Since A, E, O are out, likely I, U, or Y (if Y is used as a vowel). But Y can also be a consonant.

Possible words:

  - ""BRING"": B-R-I-N-G -> 
        B at 1, R at 2, I at 3, N at 4, G at 5.
        Check letters: B, I, G are not eliminated? 
        Eliminated: C,A,E,F,O,T. So B, I, G are allowed.

  - ""DRINK"": D-R-I-N-K -> D, I, K are allowed.

  - ""PRINK"": P-R-I-N-K -> P, I, K allowed? But ""PRINK"" is a word? (meaning: to dress or adorn in a showy manner) - valid.

  - ""WRING"": W-R-I-N-G -> W, I, G allowed.

  - ""GRIND"": G-R-I-N-D -> G, I, D allowed.

  - ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> B, I, Y allowed. But we tried Y? Not yet.

  - ""CRIMP"": but C is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""TRIPY"": T is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""URBAN"": but A is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""URINE"": E is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""DRUNK"": D-R-U-N-K -> U is allowed? Yes, and D, K allowed.

  - ""GRUNT"": T is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""BRUNT"": T eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""PRUNE"": E eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""CRONE"": C and E eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""IRONY"": I-R-O-N-Y -> but O is eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""CRWTH"": not a common word and C eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""MYRRH"": M-Y-R-R-H -> but the pattern: second letter is Y? We need second letter R. This is M(1), Y(2) -> not R at second. Also, it has two R's? But we know the word has R at second, but it might have another R? However, the feedback for ""crane"" had R correct at second, but if there was another R, it would have been marked as present? 

    Recall: in ""crane"", we had R at second correct, and no other R was indicated? But the feedback only marks the first occurrence? Actually, Wordle rules: if there are duplicate letters, it can be tricky. But in this case, since we have R at second and it was marked correct, if there is another R, it would be marked as present if it is in the word but in the wrong position? But in ""crane"", we only have one R. Similarly, in ""front"", we had one R and it was correct.

    However, the secret word might have two R's? But in the feedback for ""crane"", if there was a second R, and it was in the word but not in the position of the R in ""crane"", it would have been marked with a dash? But in ""crane"", we only have one R, and it was correct, so that R is accounted for. If the word has another R, then when we guessed ""crane"", the feedback would have shown the second R as present? But we didn't have a second R in the guess. Similarly, in ""front"", we only have one R and it was correct. So if the word has a second R, it hasn't been revealed yet.

    But in our pattern, we have positions: 1, 3, 5 to fill. If we put R in one of those, it would be a second R. But the feedback from ""crane"" didn't show any other R? Actually, we don't know because we only had one R in the guess. So it's possible that the word has only one R, or it has two but we haven't guessed a word with R in another position.

    However, to be safe, we should not assume there is only one R. But for now, we can consider words with or without duplicate R.

    But in the words above, ""MYRRH"" doesn't fit the pattern because the second letter is Y, not R.

  - ""BORNE"": O and E eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""HORNY"": O eliminated -> invalid.

  - ""MOURN"": O and U? M-O-U-R-N -> pattern: M(1), O(2) -> but we need R at second? So no.

  - ""PURIN"": P-U-R-I-N -> but pattern: P(1), U(2)? We need R at second. So no.

  - ""RUING"": R-U-I-N-G -> but then second letter is U? We need R at second. So no.

  - ""WRUNG"": W-R-U-N-G -> W(1), R(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> fits. Letters: W, U, G allowed.

  - ""BRUNG"": not standard? ""Brung"" is not a valid word; the past participle of bring is brought, but sometimes used informally. Avoid.

  - ""DRUNG"": not a word.

  - ""GRUNG"": not a word.

  - ""TRUSS"": T eliminated -> invalid.

So our main candidates are:
  - ""BRING"": tests B, I, G
  - ""DRINK"": tests D, I, K
  - ""PRINK"": tests P, I, K (but less common word)
  - ""WRING"": tests W, I, G
  - ""GRIND"": tests G, I, D
  - ""DRUNK"": tests D, U, K
  - ""WRUNG"": tests W, U, G

We need to choose one that maximizes information. Since we have eliminated many letters, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Note: We haven't tested I, U, Y (vowels) and many consonants.

We should prioritize testing a vowel (I or U) because if we can confirm or eliminate a vowel, it will help a lot.

Also, we have position 3 which is likely a vowel.

So, let's choose a word that has a vowel at position 3.

All the above candidates have either I or U at position 3.

Now, which one to pick? We can also consider the frequency.

I is more common than U in English words.

But we have two vowels left: I and U (Y is also possible, but less common as a vowel in the middle).

We can test I first.

So, among the words with I at position 3: ""BRING"", ""DRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRING"", ""GRIND""

We can avoid ""PRINK"" because it's obscure.

""BRING"" and ""WRING"" both have G at the end. ""DRINK"" has K at the end. ""GRIND"" has D at the end.

We might choose ""DRINK"" because it tests D and K, which are common.

But note: we have position 5 to fill. Common ending letters: we have eliminated T, so other common endings are D, S, Y, etc. But S hasn't been tested? We haven't tested S.

We haven't tested S! That's a very common letter.

Is there a word that fits the pattern and has S?

For example:
  - ""URNS"" is 4 letters.
  - ""BRINS"" not a word.
  - ""GRINS"": G-R-I-N-S -> G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> yes! ""GRINS"" is a word (third person singular of grin).
        Letters: G, I, S. All allowed.

  - ""PRINS"" not a word? Prince without e? No.
  - ""DRINS"" not a word.
  - ""WRENS"": W-R-E-N-S -> but E is eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""BRANS"": A eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""TRONS"": T and O eliminated -> invalid.

So ""GRINS"" is a candidate: G-R-I-N-S.

Similarly, ""GRIND"" is G-R-I-N-D.

Now, S is a very common ending letter, so testing S is valuable.

Therefore, ""GRINS"" is a good candidate because:
  - It tests G at position 1, I at position 3, and S at position 5.
  - S is a new high-frequency letter.

Alternatively, we could test U with a word that has S? But ""WRUNG"" has G, not S.

Is there a word with U and S? 
  - ""URNS"" is 4 letters.
  - ""RUNGS"": R-U-N-G-S -> but pattern: R(1)? We need first letter to be something, then R at second? This would be R at first, not second. So no.
  - ""RUSKS"": R at first -> no.
  - ""BRUSK"": not a word? Or variant of brusque? But spelled with E? Not 5 letters with this pattern.

So no good word with U and S that fits the pattern.

Therefore, we can choose ""GRINS"" to test I and S.

But note: we have ""GRINS"" and ""GRIND"". Both test G and I. The difference is the last letter: S vs D.

Since S is more common, we prefer ""GRINS"".

Another candidate: ""PRISM"": P-R-I-S-M -> but fourth letter is S, not N -> doesn't match.

So, I think ""GRINS"" is a strong candidate.

But let's check if there are other words with S:

  - ""CRISP"": C eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""TRIPS"": T eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""DRIPS"": D-R-I-P-S -> but fourth letter is P? Not N -> no.

So ""GRINS"" seems good.

We could also consider ""BRISK"": but S is at fourth? B-R-I-S-K -> fourth is S, not N -> no.

Therefore, I choose ""GRINS"".

But wait: what about ""BRING""? It doesn't have S, but it's a common word. However, we want to test S.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests U? But without S.

But if we test U and it's not present, we still have to test S later. So testing S now might be better.

We have 4 guesses left? We used 2, so 4 left. We can test U later if needed.

So, let's go with ""GRINS"".

Guess: ""GRINS""

But note: we are not sure if I is in the word. If we guess ""GRINS"", we might get information about I and S.

If I is not in the word, then we know the vowel must be U.

So, we can do:

  Guess 3: ""GRINS""

  If I is present and in the correct position? Then we have _ R I N _ and we know the word is ?RIN? and we have to find the first and last.

  If I is not present, then we know the vowel is U, so we can look for words with U at position 3.

But note: the word might have Y as a vowel? For example, ""CRYPT"" but C and T eliminated. Or ""TRYST"" T eliminated. So less likely.

So, ""GRINS"" is a good guess.

Another candidate: ""BRINK"" -> B-R-I-N-K, but we haven't tested K. But S is more common than K.

I think ""GRINS"" is better.

So, I'll go with ""GRINS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ R _ N _` (R in position 2, N in position 4).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, E, F, O, T (not in the word at all).
- **Untested letters**: Focus on high-frequency consonants (B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, U, W, Y) and vowels (I, U, Y).

### Analysis for Guess 3:
- **Position 3 is likely a vowel** (since A, E, O are eliminated, I or U are prime candidates).
- **Position 5 often ends with common consonants** like S, D, or Y (T is eliminated).
- **Key strategy**: Test new high-frequency letters, especially S (most common unused consonant) and I (common vowel), to maximize information.

**Top candidate words**:
- **GRINS**: Fits the pattern (`G R I N S`), tests G (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), and S (position 5). S is highly frequent and untested.
- Alternatives like ""DRINK"" (tests D, I, K) or ""WRUNG"" (tests W, U, G) were considered, but ""GRINS"" is stronger because:
  - Tests S (more common than K or U).
  - If I is correct, it confirms the vowel; if not, U becomes the primary vowel candidate.
  - Avoids obscure words (e.g., ""PRINK"" is less common).

**Chosen word**: **GRINS**  
- Tests 3 new letters (G, I, S), with high coverage of likely vowels and endings.
- If feedback shows I or S is present, it significantly narrows possibilities (e.g., `_ R I N _` or `_ R _ N S`).

<guess>grins</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: front -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: grins -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
   - So letters: R at position 2 and N at position 4 are correct. C, A, E not in the word.

2. ""front"": F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) T(x)
   - Confirms R at 2 and N at 4. Adds that F, O, T not in the word.

3. ""grins"": G(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) S(x)
   - Now, we have:
        G: not in word (x)
        R: correct at position 2 (✓)
        I: correct at position 3 (✓)  -> so the third letter is I
        N: correct at position 4 (✓)
        S: not in word (x)

So from ""grins"":
   - We now know that the third letter is I: so the word is _ R I N _

Also, eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S.

The secret word is of the form: [letter1] R I N [letter5]

We know letter1 and letter5 must not be any of the eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S.

So available letters for positions 1 and 5: B, D, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and note that I is already used in position 3, but could it be used again? Possibly, though we haven't seen it yet.)

But we need to remember: in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any indication of duplicate letters. However, it's possible.

But let's proceed: the word is ? R I N ?

We have two positions: first and last.

Eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S.

We must choose a word that:
   - Starts and ends with letters not in the eliminated set.
   - Is a valid English word.

Common words with pattern _ R I N _ :

  - ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> but we haven't eliminated B or Y. Let's check: B and Y are still available. So ""BRINY"" is a candidate.
  - ""DRINK"": D-R-I-N-K -> D and K available.
  - ""PRINK"": P-R-I-N-K -> P and K available (but ""PRINK"" is less common).
  - ""WRING"": W-R-I-N-G -> but G is eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""GRIND"": G-R-I-N-D -> G eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""BRINE"": B-R-I-N-E -> E eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""PRINT"": P-R-I-N-T -> T eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""BRING"": B-R-I-N-G -> G eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""TRINE"": T eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""CRIMP"": C eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""URINE"": U-R-I-N-E -> E eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""DRIVE"": D-R-I-V-E -> but pattern would be D R I V E, which has N? No, doesn't have N? Wait, we need fourth letter N, but ""DRIVE"" is D-R-I-V-E -> no N at fourth -> doesn't match.

But wait, our pattern is specifically ? R I N ? so fourth letter is N.

Therefore, the word must end with N? No: fourth letter is N, then fifth letter is something. So the word is not necessarily ending with N? Actually, ""? R I N ?"" means:
   Position 1: unknown
   Position 2: R
   Position 3: I
   Position 4: N
   Position 5: unknown

So the last letter is the fifth, after N.

Candidates:
  - ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> yes.
  - ""DRINK"": D-R-I-N-K -> yes.
  - ""PRINK"": P-R-I-N-K -> yes.
  - ""KRANG"": K-R-A-N-G? No, we need third letter I? So K-R-I-N-G? Not sure if a word? Usually ""KRANG"" is not, but ""KRING"" is no.
  - ""BRINK"": B-R-I-N-K -> yes.
  - ""TRINK"": not a word? 
  - ""WRINK"": W-R-I-N-K? Meaning: a ripple or crease? Valid, rare.
  - ""CHINK"": C eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""THINK"": T eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""BLINK"": L is available? B-L-I-N-K -> but pattern must be: first letter B, second R? We have R at position 2? So ""BLINK"" would be B-L-I-N-K -> second letter L, not R -> doesn't match.

So not ""BLINK"".

Also, note that we have ""DRINK"" and ""BRINK"", etc.

We also haven't tested U, but in this pattern, it might be hard. For example, ""BRUIN"" is B-R-U-I-N -> that would be positions: B(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), N(5)? But we know N is at position 4? So ""BRUIN"" doesn't have I at position 3 and N at position 4? Let's see: B(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), N(5) -> so fourth letter is I? Not N -> doesn't match.

So our candidates: 
  - ""BRINY"" (B, Y)
  - ""DRINK"" (D, K)
  - ""BRINK"" (B, K)
  - ""PRINK"" (P, K)
  - ""WRINK"" (W, K) [rare, but valid]

We want to maximize information? But note: we have only two unknowns: positions 1 and 5. And we have to get one of them.

We can think: the fifth position could be a consonant? Or sometimes a vowel? In this case, Y in ""BRINY"" is acting as a vowel? But also consonants.

We have untested letters: B, D, K, P, W, Y, etc.

If we guess a word that uses no new letters? But we have to. Actually, any guess will test two letters: the first and the last.

But we might solve it directly if we can.

We have 3 guesses left? We used 3, so 3 remain. So we can risk guessing one of these.

Since we have multiple candidates, we might choose one that, if wrong, still gives us information for the remaining.

But note: each guess now tests two letters. So we need to be efficient.

We can also consider: which of these words are more common? The common ones are ""DRINK"" and ""BRINK"". ""BRINY"" is less common but valid.

But ""PRINK"" and ""WRINK"" are rare.

So most likely: ""DRINK"", ""BRINK"", or ""BRINY"".

But we have no information on B, D, K, Y.

So, we might guess ""DRINK"" because:
   - It tests D and K, which are common.
   - If correct, we win.
   - If not, then if D or K are incorrect, we eliminate them and move on.

But if we guess ""DRINK"", and it's wrong, we get feedback on D and K.

Similarly, we could guess a word that tests letters not in the candidate list? But we are constrained to words that match the pattern.

Alternatively, we don't have to guess one of these candidates? We could guess a word that is not necessarily the solution but tests multiple possibilities? But we know the pattern exactly: ? R I N ?. So any other word we guess must still have R at 2, I at 3, N at 4? Because we know they are correct? 

But if we guess a word that doesn't have R at 2, I at 3, N at 4, then the feedback would show which are missing? But we know they are fixed? Actually, we must include R at 2, I at 3, N at 4? Because if we change them, we might get incorrect feedback? But actually, in Wordle, once we know a letter is correct and in position, we should keep it in to test other letters? So for the remaining guesses, we should fix positions 2,3,4 as R,I,N.

So the guess must be of the form [letter1] R I N [letter5].

Therefore, we have to guess a word in that form. So we are forced to test one of the candidates.

So, among the candidates, which one to choose?

We want to cover letters that appear in multiple candidates? But each candidate has distinct letters.

For example, B appears in ""BRINY"" and ""BRINK"". D in ""DRINK"". K in ""DRINK"", ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", etc.

If we guess a word with B and Y, like ""BRINY"", we test B and Y.

If B is present? Then ""BRINK"" might be possible? Or? But actually, the word would have B at first? So if we guess ""BRINY"", and B is correct at first, then we have B R I N Y, but the last letter is Y. If Y is also correct, we win. Else, we know B is at first and Y is wrong? Then we look for? only the last letter.

But we don't have many words left: for last letter possibilities: K, D, etc.

We can list all possible candidates:

With the eliminated letters, the possible words:

  - First letter: must not be eliminated: so B, D, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z... but in practice, common: B, D, K, P, W, Y.

  - Last letter: similarly: must not be eliminated: B, D, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  But common combinations:

    ""DRINK"": D and K
    ""BRINK"": B and K
    ""BRINY"": B and Y
    ""PRINK"": P and K
    ""WRINK"": W and K
    ""BRIND"": B and D? But ""BRIND"" is not a common word? Meaning: spotted, brownish, etc. Valid? Maybe.
    ""KHIMP"": not a word? 
    ""YMINK"": not.

So ""BRIND"" might be a word? But I think ""drink"", ""brink"", ""briny"" are more common.

Also, ""QUINZ"" not a word.

So we'll stick to the main ones.

Now, to decide: 

If we guess ""DRINK"":
   - If correct, we win.
   - If not and D is correct? Then last letter must be something else? But D at first? Then we know the first letter is D, so the word is D R I N ? and only last letter to find? But we have candidates: if D is at first, then the word must be ""DRINK""? because no other D candidate? except ""DRINK"" itself? Or is there ""DRING"" not a word? So we might know it's incorrect? 
   Actually, if ""DRINK"" is guessed and the word has D at first, then we get D(?) and K(?) 
   But if the word is ""DRINK"", we get all correct? 
   Else, if D is correct and K is wrong, then we look for last letter: what words? D R I N ? with ? not K? And not eliminated letters? So ? must be B, D, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But in context: 
        D R I N ?  -> what words? ""DRINA"" is a river? Not common. ""DRINK"" we guessed. ""DRIVE"" but E eliminated and V not tested? Wait.

But in our pattern, we have no words with D at first except ""DRINK""? Because ""DRINK"" is the main word?

Similarly, if we guess ""BRINK"", and it's wrong, but B is correct? Then we know B at first? And then last letter is not K? So we look for words: B R I N ? -> ""BRINY"" or ""BRINE"" but E eliminated? or ""BRING"" G eliminated? or ""BRIND""? So ""BRINY"" or ""BRIND"" if accepted.

So the information from D or B might not be sufficient? 

But if we guess ""BRINY"", we test B and Y. If both correct, we win. If B correct, Y wrong? Then we know first letter B? and last letter must be K? Because ""BRINK"" would be the only common candidate? Similarly, if Y wrong and B wrong? Then we eliminate B and Y.

But note: we don't have many choices left? 

We can also consider the frequency of first letters: B is more common than D? 

But let's see what the feedback might give.

We have two major types: words ending in K (DRINK, BRINK, PRINK, WRINK) and words ending in Y (BRINY).

We can test a word that ends with K to see if that pattern is correct? 

But we must guess one.

I think ""DRINK"" is the most common word: it means to consume liquid. So I'll guess that.

Alternatively, ""BRINK"" means edge, also common.

But ""DRINK"" is more frequent? 

We can also consider that we haven't tested D? It might be better to test D? 

But we have only one chance? Actually, we have three guesses? So we can guess ""DRINK"" now.

If it's correct, done.
If not, then:
   - If D is correct at first? Then the word must be ""DRINK""? So we would get D(✓) and K(x) -> so last letter is not K? But we need to guess a different one? Then we could guess ""BRINY"" next? But D is fixed? So if D is correct and last letter is wrong? We don't know the last? So we have to try another one? 

Let's simulate:

Option: Guess ""DRINK""
   Feedback may be:
      Case 1: D(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(✓) -> win.
      Case 2: D(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(x) -> then we know first letter is D? Actually, D at position 1 is correct? So the word is D R I N ? and the last letter is not K? And not eliminated? So next possible words? 
          D R I N ? -> what words?
          ""DRINY""? Not a word? 
          ""DRINA""? (proper noun, river) not likely?
          So probably no word with D at first? Then we rule out D? But the feedback said D was at correct position? Then it must be D R I N ? and we have no candidate? Contradiction? 

Actually, if we guess ""DRINK"" and get D(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(x), then we know the word is D R I N ? with ? not K? But in the dictionary, are there such words? 
  - ""DRINK"" is the only common word? So this feedback might not occur? 
  Similarly, if we get D(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(✓), then D not at first? So the word has K at last? Then candidates: ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK""

And we know D not in word? Because D at first was not present? So D eliminated? Then we have to choose among ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK"".

Similarly, if both D and K are wrong? Then D and K eliminated? Then candidates: ""BRINY"".

So, if we want to test K at the same time? We can test a word with K? 

But we lose if we guess wrong.

An alternative strategy: guess a word that has letters not in any particular candidate? For example, guess ""BRINY"", which tests B and Y? If wrong, we eliminate B and Y? Then the word must be among ""DRINK"", ""BRINK"", etc? But we lose B and Y? 

If we guess ""BRINY"":
   Case 1: win.
   Case 2: B(✓) and Y(x) -> then first letter B, last letter is not Y? Then must be K? So ""BRINK""?
   Case 3: B(x) and Y(✓) -> then last letter Y? But if B not correct? Then the word is ? R I N Y? candidates: ""URINY""? not a word? ""BRINY"" is the main one? So must be ""BRINY"" with B wrong and Y correct? But first letter would be something else? But we don't have any other candidate? 
   Case 4: B(x) and Y(x) -> then we know the word ends with K? And first letter not B? So candidates: ""DRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK""

Given the possibilities, ""BRINY"" has only one common candidate? Unless we accept ""BRIND"" but not common.

So ""BRINY"" is a risky guess? If it's not correct, we might only narrow down to ending in K? But we don't know the first letter? We have to guess among ""DRINK"", ""BRINK"", etc.

So maybe guessing ""DRINK"" is better? Then if it's not correct, we may find out about K.

We have 3 guesses? We can afford one more.

I think ""DRINK"" is a safe choice: if correct, we win. If not, we eliminate D and K? Or get partial.

But note: if we guess ""DRINK"", and say D is not in the word? Then K could be in the word? But in the feedback, if D is not in the word (x), and K is not in the word (x), then we eliminate D and K? Then the word must be like ""BRINY""? because all K-endings require K? So then ""BRINY"" becomes the only candidate? 

But ""BRINK"", ""DRINK"", etc? If K is eliminated, then ""BRINY"" is the only one? 

Similarly, if D is present but not at first? And K present? But we don't have any candidate with D not at first? 

So after guessing ""DRINK"", the feedback can tell us:

   - If D is correct at first? Then the word must be ""DRINK"" with K correct? But feedback K(x) -> impossible? Then we know the last letter is not K and must be? 

This is confusing.

Perhaps list all possible words again with the pattern _ R I N _ and no eliminated letters.

Possible:

  B R I N Y  -> BRINY
  B R I N K  -> BRINK
  D R I N K  -> DRINK
  P R I N K  -> PRINK
  W R I N K  -> WRINK
  B R I N D  -> BRIND? (if accepted, meaning spotted or streaked, rare)
  M R I N K  -> not a word? ""minK"" is different spelling.

So probably only a few candidates.

To maximize information, we might guess ""DRINK"", which tests D and K? If D is present and in position? Then the word is ""DRINK""? Because other words don't have D? So if D is at first? and the last letter is K? Then all correct? 

If D is present but not at first? But in the pattern, we know D can only be at first? In all candidates, D is only at first in ""DRINK"". 

Similarly, K is only at last in the K-ending words? So if K is in the word? Then it must be at the end? 

But in the feedback, if we guess ""DRINK"", and K is in the word, but not at fifth, then it would be marked with a dash? 

For example, if the word is ""BRINK"", and we guess ""DRINK"", then:

   D: not in word? x
   R: ✓
   I: ✓
   N: ✓
   K: in word but at position 5? In ""DRINK"", K is at 5? In ""BRINK"", K is at 5? So if the word is ""BRINK"", then D is not in word (x), K is at same position? ✓.

So for ""DRINK"" guess:
   - If the word is ""DRINK"": all ✓
   - If the word is ""BRINK"": D(x) and K(✓)
   - If the word is ""BRINY"": D(x) and K(x) -> also Y not in this guess? So Y would be ?

For ""BRINK"": we get D(x) and K(✓) -> so we know the word ends with K? But not D? So candidates are ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK"" -> three possibilities? But we know the first letter must not be D? But among B, P, W? 

Then next guess we can use one that tests one of them? 

For example, if we get D(x) and K(✓), then we know the word is among ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK"". Then we can guess ""BRINK"" next? 

Similarly, if we get D(x) and K(x)? Then the word must be ""BRINY""? Because K is not in the word? So only candidate? Then we can guess ""BRINY"" next? 

So guessing ""DRINK"" and then based on feedback, we can decide.

That seems efficient: we eliminate D and K? Or at least get information about them? 

So I'll go with ""DRINK"".

Guess: ""DRINK"" 

And then we can proceed.

So, let's choose ""DRINK"".

<guess>drink</guess>
Based on accumulated feedback:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R I N _` (R in position 2, I in position 3, N in position 4).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S (not in the word).
- **Remaining possible words**: BRINY, BRINK, DRINK, PRINK, WRINK, etc.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Focus on the most common word among candidates to potentially solve immediately.
- **DRINK** is chosen because:
  - Tests D (position 1) and K (position 5), both common unused letters.
  - If correct, ends the game.
  - If incorrect, feedback on D/K will narrow options significantly:
    - If K is ✓, the word ends with K (e.g., BRINK, PRINK, WRINK).
    - If K is x, BRINY is the primary candidate.
    - D's feedback confirms/eliminates it as a starting letter.

This guess efficiently reduces the solution space with minimal risk.

<guess>drink</guess>Based on previous feedback:
- The secret word must match the pattern **\_ R I N \_**.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S (absent from the word).
- **DRINK** is a strong candidate:
  - Fits the pattern (`D R I N K`).
  - Tests high-frequency consonants (D and K) not yet evaluated.
  - Common English word, maximizing solve potential.

If incorrect, feedback will confirm:
- Whether D is in position 1 (✓/x).
- Whether K is in position 5 (✓/x), narrowing to BRINY (if K is absent) or BRINK/PRINK/WRINK (if K is present).

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.\n The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:\n   - It contains \'R\', \'O\', \'A\', \'S\', \'T\' — all common letters.\n   - It has two vowels (\'O\' and \'A\') and three consonants.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"".

Actually, the fourth position is N, so the word ends with something? It\'s _ R _ N _\n\n  So the last letter can be anything.\n\n  Words: \n    ""HORNS"": H-R (then O?): H (1), R (2), O (3), N (4)?

Then S at pos5 -> but that would be: H O R N S -> so second letter is O, not R. So no.\n\n  Alternatively, let\'s list words that have second letter R and fourth letter N.\n\n  Some candidate words:\n    ""IRONY"": I-R-O-N-Y -> \n      I at 1, R at 2, O at 3, N at 4, Y at 5 -> matches pattern and no A, C, E -> valid candidate.\n\n    ""URINE"": U-R-I-N-E -> but E is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n    ""TREND"": T-R-E-N-D -> E is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n    ""GRIND"": G-R-I-N-D -> \n        Fourth letter is N? G-R-I-N-D -> positions: G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) -> so yes.\n        Letters: G, R, I, N, D. Eliminated letters: C, A, E. So G, I, D are not eliminated? We don\'t have feedback on them yet.\n\n    ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5) -> no eliminated letters.\n\n    ""PRION"": P-R-I-O-N -> P(1), R(2), I(3), O(4)? Wait, O is fourth?

Letters: W, I, G are not eliminated.\n\n  ""TRUNK"": T-R-U-N-K -> T(1), R(2), U(3), N(4), K(5) -> U and T, K? Not eliminated.\n\n  ""BRINK"": B-R-I-N-K -> B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> valid.\n\n  But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible to gather more information.\n\n  Best candidates: \n    ""IRONY"", ""GRIND"", ""BRINY"", ""WRING"", ""TRUNK"", ""BRINK""\n\n  We also note that the first guess eliminated A, C, E, so we avoid those.\n\n  Now, we have two correct positions: R at 2 and N at 4. The other positions (1, 3, 5) are unknown.\n\n  We want to maximize information: so we should try to include letters that are common and that we haven\'t tried.\n\n  In the first guess we tried C, R, A, N, E. So we have feedback on R and N (correct), and eliminated C, A, E.\n\n  For the next guess, we can choose a word that has:\n    - Second letter R, fourth letter N.\n    - Other positions: use common letters not tested yet, such as T, O, I, S, L, B, D, etc.\n\n  Since we have many candidates, let\'s pick one that covers multiple possibilities.\n\n  Note: we must avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, E.\n\n  Let\'s choose ""BRINY"":\n    B: not tested\n    R: known correct\n    I: not tested\n    N: known correct\n    Y: not tested\n\n  Alternatively, ""TRUNK"" would test T, U, K.\n\n  We might also consider ""IRONY"": I, O, Y are new.\n\n  However, we know that the first guess had A and E eliminated, which are vowels. So we should test other vowels? The remaining vowels are I, O, U.\n\n  The word ""IRONY"" covers two vowels (I and O) and Y (which can be vowel-like).\n\n  Another good candidate: ""WRING"" tests W, I, G.\n\n  But perhaps we should prioritize words that have letters that appear frequently in five-letter words.\n\n  Since we have three unknown positions, we might try to get them all in one go.\n\n  But note: if we guess a word that has R and N in the correct places, and if we get other letters correct, we might solve it faster.\n\n  Let\'s think strategy: we have 5 remaining guesses? Actually, we have 5 more after the first (since total 6, we used 1). This is the second guess.\n\n  We can choose a word that covers common vowels and consonants.\n\n  I think ""BRINY"" is a reasonable choice: \n    Common letters: B, R, I, N, Y.\n    We already know R and N are in the word and fixed. We are testing B, I, Y.\n\n  Alternatively, ""TRUNK"" tests T, U, N, K. But we already know N is in.\n\n  However, I recall that we also need to be cautious: if the unknown positions are consonants or vowels.\n\n  Another popular choice might be ""PRINT"": P-R-I-N-T -> \n        Fourth letter is N? P-R-I-N-T -> positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes.\n        Letters: P, R, I, N, T. T is a common consonant. But we haven\'t tested T.\n\n  But note: T is not eliminated? We haven\'t tested T, so it\'s a good candidate.\n\n  Similarly, ""GRINT"" is not a word? Let me check: not sure, but ""GRINT"" might not be valid. But ""GRIND"" we thought earlier.\n\n  Actually, ""PRINT"" is a valid word: \n        We know the pattern is _ R _ N _, and ""PRINT"" is P-R-I-N-T -> fits.\n\n  ""GRIND"" is G-R-I-N-D -> also fits.\n\n  Now, comparing ""PRINT"" and ""BRINY"":\n    Both test I at the third position. \n    ""PRINT"" tests P and T (T at fifth), while ""BRINY"" tests B and Y.\n\n  Since T is more common than Y and P is common, ""PRINT"" might be better.\n\n  But note: we have eliminated vowels A and E, so testing I and other vowels (O, U) is important.\n\n  ""PRINT"" has vowels? I is a vowel. \n\n  So, which word gives the most information?\n\n  We want to test letters that are likely to appear and haven\'t been eliminated.\n\n  Let\'s list the available letters: excluding C, A, E.\n\n  Common available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n  But note: R and N are already in the word, but we know their positions.\n\n  We are focusing on positions 1, 3, 5.\n\n  Position 1: commonly T, S, B, P, ... \n  Position 3: commonly vowels (I, O, U) or consonants.\n  Position 5: commonly T, S, D, Y, etc.\n\n  So a word that includes a vowel (I, O, U) in position 3 would be good.\n\n  Both ""IRONY"" and ""PRINT"" have I at position 3? \n    For ""PRINT"": P(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> I at third.\n  ""IRONY"": I(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> O at third? Actually, third letter is O.\n\n  Correction: ""IRONY"" is I-R-O-N-Y -> so third letter O.\n\n  So ""PRINT"" has I at third and ""IRONY"" has O at third.\n\n  We don\'t know which vowel is present? So choosing a word that uses one of these vowels might help.\n\n  Another candidate: ""CRITH"" is not valid? \n\n  Considering we want to maximize new letters, I propose ""PRINT"" because:\n    P and T are common letters that we haven\'t tested.\n\n  But wait: we know R and N are in the word and correct, so if we guess ""PRINT"", we are testing:\n    P at position 1: if it is correct we get ✓, else if it exists elsewhere we get -, or x.\n    I at position 3: same, could be correct? \n    T at position 5: same.\n\n  It\'s structured so that if the word is ""PRINT"", we win, else we get feedback on P, I, T.\n\n  Similarly, with ""BRINY"" we test B, I, Y.\n\n  Between common letters: T is more common than Y.\n\n  However, we have not tested any of I, O, U vowels yet. Testing one (I or O) is important.\n\n  Perhaps we can choose a word that uses O? For example, ""IRONY"" uses O at position 3.\n\n  Since we have two vowels left (I, O, U), and we don\'t know which, testing one of them might help eliminate.\n\n  But note: we have 5 tries left, we can test one vowel at a time.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that contains multiple vowels? But we have only one vowel slot (position 3) unless the word has vowels at other positions?\n\n  Actually, position 1 and 5 can be vowels too? For example, ""OPERA"" but we don\'t know.\n\n  But in our pattern _ R _ N _, the first or fifth could be vowels.\n\n  Considering we don\'t know what the vowels are (apart from eliminating A and E), we should try to cover vowels.\n\n  However, we are constrained by the pattern.\n\n  Let me list words that fit the pattern: \n    Words we can try: \n      - PRINT (vowel I at third, tests P, T)\n      - BRINY (vowel I at third, tests B, Y)\n      - IRONY (vowel O at third, tests I, Y) -> wait, I at first and O at third.\n      - TRUNK (vowel U at third, tests T, U, K)\n      - GROIN (but does not have N at fourth) -> no.\n      - BROWN (incorrect pattern) -> no.\n\n  After looking, ""TRUNK"" might be a good choice because it tests U (vowel) and T, K. But U at position 3? Yes.\n\n  How about ""FRONT"": F-R-O-N-T -> \n        Positions: F(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), T(5) -> matches, no eliminated letters? \n        Eliminated: we didn\'t test F, O, T. And O is a vowel.\n\n  So ""FRONT"" tests F, O, T.\n\n  It covers the vowel O and two common consonants (F and T).\n\n  So from information perspective, ""FRONT"" uses O which we haven\'t tested (a vowel) and T which is common.\n\n  It provides:\n    F: at first position\n    O: at third\n    T: at fifth\n\n  This seems efficient.\n\n  Alternatively, ""CRWTH"" is not valid? \n\n  So among the candidates: \n    ""IRONY"", ""PRINT"", ""TRUNK"", ""BRINY"", ""FRONT"", ""GRIND""\n\n  Let\'s decide:\n\n  We want to choose a word that uses the pattern, avoids eliminated letters, and introduces new letters that are common.\n\n  I think ""PRINT"" and ""FRONT"" are both strong.\n\n  But note: the word cannot have E or A, so vowels are limited to I, O, U.\n\n  Since we have more consonants to test, but vowels are critical. Testing O might be as good as testing I.\n\n  However, let\'s consider frequency: \n    In five-letter words, E and A are the most common vowels, but we know they aren\'t present. So the next common vowels are O, I, U.\n\n  O is more common than I and U? Not sure, but both should be tested.\n\n  We are going to guess one word, so we pick one.\n\n  I think I\'ll go with ""PRINT"" because:\n    - It includes two very common consonants (P and T) and a vowel (I) in its typical position (vowels often in the middle).\n    - The chance of I being present is significant.\n\n  So my second guess is ""PRINT"".\n\n  However, let me check: what if the word is ""FRONT""? Then by guessing ""PRINT"", we leave F and O untested.\n\n  But we can only test so many letters per guess.\n\n  Another candidate: ""POINT"": has O? P-O-I-N-T -> \n        Positions: P(1), O(2)? but we need second position R -> not possible.\n\n  Only words with R in second and N in fourth.\n\n  After reconsideration: ""FRONT"" might be better because:\n    - It tests the vowel O (in the middle) and T (at the end).\n    - Also tests F (less common but possible).\n\n  And F is a common starting consonant? Not as common as others.\n\n  Actually, T is a very common ending letter.\n\n  Since the fifth position has T in many words, testing T at the end is good.\n\n  So I\'ll switch to ""FRONT"".\n\n  Final decision: ""FRONT"".\n\n  Steps:\n    We know: second letter R, fourth letter N, and not C, A, E.\n    Guess ""FRONT"": \n        F at 1, R at 2, O at 3, N at 4, T at 5.\n\n  If the feedback shows:\n      - F is not in the word? We eliminate F.\n      - O might be present or not? At position 3? If not, we eliminate O if it\'s not present.\n      - T at end? Similarly.\n\n  And R and N should be correct again.\n\n  Using this, we can narrow down.\n\n  So let\'s guess ""FRONT"".\n\n<guess>front</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- **R** is correct and in the second position (✓).\n- **N** is correct and in the fourth position (✓).\n- **C**, **A**, and **E** are not in the word (x).\n\nThe secret word follows the pattern: **\\_ R \\_ N \\_**, with no C, A, or E. \n\nFor the second guess:\n- Prioritize high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., T, O, I, S, L).\n- Focus on vowels (O, I, U) since A and E are eliminated.\n- Ensure the guess fits the pattern **\\_ R \\_ N \\_**.\n\n**Analysis of candidates**:\n- ""PRINT"": Tests P (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), T (common ending). Covers common consonants and a vowel.\n- ""FRONT"": Tests F (position 1), O (vowel, position 3), T (position 5). Efficiently checks O and T.\n- ""TRUNK"": Tests T (position 1), U (vowel, position 3), K (position 5). Good vowel/consonant balance.\n- ""BRINY"": Tests B (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), Y (position 5). Less common letters.\n\n**Chosen word**: ""FRONT""\n- Reasons:\n  - Tests **O** (key vowel candidate).\n  - Uses **T** (common ending letter).\n  - Maximizes new information with high-frequency letters.\n  - Fits the pattern: **F** R **O** N **T**.\n\nThis guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.\n\n<guess>front</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: front -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)\n  A: x (not in the word)\n  N: ✓ (correct position, so fourth letter is N)\n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""front""\n  F: x (not in the word)\n  R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R)\n  O: x (not in the word)\n  N: ✓ (correct position, fourth letter N)\n  T: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The word has the form: _ R _ N _\n- Letters that are not in the word: C, A, E, F, O, T\n- Therefore, eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that:\n  - Second letter is R\n  - Fourth letter is N\n  - Does not contain C, A, E, F, O, T\n\nThe remaining letters to use are from the alphabet excluding these.

Since A, E, O are out, likely I, U, or Y (if Y is used as a vowel). But Y can also be a consonant.\n\nPossible words:\n\n  - ""BRING"": B-R-I-N-G -> \n        B at 1, R at 2, I at 3, N at 4, G at 5.\n        Check letters: B, I, G are not eliminated? \n        Eliminated: C,A,E,F,O,T. So B, I, G are allowed.\n\n  - ""DRINK"": D-R-I-N-K -> D, I, K are allowed.\n\n  - ""PRINK"": P-R-I-N-K -> P, I, K allowed? But ""PRINK"" is a word? (meaning: to dress or adorn in a showy manner) - valid.\n\n  - ""WRING"": W-R-I-N-G -> W, I, G allowed.\n\n  - ""GRIND"": G-R-I-N-D -> G, I, D allowed.\n\n  - ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> B, I, Y allowed.

Yes, and D, K allowed.\n\n  - ""GRUNT"": T is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n  - ""BRUNT"": T eliminated -> invalid.\n\n  - ""PRUNE"": E eliminated -> invalid.\n\n  - ""CRONE"": C and E eliminated -> invalid.\n\n  - ""IRONY"": I-R-O-N-Y -> but O is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n  - ""CRWTH"": not a common word and C eliminated -> invalid.\n\n  - ""MYRRH"": M-Y-R-R-H -> but the pattern: second letter is Y? We need second letter R. This is M(1), Y(2) -> not R at second. Also, it has two R\'s? But we know the word has R at second, but it might have another R? However, the feedback for ""crane"" had R correct at second, but if there was another R, it would have been marked as present? \n\n    Recall: in ""crane"", we had R at second correct, and no other R was indicated? But the feedback only marks the first occurrence? Actually, Wordle rules: if there are duplicate letters, it can be tricky. But in this case, since we have R at second and it was marked correct, if there is another R, it would be marked as present if it is in the word but in the wrong position? But in ""crane"", we only have one R. Similarly, in ""front"", we had one R and it was correct.\n\n    However, the secret word might have two R\'s? But in the feedback for ""crane"", if there was a second R, and it was in the word but not in the position of the R in ""crane"", it would have been marked with a dash? But in ""crane"", we only have one R, and it was correct, so that R is accounted for. If the word has another R, then when we guessed ""crane"", the feedback would have shown the second R as present? But we didn\'t have a second R in the guess. Similarly, in ""front"", we only have one R and it was correct. So if the word has a second R, it hasn\'t been revealed yet.\n\n    But in our pattern, we have positions: 1, 3, 5 to fill. If we put R in one of those, it would be a second R. But the feedback from ""crane"" didn\'t show any other R? Actually, we don\'t know because we only had one R in the guess. So it\'s possible that the word has only one R, or it has two but we haven\'t guessed a word with R in another position.\n\n    However, to be safe, we should not assume there is only one R. But for now, we can consider words with or without duplicate R.\n\n    But in the words above, ""MYRRH"" doesn\'t fit the pattern because the second letter is Y, not R.\n\n  - ""BORNE"": O and E eliminated -> invalid.\n\n  - ""HORNY"": O eliminated -> invalid.\n\n  - ""MOURN"": O and U? M-O-U-R-N -> pattern: M(1), O(2) -> but we need R at second? So no.\n\n  - ""PURIN"": P-U-R-I-N -> but pattern: P(1), U(2)? We need R at second. So no.\n\n  - ""RUING"": R-U-I-N-G -> but then second letter is U? We need R at second. So no.\n\n  - ""WRUNG"": W-R-U-N-G -> W(1), R(2), U(3), N(4), G(5) -> fits. Letters: W, U, G allowed.\n\n  - ""BRUNG"": not standard? ""Brung"" is not a valid word; the past participle of bring is brought, but sometimes used informally. Avoid.\n\n  - ""DRUNG"": not a word.\n\n  - ""GRUNG"": not a word.\n\n  - ""TRUSS"": T eliminated -> invalid.\n\nSo our main candidates are:\n  - ""BRING"": tests B, I, G\n  - ""DRINK"": tests D, I, K\n  - ""PRINK"": tests P, I, K (but less common word)\n  - ""WRING"": tests W, I, G\n  - ""GRIND"": tests G, I, D\n  - ""DRUNK"": tests D, U, K\n  - ""WRUNG"": tests W, U, G\n\nWe need to choose one that maximizes information. Since we have eliminated many letters, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nNote: We haven\'t tested I, U, Y (vowels) and many consonants.\n\nWe should prioritize testing a vowel (I or U) because if we can confirm or eliminate a vowel, it will help a lot.\n\nAlso, we have position 3 which is likely a vowel.\n\nSo, let\'s choose a word that has a vowel at position 3.\n\nAll the above candidates have either I or U at position 3.\n\nNow, which one to pick? We can also consider the frequency.\n\nI is more common than U in English words.\n\nBut we have two vowels left: I and U (Y is also possible, but less common as a vowel in the middle).\n\nWe can test I first.\n\nSo, among the words with I at position 3: ""BRING"", ""DRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRING"", ""GRIND""\n\nWe can avoid ""PRINK"" because it\'s obscure.\n\n""BRING"" and ""WRING"" both have G at the end. ""DRINK"" has K at the end. ""GRIND"" has D at the end.\n\nWe might choose ""DRINK"" because it tests D and K, which are common.\n\nBut note: we have position 5 to fill. Common ending letters: we have eliminated T, so other common endings are D, S, Y, etc. But S hasn\'t been tested? We haven\'t tested S.\n\nWe haven\'t tested S! That\'s a very common letter.\n\nIs there a word that fits the pattern and has S?\n\nFor example:\n  - ""URNS"" is 4 letters.\n  - ""BRINS"" not a word.\n  - ""GRINS"": G-R-I-N-S -> G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> yes! ""GRINS"" is a word (third person singular of grin).\n        Letters: G, I, S. All allowed.\n\n  - ""PRINS"" not a word? Prince without e? No.\n  - ""DRINS"" not a word.\n  - ""WRENS"": W-R-E-N-S -> but E is eliminated -> invalid.\n  - ""BRANS"": A eliminated -> invalid.\n  - ""TRONS"": T and O eliminated -> invalid.\n\nSo ""GRINS"" is a candidate: G-R-I-N-S.\n\nSimilarly, ""GRIND"" is G-R-I-N-D.\n\nNow, S is a very common ending letter, so testing S is valuable.\n\nTherefore, ""GRINS"" is a good candidate because:\n  - It tests G at position 1, I at position 3, and S at position 5.\n  - S is a new high-frequency letter.\n\nAlternatively, we could test U with a word that has S? But ""WRUNG"" has G, not S.\n\nIs there a word with U and S? \n  - ""URNS"" is 4 letters.\n  - ""RUNGS"": R-U-N-G-S -> but pattern: R(1)? We need first letter to be something, then R at second? This would be R at first, not second. So no.\n  - ""RUSKS"": R at first -> no.\n  - ""BRUSK"": not a word? Or variant of brusque? But spelled with E? Not 5 letters with this pattern.\n\nSo no good word with U and S that fits the pattern.\n\nTherefore, we can choose ""GRINS"" to test I and S.\n\nBut note: we have ""GRINS"" and ""GRIND"". Both test G and I. The difference is the last letter: S vs D.\n\nSince S is more common, we prefer ""GRINS"".\n\nAnother candidate: ""PRISM"": P-R-I-S-M -> but fourth letter is S, not N -> doesn\'t match.\n\nSo, I think ""GRINS"" is a strong candidate.\n\nBut let\'s check if there are other words with S:\n\n  - ""CRISP"": C eliminated -> invalid.\n  - ""TRIPS"": T eliminated -> invalid.\n  - ""DRIPS"": D-R-I-P-S -> but fourth letter is P? Not N -> no.\n\nSo ""GRINS"" seems good.\n\nWe could also consider ""BRISK"": but S is at fourth? B-R-I-S-K -> fourth is S, not N -> no.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""GRINS"".\n\nBut wait: what about ""BRING""? It doesn\'t have S, but it\'s a common word. However, we want to test S.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests U? But without S.\n\nBut if we test U and it\'s not present, we still have to test S later. So testing S now might be better.\n\nWe have 4 guesses left? We used 2, so 4 left. We can test U later if needed.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""GRINS"".\n\nGuess: ""GRINS""\n\nBut note: we are not sure if I is in the word. If we guess ""GRINS"", we might get information about I and S.\n\nIf I is not in the word, then we know the vowel must be U.\n\nSo, we can do:\n\n  Guess 3: ""GRINS""\n\n  If I is present and in the correct position? Then we have _ R I N _ and we know the word is ?RIN? and we have to find the first and last.\n\n  If I is not present, then we know the vowel is U, so we can look for words with U at position 3.\n\nBut note: the word might have Y as a vowel? For example, ""CRYPT"" but C and T eliminated. Or ""TRYST"" T eliminated. So less likely.\n\nSo, ""GRINS"" is a good guess.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BRINK"" -> B-R-I-N-K, but we haven\'t tested K. But S is more common than K.\n\nI think ""GRINS"" is better.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""GRINS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ R _ N _` (R in position 2, N in position 4).\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, E, F, O, T (not in the word at all).\n- **Untested letters**: Focus on high-frequency consonants (B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, U, W, Y) and vowels (I, U, Y).\n\n### Analysis for Guess 3:\n- **Position 3 is likely a vowel** (since A, E, O are eliminated, I or U are prime candidates).\n- **Position 5 often ends with common consonants** like S, D, or Y (T is eliminated).\n- **Key strategy**: Test new high-frequency letters, especially S (most common unused consonant) and I (common vowel), to maximize information.\n\n**Top candidate words**:\n- **GRINS**: Fits the pattern (`G R I N S`), tests G (position 1), I (vowel, position 3), and S (position 5). S is highly frequent and untested.\n- Alternatives like ""DRINK"" (tests D, I, K) or ""WRUNG"" (tests W, U, G) were considered, but ""GRINS"" is stronger because:\n  - Tests S (more common than K or U).\n  - If I is correct, it confirms the vowel; if not, U becomes the primary vowel candidate.\n  - Avoids obscure words (e.g., ""PRINK"" is less common).\n\n**Chosen word**: **GRINS**  \n- Tests 3 new letters (G, I, S), with high coverage of likely vowels and endings.\n- If feedback shows I or S is present, it significantly narrows possibilities (e.g., `_ R I N _` or `_ R _ N S`).\n\n<guess>grins</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: front -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: grins -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\n1.

No, doesn\'t have N? Wait, we need fourth letter N, but ""DRIVE"" is D-R-I-V-E -> no N at fourth -> doesn\'t match.\n\nBut wait, our pattern is specifically ? R I N ? so fourth letter is N.\n\nTherefore, the word must end with N? No: fourth letter is N, then fifth letter is something. So the word is not necessarily ending with N? Actually, ""? R I N ?"" means:\n   Position 1: unknown\n   Position 2: R\n   Position 3: I\n   Position 4: N\n   Position 5: unknown\n\nSo the last letter is the fifth, after N.\n\nCandidates:\n  - ""BRINY"": B-R-I-N-Y -> yes.\n  - ""DRINK"": D-R-I-N-K -> yes.\n  - ""PRINK"": P-R-I-N-K -> yes.\n  - ""KRANG"": K-R-A-N-G? No, we need third letter I? So K-R-I-N-G? Not sure if a word? Usually ""KRANG"" is not, but ""KRING"" is no.\n  - ""BRINK"": B-R-I-N-K -> yes.\n  - ""TRINK"": not a word? \n  - ""WRINK"": W-R-I-N-K? Meaning: a ripple or crease? Valid, rare.\n  - ""CHINK"": C eliminated -> invalid.\n  - ""THINK"": T eliminated -> invalid.\n  - ""BLINK"": L is available? B-L-I-N-K -> but pattern must be: first letter B, second R? We have R at position 2? So ""BLINK"" would be B-L-I-N-K -> second letter L, not R -> doesn\'t match.\n\nSo not ""BLINK"".\n\nAlso, note that we have ""DRINK"" and ""BRINK"", etc.\n\nWe also haven\'t tested U, but in this pattern, it might be hard. For example, ""BRUIN"" is B-R-U-I-N -> that would be positions: B(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), N(5)? But we know N is at position 4? So ""BRUIN"" doesn\'t have I at position 3 and N at position 4? Let\'s see: B(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), N(5) -> so fourth letter is I? Not N -> doesn\'t match.\n\nSo our candidates: \n  - ""BRINY"" (B, Y)\n  - ""DRINK"" (D, K)\n  - ""BRINK"" (B, K)\n  - ""PRINK"" (P, K)\n  - ""WRINK"" (W, K) [rare, but valid]\n\nWe want to maximize information? But note: we have only two unknowns: positions 1 and 5. And we have to get one of them.\n\nWe can think: the fifth position could be a consonant? Or sometimes a vowel? In this case, Y in ""BRINY"" is acting as a vowel? But also consonants.\n\nWe have untested letters: B, D, K, P, W, Y, etc.\n\nIf we guess a word that uses no new letters? But we have to. Actually, any guess will test two letters: the first and the last.\n\nBut we might solve it directly if we can.\n\nWe have 3 guesses left? We used 3, so 3 remain. So we can risk guessing one of these.\n\nSince we have multiple candidates, we might choose one that, if wrong, still gives us information for the remaining.\n\nBut note: each guess now tests two letters. So we need to be efficient.\n\nWe can also consider: which of these words are more common? The common ones are ""DRINK"" and ""BRINK"". ""BRINY"" is less common but valid.\n\nBut ""PRINK"" and ""WRINK"" are rare.\n\nSo most likely: ""DRINK"", ""BRINK"", or ""BRINY"".\n\nBut we have no information on B, D, K, Y.\n\nSo, we might guess ""DRINK"" because:\n   - It tests D and K, which are common.\n   - If correct, we win.\n   - If not, then if D or K are incorrect, we eliminate them and move on.\n\nBut if we guess ""DRINK"", and it\'s wrong, we get feedback on D and K.\n\nSimilarly, we could guess a word that tests letters not in the candidate list? But we are constrained to words that match the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we don\'t have to guess one of these candidates? We could guess a word that is not necessarily the solution but tests multiple possibilities? But we know the pattern exactly: ? R I N ?. So any other word we guess must still have R at 2, I at 3, N at 4? Because we know they are correct? \n\nBut if we guess a word that doesn\'t have R at 2, I at 3, N at 4, then the feedback would show which are missing? But we know they are fixed? Actually, we must include R at 2, I at 3, N at 4? Because if we change them, we might get incorrect feedback? But actually, in Wordle, once we know a letter is correct and in position, we should keep it in to test other letters? So for the remaining guesses, we should fix positions 2,3,4 as R,I,N.\n\nSo the guess must be of the form [letter1] R I N [letter5].\n\nTherefore, we have to guess a word in that form. So we are forced to test one of the candidates.\n\nSo, among the candidates, which one to choose?\n\nWe want to cover letters that appear in multiple candidates? But each candidate has distinct letters.\n\nFor example, B appears in ""BRINY"" and ""BRINK"". D in ""DRINK"". K in ""DRINK"", ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", etc.\n\nIf we guess a word with B and Y, like ""BRINY"", we test B and Y.\n\nIf B is present? Then ""BRINK"" might be possible? Or? But actually, the word would have B at first? So if we guess ""BRINY"", and B is correct at first, then we have B R I N Y, but the last letter is Y. If Y is also correct, we win. Else, we know B is at first and Y is wrong? Then we look for? only the last letter.\n\nBut we don\'t have many words left: for last letter possibilities: K, D, etc.\n\nWe can list all possible candidates:\n\nWith the eliminated letters, the possible words:\n\n  - First letter: must not be eliminated: so B, D, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z... but in practice, common: B, D, K, P, W, Y.\n\n  - Last letter: similarly: must not be eliminated: B, D, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n  But common combinations:\n\n    ""DRINK"": D and K\n    ""BRINK"": B and K\n    ""BRINY"": B and Y\n    ""PRINK"": P and K\n    ""WRINK"": W and K\n    ""BRIND"": B and D? But ""BRIND"" is not a common word? Meaning: spotted, brownish, etc. Valid? Maybe.\n    ""KHIMP"": not a word? \n    ""YMINK"": not.\n\nSo ""BRIND"" might be a word? But I think ""drink"", ""brink"", ""briny"" are more common.\n\nAlso, ""QUINZ"" not a word.\n\nSo we\'ll stick to the main ones.\n\nNow, to decide: \n\nIf we guess ""DRINK"":\n   - If correct, we win.\n   - If not and D is correct? Then last letter must be something else? But D at first? Then we know the first letter is D, so the word is D R I N ? and only last letter to find? But we have candidates: if D is at first, then the word must be ""DRINK""? because no other D candidate? except ""DRINK"" itself? Or is there ""DRING"" not a word? So we might know it\'s incorrect? \n   Actually, if ""DRINK"" is guessed and the word has D at first, then we get D(?) and K(?) \n   But if the word is ""DRINK"", we get all correct? \n   Else, if D is correct and K is wrong, then we look for last letter: what words? D R I N ? with ? not K? And not eliminated letters? So ? must be B, D, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But in context: \n        D R I N ?  -> what words? ""DRINA"" is a river? Not common. ""DRINK"" we guessed. ""DRIVE"" but E eliminated and V not tested? Wait.\n\nBut in our pattern, we have no words with D at first except ""DRINK""? Because ""DRINK"" is the main word?\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""BRINK"", and it\'s wrong, but B is correct? Then we know B at first? And then last letter is not K? So we look for words: B R I N ? -> ""BRINY"" or ""BRINE"" but E eliminated? or ""BRING"" G eliminated? or ""BRIND""? So ""BRINY"" or ""BRIND"" if accepted.\n\nSo the information from D or B might not be sufficient? \n\nBut if we guess ""BRINY"", we test B and Y. If both correct, we win. If B correct, Y wrong? Then we know first letter B? and last letter must be K? Because ""BRINK"" would be the only common candidate? Similarly, if Y wrong and B wrong? Then we eliminate B and Y.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have many choices left? \n\nWe can also consider the frequency of first letters: B is more common than D? \n\nBut let\'s see what the feedback might give.\n\nWe have two major types: words ending in K (DRINK, BRINK, PRINK, WRINK) and words ending in Y (BRINY).\n\nWe can test a word that ends with K to see if that pattern is correct? \n\nBut we must guess one.\n\nI think ""DRINK"" is the most common word: it means to consume liquid. So I\'ll guess that.\n\nAlternatively, ""BRINK"" means edge, also common.\n\nBut ""DRINK"" is more frequent? \n\nWe can also consider that we haven\'t tested D? It might be better to test D? \n\nBut we have only one chance? Actually, we have three guesses? So we can guess ""DRINK"" now.\n\nIf it\'s correct, done.\nIf not, then:\n   - If D is correct at first? Then the word must be ""DRINK""? So we would get D(✓) and K(x) -> so last letter is not K? But we need to guess a different one? Then we could guess ""BRINY"" next? But D is fixed? So if D is correct and last letter is wrong? We don\'t know the last? So we have to try another one? \n\nLet\'s simulate:\n\nOption: Guess ""DRINK""\n   Feedback may be:\n      Case 1: D(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(✓) -> win.\n      Case 2: D(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(x) -> then we know first letter is D? Actually, D at position 1 is correct? So the word is D R I N ? and the last letter is not K? And not eliminated? So next possible words? \n          D R I N ? -> what words?\n          ""DRINY""? Not a word? \n          ""DRINA""? (proper noun, river) not likely?\n          So probably no word with D at first? Then we rule out D? But the feedback said D was at correct position? Then it must be D R I N ? and we have no candidate? Contradiction? \n\nActually, if we guess ""DRINK"" and get D(✓) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(x), then we know the word is D R I N ? with ? not K? But in the dictionary, are there such words? \n  - ""DRINK"" is the only common word? So this feedback might not occur? \n  Similarly, if we get D(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(✓), then D not at first? So the word has K at last? Then candidates: ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK""\n\nAnd we know D not in word? Because D at first was not present? So D eliminated? Then we have to choose among ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK"".\n\nSimilarly, if both D and K are wrong? Then D and K eliminated? Then candidates: ""BRINY"".\n\nSo, if we want to test K at the same time? We can test a word with K? \n\nBut we lose if we guess wrong.\n\nAn alternative strategy: guess a word that has letters not in any particular candidate? For example, guess ""BRINY"", which tests B and Y? If wrong, we eliminate B and Y? Then the word must be among ""DRINK"", ""BRINK"", etc? But we lose B and Y? \n\nIf we guess ""BRINY"":\n   Case 1: win.\n   Case 2: B(✓) and Y(x) -> then first letter B, last letter is not Y? Then must be K? So ""BRINK""?\n   Case 3: B(x) and Y(✓) -> then last letter Y? But if B not correct? Then the word is ? R I N Y? candidates: ""URINY""? not a word? ""BRINY"" is the main one? So must be ""BRINY"" with B wrong and Y correct? But first letter would be something else? But we don\'t have any other candidate? \n   Case 4: B(x) and Y(x) -> then we know the word ends with K? And first letter not B? So candidates: ""DRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK""\n\nGiven the possibilities, ""BRINY"" has only one common candidate? Unless we accept ""BRIND"" but not common.\n\nSo ""BRINY"" is a risky guess? If it\'s not correct, we might only narrow down to ending in K? But we don\'t know the first letter? We have to guess among ""DRINK"", ""BRINK"", etc.\n\nSo maybe guessing ""DRINK"" is better? Then if it\'s not correct, we may find out about K.\n\nWe have 3 guesses? We can afford one more.\n\nI think ""DRINK"" is a safe choice: if correct, we win. If not, we eliminate D and K? Or get partial.\n\nBut note: if we guess ""DRINK"", and say D is not in the word? Then K could be in the word? But in the feedback, if D is not in the word (x), and K is not in the word (x), then we eliminate D and K? Then the word must be like ""BRINY""? because all K-endings require K? So then ""BRINY"" becomes the only candidate? \n\nBut ""BRINK"", ""DRINK"", etc? If K is eliminated, then ""BRINY"" is the only one? \n\nSimilarly, if D is present but not at first? And K present? But we don\'t have any candidate with D not at first? \n\nSo after guessing ""DRINK"", the feedback can tell us:\n\n   - If D is correct at first? Then the word must be ""DRINK"" with K correct? But feedback K(x) -> impossible? Then we know the last letter is not K and must be? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps list all possible words again with the pattern _ R I N _ and no eliminated letters.\n\nPossible:\n\n  B R I N Y  -> BRINY\n  B R I N K  -> BRINK\n  D R I N K  -> DRINK\n  P R I N K  -> PRINK\n  W R I N K  -> WRINK\n  B R I N D  -> BRIND? (if accepted, meaning spotted or streaked, rare)\n  M R I N K  -> not a word? ""minK"" is different spelling.\n\nSo probably only a few candidates.\n\nTo maximize information, we might guess ""DRINK"", which tests D and K? If D is present and in position? Then the word is ""DRINK""? Because other words don\'t have D? So if D is at first? and the last letter is K? Then all correct? \n\nIf D is present but not at first? But in the pattern, we know D can only be at first? In all candidates, D is only at first in ""DRINK"". \n\nSimilarly, K is only at last in the K-ending words? So if K is in the word? Then it must be at the end? \n\nBut in the feedback, if we guess ""DRINK"", and K is in the word, but not at fifth, then it would be marked with a dash? \n\nFor example, if the word is ""BRINK"", and we guess ""DRINK"", then:\n\n   D: not in word? x\n   R: ✓\n   I: ✓\n   N: ✓\n   K: in word but at position 5? In ""DRINK"", K is at 5? In ""BRINK"", K is at 5? So if the word is ""BRINK"", then D is not in word (x), K is at same position? ✓.\n\nSo for ""DRINK"" guess:\n   - If the word is ""DRINK"": all ✓\n   - If the word is ""BRINK"": D(x) and K(✓)\n   - If the word is ""BRINY"": D(x) and K(x) -> also Y not in this guess? So Y would be ?\n\nFor ""BRINK"": we get D(x) and K(✓) -> so we know the word ends with K? But not D? So candidates are ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK"" -> three possibilities? But we know the first letter must not be D? But among B, P, W? \n\nThen next guess we can use one that tests one of them? \n\nFor example, if we get D(x) and K(✓), then we know the word is among ""BRINK"", ""PRINK"", ""WRINK"". Then we can guess ""BRINK"" next? \n\nSimilarly, if we get D(x) and K(x)? Then the word must be ""BRINY""? Because K is not in the word? So only candidate? Then we can guess ""BRINY"" next? \n\nSo guessing ""DRINK"" and then based on feedback, we can decide.\n\nThat seems efficient: we eliminate D and K? Or at least get information about them? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""DRINK"".\n\nGuess: ""DRINK"" \n\nAnd then we can proceed.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""DRINK"".\n\n<guess>drink</guess>\nBased on accumulated feedback:\n- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R I N _` (R in position 2, I in position 3, N in position 4).\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S (not in the word).\n- **Remaining possible words**: BRINY, BRINK, DRINK, PRINK, WRINK, etc.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- Focus on the most common word among candidates to potentially solve immediately.\n- **DRINK** is chosen because:\n  - Tests D (position 1) and K (position 5), both common unused letters.\n  - If correct, ends the game.\n  - If incorrect, feedback on D/K will narrow options significantly:\n    - If K is ✓, the word ends with K (e.g., BRINK, PRINK, WRINK).\n    - If K is x, BRINY is the primary candidate.\n    - D\'s feedback confirms/eliminates it as a starting letter.\n\nThis guess efficiently reduces the solution space with minimal risk.\n\n<guess>drink</guess>Based on previous feedback:\n- The secret word must match the pattern **\\_ R I N \\_**.\n- Eliminated letters: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S (absent from the word).\n- **DRINK** is a strong candidate:\n  - Fits the pattern (`D R I N K`).\n  - Tests high-frequency consonants (D and K) not yet evaluated.\n  - Common English word, maximizing solve potential.\n\nIf incorrect, feedback will confirm:\n- Whether D is in position 1 (✓/x).\n- Whether K is in position 5 (✓/x), narrowing to BRINY (if K is absent) or BRINK/PRINK/WRINK (if K is present).\n\n<guess>drink</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: front -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(x) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: grins -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) S(x)\nGuess 4: drink -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the fourth guess ""drink"":
  D(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(✓)

This means:
  - D is not in the word at all (x)
  - R is correct at position 2 (✓)
  - I is correct at position 3 (✓)
  - N is correct at position 4 (✓)
  - K is correct at position 5 (✓)

So the secret word is: _ R I N K

We know the word ends with ""K"", so the pattern is: [letter1] R I N K

Also, from previous feedback, we have eliminated: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S, and now D.

So the first letter must be one of the remaining letters: B, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we know the word is ""?RINK"", so common words are:
  - BRINK: B-R-I-N-K
  - PRINK: P-R-I-N-K
  - WRINK: W-R-I-N-K

Other possibilities? 
  - ""CRINK"" -> C is eliminated, invalid.
  - ""TRINK"" -> T eliminated, invalid.
  - ""KRINK"" -> not a common word? Probably not.
  - ""FRINK"" -> F eliminated, invalid.

So the main candidates are: BRINK, PRINK, WRINK.

We have three possibilities. We need to guess one of them.

We have 2 guesses left? We used 4, so 2 left.

We can guess ""BRINK"" because it's the most common word? Or we can try to test multiple at once? But we have to guess a 5-letter word that fits the pattern? Actually, we know the pattern is fixed: ? R I N K.

So we must guess one of these three.

We can choose ""BRINK"" as it is the most common.

But note: we haven't tested B, P, W? So we don't know which one.

But we can only guess one.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that uses B, P, W? But we are constrained to the pattern? We have to have R at 2, I at 3, N at 4, K at 5? So the only thing we can change is the first letter? And we have to choose one.

So we must pick one of the three.

We can start with ""BRINK"" because it's the most frequent.

If it's correct, done. If not, then we know the first letter is not B? Then we can choose between P and W.

So I'll go with ""BRINK"".

Guess: ""BRINK""

But let's confirm: if we guess ""BRINK"", and it's wrong? Then we get B(x) and the rest? But R, I, N, K are already known? So we get B(x) and then we know the word is either ""PRINK"" or ""WRINK"".

Then we can guess ""PRINK"" next? Or ""WRINK"".

So it's efficient.

We could guess ""PRINK"" first? But ""BRINK"" is more common.

So I choose ""BRINK"".

### Analysis of Feedback:
- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is `_ R I N K` (positions 2–5 fixed: R, I, N, K).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, E, F, O, T, G, S, D (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Key insight**: Only the first letter remains unknown. It must be a letter not eliminated and form a valid word with ""RINK"".

### Possible Words:
- **BRINK** (B at start)  
- **PRINK** (P at start)  
- **WRINK** (W at start)  

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- **BRINK** is the most common word among the candidates. Guessing it first maximizes the chance of solving immediately.
- If incorrect, feedback on B will confirm if it's present/absent, narrowing the solution to **PRINK** or **WRINK** for the final guess.
