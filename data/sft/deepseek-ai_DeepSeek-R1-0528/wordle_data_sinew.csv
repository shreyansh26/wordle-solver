First, I have the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-).

This means:

- C is not in the secret word.

- R is not in the secret word.

- A is not in the secret word.

- N is in the word but in the wrong position.

- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, the secret word contains N and E, but not in the positions they were guessed. Since ""CRANE"" had N as the fourth letter and E as the fifth, but they're both in the wrong position, that means N is not in the fourth position, and E is not in the fifth position in the secret word. Also, since C, R, and A are absent, they can't be in the word at all.

Now, N and E are present in the word. Since their positions are wrong, and we have no clue about where they might be, except they can't be in the 4th or 5th spots if that was their guessed position.

In ""CRANE"", N is position 4 (index 4 if we count from 1), and E is position 5. So position indices: 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E.

Feedback:

- Position 1: C is absent → no C in word

- Position 2: R is absent → no R in word

- Position 3: A is absent → no A in word

- Position 4: N is present but wrong position → N is in word but not at position 4

- Position 5: E is present but wrong position → E is in word but not at position 5

Therefore, the secret word has N and E in it, but not at position 4 or 5. Also, it has no C, no R, no A.

For my next guess, I need to use this information. I should choose a word that includes N and E in different positions to try and pin down their correct spots. Also, since C, R, A are excluded, I should avoid them.

N is not at position 4, and E is not at position 5. So for N, it could be in positions 1,2,3 since there are only 5 positions. Similarly for E, it could be in positions 1,2,3,4? But position 5 is out, so 1,2,3,4 are possible for E.

Positions are 1,2,3,4,5. For N, it can't be in 4, so possible positions: 1,2,3,5.

For E, it can't be in 5, so possible positions: 1,2,3,4.

But E also can't be in position 5, that's confirmed, but since it's not at 5, it could be elsewhere.

Also, since both N and E are present, I need a word that has both.

Moreover, I should try to include other common letters that are not C, R, A to gather more information.

Let me think of words that have N and E, and no C, R, A.

Common vowels and consonants: S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

N is a consonant, E is a vowel.

Possible words: like ""STONE"", but R is not allowed? R is absent, so can't have R.

In ""STONE"": S,T,O,N,E. Let me check if all are okay.

S: not prohibited yet

T: not prohibited

O: not prohibited

N: good

E: good

And no C, R, A, so that seems fine.

""STONE"" position: S1, T2, O3, N4, E5.

But in the feedback, N was guessed at position 4 and is wrong position, so N cannot be at position 4, similarly E cannot be at 5.

If I guess ""STONE"", it has N at position 4 and E at position 5. But since N is wrong at 4 and E wrong at 5, if I guess the same positions, it might give the same feedback.

It could be that N is in word but not at 4, so guessing N at 4 again might get ""-"" or ""x"" if it's not there, but since we know N is in word, it should be ""-"" if not at correct position.

Similarly for E.

But I need to put them in different positions to test other spots.

For example, if I put N in position 1 or something.

Let me think.

Perhaps a word like ""HONEY"", but Y? Let's see.

Better to use common words.

Another idea: ""LINES"". L-I-N-E-S.

But E is at position 4? Positions: L1, I2, N3, E4, S5.

Feedback from first guess: N cannot be at position 4, which was the 4th position. So in ""LINES"", N is at position 3, which is different, and E is at position 4.

E cannot be at position 5, but position 4 might be possible.

Similarly, N is at position 3, which wasn't tested before.

Also, letters: L, I, N, E, S. No C,R,A.

N and E are both included.

In secret word, N is not at position 4, but it could be at 3 or 1 or 2.

Similarly, E not at 5, could be elsewhere.

So ""LINES"" might be a good guess to test N and E in new positions.

If N is at position 3, and if it's correct, I get ✓ for that position.

Similarly, E at position 4.

Also, introducing L, I, S.

S is common.

""BLEND"" has B,L,E,N,D — but E at position 3, N at position 4? Position: B1,L2,E3,N4,D5.

Again N at position 4, which we know is wrong, so it should come back as ""-"" since N is present but position wrong.

Similarly E at position 3, which wasn't E's position in first guess; E was at 5.

But we need to move E to a different position.

Perhaps avoid putting N at position 4 or E at position 5 again.

In ""STONE"", N is at 4, E at 5, exactly the wrong positions we know, so it might not be efficient.

Better to guess a word where N and E are in positions that are possible.

Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5

Possible for E: 1,2,3,4

So let's put N in a new position, say position 1, and E in position 2 or something.

Words like ""NEEDS"" but E repeated? N-E-E-D-S, but E twice, which might not be ideal if secret word has only one E.

We don't know if there are repeated letters, but often Wordle words have distinct letters, but not always. Feedback doesn't show multiplicity, but it can be inferred.

In this case, since E was marked present but wrong position, it could be that E appears once or multiple times, but we don't know. Similarly for N.

But often, to avoid complexity, we can assume no repetition for now.

In first guess ""CRANE"", all letters unique, and feedback shows N and E present.

For simplicity, let's assume the secret word has N and E only once each, but we might be wrong.

But I think it's safe to start with that.

So, guess a word with N and E in different positions.

Also, include other common consonants like S, T, L.

Try ""SINCE"" but C is excluded? C is absent, can't use C.

C is out.

""MINTS"" M-I-N-T-S, positions: M1,I2,N3,T4,S5 — N at 3, but no E here. E is needed.

E must be in the word, so I need a word with E.

""QUEST"" Q-U-E-S-T, but Q and U might be less common, and A is out, but Q U E S T.

S at position 4, E at 3, etc.

But I have N to place also.

N is also in the word, so I need both N and E.

So words containing N and E.

Like ""PHONE"", but P H O N E — positions P1,H2,O3,N4,E5 — again N at 4 and E at 5, which are the known wrong positions.

Since we know position 4 and 5 are wrong for N and E respectively, guessing them there again will likely give ""-"" for both, which doesn't help pinpoint their locations. So better to change positions.

For example, guess a word with N at position 1 or 2 or 3 or 5, but position 5 is possible for N? Position 5 for N: earlier E was at 5, but N could be at 5.

In feedback, position 5 had E and was wrong, but for N, it can be at 5, since N was at 4.

Similarly, E can be at 4.

So let's list possible positions:

For N: positions 1,2,3,5 (since not 4)

For E: positions 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)

Now, in the word, N and E are not necessarily in these positions yet, but must be somewhere.

For my guess, to test, I should put N in a position not tried, say position 1 or 2.

Similarly for E, put in position 2 or 3.

Also, to avoid wasting letters, choose a word with other new letters.

Word with N at start: ""NEVER"" but E repeated; ""NEEDS"" repeated.

""NICER"" but C and R are out — C absent, R absent.

""NOISE"" N-O-I-S-E — positions: N1,O2,I3,S4,E5.

E is at position 5, but we know E cannot be at position 5 from feedback.

In first guess, E was at position 5 and wrong, so if I guess E at position 5 again, it will be wrong position still, unless the secret word has E at 5, but feedback says it's wrong position, so it can't be at 5.

Thus, guessing E at position 5 again would give ""-"" because E is present but not at that position.

But to confirm or to avoid, it's better not to guess known wrong positions if possible.

In ""NOISE"", E is at 5, which is known wrong.

So N is at 1, which is new.

S at 4, E at 5.

E at 5 is bad position.

Better to choose a word where E is not at 5 and N not at 4.

For example, ""STEIN"" S-T-E-I-N — positions: S1,T2,E3,I4,N5.

N at position 5? Position indices: S=1, T=2, E=3, I=4, N=5.

N at 5, E at 3.

N: position 5 is possible since not tried before; position 4 was tried for N and wrong.

E at position 3, which is new.

So this could work.

Letters: S, T, E, I, N — all fine, no C,R,A.

And N and E both included.

Moreover, common letters.

""STEIN"" is a common word in Wordle.

A synonym for beer mug or something, but it's a word.

So let's go with that.

After guessing, I'll get feedback on S,T,E,I,N.

Possible outcomes, but I'll know where N and E might be if they are correct here.

For example, if E at position 3 is correct, I get ✓, else if present but wrong, - , or absent, but we know E is present.

Similarly for N.

Also, I might discover other letters.

So ""STEIN"" seems a good second guess.

Another option: ""BEGIN"" B-E-G-I-N — positions B1,E2,G3,I4,N5 — E at 2, N at 5.

Also good, similar.

""STEIN"" has S and T, which are common.

Or ""SPINE"" S-P-I-N-E, positions S1,P2,I3,N4,E5 — N at position 4 again, which we know is wrong, so N at 4 will give ""-"" for sure, which wastes the guess; similarly E at 5 will give ""-"".

So avoid putting N at 4 or E at 5.

Thus, ""STEIN"" with E at 3 and N at 5 is better than ""SPINE"".

""SLING"" S-L-I-N-G, no E.

Must include E.

""TEENS"" has E repeated.

So ""STEIN"" seems fine.

Or ""MEANT"" but A is absent, can't use A.

A is out.

or ""JOINT"" J-O-I-N-T, no E.

Need E.

So settle on ""STEIN"".

Guess: ""STEIN""

Now for response format.

First, I need to return it in <guess>stein</guess>

But let's confirm the thought process.

Thought process summary:

Previous feedback: C absent, R absent, A absent, N present but wrong position (not position 4), E present but wrong position (not position 5).

Thus, secret word contains N and E, no C, no R, no A.

For next guess, choose a word with N and E in positions other than 4 or 5 respectively, to test new positions.

Chose ""STEIN"" with positions: S=1, T=2, E=3, I=4, N=5.

Thus, E is at position 3, which is possible, and N at position 5, which is possible.

Introduces S, T, I.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- C is absent (x) → Secret word has no C.  
- R is absent (x) → Secret word has no R.  
- A is absent (x) → Secret word has no A.  
- N is present but in the wrong position (-) → Secret word contains N, but not at position 4.  
- E is present but in the wrong position (-) → Secret word contains E, but not at position 5.  

Key deductions:  
- The secret word includes N and E, but N cannot be at position 4, and E cannot be at position 5.  
- Excluded letters: C, R, A (cannot be used).  
- Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
- Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
- Goal for this guess: Include N and E in new, untested positions to refine their locations, while introducing new common letters like S, T, or I.  

Chose ""STEIN"" because:  
- It places E at position 3 (a new, untested position).  
- It places N at position 5 (a new, untested position).  
- No excluded letters (C, R, A are avoided).  
- Includes letters S, T, and I, which are common and could provide additional clues.  
- Avoids repeating known wrong positions for N (position 4) or E (position 5), maximizing information gain.  

This guess should help determine if E is at position 3 or N is at position 5, while testing other letters for presence and position.  

<guess>stein</guess>",stein,"First, I have the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-).

This means:

- C is not in the secret word.

- R is not in the secret word.

- A is not in the secret word.

- N is in the word but in the wrong position.

- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, the secret word contains N and E, but not in the positions they were guessed. Since ""CRANE"" had N as the fourth letter and E as the fifth, but they're both in the wrong position, that means N is not in the fourth position, and E is not in the fifth position in the secret word. Also, since C, R, and A are absent, they can't be in the word at all.

Now, N and E are present in the word. Since their positions are wrong, and we have no clue about where they might be, except they can't be in the 4th or 5th spots if that was their guessed position.

In ""CRANE"", N is position 4 (index 4 if we count from 1), and E is position 5. So position indices: 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E.

Feedback:

- Position 1: C is absent → no C in word

- Position 2: R is absent → no R in word

- Position 3: A is absent → no A in word

- Position 4: N is present but wrong position → N is in word but not at position 4

- Position 5: E is present but wrong position → E is in word but not at position 5

Therefore, the secret word has N and E in it, but not at position 4 or 5. Also, it has no C, no R, no A.

For my next guess, I need to use this information. I should choose a word that includes N and E in different positions to try and pin down their correct spots. Also, since C, R, A are excluded, I should avoid them.

N is not at position 4, and E is not at position 5. So for N, it could be in positions 1,2,3 since there are only 5 positions. Similarly for E, it could be in positions 1,2,3,4? But position 5 is out, so 1,2,3,4 are possible for E.

Positions are 1,2,3,4,5. For N, it can't be in 4, so possible positions: 1,2,3,5.

For E, it can't be in 5, so possible positions: 1,2,3,4.

But E also can't be in position 5, that's confirmed, but since it's not at 5, it could be elsewhere.

Also, since both N and E are present, I need a word that has both.

Moreover, I should try to include other common letters that are not C, R, A to gather more information.

Let me think of words that have N and E, and no C, R, A.

Common vowels and consonants: S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

N is a consonant, E is a vowel.

Possible words: like ""STONE"", but R is not allowed? R is absent, so can't have R.

In ""STONE"": S,T,O,N,E. Let me check if all are okay.

S: not prohibited yet

T: not prohibited

O: not prohibited

N: good

E: good

And no C, R, A, so that seems fine.

""STONE"" position: S1, T2, O3, N4, E5.

But in the feedback, N was guessed at position 4 and is wrong position, so N cannot be at position 4, similarly E cannot be at 5.

If I guess ""STONE"", it has N at position 4 and E at position 5. But since N is wrong at 4 and E wrong at 5, if I guess the same positions, it might give the same feedback.

It could be that N is in word but not at 4, so guessing N at 4 again might get ""-"" or ""x"" if it's not there, but since we know N is in word, it should be ""-"" if not at correct position.

Similarly for E.

But I need to put them in different positions to test other spots.

For example, if I put N in position 1 or something.

Let me think.

Perhaps a word like ""HONEY"", but Y? Let's see.

Better to use common words.

Another idea: ""LINES"". L-I-N-E-S.

But E is at position 4? Positions: L1, I2, N3, E4, S5.

Feedback from first guess: N cannot be at position 4, which was the 4th position. So in ""LINES"", N is at position 3, which is different, and E is at position 4.

E cannot be at position 5, but position 4 might be possible.

Similarly, N is at position 3, which wasn't tested before.

Also, letters: L, I, N, E, S. No C,R,A.

N and E are both included.

In secret word, N is not at position 4, but it could be at 3 or 1 or 2.

Similarly, E not at 5, could be elsewhere.

So ""LINES"" might be a good guess to test N and E in new positions.

If N is at position 3, and if it's correct, I get ✓ for that position.

Similarly, E at position 4.

Also, introducing L, I, S.

S is common.

""BLEND"" has B,L,E,N,D — but E at position 3, N at position 4? Position: B1,L2,E3,N4,D5.

Again N at position 4, which we know is wrong, so it should come back as ""-"" since N is present but position wrong.

Similarly E at position 3, which wasn't E's position in first guess; E was at 5.

But we need to move E to a different position.

Perhaps avoid putting N at position 4 or E at position 5 again.

In ""STONE"", N is at 4, E at 5, exactly the wrong positions we know, so it might not be efficient.

Better to guess a word where N and E are in positions that are possible.

Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5

Possible for E: 1,2,3,4

So let's put N in a new position, say position 1, and E in position 2 or something.

Words like ""NEEDS"" but E repeated? N-E-E-D-S, but E twice, which might not be ideal if secret word has only one E.

So, guess a word with N and E in different positions.

Also, include other common consonants like S, T, L.

Try ""SINCE"" but C is excluded? C is absent, can't use C.

C is out.

""MINTS"" M-I-N-T-S, positions: M1,I2,N3,T4,S5 — N at 3, but no E here. E is needed.

E must be in the word, so I need a word with E.

""QUEST"" Q-U-E-S-T, but Q and U might be less common, and A is out, but Q U E S T.

S at position 4, E at 3, etc.

But I have N to place also.

N is also in the word, so I need both N and E.

So words containing N and E.

Like ""PHONE"", but P H O N E — positions P1,H2,O3,N4,E5 — again N at 4 and E at 5, which are the known wrong positions.

Since we know position 4 and 5 are wrong for N and E respectively, guessing them there again will likely give ""-"" for both, which doesn't help pinpoint their locations. So better to change positions.

For example, guess a word with N at position 1 or 2 or 3 or 5, but position 5 is possible for N? Position 5 for N: earlier E was at 5, but N could be at 5.

In feedback, position 5 had E and was wrong, but for N, it can be at 5, since N was at 4.

Similarly, E can be at 4.

So let's list possible positions:

For N: positions 1,2,3,5 (since not 4)

For E: positions 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)

Now, in the word, N and E are not necessarily in these positions yet, but must be somewhere.

For my guess, to test, I should put N in a position not tried, say position 1 or 2.

Similarly for E, put in position 2 or 3.

Also, to avoid wasting letters, choose a word with other new letters.

Word with N at start: ""NEVER"" but E repeated; ""NEEDS"" repeated.

""NICER"" but C and R are out — C absent, R absent.

""NOISE"" N-O-I-S-E — positions: N1,O2,I3,S4,E5.

E is at position 5, but we know E cannot be at position 5 from feedback.

In first guess, E was at position 5 and wrong, so if I guess E at position 5 again, it will be wrong position still, unless the secret word has E at 5, but feedback says it's wrong position, so it can't be at 5.

Thus, guessing E at position 5 again would give ""-"" because E is present but not at that position.

But to confirm or to avoid, it's better not to guess known wrong positions if possible.

In ""NOISE"", E is at 5, which is known wrong.

So N is at 1, which is new.

S at 4, E at 5.

E at 5 is bad position.

Better to choose a word where E is not at 5 and N not at 4.

For example, ""STEIN"" S-T-E-I-N — positions: S1,T2,E3,I4,N5.

N at position 5? Position indices: S=1, T=2, E=3, I=4, N=5.

N at 5, E at 3.

N: position 5 is possible since not tried before; position 4 was tried for N and wrong.

E at position 3, which is new.

So this could work.

Letters: S, T, E, I, N — all fine, no C,R,A.

And N and E both included.

Moreover, common letters.

""STEIN"" is a common word in Wordle.

A synonym for beer mug or something, but it's a word.

So let's go with that.

After guessing, I'll get feedback on S,T,E,I,N.

Possible outcomes, but I'll know where N and E might be if they are correct here.

For example, if E at position 3 is correct, I get ✓, else if present but wrong, - , or absent, but we know E is present.

Similarly for N.

Also, I might discover other letters.

So ""STEIN"" seems a good second guess.

Another option: ""BEGIN"" B-E-G-I-N — positions B1,E2,G3,I4,N5 — E at 2, N at 5.

Also good, similar.

""STEIN"" has S and T, which are common.

Or ""SPINE"" S-P-I-N-E, positions S1,P2,I3,N4,E5 — N at position 4 again, which we know is wrong, so N at 4 will give ""-"" for sure, which wastes the guess; similarly E at 5 will give ""-"".

So avoid putting N at 4 or E at 5.

Thus, ""STEIN"" with E at 3 and N at 5 is better than ""SPINE"".

""SLING"" S-L-I-N-G, no E.

Must include E.

""TEENS"" has E repeated.

So ""STEIN"" seems fine.

Or ""MEANT"" but A is absent, can't use A.

A is out.

or ""JOINT"" J-O-I-N-T, no E.

Need E.

So settle on ""STEIN"".

Guess: ""STEIN""

Now for response format.

First, I need to return it in <guess>stein</guess>

But let's confirm the thought process.

Thought process summary:

Previous feedback: C absent, R absent, A absent, N present but wrong position (not position 4), E present but wrong position (not position 5).

Thus, secret word contains N and E, no C, no R, no A.

For next guess, choose a word with N and E in positions other than 4 or 5 respectively, to test new positions.

Chose ""STEIN"" with positions: S=1, T=2, E=3, I=4, N=5.

Thus, E is at position 3, which is possible, and N at position 5, which is possible.

Introduces S, T, I.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- C is absent (x) → Secret word has no C.  
- R is absent (x) → Secret word has no R.  
- A is absent (x) → Secret word has no A.  
- N is present but in the wrong position (-) → Secret word contains N, but not at position 4.  
- E is present but in the wrong position (-) → Secret word contains E, but not at position 5.  

Key deductions:  
- The secret word includes N and E, but N cannot be at position 4, and E cannot be at position 5.  
- Excluded letters: C, R, A (cannot be used).  
- Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
- Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
- Goal for this guess: Include N and E in new, untested positions to refine their locations, while introducing new common letters like S, T, or I.  

Chose ""STEIN"" because:  
- It places E at position 3 (a new, untested position).  
- It places N at position 5 (a new, untested position).  
- No excluded letters (C, R, A are avoided).  
- Includes letters S, T, and I, which are common and could provide additional clues.  
- Avoids repeating known wrong positions for N (position 4) or E (position 5), maximizing information gain.  

This guess should help determine if E is at position 3 or N is at position 5, while testing other letters for presence and position.",Guess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,sinew,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I have the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-).

This means:

- C is not in the secret word.

- R is not in the secret word.

- A is not in the secret word.

- N is in the word but in the wrong position.

- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, the secret word contains N and E, but not in the positions they were guessed. Since ""CRANE"" had N as the fourth letter and E as the fifth, but they're both in the wrong position, that means N is not in the fourth position, and E is not in the fifth position in the secret word. Also, since C, R, and A are absent, they can't be in the word at all.

Now, N and E are present in the word. Since their positions are wrong, and we have no clue about where they might be, except they can't be in the 4th or 5th spots if that was their guessed position.

In ""CRANE"", N is position 4 (index 4 if we count from 1), and E is position 5. So position indices: 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E.

Feedback:

- Position 1: C is absent → no C in word

- Position 2: R is absent → no R in word

- Position 3: A is absent → no A in word

- Position 4: N is present but wrong position → N is in word but not at position 4

- Position 5: E is present but wrong position → E is in word but not at position 5

Therefore, the secret word has N and E in it, but not at position 4 or 5. Also, it has no C, no R, no A.

For my next guess, I need to use this information. I should choose a word that includes N and E in different positions to try and pin down their correct spots. Also, since C, R, A are excluded, I should avoid them.

N is not at position 4, and E is not at position 5. So for N, it could be in positions 1,2,3 since there are only 5 positions. Similarly for E, it could be in positions 1,2,3,4? But position 5 is out, so 1,2,3,4 are possible for E.

Positions are 1,2,3,4,5. For N, it can't be in 4, so possible positions: 1,2,3,5.

For E, it can't be in 5, so possible positions: 1,2,3,4.

But E also can't be in position 5, that's confirmed, but since it's not at 5, it could be elsewhere.

Also, since both N and E are present, I need a word that has both.

Moreover, I should try to include other common letters that are not C, R, A to gather more information.

Let me think of words that have N and E, and no C, R, A.

Common vowels and consonants: S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

N is a consonant, E is a vowel.

Possible words: like ""STONE"", but R is not allowed? R is absent, so can't have R.

In ""STONE"": S,T,O,N,E. Let me check if all are okay.

S: not prohibited yet

T: not prohibited

O: not prohibited

N: good

E: good

And no C, R, A, so that seems fine.

""STONE"" position: S1, T2, O3, N4, E5.

But in the feedback, N was guessed at position 4 and is wrong position, so N cannot be at position 4, similarly E cannot be at 5.

If I guess ""STONE"", it has N at position 4 and E at position 5. But since N is wrong at 4 and E wrong at 5, if I guess the same positions, it might give the same feedback.

It could be that N is in word but not at 4, so guessing N at 4 again might get ""-"" or ""x"" if it's not there, but since we know N is in word, it should be ""-"" if not at correct position.

Similarly for E.

But I need to put them in different positions to test other spots.

For example, if I put N in position 1 or something.

Let me think.

Perhaps a word like ""HONEY"", but Y? Let's see.

Better to use common words.

Another idea: ""LINES"". L-I-N-E-S.

But E is at position 4? Positions: L1, I2, N3, E4, S5.

Feedback from first guess: N cannot be at position 4, which was the 4th position. So in ""LINES"", N is at position 3, which is different, and E is at position 4.

E cannot be at position 5, but position 4 might be possible.

Similarly, N is at position 3, which wasn't tested before.

Also, letters: L, I, N, E, S. No C,R,A.

N and E are both included.

In secret word, N is not at position 4, but it could be at 3 or 1 or 2.

Similarly, E not at 5, could be elsewhere.

So ""LINES"" might be a good guess to test N and E in new positions.

If N is at position 3, and if it's correct, I get ✓ for that position.

Similarly, E at position 4.

Also, introducing L, I, S.

S is common.

""BLEND"" has B,L,E,N,D — but E at position 3, N at position 4? Position: B1,L2,E3,N4,D5.

Again N at position 4, which we know is wrong, so it should come back as ""-"" since N is present but position wrong.

Similarly E at position 3, which wasn't E's position in first guess; E was at 5.

But we need to move E to a different position.

Perhaps avoid putting N at position 4 or E at position 5 again.

In ""STONE"", N is at 4, E at 5, exactly the wrong positions we know, so it might not be efficient.

Better to guess a word where N and E are in positions that are possible.

Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5

Possible for E: 1,2,3,4

So let's put N in a new position, say position 1, and E in position 2 or something.

Words like ""NEEDS"" but E repeated? N-E-E-D-S, but E twice, which might not be ideal if secret word has only one E.

We don't know if there are repeated letters, but often Wordle words have distinct letters, but not always. Feedback doesn't show multiplicity, but it can be inferred.

In this case, since E was marked present but wrong position, it could be that E appears once or multiple times, but we don't know. Similarly for N.

But often, to avoid complexity, we can assume no repetition for now.

In first guess ""CRANE"", all letters unique, and feedback shows N and E present.

For simplicity, let's assume the secret word has N and E only once each, but we might be wrong.

But I think it's safe to start with that.

So, guess a word with N and E in different positions.

Also, include other common consonants like S, T, L.

Try ""SINCE"" but C is excluded? C is absent, can't use C.

C is out.

""MINTS"" M-I-N-T-S, positions: M1,I2,N3,T4,S5 — N at 3, but no E here. E is needed.

E must be in the word, so I need a word with E.

""QUEST"" Q-U-E-S-T, but Q and U might be less common, and A is out, but Q U E S T.

S at position 4, E at 3, etc.

But I have N to place also.

N is also in the word, so I need both N and E.

So words containing N and E.

Like ""PHONE"", but P H O N E — positions P1,H2,O3,N4,E5 — again N at 4 and E at 5, which are the known wrong positions.

Since we know position 4 and 5 are wrong for N and E respectively, guessing them there again will likely give ""-"" for both, which doesn't help pinpoint their locations. So better to change positions.

For example, guess a word with N at position 1 or 2 or 3 or 5, but position 5 is possible for N? Position 5 for N: earlier E was at 5, but N could be at 5.

In feedback, position 5 had E and was wrong, but for N, it can be at 5, since N was at 4.

Similarly, E can be at 4.

So let's list possible positions:

For N: positions 1,2,3,5 (since not 4)

For E: positions 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)

Now, in the word, N and E are not necessarily in these positions yet, but must be somewhere.

For my guess, to test, I should put N in a position not tried, say position 1 or 2.

Similarly for E, put in position 2 or 3.

Also, to avoid wasting letters, choose a word with other new letters.

Word with N at start: ""NEVER"" but E repeated; ""NEEDS"" repeated.

""NICER"" but C and R are out — C absent, R absent.

""NOISE"" N-O-I-S-E — positions: N1,O2,I3,S4,E5.

E is at position 5, but we know E cannot be at position 5 from feedback.

In first guess, E was at position 5 and wrong, so if I guess E at position 5 again, it will be wrong position still, unless the secret word has E at 5, but feedback says it's wrong position, so it can't be at 5.

Thus, guessing E at position 5 again would give ""-"" because E is present but not at that position.

But to confirm or to avoid, it's better not to guess known wrong positions if possible.

In ""NOISE"", E is at 5, which is known wrong.

So N is at 1, which is new.

S at 4, E at 5.

E at 5 is bad position.

Better to choose a word where E is not at 5 and N not at 4.

For example, ""STEIN"" S-T-E-I-N — positions: S1,T2,E3,I4,N5.

N at position 5? Position indices: S=1, T=2, E=3, I=4, N=5.

N at 5, E at 3.

N: position 5 is possible since not tried before; position 4 was tried for N and wrong.

E at position 3, which is new.

So this could work.

Letters: S, T, E, I, N — all fine, no C,R,A.

And N and E both included.

Moreover, common letters.

""STEIN"" is a common word in Wordle.

A synonym for beer mug or something, but it's a word.

So let's go with that.

After guessing, I'll get feedback on S,T,E,I,N.

Possible outcomes, but I'll know where N and E might be if they are correct here.

For example, if E at position 3 is correct, I get ✓, else if present but wrong, - , or absent, but we know E is present.

Similarly for N.

Also, I might discover other letters.

So ""STEIN"" seems a good second guess.

Another option: ""BEGIN"" B-E-G-I-N — positions B1,E2,G3,I4,N5 — E at 2, N at 5.

Also good, similar.

""STEIN"" has S and T, which are common.

Or ""SPINE"" S-P-I-N-E, positions S1,P2,I3,N4,E5 — N at position 4 again, which we know is wrong, so N at 4 will give ""-"" for sure, which wastes the guess; similarly E at 5 will give ""-"".

So avoid putting N at 4 or E at 5.

Thus, ""STEIN"" with E at 3 and N at 5 is better than ""SPINE"".

""SLING"" S-L-I-N-G, no E.

Must include E.

""TEENS"" has E repeated.

So ""STEIN"" seems fine.

Or ""MEANT"" but A is absent, can't use A.

A is out.

or ""JOINT"" J-O-I-N-T, no E.

Need E.

So settle on ""STEIN"".

Position: B1,L2,E3,N4,D5.\n\nAgain N at position 4, which we know is wrong, so it should come back as ""-"" since N is present but position wrong.\n\nSimilarly E at position 3, which wasn\'t E\'s position in first guess; E was at 5.\n\nBut we need to move E to a different position.\n\nPerhaps avoid putting N at position 4 or E at position 5 again.\n\nIn ""STONE"", N is at 4, E at 5, exactly the wrong positions we know, so it might not be efficient.\n\nBetter to guess a word where N and E are in positions that are possible.\n\nPossible positions for N: 1,2,3,5\n\nPossible for E: 1,2,3,4\n\nSo let\'s put N in a new position, say position 1, and E in position 2 or something.\n\nWords like ""NEEDS"" but E repeated? N-E-E-D-S, but E twice, which might not be ideal if secret word has only one E.\n\nWe don\'t know if there are repeated letters, but often Wordle words have distinct letters, but not always. Feedback doesn\'t show multiplicity, but it can be inferred.\n\nIn this case, since E was marked present but wrong position, it could be that E appears once or multiple times, but we don\'t know. Similarly for N.\n\nBut often, to avoid complexity, we can assume no repetition for now.\n\nIn first guess ""CRANE"", all letters unique, and feedback shows N and E present.\n\nFor simplicity, let\'s assume the secret word has N and E only once each, but we might be wrong.\n\nBut I think it\'s safe to start with that.\n\nSo, guess a word with N and E in different positions.\n\nAlso, include other common consonants like S, T, L.\n\nTry ""SINCE"" but C is excluded? C is absent, can\'t use C.\n\nC is out.\n\n""MINTS"" M-I-N-T-S, positions: M1,I2,N3,T4,S5 — N at 3, but no E here. E is needed.\n\nE must be in the word, so I need a word with E.\n\n""QUEST"" Q-U-E-S-T, but Q and U might be less common, and A is out, but Q U E S T.\n\nS at position 4, E at 3, etc.\n\nBut I have N to place also.\n\nN is also in the word, so I need both N and E.\n\nSo words containing N and E.\n\nLike ""PHONE"", but P H O N E — positions P1,H2,O3,N4,E5 — again N at 4 and E at 5, which are the known wrong positions.\n\nSince we know position 4 and 5 are wrong for N and E respectively, guessing them there again will likely give ""-"" for both, which doesn\'t help pinpoint their locations. So better to change positions.\n\nFor example, guess a word with N at position 1 or 2 or 3 or 5, but position 5 is possible for N? Position 5 for N: earlier E was at 5, but N could be at 5.\n\nIn feedback, position 5 had E and was wrong, but for N, it can be at 5, since N was at 4.\n\nSimilarly, E can be at 4.\n\nSo let\'s list possible positions:\n\nFor N: positions 1,2,3,5 (since not 4)\n\nFor E: positions 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)\n\nNow, in the word, N and E are not necessarily in these positions yet, but must be somewhere.\n\nFor my guess, to test, I should put N in a position not tried, say position 1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly for E, put in position 2 or 3.\n\nAlso, to avoid wasting letters, choose a word with other new letters.\n\nWord with N at start: ""NEVER"" but E repeated; ""NEEDS"" repeated.\n\n""NICER"" but C and R are out — C absent, R absent.\n\n""NOISE"" N-O-I-S-E — positions: N1,O2,I3,S4,E5.\n\nE is at position 5, but we know E cannot be at position 5 from feedback.\n\nIn first guess, E was at position 5 and wrong, so if I guess E at position 5 again, it will be wrong position still, unless the secret word has E at 5, but feedback says it\'s wrong position, so it can\'t be at 5.\n\nThus, guessing E at position 5 again would give ""-"" because E is present but not at that position.\n\nBut to confirm or to avoid, it\'s better not to guess known wrong positions if possible.\n\nIn ""NOISE"", E is at 5, which is known wrong.\n\nSo N is at 1, which is new.\n\nS at 4, E at 5.\n\nE at 5 is bad position.\n\nBetter to choose a word where E is not at 5 and N not at 4.\n\nFor example, ""STEIN"" S-T-E-I-N — positions: S1,T2,E3,I4,N5.\n\nN at position 5? Position indices: S=1, T=2, E=3, I=4, N=5.\n\nN at 5, E at 3.\n\nN: position 5 is possible since not tried before; position 4 was tried for N and wrong.\n\nE at position 3, which is new.\n\nSo this could work.\n\nLetters: S, T, E, I, N — all fine, no C,R,A.\n\nAnd N and E both included.\n\nMoreover, common letters.\n\n""STEIN"" is a common word in Wordle.\n\nA synonym for beer mug or something, but it\'s a word.\n\nSo let\'s go with that.\n\nAfter guessing, I\'ll get feedback on S,T,E,I,N.\n\nPossible outcomes, but I\'ll know where N and E might be if they are correct here.\n\nFor example, if E at position 3 is correct, I get ✓, else if present but wrong, - , or absent, but we know E is present.\n\nSimilarly for N.\n\nAlso, I might discover other letters.\n\nSo ""STEIN"" seems a good second guess.\n\nAnother option: ""BEGIN"" B-E-G-I-N — positions B1,E2,G3,I4,N5 — E at 2, N at 5.\n\nAlso good, similar.\n\n""STEIN"" has S and T, which are common.\n\nOr ""SPINE"" S-P-I-N-E, positions S1,P2,I3,N4,E5 — N at position 4 again, which we know is wrong, so N at 4 will give ""-"" for sure, which wastes the guess; similarly E at 5 will give ""-"".\n\nSo avoid putting N at 4 or E at 5.\n\nThus, ""STEIN"" with E at 3 and N at 5 is better than ""SPINE"".\n\n""SLING"" S-L-I-N-G, no E.\n\nMust include E.\n\n""TEENS"" has E repeated.\n\nSo ""STEIN"" seems fine.\n\nOr ""MEANT"" but A is absent, can\'t use A.\n\nA is out.\n\nor ""JOINT"" J-O-I-N-T, no E.\n\nNeed E.\n\nSo settle on ""STEIN"".\n\nGuess: ""STEIN""\n\nNow for response format.\n\nFirst, I need to return it in <guess>stein</guess>\n\nBut let\'s confirm the thought process.\n\nThought process summary:\n\nPrevious feedback: C absent, R absent, A absent, N present but wrong position (not position 4), E present but wrong position (not position 5).\n\nThus, secret word contains N and E, no C, no R, no A.\n\nFor next guess, choose a word with N and E in positions other than 4 or 5 respectively, to test new positions.\n\nChose ""STEIN"" with positions: S=1, T=2, E=3, I=4, N=5.\n\nThus, E is at position 3, which is possible, and N at position 5, which is possible.\n\nIntroduces S, T, I.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  \n- C is absent (x) → Secret word has no C.  \n- R is absent (x) → Secret word has no R.  \n- A is absent (x) → Secret word has no A.  \n- N is present but in the wrong position (-) → Secret word contains N, but not at position 4.  \n- E is present but in the wrong position (-) → Secret word contains E, but not at position 5.  \n\nKey deductions:  \n- The secret word includes N and E, but N cannot be at position 4, and E cannot be at position 5.  \n- Excluded letters: C, R, A (cannot be used).  \n- Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, or 5.  \n- Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, or 4.  \n- Goal for this guess: Include N and E in new, untested positions to refine their locations, while introducing new common letters like S, T, or I.  \n\nChose ""STEIN"" because:  \n- It places E at position 3 (a new, untested position).  \n- It places N at position 5 (a new, untested position).  \n- No excluded letters (C, R, A are avoided).  \n- Includes letters S, T, and I, which are common and could provide additional clues.  \n- Avoids repeating known wrong positions for N (position 4) or E (position 5), maximizing information gain.  \n\nThis guess should help determine if E is at position 3 or N is at position 5, while testing other letters for presence and position.\n\n<guess>stein</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
This means:
- C, R, A are absent from the secret word.
- N and E are present but not in position 4 and position 5, respectively.

Guess 2: stein -> S(✓), T(x), E(-), I(-), N(-)
This means:
- S is present and in the correct position (position 1, since S was the first letter).
- T is absent (not in the word).
- E is present but not in position 3 (since E was at position 3 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there).
- I is present but not in position 4.
- N is present but not in position 5.

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. Correctly placed letters:
   - S is in position 1: so the secret word is S _ _ _ _

2. Present letters (but wrong position): E, I, N
   - Additionally, E and N were already known to be present from the first guess.

3. Absent letters: C, R, A, T
   - From guess 1: C, R, A out.
   - From guess 2: T out.

4. Position constraints:
   - E: cannot be in position 3 (from 'stein') and also cannot be in position 5 (from 'crane'). So E must be in position 2 or 4? (since positions: 1=S, 2=?, 3=?, 4=?, 5=?)
     But note: position 1 is taken by S, so E can only be in positions 2,3,4,5. But it's forbidden in 3 and 5, so only possible positions: 2 or 4.
   - I: cannot be in position 4 (from 'stein'), and not placed elsewhere yet. So I can be in position 2,3, or 5? (positions not taken: 2,3,4,5; but I not at 4, so 2,3,5)
   - N: cannot be in position 4 (from 'crane') and cannot be in position 5 (from 'stein'). Also, positions: N cannot be at 4 or 5? Then possible positions: 1,2,3? But position 1 is S, so N can only be in position 2 or 3? Because from 'crane' it was position 4 (forbidden) and from 'stein' it was position 5 (forbidden). So available positions for N: 2 or 3.

Also, note that E, I, N are all present and must be placed in the remaining positions: 2, 3, 4, 5? But position 1 is fixed as S.

So the secret word has structure: S _ _ _ _

And we have three letters to place: E, I, N (since we know E, I, N must be in the word, and we have three spots: 2,3,4,5? No, four positions open but only three letters? Wait, the word is five letters. We know S at 1, and we have E, I, N to place, but they only account for three positions? So there must be one more letter.

We have four positions: 2,3,4,5 to fill. We know that the letters E, I, N are present (all three). So we must have one additional letter that has not been guessed yet? Because we have four positions, and we are placing E, I, N and one other.

From absent letters: we have C, R, A, T absent, so we cannot use these. Also, from present, we have E, I, N, and S fixed at 1.

Now, we also know:

- E must be in position 2 or 4.
- I must be in position 2,3, or 5? But wait, position 5 is available? But N cannot be at position 5? Because in 'stein', N was at 5 and is marked wrong, so N not at 5.

Similarly, N cannot be at position 4? From first guess.

Constraints recap:

- N: not at 4 (from crane) and not at 5 (from stein). Available positions: 2 or 3.
- E: not at 3 (from stein) and not at 5 (from crane). Also, position 1 is taken, so E must be at 2 or 4.
- I: not at position 4 (from stein). Available: 2,3,5.

But note positions 2,3,4,5 need to be filled with:

- E, I, N and one more unknown letter? Since we have four positions and three known letters? Actually, we must have a fifth letter.

Yes: E, I, N are three letters plus S at 1. So there is one more letter to discover? Or could there be a duplicate? But nothing indicates duplicate yet.

We should assume no duplicates for now.

So we have three known present letters: E, I, N and S fixed at position 1. The remaining three positions (2,3,5? Wait positions: 2,3,4,5? Four spots) must contain E, I, N and one new letter.

Since we have E, I, N to place, and one more letter? But four positions: 2,3,4,5. We need to place four letters? But we only know three: E, I, N. Therefore, the fourth letter must be a letter not yet revealed? And absent letters so far: C,R,A,T.

So we need a word that has S at start, E,I,N somewhere, and one more consonant or vowel.

Possible positions:

Assign positions for E, I, N:

- E: can be at 2 or 4
- N: can be at 2 or 3
- I: can be at 2,3,5

But positions 2,3 are potentially overlapping.

Also, if E is at 4, then positions 2 and 3 must be filled by N and I, and then position 5 is the new letter? Or if E is at 2, then position 4 is free? Let's make cases.

Case 1: E at position 2.
Then:
- Position 2: E
- Then N must be at 3 (since N only can be 2 or 3, but 2 taken? So N at 3)
- Then positions left: 4 and 5.
- I: can be at 5? But I can also be at position 3? Contradiction: if E at 2, N at 3, then position 3 is taken by N, so I cannot be at 3? Therefore I can be at 5? Because I cannot be at 4? Because from feedback, I is not at position 4. Wait, I forbidden only at 4? But I can be at 2,3,5. But in this case, position 2 and 3 are taken, so I must be at 5? Then position 4 must be a new letter.

Then word: S E N _ I? But I at position 5? And position 4 is new letter? But then N is at position 3? And E at position 2? And S at 1.

Then we have positions: 1=S,2=E,3=N,4=?,5=I

Is that possible? But check constraints:

- E at position 2: we said E can be at 2? Yes.
- N at position 3: N was forbidden at position 4 and 5, but not at 3? So allowed.
- I at position 5: We said I can be at 5? Yes.

But what about E? We have E at position 2: from 'stein' feedback, E was at position 3 and got '-', meaning not at 3. But here E is at 2, which is fine? Because we don't test position 2 before? Also, in 'crane', E was at position 5 and wrong, but position 2 is different? So possible? However, in this scenario, E at 2: is it forbidden? No, because we only know E not at 3 and not at 5. So position 2 is okay.

Similarly, I at position 5: we don't have constraint against that? Only that I was not at position 4.

And N at position 3? Okay.

But also, the word must have E, I, N and S? And placeholders: S at 1, E at 2, N at 3, so positions 4 and 5: then I at 5? And what at 4? We need a word S E N ? I

Where ? is a letter not used: excluded letters C,R,A,T.

Now, what words? Like ""BEGIN""? But G? Positions: B,E,G,I,N? Wait, S E N ... I? We have 1=S,2=E,3=N,4=X,5=I. Thus ""SENXI""? Not a word. ""PENNI"" but double N? But N would be at 3? Problem: E, N, I placed differently.

Perhaps ""SENIT""? But IT? No English word. Let's think ""SE"" something.

More common: ""SENTI"" meaning of the sent? But senti? Not really English word? Wordle words are English.

Perhaps ""DENIM"" but D? And S not at start.

Case 2: E at position 4.

Then E not at 4? No: E at 4.

Then:
- Position 4: E
- Positions left: 2,3,5.
- N: must be at 2 or 3? Since cannot be 4 or 5.
- I: can be at 2,3,5? But not 4? Which is taken by E? So 2,3,5 available.

Let's assign N: if N at 2, then position 2: N.
Then positions left: 3 and 5.
Then I can be at 3 or 5.
Then new letter for remaining one.

So possibilities:
a) N at 2, I at 3: then position 5 is new. Word: S N I E ? ... positions: S at 1, N at 2, I at 3, E at 4, and ? at 5.
But constraints: I at position 3? In 'stein', I was at position 4? Position 4 of stein was I? And got I(-), meaning I is not at 4. But here I is at position 3? Is that allowed? Yes, because no constraint against position 3 for I? Only not at 4? So position 3 is fine.

b) N at 2, I at 5: then position 3 is new. Word: S N ? E I

c) N at 3, then position 2 and 5 to fill? And position 3=N? Then I: can be at 2 or 5? Because not at 4, but 4 is taken? So positions 2 and 5 available for I.

If N at 3, I at 2? Position 2: I? Then position 5 new: Word: S I N E ?

With positions 1=S,2=I,3=N,4=E,5=?

or N at 3, I at 5: then position 2 new: S ? N E I

Now, let's list possible word structures:

Option A: E at position 2: then we had to have N at 3, I at 5, and a new letter at position 4? So word: S E [new] N I? Wait no: positions: 2=E, 3=N, 4=?, 5=I → word S E N ? I

But last letter I at 5? Then S E N ? I

English words: ""SENNI""? Not a word? ""SENSI""? S not allowed? We have S. ""SENGI""? But G or something? ""SENZY""? Not likely.

Option B: E at position 4.

If E at 4:
  Suboption: N at 2, I at 3: word S N I E [new at 5] → ""SNI E?"" → e.g., SNIPE? But we have P? And positions: S, N, I, E? SNIPE: positions:1=S,2=N,3=I,4=P,5=E? But E at 5? But we have E at position 4? In this suboption, E at position 4? But SNIPE has E at 5? Conflict? No, word should be with E at 4? So ""SNIE?""? Not possible?

Perhaps S, then N at 2, then I at 3, then E at 4, then ? at 5. So ""S N I E ?""

Words like ""SNI E D"" but SNIED? Not a common word. ""SNI E P"" but E P? SNIEP? No. ""SNIEL""? Not English. So not likely? Or regional words? Not good.

  Suboption: N at 2, I at 5: then word: S N ? E I → positions:1=S,2=N,3=?,4=E,5=I → ""SN?EI""

For example, ""SNOWEI""? No, five letters. S ? E I? Possible words: ""SNAEI"" no. ""SNEEI"" double E? Not allowed? E can be repeated? We don't know. But feedback has E at position 5? First.

But E and I: ""SNIEI"" but duplicate I? Not likely. Or ""SUNEI"" U? Possible? U not excluded.

Letters available: any letters except C,R,A,T.

For ""SN?EI"": need a letter for ? such that word exists? Like ""SNOWY"" but E? Wait SNOWY ends with Y, not EI.

Perhaps ""SNEZ E"" or something? No.

Other: ""SONDE"" but O? S O N D E? Positions: S1,O2,N3,D4,E5? But then E at 5? But we have E at position 4? If E is at position 4, we have position 4=E.

In ""SN?EI"", position 4 is E, position 5 is I? So word like ""S? for position 3: so ""SN"" + consonant + ""EI"" ? Like ""SNDEI""? No. ""SNTEI""? T absent. Impossible? Because T is absent? We know T is absent from stein feedback: T(x)? Yes, T is absent.

In stein, T was at position 2 and absent? So T out.

So T cannot be used? So in SN?EI, position 3 cannot be T? And no C,R,A,T.

Possible letters? Let's list available letters.

Available letters for new: any letter except C,R,A,T? And except E,I,N,S which are used? We can reuse? No, because E,I,N,S present, but no duplicates? Assume no duplicates for now.

In ""SN?EI"", E is at 4 and I at 5? But E and I both? Then position ? could be O or something.

Word ""SNEEI"" not English. ""SNOOP"" but no E? We need to include E,I? But they are placed? In this word, position 4=E and 5=I? But for position 3.

Perhaps ""SHINY"" but H? And Y.

There might be no word in this suboption. Look for common words.

Back to suboption with E at 4:
  N at 3 and I at 2: word: S I N E ? → positions:1=S,2=I,3=N,4=E,5=?

This looks promising: ""S I N E ?"" → ""SINE"" something? Like ""SINED""? No. ""SINEW"" W? SINE W? SINEW: meaning tendon? Yes, English word: SINEW = W? Positions: S,I,N,E,W. W at 5? Yes: ""SINEW"" has 1=S,2=I,3=N,4=E,5=W? E at 4? But SINEW has E at 4? Yes, and W at 5.

Constraints check:
- E at position 4: allowed? From E constraints: E can be at 2 or 4? Yes.
- N at position 3: N can be at 2 or 3? Yes. And not at 4 or 5? Correct.
- I at position 2: I can be at 2? Because from 'stein', I was at 4 and got '-', meaning I can be at 2? Yes, since no constraint against position 2.
- S at 1: fixed.
- W: new letter, not excluded? Excluded letters C,R,A,T? W not among, so okay.
- Absent: T is absent? SINEW has no T, good.

Similarly, E at position 4: but in 'crane', E was at position 5 and wrong? Now at 4 is different? Yes.

Another possibility: N at 3 and I at 5? Word: S ? N E I → ""S?NEI"" -> like ""SHINE"" H? Position 2=H? Then ""SHINE"" positions: S,H,I,N,E? But E at 5? But we are considering E at position 4? In ""S?NEI"", position 4=E and 5=I? So ""S? N E I"" meaning position 2=?, 3=N,4=E,5=I. So ""S_NEI"" -> like ""SKNEI"" not word? ""SPNEI"" not word? ""SABEI"" A out? ""SUDEI"" U? Not common? Not good.

So the most likely word structure so far is option: E at 4, N at 3, I at 2: giving ""S I N E ?"" like ""SINEW"" with W? So secret word could be ""SINEW"".

But we have another case: E at 4, N at 3, I at 5: which is ""S ? N E I""? but we couldn't find a word? So perhaps ""SHONE"" H O N E? S H O N E? But O? Positions: S1,H2,O3,N4,E5? But N at position 4? Forbidden! Because N cannot be at position 4? Conflict.

Thus, ""SHINE"" cannot be with E at 4? SHINE has positions: S1,H2,I3,N4,E5? This? N at 4? Forbidden, because N cannot be at position 4. So invalid.

Back to ""SINEW"": with positions 1=S,2=I,3=N,4=E,5=W? Possible.

Are there other candidates? E at 4, N at 2, I at 5: ""S N ? E I"" → ""SN?EI"" → hardly exists.

E at 4, N at 2, I at 3: ""S N I E X"" → ""SNI E X"" → no word? ""SNIEG""? No.

So ""SINEW"" seems a candidate.

But let's confirm with the I constraint: in ""SINEW"", I is at position 2? But in the feedback from stein, I was at position 4 and got I(-), meaning I is in the word but not at position 4. That doesn't say anything about position 2? So it can be at 2? Yes.

Similarly no issue.

Therefore, I think ""SINEW"" is possible.

But we are not sure, because there might be other possibilities? For example, if E is at position 2.

Earlier with E at 2: then we had to have ""S E N ? I"" → word? ""SENGI""? Not English. ""SENVI""? Not. So unlikely.

With E at 4: other combination? Or what about I at position 3? For example, E at 4, N at 2, I at 3: ""SNIE_"" → ""SNIEG""? No.

So ""SINEW"" is a strong candidate? But let's see if there are other words.

Perhaps: E at position 4, N at 3, and I at 5? Then word ""S?NEI"" with position 2 unknown? Must be a letter. But ""SHINE""? But ""SHINE"" has E at 5, not at 4? Conflict? Because we fixed E at 4? So ""S?N E I"" position 2: ?, position 3=N,4=E,5=I → so ""S?NEI"" -> ""SPINE"" P? But then E would be at 5? Positions: S P I N E? S1,P2,I3,N4,E5? But N at position 4? Forbidden! Because N not at 4? And E at 5? Also forbidden? This word has N at position 4 and E at 5? Both constraints violated? Impossible.

So only feasible is E at 4, N at 3, I at 2: ""SINEW""?

But is ""SINEW"" the only word? How about ""SIDEE"" double E? Not good? We don't know.

Another word: ""SILEP""? No? Or ""SINES"" with S duplicate? But feedback doesn't show duplicate, but possible? But first letter S, so duplicate.

In this case, ""SINES""? Positions: S,I,N,E,S? But 5=S? But S is already at position 1? And S at position 5? Possible? Then positions 1=S(✓),2=I,3=N,4=E,5=S? But E at position 4? And I at 2? N at 3?

Check constraints: E at 4? Allowed? Yes. N at 3? Yes. S at 1? Fixed. S at 5? But is S duplicated? In the feedback for first guess, S was not tested? In 'crane', no S. In 'stein', S at 1 correct? And in 'stein' feedback, other letters? T absent? E present but not at position 3? Etc.

But in ""SINES"", S is at positions 1 and 5? And E at position 4.

How we know about duplicates? We don't? But in feedback, for position 5 of ""ste in"" we guessed N and got N(-), meaning N present but not at 5? And secret word has N? If it has two N's? But in this case, in ""SINES"", N at position 3? Only one N? Satisfies.

But duplicate S? Possible? Wordle allows?

But let's be cautious? If we guess ""SINEW"", we can test.

However, there's another point: in guess 2, we have S at 1 correct? So if we guess ""SINEW"", it has S at 1, which matches.

For this guess, we can guess ""SINEW"" to test.

But we need to guess a word? And we have more constraints.

Since the secret word must have I? And we haven't guessed any other positions? But we need a word that uses the letters.

Perhaps there's ""SHIELD"" but too many letters? No.

Another word: with different letter placement.

Forget the cases, let's think from available positions.

Since position 1=S fixed? Now, we have E: must be in position 2 or 4? And N must be in position 2 or 3? And I must be in position 2,3,5? But positions:2,3,4,5 to fill.

Also, letter not known yet.

Now, let's list possible words that fit:

- Start with S
- Contain E, I, N
- No C,R,A,T
- E not at 3 or 5, so at 2 or 4
- N not at 4 or 5, so at 2 or 3
- I not at 4? Only constraint not at 4? Can be other places? Actually, I can be anywhere except 4? So 2,3,5.

Possible words:

""SI? E N"" but positions? Define.

If E at 2: then positions: S E _ _ _
With N at 3: as required? Since N must be at 2 or 3? And position 2 taken, so N at 3? Then _ at position 4, and I at 5? Because I must be placed? So: S E N ? I

Word like ""SENSI""? S duplicate? Position 4=S? ""SENSE"" but S and E duplicate? ""SENSE"": positions: S1,E2,N3,S4,E5? E2 and E5? Duplicate? Possible? And S twice? But constraints: E not at 5? Forbidden! Because E cannot be at position 5? from crane feedback? If ""SENSE"" has E at position 5? E at 5 forbidden? So impossible? Because E must not be at 5? So ""SENSE"" invalid.

Other words? No good.

Then E at 4: positions? S _ _ E _

I: that's position 4=E taken? So I can be at 2,3,5.

N: must be at 2 or 3.

So cases:

Case a: N at 2: then S N _ E _
Then position 3 and 5: one for I and one for new? But letter? Positions: S N ? E ?
With ?3 and ?5: one must be I? So either I at 3 or I at 5.

If I at 3: S N I E ? → ""SNIE?"" → e.g., ""SNI E D"" → SNIED? Not English? Perhaps? But rare? ""SNI E P"" SNIEP no.

If I at 5: S N ? E I → e.g., ""SNAEI"" no? ""SNEEI"" no? ""SNOWY"" but E? Not.

Case b: N at 3: then S ? N E _
Then position 2? Position 5: must contain I and another? Positions: S at 1, position 2=?, position 3=N, position 4=E, position 5=?

Now, I must be somewhere: if I at position 2 or 5? If I at position 2: S I N E ? → ""SINE?"" with last letter? If ? is a letter like ""SINEW"" or ""SINED"" no? ""SINE S"" but S duplicate and E duplicate? But E at 4: fine? With ?=S: ""SINES"" -> meaning of sine? Plural? Sine is math term? Wordle accepts? But positions: S1, I2, N3, E4, S5. S duplicated? Possible? And E at 4, fine? I at 2: fine? But E is used at position 4? No duplicate E? Only one E.

If I at position 5: S ? N E I → ""SNEI"" something? With position 2: ""SNE I"" + position 2 letter? ""S_UNEI""? Like ""SUN"" but need EI? Not.

So possible words so far: ""SINEW"" (W at 5) or ""SINES"" (S duplicate? Position 5=S? Also, S is at position 1).

Are there other? Like ""SILEN"" T? T out? ""SIDER"" R out? Or ""SIDHE"" D H E? Not common.

But ""SINEW"" is an English word meaning a tendon? Yes.

""SINES"" might be accepted? But let's see the official Wordle list? We don't have it? But we have to assume possibilities.

Perhaps ""SPIEL"" but P L? But if E at 4, position 4=E? ""SPIEL"" positions: S1,P2,I3,E4,L5? E at 4? L5? But I not placed? We have I at position 3? Good? And E at 4? Good? Then ""SPIEL"" has letters: S,P,I,E,L? But N missing? Must have N? Because N is present? In ""SPIEL"", no N? But feedback shows N is in the word? ""stein"" had N and got ""-"" meaning present? So secret word must contain N? Therefore ""SPIEL"" has no N? Invalid.

Similarly, all words must include E,I,N? And S.

Now, back to guessing: since ""SINEW"" is possible, and we have to make a guess, let's guess ""SINEW"" next? But we are at guess 3? We can guess a word that covers other possibilities? For example, position 2 could be I or something else? We think it is I.

But in ""SINES"", position 2=I, but position 5=S? S duplicate? Possible? But let's check if S can be duplicated? We don't know? But in first guess, all unique? Second guess all unique? But secret word could have duplicates.

However, for efficiency, we can guess a word that uses a different letter for position 2? If possible.

Another word: ""SHIRE"" R out? Not.

Perhaps ""SKIED"" K,D? Positions: S,K,I,E,D? E at 4? Position 4=E? But in ""SKIED"": S K I E D, so E at position 4? Then N missing? Must have N? So invalid.

So ""SINEW"" is good candidate.

But let's see if there is another with N in different position.

Suppose E at position 2? But we seen it is difficult? And we have ""SEN??"" with I at 5? But no common word.

So likely secret word is ""SINEW""?

Therefore, for this guess, we can guess ""SINEW"" to test.

If not, we may get feedback.

So I will guess ""SINEW""?
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  
  This indicates:  
  - C, R, A are absent from the secret word.  
  - N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5, respectively.  

- **Guess 2: STEIN** → S(✓), T(x), E(-), I(-), N(-)  
  This indicates:  
  - S is in position 1 and correctly placed.  
  - T is absent.  
  - E is present but not in position 3.  
  - I is present but not in position 4.  
  - N is present but not in position 5.  

### Step-by-Step Deduction:
1. **Fixed Position**:  
   - S(✓) at position 1 means the secret word starts with S. So the word pattern is: S _ _ _ _  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
- From CRANE: C, R, A are absent.  
- From STEIN: T is absent.  
- Full list of excluded letters: C, R, A, T. Cannot be used in guesses.  

3. **Present Letters**:  
- E is present (from both guesses) but with constraints:  
  - Not at position 3 (from STEIN).  
  - Not at position 5 (from CRANE).  
  - Possible positions: 2 or 4.  
- I is present (from STEIN) but not at position 4. Possible positions: 2, 3, or 5.  
- N is present (from both guesses) but with constraints:  
  - Not at position 4 (from CRANE).  
  - Not at position 5 (from STEIN).  
  - Possible positions: 2 or 3.  

4. **Constraints Summary**:  
- Positions 2, 3, 4, 5 must be filled with E, I, N, and one unknown letter (since only 3 known present letters: E, I, N, but 4 slots; a new letter must exist).  
- Secret word pattern: S _ _ _ _  
- E can only be at position 2 or 4.  
- N can only be at position 2 or 3.  
- I can be at position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).  
- Due to overlaps:  
  - If E is at position 2, then N must be at position 3 (since position 2 is taken, and N cannot be at 4/5). Then I must be at position 5 (since position 3 is taken by N, and I cannot be at 4), leaving position 4 for a new letter. Word example: S E N ? I (no common English word fits; e.g., ""SENPI"" invalid).  
  - If E is at position 4, N can be at position 2 or 3:  
    - If N at position 2, I can be at position 3 or 5.  
      - I at position 3: S N I E ? (e.g., ""SNIE?""; rare words like ""SNIED"" not ideal).  
      - I at position 5: S N ? E I (e.g., ""SN?EI""; no common word).  
    - If N at position 3, I can be at position 2 or 5.  
      - I at position 2: S I N E ? (e.g., ""SINE?""; only ""SINEW"" fits with ""W"", common English word meaning a tendon).  
      - I at position 5: S ? N E I (e.g., ""SHINE"" invalid due to E at 5; ""SPINE"" invalid due to N at 4).  

5. **Recommended Guess**:  
- ""SINEW"" is the strongest candidate:  
  - S (position 1, fixed), I (position 2, satisfies constraints), N (position 3, satisfies constraints), E (position 4, satisfies constraints), W (new letter, not excluded).  
- ""SINEW"" confirms all constraints:  
  - E at position 4 is allowed (not position 3 or 5).  
  - N at position 3 is allowed (not position 4 or 5).  
  - I at position 2 is allowed (not position 4).  
  - W is not excluded (C, R, A, T absent).  
- If ""SINEW"" is incorrect, feedback will help refine further. Other possibilities like ""SINES"" exist but are less likely (e.g., potential S duplication).

<guess>sinew</guess>",sinew,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
This means:
- C, R, A are absent from the secret word.
- N and E are present but not in position 4 and position 5, respectively.

Guess 2: stein -> S(✓), T(x), E(-), I(-), N(-)
This means:
- S is present and in the correct position (position 1, since S was the first letter).
- T is absent (not in the word).
- E is present but not in position 3 (since E was at position 3 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there).
- I is present but not in position 4.
- N is present but not in position 5.

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. Correctly placed letters:
   - S is in position 1: so the secret word is S _ _ _ _

2. Present letters (but wrong position): E, I, N
   - Additionally, E and N were already known to be present from the first guess.

3. Absent letters: C, R, A, T
   - From guess 1: C, R, A out.
   - From guess 2: T out.

4. Position constraints:
   - E: cannot be in position 3 (from 'stein') and also cannot be in position 5 (from 'crane'). So E must be in position 2 or 4? (since positions: 1=S, 2=?, 3=?, 4=?, 5=?)
     But note: position 1 is taken by S, so E can only be in positions 2,3,4,5. But it's forbidden in 3 and 5, so only possible positions: 2 or 4.
   - I: cannot be in position 4 (from 'stein'), and not placed elsewhere yet. So I can be in position 2,3, or 5? (positions not taken: 2,3,4,5; but I not at 4, so 2,3,5)
   - N: cannot be in position 4 (from 'crane') and cannot be in position 5 (from 'stein'). Also, positions: N cannot be at 4 or 5? Then possible positions: 1,2,3? But position 1 is S, so N can only be in position 2 or 3? Because from 'crane' it was position 4 (forbidden) and from 'stein' it was position 5 (forbidden). So available positions for N: 2 or 3.

Also, note that E, I, N are all present and must be placed in the remaining positions: 2, 3, 4, 5? But position 1 is fixed as S.

So the secret word has structure: S _ _ _ _

And we have three letters to place: E, I, N (since we know E, I, N must be in the word, and we have three spots: 2,3,4,5? No, four positions open but only three letters? Wait, the word is five letters. We know S at 1, and we have E, I, N to place, but they only account for three positions? So there must be one more letter.

We have four positions: 2,3,4,5 to fill. We know that the letters E, I, N are present (all three). So we must have one additional letter that has not been guessed yet? Because we have four positions, and we are placing E, I, N and one other.

From absent letters: we have C, R, A, T absent, so we cannot use these. Also, from present, we have E, I, N, and S fixed at 1.

Now, we also know:

- E must be in position 2 or 4.
- I must be in position 2,3, or 5? But wait, position 5 is available? But N cannot be at position 5? Because in 'stein', N was at 5 and is marked wrong, so N not at 5.

Similarly, N cannot be at position 4? From first guess.

Constraints recap:

- N: not at 4 (from crane) and not at 5 (from stein). Available positions: 2 or 3.
- E: not at 3 (from stein) and not at 5 (from crane). Also, position 1 is taken, so E must be at 2 or 4.
- I: not at position 4 (from stein). Available: 2,3,5.

But note positions 2,3,4,5 need to be filled with:

- E, I, N and one more unknown letter? Since we have four positions and three known letters? Actually, we must have a fifth letter.

Yes: E, I, N are three letters plus S at 1. So there is one more letter to discover? Or could there be a duplicate? But nothing indicates duplicate yet.

We should assume no duplicates for now.

So we have three known present letters: E, I, N and S fixed at position 1. The remaining three positions (2,3,5? Wait positions: 2,3,4,5? Four spots) must contain E, I, N and one new letter.

Since we have E, I, N to place, and one more letter? But four positions: 2,3,4,5. We need to place four letters? But we only know three: E, I, N. Therefore, the fourth letter must be a letter not yet revealed? And absent letters so far: C,R,A,T.

So we need a word that has S at start, E,I,N somewhere, and one more consonant or vowel.

Possible positions:

Assign positions for E, I, N:

- E: can be at 2 or 4
- N: can be at 2 or 3
- I: can be at 2,3,5

But positions 2,3 are potentially overlapping.

Also, if E is at 4, then positions 2 and 3 must be filled by N and I, and then position 5 is the new letter? Or if E is at 2, then position 4 is free? Let's make cases.

Case 1: E at position 2.
Then:
- Position 2: E
- Then N must be at 3 (since N only can be 2 or 3, but 2 taken? So N at 3)
- Then positions left: 4 and 5.
- I: can be at 5? But I can also be at position 3? Contradiction: if E at 2, N at 3, then position 3 is taken by N, so I cannot be at 3? Therefore I can be at 5? Because I cannot be at 4? Because from feedback, I is not at position 4. Wait, I forbidden only at 4? But I can be at 2,3,5. But in this case, position 2 and 3 are taken, so I must be at 5? Then position 4 must be a new letter.

Then word: S E N _ I? But I at position 5? And position 4 is new letter? But then N is at position 3? And E at position 2? And S at 1.

Then we have positions: 1=S,2=E,3=N,4=?,5=I

Is that possible? But check constraints:

- E at position 2: we said E can be at 2? Yes.
- N at position 3: N was forbidden at position 4 and 5, but not at 3? So allowed.
- I at position 5: We said I can be at 5? Yes.

But what about E? We have E at position 2: from 'stein' feedback, E was at position 3 and got '-', meaning not at 3. But here E is at 2, which is fine? Because we don't test position 2 before? Also, in 'crane', E was at position 5 and wrong, but position 2 is different? So possible? However, in this scenario, E at 2: is it forbidden? No, because we only know E not at 3 and not at 5. So position 2 is okay.

Similarly, I at position 5: we don't have constraint against that? Only that I was not at position 4.

And N at position 3? Okay.

But also, the word must have E, I, N and S? And placeholders: S at 1, E at 2, N at 3, so positions 4 and 5: then I at 5? And what at 4? We need a word S E N ? I

Where ? is a letter not used: excluded letters C,R,A,T.

Now, what words? Like ""BEGIN""? But G? Positions: B,E,G,I,N? Wait, S E N ... I? We have 1=S,2=E,3=N,4=X,5=I. Thus ""SENXI""? Not a word. ""PENNI"" but double N? But N would be at 3? Problem: E, N, I placed differently.

Perhaps ""SENIT""? But IT? No English word. Let's think ""SE"" something.

More common: ""SENTI"" meaning of the sent? But senti? Not really English word? Wordle words are English.

Perhaps ""DENIM"" but D? And S not at start.

Case 2: E at position 4.

Then E not at 4? No: E at 4.

Then:
- Position 4: E
- Positions left: 2,3,5.
- N: must be at 2 or 3? Since cannot be 4 or 5.
- I: can be at 2,3,5? But not 4? Which is taken by E? So 2,3,5 available.

Let's assign N: if N at 2, then position 2: N.
Then positions left: 3 and 5.
Then I can be at 3 or 5.
Then new letter for remaining one.

So possibilities:
a) N at 2, I at 3: then position 5 is new. Word: S N I E ? ... positions: S at 1, N at 2, I at 3, E at 4, and ? at 5.
But constraints: I at position 3? In 'stein', I was at position 4? Position 4 of stein was I? And got I(-), meaning I is not at 4. But here I is at position 3? Is that allowed? Yes, because no constraint against position 3 for I? Only not at 4? So position 3 is fine.

b) N at 2, I at 5: then position 3 is new. Word: S N ? E I

c) N at 3, then position 2 and 5 to fill? And position 3=N? Then I: can be at 2 or 5? Because not at 4, but 4 is taken? So positions 2 and 5 available for I.

If N at 3, I at 2? Position 2: I? Then position 5 new: Word: S I N E ?

With positions 1=S,2=I,3=N,4=E,5=?

or N at 3, I at 5: then position 2 new: S ? N E I

Now, let's list possible word structures:

Option A: E at position 2: then we had to have N at 3, I at 5, and a new letter at position 4? So word: S E [new] N I? Wait no: positions: 2=E, 3=N, 4=?, 5=I → word S E N ? I

But last letter I at 5? Then S E N ? I

English words: ""SENNI""? Not a word? ""SENSI""? S not allowed? We have S. ""SENGI""? But G or something? ""SENZY""? Not likely.

Option B: E at position 4.

If E at 4:
  Suboption: N at 2, I at 3: word S N I E [new at 5] → ""SNI E?"" → e.g., SNIPE? But we have P? And positions: S, N, I, E? SNIPE: positions:1=S,2=N,3=I,4=P,5=E? But E at 5? But we have E at position 4? In this suboption, E at position 4? But SNIPE has E at 5? Conflict? No, word should be with E at 4? So ""SNIE?""? Not possible?

Perhaps S, then N at 2, then I at 3, then E at 4, then ? at 5. So ""S N I E ?""

Words like ""SNI E D"" but SNIED? Not a common word. ""SNI E P"" but E P? SNIEP? No. ""SNIEL""? Not English. So not likely? Or regional words? Not good.

  Suboption: N at 2, I at 5: then word: S N ? E I → positions:1=S,2=N,3=?,4=E,5=I → ""SN?EI""

For example, ""SNOWEI""? No, five letters. S ? E I? Possible words: ""SNAEI"" no. ""SNEEI"" double E? Not allowed? E can be repeated? We don't know. But feedback has E at position 5? First.

But E and I: ""SNIEI"" but duplicate I? Not likely. Or ""SUNEI"" U? Possible? U not excluded.

Letters available: any letters except C,R,A,T.

For ""SN?EI"": need a letter for ? such that word exists? Like ""SNOWY"" but E? Wait SNOWY ends with Y, not EI.

Perhaps ""SNEZ E"" or something? No.

Other: ""SONDE"" but O? S O N D E? Positions: S1,O2,N3,D4,E5? But then E at 5? But we have E at position 4? If E is at position 4, we have position 4=E.

In ""SN?EI"", position 4 is E, position 5 is I? So word like ""S? for position 3: so ""SN"" + consonant + ""EI"" ? Like ""SNDEI""? No. ""SNTEI""? T absent. Impossible? Because T is absent? We know T is absent from stein feedback: T(x)? Yes, T is absent.

In stein, T was at position 2 and absent? So T out.

So T cannot be used? So in SN?EI, position 3 cannot be T? And no C,R,A,T.

Possible letters? Let's list available letters.

Available letters for new: any letter except C,R,A,T? And except E,I,N,S which are used? We can reuse? No, because E,I,N,S present, but no duplicates? Assume no duplicates for now.

In ""SN?EI"", E is at 4 and I at 5? But E and I both? Then position ? could be O or something.

Word ""SNEEI"" not English. ""SNOOP"" but no E? We need to include E,I? But they are placed? In this word, position 4=E and 5=I? But for position 3.

Perhaps ""SHINY"" but H? And Y.

There might be no word in this suboption. Look for common words.

Back to suboption with E at 4:
  N at 3 and I at 2: word: S I N E ? → positions:1=S,2=I,3=N,4=E,5=?

This looks promising: ""S I N E ?"" → ""SINE"" something? Like ""SINED""? No. ""SINEW"" W? SINE W? SINEW: meaning tendon? Yes, English word: SINEW = W? Positions: S,I,N,E,W. W at 5? Yes: ""SINEW"" has 1=S,2=I,3=N,4=E,5=W? E at 4? But SINEW has E at 4? Yes, and W at 5.

Constraints check:
- E at position 4: allowed? From E constraints: E can be at 2 or 4? Yes.
- N at position 3: N can be at 2 or 3? Yes. And not at 4 or 5? Correct.
- I at position 2: I can be at 2? Because from 'stein', I was at 4 and got '-', meaning I can be at 2? Yes, since no constraint against position 2.
- S at 1: fixed.
- W: new letter, not excluded? Excluded letters C,R,A,T? W not among, so okay.
- Absent: T is absent? SINEW has no T, good.

Similarly, E at position 4: but in 'crane', E was at position 5 and wrong? Now at 4 is different? Yes.

Another possibility: N at 3 and I at 5? Word: S ? N E I → ""S?NEI"" -> like ""SHINE"" H? Position 2=H? Then ""SHINE"" positions: S,H,I,N,E? But E at 5? But we are considering E at position 4? In ""S?NEI"", position 4=E and 5=I? So ""S? N E I"" meaning position 2=?, 3=N,4=E,5=I. So ""S_NEI"" -> like ""SKNEI"" not word? ""SPNEI"" not word? ""SABEI"" A out? ""SUDEI"" U? Not common? Not good.

So the most likely word structure so far is option: E at 4, N at 3, I at 2: giving ""S I N E ?"" like ""SINEW"" with W? So secret word could be ""SINEW"".

But we have another case: E at 4, N at 3, I at 5: which is ""S ? N E I""? but we couldn't find a word? So perhaps ""SHONE"" H O N E? S H O N E? But O? Positions: S1,H2,O3,N4,E5? But N at position 4? Forbidden! Because N cannot be at position 4? Conflict.

Thus, ""SHINE"" cannot be with E at 4? SHINE has positions: S1,H2,I3,N4,E5? This? N at 4? Forbidden, because N cannot be at position 4. So invalid.

Back to ""SINEW"": with positions 1=S,2=I,3=N,4=E,5=W? Possible.

Are there other candidates? E at 4, N at 2, I at 5: ""S N ? E I"" → ""SN?EI"" → hardly exists.

E at 4, N at 2, I at 3: ""S N I E X"" → ""SNI E X"" → no word? ""SNIEG""? No.

So ""SINEW"" seems a candidate.

But let's confirm with the I constraint: in ""SINEW"", I is at position 2? But in the feedback from stein, I was at position 4 and got I(-), meaning I is in the word but not at position 4. That doesn't say anything about position 2? So it can be at 2? Yes.

Similarly no issue.

Therefore, I think ""SINEW"" is possible.

But we are not sure, because there might be other possibilities? For example, if E is at position 2.

Earlier with E at 2: then we had to have ""S E N ? I"" → word? ""SENGI""? Not English. ""SENVI""? Not. So unlikely.

With E at 4: other combination? Or what about I at position 3? For example, E at 4, N at 2, I at 3: ""SNIE_"" → ""SNIEG""? No.

So ""SINEW"" is a strong candidate? But let's see if there are other words.

Perhaps: E at position 4, N at 3, and I at 5? Then word ""S?NEI"" with position 2 unknown? Must be a letter. But ""SHINE""? But ""SHINE"" has E at 5, not at 4? Conflict? Because we fixed E at 4? So ""S?N E I"" position 2: ?, position 3=N,4=E,5=I → so ""S?NEI"" -> ""SPINE"" P? But then E would be at 5? Positions: S P I N E? S1,P2,I3,N4,E5? But N at position 4? Forbidden! Because N not at 4? And E at 5? Also forbidden? This word has N at position 4 and E at 5? Both constraints violated? Impossible.

So only feasible is E at 4, N at 3, I at 2: ""SINEW""?

But is ""SINEW"" the only word? How about ""SIDEE"" double E? Not good? We don't know.

Another word: ""SILEP""? No? Or ""SINES"" with S duplicate? But feedback doesn't show duplicate, but possible? But first letter S, so duplicate.

In this case, ""SINES""? Positions: S,I,N,E,S? But 5=S? But S is already at position 1? And S at position 5? Possible? Then positions 1=S(✓),2=I,3=N,4=E,5=S? But E at position 4? And I at 2? N at 3?

Check constraints: E at 4? Allowed? Yes. N at 3? Yes. S at 1? Fixed. S at 5? But is S duplicated? In the feedback for first guess, S was not tested? In 'crane', no S. In 'stein', S at 1 correct? And in 'stein' feedback, other letters? T absent? E present but not at position 3? Etc.

But in ""SINES"", S is at positions 1 and 5? And E at position 4.

How we know about duplicates? We don't? But in feedback, for position 5 of ""ste in"" we guessed N and got N(-), meaning N present but not at 5? And secret word has N? If it has two N's? But in this case, in ""SINES"", N at position 3? Only one N? Satisfies.

But duplicate S? Possible? Wordle allows?

But let's be cautious? If we guess ""SINEW"", we can test.

However, there's another point: in guess 2, we have S at 1 correct? So if we guess ""SINEW"", it has S at 1, which matches.

For this guess, we can guess ""SINEW"" to test.

But we need to guess a word? And we have more constraints.

Since the secret word must have I? And we haven't guessed any other positions? But we need a word that uses the letters.

Perhaps there's ""SHIELD"" but too many letters? No.

Another word: with different letter placement.

Forget the cases, let's think from available positions.

Since position 1=S fixed? Now, we have E: must be in position 2 or 4? And N must be in position 2 or 3? And I must be in position 2,3,5? But positions:2,3,4,5 to fill.

Also, letter not known yet.

Now, let's list possible words that fit:

- Start with S
- Contain E, I, N
- No C,R,A,T
- E not at 3 or 5, so at 2 or 4
- N not at 4 or 5, so at 2 or 3
- I not at 4? Only constraint not at 4? Can be other places? Actually, I can be anywhere except 4? So 2,3,5.

Possible words:

""SI? E N"" but positions? Define.

If E at 2: then positions: S E _ _ _
With N at 3: as required? Since N must be at 2 or 3? And position 2 taken, so N at 3? Then _ at position 4, and I at 5? Because I must be placed? So: S E N ? I

Word like ""SENSI""? S duplicate? Position 4=S? ""SENSE"" but S and E duplicate? ""SENSE"": positions: S1,E2,N3,S4,E5? E2 and E5? Duplicate? Possible? And S twice? But constraints: E not at 5? Forbidden! Because E cannot be at position 5? from crane feedback? If ""SENSE"" has E at position 5? E at 5 forbidden? So impossible? Because E must not be at 5? So ""SENSE"" invalid.

Other words? No good.

Then E at 4: positions? S _ _ E _

I: that's position 4=E taken? So I can be at 2,3,5.

N: must be at 2 or 3.

So cases:

Case a: N at 2: then S N _ E _
Then position 3 and 5: one for I and one for new? But letter? Positions: S N ? E ?
With ?3 and ?5: one must be I? So either I at 3 or I at 5.

If I at 3: S N I E ? → ""SNIE?"" → e.g., ""SNI E D"" → SNIED? Not English? Perhaps? But rare? ""SNI E P"" SNIEP no.

If I at 5: S N ? E I → e.g., ""SNAEI"" no? ""SNEEI"" no? ""SNOWY"" but E? Not.

Case b: N at 3: then S ? N E _
Then position 2? Position 5: must contain I and another? Positions: S at 1, position 2=?, position 3=N, position 4=E, position 5=?

Now, I must be somewhere: if I at position 2 or 5? If I at position 2: S I N E ? → ""SINE?"" with last letter? If ? is a letter like ""SINEW"" or ""SINED"" no? ""SINE S"" but S duplicate and E duplicate? But E at 4: fine? With ?=S: ""SINES"" -> meaning of sine? Plural? Sine is math term? Wordle accepts? But positions: S1, I2, N3, E4, S5. S duplicated? Possible? And E at 4, fine? I at 2: fine? But E is used at position 4? No duplicate E? Only one E.

If I at position 5: S ? N E I → ""SNEI"" something? With position 2: ""SNE I"" + position 2 letter? ""S_UNEI""? Like ""SUN"" but need EI? Not.

So possible words so far: ""SINEW"" (W at 5) or ""SINES"" (S duplicate? Position 5=S? Also, S is at position 1).

Are there other? Like ""SILEN"" T? T out? ""SIDER"" R out? Or ""SIDHE"" D H E? Not common.

But ""SINEW"" is an English word meaning a tendon? Yes.

""SINES"" might be accepted? But let's see the official Wordle list? We don't have it? But we have to assume possibilities.

Perhaps ""SPIEL"" but P L? But if E at 4, position 4=E? ""SPIEL"" positions: S1,P2,I3,E4,L5? E at 4? L5? But I not placed? We have I at position 3? Good? And E at 4? Good? Then ""SPIEL"" has letters: S,P,I,E,L? But N missing? Must have N? Because N is present? In ""SPIEL"", no N? But feedback shows N is in the word? ""stein"" had N and got ""-"" meaning present? So secret word must contain N? Therefore ""SPIEL"" has no N? Invalid.

Similarly, all words must include E,I,N? And S.

Now, back to guessing: since ""SINEW"" is possible, and we have to make a guess, let's guess ""SINEW"" next? But we are at guess 3? We can guess a word that covers other possibilities? For example, position 2 could be I or something else? We think it is I.

But in ""SINES"", position 2=I, but position 5=S? S duplicate? Possible? But let's check if S can be duplicated? We don't know? But in first guess, all unique? Second guess all unique? But secret word could have duplicates.

However, for efficiency, we can guess a word that uses a different letter for position 2? If possible.

Another word: ""SHIRE"" R out? Not.

Perhaps ""SKIED"" K,D? Positions: S,K,I,E,D? E at 4? Position 4=E? But in ""SKIED"": S K I E D, so E at position 4? Then N missing? Must have N? So invalid.

So ""SINEW"" is good candidate.

But let's see if there is another with N in different position.

Suppose E at position 2? But we seen it is difficult? And we have ""SEN??"" with I at 5? But no common word.

So likely secret word is ""SINEW""?

Therefore, for this guess, we can guess ""SINEW"" to test.

If not, we may get feedback.

So I will guess ""SINEW""?Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  
  This indicates:  
  - C, R, A are absent from the secret word.  
  - N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5, respectively.  

- **Guess 2: STEIN** → S(✓), T(x), E(-), I(-), N(-)  
  This indicates:  
  - S is in position 1 and correctly placed.  
  - T is absent.  
  - E is present but not in position 3.  
  - I is present but not in position 4.  
  - N is present but not in position 5.  

### Step-by-Step Deduction:
1. **Fixed Position**:  
   - S(✓) at position 1 means the secret word starts with S. So the word pattern is: S _ _ _ _  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
- From CRANE: C, R, A are absent.  
- From STEIN: T is absent.  
- Full list of excluded letters: C, R, A, T. Cannot be used in guesses.  

3. **Present Letters**:  
- E is present (from both guesses) but with constraints:  
  - Not at position 3 (from STEIN).  
  - Not at position 5 (from CRANE).  
  - Possible positions: 2 or 4.  
- I is present (from STEIN) but not at position 4. Possible positions: 2, 3, or 5.  
- N is present (from both guesses) but with constraints:  
  - Not at position 4 (from CRANE).  
  - Not at position 5 (from STEIN).  
  - Possible positions: 2 or 3.  

4. **Constraints Summary**:  
- Positions 2, 3, 4, 5 must be filled with E, I, N, and one unknown letter (since only 3 known present letters: E, I, N, but 4 slots; a new letter must exist).  
- Secret word pattern: S _ _ _ _  
- E can only be at position 2 or 4.  
- N can only be at position 2 or 3.  
- I can be at position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).  
- Due to overlaps:  
  - If E is at position 2, then N must be at position 3 (since position 2 is taken, and N cannot be at 4/5). Then I must be at position 5 (since position 3 is taken by N, and I cannot be at 4), leaving position 4 for a new letter. Word example: S E N ? I (no common English word fits; e.g., ""SENPI"" invalid).  
  - If E is at position 4, N can be at position 2 or 3:  
    - If N at position 2, I can be at position 3 or 5.  
      - I at position 3: S N I E ? (e.g., ""SNIE?""; rare words like ""SNIED"" not ideal).  
      - I at position 5: S N ? E I (e.g., ""SN?EI""; no common word).  
    - If N at position 3, I can be at position 2 or 5.  
      - I at position 2: S I N E ? (e.g., ""SINE?""; only ""SINEW"" fits with ""W"", common English word meaning a tendon).  
      - I at position 5: S ? N E I (e.g., ""SHINE"" invalid due to E at 5; ""SPINE"" invalid due to N at 4).  

5. **Recommended Guess**:  
- ""SINEW"" is the strongest candidate:  
  - S (position 1, fixed), I (position 2, satisfies constraints), N (position 3, satisfies constraints), E (position 4, satisfies constraints), W (new letter, not excluded).  
- ""SINEW"" confirms all constraints:  
  - E at position 4 is allowed (not position 3 or 5).  
  - N at position 3 is allowed (not position 4 or 5).  
  - I at position 2 is allowed (not position 4).  
  - W is not excluded (C, R, A, T absent).  
- If ""SINEW"" is incorrect, feedback will help refine further. Other possibilities like ""SINES"" exist but are less likely (e.g., potential S duplication).",Guess 3: sinew -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(✓) N(✓) E(✓) W(✓),SUCCESS
