We are making the first guess. Without any prior information, a good starting word is one that includes common letters and has a balanced letter distribution.
 Common starting words in Wordle often contain multiple vowels and common consonants. Examples: ""CRATE"", ""ROATE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ARISE"", etc.
 I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains A, R, I, S, E which are common letters.

For the first guess, I chose ""ARISE"" because it includes common vowels (A, I, E) and frequent consonants (R, S), maximizing the chance to uncover overlaps with the secret word. This provides a solid baseline for deducing the word structure.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""arise"":
- A: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since we placed it in the second position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains R (but not in position 2) and does not contain A, I, S, or E.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain A, I, S, E (since they are not in the word).
- Must contain R (and we know it's not in position 2, so we should place R in a different position: 1, 3, 4, or 5).

Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and covering different positions.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We should avoid using any of the discarded letters: A, I, S, E.

Let's think of words that include R (in a position other than 2) and use other common letters.

Possible positions for R: we can try putting R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

To get more information, we might want to try a word that has R in a different position and includes other common consonants and vowels (but note: we know the word doesn't have A, I, E, so the vowels must be from O, U, and sometimes Y).

But note: the word might have other vowels like O or U.

Let me list some candidate words:

- Starting with R: words like ""ROUND"", ""ROBOT"", ""ROAST"" (but A and S are out, so not these). We cannot use A, I, S, E.

So, words without A, I, S, E and with R.

Possible words: 
- ""ROUTE"" -> but E is out, so no.
- ""ROUND"" -> no A, I, S, E? R, O, U, N, D -> yes, all allowed.
- ""CRONY"" -> C, R, O, N, Y -> no A, I, S, E -> allowed.
- ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> allowed.

But we also want to cover more common letters.

Another idea: since we know R is in the word, and we have to place it not in position 2, we can try position 1.

Let me try to form a word with R at the start and without the forbidden letters.

R at position 1: 
- R _ _ _ _

We need to fill the rest with letters not in {A, I, S, E} and that form a valid word.

Possible: 
- ROCKY (R, O, C, K, Y) -> but K and Y are less common? 
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) -> good, common letters.

But note: we also want to test other common consonants. We haven't tried T, N, L, etc.

Another candidate: ""ROTUND"" is 6 letters, too long.

""ROUND"" is 5 letters.

But we can also try R in position 3 or 4.

Alternatively, we might avoid putting R in position 1 because we don't know if it's there. We know it's not in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5.

To maximize information, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven't tested (like 1) and also introduces new common letters.

Let me think of words that have R and use common letters we haven't tried: like T, N, O, U, L, D, etc.

For example: 
- ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> R is in position 4? But we don't know if R is in 4. Also, no A, I, S, E -> valid.
- ""POUR"" is 4 letters, too short.
- ""GROUP"" -> G, R, O, U, P -> R is in position 2? But we cannot put R in position 2 because we already know it's not there? Actually, we can put R in position 2 again? But we know it's not in position 2, so it would be a waste of a position because we know it will be marked as '-' again? Actually, we can, but it doesn't give new information about the position of R. So it's better to try R in a new position.

So, we should avoid position 2 for R.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should place R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me list some words:

- R in position 1: ROUND, ROUTE (but E is out, so no), ROUTH (not common), ROUGH (U, G, H -> allowed), ROOMY (O, M, Y -> allowed, but two O's?).

But we don't know if the word has O or U.

Another: ""ROUGH"" -> R, O, U, G, H -> all allowed.

- R in position 3: We can try a word like ... R ... For example: ""CARRY"" -> but A is out, so no. ""BORED"" -> E is out. ""FURRY"" -> U, R, R, Y -> but we have two R's? The secret word might have two R's? We don't know. But we only know one R is present so far. But it could have two.

But we have to avoid A, I, S, E.

""BURLY"" -> B, U, R, L, Y -> allowed. R is in position 3.

- R in position 4: ""HORDE"" -> E is out. ""FORUM"" -> F, O, R, U, M -> allowed. R is in position 3? Let's count: F(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), M(5) -> so R is in position 3, not 4.

To have R in position 4: ""STARE"" -> but S and E are out. ""CHORE"" -> E out. ""LYRE"" is 4 letters. ""PURTY"" not a word. ""CURED"" -> E out. ""GOURD"" -> G, O, U, R, D -> R is in position 4? G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5) -> yes. And no A, I, S, E -> allowed.

- R in position 5: ""LATER"" -> E out. ""RUMOR"" -> R is in position 1 and 5? But we can use: ""RUMOR"" has R at 1 and 5, but we don't know if we can have two R's. Also, U, M, O -> allowed? But we have two R's. Alternatively, ""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> R at the end. Allowed.

But we want to cover more ground. We have only one known letter (R) and we know it's not in position 2.

I think a good strategy is to try R in a new position and also test other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (like T, N, L, etc.).

One classic second guess after ""ARISE"" with this feedback might be to try a word like ""ROUND"" or ""POUND"" (but POUND has no R). We need R.

So, let's go with ""ROUND"": 
- R in position 1 (which is new, we haven't tested position 1 for R)
- O, U, N, D are new letters.

But note: we are not sure if the word has O, U, N, D, but we are testing them.

Another candidate: ""COURT"" has R in position 3? C(1), O(2), U(3), R(4)? Wait, no: COURT is C-O-U-R-T, so positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:T -> so R is in position 4. And we haven't tested position 4 for R.

Also, COURT uses C, O, U, R, T -> all new letters (except R) and common.

But we don't have E, so it's valid.

Similarly, ""GROUP"": G(1), R(2), O(3), U(4), P(5) -> but R is in position 2, which we already know is wrong. So we would get '-' for R again, and we already know that. So it's better to avoid position 2 for R.

Therefore, avoid words with R in position 2.

So, ""COURT"" is good: R in position 4.

Another option: ""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> R in position 2? B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> position 2, which we want to avoid.

So not that.

""THORN"" -> T, H, O, R, N -> R in position 4? T(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> yes. And no A, I, S, E -> allowed.

But we also want to test U? Not necessarily.

I think ""COURT"" is a good choice because it tests C, O, U, T and R in a new position (4).

Alternatively, ""ROUND"" tests R, O, U, N, D with R in position 1.

Both are good.

But note: we have only one R, and we are testing it in a new position.

I'll go with ""ROUND"" because it tests R at position 1 and also includes common letters.

But let me check if ""ROUND"" is a valid word: yes.

So, my second guess: ROUND.

But wait, what if the secret word has R in position 1? Then we get a check. If not, we might get a minus for R and also learn about O, U, N, D.

Alternatively, if we use ""COURT"", we test R in position 4.

Since we don't have any information about position 1, it might be good to test R there.

I think either is fine.

I'll choose ""ROUND"".

But let me see: after ""arise"" with R being misplaced, and we know it's not in position 2, if we put R in position 1 and it's correct, that would be great. If not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.

So, I'll go with ""ROUND"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""arise"":
- A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word (marked with 'x').
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (marked with '-').

For the second guess:
- The word must include R (in a position other than 2) and exclude A, I, S, E.
- To maximize information, I chose a word with R in position 1 (a new position to test) and introduced new common letters: O, U, N, D.
- ""round"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits these criteria and helps test for other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (N, D).

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Without any prior information, a good starting word is one that includes common letters and has a balanced letter distribution.
 Common starting words in Wordle often contain multiple vowels and common consonants. Examples: ""CRATE"", ""ROATE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ARISE"", etc.
 I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains A, R, I, S, E which are common letters.For the first guess, I chose ""ARISE"" because it includes common vowels (A, I, E) and frequent consonants (R, S), maximizing the chance to uncover overlaps with the secret word. This provides a solid baseline for deducing the word structure.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""arise"":
- A: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since we placed it in the second position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains R (but not in position 2) and does not contain A, I, S, or E.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain A, I, S, E (since they are not in the word).
- Must contain R (and we know it's not in position 2, so we should place R in a different position: 1, 3, 4, or 5).

Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and covering different positions.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We should avoid using any of the discarded letters: A, I, S, E.

Let's think of words that include R (in a position other than 2) and use other common letters.

Possible positions for R: we can try putting R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

To get more information, we might want to try a word that has R in a different position and includes other common consonants and vowels (but note: we know the word doesn't have A, I, E, so the vowels must be from O, U, and sometimes Y).

But note: the word might have other vowels like O or U.

Let me list some candidate words:

- Starting with R: words like ""ROUND"", ""ROBOT"", ""ROAST"" (but A and S are out, so not these). We cannot use A, I, S, E.

So, words without A, I, S, E and with R.

Possible words: 
- ""ROUTE"" -> but E is out, so no.
- ""ROUND"" -> no A, I, S, E? R, O, U, N, D -> yes, all allowed.
- ""CRONY"" -> C, R, O, N, Y -> no A, I, S, E -> allowed.
- ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> allowed.

But we also want to cover more common letters.

Another idea: since we know R is in the word, and we have to place it not in position 2, we can try position 1.

Let me try to form a word with R at the start and without the forbidden letters.

R at position 1: 
- R _ _ _ _

We need to fill the rest with letters not in {A, I, S, E} and that form a valid word.

Possible: 
- ROCKY (R, O, C, K, Y) -> but K and Y are less common? 
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) -> good, common letters.

But note: we also want to test other common consonants. We haven't tried T, N, L, etc.

Another candidate: ""ROTUND"" is 6 letters, too long.

""ROUND"" is 5 letters.

But we can also try R in position 3 or 4.

Alternatively, we might avoid putting R in position 1 because we don't know if it's there. We know it's not in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5.

To maximize information, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven't tested (like 1) and also introduces new common letters.

Let me think of words that have R and use common letters we haven't tried: like T, N, O, U, L, D, etc.

For example: 
- ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> R is in position 4? But we don't know if R is in 4. Also, no A, I, S, E -> valid.
- ""POUR"" is 4 letters, too short.
- ""GROUP"" -> G, R, O, U, P -> R is in position 2? But we cannot put R in position 2 because we already know it's not there? Actually, we can put R in position 2 again? But we know it's not in position 2, so it would be a waste of a position because we know it will be marked as '-' again? Actually, we can, but it doesn't give new information about the position of R. So it's better to try R in a new position.

So, we should avoid position 2 for R.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should place R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me list some words:

- R in position 1: ROUND, ROUTE (but E is out, so no), ROUTH (not common), ROUGH (U, G, H -> allowed), ROOMY (O, M, Y -> allowed, but two O's?).

But we don't know if the word has O or U.

Another: ""ROUGH"" -> R, O, U, G, H -> all allowed.

- R in position 3: We can try a word like ... R ... For example: ""CARRY"" -> but A is out, so no. ""BORED"" -> E is out. ""FURRY"" -> U, R, R, Y -> but we have two R's? The secret word might have two R's? We don't know. But we only know one R is present so far. But it could have two.

But we have to avoid A, I, S, E.

""BURLY"" -> B, U, R, L, Y -> allowed. R is in position 3.

- R in position 4: ""HORDE"" -> E is out. ""FORUM"" -> F, O, R, U, M -> allowed. R is in position 3? Let's count: F(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), M(5) -> so R is in position 3, not 4.

To have R in position 4: ""STARE"" -> but S and E are out. ""CHORE"" -> E out. ""LYRE"" is 4 letters. ""PURTY"" not a word. ""CURED"" -> E out. ""GOURD"" -> G, O, U, R, D -> R is in position 4? G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5) -> yes. And no A, I, S, E -> allowed.

- R in position 5: ""LATER"" -> E out. ""RUMOR"" -> R is in position 1 and 5? But we can use: ""RUMOR"" has R at 1 and 5, but we don't know if we can have two R's. Also, U, M, O -> allowed? But we have two R's. Alternatively, ""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> R at the end. Allowed.

But we want to cover more ground. We have only one known letter (R) and we know it's not in position 2.

I think a good strategy is to try R in a new position and also test other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (like T, N, L, etc.).

One classic second guess after ""ARISE"" with this feedback might be to try a word like ""ROUND"" or ""POUND"" (but POUND has no R). We need R.

So, let's go with ""ROUND"": 
- R in position 1 (which is new, we haven't tested position 1 for R)
- O, U, N, D are new letters.

But note: we are not sure if the word has O, U, N, D, but we are testing them.

Another candidate: ""COURT"" has R in position 3? C(1), O(2), U(3), R(4)? Wait, no: COURT is C-O-U-R-T, so positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:T -> so R is in position 4. And we haven't tested position 4 for R.

Also, COURT uses C, O, U, R, T -> all new letters (except R) and common.

But we don't have E, so it's valid.

Similarly, ""GROUP"": G(1), R(2), O(3), U(4), P(5) -> but R is in position 2, which we already know is wrong. So we would get '-' for R again, and we already know that. So it's better to avoid position 2 for R.

Therefore, avoid words with R in position 2.

So, ""COURT"" is good: R in position 4.

Another option: ""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> R in position 2? B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> position 2, which we want to avoid.

So not that.

""THORN"" -> T, H, O, R, N -> R in position 4? T(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> yes. And no A, I, S, E -> allowed.

But we also want to test U? Not necessarily.

I think ""COURT"" is a good choice because it tests C, O, U, T and R in a new position (4).

Alternatively, ""ROUND"" tests R, O, U, N, D with R in position 1.

Both are good.

But note: we have only one R, and we are testing it in a new position.

I'll go with ""ROUND"" because it tests R at position 1 and also includes common letters.

But let me check if ""ROUND"" is a valid word: yes.

So, my second guess: ROUND.

But wait, what if the secret word has R in position 1? Then we get a check. If not, we might get a minus for R and also learn about O, U, N, D.

Alternatively, if we use ""COURT"", we test R in position 4.

Since we don't have any information about position 1, it might be good to test R there.

I think either is fine.

I'll choose ""ROUND"".

But let me see: after ""arise"" with R being misplaced, and we know it's not in position 2, if we put R in position 1 and it's correct, that would be great. If not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.

So, I'll go with ""ROUND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""arise"":
- A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word (marked with 'x').
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (marked with '-').

For the second guess:
- The word must include R (in a position other than 2) and exclude A, I, S, E.
- To maximize information, I chose a word with R in position 1 (a new position to test) and introduced new common letters: O, U, N, D.
- ""round"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits these criteria and helps test for other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (N, D).

We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess ""arise"":
  A: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, but wrong position; so R is not in position 2)
  I: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Second guess ""round"":
  R: - (in word, wrong position; so R is not in position 1 either, because we tried position 1 now and got '-')
  O: x (not in word)
  U: - (in word, wrong position; so U is in the word but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  D: x (not in word)

Now, we know:

Letters not in the word: A, I, S, E, O, N, D

Letters in the word: R and U

We also know the positions for R: it cannot be in position 1 (from ""round"") or position 2 (from ""arise""). So it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, U is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""round"").

We have used two guesses. We have four more.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R (in position 3, 4, or 5)
- Contains U (not in position 3)
- Does not contain A, I, S, E, O, N, D

Additionally, we can use other letters that haven't been tried yet.

The remaining letters (not tried and not excluded) are: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want to maximize information by covering new letters and different positions.

Also, we need to consider the positions for R and U.

Since R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and U must not be in 3, so U can be in 1,2,4,5. But note: we don't know the secret word, so U could be in any position but 3.

We can try to place R in one of the possible positions and U in another.

Let's list possible positions:

For R: 3,4,5
For U: 1,2,4,5

But note: if we put R and U in the same position? No, they are different letters.

We must avoid positions that we already know are wrong for these letters.

We haven't tested positions 4 and 5 for U, and positions 3,4,5 for R.

Possible words:

We need a word that has R in 3,4, or 5 and U somewhere else.

Since we don't know where U is, we can try to put U in a position we haven't tested. We have tested U in position 3 (got '-') and R in position 1 (got '-') and 2 (we didn't try? Wait, in ""arise"" R was in position 2 and got '-', so we know R is not in position 2). For U, only position 3 has been tried.

So we can try U in position 1,2,4,5.

Similarly for R, we have tried position 1 (in ""round"") and position 2 (in ""arise"") and both were '-', so R must be in 3,4, or 5.

Let us try to formulate words without the excluded letters and with R and U.

Excluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D

Available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also want common words to maximize the chance.

Try words with U and R.

Possible common letters: T, L, M, P, etc.

Words:

- If U is at position 1: then U _ _ R_ ? But we need to fill.

  U in 1, R in 4? Example: ""ULCER"" but E is excluded. ""ULTRA"" but A is excluded.

  ""ULTRA"" has A, which is out. No.

  ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E is excluded. No.

  ""UMPTY"" not a word.

  ""UNCUT"" has N and C? U, N, C, U, T? Wait, ""UNCUT"" has N (excluded) and U twice? Also N is excluded.

  We cannot use N.

  So, U in position 1: hard to find without excluded letters.

  Example: ""UPTURN"" too long.

  ""UTILE"" has E and I? U, T, I, L, E -> I and E excluded.

  Maybe ""UGLY"" too short?

  Let me think of common words: ""USURY"" has S? U, S, U, R, Y -> S is excluded.

  ""USURP"" -> U, S, U, R, P -> S excluded.

  Difficult with U at start.

- U at position 2: _ U _ _ _

  Then with R in position 3,4, or 5.

  Example: if R in 4: _ U _ R _

  Words: ""CURLY"" -> C, U, R, L, Y? But R is in position 3? Because C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5). But we want R in 4? Here R is in 3.

  We can have R in 3: so _ U R _ _

  Examples: ""BURMA"" but A excluded. ""BURQA"" not common. ""BURST"" has S excluded.

  ""CURVE"" -> C, U, R, V, E -> E excluded.

  ""CURVY"" -> C, U, R, V, Y -> and V and Y are allowed. But R is in position 3.

  But does it have excluded? Letters: C,U,R,V,Y -> no A,I,S,E,O,N,D -> acceptable.

  Also, it tests C, V, Y.

  Another: ""FURRY"" has two R's? F,U,R,R,Y -> but we don't know if R can be duplicated. But it might, so let's consider. However, we have R only once so far, but the secret word might have two R's? Yes, possible.

  But in ""curvy"", R is in position 3.

  Alternatively, if R in position 4: so _ U ? R _

  For example, ""GOURD"" but O excluded because in ""round"" O is x, so O not present.

  O is excluded? Yes, from ""round"": O(x), so O is not in the word.

  Similarly, in ""round"", O was guessed and marked x, so O is not in the word.

  So we must avoid O.

  ""GOURD"" has O? G,O,U,R,D -> O and D excluded.

  No.

  So for _ U _ R _, let's make a word: like ""PUTTY"" has U? P,U,T,T,Y -> but T,T. And R is missing? We need to have R.

  We need R in the word.

  So for U in 2, R in 4: we have pattern _ U ? R ? 

  Words: ""CURRY"" has R in 3 and 4? C,U,R,R,Y -> but position 3 is R and position 4 is R? Specifically: position 4 is R? No: C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) so yes R at position 4? Actually, the fourth letter is R. But we also have R at position 3? So ""CURRY"" has R at positions 3 and 4? It depends on the word.

  But we need only one R? Not necessarily.

  However, we know that R is present at least once. But it could be twice.

  But if we use two R's, we might get confused.

  Better to choose a word with U and R only once to avoid ambiguity.

  So, let's avoid duplicate letters for now.

  So, _ U ? R _ ? With no duplicates and no excluded letters.

  Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

  Suppose U in 2, R in 4: then positions:
  1: one of B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z
  2: U
  3: one of the available letters
  4: R
  5: one of the available letters

  Examples: 
  ""CURRY"" has two R's.
  ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> letters: M,U,R,K,Y -> all allowed? M, U, R, K, Y -> and no excluded? Yes. But R is in position 3? M(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). So R is in 3, not 4.

  If we want R in 4: so the letter in position 4 is R. So the letter after U must be the fourth? That is position 4.

  So the pattern: position 1: ?, 2: U, 3: some letter, 4: R, 5: ?

  Words: ""CURRY"" would have position 4 as R? In ""curry"": C(1),U(2),R(3),R(4) – wait, actually it's C(1),U(2),R(3),R(4) so position 4 is R.

  So ""CURRY"" works: U in 2 and R in 4? But in position 3 we also have R? So if the secret word has only one R, we might get multiple feedbacks.

  Another word: ""SURFY"" but S is excluded. ""HURRY"" has H,U,R,R,Y -> R at position 3 and 4? Similarly.

  ""LURCH"" -> L, U, R, C, H -> R is in position 3? L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)? Not 4.

  ""BURET"" has E? B,U,R,E,T -> E excluded.

  ""FUROR"" has O? F,U,R,O,R -> O excluded.

  ""PURTY"" not a word.

  ""MURTI"" not common.

  How about ""CURVY"" but R is in 3.

  Another word: ""BUYER"" has E? B,U,Y,E,R -> E excluded.

  This is challenging.

  Let's try U in position 4.

  Or perhaps U in position 5.

Let's try U in position 4: ... U

Pattern: ... U, so U in 4, and R in 3 or 5? Or in another position.

Position 4: U, then U cannot be in position 3 because we know U is not in 3, but 4 is fine.

Also R in 3,4,5? But if U in 4, and R in 4, same position? Not possible.

So R cannot be in 4 if U is there? But they are different letters.

U in 4, R in 3 or 5.

Similarly, U in 5: R in 3,4.

So let's pattern U in 4:

? ? ? U ?

With R somewhere.

If R in 3: ... then positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:R, 4:U, 5:?

But we need R in 3 and U in 4.

Words: ""TRUTH"" has T,R,U,T,H -> R at 2? T(1),R(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> not matching pattern.

""GRUMP"" -> G,R,U,M,P -> R in 2, U in 3? But U is in position 3, which we already know is not allowed for U (from ""round"", U was in position 3 and got '-')? No, wait: In ""round"", U was in position 3? Let me check ""round"": R(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> so U was in position 3 and got '-', meaning U is in the word but not in position 3. So we can try U in other positions, but not 3.

So for U in position 4: pattern _ _ R U ? or _ _ ? U R

If R in 3 and U in 4: then _ _ R U ?

Example: ""CHRUT"" not a word. ""FRUMP"" -> F,R,U,M,P -> but U is in 3? F(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5) -> not U in 4.

""TRUMUD"" too long.

""TRUMP"" -> T,R,U,M,P -> U in 3? T(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5) -> U in pos 3, not 4.

It's hard.

Perhaps U in position 5.

Pattern: ? ? ? ? U

With R in 3 or 4.

For example, R in 3: _ _ R ? U

Words: ""CARBU"" not a word.

""MARAU"" not a word.

Common word: ""THUMB"" but U is not at end. H is position? T,H,U,M,B -> U is 3.

""VAGUER"" too long.

Perhaps not common.

Since U is a vowel and we have few vowels left we can try, but the word must have U.

Another idea: use U in position 2 and R in position 5.

Pattern: _ U _ _ R

So U in 2, R in 5.

Words: ""QUOTER"" has O and E? Q,U,O,T,E,R -> O and E excluded.

""JUMAR"" not common.

""HUMIC"" not common.

""LUMBRICAL"" too long.

"" buy r"" not.

""PURER"" has E? P,U,R,E,R -> E excluded.

""PUFFR"" not a word.

""CURVY"" is C,U,R,V,Y -> U in 2, R in 3, Y in 4? C(1),U(2),R(3),V(4),Y(5) so R in 3.

But we can accept R in 3.

Perhaps ""curvy"" is a good option.

Similarly, ""BURMA"" has A but excluded.

I think ""CURVY"" is a valid word and it uses common letters.

It has:
- C: new
- U: at position 2? But in ""CURVY"", U is in position 2, which hasn't been tested yet.
- R: in position 3, which is a possible location for R.
- V: new
- Y: new

Also, avoids all excluded letters.

But what about U in position 2? We don't know if it is valid or not, but we are testing it.

Since we know U is not in position 3, but position 2 could be.

R in position 3 could be correct.

So ""curvy"" seems okay.

Another word: ""TRYST"" but no U.

We must include U and R.

""GLYPH"" no U.

I think ""curvy"" is fine.

But let's confirm the letters: C, U, R, V, Y -> all not excluded.

So let's go with ""CURVY"".

But in the pattern, U is in positions 2 and R in 3.

We haven't tested position 2 for U, so it might be correct or wrong.

If U is not in position 2, we'll get a '-' if it's elsewhere or 'x' if not present? But we know U is present, so if not in 2, we'll get '-' again.

Similarly for R, if in 3, we might get a check or minus.

Another possibility: ""HUMOR"" has O, excluded.

""LYTUR"" not a word.

So ""CURVY"" is acceptable.

Therefore, I'll guess ""CURVY"".Based on the feedback:

- Excluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D
- Must include: R and U
- R positions: must be in 3,4, or 5 (cannot be in 1 or 2 per previous guesses)
- U was tested in position 3 and was wrong, so must be in 1,2,4,5

Chose ""CURVY"": 
- Places R in position 3 to test if it is correct there
- Places U in position 2, a new position to test
- Introduces new common letters: C, V, Y
- Word is valid and avoids all excluded letters

<guess>curvy</guess>
</think>
After the first guess ""arise"" revealed that R is in the word but not in position 2, and A, I, S, E are not in the word, the second guess ""round"" provided additional feedback: R is not in position 1, O is not in the word, U is in the word but not in position 3, and N and D are not in the word.

### Current Deductions:
1. **Excluded Letters**: A, I, S, E, O, N, D (from 'x' feedback).
2. **Confirmed Letters**: R and U must be in the word.
   - R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (must be in 3, 4, or 5).
   - U cannot be in position 3 (must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5).
3. **Available Letters**: All unused consonants and vowels: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- The word must include R (in position 3, 4, or 5) and U (in position 1, 2, 4, or 5), and exclude all eliminated letters.
- Prioritize testing R in a new, untested position (e.g., position 3) to narrow its location, as positions 1 and 2 are ruled out.
- Test U in a new position (e.g., position 2) since position 3 is invalid and position 1 hasn't been tested.
- Introduce new common letters like C, V, and Y to maximize information if they are incorrect or reveal positions.
- Avoid reused positions for R and U where possible to gain new data.
- ""Curvy"" fits these criteria:
  - U in position 2 (previously untested for U) to check if correct or misplaced.
  - R in position 3 (a potential valid position) to test for correctness.
  - Uses C, V, and Y, which are common and untested.
  - Valid word with no excluded letters.

This guess efficiently covers two possible positions for U and R while introducing three new letters to accelerate process of elimination.

<guess>curvy</guess>",curvy,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess ""arise"":
  A: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, but wrong position; so R is not in position 2)
  I: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Second guess ""round"":
  R: - (in word, wrong position; so R is not in position 1 either, because we tried position 1 now and got '-')
  O: x (not in word)
  U: - (in word, wrong position; so U is in the word but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  D: x (not in word)

Now, we know:

Letters not in the word: A, I, S, E, O, N, D

Letters in the word: R and U

We also know the positions for R: it cannot be in position 1 (from ""round"") or position 2 (from ""arise""). So it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, U is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""round"").

We have used two guesses. We have four more.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R (in position 3, 4, or 5)
- Contains U (not in position 3)
- Does not contain A, I, S, E, O, N, D

Additionally, we can use other letters that haven't been tried yet.

The remaining letters (not tried and not excluded) are: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want to maximize information by covering new letters and different positions.

Also, we need to consider the positions for R and U.

Since R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and U must not be in 3, so U can be in 1,2,4,5. But note: we don't know the secret word, so U could be in any position but 3.

We can try to place R in one of the possible positions and U in another.

Let's list possible positions:

For R: 3,4,5
For U: 1,2,4,5

But note: if we put R and U in the same position? No, they are different letters.

We must avoid positions that we already know are wrong for these letters.

We haven't tested positions 4 and 5 for U, and positions 3,4,5 for R.

Possible words:

We need a word that has R in 3,4, or 5 and U somewhere else.

Since we don't know where U is, we can try to put U in a position we haven't tested. We have tested U in position 3 (got '-') and R in position 1 (got '-') and 2 (we didn't try? Wait, in ""arise"" R was in position 2 and got '-', so we know R is not in position 2). For U, only position 3 has been tried.

So we can try U in position 1,2,4,5.

Similarly for R, we have tried position 1 (in ""round"") and position 2 (in ""arise"") and both were '-', so R must be in 3,4, or 5.

Let us try to formulate words without the excluded letters and with R and U.

Excluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D

Available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also want common words to maximize the chance.

Try words with U and R.

Possible common letters: T, L, M, P, etc.

Words:

- If U is at position 1: then U _ _ R_ ? But we need to fill.

  U in 1, R in 4? Example: ""ULCER"" but E is excluded. ""ULTRA"" but A is excluded.

  ""ULTRA"" has A, which is out. No.

  ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E is excluded. No.

  ""UMPTY"" not a word.

  ""UNCUT"" has N and C? U, N, C, U, T? Wait, ""UNCUT"" has N (excluded) and U twice? Also N is excluded.

  We cannot use N.

  So, U in position 1: hard to find without excluded letters.

  Example: ""UPTURN"" too long.

  ""UTILE"" has E and I? U, T, I, L, E -> I and E excluded.

  Maybe ""UGLY"" too short?

  Let me think of common words: ""USURY"" has S? U, S, U, R, Y -> S is excluded.

  ""USURP"" -> U, S, U, R, P -> S excluded.

  Difficult with U at start.

- U at position 2: _ U _ _ _

  Then with R in position 3,4, or 5.

  Example: if R in 4: _ U _ R _

  Words: ""CURLY"" -> C, U, R, L, Y? But R is in position 3? Because C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5). But we want R in 4? Here R is in 3.

  We can have R in 3: so _ U R _ _

  Examples: ""BURMA"" but A excluded. ""BURQA"" not common. ""BURST"" has S excluded.

  ""CURVE"" -> C, U, R, V, E -> E excluded.

  ""CURVY"" -> C, U, R, V, Y -> and V and Y are allowed. But R is in position 3.

  But does it have excluded? Letters: C,U,R,V,Y -> no A,I,S,E,O,N,D -> acceptable.

  Also, it tests C, V, Y.

  Another: ""FURRY"" has two R's? F,U,R,R,Y -> but we don't know if R can be duplicated. But it might, so let's consider. However, we have R only once so far, but the secret word might have two R's? Yes, possible.

  But in ""curvy"", R is in position 3.

  Alternatively, if R in position 4: so _ U ? R _

  For example, ""GOURD"" but O excluded because in ""round"" O is x, so O not present.

  O is excluded? Yes, from ""round"": O(x), so O is not in the word.

  Similarly, in ""round"", O was guessed and marked x, so O is not in the word.

  So we must avoid O.

  ""GOURD"" has O? G,O,U,R,D -> O and D excluded.

  No.

  So for _ U _ R _, let's make a word: like ""PUTTY"" has U? P,U,T,T,Y -> but T,T. And R is missing? We need to have R.

  We need R in the word.

  So for U in 2, R in 4: we have pattern _ U ? R ? 

  Words: ""CURRY"" has R in 3 and 4? C,U,R,R,Y -> but position 3 is R and position 4 is R? Specifically: position 4 is R? No: C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) so yes R at position 4? Actually, the fourth letter is R. But we also have R at position 3? So ""CURRY"" has R at positions 3 and 4? It depends on the word.

  But we need only one R? Not necessarily.

  However, we know that R is present at least once. But it could be twice.

  But if we use two R's, we might get confused.

  Better to choose a word with U and R only once to avoid ambiguity.

  So, let's avoid duplicate letters for now.

  So, _ U ? R _ ? With no duplicates and no excluded letters.

  Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

  Suppose U in 2, R in 4: then positions:
  1: one of B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z
  2: U
  3: one of the available letters
  4: R
  5: one of the available letters

  Examples: 
  ""CURRY"" has two R's.
  ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> letters: M,U,R,K,Y -> all allowed? M, U, R, K, Y -> and no excluded? Yes. But R is in position 3? M(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). So R is in 3, not 4.

  If we want R in 4: so the letter in position 4 is R. So the letter after U must be the fourth? That is position 4.

  So the pattern: position 1: ?, 2: U, 3: some letter, 4: R, 5: ?

  Words: ""CURRY"" would have position 4 as R? In ""curry"": C(1),U(2),R(3),R(4) – wait, actually it's C(1),U(2),R(3),R(4) so position 4 is R.

  So ""CURRY"" works: U in 2 and R in 4? But in position 3 we also have R? So if the secret word has only one R, we might get multiple feedbacks.

  Another word: ""SURFY"" but S is excluded. ""HURRY"" has H,U,R,R,Y -> R at position 3 and 4? Similarly.

  ""LURCH"" -> L, U, R, C, H -> R is in position 3? L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)? Not 4.

  ""BURET"" has E? B,U,R,E,T -> E excluded.

  ""FUROR"" has O? F,U,R,O,R -> O excluded.

  ""PURTY"" not a word.

  ""MURTI"" not common.

  How about ""CURVY"" but R is in 3.

  Another word: ""BUYER"" has E? B,U,Y,E,R -> E excluded.

  This is challenging.

  Let's try U in position 4.

  Or perhaps U in position 5.

Let's try U in position 4: ... U

Pattern: ... U, so U in 4, and R in 3 or 5? Or in another position.

Position 4: U, then U cannot be in position 3 because we know U is not in 3, but 4 is fine.

Also R in 3,4,5? But if U in 4, and R in 4, same position? Not possible.

So R cannot be in 4 if U is there? But they are different letters.

U in 4, R in 3 or 5.

Similarly, U in 5: R in 3,4.

So let's pattern U in 4:

? ? ? U ?

With R somewhere.

If R in 3: ... then positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:R, 4:U, 5:?

But we need R in 3 and U in 4.

Words: ""TRUTH"" has T,R,U,T,H -> R at 2? T(1),R(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> not matching pattern.

""GRUMP"" -> G,R,U,M,P -> R in 2, U in 3? But U is in position 3, which we already know is not allowed for U (from ""round"", U was in position 3 and got '-')? No, wait: In ""round"", U was in position 3? Let me check ""round"": R(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> so U was in position 3 and got '-', meaning U is in the word but not in position 3. So we can try U in other positions, but not 3.

So for U in position 4: pattern _ _ R U ? or _ _ ? U R

If R in 3 and U in 4: then _ _ R U ?

Example: ""CHRUT"" not a word. ""FRUMP"" -> F,R,U,M,P -> but U is in 3? F(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5) -> not U in 4.

""TRUMUD"" too long.

""TRUMP"" -> T,R,U,M,P -> U in 3? T(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5) -> U in pos 3, not 4.

It's hard.

Perhaps U in position 5.

Pattern: ? ? ? ? U

With R in 3 or 4.

For example, R in 3: _ _ R ? U

Words: ""CARBU"" not a word.

""MARAU"" not a word.

Common word: ""THUMB"" but U is not at end. H is position? T,H,U,M,B -> U is 3.

""VAGUER"" too long.

Perhaps not common.

Since U is a vowel and we have few vowels left we can try, but the word must have U.

Another idea: use U in position 2 and R in position 5.

Pattern: _ U _ _ R

So U in 2, R in 5.

Words: ""QUOTER"" has O and E? Q,U,O,T,E,R -> O and E excluded.

""JUMAR"" not common.

""HUMIC"" not common.

""LUMBRICAL"" too long.

"" buy r"" not.

""PURER"" has E? P,U,R,E,R -> E excluded.

""PUFFR"" not a word.

""CURVY"" is C,U,R,V,Y -> U in 2, R in 3, Y in 4? C(1),U(2),R(3),V(4),Y(5) so R in 3.

But we can accept R in 3.

Perhaps ""curvy"" is a good option.

Similarly, ""BURMA"" has A but excluded.

I think ""CURVY"" is a valid word and it uses common letters.

It has:
- C: new
- U: at position 2? But in ""CURVY"", U is in position 2, which hasn't been tested yet.
- R: in position 3, which is a possible location for R.
- V: new
- Y: new

Also, avoids all excluded letters.

But what about U in position 2? We don't know if it is valid or not, but we are testing it.

Since we know U is not in position 3, but position 2 could be.

R in position 3 could be correct.

So ""curvy"" seems okay.

Another word: ""TRYST"" but no U.

We must include U and R.

""GLYPH"" no U.

I think ""curvy"" is fine.

But let's confirm the letters: C, U, R, V, Y -> all not excluded.

So let's go with ""CURVY"".

But in the pattern, U is in positions 2 and R in 3.

We haven't tested position 2 for U, so it might be correct or wrong.

If U is not in position 2, we'll get a '-' if it's elsewhere or 'x' if not present? But we know U is present, so if not in 2, we'll get '-' again.

Similarly for R, if in 3, we might get a check or minus.

Another possibility: ""HUMOR"" has O, excluded.

""LYTUR"" not a word.

So ""CURVY"" is acceptable.

Therefore, I'll guess ""CURVY"".Based on the feedback:

- Excluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D
- Must include: R and U
- R positions: must be in 3,4, or 5 (cannot be in 1 or 2 per previous guesses)
- U was tested in position 3 and was wrong, so must be in 1,2,4,5

Chose ""CURVY"": 
- Places R in position 3 to test if it is correct there
- Places U in position 2, a new position to test
- Introduces new common letters: C, V, Y
- Word is valid and avoids all excluded letters

3. **Available Letters**: All unused consonants and vowels: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Without any prior information, a good starting word is one that includes common letters and has a balanced letter distribution.
 Common starting words in Wordle often contain multiple vowels and common consonants. Examples: ""CRATE"", ""ROATE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ARISE"", etc.
 I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains A, R, I, S, E which are common letters.For the first guess, I chose ""ARISE"" because it includes common vowels (A, I, E) and frequent consonants (R, S), maximizing the chance to uncover overlaps with the secret word. This provides a solid baseline for deducing the word structure.

<guess>arise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""arise"":
- A: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since we placed it in the second position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains R (but not in position 2) and does not contain A, I, S, or E.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain A, I, S, E (since they are not in the word).
- Must contain R (and we know it's not in position 2, so we should place R in a different position: 1, 3, 4, or 5).

Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and covering different positions.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We should avoid using any of the discarded letters: A, I, S, E.

Let's think of words that include R (in a position other than 2) and use other common letters.

Possible positions for R: we can try putting R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

To get more information, we might want to try a word that has R in a different position and includes other common consonants and vowels (but note: we know the word doesn't have A, I, E, so the vowels must be from O, U, and sometimes Y).

But note: the word might have other vowels like O or U.

Let me list some candidate words:

- Starting with R: words like ""ROUND"", ""ROBOT"", ""ROAST"" (but A and S are out, so not these). We cannot use A, I, S, E.

So, words without A, I, S, E and with R.

Possible words: 
- ""ROUTE"" -> but E is out, so no.
- ""ROUND"" -> no A, I, S, E? R, O, U, N, D -> yes, all allowed.
- ""CRONY"" -> C, R, O, N, Y -> no A, I, S, E -> allowed.
- ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> allowed.

But we also want to cover more common letters.

Another idea: since we know R is in the word, and we have to place it not in position 2, we can try position 1.

Let me try to form a word with R at the start and without the forbidden letters.

R at position 1: 
- R _ _ _ _

We need to fill the rest with letters not in {A, I, S, E} and that form a valid word.

Possible: 
- ROCKY (R, O, C, K, Y) -> but K and Y are less common? 
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) -> good, common letters.

But note: we also want to test other common consonants. We haven't tried T, N, L, etc.

Another candidate: ""ROTUND"" is 6 letters, too long.

""ROUND"" is 5 letters.

But we can also try R in position 3 or 4.

Alternatively, we might avoid putting R in position 1 because we don't know if it's there. We know it's not in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5.

To maximize information, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven't tested (like 1) and also introduces new common letters.

Let me think of words that have R and use common letters we haven't tried: like T, N, O, U, L, D, etc.

For example: 
- ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> R is in position 4? But we don't know if R is in 4. Also, no A, I, S, E -> valid.
- ""POUR"" is 4 letters, too short.
- ""GROUP"" -> G, R, O, U, P -> R is in position 2? But we cannot put R in position 2 because we already know it's not there? Actually, we can put R in position 2 again? But we know it's not in position 2, so it would be a waste of a position because we know it will be marked as '-' again? Actually, we can, but it doesn't give new information about the position of R. So it's better to try R in a new position.

So, we should avoid position 2 for R.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should place R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me list some words:

- R in position 1: ROUND, ROUTE (but E is out, so no), ROUTH (not common), ROUGH (U, G, H -> allowed), ROOMY (O, M, Y -> allowed, but two O's?).

But we don't know if the word has O or U.

Another: ""ROUGH"" -> R, O, U, G, H -> all allowed.

- R in position 3: We can try a word like ... R ... For example: ""CARRY"" -> but A is out, so no. ""BORED"" -> E is out. ""FURRY"" -> U, R, R, Y -> but we have two R's? The secret word might have two R's? We don't know. But we only know one R is present so far. But it could have two.

But we have to avoid A, I, S, E.

""BURLY"" -> B, U, R, L, Y -> allowed. R is in position 3.

- R in position 4: ""HORDE"" -> E is out. ""FORUM"" -> F, O, R, U, M -> allowed. R is in position 3? Let's count: F(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), M(5) -> so R is in position 3, not 4.

To have R in position 4: ""STARE"" -> but S and E are out. ""CHORE"" -> E out. ""LYRE"" is 4 letters. ""PURTY"" not a word. ""CURED"" -> E out. ""GOURD"" -> G, O, U, R, D -> R is in position 4? G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5) -> yes. And no A, I, S, E -> allowed.

- R in position 5: ""LATER"" -> E out. ""RUMOR"" -> R is in position 1 and 5? But we can use: ""RUMOR"" has R at 1 and 5, but we don't know if we can have two R's. Also, U, M, O -> allowed? But we have two R's. Alternatively, ""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> R at the end. Allowed.

But we want to cover more ground. We have only one known letter (R) and we know it's not in position 2.

I think a good strategy is to try R in a new position and also test other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (like T, N, L, etc.).

One classic second guess after ""ARISE"" with this feedback might be to try a word like ""ROUND"" or ""POUND"" (but POUND has no R). We need R.

So, let's go with ""ROUND"": 
- R in position 1 (which is new, we haven't tested position 1 for R)
- O, U, N, D are new letters.

But note: we are not sure if the word has O, U, N, D, but we are testing them.

Another candidate: ""COURT"" has R in position 3? C(1), O(2), U(3), R(4)? Wait, no: COURT is C-O-U-R-T, so positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:T -> so R is in position 4. And we haven't tested position 4 for R.

Also, COURT uses C, O, U, R, T -> all new letters (except R) and common.

But we don't have E, so it's valid.

Similarly, ""GROUP"": G(1), R(2), O(3), U(4), P(5) -> but R is in position 2, which we already know is wrong. So we would get '-' for R again, and we already know that. So it's better to avoid position 2 for R.

Therefore, avoid words with R in position 2.

So, ""COURT"" is good: R in position 4.

Another option: ""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> R in position 2? B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> position 2, which we want to avoid.

So not that.

""THORN"" -> T, H, O, R, N -> R in position 4? T(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> yes. And no A, I, S, E -> allowed.

But we also want to test U? Not necessarily.

I think ""COURT"" is a good choice because it tests C, O, U, T and R in a new position (4).

Alternatively, ""ROUND"" tests R, O, U, N, D with R in position 1.

Both are good.

But note: we have only one R, and we are testing it in a new position.

I'll go with ""ROUND"" because it tests R at position 1 and also includes common letters.

But let me check if ""ROUND"" is a valid word: yes.

So, my second guess: ROUND.

But wait, what if the secret word has R in position 1? Then we get a check. If not, we might get a minus for R and also learn about O, U, N, D.

Alternatively, if we use ""COURT"", we test R in position 4.

Since we don't have any information about position 1, it might be good to test R there.

I think either is fine.

I'll choose ""ROUND"".

But let me see: after ""arise"" with R being misplaced, and we know it's not in position 2, if we put R in position 1 and it's correct, that would be great. If not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.

So, I'll go with ""ROUND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""arise"":
- A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word (marked with 'x').
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (marked with '-').

For the second guess:
- The word must include R (in a position other than 2) and exclude A, I, S, E.
- To maximize information, I chose a word with R in position 1 (a new position to test) and introduced new common letters: O, U, N, D.
- ""round"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits these criteria and helps test for other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (N, D).

<guess>round</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: round -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess ""arise"":
  A: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, but wrong position; so R is not in position 2)
  I: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Second guess ""round"":
  R: - (in word, wrong position; so R is not in position 1 either, because we tried position 1 now and got '-')
  O: x (not in word)
  U: - (in word, wrong position; so U is in the word but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  D: x (not in word)

Now, we know:

Letters not in the word: A, I, S, E, O, N, D

Letters in the word: R and U

We also know the positions for R: it cannot be in position 1 (from ""round"") or position 2 (from ""arise""). So it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, U is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""round"").

We have used two guesses. We have four more.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R (in position 3, 4, or 5)
- Contains U (not in position 3)
- Does not contain A, I, S, E, O, N, D

Additionally, we can use other letters that haven't been tried yet.

The remaining letters (not tried and not excluded) are: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want to maximize information by covering new letters and different positions.

Also, we need to consider the positions for R and U.

Since R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and U must not be in 3, so U can be in 1,2,4,5. But note: we don't know the secret word, so U could be in any position but 3.

We can try to place R in one of the possible positions and U in another.

Let's list possible positions:

For R: 3,4,5
For U: 1,2,4,5

But note: if we put R and U in the same position? No, they are different letters.

We must avoid positions that we already know are wrong for these letters.

We haven't tested positions 4 and 5 for U, and positions 3,4,5 for R.

Possible words:

We need a word that has R in 3,4, or 5 and U somewhere else.

Since we don't know where U is, we can try to put U in a position we haven't tested. We have tested U in position 3 (got '-') and R in position 1 (got '-') and 2 (we didn't try? Wait, in ""arise"" R was in position 2 and got '-', so we know R is not in position 2). For U, only position 3 has been tried.

So we can try U in position 1,2,4,5.

Similarly for R, we have tried position 1 (in ""round"") and position 2 (in ""arise"") and both were '-', so R must be in 3,4, or 5.

Let us try to formulate words without the excluded letters and with R and U.

Excluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D

Available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also want common words to maximize the chance.

Try words with U and R.

Possible common letters: T, L, M, P, etc.

Words:

- If U is at position 1: then U _ _ R_ ? But we need to fill.

  U in 1, R in 4? Example: ""ULCER"" but E is excluded. ""ULTRA"" but A is excluded.

  ""ULTRA"" has A, which is out. No.

  ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E is excluded. No.

  ""UMPTY"" not a word.

  ""UNCUT"" has N and C? U, N, C, U, T? Wait, ""UNCUT"" has N (excluded) and U twice? Also N is excluded.

  We cannot use N.

  So, U in position 1: hard to find without excluded letters.

  Example: ""UPTURN"" too long.

  ""UTILE"" has E and I? U, T, I, L, E -> I and E excluded.

  Maybe ""UGLY"" too short?

  Let me think of common words: ""USURY"" has S? U, S, U, R, Y -> S is excluded.

  ""USURP"" -> U, S, U, R, P -> S excluded.

  Difficult with U at start.

- U at position 2: _ U _ _ _

  Then with R in position 3,4, or 5.

  Example: if R in 4: _ U _ R _

  Words: ""CURLY"" -> C, U, R, L, Y? But R is in position 3? Because C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5). But we want R in 4? Here R is in 3.

  We can have R in 3: so _ U R _ _

  Examples: ""BURMA"" but A excluded. ""BURQA"" not common. ""BURST"" has S excluded.

  ""CURVE"" -> C, U, R, V, E -> E excluded.

  ""CURVY"" -> C, U, R, V, Y -> and V and Y are allowed. But R is in position 3.

  But does it have excluded? Letters: C,U,R,V,Y -> no A,I,S,E,O,N,D -> acceptable.

  Also, it tests C, V, Y.

  Another: ""FURRY"" has two R's? F,U,R,R,Y -> but we don't know if R can be duplicated. But it might, so let's consider. However, we have R only once so far, but the secret word might have two R's? Yes, possible.

  But in ""curvy"", R is in position 3.

  Alternatively, if R in position 4: so _ U ? R _

  For example, ""GOURD"" but O excluded because in ""round"" O is x, so O not present.

  O is excluded? Yes, from ""round"": O(x), so O is not in the word.

  Similarly, in ""round"", O was guessed and marked x, so O is not in the word.

  So we must avoid O.

  ""GOURD"" has O? G,O,U,R,D -> O and D excluded.

  No.

  So for _ U _ R _, let's make a word: like ""PUTTY"" has U? P,U,T,T,Y -> but T,T. And R is missing? We need to have R.

  We need R in the word.

  So for U in 2, R in 4: we have pattern _ U ? R ? 

  Words: ""CURRY"" has R in 3 and 4? C,U,R,R,Y -> but position 3 is R and position 4 is R? Specifically: position 4 is R? No: C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) so yes R at position 4? Actually, the fourth letter is R. But we also have R at position 3? So ""CURRY"" has R at positions 3 and 4? It depends on the word.

  But we need only one R? Not necessarily.

  However, we know that R is present at least once. But it could be twice.

  But if we use two R's, we might get confused.

  Better to choose a word with U and R only once to avoid ambiguity.

  So, let's avoid duplicate letters for now.

  So, _ U ? R _ ? With no duplicates and no excluded letters.

  Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

  Suppose U in 2, R in 4: then positions:
  1: one of B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z
  2: U
  3: one of the available letters
  4: R
  5: one of the available letters

  Examples: 
  ""CURRY"" has two R's.
  ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> letters: M,U,R,K,Y -> all allowed? M, U, R, K, Y -> and no excluded? Yes. But R is in position 3? M(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). So R is in 3, not 4.

  If we want R in 4: so the letter in position 4 is R. So the letter after U must be the fourth? That is position 4.

  So the pattern: position 1: ?, 2: U, 3: some letter, 4: R, 5: ?

  Words: ""CURRY"" would have position 4 as R? In ""curry"": C(1),U(2),R(3),R(4) – wait, actually it's C(1),U(2),R(3),R(4) so position 4 is R.

  So ""CURRY"" works: U in 2 and R in 4? But in position 3 we also have R? So if the secret word has only one R, we might get multiple feedbacks.

  Another word: ""SURFY"" but S is excluded. ""HURRY"" has H,U,R,R,Y -> R at position 3 and 4? Similarly.

  ""LURCH"" -> L, U, R, C, H -> R is in position 3? L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)? Not 4.

  ""BURET"" has E? B,U,R,E,T -> E excluded.

  ""FUROR"" has O? F,U,R,O,R -> O excluded.

  ""PURTY"" not a word.

  ""MURTI"" not common.

  How about ""CURVY"" but R is in 3.

  Another word: ""BUYER"" has E? B,U,Y,E,R -> E excluded.

  This is challenging.

  Let's try U in position 4.

  Or perhaps U in position 5.

Let's try U in position 4: ... U

Pattern: ... U, so U in 4, and R in 3 or 5? Or in another position.

Position 4: U, then U cannot be in position 3 because we know U is not in 3, but 4 is fine.

Also R in 3,4,5? But if U in 4, and R in 4, same position? Not possible.

So R cannot be in 4 if U is there? But they are different letters.

U in 4, R in 3 or 5.

Similarly, U in 5: R in 3,4.

So let's pattern U in 4:

? ? ? U ?

With R somewhere.

If R in 3: ... then positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:R, 4:U, 5:?

But we need R in 3 and U in 4.

Words: ""TRUTH"" has T,R,U,T,H -> R at 2? T(1),R(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> not matching pattern.

""GRUMP"" -> G,R,U,M,P -> R in 2, U in 3? But U is in position 3, which we already know is not allowed for U (from ""round"", U was in position 3 and got '-')? No, wait: In ""round"", U was in position 3? Let me check ""round"": R(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> so U was in position 3 and got '-', meaning U is in the word but not in position 3. So we can try U in other positions, but not 3.

So for U in position 4: pattern _ _ R U ? or _ _ ? U R

If R in 3 and U in 4: then _ _ R U ?

Example: ""CHRUT"" not a word. ""FRUMP"" -> F,R,U,M,P -> but U is in 3? F(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5) -> not U in 4.

""TRUMUD"" too long.

""TRUMP"" -> T,R,U,M,P -> U in 3? T(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5) -> U in pos 3, not 4.

It's hard.

Perhaps U in position 5.

Pattern: ? ? ? ? U

With R in 3 or 4.

For example, R in 3: _ _ R ? U

Words: ""CARBU"" not a word.

""MARAU"" not a word.

Common word: ""THUMB"" but U is not at end. H is position? T,H,U,M,B -> U is 3.

""VAGUER"" too long.

Perhaps not common.

Since U is a vowel and we have few vowels left we can try, but the word must have U.

Another idea: use U in position 2 and R in position 5.

Pattern: _ U _ _ R

So U in 2, R in 5.

Words: ""QUOTER"" has O and E? Q,U,O,T,E,R -> O and E excluded.

""JUMAR"" not common.

""HUMIC"" not common.

""LUMBRICAL"" too long.

"" buy r"" not.

""PURER"" has E? P,U,R,E,R -> E excluded.

""PUFFR"" not a word.

""CURVY"" is C,U,R,V,Y -> U in 2, R in 3, Y in 4? C(1),U(2),R(3),V(4),Y(5) so R in 3.

But we can accept R in 3.

Perhaps ""curvy"" is a good option.

Similarly, ""BURMA"" has A but excluded.

I think ""CURVY"" is a valid word and it uses common letters.

It has:
- C: new
- U: at position 2? But in ""CURVY"", U is in position 2, which hasn't been tested yet.
- R: in position 3, which is a possible location for R.
- V: new
- Y: new

Also, avoids all excluded letters.

But what about U in position 2? We don't know if it is valid or not, but we are testing it.

Since we know U is not in position 3, but position 2 could be.

R in position 3 could be correct.

So ""curvy"" seems okay.

Another word: ""TRYST"" but no U.

We must include U and R.

""GLYPH"" no U.

I think ""curvy"" is fine.

But let's confirm the letters: C, U, R, V, Y -> all not excluded.

So let's go with ""CURVY"".

But in the pattern, U is in positions 2 and R in 3.

We haven't tested position 2 for U, so it might be correct or wrong.

If U is not in position 2, we'll get a '-' if it's elsewhere or 'x' if not present? But we know U is present, so if not in 2, we'll get '-' again.

Similarly for R, if in 3, we might get a check or minus.

Another possibility: ""HUMOR"" has O, excluded.

""LYTUR"" not a word.

So ""CURVY"" is acceptable.

Therefore, I'll guess ""CURVY"".Based on the feedback:

- Excluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D
- Must include: R and U
- R positions: must be in 3,4, or 5 (cannot be in 1 or 2 per previous guesses)
- U was tested in position 3 and was wrong, so must be in 1,2,4,5

Chose ""CURVY"": 
- Places R in position 3 to test if it is correct there
- Places U in position 2, a new position to test
- Introduces new common letters: C, V, Y
- Word is valid and avoids all excluded letters

<guess>curvy</guess>After the first guess ""arise"" revealed that R is in the word but not in position 2, and A, I, S, E are not in the word, the second guess ""round"" provided additional feedback: R is not in position 1, O is not in the word, U is in the word but not in position 3, and N and D are not in the word.

### Current Deductions:
1. **Excluded Letters**: A, I, S, E, O, N, D (from 'x' feedback).
2. **Confirmed Letters**: R and U must be in the word.
   - R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (must be in 3, 4, or 5).
   - U cannot be in position 3 (must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5).
3. **Available Letters**: All unused consonants and vowels: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- The word must include R (in position 3, 4, or 5) and U (in position 1, 2, 4, or 5), and exclude all eliminated letters.
- Prioritize testing R in a new, untested position (e.g., position 3) to narrow its location, as positions 1 and 2 are ruled out.
- Test U in a new position (e.g., position 2) since position 3 is invalid and position 1 hasn't been tested.
- Introduce new common letters like C, V, and Y to maximize information if they are incorrect or reveal positions.
- Avoid reused positions for R and U where possible to gain new data.
- ""Curvy"" fits these criteria:
  - U in position 2 (previously untested for U) to check if correct or misplaced.
  - R in position 3 (a potential valid position) to test for correctness.
  - Uses C, V, and Y, which are common and untested.
  - Valid word with no excluded letters.

This guess efficiently covers two possible positions for U and R while introducing three new letters to accelerate process of elimination.

We cannot use A, I, S, E.\n\nSo, words without A, I, S, E and with R.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""ROUTE"" -> but E is out, so no.\n- ""ROUND"" -> no A, I, S, E? R, O, U, N, D -> yes, all allowed.\n- ""CRONY"" -> C, R, O, N, Y -> no A, I, S, E -> allowed.\n- ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> allowed.\n\nBut we also want to cover more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we know R is in the word, and we have to place it not in position 2, we can try position 1.\n\nLet me try to form a word with R at the start and without the forbidden letters.\n\nR at position 1: \n- R _ _ _ _\n\nWe need to fill the rest with letters not in {A, I, S, E} and that form a valid word.\n\nPossible: \n- ROCKY (R, O, C, K, Y) -> but K and Y are less common? \n- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) -> good, common letters.\n\nBut note: we also want to test other common consonants. We haven\'t tried T, N, L, etc.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ROTUND"" is 6 letters, too long.\n\n""ROUND"" is 5 letters.\n\nBut we can also try R in position 3 or 4.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid putting R in position 1 because we don\'t know if it\'s there. We know it\'s not in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5.\n\nTo maximize information, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven\'t tested (like 1) and also introduces new common letters.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and use common letters we haven\'t tried: like T, N, O, U, L, D, etc.\n\nFor example: \n- ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> R is in position 4? But we don\'t know if R is in 4. Also, no A, I, S, E -> valid.\n- ""POUR"" is 4 letters, too short.\n- ""GROUP"" -> G, R, O, U, P -> R is in position 2? But we cannot put R in position 2 because we already know it\'s not there? Actually, we can put R in position 2 again? But we know it\'s not in position 2, so it would be a waste of a position because we know it will be marked as \'-\' again? Actually, we can, but it doesn\'t give new information about the position of R. So it\'s better to try R in a new position.\n\nSo, we should avoid position 2 for R.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess, we should place R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nLet me list some words:\n\n- R in position 1: ROUND, ROUTE (but E is out, so no), ROUTH (not common), ROUGH (U, G, H -> allowed), ROOMY (O, M, Y -> allowed, but two O\'s?).\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has O or U.\n\nAnother: ""ROUGH"" -> R, O, U, G, H -> all allowed.\n\n- R in position 3: We can try a word like ... R ... For example: ""CARRY"" -> but A is out, so no. ""BORED"" -> E is out. ""FURRY"" -> U, R, R, Y -> but we have two R\'s? The secret word might have two R\'s? We don\'t know. But we only know one R is present so far. But it could have two.\n\nBut we have to avoid A, I, S, E.\n\n""BURLY"" -> B, U, R, L, Y -> allowed. R is in position 3.\n\n- R in position 4: ""HORDE"" -> E is out. ""FORUM"" -> F, O, R, U, M -> allowed. R is in position 3? Let\'s count: F(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), M(5) -> so R is in position 3, not 4.\n\nTo have R in position 4: ""STARE"" -> but S and E are out. ""CHORE"" -> E out. ""LYRE"" is 4 letters. ""PURTY"" not a word. ""CURED"" -> E out. ""GOURD"" -> G, O, U, R, D -> R is in position 4? G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5) -> yes. And no A, I, S, E -> allowed.\n\n- R in position 5: ""LATER"" -> E out. ""RUMOR"" -> R is in position 1 and 5? But we can use: ""RUMOR"" has R at 1 and 5, but we don\'t know if we can have two R\'s. Also, U, M, O -> allowed? But we have two R\'s. Alternatively, ""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> R at the end. Allowed.\n\nBut we want to cover more ground. We have only one known letter (R) and we know it\'s not in position 2.\n\nI think a good strategy is to try R in a new position and also test other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (like T, N, L, etc.).\n\nOne classic second guess after ""ARISE"" with this feedback might be to try a word like ""ROUND"" or ""POUND"" (but POUND has no R). We need R.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""ROUND"": \n- R in position 1 (which is new, we haven\'t tested position 1 for R)\n- O, U, N, D are new letters.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has O, U, N, D, but we are testing them.\n\nAnother candidate: ""COURT"" has R in position 3? C(1), O(2), U(3), R(4)? Wait, no: COURT is C-O-U-R-T, so positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:T -> so R is in position 4. And we haven\'t tested position 4 for R.\n\nAlso, COURT uses C, O, U, R, T -> all new letters (except R) and common.\n\nBut we don\'t have E, so it\'s valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""GROUP"": G(1), R(2), O(3), U(4), P(5) -> but R is in position 2, which we already know is wrong. So we would get \'-\' for R again, and we already know that. So it\'s better to avoid position 2 for R.\n\nTherefore, avoid words with R in position 2.\n\nSo, ""COURT"" is good: R in position 4.\n\nAnother option: ""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> R in position 2? B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> position 2, which we want to avoid.\n\nSo not that.\n\n""THORN"" -> T, H, O, R, N -> R in position 4? T(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> yes. And no A, I, S, E -> allowed.\n\nBut we also want to test U? Not necessarily.\n\nI think ""COURT"" is a good choice because it tests C, O, U, T and R in a new position (4).\n\nAlternatively, ""ROUND"" tests R, O, U, N, D with R in position 1.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nBut note: we have only one R, and we are testing it in a new position.\n\nI\'ll go with ""ROUND"" because it tests R at position 1 and also includes common letters.\n\nBut let me check if ""ROUND"" is a valid word: yes.\n\nSo, my second guess: ROUND.\n\nBut wait, what if the secret word has R in position 1? Then we get a check. If not, we might get a minus for R and also learn about O, U, N, D.\n\nAlternatively, if we use ""COURT"", we test R in position 4.\n\nSince we don\'t have any information about position 1, it might be good to test R there.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nI\'ll choose ""ROUND"".\n\nBut let me see: after ""arise"" with R being misplaced, and we know it\'s not in position 2, if we put R in position 1 and it\'s correct, that would be great. If not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""ROUND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""arise"":\n- A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word (marked with \'x\').\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (marked with \'-\').\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include R (in a position other than 2) and exclude A, I, S, E.\n- To maximize information, I chose a word with R in position 1 (a new position to test) and introduced new common letters: O, U, N, D.\n- ""round"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits these criteria and helps test for other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (N, D).\n\n<guess>round</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: round -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess ""arise"":\n  A: x (not in word)\n  R: - (in word, but wrong position; so R is not in position 2)\n  I: x (not in word)\n  S: x (not in word)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nSecond guess ""round"":\n  R: - (in word, wrong position; so R is not in position 1 either, because we tried position 1 now and got \'-\')\n  O: x (not in word)\n  U: - (in word, wrong position; so U is in the word but not in position 3)\n  N: x (not in word)\n  D: x (not in word)\n\nNow, we know:\n\nLetters not in the word: A, I, S, E, O, N, D\n\nLetters in the word: R and U\n\nWe also know the positions for R: it cannot be in position 1 (from ""round"") or position 2 (from ""arise""). So it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, U is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""round"").\n\nWe have used two guesses. We have four more.\n\nWe need to form a new 5-letter word that:\n- Contains R (in position 3, 4, or 5)\n- Contains U (not in position 3)\n- Does not contain A, I, S, E, O, N, D\n\nAdditionally, we can use other letters that haven\'t been tried yet.\n\nThe remaining letters (not tried and not excluded) are: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe want to maximize information by covering new letters and different positions.\n\nAlso, we need to consider the positions for R and U.\n\nSince R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and U must not be in 3, so U can be in 1,2,4,5. But note: we don\'t know the secret word, so U could be in any position but 3.\n\nWe can try to place R in one of the possible positions and U in another.\n\nLet\'s list possible positions:\n\nFor R: 3,4,5\nFor U: 1,2,4,5\n\nBut note: if we put R and U in the same position? No, they are different letters.\n\nWe must avoid positions that we already know are wrong for these letters.\n\nWe haven\'t tested positions 4 and 5 for U, and positions 3,4,5 for R.\n\nPossible words:\n\nWe need a word that has R in 3,4, or 5 and U somewhere else.\n\nSince we don\'t know where U is, we can try to put U in a position we haven\'t tested. We have tested U in position 3 (got \'-\') and R in position 1 (got \'-\') and 2 (we didn\'t try? Wait, in ""arise"" R was in position 2 and got \'-\', so we know R is not in position 2). For U, only position 3 has been tried.\n\nSo we can try U in position 1,2,4,5.\n\nSimilarly for R, we have tried position 1 (in ""round"") and position 2 (in ""arise"") and both were \'-\', so R must be in 3,4, or 5.\n\nLet us try to formulate words without the excluded letters and with R and U.\n\nExcluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D\n\nAvailable: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe also want common words to maximize the chance.\n\nTry words with U and R.\n\nPossible common letters: T, L, M, P, etc.\n\nWords:\n\n- If U is at position 1: then U _ _ R_ ? But we need to fill.\n\n  U in 1, R in 4? Example: ""ULCER"" but E is excluded. ""ULTRA"" but A is excluded.\n\n  ""ULTRA"" has A, which is out. No.\n\n  ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E is excluded. No.\n\n  ""UMPTY"" not a word.\n\n  ""UNCUT"" has N and C? U, N, C, U, T? Wait, ""UNCUT"" has N (excluded) and U twice? Also N is excluded.\n\n  We cannot use N.\n\n  So, U in position 1: hard to find without excluded letters.\n\n  Example: ""UPTURN"" too long.\n\n  ""UTILE"" has E and I? U, T, I, L, E -> I and E excluded.\n\n  Maybe ""UGLY"" too short?\n\n  Let me think of common words: ""USURY"" has S? U, S, U, R, Y -> S is excluded.\n\n  ""USURP"" -> U, S, U, R, P -> S excluded.\n\n  Difficult with U at start.\n\n- U at position 2: _ U _ _ _\n\n  Then with R in position 3,4, or 5.\n\n  Example: if R in 4: _ U _ R _\n\n  Words: ""CURLY"" -> C, U, R, L, Y? But R is in position 3? Because C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5). But we want R in 4? Here R is in 3.\n\n  We can have R in 3: so _ U R _ _\n\n  Examples: ""BURMA"" but A excluded. ""BURQA"" not common. ""BURST"" has S excluded.\n\n  ""CURVE"" -> C, U, R, V, E -> E excluded.\n\n  ""CURVY"" -> C, U, R, V, Y -> and V and Y are allowed. But R is in position 3.\n\n  But does it have excluded? Letters: C,U,R,V,Y -> no A,I,S,E,O,N,D -> acceptable.\n\n  Also, it tests C, V, Y.\n\n  Another: ""FURRY"" has two R\'s? F,U,R,R,Y -> but we don\'t know if R can be duplicated. But it might, so let\'s consider. However, we have R only once so far, but the secret word might have two R\'s? Yes, possible.\n\n  But in ""curvy"", R is in position 3.\n\n  Alternatively, if R in position 4: so _ U ? R _\n\n  For example, ""GOURD"" but O excluded because in ""round"" O is x, so O not present.\n\n  O is excluded? Yes, from ""round"": O(x), so O is not in the word.\n\n  Similarly, in ""round"", O was guessed and marked x, so O is not in the word.\n\n  So we must avoid O.\n\n  ""GOURD"" has O? G,O,U,R,D -> O and D excluded.\n\n  No.\n\n  So for _ U _ R _, let\'s make a word: like ""PUTTY"" has U? P,U,T,T,Y -> but T,T. And R is missing? We need to have R.\n\n  We need R in the word.\n\n  So for U in 2, R in 4: we have pattern _ U ? R ? \n\n  Words: ""CURRY"" has R in 3 and 4? C,U,R,R,Y -> but position 3 is R and position 4 is R? Specifically: position 4 is R? No: C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) so yes R at position 4? Actually, the fourth letter is R. But we also have R at position 3? So ""CURRY"" has R at positions 3 and 4? It depends on the word.\n\n  But we need only one R? Not necessarily.\n\n  However, we know that R is present at least once. But it could be twice.\n\n  But if we use two R\'s, we might get confused.\n\n  Better to choose a word with U and R only once to avoid ambiguity.\n\n  So, let\'s avoid duplicate letters for now.\n\n  So, _ U ? R _ ? With no duplicates and no excluded letters.\n\n  Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\n  Suppose U in 2, R in 4: then positions:\n  1: one of B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z\n  2: U\n  3: one of the available letters\n  4: R\n  5: one of the available letters\n\n  Examples: \n  ""CURRY"" has two R\'s.\n  ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> letters: M,U,R,K,Y -> all allowed? M, U, R, K, Y -> and no excluded? Yes. But R is in position 3? M(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). So R is in 3, not 4.\n\n  If we want R in 4: so the letter in position 4 is R. So the letter after U must be the fourth? That is position 4.\n\n  So the pattern: position 1: ?, 2: U, 3: some letter, 4: R, 5: ?\n\n  Words: ""CURRY"" would have position 4 as R? In ""curry"": C(1),U(2),R(3),R(4) – wait, actually it\'s C(1),U(2),R(3),R(4) so position 4 is R.\n\n  So ""CURRY"" works: U in 2 and R in 4? But in position 3 we also have R? So if the secret word has only one R, we might get multiple feedbacks.\n\n  Another word: ""SURFY"" but S is excluded. ""HURRY"" has H,U,R,R,Y -> R at position 3 and 4? Similarly.\n\n  ""LURCH"" -> L, U, R, C, H -> R is in position 3? L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)? Not 4.\n\n  ""BURET"" has E? B,U,R,E,T -> E excluded.\n\n  ""FUROR"" has O? F,U,R,O,R -> O excluded.\n\n  ""PURTY"" not a word.\n\n  ""MURTI"" not common.\n\n  How about ""CURVY"" but R is in 3.\n\n  Another word: ""BUYER"" has E? B,U,Y,E,R -> E excluded.\n\n  This is challenging.\n\n  Let\'s try U in position 4.\n\n  Or perhaps U in position 5.\n\nLet\'s try U in position 4: ... U\n\nPattern: ... U, so U in 4, and R in 3 or 5? Or in another position.\n\nPosition 4: U, then U cannot be in position 3 because we know U is not in 3, but 4 is fine.\n\nAlso R in 3,4,5? But if U in 4, and R in 4, same position? Not possible.\n\nSo R cannot be in 4 if U is there? But they are different letters.\n\nU in 4, R in 3 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, U in 5: R in 3,4.\n\nSo let\'s pattern U in 4:\n\n? ? ? U ?\n\nWith R somewhere.\n\nIf R in 3: ... then positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:R, 4:U, 5:?\n\nBut we need R in 3 and U in 4.\n\nWords: ""TRUTH"" has T,R,U,T,H -> R at 2? T(1),R(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> not matching pattern.\n\n""GRUMP"" -> G,R,U,M,P -> R in 2, U in 3? But U is in position 3, which we already know is not allowed for U (from ""round"", U was in position 3 and got \'-\')? No, wait: In ""round"", U was in position 3? Let me check ""round"": R(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> so U was in position 3 and got \'-\', meaning U is in the word but not in position 3. So we can try U in other positions, but not 3.\n\nSo for U in position 4: pattern _ _ R U ? or _ _ ? U R\n\nIf R in 3 and U in 4: then _ _ R U ?\n\nExample: ""CHRUT"" not a word. ""FRUMP"" -> F,R,U,M,P -> but U is in 3? F(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5) -> not U in 4.\n\n""TRUMUD"" too long.\n\n""TRUMP"" -> T,R,U,M,P -> U in 3? T(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5) -> U in pos 3, not 4.\n\nIt\'s hard.\n\nPerhaps U in position 5.\n\nPattern: ? ? ? ? U\n\nWith R in 3 or 4.\n\nFor example, R in 3: _ _ R ? U\n\nWords: ""CARBU"" not a word.\n\n""MARAU"" not a word.\n\nCommon word: ""THUMB"" but U is not at end. H is position? T,H,U,M,B -> U is 3.\n\n""VAGUER"" too long.\n\nPerhaps not common.\n\nSince U is a vowel and we have few vowels left we can try, but the word must have U.\n\nAnother idea: use U in position 2 and R in position 5.\n\nPattern: _ U _ _ R\n\nSo U in 2, R in 5.\n\nWords: ""QUOTER"" has O and E? Q,U,O,T,E,R -> O and E excluded.\n\n""JUMAR"" not common.\n\n""HUMIC"" not common.\n\n""LUMBRICAL"" too long.\n\n"" buy r"" not.\n\n""PURER"" has E? P,U,R,E,R -> E excluded.\n\n""PUFFR"" not a word.\n\n""CURVY"" is C,U,R,V,Y -> U in 2, R in 3, Y in 4? C(1),U(2),R(3),V(4),Y(5) so R in 3.\n\nBut we can accept R in 3.\n\nPerhaps ""curvy"" is a good option.\n\nSimilarly, ""BURMA"" has A but excluded.\n\nI think ""CURVY"" is a valid word and it uses common letters.\n\nIt has:\n- C: new\n- U: at position 2?

We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""arise"": A(x), R(-), I(x), S(x), E(x) → So R is in the word but not in position 2; A, I, S, E are not in the word.
2. ""round"": R(-), O(x), U(-), N(x), D(x) → So R is not in position 1 (since we got a minus), U is in the word but not in position 3; O, N, D are not in the word.
3. ""curvy"": C(x), U(✓), R(✓), V(x), Y(✓) → This gives us:
   - U is in the word and CORRECT position (position 3? Wait, let's see: in ""curvy"", the positions are: C(1), U(2), R(3), V(4), Y(5). So U is at position 2? But earlier feedback said U was not in position 3 from ""round"". But now U is at position 2 and got a check (✓), which means it is correct at position 2.

Correction: In ""curvy"":
- Position 1: C → x (not in word)
- Position 2: U → ✓ (correct letter and correct position)
- Position 3: R → ✓ (correct letter and correct position)
- Position 4: V → x (not in word)
- Position 5: Y → ✓ (correct letter and correct position)

Therefore, we know:
- U is in position 2, and it's correct.
- R is in position 3, and it's correct.
- Y is in position 5, and it's correct.
- C and V are not in the word.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we know:
- Excluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V (and others we found not present)
- Confirmed positions:
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: R
  Position 5: Y

So the secret word has the form: _ U R _ Y

We now need to find the first and fourth letters.

The missing positions: 1 and 4.

Letters we know:
- Must include U, R, Y (but already placed).
- We know the word has three letters fixed: U at 2, R at 3, Y at 5.
- The first and fourth positions need letters.

Excluded letters so far: from all feedbacks:
- Guess 1: A, I, S, E
- Guess 2: O, N, D
- Guess 3: C, V

So collectively excluded: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V

Therefore, available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z

But note: the word must be a 5-letter English word with pattern _ U R _ Y.

Possible words:
We need to try letters for position 1 and 4 from the available set.

Common words:
- BURPY? Not a word.
- PURPY? No.
- FURRY: F,U,R,R,Y? But Y is already at position 5? Pattern: F(1), U(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) → ""furry"" (which means covered with fur). Is it valid? But we have R at position 3 fixed, and if we put R at position 4, it might work. Also, check excluded: F and R? R is already used. Is R duplicated allowed? The secret word might have two R's? We know R is at position 3, but position 4 could be another R?

Feedback so far hasn't shown multiple R's, but it's possible.

Another word: ""HURRY"" which is similar: H,U,R,R,Y → same pattern H(1),U(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5).

But we don't know about duplicate letters.

Other possibilities without duplicates:
- ""LURGY""? Not a word.
- ""MURKY"" has K and Y? M,U,R,K,Y → but from guess 2, U was at position3? No, in this case: M(1),U(2),R(3),K(4),Y(5) → ""murky"". Valid? Yes. But we have to check if K is allowed? K is not excluded? Yes, available.

But in feedback from guess 2, we have U marked as '-' in position 3, but that doesn't affect K.

Similarly, ""TURFY""? Not common.

""JURY"" is 4 letters.

We need two letters: one for position 1 and one for position 4.

List words that fit _ U R _ Y:
- FURRY: F U R R Y
- HURRY: H U R R Y
- BURRY: B U R R Y? Not common, ""burry"" might be a variant but less common.
- CURRY: but C is excluded? Yes, guess3: C(x), so C not in word.
- PURRY? Not a word.
- SURRY? S excluded.
- LURRY? Not a word.
- MURKY: M U R K Y → valid word.
- GURRY? Not common.
- PURDY? P U R D Y → but D excluded? From guess2: D(x), so D not in word.
- TURFY: not standard.
- BURLY: B U R L Y → ""burly"" means strong. B(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5). Available letters: B and L not excluded.

Similarly, ""JUMBY""? Not fitting.

So possible words: 
- ""furry"" (if double R is allowed)
- ""hurry"" (double R)
- ""murky"" (no double)
- ""burly"" (no double)

We need to choose a guess that tests position 1 and 4.

We have guesses left: we have used 3, so 3 more tries.

We can try one of these words.

Let's pick one that uses common non-excluded letters.

We also want to maximize information, but since we have three positions only fixed and two to determine, we can guess a word that fits.

But note: if we guess a word with duplicate letters, and if it's wrong, we might not know about the fourth letter.

So perhaps a word without duplicate R is better to clarify the fourth position.

For example, ""burly"" would test B in position 1 and L in position 4.

Similarly, ""murky"" tests M and K.

Other words: ""turfy"" not common; ""purpy"" no.

How about ""jury"" is too short.

I think ""burly"" and ""murky"" are reasonable.

Another word: ""furzy"" not common.

""purty"" not standard.

I'll go with ""burly"" because B and L are common.

But we can also try ""murky"".

But let's see: the fourth letter could be R? As in ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

We don't know if the word has two R's.

To avoid duplication, let's try ""burly"".

So my guess: ""BURLY""

Feedback will tell us about B and L.

So, pattern is _ U R _ Y, with U,R,Y fixed.

We guess ""BURLY"".

If not, we have other options.

But let's do it.

### Previous Feedback Analysis:
1. **Guess 1: arise**  
   - A(x), R(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)  
   → R is in the word but not in position 2. A, I, S, E are eliminated.  
2. **Guess 2: round**  
   - R(-), O(x), U(-), N(x), D(x)  
   → R is not in position 1, U is in the word but not in position 3. O, N, D are eliminated.  
3. **Guess 3: curvy**  
   - C(x), U(✓), R(✓), V(x), Y(✓)  
   → U is correct at position 2, R is correct at position 3, Y is correct at position 5. C and V are eliminated.  

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed Letters/Positions:**  
  - Position 2: U (correct)  
  - Position 3: R (correct)  
  - Position 5: Y (correct)  
- **Secret Word Pattern:** `_ U R _ Y`  
- **Eliminated Letters:** A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V  
- **Available Letters:** B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z  

### Strategy for Fourth Guess:
- The goal is to solve for positions 1 and 4 of the pattern `_ U R _ Y`.  
- Choose a valid English word that fits this pattern, prioritizing common letters to test possibilities:  
  - Position 1: Test B, F, H, L, M, T (common options).  
  - Position 4: Test G, L, K, M, T (to cover both positions with minimal duplication).  
- ""Burly"" was selected:  
  - B (new) tests position 1.  
  - L (new) tests position 4.  
- If incorrect, feedback on B and L will directly reduce possibilities for positions 1 and 4.  
- Common words fitting the pattern (e.g., ""hurry"", ""murky"", ""turfy"") will be tested based on feedback.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Without any prior information, a good starting word is one that includes common letters and has a balanced letter distribution.
 Common starting words in Wordle often contain multiple vowels and common consonants. Examples: ""CRATE"", ""ROATE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ARISE"", etc.
 I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains A, R, I, S, E which are common letters.For the first guess, I chose ""ARISE"" because it includes common vowels (A, I, E) and frequent consonants (R, S), maximizing the chance to uncover overlaps with the secret word. This provides a solid baseline for deducing the word structure.

<guess>arise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""arise"":
- A: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since we placed it in the second position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains R (but not in position 2) and does not contain A, I, S, or E.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain A, I, S, E (since they are not in the word).
- Must contain R (and we know it's not in position 2, so we should place R in a different position: 1, 3, 4, or 5).

Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and covering different positions.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We should avoid using any of the discarded letters: A, I, S, E.

Let's think of words that include R (in a position other than 2) and use other common letters.

Possible positions for R: we can try putting R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

To get more information, we might want to try a word that has R in a different position and includes other common consonants and vowels (but note: we know the word doesn't have A, I, E, so the vowels must be from O, U, and sometimes Y).

But note: the word might have other vowels like O or U.

Let me list some candidate words:

- Starting with R: words like ""ROUND"", ""ROBOT"", ""ROAST"" (but A and S are out, so not these). We cannot use A, I, S, E.

So, words without A, I, S, E and with R.

Possible words: 
- ""ROUTE"" -> but E is out, so no.
- ""ROUND"" -> no A, I, S, E? R, O, U, N, D -> yes, all allowed.
- ""CRONY"" -> C, R, O, N, Y -> no A, I, S, E -> allowed.
- ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> allowed.

But we also want to cover more common letters.

Another idea: since we know R is in the word, and we have to place it not in position 2, we can try position 1.

Let me try to form a word with R at the start and without the forbidden letters.

R at position 1: 
- R _ _ _ _

We need to fill the rest with letters not in {A, I, S, E} and that form a valid word.

Possible: 
- ROCKY (R, O, C, K, Y) -> but K and Y are less common? 
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) -> good, common letters.

But note: we also want to test other common consonants. We haven't tried T, N, L, etc.

Another candidate: ""ROTUND"" is 6 letters, too long.

""ROUND"" is 5 letters.

But we can also try R in position 3 or 4.

Alternatively, we might avoid putting R in position 1 because we don't know if it's there. We know it's not in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5.

To maximize information, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven't tested (like 1) and also introduces new common letters.

Let me think of words that have R and use common letters we haven't tried: like T, N, O, U, L, D, etc.

For example: 
- ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> R is in position 4? But we don't know if R is in 4. Also, no A, I, S, E -> valid.
- ""POUR"" is 4 letters, too short.
- ""GROUP"" -> G, R, O, U, P -> R is in position 2? But we cannot put R in position 2 because we already know it's not there? Actually, we can put R in position 2 again? But we know it's not in position 2, so it would be a waste of a position because we know it will be marked as '-' again? Actually, we can, but it doesn't give new information about the position of R. So it's better to try R in a new position.

So, we should avoid position 2 for R.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should place R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me list some words:

- R in position 1: ROUND, ROUTE (but E is out, so no), ROUTH (not common), ROUGH (U, G, H -> allowed), ROOMY (O, M, Y -> allowed, but two O's?).

But we don't know if the word has O or U.

Another: ""ROUGH"" -> R, O, U, G, H -> all allowed.

- R in position 3: We can try a word like ... R ... For example: ""CARRY"" -> but A is out, so no. ""BORED"" -> E is out. ""FURRY"" -> U, R, R, Y -> but we have two R's? The secret word might have two R's? We don't know. But we only know one R is present so far. But it could have two.

But we have to avoid A, I, S, E.

""BURLY"" -> B, U, R, L, Y -> allowed. R is in position 3.

- R in position 4: ""HORDE"" -> E is out. ""FORUM"" -> F, O, R, U, M -> allowed. R is in position 3? Let's count: F(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), M(5) -> so R is in position 3, not 4.

To have R in position 4: ""STARE"" -> but S and E are out. ""CHORE"" -> E out. ""LYRE"" is 4 letters. ""PURTY"" not a word. ""CURED"" -> E out. ""GOURD"" -> G, O, U, R, D -> R is in position 4? G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5) -> yes. And no A, I, S, E -> allowed.

- R in position 5: ""LATER"" -> E out. ""RUMOR"" -> R is in position 1 and 5? But we can use: ""RUMOR"" has R at 1 and 5, but we don't know if we can have two R's. Also, U, M, O -> allowed? But we have two R's. Alternatively, ""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> R at the end. Allowed.

But we want to cover more ground. We have only one known letter (R) and we know it's not in position 2.

I think a good strategy is to try R in a new position and also test other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (like T, N, L, etc.).

One classic second guess after ""ARISE"" with this feedback might be to try a word like ""ROUND"" or ""POUND"" (but POUND has no R). We need R.

So, let's go with ""ROUND"": 
- R in position 1 (which is new, we haven't tested position 1 for R)
- O, U, N, D are new letters.

But note: we are not sure if the word has O, U, N, D, but we are testing them.

Another candidate: ""COURT"" has R in position 3? C(1), O(2), U(3), R(4)? Wait, no: COURT is C-O-U-R-T, so positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:T -> so R is in position 4. And we haven't tested position 4 for R.

Also, COURT uses C, O, U, R, T -> all new letters (except R) and common.

But we don't have E, so it's valid.

Similarly, ""GROUP"": G(1), R(2), O(3), U(4), P(5) -> but R is in position 2, which we already know is wrong. So we would get '-' for R again, and we already know that. So it's better to avoid position 2 for R.

Therefore, avoid words with R in position 2.

So, ""COURT"" is good: R in position 4.

Another option: ""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> R in position 2? B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> position 2, which we want to avoid.

So not that.

""THORN"" -> T, H, O, R, N -> R in position 4? T(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> yes. And no A, I, S, E -> allowed.

But we also want to test U? Not necessarily.

I think ""COURT"" is a good choice because it tests C, O, U, T and R in a new position (4).

Alternatively, ""ROUND"" tests R, O, U, N, D with R in position 1.

Both are good.

But note: we have only one R, and we are testing it in a new position.

I'll go with ""ROUND"" because it tests R at position 1 and also includes common letters.

But let me check if ""ROUND"" is a valid word: yes.

So, my second guess: ROUND.

But wait, what if the secret word has R in position 1? Then we get a check. If not, we might get a minus for R and also learn about O, U, N, D.

Alternatively, if we use ""COURT"", we test R in position 4.

Since we don't have any information about position 1, it might be good to test R there.

I think either is fine.

I'll choose ""ROUND"".

But let me see: after ""arise"" with R being misplaced, and we know it's not in position 2, if we put R in position 1 and it's correct, that would be great. If not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.

So, I'll go with ""ROUND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""arise"":
- A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word (marked with 'x').
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (marked with '-').

For the second guess:
- The word must include R (in a position other than 2) and exclude A, I, S, E.
- To maximize information, I chose a word with R in position 1 (a new position to test) and introduced new common letters: O, U, N, D.
- ""round"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits these criteria and helps test for other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (N, D).

<guess>round</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: round -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess ""arise"":
  A: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, but wrong position; so R is not in position 2)
  I: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Second guess ""round"":
  R: - (in word, wrong position; so R is not in position 1 either, because we tried position 1 now and got '-')
  O: x (not in word)
  U: - (in word, wrong position; so U is in the word but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  D: x (not in word)

Now, we know:

Letters not in the word: A, I, S, E, O, N, D

Letters in the word: R and U

We also know the positions for R: it cannot be in position 1 (from ""round"") or position 2 (from ""arise""). So it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, U is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""round"").

We have used two guesses. We have four more.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R (in position 3, 4, or 5)
- Contains U (not in position 3)
- Does not contain A, I, S, E, O, N, D

Additionally, we can use other letters that haven't been tried yet.

The remaining letters (not tried and not excluded) are: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want to maximize information by covering new letters and different positions.

Also, we need to consider the positions for R and U.

Since R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and U must not be in 3, so U can be in 1,2,4,5. But note: we don't know the secret word, so U could be in any position but 3.

We can try to place R in one of the possible positions and U in another.

Let's list possible positions:

For R: 3,4,5
For U: 1,2,4,5

But note: if we put R and U in the same position? No, they are different letters.

We must avoid positions that we already know are wrong for these letters.

We haven't tested positions 4 and 5 for U, and positions 3,4,5 for R.

Possible words:

We need a word that has R in 3,4, or 5 and U somewhere else.

Since we don't know where U is, we can try to put U in a position we haven't tested. We have tested U in position 3 (got '-') and R in position 1 (got '-') and 2 (we didn't try? Wait, in ""arise"" R was in position 2 and got '-', so we know R is not in position 2). For U, only position 3 has been tried.

So we can try U in position 1,2,4,5.

Similarly for R, we have tried position 1 (in ""round"") and position 2 (in ""arise"") and both were '-', so R must be in 3,4, or 5.

Let us try to formulate words without the excluded letters and with R and U.

Excluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D

Available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also want common words to maximize the chance.

Try words with U and R.

Possible common letters: T, L, M, P, etc.

Words:

- If U is at position 1: then U _ _ R_ ? But we need to fill.

  U in 1, R in 4? Example: ""ULCER"" but E is excluded. ""ULTRA"" but A is excluded.

  ""ULTRA"" has A, which is out. No.

  ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E is excluded. No.

  ""UMPTY"" not a word.

  ""UNCUT"" has N and C? U, N, C, U, T? Wait, ""UNCUT"" has N (excluded) and U twice? Also N is excluded.

  We cannot use N.

  So, U in position 1: hard to find without excluded letters.

  Example: ""UPTURN"" too long.

  ""UTILE"" has E and I? U, T, I, L, E -> I and E excluded.

  Maybe ""UGLY"" too short?

  Let me think of common words: ""USURY"" has S? U, S, U, R, Y -> S is excluded.

  ""USURP"" -> U, S, U, R, P -> S excluded.

  Difficult with U at start.

- U at position 2: _ U _ _ _

  Then with R in position 3,4, or 5.

  Example: if R in 4: _ U _ R _

  Words: ""CURLY"" -> C, U, R, L, Y? But R is in position 3? Because C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5). But we want R in 4? Here R is in 3.

  We can have R in 3: so _ U R _ _

  Examples: ""BURMA"" but A excluded. ""BURQA"" not common. ""BURST"" has S excluded.

  ""CURVE"" -> C, U, R, V, E -> E excluded.

  ""CURVY"" -> C, U, R, V, Y -> and V and Y are allowed. But R is in position 3.

  But does it have excluded? Letters: C,U,R,V,Y -> no A,I,S,E,O,N,D -> acceptable.

  Also, it tests C, V, Y.

  Another: ""FURRY"" has two R's? F,U,R,R,Y -> but we don't know if R can be duplicated. But it might, so let's consider. However, we have R only once so far, but the secret word might have two R's? Yes, possible.

  But in ""curvy"", R is in position 3.

  Alternatively, if R in position 4: so _ U ? R _

  For example, ""GOURD"" but O excluded because in ""round"" O is x, so O not present.

  O is excluded? Yes, from ""round"": O(x), so O is not in the word.

  Similarly, in ""round"", O was guessed and marked x, so O is not in the word.

  So we must avoid O.

  ""GOURD"" has O? G,O,U,R,D -> O and D excluded.

  No.

  So for _ U _ R _, let's make a word: like ""PUTTY"" has U? P,U,T,T,Y -> but T,T. And R is missing? We need to have R.

  We need R in the word.

  So for U in 2, R in 4: we have pattern _ U ? R ? 

  Words: ""CURRY"" has R in 3 and 4? C,U,R,R,Y -> but position 3 is R and position 4 is R? Specifically: position 4 is R? No: C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) so yes R at position 4? Actually, the fourth letter is R. But we also have R at position 3? So ""CURRY"" has R at positions 3 and 4? It depends on the word.

  But we need only one R? Not necessarily.

  However, we know that R is present at least once. But it could be twice.

  But if we use two R's, we might get confused.

  Better to choose a word with U and R only once to avoid ambiguity.

  So, let's avoid duplicate letters for now.

  So, _ U ? R _ ? With no duplicates and no excluded letters.

  Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

  Suppose U in 2, R in 4: then positions:
  1: one of B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z
  2: U
  3: one of the available letters
  4: R
  5: one of the available letters

  Examples: 
  ""CURRY"" has two R's.
  ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> letters: M,U,R,K,Y -> all allowed? M, U, R, K, Y -> and no excluded? Yes. But R is in position 3? M(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). So R is in 3, not 4.

  If we want R in 4: so the letter in position 4 is R. So the letter after U must be the fourth? That is position 4.

  So the pattern: position 1: ?, 2: U, 3: some letter, 4: R, 5: ?

  Words: ""CURRY"" would have position 4 as R? In ""curry"": C(1),U(2),R(3),R(4) – wait, actually it's C(1),U(2),R(3),R(4) so position 4 is R.

  So ""CURRY"" works: U in 2 and R in 4? But in position 3 we also have R? So if the secret word has only one R, we might get multiple feedbacks.

  Another word: ""SURFY"" but S is excluded. ""HURRY"" has H,U,R,R,Y -> R at position 3 and 4? Similarly.

  ""LURCH"" -> L, U, R, C, H -> R is in position 3? L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)? Not 4.

  ""BURET"" has E? B,U,R,E,T -> E excluded.

  ""FUROR"" has O? F,U,R,O,R -> O excluded.

  ""PURTY"" not a word.

  ""MURTI"" not common.

  How about ""CURVY"" but R is in 3.

  Another word: ""BUYER"" has E? B,U,Y,E,R -> E excluded.

  This is challenging.

  Let's try U in position 4.

  Or perhaps U in position 5.

Let's try U in position 4: ... U

Pattern: ... U, so U in 4, and R in 3 or 5? Or in another position.

Position 4: U, then U cannot be in position 3 because we know U is not in 3, but 4 is fine.

Also R in 3,4,5? But if U in 4, and R in 4, same position? Not possible.

So R cannot be in 4 if U is there? But they are different letters.

U in 4, R in 3 or 5.

Similarly, U in 5: R in 3,4.

So let's pattern U in 4:

? ? ? U ?

With R somewhere.

If R in 3: ... then positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:R, 4:U, 5:?

But we need R in 3 and U in 4.

Words: ""TRUTH"" has T,R,U,T,H -> R at 2? T(1),R(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> not matching pattern.

""GRUMP"" -> G,R,U,M,P -> R in 2, U in 3? But U is in position 3, which we already know is not allowed for U (from ""round"", U was in position 3 and got '-')? No, wait: In ""round"", U was in position 3? Let me check ""round"": R(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> so U was in position 3 and got '-', meaning U is in the word but not in position 3. So we can try U in other positions, but not 3.

So for U in position 4: pattern _ _ R U ? or _ _ ? U R

If R in 3 and U in 4: then _ _ R U ?

Example: ""CHRUT"" not a word. ""FRUMP"" -> F,R,U,M,P -> but U is in 3? F(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5) -> not U in 4.

""TRUMUD"" too long.

""TRUMP"" -> T,R,U,M,P -> U in 3? T(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5) -> U in pos 3, not 4.

It's hard.

Perhaps U in position 5.

Pattern: ? ? ? ? U

With R in 3 or 4.

For example, R in 3: _ _ R ? U

Words: ""CARBU"" not a word.

""MARAU"" not a word.

Common word: ""THUMB"" but U is not at end. H is position? T,H,U,M,B -> U is 3.

""VAGUER"" too long.

Perhaps not common.

Since U is a vowel and we have few vowels left we can try, but the word must have U.

Another idea: use U in position 2 and R in position 5.

Pattern: _ U _ _ R

So U in 2, R in 5.

Words: ""QUOTER"" has O and E? Q,U,O,T,E,R -> O and E excluded.

""JUMAR"" not common.

""HUMIC"" not common.

""LUMBRICAL"" too long.

"" buy r"" not.

""PURER"" has E? P,U,R,E,R -> E excluded.

""PUFFR"" not a word.

""CURVY"" is C,U,R,V,Y -> U in 2, R in 3, Y in 4? C(1),U(2),R(3),V(4),Y(5) so R in 3.

But we can accept R in 3.

Perhaps ""curvy"" is a good option.

Similarly, ""BURMA"" has A but excluded.

I think ""CURVY"" is a valid word and it uses common letters.

It has:
- C: new
- U: at position 2? But in ""CURVY"", U is in position 2, which hasn't been tested yet.
- R: in position 3, which is a possible location for R.
- V: new
- Y: new

Also, avoids all excluded letters.

But what about U in position 2? We don't know if it is valid or not, but we are testing it.

Since we know U is not in position 3, but position 2 could be.

R in position 3 could be correct.

So ""curvy"" seems okay.

Another word: ""TRYST"" but no U.

We must include U and R.

""GLYPH"" no U.

I think ""curvy"" is fine.

But let's confirm the letters: C, U, R, V, Y -> all not excluded.

So let's go with ""CURVY"".

But in the pattern, U is in positions 2 and R in 3.

We haven't tested position 2 for U, so it might be correct or wrong.

If U is not in position 2, we'll get a '-' if it's elsewhere or 'x' if not present? But we know U is present, so if not in 2, we'll get '-' again.

Similarly for R, if in 3, we might get a check or minus.

Another possibility: ""HUMOR"" has O, excluded.

""LYTUR"" not a word.

So ""CURVY"" is acceptable.

Therefore, I'll guess ""CURVY"".Based on the feedback:

- Excluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D
- Must include: R and U
- R positions: must be in 3,4, or 5 (cannot be in 1 or 2 per previous guesses)
- U was tested in position 3 and was wrong, so must be in 1,2,4,5

Chose ""CURVY"": 
- Places R in position 3 to test if it is correct there
- Places U in position 2, a new position to test
- Introduces new common letters: C, V, Y
- Word is valid and avoids all excluded letters

<guess>curvy</guess>After the first guess ""arise"" revealed that R is in the word but not in position 2, and A, I, S, E are not in the word, the second guess ""round"" provided additional feedback: R is not in position 1, O is not in the word, U is in the word but not in position 3, and N and D are not in the word.

### Current Deductions:
1. **Excluded Letters**: A, I, S, E, O, N, D (from 'x' feedback).
2. **Confirmed Letters**: R and U must be in the word.
   - R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (must be in 3, 4, or 5).
   - U cannot be in position 3 (must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5).
3. **Available Letters**: All unused consonants and vowels: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- The word must include R (in position 3, 4, or 5) and U (in position 1, 2, 4, or 5), and exclude all eliminated letters.
- Prioritize testing R in a new, untested position (e.g., position 3) to narrow its location, as positions 1 and 2 are ruled out.
- Test U in a new position (e.g., position 2) since position 3 is invalid and position 1 hasn't been tested.
- Introduce new common letters like C, V, and Y to maximize information if they are incorrect or reveal positions.
- Avoid reused positions for R and U where possible to gain new data.
- ""Curvy"" fits these criteria:
  - U in position 2 (previously untested for U) to check if correct or misplaced.
  - R in position 3 (a potential valid position) to test for correctness.
  - Uses C, V, and Y, which are common and untested.
  - Valid word with no excluded letters.

This guess efficiently covers two possible positions for U and R while introducing three new letters to accelerate process of elimination.

<guess>curvy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: round -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: curvy -> FEEDBACK: C(x) U(✓) R(✓) V(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""arise"": A(x), R(-), I(x), S(x), E(x) → So R is in the word but not in position 2; A, I, S, E are not in the word.
2. ""round"": R(-), O(x), U(-), N(x), D(x) → So R is not in position 1 (since we got a minus), U is in the word but not in position 3; O, N, D are not in the word.
3. ""curvy"": C(x), U(✓), R(✓), V(x), Y(✓) → This gives us:
   - U is in the word and CORRECT position (position 3? Wait, let's see: in ""curvy"", the positions are: C(1), U(2), R(3), V(4), Y(5). So U is at position 2? But earlier feedback said U was not in position 3 from ""round"". But now U is at position 2 and got a check (✓), which means it is correct at position 2.

Correction: In ""curvy"":
- Position 1: C → x (not in word)
- Position 2: U → ✓ (correct letter and correct position)
- Position 3: R → ✓ (correct letter and correct position)
- Position 4: V → x (not in word)
- Position 5: Y → ✓ (correct letter and correct position)

Therefore, we know:
- U is in position 2, and it's correct.
- R is in position 3, and it's correct.
- Y is in position 5, and it's correct.
- C and V are not in the word.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we know:
- Excluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V (and others we found not present)
- Confirmed positions:
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: R
  Position 5: Y

So the secret word has the form: _ U R _ Y

We now need to find the first and fourth letters.

The missing positions: 1 and 4.

Letters we know:
- Must include U, R, Y (but already placed).
- We know the word has three letters fixed: U at 2, R at 3, Y at 5.
- The first and fourth positions need letters.

Excluded letters so far: from all feedbacks:
- Guess 1: A, I, S, E
- Guess 2: O, N, D
- Guess 3: C, V

So collectively excluded: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V

Therefore, available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z

But note: the word must be a 5-letter English word with pattern _ U R _ Y.

Possible words:
We need to try letters for position 1 and 4 from the available set.

Common words:
- BURPY? Not a word.
- PURPY? No.
- FURRY: F,U,R,R,Y? But Y is already at position 5? Pattern: F(1), U(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) → ""furry"" (which means covered with fur). Is it valid? But we have R at position 3 fixed, and if we put R at position 4, it might work. Also, check excluded: F and R? R is already used. Is R duplicated allowed? The secret word might have two R's? We know R is at position 3, but position 4 could be another R?

Feedback so far hasn't shown multiple R's, but it's possible.

Another word: ""HURRY"" which is similar: H,U,R,R,Y → same pattern H(1),U(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5).

But we don't know about duplicate letters.

Other possibilities without duplicates:
- ""LURGY""? Not a word.
- ""MURKY"" has K and Y? M,U,R,K,Y → but from guess 2, U was at position3? No, in this case: M(1),U(2),R(3),K(4),Y(5) → ""murky"". Valid? Yes. But we have to check if K is allowed? K is not excluded? Yes, available.

But in feedback from guess 2, we have U marked as '-' in position 3, but that doesn't affect K.

Similarly, ""TURFY""? Not common.

""JURY"" is 4 letters.

We need two letters: one for position 1 and one for position 4.

List words that fit _ U R _ Y:
- FURRY: F U R R Y
- HURRY: H U R R Y
- BURRY: B U R R Y? Not common, ""burry"" might be a variant but less common.
- CURRY: but C is excluded? Yes, guess3: C(x), so C not in word.
- PURRY? Not a word.
- SURRY? S excluded.
- LURRY? Not a word.
- MURKY: M U R K Y → valid word.
- GURRY? Not common.
- PURDY? P U R D Y → but D excluded? From guess2: D(x), so D not in word.
- TURFY: not standard.
- BURLY: B U R L Y → ""burly"" means strong. B(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5). Available letters: B and L not excluded.

Similarly, ""JUMBY""? Not fitting.

So possible words: 
- ""furry"" (if double R is allowed)
- ""hurry"" (double R)
- ""murky"" (no double)
- ""burly"" (no double)

We need to choose a guess that tests position 1 and 4.

We have guesses left: we have used 3, so 3 more tries.

We can try one of these words.

Let's pick one that uses common non-excluded letters.

We also want to maximize information, but since we have three positions only fixed and two to determine, we can guess a word that fits.

But note: if we guess a word with duplicate letters, and if it's wrong, we might not know about the fourth letter.

So perhaps a word without duplicate R is better to clarify the fourth position.

For example, ""burly"" would test B in position 1 and L in position 4.

Similarly, ""murky"" tests M and K.

Other words: ""turfy"" not common; ""purpy"" no.

How about ""jury"" is too short.

I think ""burly"" and ""murky"" are reasonable.

Another word: ""furzy"" not common.

""purty"" not standard.

I'll go with ""burly"" because B and L are common.

But we can also try ""murky"".

But let's see: the fourth letter could be R? As in ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

We don't know if the word has two R's.

To avoid duplication, let's try ""burly"".

So my guess: ""BURLY""

Feedback will tell us about B and L.

So, pattern is _ U R _ Y, with U,R,Y fixed.

We guess ""BURLY"".

If not, we have other options.

But let's do it.### Previous Feedback Analysis:
1. **Guess 1: arise**  
   - A(x), R(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)  
   → R is in the word but not in position 2. A, I, S, E are eliminated.  
2. **Guess 2: round**  
   - R(-), O(x), U(-), N(x), D(x)  
   → R is not in position 1, U is in the word but not in position 3. O, N, D are eliminated.  
3. **Guess 3: curvy**  
   - C(x), U(✓), R(✓), V(x), Y(✓)  
   → U is correct at position 2, R is correct at position 3, Y is correct at position 5. C and V are eliminated.  

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed Letters/Positions:**  
  - Position 2: U (correct)  
  - Position 3: R (correct)  
  - Position 5: Y (correct)  
- **Secret Word Pattern:** `_ U R _ Y`  
- **Eliminated Letters:** A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V  
- **Available Letters:** B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z  

### Strategy for Fourth Guess:
- The goal is to solve for positions 1 and 4 of the pattern `_ U R _ Y`.  
- Choose a valid English word that fits this pattern, prioritizing common letters to test possibilities:  
  - Position 1: Test B, F, H, L, M, T (common options).  
  - Position 4: Test G, L, K, M, T (to cover both positions with minimal duplication).  
- ""Burly"" was selected:  
  - B (new) tests position 1.  
  - L (new) tests position 4.  
- If incorrect, feedback on B and L will directly reduce possibilities for positions 1 and 4.  
- Common words fitting the pattern (e.g., ""hurry"", ""murky"", ""turfy"") will be tested based on feedback.

We cannot use A, I, S, E.\n\nSo, words without A, I, S, E and with R.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""ROUTE"" -> but E is out, so no.\n- ""ROUND"" -> no A, I, S, E? R, O, U, N, D -> yes, all allowed.\n- ""CRONY"" -> C, R, O, N, Y -> no A, I, S, E -> allowed.\n- ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> allowed.\n\nBut we also want to cover more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we know R is in the word, and we have to place it not in position 2, we can try position 1.\n\nLet me try to form a word with R at the start and without the forbidden letters.\n\nR at position 1: \n- R _ _ _ _\n\nWe need to fill the rest with letters not in {A, I, S, E} and that form a valid word.\n\nPossible: \n- ROCKY (R, O, C, K, Y) -> but K and Y are less common? \n- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) -> good, common letters.\n\nBut note: we also want to test other common consonants. We haven\'t tried T, N, L, etc.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ROTUND"" is 6 letters, too long.\n\n""ROUND"" is 5 letters.\n\nBut we can also try R in position 3 or 4.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid putting R in position 1 because we don\'t know if it\'s there. We know it\'s not in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5.\n\nTo maximize information, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven\'t tested (like 1) and also introduces new common letters.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and use common letters we haven\'t tried: like T, N, O, U, L, D, etc.\n\nFor example: \n- ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> R is in position 4? But we don\'t know if R is in 4. Also, no A, I, S, E -> valid.\n- ""POUR"" is 4 letters, too short.\n- ""GROUP"" -> G, R, O, U, P -> R is in position 2? But we cannot put R in position 2 because we already know it\'s not there? Actually, we can put R in position 2 again? But we know it\'s not in position 2, so it would be a waste of a position because we know it will be marked as \'-\' again? Actually, we can, but it doesn\'t give new information about the position of R. So it\'s better to try R in a new position.\n\nSo, we should avoid position 2 for R.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess, we should place R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nLet me list some words:\n\n- R in position 1: ROUND, ROUTE (but E is out, so no), ROUTH (not common), ROUGH (U, G, H -> allowed), ROOMY (O, M, Y -> allowed, but two O\'s?).\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has O or U.\n\nAnother: ""ROUGH"" -> R, O, U, G, H -> all allowed.\n\n- R in position 3: We can try a word like ... R ... For example: ""CARRY"" -> but A is out, so no. ""BORED"" -> E is out. ""FURRY"" -> U, R, R, Y -> but we have two R\'s? The secret word might have two R\'s? We don\'t know. But we only know one R is present so far. But it could have two.\n\nBut we have to avoid A, I, S, E.\n\n""BURLY"" -> B, U, R, L, Y -> allowed. R is in position 3.\n\n- R in position 4: ""HORDE"" -> E is out. ""FORUM"" -> F, O, R, U, M -> allowed. R is in position 3? Let\'s count: F(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), M(5) -> so R is in position 3, not 4.\n\nTo have R in position 4: ""STARE"" -> but S and E are out. ""CHORE"" -> E out. ""LYRE"" is 4 letters. ""PURTY"" not a word. ""CURED"" -> E out. ""GOURD"" -> G, O, U, R, D -> R is in position 4? G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5) -> yes. And no A, I, S, E -> allowed.\n\n- R in position 5: ""LATER"" -> E out. ""RUMOR"" -> R is in position 1 and 5? But we can use: ""RUMOR"" has R at 1 and 5, but we don\'t know if we can have two R\'s. Also, U, M, O -> allowed? But we have two R\'s. Alternatively, ""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> R at the end. Allowed.\n\nBut we want to cover more ground. We have only one known letter (R) and we know it\'s not in position 2.\n\nI think a good strategy is to try R in a new position and also test other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (like T, N, L, etc.).\n\nOne classic second guess after ""ARISE"" with this feedback might be to try a word like ""ROUND"" or ""POUND"" (but POUND has no R). We need R.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""ROUND"": \n- R in position 1 (which is new, we haven\'t tested position 1 for R)\n- O, U, N, D are new letters.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has O, U, N, D, but we are testing them.\n\nAnother candidate: ""COURT"" has R in position 3? C(1), O(2), U(3), R(4)? Wait, no: COURT is C-O-U-R-T, so positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:T -> so R is in position 4. And we haven\'t tested position 4 for R.\n\nAlso, COURT uses C, O, U, R, T -> all new letters (except R) and common.\n\nBut we don\'t have E, so it\'s valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""GROUP"": G(1), R(2), O(3), U(4), P(5) -> but R is in position 2, which we already know is wrong. So we would get \'-\' for R again, and we already know that. So it\'s better to avoid position 2 for R.\n\nTherefore, avoid words with R in position 2.\n\nSo, ""COURT"" is good: R in position 4.\n\nAnother option: ""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> R in position 2? B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> position 2, which we want to avoid.\n\nSo not that.\n\n""THORN"" -> T, H, O, R, N -> R in position 4? T(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> yes. And no A, I, S, E -> allowed.\n\nBut we also want to test U? Not necessarily.\n\nI think ""COURT"" is a good choice because it tests C, O, U, T and R in a new position (4).\n\nAlternatively, ""ROUND"" tests R, O, U, N, D with R in position 1.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nBut note: we have only one R, and we are testing it in a new position.\n\nI\'ll go with ""ROUND"" because it tests R at position 1 and also includes common letters.\n\nBut let me check if ""ROUND"" is a valid word: yes.\n\nSo, my second guess: ROUND.\n\nBut wait, what if the secret word has R in position 1? Then we get a check. If not, we might get a minus for R and also learn about O, U, N, D.\n\nAlternatively, if we use ""COURT"", we test R in position 4.\n\nSince we don\'t have any information about position 1, it might be good to test R there.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nI\'ll choose ""ROUND"".\n\nBut let me see: after ""arise"" with R being misplaced, and we know it\'s not in position 2, if we put R in position 1 and it\'s correct, that would be great. If not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""ROUND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""arise"":\n- A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word (marked with \'x\').\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (marked with \'-\').\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include R (in a position other than 2) and exclude A, I, S, E.\n- To maximize information, I chose a word with R in position 1 (a new position to test) and introduced new common letters: O, U, N, D.\n- ""round"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits these criteria and helps test for other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (N, D).\n\n<guess>round</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: round -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess ""arise"":\n  A: x (not in word)\n  R: - (in word, but wrong position; so R is not in position 2)\n  I: x (not in word)\n  S: x (not in word)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nSecond guess ""round"":\n  R: - (in word, wrong position; so R is not in position 1 either, because we tried position 1 now and got \'-\')\n  O: x (not in word)\n  U: - (in word, wrong position; so U is in the word but not in position 3)\n  N: x (not in word)\n  D: x (not in word)\n\nNow, we know:\n\nLetters not in the word: A, I, S, E, O, N, D\n\nLetters in the word: R and U\n\nWe also know the positions for R: it cannot be in position 1 (from ""round"") or position 2 (from ""arise""). So it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, U is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""round"").\n\nWe have used two guesses. We have four more.\n\nWe need to form a new 5-letter word that:\n- Contains R (in position 3, 4, or 5)\n- Contains U (not in position 3)\n- Does not contain A, I, S, E, O, N, D\n\nAdditionally, we can use other letters that haven\'t been tried yet.\n\nThe remaining letters (not tried and not excluded) are: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe want to maximize information by covering new letters and different positions.\n\nAlso, we need to consider the positions for R and U.\n\nSince R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and U must not be in 3, so U can be in 1,2,4,5. But note: we don\'t know the secret word, so U could be in any position but 3.\n\nWe can try to place R in one of the possible positions and U in another.\n\nLet\'s list possible positions:\n\nFor R: 3,4,5\nFor U: 1,2,4,5\n\nBut note: if we put R and U in the same position? No, they are different letters.\n\nWe must avoid positions that we already know are wrong for these letters.\n\nWe haven\'t tested positions 4 and 5 for U, and positions 3,4,5 for R.\n\nPossible words:\n\nWe need a word that has R in 3,4, or 5 and U somewhere else.\n\nSince we don\'t know where U is, we can try to put U in a position we haven\'t tested. We have tested U in position 3 (got \'-\') and R in position 1 (got \'-\') and 2 (we didn\'t try? Wait, in ""arise"" R was in position 2 and got \'-\', so we know R is not in position 2). For U, only position 3 has been tried.\n\nSo we can try U in position 1,2,4,5.\n\nSimilarly for R, we have tried position 1 (in ""round"") and position 2 (in ""arise"") and both were \'-\', so R must be in 3,4, or 5.\n\nLet us try to formulate words without the excluded letters and with R and U.\n\nExcluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D\n\nAvailable: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe also want common words to maximize the chance.\n\nTry words with U and R.\n\nPossible common letters: T, L, M, P, etc.\n\nWords:\n\n- If U is at position 1: then U _ _ R_ ? But we need to fill.\n\n  U in 1, R in 4? Example: ""ULCER"" but E is excluded. ""ULTRA"" but A is excluded.\n\n  ""ULTRA"" has A, which is out. No.\n\n  ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E is excluded. No.\n\n  ""UMPTY"" not a word.\n\n  ""UNCUT"" has N and C? U, N, C, U, T? Wait, ""UNCUT"" has N (excluded) and U twice? Also N is excluded.\n\n  We cannot use N.\n\n  So, U in position 1: hard to find without excluded letters.\n\n  Example: ""UPTURN"" too long.\n\n  ""UTILE"" has E and I? U, T, I, L, E -> I and E excluded.\n\n  Maybe ""UGLY"" too short?\n\n  Let me think of common words: ""USURY"" has S? U, S, U, R, Y -> S is excluded.\n\n  ""USURP"" -> U, S, U, R, P -> S excluded.\n\n  Difficult with U at start.\n\n- U at position 2: _ U _ _ _\n\n  Then with R in position 3,4, or 5.\n\n  Example: if R in 4: _ U _ R _\n\n  Words: ""CURLY"" -> C, U, R, L, Y? But R is in position 3? Because C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5). But we want R in 4? Here R is in 3.\n\n  We can have R in 3: so _ U R _ _\n\n  Examples: ""BURMA"" but A excluded. ""BURQA"" not common. ""BURST"" has S excluded.\n\n  ""CURVE"" -> C, U, R, V, E -> E excluded.\n\n  ""CURVY"" -> C, U, R, V, Y -> and V and Y are allowed. But R is in position 3.\n\n  But does it have excluded? Letters: C,U,R,V,Y -> no A,I,S,E,O,N,D -> acceptable.\n\n  Also, it tests C, V, Y.\n\n  Another: ""FURRY"" has two R\'s? F,U,R,R,Y -> but we don\'t know if R can be duplicated. But it might, so let\'s consider. However, we have R only once so far, but the secret word might have two R\'s? Yes, possible.\n\n  But in ""curvy"", R is in position 3.\n\n  Alternatively, if R in position 4: so _ U ? R _\n\n  For example, ""GOURD"" but O excluded because in ""round"" O is x, so O not present.\n\n  O is excluded? Yes, from ""round"": O(x), so O is not in the word.\n\n  Similarly, in ""round"", O was guessed and marked x, so O is not in the word.\n\n  So we must avoid O.\n\n  ""GOURD"" has O? G,O,U,R,D -> O and D excluded.\n\n  No.\n\n  So for _ U _ R _, let\'s make a word: like ""PUTTY"" has U? P,U,T,T,Y -> but T,T. And R is missing? We need to have R.\n\n  We need R in the word.\n\n  So for U in 2, R in 4: we have pattern _ U ? R ? \n\n  Words: ""CURRY"" has R in 3 and 4? C,U,R,R,Y -> but position 3 is R and position 4 is R? Specifically: position 4 is R? No: C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) so yes R at position 4? Actually, the fourth letter is R. But we also have R at position 3? So ""CURRY"" has R at positions 3 and 4? It depends on the word.\n\n  But we need only one R? Not necessarily.\n\n  However, we know that R is present at least once. But it could be twice.\n\n  But if we use two R\'s, we might get confused.\n\n  Better to choose a word with U and R only once to avoid ambiguity.\n\n  So, let\'s avoid duplicate letters for now.\n\n  So, _ U ? R _ ? With no duplicates and no excluded letters.\n\n  Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\n  Suppose U in 2, R in 4: then positions:\n  1: one of B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z\n  2: U\n  3: one of the available letters\n  4: R\n  5: one of the available letters\n\n  Examples: \n  ""CURRY"" has two R\'s.\n  ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> letters: M,U,R,K,Y -> all allowed? M, U, R, K, Y -> and no excluded? Yes. But R is in position 3? M(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). So R is in 3, not 4.\n\n  If we want R in 4: so the letter in position 4 is R. So the letter after U must be the fourth? That is position 4.\n\n  So the pattern: position 1: ?, 2: U, 3: some letter, 4: R, 5: ?\n\n  Words: ""CURRY"" would have position 4 as R? In ""curry"": C(1),U(2),R(3),R(4) – wait, actually it\'s C(1),U(2),R(3),R(4) so position 4 is R.\n\n  So ""CURRY"" works: U in 2 and R in 4? But in position 3 we also have R? So if the secret word has only one R, we might get multiple feedbacks.\n\n  Another word: ""SURFY"" but S is excluded. ""HURRY"" has H,U,R,R,Y -> R at position 3 and 4? Similarly.\n\n  ""LURCH"" -> L, U, R, C, H -> R is in position 3? L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)? Not 4.\n\n  ""BURET"" has E? B,U,R,E,T -> E excluded.\n\n  ""FUROR"" has O? F,U,R,O,R -> O excluded.\n\n  ""PURTY"" not a word.\n\n  ""MURTI"" not common.\n\n  How about ""CURVY"" but R is in 3.\n\n  Another word: ""BUYER"" has E? B,U,Y,E,R -> E excluded.\n\n  This is challenging.\n\n  Let\'s try U in position 4.\n\n  Or perhaps U in position 5.\n\nLet\'s try U in position 4: ... U\n\nPattern: ... U, so U in 4, and R in 3 or 5? Or in another position.\n\nPosition 4: U, then U cannot be in position 3 because we know U is not in 3, but 4 is fine.\n\nAlso R in 3,4,5? But if U in 4, and R in 4, same position? Not possible.\n\nSo R cannot be in 4 if U is there? But they are different letters.\n\nU in 4, R in 3 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, U in 5: R in 3,4.\n\nSo let\'s pattern U in 4:\n\n? ? ? U ?\n\nWith R somewhere.\n\nIf R in 3: ... then positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:R, 4:U, 5:?\n\nBut we need R in 3 and U in 4.\n\nWords: ""TRUTH"" has T,R,U,T,H -> R at 2? T(1),R(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> not matching pattern.\n\n""GRUMP"" -> G,R,U,M,P -> R in 2, U in 3? But U is in position 3, which we already know is not allowed for U (from ""round"", U was in position 3 and got \'-\')? No, wait: In ""round"", U was in position 3? Let me check ""round"": R(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> so U was in position 3 and got \'-\', meaning U is in the word but not in position 3. So we can try U in other positions, but not 3.\n\nSo for U in position 4: pattern _ _ R U ? or _ _ ? U R\n\nIf R in 3 and U in 4: then _ _ R U ?\n\nExample: ""CHRUT"" not a word. ""FRUMP"" -> F,R,U,M,P -> but U is in 3? F(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5) -> not U in 4.\n\n""TRUMUD"" too long.\n\n""TRUMP"" -> T,R,U,M,P -> U in 3? T(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5) -> U in pos 3, not 4.\n\nIt\'s hard.\n\nPerhaps U in position 5.\n\nPattern: ? ? ? ? U\n\nWith R in 3 or 4.\n\nFor example, R in 3: _ _ R ? U\n\nWords: ""CARBU"" not a word.\n\n""MARAU"" not a word.\n\nCommon word: ""THUMB"" but U is not at end. H is position? T,H,U,M,B -> U is 3.\n\n""VAGUER"" too long.\n\nPerhaps not common.\n\nSince U is a vowel and we have few vowels left we can try, but the word must have U.\n\nAnother idea: use U in position 2 and R in position 5.\n\nPattern: _ U _ _ R\n\nSo U in 2, R in 5.\n\nWords: ""QUOTER"" has O and E?

We don\'t know if it is valid or not, but we are testing it.\n\nSince we know U is not in position 3, but position 2 could be.\n\nR in position 3 could be correct.\n\nSo ""curvy"" seems okay.\n\nAnother word: ""TRYST"" but no U.\n\nWe must include U and R.\n\n""GLYPH"" no U.\n\nI think ""curvy"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: C, U, R, V, Y -> all not excluded.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""CURVY"".\n\nBut in the pattern, U is in positions 2 and R in 3.\n\nWe haven\'t tested position 2 for U, so it might be correct or wrong.\n\nIf U is not in position 2, we\'ll get a \'-\' if it\'s elsewhere or \'x\' if not present?

We are given feedback from four guesses:

1. ""arise"": A(not in word), R(in word but wrong position), I(not), S(not), E(not)
2. ""round"": R(in word but wrong position), O(not), U(in word but wrong position), N(not), D(not)
3. ""curvy"": C(not), U(correct position), R(correct position), V(not), Y(correct position)
4. ""burly"": B(not), U(correct), R(correct), L(not), Y(correct)

From this, we know definitively:
- Positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed: Position 2 is U, Position 3 is R, Position 5 is Y.
- The secret word is of the form: ? U R ? Y
- Eliminated letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V, B, L (from 'x' feedback in various guesses)

Additionally, note that for Guess1: R was in position 2 but marked '-', which is consistent with our fixed position (now we know R is at position 3). Similarly, in Guess2 R was in position 1 (wrong) and U was in position 3 (wrong), but now we have U at 2 and R at 3.

Now, the remaining positions are 1 and 4. We need to fill in one letter at position 1 and one at position 4 from the letters not yet eliminated.

Available letters (not eliminated): F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z

But the word must be a valid English word. Pattern: _ U R _ Y

We need to find a word that fits ? U R ? Y, with both ? being from the available letters.

Possible words:
- FURRY: F U R R Y -> but R is duplicated? And position 4 would be R. Note that we haven't excluded R as a possibility for position 4? But wait, in ""curvy"" we only tested R at position 3 (which was correct) but not at position 4. So R could theoretically be at position 4? The secret word might have two R's? Yes. Because we only know of one R from the initial feedback, but it could appear twice. However, we haven't had feedback that directly contradicts it.
- HURRY: H U R R Y -> similarly.
- But let's see: in Guess4 we guessed L at position 4 and got 'x', meaning L is not in the word and specifically not at position 4.

Other possibilities beyond ""furry"" and ""hurry"": 
- MURKY: M U R K Y -> available letters: M and K are not excluded.
- TURFY: not common, and T is available.
- JURY is 4 letters.
- GURDY? Not common.
- PURDY: but D is eliminated? From Guess2 D(x), yes.
- BURLY was tried: B U R L Y -> B and L were eliminated.
- FURLY? Not common.

So: 
- FURRY: F and R (R duplicated) -> but R is already used? The fourth letter is R.
- HURRY: H and R.
- MURKY: M and K.

Which of these are valid? 
- ""furry"" (adj, covered with fur)
- ""hurry"" (verb, to rush)
- ""murky"" (adj, dark and gloomy)

Also ""curvy"" was tried but doesn't fit fourth letter.

We might have ""purry""? Not a word.

Or ""turvy"" as in ""topsy-turvy"", but not standalone.

So feasible words: ""furry"", ""hurry"", ""murky"".

Now, to choose one: 
- If we test ""murky"", we test M and K, and if incorrect, we know to look for words with duplicate R?
- But we have limited guesses (2 left after this).

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests a letter not duplicated? For example, ""murky"" has no duplicate letters.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate R or not.

Since we haven't tested any duplicate R scenarios, both are possible.

But note: in all previous guesses, we have not guessed a word with R duplicated, so we don't have direct feedback on whether there's a second R.

However, we know from ""curvy"": R was placed in position 3 and we got a check (so should be only one R? Not necessarily, because the feedback shows only if the letter is in the word and position. For example, if the word had two R's, and we guess one R in the correct position, we would still get a check? But if we guess R in a wrong position for the duplicate, we might get a '-'. But in ""curvy"", we didn't try to put R in another position.

Similarly, in other guesses.

But no feedback indicated a second R? Not directly. However, we know R is in the word, and no feedback negates the possibility of multiple R's.

So, to resolve, we could guess ""murky"" to test M and K without duplication. Then, if incorrect, we can guess ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

But if we guess ""murky"" and it's correct, we win. If not, we have one more guess.

Similarly, if we guess ""furry"", if correct we win; if not, we know the word must be ""hurry"" or another, but the only other option is ""hurry""? Or ""murky""?

We have two strong candidates: one with duplicate R and one without.

So we need to pick one.

But note: the pattern ? U R ? Y: 
- If position 4 is R, then word must be * U R R Y -> like ""furry"", ""hurry"".
- If position 4 is not R, then it's a different letter, like in ""murky"" (K).

Available letters for position 1: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z, but the word must be valid.

For position 4: from available letters, but not R? We can test with R or without.

Since we don't know, but we have to choose.

Practical approach: guess ""murky"" because it tests M and K, which are common, and if the feedback shows M or K not present, then we know the word must have R in position 4.

But let's simulate: if we guess ""murky"", and secret is ""furry"":
- Position1: M vs F -> x (M not in secret)
- Position2: U -> ✓ (correct)
- Position3: R -> ✓ (correct)
- Position4: K vs R -> ? Since in secret R is present, but not at position4? In ""furry"", position4 is R, so if secret is ""furry"", then K is not in the word and R is missing? Wait, no: the secret ""furry"" has positions: F(1), U(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). For guess ""murky"": M(1) -> should be x? Because F is at 1. U(2)✓, R(3)✓, then K(4): secret has R at position4, so K is not R -> x? But R is in the word? Yes, but we already accounted for R at position3? How is the feedback for duplicate letters? In Wordle rules: 
For a word with duplicate letters, see: 
If the secret has two R's and we guess one R correctly, and another R in the wrong position, we get - for the second R? But in this case, for ""murky"":
- M: not in secret -> x
- U: correct
- R: correct position -> ✓
- K: not in secret -> x
- Y: correct -> ✓
So feedback: M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)

But if secret is ""furry"", then K is not in the word? Yes, K is absent. So we get M(x), U(✓), R(✓), K(x), Y(✓). That doesn't reveal the fourth position.

But we would know that position4 is not K, but it doesn't tell us what it is.

We have used the guess showing M and K incorrect.

Then we still don't know if it's ""furry"" or ""hurry"", etc.

But we have only one guess left? So we need to test one of them.

But that was inefficient.

Alternatively, guess ""furry"": 
If secret is ""furry"", we win.
If secret is ""hurry"", we get: F at position1 vs H -> so F would be x? Because H is at 1 in ""hurry"". Then U✓, R✓, R✓ (because R is in secret twice, and we guessed it at position4? In secret ""hurry"": H(1),U(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5). Guess ""furry"": F(1),U(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5). Positions:
- F vs H: F not in secret? But secret has no F -> x? But is F present? Secret ""hurry"" has no F -> x for F.
- U✓
- R✓ (position3)
- R✓ (position4) because secret has R at position4? Yes? Since we guessed R at position4 and secret has R at position4, it should be check? ✓
- Y✓
So feedback: F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓) -> which shows that R is correct at position4, but we don't get the letter for position1.

But we see F is wrong, and position1 is incorrect.

But we know then that the secret word has R at position4? Because R4 is ✓? And also R3 is ✓? But we already knew R3.

So from this, we know position1 must be the one causing issue? And position4 is R.

But we have to guess again? Only if we don't win.

In this scenario, after ""furry"", we see that F is incorrect? And we have to try HURRY for position1? But then we have one guess.

But if we guess ""furry"" and secret is ""furry"", we win.

If secret is ""hurry"", we get feedback F(x) ... and R at 4✓, so we know the pattern is ? U R R Y, and we know position1 must be not F? So we can guess ""hurry"" next? And we win? Given we have tries left.

But similarly for ""murky"".

But to solve faster, we should guess a word that distinguishes the possibilities.

Since we are running out of guesses, let’s list the possible words we can form with pattern.

Possible words: 
With duplicate R: FURRY, HURRY
Without duplicate R: MURKY (and perhaps others? Like ... TURGY? Not common. PURRY? No.)

But ""murky"" is likely the only common one without duplicate R.

Also, ""gurly"" not common.

Therefore, we have three candidates: ""furry"", ""hurry"", ""murky"".

With two guesses left, we can choose one arbitrarily.

But note: from Guess4 ""burly"", we guessed L at position4 and got x, so position4 cannot be L? And not B at position1? But we already knew that.

Similarly, available letters for position4: from available, but to form word.

Perhaps guess ""murky"" to test if it's not duplicated R? Then if ""murky"" is correct, done? If not, then duplicate R must be in the word? So then we guess ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

But which one?

We don't have information to distinguish ""furry"" and ""hurry"".

So we have to guess arbitrarily.

Therefore, to maximize commonality? Or reduce options.

Since we have to choose, let's pick ""murky"" first? Or directly the duplicate R word.

But let me check if there are more words: 
- ""jumpy""? No pattern, must be J U R P Y? Not standard. J U M P Y -> no R fixed.
- The word must have U R R Y pattern? Or U R K Y? Etc.

Another word: ""turfy"" might be accepted? T U R F Y -> but F in position4? And T in 1? Not common.

Similarly, ""purty"" not.

So three options: furry, hurry, murky.

Let us guess ""furry"".

Why? Because it might win immediately if correct? But then if not, we know to try ""hurry"" or ""murky"" next? And we have one guess left? But if we guess ""furry"" and it's ""hurry"", we get feedback that F is wrong? Then we can guess ""hurry"" for the fifth guess? And if ""murky"", we lose.

Similarly, if we guess ""murky"" and it's not, we know to guess a duplicate R word? Then we can guess ""hurry"" for fifth? But we don't know if ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

Therefore, we need a guess that covers the first letter possibilities.

But we can't avoid guessing one of them.

Since no guess gives all information, we should pick one arbitrarily.

Let me pick ""hurry"" because H is a common letter? Or ""murky"" to avoid assumption on duplication.

Another idea: is there a word that fits the pattern with a letter we haven't tried? Such as ""purry""? Not valid.

Really, ""furry"", ""hurry"", ""murky"" seem the main words.

I think ""murky"" is a good choice to test if there is a double R or not.

If we guess ""murky"":

- If it's correct: we win.
- If not, then the word must have double R? So for the fifth guess, we guess ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

But which one? We still don't know.

After guessing ""murky"" and getting e.g. M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓), feedback:

- Position1: unknown, but M is wrong? So if not ""murky"", then position4 must be R? Because we know U, R, Y are in place, so the word must be * U R R Y where * can be F or H or others? P et c, but common are F or H.

But we have not tested F or H? So we have to guess between furry and hurry? Or check the dictionary.

So for fifth guess, we can guess ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

But with no additional info.

Therefore, guessing ""murky"" first doesn't resolve position1.

Similarly, if we guess ""furry"" and it's not, we know to guess ""hurry"" for position1? Or if not ""hurry"", then ""murky"" must be if not? But if ""furry"" is not and secret is ""murky"", then after ""furry"" feedback: F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓) -> wait for position4 we got ✓? But if secret is ""murky"", which has no R at position4? Then feedback on ""furry"" vs secret ""murky"":
- Position1: F vs M -> F not in secret? x
- Position2: U✓
- Position3: R✓
- Position4: R vs K? Secret position4 has K? So R is not in position4? But secret has only one R? At position3? So when we guess R at position4, secret does not have R at position4? And we have already used the only R? So R at position4: since secret has no second R? Then feedback: R is not in the word? But we have a ✓ at position3? It should be specific per position. For position4: since K is at position4 in secret? We guess R, which is not in secret? But secret has R only at position3? And we already marked R at position3 as ✓? So for position4? R is not in position4 and also not present elsewhere? But we know R is in the word? Therefore, position4 guess R: letter is in the word? No additional? Only if not account duplicates, R is present but not at position4? So it should be '-', because R is in the word? Or 'x' if no additional R?

This depends on the implementation, but typically, if the secret has one R and we guess two R's, one at correct and one at wrong position, the one at correct gets ✓, the one at wrong position gets '-' if there is only one occurrence? Or x if the guess has extra.

But most Wordle: 
- For duplicate letter feedback: it marks greens first, then yellows for the correct letters in wrong positions.

Example: secret SKILL, guess KILLS:
- First letter K vs SKILL: K is not at position1? So is K in the word? Yes, so mark '-' but for our case:

Secret: M U R K Y ? Or F U R R Y?

Suppose secret is ""murky"": only one R at position3.

Guess ""furry"": positions: 
- F: not in secret -> x? Specifically: letter F absent? x
- U: correct and position? U✓
- R: correct position? position3 R ✓? Position3: secret has R, guess has R? ✓? Position4: guess has R? Secret has K? So R at position4: is R present elsewhere? No, secret has only one R at position3? Which we already matched? So for position4, R is not in the secret? So it should be x? Because no additional R.

Similarly in Wordle: secret ""caulk"", guess ""fauna"": first A at position2 is ✓? But second A at position5; secret has no second A? So position5 A: x? Because the duplicate exceeded actual count.

So similarly: for guess ""furry"" against secret ""murky"":
- Position1: F not in secret? x
- Position2: U✓
- Position3: R✓
- Position4: R? But secret has only one R? Already counted? So no remaining R? Therefore R not present? So x? And Y✓ 
- So feedback: F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(x) Y(✓) -> note: the second R at position4 is x.

In feedback format: ✓ for U,R,Y? And x for F and the second R.

Similarly, if secret is ""furry"": guess ""murky"" gives M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)

So to differentiate: 
- If we guess ""murky"" and secret is ""furry"", we get M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓? But Y is position5? In ""murky"" Y is position5, in ""furry"" Y position5? So Y should be ✓? So yes: M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)
- Similarly, secret ""hurry"" guess ""murky"": same.

And secret ""murky"" guess ""furry"": as above.

In addition, guess ""furry"" against ""hurry"": 
- Position1: F vs H? Secret has H? So F is not in secret -> x? But secret has H, which is not F? So F absent? x
- U✓, R✓, R✓ (because secret has R at position4), Y✓ -> feedback F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)

In this case, position4 got ✓.

Similarly, guess ""hurry"" against ""furry"": H(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)

So only position1 is different.

Therefore, after any guess, we can tell.

Given this, with two guesses left, we can choose any one.

I think the safest is to guess ""murky"" first? Because if it's correct, done? If not, then the secret must be one of the duplicate R words? And we have one guess left? So we can guess ""furry"" or ""hurry""? But which one? We have no info on F and H.

For example, if we guess ""murky"" and it's not correct? Then we have to guess either ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

But we don't know which one? We may lose.

Similarly, if we guess ""furry"" and it's not correct, then if secret is ""hurry"", we get P1 F x and P4 R ✓, so we know to guess ""hurry"" next? But if secret is ""murky"", we get P1 F x, P4 R x, so we know to .ot ""murky"" next? But we have only one more guess.

After guess ""furry"" with secret ""murky"", we get:
 F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(x) Y(✓)

 From this, we know:
- U,R,Y fixed.
- Position1: not F? And not any excluded letter.
- Position4: not R (because we guessed R and got x? But why x? Because no extra R? So position4 has a letter that is not R and not F (since F not in word)? Also not in available.

But we also know position4 is not R? Because feedbackx means it's not the letter? So position4 has some other letter? Not R? But in ""murky"", it's K.

So from feedback R(x) at position4, we know position4 is not R? And also K is present in secret? But not? In this feedback, we only got R(x) at position4? But we don't know what is at position4 except it's not R.

Then for next guess? We need to guess a word with pattern ? U R ? Y, with position4 not R and not L,et c? So we try ""murky""? Which has M and K? But we don't know K.

It's messy.

Therefore, with multiple options, we need to guess one of the three.

I think the most common word among the three is ""hurry"" or ""furry"" or ""murky"".

But from usage, ""hurry"" is common.

Otherwise, ""murky"".

So let’s guess ""hurry"".

Then if correct, win? If not, but secret is ""furry"", we get feedback? Then fifth guess ""furry"" if not.

Similarly, if secret is ""murky"", after guess ""hurry"" vs ""murky"": 
- H(1) vs M -> H not in secret? x
- U✓
- R✓
- R: position4 R vs secret K? But secret has only one R? So R at position4: since secret has no extra R? So x? Or we could say?

Secret ""murky"" guess ""hurry"":
- H position1: not in secret? x
- U✓
- R position3: ✓
- R position4: secret has K? And only one R already counted? So extra R not in secret? x
- Y✓

So feedback: H(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(x) Y(✓)

Then we know position4 is not R? And not H? So then we can guess ""murky"" for position1 M and position4 K? And win.

Similarly, if secret is ""furry"": guess ""hurry"" would give  H position1 vs F? Secret has F at1? H not F? So H absent? x, then U✓, R✓, R✓, Y✓? So feedback H(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓) -> then we know position4 is R? But position1 is wrong? So we guess ""furry"" next.

So in both cases, with one more guess, we can solve it.

Therefore, I will guess ""hurry"" now.

If not, we have one guess to correct.

So choice: ""HURRY""Based on the pattern _ U R _ Y and eliminated letters:
- Must fill positions 1 and 4.
- Eliminated letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V, B, L (from all 'x' feedback).
- Available letters for positions 1/4: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z.

Possible common words fitting pattern:
- ""furry"" (F in 1, R in 4)  
- ""hurry"" (H in 1, R in 4)  
- ""murky"" (M in 1, K in 4)  

### Reasoning:  
- ""Hurry"" is chosen for the 4th guess:  
  - Tests H at position 1 and R at position 4. 
- If correct, the game ends.  
- If incorrect, feedback will:  
  - Confirm if position 4 is R (✓ or -/x) or not.  
  - Reveal if position 1 is viable.  

With multiple candidates, ""hurry"" maximizes commonality and leaves one guess to resolve.  

<guess>hurry</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:

- **Positions 2, 3, and 5** are confirmed as U, R, and Y respectively.  
- The secret word pattern is: `_ U R _ Y`.  
- **Eliminated letters (A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V, B, L)** reduce the possible letters for positions 1 and 4 to: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z.  
- Common valid words fitting the pattern are ""furry"" (F U R R Y), ""hurry"" (H U R R Y), and ""murky"" (M U R K Y).  

For the fourth guess, ""hurry"" is selected to test:  
- H at position 1 (possibly correct).  
- R at position 4 (revealing if duplication exists).  

If incorrect, feedback on H and the second R (position 4) will narrow down to ""furry"" or ""murky"" for the next guess.  

<guess>hurry</guess>",hurry,"We are given feedback from four guesses:

1. ""arise"": A(not in word), R(in word but wrong position), I(not), S(not), E(not)
2. ""round"": R(in word but wrong position), O(not), U(in word but wrong position), N(not), D(not)
3. ""curvy"": C(not), U(correct position), R(correct position), V(not), Y(correct position)
4. ""burly"": B(not), U(correct), R(correct), L(not), Y(correct)

From this, we know definitively:
- Positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed: Position 2 is U, Position 3 is R, Position 5 is Y.
- The secret word is of the form: ? U R ? Y
- Eliminated letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V, B, L (from 'x' feedback in various guesses)

Additionally, note that for Guess1: R was in position 2 but marked '-', which is consistent with our fixed position (now we know R is at position 3). Similarly, in Guess2 R was in position 1 (wrong) and U was in position 3 (wrong), but now we have U at 2 and R at 3.

Now, the remaining positions are 1 and 4. We need to fill in one letter at position 1 and one at position 4 from the letters not yet eliminated.

Available letters (not eliminated): F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z

But the word must be a valid English word. Pattern: _ U R _ Y

We need to find a word that fits ? U R ? Y, with both ? being from the available letters.

Possible words:
- FURRY: F U R R Y -> but R is duplicated? And position 4 would be R. Note that we haven't excluded R as a possibility for position 4? But wait, in ""curvy"" we only tested R at position 3 (which was correct) but not at position 4. So R could theoretically be at position 4? The secret word might have two R's? Yes. Because we only know of one R from the initial feedback, but it could appear twice. However, we haven't had feedback that directly contradicts it.
- HURRY: H U R R Y -> similarly.
- But let's see: in Guess4 we guessed L at position 4 and got 'x', meaning L is not in the word and specifically not at position 4.

Other possibilities beyond ""furry"" and ""hurry"": 
- MURKY: M U R K Y -> available letters: M and K are not excluded.
- TURFY: not common, and T is available.
- JURY is 4 letters.
- GURDY? Not common.
- PURDY: but D is eliminated? From Guess2 D(x), yes.
- BURLY was tried: B U R L Y -> B and L were eliminated.
- FURLY? Not common.

So: 
- FURRY: F and R (R duplicated) -> but R is already used? The fourth letter is R.
- HURRY: H and R.
- MURKY: M and K.

Which of these are valid? 
- ""furry"" (adj, covered with fur)
- ""hurry"" (verb, to rush)
- ""murky"" (adj, dark and gloomy)

Also ""curvy"" was tried but doesn't fit fourth letter.

We might have ""purry""? Not a word.

Or ""turvy"" as in ""topsy-turvy"", but not standalone.

So feasible words: ""furry"", ""hurry"", ""murky"".

Now, to choose one: 
- If we test ""murky"", we test M and K, and if incorrect, we know to look for words with duplicate R?
- But we have limited guesses (2 left after this).

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests a letter not duplicated? For example, ""murky"" has no duplicate letters.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate R or not.

Since we haven't tested any duplicate R scenarios, both are possible.

But note: in all previous guesses, we have not guessed a word with R duplicated, so we don't have direct feedback on whether there's a second R.

However, we know from ""curvy"": R was placed in position 3 and we got a check (so should be only one R? Not necessarily, because the feedback shows only if the letter is in the word and position. For example, if the word had two R's, and we guess one R in the correct position, we would still get a check? But if we guess R in a wrong position for the duplicate, we might get a '-'. But in ""curvy"", we didn't try to put R in another position.

Similarly, in other guesses.

But no feedback indicated a second R? Not directly. However, we know R is in the word, and no feedback negates the possibility of multiple R's.

So, to resolve, we could guess ""murky"" to test M and K without duplication. Then, if incorrect, we can guess ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

But if we guess ""murky"" and it's correct, we win. If not, we have one more guess.

Similarly, if we guess ""furry"", if correct we win; if not, we know the word must be ""hurry"" or another, but the only other option is ""hurry""? Or ""murky""?

We have two strong candidates: one with duplicate R and one without.

So we need to pick one.

But note: the pattern ? U R ? Y: 
- If position 4 is R, then word must be * U R R Y -> like ""furry"", ""hurry"".
- If position 4 is not R, then it's a different letter, like in ""murky"" (K).

Available letters for position 1: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z, but the word must be valid.

For position 4: from available letters, but not R? We can test with R or without.

Since we don't know, but we have to choose.

Practical approach: guess ""murky"" because it tests M and K, which are common, and if the feedback shows M or K not present, then we know the word must have R in position 4.

But let's simulate: if we guess ""murky"", and secret is ""furry"":
- Position1: M vs F -> x (M not in secret)
- Position2: U -> ✓ (correct)
- Position3: R -> ✓ (correct)
- Position4: K vs R -> ? Since in secret R is present, but not at position4? In ""furry"", position4 is R, so if secret is ""furry"", then K is not in the word and R is missing? Wait, no: the secret ""furry"" has positions: F(1), U(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). For guess ""murky"": M(1) -> should be x? Because F is at 1. U(2)✓, R(3)✓, then K(4): secret has R at position4, so K is not R -> x? But R is in the word? Yes, but we already accounted for R at position3? How is the feedback for duplicate letters? In Wordle rules: 
For a word with duplicate letters, see: 
If the secret has two R's and we guess one R correctly, and another R in the wrong position, we get - for the second R? But in this case, for ""murky"":
- M: not in secret -> x
- U: correct
- R: correct position -> ✓
- K: not in secret -> x
- Y: correct -> ✓
So feedback: M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)

But if secret is ""furry"", then K is not in the word? Yes, K is absent. So we get M(x), U(✓), R(✓), K(x), Y(✓). That doesn't reveal the fourth position.

But we would know that position4 is not K, but it doesn't tell us what it is.

We have used the guess showing M and K incorrect.

Then we still don't know if it's ""furry"" or ""hurry"", etc.

But we have only one guess left? So we need to test one of them.

But that was inefficient.

Alternatively, guess ""furry"": 
If secret is ""furry"", we win.
If secret is ""hurry"", we get: F at position1 vs H -> so F would be x? Because H is at 1 in ""hurry"". Then U✓, R✓, R✓ (because R is in secret twice, and we guessed it at position4? In secret ""hurry"": H(1),U(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5). Guess ""furry"": F(1),U(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5). Positions:
- F vs H: F not in secret? But secret has no F -> x? But is F present? Secret ""hurry"" has no F -> x for F.
- U✓
- R✓ (position3)
- R✓ (position4) because secret has R at position4? Yes? Since we guessed R at position4 and secret has R at position4, it should be check? ✓
- Y✓
So feedback: F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓) -> which shows that R is correct at position4, but we don't get the letter for position1.

But we see F is wrong, and position1 is incorrect.

But we know then that the secret word has R at position4? Because R4 is ✓? And also R3 is ✓? But we already knew R3.

So from this, we know position1 must be the one causing issue? And position4 is R.

But we have to guess again? Only if we don't win.

In this scenario, after ""furry"", we see that F is incorrect? And we have to try HURRY for position1? But then we have one guess.

But if we guess ""furry"" and secret is ""furry"", we win.

If secret is ""hurry"", we get feedback F(x) ... and R at 4✓, so we know the pattern is ? U R R Y, and we know position1 must be not F? So we can guess ""hurry"" next? And we win? Given we have tries left.

But similarly for ""murky"".

But to solve faster, we should guess a word that distinguishes the possibilities.

Since we are running out of guesses, let’s list the possible words we can form with pattern.

Possible words: 
With duplicate R: FURRY, HURRY
Without duplicate R: MURKY (and perhaps others? Like ... TURGY? Not common. PURRY? No.)

But ""murky"" is likely the only common one without duplicate R.

Also, ""gurly"" not common.

Therefore, we have three candidates: ""furry"", ""hurry"", ""murky"".

With two guesses left, we can choose one arbitrarily.

But note: from Guess4 ""burly"", we guessed L at position4 and got x, so position4 cannot be L? And not B at position1? But we already knew that.

Similarly, available letters for position4: from available, but to form word.

Perhaps guess ""murky"" to test if it's not duplicated R? Then if ""murky"" is correct, done? If not, then duplicate R must be in the word? So then we guess ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

But which one?

We don't have information to distinguish ""furry"" and ""hurry"".

So we have to guess arbitrarily.

Therefore, to maximize commonality? Or reduce options.

Since we have to choose, let's pick ""murky"" first? Or directly the duplicate R word.

But let me check if there are more words: 
- ""jumpy""? No pattern, must be J U R P Y? Not standard. J U M P Y -> no R fixed.
- The word must have U R R Y pattern? Or U R K Y? Etc.

Another word: ""turfy"" might be accepted? T U R F Y -> but F in position4? And T in 1? Not common.

Similarly, ""purty"" not.

So three options: furry, hurry, murky.

Let us guess ""furry"".

Why? Because it might win immediately if correct? But then if not, we know to try ""hurry"" or ""murky"" next? And we have one guess left? But if we guess ""furry"" and it's ""hurry"", we get feedback that F is wrong? Then we can guess ""hurry"" for the fifth guess? And if ""murky"", we lose.

Similarly, if we guess ""murky"" and it's not, we know to guess a duplicate R word? Then we can guess ""hurry"" for fifth? But we don't know if ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

Therefore, we need a guess that covers the first letter possibilities.

But we can't avoid guessing one of them.

Since no guess gives all information, we should pick one arbitrarily.

Let me pick ""hurry"" because H is a common letter? Or ""murky"" to avoid assumption on duplication.

Another idea: is there a word that fits the pattern with a letter we haven't tried? Such as ""purry""? Not valid.

Really, ""furry"", ""hurry"", ""murky"" seem the main words.

I think ""murky"" is a good choice to test if there is a double R or not.

If we guess ""murky"":

- If it's correct: we win.
- If not, then the word must have double R? So for the fifth guess, we guess ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

But which one? We still don't know.

After guessing ""murky"" and getting e.g. M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓), feedback:

- Position1: unknown, but M is wrong? So if not ""murky"", then position4 must be R? Because we know U, R, Y are in place, so the word must be * U R R Y where * can be F or H or others? P et c, but common are F or H.

But we have not tested F or H? So we have to guess between furry and hurry? Or check the dictionary.

So for fifth guess, we can guess ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

But with no additional info.

Therefore, guessing ""murky"" first doesn't resolve position1.

Similarly, if we guess ""furry"" and it's not, we know to guess ""hurry"" for position1? Or if not ""hurry"", then ""murky"" must be if not? But if ""furry"" is not and secret is ""murky"", then after ""furry"" feedback: F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓) -> wait for position4 we got ✓? But if secret is ""murky"", which has no R at position4? Then feedback on ""furry"" vs secret ""murky"":
- Position1: F vs M -> F not in secret? x
- Position2: U✓
- Position3: R✓
- Position4: R vs K? Secret position4 has K? So R is not in position4? But secret has only one R? At position3? So when we guess R at position4, secret does not have R at position4? And we have already used the only R? So R at position4: since secret has no second R? Then feedback: R is not in the word? But we have a ✓ at position3? It should be specific per position. For position4: since K is at position4 in secret? We guess R, which is not in secret? But secret has R only at position3? And we already marked R at position3 as ✓? So for position4? R is not in position4 and also not present elsewhere? But we know R is in the word? Therefore, position4 guess R: letter is in the word? No additional? Only if not account duplicates, R is present but not at position4? So it should be '-', because R is in the word? Or 'x' if no additional R?

This depends on the implementation, but typically, if the secret has one R and we guess two R's, one at correct and one at wrong position, the one at correct gets ✓, the one at wrong position gets '-' if there is only one occurrence? Or x if the guess has extra.

But most Wordle: 
- For duplicate letter feedback: it marks greens first, then yellows for the correct letters in wrong positions.

Example: secret SKILL, guess KILLS:
- First letter K vs SKILL: K is not at position1? So is K in the word? Yes, so mark '-' but for our case:

Secret: M U R K Y ? Or F U R R Y?

Suppose secret is ""murky"": only one R at position3.

Guess ""furry"": positions: 
- F: not in secret -> x? Specifically: letter F absent? x
- U: correct and position? U✓
- R: correct position? position3 R ✓? Position3: secret has R, guess has R? ✓? Position4: guess has R? Secret has K? So R at position4: is R present elsewhere? No, secret has only one R at position3? Which we already matched? So for position4, R is not in the secret? So it should be x? Because no additional R.

Similarly in Wordle: secret ""caulk"", guess ""fauna"": first A at position2 is ✓? But second A at position5; secret has no second A? So position5 A: x? Because the duplicate exceeded actual count.

So similarly: for guess ""furry"" against secret ""murky"":
- Position1: F not in secret? x
- Position2: U✓
- Position3: R✓
- Position4: R? But secret has only one R? Already counted? So no remaining R? Therefore R not present? So x? And Y✓ 
- So feedback: F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(x) Y(✓) -> note: the second R at position4 is x.

In feedback format: ✓ for U,R,Y? And x for F and the second R.

Similarly, if secret is ""furry"": guess ""murky"" gives M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)

So to differentiate: 
- If we guess ""murky"" and secret is ""furry"", we get M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓? But Y is position5? In ""murky"" Y is position5, in ""furry"" Y position5? So Y should be ✓? So yes: M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)
- Similarly, secret ""hurry"" guess ""murky"": same.

And secret ""murky"" guess ""furry"": as above.

In addition, guess ""furry"" against ""hurry"": 
- Position1: F vs H? Secret has H? So F is not in secret -> x? But secret has H, which is not F? So F absent? x
- U✓, R✓, R✓ (because secret has R at position4), Y✓ -> feedback F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)

In this case, position4 got ✓.

Similarly, guess ""hurry"" against ""furry"": H(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)

So only position1 is different.

Therefore, after any guess, we can tell.

Given this, with two guesses left, we can choose any one.

I think the safest is to guess ""murky"" first? Because if it's correct, done? If not, then the secret must be one of the duplicate R words? And we have one guess left? So we can guess ""furry"" or ""hurry""? But which one? We have no info on F and H.

For example, if we guess ""murky"" and it's not correct? Then we have to guess either ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

But we don't know which one? We may lose.

Similarly, if we guess ""furry"" and it's not correct, then if secret is ""hurry"", we get P1 F x and P4 R ✓, so we know to guess ""hurry"" next? But if secret is ""murky"", we get P1 F x, P4 R x, so we know to .ot ""murky"" next? But we have only one more guess.

After guess ""furry"" with secret ""murky"", we get:
 F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(x) Y(✓)

 From this, we know:
- U,R,Y fixed.
- Position1: not F? And not any excluded letter.
- Position4: not R (because we guessed R and got x? But why x? Because no extra R? So position4 has a letter that is not R and not F (since F not in word)? Also not in available.

But we also know position4 is not R? Because feedbackx means it's not the letter? So position4 has some other letter? Not R? But in ""murky"", it's K.

So from feedback R(x) at position4, we know position4 is not R? And also K is present in secret? But not? In this feedback, we only got R(x) at position4? But we don't know what is at position4 except it's not R.

Then for next guess? We need to guess a word with pattern ? U R ? Y, with position4 not R and not L,et c? So we try ""murky""? Which has M and K? But we don't know K.

It's messy.

Therefore, with multiple options, we need to guess one of the three.

I think the most common word among the three is ""hurry"" or ""furry"" or ""murky"".

But from usage, ""hurry"" is common.

Otherwise, ""murky"".

So let’s guess ""hurry"".

Then if correct, win? If not, but secret is ""furry"", we get feedback? Then fifth guess ""furry"" if not.

Similarly, if secret is ""murky"", after guess ""hurry"" vs ""murky"": 
- H(1) vs M -> H not in secret? x
- U✓
- R✓
- R: position4 R vs secret K? But secret has only one R? So R at position4: since secret has no extra R? So x? Or we could say?

Secret ""murky"" guess ""hurry"":
- H position1: not in secret? x
- U✓
- R position3: ✓
- R position4: secret has K? And only one R already counted? So extra R not in secret? x
- Y✓

So feedback: H(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(x) Y(✓)

Then we know position4 is not R? And not H? So then we can guess ""murky"" for position1 M and position4 K? And win.

Similarly, if secret is ""furry"": guess ""hurry"" would give  H position1 vs F? Secret has F at1? H not F? So H absent? x, then U✓, R✓, R✓, Y✓? So feedback H(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓) -> then we know position4 is R? But position1 is wrong? So we guess ""furry"" next.

So in both cases, with one more guess, we can solve it.

Therefore, I will guess ""hurry"" now.

If not, we have one guess to correct.

So choice: ""HURRY""Based on the pattern _ U R _ Y and eliminated letters:
- Must fill positions 1 and 4.
- Eliminated letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V, B, L (from all 'x' feedback).
- Available letters for positions 1/4: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z.

Possible common words fitting pattern:
- ""furry"" (F in 1, R in 4)  
- ""hurry"" (H in 1, R in 4)  
- ""murky"" (M in 1, K in 4)  

### Reasoning:  
- ""Hurry"" is chosen for the 4th guess:  
  - Tests H at position 1 and R at position 4. 
- If correct, the game ends.  
- If incorrect, feedback will:  
  - Confirm if position 4 is R (✓ or -/x) or not.  
  - Reveal if position 1 is viable.  

With multiple candidates, ""hurry"" maximizes commonality and leaves one guess to resolve.  

<guess>hurry</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

- **Positions 2, 3, and 5** are confirmed as U, R, and Y respectively.  
- The secret word pattern is: `_ U R _ Y`.  
- **Eliminated letters (A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V, B, L)** reduce the possible letters for positions 1 and 4 to: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z.  
- Common valid words fitting the pattern are ""furry"" (F U R R Y), ""hurry"" (H U R R Y), and ""murky"" (M U R K Y).  

For the fourth guess, ""hurry"" is selected to test:  
- H at position 1 (possibly correct).  
- R at position 4 (revealing if duplication exists).  

If incorrect, feedback on H and the second R (position 4) will narrow down to ""furry"" or ""murky"" for the next guess.",Guess 5: hurry -> FEEDBACK: H(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Without any prior information, a good starting word is one that includes common letters and has a balanced letter distribution.
 Common starting words in Wordle often contain multiple vowels and common consonants. Examples: ""CRATE"", ""ROATE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ARISE"", etc.
 I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains A, R, I, S, E which are common letters.For the first guess, I chose ""ARISE"" because it includes common vowels (A, I, E) and frequent consonants (R, S), maximizing the chance to uncover overlaps with the secret word. This provides a solid baseline for deducing the word structure.

<guess>arise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""arise"":
- A: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since we placed it in the second position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains R (but not in position 2) and does not contain A, I, S, or E.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain A, I, S, E (since they are not in the word).
- Must contain R (and we know it's not in position 2, so we should place R in a different position: 1, 3, 4, or 5).

Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and covering different positions.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We should avoid using any of the discarded letters: A, I, S, E.

Let's think of words that include R (in a position other than 2) and use other common letters.

Possible positions for R: we can try putting R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

To get more information, we might want to try a word that has R in a different position and includes other common consonants and vowels (but note: we know the word doesn't have A, I, E, so the vowels must be from O, U, and sometimes Y).

But note: the word might have other vowels like O or U.

Let me list some candidate words:

- Starting with R: words like ""ROUND"", ""ROBOT"", ""ROAST"" (but A and S are out, so not these). We cannot use A, I, S, E.

So, words without A, I, S, E and with R.

Possible words: 
- ""ROUTE"" -> but E is out, so no.
- ""ROUND"" -> no A, I, S, E? R, O, U, N, D -> yes, all allowed.
- ""CRONY"" -> C, R, O, N, Y -> no A, I, S, E -> allowed.
- ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> allowed.

But we also want to cover more common letters.

Another idea: since we know R is in the word, and we have to place it not in position 2, we can try position 1.

Let me try to form a word with R at the start and without the forbidden letters.

R at position 1: 
- R _ _ _ _

We need to fill the rest with letters not in {A, I, S, E} and that form a valid word.

Possible: 
- ROCKY (R, O, C, K, Y) -> but K and Y are less common? 
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) -> good, common letters.

But note: we also want to test other common consonants. We haven't tried T, N, L, etc.

Another candidate: ""ROTUND"" is 6 letters, too long.

""ROUND"" is 5 letters.

But we can also try R in position 3 or 4.

Alternatively, we might avoid putting R in position 1 because we don't know if it's there. We know it's not in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5.

To maximize information, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven't tested (like 1) and also introduces new common letters.

Let me think of words that have R and use common letters we haven't tried: like T, N, O, U, L, D, etc.

For example: 
- ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> R is in position 4? But we don't know if R is in 4. Also, no A, I, S, E -> valid.
- ""POUR"" is 4 letters, too short.
- ""GROUP"" -> G, R, O, U, P -> R is in position 2? But we cannot put R in position 2 because we already know it's not there? Actually, we can put R in position 2 again? But we know it's not in position 2, so it would be a waste of a position because we know it will be marked as '-' again? Actually, we can, but it doesn't give new information about the position of R. So it's better to try R in a new position.

So, we should avoid position 2 for R.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should place R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me list some words:

- R in position 1: ROUND, ROUTE (but E is out, so no), ROUTH (not common), ROUGH (U, G, H -> allowed), ROOMY (O, M, Y -> allowed, but two O's?).

But we don't know if the word has O or U.

Another: ""ROUGH"" -> R, O, U, G, H -> all allowed.

- R in position 3: We can try a word like ... R ... For example: ""CARRY"" -> but A is out, so no. ""BORED"" -> E is out. ""FURRY"" -> U, R, R, Y -> but we have two R's? The secret word might have two R's? We don't know. But we only know one R is present so far. But it could have two.

But we have to avoid A, I, S, E.

""BURLY"" -> B, U, R, L, Y -> allowed. R is in position 3.

- R in position 4: ""HORDE"" -> E is out. ""FORUM"" -> F, O, R, U, M -> allowed. R is in position 3? Let's count: F(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), M(5) -> so R is in position 3, not 4.

To have R in position 4: ""STARE"" -> but S and E are out. ""CHORE"" -> E out. ""LYRE"" is 4 letters. ""PURTY"" not a word. ""CURED"" -> E out. ""GOURD"" -> G, O, U, R, D -> R is in position 4? G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5) -> yes. And no A, I, S, E -> allowed.

- R in position 5: ""LATER"" -> E out. ""RUMOR"" -> R is in position 1 and 5? But we can use: ""RUMOR"" has R at 1 and 5, but we don't know if we can have two R's. Also, U, M, O -> allowed? But we have two R's. Alternatively, ""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> R at the end. Allowed.

But we want to cover more ground. We have only one known letter (R) and we know it's not in position 2.

I think a good strategy is to try R in a new position and also test other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (like T, N, L, etc.).

One classic second guess after ""ARISE"" with this feedback might be to try a word like ""ROUND"" or ""POUND"" (but POUND has no R). We need R.

So, let's go with ""ROUND"": 
- R in position 1 (which is new, we haven't tested position 1 for R)
- O, U, N, D are new letters.

But note: we are not sure if the word has O, U, N, D, but we are testing them.

Another candidate: ""COURT"" has R in position 3? C(1), O(2), U(3), R(4)? Wait, no: COURT is C-O-U-R-T, so positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:T -> so R is in position 4. And we haven't tested position 4 for R.

Also, COURT uses C, O, U, R, T -> all new letters (except R) and common.

But we don't have E, so it's valid.

Similarly, ""GROUP"": G(1), R(2), O(3), U(4), P(5) -> but R is in position 2, which we already know is wrong. So we would get '-' for R again, and we already know that. So it's better to avoid position 2 for R.

Therefore, avoid words with R in position 2.

So, ""COURT"" is good: R in position 4.

Another option: ""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> R in position 2? B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> position 2, which we want to avoid.

So not that.

""THORN"" -> T, H, O, R, N -> R in position 4? T(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> yes. And no A, I, S, E -> allowed.

But we also want to test U? Not necessarily.

I think ""COURT"" is a good choice because it tests C, O, U, T and R in a new position (4).

Alternatively, ""ROUND"" tests R, O, U, N, D with R in position 1.

Both are good.

But note: we have only one R, and we are testing it in a new position.

I'll go with ""ROUND"" because it tests R at position 1 and also includes common letters.

But let me check if ""ROUND"" is a valid word: yes.

So, my second guess: ROUND.

But wait, what if the secret word has R in position 1? Then we get a check. If not, we might get a minus for R and also learn about O, U, N, D.

Alternatively, if we use ""COURT"", we test R in position 4.

Since we don't have any information about position 1, it might be good to test R there.

I think either is fine.

I'll choose ""ROUND"".

But let me see: after ""arise"" with R being misplaced, and we know it's not in position 2, if we put R in position 1 and it's correct, that would be great. If not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.

So, I'll go with ""ROUND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""arise"":
- A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word (marked with 'x').
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (marked with '-').

For the second guess:
- The word must include R (in a position other than 2) and exclude A, I, S, E.
- To maximize information, I chose a word with R in position 1 (a new position to test) and introduced new common letters: O, U, N, D.
- ""round"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits these criteria and helps test for other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (N, D).

<guess>round</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: round -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess ""arise"":
  A: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, but wrong position; so R is not in position 2)
  I: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Second guess ""round"":
  R: - (in word, wrong position; so R is not in position 1 either, because we tried position 1 now and got '-')
  O: x (not in word)
  U: - (in word, wrong position; so U is in the word but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  D: x (not in word)

Now, we know:

Letters not in the word: A, I, S, E, O, N, D

Letters in the word: R and U

We also know the positions for R: it cannot be in position 1 (from ""round"") or position 2 (from ""arise""). So it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, U is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""round"").

We have used two guesses. We have four more.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R (in position 3, 4, or 5)
- Contains U (not in position 3)
- Does not contain A, I, S, E, O, N, D

Additionally, we can use other letters that haven't been tried yet.

The remaining letters (not tried and not excluded) are: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want to maximize information by covering new letters and different positions.

Also, we need to consider the positions for R and U.

Since R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and U must not be in 3, so U can be in 1,2,4,5. But note: we don't know the secret word, so U could be in any position but 3.

We can try to place R in one of the possible positions and U in another.

Let's list possible positions:

For R: 3,4,5
For U: 1,2,4,5

But note: if we put R and U in the same position? No, they are different letters.

We must avoid positions that we already know are wrong for these letters.

We haven't tested positions 4 and 5 for U, and positions 3,4,5 for R.

Possible words:

We need a word that has R in 3,4, or 5 and U somewhere else.

Since we don't know where U is, we can try to put U in a position we haven't tested. We have tested U in position 3 (got '-') and R in position 1 (got '-') and 2 (we didn't try? Wait, in ""arise"" R was in position 2 and got '-', so we know R is not in position 2). For U, only position 3 has been tried.

So we can try U in position 1,2,4,5.

Similarly for R, we have tried position 1 (in ""round"") and position 2 (in ""arise"") and both were '-', so R must be in 3,4, or 5.

Let us try to formulate words without the excluded letters and with R and U.

Excluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D

Available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also want common words to maximize the chance.

Try words with U and R.

Possible common letters: T, L, M, P, etc.

Words:

- If U is at position 1: then U _ _ R_ ? But we need to fill.

  U in 1, R in 4? Example: ""ULCER"" but E is excluded. ""ULTRA"" but A is excluded.

  ""ULTRA"" has A, which is out. No.

  ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E is excluded. No.

  ""UMPTY"" not a word.

  ""UNCUT"" has N and C? U, N, C, U, T? Wait, ""UNCUT"" has N (excluded) and U twice? Also N is excluded.

  We cannot use N.

  So, U in position 1: hard to find without excluded letters.

  Example: ""UPTURN"" too long.

  ""UTILE"" has E and I? U, T, I, L, E -> I and E excluded.

  Maybe ""UGLY"" too short?

  Let me think of common words: ""USURY"" has S? U, S, U, R, Y -> S is excluded.

  ""USURP"" -> U, S, U, R, P -> S excluded.

  Difficult with U at start.

- U at position 2: _ U _ _ _

  Then with R in position 3,4, or 5.

  Example: if R in 4: _ U _ R _

  Words: ""CURLY"" -> C, U, R, L, Y? But R is in position 3? Because C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5). But we want R in 4? Here R is in 3.

  We can have R in 3: so _ U R _ _

  Examples: ""BURMA"" but A excluded. ""BURQA"" not common. ""BURST"" has S excluded.

  ""CURVE"" -> C, U, R, V, E -> E excluded.

  ""CURVY"" -> C, U, R, V, Y -> and V and Y are allowed. But R is in position 3.

  But does it have excluded? Letters: C,U,R,V,Y -> no A,I,S,E,O,N,D -> acceptable.

  Also, it tests C, V, Y.

  Another: ""FURRY"" has two R's? F,U,R,R,Y -> but we don't know if R can be duplicated. But it might, so let's consider. However, we have R only once so far, but the secret word might have two R's? Yes, possible.

  But in ""curvy"", R is in position 3.

  Alternatively, if R in position 4: so _ U ? R _

  For example, ""GOURD"" but O excluded because in ""round"" O is x, so O not present.

  O is excluded? Yes, from ""round"": O(x), so O is not in the word.

  Similarly, in ""round"", O was guessed and marked x, so O is not in the word.

  So we must avoid O.

  ""GOURD"" has O? G,O,U,R,D -> O and D excluded.

  No.

  So for _ U _ R _, let's make a word: like ""PUTTY"" has U? P,U,T,T,Y -> but T,T. And R is missing? We need to have R.

  We need R in the word.

  So for U in 2, R in 4: we have pattern _ U ? R ? 

  Words: ""CURRY"" has R in 3 and 4? C,U,R,R,Y -> but position 3 is R and position 4 is R? Specifically: position 4 is R? No: C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) so yes R at position 4? Actually, the fourth letter is R. But we also have R at position 3? So ""CURRY"" has R at positions 3 and 4? It depends on the word.

  But we need only one R? Not necessarily.

  However, we know that R is present at least once. But it could be twice.

  But if we use two R's, we might get confused.

  Better to choose a word with U and R only once to avoid ambiguity.

  So, let's avoid duplicate letters for now.

  So, _ U ? R _ ? With no duplicates and no excluded letters.

  Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

  Suppose U in 2, R in 4: then positions:
  1: one of B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z
  2: U
  3: one of the available letters
  4: R
  5: one of the available letters

  Examples: 
  ""CURRY"" has two R's.
  ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> letters: M,U,R,K,Y -> all allowed? M, U, R, K, Y -> and no excluded? Yes. But R is in position 3? M(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). So R is in 3, not 4.

  If we want R in 4: so the letter in position 4 is R. So the letter after U must be the fourth? That is position 4.

  So the pattern: position 1: ?, 2: U, 3: some letter, 4: R, 5: ?

  Words: ""CURRY"" would have position 4 as R? In ""curry"": C(1),U(2),R(3),R(4) – wait, actually it's C(1),U(2),R(3),R(4) so position 4 is R.

  So ""CURRY"" works: U in 2 and R in 4? But in position 3 we also have R? So if the secret word has only one R, we might get multiple feedbacks.

  Another word: ""SURFY"" but S is excluded. ""HURRY"" has H,U,R,R,Y -> R at position 3 and 4? Similarly.

  ""LURCH"" -> L, U, R, C, H -> R is in position 3? L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)? Not 4.

  ""BURET"" has E? B,U,R,E,T -> E excluded.

  ""FUROR"" has O? F,U,R,O,R -> O excluded.

  ""PURTY"" not a word.

  ""MURTI"" not common.

  How about ""CURVY"" but R is in 3.

  Another word: ""BUYER"" has E? B,U,Y,E,R -> E excluded.

  This is challenging.

  Let's try U in position 4.

  Or perhaps U in position 5.

Let's try U in position 4: ... U

Pattern: ... U, so U in 4, and R in 3 or 5? Or in another position.

Position 4: U, then U cannot be in position 3 because we know U is not in 3, but 4 is fine.

Also R in 3,4,5? But if U in 4, and R in 4, same position? Not possible.

So R cannot be in 4 if U is there? But they are different letters.

U in 4, R in 3 or 5.

Similarly, U in 5: R in 3,4.

So let's pattern U in 4:

? ? ? U ?

With R somewhere.

If R in 3: ... then positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:R, 4:U, 5:?

But we need R in 3 and U in 4.

Words: ""TRUTH"" has T,R,U,T,H -> R at 2? T(1),R(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> not matching pattern.

""GRUMP"" -> G,R,U,M,P -> R in 2, U in 3? But U is in position 3, which we already know is not allowed for U (from ""round"", U was in position 3 and got '-')? No, wait: In ""round"", U was in position 3? Let me check ""round"": R(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> so U was in position 3 and got '-', meaning U is in the word but not in position 3. So we can try U in other positions, but not 3.

So for U in position 4: pattern _ _ R U ? or _ _ ? U R

If R in 3 and U in 4: then _ _ R U ?

Example: ""CHRUT"" not a word. ""FRUMP"" -> F,R,U,M,P -> but U is in 3? F(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5) -> not U in 4.

""TRUMUD"" too long.

""TRUMP"" -> T,R,U,M,P -> U in 3? T(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5) -> U in pos 3, not 4.

It's hard.

Perhaps U in position 5.

Pattern: ? ? ? ? U

With R in 3 or 4.

For example, R in 3: _ _ R ? U

Words: ""CARBU"" not a word.

""MARAU"" not a word.

Common word: ""THUMB"" but U is not at end. H is position? T,H,U,M,B -> U is 3.

""VAGUER"" too long.

Perhaps not common.

Since U is a vowel and we have few vowels left we can try, but the word must have U.

Another idea: use U in position 2 and R in position 5.

Pattern: _ U _ _ R

So U in 2, R in 5.

Words: ""QUOTER"" has O and E? Q,U,O,T,E,R -> O and E excluded.

""JUMAR"" not common.

""HUMIC"" not common.

""LUMBRICAL"" too long.

"" buy r"" not.

""PURER"" has E? P,U,R,E,R -> E excluded.

""PUFFR"" not a word.

""CURVY"" is C,U,R,V,Y -> U in 2, R in 3, Y in 4? C(1),U(2),R(3),V(4),Y(5) so R in 3.

But we can accept R in 3.

Perhaps ""curvy"" is a good option.

Similarly, ""BURMA"" has A but excluded.

I think ""CURVY"" is a valid word and it uses common letters.

It has:
- C: new
- U: at position 2? But in ""CURVY"", U is in position 2, which hasn't been tested yet.
- R: in position 3, which is a possible location for R.
- V: new
- Y: new

Also, avoids all excluded letters.

But what about U in position 2? We don't know if it is valid or not, but we are testing it.

Since we know U is not in position 3, but position 2 could be.

R in position 3 could be correct.

So ""curvy"" seems okay.

Another word: ""TRYST"" but no U.

We must include U and R.

""GLYPH"" no U.

I think ""curvy"" is fine.

But let's confirm the letters: C, U, R, V, Y -> all not excluded.

So let's go with ""CURVY"".

But in the pattern, U is in positions 2 and R in 3.

We haven't tested position 2 for U, so it might be correct or wrong.

If U is not in position 2, we'll get a '-' if it's elsewhere or 'x' if not present? But we know U is present, so if not in 2, we'll get '-' again.

Similarly for R, if in 3, we might get a check or minus.

Another possibility: ""HUMOR"" has O, excluded.

""LYTUR"" not a word.

So ""CURVY"" is acceptable.

Therefore, I'll guess ""CURVY"".Based on the feedback:

- Excluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D
- Must include: R and U
- R positions: must be in 3,4, or 5 (cannot be in 1 or 2 per previous guesses)
- U was tested in position 3 and was wrong, so must be in 1,2,4,5

Chose ""CURVY"": 
- Places R in position 3 to test if it is correct there
- Places U in position 2, a new position to test
- Introduces new common letters: C, V, Y
- Word is valid and avoids all excluded letters

<guess>curvy</guess>After the first guess ""arise"" revealed that R is in the word but not in position 2, and A, I, S, E are not in the word, the second guess ""round"" provided additional feedback: R is not in position 1, O is not in the word, U is in the word but not in position 3, and N and D are not in the word.

### Current Deductions:
1. **Excluded Letters**: A, I, S, E, O, N, D (from 'x' feedback).
2. **Confirmed Letters**: R and U must be in the word.
   - R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (must be in 3, 4, or 5).
   - U cannot be in position 3 (must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5).
3. **Available Letters**: All unused consonants and vowels: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- The word must include R (in position 3, 4, or 5) and U (in position 1, 2, 4, or 5), and exclude all eliminated letters.
- Prioritize testing R in a new, untested position (e.g., position 3) to narrow its location, as positions 1 and 2 are ruled out.
- Test U in a new position (e.g., position 2) since position 3 is invalid and position 1 hasn't been tested.
- Introduce new common letters like C, V, and Y to maximize information if they are incorrect or reveal positions.
- Avoid reused positions for R and U where possible to gain new data.
- ""Curvy"" fits these criteria:
  - U in position 2 (previously untested for U) to check if correct or misplaced.
  - R in position 3 (a potential valid position) to test for correctness.
  - Uses C, V, and Y, which are common and untested.
  - Valid word with no excluded letters.

This guess efficiently covers two possible positions for U and R while introducing three new letters to accelerate process of elimination.

<guess>curvy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: round -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: curvy -> FEEDBACK: C(x) U(✓) R(✓) V(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""arise"": A(x), R(-), I(x), S(x), E(x) → So R is in the word but not in position 2; A, I, S, E are not in the word.
2. ""round"": R(-), O(x), U(-), N(x), D(x) → So R is not in position 1 (since we got a minus), U is in the word but not in position 3; O, N, D are not in the word.
3. ""curvy"": C(x), U(✓), R(✓), V(x), Y(✓) → This gives us:
   - U is in the word and CORRECT position (position 3? Wait, let's see: in ""curvy"", the positions are: C(1), U(2), R(3), V(4), Y(5). So U is at position 2? But earlier feedback said U was not in position 3 from ""round"". But now U is at position 2 and got a check (✓), which means it is correct at position 2.

Correction: In ""curvy"":
- Position 1: C → x (not in word)
- Position 2: U → ✓ (correct letter and correct position)
- Position 3: R → ✓ (correct letter and correct position)
- Position 4: V → x (not in word)
- Position 5: Y → ✓ (correct letter and correct position)

Therefore, we know:
- U is in position 2, and it's correct.
- R is in position 3, and it's correct.
- Y is in position 5, and it's correct.
- C and V are not in the word.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we know:
- Excluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V (and others we found not present)
- Confirmed positions:
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: R
  Position 5: Y

So the secret word has the form: _ U R _ Y

We now need to find the first and fourth letters.

The missing positions: 1 and 4.

Letters we know:
- Must include U, R, Y (but already placed).
- We know the word has three letters fixed: U at 2, R at 3, Y at 5.
- The first and fourth positions need letters.

Excluded letters so far: from all feedbacks:
- Guess 1: A, I, S, E
- Guess 2: O, N, D
- Guess 3: C, V

So collectively excluded: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V

Therefore, available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z

But note: the word must be a 5-letter English word with pattern _ U R _ Y.

Possible words:
We need to try letters for position 1 and 4 from the available set.

Common words:
- BURPY? Not a word.
- PURPY? No.
- FURRY: F,U,R,R,Y? But Y is already at position 5? Pattern: F(1), U(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) → ""furry"" (which means covered with fur). Is it valid? But we have R at position 3 fixed, and if we put R at position 4, it might work. Also, check excluded: F and R? R is already used. Is R duplicated allowed? The secret word might have two R's? We know R is at position 3, but position 4 could be another R?

Feedback so far hasn't shown multiple R's, but it's possible.

Another word: ""HURRY"" which is similar: H,U,R,R,Y → same pattern H(1),U(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5).

But we don't know about duplicate letters.

Other possibilities without duplicates:
- ""LURGY""? Not a word.
- ""MURKY"" has K and Y? M,U,R,K,Y → but from guess 2, U was at position3? No, in this case: M(1),U(2),R(3),K(4),Y(5) → ""murky"". Valid? Yes. But we have to check if K is allowed? K is not excluded? Yes, available.

But in feedback from guess 2, we have U marked as '-' in position 3, but that doesn't affect K.

Similarly, ""TURFY""? Not common.

""JURY"" is 4 letters.

We need two letters: one for position 1 and one for position 4.

List words that fit _ U R _ Y:
- FURRY: F U R R Y
- HURRY: H U R R Y
- BURRY: B U R R Y? Not common, ""burry"" might be a variant but less common.
- CURRY: but C is excluded? Yes, guess3: C(x), so C not in word.
- PURRY? Not a word.
- SURRY? S excluded.
- LURRY? Not a word.
- MURKY: M U R K Y → valid word.
- GURRY? Not common.
- PURDY? P U R D Y → but D excluded? From guess2: D(x), so D not in word.
- TURFY: not standard.
- BURLY: B U R L Y → ""burly"" means strong. B(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5). Available letters: B and L not excluded.

Similarly, ""JUMBY""? Not fitting.

So possible words: 
- ""furry"" (if double R is allowed)
- ""hurry"" (double R)
- ""murky"" (no double)
- ""burly"" (no double)

We need to choose a guess that tests position 1 and 4.

We have guesses left: we have used 3, so 3 more tries.

We can try one of these words.

Let's pick one that uses common non-excluded letters.

We also want to maximize information, but since we have three positions only fixed and two to determine, we can guess a word that fits.

But note: if we guess a word with duplicate letters, and if it's wrong, we might not know about the fourth letter.

So perhaps a word without duplicate R is better to clarify the fourth position.

For example, ""burly"" would test B in position 1 and L in position 4.

Similarly, ""murky"" tests M and K.

Other words: ""turfy"" not common; ""purpy"" no.

How about ""jury"" is too short.

I think ""burly"" and ""murky"" are reasonable.

Another word: ""furzy"" not common.

""purty"" not standard.

I'll go with ""burly"" because B and L are common.

But we can also try ""murky"".

But let's see: the fourth letter could be R? As in ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

We don't know if the word has two R's.

To avoid duplication, let's try ""burly"".

So my guess: ""BURLY""

Feedback will tell us about B and L.

So, pattern is _ U R _ Y, with U,R,Y fixed.

We guess ""BURLY"".

If not, we have other options.

But let's do it.### Previous Feedback Analysis:
1. **Guess 1: arise**  
   - A(x), R(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)  
   → R is in the word but not in position 2. A, I, S, E are eliminated.  
2. **Guess 2: round**  
   - R(-), O(x), U(-), N(x), D(x)  
   → R is not in position 1, U is in the word but not in position 3. O, N, D are eliminated.  
3. **Guess 3: curvy**  
   - C(x), U(✓), R(✓), V(x), Y(✓)  
   → U is correct at position 2, R is correct at position 3, Y is correct at position 5. C and V are eliminated.  

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed Letters/Positions:**  
  - Position 2: U (correct)  
  - Position 3: R (correct)  
  - Position 5: Y (correct)  
- **Secret Word Pattern:** `_ U R _ Y`  
- **Eliminated Letters:** A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V  
- **Available Letters:** B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z  

### Strategy for Fourth Guess:
- The goal is to solve for positions 1 and 4 of the pattern `_ U R _ Y`.  
- Choose a valid English word that fits this pattern, prioritizing common letters to test possibilities:  
  - Position 1: Test B, F, H, L, M, T (common options).  
  - Position 4: Test G, L, K, M, T (to cover both positions with minimal duplication).  
- ""Burly"" was selected:  
  - B (new) tests position 1.  
  - L (new) tests position 4.  
- If incorrect, feedback on B and L will directly reduce possibilities for positions 1 and 4.  
- Common words fitting the pattern (e.g., ""hurry"", ""murky"", ""turfy"") will be tested based on feedback.

<guess>burly</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: round -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: curvy -> FEEDBACK: C(x) U(✓) R(✓) V(x) Y(✓)
Guess 4: burly -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from four guesses:

1. ""arise"": A(not in word), R(in word but wrong position), I(not), S(not), E(not)
2. ""round"": R(in word but wrong position), O(not), U(in word but wrong position), N(not), D(not)
3. ""curvy"": C(not), U(correct position), R(correct position), V(not), Y(correct position)
4. ""burly"": B(not), U(correct), R(correct), L(not), Y(correct)

From this, we know definitively:
- Positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed: Position 2 is U, Position 3 is R, Position 5 is Y.
- The secret word is of the form: ? U R ? Y
- Eliminated letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V, B, L (from 'x' feedback in various guesses)

Additionally, note that for Guess1: R was in position 2 but marked '-', which is consistent with our fixed position (now we know R is at position 3). Similarly, in Guess2 R was in position 1 (wrong) and U was in position 3 (wrong), but now we have U at 2 and R at 3.

Now, the remaining positions are 1 and 4. We need to fill in one letter at position 1 and one at position 4 from the letters not yet eliminated.

Available letters (not eliminated): F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z

But the word must be a valid English word. Pattern: _ U R _ Y

We need to find a word that fits ? U R ? Y, with both ? being from the available letters.

Possible words:
- FURRY: F U R R Y -> but R is duplicated? And position 4 would be R. Note that we haven't excluded R as a possibility for position 4? But wait, in ""curvy"" we only tested R at position 3 (which was correct) but not at position 4. So R could theoretically be at position 4? The secret word might have two R's? Yes. Because we only know of one R from the initial feedback, but it could appear twice. However, we haven't had feedback that directly contradicts it.
- HURRY: H U R R Y -> similarly.
- But let's see: in Guess4 we guessed L at position 4 and got 'x', meaning L is not in the word and specifically not at position 4.

Other possibilities beyond ""furry"" and ""hurry"": 
- MURKY: M U R K Y -> available letters: M and K are not excluded.
- TURFY: not common, and T is available.
- JURY is 4 letters.
- GURDY? Not common.
- PURDY: but D is eliminated? From Guess2 D(x), yes.
- BURLY was tried: B U R L Y -> B and L were eliminated.
- FURLY? Not common.

So: 
- FURRY: F and R (R duplicated) -> but R is already used? The fourth letter is R.
- HURRY: H and R.
- MURKY: M and K.

Which of these are valid? 
- ""furry"" (adj, covered with fur)
- ""hurry"" (verb, to rush)
- ""murky"" (adj, dark and gloomy)

Also ""curvy"" was tried but doesn't fit fourth letter.

We might have ""purry""? Not a word.

Or ""turvy"" as in ""topsy-turvy"", but not standalone.

So feasible words: ""furry"", ""hurry"", ""murky"".

Now, to choose one: 
- If we test ""murky"", we test M and K, and if incorrect, we know to look for words with duplicate R?
- But we have limited guesses (2 left after this).

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests a letter not duplicated? For example, ""murky"" has no duplicate letters.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate R or not.

Since we haven't tested any duplicate R scenarios, both are possible.

But note: in all previous guesses, we have not guessed a word with R duplicated, so we don't have direct feedback on whether there's a second R.

However, we know from ""curvy"": R was placed in position 3 and we got a check (so should be only one R? Not necessarily, because the feedback shows only if the letter is in the word and position. For example, if the word had two R's, and we guess one R in the correct position, we would still get a check? But if we guess R in a wrong position for the duplicate, we might get a '-'. But in ""curvy"", we didn't try to put R in another position.

Similarly, in other guesses.

But no feedback indicated a second R? Not directly. However, we know R is in the word, and no feedback negates the possibility of multiple R's.

So, to resolve, we could guess ""murky"" to test M and K without duplication. Then, if incorrect, we can guess ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

But if we guess ""murky"" and it's correct, we win. If not, we have one more guess.

Similarly, if we guess ""furry"", if correct we win; if not, we know the word must be ""hurry"" or another, but the only other option is ""hurry""? Or ""murky""?

We have two strong candidates: one with duplicate R and one without.

So we need to pick one.

But note: the pattern ? U R ? Y: 
- If position 4 is R, then word must be * U R R Y -> like ""furry"", ""hurry"".
- If position 4 is not R, then it's a different letter, like in ""murky"" (K).

Available letters for position 1: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z, but the word must be valid.

For position 4: from available letters, but not R? We can test with R or without.

Since we don't know, but we have to choose.

Practical approach: guess ""murky"" because it tests M and K, which are common, and if the feedback shows M or K not present, then we know the word must have R in position 4.

But let's simulate: if we guess ""murky"", and secret is ""furry"":
- Position1: M vs F -> x (M not in secret)
- Position2: U -> ✓ (correct)
- Position3: R -> ✓ (correct)
- Position4: K vs R -> ? Since in secret R is present, but not at position4? In ""furry"", position4 is R, so if secret is ""furry"", then K is not in the word and R is missing? Wait, no: the secret ""furry"" has positions: F(1), U(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). For guess ""murky"": M(1) -> should be x? Because F is at 1. U(2)✓, R(3)✓, then K(4): secret has R at position4, so K is not R -> x? But R is in the word? Yes, but we already accounted for R at position3? How is the feedback for duplicate letters? In Wordle rules: 
For a word with duplicate letters, see: 
If the secret has two R's and we guess one R correctly, and another R in the wrong position, we get - for the second R? But in this case, for ""murky"":
- M: not in secret -> x
- U: correct
- R: correct position -> ✓
- K: not in secret -> x
- Y: correct -> ✓
So feedback: M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)

But if secret is ""furry"", then K is not in the word? Yes, K is absent. So we get M(x), U(✓), R(✓), K(x), Y(✓). That doesn't reveal the fourth position.

But we would know that position4 is not K, but it doesn't tell us what it is.

We have used the guess showing M and K incorrect.

Then we still don't know if it's ""furry"" or ""hurry"", etc.

But we have only one guess left? So we need to test one of them.

But that was inefficient.

Alternatively, guess ""furry"": 
If secret is ""furry"", we win.
If secret is ""hurry"", we get: F at position1 vs H -> so F would be x? Because H is at 1 in ""hurry"". Then U✓, R✓, R✓ (because R is in secret twice, and we guessed it at position4? In secret ""hurry"": H(1),U(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5). Guess ""furry"": F(1),U(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5). Positions:
- F vs H: F not in secret? But secret has no F -> x? But is F present? Secret ""hurry"" has no F -> x for F.
- U✓
- R✓ (position3)
- R✓ (position4) because secret has R at position4? Yes? Since we guessed R at position4 and secret has R at position4, it should be check? ✓
- Y✓
So feedback: F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓) -> which shows that R is correct at position4, but we don't get the letter for position1.

But we see F is wrong, and position1 is incorrect.

But we know then that the secret word has R at position4? Because R4 is ✓? And also R3 is ✓? But we already knew R3.

So from this, we know position1 must be the one causing issue? And position4 is R.

But we have to guess again? Only if we don't win.

In this scenario, after ""furry"", we see that F is incorrect? And we have to try HURRY for position1? But then we have one guess.

But if we guess ""furry"" and secret is ""furry"", we win.

If secret is ""hurry"", we get feedback F(x) ... and R at 4✓, so we know the pattern is ? U R R Y, and we know position1 must be not F? So we can guess ""hurry"" next? And we win? Given we have tries left.

But similarly for ""murky"".

But to solve faster, we should guess a word that distinguishes the possibilities.

Since we are running out of guesses, let’s list the possible words we can form with pattern.

Possible words: 
With duplicate R: FURRY, HURRY
Without duplicate R: MURKY (and perhaps others? Like ... TURGY? Not common. PURRY? No.)

But ""murky"" is likely the only common one without duplicate R.

Also, ""gurly"" not common.

Therefore, we have three candidates: ""furry"", ""hurry"", ""murky"".

With two guesses left, we can choose one arbitrarily.

But note: from Guess4 ""burly"", we guessed L at position4 and got x, so position4 cannot be L? And not B at position1? But we already knew that.

Similarly, available letters for position4: from available, but to form word.

Perhaps guess ""murky"" to test if it's not duplicated R? Then if ""murky"" is correct, done? If not, then duplicate R must be in the word? So then we guess ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

But which one?

We don't have information to distinguish ""furry"" and ""hurry"".

So we have to guess arbitrarily.

Therefore, to maximize commonality? Or reduce options.

Since we have to choose, let's pick ""murky"" first? Or directly the duplicate R word.

But let me check if there are more words: 
- ""jumpy""? No pattern, must be J U R P Y? Not standard. J U M P Y -> no R fixed.
- The word must have U R R Y pattern? Or U R K Y? Etc.

Another word: ""turfy"" might be accepted? T U R F Y -> but F in position4? And T in 1? Not common.

Similarly, ""purty"" not.

So three options: furry, hurry, murky.

Let us guess ""furry"".

Why? Because it might win immediately if correct? But then if not, we know to try ""hurry"" or ""murky"" next? And we have one guess left? But if we guess ""furry"" and it's ""hurry"", we get feedback that F is wrong? Then we can guess ""hurry"" for the fifth guess? And if ""murky"", we lose.

Similarly, if we guess ""murky"" and it's not, we know to guess a duplicate R word? Then we can guess ""hurry"" for fifth? But we don't know if ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

Therefore, we need a guess that covers the first letter possibilities.

But we can't avoid guessing one of them.

Since no guess gives all information, we should pick one arbitrarily.

Let me pick ""hurry"" because H is a common letter? Or ""murky"" to avoid assumption on duplication.

Another idea: is there a word that fits the pattern with a letter we haven't tried? Such as ""purry""? Not valid.

Really, ""furry"", ""hurry"", ""murky"" seem the main words.

I think ""murky"" is a good choice to test if there is a double R or not.

If we guess ""murky"":

- If it's correct: we win.
- If not, then the word must have double R? So for the fifth guess, we guess ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

But which one? We still don't know.

After guessing ""murky"" and getting e.g. M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓), feedback:

- Position1: unknown, but M is wrong? So if not ""murky"", then position4 must be R? Because we know U, R, Y are in place, so the word must be * U R R Y where * can be F or H or others? P et c, but common are F or H.

But we have not tested F or H? So we have to guess between furry and hurry? Or check the dictionary.

So for fifth guess, we can guess ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

But with no additional info.

Therefore, guessing ""murky"" first doesn't resolve position1.

Similarly, if we guess ""furry"" and it's not, we know to guess ""hurry"" for position1? Or if not ""hurry"", then ""murky"" must be if not? But if ""furry"" is not and secret is ""murky"", then after ""furry"" feedback: F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓) -> wait for position4 we got ✓? But if secret is ""murky"", which has no R at position4? Then feedback on ""furry"" vs secret ""murky"":
- Position1: F vs M -> F not in secret? x
- Position2: U✓
- Position3: R✓
- Position4: R vs K? Secret position4 has K? So R is not in position4? But secret has only one R? At position3? So when we guess R at position4, secret does not have R at position4? And we have already used the only R? So R at position4: since secret has no second R? Then feedback: R is not in the word? But we have a ✓ at position3? It should be specific per position. For position4: since K is at position4 in secret? We guess R, which is not in secret? But secret has R only at position3? And we already marked R at position3 as ✓? So for position4? R is not in position4 and also not present elsewhere? But we know R is in the word? Therefore, position4 guess R: letter is in the word? No additional? Only if not account duplicates, R is present but not at position4? So it should be '-', because R is in the word? Or 'x' if no additional R?

This depends on the implementation, but typically, if the secret has one R and we guess two R's, one at correct and one at wrong position, the one at correct gets ✓, the one at wrong position gets '-' if there is only one occurrence? Or x if the guess has extra.

But most Wordle: 
- For duplicate letter feedback: it marks greens first, then yellows for the correct letters in wrong positions.

Example: secret SKILL, guess KILLS:
- First letter K vs SKILL: K is not at position1? So is K in the word? Yes, so mark '-' but for our case:

Secret: M U R K Y ? Or F U R R Y?

Suppose secret is ""murky"": only one R at position3.

Guess ""furry"": positions: 
- F: not in secret -> x? Specifically: letter F absent? x
- U: correct and position? U✓
- R: correct position? position3 R ✓? Position3: secret has R, guess has R? ✓? Position4: guess has R? Secret has K? So R at position4: is R present elsewhere? No, secret has only one R at position3? Which we already matched? So for position4, R is not in the secret? So it should be x? Because no additional R.

Similarly in Wordle: secret ""caulk"", guess ""fauna"": first A at position2 is ✓? But second A at position5; secret has no second A? So position5 A: x? Because the duplicate exceeded actual count.

So similarly: for guess ""furry"" against secret ""murky"":
- Position1: F not in secret? x
- Position2: U✓
- Position3: R✓
- Position4: R? But secret has only one R? Already counted? So no remaining R? Therefore R not present? So x? And Y✓ 
- So feedback: F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(x) Y(✓) -> note: the second R at position4 is x.

In feedback format: ✓ for U,R,Y? And x for F and the second R.

Similarly, if secret is ""furry"": guess ""murky"" gives M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)

So to differentiate: 
- If we guess ""murky"" and secret is ""furry"", we get M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓? But Y is position5? In ""murky"" Y is position5, in ""furry"" Y position5? So Y should be ✓? So yes: M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)
- Similarly, secret ""hurry"" guess ""murky"": same.

And secret ""murky"" guess ""furry"": as above.

In addition, guess ""furry"" against ""hurry"": 
- Position1: F vs H? Secret has H? So F is not in secret -> x? But secret has H, which is not F? So F absent? x
- U✓, R✓, R✓ (because secret has R at position4), Y✓ -> feedback F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)

In this case, position4 got ✓.

Similarly, guess ""hurry"" against ""furry"": H(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)

So only position1 is different.

Therefore, after any guess, we can tell.

Given this, with two guesses left, we can choose any one.

I think the safest is to guess ""murky"" first? Because if it's correct, done? If not, then the secret must be one of the duplicate R words? And we have one guess left? So we can guess ""furry"" or ""hurry""? But which one? We have no info on F and H.

For example, if we guess ""murky"" and it's not correct? Then we have to guess either ""furry"" or ""hurry"".

But we don't know which one? We may lose.

Similarly, if we guess ""furry"" and it's not correct, then if secret is ""hurry"", we get P1 F x and P4 R ✓, so we know to guess ""hurry"" next? But if secret is ""murky"", we get P1 F x, P4 R x, so we know to .ot ""murky"" next? But we have only one more guess.

After guess ""furry"" with secret ""murky"", we get:
 F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(x) Y(✓)

 From this, we know:
- U,R,Y fixed.
- Position1: not F? And not any excluded letter.
- Position4: not R (because we guessed R and got x? But why x? Because no extra R? So position4 has a letter that is not R and not F (since F not in word)? Also not in available.

But we also know position4 is not R? Because feedbackx means it's not the letter? So position4 has some other letter? Not R? But in ""murky"", it's K.

So from feedback R(x) at position4, we know position4 is not R? And also K is present in secret? But not? In this feedback, we only got R(x) at position4? But we don't know what is at position4 except it's not R.

Then for next guess? We need to guess a word with pattern ? U R ? Y, with position4 not R and not L,et c? So we try ""murky""? Which has M and K? But we don't know K.

It's messy.

Therefore, with multiple options, we need to guess one of the three.

I think the most common word among the three is ""hurry"" or ""furry"" or ""murky"".

But from usage, ""hurry"" is common.

Otherwise, ""murky"".

So let’s guess ""hurry"".

Then if correct, win? If not, but secret is ""furry"", we get feedback? Then fifth guess ""furry"" if not.

Similarly, if secret is ""murky"", after guess ""hurry"" vs ""murky"": 
- H(1) vs M -> H not in secret? x
- U✓
- R✓
- R: position4 R vs secret K? But secret has only one R? So R at position4: since secret has no extra R? So x? Or we could say?

Secret ""murky"" guess ""hurry"":
- H position1: not in secret? x
- U✓
- R position3: ✓
- R position4: secret has K? And only one R already counted? So extra R not in secret? x
- Y✓

So feedback: H(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(x) Y(✓)

Then we know position4 is not R? And not H? So then we can guess ""murky"" for position1 M and position4 K? And win.

Similarly, if secret is ""furry"": guess ""hurry"" would give  H position1 vs F? Secret has F at1? H not F? So H absent? x, then U✓, R✓, R✓, Y✓? So feedback H(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓) -> then we know position4 is R? But position1 is wrong? So we guess ""furry"" next.

So in both cases, with one more guess, we can solve it.

Therefore, I will guess ""hurry"" now.

If not, we have one guess to correct.

So choice: ""HURRY""Based on the pattern _ U R _ Y and eliminated letters:
- Must fill positions 1 and 4.
- Eliminated letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V, B, L (from all 'x' feedback).
- Available letters for positions 1/4: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z.

Possible common words fitting pattern:
- ""furry"" (F in 1, R in 4)  
- ""hurry"" (H in 1, R in 4)  
- ""murky"" (M in 1, K in 4)  

### Reasoning:  
- ""Hurry"" is chosen for the 4th guess:  
  - Tests H at position 1 and R at position 4. 
- If correct, the game ends.  
- If incorrect, feedback will:  
  - Confirm if position 4 is R (✓ or -/x) or not.  
  - Reveal if position 1 is viable.  

With multiple candidates, ""hurry"" maximizes commonality and leaves one guess to resolve.  

<guess>hurry</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

- **Positions 2, 3, and 5** are confirmed as U, R, and Y respectively.  
- The secret word pattern is: `_ U R _ Y`.  
- **Eliminated letters (A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V, B, L)** reduce the possible letters for positions 1 and 4 to: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z.  
- Common valid words fitting the pattern are ""furry"" (F U R R Y), ""hurry"" (H U R R Y), and ""murky"" (M U R K Y).  

For the fourth guess, ""hurry"" is selected to test:  
- H at position 1 (possibly correct).  
- R at position 4 (revealing if duplication exists).  

If incorrect, feedback on H and the second R (position 4) will narrow down to ""furry"" or ""murky"" for the next guess.

We cannot use A, I, S, E.\n\nSo, words without A, I, S, E and with R.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""ROUTE"" -> but E is out, so no.\n- ""ROUND"" -> no A, I, S, E? R, O, U, N, D -> yes, all allowed.\n- ""CRONY"" -> C, R, O, N, Y -> no A, I, S, E -> allowed.\n- ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> allowed.\n\nBut we also want to cover more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we know R is in the word, and we have to place it not in position 2, we can try position 1.\n\nLet me try to form a word with R at the start and without the forbidden letters.\n\nR at position 1: \n- R _ _ _ _\n\nWe need to fill the rest with letters not in {A, I, S, E} and that form a valid word.\n\nPossible: \n- ROCKY (R, O, C, K, Y) -> but K and Y are less common? \n- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) -> good, common letters.\n\nBut note: we also want to test other common consonants. We haven\'t tried T, N, L, etc.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ROTUND"" is 6 letters, too long.\n\n""ROUND"" is 5 letters.\n\nBut we can also try R in position 3 or 4.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid putting R in position 1 because we don\'t know if it\'s there. We know it\'s not in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5.\n\nTo maximize information, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven\'t tested (like 1) and also introduces new common letters.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and use common letters we haven\'t tried: like T, N, O, U, L, D, etc.\n\nFor example: \n- ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> R is in position 4? But we don\'t know if R is in 4. Also, no A, I, S, E -> valid.\n- ""POUR"" is 4 letters, too short.\n- ""GROUP"" -> G, R, O, U, P -> R is in position 2? But we cannot put R in position 2 because we already know it\'s not there? Actually, we can put R in position 2 again? But we know it\'s not in position 2, so it would be a waste of a position because we know it will be marked as \'-\' again? Actually, we can, but it doesn\'t give new information about the position of R. So it\'s better to try R in a new position.\n\nSo, we should avoid position 2 for R.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess, we should place R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nLet me list some words:\n\n- R in position 1: ROUND, ROUTE (but E is out, so no), ROUTH (not common), ROUGH (U, G, H -> allowed), ROOMY (O, M, Y -> allowed, but two O\'s?).\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has O or U.\n\nAnother: ""ROUGH"" -> R, O, U, G, H -> all allowed.\n\n- R in position 3: We can try a word like ... R ... For example: ""CARRY"" -> but A is out, so no. ""BORED"" -> E is out. ""FURRY"" -> U, R, R, Y -> but we have two R\'s? The secret word might have two R\'s? We don\'t know. But we only know one R is present so far. But it could have two.\n\nBut we have to avoid A, I, S, E.\n\n""BURLY"" -> B, U, R, L, Y -> allowed. R is in position 3.\n\n- R in position 4: ""HORDE"" -> E is out. ""FORUM"" -> F, O, R, U, M -> allowed. R is in position 3? Let\'s count: F(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), M(5) -> so R is in position 3, not 4.\n\nTo have R in position 4: ""STARE"" -> but S and E are out. ""CHORE"" -> E out. ""LYRE"" is 4 letters. ""PURTY"" not a word. ""CURED"" -> E out. ""GOURD"" -> G, O, U, R, D -> R is in position 4? G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5) -> yes. And no A, I, S, E -> allowed.\n\n- R in position 5: ""LATER"" -> E out. ""RUMOR"" -> R is in position 1 and 5? But we can use: ""RUMOR"" has R at 1 and 5, but we don\'t know if we can have two R\'s. Also, U, M, O -> allowed? But we have two R\'s. Alternatively, ""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> R at the end. Allowed.\n\nBut we want to cover more ground. We have only one known letter (R) and we know it\'s not in position 2.\n\nI think a good strategy is to try R in a new position and also test other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (like T, N, L, etc.).\n\nOne classic second guess after ""ARISE"" with this feedback might be to try a word like ""ROUND"" or ""POUND"" (but POUND has no R). We need R.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""ROUND"": \n- R in position 1 (which is new, we haven\'t tested position 1 for R)\n- O, U, N, D are new letters.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has O, U, N, D, but we are testing them.\n\nAnother candidate: ""COURT"" has R in position 3? C(1), O(2), U(3), R(4)? Wait, no: COURT is C-O-U-R-T, so positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:T -> so R is in position 4. And we haven\'t tested position 4 for R.\n\nAlso, COURT uses C, O, U, R, T -> all new letters (except R) and common.\n\nBut we don\'t have E, so it\'s valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""GROUP"": G(1), R(2), O(3), U(4), P(5) -> but R is in position 2, which we already know is wrong. So we would get \'-\' for R again, and we already know that. So it\'s better to avoid position 2 for R.\n\nTherefore, avoid words with R in position 2.\n\nSo, ""COURT"" is good: R in position 4.\n\nAnother option: ""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> R in position 2? B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> position 2, which we want to avoid.\n\nSo not that.\n\n""THORN"" -> T, H, O, R, N -> R in position 4? T(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), N(5) -> yes. And no A, I, S, E -> allowed.\n\nBut we also want to test U? Not necessarily.\n\nI think ""COURT"" is a good choice because it tests C, O, U, T and R in a new position (4).\n\nAlternatively, ""ROUND"" tests R, O, U, N, D with R in position 1.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nBut note: we have only one R, and we are testing it in a new position.\n\nI\'ll go with ""ROUND"" because it tests R at position 1 and also includes common letters.\n\nBut let me check if ""ROUND"" is a valid word: yes.\n\nSo, my second guess: ROUND.\n\nBut wait, what if the secret word has R in position 1? Then we get a check. If not, we might get a minus for R and also learn about O, U, N, D.\n\nAlternatively, if we use ""COURT"", we test R in position 4.\n\nSince we don\'t have any information about position 1, it might be good to test R there.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nI\'ll choose ""ROUND"".\n\nBut let me see: after ""arise"" with R being misplaced, and we know it\'s not in position 2, if we put R in position 1 and it\'s correct, that would be great. If not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""ROUND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""arise"":\n- A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word (marked with \'x\').\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (marked with \'-\').\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include R (in a position other than 2) and exclude A, I, S, E.\n- To maximize information, I chose a word with R in position 1 (a new position to test) and introduced new common letters: O, U, N, D.\n- ""round"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits these criteria and helps test for other common vowels (O, U) and consonants (N, D).\n\n<guess>round</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: round -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess ""arise"":\n  A: x (not in word)\n  R: - (in word, but wrong position; so R is not in position 2)\n  I: x (not in word)\n  S: x (not in word)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nSecond guess ""round"":\n  R: - (in word, wrong position; so R is not in position 1 either, because we tried position 1 now and got \'-\')\n  O: x (not in word)\n  U: - (in word, wrong position; so U is in the word but not in position 3)\n  N: x (not in word)\n  D: x (not in word)\n\nNow, we know:\n\nLetters not in the word: A, I, S, E, O, N, D\n\nLetters in the word: R and U\n\nWe also know the positions for R: it cannot be in position 1 (from ""round"") or position 2 (from ""arise""). So it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, U is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""round"").\n\nWe have used two guesses. We have four more.\n\nWe need to form a new 5-letter word that:\n- Contains R (in position 3, 4, or 5)\n- Contains U (not in position 3)\n- Does not contain A, I, S, E, O, N, D\n\nAdditionally, we can use other letters that haven\'t been tried yet.\n\nThe remaining letters (not tried and not excluded) are: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe want to maximize information by covering new letters and different positions.\n\nAlso, we need to consider the positions for R and U.\n\nSince R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and U must not be in 3, so U can be in 1,2,4,5. But note: we don\'t know the secret word, so U could be in any position but 3.\n\nWe can try to place R in one of the possible positions and U in another.\n\nLet\'s list possible positions:\n\nFor R: 3,4,5\nFor U: 1,2,4,5\n\nBut note: if we put R and U in the same position? No, they are different letters.\n\nWe must avoid positions that we already know are wrong for these letters.\n\nWe haven\'t tested positions 4 and 5 for U, and positions 3,4,5 for R.\n\nPossible words:\n\nWe need a word that has R in 3,4, or 5 and U somewhere else.\n\nSince we don\'t know where U is, we can try to put U in a position we haven\'t tested. We have tested U in position 3 (got \'-\') and R in position 1 (got \'-\') and 2 (we didn\'t try? Wait, in ""arise"" R was in position 2 and got \'-\', so we know R is not in position 2). For U, only position 3 has been tried.\n\nSo we can try U in position 1,2,4,5.\n\nSimilarly for R, we have tried position 1 (in ""round"") and position 2 (in ""arise"") and both were \'-\', so R must be in 3,4, or 5.\n\nLet us try to formulate words without the excluded letters and with R and U.\n\nExcluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D\n\nAvailable: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe also want common words to maximize the chance.\n\nTry words with U and R.\n\nPossible common letters: T, L, M, P, etc.\n\nWords:\n\n- If U is at position 1: then U _ _ R_ ? But we need to fill.\n\n  U in 1, R in 4? Example: ""ULCER"" but E is excluded. ""ULTRA"" but A is excluded.\n\n  ""ULTRA"" has A, which is out. No.\n\n  ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E is excluded. No.\n\n  ""UMPTY"" not a word.\n\n  ""UNCUT"" has N and C? U, N, C, U, T? Wait, ""UNCUT"" has N (excluded) and U twice? Also N is excluded.\n\n  We cannot use N.\n\n  So, U in position 1: hard to find without excluded letters.\n\n  Example: ""UPTURN"" too long.\n\n  ""UTILE"" has E and I? U, T, I, L, E -> I and E excluded.\n\n  Maybe ""UGLY"" too short?\n\n  Let me think of common words: ""USURY"" has S? U, S, U, R, Y -> S is excluded.\n\n  ""USURP"" -> U, S, U, R, P -> S excluded.\n\n  Difficult with U at start.\n\n- U at position 2: _ U _ _ _\n\n  Then with R in position 3,4, or 5.\n\n  Example: if R in 4: _ U _ R _\n\n  Words: ""CURLY"" -> C, U, R, L, Y? But R is in position 3? Because C(1), U(2), R(3), L(4), Y(5). But we want R in 4? Here R is in 3.\n\n  We can have R in 3: so _ U R _ _\n\n  Examples: ""BURMA"" but A excluded. ""BURQA"" not common. ""BURST"" has S excluded.\n\n  ""CURVE"" -> C, U, R, V, E -> E excluded.\n\n  ""CURVY"" -> C, U, R, V, Y -> and V and Y are allowed. But R is in position 3.\n\n  But does it have excluded? Letters: C,U,R,V,Y -> no A,I,S,E,O,N,D -> acceptable.\n\n  Also, it tests C, V, Y.\n\n  Another: ""FURRY"" has two R\'s? F,U,R,R,Y -> but we don\'t know if R can be duplicated. But it might, so let\'s consider. However, we have R only once so far, but the secret word might have two R\'s? Yes, possible.\n\n  But in ""curvy"", R is in position 3.\n\n  Alternatively, if R in position 4: so _ U ? R _\n\n  For example, ""GOURD"" but O excluded because in ""round"" O is x, so O not present.\n\n  O is excluded? Yes, from ""round"": O(x), so O is not in the word.\n\n  Similarly, in ""round"", O was guessed and marked x, so O is not in the word.\n\n  So we must avoid O.\n\n  ""GOURD"" has O? G,O,U,R,D -> O and D excluded.\n\n  No.\n\n  So for _ U _ R _, let\'s make a word: like ""PUTTY"" has U? P,U,T,T,Y -> but T,T. And R is missing? We need to have R.\n\n  We need R in the word.\n\n  So for U in 2, R in 4: we have pattern _ U ? R ? \n\n  Words: ""CURRY"" has R in 3 and 4? C,U,R,R,Y -> but position 3 is R and position 4 is R? Specifically: position 4 is R? No: C(1), U(2), R(3), R(4) so yes R at position 4? Actually, the fourth letter is R. But we also have R at position 3? So ""CURRY"" has R at positions 3 and 4? It depends on the word.\n\n  But we need only one R? Not necessarily.\n\n  However, we know that R is present at least once. But it could be twice.\n\n  But if we use two R\'s, we might get confused.\n\n  Better to choose a word with U and R only once to avoid ambiguity.\n\n  So, let\'s avoid duplicate letters for now.\n\n  So, _ U ? R _ ? With no duplicates and no excluded letters.\n\n  Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\n  Suppose U in 2, R in 4: then positions:\n  1: one of B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z\n  2: U\n  3: one of the available letters\n  4: R\n  5: one of the available letters\n\n  Examples: \n  ""CURRY"" has two R\'s.\n  ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> letters: M,U,R,K,Y -> all allowed? M, U, R, K, Y -> and no excluded? Yes. But R is in position 3? M(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). So R is in 3, not 4.\n\n  If we want R in 4: so the letter in position 4 is R. So the letter after U must be the fourth? That is position 4.\n\n  So the pattern: position 1: ?, 2: U, 3: some letter, 4: R, 5: ?\n\n  Words: ""CURRY"" would have position 4 as R? In ""curry"": C(1),U(2),R(3),R(4) – wait, actually it\'s C(1),U(2),R(3),R(4) so position 4 is R.\n\n  So ""CURRY"" works: U in 2 and R in 4? But in position 3 we also have R? So if the secret word has only one R, we might get multiple feedbacks.\n\n  Another word: ""SURFY"" but S is excluded. ""HURRY"" has H,U,R,R,Y -> R at position 3 and 4? Similarly.\n\n  ""LURCH"" -> L, U, R, C, H -> R is in position 3? L(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), H(5)? Not 4.\n\n  ""BURET"" has E? B,U,R,E,T -> E excluded.\n\n  ""FUROR"" has O? F,U,R,O,R -> O excluded.\n\n  ""PURTY"" not a word.\n\n  ""MURTI"" not common.\n\n  How about ""CURVY"" but R is in 3.\n\n  Another word: ""BUYER"" has E? B,U,Y,E,R -> E excluded.\n\n  This is challenging.\n\n  Let\'s try U in position 4.\n\n  Or perhaps U in position 5.\n\nLet\'s try U in position 4: ... U\n\nPattern: ... U, so U in 4, and R in 3 or 5? Or in another position.\n\nPosition 4: U, then U cannot be in position 3 because we know U is not in 3, but 4 is fine.\n\nAlso R in 3,4,5? But if U in 4, and R in 4, same position? Not possible.\n\nSo R cannot be in 4 if U is there? But they are different letters.\n\nU in 4, R in 3 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, U in 5: R in 3,4.\n\nSo let\'s pattern U in 4:\n\n? ? ? U ?\n\nWith R somewhere.\n\nIf R in 3: ... then positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:R, 4:U, 5:?\n\nBut we need R in 3 and U in 4.\n\nWords: ""TRUTH"" has T,R,U,T,H -> R at 2? T(1),R(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> not matching pattern.\n\n""GRUMP"" -> G,R,U,M,P -> R in 2, U in 3? But U is in position 3, which we already know is not allowed for U (from ""round"", U was in position 3 and got \'-\')? No, wait: In ""round"", U was in position 3? Let me check ""round"": R(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> so U was in position 3 and got \'-\', meaning U is in the word but not in position 3. So we can try U in other positions, but not 3.\n\nSo for U in position 4: pattern _ _ R U ? or _ _ ? U R\n\nIf R in 3 and U in 4: then _ _ R U ?\n\nExample: ""CHRUT"" not a word. ""FRUMP"" -> F,R,U,M,P -> but U is in 3? F(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5) -> not U in 4.\n\n""TRUMUD"" too long.\n\n""TRUMP"" -> T,R,U,M,P -> U in 3? T(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5) -> U in pos 3, not 4.\n\nIt\'s hard.\n\nPerhaps U in position 5.\n\nPattern: ? ? ? ? U\n\nWith R in 3 or 4.\n\nFor example, R in 3: _ _ R ? U\n\nWords: ""CARBU"" not a word.\n\n""MARAU"" not a word.\n\nCommon word: ""THUMB"" but U is not at end. H is position? T,H,U,M,B -> U is 3.\n\n""VAGUER"" too long.\n\nPerhaps not common.\n\nSince U is a vowel and we have few vowels left we can try, but the word must have U.\n\nAnother idea: use U in position 2 and R in position 5.\n\nPattern: _ U _ _ R\n\nSo U in 2, R in 5.\n\nWords: ""QUOTER"" has O and E? Q,U,O,T,E,R -> O and E excluded.\n\n""JUMAR"" not common.\n\n""HUMIC"" not common.\n\n""LUMBRICAL"" too long.\n\n"" buy r"" not.\n\n""PURER"" has E? P,U,R,E,R -> E excluded.\n\n""PUFFR"" not a word.\n\n""CURVY"" is C,U,R,V,Y -> U in 2, R in 3, Y in 4? C(1),U(2),R(3),V(4),Y(5) so R in 3.\n\nBut we can accept R in 3.\n\nPerhaps ""curvy"" is a good option.\n\nSimilarly, ""BURMA"" has A but excluded.\n\nI think ""CURVY"" is a valid word and it uses common letters.\n\nIt has:\n- C: new\n- U: at position 2? But in ""CURVY"", U is in position 2, which hasn\'t been tested yet.\n- R: in position 3, which is a possible location for R.\n- V: new\n- Y: new\n\nAlso, avoids all excluded letters.\n\nBut what about U in position 2? We don\'t know if it is valid or not, but we are testing it.\n\nSince we know U is not in position 3, but position 2 could be.\n\nR in position 3 could be correct.\n\nSo ""curvy"" seems okay.\n\nAnother word: ""TRYST"" but no U.\n\nWe must include U and R.\n\n""GLYPH"" no U.\n\nI think ""curvy"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: C, U, R, V, Y -> all not excluded.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""CURVY"".\n\nBut in the pattern, U is in positions 2 and R in 3.\n\nWe haven\'t tested position 2 for U, so it might be correct or wrong.\n\nIf U is not in position 2, we\'ll get a \'-\' if it\'s elsewhere or \'x\' if not present? But we know U is present, so if not in 2, we\'ll get \'-\' again.\n\nSimilarly for R, if in 3, we might get a check or minus.\n\nAnother possibility: ""HUMOR"" has O, excluded.\n\n""LYTUR"" not a word.\n\nSo ""CURVY"" is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""CURVY"".Based on the feedback:\n\n- Excluded letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D\n- Must include: R and U\n- R positions: must be in 3,4, or 5 (cannot be in 1 or 2 per previous guesses)\n- U was tested in position 3 and was wrong, so must be in 1,2,4,5\n\nChose ""CURVY"": \n- Places R in position 3 to test if it is correct there\n- Places U in position 2, a new position to test\n- Introduces new common letters: C, V, Y\n- Word is valid and avoids all excluded letters\n\n<guess>curvy</guess>After the first guess ""arise"" revealed that R is in the word but not in position 2, and A, I, S, E are not in the word, the second guess ""round"" provided additional feedback: R is not in position 1, O is not in the word, U is in the word but not in position 3, and N and D are not in the word.\n\n### Current Deductions:\n1. **Excluded Letters**: A, I, S, E, O, N, D (from \'x\' feedback).\n2. **Confirmed Letters**: R and U must be in the word.\n   - R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (must be in 3, 4, or 5).\n   - U cannot be in position 3 (must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n3. **Available Letters**: All unused consonants and vowels: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n### Strategy for Third Guess:\n- The word must include R (in position 3, 4, or 5) and U (in position 1, 2, 4, or 5), and exclude all eliminated letters.\n- Prioritize testing R in a new, untested position (e.g., position 3) to narrow its location, as positions 1 and 2 are ruled out.\n- Test U in a new position (e.g., position 2) since position 3 is invalid and position 1 hasn\'t been tested.\n- Introduce new common letters like C, V, and Y to maximize information if they are incorrect or reveal positions.\n- Avoid reused positions for R and U where possible to gain new data.\n- ""Curvy"" fits these criteria:\n  - U in position 2 (previously untested for U) to check if correct or misplaced.\n  - R in position 3 (a potential valid position) to test for correctness.\n  - Uses C, V, and Y, which are common and untested.\n  - Valid word with no excluded letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently covers two possible positions for U and R while introducing three new letters to accelerate process of elimination.\n\n<guess>curvy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: round -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: curvy -> FEEDBACK: C(x) U(✓) R(✓) V(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\n1.

A, I, S, E are eliminated.  \n2. **Guess 2: round**  \n   - R(-), O(x), U(-), N(x), D(x)  \n   → R is not in position 1, U is in the word but not in position 3. O, N, D are eliminated.  \n3. **Guess 3: curvy**  \n   - C(x), U(✓), R(✓), V(x), Y(✓)  \n   → U is correct at position 2, R is correct at position 3, Y is correct at position 5. C and V are eliminated.  \n\n### Deductions:\n- **Confirmed Letters/Positions:**  \n  - Position 2: U (correct)  \n  - Position 3: R (correct)  \n  - Position 5: Y (correct)  \n- **Secret Word Pattern:** `_ U R _ Y`  \n- **Eliminated Letters:** A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V  \n- **Available Letters:** B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z  \n\n### Strategy for Fourth Guess:\n- The goal is to solve for positions 1 and 4 of the pattern `_ U R _ Y`.  \n- Choose a valid English word that fits this pattern, prioritizing common letters to test possibilities:  \n  - Position 1: Test B, F, H, L, M, T (common options).  \n  - Position 4: Test G, L, K, M, T (to cover both positions with minimal duplication).  \n- ""Burly"" was selected:  \n  - B (new) tests position 1.  \n  - L (new) tests position 4.  \n- If incorrect, feedback on B and L will directly reduce possibilities for positions 1 and 4.  \n- Common words fitting the pattern (e.g., ""hurry"", ""murky"", ""turfy"") will be tested based on feedback.\n\n<guess>burly</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: round -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: curvy -> FEEDBACK: C(x) U(✓) R(✓) V(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: burly -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from four guesses:\n\n1. ""arise"": A(not in word), R(in word but wrong position), I(not), S(not), E(not)\n2. ""round"": R(in word but wrong position), O(not), U(in word but wrong position), N(not), D(not)\n3. ""curvy"": C(not), U(correct position), R(correct position), V(not), Y(correct position)\n4. ""burly"": B(not), U(correct), R(correct), L(not), Y(correct)\n\nFrom this, we know definitively:\n- Positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed: Position 2 is U, Position 3 is R, Position 5 is Y.\n- The secret word is of the form: ? U R ? Y\n- Eliminated letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V, B, L (from \'x\' feedback in various guesses)\n\nAdditionally, note that for Guess1: R was in position 2 but marked \'-\', which is consistent with our fixed position (now we know R is at position 3). Similarly, in Guess2 R was in position 1 (wrong) and U was in position 3 (wrong), but now we have U at 2 and R at 3.\n\nNow, the remaining positions are 1 and 4. We need to fill in one letter at position 1 and one at position 4 from the letters not yet eliminated.\n\nAvailable letters (not eliminated): F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z\n\nBut the word must be a valid English word. Pattern: _ U R _ Y\n\nWe need to find a word that fits ? U R ? Y, with both ? being from the available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- FURRY: F U R R Y -> but R is duplicated? And position 4 would be R. Note that we haven\'t excluded R as a possibility for position 4? But wait, in ""curvy"" we only tested R at position 3 (which was correct) but not at position 4. So R could theoretically be at position 4? The secret word might have two R\'s? Yes. Because we only know of one R from the initial feedback, but it could appear twice. However, we haven\'t had feedback that directly contradicts it.\n- HURRY: H U R R Y -> similarly.\n- But let\'s see: in Guess4 we guessed L at position 4 and got \'x\', meaning L is not in the word and specifically not at position 4.\n\nOther possibilities beyond ""furry"" and ""hurry"": \n- MURKY: M U R K Y -> available letters: M and K are not excluded.\n- TURFY: not common, and T is available.\n- JURY is 4 letters.\n- GURDY? Not common.\n- PURDY: but D is eliminated? From Guess2 D(x), yes.\n- BURLY was tried: B U R L Y -> B and L were eliminated.\n- FURLY? Not common.\n\nSo: \n- FURRY: F and R (R duplicated) -> but R is already used? The fourth letter is R.\n- HURRY: H and R.\n- MURKY: M and K.\n\nWhich of these are valid? \n- ""furry"" (adj, covered with fur)\n- ""hurry"" (verb, to rush)\n- ""murky"" (adj, dark and gloomy)\n\nAlso ""curvy"" was tried but doesn\'t fit fourth letter.\n\nWe might have ""purry""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""turvy"" as in ""topsy-turvy"", but not standalone.\n\nSo feasible words: ""furry"", ""hurry"", ""murky"".\n\nNow, to choose one: \n- If we test ""murky"", we test M and K, and if incorrect, we know to look for words with duplicate R?\n- But we have limited guesses (2 left after this).\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests a letter not duplicated? For example, ""murky"" has no duplicate letters.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has duplicate R or not.\n\nSince we haven\'t tested any duplicate R scenarios, both are possible.\n\nBut note: in all previous guesses, we have not guessed a word with R duplicated, so we don\'t have direct feedback on whether there\'s a second R.\n\nHowever, we know from ""curvy"": R was placed in position 3 and we got a check (so should be only one R? Not necessarily, because the feedback shows only if the letter is in the word and position. For example, if the word had two R\'s, and we guess one R in the correct position, we would still get a check? But if we guess R in a wrong position for the duplicate, we might get a \'-\'. But in ""curvy"", we didn\'t try to put R in another position.\n\nSimilarly, in other guesses.\n\nBut no feedback indicated a second R? Not directly. However, we know R is in the word, and no feedback negates the possibility of multiple R\'s.\n\nSo, to resolve, we could guess ""murky"" to test M and K without duplication. Then, if incorrect, we can guess ""furry"" or ""hurry"".\n\nBut if we guess ""murky"" and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we have one more guess.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""furry"", if correct we win; if not, we know the word must be ""hurry"" or another, but the only other option is ""hurry""? Or ""murky""?\n\nWe have two strong candidates: one with duplicate R and one without.\n\nSo we need to pick one.\n\nBut note: the pattern ? U R ? Y: \n- If position 4 is R, then word must be * U R R Y -> like ""furry"", ""hurry"".\n- If position 4 is not R, then it\'s a different letter, like in ""murky"" (K).\n\nAvailable letters for position 1: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z, but the word must be valid.\n\nFor position 4: from available letters, but not R? We can test with R or without.\n\nSince we don\'t know, but we have to choose.\n\nPractical approach: guess ""murky"" because it tests M and K, which are common, and if the feedback shows M or K not present, then we know the word must have R in position 4.\n\nBut let\'s simulate: if we guess ""murky"", and secret is ""furry"":\n- Position1: M vs F -> x (M not in secret)\n- Position2: U -> ✓ (correct)\n- Position3: R -> ✓ (correct)\n- Position4: K vs R -> ? Since in secret R is present, but not at position4? In ""furry"", position4 is R, so if secret is ""furry"", then K is not in the word and R is missing? Wait, no: the secret ""furry"" has positions: F(1), U(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). For guess ""murky"": M(1) -> should be x? Because F is at 1. U(2)✓, R(3)✓, then K(4): secret has R at position4, so K is not R -> x? But R is in the word? Yes, but we already accounted for R at position3? How is the feedback for duplicate letters? In Wordle rules: \nFor a word with duplicate letters, see: \nIf the secret has two R\'s and we guess one R correctly, and another R in the wrong position, we get - for the second R? But in this case, for ""murky"":\n- M: not in secret -> x\n- U: correct\n- R: correct position -> ✓\n- K: not in secret -> x\n- Y: correct -> ✓\nSo feedback: M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)\n\nBut if secret is ""furry"", then K is not in the word? Yes, K is absent. So we get M(x), U(✓), R(✓), K(x), Y(✓). That doesn\'t reveal the fourth position.\n\nBut we would know that position4 is not K, but it doesn\'t tell us what it is.\n\nWe have used the guess showing M and K incorrect.\n\nThen we still don\'t know if it\'s ""furry"" or ""hurry"", etc.\n\nBut we have only one guess left? So we need to test one of them.\n\nBut that was inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, guess ""furry"": \nIf secret is ""furry"", we win.\nIf secret is ""hurry"", we get: F at position1 vs H -> so F would be x? Because H is at 1 in ""hurry"". Then U✓, R✓, R✓ (because R is in secret twice, and we guessed it at position4? In secret ""hurry"": H(1),U(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5). Guess ""furry"": F(1),U(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5). Positions:\n- F vs H: F not in secret? But secret has no F -> x? But is F present? Secret ""hurry"" has no F -> x for F.\n- U✓\n- R✓ (position3)\n- R✓ (position4) because secret has R at position4? Yes? Since we guessed R at position4 and secret has R at position4, it should be check? ✓\n- Y✓\nSo feedback: F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓) -> which shows that R is correct at position4, but we don\'t get the letter for position1.\n\nBut we see F is wrong, and position1 is incorrect.\n\nBut we know then that the secret word has R at position4? Because R4 is ✓? And also R3 is ✓? But we already knew R3.\n\nSo from this, we know position1 must be the one causing issue? And position4 is R.\n\nBut we have to guess again? Only if we don\'t win.\n\nIn this scenario, after ""furry"", we see that F is incorrect? And we have to try HURRY for position1? But then we have one guess.\n\nBut if we guess ""furry"" and secret is ""furry"", we win.\n\nIf secret is ""hurry"", we get feedback F(x) ... and R at 4✓, so we know the pattern is ? U R R Y, and we know position1 must be not F? So we can guess ""hurry"" next? And we win? Given we have tries left.\n\nBut similarly for ""murky"".\n\nBut to solve faster, we should guess a word that distinguishes the possibilities.\n\nSince we are running out of guesses, let’s list the possible words we can form with pattern.\n\nPossible words: \nWith duplicate R: FURRY, HURRY\nWithout duplicate R: MURKY (and perhaps others? Like ... TURGY? Not common. PURRY? No.)\n\nBut ""murky"" is likely the only common one without duplicate R.\n\nAlso, ""gurly"" not common.\n\nTherefore, we have three candidates: ""furry"", ""hurry"", ""murky"".\n\nWith two guesses left, we can choose one arbitrarily.\n\nBut note: from Guess4 ""burly"", we guessed L at position4 and got x, so position4 cannot be L? And not B at position1? But we already knew that.\n\nSimilarly, available letters for position4: from available, but to form word.\n\nPerhaps guess ""murky"" to test if it\'s not duplicated R? Then if ""murky"" is correct, done? If not, then duplicate R must be in the word? So then we guess ""furry"" or ""hurry"".\n\nBut which one?\n\nWe don\'t have information to distinguish ""furry"" and ""hurry"".\n\nSo we have to guess arbitrarily.\n\nTherefore, to maximize commonality? Or reduce options.\n\nSince we have to choose, let\'s pick ""murky"" first? Or directly the duplicate R word.\n\nBut let me check if there are more words: \n- ""jumpy""? No pattern, must be J U R P Y? Not standard. J U M P Y -> no R fixed.\n- The word must have U R R Y pattern? Or U R K Y? Etc.\n\nAnother word: ""turfy"" might be accepted? T U R F Y -> but F in position4? And T in 1? Not common.\n\nSimilarly, ""purty"" not.\n\nSo three options: furry, hurry, murky.\n\nLet us guess ""furry"".\n\nWhy? Because it might win immediately if correct? But then if not, we know to try ""hurry"" or ""murky"" next? And we have one guess left? But if we guess ""furry"" and it\'s ""hurry"", we get feedback that F is wrong? Then we can guess ""hurry"" for the fifth guess? And if ""murky"", we lose.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""murky"" and it\'s not, we know to guess a duplicate R word? Then we can guess ""hurry"" for fifth? But we don\'t know if ""furry"" or ""hurry"".\n\nTherefore, we need a guess that covers the first letter possibilities.\n\nBut we can\'t avoid guessing one of them.\n\nSince no guess gives all information, we should pick one arbitrarily.\n\nLet me pick ""hurry"" because H is a common letter? Or ""murky"" to avoid assumption on duplication.\n\nAnother idea: is there a word that fits the pattern with a letter we haven\'t tried? Such as ""purry""? Not valid.\n\nReally, ""furry"", ""hurry"", ""murky"" seem the main words.\n\nI think ""murky"" is a good choice to test if there is a double R or not.\n\nIf we guess ""murky"":\n\n- If it\'s correct: we win.\n- If not, then the word must have double R? So for the fifth guess, we guess ""furry"" or ""hurry"".\n\nBut which one? We still don\'t know.\n\nAfter guessing ""murky"" and getting e.g. M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓), feedback:\n\n- Position1: unknown, but M is wrong? So if not ""murky"", then position4 must be R? Because we know U, R, Y are in place, so the word must be * U R R Y where * can be F or H or others? P et c, but common are F or H.\n\nBut we have not tested F or H? So we have to guess between furry and hurry? Or check the dictionary.\n\nSo for fifth guess, we can guess ""furry"" or ""hurry"".\n\nBut with no additional info.\n\nTherefore, guessing ""murky"" first doesn\'t resolve position1.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""furry"" and it\'s not, we know to guess ""hurry"" for position1? Or if not ""hurry"", then ""murky"" must be if not? But if ""furry"" is not and secret is ""murky"", then after ""furry"" feedback: F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓) -> wait for position4 we got ✓? But if secret is ""murky"", which has no R at position4? Then feedback on ""furry"" vs secret ""murky"":\n- Position1: F vs M -> F not in secret? x\n- Position2: U✓\n- Position3: R✓\n- Position4: R vs K? Secret position4 has K? So R is not in position4? But secret has only one R? At position3? So when we guess R at position4, secret does not have R at position4? And we have already used the only R? So R at position4: since secret has no second R? Then feedback: R is not in the word? But we have a ✓ at position3? It should be specific per position. For position4: since K is at position4 in secret? We guess R, which is not in secret? But secret has R only at position3? And we already marked R at position3 as ✓? So for position4? R is not in position4 and also not present elsewhere? But we know R is in the word? Therefore, position4 guess R: letter is in the word? No additional? Only if not account duplicates, R is present but not at position4? So it should be \'-\', because R is in the word? Or \'x\' if no additional R?\n\nThis depends on the implementation, but typically, if the secret has one R and we guess two R\'s, one at correct and one at wrong position, the one at correct gets ✓, the one at wrong position gets \'-\' if there is only one occurrence? Or x if the guess has extra.\n\nBut most Wordle: \n- For duplicate letter feedback: it marks greens first, then yellows for the correct letters in wrong positions.\n\nExample: secret SKILL, guess KILLS:\n- First letter K vs SKILL: K is not at position1? So is K in the word? Yes, so mark \'-\' but for our case:\n\nSecret: M U R K Y ? Or F U R R Y?\n\nSuppose secret is ""murky"": only one R at position3.\n\nGuess ""furry"": positions: \n- F: not in secret -> x? Specifically: letter F absent? x\n- U: correct and position? U✓\n- R: correct position? position3 R ✓? Position3: secret has R, guess has R? ✓? Position4: guess has R? Secret has K? So R at position4: is R present elsewhere? No, secret has only one R at position3? Which we already matched? So for position4, R is not in the secret? So it should be x? Because no additional R.\n\nSimilarly in Wordle: secret ""caulk"", guess ""fauna"": first A at position2 is ✓? But second A at position5; secret has no second A? So position5 A: x? Because the duplicate exceeded actual count.\n\nSo similarly: for guess ""furry"" against secret ""murky"":\n- Position1: F not in secret? x\n- Position2: U✓\n- Position3: R✓\n- Position4: R? But secret has only one R? Already counted? So no remaining R? Therefore R not present? So x? And Y✓ \n- So feedback: F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(x) Y(✓) -> note: the second R at position4 is x.\n\nIn feedback format: ✓ for U,R,Y? And x for F and the second R.\n\nSimilarly, if secret is ""furry"": guess ""murky"" gives M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)\n\nSo to differentiate: \n- If we guess ""murky"" and secret is ""furry"", we get M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓? But Y is position5? In ""murky"" Y is position5, in ""furry"" Y position5? So Y should be ✓? So yes: M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)\n- Similarly, secret ""hurry"" guess ""murky"": same.\n\nAnd secret ""murky"" guess ""furry"": as above.\n\nIn addition, guess ""furry"" against ""hurry"": \n- Position1: F vs H? Secret has H? So F is not in secret -> x? But secret has H, which is not F? So F absent? x\n- U✓, R✓, R✓ (because secret has R at position4), Y✓ -> feedback F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)\n\nIn this case, position4 got ✓.\n\nSimilarly, guess ""hurry"" against ""furry"": H(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)\n\nSo only position1 is different.\n\nTherefore, after any guess, we can tell.\n\nGiven this, with two guesses left, we can choose any one.\n\nI think the safest is to guess ""murky"" first? Because if it\'s correct, done? If not, then the secret must be one of the duplicate R words? And we have one guess left? So we can guess ""furry"" or ""hurry""? But which one? We have no info on F and H.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""murky"" and it\'s not correct? Then we have to guess either ""furry"" or ""hurry"".\n\nBut we don\'t know which one? We may lose.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""furry"" and it\'s not correct, then if secret is ""hurry"", we get P1 F x and P4 R ✓, so we know to guess ""hurry"" next? But if secret is ""murky"", we get P1 F x, P4 R x, so we know to .ot ""murky"" next? But we have only one more guess.\n\nAfter guess ""furry"" with secret ""murky"", we get:\n F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(x) Y(✓)\n\n From this, we know:\n- U,R,Y fixed.\n- Position1: not F? And not any excluded letter.\n- Position4: not R (because we guessed R and got x? But why x? Because no extra R? So position4 has a letter that is not R and not F (since F not in word)? Also not in available.\n\nBut we also know position4 is not R? Because feedbackx means it\'s not the letter? So position4 has some other letter? Not R? But in ""murky"", it\'s K.\n\nSo from feedback R(x) at position4, we know position4 is not R? And also K is present in secret? But not? In this feedback, we only got R(x) at position4? But we don\'t know what is at position4 except it\'s not R.\n\nThen for next guess? We need to guess a word with pattern ? U R ? Y, with position4 not R and not L,et c? So we try ""murky""? Which has M and K? But we don\'t know K.\n\nIt\'s messy.\n\nTherefore, with multiple options, we need to guess one of the three.\n\nI think the most common word among the three is ""hurry"" or ""furry"" or ""murky"".\n\nBut from usage, ""hurry"" is common.\n\nOtherwise, ""murky"".\n\nSo let’s guess ""hurry"".\n\nThen if correct, win? If not, but secret is ""furry"", we get feedback? Then fifth guess ""furry"" if not.\n\nSimilarly, if secret is ""murky"", after guess ""hurry"" vs ""murky"": \n- H(1) vs M -> H not in secret? x\n- U✓\n- R✓\n- R: position4 R vs secret K? But secret has only one R? So R at position4: since secret has no extra R? So x? Or we could say?\n\nSecret ""murky"" guess ""hurry"":\n- H position1: not in secret? x\n- U✓\n- R position3: ✓\n- R position4: secret has K? And only one R already counted? So extra R not in secret? x\n- Y✓\n\nSo feedback: H(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(x) Y(✓)\n\nThen we know position4 is not R? And not H? So then we can guess ""murky"" for position1 M and position4 K? And win.\n\nSimilarly, if secret is ""furry"": guess ""hurry"" would give  H position1 vs F? Secret has F at1? H not F? So H absent? x, then U✓, R✓, R✓, Y✓? So feedback H(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓) -> then we know position4 is R? But position1 is wrong? So we guess ""furry"" next.\n\nSo in both cases, with one more guess, we can solve it.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""hurry"" now.\n\nIf not, we have one guess to correct.\n\nSo choice: ""HURRY""Based on the pattern _ U R _ Y and eliminated letters:\n- Must fill positions 1 and 4.\n- Eliminated letters: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V, B, L (from all \'x\' feedback).\n- Available letters for positions 1/4: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z.\n\nPossible common words fitting pattern:\n- ""furry"" (F in 1, R in 4)  \n- ""hurry"" (H in 1, R in 4)  \n- ""murky"" (M in 1, K in 4)  \n\n### Reasoning:  \n- ""Hurry"" is chosen for the 4th guess:  \n  - Tests H at position 1 and R at position 4. \n- If correct, the game ends.  \n- If incorrect, feedback will:  \n  - Confirm if position 4 is R (✓ or -/x) or not.  \n  - Reveal if position 1 is viable.  \n\nWith multiple candidates, ""hurry"" maximizes commonality and leaves one guess to resolve.  \n\n<guess>hurry</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n\n- **Positions 2, 3, and 5** are confirmed as U, R, and Y respectively.  \n- The secret word pattern is: `_ U R _ Y`.  \n- **Eliminated letters (A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V, B, L)** reduce the possible letters for positions 1 and 4 to: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z.  \n- Common valid words fitting the pattern are ""furry"" (F U R R Y), ""hurry"" (H U R R Y), and ""murky"" (M U R K Y).  \n\nFor the fourth guess, ""hurry"" is selected to test:  \n- H at position 1 (possibly correct).  \n- R at position 4 (revealing if duplication exists).  \n\nIf incorrect, feedback on H and the second R (position 4) will narrow down to ""furry"" or ""murky"" for the next guess.\n\n<guess>hurry</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: round -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: curvy -> FEEDBACK: C(x) U(✓) R(✓) V(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: burly -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: hurry -> FEEDBACK: H(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the fifth guess ""hurry"":
- H(x) - H is not in the word
- U(✓) - U is correct and in the right position (position 2)
- R(✓) - R is correct and in the right position (position 3)
- R(✓) - The second R is correct and in the right position (position 4)
- Y(✓) - Y is correct and in the right position (position 5)

But note: the feedback for the second R is a check (✓), meaning that in position 4, the letter R is correct. However, we already knew that position 3 is R, and now position 4 is also R? But the secret word has two R's? And we have R at both positions 3 and 4.

But the feedback for the first R (position 3) is ✓ and the second R (position 4) is also ✓, so the secret word must have R at both positions 3 and 4.

But wait, the pattern is _ U R _ Y, and with the second R at position 4, that means the word is _ U R R Y.

Now, the first position is missing, and we know H is not in the word (from H(x) in this guess).

Also, from previous feedback, we have eliminated many letters.

Now, the secret word is of the form: ? U R R Y

We know the first letter cannot be H (from this guess), and also cannot be any of the previously eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters: from all guesses:
- Guess1: A, I, S, E
- Guess2: O, N, D
- Guess3: C, V
- Guess4: B, L
- Guess5: H

So eliminated: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, V, B, L, H

Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z

But Y is already at position 5, so for position 1, we can use any of the available except Y? But Y is in the word, but we are not putting it at position 1.

The word must be a valid English word: ? U R R Y

Possible words:
- FURRY: F U R R Y
- PURRY? Not common, but ""purry"" might not be standard.
- MURRY? Not common.
- CURRY: but C is eliminated? Yes, from guess3 C(x).
- BURRY? B is eliminated.
- HURRY: we just tried, and H is eliminated? But we got H(x) so not H.

So the only common word left is ""furry"".

Therefore, the secret word must be ""furry"".

We have one guess left, so we can guess ""furry"".

But let's confirm: is there any other word? Like ""gurry""? Not common. ""jurry""? Not a word. ""turry""? Not common. So ""furry"" is the only common word.

Thus, we guess ""furry"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Pattern Confirmed**: The secret word is `_ U R R Y` (positions 2–5 are fixed: U at 2, R at 3, R at 4, Y at 5).
- **Position 1**: Must be filled with a letter not eliminated.
- **Eliminated Letters** (from all feedback):  
  A, I, S, E (Guess 1), O, N, D (Guess 2), C, V (Guess 3), B, L (Guess 4), H (Guess 5).  
  **Total eliminated**: A, B, C, D, E, H, I, L, N, O, S, V.
- **Available Letters for Position 1**: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Z.

### Deduction:
- The only common English word fitting `_ U R R Y` is **FURRY** (F at position 1).  
- Other combinations (e.g., GURRY, JURRY, MURRY) are uncommon or invalid.  
- Since ""hurry"" (H at position 1) was incorrect in Guess 5, **F is the only viable common letter** for position 1.

### Final Guess: FURRY
- Tests F at position 1 (the only unknown).
- Matches the pattern `_ U R R Y` with all confirmed positions.

But the feedback for the first R (position 3) is ✓ and the second R (position 4) is also ✓, so the secret word must have R at both positions 3 and 4.

But wait, the pattern is _ U R _ Y, and with the second R at position 4, that means the word is _ U R R Y.

Now, the first position is missing, and we know H is not in the word (from H(x) in this guess).

Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z

But Y is already at position 5, so for position 1, we can use any of the available except Y? But Y is in the word, but we are not putting it at position 1.

The word must be a valid English word: ? U R R Y

Possible words:
- FURRY: F U R R Y

- MURRY? Not common.
- CURRY: but C is eliminated? Yes, from guess3 C(x).
- BURRY? B is eliminated.
- HURRY: we just tried, and H is eliminated? But we got H(x) so not H.

So the only common word left is ""furry"".

Therefore, the secret word must be ""furry"".

We have one guess left, so we can guess ""furry"".
