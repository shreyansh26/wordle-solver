We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 
 - C and R are common consonants.
 - A and E are common vowels.
 - N is also a common consonant.

 This word covers 5 distinct letters and is a valid English word.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, from this we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word:
     R is not at position 2.
     E is not at position 5.

 - The letters C, A, and N are not in the word at all.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
   a) Includes R and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
   b) Avoids using C, A, and N (since they are not in the word).
   c) Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of possible words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 We know R must be in a position other than 2. So R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E must be in a position other than 5. So E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also want to include new common letters to test. Some common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 Since R is in the word but not at position 2, and E is in the word but not at position 5, we can try to place R and E in new positions.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and E, and three new letters.

 Example: We could try a word with R at position 1 and E at position 4? Or R at position 3 and E at position 2? etc.

 We also note that we have 6 tries, so we can afford to be a bit aggressive in testing multiple letters.

 One common strategy is to use a word that uses as many new letters as possible, while including the known letters (R and E) in positions that are allowed.

 Let me think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Possibilities:
 - ""ROUSE"": R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed (from feedback: E cannot be at position 5). So avoid E at 5.
 - ""RESET"": R at 1, E at 2, S, E at 4, T -> but we have two E's? Also, we don't know if the word has two E's. But it's possible. However, we have E at position 2 and 4. We know E is in the word but not at position 5, but it could be at 2 or 4? But wait, in ""crane"", E was at position 5 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at 5. So if we put E at 2 or 4, that's allowed. However, we don't know if the word has two E's.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only told us that E is in the word (at least one E) and not at position 5. It doesn't tell us if there is more than one E.

 However, to maximize information, we might prefer a word with all new letters and without repeating letters if possible.

 Let me try to think of words that have R and E, and three new consonants or vowels.

 Another idea: ""TRIBE"" -> T, R, I, B, E. 
   Positions: R at 2? But in ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got a '-' meaning that R is in the word but not at position 2. So in ""TRIBE"", if we put R at position 2 again, that would be the same position. We should avoid putting R at position 2.

 So in ""TRIBE"", R is at position 2 -> that's the same as before. We know R is not at position 2, so we should avoid that.

 How about ""BRIER""? But that has two R's and two E's? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have R at position 2 again -> avoid.

 We need to put R in a position that is not 2. Let me try:

 Option: ""RODEO"" -> but no E? We must include E.

 Option: ""STREP"": 
   S, T, R, E, P.
   R is at position 3 -> not 2, good.
   E is at position 4 -> not 5, good.

 But note: we have S, T, R, E, P. We haven't tested S, T, or P.

 However, we also have to avoid A, C, N. This word avoids them.

 So ""STREP"" is a valid guess.

 But let me check if it's a valid English word: yes, it's a word (a type of bacteria or a medical term).

 Alternatively, we could try ""PRESO"" (if we allow less common words) but ""PRESO"" might not be common. 

 Another common word: ""TIRED"" -> T, I, R, E, D.
   R is at position 3 -> not 2, good.
   E is at position 4 -> not 5, good.

 This uses T, I, R, E, D. We haven't tested I and D.

 But note: we have two vowels? Actually, T, I, R, E, D: I and E are vowels.

 How about ""DRIVE""? D, R, I, V, E -> R at position 2? Again, position 2 for R is not allowed.

 We must avoid R at position 2.

 So ""TIRED"" has R at position 3: that's good.

 Another option: ""ROGUE"" -> R at 1, O, G, U, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed. So avoid.

 How about ""RIPER""? -> R at 1 and 5, I, P, E at 4. But E at 4 is allowed. However, we have two R's? And we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we are repeating R at position 1? But we don't know if R is at position 1. It's allowed to try.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 After considering, I think ""STREP"" and ""TIRED"" are good candidates.

 Let me also consider ""PUREE"": P, U, R, E, E -> but E at position 5? Not allowed. And two E's.

 How about ""GRUEL"": G, R, U, E, L -> R at position 2? Not allowed.

 How about ""PERKY"": P, E, R, K, Y -> 
   E at position 2 -> allowed (since we only know E is not at 5, but 2 is new)
   R at position 3 -> allowed (not 2)

 This uses P, E, R, K, Y. All new letters.

 But note: we have E at position 2 and R at position 3. This is valid.

 However, we don't know if the word has a P, K, or Y.

 Another candidate: ""WROTE"": W, R, O, T, E -> 
   R at position 2? Not allowed.

 How about ""WREST"": W, R, E, S, T -> 
   R at position 2? Not allowed.

 We see that avoiding R at position 2 is tricky.

 Let me list words that have R and E, with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

 Some ideas:
 - R at 1: e.g., ""REBUS"", ""REMIT"", ""REVEL"", ""ROBES"" (but E at 5 in ""ROBES"" is not allowed)
   For ""REMIT"": R(1), E(2), M(3), I(4), T(5) -> E at 2 is allowed, but E at 2? We don't have a restriction on E at 2. However, we have T at 5? That's allowed because we only know E is not at 5, but T can be at 5.

   But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. ""REMIT"" avoids them.

   However, we have E at position 2: that's a new position. We don't know if E is at 2 or not.

 - R at 3: e.g., ""TIRED"", ""FIRED"", ""HIRED"", ""WIRED"", ""BARED"" (but A is not allowed) -> so ""TIRED"", ""FIRED"", ""HIRED"", ""WIRED"" are okay? But we must avoid A, C, N. ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> no A, C, N.

 - R at 4: e.g., ""OPTER"" (not common), ""UTTER"" (but T repeated and E at 5? not allowed) -> hard.

 - R at 5: e.g., ""LATER"" (but A is not allowed), ""RACER"" (A and C not allowed) -> not good.

 So let's choose between ""REMIT"" and ""TIRED"".

 Why not ""STREP""? It has R at 3 and E at 4, and uses S, T, P which are common.

 I think ""STREP"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places R and E in new positions.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but ""STREP"" has no duplicates.

 Alternatively, ""TIRED"" is also good.

 Let me compare:

 ""STREP"": 
   S (new), T (new), R (known, at position 3), E (known, at position 4), P (new)

 ""TIRED"":
   T (new), I (new), R (known, at position 3), E (known, at position 4), D (new)

 Both are good. I'll go with ""STREP"" because it has more common consonants.

 But note: we have already used S in the first guess? In the first guess we had ""crane"" which had S? No, ""crane"" had C, R, A, N, E. So S is new.

 Actually, we haven't used S, T, P, I, D, etc.

 Since both are valid, I'll choose ""STREP"".

 However, let me check if ""STREP"" is a valid word: yes.

 So second guess: ""STREP""

 We'll get feedback on this and then adjust.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""STREP"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2.  
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5.  
- **C, A, N** are not in the word.  

For the next guess, I need a word that:  
1. Includes **R** and **E** (confirmed letters), but avoids placing **R** at position 2 or **E** at position 5.  
2. Excludes **C, A, N**.  
3. Tests new common letters (e.g., **S, T, P**) to gather more information.  

I chose **""STREP""** because:  
- **R** is at position 3 (not 2).  
- **E** is at position 4 (not 5).  
- It introduces new letters: **S, T, P**.  
- It avoids **C, A, N** and reuses known letters efficiently.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,RIVER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 
 - C and R are common consonants.
 - A and E are common vowels.
 - N is also a common consonant.

 This word covers 5 distinct letters and is a valid English word.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, from this we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word:
     R is not at position 2.
     E is not at position 5.

 - The letters C, A, and N are not in the word at all.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
   a) Includes R and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
   b) Avoids using C, A, and N (since they are not in the word).
   c) Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of possible words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 We know R must be in a position other than 2. So R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E must be in a position other than 5. So E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also want to include new common letters to test. Some common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 Since R is in the word but not at position 2, and E is in the word but not at position 5, we can try to place R and E in new positions.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and E, and three new letters.

 Example: We could try a word with R at position 1 and E at position 4? Or R at position 3 and E at position 2? etc.

 We also note that we have 6 tries, so we can afford to be a bit aggressive in testing multiple letters.

 One common strategy is to use a word that uses as many new letters as possible, while including the known letters (R and E) in positions that are allowed.

 Let me think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Possibilities:
 - ""ROUSE"": R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed (from feedback: E cannot be at position 5). So avoid E at 5.
 - ""RESET"": R at 1, E at 2, S, E at 4, T -> but we have two E's? Also, we don't know if the word has two E's. But it's possible. However, we have E at position 2 and 4. We know E is in the word but not at position 5, but it could be at 2 or 4? But wait, in ""crane"", E was at position 5 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at 5. So if we put E at 2 or 4, that's allowed. However, we don't know if the word has two E's.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only told us that E is in the word (at least one E) and not at position 5. It doesn't tell us if there is more than one E.

 However, to maximize information, we might prefer a word with all new letters and without repeating letters if possible.

 Let me try to think of words that have R and E, and three new consonants or vowels.

 Another idea: ""TRIBE"" -> T, R, I, B, E. 
   Positions: R at 2? But in ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got a '-' meaning that R is in the word but not at position 2. So in ""TRIBE"", if we put R at position 2 again, that would be the same position. We should avoid putting R at position 2.

 So in ""TRIBE"", R is at position 2 -> that's the same as before. We know R is not at position 2, so we should avoid that.

 How about ""BRIER""? But that has two R's and two E's? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have R at position 2 again -> avoid.

 We need to put R in a position that is not 2. Let me try:

 Option: ""RODEO"" -> but no E? We must include E.

 Option: ""STREP"": 
   S, T, R, E, P.
   R is at position 3 -> not 2, good.
   E is at position 4 -> not 5, good.

 But note: we have S, T, R, E, P. We haven't tested S, T, or P.

 However, we also have to avoid A, C, N. This word avoids them.

 So ""STREP"" is a valid guess.

 But let me check if it's a valid English word: yes, it's a word (a type of bacteria or a medical term).

 Alternatively, we could try ""PRESO"" (if we allow less common words) but ""PRESO"" might not be common. 

 Another common word: ""TIRED"" -> T, I, R, E, D.
   R is at position 3 -> not 2, good.
   E is at position 4 -> not 5, good.

 This uses T, I, R, E, D. We haven't tested I and D.

 But note: we have two vowels? Actually, T, I, R, E, D: I and E are vowels.

 How about ""DRIVE""? D, R, I, V, E -> R at position 2? Again, position 2 for R is not allowed.

 We must avoid R at position 2.

 So ""TIRED"" has R at position 3: that's good.

 Another option: ""ROGUE"" -> R at 1, O, G, U, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed. So avoid.

 How about ""RIPER""? -> R at 1 and 5, I, P, E at 4. But E at 4 is allowed. However, we have two R's? And we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we are repeating R at position 1? But we don't know if R is at position 1. It's allowed to try.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 After considering, I think ""STREP"" and ""TIRED"" are good candidates.

 Let me also consider ""PUREE"": P, U, R, E, E -> but E at position 5? Not allowed. And two E's.

 How about ""GRUEL"": G, R, U, E, L -> R at position 2? Not allowed.

 How about ""PERKY"": P, E, R, K, Y -> 
   E at position 2 -> allowed (since we only know E is not at 5, but 2 is new)
   R at position 3 -> allowed (not 2)

 This uses P, E, R, K, Y. All new letters.

 But note: we have E at position 2 and R at position 3. This is valid.

 However, we don't know if the word has a P, K, or Y.

 Another candidate: ""WROTE"": W, R, O, T, E -> 
   R at position 2? Not allowed.

 How about ""WREST"": W, R, E, S, T -> 
   R at position 2? Not allowed.

 We see that avoiding R at position 2 is tricky.

 Let me list words that have R and E, with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

 Some ideas:
 - R at 1: e.g., ""REBUS"", ""REMIT"", ""REVEL"", ""ROBES"" (but E at 5 in ""ROBES"" is not allowed)
   For ""REMIT"": R(1), E(2), M(3), I(4), T(5) -> E at 2 is allowed, but E at 2? We don't have a restriction on E at 2. However, we have T at 5? That's allowed because we only know E is not at 5, but T can be at 5.

   But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. ""REMIT"" avoids them.

   However, we have E at position 2: that's a new position. We don't know if E is at 2 or not.

 - R at 3: e.g., ""TIRED"", ""FIRED"", ""HIRED"", ""WIRED"", ""BARED"" (but A is not allowed) -> so ""TIRED"", ""FIRED"", ""HIRED"", ""WIRED"" are okay? But we must avoid A, C, N. ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> no A, C, N.

 - R at 4: e.g., ""OPTER"" (not common), ""UTTER"" (but T repeated and E at 5? not allowed) -> hard.

 - R at 5: e.g., ""LATER"" (but A is not allowed), ""RACER"" (A and C not allowed) -> not good.

 So let's choose between ""REMIT"" and ""TIRED"".

 Why not ""STREP""? It has R at 3 and E at 4, and uses S, T, P which are common.

 I think ""STREP"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places R and E in new positions.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but ""STREP"" has no duplicates.

 Alternatively, ""TIRED"" is also good.

 Let me compare:

 ""STREP"": 
   S (new), T (new), R (known, at position 3), E (known, at position 4), P (new)

 ""TIRED"":
   T (new), I (new), R (known, at position 3), E (known, at position 4), D (new)

 Both are good. I'll go with ""STREP"" because it has more common consonants.

 But note: we have already used S in the first guess? In the first guess we had ""crane"" which had S? No, ""crane"" had C, R, A, N, E. So S is new.

 Actually, we haven't used S, T, P, I, D, etc.

 Since both are valid, I'll choose ""STREP"".

 However, let me check if ""STREP"" is a valid word: yes.

 So second guess: ""STREP""

 We'll get feedback on this and then adjust.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""STREP"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2.  
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5.  
- **C, A, N** are not in the word.  

For the next guess, I need a word that:  
1. Includes **R** and **E** (confirmed letters), but avoids placing **R** at position 2 or **E** at position 5.  
2. Excludes **C, A, N**.  
3. Tests new common letters (e.g., **S, T, P**) to gather more information.  

I chose **""STREP""** because:  
- **R** is at position 3 (not 2).  
- **E** is at position 4 (not 5).  
- It introduces new letters: **S, T, P**.  
- It avoids **C, A, N** and reuses known letters efficiently.

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""strep""

  R: - (in the word, but not at position 3)  [since it was at position 3 in this guess and got a dash]
  E: ✓ (in the word and at the correct position, which is position 4)
  P: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The letter E is in the word and is at position 4. (Because in ""strep"", E was at position 4 and we got a checkmark.)

2. The letter R is in the word, but it is not at position 2 (from the first guess) and not at position 3 (from the second guess). So R must be at position 1 or 5? But wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

   However, note that position 4 is taken by E. So R cannot be at position 4. Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 5.

3. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, S, T, P.

4. We have two known letters: E (at position 4) and R (somewhere, but not at 2 or 3, and not at 4 because that's E, so only positions 1 or 5).

Now, we need to make a third guess. The goal is to find the entire word.

We know:
  Position 4: E

And R must be at position 1 or 5.

We also need to find the letters for positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 (but note: if R is at 1, then position 5 is open, and vice versa).

We should choose a word that:
  - Has E at position 4 (fixed).
  - Includes R at either position 1 or 5 (we don't know which, so we can try one of them and see).
  - Uses only letters that we haven't eliminated. Eliminated letters: C, A, N, S, T, P.

What letters are available? We have the entire alphabet minus the eliminated ones. But we should focus on common letters.

Eliminated: C, A, N, S, T, P.

So available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: We have E (already placed), and the other vowels are I, O, U. Note: A is eliminated.

We also know that the word must contain R (either at 1 or 5) and E (at 4).

We can consider two cases for R: at position 1 or at position 5.

But we don't know which, so we might design a guess that can help us determine that.

Alternatively, we can try to cover both possibilities by including R in one of the positions and testing other letters for the rest.

However, we have only 4 guesses left, so we need to be efficient.

Let me think of words that have E at position 4 and R at either 1 or 5.

Case 1: R at position 1
  Then the word is: R _ _ E _
  We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5.

Case 2: R at position 5
  Then the word is: _ _ _ E R

We can try to guess a word that has R at position 1 and then another word that has R at position 5? But we can only guess one word now.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't have R at 1 or 5, but that wouldn't help because we know R is in the word and must be at 1 or 5. So we must put R at either 1 or 5 in our guess to test.

But note: if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it's not, then we know R must be at 5. Similarly, if we put R at 5 and it's correct, we get a check; if not, then R must be at 1.

So we can choose one of the two positions for R and then use the feedback to know.

But we also want to test other letters.

Let me try to form words for each case:

Case 1: R at 1: R _ _ E _
  We need letters for positions 2, 3, 5. We cannot use eliminated letters.

  Some words: 
    RILEY -> R I L E Y -> but Y is at position 5? And we have E at 4. But note: we don't know if Y is in the word. Also, we have to avoid eliminated letters: I, L, Y are not eliminated? 
    But let's check: eliminated are C,A,N,S,T,P. So I, L, Y are available.

    However, ""RILEY"" is a valid word? Yes, but note: we have E at position 4, so the word must be R I L E Y? That's positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:L, 4:E, 5:Y.

    But we don't know if the word has I, L, or Y.

  Another: RIFLE -> R I F L E -> but E is at position 5? We need E at 4. So this doesn't work.

  We need E at 4, so the word must be: R ? ? E ?

  Examples: 
    RIDGE: R I D G E -> but E at 5? Not at 4.
    RINSE: but N and S are eliminated.
    RUMBLE: too long.

  Actually, 5-letter words with E at 4 and R at 1:

    RABBE: but A is eliminated.
    RANGE: A and N eliminated.
    RAREE: A eliminated.

  It's tricky. Let me think:

    RILEY: as above -> R I L E Y -> positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:L, 4:E, 5:Y -> valid.

    Other options: 
      RICED: but C and D? C is eliminated.
      RIFLE: E at 5, not 4.
      RIVET: V and T? T is eliminated.

    How about ""RIPED""? But P is eliminated.

    Another: ""RIPEN"": P and N eliminated.

    ""RIDER"": D and R? But R at 1 and 5? And E at 4? R I D E R -> that would be positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:D, 4:E, 5:R. But we have two R's? We don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we have to avoid eliminated letters: D is available? Yes, because we haven't eliminated D.

    But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and got a dash, meaning at least one R is in the word. But it could be that there are two R's? The feedback doesn't tell us the count. So it's possible.

    However, in ""RIDER"", we have R at position 1 and 5. We don't know if that's allowed. But we can try.

    But we are trying to form a guess for case 1.

    Alternatively, ""RILED"": R I L E D -> positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:L, 4:E, 5:D. This is a valid word.

    So ""RILED"" is a candidate for case 1.

Case 2: R at 5: _ _ _ E R
  We need letters for positions 1,2,3.

  Examples:
    OILER: O I L E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:I, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R -> valid.
    Other: 
      BOXER: O and X? But O and X are available? Eliminated: C,A,N,S,T,P. So B, O, X are available.
      BUT: we have to avoid eliminated letters. ""BOXER"": B O X E R -> valid.
      ""DOPER"": but P is eliminated.
      ""HOMER"": H O M E R -> valid.

  So for case 2, we have words like ""OILER"", ""BOXER"", ""HOMER"".

But we don't know which case we are in. So we need to choose a guess that will help us distinguish.

We can choose a word that has R at position 1 (to test case 1) and then if it's not, we know it's case 2. Or vice versa.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 1 and also includes other common letters for the remaining positions, and if we get a check for R at 1, then we know. If not, then R must be at 5.

Similarly, we could put R at 5 and see.

Let me decide to test R at position 1. Why? Because if we put R at 1 and it's correct, then we get a check and we know. If not, then R must be at 5.

So for the third guess, I will try a word with R at position 1 and E at position 4.

We have a candidate: ""RILED"" -> R I L E D.

But note: we are also testing I, L, D.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has more common letters? But we don't have many common letters left that are not eliminated.

Common letters left: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, U, etc.

""RILED"" uses I, L, D.

Another candidate: ""RIVED"" -> but V is less common? And we have to avoid eliminated letters. V is available.

But ""RIVED"" is a word? Yes, past tense of rive.

But I think ""RILED"" is more common.

Another: ""RIDER"" -> but that has two R's? We don't know if the word has two R's. But if we use ""RIDER"", then we have R at 1 and 5. If the word has only one R, then if R is at 5, then in ""RIDER"" the R at 1 would be a dash (if the word has R only at 5) and the R at 5 would be a check? But we don't know the count.

To avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid duplicate letters for now.

So ""RILED"" is a good choice: R I L E D.

But note: we are testing R at position 1. If we get a check for R, then we know R is at 1. If we get a dash, then R is not at 1, so it must be at 5. And if we get an x, that would mean R is not in the word? But we know R is in the word (from the first guess). So we should get either a check or a dash.

But if we put R at 1 and the word has R at 5, then we would get a dash for R at 1 (because R is in the word but not at 1) and then we would know R is at 5.

So the feedback for R in this guess will tell us:

  - If ✓: then R is at position 1.
  - If -: then R is at position 5 (because that's the only other possibility).

So we can get the position of R from this guess.

Additionally, we will get feedback on I, L, and D.

Therefore, I choose ""RILED"" as the third guess.

But wait: what about the E? In ""RILED"", E is at position 4, which we know is correct. So we should get a check for E again? But we already know E is at 4, so that doesn't give new information. But it's okay.

So let's go with ""RILED"".

But note: we have to avoid eliminated letters. ""RILED"" has R, I, L, E, D. None of these are eliminated (eliminated: C,A,N,S,T,P). So it's safe.

Therefore, the third guess is ""RILED"".

But let me confirm the word: R-I-L-E-D.

Now, we will get feedback on each letter.

We are hoping to get the position of R and also learn about I, L, D.

If we are lucky, we might even get the whole word.

So, the guess is ""RILED"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:  
- **E** is confirmed at position 4 (from Guess 2: ""strep"" → E(✓)).  
- **R** is in the word but not at positions 2 or 3 (from Guess 1 and 2). Since position 4 is occupied by E, **R must be at position 1 or 5**.  
- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, S, T, P** (marked ""x"" in feedback).  

For the next guess, I need to:  
1. **Test R's position**: Place R at position 1 to check if it belongs there. If feedback shows R(✓), it confirms position 1; if R(-), it confirms R is at position 5.  
2. **Keep E at position 4** (known correct position).  
3. **Use new, common letters** not yet tested or eliminated (e.g., I, L, D).  
4. **Avoid eliminated letters**.  

I chose **""RILED""** because:  
- **R** is at position 1 (testing the hypothesis).  
- **E** is at position 4 (fixed).  
- **I, L, D** are new, common letters.  
- The word is valid and avoids all eliminated letters.  

This guess will efficiently narrow down R's position and provide new information about I, L, and D.  

<guess>riled</guess>",riled,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""strep""
  S: x (not in the word)
  T: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word, but not at position 3)  [since it was at position 3 in this guess and got a dash]
  E: ✓ (in the word and at the correct position, which is position 4)
  P: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The letter E is in the word and is at position 4. (Because in ""strep"", E was at position 4 and we got a checkmark.)

2. The letter R is in the word, but it is not at position 2 (from the first guess) and not at position 3 (from the second guess). So R must be at position 1 or 5? But wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

   However, note that position 4 is taken by E. So R cannot be at position 4. Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 5.

3. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, S, T, P.

4. We have two known letters: E (at position 4) and R (somewhere, but not at 2 or 3, and not at 4 because that's E, so only positions 1 or 5).

Now, we need to make a third guess. The goal is to find the entire word.

We know:
  Position 4: E

And R must be at position 1 or 5.

We also need to find the letters for positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 (but note: if R is at 1, then position 5 is open, and vice versa).

We should choose a word that:
  - Has E at position 4 (fixed).
  - Includes R at either position 1 or 5 (we don't know which, so we can try one of them and see).
  - Uses only letters that we haven't eliminated. Eliminated letters: C, A, N, S, T, P.

What letters are available? We have the entire alphabet minus the eliminated ones. But we should focus on common letters.

Eliminated: C, A, N, S, T, P.

So available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: We have E (already placed), and the other vowels are I, O, U. Note: A is eliminated.

We also know that the word must contain R (either at 1 or 5) and E (at 4).

We can consider two cases for R: at position 1 or at position 5.

But we don't know which, so we might design a guess that can help us determine that.

Alternatively, we can try to cover both possibilities by including R in one of the positions and testing other letters for the rest.

However, we have only 4 guesses left, so we need to be efficient.

Let me think of words that have E at position 4 and R at either 1 or 5.

Case 1: R at position 1
  Then the word is: R _ _ E _
  We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5.

Case 2: R at position 5
  Then the word is: _ _ _ E R

We can try to guess a word that has R at position 1 and then another word that has R at position 5? But we can only guess one word now.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't have R at 1 or 5, but that wouldn't help because we know R is in the word and must be at 1 or 5. So we must put R at either 1 or 5 in our guess to test.

But note: if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it's not, then we know R must be at 5. Similarly, if we put R at 5 and it's correct, we get a check; if not, then R must be at 1.

So we can choose one of the two positions for R and then use the feedback to know.

But we also want to test other letters.

    So ""RILED"" is a candidate for case 1.

Case 2: R at 5: _ _ _ E R
  We need letters for positions 1,2,3.

  Examples:
    OILER: O I L E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:I, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R -> valid.
    Other:

      BUT: we have to avoid eliminated letters. ""BOXER"": B O X E R -> valid.
      ""DOPER"": but P is eliminated.
      ""HOMER"": H O M E R -> valid.

  So for case 2, we have words like ""OILER"", ""BOXER"", ""HOMER"".

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 
 - C and R are common consonants.
 - A and E are common vowels.
 - N is also a common consonant.

 This word covers 5 distinct letters and is a valid English word.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, from this we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word:
     R is not at position 2.
     E is not at position 5.

 - The letters C, A, and N are not in the word at all.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
   a) Includes R and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
   b) Avoids using C, A, and N (since they are not in the word).
   c) Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of possible words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 We know R must be in a position other than 2. So R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E must be in a position other than 5. So E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also want to include new common letters to test. Some common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 Since R is in the word but not at position 2, and E is in the word but not at position 5, we can try to place R and E in new positions.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and E, and three new letters.

 Example: We could try a word with R at position 1 and E at position 4? Or R at position 3 and E at position 2? etc.

 We also note that we have 6 tries, so we can afford to be a bit aggressive in testing multiple letters.

 One common strategy is to use a word that uses as many new letters as possible, while including the known letters (R and E) in positions that are allowed.

 Let me think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Possibilities:
 - ""ROUSE"": R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5 -> but E at position 5 is not allowed (from feedback: E cannot be at position 5). So avoid E at 5.
 - ""RESET"": R at 1, E at 2, S, E at 4, T -> but we have two E's? Also, we don't know if the word has two E's. But it's possible. However, we have E at position 2 and 4. We know E is in the word but not at position 5, but it could be at 2 or 4? But wait, in ""crane"", E was at position 5 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at 5. So if we put E at 2 or 4, that's allowed. However, we don't know if the word has two E's.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only told us that E is in the word (at least one E) and not at position 5. It doesn't tell us if there is more than one E.

 However, to maximize information, we might prefer a word with all new letters and without repeating letters if possible.

 Let me try to think of words that have R and E, and three new consonants or vowels.

 Another idea: ""TRIBE"" -> T, R, I, B, E. 
   Positions: R at 2? But in ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got a '-' meaning that R is in the word but not at position 2. So in ""TRIBE"", if we put R at position 2 again, that would be the same position. We should avoid putting R at position 2.

 So in ""TRIBE"", R is at position 2 -> that's the same as before. We know R is not at position 2, so we should avoid that.

 How about ""BRIER""? But that has two R's and two E's? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have R at position 2 again -> avoid.

 We need to put R in a position that is not 2. Let me try:

 Option: ""RODEO"" -> but no E? We must include E.

 Option: ""STREP"": 
   S, T, R, E, P.
   R is at position 3 -> not 2, good.
   E is at position 4 -> not 5, good.

 But note: we have S, T, R, E, P. We haven't tested S, T, or P.

 However, we also have to avoid A, C, N. This word avoids them.

 So ""STREP"" is a valid guess.

 But let me check if it's a valid English word: yes, it's a word (a type of bacteria or a medical term).

 Alternatively, we could try ""PRESO"" (if we allow less common words) but ""PRESO"" might not be common. 

 Another common word: ""TIRED"" -> T, I, R, E, D.
   R is at position 3 -> not 2, good.
   E is at position 4 -> not 5, good.

 This uses T, I, R, E, D. We haven't tested I and D.

 But note: we have two vowels? Actually, T, I, R, E, D: I and E are vowels.

 How about ""DRIVE""? D, R, I, V, E -> R at position 2? Again, position 2 for R is not allowed.

 We must avoid R at position 2.

 So ""TIRED"" has R at position 3: that's good.

 Another option: ""ROGUE"" -> R at 1, O, G, U, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed. So avoid.

 How about ""RIPER""? -> R at 1 and 5, I, P, E at 4. But E at 4 is allowed. However, we have two R's? And we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we are repeating R at position 1? But we don't know if R is at position 1. It's allowed to try.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 After considering, I think ""STREP"" and ""TIRED"" are good candidates.

 Let me also consider ""PUREE"": P, U, R, E, E -> but E at position 5? Not allowed. And two E's.

 How about ""GRUEL"": G, R, U, E, L -> R at position 2? Not allowed.

 How about ""PERKY"": P, E, R, K, Y -> 
   E at position 2 -> allowed (since we only know E is not at 5, but 2 is new)
   R at position 3 -> allowed (not 2)

 This uses P, E, R, K, Y. All new letters.

 But note: we have E at position 2 and R at position 3. This is valid.

 However, we don't know if the word has a P, K, or Y.

 Another candidate: ""WROTE"": W, R, O, T, E -> 
   R at position 2? Not allowed.

 How about ""WREST"": W, R, E, S, T -> 
   R at position 2? Not allowed.

 We see that avoiding R at position 2 is tricky.

 Let me list words that have R and E, with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

 Some ideas:
 - R at 1: e.g., ""REBUS"", ""REMIT"", ""REVEL"", ""ROBES"" (but E at 5 in ""ROBES"" is not allowed)
   For ""REMIT"": R(1), E(2), M(3), I(4), T(5) -> E at 2 is allowed, but E at 2? We don't have a restriction on E at 2. However, we have T at 5? That's allowed because we only know E is not at 5, but T can be at 5.

   But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. ""REMIT"" avoids them.

   However, we have E at position 2: that's a new position. We don't know if E is at 2 or not.

 - R at 3: e.g., ""TIRED"", ""FIRED"", ""HIRED"", ""WIRED"", ""BARED"" (but A is not allowed) -> so ""TIRED"", ""FIRED"", ""HIRED"", ""WIRED"" are okay? But we must avoid A, C, N. ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> no A, C, N.

 - R at 4: e.g., ""OPTER"" (not common), ""UTTER"" (but T repeated and E at 5? not allowed) -> hard.

 - R at 5: e.g., ""LATER"" (but A is not allowed), ""RACER"" (A and C not allowed) -> not good.

 So let's choose between ""REMIT"" and ""TIRED"".

 Why not ""STREP""? It has R at 3 and E at 4, and uses S, T, P which are common.

 I think ""STREP"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places R and E in new positions.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but ""STREP"" has no duplicates.

 Alternatively, ""TIRED"" is also good.

 Let me compare:

 ""STREP"": 
   S (new), T (new), R (known, at position 3), E (known, at position 4), P (new)

 ""TIRED"":
   T (new), I (new), R (known, at position 3), E (known, at position 4), D (new)

 Both are good. I'll go with ""STREP"" because it has more common consonants.

 But note: we have already used S in the first guess? In the first guess we had ""crane"" which had S? No, ""crane"" had C, R, A, N, E. So S is new.

 Actually, we haven't used S, T, P, I, D, etc.

 Since both are valid, I'll choose ""STREP"".

 However, let me check if ""STREP"" is a valid word: yes.

 So second guess: ""STREP""

 We'll get feedback on this and then adjust.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""STREP"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2.  
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5.  
- **C, A, N** are not in the word.  

For the next guess, I need a word that:  
1. Includes **R** and **E** (confirmed letters), but avoids placing **R** at position 2 or **E** at position 5.  
2. Excludes **C, A, N**.  
3. Tests new common letters (e.g., **S, T, P**) to gather more information.  

I chose **""STREP""** because:  
- **R** is at position 3 (not 2).  
- **E** is at position 4 (not 5).  
- It introduces new letters: **S, T, P**.  
- It avoids **C, A, N** and reuses known letters efficiently.

<guess>strep</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: strep -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""strep""
  S: x (not in the word)
  T: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word, but not at position 3)  [since it was at position 3 in this guess and got a dash]
  E: ✓ (in the word and at the correct position, which is position 4)
  P: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The letter E is in the word and is at position 4. (Because in ""strep"", E was at position 4 and we got a checkmark.)

2. The letter R is in the word, but it is not at position 2 (from the first guess) and not at position 3 (from the second guess). So R must be at position 1 or 5? But wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

   However, note that position 4 is taken by E. So R cannot be at position 4. Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 5.

3. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, S, T, P.

4. We have two known letters: E (at position 4) and R (somewhere, but not at 2 or 3, and not at 4 because that's E, so only positions 1 or 5).

Now, we need to make a third guess. The goal is to find the entire word.

We know:
  Position 4: E

And R must be at position 1 or 5.

We also need to find the letters for positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 (but note: if R is at 1, then position 5 is open, and vice versa).

We should choose a word that:
  - Has E at position 4 (fixed).
  - Includes R at either position 1 or 5 (we don't know which, so we can try one of them and see).
  - Uses only letters that we haven't eliminated. Eliminated letters: C, A, N, S, T, P.

What letters are available? We have the entire alphabet minus the eliminated ones. But we should focus on common letters.

Eliminated: C, A, N, S, T, P.

So available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: We have E (already placed), and the other vowels are I, O, U. Note: A is eliminated.

We also know that the word must contain R (either at 1 or 5) and E (at 4).

We can consider two cases for R: at position 1 or at position 5.

But we don't know which, so we might design a guess that can help us determine that.

Alternatively, we can try to cover both possibilities by including R in one of the positions and testing other letters for the rest.

However, we have only 4 guesses left, so we need to be efficient.

Let me think of words that have E at position 4 and R at either 1 or 5.

Case 1: R at position 1
  Then the word is: R _ _ E _
  We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5.

Case 2: R at position 5
  Then the word is: _ _ _ E R

We can try to guess a word that has R at position 1 and then another word that has R at position 5? But we can only guess one word now.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't have R at 1 or 5, but that wouldn't help because we know R is in the word and must be at 1 or 5. So we must put R at either 1 or 5 in our guess to test.

But note: if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it's not, then we know R must be at 5. Similarly, if we put R at 5 and it's correct, we get a check; if not, then R must be at 1.

So we can choose one of the two positions for R and then use the feedback to know.

But we also want to test other letters.

Let me try to form words for each case:

Case 1: R at 1: R _ _ E _
  We need letters for positions 2, 3, 5. We cannot use eliminated letters.

  Some words: 
    RILEY -> R I L E Y -> but Y is at position 5? And we have E at 4. But note: we don't know if Y is in the word. Also, we have to avoid eliminated letters: I, L, Y are not eliminated? 
    But let's check: eliminated are C,A,N,S,T,P. So I, L, Y are available.

    However, ""RILEY"" is a valid word? Yes, but note: we have E at position 4, so the word must be R I L E Y? That's positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:L, 4:E, 5:Y.

    But we don't know if the word has I, L, or Y.

  Another: RIFLE -> R I F L E -> but E is at position 5? We need E at 4. So this doesn't work.

  We need E at 4, so the word must be: R ? ? E ?

  Examples: 
    RIDGE: R I D G E -> but E at 5? Not at 4.
    RINSE: but N and S are eliminated.
    RUMBLE: too long.

  Actually, 5-letter words with E at 4 and R at 1:

    RABBE: but A is eliminated.
    RANGE: A and N eliminated.
    RAREE: A eliminated.

  It's tricky. Let me think:

    RILEY: as above -> R I L E Y -> positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:L, 4:E, 5:Y -> valid.

    Other options: 
      RICED: but C and D? C is eliminated.
      RIFLE: E at 5, not 4.
      RIVET: V and T? T is eliminated.

    How about ""RIPED""? But P is eliminated.

    Another: ""RIPEN"": P and N eliminated.

    ""RIDER"": D and R? But R at 1 and 5? And E at 4? R I D E R -> that would be positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:D, 4:E, 5:R. But we have two R's? We don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we have to avoid eliminated letters: D is available? Yes, because we haven't eliminated D.

    But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and got a dash, meaning at least one R is in the word. But it could be that there are two R's? The feedback doesn't tell us the count. So it's possible.

    However, in ""RIDER"", we have R at position 1 and 5. We don't know if that's allowed. But we can try.

    But we are trying to form a guess for case 1.

    Alternatively, ""RILED"": R I L E D -> positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:L, 4:E, 5:D. This is a valid word.

    So ""RILED"" is a candidate for case 1.

Case 2: R at 5: _ _ _ E R
  We need letters for positions 1,2,3.

  Examples:
    OILER: O I L E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:I, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R -> valid.
    Other: 
      BOXER: O and X? But O and X are available? Eliminated: C,A,N,S,T,P. So B, O, X are available.
      BUT: we have to avoid eliminated letters. ""BOXER"": B O X E R -> valid.
      ""DOPER"": but P is eliminated.
      ""HOMER"": H O M E R -> valid.

  So for case 2, we have words like ""OILER"", ""BOXER"", ""HOMER"".

But we don't know which case we are in. So we need to choose a guess that will help us distinguish.

We can choose a word that has R at position 1 (to test case 1) and then if it's not, we know it's case 2. Or vice versa.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 1 and also includes other common letters for the remaining positions, and if we get a check for R at 1, then we know. If not, then R must be at 5.

Similarly, we could put R at 5 and see.

Let me decide to test R at position 1. Why? Because if we put R at 1 and it's correct, then we get a check and we know. If not, then R must be at 5.

So for the third guess, I will try a word with R at position 1 and E at position 4.

We have a candidate: ""RILED"" -> R I L E D.

But note: we are also testing I, L, D.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has more common letters? But we don't have many common letters left that are not eliminated.

Common letters left: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, U, etc.

""RILED"" uses I, L, D.

Another candidate: ""RIVED"" -> but V is less common? And we have to avoid eliminated letters. V is available.

But ""RIVED"" is a word? Yes, past tense of rive.

But I think ""RILED"" is more common.

Another: ""RIDER"" -> but that has two R's? We don't know if the word has two R's. But if we use ""RIDER"", then we have R at 1 and 5. If the word has only one R, then if R is at 5, then in ""RIDER"" the R at 1 would be a dash (if the word has R only at 5) and the R at 5 would be a check? But we don't know the count.

To avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid duplicate letters for now.

So ""RILED"" is a good choice: R I L E D.

But note: we are testing R at position 1. If we get a check for R, then we know R is at 1. If we get a dash, then R is not at 1, so it must be at 5. And if we get an x, that would mean R is not in the word? But we know R is in the word (from the first guess). So we should get either a check or a dash.

But if we put R at 1 and the word has R at 5, then we would get a dash for R at 1 (because R is in the word but not at 1) and then we would know R is at 5.

So the feedback for R in this guess will tell us:

  - If ✓: then R is at position 1.
  - If -: then R is at position 5 (because that's the only other possibility).

So we can get the position of R from this guess.

Additionally, we will get feedback on I, L, and D.

Therefore, I choose ""RILED"" as the third guess.

But wait: what about the E? In ""RILED"", E is at position 4, which we know is correct. So we should get a check for E again? But we already know E is at 4, so that doesn't give new information. But it's okay.

So let's go with ""RILED"".

But note: we have to avoid eliminated letters. ""RILED"" has R, I, L, E, D. None of these are eliminated (eliminated: C,A,N,S,T,P). So it's safe.

Therefore, the third guess is ""RILED"".

But let me confirm the word: R-I-L-E-D.

Now, we will get feedback on each letter.

We are hoping to get the position of R and also learn about I, L, D.

If we are lucky, we might even get the whole word.

So, the guess is ""RILED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:  
- **E** is confirmed at position 4 (from Guess 2: ""strep"" → E(✓)).  
- **R** is in the word but not at positions 2 or 3 (from Guess 1 and 2). Since position 4 is occupied by E, **R must be at position 1 or 5**.  
- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, S, T, P** (marked ""x"" in feedback).  

For the next guess, I need to:  
1. **Test R's position**: Place R at position 1 to check if it belongs there. If feedback shows R(✓), it confirms position 1; if R(-), it confirms R is at position 5.  
2. **Keep E at position 4** (known correct position).  
3. **Use new, common letters** not yet tested or eliminated (e.g., I, L, D).  
4. **Avoid eliminated letters**.  

I chose **""RILED""** because:  
- **R** is at position 1 (testing the hypothesis).  
- **E** is at position 4 (fixed).  
- **I, L, D** are new, common letters.  
- The word is valid and avoids all eliminated letters.  

This guess will efficiently narrow down R's position and provide new information about I, L, and D.

This is valid.\n\n However, we don\'t know if the word has a P, K, or Y.\n\n Another candidate: ""WROTE"": W, R, O, T, E -> \n   R at position 2? Not allowed.\n\n How about ""WREST"": W, R, E, S, T -> \n   R at position 2? Not allowed.\n\n We see that avoiding R at position 2 is tricky.\n\n Let me list words that have R and E, with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.\n\n Some ideas:\n - R at 1: e.g., ""REBUS"", ""REMIT"", ""REVEL"", ""ROBES"" (but E at 5 in ""ROBES"" is not allowed)\n   For ""REMIT"": R(1), E(2), M(3), I(4), T(5) -> E at 2 is allowed, but E at 2? We don\'t have a restriction on E at 2. However, we have T at 5? That\'s allowed because we only know E is not at 5, but T can be at 5.\n\n   But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. ""REMIT"" avoids them.\n\n   However, we have E at position 2: that\'s a new position. We don\'t know if E is at 2 or not.\n\n - R at 3: e.g., ""TIRED"", ""FIRED"", ""HIRED"", ""WIRED"", ""BARED"" (but A is not allowed) -> so ""TIRED"", ""FIRED"", ""HIRED"", ""WIRED"" are okay? But we must avoid A, C, N. ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D -> no A, C, N.\n\n - R at 4: e.g., ""OPTER"" (not common), ""UTTER"" (but T repeated and E at 5? not allowed) -> hard.\n\n - R at 5: e.g., ""LATER"" (but A is not allowed), ""RACER"" (A and C not allowed) -> not good.\n\n So let\'s choose between ""REMIT"" and ""TIRED"".\n\n Why not ""STREP""? It has R at 3 and E at 4, and uses S, T, P which are common.\n\n I think ""STREP"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places R and E in new positions.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but ""STREP"" has no duplicates.\n\n Alternatively, ""TIRED"" is also good.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n ""STREP"": \n   S (new), T (new), R (known, at position 3), E (known, at position 4), P (new)\n\n ""TIRED"":\n   T (new), I (new), R (known, at position 3), E (known, at position 4), D (new)\n\n Both are good. I\'ll go with ""STREP"" because it has more common consonants.\n\n But note: we have already used S in the first guess? In the first guess we had ""crane"" which had S? No, ""crane"" had C, R, A, N, E. So S is new.\n\n Actually, we haven\'t used S, T, P, I, D, etc.\n\n Since both are valid, I\'ll choose ""STREP"".\n\n However, let me check if ""STREP"" is a valid word: yes.\n\n So second guess: ""STREP""\n\n We\'ll get feedback on this and then adjust.\n\n Therefore, the next guess is ""STREP"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- **R** is in the word but not in position 2.  \n- **E** is in the word but not in position 5.  \n- **C, A, N** are not in the word.  \n\nFor the next guess, I need a word that:  \n1. Includes **R** and **E** (confirmed letters), but avoids placing **R** at position 2 or **E** at position 5.  \n2. Excludes **C, A, N**.  \n3. Tests new common letters (e.g., **S, T, P**) to gather more information.  \n\nI chose **""STREP""** because:  \n- **R** is at position 3 (not 2).  \n- **E** is at position 4 (not 5).  \n- It introduces new letters: **S, T, P**.  \n- It avoids **C, A, N** and reuses known letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>strep</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: strep -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: - (in the word, but not at position 2)\n  A: x (not in the word)\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""strep""\n  S: x (not in the word)\n  T: x (not in the word)\n  R: - (in the word, but not at position 3)  [since it was at position 3 in this guess and got a dash]\n  E: ✓ (in the word and at the correct position, which is position 4)\n  P: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. The letter E is in the word and is at position 4. (Because in ""strep"", E was at position 4 and we got a checkmark.)\n\n2. The letter R is in the word, but it is not at position 2 (from the first guess) and not at position 3 (from the second guess). So R must be at position 1 or 5? But wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n   However, note that position 4 is taken by E. So R cannot be at position 4. Therefore, R must be at position 1 or 5.\n\n3. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, S, T, P.\n\n4. We have two known letters: E (at position 4) and R (somewhere, but not at 2 or 3, and not at 4 because that\'s E, so only positions 1 or 5).\n\nNow, we need to make a third guess. The goal is to find the entire word.\n\nWe know:\n  Position 4: E\n\nAnd R must be at position 1 or 5.\n\nWe also need to find the letters for positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 (but note: if R is at 1, then position 5 is open, and vice versa).\n\nWe should choose a word that:\n  - Has E at position 4 (fixed).\n  - Includes R at either position 1 or 5 (we don\'t know which, so we can try one of them and see).\n  - Uses only letters that we haven\'t eliminated. Eliminated letters: C, A, N, S, T, P.\n\nWhat letters are available? We have the entire alphabet minus the eliminated ones. But we should focus on common letters.\n\nEliminated: C, A, N, S, T, P.\n\nSo available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\nVowels: We have E (already placed), and the other vowels are I, O, U. Note: A is eliminated.\n\nWe also know that the word must contain R (either at 1 or 5) and E (at 4).\n\nWe can consider two cases for R: at position 1 or at position 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know which, so we might design a guess that can help us determine that.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover both possibilities by including R in one of the positions and testing other letters for the rest.\n\nHowever, we have only 4 guesses left, so we need to be efficient.\n\nLet me think of words that have E at position 4 and R at either 1 or 5.\n\nCase 1: R at position 1\n  Then the word is: R _ _ E _\n  We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5.\n\nCase 2: R at position 5\n  Then the word is: _ _ _ E R\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has R at position 1 and then another word that has R at position 5? But we can only guess one word now.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that doesn\'t have R at 1 or 5, but that wouldn\'t help because we know R is in the word and must be at 1 or 5. So we must put R at either 1 or 5 in our guess to test.\n\nBut note: if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it\'s not, then we know R must be at 5. Similarly, if we put R at 5 and it\'s correct, we get a check; if not, then R must be at 1.\n\nSo we can choose one of the two positions for R and then use the feedback to know.\n\nBut we also want to test other letters.\n\nLet me try to form words for each case:\n\nCase 1: R at 1: R _ _ E _\n  We need letters for positions 2, 3, 5. We cannot use eliminated letters.\n\n  Some words: \n    RILEY -> R I L E Y -> but Y is at position 5? And we have E at 4. But note: we don\'t know if Y is in the word. Also, we have to avoid eliminated letters: I, L, Y are not eliminated? \n    But let\'s check: eliminated are C,A,N,S,T,P. So I, L, Y are available.\n\n    However, ""RILEY"" is a valid word? Yes, but note: we have E at position 4, so the word must be R I L E Y? That\'s positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:L, 4:E, 5:Y.\n\n    But we don\'t know if the word has I, L, or Y.\n\n  Another: RIFLE -> R I F L E -> but E is at position 5? We need E at 4. So this doesn\'t work.\n\n  We need E at 4, so the word must be: R ? ? E ?\n\n  Examples: \n    RIDGE: R I D G E -> but E at 5? Not at 4.\n    RINSE: but N and S are eliminated.\n    RUMBLE: too long.\n\n  Actually, 5-letter words with E at 4 and R at 1:\n\n    RABBE: but A is eliminated.\n    RANGE: A and N eliminated.\n    RAREE: A eliminated.\n\n  It\'s tricky. Let me think:\n\n    RILEY: as above -> R I L E Y -> positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:L, 4:E, 5:Y -> valid.\n\n    Other options: \n      RICED: but C and D? C is eliminated.\n      RIFLE: E at 5, not 4.\n      RIVET: V and T? T is eliminated.\n\n    How about ""RIPED""? But P is eliminated.\n\n    Another: ""RIPEN"": P and N eliminated.\n\n    ""RIDER"": D and R? But R at 1 and 5? And E at 4? R I D E R -> that would be positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:D, 4:E, 5:R. But we have two R\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. Also, we have to avoid eliminated letters: D is available? Yes, because we haven\'t eliminated D.\n\n    But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and got a dash, meaning at least one R is in the word. But it could be that there are two R\'s? The feedback doesn\'t tell us the count. So it\'s possible.\n\n    However, in ""RIDER"", we have R at position 1 and 5. We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. But we can try.\n\n    But we are trying to form a guess for case 1.\n\n    Alternatively, ""RILED"": R I L E D -> positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:L, 4:E, 5:D. This is a valid word.\n\n    So ""RILED"" is a candidate for case 1.\n\nCase 2: R at 5: _ _ _ E R\n  We need letters for positions 1,2,3.\n\n  Examples:\n    OILER: O I L E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:I, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R -> valid.\n    Other: \n      BOXER: O and X? But O and X are available? Eliminated: C,A,N,S,T,P. So B, O, X are available.\n      BUT: we have to avoid eliminated letters. ""BOXER"": B O X E R -> valid.\n      ""DOPER"": but P is eliminated.\n      ""HOMER"": H O M E R -> valid.\n\n  So for case 2, we have words like ""OILER"", ""BOXER"", ""HOMER"".\n\nBut we don\'t know which case we are in. So we need to choose a guess that will help us distinguish.\n\nWe can choose a word that has R at position 1 (to test case 1) and then if it\'s not, we know it\'s case 2. Or vice versa.\n\nBut we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 1 and also includes other common letters for the remaining positions, and if we get a check for R at 1, then we know. If not, then R must be at 5.\n\nSimilarly, we could put R at 5 and see.\n\nLet me decide to test R at position 1. Why? Because if we put R at 1 and it\'s correct, then we get a check and we know. If not, then R must be at 5.\n\nSo for the third guess, I will try a word with R at position 1 and E at position 4.\n\nWe have a candidate: ""RILED"" -> R I L E D.\n\nBut note: we are also testing I, L, D.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that has more common letters? But we don\'t have many common letters left that are not eliminated.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, U, etc.\n\n""RILED"" uses I, L, D.\n\nAnother candidate: ""RIVED"" -> but V is less common? And we have to avoid eliminated letters. V is available.\n\nBut ""RIVED"" is a word? Yes, past tense of rive.\n\nBut I think ""RILED"" is more common.\n\nAnother: ""RIDER"" -> but that has two R\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. But if we use ""RIDER"", then we have R at 1 and 5. If the word has only one R, then if R is at 5, then in ""RIDER"" the R at 1 would be a dash (if the word has R only at 5) and the R at 5 would be a check? But we don\'t know the count.\n\nTo avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid duplicate letters for now.\n\nSo ""RILED"" is a good choice: R I L E D.\n\nBut note: we are testing R at position 1. If we get a check for R, then we know R is at 1. If we get a dash, then R is not at 1, so it must be at 5. And if we get an x, that would mean R is not in the word? But we know R is in the word (from the first guess). So we should get either a check or a dash.\n\nBut if we put R at 1 and the word has R at 5, then we would get a dash for R at 1 (because R is in the word but not at 1) and then we would know R is at 5.\n\nSo the feedback for R in this guess will tell us:\n\n  - If ✓: then R is at position 1.\n  - If -: then R is at position 5 (because that\'s the only other possibility).\n\nSo we can get the position of R from this guess.\n\nAdditionally, we will get feedback on I, L, and D.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""RILED"" as the third guess.\n\nBut wait: what about the E? In ""RILED"", E is at position 4, which we know is correct. So we should get a check for E again? But we already know E is at 4, so that doesn\'t give new information. But it\'s okay.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""RILED"".\n\nBut note: we have to avoid eliminated letters. ""RILED"" has R, I, L, E, D. None of these are eliminated (eliminated: C,A,N,S,T,P). So it\'s safe.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""RILED"".\n\nBut let me confirm the word: R-I-L-E-D.\n\nNow, we will get feedback on each letter.\n\nWe are hoping to get the position of R and also learn about I, L, D.\n\nIf we are lucky, we might even get the whole word.\n\nSo, the guess is ""RILED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:  \n- **E** is confirmed at position 4 (from Guess 2: ""strep"" → E(✓)).  \n- **R** is in the word but not at positions 2 or 3 (from Guess 1 and 2). Since position 4 is occupied by E, **R must be at position 1 or 5**.  \n- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, S, T, P** (marked ""x"" in feedback).  \n\nFor the next guess, I need to:  \n1. **Test R\'s position**: Place R at position 1 to check if it belongs there. If feedback shows R(✓), it confirms position 1; if R(-), it confirms R is at position 5.  \n2. **Keep E at position 4** (known correct position).  \n3. **Use new, common letters** not yet tested or eliminated (e.g., I, L, D).  \n4. **Avoid eliminated letters**.  \n\nI chose **""RILED""** because:  \n- **R** is at position 1 (testing the hypothesis).  \n- **E** is at position 4 (fixed).  \n- **I, L, D** are new, common letters.  \n- The word is valid and avoids all eliminated letters.  \n\nThis guess will efficiently narrow down R\'s position and provide new information about I, L, and D.\n\n<guess>riled</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: strep -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) R(-) E(✓) P(x)\nGuess 3: riled -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) L(x) E(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the third guess ""riled"":
  R(✓) -> R is correct and in position 1.
  I(✓) -> I is correct and in position 2.
  L(x) -> L is not in the word.
  E(✓) -> E is correct and in position 4 (we already knew this, but now confirmed again).
  D(x) -> D is not in the word.

So now we know:
  Position 1: R
  Position 2: I
  Position 4: E
  And L and D are not in the word.

Also, from previous guesses, we know that the word does not contain: C, A, N, S, T, P, L, D.

We need to find the letters for position 3 and position 5.

The word so far: R I ? E ?

We know the missing letters must be two letters that are not in the eliminated set.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, S, T, P, L, D.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that the word must contain only one more occurrence of any letter? We don't know, but so far we have R, I, E, and two more.

We have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any repeats so far, and we haven't seen any feedback indicating duplicates. However, we cannot rule it out.

But to be safe, we assume the two missing letters are distinct and not in the eliminated set.

We also know from the first guess that E was not at position 5, but now we have E at position 4, so position 5 is open and can be any letter except E? Actually, the feedback from the first guess only said that E is not at position 5, but it could be that the word has another E? But in the third guess, we have E at 4 and we don't have any indication of another E. However, we don't know for sure.

But note: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and got a dash, meaning that E is in the word but not at 5. That E could be the same E that we now have at position 4. So there might be only one E.

Similarly, for R: we have R at position 1, and in the first guess R was at position 2 and got a dash, which is consistent because it's the same R but wrong position then. So likely only one R.

So we assume no duplicates for now.

Therefore, we need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 5 from the available set.

Now, we need to make a fourth guess. We can try to guess the entire word by filling positions 3 and 5 with two letters from the available set.

But we have many possibilities. We need to choose a word that is valid and tests the possibilities.

We can list possible words that start with ""RI"", have E at the fourth position, and end with a letter from the available set, and the third letter also from the available set.

The word pattern: R I ? E ?

We need to fill the third and fifth positions.

Possible words:

- RIBEY? Not a word.
- RICEY? But C is eliminated.
- RIDGY? D is eliminated.
- RIFLE? But L is eliminated and E is at 5? But we need E at 4, and in RIFLE, E is at 5. Also, L is eliminated.
- RIGOR? But O at 3 and R at 5? But we have R at 1, and if we put R at 5, that would be two R's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, G and O are available. But ""RIGOR"" has two R's and O and G. But we have to check: positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:G, 4:O? No, we need E at 4. So not.

We need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must be: R I ? E ?

So the fifth letter is the last one.

Let me think of common words:

- RIVEN: R I V E N -> but N is eliminated.
- RIPEN: P and N eliminated.
- RIDER: D is eliminated and we have two R's? But D is eliminated.
- RIVER: R I V E R -> but we have two R's and E at 4. But V is available. However, the last letter is R, which would be position 5. But we already have R at position 1. Is that allowed? The word ""RIVER"" is valid. But we have eliminated D, but not V. However, we also eliminated N, S, T, P, etc. But V is available. But we have two R's? We don't know if the word has two R's. Also, in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and got a dash, which could be for the second R? But we don't know.

But let's check the feedback: in the first guess ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got a dash. If the word is ""RIVER"", then it has R at position 1 and 5. So when we guessed ""crane"" with R at position 2, that R would not match either R in the word? Because the word has R at 1 and 5, so position 2 is not R. So the dash in the first guess for R means that R is in the word but not at position 2, which is consistent with ""RIVER"" having R at 1 and 5.

Similarly, in the second guess ""strep"", we had R at position 3 and got a dash. In ""RIVER"", position 3 is V, so R at position 3 in the guess is not correct, and since there is an R in the word (at 1 and 5), we get a dash. That's consistent.

In the third guess ""riled"", we had R at 1 (correct), I at 2 (correct), L at 3 (which is not in the word, so x), E at 4 (correct), D at 5 (not in the word, so x). For ""RIVER"", position 5 is R, so D is not there, so x is correct.

So ""RIVER"" is a candidate? But we have to check if it uses only available letters. ""RIVER"": R, I, V, E, R. We have R and I and E already, and V is available. But we have two R's. And we have not eliminated V.

But in the feedback for the third guess, we got D(x) and L(x), so D and L are not in the word, which is consistent with ""RIVER"" not having D or L.

But is ""RIVER"" the only possibility? No.

Another possibility: ""RIPER"": but P is eliminated.

""RIDER"": D eliminated.

""RIMED"": M and D? D is eliminated.

""RICEY"": C eliminated.

""RIFLE"": L eliminated.

""RIVET"": T eliminated.

""RIGOL"": G and O? But what is RIGOL? Not common.

""RIMES"": S eliminated.

""RILES"": L and S eliminated.

""RINSE"": N and S eliminated.

""RISEN"": S and N eliminated.

""RIVAL"": A and L eliminated.

""RIVER"" seems a strong candidate.

But are there others?

""RIPED"": P and D eliminated.

""RIVEN"": N eliminated.

""RICED"": C and D eliminated.

""RIPEN"": P and N eliminated.

""RIFER"": F and E? But E is at 4, and if we have ""RIFER"", that would be R I F E R -> positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:F, 4:E, 5:R. So two R's. And F is available.

So ""RIFER"" is also a candidate? But is it a word? I think ""rifer"" is a word (comparative of rife).

Similarly, ""RIVER"" and ""RIFER"" are both candidates.

Also, ""RIBER""? Not a word.

""RIDER"" is out because of D.

""RIPER"" is out because of P.

""RIGOR"": but we need E at 4, so not.

""RIPEN"": not.

So the candidates are ""RIVER"" and ""RIFER"", and maybe ""RIZER"" (not a word) or ""RIMER"" (which is a word, but M is available? ""RIMER"": R I M E R -> two R's and M. But is it a word? Yes, a tool for rimes or a poet. But less common.

But we have to consider that the word might not have two R's. We don't have evidence for two R's, but it's possible.

What if the word has only one R? Then we have R at position 1, and the fifth letter is not R. So we need a word R I ? E ? with the fifth letter not R and not any eliminated letter.

For example:

- RIBEY? Not a word.
- RICHY? C eliminated.
- RIGOL? Not common, and O and L? L is eliminated.
- RIGOR: but no E at 4.
- RILEY: L is eliminated.
- RINDY: N and D eliminated.
- RINKY: N and K? K is available, but not a word.
- RIOJA: O and J? But no E at 4.
- RISKY: S and K? S eliminated.
- RITZY: T and Z? T eliminated.
- RIVAL: A and L eliminated.
- RIVED: D eliminated.

It's hard to find a word without two R's that fits.

Another possibility: ""RIPED"" is out.

What about ""RICEY""? C eliminated.

Or ""RIDGE"": D and G? D eliminated.

""RIFTE"": F and T? T eliminated.

""RIGGE"": G? But not a word.

""RINSE"": N and S eliminated.

So it seems that the only common words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters are those with two R's, like ""RIVER"", ""RIFER"", ""RIMER"", etc.

But we have to choose one for the next guess.

We can try ""RIVER"" because it's a common word.

But note: we have to consider the feedback we got.

In the third guess, we guessed ""riled"" and got R(✓) I(✓) L(x) E(✓) D(x). So the word has R, I, E, and does not have L or D.

Now, for the fourth guess, we can try ""RIVER"".

But let's see what feedback we would get if the word is ""RIVER"":

  Position 1: R -> ✓ (we know)
  Position 2: I -> ✓ (we know)
  Position 3: V -> ? 
  Position 4: E -> ✓ (we know)
  Position 5: R -> ?

But we have two R's. In the word ""RIVER"", the first R is at 1 and the last R is at 5.

If we guess ""RIVER"", then:

  R at 1: ✓ (correct)
  I at 2: ✓ (correct)
  V at 3: if the word is ""RIVER"", then V is at 3, so ✓
  E at 4: ✓ (correct)
  R at 5: ✓ (because the word has R at 5)

So if the word is ""RIVER"", we would get all correct.

But if the word is ""RIFER"", then:

  R at 1: ✓
  I at 2: ✓
  V at 3: but the word has F at 3, so if we guess V, it would be x (if F is not V) or if the letter is not V, then x.
  E at 4: ✓
  R at 5: ✓

So we would get: R(✓) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓) -> but wait, we have two R's in the guess. In ""RIFER"", the word has R at 1 and 5, so the R at 5 is correct. But the V at 3 is not in the word? ""RIFER"" has F at 3, so V is not in the word, so V would be x.

Similarly, if the word is ""RIMER"", then V would be x and R at 5 would be ✓.

So by guessing ""RIVER"", we can distinguish:

  If we get all ✓, then the word is ""RIVER"".
  If we get V(x) and the rest ✓, then the word is not ""RIVER"", but it has R at 5 and the third letter is not V.

But we also have to consider that the word might be something else, like ""RIFER"" or ""RIMER"".

But if we get V(x) and R(✓) at 5, then we know the word has R at 5 and the third letter is not V, so it could be F, M, etc.

But then we would have to guess again.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests multiple possibilities for the third and fifth positions.

But we don't have many guesses left (we have 3 guesses left: 4,5,6), so we can try ""RIVER"".

If it's not ""RIVER"", we get information about the third letter.

But note: we might be able to guess a word that uses a different set of letters to cover more ground.

For example, we could guess a word that has a different letter at position 3 and a different letter at position 5, but that might not be efficient.

Since we have two positions to fill and many possibilities, but the only common words seem to be with two R's, I think ""RIVER"" is a good guess.

So I will go with ""RIVER"".

Therefore, the fourth guess is ""RIVER"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:  
- **R** is at position 1 (from Guess 3: ""riled"" → R(✓)).  
- **I** is at position 2 (from Guess 3: ""riled"" → I(✓)).  
- **E** is at position 4 (from Guess 2: ""strep"" → E(✓), confirmed in Guess 3).  
- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, S, T, P, L, D** (marked ""x"" in feedback).  
- The word pattern is: **R I ? E ?** (positions 3 and 5 unknown).  

Given the constraints:  
- Position 5 cannot be **E** (from Guess 1: E(-) at position 5).  
- The only common words fitting the pattern and avoiding eliminated letters are those ending with **R** (e.g., ""RIVER"", ""RIFER"", ""RIMER""), as other combinations are invalid or use eliminated letters.  

I chose **""RIVER""** because:  
- It tests the common word ""RIVER"", which fits the known pattern.  
- If correct, it solves the puzzle.  
- If incorrect, feedback on **V** and the second **R** will provide critical information (e.g., if **V** is absent, it suggests alternatives like ""RIFER"" or ""RIMER"").  

This guess maximizes efficiency with limited remaining attempts.

Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **R** is confirmed at position 1 (from Guess 3: ""riled"" → R(✓)).
- **I** is confirmed at position 2 (from Guess 3: ""riled"" → I(✓)).
- **E** is confirmed at position 4 (from Guess 2: ""strep"" → E(✓), and confirmed again in Guess 3).
- **L** and **D** are eliminated (from Guess 3: L(x), D(x)).
- Previously eliminated letters: **C, A, N, S, T, P** (from Guesses 1 and 2).
- The word pattern is: **R I ? E ?** (positions 3 and 5 are unknown).

### Key Constraints:
- Position 5 **cannot be E** (from Guess 1: E(-) at position 5).
- The remaining letters must come from the available pool: **B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z** (excluding all eliminated letters).
- Common words fitting this pattern (e.g., ""RIVER"", ""RIFER"", ""RIMER"") suggest that position 5 is likely **R** (since other combinations like ""RIGOR"" or ""RILED"" are invalid due to eliminated letters or incorrect vowel placement).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test **""RIVER""**—a high-probability word that fits the pattern and uses common letters:
  - **V** (position 3) and the second **R** (position 5) are untested letters.
  - If correct, the puzzle is solved.
  - If incorrect, feedback on **V** and **R** will reveal:
    - Whether **R** is at position 5 (if R(✓) at position 5, then the word ends with R).
    - Whether **V** is in the word (if V(-) or V(✓), it narrows position 3 alternatives).

<guess>river</guess>",river,"We have the feedback from the third guess ""riled"":
  R(✓) -> R is correct and in position 1.
  I(✓) -> I is correct and in position 2.
  L(x) -> L is not in the word.
  E(✓) -> E is correct and in position 4 (we already knew this, but now confirmed again).
  D(x) -> D is not in the word.

So now we know:
  Position 1: R
  Position 2: I
  Position 4: E
  And L and D are not in the word.

Also, from previous guesses, we know that the word does not contain: C, A, N, S, T, P, L, D.

We need to find the letters for position 3 and position 5.

The word so far: R I ? E ?

We know the missing letters must be two letters that are not in the eliminated set.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, S, T, P, L, D.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that the word must contain only one more occurrence of any letter? We don't know, but so far we have R, I, E, and two more.

We have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any repeats so far, and we haven't seen any feedback indicating duplicates. However, we cannot rule it out.

But to be safe, we assume the two missing letters are distinct and not in the eliminated set.

We also know from the first guess that E was not at position 5, but now we have E at position 4, so position 5 is open and can be any letter except E? Actually, the feedback from the first guess only said that E is not at position 5, but it could be that the word has another E? But in the third guess, we have E at 4 and we don't have any indication of another E. However, we don't know for sure.

But note: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and got a dash, meaning that E is in the word but not at 5. That E could be the same E that we now have at position 4. So there might be only one E.

Similarly, for R: we have R at position 1, and in the first guess R was at position 2 and got a dash, which is consistent because it's the same R but wrong position then. So likely only one R.

So we assume no duplicates for now.

Therefore, we need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 5 from the available set.

Now, we need to make a fourth guess. We can try to guess the entire word by filling positions 3 and 5 with two letters from the available set.

But we have many possibilities. We need to choose a word that is valid and tests the possibilities.

We can list possible words that start with ""RI"", have E at the fourth position, and end with a letter from the available set, and the third letter also from the available set.

The word pattern: R I ? E ?

We need to fill the third and fifth positions.

Possible words:

- RIBEY? Not a word.
- RICEY? But C is eliminated.
- RIDGY? D is eliminated.
- RIFLE? But L is eliminated and E is at 5? But we need E at 4, and in RIFLE, E is at 5. Also, L is eliminated.
- RIGOR? But O at 3 and R at 5? But we have R at 1, and if we put R at 5, that would be two R's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, G and O are available. But ""RIGOR"" has two R's and O and G. But we have to check: positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:G, 4:O? No, we need E at 4. So not.

We need the fourth letter to be E. So the word must be: R I ? E ?

So the fifth letter is the last one.

Let me think of common words:

- RIVEN: R I V E N -> but N is eliminated.
- RIPEN: P and N eliminated.
- RIDER: D is eliminated and we have two R's? But D is eliminated.
- RIVER: R I V E R -> but we have two R's and E at 4. But V is available. However, the last letter is R, which would be position 5. But we already have R at position 1. Is that allowed? The word ""RIVER"" is valid. But we have eliminated D, but not V. However, we also eliminated N, S, T, P, etc. But V is available. But we have two R's? We don't know if the word has two R's. Also, in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and got a dash, which could be for the second R? But we don't know.

But let's check the feedback: in the first guess ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got a dash. If the word is ""RIVER"", then it has R at position 1 and 5. So when we guessed ""crane"" with R at position 2, that R would not match either R in the word? Because the word has R at 1 and 5, so position 2 is not R. So the dash in the first guess for R means that R is in the word but not at position 2, which is consistent with ""RIVER"" having R at 1 and 5.

Similarly, in the second guess ""strep"", we had R at position 3 and got a dash. In ""RIVER"", position 3 is V, so R at position 3 in the guess is not correct, and since there is an R in the word (at 1 and 5), we get a dash. That's consistent.

In the third guess ""riled"", we had R at 1 (correct), I at 2 (correct), L at 3 (which is not in the word, so x), E at 4 (correct), D at 5 (not in the word, so x). For ""RIVER"", position 5 is R, so D is not there, so x is correct.

So ""RIVER"" is a candidate? But we have to check if it uses only available letters. ""RIVER"": R, I, V, E, R. We have R and I and E already, and V is available. But we have two R's. And we have not eliminated V.

But in the feedback for the third guess, we got D(x) and L(x), so D and L are not in the word, which is consistent with ""RIVER"" not having D or L.

But is ""RIVER"" the only possibility? No.

Another possibility: ""RIPER"": but P is eliminated.

""RIDER"": D eliminated.

""RIMED"": M and D? D is eliminated.

""RICEY"": C eliminated.

""RIFLE"": L eliminated.

""RIVET"": T eliminated.

""RIGOL"": G and O? But what is RIGOL? Not common.

""RIMES"": S eliminated.

""RILES"": L and S eliminated.

""RINSE"": N and S eliminated.

""RISEN"": S and N eliminated.

""RIVAL"": A and L eliminated.

""RIVER"" seems a strong candidate.

But are there others?

""RIPED"": P and D eliminated.

""RIVEN"": N eliminated.

""RICED"": C and D eliminated.

""RIPEN"": P and N eliminated.

""RIFER"": F and E? But E is at 4, and if we have ""RIFER"", that would be R I F E R -> positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:F, 4:E, 5:R. So two R's. And F is available.

So ""RIFER"" is also a candidate? But is it a word? I think ""rifer"" is a word (comparative of rife).

Similarly, ""RIVER"" and ""RIFER"" are both candidates.

Also, ""RIBER""? Not a word.

""RIDER"" is out because of D.

""RIPER"" is out because of P.

""RIGOR"": but we need E at 4, so not.

""RIPEN"": not.

So the candidates are ""RIVER"" and ""RIFER"", and maybe ""RIZER"" (not a word) or ""RIMER"" (which is a word, but M is available? ""RIMER"": R I M E R -> two R's and M. But is it a word? Yes, a tool for rimes or a poet. But less common.

But we have to consider that the word might not have two R's. We don't have evidence for two R's, but it's possible.

What if the word has only one R? Then we have R at position 1, and the fifth letter is not R. So we need a word R I ? E ? with the fifth letter not R and not any eliminated letter.

For example:

- RIBEY? Not a word.
- RICHY? C eliminated.
- RIGOL? Not common, and O and L? L is eliminated.
- RIGOR: but no E at 4.
- RILEY: L is eliminated.
- RINDY: N and D eliminated.
- RINKY: N and K? K is available, but not a word.
- RIOJA: O and J? But no E at 4.
- RISKY: S and K? S eliminated.
- RITZY: T and Z? T eliminated.
- RIVAL: A and L eliminated.
- RIVED: D eliminated.

It's hard to find a word without two R's that fits.

Another possibility: ""RIPED"" is out.

What about ""RICEY""? C eliminated.

Or ""RIDGE"": D and G? D eliminated.

""RIFTE"": F and T? T eliminated.

""RIGGE"": G? But not a word.

""RINSE"": N and S eliminated.

So it seems that the only common words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters are those with two R's, like ""RIVER"", ""RIFER"", ""RIMER"", etc.

But we have to choose one for the next guess.

We can try ""RIVER"" because it's a common word.

But note: we have to consider the feedback we got.

In the third guess, we guessed ""riled"" and got R(✓) I(✓) L(x) E(✓) D(x). So the word has R, I, E, and does not have L or D.

Now, for the fourth guess, we can try ""RIVER"".

But let's see what feedback we would get if the word is ""RIVER"":

  Position 1: R -> ✓ (we know)
  Position 2: I -> ✓ (we know)
  Position 3: V -> ? 
  Position 4: E -> ✓ (we know)
  Position 5: R -> ?

But we have two R's. In the word ""RIVER"", the first R is at 1 and the last R is at 5.

If we guess ""RIVER"", then:

  R at 1: ✓ (correct)
  I at 2: ✓ (correct)
  V at 3: if the word is ""RIVER"", then V is at 3, so ✓
  E at 4: ✓ (correct)
  R at 5: ✓ (because the word has R at 5)

So if the word is ""RIVER"", we would get all correct.

But if the word is ""RIFER"", then:

  R at 1: ✓
  I at 2: ✓
  V at 3: but the word has F at 3, so if we guess V, it would be x (if F is not V) or if the letter is not V, then x.
  E at 4: ✓
  R at 5: ✓

So we would get: R(✓) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓) -> but wait, we have two R's in the guess. In ""RIFER"", the word has R at 1 and 5, so the R at 5 is correct. But the V at 3 is not in the word? ""RIFER"" has F at 3, so V is not in the word, so V would be x.

Similarly, if the word is ""RIMER"", then V would be x and R at 5 would be ✓.

So by guessing ""RIVER"", we can distinguish:

  If we get all ✓, then the word is ""RIVER"".
  If we get V(x) and the rest ✓, then the word is not ""RIVER"", but it has R at 5 and the third letter is not V.

But we also have to consider that the word might be something else, like ""RIFER"" or ""RIMER"".

But if we get V(x) and R(✓) at 5, then we know the word has R at 5 and the third letter is not V, so it could be F, M, etc.

But then we would have to guess again.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests multiple possibilities for the third and fifth positions.

But we don't have many guesses left (we have 3 guesses left: 4,5,6), so we can try ""RIVER"".

If it's not ""RIVER"", we get information about the third letter.

But note: we might be able to guess a word that uses a different set of letters to cover more ground.

For example, we could guess a word that has a different letter at position 3 and a different letter at position 5, but that might not be efficient.

Since we have two positions to fill and many possibilities, but the only common words seem to be with two R's, I think ""RIVER"" is a good guess.

So I will go with ""RIVER"".

Therefore, the fourth guess is ""RIVER"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:  
- **R** is at position 1 (from Guess 3: ""riled"" → R(✓)).  
- **I** is at position 2 (from Guess 3: ""riled"" → I(✓)).  
- **E** is at position 4 (from Guess 2: ""strep"" → E(✓), confirmed in Guess 3).  
- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, S, T, P, L, D** (marked ""x"" in feedback).  
- The word pattern is: **R I ? E ?** (positions 3 and 5 unknown).  

Given the constraints:  
- Position 5 cannot be **E** (from Guess 1: E(-) at position 5).  
- The only common words fitting the pattern and avoiding eliminated letters are those ending with **R** (e.g., ""RIVER"", ""RIFER"", ""RIMER""), as other combinations are invalid or use eliminated letters.  

I chose **""RIVER""** because:  
- It tests the common word ""RIVER"", which fits the known pattern.  
- If correct, it solves the puzzle.  
- If incorrect, feedback on **V** and the second **R** will provide critical information (e.g., if **V** is absent, it suggests alternatives like ""RIFER"" or ""RIMER"").  

This guess maximizes efficiency with limited remaining attempts.
