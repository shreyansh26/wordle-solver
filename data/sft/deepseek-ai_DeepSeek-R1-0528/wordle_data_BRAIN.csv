We are starting the game. We don't have any prior feedback, so we need to make the first guess.
 A good first guess usually uses common letters and covers five distinct letters to maximize information.
 Common vowels and consonants are often chosen.

 Some common starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, SALET, etc.

 Considering that:
 - We want to include common letters and have a mix of vowels and consonants.

 Let's choose a word that has two vowels and three consonants, covering frequent letters.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"":
 C - common consonant
 R - common consonant
 A - common vowel
 N - common consonant
 E - common vowel

 Alternatively, ""SALET"" or ""SLATE"" are also good.

 However, note that we are playing in English and the word must be valid.

 Let me pick ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

We are given the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(-) E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the secret word (x)
 - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (2nd letter) (✓)
 - A is in the secret word and in the correct position (3rd letter) (✓)
 - N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position (-)
 - E is not in the secret word (x)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the form: _ R A _ _ 
   because R is in position 2 and A in position 3.

 - The letters C and E are not in the word at all.

 - The letter N is in the word but not in the 4th position. So it must be in position 1 or 5? 
   But note: the word is 5 letters and we have positions 1,4,5 unknown. However, since N is present but not in position 4, it must be in either position 1 or 5.

 Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] R A [letter4] [letter5]
 where:
   letter1 can be any letter except C and E (and any other letters we know are absent? so far only C and E are ruled out), but it might be N? 
   letter4 cannot be N (because feedback says N is in the word but not in position 4), and also cannot be C or E. 
   letter5 cannot be C or E, but if N is in the word and not in the 4th, then N must be in position 1 or 5.

 So possibilities for letter1: It could be N? Or another letter? But note that N is present somewhere. Since it's not in position 4, and position 2 and 3 are fixed, it must be in 1 or 5.

 Now, we need to form a new 5-letter word that:
 - Has R in the 2nd position and A in the 3rd position (because we have ✓ for both and they must be kept)
 - Does not contain C or E (because both ruled out by x)
 - Contains N (because we got - for N meaning it's in the word) but not in the 4th position.

 So the new word should be of the form: [N or other] R A [not N] [if not N in 1 then must be N in 5]

 But wait: we also want to test for other letters to figure out the missing ones.

 Strategy: We know the word has R in position 2, A in position 3, and an N that is either in position 1 or 5.

 We also have two other letters to find: letter4 and either letter1 (if N is in 5) or letter5 (if N is in 1).

 We should try to guess a word that:
 - Uses common letters to maximize information
 - And fits the constraints.

 Since the word must have R and A fixed, and N must be present but not in position 4, we can try two cases.

 However, note that we don't have to fix N yet because we can test both possibilities with a word that has N among the possibilities? 

 Let me think of common words that fit the pattern:

 Pattern: _ R A _ _

 We know the first letter can be a letter that is not C or E, and the fourth and fifth similarly without C and E. Also, we know one of position1 or position5 must be N? But not necessarily: wait, N is somewhere else. Actually, N could also be in position 5? Yes, because the 5th position is unknown.

 Let me list possible letters for each position:
 - Position1: all letters except C, E -> but note that we have an N to place? Actually, the N could be in position 5? So position1 cannot be E or C, but might be anything else including N? However, if N is not in position1, then it must be in position5.

 How about we try to guess a word that has N in either position1 or position5? And then use other common letters for the remaining.

 Example words:
 - If we put N in position1: N R A _ _
   Then we have two blanks: positions 4 and 5.
   We need a valid word: e.g., ""NRA_something"". What words? 
   Possibilities: 
     ""NRAIL""? -> not a word? 
     ""NRAIN""? -> but same as crane pattern? no? 
     ""NRAJA"" -> not English?
     ""NRAKE"" -> but E is eliminated? we cannot use E.
   Let's try without E: 
     Perhaps ""NRAIN""? But that uses two N's? But that might be possible.

   Wait, note: the feedback for ""crane"" had N in the word but not in the 4th position. If we place N at position1 then the word must have at least one N. It can have more? But we don't know. 

   Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters unless we have them in the guess? So we have to be cautious.

   Common words? ""BRAIN"" -> but we don't have B as a constraint? no, we don't know about B? But wait, we must avoid C and E.

   Let me brainstorm words with the pattern [letter] R A [letter] [letter], avoiding C and E:

   Some possibilities:
     - ""DRAMA"": D R A M A -> then check: 
         D: not tested before? 
         M: tested in crane? crane had M? no, crane was C R A N E. Only C,R,A,N,E were tested. 
         A is repeated? 
     - ""BRAVA"": B R A V A -> valid? 
     - ""TRAIN"": T R A I N -> has T, I, N? 
     - ""GRAIN"": G R A I N
     - ""DRAIN"": D R A I N -> has D and I? 

   Also, note: N must be in the word? So the word must have one N? But if we choose ""BRAVO"", it doesn't have N? So that would be invalid because we know the secret word has N (from the feedback of crane).

   Therefore, our next word must include the letter N? Yes, because we know N is in the secret word.

   Also, we cannot use C or E.

   So let's look for words that have N and fit the pattern _ R A _ _ and do not contain C or E.

   Possibilities:
     ""BRAIN"" -> B R A I N: 
        Position 1: B (allowed? yes, we don't know about B) 
        Position 4: I
        Position 5: N -> so N is at the end? which is allowed? because we can have N at position 5? since the feedback said N is in the word but not at position 4.

     ""DRAIN"": D R A I N -> same structure.

     ""GRAIN"": G R A I N

     ""TRAIN"": T R A I N

     ""STRAIN""? -> too long? 6 letters? so no, must be 5.

     ""BRAWN"": B R A W N -> has W? 
        Then W is new? 
        But also N at the end? valid.

     ""DRAWN"": D R A W N

   How to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible? We have positions 1,4,5 to figure out. Also, we know the word must have N, so if we don't put N in the word again, we lose the chance to test it? Actually, we must include N? because the word must contain N? 

   But note: we are trying to figure out where the N goes? Since we know it is either in position1 or 5? 

   Option 1: We put N in position1? to test if it is at the beginning? Then we can try a word starting with N and having R A and then two more new letters? But then the word must not have E or C.

   Example: 
     ""NRATS"" -> not a word?
     ""NRAMA"" -> not a word? 
     ""NRAJA"" -> not valid.

   It's hard to find a word starting with N followed by RA? 

   Alternatively, we can put N at the end? 

   Since it's more common to find words ending with N? like ""TRAIN"", ""GRAIN"", etc.

   How about we try ""TRAIN""?

   Let me check: we have T at the beginning? which is new? and I at the fourth position? Also N at the end? 

   Then if the feedback we get:

     If the word is ""TRAIN"":
        T: if it's in the secret word? we don't know? 
        R: ✓ (already known)
        A: ✓ (already known)
        I: ? 
        N: if we get ✓ for N? then that would tell us the secret word ends with N? But wait: the secret word has N? but which position? we had N in the 4th position in crane? now we put N in 5th? 

   Alternatively, we might try a word that has N in the first position? Let me see if such words exist? 

     ""NRAZD""? not a word.
     ""NRAHZ""? no.

   Actually, there are words like ""NRAKS""? not a word. 

   After checking, common words with pattern:
     ""NRA"" at the start: 
        ""NRA? not found.""

   So probably N is at the end? So let's go with a word ending with N? 

   How about ""BRAWN""? It uses W? which is uncommon? 

   Alternatively, let's consider the word ""DRAIN"". It uses D and I? which are common? 

   Another possibility: we can also use letters that are common and not tried before? to catch more possibilities.

   In the first guess, we used: C, R, A, N, E. So letters tested: C, R, A, N, E.

   Now let's avoid reusing C and E? but R and A are fixed? So we have to use R and A in the same positions.

   We are forced to use R and A? 

   We also must use N? because it is present? and we don't know where? 

   Since we are forced to use R and A, and we know the word has N? 

   Let me pick ""TRAIN"": 
        T is new? 
        R, A -> known? 
        I -> new? 
        N -> known present? but in which position? 

   But note: if the secret word has N only at position5? That would be consistent? But what if the secret word has two N's? and one in position1? then putting N at position5 would give us a ✓ for N? and the T and I would give us information.

   However, we don't know? 

   Alternatively, how about we try a word that has N at position5? and uses a common pattern? 

   I think ""TRAIN"" is a good candidate? But let's check if there are other constraints? 

   Also, we must pick a valid English word.

   So let's try ""TRAIN"": 

     Pattern: T R A I N

     We'll get feedback:

        T: ? 
        R: ✓ (we know) -> will be ✓ again? 
        A: ✓ 
        I: ? 
        N: ... here, if the secret word has N at the end? then ✓? but what if the secret word has N only at position1? Then we are putting N at the end? which is not the position? so it would be '-'? meaning it's in the word but wrong position? 

        However, note: the secret word has N somewhere? if not in position4? but if it has N at position1? then our guess having N at position5? would get '-' because the letter N exists but not at position5? Actually, no? if the secret word has N at position1? then when we put N at position5? we should get '-' for N? meaning ""in the word but not at this position"".

        But wait: if we get ✓ for R and A? and then for N we get ✓? that would mean the secret word has N at position5? 

        So the feedback will tell us the position of N? 

        Also, we can test T and I? 

        This is good? 

   However, what if the secret word has two N's? For instance, in position1 and position5? Then we would get ✓ for N? but also for the N at position1? that would be unknown? Actually, our guess ""TRAIN"" has N only at the end? so the feedback would only mark the N at the end? 

   But note: the rules don't do duplicate marking? Actually, let's recall how duplicate letters are handled? 

   Typically, in such games? The feedback marks each letter only if it matches? However, duplicate handling? 

   But in our rules? It says: ""Each letter in your guess"" so each letter? But the example doesn't have duplicates? 

   Since the example doesn't duplicate? let me assume that the feedback marks each occurrence individually? 

   But the rules state: ""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was."" per letter? 

   However, if the secret word has duplicate letters? and your guess has duplicate? the marking is done independently? 

   Example: Secret: APPLE? Guess: PAPER? 
        First P: if it is in the secret? but the secret has two P? 

   But in our case: we have an example? Actually, the rules don't specify duplicates? However, since we are building an AI? we must assume that the feedback will mark for each letter independently, using the following rule:

   How duplicates are handled? 
        Typically:
        The feedback:
            First, mark the exact matches (✓)
            Then, for the remaining letters? mark yellow if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret? but not double-counting.

   Therefore, we have to be cautious? 

   But in our guess ""TRAIN"": 
        If N appears only once in the secret? and we put N at the end? and it's not the position? then it's '-'? 
        If N appears only once at the end? then ✓? 

   Also, if N appears twice? then we might get ✓ at the end? and also mark the other N? but note we didn't put another N? So we only mark the one instance.

   Alternatively, if N is at position1? and we put N at the end? then the feedback for N would be '-' because it exists but not at the end? 

   So either way, we'll learn where N is? 

   Also, we test T and I? 

   Therefore, ""TRAIN"" seems a good word? 

   Another candidate: ""BRAIN"", ""DRAIN"", ""GRAIN"", ""FRAUD""? wait, FRAUD does not have N? so invalid? because we must have N? 

   Or ""PRANK""? but that doesn't have RA fixed? wait, no: we must have the second letter R and third letter A? 

   So ""PRANK"" -> pattern P R A N K? 
        Then position1: P? 
        position2: R? -> ✓? 
        position3: A? -> ✓? 
        position4: N? -> but wait: we already know that N is in the word? but the feedback told us not to put N at position4? because in crane we had N at position4? which got '-'. Then why would we put N again at position4? 

   Actually, we cannot? because the secret word does not have N at position4? so if we put N at position4? then we would get '-' ONLY if there is another N? because it would be in the word but not at position4? what if the secret word has only one N? then putting N at position4? that's the only N? then it would have to be x? because it's not in the word at any other position? but wait? yes? because it is in the word? but in a different position? 

   Actually, no: the feedback says N is present? so it should be '-'? regardless? because it is in the word? just not at the correct position? 

   But: the rules? 
        '-' means ""the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position""

   So if we guess N at position4? and the secret word has N at position1? then we get '-'? 
   If we guess N at position4? and the secret word has only that one N? but it is at position1? then we get '-'? 
   But in our case? we specifically know that N is not at position4? because we already tried crane which had N at position4? and it was marked as in the word but wrong position? so the secret word N is definitely not at position4? 

   But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate N? and one is at position4? and one elsewhere? Then when we guessed crane? the N at position4? could have been marked as '-'? because there is an N at position4? but maybe the feedback rules? Actually, the rules don't say? 

   However, the feedback for crane: N(-) means that N is present? AND at least it is not in the correct position? so that's the same? 

   But if the secret word has two N's? and one at position4? then when we guessed crane? we put an N at position4? and it would be ✓? not '-'? because it is in the correct position? 

   Therefore, since we got '-'? that indicates the N in crane was correct as presence? but not in the position? so the secret word does NOT have an N at position4? at all? 

   So why would we put an N at position4 in the next guess? It would be redundant? and also, we know the secret word does not have N at position4? so if we put N at position4? we would get '-'? meaning it is in the word? but not at position4? which we already know? That gives us no extra information? and wastes an opportunity to test a new letter? 

   Therefore, we should avoid putting N at position4? 

   So in the pattern? for the fourth position? we should not put N? 

   Similarly, for the fifth position? we might put N? 

   Similarly, for the first position? we might put N? 

   So going back: 

   We can choose a word that:

      Option A: N at position1? then the word: N R A [letter4] [letter5]? avoiding E and C? and avoid N at position4? 

         But we don't know? and we must have at least one N? which we have? 

         Words? ""NRAIA""? not a word? 

         ""NRAIS""? not a word? 

         ""NRAHA""? not a word? 

         ""NRAYS"": also not? 

         There don't seem to be common words? 

      Option B: put N at position5? 

         Then we try words like ... R A ? N? 

         Then we have positions4? which cannot be N? and position1? which cannot be E or C? 

         Words: many? ""TRAIN"", ""BRAIN"", ""GRAIN"", ""DRAIN"", ""BRAWN"", etc.

   Since ""TRAIN"" is a common word? and uses T and I? which are new? we can try ""TRAIN"".

   But note: what if the secret word has T? We don't know? So by guessing ""TRAIN""? we test T and I? and learn? 

   Alternatively, if we want to test more vowels? I is a vowel? 

   Also, note we have eliminated E? so if the secret word has an I? that would be good to know? 

   I think ""TRAIN"" is reasonable.

   Another alternative: ""PRANK""? but that breaks the pattern? because we have R and A locked? so it must be second and third? wait, no: ""PRANK"" is P R A N K? so that fits? 

   But ""PRANK"" has P, A (already known), R (known), N (known), and K? 
        Position1: P? 
        Position2: R? ✓
        Position3: A? ✓
        Position4: N? but wait: we just reasoned we shouldn't put N at position4? because we know the secret word doesn't have N there? so it will get '-'? which tells us nothing? 

        Position5: K? 

   But we are now testing fewer new letters? because we test P, K? and reuse N? Also, we know that in this word N is at the fourth position? which we know is wrong? so we'll get '-'? 

   Whereas in ""TRAIN""? we test two new letters: T and I? and put N in a new position? that we are unsure of? 

   So ""TRAIN"" is better? 

   Therefore, we choose ""TRAIN"".

   Let me confirm: 

        The secret word has the form: _ R A _ _ 

        We are guessing: T R A I N

        Feedback possibilities? 

        We know R and A will be ✓.

        For T: if it is in the word? then if at position1? ✓? if elsewhere? '-'? if not? x? 

        For I: same? either ✓, '-', or x? 

        For N: 
            Either ✓? if the secret word has N at position5? 
            Or '-'? if the secret word has N at position1? 
            Or if the secret word has N somewhere else? like position5? ✓? position1? '-'? 

        And note: we know the secret word doesn't have E or C? and we haven't introduced them? 

   Therefore, let's guess ""TRAIN"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- Letters **C** and **E** are absent (✓ feedback: x), so they are excluded from future guesses.  
- **R** is in the correct position (2nd) and **A** is in the correct position (3rd), so the secret word format is `_ R A _ _`.  
- **N** is present but not in the 4th position (✓ feedback: -), meaning it must be in position 1 or 5.  

For the next guess:  
- I need a valid 5-letter word that fits `_ R A _ _`.  
- The word must include **N** (since it’s confirmed present) but avoid placing it in the 4th position.  
- Exclude **C** and **E**, and prioritize testing new letters to gather more information.  

""TRAIN"" is an optimal choice:  
- Fits the format (`T R A I N`).  
- Places **N** in position 5 (tests the possibility that N ends the word, or if not, verifies it must be in position 1).  
- Introduces **T** (new letter at position 1) and **I** (new letter at position 4) to test their presence/positions.  
- Avoids **C**, **E**, and reuses confirmed **R** and **A** correctly.  

This guess maximizes information about the unknown positions while adhering to constraints.  

<guess>train</guess>",train,"We are given the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(-) E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the secret word (x)
 - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (2nd letter) (✓)
 - A is in the secret word and in the correct position (3rd letter) (✓)
 - N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position (-)
 - E is not in the secret word (x)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the form: _ R A _ _ 
   because R is in position 2 and A in position 3.

 - The letters C and E are not in the word at all.

 - The letter N is in the word but not in the 4th position. So it must be in position 1 or 5? 
   But note: the word is 5 letters and we have positions 1,4,5 unknown. However, since N is present but not in position 4, it must be in either position 1 or 5.

 Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] R A [letter4] [letter5]
 where:
   letter1 can be any letter except C and E (and any other letters we know are absent? so far only C and E are ruled out), but it might be N? 
   letter4 cannot be N (because feedback says N is in the word but not in position 4), and also cannot be C or E. 
   letter5 cannot be C or E, but if N is in the word and not in the 4th, then N must be in position 1 or 5.

 So possibilities for letter1: It could be N? Or another letter? But note that N is present somewhere. Since it's not in position 4, and position 2 and 3 are fixed, it must be in 1 or 5.

 Now, we need to form a new 5-letter word that:
 - Has R in the 2nd position and A in the 3rd position (because we have ✓ for both and they must be kept)
 - Does not contain C or E (because both ruled out by x)
 - Contains N (because we got - for N meaning it's in the word) but not in the 4th position.

 So the new word should be of the form: [N or other] R A [not N] [if not N in 1 then must be N in 5]

 But wait: we also want to test for other letters to figure out the missing ones.

 Strategy: We know the word has R in position 2, A in position 3, and an N that is either in position 1 or 5.

 We also have two other letters to find: letter4 and either letter1 (if N is in 5) or letter5 (if N is in 1).

 We should try to guess a word that:
 - Uses common letters to maximize information
 - And fits the constraints.

 Since the word must have R and A fixed, and N must be present but not in position 4, we can try two cases.

 However, note that we don't have to fix N yet because we can test both possibilities with a word that has N among the possibilities? 

 Let me think of common words that fit the pattern:

 Pattern: _ R A _ _

 We know the first letter can be a letter that is not C or E, and the fourth and fifth similarly without C and E. Also, we know one of position1 or position5 must be N? But not necessarily: wait, N is somewhere else. Actually, N could also be in position 5? Yes, because the 5th position is unknown.

 Let me list possible letters for each position:
 - Position1: all letters except C, E -> but note that we have an N to place? Actually, the N could be in position 5? So position1 cannot be E or C, but might be anything else including N? However, if N is not in position1, then it must be in position5.

 How about we try to guess a word that has N in either position1 or position5? And then use other common letters for the remaining.

 Example words:
 - If we put N in position1: N R A _ _
   Then we have two blanks: positions 4 and 5.
   We need a valid word: e.g., ""NRA_something"". What words? 
   Possibilities: 
     ""NRAIL""? -> not a word? 
     ""NRAIN""? -> but same as crane pattern? no? 
     ""NRAJA"" -> not English?
     ""NRAKE"" -> but E is eliminated? we cannot use E.
   Let's try without E: 
     Perhaps ""NRAIN""? But that uses two N's? But that might be possible.

   Wait, note: the feedback for ""crane"" had N in the word but not in the 4th position. If we place N at position1 then the word must have at least one N. It can have more? But we don't know. 

   Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters unless we have them in the guess? So we have to be cautious.

   Common words? ""BRAIN"" -> but we don't have B as a constraint? no, we don't know about B? But wait, we must avoid C and E.

   Let me brainstorm words with the pattern [letter] R A [letter] [letter], avoiding C and E:

   Some possibilities:
     - ""DRAMA"": D R A M A -> then check: 
         D: not tested before? 
         M: tested in crane? crane had M? no, crane was C R A N E. Only C,R,A,N,E were tested. 
         A is repeated? 
     - ""BRAVA"": B R A V A -> valid? 
     - ""TRAIN"": T R A I N -> has T, I, N? 
     - ""GRAIN"": G R A I N
     - ""DRAIN"": D R A I N -> has D and I? 

   Also, note: N must be in the word? So the word must have one N? But if we choose ""BRAVO"", it doesn't have N? So that would be invalid because we know the secret word has N (from the feedback of crane).

   Therefore, our next word must include the letter N? Yes, because we know N is in the secret word.

   Also, we cannot use C or E.

   So let's look for words that have N and fit the pattern _ R A _ _ and do not contain C or E.

   Possibilities:
     ""BRAIN"" -> B R A I N: 
        Position 1: B (allowed? yes, we don't know about B) 
        Position 4: I
        Position 5: N -> so N is at the end? which is allowed? because we can have N at position 5? since the feedback said N is in the word but not at position 4.

     ""DRAIN"": D R A I N -> same structure.

     ""GRAIN"": G R A I N

     ""TRAIN"": T R A I N

     ""STRAIN""? -> too long? 6 letters? so no, must be 5.

     ""BRAWN"": B R A W N -> has W? 
        Then W is new? 
        But also N at the end? valid.

     ""DRAWN"": D R A W N

   How to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible? We have positions 1,4,5 to figure out. Also, we know the word must have N, so if we don't put N in the word again, we lose the chance to test it? Actually, we must include N? because the word must contain N? 

   But note: we are trying to figure out where the N goes? Since we know it is either in position1 or 5? 

   Option 1: We put N in position1? to test if it is at the beginning? Then we can try a word starting with N and having R A and then two more new letters? But then the word must not have E or C.

   Example: 
     ""NRATS"" -> not a word?
     ""NRAMA"" -> not a word? 
     ""NRAJA"" -> not valid.

   It's hard to find a word starting with N followed by RA? 

   Alternatively, we can put N at the end? 

   Since it's more common to find words ending with N? like ""TRAIN"", ""GRAIN"", etc.

   How about we try ""TRAIN""?

   Let me check: we have T at the beginning? which is new? and I at the fourth position? Also N at the end? 

   Then if the feedback we get:

     If the word is ""TRAIN"":
        T: if it's in the secret word? we don't know? 
        R: ✓ (already known)
        A: ✓ (already known)
        I: ? 
        N: if we get ✓ for N? then that would tell us the secret word ends with N? But wait: the secret word has N? but which position? we had N in the 4th position in crane? now we put N in 5th? 

   Alternatively, we might try a word that has N in the first position? Let me see if such words exist? 

     ""NRAZD""? not a word.
     ""NRAHZ""? no.

   Actually, there are words like ""NRAKS""? not a word. 

   After checking, common words with pattern:
     ""NRA"" at the start: 
        ""NRA? not found.""

   So probably N is at the end? So let's go with a word ending with N? 

   How about ""BRAWN""? It uses W? which is uncommon? 

   Alternatively, let's consider the word ""DRAIN"". It uses D and I? which are common? 

   Another possibility: we can also use letters that are common and not tried before? to catch more possibilities.

   In the first guess, we used: C, R, A, N, E. So letters tested: C, R, A, N, E.

   Now let's avoid reusing C and E? but R and A are fixed? So we have to use R and A in the same positions.

   We are forced to use R and A? 

   We also must use N? because it is present? and we don't know where? 

   Since we are forced to use R and A, and we know the word has N? 

   Let me pick ""TRAIN"": 
        T is new? 
        R, A -> known? 
        I -> new? 
        N -> known present? but in which position? 

   But note: if the secret word has N only at position5? That would be consistent? But what if the secret word has two N's? and one in position1? then putting N at position5 would give us a ✓ for N? and the T and I would give us information.

   However, we don't know? 

   Alternatively, how about we try a word that has N at position5? and uses a common pattern? 

   I think ""TRAIN"" is a good candidate? But let's check if there are other constraints? 

   Also, we must pick a valid English word.

   So let's try ""TRAIN"": 

     Pattern: T R A I N

     We'll get feedback:

        T: ? 
        R: ✓ (we know) -> will be ✓ again? 
        A: ✓ 
        I: ? 
        N: ... here, if the secret word has N at the end? then ✓? but what if the secret word has N only at position1? Then we are putting N at the end? which is not the position? so it would be '-'? meaning it's in the word but wrong position? 

        However, note: the secret word has N somewhere? if not in position4? but if it has N at position1? then our guess having N at position5? would get '-' because the letter N exists but not at position5? Actually, no? if the secret word has N at position1? then when we put N at position5? we should get '-' for N? meaning ""in the word but not at this position"".

        But wait: if we get ✓ for R and A? and then for N we get ✓? that would mean the secret word has N at position5? 

        So the feedback will tell us the position of N? 

        Also, we can test T and I? 

        This is good? 

   However, what if the secret word has two N's? For instance, in position1 and position5? Then we would get ✓ for N? but also for the N at position1? that would be unknown? Actually, our guess ""TRAIN"" has N only at the end? so the feedback would only mark the N at the end? 

   But note: the rules don't do duplicate marking? Actually, let's recall how duplicate letters are handled? 

   Typically, in such games? The feedback marks each letter only if it matches? However, duplicate handling? 

   But in our rules? It says: ""Each letter in your guess"" so each letter? But the example doesn't have duplicates? 

   Since the example doesn't duplicate? let me assume that the feedback marks each occurrence individually? 

   But the rules state: ""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was."" per letter? 

   However, if the secret word has duplicate letters? and your guess has duplicate? the marking is done independently? 

   Example: Secret: APPLE? Guess: PAPER? 
        First P: if it is in the secret? but the secret has two P? 

   But in our case: we have an example? Actually, the rules don't specify duplicates? However, since we are building an AI? we must assume that the feedback will mark for each letter independently, using the following rule:

   How duplicates are handled? 
        Typically:
        The feedback:
            First, mark the exact matches (✓)
            Then, for the remaining letters? mark yellow if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret? but not double-counting.

   Therefore, we have to be cautious? 

   But in our guess ""TRAIN"": 
        If N appears only once in the secret? and we put N at the end? and it's not the position? then it's '-'? 
        If N appears only once at the end? then ✓? 

   Also, if N appears twice? then we might get ✓ at the end? and also mark the other N? but note we didn't put another N? So we only mark the one instance.

   Alternatively, if N is at position1? and we put N at the end? then the feedback for N would be '-' because it exists but not at the end? 

   So either way, we'll learn where N is? 

   Also, we test T and I? 

   Therefore, ""TRAIN"" seems a good word? 

   Another candidate: ""BRAIN"", ""DRAIN"", ""GRAIN"", ""FRAUD""? wait, FRAUD does not have N? so invalid? because we must have N? 

   Or ""PRANK""? but that doesn't have RA fixed? wait, no: we must have the second letter R and third letter A? 

   So ""PRANK"" -> pattern P R A N K? 
        Then position1: P? 
        position2: R? -> ✓? 
        position3: A? -> ✓? 
        position4: N? -> but wait: we already know that N is in the word? but the feedback told us not to put N at position4? because in crane we had N at position4? which got '-'. Then why would we put N again at position4? 

   Actually, we cannot? because the secret word does not have N at position4? so if we put N at position4? then we would get '-' ONLY if there is another N? because it would be in the word but not at position4? what if the secret word has only one N? then putting N at position4? that's the only N? then it would have to be x? because it's not in the word at any other position? but wait? yes? because it is in the word? but in a different position? 

   Actually, no: the feedback says N is present? so it should be '-'? regardless? because it is in the word? just not at the correct position? 

   But: the rules? 
        '-' means ""the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position""

   So if we guess N at position4? and the secret word has N at position1? then we get '-'? 
   If we guess N at position4? and the secret word has only that one N? but it is at position1? then we get '-'? 
   But in our case? we specifically know that N is not at position4? because we already tried crane which had N at position4? and it was marked as in the word but wrong position? so the secret word N is definitely not at position4? 

   But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate N? and one is at position4? and one elsewhere? Then when we guessed crane? the N at position4? could have been marked as '-'? because there is an N at position4? but maybe the feedback rules? Actually, the rules don't say? 

   However, the feedback for crane: N(-) means that N is present? AND at least it is not in the correct position? so that's the same? 

   But if the secret word has two N's? and one at position4? then when we guessed crane? we put an N at position4? and it would be ✓? not '-'? because it is in the correct position? 

   Therefore, since we got '-'? that indicates the N in crane was correct as presence? but not in the position? so the secret word does NOT have an N at position4? at all? 

   So why would we put an N at position4 in the next guess? It would be redundant? and also, we know the secret word does not have N at position4? so if we put N at position4? we would get '-'? meaning it is in the word? but not at position4? which we already know? That gives us no extra information? and wastes an opportunity to test a new letter? 

   Therefore, we should avoid putting N at position4? 

   So in the pattern? for the fourth position? we should not put N? 

   Similarly, for the fifth position? we might put N? 

   Similarly, for the first position? we might put N? 

   So going back: 

   We can choose a word that:

      Option A: N at position1? then the word: N R A [letter4] [letter5]? avoiding E and C? and avoid N at position4? 

         But we don't know? and we must have at least one N? which we have? 

         Words? ""NRAIA""? not a word? 

         ""NRAIS""? not a word? 

         ""NRAHA""? not a word? 

         ""NRAYS"": also not? 

         There don't seem to be common words? 

      Option B: put N at position5? 

         Then we try words like ... R A ? N? 

         Then we have positions4? which cannot be N? and position1? which cannot be E or C? 

         Words: many? ""TRAIN"", ""BRAIN"", ""GRAIN"", ""DRAIN"", ""BRAWN"", etc.

   Since ""TRAIN"" is a common word? and uses T and I? which are new? we can try ""TRAIN"".

   But note: what if the secret word has T? We don't know? So by guessing ""TRAIN""? we test T and I? and learn? 

   Alternatively, if we want to test more vowels? I is a vowel? 

   Also, note we have eliminated E? so if the secret word has an I? that would be good to know? 

   I think ""TRAIN"" is reasonable.

   Another alternative: ""PRANK""? but that breaks the pattern? because we have R and A locked? so it must be second and third? wait, no: ""PRANK"" is P R A N K? so that fits? 

   But ""PRANK"" has P, A (already known), R (known), N (known), and K? 
        Position1: P? 
        Position2: R? ✓
        Position3: A? ✓
        Position4: N? but wait: we just reasoned we shouldn't put N at position4? because we know the secret word doesn't have N there? so it will get '-'? which tells us nothing? 

        Position5: K? 

   But we are now testing fewer new letters? because we test P, K? and reuse N? Also, we know that in this word N is at the fourth position? which we know is wrong? so we'll get '-'? 

   Whereas in ""TRAIN""? we test two new letters: T and I? and put N in a new position? that we are unsure of? 

   So ""TRAIN"" is better? 

   Therefore, we choose ""TRAIN"".

   Let me confirm: 

        The secret word has the form: _ R A _ _ 

        We are guessing: T R A I N

        Feedback possibilities? 

        We know R and A will be ✓.

        For T: if it is in the word? then if at position1? ✓? if elsewhere? '-'? if not? x? 

        For I: same? either ✓, '-', or x? 

        For N: 
            Either ✓? if the secret word has N at position5? 
            Or '-'? if the secret word has N at position1? 
            Or if the secret word has N somewhere else? like position5? ✓? position1? '-'? 

        And note: we know the secret word doesn't have E or C? and we haven't introduced them? 

   Therefore, let's guess ""TRAIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- Letters **C** and **E** are absent (✓ feedback: x), so they are excluded from future guesses.  
- **R** is in the correct position (2nd) and **A** is in the correct position (3rd), so the secret word format is `_ R A _ _`.  
- **N** is present but not in the 4th position (✓ feedback: -), meaning it must be in position 1 or 5.  

For the next guess:  
- I need a valid 5-letter word that fits `_ R A _ _`.  
- The word must include **N** (since it’s confirmed present) but avoid placing it in the 4th position.  
- Exclude **C** and **E**, and prioritize testing new letters to gather more information.  

""TRAIN"" is an optimal choice:  
- Fits the format (`T R A I N`).  
- Places **N** in position 5 (tests the possibility that N ends the word, or if not, verifies it must be in position 1).  
- Introduces **T** (new letter at position 1) and **I** (new letter at position 4) to test their presence/positions.  
- Avoids **C**, **E**, and reuses confirmed **R** and **A** correctly.  

This guess maximizes information about the unknown positions while adhering to constraints.",Guess 2: train -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We don't have any prior feedback, so we need to make the first guess.
 A good first guess usually uses common letters and covers five distinct letters to maximize information.
 Common vowels and consonants are often chosen.

 Some common starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, SALET, etc.

 Considering that:
 - We want to include common letters and have a mix of vowels and consonants.

 Let's choose a word that has two vowels and three consonants, covering frequent letters.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"":
 C - common consonant
 R - common consonant
 A - common vowel
 N - common consonant
 E - common vowel

 Alternatively, ""SALET"" or ""SLATE"" are also good.

 However, note that we are playing in English and the word must be valid.

 Let me pick ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 Guess: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(-) E(x)
 This means:
 - C is not in the secret word (x)
 - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (2nd letter) (✓)
 - A is in the secret word and in the correct position (3rd letter) (✓)
 - N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position (-)
 - E is not in the secret word (x)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the form: _ R A _ _ 
   because R is in position 2 and A in position 3.

 - The letters C and E are not in the word at all.

 - The letter N is in the word but not in the 4th position. So it must be in position 1 or 5? 
   But note: the word is 5 letters and we have positions 1,4,5 unknown. However, since N is present but not in position 4, it must be in either position 1 or 5.

 Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] R A [letter4] [letter5]
 where:
   letter1 can be any letter except C and E (and any other letters we know are absent? so far only C and E are ruled out), but it might be N? 
   letter4 cannot be N (because feedback says N is in the word but not in position 4), and also cannot be C or E. 
   letter5 cannot be C or E, but if N is in the word and not in the 4th, then N must be in position 1 or 5.

 So possibilities for letter1: It could be N? Or another letter? But note that N is present somewhere. Since it's not in position 4, and position 2 and 3 are fixed, it must be in 1 or 5.

 Now, we need to form a new 5-letter word that:
 - Has R in the 2nd position and A in the 3rd position (because we have ✓ for both and they must be kept)
 - Does not contain C or E (because both ruled out by x)
 - Contains N (because we got - for N meaning it's in the word) but not in the 4th position.

 So the new word should be of the form: [N or other] R A [not N] [if not N in 1 then must be N in 5]

 But wait: we also want to test for other letters to figure out the missing ones.

 Strategy: We know the word has R in position 2, A in position 3, and an N that is either in position 1 or 5.

 We also have two other letters to find: letter4 and either letter1 (if N is in 5) or letter5 (if N is in 1).

 We should try to guess a word that:
 - Uses common letters to maximize information
 - And fits the constraints.

 Since the word must have R and A fixed, and N must be present but not in position 4, we can try two cases.

 However, note that we don't have to fix N yet because we can test both possibilities with a word that has N among the possibilities? 

 Let me think of common words that fit the pattern:

 Pattern: _ R A _ _

 We know the first letter can be a letter that is not C or E, and the fourth and fifth similarly without C and E. Also, we know one of position1 or position5 must be N? But not necessarily: wait, N is somewhere else. Actually, N could also be in position 5? Yes, because the 5th position is unknown.

 Let me list possible letters for each position:
 - Position1: all letters except C, E -> but note that we have an N to place? Actually, the N could be in position 5? So position1 cannot be E or C, but might be anything else including N? However, if N is not in position1, then it must be in position5.

 How about we try to guess a word that has N in either position1 or position5? And then use other common letters for the remaining.

 Example words:
 - If we put N in position1: N R A _ _
   Then we have two blanks: positions 4 and 5.
   We need a valid word: e.g., ""NRA_something"". What words? 
   Possibilities: 
     ""NRAIL""? -> not a word? 
     ""NRAIN""? -> but same as crane pattern? no? 
     ""NRAJA"" -> not English?
     ""NRAKE"" -> but E is eliminated? we cannot use E.
   Let's try without E: 
     Perhaps ""NRAIN""? But that uses two N's? But that might be possible.

   Wait, note: the feedback for ""crane"" had N in the word but not in the 4th position. If we place N at position1 then the word must have at least one N. It can have more? But we don't know. 

   Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters unless we have them in the guess? So we have to be cautious.

   Common words? ""BRAIN"" -> but we don't have B as a constraint? no, we don't know about B? But wait, we must avoid C and E.

   Let me brainstorm words with the pattern [letter] R A [letter] [letter], avoiding C and E:

   Some possibilities:
     - ""DRAMA"": D R A M A -> then check: 
         D: not tested before? 
         M: tested in crane? crane had M? no, crane was C R A N E. Only C,R,A,N,E were tested. 
         A is repeated? 
     - ""BRAVA"": B R A V A -> valid? 
     - ""TRAIN"": T R A I N -> has T, I, N? 
     - ""GRAIN"": G R A I N
     - ""DRAIN"": D R A I N -> has D and I? 

   Also, note: N must be in the word? So the word must have one N? But if we choose ""BRAVO"", it doesn't have N? So that would be invalid because we know the secret word has N (from the feedback of crane).

   Therefore, our next word must include the letter N? Yes, because we know N is in the secret word.

   Also, we cannot use C or E.

   So let's look for words that have N and fit the pattern _ R A _ _ and do not contain C or E.

   Possibilities:
     ""BRAIN"" -> B R A I N: 
        Position 1: B (allowed? yes, we don't know about B) 
        Position 4: I
        Position 5: N -> so N is at the end? which is allowed? because we can have N at position 5? since the feedback said N is in the word but not at position 4.

     ""DRAIN"": D R A I N -> same structure.

     ""GRAIN"": G R A I N

     ""TRAIN"": T R A I N

     ""STRAIN""? -> too long? 6 letters? so no, must be 5.

     ""BRAWN"": B R A W N -> has W? 
        Then W is new? 
        But also N at the end? valid.

     ""DRAWN"": D R A W N

   How to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible? We have positions 1,4,5 to figure out. Also, we know the word must have N, so if we don't put N in the word again, we lose the chance to test it? Actually, we must include N? because the word must contain N? 

   But note: we are trying to figure out where the N goes? Since we know it is either in position1 or 5? 

   Option 1: We put N in position1? to test if it is at the beginning? Then we can try a word starting with N and having R A and then two more new letters? But then the word must not have E or C.

   Example: 
     ""NRATS"" -> not a word?
     ""NRAMA"" -> not a word? 
     ""NRAJA"" -> not valid.

   It's hard to find a word starting with N followed by RA? 

   Alternatively, we can put N at the end? 

   Since it's more common to find words ending with N? like ""TRAIN"", ""GRAIN"", etc.

   How about we try ""TRAIN""?

   Let me check: we have T at the beginning? which is new? and I at the fourth position? Also N at the end? 

   Then if the feedback we get:

     If the word is ""TRAIN"":
        T: if it's in the secret word? we don't know? 
        R: ✓ (already known)
        A: ✓ (already known)
        I: ? 
        N: if we get ✓ for N? then that would tell us the secret word ends with N? But wait: the secret word has N? but which position? we had N in the 4th position in crane? now we put N in 5th? 

   Alternatively, we might try a word that has N in the first position? Let me see if such words exist? 

     ""NRAZD""? not a word.
     ""NRAHZ""? no.

   Actually, there are words like ""NRAKS""? not a word. 

   After checking, common words with pattern:
     ""NRA"" at the start: 
        ""NRA? not found.""

   So probably N is at the end? So let's go with a word ending with N? 

   How about ""BRAWN""? It uses W? which is uncommon? 

   Alternatively, let's consider the word ""DRAIN"". It uses D and I? which are common? 

   Another possibility: we can also use letters that are common and not tried before? to catch more possibilities.

   In the first guess, we used: C, R, A, N, E. So letters tested: C, R, A, N, E.

   Now let's avoid reusing C and E? but R and A are fixed? So we have to use R and A in the same positions.

   We are forced to use R and A? 

   We also must use N? because it is present? and we don't know where? 

   Since we are forced to use R and A, and we know the word has N? 

   Let me pick ""TRAIN"": 
        T is new? 
        R, A -> known? 
        I -> new? 
        N -> known present? but in which position? 

   But note: if the secret word has N only at position5? That would be consistent? But what if the secret word has two N's? and one in position1? then putting N at position5 would give us a ✓ for N? and the T and I would give us information.

   However, we don't know? 

   Alternatively, how about we try a word that has N at position5? and uses a common pattern? 

   I think ""TRAIN"" is a good candidate? But let's check if there are other constraints? 

   Also, we must pick a valid English word.

   So let's try ""TRAIN"": 

     Pattern: T R A I N

     We'll get feedback:

        T: ? 
        R: ✓ (we know) -> will be ✓ again? 
        A: ✓ 
        I: ? 
        N: ... here, if the secret word has N at the end? then ✓? but what if the secret word has N only at position1? Then we are putting N at the end? which is not the position? so it would be '-'? meaning it's in the word but wrong position? 

        However, note: the secret word has N somewhere? if not in position4? but if it has N at position1? then our guess having N at position5? would get '-' because the letter N exists but not at position5? Actually, no? if the secret word has N at position1? then when we put N at position5? we should get '-' for N? meaning ""in the word but not at this position"".

        But wait: if we get ✓ for R and A? and then for N we get ✓? that would mean the secret word has N at position5? 

        So the feedback will tell us the position of N? 

        Also, we can test T and I? 

        This is good? 

   However, what if the secret word has two N's? For instance, in position1 and position5? Then we would get ✓ for N? but also for the N at position1? that would be unknown? Actually, our guess ""TRAIN"" has N only at the end? so the feedback would only mark the N at the end? 

   But note: the rules don't do duplicate marking? Actually, let's recall how duplicate letters are handled? 

   Typically, in such games? The feedback marks each letter only if it matches? However, duplicate handling? 

   But in our rules? It says: ""Each letter in your guess"" so each letter? But the example doesn't have duplicates? 

   Since the example doesn't duplicate? let me assume that the feedback marks each occurrence individually? 

   But the rules state: ""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was."" per letter? 

   However, if the secret word has duplicate letters? and your guess has duplicate? the marking is done independently? 

   Example: Secret: APPLE? Guess: PAPER? 
        First P: if it is in the secret? but the secret has two P? 

   But in our case: we have an example? Actually, the rules don't specify duplicates? However, since we are building an AI? we must assume that the feedback will mark for each letter independently, using the following rule:

   How duplicates are handled? 
        Typically:
        The feedback:
            First, mark the exact matches (✓)
            Then, for the remaining letters? mark yellow if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret? but not double-counting.

   Therefore, we have to be cautious? 

   But in our guess ""TRAIN"": 
        If N appears only once in the secret? and we put N at the end? and it's not the position? then it's '-'? 
        If N appears only once at the end? then ✓? 

   Also, if N appears twice? then we might get ✓ at the end? and also mark the other N? but note we didn't put another N? So we only mark the one instance.

   Alternatively, if N is at position1? and we put N at the end? then the feedback for N would be '-' because it exists but not at the end? 

   So either way, we'll learn where N is? 

   Also, we test T and I? 

   Therefore, ""TRAIN"" seems a good word? 

   Another candidate: ""BRAIN"", ""DRAIN"", ""GRAIN"", ""FRAUD""? wait, FRAUD does not have N? so invalid? because we must have N? 

   Or ""PRANK""? but that doesn't have RA fixed? wait, no: we must have the second letter R and third letter A? 

   So ""PRANK"" -> pattern P R A N K? 
        Then position1: P? 
        position2: R? -> ✓? 
        position3: A? -> ✓? 
        position4: N? -> but wait: we already know that N is in the word? but the feedback told us not to put N at position4? because in crane we had N at position4? which got '-'. Then why would we put N again at position4? 

   Actually, we cannot? because the secret word does not have N at position4? so if we put N at position4? then we would get '-' ONLY if there is another N? because it would be in the word but not at position4? what if the secret word has only one N? then putting N at position4? that's the only N? then it would have to be x? because it's not in the word at any other position? but wait? yes? because it is in the word? but in a different position? 

   Actually, no: the feedback says N is present? so it should be '-'? regardless? because it is in the word? just not at the correct position? 

   But: the rules? 
        '-' means ""the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position""

   So if we guess N at position4? and the secret word has N at position1? then we get '-'? 
   If we guess N at position4? and the secret word has only that one N? but it is at position1? then we get '-'? 
   But in our case? we specifically know that N is not at position4? because we already tried crane which had N at position4? and it was marked as in the word but wrong position? so the secret word N is definitely not at position4? 

   But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate N? and one is at position4? and one elsewhere? Then when we guessed crane? the N at position4? could have been marked as '-'? because there is an N at position4? but maybe the feedback rules? Actually, the rules don't say? 

   However, the feedback for crane: N(-) means that N is present? AND at least it is not in the correct position? so that's the same? 

   But if the secret word has two N's? and one at position4? then when we guessed crane? we put an N at position4? and it would be ✓? not '-'? because it is in the correct position? 

   Therefore, since we got '-'? that indicates the N in crane was correct as presence? but not in the position? so the secret word does NOT have an N at position4? at all? 

   So why would we put an N at position4 in the next guess? It would be redundant? and also, we know the secret word does not have N at position4? so if we put N at position4? we would get '-'? meaning it is in the word? but not at position4? which we already know? That gives us no extra information? and wastes an opportunity to test a new letter? 

   Therefore, we should avoid putting N at position4? 

   So in the pattern? for the fourth position? we should not put N? 

   Similarly, for the fifth position? we might put N? 

   Similarly, for the first position? we might put N? 

   So going back: 

   We can choose a word that:

      Option A: N at position1? then the word: N R A [letter4] [letter5]? avoiding E and C? and avoid N at position4? 

         But we don't know? and we must have at least one N? which we have? 

         Words? ""NRAIA""? not a word? 

         ""NRAIS""? not a word? 

         ""NRAHA""? not a word? 

         ""NRAYS"": also not? 

         There don't seem to be common words? 

      Option B: put N at position5? 

         Then we try words like ... R A ? N? 

         Then we have positions4? which cannot be N? and position1? which cannot be E or C? 

         Words: many? ""TRAIN"", ""BRAIN"", ""GRAIN"", ""DRAIN"", ""BRAWN"", etc.

   Since ""TRAIN"" is a common word? and uses T and I? which are new? we can try ""TRAIN"".

   But note: what if the secret word has T? We don't know? So by guessing ""TRAIN""? we test T and I? and learn? 

   Alternatively, if we want to test more vowels? I is a vowel? 

   Also, note we have eliminated E? so if the secret word has an I? that would be good to know? 

   I think ""TRAIN"" is reasonable.

   Another alternative: ""PRANK""? but that breaks the pattern? because we have R and A locked? so it must be second and third? wait, no: ""PRANK"" is P R A N K? so that fits? 

   But ""PRANK"" has P, A (already known), R (known), N (known), and K? 
        Position1: P? 
        Position2: R? ✓
        Position3: A? ✓
        Position4: N? but wait: we just reasoned we shouldn't put N at position4? because we know the secret word doesn't have N there? so it will get '-'? which tells us nothing? 

        Position5: K? 

   But we are now testing fewer new letters? because we test P, K? and reuse N? Also, we know that in this word N is at the fourth position? which we know is wrong? so we'll get '-'? 

   Whereas in ""TRAIN""? we test two new letters: T and I? and put N in a new position? that we are unsure of? 

   So ""TRAIN"" is better? 

   Therefore, we choose ""TRAIN"".

   Let me confirm: 

        The secret word has the form: _ R A _ _ 

        We are guessing: T R A I N

        Feedback possibilities? 

        We know R and A will be ✓.

        For T: if it is in the word? then if at position1? ✓? if elsewhere? '-'? if not? x? 

        For I: same? either ✓, '-', or x? 

        For N: 
            Either ✓? if the secret word has N at position5? 
            Or '-'? if the secret word has N at position1? 
            Or if the secret word has N somewhere else? like position5? ✓? position1? '-'? 

        And note: we know the secret word doesn't have E or C? and we haven't introduced them? 

   Therefore, let's guess ""TRAIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- Letters **C** and **E** are absent (✓ feedback: x), so they are excluded from future guesses.  
- **R** is in the correct position (2nd) and **A** is in the correct position (3rd), so the secret word format is `_ R A _ _`.  
- **N** is present but not in the 4th position (✓ feedback: -), meaning it must be in position 1 or 5.  

For the next guess:  
- I need a valid 5-letter word that fits `_ R A _ _`.  
- The word must include **N** (since it’s confirmed present) but avoid placing it in the 4th position.  
- Exclude **C** and **E**, and prioritize testing new letters to gather more information.  

""TRAIN"" is an optimal choice:  
- Fits the format (`T R A I N`).  
- Places **N** in position 5 (tests the possibility that N ends the word, or if not, verifies it must be in position 1).  
- Introduces **T** (new letter at position 1) and **I** (new letter at position 4) to test their presence/positions.  
- Avoids **C**, **E**, and reuses confirmed **R** and **A** correctly.  

This guess maximizes information about the unknown positions while adhering to constraints.

Yes, because we know N is in the secret word.\n\n   Also, we cannot use C or E.\n\n   So let\'s look for words that have N and fit the pattern _ R A _ _ and do not contain C or E.\n\n   Possibilities:\n     ""BRAIN"" -> B R A I N: \n        Position 1: B (allowed? yes, we don\'t know about B) \n        Position 4: I\n        Position 5: N -> so N is at the end? which is allowed? because we can have N at position 5? since the feedback said N is in the word but not at position 4.\n\n     ""DRAIN"": D R A I N -> same structure.\n\n     ""GRAIN"": G R A I N\n\n     ""TRAIN"": T R A I N\n\n     ""STRAIN""? -> too long? 6 letters? so no, must be 5.\n\n     ""BRAWN"": B R A W N -> has W? \n        Then W is new? \n        But also N at the end? valid.\n\n     ""DRAWN"": D R A W N\n\n   How to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible? We have positions 1,4,5 to figure out. Also, we know the word must have N, so if we don\'t put N in the word again, we lose the chance to test it? Actually, we must include N? because the word must contain N? \n\n   But note: we are trying to figure out where the N goes? Since we know it is either in position1 or 5? \n\n   Option 1: We put N in position1? to test if it is at the beginning? Then we can try a word starting with N and having R A and then two more new letters? But then the word must not have E or C.\n\n   Example: \n     ""NRATS"" -> not a word?\n     ""NRAMA"" -> not a word? \n     ""NRAJA"" -> not valid.\n\n   It\'s hard to find a word starting with N followed by RA? \n\n   Alternatively, we can put N at the end? \n\n   Since it\'s more common to find words ending with N? like ""TRAIN"", ""GRAIN"", etc.\n\n   How about we try ""TRAIN""?\n\n   Let me check: we have T at the beginning? which is new? and I at the fourth position? Also N at the end? \n\n   Then if the feedback we get:\n\n     If the word is ""TRAIN"":\n        T: if it\'s in the secret word? we don\'t know? \n        R: ✓ (already known)\n        A: ✓ (already known)\n        I: ? \n        N: if we get ✓ for N? then that would tell us the secret word ends with N? But wait: the secret word has N? but which position? we had N in the 4th position in crane? now we put N in 5th? \n\n   Alternatively, we might try a word that has N in the first position? Let me see if such words exist? \n\n     ""NRAZD""? not a word.\n     ""NRAHZ""? no.\n\n   Actually, there are words like ""NRAKS""? not a word. \n\n   After checking, common words with pattern:\n     ""NRA"" at the start: \n        ""NRA? not found.""\n\n   So probably N is at the end? So let\'s go with a word ending with N? \n\n   How about ""BRAWN""? It uses W? which is uncommon? \n\n   Alternatively, let\'s consider the word ""DRAIN"". It uses D and I? which are common? \n\n   Another possibility: we can also use letters that are common and not tried before? to catch more possibilities.\n\n   In the first guess, we used: C, R, A, N, E. So letters tested: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n   Now let\'s avoid reusing C and E? but R and A are fixed? So we have to use R and A in the same positions.\n\n   We are forced to use R and A? \n\n   We also must use N? because it is present? and we don\'t know where? \n\n   Since we are forced to use R and A, and we know the word has N? \n\n   Let me pick ""TRAIN"": \n        T is new? \n        R, A -> known? \n        I -> new? \n        N -> known present? but in which position? \n\n   But note: if the secret word has N only at position5? That would be consistent? But what if the secret word has two N\'s? and one in position1? then putting N at position5 would give us a ✓ for N? and the T and I would give us information.\n\n   However, we don\'t know? \n\n   Alternatively, how about we try a word that has N at position5? and uses a common pattern? \n\n   I think ""TRAIN"" is a good candidate? But let\'s check if there are other constraints? \n\n   Also, we must pick a valid English word.\n\n   So let\'s try ""TRAIN"": \n\n     Pattern: T R A I N\n\n     We\'ll get feedback:\n\n        T: ? \n        R: ✓ (we know) -> will be ✓ again? \n        A: ✓ \n        I: ? \n        N: ... here, if the secret word has N at the end? then ✓? but what if the secret word has N only at position1? Then we are putting N at the end? which is not the position? so it would be \'-\'? meaning it\'s in the word but wrong position? \n\n        However, note: the secret word has N somewhere? if not in position4? but if it has N at position1? then our guess having N at position5? would get \'-\' because the letter N exists but not at position5? Actually, no? if the secret word has N at position1? then when we put N at position5? we should get \'-\' for N? meaning ""in the word but not at this position"".\n\n        But wait: if we get ✓ for R and A? and then for N we get ✓? that would mean the secret word has N at position5? \n\n        So the feedback will tell us the position of N? \n\n        Also, we can test T and I? \n\n        This is good? \n\n   However, what if the secret word has two N\'s? For instance, in position1 and position5? Then we would get ✓ for N? but also for the N at position1? that would be unknown? Actually, our guess ""TRAIN"" has N only at the end? so the feedback would only mark the N at the end? \n\n   But note: the rules don\'t do duplicate marking? Actually, let\'s recall how duplicate letters are handled? \n\n   Typically, in such games? The feedback marks each letter only if it matches? However, duplicate handling? \n\n   But in our rules? It says: ""Each letter in your guess"" so each letter? But the example doesn\'t have duplicates? \n\n   Since the example doesn\'t duplicate? let me assume that the feedback marks each occurrence individually? \n\n   But the rules state: ""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was."" per letter? \n\n   However, if the secret word has duplicate letters? and your guess has duplicate? the marking is done independently? \n\n   Example: Secret: APPLE? Guess: PAPER? \n        First P: if it is in the secret? but the secret has two P? \n\n   But in our case: we have an example? Actually, the rules don\'t specify duplicates? However, since we are building an AI? we must assume that the feedback will mark for each letter independently, using the following rule:\n\n   How duplicates are handled? \n        Typically:\n        The feedback:\n            First, mark the exact matches (✓)\n            Then, for the remaining letters? mark yellow if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret? but not double-counting.\n\n   Therefore, we have to be cautious? \n\n   But in our guess ""TRAIN"": \n        If N appears only once in the secret? and we put N at the end? and it\'s not the position? then it\'s \'-\'? \n        If N appears only once at the end? then ✓? \n\n   Also, if N appears twice? then we might get ✓ at the end? and also mark the other N? but note we didn\'t put another N? So we only mark the one instance.\n\n   Alternatively, if N is at position1? and we put N at the end? then the feedback for N would be \'-\' because it exists but not at the end? \n\n   So either way, we\'ll learn where N is? \n\n   Also, we test T and I? \n\n   Therefore, ""TRAIN"" seems a good word? \n\n   Another candidate: ""BRAIN"", ""DRAIN"", ""GRAIN"", ""FRAUD""? wait, FRAUD does not have N? so invalid? because we must have N? \n\n   Or ""PRANK""? but that doesn\'t have RA fixed? wait, no: we must have the second letter R and third letter A? \n\n   So ""PRANK"" -> pattern P R A N K? \n        Then position1: P? \n        position2: R? -> ✓? \n        position3: A? -> ✓? \n        position4: N? -> but wait: we already know that N is in the word? but the feedback told us not to put N at position4? because in crane we had N at position4? which got \'-\'. Then why would we put N again at position4? \n\n   Actually, we cannot? because the secret word does not have N at position4? so if we put N at position4? then we would get \'-\' ONLY if there is another N? because it would be in the word but not at position4? what if the secret word has only one N? then putting N at position4? that\'s the only N? then it would have to be x? because it\'s not in the word at any other position? but wait? yes? because it is in the word? but in a different position? \n\n   Actually, no: the feedback says N is present? so it should be \'-\'? regardless? because it is in the word? just not at the correct position? \n\n   But: the rules? \n        \'-\' means ""the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position""\n\n   So if we guess N at position4? and the secret word has N at position1? then we get \'-\'? \n   If we guess N at position4? and the secret word has only that one N? but it is at position1? then we get \'-\'? \n   But in our case? we specifically know that N is not at position4? because we already tried crane which had N at position4? and it was marked as in the word but wrong position? so the secret word N is definitely not at position4? \n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate N? and one is at position4? and one elsewhere? Then when we guessed crane? the N at position4? could have been marked as \'-\'? because there is an N at position4? but maybe the feedback rules? Actually, the rules don\'t say? \n\n   However, the feedback for crane: N(-) means that N is present? AND at least it is not in the correct position? so that\'s the same? \n\n   But if the secret word has two N\'s? and one at position4? then when we guessed crane? we put an N at position4? and it would be ✓? not \'-\'? because it is in the correct position? \n\n   Therefore, since we got \'-\'? that indicates the N in crane was correct as presence? but not in the position? so the secret word does NOT have an N at position4? at all? \n\n   So why would we put an N at position4 in the next guess? It would be redundant? and also, we know the secret word does not have N at position4? so if we put N at position4? we would get \'-\'? meaning it is in the word? but not at position4? which we already know? That gives us no extra information? and wastes an opportunity to test a new letter? \n\n   Therefore, we should avoid putting N at position4? \n\n   So in the pattern? for the fourth position? we should not put N? \n\n   Similarly, for the fifth position? we might put N? \n\n   Similarly, for the first position? we might put N? \n\n   So going back: \n\n   We can choose a word that:\n\n      Option A: N at position1? then the word: N R A [letter4] [letter5]? avoiding E and C? and avoid N at position4? \n\n         But we don\'t know? and we must have at least one N? which we have? \n\n         Words? ""NRAIA""? not a word? \n\n         ""NRAIS""? not a word? \n\n         ""NRAHA""? not a word? \n\n         ""NRAYS"": also not? \n\n         There don\'t seem to be common words? \n\n      Option B: put N at position5? \n\n         Then we try words like ... R A ? N? \n\n         Then we have positions4? which cannot be N? and position1? which cannot be E or C? \n\n         Words: many? ""TRAIN"", ""BRAIN"", ""GRAIN"", ""DRAIN"", ""BRAWN"", etc.\n\n   Since ""TRAIN"" is a common word? and uses T and I? which are new? we can try ""TRAIN"".\n\n   But note: what if the secret word has T? We don\'t know? So by guessing ""TRAIN""? we test T and I? and learn? \n\n   Alternatively, if we want to test more vowels? I is a vowel? \n\n   Also, note we have eliminated E? so if the secret word has an I? that would be good to know? \n\n   I think ""TRAIN"" is reasonable.\n\n   Another alternative: ""PRANK""? but that breaks the pattern? because we have R and A locked? so it must be second and third? wait, no: ""PRANK"" is P R A N K? so that fits? \n\n   But ""PRANK"" has P, A (already known), R (known), N (known), and K? \n        Position1: P? \n        Position2: R? ✓\n        Position3: A? ✓\n        Position4: N? but wait: we just reasoned we shouldn\'t put N at position4? because we know the secret word doesn\'t have N there? so it will get \'-\'? which tells us nothing? \n\n        Position5: K? \n\n   But we are now testing fewer new letters? because we test P, K? and reuse N? Also, we know that in this word N is at the fourth position? which we know is wrong? so we\'ll get \'-\'? \n\n   Whereas in ""TRAIN""? we test two new letters: T and I? and put N in a new position? that we are unsure of? \n\n   So ""TRAIN"" is better? \n\n   Therefore, we choose ""TRAIN"".\n\n   Let me confirm: \n\n        The secret word has the form: _ R A _ _ \n\n        We are guessing: T R A I N\n\n        Feedback possibilities? \n\n        We know R and A will be ✓.\n\n        For T: if it is in the word? then if at position1? ✓? if elsewhere? \'-\'? if not? x? \n\n        For I: same? either ✓, \'-\', or x? \n\n        For N: \n            Either ✓? if the secret word has N at position5? \n            Or \'-\'? if the secret word has N at position1? \n            Or if the secret word has N somewhere else? like position5? ✓? position1? \'-\'? \n\n        And note: we know the secret word doesn\'t have E or C? and we haven\'t introduced them? \n\n   Therefore, let\'s guess ""TRAIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- Letters **C** and **E** are absent (✓ feedback: x), so they are excluded from future guesses.  \n- **R** is in the correct position (2nd) and **A** is in the correct position (3rd), so the secret word format is `_ R A _ _`.  \n- **N** is present but not in the 4th position (✓ feedback: -), meaning it must be in position 1 or 5.  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- I need a valid 5-letter word that fits `_ R A _ _`.  \n- The word must include **N** (since it’s confirmed present) but avoid placing it in the 4th position.  \n- Exclude **C** and **E**, and prioritize testing new letters to gather more information.  \n\n""TRAIN"" is an optimal choice:  \n- Fits the format (`T R A I N`).  \n- Places **N** in position 5 (tests the possibility that N ends the word, or if not, verifies it must be in position 1).  \n- Introduces **T** (new letter at position 1) and **I** (new letter at position 4) to test their presence/positions.  \n- Avoids **C**, **E**, and reuses confirmed **R** and **A** correctly.  \n\nThis guess maximizes information about the unknown positions while adhering to constraints.\n\n<guess>train</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: train -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:
Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(-), E(x)
Guess 2: train -> T(x), R(✓), A(✓), I(✓), N(✓)

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C and E are absent (x) → they can be excluded.
- R is in position 2 (✓), A is in position 3 (✓) → we know the word has **R** in 2nd and **A** in 3rd, so the pattern is _ R A _ _.
- N is present but not in position 4 (-) → so N must be in position 1 or 5? But now look at the second guess.

From Guess 2 (""train""):
- T is absent (x) → T can be excluded.
- R, A are confirmed (✓) as expected.
- I is in the correct position at position 4 (✓) → so the 4th letter is **I**.
- N is in the correct position at position 5 (✓) → so the 5th letter is **N**.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 2: **R** (from both)
- Position 3: **A** (from both)
- Position 4: **I** (from ""train"")
- Position 5: **N** (from ""train"")

So the word is _ R A I N. Only position 1 is missing.

Constraints from absent letters:
- Exclude C (from crane), E (from crane), T (from train).

So we need to find the first letter: it must be a letter that:
- Is not C, E, or T.
- Forms a valid English word ending with ""RAIN"".

What are some possibilities? Consider words ending in ""RAIN"":
- BRAIN
- DRAIN
- FRAIN? (not a word)
- GRAIN
- PRAIN? (not a word)
- TRAIN? but T is excluded from Guess 2.

So valid options: BRAIN, DRAIN, GRAIN, etc.

Now, note that we need to confirm the first letter. In the first guess, we had ""N"" in crane, and we know N is in the word but not at position 4? But in this case, N is at position 5? which fits? That was already confirmed.

Also, in the first guess, there was an N? and we see the word has N at position 5? so the '-' in the first guess was because the N was moved from position 4? Now we have I at position 4? so that explains.

We need to guess the word? But note: we have the pattern _ R A I N? And we know from the second guess that I and N are fixed? And the word must be valid? So the only unknown is the first letter? And we have to choose.

But note: in the game? we are supposed to guess the exact word? So we can guess ""BRAIN"", ""DRAIN"", or ""GRAIN"", etc.

But wait: we are allowed 6 tries? and we are on guess 3? We can try to guess one now? But to maximize information? However, we only have one blank? and we can test that? So we should choose a word that might be the actual word? and test it? But we don't have to worry about information because there's only one letter to test? 

Let me list possible words ending in ""RAIN"":
- BRAIN
- DRAIN
- FRAIN? (not valid)
- GRAIN
- URAIN? (not valid)
- PRAIN? (not valid)
- TRAIN? not possible? because T is excluded? by train's feedback? T(x) so absent.

So possible: BRAIN, DRAIN, GRAIN? and others that are valid? Check:
- ""DRAIN"" and ""GRAIN"" are both valid? ""BRAIN"" as well.

Also, note: ""CRAIN""? C is excluded? so no? and E doesn't appear? 

Moreover, letters we have tested: 
- Absent: C, E, T.
- Present: R, A, N, I (with positions fixed).

Since there's only one position? we don't need to test multiple? We can just pick one? It doesn't matter? because if we guess and it's wrong? we get feedback? then we can guess again? 

But we know the word must be something? And if we list the possibilities? There are many? Let's consider:

Common words: BRAIN, DRAIN, GRAIN? and FRAIN? no? but also ""URAIN"" no? ""PRAIN"" no? 

Also, ""KRAIN""? not a word? 

So let's get a list of valid -RAIN words:

Typical: BRAIN, DRAIN, GRAIN? 

Less common? ""TRAIN"" is excluded? 

So we can guess one of them? For example: BRAIN? 

But note: if we are wrong? we still have tries? 

Also, we haven't tested B, D, G? But we don't need to test letters? because we are guessing a word? 

Given that the pattern is fixed? and we have one letter? We could guess ""BRAIN"" as a common word.

But let's see if there are more than 3 possibilities? 

Another: ""FLAIN""? not valid? ""SRAIN""? not valid? ""WRAIN""? not valid? 

So the most common: BRAIN, DRAIN, GRAIN? 

We have 3? and 4 tries left? so we can guess one? 

Perhaps we can guess ""BRAIN"": 

But note: we don't know anything about B? 

Alternatively? We could guess a word that uses other letters? but we only need to test the first letter? So guessing BRAIN would test if the first letter is B? 

Similarly? we can do any word matching _RAIN? 

We must choose a valid word? 

I think the best is to guess one? Let's pick ""BRAIN"" because it starts with B? a common consonant? 

So the guess: BRAIN

Now? let's write the feedback we expect? 

If BRAIN is the secret? then all ✓? 

If not? then we get feedback: B might be ✓? or if not? then it might be absent? or in the word? 

But since we don't have other positions? only position1 matters? 

So: 
- B: if the word is BRAIN? ✓? 
- if the word is DRAIN? then B is absent? so x? 
- etc? 

Similarly? R,A,I,N are fixed? so ✓? ✓? ✓? ✓? 

Therefore? the feedback will tell us if B is in the word? Specifically? the first letter? 

Then if not? we try another? 

But we cannot? because position 2-5 are fixed? so any word we guess must have R A I N in those positions? 

So only position1 varies? 

Therefore? after BRAIN? if wrong? we can then try DRAIN? and so on? 

But we have limited tries? 

We are on guess 3? then we have 4,5,6 left? and 3 possibilities? so plenty? 

We can guess BRAIN now? 

But just to be systematic? and perhaps try the most probable? in English? ""BRAIN"" is common? 

However? we have no information? 

But perhaps we could have chosen a word that uses more untested letters? but we cannot? because the entire word except position1 is fixed? 

So we must guess a word that ends with RAIN? with a first letter not C, E, T? 

Therefore? guess BRAIN? 

Alternatively? note that we don't know B? So this guess will reveal? 

So let's go with BRAIN?
</think>
Based on the cumulative feedback:

### Deductions:
- **From Guess 1 (crane):**
  - **C** and **E** are absent (✗); exclude them.
  - **R** is in position 2 (✓).
  - **A** is in position 3 (✓).
  - **N** is present but not in position 4 (-), so it must be in position 1 or 5.
- **From Guess 2 (train):**
  - **T** is absent (✗); exclude it.
  - **R** (position 2, ✓) and **A** (position 3, ✓) confirmed.
  - **I** is in position 4 (✓).
  - **N** is in position 5 (✓).

### Knowledge:
- Secret word format: `_ R A I N`  
  - Positions 2–5 are fixed: **R**, **A**, **I**, **N**.
  - Only position 1 is unknown.
- Excluded letters: **C**, **E**, **T**.
- Possible candidates for position 1: Any English letter except C/E/T, forming a valid word (e.g., BRAIN, DRAIN, GRAIN).

### Next Guess Strategy:
- Position 1 must be a new letter (not C/E/T) to complete the word.
- Since BRAIN is common and tests **B**, it’s a strong candidate:
  - If BRAIN is correct, we solve the puzzle.
  - If incorrect, feedback on **B** eliminates one option, narrowing to other candidates (e.g., DRAIN, GRAIN).

<guess>brain</guess>",brain,"We have feedback from two guesses:
Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(-), E(x)
Guess 2: train -> T(x), R(✓), A(✓), I(✓), N(✓)

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C and E are absent (x) → they can be excluded.
- R is in position 2 (✓), A is in position 3 (✓) → we know the word has **R** in 2nd and **A** in 3rd, so the pattern is _ R A _ _.
- N is present but not in position 4 (-) → so N must be in position 1 or 5? But now look at the second guess.

From Guess 2 (""train""):
- T is absent (x) → T can be excluded.
- R, A are confirmed (✓) as expected.
- I is in the correct position at position 4 (✓) → so the 4th letter is **I**.
- N is in the correct position at position 5 (✓) → so the 5th letter is **N**.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 2: **R** (from both)
- Position 3: **A** (from both)
- Position 4: **I** (from ""train"")
- Position 5: **N** (from ""train"")

So the word is _ R A I N. Only position 1 is missing.

Constraints from absent letters:
- Exclude C (from crane), E (from crane), T (from train).

So we need to find the first letter: it must be a letter that:
- Is not C, E, or T.
- Forms a valid English word ending with ""RAIN"".

What are some possibilities? Consider words ending in ""RAIN"":
- BRAIN
- DRAIN
- FRAIN? (not a word)
- GRAIN
- PRAIN? (not a word)
- TRAIN? but T is excluded from Guess 2.

So valid options: BRAIN, DRAIN, GRAIN, etc.

Now, note that we need to confirm the first letter. In the first guess, we had ""N"" in crane, and we know N is in the word but not at position 4? But in this case, N is at position 5? which fits? That was already confirmed.

Also, in the first guess, there was an N? and we see the word has N at position 5? so the '-' in the first guess was because the N was moved from position 4? Now we have I at position 4? so that explains.

We need to guess the word? But note: we have the pattern _ R A I N? And we know from the second guess that I and N are fixed? And the word must be valid? So the only unknown is the first letter? And we have to choose.

But note: in the game? we are supposed to guess the exact word? So we can guess ""BRAIN"", ""DRAIN"", or ""GRAIN"", etc.

But wait: we are allowed 6 tries? and we are on guess 3? We can try to guess one now? But to maximize information? However, we only have one blank? and we can test that? So we should choose a word that might be the actual word? and test it? But we don't have to worry about information because there's only one letter to test? 

Let me list possible words ending in ""RAIN"":
- BRAIN
- DRAIN
- FRAIN? (not valid)
- GRAIN
- URAIN? (not valid)
- PRAIN? (not valid)
- TRAIN? not possible? because T is excluded? by train's feedback? T(x) so absent.

So possible: BRAIN, DRAIN, GRAIN? and others that are valid? Check:
- ""DRAIN"" and ""GRAIN"" are both valid? ""BRAIN"" as well.

Also, note: ""CRAIN""? C is excluded? so no? and E doesn't appear? 

Moreover, letters we have tested: 
- Absent: C, E, T.
- Present: R, A, N, I (with positions fixed).

Since there's only one position? we don't need to test multiple? We can just pick one? It doesn't matter? because if we guess and it's wrong? we get feedback? then we can guess again? 

But we know the word must be something? And if we list the possibilities? There are many? Let's consider:

Common words: BRAIN, DRAIN, GRAIN? and FRAIN? no? but also ""URAIN"" no? ""PRAIN"" no? 

Also, ""KRAIN""? not a word? 

So let's get a list of valid -RAIN words:

Typical: BRAIN, DRAIN, GRAIN? 

Less common? ""TRAIN"" is excluded? 

So we can guess one of them? For example: BRAIN? 

But note: if we are wrong? we still have tries? 

Also, we haven't tested B, D, G? But we don't need to test letters? because we are guessing a word? 

Given that the pattern is fixed? and we have one letter? We could guess ""BRAIN"" as a common word.

But let's see if there are more than 3 possibilities? 

Another: ""FLAIN""? not valid? ""SRAIN""? not valid? ""WRAIN""? not valid? 

So the most common: BRAIN, DRAIN, GRAIN? 

We have 3? and 4 tries left? so we can guess one? 

Perhaps we can guess ""BRAIN"": 

But note: we don't know anything about B? 

Alternatively? We could guess a word that uses other letters? but we only need to test the first letter? So guessing BRAIN would test if the first letter is B? 

Similarly? we can do any word matching _RAIN? 

We must choose a valid word? 

I think the best is to guess one? Let's pick ""BRAIN"" because it starts with B? a common consonant? 

So the guess: BRAIN

Now? let's write the feedback we expect? 

If BRAIN is the secret? then all ✓? 

If not? then we get feedback: B might be ✓? or if not? then it might be absent? or in the word? 

But since we don't have other positions? only position1 matters? 

So: 
- B: if the word is BRAIN? ✓? 
- if the word is DRAIN? then B is absent? so x? 
- etc? 

Similarly? R,A,I,N are fixed? so ✓? ✓? ✓? ✓? 

Therefore? the feedback will tell us if B is in the word? Specifically? the first letter? 

Then if not? we try another? 

But we cannot? because position 2-5 are fixed? so any word we guess must have R A I N in those positions? 

So only position1 varies? 

Therefore? after BRAIN? if wrong? we can then try DRAIN? and so on? 

But we have limited tries? 

We are on guess 3? then we have 4,5,6 left? and 3 possibilities? so plenty? 

We can guess BRAIN now? 

But just to be systematic? and perhaps try the most probable? in English? ""BRAIN"" is common? 

However? we have no information? 

But perhaps we could have chosen a word that uses more untested letters? but we cannot? because the entire word except position1 is fixed? 

So we must guess a word that ends with RAIN? with a first letter not C, E, T? 

Therefore? guess BRAIN? 

Alternatively? note that we don't know B? So this guess will reveal? 

So let's go with BRAIN?Based on the cumulative feedback:

### Deductions:
- **From Guess 1 (crane):**
  - **C** and **E** are absent (✗); exclude them.
  - **R** is in position 2 (✓).
  - **A** is in position 3 (✓).
  - **N** is present but not in position 4 (-), so it must be in position 1 or 5.
- **From Guess 2 (train):**
  - **T** is absent (✗); exclude it.
  - **R** (position 2, ✓) and **A** (position 3, ✓) confirmed.
  - **I** is in position 4 (✓).
  - **N** is in position 5 (✓).

### Knowledge:
- Secret word format: `_ R A I N`  
  - Positions 2–5 are fixed: **R**, **A**, **I**, **N**.
  - Only position 1 is unknown.
- Excluded letters: **C**, **E**, **T**.
- Possible candidates for position 1: Any English letter except C/E/T, forming a valid word (e.g., BRAIN, DRAIN, GRAIN).

### Next Guess Strategy:
- Position 1 must be a new letter (not C/E/T) to complete the word.
- Since BRAIN is common and tests **B**, it’s a strong candidate:
  - If BRAIN is correct, we solve the puzzle.
  - If incorrect, feedback on **B** eliminates one option, narrowing to other candidates (e.g., DRAIN, GRAIN).",Guess 3: brain -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
