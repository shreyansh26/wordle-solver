We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) - C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) - R is not in the secret word.
 A(-) - A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 N(x) - N is not in the secret word.
 E(x) - E is not in the secret word.

 Therefore, from the first guess, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'A', but it is not in the third position (since in ""crane"", A is the third letter, and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.

 Since we know the secret word has an 'A' and it is not in the third position, the 'A' must be in either the first, second, fourth, or fifth position.

 For our next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter 'A'
 2. Does not include any of the letters that were marked as absent: C, R, N, E.
 3. Ideally, uses other common letters to test as many new letters as possible.

 Common English letters: After vowels like A, common consonants include T, S, L, P, M, etc.

 We also have to avoid C, R, N, E.

 Let's think of words with 'A' that avoid these letters.

 Possibilities: 
  We know that the word has 5 letters, and one of them is A (in a position other than third).

 Let's try to think of a word that places A in a different position to narrow down.

 Since in ""crane"" A was in position 3 (index 2) and now we want to test other positions.

 For example, we can try placing A in the first position? But we don't know if that's valid.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with A in a different position and use other common letters.

 Some ideas: 
  Words starting with A: avoid C,R,N,E -> e.g., ""ALPHS"" is not a word. We need valid words.

 Common words: 
  ""PASTA"" - but let's check if it uses excluded letters: 
    P, A, S, T, A -> no C,R,N,E? Actually, it's P-A-S-T-A -> good? 
    But note: we have two A's? That's okay because the word might have repeated letters? However, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. 
    We have to consider that the secret word might or might not have duplicates.

 However, note that in the feedback, we only see the marks per letter occurrence. Since we only have one A marked as present but wrong position, it might be one A? But it could also have two and we only got one marked? Actually, the feedback marks all occurrences: if there are two A's, then both would be marked appropriately? But wait, in our guess ""crane"" there is only one A. So if the word had two A's, we would not know.

 But in the feedback, we know that at least one A is present and must be moved.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have two A's to avoid ambiguity? Or we can use one with two A's to test?

 However, we want to maximize information. We'll avoid duplicate letters for now to simplify.

 Since we haven't tried S, T, L, P, etc., which are common.

 Example words: 
  ""SLATE"" -> but E is in the forbidden letters? E is marked as absent in the first guess, so we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use R.

 Let me recall: forbidden letters: C, R, N, E.

 So we are avoiding: C, R, N, E.

 Now, words with A and without C,R,N,E:

 Possible: 
  ""PASTA"" - uses S, T, P and A. But it is a valid word? Yes. And note: it has two A's? 
      Writing: P-A-S-T-A -> two A's? The last letter is A? So it has two A's? 
      But we don't know if the secret word has two A's. Since we haven't tested A in other positions, it's okay? 
      Actually, it might be better to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

 So let's look for a word with one A and other new common letters without duplicates.

 How about ""PAYTS""? Not a word.

 Another idea: ""PLATS"", but S is common? And that is a word? But we don't know about duplicates? Also, we have to place the A somewhere else.

 Alternatively: ""STAND"" -> but D? Also, we don't know if D is good, but more importantly, we have N? N is excluded? In ""crane"", we got N marked as absent, so we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N. So words without C,R,N,E.

 Common letters to test: T, S, L, P, M, H, D, etc.

 Let me consider: 
  ""SALTY"" -> SALTY: 
    S, A, L, T, Y -> none of C,R,N,E -> valid.

  Also, we can place A in the second position? In ""crane"" it was in third, now we put in second? That way, if the A should be in second, we'll see a ""correct"" mark? But note: the feedback only marks as correct or present (wrong position) or absent.

 So for our guess ""SALTY"":
  - If the secret word has A in the second position, we will get a ✓ for A? But wait, in ""SALTY"", A is the second letter. So if the secret word has A in the second position, then we should get ✓ for A. Otherwise, if A is elsewhere (like in first, fourth, fifth) then we might get - for A? But note: if the secret word has only one A, then if we put A in second and it is actually in, say, fifth, then we'll get - for A? And if it has two A's, then we might get one ✓ and one -? Not necessarily because we are only placing one A? But the secret word might have two? Actually, we don't know.

 Since we are guessing ""SALTY"", we have A in position 2. 

 Other options: 
  ""PLAIT"" -> P-L-A-I-T -> has I and T? Also, A is third? Same as crane? We want A in a different position? So avoid third position? 

 So ""SALTY"" seems a good candidate: A is in the second position? Wait, ""SALTY"": S (position1) A (position2) L (position3) T (position4) Y (position5).

 We are testing A in position2? Previously, in crane, it was in position3. By moving it, we can narrow down.

 Alternatively, we could put it in the first position? Like in ""ADIEU"", but we cannot use E (excluded) and we haven't tried D,U? But E is excluded.

 Avoid E.

 So: 
  A in first: ""ADMIT"" -> M and T? But D and M? And what about the vowel? We have A and I? But we don't know if I is in the word? Actually, we don't mind testing I?

  But ""ADMIT"" has no C,R,N,E? Indeed: A, D, M, I, T -> good.

  Then why not ""ADMIT""? Or ""AUDIO"", but U, D, I, O? And O is a vowel? But ""AUDIO"" is 5 letters? Yes, but note: we are avoiding E? But what about O? It's new.

 However, we might prefer to test more common consonants? 

 Let's compare:
  Option 1: ""SALTY"" tests letters: S, A, L, T, Y -> all new except A.
  Option 2: ""ADMIT"" tests letters: A, D, M, I, T -> all new except A.

 Both test four new letters? And we have S and L vs D and M? 

 We don't know which is better.

 Alternatively, we can include the A and test multiple positions? But wait, we are in the second guess.

 Considering frequency: 
  In English, S, T, L are more frequent than D, M? 

 So ""SALTY"" might be better? Or ""SLATE"" but SLATE has E which is forbidden? 

 Another candidate: ""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A? 
   Pros: tests P, S, T and A (and two A's) but we only have one A in the previous feedback? 
   Cons: duplicates? And we don't test as many letters? It uses P, A, S, T -> four distinct letters? But A appears twice? So we are testing four distinct letters? Same as others? 

 But if we choose ""PASTA"", then the duplicate A might cause confusion? For example, if the secret word has only one A, then one of the A's might be marked absent? 

 Actually, how does the feedback handle duplicates?
  For example, secret word has one A. Our guess ""PASTA"" has two A's: 
      If one A is in the correct position? Then that one is ✓ and the other is absent? 
      Or if none in correct position? Then the first occurrence that matches? But the feedback marks each letter individually? 

  The rules: 
      Each letter in the guess receives:
        ✓ if in the correct position.
        - if in the word but wrong position? But note: if the word has one A, and you have two A's, then one A would be marked as present (if it is in the word? Actually, the first occurrence? But the marking is independent? 

  Actually, the standard Wordle rule: 
      The feedback is given for each letter in the guess. For duplicate letters, if the secret word has one A, then only one of the A's in the guess will be marked as present? And the other as absent? But which one? 
      Typically, the marks are done in order: first assign the exact matches, then assign the present ones? 

  But to avoid complications, let's avoid duplicates for now? 

 So I prefer ""SALTY"" because it doesn't have duplicate letters and tests common consonants.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""SALTY"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- ✓: None  
- **-**: A (present but not in position 3)  
- **x**: C, R, N, E (absent from the secret word)  

### Key Insights:  
1. The secret word **contains A**, but A is not in position 3.  
2. The secret word **excludes C, R, N, E**.  
3. For the next guess:  
   - Must include **A** in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).  
   - Avoid using C, R, N, E.  
   - Prioritize testing common consonants like S, L, T, P, M to maximize information.  

### Selection:  
A strong next guess is **""SALTY""** (letters: S, A, L, T, Y) because:  
- Tests **A** in position 2 (new position).  
- Uses **new high-frequency letters**: S, L, T (avoiding C, R, N, E).  
- No duplicate letters, preventing ambiguity in feedback.  
- Valid 5-letter word.  

This narrows possible positions for A while probing 4 new letters.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and is generally a good starter.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) - C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) - R is not in the secret word.
 A(-) - A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 N(x) - N is not in the secret word.
 E(x) - E is not in the secret word.

 Therefore, from the first guess, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'A', but it is not in the third position (since in ""crane"", A is the third letter, and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.

 Since we know the secret word has an 'A' and it is not in the third position, the 'A' must be in either the first, second, fourth, or fifth position.

 For our next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter 'A'
 2. Does not include any of the letters that were marked as absent: C, R, N, E.
 3. Ideally, uses other common letters to test as many new letters as possible.

 Common English letters: After vowels like A, common consonants include T, S, L, P, M, etc.

 We also have to avoid C, R, N, E.

 Let's think of words with 'A' that avoid these letters.

 Possibilities: 
  We know that the word has 5 letters, and one of them is A (in a position other than third).

 Let's try to think of a word that places A in a different position to narrow down.

 Since in ""crane"" A was in position 3 (index 2) and now we want to test other positions.

 For example, we can try placing A in the first position? But we don't know if that's valid.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with A in a different position and use other common letters.

 Some ideas: 
  Words starting with A: avoid C,R,N,E -> e.g., ""ALPHS"" is not a word. We need valid words.

 Common words: 
  ""PASTA"" - but let's check if it uses excluded letters: 
    P, A, S, T, A -> no C,R,N,E? Actually, it's P-A-S-T-A -> good? 
    But note: we have two A's? That's okay because the word might have repeated letters? However, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. 
    We have to consider that the secret word might or might not have duplicates.

 However, note that in the feedback, we only see the marks per letter occurrence. Since we only have one A marked as present but wrong position, it might be one A? But it could also have two and we only got one marked? Actually, the feedback marks all occurrences: if there are two A's, then both would be marked appropriately? But wait, in our guess ""crane"" there is only one A. So if the word had two A's, we would not know.

 But in the feedback, we know that at least one A is present and must be moved.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have two A's to avoid ambiguity? Or we can use one with two A's to test?

 However, we want to maximize information. We'll avoid duplicate letters for now to simplify.

 Since we haven't tried S, T, L, P, etc., which are common.

 Example words: 
  ""SLATE"" -> but E is in the forbidden letters? E is marked as absent in the first guess, so we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use R.

 Let me recall: forbidden letters: C, R, N, E.

 So we are avoiding: C, R, N, E.

 Now, words with A and without C,R,N,E:

 Possible: 
  ""PASTA"" - uses S, T, P and A. But it is a valid word? Yes. And note: it has two A's? 
      Writing: P-A-S-T-A -> two A's? The last letter is A? So it has two A's? 
      But we don't know if the secret word has two A's. Since we haven't tested A in other positions, it's okay? 
      Actually, it might be better to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

 So let's look for a word with one A and other new common letters without duplicates.

 How about ""PAYTS""? Not a word.

 Another idea: ""PLATS"", but S is common? And that is a word? But we don't know about duplicates? Also, we have to place the A somewhere else.

 Alternatively: ""STAND"" -> but D? Also, we don't know if D is good, but more importantly, we have N? N is excluded? In ""crane"", we got N marked as absent, so we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N. So words without C,R,N,E.

 Common letters to test: T, S, L, P, M, H, D, etc.

 Let me consider: 
  ""SALTY"" -> SALTY: 
    S, A, L, T, Y -> none of C,R,N,E -> valid.

  Also, we can place A in the second position? In ""crane"" it was in third, now we put in second? That way, if the A should be in second, we'll see a ""correct"" mark? But note: the feedback only marks as correct or present (wrong position) or absent.

 So for our guess ""SALTY"":
  - If the secret word has A in the second position, we will get a ✓ for A? But wait, in ""SALTY"", A is the second letter. So if the secret word has A in the second position, then we should get ✓ for A. Otherwise, if A is elsewhere (like in first, fourth, fifth) then we might get - for A? But note: if the secret word has only one A, then if we put A in second and it is actually in, say, fifth, then we'll get - for A? And if it has two A's, then we might get one ✓ and one -? Not necessarily because we are only placing one A? But the secret word might have two? Actually, we don't know.

 Since we are guessing ""SALTY"", we have A in position 2. 

 Other options: 
  ""PLAIT"" -> P-L-A-I-T -> has I and T? Also, A is third? Same as crane? We want A in a different position? So avoid third position? 

 So ""SALTY"" seems a good candidate: A is in the second position? Wait, ""SALTY"": S (position1) A (position2) L (position3) T (position4) Y (position5).

 We are testing A in position2? Previously, in crane, it was in position3. By moving it, we can narrow down.

 Alternatively, we could put it in the first position? Like in ""ADIEU"", but we cannot use E (excluded) and we haven't tried D,U? But E is excluded.

 Avoid E.

 So: 
  A in first: ""ADMIT"" -> M and T? But D and M? And what about the vowel? We have A and I? But we don't know if I is in the word? Actually, we don't mind testing I?

  But ""ADMIT"" has no C,R,N,E? Indeed: A, D, M, I, T -> good.

  Then why not ""ADMIT""? Or ""AUDIO"", but U, D, I, O? And O is a vowel? But ""AUDIO"" is 5 letters? Yes, but note: we are avoiding E? But what about O? It's new.

 However, we might prefer to test more common consonants? 

 Let's compare:
  Option 1: ""SALTY"" tests letters: S, A, L, T, Y -> all new except A.
  Option 2: ""ADMIT"" tests letters: A, D, M, I, T -> all new except A.

 Both test four new letters? And we have S and L vs D and M? 

 We don't know which is better.

 Alternatively, we can include the A and test multiple positions? But wait, we are in the second guess.

 Considering frequency: 
  In English, S, T, L are more frequent than D, M? 

 So ""SALTY"" might be better? Or ""SLATE"" but SLATE has E which is forbidden? 

 Another candidate: ""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A? 
   Pros: tests P, S, T and A (and two A's) but we only have one A in the previous feedback? 
   Cons: duplicates? And we don't test as many letters? It uses P, A, S, T -> four distinct letters? But A appears twice? So we are testing four distinct letters? Same as others? 

 But if we choose ""PASTA"", then the duplicate A might cause confusion? For example, if the secret word has only one A, then one of the A's might be marked absent? 

 Actually, how does the feedback handle duplicates?
  For example, secret word has one A. Our guess ""PASTA"" has two A's: 
      If one A is in the correct position? Then that one is ✓ and the other is absent? 
      Or if none in correct position? Then the first occurrence that matches? But the feedback marks each letter individually? 

  The rules: 
      Each letter in the guess receives:
        ✓ if in the correct position.
        - if in the word but wrong position? But note: if the word has one A, and you have two A's, then one A would be marked as present (if it is in the word? Actually, the first occurrence? But the marking is independent? 

  Actually, the standard Wordle rule: 
      The feedback is given for each letter in the guess. For duplicate letters, if the secret word has one A, then only one of the A's in the guess will be marked as present? And the other as absent? But which one? 
      Typically, the marks are done in order: first assign the exact matches, then assign the present ones? 

  But to avoid complications, let's avoid duplicates for now? 

 So I prefer ""SALTY"" because it doesn't have duplicate letters and tests common consonants.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""SALTY"".

<guess>salty</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- ✓: None  
- **-**: A (present but not in position 3)  
- **x**: C, R, N, E (absent from the secret word)  

### Key Insights:  
1. The secret word **contains A**, but A is not in position 3.  
2. The secret word **excludes C, R, N, E**.  
3. For the next guess:  
   - Must include **A** in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).  
   - Avoid using C, R, N, E.  
   - Prioritize testing common consonants like S, L, T, P, M to maximize information.  

### Selection:  
A strong next guess is **""SALTY""** (letters: S, A, L, T, Y) because:  
- Tests **A** in position 2 (new position).  
- Uses **new high-frequency letters**: S, L, T (avoiding C, R, N, E).  
- No duplicate letters, preventing ambiguity in feedback.  
- Valid 5-letter word.  

This narrows possible positions for A while probing 4 new letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
  C: absent (x)
  R: absent (x)
  A: present but wrong position (-) -> so A is in the secret word, but not in position 3 (since in ""crane"", A is at position 3)
  N: absent (x)
  E: absent (x)

From Guess 2 (""salty""):
  S: present but wrong position (-) -> so S is in the secret word, but not in position 1 (since in ""salty"", S is first)
  A: correct position (✓) -> so A is in the secret word and specifically in position 2 (because we placed A at position 2 and got ✓)
  L: absent (x) -> so L is not in the word
  T: correct position (✓) -> so T is in the secret word and in position 4 (since we placed T at position 4 and got ✓)
  Y: absent (x) -> so Y is not in the word

Therefore, we now know:
- Correct positions:
  - Position 2 is A (from Guess 2: A(✓))
  - Position 4 is T (from Guess 2: T(✓))
- Present letters that are not yet positioned correctly:
  - S is in the word, but not at position 1. Since position 2 is A and position 4 is T, S must be in one of the remaining positions: 1, 3, or 5? But wait, we know it's not at position 1 (from the feedback on ""salty""), and we haven't tested positions 3 or 5 yet. Actually, we placed S at position 1 and it was marked wrong position, so S can be in position 3 or 5. Also, note position 2 and 4 are fixed, so only positions 1,3,5 are free? But wait, position 1 we had S and it was wrong position, but now we know position 1 must be a letter that hasn't been fixed? Actually, position 1 is open because we tried S there and it wasn't fixed. Similarly, position 3 and 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E (from first guess), L, Y (from second guess). Also, note we have tried letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,A,L,T,Y -> so absent: C,R,N,E,L,Y. And we know A, S, T are present.

Also, from the first guess, we know A was present but not in position 3, but now we have placed A in position 2 and it was correct. So A is locked at position 2.

We also know T is locked at position 4.

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: T
- Also, it must contain the letter S, which cannot be in position 1 (because we tried that) and not in position 2 (which is A) or position 4 (which is T). So S must be either in position 3 or position 5.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ A _ T _

And the S is either at position 3 or 5.

We have two blanks: position 1 and 3 (if S is at 5) OR position 1 and 5 (if S is at 3).

But note: we also need to fill the letters that haven't been tried? And we cannot use absent letters.

Absent letters: C,R,N,E,L,Y. So we avoid these.

Also, the word must be 5 letters and include S (either at 3 or 5) and the letters at positions 1 and the remaining position? Plus we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But so far, we haven't encountered duplicates? But we must be careful.

We need to guess a word that fits:
- Positions 2: A, 4: T
- The word has S (but not at 1,2,4) so must be at 3 or 5.
- Also, the word might have other letters we haven't tried? But we must avoid absent letters.

What we don't know: We don't know what is in positions 1 and the position that S isn't occupying? And we don't know which position S is in.

Strategy for the next guess:
1. Test the position of S: We can put S either at position 3 or at position 5? Then we can also test new letters at the other positions.
2. Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 5? Then we can test if S is there? Or put S at 3? We hope to get feedback that will show if S is at 3 or 5.

Let's think:
If we put S in position 3, then the word will have the form: _ A S T _
If we put S in position 5, then: _ A _ T S

We haven't tested many vowels? We have tried A, E? E is absent, so the secret word has at least one vowel? But English words have vowels? We have A (a vowel) and we don't know what else? The vowels are A,E,I,O,U. We know E is absent? And we don't know about I,O,U? So we might want to test I and O? Because U is less frequent? Also, common consonants: we have S and T? So we should test I and O? 

Options:

First, assume we put S at position 3: then the word is _ A S T _
- We need to choose position 1 and 5: with letters that are not absent? And we need a valid English word.

Similarly, if we put S at position 5: then _ A _ T S.

We don't know which one? So we can design our guess to resolve this ambiguity? 

Let's try to pick a word that has S at position 3? Then we can test if the word becomes ...AST. and we can choose letters that haven't been tried? Or we can put S at 5? 

But note: we have only 4 tries left? We need to maximize information? Also, we can test both possibilities? Actually, we can guess a word that places S in one of the possible positions? Then we’ll get feedback on S’s position? 

For example, if we put S at position 3, then:
- If the secret word indeed has S at position 3, then the feedback will mark S as correct? But if the secret word has S at position 5? Then our S at position 3 would be marked absent? (because not in the word? But wait, the secret word has S? So if the secret word has S only at 5? Then our putting S at 3? It would be marked as wrong position? Because it should be moved? 

Actually, the feedback for S:
- In the secret word, if S is only at position 5? Then we put S at position 3? Then the feedback for S would be marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position? Because S is in the word but not at 3? 
Similarly, if we put S at position 5? And the secret word has S at position 5? Then ✓? Else at position 3? Then marked as '-'? Or absent? But it’s present? So marked as '-'?

Therefore, we can test by putting S only at one possible position? And we'll know.

But also, we can test both? Actually, we can't test both in one guess? We have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 5? For example: 
  Then the word would be: _ A _ T S

Then if we get feedback: 
  Position 5: S would be ✓ if the secret word has S at 5? Otherwise, if the secret word has S at 3? Then our S at 5 would be marked as '-'? Because wrong position? 

Similarly, if we choose S at 3: 
  Then _ A S T _
  Then S at 3: ✓ if the secret has S at 3? Otherwise marked as '-'? 

But note: we only have one S? So if the secret word has only one S? Then if we put S at 3 and it's actually at 5? We'll get '-'? And if we put S at 5 and it's at 3? We also get '-'. 

But if the secret word has two S's? Then both positions 3 and 5 might be S? Then regardless, if we put S at 3? We get ✓? And if at 5? Also ✓? But we don't know.

However, so far, we have no evidence of duplicates. We can proceed with the assumption of no duplicate? But we must be cautious.

Let’s try to pick one position arbitrarily? But we can design a word that also tests new letters.

We have unused vowels: I, O, U (since E is absent? and A is already placed). Also, consonants: we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z? 

We should choose common letters: O, I, P, M, etc.

So let's form a guess:

Option: Put S at position 5? Then the word must be: _ A _ T S

We need to fill position 1 and 3? With letters that are not absent? And make a word.

Possible letters: 
Position 1: must be a letter that is not absent? Avoid C,R,N,E,L,Y? And also S is at 5? So avoid duplicated? Wait, but S is at 5? So position 1 and 3 cannot be S? But we are putting S only at 5? So position 1 and 3 must be non-S? And non A (because A is at 2)? And non T (T at 4)? So they must be new letters? 

Try to form words: e.g., 
Position 1: O? Position 3: M? Then ""O A M T S"" -> ""OAMTS""? Not a word.
Position 1: O? Position 3: P? ""O A P T S"" -> ""OAPTS""? Not a word.
Position 1: M? Position 3: P? ""M A P T S"" -> ""MAPTS""? Not a word? Wait, map as a verb? No, the word might be ""MATS"" but that’s 4 letters? 

Word: ""MASTS""? But has two S? Then we have S at 5 and S at 3? But that won't be? And also length? Wait, we are putting S at 5? But if we put S at 5? And also at 3? Then it would be duplicated? 

Another idea: ""HASTS""? Not a word? 

Better: ""HASTY""? But Y is absent? No? Y was marked absent in second guess? So cannot use? 

Alternatively, try S at position 3? The word is: _ A S T _

We need position 1 and 5? 

Examples:
Position 1: M? Position 5: P? ""M A S T P""? Not a word.
Position 1: P? Position 5: H? ""P A S T H""? ""PASTH"" not a word? ""PASTE""? But E is absent? Cannot use?
Position 1: M? Position 5: T? But T is at position 4? So duplication? And would be M A S T T? ""MASTS""? Wait, that has two T? Or two S? 

Actually, let me think of common words:

- Words ending in T: But we have T at position 4? So an T?_ At the end? 
- Or words like ""OAST""? That’s 4 letters? 5-letter words: ""BOAST"", ""COAST"", etc? But B? But also O? What words fit? 

Examples: 
- ""PASTA"", but we have T at position 4? So we need position 5? And position 1? If S at 3: P A S T A -> then position 5 A? But position 5 A? Then the word would be ""PASTA"". But note: in ""PASTA"", 
  - Position 1: P
  - Position 2: A ✓ 
  - Position 3: S? 
  - Position 4: T ✓ 
  - Position 5: A? But we already have A? So duplicated? 

But let me check: 
- The secret word has T at position 4? And we know A at position 2? And S is in the word? So in ""PASTA"", we have S at position 3? And A at position 5? 

But if we guess ""PASTA"", then what would we expect? 
- We know the secret word has S? So S at 3? Then it would be marked? And we would see for position 5? 

But wait, we have potential issues: 
- In the first guess, we had A as wrong position? But we fixed A at position 2? So A cannot be at position 5? Because if A were at 5, then in the first guess, we put A at 3? Which is wrong position? But the secret has A at 2? So we have one A? Or two? 

Actually, the feedback from first guess showed:

Guess 1: crane -> A(-) -> one A and it was in the word? So if the secret word had two A's? Then when we placed A in position 3? It should be one - and then? But we didn't get more than one mark? Actually, we only placed one A? So we saw only one mark? So it could be that there are two A's? 

But we don't know? 

In ""PASTA"", we have two A's? We place A at position 2 and at position 5? 

If we guess ""PASTA"":
  P at 1? We don't know? 
  A at 2: ✓ (we know that)
  S at 3? We hope it's S? 
  T at 4: ✓ (we know)
  A at 5? 

But what if the secret word has only one A? Then our A at 5 would be marked absent? 

But we already know A at 2 is correct? So we are testing if there is a second A? 

However, we might be better off avoiding duplicates? 

Alternatively, let’s find words without duplicates? With S at 5? And other letters?

For example, the form: _ A _ T S

What are valid words? 
  ""HAZES""? But E is absent? And Z is not common? And H? 
  ""HATES""? But E is absent? 
  ""HANTS""? N is absent? 
""GAPTS""? Not a word? 
""BAITS""? But position 3: I? Then B A I T S -> ""BAITS""?

Yes, ""BAITS"" is a word? Meaning: something used to attract.

Checking:
  B A I T S
  Avoids absent letters? B not tried? A is in? I not tried? T is in? S is in? 
  But we know A is at 2 and T at 4? So we put:
    Position 1: B
    Position 2: A (✓) 
    Position 3: I
    Position 4: T (✓)
    Position 5: S

If the secret word has S at 5? Then feedback for S would be ✓? But note: we also put S at 5? So we get ✓? And B and I would be indicated? 

But if the secret word has S at 3? Then our S at 5 would get '-'? Because it’s in the word but wrong position? 

So this guess will tell us the position of S? 

Also, we test B and I? 

If S is at 3? Then we have B and I? Which might be present or absent? If we get feedback for I as absent? Then we know B is the only other untried letter? 

So ""BAITS"" seems a good choice? 

But what about other options? Like O? 

""OATHS""? But H? 
  O A T H S? But we know T is at 4? And S is at 5? 
  But position 3: T? We have T at 4? And O at 1? T at 3 and T at 4? Duplicate T? 

""BOATS""? O? But positions: B O A T S -> then O at 2? But no, in our form it should be: Position 2 is fixed A? So first letter: B? Then position 3: O? Then position 4: T? position 5: S? So ""BOATS""? 

But ""BOATS""? Then we have O? Which we haven't tested? 

But ""BOATS"" is a valid word? 

Similarly, ""MOATS""? ""FOATS""? ""GOATS""? 

But GOATS seems good? 

But we want to test S at 5? And use common letters? 

We'll consider ""BAITS"" or ""BOATS""?

BAITS: tests B and I? 
BOATS: tests B and O? 

Both vowels? I and O? 

Frequency: O is more common? 

But I is common too? 

Alternatively, we can test with ""PASTS""? But duplicate S? And we don't know? 

I think ""BAITS"" is a legitimate choice? 

But let me see: if we use ""BAITS"", and the secret word has S at 5? Then we get:
  B: ? 
  A: ✓
  I: ?
  T: ✓
  S: ✓
Thus we get a pattern? 

If S is at 3? Then we get:
  B: ? 
  A: ✓
  I: ? 
  T: ✓
  S: -? Because misplaced? 

And we learn about B and I? 

Therefore, I will choose ""BAITS"". 

But let me check: we know that the secret word has exactly: positions 2=A, 4=T, and the letter S? Also, it might have other letters? 

We’re trying BAITS: 
  B at 1? 
  I at 3? 

This will answer the position of S? And tell us if B and I are present or absent? 

But what if S is at 3? Then our I at 3 would be? If the secret word has S at 3? Then our I at 3 must be marked absent? Because S is there? So we would get:
  B: (if present: ✓ or -? No, we put B at 1? So if B is not in the word? Marked absent? Or if in the word but in wrong position? 
  I: at 3? Then if secret word has no I? Marked absent? Or if it has I? But at a different position? Then -? 
But if S is at position 3? Then position 3 must have S? So our I at 3 cannot be correct? So I at 3 would be marked absent? Or if the secret has I elsewhere? 

Actually, we are guessing BAITS? If the secret word has S at 3? Then our guess: 
  Position 1: B -> if B is absent: x? Or if present? But we don't know?
  Position 2: A ✓
  Position 3: I -> but secret has S? So I is absent? Unless the secret has I? But that would be an additional letter? 
  Position 4: T ✓
  Position 5: S -> S is in the word? So S gets a -, because it's in the word but at 3? Not 5? 

So we would see:
  B: ? 
  A: ✓ 
  I: ? (likely absent? Or wrong position if present? But since S is at 3 and we don't know duplicates? But if I is in the word? Then it could be marked -? 
But we don't know? 

Whereas if we choose a word that doesn't put anything at 3? Then we avoid conflict? 

For example, we can choose a word like ""JUMPS"" but fit? Doesn't fit form? 

Alternatively, if we choose S at 3? And maybe a word that uses S at 3? For example, ""PASTY""? But Y is absent? 

Another idea: ""MASTS""? But duplicate S? And we don't know? 

Let's go back to Option for S at 3: 
  The word is: _ A S T _

Possible words: 
  ""BASIC"" -> C absent? 
  ""PAST""? 4 letters? 
  ""BASTE""? But E absent? 
  ""BASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
  ""GASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
""LASTS""? L is absent? 
""HASTS""? H? Then position 1: H? Position 5: T? Then form: H A S T T? Not a word? 
  Actually, ""HAST""? Not 5 letters? 

We need position 5? 

Common words: 
  ""MASTE""? Not English? 
  ""PACTS""? C absent? 
""MASKS""? K? Then M A S K S? 
  M: new? 
  S: duplicate? 
  K: new? 
  Positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T? Or wait we put S at 3? But we also have K at 4? Then position 4 cannot be T! Because we have position 4 fixed T? 

Wait, in this form, position 4 must be T! But ""MASKS"" has S at 4? Not T? So it doesn't have T at 4? 

Therefore, we must put T at 4? So the word must be? For S at 3: a word that has ... A S T ... So with letters at 1 and 5? 

What words are: [a letter]AST[another letter]? 
  BAST? -> 4 letters? 
  BASTE -> 5 letters: B A S T E -> but E is absent? 
  CASTE -> C is absent? 
  FAST? 4 letters? 
  FIST? Not? 
  HASTE -> E absent? 
  PASTE -> E absent? 
  VASTE -> not common? 
  TAST? Not? 
  WASTE -> E absent? 

Most of these end with E? which is absent? 

Other: 
  JAST? Not word? 
  MAST? 4 letters? 
  OAST? 4 letters? 
  PIST? Not? 

So maybe it's difficult? 

So we have to choose a word that has S at 5? 

Because there are words like ""BEATS""? But E absent? 
  ""BOATS"", ""COATS"", ""GOATS"", ""OATHS"" but H? 
""BOATS"" is valid: B O A T S? 
  But position 2 must be A? And we have O at position 2? -> no. 
So if we put S at 5? The form is: _ A _ T S? 
Then the word has: [letter] A [letter] T S? 

Examples: 
  ""HATTS""? Not a standard word? 
  ""MATHS"" -> M A T H S? But then position 3: T? But we are forced: position 4 must be T? So we put T at 3 and T at 4? Duplicate? 
  Actually, ""MATHS"": M A T H S -> positions: 
    1:M, 2:A, 3:T, 4:H? -> T is at 3? But we have fixed position 4: T? Contradiction? So we must have T at 4? Therefore, position 3 cannot be T? 
  So the form is: 
    Position 1: letter
    Position 2: A
    Position 3: letter (which cannot be T? Because T is at 4? And no duplication? We don't know? 
    Position 4: T
    Position 5: S

Then the word is: X A Y T S? 

And we know Y ≠ T? 

Now, what words: 
  ""EATS""? 4 letters? 
  ""BATTS""? position 3: T? Then duplicated? 
  ""HOT""? Not? 
  ""CATS""? 4 letters? 
  ""ACT ?"" 3 letters? 

Let me search: 
  ""DA VAS""? Not? 
  ""BAS""? No? 

Actually, English words: 
  ""RAT"" are shorter?

Common ones: ""MATS"" is 4 letters? 

5 letters: 
  ""BAITS"" we have already?
  ""HAITS""? Not a word? 
  ""PASTS""? Positions: P A S T S -> then position 3: S? And position 5: S? 
  ""PASTS"" is a word? Meaning of the word: yes? 

But duplication: 
  in ""PASTS"": 
    Position 1: P
    Position 2: A
    Position 3: S
    Position 4 has to be T? Yes! 
    Position 5: S

So ""PASTS"" fits the form? And does not violate?
  But note: we would put S at position 3 and at 5? 

But if the secret word has only one S? Then we might get inaccurate feedback? 

Similarly, ""MASTS""? M A S T S? 

But ""MASTS"" is a valid word: a type of pole? 

But let's go with ""BAITS"" as I thought? Or ""BOATS"" is not? Because ""BOATS"": B O A T S? But position 4: T? And position 3: O? So form: B A O T S? Then ""BOATS""? 
  But that’s not? Wait, ""BOATS"" is spelled B-O-A-T-S? So positions:
    1: B
    2: O -> but should be A? No, conflict? Because in BOATS, the second letter is O? 
  But we put A at position 2? If we try for the form: _ A _ T S? Then it cannot be ""BOATS"" because ""BOATS"" has second letter O, not A.

I see: so the word must have A at position 2? So in a guess, we set the second letter to A? So the word like ""BAITS"": B (1), A (2), I (3), T (4), S (5)? 

Similarly, ""PASTS"": P (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), S (5)? But duplicated S? 

To avoid duplicate, ""BAITS"" is better? 

Or ""MAIDS"", but D may be new? And position 5 is S? And position 4 is T? Then positions: M (1), A (2), I (3), D (4)? But we have T forced at position 4? So cannot put D at 4? 

Exactly: position 4 must be T? So we cannot change that? Therefore, for the form with S at 5? Position 3 has to be filled? And position 1.

Valid English words? 
  ""BAITS"" works? 
  ""BEATS"" has E? Who is absent? 
  ""DAISY"" but Y is absent? And position 4: T? Not Y? 
  ""GATOR"" not? 
  ""MAT"" not? 
  ""HAWTS"" not? 
  ""WARTS"" but R is absent? 

""HAZED"" has E and absent? 
 So let's list: 
   BAITS: valid? 
   PASTS: valid? 
   MASTS: valid? 
   FASTS: F, A, S, T, S -> valid? 
   FASTS: yes? 

But FASTS: position 1: F, position 5: S? And position 3: S? Duplicate? But we are testing S at 5? 

Alternatively, without S duplication: ""BAITS"" and ""MAITS"" not a word? ""GAITS""? 
  ""GAITS"": G A I T S -> that fits? 
  G at 1, A at 2, I at 3, T at 4, S at 5? 
  No duplication? 
  ""GAITS"" is a word: meaning a way of walking? 

So ""GAITS"" is an option? 

Similarly, ""RAITS""? R is absent? 
  ""WANTS"" but N absent? 

""GAITS"" is okay? 

So we have candidates: 
  ""BAITS"" or ""GAITS""? 

Either: tests G or B? And I? 

We’ve not tested B or G? 

Which is more common? B is more common than G? 

But we can choose BAITS? 

To maximize information? 

I think ""BAITS"" is fine? 

So I’ll guess ""BAITS"". 

Final guess: ""BAITS""

<guess>baits</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

From previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C❌, R❌, A➖ (present, wrong position), N❌, E❌  
  - **Key Takeaways**:  
    - A is in the secret word, but not in position 3.  
    - C, R, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: SALTY** → Feedback: S➖ (present, wrong position), A✅ (correct position), L❌, T✅ (correct position), Y❌  
  - **Key Takeaways**:  
    - A is in position 2.  
    - T is in position 4.  
    - S is present but not in position 1.  
    - L and Y are **absent**.  
    - Secret word format: `_ A _ T _` (positions 1, 3, and 5 unknown).  

### Known Constraints:
- **Confirmed Positions**:  
  - Position 2: `A`  
  - Position 4: `T`  
- **Present Letter (Wrong Position)**:  
  - `S` must be in position 3 or 5 (since it was ❌ in position 1 and positions 2/4 are fixed).  
- **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E (from Guess 1), L, Y (from Guess 2).  
- **New Letters to Test**: Focus on common unused letters (e.g., B, I, G, O, P, U) to maximize information while resolving `S`'s position.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
1. **Test `S` Position**: Prioritize a guess where `S` is placed in position 5 (since position 3 is still viable). This reveals if `S` belongs at the end while testing new letters.  
2. **Avoid Absent Letters**: Exclude C, E, L, N, R, Y.  
3. **Maximize New Information**: Use high-frequency letters like B, I, or O (since vowels/diverse consonants narrow options faster).  
4. **Valid Words**:  
   - Ideal format: `[new] A [new] T S` (if `S` is guessed in position 5).  
   - Example: **BAITS** (B✅/❔, I✅/❔, S➖/✅).  
     - If `S` is ✅, it confirms position 5.  
     - If `S` is ➖, `S` must be in position 3 (and position 5 becomes new unknown).  

### Why ""BAITS""?
- **Structure**: `B A I T S`  
  - `A` position 2 (✅ confirmed), `T` position 4 (✅ confirmed).  
  - **New Letters Tested**:  
    - `B` (position 1): High-frequency consonant.  
    - `I` (position 3): Common vowel.  
    - `S` (position 5): Tests exact placement of known `S`.  
- **Word Validity**: ""BAITS"" is a 5-letter English word.  
- **Feedback Potential**: Resolves `S`'s position and checks `B`/`I` for presence/absence in one guess.  

<guess>baits</guess>",baits,"We have feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
  C: absent (x)
  R: absent (x)
  A: present but wrong position (-) -> so A is in the secret word, but not in position 3 (since in ""crane"", A is at position 3)
  N: absent (x)
  E: absent (x)

From Guess 2 (""salty""):
  S: present but wrong position (-) -> so S is in the secret word, but not in position 1 (since in ""salty"", S is first)
  A: correct position (✓) -> so A is in the secret word and specifically in position 2 (because we placed A at position 2 and got ✓)
  L: absent (x) -> so L is not in the word
  T: correct position (✓) -> so T is in the secret word and in position 4 (since we placed T at position 4 and got ✓)
  Y: absent (x) -> so Y is not in the word

Therefore, we now know:
- Correct positions:
  - Position 2 is A (from Guess 2: A(✓))
  - Position 4 is T (from Guess 2: T(✓))
- Present letters that are not yet positioned correctly:
  - S is in the word, but not at position 1. Since position 2 is A and position 4 is T, S must be in one of the remaining positions: 1, 3, or 5? But wait, we know it's not at position 1 (from the feedback on ""salty""), and we haven't tested positions 3 or 5 yet. Actually, we placed S at position 1 and it was marked wrong position, so S can be in position 3 or 5. Also, note position 2 and 4 are fixed, so only positions 1,3,5 are free? But wait, position 1 we had S and it was wrong position, but now we know position 1 must be a letter that hasn't been fixed? Actually, position 1 is open because we tried S there and it wasn't fixed. Similarly, position 3 and 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E (from first guess), L, Y (from second guess). Also, note we have tried letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,A,L,T,Y -> so absent: C,R,N,E,L,Y. And we know A, S, T are present.

Also, from the first guess, we know A was present but not in position 3, but now we have placed A in position 2 and it was correct. So A is locked at position 2.

We also know T is locked at position 4.

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: T
- Also, it must contain the letter S, which cannot be in position 1 (because we tried that) and not in position 2 (which is A) or position 4 (which is T). So S must be either in position 3 or position 5.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ A _ T _

And the S is either at position 3 or 5.

We have two blanks: position 1 and 3 (if S is at 5) OR position 1 and 5 (if S is at 3).

But note: we also need to fill the letters that haven't been tried? And we cannot use absent letters.

Absent letters: C,R,N,E,L,Y. So we avoid these.

Also, the word must be 5 letters and include S (either at 3 or 5) and the letters at positions 1 and the remaining position? Plus we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But so far, we haven't encountered duplicates? But we must be careful.

We need to guess a word that fits:
- Positions 2: A, 4: T
- The word has S (but not at 1,2,4) so must be at 3 or 5.
- Also, the word might have other letters we haven't tried? But we must avoid absent letters.

What we don't know: We don't know what is in positions 1 and the position that S isn't occupying? And we don't know which position S is in.

Strategy for the next guess:
1. Test the position of S: We can put S either at position 3 or at position 5? Then we can also test new letters at the other positions.
2. Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 5? Then we can test if S is there? Or put S at 3? We hope to get feedback that will show if S is at 3 or 5.

Let's think:
If we put S in position 3, then the word will have the form: _ A S T _
If we put S in position 5, then: _ A _ T S

We haven't tested many vowels? We have tried A, E? E is absent, so the secret word has at least one vowel? But English words have vowels? We have A (a vowel) and we don't know what else? The vowels are A,E,I,O,U. We know E is absent? And we don't know about I,O,U? So we might want to test I and O? Because U is less frequent? Also, common consonants: we have S and T? So we should test I and O? 

Options:

First, assume we put S at position 3: then the word is _ A S T _
- We need to choose position 1 and 5: with letters that are not absent? And we need a valid English word.

Similarly, if we put S at position 5: then _ A _ T S.

We don't know which one? So we can design our guess to resolve this ambiguity? 

Let's try to pick a word that has S at position 3? Then we can test if the word becomes ...AST. and we can choose letters that haven't been tried? Or we can put S at 5? 

But note: we have only 4 tries left? We need to maximize information? Also, we can test both possibilities? Actually, we can guess a word that places S in one of the possible positions? Then we’ll get feedback on S’s position? 

For example, if we put S at position 3, then:
- If the secret word indeed has S at position 3, then the feedback will mark S as correct? But if the secret word has S at position 5? Then our S at position 3 would be marked absent? (because not in the word? But wait, the secret word has S? So if the secret word has S only at 5? Then our putting S at 3? It would be marked as wrong position? Because it should be moved? 

Actually, the feedback for S:
- In the secret word, if S is only at position 5? Then we put S at position 3? Then the feedback for S would be marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position? Because S is in the word but not at 3? 
Similarly, if we put S at position 5? And the secret word has S at position 5? Then ✓? Else at position 3? Then marked as '-'? Or absent? But it’s present? So marked as '-'?

Therefore, we can test by putting S only at one possible position? And we'll know.

But also, we can test both? Actually, we can't test both in one guess? We have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 5? For example: 
  Then the word would be: _ A _ T S

Then if we get feedback: 
  Position 5: S would be ✓ if the secret word has S at 5? Otherwise, if the secret word has S at 3? Then our S at 5 would be marked as '-'? Because wrong position? 

Similarly, if we choose S at 3: 
  Then _ A S T _
  Then S at 3: ✓ if the secret has S at 3? Otherwise marked as '-'? 

But note: we only have one S? So if the secret word has only one S? Then if we put S at 3 and it's actually at 5? We'll get '-'? And if we put S at 5 and it's at 3? We also get '-'. 

But if the secret word has two S's? Then both positions 3 and 5 might be S? Then regardless, if we put S at 3? We get ✓? And if at 5? Also ✓? But we don't know.

However, so far, we have no evidence of duplicates. We can proceed with the assumption of no duplicate? But we must be cautious.

Let’s try to pick one position arbitrarily? But we can design a word that also tests new letters.

We have unused vowels: I, O, U (since E is absent? and A is already placed). Also, consonants: we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z? 

We should choose common letters: O, I, P, M, etc.

So let's form a guess:

Option: Put S at position 5? Then the word must be: _ A _ T S

We need to fill position 1 and 3? With letters that are not absent? And make a word.

Possible letters: 
Position 1: must be a letter that is not absent? Avoid C,R,N,E,L,Y? And also S is at 5? So avoid duplicated? Wait, but S is at 5? So position 1 and 3 cannot be S? But we are putting S only at 5? So position 1 and 3 must be non-S? And non A (because A is at 2)? And non T (T at 4)? So they must be new letters? 

Try to form words: e.g., 
Position 1: O? Position 3: M? Then ""O A M T S"" -> ""OAMTS""? Not a word.
Position 1: O? Position 3: P? ""O A P T S"" -> ""OAPTS""? Not a word.
Position 1: M? Position 3: P? ""M A P T S"" -> ""MAPTS""? Not a word? Wait, map as a verb? No, the word might be ""MATS"" but that’s 4 letters? 

Word: ""MASTS""? But has two S? Then we have S at 5 and S at 3? But that won't be? And also length? Wait, we are putting S at 5? But if we put S at 5? And also at 3? Then it would be duplicated? 

Another idea: ""HASTS""? Not a word? 

Better: ""HASTY""? But Y is absent? No? Y was marked absent in second guess? So cannot use? 

Alternatively, try S at position 3? The word is: _ A S T _

We need position 1 and 5? 

Examples:
Position 1: M? Position 5: P? ""M A S T P""? Not a word.
Position 1: P? Position 5: H? ""P A S T H""? ""PASTH"" not a word? ""PASTE""? But E is absent? Cannot use?
Position 1: M? Position 5: T? But T is at position 4? So duplication? And would be M A S T T? ""MASTS""? Wait, that has two T? Or two S? 

Actually, let me think of common words:

- Words ending in T: But we have T at position 4? So an T?_ At the end? 
- Or words like ""OAST""? That’s 4 letters? 5-letter words: ""BOAST"", ""COAST"", etc? But B? But also O? What words fit? 

Examples: 
- ""PASTA"", but we have T at position 4? So we need position 5? And position 1? If S at 3: P A S T A -> then position 5 A? But position 5 A? Then the word would be ""PASTA"". But note: in ""PASTA"", 
  - Position 1: P
  - Position 2: A ✓ 
  - Position 3: S? 
  - Position 4: T ✓ 
  - Position 5: A? But we already have A? So duplicated? 

But let me check: 
- The secret word has T at position 4? And we know A at position 2? And S is in the word? So in ""PASTA"", we have S at position 3? And A at position 5? 

But if we guess ""PASTA"", then what would we expect? 
- We know the secret word has S? So S at 3? Then it would be marked? And we would see for position 5? 

But wait, we have potential issues: 
- In the first guess, we had A as wrong position? But we fixed A at position 2? So A cannot be at position 5? Because if A were at 5, then in the first guess, we put A at 3? Which is wrong position? But the secret has A at 2? So we have one A? Or two? 

Actually, the feedback from first guess showed:

Guess 1: crane -> A(-) -> one A and it was in the word? So if the secret word had two A's? Then when we placed A in position 3? It should be one - and then? But we didn't get more than one mark? Actually, we only placed one A? So we saw only one mark? So it could be that there are two A's? 

But we don't know? 

In ""PASTA"", we have two A's? We place A at position 2 and at position 5? 

If we guess ""PASTA"":
  P at 1? We don't know? 
  A at 2: ✓ (we know that)
  S at 3? We hope it's S? 
  T at 4: ✓ (we know)
  A at 5? 

But what if the secret word has only one A? Then our A at 5 would be marked absent? 

But we already know A at 2 is correct? So we are testing if there is a second A? 

However, we might be better off avoiding duplicates? 

Alternatively, let’s find words without duplicates? With S at 5? And other letters?

For example, the form: _ A _ T S

What are valid words? 
  ""HAZES""? But E is absent? And Z is not common? And H? 
  ""HATES""? But E is absent? 
  ""HANTS""? N is absent? 
""GAPTS""? Not a word? 
""BAITS""? But position 3: I? Then B A I T S -> ""BAITS""?

Yes, ""BAITS"" is a word? Meaning: something used to attract.

Checking:
  B A I T S
  Avoids absent letters? B not tried? A is in? I not tried? T is in? S is in? 
  But we know A is at 2 and T at 4? So we put:
    Position 1: B
    Position 2: A (✓) 
    Position 3: I
    Position 4: T (✓)
    Position 5: S

If the secret word has S at 5? Then feedback for S would be ✓? But note: we also put S at 5? So we get ✓? And B and I would be indicated? 

But if the secret word has S at 3? Then our S at 5 would get '-'? Because it’s in the word but wrong position? 

So this guess will tell us the position of S? 

Also, we test B and I? 

If S is at 3? Then we have B and I? Which might be present or absent? If we get feedback for I as absent? Then we know B is the only other untried letter? 

So ""BAITS"" seems a good choice? 

But what about other options? Like O? 

""OATHS""? But H? 
  O A T H S? But we know T is at 4? And S is at 5? 
  But position 3: T? We have T at 4? And O at 1? T at 3 and T at 4? Duplicate T? 

""BOATS""? O? But positions: B O A T S -> then O at 2? But no, in our form it should be: Position 2 is fixed A? So first letter: B? Then position 3: O? Then position 4: T? position 5: S? So ""BOATS""? 

But ""BOATS""? Then we have O? Which we haven't tested? 

But ""BOATS"" is a valid word? 

Similarly, ""MOATS""? ""FOATS""? ""GOATS""? 

But GOATS seems good? 

But we want to test S at 5? And use common letters? 

We'll consider ""BAITS"" or ""BOATS""?

BAITS: tests B and I? 
BOATS: tests B and O? 

Both vowels? I and O? 

Frequency: O is more common? 

But I is common too? 

Alternatively, we can test with ""PASTS""? But duplicate S? And we don't know? 

I think ""BAITS"" is a legitimate choice? 

But let me see: if we use ""BAITS"", and the secret word has S at 5? Then we get:
  B: ? 
  A: ✓
  I: ?
  T: ✓
  S: ✓
Thus we get a pattern? 

If S is at 3? Then we get:
  B: ? 
  A: ✓
  I: ? 
  T: ✓
  S: -? Because misplaced? 

And we learn about B and I? 

Therefore, I will choose ""BAITS"". 

But let me check: we know that the secret word has exactly: positions 2=A, 4=T, and the letter S? Also, it might have other letters? 

We’re trying BAITS: 
  B at 1? 
  I at 3? 

This will answer the position of S? And tell us if B and I are present or absent? 

But what if S is at 3? Then our I at 3 would be? If the secret word has S at 3? Then our I at 3 must be marked absent? Because S is there? So we would get:
  B: (if present: ✓ or -? No, we put B at 1? So if B is not in the word? Marked absent? Or if in the word but in wrong position? 
  I: at 3? Then if secret word has no I? Marked absent? Or if it has I? But at a different position? Then -? 
But if S is at position 3? Then position 3 must have S? So our I at 3 cannot be correct? So I at 3 would be marked absent? Or if the secret has I elsewhere? 

Actually, we are guessing BAITS? If the secret word has S at 3? Then our guess: 
  Position 1: B -> if B is absent: x? Or if present? But we don't know?
  Position 2: A ✓
  Position 3: I -> but secret has S? So I is absent? Unless the secret has I? But that would be an additional letter? 
  Position 4: T ✓
  Position 5: S -> S is in the word? So S gets a -, because it's in the word but at 3? Not 5? 

So we would see:
  B: ? 
  A: ✓ 
  I: ? (likely absent? Or wrong position if present? But since S is at 3 and we don't know duplicates? But if I is in the word? Then it could be marked -? 
But we don't know? 

Whereas if we choose a word that doesn't put anything at 3? Then we avoid conflict? 

For example, we can choose a word like ""JUMPS"" but fit? Doesn't fit form? 

Alternatively, if we choose S at 3? And maybe a word that uses S at 3? For example, ""PASTY""? But Y is absent? 

Another idea: ""MASTS""? But duplicate S? And we don't know? 

Let's go back to Option for S at 3: 
  The word is: _ A S T _

Possible words: 
  ""BASIC"" -> C absent? 
  ""PAST""? 4 letters? 
  ""BASTE""? But E absent? 
  ""BASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
  ""GASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
""LASTS""? L is absent? 
""HASTS""? H? Then position 1: H? Position 5: T? Then form: H A S T T? Not a word? 
  Actually, ""HAST""? Not 5 letters? 

We need position 5? 

Common words: 
  ""MASTE""? Not English? 
  ""PACTS""? C absent? 
""MASKS""? K? Then M A S K S? 
  M: new? 
  S: duplicate? 
  K: new? 
  Positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T? Or wait we put S at 3? But we also have K at 4? Then position 4 cannot be T! Because we have position 4 fixed T? 

Wait, in this form, position 4 must be T! But ""MASKS"" has S at 4? Not T? So it doesn't have T at 4? 

Therefore, we must put T at 4? So the word must be? For S at 3: a word that has ... A S T ... So with letters at 1 and 5? 

What words are: [a letter]AST[another letter]? 
  BAST? -> 4 letters? 
  BASTE -> 5 letters: B A S T E -> but E is absent? 
  CASTE -> C is absent? 
  FAST? 4 letters? 
  FIST? Not? 
  HASTE -> E absent? 
  PASTE -> E absent? 
  VASTE -> not common? 
  TAST? Not? 
  WASTE -> E absent? 

Most of these end with E? which is absent? 

Other: 
  JAST? Not word? 
  MAST? 4 letters? 
  OAST? 4 letters? 
  PIST? Not? 

So maybe it's difficult? 

So we have to choose a word that has S at 5? 

Because there are words like ""BEATS""? But E absent? 
  ""BOATS"", ""COATS"", ""GOATS"", ""OATHS"" but H? 
""BOATS"" is valid: B O A T S? 
  But position 2 must be A? And we have O at position 2? -> no. 
So if we put S at 5? The form is: _ A _ T S? 
Then the word has: [letter] A [letter] T S? 

Examples: 
  ""HATTS""? Not a standard word? 
  ""MATHS"" -> M A T H S? But then position 3: T? But we are forced: position 4 must be T? So we put T at 3 and T at 4? Duplicate? 
  Actually, ""MATHS"": M A T H S -> positions: 
    1:M, 2:A, 3:T, 4:H? -> T is at 3? But we have fixed position 4: T? Contradiction? So we must have T at 4? Therefore, position 3 cannot be T? 
  So the form is: 
    Position 1: letter
    Position 2: A
    Position 3: letter (which cannot be T? Because T is at 4? And no duplication? We don't know? 
    Position 4: T
    Position 5: S

Then the word is: X A Y T S? 

And we know Y ≠ T? 

Now, what words: 
  ""EATS""? 4 letters? 
  ""BATTS""? position 3: T? Then duplicated? 
  ""HOT""? Not? 
  ""CATS""? 4 letters? 
  ""ACT ?"" 3 letters? 

Let me search: 
  ""DA VAS""? Not? 
  ""BAS""? No? 

Actually, English words: 
  ""RAT"" are shorter?

Common ones: ""MATS"" is 4 letters? 

5 letters: 
  ""BAITS"" we have already?
  ""HAITS""? Not a word? 
  ""PASTS""? Positions: P A S T S -> then position 3: S? And position 5: S? 
  ""PASTS"" is a word? Meaning of the word: yes? 

But duplication: 
  in ""PASTS"": 
    Position 1: P
    Position 2: A
    Position 3: S
    Position 4 has to be T? Yes! 
    Position 5: S

So ""PASTS"" fits the form? And does not violate?
  But note: we would put S at position 3 and at 5? 

But if the secret word has only one S? Then we might get inaccurate feedback? 

Similarly, ""MASTS""? M A S T S? 

But ""MASTS"" is a valid word: a type of pole? 

But let's go with ""BAITS"" as I thought? Or ""BOATS"" is not? Because ""BOATS"": B O A T S? But position 4: T? And position 3: O? So form: B A O T S? Then ""BOATS""? 
  But that’s not? Wait, ""BOATS"" is spelled B-O-A-T-S? So positions:
    1: B
    2: O -> but should be A? No, conflict? Because in BOATS, the second letter is O? 
  But we put A at position 2? If we try for the form: _ A _ T S? Then it cannot be ""BOATS"" because ""BOATS"" has second letter O, not A.

I see: so the word must have A at position 2? So in a guess, we set the second letter to A? So the word like ""BAITS"": B (1), A (2), I (3), T (4), S (5)? 

Similarly, ""PASTS"": P (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), S (5)? But duplicated S? 

To avoid duplicate, ""BAITS"" is better? 

Or ""MAIDS"", but D may be new? And position 5 is S? And position 4 is T? Then positions: M (1), A (2), I (3), D (4)? But we have T forced at position 4? So cannot put D at 4? 

Exactly: position 4 must be T? So we cannot change that? Therefore, for the form with S at 5? Position 3 has to be filled? And position 1.

Valid English words? 
  ""BAITS"" works? 
  ""BEATS"" has E? Who is absent? 
  ""DAISY"" but Y is absent? And position 4: T? Not Y? 
  ""GATOR"" not? 
  ""MAT"" not? 
  ""HAWTS"" not? 
  ""WARTS"" but R is absent? 

""HAZED"" has E and absent? 
 So let's list: 
   BAITS: valid? 
   PASTS: valid? 
   MASTS: valid? 
   FASTS: F, A, S, T, S -> valid? 
   FASTS: yes? 

But FASTS: position 1: F, position 5: S? And position 3: S? Duplicate? But we are testing S at 5? 

Alternatively, without S duplication: ""BAITS"" and ""MAITS"" not a word? ""GAITS""? 
  ""GAITS"": G A I T S -> that fits? 
  G at 1, A at 2, I at 3, T at 4, S at 5? 
  No duplication? 
  ""GAITS"" is a word: meaning a way of walking? 

So ""GAITS"" is an option? 

Similarly, ""RAITS""? R is absent? 
  ""WANTS"" but N absent? 

""GAITS"" is okay? 

So we have candidates: 
  ""BAITS"" or ""GAITS""? 

Either: tests G or B? And I? 

We’ve not tested B or G? 

Which is more common? B is more common than G? 

But we can choose BAITS? 

To maximize information? 

I think ""BAITS"" is fine? 

So I’ll guess ""BAITS"". 

Final guess: ""BAITS""

<guess>baits</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

From previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C❌, R❌, A➖ (present, wrong position), N❌, E❌  
  - **Key Takeaways**:  
    - A is in the secret word, but not in position 3.  
    - C, R, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: SALTY** → Feedback: S➖ (present, wrong position), A✅ (correct position), L❌, T✅ (correct position), Y❌  
  - **Key Takeaways**:  
    - A is in position 2.  
    - T is in position 4.  
    - S is present but not in position 1.  
    - L and Y are **absent**.  
    - Secret word format: `_ A _ T _` (positions 1, 3, and 5 unknown).  

### Known Constraints:
- **Confirmed Positions**:  
  - Position 2: `A`  
  - Position 4: `T`  
- **Present Letter (Wrong Position)**:  
  - `S` must be in position 3 or 5 (since it was ❌ in position 1 and positions 2/4 are fixed).  
- **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E (from Guess 1), L, Y (from Guess 2).  
- **New Letters to Test**: Focus on common unused letters (e.g., B, I, G, O, P, U) to maximize information while resolving `S`'s position.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
1. **Test `S` Position**: Prioritize a guess where `S` is placed in position 5 (since position 3 is still viable). This reveals if `S` belongs at the end while testing new letters.  
2. **Avoid Absent Letters**: Exclude C, E, L, N, R, Y.  
3. **Maximize New Information**: Use high-frequency letters like B, I, or O (since vowels/diverse consonants narrow options faster).  
4. **Valid Words**:  
   - Ideal format: `[new] A [new] T S` (if `S` is guessed in position 5).  
   - Example: **BAITS** (B✅/❔, I✅/❔, S➖/✅).  
     - If `S` is ✅, it confirms position 5.  
     - If `S` is ➖, `S` must be in position 3 (and position 5 becomes new unknown).  

### Why ""BAITS""?
- **Structure**: `B A I T S`  
  - `A` position 2 (✅ confirmed), `T` position 4 (✅ confirmed).  
  - **New Letters Tested**:  
    - `B` (position 1): High-frequency consonant.  
    - `I` (position 3): Common vowel.  
    - `S` (position 5): Tests exact placement of known `S`.  
- **Word Validity**: ""BAITS"" is a 5-letter English word.  
- **Feedback Potential**: Resolves `S`'s position and checks `B`/`I` for presence/absence in one guess.",Guess 3: baits -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) I(x) T(✓) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,PASTA,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and is generally a good starter.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) - C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) - R is not in the secret word.
 A(-) - A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 N(x) - N is not in the secret word.
 E(x) - E is not in the secret word.

 Therefore, from the first guess, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'A', but it is not in the third position (since in ""crane"", A is the third letter, and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.

 Since we know the secret word has an 'A' and it is not in the third position, the 'A' must be in either the first, second, fourth, or fifth position.

 For our next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter 'A'
 2. Does not include any of the letters that were marked as absent: C, R, N, E.
 3. Ideally, uses other common letters to test as many new letters as possible.

 Common English letters: After vowels like A, common consonants include T, S, L, P, M, etc.

 We also have to avoid C, R, N, E.

 Let's think of words with 'A' that avoid these letters.

 Possibilities: 
  We know that the word has 5 letters, and one of them is A (in a position other than third).

 Let's try to think of a word that places A in a different position to narrow down.

 Since in ""crane"" A was in position 3 (index 2) and now we want to test other positions.

 For example, we can try placing A in the first position? But we don't know if that's valid.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with A in a different position and use other common letters.

 Some ideas: 
  Words starting with A: avoid C,R,N,E -> e.g., ""ALPHS"" is not a word. We need valid words.

 Common words: 
  ""PASTA"" - but let's check if it uses excluded letters: 
    P, A, S, T, A -> no C,R,N,E? Actually, it's P-A-S-T-A -> good? 
    But note: we have two A's? That's okay because the word might have repeated letters? However, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. 
    We have to consider that the secret word might or might not have duplicates.

 However, note that in the feedback, we only see the marks per letter occurrence. Since we only have one A marked as present but wrong position, it might be one A? But it could also have two and we only got one marked? Actually, the feedback marks all occurrences: if there are two A's, then both would be marked appropriately? But wait, in our guess ""crane"" there is only one A. So if the word had two A's, we would not know.

 But in the feedback, we know that at least one A is present and must be moved.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have two A's to avoid ambiguity? Or we can use one with two A's to test?

 However, we want to maximize information. We'll avoid duplicate letters for now to simplify.

 Since we haven't tried S, T, L, P, etc., which are common.

 Example words: 
  ""SLATE"" -> but E is in the forbidden letters? E is marked as absent in the first guess, so we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use R.

 Let me recall: forbidden letters: C, R, N, E.

 So we are avoiding: C, R, N, E.

 Now, words with A and without C,R,N,E:

 Possible: 
  ""PASTA"" - uses S, T, P and A. But it is a valid word? Yes. And note: it has two A's? 
      Writing: P-A-S-T-A -> two A's? The last letter is A? So it has two A's? 
      But we don't know if the secret word has two A's. Since we haven't tested A in other positions, it's okay? 
      Actually, it might be better to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

 So let's look for a word with one A and other new common letters without duplicates.

 How about ""PAYTS""? Not a word.

 Another idea: ""PLATS"", but S is common? And that is a word? But we don't know about duplicates? Also, we have to place the A somewhere else.

 Alternatively: ""STAND"" -> but D? Also, we don't know if D is good, but more importantly, we have N? N is excluded? In ""crane"", we got N marked as absent, so we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N. So words without C,R,N,E.

 Common letters to test: T, S, L, P, M, H, D, etc.

 Let me consider: 
  ""SALTY"" -> SALTY: 
    S, A, L, T, Y -> none of C,R,N,E -> valid.

  Also, we can place A in the second position? In ""crane"" it was in third, now we put in second? That way, if the A should be in second, we'll see a ""correct"" mark? But note: the feedback only marks as correct or present (wrong position) or absent.

 So for our guess ""SALTY"":
  - If the secret word has A in the second position, we will get a ✓ for A? But wait, in ""SALTY"", A is the second letter. So if the secret word has A in the second position, then we should get ✓ for A. Otherwise, if A is elsewhere (like in first, fourth, fifth) then we might get - for A? But note: if the secret word has only one A, then if we put A in second and it is actually in, say, fifth, then we'll get - for A? And if it has two A's, then we might get one ✓ and one -? Not necessarily because we are only placing one A? But the secret word might have two? Actually, we don't know.

 Since we are guessing ""SALTY"", we have A in position 2. 

 Other options: 
  ""PLAIT"" -> P-L-A-I-T -> has I and T? Also, A is third? Same as crane? We want A in a different position? So avoid third position? 

 So ""SALTY"" seems a good candidate: A is in the second position? Wait, ""SALTY"": S (position1) A (position2) L (position3) T (position4) Y (position5).

 We are testing A in position2? Previously, in crane, it was in position3. By moving it, we can narrow down.

 Alternatively, we could put it in the first position? Like in ""ADIEU"", but we cannot use E (excluded) and we haven't tried D,U? But E is excluded.

 Avoid E.

 So: 
  A in first: ""ADMIT"" -> M and T? But D and M? And what about the vowel? We have A and I? But we don't know if I is in the word? Actually, we don't mind testing I?

  But ""ADMIT"" has no C,R,N,E? Indeed: A, D, M, I, T -> good.

  Then why not ""ADMIT""? Or ""AUDIO"", but U, D, I, O? And O is a vowel? But ""AUDIO"" is 5 letters? Yes, but note: we are avoiding E? But what about O? It's new.

 However, we might prefer to test more common consonants? 

 Let's compare:
  Option 1: ""SALTY"" tests letters: S, A, L, T, Y -> all new except A.
  Option 2: ""ADMIT"" tests letters: A, D, M, I, T -> all new except A.

 Both test four new letters? And we have S and L vs D and M? 

 We don't know which is better.

 Alternatively, we can include the A and test multiple positions? But wait, we are in the second guess.

 Considering frequency: 
  In English, S, T, L are more frequent than D, M? 

 So ""SALTY"" might be better? Or ""SLATE"" but SLATE has E which is forbidden? 

 Another candidate: ""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A? 
   Pros: tests P, S, T and A (and two A's) but we only have one A in the previous feedback? 
   Cons: duplicates? And we don't test as many letters? It uses P, A, S, T -> four distinct letters? But A appears twice? So we are testing four distinct letters? Same as others? 

 But if we choose ""PASTA"", then the duplicate A might cause confusion? For example, if the secret word has only one A, then one of the A's might be marked absent? 

 Actually, how does the feedback handle duplicates?
  For example, secret word has one A. Our guess ""PASTA"" has two A's: 
      If one A is in the correct position? Then that one is ✓ and the other is absent? 
      Or if none in correct position? Then the first occurrence that matches? But the feedback marks each letter individually? 

  The rules: 
      Each letter in the guess receives:
        ✓ if in the correct position.
        - if in the word but wrong position? But note: if the word has one A, and you have two A's, then one A would be marked as present (if it is in the word? Actually, the first occurrence? But the marking is independent? 

  Actually, the standard Wordle rule: 
      The feedback is given for each letter in the guess. For duplicate letters, if the secret word has one A, then only one of the A's in the guess will be marked as present? And the other as absent? But which one? 
      Typically, the marks are done in order: first assign the exact matches, then assign the present ones? 

  But to avoid complications, let's avoid duplicates for now? 

 So I prefer ""SALTY"" because it doesn't have duplicate letters and tests common consonants.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""SALTY"".

<guess>salty</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- ✓: None  
- **-**: A (present but not in position 3)  
- **x**: C, R, N, E (absent from the secret word)  

### Key Insights:  
1. The secret word **contains A**, but A is not in position 3.  
2. The secret word **excludes C, R, N, E**.  
3. For the next guess:  
   - Must include **A** in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).  
   - Avoid using C, R, N, E.  
   - Prioritize testing common consonants like S, L, T, P, M to maximize information.  

### Selection:  
A strong next guess is **""SALTY""** (letters: S, A, L, T, Y) because:  
- Tests **A** in position 2 (new position).  
- Uses **new high-frequency letters**: S, L, T (avoiding C, R, N, E).  
- No duplicate letters, preventing ambiguity in feedback.  
- Valid 5-letter word.  

This narrows possible positions for A while probing 4 new letters.

<guess>salty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(✓) L(x) T(✓) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
  C: absent (x)
  R: absent (x)
  A: present but wrong position (-) -> so A is in the secret word, but not in position 3 (since in ""crane"", A is at position 3)
  N: absent (x)
  E: absent (x)

From Guess 2 (""salty""):
  S: present but wrong position (-) -> so S is in the secret word, but not in position 1 (since in ""salty"", S is first)
  A: correct position (✓) -> so A is in the secret word and specifically in position 2 (because we placed A at position 2 and got ✓)
  L: absent (x) -> so L is not in the word
  T: correct position (✓) -> so T is in the secret word and in position 4 (since we placed T at position 4 and got ✓)
  Y: absent (x) -> so Y is not in the word

Therefore, we now know:
- Correct positions:
  - Position 2 is A (from Guess 2: A(✓))
  - Position 4 is T (from Guess 2: T(✓))
- Present letters that are not yet positioned correctly:
  - S is in the word, but not at position 1. Since position 2 is A and position 4 is T, S must be in one of the remaining positions: 1, 3, or 5? But wait, we know it's not at position 1 (from the feedback on ""salty""), and we haven't tested positions 3 or 5 yet. Actually, we placed S at position 1 and it was marked wrong position, so S can be in position 3 or 5. Also, note position 2 and 4 are fixed, so only positions 1,3,5 are free? But wait, position 1 we had S and it was wrong position, but now we know position 1 must be a letter that hasn't been fixed? Actually, position 1 is open because we tried S there and it wasn't fixed. Similarly, position 3 and 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E (from first guess), L, Y (from second guess). Also, note we have tried letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,A,L,T,Y -> so absent: C,R,N,E,L,Y. And we know A, S, T are present.

Also, from the first guess, we know A was present but not in position 3, but now we have placed A in position 2 and it was correct. So A is locked at position 2.

We also know T is locked at position 4.

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: T
- Also, it must contain the letter S, which cannot be in position 1 (because we tried that) and not in position 2 (which is A) or position 4 (which is T). So S must be either in position 3 or position 5.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ A _ T _

And the S is either at position 3 or 5.

We have two blanks: position 1 and 3 (if S is at 5) OR position 1 and 5 (if S is at 3).

But note: we also need to fill the letters that haven't been tried? And we cannot use absent letters.

Absent letters: C,R,N,E,L,Y. So we avoid these.

Also, the word must be 5 letters and include S (either at 3 or 5) and the letters at positions 1 and the remaining position? Plus we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But so far, we haven't encountered duplicates? But we must be careful.

We need to guess a word that fits:
- Positions 2: A, 4: T
- The word has S (but not at 1,2,4) so must be at 3 or 5.
- Also, the word might have other letters we haven't tried? But we must avoid absent letters.

What we don't know: We don't know what is in positions 1 and the position that S isn't occupying? And we don't know which position S is in.

Strategy for the next guess:
1. Test the position of S: We can put S either at position 3 or at position 5? Then we can also test new letters at the other positions.
2. Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 5? Then we can test if S is there? Or put S at 3? We hope to get feedback that will show if S is at 3 or 5.

Let's think:
If we put S in position 3, then the word will have the form: _ A S T _
If we put S in position 5, then: _ A _ T S

We haven't tested many vowels? We have tried A, E? E is absent, so the secret word has at least one vowel? But English words have vowels? We have A (a vowel) and we don't know what else? The vowels are A,E,I,O,U. We know E is absent? And we don't know about I,O,U? So we might want to test I and O? Because U is less frequent? Also, common consonants: we have S and T? So we should test I and O? 

Options:

First, assume we put S at position 3: then the word is _ A S T _
- We need to choose position 1 and 5: with letters that are not absent? And we need a valid English word.

Similarly, if we put S at position 5: then _ A _ T S.

We don't know which one? So we can design our guess to resolve this ambiguity? 

Let's try to pick a word that has S at position 3? Then we can test if the word becomes ...AST. and we can choose letters that haven't been tried? Or we can put S at 5? 

But note: we have only 4 tries left? We need to maximize information? Also, we can test both possibilities? Actually, we can guess a word that places S in one of the possible positions? Then we’ll get feedback on S’s position? 

For example, if we put S at position 3, then:
- If the secret word indeed has S at position 3, then the feedback will mark S as correct? But if the secret word has S at position 5? Then our S at position 3 would be marked absent? (because not in the word? But wait, the secret word has S? So if the secret word has S only at 5? Then our putting S at 3? It would be marked as wrong position? Because it should be moved? 

Actually, the feedback for S:
- In the secret word, if S is only at position 5? Then we put S at position 3? Then the feedback for S would be marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position? Because S is in the word but not at 3? 
Similarly, if we put S at position 5? And the secret word has S at position 5? Then ✓? Else at position 3? Then marked as '-'? Or absent? But it’s present? So marked as '-'?

Therefore, we can test by putting S only at one possible position? And we'll know.

But also, we can test both? Actually, we can't test both in one guess? We have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 5? For example: 
  Then the word would be: _ A _ T S

Then if we get feedback: 
  Position 5: S would be ✓ if the secret word has S at 5? Otherwise, if the secret word has S at 3? Then our S at 5 would be marked as '-'? Because wrong position? 

Similarly, if we choose S at 3: 
  Then _ A S T _
  Then S at 3: ✓ if the secret has S at 3? Otherwise marked as '-'? 

But note: we only have one S? So if the secret word has only one S? Then if we put S at 3 and it's actually at 5? We'll get '-'? And if we put S at 5 and it's at 3? We also get '-'. 

But if the secret word has two S's? Then both positions 3 and 5 might be S? Then regardless, if we put S at 3? We get ✓? And if at 5? Also ✓? But we don't know.

However, so far, we have no evidence of duplicates. We can proceed with the assumption of no duplicate? But we must be cautious.

Let’s try to pick one position arbitrarily? But we can design a word that also tests new letters.

We have unused vowels: I, O, U (since E is absent? and A is already placed). Also, consonants: we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z? 

We should choose common letters: O, I, P, M, etc.

So let's form a guess:

Option: Put S at position 5? Then the word must be: _ A _ T S

We need to fill position 1 and 3? With letters that are not absent? And make a word.

Possible letters: 
Position 1: must be a letter that is not absent? Avoid C,R,N,E,L,Y? And also S is at 5? So avoid duplicated? Wait, but S is at 5? So position 1 and 3 cannot be S? But we are putting S only at 5? So position 1 and 3 must be non-S? And non A (because A is at 2)? And non T (T at 4)? So they must be new letters? 

Try to form words: e.g., 
Position 1: O? Position 3: M? Then ""O A M T S"" -> ""OAMTS""? Not a word.
Position 1: O? Position 3: P? ""O A P T S"" -> ""OAPTS""? Not a word.
Position 1: M? Position 3: P? ""M A P T S"" -> ""MAPTS""? Not a word? Wait, map as a verb? No, the word might be ""MATS"" but that’s 4 letters? 

Word: ""MASTS""? But has two S? Then we have S at 5 and S at 3? But that won't be? And also length? Wait, we are putting S at 5? But if we put S at 5? And also at 3? Then it would be duplicated? 

Another idea: ""HASTS""? Not a word? 

Better: ""HASTY""? But Y is absent? No? Y was marked absent in second guess? So cannot use? 

Alternatively, try S at position 3? The word is: _ A S T _

We need position 1 and 5? 

Examples:
Position 1: M? Position 5: P? ""M A S T P""? Not a word.
Position 1: P? Position 5: H? ""P A S T H""? ""PASTH"" not a word? ""PASTE""? But E is absent? Cannot use?
Position 1: M? Position 5: T? But T is at position 4? So duplication? And would be M A S T T? ""MASTS""? Wait, that has two T? Or two S? 

Actually, let me think of common words:

- Words ending in T: But we have T at position 4? So an T?_ At the end? 
- Or words like ""OAST""? That’s 4 letters? 5-letter words: ""BOAST"", ""COAST"", etc? But B? But also O? What words fit? 

Examples: 
- ""PASTA"", but we have T at position 4? So we need position 5? And position 1? If S at 3: P A S T A -> then position 5 A? But position 5 A? Then the word would be ""PASTA"". But note: in ""PASTA"", 
  - Position 1: P
  - Position 2: A ✓ 
  - Position 3: S? 
  - Position 4: T ✓ 
  - Position 5: A? But we already have A? So duplicated? 

But let me check: 
- The secret word has T at position 4? And we know A at position 2? And S is in the word? So in ""PASTA"", we have S at position 3? And A at position 5? 

But if we guess ""PASTA"", then what would we expect? 
- We know the secret word has S? So S at 3? Then it would be marked? And we would see for position 5? 

But wait, we have potential issues: 
- In the first guess, we had A as wrong position? But we fixed A at position 2? So A cannot be at position 5? Because if A were at 5, then in the first guess, we put A at 3? Which is wrong position? But the secret has A at 2? So we have one A? Or two? 

Actually, the feedback from first guess showed:

Guess 1: crane -> A(-) -> one A and it was in the word? So if the secret word had two A's? Then when we placed A in position 3? It should be one - and then? But we didn't get more than one mark? Actually, we only placed one A? So we saw only one mark? So it could be that there are two A's? 

But we don't know? 

In ""PASTA"", we have two A's? We place A at position 2 and at position 5? 

If we guess ""PASTA"":
  P at 1? We don't know? 
  A at 2: ✓ (we know that)
  S at 3? We hope it's S? 
  T at 4: ✓ (we know)
  A at 5? 

But what if the secret word has only one A? Then our A at 5 would be marked absent? 

But we already know A at 2 is correct? So we are testing if there is a second A? 

However, we might be better off avoiding duplicates? 

Alternatively, let’s find words without duplicates? With S at 5? And other letters?

For example, the form: _ A _ T S

What are valid words? 
  ""HAZES""? But E is absent? And Z is not common? And H? 
  ""HATES""? But E is absent? 
  ""HANTS""? N is absent? 
""GAPTS""? Not a word? 
""BAITS""? But position 3: I? Then B A I T S -> ""BAITS""?

Yes, ""BAITS"" is a word? Meaning: something used to attract.

Checking:
  B A I T S
  Avoids absent letters? B not tried? A is in? I not tried? T is in? S is in? 
  But we know A is at 2 and T at 4? So we put:
    Position 1: B
    Position 2: A (✓) 
    Position 3: I
    Position 4: T (✓)
    Position 5: S

If the secret word has S at 5? Then feedback for S would be ✓? But note: we also put S at 5? So we get ✓? And B and I would be indicated? 

But if the secret word has S at 3? Then our S at 5 would get '-'? Because it’s in the word but wrong position? 

So this guess will tell us the position of S? 

Also, we test B and I? 

If S is at 3? Then we have B and I? Which might be present or absent? If we get feedback for I as absent? Then we know B is the only other untried letter? 

So ""BAITS"" seems a good choice? 

But what about other options? Like O? 

""OATHS""? But H? 
  O A T H S? But we know T is at 4? And S is at 5? 
  But position 3: T? We have T at 4? And O at 1? T at 3 and T at 4? Duplicate T? 

""BOATS""? O? But positions: B O A T S -> then O at 2? But no, in our form it should be: Position 2 is fixed A? So first letter: B? Then position 3: O? Then position 4: T? position 5: S? So ""BOATS""? 

But ""BOATS""? Then we have O? Which we haven't tested? 

But ""BOATS"" is a valid word? 

Similarly, ""MOATS""? ""FOATS""? ""GOATS""? 

But GOATS seems good? 

But we want to test S at 5? And use common letters? 

We'll consider ""BAITS"" or ""BOATS""?

BAITS: tests B and I? 
BOATS: tests B and O? 

Both vowels? I and O? 

Frequency: O is more common? 

But I is common too? 

Alternatively, we can test with ""PASTS""? But duplicate S? And we don't know? 

I think ""BAITS"" is a legitimate choice? 

But let me see: if we use ""BAITS"", and the secret word has S at 5? Then we get:
  B: ? 
  A: ✓
  I: ?
  T: ✓
  S: ✓
Thus we get a pattern? 

If S is at 3? Then we get:
  B: ? 
  A: ✓
  I: ? 
  T: ✓
  S: -? Because misplaced? 

And we learn about B and I? 

Therefore, I will choose ""BAITS"". 

But let me check: we know that the secret word has exactly: positions 2=A, 4=T, and the letter S? Also, it might have other letters? 

We’re trying BAITS: 
  B at 1? 
  I at 3? 

This will answer the position of S? And tell us if B and I are present or absent? 

But what if S is at 3? Then our I at 3 would be? If the secret word has S at 3? Then our I at 3 must be marked absent? Because S is there? So we would get:
  B: (if present: ✓ or -? No, we put B at 1? So if B is not in the word? Marked absent? Or if in the word but in wrong position? 
  I: at 3? Then if secret word has no I? Marked absent? Or if it has I? But at a different position? Then -? 
But if S is at position 3? Then position 3 must have S? So our I at 3 cannot be correct? So I at 3 would be marked absent? Or if the secret has I elsewhere? 

Actually, we are guessing BAITS? If the secret word has S at 3? Then our guess: 
  Position 1: B -> if B is absent: x? Or if present? But we don't know?
  Position 2: A ✓
  Position 3: I -> but secret has S? So I is absent? Unless the secret has I? But that would be an additional letter? 
  Position 4: T ✓
  Position 5: S -> S is in the word? So S gets a -, because it's in the word but at 3? Not 5? 

So we would see:
  B: ? 
  A: ✓ 
  I: ? (likely absent? Or wrong position if present? But since S is at 3 and we don't know duplicates? But if I is in the word? Then it could be marked -? 
But we don't know? 

Whereas if we choose a word that doesn't put anything at 3? Then we avoid conflict? 

For example, we can choose a word like ""JUMPS"" but fit? Doesn't fit form? 

Alternatively, if we choose S at 3? And maybe a word that uses S at 3? For example, ""PASTY""? But Y is absent? 

Another idea: ""MASTS""? But duplicate S? And we don't know? 

Let's go back to Option for S at 3: 
  The word is: _ A S T _

Possible words: 
  ""BASIC"" -> C absent? 
  ""PAST""? 4 letters? 
  ""BASTE""? But E absent? 
  ""BASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
  ""GASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
""LASTS""? L is absent? 
""HASTS""? H? Then position 1: H? Position 5: T? Then form: H A S T T? Not a word? 
  Actually, ""HAST""? Not 5 letters? 

We need position 5? 

Common words: 
  ""MASTE""? Not English? 
  ""PACTS""? C absent? 
""MASKS""? K? Then M A S K S? 
  M: new? 
  S: duplicate? 
  K: new? 
  Positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T? Or wait we put S at 3? But we also have K at 4? Then position 4 cannot be T! Because we have position 4 fixed T? 

Wait, in this form, position 4 must be T! But ""MASKS"" has S at 4? Not T? So it doesn't have T at 4? 

Therefore, we must put T at 4? So the word must be? For S at 3: a word that has ... A S T ... So with letters at 1 and 5? 

What words are: [a letter]AST[another letter]? 
  BAST? -> 4 letters? 
  BASTE -> 5 letters: B A S T E -> but E is absent? 
  CASTE -> C is absent? 
  FAST? 4 letters? 
  FIST? Not? 
  HASTE -> E absent? 
  PASTE -> E absent? 
  VASTE -> not common? 
  TAST? Not? 
  WASTE -> E absent? 

Most of these end with E? which is absent? 

Other: 
  JAST? Not word? 
  MAST? 4 letters? 
  OAST? 4 letters? 
  PIST? Not? 

So maybe it's difficult? 

So we have to choose a word that has S at 5? 

Because there are words like ""BEATS""? But E absent? 
  ""BOATS"", ""COATS"", ""GOATS"", ""OATHS"" but H? 
""BOATS"" is valid: B O A T S? 
  But position 2 must be A? And we have O at position 2? -> no. 
So if we put S at 5? The form is: _ A _ T S? 
Then the word has: [letter] A [letter] T S? 

Examples: 
  ""HATTS""? Not a standard word? 
  ""MATHS"" -> M A T H S? But then position 3: T? But we are forced: position 4 must be T? So we put T at 3 and T at 4? Duplicate? 
  Actually, ""MATHS"": M A T H S -> positions: 
    1:M, 2:A, 3:T, 4:H? -> T is at 3? But we have fixed position 4: T? Contradiction? So we must have T at 4? Therefore, position 3 cannot be T? 
  So the form is: 
    Position 1: letter
    Position 2: A
    Position 3: letter (which cannot be T? Because T is at 4? And no duplication? We don't know? 
    Position 4: T
    Position 5: S

Then the word is: X A Y T S? 

And we know Y ≠ T? 

Now, what words: 
  ""EATS""? 4 letters? 
  ""BATTS""? position 3: T? Then duplicated? 
  ""HOT""? Not? 
  ""CATS""? 4 letters? 
  ""ACT ?"" 3 letters? 

Let me search: 
  ""DA VAS""? Not? 
  ""BAS""? No? 

Actually, English words: 
  ""RAT"" are shorter?

Common ones: ""MATS"" is 4 letters? 

5 letters: 
  ""BAITS"" we have already?
  ""HAITS""? Not a word? 
  ""PASTS""? Positions: P A S T S -> then position 3: S? And position 5: S? 
  ""PASTS"" is a word? Meaning of the word: yes? 

But duplication: 
  in ""PASTS"": 
    Position 1: P
    Position 2: A
    Position 3: S
    Position 4 has to be T? Yes! 
    Position 5: S

So ""PASTS"" fits the form? And does not violate?
  But note: we would put S at position 3 and at 5? 

But if the secret word has only one S? Then we might get inaccurate feedback? 

Similarly, ""MASTS""? M A S T S? 

But ""MASTS"" is a valid word: a type of pole? 

But let's go with ""BAITS"" as I thought? Or ""BOATS"" is not? Because ""BOATS"": B O A T S? But position 4: T? And position 3: O? So form: B A O T S? Then ""BOATS""? 
  But that’s not? Wait, ""BOATS"" is spelled B-O-A-T-S? So positions:
    1: B
    2: O -> but should be A? No, conflict? Because in BOATS, the second letter is O? 
  But we put A at position 2? If we try for the form: _ A _ T S? Then it cannot be ""BOATS"" because ""BOATS"" has second letter O, not A.

I see: so the word must have A at position 2? So in a guess, we set the second letter to A? So the word like ""BAITS"": B (1), A (2), I (3), T (4), S (5)? 

Similarly, ""PASTS"": P (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), S (5)? But duplicated S? 

To avoid duplicate, ""BAITS"" is better? 

Or ""MAIDS"", but D may be new? And position 5 is S? And position 4 is T? Then positions: M (1), A (2), I (3), D (4)? But we have T forced at position 4? So cannot put D at 4? 

Exactly: position 4 must be T? So we cannot change that? Therefore, for the form with S at 5? Position 3 has to be filled? And position 1.

Valid English words? 
  ""BAITS"" works? 
  ""BEATS"" has E? Who is absent? 
  ""DAISY"" but Y is absent? And position 4: T? Not Y? 
  ""GATOR"" not? 
  ""MAT"" not? 
  ""HAWTS"" not? 
  ""WARTS"" but R is absent? 

""HAZED"" has E and absent? 
 So let's list: 
   BAITS: valid? 
   PASTS: valid? 
   MASTS: valid? 
   FASTS: F, A, S, T, S -> valid? 
   FASTS: yes? 

But FASTS: position 1: F, position 5: S? And position 3: S? Duplicate? But we are testing S at 5? 

Alternatively, without S duplication: ""BAITS"" and ""MAITS"" not a word? ""GAITS""? 
  ""GAITS"": G A I T S -> that fits? 
  G at 1, A at 2, I at 3, T at 4, S at 5? 
  No duplication? 
  ""GAITS"" is a word: meaning a way of walking? 

So ""GAITS"" is an option? 

Similarly, ""RAITS""? R is absent? 
  ""WANTS"" but N absent? 

""GAITS"" is okay? 

So we have candidates: 
  ""BAITS"" or ""GAITS""? 

Either: tests G or B? And I? 

We’ve not tested B or G? 

Which is more common? B is more common than G? 

But we can choose BAITS? 

To maximize information? 

I think ""BAITS"" is fine? 

So I’ll guess ""BAITS"". 

Final guess: ""BAITS""

<guess>baits</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

From previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C❌, R❌, A➖ (present, wrong position), N❌, E❌  
  - **Key Takeaways**:  
    - A is in the secret word, but not in position 3.  
    - C, R, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: SALTY** → Feedback: S➖ (present, wrong position), A✅ (correct position), L❌, T✅ (correct position), Y❌  
  - **Key Takeaways**:  
    - A is in position 2.  
    - T is in position 4.  
    - S is present but not in position 1.  
    - L and Y are **absent**.  
    - Secret word format: `_ A _ T _` (positions 1, 3, and 5 unknown).  

### Known Constraints:
- **Confirmed Positions**:  
  - Position 2: `A`  
  - Position 4: `T`  
- **Present Letter (Wrong Position)**:  
  - `S` must be in position 3 or 5 (since it was ❌ in position 1 and positions 2/4 are fixed).  
- **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E (from Guess 1), L, Y (from Guess 2).  
- **New Letters to Test**: Focus on common unused letters (e.g., B, I, G, O, P, U) to maximize information while resolving `S`'s position.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
1. **Test `S` Position**: Prioritize a guess where `S` is placed in position 5 (since position 3 is still viable). This reveals if `S` belongs at the end while testing new letters.  
2. **Avoid Absent Letters**: Exclude C, E, L, N, R, Y.  
3. **Maximize New Information**: Use high-frequency letters like B, I, or O (since vowels/diverse consonants narrow options faster).  
4. **Valid Words**:  
   - Ideal format: `[new] A [new] T S` (if `S` is guessed in position 5).  
   - Example: **BAITS** (B✅/❔, I✅/❔, S➖/✅).  
     - If `S` is ✅, it confirms position 5.  
     - If `S` is ➖, `S` must be in position 3 (and position 5 becomes new unknown).  

### Why ""BAITS""?
- **Structure**: `B A I T S`  
  - `A` position 2 (✅ confirmed), `T` position 4 (✅ confirmed).  
  - **New Letters Tested**:  
    - `B` (position 1): High-frequency consonant.  
    - `I` (position 3): Common vowel.  
    - `S` (position 5): Tests exact placement of known `S`.  
- **Word Validity**: ""BAITS"" is a 5-letter English word.  
- **Feedback Potential**: Resolves `S`'s position and checks `B`/`I` for presence/absence in one guess.

Includes the letter \'A\'\n 2. Does not include any of the letters that were marked as absent: C, R, N, E.\n 3. Ideally, uses other common letters to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Common English letters: After vowels like A, common consonants include T, S, L, P, M, etc.\n\n We also have to avoid C, R, N, E.\n\n Let\'s think of words with \'A\' that avoid these letters.\n\n Possibilities: \n  We know that the word has 5 letters, and one of them is A (in a position other than third).\n\n Let\'s try to think of a word that places A in a different position to narrow down.\n\n Since in ""crane"" A was in position 3 (index 2) and now we want to test other positions.\n\n For example, we can try placing A in the first position? But we don\'t know if that\'s valid.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word with A in a different position and use other common letters.\n\n Some ideas: \n  Words starting with A: avoid C,R,N,E -> e.g., ""ALPHS"" is not a word. We need valid words.\n\n Common words: \n  ""PASTA"" - but let\'s check if it uses excluded letters: \n    P, A, S, T, A -> no C,R,N,E? Actually, it\'s P-A-S-T-A -> good? \n    But note: we have two A\'s? That\'s okay because the word might have repeated letters? However, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. \n    We have to consider that the secret word might or might not have duplicates.\n\n However, note that in the feedback, we only see the marks per letter occurrence. Since we only have one A marked as present but wrong position, it might be one A? But it could also have two and we only got one marked? Actually, the feedback marks all occurrences: if there are two A\'s, then both would be marked appropriately? But wait, in our guess ""crane"" there is only one A. So if the word had two A\'s, we would not know.\n\n But in the feedback, we know that at least one A is present and must be moved.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have two A\'s to avoid ambiguity? Or we can use one with two A\'s to test?\n\n However, we want to maximize information. We\'ll avoid duplicate letters for now to simplify.\n\n Since we haven\'t tried S, T, L, P, etc., which are common.\n\n Example words: \n  ""SLATE"" -> but E is in the forbidden letters? E is marked as absent in the first guess, so we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use R.\n\n Let me recall: forbidden letters: C, R, N, E.\n\n So we are avoiding: C, R, N, E.\n\n Now, words with A and without C,R,N,E:\n\n Possible: \n  ""PASTA"" - uses S, T, P and A. But it is a valid word? Yes. And note: it has two A\'s? \n      Writing: P-A-S-T-A -> two A\'s? The last letter is A? So it has two A\'s? \n      But we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. Since we haven\'t tested A in other positions, it\'s okay? \n      Actually, it might be better to avoid duplicates to test more letters.\n\n So let\'s look for a word with one A and other new common letters without duplicates.\n\n How about ""PAYTS""? Not a word.\n\n Another idea: ""PLATS"", but S is common? And that is a word? But we don\'t know about duplicates? Also, we have to place the A somewhere else.\n\n Alternatively: ""STAND"" -> but D? Also, we don\'t know if D is good, but more importantly, we have N? N is excluded? In ""crane"", we got N marked as absent, so we cannot use N.\n\n We must avoid N. So words without C,R,N,E.\n\n Common letters to test: T, S, L, P, M, H, D, etc.\n\n Let me consider: \n  ""SALTY"" -> SALTY: \n    S, A, L, T, Y -> none of C,R,N,E -> valid.\n\n  Also, we can place A in the second position? In ""crane"" it was in third, now we put in second? That way, if the A should be in second, we\'ll see a ""correct"" mark? But note: the feedback only marks as correct or present (wrong position) or absent.\n\n So for our guess ""SALTY"":\n  - If the secret word has A in the second position, we will get a ✓ for A? But wait, in ""SALTY"", A is the second letter. So if the secret word has A in the second position, then we should get ✓ for A. Otherwise, if A is elsewhere (like in first, fourth, fifth) then we might get - for A? But note: if the secret word has only one A, then if we put A in second and it is actually in, say, fifth, then we\'ll get - for A? And if it has two A\'s, then we might get one ✓ and one -? Not necessarily because we are only placing one A? But the secret word might have two? Actually, we don\'t know.\n\n Since we are guessing ""SALTY"", we have A in position 2. \n\n Other options: \n  ""PLAIT"" -> P-L-A-I-T -> has I and T? Also, A is third? Same as crane? We want A in a different position? So avoid third position? \n\n So ""SALTY"" seems a good candidate: A is in the second position? Wait, ""SALTY"": S (position1) A (position2) L (position3) T (position4) Y (position5).\n\n We are testing A in position2? Previously, in crane, it was in position3. By moving it, we can narrow down.\n\n Alternatively, we could put it in the first position? Like in ""ADIEU"", but we cannot use E (excluded) and we haven\'t tried D,U? But E is excluded.\n\n Avoid E.\n\n So: \n  A in first: ""ADMIT"" -> M and T? But D and M? And what about the vowel? We have A and I? But we don\'t know if I is in the word? Actually, we don\'t mind testing I?\n\n  But ""ADMIT"" has no C,R,N,E? Indeed: A, D, M, I, T -> good.\n\n  Then why not ""ADMIT""? Or ""AUDIO"", but U, D, I, O? And O is a vowel? But ""AUDIO"" is 5 letters? Yes, but note: we are avoiding E? But what about O? It\'s new.\n\n However, we might prefer to test more common consonants? \n\n Let\'s compare:\n  Option 1: ""SALTY"" tests letters: S, A, L, T, Y -> all new except A.\n  Option 2: ""ADMIT"" tests letters: A, D, M, I, T -> all new except A.\n\n Both test four new letters? And we have S and L vs D and M? \n\n We don\'t know which is better.\n\n Alternatively, we can include the A and test multiple positions? But wait, we are in the second guess.\n\n Considering frequency: \n  In English, S, T, L are more frequent than D, M? \n\n So ""SALTY"" might be better? Or ""SLATE"" but SLATE has E which is forbidden? \n\n Another candidate: ""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A? \n   Pros: tests P, S, T and A (and two A\'s) but we only have one A in the previous feedback? \n   Cons: duplicates? And we don\'t test as many letters? It uses P, A, S, T -> four distinct letters? But A appears twice? So we are testing four distinct letters? Same as others? \n\n But if we choose ""PASTA"", then the duplicate A might cause confusion? For example, if the secret word has only one A, then one of the A\'s might be marked absent? \n\n Actually, how does the feedback handle duplicates?\n  For example, secret word has one A. Our guess ""PASTA"" has two A\'s: \n      If one A is in the correct position? Then that one is ✓ and the other is absent? \n      Or if none in correct position? Then the first occurrence that matches? But the feedback marks each letter individually? \n\n  The rules: \n      Each letter in the guess receives:\n        ✓ if in the correct position.\n        - if in the word but wrong position? But note: if the word has one A, and you have two A\'s, then one A would be marked as present (if it is in the word? Actually, the first occurrence? But the marking is independent? \n\n  Actually, the standard Wordle rule: \n      The feedback is given for each letter in the guess. For duplicate letters, if the secret word has one A, then only one of the A\'s in the guess will be marked as present? And the other as absent? But which one? \n      Typically, the marks are done in order: first assign the exact matches, then assign the present ones? \n\n  But to avoid complications, let\'s avoid duplicates for now? \n\n So I prefer ""SALTY"" because it doesn\'t have duplicate letters and tests common consonants.\n\n Therefore, my second guess is ""SALTY"".\n\n<guess>salty</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- ✓: None  \n- **-**: A (present but not in position 3)  \n- **x**: C, R, N, E (absent from the secret word)  \n\n### Key Insights:  \n1. The secret word **contains A**, but A is not in position 3.  \n2. The secret word **excludes C, R, N, E**.  \n3. For the next guess:  \n   - Must include **A** in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).  \n   - Avoid using C, R, N, E.  \n   - Prioritize testing common consonants like S, L, T, P, M to maximize information.  \n\n### Selection:  \nA strong next guess is **""SALTY""** (letters: S, A, L, T, Y) because:  \n- Tests **A** in position 2 (new position).  \n- Uses **new high-frequency letters**: S, L, T (avoiding C, R, N, E).  \n- No duplicate letters, preventing ambiguity in feedback.  \n- Valid 5-letter word.  \n\nThis narrows possible positions for A while probing 4 new letters.\n\n<guess>salty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(✓) L(x) T(✓) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""crane""):\n  C: absent (x)\n  R: absent (x)\n  A: present but wrong position (-) -> so A is in the secret word, but not in position 3 (since in ""crane"", A is at position 3)\n  N: absent (x)\n  E: absent (x)\n\nFrom Guess 2 (""salty""):\n  S: present but wrong position (-) -> so S is in the secret word, but not in position 1 (since in ""salty"", S is first)\n  A: correct position (✓) -> so A is in the secret word and specifically in position 2 (because we placed A at position 2 and got ✓)\n  L: absent (x) -> so L is not in the word\n  T: correct position (✓) -> so T is in the secret word and in position 4 (since we placed T at position 4 and got ✓)\n  Y: absent (x) -> so Y is not in the word\n\nTherefore, we now know:\n- Correct positions:\n  - Position 2 is A (from Guess 2: A(✓))\n  - Position 4 is T (from Guess 2: T(✓))\n- Present letters that are not yet positioned correctly:\n  - S is in the word, but not at position 1. Since position 2 is A and position 4 is T, S must be in one of the remaining positions: 1, 3, or 5? But wait, we know it\'s not at position 1 (from the feedback on ""salty""), and we haven\'t tested positions 3 or 5 yet. Actually, we placed S at position 1 and it was marked wrong position, so S can be in position 3 or 5. Also, note position 2 and 4 are fixed, so only positions 1,3,5 are free? But wait, position 1 we had S and it was wrong position, but now we know position 1 must be a letter that hasn\'t been fixed? Actually, position 1 is open because we tried S there and it wasn\'t fixed. Similarly, position 3 and 5.\n- Absent letters: C, R, N, E (from first guess), L, Y (from second guess). Also, note we have tried letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,A,L,T,Y -> so absent: C,R,N,E,L,Y. And we know A, S, T are present.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know A was present but not in position 3, but now we have placed A in position 2 and it was correct. So A is locked at position 2.\n\nWe also know T is locked at position 4.\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 4: T\n- Also, it must contain the letter S, which cannot be in position 1 (because we tried that) and not in position 2 (which is A) or position 4 (which is T). So S must be either in position 3 or position 5.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is of the form: _ A _ T _\n\nAnd the S is either at position 3 or 5.\n\nWe have two blanks: position 1 and 3 (if S is at 5) OR position 1 and 5 (if S is at 3).\n\nBut note: we also need to fill the letters that haven\'t been tried? And we cannot use absent letters.\n\nAbsent letters: C,R,N,E,L,Y. So we avoid these.\n\nAlso, the word must be 5 letters and include S (either at 3 or 5) and the letters at positions 1 and the remaining position? Plus we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters? But so far, we haven\'t encountered duplicates? But we must be careful.\n\nWe need to guess a word that fits:\n- Positions 2: A, 4: T\n- The word has S (but not at 1,2,4) so must be at 3 or 5.\n- Also, the word might have other letters we haven\'t tried? But we must avoid absent letters.\n\nWhat we don\'t know: We don\'t know what is in positions 1 and the position that S isn\'t occupying? And we don\'t know which position S is in.\n\nStrategy for the next guess:\n1. Test the position of S: We can put S either at position 3 or at position 5? Then we can also test new letters at the other positions.\n2. Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 5? Then we can test if S is there? Or put S at 3? We hope to get feedback that will show if S is at 3 or 5.\n\nLet\'s think:\nIf we put S in position 3, then the word will have the form: _ A S T _\nIf we put S in position 5, then: _ A _ T S\n\nWe haven\'t tested many vowels? We have tried A, E? E is absent, so the secret word has at least one vowel? But English words have vowels? We have A (a vowel) and we don\'t know what else? The vowels are A,E,I,O,U. We know E is absent? And we don\'t know about I,O,U? So we might want to test I and O? Because U is less frequent? Also, common consonants: we have S and T? So we should test I and O? \n\nOptions:\n\nFirst, assume we put S at position 3: then the word is _ A S T _\n- We need to choose position 1 and 5: with letters that are not absent? And we need a valid English word.\n\nSimilarly, if we put S at position 5: then _ A _ T S.\n\nWe don\'t know which one? So we can design our guess to resolve this ambiguity? \n\nLet\'s try to pick a word that has S at position 3? Then we can test if the word becomes ...AST. and we can choose letters that haven\'t been tried? Or we can put S at 5? \n\nBut note: we have only 4 tries left? We need to maximize information? Also, we can test both possibilities? Actually, we can guess a word that places S in one of the possible positions? Then we’ll get feedback on S’s position? \n\nFor example, if we put S at position 3, then:\n- If the secret word indeed has S at position 3, then the feedback will mark S as correct? But if the secret word has S at position 5? Then our S at position 3 would be marked absent? (because not in the word? But wait, the secret word has S? So if the secret word has S only at 5? Then our putting S at 3? It would be marked as wrong position? Because it should be moved? \n\nActually, the feedback for S:\n- In the secret word, if S is only at position 5? Then we put S at position 3? Then the feedback for S would be marked as \'-\', meaning present but wrong position? Because S is in the word but not at 3? \nSimilarly, if we put S at position 5? And the secret word has S at position 5? Then ✓? Else at position 3? Then marked as \'-\'? Or absent? But it’s present? So marked as \'-\'?\n\nTherefore, we can test by putting S only at one possible position? And we\'ll know.\n\nBut also, we can test both? Actually, we can\'t test both in one guess? We have to pick one.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has S at position 5? For example: \n  Then the word would be: _ A _ T S\n\nThen if we get feedback: \n  Position 5: S would be ✓ if the secret word has S at 5? Otherwise, if the secret word has S at 3? Then our S at 5 would be marked as \'-\'? Because wrong position? \n\nSimilarly, if we choose S at 3: \n  Then _ A S T _\n  Then S at 3: ✓ if the secret has S at 3? Otherwise marked as \'-\'? \n\nBut note: we only have one S? So if the secret word has only one S? Then if we put S at 3 and it\'s actually at 5? We\'ll get \'-\'? And if we put S at 5 and it\'s at 3? We also get \'-\'. \n\nBut if the secret word has two S\'s? Then both positions 3 and 5 might be S? Then regardless, if we put S at 3? We get ✓? And if at 5? Also ✓? But we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, so far, we have no evidence of duplicates. We can proceed with the assumption of no duplicate? But we must be cautious.\n\nLet’s try to pick one position arbitrarily? But we can design a word that also tests new letters.\n\nWe have unused vowels: I, O, U (since E is absent? and A is already placed). Also, consonants: we haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z? \n\nWe should choose common letters: O, I, P, M, etc.\n\nSo let\'s form a guess:\n\nOption: Put S at position 5? Then the word must be: _ A _ T S\n\nWe need to fill position 1 and 3? With letters that are not absent? And make a word.\n\nPossible letters: \nPosition 1: must be a letter that is not absent? Avoid C,R,N,E,L,Y? And also S is at 5? So avoid duplicated? Wait, but S is at 5? So position 1 and 3 cannot be S? But we are putting S only at 5? So position 1 and 3 must be non-S? And non A (because A is at 2)? And non T (T at 4)? So they must be new letters? \n\nTry to form words: e.g., \nPosition 1: O? Position 3: M? Then ""O A M T S"" -> ""OAMTS""? Not a word.\nPosition 1: O? Position 3: P? ""O A P T S"" -> ""OAPTS""? Not a word.\nPosition 1: M? Position 3: P? ""M A P T S"" -> ""MAPTS""? Not a word? Wait, map as a verb? No, the word might be ""MATS"" but that’s 4 letters? \n\nWord: ""MASTS""? But has two S? Then we have S at 5 and S at 3? But that won\'t be? And also length? Wait, we are putting S at 5? But if we put S at 5? And also at 3? Then it would be duplicated? \n\nAnother idea: ""HASTS""? Not a word? \n\nBetter: ""HASTY""? But Y is absent? No? Y was marked absent in second guess? So cannot use? \n\nAlternatively, try S at position 3? The word is: _ A S T _\n\nWe need position 1 and 5? \n\nExamples:\nPosition 1: M? Position 5: P? ""M A S T P""? Not a word.\nPosition 1: P? Position 5: H? ""P A S T H""? ""PASTH"" not a word? ""PASTE""? But E is absent? Cannot use?\nPosition 1: M? Position 5: T? But T is at position 4? So duplication? And would be M A S T T? ""MASTS""? Wait, that has two T? Or two S? \n\nActually, let me think of common words:\n\n- Words ending in T: But we have T at position 4? So an T?_ At the end? \n- Or words like ""OAST""? That’s 4 letters? 5-letter words: ""BOAST"", ""COAST"", etc? But B? But also O? What words fit? \n\nExamples: \n- ""PASTA"", but we have T at position 4? So we need position 5? And position 1? If S at 3: P A S T A -> then position 5 A? But position 5 A? Then the word would be ""PASTA"". But note: in ""PASTA"", \n  - Position 1: P\n  - Position 2: A ✓ \n  - Position 3: S? \n  - Position 4: T ✓ \n  - Position 5: A? But we already have A? So duplicated? \n\nBut let me check: \n- The secret word has T at position 4? And we know A at position 2? And S is in the word? So in ""PASTA"", we have S at position 3? And A at position 5? \n\nBut if we guess ""PASTA"", then what would we expect? \n- We know the secret word has S? So S at 3? Then it would be marked? And we would see for position 5? \n\nBut wait, we have potential issues: \n- In the first guess, we had A as wrong position? But we fixed A at position 2? So A cannot be at position 5? Because if A were at 5, then in the first guess, we put A at 3? Which is wrong position? But the secret has A at 2? So we have one A? Or two? \n\nActually, the feedback from first guess showed:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> A(-) -> one A and it was in the word? So if the secret word had two A\'s? Then when we placed A in position 3? It should be one - and then? But we didn\'t get more than one mark? Actually, we only placed one A? So we saw only one mark? So it could be that there are two A\'s? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nIn ""PASTA"", we have two A\'s? We place A at position 2 and at position 5? \n\nIf we guess ""PASTA"":\n  P at 1? We don\'t know? \n  A at 2: ✓ (we know that)\n  S at 3? We hope it\'s S? \n  T at 4: ✓ (we know)\n  A at 5? \n\nBut what if the secret word has only one A? Then our A at 5 would be marked absent? \n\nBut we already know A at 2 is correct? So we are testing if there is a second A? \n\nHowever, we might be better off avoiding duplicates? \n\nAlternatively, let’s find words without duplicates? With S at 5? And other letters?\n\nFor example, the form: _ A _ T S\n\nWhat are valid words? \n  ""HAZES""? But E is absent? And Z is not common? And H? \n  ""HATES""? But E is absent? \n  ""HANTS""? N is absent? \n""GAPTS""? Not a word? \n""BAITS""? But position 3: I? Then B A I T S -> ""BAITS""?\n\nYes, ""BAITS"" is a word? Meaning: something used to attract.\n\nChecking:\n  B A I T S\n  Avoids absent letters? B not tried? A is in? I not tried? T is in? S is in? \n  But we know A is at 2 and T at 4? So we put:\n    Position 1: B\n    Position 2: A (✓) \n    Position 3: I\n    Position 4: T (✓)\n    Position 5: S\n\nIf the secret word has S at 5? Then feedback for S would be ✓? But note: we also put S at 5? So we get ✓? And B and I would be indicated? \n\nBut if the secret word has S at 3? Then our S at 5 would get \'-\'? Because it’s in the word but wrong position? \n\nSo this guess will tell us the position of S? \n\nAlso, we test B and I? \n\nIf S is at 3? Then we have B and I? Which might be present or absent? If we get feedback for I as absent? Then we know B is the only other untried letter? \n\nSo ""BAITS"" seems a good choice? \n\nBut what about other options? Like O? \n\n""OATHS""? But H? \n  O A T H S? But we know T is at 4? And S is at 5? \n  But position 3: T? We have T at 4? And O at 1? T at 3 and T at 4? Duplicate T? \n\n""BOATS""? O? But positions: B O A T S -> then O at 2? But no, in our form it should be: Position 2 is fixed A? So first letter: B? Then position 3: O? Then position 4: T? position 5: S? So ""BOATS""? \n\nBut ""BOATS""? Then we have O? Which we haven\'t tested? \n\nBut ""BOATS"" is a valid word? \n\nSimilarly, ""MOATS""? ""FOATS""? ""GOATS""? \n\nBut GOATS seems good? \n\nBut we want to test S at 5? And use common letters? \n\nWe\'ll consider ""BAITS"" or ""BOATS""?\n\nBAITS: tests B and I? \nBOATS: tests B and O? \n\nBoth vowels? I and O? \n\nFrequency: O is more common? \n\nBut I is common too? \n\nAlternatively, we can test with ""PASTS""? But duplicate S? And we don\'t know? \n\nI think ""BAITS"" is a legitimate choice? \n\nBut let me see: if we use ""BAITS"", and the secret word has S at 5? Then we get:\n  B: ? \n  A: ✓\n  I: ?\n  T: ✓\n  S: ✓\nThus we get a pattern? \n\nIf S is at 3? Then we get:\n  B: ? \n  A: ✓\n  I: ? \n  T: ✓\n  S: -? Because misplaced? \n\nAnd we learn about B and I? \n\nTherefore, I will choose ""BAITS"". \n\nBut let me check: we know that the secret word has exactly: positions 2=A, 4=T, and the letter S? Also, it might have other letters? \n\nWe’re trying BAITS: \n  B at 1? \n  I at 3? \n\nThis will answer the position of S? And tell us if B and I are present or absent? \n\nBut what if S is at 3? Then our I at 3 would be? If the secret word has S at 3? Then our I at 3 must be marked absent? Because S is there? So we would get:\n  B: (if present: ✓ or -? No, we put B at 1? So if B is not in the word? Marked absent? Or if in the word but in wrong position? \n  I: at 3? Then if secret word has no I? Marked absent? Or if it has I? But at a different position? Then -? \nBut if S is at position 3? Then position 3 must have S? So our I at 3 cannot be correct? So I at 3 would be marked absent? Or if the secret has I elsewhere? \n\nActually, we are guessing BAITS? If the secret word has S at 3? Then our guess: \n  Position 1: B -> if B is absent: x? Or if present? But we don\'t know?\n  Position 2: A ✓\n  Position 3: I -> but secret has S? So I is absent? Unless the secret has I? But that would be an additional letter? \n  Position 4: T ✓\n  Position 5: S -> S is in the word? So S gets a -, because it\'s in the word but at 3? Not 5? \n\nSo we would see:\n  B: ? \n  A: ✓ \n  I: ? (likely absent? Or wrong position if present? But since S is at 3 and we don\'t know duplicates? But if I is in the word? Then it could be marked -? \nBut we don\'t know? \n\nWhereas if we choose a word that doesn\'t put anything at 3? Then we avoid conflict? \n\nFor example, we can choose a word like ""JUMPS"" but fit? Doesn\'t fit form? \n\nAlternatively, if we choose S at 3? And maybe a word that uses S at 3? For example, ""PASTY""? But Y is absent? \n\nAnother idea: ""MASTS""? But duplicate S? And we don\'t know? \n\nLet\'s go back to Option for S at 3: \n  The word is: _ A S T _\n\nPossible words: \n  ""BASIC"" -> C absent? \n  ""PAST""? 4 letters? \n  ""BASTE""? But E absent? \n  ""BASTS"" -> duplicate S? \n  ""GASTS"" -> duplicate S? \n""LASTS""? L is absent? \n""HASTS""? H? Then position 1: H? Position 5: T? Then form: H A S T T? Not a word? \n  Actually, ""HAST""? Not 5 letters? \n\nWe need position 5? \n\nCommon words: \n  ""MASTE""? Not English? \n  ""PACTS""? C absent? \n""MASKS""? K? Then M A S K S? \n  M: new? \n  S: duplicate? \n  K: new? \n  Positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T? Or wait we put S at 3? But we also have K at 4? Then position 4 cannot be T! Because we have position 4 fixed T? \n\nWait, in this form, position 4 must be T! But ""MASKS"" has S at 4? Not T? So it doesn\'t have T at 4? \n\nTherefore, we must put T at 4? So the word must be? For S at 3: a word that has ... A S T ... So with letters at 1 and 5? \n\nWhat words are: [a letter]AST[another letter]? \n  BAST? -> 4 letters? \n  BASTE -> 5 letters: B A S T E -> but E is absent? \n  CASTE -> C is absent? \n  FAST? 4 letters? \n  FIST? Not? \n  HASTE -> E absent? \n  PASTE -> E absent? \n  VASTE -> not common? \n  TAST? Not? \n  WASTE -> E absent? \n\nMost of these end with E? which is absent? \n\nOther: \n  JAST? Not word? \n  MAST? 4 letters? \n  OAST? 4 letters? \n  PIST? Not? \n\nSo maybe it\'s difficult? \n\nSo we have to choose a word that has S at 5? \n\nBecause there are words like ""BEATS""? But E absent? \n  ""BOATS"", ""COATS"", ""GOATS"", ""OATHS"" but H? \n""BOATS"" is valid: B O A T S? \n  But position 2 must be A? And we have O at position 2? -> no. \nSo if we put S at 5? The form is: _ A _ T S? \nThen the word has: [letter] A [letter] T S? \n\nExamples: \n  ""HATTS""? Not a standard word? \n  ""MATHS"" -> M A T H S? But then position 3: T? But we are forced: position 4 must be T? So we put T at 3 and T at 4? Duplicate? \n  Actually, ""MATHS"": M A T H S -> positions: \n    1:M, 2:A, 3:T, 4:H? -> T is at 3? But we have fixed position 4: T? Contradiction? So we must have T at 4? Therefore, position 3 cannot be T? \n  So the form is: \n    Position 1: letter\n    Position 2: A\n    Position 3: letter (which cannot be T? Because T is at 4? And no duplication? We don\'t know? \n    Position 4: T\n    Position 5: S\n\nThen the word is: X A Y T S? \n\nAnd we know Y ≠ T? \n\nNow, what words: \n  ""EATS""? 4 letters? \n  ""BATTS""? position 3: T? Then duplicated? \n  ""HOT""? Not? \n  ""CATS""? 4 letters? \n  ""ACT ?"" 3 letters? \n\nLet me search: \n  ""DA VAS""? Not? \n  ""BAS""? No? \n\nActually, English words: \n  ""RAT"" are shorter?\n\nCommon ones: ""MATS"" is 4 letters? \n\n5 letters: \n  ""BAITS"" we have already?\n  ""HAITS""? Not a word? \n  ""PASTS""? Positions: P A S T S -> then position 3: S? And position 5: S? \n  ""PASTS"" is a word? Meaning of the word: yes? \n\nBut duplication: \n  in ""PASTS"": \n    Position 1: P\n    Position 2: A\n    Position 3: S\n    Position 4 has to be T? Yes! \n    Position 5: S\n\nSo ""PASTS"" fits the form? And does not violate?\n  But note: we would put S at position 3 and at 5? \n\nBut if the secret word has only one S? Then we might get inaccurate feedback? \n\nSimilarly, ""MASTS""? M A S T S? \n\nBut ""MASTS"" is a valid word: a type of pole? \n\nBut let\'s go with ""BAITS"" as I thought? Or ""BOATS"" is not? Because ""BOATS"": B O A T S? But position 4: T? And position 3: O? So form: B A O T S? Then ""BOATS""? \n  But that’s not? Wait, ""BOATS"" is spelled B-O-A-T-S? So positions:\n    1: B\n    2: O -> but should be A? No, conflict? Because in BOATS, the second letter is O? \n  But we put A at position 2? If we try for the form: _ A _ T S? Then it cannot be ""BOATS"" because ""BOATS"" has second letter O, not A.\n\nI see: so the word must have A at position 2? So in a guess, we set the second letter to A? So the word like ""BAITS"": B (1), A (2), I (3), T (4), S (5)? \n\nSimilarly, ""PASTS"": P (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), S (5)? But duplicated S? \n\nTo avoid duplicate, ""BAITS"" is better? \n\nOr ""MAIDS"", but D may be new? And position 5 is S? And position 4 is T? Then positions: M (1), A (2), I (3), D (4)? But we have T forced at position 4? So cannot put D at 4? \n\nExactly: position 4 must be T? So we cannot change that? Therefore, for the form with S at 5? Position 3 has to be filled? And position 1.\n\nValid English words? \n  ""BAITS"" works? \n  ""BEATS"" has E? Who is absent? \n  ""DAISY"" but Y is absent? And position 4: T? Not Y? \n  ""GATOR"" not? \n  ""MAT"" not? \n  ""HAWTS"" not? \n  ""WARTS"" but R is absent? \n\n""HAZED"" has E and absent? \n So let\'s list: \n   BAITS: valid? \n   PASTS: valid? \n   MASTS: valid? \n   FASTS: F, A, S, T, S -> valid? \n   FASTS: yes? \n\nBut FASTS: position 1: F, position 5: S? And position 3: S? Duplicate? But we are testing S at 5? \n\nAlternatively, without S duplication: ""BAITS"" and ""MAITS"" not a word? ""GAITS""? \n  ""GAITS"": G A I T S -> that fits? \n  G at 1, A at 2, I at 3, T at 4, S at 5? \n  No duplication? \n  ""GAITS"" is a word: meaning a way of walking? \n\nSo ""GAITS"" is an option? \n\nSimilarly, ""RAITS""? R is absent? \n  ""WANTS"" but N absent? \n\n""GAITS"" is okay? \n\nSo we have candidates: \n  ""BAITS"" or ""GAITS""? \n\nEither: tests G or B? And I? \n\nWe’ve not tested B or G? \n\nWhich is more common? B is more common than G? \n\nBut we can choose BAITS? \n\nTo maximize information? \n\nI think ""BAITS"" is fine? \n\nSo I’ll guess ""BAITS"". \n\nFinal guess: ""BAITS""\n\n<guess>baits</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\nFrom previous feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C❌, R❌, A➖ (present, wrong position), N❌, E❌  \n  - **Key Takeaways**:  \n    - A is in the secret word, but not in position 3.  \n    - C, R, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: SALTY** → Feedback: S➖ (present, wrong position), A✅ (correct position), L❌, T✅ (correct position), Y❌  \n  - **Key Takeaways**:  \n    - A is in position 2.  \n    - T is in position 4.  \n    - S is present but not in position 1.  \n    - L and Y are **absent**.  \n    - Secret word format: `_ A _ T _` (positions 1, 3, and 5 unknown).  \n\n### Known Constraints:\n- **Confirmed Positions**:  \n  - Position 2: `A`  \n  - Position 4: `T`  \n- **Present Letter (Wrong Position)**:  \n  - `S` must be in position 3 or 5 (since it was ❌ in position 1 and positions 2/4 are fixed).  \n- **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E (from Guess 1), L, Y (from Guess 2).  \n- **New Letters to Test**: Focus on common unused letters (e.g., B, I, G, O, P, U) to maximize information while resolving `S`\'s position.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n1. **Test `S` Position**: Prioritize a guess where `S` is placed in position 5 (since position 3 is still viable). This reveals if `S` belongs at the end while testing new letters.  \n2. **Avoid Absent Letters**: Exclude C, E, L, N, R, Y.  \n3. **Maximize New Information**: Use high-frequency letters like B, I, or O (since vowels/diverse consonants narrow options faster).  \n4. **Valid Words**:  \n   - Ideal format: `[new] A [new] T S` (if `S` is guessed in position 5).  \n   - Example: **BAITS** (B✅/❔, I✅/❔, S➖/✅).  \n     - If `S` is ✅, it confirms position 5.  \n     - If `S` is ➖, `S` must be in position 3 (and position 5 becomes new unknown).  \n\n### Why ""BAITS""?\n- **Structure**: `B A I T S`  \n  - `A` position 2 (✅ confirmed), `T` position 4 (✅ confirmed).  \n  - **New Letters Tested**:  \n    - `B` (position 1): High-frequency consonant.  \n    - `I` (position 3): Common vowel.  \n    - `S` (position 5): Tests exact placement of known `S`.  \n- **Word Validity**: ""BAITS"" is a 5-letter English word.  \n- **Feedback Potential**: Resolves `S`\'s position and checks `B`/`I` for presence/absence in one guess.\n\n<guess>baits</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(✓) L(x) T(✓) Y(x)\nGuess 3: baits -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) I(x) T(✓) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  Meaning: 
    - A is present but not in position 3.
    - C, R, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""salty"" -> S(-), A(✓), L(x), T(✓), Y(x)
  Meaning:
    - A is correct at position 2.
    - T is correct at position 4.
    - S is present but not in position 1.
    - L and Y are absent.

Guess 3: ""baits"" -> B(x), A(✓), I(x), T(✓), S(-)
  Meaning:
    - A is correct at position 2 (already known).
    - T is correct at position 4 (already known).
    - B and I are absent.
    - S is present but not in position 5.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has the format: _ A _ T _
   - Position 2 is 'A'
   - Position 4 is 'T'

2. The letter S is present, but it is not in position 1 (from guess 2) and not in position 5 (from guess 3). Therefore, S must be in position 3.

   Why? Because the only positions left are 1, 3, and 5. We know S is not in 1 or 5, so it must be in 3.

3. Therefore, the secret word is: _ A S T _

   Now we only need to find the first letter (position 1) and the last letter (position 5). But note: we have already determined that S is in position 3, so the word is: [letter1] A S T [letter5]

4. Absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, Y, B, I.

   We must avoid these letters for positions 1 and 5.

5. We have tested the following letters that are present: A, T, S. We know A and T are fixed, and S is now fixed at position 3.

   So the only unknown letters are at positions 1 and 5.

6. We need to choose a word that fits the pattern: [letter1] A S T [letter5], with letter1 and letter5 being letters not in the absent list.

   The absent letters are: B, C, E, I, L, N, R, Y.

   Available letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

   But we should choose common letters.

7. We also note that we have not tested many vowels. The only vowel we know is A (and E, I are absent). The remaining vowels are O, U. We might want to test a vowel in one of the positions? But we don't have to.

8. We can try to form words with the pattern:

   Examples:
   - MAST? But that's 4 letters. We need 5: so MAST + one more letter? But we have two positions: first and last? Actually, the pattern is [1]A[3=S]T[5]. So the word is like XASTY? But Y is absent.

   Let's think of common words:

   - ""PASTY"": but Y is absent? And also, we have S at 3? But ""PASTY"" is P A S T Y -> positions: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). But Y is absent? So not allowed.

   - ""PASTE"": but E is absent? Not allowed.

   - ""HASTE"": E absent? Not allowed.

   - ""MASTS"": duplicate S? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, we have S at 3 and if we put S at 5? Then we have two S? But we know S is present? But we don't know if it appears twice? However, in our pattern, we have S at 3? And we are putting S at 5? That would be a different letter? But we are trying to find the letter at 5? 

   Actually, we are not forced to put S at 5? We are only putting S at 3? And we are looking for a word that has the pattern: [1] A S T [5]. So the letter at 5 is unknown? And we are not putting S at 5? Because we are using the pattern with S at 3? 

   But note: we are going to guess a word that has the form [1] A S T [5]. We are not putting S at 5? We are putting S at 3? And the letter at 5 is a new letter? 

   So we need to choose a word that has the form: [letter] A S T [letter]? 

   Examples of such words:

   - ""BASTS"": but B is absent? And duplicate S? 
   - ""FASTS"": F A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""GASTS"": G A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""HASTS"": H A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""MASTS"": M A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""PASTS"": P A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""VASTS"": V A S T S -> duplicate S? 

   But all these have duplicate S? And we don't know if the secret word has two S? 

   Alternatively, words without duplicate S? 

   - ""PASTA"": P A S T A -> but A is at 2 and 5? Duplicate A? And we know A is at 2? But we don't know if there is a second A? Also, in the first guess, we had A marked as present? But we only had one A? So it could be that there is a second A? 

   However, in ""PASTA"", we have A at 5? So if we guess ""PASTA"", then:

     Position 1: P -> new letter? 
     Position 2: A -> ✓
     Position 3: S -> ✓ (if we are correct that S is at 3? But we deduced it must be? So we expect ✓ for S at 3? 
     Position 4: T -> ✓
     Position 5: A -> ? 

   But if the secret word has only one A? Then the A at 5 would be marked absent? 

   But we know the secret word has at least one A? And we have it at 2? So if there is no second A? Then the A at 5 is absent? 

   However, we are not sure? 

   But note: we have a better option? 

   Another word: ""MASTO"" not a word? 

   ""PAST"" not 5 letters? 

   ""BASTE"" has E? 

   ""CASTS"" has C? 

   ""EASTS"" has E? 

   ""GASSY"" has Y? 

   ""HASPS"" has P? and S at 5? But we are putting S at 3? And then we have P at 5? 

   Actually, we can try ""HASPS"": H A S P S? But that has two S? And we are putting S at 3 and 5? 

   We need a word that has only one S? And the pattern? 

   How about ""PAST"" with a different last letter? 

   Let me think: 
     ""PAST"" is 4 letters? So we need 5: 
        ""PASTE"" -> E absent? 
        ""PASTA"" -> duplicate A? 
        ""PASTS"" -> duplicate S? 

   Another idea: ""MASTI"" not a word? 

   ""MASTOID"" is 6 letters? 

   ""MAST"" -> then add a letter? 

   Actually, we can use: ""MAS"" is not? 

   I think we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? 

   But let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and avoid absent letters? 

   Pattern: [1] A S T [5]

   With [1] and [5] being letters from: D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? 

   And the word must be English? 

   Possible words:

   - ""MASTS"": M A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""PASTS"": P A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""VASTS"": V A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""HASTS"": H A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""GASTS"": G A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""BASTS"": B is absent? 
   - ""EASTS"": E is absent? 
   - ""FASTS"": F A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""LASTS"": L is absent? 
   - ""PASTA"": P A S T A -> duplicate A? 
   - ""PASTE"": E absent? 
   - ""HASTE"": E absent? 
   - ""CASTS"": C absent? 
   - ""OASTS"": O A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""WASTS"": W A S T S -> duplicate S? 

   What about ""GASPS""? G A S P S -> duplicate S? And P? But pattern: G(1), A(2), S(3), P(4)? But we need T at 4? So not? 

   We must have T at 4? So the pattern is fixed: ...T at 4? 

   Another possibility: ""PAST"" is part of the word? 

   How about ""PAST"" with a letter before? Like ""UPAST""? Not a word? 

   Or ""REPAST""? But R and E absent? 

   I think we are missing: ""MASTY"" but Y absent? 

   Or ""PASTY"" Y absent? 

   So the only options seem to be words with duplicate S or duplicate A? 

   But we have one more option: ""HAST"" not 5 letters? 

   Wait, what about ""DASH"" not? 

   Let me search for words ending with T? But we have T at 4? So the last letter is after T? 

   Actually, the pattern is: [1] A S T [5] -> so the word is like XASTY? But Y absent? 

   Or XASTO? 

   ""PASTO"" not a word? 

   ""BASTO"" not? 

   ""GASTO"" not? 

   ""MASTO"" not? 

   ""VASTY"" not? 

   Another idea: ""TASTE""? But T at 1? And E? 

   T at 1? But we have T at 4? So duplicate T? 

   ""TASTE"": T A S T E -> positions: 
        1: T -> but we have T at 4? So duplicate T? 
        2: A -> ✓
        3: S -> ✓
        4: T -> ✓? 
        5: E -> absent? 

   But E is absent? 

   So not? 

   We are stuck? 

   But we must have missed some words? 

   Let me think: ""PAST"" is 4 letters? What 5-letter words have ""AST"" in the middle? 

   ""BASTION"" is 7 letters? 

   ""PASTURE"" is 7? 

   ""PLAST"" not? 

   ""BLAST"" is 5 letters: B L A S T -> but L is absent? 

   ""CAST"" -> C absent? 

   ""FAST"" -> F A S T? 4 letters? 

   ""GAST"" not? 

   ""HAST"" not? 

   ""LAST"" -> L absent? 

   ""MAST"" -> 4 letters? 

   ""OAST"" -> 4 letters? 

   ""PAST"" -> 4 letters? 

   ""RAST"" not? 

   ""WAST"" -> 4 letters? 

   So the only 5-letter words with ""AST"" in positions 2-4? And then a fifth letter? 

   Actually, we have the pattern: the first letter, then ""AST"", then the fifth letter? 

   So the word is: X + ""AST"" + Y? 

   And X and Y are single letters? 

   And the word must be valid? 

   Examples: 
     ""BASTS"" -> X=B, Y=S? 
     ""PASTA"" -> X=P, Y=A? 
     ""PASTE"" -> X=P, Y=E? 
     ""HASTY"" -> X=H, Y=Y? 
     etc.

   But we have constraints on X and Y: they must not be absent letters? 

   So from the list, we can have:

   - X = F, G, H, M, P, V, W? (from the list of available) and Y = S, A, E, Y? but E and Y are absent? And S and A are already present? 

   But we are forced to use one of the words? 

   Since we have to make a guess, let's choose ""PASTS"" or ""MASTS""? 

   But note: we have not tested P or M? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests new letters? 

   But we are at the fourth guess? We have 3 guesses left? 

   Let's choose ""MASTS"": M A S T S? 

   Why? 
     - M is a common letter? 
     - We test if there is a duplicate S? 

   If we guess ""MASTS"":
     - Position 1: M -> if M is in the word? 
     - Position 2: A ✓
     - Position 3: S -> we expect ✓ because we deduced S is at 3? 
     - Position 4: T ✓
     - Position 5: S -> if the secret word has two S? Then ✓? Otherwise, if only one S? Then ❌? 

   But we are not sure? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have duplicate letters? 

   But we don't have many options? 

   Another word: ""GASPS"" doesn't fit? 

   What about ""HASPS""? H A S P S? But then position 4 is P? But we need T at 4? 

   So no? 

   We must have T at 4? 

   Therefore, I think we have to go with one of the duplicate-S words? 

   Let's choose ""PASTS"": P A S T S? 

   But P is new? 

   Or ""MASTS"": M A S T S? 

   Or ""VASTS"": V is less common? 

   I'll go with ""MASTS"". 

   But note: we have not tested M? 

   If we guess ""MASTS"", and the secret word is ""MASTS"", then we win? 

   But if the secret word has only one S? Then we get feedback for S at 5 as absent? And then we know? 

   But also, we get feedback for M? 

   So let's do that. 

   Guess: ""MASTS""

   But wait, what if the secret word is ""PASTS""? Then we would have to try again? 

   But we have to start somewhere? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has a new letter at position 5? But we don't have any word without duplicate? 

   Another idea: what if the secret word has a letter at 5 that we haven't tried? And we use a word that has that letter? 

   But we don't know? 

   We can try ""MASTO"" not a word? 

   Or ""MASTI"" not? 

   I think we have to accept the duplicate and guess ""MASTS"". 

   But let me check: is there a word like ""PAST"" with a different last letter? 

   ""PASTD"" not? 

   ""PASTH"" not? 

   ""PASTW"" not? 

   So no? 

   Therefore, I choose ""MASTS"". 

   But note: we have a better option? 

   We know that the secret word has S at 3? So we can ignore the duplicate for now? And focus on position 1 and 5? 

   But we don't have a word that doesn't use S at 5? 

   Unless we use a word that has a different letter at 5? But then we are not testing S at 5? 

   But we already know S is not at 5? So we don't need to test it? 

   We can use a word that has the pattern: [1] A S T [5] with [5] being a new letter? 

   But as we saw, there are no common words without using duplicate or absent letters? 

   What about ""PAST"" with a letter that is not S or A? 

   For example, ""PASTU""? Not a word? 

   ""PASTO"" not? 

   ""PAST"" is 4 letters? 

   I think we have to use one of the words with duplicate? 

   Let's choose ""MASTS"". 

   But there's another word: ""BASTE"" is not allowed? 

   I recall: ""PAST"" can be extended? 

   ""PASTOR"" is 6 letters? 

   ""PASTED"" is 6? 

   So I think we are limited. 

   Let's try ""OASIS""? But that doesn't have T at 4? 

   No. 

   Therefore, I will guess ""MASTS"". 

   If the feedback shows S at 5 is absent? Then we know the secret word has only one S? And then we can try a word with a different letter at 5? 

   But we are at guess 4? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has a vowel at 5? 

   But we don't have a word? 

   Another idea: ""HAST"" is not? 

   I think we have to go with it. 

   Guess: ""MASTS""

   But let's see the feedback from guess 3: we have S at 5 marked as '-'? That means S is present but not at 5? So if the secret word had two S, then one of them would be at 5? But we got '-' for S at 5? That means that the secret word does not have a second S at 5? Or it has one S and it's at 3? 

   Actually, the feedback for ""baits"": S at 5 is marked as '-' -> this means that S is in the word but not at position 5. It doesn't say anything about how many S there are? But if there were two S, then one might be at 5? But then it would be marked as correct? 

   So if there were two S, then in ""baits"", we have S at 5? And if the secret has S at 5? Then it would be marked ✓? But it was marked '-'? So that means there is no S at 5? Therefore, the secret word has exactly one S? And it is at position 3? 

   So we don't need to test for duplicate S? 

   Therefore, the secret word has only one S? And it is at position 3? 

   So the word is: [1] A S T [5]? And [5] is not S? 

   And [1] is not S? 

   And we need a letter for [1] and [5] that are not in the absent list? 

   But we have no common words? 

   What about ""PASTA""? P A S T A? 

   Then [1]=P, [5]=A? 

   But A is already at 2? So duplicate A? 

   And we don't know if there is a second A? 

   In the first guess, we had only one A marked? But that doesn't preclude a second A? 

   So ""PASTA"" is a possibility? 

   Similarly, ""PASTE"" is not? 

   ""HASTA""? H A S T A? 

   ""HASTA"" is a word? From Spanish? But used in English? 

   Or ""MASTA"" not a word? 

   ""VASTA"" not? 

   ""BASTA"" is a word? Meaning ""enough"" in Italian? But used in English? 

   But let's check: 
     ""BASTA"": B is absent? 

   ""PASTA"" is the most common? 

   And P is not absent? 

   So let's try ""PASTA"": 

     Position 1: P -> if present? 
     Position 2: A ✓
     Position 3: S ✓ (since we know S is at 3)
     Position 4: T ✓
     Position 5: A -> if the secret word has a second A? Then ✓? Or if not? Then ❌? 

   But if the secret word is ""PASTA"", then we win? 

   If not? Then we get feedback on P and the second A? 

   But we have only two guesses left? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has two new letters? 

   But we don't have such a word? 

   I think ""PASTA"" is a good try? 

   Or ""HASTA""? H is not absent? 

   Let's choose ""PASTA"". 

   Guess: ""PASTA""

   But note: in the first guess, we had A marked as present but not at position 3? And now we are putting A at 5? So if there is a second A? It's okay? 

   We'll see. 

   I'll go with ""PASTA"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: CRANE**  
   - C❌, R❌, A➖ (present, wrong position), N❌, E❌  
   - **Key Insights**:  
     - `A` is in the secret word but **not in position 3**.  
     - `C`, `R`, `N`, `E` are **absent**.  

2. **Guess 2: SALTY**  
   - S➖ (present, wrong position), A✅ (position 2), L❌, T✅ (position 4), Y❌  
   - **Key Insights**:  
     - `A` is **fixed at position 2**.  
     - `T` is **fixed at position 4**.  
     - `S` is present but **not in position 1**.  
     - `L`, `Y` are **absent**.  
     - Secret word format: `_ A _ T _`.  

3. **Guess 3: BAITS**  
   - B❌, A✅ (position 2), I❌, T✅ (position 4), S➖ (present, wrong position)  
   - **Key Insights**:  
     - `B`, `I` are **absent**.  
     - `S` is present but **not in position 5**.  
     - Since `S` is absent from positions 1 (Guess 2) and 5 (Guess 3), it **must be in position 3**.  
     - Secret word format: `[letter] A S T [letter]`.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Fixed Letters**:  
  - Position 2: `A`  
  - Position 3: `S` (deduced)  
  - Position 4: `T`  
- **Absent Letters**: `B`, `C`, `E`, `I`, `L`, `N`, `R`, `Y`.  
- **Unknown Positions**:  
  - Position 1: Must be a letter **not absent** (e.g., `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `K`, `M`, `O`, `P`, `U`, `W`).  
  - Position 5: Must be a letter **not absent** and **not `S`** (since `S` is confirmed at position 3).  
- **Possible Words**:  
  - The secret word is `[1] A S T [5]` (e.g., `PASTA`, `HASTA`, `MASTS`).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test Position 1 and 5**: Prioritize a word that uses common unused letters to resolve both unknowns.  
- **Avoid Absent Letters**: Exclude `B`, `C`, `E`, `I`, `L`, `N`, `R`, `Y`.  
- **Optimal Word Choice**:  
  - **PASTA** (`P A S T A`):  
    - Tests `P` (position 1) and `A` (position 5).  
    - `A` at position 5 tests for a **potential duplicate `A`** (not ruled out by prior feedback).  
    - High-information potential:  
      - If `P` is ✅, it confirms position 1.  
      - If `A` at position 5 is ✅, it confirms a duplicate `A`; if ❌, `A` is only at position 2.  

### Why ""PASTA""?
- **Fits Deduced Pattern**: Matches `[1] A S T [5]`.  
- **Tests Critical Unknowns**:  
  - `P` (position 1): Common consonant.  
  - `A` (position 5): Tests for duplicate vowel.  
- **Eliminates Possibilities**: Resolves the secret word if it is `PASTA` or narrows options significantly if not.  

<guess>pasta</guess>",pasta,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  Meaning: 
    - A is present but not in position 3.
    - C, R, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""salty"" -> S(-), A(✓), L(x), T(✓), Y(x)
  Meaning:
    - A is correct at position 2.
    - T is correct at position 4.
    - S is present but not in position 1.
    - L and Y are absent.

Guess 3: ""baits"" -> B(x), A(✓), I(x), T(✓), S(-)
  Meaning:
    - A is correct at position 2 (already known).
    - T is correct at position 4 (already known).
    - B and I are absent.
    - S is present but not in position 5.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has the format: _ A _ T _
   - Position 2 is 'A'
   - Position 4 is 'T'

2. The letter S is present, but it is not in position 1 (from guess 2) and not in position 5 (from guess 3). Therefore, S must be in position 3.

   Why? Because the only positions left are 1, 3, and 5. We know S is not in 1 or 5, so it must be in 3.

3. Therefore, the secret word is: _ A S T _

   Now we only need to find the first letter (position 1) and the last letter (position 5). But note: we have already determined that S is in position 3, so the word is: [letter1] A S T [letter5]

4. Absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, Y, B, I.

   We must avoid these letters for positions 1 and 5.

5. We have tested the following letters that are present: A, T, S. We know A and T are fixed, and S is now fixed at position 3.

   So the only unknown letters are at positions 1 and 5.

6. We need to choose a word that fits the pattern: [letter1] A S T [letter5], with letter1 and letter5 being letters not in the absent list.

   The absent letters are: B, C, E, I, L, N, R, Y.

   Available letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

   But we should choose common letters.

7. We also note that we have not tested many vowels. The only vowel we know is A (and E, I are absent). The remaining vowels are O, U. We might want to test a vowel in one of the positions? But we don't have to.

8. We can try to form words with the pattern:

   Examples:
   - MAST? But that's 4 letters. We need 5: so MAST + one more letter? But we have two positions: first and last? Actually, the pattern is [1]A[3=S]T[5]. So the word is like XASTY? But Y is absent.

   Let's think of common words:

   - ""PASTY"": but Y is absent? And also, we have S at 3? But ""PASTY"" is P A S T Y -> positions: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). But Y is absent? So not allowed.

   - ""PASTE"": but E is absent? Not allowed.

   - ""HASTE"": E absent? Not allowed.

   - ""MASTS"": duplicate S? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, we have S at 3 and if we put S at 5? Then we have two S? But we know S is present? But we don't know if it appears twice? However, in our pattern, we have S at 3? And we are putting S at 5? That would be a different letter? But we are trying to find the letter at 5? 

   Actually, we are not forced to put S at 5? We are only putting S at 3? And we are looking for a word that has the pattern: [1] A S T [5]. So the letter at 5 is unknown? And we are not putting S at 5? Because we are using the pattern with S at 3? 

   But note: we are going to guess a word that has the form [1] A S T [5]. We are not putting S at 5? We are putting S at 3? And the letter at 5 is a new letter? 

   So we need to choose a word that has the form: [letter] A S T [letter]? 

   Examples of such words:

   - ""BASTS"": but B is absent? And duplicate S? 
   - ""FASTS"": F A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""GASTS"": G A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""HASTS"": H A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""MASTS"": M A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""PASTS"": P A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""VASTS"": V A S T S -> duplicate S? 

   But all these have duplicate S? And we don't know if the secret word has two S? 

   Alternatively, words without duplicate S? 

   - ""PASTA"": P A S T A -> but A is at 2 and 5? Duplicate A? And we know A is at 2? But we don't know if there is a second A? Also, in the first guess, we had A marked as present? But we only had one A? So it could be that there is a second A? 

   However, in ""PASTA"", we have A at 5? So if we guess ""PASTA"", then:

     Position 1: P -> new letter? 
     Position 2: A -> ✓
     Position 3: S -> ✓ (if we are correct that S is at 3? But we deduced it must be? So we expect ✓ for S at 3? 
     Position 4: T -> ✓
     Position 5: A -> ? 

   But if the secret word has only one A? Then the A at 5 would be marked absent? 

   But we know the secret word has at least one A? And we have it at 2? So if there is no second A? Then the A at 5 is absent? 

   However, we are not sure? 

   But note: we have a better option? 

   Another word: ""MASTO"" not a word? 

   ""PAST"" not 5 letters? 

   ""BASTE"" has E? 

   ""CASTS"" has C? 

   ""EASTS"" has E? 

   ""GASSY"" has Y? 

   ""HASPS"" has P? and S at 5? But we are putting S at 3? And then we have P at 5? 

   Actually, we can try ""HASPS"": H A S P S? But that has two S? And we are putting S at 3 and 5? 

   We need a word that has only one S? And the pattern? 

   How about ""PAST"" with a different last letter? 

   Let me think: 
     ""PAST"" is 4 letters? So we need 5: 
        ""PASTE"" -> E absent? 
        ""PASTA"" -> duplicate A? 
        ""PASTS"" -> duplicate S? 

   Another idea: ""MASTI"" not a word? 

   ""MASTOID"" is 6 letters? 

   ""MAST"" -> then add a letter? 

   Actually, we can use: ""MAS"" is not? 

   I think we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? 

   But let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and avoid absent letters? 

   Pattern: [1] A S T [5]

   With [1] and [5] being letters from: D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? 

   And the word must be English? 

   Possible words:

   - ""MASTS"": M A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""PASTS"": P A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""VASTS"": V A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""HASTS"": H A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""GASTS"": G A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""BASTS"": B is absent? 
   - ""EASTS"": E is absent? 
   - ""FASTS"": F A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""LASTS"": L is absent? 
   - ""PASTA"": P A S T A -> duplicate A? 
   - ""PASTE"": E absent? 
   - ""HASTE"": E absent? 
   - ""CASTS"": C absent? 
   - ""OASTS"": O A S T S -> duplicate S? 
   - ""WASTS"": W A S T S -> duplicate S? 

   What about ""GASPS""? G A S P S -> duplicate S? And P? But pattern: G(1), A(2), S(3), P(4)? But we need T at 4? So not? 

   We must have T at 4? So the pattern is fixed: ...T at 4? 

   Another possibility: ""PAST"" is part of the word? 

   How about ""PAST"" with a letter before? Like ""UPAST""? Not a word? 

   Or ""REPAST""? But R and E absent? 

   I think we are missing: ""MASTY"" but Y absent? 

   Or ""PASTY"" Y absent? 

   So the only options seem to be words with duplicate S or duplicate A? 

   But we have one more option: ""HAST"" not 5 letters? 

   Wait, what about ""DASH"" not? 

   Let me search for words ending with T? But we have T at 4? So the last letter is after T? 

   Actually, the pattern is: [1] A S T [5] -> so the word is like XASTY? But Y absent? 

   Or XASTO? 

   ""PASTO"" not a word? 

   ""BASTO"" not? 

   ""GASTO"" not? 

   ""MASTO"" not? 

   ""VASTY"" not? 

   Another idea: ""TASTE""? But T at 1? And E? 

   T at 1? But we have T at 4? So duplicate T? 

   ""TASTE"": T A S T E -> positions: 
        1: T -> but we have T at 4? So duplicate T? 
        2: A -> ✓
        3: S -> ✓
        4: T -> ✓? 
        5: E -> absent? 

   But E is absent? 

   So not? 

   We are stuck? 

   But we must have missed some words? 

   Let me think: ""PAST"" is 4 letters? What 5-letter words have ""AST"" in the middle? 

   ""BASTION"" is 7 letters? 

   ""PASTURE"" is 7? 

   ""PLAST"" not? 

   ""BLAST"" is 5 letters: B L A S T -> but L is absent? 

   ""CAST"" -> C absent? 

   ""FAST"" -> F A S T? 4 letters? 

   ""GAST"" not? 

   ""HAST"" not? 

   ""LAST"" -> L absent? 

   ""MAST"" -> 4 letters? 

   ""OAST"" -> 4 letters? 

   ""PAST"" -> 4 letters? 

   ""RAST"" not? 

   ""WAST"" -> 4 letters? 

   So the only 5-letter words with ""AST"" in positions 2-4? And then a fifth letter? 

   Actually, we have the pattern: the first letter, then ""AST"", then the fifth letter? 

   So the word is: X + ""AST"" + Y? 

   And X and Y are single letters? 

   And the word must be valid? 

   Examples: 
     ""BASTS"" -> X=B, Y=S? 
     ""PASTA"" -> X=P, Y=A? 
     ""PASTE"" -> X=P, Y=E? 
     ""HASTY"" -> X=H, Y=Y? 
     etc.

   But we have constraints on X and Y: they must not be absent letters? 

   So from the list, we can have:

   - X = F, G, H, M, P, V, W? (from the list of available) and Y = S, A, E, Y? but E and Y are absent? And S and A are already present? 

   But we are forced to use one of the words? 

   Since we have to make a guess, let's choose ""PASTS"" or ""MASTS""? 

   But note: we have not tested P or M? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests new letters? 

   But we are at the fourth guess? We have 3 guesses left? 

   Let's choose ""MASTS"": M A S T S? 

   Why? 
     - M is a common letter? 
     - We test if there is a duplicate S? 

   If we guess ""MASTS"":
     - Position 1: M -> if M is in the word? 
     - Position 2: A ✓
     - Position 3: S -> we expect ✓ because we deduced S is at 3? 
     - Position 4: T ✓
     - Position 5: S -> if the secret word has two S? Then ✓? Otherwise, if only one S? Then ❌? 

   But we are not sure? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have duplicate letters? 

   But we don't have many options? 

   Another word: ""GASPS"" doesn't fit? 

   What about ""HASPS""? H A S P S? But then position 4 is P? But we need T at 4? 

   So no? 

   We must have T at 4? 

   Therefore, I think we have to go with one of the duplicate-S words? 

   Let's choose ""PASTS"": P A S T S? 

   But P is new? 

   Or ""MASTS"": M A S T S? 

   Or ""VASTS"": V is less common? 

   I'll go with ""MASTS"". 

   But note: we have not tested M? 

   If we guess ""MASTS"", and the secret word is ""MASTS"", then we win? 

   But if the secret word has only one S? Then we get feedback for S at 5 as absent? And then we know? 

   But also, we get feedback for M? 

   So let's do that. 

   Guess: ""MASTS""

   But wait, what if the secret word is ""PASTS""? Then we would have to try again? 

   But we have to start somewhere? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has a new letter at position 5? But we don't have any word without duplicate? 

   Another idea: what if the secret word has a letter at 5 that we haven't tried? And we use a word that has that letter? 

   But we don't know? 

   We can try ""MASTO"" not a word? 

   Or ""MASTI"" not? 

   I think we have to accept the duplicate and guess ""MASTS"". 

   But let me check: is there a word like ""PAST"" with a different last letter? 

   ""PASTD"" not? 

   ""PASTH"" not? 

   ""PASTW"" not? 

   So no? 

   Therefore, I choose ""MASTS"". 

   But note: we have a better option? 

   We know that the secret word has S at 3? So we can ignore the duplicate for now? And focus on position 1 and 5? 

   But we don't have a word that doesn't use S at 5? 

   Unless we use a word that has a different letter at 5? But then we are not testing S at 5? 

   But we already know S is not at 5? So we don't need to test it? 

   We can use a word that has the pattern: [1] A S T [5] with [5] being a new letter? 

   But as we saw, there are no common words without using duplicate or absent letters? 

   What about ""PAST"" with a letter that is not S or A? 

   For example, ""PASTU""? Not a word? 

   ""PASTO"" not? 

   ""PAST"" is 4 letters? 

   I think we have to use one of the words with duplicate? 

   Let's choose ""MASTS"". 

   But there's another word: ""BASTE"" is not allowed? 

   I recall: ""PAST"" can be extended? 

   ""PASTOR"" is 6 letters? 

   ""PASTED"" is 6? 

   So I think we are limited. 

   Let's try ""OASIS""? But that doesn't have T at 4? 

   No. 

   Therefore, I will guess ""MASTS"". 

   If the feedback shows S at 5 is absent? Then we know the secret word has only one S? And then we can try a word with a different letter at 5? 

   But we are at guess 4? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has a vowel at 5? 

   But we don't have a word? 

   Another idea: ""HAST"" is not? 

   I think we have to go with it. 

   Guess: ""MASTS""

   But let's see the feedback from guess 3: we have S at 5 marked as '-'? That means S is present but not at 5? So if the secret word had two S, then one of them would be at 5? But we got '-' for S at 5? That means that the secret word does not have a second S at 5? Or it has one S and it's at 3? 

   Actually, the feedback for ""baits"": S at 5 is marked as '-' -> this means that S is in the word but not at position 5. It doesn't say anything about how many S there are? But if there were two S, then one might be at 5? But then it would be marked as correct? 

   So if there were two S, then in ""baits"", we have S at 5? And if the secret has S at 5? Then it would be marked ✓? But it was marked '-'? So that means there is no S at 5? Therefore, the secret word has exactly one S? And it is at position 3? 

   So we don't need to test for duplicate S? 

   Therefore, the secret word has only one S? And it is at position 3? 

   So the word is: [1] A S T [5]? And [5] is not S? 

   And [1] is not S? 

   And we need a letter for [1] and [5] that are not in the absent list? 

   But we have no common words? 

   What about ""PASTA""? P A S T A? 

   Then [1]=P, [5]=A? 

   But A is already at 2? So duplicate A? 

   And we don't know if there is a second A? 

   In the first guess, we had only one A marked? But that doesn't preclude a second A? 

   So ""PASTA"" is a possibility? 

   Similarly, ""PASTE"" is not? 

   ""HASTA""? H A S T A? 

   ""HASTA"" is a word? From Spanish? But used in English? 

   Or ""MASTA"" not a word? 

   ""VASTA"" not? 

   ""BASTA"" is a word? Meaning ""enough"" in Italian? But used in English? 

   But let's check: 
     ""BASTA"": B is absent? 

   ""PASTA"" is the most common? 

   And P is not absent? 

   So let's try ""PASTA"": 

     Position 1: P -> if present? 
     Position 2: A ✓
     Position 3: S ✓ (since we know S is at 3)
     Position 4: T ✓
     Position 5: A -> if the secret word has a second A? Then ✓? Or if not? Then ❌? 

   But if the secret word is ""PASTA"", then we win? 

   If not? Then we get feedback on P and the second A? 

   But we have only two guesses left? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has two new letters? 

   But we don't have such a word? 

   I think ""PASTA"" is a good try? 

   Or ""HASTA""? H is not absent? 

   Let's choose ""PASTA"". 

   Guess: ""PASTA""

   But note: in the first guess, we had A marked as present but not at position 3? And now we are putting A at 5? So if there is a second A? It's okay? 

   We'll see. 

   I'll go with ""PASTA"". 

   <guess>pasta</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: CRANE**  
   - C❌, R❌, A➖ (present, wrong position), N❌, E❌  
   - **Key Insights**:  
     - `A` is in the secret word but **not in position 3**.  
     - `C`, `R`, `N`, `E` are **absent**.  

2. **Guess 2: SALTY**  
   - S➖ (present, wrong position), A✅ (position 2), L❌, T✅ (position 4), Y❌  
   - **Key Insights**:  
     - `A` is **fixed at position 2**.  
     - `T` is **fixed at position 4**.  
     - `S` is present but **not in position 1**.  
     - `L`, `Y` are **absent**.  
     - Secret word format: `_ A _ T _`.  

3. **Guess 3: BAITS**  
   - B❌, A✅ (position 2), I❌, T✅ (position 4), S➖ (present, wrong position)  
   - **Key Insights**:  
     - `B`, `I` are **absent**.  
     - `S` is present but **not in position 5**.  
     - Since `S` is absent from positions 1 (Guess 2) and 5 (Guess 3), it **must be in position 3**.  
     - Secret word format: `[letter] A S T [letter]`.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Fixed Letters**:  
  - Position 2: `A`  
  - Position 3: `S` (deduced)  
  - Position 4: `T`  
- **Absent Letters**: `B`, `C`, `E`, `I`, `L`, `N`, `R`, `Y`.  
- **Unknown Positions**:  
  - Position 1: Must be a letter **not absent** (e.g., `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `K`, `M`, `O`, `P`, `U`, `W`).  
  - Position 5: Must be a letter **not absent** and **not `S`** (since `S` is confirmed at position 3).  
- **Possible Words**:  
  - The secret word is `[1] A S T [5]` (e.g., `PASTA`, `HASTA`, `MASTS`).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test Position 1 and 5**: Prioritize a word that uses common unused letters to resolve both unknowns.  
- **Avoid Absent Letters**: Exclude `B`, `C`, `E`, `I`, `L`, `N`, `R`, `Y`.  
- **Optimal Word Choice**:  
  - **PASTA** (`P A S T A`):  
    - Tests `P` (position 1) and `A` (position 5).  
    - `A` at position 5 tests for a **potential duplicate `A`** (not ruled out by prior feedback).  
    - High-information potential:  
      - If `P` is ✅, it confirms position 1.  
      - If `A` at position 5 is ✅, it confirms a duplicate `A`; if ❌, `A` is only at position 2.  

### Why ""PASTA""?
- **Fits Deduced Pattern**: Matches `[1] A S T [5]`.  
- **Tests Critical Unknowns**:  
  - `P` (position 1): Common consonant.  
  - `A` (position 5): Tests for duplicate vowel.  
- **Eliminates Possibilities**: Resolves the secret word if it is `PASTA` or narrows options significantly if not.",Guess 4: pasta -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
