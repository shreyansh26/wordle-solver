We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
- R: x (R is not in the secret word)
- A: ✓ (A is in the secret word and in the correct position, which is the third position since A is the third letter in ""crane"")
- N: x (N is not in the secret word)
- E: x (E is not in the secret word)

So, from the feedback we know:
1. The letter A is in the secret word and it is in the third position (so the secret word has the form: _ _ A _ _).
2. The letter C is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since in ""crane"" it was first and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced). Also, note that since A is in the third position, C must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5? But wait, it was in position 1 and got a '-', so it cannot be in position 1. Therefore, C must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
3. The letters R, N, and E are not in the secret word.

We also know that the secret word does not contain R, N, E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has A in the third position (to keep that fixed and get more information).
- Includes the letter C in a position that we haven't tried (so not in position 1, but we can try position 2, 4, or 5).
- Avoids the letters R, N, E.

Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have the form: _ _ A _ _

And that include the letter C (but not in the first position) and avoid R, N, E.

Possible positions for C: we can try putting C in the second position? Or the fourth? Or the fifth?

We also want to introduce new common letters to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

Common consonants besides C (which we know is in the word) are: T, S, L, etc. Vowels: we know A is fixed, and we might try O or I.

But note: we don't know if there are other vowels.

Let me try to list some words that fit the pattern:

- The word must have A in the third position and contain C (but not in the first position) and without R, N, E.

Possible words:

- If we put C in the second position: then the word is _ C A _ _

Examples: SCAL? (but S is a new letter, and L is new) -> but we don't know if S or L are in the word. Also, we must avoid R, N, E.

But note: we have to make a valid English word.

Let me think of words: 
- SCAL? Not a word. 
- SCAB? That's a word: SCAB -> S C A B. 
  - But we have to check: S (new), C (we know is in the word, but we are putting it in second position), A (fixed in third), B (new). 
  - This avoids R, N, E.

But is SCAB a valid word? Yes, meaning a crust over a wound.

Alternatively, we could put C in the fourth position: _ _ A C _

Examples: 
- PLACE? But we know E is not in the word (from previous feedback) so we cannot use E. 
- TRACK? But T is new, and we know R is not in the word (so we cannot use R). 
- BLACK? But B, L, K are new, and we avoid R, N, E. But note: we don't know about B, L, K.

But wait, we must avoid R, so TRACK is invalid because of R. 

Another example: CLAMP? But M and P are new, and we avoid R, N, E. But CLAMP has C in the first position? We cannot put C in the first position because we know from feedback that C is not in the first position (it was in the first in ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but not in that position). So we cannot use C in the first position.

Therefore, for the fourth position: _ _ A C _

We need a word that has two letters before A, then C in the fourth, and then one more. And without R, N, E.

What about: 
- SHACK? S H A C K -> avoids R, N, E. 
- Or STACK? But T is new, but we cannot use R? STACK has no R? Wait, STACK: S, T, A, C, K -> no R, no N, no E. So that's valid.

But note: we know that R is not in the word, so STACK is acceptable? But we don't know about S, T, K.

Alternatively, we could put C in the fifth position: _ _ A _ C

Examples: 
- TRAC? -> but we need five letters. 
- PLAC? -> not a word. 
- Maybe ""MANIC"" but we know N is not in the word (from feedback: N was in ""crane"" and got x) and also M is new. But we cannot use N. 
- ""MAGIC"" -> M A G I C -> but wait, A is in the second position? We need A in the third. So not.

We need A in the third. So for the fifth position: the word would be _ _ A ? C

Examples: 
- ""CHAOS"" -> but that has A in the third? C H A O S -> yes, A is third. But we have C in the first position? We cannot put C in the first because we know it's not the first. 
- ""SHALT"" -> but no C. 
- ""FACET"" -> but E is not allowed. 

It's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, we can try to put C in the second position: so the pattern is _ C A _ _

We already thought of ""SCAB"". Another one: ""SCALP"" but we know L is new, and P is new, but also we avoid R, N, E. But ""SCALP"" has L and P. 

But note: we don't know if L or P are in the word. We are trying to get information.

Another word: ""SCAMP"" -> S C A M P. This avoids R, N, E.

But let me compare:

Option 1: SCAB (S, C, A, B) -> we test S and B.
Option 2: SHACK (S, H, A, C, K) -> we test S, H, C, K. But note C is in the fourth position? In SHACK: positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:C, 5:K -> so C is in the fourth.

We want to test C in a new position. Since in the first guess C was in position 1, we can try position 2, 4, or 5.

I think it's a good idea to try C in a different position to see where it might be.

But also, we know that the secret word has A in the third position and C somewhere else (not first, not third because A is there). So the possible positions for C are 2, 4, or 5.

We can try to put C in the second position in this guess.

So, let's choose a word with the pattern: _ C A _ _

We have:
- SCAB: S C A B -> tests S (position 1), C (position 2), A (position 3), B (position 4). 
- SCAM: S C A M -> but that's only 4 letters? No, SCAM is 4 letters. 
- SCALP: 5 letters? S C A L P -> but that's 5: S, C, A, L, P. 
- SCAMP: S C A M P -> 5 letters.

But we must avoid R, N, E. Both SCAB and SCAMP are valid.

Another one: ""SCARF"" but we know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R.

So, SCAB or SCAMP.

We can also consider: ""OCEAN"" but we know E is not allowed and O is new? But OCEAN has E and N, which are both excluded. So no.

Another: ""LOCAL"" -> L O C A L -> but A is in the fourth position? We need A in the third. So no.

So, let's stick with SCAB or SCAMP.

I think SCAB is a good choice because it has fewer letters and we get to test B. But both are valid.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has more common letters. For example, we might want to test T or S or L.

But note: we haven't tested S yet. So including S is good.

Another word: ""SPACE"" -> but E is excluded. 

""CLASP"" -> but C is in the first position? We cannot use C in the first.

So, back to SCAB or SCAMP.

I think I'll go with SCAB because it's shorter and common? But both are 5 letters.

But let me think: we want to maximize the information. SCAB uses the letters S, C, A, B. We already know A and C are in the word. So we are testing S and B.

SCAMP uses S, C, A, M, P. We are testing S, M, P.

Since we have more unknowns, testing more new letters might be better? But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Alternatively, we can try to include T. How about a word with T?

For example, putting C in the fourth position: _ _ A C _

We can have: ""ATTIC"" -> A T T I C -> but A is in the first position? We need A in the third. So no.

""STACK"": S T A C K -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:C, 5:K -> that works. And it avoids R, N, E.

STACK: 
- S is new (position 1)
- T is new (position 2)
- A is fixed (position 3)
- C is in position 4 (which is a new position for C, not tried before)
- K is new (position 5)

This tests three new letters: S, T, K and also tests C in the fourth position.

This might be better because we are testing more new letters.

Similarly, we could do ""SHACK"": S H A C K -> tests S, H, K.

But STACK tests T as well, which is a very common letter.

So, STACK seems a good choice.

But wait, is STACK a valid word? Yes.

So, I think I'll go with ""STACK"".

But let me confirm: the secret word has A in the third position and C is in the word (but not in first). STACK has A in third and C in fourth. And we avoid R, N, E.

So, our second guess: STACK.

We'll get feedback on S, T, A, C, K.

If we get a ✓ for A, that's expected. And we'll see about the others.

This might help us narrow down the possibilities.

So, the guess is ""stack"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in the first position (since it received ""-"").
- A is in the secret word and in the correct third position (since it received ""✓"").
- R, N, and E are not in the secret word (since they received ""x"").

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Keep A in the third position.
2. Include C in a position other than the first (to test its possible locations: second, fourth, or fifth).
3. Avoid using R, N, or E.
4. Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""stack"" because:
- It has A in the third position.
- It places C in the fourth position (a new position to test).
- It avoids R, N, and E.
- It introduces three new common letters: S, T, and K, which can provide valuable feedback.
