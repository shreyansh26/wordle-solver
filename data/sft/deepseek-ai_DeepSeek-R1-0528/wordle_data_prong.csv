We are making our first guess. Since there's no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 Common strategies include choosing words with common letters and avoiding repeated letters to cover more possibilities.
 Some good starting words are like ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has:
   - Common vowels: A, E
   - Common consonants: R, T, S, etc.

 I'll go with ""CRATE"". It has C, R, A, T, E.

For the first guess, I need to select a word that maximizes information gathering. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to test which letters appear in the secret word. The word should avoid repeated letters to cover more possibilities. 

I'll choose **""CRATE""** because:
- It contains common vowels: A and E.

Based on the feedback from Guess 1: ""crate"" → C(x), R(✓), A(x), T(x), E(x)

We know:
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
- C, A, T, E are not in the secret word at all.

So the secret word has 'R' as the second letter.

The letters C, A, T, E are eliminated. So we must avoid words containing these letters.

Now, for the next guess:
- We need to keep 'R' in the second position.
- The other four positions should be filled with letters not in the excluded set (C, A, T, E) and preferably new common letters to gather more information.

Possible common consonants left: S, L, N, B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc. (avoiding C,A,T,E)

Good strategy: Pick a word that has:
  - 'R' fixed in position 2.
  - Other positions: Use new high-frequency letters.

Example options:
- Position 1: try S, B, F, etc.
- Position 3: try I, O, U (vowels) or common consonants.
- Position 4 and 5: similar.

But we know A is out, so vowels to consider: I, O, U (since E is also out).

Let me think of a word that fits:
- Must have R in second place: _ R _ _ _

Words: BRING, BRISK, BRINK, PROUD, FRUIT, etc. But we need to avoid C,A,T,E.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Consider ""PRISM"":
- P, R, I, S, M → R is fixed at position 2. P, I, S, M are all new and not excluded.

But let me check if PRISM is allowed: yes.

Another: ""BRISK"" – B, R, I, S, K – also good.

But ""PRISM"" uses P,R,I,S,M – five letters not previously tried.

Since R is confirmed, we can try words with R in the second position and other common letters.

What about words that include other vowels? We know E and A are out, so the vowels must be I, O, U, or sometimes Y.

""SPRIG"": S, P, R, I, G – all new letters? S,P,I,G haven't been tested.

But I see that in ""crate"", we tried C,R,A,T,E – so S,P,I,G are fresh.

Also, ""BROWN"": B,R,O,W,N – O and W,N are new.

But we might want to cover more vowels. Since A and E are out, maybe test O or U or I.

I think ""PRISM"" is a strong choice because:
- It has P, I, S, M all new.
- It tests I as a vowel.

Another classic post-start word: after CRATE, with R fixed, words like ""PURRS"" but PURRS has double R, which might not be efficient since if R is already known, duplicates don't help much. Better distinct letters.

""ORRIS"" but that's obscure; PRISM is better.

What about ""RISKY""? R is the first letter, but in our case R must be second position. ""RISKY"" has R first, which won't work because we need position 2.

We must have a word with second letter R.

So viable words: 
- PRISM (P R I S M)
- BRINK (B R I N K)
- BRISK (B R I S K)
- DRINK - but D is untested, but Drink contains D,N,K – but also I? R in second.

DRINK: D,R,I,N,K – all avoid C,A,T,E.

We have to consider frequency: S, N, L are common, so including them helps.

Since we only have one correct letter so far, and four to guess, we need to test new letters.

I'll go with ""PRISM"".

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. R is confirmed at position 2.
2. C, A, T, E are excluded.
3. Next guess must include R in position 2.
4. Avoid letters: C, A, T, E.
5. Choose a word with four new letters in other positions to gather information.
6. PRISM: P (new), R (fixed correct), I (new), S (new), M (new). This tests I as a vowel and S, P, M which are common.

Therefore, I'll guess ""PRISM"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crate""):
- R is correct and in position 2.
- C, A, T, and E are not in the secret word at all.

For the next guess:
- Must have R in position 2.
- Avoid letters C, A, T, E.
- Use new, common letters to test other positions efficiently.

I chose **""PRISM""** because:
- It keeps R in position 2.
- It introduces four new letters (P, I, S, M), which are high-frequency and can help gather information quickly.
- P, I, S, M cover a mix of consonants and vowels (I is a vowel) not yet tested.

<thinking>
**Reasoning Summary:**
1. **Position 2 is fixed:** R must remain in the second slot due to the ✓ feedback.
2. **Excluded letters:** C, A, T, E must not appear in the new guess.
3. **New letter testing:** PRISM introduces P (position 1), I (position 3), S (position 4), and M (position 5)—all unconfirmed and covering a broad range of possibilities.
4. **Word validity:** ""PRISM"" is a valid English 5-letter word.

So we must avoid words containing these letters.\n\nNow, for the next guess:\n- We need to keep \'R\' in the second position.\n- The other four positions should be filled with letters not in the excluded set (C, A, T, E) and preferably new common letters to gather more information.\n\nPossible common consonants left: S, L, N, B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc. (avoiding C,A,T,E)\n\nGood strategy: Pick a word that has:\n  - \'R\' fixed in position 2.\n  - Other positions: Use new high-frequency letters.\n\nExample options:\n- Position 1: try S, B, F, etc.\n- Position 3: try I, O, U (vowels) or common consonants.\n- Position 4 and 5: similar.\n\nBut we know A is out, so vowels to consider: I, O, U (since E is also out).\n\nLet me think of a word that fits:\n- Must have R in second place: _ R _ _ _\n\nWords: BRING, BRISK, BRINK, PROUD, FRUIT, etc. But we need to avoid C,A,T,E.\n\nAlso, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nConsider ""PRISM"":\n- P, R, I, S, M → R is fixed at position 2.

Since A and E are out, maybe test O or U or I.\n\nI think ""PRISM"" is a strong choice because:\n- It has P, I, S, M all new.\n- It tests I as a vowel.\n\nAnother classic post-start word: after CRATE, with R fixed, words like ""PURRS"" but PURRS has double R, which might not be efficient since if R is already known, duplicates don\'t help much.

Choose a word with four new letters in other positions to gather information.\n6. PRISM: P (new), R (fixed correct), I (new), S (new), M (new).

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), T(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- C, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""prism"" -> P(✓), R(✓), I(x), S(x), M(x)
Meaning:
- P is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- R is again confirmed in position 2 (we already knew this).
- I, S, M are not in the word at all.

So, combining the information:
- Correct letters in known positions: 
  - Position 1: P
  - Position 2: R
- Excluded letters: C, A, T, E, I, S, M

The secret word must start with ""PR"" and then three more letters that are not in the excluded set.

Excluded letters: A, C, E, I, M, S, T

Available letters: We can use any letter except these. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, the word is of the form: P R _ _ _

We need to guess the last three letters.

We should choose a word that:
- Starts with ""PR""
- Uses only letters not excluded (so avoid A,C,E,I,M,S,T)
- Uses common letters to maximize information.

Possible common letters to try: O, U, N, L, D, G, etc.

Let's think of words that start with ""PR"" and don't contain the excluded letters.

Examples:
- PROUD (P R O U D) -> but O, U, D are available? 
  - O: not excluded, U: not excluded, D: not excluded.
- PROWL (P R O W L)
- PROXY -> but X is less common and Y is available, but we have to check if X is excluded? X is not in the excluded list, so it's allowed, but we might prefer more common letters.
- PRONG (P R O N G)
- PROOF -> but O is repeated, and we don't know if repetition is allowed? The secret word might have repeated letters, but since we haven't seen any yet, and to maximize information, we might avoid repeats. Also, F is available.

But note: we have limited information about the last three positions, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Let me list some candidate words:
- PROUD: tests O, U, D
- PROWL: tests O, W, L
- PRONG: tests O, N, G
- PROBE: tests O, B, E -> but E is excluded! (from guess1: E is out) so PROBE is invalid because it has E.
- PRUDE: P R U D E -> E is excluded, so invalid.
- PRANK: P R A N K -> A is excluded, invalid.
- PRESS: P R E S S -> E and S are excluded, invalid.

So we must avoid A, C, E, I, M, S, T.

Therefore, PROUD is valid: P, R, O, U, D -> all allowed.

Similarly, PROWL: P, R, O, W, L -> allowed.

PRONG: P, R, O, N, G -> allowed.

PRYED: P R Y E D -> E is excluded, invalid.

PRINT: P R I N T -> I and T are excluded, invalid.

So we have a few options.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test letters that are common and might appear.

We haven't tested O, U, D, W, L, N, G, etc.

Let's consider the frequency of letters in English words.

Common letters: O, L, N, D, U, etc.

We might also consider that the word could have a vowel in position 3? Since we have only one vowel so far (if we consider Y as a vowel sometimes), but we have P and R which are consonants. The word might need a vowel.

Vowels we haven't tried: O, U, and sometimes Y.

We have excluded A, E, I. So the only vowels left are O, U, and Y (if used as vowel).

So the word must have at least one vowel in the last three positions? Not necessarily, but it's likely.

So let's try to include a vowel in position 3 or 4.

In PROUD: O (vowel) in position 3, U (vowel) in position 4, D in position 5.

In PROWL: O (vowel) in position 3, W and L (consonants) in 4 and 5.

In PRONG: O (vowel) in position 3, N and G in 4 and 5.

We could also try PRUNE: but E is excluded, so invalid.

PROUD seems good because it tests two vowels (O and U) and one consonant (D).

PROWL tests one vowel (O) and two consonants (W, L).

PRONG tests one vowel (O) and two consonants (N, G).

Since we have three positions to test, and we want to maximize information, testing two vowels might be beneficial because if they are not present, we can eliminate them.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3, so we can afford to test.

Another word: PROUD is a common word.

We could also consider: PROOF, but it has double O, which might not be efficient because if O is not in the word, we get less information. Also, F is available, but we are repeating O.

Similarly, PRESS is invalid.

What about PROUD vs PRONG? Both are valid.

I think PROUD is a good choice because it uses O and U, which are the remaining vowels, and D.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have O, to test other vowels? But the only other vowel is U, and Y.

For example, PRUDE is invalid because of E.

PRYED invalid.

PRYER: P R Y E R -> E is excluded and R is repeated? But we don't know if repetition is allowed. However, we already have R in position 2, and if we put R again, it might not be efficient. Also, E is excluded.

So no.

Another: PRUNE -> invalid because of E.

So O is the most common vowel left.

Therefore, I think PROUD is a solid choice.

But let me check if there's a word that uses Y? For example, PRYER is invalid.

PRYED invalid.

PRYING is 6 letters.

So 5-letter words: PRYER, PRYED, but both have E.

PRYER: P R Y E R -> E excluded.

So no.

Therefore, I'll go with ""PROUD"".

But wait, we have to make sure that D is not excluded. It isn't.

So guess: PROUD.

But let's see the positions: 
- P (position 1) is already correct, so we expect it to be ✓ again.
- R (position 2) is correct, ✓.
- O (position 3): we don't know.
- U (position 4): we don't know.
- D (position 5): we don't know.

After this guess, we will get feedback on O, U, D.

If any of them are correct, we'll know the position.

If they are present but wrong position, we'll know.

If absent, we can eliminate.

So it's informative.

We could also consider ""PROWL"" to test W and L, but I think PROUD is better because it tests two vowels.

Another word: ""PROBE"" is invalid.

""PRONE"": P R O N E -> E is excluded, invalid.

""PRANK"": A excluded.

So PROUD seems good.

I'll go with ""PROUD"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crate)**: R is correct and in position 2. C, A, T, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (prism)**: P is correct and in position 1. R is confirmed in position 2. I, S, M are absent.

**Key insights**:
- The secret word starts with ""PR"" (positions 1 and 2 are fixed).
- Excluded letters: A, C, E, I, M, S, T (cannot appear in the word).
- Remaining positions (3, 4, 5) must be filled with letters not in the excluded set.
- Focus on testing common vowels (O, U) and consonants (e.g., D, L, N, W) to gather new information.

For this guess, I chose **""PROUD""** because:
- It maintains P and R in positions 1 and 2.
- It tests O (vowel) in position 3, U (vowel) in position 4, and D (consonant) in position 5—all high-frequency letters not yet tested.
- It avoids all excluded letters (A, C, E, I, M, S, T).
- If O, U, or D are present (or absent), the feedback will significantly narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.

<thinking>
**Reasoning Summary**:
1. **Fixed positions**: P (1) and R (2) must be retained.
2. **Exclusions**: Eliminated letters (A, C, E, I, M, S, T) cannot be used.
3. **New letter testing**: O and U are the only remaining common vowels not tested; D is a common consonant. Testing them in positions 3–5 maximizes information gain.
4. **Word validity**: ""PROUD"" is a valid English word.
5. **Alternatives considered**: ""PROWL"" (tests O, W, L) and ""PRONG"" (tests O, N, G) were options, but ""PROUD"" tests two vowels, which is more efficient for identifying vowel presence.

<guess>proud</guess>",proud,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), T(x), E(x)

Meaning:
- P is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).

So, combining the information:
- Correct letters in known positions:

- Starts with ""PR""
- Uses only letters not excluded (so avoid A,C,E,I,M,S,T)
- Uses common letters to maximize information.

- PROUD: tests O, U, D
- PROWL: tests O, W, L

- PROBE: tests O, B, E -> but E is excluded! (from guess1: E is out) so PROBE is invalid because it has E.
- PRUDE: P R U D E -> E is excluded, so invalid.
- PRANK: P R A N K -> A is excluded, invalid.
- PRESS: P R E S S -> E and S are excluded, invalid.

So we must avoid A, C, E, I, M, S, T.

Therefore, PROUD is valid: P, R, O, U, D -> all allowed.

Similarly, PROWL: P, R, O, W, L -> allowed.

PRONG: P, R, O, N, G -> allowed.

PRYED: P R Y E D -> E is excluded, invalid.

PRINT: P R I N T -> I and T are excluded, invalid.

So we have a few options.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test letters that are common and might appear.

We haven't tested O, U, D, W, L, N, G, etc.

Let's consider the frequency of letters in English words.

Common letters: O, L, N, D, U, etc.

We might also consider that the word could have a vowel in position 3? Since we have only one vowel so far (if we consider Y as a vowel sometimes), but we have P and R which are consonants. The word might need a vowel.

Vowels we haven't tried: O, U, and sometimes Y.

We have excluded A, E, I. So the only vowels left are O, U, and Y (if used as vowel).

So the word must have at least one vowel in the last three positions? Not necessarily, but it's likely.

So let's try to include a vowel in position 3 or 4.

In PROUD: O (vowel) in position 3, U (vowel) in position 4, D in position 5.

In PROWL: O (vowel) in position 3, W and L (consonants) in 4 and 5.

In PRONG: O (vowel) in position 3, N and G in 4 and 5.

We could also try PRUNE: but E is excluded, so invalid.

PROUD seems good because it tests two vowels (O and U) and one consonant (D).

PROWL tests one vowel (O) and two consonants (W, L).

PRONG tests one vowel (O) and two consonants (N, G).

Since we have three positions to test, and we want to maximize information, testing two vowels might be beneficial because if they are not present, we can eliminate them.

PRYER: P R Y E R -> E is excluded and R is repeated? But we don't know if repetition is allowed. However, we already have R in position 2, and if we put R again, it might not be efficient. Also, E is excluded.

So no.

Another: PRUNE -> invalid because of E.

So O is the most common vowel left.

Therefore, I think PROUD is a solid choice.

But let me check if there's a word that uses Y? For example, PRYER is invalid.

PRYED invalid.

PRYING is 6 letters.

So 5-letter words: PRYER, PRYED, but both have E.

PRYER: P R Y E R -> E excluded.

So no.

Therefore, I'll go with ""PROUD"".

But wait, we have to make sure that D is not excluded. It isn't.

So guess: PROUD.

But let's see the positions: 
- P (position 1) is already correct, so we expect it to be ✓ again.
- R (position 2) is correct, ✓.
- O (position 3): we don't know.
- U (position 4): we don't know.
- D (position 5): we don't know.

After this guess, we will get feedback on O, U, D.

If any of them are correct, we'll know the position.

If they are present but wrong position, we'll know.

If absent, we can eliminate.

So it's informative.

We could also consider ""PROWL"" to test W and L, but I think PROUD is better because it tests two vowels.

Another word: ""PROBE"" is invalid.

""PRONE"": P R O N E -> E is excluded, invalid.

""PRANK"": A excluded.

 Common strategies include choosing words with common letters and avoiding repeated letters to cover more possibilities.
 Some good starting words are like ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has:
   - Common vowels: A, E
   - Common consonants: R, T, S, etc.

 I'll go with ""CRATE"". It has C, R, A, T, E.<thinking>
For the first guess, I need to select a word that maximizes information gathering. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to test which letters appear in the secret word. The word should avoid repeated letters to cover more possibilities. 

I'll choose **""CRATE""** because:
- It contains common vowels: A and E.
- It includes high-frequency consonants: C, R, T.
- The letters C, R, A, T, E are distinct, allowing me to test five unique letters.
- ""CRATE"" is a valid English word and follows the 5-letter requirement.

After submitting this guess, the feedback (✓, -, or x) for each letter will help narrow down the secret word for subsequent guesses.

So the secret word has 'R' as the second letter.

The letters C, A, T, E are eliminated. So we must avoid words containing these letters.

Now, for the next guess:
- We need to keep 'R' in the second position.
- The other four positions should be filled with letters not in the excluded set (C, A, T, E) and preferably new common letters to gather more information.

Possible common consonants left: S, L, N, B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc. (avoiding C,A,T,E)

Good strategy: Pick a word that has:
  - 'R' fixed in position 2.
  - Other positions: Use new high-frequency letters.

Example options:
- Position 1: try S, B, F, etc.
- Position 3: try I, O, U (vowels) or common consonants.
- Position 4 and 5: similar.

But we know A is out, so vowels to consider: I, O, U (since E is also out).

Let me think of a word that fits:
- Must have R in second place: _ R _ _ _

Words: BRING, BRISK, BRINK, PROUD, FRUIT, etc. But we need to avoid C,A,T,E.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Consider ""PRISM"":
- P, R, I, S, M → R is fixed at position 2. P, I, S, M are all new and not excluded.

But let me check if PRISM is allowed: yes.

Another: ""BRISK"" – B, R, I, S, K – also good.

But ""PRISM"" uses P,R,I,S,M – five letters not previously tried.

Since R is confirmed, we can try words with R in the second position and other common letters.

What about words that include other vowels? We know E and A are out, so the vowels must be I, O, U, or sometimes Y.

""SPRIG"": S, P, R, I, G – all new letters? S,P,I,G haven't been tested.

But I see that in ""crate"", we tried C,R,A,T,E – so S,P,I,G are fresh.

Also, ""BROWN"": B,R,O,W,N – O and W,N are new.

But we might want to cover more vowels. Since A and E are out, maybe test O or U or I.

I think ""PRISM"" is a strong choice because:
- It has P, I, S, M all new.
- It tests I as a vowel.

Another classic post-start word: after CRATE, with R fixed, words like ""PURRS"" but PURRS has double R, which might not be efficient since if R is already known, duplicates don't help much. Better distinct letters.

""ORRIS"" but that's obscure; PRISM is better.

What about ""RISKY""? R is the first letter, but in our case R must be second position. ""RISKY"" has R first, which won't work because we need position 2.

We must have a word with second letter R.

So viable words: 
- PRISM (P R I S M)
- BRINK (B R I N K)
- BRISK (B R I S K)
- DRINK - but D is untested, but Drink contains D,N,K – but also I? R in second.

DRINK: D,R,I,N,K – all avoid C,A,T,E.

We have to consider frequency: S, N, L are common, so including them helps.

Since we only have one correct letter so far, and four to guess, we need to test new letters.

I'll go with ""PRISM"".

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. R is confirmed at position 2.
2. C, A, T, E are excluded.
3. Next guess must include R in position 2.
4. Avoid letters: C, A, T, E.
5. Choose a word with four new letters in other positions to gather information.
6. PRISM: P (new), R (fixed correct), I (new), S (new), M (new). This tests I as a vowel and S, P, M which are common.

Therefore, I'll guess ""PRISM"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crate""):
- R is correct and in position 2.
- C, A, T, and E are not in the secret word at all.

For the next guess:
- Must have R in position 2.
- Avoid letters C, A, T, E.
- Use new, common letters to test other positions efficiently.

I chose **""PRISM""** because:
- It keeps R in position 2.
- It introduces four new letters (P, I, S, M), which are high-frequency and can help gather information quickly.
- P, I, S, M cover a mix of consonants and vowels (I is a vowel) not yet tested.

<thinking>
**Reasoning Summary:**
1. **Position 2 is fixed:** R must remain in the second slot due to the ✓ feedback.
2. **Excluded letters:** C, A, T, E must not appear in the new guess.
3. **New letter testing:** PRISM introduces P (position 1), I (position 3), S (position 4), and M (position 5)—all unconfirmed and covering a broad range of possibilities.
4. **Word validity:** ""PRISM"" is a valid English 5-letter word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), T(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- C, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""prism"" -> P(✓), R(✓), I(x), S(x), M(x)
Meaning:
- P is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- R is again confirmed in position 2 (we already knew this).
- I, S, M are not in the word at all.

So, combining the information:
- Correct letters in known positions: 
  - Position 1: P
  - Position 2: R
- Excluded letters: C, A, T, E, I, S, M

The secret word must start with ""PR"" and then three more letters that are not in the excluded set.

Excluded letters: A, C, E, I, M, S, T

Available letters: We can use any letter except these. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, the word is of the form: P R _ _ _

We need to guess the last three letters.

We should choose a word that:
- Starts with ""PR""
- Uses only letters not excluded (so avoid A,C,E,I,M,S,T)
- Uses common letters to maximize information.

Possible common letters to try: O, U, N, L, D, G, etc.

Let's think of words that start with ""PR"" and don't contain the excluded letters.

Examples:
- PROUD (P R O U D) -> but O, U, D are available? 
  - O: not excluded, U: not excluded, D: not excluded.
- PROWL (P R O W L)
- PROXY -> but X is less common and Y is available, but we have to check if X is excluded? X is not in the excluded list, so it's allowed, but we might prefer more common letters.
- PRONG (P R O N G)
- PROOF -> but O is repeated, and we don't know if repetition is allowed? The secret word might have repeated letters, but since we haven't seen any yet, and to maximize information, we might avoid repeats. Also, F is available.

But note: we have limited information about the last three positions, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Let me list some candidate words:
- PROUD: tests O, U, D
- PROWL: tests O, W, L
- PRONG: tests O, N, G
- PROBE: tests O, B, E -> but E is excluded! (from guess1: E is out) so PROBE is invalid because it has E.
- PRUDE: P R U D E -> E is excluded, so invalid.
- PRANK: P R A N K -> A is excluded, invalid.
- PRESS: P R E S S -> E and S are excluded, invalid.

So we must avoid A, C, E, I, M, S, T.

Therefore, PROUD is valid: P, R, O, U, D -> all allowed.

Similarly, PROWL: P, R, O, W, L -> allowed.

PRONG: P, R, O, N, G -> allowed.

PRYED: P R Y E D -> E is excluded, invalid.

PRINT: P R I N T -> I and T are excluded, invalid.

So we have a few options.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test letters that are common and might appear.

We haven't tested O, U, D, W, L, N, G, etc.

Let's consider the frequency of letters in English words.

Common letters: O, L, N, D, U, etc.

We might also consider that the word could have a vowel in position 3? Since we have only one vowel so far (if we consider Y as a vowel sometimes), but we have P and R which are consonants. The word might need a vowel.

Vowels we haven't tried: O, U, and sometimes Y.

We have excluded A, E, I. So the only vowels left are O, U, and Y (if used as vowel).

So the word must have at least one vowel in the last three positions? Not necessarily, but it's likely.

So let's try to include a vowel in position 3 or 4.

In PROUD: O (vowel) in position 3, U (vowel) in position 4, D in position 5.

In PROWL: O (vowel) in position 3, W and L (consonants) in 4 and 5.

In PRONG: O (vowel) in position 3, N and G in 4 and 5.

We could also try PRUNE: but E is excluded, so invalid.

PROUD seems good because it tests two vowels (O and U) and one consonant (D).

PROWL tests one vowel (O) and two consonants (W, L).

PRONG tests one vowel (O) and two consonants (N, G).

Since we have three positions to test, and we want to maximize information, testing two vowels might be beneficial because if they are not present, we can eliminate them.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3, so we can afford to test.

Another word: PROUD is a common word.

We could also consider: PROOF, but it has double O, which might not be efficient because if O is not in the word, we get less information. Also, F is available, but we are repeating O.

Similarly, PRESS is invalid.

What about PROUD vs PRONG? Both are valid.

I think PROUD is a good choice because it uses O and U, which are the remaining vowels, and D.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have O, to test other vowels? But the only other vowel is U, and Y.

For example, PRUDE is invalid because of E.

PRYED invalid.

PRYER: P R Y E R -> E is excluded and R is repeated? But we don't know if repetition is allowed. However, we already have R in position 2, and if we put R again, it might not be efficient. Also, E is excluded.

So no.

Another: PRUNE -> invalid because of E.

So O is the most common vowel left.

Therefore, I think PROUD is a solid choice.

But let me check if there's a word that uses Y? For example, PRYER is invalid.

PRYED invalid.

PRYING is 6 letters.

So 5-letter words: PRYER, PRYED, but both have E.

PRYER: P R Y E R -> E excluded.

So no.

Therefore, I'll go with ""PROUD"".

But wait, we have to make sure that D is not excluded. It isn't.

So guess: PROUD.

But let's see the positions: 
- P (position 1) is already correct, so we expect it to be ✓ again.
- R (position 2) is correct, ✓.
- O (position 3): we don't know.
- U (position 4): we don't know.
- D (position 5): we don't know.

After this guess, we will get feedback on O, U, D.

If any of them are correct, we'll know the position.

If they are present but wrong position, we'll know.

If absent, we can eliminate.

So it's informative.

We could also consider ""PROWL"" to test W and L, but I think PROUD is better because it tests two vowels.

Another word: ""PROBE"" is invalid.

""PRONE"": P R O N E -> E is excluded, invalid.

""PRANK"": A excluded.

So PROUD seems good.

I'll go with ""PROUD"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crate)**: R is correct and in position 2. C, A, T, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (prism)**: P is correct and in position 1. R is confirmed in position 2. I, S, M are absent.

**Key insights**:
- The secret word starts with ""PR"" (positions 1 and 2 are fixed).
- Excluded letters: A, C, E, I, M, S, T (cannot appear in the word).
- Remaining positions (3, 4, 5) must be filled with letters not in the excluded set.
- Focus on testing common vowels (O, U) and consonants (e.g., D, L, N, W) to gather new information.

For this guess, I chose **""PROUD""** because:
- It maintains P and R in positions 1 and 2.
- It tests O (vowel) in position 3, U (vowel) in position 4, and D (consonant) in position 5—all high-frequency letters not yet tested.
- It avoids all excluded letters (A, C, E, I, M, S, T).
- If O, U, or D are present (or absent), the feedback will significantly narrow down possibilities for the remaining letters.

<thinking>
**Reasoning Summary**:
1. **Fixed positions**: P (1) and R (2) must be retained.
2. **Exclusions**: Eliminated letters (A, C, E, I, M, S, T) cannot be used.
3. **New letter testing**: O and U are the only remaining common vowels not tested; D is a common consonant. Testing them in positions 3–5 maximizes information gain.
4. **Word validity**: ""PROUD"" is a valid English word.
5. **Alternatives considered**: ""PROWL"" (tests O, W, L) and ""PRONG"" (tests O, N, G) were options, but ""PROUD"" tests two vowels, which is more efficient for identifying vowel presence.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crate -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), T(x), E(x)
  - R is correct and in position 2.
  - C, A, T, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: prism -> P(✓), R(✓), I(x), S(x), M(x)
  - P is correct and in position 1.
  - R is still correct in position 2.
  - I, S, M are not in the word.

Guess 3: proud -> P(✓), R(✓), O(✓), U(x), D(x)
  - P, R, O are correct and in positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
  - U and D are not in the word.

So summary:
- Secret word starts with ""PRO"" for positions 1, 2, and 3.
- Excluded letters: A, C, E, I, M, S, T, U, D.
- Positions 4 and 5 are unknown but must be letters not in the excluded set and not P, R, O (since we don't know about duplicates, but we haven't seen any indication so we assume no duplicates for now).

The secret word is ""PRO__"", and we need to fill the last two positions.

Available letters: We must avoid A, C, E, I, M, S, T, U, D.

Common letters left: B, F, G, H, K, L, N, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

But we are looking for common English words that fit ""PRO"" and then two letters.

We need a valid English word starting with ""PRO"" and then two letters that are in the remaining letters.

Possible endings: We have positions 4 and 5 to guess.

Existing words:
- PROWL: P R O W L -> W and L are not excluded yet.
- PROWY? Not a word.
- PROXY: P R O X Y -> X and Y are available.
- PROFS? PROFS is not a common word; usually ""profs"" as abbreviation, but might not be accepted. We need a valid English word.
- PROLE: P R O L E -> But E is excluded, so invalid.
- PROBE: E excluded.
- PRONG: G is not excluded. ""PRONG"" is a word: P R O N G -> N and G are available.
- PROOF: O is repeated? P R O O F -> But double O. We don't know if O is duplicated. However, in positions 4 and 5: O in position 4? But we have O only in position 3. Also, F is available. ""PROOF"" is a valid word.

But in ""PROOF"", positions 4 and 5 are O and F. We already have O in position 3, so if the secret word has another O, that might be possible. However, we don't have any feedback suggesting duplicates.

Other options:
- PROVE: V and E -> E is excluded, invalid.
- PROSE: S and E excluded.
- PROTE: T and E excluded.
- PROW: only 4 letters? No, PROW is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

5-letter words starting with ""PRO"" excluding forbidden letters:

Possible:
- PROXY (X, Y)
- PRONG (N, G)
- PROWL (W, L)
- PROOF (O, F) -> with double O.
- PROSY: S excluded.
- PROUD: U and D excluded, we guessed it and U and D are out.
- PROMO: M and O -> M excluded from guess2.
- PRONE: E excluded.

Also:
- PROGS? Not common, ""prog"" as a verb is rare.
- PROYN? Not a word.
- PROKE? Not common.

So real options: PROXY, PRONG, PROWL, PROOF.

Now, letters not excluded: From above, for possible endings:

- PROXY: X and Y -> both not tried.
- PRONG: N and G -> not tried.
- PROWL: W and L -> not tried.
- PROOF: O and F -> O is already in position 3, we test if another O is in position 4 (but that would be duplicate) and F is new.

Since we don't have info on duplicates, we can try to avoid duplicates to simplify. But PROOF is a valid word.

We are on our fourth guess, and we know the first three letters are PRO. We need to guess the last two.

We could choose a word that tests two new letters efficiently.

If we guess PROXY, we test X and Y.

But X and Y are less common.

PRONG tests N and G.

PROWL tests W and L.

PROOF tests F and a possible second O.

Now, without any prior hits on W, L, N, G, etc., we need to pick one that covers common possibilities.

But note: we have only two positions left, and we need to find the word.

We could also consider words like ""PROBS"" but S excluded and not a common word.

Another: ""PRO"" words with 5 letters.

What about ""PROVY""? Not a word.

""PROEM"": E and M excluded.

So among the valid options.

But let's think about feedback: if we guess a word and get it wrong, we get feedback that might help for the next guess.

Since we are constrained, perhaps we can try PROWL first because W and L are common.

But we have to pick one.

Perhaps we should choose a word that uses letters not used before and common.

For PROXY, X and Y are uncommon.

For PRONG, N and G are common.

PROWL, W and L are common.

PROOF, if there is no duplicate O, then it will show O correct but in wrong position? In PROOF, we have O in position 4, but our secret word might have O only at position 3. In feedback for position 4 O: if it's present but position wrong, we get ""-"". If not present, we get ""x"".

But we already have O confirmed at position 3, so if there is no second O, it will be ""x"".

Similarly, F will be tested.

But PROOF is a valid word, so it could be secret.

However, to maximize information, we might avoid duplicate letters since we haven't seen any duplicates yet.

Thus, prefer words without duplicates.

PROXY, PRONG, PROWL all have no duplicates.

PROXY has X and Y, which are less frequent.

PRONG has N and G.

PROWL has W and L.

Now, frequency of letters: N is more common than G, W, L.

N is the 6th most common letter in English, G is 20th, L is 12th, W is 23rd.

In terms of ending words, after PRO, common continuations: pro + b, but B not excluded? We haven't tested B.

Words: PROBE but E excluded, PROBLEM? 6 letters.

No, we need two letters after PRO.

Common: PROXY, PRONE (but E out), PROSE (S out), etc.

PRONG and PROWL are decent.

But PRONG might be more common? Actually, ""prong"" is a word meaning a pointed projection, like fork prongs.

PROWL is also common.

To choose between them, we can flip a coin or pick one.

But we might also consider that position 5 could be a vowel if needed? But in PRONG and PROWL, both ending consonants. The word ""PROXY"" has Y which can be vowel.

But PROXY is valid.

Given we have no vowel requirement for the last two, as the word with three consonants can be fine.

I think I'll go with PRONG because N and G are common.

Alternatively, to cover more possibilities quickly, but since we are guessing the word, we can choose any.

After we guess, we know if it's correct or get feedback.

So let's guess PRONG.

But we can also consider the feedback it would give.

For example, if the secret is PROXY, and we guess PRONG, feedback: P(✓), R(✓), O(✓), N(x) because not in word? or if N is in word but position? But we know positions 1-3 fixed, so only positions 4-5 compared.

Similarly, G might be absent or present.

But we are narrowing.

Since we have only two positions, and limited tries, perhaps we should start with a word with common letters.

I think PRONG or PROWL are both fine.

Let me pick PROWL because W and L are untested.

But N and G are also untested.

PROXY: if it's not that, then X and Y eliminated, but they are less frequent.

So avoid PROXY for now.

Between PRONG and PROWL, I'll arbitrarily choose PRONG.

After all, we want to solve it.

But note: in guess 3, we guessed PROUD and got U and D out. So that word is not it.

Now, for guess 4, I'll go with ""PRONG"".Based on the accumulated feedback:

- **Positions 1, 2, and 3** are confirmed as **P**, **R**, and **O**, respectively.  
- **Excluded letters**: A, C, E, I, M, S, T, U, D.  
- The secret word is ""PRO_"" followed by two unknown letters.  
- Valid guesses must start with ""PRO"" and not use any excluded letters.

**Strategy for this guess**:
- Focus on common English endings for ""PRO"".
- Avoid letters already excluded and test new high-frequency consonants.
- Possible words like **PROXY** (X,Y), **PRONG** (N,G), **PROWL** (W,L), or **PROOF** (O,F) were considered.
- **PROXY** uses rarer letters (X,Y), so it's less prioritized.
- **PROOF** introduces a duplicate O, which is possible but not hinted at yet; avoiding duplicates first may be efficient.
- **PRONG** and **PROWL** represent common words testing new letters:  
  - **PRONG** tests N and G (both common and untested).  
  - **PROWL** tests W and L (common but slightly less frequent than N).  

I chose **""PRONG""** because:
- N is a highly common letter, and G is moderately common.
- It's a valid English word that fits perfectly with the known prefix ""PRO"" and avoids all excluded letters.
- If incorrect, feedback on N and G will help isolate the exact word quickly.

<thinking>  
**Reasoning Details**:  
1. The word must be ""PRO??"" (5 letters total).  
2. Excluded letters ensure only B, F, G, H, K, L, N, V, W, X, Y, Z are available for positions 4 and 5.  
3. ""PRONG"" tests N (position 4) and G (position 5), both fertile for information.  
4. If G or N is invalid/absent, **PROWL**, **PROXY**, or **PROOF** become backup guesses.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRATE)**: 
     - R is correct and in position 2 (✓), while C, A, T, E are absent (x).
   - **Guess 2 (PRISM)**:
     - P is correct and in position 1 (✓), R is confirmed in position 2 (✓), while I, S, M are absent (x).
   - **Guess 3 (PROUD)**:
     - P (position 1), R (position 2), and O (position 3) are correct (✓), while U and D are absent (x).
   
2. **Current Knowledge**:
   - Positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed as **P**, **R**, and **O** respectively. The secret word must start with ""PRO"".
   - **Excluded letters**: A, C, E, I, M, S, T, U, D (since marked as absent in previous guesses).
   - Positions 4 and 5 must be filled with unused letters that are not excluded. Available letters include B, F, G, H, K, N, L, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc., prioritizing high-frequency English consonants like N, G, L, W.
   - No duplicate letters are suspected yet, so we avoid reappearences of P, R, O.

3. **Possible Valid Words**:
   - Filter for valid 5-letter words starting with ""PRO"" that exclude forbidden letters:
     - **PRONG**: Uses N and G. Valid common word (e.g., fork prong).
     - **PROWL**: Uses W and L. Valid word (e.g., prowl like a cat).
     - **PROXY**: Uses X and Y. Valid word but less common letters.
     - **PROOF**: Uses O and F. Avoided due to duplicate O (untested but inefficient if O is single).

4. **Strategy Selection**:
   - **Why PRONG?** 
     - Tests **N** (position 4) and **G** (position 5), which are high-frequency letters not yet evaluated.
     - More common than alternatives like W/L (PROWL) or X/Y (PROXY), based on English letter frequency (N = 6th most common, G = 20th).
     - If incorrect, feedback on N and G will rapidly narrow options:
       - If G/N are ✓: Word solved.
       - If G/N are x: New data to pivot to PROWL/PROXY.
     - Efficient for maximizing information with minimal guesses.

5. **Conclusion**: Guess ""PRONG"" to test positions 4 and 5 while leveraging likelihood and validity.

Guess 1: crate -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), T(x), E(x)

Guess 2: prism -> P(✓), R(✓), I(x), S(x), M(x)
