We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback so we need to make the first guess.
 Since there's no information, we should start with a word that has common letters and distinct letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in word games are often like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Considering that, I'll choose a word that has common vowels and consonants: ""RAISE""

 Why ""RAISE""?
 - It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
 - All letters are distinct, so we can get maximum information about five different letters.

 Therefore, I'll start with ""RAISE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
 R -> (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 A -> (-) meaning A is in the word but in the wrong position.
 I -> (x) meaning I is not in the word.
 S -> (x) meaning S is not in the word.
 E -> (✓) meaning E is in the word and in the correct position (which is the fifth letter).

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"" (positions 1 and 2 respectively).
 - The secret word does not contain I or S.
 - The letter E is at the end (position 5) of the word.

 Since E is at the fifth position, the secret word ends with E.

 We must avoid using the letters I and S in future guesses.

 Also, note that R is in the word but not at position 1, and A is in the word but not at position 2.

 With these constraints, we think of a new word.

 Structure of the secret word: _ _ _ _ E

 We know the word has R and A, and the R cannot be at the start and A cannot be the second letter.

 We can consider common words ending in E. The fifth letter is fixed as E.

 Let's think of the positions for R and A. R is not at position 1, A is not at position 2.

 Also, note that the secret word is five letters and must include R, A and E (which we already have), and two other letters.

 Since we do not have any information about the middle letters, we can try a word that has R and A in different positions and avoids I and S.

 Possible positions for R: it could be in position 2,3,4? But note that position 1 is excluded because of the feedback. In our guess, R was at position 1 and feedback says it's not there, but it is present elsewhere.

 Similarly, A was at position 2 and feedback says it's present but not at position 2.

 So, in the new guess, we should put R at a position other than 1 (and also not positions where we've ruled out? Actually only position 1 is ruled out for R). For A, we must not put it at position 2.

 Let's aim to test new letters and try to place R and A in other positions to get more feedback.

 We can think of words ending with E and having R and A.

 Example words: 
 - carve? but we don't know if C, V are present.
 - aware: has A and R, ends with E. But note that A is at position 1 and R at position 3? 
   Also, we have to avoid S and I.

 Let's check ""aware"": 
   A, W, A, R, E -> but note: it has two A's, which might be okay.

 However, what about the constraints?
   The secret word has at least one A (since we got a minus for A). Our feedback for A specifically said it was present but not in position 2. Our first guess had A in position 2 and that was wrong.

 In ""aware"", the first letter is A. We don't know if A is in the word at position 1? It might be. Remember, the feedback for R (position 1 in first guess) was minus, meaning if we put A in position 1 that would be a different position. So it's allowed.

 Similarly, we are putting R in position 4? That wasn't tested before.

 But note: the secret word might have multiple letters? We don't know.

 However, we have only one R and one A indicated? Actually the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. So we cannot be sure.

 Given the constraint, we want to test a word that has:
   - E at the end (position 5) -> already set.
   - Includes R and A.
   - Avoids I and S.

 We also want to include as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Since the secret word has E at the end, we can try ""DANCE"" but DANCE has C which is new? But note we don't know if D, N, C are present. However, we must include R? Actually we must include R because we know it's in the word. So ""dance"" does not have R.

 Therefore, we need a word that has the letters R and A, and ends in E.

 Let's list some common words: 
   aware, argue, arose, arise -> but arise has S? (arise has S? a-r-i-s-e -> yes, but S was ruled out) so avoid arise.

 We know S is not in the word, so avoid words with S.

 Similarly, avoid I.

 So: 
   argue -> has U and G? but also E at end. And it has R and A? 
      argue: A (position 1), R (position 2), G, U, E -> but we have R at position 2? Remember feedback: R was not at position 1, but position 2 was not tested? Actually we tested R at position 1 and that was misplaced. Now if we test R at position 2, that might be correct? But we don't know.

 However, note the feedback about A: in the first guess A was at position 2 and was misplaced. So if the secret word had A at position 2, we would have gotten a check? Then that position for A is specifically wrong. But R at position 1 was wrong, but at position 2 might be okay? 

 Alternatively, let's try ""crane"" but note:
   crane: C,R,A,N,E -> but it has E at the end? Yes. But also we have S? No. However, we used ""raise"" and now we know I and S are not in the word. So we can't use crane because it includes R and A? Actually, it does include R and A. But note: we haven't used the letter C and N and also we avoid S and I.

 However, in ""crane"", R is at position 2 and A at position 3.

 But remember, in the first guess:
   R was at position 1 -> wrong position. So if the secret word has R at position 2? In ""crane"", if we put R at position 2 and if the secret word has R at position 2, we would get a check for R? 
   Similarly, A at position 3: we don't have feedback for that position.

 Also, E is at position 5 which we know is correct.

 So by trying ""crane"" we would test:
   C: new letter
   R: at position 2 -> if correct or wrong?
   A: at position 3 -> if correct or wrong?
   N: new letter
   E: known correct at position 5.

 That might be good because it tests the R at position 2 and A at position 3, and introduces C and N.

 But note: we have to avoid S and I? Crane has no S or I. Good.

 However, what if the secret word doesn't have C and N? Then we get x for them and we gain more information.

 Another possibility: ""drake"" -> D, R, A, K, E -> avoids S and I? Yes. Has R and A? Yes. Ends in E? Yes.

 In ""drake"", R is at position 2 and A at position 3? Same as crane.

 So let's choose a word that has R and A in positions we haven't tested? But we already know R can't be position 1 and A can't be position 2.

 How about we try a word with R at position 3 and A at position 4? 

 For example: ""opera"" -> o-p-e-r-a? That doesn't end with E? So not opera.

 Or ""lance"" -> has no R. Must include R.

 Or ""large"" -> letter L, A, R, G, E -> avoid S and I? Yes. 
   Large: L (1), A (2), R (3), G (4), E (5). 

 But note: in this word, 
   position 1: L -> new letter
   position 2: A -> but our feedback for A said it's not at position 2 (from the first guess). So if we put A at position 2, and if the secret word has A at position 2, we would get a check? But in our feedback, we put A at position 2 and got a minus? That means position 2 is wrong for A. So we cannot put A at position 2 again because we know it's not there.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 2? And similarly, we must avoid putting R at position 1? Yes.

 So we cannot guess ""aware"" because that puts A at position 1? Actually ""aware"" is a-w-a-r-e? Let me spell: ""aware"" is A (1), W (2), A (3), R (4), E (5). Note: two A's? 

 But the secret word may have two A's? We don't know. But in the first guess, we only had one A and got minus? Meaning that A is in the word but not in position 2. So one A is somewhere? It doesn't preclude two A's.

 However, if we put A at position 1 in ""aware"", that might be okay (if the secret word has A at position 1) or also at position 3? 

 But note: we need to test R in a new position? Previously we only tested it at position 1 and it was wrong. So we can test it at position 4? 

 Therefore, ""aware"" is a valid guess? Because:
   position 1: A -> untested for A? We only know A is not at position 2.
   position 2: W -> new letter.
   position 3: A -> but wait, we don't know if there are two A's? We simply test.
   position 4: R -> would test R at position 4? 
   position 5: E -> known.

 However, we have two A's? We don't know if the secret word has two A's? If it doesn't, then one of the A positions must match.

 But note: the secret word must have A exactly? Yes, at least one. So if we put two A's, it might mislead? Actually the feedback would mark only the A's appropriately.

 Alternatively, let's try a word with one A? But we want to maximize letter coverage.

 Another idea: we can use ""grave""? grave: G, R, A, V, E -> ends with E? yes. 
   positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:V, 5:E.

 Now, note that we are putting R at position 2? We don't know if it can be at position 2? 
   Previously R was at position 1 and misplaced -> so position 1 is wrong, but position 2 might be okay? 
 Similarly, we are putting A at position 3? We know it's not at position 2? Position 3 is new.

 Also, G and V are new.

 This seems good: we are testing R at position 2 and A at position 3? 

 But what if the secret word has A at position 3? Then we would get a check? Or if not? 

 Also, we avoid I and S? Yes.

 So let's consider ""grave"".

 However, note the feedback: we have E at the end? Yes.

 But what if the secret word doesn't have G or V? Then we get x for them.

 Alternatively, we might also consider ""price"" -> but we have I? We know I is not in the word? So avoid price? Yes, because it has I.

 Then ""grave"" seems acceptable.

 Let's think about ""crane"": 
   Crane: position1:C, position2:R, position3:A, position4:N, position5:E.
   Then:
      C: new -> we'll get feedback if present and position?
      R: position2 -> if the secret word has R at position2? 
      A: position3 -> if secret word has A at position3?
      N: new
      E: known.

 It's similar to grave? But has N instead of V.

 Since we want to maximize new letters? Both crane and grave introduce two new letters? And test R at 2 and A at 3? 

 But note: in the secret word, we don't know where A is? It could be at position 1? Or position 3? Or position 4?

 We might test R at position 4? We haven't tested that? 

 But in both crane and grave, we test R at 2. We want to get more positioning information? 

 Another word: ""parse"" -> but parse has S? Avoid since S is not in the word.

 Or ""barge"": B, A, R, G, E -> 
   positions: B (1), A (2), R (3), G (4), E (5) -> but note: A is at position2? We know that A cannot be at position 2 because in first guess we had A at position2 and it was minus? So we would be repeating a mistake? 

 Therefore, avoid putting A at position2.

 So in ""barge"", position2 is A -> so that's invalid? We know A is not at position2? So we shouldn't put it there again.

 Similarly, we must avoid putting A at position2? So we shouldn't do that.

 So ""aware"" is okay? Because in aware:
   A is at position1 and position3? and we are not putting it at position2? Position2 is W.

 Specifically:
   Position1: A -> this is a new position for A, which we haven't tested? (first guess tested A at position2) 
   Position2: W -> new
   Position3: A -> we are testing A again? But it's at position3? 
   Position4: R -> testing R at position4? 
   Position5: E

 So this tests:
   A at two positions: 1 and 3 (if the secret word has A at one of those, we'd get at least one minus? if both are wrong then both minuses? or if one matches, then a check? 
   Or in case of one occurrence? if the secret word has A only at position1, then the first A would be ✓ and the second A might be x if there's no duplicate? Actually, we are using double A? So the feedback might mark two A's? 

 But note: the feedback rule: 
   ✓ for correct position and letter.
   - for letter in word but not that position.
   x for not in word.

 But if the word has one A? Then in a guess with two A's? The rules in Wordle: 
   The feedback will assign one minus or check for each occurrence? Actually, the exact rule: 
      Each letter in the secret word is matched to the guess's letter at the same position? Then the remaining are matched? 

 But in detail: 
   The secret BRISK and guess STORM: 
        S (from guess) -> S is present? But in BRISK there's no S? So it's x? Actually the example shows S(-) -> wait no, let me see: 
        The example feedback for STORM on secret BRISK: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

        Actually, BRISK has S? no? So why is S(-)? 
        Wait, the example says ""Secret Word: BRISK"", which has S? B-R-I-S-K -> S is at position4? 

        So STORM -> 
          position1: S vs B -> S is in the word? (at position4) -> but not here? so minus
          position2: T vs R -> T not in word? x
          position3: O vs I -> not in word? x
          position4: R vs S -> R is in the word? but actually R is at position2? So for position4: we have R? but secret has S? -> S is at position4? Then R at position4: not S? so actually R is in the word but not at position4? But wait, R is already matched at position2? 

        How the feedback is generated?
          First, mark exact matches? None.
          Then, for non-matched letters in the guess, if there are non-matched same letters in the secret? So S in guess is at position1 -> secret has S at position4? non-matched? so minus? 
          Then R in guess at position4: secret has R? But secret R is at position2? which is unmatched? Then R would get a minus? 

        Similarly, T, O, M are not in secret? So x.

        So for two same letters? If there are two same A's? Then if both are correct? then both ✓? Or if one is correct? one ✓ and the other might be - if the other exists? 

 But we cannot assume duplicates? The secret word might have one R? or two? 

 Therefore, we must be cautious.

 For simplicity, we can avoid words with duplicate letters? So we can have distinct letters? 

 Then ""crane"" has no duplicates? And tests:
   position1: C -> new
   position2: R -> not tested at 2? (only at 1 tested - misplaced)
   position3: A -> not tested at 3? (only at 2 tested - misplaced)
   position4: N -> new
   position5: E -> known.

 Also, avoids I and S? Yes.

 Similarly, ""grave"" has distinct letters? Yes: G,R,A,V,E? 

 So both ""crane"" and ""grave"" are acceptable? 

 But note: we already tried ""raise"" and it used R,A,E? so ""crane"" uses R,A,E? which might be overlapping in letters? But the secret word might have more letters? So we don't know.

 Why not choose ""grave""? Or ""crane""?

 Alternatively, we can consider the frequency of letters? Let me think: 

   We have already tested: R, A, I, S, E -> so I and S are not there.

   Now, we want to test new common letters? 

   The most common letters usually: E, A, R, O, T, ... but note O hasn't been tested? 

   Crane has C, R, A, N, E -> R and A are known to be present? So we are testing C and N? 

   Grave has G, R, A, V, E -> testing G and V? 

   How common? 
      In English, N is more common than V? Also, C and G are similarly common? 

   Also, O and T might be good? 

   Therefore, another word like ""other"" -> ends with E? Wait, ""other"" doesn't end with E? 

   We need ending in E? 

   How about ""alone""? But wait, we must include R and A? Also, A at position2? We shouldn't put A at position2? Because we know it's not there.

   ""adore"" -> A at position1? Then D, O, R, E -> avoids position2 for A? And ends in E? 
       adore: A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), E(5) -> 
          A: now testing A at position1? 
          D: new
          O: new, common
          R: testing R at position4? 
          E: known.

      And avoids I and S? Yes.

      So ""adore"" is a good candidate? 

   Compare ""crane"" and ""adore""? 
        crane: tests R at position2 and A at position3? 
        adore: tests A at position1 and R at position4? 

      Which is better? 

      We know that R is not at position1? But it could be at position2? Or position4? 
      Similarly, A is not at position2? Could be at position1? Or position3? Or position4? 

      So testing different positions? 

      Also, adore uses D and O? which are popular? 

   Another candidate: ""opera"" doesn't end with E? 

   ""ample"" -> doesn't have R? 

   We definitely need to include R? We have to.

   Given these?

   Let me choose ""adore"" because it tests A at a new position (1) and R at a new position (4) and introduces D and O? common letters.

   So the new guess: ""adore""

   Alternatively, ""crane"" would test R at position2? We want to check if R is at position2? 

   Since we have limited guesses (6 total), we can only test one? 

   But whichever we choose? 

   I think both are reasonable? 

   Let me go with ""crane""? because it puts R and A both in the middle? 

   But note: the secret word might have R at position4? 

   Alternatively, ""ropey"" -> not a real word? Wait, let me stick to real words.

   After thinking, I choose ""adore"" because:

      We know E is at the end -> fixed.

      We are testing A at position1? If that's correct? then we get a check? which would be good? 
      We are testing R at position4? if that's correct? 

      Also, we are testing D and O? 

   Therefore, I'll guess ""adore"".

   So the word: adore

<guess>adore</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":  
- ✓ E is fixed at position 5.  
- ◊ R and A are in the secret word but incorrectly positioned (R cannot be at position 1, A cannot be at position 2).  
- ✗ I and S are eliminated.  

For the second guess:  
- Must include R and A while avoiding positions 1 for R and 2 for A.  
- Ends with E at position 5.  
- Tests new common letters (like O and D) for coverage.  
- ""adore"" fits:  
  - Tests A at position 1 (new position)  
  - Tests R at position 4 (untested position)  
  - Introduces new letters D (position 2) and O (position 3)  
  - Maintains E at position 5  

<guess>adore</guess>",adore,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
 R -> (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 A -> (-) meaning A is in the word but in the wrong position.
 I -> (x) meaning I is not in the word.
 S -> (x) meaning S is not in the word.
 E -> (✓) meaning E is in the word and in the correct position (which is the fifth letter).

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"" (positions 1 and 2 respectively).
 - The secret word does not contain I or S.
 - The letter E is at the end (position 5) of the word.

 Since E is at the fifth position, the secret word ends with E.

 We must avoid using the letters I and S in future guesses.

 Also, note that R is in the word but not at position 1, and A is in the word but not at position 2.

 With these constraints, we think of a new word.

 Structure of the secret word: _ _ _ _ E

 We know the word has R and A, and the R cannot be at the start and A cannot be the second letter.

 We can consider common words ending in E. The fifth letter is fixed as E.

 Let's think of the positions for R and A. R is not at position 1, A is not at position 2.

 Also, note that the secret word is five letters and must include R, A and E (which we already have), and two other letters.

 Since we do not have any information about the middle letters, we can try a word that has R and A in different positions and avoids I and S.

 Possible positions for R: it could be in position 2,3,4? But note that position 1 is excluded because of the feedback. In our guess, R was at position 1 and feedback says it's not there, but it is present elsewhere.

 Similarly, A was at position 2 and feedback says it's present but not at position 2.

 So, in the new guess, we should put R at a position other than 1 (and also not positions where we've ruled out? Actually only position 1 is ruled out for R). For A, we must not put it at position 2.

 Let's aim to test new letters and try to place R and A in other positions to get more feedback.

 We can think of words ending with E and having R and A.

 Example words: 
 - carve? but we don't know if C, V are present.
 - aware: has A and R, ends with E. But note that A is at position 1 and R at position 3? 
   Also, we have to avoid S and I.

 Let's check ""aware"": 
   A, W, A, R, E -> but note: it has two A's, which might be okay.

 However, what about the constraints?
   The secret word has at least one A (since we got a minus for A). Our feedback for A specifically said it was present but not in position 2. Our first guess had A in position 2 and that was wrong.

 In ""aware"", the first letter is A. We don't know if A is in the word at position 1? It might be. Remember, the feedback for R (position 1 in first guess) was minus, meaning if we put A in position 1 that would be a different position. So it's allowed.

 Similarly, we are putting R in position 4? That wasn't tested before.

 But note: the secret word might have multiple letters? We don't know.

 However, we have only one R and one A indicated? Actually the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. So we cannot be sure.

 Given the constraint, we want to test a word that has:
   - E at the end (position 5) -> already set.
   - Includes R and A.
   - Avoids I and S.

 We also want to include as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Since the secret word has E at the end, we can try ""DANCE"" but DANCE has C which is new? But note we don't know if D, N, C are present. However, we must include R? Actually we must include R because we know it's in the word. So ""dance"" does not have R.

 Therefore, we need a word that has the letters R and A, and ends in E.

 Let's list some common words: 
   aware, argue, arose, arise -> but arise has S? (arise has S? a-r-i-s-e -> yes, but S was ruled out) so avoid arise.

 We know S is not in the word, so avoid words with S.

 Similarly, avoid I.

 So: 
   argue -> has U and G? but also E at end. And it has R and A? 
      argue: A (position 1), R (position 2), G, U, E -> but we have R at position 2? Remember feedback: R was not at position 1, but position 2 was not tested? Actually we tested R at position 1 and that was misplaced. Now if we test R at position 2, that might be correct? But we don't know.

 However, note the feedback about A: in the first guess A was at position 2 and was misplaced. So if the secret word had A at position 2, we would have gotten a check? Then that position for A is specifically wrong. But R at position 1 was wrong, but at position 2 might be okay? 

 Alternatively, let's try ""crane"" but note:
   crane: C,R,A,N,E -> but it has E at the end? Yes. But also we have S? No. However, we used ""raise"" and now we know I and S are not in the word. So we can't use crane because it includes R and A? Actually, it does include R and A. But note: we haven't used the letter C and N and also we avoid S and I.

 However, in ""crane"", R is at position 2 and A at position 3.

 But remember, in the first guess:
   R was at position 1 -> wrong position. So if the secret word has R at position 2? In ""crane"", if we put R at position 2 and if the secret word has R at position 2, we would get a check for R? 
   Similarly, A at position 3: we don't have feedback for that position.

 Also, E is at position 5 which we know is correct.

 So by trying ""crane"" we would test:
   C: new letter
   R: at position 2 -> if correct or wrong?
   A: at position 3 -> if correct or wrong?
   N: new letter
   E: known correct at position 5.

 That might be good because it tests the R at position 2 and A at position 3, and introduces C and N.

 But note: we have to avoid S and I? Crane has no S or I. Good.

 However, what if the secret word doesn't have C and N? Then we get x for them and we gain more information.

 Another possibility: ""drake"" -> D, R, A, K, E -> avoids S and I? Yes. Has R and A? Yes. Ends in E? Yes.

 In ""drake"", R is at position 2 and A at position 3? Same as crane.

 So let's choose a word that has R and A in positions we haven't tested? But we already know R can't be position 1 and A can't be position 2.

 How about we try a word with R at position 3 and A at position 4? 

 For example: ""opera"" -> o-p-e-r-a? That doesn't end with E? So not opera.

 Or ""lance"" -> has no R. Must include R.

 Or ""large"" -> letter L, A, R, G, E -> avoid S and I? Yes. 
   Large: L (1), A (2), R (3), G (4), E (5). 

 But note: in this word, 
   position 1: L -> new letter
   position 2: A -> but our feedback for A said it's not at position 2 (from the first guess). So if we put A at position 2, and if the secret word has A at position 2, we would get a check? But in our feedback, we put A at position 2 and got a minus? That means position 2 is wrong for A. So we cannot put A at position 2 again because we know it's not there.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 2? And similarly, we must avoid putting R at position 1? Yes.

 So we cannot guess ""aware"" because that puts A at position 1? Actually ""aware"" is a-w-a-r-e? Let me spell: ""aware"" is A (1), W (2), A (3), R (4), E (5). Note: two A's? 

 But the secret word may have two A's? We don't know. But in the first guess, we only had one A and got minus? Meaning that A is in the word but not in position 2. So one A is somewhere? It doesn't preclude two A's.

 However, if we put A at position 1 in ""aware"", that might be okay (if the secret word has A at position 1) or also at position 3? 

 But note: we need to test R in a new position? Previously we only tested it at position 1 and it was wrong. So we can test it at position 4? 

 Therefore, ""aware"" is a valid guess? Because:
   position 1: A -> untested for A? We only know A is not at position 2.
   position 2: W -> new letter.
   position 3: A -> but wait, we don't know if there are two A's? We simply test.
   position 4: R -> would test R at position 4? 
   position 5: E -> known.

 However, we have two A's? We don't know if the secret word has two A's? If it doesn't, then one of the A positions must match.

 But note: the secret word must have A exactly? Yes, at least one. So if we put two A's, it might mislead? Actually the feedback would mark only the A's appropriately.

 Alternatively, let's try a word with one A? But we want to maximize letter coverage.

 Another idea: we can use ""grave""? grave: G, R, A, V, E -> ends with E? yes. 
   positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:V, 5:E.

 Now, note that we are putting R at position 2? We don't know if it can be at position 2? 
   Previously R was at position 1 and misplaced -> so position 1 is wrong, but position 2 might be okay? 
 Similarly, we are putting A at position 3? We know it's not at position 2? Position 3 is new.

 Also, G and V are new.

 This seems good: we are testing R at position 2 and A at position 3? 

 But what if the secret word has A at position 3? Then we would get a check? Or if not? 

 Also, we avoid I and S? Yes.

 So let's consider ""grave"".

 However, note the feedback: we have E at the end? Yes.

 But what if the secret word doesn't have G or V? Then we get x for them.

 Alternatively, we might also consider ""price"" -> but we have I? We know I is not in the word? So avoid price? Yes, because it has I.

 Then ""grave"" seems acceptable.

 Let's think about ""crane"": 
   Crane: position1:C, position2:R, position3:A, position4:N, position5:E.
   Then:
      C: new -> we'll get feedback if present and position?
      R: position2 -> if the secret word has R at position2? 
      A: position3 -> if secret word has A at position3?
      N: new
      E: known.

 It's similar to grave? But has N instead of V.

 Since we want to maximize new letters? Both crane and grave introduce two new letters? And test R at 2 and A at 3? 

 But note: in the secret word, we don't know where A is? It could be at position 1? Or position 3? Or position 4?

 We might test R at position 4? We haven't tested that? 

 But in both crane and grave, we test R at 2. We want to get more positioning information? 

 Another word: ""parse"" -> but parse has S? Avoid since S is not in the word.

 Or ""barge"": B, A, R, G, E -> 
   positions: B (1), A (2), R (3), G (4), E (5) -> but note: A is at position2? We know that A cannot be at position 2 because in first guess we had A at position2 and it was minus? So we would be repeating a mistake? 

 Therefore, avoid putting A at position2.

 So in ""barge"", position2 is A -> so that's invalid? We know A is not at position2? So we shouldn't put it there again.

 Similarly, we must avoid putting A at position2? So we shouldn't do that.

 So ""aware"" is okay? Because in aware:
   A is at position1 and position3? and we are not putting it at position2? Position2 is W.

 Specifically:
   Position1: A -> this is a new position for A, which we haven't tested? (first guess tested A at position2) 
   Position2: W -> new
   Position3: A -> we are testing A again? But it's at position3? 
   Position4: R -> testing R at position4? 
   Position5: E

 So this tests:
   A at two positions: 1 and 3 (if the secret word has A at one of those, we'd get at least one minus? if both are wrong then both minuses? or if one matches, then a check? 
   Or in case of one occurrence? if the secret word has A only at position1, then the first A would be ✓ and the second A might be x if there's no duplicate? Actually, we are using double A? So the feedback might mark two A's? 

 But note: the feedback rule: 
   ✓ for correct position and letter.
   - for letter in word but not that position.
   x for not in word.

 But if the word has one A? Then in a guess with two A's? The rules in Wordle: 
   The feedback will assign one minus or check for each occurrence? Actually, the exact rule: 
      Each letter in the secret word is matched to the guess's letter at the same position? Then the remaining are matched? 

 But in detail: 
   The secret BRISK and guess STORM: 
        S (from guess) -> S is present? But in BRISK there's no S? So it's x? Actually the example shows S(-) -> wait no, let me see: 
        The example feedback for STORM on secret BRISK: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

        Actually, BRISK has S? no? So why is S(-)? 
        Wait, the example says ""Secret Word: BRISK"", which has S? B-R-I-S-K -> S is at position4? 

        So STORM -> 
          position1: S vs B -> S is in the word? (at position4) -> but not here? so minus
          position2: T vs R -> T not in word? x
          position3: O vs I -> not in word? x
          position4: R vs S -> R is in the word? but actually R is at position2? So for position4: we have R? but secret has S? -> S is at position4? Then R at position4: not S? so actually R is in the word but not at position4? But wait, R is already matched at position2? 

        How the feedback is generated?
          First, mark exact matches? None.
          Then, for non-matched letters in the guess, if there are non-matched same letters in the secret? So S in guess is at position1 -> secret has S at position4? non-matched? so minus? 
          Then R in guess at position4: secret has R? But secret R is at position2? which is unmatched? Then R would get a minus? 

        Similarly, T, O, M are not in secret? So x.

        So for two same letters? If there are two same A's? Then if both are correct? then both ✓? Or if one is correct? one ✓ and the other might be - if the other exists? 

 But we cannot assume duplicates? The secret word might have one R? or two? 

 Therefore, we must be cautious.

 For simplicity, we can avoid words with duplicate letters? So we can have distinct letters? 

 Then ""crane"" has no duplicates? And tests:
   position1: C -> new
   position2: R -> not tested at 2? (only at 1 tested - misplaced)
   position3: A -> not tested at 3? (only at 2 tested - misplaced)
   position4: N -> new
   position5: E -> known.

 Also, avoids I and S? Yes.

 Similarly, ""grave"" has distinct letters? Yes: G,R,A,V,E? 

 So both ""crane"" and ""grave"" are acceptable? 

 But note: we already tried ""raise"" and it used R,A,E? so ""crane"" uses R,A,E? which might be overlapping in letters? But the secret word might have more letters? So we don't know.

 Why not choose ""grave""? Or ""crane""?

 Alternatively, we can consider the frequency of letters? Let me think: 

   We have already tested: R, A, I, S, E -> so I and S are not there.

   Now, we want to test new common letters? 

   The most common letters usually: E, A, R, O, T, ... but note O hasn't been tested? 

   Crane has C, R, A, N, E -> R and A are known to be present? So we are testing C and N? 

   Grave has G, R, A, V, E -> testing G and V? 

   How common? 
      In English, N is more common than V? Also, C and G are similarly common? 

   Also, O and T might be good? 

   Therefore, another word like ""other"" -> ends with E? Wait, ""other"" doesn't end with E? 

   We need ending in E? 

   How about ""alone""? But wait, we must include R and A? Also, A at position2? We shouldn't put A at position2? Because we know it's not there.

   ""adore"" -> A at position1? Then D, O, R, E -> avoids position2 for A? And ends in E? 
       adore: A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), E(5) -> 
          A: now testing A at position1? 
          D: new
          O: new, common
          R: testing R at position4? 
          E: known.

      And avoids I and S? Yes.

      So ""adore"" is a good candidate? 

   Compare ""crane"" and ""adore""? 
        crane: tests R at position2 and A at position3? 
        adore: tests A at position1 and R at position4? 

      Which is better? 

      We know that R is not at position1? But it could be at position2? Or position4? 
      Similarly, A is not at position2? Could be at position1? Or position3? Or position4? 

      So testing different positions? 

      Also, adore uses D and O? which are popular? 

   Another candidate: ""opera"" doesn't end with E? 

   ""ample"" -> doesn't have R? 

   We definitely need to include R? We have to.

   Given these?

   Let me choose ""adore"" because it tests A at a new position (1) and R at a new position (4) and introduces D and O? common letters.

   So the new guess: ""adore""

   Alternatively, ""crane"" would test R at position2? We want to check if R is at position2? 

   Since we have limited guesses (6 total), we can only test one? 

   But whichever we choose? 

   I think both are reasonable? 

   Let me go with ""crane""? because it puts R and A both in the middle? 

   But note: the secret word might have R at position4? 

   Alternatively, ""ropey"" -> not a real word? Wait, let me stick to real words.

   After thinking, I choose ""adore"" because:

      We know E is at the end -> fixed.

      We are testing A at position1? If that's correct? then we get a check? which would be good? 
      We are testing R at position4? if that's correct? 

      Also, we are testing D and O? 

   Therefore, I'll guess ""adore"".

   So the word: adore

<guess>adore</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":  
- ✓ E is fixed at position 5.  
- ◊ R and A are in the secret word but incorrectly positioned (R cannot be at position 1, A cannot be at position 2).  
- ✗ I and S are eliminated.  

For the second guess:  
- Must include R and A while avoiding positions 1 for R and 2 for A.  
- Ends with E at position 5.  
- Tests new common letters (like O and D) for coverage.  
- ""adore"" fits:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback so we need to make the first guess.
 Since there's no information, we should start with a word that has common letters and distinct letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in word games are often like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Considering that, I'll choose a word that has common vowels and consonants: ""RAISE""

 Why ""RAISE""?
 - It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
 - All letters are distinct, so we can get maximum information about five different letters.

 Therefore, I'll start with ""RAISE"".

 Let me output the guess accordingly.I'm making my first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I'll choose a common starting word that uses frequent letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Words like ""RAISE"" or ""CRANE"" are popular in word games because they cover multiple vowels and common consonants. 

For this first attempt, I'll select ""RAISE"":  
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)  
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of revealing useful clues about the secret word  

This sets a solid foundation for refining subsequent guesses based on feedback.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
 R -> (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 A -> (-) meaning A is in the word but in the wrong position.
 I -> (x) meaning I is not in the word.
 S -> (x) meaning S is not in the word.
 E -> (✓) meaning E is in the word and in the correct position (which is the fifth letter).

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"" (positions 1 and 2 respectively).
 - The secret word does not contain I or S.
 - The letter E is at the end (position 5) of the word.

 Since E is at the fifth position, the secret word ends with E.

 We must avoid using the letters I and S in future guesses.

 Also, note that R is in the word but not at position 1, and A is in the word but not at position 2.

 With these constraints, we think of a new word.

 Structure of the secret word: _ _ _ _ E

 We know the word has R and A, and the R cannot be at the start and A cannot be the second letter.

 We can consider common words ending in E. The fifth letter is fixed as E.

 Let's think of the positions for R and A. R is not at position 1, A is not at position 2.

 Also, note that the secret word is five letters and must include R, A and E (which we already have), and two other letters.

 Since we do not have any information about the middle letters, we can try a word that has R and A in different positions and avoids I and S.

 Possible positions for R: it could be in position 2,3,4? But note that position 1 is excluded because of the feedback. In our guess, R was at position 1 and feedback says it's not there, but it is present elsewhere.

 Similarly, A was at position 2 and feedback says it's present but not at position 2.

 So, in the new guess, we should put R at a position other than 1 (and also not positions where we've ruled out? Actually only position 1 is ruled out for R). For A, we must not put it at position 2.

 Let's aim to test new letters and try to place R and A in other positions to get more feedback.

 We can think of words ending with E and having R and A.

 Example words: 
 - carve? but we don't know if C, V are present.
 - aware: has A and R, ends with E. But note that A is at position 1 and R at position 3? 
   Also, we have to avoid S and I.

 Let's check ""aware"": 
   A, W, A, R, E -> but note: it has two A's, which might be okay.

 However, what about the constraints?
   The secret word has at least one A (since we got a minus for A). Our feedback for A specifically said it was present but not in position 2. Our first guess had A in position 2 and that was wrong.

 In ""aware"", the first letter is A. We don't know if A is in the word at position 1? It might be. Remember, the feedback for R (position 1 in first guess) was minus, meaning if we put A in position 1 that would be a different position. So it's allowed.

 Similarly, we are putting R in position 4? That wasn't tested before.

 But note: the secret word might have multiple letters? We don't know.

 However, we have only one R and one A indicated? Actually the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. So we cannot be sure.

 Given the constraint, we want to test a word that has:
   - E at the end (position 5) -> already set.
   - Includes R and A.
   - Avoids I and S.

 We also want to include as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Since the secret word has E at the end, we can try ""DANCE"" but DANCE has C which is new? But note we don't know if D, N, C are present. However, we must include R? Actually we must include R because we know it's in the word. So ""dance"" does not have R.

 Therefore, we need a word that has the letters R and A, and ends in E.

 Let's list some common words: 
   aware, argue, arose, arise -> but arise has S? (arise has S? a-r-i-s-e -> yes, but S was ruled out) so avoid arise.

 We know S is not in the word, so avoid words with S.

 Similarly, avoid I.

 So: 
   argue -> has U and G? but also E at end. And it has R and A? 
      argue: A (position 1), R (position 2), G, U, E -> but we have R at position 2? Remember feedback: R was not at position 1, but position 2 was not tested? Actually we tested R at position 1 and that was misplaced. Now if we test R at position 2, that might be correct? But we don't know.

 However, note the feedback about A: in the first guess A was at position 2 and was misplaced. So if the secret word had A at position 2, we would have gotten a check? Then that position for A is specifically wrong. But R at position 1 was wrong, but at position 2 might be okay? 

 Alternatively, let's try ""crane"" but note:
   crane: C,R,A,N,E -> but it has E at the end? Yes. But also we have S? No. However, we used ""raise"" and now we know I and S are not in the word. So we can't use crane because it includes R and A? Actually, it does include R and A. But note: we haven't used the letter C and N and also we avoid S and I.

 However, in ""crane"", R is at position 2 and A at position 3.

 But remember, in the first guess:
   R was at position 1 -> wrong position. So if the secret word has R at position 2? In ""crane"", if we put R at position 2 and if the secret word has R at position 2, we would get a check for R? 
   Similarly, A at position 3: we don't have feedback for that position.

 Also, E is at position 5 which we know is correct.

 So by trying ""crane"" we would test:
   C: new letter
   R: at position 2 -> if correct or wrong?
   A: at position 3 -> if correct or wrong?
   N: new letter
   E: known correct at position 5.

 That might be good because it tests the R at position 2 and A at position 3, and introduces C and N.

 But note: we have to avoid S and I? Crane has no S or I. Good.

 However, what if the secret word doesn't have C and N? Then we get x for them and we gain more information.

 Another possibility: ""drake"" -> D, R, A, K, E -> avoids S and I? Yes. Has R and A? Yes. Ends in E? Yes.

 In ""drake"", R is at position 2 and A at position 3? Same as crane.

 So let's choose a word that has R and A in positions we haven't tested? But we already know R can't be position 1 and A can't be position 2.

 How about we try a word with R at position 3 and A at position 4? 

 For example: ""opera"" -> o-p-e-r-a? That doesn't end with E? So not opera.

 Or ""lance"" -> has no R. Must include R.

 Or ""large"" -> letter L, A, R, G, E -> avoid S and I? Yes. 
   Large: L (1), A (2), R (3), G (4), E (5). 

 But note: in this word, 
   position 1: L -> new letter
   position 2: A -> but our feedback for A said it's not at position 2 (from the first guess). So if we put A at position 2, and if the secret word has A at position 2, we would get a check? But in our feedback, we put A at position 2 and got a minus? That means position 2 is wrong for A. So we cannot put A at position 2 again because we know it's not there.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 2? And similarly, we must avoid putting R at position 1? Yes.

 So we cannot guess ""aware"" because that puts A at position 1? Actually ""aware"" is a-w-a-r-e? Let me spell: ""aware"" is A (1), W (2), A (3), R (4), E (5). Note: two A's? 

 But the secret word may have two A's? We don't know. But in the first guess, we only had one A and got minus? Meaning that A is in the word but not in position 2. So one A is somewhere? It doesn't preclude two A's.

 However, if we put A at position 1 in ""aware"", that might be okay (if the secret word has A at position 1) or also at position 3? 

 But note: we need to test R in a new position? Previously we only tested it at position 1 and it was wrong. So we can test it at position 4? 

 Therefore, ""aware"" is a valid guess? Because:
   position 1: A -> untested for A? We only know A is not at position 2.
   position 2: W -> new letter.
   position 3: A -> but wait, we don't know if there are two A's? We simply test.
   position 4: R -> would test R at position 4? 
   position 5: E -> known.

 However, we have two A's? We don't know if the secret word has two A's? If it doesn't, then one of the A positions must match.

 But note: the secret word must have A exactly? Yes, at least one. So if we put two A's, it might mislead? Actually the feedback would mark only the A's appropriately.

 Alternatively, let's try a word with one A? But we want to maximize letter coverage.

 Another idea: we can use ""grave""? grave: G, R, A, V, E -> ends with E? yes. 
   positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:V, 5:E.

 Now, note that we are putting R at position 2? We don't know if it can be at position 2? 
   Previously R was at position 1 and misplaced -> so position 1 is wrong, but position 2 might be okay? 
 Similarly, we are putting A at position 3? We know it's not at position 2? Position 3 is new.

 Also, G and V are new.

 This seems good: we are testing R at position 2 and A at position 3? 

 But what if the secret word has A at position 3? Then we would get a check? Or if not? 

 Also, we avoid I and S? Yes.

 So let's consider ""grave"".

 However, note the feedback: we have E at the end? Yes.

 But what if the secret word doesn't have G or V? Then we get x for them.

 Alternatively, we might also consider ""price"" -> but we have I? We know I is not in the word? So avoid price? Yes, because it has I.

 Then ""grave"" seems acceptable.

 Let's think about ""crane"": 
   Crane: position1:C, position2:R, position3:A, position4:N, position5:E.
   Then:
      C: new -> we'll get feedback if present and position?
      R: position2 -> if the secret word has R at position2? 
      A: position3 -> if secret word has A at position3?
      N: new
      E: known.

 It's similar to grave? But has N instead of V.

 Since we want to maximize new letters? Both crane and grave introduce two new letters? And test R at 2 and A at 3? 

 But note: in the secret word, we don't know where A is? It could be at position 1? Or position 3? Or position 4?

 We might test R at position 4? We haven't tested that? 

 But in both crane and grave, we test R at 2. We want to get more positioning information? 

 Another word: ""parse"" -> but parse has S? Avoid since S is not in the word.

 Or ""barge"": B, A, R, G, E -> 
   positions: B (1), A (2), R (3), G (4), E (5) -> but note: A is at position2? We know that A cannot be at position 2 because in first guess we had A at position2 and it was minus? So we would be repeating a mistake? 

 Therefore, avoid putting A at position2.

 So in ""barge"", position2 is A -> so that's invalid? We know A is not at position2? So we shouldn't put it there again.

 Similarly, we must avoid putting A at position2? So we shouldn't do that.

 So ""aware"" is okay? Because in aware:
   A is at position1 and position3? and we are not putting it at position2? Position2 is W.

 Specifically:
   Position1: A -> this is a new position for A, which we haven't tested? (first guess tested A at position2) 
   Position2: W -> new
   Position3: A -> we are testing A again? But it's at position3? 
   Position4: R -> testing R at position4? 
   Position5: E

 So this tests:
   A at two positions: 1 and 3 (if the secret word has A at one of those, we'd get at least one minus? if both are wrong then both minuses? or if one matches, then a check? 
   Or in case of one occurrence? if the secret word has A only at position1, then the first A would be ✓ and the second A might be x if there's no duplicate? Actually, we are using double A? So the feedback might mark two A's? 

 But note: the feedback rule: 
   ✓ for correct position and letter.
   - for letter in word but not that position.
   x for not in word.

 But if the word has one A? Then in a guess with two A's? The rules in Wordle: 
   The feedback will assign one minus or check for each occurrence? Actually, the exact rule: 
      Each letter in the secret word is matched to the guess's letter at the same position? Then the remaining are matched? 

 But in detail: 
   The secret BRISK and guess STORM: 
        S (from guess) -> S is present? But in BRISK there's no S? So it's x? Actually the example shows S(-) -> wait no, let me see: 
        The example feedback for STORM on secret BRISK: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

        Actually, BRISK has S? no? So why is S(-)? 
        Wait, the example says ""Secret Word: BRISK"", which has S? B-R-I-S-K -> S is at position4? 

        So STORM -> 
          position1: S vs B -> S is in the word? (at position4) -> but not here? so minus
          position2: T vs R -> T not in word? x
          position3: O vs I -> not in word? x
          position4: R vs S -> R is in the word? but actually R is at position2? So for position4: we have R? but secret has S? -> S is at position4? Then R at position4: not S? so actually R is in the word but not at position4? But wait, R is already matched at position2? 

        How the feedback is generated?
          First, mark exact matches? None.
          Then, for non-matched letters in the guess, if there are non-matched same letters in the secret? So S in guess is at position1 -> secret has S at position4? non-matched? so minus? 
          Then R in guess at position4: secret has R? But secret R is at position2? which is unmatched? Then R would get a minus? 

        Similarly, T, O, M are not in secret? So x.

        So for two same letters? If there are two same A's? Then if both are correct? then both ✓? Or if one is correct? one ✓ and the other might be - if the other exists? 

 But we cannot assume duplicates? The secret word might have one R? or two? 

 Therefore, we must be cautious.

 For simplicity, we can avoid words with duplicate letters? So we can have distinct letters? 

 Then ""crane"" has no duplicates? And tests:
   position1: C -> new
   position2: R -> not tested at 2? (only at 1 tested - misplaced)
   position3: A -> not tested at 3? (only at 2 tested - misplaced)
   position4: N -> new
   position5: E -> known.

 Also, avoids I and S? Yes.

 Similarly, ""grave"" has distinct letters? Yes: G,R,A,V,E? 

 So both ""crane"" and ""grave"" are acceptable? 

 But note: we already tried ""raise"" and it used R,A,E? so ""crane"" uses R,A,E? which might be overlapping in letters? But the secret word might have more letters? So we don't know.

 Why not choose ""grave""? Or ""crane""?

 Alternatively, we can consider the frequency of letters? Let me think: 

   We have already tested: R, A, I, S, E -> so I and S are not there.

   Now, we want to test new common letters? 

   The most common letters usually: E, A, R, O, T, ... but note O hasn't been tested? 

   Crane has C, R, A, N, E -> R and A are known to be present? So we are testing C and N? 

   Grave has G, R, A, V, E -> testing G and V? 

   How common? 
      In English, N is more common than V? Also, C and G are similarly common? 

   Also, O and T might be good? 

   Therefore, another word like ""other"" -> ends with E? Wait, ""other"" doesn't end with E? 

   We need ending in E? 

   How about ""alone""? But wait, we must include R and A? Also, A at position2? We shouldn't put A at position2? Because we know it's not there.

   ""adore"" -> A at position1? Then D, O, R, E -> avoids position2 for A? And ends in E? 
       adore: A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), E(5) -> 
          A: now testing A at position1? 
          D: new
          O: new, common
          R: testing R at position4? 
          E: known.

      And avoids I and S? Yes.

      So ""adore"" is a good candidate? 

   Compare ""crane"" and ""adore""? 
        crane: tests R at position2 and A at position3? 
        adore: tests A at position1 and R at position4? 

      Which is better? 

      We know that R is not at position1? But it could be at position2? Or position4? 
      Similarly, A is not at position2? Could be at position1? Or position3? Or position4? 

      So testing different positions? 

      Also, adore uses D and O? which are popular? 

   Another candidate: ""opera"" doesn't end with E? 

   ""ample"" -> doesn't have R? 

   We definitely need to include R? We have to.

   Given these?

   Let me choose ""adore"" because it tests A at a new position (1) and R at a new position (4) and introduces D and O? common letters.

   So the new guess: ""adore""

   Alternatively, ""crane"" would test R at position2? We want to check if R is at position2? 

   Since we have limited guesses (6 total), we can only test one? 

   But whichever we choose? 

   I think both are reasonable? 

   Let me go with ""crane""? because it puts R and A both in the middle? 

   But note: the secret word might have R at position4? 

   Alternatively, ""ropey"" -> not a real word? Wait, let me stick to real words.

   After thinking, I choose ""adore"" because:

      We know E is at the end -> fixed.

      We are testing A at position1? If that's correct? then we get a check? which would be good? 
      We are testing R at position4? if that's correct? 

      Also, we are testing D and O? 

   Therefore, I'll guess ""adore"".

   So the word: adore

<guess>adore</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":  
- ✓ E is fixed at position 5.  
- ◊ R and A are in the secret word but incorrectly positioned (R cannot be at position 1, A cannot be at position 2).  
- ✗ I and S are eliminated.  

For the second guess:  
- Must include R and A while avoiding positions 1 for R and 2 for A.  
- Ends with E at position 5.  
- Tests new common letters (like O and D) for coverage.  
- ""adore"" fits:  
  - Tests A at position 1 (new position)  
  - Tests R at position 4 (untested position)  
  - Introduces new letters D (position 2) and O (position 3)  
  - Maintains E at position 5

In our guess, R was at position 1 and feedback says it\'s not there, but it is present elsewhere.\n\n Similarly, A was at position 2 and feedback says it\'s present but not at position 2.\n\n So, in the new guess, we should put R at a position other than 1 (and also not positions where we\'ve ruled out?

That doesn\'t end with E? So not opera.\n\n Or ""lance"" -> has no R. Must include R.\n\n Or ""large"" -> letter L, A, R, G, E -> avoid S and I?

So if we put A at position 2, and if the secret word has A at position 2, we would get a check? But in our feedback, we put A at position 2 and got a minus? That means position 2 is wrong for A. So we cannot put A at position 2 again because we know it\'s not there.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 2? And similarly, we must avoid putting R at position 1? Yes.\n\n So we cannot guess ""aware"" because that puts A at position 1? Actually ""aware"" is a-w-a-r-e? Let me spell: ""aware"" is A (1), W (2), A (3), R (4), E (5). Note: two A\'s? \n\n But the secret word may have two A\'s? We don\'t know. But in the first guess, we only had one A and got minus? Meaning that A is in the word but not in position 2. So one A is somewhere? It doesn\'t preclude two A\'s.\n\n However, if we put A at position 1 in ""aware"", that might be okay (if the secret word has A at position 1) or also at position 3? \n\n But note: we need to test R in a new position? Previously we only tested it at position 1 and it was wrong. So we can test it at position 4? \n\n Therefore, ""aware"" is a valid guess? Because:\n   position 1: A -> untested for A? We only know A is not at position 2.\n   position 2: W -> new letter.\n   position 3: A -> but wait, we don\'t know if there are two A\'s? We simply test.\n   position 4: R -> would test R at position 4? \n   position 5: E -> known.\n\n However, we have two A\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? If it doesn\'t, then one of the A positions must match.\n\n But note: the secret word must have A exactly? Yes, at least one. So if we put two A\'s, it might mislead? Actually the feedback would mark only the A\'s appropriately.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s try a word with one A? But we want to maximize letter coverage.\n\n Another idea: we can use ""grave""? grave: G, R, A, V, E -> ends with E? yes. \n   positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:V, 5:E.\n\n Now, note that we are putting R at position 2? We don\'t know if it can be at position 2? \n   Previously R was at position 1 and misplaced -> so position 1 is wrong, but position 2 might be okay? \n Similarly, we are putting A at position 3? We know it\'s not at position 2? Position 3 is new.\n\n Also, G and V are new.\n\n This seems good: we are testing R at position 2 and A at position 3? \n\n But what if the secret word has A at position 3? Then we would get a check? Or if not? \n\n Also, we avoid I and S? Yes.\n\n So let\'s consider ""grave"".\n\n However, note the feedback: we have E at the end? Yes.\n\n But what if the secret word doesn\'t have G or V? Then we get x for them.\n\n Alternatively, we might also consider ""price"" -> but we have I? We know I is not in the word? So avoid price? Yes, because it has I.\n\n Then ""grave"" seems acceptable.\n\n Let\'s think about ""crane"": \n   Crane: position1:C, position2:R, position3:A, position4:N, position5:E.\n   Then:\n      C: new -> we\'ll get feedback if present and position?\n      R: position2 -> if the secret word has R at position2? \n      A: position3 -> if secret word has A at position3?\n      N: new\n      E: known.\n\n It\'s similar to grave? But has N instead of V.\n\n Since we want to maximize new letters? Both crane and grave introduce two new letters? And test R at 2 and A at 3? \n\n But note: in the secret word, we don\'t know where A is? It could be at position 1? Or position 3? Or position 4?\n\n We might test R at position 4? We haven\'t tested that? \n\n But in both crane and grave, we test R at 2. We want to get more positioning information? \n\n Another word: ""parse"" -> but parse has S? Avoid since S is not in the word.\n\n Or ""barge"": B, A, R, G, E -> \n   positions: B (1), A (2), R (3), G (4), E (5) -> but note: A is at position2? We know that A cannot be at position 2 because in first guess we had A at position2 and it was minus? So we would be repeating a mistake? \n\n Therefore, avoid putting A at position2.\n\n So in ""barge"", position2 is A -> so that\'s invalid? We know A is not at position2? So we shouldn\'t put it there again.\n\n Similarly, we must avoid putting A at position2? So we shouldn\'t do that.\n\n So ""aware"" is okay? Because in aware:\n   A is at position1 and position3? and we are not putting it at position2? Position2 is W.\n\n Specifically:\n   Position1: A -> this is a new position for A, which we haven\'t tested? (first guess tested A at position2) \n   Position2: W -> new\n   Position3: A -> we are testing A again? But it\'s at position3? \n   Position4: R -> testing R at position4? \n   Position5: E\n\n So this tests:\n   A at two positions: 1 and 3 (if the secret word has A at one of those, we\'d get at least one minus? if both are wrong then both minuses? or if one matches, then a check? \n   Or in case of one occurrence? if the secret word has A only at position1, then the first A would be ✓ and the second A might be x if there\'s no duplicate? Actually, we are using double A? So the feedback might mark two A\'s? \n\n But note: the feedback rule: \n   ✓ for correct position and letter.\n   - for letter in word but not that position.\n   x for not in word.\n\n But if the word has one A? Then in a guess with two A\'s? The rules in Wordle: \n   The feedback will assign one minus or check for each occurrence? Actually, the exact rule: \n      Each letter in the secret word is matched to the guess\'s letter at the same position? Then the remaining are matched? \n\n But in detail: \n   The secret BRISK and guess STORM: \n        S (from guess) -> S is present? But in BRISK there\'s no S? So it\'s x? Actually the example shows S(-) -> wait no, let me see: \n        The example feedback for STORM on secret BRISK: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)\n\n        Actually, BRISK has S? no? So why is S(-)? \n        Wait, the example says ""Secret Word: BRISK"", which has S? B-R-I-S-K -> S is at position4? \n\n        So STORM -> \n          position1: S vs B -> S is in the word? (at position4) -> but not here? so minus\n          position2: T vs R -> T not in word? x\n          position3: O vs I -> not in word? x\n          position4: R vs S -> R is in the word? but actually R is at position2? So for position4: we have R? but secret has S? -> S is at position4? Then R at position4: not S? so actually R is in the word but not at position4? But wait, R is already matched at position2? \n\n        How the feedback is generated?\n          First, mark exact matches? None.\n          Then, for non-matched letters in the guess, if there are non-matched same letters in the secret? So S in guess is at position1 -> secret has S at position4? non-matched? so minus? \n          Then R in guess at position4: secret has R? But secret R is at position2? which is unmatched? Then R would get a minus? \n\n        Similarly, T, O, M are not in secret? So x.\n\n        So for two same letters? If there are two same A\'s? Then if both are correct? then both ✓? Or if one is correct? one ✓ and the other might be - if the other exists? \n\n But we cannot assume duplicates? The secret word might have one R? or two? \n\n Therefore, we must be cautious.\n\n For simplicity, we can avoid words with duplicate letters? So we can have distinct letters? \n\n Then ""crane"" has no duplicates? And tests:\n   position1: C -> new\n   position2: R -> not tested at 2? (only at 1 tested - misplaced)\n   position3: A -> not tested at 3? (only at 2 tested - misplaced)\n   position4: N -> new\n   position5: E -> known.\n\n Also, avoids I and S? Yes.\n\n Similarly, ""grave"" has distinct letters? Yes: G,R,A,V,E? \n\n So both ""crane"" and ""grave"" are acceptable? \n\n But note: we already tried ""raise"" and it used R,A,E? so ""crane"" uses R,A,E? which might be overlapping in letters? But the secret word might have more letters? So we don\'t know.\n\n Why not choose ""grave""? Or ""crane""?\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the frequency of letters? Let me think: \n\n   We have already tested: R, A, I, S, E -> so I and S are not there.\n\n   Now, we want to test new common letters? \n\n   The most common letters usually: E, A, R, O, T, ... but note O hasn\'t been tested? \n\n   Crane has C, R, A, N, E -> R and A are known to be present? So we are testing C and N? \n\n   Grave has G, R, A, V, E -> testing G and V? \n\n   How common? \n      In English, N is more common than V? Also, C and G are similarly common? \n\n   Also, O and T might be good? \n\n   Therefore, another word like ""other"" -> ends with E? Wait, ""other"" doesn\'t end with E? \n\n   We need ending in E? \n\n   How about ""alone""? But wait, we must include R and A? Also, A at position2? We shouldn\'t put A at position2? Because we know it\'s not there.\n\n   ""adore"" -> A at position1? Then D, O, R, E -> avoids position2 for A? And ends in E? \n       adore: A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), E(5) -> \n          A: now testing A at position1? \n          D: new\n          O: new, common\n          R: testing R at position4? \n          E: known.\n\n      And avoids I and S? Yes.\n\n      So ""adore"" is a good candidate? \n\n   Compare ""crane"" and ""adore""? \n        crane: tests R at position2 and A at position3? \n        adore: tests A at position1 and R at position4? \n\n      Which is better? \n\n      We know that R is not at position1? But it could be at position2? Or position4? \n      Similarly, A is not at position2? Could be at position1? Or position3? Or position4? \n\n      So testing different positions? \n\n      Also, adore uses D and O? which are popular? \n\n   Another candidate: ""opera"" doesn\'t end with E? \n\n   ""ample"" -> doesn\'t have R? \n\n   We definitely need to include R? We have to.\n\n   Given these?\n\n   Let me choose ""adore"" because it tests A at a new position (1) and R at a new position (4) and introduces D and O? common letters.\n\n   So the new guess: ""adore""\n\n   Alternatively, ""crane"" would test R at position2? We want to check if R is at position2? \n\n   Since we have limited guesses (6 total), we can only test one? \n\n   But whichever we choose? \n\n   I think both are reasonable? \n\n   Let me go with ""crane""? because it puts R and A both in the middle? \n\n   But note: the secret word might have R at position4? \n\n   Alternatively, ""ropey"" -> not a real word? Wait, let me stick to real words.\n\n   After thinking, I choose ""adore"" because:\n\n      We know E is at the end -> fixed.\n\n      We are testing A at position1? If that\'s correct? then we get a check? which would be good? \n      We are testing R at position4? if that\'s correct? \n\n      Also, we are testing D and O? \n\n   Therefore, I\'ll guess ""adore"".\n\n   So the word: adore\n\n<guess>adore</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":  \n- ✓ E is fixed at position 5.  \n- ◊ R and A are in the secret word but incorrectly positioned (R cannot be at position 1, A cannot be at position 2).  \n- ✗ I and S are eliminated.  \n\nFor the second guess:  \n- Must include R and A while avoiding positions 1 for R and 2 for A.  \n- Ends with E at position 5.  \n- Tests new common letters (like O and D) for coverage.  \n- ""adore"" fits:  \n  - Tests A at position 1 (new position)  \n  - Tests R at position 4 (untested position)  \n  - Introduces new letters D (position 2) and O (position 3)  \n  - Maintains E at position 5\n\n<guess>adore</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: adore -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given cumulative feedback:

Guess 1: ""raise"" -> R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- R is in the word, but not in position 1.
- A is in the word, but not in position 2.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word and at position 5 (correct).

Guess 2: ""adore"" -> A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)
Meaning:
- A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- D is not in the word.
- O is not in the word.
- R is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E is confirmed at position 5.

Synthesis:
- E is fixed at position 5: the word has to be _ _ _ _ E
- Letters R and A are present, but they are not in the positions they were guessed: 
  - R: not at position 1 (from guess1) and not at position 4 (from guess2)
- A: not at position 2 (from guess1) and not at position 1 (from guess2)
- Letters I, S, D, O are absent.

Therefore, we know the word ends with E, contains R and A, and excludes I, S, D, O.

Now, we need to consider remaining positions for R and A:
- R must be in position 2, 3 or 5? But position 5 is E -> so positions 2 or 3.
- Similarly, A must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But E is at 5 -> so A at 3 or 4? But positions: 1,2,3,4 are free? Actually, position 5 is fixed as E.

We must re-check positions:
- Secret word: position 1: ?; position 2: ?; position 3: ?; position 4: ?; position 5: E

Constraints:
- A: cannot be position 1 (tested in adore) and not position 2 (tested in raise) -> so A must be in position 3 or 4.
- R: cannot be position 1 (tested in raise) and not position 4 (tested in adore) -> so R must be in position 2 or 3.

Possible conflicts? Position 3: might be both R or A? But it can only be one? So we must account.

Also, the word must be a 5-letter English word ending in E, with R and A, without I,S,D,O.

We need to consider other letters? We have tested: R, A, I, S, E, D, O, and Adore also used the letters A, D, O, R, E.

Thus, absent letters: I, S, D, O.

Now, what other letters could appear? We don't know? We have to guess letters not excluded.

Therefore, pick a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Includes R and A in the positions: 
  R: only allowed in 2 or 3? 
  A: only in 3 or 4.

But note: the positions for R and A might be the same if position 3? But if both are required? And if position 3? Then the other must be elsewhere? 

Actually, the positions for R and A must be different? Because they are two distinct letters? So:
- Option 1: R at position 2, then A at position 3 or 4? 
- Option 2: R at position 3, then A at position 4? (because position 2 is taken? if R at 3 then A must be at 4, because A cannot be at 1 or 2? and position 1 is the only other? but position 1 is free? but A cannot be at 1? and we already tested that).

Wait: 
- A cannot be at 1? Cannot be at 2? That leaves positions 3 and 4? 
- R cannot be at 1? Cannot be at 4? Which leaves positions 2 and 3.

Now common words ending in E? 

Case 1: R at position 2, A at position 3: then the word would be _ R A _ E? 
Example words: 
- crate: but T and C are allowed? But crate has C, R, A, T, E -> ends with E? 
  Position 2: R? fixed? 
  Position 3: A? fixed?
  Then positions 1: C and 4: T? 

But is C and T present? We don't know? 

If we guess ""crate"", then:
  C: new letter?
  R: at position 2? which we haven't tested? 
  A: at position 3? which we haven't tested?
  T: new letter?
  E: known.

And check the constraints? We avoid I,S,D,O? crate has C, R, A, T, E -> none of I,S,D,O? so acceptable.

But note: what about the possibility of R at position 3 and A at position 4? Then the word is _ _ R A E? 
Example: ""trace"": but trace has T, R, A, C, E -> positions: T(1), R(2) -> wait R at position2? which is the same as above? Actually, wait: if R is at position 3? and A at position4? Then the word? 
Example: ""brace""? B (1), R (2), A (3), C (4), E (5) -> but that's R at 2 and A at 3? 

We need an example with R at 3 and A at 4? 
Like ""flare"": but flare has F, L, A, R, E -> positions: 
  flare: F(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> but R is at 4? we already know R isn't at position4? 

Other word: ""agree""? but agree has A at position1? which we know A isn't at position1? (from adore) -> rejected? 
Another: ""brave"": which was already tried? no? 
But ""brave"": B, R, A, V, E -> positions: R at 2? that's the same as above? 

Wait, I think it's hard? 

Actually, there is ""frame"": F, R, A, M, E -> positions: R at 2? again? 

What about ""grace"": G, R, A, C, E -> positions: R at 2? 

Possibly: ""graze""? It has S? no, Z -> ""graze"" has Z? But we don't know about Z? But note: we haven't ruled out Z? 

But we need R at 3? Let's think: 
  position1: ? 
  position2: some letter?
  position3: R?
  position4: A?
  position5: E

Words: ? 
  Like ""tare""? 4 letters? 

Five letter words: ""care""? 4 letters? 

Examples: 
  ""store""? but S is excluded? 
  ""shire""? S excluded? 

Actually, I cannot find a word with R at position3 and A at position4? But they exist? Such as ""opera"": but opera has O? excluded? 

Another: ""extra"": ends with A? not E? 

""aurae""? which might be not common? 

So perhaps the possibility is low? 

Since we are limited to a small set? 

But we have another option: R at position 3? A at position 4? 

But note: R cannot be at position 4? We tested in adore? So if R is at position 3? That's allowed? Then A at position 4? then word: _ _ R A E? 

Then what about position1 and position2? 

Example: ""brace""? that's 5 letter? B, R, A, C, E -> but R at position2? not at position3? 

To have R at position3: 
  position3: R? 
  position4: A? 

Then valid example: ""flare""? but as we noted ""flare"": positions: 
  F(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> Wait, A at 3? and R at4? But we want R at position3? 

We need R at position3 and A at position4? 

Example: ""opera"" -> O(1), P(2), E(3), R(4), A(5) -> doesn't end with E? 

Another: ""myrrh"" doesn't end with E? 

Actually, let's try: five letters: _ _ R A E -> but with E? The fifth letter is E? So the word pattern: X Y R A E? 

But ""? ? R A E"": any English words? 

Example: ""URAEM"" not valid? 

""grape""? G(1), R(2), A(3), P(4), E(5) -> again R at2? 

""trace"": T, R, A, C, E -> R at2? 

It appears that words with R at position3 and A at position4 and ending in E are rare? 

What about ""grave"": G, R, A, V, E -> R at2? 

So I think the pattern of _ _ R A E might not exist? Therefore, the more likely scenario is R at position2 and A at position3? 

Therefore, I'll guess a word with R at position2 and A at position3, ending in E? And avoid I, S, D, O? 

Therefore, ""crate"" is a candidate? C, R, A, T, E? 

We haven't tested position1. Position4: we haven't tested? 

Another candidate: ""great""? G, R, E, A, T -> doesn't end with E? 

""grade"": G, R, A, D, E -> but D is excluded? 

""graze"": G, R, A, Z, E -> avoids D,O,I,S? Z not tested? 
But ""graze"" is a word? 

But since D and O are excluded, we can include Z? 

Similarly, ""trace"": T, R, A, C, E -> C and T? 

But note: we don't know about T, C, and so on? 

So why not ""crate""? 

But also, ""brave"": B, R, A, V, E -> avoids I,S,D,O? 

So both ""brave"" and ""crate"" are candidates? 

Also, ""frate""? not a word? 

I think I'll choose ""brave"" because we haven't tested B or V? 

But ""crate"" has C and T? which are common? 

Alternatively, note that we have already tested: 
  raise: 5 letters
  adore: 5 letters

So the secret word must contain R and A and E? 

Also, it might contain two other letters? 

We need to test new letters? 

Therefore, let's choose ""brave"": 
  B: new
  R: at position 2 (untested? yes)
  A: at position 3 (untested? yes)
  V: new
  E: fixed at 5? 

But position4 in brave is V? 

If we guess and it's wrong? Then we get feedback on B, V? 

But we can also test for both possibilities? 

After thinking, let's go with ""brave""? 

Alternatively, a word that doesn't fix R and A? But we must fix? because the letter requirements? 

Actually, we must include R and A? And E? 

Also, avoid I,S,D,O? 

Thus, brave: B (new), R, A, V (new), E -> valid? 

Yes.

Therefore, new guess: brave

But let me confirm: 
  Position1: B? 
  Position2: R -> which we haven't tested? 
  Position3: A -> which we haven't tested? 
  Position4: V -> 
  Position5: E? 

If the secret word has A at position3 (if we are lucky) then we'd get A(✓)? 

Similarly, R if at position2? would be R(✓)? 

But note: we don't know if R is at position2? It could be at position3? then A must be at position4? and our guess brave? 
  Position3: A? -> if the secret has R at position2? then A might not at position3? then we get A(-)? 

But we are testing the hypothesis? 

Alternatively, a word that doesn't commit? But then we must include R and A? 

Another word: ""agree""? But A at position1? excluded? and also G? 

""price""? has I? excluded? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""brave"". 

So <guess>brave</guess>
</think>
Based on previous feedback:  
- **E is fixed at position 5** in all guesses.  
- **R and A** must be in the word but **incorrectly positioned**:  
  - R: Cannot be pos1 (from ""raise"") or pos4 (from ""adore"") → must be pos2 or pos3.  
  - A: Cannot be pos2 (from ""raise"") or pos1 (from ""adore"") → must be pos3 or pos4.  
- **Eliminated letters**: I, S, D, O.  
- Remaining possibilities require testing R at pos2 ⚬, A at pos3 ⚬, and avoiding eliminated letters.  

Optimal guess: ""brave""  
- Tests R at pos2 and A at pos3 (untested positions).  
- Introduces new common consonants (B, V) for coverage.  
- Ends with E (✓).  
- Avoids I/S/D/O.  

<guess>brave</guess>",brave,"We are given cumulative feedback:

Guess 1: ""raise"" -> R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- R is in the word, but not in position 1.
- A is in the word, but not in position 2.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word and at position 5 (correct).

Guess 2: ""adore"" -> A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)
Meaning:
- A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- D is not in the word.
- O is not in the word.
- R is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E is confirmed at position 5.

Synthesis:
- E is fixed at position 5: the word has to be _ _ _ _ E
- Letters R and A are present, but they are not in the positions they were guessed: 
  - R: not at position 1 (from guess1) and not at position 4 (from guess2)
- A: not at position 2 (from guess1) and not at position 1 (from guess2)
- Letters I, S, D, O are absent.

Therefore, we know the word ends with E, contains R and A, and excludes I, S, D, O.

Now, we need to consider remaining positions for R and A:
- R must be in position 2, 3 or 5? But position 5 is E -> so positions 2 or 3.
- Similarly, A must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But E is at 5 -> so A at 3 or 4? But positions: 1,2,3,4 are free? Actually, position 5 is fixed as E.

We must re-check positions:
- Secret word: position 1: ?; position 2: ?; position 3: ?; position 4: ?; position 5: E

Constraints:
- A: cannot be position 1 (tested in adore) and not position 2 (tested in raise) -> so A must be in position 3 or 4.
- R: cannot be position 1 (tested in raise) and not position 4 (tested in adore) -> so R must be in position 2 or 3.

Possible conflicts? Position 3: might be both R or A? But it can only be one? So we must account.

Also, the word must be a 5-letter English word ending in E, with R and A, without I,S,D,O.

We need to consider other letters? We have tested: R, A, I, S, E, D, O, and Adore also used the letters A, D, O, R, E.

Thus, absent letters: I, S, D, O.

Now, what other letters could appear? We don't know? We have to guess letters not excluded.

Therefore, pick a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Includes R and A in the positions: 
  R: only allowed in 2 or 3? 
  A: only in 3 or 4.

But note: the positions for R and A might be the same if position 3? But if both are required? And if position 3? Then the other must be elsewhere? 

Actually, the positions for R and A must be different? Because they are two distinct letters? So:
- Option 1: R at position 2, then A at position 3 or 4? 
- Option 2: R at position 3, then A at position 4? (because position 2 is taken? if R at 3 then A must be at 4, because A cannot be at 1 or 2? and position 1 is the only other? but position 1 is free? but A cannot be at 1? and we already tested that).

Wait: 
- A cannot be at 1? Cannot be at 2? That leaves positions 3 and 4? 
- R cannot be at 1? Cannot be at 4? Which leaves positions 2 and 3.

Now common words ending in E? 

Case 1: R at position 2, A at position 3: then the word would be _ R A _ E? 
Example words: 
- crate: but T and C are allowed? But crate has C, R, A, T, E -> ends with E? 
  Position 2: R? fixed? 
  Position 3: A? fixed?
  Then positions 1: C and 4: T? 

But is C and T present? We don't know? 

If we guess ""crate"", then:
  C: new letter?
  R: at position 2? which we haven't tested? 
  A: at position 3? which we haven't tested?
  T: new letter?
  E: known.

And check the constraints? We avoid I,S,D,O? crate has C, R, A, T, E -> none of I,S,D,O? so acceptable.

But note: what about the possibility of R at position 3 and A at position 4? Then the word is _ _ R A E? 
Example: ""trace"": but trace has T, R, A, C, E -> positions: T(1), R(2) -> wait R at position2? which is the same as above? Actually, wait: if R is at position 3? and A at position4? Then the word? 
Example: ""brace""? B (1), R (2), A (3), C (4), E (5) -> but that's R at 2 and A at 3? 

We need an example with R at 3 and A at 4? 
Like ""flare"": but flare has F, L, A, R, E -> positions: 
  flare: F(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> but R is at 4? we already know R isn't at position4? 

Other word: ""agree""? but agree has A at position1? which we know A isn't at position1? (from adore) -> rejected? 
Another: ""brave"": which was already tried? no? 
But ""brave"": B, R, A, V, E -> positions: R at 2? that's the same as above? 

Wait, I think it's hard? 

Actually, there is ""frame"": F, R, A, M, E -> positions: R at 2? again? 

What about ""grace"": G, R, A, C, E -> positions: R at 2? 

Possibly: ""graze""? It has S? no, Z -> ""graze"" has Z? But we don't know about Z? But note: we haven't ruled out Z? 

But we need R at 3? Let's think: 
  position1: ? 
  position2: some letter?
  position3: R?
  position4: A?
  position5: E

Words: ? 
  Like ""tare""? 4 letters? 

Five letter words: ""care""? 4 letters? 

Examples: 
  ""store""? but S is excluded? 
  ""shire""? S excluded? 

Actually, I cannot find a word with R at position3 and A at position4? But they exist? Such as ""opera"": but opera has O? excluded? 

Another: ""extra"": ends with A? not E? 

""aurae""? which might be not common? 

So perhaps the possibility is low? 

Since we are limited to a small set? 

But we have another option: R at position 3? A at position 4? 

But note: R cannot be at position 4? We tested in adore? So if R is at position 3? That's allowed? Then A at position 4? then word: _ _ R A E? 

Then what about position1 and position2? 

Example: ""brace""? that's 5 letter? B, R, A, C, E -> but R at position2? not at position3? 

To have R at position3: 
  position3: R? 
  position4: A? 

Then valid example: ""flare""? but as we noted ""flare"": positions: 
  F(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> Wait, A at 3? and R at4? But we want R at position3? 

We need R at position3 and A at position4? 

Example: ""opera"" -> O(1), P(2), E(3), R(4), A(5) -> doesn't end with E? 

Another: ""myrrh"" doesn't end with E? 

Actually, let's try: five letters: _ _ R A E -> but with E? The fifth letter is E? So the word pattern: X Y R A E? 

But ""? ? R A E"": any English words? 

Example: ""URAEM"" not valid? 

""grape""? G(1), R(2), A(3), P(4), E(5) -> again R at2? 

""trace"": T, R, A, C, E -> R at2? 

It appears that words with R at position3 and A at position4 and ending in E are rare? 

What about ""grave"": G, R, A, V, E -> R at2? 

So I think the pattern of _ _ R A E might not exist? Therefore, the more likely scenario is R at position2 and A at position3? 

Therefore, I'll guess a word with R at position2 and A at position3, ending in E? And avoid I, S, D, O? 

Therefore, ""crate"" is a candidate? C, R, A, T, E? 

We haven't tested position1. Position4: we haven't tested? 

Another candidate: ""great""? G, R, E, A, T -> doesn't end with E? 

""grade"": G, R, A, D, E -> but D is excluded? 

""graze"": G, R, A, Z, E -> avoids D,O,I,S? Z not tested? 
But ""graze"" is a word? 

But since D and O are excluded, we can include Z? 

Similarly, ""trace"": T, R, A, C, E -> C and T? 

But note: we don't know about T, C, and so on? 

So why not ""crate""? 

But also, ""brave"": B, R, A, V, E -> avoids I,S,D,O? 

So both ""brave"" and ""crate"" are candidates? 

Also, ""frate""? not a word? 

I think I'll choose ""brave"" because we haven't tested B or V? 

But ""crate"" has C and T? which are common? 

Alternatively, note that we have already tested: 
  raise: 5 letters
  adore: 5 letters

So the secret word must contain R and A and E? 

Also, it might contain two other letters? 

We need to test new letters? 

Therefore, let's choose ""brave"": 
  B: new
  R: at position 2 (untested? yes)
  A: at position 3 (untested? yes)
  V: new
  E: fixed at 5? 

But position4 in brave is V? 

If we guess and it's wrong? Then we get feedback on B, V? 

But we can also test for both possibilities? 

After thinking, let's go with ""brave""? 

Alternatively, a word that doesn't fix R and A? But we must fix? because the letter requirements? 

Actually, we must include R and A? And E? 

Also, avoid I,S,D,O? 

Thus, brave: B (new), R, A, V (new), E -> valid? 

Yes.

Therefore, new guess: brave

But let me confirm: 
  Position1: B? 
  Position2: R -> which we haven't tested? 
  Position3: A -> which we haven't tested? 
  Position4: V -> 
  Position5: E? 

If the secret word has A at position3 (if we are lucky) then we'd get A(✓)? 

Similarly, R if at position2? would be R(✓)? 

But note: we don't know if R is at position2? It could be at position3? then A must be at position4? and our guess brave? 
  Position3: A? -> if the secret has R at position2? then A might not at position3? then we get A(-)? 

But we are testing the hypothesis? 

Alternatively, a word that doesn't commit? But then we must include R and A? 

Another word: ""agree""? But A at position1? excluded? and also G? 

""price""? has I? excluded? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""brave"". 

So <guess>brave</guess>Based on previous feedback:  
- **E is fixed at position 5** in all guesses.  
- **R and A** must be in the word but **incorrectly positioned**:  
  - R: Cannot be pos1 (from ""raise"") or pos4 (from ""adore"") → must be pos2 or pos3.  
  - A: Cannot be pos2 (from ""raise"") or pos1 (from ""adore"") → must be pos3 or pos4.  
- **Eliminated letters**: I, S, D, O.  
- Remaining possibilities require testing R at pos2 ⚬, A at pos3 ⚬, and avoiding eliminated letters.  

Optimal guess: ""brave""  
- Tests R at pos2 and A at pos3 (untested positions).  
- Introduces new common consonants (B, V) for coverage.  
- Ends with E (✓).  
- Avoids I/S/D/O.",Guess 3: brave -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) V(x) E(✓),FAIL

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback so we need to make the first guess.
 Since there's no information, we should start with a word that has common letters and distinct letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in word games are often like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Considering that, I'll choose a word that has common vowels and consonants: ""RAISE""

 Why ""RAISE""?
 - It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
 - All letters are distinct, so we can get maximum information about five different letters.

 Therefore, I'll start with ""RAISE"".

 Let me output the guess accordingly.I'm making my first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I'll choose a common starting word that uses frequent letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Words like ""RAISE"" or ""CRANE"" are popular in word games because they cover multiple vowels and common consonants. 

For this first attempt, I'll select ""RAISE"":  
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)  
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of revealing useful clues about the secret word  

This sets a solid foundation for refining subsequent guesses based on feedback.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
 R -> (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 A -> (-) meaning A is in the word but in the wrong position.
 I -> (x) meaning I is not in the word.
 S -> (x) meaning S is not in the word.
 E -> (✓) meaning E is in the word and in the correct position (which is the fifth letter).

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"" (positions 1 and 2 respectively).
 - The secret word does not contain I or S.
 - The letter E is at the end (position 5) of the word.

 Since E is at the fifth position, the secret word ends with E.

 We must avoid using the letters I and S in future guesses.

 Also, note that R is in the word but not at position 1, and A is in the word but not at position 2.

 With these constraints, we think of a new word.

 Structure of the secret word: _ _ _ _ E

 We know the word has R and A, and the R cannot be at the start and A cannot be the second letter.

 We can consider common words ending in E. The fifth letter is fixed as E.

 Let's think of the positions for R and A. R is not at position 1, A is not at position 2.

 Also, note that the secret word is five letters and must include R, A and E (which we already have), and two other letters.

 Since we do not have any information about the middle letters, we can try a word that has R and A in different positions and avoids I and S.

 Possible positions for R: it could be in position 2,3,4? But note that position 1 is excluded because of the feedback. In our guess, R was at position 1 and feedback says it's not there, but it is present elsewhere.

 Similarly, A was at position 2 and feedback says it's present but not at position 2.

 So, in the new guess, we should put R at a position other than 1 (and also not positions where we've ruled out? Actually only position 1 is ruled out for R). For A, we must not put it at position 2.

 Let's aim to test new letters and try to place R and A in other positions to get more feedback.

 We can think of words ending with E and having R and A.

 Example words: 
 - carve? but we don't know if C, V are present.
 - aware: has A and R, ends with E. But note that A is at position 1 and R at position 3? 
   Also, we have to avoid S and I.

 Let's check ""aware"": 
   A, W, A, R, E -> but note: it has two A's, which might be okay.

 However, what about the constraints?
   The secret word has at least one A (since we got a minus for A). Our feedback for A specifically said it was present but not in position 2. Our first guess had A in position 2 and that was wrong.

 In ""aware"", the first letter is A. We don't know if A is in the word at position 1? It might be. Remember, the feedback for R (position 1 in first guess) was minus, meaning if we put A in position 1 that would be a different position. So it's allowed.

 Similarly, we are putting R in position 4? That wasn't tested before.

 But note: the secret word might have multiple letters? We don't know.

 However, we have only one R and one A indicated? Actually the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. So we cannot be sure.

 Given the constraint, we want to test a word that has:
   - E at the end (position 5) -> already set.
   - Includes R and A.
   - Avoids I and S.

 We also want to include as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Since the secret word has E at the end, we can try ""DANCE"" but DANCE has C which is new? But note we don't know if D, N, C are present. However, we must include R? Actually we must include R because we know it's in the word. So ""dance"" does not have R.

 Therefore, we need a word that has the letters R and A, and ends in E.

 Let's list some common words: 
   aware, argue, arose, arise -> but arise has S? (arise has S? a-r-i-s-e -> yes, but S was ruled out) so avoid arise.

 We know S is not in the word, so avoid words with S.

 Similarly, avoid I.

 So: 
   argue -> has U and G? but also E at end. And it has R and A? 
      argue: A (position 1), R (position 2), G, U, E -> but we have R at position 2? Remember feedback: R was not at position 1, but position 2 was not tested? Actually we tested R at position 1 and that was misplaced. Now if we test R at position 2, that might be correct? But we don't know.

 However, note the feedback about A: in the first guess A was at position 2 and was misplaced. So if the secret word had A at position 2, we would have gotten a check? Then that position for A is specifically wrong. But R at position 1 was wrong, but at position 2 might be okay? 

 Alternatively, let's try ""crane"" but note:
   crane: C,R,A,N,E -> but it has E at the end? Yes. But also we have S? No. However, we used ""raise"" and now we know I and S are not in the word. So we can't use crane because it includes R and A? Actually, it does include R and A. But note: we haven't used the letter C and N and also we avoid S and I.

 However, in ""crane"", R is at position 2 and A at position 3.

 But remember, in the first guess:
   R was at position 1 -> wrong position. So if the secret word has R at position 2? In ""crane"", if we put R at position 2 and if the secret word has R at position 2, we would get a check for R? 
   Similarly, A at position 3: we don't have feedback for that position.

 Also, E is at position 5 which we know is correct.

 So by trying ""crane"" we would test:
   C: new letter
   R: at position 2 -> if correct or wrong?
   A: at position 3 -> if correct or wrong?
   N: new letter
   E: known correct at position 5.

 That might be good because it tests the R at position 2 and A at position 3, and introduces C and N.

 But note: we have to avoid S and I? Crane has no S or I. Good.

 However, what if the secret word doesn't have C and N? Then we get x for them and we gain more information.

 Another possibility: ""drake"" -> D, R, A, K, E -> avoids S and I? Yes. Has R and A? Yes. Ends in E? Yes.

 In ""drake"", R is at position 2 and A at position 3? Same as crane.

 So let's choose a word that has R and A in positions we haven't tested? But we already know R can't be position 1 and A can't be position 2.

 How about we try a word with R at position 3 and A at position 4? 

 For example: ""opera"" -> o-p-e-r-a? That doesn't end with E? So not opera.

 Or ""lance"" -> has no R. Must include R.

 Or ""large"" -> letter L, A, R, G, E -> avoid S and I? Yes. 
   Large: L (1), A (2), R (3), G (4), E (5). 

 But note: in this word, 
   position 1: L -> new letter
   position 2: A -> but our feedback for A said it's not at position 2 (from the first guess). So if we put A at position 2, and if the secret word has A at position 2, we would get a check? But in our feedback, we put A at position 2 and got a minus? That means position 2 is wrong for A. So we cannot put A at position 2 again because we know it's not there.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 2? And similarly, we must avoid putting R at position 1? Yes.

 So we cannot guess ""aware"" because that puts A at position 1? Actually ""aware"" is a-w-a-r-e? Let me spell: ""aware"" is A (1), W (2), A (3), R (4), E (5). Note: two A's? 

 But the secret word may have two A's? We don't know. But in the first guess, we only had one A and got minus? Meaning that A is in the word but not in position 2. So one A is somewhere? It doesn't preclude two A's.

 However, if we put A at position 1 in ""aware"", that might be okay (if the secret word has A at position 1) or also at position 3? 

 But note: we need to test R in a new position? Previously we only tested it at position 1 and it was wrong. So we can test it at position 4? 

 Therefore, ""aware"" is a valid guess? Because:
   position 1: A -> untested for A? We only know A is not at position 2.
   position 2: W -> new letter.
   position 3: A -> but wait, we don't know if there are two A's? We simply test.
   position 4: R -> would test R at position 4? 
   position 5: E -> known.

 However, we have two A's? We don't know if the secret word has two A's? If it doesn't, then one of the A positions must match.

 But note: the secret word must have A exactly? Yes, at least one. So if we put two A's, it might mislead? Actually the feedback would mark only the A's appropriately.

 Alternatively, let's try a word with one A? But we want to maximize letter coverage.

 Another idea: we can use ""grave""? grave: G, R, A, V, E -> ends with E? yes. 
   positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:V, 5:E.

 Now, note that we are putting R at position 2? We don't know if it can be at position 2? 
   Previously R was at position 1 and misplaced -> so position 1 is wrong, but position 2 might be okay? 
 Similarly, we are putting A at position 3? We know it's not at position 2? Position 3 is new.

 Also, G and V are new.

 This seems good: we are testing R at position 2 and A at position 3? 

 But what if the secret word has A at position 3? Then we would get a check? Or if not? 

 Also, we avoid I and S? Yes.

 So let's consider ""grave"".

 However, note the feedback: we have E at the end? Yes.

 But what if the secret word doesn't have G or V? Then we get x for them.

 Alternatively, we might also consider ""price"" -> but we have I? We know I is not in the word? So avoid price? Yes, because it has I.

 Then ""grave"" seems acceptable.

 Let's think about ""crane"": 
   Crane: position1:C, position2:R, position3:A, position4:N, position5:E.
   Then:
      C: new -> we'll get feedback if present and position?
      R: position2 -> if the secret word has R at position2? 
      A: position3 -> if secret word has A at position3?
      N: new
      E: known.

 It's similar to grave? But has N instead of V.

 Since we want to maximize new letters? Both crane and grave introduce two new letters? And test R at 2 and A at 3? 

 But note: in the secret word, we don't know where A is? It could be at position 1? Or position 3? Or position 4?

 We might test R at position 4? We haven't tested that? 

 But in both crane and grave, we test R at 2. We want to get more positioning information? 

 Another word: ""parse"" -> but parse has S? Avoid since S is not in the word.

 Or ""barge"": B, A, R, G, E -> 
   positions: B (1), A (2), R (3), G (4), E (5) -> but note: A is at position2? We know that A cannot be at position 2 because in first guess we had A at position2 and it was minus? So we would be repeating a mistake? 

 Therefore, avoid putting A at position2.

 So in ""barge"", position2 is A -> so that's invalid? We know A is not at position2? So we shouldn't put it there again.

 Similarly, we must avoid putting A at position2? So we shouldn't do that.

 So ""aware"" is okay? Because in aware:
   A is at position1 and position3? and we are not putting it at position2? Position2 is W.

 Specifically:
   Position1: A -> this is a new position for A, which we haven't tested? (first guess tested A at position2) 
   Position2: W -> new
   Position3: A -> we are testing A again? But it's at position3? 
   Position4: R -> testing R at position4? 
   Position5: E

 So this tests:
   A at two positions: 1 and 3 (if the secret word has A at one of those, we'd get at least one minus? if both are wrong then both minuses? or if one matches, then a check? 
   Or in case of one occurrence? if the secret word has A only at position1, then the first A would be ✓ and the second A might be x if there's no duplicate? Actually, we are using double A? So the feedback might mark two A's? 

 But note: the feedback rule: 
   ✓ for correct position and letter.
   - for letter in word but not that position.
   x for not in word.

 But if the word has one A? Then in a guess with two A's? The rules in Wordle: 
   The feedback will assign one minus or check for each occurrence? Actually, the exact rule: 
      Each letter in the secret word is matched to the guess's letter at the same position? Then the remaining are matched? 

 But in detail: 
   The secret BRISK and guess STORM: 
        S (from guess) -> S is present? But in BRISK there's no S? So it's x? Actually the example shows S(-) -> wait no, let me see: 
        The example feedback for STORM on secret BRISK: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

        Actually, BRISK has S? no? So why is S(-)? 
        Wait, the example says ""Secret Word: BRISK"", which has S? B-R-I-S-K -> S is at position4? 

        So STORM -> 
          position1: S vs B -> S is in the word? (at position4) -> but not here? so minus
          position2: T vs R -> T not in word? x
          position3: O vs I -> not in word? x
          position4: R vs S -> R is in the word? but actually R is at position2? So for position4: we have R? but secret has S? -> S is at position4? Then R at position4: not S? so actually R is in the word but not at position4? But wait, R is already matched at position2? 

        How the feedback is generated?
          First, mark exact matches? None.
          Then, for non-matched letters in the guess, if there are non-matched same letters in the secret? So S in guess is at position1 -> secret has S at position4? non-matched? so minus? 
          Then R in guess at position4: secret has R? But secret R is at position2? which is unmatched? Then R would get a minus? 

        Similarly, T, O, M are not in secret? So x.

        So for two same letters? If there are two same A's? Then if both are correct? then both ✓? Or if one is correct? one ✓ and the other might be - if the other exists? 

 But we cannot assume duplicates? The secret word might have one R? or two? 

 Therefore, we must be cautious.

 For simplicity, we can avoid words with duplicate letters? So we can have distinct letters? 

 Then ""crane"" has no duplicates? And tests:
   position1: C -> new
   position2: R -> not tested at 2? (only at 1 tested - misplaced)
   position3: A -> not tested at 3? (only at 2 tested - misplaced)
   position4: N -> new
   position5: E -> known.

 Also, avoids I and S? Yes.

 Similarly, ""grave"" has distinct letters? Yes: G,R,A,V,E? 

 So both ""crane"" and ""grave"" are acceptable? 

 But note: we already tried ""raise"" and it used R,A,E? so ""crane"" uses R,A,E? which might be overlapping in letters? But the secret word might have more letters? So we don't know.

 Why not choose ""grave""? Or ""crane""?

 Alternatively, we can consider the frequency of letters? Let me think: 

   We have already tested: R, A, I, S, E -> so I and S are not there.

   Now, we want to test new common letters? 

   The most common letters usually: E, A, R, O, T, ... but note O hasn't been tested? 

   Crane has C, R, A, N, E -> R and A are known to be present? So we are testing C and N? 

   Grave has G, R, A, V, E -> testing G and V? 

   How common? 
      In English, N is more common than V? Also, C and G are similarly common? 

   Also, O and T might be good? 

   Therefore, another word like ""other"" -> ends with E? Wait, ""other"" doesn't end with E? 

   We need ending in E? 

   How about ""alone""? But wait, we must include R and A? Also, A at position2? We shouldn't put A at position2? Because we know it's not there.

   ""adore"" -> A at position1? Then D, O, R, E -> avoids position2 for A? And ends in E? 
       adore: A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), E(5) -> 
          A: now testing A at position1? 
          D: new
          O: new, common
          R: testing R at position4? 
          E: known.

      And avoids I and S? Yes.

      So ""adore"" is a good candidate? 

   Compare ""crane"" and ""adore""? 
        crane: tests R at position2 and A at position3? 
        adore: tests A at position1 and R at position4? 

      Which is better? 

      We know that R is not at position1? But it could be at position2? Or position4? 
      Similarly, A is not at position2? Could be at position1? Or position3? Or position4? 

      So testing different positions? 

      Also, adore uses D and O? which are popular? 

   Another candidate: ""opera"" doesn't end with E? 

   ""ample"" -> doesn't have R? 

   We definitely need to include R? We have to.

   Given these?

   Let me choose ""adore"" because it tests A at a new position (1) and R at a new position (4) and introduces D and O? common letters.

   So the new guess: ""adore""

   Alternatively, ""crane"" would test R at position2? We want to check if R is at position2? 

   Since we have limited guesses (6 total), we can only test one? 

   But whichever we choose? 

   I think both are reasonable? 

   Let me go with ""crane""? because it puts R and A both in the middle? 

   But note: the secret word might have R at position4? 

   Alternatively, ""ropey"" -> not a real word? Wait, let me stick to real words.

   After thinking, I choose ""adore"" because:

      We know E is at the end -> fixed.

      We are testing A at position1? If that's correct? then we get a check? which would be good? 
      We are testing R at position4? if that's correct? 

      Also, we are testing D and O? 

   Therefore, I'll guess ""adore"".

   So the word: adore

<guess>adore</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":  
- ✓ E is fixed at position 5.  
- ◊ R and A are in the secret word but incorrectly positioned (R cannot be at position 1, A cannot be at position 2).  
- ✗ I and S are eliminated.  

For the second guess:  
- Must include R and A while avoiding positions 1 for R and 2 for A.  
- Ends with E at position 5.  
- Tests new common letters (like O and D) for coverage.  
- ""adore"" fits:  
  - Tests A at position 1 (new position)  
  - Tests R at position 4 (untested position)  
  - Introduces new letters D (position 2) and O (position 3)  
  - Maintains E at position 5

<guess>adore</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: adore -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given cumulative feedback:

Guess 1: ""raise"" -> R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- R is in the word, but not in position 1.
- A is in the word, but not in position 2.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word and at position 5 (correct).

Guess 2: ""adore"" -> A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)
Meaning:
- A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- D is not in the word.
- O is not in the word.
- R is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E is confirmed at position 5.

Synthesis:
- E is fixed at position 5: the word has to be _ _ _ _ E
- Letters R and A are present, but they are not in the positions they were guessed: 
  - R: not at position 1 (from guess1) and not at position 4 (from guess2)
- A: not at position 2 (from guess1) and not at position 1 (from guess2)
- Letters I, S, D, O are absent.

Therefore, we know the word ends with E, contains R and A, and excludes I, S, D, O.

Now, we need to consider remaining positions for R and A:
- R must be in position 2, 3 or 5? But position 5 is E -> so positions 2 or 3.
- Similarly, A must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But E is at 5 -> so A at 3 or 4? But positions: 1,2,3,4 are free? Actually, position 5 is fixed as E.

We must re-check positions:
- Secret word: position 1: ?; position 2: ?; position 3: ?; position 4: ?; position 5: E

Constraints:
- A: cannot be position 1 (tested in adore) and not position 2 (tested in raise) -> so A must be in position 3 or 4.
- R: cannot be position 1 (tested in raise) and not position 4 (tested in adore) -> so R must be in position 2 or 3.

Possible conflicts? Position 3: might be both R or A? But it can only be one? So we must account.

Also, the word must be a 5-letter English word ending in E, with R and A, without I,S,D,O.

We need to consider other letters? We have tested: R, A, I, S, E, D, O, and Adore also used the letters A, D, O, R, E.

Thus, absent letters: I, S, D, O.

Now, what other letters could appear? We don't know? We have to guess letters not excluded.

Therefore, pick a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Includes R and A in the positions: 
  R: only allowed in 2 or 3? 
  A: only in 3 or 4.

But note: the positions for R and A might be the same if position 3? But if both are required? And if position 3? Then the other must be elsewhere? 

Actually, the positions for R and A must be different? Because they are two distinct letters? So:
- Option 1: R at position 2, then A at position 3 or 4? 
- Option 2: R at position 3, then A at position 4? (because position 2 is taken? if R at 3 then A must be at 4, because A cannot be at 1 or 2? and position 1 is the only other? but position 1 is free? but A cannot be at 1? and we already tested that).

Wait: 
- A cannot be at 1? Cannot be at 2? That leaves positions 3 and 4? 
- R cannot be at 1? Cannot be at 4? Which leaves positions 2 and 3.

Now common words ending in E? 

Case 1: R at position 2, A at position 3: then the word would be _ R A _ E? 
Example words: 
- crate: but T and C are allowed? But crate has C, R, A, T, E -> ends with E? 
  Position 2: R? fixed? 
  Position 3: A? fixed?
  Then positions 1: C and 4: T? 

But is C and T present? We don't know? 

If we guess ""crate"", then:
  C: new letter?
  R: at position 2? which we haven't tested? 
  A: at position 3? which we haven't tested?
  T: new letter?
  E: known.

And check the constraints? We avoid I,S,D,O? crate has C, R, A, T, E -> none of I,S,D,O? so acceptable.

But note: what about the possibility of R at position 3 and A at position 4? Then the word is _ _ R A E? 
Example: ""trace"": but trace has T, R, A, C, E -> positions: T(1), R(2) -> wait R at position2? which is the same as above? Actually, wait: if R is at position 3? and A at position4? Then the word? 
Example: ""brace""? B (1), R (2), A (3), C (4), E (5) -> but that's R at 2 and A at 3? 

We need an example with R at 3 and A at 4? 
Like ""flare"": but flare has F, L, A, R, E -> positions: 
  flare: F(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> but R is at 4? we already know R isn't at position4? 

Other word: ""agree""? but agree has A at position1? which we know A isn't at position1? (from adore) -> rejected? 
Another: ""brave"": which was already tried? no? 
But ""brave"": B, R, A, V, E -> positions: R at 2? that's the same as above? 

Wait, I think it's hard? 

Actually, there is ""frame"": F, R, A, M, E -> positions: R at 2? again? 

What about ""grace"": G, R, A, C, E -> positions: R at 2? 

Possibly: ""graze""? It has S? no, Z -> ""graze"" has Z? But we don't know about Z? But note: we haven't ruled out Z? 

But we need R at 3? Let's think: 
  position1: ? 
  position2: some letter?
  position3: R?
  position4: A?
  position5: E

Words: ? 
  Like ""tare""? 4 letters? 

Five letter words: ""care""? 4 letters? 

Examples: 
  ""store""? but S is excluded? 
  ""shire""? S excluded? 

Actually, I cannot find a word with R at position3 and A at position4? But they exist? Such as ""opera"": but opera has O? excluded? 

Another: ""extra"": ends with A? not E? 

""aurae""? which might be not common? 

So perhaps the possibility is low? 

Since we are limited to a small set? 

But we have another option: R at position 3? A at position 4? 

But note: R cannot be at position 4? We tested in adore? So if R is at position 3? That's allowed? Then A at position 4? then word: _ _ R A E? 

Then what about position1 and position2? 

Example: ""brace""? that's 5 letter? B, R, A, C, E -> but R at position2? not at position3? 

To have R at position3: 
  position3: R? 
  position4: A? 

Then valid example: ""flare""? but as we noted ""flare"": positions: 
  F(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> Wait, A at 3? and R at4? But we want R at position3? 

We need R at position3 and A at position4? 

Example: ""opera"" -> O(1), P(2), E(3), R(4), A(5) -> doesn't end with E? 

Another: ""myrrh"" doesn't end with E? 

Actually, let's try: five letters: _ _ R A E -> but with E? The fifth letter is E? So the word pattern: X Y R A E? 

But ""? ? R A E"": any English words? 

Example: ""URAEM"" not valid? 

""grape""? G(1), R(2), A(3), P(4), E(5) -> again R at2? 

""trace"": T, R, A, C, E -> R at2? 

It appears that words with R at position3 and A at position4 and ending in E are rare? 

What about ""grave"": G, R, A, V, E -> R at2? 

So I think the pattern of _ _ R A E might not exist? Therefore, the more likely scenario is R at position2 and A at position3? 

Therefore, I'll guess a word with R at position2 and A at position3, ending in E? And avoid I, S, D, O? 

Therefore, ""crate"" is a candidate? C, R, A, T, E? 

We haven't tested position1. Position4: we haven't tested? 

Another candidate: ""great""? G, R, E, A, T -> doesn't end with E? 

""grade"": G, R, A, D, E -> but D is excluded? 

""graze"": G, R, A, Z, E -> avoids D,O,I,S? Z not tested? 
But ""graze"" is a word? 

But since D and O are excluded, we can include Z? 

Similarly, ""trace"": T, R, A, C, E -> C and T? 

But note: we don't know about T, C, and so on? 

So why not ""crate""? 

But also, ""brave"": B, R, A, V, E -> avoids I,S,D,O? 

So both ""brave"" and ""crate"" are candidates? 

Also, ""frate""? not a word? 

I think I'll choose ""brave"" because we haven't tested B or V? 

But ""crate"" has C and T? which are common? 

Alternatively, note that we have already tested: 
  raise: 5 letters
  adore: 5 letters

So the secret word must contain R and A and E? 

Also, it might contain two other letters? 

We need to test new letters? 

Therefore, let's choose ""brave"": 
  B: new
  R: at position 2 (untested? yes)
  A: at position 3 (untested? yes)
  V: new
  E: fixed at 5? 

But position4 in brave is V? 

If we guess and it's wrong? Then we get feedback on B, V? 

But we can also test for both possibilities? 

After thinking, let's go with ""brave""? 

Alternatively, a word that doesn't fix R and A? But we must fix? because the letter requirements? 

Actually, we must include R and A? And E? 

Also, avoid I,S,D,O? 

Thus, brave: B (new), R, A, V (new), E -> valid? 

Yes.

Therefore, new guess: brave

But let me confirm: 
  Position1: B? 
  Position2: R -> which we haven't tested? 
  Position3: A -> which we haven't tested? 
  Position4: V -> 
  Position5: E? 

If the secret word has A at position3 (if we are lucky) then we'd get A(✓)? 

Similarly, R if at position2? would be R(✓)? 

But note: we don't know if R is at position2? It could be at position3? then A must be at position4? and our guess brave? 
  Position3: A? -> if the secret has R at position2? then A might not at position3? then we get A(-)? 

But we are testing the hypothesis? 

Alternatively, a word that doesn't commit? But then we must include R and A? 

Another word: ""agree""? But A at position1? excluded? and also G? 

""price""? has I? excluded? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""brave"". 

So <guess>brave</guess>Based on previous feedback:  
- **E is fixed at position 5** in all guesses.  
- **R and A** must be in the word but **incorrectly positioned**:  
  - R: Cannot be pos1 (from ""raise"") or pos4 (from ""adore"") → must be pos2 or pos3.  
  - A: Cannot be pos2 (from ""raise"") or pos1 (from ""adore"") → must be pos3 or pos4.  
- **Eliminated letters**: I, S, D, O.  
- Remaining possibilities require testing R at pos2 ⚬, A at pos3 ⚬, and avoiding eliminated letters.  

Optimal guess: ""brave""  
- Tests R at pos2 and A at pos3 (untested positions).  
- Introduces new common consonants (B, V) for coverage.  
- Ends with E (✓).  
- Avoids I/S/D/O.

R is not at position 1, A is not at position 2.\n\n Also, note that the secret word is five letters and must include R, A and E (which we already have), and two other letters.\n\n Since we do not have any information about the middle letters, we can try a word that has R and A in different positions and avoids I and S.\n\n Possible positions for R: it could be in position 2,3,4? But note that position 1 is excluded because of the feedback. In our guess, R was at position 1 and feedback says it\'s not there, but it is present elsewhere.\n\n Similarly, A was at position 2 and feedback says it\'s present but not at position 2.\n\n So, in the new guess, we should put R at a position other than 1 (and also not positions where we\'ve ruled out? Actually only position 1 is ruled out for R). For A, we must not put it at position 2.\n\n Let\'s aim to test new letters and try to place R and A in other positions to get more feedback.\n\n We can think of words ending with E and having R and A.\n\n Example words: \n - carve? but we don\'t know if C, V are present.\n - aware: has A and R, ends with E. But note that A is at position 1 and R at position 3? \n   Also, we have to avoid S and I.\n\n Let\'s check ""aware"": \n   A, W, A, R, E -> but note: it has two A\'s, which might be okay.\n\n However, what about the constraints?\n   The secret word has at least one A (since we got a minus for A). Our feedback for A specifically said it was present but not in position 2. Our first guess had A in position 2 and that was wrong.\n\n In ""aware"", the first letter is A. We don\'t know if A is in the word at position 1? It might be. Remember, the feedback for R (position 1 in first guess) was minus, meaning if we put A in position 1 that would be a different position. So it\'s allowed.\n\n Similarly, we are putting R in position 4? That wasn\'t tested before.\n\n But note: the secret word might have multiple letters? We don\'t know.\n\n However, we have only one R and one A indicated? Actually the feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are duplicates. So we cannot be sure.\n\n Given the constraint, we want to test a word that has:\n   - E at the end (position 5) -> already set.\n   - Includes R and A.\n   - Avoids I and S.\n\n We also want to include as many new letters as possible to get more information.\n\n Since the secret word has E at the end, we can try ""DANCE"" but DANCE has C which is new? But note we don\'t know if D, N, C are present. However, we must include R? Actually we must include R because we know it\'s in the word. So ""dance"" does not have R.\n\n Therefore, we need a word that has the letters R and A, and ends in E.\n\n Let\'s list some common words: \n   aware, argue, arose, arise -> but arise has S? (arise has S? a-r-i-s-e -> yes, but S was ruled out) so avoid arise.\n\n We know S is not in the word, so avoid words with S.\n\n Similarly, avoid I.\n\n So: \n   argue -> has U and G? but also E at end. And it has R and A? \n      argue: A (position 1), R (position 2), G, U, E -> but we have R at position 2? Remember feedback: R was not at position 1, but position 2 was not tested? Actually we tested R at position 1 and that was misplaced. Now if we test R at position 2, that might be correct? But we don\'t know.\n\n However, note the feedback about A: in the first guess A was at position 2 and was misplaced. So if the secret word had A at position 2, we would have gotten a check? Then that position for A is specifically wrong. But R at position 1 was wrong, but at position 2 might be okay? \n\n Alternatively, let\'s try ""crane"" but note:\n   crane: C,R,A,N,E -> but it has E at the end? Yes. But also we have S? No. However, we used ""raise"" and now we know I and S are not in the word. So we can\'t use crane because it includes R and A? Actually, it does include R and A. But note: we haven\'t used the letter C and N and also we avoid S and I.\n\n However, in ""crane"", R is at position 2 and A at position 3.\n\n But remember, in the first guess:\n   R was at position 1 -> wrong position. So if the secret word has R at position 2? In ""crane"", if we put R at position 2 and if the secret word has R at position 2, we would get a check for R? \n   Similarly, A at position 3: we don\'t have feedback for that position.\n\n Also, E is at position 5 which we know is correct.\n\n So by trying ""crane"" we would test:\n   C: new letter\n   R: at position 2 -> if correct or wrong?\n   A: at position 3 -> if correct or wrong?\n   N: new letter\n   E: known correct at position 5.\n\n That might be good because it tests the R at position 2 and A at position 3, and introduces C and N.\n\n But note: we have to avoid S and I? Crane has no S or I. Good.\n\n However, what if the secret word doesn\'t have C and N? Then we get x for them and we gain more information.\n\n Another possibility: ""drake"" -> D, R, A, K, E -> avoids S and I? Yes. Has R and A? Yes. Ends in E? Yes.\n\n In ""drake"", R is at position 2 and A at position 3? Same as crane.\n\n So let\'s choose a word that has R and A in positions we haven\'t tested? But we already know R can\'t be position 1 and A can\'t be position 2.\n\n How about we try a word with R at position 3 and A at position 4? \n\n For example: ""opera"" -> o-p-e-r-a? That doesn\'t end with E? So not opera.\n\n Or ""lance"" -> has no R. Must include R.\n\n Or ""large"" -> letter L, A, R, G, E -> avoid S and I? Yes. \n   Large: L (1), A (2), R (3), G (4), E (5). \n\n But note: in this word, \n   position 1: L -> new letter\n   position 2: A -> but our feedback for A said it\'s not at position 2 (from the first guess). So if we put A at position 2, and if the secret word has A at position 2, we would get a check? But in our feedback, we put A at position 2 and got a minus? That means position 2 is wrong for A. So we cannot put A at position 2 again because we know it\'s not there.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 2? And similarly, we must avoid putting R at position 1? Yes.\n\n So we cannot guess ""aware"" because that puts A at position 1? Actually ""aware"" is a-w-a-r-e? Let me spell: ""aware"" is A (1), W (2), A (3), R (4), E (5). Note: two A\'s? \n\n But the secret word may have two A\'s? We don\'t know. But in the first guess, we only had one A and got minus? Meaning that A is in the word but not in position 2. So one A is somewhere? It doesn\'t preclude two A\'s.\n\n However, if we put A at position 1 in ""aware"", that might be okay (if the secret word has A at position 1) or also at position 3? \n\n But note: we need to test R in a new position? Previously we only tested it at position 1 and it was wrong. So we can test it at position 4? \n\n Therefore, ""aware"" is a valid guess? Because:\n   position 1: A -> untested for A? We only know A is not at position 2.\n   position 2: W -> new letter.\n   position 3: A -> but wait, we don\'t know if there are two A\'s? We simply test.\n   position 4: R -> would test R at position 4? \n   position 5: E -> known.\n\n However, we have two A\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? If it doesn\'t, then one of the A positions must match.\n\n But note: the secret word must have A exactly? Yes, at least one. So if we put two A\'s, it might mislead? Actually the feedback would mark only the A\'s appropriately.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s try a word with one A? But we want to maximize letter coverage.\n\n Another idea: we can use ""grave""? grave: G, R, A, V, E -> ends with E? yes. \n   positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:V, 5:E.\n\n Now, note that we are putting R at position 2? We don\'t know if it can be at position 2? \n   Previously R was at position 1 and misplaced -> so position 1 is wrong, but position 2 might be okay? \n Similarly, we are putting A at position 3? We know it\'s not at position 2? Position 3 is new.\n\n Also, G and V are new.\n\n This seems good: we are testing R at position 2 and A at position 3? \n\n But what if the secret word has A at position 3? Then we would get a check? Or if not? \n\n Also, we avoid I and S? Yes.\n\n So let\'s consider ""grave"".\n\n However, note the feedback: we have E at the end? Yes.\n\n But what if the secret word doesn\'t have G or V? Then we get x for them.\n\n Alternatively, we might also consider ""price"" -> but we have I? We know I is not in the word? So avoid price? Yes, because it has I.\n\n Then ""grave"" seems acceptable.\n\n Let\'s think about ""crane"": \n   Crane: position1:C, position2:R, position3:A, position4:N, position5:E.\n   Then:\n      C: new -> we\'ll get feedback if present and position?\n      R: position2 -> if the secret word has R at position2? \n      A: position3 -> if secret word has A at position3?\n      N: new\n      E: known.\n\n It\'s similar to grave? But has N instead of V.\n\n Since we want to maximize new letters? Both crane and grave introduce two new letters? And test R at 2 and A at 3? \n\n But note: in the secret word, we don\'t know where A is? It could be at position 1? Or position 3? Or position 4?\n\n We might test R at position 4? We haven\'t tested that? \n\n But in both crane and grave, we test R at 2. We want to get more positioning information? \n\n Another word: ""parse"" -> but parse has S? Avoid since S is not in the word.\n\n Or ""barge"": B, A, R, G, E -> \n   positions: B (1), A (2), R (3), G (4), E (5) -> but note: A is at position2? We know that A cannot be at position 2 because in first guess we had A at position2 and it was minus? So we would be repeating a mistake? \n\n Therefore, avoid putting A at position2.\n\n So in ""barge"", position2 is A -> so that\'s invalid? We know A is not at position2? So we shouldn\'t put it there again.\n\n Similarly, we must avoid putting A at position2? So we shouldn\'t do that.\n\n So ""aware"" is okay? Because in aware:\n   A is at position1 and position3? and we are not putting it at position2? Position2 is W.\n\n Specifically:\n   Position1: A -> this is a new position for A, which we haven\'t tested? (first guess tested A at position2) \n   Position2: W -> new\n   Position3: A -> we are testing A again? But it\'s at position3? \n   Position4: R -> testing R at position4? \n   Position5: E\n\n So this tests:\n   A at two positions: 1 and 3 (if the secret word has A at one of those, we\'d get at least one minus? if both are wrong then both minuses? or if one matches, then a check? \n   Or in case of one occurrence? if the secret word has A only at position1, then the first A would be ✓ and the second A might be x if there\'s no duplicate? Actually, we are using double A? So the feedback might mark two A\'s? \n\n But note: the feedback rule: \n   ✓ for correct position and letter.\n   - for letter in word but not that position.\n   x for not in word.\n\n But if the word has one A? Then in a guess with two A\'s? The rules in Wordle: \n   The feedback will assign one minus or check for each occurrence? Actually, the exact rule: \n      Each letter in the secret word is matched to the guess\'s letter at the same position? Then the remaining are matched? \n\n But in detail: \n   The secret BRISK and guess STORM: \n        S (from guess) -> S is present? But in BRISK there\'s no S? So it\'s x? Actually the example shows S(-) -> wait no, let me see: \n        The example feedback for STORM on secret BRISK: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)\n\n        Actually, BRISK has S? no? So why is S(-)? \n        Wait, the example says ""Secret Word: BRISK"", which has S? B-R-I-S-K -> S is at position4? \n\n        So STORM -> \n          position1: S vs B -> S is in the word? (at position4) -> but not here? so minus\n          position2: T vs R -> T not in word? x\n          position3: O vs I -> not in word? x\n          position4: R vs S -> R is in the word? but actually R is at position2? So for position4: we have R? but secret has S? -> S is at position4? Then R at position4: not S? so actually R is in the word but not at position4? But wait, R is already matched at position2? \n\n        How the feedback is generated?\n          First, mark exact matches? None.\n          Then, for non-matched letters in the guess, if there are non-matched same letters in the secret? So S in guess is at position1 -> secret has S at position4? non-matched? so minus? \n          Then R in guess at position4: secret has R? But secret R is at position2? which is unmatched? Then R would get a minus? \n\n        Similarly, T, O, M are not in secret? So x.\n\n        So for two same letters? If there are two same A\'s? Then if both are correct? then both ✓? Or if one is correct? one ✓ and the other might be - if the other exists? \n\n But we cannot assume duplicates? The secret word might have one R? or two? \n\n Therefore, we must be cautious.\n\n For simplicity, we can avoid words with duplicate letters? So we can have distinct letters? \n\n Then ""crane"" has no duplicates? And tests:\n   position1: C -> new\n   position2: R -> not tested at 2? (only at 1 tested - misplaced)\n   position3: A -> not tested at 3? (only at 2 tested - misplaced)\n   position4: N -> new\n   position5: E -> known.\n\n Also, avoids I and S? Yes.\n\n Similarly, ""grave"" has distinct letters? Yes: G,R,A,V,E? \n\n So both ""crane"" and ""grave"" are acceptable? \n\n But note: we already tried ""raise"" and it used R,A,E? so ""crane"" uses R,A,E? which might be overlapping in letters? But the secret word might have more letters? So we don\'t know.\n\n Why not choose ""grave""? Or ""crane""?\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the frequency of letters? Let me think: \n\n   We have already tested: R, A, I, S, E -> so I and S are not there.\n\n   Now, we want to test new common letters? \n\n   The most common letters usually: E, A, R, O, T, ... but note O hasn\'t been tested? \n\n   Crane has C, R, A, N, E -> R and A are known to be present? So we are testing C and N? \n\n   Grave has G, R, A, V, E -> testing G and V? \n\n   How common? \n      In English, N is more common than V? Also, C and G are similarly common? \n\n   Also, O and T might be good? \n\n   Therefore, another word like ""other"" -> ends with E? Wait, ""other"" doesn\'t end with E? \n\n   We need ending in E? \n\n   How about ""alone""? But wait, we must include R and A? Also, A at position2? We shouldn\'t put A at position2? Because we know it\'s not there.\n\n   ""adore"" -> A at position1? Then D, O, R, E -> avoids position2 for A? And ends in E? \n       adore: A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), E(5) -> \n          A: now testing A at position1? \n          D: new\n          O: new, common\n          R: testing R at position4? \n          E: known.\n\n      And avoids I and S? Yes.\n\n      So ""adore"" is a good candidate? \n\n   Compare ""crane"" and ""adore""? \n        crane: tests R at position2 and A at position3? \n        adore: tests A at position1 and R at position4? \n\n      Which is better? \n\n      We know that R is not at position1? But it could be at position2? Or position4? \n      Similarly, A is not at position2? Could be at position1? Or position3? Or position4? \n\n      So testing different positions? \n\n      Also, adore uses D and O? which are popular? \n\n   Another candidate: ""opera"" doesn\'t end with E? \n\n   ""ample"" -> doesn\'t have R? \n\n   We definitely need to include R? We have to.\n\n   Given these?\n\n   Let me choose ""adore"" because it tests A at a new position (1) and R at a new position (4) and introduces D and O? common letters.\n\n   So the new guess: ""adore""\n\n   Alternatively, ""crane"" would test R at position2? We want to check if R is at position2? \n\n   Since we have limited guesses (6 total), we can only test one? \n\n   But whichever we choose? \n\n   I think both are reasonable? \n\n   Let me go with ""crane""? because it puts R and A both in the middle? \n\n   But note: the secret word might have R at position4? \n\n   Alternatively, ""ropey"" -> not a real word? Wait, let me stick to real words.\n\n   After thinking, I choose ""adore"" because:\n\n      We know E is at the end -> fixed.\n\n      We are testing A at position1? If that\'s correct? then we get a check? which would be good? \n      We are testing R at position4? if that\'s correct? \n\n      Also, we are testing D and O? \n\n   Therefore, I\'ll guess ""adore"".\n\n   So the word: adore\n\n<guess>adore</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":  \n- ✓ E is fixed at position 5.  \n- ◊ R and A are in the secret word but incorrectly positioned (R cannot be at position 1, A cannot be at position 2).  \n- ✗ I and S are eliminated.  \n\nFor the second guess:  \n- Must include R and A while avoiding positions 1 for R and 2 for A.  \n- Ends with E at position 5.  \n- Tests new common letters (like O and D) for coverage.  \n- ""adore"" fits:  \n  - Tests A at position 1 (new position)  \n  - Tests R at position 4 (untested position)  \n  - Introduces new letters D (position 2) and O (position 3)  \n  - Maintains E at position 5\n\n<guess>adore</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: adore -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given cumulative feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""raise"" -> R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the word, but not in position 1.\n- A is in the word, but not in position 2.\n- I is not in the word.\n- S is not in the word.\n- E is in the word and at position 5 (correct).\n\nGuess 2: ""adore"" -> A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- A is in the word, but not in position 1.\n- D is not in the word.\n- O is not in the word.\n- R is in the word, but not in position 4.\n- E is confirmed at position 5.\n\nSynthesis:\n- E is fixed at position 5: the word has to be _ _ _ _ E\n- Letters R and A are present, but they are not in the positions they were guessed: \n  - R: not at position 1 (from guess1) and not at position 4 (from guess2)\n- A: not at position 2 (from guess1) and not at position 1 (from guess2)\n- Letters I, S, D, O are absent.\n\nTherefore, we know the word ends with E, contains R and A, and excludes I, S, D, O.\n\nNow, we need to consider remaining positions for R and A:\n- R must be in position 2, 3 or 5? But position 5 is E -> so positions 2 or 3.\n- Similarly, A must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But E is at 5 -> so A at 3 or 4? But positions: 1,2,3,4 are free? Actually, position 5 is fixed as E.\n\nWe must re-check positions:\n- Secret word: position 1: ?; position 2: ?; position 3: ?; position 4: ?; position 5: E\n\nConstraints:\n- A: cannot be position 1 (tested in adore) and not position 2 (tested in raise) -> so A must be in position 3 or 4.\n- R: cannot be position 1 (tested in raise) and not position 4 (tested in adore) -> so R must be in position 2 or 3.\n\nPossible conflicts? Position 3: might be both R or A? But it can only be one? So we must account.\n\nAlso, the word must be a 5-letter English word ending in E, with R and A, without I,S,D,O.\n\nWe need to consider other letters? We have tested: R, A, I, S, E, D, O, and Adore also used the letters A, D, O, R, E.\n\nThus, absent letters: I, S, D, O.\n\nNow, what other letters could appear? We don\'t know? We have to guess letters not excluded.\n\nTherefore, pick a word that:\n- Ends in E.\n- Includes R and A in the positions: \n  R: only allowed in 2 or 3? \n  A: only in 3 or 4.\n\nBut note: the positions for R and A might be the same if position 3? But if both are required? And if position 3? Then the other must be elsewhere? \n\nActually, the positions for R and A must be different? Because they are two distinct letters? So:\n- Option 1: R at position 2, then A at position 3 or 4? \n- Option 2: R at position 3, then A at position 4? (because position 2 is taken? if R at 3 then A must be at 4, because A cannot be at 1 or 2? and position 1 is the only other? but position 1 is free? but A cannot be at 1? and we already tested that).\n\nWait: \n- A cannot be at 1? Cannot be at 2? That leaves positions 3 and 4? \n- R cannot be at 1? Cannot be at 4? Which leaves positions 2 and 3.\n\nNow common words ending in E? \n\nCase 1: R at position 2, A at position 3: then the word would be _ R A _ E? \nExample words: \n- crate: but T and C are allowed? But crate has C, R, A, T, E -> ends with E? \n  Position 2: R? fixed? \n  Position 3: A? fixed?\n  Then positions 1: C and 4: T? \n\nBut is C and T present? We don\'t know? \n\nIf we guess ""crate"", then:\n  C: new letter?\n  R: at position 2? which we haven\'t tested? \n  A: at position 3? which we haven\'t tested?\n  T: new letter?\n  E: known.\n\nAnd check the constraints? We avoid I,S,D,O? crate has C, R, A, T, E -> none of I,S,D,O? so acceptable.\n\nBut note: what about the possibility of R at position 3 and A at position 4? Then the word is _ _ R A E? \nExample: ""trace"": but trace has T, R, A, C, E -> positions: T(1), R(2) -> wait R at position2? which is the same as above? Actually, wait: if R is at position 3? and A at position4? Then the word? \nExample: ""brace""? B (1), R (2), A (3), C (4), E (5) -> but that\'s R at 2 and A at 3? \n\nWe need an example with R at 3 and A at 4? \nLike ""flare"": but flare has F, L, A, R, E -> positions: \n  flare: F(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> but R is at 4? we already know R isn\'t at position4? \n\nOther word: ""agree""? but agree has A at position1? which we know A isn\'t at position1? (from adore) -> rejected? \nAnother: ""brave"": which was already tried? no? \nBut ""brave"": B, R, A, V, E -> positions: R at 2? that\'s the same as above? \n\nWait, I think it\'s hard? \n\nActually, there is ""frame"": F, R, A, M, E -> positions: R at 2? again? \n\nWhat about ""grace"": G, R, A, C, E -> positions: R at 2? \n\nPossibly: ""graze""? It has S? no, Z -> ""graze"" has Z? But we don\'t know about Z? But note: we haven\'t ruled out Z? \n\nBut we need R at 3? Let\'s think: \n  position1: ? \n  position2: some letter?\n  position3: R?\n  position4: A?\n  position5: E\n\nWords: ? \n  Like ""tare""? 4 letters? \n\nFive letter words: ""care""? 4 letters? \n\nExamples: \n  ""store""? but S is excluded? \n  ""shire""? S excluded? \n\nActually, I cannot find a word with R at position3 and A at position4? But they exist? Such as ""opera"": but opera has O? excluded? \n\nAnother: ""extra"": ends with A? not E? \n\n""aurae""? which might be not common? \n\nSo perhaps the possibility is low? \n\nSince we are limited to a small set? \n\nBut we have another option: R at position 3? A at position 4? \n\nBut note: R cannot be at position 4? We tested in adore? So if R is at position 3? That\'s allowed? Then A at position 4? then word: _ _ R A E? \n\nThen what about position1 and position2? \n\nExample: ""brace""? that\'s 5 letter? B, R, A, C, E -> but R at position2? not at position3? \n\nTo have R at position3: \n  position3: R? \n  position4: A? \n\nThen valid example: ""flare""? but as we noted ""flare"": positions: \n  F(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> Wait, A at 3? and R at4? But we want R at position3? \n\nWe need R at position3 and A at position4? \n\nExample: ""opera"" -> O(1), P(2), E(3), R(4), A(5) -> doesn\'t end with E? \n\nAnother: ""myrrh"" doesn\'t end with E? \n\nActually, let\'s try: five letters: _ _ R A E -> but with E? The fifth letter is E? So the word pattern: X Y R A E? \n\nBut ""? ? R A E"": any English words? \n\nExample: ""URAEM"" not valid? \n\n""grape""? G(1), R(2), A(3), P(4), E(5) -> again R at2? \n\n""trace"": T, R, A, C, E -> R at2? \n\nIt appears that words with R at position3 and A at position4 and ending in E are rare? \n\nWhat about ""grave"": G, R, A, V, E -> R at2? \n\nSo I think the pattern of _ _ R A E might not exist? Therefore, the more likely scenario is R at position2 and A at position3? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess a word with R at position2 and A at position3, ending in E? And avoid I, S, D, O? \n\nTherefore, ""crate"" is a candidate? C, R, A, T, E? \n\nWe haven\'t tested position1. Position4: we haven\'t tested? \n\nAnother candidate: ""great""? G, R, E, A, T -> doesn\'t end with E? \n\n""grade"": G, R, A, D, E -> but D is excluded? \n\n""graze"": G, R, A, Z, E -> avoids D,O,I,S? Z not tested? \nBut ""graze"" is a word? \n\nBut since D and O are excluded, we can include Z? \n\nSimilarly, ""trace"": T, R, A, C, E -> C and T? \n\nBut note: we don\'t know about T, C, and so on? \n\nSo why not ""crate""? \n\nBut also, ""brave"": B, R, A, V, E -> avoids I,S,D,O? \n\nSo both ""brave"" and ""crate"" are candidates? \n\nAlso, ""frate""? not a word? \n\nI think I\'ll choose ""brave"" because we haven\'t tested B or V? \n\nBut ""crate"" has C and T? which are common? \n\nAlternatively, note that we have already tested: \n  raise: 5 letters\n  adore: 5 letters\n\nSo the secret word must contain R and A and E? \n\nAlso, it might contain two other letters? \n\nWe need to test new letters? \n\nTherefore, let\'s choose ""brave"": \n  B: new\n  R: at position 2 (untested? yes)\n  A: at position 3 (untested? yes)\n  V: new\n  E: fixed at 5? \n\nBut position4 in brave is V? \n\nIf we guess and it\'s wrong? Then we get feedback on B, V? \n\nBut we can also test for both possibilities? \n\nAfter thinking, let\'s go with ""brave""? \n\nAlternatively, a word that doesn\'t fix R and A? But we must fix? because the letter requirements? \n\nActually, we must include R and A? And E? \n\nAlso, avoid I,S,D,O? \n\nThus, brave: B (new), R, A, V (new), E -> valid? \n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, new guess: brave\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  Position1: B? \n  Position2: R -> which we haven\'t tested? \n  Position3: A -> which we haven\'t tested? \n  Position4: V -> \n  Position5: E? \n\nIf the secret word has A at position3 (if we are lucky) then we\'d get A(✓)? \n\nSimilarly, R if at position2? would be R(✓)? \n\nBut note: we don\'t know if R is at position2? It could be at position3? then A must be at position4? and our guess brave? \n  Position3: A? -> if the secret has R at position2? then A might not at position3? then we get A(-)? \n\nBut we are testing the hypothesis? \n\nAlternatively, a word that doesn\'t commit? But then we must include R and A? \n\nAnother word: ""agree""? But A at position1? excluded? and also G? \n\n""price""? has I? excluded? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""brave"". \n\nSo <guess>brave</guess>Based on previous feedback:  \n- **E is fixed at position 5** in all guesses.  \n- **R and A** must be in the word but **incorrectly positioned**:  \n  - R: Cannot be pos1 (from ""raise"") or pos4 (from ""adore"") → must be pos2 or pos3.  \n  - A: Cannot be pos2 (from ""raise"") or pos1 (from ""adore"") → must be pos3 or pos4.  \n- **Eliminated letters**: I, S, D, O.  \n- Remaining possibilities require testing R at pos2 ⚬, A at pos3 ⚬, and avoiding eliminated letters.  \n\nOptimal guess: ""brave""  \n- Tests R at pos2 and A at pos3 (untested positions).  \n- Introduces new common consonants (B, V) for coverage.  \n- Ends with E (✓).  \n- Avoids I/S/D/O.\n\n<guess>brave</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: adore -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)\nGuess 3: brave -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) V(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from Guess 3: brave -> B(x) R(✓) A(✓) V(x) E(✓)
 This means:
   B is not in the word (x)
   R is in the correct position (position 2? because in brave, R is at position 2) so R is the second letter of the secret word.
   A is in the correct position (position 3? because in brave, A is at position 3) so A is the third letter of the secret word.
   V is not in the word (x)
   E is at the end (position 5) which we already knew.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R A _ E

 And we know the word does not contain B, V, I, S, D, O (from previous feedback).

 Also, note that we have E at the end? Yes.

 Now, we know two more positions: R at position 2, and A at position 3? So the word is ? R A ? E

 We need to fill in the first and fourth positions? 

 But also note: from Guess 1: ""raise"" gave us that R was present but not at position 1? Well, now we know it is at position 2? So that matches.

 And from Guess 1: A was present but not at position 2? Now we have it at position 3? So consistent.

 Now, what letters can we use? 
   We must avoid: I, S, D, O, B, V? 

 And not all letters are ruled out? 

 We need to find a 5-letter English word of the form _ R A _ E? and avoiding the above letters? and also must be valid.

 Common words: 
   ""grace""? G (position1) and C (position4) -> ends with E? 
   ""trace"": T R A C E? 
   ""brace"": B R A C E? but we know B is excluded? so brace invalid? 
   ""trace"": T R A C E -> avoids known excluded letters? 
      T and C? we don't know? 

   ""frace""? not a word? 
   ""grape""? but ends with E? and G at1, P at4? but known excluded letters: avoided? 
   ""grade""? D is excluded? 
   ""grate"": G R A T E? 

 But note: we haven't ruled out G? 

 Also, ""crane""? but crane uses C? and also we had excluded? No? Crane uses C and N? 

 But wait: we haven't ruled out C? 

 But note: we have eliminated: I, S, D, O, B, V? So C, G, T, N, L, M, P, ... are still possible.

 Let's think of possible words:
   grace, trace, brace (invalid due to B), crate, grate, drace? not word?

 Considering the constraints? 
   The word must be English? 

   Possibilities: 
     crate: C R A T E? -> C and T? 
     trace: T R A C E? 
     grace: G R A C E? 
     trade: but D excluded? 
     grape: G R A P E? ends with E? 

   But note: position4? Any letter? 

   Must avoid eliminated letters? 

   Also, we don't have any constraints for position1? 

   Now, we have only 3 guesses left? We want to maximize information? 

   But note: in the next guess, we might fix it? 

   We have the form: [letter1] R A [letter4] E? 

   We have two letters unknown? 

   There are multiple possibilities: 
      letter1: could be many? letter4: could be many? 

   But if we guess ""trace"", then we are testing T and C? 

   How about ""graze""? but V? We haven't excluded Z? 

   Wait: we haven't excluded Z? So ""graze"" is possible? 

   But note: in previous guesses, we didn't test Z? 

   So many words? 

   Alternatively, note that we haven't tested many common letters? So we might guess a word that uses letters we haven't tested? 

   Since we have R and A fixed? And E? Then we don't need to worry? 

   But we must get the word? 

   We can try ""grape""? 
      grape: G R A P E -> 
         G: new? 
         R: correct? 
         A: correct? 
         P: new? 
         E: correct. 

   Then feedback: 
      If G is in the word? But at position1? then ✓? or not? 
      Similarly, P at position4? 

   So if we guess and get both correct? we win? 

   Or we can try ""trace"", etc.

   But note: we are not forced to stick to the pattern? 

   Actually, we are at guess 4? and we have 6 tries? 

   The safest? We can try a word that uses the pattern? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that eliminates many possibilities? 

   However, we have only two positions to fill? and we know the pattern? So we can make a guess that tests the most common letters for those positions? 

   For letter1: common letters? G, T, C, F, etc? 
   For letter4: common letters? T, C, P, N, etc? 

   Why not guess ""crate""? 

   But note: we don't know any of the new letters? 

   We must make a guess that includes only letters we haven't eliminated? 

   Possible letters? 
      From the alphabet: eliminate B,D,I,O,S,V. 
      Available: A,C,E,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,P,Q,R,T,U,W,X,Y,Z? 
        But note: A,R,E are already known? 

   So for letter1: any available letter? 
   For letter4: any available? 

   Since there are many? we want a word that uses common letters for those positions? 

   Let me think: common words: 
      crate, trace, grace, grade (but D excluded), grape, trance (5 letter? no, 6 letters), 
      place? P L A C E? but pattern: ? R A ? E? 
      So the word must start with ? and then R at position2? not L? 

   The word must be X R A Y E? 

   So: 
      crate: C R A T E? 
      grace: G R A C E? 
      trace: T R A C E? 
      gauge? not R? 

   Also, ""grate"": G R A T E? 
   ""prate"": P R A T E? 
   ""irate"": I excluded? 

   ""frate""? not word? 
   ""wrate""? not? 

   Valid words: 
      crate, grate, prate, trace, grace, frate? (not common)? 

   But frate? I think not valid? 

   Accepted words? 
      crate, trace, grace, prate, trice? but trice has I? excluded? 

   Also, ""brace"": B excluded? 

   So available: 
      crate (C,T), trace (T,C), grace (G,C), prate (P,T), grate (G,T), drake? D excluded? 

   So: crate, trace, grace, prate, grate? 

   Now, we want to cover as many letters as possible? 

   grace: uses G and C? 
   crate: C and T? 
   trace: T and C? same as crate? 
   prate: P and T? 
   grate: G and T? 

   Since C and T are common? why not crate? 

   Or, since we haven't tested C and T? but we need to know? 

   Let's guess ""crate""? and if it's not? then we get feedback? which might tell us if C and T are in? 

   But if the word is crate, then we win? 

   Similarly, if not, we learn about C and T? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses one letter at position1 and then a letter we already know? but we know only E,R,A? and they are fixed? 

   Therefore, I choose ""crate"" as a common candidate? 

   So guess: crate

   If it's not ""crate"", then we get:
      C: ? 
      R: ✓? 
      A: ✓? 
      T: ? 
      E: ✓? 

   And we know then the word must be grace, prate, grate, or trace etc? 

   After feedback, we can guess? 

   We have two more guesses after this? 

   But note: if the word is trace? then T at position1? and C at position4? 

   But crate uses C at1 and T at4? 

   So we'll see? 

   Alternatively, we can guess ""trace""? 

   Same as crate? 

   But let me note: trace: T R A C E? 
        crate: C R A T E? 

   Then, if the secret word is trace? 
        crate: 
          position1: C -> not T? but C is in the word? at position4? then C at1 is minused? 
          position4: T -> not C? but T is in the word? at position1? so T at4 minused? 
        so feedback: C(-) R(✓) A(✓) T(-) E(✓)

        then we would know: 
          C is present but minused? so at wrong position? 
          T is present but minused? wrong position? 

        and then we know the word is trace? 

        Similarly, if secret is crate? 
          we'd get C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) -> win? 

        Or if secret is grace? 
          crate: 
             C at1: secret has G? so not C at1? but secret has C at position4? so then:
                 position1: C -> not in secret at all? because grace has no C? wait grace: G R A C E? So C at position4? 
                 then:
                    crate: 
                         C at1: secret has C? but at position4? so minus? 
                         T at4: secret has C at4? so T? not? then T might be not in the word? so x? 

          so crate: C(minus?) so C is present? Then T? might be absent? 

          Specifically:
             C at1: present? but not at1? then minus? 
             T at4: absent? then x? 

          so feedback: C(-) R(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓) 

          Then we would know: 
             The letter at position4 must be C? because we know from grace? 
             Therefore, the word is grace? 

        So we can deduce? 

   Therefore, crate is a good guess? 

   Let's go with crate? 

   So <guess>crate</guess>
</think>
### Thought Process:
With the feedback from Guess 3: ""brave"" → B(x) R(✓) A(✓) V(x) E(✓), we now know:
- **Secret word structure**: `_ R A _ E`  
  - Position 2: R (fixed)  
  - Position 3: A (fixed)  
  - Position 5: E (fixed)  
- **Eliminated letters**: B, V, I, S, D, O (from all previous feedback).  
- **Remaining positions**: Position 1 and position 4 need to be filled with non-eliminated letters.  

**Objective for Guess 4**:  
- Test common letters for position 1 (e.g., C, G, T, P) and position 4 (e.g., C, T, P, N) to solve the word.  
- ""crate"" is chosen because:  
  - It fits the pattern (`C R A T E`).  
  - C (position 1) and T (position 4) are high-frequency letters not yet tested.  
  - If correct, we win. If incorrect, feedback on C/T will resolve remaining possibilities (e.g., ""grace"", ""grate"", ""trace"", or ""prate"").  

<guess>crate</guess>",crate,"We have feedback from Guess 3: brave -> B(x) R(✓) A(✓) V(x) E(✓)
 This means:
   B is not in the word (x)
   R is in the correct position (position 2? because in brave, R is at position 2) so R is the second letter of the secret word.
   A is in the correct position (position 3? because in brave, A is at position 3) so A is the third letter of the secret word.
   V is not in the word (x)
   E is at the end (position 5) which we already knew.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R A _ E

 And we know the word does not contain B, V, I, S, D, O (from previous feedback).

 Also, note that we have E at the end? Yes.

 Now, we know two more positions: R at position 2, and A at position 3? So the word is ? R A ? E

 We need to fill in the first and fourth positions? 

 But also note: from Guess 1: ""raise"" gave us that R was present but not at position 1? Well, now we know it is at position 2? So that matches.

 And from Guess 1: A was present but not at position 2? Now we have it at position 3? So consistent.

 Now, what letters can we use? 
   We must avoid: I, S, D, O, B, V? 

 And not all letters are ruled out? 

 We need to find a 5-letter English word of the form _ R A _ E? and avoiding the above letters? and also must be valid.

 Common words: 
   ""grace""? G (position1) and C (position4) -> ends with E? 
   ""trace"": T R A C E? 
   ""brace"": B R A C E? but we know B is excluded? so brace invalid? 
   ""trace"": T R A C E -> avoids known excluded letters? 
      T and C? we don't know? 

   ""frace""? not a word? 
   ""grape""? but ends with E? and G at1, P at4? but known excluded letters: avoided? 
   ""grade""? D is excluded? 
   ""grate"": G R A T E? 

 But note: we haven't ruled out G? 

 Also, ""crane""? but crane uses C? and also we had excluded? No? Crane uses C and N? 

 But wait: we haven't ruled out C? 

 But note: we have eliminated: I, S, D, O, B, V? So C, G, T, N, L, M, P, ... are still possible.

 Let's think of possible words:
   grace, trace, brace (invalid due to B), crate, grate, drace? not word?

 Considering the constraints? 
   The word must be English? 

   Possibilities: 
     crate: C R A T E? -> C and T? 
     trace: T R A C E? 
     grace: G R A C E? 
     trade: but D excluded? 
     grape: G R A P E? ends with E? 

   But note: position4? Any letter? 

   Must avoid eliminated letters? 

   Also, we don't have any constraints for position1? 

   Now, we have only 3 guesses left? We want to maximize information? 

   But note: in the next guess, we might fix it? 

   We have the form: [letter1] R A [letter4] E? 

   We have two letters unknown? 

   There are multiple possibilities: 
      letter1: could be many? letter4: could be many? 

   But if we guess ""trace"", then we are testing T and C? 

   How about ""graze""? but V? We haven't excluded Z? 

   Wait: we haven't excluded Z? So ""graze"" is possible? 

   But note: in previous guesses, we didn't test Z? 

   So many words? 

   Alternatively, note that we haven't tested many common letters? So we might guess a word that uses letters we haven't tested? 

   Since we have R and A fixed? And E? Then we don't need to worry? 

   But we must get the word? 

   We can try ""grape""? 
      grape: G R A P E -> 
         G: new? 
         R: correct? 
         A: correct? 
         P: new? 
         E: correct. 

   Then feedback: 
      If G is in the word? But at position1? then ✓? or not? 
      Similarly, P at position4? 

   So if we guess and get both correct? we win? 

   Or we can try ""trace"", etc.

   But note: we are not forced to stick to the pattern? 

   Actually, we are at guess 4? and we have 6 tries? 

   The safest? We can try a word that uses the pattern? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that eliminates many possibilities? 

   However, we have only two positions to fill? and we know the pattern? So we can make a guess that tests the most common letters for those positions? 

   For letter1: common letters? G, T, C, F, etc? 
   For letter4: common letters? T, C, P, N, etc? 

   Why not guess ""crate""? 

   But note: we don't know any of the new letters? 

   We must make a guess that includes only letters we haven't eliminated? 

   Possible letters? 
      From the alphabet: eliminate B,D,I,O,S,V. 
      Available: A,C,E,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,P,Q,R,T,U,W,X,Y,Z? 
        But note: A,R,E are already known? 

   So for letter1: any available letter? 
   For letter4: any available? 

   Since there are many? we want a word that uses common letters for those positions? 

   Let me think: common words: 
      crate, trace, grace, grade (but D excluded), grape, trance (5 letter? no, 6 letters), 
      place? P L A C E? but pattern: ? R A ? E? 
      So the word must start with ? and then R at position2? not L? 

   The word must be X R A Y E? 

   So: 
      crate: C R A T E? 
      grace: G R A C E? 
      trace: T R A C E? 
      gauge? not R? 

   Also, ""grate"": G R A T E? 
   ""prate"": P R A T E? 
   ""irate"": I excluded? 

   ""frate""? not word? 
   ""wrate""? not? 

   Valid words: 
      crate, grate, prate, trace, grace, frate? (not common)? 

   But frate? I think not valid? 

   Accepted words? 
      crate, trace, grace, prate, trice? but trice has I? excluded? 

   Also, ""brace"": B excluded? 

   So available: 
      crate (C,T), trace (T,C), grace (G,C), prate (P,T), grate (G,T), drake? D excluded? 

   So: crate, trace, grace, prate, grate? 

   Now, we want to cover as many letters as possible? 

   grace: uses G and C? 
   crate: C and T? 
   trace: T and C? same as crate? 
   prate: P and T? 
   grate: G and T? 

   Since C and T are common? why not crate? 

   Or, since we haven't tested C and T? but we need to know? 

   Let's guess ""crate""? and if it's not? then we get feedback? which might tell us if C and T are in? 

   But if the word is crate, then we win? 

   Similarly, if not, we learn about C and T? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses one letter at position1 and then a letter we already know? but we know only E,R,A? and they are fixed? 

   Therefore, I choose ""crate"" as a common candidate? 

   So guess: crate

   If it's not ""crate"", then we get:
      C: ? 
      R: ✓? 
      A: ✓? 
      T: ? 
      E: ✓? 

   And we know then the word must be grace, prate, grate, or trace etc? 

   After feedback, we can guess? 

   We have two more guesses after this? 

   But note: if the word is trace? then T at position1? and C at position4? 

   But crate uses C at1 and T at4? 

   So we'll see? 

   Alternatively, we can guess ""trace""? 

   Same as crate? 

   But let me note: trace: T R A C E? 
        crate: C R A T E? 

   Then, if the secret word is trace? 
        crate: 
          position1: C -> not T? but C is in the word? at position4? then C at1 is minused? 
          position4: T -> not C? but T is in the word? at position1? so T at4 minused? 
        so feedback: C(-) R(✓) A(✓) T(-) E(✓)

        then we would know: 
          C is present but minused? so at wrong position? 
          T is present but minused? wrong position? 

        and then we know the word is trace? 

        Similarly, if secret is crate? 
          we'd get C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) -> win? 

        Or if secret is grace? 
          crate: 
             C at1: secret has G? so not C at1? but secret has C at position4? so then:
                 position1: C -> not in secret at all? because grace has no C? wait grace: G R A C E? So C at position4? 
                 then:
                    crate: 
                         C at1: secret has C? but at position4? so minus? 
                         T at4: secret has C at4? so T? not? then T might be not in the word? so x? 

          so crate: C(minus?) so C is present? Then T? might be absent? 

          Specifically:
             C at1: present? but not at1? then minus? 
             T at4: absent? then x? 

          so feedback: C(-) R(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓) 

          Then we would know: 
             The letter at position4 must be C? because we know from grace? 
             Therefore, the word is grace? 

        So we can deduce? 

   Therefore, crate is a good guess?

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback so we need to make the first guess.
 Since there's no information, we should start with a word that has common letters and distinct letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in word games are often like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Considering that, I'll choose a word that has common vowels and consonants: ""RAISE""

 Why ""RAISE""?
 - It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
 - All letters are distinct, so we can get maximum information about five different letters.

 Therefore, I'll start with ""RAISE"".

 Let me output the guess accordingly.I'm making my first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I'll choose a common starting word that uses frequent letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Words like ""RAISE"" or ""CRANE"" are popular in word games because they cover multiple vowels and common consonants. 

For this first attempt, I'll select ""RAISE"":  
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)  
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of revealing useful clues about the secret word  

This sets a solid foundation for refining subsequent guesses based on feedback.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
 R -> (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 A -> (-) meaning A is in the word but in the wrong position.
 I -> (x) meaning I is not in the word.
 S -> (x) meaning S is not in the word.
 E -> (✓) meaning E is in the word and in the correct position (which is the fifth letter).

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"" (positions 1 and 2 respectively).
 - The secret word does not contain I or S.
 - The letter E is at the end (position 5) of the word.

 Since E is at the fifth position, the secret word ends with E.

 We must avoid using the letters I and S in future guesses.

 Also, note that R is in the word but not at position 1, and A is in the word but not at position 2.

 With these constraints, we think of a new word.

 Structure of the secret word: _ _ _ _ E

 We know the word has R and A, and the R cannot be at the start and A cannot be the second letter.

 We can consider common words ending in E. The fifth letter is fixed as E.

 Let's think of the positions for R and A. R is not at position 1, A is not at position 2.

 Also, note that the secret word is five letters and must include R, A and E (which we already have), and two other letters.

 Since we do not have any information about the middle letters, we can try a word that has R and A in different positions and avoids I and S.

 Possible positions for R: it could be in position 2,3,4? But note that position 1 is excluded because of the feedback. In our guess, R was at position 1 and feedback says it's not there, but it is present elsewhere.

 Similarly, A was at position 2 and feedback says it's present but not at position 2.

 So, in the new guess, we should put R at a position other than 1 (and also not positions where we've ruled out? Actually only position 1 is ruled out for R). For A, we must not put it at position 2.

 Let's aim to test new letters and try to place R and A in other positions to get more feedback.

 We can think of words ending with E and having R and A.

 Example words: 
 - carve? but we don't know if C, V are present.
 - aware: has A and R, ends with E. But note that A is at position 1 and R at position 3? 
   Also, we have to avoid S and I.

 Let's check ""aware"": 
   A, W, A, R, E -> but note: it has two A's, which might be okay.

 However, what about the constraints?
   The secret word has at least one A (since we got a minus for A). Our feedback for A specifically said it was present but not in position 2. Our first guess had A in position 2 and that was wrong.

 In ""aware"", the first letter is A. We don't know if A is in the word at position 1? It might be. Remember, the feedback for R (position 1 in first guess) was minus, meaning if we put A in position 1 that would be a different position. So it's allowed.

 Similarly, we are putting R in position 4? That wasn't tested before.

 But note: the secret word might have multiple letters? We don't know.

 However, we have only one R and one A indicated? Actually the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. So we cannot be sure.

 Given the constraint, we want to test a word that has:
   - E at the end (position 5) -> already set.
   - Includes R and A.
   - Avoids I and S.

 We also want to include as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Since the secret word has E at the end, we can try ""DANCE"" but DANCE has C which is new? But note we don't know if D, N, C are present. However, we must include R? Actually we must include R because we know it's in the word. So ""dance"" does not have R.

 Therefore, we need a word that has the letters R and A, and ends in E.

 Let's list some common words: 
   aware, argue, arose, arise -> but arise has S? (arise has S? a-r-i-s-e -> yes, but S was ruled out) so avoid arise.

 We know S is not in the word, so avoid words with S.

 Similarly, avoid I.

 So: 
   argue -> has U and G? but also E at end. And it has R and A? 
      argue: A (position 1), R (position 2), G, U, E -> but we have R at position 2? Remember feedback: R was not at position 1, but position 2 was not tested? Actually we tested R at position 1 and that was misplaced. Now if we test R at position 2, that might be correct? But we don't know.

 However, note the feedback about A: in the first guess A was at position 2 and was misplaced. So if the secret word had A at position 2, we would have gotten a check? Then that position for A is specifically wrong. But R at position 1 was wrong, but at position 2 might be okay? 

 Alternatively, let's try ""crane"" but note:
   crane: C,R,A,N,E -> but it has E at the end? Yes. But also we have S? No. However, we used ""raise"" and now we know I and S are not in the word. So we can't use crane because it includes R and A? Actually, it does include R and A. But note: we haven't used the letter C and N and also we avoid S and I.

 However, in ""crane"", R is at position 2 and A at position 3.

 But remember, in the first guess:
   R was at position 1 -> wrong position. So if the secret word has R at position 2? In ""crane"", if we put R at position 2 and if the secret word has R at position 2, we would get a check for R? 
   Similarly, A at position 3: we don't have feedback for that position.

 Also, E is at position 5 which we know is correct.

 So by trying ""crane"" we would test:
   C: new letter
   R: at position 2 -> if correct or wrong?
   A: at position 3 -> if correct or wrong?
   N: new letter
   E: known correct at position 5.

 That might be good because it tests the R at position 2 and A at position 3, and introduces C and N.

 But note: we have to avoid S and I? Crane has no S or I. Good.

 However, what if the secret word doesn't have C and N? Then we get x for them and we gain more information.

 Another possibility: ""drake"" -> D, R, A, K, E -> avoids S and I? Yes. Has R and A? Yes. Ends in E? Yes.

 In ""drake"", R is at position 2 and A at position 3? Same as crane.

 So let's choose a word that has R and A in positions we haven't tested? But we already know R can't be position 1 and A can't be position 2.

 How about we try a word with R at position 3 and A at position 4? 

 For example: ""opera"" -> o-p-e-r-a? That doesn't end with E? So not opera.

 Or ""lance"" -> has no R. Must include R.

 Or ""large"" -> letter L, A, R, G, E -> avoid S and I? Yes. 
   Large: L (1), A (2), R (3), G (4), E (5). 

 But note: in this word, 
   position 1: L -> new letter
   position 2: A -> but our feedback for A said it's not at position 2 (from the first guess). So if we put A at position 2, and if the secret word has A at position 2, we would get a check? But in our feedback, we put A at position 2 and got a minus? That means position 2 is wrong for A. So we cannot put A at position 2 again because we know it's not there.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 2? And similarly, we must avoid putting R at position 1? Yes.

 So we cannot guess ""aware"" because that puts A at position 1? Actually ""aware"" is a-w-a-r-e? Let me spell: ""aware"" is A (1), W (2), A (3), R (4), E (5). Note: two A's? 

 But the secret word may have two A's? We don't know. But in the first guess, we only had one A and got minus? Meaning that A is in the word but not in position 2. So one A is somewhere? It doesn't preclude two A's.

 However, if we put A at position 1 in ""aware"", that might be okay (if the secret word has A at position 1) or also at position 3? 

 But note: we need to test R in a new position? Previously we only tested it at position 1 and it was wrong. So we can test it at position 4? 

 Therefore, ""aware"" is a valid guess? Because:
   position 1: A -> untested for A? We only know A is not at position 2.
   position 2: W -> new letter.
   position 3: A -> but wait, we don't know if there are two A's? We simply test.
   position 4: R -> would test R at position 4? 
   position 5: E -> known.

 However, we have two A's? We don't know if the secret word has two A's? If it doesn't, then one of the A positions must match.

 But note: the secret word must have A exactly? Yes, at least one. So if we put two A's, it might mislead? Actually the feedback would mark only the A's appropriately.

 Alternatively, let's try a word with one A? But we want to maximize letter coverage.

 Another idea: we can use ""grave""? grave: G, R, A, V, E -> ends with E? yes. 
   positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:V, 5:E.

 Now, note that we are putting R at position 2? We don't know if it can be at position 2? 
   Previously R was at position 1 and misplaced -> so position 1 is wrong, but position 2 might be okay? 
 Similarly, we are putting A at position 3? We know it's not at position 2? Position 3 is new.

 Also, G and V are new.

 This seems good: we are testing R at position 2 and A at position 3? 

 But what if the secret word has A at position 3? Then we would get a check? Or if not? 

 Also, we avoid I and S? Yes.

 So let's consider ""grave"".

 However, note the feedback: we have E at the end? Yes.

 But what if the secret word doesn't have G or V? Then we get x for them.

 Alternatively, we might also consider ""price"" -> but we have I? We know I is not in the word? So avoid price? Yes, because it has I.

 Then ""grave"" seems acceptable.

 Let's think about ""crane"": 
   Crane: position1:C, position2:R, position3:A, position4:N, position5:E.
   Then:
      C: new -> we'll get feedback if present and position?
      R: position2 -> if the secret word has R at position2? 
      A: position3 -> if secret word has A at position3?
      N: new
      E: known.

 It's similar to grave? But has N instead of V.

 Since we want to maximize new letters? Both crane and grave introduce two new letters? And test R at 2 and A at 3? 

 But note: in the secret word, we don't know where A is? It could be at position 1? Or position 3? Or position 4?

 We might test R at position 4? We haven't tested that? 

 But in both crane and grave, we test R at 2. We want to get more positioning information? 

 Another word: ""parse"" -> but parse has S? Avoid since S is not in the word.

 Or ""barge"": B, A, R, G, E -> 
   positions: B (1), A (2), R (3), G (4), E (5) -> but note: A is at position2? We know that A cannot be at position 2 because in first guess we had A at position2 and it was minus? So we would be repeating a mistake? 

 Therefore, avoid putting A at position2.

 So in ""barge"", position2 is A -> so that's invalid? We know A is not at position2? So we shouldn't put it there again.

 Similarly, we must avoid putting A at position2? So we shouldn't do that.

 So ""aware"" is okay? Because in aware:
   A is at position1 and position3? and we are not putting it at position2? Position2 is W.

 Specifically:
   Position1: A -> this is a new position for A, which we haven't tested? (first guess tested A at position2) 
   Position2: W -> new
   Position3: A -> we are testing A again? But it's at position3? 
   Position4: R -> testing R at position4? 
   Position5: E

 So this tests:
   A at two positions: 1 and 3 (if the secret word has A at one of those, we'd get at least one minus? if both are wrong then both minuses? or if one matches, then a check? 
   Or in case of one occurrence? if the secret word has A only at position1, then the first A would be ✓ and the second A might be x if there's no duplicate? Actually, we are using double A? So the feedback might mark two A's? 

 But note: the feedback rule: 
   ✓ for correct position and letter.
   - for letter in word but not that position.
   x for not in word.

 But if the word has one A? Then in a guess with two A's? The rules in Wordle: 
   The feedback will assign one minus or check for each occurrence? Actually, the exact rule: 
      Each letter in the secret word is matched to the guess's letter at the same position? Then the remaining are matched? 

 But in detail: 
   The secret BRISK and guess STORM: 
        S (from guess) -> S is present? But in BRISK there's no S? So it's x? Actually the example shows S(-) -> wait no, let me see: 
        The example feedback for STORM on secret BRISK: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

        Actually, BRISK has S? no? So why is S(-)? 
        Wait, the example says ""Secret Word: BRISK"", which has S? B-R-I-S-K -> S is at position4? 

        So STORM -> 
          position1: S vs B -> S is in the word? (at position4) -> but not here? so minus
          position2: T vs R -> T not in word? x
          position3: O vs I -> not in word? x
          position4: R vs S -> R is in the word? but actually R is at position2? So for position4: we have R? but secret has S? -> S is at position4? Then R at position4: not S? so actually R is in the word but not at position4? But wait, R is already matched at position2? 

        How the feedback is generated?
          First, mark exact matches? None.
          Then, for non-matched letters in the guess, if there are non-matched same letters in the secret? So S in guess is at position1 -> secret has S at position4? non-matched? so minus? 
          Then R in guess at position4: secret has R? But secret R is at position2? which is unmatched? Then R would get a minus? 

        Similarly, T, O, M are not in secret? So x.

        So for two same letters? If there are two same A's? Then if both are correct? then both ✓? Or if one is correct? one ✓ and the other might be - if the other exists? 

 But we cannot assume duplicates? The secret word might have one R? or two? 

 Therefore, we must be cautious.

 For simplicity, we can avoid words with duplicate letters? So we can have distinct letters? 

 Then ""crane"" has no duplicates? And tests:
   position1: C -> new
   position2: R -> not tested at 2? (only at 1 tested - misplaced)
   position3: A -> not tested at 3? (only at 2 tested - misplaced)
   position4: N -> new
   position5: E -> known.

 Also, avoids I and S? Yes.

 Similarly, ""grave"" has distinct letters? Yes: G,R,A,V,E? 

 So both ""crane"" and ""grave"" are acceptable? 

 But note: we already tried ""raise"" and it used R,A,E? so ""crane"" uses R,A,E? which might be overlapping in letters? But the secret word might have more letters? So we don't know.

 Why not choose ""grave""? Or ""crane""?

 Alternatively, we can consider the frequency of letters? Let me think: 

   We have already tested: R, A, I, S, E -> so I and S are not there.

   Now, we want to test new common letters? 

   The most common letters usually: E, A, R, O, T, ... but note O hasn't been tested? 

   Crane has C, R, A, N, E -> R and A are known to be present? So we are testing C and N? 

   Grave has G, R, A, V, E -> testing G and V? 

   How common? 
      In English, N is more common than V? Also, C and G are similarly common? 

   Also, O and T might be good? 

   Therefore, another word like ""other"" -> ends with E? Wait, ""other"" doesn't end with E? 

   We need ending in E? 

   How about ""alone""? But wait, we must include R and A? Also, A at position2? We shouldn't put A at position2? Because we know it's not there.

   ""adore"" -> A at position1? Then D, O, R, E -> avoids position2 for A? And ends in E? 
       adore: A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), E(5) -> 
          A: now testing A at position1? 
          D: new
          O: new, common
          R: testing R at position4? 
          E: known.

      And avoids I and S? Yes.

      So ""adore"" is a good candidate? 

   Compare ""crane"" and ""adore""? 
        crane: tests R at position2 and A at position3? 
        adore: tests A at position1 and R at position4? 

      Which is better? 

      We know that R is not at position1? But it could be at position2? Or position4? 
      Similarly, A is not at position2? Could be at position1? Or position3? Or position4? 

      So testing different positions? 

      Also, adore uses D and O? which are popular? 

   Another candidate: ""opera"" doesn't end with E? 

   ""ample"" -> doesn't have R? 

   We definitely need to include R? We have to.

   Given these?

   Let me choose ""adore"" because it tests A at a new position (1) and R at a new position (4) and introduces D and O? common letters.

   So the new guess: ""adore""

   Alternatively, ""crane"" would test R at position2? We want to check if R is at position2? 

   Since we have limited guesses (6 total), we can only test one? 

   But whichever we choose? 

   I think both are reasonable? 

   Let me go with ""crane""? because it puts R and A both in the middle? 

   But note: the secret word might have R at position4? 

   Alternatively, ""ropey"" -> not a real word? Wait, let me stick to real words.

   After thinking, I choose ""adore"" because:

      We know E is at the end -> fixed.

      We are testing A at position1? If that's correct? then we get a check? which would be good? 
      We are testing R at position4? if that's correct? 

      Also, we are testing D and O? 

   Therefore, I'll guess ""adore"".

   So the word: adore

<guess>adore</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":  
- ✓ E is fixed at position 5.  
- ◊ R and A are in the secret word but incorrectly positioned (R cannot be at position 1, A cannot be at position 2).  
- ✗ I and S are eliminated.  

For the second guess:  
- Must include R and A while avoiding positions 1 for R and 2 for A.  
- Ends with E at position 5.  
- Tests new common letters (like O and D) for coverage.  
- ""adore"" fits:  
  - Tests A at position 1 (new position)  
  - Tests R at position 4 (untested position)  
  - Introduces new letters D (position 2) and O (position 3)  
  - Maintains E at position 5

<guess>adore</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: adore -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given cumulative feedback:

Guess 1: ""raise"" -> R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- R is in the word, but not in position 1.
- A is in the word, but not in position 2.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word and at position 5 (correct).

Guess 2: ""adore"" -> A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)
Meaning:
- A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- D is not in the word.
- O is not in the word.
- R is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E is confirmed at position 5.

Synthesis:
- E is fixed at position 5: the word has to be _ _ _ _ E
- Letters R and A are present, but they are not in the positions they were guessed: 
  - R: not at position 1 (from guess1) and not at position 4 (from guess2)
- A: not at position 2 (from guess1) and not at position 1 (from guess2)
- Letters I, S, D, O are absent.

Therefore, we know the word ends with E, contains R and A, and excludes I, S, D, O.

Now, we need to consider remaining positions for R and A:
- R must be in position 2, 3 or 5? But position 5 is E -> so positions 2 or 3.
- Similarly, A must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But E is at 5 -> so A at 3 or 4? But positions: 1,2,3,4 are free? Actually, position 5 is fixed as E.

We must re-check positions:
- Secret word: position 1: ?; position 2: ?; position 3: ?; position 4: ?; position 5: E

Constraints:
- A: cannot be position 1 (tested in adore) and not position 2 (tested in raise) -> so A must be in position 3 or 4.
- R: cannot be position 1 (tested in raise) and not position 4 (tested in adore) -> so R must be in position 2 or 3.

Possible conflicts? Position 3: might be both R or A? But it can only be one? So we must account.

Also, the word must be a 5-letter English word ending in E, with R and A, without I,S,D,O.

We need to consider other letters? We have tested: R, A, I, S, E, D, O, and Adore also used the letters A, D, O, R, E.

Thus, absent letters: I, S, D, O.

Now, what other letters could appear? We don't know? We have to guess letters not excluded.

Therefore, pick a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Includes R and A in the positions: 
  R: only allowed in 2 or 3? 
  A: only in 3 or 4.

But note: the positions for R and A might be the same if position 3? But if both are required? And if position 3? Then the other must be elsewhere? 

Actually, the positions for R and A must be different? Because they are two distinct letters? So:
- Option 1: R at position 2, then A at position 3 or 4? 
- Option 2: R at position 3, then A at position 4? (because position 2 is taken? if R at 3 then A must be at 4, because A cannot be at 1 or 2? and position 1 is the only other? but position 1 is free? but A cannot be at 1? and we already tested that).

Wait: 
- A cannot be at 1? Cannot be at 2? That leaves positions 3 and 4? 
- R cannot be at 1? Cannot be at 4? Which leaves positions 2 and 3.

Now common words ending in E? 

Case 1: R at position 2, A at position 3: then the word would be _ R A _ E? 
Example words: 
- crate: but T and C are allowed? But crate has C, R, A, T, E -> ends with E? 
  Position 2: R? fixed? 
  Position 3: A? fixed?
  Then positions 1: C and 4: T? 

But is C and T present? We don't know? 

If we guess ""crate"", then:
  C: new letter?
  R: at position 2? which we haven't tested? 
  A: at position 3? which we haven't tested?
  T: new letter?
  E: known.

And check the constraints? We avoid I,S,D,O? crate has C, R, A, T, E -> none of I,S,D,O? so acceptable.

But note: what about the possibility of R at position 3 and A at position 4? Then the word is _ _ R A E? 
Example: ""trace"": but trace has T, R, A, C, E -> positions: T(1), R(2) -> wait R at position2? which is the same as above? Actually, wait: if R is at position 3? and A at position4? Then the word? 
Example: ""brace""? B (1), R (2), A (3), C (4), E (5) -> but that's R at 2 and A at 3? 

We need an example with R at 3 and A at 4? 
Like ""flare"": but flare has F, L, A, R, E -> positions: 
  flare: F(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> but R is at 4? we already know R isn't at position4? 

Other word: ""agree""? but agree has A at position1? which we know A isn't at position1? (from adore) -> rejected? 
Another: ""brave"": which was already tried? no? 
But ""brave"": B, R, A, V, E -> positions: R at 2? that's the same as above? 

Wait, I think it's hard? 

Actually, there is ""frame"": F, R, A, M, E -> positions: R at 2? again? 

What about ""grace"": G, R, A, C, E -> positions: R at 2? 

Possibly: ""graze""? It has S? no, Z -> ""graze"" has Z? But we don't know about Z? But note: we haven't ruled out Z? 

But we need R at 3? Let's think: 
  position1: ? 
  position2: some letter?
  position3: R?
  position4: A?
  position5: E

Words: ? 
  Like ""tare""? 4 letters? 

Five letter words: ""care""? 4 letters? 

Examples: 
  ""store""? but S is excluded? 
  ""shire""? S excluded? 

Actually, I cannot find a word with R at position3 and A at position4? But they exist? Such as ""opera"": but opera has O? excluded? 

Another: ""extra"": ends with A? not E? 

""aurae""? which might be not common? 

So perhaps the possibility is low? 

Since we are limited to a small set? 

But we have another option: R at position 3? A at position 4? 

But note: R cannot be at position 4? We tested in adore? So if R is at position 3? That's allowed? Then A at position 4? then word: _ _ R A E? 

Then what about position1 and position2? 

Example: ""brace""? that's 5 letter? B, R, A, C, E -> but R at position2? not at position3? 

To have R at position3: 
  position3: R? 
  position4: A? 

Then valid example: ""flare""? but as we noted ""flare"": positions: 
  F(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> Wait, A at 3? and R at4? But we want R at position3? 

We need R at position3 and A at position4? 

Example: ""opera"" -> O(1), P(2), E(3), R(4), A(5) -> doesn't end with E? 

Another: ""myrrh"" doesn't end with E? 

Actually, let's try: five letters: _ _ R A E -> but with E? The fifth letter is E? So the word pattern: X Y R A E? 

But ""? ? R A E"": any English words? 

Example: ""URAEM"" not valid? 

""grape""? G(1), R(2), A(3), P(4), E(5) -> again R at2? 

""trace"": T, R, A, C, E -> R at2? 

It appears that words with R at position3 and A at position4 and ending in E are rare? 

What about ""grave"": G, R, A, V, E -> R at2? 

So I think the pattern of _ _ R A E might not exist? Therefore, the more likely scenario is R at position2 and A at position3? 

Therefore, I'll guess a word with R at position2 and A at position3, ending in E? And avoid I, S, D, O? 

Therefore, ""crate"" is a candidate? C, R, A, T, E? 

We haven't tested position1. Position4: we haven't tested? 

Another candidate: ""great""? G, R, E, A, T -> doesn't end with E? 

""grade"": G, R, A, D, E -> but D is excluded? 

""graze"": G, R, A, Z, E -> avoids D,O,I,S? Z not tested? 
But ""graze"" is a word? 

But since D and O are excluded, we can include Z? 

Similarly, ""trace"": T, R, A, C, E -> C and T? 

But note: we don't know about T, C, and so on? 

So why not ""crate""? 

But also, ""brave"": B, R, A, V, E -> avoids I,S,D,O? 

So both ""brave"" and ""crate"" are candidates? 

Also, ""frate""? not a word? 

I think I'll choose ""brave"" because we haven't tested B or V? 

But ""crate"" has C and T? which are common? 

Alternatively, note that we have already tested: 
  raise: 5 letters
  adore: 5 letters

So the secret word must contain R and A and E? 

Also, it might contain two other letters? 

We need to test new letters? 

Therefore, let's choose ""brave"": 
  B: new
  R: at position 2 (untested? yes)
  A: at position 3 (untested? yes)
  V: new
  E: fixed at 5? 

But position4 in brave is V? 

If we guess and it's wrong? Then we get feedback on B, V? 

But we can also test for both possibilities? 

After thinking, let's go with ""brave""? 

Alternatively, a word that doesn't fix R and A? But we must fix? because the letter requirements? 

Actually, we must include R and A? And E? 

Also, avoid I,S,D,O? 

Thus, brave: B (new), R, A, V (new), E -> valid? 

Yes.

Therefore, new guess: brave

But let me confirm: 
  Position1: B? 
  Position2: R -> which we haven't tested? 
  Position3: A -> which we haven't tested? 
  Position4: V -> 
  Position5: E? 

If the secret word has A at position3 (if we are lucky) then we'd get A(✓)? 

Similarly, R if at position2? would be R(✓)? 

But note: we don't know if R is at position2? It could be at position3? then A must be at position4? and our guess brave? 
  Position3: A? -> if the secret has R at position2? then A might not at position3? then we get A(-)? 

But we are testing the hypothesis? 

Alternatively, a word that doesn't commit? But then we must include R and A? 

Another word: ""agree""? But A at position1? excluded? and also G? 

""price""? has I? excluded? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""brave"". 

So <guess>brave</guess>Based on previous feedback:  
- **E is fixed at position 5** in all guesses.  
- **R and A** must be in the word but **incorrectly positioned**:  
  - R: Cannot be pos1 (from ""raise"") or pos4 (from ""adore"") → must be pos2 or pos3.  
  - A: Cannot be pos2 (from ""raise"") or pos1 (from ""adore"") → must be pos3 or pos4.  
- **Eliminated letters**: I, S, D, O.  
- Remaining possibilities require testing R at pos2 ⚬, A at pos3 ⚬, and avoiding eliminated letters.  

Optimal guess: ""brave""  
- Tests R at pos2 and A at pos3 (untested positions).  
- Introduces new common consonants (B, V) for coverage.  
- Ends with E (✓).  
- Avoids I/S/D/O.

   A is in the correct position (position 3? because in brave, A is at position 3) so A is the third letter of the secret word.
   V is not in the word (x)
   E is at the end (position 5) which we already knew.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R A _ E

 And we know the word does not contain B, V, I, S, D, O (from previous feedback).

 Also, note that we have E at the end? Yes.

 Now, we know two more positions: R at position 2, and A at position 3? So the word is ? R A ? E

 We need to fill in the first and fourth positions? 

 But also note: from Guess 1: ""raise"" gave us that R was present but not at position 1? Well, now we know it is at position 2? So that matches.

 And from Guess 1: A was present but not at position 2? Now we have it at position 3? So consistent.

 Now, what letters can we use? 
   We must avoid: I, S, D, O, B, V? 

 And not all letters are ruled out? 

 We need to find a 5-letter English word of the form _ R A _ E? and avoiding the above letters? and also must be valid.

 Common words: 
   ""grace""? G (position1) and C (position4) -> ends with E? 
   ""trace"": T R A C E? 
   ""brace"": B R A C E? but we know B is excluded? so brace invalid? 
   ""trace"": T R A C E -> avoids known excluded letters? 
      T and C? we don't know? 

   ""frace""? not a word? 
   ""grape""? but ends with E? and G at1, P at4? but known excluded letters: avoided? 
   ""grade""? D is excluded? 
   ""grate"": G R A T E? 

 But note: we haven't ruled out G? 

 Also, ""crane""? but crane uses C? and also we had excluded? No? Crane uses C and N? 

 But wait: we haven't ruled out C? 

 But note: we have eliminated: I, S, D, O, B, V? So C, G, T, N, L, M, P, ... are still possible.

 Let's think of possible words:
   grace, trace, brace (invalid due to B), crate, grate, drace? not word?

 Considering the constraints? 
   The word must be English? 

   Possibilities: 
     crate: C R A T E? -> C and T? 
     trace: T R A C E? 
     grace: G R A C E? 
     trade: but D excluded? 
     grape: G R A P E? ends with E? 

   But note: position4? Any letter? 

   Must avoid eliminated letters? 

   Also, we don't have any constraints for position1? 

   Now, we have only 3 guesses left? We want to maximize information? 

   But note: in the next guess, we might fix it? 

   We have the form: [letter1] R A [letter4] E? 

   We have two letters unknown? 

   There are multiple possibilities: 
      letter1: could be many? letter4: could be many? 

   But if we guess ""trace"", then we are testing T and C? 

   How about ""graze""? but V? We haven't excluded Z? 

   Wait: we haven't excluded Z? So ""graze"" is possible? 

   But note: in previous guesses, we didn't test Z? 

   So many words? 

   Alternatively, note that we haven't tested many common letters? So we might guess a word that uses letters we haven't tested? 

   Since we have R and A fixed? And E? Then we don't need to worry? 

   But we must get the word? 

   We can try ""grape""? 
      grape: G R A P E -> 
         G: new? 
         R: correct? 
         A: correct? 
         P: new? 
         E: correct. 

   Then feedback: 
      If G is in the word? But at position1? then ✓? or not? 
      Similarly, P at position4? 

   So if we guess and get both correct? we win? 

   Or we can try ""trace"", etc.

   But note: we are not forced to stick to the pattern? 

   Actually, we are at guess 4? and we have 6 tries? 

   The safest? We can try a word that uses the pattern? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that eliminates many possibilities? 

   However, we have only two positions to fill? and we know the pattern? So we can make a guess that tests the most common letters for those positions? 

   For letter1: common letters? G, T, C, F, etc? 
   For letter4: common letters? T, C, P, N, etc? 

   Why not guess ""crate""? 

   But note: we don't know any of the new letters? 

   We must make a guess that includes only letters we haven't eliminated? 

   Possible letters? 
      From the alphabet: eliminate B,D,I,O,S,V. 
      Available: A,C,E,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,P,Q,R,T,U,W,X,Y,Z? 
        But note: A,R,E are already known? 

   So for letter1: any available letter? 
   For letter4: any available? 

   Since there are many? we want a word that uses common letters for those positions? 

   Let me think: common words: 
      crate, trace, grace, grade (but D excluded), grape, trance (5 letter? no, 6 letters), 
      place? P L A C E? but pattern: ? R A ? E? 
      So the word must start with ? and then R at position2? not L? 

   The word must be X R A Y E? 

   So: 
      crate: C R A T E? 
      grace: G R A C E? 
      trace: T R A C E? 
      gauge? not R? 

   Also, ""grate"": G R A T E? 
   ""prate"": P R A T E? 
   ""irate"": I excluded? 

   ""frate""? not word? 
   ""wrate""? not? 

   Valid words: 
      crate, grate, prate, trace, grace, frate? (not common)? 

   But frate? I think not valid? 

   Accepted words? 
      crate, trace, grace, prate, trice? but trice has I? excluded? 

   Also, ""brace"": B excluded? 

   So available: 
      crate (C,T), trace (T,C), grace (G,C), prate (P,T), grate (G,T), drake? D excluded? 

   So: crate, trace, grace, prate, grate? 

   Now, we want to cover as many letters as possible? 

   grace: uses G and C? 
   crate: C and T? 
   trace: T and C? same as crate? 
   prate: P and T? 
   grate: G and T? 

   Since C and T are common? why not crate? 

   Or, since we haven't tested C and T? but we need to know? 

   Let's guess ""crate""? and if it's not? then we get feedback? which might tell us if C and T are in? 

   But if the word is crate, then we win? 

   Similarly, if not, we learn about C and T? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses one letter at position1 and then a letter we already know? but we know only E,R,A? and they are fixed? 

   Therefore, I choose ""crate"" as a common candidate? 

   So guess: crate

   If it's not ""crate"", then we get:
      C: ? 
      R: ✓? 
      A: ✓? 
      T: ? 
      E: ✓? 

   And we know then the word must be grace, prate, grate, or trace etc? 

   After feedback, we can guess? 

   We have two more guesses after this? 

   But note: if the word is trace? then T at position1? and C at position4? 

   But crate uses C at1 and T at4? 

   So we'll see? 

   Alternatively, we can guess ""trace""? 

   Same as crate? 

   But let me note: trace: T R A C E? 
        crate: C R A T E? 

   Then, if the secret word is trace? 
        crate: 
          position1: C -> not T? but C is in the word? at position4? then C at1 is minused? 
          position4: T -> not C? but T is in the word? at position1? so T at4 minused? 
        so feedback: C(-) R(✓) A(✓) T(-) E(✓)

        then we would know: 
          C is present but minused? so at wrong position? 
          T is present but minused? wrong position? 

        and then we know the word is trace? 

        Similarly, if secret is crate? 
          we'd get C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) -> win? 

        Or if secret is grace? 
          crate: 
             C at1: secret has G? so not C at1? but secret has C at position4? so then:
                 position1: C -> not in secret at all? because grace has no C? wait grace: G R A C E? So C at position4? 
                 then:
                    crate: 
                         C at1: secret has C? but at position4? so minus? 
                         T at4: secret has C at4? so T? not? then T might be not in the word? so x? 

          so crate: C(minus?) so C is present? Then T? might be absent? 

          Specifically:
             C at1: present? but not at1? then minus? 
             T at4: absent? then x? 

          so feedback: C(-) R(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓) 

          Then we would know: 
             The letter at position4 must be C? because we know from grace? 
             Therefore, the word is grace? 

        So we can deduce? 

   Therefore, crate is a good guess? 

   Let's go with crate? 

   So <guess>crate</guess>### Thought Process:
With the feedback from Guess 3: ""brave"" → B(x) R(✓) A(✓) V(x) E(✓), we now know:
- **Secret word structure**: `_ R A _ E`  
  - Position 2: R (fixed)  
  - Position 3: A (fixed)  
  - Position 5: E (fixed)  
- **Eliminated letters**: B, V, I, S, D, O (from all previous feedback).  
- **Remaining positions**: Position 1 and position 4 need to be filled with non-eliminated letters.  

**Objective for Guess 4**:  
- Test common letters for position 1 (e.g., C, G, T, P) and position 4 (e.g., C, T, P, N) to solve the word.  
- ""crate"" is chosen because:  
  - It fits the pattern (`C R A T E`).  
  - C (position 1) and T (position 4) are high-frequency letters not yet tested.  
  - If correct, we win. If incorrect, feedback on C/T will resolve remaining possibilities (e.g., ""grace"", ""grate"", ""trace"", or ""prate"").

Since there\'s no prior feedback, I\'ll choose a common starting word that uses frequent letters and vowels to maximize information gain.

The fifth letter is fixed as E.\n\n Let\'s think of the positions for R and A. R is not at position 1, A is not at position 2.\n\n Also, note that the secret word is five letters and must include R, A and E (which we already have), and two other letters.\n\n Since we do not have any information about the middle letters, we can try a word that has R and A in different positions and avoids I and S.\n\n Possible positions for R: it could be in position 2,3,4? But note that position 1 is excluded because of the feedback. In our guess, R was at position 1 and feedback says it\'s not there, but it is present elsewhere.\n\n Similarly, A was at position 2 and feedback says it\'s present but not at position 2.\n\n So, in the new guess, we should put R at a position other than 1 (and also not positions where we\'ve ruled out? Actually only position 1 is ruled out for R). For A, we must not put it at position 2.\n\n Let\'s aim to test new letters and try to place R and A in other positions to get more feedback.\n\n We can think of words ending with E and having R and A.\n\n Example words: \n - carve? but we don\'t know if C, V are present.\n - aware: has A and R, ends with E. But note that A is at position 1 and R at position 3? \n   Also, we have to avoid S and I.\n\n Let\'s check ""aware"": \n   A, W, A, R, E -> but note: it has two A\'s, which might be okay.\n\n However, what about the constraints?\n   The secret word has at least one A (since we got a minus for A). Our feedback for A specifically said it was present but not in position 2. Our first guess had A in position 2 and that was wrong.\n\n In ""aware"", the first letter is A. We don\'t know if A is in the word at position 1? It might be. Remember, the feedback for R (position 1 in first guess) was minus, meaning if we put A in position 1 that would be a different position. So it\'s allowed.\n\n Similarly, we are putting R in position 4? That wasn\'t tested before.\n\n But note: the secret word might have multiple letters? We don\'t know.\n\n However, we have only one R and one A indicated? Actually the feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are duplicates. So we cannot be sure.\n\n Given the constraint, we want to test a word that has:\n   - E at the end (position 5) -> already set.\n   - Includes R and A.\n   - Avoids I and S.\n\n We also want to include as many new letters as possible to get more information.\n\n Since the secret word has E at the end, we can try ""DANCE"" but DANCE has C which is new? But note we don\'t know if D, N, C are present. However, we must include R? Actually we must include R because we know it\'s in the word. So ""dance"" does not have R.\n\n Therefore, we need a word that has the letters R and A, and ends in E.\n\n Let\'s list some common words: \n   aware, argue, arose, arise -> but arise has S? (arise has S? a-r-i-s-e -> yes, but S was ruled out) so avoid arise.\n\n We know S is not in the word, so avoid words with S.\n\n Similarly, avoid I.\n\n So: \n   argue -> has U and G? but also E at end. And it has R and A? \n      argue: A (position 1), R (position 2), G, U, E -> but we have R at position 2? Remember feedback: R was not at position 1, but position 2 was not tested? Actually we tested R at position 1 and that was misplaced. Now if we test R at position 2, that might be correct? But we don\'t know.\n\n However, note the feedback about A: in the first guess A was at position 2 and was misplaced. So if the secret word had A at position 2, we would have gotten a check? Then that position for A is specifically wrong. But R at position 1 was wrong, but at position 2 might be okay? \n\n Alternatively, let\'s try ""crane"" but note:\n   crane: C,R,A,N,E -> but it has E at the end? Yes. But also we have S? No. However, we used ""raise"" and now we know I and S are not in the word. So we can\'t use crane because it includes R and A? Actually, it does include R and A. But note: we haven\'t used the letter C and N and also we avoid S and I.\n\n However, in ""crane"", R is at position 2 and A at position 3.\n\n But remember, in the first guess:\n   R was at position 1 -> wrong position. So if the secret word has R at position 2? In ""crane"", if we put R at position 2 and if the secret word has R at position 2, we would get a check for R? \n   Similarly, A at position 3: we don\'t have feedback for that position.\n\n Also, E is at position 5 which we know is correct.\n\n So by trying ""crane"" we would test:\n   C: new letter\n   R: at position 2 -> if correct or wrong?\n   A: at position 3 -> if correct or wrong?\n   N: new letter\n   E: known correct at position 5.\n\n That might be good because it tests the R at position 2 and A at position 3, and introduces C and N.\n\n But note: we have to avoid S and I? Crane has no S or I. Good.\n\n However, what if the secret word doesn\'t have C and N? Then we get x for them and we gain more information.\n\n Another possibility: ""drake"" -> D, R, A, K, E -> avoids S and I? Yes. Has R and A? Yes. Ends in E? Yes.\n\n In ""drake"", R is at position 2 and A at position 3? Same as crane.\n\n So let\'s choose a word that has R and A in positions we haven\'t tested? But we already know R can\'t be position 1 and A can\'t be position 2.\n\n How about we try a word with R at position 3 and A at position 4? \n\n For example: ""opera"" -> o-p-e-r-a? That doesn\'t end with E? So not opera.\n\n Or ""lance"" -> has no R. Must include R.\n\n Or ""large"" -> letter L, A, R, G, E -> avoid S and I? Yes. \n   Large: L (1), A (2), R (3), G (4), E (5). \n\n But note: in this word, \n   position 1: L -> new letter\n   position 2: A -> but our feedback for A said it\'s not at position 2 (from the first guess). So if we put A at position 2, and if the secret word has A at position 2, we would get a check? But in our feedback, we put A at position 2 and got a minus? That means position 2 is wrong for A. So we cannot put A at position 2 again because we know it\'s not there.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 2? And similarly, we must avoid putting R at position 1? Yes.\n\n So we cannot guess ""aware"" because that puts A at position 1? Actually ""aware"" is a-w-a-r-e? Let me spell: ""aware"" is A (1), W (2), A (3), R (4), E (5). Note: two A\'s? \n\n But the secret word may have two A\'s? We don\'t know. But in the first guess, we only had one A and got minus? Meaning that A is in the word but not in position 2. So one A is somewhere? It doesn\'t preclude two A\'s.\n\n However, if we put A at position 1 in ""aware"", that might be okay (if the secret word has A at position 1) or also at position 3? \n\n But note: we need to test R in a new position? Previously we only tested it at position 1 and it was wrong. So we can test it at position 4? \n\n Therefore, ""aware"" is a valid guess? Because:\n   position 1: A -> untested for A? We only know A is not at position 2.\n   position 2: W -> new letter.\n   position 3: A -> but wait, we don\'t know if there are two A\'s? We simply test.\n   position 4: R -> would test R at position 4? \n   position 5: E -> known.\n\n However, we have two A\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? If it doesn\'t, then one of the A positions must match.\n\n But note: the secret word must have A exactly? Yes, at least one. So if we put two A\'s, it might mislead? Actually the feedback would mark only the A\'s appropriately.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s try a word with one A? But we want to maximize letter coverage.\n\n Another idea: we can use ""grave""? grave: G, R, A, V, E -> ends with E? yes. \n   positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:V, 5:E.\n\n Now, note that we are putting R at position 2? We don\'t know if it can be at position 2? \n   Previously R was at position 1 and misplaced -> so position 1 is wrong, but position 2 might be okay? \n Similarly, we are putting A at position 3? We know it\'s not at position 2? Position 3 is new.\n\n Also, G and V are new.\n\n This seems good: we are testing R at position 2 and A at position 3? \n\n But what if the secret word has A at position 3? Then we would get a check? Or if not? \n\n Also, we avoid I and S? Yes.\n\n So let\'s consider ""grave"".\n\n However, note the feedback: we have E at the end? Yes.\n\n But what if the secret word doesn\'t have G or V? Then we get x for them.\n\n Alternatively, we might also consider ""price"" -> but we have I? We know I is not in the word? So avoid price? Yes, because it has I.\n\n Then ""grave"" seems acceptable.\n\n Let\'s think about ""crane"": \n   Crane: position1:C, position2:R, position3:A, position4:N, position5:E.\n   Then:\n      C: new -> we\'ll get feedback if present and position?\n      R: position2 -> if the secret word has R at position2? \n      A: position3 -> if secret word has A at position3?\n      N: new\n      E: known.\n\n It\'s similar to grave? But has N instead of V.\n\n Since we want to maximize new letters? Both crane and grave introduce two new letters? And test R at 2 and A at 3? \n\n But note: in the secret word, we don\'t know where A is? It could be at position 1? Or position 3? Or position 4?\n\n We might test R at position 4? We haven\'t tested that? \n\n But in both crane and grave, we test R at 2. We want to get more positioning information? \n\n Another word: ""parse"" -> but parse has S? Avoid since S is not in the word.\n\n Or ""barge"": B, A, R, G, E -> \n   positions: B (1), A (2), R (3), G (4), E (5) -> but note: A is at position2? We know that A cannot be at position 2 because in first guess we had A at position2 and it was minus? So we would be repeating a mistake? \n\n Therefore, avoid putting A at position2.\n\n So in ""barge"", position2 is A -> so that\'s invalid? We know A is not at position2? So we shouldn\'t put it there again.\n\n Similarly, we must avoid putting A at position2? So we shouldn\'t do that.\n\n So ""aware"" is okay? Because in aware:\n   A is at position1 and position3? and we are not putting it at position2? Position2 is W.\n\n Specifically:\n   Position1: A -> this is a new position for A, which we haven\'t tested? (first guess tested A at position2) \n   Position2: W -> new\n   Position3: A -> we are testing A again? But it\'s at position3? \n   Position4: R -> testing R at position4? \n   Position5: E\n\n So this tests:\n   A at two positions: 1 and 3 (if the secret word has A at one of those, we\'d get at least one minus? if both are wrong then both minuses? or if one matches, then a check? \n   Or in case of one occurrence? if the secret word has A only at position1, then the first A would be ✓ and the second A might be x if there\'s no duplicate? Actually, we are using double A? So the feedback might mark two A\'s? \n\n But note: the feedback rule: \n   ✓ for correct position and letter.\n   - for letter in word but not that position.\n   x for not in word.\n\n But if the word has one A? Then in a guess with two A\'s? The rules in Wordle: \n   The feedback will assign one minus or check for each occurrence? Actually, the exact rule: \n      Each letter in the secret word is matched to the guess\'s letter at the same position? Then the remaining are matched? \n\n But in detail: \n   The secret BRISK and guess STORM: \n        S (from guess) -> S is present? But in BRISK there\'s no S? So it\'s x? Actually the example shows S(-) -> wait no, let me see: \n        The example feedback for STORM on secret BRISK: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)\n\n        Actually, BRISK has S? no? So why is S(-)? \n        Wait, the example says ""Secret Word: BRISK"", which has S? B-R-I-S-K -> S is at position4? \n\n        So STORM -> \n          position1: S vs B -> S is in the word? (at position4) -> but not here? so minus\n          position2: T vs R -> T not in word? x\n          position3: O vs I -> not in word? x\n          position4: R vs S -> R is in the word? but actually R is at position2? So for position4: we have R? but secret has S? -> S is at position4? Then R at position4: not S? so actually R is in the word but not at position4? But wait, R is already matched at position2? \n\n        How the feedback is generated?\n          First, mark exact matches? None.\n          Then, for non-matched letters in the guess, if there are non-matched same letters in the secret? So S in guess is at position1 -> secret has S at position4? non-matched? so minus? \n          Then R in guess at position4: secret has R? But secret R is at position2? which is unmatched? Then R would get a minus? \n\n        Similarly, T, O, M are not in secret? So x.\n\n        So for two same letters? If there are two same A\'s? Then if both are correct? then both ✓? Or if one is correct? one ✓ and the other might be - if the other exists? \n\n But we cannot assume duplicates? The secret word might have one R? or two? \n\n Therefore, we must be cautious.\n\n For simplicity, we can avoid words with duplicate letters? So we can have distinct letters? \n\n Then ""crane"" has no duplicates? And tests:\n   position1: C -> new\n   position2: R -> not tested at 2? (only at 1 tested - misplaced)\n   position3: A -> not tested at 3? (only at 2 tested - misplaced)\n   position4: N -> new\n   position5: E -> known.\n\n Also, avoids I and S? Yes.\n\n Similarly, ""grave"" has distinct letters? Yes: G,R,A,V,E? \n\n So both ""crane"" and ""grave"" are acceptable? \n\n But note: we already tried ""raise"" and it used R,A,E? so ""crane"" uses R,A,E? which might be overlapping in letters? But the secret word might have more letters? So we don\'t know.\n\n Why not choose ""grave""? Or ""crane""?\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the frequency of letters? Let me think: \n\n   We have already tested: R, A, I, S, E -> so I and S are not there.\n\n   Now, we want to test new common letters? \n\n   The most common letters usually: E, A, R, O, T, ... but note O hasn\'t been tested? \n\n   Crane has C, R, A, N, E -> R and A are known to be present? So we are testing C and N? \n\n   Grave has G, R, A, V, E -> testing G and V? \n\n   How common? \n      In English, N is more common than V? Also, C and G are similarly common? \n\n   Also, O and T might be good? \n\n   Therefore, another word like ""other"" -> ends with E? Wait, ""other"" doesn\'t end with E? \n\n   We need ending in E? \n\n   How about ""alone""? But wait, we must include R and A? Also, A at position2? We shouldn\'t put A at position2? Because we know it\'s not there.\n\n   ""adore"" -> A at position1? Then D, O, R, E -> avoids position2 for A? And ends in E? \n       adore: A(1), D(2), O(3), R(4), E(5) -> \n          A: now testing A at position1? \n          D: new\n          O: new, common\n          R: testing R at position4? \n          E: known.\n\n      And avoids I and S? Yes.\n\n      So ""adore"" is a good candidate? \n\n   Compare ""crane"" and ""adore""? \n        crane: tests R at position2 and A at position3? \n        adore: tests A at position1 and R at position4? \n\n      Which is better? \n\n      We know that R is not at position1? But it could be at position2? Or position4? \n      Similarly, A is not at position2? Could be at position1? Or position3? Or position4? \n\n      So testing different positions? \n\n      Also, adore uses D and O? which are popular? \n\n   Another candidate: ""opera"" doesn\'t end with E? \n\n   ""ample"" -> doesn\'t have R? \n\n   We definitely need to include R? We have to.\n\n   Given these?\n\n   Let me choose ""adore"" because it tests A at a new position (1) and R at a new position (4) and introduces D and O? common letters.\n\n   So the new guess: ""adore""\n\n   Alternatively, ""crane"" would test R at position2? We want to check if R is at position2? \n\n   Since we have limited guesses (6 total), we can only test one? \n\n   But whichever we choose? \n\n   I think both are reasonable? \n\n   Let me go with ""crane""? because it puts R and A both in the middle? \n\n   But note: the secret word might have R at position4? \n\n   Alternatively, ""ropey"" -> not a real word? Wait, let me stick to real words.\n\n   After thinking, I choose ""adore"" because:\n\n      We know E is at the end -> fixed.\n\n      We are testing A at position1? If that\'s correct? then we get a check? which would be good? \n      We are testing R at position4? if that\'s correct? \n\n      Also, we are testing D and O? \n\n   Therefore, I\'ll guess ""adore"".\n\n   So the word: adore\n\n<guess>adore</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":  \n- ✓ E is fixed at position 5.  \n- ◊ R and A are in the secret word but incorrectly positioned (R cannot be at position 1, A cannot be at position 2).  \n- ✗ I and S are eliminated.  \n\nFor the second guess:  \n- Must include R and A while avoiding positions 1 for R and 2 for A.  \n- Ends with E at position 5.  \n- Tests new common letters (like O and D) for coverage.  \n- ""adore"" fits:  \n  - Tests A at position 1 (new position)  \n  - Tests R at position 4 (untested position)  \n  - Introduces new letters D (position 2) and O (position 3)  \n  - Maintains E at position 5\n\n<guess>adore</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: adore -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given cumulative feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""raise"" -> R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the word, but not in position 1.\n- A is in the word, but not in position 2.\n- I is not in the word.\n- S is not in the word.\n- E is in the word and at position 5 (correct).\n\nGuess 2: ""adore"" -> A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- A is in the word, but not in position 1.\n- D is not in the word.\n- O is not in the word.\n- R is in the word, but not in position 4.\n- E is confirmed at position 5.\n\nSynthesis:\n- E is fixed at position 5: the word has to be _ _ _ _ E\n- Letters R and A are present, but they are not in the positions they were guessed: \n  - R: not at position 1 (from guess1) and not at position 4 (from guess2)\n- A: not at position 2 (from guess1) and not at position 1 (from guess2)\n- Letters I, S, D, O are absent.\n\nTherefore, we know the word ends with E, contains R and A, and excludes I, S, D, O.\n\nNow, we need to consider remaining positions for R and A:\n- R must be in position 2, 3 or 5? But position 5 is E -> so positions 2 or 3.\n- Similarly, A must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But E is at 5 -> so A at 3 or 4? But positions: 1,2,3,4 are free? Actually, position 5 is fixed as E.\n\nWe must re-check positions:\n- Secret word: position 1: ?; position 2: ?; position 3: ?; position 4: ?; position 5: E\n\nConstraints:\n- A: cannot be position 1 (tested in adore) and not position 2 (tested in raise) -> so A must be in position 3 or 4.\n- R: cannot be position 1 (tested in raise) and not position 4 (tested in adore) -> so R must be in position 2 or 3.\n\nPossible conflicts? Position 3: might be both R or A? But it can only be one? So we must account.\n\nAlso, the word must be a 5-letter English word ending in E, with R and A, without I,S,D,O.\n\nWe need to consider other letters? We have tested: R, A, I, S, E, D, O, and Adore also used the letters A, D, O, R, E.\n\nThus, absent letters: I, S, D, O.\n\nNow, what other letters could appear? We don\'t know? We have to guess letters not excluded.\n\nTherefore, pick a word that:\n- Ends in E.\n- Includes R and A in the positions: \n  R: only allowed in 2 or 3? \n  A: only in 3 or 4.\n\nBut note: the positions for R and A might be the same if position 3? But if both are required? And if position 3? Then the other must be elsewhere? \n\nActually, the positions for R and A must be different? Because they are two distinct letters? So:\n- Option 1: R at position 2, then A at position 3 or 4? \n- Option 2: R at position 3, then A at position 4? (because position 2 is taken? if R at 3 then A must be at 4, because A cannot be at 1 or 2? and position 1 is the only other? but position 1 is free? but A cannot be at 1? and we already tested that).\n\nWait: \n- A cannot be at 1? Cannot be at 2? That leaves positions 3 and 4? \n- R cannot be at 1? Cannot be at 4? Which leaves positions 2 and 3.\n\nNow common words ending in E? \n\nCase 1: R at position 2, A at position 3: then the word would be _ R A _ E? \nExample words: \n- crate: but T and C are allowed? But crate has C, R, A, T, E -> ends with E? \n  Position 2: R? fixed? \n  Position 3: A? fixed?\n  Then positions 1: C and 4: T? \n\nBut is C and T present? We don\'t know? \n\nIf we guess ""crate"", then:\n  C: new letter?\n  R: at position 2? which we haven\'t tested? \n  A: at position 3? which we haven\'t tested?\n  T: new letter?\n  E: known.\n\nAnd check the constraints? We avoid I,S,D,O? crate has C, R, A, T, E -> none of I,S,D,O? so acceptable.\n\nBut note: what about the possibility of R at position 3 and A at position 4? Then the word is _ _ R A E? \nExample: ""trace"": but trace has T, R, A, C, E -> positions: T(1), R(2) -> wait R at position2? which is the same as above? Actually, wait: if R is at position 3? and A at position4? Then the word? \nExample: ""brace""? B (1), R (2), A (3), C (4), E (5) -> but that\'s R at 2 and A at 3? \n\nWe need an example with R at 3 and A at 4? \nLike ""flare"": but flare has F, L, A, R, E -> positions: \n  flare: F(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> but R is at 4? we already know R isn\'t at position4? \n\nOther word: ""agree""? but agree has A at position1? which we know A isn\'t at position1? (from adore) -> rejected? \nAnother: ""brave"": which was already tried? no? \nBut ""brave"": B, R, A, V, E -> positions: R at 2? that\'s the same as above? \n\nWait, I think it\'s hard? \n\nActually, there is ""frame"": F, R, A, M, E -> positions: R at 2? again? \n\nWhat about ""grace"": G, R, A, C, E -> positions: R at 2? \n\nPossibly: ""graze""? It has S? no, Z -> ""graze"" has Z? But we don\'t know about Z? But note: we haven\'t ruled out Z? \n\nBut we need R at 3? Let\'s think: \n  position1: ? \n  position2: some letter?\n  position3: R?\n  position4: A?\n  position5: E\n\nWords: ? \n  Like ""tare""? 4 letters? \n\nFive letter words: ""care""? 4 letters? \n\nExamples: \n  ""store""? but S is excluded? \n  ""shire""? S excluded? \n\nActually, I cannot find a word with R at position3 and A at position4? But they exist? Such as ""opera"": but opera has O? excluded? \n\nAnother: ""extra"": ends with A? not E? \n\n""aurae""? which might be not common? \n\nSo perhaps the possibility is low? \n\nSince we are limited to a small set? \n\nBut we have another option: R at position 3? A at position 4? \n\nBut note: R cannot be at position 4? We tested in adore? So if R is at position 3? That\'s allowed? Then A at position 4? then word: _ _ R A E? \n\nThen what about position1 and position2? \n\nExample: ""brace""? that\'s 5 letter? B, R, A, C, E -> but R at position2? not at position3? \n\nTo have R at position3: \n  position3: R? \n  position4: A? \n\nThen valid example: ""flare""? but as we noted ""flare"": positions: \n  F(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> Wait, A at 3? and R at4? But we want R at position3? \n\nWe need R at position3 and A at position4? \n\nExample: ""opera"" -> O(1), P(2), E(3), R(4), A(5) -> doesn\'t end with E? \n\nAnother: ""myrrh"" doesn\'t end with E? \n\nActually, let\'s try: five letters: _ _ R A E -> but with E? The fifth letter is E? So the word pattern: X Y R A E? \n\nBut ""? ? R A E"": any English words? \n\nExample: ""URAEM"" not valid? \n\n""grape""? G(1), R(2), A(3), P(4), E(5) -> again R at2? \n\n""trace"": T, R, A, C, E -> R at2? \n\nIt appears that words with R at position3 and A at position4 and ending in E are rare? \n\nWhat about ""grave"": G, R, A, V, E -> R at2? \n\nSo I think the pattern of _ _ R A E might not exist? Therefore, the more likely scenario is R at position2 and A at position3? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess a word with R at position2 and A at position3, ending in E? And avoid I, S, D, O? \n\nTherefore, ""crate"" is a candidate? C, R, A, T, E? \n\nWe haven\'t tested position1. Position4: we haven\'t tested? \n\nAnother candidate: ""great""? G, R, E, A, T -> doesn\'t end with E? \n\n""grade"": G, R, A, D, E -> but D is excluded? \n\n""graze"": G, R, A, Z, E -> avoids D,O,I,S? Z not tested? \nBut ""graze"" is a word? \n\nBut since D and O are excluded, we can include Z? \n\nSimilarly, ""trace"": T, R, A, C, E -> C and T? \n\nBut note: we don\'t know about T, C, and so on? \n\nSo why not ""crate""? \n\nBut also, ""brave"": B, R, A, V, E -> avoids I,S,D,O? \n\nSo both ""brave"" and ""crate"" are candidates? \n\nAlso, ""frate""? not a word? \n\nI think I\'ll choose ""brave"" because we haven\'t tested B or V? \n\nBut ""crate"" has C and T? which are common? \n\nAlternatively, note that we have already tested: \n  raise: 5 letters\n  adore: 5 letters\n\nSo the secret word must contain R and A and E? \n\nAlso, it might contain two other letters? \n\nWe need to test new letters? \n\nTherefore, let\'s choose ""brave"": \n  B: new\n  R: at position 2 (untested? yes)\n  A: at position 3 (untested? yes)\n  V: new\n  E: fixed at 5? \n\nBut position4 in brave is V? \n\nIf we guess and it\'s wrong? Then we get feedback on B, V? \n\nBut we can also test for both possibilities? \n\nAfter thinking, let\'s go with ""brave""? \n\nAlternatively, a word that doesn\'t fix R and A? But we must fix? because the letter requirements? \n\nActually, we must include R and A? And E? \n\nAlso, avoid I,S,D,O? \n\nThus, brave: B (new), R, A, V (new), E -> valid? \n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, new guess: brave\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  Position1: B? \n  Position2: R -> which we haven\'t tested? \n  Position3: A -> which we haven\'t tested? \n  Position4: V -> \n  Position5: E? \n\nIf the secret word has A at position3 (if we are lucky) then we\'d get A(✓)? \n\nSimilarly, R if at position2? would be R(✓)? \n\nBut note: we don\'t know if R is at position2? It could be at position3? then A must be at position4? and our guess brave? \n  Position3: A? -> if the secret has R at position2? then A might not at position3? then we get A(-)? \n\nBut we are testing the hypothesis? \n\nAlternatively, a word that doesn\'t commit? But then we must include R and A? \n\nAnother word: ""agree""? But A at position1? excluded? and also G? \n\n""price""? has I? excluded? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""brave"". \n\nSo <guess>brave</guess>Based on previous feedback:  \n- **E is fixed at position 5** in all guesses.  \n- **R and A** must be in the word but **incorrectly positioned**:  \n  - R: Cannot be pos1 (from ""raise"") or pos4 (from ""adore"") → must be pos2 or pos3.  \n  - A: Cannot be pos2 (from ""raise"") or pos1 (from ""adore"") → must be pos3 or pos4.  \n- **Eliminated letters**: I, S, D, O.  \n- Remaining possibilities require testing R at pos2 ⚬, A at pos3 ⚬, and avoiding eliminated letters.  \n\nOptimal guess: ""brave""  \n- Tests R at pos2 and A at pos3 (untested positions).  \n- Introduces new common consonants (B, V) for coverage.  \n- Ends with E (✓).  \n- Avoids I/S/D/O.\n\n<guess>brave</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: adore -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)\nGuess 3: brave -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) V(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from Guess 3: brave -> B(x) R(✓) A(✓) V(x) E(✓)\n This means:\n   B is not in the word (x)\n   R is in the correct position (position 2? because in brave, R is at position 2) so R is the second letter of the secret word.\n   A is in the correct position (position 3? because in brave, A is at position 3) so A is the third letter of the secret word.\n   V is not in the word (x)\n   E is at the end (position 5) which we already knew.\n\n Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R A _ E\n\n And we know the word does not contain B, V, I, S, D, O (from previous feedback).\n\n Also, note that we have E at the end? Yes.\n\n Now, we know two more positions: R at position 2, and A at position 3? So the word is ? R A ? E\n\n We need to fill in the first and fourth positions? \n\n But also note: from Guess 1: ""raise"" gave us that R was present but not at position 1? Well, now we know it is at position 2? So that matches.\n\n And from Guess 1: A was present but not at position 2? Now we have it at position 3? So consistent.\n\n Now, what letters can we use? \n   We must avoid: I, S, D, O, B, V? \n\n And not all letters are ruled out? \n\n We need to find a 5-letter English word of the form _ R A _ E? and avoiding the above letters? and also must be valid.\n\n Common words: \n   ""grace""? G (position1) and C (position4) -> ends with E? \n   ""trace"": T R A C E? \n   ""brace"": B R A C E? but we know B is excluded? so brace invalid? \n   ""trace"": T R A C E -> avoids known excluded letters? \n      T and C? we don\'t know? \n\n   ""frace""? not a word? \n   ""grape""? but ends with E? and G at1, P at4? but known excluded letters: avoided? \n   ""grade""? D is excluded? \n   ""grate"": G R A T E? \n\n But note: we haven\'t ruled out G? \n\n Also, ""crane""? but crane uses C? and also we had excluded? No? Crane uses C and N? \n\n But wait: we haven\'t ruled out C? \n\n But note: we have eliminated: I, S, D, O, B, V? So C, G, T, N, L, M, P, ... are still possible.\n\n Let\'s think of possible words:\n   grace, trace, brace (invalid due to B), crate, grate, drace? not word?\n\n Considering the constraints? \n   The word must be English? \n\n   Possibilities: \n     crate: C R A T E? -> C and T? \n     trace: T R A C E? \n     grace: G R A C E? \n     trade: but D excluded? \n     grape: G R A P E? ends with E? \n\n   But note: position4? Any letter? \n\n   Must avoid eliminated letters? \n\n   Also, we don\'t have any constraints for position1? \n\n   Now, we have only 3 guesses left? We want to maximize information? \n\n   But note: in the next guess, we might fix it? \n\n   We have the form: [letter1] R A [letter4] E? \n\n   We have two letters unknown? \n\n   There are multiple possibilities: \n      letter1: could be many? letter4: could be many? \n\n   But if we guess ""trace"", then we are testing T and C? \n\n   How about ""graze""? but V? We haven\'t excluded Z? \n\n   Wait: we haven\'t excluded Z? So ""graze"" is possible? \n\n   But note: in previous guesses, we didn\'t test Z? \n\n   So many words? \n\n   Alternatively, note that we haven\'t tested many common letters? So we might guess a word that uses letters we haven\'t tested? \n\n   Since we have R and A fixed? And E? Then we don\'t need to worry? \n\n   But we must get the word? \n\n   We can try ""grape""? \n      grape: G R A P E -> \n         G: new? \n         R: correct? \n         A: correct? \n         P: new? \n         E: correct. \n\n   Then feedback: \n      If G is in the word? But at position1? then ✓? or not? \n      Similarly, P at position4? \n\n   So if we guess and get both correct? we win? \n\n   Or we can try ""trace"", etc.\n\n   But note: we are not forced to stick to the pattern? \n\n   Actually, we are at guess 4? and we have 6 tries? \n\n   The safest? We can try a word that uses the pattern? \n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that eliminates many possibilities? \n\n   However, we have only two positions to fill? and we know the pattern? So we can make a guess that tests the most common letters for those positions? \n\n   For letter1: common letters? G, T, C, F, etc? \n   For letter4: common letters?

We are given feedback from Guess 4: crate -> C(-) R(✓) A(✓) T(-) E(✓)
 This means:
   C is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got a minus for C at position 1).
   R is correct at position 2 (already known).
   A is correct at position 3 (already known).
   T is in the word but not at position 4 (minus for T at position 4).
   E is correct at position 5 (known).

 So, the secret word is of the form: _ R A _ E

 We know:
   - The word contains C and T, but not at positions 1 and 4 respectively.
   - The word does not contain: I, S, D, O, B, V (from previous feedback).

 Since C is in the word but not at position 1, and T is in the word but not at position 4, where can they be?

 The only positions left are position 1 and position 4? But wait, we have:
   Position 1: must be a letter? and we now know it cannot be C? because C is present but not at position 1? 
   But we have two letters to place: C and T? and two positions: 1 and 4? but we just got that C cannot be at 1 and T cannot be at 4? 

 However, note: the word has five letters: 
   Position 1: ? 
   Position 2: R
   Position 3: A
   Position 4: ?
   Position 5: E

 And we know the word contains C and T? and we have two positions to fill? 

 But the feedback says C is present? and T is present? so they must be in the word? 

 Therefore, the only positions available are 1 and 4? 

 But we have constraints:
   C cannot be at position 1? 
   T cannot be at position 4? 

 So, what are the possibilities?
   Option 1: Position 1 is T? and position 4 is C? 
        Then the word would be: T R A C E? which is ""trace""

   Option 2: Could there be duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication? 

   However, note: we have only two positions? and two letters? so if we assign:
        Position 1: T? 
        Position 4: C? 

   Then we get ""trace""

   But what if the word has more than one C or T? 
        For example, if the word has two C's? but we don't have evidence? 

   But note: in the feedback for ""crate"", we had:
        C at position1: minus? meaning C is present but not at 1? 
        T at position4: minus? meaning T is present but not at 4? 

   And we don't have any other positions? 

   Therefore, the only possibility is that T is at position1 and C is at position4? 

   So the word is ""trace""

   But let me confirm: 
        trace: T R A C E? 
        Check against feedback:

        Guess 1: raise -> 
            T? not in? but we don't have T in raise? 
            Actually, we are comparing to the secret ""trace"":
                R: in secret at position2? but in raise at position1? -> minus? (correct, we got minus for R)
                A: in secret at position3? in raise at position2? -> minus? (correct)
                I: not in trace? -> x (correct)
                S: not in trace? -> x (correct)
                E: at position5? -> ✓ (correct)

        Guess 2: adore -> 
            A: in secret at position3? in adore at position1? -> minus? (correct)
            D: not in trace? -> x (correct)
            O: not in trace? -> x (correct)
            R: in secret at position2? in adore at position4? -> minus? (correct)
            E: at position5? -> ✓ (correct)

        Guess 3: brave -> 
            B: not in trace? -> x (correct)
            R: at position2? -> ✓ (correct)
            A: at position3? -> ✓ (correct)
            V: not in trace? -> x (correct)
            E: at position5? -> ✓ (correct)

        Guess 4: crate -> 
            C: in secret at position4? in crate at position1? -> minus? (correct)
            R: at position2? -> ✓ (correct)
            A: at position3? -> ✓ (correct)
            T: in secret at position1? in crate at position4? -> minus? (correct)
            E: at position5? -> ✓ (correct)

        So it matches.

   Therefore, the secret word is ""trace""

   So we can guess ""trace""

   But note: we are to make a new guess? and we have two more tries? 

   So we can output ""trace""

   However, if we are not sure? but the logic seems solid? 

   Alternatively, are there other possibilities? 
        What if the word has a letter we haven't guessed? 
        But we know the word must have C and T? and the positions? 

        For example, could the word be ""trice""? but I is excluded? 
        Or ""truce""? U? but we haven't excluded U? but let's check: 
            ""truce"": T R U C E? 
            But then position3 is U? but we have A fixed at position3? so no? 

        Or ""trace"" is the only common word? 

        Also, we have ""grace"": but in grace, position1 is G? and position4 is C? 
            Then in the feedback for crate: 
                C at position1: in grace, C is at position4? so we would get minus? 
                T at position4: in grace, position4 is C? so T is not present? so we would get x? 
            But we got T(-) meaning T is present? but grace does not have T? so that would be inconsistent? 

        Similarly, ""grate"": G R A T E? 
            Then in crate: 
                C at position1: not in grate? so should be x? but we got minus? meaning C is present? but grate has no C? 

        So ""grate"" would have given: 
            crate: 
                C: not in word? -> x? 
                R: ✓
                A: ✓
                T: in word? at position4? but in crate we put T at position4? and in grate T is at position4? so it would be ✓? 
                E: ✓
            So feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) 
            But we got T(-) meaning T is present but not at position4? so that doesn't match? 

        Therefore, the only word that fits is ""trace""

   So we guess ""trace""

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Pattern Established**: The secret word is `_ R A _ E` (positions 2, 3, 5 confirmed).  
2. **Key Insights from Guess 4 (""crate"")**:  
   - `C(-)` → `C` is in the word but **not at position 1**.  
   - `T(-)` → `T` is in the word but **not at position 4**.  
   - Eliminated letters: **B, D, I, O, S, V** (from prior guesses).  
3. **Deduction**:  
   - The only positions left are 1 and 4.  
   - `C` and `T` must occupy these positions, but:  
     - `C` cannot be at position 1 (feedback: `C(-)`).  
     - `T` cannot be at position 4 (feedback: `T(-)`).  
   - Thus, the **only valid arrangement** is:  
     - **Position 1**: `T`  
     - **Position 4**: `C`  
   - Resulting word: **`T R A C E`** (""trace"").  

### Verification with All Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""raise"")**:  
  - `R(-)`/`A(-)` → `R` and `A` present but misplaced (consistent with `TRACE`: `R` at pos2, `A` at pos3).  
  - `I(x)`/`S(x)` → Correctly absent.  
  - `E(✓)` → Confirmed pos5.  
- **Guess 2 (""adore"")**:  
  - `A(-)`/`R(-)` → Consistent (A not at pos1/2, R not at pos4).  
  - `D(x)`/`O(x)` → Correctly absent.  
- **Guess 3 (""brave"")**:  
  - `R(✓)`/`A(✓)`/`E(✓)` → Confirmed positions.  
  - `B(x)`/`V(x)` → Correctly absent.  
- **Guess 4 (""crate"")**:  
  - `C(-)`/`T(-)` → `C` not at pos1, `T` not at pos4 (consistent with `TRACE`: `T` at pos1, `C` at pos4).  

### Conclusion:
The secret word must be **TRACE**. This fits all constraints and feedback.

  - `A(-)`/`R(-)` → Consistent (A not at pos1/2, R not at pos4).  
  - `D(x)`/`O(x)` → Correctly absent.  
- **Guess 3 (""brave"")**:  
  - `R(✓)`/`A(✓)`/`E(✓)` → Confirmed positions.  
  - `B(x)`/`V(x)` → Correctly absent.  
- **Guess 4 (""crate"")**:  
  - `C(-)`/`T(-)` → `C` not at pos1, `T` not at pos4 (consistent with `TRACE`: `T` at pos1, `C` at pos4).  

### Conclusion:
The secret word must be **TRACE**. This fits all constraints and feedback.",Guess 5: trace -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) A(✓) C(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
