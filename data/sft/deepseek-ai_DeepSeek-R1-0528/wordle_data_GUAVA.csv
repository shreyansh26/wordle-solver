We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The third letter is A.
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the word has A in the third position and does not contain C, R, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has A in the third position.
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.
- Includes other common letters to test.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

We can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words that have A in the third position and use letters from the remaining set.

Possible words: 
- _ _ A _ _

We can try ""SALAD"" but that has two A's and we don't know if A appears twice? But in the feedback, we only have one A marked correct, but it could appear again. However, we don't have information about duplicates yet.

But note: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one A and it was correct, there might be more A's? But we don't know. We should avoid repeating A unless necessary? Actually, we can use A again to test, but it might be better to test new letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word like ""PLAIT"" but that has I and T which are new.

But let's list some words that fit:
- ""STAIR"": S, T, A, I, R -> but R is already excluded, so we cannot use R.
- ""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> all new letters? But we don't know if they are in the word.

We must avoid R because it's excluded. Also avoid C, R, N, E.

So, let's try to form a word without C, R, N, E and with A in the middle.

Options:
- ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D -> but two A's? And we have S, L, D to test. Also, the second A is in the last position? But we don't know if that's correct. However, we are allowed to use duplicate letters? The rules don't prohibit it, but the feedback might be tricky.

But note: the feedback for duplicate letters: if the word has two A's and we guess one A in the correct position and another A in a wrong position, then the first A would be ✓ and the second might be - or x? Actually, it depends. But in this case, we don't know if there is a second A.

Alternatively, we can choose a word without duplicate letters to avoid confusion.

Let me think of words with A in the third position and without C, R, N, E, and with distinct letters.

Examples:
- ""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A (fixed), 4:I, 5:T
- ""STAID"": S, T, A, I, D -> but we avoid R? This doesn't have R. S, T, A, I, D. But note: ""STAID"" is a word? Yes, meaning sober or serious.
- ""BLAZE"": B, L, A, Z, E -> but E is excluded, so we cannot use E.
- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> E is excluded.

So, we need to avoid E as well.

Another option: ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> but A is in the second position? We need A in the third. So, ""SALTY"" is S-A-L-T-Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:L -> not A in third.

We need the third letter to be A: so pattern: ??A??

Let me try: 
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> but Q and U are less common. Also, we haven't tested many common letters.
- ""MAVIS"": M, A, V, I, S -> again, A is second.

We need the third letter to be A. So:

- ""BOAST"": B, O, A, S, T -> A is third. And letters: B, O, S, T are new. But O is in the second position? The word is B-O-A-S-T. So, positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T.

But we don't have any restrictions on these letters. Also, we avoid C, R, N, E.

""BOAST"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""TOAST"": T, O, A, S, T -> has duplicate T? And we don't know if T is in the word.

But ""BOAST"" is better because all letters are distinct.

We could also try ""PLAID"": P, L, A, I, D -> distinct and avoids excluded letters.

Or ""BLAND"": but N is excluded, so no.

""PLAIT"" is good: P, L, A, I, T.

I think ""PLAIT"" or ""BOAST"" are good.

But let's consider the frequency of letters. We want to test common letters.

S, T, L are very common. So, ""PLAIT"" has P, L, I, T. L and T are common.

""BOAST"" has B, O, S, T. S and T are common.

We might also consider ""SLATE"" but E is excluded and A is not in the third? ""SLATE"" is S-L-A-T-E -> A is third, but E is excluded. So we cannot use that.

Another word: ""SHALT"" -> but that's old English? Not common.

""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A is second, not third.

We need to focus on words with A in the third.

Let me list a few more:
- ""CHAIR"": but C is excluded.
- ""TRAIN"": T, R, A, I, N -> R and N excluded.
- ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N -> N excluded.

So, without the excluded letters, we have:
- ""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T
- ""BOAST"": B, O, A, S, T
- ""SNAIL"": S, N, A, I, L -> but N excluded.
- ""ALARM"": A, L, A, R, M -> A is first? and R excluded.

Another one: ""ABACK"" -> but A is first and C excluded.

""ADAPT"": A, D, A, P, T -> A is first? and duplicate A.

""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E -> E excluded.

""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> A is first.

It's tricky. 

""OPALS"": O, P, A, L, S -> but A is third? O-P-A-L-S -> yes, positions: 1:O, 2:P, 3:A, 4:L, 5:S. And no excluded letters.

But ""OPALS"" is a word? Yes, plural of opal.

But we have two vowels? It's acceptable.

But we can also consider ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> A is second? P-A-S-T-A -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:A. So A is not in the third? We need the third letter to be A.

So, ""PASTA"" has A in second and fifth, not third.

Another word: ""DIARY"": D, I, A, R, Y -> R excluded.

""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y -> that's a word? Yes, a type of bread. Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y. And no excluded letters.

But it's a bit obscure.

""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> A is second.

I think ""PLAIT"" and ""BOAST"" are reasonable.

Let me choose ""PLAIT"" because it has more common consonants: P, L, T, and I.

So, second guess: ""PLAIT""

But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters, but we are testing with distinct letters to get clear feedback.

So, I'll go with ""plait"".

<guess>plait</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, marked with ""✓"").

Key insights for the next guess:
- The secret word has A as the 3rd letter (pattern: `__A__`).
- Avoid using C, R, N, or E, as they are confirmed absent.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, P) to gather more information.
- Prioritize words with distinct letters to maximize feedback clarity.

Considering these, ""plait"" is a strong choice:
- It fits the `__A__` pattern (3rd letter is A).
- It uses new, common letters (P, L, I, T) not yet tested.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, N, E).
- All letters are distinct, reducing ambiguity in feedback.

This guess will help identify the presence/position of P, L, I, and T, while confirming or ruling out duplicates for A.

But note: the feedback for duplicate letters: if the word has two A's and we guess one A in the correct position and another A in a wrong position, then the first A would be ✓ and the second might be - or x? Actually, it depends. But in this case, we don't know if there is a second A.

Alternatively, we can choose a word without duplicate letters to avoid confusion.

Let me think of words with A in the third position and without C, R, N, E, and with distinct letters.

Examples:
- ""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A (fixed), 4:I, 5:T
- ""STAID"": S, T, A, I, D -> but we avoid R? This doesn't have R. S, T, A, I, D. But note: ""STAID"" is a word? Yes, meaning sober or serious.
- ""BLAZE"": B, L, A, Z, E -> but E is excluded, so we cannot use E.
- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> E is excluded.

So, we need to avoid E as well.

Another option: ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> but A is in the second position? We need A in the third. So, ""SALTY"" is S-A-L-T-Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:L -> not A in third.

We need the third letter to be A: so pattern: ??A??

Let me try: 
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> but Q and U are less common. Also, we haven't tested many common letters.
- ""MAVIS"": M, A, V, I, S -> again, A is second.

We need the third letter to be A. So:

- ""BOAST"": B, O, A, S, T -> A is third. And letters: B, O, S, T are new. But O is in the second position? The word is B-O-A-S-T. So, positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T.

But we don't have any restrictions on these letters. Also, we avoid C, R, N, E.

""BOAST"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""TOAST"": T, O, A, S, T -> has duplicate T? And we don't know if T is in the word.

But ""BOAST"" is better because all letters are distinct.

We could also try ""PLAID"": P, L, A, I, D -> distinct and avoids excluded letters.

Or ""BLAND"": but N is excluded, so no.

""PLAIT"" is good: P, L, A, I, T.

I think ""PLAIT"" or ""BOAST"" are good.

But let's consider the frequency of letters. We want to test common letters.

S, T, L are very common. So, ""PLAIT"" has P, L, I, T. L and T are common.

""BOAST"" has B, O, S, T. S and T are common.

We might also consider ""SLATE"" but E is excluded and A is not in the third? ""SLATE"" is S-L-A-T-E -> A is third, but E is excluded. So we cannot use that.

Another word: ""SHALT"" -> but that's old English? Not common.

""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A is second, not third.

We need to focus on words with A in the third.

Let me list a few more:
- ""CHAIR"": but C is excluded.
- ""TRAIN"": T, R, A, I, N -> R and N excluded.
- ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N -> N excluded.

So, without the excluded letters, we have:
- ""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T
- ""BOAST"": B, O, A, S, T
- ""SNAIL"": S, N, A, I, L -> but N excluded.
- ""ALARM"": A, L, A, R, M -> A is first? and R excluded.

Another one: ""ABACK"" -> but A is first and C excluded.

""ADAPT"": A, D, A, P, T -> A is first? and duplicate A.

""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E -> E excluded.

""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> A is first.

It's tricky. 

""OPALS"": O, P, A, L, S -> but A is third? O-P-A-L-S -> yes, positions: 1:O, 2:P, 3:A, 4:L, 5:S. And no excluded letters.

But ""OPALS"" is a word? Yes, plural of opal.

But we have two vowels? It's acceptable.

But we can also consider ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> A is second? P-A-S-T-A -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:A. So A is not in the third? We need the third letter to be A.

So, ""PASTA"" has A in second and fifth, not third.

Another word: ""DIARY"": D, I, A, R, Y -> R excluded.

""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y -> that's a word? Yes, a type of bread. Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y. And no excluded letters.

But it's a bit obscure.

""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> A is second.

I think ""PLAIT"" and ""BOAST"" are reasonable.

Let me choose ""PLAIT"" because it has more common consonants: P, L, T, and I.

So, second guess: ""PLAIT""

But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters, but we are testing with distinct letters to get clear feedback.

So, I'll go with ""plait"".

<guess>plait</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, marked with ""✓"").

Key insights for the next guess:
- The secret word has A as the 3rd letter (pattern: `__A__`).
- Avoid using C, R, N, or E, as they are confirmed absent.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, P) to gather more information.
- Prioritize words with distinct letters to maximize feedback clarity.

Considering these, ""plait"" is a strong choice:
- It fits the `__A__` pattern (3rd letter is A).
- It uses new, common letters (P, L, I, T) not yet tested.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, N, E).
- All letters are distinct, reducing ambiguity in feedback.

This guess will help identify the presence/position of P, L, I, and T, while confirming or ruling out duplicates for A.

We have two guesses with feedback:
1. crane: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x) → So the third letter is A, and C, R, N, E are not in the word.
2. plait: P(x), L(x), A(✓), I(x), T(x) → So again, A is ✓ in the third position, and now P, L, I, T are not in the word.

Therefore, the word has the form: _ _ A _ _ 

And the letters not in the word so far are: C, R, N, E, P, L, I, T.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Has A in the third position.
- Uses only letters not in the excluded set: we must avoid C, R, N, E, P, L, I, T.
- Tests new common letters to gather more information.

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet, excluding the known absent letters.

Absent letters: C, E, I, L, N, P, R, T → So absent: C, E, I, L, N, P, R, T

Available letters: A, B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: A is already in the word (and we know it's in the third position), but it might appear elsewhere? We don't know. We should avoid using A again if possible, to test new letters, but it's acceptable if necessary.

Since we only have A at the third position, we can try words that might have A elsewhere? However, we don't have information about that. To avoid confusion, it's better to choose a word without A in other positions for now.

But the word must have A in the third position.

Also, we know from the first guess that there are no duplicates? Not necessarily: the feedback doesn't rule out duplicates because if there were another A, we wouldn't know since we guessed only one A. So it's possible to have duplicate letters.

But for the second guess ""plait"", we only had A in the third, so if there is another A elsewhere, we didn't test it.

For the next guess, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible from the available set.

Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
And vowels: O, U, etc. But A is already confirmed.

Common letters: S, O, U, B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Y

We should avoid uncommon letters like Q, J, X, Z if possible.

We need to form a word with the pattern: _ _ A _ _

And use letters from the available set.

Possible words:
- ""SAHAB"" → not English.
- ""SABHA"" → not common.
We need valid English words.

Let's think:
- ""BASAD"" → no.
- ""BASKS""? But S is available, but ""BASKS"" has two S's? And structure: B-A-S-K-S? But we need A in third? B-A-S-K-S: positions - 1:B, 2:A, 3:S → so A is second, not third.

We need the third letter to be A: so first two letters can be any consonants or vowels (but avoiding the absent letters), then A, then two more.

So: positions 1, 2: any from available (but must form a word), then A, then positions 4 and 5.

Examples of words with third letter A:
- ""ABACK"" → but A is first and C is excluded.
- ""ADAGE"" → E excluded.
- ""ADAPT"" → P and T excluded? P and T are in the absent list.

We have to avoid absent letters.

List without constraints: words like ""MANIA"" → M-A-N-I-A → but N and I are absent.
""BAGGY"" → B-A-G-G-Y → A is second.
""WAQFS"" → not English.

This is challenging. We need to find a word that doesn't use any of C,E,I,L,N,P,R,T.

Consider: ""SUMAC"" → C excluded.
""DOGMA"" → D-O-G-M-A → structure: D (1), O (2), G (3)? No, it's D-O-G-M-A, so letter 3 is G? We need letter 3 to be A.

Another one: ""FOCAL"" → C and L excluded.

""SOAPY"": S-O-A-P-Y → but P is excluded and A is third? S(1), O(2), A(3), P(4), Y(5). So yes! But P is already excluded from guess 2 (P(x)). So we cannot use P.

Similarly, ""SHOAL"" → L excluded.

""BOCCA"" → C excluded.

Perhaps words ending with A? Like ""PIZZA"", but P and I excluded, and A is fifth.

We need A in third.

Another idea: ""BAZAAR"" too long.

5-letter words: how about ""KARST""? K-A-R-S-T? But A is second? K(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). Not third.

""QUAKE"" → Q-U-A-K-E. U is available? But E is excluded and A is third? Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). E excluded.

But we can try ""QUARK"" → Q-U-A-R-K → R excluded.

But perhaps ""QUAGM"" not a word.

List available vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y.

Words: 
- ""JUMAR"" → J is not common, R excluded.
- ""DUCAL"" → L excluded and D-U-C-A-L → C excluded?
Pattern: D(1), U(2), C(3)? Not A.

We need to search or think differently.

What about ""SWAMI""? S-W-A-M-I → I excluded? And A is third? S(1), W(2), A(3), M(4), I(5). I is excluded.

""MAMBA"" → M-A-M-B-A → A is second and third? M(1), A(2), M(3), B(4), A(5). So position 3 is M? Or A? The third letter is M? Actually: word MAMBA: positions: 1-M, 2-A, 3-M, 4-B, 5-A. So A is in second and fifth, but third is M.

We need position 3 to be A.

Another word: ""AWASH"" → A-W-A-S-H → position:1-A,2-W,3-A? Then 4-S,5-H. So third letter is A? Yes: A(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So ""awash"" has A in the third position. And letters: A, W, S, H. But we already have A known, so we are using A twice? And we need to avoid absent letters: check: A is in the word, but we know it, W, S, H are not tested yet.

But ""awash"" is a valid word. And it contains two A's, but that's okay.

Letters: A is confirmed present, W, S, H are new and allowed since not in absent list.

Absent list: C, E, I, L, N, P, R, T. So W, S, H are free.

The word ""awash"" has A in position 1 or 2? In this case, position 1 is A, position 3 is A. But we know position 3 is A, so the fourth and fifth are S and H? Actually, the pattern is: position 1: A, position 3: A. But we don't know if position 1 is correct? We'll get feedback.

Also, we are introducing S and H.

Perhaps a better word without reusing A? But since we know A is present, it's acceptable to have A in another position if necessary. But here, position 1 is A, which might be correct or not.

But we have to include A at position 3.

Another word: ""SHADY"" → S-H-A-D-Y. Positions: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), Y(5). So it perfectly fits, and only S, H, D, Y, with A in third.

And the letters: S, H, D, Y are available, not excluded.

Is ""SHADY"" valid? Yes.

Similarly, ""SHAKY"" → S-H-A-K-Y. Also possible.

Or ""SHAGY""? Not a word.

Or ""BAWDY"" → B-A-W-D-Y? A is second? B(1), A(2), W(3)? Not third.

""SHADY"" seems good.

Another option: ""SWAMP"" -> P excluded.

""OASIS"" -> O-A-S-I-S → I excluded and A is second.

""CHASM"" -> C, H, A, S, M → C excluded.

""AUDIO"" -> A-U-D-I-O → I and O? Positions: A(1), U(2), D(3)? Not A at third.

""GAUDY"" -> G-A-U-D-Y → A second? G(1), A(2), U(3), D(4), Y(5). Not third.

""JAWAB"" -> J and perhaps rare.

So ""SHADY"" is a valid and common word.

How about ""SHADY"": letters S, H, A, D, Y.

Advantage: it tests S, H, D, Y, and confirms if A is duplicated? But we are testing S, H, D, Y.

It avoids all excluded letters.

I think ""SHADY"" is a good choice.

Another common word: ""SASSY"" but two S's and A not in third? S-A-S-S-Y → A second.

""SHADY"" seems appropriate.

We could consider ""KHADI"" but K and H, but also D and I? I is excluded.

No.

""WHAMO"" not word.

So, I'll go with ""SHADY"".

Therefore, third guess: SHADY

<guess>shady</guess>
</think>
After reviewing the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x). This reveals that:
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: plait** → Feedback: P(x), L(x), A(✓), I(x), T(x). This confirms:
  - A is still correctly placed (3rd letter), reinforcing the pattern `__A__`.
  - P, L, I, T are not in the word.

Combined absent letters: **C, E, I, L, N, P, R, T**.  
Confirmed present: **A (3rd position)**.  

The current pattern is fixed: `__A__`.  
Available letters (excluding absent letters): A, B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Prioritize testing new common letters** to maximize information, focusing on consonants like S, D, H, Y, as they appear frequently in English words.
- **Avoid reusing absent letters** to prevent redundant feedback.
- **Maintain distinct letters** where possible to clarify feedback, though A is reused in the required 3rd position.
- **Word choice**: ""SHADY"" fits well:
  - Pattern: `S H A D Y` → 3rd letter is A (ensured).
  - Tests letters: S, H, D, Y (all new and common).
  - Valid English word (meaning ""of questionable character or quality"").

This guess will help identify the presence/position of S, H, D, and Y while confirming if A appears elsewhere.

<guess>shady</guess>",shady,"We have two guesses with feedback:
1. crane: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x) → So the third letter is A, and C, R, N, E are not in the word.
2. plait: P(x), L(x), A(✓), I(x), T(x) → So again, A is ✓ in the third position, and now P, L, I, T are not in the word.

Therefore, the word has the form: _ _ A _ _ 

And the letters not in the word so far are: C, R, N, E, P, L, I, T.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Has A in the third position.
- Uses only letters not in the excluded set: we must avoid C, R, N, E, P, L, I, T.
- Tests new common letters to gather more information.

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet, excluding the known absent letters.

Absent letters: C, E, I, L, N, P, R, T → So absent: C, E, I, L, N, P, R, T

Available letters: A, B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: A is already in the word (and we know it's in the third position), but it might appear elsewhere? We don't know. We should avoid using A again if possible, to test new letters, but it's acceptable if necessary.

Since we only have A at the third position, we can try words that might have A elsewhere? However, we don't have information about that. To avoid confusion, it's better to choose a word without A in other positions for now.

But the word must have A in the third position.

Also, we know from the first guess that there are no duplicates? Not necessarily: the feedback doesn't rule out duplicates because if there were another A, we wouldn't know since we guessed only one A. So it's possible to have duplicate letters.

But for the second guess ""plait"", we only had A in the third, so if there is another A elsewhere, we didn't test it.

For the next guess, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible from the available set.

Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
And vowels: O, U, etc. But A is already confirmed.

Common letters: S, O, U, B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Y

We should avoid uncommon letters like Q, J, X, Z if possible.

We need to form a word with the pattern: _ _ A _ _

And use letters from the available set.

Possible words:
- ""SAHAB"" → not English.
- ""SABHA"" → not common.
We need valid English words.

Let's think:
- ""BASAD"" → no.
- ""BASKS""? But S is available, but ""BASKS"" has two S's? And structure: B-A-S-K-S? But we need A in third? B-A-S-K-S: positions - 1:B, 2:A, 3:S → so A is second, not third.

We need the third letter to be A: so first two letters can be any consonants or vowels (but avoiding the absent letters), then A, then two more.

So: positions 1, 2: any from available (but must form a word), then A, then positions 4 and 5.

Examples of words with third letter A:
- ""ABACK"" → but A is first and C is excluded.
- ""ADAGE"" → E excluded.
- ""ADAPT"" → P and T excluded? P and T are in the absent list.

We have to avoid absent letters.

List without constraints: words like ""MANIA"" → M-A-N-I-A → but N and I are absent.
""BAGGY"" → B-A-G-G-Y → A is second.
""WAQFS"" → not English.

This is challenging. We need to find a word that doesn't use any of C,E,I,L,N,P,R,T.

Consider: ""SUMAC"" → C excluded.
""DOGMA"" → D-O-G-M-A → structure: D (1), O (2), G (3)? No, it's D-O-G-M-A, so letter 3 is G? We need letter 3 to be A.

Another one: ""FOCAL"" → C and L excluded.

""SOAPY"": S-O-A-P-Y → but P is excluded and A is third? S(1), O(2), A(3), P(4), Y(5). So yes! But P is already excluded from guess 2 (P(x)). So we cannot use P.

Similarly, ""SHOAL"" → L excluded.

""BOCCA"" → C excluded.

Perhaps words ending with A? Like ""PIZZA"", but P and I excluded, and A is fifth.

We need A in third.

Another idea: ""BAZAAR"" too long.

5-letter words: how about ""KARST""? K-A-R-S-T? But A is second? K(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). Not third.

""QUAKE"" → Q-U-A-K-E. U is available? But E is excluded and A is third? Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). E excluded.

But we can try ""QUARK"" → Q-U-A-R-K → R excluded.

But perhaps ""QUAGM"" not a word.

List available vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y.

Words: 
- ""JUMAR"" → J is not common, R excluded.
- ""DUCAL"" → L excluded and D-U-C-A-L → C excluded?
Pattern: D(1), U(2), C(3)? Not A.

We need to search or think differently.

What about ""SWAMI""? S-W-A-M-I → I excluded? And A is third? S(1), W(2), A(3), M(4), I(5). I is excluded.

""MAMBA"" → M-A-M-B-A → A is second and third? M(1), A(2), M(3), B(4), A(5). So position 3 is M? Or A? The third letter is M? Actually: word MAMBA: positions: 1-M, 2-A, 3-M, 4-B, 5-A. So A is in second and fifth, but third is M.

We need position 3 to be A.

Another word: ""AWASH"" → A-W-A-S-H → position:1-A,2-W,3-A? Then 4-S,5-H. So third letter is A? Yes: A(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So ""awash"" has A in the third position. And letters: A, W, S, H. But we already have A known, so we are using A twice? And we need to avoid absent letters: check: A is in the word, but we know it, W, S, H are not tested yet.

But ""awash"" is a valid word. And it contains two A's, but that's okay.

Letters: A is confirmed present, W, S, H are new and allowed since not in absent list.

Absent list: C, E, I, L, N, P, R, T. So W, S, H are free.

The word ""awash"" has A in position 1 or 2? In this case, position 1 is A, position 3 is A. But we know position 3 is A, so the fourth and fifth are S and H? Actually, the pattern is: position 1: A, position 3: A. But we don't know if position 1 is correct? We'll get feedback.

Also, we are introducing S and H.

Perhaps a better word without reusing A? But since we know A is present, it's acceptable to have A in another position if necessary. But here, position 1 is A, which might be correct or not.

But we have to include A at position 3.

Another word: ""SHADY"" → S-H-A-D-Y. Positions: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), Y(5). So it perfectly fits, and only S, H, D, Y, with A in third.

And the letters: S, H, D, Y are available, not excluded.

Is ""SHADY"" valid? Yes.

Similarly, ""SHAKY"" → S-H-A-K-Y. Also possible.

Or ""SHAGY""? Not a word.

Or ""BAWDY"" → B-A-W-D-Y? A is second? B(1), A(2), W(3)? Not third.

""SHADY"" seems good.

Another option: ""SWAMP"" -> P excluded.

""OASIS"" -> O-A-S-I-S → I excluded and A is second.

""CHASM"" -> C, H, A, S, M → C excluded.

""AUDIO"" -> A-U-D-I-O → I and O? Positions: A(1), U(2), D(3)? Not A at third.

""GAUDY"" -> G-A-U-D-Y → A second? G(1), A(2), U(3), D(4), Y(5). Not third.

""JAWAB"" -> J and perhaps rare.

So ""SHADY"" is a valid and common word.

How about ""SHADY"": letters S, H, A, D, Y.

Advantage: it tests S, H, D, Y, and confirms if A is duplicated? But we are testing S, H, D, Y.

It avoids all excluded letters.

I think ""SHADY"" is a good choice.

Another common word: ""SASSY"" but two S's and A not in third? S-A-S-S-Y → A second.

""SHADY"" seems appropriate.

We could consider ""KHADI"" but K and H, but also D and I? I is excluded.

No.

""WHAMO"" not word.

So, I'll go with ""SHADY"".

Therefore, third guess: SHADY

<guess>shady</guess>After reviewing the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x). This reveals that:
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: plait** → Feedback: P(x), L(x), A(✓), I(x), T(x). This confirms:
  - A is still correctly placed (3rd letter), reinforcing the pattern `__A__`.
  - P, L, I, T are not in the word.

Combined absent letters: **C, E, I, L, N, P, R, T**.  
Confirmed present: **A (3rd position)**.  

The current pattern is fixed: `__A__`.  
Available letters (excluding absent letters): A, B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Prioritize testing new common letters** to maximize information, focusing on consonants like S, D, H, Y, as they appear frequently in English words.
- **Avoid reusing absent letters** to prevent redundant feedback.
- **Maintain distinct letters** where possible to clarify feedback, though A is reused in the required 3rd position.
- **Word choice**: ""SHADY"" fits well:
  - Pattern: `S H A D Y` → 3rd letter is A (ensured).
  - Tests letters: S, H, D, Y (all new and common).
  - Valid English word (meaning ""of questionable character or quality"").

This guess will help identify the presence/position of S, H, D, and Y while confirming if A appears elsewhere.",Guess 3: shady -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(x) A(✓) D(x) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,GUAVA,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The third letter is A.
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the word has A in the third position and does not contain C, R, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has A in the third position.
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.
- Includes other common letters to test.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

We can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words that have A in the third position and use letters from the remaining set.

Possible words: 
- _ _ A _ _

We can try ""SALAD"" but that has two A's and we don't know if A appears twice? But in the feedback, we only have one A marked correct, but it could appear again. However, we don't have information about duplicates yet.

But note: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one A and it was correct, there might be more A's? But we don't know. We should avoid repeating A unless necessary? Actually, we can use A again to test, but it might be better to test new letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word like ""PLAIT"" but that has I and T which are new.

But let's list some words that fit:
- ""STAIR"": S, T, A, I, R -> but R is already excluded, so we cannot use R.
- ""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> all new letters? But we don't know if they are in the word.

We must avoid R because it's excluded. Also avoid C, R, N, E.

So, let's try to form a word without C, R, N, E and with A in the middle.

Options:
- ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D -> but two A's? And we have S, L, D to test. Also, the second A is in the last position? But we don't know if that's correct. However, we are allowed to use duplicate letters? The rules don't prohibit it, but the feedback might be tricky.

But note: the feedback for duplicate letters: if the word has two A's and we guess one A in the correct position and another A in a wrong position, then the first A would be ✓ and the second might be - or x? Actually, it depends. But in this case, we don't know if there is a second A.

Alternatively, we can choose a word without duplicate letters to avoid confusion.

Let me think of words with A in the third position and without C, R, N, E, and with distinct letters.

Examples:
- ""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A (fixed), 4:I, 5:T
- ""STAID"": S, T, A, I, D -> but we avoid R? This doesn't have R. S, T, A, I, D. But note: ""STAID"" is a word? Yes, meaning sober or serious.
- ""BLAZE"": B, L, A, Z, E -> but E is excluded, so we cannot use E.
- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> E is excluded.

So, we need to avoid E as well.

Another option: ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> but A is in the second position? We need A in the third. So, ""SALTY"" is S-A-L-T-Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:L -> not A in third.

We need the third letter to be A: so pattern: ??A??

Let me try: 
- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> but Q and U are less common. Also, we haven't tested many common letters.
- ""MAVIS"": M, A, V, I, S -> again, A is second.

We need the third letter to be A. So:

- ""BOAST"": B, O, A, S, T -> A is third. And letters: B, O, S, T are new. But O is in the second position? The word is B-O-A-S-T. So, positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T.

But we don't have any restrictions on these letters. Also, we avoid C, R, N, E.

""BOAST"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""TOAST"": T, O, A, S, T -> has duplicate T? And we don't know if T is in the word.

But ""BOAST"" is better because all letters are distinct.

We could also try ""PLAID"": P, L, A, I, D -> distinct and avoids excluded letters.

Or ""BLAND"": but N is excluded, so no.

""PLAIT"" is good: P, L, A, I, T.

I think ""PLAIT"" or ""BOAST"" are good.

But let's consider the frequency of letters. We want to test common letters.

S, T, L are very common. So, ""PLAIT"" has P, L, I, T. L and T are common.

""BOAST"" has B, O, S, T. S and T are common.

We might also consider ""SLATE"" but E is excluded and A is not in the third? ""SLATE"" is S-L-A-T-E -> A is third, but E is excluded. So we cannot use that.

Another word: ""SHALT"" -> but that's old English? Not common.

""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A is second, not third.

We need to focus on words with A in the third.

Let me list a few more:
- ""CHAIR"": but C is excluded.
- ""TRAIN"": T, R, A, I, N -> R and N excluded.
- ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N -> N excluded.

So, without the excluded letters, we have:
- ""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T
- ""BOAST"": B, O, A, S, T
- ""SNAIL"": S, N, A, I, L -> but N excluded.
- ""ALARM"": A, L, A, R, M -> A is first? and R excluded.

Another one: ""ABACK"" -> but A is first and C excluded.

""ADAPT"": A, D, A, P, T -> A is first? and duplicate A.

""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E -> E excluded.

""AVAIL"": A, V, A, I, L -> A is first.

It's tricky. 

""OPALS"": O, P, A, L, S -> but A is third? O-P-A-L-S -> yes, positions: 1:O, 2:P, 3:A, 4:L, 5:S. And no excluded letters.

But ""OPALS"" is a word? Yes, plural of opal.

But we have two vowels? It's acceptable.

But we can also consider ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> A is second? P-A-S-T-A -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:A. So A is not in the third? We need the third letter to be A.

So, ""PASTA"" has A in second and fifth, not third.

Another word: ""DIARY"": D, I, A, R, Y -> R excluded.

""BIALY"": B, I, A, L, Y -> that's a word? Yes, a type of bread. Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y. And no excluded letters.

But it's a bit obscure.

""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> A is second.

I think ""PLAIT"" and ""BOAST"" are reasonable.

Let me choose ""PLAIT"" because it has more common consonants: P, L, T, and I.

So, second guess: ""PLAIT""

But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters, but we are testing with distinct letters to get clear feedback.

So, I'll go with ""plait"".

<guess>plait</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, marked with ""✓"").

Key insights for the next guess:
- The secret word has A as the 3rd letter (pattern: `__A__`).
- Avoid using C, R, N, or E, as they are confirmed absent.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, P) to gather more information.
- Prioritize words with distinct letters to maximize feedback clarity.

Considering these, ""plait"" is a strong choice:
- It fits the `__A__` pattern (3rd letter is A).
- It uses new, common letters (P, L, I, T) not yet tested.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, N, E).
- All letters are distinct, reducing ambiguity in feedback.

This guess will help identify the presence/position of P, L, I, and T, while confirming or ruling out duplicates for A.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Has A in the third position.
- Uses only letters not in the excluded set: we must avoid C, R, N, E, P, L, I, T.
- Tests new common letters to gather more information.

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet, excluding the known absent letters.

Absent letters: C, E, I, L, N, P, R, T → So absent: C, E, I, L, N, P, R, T

Available letters: A, B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: A is already in the word (and we know it's in the third position), but it might appear elsewhere? We don't know. We should avoid using A again if possible, to test new letters, but it's acceptable if necessary.

""MAMBA"" → M-A-M-B-A → A is second and third? M(1), A(2), M(3), B(4), A(5). So position 3 is M? Or A? The third letter is M? Actually: word MAMBA: positions: 1-M, 2-A, 3-M, 4-B, 5-A. So A is in second and fifth, but third is M.

We need position 3 to be A.

Another word: ""AWASH"" → A-W-A-S-H → position:1-A,2-W,3-A? Then 4-S,5-H. So third letter is A? Yes: A(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So ""awash"" has A in the third position. And letters: A, W, S, H. But we already have A known, so we are using A twice? And we need to avoid absent letters: check: A is in the word, but we know it, W, S, H are not tested yet.

The word ""awash"" has A in position 1 or 2? In this case, position 1 is A, position 3 is A. But we know position 3 is A, so the fourth and fifth are S and H? Actually, the pattern is: position 1: A, position 3: A. But we don't know if position 1 is correct? We'll get feedback.

Also, we are introducing S and H.

Perhaps a better word without reusing A? But since we know A is present, it's acceptable to have A in another position if necessary. But here, position 1 is A, which might be correct or not.

But we have to include A at position 3.

Another word: ""SHADY"" → S-H-A-D-Y. Positions: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), Y(5). So it perfectly fits, and only S, H, D, Y, with A in third.

And the letters: S, H, D, Y are available, not excluded.

Is ""SHADY"" valid? Yes.

Similarly, ""SHAKY"" → S-H-A-K-Y. Also possible.

Or ""SHAGY""? Not a word.

Or ""BAWDY"" → B-A-W-D-Y? A is second? B(1), A(2), W(3)? Not third.

""SHADY"" seems good.

Another option: ""SWAMP"" -> P excluded.

""OASIS"" -> O-A-S-I-S → I excluded and A is second.

""CHASM"" -> C, H, A, S, M → C excluded.

""AUDIO"" -> A-U-D-I-O → I and O? Positions: A(1), U(2), D(3)? Not A at third.

""GAUDY"" -> G-A-U-D-Y → A second? G(1), A(2), U(3), D(4), Y(5). Not third.

""JAWAB"" -> J and perhaps rare.

So ""SHADY"" is a valid and common word.

How about ""SHADY"": letters S, H, A, D, Y.

Advantage: it tests S, H, D, Y, and confirms if A is duplicated? But we are testing S, H, D, Y.

It avoids all excluded letters.

I think ""SHADY"" is a good choice.

Another common word: ""SASSY"" but two S's and A not in third? S-A-S-S-Y → A second.

""SHADY"" seems appropriate.

We could consider ""KHADI"" but K and H, but also D and I? I is excluded.

No.

""WHAMO"" not word.

So, I'll go with ""SHADY"".

Therefore, third guess: SHADY

<guess>shady</guess>After reviewing the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x). This reveals that:
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: plait** → Feedback: P(x), L(x), A(✓), I(x), T(x). This confirms:
  - A is still correctly placed (3rd letter), reinforcing the pattern `__A__`.
  - P, L, I, T are not in the word.

Combined absent letters: **C, E, I, L, N, P, R, T**.  
Confirmed present: **A (3rd position)**.  

The current pattern is fixed: `__A__`.  
Available letters (excluding absent letters): A, B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Prioritize testing new common letters** to maximize information, focusing on consonants like S, D, H, Y, as they appear frequently in English words.
- **Avoid reusing absent letters** to prevent redundant feedback.
- **Maintain distinct letters** where possible to clarify feedback, though A is reused in the required 3rd position.
- **Word choice**: ""SHADY"" fits well:
  - Pattern: `S H A D Y` → 3rd letter is A (ensured).
  - Tests letters: S, H, D, Y (all new and common).
  - Valid English word (meaning ""of questionable character or quality"").

This guess will help identify the presence/position of S, H, D, and Y while confirming if A appears elsewhere.

But in the feedback, we only have one A marked correct, but it could appear again. However, we don\'t have information about duplicates yet.\n\nBut note: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one A and it was correct, there might be more A\'s? But we don\'t know. We should avoid repeating A unless necessary? Actually, we can use A again to test, but it might be better to test new letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word like ""PLAIT"" but that has I and T which are new.\n\nBut let\'s list some words that fit:\n- ""STAIR"": S, T, A, I, R -> but R is already excluded, so we cannot use R.\n- ""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> all new letters? But we don\'t know if they are in the word.\n\nWe must avoid R because it\'s excluded.

Also, the second A is in the last position? But we don\'t know if that\'s correct. However, we are allowed to use duplicate letters? The rules don\'t prohibit it, but the feedback might be tricky.\n\nBut note: the feedback for duplicate letters: if the word has two A\'s and we guess one A in the correct position and another A in a wrong position, then the first A would be ✓ and the second might be - or x? Actually, it depends. But in this case, we don\'t know if there is a second A.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word without duplicate letters to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me think of words with A in the third position and without C, R, N, E, and with distinct letters.\n\nExamples:\n- ""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A (fixed), 4:I, 5:T\n- ""STAID"": S, T, A, I, D -> but we avoid R? This doesn\'t have R. S, T, A, I, D. But note: ""STAID"" is a word?

So, ""SALTY"" is S-A-L-T-Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:L -> not A in third.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A: so pattern: ??A??\n\nLet me try: \n- ""QUAIL"": Q, U, A, I, L -> but Q and U are less common. Also, we haven\'t tested many common letters.\n- ""MAVIS"": M, A, V, I, S -> again, A is second.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A. So:\n\n- ""BOAST"": B, O, A, S, T -> A is third. And letters: B, O, S, T are new. But O is in the second position? The word is B-O-A-S-T. So, positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T.\n\nBut we don\'t have any restrictions on these letters. Also, we avoid C, R, N, E.\n\n""BOAST"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother option: ""TOAST"": T, O, A, S, T -> has duplicate T? And we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n\nBut ""BOAST"" is better because all letters are distinct.\n\nWe could also try ""PLAID"": P, L, A, I, D -> distinct and avoids excluded letters.\n\nOr ""BLAND"": but N is excluded, so no.\n\n""PLAIT"" is good: P, L, A, I, T.\n\nI think ""PLAIT"" or ""BOAST"" are good.\n\nBut let\'s consider the frequency of letters. We want to test common letters.\n\nS, T, L are very common. So, ""PLAIT"" has P, L, I, T. L and T are common.\n\n""BOAST"" has B, O, S, T. S and T are common.\n\nWe might also consider ""SLATE"" but E is excluded and A is not in the third? ""SLATE"" is S-L-A-T-E -> A is third, but E is excluded.

It\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we can also consider ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> A is second? P-A-S-T-A -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:A. So A is not in the third?

Yes, a type of bread. Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:A, 4:L, 5:Y.

We have three guesses with feedback:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x) → A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd). C, R, N, E are absent.
2. ""plait"": P(x), L(x), A(✓), I(x), T(x) → A is again confirmed in the 3rd position. P, L, I, T are absent.
3. ""shady"": S(x), H(x), A(✓), D(x), Y(x) → A is still in the 3rd position. S, H, D, Y are absent.

So, the word has the form: _ _ A _ _ 

And the absent letters are: C, E, I, L, N, P, R, T, S, H, D, Y.

Now, the list of absent letters: C, D, E, H, I, L, N, P, R, S, T, Y.

Available letters: A, B, F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But note: A is already in the word at position 3, but it might appear elsewhere? We don't know. We should avoid using A again if possible to test new letters, but it's acceptable if necessary.

We must form a word with A in the third position and using only the available letters.

Pattern: _ _ A _ _

Available letters: A, B, F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to choose a word that uses these letters and has A in the third position.

Possible words? Let's think:

- ""JUMAR""? Not common, and J is not very common.
- ""FACED""? But C and E are absent.
- ""GAMMA""? G-A-M-M-A → A is second? G(1), A(2), M(3)? Not A at third. Also, M is at third.

We need the third letter to be A.

""BAZAAR"" is 6 letters.

""KAPPA""? K-A-P-P-A → A is second? K(1), A(2), P(3)? P is absent.

""JAZZY""? J-A-Z-Z-Y → A is second? J(1), A(2), Z(3)? But Y is absent.

""QUAFF""? Q-U-A-F-F → Q(1), U(2), A(3), F(4), F(5). So A is third. And letters: Q, U, F, F. But F is available? Yes, F is not in absent list. But ""quaff"" is a word (meaning to drink heartily).

But it has two F's? That might be okay.

Letters: Q, U, A, F. We are testing Q, U, F.

But Q and U are less common, but possible.

Another word: ""QUAKY""? Not common, and Y is absent.

""QUAGM""? Not a word.

""WAQFS""? Not common.

""FAUNA""? F-A-U-N-A → N is absent? N is in absent list.

""MAUVE""? M-A-U-V-E → E absent.

""JAUPS""? Not common.

""BAVIN""? N absent.

""KAVAS""? S absent? S is absent.

""MAWKY""? Y absent.

""GAUZY""? Y and Z? G-A-U-Z-Y → A is second? G(1), A(2), U(3)? Not A at third.

We need to focus on words with A in the third.

""ABAFT""? A-B-A-F-T → A is first? A(1), B(2), A(3), F(4), T(5). T is absent.

""AGAMA""? A-G-A-M-A → A is first? A(1), G(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). So A at third. But we have multiple A's. Letters: A, G, M. G and M are available. But the word ""agama"" is a type of lizard, so valid.

But we are reusing A, but that's okay.

Pattern: positions 1,2,3,4,5: A, G, A, M, A? No: the word is A-G-A-M-A, so:
Position 1: A
Position 2: G
Position 3: A (which we know is correct)
Position 4: M
Position 5: A

So we are testing A at positions 1,4,5? But we know position 3 is A, so we are testing if there are A's elsewhere.

But we are also testing G and M.

Another word: ""BABKA""? B-A-B-K-A → A is second? B(1), A(2), B(3), K(4), A(5). Not A at third.

""KABAB""? K-A-B-A-B → A is second? K(1), A(2), B(3), A(4), B(5). Not third.

""JABOT""? J-A-B-O-T → A is second? J(1), A(2), B(3), O(4), T(5). T absent.

""OAKUM""? O-A-K-U-M → A is second? O(1), A(2), K(3), U(4), M(5). Not third.

""GUAVA""? G-U-A-V-A → U(1), G(2)? Wait: G-U-A-V-A → positions: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A. So A at third and fifth. And letters: G, U, V, A. G, U, V are available.

""Guava"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""quaff"" as I thought earlier.

""Guava"" might be better because it has more common letters? But U and V are not the most common, but it's acceptable.

Another word: ""UMIAC""? Not common.

""VAGUS""? V-A-G-U-S → S absent.

""JUMAR""? J-U-M-A-R → R absent.

So, ""guava"" or ""quaff"".

But ""guava"" has two A's, which might be useful to test for duplicate A's.

We could also consider ""BAUDS""? But D and S absent.

""FAUGH""? F-A-U-G-H → H absent? H is absent from guess 3.

""GAUMS""? S absent.

""QUASS""? S absent.

""WAUGH""? W-A-U-G-H → H absent.

So, let's go with ""guava"".

But note: in ""guava"", the first letter is G, second U, third A (correct), fourth V, fifth A.

We are testing G, U, V, and A at positions 1,4,5.

Since we know A is at 3, if we get feedback for A at 1,4,5, it will tell us if there are additional A's.

But we are using three A's? The word ""guava"" has three A's? G-U-A-V-A: positions 3 and 5 are A, and position 1 is G, 2 is U, 4 is V. So two A's: at 3 and 5.

We are testing U at position 2, G at 1, V at 4, and A at 5.

But we already know A at 3 is correct, so we are only testing the other positions.

I think ""guava"" is a valid choice.

Another option: ""JAZZY"" but A is second.

""QUACK"" C absent.

""QUAKE"" E absent.

""QUALM"" L absent? L is absent.

""QUART"" R and T absent.

""QUASH"" S and H absent.

So, ""guava"" seems one of the few options.

We could try ""BAFFY""? B-A-F-F-Y → Y absent and A second.

""MAFFIA""? I and A? M-A-F-F-I-A → I absent.

""GAFFS""? S absent.

""WAFFS""? S absent.

""JAUKS""? S absent.

So, I think ""guava"" is acceptable.

Therefore, fourth guess: GUAVA

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(absent), R(absent), A(correct position, 3rd), N(absent), E(absent).  
  - **Key takeaway**: A is in the word and fixed at position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.  
- **Guess 2: ""plait""** → Feedback: P(absent), L(absent), A(correct position, 3rd), I(absent), T(absent).  
  - **Key takeaway**: A is confirmed at position 3. P, L, I, T are absent.  
- **Guess 3: ""shady""** → Feedback: S(absent), H(absent), A(correct position, 3rd), D(absent), Y(absent).  
  - **Key takeaway**: A is confirmed at position 3. S, H, D, Y are absent.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Pattern**: The word must be `_ _ A _ _` (A is the 3rd letter).  
- **Absent letters**: C, D, E, H, I, L, N, P, R, S, T, Y (12 letters eliminated).  
- **Available letters**: A, B, F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
  - A is confirmed present but may appear elsewhere (duplicates possible).  
- **Strategy for next guess**:  
  - Must include A in the 3rd position.  
  - Use only available letters to test new possibilities.  
  - Prioritize common letters (e.g., B, F, G, M, O, U) to maximize information.  
  - Given limited options, reuse A if necessary to test other positions (e.g., position 1, 4, or 5).  

### Word Selection:
After evaluating possible words, **""guava""** is chosen because:  
- Fits the `_ _ A _ _` pattern (3rd letter is A).  
- Uses new available letters: G, U, V (tests their presence/position).  
- Reuses A at position 5 to check for duplicates.  
- Avoids all absent letters.  
- Valid English word (meaning a tropical fruit).  

This guess will help identify if G, U, or V are in the word, and if A appears again (e.g., at position 5).  

<guess>guava</guess>",guava,"We have three guesses with feedback:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x) → A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd). C, R, N, E are absent.
2. ""plait"": P(x), L(x), A(✓), I(x), T(x) → A is again confirmed in the 3rd position. P, L, I, T are absent.
3. ""shady"": S(x), H(x), A(✓), D(x), Y(x) → A is still in the 3rd position. S, H, D, Y are absent.

So, the word has the form: _ _ A _ _ 

And the absent letters are: C, E, I, L, N, P, R, T, S, H, D, Y.

Now, the list of absent letters: C, D, E, H, I, L, N, P, R, S, T, Y.

Available letters: A, B, F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But note: A is already in the word at position 3, but it might appear elsewhere? We don't know. We should avoid using A again if possible to test new letters, but it's acceptable if necessary.

We must form a word with A in the third position and using only the available letters.

Pattern: _ _ A _ _

Available letters: A, B, F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to choose a word that uses these letters and has A in the third position.

Possible words? Let's think:

- ""JUMAR""? Not common, and J is not very common.
- ""FACED""? But C and E are absent.
- ""GAMMA""? G-A-M-M-A → A is second? G(1), A(2), M(3)? Not A at third. Also, M is at third.

We need the third letter to be A.

""BAZAAR"" is 6 letters.

""KAPPA""? K-A-P-P-A → A is second? K(1), A(2), P(3)? P is absent.

""JAZZY""? J-A-Z-Z-Y → A is second? J(1), A(2), Z(3)? But Y is absent.

""QUAFF""? Q-U-A-F-F → Q(1), U(2), A(3), F(4), F(5). So A is third. And letters: Q, U, F, F. But F is available? Yes, F is not in absent list. But ""quaff"" is a word (meaning to drink heartily).

But it has two F's? That might be okay.

Letters: Q, U, A, F. We are testing Q, U, F.

But Q and U are less common, but possible.

Another word: ""QUAKY""? Not common, and Y is absent.

""QUAGM""? Not a word.

""WAQFS""? Not common.

""FAUNA""? F-A-U-N-A → N is absent? N is in absent list.

""MAUVE""? M-A-U-V-E → E absent.

""JAUPS""? Not common.

""BAVIN""? N absent.

""KAVAS""? S absent? S is absent.

""MAWKY""? Y absent.

""GAUZY""? Y and Z? G-A-U-Z-Y → A is second? G(1), A(2), U(3)? Not A at third.

We need to focus on words with A in the third.

""ABAFT""? A-B-A-F-T → A is first? A(1), B(2), A(3), F(4), T(5). T is absent.

""AGAMA""? A-G-A-M-A → A is first? A(1), G(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). So A at third. But we have multiple A's. Letters: A, G, M. G and M are available. But the word ""agama"" is a type of lizard, so valid.

But we are reusing A, but that's okay.

So we are testing A at positions 1,4,5? But we know position 3 is A, so we are testing if there are A's elsewhere.

But we are also testing G and M.

Another word: ""BABKA""? B-A-B-K-A → A is second? B(1), A(2), B(3), K(4), A(5). Not A at third.

""JABOT""? J-A-B-O-T → A is second? J(1), A(2), B(3), O(4), T(5). T absent.

""OAKUM""? O-A-K-U-M → A is second? O(1), A(2), K(3), U(4), M(5). Not third.

""GUAVA""? G-U-A-V-A → U(1), G(2)? Wait: G-U-A-V-A → positions: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:V, 5:A. So A at third and fifth. And letters: G, U, V, A. G, U, V are available.

""Guava"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""quaff"" as I thought earlier.

""Guava"" might be better because it has more common letters? But U and V are not the most common, but it's acceptable.

Another word: ""UMIAC""? Not common.

""VAGUS""? V-A-G-U-S → S absent.

""JUMAR""? J-U-M-A-R → R absent.

So, ""guava"" or ""quaff"".

But ""guava"" has two A's, which might be useful to test for duplicate A's.

We could also consider ""BAUDS""? But D and S absent.

""FAUGH""? F-A-U-G-H → H absent? H is absent from guess 3.

""GAUMS""? S absent.

""QUASS""? S absent.

""WAUGH""? W-A-U-G-H → H absent.

So, let's go with ""guava"".

But note: in ""guava"", the first letter is G, second U, third A (correct), fourth V, fifth A.

We are testing G, U, V, and A at positions 1,4,5.

Since we know A is at 3, if we get feedback for A at 1,4,5, it will tell us if there are additional A's.
