We are starting the game and need to make the first guess. Since there are no prior clues, we should choose a word that contains common letters and has a balanced letter distribution to maximize information.

Common starting words in Wordle often include letters like S, T, R, N, E, A, etc.

Let me think of a word that uses some of the most common letters in English 5-letter words.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common. Another is ""ROATE"" but that might be less common. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one.

But I notice that the feedback system uses ✓ for correct, - for present but wrong position, and x for absent.

Let me try ""STARE"". It has S, T, A, R, E which are all common.

Alternatively, ""ARISE"" is also good because it has A, R, I, S, E.

Which one to pick? Both are good. I'll go with ""ARISE"" because it has two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (R, S, E) and introduces common letters.

So my first guess: ARISE

But note: after this guess, I'll get feedback and then use that for the next guess. However, the problem is asking only for the first guess.

So I'll output: <guess>ARISE</guess>

However, let me make sure ""ARISE"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to emerge or become apparent.

So, response:
</think>
For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes the information gained about the secret word. Since there are no prior clues, I should select a word with common letters that frequently appear in 5-letter English words. Letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are ideal. 

I considered words such as ""CRANE"" (covering C, R, A, N, E) or ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but landed on ""ARISE"" because it:
- Uses 5 distinct letters to avoid duplication and test more characters.
- Includes four very common vowels/consonants: A, R, I, S, and E (E is the most common letter in English).
- Has a balanced structure (two vowels, three consonants) that often appears in English words.

This choice should provide strong initial feedback on letter presence and positions, helping to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels like A, E, I, O and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. We want a word with no repeating letters to test as many distinct letters as possible.

A popular starting word in similar games is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"", but I am considering ""ARISE"" because it:
- Uses 5 distinct letters: A, R, I, S, E.
- Contains both vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S).
- Includes the letter E, which is especially common in English words.

After guessing ""ARISE"", the feedback will tell us which of these letters are present (and their positions), helping to narrow down the possibilities for future guesses.

Thus, I choose ""ARISE"" as my first guess.

We have feedback from the first guess ""ARISE"": 
 A(x) - A is not in the secret word.
 R(x) - R is not in the secret word.
 I(x) - I is not in the secret word.
 S(-) - S is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 E(-) - E is in the secret word but in the wrong position.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters S and E, but not at the positions they were in ""ARISE"" (specifically, S was at position 3 and E at position 5, so they are elsewhere).
 - The secret word does NOT contain A, R, or I.

 We must avoid using the letters A, R, and I in our next guess.
 We must include S and E, but not in position 3 for S (since it was at position 3 and was wrong) and not in position 5 for E (since it was at position 5 and wrong).

 Also, since E is in the word but not at the end, and S is in the word but not at the third position, we can consider where they might go.

 Possible positions for S: positions 1, 2, 4 (but not 3, and not 5? wait, position 5 is also available since it was E that was at position 5, but S might be anywhere else). Similarly for E: positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, note that S was at index 3 (third letter) and E at index 4 (fifth letter? wait, let's index: A=1, R=2, I=3, S=4? Actually, no: in string ""ARISE"", positions:

 Position 1: A
 Position 2: R
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: S
 Position 5: E

 So, S was at position 4 and E at position 5? Actually, if it's a 5-letter word:

 Letter 1: A -> got x
 Letter 2: R -> got x
 Letter 3: I -> got x
 Letter 4: S -> got - (wrong position)
 Letter 5: E -> got - (wrong position)

 Therefore, S cannot be at position 4 and E cannot be at position 5.

 So S must be in position 1, 2, or 5? Actually, position 5 is available for S? It was E that was at position 5, not S. Similarly, E cannot be at position 5, so E must be in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 Also, we must avoid using A, R, I.

 Now, we want to form a new word that:
 1. Is a valid 5-letter English word.
 2. Contains S and E (since we know they are present).
 3. Does not contain A, R, or I.
 4. Places S NOT at position 4 (and E not at position 5).

 Moreover, we can introduce new letters to get more information.

 Common letters we can consider: we can use other vowels (O, U) or common consonants like T, N, D, L, etc.

 Let's think of words that include S and E, but without A, R, I, and with S not at position 4 and E not at position 5.

 Some possibilities:

 Since S can be at start, middle or end (but not position 4 in this word? Actually, in the new guess, we can put S anywhere as long as it's not position 4? But wait: the feedback only says S is not in position 4 in the secret word. In our next guess, we can put S in position 4 to test? Actually, that's allowed, but note: we know the secret word doesn't have S at position 4, so putting S at position 4 in a guess would be wasted because we know it won't be correct. But actually, we might do that to get feedback on other letters? However, it might be better to use positions that are still possible to get correct.

 Alternatively, we can try to place S and E in positions that are likely and introduce new consonants.

 Example words:

 Let's consider S at position 1: then we need E somewhere else (not at position 5). For example:
  S _ _ _ E -> but cannot put E at position 5? Wait, no: we know E is in the word but not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? Actually, we are allowed to guess a word with E at position 5, but the feedback would show that it's not in the correct position? However, we already know E isn't at position 5, so it would be better to put E in a new position to test.

 The rule: we must not put E at position 5? We can put it, but it will be wrong. So to maximize information, we avoid positions we know are wrong.

 Similarly, we know S is not at position 4.

 So in this guess:

 Option 1: Put S in position 1 and E in positions 2, 3, or 4? And avoid position 4 for S? Actually, in the new guess, we are free to put S at position 4? But we know the secret doesn't have S at position 4, so if we put it there, we'll get a '-' again? So we might avoid testing S at position 4 and put it somewhere else to see if that's the correct spot.

 Similarly, avoid E at position 5.

 Let's try to find words that have S and E, not using A, R, I, and placing S at a new position (say 1 or 2 or 5) and E not at 5.

 For example: word ""TIMES"" - but it has I and we know I is not in the word -> invalid because we know I is absent.

 How about ""STORE"": 
  S at position 1 -> good (not position 4)
  T, O, R, E? Wait, R is in ""STORE"" -> we know R is absent, so avoid R.

 How about ""SPELL""? 
  S at 1, P, E, L, L -> but note: L repeated? Also, we don't know if L is present or not. But R is avoided? 

 However, we must not use R? Since we know R is absent? Yes.

 ""SPELL"" has two L's? Actually, it has L twice? We don't know if the secret word has L or how many? But it's valid.

 But let me check: S1, P2, E3, L4, L5. 
 We want E not at position 5? It's at position 3 -> good. And S not at 4? Position 1 -> good.

 But note: we need E to be in the word? Yes, we have one E.

 However, the word ""spell"" has two L's? That might not be ideal? Also, we have repeated letter? 

 But let's think: we can use words with repeated letters? It's allowed? Actually, the rules don't forbid it. But we are trying to maximize information, so distinct letters might be better? 

 Alternatively, consider ""STONE"":
  S at 1, T, O, N, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is forbidden? Because we know E isn't at position 5. So not allowed? Actually, we can place E at 5, but we know it's wrong? And we'll get a '-' for E? But we are wasting a positional test? Because we already know E isn't at end.

 Better to try E at a new position to see if it's correct elsewhere.

 Alternatively, put E at position 2: words like ""SEVEN"", but note: V is possible? 

 ""SEVEN"": S1, E2, V3, E4? Wait, two E's? And E at position 2: is that okay? But at position 2, we don't know. And we have to avoid R? Yes.

 However, we already know E is present? So we can have two E's? But in ""SEVEN"" we have two E's? Actually the word ""SEVEN"" has letters S,E,V,E,N? So E twice? But that's okay? 

 But the feedback: if the secret word has only one E? Then one of the E's would be marked differently? Actually, the feedback counts occurrences?

 However, our goal is to get the secret word. So let's choose a word without repeated letters?

 ""SETUP"": has S, E, T, U, P? 
 Positions: S1, E2, T3, U4, P5? 
 Avoids A, R, I? Yes. 
 E is at position 2 -> new position? And S at 1? 

 However, U and P might be common? 

 Another word: ""SNOUT"" -> but no E? We must include E? Because we know E is in the word? Oh yes, must have E? 

 So ""SETUP"": 
  Includes S and E, 
  Avoids A, R, I.
  S is at position 1 (not 4) -> good.
  E is at position 2 (not 5) -> good.

 Alternatively, ""STEEP""? But repeated E? 

 Alternatively, ""SEDAN""? But we know A is absent? So cannot use A? 

 We need words without A, R, I.

 Another idea: ""SLEEP""? Repeated E? And we don't know L? 

 Alternatively, ""SENT_"": 
  ""SENTE""? Not common? 
  ""SENT"" words: ""SETUP"" is one? 

 How about ""SEEDS""? repeated E and S? 

 My goal: to cover more new letters? 

 Consider ""OUPHE""? Not starting with S? 

 Let's think systematically.

 We need a word that: 
 5 letters, 
 contains S and E (but S should be placed anywhere except position 4, and E anywhere except position 5? Actually, in our next guess, we can try E at positions 1,2,3,4 and S at positions 1,2,3,5? So possible placements.

 Example words:

 - ""TYPES"": 
   T1, Y2, P3, E4, S5 -> E at position 4? (not 5), S at position 5? (which is new). But avoid using R? No R, A, I? T, Y, P are new? Includes S and E. 
   Valid word? Type: not? ""TYPES"" is a word? Yes, meaning plural of a type or categories.

 - ""STYLE"": 
   S1, T2, Y3, L4, E5 -> but E at position 5? Not allowed? Because we know E isn't at 5? So we'll get a '-'? Also, we already know E is present? So we can avoid E at 5.

 Alternatively, ""STYED"": 
   S1, T2, Y3, E4, D5 -> E at position 4? Good? 
   But ""STYED"" is not common? 

 Another: ""DOES"": but 4 letters? 

 How about ""USHER"": but has U, S, H, E, R? We know R is absent? So avoid ""R"". 

 Since we know two letters present (S and E) and three absent (A, R, I), let's choose a word with S, E and three new letters? Preferably common consonants and vowels.

 Words without A, R, I, that have S and E:

 Example: ""QUEST"" -> Q, U, E, S, T? 
 Positions: Q1, U2, E3, S4, T5? 
 But S is placed at position 4? Which we know is incorrect? Because we know S is not at position 4? So we'll get '-' for S? Also, E at position 3? That's acceptable? 

 But then we are testing S at a known wrong position? We will get feedback that S is present (which we know) and at wrong position (which we know) and similarly we test Q, U, T? 

 Another word: ""BELOW"": but doesn't have S? 

 How about ""NEST"": but 4 letters? 

 How about ""SINGE"": but we know I is absent? 

 How about ""TEST"": 4 letters.

 Let's try to get E at position 1,2,3, or 4? And S not at 4? 

 Words: 
 ""STEAD"": A? absent? 
 ""STEMS"": S twice? 
 ""STOLE"": O, L? But E is not at position 5? E at 4? Also, L and O? 
 But wait: ""STOLE"": 
   S1, T2, O3, L4, E5 -> E at position 5? Avoid? 

 How about ""CHOSE"": 
   C1, H2, O3, S4, E5 -> but S at position 4? Avoid? 

 Then, how about ""COVES"": 
   C1, O2, V3, E4, S5? E at 4? S at 5? This avoids the wrong positions: 
   - We are putting S at position 5? Which we haven't tested? That's good? 
   - E at position 4? Which we haven't tested? 
   Also, no A, R, I? 
   Word: ""COVES"" meaning plural of cove? Valid? 

 However, let's list: 
 New letters: C, O, V, E (known) and S (known)? 

 Actually, we have E and S? So letters: C, O, V, E, S? 

 This seems good: 
  - Tests new letters C, O, V? 
  - Places E at position 4? Which was previously untested? 
  - Places S at position 5? Also untested? 

 We know E is present (any position but 5) and S present (any position but 4). 

 So ""COVES"" might be a good guess.

 Another option: ""DOVES"" -> same as above? 

 Or ""MOVES""?

 Since we want to introduce common letters? 

 But ""COVES"" has C which is not that common? 

 Alternatively, ""HOMES""? Has O? 

 How about ""SOLES""? 
   S1? Then positions: S1, O2, L3, E4, S5 -> repeated S? 
   But we know S is present? So repeated? The secret word might have two S? 

 But we don't know? So try to have distinct letters? 

 ""COVES"" avoids repetition? 

 Other words: ""SENSE"": has two S? 

 After considering, I think ""TILES"" is not? I is absent.

 Another word: ""MODES"": 
   M1, O2, D3, E4, S5 -> valid? And E at 4, S at 5? 
   We avoid A,R,I? 
   Letters: M,O,D,E,S? 
   E and S present? So tests M, O, D? 

 Is ""MODES"" a word? Yes.

 Similarly, ""CODES"": 
   C1, O2, D3, E4, S5? 

 Both are comparable? 

 How about ""BONES""? 
   B1, O2, N3, E4, S5? 

 Also valid? 

 Among these, let's pick one? 

 We also have to consider: are any of these words common? Yes.

 Now, feedback importance: We want to test if E is at position 4? And S at position 5? And simultaneously introduce new letters? That's fine.

 Alternatively, put S in the beginning? 

 But I think ""MODES"" is a good choice? 

 Let me select ""MODES"" because it uses M, O, D which are common.

 Another candidate: ""DUVETS""? Too long? 

 Or ""POPES""? Repeated P? 

 So, I'll go with ""MODES"".

 Alternatively, ""SICK"": not 5 letters? 

 Final decision: Guess ""MODES""

 But let me confirm: 
 Without A, R, I?: M,O,D,E,S -> no A,R,I? Correct.
 Contains E and S? Yes.
 Positions: M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), S(5) 
 We are testing E at position 4? Not done before? 
 We are testing S at position 5? Not tested before? 

 This is acceptable.

 Let's output: 
</think>
Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""ARISE""), we know:
- A, R, and I are **not** in the secret word.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include **S** and **E** (since they are present).
- Must **avoid** A, R, I.
- S cannot be placed in position 4 (based on previous feedback).
- E cannot be placed in position 5 (based on previous feedback).
- Goal: Test new positions for S and E while introducing common unused consonants (M, O, D) to maximize information.

The word ""MODES"" fits perfectly:
- Positions: M (1), O (2), D (3), E (4), S (5).
- E is at position 4 (previously untested position).
- S is at position 5 (previously untested position).
- Uses new letters M, O, D to probe for additional presence/absence.

<guess>MODES</guess>",MODES,"We have feedback from the first guess ""ARISE"": 
 A(x) - A is not in the secret word.
 R(x) - R is not in the secret word.
 I(x) - I is not in the secret word.
 S(-) - S is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 E(-) - E is in the secret word but in the wrong position.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters S and E, but not at the positions they were in ""ARISE"" (specifically, S was at position 3 and E at position 5, so they are elsewhere).
 - The secret word does NOT contain A, R, or I.

 We must avoid using the letters A, R, and I in our next guess.
 We must include S and E, but not in position 3 for S (since it was at position 3 and was wrong) and not in position 5 for E (since it was at position 5 and wrong).

 Also, since E is in the word but not at the end, and S is in the word but not at the third position, we can consider where they might go.

 Possible positions for S: positions 1, 2, 4 (but not 3, and not 5? wait, position 5 is also available since it was E that was at position 5, but S might be anywhere else). Similarly for E: positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, note that S was at index 3 (third letter) and E at index 4 (fifth letter? wait, let's index: A=1, R=2, I=3, S=4? Actually, no: in string ""ARISE"", positions:

 Position 1: A
 Position 2: R
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: S
 Position 5: E

 So, S was at position 4 and E at position 5? Actually, if it's a 5-letter word:

 Letter 1: A -> got x
 Letter 2: R -> got x
 Letter 3: I -> got x
 Letter 4: S -> got - (wrong position)
 Letter 5: E -> got - (wrong position)

 Therefore, S cannot be at position 4 and E cannot be at position 5.

 So S must be in position 1, 2, or 5? Actually, position 5 is available for S? It was E that was at position 5, not S. Similarly, E cannot be at position 5, so E must be in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 Also, we must avoid using A, R, I.

 Now, we want to form a new word that:
 1. Is a valid 5-letter English word.
 2. Contains S and E (since we know they are present).
 3. Does not contain A, R, or I.
 4. Places S NOT at position 4 (and E not at position 5).

 Moreover, we can introduce new letters to get more information.

 Common letters we can consider: we can use other vowels (O, U) or common consonants like T, N, D, L, etc.

 Let's think of words that include S and E, but without A, R, I, and with S not at position 4 and E not at position 5.

 Some possibilities:

 Since S can be at start, middle or end (but not position 4 in this word? Actually, in the new guess, we can put S anywhere as long as it's not position 4? But wait: the feedback only says S is not in position 4 in the secret word. In our next guess, we can put S in position 4 to test? Actually, that's allowed, but note: we know the secret word doesn't have S at position 4, so putting S at position 4 in a guess would be wasted because we know it won't be correct. But actually, we might do that to get feedback on other letters? However, it might be better to use positions that are still possible to get correct.

 Alternatively, we can try to place S and E in positions that are likely and introduce new consonants.

 Example words:

 Let's consider S at position 1: then we need E somewhere else (not at position 5). For example:
  S _ _ _ E -> but cannot put E at position 5? Wait, no: we know E is in the word but not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? Actually, we are allowed to guess a word with E at position 5, but the feedback would show that it's not in the correct position? However, we already know E isn't at position 5, so it would be better to put E in a new position to test.

 The rule: we must not put E at position 5? We can put it, but it will be wrong. So to maximize information, we avoid positions we know are wrong.

 Similarly, we know S is not at position 4.

 So in this guess:

 Option 1: Put S in position 1 and E in positions 2, 3, or 4? And avoid position 4 for S? Actually, in the new guess, we are free to put S at position 4? But we know the secret doesn't have S at position 4, so if we put it there, we'll get a '-' again? So we might avoid testing S at position 4 and put it somewhere else to see if that's the correct spot.

 Similarly, avoid E at position 5.

 Let's try to find words that have S and E, not using A, R, I, and placing S at a new position (say 1 or 2 or 5) and E not at 5.

 For example: word ""TIMES"" - but it has I and we know I is not in the word -> invalid because we know I is absent.

 How about ""STORE"": 
  S at position 1 -> good (not position 4)
  T, O, R, E? Wait, R is in ""STORE"" -> we know R is absent, so avoid R.

 How about ""SPELL""? 
  S at 1, P, E, L, L -> but note: L repeated? Also, we don't know if L is present or not. But R is avoided? 

 However, we must not use R? Since we know R is absent? Yes.

 ""SPELL"" has two L's? Actually, it has L twice? We don't know if the secret word has L or how many? But it's valid.

 But let me check: S1, P2, E3, L4, L5. 
 We want E not at position 5? It's at position 3 -> good. And S not at 4? Position 1 -> good.

 But note: we need E to be in the word? Yes, we have one E.

 However, the word ""spell"" has two L's? That might not be ideal? Also, we have repeated letter? 

 But let's think: we can use words with repeated letters? It's allowed? Actually, the rules don't forbid it. But we are trying to maximize information, so distinct letters might be better? 

 Alternatively, consider ""STONE"":
  S at 1, T, O, N, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is forbidden? Because we know E isn't at position 5. So not allowed? Actually, we can place E at 5, but we know it's wrong? And we'll get a '-' for E? But we are wasting a positional test? Because we already know E isn't at end.

 Better to try E at a new position to see if it's correct elsewhere.

 Alternatively, put E at position 2: words like ""SEVEN"", but note: V is possible? 

 ""SEVEN"": S1, E2, V3, E4? Wait, two E's? And E at position 2: is that okay? But at position 2, we don't know. And we have to avoid R? Yes.

 However, we already know E is present? So we can have two E's? But in ""SEVEN"" we have two E's? Actually the word ""SEVEN"" has letters S,E,V,E,N? So E twice? But that's okay? 

 But the feedback: if the secret word has only one E? Then one of the E's would be marked differently? Actually, the feedback counts occurrences?

 However, our goal is to get the secret word. So let's choose a word without repeated letters?

 ""SETUP"": has S, E, T, U, P? 
 Positions: S1, E2, T3, U4, P5? 
 Avoids A, R, I? Yes. 
 E is at position 2 -> new position? And S at 1? 

 However, U and P might be common? 

 Another word: ""SNOUT"" -> but no E? We must include E? Because we know E is in the word? Oh yes, must have E? 

 So ""SETUP"": 
  Includes S and E, 
  Avoids A, R, I.
  S is at position 1 (not 4) -> good.
  E is at position 2 (not 5) -> good.

 Alternatively, ""STEEP""? But repeated E? 

 Alternatively, ""SEDAN""? But we know A is absent? So cannot use A? 

 We need words without A, R, I.

 Another idea: ""SLEEP""? Repeated E? And we don't know L? 

 Alternatively, ""SENT_"": 
  ""SENTE""? Not common? 
  ""SENT"" words: ""SETUP"" is one? 

 How about ""SEEDS""? repeated E and S? 

 My goal: to cover more new letters? 

 Consider ""OUPHE""? Not starting with S? 

 Let's think systematically.

 We need a word that: 
 5 letters, 
 contains S and E (but S should be placed anywhere except position 4, and E anywhere except position 5? Actually, in our next guess, we can try E at positions 1,2,3,4 and S at positions 1,2,3,5? So possible placements.

 Example words:

 - ""TYPES"": 
   T1, Y2, P3, E4, S5 -> E at position 4? (not 5), S at position 5? (which is new). But avoid using R? No R, A, I? T, Y, P are new? Includes S and E. 
   Valid word? Type: not? ""TYPES"" is a word? Yes, meaning plural of a type or categories.

 - ""STYLE"": 
   S1, T2, Y3, L4, E5 -> but E at position 5? Not allowed? Because we know E isn't at 5? So we'll get a '-'? Also, we already know E is present? So we can avoid E at 5.

 Alternatively, ""STYED"": 
   S1, T2, Y3, E4, D5 -> E at position 4? Good? 
   But ""STYED"" is not common? 

 Another: ""DOES"": but 4 letters? 

 How about ""USHER"": but has U, S, H, E, R? We know R is absent? So avoid ""R"". 

 Since we know two letters present (S and E) and three absent (A, R, I), let's choose a word with S, E and three new letters? Preferably common consonants and vowels.

 Words without A, R, I, that have S and E:

 Example: ""QUEST"" -> Q, U, E, S, T? 
 Positions: Q1, U2, E3, S4, T5? 
 But S is placed at position 4? Which we know is incorrect? Because we know S is not at position 4? So we'll get '-' for S? Also, E at position 3? That's acceptable? 

 But then we are testing S at a known wrong position? We will get feedback that S is present (which we know) and at wrong position (which we know) and similarly we test Q, U, T? 

 Another word: ""BELOW"": but doesn't have S? 

 How about ""NEST"": but 4 letters? 

 How about ""SINGE"": but we know I is absent? 

 How about ""TEST"": 4 letters.

 Let's try to get E at position 1,2,3, or 4? And S not at 4? 

 Words: 
 ""STEAD"": A? absent? 
 ""STEMS"": S twice? 
 ""STOLE"": O, L? But E is not at position 5? E at 4? Also, L and O? 
 But wait: ""STOLE"": 
   S1, T2, O3, L4, E5 -> E at position 5? Avoid? 

 How about ""CHOSE"": 
   C1, H2, O3, S4, E5 -> but S at position 4? Avoid? 

 Then, how about ""COVES"": 
   C1, O2, V3, E4, S5? E at 4? S at 5? This avoids the wrong positions: 
   - We are putting S at position 5? Which we haven't tested? That's good? 
   - E at position 4? Which we haven't tested? 
   Also, no A, R, I? 
   Word: ""COVES"" meaning plural of cove? Valid? 

 However, let's list: 
 New letters: C, O, V, E (known) and S (known)? 

 Actually, we have E and S? So letters: C, O, V, E, S? 

 This seems good: 
  - Tests new letters C, O, V? 
  - Places E at position 4? Which was previously untested? 
  - Places S at position 5? Also untested? 

 We know E is present (any position but 5) and S present (any position but 4). 

 So ""COVES"" might be a good guess.

 Another option: ""DOVES"" -> same as above? 

 Or ""MOVES""?

 Since we want to introduce common letters? 

 But ""COVES"" has C which is not that common? 

 Alternatively, ""HOMES""? Has O? 

 How about ""SOLES""? 
   S1? Then positions: S1, O2, L3, E4, S5 -> repeated S? 
   But we know S is present? So repeated? The secret word might have two S? 

 But we don't know? So try to have distinct letters? 

 ""COVES"" avoids repetition? 

 Other words: ""SENSE"": has two S? 

 After considering, I think ""TILES"" is not? I is absent.

 Another word: ""MODES"": 
   M1, O2, D3, E4, S5 -> valid? And E at 4, S at 5? 
   We avoid A,R,I? 
   Letters: M,O,D,E,S? 
   E and S present? So tests M, O, D? 

 Is ""MODES"" a word? Yes.

 Similarly, ""CODES"": 
   C1, O2, D3, E4, S5? 

 Both are comparable? 

 How about ""BONES""? 
   B1, O2, N3, E4, S5? 

 Also valid? 

 Among these, let's pick one? 

 We also have to consider: are any of these words common? Yes.

 Now, feedback importance: We want to test if E is at position 4? And S at position 5? And simultaneously introduce new letters? That's fine.

 Alternatively, put S in the beginning? 

 But I think ""MODES"" is a good choice? 

 Let me select ""MODES"" because it uses M, O, D which are common.

 Another candidate: ""DUVETS""? Too long? 

 Or ""POPES""? Repeated P? 

 So, I'll go with ""MODES"".

 Alternatively, ""SICK"": not 5 letters? 

 Final decision: Guess ""MODES""

 But let me confirm: 
 Without A, R, I?: M,O,D,E,S -> no A,R,I? Correct.
 Contains E and S? Yes.
 Positions: M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), S(5) 
 We are testing E at position 4? Not done before? 
 We are testing S at position 5? Not tested before? 

 This is acceptable.

 Let's output:Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""ARISE""), we know:
- A, R, and I are **not** in the secret word.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include **S** and **E** (since they are present).
- Must **avoid** A, R, I.
- S cannot be placed in position 4 (based on previous feedback).
- E cannot be placed in position 5 (based on previous feedback).
- Goal: Test new positions for S and E while introducing common unused consonants (M, O, D) to maximize information.

The word ""MODES"" fits perfectly:
- Positions: M (1), O (2), D (3), E (4), S (5).
- E is at position 4 (previously untested position).
- S is at position 5 (previously untested position).
- Uses new letters M, O, D to probe for additional presence/absence.",Guess 2: MODES -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(x) D(x) E(-) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,smelt,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game and need to make the first guess. Since there are no prior clues, we should choose a word that contains common letters and has a balanced letter distribution to maximize information.

Common starting words in Wordle often include letters like S, T, R, N, E, A, etc.

Let me think of a word that uses some of the most common letters in English 5-letter words.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common. Another is ""ROATE"" but that might be less common. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one.

But I notice that the feedback system uses ✓ for correct, - for present but wrong position, and x for absent.

Let me try ""STARE"". It has S, T, A, R, E which are all common.

Alternatively, ""ARISE"" is also good because it has A, R, I, S, E.

Which one to pick? Both are good. I'll go with ""ARISE"" because it has two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (R, S, E) and introduces common letters.

So my first guess: ARISE

But note: after this guess, I'll get feedback and then use that for the next guess. However, the problem is asking only for the first guess.

So I'll output: <guess>ARISE</guess>

However, let me make sure ""ARISE"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to emerge or become apparent.

So, response:For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes the information gained about the secret word. Since there are no prior clues, I should select a word with common letters that frequently appear in 5-letter English words. Letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are ideal. 

I considered words such as ""CRANE"" (covering C, R, A, N, E) or ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but landed on ""ARISE"" because it:
- Uses 5 distinct letters to avoid duplication and test more characters.
- Includes four very common vowels/consonants: A, R, I, S, and E (E is the most common letter in English).
- Has a balanced structure (two vowels, three consonants) that often appears in English words.

This choice should provide strong initial feedback on letter presence and positions, helping to narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>ARISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""ARISE"": 
 A(x) - A is not in the secret word.
 R(x) - R is not in the secret word.
 I(x) - I is not in the secret word.
 S(-) - S is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 E(-) - E is in the secret word but in the wrong position.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters S and E, but not at the positions they were in ""ARISE"" (specifically, S was at position 3 and E at position 5, so they are elsewhere).
 - The secret word does NOT contain A, R, or I.

 We must avoid using the letters A, R, and I in our next guess.
 We must include S and E, but not in position 3 for S (since it was at position 3 and was wrong) and not in position 5 for E (since it was at position 5 and wrong).

 Also, since E is in the word but not at the end, and S is in the word but not at the third position, we can consider where they might go.

 Possible positions for S: positions 1, 2, 4 (but not 3, and not 5? wait, position 5 is also available since it was E that was at position 5, but S might be anywhere else). Similarly for E: positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, note that S was at index 3 (third letter) and E at index 4 (fifth letter? wait, let's index: A=1, R=2, I=3, S=4? Actually, no: in string ""ARISE"", positions:

 Position 1: A
 Position 2: R
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: S
 Position 5: E

 So, S was at position 4 and E at position 5? Actually, if it's a 5-letter word:

 Letter 1: A -> got x
 Letter 2: R -> got x
 Letter 3: I -> got x
 Letter 4: S -> got - (wrong position)
 Letter 5: E -> got - (wrong position)

 Therefore, S cannot be at position 4 and E cannot be at position 5.

 So S must be in position 1, 2, or 5? Actually, position 5 is available for S? It was E that was at position 5, not S. Similarly, E cannot be at position 5, so E must be in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 Also, we must avoid using A, R, I.

 Now, we want to form a new word that:
 1. Is a valid 5-letter English word.
 2. Contains S and E (since we know they are present).
 3. Does not contain A, R, or I.
 4. Places S NOT at position 4 (and E not at position 5).

 Moreover, we can introduce new letters to get more information.

 Common letters we can consider: we can use other vowels (O, U) or common consonants like T, N, D, L, etc.

 Let's think of words that include S and E, but without A, R, I, and with S not at position 4 and E not at position 5.

 Some possibilities:

 Since S can be at start, middle or end (but not position 4 in this word? Actually, in the new guess, we can put S anywhere as long as it's not position 4? But wait: the feedback only says S is not in position 4 in the secret word. In our next guess, we can put S in position 4 to test? Actually, that's allowed, but note: we know the secret word doesn't have S at position 4, so putting S at position 4 in a guess would be wasted because we know it won't be correct. But actually, we might do that to get feedback on other letters? However, it might be better to use positions that are still possible to get correct.

 Alternatively, we can try to place S and E in positions that are likely and introduce new consonants.

 Example words:

 Let's consider S at position 1: then we need E somewhere else (not at position 5). For example:
  S _ _ _ E -> but cannot put E at position 5? Wait, no: we know E is in the word but not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? Actually, we are allowed to guess a word with E at position 5, but the feedback would show that it's not in the correct position? However, we already know E isn't at position 5, so it would be better to put E in a new position to test.

 The rule: we must not put E at position 5? We can put it, but it will be wrong. So to maximize information, we avoid positions we know are wrong.

 Similarly, we know S is not at position 4.

 So in this guess:

 Option 1: Put S in position 1 and E in positions 2, 3, or 4? And avoid position 4 for S? Actually, in the new guess, we are free to put S at position 4? But we know the secret doesn't have S at position 4, so if we put it there, we'll get a '-' again? So we might avoid testing S at position 4 and put it somewhere else to see if that's the correct spot.

 Similarly, avoid E at position 5.

 Let's try to find words that have S and E, not using A, R, I, and placing S at a new position (say 1 or 2 or 5) and E not at 5.

 For example: word ""TIMES"" - but it has I and we know I is not in the word -> invalid because we know I is absent.

 How about ""STORE"": 
  S at position 1 -> good (not position 4)
  T, O, R, E? Wait, R is in ""STORE"" -> we know R is absent, so avoid R.

 How about ""SPELL""? 
  S at 1, P, E, L, L -> but note: L repeated? Also, we don't know if L is present or not. But R is avoided? 

 However, we must not use R? Since we know R is absent? Yes.

 ""SPELL"" has two L's? Actually, it has L twice? We don't know if the secret word has L or how many? But it's valid.

 But let me check: S1, P2, E3, L4, L5. 
 We want E not at position 5? It's at position 3 -> good. And S not at 4? Position 1 -> good.

 But note: we need E to be in the word? Yes, we have one E.

 However, the word ""spell"" has two L's? That might not be ideal? Also, we have repeated letter? 

 But let's think: we can use words with repeated letters? It's allowed? Actually, the rules don't forbid it. But we are trying to maximize information, so distinct letters might be better? 

 Alternatively, consider ""STONE"":
  S at 1, T, O, N, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is forbidden? Because we know E isn't at position 5. So not allowed? Actually, we can place E at 5, but we know it's wrong? And we'll get a '-' for E? But we are wasting a positional test? Because we already know E isn't at end.

 Better to try E at a new position to see if it's correct elsewhere.

 Alternatively, put E at position 2: words like ""SEVEN"", but note: V is possible? 

 ""SEVEN"": S1, E2, V3, E4? Wait, two E's? And E at position 2: is that okay? But at position 2, we don't know. And we have to avoid R? Yes.

 However, we already know E is present? So we can have two E's? But in ""SEVEN"" we have two E's? Actually the word ""SEVEN"" has letters S,E,V,E,N? So E twice? But that's okay? 

 But the feedback: if the secret word has only one E? Then one of the E's would be marked differently? Actually, the feedback counts occurrences?

 However, our goal is to get the secret word. So let's choose a word without repeated letters?

 ""SETUP"": has S, E, T, U, P? 
 Positions: S1, E2, T3, U4, P5? 
 Avoids A, R, I? Yes. 
 E is at position 2 -> new position? And S at 1? 

 However, U and P might be common? 

 Another word: ""SNOUT"" -> but no E? We must include E? Because we know E is in the word? Oh yes, must have E? 

 So ""SETUP"": 
  Includes S and E, 
  Avoids A, R, I.
  S is at position 1 (not 4) -> good.
  E is at position 2 (not 5) -> good.

 Alternatively, ""STEEP""? But repeated E? 

 Alternatively, ""SEDAN""? But we know A is absent? So cannot use A? 

 We need words without A, R, I.

 Another idea: ""SLEEP""? Repeated E? And we don't know L? 

 Alternatively, ""SENT_"": 
  ""SENTE""? Not common? 
  ""SENT"" words: ""SETUP"" is one? 

 How about ""SEEDS""? repeated E and S? 

 My goal: to cover more new letters? 

 Consider ""OUPHE""? Not starting with S? 

 Let's think systematically.

 We need a word that: 
 5 letters, 
 contains S and E (but S should be placed anywhere except position 4, and E anywhere except position 5? Actually, in our next guess, we can try E at positions 1,2,3,4 and S at positions 1,2,3,5? So possible placements.

 Example words:

 - ""TYPES"": 
   T1, Y2, P3, E4, S5 -> E at position 4? (not 5), S at position 5? (which is new). But avoid using R? No R, A, I? T, Y, P are new? Includes S and E. 
   Valid word? Type: not? ""TYPES"" is a word? Yes, meaning plural of a type or categories.

 - ""STYLE"": 
   S1, T2, Y3, L4, E5 -> but E at position 5? Not allowed? Because we know E isn't at 5? So we'll get a '-'? Also, we already know E is present? So we can avoid E at 5.

 Alternatively, ""STYED"": 
   S1, T2, Y3, E4, D5 -> E at position 4? Good? 
   But ""STYED"" is not common? 

 Another: ""DOES"": but 4 letters? 

 How about ""USHER"": but has U, S, H, E, R? We know R is absent? So avoid ""R"". 

 Since we know two letters present (S and E) and three absent (A, R, I), let's choose a word with S, E and three new letters? Preferably common consonants and vowels.

 Words without A, R, I, that have S and E:

 Example: ""QUEST"" -> Q, U, E, S, T? 
 Positions: Q1, U2, E3, S4, T5? 
 But S is placed at position 4? Which we know is incorrect? Because we know S is not at position 4? So we'll get '-' for S? Also, E at position 3? That's acceptable? 

 But then we are testing S at a known wrong position? We will get feedback that S is present (which we know) and at wrong position (which we know) and similarly we test Q, U, T? 

 Another word: ""BELOW"": but doesn't have S? 

 How about ""NEST"": but 4 letters? 

 How about ""SINGE"": but we know I is absent? 

 How about ""TEST"": 4 letters.

 Let's try to get E at position 1,2,3, or 4? And S not at 4? 

 Words: 
 ""STEAD"": A? absent? 
 ""STEMS"": S twice? 
 ""STOLE"": O, L? But E is not at position 5? E at 4? Also, L and O? 
 But wait: ""STOLE"": 
   S1, T2, O3, L4, E5 -> E at position 5? Avoid? 

 How about ""CHOSE"": 
   C1, H2, O3, S4, E5 -> but S at position 4? Avoid? 

 Then, how about ""COVES"": 
   C1, O2, V3, E4, S5? E at 4? S at 5? This avoids the wrong positions: 
   - We are putting S at position 5? Which we haven't tested? That's good? 
   - E at position 4? Which we haven't tested? 
   Also, no A, R, I? 
   Word: ""COVES"" meaning plural of cove? Valid? 

 However, let's list: 
 New letters: C, O, V, E (known) and S (known)? 

 Actually, we have E and S? So letters: C, O, V, E, S? 

 This seems good: 
  - Tests new letters C, O, V? 
  - Places E at position 4? Which was previously untested? 
  - Places S at position 5? Also untested? 

 We know E is present (any position but 5) and S present (any position but 4). 

 So ""COVES"" might be a good guess.

 Another option: ""DOVES"" -> same as above? 

 Or ""MOVES""?

 Since we want to introduce common letters? 

 But ""COVES"" has C which is not that common? 

 Alternatively, ""HOMES""? Has O? 

 How about ""SOLES""? 
   S1? Then positions: S1, O2, L3, E4, S5 -> repeated S? 
   But we know S is present? So repeated? The secret word might have two S? 

 But we don't know? So try to have distinct letters? 

 ""COVES"" avoids repetition? 

 Other words: ""SENSE"": has two S? 

 After considering, I think ""TILES"" is not? I is absent.

 Another word: ""MODES"": 
   M1, O2, D3, E4, S5 -> valid? And E at 4, S at 5? 
   We avoid A,R,I? 
   Letters: M,O,D,E,S? 
   E and S present? So tests M, O, D? 

 Is ""MODES"" a word? Yes.

 Similarly, ""CODES"": 
   C1, O2, D3, E4, S5? 

 Both are comparable? 

 How about ""BONES""? 
   B1, O2, N3, E4, S5? 

 Also valid? 

 Among these, let's pick one? 

 We also have to consider: are any of these words common? Yes.

 Now, feedback importance: We want to test if E is at position 4? And S at position 5? And simultaneously introduce new letters? That's fine.

 Alternatively, put S in the beginning? 

 But I think ""MODES"" is a good choice? 

 Let me select ""MODES"" because it uses M, O, D which are common.

 Another candidate: ""DUVETS""? Too long? 

 Or ""POPES""? Repeated P? 

 So, I'll go with ""MODES"".

 Alternatively, ""SICK"": not 5 letters? 

 Final decision: Guess ""MODES""

 But let me confirm: 
 Without A, R, I?: M,O,D,E,S -> no A,R,I? Correct.
 Contains E and S? Yes.
 Positions: M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), S(5) 
 We are testing E at position 4? Not done before? 
 We are testing S at position 5? Not tested before? 

 This is acceptable.

 Let's output:Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""ARISE""), we know:
- A, R, and I are **not** in the secret word.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include **S** and **E** (since they are present).
- Must **avoid** A, R, I.
- S cannot be placed in position 4 (based on previous feedback).
- E cannot be placed in position 5 (based on previous feedback).
- Goal: Test new positions for S and E while introducing common unused consonants (M, O, D) to maximize information.

The word ""MODES"" fits perfectly:
- Positions: M (1), O (2), D (3), E (4), S (5).
- E is at position 4 (previously untested position).
- S is at position 5 (previously untested position).
- Uses new letters M, O, D to probe for additional presence/absence.

Actually, position 5 is available for S? It was E that was at position 5, not S. Similarly, E cannot be at position 5, so E must be in positions 1,2,3, or 4.\n\n Also, we must avoid using A, R, I.\n\n Now, we want to form a new word that:\n 1. Is a valid 5-letter English word.\n 2. Contains S and E (since we know they are present).\n 3. Does not contain A, R, or I.\n 4. Places S NOT at position 4 (and E not at position 5).\n\n Moreover, we can introduce new letters to get more information.\n\n Common letters we can consider: we can use other vowels (O, U) or common consonants like T, N, D, L, etc.\n\n Let\'s think of words that include S and E, but without A, R, I, and with S not at position 4 and E not at position 5.\n\n Some possibilities:\n\n Since S can be at start, middle or end (but not position 4 in this word? Actually, in the new guess, we can put S anywhere as long as it\'s not position 4? But wait: the feedback only says S is not in position 4 in the secret word. In our next guess, we can put S in position 4 to test? Actually, that\'s allowed, but note: we know the secret word doesn\'t have S at position 4, so putting S at position 4 in a guess would be wasted because we know it won\'t be correct. But actually, we might do that to get feedback on other letters? However, it might be better to use positions that are still possible to get correct.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to place S and E in positions that are likely and introduce new consonants.\n\n Example words:\n\n Let\'s consider S at position 1: then we need E somewhere else (not at position 5). For example:\n  S _ _ _ E -> but cannot put E at position 5? Wait, no: we know E is in the word but not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? Actually, we are allowed to guess a word with E at position 5, but the feedback would show that it\'s not in the correct position? However, we already know E isn\'t at position 5, so it would be better to put E in a new position to test.\n\n The rule: we must not put E at position 5? We can put it, but it will be wrong. So to maximize information, we avoid positions we know are wrong.\n\n Similarly, we know S is not at position 4.\n\n So in this guess:\n\n Option 1: Put S in position 1 and E in positions 2, 3, or 4? And avoid position 4 for S? Actually, in the new guess, we are free to put S at position 4? But we know the secret doesn\'t have S at position 4, so if we put it there, we\'ll get a \'-\' again? So we might avoid testing S at position 4 and put it somewhere else to see if that\'s the correct spot.\n\n Similarly, avoid E at position 5.\n\n Let\'s try to find words that have S and E, not using A, R, I, and placing S at a new position (say 1 or 2 or 5) and E not at 5.\n\n For example: word ""TIMES"" - but it has I and we know I is not in the word -> invalid because we know I is absent.\n\n How about ""STORE"": \n  S at position 1 -> good (not position 4)\n  T, O, R, E? Wait, R is in ""STORE"" -> we know R is absent, so avoid R.\n\n How about ""SPELL""? \n  S at 1, P, E, L, L -> but note: L repeated? Also, we don\'t know if L is present or not. But R is avoided? \n\n However, we must not use R? Since we know R is absent? Yes.\n\n ""SPELL"" has two L\'s? Actually, it has L twice? We don\'t know if the secret word has L or how many? But it\'s valid.\n\n But let me check: S1, P2, E3, L4, L5. \n We want E not at position 5? It\'s at position 3 -> good. And S not at 4? Position 1 -> good.\n\n But note: we need E to be in the word? Yes, we have one E.\n\n However, the word ""spell"" has two L\'s? That might not be ideal? Also, we have repeated letter? \n\n But let\'s think: we can use words with repeated letters? It\'s allowed? Actually, the rules don\'t forbid it. But we are trying to maximize information, so distinct letters might be better? \n\n Alternatively, consider ""STONE"":\n  S at 1, T, O, N, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is forbidden? Because we know E isn\'t at position 5. So not allowed? Actually, we can place E at 5, but we know it\'s wrong? And we\'ll get a \'-\' for E? But we are wasting a positional test? Because we already know E isn\'t at end.\n\n Better to try E at a new position to see if it\'s correct elsewhere.\n\n Alternatively, put E at position 2: words like ""SEVEN"", but note: V is possible? \n\n ""SEVEN"": S1, E2, V3, E4? Wait, two E\'s? And E at position 2: is that okay? But at position 2, we don\'t know. And we have to avoid R? Yes.\n\n However, we already know E is present? So we can have two E\'s? But in ""SEVEN"" we have two E\'s? Actually the word ""SEVEN"" has letters S,E,V,E,N? So E twice? But that\'s okay? \n\n But the feedback: if the secret word has only one E? Then one of the E\'s would be marked differently? Actually, the feedback counts occurrences?\n\n However, our goal is to get the secret word. So let\'s choose a word without repeated letters?\n\n ""SETUP"": has S, E, T, U, P? \n Positions: S1, E2, T3, U4, P5? \n Avoids A, R, I? Yes. \n E is at position 2 -> new position? And S at 1? \n\n However, U and P might be common? \n\n Another word: ""SNOUT"" -> but no E? We must include E? Because we know E is in the word? Oh yes, must have E? \n\n So ""SETUP"": \n  Includes S and E, \n  Avoids A, R, I.\n  S is at position 1 (not 4) -> good.\n  E is at position 2 (not 5) -> good.\n\n Alternatively, ""STEEP""? But repeated E? \n\n Alternatively, ""SEDAN""? But we know A is absent? So cannot use A? \n\n We need words without A, R, I.\n\n Another idea: ""SLEEP""? Repeated E? And we don\'t know L? \n\n Alternatively, ""SENT_"": \n  ""SENTE""? Not common? \n  ""SENT"" words: ""SETUP"" is one? \n\n How about ""SEEDS""? repeated E and S? \n\n My goal: to cover more new letters? \n\n Consider ""OUPHE""? Not starting with S? \n\n Let\'s think systematically.\n\n We need a word that: \n 5 letters, \n contains S and E (but S should be placed anywhere except position 4, and E anywhere except position 5? Actually, in our next guess, we can try E at positions 1,2,3,4 and S at positions 1,2,3,5? So possible placements.\n\n Example words:\n\n - ""TYPES"": \n   T1, Y2, P3, E4, S5 -> E at position 4? (not 5), S at position 5? (which is new). But avoid using R? No R, A, I? T, Y, P are new? Includes S and E. \n   Valid word? Type: not? ""TYPES"" is a word? Yes, meaning plural of a type or categories.\n\n - ""STYLE"": \n   S1, T2, Y3, L4, E5 -> but E at position 5? Not allowed? Because we know E isn\'t at 5? So we\'ll get a \'-\'? Also, we already know E is present? So we can avoid E at 5.\n\n Alternatively, ""STYED"": \n   S1, T2, Y3, E4, D5 -> E at position 4? Good? \n   But ""STYED"" is not common? \n\n Another: ""DOES"": but 4 letters? \n\n How about ""USHER"": but has U, S, H, E, R? We know R is absent? So avoid ""R"". \n\n Since we know two letters present (S and E) and three absent (A, R, I), let\'s choose a word with S, E and three new letters? Preferably common consonants and vowels.\n\n Words without A, R, I, that have S and E:\n\n Example: ""QUEST"" -> Q, U, E, S, T? \n Positions: Q1, U2, E3, S4, T5? \n But S is placed at position 4? Which we know is incorrect? Because we know S is not at position 4? So we\'ll get \'-\' for S? Also, E at position 3? That\'s acceptable? \n\n But then we are testing S at a known wrong position? We will get feedback that S is present (which we know) and at wrong position (which we know) and similarly we test Q, U, T? \n\n Another word: ""BELOW"": but doesn\'t have S? \n\n How about ""NEST"": but 4 letters? \n\n How about ""SINGE"": but we know I is absent? \n\n How about ""TEST"": 4 letters.\n\n Let\'s try to get E at position 1,2,3, or 4? And S not at 4? \n\n Words: \n ""STEAD"": A? absent? \n ""STEMS"": S twice? \n ""STOLE"": O, L? But E is not at position 5? E at 4? Also, L and O? \n But wait: ""STOLE"": \n   S1, T2, O3, L4, E5 -> E at position 5? Avoid? \n\n How about ""CHOSE"": \n   C1, H2, O3, S4, E5 -> but S at position 4? Avoid? \n\n Then, how about ""COVES"": \n   C1, O2, V3, E4, S5? E at 4? S at 5? This avoids the wrong positions: \n   - We are putting S at position 5? Which we haven\'t tested? That\'s good? \n   - E at position 4? Which we haven\'t tested? \n   Also, no A, R, I? \n   Word: ""COVES"" meaning plural of cove? Valid? \n\n However, let\'s list: \n New letters: C, O, V, E (known) and S (known)? \n\n Actually, we have E and S? So letters: C, O, V, E, S? \n\n This seems good: \n  - Tests new letters C, O, V? \n  - Places E at position 4? Which was previously untested? \n  - Places S at position 5?

I is absent.\n\n Another word: ""MODES"": \n   M1, O2, D3, E4, S5 -> valid? And E at 4, S at 5? \n   We avoid A,R,I? \n   Letters: M,O,D,E,S? \n   E and S present?

We are given two sets of feedback:

1. First guess: ""ARISE""
   - A: absent (x)
   - R: absent (x)
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: present, wrong position (-)
   - E: present, wrong position (-)

2. Second guess: ""MODES""
   - M: present, wrong position (-)
   - O: absent (x)
   - D: absent (x)
   - E: present, wrong position (-)
   - S: present, wrong position (-)

From this, we can deduce:

- **Absent letters**: A, R, I, O, D (from both guesses, since they got 'x').
- **Present letters**: S, E, M (because M got '-' in the second guess, meaning it's in the word but not in the correct position).

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains S, E, and M.
- It does not contain A, R, I, O, D.

Additionally, we have information about the positions:

From ""ARISE"":
- S was in position 4: but we know it's not there (got '-'). Similarly, E was in position 5: not there.

From ""MODES"":
- M was in position 1: but got '-', so M is not in position 1.
- E was in position 4: not correct (got '-'), so E is not in position 4.
- S was in position 5: not correct (got '-'), so S is not in position 5.

We now must form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains the letters M, S, E (which we know are present).
- Contains exactly two more letters (since the word is 5 letters) from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters (A, R, I, O, D). But note: we don't know if there are more letters present? Actually, we don't know the full set yet.

We also know:
- The word does not have S in position 4 (from first guess) or position 5 (from second guess) → so S must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- E is not in position 5 (from first guess) or position 4 (from second guess) → so E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- M is not in position 1 (from second guess) → so M must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Moreover, we must consider that the positions for E and S might overlap? But they must be distinct since we don't know about duplicate letters? However, we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But so far, we haven't encountered duplicates? 

Thus, we must form a valid word with M, E, S and two new distinct letters? We'll get feedback on the new letters.

We need to avoid using the absent letters: A, R, I, O, D.

Also, we have constraints on positions for M, E, S as above.

Now, what positions did we already test for E and S? In ""ARISE"", E was at 5, S at 4? So that leaves E at 1,2,3 and S at 1,2,3. But also, in ""MODES"", M was at 1? So M cannot be at 1? 

Possible positions:
- E: 1,2,3
- S: 1,2,3
- M: 2,3,4,5

But E and S might compete for positions? We need to assign one letter per position.

Moreover, we need to introduce new letters to test? 

Since we know three letters: M, E, S? So the word is: positions? We need to assign M, E, S to positions? Plus two new letters.

But we don't know the exact positions? So we must use positions that haven't been ruled out? And avoid placing them in known forbidden positions.

For example, E cannot be at 4 or 5? And S cannot be at 4 or 5? And M cannot be at 1? 

Therefore, positions for E and S are limited to 1,2,3? And similarly, M can be anywhere? 

Actually, let me list the positions:

Position 1: cannot be M? From the second guess: M was at position 1 and got '-'. Also, we know E might be at 1? But E was never tested at position 1? Similarly, S might be at 1? 

Also, the secret word must have E, S, M? So we can now form words that arrange E, S, M at the remaining positions and add two new letters.

But note: the letter E and S cannot be at positions we know they are not? For example, S cannot be at 4 or 5? And similarly, E cannot be at 4 or 5? 

Let me consider: we have positions 1,2,3 available for E and S? But we have to include M? Where? But M cannot be at 1? So M could be at the remaining positions? 

So the word must have:

Position 1: either E, S, or a new letter? But E and S cannot be at the positions already ruled out? 

Possible:

We can try S at position 1: but that's allowed? Since we haven't tested S at 1? Similarly, E at position 1? 

Let me think of common words with M, E, S? 

We must avoid O, D, A, R, I? 

Other common letters: L, N, T, P, U, C, B, G, etc.

Example: ""MESSY""? But we don't know Y? Also, we have two S? Might be? But let's check: 

We know S is present? So the secret word might have two S? Could be? 

But we want to test? 

Alternatively: ""SEEMS"": 
- S at position 1? 
- E at position 2? 
- E at position 3? But duplicate E? 
- M at position 4? 
- S at position 5? 

But E at position 4? Wait: ""SEEMS"" -> S1, E2, E3, M4, S5? 
But we know E cannot be at position 5? Wait, position 4 and 5: 
- Position 4: we tested E at position 4 in ""MODES""? We got '-'? So E is not at position 4? But in ""SEEMS"", E is at positions 2 and 3? 
Then M is at position 4? And S at position 5? 

But we know S cannot be at position 5? From ""MODES""? 

Also, we know E is present? But we don't know how many? The feedback counts? 

However, we already know E is present? 

But ""SEEMS"" uses two E and two S? This might be messy? 

How about ""STEMS"": 
- S1, T2, E3, M4, S5? 
But S at position 5? We know S cannot be at 5? 

Similarly, not? 

How about ""MEETS"": 
- M1, E2, E3, T4, S5? 
But M at position 1? We know M cannot be at 1? Because in ""MODES"" M was at position 1 and got '-'? 
And S at position 5? Also not allowed? 

So we avoid S at 5 and M at 1? 

How about putting M, E, S in positions that are allowed? 

Let me try: 
Position 1: cannot be M? Also, we are free to put E or S? Or a new letter? 

But we must assign positions? 

Constraints:
- S must be in positions 1,2,3? 
- E must be in positions 1,2,3? 
- M must be in positions 2,3,4,5?

But note: positions 1,2,3 must accommodate both E and S? Are there enough positions? There are three positions? 

But M must also be placed? But M might be in 4 or 5? 

Alternatively: E and S are in 1 and 2? Then position 3 could be M? But M can be? 

Then positions 4 and 5: new letters? 

For example: 
Word: S1, E2, M3, new1 at position 4, new2 at position 5?

But is that possible? 

But wait: we know E and S cannot be at positions 4 and 5? So that arrangement avoids that? 

Now, positions: S at 1? Not tested before? But in ""ARISE"" S was at 4? Not 1? Similarly ""MODES"" S at 5? Not 1? 

E at position 2? Not tested? 

Similarly, M at position 3? We tested M at position 1? Not at 3? 

Now, what new letters? Avoid absent letters: A, R, I, O, D? 

Common remaining letters: L, N, T, P, U, C, etc.

Examples: ""SEMPT"": not a word? 
How about ""SEMIT"": but I? Absent? 

""SELFS"": F? And S? 
""SELFS"" might be? Self plural? But usually ""selves"". 

""SEMEN"": E? and M? But we have E twice? 
S1, E2, M3, E4, N5? 
But E at position 4? We know E cannot be at 4? Because we tested in ""MODES"" E at position 4? So 'x'? Meaning not correct? So E cannot be at position 4? 
Thus, ""SEMEN"" puts E at position 4? Which we know is wrong? So we must avoid? 

Then let me consider: 
Word: ""SEMIS""? 
- S1, E2, M3, I4, S5? But I? Absent? I not allowed? 

Alternatively: E? Then S at another? 

How about E at position 1? Then S at 2 or 3? 

Word: E1, S2, M3, ...? 

For example: ""ESSMY""? Not word? 
""ESTRU"": no? 

Or we can put M in another position? 

Another possibility: E at position 1? 
Then M at position 4? This avoids positions: 
 Position 1: E? Allowed? Because we didn't test E at 1? 
 Position 2: new? 
 Position 3: new? 
 Position 4: M? Allowed? Because we tested M at position 1? Not at 4? 
 Position 5: new? But S must be at position 2 or 3? Since S cannot be at 4 or 5? 

So if E is at 1, S must be at 2 or 3? 

Example: E1, S2, T3, M4, N5? -> ""ESTMN""? Not a word? 

""ESMUS"": No? 

""ESMAN""? Puts M at 3, S at 2? 

Actually, we have S at position 2? Then E at 1? 

Word: ""ESMON"": O? Absent? 

We need to choose new letters that form words? 

List: 
We want words with E and S and M? With E at 1? and S at 2? then M at 4? 

Possible: ""ESPRM""? Not? 

Know? ""ESPN""? 4? 

Or ""ESP""? Not 5?

Another: ""ESCOT"": O? Absent? 

How about ""SCENE""?: 
But E? 
""SCENE"": S1, C2, E3, N4, E5? 
Wait: 
 S at position 1? 
 E at position 3 and 5? 
 But we cannot have E at position 5? Because we know E is not at 5? 

Also, E at position 3? That might be new? 

But then: S at 1? E at 3? Then M? Where is M? Not present? 

We must include M? 

So the word must contain M? 

Another idea: M at position 5? Or position 2? 

How about: M cannot be at position 1? Must be in 2-5? 

Try S at position 1? E at position 3? 

Then we need M? Position? And new letters? 

For example: S1, L2, E3, M4, T5? -> ""SLEMT""? Not? 

""SLEPT"": 
- S1, L2, E3, P4, T5? 
But we know E at position 3? Might be? 
M is not included? 

This doesn't have M? 

We must have M? 

How about ""SMELL"": 
- S1, M2, E3, L4, L5? 
But E at position 3? 
M is at position 2? 
Also, repeated L? 

But let's check constraints? 
- S at position 1? Allowed? 
- M at position 2? We tested M at position 1? Not 2? So okay? 
- E at position 3? Not 4 or 5? 

Also, L? Not absent? 

Does ""SMELL"" have E? Yes? 
But ""SMELL"" doesn't use any absent letter? 

But in the first guess? 

But wait: we also have to include E? Yes? We have E? 

Absent letters: A,R,I,O,D? So L is new? 

This might be a candidate? 

But is ""SMELL"" valid? Yes? 

Other words? 

""SMELT"": 
- S1, M2, E3, L4, T5? 
Same as above? 

""SMEWS""? Not common? 

But both ""SMELL"" and ""SMELT"" are valid? 

We also have E at position 3? Which has not been tested? 

But for position 4? 

Alternatively: put S at position 2? 

Example: word ""USURE"" => doesn't work? 

How about: M at position 5? 

For example: S at position 1? E at position 2? M at position 5? Then positions 3 and 4: new? 

Word: ""SEXUM""? Not? 

Or ""SENTM""? No? 

So let's go back: 

We have ""SMELT"": S1, M2, E3, L4, T5

Now? We know S at position 1: not tested? 
M at position 2: not tested? 
E at position 3: not tested? 

Also, L and T are new? 

The constraints: 
- S not at 4 and 5? Here not? 
- E not at 4 and 5? Here not? 
- M not at 1? Here M at 2? 

So it violates nothing? 

But wait: in ""SMELT"", E is at position 3? We haven't tested? 

Similarly, L and T? 

But we might get feedback? 

Another candidate: ""STEMS"", but S at 5? No? 

Or ""SMELL""? 

But I think ""SMELT"" works? 

Also, it doesn't use absent letters? 

So let's use ""SMELT"" as the guess?

But note: ""MODES"" had E and S both as -? So could they be multiple positions? 

This is a guess? 

We might consider other arrangements? 

How about S at position 3? 

For example: E at position 1? M at position 2? S at position 3? 

Word: ""EMBOS""? But O? Absent? 

""EMPLS""? No? 

""EMPTS"": M? 

E1, M2, P3, T4, S5? -> ""EMPTS""? But we know S not at position 5? 

So avoid? 

S cannot be at 5? 

Therefore, the only possible word structures with E and S in 1-3? 

I think ""SMELT"" or ""SMELL"", but ""SMELL"" has repeated L? 

Perhaps ""SMELL"" is not ideal? Because if L is not present? We get two 'x'? 

""SMELT"" might be better? Distinct letters? 

Other words? 

How about ""SMEAR"": has A? Absent? 

""SMITE"": has I? Absent? 

So many words eliminated? 

Then ""SMELT"" seems good? 

Other: ""SMUGS""? No E? 

Must have E? 

So: ""SMEKE""? Not? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""SMELT"". 

But let me confirm: 
- S at position 1: we haven't tested S at 1? 
- M at position 2: we were not forced? Can we test M at 2? 
- E at position 3: not tested? 
- L and T: new letters? 

And it's a valid word?

Yes.

So guess: ""SMELT""
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- From **Guess 1 (""ARISE"")**: 
  - S is present (but not in position 4) and E is present (but not in position 5).
  - A, R, and I are absent.

- From **Guess 2 (""MODES"")**:
  - M is present (but not in position 1).
  - E is present (but not in position 4).
  - S is present (but not in position 5).
  - O and D are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **Present letters**: S, E, M are confirmed in the secret word.
2. **Absent letters**: A, R, I, O, D are not in the secret word.
3. **Position constraints**:
   - S cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (must be 1, 2, or 3).
   - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (must be 1, 2, or 3).
   - M cannot be in position 1 (must be 2, 3, 4, or 5).
4. **Word structure**: The secret word must include S, E, M, and two new letters (not from absent set). Duplicates are possible but unknown.
5. **Strategy**: Test S in a new position (Position 1), E in Position 3 (untested), and M in Position 2 (new), while introducing new common letters (L, T) to gather more feedback.

The word ""SMELT"" fits:
- S in Position 1 (new position for S).
- E in Position 3 (new position for E).
- M in Position 2 (new position for M).
- Avoids absent letters (A, R, I, O, D).
- Uses new letters L and T to probe for presence.

<guess>SMELT</guess>",SMELT,"We are given two sets of feedback:

1. First guess: ""ARISE""
   - A: absent (x)
   - R: absent (x)
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: present, wrong position (-)
   - E: present, wrong position (-)

2. Second guess: ""MODES""
   - M: present, wrong position (-)
   - O: absent (x)
   - D: absent (x)
   - E: present, wrong position (-)
   - S: present, wrong position (-)

From this, we can deduce:

- **Absent letters**: A, R, I, O, D (from both guesses, since they got 'x').
- **Present letters**: S, E, M (because M got '-' in the second guess, meaning it's in the word but not in the correct position).

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains S, E, and M.
- It does not contain A, R, I, O, D.

Additionally, we have information about the positions:

From ""ARISE"":
- S was in position 4: but we know it's not there (got '-'). Similarly, E was in position 5: not there.

From ""MODES"":
- M was in position 1: but got '-', so M is not in position 1.
- E was in position 4: not correct (got '-'), so E is not in position 4.
- S was in position 5: not correct (got '-'), so S is not in position 5.

We now must form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains the letters M, S, E (which we know are present).
- Contains exactly two more letters (since the word is 5 letters) from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters (A, R, I, O, D). But note: we don't know if there are more letters present? Actually, we don't know the full set yet.

We also know:
- The word does not have S in position 4 (from first guess) or position 5 (from second guess) → so S must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- E is not in position 5 (from first guess) or position 4 (from second guess) → so E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- M is not in position 1 (from second guess) → so M must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Moreover, we must consider that the positions for E and S might overlap? But they must be distinct since we don't know about duplicate letters? However, we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But so far, we haven't encountered duplicates? 

Thus, we must form a valid word with M, E, S and two new distinct letters? We'll get feedback on the new letters.

We need to avoid using the absent letters: A, R, I, O, D.

Also, we have constraints on positions for M, E, S as above.

Now, what positions did we already test for E and S? In ""ARISE"", E was at 5, S at 4? So that leaves E at 1,2,3 and S at 1,2,3. But also, in ""MODES"", M was at 1? So M cannot be at 1? 

Possible positions:
- E: 1,2,3
- S: 1,2,3
- M: 2,3,4,5

But E and S might compete for positions? We need to assign one letter per position.

Moreover, we need to introduce new letters to test? 

Since we know three letters: M, E, S? So the word is: positions? We need to assign M, E, S to positions? Plus two new letters.

But we don't know the exact positions? So we must use positions that haven't been ruled out? And avoid placing them in known forbidden positions.

For example, E cannot be at 4 or 5? And S cannot be at 4 or 5? And M cannot be at 1? 

Therefore, positions for E and S are limited to 1,2,3? And similarly, M can be anywhere? 

Actually, let me list the positions:

Position 1: cannot be M? From the second guess: M was at position 1 and got '-'. Also, we know E might be at 1? But E was never tested at position 1? Similarly, S might be at 1? 

Also, the secret word must have E, S, M? So we can now form words that arrange E, S, M at the remaining positions and add two new letters.

But note: the letter E and S cannot be at positions we know they are not? For example, S cannot be at 4 or 5? And similarly, E cannot be at 4 or 5? 

Let me consider: we have positions 1,2,3 available for E and S? But we have to include M? Where? But M cannot be at 1? So M could be at the remaining positions? 

So the word must have:

Position 1: either E, S, or a new letter? But E and S cannot be at the positions already ruled out? 

Possible:

We can try S at position 1: but that's allowed? Since we haven't tested S at 1? Similarly, E at position 1? 

Let me think of common words with M, E, S? 

We must avoid O, D, A, R, I? 

Other common letters: L, N, T, P, U, C, B, G, etc.

Example: ""MESSY""? But we don't know Y? Also, we have two S? Might be? But let's check: 

We know S is present? So the secret word might have two S? Could be? 

But we want to test? 

Alternatively: ""SEEMS"": 
- S at position 1? 
- E at position 2? 
- E at position 3? But duplicate E? 
- M at position 4? 
- S at position 5? 

But E at position 4? Wait: ""SEEMS"" -> S1, E2, E3, M4, S5? 
But we know E cannot be at position 5? Wait, position 4 and 5: 
- Position 4: we tested E at position 4 in ""MODES""? We got '-'? So E is not at position 4? But in ""SEEMS"", E is at positions 2 and 3? 
Then M is at position 4? And S at position 5? 

But we know S cannot be at position 5? From ""MODES""? 

Also, we know E is present? But we don't know how many? The feedback counts? 

However, we already know E is present? 

But ""SEEMS"" uses two E and two S? This might be messy? 

How about ""STEMS"": 
- S1, T2, E3, M4, S5? 
But S at position 5? We know S cannot be at 5? 

Similarly, not? 

How about ""MEETS"": 
- M1, E2, E3, T4, S5? 
But M at position 1? We know M cannot be at 1? Because in ""MODES"" M was at position 1 and got '-'? 
And S at position 5? Also not allowed? 

So we avoid S at 5 and M at 1? 

How about putting M, E, S in positions that are allowed? 

Let me try: 
Position 1: cannot be M? Also, we are free to put E or S? Or a new letter? 

But we must assign positions? 

Constraints:
- S must be in positions 1,2,3? 
- E must be in positions 1,2,3? 
- M must be in positions 2,3,4,5?

But note: positions 1,2,3 must accommodate both E and S? Are there enough positions? There are three positions? 

But M must also be placed? But M might be in 4 or 5? 

Alternatively: E and S are in 1 and 2? Then position 3 could be M? But M can be? 

Then positions 4 and 5: new letters? 

For example: 
Word: S1, E2, M3, new1 at position 4, new2 at position 5?

But is that possible? 

But wait: we know E and S cannot be at positions 4 and 5? So that arrangement avoids that? 

Now, positions: S at 1? Not tested before? But in ""ARISE"" S was at 4? Not 1? Similarly ""MODES"" S at 5? Not 1? 

E at position 2? Not tested? 

Similarly, M at position 3? We tested M at position 1? Not at 3? 

Now, what new letters? Avoid absent letters: A, R, I, O, D? 

Common remaining letters: L, N, T, P, U, C, etc.

Examples: ""SEMPT"": not a word? 
How about ""SEMIT"": but I? Absent? 

""SELFS"": F? And S? 
""SELFS"" might be? Self plural? But usually ""selves"". 

""SEMEN"": E? and M? But we have E twice? 
S1, E2, M3, E4, N5? 
But E at position 4? We know E cannot be at 4? Because we tested in ""MODES"" E at position 4? So 'x'? Meaning not correct? So E cannot be at position 4? 
Thus, ""SEMEN"" puts E at position 4? Which we know is wrong? So we must avoid? 

Then let me consider: 
Word: ""SEMIS""? 
- S1, E2, M3, I4, S5? But I? Absent? I not allowed? 

Alternatively: E? Then S at another? 

How about E at position 1? Then S at 2 or 3? 

Word: E1, S2, M3, ...? 

For example: ""ESSMY""? Not word? 
""ESTRU"": no? 

Or we can put M in another position? 

Another possibility: E at position 1? 
Then M at position 4? This avoids positions: 
 Position 1: E? Allowed? Because we didn't test E at 1? 
 Position 2: new? 
 Position 3: new? 
 Position 4: M? Allowed? Because we tested M at position 1? Not at 4? 
 Position 5: new? But S must be at position 2 or 3? Since S cannot be at 4 or 5? 

So if E is at 1, S must be at 2 or 3? 

Example: E1, S2, T3, M4, N5? -> ""ESTMN""? Not a word? 

""ESMUS"": No? 

""ESMAN""? Puts M at 3, S at 2? 

Actually, we have S at position 2? Then E at 1? 

Word: ""ESMON"": O? Absent? 

We need to choose new letters that form words? 

List: 
We want words with E and S and M? With E at 1? and S at 2? then M at 4? 

Possible: ""ESPRM""? Not? 

Know? ""ESPN""? 4? 

Or ""ESP""? Not 5?

Another: ""ESCOT"": O? Absent? 

How about ""SCENE""?: 
But E? 
""SCENE"": S1, C2, E3, N4, E5? 
Wait: 
 S at position 1? 
 E at position 3 and 5? 
 But we cannot have E at position 5? Because we know E is not at 5? 

Also, E at position 3? That might be new? 

But then: S at 1? E at 3? Then M? Where is M? Not present? 

We must include M? 

So the word must contain M? 

Another idea: M at position 5? Or position 2? 

How about: M cannot be at position 1? Must be in 2-5? 

Try S at position 1? E at position 3? 

Then we need M? Position? And new letters? 

For example: S1, L2, E3, M4, T5? -> ""SLEMT""? Not? 

""SLEPT"": 
- S1, L2, E3, P4, T5? 
But we know E at position 3? Might be? 
M is not included? 

This doesn't have M? 

We must have M? 

How about ""SMELL"": 
- S1, M2, E3, L4, L5? 
But E at position 3? 
M is at position 2? 
Also, repeated L? 

But let's check constraints? 
- S at position 1? Allowed? 
- M at position 2? We tested M at position 1? Not 2? So okay? 
- E at position 3? Not 4 or 5? 

Also, L? Not absent? 

Does ""SMELL"" have E? Yes? 
But ""SMELL"" doesn't use any absent letter? 

But in the first guess? 

But wait: we also have to include E? Yes? We have E? 

Absent letters: A,R,I,O,D? So L is new? 

This might be a candidate? 

But is ""SMELL"" valid? Yes? 

Other words? 

""SMELT"": 
- S1, M2, E3, L4, T5? 
Same as above? 

""SMEWS""? Not common? 

But both ""SMELL"" and ""SMELT"" are valid? 

We also have E at position 3? Which has not been tested? 

But for position 4? 

Alternatively: put S at position 2? 

Example: word ""USURE"" => doesn't work? 

How about: M at position 5? 

For example: S at position 1? E at position 2? M at position 5? Then positions 3 and 4: new? 

Word: ""SEXUM""? Not? 

Or ""SENTM""? No? 

So let's go back: 

We have ""SMELT"": S1, M2, E3, L4, T5

Now? We know S at position 1: not tested? 
M at position 2: not tested? 
E at position 3: not tested? 

Also, L and T are new? 

The constraints: 
- S not at 4 and 5? Here not? 
- E not at 4 and 5? Here not? 
- M not at 1? Here M at 2? 

So it violates nothing? 

But wait: in ""SMELT"", E is at position 3? We haven't tested? 

Similarly, L and T? 

But we might get feedback? 

Another candidate: ""STEMS"", but S at 5? No? 

Or ""SMELL""? 

But I think ""SMELT"" works? 

Also, it doesn't use absent letters? 

So let's use ""SMELT"" as the guess?

But note: ""MODES"" had E and S both as -? So could they be multiple positions? 

This is a guess? 

We might consider other arrangements? 

How about S at position 3? 

For example: E at position 1? M at position 2? S at position 3? 

Word: ""EMBOS""? But O? Absent? 

""EMPLS""? No? 

""EMPTS"": M? 

E1, M2, P3, T4, S5? -> ""EMPTS""? But we know S not at position 5? 

So avoid? 

S cannot be at 5? 

Therefore, the only possible word structures with E and S in 1-3? 

I think ""SMELT"" or ""SMELL"", but ""SMELL"" has repeated L? 

Perhaps ""SMELL"" is not ideal? Because if L is not present? We get two 'x'? 

""SMELT"" might be better? Distinct letters? 

Other words? 

How about ""SMEAR"": has A? Absent? 

""SMITE"": has I? Absent? 

So many words eliminated? 

Then ""SMELT"" seems good? 

Other: ""SMUGS""? No E? 

Must have E? 

So: ""SMEKE""? Not? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""SMELT"". 

But let me confirm: 
- S at position 1: we haven't tested S at 1? 
- M at position 2: we were not forced? Can we test M at 2? 
- E at position 3: not tested? 
- L and T: new letters? 

And it's a valid word?

Yes.

So guess: ""SMELT""Based on the previous feedback:

- From **Guess 1 (""ARISE"")**: 
  - S is present (but not in position 4) and E is present (but not in position 5).
  - A, R, and I are absent.

- From **Guess 2 (""MODES"")**:
  - M is present (but not in position 1).
  - E is present (but not in position 4).
  - S is present (but not in position 5).
  - O and D are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **Present letters**: S, E, M are confirmed in the secret word.
2. **Absent letters**: A, R, I, O, D are not in the secret word.
3. **Position constraints**:
   - S cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (must be 1, 2, or 3).
   - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (must be 1, 2, or 3).
   - M cannot be in position 1 (must be 2, 3, 4, or 5).
4. **Word structure**: The secret word must include S, E, M, and two new letters (not from absent set). Duplicates are possible but unknown.
5. **Strategy**: Test S in a new position (Position 1), E in Position 3 (untested), and M in Position 2 (new), while introducing new common letters (L, T) to gather more feedback.

The word ""SMELT"" fits:
- S in Position 1 (new position for S).
- E in Position 3 (new position for E).
- M in Position 2 (new position for M).
- Avoids absent letters (A, R, I, O, D).
- Uses new letters L and T to probe for presence.",Guess 3: SMELT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(✓) E(✓) L(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
