We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the secret word)
R: x (not in the secret word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the secret word)
E: x (not in the secret word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word does not contain C, R, N, or E.
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A was the third letter and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).

Therefore, the secret word has the letter A, and it must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is already wrong).

We also know that the secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (to try to find its correct position) and
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word) and
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Let's think of words that have the letter A and other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like S, T, L, I, O, etc.).

We also note that the letter A cannot be in the third position (from the first guess), so we should try A in a different position.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

We might try to put A in the first position for the next guess to see if it's there.

But we also want to cover other common letters. Let's consider the word ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, we have only one A known so far.

Alternatively, we can try a word with A in the second position? Or fourth? 

Let me think of common words without C, R, N, E.

Some options:
- ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's? We don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have A in the second and fifth positions? But we don't know the frequency.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one A as present, but if the word had two A's, we would still only see one '-'? Actually, no. The feedback would show a '-' for every occurrence of A that is in the word but not in the correct position? But wait, if the word has two A's and we have one A in the guess, then we might only get one '-' and the other A might be in the correct position? But in our case, we only have one A in the guess and we got a '-', meaning there is at least one A in the word. There could be more.

But to be safe, we should avoid duplicate letters for now to get clearer information.

So, let's try a word with A and four new distinct letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, P, M, etc.

We can try ""SLATE"", but wait: E is in ""slate"" and we know E is not in the word (from first feedback). So we cannot use E.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, N, E.

So, we must avoid: C, R, N, E.

Let me try to form a word with A and without C, R, N, E.

Possible words: 
- ""PASTA"": has A twice and T, S, P. But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we are avoiding E? Yes, but ""pasta"" doesn't have E. However, it has two A's. We might get confused if the word has one A or two.

Alternatively, ""PLAIT"" -> but that has I and T, but we don't know. Also, it's less common.

Another idea: ""TALON"" -> but N is in it, and we know N is not in the word.

We must avoid N.

So, let's think of words without C, R, N, E and with A.

Common words: 
- ""SALAD"" -> has two A's and D, L, S. But two A's.
- ""ALIAS"" -> two A's and two S's? Not good for information.

We want a word with A and four other distinct letters that are not C, R, N, E.

How about ""AUDIO""? That has A, U, D, I, O. All distinct and none of the forbidden letters.

But is ""AUDIO"" a valid word? Yes, it is.

We can try ""AUDIO"". This way, we test A in the first position and also test U, D, I, O.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in the third position and it was present but wrong position. So if we put A in the first position, we might get:
- If A is in the first position in the secret word, then we get a check (✓) for A.
- If not, then we get a '-' again, meaning A is in the word but not in first position, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Also, we test four new letters: U, D, I, O.

So, let's go with ""AUDIO"".

But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? We are avoiding that for now to get clear feedback.

Alternatively, we can try ""PAINT"" but that has N and T? N is forbidden. So no.

Another word: ""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. This avoids C, R, N, E. And all distinct.

But we have A in the second position? We can try that.

We can also try ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P. Avoids C, R, N, E. And distinct letters.

But note: we don't know if S, T, M, P are in the word. So either ""AUDIO"" or ""STAMP"" or ""MAILS"".

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because it has vowels and we can get information about which vowels are present.

But the secret word might not have U, D, I, O. We don't know.

Alternatively, ""STAMP"" has more common consonants.

Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

Common consonants: S, T, L, P, M, etc.
Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. But we know E is out, so we can try I and O.

But we already know A is in, so we need to find consonants.

I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because:
- S and T are very common.
- We put A in the third position? But wait, in the first guess, A was in the third position and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not in third. So if we put A in the third position again, we will get a '-' again? Because it's the same wrong position? Actually, we know it's not in third, so we should avoid putting A in third.

In ""STAMP"", A is in the third position. But we already know that A is not in the third position (from first guess). So if we put A in the third again, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't give us new information about the position of A. We want to test a new position.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.

In ""AUDIO"", A is in the first position -> new position.
In ""MAILS"", A is in the second position -> new position.
In ""STAMP"", A is in the third -> same as before, so avoid.

So, let's choose between ""AUDIO"" and ""MAILS"".

We can also consider ""PLAIT"" but that has T and I, and A in third? Again, third position for A is bad.

Another word: ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden.

""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y. Avoids C, R, N, E. And A in second position.

So, ""DAILY"" is an option.

But let's go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests four vowels and we know the word has at least one vowel (A) and we can check for others.

But note: the word might have more vowels or consonants.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has A and common consonants.

I think ""MAILS"" is a good choice: M, A, I, L, S. A in second position.

Similarly, ""DAILY"" is also good.

But let me see: we have to avoid the letters we know are not present: C, R, N, E.

So, I'll choose ""MAILS"".

But wait, in ""MAILS"", we have A in the second position. We hope to get information about whether A is in the second position or not.

If we get a check for A, then we know it's in second. If we get a '-', then we know A is not in second, so it must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Also, we test M, I, L, S.

So, let's go with ""MAILS"".

But note: the word ""MAILS"" is valid.

Alternatively, ""SALAD"" is also valid but has duplicate A.

I think ""MAILS"" is better.

Another common word: ""PLAIT"" but A is in third? We avoid third.

""TOPAZ"": T, O, P, A, Z -> A in fourth position. That's good. And distinct letters.

But Z is less common.

""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. Avoids C, R, N, E.

""ABOUT"" is a good candidate.

But we have two options: ""ABOUT"" (A in first) and ""MAILS"" (A in second).

I think both are fine. Let me pick ""ABOUT"" because it has more common letters? Or ""MAILS""?

We can also consider ""ADIEU"", but E is forbidden? ""ADIEU"" has E, which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

So, ""ABOUT"" is okay.

But let's decide: I'll go with ""ABOUT"" because it tests A in the first position and B, O, U, T.

So, our second guess: ""ABOUT""

But note: we are not sure if the word has B, O, U, T. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can use ""STOMP"" but that doesn't have A? We must include A because we know it's in the word. Otherwise, we won't get information about A.

So, we must include A in the guess.

Therefore, we choose a word that includes A and four new letters.

So, ""ABOUT"" is a valid choice.

Let me write it: A in first, B in second, O in third, U in fourth, T in fifth.

We'll see the feedback.

So, the guess is ""about"".

But note: the word ""about"" is 5 letters and valid.

So, I'll go with that.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with ""-"").

Key insights:
- The secret word contains the letter A, which must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect).
- Avoid using C, R, N, E in future guesses.
- For the second guess, prioritize a word that:
  - Includes A in a new position (not position 3) to test its location.
  - Uses common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, B, U) to maximize information.
  - Avoids duplicate letters for clearer feedback.

After evaluating options like ""audio"" (A in position 1), ""mails"" (A in position 2), and ""about"" (A in position 1), ""about"" was selected because:
- It tests A in position 1 (a new position to verify).
- It introduces four new common letters (B, O, U, T) not yet tested.
- All letters are distinct, simplifying feedback interpretation.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the secret word)
R: x (not in the secret word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the secret word)
E: x (not in the secret word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word does not contain C, R, N, or E.
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A was the third letter and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).

Therefore, the secret word has the letter A, and it must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is already wrong).

We also know that the secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (to try to find its correct position) and
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word) and
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Let's think of words that have the letter A and other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like S, T, L, I, O, etc.).

We also note that the letter A cannot be in the third position (from the first guess), so we should try A in a different position.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

We might try to put A in the first position for the next guess to see if it's there.

But we also want to cover other common letters. Let's consider the word ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, we have only one A known so far.

Alternatively, we can try a word with A in the second position? Or fourth? 

Let me think of common words without C, R, N, E.

Some options:
- ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's? We don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have A in the second and fifth positions? But we don't know the frequency.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one A as present, but if the word had two A's, we would still only see one '-'? Actually, no. The feedback would show a '-' for every occurrence of A that is in the word but not in the correct position? But wait, if the word has two A's and we have one A in the guess, then we might only get one '-' and the other A might be in the correct position? But in our case, we only have one A in the guess and we got a '-', meaning there is at least one A in the word. There could be more.

But to be safe, we should avoid duplicate letters for now to get clearer information.

So, let's try a word with A and four new distinct letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, P, M, etc.

We can try ""SLATE"", but wait: E is in ""slate"" and we know E is not in the word (from first feedback). So we cannot use E.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, N, E.

So, we must avoid: C, R, N, E.

Let me try to form a word with A and without C, R, N, E.

Possible words: 
- ""PASTA"": has A twice and T, S, P. But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we are avoiding E? Yes, but ""pasta"" doesn't have E. However, it has two A's. We might get confused if the word has one A or two.

Alternatively, ""PLAIT"" -> but that has I and T, but we don't know. Also, it's less common.

Another idea: ""TALON"" -> but N is in it, and we know N is not in the word.

We must avoid N.

So, let's think of words without C, R, N, E and with A.

Common words: 
- ""SALAD"" -> has two A's and D, L, S. But two A's.
- ""ALIAS"" -> two A's and two S's? Not good for information.

We want a word with A and four other distinct letters that are not C, R, N, E.

How about ""AUDIO""? That has A, U, D, I, O. All distinct and none of the forbidden letters.

But is ""AUDIO"" a valid word? Yes, it is.

We can try ""AUDIO"". This way, we test A in the first position and also test U, D, I, O.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in the third position and it was present but wrong position. So if we put A in the first position, we might get:
- If A is in the first position in the secret word, then we get a check (✓) for A.
- If not, then we get a '-' again, meaning A is in the word but not in first position, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Also, we test four new letters: U, D, I, O.

So, let's go with ""AUDIO"".

But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? We are avoiding that for now to get clear feedback.

Alternatively, we can try ""PAINT"" but that has N and T? N is forbidden. So no.

Another word: ""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. This avoids C, R, N, E. And all distinct.

But we have A in the second position? We can try that.

We can also try ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P. Avoids C, R, N, E. And distinct letters.

But note: we don't know if S, T, M, P are in the word. So either ""AUDIO"" or ""STAMP"" or ""MAILS"".

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because it has vowels and we can get information about which vowels are present.

But the secret word might not have U, D, I, O. We don't know.

Alternatively, ""STAMP"" has more common consonants.

Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

Common consonants: S, T, L, P, M, etc.
Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. But we know E is out, so we can try I and O.

But we already know A is in, so we need to find consonants.

I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because:
- S and T are very common.
- We put A in the third position? But wait, in the first guess, A was in the third position and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not in third. So if we put A in the third position again, we will get a '-' again? Because it's the same wrong position? Actually, we know it's not in third, so we should avoid putting A in third.

In ""STAMP"", A is in the third position. But we already know that A is not in the third position (from first guess). So if we put A in the third again, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't give us new information about the position of A. We want to test a new position.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.

In ""AUDIO"", A is in the first position -> new position.
In ""MAILS"", A is in the second position -> new position.
In ""STAMP"", A is in the third -> same as before, so avoid.

So, let's choose between ""AUDIO"" and ""MAILS"".

We can also consider ""PLAIT"" but that has T and I, and A in third? Again, third position for A is bad.

Another word: ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden.

""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y. Avoids C, R, N, E. And A in second position.

So, ""DAILY"" is an option.

But let's go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests four vowels and we know the word has at least one vowel (A) and we can check for others.

But note: the word might have more vowels or consonants.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has A and common consonants.

I think ""MAILS"" is a good choice: M, A, I, L, S. A in second position.

Similarly, ""DAILY"" is also good.

But let me see: we have to avoid the letters we know are not present: C, R, N, E.

So, I'll choose ""MAILS"".

But wait, in ""MAILS"", we have A in the second position. We hope to get information about whether A is in the second position or not.

If we get a check for A, then we know it's in second. If we get a '-', then we know A is not in second, so it must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Also, we test M, I, L, S.

So, let's go with ""MAILS"".

But note: the word ""MAILS"" is valid.

Alternatively, ""SALAD"" is also valid but has duplicate A.

I think ""MAILS"" is better.

Another common word: ""PLAIT"" but A is in third? We avoid third.

""TOPAZ"": T, O, P, A, Z -> A in fourth position. That's good. And distinct letters.

But Z is less common.

""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. Avoids C, R, N, E.

""ABOUT"" is a good candidate.

But we have two options: ""ABOUT"" (A in first) and ""MAILS"" (A in second).

I think both are fine. Let me pick ""ABOUT"" because it has more common letters? Or ""MAILS""?

We can also consider ""ADIEU"", but E is forbidden? ""ADIEU"" has E, which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

So, ""ABOUT"" is okay.

But let's decide: I'll go with ""ABOUT"" because it tests A in the first position and B, O, U, T.

So, our second guess: ""ABOUT""

But note: we are not sure if the word has B, O, U, T. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can use ""STOMP"" but that doesn't have A? We must include A because we know it's in the word. Otherwise, we won't get information about A.

So, we must include A in the guess.

Therefore, we choose a word that includes A and four new letters.

So, ""ABOUT"" is a valid choice.

Let me write it: A in first, B in second, O in third, U in fourth, T in fifth.

We'll see the feedback.

So, the guess is ""about"".

But note: the word ""about"" is 5 letters and valid.

So, I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with ""-"").

Key insights:
- The secret word contains the letter A, which must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect).
- Avoid using C, R, N, E in future guesses.
- For the second guess, prioritize a word that:
  - Includes A in a new position (not position 3) to test its location.
  - Uses common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, B, U) to maximize information.
  - Avoids duplicate letters for clearer feedback.

After evaluating options like ""audio"" (A in position 1), ""mails"" (A in position 2), and ""about"" (A in position 1), ""about"" was selected because:
- It tests A in position 1 (a new position to verify).
- It introduces four new common letters (B, O, U, T) not yet tested.
- All letters are distinct, simplifying feedback interpretation.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""about""
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 1)
- B: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- U: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)

Now, combining the information:

1. The secret word has the letter 'A' in the first position (from guess 2: A is correct and in position 1).
2. Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T (from both guesses, all marked with x).
3. We know the word starts with 'A'.

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with 'A'
- Does not contain: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T
- And from the first guess, we know that the word has an 'A' but not in position 3. However, now we know that 'A' is in position 1, so that condition is satisfied.

Since we have the first letter fixed as 'A', we need to guess the remaining four letters.

We have eliminated many common letters. The available letters are the remaining consonants and vowels that haven't been tried.

Available letters (from the alphabet, excluding the known absent ones: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U).

So, absent letters: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to form a word starting with 'A' and using only the available letters.

Common words starting with 'A' without the forbidden letters:

- ""APPLE"": but has P and L, but also E? E is forbidden. So no.
- ""ANGRY"": has N and R? Both forbidden. No.
- ""ALIEN"": has E and N? Forbidden. No.
- ""ADIEU"": has E and U? Forbidden. No.

Let's think of words starting with 'A' and using only D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:

- ""ALPHA"": A, L, P, H, A -> but has two A's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have A in first, so the last A would be in position 5. But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, we can try.

But let's check the letters: A (first), L, P, H, A (fifth). The available letters are fine (L, P, H are available). But we have two A's. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. So it's acceptable.

But we might get ambiguous feedback if there is only one A? Actually, since the first A is correct, the last A might be marked as absent if not in the word, or present if it is.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate A to avoid confusion.

Other words:

- ""AMPLY"": A, M, P, L, Y -> all letters available. And distinct except? All distinct: A, M, P, L, Y.

""AMPLY"" is a word meaning ""in an ample manner"".

- ""APPLY"": but has P, P, L, Y? And A. But two P's? And E? No, ""apply"" is A, P, P, L, Y. But we have two P's. Also, no E. But we don't know about duplicates. And P is available.

But ""apply"" has two P's, which might complicate.

- ""ALLY"": only 4 letters? No, we need 5.

5-letter words:

- ""ALIGN"": has G and N? N is forbidden. No.
- ""ALIKE"": has E? Forbidden. No.
- ""ALIVE"": has E? Forbidden. No.
- ""ALOUD"": has O and U? Forbidden. No.
- ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> but T is forbidden (from guess 2: T is x). So no.

T is forbidden? From guess 2, T is marked x, so not in the word.

Similarly, O, U, B are forbidden.

So, in ""AMPLY"": A, M, P, L, Y. Check forbidden: M, P, L, Y are not in the forbidden list. And T is not in it. So okay.

But we must avoid T? Yes, T is forbidden.

Another word: ""APHID"": A, P, H, I, D. All available letters: P, H, I, D. And distinct.

""Aphid"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""AVOID"": has O? Forbidden. No.

""AXIAL"": has X, I, A, L. But two A's? And X and I and L are available. But we have A in first and fifth. So duplicate A.

""AMISS"": A, M, I, S, S. Two S's? And M, I, S available.

But duplicate S.

To maximize information, we should prefer words with distinct letters.

So, ""APHID"" has distinct letters: A, P, H, I, D.

""AMPLY"" has distinct letters: A, M, P, L, Y.

Both are good.

We can also consider ""ASKEW"": A, S, K, E, W -> but E is forbidden. No.

""AZURE"": has U and E? Forbidden. No.

""ANVIL"": has N? Forbidden. No.

So, let's choose between ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"".

We might also consider ""ALPHA"" but it has two A's.

Another one: ""ADAPT"": has D, A, P, T -> T is forbidden. No.

""AGILE"": has E? Forbidden. No.

""ALGAE"": has E? Forbidden. No.

""ALMOND"": 6 letters? No.

So, 5-letter words: ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"" are candidates.

We can also consider ""WALTZ"": but doesn't start with A? We need to start with A.

We must start with A.

Another word: ""AWAIT"": has W, A, I, T -> but T is forbidden. And two A's? A in first and third? But T is forbidden.

""AVAIL"": has V, A, I, L -> and two A's? A in first and third? But we have A in first, so the third A might be duplicate. And V, I, L are available.

But duplicate A.

Similarly, ""AORTA"": has O? Forbidden.

So, back to ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"".

We can also consider ""ASHEN"": has E? Forbidden.

""ASPEN"": has E? Forbidden.

""AXIOM"": has O? Forbidden.

""AZOIC"": has O and I? O forbidden.

""ABYSS"": has B and Y, S, S? B forbidden.

So, I think ""APHID"" or ""AMPLY"" are good.

Let's pick ""AMPLY"" because it has more common letters? M, P, L, Y.

But Y is less common at the end? But it's acceptable.

We can also consider ""AMBER"": has B and E? Forbidden.

So, I'll go with ""AMPLY"".

But let's confirm: 
- A: we know is correct in position 1, so we expect a check for A.
- Then we test M in position 2, P in position 3, L in position 4, Y in position 5.

If any of these are in the word, we get feedback.

We might also get information about duplicate A? But since we don't have another A, we won't.

So, guess: ""AMPLY""

But note: we have to output in the required format.

Alternatively, we can think of other words.

Another word: ""AVID"": only 4 letters.

""APISH"": A, P, I, S, H. All distinct and available: P, I, S, H.

""APISH"" is a word (meaning resembling an ape).

Similarly, ""APHID"" and ""APISH"" are both good.

""AMPLY"" is also good.

I think any of these are fine. Let's choose ""APISH"" because it has S and H, which are common.

But we have no strong preference.

We can also consider ""ASKED"": has E? Forbidden.

""ALPHS"": not a common word.

I'll go with ""APHID"" for now.

But let's see: we have to make a guess.

We can also consider the frequency of letters.

Common letters left: S, L, I, P, M, D, etc.

We can try to cover more common ones.

""APHID"" has P, H, I, D.

""AMPLY"" has M, P, L, Y.

""APISH"" has P, I, S, H.

S is more common than D or Y, so ""APISH"" might be better.

Similarly, H is common.

So, let's choose ""APISH"".

But we must start with A, so ""APISH"": A (position 1), P (2), I (3), S (4), H (5).

We know A is correct in position 1, so we are testing P, I, S, H.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So, I'll go with ""apish"".

But let's write it.

Alternatively, we can use ""ASHAM"" but that has two A's? A in first and fourth? And S, H, M. But ""asham"" is not a word? I think ""asham"" is not standard. ""ASHAM"" might be a name, but not common.

""ASHEN"" has E.

So, ""APISH"" is valid.

Another common word: ""ASPIC"" but C is forbidden.

So, I think ""APISH"" is acceptable.

But let's confirm the word: ""apish"" is an adjective meaning ""foolishly silly"" or ""resembling an ape"".

In Wordle, it might be in the dictionary.

Similarly, ""APHID"" is a noun.

Both are valid.

I'll choose ""APISH"" to include S.

So, the guess is ""apish"".

But note: in the feedback, we will get:

- A: ✓ (since we know it's correct in position 1)
- P: ? 
- I: ?
- S: ?
- H: ?

And we'll see which are present and in what positions.

So, <guess>apish</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Eliminated letters C, R, N, E (all marked ""x""), and confirmed A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- **Guess 2 (""about"")**: Confirmed A is in position 1 (marked ""✓""), and eliminated B, O, U, T (all marked ""x"").

### Current Knowledge:
- **Correct position**: A is the first letter (position 1).
- **Eliminated letters**: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U (cannot appear in the word).
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Word structure**: Starts with A, followed by four letters from the available set. The word must be a valid English word.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize words starting with A and using common unused letters (e.g., S, L, I, P, M, H) to maximize information.
- Avoid eliminated letters and duplicate letters for clearer feedback.
- Test potential letters in new positions to narrow down possibilities.

Selected guess: **""APISH""** (meaning ""foolishly silly"" or ""resembling an ape"").  
- Why ""APISH""?  
  - Starts with A (confirmed position 1).  
  - Uses distinct, common available letters: P (position 2), I (position 3), S (position 4), H (position 5).  
  - Tests high-frequency consonants (S, P, H) and a vowel (I), which could reveal more about the word's structure.  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and duplicates.  

This guess will provide feedback on P, I, S, and H, helping to identify correct letters and their positions for the next guess.

<guess>apish</guess>",apish,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""about""
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 1)
- B: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- U: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)

Now, combining the information:

1. The secret word has the letter 'A' in the first position (from guess 2: A is correct and in position 1).
2. Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T (from both guesses, all marked with x).
3. We know the word starts with 'A'.

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with 'A'
- Does not contain: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T
- And from the first guess, we know that the word has an 'A' but not in position 3. However, now we know that 'A' is in position 1, so that condition is satisfied.

Since we have the first letter fixed as 'A', we need to guess the remaining four letters.

We have eliminated many common letters. The available letters are the remaining consonants and vowels that haven't been tried.

Available letters (from the alphabet, excluding the known absent ones: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U).

So, absent letters: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to form a word starting with 'A' and using only the available letters.

Common words starting with 'A' without the forbidden letters:

- ""APPLE"": but has P and L, but also E? E is forbidden. So no.
- ""ANGRY"": has N and R? Both forbidden. No.
- ""ALIEN"": has E and N? Forbidden. No.
- ""ADIEU"": has E and U? Forbidden. No.

Let's think of words starting with 'A' and using only D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:

- ""ALPHA"": A, L, P, H, A -> but has two A's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have A in first, so the last A would be in position 5. But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, we can try.

But let's check the letters: A (first), L, P, H, A (fifth). The available letters are fine (L, P, H are available). But we have two A's. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. So it's acceptable.

But we might get ambiguous feedback if there is only one A? Actually, since the first A is correct, the last A might be marked as absent if not in the word, or present if it is.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate A to avoid confusion.

Other words:

- ""AMPLY"": A, M, P, L, Y -> all letters available. And distinct except? All distinct: A, M, P, L, Y.

""AMPLY"" is a word meaning ""in an ample manner"".

- ""APPLY"": but has P, P, L, Y? And A. But two P's? And E? No, ""apply"" is A, P, P, L, Y. But we have two P's. Also, no E. But we don't know about duplicates. And P is available.

But ""apply"" has two P's, which might complicate.

- ""ALLY"": only 4 letters? No, we need 5.

5-letter words:

- ""ALIGN"": has G and N? N is forbidden. No.
- ""ALIKE"": has E? Forbidden. No.
- ""ALIVE"": has E? Forbidden. No.
- ""ALOUD"": has O and U? Forbidden. No.
- ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> but T is forbidden (from guess 2: T is x). So no.

T is forbidden? From guess 2, T is marked x, so not in the word.

Similarly, O, U, B are forbidden.

So, in ""AMPLY"": A, M, P, L, Y. Check forbidden: M, P, L, Y are not in the forbidden list. And T is not in it. So okay.

But we must avoid T? Yes, T is forbidden.

Another word: ""APHID"": A, P, H, I, D. All available letters: P, H, I, D. And distinct.

""Aphid"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""AVOID"": has O? Forbidden. No.

""AXIAL"": has X, I, A, L. But two A's? And X and I and L are available. But we have A in first and fifth. So duplicate A.

""AMISS"": A, M, I, S, S. Two S's? And M, I, S available.

But duplicate S.

To maximize information, we should prefer words with distinct letters.

So, ""APHID"" has distinct letters: A, P, H, I, D.

""AMPLY"" has distinct letters: A, M, P, L, Y.

Both are good.

We can also consider ""ASKEW"": A, S, K, E, W -> but E is forbidden. No.

""AZURE"": has U and E? Forbidden. No.

""ANVIL"": has N? Forbidden. No.

So, let's choose between ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"".

We might also consider ""ALPHA"" but it has two A's.

Another one: ""ADAPT"": has D, A, P, T -> T is forbidden. No.

""AGILE"": has E? Forbidden. No.

""ALGAE"": has E? Forbidden. No.

""ALMOND"": 6 letters? No.

So, 5-letter words: ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"" are candidates.

We can also consider ""WALTZ"": but doesn't start with A? We need to start with A.

We must start with A.

Another word: ""AWAIT"": has W, A, I, T -> but T is forbidden. And two A's? A in first and third? But T is forbidden.

""AVAIL"": has V, A, I, L -> and two A's? A in first and third? But we have A in first, so the third A might be duplicate. And V, I, L are available.

But duplicate A.

Similarly, ""AORTA"": has O? Forbidden.

So, back to ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"".

We can also consider ""ASHEN"": has E? Forbidden.

""ASPEN"": has E? Forbidden.

""AXIOM"": has O? Forbidden.

""AZOIC"": has O and I? O forbidden.

""ABYSS"": has B and Y, S, S? B forbidden.

So, I think ""APHID"" or ""AMPLY"" are good.

Let's pick ""AMPLY"" because it has more common letters? M, P, L, Y.

But Y is less common at the end? But it's acceptable.

We can also consider ""AMBER"": has B and E? Forbidden.

So, I'll go with ""AMPLY"".

But let's confirm: 
- A: we know is correct in position 1, so we expect a check for A.
- Then we test M in position 2, P in position 3, L in position 4, Y in position 5.

If any of these are in the word, we get feedback.

We might also get information about duplicate A? But since we don't have another A, we won't.

So, guess: ""AMPLY""

But note: we have to output in the required format.

Alternatively, we can think of other words.

Another word: ""AVID"": only 4 letters.

""APISH"": A, P, I, S, H. All distinct and available: P, I, S, H.

""APISH"" is a word (meaning resembling an ape).

Similarly, ""APHID"" and ""APISH"" are both good.

""AMPLY"" is also good.

I think any of these are fine. Let's choose ""APISH"" because it has S and H, which are common.

But we have no strong preference.

We can also consider ""ASKED"": has E? Forbidden.

""ALPHS"": not a common word.

I'll go with ""APHID"" for now.

But let's see: we have to make a guess.

We can also consider the frequency of letters.

Common letters left: S, L, I, P, M, D, etc.

We can try to cover more common ones.

""APHID"" has P, H, I, D.

""AMPLY"" has M, P, L, Y.

""APISH"" has P, I, S, H.

S is more common than D or Y, so ""APISH"" might be better.

Similarly, H is common.

So, let's choose ""APISH"".

But we must start with A, so ""APISH"": A (position 1), P (2), I (3), S (4), H (5).

We know A is correct in position 1, so we are testing P, I, S, H.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So, I'll go with ""apish"".

But let's write it.

Alternatively, we can use ""ASHAM"" but that has two A's? A in first and fourth? And S, H, M. But ""asham"" is not a word? I think ""asham"" is not standard. ""ASHAM"" might be a name, but not common.

""ASHEN"" has E.

So, ""APISH"" is valid.

Another common word: ""ASPIC"" but C is forbidden.

So, I think ""APISH"" is acceptable.

But let's confirm the word: ""apish"" is an adjective meaning ""foolishly silly"" or ""resembling an ape"".

In Wordle, it might be in the dictionary.

Similarly, ""APHID"" is a noun.

Both are valid.

I'll choose ""APISH"" to include S.

So, the guess is ""apish"".

But note: in the feedback, we will get:

- A: ✓ (since we know it's correct in position 1)
- P: ? 
- I: ?
- S: ?
- H: ?

And we'll see which are present and in what positions.

So, <guess>apish</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Eliminated letters C, R, N, E (all marked ""x""), and confirmed A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,assay,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the secret word)
R: x (not in the secret word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the secret word)
E: x (not in the secret word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word does not contain C, R, N, or E.
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A was the third letter and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).

Therefore, the secret word has the letter A, and it must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is already wrong).

We also know that the secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (to try to find its correct position) and
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word) and
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Let's think of words that have the letter A and other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like S, T, L, I, O, etc.).

We also note that the letter A cannot be in the third position (from the first guess), so we should try A in a different position.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

We might try to put A in the first position for the next guess to see if it's there.

But we also want to cover other common letters. Let's consider the word ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, we have only one A known so far.

Alternatively, we can try a word with A in the second position? Or fourth? 

Let me think of common words without C, R, N, E.

Some options:
- ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's? We don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have A in the second and fifth positions? But we don't know the frequency.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one A as present, but if the word had two A's, we would still only see one '-'? Actually, no. The feedback would show a '-' for every occurrence of A that is in the word but not in the correct position? But wait, if the word has two A's and we have one A in the guess, then we might only get one '-' and the other A might be in the correct position? But in our case, we only have one A in the guess and we got a '-', meaning there is at least one A in the word. There could be more.

But to be safe, we should avoid duplicate letters for now to get clearer information.

So, let's try a word with A and four new distinct letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, P, M, etc.

We can try ""SLATE"", but wait: E is in ""slate"" and we know E is not in the word (from first feedback). So we cannot use E.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, N, E.

So, we must avoid: C, R, N, E.

Let me try to form a word with A and without C, R, N, E.

Possible words: 
- ""PASTA"": has A twice and T, S, P. But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we are avoiding E? Yes, but ""pasta"" doesn't have E. However, it has two A's. We might get confused if the word has one A or two.

Alternatively, ""PLAIT"" -> but that has I and T, but we don't know. Also, it's less common.

Another idea: ""TALON"" -> but N is in it, and we know N is not in the word.

We must avoid N.

So, let's think of words without C, R, N, E and with A.

Common words: 
- ""SALAD"" -> has two A's and D, L, S. But two A's.
- ""ALIAS"" -> two A's and two S's? Not good for information.

We want a word with A and four other distinct letters that are not C, R, N, E.

How about ""AUDIO""? That has A, U, D, I, O. All distinct and none of the forbidden letters.

But is ""AUDIO"" a valid word? Yes, it is.

We can try ""AUDIO"". This way, we test A in the first position and also test U, D, I, O.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in the third position and it was present but wrong position. So if we put A in the first position, we might get:
- If A is in the first position in the secret word, then we get a check (✓) for A.
- If not, then we get a '-' again, meaning A is in the word but not in first position, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Also, we test four new letters: U, D, I, O.

So, let's go with ""AUDIO"".

But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? We are avoiding that for now to get clear feedback.

Alternatively, we can try ""PAINT"" but that has N and T? N is forbidden. So no.

Another word: ""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. This avoids C, R, N, E. And all distinct.

But we have A in the second position? We can try that.

We can also try ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P. Avoids C, R, N, E. And distinct letters.

But note: we don't know if S, T, M, P are in the word. So either ""AUDIO"" or ""STAMP"" or ""MAILS"".

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because it has vowels and we can get information about which vowels are present.

But the secret word might not have U, D, I, O. We don't know.

Alternatively, ""STAMP"" has more common consonants.

Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

Common consonants: S, T, L, P, M, etc.
Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. But we know E is out, so we can try I and O.

But we already know A is in, so we need to find consonants.

I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because:
- S and T are very common.
- We put A in the third position? But wait, in the first guess, A was in the third position and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not in third. So if we put A in the third position again, we will get a '-' again? Because it's the same wrong position? Actually, we know it's not in third, so we should avoid putting A in third.

In ""STAMP"", A is in the third position. But we already know that A is not in the third position (from first guess). So if we put A in the third again, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't give us new information about the position of A. We want to test a new position.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.

In ""AUDIO"", A is in the first position -> new position.
In ""MAILS"", A is in the second position -> new position.
In ""STAMP"", A is in the third -> same as before, so avoid.

So, let's choose between ""AUDIO"" and ""MAILS"".

We can also consider ""PLAIT"" but that has T and I, and A in third? Again, third position for A is bad.

Another word: ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden.

""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y. Avoids C, R, N, E. And A in second position.

So, ""DAILY"" is an option.

But let's go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests four vowels and we know the word has at least one vowel (A) and we can check for others.

But note: the word might have more vowels or consonants.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has A and common consonants.

I think ""MAILS"" is a good choice: M, A, I, L, S. A in second position.

Similarly, ""DAILY"" is also good.

But let me see: we have to avoid the letters we know are not present: C, R, N, E.

So, I'll choose ""MAILS"".

But wait, in ""MAILS"", we have A in the second position. We hope to get information about whether A is in the second position or not.

If we get a check for A, then we know it's in second. If we get a '-', then we know A is not in second, so it must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Also, we test M, I, L, S.

So, let's go with ""MAILS"".

But note: the word ""MAILS"" is valid.

Alternatively, ""SALAD"" is also valid but has duplicate A.

I think ""MAILS"" is better.

Another common word: ""PLAIT"" but A is in third? We avoid third.

""TOPAZ"": T, O, P, A, Z -> A in fourth position. That's good. And distinct letters.

But Z is less common.

""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. Avoids C, R, N, E.

""ABOUT"" is a good candidate.

But we have two options: ""ABOUT"" (A in first) and ""MAILS"" (A in second).

I think both are fine. Let me pick ""ABOUT"" because it has more common letters? Or ""MAILS""?

We can also consider ""ADIEU"", but E is forbidden? ""ADIEU"" has E, which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

So, ""ABOUT"" is okay.

But let's decide: I'll go with ""ABOUT"" because it tests A in the first position and B, O, U, T.

So, our second guess: ""ABOUT""

But note: we are not sure if the word has B, O, U, T. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can use ""STOMP"" but that doesn't have A? We must include A because we know it's in the word. Otherwise, we won't get information about A.

So, we must include A in the guess.

Therefore, we choose a word that includes A and four new letters.

So, ""ABOUT"" is a valid choice.

Let me write it: A in first, B in second, O in third, U in fourth, T in fifth.

We'll see the feedback.

So, the guess is ""about"".

But note: the word ""about"" is 5 letters and valid.

So, I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with ""-"").

Key insights:
- The secret word contains the letter A, which must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect).
- Avoid using C, R, N, E in future guesses.
- For the second guess, prioritize a word that:
  - Includes A in a new position (not position 3) to test its location.
  - Uses common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, B, U) to maximize information.
  - Avoids duplicate letters for clearer feedback.

After evaluating options like ""audio"" (A in position 1), ""mails"" (A in position 2), and ""about"" (A in position 1), ""about"" was selected because:
- It tests A in position 1 (a new position to verify).
- It introduces four new common letters (B, O, U, T) not yet tested.
- All letters are distinct, simplifying feedback interpretation.

<guess>about</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""about""
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 1)
- B: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- U: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)

Now, combining the information:

1. The secret word has the letter 'A' in the first position (from guess 2: A is correct and in position 1).
2. Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T (from both guesses, all marked with x).
3. We know the word starts with 'A'.

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with 'A'
- Does not contain: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T
- And from the first guess, we know that the word has an 'A' but not in position 3. However, now we know that 'A' is in position 1, so that condition is satisfied.

Since we have the first letter fixed as 'A', we need to guess the remaining four letters.

We have eliminated many common letters. The available letters are the remaining consonants and vowels that haven't been tried.

Available letters (from the alphabet, excluding the known absent ones: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U).

So, absent letters: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to form a word starting with 'A' and using only the available letters.

Common words starting with 'A' without the forbidden letters:

- ""APPLE"": but has P and L, but also E? E is forbidden. So no.
- ""ANGRY"": has N and R? Both forbidden. No.
- ""ALIEN"": has E and N? Forbidden. No.
- ""ADIEU"": has E and U? Forbidden. No.

Let's think of words starting with 'A' and using only D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:

- ""ALPHA"": A, L, P, H, A -> but has two A's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have A in first, so the last A would be in position 5. But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, we can try.

But let's check the letters: A (first), L, P, H, A (fifth). The available letters are fine (L, P, H are available). But we have two A's. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. So it's acceptable.

But we might get ambiguous feedback if there is only one A? Actually, since the first A is correct, the last A might be marked as absent if not in the word, or present if it is.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate A to avoid confusion.

Other words:

- ""AMPLY"": A, M, P, L, Y -> all letters available. And distinct except? All distinct: A, M, P, L, Y.

""AMPLY"" is a word meaning ""in an ample manner"".

- ""APPLY"": but has P, P, L, Y? And A. But two P's? And E? No, ""apply"" is A, P, P, L, Y. But we have two P's. Also, no E. But we don't know about duplicates. And P is available.

But ""apply"" has two P's, which might complicate.

- ""ALLY"": only 4 letters? No, we need 5.

5-letter words:

- ""ALIGN"": has G and N? N is forbidden. No.
- ""ALIKE"": has E? Forbidden. No.
- ""ALIVE"": has E? Forbidden. No.
- ""ALOUD"": has O and U? Forbidden. No.
- ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> but T is forbidden (from guess 2: T is x). So no.

T is forbidden? From guess 2, T is marked x, so not in the word.

Similarly, O, U, B are forbidden.

So, in ""AMPLY"": A, M, P, L, Y. Check forbidden: M, P, L, Y are not in the forbidden list. And T is not in it. So okay.

But we must avoid T? Yes, T is forbidden.

Another word: ""APHID"": A, P, H, I, D. All available letters: P, H, I, D. And distinct.

""Aphid"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""AVOID"": has O? Forbidden. No.

""AXIAL"": has X, I, A, L. But two A's? And X and I and L are available. But we have A in first and fifth. So duplicate A.

""AMISS"": A, M, I, S, S. Two S's? And M, I, S available.

But duplicate S.

To maximize information, we should prefer words with distinct letters.

So, ""APHID"" has distinct letters: A, P, H, I, D.

""AMPLY"" has distinct letters: A, M, P, L, Y.

Both are good.

We can also consider ""ASKEW"": A, S, K, E, W -> but E is forbidden. No.

""AZURE"": has U and E? Forbidden. No.

""ANVIL"": has N? Forbidden. No.

So, let's choose between ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"".

We might also consider ""ALPHA"" but it has two A's.

Another one: ""ADAPT"": has D, A, P, T -> T is forbidden. No.

""AGILE"": has E? Forbidden. No.

""ALGAE"": has E? Forbidden. No.

""ALMOND"": 6 letters? No.

So, 5-letter words: ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"" are candidates.

We can also consider ""WALTZ"": but doesn't start with A? We need to start with A.

We must start with A.

Another word: ""AWAIT"": has W, A, I, T -> but T is forbidden. And two A's? A in first and third? But T is forbidden.

""AVAIL"": has V, A, I, L -> and two A's? A in first and third? But we have A in first, so the third A might be duplicate. And V, I, L are available.

But duplicate A.

Similarly, ""AORTA"": has O? Forbidden.

So, back to ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"".

We can also consider ""ASHEN"": has E? Forbidden.

""ASPEN"": has E? Forbidden.

""AXIOM"": has O? Forbidden.

""AZOIC"": has O and I? O forbidden.

""ABYSS"": has B and Y, S, S? B forbidden.

So, I think ""APHID"" or ""AMPLY"" are good.

Let's pick ""AMPLY"" because it has more common letters? M, P, L, Y.

But Y is less common at the end? But it's acceptable.

We can also consider ""AMBER"": has B and E? Forbidden.

So, I'll go with ""AMPLY"".

But let's confirm: 
- A: we know is correct in position 1, so we expect a check for A.
- Then we test M in position 2, P in position 3, L in position 4, Y in position 5.

If any of these are in the word, we get feedback.

We might also get information about duplicate A? But since we don't have another A, we won't.

So, guess: ""AMPLY""

But note: we have to output in the required format.

Alternatively, we can think of other words.

Another word: ""AVID"": only 4 letters.

""APISH"": A, P, I, S, H. All distinct and available: P, I, S, H.

""APISH"" is a word (meaning resembling an ape).

Similarly, ""APHID"" and ""APISH"" are both good.

""AMPLY"" is also good.

I think any of these are fine. Let's choose ""APISH"" because it has S and H, which are common.

But we have no strong preference.

We can also consider ""ASKED"": has E? Forbidden.

""ALPHS"": not a common word.

I'll go with ""APHID"" for now.

But let's see: we have to make a guess.

We can also consider the frequency of letters.

Common letters left: S, L, I, P, M, D, etc.

We can try to cover more common ones.

""APHID"" has P, H, I, D.

""AMPLY"" has M, P, L, Y.

""APISH"" has P, I, S, H.

S is more common than D or Y, so ""APISH"" might be better.

Similarly, H is common.

So, let's choose ""APISH"".

But we must start with A, so ""APISH"": A (position 1), P (2), I (3), S (4), H (5).

We know A is correct in position 1, so we are testing P, I, S, H.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So, I'll go with ""apish"".

But let's write it.

Alternatively, we can use ""ASHAM"" but that has two A's? A in first and fourth? And S, H, M. But ""asham"" is not a word? I think ""asham"" is not standard. ""ASHAM"" might be a name, but not common.

""ASHEN"" has E.

So, ""APISH"" is valid.

Another common word: ""ASPIC"" but C is forbidden.

So, I think ""APISH"" is acceptable.

But let's confirm the word: ""apish"" is an adjective meaning ""foolishly silly"" or ""resembling an ape"".

In Wordle, it might be in the dictionary.

Similarly, ""APHID"" is a noun.

Both are valid.

I'll choose ""APISH"" to include S.

So, the guess is ""apish"".

But note: in the feedback, we will get:

- A: ✓ (since we know it's correct in position 1)
- P: ? 
- I: ?
- S: ?
- H: ?

And we'll see which are present and in what positions.

So, <guess>apish</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Eliminated letters C, R, N, E (all marked ""x""), and confirmed A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- **Guess 2 (""about"")**: Confirmed A is in position 1 (marked ""✓""), and eliminated B, O, U, T (all marked ""x"").

### Current Knowledge:
- **Correct position**: A is the first letter (position 1).
- **Eliminated letters**: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U (cannot appear in the word).
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Word structure**: Starts with A, followed by four letters from the available set. The word must be a valid English word.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize words starting with A and using common unused letters (e.g., S, L, I, P, M, H) to maximize information.
- Avoid eliminated letters and duplicate letters for clearer feedback.
- Test potential letters in new positions to narrow down possibilities.

Selected guess: **""APISH""** (meaning ""foolishly silly"" or ""resembling an ape"").  
- Why ""APISH""?  
  - Starts with A (confirmed position 1).  
  - Uses distinct, common available letters: P (position 2), I (position 3), S (position 4), H (position 5).  
  - Tests high-frequency consonants (S, P, H) and a vowel (I), which could reveal more about the word's structure.  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and duplicates.  

This guess will provide feedback on P, I, S, and H, helping to identify correct letters and their positions for the next guess.

We should choose a word that:\n- Includes the letter A (to try to find its correct position) and\n- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word) and\n- Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have the letter A and other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet (like S, T, L, I, O, etc.).\n\nWe also note that the letter A cannot be in the third position (from the first guess), so we should try A in a different position.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\nWe might try to put A in the first position for the next guess to see if it\'s there.\n\nBut we also want to cover other common letters. Let\'s consider the word ""SALAD"", but that has two A\'s and we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, we have only one A known so far.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with A in the second position? Or fourth? \n\nLet me think of common words without C, R, N, E.\n\nSome options:\n- ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> but two A\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we have A in the second and fifth positions? But we don\'t know the frequency.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one A as present, but if the word had two A\'s, we would still only see one \'-\'? Actually, no. The feedback would show a \'-\' for every occurrence of A that is in the word but not in the correct position? But wait, if the word has two A\'s and we have one A in the guess, then we might only get one \'-\' and the other A might be in the correct position? But in our case, we only have one A in the guess and we got a \'-\', meaning there is at least one A in the word. There could be more.\n\nBut to be safe, we should avoid duplicate letters for now to get clearer information.\n\nSo, let\'s try a word with A and four new distinct letters.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, P, M, etc.\n\nWe can try ""SLATE"", but wait: E is in ""slate"" and we know E is not in the word (from first feedback). So we cannot use E.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use C, R, N, E.\n\nSo, we must avoid: C, R, N, E.\n\nLet me try to form a word with A and without C, R, N, E.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""PASTA"": has A twice and T, S, P. But we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we are avoiding E? Yes, but ""pasta"" doesn\'t have E. However, it has two A\'s. We might get confused if the word has one A or two.\n\nAlternatively, ""PLAIT"" -> but that has I and T, but we don\'t know. Also, it\'s less common.\n\nAnother idea: ""TALON"" -> but N is in it, and we know N is not in the word.\n\nWe must avoid N.\n\nSo, let\'s think of words without C, R, N, E and with A.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""SALAD"" -> has two A\'s and D, L, S. But two A\'s.\n- ""ALIAS"" -> two A\'s and two S\'s? Not good for information.\n\nWe want a word with A and four other distinct letters that are not C, R, N, E.\n\nHow about ""AUDIO""? That has A, U, D, I, O. All distinct and none of the forbidden letters.\n\nBut is ""AUDIO"" a valid word? Yes, it is.\n\nWe can try ""AUDIO"". This way, we test A in the first position and also test U, D, I, O.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A in the third position and it was present but wrong position. So if we put A in the first position, we might get:\n- If A is in the first position in the secret word, then we get a check (✓) for A.\n- If not, then we get a \'-\' again, meaning A is in the word but not in first position, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nAlso, we test four new letters: U, D, I, O.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""AUDIO"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? We are avoiding that for now to get clear feedback.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""PAINT"" but that has N and T? N is forbidden. So no.\n\nAnother word: ""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. This avoids C, R, N, E. And all distinct.\n\nBut we have A in the second position? We can try that.\n\nWe can also try ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P. Avoids C, R, N, E. And distinct letters.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if S, T, M, P are in the word. So either ""AUDIO"" or ""STAMP"" or ""MAILS"".\n\nI think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because it has vowels and we can get information about which vowels are present.\n\nBut the secret word might not have U, D, I, O. We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, ""STAMP"" has more common consonants.\n\nLet me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, P, M, etc.\nCommon vowels: A, E, I, O, U. But we know E is out, so we can try I and O.\n\nBut we already know A is in, so we need to find consonants.\n\nI think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because:\n- S and T are very common.\n- We put A in the third position? But wait, in the first guess, A was in the third position and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not in third. So if we put A in the third position again, we will get a \'-\' again? Because it\'s the same wrong position? Actually, we know it\'s not in third, so we should avoid putting A in third.\n\nIn ""STAMP"", A is in the third position. But we already know that A is not in the third position (from first guess). So if we put A in the third again, we will get a \'-\' again, which doesn\'t give us new information about the position of A. We want to test a new position.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.\n\nIn ""AUDIO"", A is in the first position -> new position.\nIn ""MAILS"", A is in the second position -> new position.\nIn ""STAMP"", A is in the third -> same as before, so avoid.\n\nSo, let\'s choose between ""AUDIO"" and ""MAILS"".\n\nWe can also consider ""PLAIT"" but that has T and I, and A in third? Again, third position for A is bad.\n\nAnother word: ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden.\n\n""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y. Avoids C, R, N, E. And A in second position.\n\nSo, ""DAILY"" is an option.\n\nBut let\'s go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests four vowels and we know the word has at least one vowel (A) and we can check for others.\n\nBut note: the word might have more vowels or consonants.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has A and common consonants.\n\nI think ""MAILS"" is a good choice: M, A, I, L, S. A in second position.\n\nSimilarly, ""DAILY"" is also good.\n\nBut let me see: we have to avoid the letters we know are not present: C, R, N, E.\n\nSo, I\'ll choose ""MAILS"".\n\nBut wait, in ""MAILS"", we have A in the second position. We hope to get information about whether A is in the second position or not.\n\nIf we get a check for A, then we know it\'s in second. If we get a \'-\', then we know A is not in second, so it must be in 1, 4, or 5.\n\nAlso, we test M, I, L, S.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""MAILS"".\n\nBut note: the word ""MAILS"" is valid.\n\nAlternatively, ""SALAD"" is also valid but has duplicate A.\n\nI think ""MAILS"" is better.\n\nAnother common word: ""PLAIT"" but A is in third? We avoid third.\n\n""TOPAZ"": T, O, P, A, Z -> A in fourth position. That\'s good. And distinct letters.\n\nBut Z is less common.\n\n""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. Avoids C, R, N, E.\n\n""ABOUT"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut we have two options: ""ABOUT"" (A in first) and ""MAILS"" (A in second).\n\nI think both are fine. Let me pick ""ABOUT"" because it has more common letters? Or ""MAILS""?\n\nWe can also consider ""ADIEU"", but E is forbidden? ""ADIEU"" has E, which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n\nSo, ""ABOUT"" is okay.\n\nBut let\'s decide: I\'ll go with ""ABOUT"" because it tests A in the first position and B, O, U, T.\n\nSo, our second guess: ""ABOUT""\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has B, O, U, T. We are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""STOMP"" but that doesn\'t have A? We must include A because we know it\'s in the word. Otherwise, we won\'t get information about A.\n\nSo, we must include A in the guess.\n\nTherefore, we choose a word that includes A and four new letters.\n\nSo, ""ABOUT"" is a valid choice.\n\nLet me write it: A in first, B in second, O in third, U in fourth, T in fifth.\n\nWe\'ll see the feedback.\n\nSo, the guess is ""about"".\n\nBut note: the word ""about"" is 5 letters and valid.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with ""-"").\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word contains the letter A, which must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect).\n- Avoid using C, R, N, E in future guesses.\n- For the second guess, prioritize a word that:\n  - Includes A in a new position (not position 3) to test its location.\n  - Uses common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, B, U) to maximize information.\n  - Avoids duplicate letters for clearer feedback.\n\nAfter evaluating options like ""audio"" (A in position 1), ""mails"" (A in position 2), and ""about"" (A in position 1), ""about"" was selected because:\n- It tests A in position 1 (a new position to verify).\n- It introduces four new common letters (B, O, U, T) not yet tested.\n- All letters are distinct, simplifying feedback interpretation.\n\n<guess>about</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""about""\n- A: ✓ (correct, in position 1)\n- B: x (not in the word)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n- U: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n\nNow, combining the information:\n\n1. The secret word has the letter \'A\' in the first position (from guess 2: A is correct and in position 1).\n2. Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T (from both guesses, all marked with x).\n3. We know the word starts with \'A\'.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that:\n- Starts with \'A\'\n- Does not contain: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T\n- And from the first guess, we know that the word has an \'A\' but not in position 3. However, now we know that \'A\' is in position 1, so that condition is satisfied.\n\nSince we have the first letter fixed as \'A\', we need to guess the remaining four letters.\n\nWe have eliminated many common letters. The available letters are the remaining consonants and vowels that haven\'t been tried.\n\nAvailable letters (from the alphabet, excluding the known absent ones: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U).\n\nSo, absent letters: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U.\n\nAvailable letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWe need to form a word starting with \'A\' and using only the available letters.\n\nCommon words starting with \'A\' without the forbidden letters:\n\n- ""APPLE"": but has P and L, but also E? E is forbidden. So no.\n- ""ANGRY"": has N and R? Both forbidden. No.\n- ""ALIEN"": has E and N? Forbidden. No.\n- ""ADIEU"": has E and U? Forbidden. No.\n\nLet\'s think of words starting with \'A\' and using only D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""ALPHA"": A, L, P, H, A -> but has two A\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have A in first, so the last A would be in position 5. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. However, we can try.\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: A (first), L, P, H, A (fifth). The available letters are fine (L, P, H are available). But we have two A\'s. We know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. So it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we might get ambiguous feedback if there is only one A? Actually, since the first A is correct, the last A might be marked as absent if not in the word, or present if it is.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without duplicate A to avoid confusion.\n\nOther words:\n\n- ""AMPLY"": A, M, P, L, Y -> all letters available. And distinct except? All distinct: A, M, P, L, Y.\n\n""AMPLY"" is a word meaning ""in an ample manner"".\n\n- ""APPLY"": but has P, P, L, Y? And A. But two P\'s? And E? No, ""apply"" is A, P, P, L, Y. But we have two P\'s. Also, no E. But we don\'t know about duplicates. And P is available.\n\nBut ""apply"" has two P\'s, which might complicate.\n\n- ""ALLY"": only 4 letters? No, we need 5.\n\n5-letter words:\n\n- ""ALIGN"": has G and N? N is forbidden. No.\n- ""ALIKE"": has E? Forbidden. No.\n- ""ALIVE"": has E? Forbidden. No.\n- ""ALOUD"": has O and U? Forbidden. No.\n- ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> but T is forbidden (from guess 2: T is x). So no.\n\nT is forbidden? From guess 2, T is marked x, so not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, O, U, B are forbidden.\n\nSo, in ""AMPLY"": A, M, P, L, Y. Check forbidden: M, P, L, Y are not in the forbidden list. And T is not in it. So okay.\n\nBut we must avoid T? Yes, T is forbidden.\n\nAnother word: ""APHID"": A, P, H, I, D. All available letters: P, H, I, D. And distinct.\n\n""Aphid"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""AVOID"": has O? Forbidden. No.\n\n""AXIAL"": has X, I, A, L. But two A\'s? And X and I and L are available. But we have A in first and fifth. So duplicate A.\n\n""AMISS"": A, M, I, S, S. Two S\'s? And M, I, S available.\n\nBut duplicate S.\n\nTo maximize information, we should prefer words with distinct letters.\n\nSo, ""APHID"" has distinct letters: A, P, H, I, D.\n\n""AMPLY"" has distinct letters: A, M, P, L, Y.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nWe can also consider ""ASKEW"": A, S, K, E, W -> but E is forbidden. No.\n\n""AZURE"": has U and E? Forbidden. No.\n\n""ANVIL"": has N? Forbidden. No.\n\nSo, let\'s choose between ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"".\n\nWe might also consider ""ALPHA"" but it has two A\'s.\n\nAnother one: ""ADAPT"": has D, A, P, T -> T is forbidden. No.\n\n""AGILE"": has E? Forbidden. No.\n\n""ALGAE"": has E? Forbidden. No.\n\n""ALMOND"": 6 letters? No.\n\nSo, 5-letter words: ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"" are candidates.\n\nWe can also consider ""WALTZ"": but doesn\'t start with A? We need to start with A.\n\nWe must start with A.\n\nAnother word: ""AWAIT"": has W, A, I, T -> but T is forbidden. And two A\'s? A in first and third? But T is forbidden.\n\n""AVAIL"": has V, A, I, L -> and two A\'s? A in first and third? But we have A in first, so the third A might be duplicate. And V, I, L are available.\n\nBut duplicate A.\n\nSimilarly, ""AORTA"": has O? Forbidden.\n\nSo, back to ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"".\n\nWe can also consider ""ASHEN"": has E? Forbidden.\n\n""ASPEN"": has E? Forbidden.\n\n""AXIOM"": has O? Forbidden.\n\n""AZOIC"": has O and I? O forbidden.\n\n""ABYSS"": has B and Y, S, S? B forbidden.\n\nSo, I think ""APHID"" or ""AMPLY"" are good.\n\nLet\'s pick ""AMPLY"" because it has more common letters? M, P, L, Y.\n\nBut Y is less common at the end? But it\'s acceptable.\n\nWe can also consider ""AMBER"": has B and E? Forbidden.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""AMPLY"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: \n- A: we know is correct in position 1, so we expect a check for A.\n- Then we test M in position 2, P in position 3, L in position 4, Y in position 5.\n\nIf any of these are in the word, we get feedback.\n\nWe might also get information about duplicate A? But since we don\'t have another A, we won\'t.\n\nSo, guess: ""AMPLY""\n\nBut note: we have to output in the required format.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of other words.\n\nAnother word: ""AVID"": only 4 letters.\n\n""APISH"": A, P, I, S, H. All distinct and available: P, I, S, H.\n\n""APISH"" is a word (meaning resembling an ape).\n\nSimilarly, ""APHID"" and ""APISH"" are both good.\n\n""AMPLY"" is also good.\n\nI think any of these are fine. Let\'s choose ""APISH"" because it has S and H, which are common.\n\nBut we have no strong preference.\n\nWe can also consider ""ASKED"": has E? Forbidden.\n\n""ALPHS"": not a common word.\n\nI\'ll go with ""APHID"" for now.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have to make a guess.\n\nWe can also consider the frequency of letters.\n\nCommon letters left: S, L, I, P, M, D, etc.\n\nWe can try to cover more common ones.\n\n""APHID"" has P, H, I, D.\n\n""AMPLY"" has M, P, L, Y.\n\n""APISH"" has P, I, S, H.\n\nS is more common than D or Y, so ""APISH"" might be better.\n\nSimilarly, H is common.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""APISH"".\n\nBut we must start with A, so ""APISH"": A (position 1), P (2), I (3), S (4), H (5).\n\nWe know A is correct in position 1, so we are testing P, I, S, H.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""apish"".\n\nBut let\'s write it.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""ASHAM"" but that has two A\'s? A in first and fourth? And S, H, M. But ""asham"" is not a word? I think ""asham"" is not standard. ""ASHAM"" might be a name, but not common.\n\n""ASHEN"" has E.\n\nSo, ""APISH"" is valid.\n\nAnother common word: ""ASPIC"" but C is forbidden.\n\nSo, I think ""APISH"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the word: ""apish"" is an adjective meaning ""foolishly silly"" or ""resembling an ape"".\n\nIn Wordle, it might be in the dictionary.\n\nSimilarly, ""APHID"" is a noun.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI\'ll choose ""APISH"" to include S.\n\nSo, the guess is ""apish"".\n\nBut note: in the feedback, we will get:\n\n- A: ✓ (since we know it\'s correct in position 1)\n- P: ? \n- I: ?\n- S: ?\n- H: ?\n\nAnd we\'ll see which are present and in what positions.\n\nSo, <guess>apish</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Eliminated letters C, R, N, E (all marked ""x""), and confirmed A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").\n- **Guess 2 (""about"")**: Confirmed A is in position 1 (marked ""✓""), and eliminated B, O, U, T (all marked ""x"").\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Correct position**: A is the first letter (position 1).\n- **Eliminated letters**: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U (cannot appear in the word).\n- **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- **Word structure**: Starts with A, followed by four letters from the available set. The word must be a valid English word.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Prioritize words starting with A and using common unused letters (e.g., S, L, I, P, M, H) to maximize information.\n- Avoid eliminated letters and duplicate letters for clearer feedback.\n- Test potential letters in new positions to narrow down possibilities.\n\nSelected guess: **""APISH""** (meaning ""foolishly silly"" or ""resembling an ape"").  \n- Why ""APISH""?  \n  - Starts with A (confirmed position 1).  \n  - Uses distinct, common available letters: P (position 2), I (position 3), S (position 4), H (position 5).  \n  - Tests high-frequency consonants (S, P, H) and a vowel (I), which could reveal more about the word\'s structure.  \n  - Avoids eliminated letters and duplicates.  \n\nThis guess will provide feedback on P, I, S, and H, helping to identify correct letters and their positions for the next guess.\n\n<guess>apish</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: apish -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) P(x) I(x) S(-) H(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; specifically, not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""about""
- A: ✓ (correct, position 1)
- B: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- U: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""apish""
- A: ✓ (correct, position 1)
- P: x (not in word)
- I: x (not in word)
- S: - (in word, wrong position; not position 4)
- H: x (not in word)

Now, combining all information:

1. The word starts with A (position 1 is fixed as A).
2. Letters not in the word (eliminated): B, C, E, I, N, O, P, R, T, U, H.
   - From guess 1: C, R, N, E
   - From guess 2: B, O, U, T
   - From guess 3: P, I, H
   - So eliminated: B,C,E,H,I,N,O,P,R,T,U.

3. Letters that are in the word:
   - A is in the word and fixed at position 1.
   - From guess 3, S is in the word (since we got a '-') but not in position 4.
   - Additionally, from guess 1, A was marked as present but not in position 3. But now that position 1 is A, that is consistent.

We know the word must have S, and it cannot be in position 4 (from guess 3), and cannot be in position 1 (since position 1 is A). So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Also, we have eliminated many letters, so what's left?

Available letters: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But S is already known to be in the word. So the word has at least two letters: A and S.

The word has positions: 
Position 1: A
Position 2: ? (cannot be S if S is not in position 4, but S could be here? Wait, no restriction yet except the eliminated letters)
Actually, S can be in position 2, since we put S in position 4 and got '-', meaning S is in the word but not in 4. It could be in 2, 3, or 5.

We don't know if there are other letters.

The word might have more than two unique letters? But we only know A and S for sure.

Now, we need to form a word that starts with A, includes S (in one of positions 2,3,5) and uses only available letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,S,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Also, we must avoid the eliminated letters.

For the next guess, we should:
1. Keep A in position 1 (since it's correct).
2. Include S in a new position to test: either 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 was wrong).
   - We should try to place S in one of these positions to see if it fits.
3. Fill the remaining positions with new common letters from the available set.

We have three possibilities for S: positions 2, 3, or 5.

We can prioritize testing S in position 2, for example.

To maximize information, we can choose a word with S in position 2 and distinct new letters.

Available common letters: L, M, D, F, G, K, etc.

Note: We have only 6 tries, and this is our fourth guess.

What words start with A and have S in the second position?

If S is in position 2: A S _ _ _

Possible words: 
- ""ASKEW"": but has E, which is eliminated? Yes, E is not allowed.
- ""ASPIC"": has C? Eliminated.
- ""ASSAY"": but has S twice? And A? We have A already in position 1, so if we put S in position 2, then S again in position 3? But we don't know if S appears multiple times. Also, 'A' in position 5? But we have A fixed at position 1, and we don't know about duplicate A. However, ""assay"" has S and S, and A at the end? But position 1 is A, and if the word ends with A, that's possible? But in our feedback, when we had ""crane"", we had A as '-' meaning present but not position 3. And with ""apish"", we didn't have another A. So it's possible.

But to avoid complexity, we should test words without duplicates first.

Another word: ""ASHED"": has E? Eliminated.

""ASKED"": has E and K? But E eliminated.

So no.

What about S in position 3: A _ S _ _

Possible words:
- ""AEGIS"": has E? Eliminated.
- ""ALIAS"": has L, I? I eliminated (from guess 3). Also, I is not allowed.
- ""ABBAS"": has B? Eliminated.

Without eliminated letters:

Available: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,S,V,W,X,Y,Z

So, ""A?S??"" with ? from available.

For example:
- ""AMASS"": A, M, A, S, S? But we have two A's? Position 1 is A, then position 3 is S? Position 5 is S? And M at position 2? Then position 4 is S? Actually, ""AMASS"" is A (1), M (2), A (3), S (4). But position 3 is A? We don't know if A is duplicated. Also, position 4 is S? But in guess 3, S was not in position 4 because we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there. So S wouldn't be correct in position 4? Same reason? In guess 3, S was in position 4 and got '-', so S is not in position 4. Therefore, we cannot put S in position 4 again? We shouldn't.

In our next guess, if we put S in position 4, we expect a '-' again (if it's not correct, but we know it's not) so it doesn't help. So we should avoid position 4 for S.

So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Trying to form words with S in position 2: 
- Must be ""A S ? ? ?""
Letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (since S is used at position 2).

And the word must have only one S? Not necessarily, but to avoid duplicates, we try one S.

So, ""AS..."" words without eliminated letters.

Possible:
- ""ASKEW"" no, E.
- ""ASDIC"": has D, I? I eliminated? Wait, I is eliminated? From guess 3, I is marked x, so yes, not allowed.
""ASDIC"": A,S,D,I,C? But C and I eliminated? And C is eliminated too? So no.

Another: ""ASWAY"" ? Not common.

""ASKOI"": has O and I? Both eliminated? No.

""ASKED"" no E.

Perhaps no common words with S in position 2 without using eliminated letters.

Similarly, for S in position 3: ""A ? S ? ?""

Possible:
- ""AULOS"": has O and U? Eliminated.
- ""AXIOM"": has O? Eliminated.
- ""ADSES"": not a word.

Without eliminated letters.

For example: ""A G S V D"" ? Not a word.

Common words: 
- ""AGISM"": not common? Also, has I? Eliminated.
- ""ALMES"": has E? Eliminated.

It's difficult.

S in position 5: ""A ? ? ? S""

So positions: 1: A, 5: S.

And 2,3,4 from available letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we exclude S for the middle positions? Or we can have S again? But let's try without duplicate first.

Possible words:
- ""ADVWS""? Not a word.
- ""AFARS"": but that's two S? ""afars"" is not common? ""AFARS"" might be a proper name? Not ideal.
- ""AGARS"": same.

Common words ending with S: 
- ""ALIAS"": but has I? Eliminated.
- ""AMASS"": we thought earlier, but has two S and two A? A at 1 and 3? S at 4 and 5? But we know S cannot be in 4? So in ""AMASS"", positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S? But position 4 is S, which we know is wrong because in guess 3 S was in position 4 and we got a '-', meaning it should not be in 4. So if we put S in 4 again, it will be '-'. Also, S in position 5 might be correct? However, ""AMASS"" has S in both 4 and 5? But if the word has two S, that's possible? And position 5 S might be correct? Position 1 A is correct. Position 3 A? We don't know.

But let's see: ""AMASS"" has letters M and A? And S.

But M is available? Yes.

Another word: ""AWAITS""? Too long.

5-letter: ""ASSES"": but starts with A, then S,S,E,S? But E eliminated. And two S.

""APSES"": has E? Eliminated.

""ALMES"": has E.

""ABYES"": has B and E? Eliminated.

""ACKES"": eliminated.

Hard to find a common word.

But we have ""DAILY"" but doesn't end with S? Not.

Another ending with S: ""ANODE"" eliminated.

Perhaps ""LYAMS""? Doesn't start with A.

We consider words with duplicate letters? Or use S only once.

List of words: 
- ""AZANS"": not common.

I think we have to consider S in the other positions.

Another option: S in position 3.

Try ""A_ S _ _"" 

With available letters: for position 2: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z
Position 4 and 5: same set.

Common words: 
- ""ALAS"": only 4 letters.
- ""ADSUM"": not 5.

""AGAST"": has G,A,S,T? But T is eliminated? T is marked x in guess 2.

""AGASP"": has G,A,S,P? But P eliminated? In guess 3, P is x.

P is eliminated.

So, no T, no P.

But what about L? ""ALSAK""? Not a word.

"" A L S D K""? No.

Perhaps ""K"" at the end? ""ALCKS""? No.

Think differently: include S in position 5, and use common letters for 2,3,4.

Available letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common combinations: use L, M, D.

For example: 
- ""ALLYS"": has L twice? And L and Y? But ""ALLY"" is 4, ""ALLYS"" might be a word? Or ""ALLOW"" but O and not S.
- ""ALMYS"" no.

""ASHED"" no E.

Perhaps ""AWFUL"" but no S.

We need to include S? Only at the end or at position 3.

Let's try a word with S in position 5: ""A _ _ _ S""

Common words: 
- ""ADIOS"": has D,I,O? O eliminated? O is from guess 2, eliminated. I eliminated.
- ""ADVWS"" no.

""AGERS"": has E? No.

""AGLOW"": no S.

""AKSES"": not common.

""ALMES"": has E.

It's tricky.

Focus on what other letters are likely.

Perhaps the word has L or M.

Another idea: in guess 1, we had A as present but not in 3. But now position 1 is A, so that condition is satisfied. And S is in the word, not in 4.

We also have few letters available.

Perhaps we missed a letter that is not eliminated? Like G, K, L, M, W, etc.

We can try to include such letters.

One word: ""AISLE"" but has I and E? Eliminated.

""ACIDS"" has C and I? Eliminated.

""ALIAS"" has I? Eliminated.

But we have to use only available letters.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words starting with A, with S in the word (not position 4), and using only D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z, and S must be in 2,3, or 5.

Assume S in position 5 for now.

Common words ending with S and starting with A, without eliminated letters:

- ""AKAAS"" ? Not common.
- ""ALGAS"": but has G, A, S? And L? Position 1: A,2: L,3: G,4: A,5: S? But we have A at 1 and 4? Duplicate A? And available letters: L,G,A are available? Except A is at 1, but A is in the set? Position 4 is A? We don't know. Also, ""ALGAS"" is a valid word (plural of alga?).

But sea plant? So it's a word.

But it has two A's: A at 1 and 4, and S at 5.

Also, letters L and G.

We can try ""ALGAS"".

Similarly, ""ARRAS"" has R? Eliminated.

""ALMAS"" has M? All available? ""ALMAS"": A (1), L (2), M (3), A (4), S (5)? Again, two A's.

Or ""ADVES"" not a word.

Another: ""AKSED"" has E.

I think ""ALGAS"" or ""ALMAS"" are options.

Similarly, ""AWOLS"" has O? Eliminated.

""AYESS"" not common.

Among ""ALGAS"" and ""ALMAS"", we can choose.

""ALGAS"" might be less common, but it's in dictionaries.

""ALMAS"" is a word in English? It can be plural of alma? alma mater, but not commonly used.

Perhaps ""ALGAE"" but has E.

Or ""AWDLS"" no.

Another common one: ""AWAYS"" has W and Y? But no S in position 5? ""AWAYS"" is A,W,A,Y,S? Position 5 S? S at 5. And letters W and Y available. But ""aways"" is an adverb? Not common in Wordle? But might be accepted.

But ""aways"" has two A's? A at 1 and 3.

Similarly, ""AWASH"" has S and H, but H is eliminated? From guess 3, H is x. So H not allowed.

In guess 3, H is x, so we cannot use H.

So for ""ALGAS"": G and L are available.

G has not been used.

Similarly, for position where S is at 5, we can try.

But to try to test S in position 2 or 3.

Another attempt: S in position 3.

Word: A ? S ? ?

Position 1: A, position 3: S.

Position 2,4,5: from available letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (no eliminated letters).

And S is at 3, so not duplicate unless we add more S, but we avoid.

Possible words:
- ""AXLES"": has X,L,E? E eliminated.
- ""AASKS"" duplicate A and S, not common.

""ABSORB"" too long.

"" A L S K S "" not a word.

Perhaps ""AL S + two letters"".

Like ""ALSO"" but 4 letters.

""ALSYN"" not a word.

"" ALSPH"" no.

It's very difficult to find.

Maybe ""AMASS"" but S in position 5? Then position 4 is S? But we know S can't be in position 4.

In ""AMASS"", position 4 is S, which we know is wrong, so it will not be check. But position 5 S might be correct.

But let's consider it: ""AMASS"" has positions:
1: A (correct)
2: M
3: A
4: S (we know not correct)
5: S

If the word is ""AMASS"", then in our feedback for position 4 S, we'd get a '-' because it's in the word but only one more position? But there is another S at position 5. The feedback would be:
- Position 4: if S is in the word but wrong position, we get '-', which is what we got in guess 3? But this is for a new guess.

But for now, we are guessing ""AMASS"", but we have to use only available letters.

M is available? Yes.

A is at position 1 and 3? Possible.

But let's use this as a guess.

We have other words like ""ASKED"" and ""ASHED"" but have eliminated letters.

Another word: ""ASHES"" has H and E? Eliminated.

I think we must use a word that may have duplicate letters or use common available letters.

Perhaps ""LAWNS"" doesn't start with A.

Let's try to search for words with available letters.

One word: ""AARGH"" has R and G? R eliminated.

""ABACS"" not common.

""ABAYA"" has B and Y? B eliminated.

It's very limited.

Perhaps we missed that some letters are not eliminated.

Eliminated letters are: B,C,E,H,I,N,O,P,R,T,U

From feedback:
- C, R, N, E from guess 1.
- B, O, U, T from guess 2.
- P, I, H from guess 3.

So total eliminated: B,C,E,H,I,N,O,P,R,T,U

Available: A is already at 1, S is in the word, and: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

Now, S must be in position 2,3, or 5.

For example, a word like ""A S K G D"" not a word.

""A G S D K"" not a word.

Common word: ""SALAD"" but that doesn't start with A? It does S A L A D? No, starts with S, but we need start with A? Oh.

Other common words starting with A: ""ANnEX"" eliminated.

Perhaps ""AGL"" ""agley"" not 5 letters.

""AMaZE"" has E.

I think we should consider ""ALGAS"" or ""ALMAS"".

""ALGA "" is 4 letters. Plural is ""ALGAE"" or ""ALGAS""? Some dictionaries accept ""algas"" as the plural of alga, especially in context.

Similarly, ""ALMAS"" might be accepted? Or ""ALMEH"" but has H? Eliminated.

Another word: ""FATAL"" doesn't start with A.

Perhaps ""AUDIO"" but we used about.

Let's choose ""ALGAS"" a ""algas"" is the plural form in some contexts.

Or ""AMASS"" is more common.

""AMASS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

In ""AMASS"", the S is in positions 4 and 5? We know position 4 is not correct, so we expect a '-' for position 4 S in feedback. Position 5 S might be correct.

But we can guess ""amass"" to test.

If the word is ""AMASS"", then:
- Position 1: A ✓
- Position 2: M ?
- Position 3: A ? (possibly duplicate)
- Position 4: S (should be '-')
- Position 5: S ( if this is the only correct S position, but in the word there are two S? Feedback might mark position 5 as 'S' if it's the only correct one? But the word has two S, so position 4 S might be marked as '-', and position 5 S as '✓' if it's correct.

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can use a word with S in position 5 and no other S.

For example, ""AWAKE"" has E? No.

""AWAVE"" not common.

""ASDIC"" has I? No.

I think ""ALGAS"" is a choice: ""ALGAS"" with positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:Gas? ""a-l-g-a-s"", so
pos1: A
pos2: L
pos3: G
pos4: A
pos5: S

So S in position 5.

This tests S at position 5.

And we test L and G.

Also, there is A at position 4, so we test if there is a second A.

Since we have feedback from guess 1 that A is in the word, but not position 3, and now at position 1, it is possible there is another A.

In guess 3, we had no other A, but that doesn't mean there isn't duplicate.

So  guess ""ALGAS"".

Other options: ""ADMAN"" has D and M and N? N eliminated? From guess 1, N is eliminated.

""ADZES"" has D,Z,E,S? E eliminated.

""AFARA"" not common.

""AG   a g a a s"" not.

I think we have to go with ""ALGAS"" or ""AMASS"".

But ""AMASS"" has S in position 4, which we know is wrong, so it will give a '-' for position 4 S, no new information.

Whereas ""ALGAS"" has S in position 5, which is a new position.

Also, if there is only one S in the word, then position 5 might be correct.

So for information, ""ALGAS"" is better because we are testing S in a new position (5).

Similarly, we can test L and G.

So let's choose ""ALGAS"".

But is it in the Wordle dictionary? It might be, as it's a valid if uncommon word.

Another common word: ""AXIAL"" but has X, I, A, L? but I eliminated? In guess 3, I is eliminated.

So ""AXIAL"" not allowed.

""AYahs"" not 5 letters.

So I think ""ALGAS"" is a possible guess.

Perhaps ""KALIM"" not start with A.

Or ""MALMS"" not.

So, we'll guess ""ALGAS"".

In this guess:
- A at 1: correct, so ✓
- L at 2: we will see if in word
- G at 3: see if in word
- A at 4: we will see if duplicate A is present
- S at 5: see if in word or correct position

Feedback will tell us.

So, <guess>algas</guess>

But let's output.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Thought Process

I have the feedback from three previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - This eliminates C, R, N, E and confirms A is in the word but not in position 3.
- **Guess 2 (""about"")**: A(✓), B(x), O(x), U(x), T(x)  
  - Confirms A is in position 1 and eliminates B, O, U, T.
- **Guess 3 (""apish"")**: A(✓), P(x), I(x), S(-), H(x)  
  - Confirms A in position 1 (redundant but reinforces), eliminates P, I, H, and confirms S is in the word but not in position 4.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Position 1 is fixed as A** (from Guess 2 ✓).
- **S must be in the word** and is not in position 4 (from Guess 3 -). Therefore, possible positions for S are 2, 3, or 5.
- **Eliminated letters (not in word)**: B, C, E, H, I, N, O, P, R, T, U (from all feedback).
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z (S is confirmed in the word).
- **Word structure**: Starts with A (position 1), and has S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5. The word may have duplicates, but we prioritize testing new positions and distinct letters for clarity.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Keep A in position 1** (fixed).
- **Test S in a new position** to narrow down its location. Since S is not allowed in position 4 and was tested there in Guess 3, we prioritize position 5 for this guess (positions 2 and 3 can be tested later if needed).
- **Fill remaining positions** with common unused available letters to maximize information (e.g., L, G for their frequency).
- Choose a **valid English word** from available letters that fits constraints.
- Avoid eliminated letters and minimize duplicates for clearer feedback (though duplicates may be necessary).

### Word Selection:
- Ideal candidate should: start with A, have S in position 5, and use available letters (e.g., L, G).
- **Evaluated options**:
  - ""ALGAS"": Valid 5-letter word meaning ""seaweeds"" (plural of alga). Structure: A (pos1), L (pos2), G (pos3), A (pos4), S (pos5).  
    - Tests S in position 5 (new position).
    - Tests L, G, and potential duplicate A (which is possible but not confirmed).
    - Uses distinct common letters L and G.
  - Alternatives like ""AMASS"" (A, M, A, S, S) were rejected because S is in position 4 (known incorrect, wasting a test), or ""ALIAS"" (has eliminated I).
- **Why ""ALGAS""?**  
  - Tests S in position 5, which could confirm if correct (✓) or rule it out (-/x).
  - Introduces new letters L and G.
  - If A in position 4 is correct (-/✓), it tells us about duplicates.
  - Balances common letters (L, G) and valid structure within constraints.

### Expected Feedback Insight:
The feedback will:
- Confirm position 1 A (✓).
- Reveal if S is in position 5 (✓/-/x) or wrong position (handling duplicates).
- Provide data on L (pos2) and G (pos3), helping reduce possibilities for Guess 5.
- Guide further guesses based on S’s position and new letter eliminations.

<guess>algas</guess>",algas,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; specifically, not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""about""
- A: ✓ (correct, position 1)
- B: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- U: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""apish""
- A: ✓ (correct, position 1)
- P: x (not in word)
- I: x (not in word)
- S: - (in word, wrong position; not position 4)
- H: x (not in word)

Now, combining all information:

1. The word starts with A (position 1 is fixed as A).
2. Letters not in the word (eliminated): B, C, E, I, N, O, P, R, T, U, H.
   - From guess 1: C, R, N, E
   - From guess 2: B, O, U, T
   - From guess 3: P, I, H
   - So eliminated: B,C,E,H,I,N,O,P,R,T,U.

3. Letters that are in the word:
   - A is in the word and fixed at position 1.
   - From guess 3, S is in the word (since we got a '-') but not in position 4.
   - Additionally, from guess 1, A was marked as present but not in position 3. But now that position 1 is A, that is consistent.

We know the word must have S, and it cannot be in position 4 (from guess 3), and cannot be in position 1 (since position 1 is A). So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Also, we have eliminated many letters, so what's left?

Available letters: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But S is already known to be in the word. So the word has at least two letters: A and S.

The word has positions: 
Position 1: A
Position 2: ? (cannot be S if S is not in position 4, but S could be here? Wait, no restriction yet except the eliminated letters)
Actually, S can be in position 2, since we put S in position 4 and got '-', meaning S is in the word but not in 4. It could be in 2, 3, or 5.

We don't know if there are other letters.

The word might have more than two unique letters? But we only know A and S for sure.

Now, we need to form a word that starts with A, includes S (in one of positions 2,3,5) and uses only available letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,S,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Also, we must avoid the eliminated letters.

For the next guess, we should:
1. Keep A in position 1 (since it's correct).
2. Include S in a new position to test: either 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 was wrong).
   - We should try to place S in one of these positions to see if it fits.
3. Fill the remaining positions with new common letters from the available set.

We have three possibilities for S: positions 2, 3, or 5.

We can prioritize testing S in position 2, for example.

To maximize information, we can choose a word with S in position 2 and distinct new letters.

Available common letters: L, M, D, F, G, K, etc.

Note: We have only 6 tries, and this is our fourth guess.

What words start with A and have S in the second position?

If S is in position 2: A S _ _ _

Possible words: 
- ""ASKEW"": but has E, which is eliminated? Yes, E is not allowed.
- ""ASPIC"": has C? Eliminated.
- ""ASSAY"": but has S twice? And A? We have A already in position 1, so if we put S in position 2, then S again in position 3? But we don't know if S appears multiple times. Also, 'A' in position 5? But we have A fixed at position 1, and we don't know about duplicate A. However, ""assay"" has S and S, and A at the end? But position 1 is A, and if the word ends with A, that's possible? But in our feedback, when we had ""crane"", we had A as '-' meaning present but not position 3. And with ""apish"", we didn't have another A. So it's possible.

But to avoid complexity, we should test words without duplicates first.

Another word: ""ASHED"": has E? Eliminated.

""ASKED"": has E and K? But E eliminated.

So no.

What about S in position 3: A _ S _ _

Possible words:
- ""AEGIS"": has E? Eliminated.
- ""ALIAS"": has L, I? I eliminated (from guess 3). Also, I is not allowed.
- ""ABBAS"": has B? Eliminated.

Without eliminated letters:

Available: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,S,V,W,X,Y,Z

So, ""A?S??"" with ? from available.

For example:
- ""AMASS"": A, M, A, S, S? But we have two A's? Position 1 is A, then position 3 is S? Position 5 is S? And M at position 2? Then position 4 is S? Actually, ""AMASS"" is A (1), M (2), A (3), S (4). But position 3 is A? We don't know if A is duplicated. Also, position 4 is S? But in guess 3, S was not in position 4 because we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there. So S wouldn't be correct in position 4? Same reason? In guess 3, S was in position 4 and got '-', so S is not in position 4. Therefore, we cannot put S in position 4 again? We shouldn't.

In our next guess, if we put S in position 4, we expect a '-' again (if it's not correct, but we know it's not) so it doesn't help. So we should avoid position 4 for S.

So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Trying to form words with S in position 2: 
- Must be ""A S ? ? ?""
Letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (since S is used at position 2).

And the word must have only one S? Not necessarily, but to avoid duplicates, we try one S.

So, ""AS..."" words without eliminated letters.

Possible:
- ""ASKEW"" no, E.
- ""ASDIC"": has D, I? I eliminated? Wait, I is eliminated? From guess 3, I is marked x, so yes, not allowed.
""ASDIC"": A,S,D,I,C? But C and I eliminated? And C is eliminated too? So no.

Another: ""ASWAY"" ? Not common.

""ASKOI"": has O and I? Both eliminated? No.

""ASKED"" no E.

Perhaps no common words with S in position 2 without using eliminated letters.

Similarly, for S in position 3: ""A ? S ? ?""

Possible:
- ""AULOS"": has O and U? Eliminated.
- ""AXIOM"": has O? Eliminated.
- ""ADSES"": not a word.

Without eliminated letters.

For example: ""A G S V D"" ? Not a word.

Common words: 
- ""AGISM"": not common? Also, has I? Eliminated.
- ""ALMES"": has E? Eliminated.

It's difficult.

S in position 5: ""A ? ? ? S""

So positions: 1: A, 5: S.

And 2,3,4 from available letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we exclude S for the middle positions? Or we can have S again? But let's try without duplicate first.

Possible words:
- ""ADVWS""? Not a word.
- ""AFARS"": but that's two S? ""afars"" is not common? ""AFARS"" might be a proper name? Not ideal.
- ""AGARS"": same.

Common words ending with S: 
- ""ALIAS"": but has I? Eliminated.
- ""AMASS"": we thought earlier, but has two S and two A? A at 1 and 3? S at 4 and 5? But we know S cannot be in 4? So in ""AMASS"", positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S? But position 4 is S, which we know is wrong because in guess 3 S was in position 4 and we got a '-', meaning it should not be in 4. So if we put S in 4 again, it will be '-'. Also, S in position 5 might be correct? However, ""AMASS"" has S in both 4 and 5? But if the word has two S, that's possible? And position 5 S might be correct? Position 1 A is correct. Position 3 A? We don't know.

But let's see: ""AMASS"" has letters M and A? And S.

But M is available? Yes.

Another word: ""AWAITS""? Too long.

5-letter: ""ASSES"": but starts with A, then S,S,E,S? But E eliminated. And two S.

""APSES"": has E? Eliminated.

""ALMES"": has E.

""ABYES"": has B and E? Eliminated.

""ACKES"": eliminated.

Hard to find a common word.

But we have ""DAILY"" but doesn't end with S? Not.

Another ending with S: ""ANODE"" eliminated.

Perhaps ""LYAMS""? Doesn't start with A.

We consider words with duplicate letters? Or use S only once.

List of words: 
- ""AZANS"": not common.

I think we have to consider S in the other positions.

Another option: S in position 3.

Try ""A_ S _ _"" 

With available letters: for position 2: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z
Position 4 and 5: same set.

Common words: 
- ""ALAS"": only 4 letters.
- ""ADSUM"": not 5.

""AGAST"": has G,A,S,T? But T is eliminated? T is marked x in guess 2.

""AGASP"": has G,A,S,P? But P eliminated? In guess 3, P is x.

P is eliminated.

So, no T, no P.

But what about L? ""ALSAK""? Not a word.

"" A L S D K""? No.

Perhaps ""K"" at the end? ""ALCKS""? No.

Think differently: include S in position 5, and use common letters for 2,3,4.

Available letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common combinations: use L, M, D.

For example: 
- ""ALLYS"": has L twice? And L and Y? But ""ALLY"" is 4, ""ALLYS"" might be a word? Or ""ALLOW"" but O and not S.
- ""ALMYS"" no.

""ASHED"" no E.

Perhaps ""AWFUL"" but no S.

We need to include S? Only at the end or at position 3.

Let's try a word with S in position 5: ""A _ _ _ S""

Common words: 
- ""ADIOS"": has D,I,O? O eliminated? O is from guess 2, eliminated. I eliminated.
- ""ADVWS"" no.

""AGERS"": has E? No.

""AGLOW"": no S.

""AKSES"": not common.

""ALMES"": has E.

It's tricky.

Focus on what other letters are likely.

Perhaps the word has L or M.

Another idea: in guess 1, we had A as present but not in 3. But now position 1 is A, so that condition is satisfied. And S is in the word, not in 4.

We also have few letters available.

Perhaps we missed a letter that is not eliminated? Like G, K, L, M, W, etc.

We can try to include such letters.

One word: ""AISLE"" but has I and E? Eliminated.

""ACIDS"" has C and I? Eliminated.

""ALIAS"" has I? Eliminated.

But we have to use only available letters.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words starting with A, with S in the word (not position 4), and using only D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z, and S must be in 2,3, or 5.

Assume S in position 5 for now.

Common words ending with S and starting with A, without eliminated letters:

- ""AKAAS"" ? Not common.
- ""ALGAS"": but has G, A, S? And L? Position 1: A,2: L,3: G,4: A,5: S? But we have A at 1 and 4? Duplicate A? And available letters: L,G,A are available? Except A is at 1, but A is in the set? Position 4 is A? We don't know. Also, ""ALGAS"" is a valid word (plural of alga?).

But sea plant? So it's a word.

But it has two A's: A at 1 and 4, and S at 5.

Also, letters L and G.

We can try ""ALGAS"".

Similarly, ""ARRAS"" has R? Eliminated.

""ALMAS"" has M? All available? ""ALMAS"": A (1), L (2), M (3), A (4), S (5)? Again, two A's.

Or ""ADVES"" not a word.

Another: ""AKSED"" has E.

I think ""ALGAS"" or ""ALMAS"" are options.

Similarly, ""AWOLS"" has O? Eliminated.

""AYESS"" not common.

Among ""ALGAS"" and ""ALMAS"", we can choose.

""ALGAS"" might be less common, but it's in dictionaries.

""ALMAS"" is a word in English? It can be plural of alma? alma mater, but not commonly used.

Perhaps ""ALGAE"" but has E.

Or ""AWDLS"" no.

Another common one: ""AWAYS"" has W and Y? But no S in position 5? ""AWAYS"" is A,W,A,Y,S? Position 5 S? S at 5. And letters W and Y available. But ""aways"" is an adverb? Not common in Wordle? But might be accepted.

But ""aways"" has two A's? A at 1 and 3.

Similarly, ""AWASH"" has S and H, but H is eliminated? From guess 3, H is x. So H not allowed.

In guess 3, H is x, so we cannot use H.

So for ""ALGAS"": G and L are available.

G has not been used.

Similarly, for position where S is at 5, we can try.

But to try to test S in position 2 or 3.

Another attempt: S in position 3.

Word: A ? S ? ?

Position 1: A, position 3: S.

Position 2,4,5: from available letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (no eliminated letters).

And S is at 3, so not duplicate unless we add more S, but we avoid.

Possible words:
- ""AXLES"": has X,L,E? E eliminated.
- ""AASKS"" duplicate A and S, not common.

""ABSORB"" too long.

"" A L S K S "" not a word.

Perhaps ""AL S + two letters"".

Like ""ALSO"" but 4 letters.

""ALSYN"" not a word.

"" ALSPH"" no.

It's very difficult to find.

Maybe ""AMASS"" but S in position 5? Then position 4 is S? But we know S can't be in position 4.

In ""AMASS"", position 4 is S, which we know is wrong, so it will not be check. But position 5 S might be correct.

But let's consider it: ""AMASS"" has positions:
1: A (correct)
2: M
3: A
4: S (we know not correct)
5: S

If the word is ""AMASS"", then in our feedback for position 4 S, we'd get a '-' because it's in the word but only one more position? But there is another S at position 5. The feedback would be:
- Position 4: if S is in the word but wrong position, we get '-', which is what we got in guess 3? But this is for a new guess.

But for now, we are guessing ""AMASS"", but we have to use only available letters.

M is available? Yes.

A is at position 1 and 3? Possible.

But let's use this as a guess.

We have other words like ""ASKED"" and ""ASHED"" but have eliminated letters.

Another word: ""ASHES"" has H and E? Eliminated.

I think we must use a word that may have duplicate letters or use common available letters.

Perhaps ""LAWNS"" doesn't start with A.

Let's try to search for words with available letters.

One word: ""AARGH"" has R and G? R eliminated.

""ABACS"" not common.

""ABAYA"" has B and Y? B eliminated.

It's very limited.

Perhaps we missed that some letters are not eliminated.

Eliminated letters are: B,C,E,H,I,N,O,P,R,T,U

From feedback:
- C, R, N, E from guess 1.
- B, O, U, T from guess 2.
- P, I, H from guess 3.

So total eliminated: B,C,E,H,I,N,O,P,R,T,U

Available: A is already at 1, S is in the word, and: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

Now, S must be in position 2,3, or 5.

For example, a word like ""A S K G D"" not a word.

""A G S D K"" not a word.

Common word: ""SALAD"" but that doesn't start with A? It does S A L A D? No, starts with S, but we need start with A? Oh.

Other common words starting with A: ""ANnEX"" eliminated.

Perhaps ""AGL"" ""agley"" not 5 letters.

""AMaZE"" has E.

I think we should consider ""ALGAS"" or ""ALMAS"".

""ALGA "" is 4 letters. Plural is ""ALGAE"" or ""ALGAS""? Some dictionaries accept ""algas"" as the plural of alga, especially in context.

Similarly, ""ALMAS"" might be accepted? Or ""ALMEH"" but has H? Eliminated.

Another word: ""FATAL"" doesn't start with A.

Perhaps ""AUDIO"" but we used about.

Let's choose ""ALGAS"" a ""algas"" is the plural form in some contexts.

Or ""AMASS"" is more common.

""AMASS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

In ""AMASS"", the S is in positions 4 and 5? We know position 4 is not correct, so we expect a '-' for position 4 S in feedback. Position 5 S might be correct.

But we can guess ""amass"" to test.

If the word is ""AMASS"", then:
- Position 1: A ✓
- Position 2: M ?
- Position 3: A ? (possibly duplicate)
- Position 4: S (should be '-')
- Position 5: S ( if this is the only correct S position, but in the word there are two S? Feedback might mark position 5 as 'S' if it's the only correct one? But the word has two S, so position 4 S might be marked as '-', and position 5 S as '✓' if it's correct.

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can use a word with S in position 5 and no other S.

For example, ""AWAKE"" has E? No.

""AWAVE"" not common.

""ASDIC"" has I? No.

I think ""ALGAS"" is a choice: ""ALGAS"" with positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:Gas? ""a-l-g-a-s"", so
pos1: A
pos2: L
pos3: G
pos4: A
pos5: S

So S in position 5.

This tests S at position 5.

And we test L and G.

Also, there is A at position 4, so we test if there is a second A.

Since we have feedback from guess 1 that A is in the word, but not position 3, and now at position 1, it is possible there is another A.

In guess 3, we had no other A, but that doesn't mean there isn't duplicate.

So  guess ""ALGAS"".

Other options: ""ADMAN"" has D and M and N? N eliminated? From guess 1, N is eliminated.

""ADZES"" has D,Z,E,S? E eliminated.

""AFARA"" not common.

""AG   a g a a s"" not.

I think we have to go with ""ALGAS"" or ""AMASS"".

But ""AMASS"" has S in position 4, which we know is wrong, so it will give a '-' for position 4 S, no new information.

Whereas ""ALGAS"" has S in position 5, which is a new position.

Also, if there is only one S in the word, then position 5 might be correct.

So for information, ""ALGAS"" is better because we are testing S in a new position (5).

Similarly, we can test L and G.

So let's choose ""ALGAS"".

But is it in the Wordle dictionary? It might be, as it's a valid if uncommon word.

Another common word: ""AXIAL"" but has X, I, A, L? but I eliminated? In guess 3, I is eliminated.

So ""AXIAL"" not allowed.

""AYahs"" not 5 letters.

So I think ""ALGAS"" is a possible guess.

Perhaps ""KALIM"" not start with A.

Or ""MALMS"" not.

So, we'll guess ""ALGAS"".

In this guess:
- A at 1: correct, so ✓
- L at 2: we will see if in word
- G at 3: see if in word
- A at 4: we will see if duplicate A is present
- S at 5: see if in word or correct position

Feedback will tell us.

So, <guess>algas</guess>

But let's output.### Step-by-Step Thought Process

I have the feedback from three previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - This eliminates C, R, N, E and confirms A is in the word but not in position 3.
- **Guess 2 (""about"")**: A(✓), B(x), O(x), U(x), T(x)  
  - Confirms A is in position 1 and eliminates B, O, U, T.
- **Guess 3 (""apish"")**: A(✓), P(x), I(x), S(-), H(x)  
  - Confirms A in position 1 (redundant but reinforces), eliminates P, I, H, and confirms S is in the word but not in position 4.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Position 1 is fixed as A** (from Guess 2 ✓).
- **S must be in the word** and is not in position 4 (from Guess 3 -). Therefore, possible positions for S are 2, 3, or 5.
- **Eliminated letters (not in word)**: B, C, E, H, I, N, O, P, R, T, U (from all feedback).
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z (S is confirmed in the word).
- **Word structure**: Starts with A (position 1), and has S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5. The word may have duplicates, but we prioritize testing new positions and distinct letters for clarity.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Keep A in position 1** (fixed).
- **Test S in a new position** to narrow down its location. Since S is not allowed in position 4 and was tested there in Guess 3, we prioritize position 5 for this guess (positions 2 and 3 can be tested later if needed).
- **Fill remaining positions** with common unused available letters to maximize information (e.g., L, G for their frequency).
- Choose a **valid English word** from available letters that fits constraints.
- Avoid eliminated letters and minimize duplicates for clearer feedback (though duplicates may be necessary).

### Word Selection:
- Ideal candidate should: start with A, have S in position 5, and use available letters (e.g., L, G).
- **Evaluated options**:
  - ""ALGAS"": Valid 5-letter word meaning ""seaweeds"" (plural of alga). Structure: A (pos1), L (pos2), G (pos3), A (pos4), S (pos5).  
    - Tests S in position 5 (new position).
    - Tests L, G, and potential duplicate A (which is possible but not confirmed).
    - Uses distinct common letters L and G.
  - Alternatives like ""AMASS"" (A, M, A, S, S) were rejected because S is in position 4 (known incorrect, wasting a test), or ""ALIAS"" (has eliminated I).
- **Why ""ALGAS""?**  
  - Tests S in position 5, which could confirm if correct (✓) or rule it out (-/x).
  - Introduces new letters L and G.
  - If A in position 4 is correct (-/✓), it tells us about duplicates.
  - Balances common letters (L, G) and valid structure within constraints.

### Expected Feedback Insight:
The feedback will:
- Confirm position 1 A (✓).
- Reveal if S is in position 5 (✓/-/x) or wrong position (handling duplicates).
- Provide data on L (pos2) and G (pos3), helping reduce possibilities for Guess 5.
- Guide further guesses based on S’s position and new letter eliminations.",Guess 4: algas -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) G(x) A(✓) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,assay,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the secret word)
R: x (not in the secret word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the secret word)
E: x (not in the secret word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word does not contain C, R, N, or E.
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A was the third letter and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).

Therefore, the secret word has the letter A, and it must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is already wrong).

We also know that the secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (to try to find its correct position) and
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word) and
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Let's think of words that have the letter A and other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like S, T, L, I, O, etc.).

We also note that the letter A cannot be in the third position (from the first guess), so we should try A in a different position.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

We might try to put A in the first position for the next guess to see if it's there.

But we also want to cover other common letters. Let's consider the word ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, we have only one A known so far.

Alternatively, we can try a word with A in the second position? Or fourth? 

Let me think of common words without C, R, N, E.

Some options:
- ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's? We don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have A in the second and fifth positions? But we don't know the frequency.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one A as present, but if the word had two A's, we would still only see one '-'? Actually, no. The feedback would show a '-' for every occurrence of A that is in the word but not in the correct position? But wait, if the word has two A's and we have one A in the guess, then we might only get one '-' and the other A might be in the correct position? But in our case, we only have one A in the guess and we got a '-', meaning there is at least one A in the word. There could be more.

But to be safe, we should avoid duplicate letters for now to get clearer information.

So, let's try a word with A and four new distinct letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, P, M, etc.

We can try ""SLATE"", but wait: E is in ""slate"" and we know E is not in the word (from first feedback). So we cannot use E.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, N, E.

So, we must avoid: C, R, N, E.

Let me try to form a word with A and without C, R, N, E.

Possible words: 
- ""PASTA"": has A twice and T, S, P. But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we are avoiding E? Yes, but ""pasta"" doesn't have E. However, it has two A's. We might get confused if the word has one A or two.

Alternatively, ""PLAIT"" -> but that has I and T, but we don't know. Also, it's less common.

Another idea: ""TALON"" -> but N is in it, and we know N is not in the word.

We must avoid N.

So, let's think of words without C, R, N, E and with A.

Common words: 
- ""SALAD"" -> has two A's and D, L, S. But two A's.
- ""ALIAS"" -> two A's and two S's? Not good for information.

We want a word with A and four other distinct letters that are not C, R, N, E.

How about ""AUDIO""? That has A, U, D, I, O. All distinct and none of the forbidden letters.

But is ""AUDIO"" a valid word? Yes, it is.

We can try ""AUDIO"". This way, we test A in the first position and also test U, D, I, O.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in the third position and it was present but wrong position. So if we put A in the first position, we might get:
- If A is in the first position in the secret word, then we get a check (✓) for A.
- If not, then we get a '-' again, meaning A is in the word but not in first position, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Also, we test four new letters: U, D, I, O.

So, let's go with ""AUDIO"".

But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? We are avoiding that for now to get clear feedback.

Alternatively, we can try ""PAINT"" but that has N and T? N is forbidden. So no.

Another word: ""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. This avoids C, R, N, E. And all distinct.

But we have A in the second position? We can try that.

We can also try ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P. Avoids C, R, N, E. And distinct letters.

But note: we don't know if S, T, M, P are in the word. So either ""AUDIO"" or ""STAMP"" or ""MAILS"".

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because it has vowels and we can get information about which vowels are present.

But the secret word might not have U, D, I, O. We don't know.

Alternatively, ""STAMP"" has more common consonants.

Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

Common consonants: S, T, L, P, M, etc.
Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. But we know E is out, so we can try I and O.

But we already know A is in, so we need to find consonants.

I think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because:
- S and T are very common.
- We put A in the third position? But wait, in the first guess, A was in the third position and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not in third. So if we put A in the third position again, we will get a '-' again? Because it's the same wrong position? Actually, we know it's not in third, so we should avoid putting A in third.

In ""STAMP"", A is in the third position. But we already know that A is not in the third position (from first guess). So if we put A in the third again, we will get a '-' again, which doesn't give us new information about the position of A. We want to test a new position.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.

In ""AUDIO"", A is in the first position -> new position.
In ""MAILS"", A is in the second position -> new position.
In ""STAMP"", A is in the third -> same as before, so avoid.

So, let's choose between ""AUDIO"" and ""MAILS"".

We can also consider ""PLAIT"" but that has T and I, and A in third? Again, third position for A is bad.

Another word: ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden.

""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y. Avoids C, R, N, E. And A in second position.

So, ""DAILY"" is an option.

But let's go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests four vowels and we know the word has at least one vowel (A) and we can check for others.

But note: the word might have more vowels or consonants.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has A and common consonants.

I think ""MAILS"" is a good choice: M, A, I, L, S. A in second position.

Similarly, ""DAILY"" is also good.

But let me see: we have to avoid the letters we know are not present: C, R, N, E.

So, I'll choose ""MAILS"".

But wait, in ""MAILS"", we have A in the second position. We hope to get information about whether A is in the second position or not.

If we get a check for A, then we know it's in second. If we get a '-', then we know A is not in second, so it must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Also, we test M, I, L, S.

So, let's go with ""MAILS"".

But note: the word ""MAILS"" is valid.

Alternatively, ""SALAD"" is also valid but has duplicate A.

I think ""MAILS"" is better.

Another common word: ""PLAIT"" but A is in third? We avoid third.

""TOPAZ"": T, O, P, A, Z -> A in fourth position. That's good. And distinct letters.

But Z is less common.

""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. Avoids C, R, N, E.

""ABOUT"" is a good candidate.

But we have two options: ""ABOUT"" (A in first) and ""MAILS"" (A in second).

I think both are fine. Let me pick ""ABOUT"" because it has more common letters? Or ""MAILS""?

We can also consider ""ADIEU"", but E is forbidden? ""ADIEU"" has E, which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

So, ""ABOUT"" is okay.

But let's decide: I'll go with ""ABOUT"" because it tests A in the first position and B, O, U, T.

So, our second guess: ""ABOUT""

But note: we are not sure if the word has B, O, U, T. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can use ""STOMP"" but that doesn't have A? We must include A because we know it's in the word. Otherwise, we won't get information about A.

So, we must include A in the guess.

Therefore, we choose a word that includes A and four new letters.

So, ""ABOUT"" is a valid choice.

Let me write it: A in first, B in second, O in third, U in fourth, T in fifth.

We'll see the feedback.

So, the guess is ""about"".

But note: the word ""about"" is 5 letters and valid.

So, I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with ""-"").

Key insights:
- The secret word contains the letter A, which must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect).
- Avoid using C, R, N, E in future guesses.
- For the second guess, prioritize a word that:
  - Includes A in a new position (not position 3) to test its location.
  - Uses common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, B, U) to maximize information.
  - Avoids duplicate letters for clearer feedback.

After evaluating options like ""audio"" (A in position 1), ""mails"" (A in position 2), and ""about"" (A in position 1), ""about"" was selected because:
- It tests A in position 1 (a new position to verify).
- It introduces four new common letters (B, O, U, T) not yet tested.
- All letters are distinct, simplifying feedback interpretation.

<guess>about</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""about""
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 1)
- B: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- U: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)

Now, combining the information:

1. The secret word has the letter 'A' in the first position (from guess 2: A is correct and in position 1).
2. Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T (from both guesses, all marked with x).
3. We know the word starts with 'A'.

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with 'A'
- Does not contain: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T
- And from the first guess, we know that the word has an 'A' but not in position 3. However, now we know that 'A' is in position 1, so that condition is satisfied.

Since we have the first letter fixed as 'A', we need to guess the remaining four letters.

We have eliminated many common letters. The available letters are the remaining consonants and vowels that haven't been tried.

Available letters (from the alphabet, excluding the known absent ones: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U).

So, absent letters: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to form a word starting with 'A' and using only the available letters.

Common words starting with 'A' without the forbidden letters:

- ""APPLE"": but has P and L, but also E? E is forbidden. So no.
- ""ANGRY"": has N and R? Both forbidden. No.
- ""ALIEN"": has E and N? Forbidden. No.
- ""ADIEU"": has E and U? Forbidden. No.

Let's think of words starting with 'A' and using only D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:

- ""ALPHA"": A, L, P, H, A -> but has two A's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have A in first, so the last A would be in position 5. But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, we can try.

But let's check the letters: A (first), L, P, H, A (fifth). The available letters are fine (L, P, H are available). But we have two A's. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. So it's acceptable.

But we might get ambiguous feedback if there is only one A? Actually, since the first A is correct, the last A might be marked as absent if not in the word, or present if it is.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate A to avoid confusion.

Other words:

- ""AMPLY"": A, M, P, L, Y -> all letters available. And distinct except? All distinct: A, M, P, L, Y.

""AMPLY"" is a word meaning ""in an ample manner"".

- ""APPLY"": but has P, P, L, Y? And A. But two P's? And E? No, ""apply"" is A, P, P, L, Y. But we have two P's. Also, no E. But we don't know about duplicates. And P is available.

But ""apply"" has two P's, which might complicate.

- ""ALLY"": only 4 letters? No, we need 5.

5-letter words:

- ""ALIGN"": has G and N? N is forbidden. No.
- ""ALIKE"": has E? Forbidden. No.
- ""ALIVE"": has E? Forbidden. No.
- ""ALOUD"": has O and U? Forbidden. No.
- ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> but T is forbidden (from guess 2: T is x). So no.

T is forbidden? From guess 2, T is marked x, so not in the word.

Similarly, O, U, B are forbidden.

So, in ""AMPLY"": A, M, P, L, Y. Check forbidden: M, P, L, Y are not in the forbidden list. And T is not in it. So okay.

But we must avoid T? Yes, T is forbidden.

Another word: ""APHID"": A, P, H, I, D. All available letters: P, H, I, D. And distinct.

""Aphid"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""AVOID"": has O? Forbidden. No.

""AXIAL"": has X, I, A, L. But two A's? And X and I and L are available. But we have A in first and fifth. So duplicate A.

""AMISS"": A, M, I, S, S. Two S's? And M, I, S available.

But duplicate S.

To maximize information, we should prefer words with distinct letters.

So, ""APHID"" has distinct letters: A, P, H, I, D.

""AMPLY"" has distinct letters: A, M, P, L, Y.

Both are good.

We can also consider ""ASKEW"": A, S, K, E, W -> but E is forbidden. No.

""AZURE"": has U and E? Forbidden. No.

""ANVIL"": has N? Forbidden. No.

So, let's choose between ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"".

We might also consider ""ALPHA"" but it has two A's.

Another one: ""ADAPT"": has D, A, P, T -> T is forbidden. No.

""AGILE"": has E? Forbidden. No.

""ALGAE"": has E? Forbidden. No.

""ALMOND"": 6 letters? No.

So, 5-letter words: ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"" are candidates.

We can also consider ""WALTZ"": but doesn't start with A? We need to start with A.

We must start with A.

Another word: ""AWAIT"": has W, A, I, T -> but T is forbidden. And two A's? A in first and third? But T is forbidden.

""AVAIL"": has V, A, I, L -> and two A's? A in first and third? But we have A in first, so the third A might be duplicate. And V, I, L are available.

But duplicate A.

Similarly, ""AORTA"": has O? Forbidden.

So, back to ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"".

We can also consider ""ASHEN"": has E? Forbidden.

""ASPEN"": has E? Forbidden.

""AXIOM"": has O? Forbidden.

""AZOIC"": has O and I? O forbidden.

""ABYSS"": has B and Y, S, S? B forbidden.

So, I think ""APHID"" or ""AMPLY"" are good.

Let's pick ""AMPLY"" because it has more common letters? M, P, L, Y.

But Y is less common at the end? But it's acceptable.

We can also consider ""AMBER"": has B and E? Forbidden.

So, I'll go with ""AMPLY"".

But let's confirm: 
- A: we know is correct in position 1, so we expect a check for A.
- Then we test M in position 2, P in position 3, L in position 4, Y in position 5.

If any of these are in the word, we get feedback.

We might also get information about duplicate A? But since we don't have another A, we won't.

So, guess: ""AMPLY""

But note: we have to output in the required format.

Alternatively, we can think of other words.

Another word: ""AVID"": only 4 letters.

""APISH"": A, P, I, S, H. All distinct and available: P, I, S, H.

""APISH"" is a word (meaning resembling an ape).

Similarly, ""APHID"" and ""APISH"" are both good.

""AMPLY"" is also good.

I think any of these are fine. Let's choose ""APISH"" because it has S and H, which are common.

But we have no strong preference.

We can also consider ""ASKED"": has E? Forbidden.

""ALPHS"": not a common word.

I'll go with ""APHID"" for now.

But let's see: we have to make a guess.

We can also consider the frequency of letters.

Common letters left: S, L, I, P, M, D, etc.

We can try to cover more common ones.

""APHID"" has P, H, I, D.

""AMPLY"" has M, P, L, Y.

""APISH"" has P, I, S, H.

S is more common than D or Y, so ""APISH"" might be better.

Similarly, H is common.

So, let's choose ""APISH"".

But we must start with A, so ""APISH"": A (position 1), P (2), I (3), S (4), H (5).

We know A is correct in position 1, so we are testing P, I, S, H.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So, I'll go with ""apish"".

But let's write it.

Alternatively, we can use ""ASHAM"" but that has two A's? A in first and fourth? And S, H, M. But ""asham"" is not a word? I think ""asham"" is not standard. ""ASHAM"" might be a name, but not common.

""ASHEN"" has E.

So, ""APISH"" is valid.

Another common word: ""ASPIC"" but C is forbidden.

So, I think ""APISH"" is acceptable.

But let's confirm the word: ""apish"" is an adjective meaning ""foolishly silly"" or ""resembling an ape"".

In Wordle, it might be in the dictionary.

Similarly, ""APHID"" is a noun.

Both are valid.

I'll choose ""APISH"" to include S.

So, the guess is ""apish"".

But note: in the feedback, we will get:

- A: ✓ (since we know it's correct in position 1)
- P: ? 
- I: ?
- S: ?
- H: ?

And we'll see which are present and in what positions.

So, <guess>apish</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Eliminated letters C, R, N, E (all marked ""x""), and confirmed A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- **Guess 2 (""about"")**: Confirmed A is in position 1 (marked ""✓""), and eliminated B, O, U, T (all marked ""x"").

### Current Knowledge:
- **Correct position**: A is the first letter (position 1).
- **Eliminated letters**: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U (cannot appear in the word).
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Word structure**: Starts with A, followed by four letters from the available set. The word must be a valid English word.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize words starting with A and using common unused letters (e.g., S, L, I, P, M, H) to maximize information.
- Avoid eliminated letters and duplicate letters for clearer feedback.
- Test potential letters in new positions to narrow down possibilities.

Selected guess: **""APISH""** (meaning ""foolishly silly"" or ""resembling an ape"").  
- Why ""APISH""?  
  - Starts with A (confirmed position 1).  
  - Uses distinct, common available letters: P (position 2), I (position 3), S (position 4), H (position 5).  
  - Tests high-frequency consonants (S, P, H) and a vowel (I), which could reveal more about the word's structure.  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and duplicates.  

This guess will provide feedback on P, I, S, and H, helping to identify correct letters and their positions for the next guess.

<guess>apish</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)
Guess 3: apish -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) P(x) I(x) S(-) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; specifically, not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""about""
- A: ✓ (correct, position 1)
- B: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- U: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""apish""
- A: ✓ (correct, position 1)
- P: x (not in word)
- I: x (not in word)
- S: - (in word, wrong position; not position 4)
- H: x (not in word)

Now, combining all information:

1. The word starts with A (position 1 is fixed as A).
2. Letters not in the word (eliminated): B, C, E, I, N, O, P, R, T, U, H.
   - From guess 1: C, R, N, E
   - From guess 2: B, O, U, T
   - From guess 3: P, I, H
   - So eliminated: B,C,E,H,I,N,O,P,R,T,U.

3. Letters that are in the word:
   - A is in the word and fixed at position 1.
   - From guess 3, S is in the word (since we got a '-') but not in position 4.
   - Additionally, from guess 1, A was marked as present but not in position 3. But now that position 1 is A, that is consistent.

We know the word must have S, and it cannot be in position 4 (from guess 3), and cannot be in position 1 (since position 1 is A). So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Also, we have eliminated many letters, so what's left?

Available letters: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But S is already known to be in the word. So the word has at least two letters: A and S.

The word has positions: 
Position 1: A
Position 2: ? (cannot be S if S is not in position 4, but S could be here? Wait, no restriction yet except the eliminated letters)
Actually, S can be in position 2, since we put S in position 4 and got '-', meaning S is in the word but not in 4. It could be in 2, 3, or 5.

We don't know if there are other letters.

The word might have more than two unique letters? But we only know A and S for sure.

Now, we need to form a word that starts with A, includes S (in one of positions 2,3,5) and uses only available letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,S,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Also, we must avoid the eliminated letters.

For the next guess, we should:
1. Keep A in position 1 (since it's correct).
2. Include S in a new position to test: either 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 was wrong).
   - We should try to place S in one of these positions to see if it fits.
3. Fill the remaining positions with new common letters from the available set.

We have three possibilities for S: positions 2, 3, or 5.

We can prioritize testing S in position 2, for example.

To maximize information, we can choose a word with S in position 2 and distinct new letters.

Available common letters: L, M, D, F, G, K, etc.

Note: We have only 6 tries, and this is our fourth guess.

What words start with A and have S in the second position?

If S is in position 2: A S _ _ _

Possible words: 
- ""ASKEW"": but has E, which is eliminated? Yes, E is not allowed.
- ""ASPIC"": has C? Eliminated.
- ""ASSAY"": but has S twice? And A? We have A already in position 1, so if we put S in position 2, then S again in position 3? But we don't know if S appears multiple times. Also, 'A' in position 5? But we have A fixed at position 1, and we don't know about duplicate A. However, ""assay"" has S and S, and A at the end? But position 1 is A, and if the word ends with A, that's possible? But in our feedback, when we had ""crane"", we had A as '-' meaning present but not position 3. And with ""apish"", we didn't have another A. So it's possible.

But to avoid complexity, we should test words without duplicates first.

Another word: ""ASHED"": has E? Eliminated.

""ASKED"": has E and K? But E eliminated.

So no.

What about S in position 3: A _ S _ _

Possible words:
- ""AEGIS"": has E? Eliminated.
- ""ALIAS"": has L, I? I eliminated (from guess 3). Also, I is not allowed.
- ""ABBAS"": has B? Eliminated.

Without eliminated letters:

Available: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,S,V,W,X,Y,Z

So, ""A?S??"" with ? from available.

For example:
- ""AMASS"": A, M, A, S, S? But we have two A's? Position 1 is A, then position 3 is S? Position 5 is S? And M at position 2? Then position 4 is S? Actually, ""AMASS"" is A (1), M (2), A (3), S (4). But position 3 is A? We don't know if A is duplicated. Also, position 4 is S? But in guess 3, S was not in position 4 because we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there. So S wouldn't be correct in position 4? Same reason? In guess 3, S was in position 4 and got '-', so S is not in position 4. Therefore, we cannot put S in position 4 again? We shouldn't.

In our next guess, if we put S in position 4, we expect a '-' again (if it's not correct, but we know it's not) so it doesn't help. So we should avoid position 4 for S.

So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Trying to form words with S in position 2: 
- Must be ""A S ? ? ?""
Letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (since S is used at position 2).

And the word must have only one S? Not necessarily, but to avoid duplicates, we try one S.

So, ""AS..."" words without eliminated letters.

Possible:
- ""ASKEW"" no, E.
- ""ASDIC"": has D, I? I eliminated? Wait, I is eliminated? From guess 3, I is marked x, so yes, not allowed.
""ASDIC"": A,S,D,I,C? But C and I eliminated? And C is eliminated too? So no.

Another: ""ASWAY"" ? Not common.

""ASKOI"": has O and I? Both eliminated? No.

""ASKED"" no E.

Perhaps no common words with S in position 2 without using eliminated letters.

Similarly, for S in position 3: ""A ? S ? ?""

Possible:
- ""AULOS"": has O and U? Eliminated.
- ""AXIOM"": has O? Eliminated.
- ""ADSES"": not a word.

Without eliminated letters.

For example: ""A G S V D"" ? Not a word.

Common words: 
- ""AGISM"": not common? Also, has I? Eliminated.
- ""ALMES"": has E? Eliminated.

It's difficult.

S in position 5: ""A ? ? ? S""

So positions: 1: A, 5: S.

And 2,3,4 from available letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we exclude S for the middle positions? Or we can have S again? But let's try without duplicate first.

Possible words:
- ""ADVWS""? Not a word.
- ""AFARS"": but that's two S? ""afars"" is not common? ""AFARS"" might be a proper name? Not ideal.
- ""AGARS"": same.

Common words ending with S: 
- ""ALIAS"": but has I? Eliminated.
- ""AMASS"": we thought earlier, but has two S and two A? A at 1 and 3? S at 4 and 5? But we know S cannot be in 4? So in ""AMASS"", positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S? But position 4 is S, which we know is wrong because in guess 3 S was in position 4 and we got a '-', meaning it should not be in 4. So if we put S in 4 again, it will be '-'. Also, S in position 5 might be correct? However, ""AMASS"" has S in both 4 and 5? But if the word has two S, that's possible? And position 5 S might be correct? Position 1 A is correct. Position 3 A? We don't know.

But let's see: ""AMASS"" has letters M and A? And S.

But M is available? Yes.

Another word: ""AWAITS""? Too long.

5-letter: ""ASSES"": but starts with A, then S,S,E,S? But E eliminated. And two S.

""APSES"": has E? Eliminated.

""ALMES"": has E.

""ABYES"": has B and E? Eliminated.

""ACKES"": eliminated.

Hard to find a common word.

But we have ""DAILY"" but doesn't end with S? Not.

Another ending with S: ""ANODE"" eliminated.

Perhaps ""LYAMS""? Doesn't start with A.

We consider words with duplicate letters? Or use S only once.

List of words: 
- ""AZANS"": not common.

I think we have to consider S in the other positions.

Another option: S in position 3.

Try ""A_ S _ _"" 

With available letters: for position 2: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z
Position 4 and 5: same set.

Common words: 
- ""ALAS"": only 4 letters.
- ""ADSUM"": not 5.

""AGAST"": has G,A,S,T? But T is eliminated? T is marked x in guess 2.

""AGASP"": has G,A,S,P? But P eliminated? In guess 3, P is x.

P is eliminated.

So, no T, no P.

But what about L? ""ALSAK""? Not a word.

"" A L S D K""? No.

Perhaps ""K"" at the end? ""ALCKS""? No.

Think differently: include S in position 5, and use common letters for 2,3,4.

Available letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common combinations: use L, M, D.

For example: 
- ""ALLYS"": has L twice? And L and Y? But ""ALLY"" is 4, ""ALLYS"" might be a word? Or ""ALLOW"" but O and not S.
- ""ALMYS"" no.

""ASHED"" no E.

Perhaps ""AWFUL"" but no S.

We need to include S? Only at the end or at position 3.

Let's try a word with S in position 5: ""A _ _ _ S""

Common words: 
- ""ADIOS"": has D,I,O? O eliminated? O is from guess 2, eliminated. I eliminated.
- ""ADVWS"" no.

""AGERS"": has E? No.

""AGLOW"": no S.

""AKSES"": not common.

""ALMES"": has E.

It's tricky.

Focus on what other letters are likely.

Perhaps the word has L or M.

Another idea: in guess 1, we had A as present but not in 3. But now position 1 is A, so that condition is satisfied. And S is in the word, not in 4.

We also have few letters available.

Perhaps we missed a letter that is not eliminated? Like G, K, L, M, W, etc.

We can try to include such letters.

One word: ""AISLE"" but has I and E? Eliminated.

""ACIDS"" has C and I? Eliminated.

""ALIAS"" has I? Eliminated.

But we have to use only available letters.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words starting with A, with S in the word (not position 4), and using only D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z, and S must be in 2,3, or 5.

Assume S in position 5 for now.

Common words ending with S and starting with A, without eliminated letters:

- ""AKAAS"" ? Not common.
- ""ALGAS"": but has G, A, S? And L? Position 1: A,2: L,3: G,4: A,5: S? But we have A at 1 and 4? Duplicate A? And available letters: L,G,A are available? Except A is at 1, but A is in the set? Position 4 is A? We don't know. Also, ""ALGAS"" is a valid word (plural of alga?).

But sea plant? So it's a word.

But it has two A's: A at 1 and 4, and S at 5.

Also, letters L and G.

We can try ""ALGAS"".

Similarly, ""ARRAS"" has R? Eliminated.

""ALMAS"" has M? All available? ""ALMAS"": A (1), L (2), M (3), A (4), S (5)? Again, two A's.

Or ""ADVES"" not a word.

Another: ""AKSED"" has E.

I think ""ALGAS"" or ""ALMAS"" are options.

Similarly, ""AWOLS"" has O? Eliminated.

""AYESS"" not common.

Among ""ALGAS"" and ""ALMAS"", we can choose.

""ALGAS"" might be less common, but it's in dictionaries.

""ALMAS"" is a word in English? It can be plural of alma? alma mater, but not commonly used.

Perhaps ""ALGAE"" but has E.

Or ""AWDLS"" no.

Another common one: ""AWAYS"" has W and Y? But no S in position 5? ""AWAYS"" is A,W,A,Y,S? Position 5 S? S at 5. And letters W and Y available. But ""aways"" is an adverb? Not common in Wordle? But might be accepted.

But ""aways"" has two A's? A at 1 and 3.

Similarly, ""AWASH"" has S and H, but H is eliminated? From guess 3, H is x. So H not allowed.

In guess 3, H is x, so we cannot use H.

So for ""ALGAS"": G and L are available.

G has not been used.

Similarly, for position where S is at 5, we can try.

But to try to test S in position 2 or 3.

Another attempt: S in position 3.

Word: A ? S ? ?

Position 1: A, position 3: S.

Position 2,4,5: from available letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (no eliminated letters).

And S is at 3, so not duplicate unless we add more S, but we avoid.

Possible words:
- ""AXLES"": has X,L,E? E eliminated.
- ""AASKS"" duplicate A and S, not common.

""ABSORB"" too long.

"" A L S K S "" not a word.

Perhaps ""AL S + two letters"".

Like ""ALSO"" but 4 letters.

""ALSYN"" not a word.

"" ALSPH"" no.

It's very difficult to find.

Maybe ""AMASS"" but S in position 5? Then position 4 is S? But we know S can't be in position 4.

In ""AMASS"", position 4 is S, which we know is wrong, so it will not be check. But position 5 S might be correct.

But let's consider it: ""AMASS"" has positions:
1: A (correct)
2: M
3: A
4: S (we know not correct)
5: S

If the word is ""AMASS"", then in our feedback for position 4 S, we'd get a '-' because it's in the word but only one more position? But there is another S at position 5. The feedback would be:
- Position 4: if S is in the word but wrong position, we get '-', which is what we got in guess 3? But this is for a new guess.

But for now, we are guessing ""AMASS"", but we have to use only available letters.

M is available? Yes.

A is at position 1 and 3? Possible.

But let's use this as a guess.

We have other words like ""ASKED"" and ""ASHED"" but have eliminated letters.

Another word: ""ASHES"" has H and E? Eliminated.

I think we must use a word that may have duplicate letters or use common available letters.

Perhaps ""LAWNS"" doesn't start with A.

Let's try to search for words with available letters.

One word: ""AARGH"" has R and G? R eliminated.

""ABACS"" not common.

""ABAYA"" has B and Y? B eliminated.

It's very limited.

Perhaps we missed that some letters are not eliminated.

Eliminated letters are: B,C,E,H,I,N,O,P,R,T,U

From feedback:
- C, R, N, E from guess 1.
- B, O, U, T from guess 2.
- P, I, H from guess 3.

So total eliminated: B,C,E,H,I,N,O,P,R,T,U

Available: A is already at 1, S is in the word, and: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

Now, S must be in position 2,3, or 5.

For example, a word like ""A S K G D"" not a word.

""A G S D K"" not a word.

Common word: ""SALAD"" but that doesn't start with A? It does S A L A D? No, starts with S, but we need start with A? Oh.

Other common words starting with A: ""ANnEX"" eliminated.

Perhaps ""AGL"" ""agley"" not 5 letters.

""AMaZE"" has E.

I think we should consider ""ALGAS"" or ""ALMAS"".

""ALGA "" is 4 letters. Plural is ""ALGAE"" or ""ALGAS""? Some dictionaries accept ""algas"" as the plural of alga, especially in context.

Similarly, ""ALMAS"" might be accepted? Or ""ALMEH"" but has H? Eliminated.

Another word: ""FATAL"" doesn't start with A.

Perhaps ""AUDIO"" but we used about.

Let's choose ""ALGAS"" a ""algas"" is the plural form in some contexts.

Or ""AMASS"" is more common.

""AMASS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

In ""AMASS"", the S is in positions 4 and 5? We know position 4 is not correct, so we expect a '-' for position 4 S in feedback. Position 5 S might be correct.

But we can guess ""amass"" to test.

If the word is ""AMASS"", then:
- Position 1: A ✓
- Position 2: M ?
- Position 3: A ? (possibly duplicate)
- Position 4: S (should be '-')
- Position 5: S ( if this is the only correct S position, but in the word there are two S? Feedback might mark position 5 as 'S' if it's the only correct one? But the word has two S, so position 4 S might be marked as '-', and position 5 S as '✓' if it's correct.

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can use a word with S in position 5 and no other S.

For example, ""AWAKE"" has E? No.

""AWAVE"" not common.

""ASDIC"" has I? No.

I think ""ALGAS"" is a choice: ""ALGAS"" with positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:Gas? ""a-l-g-a-s"", so
pos1: A
pos2: L
pos3: G
pos4: A
pos5: S

So S in position 5.

This tests S at position 5.

And we test L and G.

Also, there is A at position 4, so we test if there is a second A.

Since we have feedback from guess 1 that A is in the word, but not position 3, and now at position 1, it is possible there is another A.

In guess 3, we had no other A, but that doesn't mean there isn't duplicate.

So  guess ""ALGAS"".

Other options: ""ADMAN"" has D and M and N? N eliminated? From guess 1, N is eliminated.

""ADZES"" has D,Z,E,S? E eliminated.

""AFARA"" not common.

""AG   a g a a s"" not.

I think we have to go with ""ALGAS"" or ""AMASS"".

But ""AMASS"" has S in position 4, which we know is wrong, so it will give a '-' for position 4 S, no new information.

Whereas ""ALGAS"" has S in position 5, which is a new position.

Also, if there is only one S in the word, then position 5 might be correct.

So for information, ""ALGAS"" is better because we are testing S in a new position (5).

Similarly, we can test L and G.

So let's choose ""ALGAS"".

But is it in the Wordle dictionary? It might be, as it's a valid if uncommon word.

Another common word: ""AXIAL"" but has X, I, A, L? but I eliminated? In guess 3, I is eliminated.

So ""AXIAL"" not allowed.

""AYahs"" not 5 letters.

So I think ""ALGAS"" is a possible guess.

Perhaps ""KALIM"" not start with A.

Or ""MALMS"" not.

So, we'll guess ""ALGAS"".

In this guess:
- A at 1: correct, so ✓
- L at 2: we will see if in word
- G at 3: see if in word
- A at 4: we will see if duplicate A is present
- S at 5: see if in word or correct position

Feedback will tell us.

So, <guess>algas</guess>

But let's output.### Step-by-Step Thought Process

I have the feedback from three previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - This eliminates C, R, N, E and confirms A is in the word but not in position 3.
- **Guess 2 (""about"")**: A(✓), B(x), O(x), U(x), T(x)  
  - Confirms A is in position 1 and eliminates B, O, U, T.
- **Guess 3 (""apish"")**: A(✓), P(x), I(x), S(-), H(x)  
  - Confirms A in position 1 (redundant but reinforces), eliminates P, I, H, and confirms S is in the word but not in position 4.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Position 1 is fixed as A** (from Guess 2 ✓).
- **S must be in the word** and is not in position 4 (from Guess 3 -). Therefore, possible positions for S are 2, 3, or 5.
- **Eliminated letters (not in word)**: B, C, E, H, I, N, O, P, R, T, U (from all feedback).
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z (S is confirmed in the word).
- **Word structure**: Starts with A (position 1), and has S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5. The word may have duplicates, but we prioritize testing new positions and distinct letters for clarity.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Keep A in position 1** (fixed).
- **Test S in a new position** to narrow down its location. Since S is not allowed in position 4 and was tested there in Guess 3, we prioritize position 5 for this guess (positions 2 and 3 can be tested later if needed).
- **Fill remaining positions** with common unused available letters to maximize information (e.g., L, G for their frequency).
- Choose a **valid English word** from available letters that fits constraints.
- Avoid eliminated letters and minimize duplicates for clearer feedback (though duplicates may be necessary).

### Word Selection:
- Ideal candidate should: start with A, have S in position 5, and use available letters (e.g., L, G).
- **Evaluated options**:
  - ""ALGAS"": Valid 5-letter word meaning ""seaweeds"" (plural of alga). Structure: A (pos1), L (pos2), G (pos3), A (pos4), S (pos5).  
    - Tests S in position 5 (new position).
    - Tests L, G, and potential duplicate A (which is possible but not confirmed).
    - Uses distinct common letters L and G.
  - Alternatives like ""AMASS"" (A, M, A, S, S) were rejected because S is in position 4 (known incorrect, wasting a test), or ""ALIAS"" (has eliminated I).
- **Why ""ALGAS""?**  
  - Tests S in position 5, which could confirm if correct (✓) or rule it out (-/x).
  - Introduces new letters L and G.
  - If A in position 4 is correct (-/✓), it tells us about duplicates.
  - Balances common letters (L, G) and valid structure within constraints.

### Expected Feedback Insight:
The feedback will:
- Confirm position 1 A (✓).
- Reveal if S is in position 5 (✓/-/x) or wrong position (handling duplicates).
- Provide data on L (pos2) and G (pos3), helping reduce possibilities for Guess 5.
- Guide further guesses based on S’s position and new letter eliminations.

We should choose a word that:\n- Includes the letter A (to try to find its correct position) and\n- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word) and\n- Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have the letter A and other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet (like S, T, L, I, O, etc.).\n\nWe also note that the letter A cannot be in the third position (from the first guess), so we should try A in a different position.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\nWe might try to put A in the first position for the next guess to see if it\'s there.\n\nBut we also want to cover other common letters. Let\'s consider the word ""SALAD"", but that has two A\'s and we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, we have only one A known so far.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with A in the second position? Or fourth? \n\nLet me think of common words without C, R, N, E.\n\nSome options:\n- ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> but two A\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we have A in the second and fifth positions? But we don\'t know the frequency.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one A as present, but if the word had two A\'s, we would still only see one \'-\'? Actually, no. The feedback would show a \'-\' for every occurrence of A that is in the word but not in the correct position? But wait, if the word has two A\'s and we have one A in the guess, then we might only get one \'-\' and the other A might be in the correct position? But in our case, we only have one A in the guess and we got a \'-\', meaning there is at least one A in the word. There could be more.\n\nBut to be safe, we should avoid duplicate letters for now to get clearer information.\n\nSo, let\'s try a word with A and four new distinct letters.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, P, M, etc.\n\nWe can try ""SLATE"", but wait: E is in ""slate"" and we know E is not in the word (from first feedback). So we cannot use E.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use C, R, N, E.\n\nSo, we must avoid: C, R, N, E.\n\nLet me try to form a word with A and without C, R, N, E.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""PASTA"": has A twice and T, S, P. But we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we are avoiding E? Yes, but ""pasta"" doesn\'t have E. However, it has two A\'s. We might get confused if the word has one A or two.\n\nAlternatively, ""PLAIT"" -> but that has I and T, but we don\'t know. Also, it\'s less common.\n\nAnother idea: ""TALON"" -> but N is in it, and we know N is not in the word.\n\nWe must avoid N.\n\nSo, let\'s think of words without C, R, N, E and with A.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""SALAD"" -> has two A\'s and D, L, S. But two A\'s.\n- ""ALIAS"" -> two A\'s and two S\'s? Not good for information.\n\nWe want a word with A and four other distinct letters that are not C, R, N, E.\n\nHow about ""AUDIO""? That has A, U, D, I, O. All distinct and none of the forbidden letters.\n\nBut is ""AUDIO"" a valid word? Yes, it is.\n\nWe can try ""AUDIO"". This way, we test A in the first position and also test U, D, I, O.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A in the third position and it was present but wrong position. So if we put A in the first position, we might get:\n- If A is in the first position in the secret word, then we get a check (✓) for A.\n- If not, then we get a \'-\' again, meaning A is in the word but not in first position, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nAlso, we test four new letters: U, D, I, O.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""AUDIO"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? We are avoiding that for now to get clear feedback.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""PAINT"" but that has N and T? N is forbidden. So no.\n\nAnother word: ""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. This avoids C, R, N, E. And all distinct.\n\nBut we have A in the second position? We can try that.\n\nWe can also try ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P. Avoids C, R, N, E. And distinct letters.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if S, T, M, P are in the word. So either ""AUDIO"" or ""STAMP"" or ""MAILS"".\n\nI think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because it has vowels and we can get information about which vowels are present.\n\nBut the secret word might not have U, D, I, O. We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, ""STAMP"" has more common consonants.\n\nLet me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, P, M, etc.\nCommon vowels: A, E, I, O, U. But we know E is out, so we can try I and O.\n\nBut we already know A is in, so we need to find consonants.\n\nI think ""STAMP"" is a good choice because:\n- S and T are very common.\n- We put A in the third position? But wait, in the first guess, A was in the third position and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not in third. So if we put A in the third position again, we will get a \'-\' again? Because it\'s the same wrong position? Actually, we know it\'s not in third, so we should avoid putting A in third.\n\nIn ""STAMP"", A is in the third position. But we already know that A is not in the third position (from first guess). So if we put A in the third again, we will get a \'-\' again, which doesn\'t give us new information about the position of A. We want to test a new position.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid putting A in the third position.\n\nIn ""AUDIO"", A is in the first position -> new position.\nIn ""MAILS"", A is in the second position -> new position.\nIn ""STAMP"", A is in the third -> same as before, so avoid.\n\nSo, let\'s choose between ""AUDIO"" and ""MAILS"".\n\nWe can also consider ""PLAIT"" but that has T and I, and A in third? Again, third position for A is bad.\n\nAnother word: ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden.\n\n""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y. Avoids C, R, N, E. And A in second position.\n\nSo, ""DAILY"" is an option.\n\nBut let\'s go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests four vowels and we know the word has at least one vowel (A) and we can check for others.\n\nBut note: the word might have more vowels or consonants.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has A and common consonants.\n\nI think ""MAILS"" is a good choice: M, A, I, L, S. A in second position.\n\nSimilarly, ""DAILY"" is also good.\n\nBut let me see: we have to avoid the letters we know are not present: C, R, N, E.\n\nSo, I\'ll choose ""MAILS"".\n\nBut wait, in ""MAILS"", we have A in the second position. We hope to get information about whether A is in the second position or not.\n\nIf we get a check for A, then we know it\'s in second. If we get a \'-\', then we know A is not in second, so it must be in 1, 4, or 5.\n\nAlso, we test M, I, L, S.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""MAILS"".\n\nBut note: the word ""MAILS"" is valid.\n\nAlternatively, ""SALAD"" is also valid but has duplicate A.\n\nI think ""MAILS"" is better.\n\nAnother common word: ""PLAIT"" but A is in third? We avoid third.\n\n""TOPAZ"": T, O, P, A, Z -> A in fourth position. That\'s good. And distinct letters.\n\nBut Z is less common.\n\n""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> A in first. Avoids C, R, N, E.\n\n""ABOUT"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut we have two options: ""ABOUT"" (A in first) and ""MAILS"" (A in second).\n\nI think both are fine. Let me pick ""ABOUT"" because it has more common letters? Or ""MAILS""?\n\nWe can also consider ""ADIEU"", but E is forbidden? ""ADIEU"" has E, which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n\nSo, ""ABOUT"" is okay.\n\nBut let\'s decide: I\'ll go with ""ABOUT"" because it tests A in the first position and B, O, U, T.\n\nSo, our second guess: ""ABOUT""\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has B, O, U, T. We are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""STOMP"" but that doesn\'t have A? We must include A because we know it\'s in the word. Otherwise, we won\'t get information about A.\n\nSo, we must include A in the guess.\n\nTherefore, we choose a word that includes A and four new letters.\n\nSo, ""ABOUT"" is a valid choice.\n\nLet me write it: A in first, B in second, O in third, U in fourth, T in fifth.\n\nWe\'ll see the feedback.\n\nSo, the guess is ""about"".\n\nBut note: the word ""about"" is 5 letters and valid.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with ""-"").\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word contains the letter A, which must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect).\n- Avoid using C, R, N, E in future guesses.\n- For the second guess, prioritize a word that:\n  - Includes A in a new position (not position 3) to test its location.\n  - Uses common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, B, U) to maximize information.\n  - Avoids duplicate letters for clearer feedback.\n\nAfter evaluating options like ""audio"" (A in position 1), ""mails"" (A in position 2), and ""about"" (A in position 1), ""about"" was selected because:\n- It tests A in position 1 (a new position to verify).\n- It introduces four new common letters (B, O, U, T) not yet tested.\n- All letters are distinct, simplifying feedback interpretation.\n\n<guess>about</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""about""\n- A: ✓ (correct, in position 1)\n- B: x (not in the word)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n- U: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n\nNow, combining the information:\n\n1. The secret word has the letter \'A\' in the first position (from guess 2: A is correct and in position 1).\n2. Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T (from both guesses, all marked with x).\n3. We know the word starts with \'A\'.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that:\n- Starts with \'A\'\n- Does not contain: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T\n- And from the first guess, we know that the word has an \'A\' but not in position 3. However, now we know that \'A\' is in position 1, so that condition is satisfied.\n\nSince we have the first letter fixed as \'A\', we need to guess the remaining four letters.\n\nWe have eliminated many common letters. The available letters are the remaining consonants and vowels that haven\'t been tried.\n\nAvailable letters (from the alphabet, excluding the known absent ones: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U).\n\nSo, absent letters: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U.\n\nAvailable letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWe need to form a word starting with \'A\' and using only the available letters.\n\nCommon words starting with \'A\' without the forbidden letters:\n\n- ""APPLE"": but has P and L, but also E? E is forbidden. So no.\n- ""ANGRY"": has N and R? Both forbidden. No.\n- ""ALIEN"": has E and N? Forbidden. No.\n- ""ADIEU"": has E and U? Forbidden. No.\n\nLet\'s think of words starting with \'A\' and using only D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""ALPHA"": A, L, P, H, A -> but has two A\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have A in first, so the last A would be in position 5. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. However, we can try.\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: A (first), L, P, H, A (fifth). The available letters are fine (L, P, H are available). But we have two A\'s. We know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. So it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we might get ambiguous feedback if there is only one A? Actually, since the first A is correct, the last A might be marked as absent if not in the word, or present if it is.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without duplicate A to avoid confusion.\n\nOther words:\n\n- ""AMPLY"": A, M, P, L, Y -> all letters available. And distinct except? All distinct: A, M, P, L, Y.\n\n""AMPLY"" is a word meaning ""in an ample manner"".\n\n- ""APPLY"": but has P, P, L, Y? And A. But two P\'s? And E? No, ""apply"" is A, P, P, L, Y. But we have two P\'s. Also, no E. But we don\'t know about duplicates. And P is available.\n\nBut ""apply"" has two P\'s, which might complicate.\n\n- ""ALLY"": only 4 letters? No, we need 5.\n\n5-letter words:\n\n- ""ALIGN"": has G and N? N is forbidden. No.\n- ""ALIKE"": has E? Forbidden. No.\n- ""ALIVE"": has E? Forbidden. No.\n- ""ALOUD"": has O and U? Forbidden. No.\n- ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> but T is forbidden (from guess 2: T is x). So no.\n\nT is forbidden? From guess 2, T is marked x, so not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, O, U, B are forbidden.\n\nSo, in ""AMPLY"": A, M, P, L, Y. Check forbidden: M, P, L, Y are not in the forbidden list. And T is not in it. So okay.\n\nBut we must avoid T? Yes, T is forbidden.\n\nAnother word: ""APHID"": A, P, H, I, D. All available letters: P, H, I, D. And distinct.\n\n""Aphid"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""AVOID"": has O? Forbidden. No.\n\n""AXIAL"": has X, I, A, L. But two A\'s? And X and I and L are available. But we have A in first and fifth. So duplicate A.\n\n""AMISS"": A, M, I, S, S. Two S\'s? And M, I, S available.\n\nBut duplicate S.\n\nTo maximize information, we should prefer words with distinct letters.\n\nSo, ""APHID"" has distinct letters: A, P, H, I, D.\n\n""AMPLY"" has distinct letters: A, M, P, L, Y.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nWe can also consider ""ASKEW"": A, S, K, E, W -> but E is forbidden. No.\n\n""AZURE"": has U and E? Forbidden. No.\n\n""ANVIL"": has N? Forbidden. No.\n\nSo, let\'s choose between ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"".\n\nWe might also consider ""ALPHA"" but it has two A\'s.\n\nAnother one: ""ADAPT"": has D, A, P, T -> T is forbidden. No.\n\n""AGILE"": has E? Forbidden. No.\n\n""ALGAE"": has E? Forbidden. No.\n\n""ALMOND"": 6 letters? No.\n\nSo, 5-letter words: ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"" are candidates.\n\nWe can also consider ""WALTZ"": but doesn\'t start with A? We need to start with A.\n\nWe must start with A.\n\nAnother word: ""AWAIT"": has W, A, I, T -> but T is forbidden. And two A\'s? A in first and third? But T is forbidden.\n\n""AVAIL"": has V, A, I, L -> and two A\'s? A in first and third? But we have A in first, so the third A might be duplicate. And V, I, L are available.\n\nBut duplicate A.\n\nSimilarly, ""AORTA"": has O? Forbidden.\n\nSo, back to ""APHID"" and ""AMPLY"".\n\nWe can also consider ""ASHEN"": has E? Forbidden.\n\n""ASPEN"": has E? Forbidden.\n\n""AXIOM"": has O? Forbidden.\n\n""AZOIC"": has O and I? O forbidden.\n\n""ABYSS"": has B and Y, S, S? B forbidden.\n\nSo, I think ""APHID"" or ""AMPLY"" are good.\n\nLet\'s pick ""AMPLY"" because it has more common letters? M, P, L, Y.\n\nBut Y is less common at the end? But it\'s acceptable.\n\nWe can also consider ""AMBER"": has B and E? Forbidden.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""AMPLY"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: \n- A: we know is correct in position 1, so we expect a check for A.\n- Then we test M in position 2, P in position 3, L in position 4, Y in position 5.\n\nIf any of these are in the word, we get feedback.\n\nWe might also get information about duplicate A? But since we don\'t have another A, we won\'t.\n\nSo, guess: ""AMPLY""\n\nBut note: we have to output in the required format.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of other words.\n\nAnother word: ""AVID"": only 4 letters.\n\n""APISH"": A, P, I, S, H. All distinct and available: P, I, S, H.\n\n""APISH"" is a word (meaning resembling an ape).\n\nSimilarly, ""APHID"" and ""APISH"" are both good.\n\n""AMPLY"" is also good.\n\nI think any of these are fine. Let\'s choose ""APISH"" because it has S and H, which are common.\n\nBut we have no strong preference.\n\nWe can also consider ""ASKED"": has E? Forbidden.\n\n""ALPHS"": not a common word.\n\nI\'ll go with ""APHID"" for now.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have to make a guess.\n\nWe can also consider the frequency of letters.\n\nCommon letters left: S, L, I, P, M, D, etc.\n\nWe can try to cover more common ones.\n\n""APHID"" has P, H, I, D.\n\n""AMPLY"" has M, P, L, Y.\n\n""APISH"" has P, I, S, H.\n\nS is more common than D or Y, so ""APISH"" might be better.\n\nSimilarly, H is common.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""APISH"".\n\nBut we must start with A, so ""APISH"": A (position 1), P (2), I (3), S (4), H (5).\n\nWe know A is correct in position 1, so we are testing P, I, S, H.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""apish"".\n\nBut let\'s write it.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""ASHAM"" but that has two A\'s? A in first and fourth? And S, H, M. But ""asham"" is not a word? I think ""asham"" is not standard. ""ASHAM"" might be a name, but not common.\n\n""ASHEN"" has E.\n\nSo, ""APISH"" is valid.\n\nAnother common word: ""ASPIC"" but C is forbidden.\n\nSo, I think ""APISH"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the word: ""apish"" is an adjective meaning ""foolishly silly"" or ""resembling an ape"".\n\nIn Wordle, it might be in the dictionary.\n\nSimilarly, ""APHID"" is a noun.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI\'ll choose ""APISH"" to include S.\n\nSo, the guess is ""apish"".\n\nBut note: in the feedback, we will get:\n\n- A: ✓ (since we know it\'s correct in position 1)\n- P: ? \n- I: ?\n- S: ?\n- H: ?\n\nAnd we\'ll see which are present and in what positions.\n\nSo, <guess>apish</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Eliminated letters C, R, N, E (all marked ""x""), and confirmed A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").\n- **Guess 2 (""about"")**: Confirmed A is in position 1 (marked ""✓""), and eliminated B, O, U, T (all marked ""x"").\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Correct position**: A is the first letter (position 1).\n- **Eliminated letters**: B, C, E, N, O, R, T, U (cannot appear in the word).\n- **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- **Word structure**: Starts with A, followed by four letters from the available set. The word must be a valid English word.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Prioritize words starting with A and using common unused letters (e.g., S, L, I, P, M, H) to maximize information.\n- Avoid eliminated letters and duplicate letters for clearer feedback.\n- Test potential letters in new positions to narrow down possibilities.\n\nSelected guess: **""APISH""** (meaning ""foolishly silly"" or ""resembling an ape"").  \n- Why ""APISH""?  \n  - Starts with A (confirmed position 1).  \n  - Uses distinct, common available letters: P (position 2), I (position 3), S (position 4), H (position 5).  \n  - Tests high-frequency consonants (S, P, H) and a vowel (I), which could reveal more about the word\'s structure.  \n  - Avoids eliminated letters and duplicates.  \n\nThis guess will provide feedback on P, I, S, and H, helping to identify correct letters and their positions for the next guess.\n\n<guess>apish</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: apish -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) P(x) I(x) S(-) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: x (not in word)\n- A: - (in word, wrong position; specifically, not position 3)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""about""\n- A: ✓ (correct, position 1)\n- B: x (not in word)\n- O: x (not in word)\n- U: x (not in word)\n- T: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 3: ""apish""\n- A: ✓ (correct, position 1)\n- P: x (not in word)\n- I: x (not in word)\n- S: - (in word, wrong position; not position 4)\n- H: x (not in word)\n\nNow, combining all information:\n\n1.

Letters not in the word (eliminated): B, C, E, I, N, O, P, R, T, U, H.\n   - From guess 1: C, R, N, E\n   - From guess 2: B, O, U, T\n   - From guess 3: P, I, H\n   - So eliminated: B,C,E,H,I,N,O,P,R,T,U.\n\n3. Letters that are in the word:\n   - A is in the word and fixed at position 1.\n   - From guess 3, S is in the word (since we got a \'-\') but not in position 4.\n   - Additionally, from guess 1, A was marked as present but not in position 3. But now that position 1 is A, that is consistent.\n\nWe know the word must have S, and it cannot be in position 4 (from guess 3), and cannot be in position 1 (since position 1 is A). So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nAlso, we have eliminated many letters, so what\'s left?\n\nAvailable letters: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut S is already known to be in the word. So the word has at least two letters: A and S.\n\nThe word has positions: \nPosition 1: A\nPosition 2: ? (cannot be S if S is not in position 4, but S could be here? Wait, no restriction yet except the eliminated letters)\nActually, S can be in position 2, since we put S in position 4 and got \'-\', meaning S is in the word but not in 4. It could be in 2, 3, or 5.\n\nWe don\'t know if there are other letters.\n\nThe word might have more than two unique letters? But we only know A and S for sure.\n\nNow, we need to form a word that starts with A, includes S (in one of positions 2,3,5) and uses only available letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,S,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nAlso, we must avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nFor the next guess, we should:\n1. Keep A in position 1 (since it\'s correct).\n2. Include S in a new position to test: either 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 was wrong).\n   - We should try to place S in one of these positions to see if it fits.\n3. Fill the remaining positions with new common letters from the available set.\n\nWe have three possibilities for S: positions 2, 3, or 5.\n\nWe can prioritize testing S in position 2, for example.\n\nTo maximize information, we can choose a word with S in position 2 and distinct new letters.\n\nAvailable common letters: L, M, D, F, G, K, etc.\n\nNote: We have only 6 tries, and this is our fourth guess.\n\nWhat words start with A and have S in the second position?\n\nIf S is in position 2: A S _ _ _\n\nPossible words: \n- ""ASKEW"": but has E, which is eliminated? Yes, E is not allowed.\n- ""ASPIC"": has C? Eliminated.\n- ""ASSAY"": but has S twice? And A? We have A already in position 1, so if we put S in position 2, then S again in position 3? But we don\'t know if S appears multiple times. Also, \'A\' in position 5? But we have A fixed at position 1, and we don\'t know about duplicate A. However, ""assay"" has S and S, and A at the end? But position 1 is A, and if the word ends with A, that\'s possible? But in our feedback, when we had ""crane"", we had A as \'-\' meaning present but not position 3. And with ""apish"", we didn\'t have another A. So it\'s possible.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, we should test words without duplicates first.\n\nAnother word: ""ASHED"": has E? Eliminated.\n\n""ASKED"": has E and K? But E eliminated.\n\nSo no.\n\nWhat about S in position 3: A _ S _ _\n\nPossible words:\n- ""AEGIS"": has E? Eliminated.\n- ""ALIAS"": has L, I? I eliminated (from guess 3). Also, I is not allowed.\n- ""ABBAS"": has B? Eliminated.\n\nWithout eliminated letters:\n\nAvailable: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,S,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nSo, ""A?S??"" with ? from available.\n\nFor example:\n- ""AMASS"": A, M, A, S, S? But we have two A\'s? Position 1 is A, then position 3 is S? Position 5 is S? And M at position 2? Then position 4 is S? Actually, ""AMASS"" is A (1), M (2), A (3), S (4). But position 3 is A? We don\'t know if A is duplicated. Also, position 4 is S? But in guess 3, S was not in position 4 because we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not there. So S wouldn\'t be correct in position 4? Same reason? In guess 3, S was in position 4 and got \'-\', so S is not in position 4. Therefore, we cannot put S in position 4 again? We shouldn\'t.\n\nIn our next guess, if we put S in position 4, we expect a \'-\' again (if it\'s not correct, but we know it\'s not) so it doesn\'t help. So we should avoid position 4 for S.\n\nSo S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nTrying to form words with S in position 2: \n- Must be ""A S ? ? ?""\nLetters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (since S is used at position 2).\n\nAnd the word must have only one S? Not necessarily, but to avoid duplicates, we try one S.\n\nSo, ""AS..."" words without eliminated letters.\n\nPossible:\n- ""ASKEW"" no, E.\n- ""ASDIC"": has D, I? I eliminated? Wait, I is eliminated? From guess 3, I is marked x, so yes, not allowed.\n""ASDIC"": A,S,D,I,C? But C and I eliminated? And C is eliminated too? So no.\n\nAnother: ""ASWAY"" ? Not common.\n\n""ASKOI"": has O and I? Both eliminated? No.\n\n""ASKED"" no E.\n\nPerhaps no common words with S in position 2 without using eliminated letters.\n\nSimilarly, for S in position 3: ""A ? S ? ?""\n\nPossible:\n- ""AULOS"": has O and U? Eliminated.\n- ""AXIOM"": has O? Eliminated.\n- ""ADSES"": not a word.\n\nWithout eliminated letters.\n\nFor example: ""A G S V D"" ? Not a word.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""AGISM"": not common? Also, has I? Eliminated.\n- ""ALMES"": has E? Eliminated.\n\nIt\'s difficult.\n\nS in position 5: ""A ? ? ? S""\n\nSo positions: 1: A, 5: S.\n\nAnd 2,3,4 from available letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nBut we exclude S for the middle positions? Or we can have S again? But let\'s try without duplicate first.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""ADVWS""? Not a word.\n- ""AFARS"": but that\'s two S? ""afars"" is not common? ""AFARS"" might be a proper name? Not ideal.\n- ""AGARS"": same.\n\nCommon words ending with S: \n- ""ALIAS"": but has I? Eliminated.\n- ""AMASS"": we thought earlier, but has two S and two A? A at 1 and 3? S at 4 and 5? But we know S cannot be in 4? So in ""AMASS"", positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S? But position 4 is S, which we know is wrong because in guess 3 S was in position 4 and we got a \'-\', meaning it should not be in 4. So if we put S in 4 again, it will be \'-\'. Also, S in position 5 might be correct? However, ""AMASS"" has S in both 4 and 5? But if the word has two S, that\'s possible? And position 5 S might be correct? Position 1 A is correct. Position 3 A? We don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s see: ""AMASS"" has letters M and A? And S.\n\nBut M is available? Yes.\n\nAnother word: ""AWAITS""? Too long.\n\n5-letter: ""ASSES"": but starts with A, then S,S,E,S? But E eliminated. And two S.\n\n""APSES"": has E? Eliminated.\n\n""ALMES"": has E.\n\n""ABYES"": has B and E? Eliminated.\n\n""ACKES"": eliminated.\n\nHard to find a common word.\n\nBut we have ""DAILY"" but doesn\'t end with S? Not.\n\nAnother ending with S: ""ANODE"" eliminated.\n\nPerhaps ""LYAMS""? Doesn\'t start with A.\n\nWe consider words with duplicate letters? Or use S only once.\n\nList of words: \n- ""AZANS"": not common.\n\nI think we have to consider S in the other positions.\n\nAnother option: S in position 3.\n\nTry ""A_ S _ _"" \n\nWith available letters: for position 2: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z\nPosition 4 and 5: same set.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""ALAS"": only 4 letters.\n- ""ADSUM"": not 5.\n\n""AGAST"": has G,A,S,T? But T is eliminated? T is marked x in guess 2.\n\n""AGASP"": has G,A,S,P? But P eliminated? In guess 3, P is x.\n\nP is eliminated.\n\nSo, no T, no P.\n\nBut what about L? ""ALSAK""? Not a word.\n\n"" A L S D K""? No.\n\nPerhaps ""K"" at the end? ""ALCKS""? No.\n\nThink differently: include S in position 5, and use common letters for 2,3,4.\n\nAvailable letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nCommon combinations: use L, M, D.\n\nFor example: \n- ""ALLYS"": has L twice? And L and Y? But ""ALLY"" is 4, ""ALLYS"" might be a word? Or ""ALLOW"" but O and not S.\n- ""ALMYS"" no.\n\n""ASHED"" no E.\n\nPerhaps ""AWFUL"" but no S.\n\nWe need to include S? Only at the end or at position 3.\n\nLet\'s try a word with S in position 5: ""A _ _ _ S""\n\nCommon words: \n- ""ADIOS"": has D,I,O? O eliminated? O is from guess 2, eliminated. I eliminated.\n- ""ADVWS"" no.\n\n""AGERS"": has E? No.\n\n""AGLOW"": no S.\n\n""AKSES"": not common.\n\n""ALMES"": has E.\n\nIt\'s tricky.\n\nFocus on what other letters are likely.\n\nPerhaps the word has L or M.\n\nAnother idea: in guess 1, we had A as present but not in 3. But now position 1 is A, so that condition is satisfied. And S is in the word, not in 4.\n\nWe also have few letters available.\n\nPerhaps we missed a letter that is not eliminated? Like G, K, L, M, W, etc.\n\nWe can try to include such letters.\n\nOne word: ""AISLE"" but has I and E? Eliminated.\n\n""ACIDS"" has C and I? Eliminated.\n\n""ALIAS"" has I? Eliminated.\n\nBut we have to use only available letters.\n\nLet\'s list all possible 5-letter words starting with A, with S in the word (not position 4), and using only D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z, and S must be in 2,3, or 5.\n\nAssume S in position 5 for now.\n\nCommon words ending with S and starting with A, without eliminated letters:\n\n- ""AKAAS"" ? Not common.\n- ""ALGAS"": but has G, A, S? And L? Position 1: A,2: L,3: G,4: A,5: S? But we have A at 1 and 4? Duplicate A? And available letters: L,G,A are available? Except A is at 1, but A is in the set? Position 4 is A? We don\'t know. Also, ""ALGAS"" is a valid word (plural of alga?).\n\nBut sea plant? So it\'s a word.\n\nBut it has two A\'s: A at 1 and 4, and S at 5.\n\nAlso, letters L and G.\n\nWe can try ""ALGAS"".\n\nSimilarly, ""ARRAS"" has R? Eliminated.\n\n""ALMAS"" has M? All available? ""ALMAS"": A (1), L (2), M (3), A (4), S (5)? Again, two A\'s.\n\nOr ""ADVES"" not a word.\n\nAnother: ""AKSED"" has E.\n\nI think ""ALGAS"" or ""ALMAS"" are options.\n\nSimilarly, ""AWOLS"" has O? Eliminated.\n\n""AYESS"" not common.\n\nAmong ""ALGAS"" and ""ALMAS"", we can choose.\n\n""ALGAS"" might be less common, but it\'s in dictionaries.\n\n""ALMAS"" is a word in English? It can be plural of alma? alma mater, but not commonly used.\n\nPerhaps ""ALGAE"" but has E.\n\nOr ""AWDLS"" no.\n\nAnother common one: ""AWAYS"" has W and Y? But no S in position 5? ""AWAYS"" is A,W,A,Y,S? Position 5 S? S at 5. And letters W and Y available. But ""aways"" is an adverb? Not common in Wordle? But might be accepted.\n\nBut ""aways"" has two A\'s? A at 1 and 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""AWASH"" has S and H, but H is eliminated? From guess 3, H is x. So H not allowed.\n\nIn guess 3, H is x, so we cannot use H.\n\nSo for ""ALGAS"": G and L are available.\n\nG has not been used.\n\nSimilarly, for position where S is at 5, we can try.\n\nBut to try to test S in position 2 or 3.\n\nAnother attempt: S in position 3.\n\nWord: A ? S ? ?\n\nPosition 1: A, position 3: S.\n\nPosition 2,4,5: from available letters: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (no eliminated letters).\n\nAnd S is at 3, so not duplicate unless we add more S, but we avoid.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""AXLES"": has X,L,E? E eliminated.\n- ""AASKS"" duplicate A and S, not common.\n\n""ABSORB"" too long.\n\n"" A L S K S "" not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""AL S + two letters"".\n\nLike ""ALSO"" but 4 letters.\n\n""ALSYN"" not a word.\n\n"" ALSPH"" no.\n\nIt\'s very difficult to find.\n\nMaybe ""AMASS"" but S in position 5? Then position 4 is S? But we know S can\'t be in position 4.\n\nIn ""AMASS"", position 4 is S, which we know is wrong, so it will not be check. But position 5 S might be correct.\n\nBut let\'s consider it: ""AMASS"" has positions:\n1: A (correct)\n2: M\n3: A\n4: S (we know not correct)\n5: S\n\nIf the word is ""AMASS"", then in our feedback for position 4 S, we\'d get a \'-\' because it\'s in the word but only one more position? But there is another S at position 5. The feedback would be:\n- Position 4: if S is in the word but wrong position, we get \'-\', which is what we got in guess 3? But this is for a new guess.\n\nBut for now, we are guessing ""AMASS"", but we have to use only available letters.\n\nM is available? Yes.\n\nA is at position 1 and 3? Possible.\n\nBut let\'s use this as a guess.\n\nWe have other words like ""ASKED"" and ""ASHED"" but have eliminated letters.\n\nAnother word: ""ASHES"" has H and E? Eliminated.\n\nI think we must use a word that may have duplicate letters or use common available letters.\n\nPerhaps ""LAWNS"" doesn\'t start with A.\n\nLet\'s try to search for words with available letters.\n\nOne word: ""AARGH"" has R and G? R eliminated.\n\n""ABACS"" not common.\n\n""ABAYA"" has B and Y? B eliminated.\n\nIt\'s very limited.\n\nPerhaps we missed that some letters are not eliminated.\n\nEliminated letters are: B,C,E,H,I,N,O,P,R,T,U\n\nFrom feedback:\n- C, R, N, E from guess 1.\n- B, O, U, T from guess 2.\n- P, I, H from guess 3.\n\nSo total eliminated: B,C,E,H,I,N,O,P,R,T,U\n\nAvailable: A is already at 1, S is in the word, and: D,F,G,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nNow, S must be in position 2,3, or 5.\n\nFor example, a word like ""A S K G D"" not a word.\n\n""A G S D K"" not a word.\n\nCommon word: ""SALAD"" but that doesn\'t start with A? It does S A L A D? No, starts with S, but we need start with A? Oh.\n\nOther common words starting with A: ""ANnEX"" eliminated.\n\nPerhaps ""AGL"" ""agley"" not 5 letters.\n\n""AMaZE"" has E.\n\nI think we should consider ""ALGAS"" or ""ALMAS"".\n\n""ALGA "" is 4 letters. Plural is ""ALGAE"" or ""ALGAS""? Some dictionaries accept ""algas"" as the plural of alga, especially in context.\n\nSimilarly, ""ALMAS"" might be accepted? Or ""ALMEH"" but has H? Eliminated.\n\nAnother word: ""FATAL"" doesn\'t start with A.\n\nPerhaps ""AUDIO"" but we used about.\n\nLet\'s choose ""ALGAS"" a ""algas"" is the plural form in some contexts.\n\nOr ""AMASS"" is more common.\n\n""AMASS"" is a valid 5-letter word.\n\nIn ""AMASS"", the S is in positions 4 and 5? We know position 4 is not correct, so we expect a \'-\' for position 4 S in feedback. Position 5 S might be correct.\n\nBut we can guess ""amass"" to test.\n\nIf the word is ""AMASS"", then:\n- Position 1: A ✓\n- Position 2: M ?\n- Position 3: A ? (possibly duplicate)\n- Position 4: S (should be \'-\')\n- Position 5: S ( if this is the only correct S position, but in the word there are two S? Feedback might mark position 5 as \'S\' if it\'s the only correct one? But the word has two S, so position 4 S might be marked as \'-\', and position 5 S as \'✓\' if it\'s correct.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word with S in position 5 and no other S.\n\nFor example, ""AWAKE"" has E? No.\n\n""AWAVE"" not common.\n\n""ASDIC"" has I? No.\n\nI think ""ALGAS"" is a choice: ""ALGAS"" with positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:Gas? ""a-l-g-a-s"", so\npos1: A\npos2: L\npos3: G\npos4: A\npos5: S\n\nSo S in position 5.\n\nThis tests S at position 5.\n\nAnd we test L and G.\n\nAlso, there is A at position 4, so we test if there is a second A.\n\nSince we have feedback from guess 1 that A is in the word, but not position 3, and now at position 1, it is possible there is another A.\n\nIn guess 3, we had no other A, but that doesn\'t mean there isn\'t duplicate.\n\nSo  guess ""ALGAS"".\n\nOther options: ""ADMAN"" has D and M and N? N eliminated? From guess 1, N is eliminated.\n\n""ADZES"" has D,Z,E,S? E eliminated.\n\n""AFARA"" not common.\n\n""AG   a g a a s"" not.\n\nI think we have to go with ""ALGAS"" or ""AMASS"".\n\nBut ""AMASS"" has S in position 4, which we know is wrong, so it will give a \'-\' for position 4 S, no new information.\n\nWhereas ""ALGAS"" has S in position 5, which is a new position.\n\nAlso, if there is only one S in the word, then position 5 might be correct.\n\nSo for information, ""ALGAS"" is better because we are testing S in a new position (5).\n\nSimilarly, we can test L and G.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""ALGAS"".\n\nBut is it in the Wordle dictionary? It might be, as it\'s a valid if uncommon word.\n\nAnother common word: ""AXIAL"" but has X, I, A, L? but I eliminated? In guess 3, I is eliminated.\n\nSo ""AXIAL"" not allowed.\n\n""AYahs"" not 5 letters.\n\nSo I think ""ALGAS"" is a possible guess.\n\nPerhaps ""KALIM"" not start with A.\n\nOr ""MALMS"" not.\n\nSo, we\'ll guess ""ALGAS"".\n\nIn this guess:\n- A at 1: correct, so ✓\n- L at 2: we will see if in word\n- G at 3: see if in word\n- A at 4: we will see if duplicate A is present\n- S at 5: see if in word or correct position\n\nFeedback will tell us.\n\nSo, <guess>algas</guess>\n\nBut let\'s output.### Step-by-Step Thought Process\n\nI have the feedback from three previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  \n  - This eliminates C, R, N, E and confirms A is in the word but not in position 3.\n- **Guess 2 (""about"")**: A(✓), B(x), O(x), U(x), T(x)  \n  - Confirms A is in position 1 and eliminates B, O, U, T.\n- **Guess 3 (""apish"")**: A(✓), P(x), I(x), S(-), H(x)  \n  - Confirms A in position 1 (redundant but reinforces), eliminates P, I, H, and confirms S is in the word but not in position 4.\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Position 1 is fixed as A** (from Guess 2 ✓).\n- **S must be in the word** and is not in position 4 (from Guess 3 -). Therefore, possible positions for S are 2, 3, or 5.\n- **Eliminated letters (not in word)**: B, C, E, H, I, N, O, P, R, T, U (from all feedback).\n- **Available letters**: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z (S is confirmed in the word).\n- **Word structure**: Starts with A (position 1), and has S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5. The word may have duplicates, but we prioritize testing new positions and distinct letters for clarity.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- **Keep A in position 1** (fixed).\n- **Test S in a new position** to narrow down its location. Since S is not allowed in position 4 and was tested there in Guess 3, we prioritize position 5 for this guess (positions 2 and 3 can be tested later if needed).\n- **Fill remaining positions** with common unused available letters to maximize information (e.g., L, G for their frequency).\n- Choose a **valid English word** from available letters that fits constraints.\n- Avoid eliminated letters and minimize duplicates for clearer feedback (though duplicates may be necessary).\n\n### Word Selection:\n- Ideal candidate should: start with A, have S in position 5, and use available letters (e.g., L, G).\n- **Evaluated options**:\n  - ""ALGAS"": Valid 5-letter word meaning ""seaweeds"" (plural of alga). Structure: A (pos1), L (pos2), G (pos3), A (pos4), S (pos5).  \n    - Tests S in position 5 (new position).\n    - Tests L, G, and potential duplicate A (which is possible but not confirmed).\n    - Uses distinct common letters L and G.\n  - Alternatives like ""AMASS"" (A, M, A, S, S) were rejected because S is in position 4 (known incorrect, wasting a test), or ""ALIAS"" (has eliminated I).\n- **Why ""ALGAS""?**  \n  - Tests S in position 5, which could confirm if correct (✓) or rule it out (-/x).\n  - Introduces new letters L and G.\n  - If A in position 4 is correct (-/✓), it tells us about duplicates.\n  - Balances common letters (L, G) and valid structure within constraints.\n\n### Expected Feedback Insight:\nThe feedback will:\n- Confirm position 1 A (✓).\n- Reveal if S is in position 5 (✓/-/x) or wrong position (handling duplicates).\n- Provide data on L (pos2) and G (pos3), helping reduce possibilities for Guess 5.\n- Guide further guesses based on S’s position and new letter eliminations.\n\n<guess>algas</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: apish -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) P(x) I(x) S(-) H(x)\nGuess 4: algas -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) G(x) A(✓) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from Guess 4 (""algas""):
- A: ✓ (correct, position 1)
- L: x (not in the word)
- G: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct, position 4) -> This means there is a second A in position 4? But note: the word has two A's? 
  Specifically, we had A in position 1 (correct) and A in position 4 (correct). But the feedback for position 4 A is ✓, meaning the second A is in the correct position (pos4).
- S: - (in the word but not in position 5)

Wait, let's parse the feedback:
The guess was ""algas"": 
  Position 1: A -> ✓ (correct, as we knew)
  Position 2: L -> x (not in word)
  Position 3: G -> x (not in word)
  Position 4: A -> ✓ (correct! So position 4 is also A)
  Position 5: S -> - (meaning S is in the word but not in position 5)

But if the word has two A's? Position 1 and 4 are both A? 

And now, the letter S is still in the word but not in position 5.

We also know from guess 3: S is in the word but not in position 4. Now we know it's also not in position 5? But now in guess 4 we put S in position 5 and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not in position 5. So S is not in positions 4 or 5.

But the word must have S, so it must be in position 2 or 3? We only have positions 2 and 3 left since positions 1 and 4 are A? 

The word is: A _ _ A _

And S must be in the word, so in one of the positions 2,3, or 5. But we have positions 2 and 3 available? Position 5 is available? But we tried S in position 5 and got '-', so it's not there. Similarly, guess3 position4 S was '-'. Therefore, S must be in position 2 or 3.

Also, from the new feedback:
L: not in word
G: not in word

So we have more eliminated letters.

Now, updating eliminated and confirmed:

Confirmed:
- Position 1: A
- Position 4: A

So the word is: A _ _ A _ 

And we know S is in the word and must be in position 2 or 3? Because positions 4 and 5 are not S? But position 4 is now A, so S cannot be there. Position 5 we just tried and got '-', so S not in 5. Therefore, S must be in position 2 or 3.

But also, the word has at least two A's? Since A at 1 and 4? Could there be more? But we only have positions 2,3,5 left? Position 5 is not A? Not yet? We don't know.

However, we now have eliminated many letters.

Eliminated letters (total):
From guess1: C, R, N, E
From guess2: B, O, U, T
From guess3: P, I, H
From guess4: L, G

So eliminated: B,C,E,G,H,I,L,N,O,P,R,T,U

Available letters: D,F,J,K,M,Q,S,V,W,X,Y,Z

But S is in the word, so available for other positions: D,F,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

The word has exactly two A's? At positions 1 and 4? Then the other positions must be filled with distinct letters? Or duplicates? But we have three positions: 2,3,5.

One of them is S? Either position 2 or 3 is S, and position 5 is another letter.

But the word must have at least one S, and we don't know if there are duplicate S? But we tried S in two positions (4 and 5) and got '-', meaning it was present but not there? But it could be in two different positions? However, we have only positions 2 and 3 left? 

So we have a word: A X Y A Z, where:
- X and Y are the letters in positions 2 and 3? And one of X or Y or possibly both is S? But we know S is in the word? Actually, we know S is in the word? From guess3, we got S(-) (position4), meaning S is present? So yes, S must be in the word.

Since we have positions 2 and 3, and S must be in one of them? 

And Z is position 5.

Now, we have eliminated letters? We can't use eliminated letters.

Available letters: D,F,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (and S might be one of X or Y? But S is already in the word? So for positions 2,3,5, we need letters from available set, including S for positions 2 or 3.

But S is in the set? Yes.

So for next guess, we need:

- Position 2: could be S or another available letter? But must include S in position 2 or 3 to test? Actually, we know S is not in 4 or 5, so must be in 2 or 3.

We can make a guess that places S in position 2 and a common letter in position 3 and 5? To test.

We have only two positions for S? 2 or 3? But we also know the word has A at 1 and 4? So format: A ? ? A ? 

One of the ? in positions 2 or 3 must be S? But which one? We don't know.

So we can try one? We have two tries left? No, we have two more guesses? Since this is for guess 5? Total 6 tries.

We are at guess 5.

Possibilities:

- Either S is in position 2? Or in position 3?

So we should make a guess that distinguishes between these two possibilities? Or cover both? But if we guess a word that has S in position 2, then:

If correct: S in pos2? Then the other letters.

But if not, then S must be in position 3.

But we don't care? We just need to make a valid guess.

Alternatively, we can make a guess that has S in position 2? Or in position 3.

We don't know position 5 either? We need to guess a valid word that fits: A _ _ A _ and includes S? Either in position2 or position3? And uses available letters.

Possible words:

- ""ASSAY"": has S twice and Y? But positions: A(1), S(2), S(3), A(4), Y(5)? But we know S cannot be in position 2? Wait, no? But in this word, position 2 and 3 are S? But we have S in the word? And we haven't tested those positions? Also, ""assay"" has two S? And Y? Available letters include Y? But we have eliminated many.

Check eliminated letters? S in position2 and 3? And Y? But eliminated? No: available letters include S and Y? Yes.

But does the word have duplicates? Yes? But possible? In this word, positions: 
  Position 1: A (correct)
  Position 2: S (to be tested? Could be)
  Position 3: S (duplicate? And if S is in 2 or 3, can be? We know S is present? But not how many? Could be two?
  Position 4: A (correct)
  Position 5: Y (to be tested? Or if it's available?)

But in the word ""ASSAY"", positions 2 and 3 are both S? So if we put S in both 2 and 3, and if the secret word has S only once? Then one of them would be correct? And the other might be marked as 'x'? Or '-'. But we know S is in the word, so both might be marked as '-' or one '✓'?

But it's messy? Prefer a word with distinct letters.

But distinct for positions? Now, we have the available letters: D,F,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? And S? S can be in position 2 or 3.

But if S is in position 2, then position 3 must be a different letter? Similarly, if S is in position 3, position 2 must be a different letter? And position 5 must be a letter.

So we don't know which? So let's list possible words? Start with ""A"", then S or other? But position 2: either S or another available letter?

But if we put S in position 2, it could be correct? Or wrong? We don't know.

Similarly for position 3.

We can try a word with S in position 2 and test a common letter in position 3 and 5.

For example: ""ASKED"" has E? Eliminated? Cannot.

""A S K E D"" no.

Available letters: D,F,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? So we have K? M? etc.

Try ""A S K A Y""? But that would be ""ASKAY""? Not a word.

""A S M A D"" ? ""ASMAD""? Not.

Common words: ""ABACA"" eliminated B.

""D"" for position 5: ""A S D A M"" ""asdam""? No.

""V"" : ""A S V A W"" not a word.

It's difficult.

Try ""A M A S S""? We already did ""AMASS""? But that has two A's? But we know positions 1 and 4 are A? Position 5 S? But we got '-' for S in position5? In guess4.

But let's reconsider: the word could be ""AMASS"" but we would get different feedback? No, because in ""AMASS"", positions: A(1), M(2), A(3), S(4), S(5)? 

But in that case:
- Position 1: A ✓
- Position 2: M?
- Position 3: A? Which is not the confirmed A? Because the A at position 3 is extra? And we have A at position 4? But in ""AMASS"", position 4 is S? Not A? So that doesn't match.

We have position 4 confirmed as A? So the word has A at pos1 and pos4? So the fourth letter must be A? Whatever we guess for position4 must be A? We know that.

So the word has A at 1 and 4? So we have to have A in position 1 and 4? And S in either position 2 or 3? And the other position has a letter? And position 5 has a letter.

Now, one common word that fits: ""AWAIT""? But has W and I? I eliminated? ""await"" has I? Position 3 is I? Eliminated.

""AFRAY""? Not common.

Other word: ""AVA ?"" ""AVA S?""

""AVAIL"": has I? Eliminated.

""AVAST"" : has V and S? And T? T eliminated? So no.

""ASK"": too short.

Perhaps ""MASAS"" doesn't start with A.

Another word: ""AGAMA? 5 letters? ""AGAMA"" but has M? Positions A(1),G(2),A(3),M(4),A(5) but we need A at position4? Position4 is M? Not A? So position4 must be A? In our case.

That's not.

Let's list words with pattern A _ _ A _ and without eliminated letters.

For position3: one of D,F,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? And position2: same? But one of those must be S? Or position3? But we don't know? So we have to include S in one of position2 or position3? And for the other, a letter from available.

Position5: a letter from available.

Examples:
- If S in position2: ""A S ? A ?"" with '?' not in S? So? ""A S D A K"" ""asdak"" not a word.
- ""A S K A B"" eliminated? No B.

"" A S K A D"" not word.

"" A S M A L"" ""asmal""? Not.

""J"" : ""A S J A K"" not.

It's really hard?

Perhaps the word is ""AWA S E"" but E eliminated.

Wait, another common one: ""AWARE"" has E? Eliminated.

""AZANS"" not common.

Perhaps ""KA A S"" doesn't start with A.

Maybe we forgot that the available letters include S? But S is the one to be placed.

Think of standard words: one is ""ABACK"" eliminated.

""ABAFT"" eliminated.

""ADV"" not.

Perhaps ""AMAZON"" too long.

Short word: ""AJA"" only 3.

Another idea: ""ALALA"" not? Positions? A L A L A? But that would be A(1), L(2), A(3), L(4), A(5)? But position2 and4? But we have position4 as A? And position2 is L? But L is eliminated from guess4? Guess4 L x, so not.

Position2 cannot be L? Already eliminated.

Similarly, G eliminated.

So all letters in position2 and3 cannot be eliminated letters.

So we must use from available: D,F,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? And S? But S might be one of them.

Now, for position2 and3: we can use S only once? So for example, ""A S W A Y"" ""asway""? Not common? Or ""A S M A D"" not.

"" A S S A Y"" ""assay"": it's a word? Yes? ""ASSAY"" is a valid 5-letter word.

In ""ASSAY"": positions 
1: A
2: S
3: S
4: A
5: Y

So we have two S positions: 2 and 3? And we know position4 must be A, which is correct? Position5: Y.

This uses available letters: S and Y? Yes? Eliminated letters not used.

So we can guess ""ASSAY"".

If the secret word is ""ASSAY"", then:
- Position1: A ✓
- Position2: S ✓? If S is also in the word at position2? But the feedback might be... But if there are two S, and one is in position2, it might be ✓? And position3 S might be also correct? Or not? If the word has two S, then both could be marked correct.

But we don't know if the word has two S? However, we know S is in the word? But probably only one? Not necessarily.

Feedback for ""apish"": S was in position4 and got '-', meaning S is in the word but not in position4. It did not specify how many S are present, just that there is at least one S.

Similarly, for ""algas"": S in position5 and got '-', meaning there is at least one S, not in position5.

In ""ASSAY"", we have two S's. It is possible that the secret word has only one S? Then one of the positions would be marked as present or correct? 

But in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters in the guess and the secret word has fewer, then one gets marked in the correct position or as present? But we don't know.

But we have to make a guess.

If we guess ""ASSAY"", and the secret word has only one S, then:
- If that one S is in position2, then we get S in position2 as ✓? And position3 S would be marked as 'x' or '-'? But since there is only one S, and it's at position2, then position3 S shouldn't be there? So marked 'x'? And position5 Y might be in or out.

But it might give us information.

But we can also avoid that by using a word with one S? But position2 or3 can only have one S? Yeah.

But we must include S? So for example, ""A S D A Y"" not a word.

Or ""A S K A B"" not.

I think "" assay"" is a possibility? Or ""atlas"" has T and L? Eliminated.

Another: ""argus"" has R GU? Eliminated.

"" A M A S S"" - and we have A at 1 and 4? So ""A M A S S"" would be A(1), M(2), A(3), S(4), S(5) but position4 must be A? So we need to put A at position4? Not S? So that's not the pattern.

Similarly, ""assay"" has A at1 and4? So A(1), S(2), S(3), A(4), Y(5)? So position2 and3 are S? And we are ok? 

So we can try ""ASSAY"" as a guess? To test if there are two S's? Or just one? Position5 with Y.

But what if the secret word has S only in position3? Then we might get position2 S as '-' and position3 as '✓' etc.

But it's acceptable.

Or we can try ""ASKAD"" not a word.

Another common word: ""ABAYA"" but has B? Eliminated.

""AGAMA"" has position4 as M? Not be.

I think we have to go with ""ASSAY"".

So guess: ""ASSAY""

It's valid? Yes.

But also, we can try ""A S M A K"" not a word.

Or ""A S P A N"" eliminated.

So ""ASSAY"" is possible.

Or ""ASWAY"" no.

Or ""ASKED"" but E.

So I think ""assay"" is the way to go.

### Step-by-Step Thought Process

We have feedback from four guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - Eliminates C, R, N, E; confirms A is in the word but not in position 3.
- **Guess 2 (""about"")**: A(✓), B(x), O(x), U(x), T(x)  
  - Confirms A is in position 1; eliminates B, O, U, T.
- **Guess 3 (""apish"")**: A(✓), P(x), I(x), S(-), H(x)  
  - Confirms A in position 1; eliminates P, I, H; confirms S is in the word but not in position 4.
- **Guess 4 (""algas"")**: A(✓), L(x), G(x), A(✓), S(-)  
  - Confirms A in positions 1 and 4 (so the word has at least two A's); eliminates L, G; confirms S is in the word but not in position 5.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 1: A
  - Position 4: A
- **S must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 4 (from Guess 3) or 5 (from Guess 4), so S must be in position 2 or 3.
- **Eliminated letters (not in word)**: B, C, E, G, H, I, L, N, O, P, R, T, U (from all feedback).
- **Available letters**: D, F, J, K, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Word structure**: The word must be of the form A _ _ A _, with S in position 2 or 3, and position 5 filled with an available letter. No eliminated letters can be used.

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- **Keep A in positions 1 and 4** (confirmed correct).
- **Test S in position 2** (since position 3 is also possible, but this tests one option for S and provides information if S is here).
- **Fill position 3 and 5** with common available letters to maximize information.
- Choose a **valid English word** that fits the constraints.

### Word Selection:
- **Criteria**:
  - Start: A (pos1), S (pos2 as test), [available letter] (pos3), A (pos4), [available letter] (pos5).
  - Avoid duplicated letters not confirmed (S may or may not be duplicated, but position 3 is separate).
  - Prioritize common available letters like M, K, Y.
- **Options considered**:
  - ""ASKAY"": Not valid.
  - ""ASMAY"": Not valid.
  - ""ASSAY"": **Valid** (meaning ""examine or test""). Structure: A (1), S (2), S (3), A (4), Y (5).  
    - Tests S in position 2 (could be ✓/-) and position 3 (could be ✓/-/x).
    - Tests Y in position 5.
    - Uses available letters only.
### Why ""ASSAY""?
- Provides maximal information:
  - If S is in position 2, feedback may show ✓ (correct) or - (wrong position but in word).
  - If S is in position 3, feedback will reflect that.
  - Reveals if both S positions are correct (possible duplicate).
  - Tests Y (common letter) in position 5.
- This guess narrows down S's position for the final guess if needed.

<guess>assay</guess>",assay,"We have feedback from Guess 4 (""algas""):
- A: ✓ (correct, position 1)
- L: x (not in the word)
- G: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct, position 4) -> This means there is a second A in position 4? But note: the word has two A's? 
  Specifically, we had A in position 1 (correct) and A in position 4 (correct). But the feedback for position 4 A is ✓, meaning the second A is in the correct position (pos4).
- S: - (in the word but not in position 5)

Wait, let's parse the feedback:
The guess was ""algas"": 
  Position 1: A -> ✓ (correct, as we knew)
  Position 2: L -> x (not in word)
  Position 3: G -> x (not in word)
  Position 4: A -> ✓ (correct! So position 4 is also A)
  Position 5: S -> - (meaning S is in the word but not in position 5)

But if the word has two A's? Position 1 and 4 are both A? 

And now, the letter S is still in the word but not in position 5.

We also know from guess 3: S is in the word but not in position 4. Now we know it's also not in position 5? But now in guess 4 we put S in position 5 and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not in position 5. So S is not in positions 4 or 5.

But the word must have S, so it must be in position 2 or 3? We only have positions 2 and 3 left since positions 1 and 4 are A? 

The word is: A _ _ A _

And S must be in the word, so in one of the positions 2,3, or 5. But we have positions 2 and 3 available? Position 5 is available? But we tried S in position 5 and got '-', so it's not there. Similarly, guess3 position4 S was '-'. Therefore, S must be in position 2 or 3.

Also, from the new feedback:
L: not in word
G: not in word

So we have more eliminated letters.

Now, updating eliminated and confirmed:

Confirmed:
- Position 1: A
- Position 4: A

So the word is: A _ _ A _ 

And we know S is in the word and must be in position 2 or 3? Because positions 4 and 5 are not S? But position 4 is now A, so S cannot be there. Position 5 we just tried and got '-', so S not in 5. Therefore, S must be in position 2 or 3.

But also, the word has at least two A's? Since A at 1 and 4? Could there be more? But we only have positions 2,3,5 left? Position 5 is not A? Not yet? We don't know.

However, we now have eliminated many letters.

Eliminated letters (total):
From guess1: C, R, N, E
From guess2: B, O, U, T
From guess3: P, I, H
From guess4: L, G

So eliminated: B,C,E,G,H,I,L,N,O,P,R,T,U

Available letters: D,F,J,K,M,Q,S,V,W,X,Y,Z

But S is in the word, so available for other positions: D,F,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

The word has exactly two A's? At positions 1 and 4? Then the other positions must be filled with distinct letters? Or duplicates? But we have three positions: 2,3,5.

One of them is S? Either position 2 or 3 is S, and position 5 is another letter.

But the word must have at least one S, and we don't know if there are duplicate S? But we tried S in two positions (4 and 5) and got '-', meaning it was present but not there? But it could be in two different positions? However, we have only positions 2 and 3 left? 

So we have a word: A X Y A Z, where:
- X and Y are the letters in positions 2 and 3? And one of X or Y or possibly both is S? But we know S is in the word? Actually, we know S is in the word? From guess3, we got S(-) (position4), meaning S is present? So yes, S must be in the word.

Since we have positions 2 and 3, and S must be in one of them? 

And Z is position 5.

Now, we have eliminated letters? We can't use eliminated letters.

Available letters: D,F,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (and S might be one of X or Y? But S is already in the word? So for positions 2,3,5, we need letters from available set, including S for positions 2 or 3.

But S is in the set? Yes.

So for next guess, we need:

- Position 2: could be S or another available letter? But must include S in position 2 or 3 to test? Actually, we know S is not in 4 or 5, so must be in 2 or 3.

We can make a guess that places S in position 2 and a common letter in position 3 and 5? To test.

We have only two positions for S? 2 or 3? But we also know the word has A at 1 and 4? So format: A ? ? A ? 

One of the ? in positions 2 or 3 must be S? But which one? We don't know.

So we can try one? We have two tries left? No, we have two more guesses? Since this is for guess 5? Total 6 tries.

We are at guess 5.

Possibilities:

- Either S is in position 2? Or in position 3?

So we should make a guess that distinguishes between these two possibilities? Or cover both? But if we guess a word that has S in position 2, then:

If correct: S in pos2? Then the other letters.

But if not, then S must be in position 3.

But we don't care? We just need to make a valid guess.

Alternatively, we can make a guess that has S in position 2? Or in position 3.

We don't know position 5 either? We need to guess a valid word that fits: A _ _ A _ and includes S? Either in position2 or position3? And uses available letters.

Possible words:

- ""ASSAY"": has S twice and Y? But positions: A(1), S(2), S(3), A(4), Y(5)? But we know S cannot be in position 2? Wait, no? But in this word, position 2 and 3 are S? But we have S in the word? And we haven't tested those positions? Also, ""assay"" has two S? And Y? Available letters include Y? But we have eliminated many.

Check eliminated letters? S in position2 and 3? And Y? But eliminated? No: available letters include S and Y? Yes.

But does the word have duplicates? Yes? But possible? In this word, positions: 
  Position 1: A (correct)
  Position 2: S (to be tested? Could be)
  Position 3: S (duplicate? And if S is in 2 or 3, can be? We know S is present? But not how many? Could be two?
  Position 4: A (correct)
  Position 5: Y (to be tested? Or if it's available?)

But in the word ""ASSAY"", positions 2 and 3 are both S? So if we put S in both 2 and 3, and if the secret word has S only once? Then one of them would be correct? And the other might be marked as 'x'? Or '-'. But we know S is in the word, so both might be marked as '-' or one '✓'?

But it's messy? Prefer a word with distinct letters.

But distinct for positions? Now, we have the available letters: D,F,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? And S? S can be in position 2 or 3.

But if S is in position 2, then position 3 must be a different letter? Similarly, if S is in position 3, position 2 must be a different letter? And position 5 must be a letter.

So we don't know which? So let's list possible words? Start with ""A"", then S or other? But position 2: either S or another available letter?

But if we put S in position 2, it could be correct? Or wrong? We don't know.

Similarly for position 3.

We can try a word with S in position 2 and test a common letter in position 3 and 5.

For example: ""ASKED"" has E? Eliminated? Cannot.

""A S K E D"" no.

Available letters: D,F,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? So we have K? M? etc.

Try ""A S K A Y""? But that would be ""ASKAY""? Not a word.

""A S M A D"" ? ""ASMAD""? Not.

Common words: ""ABACA"" eliminated B.

""D"" for position 5: ""A S D A M"" ""asdam""? No.

""V"" : ""A S V A W"" not a word.

It's difficult.

Try ""A M A S S""? We already did ""AMASS""? But that has two A's? But we know positions 1 and 4 are A? Position 5 S? But we got '-' for S in position5? In guess4.

But let's reconsider: the word could be ""AMASS"" but we would get different feedback? No, because in ""AMASS"", positions: A(1), M(2), A(3), S(4), S(5)? 

But in that case:
- Position 1: A ✓
- Position 2: M?
- Position 3: A? Which is not the confirmed A? Because the A at position 3 is extra? And we have A at position 4? But in ""AMASS"", position 4 is S? Not A? So that doesn't match.

We have position 4 confirmed as A? So the word has A at pos1 and pos4? So the fourth letter must be A? Whatever we guess for position4 must be A? We know that.

So the word has A at 1 and 4? So we have to have A in position 1 and 4? And S in either position 2 or 3? And the other position has a letter? And position 5 has a letter.

Now, one common word that fits: ""AWAIT""? But has W and I? I eliminated? ""await"" has I? Position 3 is I? Eliminated.

""AFRAY""? Not common.

Other word: ""AVA ?"" ""AVA S?""

""AVAIL"": has I? Eliminated.

""AVAST"" : has V and S? And T? T eliminated? So no.

""ASK"": too short.

Perhaps ""MASAS"" doesn't start with A.

Another word: ""AGAMA? 5 letters? ""AGAMA"" but has M? Positions A(1),G(2),A(3),M(4),A(5) but we need A at position4? Position4 is M? Not A? So position4 must be A? In our case.

That's not.

Let's list words with pattern A _ _ A _ and without eliminated letters.

For position3: one of D,F,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? And position2: same? But one of those must be S? Or position3? But we don't know? So we have to include S in one of position2 or position3? And for the other, a letter from available.

Position5: a letter from available.

Examples:
- If S in position2: ""A S ? A ?"" with '?' not in S? So? ""A S D A K"" ""asdak"" not a word.
- ""A S K A B"" eliminated? No B.

"" A S K A D"" not word.

"" A S M A L"" ""asmal""? Not.

""J"" : ""A S J A K"" not.

It's really hard?

Perhaps the word is ""AWA S E"" but E eliminated.

Wait, another common one: ""AWARE"" has E? Eliminated.

""AZANS"" not common.

Perhaps ""KA A S"" doesn't start with A.

Maybe we forgot that the available letters include S? But S is the one to be placed.

Think of standard words: one is ""ABACK"" eliminated.

""ABAFT"" eliminated.

""ADV"" not.

Perhaps ""AMAZON"" too long.

Short word: ""AJA"" only 3.

Another idea: ""ALALA"" not? Positions? A L A L A? But that would be A(1), L(2), A(3), L(4), A(5)? But position2 and4? But we have position4 as A? And position2 is L? But L is eliminated from guess4? Guess4 L x, so not.

Position2 cannot be L? Already eliminated.

Similarly, G eliminated.

So all letters in position2 and3 cannot be eliminated letters.

So we must use from available: D,F,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? And S? But S might be one of them.

Now, for position2 and3: we can use S only once? So for example, ""A S W A Y"" ""asway""? Not common? Or ""A S M A D"" not.

"" A S S A Y"" ""assay"": it's a word? Yes? ""ASSAY"" is a valid 5-letter word.

In ""ASSAY"": positions 
1: A
2: S
3: S
4: A
5: Y

So we have two S positions: 2 and 3? And we know position4 must be A, which is correct? Position5: Y.

This uses available letters: S and Y? Yes? Eliminated letters not used.

So we can guess ""ASSAY"".

If the secret word is ""ASSAY"", then:
- Position1: A ✓
- Position2: S ✓? If S is also in the word at position2? But the feedback might be... But if there are two S, and one is in position2, it might be ✓? And position3 S might be also correct? Or not? If the word has two S, then both could be marked correct.

But we don't know if the word has two S? However, we know S is in the word? But probably only one? Not necessarily.

Feedback for ""apish"": S was in position4 and got '-', meaning S is in the word but not in position4. It did not specify how many S are present, just that there is at least one S.

Similarly, for ""algas"": S in position5 and got '-', meaning there is at least one S, not in position5.

In ""ASSAY"", we have two S's. It is possible that the secret word has only one S? Then one of the positions would be marked as present or correct? 

But in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters in the guess and the secret word has fewer, then one gets marked in the correct position or as present? But we don't know.

But we have to make a guess.

If we guess ""ASSAY"", and the secret word has only one S, then:
- If that one S is in position2, then we get S in position2 as ✓? And position3 S would be marked as 'x' or '-'? But since there is only one S, and it's at position2, then position3 S shouldn't be there? So marked 'x'? And position5 Y might be in or out.

But it might give us information.

But we can also avoid that by using a word with one S? But position2 or3 can only have one S? Yeah.

But we must include S? So for example, ""A S D A Y"" not a word.

Or ""A S K A B"" not.

I think "" assay"" is a possibility? Or ""atlas"" has T and L? Eliminated.

Another: ""argus"" has R GU? Eliminated.

"" A M A S S"" - and we have A at 1 and 4? So ""A M A S S"" would be A(1), M(2), A(3), S(4), S(5) but position4 must be A? So we need to put A at position4? Not S? So that's not the pattern.

Similarly, ""assay"" has A at1 and4? So A(1), S(2), S(3), A(4), Y(5)? So position2 and3 are S? And we are ok? 

So we can try ""ASSAY"" as a guess? To test if there are two S's? Or just one? Position5 with Y.

But what if the secret word has S only in position3? Then we might get position2 S as '-' and position3 as '✓' etc.

But it's acceptable.

Or we can try ""ASKAD"" not a word.

Another common word: ""ABAYA"" but has B? Eliminated.

""AGAMA"" has position4 as M? Not be.

I think we have to go with ""ASSAY"".

So guess: ""ASSAY""

It's valid? Yes.

But also, we can try ""A S M A K"" not a word.

Or ""A S P A N"" eliminated.

So ""ASSAY"" is possible.

Or ""ASWAY"" no.

Or ""ASKED"" but E.

So I think ""assay"" is the way to go.### Step-by-Step Thought Process

We have feedback from four guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - Eliminates C, R, N, E; confirms A is in the word but not in position 3.
- **Guess 2 (""about"")**: A(✓), B(x), O(x), U(x), T(x)  
  - Confirms A is in position 1; eliminates B, O, U, T.
- **Guess 3 (""apish"")**: A(✓), P(x), I(x), S(-), H(x)  
  - Confirms A in position 1; eliminates P, I, H; confirms S is in the word but not in position 4.
- **Guess 4 (""algas"")**: A(✓), L(x), G(x), A(✓), S(-)  
  - Confirms A in positions 1 and 4 (so the word has at least two A's); eliminates L, G; confirms S is in the word but not in position 5.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 1: A
  - Position 4: A
- **S must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 4 (from Guess 3) or 5 (from Guess 4), so S must be in position 2 or 3.
- **Eliminated letters (not in word)**: B, C, E, G, H, I, L, N, O, P, R, T, U (from all feedback).
- **Available letters**: D, F, J, K, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Word structure**: The word must be of the form A _ _ A _, with S in position 2 or 3, and position 5 filled with an available letter. No eliminated letters can be used.

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- **Keep A in positions 1 and 4** (confirmed correct).
- **Test S in position 2** (since position 3 is also possible, but this tests one option for S and provides information if S is here).
- **Fill position 3 and 5** with common available letters to maximize information.
- Choose a **valid English word** that fits the constraints.

### Word Selection:
- **Criteria**:
  - Start: A (pos1), S (pos2 as test), [available letter] (pos3), A (pos4), [available letter] (pos5).
  - Avoid duplicated letters not confirmed (S may or may not be duplicated, but position 3 is separate).
  - Prioritize common available letters like M, K, Y.
- **Options considered**:
  - ""ASKAY"": Not valid.
  - ""ASMAY"": Not valid.
  - ""ASSAY"": **Valid** (meaning ""examine or test""). Structure: A (1), S (2), S (3), A (4), Y (5).  
    - Tests S in position 2 (could be ✓/-) and position 3 (could be ✓/-/x).
    - Tests Y in position 5.
    - Uses available letters only.
### Why ""ASSAY""?
- Provides maximal information:
  - If S is in position 2, feedback may show ✓ (correct) or - (wrong position but in word).
  - If S is in position 3, feedback will reflect that.
  - Reveals if both S positions are correct (possible duplicate).
  - Tests Y (common letter) in position 5.
- This guess narrows down S's position for the final guess if needed.",Guess 5: assay -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) S(✓) S(✓) A(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
