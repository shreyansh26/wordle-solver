We are making the first guess. Since we have no information, we want a word that maximizes information gain.
 Common starting words include those with many common letters and minimal repetition.
 Let's choose a word with 5 distinct letters that include common vowels and consonants.

 Good starting words: ""CRATE"", ""ROATE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

 After considering, I'll go with ""CRATE"" as it is a popular choice and covers common letters C, R, A, T, E.

 So the first guess is ""CRATE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRATE"":
C -> x (not in the word)
R -> x (not in the word)
A -> x (not in the word)
T -> x (not in the word)
E -> ✓ (correct and in the correct position)

So, we know:
- E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
- None of C, R, A, T are in the word.

Since E is at position 5, the secret word ends with E.

Now, for the next guess, we should:
- Avoid using C, R, A, T again because they are not in the word.
- Include other letters to test common vowels and consonants.
- Keep E in the fifth position because we know it's correct.

Given that E is fixed at position 5, we can form a new word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, T.
- Has E at the end.

Common letters remaining: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to gain more information. We might try a word with common letters that haven't been tested yet, such as S, O, L, I, N, etc.

A good candidate might be a word that ends in E and uses common letters that are still possibilities.

Let's list some words ending with E:
- ""SLIDE"": S, L, I, D, E -> But D might not be the best because we have a vowel I and S, L.
- ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> This uses common letters.
- ""HOUSE"": H, O, U, S, E -> U is less common? But S, O, H are common.
- ""QUINE"": Q is rare? Avoid.
- ""SPINE"": S, P, I, N, E -> This also looks good.

Considering common starting words and avoiding the excluded letters (C, R, A, T), we can try:

Option 1: ""NOISE"" -> letters: N, O, I, S, E (with E at the end)
Option 2: ""SPINE"" -> S, P, I, N, E
Option 3: ""SHINE"" -> S, H, I, N, E
Option 4: ""OUNCE"" -> but OUNCE has C? Wait, we cannot use C because it was excluded. So no.

""NOISE"" seems good because it introduces N, O, I, S, and we know E is fixed.

We might also consider ""QUERY"", but Q is less common and we don't want to use rare letters.

Alternatively, ""OPINE"" (meaning to express an opinion) has O, P, I, N, E.

But let me check commonality: ""NOISE"" is a common word.

So I'll go with ""NOISE"".

Remember: We need to avoid C, R, A, T and ensure E is at the fifth position.

So our next guess: ""NOISE""

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"":
- E is confirmed in the word and correctly positioned at the end (5th letter).
- C, R, A, and T are not in the secret word.

For the next guess:
- I must preserve the known ""E"" in the 5th position.
- I should avoid using C, R, A, T since they are excluded.
- I’ll prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, O, N, I) to maximize information gain.

A word fitting these criteria is **""NOISE""**:

- Uses new common letters: N, O, I, S.

We have previous feedback:
- Guess 1: CRATE -> C(x), R(x), A(x), T(x), E(✓)
  - This means E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter). C, R, A, T are not in the word at all.
- Guess 2: NOISE -> N(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), E(✓)
  - N, O, S are not in the word (x). I is in the word but in the wrong position (-). E is correctly placed (✓).

Key information:
1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. Letters not in the word: C, R, A, T, N, O, S.
3. I is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in NOISE, I was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning it's present but misplaced).

From Guess 2, I is in the word but not at position 4. Since position 5 is E, I can be in positions 1,2,3.

We know the word is 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E

Letters we must avoid (since they are not in the word): A, C, R, T, N, O, S.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we know I is in the word, so we must include I in one of the first three positions.

Now, we need to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Includes I (but not at position 4, so either 1,2 or 3)
- Does not contain A, C, R, T, N, O, S
- Uses other common letters to test more letters.

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 3.

We can think of words like:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E (e.g., ""IMPEL"", but M and P are not tested yet)
- Position 2: _ I _ _ E (e.g., ""QUITE"", but Q and U are less common)
- Position 3: _ _ I _ E (e.g., ""BELLE"", but E is repeated? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible, but we haven't encountered any evidence yet.)

However, we must avoid the excluded letters.

Let's brainstorm words ending in E and including I, without A,C,R,T,N,O,S.

Some options:
- ""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E -> T is excluded (from first guess, T(x)), so not allowed. Also T is excluded.
- ""EXILE"": E,X,I,L,E -> This has E at start and end? But E is known to be at the end. Also, it uses E twice? And we don't know if E is duplicated. Also, X and L are new.
  However, ""EX"" starts with E, but we don't know if E is at start? In first guess, position 1 was C(x), but that was rejected. We don't have information about E at start.

But note: In ""EXILE"", if we put it, the first E would be in position 1. Since in previous guesses E was only correct at position 5, position 1 E might not be correct or even present? We don't know.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: EXILE: E, X, I, L, E. Letters: E, X, I, L. Note T is not present, and excluded letters are A,C,R,T,N,O,S, so E,X,I,L are all allowed? We haven't tested X or L.

But ""EXILE"" has E in first position: we don't know if E is duplicated. Also, since we got E(✓) only at position 5, if E were at position 1 also, then in Guess 1 (CRATE) we would have E at position 5 correct, but the first E if present would have shown as (-) or (x) in CRATE? Actually, CRATE had E at position 5 correct, but if there were an E at position 1, CRATE didn't have E at position 1 (it had C), so we wouldn't know.

In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky. But we know E is at position 5. If there is another E, it might be in another position. We haven't tested E in other positions yet.

But in Guess 2: NOISE had E only at position 5? Yes, and it got ✓. The other positions were N,O,I,S which are all not E. So we don't know about other E's.

To be safe, we can assume the word might have duplicate E? But let's look for words without duplicates for now.

Another idea: Since I must be in positions 1,2, or 3, and we want to test more common letters.

List of available consonants and vowels: available vowels are I (since we haven't tested others except O and A excluded, so E is the only vowel we know). Available vowels: E (known at end), I (inside), and others: U, Y? And consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

Now, we can try a word that puts I in a different position than 4 and tests common consonants.

For example, consider ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E
- Ends with E
- Has I at position 3? G-U-I-L-E: positions: 1-G, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-E.
But we know from previous feedback that I is in the word, but cannot be at position 4? In NOISE, I was at position 4? Let me check:

Word: NOISE
N-1, O-2, I-3, S-4, E-5? Wait, no: NOISE is 5 letters: position 1: N, 2: O, 3: I, 4: S, 5: E.

In the feedback for NOISE, I was position 3? But the feedback says I(-), meaning I is in the word but not in position 3? Wait, let's clarify:

The feedback for NOISE: N(x) for position1, O(x) for position2, I(-) for position3, S(x) for position4, E(✓) for position5.

So for I, it was given that it's present but not at position 3. Therefore, I must be in the word but not in position 3. Hence, I cannot be at position 3? But that contradicts because in NOISE we guessed I at position 3 and got ""-"", which means it is in the word but not that position? So I must be somewhere else, but not at position 3.

Therefore, I can be at position 1, 2, or 4? But position 4 is currently occupied by S in NOISE, but S is excluded. And position 5 is E which is fixed.

Recall the secret word: _ _ _ _ E

In NOISE, we had I at position 3. Feedback for I: ""-"" meaning I is in the word but not at position 3.

Therefore, I must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 4.

But position 4: we don't know what letter is there. And I could be at position 4? But in secret word, position 4 is the fourth letter.

So, I must be in the secret word at position 1, 2, or 4.

Also, avoid letters: A,C,R,T,N,O,S.

So, for the next guess, we can try to put I at a different position to narrow down.

Possible strategies:

1. Try I at position 1: e.g., ""IMPEL""
   - I (at start) then M,P,E,L but E is at end? ""IMPEL"" would be I,M,P,E,L -> positions: 1-I, 2-M, 3-P, 4-E, 5-L -> but we need E at position 5? No, ""IMPEL"" ends with L? Not E. So invalid.

Words ending with E and starting with I? E.g., ""IMAGE"" -> I, M, A, G, E -> but A is excluded? A is forbidden. Cannot use.

""INLET"" -> N excluded? N in first guess? N was excluded in Guess 2? N(x) in NOISE, so excluded.

""QUITE"" -> T excluded.

""ISLET"" -> S excluded? And T excluded. Not good.

Let's try I at position 2: e.g., ""QUITE"" -> Q,U,I,T,E -> T excluded? T(x) from first guess? First guess: CRATE T(x), so T is excluded. Can't use.

""DIETS"" -> D,I,E,T,S -> T and S excluded? No.

""BIKED"" -> B,I,K,E,D -> ends with D? Not E. We need word ending with E.

We need words like _ I _ _ E? But position 4 must be filled.

Examples: 
- ""TITLE"" -> T excluded? T is forbidden -> No.
- ""FILEE"" -> not a word? File? But letters: F,I,L,E,E? We don't know if duplicates allowed? And E would be at end? ""FILE"" is 4 letters? Doesn't work.

Let me think ""ALIVE"" -> A excluded? A is forbidden.

""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> ends with E? Yes. Letters: G,U,I,L,E -> I at position 3? But we are considering I at position 2? ""GUILE"": G-1, U-2, I-3, L-4, E-5 -> so I at position 3? But we know I cannot be at position 3? Because in Guess 2, I at position 3 got ""-"", meaning I cannot be at position 3. Therefore, we cannot put I at position 3 again? Or can we? We can, but we know it's wrong position? Actually, we know I is in the word but not at position 3.

But if the secret word had I at position 3, then in NOISE, it would have been ""✓""? But it was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So I cannot be at position 3.

Therefore, in GUILE, if we put I at position 3, we expect ""-"" again only if I is not at 3, which we already know? This wouldn't give new information. But maybe we can test other letters.

But better to test a position where I might be.

We need to test either position 1 or 2 or 4? Position 4 is available? In secret word, position 4 must be a letter. Since E is at 5, we can try I at position 4.

But also position 1 and 2 are possible?

So, we can try a word with I at position 4? Or at position 1? Or position 2.

Given that, let's construct a word:

Option: Put I at position 4? So word: _ _ _ I E? But then the word ends with IE? And what about position 1,2,3.

Example: ""MOVIE"" -> M,O,V,I,E -> O? O is excluded? From NOISE O(x), excluded.

""DAZIE"" word? Not common. Or ""BIZIE"" no.

Another: ""TEPID"" -> doesn't end with E.

Words ending with IE? Like ""MOVIE"" -> O excluded? ""VIE""? too short.

""PLAZE"" not word? Or ""BEZIE"" not common.

Better: use common words.

Perhaps put I at position 1: e.g., ""Icing"" but that's 5 letters? ""ICING"" not ends with E? ""ICED"" not 5 letters.

""IDELE"" not word? 

Common word: ""IMAGE"" but A excluded? Not.

Another: ""INVITE"" -> N and T excluded? N excluded.

Perhaps we should avoid position 1 if we can't find.

Maybe try position 2: _ I _ _ E

Example: ""WHITE"" -> W,H,I,T,E -> T excluded? Forbidden.

""BRIDE"" -> B,R,I,D,E -> R excluded? R from first guess R(x), excluded? Cannot.

""Guide"" G,U,I,D,E -> D? But we haven't tested D. Letters: G,U,I,D,E? And U is vowel.

""GUILE"" as before, but I at position 3? Which we know is incorrect? But maybe we can test other letters.

Given the difficulty, let's list words ending with E that contain I and exclude known banned letters, and have I at position 1,2, or 4.

Position 1: I _ _ _ E:
- ""IXNIE"" not word.
- ""IMPEE"" not word.
- Hard to find common words. I'll skip.

Position 2: _ I _ _ E:
- ""QUITE"" -> Q and U and T excluded? T excluded.
- ""PIECE"" -> P,I,E,C,E -> C excluded? E repeated? And C forbidden.
- ""SIEGE"" -> S excluded.
- ""LIEGE"" -> L,I,E,G,E -> E repeated? Ends with E. But S? no S.
  Letters: L,I,E,G,E? But L is allowed. But it has two E's? Possible.

But ""LIEGE"" (a place) has positions: L-1, I-2, E-3, G-4, E-5? Then E at position 3? And E at position 5. Since we know E at position 5 is correct, but position 3 E might be additional? But we don't know.

But if we try ""LIEGE"", we will test:
- Position 1: L? Not tested before.
- Position 2: I? If I is in the word, but at position 2? We don't know.
- Position 3: E? (but we know E is only known to be at 5, might not be elsewhere)
- Position 4: G? New.
- Position 5: E known.

However, in Guess 2 (NOISE) we tested I at position 3 and got ""-"", so if I is at position 2, then in LIEGE, we put I at position 2, which could be correct? So feedback might show I as ""✓"" if it is position 2? Or ""-"" if it is elsewhere.

But let's see the banned letters: LIEGE contains L,I,E,G,E. E is allowed? We know E at 5 is in, but we can use E elsewhere? And the letters are L,I,E,G, no banned.

So ""LIEGE"" could work? But:

It tests L and G? That's fine.

Then position 4: G? If we get feedback on G.

However, we have E at position 3: if E is not in the word elsewhere except position 5, it will get x or -? Since it is present, but position 3 might be wrong? If no duplicate, it will be ""-"" but only if E is just at position 5? But we might have duplicates.

So it may not be ideal.

Another word: ""AGILE"" -> A excluded? Not.

""UTILE"" -> U,T excluded? T is excluded? From Guess1.

""ELIDE"" -> E,L,I,D,E
- Positions: E-1, L-2, I-3, D-4, E-5

We know E is at position 5? But position 1 E is unknown. I at position 3? But we know I cannot be at position 3? So we'll get ""-"" for I since it's at 3? But we already know that.

Letters: E,L,I,D,E? Avoids banned letters? Yes.

But E at position 1: it might be in the word or not? If not, it will be x, but if it is, it might be ✓ or -.

Also, it has two E's, so if the secret word has only one E, at position 5, then position 1 E will be x.

If dual E, then it might be - or ✓.

So ""ELIDE"" might work? But let's see.

Another word: ""QUINE"" -> Q and U? And N excluded? NO, N is excluded? From Guess2: N(x) excluded? Yes.

Not good.

""DWINE"" -> D,W,I,N,E -> N excluded? Excluded.

""JUMPE"" not word? 

""CHILE"" -> C excluded? No.

""THIEF"" -> T excluded? And not ends with E.

Perhaps ""BUILD"" but not E.

I think ""GUILE"" might be good: G,U,I,L,E? With I at position 3? But we know I not at position 3? So:

Word GUILE: G1, U2, I3, L4, E5.

Since we know I is not at position 3 (from previous), then for I we expect ""-"" again if I is elsewhere? Which doesn't help? But perhaps we get new information about U, G, L.

Similarly, for E, position 5 is correct? We know that.

So it's not bad? But we might not know about I.

But we can use a word that has I at position 4? Since position 4 is a possibility.

e.g., ""BEVIE"" not word? ""MOVIE"" O excluded? ""WIVIE"" not word.

""PIXIE"" -> P,I,X,I,E? Positions: P-1, I-2, X-3, I-4, E-5? Then it has I at position 2 and 4? We can test position 4.

But it has I at position 2? And we don't forbid I at other positions.

""PIXIE"": P,I,X,I,E? That's a word? P-I-X-I-E? Yes, it refers to a pixie.

Letters: P,I,X,I,E? Two I's? We haven't tested duplicates, so it's possible, but complicated? Also, P,X are new.

And avoid banned: A,C,R,T,N,O,S are banned? P,X,I,E not banned? I and E are allowed? Yes.

So ""PIXIE"" could be an option? But it has two I's? Then feedback might be confusing? But let's see how.

But to simplify, let's pick a word with I at position 1? Must end with E? How about ""IVIES"" but ends with S? Not E. ""IVIED"" not 5 letters? Not ends with E.

""ILEUM"" but not ends with E? ""ILEUS"" ends with S? Not.

We might have to compromise on the position.

But note: position 4 for I: in secret word, position 4 could be I? Then we can test.

Consider ""VAGUE"" -> V,A,G,U,E -> A excluded? No.

""HAVOC"" not E.

I think a good word is ""QUIET"" -> Q,U,I,E,T -> T excluded? And no E at end? Not.

Wait: ""MOIRE"" -> O excluded? Excluded.

Another: ""BAIME"" not word.

Perhaps ""PULSE"" -> S? S excluded.

We have to remove S in 2nd guess.

Give up: let's use ""GUILE"" for the guess. We test G,U,L? And see the I at position 3, which should give ""-"", but we already know that? And we also have E at correct position.

Alternatively, ""ELIDE"" we thought: E at position 1? L at position 2? I at position 3 (wrong but in word), D at position 4.

Then feedback will tell us about E at position 1? L at position 2? D at position 4? And I at position 3 which should be ""-"" again.

But we can also learn more letters.

Since we are limited on guesses, we need informative word.

Another common word: ""WIELD"" -> W,I,E,L,D -> doesn't end with E? The fifth letter is D, not E? Not.

""FIELD"" same issue.

""BEIGE"" -> B,E,I,G,E? Positions: B1, E2, I3, G4, E5? But I at position 3? We know is not position 3? So will get ""-"" for I? And E at position 2: if not in word, or present? .

But ""BEIGE"" uses E twice? 

But consider: it tests B,G, and also position 2 E? We might get information about E elsewhere.

From first guess and second guess, we know only E at position 5 is confirmed? But there could be other E's.

But let's choose ""BEIGE"": has B,E,I,G,E. Letters: B,E,I,G. All not banned? Yes.

So guess ""BEIGE"".

Or ""DEUCE"" -> D,E,U,C,E -> C excluded? Forbidden.

""HELIX"" has X but no E at end.

I think ""ELIDE"" might be good: E,D,L are new letters? And position 4 D? and position 3 I which we know is misplaced.

ELIDE: E1,L2,I3,D4,E5.

Then, if we get feedback, E at position 1 might be x (if no duplicate E), or - or ✓. L at position 2 feedback? D at position 4? I at position 3: - (as expected because we know I is not at position 3)? E at position 5: ✓.

But we know E is already at position 5, so the only new is the first E? If it's not the same E.

Since we have limited options, I'll go with ""ELIDE"".

Or another word: ""IMPEL"" - but doesn't end with E? ""IMPEL"" is I,M,P,E,L -> ends with L? Not.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- From Guess 1 (CRATE): E is correctly placed at position 5 (✓), and C, R, A, T are not in the word.
- From Guess 2 (NOISE): E is correctly placed at position 5 (✓), I is in the word but not at position 3 (-), and N, O, S are not in the word.
- Key insights:
  - The secret word ends with E (e.g., \_\_\_\_ E).
  - I must be in the word but cannot be at position 3 (since it was misplaced there in Guess 2). Therefore, I could be at position 1, 2, or 4.
  - Excluded letters: A, C, R, T, N, O, S (must not be used).
  - Additional knowledge: Only E is confirmed in the word so far, with I as a secondary known letter that is present but misplaced.

For the new guess:
- Prioritize testing possible positions for I (1, 2, or 4) while avoiding known excluded letters.
- Include other common unused letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U) to gather more information.
- Ensure E is fixed at position 5.
- Given the constraints, a good candidate is ""WHILE"": 
  - W-H-I-L-E: Positions 1 (W), 2 (H), 3 (I), 4 (L), 5 (E).
  - Tests I at position 3 again? No—correction: in ""WHILE"", I is at position 3. However, from earlier feedback, I must not be at position 3. This guess intentionally re-tests position 3 to confirm the previous feedback (expecting ""-"" for I), while introducing new letters W, H, and L.
  - Alternatively, consider better options: Given the challenge of finding words with I at position 1, 2, or 4, and ending with E, ""QUILL"" isn't valid. After evaluating, ""ELIDE"" (E at position 1 and 5, I at position 3, L at 2, D at 4) could work but duplicates E and re-tests I at position 3. A more efficient choice is ""GUILE"":
    - G-U-I-L-E: I is still at position 3, but this introduces G, U, and L—all new letters—which gives maximum information. Since I cannot be at position 3, this guess is expected to show ""-"" for I again, but it will confirm U and G status.
  - Final choice: ""GUILE"" balances new letter coverage and positional testing for I.

<guess>GUILE</guess>",GUILE,"We have previous feedback:
- Guess 1: CRATE -> C(x), R(x), A(x), T(x), E(✓)
  - This means E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter). C, R, A, T are not in the word at all.
- Guess 2: NOISE -> N(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), E(✓)
  - N, O, S are not in the word (x). I is in the word but in the wrong position (-). E is correctly placed (✓).

Key information:
1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. Letters not in the word: C, R, A, T, N, O, S.
3. I is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in NOISE, I was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning it's present but misplaced).

From Guess 2, I is in the word but not at position 4. Since position 5 is E, I can be in positions 1,2,3.

We know the word is 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E

Letters we must avoid (since they are not in the word): A, C, R, T, N, O, S.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we know I is in the word, so we must include I in one of the first three positions.

Now, we need to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Includes I (but not at position 4, so either 1,2 or 3)
- Does not contain A, C, R, T, N, O, S
- Uses other common letters to test more letters.

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 3.

We can think of words like:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E (e.g., ""IMPEL"", but M and P are not tested yet)
- Position 2: _ I _ _ E (e.g., ""QUITE"", but Q and U are less common)
- Position 3: _ _ I _ E (e.g., ""BELLE"", but E is repeated? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible, but we haven't encountered any evidence yet.)

However, we must avoid the excluded letters.

Let's brainstorm words ending in E and including I, without A,C,R,T,N,O,S.

Some options:
- ""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E -> T is excluded (from first guess, T(x)), so not allowed. Also T is excluded.
- ""EXILE"": E,X,I,L,E -> This has E at start and end? But E is known to be at the end. Also, it uses E twice? And we don't know if E is duplicated. Also, X and L are new.
  However, ""EX"" starts with E, but we don't know if E is at start? In first guess, position 1 was C(x), but that was rejected. We don't have information about E at start.

But note: In ""EXILE"", if we put it, the first E would be in position 1. Since in previous guesses E was only correct at position 5, position 1 E might not be correct or even present? We don't know.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: EXILE: E, X, I, L, E. Letters: E, X, I, L. Note T is not present, and excluded letters are A,C,R,T,N,O,S, so E,X,I,L are all allowed? We haven't tested X or L.

But ""EXILE"" has E in first position: we don't know if E is duplicated. Also, since we got E(✓) only at position 5, if E were at position 1 also, then in Guess 1 (CRATE) we would have E at position 5 correct, but the first E if present would have shown as (-) or (x) in CRATE? Actually, CRATE had E at position 5 correct, but if there were an E at position 1, CRATE didn't have E at position 1 (it had C), so we wouldn't know.

In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky. But we know E is at position 5. If there is another E, it might be in another position. We haven't tested E in other positions yet.

But in Guess 2: NOISE had E only at position 5? Yes, and it got ✓. The other positions were N,O,I,S which are all not E. So we don't know about other E's.

To be safe, we can assume the word might have duplicate E? But let's look for words without duplicates for now.

Another idea: Since I must be in positions 1,2, or 3, and we want to test more common letters.

List of available consonants and vowels: available vowels are I (since we haven't tested others except O and A excluded, so E is the only vowel we know). Available vowels: E (known at end), I (inside), and others: U, Y? And consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

Now, we can try a word that puts I in a different position than 4 and tests common consonants.

For example, consider ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E
- Ends with E
- Has I at position 3? G-U-I-L-E: positions: 1-G, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-E.
But we know from previous feedback that I is in the word, but cannot be at position 4? In NOISE, I was at position 4? Let me check:

Word: NOISE
N-1, O-2, I-3, S-4, E-5? Wait, no: NOISE is 5 letters: position 1: N, 2: O, 3: I, 4: S, 5: E.

In the feedback for NOISE, I was position 3? But the feedback says I(-), meaning I is in the word but not in position 3? Wait, let's clarify:

The feedback for NOISE: N(x) for position1, O(x) for position2, I(-) for position3, S(x) for position4, E(✓) for position5.

So for I, it was given that it's present but not at position 3. Therefore, I must be in the word but not in position 3. Hence, I cannot be at position 3? But that contradicts because in NOISE we guessed I at position 3 and got ""-"", which means it is in the word but not that position? So I must be somewhere else, but not at position 3.

Therefore, I can be at position 1, 2, or 4? But position 4 is currently occupied by S in NOISE, but S is excluded. And position 5 is E which is fixed.

Recall the secret word: _ _ _ _ E

In NOISE, we had I at position 3. Feedback for I: ""-"" meaning I is in the word but not at position 3.

Therefore, I must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 4.

But position 4: we don't know what letter is there. And I could be at position 4? But in secret word, position 4 is the fourth letter.

So, I must be in the secret word at position 1, 2, or 4.

Also, avoid letters: A,C,R,T,N,O,S.

So, for the next guess, we can try to put I at a different position to narrow down.

Possible strategies:

1. Try I at position 1: e.g., ""IMPEL""
   - I (at start) then M,P,E,L but E is at end? ""IMPEL"" would be I,M,P,E,L -> positions: 1-I, 2-M, 3-P, 4-E, 5-L -> but we need E at position 5? No, ""IMPEL"" ends with L? Not E. So invalid.

Words ending with E and starting with I? E.g., ""IMAGE"" -> I, M, A, G, E -> but A is excluded? A is forbidden. Cannot use.

""INLET"" -> N excluded? N in first guess? N was excluded in Guess 2? N(x) in NOISE, so excluded.

""QUITE"" -> T excluded.

""ISLET"" -> S excluded? And T excluded. Not good.

Let's try I at position 2: e.g., ""QUITE"" -> Q,U,I,T,E -> T excluded? T(x) from first guess? First guess: CRATE T(x), so T is excluded. Can't use.

""DIETS"" -> D,I,E,T,S -> T and S excluded? No.

""BIKED"" -> B,I,K,E,D -> ends with D? Not E. We need word ending with E.

We need words like _ I _ _ E? But position 4 must be filled.

Examples: 
- ""TITLE"" -> T excluded? T is forbidden -> No.
- ""FILEE"" -> not a word? File? But letters: F,I,L,E,E? We don't know if duplicates allowed? And E would be at end? ""FILE"" is 4 letters? Doesn't work.

Let me think ""ALIVE"" -> A excluded? A is forbidden.

""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> ends with E? Yes. Letters: G,U,I,L,E -> I at position 3? But we are considering I at position 2? ""GUILE"": G-1, U-2, I-3, L-4, E-5 -> so I at position 3? But we know I cannot be at position 3? Because in Guess 2, I at position 3 got ""-"", meaning I cannot be at position 3. Therefore, we cannot put I at position 3 again? Or can we? We can, but we know it's wrong position? Actually, we know I is in the word but not at position 3.

But if the secret word had I at position 3, then in NOISE, it would have been ""✓""? But it was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So I cannot be at position 3.

Therefore, in GUILE, if we put I at position 3, we expect ""-"" again only if I is not at 3, which we already know? This wouldn't give new information. But maybe we can test other letters.

But better to test a position where I might be.

We need to test either position 1 or 2 or 4? Position 4 is available? In secret word, position 4 must be a letter. Since E is at 5, we can try I at position 4.

But also position 1 and 2 are possible?

So, we can try a word with I at position 4? Or at position 1? Or position 2.

Given that, let's construct a word:

Option: Put I at position 4? So word: _ _ _ I E? But then the word ends with IE? And what about position 1,2,3.

Example: ""MOVIE"" -> M,O,V,I,E -> O? O is excluded? From NOISE O(x), excluded.

""DAZIE"" word? Not common. Or ""BIZIE"" no.

Another: ""TEPID"" -> doesn't end with E.

Words ending with IE? Like ""MOVIE"" -> O excluded? ""VIE""? too short.

""PLAZE"" not word? Or ""BEZIE"" not common.

Better: use common words.

Perhaps put I at position 1: e.g., ""Icing"" but that's 5 letters? ""ICING"" not ends with E? ""ICED"" not 5 letters.

""IDELE"" not word? 

Common word: ""IMAGE"" but A excluded? Not.

Another: ""INVITE"" -> N and T excluded? N excluded.

Perhaps we should avoid position 1 if we can't find.

Maybe try position 2: _ I _ _ E

Example: ""WHITE"" -> W,H,I,T,E -> T excluded? Forbidden.

""BRIDE"" -> B,R,I,D,E -> R excluded? R from first guess R(x), excluded? Cannot.

""Guide"" G,U,I,D,E -> D? But we haven't tested D. Letters: G,U,I,D,E? And U is vowel.

""GUILE"" as before, but I at position 3? Which we know is incorrect? But maybe we can test other letters.

Given the difficulty, let's list words ending with E that contain I and exclude known banned letters, and have I at position 1,2, or 4.

Position 1: I _ _ _ E:
- ""IXNIE"" not word.
- ""IMPEE"" not word.
- Hard to find common words. I'll skip.

Position 2: _ I _ _ E:
- ""QUITE"" -> Q and U and T excluded? T excluded.
- ""PIECE"" -> P,I,E,C,E -> C excluded? E repeated? And C forbidden.
- ""SIEGE"" -> S excluded.
- ""LIEGE"" -> L,I,E,G,E -> E repeated? Ends with E. But S? no S.
  Letters: L,I,E,G,E? But L is allowed. But it has two E's? Possible.

But ""LIEGE"" (a place) has positions: L-1, I-2, E-3, G-4, E-5? Then E at position 3? And E at position 5. Since we know E at position 5 is correct, but position 3 E might be additional? But we don't know.

But if we try ""LIEGE"", we will test:
- Position 1: L? Not tested before.
- Position 2: I? If I is in the word, but at position 2? We don't know.
- Position 3: E? (but we know E is only known to be at 5, might not be elsewhere)
- Position 4: G? New.
- Position 5: E known.

However, in Guess 2 (NOISE) we tested I at position 3 and got ""-"", so if I is at position 2, then in LIEGE, we put I at position 2, which could be correct? So feedback might show I as ""✓"" if it is position 2? Or ""-"" if it is elsewhere.

But let's see the banned letters: LIEGE contains L,I,E,G,E. E is allowed? We know E at 5 is in, but we can use E elsewhere? And the letters are L,I,E,G, no banned.

So ""LIEGE"" could work? But:

It tests L and G? That's fine.

Then position 4: G? If we get feedback on G.

However, we have E at position 3: if E is not in the word elsewhere except position 5, it will get x or -? Since it is present, but position 3 might be wrong? If no duplicate, it will be ""-"" but only if E is just at position 5? But we might have duplicates.

So it may not be ideal.

Another word: ""AGILE"" -> A excluded? Not.

""UTILE"" -> U,T excluded? T is excluded? From Guess1.

""ELIDE"" -> E,L,I,D,E
- Positions: E-1, L-2, I-3, D-4, E-5

We know E is at position 5? But position 1 E is unknown. I at position 3? But we know I cannot be at position 3? So we'll get ""-"" for I since it's at 3? But we already know that.

Letters: E,L,I,D,E? Avoids banned letters? Yes.

But E at position 1: it might be in the word or not? If not, it will be x, but if it is, it might be ✓ or -.

Also, it has two E's, so if the secret word has only one E, at position 5, then position 1 E will be x.

If dual E, then it might be - or ✓.

So ""ELIDE"" might work? But let's see.

Another word: ""QUINE"" -> Q and U? And N excluded? NO, N is excluded? From Guess2: N(x) excluded? Yes.

Not good.

""DWINE"" -> D,W,I,N,E -> N excluded? Excluded.

""JUMPE"" not word? 

""CHILE"" -> C excluded? No.

""THIEF"" -> T excluded? And not ends with E.

Perhaps ""BUILD"" but not E.

I think ""GUILE"" might be good: G,U,I,L,E? With I at position 3? But we know I not at position 3? So:

Word GUILE: G1, U2, I3, L4, E5.

Since we know I is not at position 3 (from previous), then for I we expect ""-"" again if I is elsewhere? Which doesn't help? But perhaps we get new information about U, G, L.

Similarly, for E, position 5 is correct? We know that.

So it's not bad? But we might not know about I.

But we can use a word that has I at position 4? Since position 4 is a possibility.

e.g., ""BEVIE"" not word? ""MOVIE"" O excluded? ""WIVIE"" not word.

""PIXIE"" -> P,I,X,I,E? Positions: P-1, I-2, X-3, I-4, E-5? Then it has I at position 2 and 4? We can test position 4.

But it has I at position 2? And we don't forbid I at other positions.

""PIXIE"": P,I,X,I,E? That's a word? P-I-X-I-E? Yes, it refers to a pixie.

Letters: P,I,X,I,E? Two I's? We haven't tested duplicates, so it's possible, but complicated? Also, P,X are new.

And avoid banned: A,C,R,T,N,O,S are banned? P,X,I,E not banned? I and E are allowed? Yes.

So ""PIXIE"" could be an option? But it has two I's? Then feedback might be confusing? But let's see how.

But to simplify, let's pick a word with I at position 1? Must end with E? How about ""IVIES"" but ends with S? Not E. ""IVIED"" not 5 letters? Not ends with E.

""ILEUM"" but not ends with E? ""ILEUS"" ends with S? Not.

We might have to compromise on the position.

But note: position 4 for I: in secret word, position 4 could be I? Then we can test.

Consider ""VAGUE"" -> V,A,G,U,E -> A excluded? No.

""HAVOC"" not E.

I think a good word is ""QUIET"" -> Q,U,I,E,T -> T excluded? And no E at end? Not.

Wait: ""MOIRE"" -> O excluded? Excluded.

Another: ""BAIME"" not word.

Perhaps ""PULSE"" -> S? S excluded.

We have to remove S in 2nd guess.

Give up: let's use ""GUILE"" for the guess. We test G,U,L? And see the I at position 3, which should give ""-"", but we already know that? And we also have E at correct position.

Alternatively, ""ELIDE"" we thought: E at position 1? L at position 2? I at position 3 (wrong but in word), D at position 4.

Then feedback will tell us about E at position 1? L at position 2? D at position 4? And I at position 3 which should be ""-"" again.

But we can also learn more letters.

Since we are limited on guesses, we need informative word.

Another common word: ""WIELD"" -> W,I,E,L,D -> doesn't end with E? The fifth letter is D, not E? Not.

""FIELD"" same issue.

""BEIGE"" -> B,E,I,G,E? Positions: B1, E2, I3, G4, E5? But I at position 3? We know is not position 3? So will get ""-"" for I? And E at position 2: if not in word, or present? .

But ""BEIGE"" uses E twice? 

But consider: it tests B,G, and also position 2 E? We might get information about E elsewhere.

From first guess and second guess, we know only E at position 5 is confirmed? But there could be other E's.

But let's choose ""BEIGE"": has B,E,I,G,E. Letters: B,E,I,G. All not banned? Yes.

So guess ""BEIGE"".

Or ""DEUCE"" -> D,E,U,C,E -> C excluded? Forbidden.

""HELIX"" has X but no E at end.

I think ""ELIDE"" might be good: E,D,L are new letters? And position 4 D? and position 3 I which we know is misplaced.

ELIDE: E1,L2,I3,D4,E5.

Then, if we get feedback, E at position 1 might be x (if no duplicate E), or - or ✓. L at position 2 feedback? D at position 4? I at position 3: - (as expected because we know I is not at position 3)? E at position 5: ✓.

But we know E is already at position 5, so the only new is the first E? If it's not the same E.

Since we have limited options, I'll go with ""ELIDE"".

Or another word: ""IMPEL"" - but doesn't end with E? ""IMPEL"" is I,M,P,E,L -> ends with L? Not.Based on the previous feedback:
- From Guess 1 (CRATE): E is correctly placed at position 5 (✓), and C, R, A, T are not in the word.
- From Guess 2 (NOISE): E is correctly placed at position 5 (✓), I is in the word but not at position 3 (-), and N, O, S are not in the word.
- Key insights:
  - The secret word ends with E (e.g., \_\_\_\_ E).
  - I must be in the word but cannot be at position 3 (since it was misplaced there in Guess 2). Therefore, I could be at position 1, 2, or 4.
  - Excluded letters: A, C, R, T, N, O, S (must not be used).
  - Additional knowledge: Only E is confirmed in the word so far, with I as a secondary known letter that is present but misplaced.

For the new guess:
- Prioritize testing possible positions for I (1, 2, or 4) while avoiding known excluded letters.
- Include other common unused letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U) to gather more information.
- Ensure E is fixed at position 5.
- Given the constraints, a good candidate is ""WHILE"": 
  - W-H-I-L-E: Positions 1 (W), 2 (H), 3 (I), 4 (L), 5 (E).
  - Tests I at position 3 again? No—correction: in ""WHILE"", I is at position 3. However, from earlier feedback, I must not be at position 3. This guess intentionally re-tests position 3 to confirm the previous feedback (expecting ""-"" for I), while introducing new letters W, H, and L.
  - Alternatively, consider better options: Given the challenge of finding words with I at position 1, 2, or 4, and ending with E, ""QUILL"" isn't valid. After evaluating, ""ELIDE"" (E at position 1 and 5, I at position 3, L at 2, D at 4) could work but duplicates E and re-tests I at position 3. A more efficient choice is ""GUILE"":
    - G-U-I-L-E: I is still at position 3, but this introduces G, U, and L—all new letters—which gives maximum information. Since I cannot be at position 3, this guess is expected to show ""-"" for I again, but it will confirm U and G status.
  - Final choice: ""GUILE"" balances new letter coverage and positional testing for I.",Guess 3: GUILE -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(-) I(-) L(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,pique,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no information, we want a word that maximizes information gain.
 Common starting words include those with many common letters and minimal repetition.
 Let's choose a word with 5 distinct letters that include common vowels and consonants.

 Good starting words: ""CRATE"", ""ROATE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

 After considering, I'll go with ""CRATE"" as it is a popular choice and covers common letters C, R, A, T, E.

 So the first guess is ""CRATE"".

<guess>CRATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRATE"":
C -> x (not in the word)
R -> x (not in the word)
A -> x (not in the word)
T -> x (not in the word)
E -> ✓ (correct and in the correct position)

So, we know:
- E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
- None of C, R, A, T are in the word.

Since E is at position 5, the secret word ends with E.

Now, for the next guess, we should:
- Avoid using C, R, A, T again because they are not in the word.
- Include other letters to test common vowels and consonants.
- Keep E in the fifth position because we know it's correct.

Given that E is fixed at position 5, we can form a new word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, T.
- Has E at the end.

Common letters remaining: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to gain more information. We might try a word with common letters that haven't been tested yet, such as S, O, L, I, N, etc.

A good candidate might be a word that ends in E and uses common letters that are still possibilities.

Let's list some words ending with E:
- ""SLIDE"": S, L, I, D, E -> But D might not be the best because we have a vowel I and S, L.
- ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> This uses common letters.
- ""HOUSE"": H, O, U, S, E -> U is less common? But S, O, H are common.
- ""QUINE"": Q is rare? Avoid.
- ""SPINE"": S, P, I, N, E -> This also looks good.

Considering common starting words and avoiding the excluded letters (C, R, A, T), we can try:

Option 1: ""NOISE"" -> letters: N, O, I, S, E (with E at the end)
Option 2: ""SPINE"" -> S, P, I, N, E
Option 3: ""SHINE"" -> S, H, I, N, E
Option 4: ""OUNCE"" -> but OUNCE has C? Wait, we cannot use C because it was excluded. So no.

""NOISE"" seems good because it introduces N, O, I, S, and we know E is fixed.

We might also consider ""QUERY"", but Q is less common and we don't want to use rare letters.

Alternatively, ""OPINE"" (meaning to express an opinion) has O, P, I, N, E.

But let me check commonality: ""NOISE"" is a common word.

So I'll go with ""NOISE"".

Remember: We need to avoid C, R, A, T and ensure E is at the fifth position.

So our next guess: ""NOISE""

Format: <guess>NOISE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"":
- E is confirmed in the word and correctly positioned at the end (5th letter).
- C, R, A, and T are not in the secret word.

For the next guess:
- I must preserve the known ""E"" in the 5th position.
- I should avoid using C, R, A, T since they are excluded.
- I’ll prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, O, N, I) to maximize information gain.

A word fitting these criteria is **""NOISE""**:
- Ends with E (5th position).
- Uses new common letters: N, O, I, S.
- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, T).

<guess>NOISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: NOISE -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have previous feedback:
- Guess 1: CRATE -> C(x), R(x), A(x), T(x), E(✓)
  - This means E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter). C, R, A, T are not in the word at all.
- Guess 2: NOISE -> N(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), E(✓)
  - N, O, S are not in the word (x). I is in the word but in the wrong position (-). E is correctly placed (✓).

Key information:
1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. Letters not in the word: C, R, A, T, N, O, S.
3. I is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in NOISE, I was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning it's present but misplaced).

From Guess 2, I is in the word but not at position 4. Since position 5 is E, I can be in positions 1,2,3.

We know the word is 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E

Letters we must avoid (since they are not in the word): A, C, R, T, N, O, S.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we know I is in the word, so we must include I in one of the first three positions.

Now, we need to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Includes I (but not at position 4, so either 1,2 or 3)
- Does not contain A, C, R, T, N, O, S
- Uses other common letters to test more letters.

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 3.

We can think of words like:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E (e.g., ""IMPEL"", but M and P are not tested yet)
- Position 2: _ I _ _ E (e.g., ""QUITE"", but Q and U are less common)
- Position 3: _ _ I _ E (e.g., ""BELLE"", but E is repeated? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible, but we haven't encountered any evidence yet.)

However, we must avoid the excluded letters.

Let's brainstorm words ending in E and including I, without A,C,R,T,N,O,S.

Some options:
- ""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E -> T is excluded (from first guess, T(x)), so not allowed. Also T is excluded.
- ""EXILE"": E,X,I,L,E -> This has E at start and end? But E is known to be at the end. Also, it uses E twice? And we don't know if E is duplicated. Also, X and L are new.
  However, ""EX"" starts with E, but we don't know if E is at start? In first guess, position 1 was C(x), but that was rejected. We don't have information about E at start.

But note: In ""EXILE"", if we put it, the first E would be in position 1. Since in previous guesses E was only correct at position 5, position 1 E might not be correct or even present? We don't know.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: EXILE: E, X, I, L, E. Letters: E, X, I, L. Note T is not present, and excluded letters are A,C,R,T,N,O,S, so E,X,I,L are all allowed? We haven't tested X or L.

But ""EXILE"" has E in first position: we don't know if E is duplicated. Also, since we got E(✓) only at position 5, if E were at position 1 also, then in Guess 1 (CRATE) we would have E at position 5 correct, but the first E if present would have shown as (-) or (x) in CRATE? Actually, CRATE had E at position 5 correct, but if there were an E at position 1, CRATE didn't have E at position 1 (it had C), so we wouldn't know.

In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky. But we know E is at position 5. If there is another E, it might be in another position. We haven't tested E in other positions yet.

But in Guess 2: NOISE had E only at position 5? Yes, and it got ✓. The other positions were N,O,I,S which are all not E. So we don't know about other E's.

To be safe, we can assume the word might have duplicate E? But let's look for words without duplicates for now.

Another idea: Since I must be in positions 1,2, or 3, and we want to test more common letters.

List of available consonants and vowels: available vowels are I (since we haven't tested others except O and A excluded, so E is the only vowel we know). Available vowels: E (known at end), I (inside), and others: U, Y? And consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

Now, we can try a word that puts I in a different position than 4 and tests common consonants.

For example, consider ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E
- Ends with E
- Has I at position 3? G-U-I-L-E: positions: 1-G, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-E.
But we know from previous feedback that I is in the word, but cannot be at position 4? In NOISE, I was at position 4? Let me check:

Word: NOISE
N-1, O-2, I-3, S-4, E-5? Wait, no: NOISE is 5 letters: position 1: N, 2: O, 3: I, 4: S, 5: E.

In the feedback for NOISE, I was position 3? But the feedback says I(-), meaning I is in the word but not in position 3? Wait, let's clarify:

The feedback for NOISE: N(x) for position1, O(x) for position2, I(-) for position3, S(x) for position4, E(✓) for position5.

So for I, it was given that it's present but not at position 3. Therefore, I must be in the word but not in position 3. Hence, I cannot be at position 3? But that contradicts because in NOISE we guessed I at position 3 and got ""-"", which means it is in the word but not that position? So I must be somewhere else, but not at position 3.

Therefore, I can be at position 1, 2, or 4? But position 4 is currently occupied by S in NOISE, but S is excluded. And position 5 is E which is fixed.

Recall the secret word: _ _ _ _ E

In NOISE, we had I at position 3. Feedback for I: ""-"" meaning I is in the word but not at position 3.

Therefore, I must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 4.

But position 4: we don't know what letter is there. And I could be at position 4? But in secret word, position 4 is the fourth letter.

So, I must be in the secret word at position 1, 2, or 4.

Also, avoid letters: A,C,R,T,N,O,S.

So, for the next guess, we can try to put I at a different position to narrow down.

Possible strategies:

1. Try I at position 1: e.g., ""IMPEL""
   - I (at start) then M,P,E,L but E is at end? ""IMPEL"" would be I,M,P,E,L -> positions: 1-I, 2-M, 3-P, 4-E, 5-L -> but we need E at position 5? No, ""IMPEL"" ends with L? Not E. So invalid.

Words ending with E and starting with I? E.g., ""IMAGE"" -> I, M, A, G, E -> but A is excluded? A is forbidden. Cannot use.

""INLET"" -> N excluded? N in first guess? N was excluded in Guess 2? N(x) in NOISE, so excluded.

""QUITE"" -> T excluded.

""ISLET"" -> S excluded? And T excluded. Not good.

Let's try I at position 2: e.g., ""QUITE"" -> Q,U,I,T,E -> T excluded? T(x) from first guess? First guess: CRATE T(x), so T is excluded. Can't use.

""DIETS"" -> D,I,E,T,S -> T and S excluded? No.

""BIKED"" -> B,I,K,E,D -> ends with D? Not E. We need word ending with E.

We need words like _ I _ _ E? But position 4 must be filled.

Examples: 
- ""TITLE"" -> T excluded? T is forbidden -> No.
- ""FILEE"" -> not a word? File? But letters: F,I,L,E,E? We don't know if duplicates allowed? And E would be at end? ""FILE"" is 4 letters? Doesn't work.

Let me think ""ALIVE"" -> A excluded? A is forbidden.

""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> ends with E? Yes. Letters: G,U,I,L,E -> I at position 3? But we are considering I at position 2? ""GUILE"": G-1, U-2, I-3, L-4, E-5 -> so I at position 3? But we know I cannot be at position 3? Because in Guess 2, I at position 3 got ""-"", meaning I cannot be at position 3. Therefore, we cannot put I at position 3 again? Or can we? We can, but we know it's wrong position? Actually, we know I is in the word but not at position 3.

But if the secret word had I at position 3, then in NOISE, it would have been ""✓""? But it was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So I cannot be at position 3.

Therefore, in GUILE, if we put I at position 3, we expect ""-"" again only if I is not at 3, which we already know? This wouldn't give new information. But maybe we can test other letters.

But better to test a position where I might be.

We need to test either position 1 or 2 or 4? Position 4 is available? In secret word, position 4 must be a letter. Since E is at 5, we can try I at position 4.

But also position 1 and 2 are possible?

So, we can try a word with I at position 4? Or at position 1? Or position 2.

Given that, let's construct a word:

Option: Put I at position 4? So word: _ _ _ I E? But then the word ends with IE? And what about position 1,2,3.

Example: ""MOVIE"" -> M,O,V,I,E -> O? O is excluded? From NOISE O(x), excluded.

""DAZIE"" word? Not common. Or ""BIZIE"" no.

Another: ""TEPID"" -> doesn't end with E.

Words ending with IE? Like ""MOVIE"" -> O excluded? ""VIE""? too short.

""PLAZE"" not word? Or ""BEZIE"" not common.

Better: use common words.

Perhaps put I at position 1: e.g., ""Icing"" but that's 5 letters? ""ICING"" not ends with E? ""ICED"" not 5 letters.

""IDELE"" not word? 

Common word: ""IMAGE"" but A excluded? Not.

Another: ""INVITE"" -> N and T excluded? N excluded.

Perhaps we should avoid position 1 if we can't find.

Maybe try position 2: _ I _ _ E

Example: ""WHITE"" -> W,H,I,T,E -> T excluded? Forbidden.

""BRIDE"" -> B,R,I,D,E -> R excluded? R from first guess R(x), excluded? Cannot.

""Guide"" G,U,I,D,E -> D? But we haven't tested D. Letters: G,U,I,D,E? And U is vowel.

""GUILE"" as before, but I at position 3? Which we know is incorrect? But maybe we can test other letters.

Given the difficulty, let's list words ending with E that contain I and exclude known banned letters, and have I at position 1,2, or 4.

Position 1: I _ _ _ E:
- ""IXNIE"" not word.
- ""IMPEE"" not word.
- Hard to find common words. I'll skip.

Position 2: _ I _ _ E:
- ""QUITE"" -> Q and U and T excluded? T excluded.
- ""PIECE"" -> P,I,E,C,E -> C excluded? E repeated? And C forbidden.
- ""SIEGE"" -> S excluded.
- ""LIEGE"" -> L,I,E,G,E -> E repeated? Ends with E. But S? no S.
  Letters: L,I,E,G,E? But L is allowed. But it has two E's? Possible.

But ""LIEGE"" (a place) has positions: L-1, I-2, E-3, G-4, E-5? Then E at position 3? And E at position 5. Since we know E at position 5 is correct, but position 3 E might be additional? But we don't know.

But if we try ""LIEGE"", we will test:
- Position 1: L? Not tested before.
- Position 2: I? If I is in the word, but at position 2? We don't know.
- Position 3: E? (but we know E is only known to be at 5, might not be elsewhere)
- Position 4: G? New.
- Position 5: E known.

However, in Guess 2 (NOISE) we tested I at position 3 and got ""-"", so if I is at position 2, then in LIEGE, we put I at position 2, which could be correct? So feedback might show I as ""✓"" if it is position 2? Or ""-"" if it is elsewhere.

But let's see the banned letters: LIEGE contains L,I,E,G,E. E is allowed? We know E at 5 is in, but we can use E elsewhere? And the letters are L,I,E,G, no banned.

So ""LIEGE"" could work? But:

It tests L and G? That's fine.

Then position 4: G? If we get feedback on G.

However, we have E at position 3: if E is not in the word elsewhere except position 5, it will get x or -? Since it is present, but position 3 might be wrong? If no duplicate, it will be ""-"" but only if E is just at position 5? But we might have duplicates.

So it may not be ideal.

Another word: ""AGILE"" -> A excluded? Not.

""UTILE"" -> U,T excluded? T is excluded? From Guess1.

""ELIDE"" -> E,L,I,D,E
- Positions: E-1, L-2, I-3, D-4, E-5

We know E is at position 5? But position 1 E is unknown. I at position 3? But we know I cannot be at position 3? So we'll get ""-"" for I since it's at 3? But we already know that.

Letters: E,L,I,D,E? Avoids banned letters? Yes.

But E at position 1: it might be in the word or not? If not, it will be x, but if it is, it might be ✓ or -.

Also, it has two E's, so if the secret word has only one E, at position 5, then position 1 E will be x.

If dual E, then it might be - or ✓.

So ""ELIDE"" might work? But let's see.

Another word: ""QUINE"" -> Q and U? And N excluded? NO, N is excluded? From Guess2: N(x) excluded? Yes.

Not good.

""DWINE"" -> D,W,I,N,E -> N excluded? Excluded.

""JUMPE"" not word? 

""CHILE"" -> C excluded? No.

""THIEF"" -> T excluded? And not ends with E.

Perhaps ""BUILD"" but not E.

I think ""GUILE"" might be good: G,U,I,L,E? With I at position 3? But we know I not at position 3? So:

Word GUILE: G1, U2, I3, L4, E5.

Since we know I is not at position 3 (from previous), then for I we expect ""-"" again if I is elsewhere? Which doesn't help? But perhaps we get new information about U, G, L.

Similarly, for E, position 5 is correct? We know that.

So it's not bad? But we might not know about I.

But we can use a word that has I at position 4? Since position 4 is a possibility.

e.g., ""BEVIE"" not word? ""MOVIE"" O excluded? ""WIVIE"" not word.

""PIXIE"" -> P,I,X,I,E? Positions: P-1, I-2, X-3, I-4, E-5? Then it has I at position 2 and 4? We can test position 4.

But it has I at position 2? And we don't forbid I at other positions.

""PIXIE"": P,I,X,I,E? That's a word? P-I-X-I-E? Yes, it refers to a pixie.

Letters: P,I,X,I,E? Two I's? We haven't tested duplicates, so it's possible, but complicated? Also, P,X are new.

And avoid banned: A,C,R,T,N,O,S are banned? P,X,I,E not banned? I and E are allowed? Yes.

So ""PIXIE"" could be an option? But it has two I's? Then feedback might be confusing? But let's see how.

But to simplify, let's pick a word with I at position 1? Must end with E? How about ""IVIES"" but ends with S? Not E. ""IVIED"" not 5 letters? Not ends with E.

""ILEUM"" but not ends with E? ""ILEUS"" ends with S? Not.

We might have to compromise on the position.

But note: position 4 for I: in secret word, position 4 could be I? Then we can test.

Consider ""VAGUE"" -> V,A,G,U,E -> A excluded? No.

""HAVOC"" not E.

I think a good word is ""QUIET"" -> Q,U,I,E,T -> T excluded? And no E at end? Not.

Wait: ""MOIRE"" -> O excluded? Excluded.

Another: ""BAIME"" not word.

Perhaps ""PULSE"" -> S? S excluded.

We have to remove S in 2nd guess.

Give up: let's use ""GUILE"" for the guess. We test G,U,L? And see the I at position 3, which should give ""-"", but we already know that? And we also have E at correct position.

Alternatively, ""ELIDE"" we thought: E at position 1? L at position 2? I at position 3 (wrong but in word), D at position 4.

Then feedback will tell us about E at position 1? L at position 2? D at position 4? And I at position 3 which should be ""-"" again.

But we can also learn more letters.

Since we are limited on guesses, we need informative word.

Another common word: ""WIELD"" -> W,I,E,L,D -> doesn't end with E? The fifth letter is D, not E? Not.

""FIELD"" same issue.

""BEIGE"" -> B,E,I,G,E? Positions: B1, E2, I3, G4, E5? But I at position 3? We know is not position 3? So will get ""-"" for I? And E at position 2: if not in word, or present? .

But ""BEIGE"" uses E twice? 

But consider: it tests B,G, and also position 2 E? We might get information about E elsewhere.

From first guess and second guess, we know only E at position 5 is confirmed? But there could be other E's.

But let's choose ""BEIGE"": has B,E,I,G,E. Letters: B,E,I,G. All not banned? Yes.

So guess ""BEIGE"".

Or ""DEUCE"" -> D,E,U,C,E -> C excluded? Forbidden.

""HELIX"" has X but no E at end.

I think ""ELIDE"" might be good: E,D,L are new letters? And position 4 D? and position 3 I which we know is misplaced.

ELIDE: E1,L2,I3,D4,E5.

Then, if we get feedback, E at position 1 might be x (if no duplicate E), or - or ✓. L at position 2 feedback? D at position 4? I at position 3: - (as expected because we know I is not at position 3)? E at position 5: ✓.

But we know E is already at position 5, so the only new is the first E? If it's not the same E.

Since we have limited options, I'll go with ""ELIDE"".

Or another word: ""IMPEL"" - but doesn't end with E? ""IMPEL"" is I,M,P,E,L -> ends with L? Not.Based on the previous feedback:
- From Guess 1 (CRATE): E is correctly placed at position 5 (✓), and C, R, A, T are not in the word.
- From Guess 2 (NOISE): E is correctly placed at position 5 (✓), I is in the word but not at position 3 (-), and N, O, S are not in the word.
- Key insights:
  - The secret word ends with E (e.g., \_\_\_\_ E).
  - I must be in the word but cannot be at position 3 (since it was misplaced there in Guess 2). Therefore, I could be at position 1, 2, or 4.
  - Excluded letters: A, C, R, T, N, O, S (must not be used).
  - Additional knowledge: Only E is confirmed in the word so far, with I as a secondary known letter that is present but misplaced.

For the new guess:
- Prioritize testing possible positions for I (1, 2, or 4) while avoiding known excluded letters.
- Include other common unused letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U) to gather more information.
- Ensure E is fixed at position 5.
- Given the constraints, a good candidate is ""WHILE"": 
  - W-H-I-L-E: Positions 1 (W), 2 (H), 3 (I), 4 (L), 5 (E).
  - Tests I at position 3 again? No—correction: in ""WHILE"", I is at position 3. However, from earlier feedback, I must not be at position 3. This guess intentionally re-tests position 3 to confirm the previous feedback (expecting ""-"" for I), while introducing new letters W, H, and L.
  - Alternatively, consider better options: Given the challenge of finding words with I at position 1, 2, or 4, and ending with E, ""QUILL"" isn't valid. After evaluating, ""ELIDE"" (E at position 1 and 5, I at position 3, L at 2, D at 4) could work but duplicates E and re-tests I at position 3. A more efficient choice is ""GUILE"":
    - G-U-I-L-E: I is still at position 3, but this introduces G, U, and L—all new letters—which gives maximum information. Since I cannot be at position 3, this guess is expected to show ""-"" for I again, but it will confirm U and G status.
  - Final choice: ""GUILE"" balances new letter coverage and positional testing for I.

We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible, but we haven\'t encountered any evidence yet.)\n\nHowever, we must avoid the excluded letters.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm words ending in E and including I, without A,C,R,T,N,O,S.\n\nSome options:\n- ""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E -> T is excluded (from first guess, T(x)), so not allowed. Also T is excluded.\n- ""EXILE"": E,X,I,L,E -> This has E at start and end? But E is known to be at the end. Also, it uses E twice? And we don\'t know if E is duplicated. Also, X and L are new.\n  However, ""EX"" starts with E, but we don\'t know if E is at start? In first guess, position 1 was C(x), but that was rejected. We don\'t have information about E at start.\n\nBut note: In ""EXILE"", if we put it, the first E would be in position 1. Since in previous guesses E was only correct at position 5, position 1 E might not be correct or even present? We don\'t know.\n\nBut we have to avoid excluded letters: EXILE: E, X, I, L, E. Letters: E, X, I, L. Note T is not present, and excluded letters are A,C,R,T,N,O,S, so E,X,I,L are all allowed? We haven\'t tested X or L.\n\nBut ""EXILE"" has E in first position: we don\'t know if E is duplicated. Also, since we got E(✓) only at position 5, if E were at position 1 also, then in Guess 1 (CRATE) we would have E at position 5 correct, but the first E if present would have shown as (-) or (x) in CRATE? Actually, CRATE had E at position 5 correct, but if there were an E at position 1, CRATE didn\'t have E at position 1 (it had C), so we wouldn\'t know.\n\nIn Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky. But we know E is at position 5. If there is another E, it might be in another position. We haven\'t tested E in other positions yet.\n\nBut in Guess 2: NOISE had E only at position 5? Yes, and it got ✓. The other positions were N,O,I,S which are all not E. So we don\'t know about other E\'s.\n\nTo be safe, we can assume the word might have duplicate E? But let\'s look for words without duplicates for now.\n\nAnother idea: Since I must be in positions 1,2, or 3, and we want to test more common letters.\n\nList of available consonants and vowels: available vowels are I (since we haven\'t tested others except O and A excluded, so E is the only vowel we know). Available vowels: E (known at end), I (inside), and others: U, Y? And consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.\n\nNow, we can try a word that puts I in a different position than 4 and tests common consonants.\n\nFor example, consider ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E\n- Ends with E\n- Has I at position 3? G-U-I-L-E: positions: 1-G, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-E.\nBut we know from previous feedback that I is in the word, but cannot be at position 4? In NOISE, I was at position 4? Let me check:\n\nWord: NOISE\nN-1, O-2, I-3, S-4, E-5? Wait, no: NOISE is 5 letters: position 1: N, 2: O, 3: I, 4: S, 5: E.\n\nIn the feedback for NOISE, I was position 3? But the feedback says I(-), meaning I is in the word but not in position 3? Wait, let\'s clarify:\n\nThe feedback for NOISE: N(x) for position1, O(x) for position2, I(-) for position3, S(x) for position4, E(✓) for position5.\n\nSo for I, it was given that it\'s present but not at position 3. Therefore, I must be in the word but not in position 3. Hence, I cannot be at position 3? But that contradicts because in NOISE we guessed I at position 3 and got ""-"", which means it is in the word but not that position? So I must be somewhere else, but not at position 3.\n\nTherefore, I can be at position 1, 2, or 4? But position 4 is currently occupied by S in NOISE, but S is excluded. And position 5 is E which is fixed.\n\nRecall the secret word: _ _ _ _ E\n\nIn NOISE, we had I at position 3. Feedback for I: ""-"" meaning I is in the word but not at position 3.\n\nTherefore, I must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 4.\n\nBut position 4: we don\'t know what letter is there. And I could be at position 4? But in secret word, position 4 is the fourth letter.\n\nSo, I must be in the secret word at position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nAlso, avoid letters: A,C,R,T,N,O,S.\n\nSo, for the next guess, we can try to put I at a different position to narrow down.\n\nPossible strategies:\n\n1. Try I at position 1: e.g., ""IMPEL""\n   - I (at start) then M,P,E,L but E is at end? ""IMPEL"" would be I,M,P,E,L -> positions: 1-I, 2-M, 3-P, 4-E, 5-L -> but we need E at position 5? No, ""IMPEL"" ends with L? Not E. So invalid.\n\nWords ending with E and starting with I? E.g., ""IMAGE"" -> I, M, A, G, E -> but A is excluded? A is forbidden. Cannot use.\n\n""INLET"" -> N excluded? N in first guess? N was excluded in Guess 2? N(x) in NOISE, so excluded.\n\n""QUITE"" -> T excluded.\n\n""ISLET"" -> S excluded? And T excluded. Not good.\n\nLet\'s try I at position 2: e.g., ""QUITE"" -> Q,U,I,T,E -> T excluded? T(x) from first guess? First guess: CRATE T(x), so T is excluded. Can\'t use.\n\n""DIETS"" -> D,I,E,T,S -> T and S excluded? No.\n\n""BIKED"" -> B,I,K,E,D -> ends with D? Not E. We need word ending with E.\n\nWe need words like _ I _ _ E? But position 4 must be filled.\n\nExamples: \n- ""TITLE"" -> T excluded? T is forbidden -> No.\n- ""FILEE"" -> not a word? File? But letters: F,I,L,E,E? We don\'t know if duplicates allowed? And E would be at end? ""FILE"" is 4 letters? Doesn\'t work.\n\nLet me think ""ALIVE"" -> A excluded? A is forbidden.\n\n""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> ends with E? Yes. Letters: G,U,I,L,E -> I at position 3? But we are considering I at position 2? ""GUILE"": G-1, U-2, I-3, L-4, E-5 -> so I at position 3? But we know I cannot be at position 3? Because in Guess 2, I at position 3 got ""-"", meaning I cannot be at position 3. Therefore, we cannot put I at position 3 again? Or can we? We can, but we know it\'s wrong position? Actually, we know I is in the word but not at position 3.\n\nBut if the secret word had I at position 3, then in NOISE, it would have been ""✓""? But it was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So I cannot be at position 3.\n\nTherefore, in GUILE, if we put I at position 3, we expect ""-"" again only if I is not at 3, which we already know? This wouldn\'t give new information. But maybe we can test other letters.\n\nBut better to test a position where I might be.\n\nWe need to test either position 1 or 2 or 4? Position 4 is available? In secret word, position 4 must be a letter. Since E is at 5, we can try I at position 4.\n\nBut also position 1 and 2 are possible?\n\nSo, we can try a word with I at position 4? Or at position 1? Or position 2.\n\nGiven that, let\'s construct a word:\n\nOption: Put I at position 4? So word: _ _ _ I E? But then the word ends with IE? And what about position 1,2,3.\n\nExample: ""MOVIE"" -> M,O,V,I,E -> O? O is excluded? From NOISE O(x), excluded.\n\n""DAZIE"" word? Not common. Or ""BIZIE"" no.\n\nAnother: ""TEPID"" -> doesn\'t end with E.\n\nWords ending with IE? Like ""MOVIE"" -> O excluded? ""VIE""? too short.\n\n""PLAZE"" not word? Or ""BEZIE"" not common.\n\nBetter: use common words.\n\nPerhaps put I at position 1: e.g., ""Icing"" but that\'s 5 letters? ""ICING"" not ends with E? ""ICED"" not 5 letters.\n\n""IDELE"" not word? \n\nCommon word: ""IMAGE"" but A excluded? Not.\n\nAnother: ""INVITE"" -> N and T excluded? N excluded.\n\nPerhaps we should avoid position 1 if we can\'t find.\n\nMaybe try position 2: _ I _ _ E\n\nExample: ""WHITE"" -> W,H,I,T,E -> T excluded? Forbidden.\n\n""BRIDE"" -> B,R,I,D,E -> R excluded? R from first guess R(x), excluded? Cannot.\n\n""Guide"" G,U,I,D,E -> D? But we haven\'t tested D. Letters: G,U,I,D,E? And U is vowel.\n\n""GUILE"" as before, but I at position 3? Which we know is incorrect? But maybe we can test other letters.\n\nGiven the difficulty, let\'s list words ending with E that contain I and exclude known banned letters, and have I at position 1,2, or 4.\n\nPosition 1: I _ _ _ E:\n- ""IXNIE"" not word.\n- ""IMPEE"" not word.\n- Hard to find common words. I\'ll skip.\n\nPosition 2: _ I _ _ E:\n- ""QUITE"" -> Q and U and T excluded? T excluded.\n- ""PIECE"" -> P,I,E,C,E -> C excluded? E repeated? And C forbidden.\n- ""SIEGE"" -> S excluded.\n- ""LIEGE"" -> L,I,E,G,E -> E repeated? Ends with E. But S? no S.\n  Letters: L,I,E,G,E? But L is allowed. But it has two E\'s? Possible.\n\nBut ""LIEGE"" (a place) has positions: L-1, I-2, E-3, G-4, E-5? Then E at position 3? And E at position 5. Since we know E at position 5 is correct, but position 3 E might be additional? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut if we try ""LIEGE"", we will test:\n- Position 1: L? Not tested before.\n- Position 2: I? If I is in the word, but at position 2? We don\'t know.\n- Position 3: E? (but we know E is only known to be at 5, might not be elsewhere)\n- Position 4: G? New.\n- Position 5: E known.\n\nHowever, in Guess 2 (NOISE) we tested I at position 3 and got ""-"", so if I is at position 2, then in LIEGE, we put I at position 2, which could be correct? So feedback might show I as ""✓"" if it is position 2? Or ""-"" if it is elsewhere.\n\nBut let\'s see the banned letters: LIEGE contains L,I,E,G,E. E is allowed? We know E at 5 is in, but we can use E elsewhere? And the letters are L,I,E,G, no banned.\n\nSo ""LIEGE"" could work? But:\n\nIt tests L and G? That\'s fine.\n\nThen position 4: G? If we get feedback on G.\n\nHowever, we have E at position 3: if E is not in the word elsewhere except position 5, it will get x or -? Since it is present, but position 3 might be wrong? If no duplicate, it will be ""-"" but only if E is just at position 5? But we might have duplicates.\n\nSo it may not be ideal.\n\nAnother word: ""AGILE"" -> A excluded? Not.\n\n""UTILE"" -> U,T excluded? T is excluded? From Guess1.\n\n""ELIDE"" -> E,L,I,D,E\n- Positions: E-1, L-2, I-3, D-4, E-5\n\nWe know E is at position 5? But position 1 E is unknown. I at position 3? But we know I cannot be at position 3? So we\'ll get ""-"" for I since it\'s at 3? But we already know that.\n\nLetters: E,L,I,D,E? Avoids banned letters? Yes.\n\nBut E at position 1: it might be in the word or not? If not, it will be x, but if it is, it might be ✓ or -.\n\nAlso, it has two E\'s, so if the secret word has only one E, at position 5, then position 1 E will be x.\n\nIf dual E, then it might be - or ✓.\n\nSo ""ELIDE"" might work? But let\'s see.\n\nAnother word: ""QUINE"" -> Q and U? And N excluded? NO, N is excluded? From Guess2: N(x) excluded? Yes.\n\nNot good.\n\n""DWINE"" -> D,W,I,N,E -> N excluded? Excluded.\n\n""JUMPE"" not word? \n\n""CHILE"" -> C excluded? No.\n\n""THIEF"" -> T excluded? And not ends with E.\n\nPerhaps ""BUILD"" but not E.\n\nI think ""GUILE"" might be good: G,U,I,L,E? With I at position 3? But we know I not at position 3? So:\n\nWord GUILE: G1, U2, I3, L4, E5.\n\nSince we know I is not at position 3 (from previous), then for I we expect ""-"" again if I is elsewhere? Which doesn\'t help? But perhaps we get new information about U, G, L.\n\nSimilarly, for E, position 5 is correct? We know that.\n\nSo it\'s not bad? But we might not know about I.\n\nBut we can use a word that has I at position 4? Since position 4 is a possibility.\n\ne.g., ""BEVIE"" not word? ""MOVIE"" O excluded? ""WIVIE"" not word.\n\n""PIXIE"" -> P,I,X,I,E? Positions: P-1, I-2, X-3, I-4, E-5? Then it has I at position 2 and 4? We can test position 4.\n\nBut it has I at position 2? And we don\'t forbid I at other positions.\n\n""PIXIE"": P,I,X,I,E? That\'s a word? P-I-X-I-E? Yes, it refers to a pixie.\n\nLetters: P,I,X,I,E? Two I\'s? We haven\'t tested duplicates, so it\'s possible, but complicated? Also, P,X are new.\n\nAnd avoid banned: A,C,R,T,N,O,S are banned? P,X,I,E not banned? I and E are allowed? Yes.\n\nSo ""PIXIE"" could be an option? But it has two I\'s? Then feedback might be confusing? But let\'s see how.\n\nBut to simplify, let\'s pick a word with I at position 1? Must end with E? How about ""IVIES"" but ends with S? Not E. ""IVIED"" not 5 letters? Not ends with E.\n\n""ILEUM"" but not ends with E? ""ILEUS"" ends with S? Not.\n\nWe might have to compromise on the position.\n\nBut note: position 4 for I: in secret word, position 4 could be I? Then we can test.\n\nConsider ""VAGUE"" -> V,A,G,U,E -> A excluded? No.\n\n""HAVOC"" not E.\n\nI think a good word is ""QUIET"" -> Q,U,I,E,T -> T excluded? And no E at end? Not.\n\nWait: ""MOIRE"" -> O excluded? Excluded.\n\nAnother: ""BAIME"" not word.\n\nPerhaps ""PULSE"" -> S? S excluded.\n\nWe have to remove S in 2nd guess.\n\nGive up: let\'s use ""GUILE"" for the guess. We test G,U,L? And see the I at position 3, which should give ""-"", but we already know that? And we also have E at correct position.\n\nAlternatively, ""ELIDE"" we thought: E at position 1? L at position 2? I at position 3 (wrong but in word), D at position 4.\n\nThen feedback will tell us about E at position 1? L at position 2? D at position 4? And I at position 3 which should be ""-"" again.\n\nBut we can also learn more letters.\n\nSince we are limited on guesses, we need informative word.\n\nAnother common word: ""WIELD"" -> W,I,E,L,D -> doesn\'t end with E? The fifth letter is D, not E? Not.\n\n""FIELD"" same issue.\n\n""BEIGE"" -> B,E,I,G,E? Positions: B1, E2, I3, G4, E5? But I at position 3? We know is not position 3? So will get ""-"" for I? And E at position 2: if not in word, or present? .\n\nBut ""BEIGE"" uses E twice? \n\nBut consider: it tests B,G, and also position 2 E? We might get information about E elsewhere.\n\nFrom first guess and second guess, we know only E at position 5 is confirmed? But there could be other E\'s.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""BEIGE"": has B,E,I,G,E. Letters: B,E,I,G. All not banned? Yes.\n\nSo guess ""BEIGE"".\n\nOr ""DEUCE"" -> D,E,U,C,E -> C excluded? Forbidden.\n\n""HELIX"" has X but no E at end.\n\nI think ""ELIDE"" might be good: E,D,L are new letters? And position 4 D? and position 3 I which we know is misplaced.\n\nELIDE: E1,L2,I3,D4,E5.\n\nThen, if we get feedback, E at position 1 might be x (if no duplicate E), or - or ✓. L at position 2 feedback? D at position 4? I at position 3: - (as expected because we know I is not at position 3)? E at position 5: ✓.\n\nBut we know E is already at position 5, so the only new is the first E? If it\'s not the same E.\n\nSince we have limited options, I\'ll go with ""ELIDE"".\n\nOr another word: ""IMPEL"" - but doesn\'t end with E? ""IMPEL"" is I,M,P,E,L -> ends with L? Not.Based on the previous feedback:\n- From Guess 1 (CRATE): E is correctly placed at position 5 (✓), and C, R, A, T are not in the word.\n- From Guess 2 (NOISE): E is correctly placed at position 5 (✓), I is in the word but not at position 3 (-), and N, O, S are not in the word.\n- Key insights:\n  - The secret word ends with E (e.g., \\_\\_\\_\\_ E).\n  - I must be in the word but cannot be at position 3 (since it was misplaced there in Guess 2). Therefore, I could be at position 1, 2, or 4.\n  - Excluded letters: A, C, R, T, N, O, S (must not be used).\n  - Additional knowledge: Only E is confirmed in the word so far, with I as a secondary known letter that is present but misplaced.\n\nFor the new guess:\n- Prioritize testing possible positions for I (1, 2, or 4) while avoiding known excluded letters.\n- Include other common unused letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U) to gather more information.\n- Ensure E is fixed at position 5.\n- Given the constraints, a good candidate is ""WHILE"": \n  - W-H-I-L-E: Positions 1 (W), 2 (H), 3 (I), 4 (L), 5 (E).\n  - Tests I at position 3 again? No—correction: in ""WHILE"", I is at position 3. However, from earlier feedback, I must not be at position 3. This guess intentionally re-tests position 3 to confirm the previous feedback (expecting ""-"" for I), while introducing new letters W, H, and L.\n  - Alternatively, consider better options: Given the challenge of finding words with I at position 1, 2, or 4, and ending with E, ""QUILL"" isn\'t valid. After evaluating, ""ELIDE"" (E at position 1 and 5, I at position 3, L at 2, D at 4) could work but duplicates E and re-tests I at position 3. A more efficient choice is ""GUILE"":\n    - G-U-I-L-E: I is still at position 3, but this introduces G, U, and L—all new letters—which gives maximum information. Since I cannot be at position 3, this guess is expected to show ""-"" for I again, but it will confirm U and G status.\n  - Final choice: ""GUILE"" balances new letter coverage and positional testing for I.\n\n<guess>GUILE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: NOISE -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: GUILE -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(-) I(-) L(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from three guesses:
- Guess 1: CRATE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
  - E is in the word and at position 5 (last letter).
  - C, R, A, T are NOT in the word.
- Guess 2: NOISE -> N(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
  - E is confirmed at position 5.
  - I is in the word but not at position 3 (since in NOISE, I was at position 3 and got ""-"" meaning wrong position but present).
  - N, O, S are NOT in the word.
- Guess 3: GUILE -> G(x) U(-) I(-) L(x) E(✓)
  - E is confirmed at position 5.
  - U is in the word but not at position 2 (since in GUILE, U was at position 2 and got ""-"" meaning wrong position but present).
  - I is in the word but not at position 3 (as indicated by ""-""). This matches previous feedback.
  - G and L are NOT in the word.

Current knowledge:
- Secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ E
- Confirmed letters in the word: E (position 5), I (present, but not at position 3), U (present, but not at position 2).
- Letters not in the word: A, C, R, T, N, O, S, G, L.
- Previous positions tested: 
  - I: not at position 3.
  - U: not at position 2.

Since I and U are confirmed to be in the word, and E is fixed at the end, we need to determine:
- Positions for I and U: I could be at position 1, 2, or 4. U could be at position 1, 3, or 4.

But note: the secret word has three unknown positions (1,2,3) and one partially known (4? but E at 5). Actually, positions 1,2,3,4 are unknown, with constraints.

Also, we must avoid the excluded letters.

Remaining letters available (considering English alphabet minus excluded): 
Excluded: A,C,R,T,N,O,S,G,L. 
Available: B,D,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z. But also including I and U which are already present.

However, note that I and U are already confirmed as present, so we must include them in the next guess? And E at the end.

Additionally, we have two letters to place: I and U, which must be in the word at other positions.

Now, let's consider the possible positions for I and U:
- I: cannot be at position 3 (per Guess 2 and 3), so must be at 1, 2, or 4.
- U: cannot be at position 2 (per Guess 3), so must be at 1, 3, or 4.

Important: It is possible that I and U are at the same position? No, because each position has one letter. But one of them could be at a position and the other at another.

We have position 1,2,3,4 to fill with the following constraints:
- Position 4: could be I or U? But note, position 4 is the letter before E.

We need to form a word that:
- Contains E at position 5, and includes both I and U.
- Positions: 
  - Position 1: must be a letter that is not excluded, and must be in the word if we guess, but we don't know? We have to test.
  - Similarly for positions 2,3,4.

We also want to test new letters to narrow down.

We need to avoid known excluded letters: A,C,R,T,N,O,S,G,L.

Available consonants and vowels: vowels available are I,U,E (we know E is used). Consonants: B,D,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We should use common letters for better coverage.

Consider the word ""QUICK"": but C is excluded? And K is allowed? But ""QUICK"" doesn't end with E.

We need the word to end with E.

Possible words: 
- If I is at position 1: e.g., ""INDEX"" -> but N and D? N is excluded, and doesn't end with E? ""IDE"" is 3 letters? Not.
  Actually: I at 1, then positions 2,3,4 must be filled, ending with E? Like in ""IMPEL"" but not E ending? Hard to find.

Better: Consider U at position 3? And I at position 4? Or other combinations.

Examples: 
- I at position 4: _ _ _ I E? And U at position 1? Then word U _ _ I E? Or U _ _ _ E with I elsewhere.

For U _ _ I E: e.g., ""UPHIE"" not word? Or ""UTILE"" -> but T excluded? Not.

Similarly, I at position 2: _ I _ _ E? With U at position 3? Then _ I U _ E? But we need to fill position 4? _ I U * E?

Word: ""BIJU"" no? ""PIQUE""? P-I-Q-U-E? But Q is allowed? And ends with E? Yes.

""PIQUE"": 
- Positions: P1, I2, Q3, U4, E5? But U is at position 4? We are allowing that? And I at position 2? We don't know if that's valid? Because I hasn't been tested at position 2? Similarly, U has been tested only at position 2 and got ""-"", so it could be elsewhere? At position 4? Then it would be new.

Notice: In PIQUE, U at position 4? And I at position 2? Both are possible positions? Because U can be at 1, 3, or 4? Position 4 is allowed? And I can be at 1,2, or 4? Position 2 is allowed? 

Also, the word ""PIQUE"": 
- Letters: P,I,Q,U,E.
- Avoids excluded? P not excluded? New; I and U are known present; Q new; E known at 5.
- It also ends with E? Yes? ""PIQUE"" is spelled P-I-Q-U-E? Not? Actually, it is P-I-Q-U-E? For pique? But pique is typically P-I-Q-U-E? That's fine? Or sometimes but 5 letters? Yes.

So we can test PIQUE? However, note: position 3 is Q? Position 4 is U? Then E at 5? That's Q-U-E? Sounds okay.

But let me verify: 
- P at position 1: not tested? We can get feedback.
- I at position 2: if I is actually at position 2? Then we get ✓? Or if not, -? 
- Q at position 3: will give feedback? 
- U at position 4: feedback? 
- E at position 5: ✓ as always.

Additionally, Q is less common? But it's valid.

Another option: ""BIOME"" -> but O excluded? Not.

""WHILE"" -> W,H,I? But I at position 3? We know not? So not useful? Skip.

""HIJACK"" too long? Not 5 letters.

""QUITE"" -> Q,U,I,T,E? But T excluded? Forbidden.

""DUVET"": D,U,V,E,T -> T excluded? Forbidden.

Another common word: ""BUYED"" not word? ""BUILD"" not E? 

""MUFTI"" not E.

We have to work with E at the end.

Another word: ""PIECE"" -> P,I,E,E,E? No, P,I,E,C,E? But C excluded? Not.

""IMAGE"" -> A excluded.

""JEUNE"" -> J,E,U,N,E? N excluded? Not.

""MEDIC"" -> not E at end? ""MEDIC"" ends with C.

""OUNCE"" -> O excluded? And N? No.

""PIQUE"" seems acceptable? Let's check if it's valid: Pique is an English word? Yes, meaning to stimulate interest or to provoke.

So we'll use ""PIQUE"" as the next guess? But wait, position 4 is U? And we have U, which must be present, but at position 4? 

But in our feedback, U was at position 2 in GUILE? And we got ""-"", meaning U is in the word but not at position 2? So it could be elsewhere? So yes.

Similarly, I at position 2 in PIQUE? Could be correct? Or not? But we will get feedback.

We also introduce P and Q? Which are common but not very common? Still, valid.

Can we do better? ""HIVE""? 4 letters? No.

Another word: ""QUAKE"" -> Q,U,A,K,E -> A is excluded? Forbidden? No.

Not.

""UNDUE"" -> U,N,D,U,E? N excluded? And not ends? Ends with E? Positions: U1,N2,D3,U4,E5? But N excluded? Cannot.

""QUIRE"" -> Q,U,I,R,E -> R excluded? Forbidden? R is excluded from first guess? R(x) in CRATE? Yes? So not.

If not ""PIQUE"", then what about ""DEUCE""? D,E,U,C,E? C excluded? Not.

""DUXES""? D,U,X,E,S? S excluded? Not.

""JUICE""? J,U,I,C,E? C excluded? Not.

Therefore, ""PIQUE"" is acceptable? So I will use that. 

But note: ""PIQUE"" has Q? It is high-scoring but will test the letter? Okay.

Then guess: PIQUE.

However, let me think: Are there any common words matching? 

Other possibilities: ""BUILD"" no E? ""BUYER""? B,U,Y,E,R -> R excluded? Not.

""EXPEND"" too long? 

So PIQUE is a valid choice.

But we must have only the unused letters? And include I and U? Yes.

So my next guess is PIQUE.

But wait: In PIQUE, we have position: 
1: P
2: I
3: Q
4: U
5: E

We know U is in the word? But what if U is actually at position 1? Then in PIQUE? How would that work? 

If U is at position 1? Then we are putting U at position 4? Which is wrong? But U will get ""-""? Or if the secret word has U at position 1? Then our guess would have U at position 4? So we'd get ""-"" for U? Meaning U is present but not at position 4? Similarly for I? 

But overall, we will know?

If I get I at position 2? Then it might be correct? Let's see:

Alternatively, let's make a guess that also tests position 1? For U? But we are putting P at position 1? 

We don't have U in position 1? So we might miss U at position 1? But we know U has to be at 1,3, or 4? If we don't use U at 1? Then we might not detect U at 1? But if U is at position 1? Then in our guess PIQUE? There is no U at position 1? But U is at position 4? Then the feedback for U will be ""-"" and we know U is present? So we still know U is in? Then we can infer later? 

But it doesn't tell us if U is at 1 or 3? Because we haven't tested? So we do not gain direct information? But we test P and Q? 

Actually, there are multiple positions? We need more feedback.

Since we have 6 tries? We can go step by step? So PIQUE is fine? Let's proceed.

I think ""PIQUE"" is a valid guess? We'll get feedback on P, I at 2, Q, U at 4? And E.

But we can also consider ""GUISE"" -> but G excluded? Not.

""WHISK"" -> not E? 

So I'll go with PIQUE. 

But in the feedback, for GUILE? U was at position 2? It was ""-"", so U must be at 1, 3, or 4? If we then put U at position 4? And I at position 2? We are testing.

Alternatively, to cover more possibilities? We might try a word that has U at position 1? For example, ""USINE"" not word? Or ""URINE"" -> R excluded? Forbidden? R is excluded? Cannot.

""ULCER"" -> L and R excluded? Not.

So PIQUE seems reasonable.

Therefore, next guess: PIQUE.
</think>
Based on previous feedback:

- E is confirmed at position 5 (✓ in all guesses).
- I is in the word but not at position 3 (shown as ""-"" in Guess 2 and 3).
- U is in the word but not at position 2 (shown as ""-"" in Guess 3).
- Excluded letters (appearing with ""x""): A, C, R, T, N, O, S, G, L.

The secret word ends with E and contains both I and U. Possible positions:
- I could be at position 1, 2, or 4 (cannot be 3 based on feedback).
- U could be at position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 based on feedback).

To narrow down positions for I and U and test new letters, select a word that:
- Has ""E"" at position 5.
- Places I and U in untested positions (e.g., I at position 2 and U at position 4).
- Uses new common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., P and Q).
- Avoids all excluded letters.

""PIQUE"" fits these criteria:
- P (new letter) at position 1.
- I at position 2 (previously untested position for I).
- Q (new letter) at position 3.
- U at position 4 (previously untested position for U).
- E at position 5 (confirmed).

This guess efficiently tests potential positions for I and U while introducing two new letters (P and Q).

<guess>PIQUE</guess>",PIQUE,"We are given feedback from three guesses:
- Guess 1: CRATE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
  - E is in the word and at position 5 (last letter).
  - C, R, A, T are NOT in the word.
- Guess 2: NOISE -> N(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
  - E is confirmed at position 5.
  - I is in the word but not at position 3 (since in NOISE, I was at position 3 and got ""-"" meaning wrong position but present).
  - N, O, S are NOT in the word.
- Guess 3: GUILE -> G(x) U(-) I(-) L(x) E(✓)
  - E is confirmed at position 5.
  - U is in the word but not at position 2 (since in GUILE, U was at position 2 and got ""-"" meaning wrong position but present).
  - I is in the word but not at position 3 (as indicated by ""-""). This matches previous feedback.
  - G and L are NOT in the word.

Current knowledge:
- Secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ E
- Confirmed letters in the word: E (position 5), I (present, but not at position 3), U (present, but not at position 2).
- Letters not in the word: A, C, R, T, N, O, S, G, L.
- Previous positions tested: 
  - I: not at position 3.
  - U: not at position 2.

Since I and U are confirmed to be in the word, and E is fixed at the end, we need to determine:
- Positions for I and U: I could be at position 1, 2, or 4. U could be at position 1, 3, or 4.

But note: the secret word has three unknown positions (1,2,3) and one partially known (4? but E at 5). Actually, positions 1,2,3,4 are unknown, with constraints.

Also, we must avoid the excluded letters.

Remaining letters available (considering English alphabet minus excluded): 
Excluded: A,C,R,T,N,O,S,G,L. 
Available: B,D,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z. But also including I and U which are already present.

However, note that I and U are already confirmed as present, so we must include them in the next guess? And E at the end.

Additionally, we have two letters to place: I and U, which must be in the word at other positions.

Now, let's consider the possible positions for I and U:
- I: cannot be at position 3 (per Guess 2 and 3), so must be at 1, 2, or 4.
- U: cannot be at position 2 (per Guess 3), so must be at 1, 3, or 4.

Important: It is possible that I and U are at the same position? No, because each position has one letter. But one of them could be at a position and the other at another.

We have position 1,2,3,4 to fill with the following constraints:
- Position 4: could be I or U? But note, position 4 is the letter before E.

We need to form a word that:
- Contains E at position 5, and includes both I and U.
- Positions: 
  - Position 1: must be a letter that is not excluded, and must be in the word if we guess, but we don't know? We have to test.
  - Similarly for positions 2,3,4.

We also want to test new letters to narrow down.

We need to avoid known excluded letters: A,C,R,T,N,O,S,G,L.

Available consonants and vowels: vowels available are I,U,E (we know E is used). Consonants: B,D,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We should use common letters for better coverage.

Consider the word ""QUICK"": but C is excluded? And K is allowed? But ""QUICK"" doesn't end with E.

We need the word to end with E.

Possible words: 
- If I is at position 1: e.g., ""INDEX"" -> but N and D? N is excluded, and doesn't end with E? ""IDE"" is 3 letters? Not.
  Actually: I at 1, then positions 2,3,4 must be filled, ending with E? Like in ""IMPEL"" but not E ending? Hard to find.

Better: Consider U at position 3? And I at position 4? Or other combinations.

Examples: 
- I at position 4: _ _ _ I E? And U at position 1? Then word U _ _ I E? Or U _ _ _ E with I elsewhere.

For U _ _ I E: e.g., ""UPHIE"" not word? Or ""UTILE"" -> but T excluded? Not.

Similarly, I at position 2: _ I _ _ E? With U at position 3? Then _ I U _ E? But we need to fill position 4? _ I U * E?

Word: ""BIJU"" no? ""PIQUE""? P-I-Q-U-E? But Q is allowed? And ends with E? Yes.

""PIQUE"": 
- Positions: P1, I2, Q3, U4, E5? But U is at position 4? We are allowing that? And I at position 2? We don't know if that's valid? Because I hasn't been tested at position 2? Similarly, U has been tested only at position 2 and got ""-"", so it could be elsewhere? At position 4? Then it would be new.

Notice: In PIQUE, U at position 4? And I at position 2? Both are possible positions? Because U can be at 1, 3, or 4? Position 4 is allowed? And I can be at 1,2, or 4? Position 2 is allowed? 

Also, the word ""PIQUE"": 
- Letters: P,I,Q,U,E.
- Avoids excluded? P not excluded? New; I and U are known present; Q new; E known at 5.
- It also ends with E? Yes? ""PIQUE"" is spelled P-I-Q-U-E? Not? Actually, it is P-I-Q-U-E? For pique? But pique is typically P-I-Q-U-E? That's fine? Or sometimes but 5 letters? Yes.

So we can test PIQUE? However, note: position 3 is Q? Position 4 is U? Then E at 5? That's Q-U-E? Sounds okay.

But let me verify: 
- P at position 1: not tested? We can get feedback.
- I at position 2: if I is actually at position 2? Then we get ✓? Or if not, -? 
- Q at position 3: will give feedback? 
- U at position 4: feedback? 
- E at position 5: ✓ as always.

Additionally, Q is less common? But it's valid.

Another option: ""BIOME"" -> but O excluded? Not.

""WHILE"" -> W,H,I? But I at position 3? We know not? So not useful? Skip.

""HIJACK"" too long? Not 5 letters.

""QUITE"" -> Q,U,I,T,E? But T excluded? Forbidden.

""DUVET"": D,U,V,E,T -> T excluded? Forbidden.

Another common word: ""BUYED"" not word? ""BUILD"" not E? 

""MUFTI"" not E.

We have to work with E at the end.

Another word: ""PIECE"" -> P,I,E,E,E? No, P,I,E,C,E? But C excluded? Not.

""IMAGE"" -> A excluded.

""JEUNE"" -> J,E,U,N,E? N excluded? Not.

""MEDIC"" -> not E at end? ""MEDIC"" ends with C.

""OUNCE"" -> O excluded? And N? No.

""PIQUE"" seems acceptable? Let's check if it's valid: Pique is an English word? Yes, meaning to stimulate interest or to provoke.

So we'll use ""PIQUE"" as the next guess? But wait, position 4 is U? And we have U, which must be present, but at position 4? 

But in our feedback, U was at position 2 in GUILE? And we got ""-"", meaning U is in the word but not at position 2? So it could be elsewhere? So yes.

Similarly, I at position 2 in PIQUE? Could be correct? Or not? But we will get feedback.

We also introduce P and Q? Which are common but not very common? Still, valid.

Can we do better? ""HIVE""? 4 letters? No.

Another word: ""QUAKE"" -> Q,U,A,K,E -> A is excluded? Forbidden? No.

Not.

""UNDUE"" -> U,N,D,U,E? N excluded? And not ends? Ends with E? Positions: U1,N2,D3,U4,E5? But N excluded? Cannot.

""QUIRE"" -> Q,U,I,R,E -> R excluded? Forbidden? R is excluded from first guess? R(x) in CRATE? Yes? So not.

If not ""PIQUE"", then what about ""DEUCE""? D,E,U,C,E? C excluded? Not.

""DUXES""? D,U,X,E,S? S excluded? Not.

""JUICE""? J,U,I,C,E? C excluded? Not.

Therefore, ""PIQUE"" is acceptable? So I will use that. 

But note: ""PIQUE"" has Q? It is high-scoring but will test the letter? Okay.

Then guess: PIQUE.

However, let me think: Are there any common words matching? 

Other possibilities: ""BUILD"" no E? ""BUYER""? B,U,Y,E,R -> R excluded? Not.

""EXPEND"" too long? 

So PIQUE is a valid choice.

But we must have only the unused letters? And include I and U? Yes.

So my next guess is PIQUE.

But wait: In PIQUE, we have position: 
1: P
2: I
3: Q
4: U
5: E

We know U is in the word? But what if U is actually at position 1? Then in PIQUE? How would that work? 

If U is at position 1? Then we are putting U at position 4? Which is wrong? But U will get ""-""? Or if the secret word has U at position 1? Then our guess would have U at position 4? So we'd get ""-"" for U? Meaning U is present but not at position 4? Similarly for I? 

But overall, we will know?

If I get I at position 2? Then it might be correct? Let's see:

Alternatively, let's make a guess that also tests position 1? For U? But we are putting P at position 1? 

We don't have U in position 1? So we might miss U at position 1? But we know U has to be at 1,3, or 4? If we don't use U at 1? Then we might not detect U at 1? But if U is at position 1? Then in our guess PIQUE? There is no U at position 1? But U is at position 4? Then the feedback for U will be ""-"" and we know U is present? So we still know U is in? Then we can infer later? 

But it doesn't tell us if U is at 1 or 3? Because we haven't tested? So we do not gain direct information? But we test P and Q? 

Actually, there are multiple positions? We need more feedback.

Since we have 6 tries? We can go step by step? So PIQUE is fine? Let's proceed.

I think ""PIQUE"" is a valid guess? We'll get feedback on P, I at 2, Q, U at 4? And E.

But we can also consider ""GUISE"" -> but G excluded? Not.

""WHISK"" -> not E? 

So I'll go with PIQUE. 

But in the feedback, for GUILE? U was at position 2? It was ""-"", so U must be at 1, 3, or 4? If we then put U at position 4? And I at position 2? We are testing.

Alternatively, to cover more possibilities? We might try a word that has U at position 1? For example, ""USINE"" not word? Or ""URINE"" -> R excluded? Forbidden? R is excluded? Cannot.

""ULCER"" -> L and R excluded? Not.

So PIQUE seems reasonable.

Therefore, next guess: PIQUE.Based on previous feedback:

- E is confirmed at position 5 (✓ in all guesses).
- I is in the word but not at position 3 (shown as ""-"" in Guess 2 and 3).
- U is in the word but not at position 2 (shown as ""-"" in Guess 3).
- Excluded letters (appearing with ""x""): A, C, R, T, N, O, S, G, L.

The secret word ends with E and contains both I and U. Possible positions:
- I could be at position 1, 2, or 4 (cannot be 3 based on feedback).
- U could be at position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 based on feedback).

To narrow down positions for I and U and test new letters, select a word that:
- Has ""E"" at position 5.
- Places I and U in untested positions (e.g., I at position 2 and U at position 4).
- Uses new common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., P and Q).
- Avoids all excluded letters.

""PIQUE"" fits these criteria:
- P (new letter) at position 1.
- I at position 2 (previously untested position for I).
- Q (new letter) at position 3.
- U at position 4 (previously untested position for U).
- E at position 5 (confirmed).

This guess efficiently tests potential positions for I and U while introducing two new letters (P and Q).",Guess 4: PIQUE -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) I(✓) Q(✓) U(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
