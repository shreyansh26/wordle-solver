We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and maximizes information gain.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.
 A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.

 Some popular starting words are: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

First, the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" was: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). That means none of these letters—C, R, A, N, E—are in the secret word. That's valuable information because I can eliminate all these letters from consideration.

Since none of these letters are in the word, I need to choose a new word that doesn't contain C, R, A, N, or E. Also, since it's a 5-letter English word, I should pick something with other common letters.

Common English letters that aren't C, R, A, N, E: Let's think of vowels and consonants. Vowels left: I, O, U (and sometimes Y). Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z—but focusing on more common ones.

Good starting words often include S, T, L, etc., but I have to avoid the ones I know aren't in the word. Since E is out, vowels might be I or O or U. But U is less common, so I should aim for I and O.

Possible words: I could try ""SLOTH"" or ""PILOT"", but I need to avoid E, A, N, C, R. ""SLOTH"" has S, L, O, T, H—none of the eliminated letters. Similarly, ""PILOT"" has P, I, L, O, T—again, avoids C,R,A,N,E.

But ""SLOTH"" might be good because it has S, L, O, T, H, which are fairly common. ""PILOT"" is also reasonable. Another option: ""FOULS"", but that has U which might not be ideal. Or ""POINT"" but that has N, which isn't allowed since N was eliminated.

N is in ""crane"" and it was marked x, so N isn't in the word, so ""point"" has N, so I can't use that. Similarly, any word with C,R,A,N,E is invalid.

So, let me list some possible words without C,R,A,N,E:

- Using S, T, L, O, I, etc.

Common words:

- ""TIGER"" has R and E, which are out, so no.

- ""MONTH"" has N and is 5 letters? ""MONTH"" has M,O,N,T,H, but N is eliminated, so skip.

- ""LIGHT"" has L,I,G,H,T—no eliminated letters: L? L isn't eliminated, I,G,H,T all possible.

Eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E. So L, I, G, H, T are all fine.

""LIGHT"" could work, but it ends with T, which might be common.

Another word: ""SPOIL"" has S,P,O,I,L—all clear.

""GUILD"" has G,U,I,L,D—U is not eliminated, but U is less common; D is fine.

But perhaps start with something that has more vowels or common letters.

Since I need maximum information, I should choose a word with letters like S, T, L, O, I, P, M, etc., avoiding the eliminated ones.

A good second guess might be words like ""SPOIL"", ""LIGHT"", ""MOIST"", etc.

""MOIST"" has M,O,I,S,T—all letters not in the eliminated set. M,O,I,S,T: none is C,R,A,N,E. Perfect.

Similarly, ""MOULD"" has U, which might not be as good.

""POISE"" has E, which is eliminated, so no.

""POISE"" ends with E, eliminated.

""BYTES"" has E and Y, but E is out.

So, ""MOIST"" seems good: M, O, I, S, T.

Another option: ""SPILT"" similar to SPOIl but SPILT has S,P,I,L,T—all fine.

But ""MOIST"" might be better because it has O and I, both vowels potentially.

I could include U, but better to stick with more common letters.

Let's go with ""MOIST"" as my guess. It uses M, O, I, S, T, all new letters, and might give good feedback.

After this guess, I can narrow down based on hits.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback from guess 1 (""crane""), where all letters—C, R, A, N, E—were marked as ""x"", indicating none of them are in the secret word. This means the secret word contains none of these letters, so I must avoid using C, R, A, N, or E in my new guess.

For my second guess, I need to maximize information gain by using common English letters that aren't eliminated. Common letters still available include S, T, L, O, I, P, M, H, G, etc. A good choice should incorporate high-frequency consonants and vowels to test new positions.

I considered words like ""MOIST"" because it:
- Uses letters not previously tested: M, O, I, S, T
- Is a valid English word
- Has a mix of vowels (O, I) and consonants (M, S, T) to cover common positions
- Avoids eliminated letters entirely

Other options like ""SPOIL"" or ""LIGHT"" were possible, but ""MOIST"" provides a balanced letter distribution and is a common starting word in such games after eliminating some letters.

Thus, my new guess is ""MOIST"".

So L, I, G, H, T are all fine.\n\n""LIGHT"" could work, but it ends with T, which might be common.\n\nAnother word: ""SPOIL"" has S,P,O,I,L—all clear.\n\n""GUILD"" has G,U,I,L,D—U is not eliminated, but U is less common; D is fine.\n\nBut perhaps start with something that has more vowels or common letters.\n\nSince I need maximum information, I should choose a word with letters like S, T, L, O, I, P, M, etc., avoiding the eliminated ones.\n\nA good second guess might be words like ""SPOIL"", ""LIGHT"", ""MOIST"", etc.\n\n""MOIST"" has M,O,I,S,T—all letters not in the eliminated set. M,O,I,S,T: none is C,R,A,N,E. Perfect.\n\nSimilarly, ""MOULD"" has U, which might not be as good.\n\n""POISE"" has E, which is eliminated, so no.\n\n""POISE"" ends with E, eliminated.\n\n""BYTES"" has E and Y, but E is out.\n\nSo, ""MOIST"" seems good: M, O, I, S, T.\n\nAnother option: ""SPILT"" similar to SPOIl but SPILT has S,P,I,L,T—all fine.\n\nBut ""MOIST"" might be better because it has O and I, both vowels potentially.\n\nI could include U, but better to stick with more common letters.\n\nLet\'s go with ""MOIST"" as my guess. It uses M, O, I, S, T, all new letters, and might give good feedback.\n\nAfter this guess, I can narrow down based on hits.Based on the previous feedback from guess 1 (""crane""), where all letters—C, R, A, N, E—were marked as ""x"", indicating none of them are in the secret word. This means the secret word contains none of these letters, so I must avoid using C, R, A, N, or E in my new guess.\n\nFor my second guess, I need to maximize information gain by using common English letters that aren\'t eliminated. Common letters still available include S, T, L, O, I, P, M, H, G, etc. A good choice should incorporate high-frequency consonants and vowels to test new positions.\n\nI considered words like ""MOIST"" because it:\n- Uses letters not previously tested: M, O, I, S, T\n- Is a valid English word\n- Has a mix of vowels (O, I) and consonants (M, S, T) to cover common positions\n- Avoids eliminated letters entirely\n\nOther options like ""SPOIL"" or ""LIGHT"" were possible, but ""MOIST"" provides a balanced letter distribution and is a common starting word in such games after eliminating some letters.\n\nThus, my new guess is ""MOIST"".\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have two previous guesses: ""crane"" and ""moist"", both with all letters marked as not present (x).
 This means the secret word contains none of the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.
 We must avoid these letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.

 Now, the available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
 But we need to form a valid 5-letter English word.

 We must use only letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Considering common English words, possible options might include words like:
 - ""PLUMB"" (has P,L,U,M? ... M is eliminated! Wait, M was in ""moist"" and is eliminated. Let me recall the eliminated letters.)

 Eliminated letters so far: from ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E; from ""moist"": M, O, I, S, T. So combined: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.

 So we cannot use any of these.

 Let's list the available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need a 5-letter word using only these letters.

 Common letters to try: perhaps L, H, P, U, G, etc.

 Examples of words:
 - ""GULPH"" - not common, might not be valid.
 - ""PLUGH"" - not a word.

 More common words:
 - ""LUCKY"" - but L,U,C,K,Y: C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated. So no.
 - ""DUMPY"" - D,U,M,P,Y: M is eliminated? Yes, M is eliminated.

 We must avoid all eliminated letters.

 Think of words without the eliminated letters.

 Possible words:
 - ""BUGLE"" -> but E is eliminated, so no.
 - ""ABOUT"" -> A and T and O eliminated? A, O, T are eliminated? Yes, A from first guess, O and T from second.

 Let's try to think of words with the available letters.

 Words that come to mind:
 - ""PLUMB"" - but M is eliminated? Yes, M is eliminated? Wait, M is in ""moist"" and we had M(x) so M is out? Actually, ""moist"" feedback was M(x), meaning M is not in the secret word? Yes.

 How about:
 ""LUPUS"" - but S is eliminated? Yes, S is eliminated.

 We must avoid: A,C,E,I,M,N,O,R,S,T.

 Available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 Let's try to form a word: 
 Consider vowels: only U and Y (which can serve as vowels) are available. So words will likely contain U or Y.

 Examples:
 - ""HUMUS"" - has U, M? M is eliminated -> ""moist"" M(x). 
 - ""FUGLY"" - F,U,G,L,Y: but we have to check if all are available? F: available, U: available, G: available, L: available, Y: available. Yes! ""Fugly"" is an informal word meaning ugly, but it's a valid English word.

 Alternatively:
 - ""BUGGY"" - has U, G, Y; B,U,G,G,Y: G is available? Yes. But double G? Valid word? Yes, meaning having bugs or defective? But also, ""buggy"" as in a vehicle.

 However, ""BUGGY"" contains B,U,G,Y and two G's? Actually, it uses B,U,G,G,Y. G appears twice, but that's okay.

 But we must make sure we don't use any eliminated letters: no A,C,E,I,M,N,O,R,S,T, etc.

 Therefore, ""BUGGY"" is acceptable? Letters: B,U,G,G,Y. All are in the available set.

 Another option: ""BULLY"" - B,U,L,L,Y: all available letters? B: yes, U: yes, L: yes, Y: yes. ""Bully"" is a word.

 Or ""GULLY"" - G,U,L,L,Y: same as above? But G and L are different? Yes, but L repeated.

 Another: ""PUDGY"" - P,U,D,G,Y. All available? Yes.

 Now, which one to choose? Since we have no information whatsoever, we should try to cover more letters.

 But note: we have only used two guesses? And we have 6 tries? Yes. But so far, 10 letters are eliminated? We defined the eliminated set: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. So 10 letters out? How many total? So we have to work with the remaining.

 We must choose a word without knowing any present letters? So we want to test as many new letters as possible? Without repetition? So better to have distinct letters.

 Unfortunately, with the constraints, it might be hard to find words with distinct letters? Because we have limited vowels.

 For example, ""BUGGY"" has double G? So it tests B,U,G,Y? Only 4 distinct letters? ""PUDGY"" has P,U,D,G,Y? 5 distinct letters: P,U,D,G,Y? That's good!

 ""PUDGY"" meaning chubby? Yes, valid.

 Another word: ""WIMPY""? But W,I,M,P,Y: I and M are eliminated? Because I in ""moist"" was I(x)? So I is eliminated? And M also? So ""wimpy"" is invalid? Because of I and M? Yes.

 ""DUVET"" - D,U,V,E? E is eliminated? So cannot use E? D,U,V,E,T? E and T are both eliminated? T from ""moist"" is eliminated? Yes.

 So back to ""PUDGY"": seems a good candidate? Distinct letters: P,U,D,G,Y.

 Alternatively, ""BUDGY""? That's not standard? ""BUDGE"" has E? Eliminated? So ""PUDGY"" is fine.

 Another word: ""JUMBO""? J,U,M,B,O: M and O eliminated? M from ""moist"" and O from ""moist""? So no? ""M"" is gone? Yes.

 ""QUACK"": Q,U,A,C,K: A and C eliminated? Yes.

 ""QUALM"": Q,U,A,L,M: A and M eliminated? Yes.

 ""LAUGH"": L,A,U,G? A eliminated? Yes? And H? But A is out? So no.

 So, ""PUDGY"" appears solid? P,U,D,G,Y? All new.

 Also, ""FUDGY"": F,U,D,G,Y? Same? But ""fudgy"" meaning rich in fudge? Also a valid word? But F is also available.

 But both ""PUDGY"" and ""FUDGY"" are valid and use distinct letters? Actually ""FUDGY"" has F,U,D,G,Y? 5 distinct if Y is included? Yes.

 But ""PUDGY"" and ""FUDGY"" both are adjectives? Since we need a noun usually, but Wordle accepts any common word? I think so.

 However, I think ""PUDGY"" is more common? Or ""FUDGY"" might be less known. So ""PUDGY"" might be better? Probably.

 Another possibility: ""WACKY"": W,A,C,K,Y? A and C eliminated? So no.

 ""GYPPO"": G,Y,P,P,O? O is eliminated? And P repeated? Not good.

 ""GYPSY"": G,Y,P,S,Y? S eliminated? And Y repeated? So S is eliminated? From ""moist""? Yes? S was marked x in moist? Yes? So S is eliminated? Cannot use? Also ""gypsy"" has S? So no? Oh? G,Y,P,S? S is eliminated? So not.

 So, back to ""PUDGY"" or ""FUDGY"".

 ""BLUDGE"": too long? We need 5 letters? Bludge is 6? So no.

 ""VODKA"": V,O,D,K,A? O and A eliminated? So no.

 ""PLUCK"": P,L,U,C,K? C is eliminated? C from ""crane"" was eliminated? Yes? So no.

 ""DUPLE"": D,U,P,L,E? E eliminated? No.

 ""PULPY"": P,U,L,P,Y? L and Y? But double P? So distinct letters: P,U,L,Y? 4 letters? We test P,U,L,Y? But missing one?

 Wait, words ending with Y? ""LUMPY"": L,U,M,P,Y? M eliminated? ""m"" from moist? Yes? So no.

 ""GUPPY"": G,U,P,P,Y? Double P? So distinct: G,U,P,Y? Only 4 letters? Not ideal.

 So, ""PUDGY"" and ""FUDGY"" are good? Both have 5 distinct letters? P,U,D,G,Y for ""PUDGY""; F,U,D,G,Y for ""FUDGY"". However, we need to see if Y is available? Yes, Y hasn't been eliminated.

 So, let me choose ""PUDGY"" because P is common? Or ""FUDGY"" might be less frequent? But both are acceptable.

 Also, ""BUGLE"" was eliminated because E is out? But we have alternatives? Another word: ""WHELP""? W,H,E,L,P? E eliminated? So no.

 Perhaps ""DULY""? Not 5 letters? ""DUTCH""? D,U,T,C,H? T and C eliminated? T from ""moist""? Yes? T(x)? So eliminated? So no.

 So, I think ""PUDGY"" is a valid choice? Or ""BUDDY""? B,U,D,D,Y? Double D? So distinct letters B,U,D,Y? Only 4? Not as good? So avoid.

 Another: ""GLYPH""? G,L,Y,P,H? All letters: G,L,Y,P,H? All available? G,L,Y,P,H? Yes? And distinct? Yes? ""Glyph"" is a symbol? Valid English word? Yes? Perfect?

 Why didn't I think of that earlier? ""GLYPH"": G,L,Y,P,H. Five distinct letters, all available? And no duplicates? 

 Check eliminated letters: none of G,L,Y,P,H are in {C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T}. So all are available? 

 Yes? 
 G? Not eliminated? 
 L? Not? 
 Y? Not? 
 P? Not? 
 H? Not? 

 So ""GLYPH"" is valid? Yes? 

 Alternatively, could we do ""PYGMY""? P,Y,G,M,Y? But M is eliminated? And Y repeated? So M is eliminated? Cannot use M? So no? ""Moist"" had M(x)? So M is out? ""Glyph"" doesn't have M? 

 So ""GLYPH"" is a great word? It tests G,L,Y,P,H all distinct.

 This maximizes the number of new letters? 5 distinct letters.

 So I'll go with ""GLYPH""? 

 Also, ""HUMPH""? H,U,M,P? M eliminated? And H? But M is eliminated? So no? 

 Therefore, ""GLYPH"" is better than ""PUDGY"" because it covers an additional letter? H? Actually? PUDGY: P,U,D,G,Y -> U,D are missing in GLYPH? No, GLYPH: G,L,Y,P,H? So no U or D? But that's fine? At this stage, we just need to test new letters? But we have many letters? So testing as many distinct as possible is ideal? 

 Since we don't know any letters? We have eliminated 10 letters? So there are still 16 possible letters? We can test only 5? We want to know which ones are present? So distinct letters are better? 

 Yes? So ""GLYPH"" gives us feedback on G,L,Y,P,H? 

 Another possibility: ""WHYDAH""? Not 5 letters? 

 So, I think ""GLYPH"" is an excellent choice? 

 Perhaps ""LYMPH""? L,Y,M,P,H? M eliminated? No? ""Moist"" M(x)? So M is eliminated? Cannot use? So ""glyph"" is the only one? 

 Also, ""PHLOX""? P,H,L,O? O eliminated? From ""moist"" O(x)? So O is eliminated? Cannot? 

 So, ""GLYPH"" seems solid? 

 Therefore, my guess will be ""glyph"".

</think>
In the previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → eliminated C, R, A, N, E.
- ""moist"" had all letters incorrect: M(x), O(x), I(x), S(x), T(x) → eliminated M, O, I, S, T.

Combined eliminated letters: **C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T**.  
Available letters are: **B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.

The new guess must:
- Be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Avoid all eliminated letters.
- Prioritize high-frequency remaining letters and distinct letters to maximize information gain.

After eliminating the above 10 letters, options are limited. Potential words include:
- ""FUDGY"" (F, U, D, G, Y) – valid but informal.
- ""PUDGY"" (P, U, D, G, Y) – valid.
- ""GLYPH"" (G, L, Y, P, H) – valid, uses 5 distinct letters, and tests common consonants (G, L, P, H) and Y.

""GLYPH"" is chosen because:
- It uses entirely new letters: G, L, Y, P, H.
- All letters are from the available set.
- It maximizes coverage of untested consonants and Y (which can act as a vowel).
- The word is valid and reasonably common (meaning a carved symbol or character).

This guess provides the best chance to identify present letters quickly due to its distinct, high-coverage letter set.

<guess>glyph</guess>",glyph,"We have two previous guesses: ""crane"" and ""moist"", both with all letters marked as not present (x).

- ""GLYPH"" (G, L, Y, P, H) – valid, uses 5 distinct letters, and tests common consonants (G, L, P, H) and Y.

""GLYPH"" is chosen because:
- It uses entirely new letters: G, L, Y, P, H.
- All letters are from the available set.
- It maximizes coverage of untested consonants and Y (which can act as a vowel).
- The word is valid and reasonably common (meaning a carved symbol or character).

This guess provides the best chance to identify present letters quickly due to its distinct, high-coverage letter set.",Guess 3: glyph -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) L(✓) Y(✓) P(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
