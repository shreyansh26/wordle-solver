We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

Alright, the user is asking for my next guess in the word game. They provided feedback from my initial guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x). That means ""A"" is correct and in the right position—specifically, it's the third letter since ""A"" was the third letter in ""CRANE"". 

Interesting! So the secret word has ""A"" as the third letter. The letters C, R, N, and E don't appear in the word at all. That narrows down possibilities significantly. Now I need a new guess with ""A"" in the third position, avoiding the eliminated letters. 

Hmm, what words fit those constraints? Should focus on common letters not yet tested. For instance, consonants like S, T, L, P could be good choices. Also need vowels—since ""A"" is fixed, other vowels could be O, U, or possibly I, but I should prioritize common ones. 

Possible words: ""SAULT"" (if it's a word), but no—let's verify. Better to pick something like ""SPLAT"" or ""SLANT"", but ""N"" was eliminated. Wait, no—""N"" is out per feedback. ""SLANT"" would be invalid. Alternative? ""PLANT"" also has ""N"". Not good. 

Perhaps ""SALAD""? But double letters might not be ideal since feedback didn't indicate repeats. Another option: ""VALET"" or ""PALET""? But need valid words. Actually, ""ALIEN"" has ""E"", which was eliminated. Stick to unused consonants... 

Ah! ""STAND"" has ""S"", ""T"", ""A"" (third), ""N""—but ""N"" is eliminated. Scrap that. ""STAIR"" has ""R"" and ""I"", and ""R"" was marked absent. No. 

Better to try ""SHAKE""—""S"", ""H"", ""A"" (third), ""K"", ""E"". But ""E"" was eliminated. Not valid. Adjust... ""SHARD""? ""S"", ""H"", ""A"", ""R"", ""D""... but ""R"" is out. Frustrating. 

Wait—""PLATE"": ""P"", ""L"", ""A"" (third), ""T"", ""E"". But ""E"" was eliminated. ""PLATO"" isn't word. ""SLATE"" might work, but ""E"" is invalid. 

How about ""CHANT""? ""C"" is also out. Uh-oh. Maybe broaden options. Alternatively, ""BRAND"" has ""R"" and ""N""—both out. 

Perhaps I should consider: vowels left are O, U, I. Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, Z (many unused). 

Good candidate: ""CHANT"" is invalid due to ""C"". ""PARTY"": ""P"", ""A"" (third), ""R"", ""T"", ""Y"". ""R"" is out. Same issue. 

Instead: ""FAULT""? ""F"", ""A"" (third), ""U"", ""L"", ""T"". All new letters, no conflict. Is ""FAULT"" valid? Yes, 5-letter word. Seems solid—contains ""U"" and ""L"", both fresh. 

Alternatively, could try ""MAUVE"", but ""E"" is eliminated. ""VAGUE"" also has ""E"". Not feasible. ""HASTY"" has ""H"", ""A"", ""S"", ""T"", ""Y""—but ""S"" and ""T"" are okay since not tested. However, ""HASTY"" doesn't use a new vowel like ""FAULT"". 

""FAULT"" seems balanced: consonant-vowel-consonant-consonant structure (""F"" ""A"" ""U"" ""L"" ""T""), and avoids discarded letters. Also tests ""U"" as vowel and ""L""/""T"" as common consonants.

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
   - This means the third letter is A (since A is in position 3 and correct).
   - Also, C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

2. Guess 2: ""fault"" -> F(x), A(-), U(x), L(✓), T(x)
   - L is correct and in the fourth position (since L was in position 4 and marked ✓).
   - A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (we guessed position 2 for A in ""fault"", but it was marked as present but wrong position). 
   - F, U, T are not in the word.

Important deductions:
- The word has A, but not in the second position (from ""fault"").
- We know the third letter is A (from ""crane"").
- The fourth letter is L (from ""fault"").
- So the word has the form: _ _ A L _

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, F, U, T.

Also, from ""crane"", we know that A is in the third position and correct, so the A in ""fault"" (second position) is the same A? But wait, in ""fault"", A is in position 2 and marked as present but wrong position. That means the word has an A, but not in position 2. Since we already know there's an A in position 3, that A is accounted for. Therefore, the A in position 2 of ""fault"" is actually the same A? But that would mean the word has only one A? Or could it have two? The feedback doesn't specify if there are multiple, but we must consider.

However, note that in ""crane"", the A in position 3 was correct. In ""fault"", we put A in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong. This implies that the word has at least one A, and it is fixed at position 3. The A in position 2 of ""fault"" is the same A? But if the word has only one A, then the feedback for A in ""fault"" would be x because the A is already used in position 3? But wait, the feedback says A(-) meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So the word must have at least two A's? Or is the feedback system telling us that the letter is present regardless of position? Actually, in Wordle-style games, if there is one A and you use it in two positions, one of them will be marked as correct (if in the right spot) and the other as absent (if in the wrong spot) if there's only one. But here, in ""fault"", we have A in position 2 and it's marked as present but wrong. But we know from ""crane"" that position 3 is A. So if the word has only one A, then the A in position 2 of ""fault"" should be marked as absent? But it's marked as present. Therefore, the word must have at least two A's.

But wait, let me double-check the rules: the feedback is per letter. If the letter appears multiple times, then the feedback will account for each occurrence. However, if a letter is in the word only once and you use it twice, then one might be marked as present (if in the correct position) and the other as absent (if in the wrong position). But in this case, we have:

- In ""crane"": position 3 is A and correct (so the word has an A at position 3).
- In ""fault"": we put A at position 2 and it is marked as present but wrong. This means the word has an A that is not at position 3? But we already have an A at position 3. Therefore, the word must have at least two A's.

Alternatively, the feedback for ""fault"" might be indicating the same A that is at position 3? But that doesn't make sense because the A at position 3 is already accounted for in ""crane"", and in ""fault"" we are using A again. The rules say: ""The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position."" So if the word has one A and it is at position 3, then when we put A at position 2, it should be marked as absent? But here it's marked as present. This implies that the word has at least two A's.

But let's consider: the feedback for ""fault"" is independent. The system doesn't know we already know about the A at position 3. It will mark the A at position 2 as present if there is an A in the word that is not at position 2 and not already accounted for by a correct guess. However, since we haven't revealed the position 3 A in the same guess, the system will mark the A at position 2 as present because there is an A in the word (at position 3) that hasn't been matched in this guess. So it doesn't necessarily mean two A's. It just means that the word has at least one A that is not at position 2. And we know that A is at position 3, so that explains it.

Therefore, we don't need two A's. The word has one A at position 3, and when we put A at position 2 in ""fault"", it is marked as present (because there is an A in the word) but in the wrong position (because it's not at position 3). So the word has exactly one A, at position 3.

So the word is: _ _ A L _

Now, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, F, U, T.

We also have L at position 4 and A at position 3.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits: _ _ A L _

We must avoid the eliminated letters.

What letters are left? We have not used: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word with the pattern _ _ A L _

We also have the feedback from ""fault"" that the A in position 2 was marked as present but wrong, but that was because the A is at position 3. So that doesn't give new information about other positions.

But note: in ""fault"", the L was at position 4 and correct. The other letters (F, A, U, T) were either absent or present but in wrong positions. We know F, U, T are absent. A is present but in the wrong position (which we know is because it's at position 3, not 2).

So we have no additional constraints from ""fault"" beyond the L at position 4 and the absence of F, U, T.

Now, we need to choose a word that tests common letters and fits the pattern.

Possible words: 
- We can try words with S, T is eliminated so not T. T is eliminated? In ""fault"", T was at the end and marked x, so T is not in the word.

Let me list some words that fit _ _ A L _ and avoid C, R, N, E, F, U, T.

Examples:
- ""small"": S M A L L -> but has double L? The pattern is _ _ A L _, so the last letter is unknown. ""small"" has L at the end? Wait, ""small"" is S M A L L -> positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:A, 4:L, 5:L. But we don't know if double letters are allowed? The rules don't say they aren't. However, we have to check if L can be at the end? But we have L at position 4, and the fifth letter is unknown. In ""small"", the fourth letter is L and the fifth is L. That's possible. But we have to avoid eliminated letters. S and M are not eliminated. However, we have to see if it fits the feedback.

But we haven't tested S and M. Also, note that in ""small"", the fifth letter is L. But we don't know if that's allowed. Alternatively, we can try:

- ""scalp"": but C is eliminated.
- ""shalt"": but H and T? T is eliminated.
- ""shale"": but E is eliminated.
- ""shaly"": not common, but valid? Meaning of shale? But E is eliminated? Wait, ""shaly"" is an adjective from shale? But let's avoid if possible.

Better words:
- ""spall"": S P A L L -> again double L. And P is new.
- ""swell"": but E is eliminated and W is new, but the third letter is W? Not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another: ""dally"": D A L L Y -> but the pattern is _ _ A L _, so the third letter must be A. In ""dally"", the letters are: 1:D, 2:A, 3:L? No, that's not A at position 3.

We need the third letter to be A and the fourth to be L.

So: first two letters and last letter to be filled.

Possible words: 
- ""small"" (S M A L L) -> but double L. The fifth letter is L, which is the same as the fourth? That's allowed.
- ""shall"" (S H A L L) -> again double L.
- ""spall"" (S P A L L) -> double L.
- ""scald"" (S C A L D) -> but C is eliminated.
- ""scalp"" (S C A L P) -> C eliminated.
- ""balmy"" (B A L M Y) -> but the pattern: B at 1, A at 2, L at 3? But we need A at 3 and L at 4. So not.

We need the third letter to be A and the fourth to be L. So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] A L [letter5]

So the structure is: 1:?, 2:?, 3:A, 4:L, 5:?

Avoiding C, R, N, E, F, U, T.

Let me think of words:
- ""small"": S M A L L -> letter5 is L. So the word would be S M A L L. But then we have two L's? That's acceptable.
- ""shall"": S H A L L -> same.
- ""swell"": S W E L L -> but E is eliminated and the third letter is E, not A.

Another: ""dials"": D I A L S -> but that's D at 1, I at 2, A at 3, L at 4, S at 5. That fits. And no eliminated letters? D, I, S are not eliminated.

But wait, in ""dials"", the fourth letter is L, which is correct, and the third is A, correct. The other letters: D, I, S are new.

Similarly, ""vials"": V I A L S -> V is new.

But we can also consider ""bialy"" (a type of bread) but that's B I A L Y -> B at 1, I at 2, A at 3, L at 4, Y at 5. That fits.

But let's choose a common word. ""Small"" is common, but it has double L. We don't know if the word has double letters. We should test new letters.

We have 6 tries, so we can test multiple letters.

We want to maximize information. Since we know positions 3 and 4, we can focus on testing the first, second, and fifth positions.

We can choose a word that has many common letters that we haven't tested.

For example, use S, H, and then a common vowel for the fifth? But the fifth can be a consonant.

List of common consonants: S, T (but T is eliminated), L is already known, so not new. We need to test new letters.

We have not tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, V, W, Y, etc.

I think ""small"" is a good candidate because it tests S and M, and if the fifth letter is L, we'll know. But if it's not, then we get information.

Alternatively, ""shall"" tests S and H.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

We can also consider ""shalt"", but T is eliminated.

Another word: ""spall"" (S P A L L) tests S and P.

But I think ""dials"" is good because it tests D, I, and S.

Similarly, ""vials"" tests V, I, S.

But let's choose one that has distinct letters to maximize information.

In ""dials"": D, I, A, L, S -> all distinct except A and L are known. But we are testing D, I, S.

Similarly, ""bialy"" has B, I, A, L, Y -> distinct.

But ""bialy"" is less common.

Another common word: ""koala"" but that has O and A at the end? K O A L A -> but the pattern: 1:K, 2:O, 3:A, 4:L, 5:A. So it fits. And we test K, O, and A (but A is known). However, we have two A's? But we think there is only one A? Wait, in this word, there are two A's. But we don't know if the secret word has two A's. We thought only one, but it could have two.

But in our earlier reasoning, we thought one A because the feedback for ""fault"" could be explained by one A. However, it is possible that there are two A's. We don't know for sure.

But in ""koala"", the fifth letter is A. If the secret word has only one A at position 3, then the A at position 5 would be marked as absent? But we don't know.

To be safe, let's avoid assuming the number of A's.

But in our pattern, we have A at position 3 and L at position 4. The fifth letter is unknown.

We can try ""koala"", but it has O and K, and we haven't tested them. However, it has two A's, which might complicate.

I think ""small"" is a solid choice because it's common and tests S and M.

But ""small"" has two L's. The fourth letter is L and the fifth is L. So if the secret word has only one L, then the fifth L in ""small"" would be marked as absent? But we know the fourth L is correct, so the fifth L might be absent if there's no second L.

But we don't know if the word has one or two L's.

Similarly, in ""dials"", all letters are distinct.

I think ""dials"" is a good guess.

Let me check if ""dials"" is a valid word: yes, it is the plural of dial.

So I'll go with ""dials"".

We can also consider ""shale"", but E is eliminated.

Another: ""scalp"" but C is eliminated.

""papal"" has P and A, but the pattern: P A P A L -> 1:P, 2:A, 3:P, 4:A? Not matching. We need A at 3 and L at 4.

So ""papal"" is P A P A L -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:P, 4:A, 5:L -> not matching.

""label"": L A B E L -> but E is eliminated and the pattern: 1:L, 2:A, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L -> not matching because we need A at 3 and L at 4? Here A is at 2 and L at 1 and 5.

Not matching.

So ""dials"" seems good.

We can also do ""ovals"": O V A L S -> O, V, A, L, S. Fits the pattern. Tests O, V, S.

But ""dials"" tests D, I, S.

I think both are fine. I'll choose ""dials"".

So the next guess is ""dials"".

But let's confirm the pattern: 
Position 1: D
Position 2: I
Position 3: A (correct)
Position 4: L (correct)
Position 5: S

We hope to get feedback on D, I, and S.

If the word is ""small"", then we would get: D(x), I(x), A(✓), L(✓), S(?) but if the secret word is ""small"", then S is in position 1, so D and I would be absent, and S would be present but in the wrong position? Because in ""dials"", S is at position 5, but in ""small"", S is at position 1. So if the secret word is ""small"", then for ""dials"": 
- D: not in word -> x
- I: not in word -> x
- A: correct position -> ✓
- L: correct position -> ✓
- S: in the word but not at position 5 (it's at position 1) -> marked as present but wrong position (-)

But we don't know the secret word yet.

Alternatively, if the secret word is ""vital"", but T is eliminated and the pattern doesn't match because ""vital"" is V I T A L -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:T, 4:A, 5:L -> not matching because we need A at 3 and L at 4.

So ""dials"" is a safe guess.

Therefore, I'll go with ""dials"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)  
  This confirms that the third letter is **A** (position 3 is correct), and the letters C, R, N, E are **not** in the word.

- **Guess 2: fault** → Feedback: F(x) A(-) U(x) L(✓) T(x)  
  This confirms that the fourth letter is **L** (position 4 is correct). The A is in the word but **not** in position 2 (which aligns with position 3 being A). F, U, T are **not** in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A L _` (A in position 3, L in position 4).
- Eliminated letters: **C, R, N, E, F, U, T** (cannot appear anywhere).
- The A in ""fault"" (position 2) was marked as present but wrong position, but since position 3 is already confirmed as A, this suggests the word has **only one A** (no duplicates).
- Remaining letters to test: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, V, W, Y, etc.

### Strategy for this guess:
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, D, I) in positions 1, 2, and 5 to gather more information.
- Prioritize words that fit `_ _ A L _` and avoid eliminated letters.
- **""dials""** is chosen because:
  - It tests **D** (position 1), **I** (position 2), and **S** (position 5)—all new, unused letters.
  - It is a valid 5-letter word (plural of ""dial"").
  - It maximizes feedback potential: if any of D, I, or S are correct or present, it narrows down possibilities significantly.

<guess>dials</guess>",dials,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
   - This means the third letter is A (since A is in position 3 and correct).
   - Also, C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

2. Guess 2: ""fault"" -> F(x), A(-), U(x), L(✓), T(x)
   - L is correct and in the fourth position (since L was in position 4 and marked ✓).
   - A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (we guessed position 2 for A in ""fault"", but it was marked as present but wrong position). 
   - F, U, T are not in the word.

Important deductions:
- The word has A, but not in the second position (from ""fault"").
- We know the third letter is A (from ""crane"").
- The fourth letter is L (from ""fault"").
- So the word has the form: _ _ A L _

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, F, U, T.

Also, from ""crane"", we know that A is in the third position and correct, so the A in ""fault"" (second position) is the same A? But wait, in ""fault"", A is in position 2 and marked as present but wrong position. That means the word has an A, but not in position 2. Since we already know there's an A in position 3, that A is accounted for. Therefore, the A in position 2 of ""fault"" is actually the same A? But that would mean the word has only one A? Or could it have two? The feedback doesn't specify if there are multiple, but we must consider.

However, note that in ""crane"", the A in position 3 was correct. In ""fault"", we put A in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong. This implies that the word has at least one A, and it is fixed at position 3. The A in position 2 of ""fault"" is the same A? But if the word has only one A, then the feedback for A in ""fault"" would be x because the A is already used in position 3? But wait, the feedback says A(-) meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So the word must have at least two A's? Or is the feedback system telling us that the letter is present regardless of position? Actually, in Wordle-style games, if there is one A and you use it in two positions, one of them will be marked as correct (if in the right spot) and the other as absent (if in the wrong spot) if there's only one. But here, in ""fault"", we have A in position 2 and it's marked as present but wrong. But we know from ""crane"" that position 3 is A. So if the word has only one A, then the A in position 2 of ""fault"" should be marked as absent? But it's marked as present. Therefore, the word must have at least two A's.

But wait, let me double-check the rules: the feedback is per letter. If the letter appears multiple times, then the feedback will account for each occurrence. However, if a letter is in the word only once and you use it twice, then one might be marked as present (if in the correct position) and the other as absent (if in the wrong position). But in this case, we have:

- In ""crane"": position 3 is A and correct (so the word has an A at position 3).
- In ""fault"": we put A at position 2 and it is marked as present but wrong. This means the word has an A that is not at position 3? But we already have an A at position 3. Therefore, the word must have at least two A's.

Alternatively, the feedback for ""fault"" might be indicating the same A that is at position 3? But that doesn't make sense because the A at position 3 is already accounted for in ""crane"", and in ""fault"" we are using A again. The rules say: ""The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position."" So if the word has one A and it is at position 3, then when we put A at position 2, it should be marked as absent? But here it's marked as present. This implies that the word has at least two A's.

But let's consider: the feedback for ""fault"" is independent. The system doesn't know we already know about the A at position 3. It will mark the A at position 2 as present if there is an A in the word that is not at position 2 and not already accounted for by a correct guess. However, since we haven't revealed the position 3 A in the same guess, the system will mark the A at position 2 as present because there is an A in the word (at position 3) that hasn't been matched in this guess. So it doesn't necessarily mean two A's. It just means that the word has at least one A that is not at position 2. And we know that A is at position 3, so that explains it.

Therefore, we don't need two A's. The word has one A at position 3, and when we put A at position 2 in ""fault"", it is marked as present (because there is an A in the word) but in the wrong position (because it's not at position 3). So the word has exactly one A, at position 3.

So the word is: _ _ A L _

Now, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, F, U, T.

We also have L at position 4 and A at position 3.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits: _ _ A L _

We must avoid the eliminated letters.

What letters are left? We have not used: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word with the pattern _ _ A L _

We also have the feedback from ""fault"" that the A in position 2 was marked as present but wrong, but that was because the A is at position 3. So that doesn't give new information about other positions.

But note: in ""fault"", the L was at position 4 and correct. The other letters (F, A, U, T) were either absent or present but in wrong positions. We know F, U, T are absent. A is present but in the wrong position (which we know is because it's at position 3, not 2).

So we have no additional constraints from ""fault"" beyond the L at position 4 and the absence of F, U, T.

Now, we need to choose a word that tests common letters and fits the pattern.

Possible words: 
- We can try words with S, T is eliminated so not T. T is eliminated? In ""fault"", T was at the end and marked x, so T is not in the word.

Let me list some words that fit _ _ A L _ and avoid C, R, N, E, F, U, T.

Examples:
- ""small"": S M A L L -> but has double L? The pattern is _ _ A L _, so the last letter is unknown. ""small"" has L at the end? Wait, ""small"" is S M A L L -> positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:A, 4:L, 5:L. But we don't know if double letters are allowed? The rules don't say they aren't. However, we have to check if L can be at the end? But we have L at position 4, and the fifth letter is unknown. In ""small"", the fourth letter is L and the fifth is L. That's possible. But we have to avoid eliminated letters. S and M are not eliminated. However, we have to see if it fits the feedback.

But we haven't tested S and M. Also, note that in ""small"", the fifth letter is L. But we don't know if that's allowed. Alternatively, we can try:

- ""scalp"": but C is eliminated.
- ""shalt"": but H and T? T is eliminated.
- ""shale"": but E is eliminated.
- ""shaly"": not common, but valid? Meaning of shale? But E is eliminated? Wait, ""shaly"" is an adjective from shale? But let's avoid if possible.

Better words:
- ""spall"": S P A L L -> again double L. And P is new.
- ""swell"": but E is eliminated and W is new, but the third letter is W? Not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another: ""dally"": D A L L Y -> but the pattern is _ _ A L _, so the third letter must be A. In ""dally"", the letters are: 1:D, 2:A, 3:L? No, that's not A at position 3.

We need the third letter to be A and the fourth to be L.

So: first two letters and last letter to be filled.

Possible words: 
- ""small"" (S M A L L) -> but double L. The fifth letter is L, which is the same as the fourth? That's allowed.
- ""shall"" (S H A L L) -> again double L.
- ""spall"" (S P A L L) -> double L.
- ""scald"" (S C A L D) -> but C is eliminated.
- ""scalp"" (S C A L P) -> C eliminated.
- ""balmy"" (B A L M Y) -> but the pattern: B at 1, A at 2, L at 3? But we need A at 3 and L at 4. So not.

We need the third letter to be A and the fourth to be L. So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] A L [letter5]

So the structure is: 1:?, 2:?, 3:A, 4:L, 5:?

Avoiding C, R, N, E, F, U, T.

Let me think of words:
- ""small"": S M A L L -> letter5 is L. So the word would be S M A L L. But then we have two L's? That's acceptable.
- ""shall"": S H A L L -> same.
- ""swell"": S W E L L -> but E is eliminated and the third letter is E, not A.

Another: ""dials"": D I A L S -> but that's D at 1, I at 2, A at 3, L at 4, S at 5. That fits. And no eliminated letters? D, I, S are not eliminated.

But wait, in ""dials"", the fourth letter is L, which is correct, and the third is A, correct. The other letters: D, I, S are new.

Similarly, ""vials"": V I A L S -> V is new.

But we can also consider ""bialy"" (a type of bread) but that's B I A L Y -> B at 1, I at 2, A at 3, L at 4, Y at 5. That fits.

But let's choose a common word. ""Small"" is common, but it has double L. We don't know if the word has double letters. We should test new letters.

We have 6 tries, so we can test multiple letters.

We want to maximize information. Since we know positions 3 and 4, we can focus on testing the first, second, and fifth positions.

We can choose a word that has many common letters that we haven't tested.

For example, use S, H, and then a common vowel for the fifth? But the fifth can be a consonant.

List of common consonants: S, T (but T is eliminated), L is already known, so not new. We need to test new letters.

We have not tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, V, W, Y, etc.

I think ""small"" is a good candidate because it tests S and M, and if the fifth letter is L, we'll know. But if it's not, then we get information.

Alternatively, ""shall"" tests S and H.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

We can also consider ""shalt"", but T is eliminated.

Another word: ""spall"" (S P A L L) tests S and P.

But I think ""dials"" is good because it tests D, I, and S.

Similarly, ""vials"" tests V, I, S.

But let's choose one that has distinct letters to maximize information.

In ""dials"": D, I, A, L, S -> all distinct except A and L are known. But we are testing D, I, S.

Similarly, ""bialy"" has B, I, A, L, Y -> distinct.

But ""bialy"" is less common.

Another common word: ""koala"" but that has O and A at the end? K O A L A -> but the pattern: 1:K, 2:O, 3:A, 4:L, 5:A. So it fits. And we test K, O, and A (but A is known). However, we have two A's? But we think there is only one A? Wait, in this word, there are two A's. But we don't know if the secret word has two A's. We thought only one, but it could have two.

But in our earlier reasoning, we thought one A because the feedback for ""fault"" could be explained by one A. However, it is possible that there are two A's. We don't know for sure.

But in ""koala"", the fifth letter is A. If the secret word has only one A at position 3, then the A at position 5 would be marked as absent? But we don't know.

To be safe, let's avoid assuming the number of A's.

But in our pattern, we have A at position 3 and L at position 4. The fifth letter is unknown.

We can try ""koala"", but it has O and K, and we haven't tested them. However, it has two A's, which might complicate.

I think ""small"" is a solid choice because it's common and tests S and M.

But ""small"" has two L's. The fourth letter is L and the fifth is L. So if the secret word has only one L, then the fifth L in ""small"" would be marked as absent? But we know the fourth L is correct, so the fifth L might be absent if there's no second L.

But we don't know if the word has one or two L's.

Similarly, in ""dials"", all letters are distinct.

I think ""dials"" is a good guess.

Let me check if ""dials"" is a valid word: yes, it is the plural of dial.

So I'll go with ""dials"".

We can also consider ""shale"", but E is eliminated.

Another: ""scalp"" but C is eliminated.

""papal"" has P and A, but the pattern: P A P A L -> 1:P, 2:A, 3:P, 4:A? Not matching. We need A at 3 and L at 4.

So ""papal"" is P A P A L -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:P, 4:A, 5:L -> not matching.

""label"": L A B E L -> but E is eliminated and the pattern: 1:L, 2:A, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L -> not matching because we need A at 3 and L at 4? Here A is at 2 and L at 1 and 5.

Not matching.

So ""dials"" seems good.

We can also do ""ovals"": O V A L S -> O, V, A, L, S. Fits the pattern. Tests O, V, S.

But ""dials"" tests D, I, S.

I think both are fine. I'll choose ""dials"".

So the next guess is ""dials"".

But let's confirm the pattern: 
Position 1: D
Position 2: I
Position 3: A (correct)
Position 4: L (correct)
Position 5: S

We hope to get feedback on D, I, and S.

If the word is ""small"", then we would get: D(x), I(x), A(✓), L(✓), S(?) but if the secret word is ""small"", then S is in position 1, so D and I would be absent, and S would be present but in the wrong position? Because in ""dials"", S is at position 5, but in ""small"", S is at position 1. So if the secret word is ""small"", then for ""dials"": 
- D: not in word -> x
- I: not in word -> x
- A: correct position -> ✓
- L: correct position -> ✓
- S: in the word but not at position 5 (it's at position 1) -> marked as present but wrong position (-)

But we don't know the secret word yet.

Alternatively, if the secret word is ""vital"", but T is eliminated and the pattern doesn't match because ""vital"" is V I T A L -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:T, 4:A, 5:L -> not matching because we need A at 3 and L at 4.

So ""dials"" is a safe guess.

Therefore, I'll go with ""dials"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)  
  This confirms that the third letter is **A** (position 3 is correct), and the letters C, R, N, E are **not** in the word.

- **Guess 2: fault** → Feedback: F(x) A(-) U(x) L(✓) T(x)  
  This confirms that the fourth letter is **L** (position 4 is correct). The A is in the word but **not** in position 2 (which aligns with position 3 being A). F, U, T are **not** in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A L _` (A in position 3, L in position 4).
- Eliminated letters: **C, R, N, E, F, U, T** (cannot appear anywhere).
- The A in ""fault"" (position 2) was marked as present but wrong position, but since position 3 is already confirmed as A, this suggests the word has **only one A** (no duplicates).
- Remaining letters to test: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, V, W, Y, etc.

### Strategy for this guess:
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, D, I) in positions 1, 2, and 5 to gather more information.
- Prioritize words that fit `_ _ A L _` and avoid eliminated letters.
- **""dials""** is chosen because:
  - It tests **D** (position 1), **I** (position 2), and **S** (position 5)—all new, unused letters.
  - It is a valid 5-letter word (plural of ""dial"").
  - It maximizes feedback potential: if any of D, I, or S are correct or present, it narrows down possibilities significantly.",Guess 3: dials -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(x) A(✓) L(✓) S(-),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, the user is asking for my next guess in the word game. They provided feedback from my initial guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x). That means ""A"" is correct and in the right position—specifically, it's the third letter since ""A"" was the third letter in ""CRANE"". 

Interesting! So the secret word has ""A"" as the third letter. The letters C, R, N, and E don't appear in the word at all. That narrows down possibilities significantly. Now I need a new guess with ""A"" in the third position, avoiding the eliminated letters. 

Hmm, what words fit those constraints? Should focus on common letters not yet tested. For instance, consonants like S, T, L, P could be good choices. Also need vowels—since ""A"" is fixed, other vowels could be O, U, or possibly I, but I should prioritize common ones. 

Possible words: ""SAULT"" (if it's a word), but no—let's verify. Better to pick something like ""SPLAT"" or ""SLANT"", but ""N"" was eliminated. Wait, no—""N"" is out per feedback. ""SLANT"" would be invalid. Alternative? ""PLANT"" also has ""N"". Not good. 

Perhaps ""SALAD""? But double letters might not be ideal since feedback didn't indicate repeats. Another option: ""VALET"" or ""PALET""? But need valid words. Actually, ""ALIEN"" has ""E"", which was eliminated. Stick to unused consonants... 

Ah! ""STAND"" has ""S"", ""T"", ""A"" (third), ""N""—but ""N"" is eliminated. Scrap that. ""STAIR"" has ""R"" and ""I"", and ""R"" was marked absent. No. 

Better to try ""SHAKE""—""S"", ""H"", ""A"" (third), ""K"", ""E"". But ""E"" was eliminated. Not valid. Adjust... ""SHARD""? ""S"", ""H"", ""A"", ""R"", ""D""... but ""R"" is out. Frustrating. 

Wait—""PLATE"": ""P"", ""L"", ""A"" (third), ""T"", ""E"". But ""E"" was eliminated. ""PLATO"" isn't word. ""SLATE"" might work, but ""E"" is invalid. 

How about ""CHANT""? ""C"" is also out. Uh-oh. Maybe broaden options. Alternatively, ""BRAND"" has ""R"" and ""N""—both out. 

Perhaps I should consider: vowels left are O, U, I. Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, Z (many unused). 

Good candidate: ""CHANT"" is invalid due to ""C"". ""PARTY"": ""P"", ""A"" (third), ""R"", ""T"", ""Y"". ""R"" is out. Same issue. 

Instead: ""FAULT""? ""F"", ""A"" (third), ""U"", ""L"", ""T"". All new letters, no conflict. Is ""FAULT"" valid? Yes, 5-letter word. Seems solid—contains ""U"" and ""L"", both fresh. 

Alternatively, could try ""MAUVE"", but ""E"" is eliminated. ""VAGUE"" also has ""E"". Not feasible. ""HASTY"" has ""H"", ""A"", ""S"", ""T"", ""Y""—but ""S"" and ""T"" are okay since not tested. However, ""HASTY"" doesn't use a new vowel like ""FAULT"". 

""FAULT"" seems balanced: consonant-vowel-consonant-consonant structure (""F"" ""A"" ""U"" ""L"" ""T""), and avoids discarded letters. Also tests ""U"" as vowel and ""L""/""T"" as common consonants. 

So I'll go with ""FAULT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- ""A"" is correct and in the **third position** (✓).
- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" do **not** appear in the word (x).

For the next guess:
- Must place ""A"" in the **3rd position**.
- Avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"".
- Test new vowels/consonants to gather more information.

I'll choose **""FAULT""**. It:
- Places ""A"" in the 3rd position.
- Tests new letters: F, U, L, T (all unused).
- Prioritizes common consonants (L, T) and vowels (U).

<guess>fault</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: fault -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(-) U(x) L(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
   - This means the third letter is A (since A is in position 3 and correct).
   - Also, C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

2. Guess 2: ""fault"" -> F(x), A(-), U(x), L(✓), T(x)
   - L is correct and in the fourth position (since L was in position 4 and marked ✓).
   - A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (we guessed position 2 for A in ""fault"", but it was marked as present but wrong position). 
   - F, U, T are not in the word.

Important deductions:
- The word has A, but not in the second position (from ""fault"").
- We know the third letter is A (from ""crane"").
- The fourth letter is L (from ""fault"").
- So the word has the form: _ _ A L _

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, F, U, T.

Also, from ""crane"", we know that A is in the third position and correct, so the A in ""fault"" (second position) is the same A? But wait, in ""fault"", A is in position 2 and marked as present but wrong position. That means the word has an A, but not in position 2. Since we already know there's an A in position 3, that A is accounted for. Therefore, the A in position 2 of ""fault"" is actually the same A? But that would mean the word has only one A? Or could it have two? The feedback doesn't specify if there are multiple, but we must consider.

However, note that in ""crane"", the A in position 3 was correct. In ""fault"", we put A in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong. This implies that the word has at least one A, and it is fixed at position 3. The A in position 2 of ""fault"" is the same A? But if the word has only one A, then the feedback for A in ""fault"" would be x because the A is already used in position 3? But wait, the feedback says A(-) meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So the word must have at least two A's? Or is the feedback system telling us that the letter is present regardless of position? Actually, in Wordle-style games, if there is one A and you use it in two positions, one of them will be marked as correct (if in the right spot) and the other as absent (if in the wrong spot) if there's only one. But here, in ""fault"", we have A in position 2 and it's marked as present but wrong. But we know from ""crane"" that position 3 is A. So if the word has only one A, then the A in position 2 of ""fault"" should be marked as absent? But it's marked as present. Therefore, the word must have at least two A's.

But wait, let me double-check the rules: the feedback is per letter. If the letter appears multiple times, then the feedback will account for each occurrence. However, if a letter is in the word only once and you use it twice, then one might be marked as present (if in the correct position) and the other as absent (if in the wrong position). But in this case, we have:

- In ""crane"": position 3 is A and correct (so the word has an A at position 3).
- In ""fault"": we put A at position 2 and it is marked as present but wrong. This means the word has an A that is not at position 3? But we already have an A at position 3. Therefore, the word must have at least two A's.

Alternatively, the feedback for ""fault"" might be indicating the same A that is at position 3? But that doesn't make sense because the A at position 3 is already accounted for in ""crane"", and in ""fault"" we are using A again. The rules say: ""The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position."" So if the word has one A and it is at position 3, then when we put A at position 2, it should be marked as absent? But here it's marked as present. This implies that the word has at least two A's.

But let's consider: the feedback for ""fault"" is independent. The system doesn't know we already know about the A at position 3. It will mark the A at position 2 as present if there is an A in the word that is not at position 2 and not already accounted for by a correct guess. However, since we haven't revealed the position 3 A in the same guess, the system will mark the A at position 2 as present because there is an A in the word (at position 3) that hasn't been matched in this guess. So it doesn't necessarily mean two A's. It just means that the word has at least one A that is not at position 2. And we know that A is at position 3, so that explains it.

Therefore, we don't need two A's. The word has one A at position 3, and when we put A at position 2 in ""fault"", it is marked as present (because there is an A in the word) but in the wrong position (because it's not at position 3). So the word has exactly one A, at position 3.

So the word is: _ _ A L _

Now, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, F, U, T.

We also have L at position 4 and A at position 3.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits: _ _ A L _

We must avoid the eliminated letters.

What letters are left? We have not used: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word with the pattern _ _ A L _

We also have the feedback from ""fault"" that the A in position 2 was marked as present but wrong, but that was because the A is at position 3. So that doesn't give new information about other positions.

But note: in ""fault"", the L was at position 4 and correct. The other letters (F, A, U, T) were either absent or present but in wrong positions. We know F, U, T are absent. A is present but in the wrong position (which we know is because it's at position 3, not 2).

So we have no additional constraints from ""fault"" beyond the L at position 4 and the absence of F, U, T.

Now, we need to choose a word that tests common letters and fits the pattern.

Possible words: 
- We can try words with S, T is eliminated so not T. T is eliminated? In ""fault"", T was at the end and marked x, so T is not in the word.

Let me list some words that fit _ _ A L _ and avoid C, R, N, E, F, U, T.

Examples:
- ""small"": S M A L L -> but has double L? The pattern is _ _ A L _, so the last letter is unknown. ""small"" has L at the end? Wait, ""small"" is S M A L L -> positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:A, 4:L, 5:L. But we don't know if double letters are allowed? The rules don't say they aren't. However, we have to check if L can be at the end? But we have L at position 4, and the fifth letter is unknown. In ""small"", the fourth letter is L and the fifth is L. That's possible. But we have to avoid eliminated letters. S and M are not eliminated. However, we have to see if it fits the feedback.

But we haven't tested S and M. Also, note that in ""small"", the fifth letter is L. But we don't know if that's allowed. Alternatively, we can try:

- ""scalp"": but C is eliminated.
- ""shalt"": but H and T? T is eliminated.
- ""shale"": but E is eliminated.
- ""shaly"": not common, but valid? Meaning of shale? But E is eliminated? Wait, ""shaly"" is an adjective from shale? But let's avoid if possible.

Better words:
- ""spall"": S P A L L -> again double L. And P is new.
- ""swell"": but E is eliminated and W is new, but the third letter is W? Not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another: ""dally"": D A L L Y -> but the pattern is _ _ A L _, so the third letter must be A. In ""dally"", the letters are: 1:D, 2:A, 3:L? No, that's not A at position 3.

We need the third letter to be A and the fourth to be L.

So: first two letters and last letter to be filled.

Possible words: 
- ""small"" (S M A L L) -> but double L. The fifth letter is L, which is the same as the fourth? That's allowed.
- ""shall"" (S H A L L) -> again double L.
- ""spall"" (S P A L L) -> double L.
- ""scald"" (S C A L D) -> but C is eliminated.
- ""scalp"" (S C A L P) -> C eliminated.
- ""balmy"" (B A L M Y) -> but the pattern: B at 1, A at 2, L at 3? But we need A at 3 and L at 4. So not.

We need the third letter to be A and the fourth to be L. So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] A L [letter5]

So the structure is: 1:?, 2:?, 3:A, 4:L, 5:?

Avoiding C, R, N, E, F, U, T.

Let me think of words:
- ""small"": S M A L L -> letter5 is L. So the word would be S M A L L. But then we have two L's? That's acceptable.
- ""shall"": S H A L L -> same.
- ""swell"": S W E L L -> but E is eliminated and the third letter is E, not A.

Another: ""dials"": D I A L S -> but that's D at 1, I at 2, A at 3, L at 4, S at 5. That fits. And no eliminated letters? D, I, S are not eliminated.

But wait, in ""dials"", the fourth letter is L, which is correct, and the third is A, correct. The other letters: D, I, S are new.

Similarly, ""vials"": V I A L S -> V is new.

But we can also consider ""bialy"" (a type of bread) but that's B I A L Y -> B at 1, I at 2, A at 3, L at 4, Y at 5. That fits.

But let's choose a common word. ""Small"" is common, but it has double L. We don't know if the word has double letters. We should test new letters.

We have 6 tries, so we can test multiple letters.

We want to maximize information. Since we know positions 3 and 4, we can focus on testing the first, second, and fifth positions.

We can choose a word that has many common letters that we haven't tested.

For example, use S, H, and then a common vowel for the fifth? But the fifth can be a consonant.

List of common consonants: S, T (but T is eliminated), L is already known, so not new. We need to test new letters.

We have not tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, V, W, Y, etc.

I think ""small"" is a good candidate because it tests S and M, and if the fifth letter is L, we'll know. But if it's not, then we get information.

Alternatively, ""shall"" tests S and H.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

We can also consider ""shalt"", but T is eliminated.

Another word: ""spall"" (S P A L L) tests S and P.

But I think ""dials"" is good because it tests D, I, and S.

Similarly, ""vials"" tests V, I, S.

But let's choose one that has distinct letters to maximize information.

In ""dials"": D, I, A, L, S -> all distinct except A and L are known. But we are testing D, I, S.

Similarly, ""bialy"" has B, I, A, L, Y -> distinct.

But ""bialy"" is less common.

Another common word: ""koala"" but that has O and A at the end? K O A L A -> but the pattern: 1:K, 2:O, 3:A, 4:L, 5:A. So it fits. And we test K, O, and A (but A is known). However, we have two A's? But we think there is only one A? Wait, in this word, there are two A's. But we don't know if the secret word has two A's. We thought only one, but it could have two.

But in our earlier reasoning, we thought one A because the feedback for ""fault"" could be explained by one A. However, it is possible that there are two A's. We don't know for sure.

But in ""koala"", the fifth letter is A. If the secret word has only one A at position 3, then the A at position 5 would be marked as absent? But we don't know.

To be safe, let's avoid assuming the number of A's.

But in our pattern, we have A at position 3 and L at position 4. The fifth letter is unknown.

We can try ""koala"", but it has O and K, and we haven't tested them. However, it has two A's, which might complicate.

I think ""small"" is a solid choice because it's common and tests S and M.

But ""small"" has two L's. The fourth letter is L and the fifth is L. So if the secret word has only one L, then the fifth L in ""small"" would be marked as absent? But we know the fourth L is correct, so the fifth L might be absent if there's no second L.

But we don't know if the word has one or two L's.

Similarly, in ""dials"", all letters are distinct.

I think ""dials"" is a good guess.

Let me check if ""dials"" is a valid word: yes, it is the plural of dial.

So I'll go with ""dials"".

We can also consider ""shale"", but E is eliminated.

Another: ""scalp"" but C is eliminated.

""papal"" has P and A, but the pattern: P A P A L -> 1:P, 2:A, 3:P, 4:A? Not matching. We need A at 3 and L at 4.

So ""papal"" is P A P A L -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:P, 4:A, 5:L -> not matching.

""label"": L A B E L -> but E is eliminated and the pattern: 1:L, 2:A, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L -> not matching because we need A at 3 and L at 4? Here A is at 2 and L at 1 and 5.

Not matching.

So ""dials"" seems good.

We can also do ""ovals"": O V A L S -> O, V, A, L, S. Fits the pattern. Tests O, V, S.

But ""dials"" tests D, I, S.

I think both are fine. I'll choose ""dials"".

So the next guess is ""dials"".

But let's confirm the pattern: 
Position 1: D
Position 2: I
Position 3: A (correct)
Position 4: L (correct)
Position 5: S

We hope to get feedback on D, I, and S.

If the word is ""small"", then we would get: D(x), I(x), A(✓), L(✓), S(?) but if the secret word is ""small"", then S is in position 1, so D and I would be absent, and S would be present but in the wrong position? Because in ""dials"", S is at position 5, but in ""small"", S is at position 1. So if the secret word is ""small"", then for ""dials"": 
- D: not in word -> x
- I: not in word -> x
- A: correct position -> ✓
- L: correct position -> ✓
- S: in the word but not at position 5 (it's at position 1) -> marked as present but wrong position (-)

But we don't know the secret word yet.

Alternatively, if the secret word is ""vital"", but T is eliminated and the pattern doesn't match because ""vital"" is V I T A L -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:T, 4:A, 5:L -> not matching because we need A at 3 and L at 4.

So ""dials"" is a safe guess.

Therefore, I'll go with ""dials"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)  
  This confirms that the third letter is **A** (position 3 is correct), and the letters C, R, N, E are **not** in the word.

- **Guess 2: fault** → Feedback: F(x) A(-) U(x) L(✓) T(x)  
  This confirms that the fourth letter is **L** (position 4 is correct). The A is in the word but **not** in position 2 (which aligns with position 3 being A). F, U, T are **not** in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A L _` (A in position 3, L in position 4).
- Eliminated letters: **C, R, N, E, F, U, T** (cannot appear anywhere).
- The A in ""fault"" (position 2) was marked as present but wrong position, but since position 3 is already confirmed as A, this suggests the word has **only one A** (no duplicates).
- Remaining letters to test: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, V, W, Y, etc.

### Strategy for this guess:
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, D, I) in positions 1, 2, and 5 to gather more information.
- Prioritize words that fit `_ _ A L _` and avoid eliminated letters.
- **""dials""** is chosen because:
  - It tests **D** (position 1), **I** (position 2), and **S** (position 5)—all new, unused letters.
  - It is a valid 5-letter word (plural of ""dial"").
  - It maximizes feedback potential: if any of D, I, or S are correct or present, it narrows down possibilities significantly.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Alright, the user is asking for my next guess in the word game. They provided feedback from my initial guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x). That means ""A"" is correct and in the right position—specifically, it\'s the third letter since ""A"" was the third letter in ""CRANE"". \n\nInteresting! So the secret word has ""A"" as the third letter. The letters C, R, N, and E don\'t appear in the word at all. That narrows down possibilities significantly. Now I need a new guess with ""A"" in the third position, avoiding the eliminated letters. \n\nHmm, what words fit those constraints? Should focus on common letters not yet tested. For instance, consonants like S, T, L, P could be good choices. Also need vowels—since ""A"" is fixed, other vowels could be O, U, or possibly I, but I should prioritize common ones. \n\nPossible words: ""SAULT"" (if it\'s a word), but no—let\'s verify. Better to pick something like ""SPLAT"" or ""SLANT"", but ""N"" was eliminated. Wait, no—""N"" is out per feedback. ""SLANT"" would be invalid. Alternative? ""PLANT"" also has ""N"". Not good. \n\nPerhaps ""SALAD""? But double letters might not be ideal since feedback didn\'t indicate repeats. Another option: ""VALET"" or ""PALET""? But need valid words. Actually, ""ALIEN"" has ""E"", which was eliminated. Stick to unused consonants... \n\nAh! ""STAND"" has ""S"", ""T"", ""A"" (third), ""N""—but ""N"" is eliminated. Scrap that. ""STAIR"" has ""R"" and ""I"", and ""R"" was marked absent. No. \n\nBetter to try ""SHAKE""—""S"", ""H"", ""A"" (third), ""K"", ""E"". But ""E"" was eliminated. Not valid. Adjust... ""SHARD""? ""S"", ""H"", ""A"", ""R"", ""D""... but ""R"" is out. Frustrating. \n\nWait—""PLATE"": ""P"", ""L"", ""A"" (third), ""T"", ""E"". But ""E"" was eliminated. ""PLATO"" isn\'t word. ""SLATE"" might work, but ""E"" is invalid. \n\nHow about ""CHANT""? ""C"" is also out. Uh-oh. Maybe broaden options. Alternatively, ""BRAND"" has ""R"" and ""N""—both out. \n\nPerhaps I should consider: vowels left are O, U, I. Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, Z (many unused). \n\nGood candidate: ""CHANT"" is invalid due to ""C"". ""PARTY"": ""P"", ""A"" (third), ""R"", ""T"", ""Y"". ""R"" is out. Same issue. \n\nInstead: ""FAULT""? ""F"", ""A"" (third), ""U"", ""L"", ""T"". All new letters, no conflict. Is ""FAULT"" valid? Yes, 5-letter word. Seems solid—contains ""U"" and ""L"", both fresh. \n\nAlternatively, could try ""MAUVE"", but ""E"" is eliminated. ""VAGUE"" also has ""E"". Not feasible. ""HASTY"" has ""H"", ""A"", ""S"", ""T"", ""Y""—but ""S"" and ""T"" are okay since not tested. However, ""HASTY"" doesn\'t use a new vowel like ""FAULT"". \n\n""FAULT"" seems balanced: consonant-vowel-consonant-consonant structure (""F"" ""A"" ""U"" ""L"" ""T""), and avoids discarded letters. Also tests ""U"" as vowel and ""L""/""T"" as common consonants. \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""FAULT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": \n- ""A"" is correct and in the **third position** (✓).\n- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" do **not** appear in the word (x).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must place ""A"" in the **3rd position**.\n- Avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"".\n- Test new vowels/consonants to gather more information.\n\nI\'ll choose **""FAULT""**.

Guess 2: ""fault"" -> F(x), A(-), U(x), L(✓), T(x)\n   - L is correct and in the fourth position (since L was in position 4 and marked ✓).\n   - A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (we guessed position 2 for A in ""fault"", but it was marked as present but wrong position). \n   - F, U, T are not in the word.\n\nImportant deductions:\n- The word has A, but not in the second position (from ""fault"").\n- We know the third letter is A (from ""crane"").\n- The fourth letter is L (from ""fault"").\n- So the word has the form: _ _ A L _\n\nEliminated letters: C, R, N, E, F, U, T.\n\nAlso, from ""crane"", we know that A is in the third position and correct, so the A in ""fault"" (second position) is the same A? But wait, in ""fault"", A is in position 2 and marked as present but wrong position. That means the word has an A, but not in position 2. Since we already know there\'s an A in position 3, that A is accounted for. Therefore, the A in position 2 of ""fault"" is actually the same A? But that would mean the word has only one A? Or could it have two? The feedback doesn\'t specify if there are multiple, but we must consider.\n\nHowever, note that in ""crane"", the A in position 3 was correct. In ""fault"", we put A in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong. This implies that the word has at least one A, and it is fixed at position 3. The A in position 2 of ""fault"" is the same A? But if the word has only one A, then the feedback for A in ""fault"" would be x because the A is already used in position 3? But wait, the feedback says A(-) meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So the word must have at least two A\'s? Or is the feedback system telling us that the letter is present regardless of position? Actually, in Wordle-style games, if there is one A and you use it in two positions, one of them will be marked as correct (if in the right spot) and the other as absent (if in the wrong spot) if there\'s only one. But here, in ""fault"", we have A in position 2 and it\'s marked as present but wrong. But we know from ""crane"" that position 3 is A. So if the word has only one A, then the A in position 2 of ""fault"" should be marked as absent? But it\'s marked as present. Therefore, the word must have at least two A\'s.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the rules: the feedback is per letter. If the letter appears multiple times, then the feedback will account for each occurrence. However, if a letter is in the word only once and you use it twice, then one might be marked as present (if in the correct position) and the other as absent (if in the wrong position). But in this case, we have:\n\n- In ""crane"": position 3 is A and correct (so the word has an A at position 3).\n- In ""fault"": we put A at position 2 and it is marked as present but wrong. This means the word has an A that is not at position 3? But we already have an A at position 3. Therefore, the word must have at least two A\'s.\n\nAlternatively, the feedback for ""fault"" might be indicating the same A that is at position 3? But that doesn\'t make sense because the A at position 3 is already accounted for in ""crane"", and in ""fault"" we are using A again. The rules say: ""The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position."" So if the word has one A and it is at position 3, then when we put A at position 2, it should be marked as absent? But here it\'s marked as present. This implies that the word has at least two A\'s.\n\nBut let\'s consider: the feedback for ""fault"" is independent. The system doesn\'t know we already know about the A at position 3. It will mark the A at position 2 as present if there is an A in the word that is not at position 2 and not already accounted for by a correct guess. However, since we haven\'t revealed the position 3 A in the same guess, the system will mark the A at position 2 as present because there is an A in the word (at position 3) that hasn\'t been matched in this guess. So it doesn\'t necessarily mean two A\'s. It just means that the word has at least one A that is not at position 2. And we know that A is at position 3, so that explains it.\n\nTherefore, we don\'t need two A\'s. The word has one A at position 3, and when we put A at position 2 in ""fault"", it is marked as present (because there is an A in the word) but in the wrong position (because it\'s not at position 3). So the word has exactly one A, at position 3.\n\nSo the word is: _ _ A L _\n\nNow, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, F, U, T.\n\nWe also have L at position 4 and A at position 3.\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that fits: _ _ A L _\n\nWe must avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nWhat letters are left? We have not used: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word with the pattern _ _ A L _\n\nWe also have the feedback from ""fault"" that the A in position 2 was marked as present but wrong, but that was because the A is at position 3. So that doesn\'t give new information about other positions.\n\nBut note: in ""fault"", the L was at position 4 and correct. The other letters (F, A, U, T) were either absent or present but in wrong positions. We know F, U, T are absent. A is present but in the wrong position (which we know is because it\'s at position 3, not 2).\n\nSo we have no additional constraints from ""fault"" beyond the L at position 4 and the absence of F, U, T.\n\nNow, we need to choose a word that tests common letters and fits the pattern.\n\nPossible words: \n- We can try words with S, T is eliminated so not T. T is eliminated? In ""fault"", T was at the end and marked x, so T is not in the word.\n\nLet me list some words that fit _ _ A L _ and avoid C, R, N, E, F, U, T.\n\nExamples:\n- ""small"": S M A L L -> but has double L? The pattern is _ _ A L _, so the last letter is unknown. ""small"" has L at the end? Wait, ""small"" is S M A L L -> positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:A, 4:L, 5:L. But we don\'t know if double letters are allowed? The rules don\'t say they aren\'t. However, we have to check if L can be at the end? But we have L at position 4, and the fifth letter is unknown. In ""small"", the fourth letter is L and the fifth is L. That\'s possible. But we have to avoid eliminated letters. S and M are not eliminated. However, we have to see if it fits the feedback.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested S and M. Also, note that in ""small"", the fifth letter is L. But we don\'t know if that\'s allowed. Alternatively, we can try:\n\n- ""scalp"": but C is eliminated.\n- ""shalt"": but H and T? T is eliminated.\n- ""shale"": but E is eliminated.\n- ""shaly"": not common, but valid? Meaning of shale? But E is eliminated? Wait, ""shaly"" is an adjective from shale? But let\'s avoid if possible.\n\nBetter words:\n- ""spall"": S P A L L -> again double L. And P is new.\n- ""swell"": but E is eliminated and W is new, but the third letter is W? Not A.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A.\n\nAnother: ""dally"": D A L L Y -> but the pattern is _ _ A L _, so the third letter must be A. In ""dally"", the letters are: 1:D, 2:A, 3:L? No, that\'s not A at position 3.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A and the fourth to be L.\n\nSo: first two letters and last letter to be filled.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""small"" (S M A L L) -> but double L. The fifth letter is L, which is the same as the fourth? That\'s allowed.\n- ""shall"" (S H A L L) -> again double L.\n- ""spall"" (S P A L L) -> double L.\n- ""scald"" (S C A L D) -> but C is eliminated.\n- ""scalp"" (S C A L P) -> C eliminated.\n- ""balmy"" (B A L M Y) -> but the pattern: B at 1, A at 2, L at 3? But we need A at 3 and L at 4. So not.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A and the fourth to be L. So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] A L [letter5]\n\nSo the structure is: 1:?, 2:?, 3:A, 4:L, 5:?\n\nAvoiding C, R, N, E, F, U, T.\n\nLet me think of words:\n- ""small"": S M A L L -> letter5 is L. So the word would be S M A L L. But then we have two L\'s? That\'s acceptable.\n- ""shall"": S H A L L -> same.\n- ""swell"": S W E L L -> but E is eliminated and the third letter is E, not A.\n\nAnother: ""dials"": D I A L S -> but that\'s D at 1, I at 2, A at 3, L at 4, S at 5. That fits. And no eliminated letters? D, I, S are not eliminated.\n\nBut wait, in ""dials"", the fourth letter is L, which is correct, and the third is A, correct. The other letters: D, I, S are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""vials"": V I A L S -> V is new.\n\nBut we can also consider ""bialy"" (a type of bread) but that\'s B I A L Y -> B at 1, I at 2, A at 3, L at 4, Y at 5. That fits.\n\nBut let\'s choose a common word. ""Small"" is common, but it has double L. We don\'t know if the word has double letters. We should test new letters.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we can test multiple letters.\n\nWe want to maximize information. Since we know positions 3 and 4, we can focus on testing the first, second, and fifth positions.\n\nWe can choose a word that has many common letters that we haven\'t tested.\n\nFor example, use S, H, and then a common vowel for the fifth? But the fifth can be a consonant.\n\nList of common consonants: S, T (but T is eliminated), L is already known, so not new. We need to test new letters.\n\nWe have not tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nI think ""small"" is a good candidate because it tests S and M, and if the fifth letter is L, we\'ll know. But if it\'s not, then we get information.\n\nAlternatively, ""shall"" tests S and H.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nWe can also consider ""shalt"", but T is eliminated.\n\nAnother word: ""spall"" (S P A L L) tests S and P.\n\nBut I think ""dials"" is good because it tests D, I, and S.\n\nSimilarly, ""vials"" tests V, I, S.\n\nBut let\'s choose one that has distinct letters to maximize information.\n\nIn ""dials"": D, I, A, L, S -> all distinct except A and L are known. But we are testing D, I, S.\n\nSimilarly, ""bialy"" has B, I, A, L, Y -> distinct.\n\nBut ""bialy"" is less common.\n\nAnother common word: ""koala"" but that has O and A at the end? K O A L A -> but the pattern: 1:K, 2:O, 3:A, 4:L, 5:A. So it fits. And we test K, O, and A (but A is known). However, we have two A\'s? But we think there is only one A? Wait, in this word, there are two A\'s. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. We thought only one, but it could have two.\n\nBut in our earlier reasoning, we thought one A because the feedback for ""fault"" could be explained by one A. However, it is possible that there are two A\'s. We don\'t know for sure.\n\nBut in ""koala"", the fifth letter is A. If the secret word has only one A at position 3, then the A at position 5 would be marked as absent? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo be safe, let\'s avoid assuming the number of A\'s.\n\nBut in our pattern, we have A at position 3 and L at position 4. The fifth letter is unknown.\n\nWe can try ""koala"", but it has O and K, and we haven\'t tested them. However, it has two A\'s, which might complicate.\n\nI think ""small"" is a solid choice because it\'s common and tests S and M.\n\nBut ""small"" has two L\'s. The fourth letter is L and the fifth is L. So if the secret word has only one L, then the fifth L in ""small"" would be marked as absent? But we know the fourth L is correct, so the fifth L might be absent if there\'s no second L.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has one or two L\'s.\n\nSimilarly, in ""dials"", all letters are distinct.\n\nI think ""dials"" is a good guess.\n\nLet me check if ""dials"" is a valid word: yes, it is the plural of dial.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""dials"".\n\nWe can also consider ""shale"", but E is eliminated.\n\nAnother: ""scalp"" but C is eliminated.\n\n""papal"" has P and A, but the pattern: P A P A L -> 1:P, 2:A, 3:P, 4:A? Not matching. We need A at 3 and L at 4.\n\nSo ""papal"" is P A P A L -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:P, 4:A, 5:L -> not matching.\n\n""label"": L A B E L -> but E is eliminated and the pattern: 1:L, 2:A, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L -> not matching because we need A at 3 and L at 4? Here A is at 2 and L at 1 and 5.\n\nNot matching.\n\nSo ""dials"" seems good.\n\nWe can also do ""ovals"": O V A L S -> O, V, A, L, S. Fits the pattern. Tests O, V, S.\n\nBut ""dials"" tests D, I, S.\n\nI think both are fine. I\'ll choose ""dials"".\n\nSo the next guess is ""dials"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: \nPosition 1: D\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: A (correct)\nPosition 4: L (correct)\nPosition 5: S\n\nWe hope to get feedback on D, I, and S.\n\nIf the word is ""small"", then we would get: D(x), I(x), A(✓), L(✓), S(?) but if the secret word is ""small"", then S is in position 1, so D and I would be absent, and S would be present but in the wrong position? Because in ""dials"", S is at position 5, but in ""small"", S is at position 1. So if the secret word is ""small"", then for ""dials"": \n- D: not in word -> x\n- I: not in word -> x\n- A: correct position -> ✓\n- L: correct position -> ✓\n- S: in the word but not at position 5 (it\'s at position 1) -> marked as present but wrong position (-)\n\nBut we don\'t know the secret word yet.\n\nAlternatively, if the secret word is ""vital"", but T is eliminated and the pattern doesn\'t match because ""vital"" is V I T A L -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:T, 4:A, 5:L -> not matching because we need A at 3 and L at 4.\n\nSo ""dials"" is a safe guess.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""dials"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)  \n  This confirms that the third letter is **A** (position 3 is correct), and the letters C, R, N, E are **not** in the word.\n\n- **Guess 2: fault** → Feedback: F(x) A(-) U(x) L(✓) T(x)  \n  This confirms that the fourth letter is **L** (position 4 is correct). The A is in the word but **not** in position 2 (which aligns with position 3 being A). F, U, T are **not** in the word.\n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A L _` (A in position 3, L in position 4).\n- Eliminated letters: **C, R, N, E, F, U, T** (cannot appear anywhere).\n- The A in ""fault"" (position 2) was marked as present but wrong position, but since position 3 is already confirmed as A, this suggests the word has **only one A** (no duplicates).\n- Remaining letters to test: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, V, W, Y, etc.\n\n### Strategy for this guess:\n- Test new common letters (e.g., S, D, I) in positions 1, 2, and 5 to gather more information.\n- Prioritize words that fit `_ _ A L _` and avoid eliminated letters.\n- **""dials""** is chosen because:\n  - It tests **D** (position 1), **I** (position 2), and **S** (position 5)—all new, unused letters.\n  - It is a valid 5-letter word (plural of ""dial"").\n  - It maximizes feedback potential: if any of D, I, or S are correct or present, it narrows down possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>dials</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: fault -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(-) U(x) L(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: dials -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(x) A(✓) L(✓) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)  
   - A is correct and in position 3.
   - C, R, N, E are absent.

2. **fault**: F(x), A(-), U(x), L(✓), T(x)  
   - L is correct and in position 4.
   - A is present but not in position 2 (which we know is because A is fixed at position 3).
   - F, U, T are absent.

3. **dials**: D(x), I(x), A(✓), L(✓), S(-)  
   - A and L are correct in positions 3 and 4 (as expected).
   - D and I are absent.
   - S is present but not in position 5 (marked as -).

### Key Information:
- **Pattern**: The word is `_ _ A L _` (positions 3 and 4 fixed as A and L).
- **Correct letters so far**: A (pos 3), L (pos 4).
- **Present but misplaced**: S (not in position 5, but somewhere else).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, F, U, T, D, I.
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, V, W, Y, and possibly others not eliminated.

### Analysis:
- Since S is present but not in position 5, it must be in either position 1 or 2 (the only positions left).
- The word structure: `[pos1] [pos2] A L [pos5]`
- S is in the word but not at pos5 → so S must be at pos1 or pos2.

### Possible Positions for S:
- If S is at pos1, the word is `S _ A L _`.
- If S is at pos2, the word is `_ S A L _`.

### Eliminated Letters:
- Absent: C, R, N, E, F, U, T, D, I.
- So available consonants: B, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, and vowels: O (since A is already used, and we have O left; note that we don't know about O yet).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to test the position of S and find the missing letters (pos1, pos2, pos5).
- We should also test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.
- Since we have two cases for S (pos1 or pos2), we can choose a word that:
  - Includes S in either pos1 or pos2 (to confirm its position).
  - Tests new common letters for the other positions.

### Brainstorming Words:
- We need a word of the form `X Y A L Z`, where:
  - X and Y are from the available letters, and Z is from available letters.
  - S must be either X or Y (since it can't be Z, as per feedback).

#### Option 1: Assume S is in position 1 (word: `S ? A L ?`)
- Possible words: 
  - ""small"" (S M A L L) → but we have to test M and L (but L is already known, and double L is possible). However, we don't know if the word has double letters.
  - ""shall"" (S H A L L) → similar.
  - ""swale"" (S W A L E) → but E is eliminated.
  - ""scale"" → C eliminated.
  - ""shale"" → E eliminated.
  - ""spall"" (S P A L L) → tests P and double L.

#### Option 2: Assume S is in position 2 (word: `? S A L ?`)
- Possible words:
  - ""psalm"" (P S A L M) → tests P and M.
  - ""isled"" → I and E eliminated.
  - ""usual"" → U eliminated.
  - ""basal"" (B A S A L) → but the pattern requires A at pos3, so this is B A S A L → positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:S, 4:A, 5:L → doesn't match (we need pos3=A, pos4=L). So invalid.
  - ""cabal"" → C eliminated.

### Choosing a Guess:
- We need to test both possibilities (S at pos1 or pos2) and also test new letters.
- We can choose a word that has S in position 1 and tests common letters for pos2 and pos5.

### Proposed Guess: ""small""
- Why ""small""?
  - It has S at position 1 (testing if S is indeed at pos1).
  - It tests M at position 2 and L at position 5 (but L is already known to be in the word, so if the word has only one L, then the L at pos5 might be absent; if two L's, it might be present).
  - However, note that in ""small"", the L at position 4 is the same as the known L? But we have L at position 4 already correct, so if the word has only one L, then the L at position 5 in ""small"" would be marked as absent. If it has two L's, it might be present.

But we have a risk: if the word does not have two L's, then the feedback for the fifth letter (L) will be absent, but we already know L is in the word (at pos4). So it doesn't give new information about other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeating L to test new letters.

### Better Guess: ""shalm"" or ""shalt""? But ""shalt"" has T (eliminated). ""shalm"" is not a word.

Another idea: ""swamp"" but the pattern: S W A M P → positions 1:S, 2:W, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P → but we need position 4 to be L, not M. So invalid.

We must keep position 4 as L.

So words must have A at 3 and L at 4.

### Another word: ""psalm"" (P S A L M)
- This has S at position 2 (so it tests the other case).
- It tests P at position 1 and M at position 5.
- Both P and M are new letters.

But we don't know if S is at position 1 or 2. By guessing ""psalm"", we are testing S at position 2.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has S in position 1 and new letters elsewhere.

### Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters:

- With S at pos1: 
  - ""small"" (S M A L L) → tests M and double L.
  - ""shall"" (S H A L L) → tests H and double L.
  - ""swaly"" (not common) or ""shaly"" (S H A L Y) → tests H and Y.

- With S at pos2:
  - ""psalm"" (P S A L M) → tests P and M.
  - ""oswal"" (not a word) → no.
  - ""basal"" doesn't fit as explained.

Another word: ""smalt"" (S M A L T) → but T is eliminated.

""spall"" (S P A L L) → tests P and double L.

### Decision:
- We have limited guesses left (3 more), so we need to maximize information.
- Since S must be in pos1 or pos2, we can choose a word that tests one of these and introduces two new letters.

I propose **""shall""**:
- S at position 1 (testing if S is at pos1).
- H at position 2 (new letter).
- Double L at the end (so the fifth letter is L, which we can test for duplication).

If we guess ""shall"":
- If S is indeed at pos1, then S will be marked as correct (✓) or if not, then we know S must be at pos2.
- But in ""shall"", S is at pos1, so if the secret word has S at pos1, we get S(✓). If not, then S must be at pos2, and we'll get S(-) for this guess? No, because if S is at pos2, then in ""shall"" (with S at pos1), the S at pos1 would be marked as absent (x) if there's only one S? But we don't know if the word has one or two S's.

But from the feedback of ""dials"", we know S is present and not at pos5, but we don't know if it appears once or twice. So it could be that the word has two S's? But we have no evidence of that.

To avoid confusion, let's choose a word without repeating S and without using eliminated letters.

### Better: ""shaly"" (if valid) → S H A L Y. 
- ""Shaly"" is an adjective (meaning resembling shale). It's acceptable.
- It tests S at pos1, H at pos2, and Y at pos5.

But let's see if there's a more common word.

Another option: ""shawl"" (S H A W L) → but then the pattern: S H A W L → positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:W, 5:L → but we need position 4 to be L, not W. So invalid.

We must have L at position 4.

So ""shawl"" is not valid for our pattern.

### Revised Plan: Guess ""psalm""
- ""psalm"" (P S A L M) → positions: 1:P, 2:S, 3:A, 4:L, 5:M
- This tests:
  - P at pos1 (new)
  - S at pos2 (if S is at pos2, we get S(✓) or S(-) if misplaced, but we know S is present so it will be either ✓ or -)
  - A and L are fixed and correct (✓)
  - M at pos5 (new)

If S is at pos2, then in ""psalm"", S at pos2 would be correct (✓). If S is at pos1, then in ""psalm"", S at pos2 would be marked as present but wrong position (-) only if there is another S? But if the word has only one S and it is at pos1, then S at pos2 in ""psalm"" would be absent (x). But we know S is in the word, so if we get x for S in this guess, then S must be at pos1.

So by guessing ""psalm"", we can determine the position of S:

- If S is at pos2: we get S(✓) in this guess.
- If S is at pos1: we get S(x) in this guess (because the only S is at pos1, so the S at pos2 is not present, hence absent).

But note: the feedback for S in ""dials"" was (-), meaning present but not at pos5. It doesn't specify the count. So if the word has only one S, then:

- If S is at pos1: in ""psalm"" (S at pos2), we get S(x) for that position.
- If S is at pos2: in ""psalm"", we get S(✓).

Additionally, we test P and M.

### Alternatively, guess ""small"":
- ""small"" (S M A L L) → positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:A, 4:L, 5:L
- If S is at pos1, we get S(✓) if correct, or S(-) if present but wrong (but if S is at pos1, it should be ✓ if the word starts with S). 
- But if S is at pos2, then in ""small"", S at pos1 would be absent (x) if there's only one S.

So similarly, we can determine the position of S.

But ""small"" has double L at the end. We don't know if the secret word has a double L. If it doesn't, then the fifth letter L will be marked as absent (x), which tells us that there is no second L. But we already know one L at pos4.

### Let's choose ""psalm"" to avoid the double letter complication.

So I'll go with **""psalm""**.

<guess>psalm</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Pattern established**: The word must be `_ _ A L _` (A in position 3, L in position 4).
- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, R, N, E, F, U, T, D, I (cannot appear).
- **Key insight from last guess (dials)**: S is present but **not in position 5**, so it must be in **position 1 or 2**.
- **Available letters**: B, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, V, W, Y, etc.

### Strategy for this guess:
- Test the position of S (pos1 vs. pos2) while probing new common letters.
- **""psalm""** is chosen because:
  - Puts S in **position 2** (to test if S belongs there).
  - Tests **P** (position 1) and **M** (position 5)—both new, high-frequency letters.
  - Maintains A (pos3) and L (pos4) as confirmed.
  - Avoids all eliminated letters.

<guess>psalm</guess>",psalm,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)  
   - A is correct and in position 3.
   - C, R, N, E are absent.

2. **fault**: F(x), A(-), U(x), L(✓), T(x)  
   - L is correct and in position 4.
   - A is present but not in position 2 (which we know is because A is fixed at position 3).
   - F, U, T are absent.

3. **dials**: D(x), I(x), A(✓), L(✓), S(-)  
   - A and L are correct in positions 3 and 4 (as expected).
   - D and I are absent.
   - S is present but not in position 5 (marked as -).

### Key Information:
- **Pattern**: The word is `_ _ A L _` (positions 3 and 4 fixed as A and L).
- **Correct letters so far**: A (pos 3), L (pos 4).
- **Present but misplaced**: S (not in position 5, but somewhere else).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, F, U, T, D, I.
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, V, W, Y, and possibly others not eliminated.

### Analysis:
- Since S is present but not in position 5, it must be in either position 1 or 2 (the only positions left).
- The word structure: `[pos1] [pos2] A L [pos5]`
- S is in the word but not at pos5 → so S must be at pos1 or pos2.

### Possible Positions for S:
- If S is at pos1, the word is `S _ A L _`.
- If S is at pos2, the word is `_ S A L _`.

### Eliminated Letters:
- Absent: C, R, N, E, F, U, T, D, I.
- So available consonants: B, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, and vowels: O (since A is already used, and we have O left; note that we don't know about O yet).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to test the position of S and find the missing letters (pos1, pos2, pos5).
- We should also test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.
- Since we have two cases for S (pos1 or pos2), we can choose a word that:
  - Includes S in either pos1 or pos2 (to confirm its position).
  - Tests new common letters for the other positions.

### Brainstorming Words:
- We need a word of the form `X Y A L Z`, where:
  - X and Y are from the available letters, and Z is from available letters.
  - S must be either X or Y (since it can't be Z, as per feedback).

#### Option 1: Assume S is in position 1 (word: `S ? A L ?`)
- Possible words: 
  - ""small"" (S M A L L) → but we have to test M and L (but L is already known, and double L is possible). However, we don't know if the word has double letters.
  - ""shall"" (S H A L L) → similar.
  - ""swale"" (S W A L E) → but E is eliminated.
  - ""scale"" → C eliminated.
  - ""shale"" → E eliminated.
  - ""spall"" (S P A L L) → tests P and double L.

#### Option 2: Assume S is in position 2 (word: `? S A L ?`)
- Possible words:
  - ""psalm"" (P S A L M) → tests P and M.
  - ""isled"" → I and E eliminated.
  - ""usual"" → U eliminated.
  - ""basal"" (B A S A L) → but the pattern requires A at pos3, so this is B A S A L → positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:S, 4:A, 5:L → doesn't match (we need pos3=A, pos4=L). So invalid.
  - ""cabal"" → C eliminated.

### Choosing a Guess:
- We need to test both possibilities (S at pos1 or pos2) and also test new letters.
- We can choose a word that has S in position 1 and tests common letters for pos2 and pos5.

### Proposed Guess: ""small""
- Why ""small""?
  - It has S at position 1 (testing if S is indeed at pos1).
  - It tests M at position 2 and L at position 5 (but L is already known to be in the word, so if the word has only one L, then the L at pos5 might be absent; if two L's, it might be present).
  - However, note that in ""small"", the L at position 4 is the same as the known L? But we have L at position 4 already correct, so if the word has only one L, then the L at position 5 in ""small"" would be marked as absent. If it has two L's, it might be present.

But we have a risk: if the word does not have two L's, then the feedback for the fifth letter (L) will be absent, but we already know L is in the word (at pos4). So it doesn't give new information about other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeating L to test new letters.

### Better Guess: ""shalm"" or ""shalt""? But ""shalt"" has T (eliminated). ""shalm"" is not a word.

Another idea: ""swamp"" but the pattern: S W A M P → positions 1:S, 2:W, 3:A, 4:M, 5:P → but we need position 4 to be L, not M. So invalid.

We must keep position 4 as L.

So words must have A at 3 and L at 4.

### Another word: ""psalm"" (P S A L M)
- This has S at position 2 (so it tests the other case).
- It tests P at position 1 and M at position 5.
- Both P and M are new letters.

But we don't know if S is at position 1 or 2. By guessing ""psalm"", we are testing S at position 2.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has S in position 1 and new letters elsewhere.

### Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters:

- With S at pos1: 
  - ""small"" (S M A L L) → tests M and double L.
  - ""shall"" (S H A L L) → tests H and double L.
  - ""swaly"" (not common) or ""shaly"" (S H A L Y) → tests H and Y.

- With S at pos2:
  - ""psalm"" (P S A L M) → tests P and M.
  - ""oswal"" (not a word) → no.
  - ""basal"" doesn't fit as explained.

Another word: ""smalt"" (S M A L T) → but T is eliminated.

""spall"" (S P A L L) → tests P and double L.

### Decision:
- We have limited guesses left (3 more), so we need to maximize information.
- Since S must be in pos1 or pos2, we can choose a word that tests one of these and introduces two new letters.

I propose **""shall""**:
- S at position 1 (testing if S is at pos1).
- H at position 2 (new letter).
- Double L at the end (so the fifth letter is L, which we can test for duplication).

If we guess ""shall"":
- If S is indeed at pos1, then S will be marked as correct (✓) or if not, then we know S must be at pos2.
- But in ""shall"", S is at pos1, so if the secret word has S at pos1, we get S(✓). If not, then S must be at pos2, and we'll get S(-) for this guess? No, because if S is at pos2, then in ""shall"" (with S at pos1), the S at pos1 would be marked as absent (x) if there's only one S? But we don't know if the word has one or two S's.

But from the feedback of ""dials"", we know S is present and not at pos5, but we don't know if it appears once or twice. So it could be that the word has two S's? But we have no evidence of that.

To avoid confusion, let's choose a word without repeating S and without using eliminated letters.

### Better: ""shaly"" (if valid) → S H A L Y. 
- ""Shaly"" is an adjective (meaning resembling shale). It's acceptable.
- It tests S at pos1, H at pos2, and Y at pos5.

But let's see if there's a more common word.

Another option: ""shawl"" (S H A W L) → but then the pattern: S H A W L → positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:W, 5:L → but we need position 4 to be L, not W. So invalid.

We must have L at position 4.

So ""shawl"" is not valid for our pattern.

### Revised Plan: Guess ""psalm""
- ""psalm"" (P S A L M) → positions: 1:P, 2:S, 3:A, 4:L, 5:M
- This tests:
  - P at pos1 (new)
  - S at pos2 (if S is at pos2, we get S(✓) or S(-) if misplaced, but we know S is present so it will be either ✓ or -)
  - A and L are fixed and correct (✓)
  - M at pos5 (new)

If S is at pos2, then in ""psalm"", S at pos2 would be correct (✓). If S is at pos1, then in ""psalm"", S at pos2 would be marked as present but wrong position (-) only if there is another S? But if the word has only one S and it is at pos1, then S at pos2 in ""psalm"" would be absent (x). But we know S is in the word, so if we get x for S in this guess, then S must be at pos1.

So by guessing ""psalm"", we can determine the position of S:

- If S is at pos2: we get S(✓) in this guess.
- If S is at pos1: we get S(x) in this guess (because the only S is at pos1, so the S at pos2 is not present, hence absent).

But note: the feedback for S in ""dials"" was (-), meaning present but not at pos5. It doesn't specify the count. So if the word has only one S, then:

- If S is at pos1: in ""psalm"" (S at pos2), we get S(x) for that position.
- If S is at pos2: in ""psalm"", we get S(✓).

Additionally, we test P and M.

### Alternatively, guess ""small"":
- ""small"" (S M A L L) → positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:A, 4:L, 5:L
- If S is at pos1, we get S(✓) if correct, or S(-) if present but wrong (but if S is at pos1, it should be ✓ if the word starts with S). 
- But if S is at pos2, then in ""small"", S at pos1 would be absent (x) if there's only one S.

So similarly, we can determine the position of S.

But ""small"" has double L at the end. We don't know if the secret word has a double L. If it doesn't, then the fifth letter L will be marked as absent (x), which tells us that there is no second L. But we already know one L at pos4.

### Let's choose ""psalm"" to avoid the double letter complication.

So I'll go with **""psalm""**.
