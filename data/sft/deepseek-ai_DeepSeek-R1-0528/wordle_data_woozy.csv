We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. This covers 5 common letters and includes two vowels (A and E).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: 
 The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have excluded 5: C, R, A, N, E.

 Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
 Remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are excluded)

 We should try to cover as many common letters as possible. Common letters in English include S, T, L, O, etc.

 Since we have no information, we want a word that uses common letters from the remaining set.

 Some common letters from the remaining set: S, T, L, O, I, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

 We can try a word that has a mix of vowels and consonants. For example, using O and I as vowels.

 Possible words: 
   - ""TOILS"" -> but we don't know if S is available? Actually, we haven't ruled out S. However, we must avoid the excluded letters.

 Let's list words without C, R, A, N, E.

 Some options:
   - ""GHOUL"" -> 5 letters? No, that's 5: G, H, O, U, L -> but we have 5 letters? Actually, ""ghoul"" is 5 letters.
   - ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S -> 5 letters.

 However, we might want to use more common letters. Let's try:

   - ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H -> all are allowed? Yes, because none of these are in {C, R, A, N, E}.
   - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> also allowed.

 But note: we want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters. The most common consonants left are S, T, L, and then M, P, etc. and vowels O, I.

 Another good candidate: ""OUIJA"" is not common and has J which is less common.

 Alternatively, ""PILOT"" -> P, I, L, O, T -> but L and T are common.

 However, we must ensure the word is valid.

 Let me choose ""MOIST"" because it uses M, O, I, S, T which are common and we haven't tried.

 But note: we are avoiding E and A, so we have to use O, I, U. ""MOIST"" uses O and I.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"" -> S, H, O, U, T -> also valid.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it covers two vowels (O, I) and three common consonants (M, S, T).

 However, we have to be cautious: we don't know if the word has duplicates? But the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates so far, but the secret word might have duplicates. But we are not using any duplicate in our guess.

 Let's go with ""MOIST"".

 But wait, what about ""BUILD""? B, U, I, L, D -> but we don't have B, D, L in the excluded set. However, we haven't tried B or D. But we want to cover more common letters? S and T are more common than B and D.

 Another option: ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> but Y is sometimes a vowel, and we have O and U.

 However, I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.

 Alternatively, ""HOIST"" is similar to ""MOIST"" but with H instead of M. H is less common than M? Actually, both are common.

 But we are going for maximum coverage. Since we have no information, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 We are going to use ""MOIST"".

 So, the next guess: ""moist""

 Format: <guess>moist</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (all letters marked as ""x""), I know that the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For my next guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely to test new common letters. 

I'll prioritize frequent consonants like S, T, L, M, and vowels like O, I, U. A good candidate is **""moist""** because:
- It uses 5 new, common letters (M, O, I, S, T).
- It covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants.
- It avoids the excluded letters from the first guess.

This guess maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback by testing high-frequency letters not yet attempted.

We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. Guess: crane -> All letters (C,R,A,N,E) are not in the secret word. So we exclude C,R,A,N,E.
2. Guess: moist -> Feedback: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
   This tells us:
      - O is in the word and in the correct position (since it got a checkmark). Specifically, O is the second letter because in ""moist"", O is at position 2 (positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T).
   Therefore, the second letter of the secret word is O.
   Also, M, I, S, T are not in the word. So we can exclude M, I, S, T.

Now, we know:
   Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T
   Required: The second letter is O.

We need to guess a 5-letter word that:
   - Has O as the second letter.
   - Contains none of the excluded letters (C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T).
   - Uses other letters from the English alphabet.

Remaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We also note that we have not used many common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are O (but we already know the position) and U (and sometimes Y). But O is already placed, so we need to use other vowels? Actually, we don't know if there are other vowels in the word. The remaining vowels available: U, and Y (if considered vowel) or sometimes consonants? But we'll treat Y as a possible vowel.

We need to form a word in the form: _ O _ _ _ 

Possible letters for the other positions: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible to gather information.

Common remaining consonants: H, L, D, P, G, B, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (and Y).

Let's think of words that have O as the second letter and are composed of the remaining letters.

Some candidates:
   - G O L D ... but ""gold"" is only 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So we need 5-letter words.
   - Possible words: 
        * ""fouls"" -> but S is excluded? Wait, S is excluded from guess 2 (S was marked x). So we can't use S.
        * ""gouge"" -> E is excluded? E is excluded from guess 1 (E was marked x). So no.
        * ""pound"" -> P,O,U,N,D -> but N is excluded? In guess1, N was marked x -> excluded. So no N.
        * ""bough"": B,O,U,G,H -> letters: B,O,U,G,H. 
            - Check excluded: B, O (we know O is in, but we can use O again? Actually, the feedback for O was correct, but we don't know if there are multiple O's. The feedback only told us about one O. The feedback format does not explicitly show duplicates. However, if we use O again, we might get a '-' or 'x'. But note: we don't have any information about duplicate O's. However, in ""moist"", O was correct and the rest were not. So if the word had another O, it would have been marked by either '-' in another position or ✓ if in that same position? But we didn't have any other O. So we cannot rule out another O? But the word might contain O only once.

        However, we must avoid excluded letters: B is not excluded? We haven't tried B. So ""bough"" seems okay? 
        But we need to check the letters: 
            B: not excluded
            O: we know it's in the word, but we are placing it again? Actually, we are forced to put O in the second position. The word must have O in the second position. So we cannot put O in another position? Actually, we can, but we should avoid repeating letters if we aren't sure? Since we don't know if there is a duplicate, we can use letters we haven't tried.

        But let's look for words without duplicates unless necessary.

   - ""hobby"": H,O,B,B,Y -> duplicates B and Y. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Yes, but we don't know. However, we haven't tried H, B, Y so we might test new letters.

   - Better words:

        ""tough"" -> but T is excluded? In guess2, T was marked x -> excluded. So we cannot use T.

        ""could"" -> C and U and L and D: but C is excluded -> no.

        ""would"" -> W,O,U,L,D: W is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tried W. U and L and D are allowed? Yes. So ""would"" -> letters: W,O,U,L,D -> all except O are new.

        But we have excluded A,C,E,I,M,N,R,S,T -> so yes.

        ""would"": 
            Position: W (1), O (2), U (3), L (4), D (5)
            This uses new letters: W, U, L, D.

        Another word: ""joule"" -> J,O,U,L,E -> E is excluded? E was x in guess1 -> excluded. So not allowed.

        ""vouch"" -> V,O,U,C,H -> C is excluded? Yes -> no.

        ""pound"": P,O,U,N,D -> N is excluded? In guess1 N was x -> excluded. So no.

        ""boozy"": B,O,O,Z,Y -> has two O's? And Z and Y? 
            B, O, Z, Y -> all are allowed? We don't have any exclusion for these. So ""boozy"" is a word? Meaning: affected by alcohol, and it's 5 letters? Yes.

        But we don't know if the word has an O? But we are placing O in the second position. If there is another O, it might get a dash or an x? But we are primarily testing new letters.

        However, we might avoid duplicates because we don't know? Also, duplicate letters might complicate.

        Let's consider:

        ""boogy"" -> not a valid word? Actually, ""boggy"" has two G's -> but G is allowed? ""boggy"": B,O,G,G,Y -> but we haven't tried B,G,Y? Yes. And O is at position 2. But ""boggy"" is not a word? Valid word: ""bogey"" has E? E is excluded. Or ""boggy"" is valid? It means marshy. Yes.

        However, spelling: ""boggy"" -> 5 letters: B,O,G,G,Y. Second letter O.

        But we have two G's? We don't know how the feedback will handle duplicates? The secret word might have one G and then we might get one G marked and the other incorrect? It's tricky.

        We want to maximize new letters? So let's prefer a word without duplicates.

        Another word: ""dough"": D,O,U,G,H -> D,O,U,G,H -> all letters allowed? Yes. And all letters are new? Yes: D,O (we know O but we are testing new letters otherwise).

        ""dough"" is a valid word.

        ""booth"": B,O,O,T,H -> T is excluded from guess2? Yes, T was marked x -> excluded. So we cannot use T.

        ""brook"": B,R,... R is excluded -> no.

        Good options:
          - ""dough"": D,O,U,G,H -> letters D,U,G,H are new.
          - ""fouls"": F,O,U,L,S -> but S is excluded? Guess2: S was marked x -> excluded. So cannot use S.

        ""gouge"": G,O,U,G,E -> E excluded? Yes -> no.

        ""proud"": P,R,... R excluded -> no.

        ""wound"": W,O,U,N,D -> N excluded? Yes -> no.

        ""louse"": L,O,U,S,E -> S and E excluded -> no.

        ""boule"": B,O,U,L,E -> E excluded -> no.

        ""bound"": B,O,U,N,D -> N excluded -> no.

        ""hound"": H,O,U,N,D -> N excluded -> no.

        ""would"": W,O,U,L,D -> no excluded letters? We have W,O,U,L,D -> O is allowed, and W,U,L,D not excluded? Correct.

        ""would"": 
            W: not excluded? 
            U: not excluded? 
            L: not excluded? 
            D: not excluded?

        So yes.

        Another: ""could"" -> C excluded -> no.

        How about ""gowdy""? Not common. Or ""jowly"": J,O,W,L,Y -> valid word? Meaning: having prominent jowls. So letters J,O,W,L,Y -> all allowed? Yes.

        But J and Y are less common? We might avoid them? Or test? Since we need to cover letters.

        Alternatively, ""bowly"" is not a word.

        ""howdy"": H,O,W,D,Y -> valid. So ""howdy"" -> H,O,W,D,Y.

        Comparing ""would"", ""dough"", ""howdy"", and ""jowly"".

        We already have ""dough"" which uses D,U,G,H -> G and H are common? Yes.

        So let's list the words we can use:
          - ""would"": tests W,U,L,D -> positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:U, 4:L, 5:D
          - ""dough"": tests D,U,G,H -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:G, 5:H
          - ""howdy"": tests H,O,W,D,Y -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:W, 4:D, 5:Y
          - ""jowly"": tests J,O,W,L,Y -> positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:W, 4:L, 5:Y

        Since we don't have any information on vowels? We haven't tried U? So we might want to test U? So ""would"" or ""dough"" or ""howdy"" have U or Y? ""howdy"" has Y.

        It's a trade-off: 
          - ""dough"": covers D,U,G,H -> 4 new letters? Actually 5: D,O,U,G,H -> O we know is there, but we are testing the others.
          - ""would"": covers W,U,L,D -> also 4 new letters (if we don't count O) -> but we are testing W,U,L,D.
          - ""howdy"": tests H,O,W,D,Y -> H,W,D,Y -> 4 new letters? O is known. But we haven't tried H,W,D,Y.

        But note: we have only excluded C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T -> so 9 letters. We have many left.

        Another word: ""gulpy"" -> G,U,L,P,Y -> but O must be in second position? So ""gulpy"" is G,U,L,P,Y -> O not at position 2? So not.

        We need O at position 2.

        Another: ""folky"" -> F,O,L,K,Y -> K is allowed? Yes. But L is allowed? Yes. F,O,L,K,Y -> but we don't know about F,K,Y? So ""folky"": F,O,L,K,Y -> positions: 1:F,2:O,3:L,4:K,5:Y -> but we haven't tried F,L,K,Y? Yes.

        However, we must check: we haven't excluded F,L,K,Y? Correct.

        So options: 
          - ""would"", ""dough"", ""howdy"", ""folky"", ""jowly"", ""boxdy"" (not a word).

        Now, we want to test common letters? 
        Common letters remaining: L, D, U, G, H, P, B, etc.

        Actually, after excluding C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T, the next most common letters in English are: O (already known), then D, L, U, G, H, B, P.

        Therefore, we might choose a word that includes D, L, or U? And avoid rare letters like J, Z, etc.

        Let's prioritize:

          ""would"": uses W (uncommon), U, L (common), D (common) -> common: U,L,D.
          ""dough"": uses D (common), U (vowel), G (common), H (common) -> common: D,U,G,H.
          ""howdy"": H (common), W (uncommon), D (common), Y (common? but not as much) -> common: H,D,Y? But we are testing Y which is less common.

        Therefore, ""dough"" seems to cover more common letters: D,U,G,H -> all common.

        However, note: we are guessing ""dough"": 
            D at position 1 -> is D in the word?
            O at position 2 -> known correct.
            U at position 3 -> is U in the word?
            G at position 4 -> is G in the word?
            H at position 5 -> is H in the word?

        Alternatively, ""dough"" uses all new letters and covers D,U,G,H which are common and not yet tested.

        There's another word: ""bough"": B,O,U,G,H -> same as dough but with B? B is allowed? Yes. And common? Less common than D? B and D are both common. But we might test more common letters? Actually D is more common? In terms of frequency: D is about 4.25% or less? But in any case, we want to test a variety.

        But ""dough"" is fine.

        Another word: ""pound"" -> but N excluded? No, ""pound"" has N -> excluded -> invalid.

        So I think ""dough"" is a valid and good candidate.

        However, we have the option ""foggy"": F,O,G,G,Y -> but duplicate G? We avoid duplicates? Unless necessary? Also, Y might be less common? So ""dough"" is better because no duplication.

        Let's choose ""dough"".

        So our guess: dough

        Format: <guess>dough</guess>

        But wait, is there a reason to choose ""would"" over ""dough""? 

        ""would"" would test U and L and D and W? But W is less common? And U is a vowel we haven't tested.

        Given that we have no information on vowels? We have excluded A, E, I -> so the remaining vowels are O and U? And we know O is in the word. There might be another vowel? Typically, words have at least two vowels? So U is a good candidate? So both ""dough"" and ""would"" test U? 

        Actually, ""dough"" and ""would"" both test U? 
          - ""dough"": has U at position 3: so we test U at position 3.
          - ""would"": has U at position 3: also.

        So they both test U? Then ""dough"" tests additionally G and H? And ""would"" tests L? 

        Since L is common, we might want to test it? 

        But we can decide arbitrarily? 

        Actually, we can also consider ""gouhy""? Not a word.

        Final choice: ""dough"" because it tests 4 consonants? Or we can try ""lurky""? Not valid.

        Alternatively, what about ""dougy""? Not valid.

        We'll go with ""dough"".

        So the guess: dough
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): Letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""moist""): 
  - M, I, S, T are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
  - O is correct and in the right position (marked ""✓"") → **The second letter is O**.

**Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, T  
**Known information**:  
- The secret word has 5 letters.  
- Second letter is O → Format: _ O _ _ _  

For the next guess:
- Must avoid excluded letters.  
- Focus on common unused letters (remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
- Prioritize testing vowels (like U) and frequent consonants (like D, G, H, L).  

A good candidate is **""dough""** because:  
- Second letter is O (required).  
- Tests new common letters: D, U, G, H (all untried).  
- Valid 5-letter word.  

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities by testing four new letters while leveraging the known ""O"" position.

<guess>dough</guess>",dough,"We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. Guess: crane -> All letters (C,R,A,N,E) are not in the secret word. So we exclude C,R,A,N,E.
2. Guess: moist -> Feedback: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
   This tells us:
      - O is in the word and in the correct position (since it got a checkmark). Specifically, O is the second letter because in ""moist"", O is at position 2 (positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T).
   Therefore, the second letter of the secret word is O.
   Also, M, I, S, T are not in the word. So we can exclude M, I, S, T.

Now, we know:
   Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T
   Required: The second letter is O.

We need to guess a 5-letter word that:
   - Has O as the second letter.
   - Contains none of the excluded letters (C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T).
   - Uses other letters from the English alphabet.

Remaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We also note that we have not used many common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are O (but we already know the position) and U (and sometimes Y). But O is already placed, so we need to use other vowels? Actually, we don't know if there are other vowels in the word. The remaining vowels available: U, and Y (if considered vowel) or sometimes consonants? But we'll treat Y as a possible vowel.

We need to form a word in the form: _ O _ _ _ 

Possible letters for the other positions: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible to gather information.

Common remaining consonants: H, L, D, P, G, B, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (and Y).

Let's think of words that have O as the second letter and are composed of the remaining letters.

Some candidates:
   - G O L D ... but ""gold"" is only 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So we need 5-letter words.
   - Possible words: 
        * ""fouls"" -> but S is excluded? Wait, S is excluded from guess 2 (S was marked x). So we can't use S.
        * ""gouge"" -> E is excluded? E is excluded from guess 1 (E was marked x). So no.
        * ""pound"" -> P,O,U,N,D -> but N is excluded? In guess1, N was marked x -> excluded. So no N.
        * ""bough"": B,O,U,G,H -> letters: B,O,U,G,H. 
            - Check excluded: B, O (we know O is in, but we can use O again? Actually, the feedback for O was correct, but we don't know if there are multiple O's. The feedback only told us about one O. The feedback format does not explicitly show duplicates. However, if we use O again, we might get a '-' or 'x'. But note: we don't have any information about duplicate O's. However, in ""moist"", O was correct and the rest were not. So if the word had another O, it would have been marked by either '-' in another position or ✓ if in that same position? But we didn't have any other O. So we cannot rule out another O? But the word might contain O only once.

        However, we must avoid excluded letters: B is not excluded? We haven't tried B. So ""bough"" seems okay? 
        But we need to check the letters: 
            B: not excluded
            O: we know it's in the word, but we are placing it again? Actually, we are forced to put O in the second position. The word must have O in the second position. So we cannot put O in another position? Actually, we can, but we should avoid repeating letters if we aren't sure? Since we don't know if there is a duplicate, we can use letters we haven't tried.

        But let's look for words without duplicates unless necessary.

   - ""hobby"": H,O,B,B,Y -> duplicates B and Y. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Yes, but we don't know. However, we haven't tried H, B, Y so we might test new letters.

   - Better words:

        ""tough"" -> but T is excluded? In guess2, T was marked x -> excluded. So we cannot use T.

        ""could"" -> C and U and L and D: but C is excluded -> no.

        ""would"" -> W,O,U,L,D: W is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tried W. U and L and D are allowed? Yes. So ""would"" -> letters: W,O,U,L,D -> all except O are new.

        But we have excluded A,C,E,I,M,N,R,S,T -> so yes.

        ""would"": 
            Position: W (1), O (2), U (3), L (4), D (5)
            This uses new letters: W, U, L, D.

        Another word: ""joule"" -> J,O,U,L,E -> E is excluded? E was x in guess1 -> excluded. So not allowed.

        ""vouch"" -> V,O,U,C,H -> C is excluded? Yes -> no.

        ""pound"": P,O,U,N,D -> N is excluded? In guess1 N was x -> excluded. So no.

        ""boozy"": B,O,O,Z,Y -> has two O's? And Z and Y? 
            B, O, Z, Y -> all are allowed? We don't have any exclusion for these. So ""boozy"" is a word? Meaning: affected by alcohol, and it's 5 letters? Yes.

        But we don't know if the word has an O? But we are placing O in the second position. If there is another O, it might get a dash or an x? But we are primarily testing new letters.

        However, we might avoid duplicates because we don't know? Also, duplicate letters might complicate.

        Let's consider:

        ""boogy"" -> not a valid word? Actually, ""boggy"" has two G's -> but G is allowed? ""boggy"": B,O,G,G,Y -> but we haven't tried B,G,Y? Yes. And O is at position 2. But ""boggy"" is not a word? Valid word: ""bogey"" has E? E is excluded. Or ""boggy"" is valid? It means marshy. Yes.

        However, spelling: ""boggy"" -> 5 letters: B,O,G,G,Y. Second letter O.

        But we have two G's? We don't know how the feedback will handle duplicates? The secret word might have one G and then we might get one G marked and the other incorrect? It's tricky.

        We want to maximize new letters? So let's prefer a word without duplicates.

        Another word: ""dough"": D,O,U,G,H -> D,O,U,G,H -> all letters allowed? Yes. And all letters are new? Yes: D,O (we know O but we are testing new letters otherwise).

        ""dough"" is a valid word.

        ""booth"": B,O,O,T,H -> T is excluded from guess2? Yes, T was marked x -> excluded. So we cannot use T.

        ""brook"": B,R,... R is excluded -> no.

        Good options:
          - ""dough"": D,O,U,G,H -> letters D,U,G,H are new.
          - ""fouls"": F,O,U,L,S -> but S is excluded? Guess2: S was marked x -> excluded. So cannot use S.

        ""gouge"": G,O,U,G,E -> E excluded? Yes -> no.

        ""proud"": P,R,... R excluded -> no.

        ""wound"": W,O,U,N,D -> N excluded? Yes -> no.

        ""louse"": L,O,U,S,E -> S and E excluded -> no.

        ""boule"": B,O,U,L,E -> E excluded -> no.

        ""bound"": B,O,U,N,D -> N excluded -> no.

        ""hound"": H,O,U,N,D -> N excluded -> no.

        ""would"": W,O,U,L,D -> no excluded letters? We have W,O,U,L,D -> O is allowed, and W,U,L,D not excluded? Correct.

        ""would"": 
            W: not excluded? 
            U: not excluded? 
            L: not excluded? 
            D: not excluded?

        So yes.

        Another: ""could"" -> C excluded -> no.

        How about ""gowdy""? Not common. Or ""jowly"": J,O,W,L,Y -> valid word? Meaning: having prominent jowls. So letters J,O,W,L,Y -> all allowed? Yes.

        But J and Y are less common? We might avoid them? Or test? Since we need to cover letters.

        Alternatively, ""bowly"" is not a word.

        ""howdy"": H,O,W,D,Y -> valid. So ""howdy"" -> H,O,W,D,Y.

        Comparing ""would"", ""dough"", ""howdy"", and ""jowly"".

        We already have ""dough"" which uses D,U,G,H -> G and H are common? Yes.

        So let's list the words we can use:
          - ""would"": tests W,U,L,D -> positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:U, 4:L, 5:D
          - ""dough"": tests D,U,G,H -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:G, 5:H
          - ""howdy"": tests H,O,W,D,Y -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:W, 4:D, 5:Y
          - ""jowly"": tests J,O,W,L,Y -> positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:W, 4:L, 5:Y

        Since we don't have any information on vowels? We haven't tried U? So we might want to test U? So ""would"" or ""dough"" or ""howdy"" have U or Y? ""howdy"" has Y.

        It's a trade-off: 
          - ""dough"": covers D,U,G,H -> 4 new letters? Actually 5: D,O,U,G,H -> O we know is there, but we are testing the others.
          - ""would"": covers W,U,L,D -> also 4 new letters (if we don't count O) -> but we are testing W,U,L,D.
          - ""howdy"": tests H,O,W,D,Y -> H,W,D,Y -> 4 new letters? O is known. But we haven't tried H,W,D,Y.

        But note: we have only excluded C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T -> so 9 letters. We have many left.

        Another word: ""gulpy"" -> G,U,L,P,Y -> but O must be in second position? So ""gulpy"" is G,U,L,P,Y -> O not at position 2? So not.

        We need O at position 2.

        Another: ""folky"" -> F,O,L,K,Y -> K is allowed? Yes. But L is allowed? Yes. F,O,L,K,Y -> but we don't know about F,K,Y? So ""folky"": F,O,L,K,Y -> positions: 1:F,2:O,3:L,4:K,5:Y -> but we haven't tried F,L,K,Y? Yes.

        However, we must check: we haven't excluded F,L,K,Y? Correct.

        So options: 
          - ""would"", ""dough"", ""howdy"", ""folky"", ""jowly"", ""boxdy"" (not a word).

        Now, we want to test common letters? 
        Common letters remaining: L, D, U, G, H, P, B, etc.

        Actually, after excluding C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T, the next most common letters in English are: O (already known), then D, L, U, G, H, B, P.

        Therefore, we might choose a word that includes D, L, or U? And avoid rare letters like J, Z, etc.

        Let's prioritize:

          ""would"": uses W (uncommon), U, L (common), D (common) -> common: U,L,D.
          ""dough"": uses D (common), U (vowel), G (common), H (common) -> common: D,U,G,H.
          ""howdy"": H (common), W (uncommon), D (common), Y (common? but not as much) -> common: H,D,Y? But we are testing Y which is less common.

        Therefore, ""dough"" seems to cover more common letters: D,U,G,H -> all common.

        However, note: we are guessing ""dough"": 
            D at position 1 -> is D in the word?
            O at position 2 -> known correct.
            U at position 3 -> is U in the word?
            G at position 4 -> is G in the word?
            H at position 5 -> is H in the word?

        Alternatively, ""dough"" uses all new letters and covers D,U,G,H which are common and not yet tested.

        There's another word: ""bough"": B,O,U,G,H -> same as dough but with B? B is allowed? Yes. And common? Less common than D? B and D are both common. But we might test more common letters? Actually D is more common? In terms of frequency: D is about 4.25% or less? But in any case, we want to test a variety.

        But ""dough"" is fine.

        Another word: ""pound"" -> but N excluded? No, ""pound"" has N -> excluded -> invalid.

        So I think ""dough"" is a valid and good candidate.

        However, we have the option ""foggy"": F,O,G,G,Y -> but duplicate G? We avoid duplicates? Unless necessary? Also, Y might be less common? So ""dough"" is better because no duplication.

        Let's choose ""dough"".

        So our guess: dough

        Format: <guess>dough</guess>

        But wait, is there a reason to choose ""would"" over ""dough""? 

        ""would"" would test U and L and D and W? But W is less common? And U is a vowel we haven't tested.

        Given that we have no information on vowels? We have excluded A, E, I -> so the remaining vowels are O and U? And we know O is in the word. There might be another vowel? Typically, words have at least two vowels? So U is a good candidate? So both ""dough"" and ""would"" test U? 

        Actually, ""dough"" and ""would"" both test U? 
          - ""dough"": has U at position 3: so we test U at position 3.
          - ""would"": has U at position 3: also.

        So they both test U? Then ""dough"" tests additionally G and H? And ""would"" tests L? 

        Since L is common, we might want to test it? 

        But we can decide arbitrarily? 

        Actually, we can also consider ""gouhy""? Not a word.

        Final choice: ""dough"" because it tests 4 consonants? Or we can try ""lurky""? Not valid.

        Alternatively, what about ""dougy""? Not valid.

        We'll go with ""dough"".

        So the guess: doughBased on the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): Letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""moist""): 
  - M, I, S, T are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
  - O is correct and in the right position (marked ""✓"") → **The second letter is O**.

**Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, T  
**Known information**:  
- The secret word has 5 letters.  
- Second letter is O → Format: _ O _ _ _  

For the next guess:
- Must avoid excluded letters.  
- Focus on common unused letters (remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
- Prioritize testing vowels (like U) and frequent consonants (like D, G, H, L).  

A good candidate is **""dough""** because:  
- Second letter is O (required).  
- Tests new common letters: D, U, G, H (all untried).  
- Valid 5-letter word.  

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities by testing four new letters while leveraging the known ""O"" position.",Guess 3: dough -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. This covers 5 common letters and includes two vowels (A and E).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: 
 The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have excluded 5: C, R, A, N, E.

 Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
 Remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are excluded)

 We should try to cover as many common letters as possible. Common letters in English include S, T, L, O, etc.

 Since we have no information, we want a word that uses common letters from the remaining set.

 Some common letters from the remaining set: S, T, L, O, I, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

 We can try a word that has a mix of vowels and consonants. For example, using O and I as vowels.

 Possible words: 
   - ""TOILS"" -> but we don't know if S is available? Actually, we haven't ruled out S. However, we must avoid the excluded letters.

 Let's list words without C, R, A, N, E.

 Some options:
   - ""GHOUL"" -> 5 letters? No, that's 5: G, H, O, U, L -> but we have 5 letters? Actually, ""ghoul"" is 5 letters.
   - ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S -> 5 letters.

 However, we might want to use more common letters. Let's try:

   - ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H -> all are allowed? Yes, because none of these are in {C, R, A, N, E}.
   - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> also allowed.

 But note: we want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters. The most common consonants left are S, T, L, and then M, P, etc. and vowels O, I.

 Another good candidate: ""OUIJA"" is not common and has J which is less common.

 Alternatively, ""PILOT"" -> P, I, L, O, T -> but L and T are common.

 However, we must ensure the word is valid.

 Let me choose ""MOIST"" because it uses M, O, I, S, T which are common and we haven't tried.

 But note: we are avoiding E and A, so we have to use O, I, U. ""MOIST"" uses O and I.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"" -> S, H, O, U, T -> also valid.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it covers two vowels (O, I) and three common consonants (M, S, T).

 However, we have to be cautious: we don't know if the word has duplicates? But the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates so far, but the secret word might have duplicates. But we are not using any duplicate in our guess.

 Let's go with ""MOIST"".

 But wait, what about ""BUILD""? B, U, I, L, D -> but we don't have B, D, L in the excluded set. However, we haven't tried B or D. But we want to cover more common letters? S and T are more common than B and D.

 Another option: ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> but Y is sometimes a vowel, and we have O and U.

 However, I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.

 Alternatively, ""HOIST"" is similar to ""MOIST"" but with H instead of M. H is less common than M? Actually, both are common.

 But we are going for maximum coverage. Since we have no information, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 We are going to use ""MOIST"".

 So, the next guess: ""moist""

 Format: <guess>moist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (all letters marked as ""x""), I know that the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For my next guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely to test new common letters. 

I'll prioritize frequent consonants like S, T, L, M, and vowels like O, I, U. A good candidate is **""moist""** because:
- It uses 5 new, common letters (M, O, I, S, T).
- It covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants.
- It avoids the excluded letters from the first guess.

This guess maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback by testing high-frequency letters not yet attempted.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. Guess: crane -> All letters (C,R,A,N,E) are not in the secret word. So we exclude C,R,A,N,E.
2. Guess: moist -> Feedback: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
   This tells us:
      - O is in the word and in the correct position (since it got a checkmark). Specifically, O is the second letter because in ""moist"", O is at position 2 (positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T).
   Therefore, the second letter of the secret word is O.
   Also, M, I, S, T are not in the word. So we can exclude M, I, S, T.

Now, we know:
   Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T
   Required: The second letter is O.

We need to guess a 5-letter word that:
   - Has O as the second letter.
   - Contains none of the excluded letters (C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T).
   - Uses other letters from the English alphabet.

Remaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We also note that we have not used many common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are O (but we already know the position) and U (and sometimes Y). But O is already placed, so we need to use other vowels? Actually, we don't know if there are other vowels in the word. The remaining vowels available: U, and Y (if considered vowel) or sometimes consonants? But we'll treat Y as a possible vowel.

We need to form a word in the form: _ O _ _ _ 

Possible letters for the other positions: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible to gather information.

Common remaining consonants: H, L, D, P, G, B, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (and Y).

Let's think of words that have O as the second letter and are composed of the remaining letters.

Some candidates:
   - G O L D ... but ""gold"" is only 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So we need 5-letter words.
   - Possible words: 
        * ""fouls"" -> but S is excluded? Wait, S is excluded from guess 2 (S was marked x). So we can't use S.
        * ""gouge"" -> E is excluded? E is excluded from guess 1 (E was marked x). So no.
        * ""pound"" -> P,O,U,N,D -> but N is excluded? In guess1, N was marked x -> excluded. So no N.
        * ""bough"": B,O,U,G,H -> letters: B,O,U,G,H. 
            - Check excluded: B, O (we know O is in, but we can use O again? Actually, the feedback for O was correct, but we don't know if there are multiple O's. The feedback only told us about one O. The feedback format does not explicitly show duplicates. However, if we use O again, we might get a '-' or 'x'. But note: we don't have any information about duplicate O's. However, in ""moist"", O was correct and the rest were not. So if the word had another O, it would have been marked by either '-' in another position or ✓ if in that same position? But we didn't have any other O. So we cannot rule out another O? But the word might contain O only once.

        However, we must avoid excluded letters: B is not excluded? We haven't tried B. So ""bough"" seems okay? 
        But we need to check the letters: 
            B: not excluded
            O: we know it's in the word, but we are placing it again? Actually, we are forced to put O in the second position. The word must have O in the second position. So we cannot put O in another position? Actually, we can, but we should avoid repeating letters if we aren't sure? Since we don't know if there is a duplicate, we can use letters we haven't tried.

        But let's look for words without duplicates unless necessary.

   - ""hobby"": H,O,B,B,Y -> duplicates B and Y. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Yes, but we don't know. However, we haven't tried H, B, Y so we might test new letters.

   - Better words:

        ""tough"" -> but T is excluded? In guess2, T was marked x -> excluded. So we cannot use T.

        ""could"" -> C and U and L and D: but C is excluded -> no.

        ""would"" -> W,O,U,L,D: W is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tried W. U and L and D are allowed? Yes. So ""would"" -> letters: W,O,U,L,D -> all except O are new.

        But we have excluded A,C,E,I,M,N,R,S,T -> so yes.

        ""would"": 
            Position: W (1), O (2), U (3), L (4), D (5)
            This uses new letters: W, U, L, D.

        Another word: ""joule"" -> J,O,U,L,E -> E is excluded? E was x in guess1 -> excluded. So not allowed.

        ""vouch"" -> V,O,U,C,H -> C is excluded? Yes -> no.

        ""pound"": P,O,U,N,D -> N is excluded? In guess1 N was x -> excluded. So no.

        ""boozy"": B,O,O,Z,Y -> has two O's? And Z and Y? 
            B, O, Z, Y -> all are allowed? We don't have any exclusion for these. So ""boozy"" is a word? Meaning: affected by alcohol, and it's 5 letters? Yes.

        But we don't know if the word has an O? But we are placing O in the second position. If there is another O, it might get a dash or an x? But we are primarily testing new letters.

        However, we might avoid duplicates because we don't know? Also, duplicate letters might complicate.

        Let's consider:

        ""boogy"" -> not a valid word? Actually, ""boggy"" has two G's -> but G is allowed? ""boggy"": B,O,G,G,Y -> but we haven't tried B,G,Y? Yes. And O is at position 2. But ""boggy"" is not a word? Valid word: ""bogey"" has E? E is excluded. Or ""boggy"" is valid? It means marshy. Yes.

        However, spelling: ""boggy"" -> 5 letters: B,O,G,G,Y. Second letter O.

        But we have two G's? We don't know how the feedback will handle duplicates? The secret word might have one G and then we might get one G marked and the other incorrect? It's tricky.

        We want to maximize new letters? So let's prefer a word without duplicates.

        Another word: ""dough"": D,O,U,G,H -> D,O,U,G,H -> all letters allowed? Yes. And all letters are new? Yes: D,O (we know O but we are testing new letters otherwise).

        ""dough"" is a valid word.

        ""booth"": B,O,O,T,H -> T is excluded from guess2? Yes, T was marked x -> excluded. So we cannot use T.

        ""brook"": B,R,... R is excluded -> no.

        Good options:
          - ""dough"": D,O,U,G,H -> letters D,U,G,H are new.
          - ""fouls"": F,O,U,L,S -> but S is excluded? Guess2: S was marked x -> excluded. So cannot use S.

        ""gouge"": G,O,U,G,E -> E excluded? Yes -> no.

        ""proud"": P,R,... R excluded -> no.

        ""wound"": W,O,U,N,D -> N excluded? Yes -> no.

        ""louse"": L,O,U,S,E -> S and E excluded -> no.

        ""boule"": B,O,U,L,E -> E excluded -> no.

        ""bound"": B,O,U,N,D -> N excluded -> no.

        ""hound"": H,O,U,N,D -> N excluded -> no.

        ""would"": W,O,U,L,D -> no excluded letters? We have W,O,U,L,D -> O is allowed, and W,U,L,D not excluded? Correct.

        ""would"": 
            W: not excluded? 
            U: not excluded? 
            L: not excluded? 
            D: not excluded?

        So yes.

        Another: ""could"" -> C excluded -> no.

        How about ""gowdy""? Not common. Or ""jowly"": J,O,W,L,Y -> valid word? Meaning: having prominent jowls. So letters J,O,W,L,Y -> all allowed? Yes.

        But J and Y are less common? We might avoid them? Or test? Since we need to cover letters.

        Alternatively, ""bowly"" is not a word.

        ""howdy"": H,O,W,D,Y -> valid. So ""howdy"" -> H,O,W,D,Y.

        Comparing ""would"", ""dough"", ""howdy"", and ""jowly"".

        We already have ""dough"" which uses D,U,G,H -> G and H are common? Yes.

        So let's list the words we can use:
          - ""would"": tests W,U,L,D -> positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:U, 4:L, 5:D
          - ""dough"": tests D,U,G,H -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:G, 5:H
          - ""howdy"": tests H,O,W,D,Y -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:W, 4:D, 5:Y
          - ""jowly"": tests J,O,W,L,Y -> positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:W, 4:L, 5:Y

        Since we don't have any information on vowels? We haven't tried U? So we might want to test U? So ""would"" or ""dough"" or ""howdy"" have U or Y? ""howdy"" has Y.

        It's a trade-off: 
          - ""dough"": covers D,U,G,H -> 4 new letters? Actually 5: D,O,U,G,H -> O we know is there, but we are testing the others.
          - ""would"": covers W,U,L,D -> also 4 new letters (if we don't count O) -> but we are testing W,U,L,D.
          - ""howdy"": tests H,O,W,D,Y -> H,W,D,Y -> 4 new letters? O is known. But we haven't tried H,W,D,Y.

        But note: we have only excluded C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T -> so 9 letters. We have many left.

        Another word: ""gulpy"" -> G,U,L,P,Y -> but O must be in second position? So ""gulpy"" is G,U,L,P,Y -> O not at position 2? So not.

        We need O at position 2.

        Another: ""folky"" -> F,O,L,K,Y -> K is allowed? Yes. But L is allowed? Yes. F,O,L,K,Y -> but we don't know about F,K,Y? So ""folky"": F,O,L,K,Y -> positions: 1:F,2:O,3:L,4:K,5:Y -> but we haven't tried F,L,K,Y? Yes.

        However, we must check: we haven't excluded F,L,K,Y? Correct.

        So options: 
          - ""would"", ""dough"", ""howdy"", ""folky"", ""jowly"", ""boxdy"" (not a word).

        Now, we want to test common letters? 
        Common letters remaining: L, D, U, G, H, P, B, etc.

        Actually, after excluding C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T, the next most common letters in English are: O (already known), then D, L, U, G, H, B, P.

        Therefore, we might choose a word that includes D, L, or U? And avoid rare letters like J, Z, etc.

        Let's prioritize:

          ""would"": uses W (uncommon), U, L (common), D (common) -> common: U,L,D.
          ""dough"": uses D (common), U (vowel), G (common), H (common) -> common: D,U,G,H.
          ""howdy"": H (common), W (uncommon), D (common), Y (common? but not as much) -> common: H,D,Y? But we are testing Y which is less common.

        Therefore, ""dough"" seems to cover more common letters: D,U,G,H -> all common.

        However, note: we are guessing ""dough"": 
            D at position 1 -> is D in the word?
            O at position 2 -> known correct.
            U at position 3 -> is U in the word?
            G at position 4 -> is G in the word?
            H at position 5 -> is H in the word?

        Alternatively, ""dough"" uses all new letters and covers D,U,G,H which are common and not yet tested.

        There's another word: ""bough"": B,O,U,G,H -> same as dough but with B? B is allowed? Yes. And common? Less common than D? B and D are both common. But we might test more common letters? Actually D is more common? In terms of frequency: D is about 4.25% or less? But in any case, we want to test a variety.

        But ""dough"" is fine.

        Another word: ""pound"" -> but N excluded? No, ""pound"" has N -> excluded -> invalid.

        So I think ""dough"" is a valid and good candidate.

        However, we have the option ""foggy"": F,O,G,G,Y -> but duplicate G? We avoid duplicates? Unless necessary? Also, Y might be less common? So ""dough"" is better because no duplication.

        Let's choose ""dough"".

        So our guess: dough

        Format: <guess>dough</guess>

        But wait, is there a reason to choose ""would"" over ""dough""? 

        ""would"" would test U and L and D and W? But W is less common? And U is a vowel we haven't tested.

        Given that we have no information on vowels? We have excluded A, E, I -> so the remaining vowels are O and U? And we know O is in the word. There might be another vowel? Typically, words have at least two vowels? So U is a good candidate? So both ""dough"" and ""would"" test U? 

        Actually, ""dough"" and ""would"" both test U? 
          - ""dough"": has U at position 3: so we test U at position 3.
          - ""would"": has U at position 3: also.

        So they both test U? Then ""dough"" tests additionally G and H? And ""would"" tests L? 

        Since L is common, we might want to test it? 

        But we can decide arbitrarily? 

        Actually, we can also consider ""gouhy""? Not a word.

        Final choice: ""dough"" because it tests 4 consonants? Or we can try ""lurky""? Not valid.

        Alternatively, what about ""dougy""? Not valid.

        We'll go with ""dough"".

        So the guess: doughBased on the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): Letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""moist""): 
  - M, I, S, T are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
  - O is correct and in the right position (marked ""✓"") → **The second letter is O**.

**Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, T  
**Known information**:  
- The secret word has 5 letters.  
- Second letter is O → Format: _ O _ _ _  

For the next guess:
- Must avoid excluded letters.  
- Focus on common unused letters (remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
- Prioritize testing vowels (like U) and frequent consonants (like D, G, H, L).  

A good candidate is **""dough""** because:  
- Second letter is O (required).  
- Tests new common letters: D, U, G, H (all untried).  
- Valid 5-letter word.  

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities by testing four new letters while leveraging the known ""O"" position.

Actually, the feedback for O was correct, but we don\'t know if there are multiple O\'s. The feedback only told us about one O. The feedback format does not explicitly show duplicates. However, if we use O again, we might get a \'-\' or \'x\'. But note: we don\'t have any information about duplicate O\'s. However, in ""moist"", O was correct and the rest were not.

Actually, we are forced to put O in the second position. The word must have O in the second position. So we cannot put O in another position? Actually, we can, but we should avoid repeating letters if we aren\'t sure? Since we don\'t know if there is a duplicate, we can use letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n        But let\'s look for words without duplicates unless necessary.\n\n   - ""hobby"": H,O,B,B,Y -> duplicates B and Y.

Meaning: affected by alcohol, and it\'s 5 letters? Yes.\n\n        But we don\'t know if the word has an O? But we are placing O in the second position. If there is another O, it might get a dash or an x? But we are primarily testing new letters.\n\n        However, we might avoid duplicates because we don\'t know? Also, duplicate letters might complicate.\n\n        Let\'s consider:\n\n        ""boogy"" -> not a valid word? Actually, ""boggy"" has two G\'s -> but G is allowed? ""boggy"": B,O,G,G,Y -> but we haven\'t tried B,G,Y? Yes. And O is at position 2. But ""boggy"" is not a word? Valid word: ""bogey"" has E? E is excluded. Or ""boggy"" is valid? It means marshy. Yes.\n\n        However, spelling: ""boggy"" -> 5 letters: B,O,G,G,Y. Second letter O.\n\n        But we have two G\'s? We don\'t know how the feedback will handle duplicates? The secret word might have one G and then we might get one G marked and the other incorrect? It\'s tricky.\n\n        We want to maximize new letters? So let\'s prefer a word without duplicates.\n\n        Another word: ""dough"": D,O,U,G,H -> D,O,U,G,H -> all letters allowed? Yes. And all letters are new? Yes: D,O (we know O but we are testing new letters otherwise).\n\n        ""dough"" is a valid word.\n\n        ""booth"": B,O,O,T,H -> T is excluded from guess2? Yes, T was marked x -> excluded.

R is excluded -> no.\n\n        Good options:\n          - ""dough"": D,O,U,G,H -> letters D,U,G,H are new.\n          - ""fouls"": F,O,U,L,S -> but S is excluded? Guess2: S was marked x -> excluded. So cannot use S.\n\n        ""gouge"": G,O,U,G,E -> E excluded? Yes -> no.\n\n        ""proud"": P,R,... R excluded -> no.\n\n        ""wound"": W,O,U,N,D -> N excluded? Yes -> no.\n\n        ""louse"": L,O,U,S,E -> S and E excluded -> no.\n\n        ""boule"": B,O,U,L,E -> E excluded -> no.\n\n        ""bound"": B,O,U,N,D -> N excluded -> no.\n\n        ""hound"": H,O,U,N,D -> N excluded -> no.\n\n        ""would"": W,O,U,L,D -> no excluded letters?

Correct.\n\n        ""would"": \n            W: not excluded? \n            U: not excluded? \n            L: not excluded? \n            D: not excluded?\n\n        So yes.\n\n        Another: ""could"" -> C excluded -> no.\n\n        How about ""gowdy""? Not common. Or ""jowly"": J,O,W,L,Y -> valid word? Meaning: having prominent jowls. So letters J,O,W,L,Y -> all allowed? Yes.\n\n        But J and Y are less common? We might avoid them? Or test? Since we need to cover letters.\n\n        Alternatively, ""bowly"" is not a word.\n\n        ""howdy"": H,O,W,D,Y -> valid. So ""howdy"" -> H,O,W,D,Y.\n\n        Comparing ""would"", ""dough"", ""howdy"", and ""jowly"".\n\n        We already have ""dough"" which uses D,U,G,H -> G and H are common? Yes.\n\n        So let\'s list the words we can use:\n          - ""would"": tests W,U,L,D -> positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:U, 4:L, 5:D\n          - ""dough"": tests D,U,G,H -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:G, 5:H\n          - ""howdy"": tests H,O,W,D,Y -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:W, 4:D, 5:Y\n          - ""jowly"": tests J,O,W,L,Y -> positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:W, 4:L, 5:Y\n\n        Since we don\'t have any information on vowels? We haven\'t tried U? So we might want to test U? So ""would"" or ""dough"" or ""howdy"" have U or Y? ""howdy"" has Y.\n\n        It\'s a trade-off: \n          - ""dough"": covers D,U,G,H -> 4 new letters? Actually 5: D,O,U,G,H -> O we know is there, but we are testing the others.\n          - ""would"": covers W,U,L,D -> also 4 new letters (if we don\'t count O) -> but we are testing W,U,L,D.\n          - ""howdy"": tests H,O,W,D,Y -> H,W,D,Y -> 4 new letters? O is known. But we haven\'t tried H,W,D,Y.\n\n        But note: we have only excluded C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T -> so 9 letters. We have many left.\n\n        Another word: ""gulpy"" -> G,U,L,P,Y -> but O must be in second position? So ""gulpy"" is G,U,L,P,Y -> O not at position 2? So not.\n\n        We need O at position 2.\n\n        Another: ""folky"" -> F,O,L,K,Y -> K is allowed? Yes. But L is allowed? Yes. F,O,L,K,Y -> but we don\'t know about F,K,Y? So ""folky"": F,O,L,K,Y -> positions: 1:F,2:O,3:L,4:K,5:Y -> but we haven\'t tried F,L,K,Y? Yes.\n\n        However, we must check: we haven\'t excluded F,L,K,Y? Correct.\n\n        So options: \n          - ""would"", ""dough"", ""howdy"", ""folky"", ""jowly"", ""boxdy"" (not a word).\n\n        Now, we want to test common letters? \n        Common letters remaining: L, D, U, G, H, P, B, etc.\n\n        Actually, after excluding C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T, the next most common letters in English are: O (already known), then D, L, U, G, H, B, P.\n\n        Therefore, we might choose a word that includes D, L, or U? And avoid rare letters like J, Z, etc.\n\n        Let\'s prioritize:\n\n          ""would"": uses W (uncommon), U, L (common), D (common) -> common: U,L,D.\n          ""dough"": uses D (common), U (vowel), G (common), H (common) -> common: D,U,G,H.\n          ""howdy"": H (common), W (uncommon), D (common), Y (common? but not as much) -> common: H,D,Y? But we are testing Y which is less common.\n\n        Therefore, ""dough"" seems to cover more common letters: D,U,G,H -> all common.\n\n        However, note: we are guessing ""dough"": \n            D at position 1 -> is D in the word?\n            O at position 2 -> known correct.\n            U at position 3 -> is U in the word?\n            G at position 4 -> is G in the word?\n            H at position 5 -> is H in the word?\n\n        Alternatively, ""dough"" uses all new letters and covers D,U,G,H which are common and not yet tested.\n\n        There\'s another word: ""bough"": B,O,U,G,H -> same as dough but with B? B is allowed? Yes. And common? Less common than D? B and D are both common. But we might test more common letters? Actually D is more common? In terms of frequency: D is about 4.25% or less? But in any case, we want to test a variety.\n\n        But ""dough"" is fine.\n\n        Another word: ""pound"" -> but N excluded? No, ""pound"" has N -> excluded -> invalid.\n\n        So I think ""dough"" is a valid and good candidate.\n\n        However, we have the option ""foggy"": F,O,G,G,Y -> but duplicate G? We avoid duplicates? Unless necessary? Also, Y might be less common? So ""dough"" is better because no duplication.\n\n        Let\'s choose ""dough"".\n\n        So our guess: dough\n\n        Format: <guess>dough</guess>\n\n        But wait, is there a reason to choose ""would"" over ""dough""? \n\n        ""would"" would test U and L and D and W? But W is less common? And U is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\n        Given that we have no information on vowels? We have excluded A, E, I -> so the remaining vowels are O and U? And we know O is in the word. There might be another vowel? Typically, words have at least two vowels? So U is a good candidate? So both ""dough"" and ""would"" test U? \n\n        Actually, ""dough"" and ""would"" both test U? \n          - ""dough"": has U at position 3: so we test U at position 3.\n          - ""would"": has U at position 3: also.\n\n        So they both test U? Then ""dough"" tests additionally G and H? And ""would"" tests L? \n\n        Since L is common, we might want to test it? \n\n        But we can decide arbitrarily? \n\n        Actually, we can also consider ""gouhy""? Not a word.\n\n        Final choice: ""dough"" because it tests 4 consonants? Or we can try ""lurky""? Not valid.\n\n        Alternatively, what about ""dougy""?

We are given feedback for three guesses:
1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the secret word -> excluded.
2. ""moist"": M, I, S, T are not in the word, and O is in the correct position (second letter) -> so we know the second letter is O.
3. ""dough"": D, U, G, H are not in the word, and O is again confirmed in the correct position (second letter) -> so we exclude D, U, G, H.

Now, we know:
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, T, D, U, G, H
- The secret word has the second letter O: _ O _ _ _

Remaining letters: B, F, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a 5-letter word that has O in the second position and uses only the remaining letters.

Let's list possible words:

We have very few letters left. The remaining letters are not very common, so we might have to use some of them.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ O _ _ _ and use only the allowed letters:

- ""jolly"": J, O, L, L, Y -> but we have two L's? And we haven't excluded L or Y? 
  - Positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? We haven't encountered any duplicate feedback so far? But we can try.

  However, we must check if ""jolly"" is valid? Yes, meaning cheerful.

- ""folly"": F, O, L, L, Y -> but F is allowed? Yes, and L, Y. But we have two L's? 
  - But note: F is not excluded? We haven't tried F. So ""folly"" is a candidate.

- ""polyp"": P, O, L, Y, P -> has two P's? And Y. Letters: P, O, L, Y, P -> but we haven't excluded P, L, Y? So valid? But ""polyp"" is a word? Yes, a type of growth.

- ""boxed"": B, O, X, E, D -> but E and D are excluded? E from guess1 and D from guess3 -> so not allowed.

- ""boxer"": B, O, X, E, R -> E and R excluded -> no.

- ""joked"": J, O, K, E, D -> E and D excluded -> no.

- ""lobby"": L, O, B, B, Y -> has two B's? And we haven't excluded L, B, Y? So ""lobby"" is a candidate? But note: the pattern is _ O _ _ _ -> so first letter L, second O, then B, B, Y? That would be L O B B Y -> 5 letters? Yes.

- ""poker"": P, O, K, E, R -> E and R excluded -> no.

- ""voter"": V, O, T, E, R -> T, E, R excluded -> no.

- ""woken"": W, O, K, E, N -> E and N excluded -> no.

- ""yolky"": Y, O, L, K, Y -> has two Y's? And we haven't excluded Y, L, K? So ""yolky"" is a candidate? Meaning: having a yolk. But note: first letter Y, second O, then L, K, Y.

- ""polka"": P, O, L, K, A -> A is excluded? From guess1 -> yes, A is excluded -> no.

- ""volva"": V, O, L, V, A -> A excluded and V repeated? Also, A excluded -> no.

- ""jowly"": J, O, W, L, Y -> we haven't excluded J, W, L, Y? So ""jowly"" is a candidate? But we tried ""jowly"" in the previous step? Actually, we didn't use it. And it has no duplicates? J, O, W, L, Y -> all distinct? Yes.

- ""howdy"": H is excluded? From guess3 -> H was marked x -> excluded. So no.

- ""lowly"": L, O, W, L, Y -> has two L's? And W, Y. But H is excluded? ""lowly"" doesn't have H? It has L,O,W,L,Y -> so letters: L, O, W, Y. But we have two L's? And we haven't excluded L, W, Y? So ""lowly"" is a candidate.

Now, we have several candidates: 
  - ""jolly"" (J,O,L,L,Y)
  - ""folly"" (F,O,L,L,Y)
  - ""polyp"" (P,O,L,Y,P) -> two P's
  - ""lobby"" (L,O,B,B,Y) -> two B's
  - ""yolky"" (Y,O,L,K,Y) -> two Y's
  - ""jowly"" (J,O,W,L,Y) -> all distinct
  - ""lowly"" (L,O,W,L,Y) -> two L's

We want to choose a word that maximizes the chance of getting information? Since we have many possibilities, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible without duplicates? But duplicates might be present? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses distinct letters to test more letters? So ""jowly"" has distinct letters? J, O, W, L, Y -> but O is already known, so we are testing J, W, L, Y? That's 4 new letters? And no duplicates.

Similarly, ""jolly"" has two L's? So we are testing J, L, Y? But L appears twice? So if L is in the word, we might get feedback on one or both? But it's less efficient? 

So we prefer words without duplicates? 

Therefore, ""jowly"" is a good candidate? It tests J, W, L, Y? And we know O is in the second position.

Another candidate without duplicates: ""jowly"" is one. 

What about ""boxed""? But E and D excluded? No.

""puffy""? P,U,F,F,Y -> U excluded? From guess3 -> U was marked x -> excluded. So no.

""kooky"": K,O,O,K,Y -> two O's? But we know O is in the word? But we are putting O in the second position? And then another O? But we don't know if there is a duplicate O? Also, K and Y? But we haven't excluded K? So ""kooky"" is a candidate? But it has two O's and two K's? So duplicates.

""jowly"" seems the best? 

But let's check if there is a word with more common letters? The remaining letters are not very common? But we have to use them.

Another word: ""vozhd""? Not English? 

""woozy"": W,O,O,Z,Y -> two O's? And Z? But we haven't excluded W, Z, Y? So ""woozy"" is a candidate? But it has two O's? And we are testing W, Z, Y? But we don't know if the word has another O? 

But we are trying to avoid duplicates? So ""jowly"" is better? 

Alternatively, ""polly"": P,O,L,L,Y -> two L's? And we haven't excluded P, L, Y? So ""polly"" is a candidate? But duplicate L.

I think ""jowly"" is a good choice because it has no duplicates and tests 4 new letters: J, W, L, Y.

So we'll go with ""jowly"".

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid? ""jowly"" is a valid English word? Yes, meaning having heavy or sagging cheeks.

So guess: jowly

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → Excluded.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**: 
  - O is correct and in position 2 (✓).  
  - M, I, S, T are absent (x) → Excluded.
- **Guess 3 (dough)**:
  - O is confirmed in position 2 (✓).  
  - D, U, G, H are absent (x) → Excluded.  

**Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, T, D, U, G, H  
**Known Position**:  
- The second letter is **O** → Secret word format: `_ O _ _ _`  

**Remaining Letters**: B, F, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The secret word must have **O** in position 2 and use only the remaining letters.  
- Prioritize words with **distinct new letters** to maximize information (avoid duplicates).  
- Test high-frequency remaining consonants (L, P, B, Y) and vowels (Y) where possible.  
- **""jowly""** fits perfectly:  
  - `J` (position 1), `O` (position 2, confirmed), `W` (position 3), `L` (position 4), `Y` (position 5).  
  - Uses 4 new letters (J, W, L, Y), all distinct and untested.  
  - Valid 5-letter word (meaning: having prominent jowls).  

This guess efficiently tests critical letters while respecting the known constraints.

 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. This covers 5 common letters and includes two vowels (A and E).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: 
 The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have excluded 5: C, R, A, N, E.

 Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
 Remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are excluded)

 We should try to cover as many common letters as possible. Common letters in English include S, T, L, O, etc.

 Since we have no information, we want a word that uses common letters from the remaining set.

 Some common letters from the remaining set: S, T, L, O, I, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

 We can try a word that has a mix of vowels and consonants. For example, using O and I as vowels.

 Possible words: 
   - ""TOILS"" -> but we don't know if S is available? Actually, we haven't ruled out S. However, we must avoid the excluded letters.

 Let's list words without C, R, A, N, E.

 Some options:
   - ""GHOUL"" -> 5 letters? No, that's 5: G, H, O, U, L -> but we have 5 letters? Actually, ""ghoul"" is 5 letters.
   - ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S -> 5 letters.

 However, we might want to use more common letters. Let's try:

   - ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H -> all are allowed? Yes, because none of these are in {C, R, A, N, E}.
   - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> also allowed.

 But note: we want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters. The most common consonants left are S, T, L, and then M, P, etc. and vowels O, I.

 Another good candidate: ""OUIJA"" is not common and has J which is less common.

 Alternatively, ""PILOT"" -> P, I, L, O, T -> but L and T are common.

 However, we must ensure the word is valid.

 Let me choose ""MOIST"" because it uses M, O, I, S, T which are common and we haven't tried.

 But note: we are avoiding E and A, so we have to use O, I, U. ""MOIST"" uses O and I.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"" -> S, H, O, U, T -> also valid.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it covers two vowels (O, I) and three common consonants (M, S, T).

 However, we have to be cautious: we don't know if the word has duplicates? But the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates so far, but the secret word might have duplicates. But we are not using any duplicate in our guess.

 Let's go with ""MOIST"".

 But wait, what about ""BUILD""? B, U, I, L, D -> but we don't have B, D, L in the excluded set. However, we haven't tried B or D. But we want to cover more common letters? S and T are more common than B and D.

 Another option: ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> but Y is sometimes a vowel, and we have O and U.

 However, I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.

 Alternatively, ""HOIST"" is similar to ""MOIST"" but with H instead of M. H is less common than M? Actually, both are common.

 But we are going for maximum coverage. Since we have no information, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 We are going to use ""MOIST"".

 So, the next guess: ""moist""

 Format: <guess>moist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (all letters marked as ""x""), I know that the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For my next guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely to test new common letters. 

I'll prioritize frequent consonants like S, T, L, M, and vowels like O, I, U. A good candidate is **""moist""** because:
- It uses 5 new, common letters (M, O, I, S, T).
- It covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants.
- It avoids the excluded letters from the first guess.

This guess maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback by testing high-frequency letters not yet attempted.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. Guess: crane -> All letters (C,R,A,N,E) are not in the secret word. So we exclude C,R,A,N,E.
2. Guess: moist -> Feedback: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
   This tells us:
      - O is in the word and in the correct position (since it got a checkmark). Specifically, O is the second letter because in ""moist"", O is at position 2 (positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T).
   Therefore, the second letter of the secret word is O.
   Also, M, I, S, T are not in the word. So we can exclude M, I, S, T.

Now, we know:
   Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T
   Required: The second letter is O.

We need to guess a 5-letter word that:
   - Has O as the second letter.
   - Contains none of the excluded letters (C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T).
   - Uses other letters from the English alphabet.

Remaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We also note that we have not used many common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are O (but we already know the position) and U (and sometimes Y). But O is already placed, so we need to use other vowels? Actually, we don't know if there are other vowels in the word. The remaining vowels available: U, and Y (if considered vowel) or sometimes consonants? But we'll treat Y as a possible vowel.

We need to form a word in the form: _ O _ _ _ 

Possible letters for the other positions: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible to gather information.

Common remaining consonants: H, L, D, P, G, B, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (and Y).

Let's think of words that have O as the second letter and are composed of the remaining letters.

Some candidates:
   - G O L D ... but ""gold"" is only 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So we need 5-letter words.
   - Possible words: 
        * ""fouls"" -> but S is excluded? Wait, S is excluded from guess 2 (S was marked x). So we can't use S.
        * ""gouge"" -> E is excluded? E is excluded from guess 1 (E was marked x). So no.
        * ""pound"" -> P,O,U,N,D -> but N is excluded? In guess1, N was marked x -> excluded. So no N.
        * ""bough"": B,O,U,G,H -> letters: B,O,U,G,H. 
            - Check excluded: B, O (we know O is in, but we can use O again? Actually, the feedback for O was correct, but we don't know if there are multiple O's. The feedback only told us about one O. The feedback format does not explicitly show duplicates. However, if we use O again, we might get a '-' or 'x'. But note: we don't have any information about duplicate O's. However, in ""moist"", O was correct and the rest were not. So if the word had another O, it would have been marked by either '-' in another position or ✓ if in that same position? But we didn't have any other O. So we cannot rule out another O? But the word might contain O only once.

        However, we must avoid excluded letters: B is not excluded? We haven't tried B. So ""bough"" seems okay? 
        But we need to check the letters: 
            B: not excluded
            O: we know it's in the word, but we are placing it again? Actually, we are forced to put O in the second position. The word must have O in the second position. So we cannot put O in another position? Actually, we can, but we should avoid repeating letters if we aren't sure? Since we don't know if there is a duplicate, we can use letters we haven't tried.

        But let's look for words without duplicates unless necessary.

   - ""hobby"": H,O,B,B,Y -> duplicates B and Y. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Yes, but we don't know. However, we haven't tried H, B, Y so we might test new letters.

   - Better words:

        ""tough"" -> but T is excluded? In guess2, T was marked x -> excluded. So we cannot use T.

        ""could"" -> C and U and L and D: but C is excluded -> no.

        ""would"" -> W,O,U,L,D: W is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tried W. U and L and D are allowed? Yes. So ""would"" -> letters: W,O,U,L,D -> all except O are new.

        But we have excluded A,C,E,I,M,N,R,S,T -> so yes.

        ""would"": 
            Position: W (1), O (2), U (3), L (4), D (5)
            This uses new letters: W, U, L, D.

        Another word: ""joule"" -> J,O,U,L,E -> E is excluded? E was x in guess1 -> excluded. So not allowed.

        ""vouch"" -> V,O,U,C,H -> C is excluded? Yes -> no.

        ""pound"": P,O,U,N,D -> N is excluded? In guess1 N was x -> excluded. So no.

        ""boozy"": B,O,O,Z,Y -> has two O's? And Z and Y? 
            B, O, Z, Y -> all are allowed? We don't have any exclusion for these. So ""boozy"" is a word? Meaning: affected by alcohol, and it's 5 letters? Yes.

        But we don't know if the word has an O? But we are placing O in the second position. If there is another O, it might get a dash or an x? But we are primarily testing new letters.

        However, we might avoid duplicates because we don't know? Also, duplicate letters might complicate.

        Let's consider:

        ""boogy"" -> not a valid word? Actually, ""boggy"" has two G's -> but G is allowed? ""boggy"": B,O,G,G,Y -> but we haven't tried B,G,Y? Yes. And O is at position 2. But ""boggy"" is not a word? Valid word: ""bogey"" has E? E is excluded. Or ""boggy"" is valid? It means marshy. Yes.

        However, spelling: ""boggy"" -> 5 letters: B,O,G,G,Y. Second letter O.

        But we have two G's? We don't know how the feedback will handle duplicates? The secret word might have one G and then we might get one G marked and the other incorrect? It's tricky.

        We want to maximize new letters? So let's prefer a word without duplicates.

        Another word: ""dough"": D,O,U,G,H -> D,O,U,G,H -> all letters allowed? Yes. And all letters are new? Yes: D,O (we know O but we are testing new letters otherwise).

        ""dough"" is a valid word.

        ""booth"": B,O,O,T,H -> T is excluded from guess2? Yes, T was marked x -> excluded. So we cannot use T.

        ""brook"": B,R,... R is excluded -> no.

        Good options:
          - ""dough"": D,O,U,G,H -> letters D,U,G,H are new.
          - ""fouls"": F,O,U,L,S -> but S is excluded? Guess2: S was marked x -> excluded. So cannot use S.

        ""gouge"": G,O,U,G,E -> E excluded? Yes -> no.

        ""proud"": P,R,... R excluded -> no.

        ""wound"": W,O,U,N,D -> N excluded? Yes -> no.

        ""louse"": L,O,U,S,E -> S and E excluded -> no.

        ""boule"": B,O,U,L,E -> E excluded -> no.

        ""bound"": B,O,U,N,D -> N excluded -> no.

        ""hound"": H,O,U,N,D -> N excluded -> no.

        ""would"": W,O,U,L,D -> no excluded letters? We have W,O,U,L,D -> O is allowed, and W,U,L,D not excluded? Correct.

        ""would"": 
            W: not excluded? 
            U: not excluded? 
            L: not excluded? 
            D: not excluded?

        So yes.

        Another: ""could"" -> C excluded -> no.

        How about ""gowdy""? Not common. Or ""jowly"": J,O,W,L,Y -> valid word? Meaning: having prominent jowls. So letters J,O,W,L,Y -> all allowed? Yes.

        But J and Y are less common? We might avoid them? Or test? Since we need to cover letters.

        Alternatively, ""bowly"" is not a word.

        ""howdy"": H,O,W,D,Y -> valid. So ""howdy"" -> H,O,W,D,Y.

        Comparing ""would"", ""dough"", ""howdy"", and ""jowly"".

        We already have ""dough"" which uses D,U,G,H -> G and H are common? Yes.

        So let's list the words we can use:
          - ""would"": tests W,U,L,D -> positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:U, 4:L, 5:D
          - ""dough"": tests D,U,G,H -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:G, 5:H
          - ""howdy"": tests H,O,W,D,Y -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:W, 4:D, 5:Y
          - ""jowly"": tests J,O,W,L,Y -> positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:W, 4:L, 5:Y

        Since we don't have any information on vowels? We haven't tried U? So we might want to test U? So ""would"" or ""dough"" or ""howdy"" have U or Y? ""howdy"" has Y.

        It's a trade-off: 
          - ""dough"": covers D,U,G,H -> 4 new letters? Actually 5: D,O,U,G,H -> O we know is there, but we are testing the others.
          - ""would"": covers W,U,L,D -> also 4 new letters (if we don't count O) -> but we are testing W,U,L,D.
          - ""howdy"": tests H,O,W,D,Y -> H,W,D,Y -> 4 new letters? O is known. But we haven't tried H,W,D,Y.

        But note: we have only excluded C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T -> so 9 letters. We have many left.

        Another word: ""gulpy"" -> G,U,L,P,Y -> but O must be in second position? So ""gulpy"" is G,U,L,P,Y -> O not at position 2? So not.

        We need O at position 2.

        Another: ""folky"" -> F,O,L,K,Y -> K is allowed? Yes. But L is allowed? Yes. F,O,L,K,Y -> but we don't know about F,K,Y? So ""folky"": F,O,L,K,Y -> positions: 1:F,2:O,3:L,4:K,5:Y -> but we haven't tried F,L,K,Y? Yes.

        However, we must check: we haven't excluded F,L,K,Y? Correct.

        So options: 
          - ""would"", ""dough"", ""howdy"", ""folky"", ""jowly"", ""boxdy"" (not a word).

        Now, we want to test common letters? 
        Common letters remaining: L, D, U, G, H, P, B, etc.

        Actually, after excluding C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T, the next most common letters in English are: O (already known), then D, L, U, G, H, B, P.

        Therefore, we might choose a word that includes D, L, or U? And avoid rare letters like J, Z, etc.

        Let's prioritize:

          ""would"": uses W (uncommon), U, L (common), D (common) -> common: U,L,D.
          ""dough"": uses D (common), U (vowel), G (common), H (common) -> common: D,U,G,H.
          ""howdy"": H (common), W (uncommon), D (common), Y (common? but not as much) -> common: H,D,Y? But we are testing Y which is less common.

        Therefore, ""dough"" seems to cover more common letters: D,U,G,H -> all common.

        However, note: we are guessing ""dough"": 
            D at position 1 -> is D in the word?
            O at position 2 -> known correct.
            U at position 3 -> is U in the word?
            G at position 4 -> is G in the word?
            H at position 5 -> is H in the word?

        Alternatively, ""dough"" uses all new letters and covers D,U,G,H which are common and not yet tested.

        There's another word: ""bough"": B,O,U,G,H -> same as dough but with B? B is allowed? Yes. And common? Less common than D? B and D are both common. But we might test more common letters? Actually D is more common? In terms of frequency: D is about 4.25% or less? But in any case, we want to test a variety.

        But ""dough"" is fine.

        Another word: ""pound"" -> but N excluded? No, ""pound"" has N -> excluded -> invalid.

        So I think ""dough"" is a valid and good candidate.

        However, we have the option ""foggy"": F,O,G,G,Y -> but duplicate G? We avoid duplicates? Unless necessary? Also, Y might be less common? So ""dough"" is better because no duplication.

        Let's choose ""dough"".

        So our guess: dough

        Format: <guess>dough</guess>

        But wait, is there a reason to choose ""would"" over ""dough""? 

        ""would"" would test U and L and D and W? But W is less common? And U is a vowel we haven't tested.

        Given that we have no information on vowels? We have excluded A, E, I -> so the remaining vowels are O and U? And we know O is in the word. There might be another vowel? Typically, words have at least two vowels? So U is a good candidate? So both ""dough"" and ""would"" test U? 

        Actually, ""dough"" and ""would"" both test U? 
          - ""dough"": has U at position 3: so we test U at position 3.
          - ""would"": has U at position 3: also.

        So they both test U? Then ""dough"" tests additionally G and H? And ""would"" tests L? 

        Since L is common, we might want to test it? 

        But we can decide arbitrarily? 

        Actually, we can also consider ""gouhy""? Not a word.

        Final choice: ""dough"" because it tests 4 consonants? Or we can try ""lurky""? Not valid.

        Alternatively, what about ""dougy""? Not valid.

        We'll go with ""dough"".

        So the guess: doughBased on the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): Letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""moist""): 
  - M, I, S, T are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
  - O is correct and in the right position (marked ""✓"") → **The second letter is O**.

**Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, T  
**Known information**:  
- The secret word has 5 letters.  
- Second letter is O → Format: _ O _ _ _  

For the next guess:
- Must avoid excluded letters.  
- Focus on common unused letters (remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
- Prioritize testing vowels (like U) and frequent consonants (like D, G, H, L).  

A good candidate is **""dough""** because:  
- Second letter is O (required).  
- Tests new common letters: D, U, G, H (all untried).  
- Valid 5-letter word.  

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities by testing four new letters while leveraging the known ""O"" position.

<guess>dough</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
Guess 3: dough -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for three guesses:
1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the secret word -> excluded.
2. ""moist"": M, I, S, T are not in the word, and O is in the correct position (second letter) -> so we know the second letter is O.
3. ""dough"": D, U, G, H are not in the word, and O is again confirmed in the correct position (second letter) -> so we exclude D, U, G, H.

Now, we know:
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, T, D, U, G, H
- The secret word has the second letter O: _ O _ _ _

Remaining letters: B, F, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a 5-letter word that has O in the second position and uses only the remaining letters.

Let's list possible words:

We have very few letters left. The remaining letters are not very common, so we might have to use some of them.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ O _ _ _ and use only the allowed letters:

- ""jolly"": J, O, L, L, Y -> but we have two L's? And we haven't excluded L or Y? 
  - Positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? We haven't encountered any duplicate feedback so far? But we can try.

  However, we must check if ""jolly"" is valid? Yes, meaning cheerful.

- ""folly"": F, O, L, L, Y -> but F is allowed? Yes, and L, Y. But we have two L's? 
  - But note: F is not excluded? We haven't tried F. So ""folly"" is a candidate.

- ""polyp"": P, O, L, Y, P -> has two P's? And Y. Letters: P, O, L, Y, P -> but we haven't excluded P, L, Y? So valid? But ""polyp"" is a word? Yes, a type of growth.

- ""boxed"": B, O, X, E, D -> but E and D are excluded? E from guess1 and D from guess3 -> so not allowed.

- ""boxer"": B, O, X, E, R -> E and R excluded -> no.

- ""joked"": J, O, K, E, D -> E and D excluded -> no.

- ""lobby"": L, O, B, B, Y -> has two B's? And we haven't excluded L, B, Y? So ""lobby"" is a candidate? But note: the pattern is _ O _ _ _ -> so first letter L, second O, then B, B, Y? That would be L O B B Y -> 5 letters? Yes.

- ""poker"": P, O, K, E, R -> E and R excluded -> no.

- ""voter"": V, O, T, E, R -> T, E, R excluded -> no.

- ""woken"": W, O, K, E, N -> E and N excluded -> no.

- ""yolky"": Y, O, L, K, Y -> has two Y's? And we haven't excluded Y, L, K? So ""yolky"" is a candidate? Meaning: having a yolk. But note: first letter Y, second O, then L, K, Y.

- ""polka"": P, O, L, K, A -> A is excluded? From guess1 -> yes, A is excluded -> no.

- ""volva"": V, O, L, V, A -> A excluded and V repeated? Also, A excluded -> no.

- ""jowly"": J, O, W, L, Y -> we haven't excluded J, W, L, Y? So ""jowly"" is a candidate? But we tried ""jowly"" in the previous step? Actually, we didn't use it. And it has no duplicates? J, O, W, L, Y -> all distinct? Yes.

- ""howdy"": H is excluded? From guess3 -> H was marked x -> excluded. So no.

- ""lowly"": L, O, W, L, Y -> has two L's? And W, Y. But H is excluded? ""lowly"" doesn't have H? It has L,O,W,L,Y -> so letters: L, O, W, Y. But we have two L's? And we haven't excluded L, W, Y? So ""lowly"" is a candidate.

Now, we have several candidates: 
  - ""jolly"" (J,O,L,L,Y)
  - ""folly"" (F,O,L,L,Y)
  - ""polyp"" (P,O,L,Y,P) -> two P's
  - ""lobby"" (L,O,B,B,Y) -> two B's
  - ""yolky"" (Y,O,L,K,Y) -> two Y's
  - ""jowly"" (J,O,W,L,Y) -> all distinct
  - ""lowly"" (L,O,W,L,Y) -> two L's

We want to choose a word that maximizes the chance of getting information? Since we have many possibilities, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible without duplicates? But duplicates might be present? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses distinct letters to test more letters? So ""jowly"" has distinct letters? J, O, W, L, Y -> but O is already known, so we are testing J, W, L, Y? That's 4 new letters? And no duplicates.

Similarly, ""jolly"" has two L's? So we are testing J, L, Y? But L appears twice? So if L is in the word, we might get feedback on one or both? But it's less efficient? 

So we prefer words without duplicates? 

Therefore, ""jowly"" is a good candidate? It tests J, W, L, Y? And we know O is in the second position.

Another candidate without duplicates: ""jowly"" is one. 

What about ""boxed""? But E and D excluded? No.

""puffy""? P,U,F,F,Y -> U excluded? From guess3 -> U was marked x -> excluded. So no.

""kooky"": K,O,O,K,Y -> two O's? But we know O is in the word? But we are putting O in the second position? And then another O? But we don't know if there is a duplicate O? Also, K and Y? But we haven't excluded K? So ""kooky"" is a candidate? But it has two O's and two K's? So duplicates.

""jowly"" seems the best? 

But let's check if there is a word with more common letters? The remaining letters are not very common? But we have to use them.

Another word: ""vozhd""? Not English? 

""woozy"": W,O,O,Z,Y -> two O's? And Z? But we haven't excluded W, Z, Y? So ""woozy"" is a candidate? But it has two O's? And we are testing W, Z, Y? But we don't know if the word has another O? 

But we are trying to avoid duplicates? So ""jowly"" is better? 

Alternatively, ""polly"": P,O,L,L,Y -> two L's? And we haven't excluded P, L, Y? So ""polly"" is a candidate? But duplicate L.

I think ""jowly"" is a good choice because it has no duplicates and tests 4 new letters: J, W, L, Y.

So we'll go with ""jowly"".

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid? ""jowly"" is a valid English word? Yes, meaning having heavy or sagging cheeks.

So guess: jowly

Format: <guess>jowly</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → Excluded.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**: 
  - O is correct and in position 2 (✓).  
  - M, I, S, T are absent (x) → Excluded.
- **Guess 3 (dough)**:
  - O is confirmed in position 2 (✓).  
  - D, U, G, H are absent (x) → Excluded.  

**Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, T, D, U, G, H  
**Known Position**:  
- The second letter is **O** → Secret word format: `_ O _ _ _`  

**Remaining Letters**: B, F, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The secret word must have **O** in position 2 and use only the remaining letters.  
- Prioritize words with **distinct new letters** to maximize information (avoid duplicates).  
- Test high-frequency remaining consonants (L, P, B, Y) and vowels (Y) where possible.  
- **""jowly""** fits perfectly:  
  - `J` (position 1), `O` (position 2, confirmed), `W` (position 3), `L` (position 4), `Y` (position 5).  
  - Uses 4 new letters (J, W, L, Y), all distinct and untested.  
  - Valid 5-letter word (meaning: having prominent jowls).  

This guess efficiently tests critical letters while respecting the known constraints.

We have excluded 5: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z\n Remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are excluded)\n\n We should try to cover as many common letters as possible. Common letters in English include S, T, L, O, etc.\n\n Since we have no information, we want a word that uses common letters from the remaining set.\n\n Some common letters from the remaining set: S, T, L, O, I, U, D, H, M, P, etc.\n\n We can try a word that has a mix of vowels and consonants. For example, using O and I as vowels.\n\n Possible words: \n   - ""TOILS"" -> but we don\'t know if S is available? Actually, we haven\'t ruled out S. However, we must avoid the excluded letters.\n\n Let\'s list words without C, R, A, N, E.\n\n Some options:\n   - ""GHOUL"" -> 5 letters? No, that\'s 5: G, H, O, U, L -> but we have 5 letters? Actually, ""ghoul"" is 5 letters.\n   - ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S -> 5 letters.\n\n However, we might want to use more common letters. Let\'s try:\n\n   - ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H -> all are allowed? Yes, because none of these are in {C, R, A, N, E}.\n   - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> also allowed.\n\n But note: we want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters. The most common consonants left are S, T, L, and then M, P, etc. and vowels O, I.\n\n Another good candidate: ""OUIJA"" is not common and has J which is less common.\n\n Alternatively, ""PILOT"" -> P, I, L, O, T -> but L and T are common.\n\n However, we must ensure the word is valid.\n\n Let me choose ""MOIST"" because it uses M, O, I, S, T which are common and we haven\'t tried.\n\n But note: we are avoiding E and A, so we have to use O, I, U. ""MOIST"" uses O and I.\n\n Alternatively, ""SHOUT"" -> S, H, O, U, T -> also valid.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it covers two vowels (O, I) and three common consonants (M, S, T).\n\n However, we have to be cautious: we don\'t know if the word has duplicates? But the feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates so far, but the secret word might have duplicates. But we are not using any duplicate in our guess.\n\n Let\'s go with ""MOIST"".\n\n But wait, what about ""BUILD""? B, U, I, L, D -> but we don\'t have B, D, L in the excluded set. However, we haven\'t tried B or D. But we want to cover more common letters? S and T are more common than B and D.\n\n Another option: ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> but Y is sometimes a vowel, and we have O and U.\n\n However, I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.\n\n Alternatively, ""HOIST"" is similar to ""MOIST"" but with H instead of M. H is less common than M? Actually, both are common.\n\n But we are going for maximum coverage. Since we have no information, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n We are going to use ""MOIST"".\n\n So, the next guess: ""moist""\n\n Format: <guess>moist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (all letters marked as ""x""), I know that the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For my next guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely to test new common letters. \n\nI\'ll prioritize frequent consonants like S, T, L, M, and vowels like O, I, U. A good candidate is **""moist""** because:\n- It uses 5 new, common letters (M, O, I, S, T).\n- It covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants.\n- It avoids the excluded letters from the first guess.\n\nThis guess maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback by testing high-frequency letters not yet attempted.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n1.

Guess: moist -> Feedback: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)\n   This tells us:\n      - O is in the word and in the correct position (since it got a checkmark). Specifically, O is the second letter because in ""moist"", O is at position 2 (positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T).\n   Therefore, the second letter of the secret word is O.\n   Also, M, I, S, T are not in the word. So we can exclude M, I, S, T.\n\nNow, we know:\n   Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T\n   Required: The second letter is O.\n\nWe need to guess a 5-letter word that:\n   - Has O as the second letter.\n   - Contains none of the excluded letters (C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T).\n   - Uses other letters from the English alphabet.\n\nRemaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nWe also note that we have not used many common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are O (but we already know the position) and U (and sometimes Y). But O is already placed, so we need to use other vowels? Actually, we don\'t know if there are other vowels in the word. The remaining vowels available: U, and Y (if considered vowel) or sometimes consonants? But we\'ll treat Y as a possible vowel.\n\nWe need to form a word in the form: _ O _ _ _ \n\nPossible letters for the other positions: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe should try to cover as many common letters as possible to gather information.\n\nCommon remaining consonants: H, L, D, P, G, B, etc.\nRemaining vowels: U (and Y).\n\nLet\'s think of words that have O as the second letter and are composed of the remaining letters.\n\nSome candidates:\n   - G O L D ... but ""gold"" is only 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So we need 5-letter words.\n   - Possible words: \n        * ""fouls"" -> but S is excluded? Wait, S is excluded from guess 2 (S was marked x). So we can\'t use S.\n        * ""gouge"" -> E is excluded? E is excluded from guess 1 (E was marked x). So no.\n        * ""pound"" -> P,O,U,N,D -> but N is excluded? In guess1, N was marked x -> excluded. So no N.\n        * ""bough"": B,O,U,G,H -> letters: B,O,U,G,H. \n            - Check excluded: B, O (we know O is in, but we can use O again? Actually, the feedback for O was correct, but we don\'t know if there are multiple O\'s. The feedback only told us about one O. The feedback format does not explicitly show duplicates. However, if we use O again, we might get a \'-\' or \'x\'. But note: we don\'t have any information about duplicate O\'s. However, in ""moist"", O was correct and the rest were not. So if the word had another O, it would have been marked by either \'-\' in another position or ✓ if in that same position? But we didn\'t have any other O. So we cannot rule out another O? But the word might contain O only once.\n\n        However, we must avoid excluded letters: B is not excluded? We haven\'t tried B. So ""bough"" seems okay? \n        But we need to check the letters: \n            B: not excluded\n            O: we know it\'s in the word, but we are placing it again? Actually, we are forced to put O in the second position. The word must have O in the second position. So we cannot put O in another position? Actually, we can, but we should avoid repeating letters if we aren\'t sure? Since we don\'t know if there is a duplicate, we can use letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n        But let\'s look for words without duplicates unless necessary.\n\n   - ""hobby"": H,O,B,B,Y -> duplicates B and Y. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? Yes, but we don\'t know. However, we haven\'t tried H, B, Y so we might test new letters.\n\n   - Better words:\n\n        ""tough"" -> but T is excluded? In guess2, T was marked x -> excluded. So we cannot use T.\n\n        ""could"" -> C and U and L and D: but C is excluded -> no.\n\n        ""would"" -> W,O,U,L,D: W is allowed? Yes, because we haven\'t tried W. U and L and D are allowed? Yes. So ""would"" -> letters: W,O,U,L,D -> all except O are new.\n\n        But we have excluded A,C,E,I,M,N,R,S,T -> so yes.\n\n        ""would"": \n            Position: W (1), O (2), U (3), L (4), D (5)\n            This uses new letters: W, U, L, D.\n\n        Another word: ""joule"" -> J,O,U,L,E -> E is excluded? E was x in guess1 -> excluded. So not allowed.\n\n        ""vouch"" -> V,O,U,C,H -> C is excluded? Yes -> no.\n\n        ""pound"": P,O,U,N,D -> N is excluded? In guess1 N was x -> excluded. So no.\n\n        ""boozy"": B,O,O,Z,Y -> has two O\'s? And Z and Y? \n            B, O, Z, Y -> all are allowed? We don\'t have any exclusion for these. So ""boozy"" is a word? Meaning: affected by alcohol, and it\'s 5 letters? Yes.\n\n        But we don\'t know if the word has an O? But we are placing O in the second position. If there is another O, it might get a dash or an x? But we are primarily testing new letters.\n\n        However, we might avoid duplicates because we don\'t know? Also, duplicate letters might complicate.\n\n        Let\'s consider:\n\n        ""boogy"" -> not a valid word? Actually, ""boggy"" has two G\'s -> but G is allowed? ""boggy"": B,O,G,G,Y -> but we haven\'t tried B,G,Y? Yes. And O is at position 2. But ""boggy"" is not a word? Valid word: ""bogey"" has E? E is excluded. Or ""boggy"" is valid? It means marshy. Yes.\n\n        However, spelling: ""boggy"" -> 5 letters: B,O,G,G,Y. Second letter O.\n\n        But we have two G\'s? We don\'t know how the feedback will handle duplicates? The secret word might have one G and then we might get one G marked and the other incorrect? It\'s tricky.\n\n        We want to maximize new letters? So let\'s prefer a word without duplicates.\n\n        Another word: ""dough"": D,O,U,G,H -> D,O,U,G,H -> all letters allowed? Yes. And all letters are new? Yes: D,O (we know O but we are testing new letters otherwise).\n\n        ""dough"" is a valid word.\n\n        ""booth"": B,O,O,T,H -> T is excluded from guess2? Yes, T was marked x -> excluded. So we cannot use T.\n\n        ""brook"": B,R,... R is excluded -> no.\n\n        Good options:\n          - ""dough"": D,O,U,G,H -> letters D,U,G,H are new.\n          - ""fouls"": F,O,U,L,S -> but S is excluded? Guess2: S was marked x -> excluded. So cannot use S.\n\n        ""gouge"": G,O,U,G,E -> E excluded? Yes -> no.\n\n        ""proud"": P,R,... R excluded -> no.\n\n        ""wound"": W,O,U,N,D -> N excluded? Yes -> no.\n\n        ""louse"": L,O,U,S,E -> S and E excluded -> no.\n\n        ""boule"": B,O,U,L,E -> E excluded -> no.\n\n        ""bound"": B,O,U,N,D -> N excluded -> no.\n\n        ""hound"": H,O,U,N,D -> N excluded -> no.\n\n        ""would"": W,O,U,L,D -> no excluded letters? We have W,O,U,L,D -> O is allowed, and W,U,L,D not excluded? Correct.\n\n        ""would"": \n            W: not excluded? \n            U: not excluded? \n            L: not excluded? \n            D: not excluded?\n\n        So yes.\n\n        Another: ""could"" -> C excluded -> no.\n\n        How about ""gowdy""? Not common. Or ""jowly"": J,O,W,L,Y -> valid word? Meaning: having prominent jowls. So letters J,O,W,L,Y -> all allowed? Yes.\n\n        But J and Y are less common? We might avoid them? Or test? Since we need to cover letters.\n\n        Alternatively, ""bowly"" is not a word.\n\n        ""howdy"": H,O,W,D,Y -> valid. So ""howdy"" -> H,O,W,D,Y.\n\n        Comparing ""would"", ""dough"", ""howdy"", and ""jowly"".\n\n        We already have ""dough"" which uses D,U,G,H -> G and H are common? Yes.\n\n        So let\'s list the words we can use:\n          - ""would"": tests W,U,L,D -> positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:U, 4:L, 5:D\n          - ""dough"": tests D,U,G,H -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:G, 5:H\n          - ""howdy"": tests H,O,W,D,Y -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:W, 4:D, 5:Y\n          - ""jowly"": tests J,O,W,L,Y -> positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:W, 4:L, 5:Y\n\n        Since we don\'t have any information on vowels? We haven\'t tried U? So we might want to test U? So ""would"" or ""dough"" or ""howdy"" have U or Y? ""howdy"" has Y.\n\n        It\'s a trade-off: \n          - ""dough"": covers D,U,G,H -> 4 new letters? Actually 5: D,O,U,G,H -> O we know is there, but we are testing the others.\n          - ""would"": covers W,U,L,D -> also 4 new letters (if we don\'t count O) -> but we are testing W,U,L,D.\n          - ""howdy"": tests H,O,W,D,Y -> H,W,D,Y -> 4 new letters? O is known. But we haven\'t tried H,W,D,Y.\n\n        But note: we have only excluded C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T -> so 9 letters. We have many left.\n\n        Another word: ""gulpy"" -> G,U,L,P,Y -> but O must be in second position? So ""gulpy"" is G,U,L,P,Y -> O not at position 2? So not.\n\n        We need O at position 2.\n\n        Another: ""folky"" -> F,O,L,K,Y -> K is allowed? Yes. But L is allowed? Yes. F,O,L,K,Y -> but we don\'t know about F,K,Y? So ""folky"": F,O,L,K,Y -> positions: 1:F,2:O,3:L,4:K,5:Y -> but we haven\'t tried F,L,K,Y? Yes.\n\n        However, we must check: we haven\'t excluded F,L,K,Y? Correct.\n\n        So options: \n          - ""would"", ""dough"", ""howdy"", ""folky"", ""jowly"", ""boxdy"" (not a word).\n\n        Now, we want to test common letters? \n        Common letters remaining: L, D, U, G, H, P, B, etc.\n\n        Actually, after excluding C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,T, the next most common letters in English are: O (already known), then D, L, U, G, H, B, P.\n\n        Therefore, we might choose a word that includes D, L, or U? And avoid rare letters like J, Z, etc.\n\n        Let\'s prioritize:\n\n          ""would"": uses W (uncommon), U, L (common), D (common) -> common: U,L,D.\n          ""dough"": uses D (common), U (vowel), G (common), H (common) -> common: D,U,G,H.\n          ""howdy"": H (common), W (uncommon), D (common), Y (common? but not as much) -> common: H,D,Y? But we are testing Y which is less common.\n\n        Therefore, ""dough"" seems to cover more common letters: D,U,G,H -> all common.\n\n        However, note: we are guessing ""dough"": \n            D at position 1 -> is D in the word?\n            O at position 2 -> known correct.\n            U at position 3 -> is U in the word?\n            G at position 4 -> is G in the word?\n            H at position 5 -> is H in the word?\n\n        Alternatively, ""dough"" uses all new letters and covers D,U,G,H which are common and not yet tested.\n\n        There\'s another word: ""bough"": B,O,U,G,H -> same as dough but with B? B is allowed? Yes. And common? Less common than D? B and D are both common. But we might test more common letters? Actually D is more common? In terms of frequency: D is about 4.25% or less? But in any case, we want to test a variety.\n\n        But ""dough"" is fine.\n\n        Another word: ""pound"" -> but N excluded? No, ""pound"" has N -> excluded -> invalid.\n\n        So I think ""dough"" is a valid and good candidate.\n\n        However, we have the option ""foggy"": F,O,G,G,Y -> but duplicate G? We avoid duplicates? Unless necessary? Also, Y might be less common? So ""dough"" is better because no duplication.\n\n        Let\'s choose ""dough"".\n\n        So our guess: dough\n\n        Format: <guess>dough</guess>\n\n        But wait, is there a reason to choose ""would"" over ""dough""? \n\n        ""would"" would test U and L and D and W? But W is less common? And U is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\n        Given that we have no information on vowels? We have excluded A, E, I -> so the remaining vowels are O and U? And we know O is in the word. There might be another vowel? Typically, words have at least two vowels? So U is a good candidate? So both ""dough"" and ""would"" test U? \n\n        Actually, ""dough"" and ""would"" both test U? \n          - ""dough"": has U at position 3: so we test U at position 3.\n          - ""would"": has U at position 3: also.\n\n        So they both test U? Then ""dough"" tests additionally G and H? And ""would"" tests L? \n\n        Since L is common, we might want to test it? \n\n        But we can decide arbitrarily? \n\n        Actually, we can also consider ""gouhy""? Not a word.\n\n        Final choice: ""dough"" because it tests 4 consonants? Or we can try ""lurky""? Not valid.\n\n        Alternatively, what about ""dougy""? Not valid.\n\n        We\'ll go with ""dough"".\n\n        So the guess: doughBased on the feedback:\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): Letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.\n- From Guess 2 (""moist""): \n  - M, I, S, T are not in the word (all marked ""x"").\n  - O is correct and in the right position (marked ""✓"") → **The second letter is O**.\n\n**Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, T  \n**Known information**:  \n- The secret word has 5 letters.  \n- Second letter is O → Format: _ O _ _ _  \n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must avoid excluded letters.  \n- Focus on common unused letters (remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  \n- Prioritize testing vowels (like U) and frequent consonants (like D, G, H, L).  \n\nA good candidate is **""dough""** because:  \n- Second letter is O (required).  \n- Tests new common letters: D, U, G, H (all untried).  \n- Valid 5-letter word.  \n\nThis guess efficiently narrows possibilities by testing four new letters while leveraging the known ""O"" position.\n\n<guess>dough</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: dough -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for three guesses:\n1.

Yes, and L, Y. But we have two L\'s? \n  - But note: F is not excluded? We haven\'t tried F. So ""folly"" is a candidate.\n\n- ""polyp"": P, O, L, Y, P -> has two P\'s? And Y. Letters: P, O, L, Y, P -> but we haven\'t excluded P, L, Y? So valid? But ""polyp"" is a word? Yes, a type of growth.\n\n- ""boxed"": B, O, X, E, D -> but E and D are excluded?

So ""lowly"" is a candidate.\n\nNow, we have several candidates: \n  - ""jolly"" (J,O,L,L,Y)\n  - ""folly"" (F,O,L,L,Y)\n  - ""polyp"" (P,O,L,Y,P) -> two P\'s\n  - ""lobby"" (L,O,B,B,Y) -> two B\'s\n  - ""yolky"" (Y,O,L,K,Y) -> two Y\'s\n  - ""jowly"" (J,O,W,L,Y) -> all distinct\n  - ""lowly"" (L,O,W,L,Y) -> two L\'s\n\nWe want to choose a word that maximizes the chance of getting information? Since we have many possibilities, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible without duplicates? But duplicates might be present? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that uses distinct letters to test more letters? So ""jowly"" has distinct letters? J, O, W, L, Y -> but O is already known, so we are testing J, W, L, Y? That\'s 4 new letters? And no duplicates.\n\nSimilarly, ""jolly"" has two L\'s? So we are testing J, L, Y? But L appears twice? So if L is in the word, we might get feedback on one or both? But it\'s less efficient? \n\nSo we prefer words without duplicates? \n\nTherefore, ""jowly"" is a good candidate? It tests J, W, L, Y? And we know O is in the second position.\n\nAnother candidate without duplicates: ""jowly"" is one. \n\nWhat about ""boxed""? But E and D excluded? No.\n\n""puffy""? P,U,F,F,Y -> U excluded? From guess3 -> U was marked x -> excluded. So no.\n\n""kooky"": K,O,O,K,Y -> two O\'s? But we know O is in the word? But we are putting O in the second position? And then another O? But we don\'t know if there is a duplicate O? Also, K and Y? But we haven\'t excluded K? So ""kooky"" is a candidate? But it has two O\'s and two K\'s? So duplicates.\n\n""jowly"" seems the best? \n\nBut let\'s check if there is a word with more common letters? The remaining letters are not very common? But we have to use them.\n\nAnother word: ""vozhd""? Not English? \n\n""woozy"": W,O,O,Z,Y -> two O\'s? And Z? But we haven\'t excluded W, Z, Y? So ""woozy"" is a candidate? But it has two O\'s? And we are testing W, Z, Y? But we don\'t know if the word has another O? \n\nBut we are trying to avoid duplicates? So ""jowly"" is better? \n\nAlternatively, ""polly"": P,O,L,L,Y -> two L\'s? And we haven\'t excluded P, L, Y? So ""polly"" is a candidate? But duplicate L.\n\nI think ""jowly"" is a good choice because it has no duplicates and tests 4 new letters: J, W, L, Y.\n\nSo we\'ll go with ""jowly"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure the word is valid? ""jowly"" is a valid English word? Yes, meaning having heavy or sagging cheeks.\n\nSo guess: jowly\n\nFormat: <guess>jowly</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → Excluded.\n- **Guess 2 (moist)**: \n  - O is correct and in position 2 (✓).  \n  - M, I, S, T are absent (x) → Excluded.\n- **Guess 3 (dough)**:\n  - O is confirmed in position 2 (✓).  \n  - D, U, G, H are absent (x) → Excluded.  \n\n**Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, T, D, U, G, H  \n**Known Position**:  \n- The second letter is **O** → Secret word format: `_ O _ _ _`  \n\n**Remaining Letters**: B, F, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- The secret word must have **O** in position 2 and use only the remaining letters.  \n- Prioritize words with **distinct new letters** to maximize information (avoid duplicates).  \n- Test high-frequency remaining consonants (L, P, B, Y) and vowels (Y) where possible.  \n- **""jowly""** fits perfectly:  \n  - `J` (position 1), `O` (position 2, confirmed), `W` (position 3), `L` (position 4), `Y` (position 5).  \n  - Uses 4 new letters (J, W, L, Y), all distinct and untested.  \n  - Valid 5-letter word (meaning: having prominent jowls).  \n\nThis guess efficiently tests critical letters while respecting the known constraints.\n\n<guess>jowly</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: dough -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)\nGuess 4: jowly -> FEEDBACK: J(x) O(✓) W(-) L(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for four guesses:
1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the secret word -> excluded.
2. ""moist"": M, I, S, T are not in the word, and O is in the correct position (second letter) -> so we know the second letter is O.
3. ""dough"": D, U, G, H are not in the word, and O is again confirmed in the correct position (second letter) -> so exclude D, U, G, H.
4. ""jowly"": Feedback: J(x) O(✓) W(-) L(x) Y(✓)
   - J is not in the word -> exclude J.
   - O is in the correct position (second letter) -> confirmed.
   - W is in the word but in the wrong position -> so W is present in the secret word, but not at position 3.
   - L is not in the word -> exclude L.
   - Y is in the correct position -> so the fifth letter is Y.

Now, we know:
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, T, D, U, G, H, J, L
- The secret word has the second letter O and the fifth letter Y: _ O _ _ Y
- W is in the word, but not at position 3.

Remaining letters: B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z  (and W is in the word, but we don't know the position)

But note: W is already in the word, so we don't need to test for W again? But we need to find its position.

The word is of the form: _ O _ _ Y

We know W is in the word, but not at position 3. So W must be at position 1 or 4? Because position 2 is O and position 5 is Y, and position 3 is not W (from feedback). So W can be at position 1 or 4.

Also, the word must be composed of the remaining letters and W. The remaining letters we can use for the unknown positions (1, 3, 4) are: B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z, and W (but W is already in the word, so we can use it again? But we don't know if there are duplicates? The feedback hasn't shown any duplicate so far? But we can't assume. However, we have no information about duplicates? So we should avoid using W again? Actually, we know W is in the word, so we can use it in a different position? But we are not sure if it appears twice? So we might avoid using it again? Or we can? But to be safe, we can try to use new letters? But we have very few letters left.

Actually, we have to fill positions 1, 3, and 4. We know position 2 is O and position 5 is Y.

The word: [1] O [3] [4] Y

Constraints:
- W is in the word and not at position 3 -> so W must be at position 1 or 4.
- The letters at positions 1, 3, 4 must be from the set: B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z, and W (but we don't know if we can use W again? We are not forced to use it again? We can use it only once? But the word might have only one W? So we should not use W again? Actually, we are trying to guess the word, so we can use W in a position we think it might be? But we have two possibilities: position 1 or 4.

We can form words that fit the pattern and include W at position 1 or 4, and the other positions from the remaining letters.

But note: we have excluded many letters, so the possibilities are limited.

Let's list possible words:

First, if W is at position 1: W O _ _ Y
Then the third and fourth positions must be filled with two letters from: B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.

But we need to form a valid English word.

Possible words:
- ""woofy"": W O O F Y -> but O is already at position 2? And we are putting O at position 3? But we don't know if O is duplicated? Also, we have excluded many letters? But F is allowed? However, ""woofy"" has two O's? And we are putting O at position 3? But we don't know if the word has two O's? The feedback for ""moist"" and ""dough"" only showed one O? But it could have two? However, in ""jowly"", we didn't have an O at position 3? But we didn't test for O at position 3? Actually, we have only seen O at position 2. So it's possible? But let's check: ""woofy"" is a word? Meaning: having a texture of wool? Or like a dog? Not common. But valid? We'll consider.

  But note: we have to use the remaining letters? F is allowed? So ""woofy"": W(1), O(2), O(3), F(4), Y(5) -> but we are putting O at position 3? And we already know O at position 2? So if the word has two O's, then in ""jowly"", we didn't have an O at position 3? But we didn't test O at position 3? So it's possible? But the feedback for ""jowly"" didn't show an O? Because we didn't put O in the guess? We put J, O, W, L, Y -> so O was at position 2 and correct, and we didn't put O elsewhere? So we don't know about other O's? So ""woofy"" is a candidate? But we are using O again? And we don't know if it's allowed? Actually, we are not excluding O? But we know O is in the word? So we can use it? But we are trying to find the word? So we can.

  However, we are using two O's? But the secret word might have only one O? Then we would get feedback that one O is correct and the other is not? But we are not sure? So it's risky? We have only 2 guesses left? (since we are on guess 5, and we have 6 tries total? We started with 1: crane, 2: moist, 3: dough, 4: jowly, so this is guess 5, and we have one more after if needed? But we want to solve in 5?).

  Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates? So we can look for words without duplicate O? 

  But in ""woofy"", we are using O at position 3? So if the secret word has only one O (at position 2), then the O at position 3 would be marked as absent? But we don't know? So we might get confused? 

  So let's avoid using O again? We are not forced to? We can use only the remaining letters and W? 

  So for W at position 1: W O [3] [4] Y -> positions 3 and 4 must be filled with two letters from B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z (and not O? because we are avoiding duplicate O? and we don't know if it's duplicated? but to be safe, we avoid?).

  What words? 
    - ""woopy"": W O O P Y -> again O at position 3? same issue? and P? but ""woopy"" is not a word? 
    - ""wooly"": W O O L Y -> but L is excluded? from guess4: L was marked x -> excluded. So no.
    - ""woofy"": as above? 
    - ""woply"": not a word.

  Actually, I can't think of a word with W at position 1 and no duplicate O? 

  Now, if W is at position 4: then the word is [1] O [3] W Y

  Then we need to fill position 1 and 3 with letters from B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.

  Possible words:
    - ""bowwy"": B O W W Y -> duplicate W? and we don't know? Also, ""bowwy"" not a word.
    - ""powwy"": not a word.
    - ""vowly"": V O W L Y -> but L excluded? no.
    - ""fowcy"": not a word.
    - ""kowly"": K O W L Y -> L excluded? no.
    - ""powny"": P O W N Y -> N excluded? from guess1 -> excluded. no.
    - ""boxwy"": B O X W Y -> valid? ""boxwy"" is not a word? 
    - ""foxwy"": not a word.

  How about ""pocky"": P O C K Y -> C excluded? no.

  I'm struggling. 

  Another idea: what if the word has W at position 1 and we use other letters? 

  We have to use the remaining letters: B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.

  For W at position 1: W O [3] [4] Y

  We need a word: W O ? ? Y

  Let me search for words: 
    - ""wooly"": excluded because L is excluded? and also has O at position 3? 
    - ""woofy"": W O O F Y -> F is allowed? and we are using O at position 3? 
    - ""woopy"": not a word? 
    - ""woxly"": not a word? 
    - ""wozzy"": W O Z Z Y -> Z is allowed? and ""wozzy"" is not a word? 

  But ""woozy"": W O O Z Y -> but we have two O's? and Z? ""woozy"" is a word? Meaning: dizzy. Yes! 

  So ""woozy"": W(1), O(2), O(3), Z(4), Y(5) -> but we are using O at position 3? 

  Now, we don't know if the secret word has two O's? But we haven't tested for O at position 3? So it's possible? 

  Also, we have Z? which is allowed? 

  So ""woozy"" is a candidate? 

  But we have to consider: if the secret word is ""woozy"", then the feedback for ""jowly"" would have been: 
      J (x), O (✓), W (?) -> but W was marked as (-) meaning present but wrong position? 
      In ""jowly"", W is at position 3? 
      In ""woozy"", W is at position 1? So that matches: W is present but not at position 3? 
      Also, L (x) and Y (✓) -> correct? 

  So ""woozy"" is consistent? 

  But we have to check if it uses only allowed letters? 
      W, O, O, Z, Y -> O is allowed? We know it's in the word? Z is not excluded? Y is allowed? 
      But we are using O twice? And we don't know if the word has two O's? 

  Alternatively, we can consider if W is at position 4? 

  What words have W at position 4? [1] O [3] W Y

  We need a word: ? O ? W Y

  With the remaining letters for positions 1 and 3: B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.

  Possibilities:
    - ""bowwy"": not a word? 
    - ""powwy"": not a word?
    - ""fowpy"": not a word?
    - ""vowpy"": not a word?
    - ""kowwy"": not a word?
    - ""poway"": P O W A Y -> A excluded? no.
    - ""boxwy"": not a word.

  I can't find a word? 

  What about ""pobby""? P O B B Y -> but no W? But we know W must be in the word? So we must include W? 

  So if W is at position 4, then the word must have W at 4? 

  But we can't find a word? 

  Another possibility: ""bawdy"": B A W D Y -> A and D excluded? no.

  So it seems the only candidate is ""woozy""? 

  But let's check if there are other words? 

  What about ""jowly"" feedback: we have W marked as present but wrong position? So W is not at 3? 

  In ""woozy"", W is at 1? So that's a different position? So it matches? 

  Also, we have to make sure we haven't excluded any letter in ""woozy"": 
      W: not excluded? 
      O: not excluded? 
      Z: not excluded? 
      Y: not excluded? 

  And the pattern: W O O Z Y -> positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:O, 4:Z, 5:Y? But we know the fifth letter is Y? And second is O? So that matches? 

  But we are using O at position 3? We don't know if that is correct? 

  Alternatively, is there a word with W at position 1 and no duplicate O? 

  For example, ""woofy"": W O O F Y -> same issue? 

  Or ""woozy"" is the only common word? 

  Another word: ""wormy"": W O R M Y -> R and M excluded? no.

  ""wonty"": W O N T Y -> N and T excluded? no.

  So I think ""woozy"" is the best candidate? 

  But we have to consider: what if the word has W at position 4? 

  We thought of ""howdy""? But H excluded? 

  ""lowly"": L excluded? 

  ""bowly"": B O W L Y -> L excluded? 

  ""poway"": not a word? 

  ""vozhd"": not English? 

  So I think ""woozy"" is the only common word that fits? 

  Therefore, we guess ""woozy"".

  But note: we have only 2 guesses left? We are on guess 5? And we have 6 tries? So if we are wrong, we have one more? 

  Alternatively, we can try to test without committing to the duplicate O? But we don't have many options? 

  Another candidate: ""boxwy"" is not a word? 

  So we go with ""woozy"".

  Format: <guess>woozy</guess>

  But let's double-check the feedback for ""jowly"": 
      We had: J(x) O(✓) W(-) L(x) Y(✓)
      For ""woozy"": 
        - J is not in -> correct.
        - O at position 2 -> correct.
        - W is in the word but not at position 3 -> in ""woozy"", W is at position 1 -> so it should be marked as present but wrong position? Correct.
        - L is not in -> correct.
        - Y at position 5 -> correct.

  So consistent.

  And for ""dough"": D,U,G,H not in -> consistent.

  And for ""moist"": O correct, others not -> consistent.

  And for ""crane"": all not -> consistent.

  So ""woozy"" is a valid candidate.

  We'll guess ""woozy"".
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent → Excluded.  
- **Guess 2 (moist)**:  
  - O correct and in position 2 (✓).  
  - M, I, S, T absent (x) → Excluded.  
- **Guess 3 (dough)**:  
  - O confirmed in position 2 (✓).  
  - D, U, G, H absent (x) → Excluded.  
- **Guess 4 (jowly)**:  
  - J absent (x) → Excluded.  
  - O confirmed in position 2 (✓).  
  - W present but wrong position (-) → **W is in the word, not at position 3**.  
  - L absent (x) → Excluded.  
  - Y correct and in position 5 (✓) → **Fifth letter is Y**.  

**Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, T, D, U, G, H, J, L  
**Known Positions**:  
- Position 2: **O**  
- Position 5: **Y**  
**Present Letter (Wrong Position)**:  
- **W** (not at position 3)  

**Secret Word Pattern**: `_ O _ _ Y`  
- W must be at position 1 or 4 (since positions 2, 3, and 5 are occupied or invalid for W).  
- Remaining allowed letters: B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z (and W, which is already confirmed present).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The only word fitting the constraints is **""woozy""**:  
  - `W` at position 1 (tests W in a new position).  
  - `O` at position 2 (confirmed).  
  - `O` at position 3 (plausible, as duplicates haven't been ruled out).  
  - `Z` at position 4 (new letter).  
  - `Y` at position 5 (confirmed).  
- ""Woozy"" (meaning dizzy) uses allowed letters and aligns with feedback:  
  - W is present but not at position 3 (fits position 1).  
  - Tests Z, a high-value remaining consonant.  
- If correct, this solves the puzzle. If not, the feedback will confirm/deny the duplicate O and Z's status.  

<guess>woozy</guess>",woozy,"We are given feedback for four guesses:
1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the secret word -> excluded.
2. ""moist"": M, I, S, T are not in the word, and O is in the correct position (second letter) -> so we know the second letter is O.
3. ""dough"": D, U, G, H are not in the word, and O is again confirmed in the correct position (second letter) -> so exclude D, U, G, H.
4. ""jowly"": Feedback: J(x) O(✓) W(-) L(x) Y(✓)
   - J is not in the word -> exclude J.
   - O is in the correct position (second letter) -> confirmed.
   - W is in the word but in the wrong position -> so W is present in the secret word, but not at position 3.
   - L is not in the word -> exclude L.
   - Y is in the correct position -> so the fifth letter is Y.

Now, we know:
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, T, D, U, G, H, J, L
- The secret word has the second letter O and the fifth letter Y: _ O _ _ Y
- W is in the word, but not at position 3.

Remaining letters: B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z  (and W is in the word, but we don't know the position)

But note: W is already in the word, so we don't need to test for W again? But we need to find its position.

The word is of the form: _ O _ _ Y

We know W is in the word, but not at position 3. So W must be at position 1 or 4? Because position 2 is O and position 5 is Y, and position 3 is not W (from feedback). So W can be at position 1 or 4.

Also, the word must be composed of the remaining letters and W. The remaining letters we can use for the unknown positions (1, 3, 4) are: B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z, and W (but W is already in the word, so we can use it again? But we don't know if there are duplicates? The feedback hasn't shown any duplicate so far? But we can't assume. However, we have no information about duplicates? So we should avoid using W again? Actually, we know W is in the word, so we can use it in a different position? But we are not sure if it appears twice? So we might avoid using it again? Or we can? But to be safe, we can try to use new letters? But we have very few letters left.

Actually, we have to fill positions 1, 3, and 4. We know position 2 is O and position 5 is Y.

The word: [1] O [3] [4] Y

Constraints:
- W is in the word and not at position 3 -> so W must be at position 1 or 4.
- The letters at positions 1, 3, 4 must be from the set: B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z, and W (but we don't know if we can use W again? We are not forced to use it again? We can use it only once? But the word might have only one W? So we should not use W again? Actually, we are trying to guess the word, so we can use W in a position we think it might be? But we have two possibilities: position 1 or 4.

We can form words that fit the pattern and include W at position 1 or 4, and the other positions from the remaining letters.

But note: we have excluded many letters, so the possibilities are limited.

Let's list possible words:

First, if W is at position 1: W O _ _ Y
Then the third and fourth positions must be filled with two letters from: B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.

But we need to form a valid English word.

Possible words:
- ""woofy"": W O O F Y -> but O is already at position 2? And we are putting O at position 3? But we don't know if O is duplicated? Also, we have excluded many letters? But F is allowed? However, ""woofy"" has two O's? And we are putting O at position 3? But we don't know if the word has two O's? The feedback for ""moist"" and ""dough"" only showed one O? But it could have two? However, in ""jowly"", we didn't have an O at position 3? But we didn't test for O at position 3? Actually, we have only seen O at position 2. So it's possible? But let's check: ""woofy"" is a word? Meaning: having a texture of wool? Or like a dog? Not common. But valid? We'll consider.

  But note: we have to use the remaining letters? F is allowed? So ""woofy"": W(1), O(2), O(3), F(4), Y(5) -> but we are putting O at position 3? And we already know O at position 2? So if the word has two O's, then in ""jowly"", we didn't have an O at position 3? But we didn't test O at position 3? So it's possible? But the feedback for ""jowly"" didn't show an O? Because we didn't put O in the guess? We put J, O, W, L, Y -> so O was at position 2 and correct, and we didn't put O elsewhere? So we don't know about other O's? So ""woofy"" is a candidate? But we are using O again? And we don't know if it's allowed? Actually, we are not excluding O? But we know O is in the word? So we can use it? But we are trying to find the word? So we can.

  However, we are using two O's? But the secret word might have only one O? Then we would get feedback that one O is correct and the other is not? But we are not sure? So it's risky? We have only 2 guesses left? (since we are on guess 5, and we have 6 tries total? We started with 1: crane, 2: moist, 3: dough, 4: jowly, so this is guess 5, and we have one more after if needed? But we want to solve in 5?).

  Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates? So we can look for words without duplicate O? 

  But in ""woofy"", we are using O at position 3? So if the secret word has only one O (at position 2), then the O at position 3 would be marked as absent? But we don't know? So we might get confused? 

  So let's avoid using O again? We are not forced to? We can use only the remaining letters and W? 

  So for W at position 1: W O [3] [4] Y -> positions 3 and 4 must be filled with two letters from B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z (and not O? because we are avoiding duplicate O? and we don't know if it's duplicated? but to be safe, we avoid?).

  What words? 
    - ""woopy"": W O O P Y -> again O at position 3? same issue? and P? but ""woopy"" is not a word? 
    - ""wooly"": W O O L Y -> but L is excluded? from guess4: L was marked x -> excluded. So no.
    - ""woofy"": as above? 
    - ""woply"": not a word.

  Actually, I can't think of a word with W at position 1 and no duplicate O? 

  Now, if W is at position 4: then the word is [1] O [3] W Y

  Then we need to fill position 1 and 3 with letters from B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.

  Possible words:
    - ""bowwy"": B O W W Y -> duplicate W? and we don't know? Also, ""bowwy"" not a word.
    - ""powwy"": not a word.
    - ""vowly"": V O W L Y -> but L excluded? no.
    - ""fowcy"": not a word.
    - ""kowly"": K O W L Y -> L excluded? no.
    - ""powny"": P O W N Y -> N excluded? from guess1 -> excluded. no.
    - ""boxwy"": B O X W Y -> valid? ""boxwy"" is not a word? 
    - ""foxwy"": not a word.

  How about ""pocky"": P O C K Y -> C excluded? no.

  I'm struggling. 

  Another idea: what if the word has W at position 1 and we use other letters? 

  We have to use the remaining letters: B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.

  For W at position 1: W O [3] [4] Y

  We need a word: W O ? ? Y

  Let me search for words: 
    - ""wooly"": excluded because L is excluded? and also has O at position 3? 
    - ""woofy"": W O O F Y -> F is allowed? and we are using O at position 3? 
    - ""woopy"": not a word? 
    - ""woxly"": not a word? 
    - ""wozzy"": W O Z Z Y -> Z is allowed? and ""wozzy"" is not a word? 

  But ""woozy"": W O O Z Y -> but we have two O's? and Z? ""woozy"" is a word? Meaning: dizzy. Yes! 

  So ""woozy"": W(1), O(2), O(3), Z(4), Y(5) -> but we are using O at position 3? 

  Now, we don't know if the secret word has two O's? But we haven't tested for O at position 3? So it's possible? 

  Also, we have Z? which is allowed? 

  So ""woozy"" is a candidate? 

  But we have to consider: if the secret word is ""woozy"", then the feedback for ""jowly"" would have been: 
      J (x), O (✓), W (?) -> but W was marked as (-) meaning present but wrong position? 
      In ""jowly"", W is at position 3? 
      In ""woozy"", W is at position 1? So that matches: W is present but not at position 3? 
      Also, L (x) and Y (✓) -> correct? 

  So ""woozy"" is consistent? 

  But we have to check if it uses only allowed letters? 
      W, O, O, Z, Y -> O is allowed? We know it's in the word? Z is not excluded? Y is allowed? 
      But we are using O twice? And we don't know if the word has two O's? 

  Alternatively, we can consider if W is at position 4? 

  What words have W at position 4? [1] O [3] W Y

  We need a word: ? O ? W Y

  With the remaining letters for positions 1 and 3: B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z.

  Possibilities:
    - ""bowwy"": not a word? 
    - ""powwy"": not a word?
    - ""fowpy"": not a word?
    - ""vowpy"": not a word?
    - ""kowwy"": not a word?
    - ""poway"": P O W A Y -> A excluded? no.
    - ""boxwy"": not a word.

  I can't find a word? 

  What about ""pobby""? P O B B Y -> but no W? But we know W must be in the word? So we must include W? 

  So if W is at position 4, then the word must have W at 4? 

  But we can't find a word? 

  Another possibility: ""bawdy"": B A W D Y -> A and D excluded? no.

  So it seems the only candidate is ""woozy""? 

  But let's check if there are other words? 

  What about ""jowly"" feedback: we have W marked as present but wrong position? So W is not at 3? 

  In ""woozy"", W is at 1? So that's a different position? So it matches? 

  Also, we have to make sure we haven't excluded any letter in ""woozy"": 
      W: not excluded? 
      O: not excluded? 
      Z: not excluded? 
      Y: not excluded? 

  And the pattern: W O O Z Y -> positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:O, 4:Z, 5:Y? But we know the fifth letter is Y? And second is O? So that matches? 

  But we are using O at position 3? We don't know if that is correct? 

  Alternatively, is there a word with W at position 1 and no duplicate O? 

  For example, ""woofy"": W O O F Y -> same issue? 

  Or ""woozy"" is the only common word? 

  Another word: ""wormy"": W O R M Y -> R and M excluded? no.

  ""wonty"": W O N T Y -> N and T excluded? no.

  So I think ""woozy"" is the best candidate? 

  But we have to consider: what if the word has W at position 4? 

  We thought of ""howdy""? But H excluded? 

  ""lowly"": L excluded? 

  ""bowly"": B O W L Y -> L excluded? 

  ""poway"": not a word? 

  ""vozhd"": not English? 

  So I think ""woozy"" is the only common word that fits? 

  Therefore, we guess ""woozy"".

  But note: we have only 2 guesses left? We are on guess 5? And we have 6 tries? So if we are wrong, we have one more? 

  Alternatively, we can try to test without committing to the duplicate O? But we don't have many options? 

  Another candidate: ""boxwy"" is not a word? 

  So we go with ""woozy"".

  Format: <guess>woozy</guess>

  But let's double-check the feedback for ""jowly"": 
      We had: J(x) O(✓) W(-) L(x) Y(✓)
      For ""woozy"": 
        - J is not in -> correct.
        - O at position 2 -> correct.
        - W is in the word but not at position 3 -> in ""woozy"", W is at position 1 -> so it should be marked as present but wrong position? Correct.
        - L is not in -> correct.
        - Y at position 5 -> correct.

  So consistent.

  And for ""dough"": D,U,G,H not in -> consistent.

  And for ""moist"": O correct, others not -> consistent.

  And for ""crane"": all not -> consistent.

  So ""woozy"" is a valid candidate.

  We'll guess ""woozy"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent → Excluded.  
- **Guess 2 (moist)**:  
  - O correct and in position 2 (✓).  
  - M, I, S, T absent (x) → Excluded.  
- **Guess 3 (dough)**:  
  - O confirmed in position 2 (✓).  
  - D, U, G, H absent (x) → Excluded.  
- **Guess 4 (jowly)**:  
  - J absent (x) → Excluded.  
  - O confirmed in position 2 (✓).  
  - W present but wrong position (-) → **W is in the word, not at position 3**.  
  - L absent (x) → Excluded.  
  - Y correct and in position 5 (✓) → **Fifth letter is Y**.  

**Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, T, D, U, G, H, J, L  
**Known Positions**:  
- Position 2: **O**  
- Position 5: **Y**  
**Present Letter (Wrong Position)**:  
- **W** (not at position 3)  

**Secret Word Pattern**: `_ O _ _ Y`  
- W must be at position 1 or 4 (since positions 2, 3, and 5 are occupied or invalid for W).  
- Remaining allowed letters: B, F, K, P, Q, V, X, Z (and W, which is already confirmed present).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The only word fitting the constraints is **""woozy""**:  
  - `W` at position 1 (tests W in a new position).  
  - `O` at position 2 (confirmed).  
  - `O` at position 3 (plausible, as duplicates haven't been ruled out).  
  - `Z` at position 4 (new letter).  
  - `Y` at position 5 (confirmed).  
- ""Woozy"" (meaning dizzy) uses allowed letters and aligns with feedback:  
  - W is present but not at position 3 (fits position 1).  
  - Tests Z, a high-value remaining consonant.  
- If correct, this solves the puzzle. If not, the feedback will confirm/deny the duplicate O and Z's status.",Guess 5: woozy -> FEEDBACK: W(✓) O(✓) O(✓) Z(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
