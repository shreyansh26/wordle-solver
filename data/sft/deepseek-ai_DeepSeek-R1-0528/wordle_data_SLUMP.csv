We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes the information we get.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
 A good starting word might be one that has unique letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.

 One of the popular starting words is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Another one is ""RAISE"". Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 So, for the first guess, I will use: RAISE

We are starting the game and need to make the first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. Ideally, the word should:
- Include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
- Have all unique letters to cover more ground
- Common starting words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"" are solid choices

We are given feedback on our first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  I: x (not in the word)
  S: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters R, A, I, E are definitely not in the secret word.
- The letter S is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed RAISE and S was at position 4, but the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains S (which we know must be in a position other than 4) and does not contain R, A, I, E.
- Remaining letters are unknown.

Since we know S is in the word but not at position 4, and we have eliminated many vowels (A, I, E) and one consonant (R), we should look for a word that includes S and uses other common consonants and the remaining vowel (O, U, sometimes Y) or other vowels? But note: we also have the possibility of other consonants.

We have eliminated: R, A, I, E. So available letters are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and S (which we know is present).

We should also avoid using A, I, E, R in the new guess.

Since S is present but not at position 4, we need to try S in a different position. Also, we have 5 positions and only one known letter (S) so far.

Our goal is to form a valid English word that:
1. Contains S (because we know S is in the word)
2. Does not contain R, A, I, E (since they were marked absent)
3. Places S in any of the other four positions (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5) because in our first guess it was at position 4 and was wrong.

But note: we don't know which position S is in, so we can try a word that puts S in a different position to narrow down.

Moreover, because we have eliminated some common vowels, we might use the remaining vowels: O, U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now).

A good strategy is to pick a word that uses other common letters we haven't tried yet (like T, N, O, L) and also includes S.

Let's see some candidate words:

- We can put S at the beginning: e.g., ""S"" at position 1.
- Or at position 2, 3, or 5.

Common words with S:

We have to avoid the absent letters: R, A, I, E.

So, words that might work:

- Position 1: S? e.g., ""STOMP"" -> but O is allowed? Let me think: we haven't tested O or U. Also, avoid E? Yes. ""STOMP"": S (position 1), T, O, M, P. This word doesn't use any of the absent letters. And S is at position 1 so that might help.

But we must note that in the feedback for RAISE, S was marked as present but wrong position (and it was at position 4). So if we put S at position 1 and it's not there, then we are testing that.

Alternatively, we might consider words that put S at position 2, 3, or 5.

Another idea: since we know S is in the word and we have eliminated four letters, we can try to use S and another set of common letters.

Possible words:

- Words with S at position 1: ""SONIC"" -> but contains I? I is eliminated. So avoid.
  Instead, without I: ""SONGY"" -> but Y? Might be invalid. How about ""SONLY""? Invalid. So avoid I and E.

- ""SCOWL"": S, C, O, W, L -> all letters not eliminated: R,A,I,E are absent? We have S at position 1 and the rest are new. But O and L are common.

- ""SHOWN"": S, H, O, W, N -> valid, uses S at position 1.

But note: we haven't tested O, U, etc. We definitely want to use vowels? Not necessarily, because the word might have O or U.

Alternatively, to get more information, we can try a word that uses S and other common consonants and vowels that are still possible.

What are common letters for 5-letter words? T, N, S (we know), L, O, U.

Since S can't be at position 4, we try it at position 1? Or position 5? But note: if we try position 1 and get x, then we know S is not at position 1. Similarly for other positions.

But we have limited guesses (only 6 total), so we want a word that might cover multiple possibilities.

Let me brainstorm:

- ""TOUCH"" -> but doesn't include S, which we know must be present? Actually, we know S is present so we must include it? Otherwise, we won't get info on S's position. So we must include S.

Therefore, we require the word to have S.

Some candidates:

- S at position 1: ""S"" + other letters (not R,A,I,E). Examples:
  ""STOMP"" -> S, T, O, M, P -> valid word.
  ""SHOWN"" -> S, H, O, W, N -> valid.
  ""SCOLD"" -> S, C, O, L, D -> valid.

- S at position 2: for example, ""USUAL"" -> but has U and A? A is eliminated -> not allowed. Also, avoids eliminated letters? We have U, S, U, A, L -> but A is eliminated -> invalid. We must not use A, I, E, R.

How about ""PSYCH"" -> not a word? It is ""PSYCH"" for psychology? Not 5 letters? Actually, we need 5-letter words. Psych isn't 5. Let's avoid.

Another: ""OSCAR"" -> O, S, C, A, R -> but A and R are eliminated -> not allowed.

So position 2: try words without A,I,E,R. For example: ""USTED""? Not English. Or ""MUSKY"": M, U, S, K, Y -> valid word. S at position 3? Let me check: M (1), U (2), S (3), K (4), Y (5). So S at position 3.

But then we are testing S in position 3. Similarly, we might test S at position 5: e.g., words ending with S.

Words ending with S: we cannot use A,I,E,R? So words like ""PLOTS"": P, L, O, T, S -> valid: S at position 5.

But note: we don't know the position of S. We have to try one.

Given we have to choose, I'll pick a word that uses S and a mix of common consonants and a vowel (O or U) to maximize the chance of hitting other letters.

Option 1: ""STOMP"" - S at start, and common letters T, O, M, P.

Option 2: ""PLUSH"" - P, L, U, S, H -> S at position 4, but we already know S is not at position 4? Because in RAISE it was at position 4 and was marked as present but wrong position? So actually, position 4 is wrong for S? That means position 4 is definitely not the place for S? So we must avoid putting S at position 4 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback won't say ""correct"" unless it's the right position. But if we put S at position 4 again, and if it is indeed not position 4, we will get a '-' again? That would be redundant? Or worse, we get a '-' but we already know? Not very informative.

So avoiding position 4 for S.

Thus, possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Now, which one to try? We don't know. We can choose arbitrarily.

But I'll choose a word that also includes other common letters we haven't tried: T, O, L, N, etc.

I'll go with ""STOMP"" because:
- It has S at position 1 (testing a new position)
- It includes T, O, M, P which are common and we haven't tried.
- It doesn't use any eliminated letters.

Alternatively, ""SONGS"" -> but S appears twice? That might be an issue because we don't know if the word has repeated S? But the feedback system doesn't specify so we assume each letter is considered independently? However, if a letter appears twice and in the word once, how would the feedback be? Typically, in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters in the guess and the word has one, the first occurrence might get '-' or 'x'? But actually, let's think: our feedback from ""RAISE"" didn't have duplicates so it's okay.

But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate S? So it's safe to use a word with duplicate? However, since we only know that at least one S is present, having another S might be redundant? And we have limited guesses? So better to use unique letters? But if we use STOMP: S, T, O, M, P -> all unique.

Similarly, ""SHOWN"": S, H, O, W, N -> unique.

I'll pick ""STOMP"". But note: the word ""STOMP"" ends with P, which is less common? Well, for information, we'll do.

Another candidate: ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H -> but we avoid T? Actually, T is okay. And it's valid.

""SLOTH"" vs ""STOMP"": both are good.

I have no strong preference. Let me choose ""STOMP"" arbitrarily.

Therefore, our next guess: STOMP

But wait: let me confirm: we are to output the word. I think STOMP is fine.

Alternatively, we might use a word that ends with S: e.g., ""FOCUS"": F, O, C, U, S -> but U is a vowel? And valid. But that puts S at position 5. Also, avoids A,I,E,R.

Another idea: ""TOWNS"": T, O, W, N, S -> S at position 5.

But again, similar.

I'll go with ""STOMP"".

So:

<thinking>
Feedback from first guess: R, A, I, E are absent; S is present but not in position 4.

Therefore, for the next guess, we choose a word that includes S (since we know it's in the word) and avoids R,A,I,E. We place S in a position that isn't 4 (to avoid redundancy) and choose other letters that are common and untested (like T, O, M, P).

We choose ""STOMP"" as the second guess.
</thinking>

<guess>STOMP</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, E are **absent** from the secret word.
- S is **present** but not in position 4.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Includes S (in position 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Excludes R, A, I, E.
- Contains 4 unknown letters (since S is one of the five).

For the second guess:
- Must include S (to test its correct position).
- Must avoid R, A, I, E.
- Should place S in a new position (not 4) to gather new information.
- Should test new common consonants (like T, M, P) and vowels (O, U) to maximize coverage.

""STOMP"" was chosen because:
- It includes S in position 1 (testing a new location).
- It uses untested common letters: T, O, M, P.
- All letters are unique and valid.

<thinking>
Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Eliminated letters: R, A, I, E → unavailable for guesses.
2. Known present letter: S → must be included.
3. Positional clue: S ≠ position 4 → try S in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
4. Goal: Maximize letter coverage → use high-frequency consonants (T, N, L) and vowels (O, U). Here, T, O, M, P are selected.
5. ""STOMP"" satisfies these conditions and is a valid English word.
</thinking>

<guess>STOMP</guess>",STOMP,"We are given feedback on our first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  I: x (not in the word)
  S: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters R, A, I, E are definitely not in the secret word.
- The letter S is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed RAISE and S was at position 4, but the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains S (which we know must be in a position other than 4) and does not contain R, A, I, E.
- Remaining letters are unknown.

So position 2: try words without A,I,E,R. For example: ""USTED""? Not English. Or ""MUSKY"": M, U, S, K, Y -> valid word. S at position 3? Let me check: M (1), U (2), S (3), K (4), Y (5). So S at position 3.

But then we are testing S in position 3. Similarly, we might test S at position 5: e.g., words ending with S.

Words ending with S: we cannot use A,I,E,R? So words like ""PLOTS"": P, L, O, T, S -> valid: S at position 5.

Given we have to choose, I'll pick a word that uses S and a mix of common consonants and a vowel (O or U) to maximize the chance of hitting other letters.

But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate S? So it's safe to use a word with duplicate? However, since we only know that at least one S is present, having another S might be redundant? And we have limited guesses? So better to use unique letters? But if we use STOMP: S, T, O, M, P -> all unique.

Similarly, ""SHOWN"": S, H, O, W, N -> unique.

I'll pick ""STOMP"". But note: the word ""STOMP"" ends with P, which is less common? Well, for information, we'll do.

Another candidate: ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H -> but we avoid T? Actually, T is okay. And it's valid.

""SLOTH"" vs ""STOMP"": both are good.

I have no strong preference. Let me choose ""STOMP"" arbitrarily.

Therefore, our next guess: STOMP

But wait: let me confirm: we are to output the word. I think STOMP is fine.

Alternatively, we might use a word that ends with S: e.g., ""FOCUS"": F, O, C, U, S -> but U is a vowel? And valid. But that puts S at position 5. Also, avoids A,I,E,R.

Another idea: ""TOWNS"": T, O, W, N, S -> S at position 5.

But again, similar.

I'll go with ""STOMP"".

So:

<thinking>
Feedback from first guess: R, A, I, E are absent; S is present but not in position 4.

Therefore, for the next guess, we choose a word that includes S (since we know it's in the word) and avoids R,A,I,E. We place S in a position that isn't 4 (to avoid redundancy) and choose other letters that are common and untested (like T, O, M, P).

We choose ""STOMP"" as the second guess.
</thinking>

<guess>STOMP</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, E are **absent** from the secret word.
- S is **present** but not in position 4.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Includes S (in position 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Excludes R, A, I, E.
- Contains 4 unknown letters (since S is one of the five).

For the second guess:
- Must include S (to test its correct position).
- Must avoid R, A, I, E.
- Should place S in a new position (not 4) to gather new information.
- Should test new common consonants (like T, M, P) and vowels (O, U) to maximize coverage.

""STOMP"" was chosen because:
- It includes S in position 1 (testing a new location).
- It uses untested common letters: T, O, M, P.
- All letters are unique and valid.

<thinking>
Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Eliminated letters: R, A, I, E → unavailable for guesses.
2. Known present letter: S → must be included.
3. Positional clue: S ≠ position 4 → try S in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
4. Goal: Maximize letter coverage → use high-frequency consonants (T, N, L) and vowels (O, U). Here, T, O, M, P are selected.
5. ""STOMP"" satisfies these conditions and is a valid English word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes the information we get.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
 A good starting word might be one that has unique letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.

 One of the popular starting words is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Another one is ""RAISE"". Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 So, for the first guess, I will use: RAISE<thinking>
We are starting the game and need to make the first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. Ideally, the word should:
- Include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
- Have all unique letters to cover more ground
- Common starting words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"" are solid choices

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as my first guess because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique, giving us feedback on five distinct characters
- It's a valid English word recognized in word games
</thinking>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  I: x (not in the word)
  S: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters R, A, I, E are definitely not in the secret word.
- The letter S is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed RAISE and S was at position 4, but the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains S (which we know must be in a position other than 4) and does not contain R, A, I, E.
- Remaining letters are unknown.

Since we know S is in the word but not at position 4, and we have eliminated many vowels (A, I, E) and one consonant (R), we should look for a word that includes S and uses other common consonants and the remaining vowel (O, U, sometimes Y) or other vowels? But note: we also have the possibility of other consonants.

We have eliminated: R, A, I, E. So available letters are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and S (which we know is present).

We should also avoid using A, I, E, R in the new guess.

Since S is present but not at position 4, we need to try S in a different position. Also, we have 5 positions and only one known letter (S) so far.

Our goal is to form a valid English word that:
1. Contains S (because we know S is in the word)
2. Does not contain R, A, I, E (since they were marked absent)
3. Places S in any of the other four positions (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5) because in our first guess it was at position 4 and was wrong.

But note: we don't know which position S is in, so we can try a word that puts S in a different position to narrow down.

Moreover, because we have eliminated some common vowels, we might use the remaining vowels: O, U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now).

A good strategy is to pick a word that uses other common letters we haven't tried yet (like T, N, O, L) and also includes S.

Let's see some candidate words:

- We can put S at the beginning: e.g., ""S"" at position 1.
- Or at position 2, 3, or 5.

Common words with S:

We have to avoid the absent letters: R, A, I, E.

So, words that might work:

- Position 1: S? e.g., ""STOMP"" -> but O is allowed? Let me think: we haven't tested O or U. Also, avoid E? Yes. ""STOMP"": S (position 1), T, O, M, P. This word doesn't use any of the absent letters. And S is at position 1 so that might help.

But we must note that in the feedback for RAISE, S was marked as present but wrong position (and it was at position 4). So if we put S at position 1 and it's not there, then we are testing that.

Alternatively, we might consider words that put S at position 2, 3, or 5.

Another idea: since we know S is in the word and we have eliminated four letters, we can try to use S and another set of common letters.

Possible words:

- Words with S at position 1: ""SONIC"" -> but contains I? I is eliminated. So avoid.
  Instead, without I: ""SONGY"" -> but Y? Might be invalid. How about ""SONLY""? Invalid. So avoid I and E.

- ""SCOWL"": S, C, O, W, L -> all letters not eliminated: R,A,I,E are absent? We have S at position 1 and the rest are new. But O and L are common.

- ""SHOWN"": S, H, O, W, N -> valid, uses S at position 1.

But note: we haven't tested O, U, etc. We definitely want to use vowels? Not necessarily, because the word might have O or U.

Alternatively, to get more information, we can try a word that uses S and other common consonants and vowels that are still possible.

What are common letters for 5-letter words? T, N, S (we know), L, O, U.

Since S can't be at position 4, we try it at position 1? Or position 5? But note: if we try position 1 and get x, then we know S is not at position 1. Similarly for other positions.

But we have limited guesses (only 6 total), so we want a word that might cover multiple possibilities.

Let me brainstorm:

- ""TOUCH"" -> but doesn't include S, which we know must be present? Actually, we know S is present so we must include it? Otherwise, we won't get info on S's position. So we must include S.

Therefore, we require the word to have S.

Some candidates:

- S at position 1: ""S"" + other letters (not R,A,I,E). Examples:
  ""STOMP"" -> S, T, O, M, P -> valid word.
  ""SHOWN"" -> S, H, O, W, N -> valid.
  ""SCOLD"" -> S, C, O, L, D -> valid.

- S at position 2: for example, ""USUAL"" -> but has U and A? A is eliminated -> not allowed. Also, avoids eliminated letters? We have U, S, U, A, L -> but A is eliminated -> invalid. We must not use A, I, E, R.

How about ""PSYCH"" -> not a word? It is ""PSYCH"" for psychology? Not 5 letters? Actually, we need 5-letter words. Psych isn't 5. Let's avoid.

Another: ""OSCAR"" -> O, S, C, A, R -> but A and R are eliminated -> not allowed.

So position 2: try words without A,I,E,R. For example: ""USTED""? Not English. Or ""MUSKY"": M, U, S, K, Y -> valid word. S at position 3? Let me check: M (1), U (2), S (3), K (4), Y (5). So S at position 3.

But then we are testing S in position 3. Similarly, we might test S at position 5: e.g., words ending with S.

Words ending with S: we cannot use A,I,E,R? So words like ""PLOTS"": P, L, O, T, S -> valid: S at position 5.

But note: we don't know the position of S. We have to try one.

Given we have to choose, I'll pick a word that uses S and a mix of common consonants and a vowel (O or U) to maximize the chance of hitting other letters.

Option 1: ""STOMP"" - S at start, and common letters T, O, M, P.

Option 2: ""PLUSH"" - P, L, U, S, H -> S at position 4, but we already know S is not at position 4? Because in RAISE it was at position 4 and was marked as present but wrong position? So actually, position 4 is wrong for S? That means position 4 is definitely not the place for S? So we must avoid putting S at position 4 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback won't say ""correct"" unless it's the right position. But if we put S at position 4 again, and if it is indeed not position 4, we will get a '-' again? That would be redundant? Or worse, we get a '-' but we already know? Not very informative.

So avoiding position 4 for S.

Thus, possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Now, which one to try? We don't know. We can choose arbitrarily.

But I'll choose a word that also includes other common letters we haven't tried: T, O, L, N, etc.

I'll go with ""STOMP"" because:
- It has S at position 1 (testing a new position)
- It includes T, O, M, P which are common and we haven't tried.
- It doesn't use any eliminated letters.

Alternatively, ""SONGS"" -> but S appears twice? That might be an issue because we don't know if the word has repeated S? But the feedback system doesn't specify so we assume each letter is considered independently? However, if a letter appears twice and in the word once, how would the feedback be? Typically, in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters in the guess and the word has one, the first occurrence might get '-' or 'x'? But actually, let's think: our feedback from ""RAISE"" didn't have duplicates so it's okay.

But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate S? So it's safe to use a word with duplicate? However, since we only know that at least one S is present, having another S might be redundant? And we have limited guesses? So better to use unique letters? But if we use STOMP: S, T, O, M, P -> all unique.

Similarly, ""SHOWN"": S, H, O, W, N -> unique.

I'll pick ""STOMP"". But note: the word ""STOMP"" ends with P, which is less common? Well, for information, we'll do.

Another candidate: ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H -> but we avoid T? Actually, T is okay. And it's valid.

""SLOTH"" vs ""STOMP"": both are good.

I have no strong preference. Let me choose ""STOMP"" arbitrarily.

Therefore, our next guess: STOMP

But wait: let me confirm: we are to output the word. I think STOMP is fine.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: absent (x)
- A: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- S: present but wrong position (-)
- E: absent (x)

So, from Guess 1, we know:
- The secret word contains S, but not in the 4th position.
- The letters R, A, I, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: STOMP
- S: correct position (✓) -> so S is in the first position? But wait, in RAISE, S was in the 4th position and was marked as present but wrong position. Now in STOMP, S is in the first position and marked as correct? That would mean the secret word has S in the first position? But let's check the feedback: S(✓) for STOMP.

But note: in RAISE, S was at position 4 and we got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not at position 4. Now in STOMP, S is at position 1 and we got a '✓', meaning it is in the correct position. So the secret word has S at position 1.

Also, for STOMP:
- T: absent (x) -> so T is not in the word
- O: absent (x) -> O is not in the word
- M: correct position (✓) -> M is in the word and at position 4? STOMP: positions: 1-S, 2-T, 3-O, 4-M, 5-P. So M is at position 4 and is correct? But wait, the feedback says M(✓) meaning correct position? So M is at position 4.
- P: correct position (✓) -> P is at position 5 and correct.

So, from Guess 2:
- S is at position 1 (correct)
- T is absent (not in the word)
- O is absent (not in the word)
- M is at position 4 (correct)
- P is at position 5 (correct)

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 1: S
- Position 4: M
- Position 5: P
- And the word does not contain T, O, and also from guess 1, does not contain R, A, I, E.

Now, we are missing position 2 and position 3.

So the word is: S _ _ M P

We know the letters that are absent: R, A, I, E, T, O.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with S, ends with MP, and the third and fourth letters are missing? Wait, position 4 is M and position 5 is P, so the last two are MP.

The word is: S _ _ M P

We need to fill in the two middle letters (positions 2 and 3) with letters that are not in the absent list: R, A, I, E, T, O.

Also, we must consider that the word must be a valid English word.

What letters are possible? We have the entire alphabet minus the absent ones: R, A, I, E, T, O.

So available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: M and P are already in the word? We don't know if they can be repeated? The feedback doesn't show any duplicate, so we don't know. But we should avoid repeating unless necessary? Actually, we have M and P already placed, so if we use them again, it might be redundant? But the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

However, since we have M and P already in the word, and we are only missing two letters, we can try to use new letters to get more information? But we are at guess 3, and we have 3 positions known? Actually, we have 3 positions fixed: S at 1, M at 4, P at 5. Only positions 2 and 3 are unknown.

But we have two letters to guess. And we have many letters available.

But we don't have any information about positions 2 and 3. So we need to guess a word that fits the pattern and uses letters that are possible.

Moreover, we want to maximize information? But at this point, we can try to guess the word directly? Because we have a lot of constraints.

Let's list possible words that start with S, end with MP, and are 5 letters.

Common words: 
- STAMP? But T is absent and A is absent? STAMP: S, T, A, M, P -> but T and A are absent? So invalid.
- SKIMP: S, K, I, M, P -> but I is absent? From guess 1, I is absent? So invalid.
- SLUMP: S, L, U, M, P -> L and U are not in the absent list? So possible? 
- SCAMP: S, C, A, M, P -> A is absent? Invalid.
- SWAMP: S, W, A, M, P -> A absent? Invalid.
- CRUMP? But starts with C, not S? We need S at start.
- CLAMP? Again, not starting with S.

So, SLUMP: S, L, U, M, P -> positions: 1-S, 2-L, 3-U, 4-M, 5-P. This seems possible? But we have M at position 4 and P at 5, so yes.

Another: STUMP? S, T, U, M, P -> but T is absent? From guess 2, T is absent? So invalid.

Another: SCUMP? Not a word.

SHIMP? Not a word.

SLIMP? Not a word.

SWIMP? Not a word.

SNUMP? Not a word.

So, SLUMP is a word? Yes, meaning to fall or sink heavily.

Also, ""STOMP"" we already used? But that's not the pattern.

Another word: ""SCRUM"" is 5 letters? S, C, R, U, M -> but R is absent? And it ends with M, not MP? No, we need MP at the end.

We need the last two to be M and P, so the word must end with ""MP"".

Other possibilities: 
- ""CLUMP"": but starts with C, not S.
- ""PLUMP"": starts with P, not S.

So, back to SLUMP: S, L, U, M, P -> and L and U are not in the absent list? So it's a candidate.

But is there another? ""SKUMP""? Not a word.

""SPUMP""? Not a word.

""SLAMP""? Not a word.

""SWUMP""? Not a word.

""SLUMP"" seems to be the only common word? But let me think: what about ""STUMP""? But T is absent.

Another: ""SCUMP"" is not a word.

""SHLMP""? No.

Perhaps ""SLUMP"" is the only one? But we have to consider other letters.

What about ""SNAMP""? Not a word.

""SLIMP"" is not a word.

But note: we have M at position 4 and P at 5, so the third letter must be the one before M? So the word is S _ X M P, where X is the third letter.

In SLUMP, X is U.

But are there other words? For example, ""SCRIMP""? But that has R and I? R and I are absent? SCRIMP: S, C, R, I, M, P? Wait, that's 6 letters? No, SCRIMP is 6? Actually, ""scrimp"" is 6 letters? Let me check: S-C-R-I-M-P, that's 6? No, positions: 1-S, 2-C, 3-R, 4-I, 5-M? But then P? It's 5 letters? S-C-R-I-M-P? That's 6 characters. ""Scrimp"" is 6 letters? Actually, no: scrimp is 6 letters: S-C-R-I-M-P? Count: 1-S, 2-C, 3-R, 4-I, 5-M, 6-P? But we need 5 letters. So invalid.

""Scamp"" is 5: S-C-A-M-P, but A is absent.

""Skimp"" is 5: S-K-I-M-P, I absent.

So, back to ""SLUMP"": S-L-U-M-P, 5 letters.

Another possibility: ""STAMP"" is out because of T and A.

""SWOMP""? Not a word.

""SLUMP"" seems to be the only common word? But what about ""SPUMP""? Not a word.

Or ""SLAMP""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""SLUMP"" is the word? But we have to guess.

But note: we have two positions to fill, and we can try to guess SLUMP.

But let me confirm the feedback: if the word is SLUMP, then:

In guess 1: RAISE -> S is present but not at position 4? In RAISE, S is at position 4, but in SLUMP, S is at position 1, so that matches the '-' for S in RAISE? Actually, in RAISE, S was marked as present but wrong position, which is correct because it's at position 1 in the secret word, not 4.

In guess 2: STOMP -> we have S at 1 correct, T absent (which is good because SLUMP has no T), O absent (good, no O), M at 4 correct, P at 5 correct. So that matches.

So SLUMP should be the word? But we are not sure? There might be other words.

Another word: ""SHULM""? Not a word.

""SLUMP"" is the only common word I can think of.

But what about ""SCUMP""? Not a word.

Or ""SLURP""? But SLURP: S-L-U-R-P -> but R is absent? From guess 1, R is absent? So invalid.

""SLUMP"" is the only one.

But let me think of words ending with MP: champ, clamp, cramp, crimp, dump, etc. But with S at start? Only slump and stamp? Stamp has T and A which are absent.

So I think SLUMP is the word.

Therefore, we can guess SLUMP.

But we are to make a new guess, so I'll go with SLUMP.

But to be thorough, let's see if there are other possibilities.

What about ""SWAMP""? But A is absent.

""SKIMP"" has I absent.

""SCRIMP"" is 6 letters? Or 5? S-C-R-I-M-P: that's 6 characters? No, ""scrimp"" is 5 letters? Let me count: S, C, R, I, M, P? That's 6? Actually, no: ""scrimp"" has 6 letters: s-c-r-i-m-p. But we need 5. So not.

""Primp"" is 5 but doesn't start with S.

""Clump"" doesn't start with S.

So, I think SLUMP is the only common word.

Therefore, we guess SLUMP.

But note: in the feedback for STOMP, we have M and P correct, so the word is S _ _ M P.

And SLUMP fits: S L U M P.

So, let's go with that.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback provided:

- **Guess 1: RAISE**  
  Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R, A, I, E are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - S is **present** but not in position 4 (since it was guessed there but marked as wrong position).

- **Guess 2: STOMP**  
  Feedback: S(✓), T(x), O(x), M(✓), P(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - S is **correct** at position 1.  
  - T and O are **absent** from the word.  
  - M is **correct** at position 4.  
  - P is **correct** at position 5.

### Deductions
- **Known letters and positions**:  
  - Position 1: **S** (confirmed correct).  
  - Position 4: **M** (confirmed correct).  
  - Position 5: **P** (confirmed correct).  
  - Therefore, the secret word pattern is: **S _ _ M P** (only positions 2 and 3 are unknown).

- **Absent letters**:  
  - From Guess 1: R, A, I, E.  
  - From Guess 2: T, O.  
  - **Total absent letters**: R, A, I, E, T, O.  
  - **Available letters** (not absent and not yet confirmed): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Note that S, M, and P are already placed but could potentially repeat (though unlikely based on common words).

- **Constraints for positions 2 and 3**:  
  - Must form a valid English word with the pattern **S _ _ M P**.  
  - Cannot use absent letters (R, A, I, E, T, O).  
  - Should prioritize common letters to maximize the chance of a valid word.

### Possible Words
- After eliminating absent letters, the only common English word fitting **S _ _ M P** is **SLUMP** (S-L-U-M-P).  
  - **L** and **U** are available letters (not absent).  
  - **SLUMP** is a valid 5-letter word (meaning to fall or sink heavily).  
- Other potential words (e.g., STAMP, SKIMP, SCAMP) are invalid due to absent letters (T, A, I).  
- No other common 5-letter words match the pattern with the available letters.

### Conclusion
Given the constraints, **SLUMP** is the only plausible guess. It uses the confirmed positions (S at 1, M at 4, P at 5) and fills positions 2 and 3 with untested letters (L and U) that are not absent. If correct, this will solve the puzzle. If incorrect, the feedback will provide more information for subsequent guesses.

<guess>SLUMP</guess>",SLUMP,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE

- A: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)

- The secret word contains S, but not in the 4th position.
- The letters R, A, I, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: STOMP

Also, for STOMP:
- T: absent (x) -> so T is not in the word
- O: absent (x) -> O is not in the word
- M: correct position (✓) -> M is in the word and at position 4? STOMP: positions: 1-S, 2-T, 3-O, 4-M, 5-P. So M is at position 4 and is correct? But wait, the feedback says M(✓) meaning correct position? So M is at position 4.
- P: correct position (✓) -> P is at position 5 and correct.

So, from Guess 2:
- S is at position 1 (correct)
- T is absent (not in the word)
- O is absent (not in the word)
- M is at position 4 (correct)
- P is at position 5 (correct)

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 1: S
- Position 4: M
- Position 5: P
- And the word does not contain T, O, and also from guess 1, does not contain R, A, I, E.

Now, we are missing position 2 and position 3.

So the word is: S _ _ M P

We know the letters that are absent: R, A, I, E, T, O.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with S, ends with MP, and the third and fourth letters are missing? Wait, position 4 is M and position 5 is P, so the last two are MP.

The word is: S _ _ M P

Other possibilities:

Actually, no: scrimp is 6 letters: S-C-R-I-M-P? Count: 1-S, 2-C, 3-R, 4-I, 5-M, 6-P? But we need 5 letters. So invalid.

""Scamp"" is 5: S-C-A-M-P, but A is absent.
