We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

From this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R and does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
1. Does not contain C, A, N, E.
2. Includes the letter R, but not in the second position.
3. Uses other common letters to test for other positions.

We know the secret word has R, so let's think about possible positions for R. Since it was in the second position in ""crane"" and was marked as wrong position, R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Wait, no: the feedback symbol for R is ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in the second position. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, the positions are 1-based? Let me check:

In ""crane"":
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E

So R was guessed in position 2, but it's actually in a different position. So R is present in the word, but not at index 2 (i.e., not the second letter).

We also know that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, E.

We have one known letter: R. So we need to choose a word that has R in a different position (1, 3, 4, or 5) and uses other letters that are common and not the ones we've eliminated.

Let me consider the alphabet. We've eliminated C, A, N, E. So we should use consonants and vowels that haven't been tested yet.

Common vowels: We haven't tried I, O, U. Also, common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.

We also want to maximize information by using distinct letters where possible.

Possible words that include R and avoid C, A, N, E:

Some ideas: 
- Words starting with R: but R might not be first? It could be, but we don't know. 
- Alternatively, we can put R in third position? 

Since we don't know the position, it might be good to try R in a different position than second. For example, try R in the first position? But we don't know if it's first. We need to test new positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in position 1, so we can check if R is first. If we get feedback that R is correct, then we know. Otherwise, if it's present but wrong position, then it must be in 3,4,5.

Similarly, we can try to cover more common letters.

Let me think of a word that has R and avoids the eliminated letters. Also, it must be 5 letters.

Possible word: ""ROBOT"" -> but it has O? Wait, but O hasn't been tested. Also, it has B and T? Wait, but we don't know if O is in the word? Also, ""robot"" has repeated O? That's not ideal because we want distinct letters for maximum information? But repeated letters might be there? It's acceptable if the word has repeated letters.

But for second guess, maybe try to use distinct letters? 

Another idea: ""SPRIT"" is not a word? How about ""SPORT""? Let's check:

""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T.
- This avoids C, A, N, E. Includes R in the fourth position? Positions: 1-S, 2-P, 3-O, 4-R, 5-T. So R is in position 4.

But the word has O? We don't know if O is in the word.

Alternatively, ""GRIPT"" ? Not a common word.

Better to use common words.

Another idea: ""BIRDS""? But ""birds"" has B, I, R, D, S. 
- Avoids C, A, N, E? Yes.

But we don't know if B, I, D, S are in the word.

We should try to cover multiple common consonants and vowels.

Since we know R must be in the word, we can also try to use other common letters that haven't been tested. For example, S, T, L, etc.

I think ""ROUST"" is a word? R, O, U, S, T. But we don't have a vowel? It has O and U? Actually, vowels are important.

Recall: In English, vowels are A, E, I, O, U. We have eliminated A and E already? Yes, from the first guess: A and E are not in the word. So the secret word must have vowels from among I, O, U. So we should include one of these to test.

In our guess, it would be wise to include a vowel that hasn't been tested.

So let me try to choose a word with R and one of I, O, U, and avoid A, E (and C, N, of course).

Possible words:
- ""PIOUS"": but it has A? No, P,I,O,U,S. Wait, that's 5 letters? ""PIOUS"" is a word. But does it have R? No, it doesn't. So we must include R.

So we need R and a vowel (I, O, U).

How about ""FOURS""? But that has 5 letters? F,O,U,R,S. Yes. Avoids C, A, E, N? Yes. Includes O and U? But we have two vowels? That's okay.

But the letter R is present? Yes, in position 4? So positions: F(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), S(5). So R is not in second position? It's in fourth? Then we are testing R in fourth? If the secret word has R in fourth position, we might get a ""correct"" marker? Else, if R is in first, third, fifth? Then it would be present but wrong position.

We can also consider ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S. Avoids C, A, N, E? Yes. And has R in first position? So if R is in first position, we might get correct? If not, but R is present, then it must be elsewhere? But we know R can't be in second? Actually, in this guess, R is at position 1? So if R is at position 1 in the secret word, then we get a ""correct"" marker? Else if it's present but wrong position, then we know R isn't in first? Then it must be in positions 3,4,5? But we should also consider that R might appear more than once? But for now, assume one R? We don't know.

Actually, the feedback doesn't specify if there are multiple occurrences? We have to be cautious? But in the first guess, there was only one R? So if there are multiple R, we might have gotten a - or ✓ for the matching positions? But in ""crane"", only one R? And it was marked present? So the secret word has at least one R? But we don't know if it has two? However, for simplicity, let's assume we are trying to guess a word without double letters? But it can have double? So word like ""RURAL"" would have two R? But we shouldn't assume? Better to start with a word without repeated letters for maximum information? 

But our first guess ""crane"" had distinct letters? Similarly, second guess should ideally use distinct letters? So that we can test more? 

Therefore, let me prefer words with distinct letters.

So ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S? All distinct? R, O, I, L, S? Yes? So no repeated letters.

Similarly, ""POURS"": P, O, U, R, S? Distinct letters? O and U are both vowels? But distinct? Yes. Wait, ""POURS"" has S? So letters: P, O, U, R, S? All distinct? Yes? Or ""TURBO"": T, U, R, B, O? Distinct? Also avoids forbidden letters? 

But we have to choose one. 

Another idea: ""STIRP"" is not common? How about ""SHIRT"": S, H, I, R, T? Distinct letters? Yes. Avoids C, A, N, E? Yes. Includes R? In position 4? So positions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-I, 4-R, 5-T. So R is at fourth position.

But R was previously at second? Now we are trying at fourth? That's fine? 

We can also try R at first? So let me try that? For example, ""ROBOT"" has repeated O? So distinct? Not. So ""ROAST""? But wait, R-O-A-S-T? Wait, A is forbidden? Avoid A? So we can't use words with A? Similarly, ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D? But N is forbidden? We eliminated N.

So we must avoid letters C, A, N, E? So for ""ROUND"": has R,O,U, N? N is forbidden? So no? 

Then ""ROUND"" not allowed? Because we know N isn't in the word? So any word containing C, A, N, E isn't valid? And we must guess only valid words? 

So, a word must consist of letters from the English alphabet? And not contain forbidden letters? But the forbidden letters might be in the word? But from feedback? Actually, we know they aren?t? Because the feedback had:
C: x -> not in word? Similarly, A: x -> not in word? N: x -> not in word? E: x -> not in word? And R: - -> present but wrong position? 

Actually, the red 'x' means the letter is not in the word? So the secret word does not contain C, A, N, E? 

Therefore, our next guess must not include C, A, N, E? Because those letters are not part of the secret word? 

Similarly, we are required to guess valid English words? So we must guess a word that uses letters excluding C, A, N, E? 

So we must choose a word without C, A, N, E? and include R? 

Also, we haven't tested several common letters? For example, S, T, L, D, I, O, U, etc.

So let me pick a word that has R? In a new position? Also includes vowels? We need vowels? So among I, O, U? 

Possible words: 
- ""DIRTY"": D, I, R, T, Y? Avoids bad letters? Positions: D at 1, I at 2, R at 3? So R is in third position? 
- ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T? R in fourth? 
- ""ROYST"": not common? 
- ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T? Letters distinct? Avoids C,A,N,E? And R at second position? But R was already tried at second? And it was wrong position? But now we are trying R again? We know R is in the word? So putting R at second again? Then we will get a - marker? Because it's still the wrong position? But we don't know? Unless the secret word has R at second? But that can't be? Because in guess 1, when R was at second, it was marked as wrong position? So R cannot be at second? Therefore, we must avoid putting R at second? 

Therefore, in our next guess, we should put R at a different position? Positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? 

So for example, ""RIGHT"": R, I, G, H, T? Positions: R at 1? Avoids bad letters? But has G? 
But what if the word has R at first? Then we get ✓? Else, if R is in the word but not first? Then we get ""-"" for R? That's okay? 

Another option: ""DRIPS"": D, R, I, P, S? R at position 2? But wait, position 2? We know R was at position 2 in the first guess? And it was marked as wrong position? So putting R again at position 2? That is not forbidden? Because maybe the word has multiple R? But if the secret word does not have R at second? But if we put R at second? Then we will see? If we put R at second and it was wrong in the first guess? It might still be wrong? So we might learn that R is definitely not at second? But we already know that? So it might be redundant? 

So to avoid wasting? We should try R in a new position? So positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? 

Therefore, my plan is to try R at first position? That way? If R is at first? We get ✓? If not? We get -? But we know R is in the word? So we'll see?

Also, if R is not at first? Then the feedback will show R is present? And we'll know it's not second or first? So it must be 3,4, or5? 

Therefore, let me choose a word with R in position 1? Then we will test position 1? 

So word: ""RIGHT""? R,I,G,H,T? 
But is ""RIGHT"" a valid word? Yes? 

Also, ""RISKY"": R,I,S,K,Y? Avoids bad letters? 

""ROBOT"" has repeated O? And O is untested? But not distinct? 

I think ""RIGHT"" is okay? But let me see if better options? 

Another word: ""ROTIS"": Not common? 

How about ""RUSTS""? Repeated S? Not distinct? 

Better: ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? Avoids C,A,N,E? Distinct letters? 

Or ""ROUTS"": R,O,U,T,S? Distinct? 

Yes? ""ROUTS"" is a word? Meaning forces to leave? Yes. 

""ROUTS"": R(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), S(5)? So R at first? 

Similarly, ""ROWTH""? Uncommon? 

Another common word: ""PRISM"": P,R,I,S,M? Avoids bad letters? But R is at second position? We want to avoid second position? Since we know R isn't there? So if we put R at second? Then we will certainly get - for R? But we don't learn anything new about R's position? 

So putting R in second is not informative? 

Therefore, make R at a position we haven't tried? Currently, we've only tried position 2? So we haven't tried position 1,3,4,5? 

So I'll choose a word with R at first? 

Common options: ""RIGHT"", ""ROAST"" but ROAST has A? Which is forbidden? So no. ""ROBES"" has E? Forbidden? 

So ""RIPER""? Has E? Forbidden? 

""RIDER""? Has D and E? Avoids E? ""RIDER"" has E? No? E is forbidden? So we can't use E? 

So what word with R at first? 

""RIFTS"": R,I,F,T,S? Avoids C,A,N,E? Distinct letters? 

""RIFTS"": yes? 

Similarly, ""RISKS"": R,I,S,K,S? Repeated S? Not distinct? 

I think ""RIFTS"" is good? 

Also, ""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y? Avoids bad letters? Distinct letters? 

""RUSTY"": R(1), U(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5)? Then R at first? U at second? Which is a vowel? 

Similarly, ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? 

Which is better? Since vowels are important? We haven't tested U? Or O? 

We have the opportunity to test a vowel we haven't tried? So in ""RUSTY"", we test U? Or in ""ROWTH""? 

But O is a common vowel? Similarly U? 

Both seem fine? 

I think ""RUSTY"" is a good choice? Because it also includes S,T? Which are common? 

So I'll go with ""RUSTY""?

But let me also consider the word ""PSYCH"": but it has C? And not 5 letters? 

No? 

Another idea: ""TRUTH""? But T? And R? R is at second? Position? So ""TRUTH"": T(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), H(5)? But T repeated? And R is at second? Which we know isn't the position? 

So we avoid second? 

Therefore, I think ""RUSTY""?

But wait? We know R must be present? And we put R at first? 

Alternatively, we could put R at fifth? But that's less common? 

So I'll choose ""RUSTY"". 

So second guess: ""RUSTY""

In summary: 
- R is at position 1? So we test if R is at position 1?
- U is at position 2? Which is a vowel? 
- S at position 3?
- T at position 4?
- Y at position 5? 

We'll get feedback on these letters? 

Therefore, the guessed word is ""RUSTY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is confirmed to be in the secret word but not in the second position.
- C, A, N, and E are eliminated (not in the word).

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Avoid the letters C, A, N, E.
2. Include R in a new position (not position 2) to test its location.
3. Test other common consonants and vowels (like S, T, U, Y) for maximum information.
4. Prefer distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

The word ""rusty"" fits:
- R at position 1 to test if it belongs there.
- U (an untested vowel) at position 2.
- S, T, and Y (common consonants) at positions 3, 4, and 5.
- Does not contain C, A, N, E.
- All letters are distinct.

This guess will help narrow down the position of R and test new letters efficiently.

<guess>rusty</guess>",rusty,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

From this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R and does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
1. Does not contain C, A, N, E.
2. Includes the letter R, but not in the second position.
3. Uses other common letters to test for other positions.

We know the secret word has R, so let's think about possible positions for R. Since it was in the second position in ""crane"" and was marked as wrong position, R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Wait, no: the feedback symbol for R is ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in the second position. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, the positions are 1-based? Let me check:

In ""crane"":
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E

So R was guessed in position 2, but it's actually in a different position. So R is present in the word, but not at index 2 (i.e., not the second letter).

We also know that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, E.

We have one known letter: R. So we need to choose a word that has R in a different position (1, 3, 4, or 5) and uses other letters that are common and not the ones we've eliminated.

Let me consider the alphabet. We've eliminated C, A, N, E. So we should use consonants and vowels that haven't been tested yet.

Common vowels: We haven't tried I, O, U. Also, common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.

We also want to maximize information by using distinct letters where possible.

Possible words that include R and avoid C, A, N, E:

Some ideas: 
- Words starting with R: but R might not be first? It could be, but we don't know. 
- Alternatively, we can put R in third position? 

Since we don't know the position, it might be good to try R in a different position than second. For example, try R in the first position? But we don't know if it's first. We need to test new positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in position 1, so we can check if R is first. If we get feedback that R is correct, then we know. Otherwise, if it's present but wrong position, then it must be in 3,4,5.

Similarly, we can try to cover more common letters.

Let me think of a word that has R and avoids the eliminated letters. Also, it must be 5 letters.

Possible word: ""ROBOT"" -> but it has O? Wait, but O hasn't been tested. Also, it has B and T? Wait, but we don't know if O is in the word? Also, ""robot"" has repeated O? That's not ideal because we want distinct letters for maximum information? But repeated letters might be there? It's acceptable if the word has repeated letters.

But for second guess, maybe try to use distinct letters? 

Another idea: ""SPRIT"" is not a word? How about ""SPORT""? Let's check:

""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T.
- This avoids C, A, N, E. Includes R in the fourth position? Positions: 1-S, 2-P, 3-O, 4-R, 5-T. So R is in position 4.

But the word has O? We don't know if O is in the word.

Alternatively, ""GRIPT"" ? Not a common word.

Better to use common words.

Another idea: ""BIRDS""? But ""birds"" has B, I, R, D, S. 
- Avoids C, A, N, E? Yes.

But we don't know if B, I, D, S are in the word.

We should try to cover multiple common consonants and vowels.

Since we know R must be in the word, we can also try to use other common letters that haven't been tested. For example, S, T, L, etc.

I think ""ROUST"" is a word? R, O, U, S, T. But we don't have a vowel? It has O and U? Actually, vowels are important.

Recall: In English, vowels are A, E, I, O, U. We have eliminated A and E already? Yes, from the first guess: A and E are not in the word. So the secret word must have vowels from among I, O, U. So we should include one of these to test.

In our guess, it would be wise to include a vowel that hasn't been tested.

So let me try to choose a word with R and one of I, O, U, and avoid A, E (and C, N, of course).

Possible words:
- ""PIOUS"": but it has A? No, P,I,O,U,S. Wait, that's 5 letters? ""PIOUS"" is a word. But does it have R? No, it doesn't. So we must include R.

So we need R and a vowel (I, O, U).

How about ""FOURS""? But that has 5 letters? F,O,U,R,S. Yes. Avoids C, A, E, N? Yes. Includes O and U? But we have two vowels? That's okay.

But the letter R is present? Yes, in position 4? So positions: F(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), S(5). So R is not in second position? It's in fourth? Then we are testing R in fourth? If the secret word has R in fourth position, we might get a ""correct"" marker? Else, if R is in first, third, fifth? Then it would be present but wrong position.

We can also consider ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S. Avoids C, A, N, E? Yes. And has R in first position? So if R is in first position, we might get correct? If not, but R is present, then it must be elsewhere? But we know R can't be in second? Actually, in this guess, R is at position 1? So if R is at position 1 in the secret word, then we get a ""correct"" marker? Else if it's present but wrong position, then we know R isn't in first? Then it must be in positions 3,4,5? But we should also consider that R might appear more than once? But for now, assume one R? We don't know.

Actually, the feedback doesn't specify if there are multiple occurrences? We have to be cautious? But in the first guess, there was only one R? So if there are multiple R, we might have gotten a - or ✓ for the matching positions? But in ""crane"", only one R? And it was marked present? So the secret word has at least one R? But we don't know if it has two? However, for simplicity, let's assume we are trying to guess a word without double letters? But it can have double? So word like ""RURAL"" would have two R? But we shouldn't assume? Better to start with a word without repeated letters for maximum information? 

But our first guess ""crane"" had distinct letters? Similarly, second guess should ideally use distinct letters? So that we can test more? 

Therefore, let me prefer words with distinct letters.

So ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S? All distinct? R, O, I, L, S? Yes? So no repeated letters.

Similarly, ""POURS"": P, O, U, R, S? Distinct letters? O and U are both vowels? But distinct? Yes. Wait, ""POURS"" has S? So letters: P, O, U, R, S? All distinct? Yes? Or ""TURBO"": T, U, R, B, O? Distinct? Also avoids forbidden letters? 

But we have to choose one. 

Another idea: ""STIRP"" is not common? How about ""SHIRT"": S, H, I, R, T? Distinct letters? Yes. Avoids C, A, N, E? Yes. Includes R? In position 4? So positions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-I, 4-R, 5-T. So R is at fourth position.

But R was previously at second? Now we are trying at fourth? That's fine? 

We can also try R at first? So let me try that? For example, ""ROBOT"" has repeated O? So distinct? Not. So ""ROAST""? But wait, R-O-A-S-T? Wait, A is forbidden? Avoid A? So we can't use words with A? Similarly, ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D? But N is forbidden? We eliminated N.

So we must avoid letters C, A, N, E? So for ""ROUND"": has R,O,U, N? N is forbidden? So no? 

Then ""ROUND"" not allowed? Because we know N isn't in the word? So any word containing C, A, N, E isn't valid? And we must guess only valid words? 

So, a word must consist of letters from the English alphabet? And not contain forbidden letters? But the forbidden letters might be in the word? But from feedback? Actually, we know they aren?t? Because the feedback had:
C: x -> not in word? Similarly, A: x -> not in word? N: x -> not in word? E: x -> not in word? And R: - -> present but wrong position? 

Actually, the red 'x' means the letter is not in the word? So the secret word does not contain C, A, N, E? 

Therefore, our next guess must not include C, A, N, E? Because those letters are not part of the secret word? 

Similarly, we are required to guess valid English words? So we must guess a word that uses letters excluding C, A, N, E? 

So we must choose a word without C, A, N, E? and include R? 

Also, we haven't tested several common letters? For example, S, T, L, D, I, O, U, etc.

So let me pick a word that has R? In a new position? Also includes vowels? We need vowels? So among I, O, U? 

Possible words: 
- ""DIRTY"": D, I, R, T, Y? Avoids bad letters? Positions: D at 1, I at 2, R at 3? So R is in third position? 
- ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T? R in fourth? 
- ""ROYST"": not common? 
- ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T? Letters distinct? Avoids C,A,N,E? And R at second position? But R was already tried at second? And it was wrong position? But now we are trying R again? We know R is in the word? So putting R at second again? Then we will get a - marker? Because it's still the wrong position? But we don't know? Unless the secret word has R at second? But that can't be? Because in guess 1, when R was at second, it was marked as wrong position? So R cannot be at second? Therefore, we must avoid putting R at second? 

Therefore, in our next guess, we should put R at a different position? Positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? 

So for example, ""RIGHT"": R, I, G, H, T? Positions: R at 1? Avoids bad letters? But has G? 
But what if the word has R at first? Then we get ✓? Else, if R is in the word but not first? Then we get ""-"" for R? That's okay? 

Another option: ""DRIPS"": D, R, I, P, S? R at position 2? But wait, position 2? We know R was at position 2 in the first guess? And it was marked as wrong position? So putting R again at position 2? That is not forbidden? Because maybe the word has multiple R? But if the secret word does not have R at second? But if we put R at second? Then we will see? If we put R at second and it was wrong in the first guess? It might still be wrong? So we might learn that R is definitely not at second? But we already know that? So it might be redundant? 

So to avoid wasting? We should try R in a new position? So positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? 

Therefore, my plan is to try R at first position? That way? If R is at first? We get ✓? If not? We get -? But we know R is in the word? So we'll see?

Also, if R is not at first? Then the feedback will show R is present? And we'll know it's not second or first? So it must be 3,4, or5? 

Therefore, let me choose a word with R in position 1? Then we will test position 1? 

So word: ""RIGHT""? R,I,G,H,T? 
But is ""RIGHT"" a valid word? Yes? 

Also, ""RISKY"": R,I,S,K,Y? Avoids bad letters? 

""ROBOT"" has repeated O? And O is untested? But not distinct? 

I think ""RIGHT"" is okay? But let me see if better options? 

Another word: ""ROTIS"": Not common? 

How about ""RUSTS""? Repeated S? Not distinct? 

Better: ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? Avoids C,A,N,E? Distinct letters? 

Or ""ROUTS"": R,O,U,T,S? Distinct? 

Yes? ""ROUTS"" is a word? Meaning forces to leave? Yes. 

""ROUTS"": R(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), S(5)? So R at first? 

Similarly, ""ROWTH""? Uncommon? 

Another common word: ""PRISM"": P,R,I,S,M? Avoids bad letters? But R is at second position? We want to avoid second position? Since we know R isn't there? So if we put R at second? Then we will certainly get - for R? But we don't learn anything new about R's position? 

So putting R in second is not informative? 

Therefore, make R at a position we haven't tried? Currently, we've only tried position 2? So we haven't tried position 1,3,4,5? 

So I'll choose a word with R at first? 

Common options: ""RIGHT"", ""ROAST"" but ROAST has A? Which is forbidden? So no. ""ROBES"" has E? Forbidden? 

So ""RIPER""? Has E? Forbidden? 

""RIDER""? Has D and E? Avoids E? ""RIDER"" has E? No? E is forbidden? So we can't use E? 

So what word with R at first? 

""RIFTS"": R,I,F,T,S? Avoids C,A,N,E? Distinct letters? 

""RIFTS"": yes? 

Similarly, ""RISKS"": R,I,S,K,S? Repeated S? Not distinct? 

I think ""RIFTS"" is good? 

Also, ""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y? Avoids bad letters? Distinct letters? 

""RUSTY"": R(1), U(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5)? Then R at first? U at second? Which is a vowel? 

Similarly, ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? 

Which is better? Since vowels are important? We haven't tested U? Or O? 

We have the opportunity to test a vowel we haven't tried? So in ""RUSTY"", we test U? Or in ""ROWTH""? 

But O is a common vowel? Similarly U? 

Both seem fine? 

I think ""RUSTY"" is a good choice? Because it also includes S,T? Which are common? 

So I'll go with ""RUSTY""?

But let me also consider the word ""PSYCH"": but it has C? And not 5 letters? 

No? 

Another idea: ""TRUTH""? But T? And R? R is at second? Position? So ""TRUTH"": T(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), H(5)? But T repeated? And R is at second? Which we know isn't the position? 

So we avoid second? 

Therefore, I think ""RUSTY""?

But wait? We know R must be present? And we put R at first? 

Alternatively, we could put R at fifth? But that's less common? 

So I'll choose ""RUSTY"". 

So second guess: ""RUSTY""

In summary: 
- R is at position 1? So we test if R is at position 1?
- U is at position 2? Which is a vowel? 
- S at position 3?
- T at position 4?
- Y at position 5? 

We'll get feedback on these letters? 

Therefore, the guessed word is ""RUSTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is confirmed to be in the secret word but not in the second position.
- C, A, N, and E are eliminated (not in the word).

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Avoid the letters C, A, N, E.
2. Include R in a new position (not position 2) to test its location.
3. Test other common consonants and vowels (like S, T, U, Y) for maximum information.
4. Prefer distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

The word ""rusty"" fits:
- R at position 1 to test if it belongs there.
- U (an untested vowel) at position 2.
- S, T, and Y (common consonants) at positions 3, 4, and 5.
- Does not contain C, A, N, E.
- All letters are distinct.

This guess will help narrow down the position of R and test new letters efficiently.",Guess 2: rusty -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) U(x) S(✓) T(x) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,risky,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 Let me pick ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has the letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

From this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R and does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
1. Does not contain C, A, N, E.
2. Includes the letter R, but not in the second position.
3. Uses other common letters to test for other positions.

We know the secret word has R, so let's think about possible positions for R. Since it was in the second position in ""crane"" and was marked as wrong position, R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Wait, no: the feedback symbol for R is ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in the second position. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, the positions are 1-based? Let me check:

In ""crane"":
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E

So R was guessed in position 2, but it's actually in a different position. So R is present in the word, but not at index 2 (i.e., not the second letter).

We also know that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, E.

We have one known letter: R. So we need to choose a word that has R in a different position (1, 3, 4, or 5) and uses other letters that are common and not the ones we've eliminated.

Let me consider the alphabet. We've eliminated C, A, N, E. So we should use consonants and vowels that haven't been tested yet.

Common vowels: We haven't tried I, O, U. Also, common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.

We also want to maximize information by using distinct letters where possible.

Possible words that include R and avoid C, A, N, E:

Some ideas: 
- Words starting with R: but R might not be first? It could be, but we don't know. 
- Alternatively, we can put R in third position? 

Since we don't know the position, it might be good to try R in a different position than second. For example, try R in the first position? But we don't know if it's first. We need to test new positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in position 1, so we can check if R is first. If we get feedback that R is correct, then we know. Otherwise, if it's present but wrong position, then it must be in 3,4,5.

Similarly, we can try to cover more common letters.

Let me think of a word that has R and avoids the eliminated letters. Also, it must be 5 letters.

Possible word: ""ROBOT"" -> but it has O? Wait, but O hasn't been tested. Also, it has B and T? Wait, but we don't know if O is in the word? Also, ""robot"" has repeated O? That's not ideal because we want distinct letters for maximum information? But repeated letters might be there? It's acceptable if the word has repeated letters.

But for second guess, maybe try to use distinct letters? 

Another idea: ""SPRIT"" is not a word? How about ""SPORT""? Let's check:

""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T.
- This avoids C, A, N, E. Includes R in the fourth position? Positions: 1-S, 2-P, 3-O, 4-R, 5-T. So R is in position 4.

But the word has O? We don't know if O is in the word.

Alternatively, ""GRIPT"" ? Not a common word.

Better to use common words.

Another idea: ""BIRDS""? But ""birds"" has B, I, R, D, S. 
- Avoids C, A, N, E? Yes.

But we don't know if B, I, D, S are in the word.

We should try to cover multiple common consonants and vowels.

Since we know R must be in the word, we can also try to use other common letters that haven't been tested. For example, S, T, L, etc.

I think ""ROUST"" is a word? R, O, U, S, T. But we don't have a vowel? It has O and U? Actually, vowels are important.

Recall: In English, vowels are A, E, I, O, U. We have eliminated A and E already? Yes, from the first guess: A and E are not in the word. So the secret word must have vowels from among I, O, U. So we should include one of these to test.

In our guess, it would be wise to include a vowel that hasn't been tested.

So let me try to choose a word with R and one of I, O, U, and avoid A, E (and C, N, of course).

Possible words:
- ""PIOUS"": but it has A? No, P,I,O,U,S. Wait, that's 5 letters? ""PIOUS"" is a word. But does it have R? No, it doesn't. So we must include R.

So we need R and a vowel (I, O, U).

How about ""FOURS""? But that has 5 letters? F,O,U,R,S. Yes. Avoids C, A, E, N? Yes. Includes O and U? But we have two vowels? That's okay.

But the letter R is present? Yes, in position 4? So positions: F(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), S(5). So R is not in second position? It's in fourth? Then we are testing R in fourth? If the secret word has R in fourth position, we might get a ""correct"" marker? Else, if R is in first, third, fifth? Then it would be present but wrong position.

We can also consider ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S. Avoids C, A, N, E? Yes. And has R in first position? So if R is in first position, we might get correct? If not, but R is present, then it must be elsewhere? But we know R can't be in second? Actually, in this guess, R is at position 1? So if R is at position 1 in the secret word, then we get a ""correct"" marker? Else if it's present but wrong position, then we know R isn't in first? Then it must be in positions 3,4,5? But we should also consider that R might appear more than once? But for now, assume one R? We don't know.

Actually, the feedback doesn't specify if there are multiple occurrences? We have to be cautious? But in the first guess, there was only one R? So if there are multiple R, we might have gotten a - or ✓ for the matching positions? But in ""crane"", only one R? And it was marked present? So the secret word has at least one R? But we don't know if it has two? However, for simplicity, let's assume we are trying to guess a word without double letters? But it can have double? So word like ""RURAL"" would have two R? But we shouldn't assume? Better to start with a word without repeated letters for maximum information? 

But our first guess ""crane"" had distinct letters? Similarly, second guess should ideally use distinct letters? So that we can test more? 

Therefore, let me prefer words with distinct letters.

So ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S? All distinct? R, O, I, L, S? Yes? So no repeated letters.

Similarly, ""POURS"": P, O, U, R, S? Distinct letters? O and U are both vowels? But distinct? Yes. Wait, ""POURS"" has S? So letters: P, O, U, R, S? All distinct? Yes? Or ""TURBO"": T, U, R, B, O? Distinct? Also avoids forbidden letters? 

But we have to choose one. 

Another idea: ""STIRP"" is not common? How about ""SHIRT"": S, H, I, R, T? Distinct letters? Yes. Avoids C, A, N, E? Yes. Includes R? In position 4? So positions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-I, 4-R, 5-T. So R is at fourth position.

But R was previously at second? Now we are trying at fourth? That's fine? 

We can also try R at first? So let me try that? For example, ""ROBOT"" has repeated O? So distinct? Not. So ""ROAST""? But wait, R-O-A-S-T? Wait, A is forbidden? Avoid A? So we can't use words with A? Similarly, ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D? But N is forbidden? We eliminated N.

So we must avoid letters C, A, N, E? So for ""ROUND"": has R,O,U, N? N is forbidden? So no? 

Then ""ROUND"" not allowed? Because we know N isn't in the word? So any word containing C, A, N, E isn't valid? And we must guess only valid words? 

So, a word must consist of letters from the English alphabet? And not contain forbidden letters? But the forbidden letters might be in the word? But from feedback? Actually, we know they aren?t? Because the feedback had:
C: x -> not in word? Similarly, A: x -> not in word? N: x -> not in word? E: x -> not in word? And R: - -> present but wrong position? 

Actually, the red 'x' means the letter is not in the word? So the secret word does not contain C, A, N, E? 

Therefore, our next guess must not include C, A, N, E? Because those letters are not part of the secret word? 

Similarly, we are required to guess valid English words? So we must guess a word that uses letters excluding C, A, N, E? 

So we must choose a word without C, A, N, E? and include R? 

Also, we haven't tested several common letters? For example, S, T, L, D, I, O, U, etc.

So let me pick a word that has R? In a new position? Also includes vowels? We need vowels? So among I, O, U? 

Possible words: 
- ""DIRTY"": D, I, R, T, Y? Avoids bad letters? Positions: D at 1, I at 2, R at 3? So R is in third position? 
- ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T? R in fourth? 
- ""ROYST"": not common? 
- ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T? Letters distinct? Avoids C,A,N,E? And R at second position? But R was already tried at second? And it was wrong position? But now we are trying R again? We know R is in the word? So putting R at second again? Then we will get a - marker? Because it's still the wrong position? But we don't know? Unless the secret word has R at second? But that can't be? Because in guess 1, when R was at second, it was marked as wrong position? So R cannot be at second? Therefore, we must avoid putting R at second? 

Therefore, in our next guess, we should put R at a different position? Positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? 

So for example, ""RIGHT"": R, I, G, H, T? Positions: R at 1? Avoids bad letters? But has G? 
But what if the word has R at first? Then we get ✓? Else, if R is in the word but not first? Then we get ""-"" for R? That's okay? 

Another option: ""DRIPS"": D, R, I, P, S? R at position 2? But wait, position 2? We know R was at position 2 in the first guess? And it was marked as wrong position? So putting R again at position 2? That is not forbidden? Because maybe the word has multiple R? But if the secret word does not have R at second? But if we put R at second? Then we will see? If we put R at second and it was wrong in the first guess? It might still be wrong? So we might learn that R is definitely not at second? But we already know that? So it might be redundant? 

So to avoid wasting? We should try R in a new position? So positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? 

Therefore, my plan is to try R at first position? That way? If R is at first? We get ✓? If not? We get -? But we know R is in the word? So we'll see?

Also, if R is not at first? Then the feedback will show R is present? And we'll know it's not second or first? So it must be 3,4, or5? 

Therefore, let me choose a word with R in position 1? Then we will test position 1? 

So word: ""RIGHT""? R,I,G,H,T? 
But is ""RIGHT"" a valid word? Yes? 

Also, ""RISKY"": R,I,S,K,Y? Avoids bad letters? 

""ROBOT"" has repeated O? And O is untested? But not distinct? 

I think ""RIGHT"" is okay? But let me see if better options? 

Another word: ""ROTIS"": Not common? 

How about ""RUSTS""? Repeated S? Not distinct? 

Better: ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? Avoids C,A,N,E? Distinct letters? 

Or ""ROUTS"": R,O,U,T,S? Distinct? 

Yes? ""ROUTS"" is a word? Meaning forces to leave? Yes. 

""ROUTS"": R(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), S(5)? So R at first? 

Similarly, ""ROWTH""? Uncommon? 

Another common word: ""PRISM"": P,R,I,S,M? Avoids bad letters? But R is at second position? We want to avoid second position? Since we know R isn't there? So if we put R at second? Then we will certainly get - for R? But we don't learn anything new about R's position? 

So putting R in second is not informative? 

Therefore, make R at a position we haven't tried? Currently, we've only tried position 2? So we haven't tried position 1,3,4,5? 

So I'll choose a word with R at first? 

Common options: ""RIGHT"", ""ROAST"" but ROAST has A? Which is forbidden? So no. ""ROBES"" has E? Forbidden? 

So ""RIPER""? Has E? Forbidden? 

""RIDER""? Has D and E? Avoids E? ""RIDER"" has E? No? E is forbidden? So we can't use E? 

So what word with R at first? 

""RIFTS"": R,I,F,T,S? Avoids C,A,N,E? Distinct letters? 

""RIFTS"": yes? 

Similarly, ""RISKS"": R,I,S,K,S? Repeated S? Not distinct? 

I think ""RIFTS"" is good? 

Also, ""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y? Avoids bad letters? Distinct letters? 

""RUSTY"": R(1), U(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5)? Then R at first? U at second? Which is a vowel? 

Similarly, ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? 

Which is better? Since vowels are important? We haven't tested U? Or O? 

We have the opportunity to test a vowel we haven't tried? So in ""RUSTY"", we test U? Or in ""ROWTH""? 

But O is a common vowel? Similarly U? 

Both seem fine? 

I think ""RUSTY"" is a good choice? Because it also includes S,T? Which are common? 

So I'll go with ""RUSTY""?

But let me also consider the word ""PSYCH"": but it has C? And not 5 letters? 

No? 

Another idea: ""TRUTH""? But T? And R? R is at second? Position? So ""TRUTH"": T(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), H(5)? But T repeated? And R is at second? Which we know isn't the position? 

So we avoid second? 

Therefore, I think ""RUSTY""?

But wait? We know R must be present? And we put R at first? 

Alternatively, we could put R at fifth? But that's less common? 

So I'll choose ""RUSTY"". 

So second guess: ""RUSTY""

In summary: 
- R is at position 1? So we test if R is at position 1?
- U is at position 2? Which is a vowel? 
- S at position 3?
- T at position 4?
- Y at position 5? 

We'll get feedback on these letters? 

Therefore, the guessed word is ""RUSTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is confirmed to be in the secret word but not in the second position.
- C, A, N, and E are eliminated (not in the word).

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Avoid the letters C, A, N, E.
2. Include R in a new position (not position 2) to test its location.
3. Test other common consonants and vowels (like S, T, U, Y) for maximum information.
4. Prefer distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

The word ""rusty"" fits:
- R at position 1 to test if it belongs there.
- U (an untested vowel) at position 2.
- S, T, and Y (common consonants) at positions 3, 4, and 5.
- Does not contain C, A, N, E.
- All letters are distinct.

This guess will help narrow down the position of R and test new letters efficiently.

We should choose a word that:\n1. Does not contain C, A, N, E.\n2. Includes the letter R, but not in the second position.\n3. Uses other common letters to test for other positions.\n\nWe know the secret word has R, so let\'s think about possible positions for R. Since it was in the second position in ""crane"" and was marked as wrong position, R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Wait, no: the feedback symbol for R is ""-"", meaning it\'s in the word but not in the second position. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, the positions are 1-based? Let me check:\n\nIn ""crane"":\n- Position 1: C\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 4: N\n- Position 5: E\n\nSo R was guessed in position 2, but it\'s actually in a different position. So R is present in the word, but not at index 2 (i.e., not the second letter).\n\nWe also know that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, E.\n\nWe have one known letter: R. So we need to choose a word that has R in a different position (1, 3, 4, or 5) and uses other letters that are common and not the ones we\'ve eliminated.\n\nLet me consider the alphabet. We\'ve eliminated C, A, N, E. So we should use consonants and vowels that haven\'t been tested yet.\n\nCommon vowels: We haven\'t tried I, O, U. Also, common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe also want to maximize information by using distinct letters where possible.\n\nPossible words that include R and avoid C, A, N, E:\n\nSome ideas: \n- Words starting with R: but R might not be first? It could be, but we don\'t know. \n- Alternatively, we can put R in third position? \n\nSince we don\'t know the position, it might be good to try R in a different position than second. For example, try R in the first position? But we don\'t know if it\'s first. We need to test new positions.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R in position 1, so we can check if R is first. If we get feedback that R is correct, then we know. Otherwise, if it\'s present but wrong position, then it must be in 3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, we can try to cover more common letters.\n\nLet me think of a word that has R and avoids the eliminated letters. Also, it must be 5 letters.\n\nPossible word: ""ROBOT"" -> but it has O? Wait, but O hasn\'t been tested. Also, it has B and T? Wait, but we don\'t know if O is in the word? Also, ""robot"" has repeated O? That\'s not ideal because we want distinct letters for maximum information? But repeated letters might be there? It\'s acceptable if the word has repeated letters.\n\nBut for second guess, maybe try to use distinct letters? \n\nAnother idea: ""SPRIT"" is not a word? How about ""SPORT""? Let\'s check:\n\n""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T.\n- This avoids C, A, N, E. Includes R in the fourth position? Positions: 1-S, 2-P, 3-O, 4-R, 5-T. So R is in position 4.\n\nBut the word has O? We don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\nAlternatively, ""GRIPT"" ? Not a common word.\n\nBetter to use common words.\n\nAnother idea: ""BIRDS""? But ""birds"" has B, I, R, D, S. \n- Avoids C, A, N, E? Yes.\n\nBut we don\'t know if B, I, D, S are in the word.\n\nWe should try to cover multiple common consonants and vowels.\n\nSince we know R must be in the word, we can also try to use other common letters that haven\'t been tested. For example, S, T, L, etc.\n\nI think ""ROUST"" is a word? R, O, U, S, T. But we don\'t have a vowel? It has O and U? Actually, vowels are important.\n\nRecall: In English, vowels are A, E, I, O, U. We have eliminated A and E already? Yes, from the first guess: A and E are not in the word. So the secret word must have vowels from among I, O, U. So we should include one of these to test.\n\nIn our guess, it would be wise to include a vowel that hasn\'t been tested.\n\nSo let me try to choose a word with R and one of I, O, U, and avoid A, E (and C, N, of course).\n\nPossible words:\n- ""PIOUS"": but it has A? No, P,I,O,U,S. Wait, that\'s 5 letters? ""PIOUS"" is a word. But does it have R? No, it doesn\'t. So we must include R.\n\nSo we need R and a vowel (I, O, U).\n\nHow about ""FOURS""? But that has 5 letters? F,O,U,R,S. Yes. Avoids C, A, E, N? Yes. Includes O and U? But we have two vowels? That\'s okay.\n\nBut the letter R is present? Yes, in position 4? So positions: F(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), S(5). So R is not in second position? It\'s in fourth? Then we are testing R in fourth? If the secret word has R in fourth position, we might get a ""correct"" marker? Else, if R is in first, third, fifth? Then it would be present but wrong position.\n\nWe can also consider ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S. Avoids C, A, N, E? Yes. And has R in first position? So if R is in first position, we might get correct? If not, but R is present, then it must be elsewhere? But we know R can\'t be in second? Actually, in this guess, R is at position 1? So if R is at position 1 in the secret word, then we get a ""correct"" marker? Else if it\'s present but wrong position, then we know R isn\'t in first? Then it must be in positions 3,4,5? But we should also consider that R might appear more than once? But for now, assume one R? We don\'t know.\n\nActually, the feedback doesn\'t specify if there are multiple occurrences? We have to be cautious? But in the first guess, there was only one R? So if there are multiple R, we might have gotten a - or ✓ for the matching positions? But in ""crane"", only one R? And it was marked present? So the secret word has at least one R? But we don\'t know if it has two? However, for simplicity, let\'s assume we are trying to guess a word without double letters? But it can have double? So word like ""RURAL"" would have two R? But we shouldn\'t assume? Better to start with a word without repeated letters for maximum information? \n\nBut our first guess ""crane"" had distinct letters? Similarly, second guess should ideally use distinct letters? So that we can test more? \n\nTherefore, let me prefer words with distinct letters.\n\nSo ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S? All distinct? R, O, I, L, S? Yes? So no repeated letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""POURS"": P, O, U, R, S? Distinct letters? O and U are both vowels? But distinct? Yes. Wait, ""POURS"" has S? So letters: P, O, U, R, S? All distinct? Yes? Or ""TURBO"": T, U, R, B, O? Distinct? Also avoids forbidden letters? \n\nBut we have to choose one. \n\nAnother idea: ""STIRP"" is not common? How about ""SHIRT"": S, H, I, R, T? Distinct letters? Yes. Avoids C, A, N, E? Yes. Includes R? In position 4? So positions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-I, 4-R, 5-T. So R is at fourth position.\n\nBut R was previously at second? Now we are trying at fourth? That\'s fine? \n\nWe can also try R at first? So let me try that? For example, ""ROBOT"" has repeated O? So distinct? Not. So ""ROAST""? But wait, R-O-A-S-T? Wait, A is forbidden? Avoid A? So we can\'t use words with A? Similarly, ""ROUND"": R, O, U, N, D? But N is forbidden? We eliminated N.\n\nSo we must avoid letters C, A, N, E? So for ""ROUND"": has R,O,U, N? N is forbidden? So no? \n\nThen ""ROUND"" not allowed? Because we know N isn\'t in the word? So any word containing C, A, N, E isn\'t valid? And we must guess only valid words? \n\nSo, a word must consist of letters from the English alphabet? And not contain forbidden letters? But the forbidden letters might be in the word? But from feedback? Actually, we know they aren?t? Because the feedback had:\nC: x -> not in word? Similarly, A: x -> not in word? N: x -> not in word? E: x -> not in word? And R: - -> present but wrong position? \n\nActually, the red \'x\' means the letter is not in the word? So the secret word does not contain C, A, N, E? \n\nTherefore, our next guess must not include C, A, N, E? Because those letters are not part of the secret word? \n\nSimilarly, we are required to guess valid English words? So we must guess a word that uses letters excluding C, A, N, E? \n\nSo we must choose a word without C, A, N, E? and include R? \n\nAlso, we haven\'t tested several common letters? For example, S, T, L, D, I, O, U, etc.\n\nSo let me pick a word that has R? In a new position? Also includes vowels? We need vowels? So among I, O, U? \n\nPossible words: \n- ""DIRTY"": D, I, R, T, Y? Avoids bad letters? Positions: D at 1, I at 2, R at 3? So R is in third position? \n- ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T? R in fourth? \n- ""ROYST"": not common? \n- ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T? Letters distinct? Avoids C,A,N,E? And R at second position? But R was already tried at second? And it was wrong position? But now we are trying R again? We know R is in the word? So putting R at second again? Then we will get a - marker? Because it\'s still the wrong position? But we don\'t know? Unless the secret word has R at second? But that can\'t be? Because in guess 1, when R was at second, it was marked as wrong position? So R cannot be at second? Therefore, we must avoid putting R at second? \n\nTherefore, in our next guess, we should put R at a different position? Positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? \n\nSo for example, ""RIGHT"": R, I, G, H, T? Positions: R at 1? Avoids bad letters? But has G? \nBut what if the word has R at first? Then we get ✓? Else, if R is in the word but not first? Then we get ""-"" for R? That\'s okay? \n\nAnother option: ""DRIPS"": D, R, I, P, S? R at position 2? But wait, position 2? We know R was at position 2 in the first guess? And it was marked as wrong position? So putting R again at position 2? That is not forbidden? Because maybe the word has multiple R? But if the secret word does not have R at second? But if we put R at second? Then we will see? If we put R at second and it was wrong in the first guess? It might still be wrong? So we might learn that R is definitely not at second? But we already know that? So it might be redundant? \n\nSo to avoid wasting? We should try R in a new position? So positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? \n\nTherefore, my plan is to try R at first position? That way? If R is at first? We get ✓? If not? We get -? But we know R is in the word? So we\'ll see?\n\nAlso, if R is not at first? Then the feedback will show R is present? And we\'ll know it\'s not second or first? So it must be 3,4, or5? \n\nTherefore, let me choose a word with R in position 1? Then we will test position 1? \n\nSo word: ""RIGHT""? R,I,G,H,T? \nBut is ""RIGHT"" a valid word? Yes? \n\nAlso, ""RISKY"": R,I,S,K,Y? Avoids bad letters? \n\n""ROBOT"" has repeated O? And O is untested? But not distinct? \n\nI think ""RIGHT"" is okay? But let me see if better options? \n\nAnother word: ""ROTIS"": Not common? \n\nHow about ""RUSTS""? Repeated S? Not distinct? \n\nBetter: ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? Avoids C,A,N,E? Distinct letters? \n\nOr ""ROUTS"": R,O,U,T,S? Distinct? \n\nYes? ""ROUTS"" is a word? Meaning forces to leave? Yes. \n\n""ROUTS"": R(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), S(5)? So R at first? \n\nSimilarly, ""ROWTH""? Uncommon? \n\nAnother common word: ""PRISM"": P,R,I,S,M? Avoids bad letters? But R is at second position? We want to avoid second position? Since we know R isn\'t there? So if we put R at second? Then we will certainly get - for R? But we don\'t learn anything new about R\'s position? \n\nSo putting R in second is not informative? \n\nTherefore, make R at a position we haven\'t tried? Currently, we\'ve only tried position 2? So we haven\'t tried position 1,3,4,5? \n\nSo I\'ll choose a word with R at first? \n\nCommon options: ""RIGHT"", ""ROAST"" but ROAST has A? Which is forbidden? So no. ""ROBES"" has E? Forbidden? \n\nSo ""RIPER""? Has E? Forbidden? \n\n""RIDER""? Has D and E? Avoids E? ""RIDER"" has E? No? E is forbidden? So we can\'t use E? \n\nSo what word with R at first? \n\n""RIFTS"": R,I,F,T,S? Avoids C,A,N,E? Distinct letters? \n\n""RIFTS"": yes? \n\nSimilarly, ""RISKS"": R,I,S,K,S? Repeated S? Not distinct? \n\nI think ""RIFTS"" is good? \n\nAlso, ""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y? Avoids bad letters? Distinct letters? \n\n""RUSTY"": R(1), U(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5)? Then R at first? U at second? Which is a vowel? \n\nSimilarly, ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? \n\nWhich is better? Since vowels are important? We haven\'t tested U? Or O? \n\nWe have the opportunity to test a vowel we haven\'t tried? So in ""RUSTY"", we test U? Or in ""ROWTH""? \n\nBut O is a common vowel? Similarly U? \n\nBoth seem fine? \n\nI think ""RUSTY"" is a good choice? Because it also includes S,T? Which are common? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""RUSTY""?\n\nBut let me also consider the word ""PSYCH"": but it has C? And not 5 letters? \n\nNo? \n\nAnother idea: ""TRUTH""? But T? And R? R is at second? Position? So ""TRUTH"": T(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), H(5)? But T repeated? And R is at second? Which we know isn\'t the position? \n\nSo we avoid second? \n\nTherefore, I think ""RUSTY""?\n\nBut wait? We know R must be present? And we put R at first? \n\nAlternatively, we could put R at fifth? But that\'s less common? \n\nSo I\'ll choose ""RUSTY"". \n\nSo second guess: ""RUSTY""\n\nIn summary: \n- R is at position 1? So we test if R is at position 1?\n- U is at position 2? Which is a vowel? \n- S at position 3?\n- T at position 4?\n- Y at position 5? \n\nWe\'ll get feedback on these letters? \n\nTherefore, the guessed word is ""RUSTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is confirmed to be in the secret word but not in the second position.\n- C, A, N, and E are eliminated (not in the word).\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n1. Avoid the letters C, A, N, E.\n2. Include R in a new position (not position 2) to test its location.\n3. Test other common consonants and vowels (like S, T, U, Y) for maximum information.\n4. Prefer distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n\nThe word ""rusty"" fits:\n- R at position 1 to test if it belongs there.\n- U (an untested vowel) at position 2.\n- S, T, and Y (common consonants) at positions 3, 4, and 5.\n- Does not contain C, A, N, E.\n- All letters are distinct.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of R and test new letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>rusty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: rusty -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) U(x) S(✓) T(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C: not in the word
- R: in the word but wrong position (not at position 2)
- A: not in the word
- N: not in the word
- E: not in the word

So the secret word contains R (but not at position 2) and does not contain C, A, N, E.

Guess 2: ""rusty"" -> R(✓) U(x) S(✓) T(x) Y(✓)
Meaning:
- R: correct and in the correct position (position 1)
- U: not in the word
- S: correct and in the correct position (position 3)
- T: not in the word
- Y: correct and in the correct position (position 5)

So from this, we know:
- The secret word has R at position 1, S at position 3, and Y at position 5.
- The secret word does not contain U or T (and also not C, A, N, E from before).
- The letters not in the word so far: C, A, N, E, U, T.

Also, since R is at position 1, that matches the feedback from guess 1 that R was present but not at position 2 (which is consistent because now it's at 1).

Now, the secret word pattern is: R _ S _ Y

We need to fill in the second and fourth positions.

We know the word does not contain: C, A, N, E, U, T.

We have two positions to guess: position 2 and position 4.

We need to choose letters that are not in the forbidden set and form a valid English word.

Possible letters for position 2 and 4: any letter except C, A, N, E, U, T.

We should consider common letters that haven't been tested yet.

Letters we have used: R, U, S, T, Y (from guess 2) and C, A, N, E (from guess 1). So we have used: C, R, A, N, E, U, S, T, Y.

So unused common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But we need to form a word of the pattern R _ S _ Y.

We can think of words that fit R?S?Y.

Since we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many common letters as possible in the two positions.

But we have two positions, so we can only test two new letters? Actually, we can test two letters, but we might get information about both.

We must avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid forbidden letters.

The word must be: R _ S _ Y

Possible words:

- RISKY: R I S K Y -> positions: R(1), I(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5). But we have S at position 3 and Y at 5? Yes. Now, check letters: I and K are not forbidden? I is not in the forbidden list? Forbidden: C,A,N,E,U,T. So I is allowed. K is allowed. But we have to check if ""risky"" is a valid word? Yes.

But wait, in guess 2, we have S at position 3 and Y at 5, which matches. But we need to see if the word is possible.

However, we don't know if I and K are in the word? But we can guess ""risky"" to test.

But we have only 6 guesses? We are on guess 3? So we can try.

Another word: ""rosy"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

""raspy"": R A S P Y -> but A is forbidden? A is in the forbidden list? From guess 1, A is not in the word. So ""raspy"" has A? So invalid.

""rushy"": R U S H Y -> but U is forbidden? From guess 2, U is not in the word. So ""rushy"" has U? Invalid.

""rusty"" we already tried? And it had T? Which is forbidden? But we tried ""rusty"" and T was not in the word? So we can't use T again? But in ""rusty"", T was at position 4 and marked not in word? So T is forbidden? So we can't use T.

Similarly, ""rusty"" is not the word? Because we got feedback that U and T are not in the word? And R,S,Y are correct? But the word is not ""rusty"" because U and T are not in the word? So the secret word has R, S, Y at positions 1,3,5? But not U and T? So it must be a different word.

Back to possible words:

- ""risky"": R I S K Y -> I at 2, K at 4? Both not forbidden? So possible.

- ""rosin"": but that ends with N? N is forbidden? And pattern must end with Y? So no.

- ""roomy"": R O O M Y -> but O repeated? And pattern has S at position 3? But ""roomy"" has O at position 3? Not S? So doesn't match the pattern? We need S at position 3? So the third letter must be S.

So the word must have S at position 3? So it must be R ? S ? Y

So ""roomy"" is not.

- ""raspy"": has A? Forbidden.

- ""rally"": has A and L? But A forbidden? And no S at position 3? It has L at 3? Not S? So no.

- ""risky"" seems good.

- ""resay"": but E is forbidden? And A? So no.

- ""rishi"": not common? And ends with I? Not Y? So no.

- ""rocky"": has C and K? C forbidden? And no S at 3? It has C at 3? Not S? So no.

- ""ropy"": 4 letters.

- ""raspy"" invalid.

- ""risky"" is one option.

Another word: ""rosed"": but E and D? E forbidden? And not ending with Y? It ends with D? So no.

""rindy"": has N? Forbidden.

""rimsy""? Not a word? 

""ribsy""? Not a word.

""wispy"": but starts with W? Not R? So pattern must start with R.

So we need R at start, S at third, Y at end.

So ""risky"" is a valid word.

Another one: ""raspy"" invalid.

""rushy"" invalid.

""reefy"": E forbidden.

""reify"": E forbidden? R E I F Y? E at position 2? Forbidden? So no.

""riley"": has E? Forbidden.

""ripely"": too long.

""risky"" seems the most common.

But is there ""rispy""? Not a word? 

""ritzy"": R I T Z Y -> T is forbidden? From guess 2, T is not in the word? So we cannot use T? So ""ritzy"" has T? Invalid.

""rindy"": N forbidden.

""rinky"": N forbidden.

""palsy"": not starting with R.

So I think ""risky"" is a good candidate.

But let me confirm: R I S K Y.

Letters: R, I, S, K, Y.

We know R, S, Y are in the word and in correct positions? But we are guessing I and K? 

If we guess ""risky"", then:

- If the secret word is ""risky"", we win.

- If not, we get feedback on I and K.

But we have to consider that the fourth letter might be something else? 

Another word: ""rosed"" invalid.

""rowdy"": R O W D Y -> but no S at position 3? It has O at 2, W at 3? But we need S at position 3? So ""rowdy"" has W at 3? Not S? So it doesn't match? Because S must be at position 3? So the third letter must be S? So ""rowdy"" is not possible? Because it has W at position 3? But we know position 3 is S? So it must be S? So the word must have S at position 3? So ""rowdy"" is invalid for the pattern.

Similarly, only words with S at position 3 and Y at 5? And R at 1.

So possible words: 

- risky: R I S K Y
- Is there ""resky""? Not a word.
- ""rusky""? But U and S? U is forbidden? And S is at 3? But ""rusky"" would be R U S K Y? U at 2? But U is forbidden? So no.
- ""raspy"" invalid.
- ""rosy"" too short.

What about ""raspy""? No, A forbidden.

Another one: ""reasty""? Not common? And has E? 

I think ""risky"" is the only common word? 

But let me think: ""rhy"" something? ""rhymy""? Not a word.

""rimsy""? Not in dictionary.

So I think ""risky"" is a good guess.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But in this pattern, R, S, Y are fixed? And we are guessing two new letters? 

We can also consider ""rishi"" but not ending with Y.

So I'll go with ""risky"".

But we have to make sure that the letters I and K are not forbidden? They are not? Because we haven't used them? And they are not in the forbidden list? Forbidden: C,A,N,E,U,T? So I and K are allowed.

Therefore, guess ""risky"".

But let me double-check the pattern: R _ S _ Y -> with I at 2 and K at 4? So ""risky"".

If it's not ""risky"", then we get feedback on I and K? Which will help for the next guess.

But we have 4 guesses left? So it's okay.

Perhaps there is another word? ""rosed"" no.

""ropy"" no.

""rushy"" no.

""risky"" seems the best.

Another one: ""repsy""? Not a word.

So I think ""risky"" is the guess.

Therefore, the third guess is ""risky"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  This means:  
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 2.  
  - C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""rusty"" → Feedback: R(✓) U(x) S(✓) T(x) Y(✓)**  
  This means:  
  - R is correct and in position 1.  
  - S is correct and in position 3.  
  - Y is correct and in position 5.  
  - U and T are not in the secret word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: **R _ S _ Y** (positions: 1=R, 3=S, 5=Y).  
- Confirmed absent letters: **C, A, N, E, U, T**.  
- Position 2 and position 4 need to be filled with letters not in the absent list.  
- Common letters not yet tested include: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
- The word ""risky"" fits the pattern (R I S K Y) and tests two new common letters (I and K) in the unknown positions. If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, the feedback will provide information about position 2 and 4.  

Given this, the next guess is **""risky""** to efficiently test the pattern and new letters.  

<guess>risky</guess>",risky,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C: not in the word
- R: in the word but wrong position (not at position 2)
- A: not in the word
- N: not in the word
- E: not in the word

So the secret word contains R (but not at position 2) and does not contain C, A, N, E.

Guess 2: ""rusty"" -> R(✓) U(x) S(✓) T(x) Y(✓)
Meaning:
- R: correct and in the correct position (position 1)
- U: not in the word
- S: correct and in the correct position (position 3)
- T: not in the word
- Y: correct and in the correct position (position 5)

So from this, we know:
- The secret word has R at position 1, S at position 3, and Y at position 5.
- The secret word does not contain U or T (and also not C, A, N, E from before).
- The letters not in the word so far: C, A, N, E, U, T.

Also, since R is at position 1, that matches the feedback from guess 1 that R was present but not at position 2 (which is consistent because now it's at 1).

Now, the secret word pattern is: R _ S _ Y

We need to fill in the second and fourth positions.

We know the word does not contain: C, A, N, E, U, T.

We have two positions to guess: position 2 and position 4.

We need to choose letters that are not in the forbidden set and form a valid English word.

Possible letters for position 2 and 4: any letter except C, A, N, E, U, T.

We should consider common letters that haven't been tested yet.

Letters we have used: R, U, S, T, Y (from guess 2) and C, A, N, E (from guess 1). So we have used: C, R, A, N, E, U, S, T, Y.

So unused common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But we need to form a word of the pattern R _ S _ Y.

We can think of words that fit R?S?Y.

Since we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many common letters as possible in the two positions.

But we have two positions, so we can only test two new letters? Actually, we can test two letters, but we might get information about both.

We must avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid forbidden letters.

The word must be: R _ S _ Y

Possible words:

- RISKY: R I S K Y -> positions: R(1), I(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5). But we have S at position 3 and Y at 5? Yes. Now, check letters: I and K are not forbidden? I is not in the forbidden list? Forbidden: C,A,N,E,U,T. So I is allowed. K is allowed. But we have to check if ""risky"" is a valid word? Yes.

But wait, in guess 2, we have S at position 3 and Y at 5, which matches. But we need to see if the word is possible.

However, we don't know if I and K are in the word? But we can guess ""risky"" to test.

But we have only 6 guesses? We are on guess 3? So we can try.

Another word: ""rosy"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

""raspy"": R A S P Y -> but A is forbidden? A is in the forbidden list? From guess 1, A is not in the word. So ""raspy"" has A? So invalid.

""rushy"": R U S H Y -> but U is forbidden? From guess 2, U is not in the word. So ""rushy"" has U? Invalid.

""rusty"" we already tried? And it had T? Which is forbidden? But we tried ""rusty"" and T was not in the word? So we can't use T again? But in ""rusty"", T was at position 4 and marked not in word? So T is forbidden? So we can't use T.

Similarly, ""rusty"" is not the word? Because we got feedback that U and T are not in the word? And R,S,Y are correct? But the word is not ""rusty"" because U and T are not in the word? So the secret word has R, S, Y at positions 1,3,5? But not U and T? So it must be a different word.

Back to possible words:

- ""risky"": R I S K Y -> I at 2, K at 4? Both not forbidden? So possible.

- ""rosin"": but that ends with N? N is forbidden? And pattern must end with Y? So no.

- ""roomy"": R O O M Y -> but O repeated? And pattern has S at position 3? But ""roomy"" has O at position 3? Not S? So doesn't match the pattern? We need S at position 3? So the third letter must be S.

So the word must have S at position 3? So it must be R ? S ? Y

So ""roomy"" is not.

- ""raspy"": has A? Forbidden.

- ""rally"": has A and L? But A forbidden? And no S at position 3? It has L at 3? Not S? So no.

- ""risky"" seems good.

- ""resay"": but E is forbidden? And A? So no.

- ""rishi"": not common? And ends with I? Not Y? So no.

- ""rocky"": has C and K? C forbidden? And no S at 3? It has C at 3? Not S? So no.

- ""ropy"": 4 letters.

- ""raspy"" invalid.

- ""risky"" is one option.

Another word: ""rosed"": but E and D? E forbidden? And not ending with Y? It ends with D? So no.

""rindy"": has N? Forbidden.

""rimsy""? Not a word? 

""ribsy""? Not a word.

""wispy"": but starts with W? Not R? So pattern must start with R.

So we need R at start, S at third, Y at end.

So ""risky"" is a valid word.

Another one: ""raspy"" invalid.

""rushy"" invalid.

""reefy"": E forbidden.

""reify"": E forbidden? R E I F Y? E at position 2? Forbidden? So no.

""riley"": has E? Forbidden.

""ripely"": too long.

""risky"" seems the most common.

But is there ""rispy""? Not a word? 

""ritzy"": R I T Z Y -> T is forbidden? From guess 2, T is not in the word? So we cannot use T? So ""ritzy"" has T? Invalid.

""rindy"": N forbidden.

""rinky"": N forbidden.

""palsy"": not starting with R.

So I think ""risky"" is a good candidate.

But let me confirm: R I S K Y.

Letters: R, I, S, K, Y.

We know R, S, Y are in the word and in correct positions? But we are guessing I and K? 

If we guess ""risky"", then:

- If the secret word is ""risky"", we win.

- If not, we get feedback on I and K.

But we have to consider that the fourth letter might be something else? 

Another word: ""rosed"" invalid.

""rowdy"": R O W D Y -> but no S at position 3? It has O at 2, W at 3? But we need S at position 3? So ""rowdy"" has W at 3? Not S? So it doesn't match? Because S must be at position 3? So the third letter must be S? So ""rowdy"" is not possible? Because it has W at position 3? But we know position 3 is S? So it must be S? So the word must have S at position 3? So ""rowdy"" is invalid for the pattern.

Similarly, only words with S at position 3 and Y at 5? And R at 1.

So possible words: 

- risky: R I S K Y
- Is there ""resky""? Not a word.
- ""rusky""? But U and S? U is forbidden? And S is at 3? But ""rusky"" would be R U S K Y? U at 2? But U is forbidden? So no.
- ""raspy"" invalid.
- ""rosy"" too short.

What about ""raspy""? No, A forbidden.

Another one: ""reasty""? Not common? And has E? 

I think ""risky"" is the only common word? 

But let me think: ""rhy"" something? ""rhymy""? Not a word.

""rimsy""? Not in dictionary.

So I think ""risky"" is a good guess.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But in this pattern, R, S, Y are fixed? And we are guessing two new letters? 

We can also consider ""rishi"" but not ending with Y.

So I'll go with ""risky"".

But we have to make sure that the letters I and K are not forbidden? They are not? Because we haven't used them? And they are not in the forbidden list? Forbidden: C,A,N,E,U,T? So I and K are allowed.

Therefore, guess ""risky"".

But let me double-check the pattern: R _ S _ Y -> with I at 2 and K at 4? So ""risky"".

If it's not ""risky"", then we get feedback on I and K? Which will help for the next guess.

But we have 4 guesses left? So it's okay.

Perhaps there is another word? ""rosed"" no.

""ropy"" no.

""rushy"" no.

""risky"" seems the best.

Another one: ""repsy""? Not a word.

So I think ""risky"" is the guess.

Therefore, the third guess is ""risky"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)**
