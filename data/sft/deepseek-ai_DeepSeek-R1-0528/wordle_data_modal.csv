We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position (since in ""CRANE"", A is the third letter and got ""-"" meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the word must include A and excludes C, R, N, E.

Since A is present but not in position 3, it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We have five new letters that we know are not in the word: C, R, N, E. Also, R is excluded which is common, so we avoid words with R.

For the next guess, we want to try:
- Include A, but not in the third position.
- Avoid C, R, N, E.
- Try to use other common letters to test for their presence.

Common letters left: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

We should choose a word that has A in a position other than 3, and includes other vowels or common consonants.

Possible positions for A: let's try to put A in the first position for example? Or second? We don't know, so we can choose a word that has A in a different spot.

Some options:
- Words with A at the start: ALIKE, ALONE, but must avoid R, C, N, E. ALONE has N and E -> invalid.
- Words with A at the end: PIZZA? But double letters? We don't know if duplicated letters are allowed? The rules didn't say, but typically they are. However, PIZZA has Z which is uncommon and we want to test more letters.

Better: Try words that use common letters.

Consider: SALAD? But has L and D? But SALAD: positions: S A L A D -> but A appears twice? The feedback for duplicate letters can be tricky. Let's avoid duplicates for now.

To get more coverage, let's avoid repeating letters.

Common words without C, R, N, E and with A not in position 3.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's think of a word that has A and some other vowels or common consonants.

Perhaps STAFF? But duplicate F. Avoid.

Another idea: SHALT? But that might not be common. Or valid? We need valid English words.

Perhaps: PLANT? But has N -> excluded.

We cannot use N.

So, let's list possible 5-letter words with A, excluding C, R, N, E.

Example: SALAD (but duplicate A) -> but maybe acceptable? However, note that if the secret word has only one A, the feedback might mark the second A as absent? We don't know the secret word's letter frequency.

To keep it simple, let's choose a word with distinct letters.

Possible words:
- BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> A is second. Positions: B=1, A=2, L=3, M=4, Y=5.
Avoids C,R,N,E.

- SALTY: S,A,L,T,Y -> but S=1, A=2, L=3, T=4, Y=5. But L is third, which was the position for A? Doesn't matter. But we can try.

- PASTA: has A twice? Positions? P-A-S-T-A -> duplicates.

- I think BALMY is a good word: letters B, A, L, M, Y. All distinct. A is in second position (not position 3).

Alternatively, we could try to put A in another position. For example, in position 4: PULSA? Not common. Or position 1: ABOVE? But O and E -> E is excluded. Invalid.

Position 1: AWAIT? Has A twice and T twice? Messy.

Position 5: DEALT? But D,E,A,L,T -> E is excluded? YES, E is excluded. So invalid because DEALT has E.

How about: DRAWL? Has R -> excluded.

Cannot have R.

So, BALMY seems reasonable.

Another option: TOUCH? but has U and O? And no A? But we have to include A? No, the feedback says A is present, so we must include A in the guess to get feedback on its position.

Wait, let's reread the feedback: A is in the word (because it got '-'), so we know the secret word contains A. Therefore, we must include A in our next guess to gather more information about its position.

Therefore, we need a word that includes A, and avoids C,R,N,E and has distinct letters if possible.

BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> distinct letters, A in position 2.

Possible common word: SALTY? S, A, L, T, Y -> distinct? Yes, and avoid C,R,N,E. S A L T Y, S=1, A=2, L=3, T=4, Y=5.

Which one? BALMY vs SALTY.

We have no information about the other letters, so both are fine. Let's pick SALTY because S and T are very common.

But be cautious: in SALTY, A is in position 2, which is different from position 3 (so we can test if A is in position 2).

We also want to test other common letters. For example T, L, S.

SALTY: letters S, A, L, T, Y.

We are not including E, which we already know is absent.

So, let's go with SALTY.

But wait, what about vowels? We need to check other vowels? The word might have other vowels like O, I, U.

In SALTY, we have A and no other vowels? L and Y? But Y can be a vowel? Yes, but still, we miss testing O or I.

BALMY has A and Y? Similar.

Another idea: PAINT? But has N -> excluded.

Avoid N.

Perhaps STAID? S, T, A, I, D -> letters: S, T, A, I, D. Distinct. Avoids C,R,N,E. And A is in position 3? Wait, STAID: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). But our feedback from before said A is not in position 3? In ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position (so present elsewhere). Therefore, in STAID, we are putting A in position 3 again, but we know it's not correct. We can do that to test other letters? Alternatively, putting A in another position might be better for locating A.

In STAID, A is in position 3, which we suspect might be wrong? Actually, we know from the first guess that in position 3 the letter was A and it wasn't correct (since it was misplaced), so putting A again in position 3 doesn't help us find where A should be.

It would be better to try A in a different position. So BALMY or SALTY put A in position 2, which hasn't been tested.

Similarly, we could try A in position 1 or 4.

Let's try to choose a word with A in position 1: for example, ABOUT? But O, U, T, but B, and has U and O? But ABOUT has E? No, ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> no E? But ABOUT is a word? However, ABOUT has U and O, but we don't know.

ABOUT: letters A, B, O, U, T -> distinct? Yes, and avoids C,R,N,E? E is not in, so valid. A is in position 1.

Another: APIAN? Not common.

ADIEU? Has E -> excluded, invalid.

So ABOUT: A(1), B(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). But O and U? Very common.

Since we know A is present, and we want to check position 1.

But BALMY has A in 2, SALTY in 2, ABOUT in 1.

All reasonable. Let me choose ABOUT since it has more vowels? But O and U.

We can also consider: TIPSY? but no A.

We must include A.

Let me go with SALTY.

SALTY: guess with S, A, L, T, Y.

But Y is less common, while ABOUT has O and U which are more common? Not sure.

We already know that common consonants excluded: C,R,N,E. So others are S,T,L,B,M,P etc.

Another word: PLAID? but has L, A, I, D? P,L,A,I,D? but P=1, L=2, A=3. Again A in position 3? We know it's not the right spot? But PLAID has A in position 3? Not efficient.

Better to avoid position 3 for A until we know more.

So SALTY: S A L T Y -> positions: A is second.

Let's choose SALTY.

But wait, SALTY has A in position 2, and we have no information about position 2 yet.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that puts A in position 4 or 5.

Position 4: FABLE? but B,L,E? -> E excluded, invalid.

Position 4: VALID? V,A,L,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes, V(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), D(5) -> A is in position 2? Not 4.

How about: KOALA? duplicates and K uncommon.

Position 4: MANGA? duplicates.

MEDIA? E? invalid.

So it's hard to find A in position 4 without excluded letters.

Position 5: ULTRA? but R -> excluded.

SKYLA? not word.

BAYOU? A in position 3? B,A,Y,O,U -> A is second? Not fifth.

Words with A at the end: EXTRA? has E and R and X? -> E excluded, R excluded.

PIZZA? duplicates, uncommon.

So perhaps SALTY is a practical choice.

I think I'll go with SALTY.

But another option: STAIR? has R, excluded.

Since R is excluded, avoid.

So SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y.

Letters: S, A, L, T, Y — all distinct and common except Y maybe.

We can also do: SALSA? duplicates S and A.

So distinct is better.

Therefore, my next guess will be SALTY.

So after thinking, I choose SALTY.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position.
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word.

- The word should use new common letters to maximize information gain, such as S, T, L, and avoid repeated letters if possible.

After evaluating options:
- ""salty"" includes A (in the second position) and avoids C, R, N, E. It uses common consonants S, T, L and adds Y for coverage.
- This choice tests letters that haven't been used and positions A in a new location (position 2) to gather feedback on both the presence and positioning of A and other letters.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position (since in ""CRANE"", A is the third letter and got ""-"" meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the word must include A and excludes C, R, N, E.

Since A is present but not in position 3, it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We have five new letters that we know are not in the word: C, R, N, E. Also, R is excluded which is common, so we avoid words with R.

For the next guess, we want to try:
- Include A, but not in the third position.
- Avoid C, R, N, E.
- Try to use other common letters to test for their presence.

Common letters left: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

We should choose a word that has A in a position other than 3, and includes other vowels or common consonants.

Possible positions for A: let's try to put A in the first position for example? Or second? We don't know, so we can choose a word that has A in a different spot.

Some options:
- Words with A at the start: ALIKE, ALONE, but must avoid R, C, N, E. ALONE has N and E -> invalid.
- Words with A at the end: PIZZA? But double letters? We don't know if duplicated letters are allowed? The rules didn't say, but typically they are. However, PIZZA has Z which is uncommon and we want to test more letters.

Better: Try words that use common letters.

Consider: SALAD? But has L and D? But SALAD: positions: S A L A D -> but A appears twice? The feedback for duplicate letters can be tricky. Let's avoid duplicates for now.

To get more coverage, let's avoid repeating letters.

Common words without C, R, N, E and with A not in position 3.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's think of a word that has A and some other vowels or common consonants.

Perhaps STAFF? But duplicate F. Avoid.

Another idea: SHALT? But that might not be common. Or valid? We need valid English words.

Perhaps: PLANT? But has N -> excluded.

We cannot use N.

So, let's list possible 5-letter words with A, excluding C, R, N, E.

Example: SALAD (but duplicate A) -> but maybe acceptable? However, note that if the secret word has only one A, the feedback might mark the second A as absent? We don't know the secret word's letter frequency.

To keep it simple, let's choose a word with distinct letters.

Possible words:
- BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> A is second. Positions: B=1, A=2, L=3, M=4, Y=5.
Avoids C,R,N,E.

- SALTY: S,A,L,T,Y -> but S=1, A=2, L=3, T=4, Y=5. But L is third, which was the position for A? Doesn't matter. But we can try.

- PASTA: has A twice? Positions? P-A-S-T-A -> duplicates.

- I think BALMY is a good word: letters B, A, L, M, Y. All distinct. A is in second position (not position 3).

Alternatively, we could try to put A in another position. For example, in position 4: PULSA? Not common. Or position 1: ABOVE? But O and E -> E is excluded. Invalid.

Position 1: AWAIT? Has A twice and T twice? Messy.

Position 5: DEALT? But D,E,A,L,T -> E is excluded? YES, E is excluded. So invalid because DEALT has E.

How about: DRAWL? Has R -> excluded.

Cannot have R.

So, BALMY seems reasonable.

Another option: TOUCH? but has U and O? And no A? But we have to include A? No, the feedback says A is present, so we must include A in the guess to get feedback on its position.

Wait, let's reread the feedback: A is in the word (because it got '-'), so we know the secret word contains A. Therefore, we must include A in our next guess to gather more information about its position.

Therefore, we need a word that includes A, and avoids C,R,N,E and has distinct letters if possible.

BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> distinct letters, A in position 2.

Possible common word: SALTY? S, A, L, T, Y -> distinct? Yes, and avoid C,R,N,E. S A L T Y, S=1, A=2, L=3, T=4, Y=5.

Which one? BALMY vs SALTY.

We have no information about the other letters, so both are fine. Let's pick SALTY because S and T are very common.

But be cautious: in SALTY, A is in position 2, which is different from position 3 (so we can test if A is in position 2).

We also want to test other common letters. For example T, L, S.

SALTY: letters S, A, L, T, Y.

We are not including E, which we already know is absent.

So, let's go with SALTY.

But wait, what about vowels? We need to check other vowels? The word might have other vowels like O, I, U.

In SALTY, we have A and no other vowels? L and Y? But Y can be a vowel? Yes, but still, we miss testing O or I.

BALMY has A and Y? Similar.

Another idea: PAINT? But has N -> excluded.

Avoid N.

Perhaps STAID? S, T, A, I, D -> letters: S, T, A, I, D. Distinct. Avoids C,R,N,E. And A is in position 3? Wait, STAID: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). But our feedback from before said A is not in position 3? In ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position (so present elsewhere). Therefore, in STAID, we are putting A in position 3 again, but we know it's not correct. We can do that to test other letters? Alternatively, putting A in another position might be better for locating A.

In STAID, A is in position 3, which we suspect might be wrong? Actually, we know from the first guess that in position 3 the letter was A and it wasn't correct (since it was misplaced), so putting A again in position 3 doesn't help us find where A should be.

It would be better to try A in a different position. So BALMY or SALTY put A in position 2, which hasn't been tested.

Similarly, we could try A in position 1 or 4.

Let's try to choose a word with A in position 1: for example, ABOUT? But O, U, T, but B, and has U and O? But ABOUT has E? No, ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> no E? But ABOUT is a word? However, ABOUT has U and O, but we don't know.

ABOUT: letters A, B, O, U, T -> distinct? Yes, and avoids C,R,N,E? E is not in, so valid. A is in position 1.

Another: APIAN? Not common.

ADIEU? Has E -> excluded, invalid.

So ABOUT: A(1), B(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). But O and U? Very common.

Since we know A is present, and we want to check position 1.

But BALMY has A in 2, SALTY in 2, ABOUT in 1.

All reasonable. Let me choose ABOUT since it has more vowels? But O and U.

We can also consider: TIPSY? but no A.

We must include A.

Let me go with SALTY.

SALTY: guess with S, A, L, T, Y.

But Y is less common, while ABOUT has O and U which are more common? Not sure.

We already know that common consonants excluded: C,R,N,E. So others are S,T,L,B,M,P etc.

Another word: PLAID? but has L, A, I, D? P,L,A,I,D? but P=1, L=2, A=3. Again A in position 3? We know it's not the right spot? But PLAID has A in position 3? Not efficient.

Better to avoid position 3 for A until we know more.

So SALTY: S A L T Y -> positions: A is second.

Let's choose SALTY.

But wait, SALTY has A in position 2, and we have no information about position 2 yet.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that puts A in position 4 or 5.

Position 4: FABLE? but B,L,E? -> E excluded, invalid.

Position 4: VALID? V,A,L,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes, V(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), D(5) -> A is in position 2? Not 4.

How about: KOALA? duplicates and K uncommon.

Position 4: MANGA? duplicates.

MEDIA? E? invalid.

So it's hard to find A in position 4 without excluded letters.

Position 5: ULTRA? but R -> excluded.

SKYLA? not word.

BAYOU? A in position 3? B,A,Y,O,U -> A is second? Not fifth.

Words with A at the end: EXTRA? has E and R and X? -> E excluded, R excluded.

PIZZA? duplicates, uncommon.

So perhaps SALTY is a practical choice.

I think I'll go with SALTY.

But another option: STAIR? has R, excluded.

Since R is excluded, avoid.

So SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y.

Letters: S, A, L, T, Y — all distinct and common except Y maybe.

We can also do: SALSA? duplicates S and A.

So distinct is better.

Therefore, my next guess will be SALTY.

So after thinking, I choose SALTY.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)), we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position.
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- Therefore, the next guess must include A (in any position except the third) and exclude C, R, N, E.
- The word should use new common letters to maximize information gain, such as S, T, L, and avoid repeated letters if possible.

After evaluating options:
- ""salty"" includes A (in the second position) and avoids C, R, N, E. It uses common consonants S, T, L and adds Y for coverage.
- This choice tests letters that haven't been used and positions A in a new location (position 2) to gather feedback on both the presence and positioning of A and other letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word, but not at position 3.
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: salty -> Feedback: S(x), A(-), L(-), T(x), Y(x)
Meaning:
- A is again marked as misplaced, so it must be in the word but not at position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 here).
- L is in the word but not at position 3.
- S, T, Y are not in the word.

Combining both feedbacks:

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, T, Y (7 letters absent).
Present letters: A (misplaced in both guesses) and L (misplaced in guess 2).

Since A was misplaced in position 3 (from guess 1) and now misplaced in position 2 (from guess 2), it must be in one of the other positions: 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly, L is present but not at position 3 (from this guess).

Also, note that L was guessed at position 3 in ""salty"", so it cannot be in position 3.

Now, we must include both A and L in our next guess, avoiding positions where they were previously misplaced, and avoiding the absent letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 4, or 5 (avoid position 2 and 3).

Possible positions for L: avoid position 3, so can be at 1,2,4,5.

But we need to choose a word that places A and L in positions that haven't been ruled out for them.

Additionally, we must not use C, R, N, E, S, T, Y.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, and also include known present letters A and L.

We should try to test new common letters.

Considering A in position 1: we can have words like A _ _ _ _
Or position 4: _ _ _ A _
Or position 5: _ _ _ _ A

With L somewhere not position 3 if it's in the same word? Actually, L can be in position 3? Wait, no: from guess 2, L was guessed at position 3 and was misplaced, so L is present but not at position 3. Therefore, in the next guess, we should avoid putting L at position 3.

Similarly, we cannot put A at position 2 or 3.

Therefore, when constructing the word, we must have A in 1,4, or 5 and L not in 3.

Also, no other absent letters.

Possible words:

First, try A in position 1: A _ _ _ _

Then L must be in 1,2,4,5 but cannot be at position 1 (since it would conflict?) Actually, if A is at 1, L can be at position 2,4,5.

We cannot have L at position 3.

So let's think of words starting with A and then L in other positions.

Option: A L _ _ _ but then A and L both at start? For example, ALIVE? But V? And E excluded? Invalid.

ALOUD: A,L,O,U,D -> A(1),L(2),O(3),U(4),D(5). But L is at position 2? That's fine? And position 3 is O. The issue: we know L is present, but we don't know if it's at position 2? We need feedback. Also, avoid E? Yes.

ALOUD: letters A,L,O,U,D. All allowed? Absent letters are C,R,N,E,S,T,Y so O,U,D are available.

So ""aloud"" is a valid word.

But L is at position 2: we have no feedback that L cannot be at position 2? Because in guess 2, L was at position 3 and was misplaced, but we know nothing about position 2 for L yet.

Similarly, A at position 1: we have not tried position 1 before.

So ""aloud"": A(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), D(5)

Check: Avoids C,R,N,E,S,T,Y? Yes.

Include both A and L? Yes.

Now, consider A in position 4: words where A is fourth, like ? ? ? A ?

For example, UMAMI? But duplicates and M? U(1),M(2),A(3)? Wait, A must be position 4? So like ? ? ? A something.

PLAZA? P,L,A,Z,A -> duplicates and Z uncommon? And A at position 4? PLAZA: P1,L2,A3,Z4 -> but we want A at position 4? So PLAZA would be P1,L2,A3,Z4, last A? Duplicate.

Difficult: GUAVA? duplicates and U,V? G1,U2,A3,V4,A5 -> again A not primarily at 4.

Position 4: Maybe a word like ""FOCAL"" but F,O,C,A,L -> C excluded? C is absent, invalid.

""MODAL"": M,O,D,A,L -> M(1),O(2),D(3),A(4),L(5). This avoids absent letters? C,R,N,E,S,T,Y? Yes? M,O,D,A,L all available.

And positions: A at position 4 (not 2 or 3), L at position 5 (not position 3). Good.

Also, distinct letters.

Position 5 for A: _ _ _ _ A

Words ending with A: like PIZZA? Duplicates.

MANIA? But E? No, MANIA: M,A,N,I,A -> N excluded? In guess 1 N was absent, yes. N is excluded? Guess 1: N(x) -> absent. So MANIA has N? Invalid.

CAMPA? Not word.

So challenging to find a word with A at 5 without using excluded letters.

""ULTRA""? Has R and U? R excluded? Yes, R is excluded.

Therefore, better candidates are ""aloud"" and ""modal"".

Compare:

1. ""aloud"": A at position 1 (new position for A), L at position 2 (new position for L). It tests A in first position, L in second, and adds O,U,D.

2. ""modal"": A at position 4 (new), L at position 5 (new). Tests M,O,D.

Which one covers more common letters? Both are reasonable.

Since A could be at position 1, which we haven't tested, let's try ""aloud"".

But note: if we guess ""aloud"", we put L at position 2. We don't know if L can be there or not. Similarly, in ""modal"", L is at position 5.

Another word: A in position 1 and L not at position 3: ""AUDIO"" -> A,U,D,I,O? BUT: AUDIO has U,D,I,O? And E excluded? Missing L? Must include L? We have to include L because we know it is in the word.

From guess 2, L is present. So yes, we must include L. Otherwise, we skip confirming L's position.

So both guesses must have A and L.

Therefore, another option: ""PLAID"" but P,L,A,I,D -> A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? And L at position 2? But ""PLAID"" has A in the third position, which we know is wrong? Because from guess 1, A was at position 3 and misplaced, so it cannot be position 3. So guessing A again at position 3 wouldn't help and wastes a position.

Therefore, avoid position 3 for A.

Similarly, one more word: ""VALID""? But V,A,L,I,D -> A at position 2? In guess 2 we put A at position 2 and it was misplaced? So we know A is not at position 2, so this would be invalid? We shouldn't put A at position 2 again? The feedback for ""salty"" had A at position 2 and was misplaced (marked '-'), which means it must be in the word elsewhere? So putting A at position 2 again would be inefficient? But possible? However, we can to force a feedback? But typically, we want new information.

So to maximize information, we should put A in a position we haven't tried: either 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly for L: haven't tried positions 1,2,4,5? But in ""aloud"" we try L at position 2.

How about L at position 1? Words starting with L: since A must be in 1,4,5, if L is at 1, then A cannot be at 1? Unless duplicate? But duplicate is possible? But we avoid.

So L at 1: then A at 4 or 5.

Example: ""LAPIS""? L,A,P,I,S -> but S excluded? Guess 2: S absent, invalid.

""LAMPS"" -> has S? Absent.

""LABOR"" -> R absent.

""LABIA"" -> duplicate A.

Not easy. So better to stick with ""aloud"" or ""modal"".

I think ""modal"" is also good because it tests different positions.

But let's list:

- ""aloud"": positions: A1, L2, O3, U4, D5
- ""modal"": positions: M1, O2, D3, A4, L5

Which one? Both test new letters.

We haven't tested position 3? In ""crane"" we had position 3 tested (A) and misplaced. In ""salty"", position 3 was L? and misplaced? So position 3 is incorrect for both A and L? But we don't know what letter is in position 3? It must be another letter.

In ""aloud"" we put O at position 3? That's fine, we can test O there? Similarly in ""modal"", we put O at position 2 and D at position 3? Also fine.

Perhaps ""modal"" avoids position 3 for vowels? But we need to test.

I think both are acceptable.

But ""aloud"" has a vowel U? Might be good.

But let me choose ""modal"" to test A at position 4 and L at position 5.

So guess: ""modal""

Letters: M,O,D,A,L — all distinct, avoids excluded letters, and places A and L in new positions.

Feedback will confirm or deny positions.

So I'll go with ""modal"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- From ""crane"": A is present but not in position 3; C, R, N, E are absent.
- From ""salty"": A is present but not in position 2; L is present but not in position 3; S, T, Y are absent.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, T, Y (7 letters).
- Present letters: A and L (confirmed mispositioned).
- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (positions not tested or ruled out).
- L must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (position 3 ruled out).

For this guess:
- Must include A and L (known present).
- Avoid absent letters.
- Prioritize testing A and L in new positions (A in 1/4/5, L not in 3) with new common letters to gather maximum information.
- Ideal candidate: ""modal"" (A in position 4, L in position 5; uses new letters M, O, D and avoids ruled positions/letters).

<guess>modal</guess>",modal,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word, but not at position 3.
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: salty -> Feedback: S(x), A(-), L(-), T(x), Y(x)
Meaning:
- A is again marked as misplaced, so it must be in the word but not at position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 here).
- L is in the word but not at position 3.
- S, T, Y are not in the word.

Combining both feedbacks:

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, T, Y (7 letters absent).
Present letters: A (misplaced in both guesses) and L (misplaced in guess 2).

Since A was misplaced in position 3 (from guess 1) and now misplaced in position 2 (from guess 2), it must be in one of the other positions: 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly, L is present but not at position 3 (from this guess).

Also, note that L was guessed at position 3 in ""salty"", so it cannot be in position 3.

Now, we must include both A and L in our next guess, avoiding positions where they were previously misplaced, and avoiding the absent letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 4, or 5 (avoid position 2 and 3).

Possible positions for L: avoid position 3, so can be at 1,2,4,5.

But we need to choose a word that places A and L in positions that haven't been ruled out for them.

Additionally, we must not use C, R, N, E, S, T, Y.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, and also include known present letters A and L.

We should try to test new common letters.

Considering A in position 1: we can have words like A _ _ _ _
Or position 4: _ _ _ A _
Or position 5: _ _ _ _ A

With L somewhere not position 3 if it's in the same word? Actually, L can be in position 3? Wait, no: from guess 2, L was guessed at position 3 and was misplaced, so L is present but not at position 3. Therefore, in the next guess, we should avoid putting L at position 3.

Similarly, we cannot put A at position 2 or 3.

Therefore, when constructing the word, we must have A in 1,4, or 5 and L not in 3.

Also, no other absent letters.

Possible words:

First, try A in position 1: A _ _ _ _

Then L must be in 1,2,4,5 but cannot be at position 1 (since it would conflict?) Actually, if A is at 1, L can be at position 2,4,5.

We cannot have L at position 3.

So let's think of words starting with A and then L in other positions.

Option: A L _ _ _ but then A and L both at start? For example, ALIVE? But V? And E excluded? Invalid.

ALOUD: A,L,O,U,D -> A(1),L(2),O(3),U(4),D(5). But L is at position 2? That's fine? And position 3 is O. The issue: we know L is present, but we don't know if it's at position 2? We need feedback. Also, avoid E? Yes.

ALOUD: letters A,L,O,U,D. All allowed? Absent letters are C,R,N,E,S,T,Y so O,U,D are available.

So ""aloud"" is a valid word.

But L is at position 2: we have no feedback that L cannot be at position 2? Because in guess 2, L was at position 3 and was misplaced, but we know nothing about position 2 for L yet.

Similarly, A at position 1: we have not tried position 1 before.

So ""aloud"": A(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), D(5)

Check: Avoids C,R,N,E,S,T,Y? Yes.

Include both A and L? Yes.

Now, consider A in position 4: words where A is fourth, like ? ? ? A ?

For example, UMAMI? But duplicates and M? U(1),M(2),A(3)? Wait, A must be position 4? So like ? ? ? A something.

PLAZA? P,L,A,Z,A -> duplicates and Z uncommon? And A at position 4? PLAZA: P1,L2,A3,Z4 -> but we want A at position 4? So PLAZA would be P1,L2,A3,Z4, last A? Duplicate.

Difficult: GUAVA? duplicates and U,V? G1,U2,A3,V4,A5 -> again A not primarily at 4.

Position 4: Maybe a word like ""FOCAL"" but F,O,C,A,L -> C excluded? C is absent, invalid.

""MODAL"": M,O,D,A,L -> M(1),O(2),D(3),A(4),L(5). This avoids absent letters? C,R,N,E,S,T,Y? Yes? M,O,D,A,L all available.

And positions: A at position 4 (not 2 or 3), L at position 5 (not position 3). Good.

Also, distinct letters.

Position 5 for A: _ _ _ _ A

Words ending with A: like PIZZA? Duplicates.

MANIA? But E? No, MANIA: M,A,N,I,A -> N excluded? In guess 1 N was absent, yes. N is excluded? Guess 1: N(x) -> absent. So MANIA has N? Invalid.

CAMPA? Not word.

So challenging to find a word with A at 5 without using excluded letters.

""ULTRA""? Has R and U? R excluded? Yes, R is excluded.

Therefore, better candidates are ""aloud"" and ""modal"".

Compare:

1. ""aloud"": A at position 1 (new position for A), L at position 2 (new position for L). It tests A in first position, L in second, and adds O,U,D.

2. ""modal"": A at position 4 (new), L at position 5 (new). Tests M,O,D.

Which one covers more common letters? Both are reasonable.

Since A could be at position 1, which we haven't tested, let's try ""aloud"".

But note: if we guess ""aloud"", we put L at position 2. We don't know if L can be there or not. Similarly, in ""modal"", L is at position 5.

Another word: A in position 1 and L not at position 3: ""AUDIO"" -> A,U,D,I,O? BUT: AUDIO has U,D,I,O? And E excluded? Missing L? Must include L? We have to include L because we know it is in the word.

From guess 2, L is present. So yes, we must include L. Otherwise, we skip confirming L's position.

So both guesses must have A and L.

Therefore, another option: ""PLAID"" but P,L,A,I,D -> A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? And L at position 2? But ""PLAID"" has A in the third position, which we know is wrong? Because from guess 1, A was at position 3 and misplaced, so it cannot be position 3. So guessing A again at position 3 wouldn't help and wastes a position.

Therefore, avoid position 3 for A.

""LAMPS"" -> has S? Absent.

""LABOR"" -> R absent.

""LABIA"" -> duplicate A.

Not easy. So better to stick with ""aloud"" or ""modal"".
