First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I don't have any information yet, I should choose a word that maximizes the potential information gain. This means I want a word with common letters that can help me narrow down possible words quickly.

A good starting word in Wordle often includes frequent letters like vowels and common consonants. Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include R, S, T, L, N, etc.

I recall that words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are popular starting words because they use several common letters.

Let me think about the English letter frequency. According to sources, the most common letters in 5-letter words might be E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

A word with multiple vowels and common consonants would be ideal. For example, ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E – all very common letters.

That's four vowels? R is a consonant, A and I are vowels, S is consonant, E is vowel. So: A, I, E (vowels) and R, S (consonants).

Another good one could be ""ALERT"" – A, L, E, R, T – again, common letters.

But I should choose something that balances vowels and consonants.

I think ""CRANE"" is often used: C, R, A, N, E – two vowels (A, E) and three consonants, including common ones.

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – S, L, T are common consonants, A and E are vowels.

""ROATE"" is another one, but I'm not sure if it's a valid word. Better to stick with common words.

I need to ensure my guess is a valid English word.

Let me decide on one.

Perhaps ""IMAGE"" but that has M and G, which are less common.

""AUDIO"" has many vowels but might miss some consonants.

But for the first guess, it's fine.

I think for this game, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a standard starting word.

It has C, R, A, N, E – all reasonably common.

Other options: ""PAINT"", ""HOUSE"", etc.

But I need to make a choice.

I'm thinking ""CRANE"".

The user didn't specify any restrictions, so I can choose any valid 5-letter word.

I'll proceed with ""CRANE"".

So, for the first guess, I'll guess ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the word
- R: x -> not in the word
- A: - -> in the word but wrong position
- N: x -> not in the word
- E: ✓ -> in the word and correct position

So we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.
2. The letter A is in the word but not in the third position (since in ""crane"" A is at position 3 and it's marked as wrong position). So A must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
3. The letters C, R, N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- E at the fifth position
- A somewhere but not at position 3 (so positions 1, 2, or 4)
- Does not contain C, R, N

We must guess another 5-letter word that meets these conditions.

Since E is fixed at the end, and A is present but not at position 3, we can choose a word that includes A and E, and avoids C, R, N.

Also, we want to guess words that have other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters not yet tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

We have positions: _ _ _ _ E

A can be in position 1, 2, or 4.

For the next guess, we can try a word that puts A in one of these positions and uses other common letters.

Possible words:
- If we put A at position 1: words like ""ABYSS"", ""ADOBE"", ""AFIRE"", ""AGAPE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AMUSE"", etc.
- If we put A at position 2: words like ""SAUTE"", ""PASTE"", ""TASTE"", ""HASTE""
- If we put A at position 4: words like ""PLACE"" (but C is not allowed, since C is x), so avoid C. ""BLADE"", ""SHADE"", ""GRADE"" (but R is forbidden), so we must avoid R.

We cannot use C, R, N.

Also, from the feedback, we know that A is present, so we must include A.

So let's think of words that end with E, contain A, and no C, R, N.

Example: ""SAUTE"" -> S, A, U, T, E. This has A at position 2 and E at the end.

But we don't know if S, U, T are in the word. This could be a good test.

Another: ""PASTE"" -> P, A, S, T, E. Avoid? But R is forbidden, but P, S, T are new.

We have to check validity.

Alternatively, ""ALIVE"": A at position 1, then L, I, V, E. End with E. And avoids C, R, N.

Or ""AMUSE"": A, M, U, S, E.

But we might want a word that has more common consonants.

Another idea: since A is misplaced, and we have E fixed, try to put A in a different position than last time. Last time A was at position 3, so now try position 1 or 2 or 4.

Let me list possible words that come to mind: ""PLANE"" has N and we know N is out. Invalid.

""SHADE"": S, H, A, D, E. A at position 3? Wait, in ""shade"": S at1, H at2, A at3, D at4, E at5. But in feedback for ""crane"", A was marked as in word but wrong position and it was at position 3. So if A again at position 3, it would be same position? But the secret word might have A at position 3? No, because in the first guess, A was at position 3 and marked wrong position, meaning A cannot be at position 3 in the secret word.

Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 again.

So for ""shade"", A is at position 3 -> that is forbidden because the feedback told us A is not in position 3.

Therefore, we cannot put A at position 3 in our guess, as we know it's not the case.

Actually, we can put A anywhere, but we know that in the secret word it is not at 3, so if we put it at 3 again, it will be marked wrong position again, and we won't learn new information about its position. Better to put it elsewhere to test.

So to find where A is, we should put A in a position we suspect: either 1, 2, or 4.

Similarly, we have other positions to fill.

Let me consider positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5=E.

We must include A in 1, 2, or 4.

And avoid C, R, N.

Possible words:

- A at position 1: e.g., ""AISLE"" -> but doesn't end with E? ""AISLE"" ends with E? Yes, A-I-S-L-E. Position 5 is E, good. Contains A, I, S, L, E. Avoids C,R,N.

- ""ADORE"" -> but R is forbidden. ""ADORE"" has R? A-D-O-R-E -> R at position 4, but R is x, so not allowed? Actually, we can guess with forbidden letters? But we know that R is not in the word, so if we guess a word with R, the feedback will show x for R and won't help us. So it's a wasted guess. So we should avoid letters that are known to be absent.

Therefore, avoid C, R, N.

So ""AISLE"" is valid: A, I, S, L, E. This would test A at 1 and E at 5. But E is already fixed.

How about ""ABIDE"": A-B-I-D-E -> contains B,I,D,E, avoids C,R,N.

Or ""ALIKE"": A-L-I-K-E, avoids C,R,N.

But we might want to cover more common letters.

Another approach: since E is fixed, and we know A is present, we can try to use common consonants in the other positions.

Common letters left: S, T, L, O, D, I, M, etc.

So a word with A in a new position and containing S, T, etc.

For example:
- A at position 2: words like ""BASIC"" has C, forbidden. ""BASED"" -> B-A-S-E-D? But E is at position 4, and we have E at position 5, so not helpful.

""GASTE"" is not a word.

""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E. H at1, A at2, S at3, T at4, E at5. So A is at position 2.

This seems good: contains A and E, avoids C,R,N, and tests H, S, T.

Similarly, ""PASTE"": P-A-S-T-E, same positions.

Which one is more common? ""HASTE"" or ""PASTE"" are both valid.

""SHADE"" but A is at position 3, and we know A cannot be at 3, so if we guess ""SHADE"", A is at 3 which we know is wrong, so the feedback for A will be '-' again, and we won't learn anything new about its position. To maximize information, we should put A in a position that could be correct: so either 1, 2, or 4.

Therefore, ""SHADE"" has A at position 3 -> not good because we want to test A at different positions.

Similarly, ""PLATE"" has L, A, T, E. But if A is at 3? ""PLATE"" is P-L-A-T-E: A at position 3. So position 3, which is invalid.

So we avoid that.

What about ""SLATE"": S-L-A-T-E -> A again at position 3. Same issue.

So we cannot use words with A at position 3.

Therefore, we look for words ending with E and having A at position 1, 2, or 4.

Position 4 examples: ""IMAGE"" has G, and A at position 4: I-M-A-G-E. Position 4 is A? Let's spell: I(1), M(2), A(3), G(4), E(5)? No, A is at position 3 in ""image"", same problem.

To have A at position 4: the fourth letter is A. For example, ""DELTA"" ends with A, not E.

""VISTA"" not E.

""CAFÉ"" is not 5 letters.

Actually, it's hard to find a common word with A at position 4 and E at 5.

Examples: ""AGAPE"" has A at both positions: A-G-A-P-E, positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:A, 4:P, 5:E. So A at 1 and 3. But position 3 is A? And we know A is not at position 3, so if we put A at position 3 again, it will be marked as wrong position. Also, we are testing two A's? That might be confusing.

Similarly, ""AROSE"": A not at 4. A-R-O-S-E, A at1, R is forbidden.

Perhaps ""BLADE"": B-L-A-D-E -> A at position 3, again.

It seems difficult to have A at position 4 with E at 5.

Maybe ""SOLVE""? No A.

Perhaps words with A at position 1 or 2 are easier.

Let me list:

Position 1: words like ""ABUSE"" - A-B-U-S-E, ends with E, avoids C,R,N. Letters: A, B, U, S, E. We test B, U, S.

Or ""ALIVE"" - A-L-I-V-E. Tests L, I, V.

Position 2: ""BASED"" but not common? ""BASED"" is B-A-S-E-D, but E is not at position 5? B(1), A(2), S(3), E(4), D(5). So E is at 4, which is not correct because in secret word E is at 5. So if we guess ""based"", the E would be at position 4, but we know E must be at 5? So the feedback for E in ""based"" would be '-' since it's in the word but wrong position? No, because the secret word has E at position 5, so if we put E at position 4, it is not E at 5, so if the letter is E, and it is in the word but not at position 4, it should be '-', since that position is wrong? Let's clarify.

The secret word has E at position 5. So if in a guess we have E at position 5, it would be ✓. If we have E at position 4, and the secret word has E at 5 (so not at 4), then the E we put at position 4 will be marked as '-' if there is another E elsewhere? But we don't know if there are multiple E's.

In the feedback rules:
- ✓: correct letter in correct position
- -: letter in the word but wrong position
- x: letter not in the word.

So for E: since we know it's at position 5, if we put E in another position, it could be '-' if there are multiple E's, or 'x' if not? But from the first guess, we only deduced that E is at position 5, but we don't know if there are other E's.

But the feedback for the first guess had E at position 5 as ✓, and no other E, so we only know that E is present and at position 5. It doesn't tell us if there are multiple E's.

Therefore, if in a new guess we put E at position 4, then:
- If the secret word has an E at position 4: ✓ for that position, but we know it can't be because from first guess, position 5 has E and if E were also at 4, it would have been detected? Not necessarily. The first guess only tested letters; it didn't have E at position 4, so it could be that there is an E at position 4 and position 5, meaning two E's.

But in ""crane"", we didn't have E at position 4, so we don't know if E is at position 4.

But we know E at position 5 exists.

So in a new guess, if we use E at position 4, and the secret word has E at position 5 (which it does), but not necessarily at position 4, then:
- The E at position 4 will be compared to the secret word:
  - If secret word has E at position 4, then ✓ (but it might, even if it has E at position 5)
  - If secret word does not have E at position 4 but has E elsewhere (like position 5), then E at position 4 will be marked as -
  - If no other E, but we know there is E at 5, so it must be marked as - for position 4

So specifically, since secret word has E at position 5, any E placed in a position other than 5 will be marked as '-' (because the letter is in the word but that position is wrong) unless that position also has E, which would then be ✓.

But we don't know about other positions.

To avoid complexity, for this guess, since we want to focus on finding A's position and other letters, perhaps we should not use positions that already have E. We can assume there's only one E for simplicity, but we don't know.

In ""crane"" we used one E at position 5 and got ✓, so E is at least at position 5.

For the next guess, if we oub an E at a different position, it might be marked '-' if there is another E, or 'x' if not.

But to keep it simple, maybe avoid using E in this guess unless at position 5.

But we can use E at position 5 again, which will be ✓ again, but we want to test other letters.

So in our guess, position 5 must be E because we know it's correct, so for each subsequent guess, we should keep E at position 5 until we know it changes, but we know it won't change.

Therefore, for all guesses, we should have position 5 as E.

The secret word ends with E, and we confirmed that with the first guess, so from now on, every guess should end with E.

So the format is: ? ? ? ? E

And we must include A somewhere in positions 1-4, but not at position 3 (because we know A is not at position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4).

So for position 4: the fourth letter could be A, but not position 3.

In positions 1,2,4 for A.

So for guess a word: _ _ _ _ E, with A in position 1,2, or 4, and no C,R,N.

Also, the letters in the other positions should be new common letters not used before: in ""crane"", we have C,R,A,N,E tested, but C,R,N are out, A and E are in with E correct position.

Letters not tested: all except C,R,A,N,E. So we should use new letters like S,T,L,I, etc.

possible words with A in position 1:   A ? ? ? E

Examples: ""ABOVE"", ""ABASE"", ""AGAPE"", ""ALIKE""

With A in position 2: ? A ? ? E

Examples: ""HASTE"", ""CASTE"" has C forbidden, ""PASTE"", ""BASED"" not 5 letters? ""basted"" is 6, ""BASTE"" is possible? B-A-S-T-E? Let's check: BASTE is a word meaning to sew loosely or to moisten. Valid.

Similarly, ""TASTE"", ""WASTE"".

With A in position 4: ? ? ? A E

But is there any common 5-letter word ending with ""AE""? Like ""AREAE"" not word. ""URAE"" not 5. It'a rare.

Common words: ""IDEA"" but 4 letters. ""FLEA"" 4 letters.

""PIECE"" no A.

It's difficult. The only possibility is words with A at position 4, but they might not exist or be common.

For example, ""QUAKE"" - Q-U-A-K-E: A is at position 3? Positions: Q1, U2, A3, K4, E5. So A is at position 3, which we cannot use.

""BLARE"" has R forbidden.

""STARE"" has R forbidden.

""AISLE"" - A-I-S-L-E: A at position 1, E at 5, positions: 1:A, 2:I, 3:S, 4:L, 5:E. This works, A at 1.

Similarly, ""ALIKE"" - A1, L2, I3, K4, E5.

""AMUSE"" - A1, M2, U3, S4, E5.

""ABUSE"" - A1, B2, U3, S4, E5.

Now for A at position 2: ""HASTE"" - H1, A2, S3, T4, E5.

""PASTE"" - P1, A2, S3, T4, E5.

""MAYBE"" but ends with E? M-A-Y-B-E, E at5, but Y and B, and A at2.

""RATIO"" not E.

So primary options: ""AISLE"" or ""ALIKE"" for A at1, or ""HASTE"" ""PASTE"" for A at2.

Which one to choose? We want to cover as many new common letters as possible.

With ""AISLE"": letters A, I, S, L, E. E is already known. A is known present. New: I, S, L.

With ""HASTE"": H, A, S, T, E. New: H, S, T.

S and T are very common.

Similarly, ""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E. New: P, S, T.

H and P are both common, but S and T are more common.

The word ""SLATE"" is common but has A at position 3, which we know is wrong, so we avoid it.

Now ""TABLE"" has T,A,B,L,E but A at position 2? T1, A2, B3, L4, E5. And avoids C,R,N. This is good. Letters: T, A, B, L, E. New letters: T, B, L.

Similarly, ""GABLE"" has G, etc.

But ""TABLE"" is a valid word.

So options:

- ""HASTE"": H, A, S, T, E → tests H, S, T

- ""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E → tests T, B, L

- ""AISLE"": A, I, S, L, E → tests I, S, L

I think ""HASTE"" or ""TABLE"" might be good.

But ""HASTE"" has S and T, both very common, while ""TABLE"" has B which is less common.

""PASTE"" has P, which is average.

Also, ""IMAGE"" has A at 3, avoid.

Perhaps ""SHAPE"" but has S,H,A,P,E. However, A is at position 3: S1, H2, A3, P4, E5. But position 3 is A, which we know is not correct, so if we guess ""SHAPE"", A at position 3 will be marked as '-' again, which we already know, so it doesn't give us new information about A's position.

Therefore, it's better to choose a guess where A is in a position that could be correct or not (positions 1, 2, or 4) so that the feedback can give us new information.

Since position 4 is rare, let's choose A at position 2 or 1.

I think ""HASTE"" is a good can  date: it puts A at position 2, and E at 5, and uses common letters H, S, T.

Guessing ""HASTE"" will test these letters.

So I'll go with ""HASTE"".

To confirm, feedback from first guess: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓)

Secret word has E at 5, A present not at 3, no C,R,N.

""HASTE"": H at1, A at2, S at3, T at4, E at5.

This is vali.

If I have the feedback for ""HASTE"", then:

- If A is at position 2 in secret word, it will be ✓, else if A is at another position, it will be '-' and we know from this.

Similarly for other letters.

So for maximum information, let's guess ""HASTE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess, ""CRANE"":  
- C (x): not in the word.  
- R (x): not in the word.  
- A (-): in the word but wrong position (cannot be position 3).  
- N (x): not in the word.  
- E (✓): in the word and correct position (position 5).  

### Deductions:  
1. The secret word ends with **E** (position 5).  
2. **A** is present but not at position 3, so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4.  
3. Letters **C, R, N** are absent and should be avoided.  
4. For the next guess:  
   - Position 5 must be **E**.  
   - **A** should be placed in a new position (1, 2, or 4) to test its location.  
   - Include new common letters like S, T, L, H to maximize information.  
   - Avoid using C, R, N.  

### Choice for Next Guess:  
A strong candidate is ""HASTE"":  
- It ends with **E**, satisfying position 5.  
- **A** is at position 2 (a potential correct spot).  
- New common letters tested: **H, S, T** (S and T are high-frequency).  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N).  
- Valid English word.  

If **A** is at position 2 in the secret word, it will be marked ✓; otherwise, the feedback may reveal its position. Letters **H**, **S**, and **T** will help identify other correct/misplaced letters.

<guess>haste</guess>",haste,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the word
- R: x -> not in the word
- A: - -> in the word but wrong position
- N: x -> not in the word
- E: ✓ -> in the word and correct position

So we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.
2. The letter A is in the word but not in the third position (since in ""crane"" A is at position 3 and it's marked as wrong position). So A must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
3. The letters C, R, N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- E at the fifth position
- A somewhere but not at position 3 (so positions 1, 2, or 4)
- Does not contain C, R, N

We must guess another 5-letter word that meets these conditions.

Since E is fixed at the end, and A is present but not at position 3, we can choose a word that includes A and E, and avoids C, R, N.

Also, we want to guess words that have other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters not yet tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

We have positions: _ _ _ _ E

A can be in position 1, 2, or 4.

For the next guess, we can try a word that puts A in one of these positions and uses other common letters.

Possible words:
- If we put A at position 1: words like ""ABYSS"", ""ADOBE"", ""AFIRE"", ""AGAPE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AMUSE"", etc.
- If we put A at position 2: words like ""SAUTE"", ""PASTE"", ""TASTE"", ""HASTE""
- If we put A at position 4: words like ""PLACE"" (but C is not allowed, since C is x), so avoid C. ""BLADE"", ""SHADE"", ""GRADE"" (but R is forbidden), so we must avoid R.

We cannot use C, R, N.

Also, from the feedback, we know that A is present, so we must include A.

So let's think of words that end with E, contain A, and no C, R, N.

Example: ""SAUTE"" -> S, A, U, T, E. This has A at position 2 and E at the end.

But we don't know if S, U, T are in the word. This could be a good test.

Another: ""PASTE"" -> P, A, S, T, E. Avoid? But R is forbidden, but P, S, T are new.

We have to check validity.

Alternatively, ""ALIVE"": A at position 1, then L, I, V, E. End with E. And avoids C, R, N.

Or ""AMUSE"": A, M, U, S, E.

But we might want a word that has more common consonants.

Another idea: since A is misplaced, and we have E fixed, try to put A in a different position than last time. Last time A was at position 3, so now try position 1 or 2 or 4.

Let me list possible words that come to mind: ""PLANE"" has N and we know N is out. Invalid.

""SHADE"": S, H, A, D, E. A at position 3? Wait, in ""shade"": S at1, H at2, A at3, D at4, E at5. But in feedback for ""crane"", A was marked as in word but wrong position and it was at position 3. So if A again at position 3, it would be same position? But the secret word might have A at position 3? No, because in the first guess, A was at position 3 and marked wrong position, meaning A cannot be at position 3 in the secret word.

Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 again.

So for ""shade"", A is at position 3 -> that is forbidden because the feedback told us A is not in position 3.

Therefore, we cannot put A at position 3 in our guess, as we know it's not the case.

Actually, we can put A anywhere, but we know that in the secret word it is not at 3, so if we put it at 3 again, it will be marked wrong position again, and we won't learn new information about its position. Better to put it elsewhere to test.

So to find where A is, we should put A in a position we suspect: either 1, 2, or 4.

Similarly, we have other positions to fill.

Let me consider positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5=E.

We must include A in 1, 2, or 4.

And avoid C, R, N.

Possible words:

- A at position 1: e.g., ""AISLE"" -> but doesn't end with E? ""AISLE"" ends with E? Yes, A-I-S-L-E. Position 5 is E, good. Contains A, I, S, L, E. Avoids C,R,N.

- ""ADORE"" -> but R is forbidden. ""ADORE"" has R? A-D-O-R-E -> R at position 4, but R is x, so not allowed? Actually, we can guess with forbidden letters? But we know that R is not in the word, so if we guess a word with R, the feedback will show x for R and won't help us. So it's a wasted guess. So we should avoid letters that are known to be absent.

Therefore, avoid C, R, N.

So ""AISLE"" is valid: A, I, S, L, E. This would test A at 1 and E at 5. But E is already fixed.

How about ""ABIDE"": A-B-I-D-E -> contains B,I,D,E, avoids C,R,N.

Or ""ALIKE"": A-L-I-K-E, avoids C,R,N.

But we might want to cover more common letters.

Another approach: since E is fixed, and we know A is present, we can try to use common consonants in the other positions.

Common letters left: S, T, L, O, D, I, M, etc.

So a word with A in a new position and containing S, T, etc.

For example:
- A at position 2: words like ""BASIC"" has C, forbidden. ""BASED"" -> B-A-S-E-D? But E is at position 4, and we have E at position 5, so not helpful.

""GASTE"" is not a word.

""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E. H at1, A at2, S at3, T at4, E at5. So A is at position 2.

This seems good: contains A and E, avoids C,R,N, and tests H, S, T.

Similarly, ""PASTE"": P-A-S-T-E, same positions.

Which one is more common? ""HASTE"" or ""PASTE"" are both valid.

""SHADE"" but A is at position 3, and we know A cannot be at 3, so if we guess ""SHADE"", A is at 3 which we know is wrong, so the feedback for A will be '-' again, and we won't learn anything new about its position. To maximize information, we should put A in a position that could be correct: so either 1, 2, or 4.

Therefore, ""SHADE"" has A at position 3 -> not good because we want to test A at different positions.

Similarly, ""PLATE"" has L, A, T, E. But if A is at 3? ""PLATE"" is P-L-A-T-E: A at position 3. So position 3, which is invalid.

So we avoid that.

What about ""SLATE"": S-L-A-T-E -> A again at position 3. Same issue.

So we cannot use words with A at position 3.

Therefore, we look for words ending with E and having A at position 1, 2, or 4.

Position 4 examples: ""IMAGE"" has G, and A at position 4: I-M-A-G-E. Position 4 is A? Let's spell: I(1), M(2), A(3), G(4), E(5)? No, A is at position 3 in ""image"", same problem.

To have A at position 4: the fourth letter is A. For example, ""DELTA"" ends with A, not E.

""VISTA"" not E.

""CAFÉ"" is not 5 letters.

Actually, it's hard to find a common word with A at position 4 and E at 5.

Examples: ""AGAPE"" has A at both positions: A-G-A-P-E, positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:A, 4:P, 5:E. So A at 1 and 3. But position 3 is A? And we know A is not at position 3, so if we put A at position 3 again, it will be marked as wrong position. Also, we are testing two A's? That might be confusing.

Similarly, ""AROSE"": A not at 4. A-R-O-S-E, A at1, R is forbidden.

Perhaps ""BLADE"": B-L-A-D-E -> A at position 3, again.

It seems difficult to have A at position 4 with E at 5.

Maybe ""SOLVE""? No A.

Perhaps words with A at position 1 or 2 are easier.

Let me list:

Position 1: words like ""ABUSE"" - A-B-U-S-E, ends with E, avoids C,R,N. Letters: A, B, U, S, E. We test B, U, S.

Or ""ALIVE"" - A-L-I-V-E. Tests L, I, V.

Position 2: ""BASED"" but not common? ""BASED"" is B-A-S-E-D, but E is not at position 5? B(1), A(2), S(3), E(4), D(5). So E is at 4, which is not correct because in secret word E is at 5. So if we guess ""based"", the E would be at position 4, but we know E must be at 5? So the feedback for E in ""based"" would be '-' since it's in the word but wrong position? No, because the secret word has E at position 5, so if we put E at position 4, it is not E at 5, so if the letter is E, and it is in the word but not at position 4, it should be '-', since that position is wrong? Let's clarify.

The secret word has E at position 5. So if in a guess we have E at position 5, it would be ✓. If we have E at position 4, and the secret word has E at 5 (so not at 4), then the E we put at position 4 will be marked as '-' if there is another E elsewhere? But we don't know if there are multiple E's.

In the feedback rules:
- ✓: correct letter in correct position
- -: letter in the word but wrong position
- x: letter not in the word.

So for E: since we know it's at position 5, if we put E in another position, it could be '-' if there are multiple E's, or 'x' if not? But from the first guess, we only deduced that E is at position 5, but we don't know if there are other E's.

But the feedback for the first guess had E at position 5 as ✓, and no other E, so we only know that E is present and at position 5. It doesn't tell us if there are multiple E's.

Therefore, if in a new guess we put E at position 4, then:
- If the secret word has an E at position 4: ✓ for that position, but we know it can't be because from first guess, position 5 has E and if E were also at 4, it would have been detected? Not necessarily. The first guess only tested letters; it didn't have E at position 4, so it could be that there is an E at position 4 and position 5, meaning two E's.

But in ""crane"", we didn't have E at position 4, so we don't know if E is at position 4.

But we know E at position 5 exists.

So in a new guess, if we use E at position 4, and the secret word has E at position 5 (which it does), but not necessarily at position 4, then:
- The E at position 4 will be compared to the secret word:
  - If secret word has E at position 4, then ✓ (but it might, even if it has E at position 5)
  - If secret word does not have E at position 4 but has E elsewhere (like position 5), then E at position 4 will be marked as -
  - If no other E, but we know there is E at 5, so it must be marked as - for position 4

So specifically, since secret word has E at position 5, any E placed in a position other than 5 will be marked as '-' (because the letter is in the word but that position is wrong) unless that position also has E, which would then be ✓.

But we don't know about other positions.

To avoid complexity, for this guess, since we want to focus on finding A's position and other letters, perhaps we should not use positions that already have E. We can assume there's only one E for simplicity, but we don't know.

In ""crane"" we used one E at position 5 and got ✓, so E is at least at position 5.

For the next guess, if we oub an E at a different position, it might be marked '-' if there is another E, or 'x' if not.

But to keep it simple, maybe avoid using E in this guess unless at position 5.

But we can use E at position 5 again, which will be ✓ again, but we want to test other letters.

So in our guess, position 5 must be E because we know it's correct, so for each subsequent guess, we should keep E at position 5 until we know it changes, but we know it won't change.

Therefore, for all guesses, we should have position 5 as E.

The secret word ends with E, and we confirmed that with the first guess, so from now on, every guess should end with E.

So the format is: ? ? ? ? E

And we must include A somewhere in positions 1-4, but not at position 3 (because we know A is not at position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4).

So for position 4: the fourth letter could be A, but not position 3.

In positions 1,2,4 for A.

So for guess a word: _ _ _ _ E, with A in position 1,2, or 4, and no C,R,N.

Also, the letters in the other positions should be new common letters not used before: in ""crane"", we have C,R,A,N,E tested, but C,R,N are out, A and E are in with E correct position.

Letters not tested: all except C,R,A,N,E. So we should use new letters like S,T,L,I, etc.

possible words with A in position 1:   A ? ? ? E

Examples: ""ABOVE"", ""ABASE"", ""AGAPE"", ""ALIKE""

With A in position 2: ? A ? ? E

Examples: ""HASTE"", ""CASTE"" has C forbidden, ""PASTE"", ""BASED"" not 5 letters? ""basted"" is 6, ""BASTE"" is possible? B-A-S-T-E? Let's check: BASTE is a word meaning to sew loosely or to moisten. Valid.

Similarly, ""TASTE"", ""WASTE"".

With A in position 4: ? ? ? A E

But is there any common 5-letter word ending with ""AE""? Like ""AREAE"" not word. ""URAE"" not 5. It'a rare.

Common words: ""IDEA"" but 4 letters. ""FLEA"" 4 letters.

""PIECE"" no A.

It's difficult. The only possibility is words with A at position 4, but they might not exist or be common.

For example, ""QUAKE"" - Q-U-A-K-E: A is at position 3? Positions: Q1, U2, A3, K4, E5. So A is at position 3, which we cannot use.

""BLARE"" has R forbidden.

""STARE"" has R forbidden.

""AISLE"" - A-I-S-L-E: A at position 1, E at 5, positions: 1:A, 2:I, 3:S, 4:L, 5:E. This works, A at 1.

Similarly, ""ALIKE"" - A1, L2, I3, K4, E5.

""AMUSE"" - A1, M2, U3, S4, E5.

""ABUSE"" - A1, B2, U3, S4, E5.

Now for A at position 2: ""HASTE"" - H1, A2, S3, T4, E5.

""PASTE"" - P1, A2, S3, T4, E5.

""MAYBE"" but ends with E? M-A-Y-B-E, E at5, but Y and B, and A at2.

""RATIO"" not E.

So primary options: ""AISLE"" or ""ALIKE"" for A at1, or ""HASTE"" ""PASTE"" for A at2.

Which one to choose? We want to cover as many new common letters as possible.

With ""AISLE"": letters A, I, S, L, E. E is already known. A is known present. New: I, S, L.

With ""HASTE"": H, A, S, T, E. New: H, S, T.

S and T are very common.

Similarly, ""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E. New: P, S, T.

H and P are both common, but S and T are more common.

The word ""SLATE"" is common but has A at position 3, which we know is wrong, so we avoid it.

Now ""TABLE"" has T,A,B,L,E but A at position 2? T1, A2, B3, L4, E5. And avoids C,R,N. This is good. Letters: T, A, B, L, E. New letters: T, B, L.

Similarly, ""GABLE"" has G, etc.

But ""TABLE"" is a valid word.

So options:

- ""HASTE"": H, A, S, T, E → tests H, S, T

- ""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E → tests T, B, L

- ""AISLE"": A, I, S, L, E → tests I, S, L

I think ""HASTE"" or ""TABLE"" might be good.

But ""HASTE"" has S and T, both very common, while ""TABLE"" has B which is less common.

""PASTE"" has P, which is average.

Also, ""IMAGE"" has A at 3, avoid.

Perhaps ""SHAPE"" but has S,H,A,P,E. However, A is at position 3: S1, H2, A3, P4, E5. But position 3 is A, which we know is not correct, so if we guess ""SHAPE"", A at position 3 will be marked as '-' again, which we already know, so it doesn't give us new information about A's position.

Therefore, it's better to choose a guess where A is in a position that could be correct or not (positions 1, 2, or 4) so that the feedback can give us new information.

Since position 4 is rare, let's choose A at position 2 or 1.

I think ""HASTE"" is a good can  date: it puts A at position 2, and E at 5, and uses common letters H, S, T.

Guessing ""HASTE"" will test these letters.

So I'll go with ""HASTE"".

To confirm, feedback from first guess: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓)

Secret word has E at 5, A present not at 3, no C,R,N.

""HASTE"": H at1, A at2, S at3, T at4, E at5.

This is vali.

If I have the feedback for ""HASTE"", then:

- If A is at position 2 in secret word, it will be ✓, else if A is at another position, it will be '-' and we know from this.

Similarly for other letters.

So for maximum information, let's guess ""HASTE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess, ""CRANE"":  
- C (x): not in the word.  
- R (x): not in the word.  
- A (-): in the word but wrong position (cannot be position 3).  
- N (x): not in the word.  
- E (✓): in the word and correct position (position 5).  

### Deductions:  
1. The secret word ends with **E** (position 5).  
2. **A** is present but not at position 3, so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4.  
3. Letters **C, R, N** are absent and should be avoided.  
4. For the next guess:  
   - Position 5 must be **E**.  
   - **A** should be placed in a new position (1, 2, or 4) to test its location.  
   - Include new common letters like S, T, L, H to maximize information.  
   - Avoid using C, R, N.  

### Choice for Next Guess:  
A strong candidate is ""HASTE"":  
- It ends with **E**, satisfying position 5.  
- **A** is at position 2 (a potential correct spot).  
- New common letters tested: **H, S, T** (S and T are high-frequency).  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N).  
- Valid English word.  

If **A** is at position 2 in the secret word, it will be marked ✓; otherwise, the feedback may reveal its position. Letters **H**, **S**, and **T** will help identify other correct/misplaced letters.",Guess 2: haste -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) A(✓) S(x) T(✓) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I don't have any information yet, I should choose a word that maximizes the potential information gain. This means I want a word with common letters that can help me narrow down possible words quickly.

A good starting word in Wordle often includes frequent letters like vowels and common consonants. Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include R, S, T, L, N, etc.

I recall that words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are popular starting words because they use several common letters.

Let me think about the English letter frequency. According to sources, the most common letters in 5-letter words might be E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

A word with multiple vowels and common consonants would be ideal. For example, ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E – all very common letters.

That's four vowels? R is a consonant, A and I are vowels, S is consonant, E is vowel. So: A, I, E (vowels) and R, S (consonants).

Another good one could be ""ALERT"" – A, L, E, R, T – again, common letters.

But I should choose something that balances vowels and consonants.

I think ""CRANE"" is often used: C, R, A, N, E – two vowels (A, E) and three consonants, including common ones.

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – S, L, T are common consonants, A and E are vowels.

""ROATE"" is another one, but I'm not sure if it's a valid word. Better to stick with common words.

I need to ensure my guess is a valid English word.

Let me decide on one.

Perhaps ""IMAGE"" but that has M and G, which are less common.

""AUDIO"" has many vowels but might miss some consonants.

But for the first guess, it's fine.

I think for this game, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a standard starting word.

It has C, R, A, N, E – all reasonably common.

Other options: ""PAINT"", ""HOUSE"", etc.

But I need to make a choice.

I'm thinking ""CRANE"".

The user didn't specify any restrictions, so I can choose any valid 5-letter word.

I'll proceed with ""CRANE"".

So, for the first guess, I'll guess ""CRANE"".I need to make the first guess without any prior information, so I should choose a word that includes common letters to maximize the chances of getting useful feedback. Common letters in English include vowels (like A, E, I, O) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, N). A good starting word often uses several of these to reveal letter positions or existence quickly.

After considering options like ""SLATE,"" ""ROAST,"" or ""CRANE,"" I select ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C, R, A, N, E – all common letters.
- Three consonants and two vowels (A and E), providing a balance.
- It's a valid English word, ensuring the guess is acceptable.

The feedback from this guess will help me identify correct positions, misplaced letters, or absent letters for the next move.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the word
- R: x -> not in the word
- A: - -> in the word but wrong position
- N: x -> not in the word
- E: ✓ -> in the word and correct position

So we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.
2. The letter A is in the word but not in the third position (since in ""crane"" A is at position 3 and it's marked as wrong position). So A must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
3. The letters C, R, N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- E at the fifth position
- A somewhere but not at position 3 (so positions 1, 2, or 4)
- Does not contain C, R, N

We must guess another 5-letter word that meets these conditions.

Since E is fixed at the end, and A is present but not at position 3, we can choose a word that includes A and E, and avoids C, R, N.

Also, we want to guess words that have other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters not yet tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

We have positions: _ _ _ _ E

A can be in position 1, 2, or 4.

For the next guess, we can try a word that puts A in one of these positions and uses other common letters.

Possible words:
- If we put A at position 1: words like ""ABYSS"", ""ADOBE"", ""AFIRE"", ""AGAPE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AMUSE"", etc.
- If we put A at position 2: words like ""SAUTE"", ""PASTE"", ""TASTE"", ""HASTE""
- If we put A at position 4: words like ""PLACE"" (but C is not allowed, since C is x), so avoid C. ""BLADE"", ""SHADE"", ""GRADE"" (but R is forbidden), so we must avoid R.

We cannot use C, R, N.

Also, from the feedback, we know that A is present, so we must include A.

So let's think of words that end with E, contain A, and no C, R, N.

Example: ""SAUTE"" -> S, A, U, T, E. This has A at position 2 and E at the end.

But we don't know if S, U, T are in the word. This could be a good test.

Another: ""PASTE"" -> P, A, S, T, E. Avoid? But R is forbidden, but P, S, T are new.

We have to check validity.

Alternatively, ""ALIVE"": A at position 1, then L, I, V, E. End with E. And avoids C, R, N.

Or ""AMUSE"": A, M, U, S, E.

But we might want a word that has more common consonants.

Another idea: since A is misplaced, and we have E fixed, try to put A in a different position than last time. Last time A was at position 3, so now try position 1 or 2 or 4.

Let me list possible words that come to mind: ""PLANE"" has N and we know N is out. Invalid.

""SHADE"": S, H, A, D, E. A at position 3? Wait, in ""shade"": S at1, H at2, A at3, D at4, E at5. But in feedback for ""crane"", A was marked as in word but wrong position and it was at position 3. So if A again at position 3, it would be same position? But the secret word might have A at position 3? No, because in the first guess, A was at position 3 and marked wrong position, meaning A cannot be at position 3 in the secret word.

Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 again.

So for ""shade"", A is at position 3 -> that is forbidden because the feedback told us A is not in position 3.

Therefore, we cannot put A at position 3 in our guess, as we know it's not the case.

Actually, we can put A anywhere, but we know that in the secret word it is not at 3, so if we put it at 3 again, it will be marked wrong position again, and we won't learn new information about its position. Better to put it elsewhere to test.

So to find where A is, we should put A in a position we suspect: either 1, 2, or 4.

Similarly, we have other positions to fill.

Let me consider positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5=E.

We must include A in 1, 2, or 4.

And avoid C, R, N.

Possible words:

- A at position 1: e.g., ""AISLE"" -> but doesn't end with E? ""AISLE"" ends with E? Yes, A-I-S-L-E. Position 5 is E, good. Contains A, I, S, L, E. Avoids C,R,N.

- ""ADORE"" -> but R is forbidden. ""ADORE"" has R? A-D-O-R-E -> R at position 4, but R is x, so not allowed? Actually, we can guess with forbidden letters? But we know that R is not in the word, so if we guess a word with R, the feedback will show x for R and won't help us. So it's a wasted guess. So we should avoid letters that are known to be absent.

Therefore, avoid C, R, N.

So ""AISLE"" is valid: A, I, S, L, E. This would test A at 1 and E at 5. But E is already fixed.

How about ""ABIDE"": A-B-I-D-E -> contains B,I,D,E, avoids C,R,N.

Or ""ALIKE"": A-L-I-K-E, avoids C,R,N.

But we might want to cover more common letters.

Another approach: since E is fixed, and we know A is present, we can try to use common consonants in the other positions.

Common letters left: S, T, L, O, D, I, M, etc.

So a word with A in a new position and containing S, T, etc.

For example:
- A at position 2: words like ""BASIC"" has C, forbidden. ""BASED"" -> B-A-S-E-D? But E is at position 4, and we have E at position 5, so not helpful.

""GASTE"" is not a word.

""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E. H at1, A at2, S at3, T at4, E at5. So A is at position 2.

This seems good: contains A and E, avoids C,R,N, and tests H, S, T.

Similarly, ""PASTE"": P-A-S-T-E, same positions.

Which one is more common? ""HASTE"" or ""PASTE"" are both valid.

""SHADE"" but A is at position 3, and we know A cannot be at 3, so if we guess ""SHADE"", A is at 3 which we know is wrong, so the feedback for A will be '-' again, and we won't learn anything new about its position. To maximize information, we should put A in a position that could be correct: so either 1, 2, or 4.

Therefore, ""SHADE"" has A at position 3 -> not good because we want to test A at different positions.

Similarly, ""PLATE"" has L, A, T, E. But if A is at 3? ""PLATE"" is P-L-A-T-E: A at position 3. So position 3, which is invalid.

So we avoid that.

What about ""SLATE"": S-L-A-T-E -> A again at position 3. Same issue.

So we cannot use words with A at position 3.

Therefore, we look for words ending with E and having A at position 1, 2, or 4.

Position 4 examples: ""IMAGE"" has G, and A at position 4: I-M-A-G-E. Position 4 is A? Let's spell: I(1), M(2), A(3), G(4), E(5)? No, A is at position 3 in ""image"", same problem.

To have A at position 4: the fourth letter is A. For example, ""DELTA"" ends with A, not E.

""VISTA"" not E.

""CAFÉ"" is not 5 letters.

Actually, it's hard to find a common word with A at position 4 and E at 5.

Examples: ""AGAPE"" has A at both positions: A-G-A-P-E, positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:A, 4:P, 5:E. So A at 1 and 3. But position 3 is A? And we know A is not at position 3, so if we put A at position 3 again, it will be marked as wrong position. Also, we are testing two A's? That might be confusing.

Similarly, ""AROSE"": A not at 4. A-R-O-S-E, A at1, R is forbidden.

Perhaps ""BLADE"": B-L-A-D-E -> A at position 3, again.

It seems difficult to have A at position 4 with E at 5.

Maybe ""SOLVE""? No A.

Perhaps words with A at position 1 or 2 are easier.

Let me list:

Position 1: words like ""ABUSE"" - A-B-U-S-E, ends with E, avoids C,R,N. Letters: A, B, U, S, E. We test B, U, S.

Or ""ALIVE"" - A-L-I-V-E. Tests L, I, V.

Position 2: ""BASED"" but not common? ""BASED"" is B-A-S-E-D, but E is not at position 5? B(1), A(2), S(3), E(4), D(5). So E is at 4, which is not correct because in secret word E is at 5. So if we guess ""based"", the E would be at position 4, but we know E must be at 5? So the feedback for E in ""based"" would be '-' since it's in the word but wrong position? No, because the secret word has E at position 5, so if we put E at position 4, it is not E at 5, so if the letter is E, and it is in the word but not at position 4, it should be '-', since that position is wrong? Let's clarify.

The secret word has E at position 5. So if in a guess we have E at position 5, it would be ✓. If we have E at position 4, and the secret word has E at 5 (so not at 4), then the E we put at position 4 will be marked as '-' if there is another E elsewhere? But we don't know if there are multiple E's.

In the feedback rules:
- ✓: correct letter in correct position
- -: letter in the word but wrong position
- x: letter not in the word.

So for E: since we know it's at position 5, if we put E in another position, it could be '-' if there are multiple E's, or 'x' if not? But from the first guess, we only deduced that E is at position 5, but we don't know if there are other E's.

But the feedback for the first guess had E at position 5 as ✓, and no other E, so we only know that E is present and at position 5. It doesn't tell us if there are multiple E's.

Therefore, if in a new guess we put E at position 4, then:
- If the secret word has an E at position 4: ✓ for that position, but we know it can't be because from first guess, position 5 has E and if E were also at 4, it would have been detected? Not necessarily. The first guess only tested letters; it didn't have E at position 4, so it could be that there is an E at position 4 and position 5, meaning two E's.

But in ""crane"", we didn't have E at position 4, so we don't know if E is at position 4.

But we know E at position 5 exists.

So in a new guess, if we use E at position 4, and the secret word has E at position 5 (which it does), but not necessarily at position 4, then:
- The E at position 4 will be compared to the secret word:
  - If secret word has E at position 4, then ✓ (but it might, even if it has E at position 5)
  - If secret word does not have E at position 4 but has E elsewhere (like position 5), then E at position 4 will be marked as -
  - If no other E, but we know there is E at 5, so it must be marked as - for position 4

So specifically, since secret word has E at position 5, any E placed in a position other than 5 will be marked as '-' (because the letter is in the word but that position is wrong) unless that position also has E, which would then be ✓.

But we don't know about other positions.

To avoid complexity, for this guess, since we want to focus on finding A's position and other letters, perhaps we should not use positions that already have E. We can assume there's only one E for simplicity, but we don't know.

In ""crane"" we used one E at position 5 and got ✓, so E is at least at position 5.

For the next guess, if we oub an E at a different position, it might be marked '-' if there is another E, or 'x' if not.

But to keep it simple, maybe avoid using E in this guess unless at position 5.

But we can use E at position 5 again, which will be ✓ again, but we want to test other letters.

So in our guess, position 5 must be E because we know it's correct, so for each subsequent guess, we should keep E at position 5 until we know it changes, but we know it won't change.

Therefore, for all guesses, we should have position 5 as E.

The secret word ends with E, and we confirmed that with the first guess, so from now on, every guess should end with E.

So the format is: ? ? ? ? E

And we must include A somewhere in positions 1-4, but not at position 3 (because we know A is not at position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4).

So for position 4: the fourth letter could be A, but not position 3.

In positions 1,2,4 for A.

So for guess a word: _ _ _ _ E, with A in position 1,2, or 4, and no C,R,N.

Also, the letters in the other positions should be new common letters not used before: in ""crane"", we have C,R,A,N,E tested, but C,R,N are out, A and E are in with E correct position.

Letters not tested: all except C,R,A,N,E. So we should use new letters like S,T,L,I, etc.

possible words with A in position 1:   A ? ? ? E

Examples: ""ABOVE"", ""ABASE"", ""AGAPE"", ""ALIKE""

With A in position 2: ? A ? ? E

Examples: ""HASTE"", ""CASTE"" has C forbidden, ""PASTE"", ""BASED"" not 5 letters? ""basted"" is 6, ""BASTE"" is possible? B-A-S-T-E? Let's check: BASTE is a word meaning to sew loosely or to moisten. Valid.

Similarly, ""TASTE"", ""WASTE"".

With A in position 4: ? ? ? A E

But is there any common 5-letter word ending with ""AE""? Like ""AREAE"" not word. ""URAE"" not 5. It'a rare.

Common words: ""IDEA"" but 4 letters. ""FLEA"" 4 letters.

""PIECE"" no A.

It's difficult. The only possibility is words with A at position 4, but they might not exist or be common.

For example, ""QUAKE"" - Q-U-A-K-E: A is at position 3? Positions: Q1, U2, A3, K4, E5. So A is at position 3, which we cannot use.

""BLARE"" has R forbidden.

""STARE"" has R forbidden.

""AISLE"" - A-I-S-L-E: A at position 1, E at 5, positions: 1:A, 2:I, 3:S, 4:L, 5:E. This works, A at 1.

Similarly, ""ALIKE"" - A1, L2, I3, K4, E5.

""AMUSE"" - A1, M2, U3, S4, E5.

""ABUSE"" - A1, B2, U3, S4, E5.

Now for A at position 2: ""HASTE"" - H1, A2, S3, T4, E5.

""PASTE"" - P1, A2, S3, T4, E5.

""MAYBE"" but ends with E? M-A-Y-B-E, E at5, but Y and B, and A at2.

""RATIO"" not E.

So primary options: ""AISLE"" or ""ALIKE"" for A at1, or ""HASTE"" ""PASTE"" for A at2.

Which one to choose? We want to cover as many new common letters as possible.

With ""AISLE"": letters A, I, S, L, E. E is already known. A is known present. New: I, S, L.

With ""HASTE"": H, A, S, T, E. New: H, S, T.

S and T are very common.

Similarly, ""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E. New: P, S, T.

H and P are both common, but S and T are more common.

The word ""SLATE"" is common but has A at position 3, which we know is wrong, so we avoid it.

Now ""TABLE"" has T,A,B,L,E but A at position 2? T1, A2, B3, L4, E5. And avoids C,R,N. This is good. Letters: T, A, B, L, E. New letters: T, B, L.

Similarly, ""GABLE"" has G, etc.

But ""TABLE"" is a valid word.

So options:

- ""HASTE"": H, A, S, T, E → tests H, S, T

- ""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E → tests T, B, L

- ""AISLE"": A, I, S, L, E → tests I, S, L

I think ""HASTE"" or ""TABLE"" might be good.

But ""HASTE"" has S and T, both very common, while ""TABLE"" has B which is less common.

""PASTE"" has P, which is average.

Also, ""IMAGE"" has A at 3, avoid.

Perhaps ""SHAPE"" but has S,H,A,P,E. However, A is at position 3: S1, H2, A3, P4, E5. But position 3 is A, which we know is not correct, so if we guess ""SHAPE"", A at position 3 will be marked as '-' again, which we already know, so it doesn't give us new information about A's position.

Therefore, it's better to choose a guess where A is in a position that could be correct or not (positions 1, 2, or 4) so that the feedback can give us new information.

Since position 4 is rare, let's choose A at position 2 or 1.

I think ""HASTE"" is a good can  date: it puts A at position 2, and E at 5, and uses common letters H, S, T.

Guessing ""HASTE"" will test these letters.

So I'll go with ""HASTE"".

To confirm, feedback from first guess: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓)

Secret word has E at 5, A present not at 3, no C,R,N.

""HASTE"": H at1, A at2, S at3, T at4, E at5.

This is vali.

If I have the feedback for ""HASTE"", then:

- If A is at position 2 in secret word, it will be ✓, else if A is at another position, it will be '-' and we know from this.

Similarly for other letters.

So for maximum information, let's guess ""HASTE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess, ""CRANE"":  
- C (x): not in the word.  
- R (x): not in the word.  
- A (-): in the word but wrong position (cannot be position 3).  
- N (x): not in the word.  
- E (✓): in the word and correct position (position 5).  

### Deductions:  
1. The secret word ends with **E** (position 5).  
2. **A** is present but not at position 3, so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4.  
3. Letters **C, R, N** are absent and should be avoided.  
4. For the next guess:  
   - Position 5 must be **E**.  
   - **A** should be placed in a new position (1, 2, or 4) to test its location.  
   - Include new common letters like S, T, L, H to maximize information.  
   - Avoid using C, R, N.  

### Choice for Next Guess:  
A strong candidate is ""HASTE"":  
- It ends with **E**, satisfying position 5.  
- **A** is at position 2 (a potential correct spot).  
- New common letters tested: **H, S, T** (S and T are high-frequency).  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N).  
- Valid English word.  

If **A** is at position 2 in the secret word, it will be marked ✓; otherwise, the feedback may reveal its position. Letters **H**, **S**, and **T** will help identify other correct/misplaced letters.

The letters C, R, N are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- E at the fifth position\n- A somewhere but not at position 3 (so positions 1, 2, or 4)\n- Does not contain C, R, N\n\nWe must guess another 5-letter word that meets these conditions.\n\nSince E is fixed at the end, and A is present but not at position 3, we can choose a word that includes A and E, and avoids C, R, N.\n\nAlso, we want to guess words that have other common letters to maximize information.\n\nCommon letters not yet tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.\n\nWe have positions: _ _ _ _ E\n\nA can be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nFor the next guess, we can try a word that puts A in one of these positions and uses other common letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- If we put A at position 1: words like ""ABYSS"", ""ADOBE"", ""AFIRE"", ""AGAPE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AMUSE"", etc.\n- If we put A at position 2: words like ""SAUTE"", ""PASTE"", ""TASTE"", ""HASTE""\n- If we put A at position 4: words like ""PLACE"" (but C is not allowed, since C is x), so avoid C. ""BLADE"", ""SHADE"", ""GRADE"" (but R is forbidden), so we must avoid R.\n\nWe cannot use C, R, N.\n\nAlso, from the feedback, we know that A is present, so we must include A.\n\nSo let\'s think of words that end with E, contain A, and no C, R, N.\n\nExample: ""SAUTE"" -> S, A, U, T, E. This has A at position 2 and E at the end.\n\nBut we don\'t know if S, U, T are in the word. This could be a good test.\n\nAnother: ""PASTE"" -> P, A, S, T, E. Avoid? But R is forbidden, but P, S, T are new.\n\nWe have to check validity.\n\nAlternatively, ""ALIVE"": A at position 1, then L, I, V, E. End with E. And avoids C, R, N.\n\nOr ""AMUSE"": A, M, U, S, E.\n\nBut we might want a word that has more common consonants.\n\nAnother idea: since A is misplaced, and we have E fixed, try to put A in a different position than last time. Last time A was at position 3, so now try position 1 or 2 or 4.\n\nLet me list possible words that come to mind: ""PLANE"" has N and we know N is out. Invalid.\n\n""SHADE"": S, H, A, D, E. A at position 3? Wait, in ""shade"": S at1, H at2, A at3, D at4, E at5. But in feedback for ""crane"", A was marked as in word but wrong position and it was at position 3. So if A again at position 3, it would be same position? But the secret word might have A at position 3? No, because in the first guess, A was at position 3 and marked wrong position, meaning A cannot be at position 3 in the secret word.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 again.\n\nSo for ""shade"", A is at position 3 -> that is forbidden because the feedback told us A is not in position 3.\n\nTherefore, we cannot put A at position 3 in our guess, as we know it\'s not the case.\n\nActually, we can put A anywhere, but we know that in the secret word it is not at 3, so if we put it at 3 again, it will be marked wrong position again, and we won\'t learn new information about its position. Better to put it elsewhere to test.\n\nSo to find where A is, we should put A in a position we suspect: either 1, 2, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, we have other positions to fill.\n\nLet me consider positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5=E.\n\nWe must include A in 1, 2, or 4.\n\nAnd avoid C, R, N.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- A at position 1: e.g., ""AISLE"" -> but doesn\'t end with E? ""AISLE"" ends with E? Yes, A-I-S-L-E. Position 5 is E, good. Contains A, I, S, L, E. Avoids C,R,N.\n\n- ""ADORE"" -> but R is forbidden. ""ADORE"" has R? A-D-O-R-E -> R at position 4, but R is x, so not allowed? Actually, we can guess with forbidden letters? But we know that R is not in the word, so if we guess a word with R, the feedback will show x for R and won\'t help us. So it\'s a wasted guess. So we should avoid letters that are known to be absent.\n\nTherefore, avoid C, R, N.\n\nSo ""AISLE"" is valid: A, I, S, L, E. This would test A at 1 and E at 5. But E is already fixed.\n\nHow about ""ABIDE"": A-B-I-D-E -> contains B,I,D,E, avoids C,R,N.\n\nOr ""ALIKE"": A-L-I-K-E, avoids C,R,N.\n\nBut we might want to cover more common letters.\n\nAnother approach: since E is fixed, and we know A is present, we can try to use common consonants in the other positions.\n\nCommon letters left: S, T, L, O, D, I, M, etc.\n\nSo a word with A in a new position and containing S, T, etc.\n\nFor example:\n- A at position 2: words like ""BASIC"" has C, forbidden. ""BASED"" -> B-A-S-E-D? But E is at position 4, and we have E at position 5, so not helpful.\n\n""GASTE"" is not a word.\n\n""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E. H at1, A at2, S at3, T at4, E at5. So A is at position 2.\n\nThis seems good: contains A and E, avoids C,R,N, and tests H, S, T.\n\nSimilarly, ""PASTE"": P-A-S-T-E, same positions.\n\nWhich one is more common? ""HASTE"" or ""PASTE"" are both valid.\n\n""SHADE"" but A is at position 3, and we know A cannot be at 3, so if we guess ""SHADE"", A is at 3 which we know is wrong, so the feedback for A will be \'-\' again, and we won\'t learn anything new about its position. To maximize information, we should put A in a position that could be correct: so either 1, 2, or 4.\n\nTherefore, ""SHADE"" has A at position 3 -> not good because we want to test A at different positions.\n\nSimilarly, ""PLATE"" has L, A, T, E. But if A is at 3? ""PLATE"" is P-L-A-T-E: A at position 3. So position 3, which is invalid.\n\nSo we avoid that.\n\nWhat about ""SLATE"": S-L-A-T-E -> A again at position 3. Same issue.\n\nSo we cannot use words with A at position 3.\n\nTherefore, we look for words ending with E and having A at position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nPosition 4 examples: ""IMAGE"" has G, and A at position 4: I-M-A-G-E. Position 4 is A? Let\'s spell: I(1), M(2), A(3), G(4), E(5)? No, A is at position 3 in ""image"", same problem.\n\nTo have A at position 4: the fourth letter is A. For example, ""DELTA"" ends with A, not E.\n\n""VISTA"" not E.\n\n""CAFÉ"" is not 5 letters.\n\nActually, it\'s hard to find a common word with A at position 4 and E at 5.\n\nExamples: ""AGAPE"" has A at both positions: A-G-A-P-E, positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:A, 4:P, 5:E. So A at 1 and 3. But position 3 is A? And we know A is not at position 3, so if we put A at position 3 again, it will be marked as wrong position. Also, we are testing two A\'s? That might be confusing.\n\nSimilarly, ""AROSE"": A not at 4. A-R-O-S-E, A at1, R is forbidden.\n\nPerhaps ""BLADE"": B-L-A-D-E -> A at position 3, again.\n\nIt seems difficult to have A at position 4 with E at 5.\n\nMaybe ""SOLVE""? No A.\n\nPerhaps words with A at position 1 or 2 are easier.\n\nLet me list:\n\nPosition 1: words like ""ABUSE"" - A-B-U-S-E, ends with E, avoids C,R,N. Letters: A, B, U, S, E. We test B, U, S.\n\nOr ""ALIVE"" - A-L-I-V-E. Tests L, I, V.\n\nPosition 2: ""BASED"" but not common? ""BASED"" is B-A-S-E-D, but E is not at position 5? B(1), A(2), S(3), E(4), D(5). So E is at 4, which is not correct because in secret word E is at 5. So if we guess ""based"", the E would be at position 4, but we know E must be at 5? So the feedback for E in ""based"" would be \'-\' since it\'s in the word but wrong position? No, because the secret word has E at position 5, so if we put E at position 4, it is not E at 5, so if the letter is E, and it is in the word but not at position 4, it should be \'-\', since that position is wrong? Let\'s clarify.\n\nThe secret word has E at position 5. So if in a guess we have E at position 5, it would be ✓. If we have E at position 4, and the secret word has E at 5 (so not at 4), then the E we put at position 4 will be marked as \'-\' if there is another E elsewhere? But we don\'t know if there are multiple E\'s.\n\nIn the feedback rules:\n- ✓: correct letter in correct position\n- -: letter in the word but wrong position\n- x: letter not in the word.\n\nSo for E: since we know it\'s at position 5, if we put E in another position, it could be \'-\' if there are multiple E\'s, or \'x\' if not? But from the first guess, we only deduced that E is at position 5, but we don\'t know if there are other E\'s.\n\nBut the feedback for the first guess had E at position 5 as ✓, and no other E, so we only know that E is present and at position 5. It doesn\'t tell us if there are multiple E\'s.\n\nTherefore, if in a new guess we put E at position 4, then:\n- If the secret word has an E at position 4: ✓ for that position, but we know it can\'t be because from first guess, position 5 has E and if E were also at 4, it would have been detected? Not necessarily. The first guess only tested letters; it didn\'t have E at position 4, so it could be that there is an E at position 4 and position 5, meaning two E\'s.\n\nBut in ""crane"", we didn\'t have E at position 4, so we don\'t know if E is at position 4.\n\nBut we know E at position 5 exists.\n\nSo in a new guess, if we use E at position 4, and the secret word has E at position 5 (which it does), but not necessarily at position 4, then:\n- The E at position 4 will be compared to the secret word:\n  - If secret word has E at position 4, then ✓ (but it might, even if it has E at position 5)\n  - If secret word does not have E at position 4 but has E elsewhere (like position 5), then E at position 4 will be marked as -\n  - If no other E, but we know there is E at 5, so it must be marked as - for position 4\n\nSo specifically, since secret word has E at position 5, any E placed in a position other than 5 will be marked as \'-\' (because the letter is in the word but that position is wrong) unless that position also has E, which would then be ✓.\n\nBut we don\'t know about other positions.\n\nTo avoid complexity, for this guess, since we want to focus on finding A\'s position and other letters, perhaps we should not use positions that already have E. We can assume there\'s only one E for simplicity, but we don\'t know.\n\nIn ""crane"" we used one E at position 5 and got ✓, so E is at least at position 5.\n\nFor the next guess, if we oub an E at a different position, it might be marked \'-\' if there is another E, or \'x\' if not.\n\nBut to keep it simple, maybe avoid using E in this guess unless at position 5.\n\nBut we can use E at position 5 again, which will be ✓ again, but we want to test other letters.\n\nSo in our guess, position 5 must be E because we know it\'s correct, so for each subsequent guess, we should keep E at position 5 until we know it changes, but we know it won\'t change.\n\nTherefore, for all guesses, we should have position 5 as E.\n\nThe secret word ends with E, and we confirmed that with the first guess, so from now on, every guess should end with E.\n\nSo the format is: ? ? ? ? E\n\nAnd we must include A somewhere in positions 1-4, but not at position 3 (because we know A is not at position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4).\n\nSo for position 4: the fourth letter could be A, but not position 3.\n\nIn positions 1,2,4 for A.\n\nSo for guess a word: _ _ _ _ E, with A in position 1,2, or 4, and no C,R,N.\n\nAlso, the letters in the other positions should be new common letters not used before: in ""crane"", we have C,R,A,N,E tested, but C,R,N are out, A and E are in with E correct position.\n\nLetters not tested: all except C,R,A,N,E. So we should use new letters like S,T,L,I, etc.\n\npossible words with A in position 1:   A ? ? ? E\n\nExamples: ""ABOVE"", ""ABASE"", ""AGAPE"", ""ALIKE""\n\nWith A in position 2: ? A ? ? E\n\nExamples: ""HASTE"", ""CASTE"" has C forbidden, ""PASTE"", ""BASED"" not 5 letters? ""basted"" is 6, ""BASTE"" is possible? B-A-S-T-E? Let\'s check: BASTE is a word meaning to sew loosely or to moisten. Valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""TASTE"", ""WASTE"".\n\nWith A in position 4: ? ? ? A E\n\nBut is there any common 5-letter word ending with ""AE""? Like ""AREAE"" not word. ""URAE"" not 5. It\'a rare.\n\nCommon words: ""IDEA"" but 4 letters. ""FLEA"" 4 letters.\n\n""PIECE"" no A.\n\nIt\'s difficult. The only possibility is words with A at position 4, but they might not exist or be common.\n\nFor example, ""QUAKE"" - Q-U-A-K-E: A is at position 3? Positions: Q1, U2, A3, K4, E5. So A is at position 3, which we cannot use.\n\n""BLARE"" has R forbidden.\n\n""STARE"" has R forbidden.\n\n""AISLE"" - A-I-S-L-E: A at position 1, E at 5, positions: 1:A, 2:I, 3:S, 4:L, 5:E. This works, A at 1.\n\nSimilarly, ""ALIKE"" - A1, L2, I3, K4, E5.\n\n""AMUSE"" - A1, M2, U3, S4, E5.\n\n""ABUSE"" - A1, B2, U3, S4, E5.\n\nNow for A at position 2: ""HASTE"" - H1, A2, S3, T4, E5.\n\n""PASTE"" - P1, A2, S3, T4, E5.\n\n""MAYBE"" but ends with E? M-A-Y-B-E, E at5, but Y and B, and A at2.\n\n""RATIO"" not E.\n\nSo primary options: ""AISLE"" or ""ALIKE"" for A at1, or ""HASTE"" ""PASTE"" for A at2.\n\nWhich one to choose? We want to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nWith ""AISLE"": letters A, I, S, L, E. E is already known. A is known present. New: I, S, L.\n\nWith ""HASTE"": H, A, S, T, E. New: H, S, T.\n\nS and T are very common.\n\nSimilarly, ""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E. New: P, S, T.\n\nH and P are both common, but S and T are more common.\n\nThe word ""SLATE"" is common but has A at position 3, which we know is wrong, so we avoid it.\n\nNow ""TABLE"" has T,A,B,L,E but A at position 2? T1, A2, B3, L4, E5. And avoids C,R,N. This is good. Letters: T, A, B, L, E. New letters: T, B, L.\n\nSimilarly, ""GABLE"" has G, etc.\n\nBut ""TABLE"" is a valid word.\n\nSo options:\n\n- ""HASTE"": H, A, S, T, E → tests H, S, T\n\n- ""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E → tests T, B, L\n\n- ""AISLE"": A, I, S, L, E → tests I, S, L\n\nI think ""HASTE"" or ""TABLE"" might be good.\n\nBut ""HASTE"" has S and T, both very common, while ""TABLE"" has B which is less common.\n\n""PASTE"" has P, which is average.\n\nAlso, ""IMAGE"" has A at 3, avoid.\n\nPerhaps ""SHAPE"" but has S,H,A,P,E. However, A is at position 3: S1, H2, A3, P4, E5. But position 3 is A, which we know is not correct, so if we guess ""SHAPE"", A at position 3 will be marked as \'-\' again, which we already know, so it doesn\'t give us new information about A\'s position.\n\nTherefore, it\'s better to choose a guess where A is in a position that could be correct or not (positions 1, 2, or 4) so that the feedback can give us new information.\n\nSince position 4 is rare, let\'s choose A at position 2 or 1.\n\nI think ""HASTE"" is a good can  date: it puts A at position 2, and E at 5, and uses common letters H, S, T.\n\nGuessing ""HASTE"" will test these letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""HASTE"".\n\nTo confirm, feedback from first guess: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓)\n\nSecret word has E at 5, A present not at 3, no C,R,N.\n\n""HASTE"": H at1, A at2, S at3, T at4, E at5.\n\nThis is vali.\n\nIf I have the feedback for ""HASTE"", then:\n\n- If A is at position 2 in secret word, it will be ✓, else if A is at another position, it will be \'-\' and we know from this.\n\nSimilarly for other letters.\n\nSo for maximum information, let\'s guess ""HASTE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess, ""CRANE"":  \n- C (x): not in the word.  \n- R (x): not in the word.  \n- A (-): in the word but wrong position (cannot be position 3).  \n- N (x): not in the word.  \n- E (✓): in the word and correct position (position 5).  \n\n### Deductions:  \n1. The secret word ends with **E** (position 5).  \n2. **A** is present but not at position 3, so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4.  \n3. Letters **C, R, N** are absent and should be avoided.  \n4. For the next guess:  \n   - Position 5 must be **E**.  \n   - **A** should be placed in a new position (1, 2, or 4) to test its location.  \n   - Include new common letters like S, T, L, H to maximize information.  \n   - Avoid using C, R, N.  \n\n### Choice for Next Guess:  \nA strong candidate is ""HASTE"":  \n- It ends with **E**, satisfying position 5.  \n- **A** is at position 2 (a potential correct spot).  \n- New common letters tested: **H, S, T** (S and T are high-frequency).  \n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N).  \n- Valid English word.  \n\nIf **A** is at position 2 in the secret word, it will be marked ✓; otherwise, the feedback may reveal its position. Letters **H**, **S**, and **T** will help identify other correct/misplaced letters.\n\n<guess>haste</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: haste -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) A(✓) S(x) T(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:
Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
  Meaning: E is in the correct position (5). A is in the word but not at position 3. C, R, N are absent.

Guess 2: haste -> H(✓) A(✓) S(x) T(✓) E(✓)
  Meaning: H at position 1 is correct, A at position 2 is correct, T at position 4 is correct, E at position 5 is correct. S at position 3 is absent.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has letters: H (position 1), A (position 2), T (position 4), E (position 5).
- Only the third position is missing.
- S is absent (not in the word).

We also know from guess 1 that:
- C, R, N are absent.
- A was misplaced in position 3 initially, but now we have it correct at position 2, so that is resolved.

The secret word is of the form: H A _ T E

We only need to find the middle letter (position 3) that is not S (since S is x) and not C, R, N (from first guess).

We must choose a word that fits the pattern H A ? T E, and ? is a letter that is not S, C, R, N.

Additionally, the word must be a valid English 5-letter word.

Possible words: ""HATE? No, we have position 4 as T, so ""HATE"" would be H A T E but only 4 letters. We need 5 letters: positions 1:H, 2:A, 3:?, 4:T, 5:E.

Common words:
- ""HALTE"" is not a common English word.
- ""HASTE"" we already guessed, but S is at position 3 and we now know S is absent.
- Other possibilities: Let's think of letters that can go between A and T in this context.

Common English words with pattern H A _ T E:
- ""HALTE"": Not valid in English.
- ""HARTE"": Not common? Harte might be a surname or rare, but not a common word.
- ""HAUTE"": Yes, ""haute"" as in haute cuisine. Definition: high-class or high-fashion (French origin but used in English).

""HAUTE"" spells as H-A-U-T-E. Position 3 is U.

Other words? ""HATE"" is only 4 letters. ""HABIT"" does not end with E.

So, the word ""HAUTE"" fits: H(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5).

We need to verify that U is not forbidden. From previous feedback:
- C, R, N are absent (from guess 1).
- S is absent (from guess 2).

U has not been tested before, so it's possible.

Given the pattern H A _ T E, ""HAUTE"" is the most common English word that fits.

Therefore, we should guess ""HAUTE"". If it is correct, we win. If not, we learn that U is not the correct letter, and we can then try others.

But are there other common words? For example, ""HANCE"" doesn't match because it would be H A N C E, but we know N is absent? And position 4 is C, but we need T? No.

Similarly, ""HASTE"" we tried, and it had S at position 3, which is absent.

So, ""HAUTE"" is the prime candidate.

Thus, we guess ""HAUTE"".
</think>
From the cumulative feedback:
- **First guess (""crane""):**  
  - E is correct and in position 5.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - C, R, N are absent.  

- **Second guess (""haste""):**  
  - H is correct and in position 1.  
  - A is correct and in position 2.  
  - T is correct and in position 4.  
  - E is correct and in position 5 (reaffirmed).  
  - S is absent.  

### Deductions:
1. The secret word must be: **H A _ T E** (positions: 1=H, 2=A, 3=?, 4=T, 5=E).  
2. The missing letter is at position 3.  
3. Forbidden letters (absent): **C, R, N, S**.  
4. Position 3 must be a letter not yet tested or eliminated—common English letters like B, D, G, L, M, U, etc.  

A valid English word that fits ""H A _ T E"" with no forbidden letters is ""**HAUTE**"" (common term from French, meaning ""elegant"" or ""high-style""). This uses U in position 3, testing an unverified common letter.  

If correct, it will solve the word. If not, the feedback for U (✓, -, or x) will narrow options for the next guess.  

<guess>haute</guess>",haute,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 2: haste -> H(✓) A(✓) S(x) T(✓) E(✓)
  Meaning: H at position 1 is correct, A at position 2 is correct, T at position 4 is correct, E at position 5 is correct. S at position 3 is absent.

From this, we know:

1. The secret word must be: **H A _ T E** (positions: 1=H, 2=A, 3=?, 4=T, 5=E).  
2. The missing letter is at position 3.  
3. Forbidden letters (absent): **C, R, N, S**.  
4. Position 3 must be a letter not yet tested or eliminated—common English letters like B, D, G, L, M, U, etc.  

A valid English word that fits ""H A _ T E"" with no forbidden letters is ""**HAUTE**"" (common term from French, meaning ""elegant"" or ""high-style""). This uses U in position 3, testing an unverified common letter.  

If correct, it will solve the word. If not, the feedback for U (✓, -, or x) will narrow options for the next guess.",Guess 3: haute -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) A(✓) U(✓) T(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
