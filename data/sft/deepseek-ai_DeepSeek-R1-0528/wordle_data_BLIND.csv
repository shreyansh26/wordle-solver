Alright, let's start with my first guess in Wordle. Since I have no prior feedback or clues to work with, I need to select a word that maximizes the information I can gather. A good starting point should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. 

The word ""CRATE"" comes to mind. It includes common consonants like C, R, T and vowels A and E. Each letter is distinct, which avoids duplicates that could reduce the information gathered. By placing these common letters in various positions, I might get some hits or eliminations quickly. For example, C at the beginning could catch starters, while E at the end tests a frequent finisher.

Other options like ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"" are also valid first words, but ""CRATE"" feels equally balanced. If any of these letters are in the word, especially if they're correctly placed, it'll narrow down possibilities significantly. Otherwise, eliminating frequent letters helps too. So ""CRATE"" seems like a solid initial guess.
</think>
After considering common starting words in Wordle, I chose ""CRATE"" because it contains frequently used letters (C, R, A, T, E) and provides good coverage of vowels and consonants. Each letter is unique, ensuring efficient feedback to eliminate or confirm multiple possibilities early in the game.

We are given that the first guess ""crate"" resulted in all letters being incorrect (x). 
 This means that the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, T, or E.

 Therefore, we must choose a new 5-letter word that does not use any of these letters.

 We need to pick a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting some hits.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, A, T, E) might include: 
   S, O, L, I, N, D, U, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

 We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 A good candidate might be ""soupy"" but let's think of more common ones.

 Another idea: ""sound"" - but note that we have to avoid E (which is excluded) and D is still available.

 However, we must avoid E, so ""sound"" is acceptable? Let's check: S, O, U, N, D. None of these are in the excluded set (C,R,A,T,E). 

 But we can also consider ""pilot"" - P, I, L, O, T. But T is excluded (from the first feedback) so we cannot use T.

 Since T is excluded, we cannot use T. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, A, E.

 So let's list the available letters: 
   Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses common letters and has no repeated letters (to maximize information).

 Some good candidates:
   ""sound"" : S, O, U, N, D
   ""pound"" : P, O, U, N, D
   ""lions"" : L, I, O, N, S
   ""slimy"" : S, L, I, M, Y
   ""windy"" : W, I, N, D, Y

 However, note that we are only on the second guess, so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's choose ""sound"" because it uses S, O, U, N, D which are all common and distinct.

 Alternatively, ""pilot"" is not possible because of T. 

 Another candidate: ""sushi"" has repeated S, so less information.

 We'll go with ""sound"".

 But note: we must ensure it's a valid English word. Yes, ""sound"" is valid.

 So the next guess is ""sound"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"" where all letters (C, R, A, T, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. For the next guess, I need to avoid these letters entirely and prioritize common unused letters to maximize new information. 

I'll choose ""sound"" because it:
- Uses 5 new common letters (S, O, U, N, D)
- Avoids C, R, A, T, E
- Covers multiple vowels (O, U) and consonants (S, N, D)
- Is a valid English word

This should efficiently narrow down possibilities by testing high-frequency letters not yet attempted.

We are given:
- First guess ""crate"": all letters incorrect (C, R, A, T, E not in the word)
- Second guess ""sound"": feedback S(x) O(x) U(x) N(✓) D(✓)
This means:
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (specifically, the 4th letter because N is the 4th letter in ""sound"")
  - D is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter)
  - S, O, U are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
  - 4th letter: N
  - 5th letter: D
And it does not contain: C, R, A, T, E, S, O, U.

We also know from the first feedback that none of C, R, A, T, E are in the word.

So, the word is of the form: _ _ _ N D

We need to fill in the first three letters, avoiding the letters: C, R, A, T, E, S, O, U.

Available letters include: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (since N and D are used but we know their positions, so they can't be repeated unless allowed? But we don't know if repetition is allowed. Typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? But note the feedback: in ""sound"", both N and D were marked correct, but that doesn't preclude repetition. However, since they are in position 4 and 5, and we don't have any duplicates in our guess, we don't know.

But the feedback doesn't indicate any duplicate issues because we did not repeat letters. However, the secret word might have repeated letters? But let's stick to known: the first three letters must be from the available set and must form a valid English word.

We must avoid: C, R, A, T, E, S, O, U.

Now, we have 4th and 5th fixed: N and D.

So the word is: ?1 ?2 ?3 N D

We need a 5-letter word ending with ""ND"", and the first three letters being letters not in the forbidden set.

Given that, we can think of common words ending with ""ND"".

Examples: 
- BLIND: B, L, I ... but we must check if letters are allowed. B is available, L is available, I is available. And forbidden: none of these are forbidden? Forbidden are C,R,A,T,E,S,O,U. So B, L, I are okay.
  - But let's check ""blind"": B, L, I, N, D -> valid word. But does it avoid forbidden? Yes.
- BOUND: has O and U, which are forbidden, so no.
- FOUND: has O and U, forbidden.
- MOUND: has O and U, forbidden.
- POUND: has O and U, forbidden.
- ROUND: has O and U, and R is also forbidden.
- WIND: too short? Wait, 5 letters? ""wind"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.

Some 5-letter words ending with ""ND"": 
- BLIND
- GRAND: but G is available, R is forbidden? R is forbidden (from crate: R(x)), so GRAND has R -> invalid.
- BRAND: B, R, A, N, D -> R and A are forbidden -> invalid.
- LAND: only 4 letters.
- STAND: S is forbidden (from sound: S(x)), and T is forbidden -> invalid.
- BEND: has E, forbidden -> invalid.
- SEND: S and E forbidden -> invalid.
- MIND: 4 letters.
- REMIND: too long? 6 letters.

Looking at: BLIND, and then also:
- FLYND: not common, probably not a word.
- LYAND: not a word.

Another: BLEND: but E is forbidden -> invalid.

So BLIND seems like a candidate.

But are there others? 
- FIELD: ends with LD, not ND.
- CHILD: ends with LD.

We need words ending specifically with ""ND"".

Another common one: ""MUND"" not English.

Perhaps ""LYND"" not common.

Let's think: We have:
- BLIND: B, L, I, N, D -> L and I are available? Yes. And B is available.

But let me list more words:
- GLYND: not a word.
- BAND: 4 letters? But 5-letter words: BRAND, GRAND but forbidden letters.

Another: ""BLAND"" but has A (forbidden) and L? Still, A is forbidden -> invalid.

""FOUND"" is invalid because of O and U.

""POUND"" same.

What about ""BOUND""? Same.

Perhaps less common? 

""KIND"" is 4 letters.

""UNBEND"" too long.

""REBIND"" too long and forbidden letters.

Perhaps ""BLIND"" is a good one? But let's see if there are other possibilities.

Also: 
- ""PLUND"" not a word.
- ""WIELD"" not ND.

Another idea: ""HOUND"" has O and U -> invalid.

""MOULD"" not ND.

Perhaps: ""BYND"" not a word.

Given the constraints, ""BLIND"" seems solid.

But let me confirm: 
- First three letters: B, L, I -> none in forbidden set (C,R,A,T,E,S,O,U).
- And it ends with ND.

But note: the first letter? We don't know.

Alternatively: we might have ""MYND"" but that's 4 letters.

""MINED"" ends with ED, but E is forbidden -> invalid.

Another 5-letter word: ""MOUND"" invalid because of O,U.

""ALIGN"" doesn't end with D.

Perhaps ""RESIN"" doesn't have D.

Wait, words ending with ND:

We can look for words with pattern: ??ND.

Since fourth and fifth are fixed, the word must be exactly the pattern: _ _ _ N D.

So:

- BLIND: positions:
  1: B
  2: L
  3: I
  4: N
  5: D

All good? But we don't have any feedback yet except that N and D are in place.

We haven't tested letters B, L, I yet. So they could be anywhere? But in BLIND, we are placing them.

But we should also consider that there might be other words. For example, ""FINAL"" doesn't end with D.

Another word: ""BLAND"" has A, forbidden -> invalid.

""GRIND"": G, R, I, N, D -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.

""PRINT"" doesn't end with D and T forbidden.

In fact, with the forbidden letters, the options are limited.

Another candidate: ""BLIND"" is one.

What about ""BUILD""? Doesn't end with ND.

""GUILD"" same.

Perhaps ""ELFIN"" no D.

Alternatively: ""LYNCH"" not D.

Maybe ""BONED"" has O and E -> invalid.

Given the constraints, ""BLIND"" is a strong candidate. We can use that.

But let me see: 
- Letter I is in position 3? We don't know if that's correct, but we need to test.

There is also ""BLOWN"" but doesn't end with D and has O -> invalid.

""FLOWN"" same.

Another possibility: ""MILKY"" not ending with D.

I think ""BLIND"" is a good guess.

But note: we should try to include more new letters? We haven't tested B, L, I. Since we are guessing BLIND, we are testing three new letters: B, L, I.

We could choose a word that has more common letters? But with the constraints, BLIND seems okay.

Are there other words? 

""BLINK"" doesn't end with D? It ends with K.

""CLINK"" has C -> invalid.

""FLING"" ends with G, not D.

""BLIMP"" no D.

So ""BLIND"" is good.

Another word: ""GYIND"" not a word.

""QUAND"" not a word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""BLIND"".

But we have two letters confirmed: 4th is N, 5th is D, so BLIND: B at 1, L at 2, I at 3, N at 4, D at 5.

We hope that B, L, I are not forbidden, which they aren't.

So let's guess ""BLIND"".
</think>
The previous feedback indicates:  
- **N** is in the correct position (4th letter).  
- **D** is in the correct position (5th letter).  
- **C, R, A, T, E, S, O, U** are absent from the secret word.  

Thus, the secret word ends with **""ND""** (e.g., \_ \_ \_ N D). Possible letters for the first three positions are limited to unused consonants and vowels (e.g., B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, W, Y).  

I selected **""blind""** because:  
- It tests three new, common letters: **B, L, I**.  
- It complies with the known constraints, avoiding forbidden letters.  
- It fits the common English word pattern ending with **""IND""**, a plausible match.  

This guess maximizes information gain by testing high-frequency letters in unresolved positions while adhering to the fixed 4th (N) and 5th (D) letters.

<guess>blind</guess>",blind,"We are given:
- First guess ""crate"": all letters incorrect (C, R, A, T, E not in the word)
- Second guess ""sound"": feedback S(x) O(x) U(x) N(✓) D(✓)
This means:
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (specifically, the 4th letter because N is the 4th letter in ""sound"")
  - D is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter)
  - S, O, U are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
  - 4th letter: N
  - 5th letter: D
And it does not contain: C, R, A, T, E, S, O, U.

We also know from the first feedback that none of C, R, A, T, E are in the word.

So, the word is of the form: _ _ _ N D

We need to fill in the first three letters, avoiding the letters: C, R, A, T, E, S, O, U.

Available letters include: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (since N and D are used but we know their positions, so they can't be repeated unless allowed? But we don't know if repetition is allowed. Typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? But note the feedback: in ""sound"", both N and D were marked correct, but that doesn't preclude repetition. However, since they are in position 4 and 5, and we don't have any duplicates in our guess, we don't know.

But the feedback doesn't indicate any duplicate issues because we did not repeat letters. However, the secret word might have repeated letters? But let's stick to known: the first three letters must be from the available set and must form a valid English word.

We must avoid: C, R, A, T, E, S, O, U.

Now, we have 4th and 5th fixed: N and D.

So the word is: ?1 ?2 ?3 N D

We need a 5-letter word ending with ""ND"", and the first three letters being letters not in the forbidden set.

Given that, we can think of common words ending with ""ND"".

Examples: 
- BLIND: B, L, I ... but we must check if letters are allowed. B is available, L is available, I is available. And forbidden: none of these are forbidden? Forbidden are C,R,A,T,E,S,O,U. So B, L, I are okay.
  - But let's check ""blind"": B, L, I, N, D -> valid word. But does it avoid forbidden? Yes.
- BOUND: has O and U, which are forbidden, so no.
- FOUND: has O and U, forbidden.
- MOUND: has O and U, forbidden.
- POUND: has O and U, forbidden.
- ROUND: has O and U, and R is also forbidden.
- WIND: too short? Wait, 5 letters? ""wind"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.

Some 5-letter words ending with ""ND"": 
- BLIND
- GRAND: but G is available, R is forbidden? R is forbidden (from crate: R(x)), so GRAND has R -> invalid.
- BRAND: B, R, A, N, D -> R and A are forbidden -> invalid.
- LAND: only 4 letters.
- STAND: S is forbidden (from sound: S(x)), and T is forbidden -> invalid.
- BEND: has E, forbidden -> invalid.
- SEND: S and E forbidden -> invalid.
- MIND: 4 letters.
- REMIND: too long? 6 letters.

Looking at: BLIND, and then also:
- FLYND: not common, probably not a word.
- LYAND: not a word.

Another: BLEND: but E is forbidden -> invalid.

So BLIND seems like a candidate.

But are there others? 
- FIELD: ends with LD, not ND.
- CHILD: ends with LD.

We need words ending specifically with ""ND"".

Another common one: ""MUND"" not English.

Perhaps ""LYND"" not common.

Let's think: We have:
