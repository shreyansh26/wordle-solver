We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E'
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N)
   - These letters are common in English words.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - The letter 'C' is correct and in the correct position (first position).
 - The letters 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
 - Starts with 'C'
 - Does not contain any of the letters: R, A, N, E.

 Since we know the first letter is 'C', and none of the other letters from ""crane"" (except C) are in the word, we must avoid using R, A, N, E in our next guess.

 Now, we need to choose a guess that:
 1. Starts with 'C'
 2. Does not contain R, A, N, E.
 3. Is a valid 5-letter English word.

 We can use other common letters to maximize information.

 Common letters not tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, X, Y, etc.

 We might want to include vowels that are still possible. The vowels we haven't used are: O, I, U (and sometimes Y). But note that the secret word might have repeated letters? However, since we have no indication of repetition, we can try to avoid it for now.

 Let's think of words starting with 'C' without R, A, N, E.

 Some possibilities:
 - ""CHIMP"" (but we must check if valid) -> not five distinct? Actually, it has 'C','H','I','M','P'. But note: we don't know if the word allows repeated letters, but the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates so far? Actually, our first guess didn't have duplicates and we got only one correct.

 However, the secret word might still have duplicates? But without feedback suggesting duplicates, we can assume for now that they are distinct until proven otherwise.

 Since we don't have any other information, let's try to cover more common consonants and vowels.

 Word: ""CHIPS"" -> letters: C, H, I, P, S -> no R,A,N,E -> valid.

 But note: we have feedback that only the first letter is correct. So the other four letters must be wrong. Therefore, we need to use letters that are still in the game.

 Another idea: include vowels that are likely. We haven't tested the vowel 'O' or 'I'. Also, the consonant 'S' or 'T' is common.

 Alternative words:
 - ""COULD"" -> but has 'U' and 'L', and also ends with 'D'. But we don't know about D? D is allowed since it wasn't excluded.
 - However, we don't know what positions are correct? Actually, we know only the first letter is correct. So in the next guess, we want to try different positions for the other letters to figure out which ones are in the word and at what positions.

 But note: we have excluded R,A,N,E. So the secret word must have four letters chosen from the remaining alphabet (without R,A,N,E) and must start with C.

 Considering common words that start with C and don't have R,A,N,E.

 Let me list some words:
 - ""CHALK"" -> but has A -> which is excluded -> invalid because A is out.
 - ""CLIMB"" -> C,L,I,M,B -> all allowed -> valid? word? ""CLIMB"" is a word.
 - ""COSTUME"" -> too long, must be 5 letters.
 - ""COILS"" -> has O,I,L,S -> but we don't know about these letters.

 However, we need to maximize information. We might want to include multiple new letters and avoid repeating the same ones?

 But we have only 6 tries. So we must balance between testing new letters and getting positional information.

 Since we know the first letter is C, we can focus on the rest.

 How about we choose a word that has as many common letters as possible from the remaining set?

 Remaining common consonants: S,T,L (common after R) and vowels: O,I.

 Consider: ""C"" -> then the next four letters: let's try ""O"" and then ""U"", but U is vowel? Alternatively, we can try:

 Word: ""COULD"" -> letters: C, O, U, L, D -> no R,A,N,E -> valid.
 Word: ""COILS"" -> C, O, I, L, S -> valid.

 Another: ""CHILL"" -> but has two L's, which might not give as much information? 
 We want distinct letters? Definitely for the next guess to get more information.

 Therefore, I consider ""COILS"":
   - It tests O (vowel) in second position, I in third, L in fourth, S in fifth.

 But note: we also know the secret word doesn't have A, R, N, E. So let's choose among:

 Alternatively, we can choose ""COULD"", but let me see if there's a word with more common letters? 

 Another candidate: ""COST"" -> too short? Wait, must be 5 letters: ""COSTS"" has repeated S -> not ideal. 
 ""CLOUD"" -> C,L,O,U,D -> valid, tests L, O, U, D.

 But we have only 5 letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 After excluding R,A,N,E, the alphabet left is: B,C,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z 
 But note: C is fixed at the start, so we don't need to test C again? Actually in different positions? But we know it's only at the start? Wait, the feedback showed that C is in correct position. But could the word have another C? The feedback didn't mark any letter as present in another position? But since we only have one C, the feedback would have shown '-' if there were two? However, we don't know if there is repetition? We need to consider: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But without evidence, we'll assume distinct until we see duplicated feedback.

 Therefore, for now, I'll choose a word with distinct letters that haven't been tried.

 One more candidate: ""CHIMP"" -> C,H,I,M,P -> valid. This uses H,I,M,P which are new.

 Which is better? ""COILS"" or ""CHIMP""?

 Both test 4 new letters. But ""CHIMP"" uses H,I,M,P and ""COILS"" uses O,I,L,S.

 Since we don't have information about any of them, both are fine. But we want to test vowels and consonants? We tested a vowel (A) in the first guess and it was absent. Now testing O and I? or I only? 

 Actually, the vowel in ""CHIMP"" is only I. In ""COILS"": O and I.

 We haven't tested O yet? So perhaps including O might be beneficial? But O is a vowel and common.

 However, note that the absence of A and E might make the word use O and I or U? 

 Since we are going for maximum coverage, let's pick ""COILS"": 
   Positions: 
     1: C (known correct, but we'll keep it)
     2: O -> if it's correct, we'll get a check; if present but wrong location, we get '-'; if absent, 'x'
     3: I -> same
     4: L -> same
     5: S -> same

 But we already know that the first letter is correct? Actually, in the feedback, we only got the first letter correct. So we know the second to fifth letters are not O, I, L, S? Wait, not necessarily. The other letters might be in the word but in different positions? However, note:

 Feedback told us that:
  C is correct in position 1 -> so position 1 is C.
  The other letters: R, A, N, E are not present at all -> so they are not in the word.

 Therefore, the secret word has these constraints:
  First letter: C
  The word does not contain: R, A, N, E
  The other four positions must be filled with letters from the remaining set.

 In the next guess, we are going to try: second position: O, third: I, fourth: L, fifth: S.

 However, it's possible that one or more of these letters is correct? For example, if the letter in position 2 is O, we'll get ✓ for O? but if the letter O is at another position? Then we get '-'.

 So we'll gain information.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""CHIMP"" which has H,I,M,P? Then we test H,I,M,P. But we are leaving S and T? 

 Since S and T are very common, maybe we should include one of them? 

 Consider the word ""CHOS? but not five letters -> ""CHOSM"" not a word. 

 What about ""CLOMP"" -> C,L,O,M,P -> valid? 

 But we haven't tested L? 

 Actually, we are constrained by which words exist. Let me think of common words:

 I think ""COILS"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to twist into spiral or rings? 

 Another option: ""COULD"" -> testing O,U,L,D? 

 The vowel U? We haven't tested U. 

 But among these, I think ""COILS"" is a good candidate because:
  - It tests two vowels: O and I (which are common) and two common consonants: L and S.

 However, note: we already know the secret word doesn't have A, E? Then the vowels must be among I, O, U? So testing O and I together might be efficient? 

 But we can test with ""COULD"" to test O and U? 

 Since the word must have 4 more letters (from the allowed set) and we don't know which vowels, we can choose either? 

 But we also want to cover common consonants? The consonant S is very common? So including S might be beneficial.

 Therefore, I lean towards ""COILS"". 

 However, wait: let me check if ""COILS"" is 5 distinct letters? Yes: C, O, I, L, S -> distinct except that C is at the start and we know it's fixed? So we are only testing O,I,L,S? 

 But note: we already know the first letter is C? Then if we put C at the start, we are not wasting an opportunity? Because we are confirming that? Actually, the word must start with C? So we can continue to use C at the beginning? 

 Maybe we can avoid using C? But then we wouldn't be able to test the other letters as well? Because if we don't put C at the start, we might get feedback that the C is elsewhere? But we already know from the first guess that C is at the start? Actually, no: in the first guess, we had C at the start and got a check? That means the secret word has C at the start. Therefore, if we use C again in the next guess? Then if we put C in another position, we'd expect an error? Actually, no: the secret word might have two C's? But we don't know? The feedback didn't show duplicate? 

 But let's look back at the first guess feedback: only the first C was marked as present? If the secret word had another C, it would have been marked with '-'? Because in the example: STORM -> feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not in position? 

 So in the first guess, we had:
    C: ✓ -> present at position 1
    R: x -> not present -> so if there was a C elsewhere? Then that would have been shown? Actually, we don't have duplicate C in the guess? 

 The guess ""crane"" has no duplicates? Therefore, we don't know the secret word has duplicate? But if there was a duplicate C in the secret word, we would see: in the feedback, one C would be marked as ✓ and the other as? We didn't have a second C? So we don't know? 

 Therefore, we might avoid using C again? But since we know that the first position is C, we are allowed to use C at the start? That doesn't hurt? Actually, we have to use C at the start? Because the word must start with C? 

 Actually, yes: because the first letter is C? So we must start with C? 

 Therefore, every guess we make from now on must start with C? Until we know otherwise? 

 That's true? Because if we guess a word that doesn't start with C, then we would get an 'x' for the first letter? But we know the secret word starts with C? So we should keep it? 

 Therefore, the second guess must start with C? 

 So my second guess will start with C? 

 Let me go with ""coils"" -> as we considered? 

 But let me validate: are there any other constraints? 

 Guess: ""coils"" -> C (first) -> which we know is correct? So we are using that.

 But I think I made a mistake: we know that the secret word has C in the first position? But does that mean any valid guess must start with C? It doesn't? We could guess a word not starting with C? Then the feedback would show x at the first? which we already know? So no harm? But we lose an opportunity to test other letters? 

 Actually, why would you test a word that doesn't start with C? Since the secret word starts with C? But we might test a word that has C elsewhere? Then we can see if there is another C? 

 However, that might be inefficient. 

 But note: if we guess a word that has C in another position? For example, if we guess ""STACK"" -> but then we use letters that are excluded? We cannot use A? 

 Actually, we have excluded R,A,N,E? So we must avoid them.

 If we avoid starting with C, then we can test other letters? But we will get an x in the first position? We already know that? 

 Actually, it might be beneficial? Because then we test a different pattern? 

 Let me reconsider: 

 Option 1: Start with C -> then we are guaranteed to get the first letter correct? And we test the remaining letters in the other positions? 

 Option 2: Don't start with C -> then we get x in first, and then we can test C in other positions? 

 However, the secret word starts with C? So if we test a word that has C in, say, position 2? Then the feedback:
   Position 1: x (because it's not C? but we know it's C? wait, but we didn't put C there) -> that's expected? 
   Position 2: if the letter is C? -> then we get '-': because the secret word has C at position 1? and we put C at position 2? So we get '-' meaning it is present but in the wrong position? But we already know it's at position 1? So we wouldn't get any new information? 

 Actually, we know the secret word has C at position 1? Therefore, if we put C elsewhere, we would get '-' for that position? But we already know that the C at the new position is not the same occurrence? So essentially, we are wasting a letter? 

 Therefore, it's better to keep C only at the first position? And use the other four positions to test new letters? 

 So we should start with C? 

 Then, our next guess must start with C? 

 So I choose: ""COILS""

 But let me write it in uppercase? However, the example used uppercase? 

 Actually, in the response we just use the word?

 So <guess>coils</guess>

 However, note: the feedback for the first guess: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) -> so we know:

   Correct: position 1 - C
   Absent: R, A, N, E

 Therefore, the word ""coils"" has:
   position 2: O -> not in the absent list? so allowed
   position 3: I -> not in the absent list -> allowed
   position 4: L -> allowed
   position 5: S -> allowed

 And it's a valid word? Yes.

 So we'll guess ""coils""

 But note: in the feedback, the word ""crane"" had all other letters absent? So the secret word does not have R,A,N,E? So ""coils"" uses none of them -> good.

<guess>coils</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- ""C"" is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word at all.

For the next guess:
- The word must start with ""C"" (since position 1 is confirmed).
- Avoid reusing letters ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" entirely.
- Aim to test new common consonants and vowels to gather maximum positional information.

Choosing ""COILS"":
- Tests ""O"" (vowel) at position 2, ""I"" (vowel) at position 3, ""L"" (common consonant) at position 4, and ""S"" (very common consonant) at position 5.
- All letters are distinct and avoid the excluded set (R,A,N,E).
- This combination efficiently probes multiple common letters not yet tried.

 One more candidate: ""CHIMP"" -> C,H,I,M,P -> valid. This uses H,I,M,P which are new.

 Which is better? ""COILS"" or ""CHIMP""?

 Both test 4 new letters. But ""CHIMP"" uses H,I,M,P and ""COILS"" uses O,I,L,S.

 Since we don't have information about any of them, both are fine. But we want to test vowels and consonants? We tested a vowel (A) in the first guess and it was absent. Now testing O and I? or I only? 

 Actually, the vowel in ""CHIMP"" is only I. In ""COILS"": O and I.

 We haven't tested O yet? So perhaps including O might be beneficial? But O is a vowel and common.

 However, note that the absence of A and E might make the word use O and I or U? 

 Since we are going for maximum coverage, let's pick ""COILS"": 
   Positions: 
     1: C (known correct, but we'll keep it)
     2: O -> if it's correct, we'll get a check; if present but wrong location, we get '-'; if absent, 'x'
     3: I -> same
     4: L -> same
     5: S -> same

 But we already know that the first letter is correct? Actually, in the feedback, we only got the first letter correct. So we know the second to fifth letters are not O, I, L, S? Wait, not necessarily. The other letters might be in the word but in different positions? However, note:

 Feedback told us that:
  C is correct in position 1 -> so position 1 is C.
  The other letters: R, A, N, E are not present at all -> so they are not in the word.

 Therefore, the secret word has these constraints:
  First letter: C
  The word does not contain: R, A, N, E
  The other four positions must be filled with letters from the remaining set.

 In the next guess, we are going to try: second position: O, third: I, fourth: L, fifth: S.

 However, it's possible that one or more of these letters is correct? For example, if the letter in position 2 is O, we'll get ✓ for O? but if the letter O is at another position? Then we get '-'.

 So we'll gain information.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""CHIMP"" which has H,I,M,P? Then we test H,I,M,P. But we are leaving S and T? 

 Since S and T are very common, maybe we should include one of them? 

 Consider the word ""CHOS? but not five letters -> ""CHOSM"" not a word. 

 What about ""CLOMP"" -> C,L,O,M,P -> valid? 

 But we haven't tested L? 

 Actually, we are constrained by which words exist. Let me think of common words:

 I think ""COILS"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to twist into spiral or rings? 

 Another option: ""COULD"" -> testing O,U,L,D? 

 The vowel U? We haven't tested U. 

 But among these, I think ""COILS"" is a good candidate because:
  - It tests two vowels: O and I (which are common) and two common consonants: L and S.

 However, note: we already know the secret word doesn't have A, E? Then the vowels must be among I, O, U? So testing O and I together might be efficient? 

 But we can test with ""COULD"" to test O and U? 

 Since the word must have 4 more letters (from the allowed set) and we don't know which vowels, we can choose either? 

 But we also want to cover common consonants? The consonant S is very common? So including S might be beneficial.

 Therefore, I lean towards ""COILS"". 

 However, wait: let me check if ""COILS"" is 5 distinct letters? Yes: C, O, I, L, S -> distinct except that C is at the start and we know it's fixed? So we are only testing O,I,L,S? 

 But note: we already know the first letter is C? Then if we put C at the start, we are not wasting an opportunity? Because we are confirming that? Actually, the word must start with C? So we can continue to use C at the beginning? 

 Maybe we can avoid using C? But then we wouldn't be able to test the other letters as well? Because if we don't put C at the start, we might get feedback that the C is elsewhere? But we already know from the first guess that C is at the start? Actually, no: in the first guess, we had C at the start and got a check? That means the secret word has C at the start. Therefore, if we use C again in the next guess? Then if we put C in another position, we'd expect an error? Actually, no: the secret word might have two C's? But we don't know? The feedback didn't show duplicate? 

 But let's look back at the first guess feedback: only the first C was marked as present? If the secret word had another C, it would have been marked with '-'? Because in the example: STORM -> feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not in position? 

 So in the first guess, we had:
    C: ✓ -> present at position 1
    R: x -> not present -> so if there was a C elsewhere? Then that would have been shown? Actually, we don't have duplicate C in the guess? 

 The guess ""crane"" has no duplicates? Therefore, we don't know the secret word has duplicate? But if there was a duplicate C in the secret word, we would see: in the feedback, one C would be marked as ✓ and the other as? We didn't have a second C? So we don't know? 

 Therefore, we might avoid using C again? But since we know that the first position is C, we are allowed to use C at the start? That doesn't hurt? Actually, we have to use C at the start? Because the word must start with C? 

 Actually, yes: because the first letter is C? So we must start with C? 

 Therefore, every guess we make from now on must start with C? Until we know otherwise? 

 That's true? Because if we guess a word that doesn't start with C, then we would get an 'x' for the first letter? But we know the secret word starts with C? So we should keep it? 

 Therefore, the second guess must start with C? 

 So my second guess will start with C? 

 Let me go with ""coils"" -> as we considered? 

 But let me validate: are there any other constraints? 

 Guess: ""coils"" -> C (first) -> which we know is correct? So we are using that.

 But I think I made a mistake: we know that the secret word has C in the first position? But does that mean any valid guess must start with C? It doesn't? We could guess a word not starting with C? Then the feedback would show x at the first? which we already know? So no harm? But we lose an opportunity to test other letters? 

 Actually, why would you test a word that doesn't start with C? Since the secret word starts with C? But we might test a word that has C elsewhere? Then we can see if there is another C? 

 However, that might be inefficient. 

 But note: if we guess a word that has C in another position? For example, if we guess ""STACK"" -> but then we use letters that are excluded? We cannot use A? 

 Actually, we have excluded R,A,N,E? So we must avoid them.

 If we avoid starting with C, then we can test other letters? But we will get an x in the first position? We already know that? 

 Actually, it might be beneficial? Because then we test a different pattern? 

 Let me reconsider: 

 Option 1: Start with C -> then we are guaranteed to get the first letter correct? And we test the remaining letters in the other positions? 

 Option 2: Don't start with C -> then we get x in first, and then we can test C in other positions? 

 However, the secret word starts with C? So if we test a word that has C in, say, position 2? Then the feedback:
   Position 1: x (because it's not C? but we know it's C? wait, but we didn't put C there) -> that's expected? 
   Position 2: if the letter is C? -> then we get '-': because the secret word has C at position 1? and we put C at position 2? So we get '-' meaning it is present but in the wrong position? But we already know it's at position 1? So we wouldn't get any new information? 

 Actually, we know the secret word has C at position 1? Therefore, if we put C elsewhere, we would get '-' for that position? But we already know that the C at the new position is not the same occurrence? So essentially, we are wasting a letter? 

 Therefore, it's better to keep C only at the first position? And use the other four positions to test new letters? 

 So we should start with C? 

 Then, our next guess must start with C? 

 So I choose: ""COILS""

 But let me write it in uppercase? However, the example used uppercase? 

 Actually, in the response we just use the word?

 So <guess>coils</guess>

 However, note: the feedback for the first guess: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) -> so we know:

   Correct: position 1 - C
   Absent: R, A, N, E

 Therefore, the word ""coils"" has:
   position 2: O -> not in the absent list? so allowed
   position 3: I -> not in the absent list -> allowed
   position 4: L -> allowed
   position 5: S -> allowed

 And it's a valid word? Yes.

 So we'll guess ""coils""

 But note: in the feedback, the word ""crane"" had all other letters absent? So the secret word does not have R,A,N,E? So ""coils"" uses none of them -> good.

<guess>coils</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- ""C"" is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word at all.

For the next guess:
- The word must start with ""C"" (since position 1 is confirmed).
- Avoid reusing letters ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" entirely.
- Aim to test new common consonants and vowels to gather maximum positional information.

Choosing ""COILS"":
- Tests ""O"" (vowel) at position 2, ""I"" (vowel) at position 3, ""L"" (common consonant) at position 4, and ""S"" (very common consonant) at position 5.
- All letters are distinct and avoid the excluded set (R,A,N,E).
- This combination efficiently probes multiple common letters not yet tried.",Guess 2: coils -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) I(x) L(-) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,CLUMP,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E'
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N)
   - These letters are common in English words.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - The letter 'C' is correct and in the correct position (first position).
 - The letters 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
 - Starts with 'C'
 - Does not contain any of the letters: R, A, N, E.

 Since we know the first letter is 'C', and none of the other letters from ""crane"" (except C) are in the word, we must avoid using R, A, N, E in our next guess.

 Now, we need to choose a guess that:
 1. Starts with 'C'
 2. Does not contain R, A, N, E.
 3. Is a valid 5-letter English word.

 We can use other common letters to maximize information.

 Common letters not tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, X, Y, etc.

 We might want to include vowels that are still possible. The vowels we haven't used are: O, I, U (and sometimes Y). But note that the secret word might have repeated letters? However, since we have no indication of repetition, we can try to avoid it for now.

 Let's think of words starting with 'C' without R, A, N, E.

 Some possibilities:
 - ""CHIMP"" (but we must check if valid) -> not five distinct? Actually, it has 'C','H','I','M','P'. But note: we don't know if the word allows repeated letters, but the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates so far? Actually, our first guess didn't have duplicates and we got only one correct.

 However, the secret word might still have duplicates? But without feedback suggesting duplicates, we can assume for now that they are distinct until proven otherwise.

 Since we don't have any other information, let's try to cover more common consonants and vowels.

 Word: ""CHIPS"" -> letters: C, H, I, P, S -> no R,A,N,E -> valid.

 But note: we have feedback that only the first letter is correct. So the other four letters must be wrong. Therefore, we need to use letters that are still in the game.

 Another idea: include vowels that are likely. We haven't tested the vowel 'O' or 'I'. Also, the consonant 'S' or 'T' is common.

 Alternative words:
 - ""COULD"" -> but has 'U' and 'L', and also ends with 'D'. But we don't know about D? D is allowed since it wasn't excluded.
 - However, we don't know what positions are correct? Actually, we know only the first letter is correct. So in the next guess, we want to try different positions for the other letters to figure out which ones are in the word and at what positions.

 But note: we have excluded R,A,N,E. So the secret word must have four letters chosen from the remaining alphabet (without R,A,N,E) and must start with C.

 Considering common words that start with C and don't have R,A,N,E.

 Let me list some words:
 - ""CHALK"" -> but has A -> which is excluded -> invalid because A is out.
 - ""CLIMB"" -> C,L,I,M,B -> all allowed -> valid? word? ""CLIMB"" is a word.
 - ""COSTUME"" -> too long, must be 5 letters.
 - ""COILS"" -> has O,I,L,S -> but we don't know about these letters.

 However, we need to maximize information. We might want to include multiple new letters and avoid repeating the same ones?

 But we have only 6 tries. So we must balance between testing new letters and getting positional information.

 Since we know the first letter is C, we can focus on the rest.

 How about we choose a word that has as many common letters as possible from the remaining set?

 Remaining common consonants: S,T,L (common after R) and vowels: O,I.

 Consider: ""C"" -> then the next four letters: let's try ""O"" and then ""U"", but U is vowel? Alternatively, we can try:

 Word: ""COULD"" -> letters: C, O, U, L, D -> no R,A,N,E -> valid.
 Word: ""COILS"" -> C, O, I, L, S -> valid.

 Another: ""CHILL"" -> but has two L's, which might not give as much information? 
 We want distinct letters? Definitely for the next guess to get more information.

 Therefore, I consider ""COILS"":
   - It tests O (vowel) in second position, I in third, L in fourth, S in fifth.

 But note: we also know the secret word doesn't have A, R, N, E. So let's choose among:

 Alternatively, we can choose ""COULD"", but let me see if there's a word with more common letters? 

 Another candidate: ""COST"" -> too short? Wait, must be 5 letters: ""COSTS"" has repeated S -> not ideal. 
 ""CLOUD"" -> C,L,O,U,D -> valid, tests L, O, U, D.

 But we have only 5 letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 After excluding R,A,N,E, the alphabet left is: B,C,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z 
 But note: C is fixed at the start, so we don't need to test C again? Actually in different positions? But we know it's only at the start? Wait, the feedback showed that C is in correct position. But could the word have another C? The feedback didn't mark any letter as present in another position? But since we only have one C, the feedback would have shown '-' if there were two? However, we don't know if there is repetition? We need to consider: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But without evidence, we'll assume distinct until we see duplicated feedback.

 Therefore, for now, I'll choose a word with distinct letters that haven't been tried.

 One more candidate: ""CHIMP"" -> C,H,I,M,P -> valid. This uses H,I,M,P which are new.

 Which is better? ""COILS"" or ""CHIMP""?

 Both test 4 new letters. But ""CHIMP"" uses H,I,M,P and ""COILS"" uses O,I,L,S.

 Since we don't have information about any of them, both are fine. But we want to test vowels and consonants? We tested a vowel (A) in the first guess and it was absent. Now testing O and I? or I only? 

 Actually, the vowel in ""CHIMP"" is only I. In ""COILS"": O and I.

 We haven't tested O yet? So perhaps including O might be beneficial? But O is a vowel and common.

 However, note that the absence of A and E might make the word use O and I or U? 

 Since we are going for maximum coverage, let's pick ""COILS"": 
   Positions: 
     1: C (known correct, but we'll keep it)
     2: O -> if it's correct, we'll get a check; if present but wrong location, we get '-'; if absent, 'x'
     3: I -> same
     4: L -> same
     5: S -> same

 But we already know that the first letter is correct? Actually, in the feedback, we only got the first letter correct. So we know the second to fifth letters are not O, I, L, S? Wait, not necessarily. The other letters might be in the word but in different positions? However, note:

 Feedback told us that:
  C is correct in position 1 -> so position 1 is C.
  The other letters: R, A, N, E are not present at all -> so they are not in the word.

 Therefore, the secret word has these constraints:
  First letter: C
  The word does not contain: R, A, N, E
  The other four positions must be filled with letters from the remaining set.

 In the next guess, we are going to try: second position: O, third: I, fourth: L, fifth: S.

 However, it's possible that one or more of these letters is correct? For example, if the letter in position 2 is O, we'll get ✓ for O? but if the letter O is at another position? Then we get '-'.

 So we'll gain information.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""CHIMP"" which has H,I,M,P? Then we test H,I,M,P. But we are leaving S and T? 

 Since S and T are very common, maybe we should include one of them? 

 Consider the word ""CHOS? but not five letters -> ""CHOSM"" not a word. 

 What about ""CLOMP"" -> C,L,O,M,P -> valid? 

 But we haven't tested L? 

 Actually, we are constrained by which words exist. Let me think of common words:

 I think ""COILS"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to twist into spiral or rings? 

 Another option: ""COULD"" -> testing O,U,L,D? 

 The vowel U? We haven't tested U. 

 But among these, I think ""COILS"" is a good candidate because:
  - It tests two vowels: O and I (which are common) and two common consonants: L and S.

 However, note: we already know the secret word doesn't have A, E? Then the vowels must be among I, O, U? So testing O and I together might be efficient? 

 But we can test with ""COULD"" to test O and U? 

 Since the word must have 4 more letters (from the allowed set) and we don't know which vowels, we can choose either? 

 But we also want to cover common consonants? The consonant S is very common? So including S might be beneficial.

 Therefore, I lean towards ""COILS"". 

 However, wait: let me check if ""COILS"" is 5 distinct letters? Yes: C, O, I, L, S -> distinct except that C is at the start and we know it's fixed? So we are only testing O,I,L,S? 

 But note: we already know the first letter is C? Then if we put C at the start, we are not wasting an opportunity? Because we are confirming that? Actually, the word must start with C? So we can continue to use C at the beginning? 

 Maybe we can avoid using C? But then we wouldn't be able to test the other letters as well? Because if we don't put C at the start, we might get feedback that the C is elsewhere? But we already know from the first guess that C is at the start? Actually, no: in the first guess, we had C at the start and got a check? That means the secret word has C at the start. Therefore, if we use C again in the next guess? Then if we put C in another position, we'd expect an error? Actually, no: the secret word might have two C's? But we don't know? The feedback didn't show duplicate? 

 But let's look back at the first guess feedback: only the first C was marked as present? If the secret word had another C, it would have been marked with '-'? Because in the example: STORM -> feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not in position? 

 So in the first guess, we had:
    C: ✓ -> present at position 1
    R: x -> not present -> so if there was a C elsewhere? Then that would have been shown? Actually, we don't have duplicate C in the guess? 

 The guess ""crane"" has no duplicates? Therefore, we don't know the secret word has duplicate? But if there was a duplicate C in the secret word, we would see: in the feedback, one C would be marked as ✓ and the other as? We didn't have a second C? So we don't know? 

 Therefore, we might avoid using C again? But since we know that the first position is C, we are allowed to use C at the start? That doesn't hurt? Actually, we have to use C at the start? Because the word must start with C? 

 Actually, yes: because the first letter is C? So we must start with C? 

 Therefore, every guess we make from now on must start with C? Until we know otherwise? 

 That's true? Because if we guess a word that doesn't start with C, then we would get an 'x' for the first letter? But we know the secret word starts with C? So we should keep it? 

 Therefore, the second guess must start with C? 

 So my second guess will start with C? 

 Let me go with ""coils"" -> as we considered? 

 But let me validate: are there any other constraints? 

 Guess: ""coils"" -> C (first) -> which we know is correct? So we are using that.

 But I think I made a mistake: we know that the secret word has C in the first position? But does that mean any valid guess must start with C? It doesn't? We could guess a word not starting with C? Then the feedback would show x at the first? which we already know? So no harm? But we lose an opportunity to test other letters? 

 Actually, why would you test a word that doesn't start with C? Since the secret word starts with C? But we might test a word that has C elsewhere? Then we can see if there is another C? 

 However, that might be inefficient. 

 But note: if we guess a word that has C in another position? For example, if we guess ""STACK"" -> but then we use letters that are excluded? We cannot use A? 

 Actually, we have excluded R,A,N,E? So we must avoid them.

 If we avoid starting with C, then we can test other letters? But we will get an x in the first position? We already know that? 

 Actually, it might be beneficial? Because then we test a different pattern? 

 Let me reconsider: 

 Option 1: Start with C -> then we are guaranteed to get the first letter correct? And we test the remaining letters in the other positions? 

 Option 2: Don't start with C -> then we get x in first, and then we can test C in other positions? 

 However, the secret word starts with C? So if we test a word that has C in, say, position 2? Then the feedback:
   Position 1: x (because it's not C? but we know it's C? wait, but we didn't put C there) -> that's expected? 
   Position 2: if the letter is C? -> then we get '-': because the secret word has C at position 1? and we put C at position 2? So we get '-' meaning it is present but in the wrong position? But we already know it's at position 1? So we wouldn't get any new information? 

 Actually, we know the secret word has C at position 1? Therefore, if we put C elsewhere, we would get '-' for that position? But we already know that the C at the new position is not the same occurrence? So essentially, we are wasting a letter? 

 Therefore, it's better to keep C only at the first position? And use the other four positions to test new letters? 

 So we should start with C? 

 Then, our next guess must start with C? 

 So I choose: ""COILS""

 But let me write it in uppercase? However, the example used uppercase? 

 Actually, in the response we just use the word?

 So <guess>coils</guess>

 However, note: the feedback for the first guess: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) -> so we know:

   Correct: position 1 - C
   Absent: R, A, N, E

 Therefore, the word ""coils"" has:
   position 2: O -> not in the absent list? so allowed
   position 3: I -> not in the absent list -> allowed
   position 4: L -> allowed
   position 5: S -> allowed

 And it's a valid word? Yes.

 So we'll guess ""coils""

 But note: in the feedback, the word ""crane"" had all other letters absent? So the secret word does not have R,A,N,E? So ""coils"" uses none of them -> good.

<guess>coils</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- ""C"" is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word at all.

For the next guess:
- The word must start with ""C"" (since position 1 is confirmed).
- Avoid reusing letters ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" entirely.
- Aim to test new common consonants and vowels to gather maximum positional information.

Choosing ""COILS"":
- Tests ""O"" (vowel) at position 2, ""I"" (vowel) at position 3, ""L"" (common consonant) at position 4, and ""S"" (very common consonant) at position 5.
- All letters are distinct and avoid the excluded set (R,A,N,E).
- This combination efficiently probes multiple common letters not yet tried.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.\n\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because:\n   - It has \'C\', \'R\', \'A\', \'N\', \'E\'\n   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N)\n   - These letters are common in English words.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane""\n Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n\n Interpretation:\n - The letter \'C\' is correct and in the correct position (first position).\n - The letters \'R\', \'A\', \'N\', \'E\' are not in the secret word at all.\n\n Therefore, the secret word:\n - Starts with \'C\'\n - Does not contain any of the letters: R, A, N, E.\n\n Since we know the first letter is \'C\', and none of the other letters from ""crane"" (except C) are in the word, we must avoid using R, A, N, E in our next guess.\n\n Now, we need to choose a guess that:\n 1. Starts with \'C\'\n 2. Does not contain R, A, N, E.\n 3. Is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n We can use other common letters to maximize information.\n\n Common letters not tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, X, Y, etc.\n\n We might want to include vowels that are still possible. The vowels we haven\'t used are: O, I, U (and sometimes Y). But note that the secret word might have repeated letters? However, since we have no indication of repetition, we can try to avoid it for now.\n\n Let\'s think of words starting with \'C\' without R, A, N, E.\n\n Some possibilities:\n - ""CHIMP"" (but we must check if valid) -> not five distinct? Actually, it has \'C\',\'H\',\'I\',\'M\',\'P\'. But note: we don\'t know if the word allows repeated letters, but the feedback didn\'t indicate any duplicates so far? Actually, our first guess didn\'t have duplicates and we got only one correct.\n\n However, the secret word might still have duplicates? But without feedback suggesting duplicates, we can assume for now that they are distinct until proven otherwise.\n\n Since we don\'t have any other information, let\'s try to cover more common consonants and vowels.\n\n Word: ""CHIPS"" -> letters: C, H, I, P, S -> no R,A,N,E -> valid.\n\n But note: we have feedback that only the first letter is correct. So the other four letters must be wrong. Therefore, we need to use letters that are still in the game.\n\n Another idea: include vowels that are likely. We haven\'t tested the vowel \'O\' or \'I\'. Also, the consonant \'S\' or \'T\' is common.\n\n Alternative words:\n - ""COULD"" -> but has \'U\' and \'L\', and also ends with \'D\'. But we don\'t know about D? D is allowed since it wasn\'t excluded.\n - However, we don\'t know what positions are correct? Actually, we know only the first letter is correct. So in the next guess, we want to try different positions for the other letters to figure out which ones are in the word and at what positions.\n\n But note: we have excluded R,A,N,E. So the secret word must have four letters chosen from the remaining alphabet (without R,A,N,E) and must start with C.\n\n Considering common words that start with C and don\'t have R,A,N,E.\n\n Let me list some words:\n - ""CHALK"" -> but has A -> which is excluded -> invalid because A is out.\n - ""CLIMB"" -> C,L,I,M,B -> all allowed -> valid? word? ""CLIMB"" is a word.\n - ""COSTUME"" -> too long, must be 5 letters.\n - ""COILS"" -> has O,I,L,S -> but we don\'t know about these letters.\n\n However, we need to maximize information. We might want to include multiple new letters and avoid repeating the same ones?\n\n But we have only 6 tries. So we must balance between testing new letters and getting positional information.\n\n Since we know the first letter is C, we can focus on the rest.\n\n How about we choose a word that has as many common letters as possible from the remaining set?\n\n Remaining common consonants: S,T,L (common after R) and vowels: O,I.\n\n Consider: ""C"" -> then the next four letters: let\'s try ""O"" and then ""U"", but U is vowel? Alternatively, we can try:\n\n Word: ""COULD"" -> letters: C, O, U, L, D -> no R,A,N,E -> valid.\n Word: ""COILS"" -> C, O, I, L, S -> valid.\n\n Another: ""CHILL"" -> but has two L\'s, which might not give as much information? \n We want distinct letters? Definitely for the next guess to get more information.\n\n Therefore, I consider ""COILS"":\n   - It tests O (vowel) in second position, I in third, L in fourth, S in fifth.\n\n But note: we also know the secret word doesn\'t have A, R, N, E. So let\'s choose among:\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""COULD"", but let me see if there\'s a word with more common letters? \n\n Another candidate: ""COST"" -> too short? Wait, must be 5 letters: ""COSTS"" has repeated S -> not ideal. \n ""CLOUD"" -> C,L,O,U,D -> valid, tests L, O, U, D.\n\n But we have only 5 letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n After excluding R,A,N,E, the alphabet left is: B,C,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z \n But note: C is fixed at the start, so we don\'t need to test C again? Actually in different positions? But we know it\'s only at the start? Wait, the feedback showed that C is in correct position. But could the word have another C? The feedback didn\'t mark any letter as present in another position? But since we only have one C, the feedback would have shown \'-\' if there were two? However, we don\'t know if there is repetition? We need to consider: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But without evidence, we\'ll assume distinct until we see duplicated feedback.\n\n Therefore, for now, I\'ll choose a word with distinct letters that haven\'t been tried.\n\n One more candidate: ""CHIMP"" -> C,H,I,M,P -> valid. This uses H,I,M,P which are new.\n\n Which is better? ""COILS"" or ""CHIMP""?\n\n Both test 4 new letters. But ""CHIMP"" uses H,I,M,P and ""COILS"" uses O,I,L,S.\n\n Since we don\'t have information about any of them, both are fine. But we want to test vowels and consonants? We tested a vowel (A) in the first guess and it was absent. Now testing O and I? or I only? \n\n Actually, the vowel in ""CHIMP"" is only I. In ""COILS"": O and I.\n\n We haven\'t tested O yet? So perhaps including O might be beneficial? But O is a vowel and common.\n\n However, note that the absence of A and E might make the word use O and I or U? \n\n Since we are going for maximum coverage, let\'s pick ""COILS"": \n   Positions: \n     1: C (known correct, but we\'ll keep it)\n     2: O -> if it\'s correct, we\'ll get a check; if present but wrong location, we get \'-\'; if absent, \'x\'\n     3: I -> same\n     4: L -> same\n     5: S -> same\n\n But we already know that the first letter is correct? Actually, in the feedback, we only got the first letter correct. So we know the second to fifth letters are not O, I, L, S? Wait, not necessarily. The other letters might be in the word but in different positions? However, note:\n\n Feedback told us that:\n  C is correct in position 1 -> so position 1 is C.\n  The other letters: R, A, N, E are not present at all -> so they are not in the word.\n\n Therefore, the secret word has these constraints:\n  First letter: C\n  The word does not contain: R, A, N, E\n  The other four positions must be filled with letters from the remaining set.\n\n In the next guess, we are going to try: second position: O, third: I, fourth: L, fifth: S.\n\n However, it\'s possible that one or more of these letters is correct? For example, if the letter in position 2 is O, we\'ll get ✓ for O? but if the letter O is at another position? Then we get \'-\'.\n\n So we\'ll gain information.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""CHIMP"" which has H,I,M,P? Then we test H,I,M,P. But we are leaving S and T? \n\n Since S and T are very common, maybe we should include one of them? \n\n Consider the word ""CHOS? but not five letters -> ""CHOSM"" not a word. \n\n What about ""CLOMP"" -> C,L,O,M,P -> valid? \n\n But we haven\'t tested L? \n\n Actually, we are constrained by which words exist. Let me think of common words:\n\n I think ""COILS"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to twist into spiral or rings? \n\n Another option: ""COULD"" -> testing O,U,L,D? \n\n The vowel U? We haven\'t tested U. \n\n But among these, I think ""COILS"" is a good candidate because:\n  - It tests two vowels: O and I (which are common) and two common consonants: L and S.\n\n However, note: we already know the secret word doesn\'t have A, E? Then the vowels must be among I, O, U? So testing O and I together might be efficient? \n\n But we can test with ""COULD"" to test O and U? \n\n Since the word must have 4 more letters (from the allowed set) and we don\'t know which vowels, we can choose either? \n\n But we also want to cover common consonants? The consonant S is very common? So including S might be beneficial.\n\n Therefore, I lean towards ""COILS"". \n\n However, wait: let me check if ""COILS"" is 5 distinct letters? Yes: C, O, I, L, S -> distinct except that C is at the start and we know it\'s fixed? So we are only testing O,I,L,S? \n\n But note: we already know the first letter is C? Then if we put C at the start, we are not wasting an opportunity? Because we are confirming that? Actually, the word must start with C? So we can continue to use C at the beginning? \n\n Maybe we can avoid using C? But then we wouldn\'t be able to test the other letters as well? Because if we don\'t put C at the start, we might get feedback that the C is elsewhere? But we already know from the first guess that C is at the start? Actually, no: in the first guess, we had C at the start and got a check? That means the secret word has C at the start. Therefore, if we use C again in the next guess? Then if we put C in another position, we\'d expect an error? Actually, no: the secret word might have two C\'s? But we don\'t know? The feedback didn\'t show duplicate? \n\n But let\'s look back at the first guess feedback: only the first C was marked as present? If the secret word had another C, it would have been marked with \'-\'? Because in the example: STORM -> feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not in position? \n\n So in the first guess, we had:\n    C: ✓ -> present at position 1\n    R: x -> not present -> so if there was a C elsewhere? Then that would have been shown? Actually, we don\'t have duplicate C in the guess? \n\n The guess ""crane"" has no duplicates? Therefore, we don\'t know the secret word has duplicate? But if there was a duplicate C in the secret word, we would see: in the feedback, one C would be marked as ✓ and the other as? We didn\'t have a second C? So we don\'t know? \n\n Therefore, we might avoid using C again? But since we know that the first position is C, we are allowed to use C at the start? That doesn\'t hurt? Actually, we have to use C at the start? Because the word must start with C? \n\n Actually, yes: because the first letter is C? So we must start with C? \n\n Therefore, every guess we make from now on must start with C? Until we know otherwise? \n\n That\'s true? Because if we guess a word that doesn\'t start with C, then we would get an \'x\' for the first letter? But we know the secret word starts with C? So we should keep it? \n\n Therefore, the second guess must start with C? \n\n So my second guess will start with C? \n\n Let me go with ""coils"" -> as we considered? \n\n But let me validate: are there any other constraints? \n\n Guess: ""coils"" -> C (first) -> which we know is correct? So we are using that.\n\n But I think I made a mistake: we know that the secret word has C in the first position? But does that mean any valid guess must start with C? It doesn\'t? We could guess a word not starting with C? Then the feedback would show x at the first? which we already know? So no harm? But we lose an opportunity to test other letters? \n\n Actually, why would you test a word that doesn\'t start with C? Since the secret word starts with C? But we might test a word that has C elsewhere? Then we can see if there is another C? \n\n However, that might be inefficient. \n\n But note: if we guess a word that has C in another position? For example, if we guess ""STACK"" -> but then we use letters that are excluded? We cannot use A? \n\n Actually, we have excluded R,A,N,E? So we must avoid them.\n\n If we avoid starting with C, then we can test other letters? But we will get an x in the first position? We already know that? \n\n Actually, it might be beneficial? Because then we test a different pattern? \n\n Let me reconsider: \n\n Option 1: Start with C -> then we are guaranteed to get the first letter correct? And we test the remaining letters in the other positions? \n\n Option 2: Don\'t start with C -> then we get x in first, and then we can test C in other positions? \n\n However, the secret word starts with C? So if we test a word that has C in, say, position 2? Then the feedback:\n   Position 1: x (because it\'s not C? but we know it\'s C? wait, but we didn\'t put C there) -> that\'s expected? \n   Position 2: if the letter is C? -> then we get \'-\': because the secret word has C at position 1? and we put C at position 2? So we get \'-\' meaning it is present but in the wrong position? But we already know it\'s at position 1? So we wouldn\'t get any new information? \n\n Actually, we know the secret word has C at position 1? Therefore, if we put C elsewhere, we would get \'-\' for that position? But we already know that the C at the new position is not the same occurrence? So essentially, we are wasting a letter? \n\n Therefore, it\'s better to keep C only at the first position? And use the other four positions to test new letters? \n\n So we should start with C? \n\n Then, our next guess must start with C? \n\n So I choose: ""COILS""\n\n But let me write it in uppercase? However, the example used uppercase? \n\n Actually, in the response we just use the word?\n\n So <guess>coils</guess>\n\n However, note: the feedback for the first guess: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) -> so we know:\n\n   Correct: position 1 - C\n   Absent: R, A, N, E\n\n Therefore, the word ""coils"" has:\n   position 2: O -> not in the absent list? so allowed\n   position 3: I -> not in the absent list -> allowed\n   position 4: L -> allowed\n   position 5: S -> allowed\n\n And it\'s a valid word? Yes.\n\n So we\'ll guess ""coils""\n\n But note: in the feedback, the word ""crane"" had all other letters absent? So the secret word does not have R,A,N,E? So ""coils"" uses none of them -> good.\n\n<guess>coils</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess:\n- ""C"" is correct and in the right position (position 1).\n- ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word at all.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must start with ""C"" (since position 1 is confirmed).\n- Avoid reusing letters ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" entirely.\n- Aim to test new common consonants and vowels to gather maximum positional information.\n\nChoosing ""COILS"":\n- Tests ""O"" (vowel) at position 2, ""I"" (vowel) at position 3, ""L"" (common consonant) at position 4, and ""S"" (very common consonant) at position 5.\n- All letters are distinct and avoid the excluded set (R,A,N,E).\n- This combination efficiently probes multiple common letters not yet tried.\n\n<guess>coils</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: coils -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) I(x) L(-) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- The first letter is 'C' and it is correct and in the correct position.
- The letters 'R', 'A', 'N', and 'E' are not in the secret word at all.

Guess 2: ""coils"" -> Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(x) L(-) S(x)
Meaning:
- The first letter 'C' is again correct (as we knew).
- The second letter 'O' is not in the word (x).
- The third letter 'I' is not in the word (x).
- The fourth letter 'L' is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- The fifth letter 'S' is not in the word (x).

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word starts with 'C'.
2. The secret word does not contain: R, A, N, E, O, I, S. (from the x's)
3. The secret word contains the letter 'L', but not in the fourth position.

Also, note that the letter 'L' is present but not in position 4. Since we have only one 'L' in the guess, we know there is at least one 'L' in the word, but it could be in position 1,2,3, or 5? But position 1 is already 'C', so it cannot be there. Therefore, the 'L' must be in position 2, 3, or 5? But wait, we have feedback that the second letter is not 'O' and it's absent, but that doesn't directly say about 'L' in position 2? Actually, we don't know about position 2 yet? The feedback for position 2 was for 'O' being absent, but that doesn't tell us about other letters.

However, we know that the secret word has an 'L' somewhere, but not in position 4. The possible positions for 'L' are 2, 3, or 5? But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence for that yet.

Now, let's list the constraints:

- Position 1: 'C'
- Positions 2,3,4,5: cannot be O, I, S (from the x's in guess2) and also cannot be R,A,N,E (from guess1). Also, the letter L is present but not in position 4.

So the absent letters are: R, A, N, E, O, I, S.

Therefore, the remaining letters that can be in the word are from the alphabet excluding: A, E, I, O, R, N, S.

The alphabet: A to Z, remove A, E, I, O, R, N, S -> remaining: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we already know the word has an 'L'. Also, the first letter is 'C', so we don't need to test that again? But we can use it? Actually, we must start with 'C'.

Now, the word must have an 'L' in one of the positions: 2, 3, or 5? (since position 4 is excluded by the feedback).

But note: position 5 was 'S' in guess2 and it was absent, so position 5 is not 'S', but it could be 'L'? Yes.

So possible positions for 'L': 2, 3, 5.

We also know that the secret word has exactly 5 letters, and we know one of them is 'L' (at least one) and the first is 'C'. The other three letters are from the remaining set.

We need to choose a new guess that:

- Starts with 'C'
- Does not use any of the absent letters: R,A,N,E,O,I,S
- Must include the letter 'L' (because we know it's in the word) and place it in a position that is not 4, and preferably in a position we haven't tested? We tested position 4 for L and it was wrong, so we can try position 2, 3, or 5.

But we also want to test other common letters to narrow down.

Common letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We already have L, so we need to test others.

We can try to put L in position 2? Because we haven't tested position 2 for L? We tested position 2 with O and it was absent, but that doesn't tell us about L.

Similarly, position 3 we tested with I and it was absent, and position 5 with S and absent.

So we can try L in position 2? Then we can test other letters in positions 3,4,5.

But note: we also need to consider that the word might have more than one of the remaining letters? We don't know.

Let's think of words that start with C, have an L in position 2, and use other allowed letters.

For example: ""CLUMP"" -> C, L, U, M, P -> all allowed? 
- U is allowed? Yes, not in the absent list.

But we don't know if U is in the word? We can test it.

Another: ""CLAMP"" -> but A is absent? A is in the absent list? Yes, so we cannot use A.

""CLAMP"" has A -> invalid.

""CLUMP"" is valid? Yes.

But we also have to avoid the absent letters.

Another: ""CLUB"" -> too short? Must be 5 letters: ""CLUBS"" -> but S is absent? S is in the absent list? Yes, so we cannot use S.

""CLUNG"" -> C,L,U,N,G -> but N is absent? N is in the absent list? Yes, from guess1.

So we cannot use N.

Therefore, ""CLUMP"" is: C,L,U,M,P -> all allowed? 
- C: allowed (but fixed at start)
- L: allowed and we know it's in the word? We are putting it at position 2? But we don't know if it's at position 2? We are testing.
- U: allowed? Yes, not in absent list.
- M: allowed? Yes.
- P: allowed? Yes.

So ""CLUMP"" is a valid word.

But we also have the possibility of L in other positions? We are testing L at position 2? If it's not there, we get feedback.

Alternatively, we could put L in position 3? For example: ""CULET""? But not common? Or ""CUBIC"" -> but has I? I is absent? I is in the absent list? Yes, so invalid.

Another: ""CABLE"" -> has A and E? Absent.

So let's list possible words that start with C, have an L, and avoid absent letters.

We can try L at position 5? For example: ""CUMUL"" -> not a word? Or ""CURDL"" -> has R? R is absent.

""CHILL"" -> but has H and I? I is absent? I is in the absent list? Yes, so invalid.

""CHALK"" -> has A? absent.

So it's a bit tricky.

Another idea: we can put L at position 3? For example: ""C_L _ _ _""

Words: ""CULT"" -> too short? ""CULTS"" -> has S? absent.

""COULD"" -> but O is absent? O is in the absent list? Yes, from guess2.

So we cannot use O.

""COLD"" -> too short? ""COLDS"" -> has O and S? both absent.

So we need to avoid O and S.

Let me think: ""C"" + [allowed letters] + L in one of 2,3,5.

Position 2: L -> then the word is ""CL???"".

We need two more letters? Actually, 3 more? Positions 3,4,5.

So ""CL"" followed by three letters from the allowed set: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we must form a valid word.

Examples:
- CLUMP: C,L,U,M,P -> valid? Yes, meaning a group of things.
- CLAMP: invalid because of A.
- CLINK: has I? I is absent? invalid.
- CLANK: has A and N? absent.
- CLUBS: has S? absent.
- CLUNG: has N? absent.
- CLASP: has A and S? absent.
- CLEPT: has E? absent.

So ""CLUMP"" seems good.

Another: ""CLIPT"" -> has I? absent.

""CLOMP"" -> has O? absent.

""CLUMP"" is one.

Another: ""CLAMP"" is invalid.

""CLUFF"" -> not a word? 

""CLUMP"" is acceptable.

But we can also try L at position 3? For example: ""C?L??""

We need to fill position 2,4,5 with allowed letters.

Position 2: cannot be O (absent) and must be from the allowed set.

For example: ""CULM"" -> not 5 letters? ""CULCH"" -> not common? 

""CYCL"" -> not a word.

""CAULK"" -> has A? absent.

""CHYLE"" -> has H,Y,L,E -> but E is absent? invalid.

""CHILD"" -> has I? absent.

""CHILI"" -> has I? absent.

So it's hard to find a word with L at position 3? 

Similarly, position 5: ""C????L""

For example: ""CABAL"" -> has A? absent.

""CAROL"" -> has A,O? absent.

""CRUEL"" -> has R,U,E? R and E absent? U is allowed? But R and E are absent -> invalid.

""CRWTH"" -> no L? 

""CUPPY"" -> no L? 

So ""CLUMP"" seems a good candidate.

But we also want to test other common letters? For example, we haven't tested T, U, M, P, etc.

In ""CLUMP"", we test:
- Position 1: C (known correct)
- Position 2: L -> we are testing if L is at position 2? If it is, we get ✓, if not, we get x? But we know L is in the word, so if it's not at position 2, we might get '-' if it's elsewhere? But we are also testing positions 3,4,5 with U,M,P.

If we get feedback that L is not at position 2, then we know it must be at position 3 or 5? Because position 4 is already excluded? And position 1 is C.

So we can gain information.

Also, we test U, M, P.

Therefore, I think ""CLUMP"" is a good guess.

But let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters? For example, T is common? 

""CLUMP"" doesn't have T? 

Another word: ""CLIPT"" -> invalid because of I.

""CLAPT"" -> has A? invalid.

""CLOUT"" -> has O? invalid.

""CLUMP"" seems the best so far.

We can try ""CLAMP"" but A is absent? No.

Another: ""CLEPT"" -> has E? invalid.

""CLINK"" -> has I? invalid.

So I think ""CLUMP"" is acceptable.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CLUMP"".

But note: we are not forced to put L in position 2? We could put it in position 3? But we don't have a good word? 

Alternatively, we can put L in position 5? For example: ""CRUMB"" -> has R? absent.

""CHUMP"" -> has H,U,M,P -> and L? no, we need to have L? We must include L because we know it's in the word? 

In the next guess, we must include L? Because we know it's in the word? Otherwise, we are not using the information? 

Yes, because we have to account for the L that is present? So we must include L in the guess? 

Therefore, the guess must contain the letter L? 

So ""CLUMP"" has L at position 2? 

Another word: ""CULCH"" -> not common? 

""CLUCK"" -> has U,C,K -> but C is at start? and L at position 2? and U at 3, C at 4? duplicate C? 

But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate C? 

In the first guess, we had only one C? and it was correct? but if there was another C, we would have seen a '-' for the duplicate? But we didn't have a duplicate in the guess? So we don't know? 

Therefore, we can try a word with duplicate? But in ""CLUCK"", we have two C's? 

But the secret word might have two C's? 

However, we are not sure? 

But let's avoid complexity? 

""CLUCK"" -> letters: C,L,U,C,K -> but the second C is at position 4? 

But we know the secret word has C at position 1? So if we put C at position 4? Then we might get feedback: 
- Position 1: C -> ✓ (correct)
- Position 4: C -> if the secret word has only one C, then we get x? because it's not present elsewhere? Or if it has two, we get '-'? 

But we don't know? 

Moreover, we are using a letter that we already know? We want to test new letters? 

So it's better to avoid using C again? Because we are wasting a slot? 

Therefore, we should avoid using C in positions 2-5? 

So in ""CLUMP"", we don't have duplicate C? Good. 

Similarly, we should avoid using any letter that we know is absent? 

So I think ""CLUMP"" is a good choice. 

Therefore, the next guess is ""CLUMP"". 

But let me confirm the word: C-L-U-M-P

Valid 5-letter word? Yes.

So <guess>clump</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - Position 1 is ""C"" (correct and in place).  
  - Letters ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are **absent** from the word.  

- **Guess 2: coils** → C(✓) O(x) I(x) L(-) S(x)  
  - Position 1 is ""C"" (confirmed again).  
  - Letters ""O"", ""I"", and ""S"" are **absent** from the word.  
  - Letter ""L"" is **present** but in the wrong position (not position 4).  

### Key Constraints:
- **Position 1** must be ""C"".  
- **Absent letters**: R, A, N, E, O, I, S (cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Present letter**: ""L"" must be included but **not in position 4**. Possible positions: 2, 3, or 5.  
- **Remaining allowed letters**: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since A, E, I, O, R, N, S are excluded).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Start with ""C"" (position 1 is fixed).  
- Include ""L"" in a new position (2, 3, or 5) to test its location.  
- Test new common consonants (e.g., M, P, U) to gather more information.  
- Avoid all absent letters and reuse of ""C"" in positions 2–5 to maximize new information.  

Selected word: **CLUMP**  
- C: Position 1 (correct, as required).  
- L: Position 2 (tests if ""L"" is here; if not, feedback will help locate it).  
- U, M, P: New letters tested in positions 3–5 (common consonants, not yet tried).  
- All letters are from the allowed set, and ""L"" is not in position 4.  

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities by testing ""L"" in position 2 and probing three new letters.

<guess>clump</guess>",clump,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- The first letter is 'C' and it is correct and in the correct position.
- The letters 'R', 'A', 'N', and 'E' are not in the secret word at all.

Guess 2: ""coils"" -> Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(x) L(-) S(x)
Meaning:
- The first letter 'C' is again correct (as we knew).
- The second letter 'O' is not in the word (x).
- The third letter 'I' is not in the word (x).
- The fourth letter 'L' is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- The fifth letter 'S' is not in the word (x).

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word starts with 'C'.
2. The secret word does not contain: R, A, N, E, O, I, S. (from the x's)
3. The secret word contains the letter 'L', but not in the fourth position.

Also, note that the letter 'L' is present but not in position 4. Since we have only one 'L' in the guess, we know there is at least one 'L' in the word, but it could be in position 1,2,3, or 5? But position 1 is already 'C', so it cannot be there. Therefore, the 'L' must be in position 2, 3, or 5? But wait, we have feedback that the second letter is not 'O' and it's absent, but that doesn't directly say about 'L' in position 2? Actually, we don't know about position 2 yet? The feedback for position 2 was for 'O' being absent, but that doesn't tell us about other letters.

However, we know that the secret word has an 'L' somewhere, but not in position 4. The possible positions for 'L' are 2, 3, or 5? But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence for that yet.

Now, let's list the constraints:

- Position 1: 'C'
- Positions 2,3,4,5: cannot be O, I, S (from the x's in guess2) and also cannot be R,A,N,E (from guess1). Also, the letter L is present but not in position 4.

So the absent letters are: R, A, N, E, O, I, S.

Therefore, the remaining letters that can be in the word are from the alphabet excluding: A, E, I, O, R, N, S.

The alphabet: A to Z, remove A, E, I, O, R, N, S -> remaining: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we already know the word has an 'L'. Also, the first letter is 'C', so we don't need to test that again? But we can use it? Actually, we must start with 'C'.

Now, the word must have an 'L' in one of the positions: 2, 3, or 5? (since position 4 is excluded by the feedback).

But note: position 5 was 'S' in guess2 and it was absent, so position 5 is not 'S', but it could be 'L'? Yes.

So possible positions for 'L': 2, 3, 5.

We also know that the secret word has exactly 5 letters, and we know one of them is 'L' (at least one) and the first is 'C'. The other three letters are from the remaining set.

We need to choose a new guess that:

- Starts with 'C'
- Does not use any of the absent letters: R,A,N,E,O,I,S
- Must include the letter 'L' (because we know it's in the word) and place it in a position that is not 4, and preferably in a position we haven't tested? We tested position 4 for L and it was wrong, so we can try position 2, 3, or 5.

But we also want to test other common letters to narrow down.

Common letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We already have L, so we need to test others.

We can try to put L in position 2? Because we haven't tested position 2 for L? We tested position 2 with O and it was absent, but that doesn't tell us about L.

Similarly, position 3 we tested with I and it was absent, and position 5 with S and absent.

So we can try L in position 2? Then we can test other letters in positions 3,4,5.

But note: we also need to consider that the word might have more than one of the remaining letters? We don't know.

Let's think of words that start with C, have an L in position 2, and use other allowed letters.

For example: ""CLUMP"" -> C, L, U, M, P -> all allowed? 
- U is allowed? Yes, not in the absent list.

But we don't know if U is in the word? We can test it.

Another: ""CLAMP"" -> but A is absent? A is in the absent list? Yes, so we cannot use A.

""CLAMP"" has A -> invalid.

""CLUMP"" is valid? Yes.

But we also have to avoid the absent letters.

Another: ""CLUB"" -> too short? Must be 5 letters: ""CLUBS"" -> but S is absent? S is in the absent list? Yes, so we cannot use S.

""CLUNG"" -> C,L,U,N,G -> but N is absent? N is in the absent list? Yes, from guess1.

So we cannot use N.

Therefore, ""CLUMP"" is: C,L,U,M,P -> all allowed? 
- C: allowed (but fixed at start)
- L: allowed and we know it's in the word? We are putting it at position 2? But we don't know if it's at position 2? We are testing.
- U: allowed? Yes, not in absent list.
- M: allowed? Yes.
- P: allowed? Yes.

So ""CLUMP"" is a valid word.

But we also have the possibility of L in other positions? We are testing L at position 2? If it's not there, we get feedback.

Alternatively, we could put L in position 3? For example: ""CULET""? But not common? Or ""CUBIC"" -> but has I? I is absent? I is in the absent list? Yes, so invalid.

Another: ""CABLE"" -> has A and E? Absent.

So let's list possible words that start with C, have an L, and avoid absent letters.

We can try L at position 5? For example: ""CUMUL"" -> not a word? Or ""CURDL"" -> has R? R is absent.

""CHILL"" -> but has H and I? I is absent? I is in the absent list? Yes, so invalid.

""CHALK"" -> has A? absent.

So it's a bit tricky.

Another idea: we can put L at position 3? For example: ""C_L _ _ _""

Words: ""CULT"" -> too short? ""CULTS"" -> has S? absent.

""COULD"" -> but O is absent? O is in the absent list? Yes, from guess2.

So we cannot use O.

""COLD"" -> too short? ""COLDS"" -> has O and S? both absent.

So we need to avoid O and S.

Let me think: ""C"" + [allowed letters] + L in one of 2,3,5.

Position 2: L -> then the word is ""CL???"".

We need two more letters? Actually, 3 more? Positions 3,4,5.

So ""CL"" followed by three letters from the allowed set: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we must form a valid word.

Examples:
- CLUMP: C,L,U,M,P -> valid? Yes, meaning a group of things.
- CLAMP: invalid because of A.
- CLINK: has I? I is absent? invalid.
- CLANK: has A and N? absent.
- CLUBS: has S? absent.
- CLUNG: has N? absent.
- CLASP: has A and S? absent.
- CLEPT: has E? absent.

So ""CLUMP"" seems good.

Another: ""CLIPT"" -> has I? absent.

""CLOMP"" -> has O? absent.

""CLUMP"" is one.

Another: ""CLAMP"" is invalid.

""CLUFF"" -> not a word? 

""CLUMP"" is acceptable.

But we can also try L at position 3? For example: ""C?L??""

We need to fill position 2,4,5 with allowed letters.

Position 2: cannot be O (absent) and must be from the allowed set.

For example: ""CULM"" -> not 5 letters? ""CULCH"" -> not common? 

""CYCL"" -> not a word.

""CAULK"" -> has A? absent.

""CHYLE"" -> has H,Y,L,E -> but E is absent? invalid.

""CHILD"" -> has I? absent.

""CHILI"" -> has I? absent.

So it's hard to find a word with L at position 3? 

Similarly, position 5: ""C????L""

For example: ""CABAL"" -> has A? absent.

""CAROL"" -> has A,O? absent.

""CRUEL"" -> has R,U,E? R and E absent? U is allowed? But R and E are absent -> invalid.

""CRWTH"" -> no L? 

""CUPPY"" -> no L? 

So ""CLUMP"" seems a good candidate.

But we also want to test other common letters? For example, we haven't tested T, U, M, P, etc.

In ""CLUMP"", we test:
- Position 1: C (known correct)
- Position 2: L -> we are testing if L is at position 2? If it is, we get ✓, if not, we get x? But we know L is in the word, so if it's not at position 2, we might get '-' if it's elsewhere? But we are also testing positions 3,4,5 with U,M,P.

If we get feedback that L is not at position 2, then we know it must be at position 3 or 5? Because position 4 is already excluded? And position 1 is C.

So we can gain information.

Also, we test U, M, P.

Therefore, I think ""CLUMP"" is a good guess.

But let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters? For example, T is common? 

""CLUMP"" doesn't have T? 

Another word: ""CLIPT"" -> invalid because of I.

""CLAPT"" -> has A? invalid.

""CLOUT"" -> has O? invalid.

""CLUMP"" seems the best so far.

We can try ""CLAMP"" but A is absent? No.

Another: ""CLEPT"" -> has E? invalid.

""CLINK"" -> has I? invalid.

So I think ""CLUMP"" is acceptable.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CLUMP"".

But note: we are not forced to put L in position 2? We could put it in position 3? But we don't have a good word? 

Alternatively, we can put L in position 5? For example: ""CRUMB"" -> has R? absent.

""CHUMP"" -> has H,U,M,P -> and L? no, we need to have L? We must include L because we know it's in the word? 

In the next guess, we must include L? Because we know it's in the word? Otherwise, we are not using the information? 

Yes, because we have to account for the L that is present? So we must include L in the guess? 

Therefore, the guess must contain the letter L? 

So ""CLUMP"" has L at position 2? 

Another word: ""CULCH"" -> not common? 

""CLUCK"" -> has U,C,K -> but C is at start? and L at position 2? and U at 3, C at 4? duplicate C? 

But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate C? 

In the first guess, we had only one C? and it was correct? but if there was another C, we would have seen a '-' for the duplicate? But we didn't have a duplicate in the guess? So we don't know? 

Therefore, we can try a word with duplicate? But in ""CLUCK"", we have two C's? 

But the secret word might have two C's? 

However, we are not sure? 

But let's avoid complexity? 

""CLUCK"" -> letters: C,L,U,C,K -> but the second C is at position 4? 

But we know the secret word has C at position 1? So if we put C at position 4? Then we might get feedback: 
- Position 1: C -> ✓ (correct)
- Position 4: C -> if the secret word has only one C, then we get x? because it's not present elsewhere? Or if it has two, we get '-'? 

But we don't know? 

Moreover, we are using a letter that we already know? We want to test new letters? 

So it's better to avoid using C again? Because we are wasting a slot? 

Therefore, we should avoid using C in positions 2-5? 

So in ""CLUMP"", we don't have duplicate C? Good. 

Similarly, we should avoid using any letter that we know is absent? 

So I think ""CLUMP"" is a good choice. 

Therefore, the next guess is ""CLUMP"". 

But let me confirm the word: C-L-U-M-P
