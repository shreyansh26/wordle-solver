We are starting the game. Since this is the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback. 
 We need to choose a 5-letter English word. It's good to pick a word that covers common letters to get maximum information.

 Common vowels and consonants are a good start. Words with a lot of vowels might not cover as many consonants. 
 Alternatively, words with common consonants and vowels can be helpful.

 Some common starting words in Wordle are:
 - CRANE, SLATE, CRATE, STARE, ADIEU, etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 1 vowel (A, E). 
 But note: the feedback format uses ✓, -, and x. We want to maximize the information we get.

 However, note the example: ""STORM"" for secret word ""BRISK"" gave feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x).

 The word ""CRANE"":
  - C: common consonant
  - R: common consonant
  - A: common vowel
  - N: common consonant
  - E: common vowel

 This word covers 4 distinct consonants and 2 vowels (with E at the end). It's a balanced word.

 Another common strategy is to pick words without repeated letters. ""CRANE"" has no repeated letters.

 So let's go with ""CRANE"".
</think>
After analyzing the game rules and considering common strategies for initial guesses in word games, I chose a word that includes frequent vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. ""CRANE"" is effective because it contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), helping identify letter presence/absence quickly.

We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, and it is not in the third position. Also, we must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.

We need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E.
- Includes the letter A, but not in the third position.

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have the letter A and avoid the forbidden letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

One common strategy is to try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common consonants.

Possible positions for A: since it can't be in position 3, we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's list some candidate words:

- A in position 1: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""APART"", ""APPLE"", etc.
  But note: we cannot use E (from ABOUT, ABOVE, AFTER, APART) because E is eliminated. Also, we cannot use R (in ABOUT, AFTER, APART) because R is eliminated.

  So, we need words without E and R.

  For example: 
    ""ALONG"": A, L, O, N, G -> but N is eliminated, so not allowed.
    ""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E -> E is eliminated and also repeated P? But the word is valid, but we cannot use E. So not allowed.

  Let's try ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> all new letters? But we don't know if they are in the word. This word has A in position 1 and avoids the forbidden letters.

- A in position 2: words like ""PASTA"", but S and T are new, but we have A in position 2 and then T in position 3? But we cannot use E, R, etc. Also, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5? But we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don't say the secret word has distinct letters, so duplicates are possible. However, in our feedback for ""crane"", we only have one A and it was marked as present, so if there were two A's, we might have gotten two marks? But the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we have only one A in ""crane"", we only know that at least one A is present. The secret word might have more than one A.

  But for now, let's avoid duplicates to maximize information.

  ""SAULT"": but U, L, T? But we don't have E, R? Actually, ""SAULT"" is not a common word. How about ""SALAD""? But that has two A's and we don't know if that's good. Also, we want to avoid known absent letters.

  Let's think of ""PAINT"": but N is eliminated, so not allowed.

  ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. This avoids forbidden letters.

- A in position 4: words like ""PLANT"" -> but N is eliminated, so not allowed. ""TRACK"" -> R and C are eliminated. ""BLAZE"" -> E is eliminated.

  ""FOCAL"": F, O, C, A, L -> but C is eliminated, so not allowed.

  ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E is eliminated.

  It's getting tricky.

- A in position 5: words like ""PIZZA"", but Z is not common. ""AROMA"" -> but A is repeated and we have R which is eliminated. ""OUTLA"" not a word.

  ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated and A repeated.

Given the constraints, let's try to form a word without the forbidden letters and with A in a position other than 3.

We can try A in position 1: 
  Without E, R, C, N: 
    Words: AUDIO, AUDIT, AVOID, ATOLL, ATOMS, etc.

AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O -> all new letters and no duplicates. This is a good candidate because it covers 5 new vowels and consonants.

We can try A in position 2:
  Words: SALAD (but duplicate A and we don't know if duplicate is good, and D is new), 
          PAGAN (but G and N, N is eliminated), 
          MAJOR (but R is eliminated), 
          TABBY (duplicate B? and Y is new), 
          HABIT (H, A, B, I, T) -> no forbidden letters.

HABIT: H, A, B, I, T -> A in position 2, and we get to test H, B, I, T.

Similarly, we can consider A in position 4: 
  Words: OPTAL (not common), 
          FOCAL (has C, eliminated), 
          LEGAL (has E, eliminated), 
          ROTAL (has R, eliminated), 
          VITAL (V, I, T, A, L) -> no forbidden letters? V, I, T, A, L. So A in position 4.

VITAL: V, I, T, A, L -> covers V, I, T, L and A in position 4.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has A in position 1,2,4, or 5. We want to test A in a position that we haven't tried and that is likely.

Since we have no information about other positions, we can choose a word that tests A in a new position and also tests many common letters.

Considering the above, two strong candidates are:
1. AUDIO: tests A in position 1 and U, D, I, O.
2. HABIT: tests A in position 2 and H, B, I, T.

We can also consider:
3. VITAL: tests A in position 4 and V, I, T, L.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more common letters.

Another candidate: ""PASTA"" -> but P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A and we don't know if that's efficient. Also, A is in position 2 and 5. But we know A is present at least once, so if we get two A's in the feedback, we know there are two. But it might be better to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Therefore, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it uses 5 new letters and places A in a new position (position 1). Also, it covers multiple vowels (A, I, O, U) and one consonant (D), which might help us narrow down the vowels in the word.

Alternatively, ""HABIT"" tests more consonants (H, B, T) and one vowel (I) and A.

But since we know A is in the word, and we don't know about vowels, testing multiple vowels might be good.

However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" showed that E is absent, so the secret word might have other vowels: A (we know), and possibly I, O, U.

So ""AUDIO"" tests A, U, D, I, O.

But D is a consonant. This word has 4 vowels and one consonant.

Another option: ""ADIEU"" is a common starter, but it has E and we know E is absent, so we cannot use it.

So, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice.

But let me check if ""AUDIO"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

So, I will go with ""AUDIO"".

But note: we must avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""AUDIO"" does not contain any of these.

Therefore, our next guess: AUDIO.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (misplaced).
- **C, R, N, E** are absent (not in the word).

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed present) but **not in position 3**.
- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters and positions to maximize information.

The word **AUDIO** is chosen because:
- It includes **A** in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It introduces 4 new common letters (**U, D, I, O**), covering vowels and consonants.
- It avoids forbidden letters and repeats, helping identify additional correct/absent letters efficiently.

<guess>audio</guess>",audio,"We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, and it is not in the third position. Also, we must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.

We need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:

    ""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E -> E is eliminated and also repeated P? But the word is valid, but we cannot use E. So not allowed.

  Let's try ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> all new letters? But we don't know if they are in the word. This word has A in position 1 and avoids the forbidden letters.

- A in position 2: words like ""PASTA"", but S and T are new, but we have A in position 2 and then T in position 3? But we cannot use E, R, etc. Also, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5?

Since we have only one A in ""crane"", we only know that at least one A is present. The secret word might have more than one A.

  But for now, let's avoid duplicates to maximize information.

  ""SAULT"": but U, L, T? But we don't have E, R? Actually, ""SAULT"" is not a common word. How about ""SALAD""? But that has two A's and we don't know if that's good. Also, we want to avoid known absent letters.

- A in position 4: words like ""PLANT"" -> but N is eliminated, so not allowed. ""TRACK"" -> R and C are eliminated. ""BLAZE"" -> E is eliminated.

  ""FOCAL"": F, O, C, A, L -> but C is eliminated, so not allowed.

  ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E is eliminated.

  It's getting tricky.

- A in position 5: words like ""PIZZA"", but Z is not common. ""AROMA"" -> but A is repeated and we have R which is eliminated. ""OUTLA"" not a word.

  ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated and A repeated.

Given the constraints, let's try to form a word without the forbidden letters and with A in a position other than 3.

We can try A in position 1:

          TABBY (duplicate B? and Y is new), 
          HABIT (H, A, B, I, T) -> no forbidden letters.

HABIT: H, A, B, I, T -> A in position 2, and we get to test H, B, I, T.

Similarly, we can consider A in position 4: 
  Words: OPTAL (not common), 
          FOCAL (has C, eliminated),

          VITAL (V, I, T, A, L) -> no forbidden letters? V, I, T, A, L. So A in position 4.

VITAL: V, I, T, A, L -> covers V, I, T, L and A in position 4.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has A in position 1,2,4, or 5. We want to test A in a position that we haven't tried and that is likely.

Since we have no information about other positions, we can choose a word that tests A in a new position and also tests many common letters.

Considering the above, two strong candidates are:
1. AUDIO: tests A in position 1 and U, D, I, O.
2. HABIT: tests A in position 2 and H, B, I, T.

We can also consider:
3. VITAL: tests A in position 4 and V, I, T, L.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more common letters.

Another candidate: ""PASTA"" -> but P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A and we don't know if that's efficient. Also, A is in position 2 and 5.

Alternatively, ""HABIT"" tests more consonants (H, B, T) and one vowel (I) and A.

However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" showed that E is absent, so the secret word might have other vowels: A (we know), and possibly I, O, U.

So ""AUDIO"" tests A, U, D, I, O.

But D is a consonant. This word has 4 vowels and one consonant.

So, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice.

But let me check if ""AUDIO"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since this is the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback. 
 We need to choose a 5-letter English word. It's good to pick a word that covers common letters to get maximum information.

 Common vowels and consonants are a good start. Words with a lot of vowels might not cover as many consonants. 
 Alternatively, words with common consonants and vowels can be helpful.

 Some common starting words in Wordle are:
 - CRANE, SLATE, CRATE, STARE, ADIEU, etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 1 vowel (A, E). 
 But note: the feedback format uses ✓, -, and x. We want to maximize the information we get.

 However, note the example: ""STORM"" for secret word ""BRISK"" gave feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x).

 The word ""CRANE"":
  - C: common consonant
  - R: common consonant
  - A: common vowel
  - N: common consonant
  - E: common vowel

 This word covers 4 distinct consonants and 2 vowels (with E at the end). It's a balanced word.

 Another common strategy is to pick words without repeated letters. ""CRANE"" has no repeated letters.

 So let's go with ""CRANE"".After analyzing the game rules and considering common strategies for initial guesses in word games, I chose a word that includes frequent vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. ""CRANE"" is effective because it contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), helping identify letter presence/absence quickly.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, and it is not in the third position. Also, we must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.

We need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E.
- Includes the letter A, but not in the third position.

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have the letter A and avoid the forbidden letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

One common strategy is to try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common consonants.

Possible positions for A: since it can't be in position 3, we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's list some candidate words:

- A in position 1: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""APART"", ""APPLE"", etc.
  But note: we cannot use E (from ABOUT, ABOVE, AFTER, APART) because E is eliminated. Also, we cannot use R (in ABOUT, AFTER, APART) because R is eliminated.

  So, we need words without E and R.

  For example: 
    ""ALONG"": A, L, O, N, G -> but N is eliminated, so not allowed.
    ""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E -> E is eliminated and also repeated P? But the word is valid, but we cannot use E. So not allowed.

  Let's try ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> all new letters? But we don't know if they are in the word. This word has A in position 1 and avoids the forbidden letters.

- A in position 2: words like ""PASTA"", but S and T are new, but we have A in position 2 and then T in position 3? But we cannot use E, R, etc. Also, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5? But we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don't say the secret word has distinct letters, so duplicates are possible. However, in our feedback for ""crane"", we only have one A and it was marked as present, so if there were two A's, we might have gotten two marks? But the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we have only one A in ""crane"", we only know that at least one A is present. The secret word might have more than one A.

  But for now, let's avoid duplicates to maximize information.

  ""SAULT"": but U, L, T? But we don't have E, R? Actually, ""SAULT"" is not a common word. How about ""SALAD""? But that has two A's and we don't know if that's good. Also, we want to avoid known absent letters.

  Let's think of ""PAINT"": but N is eliminated, so not allowed.

  ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. This avoids forbidden letters.

- A in position 4: words like ""PLANT"" -> but N is eliminated, so not allowed. ""TRACK"" -> R and C are eliminated. ""BLAZE"" -> E is eliminated.

  ""FOCAL"": F, O, C, A, L -> but C is eliminated, so not allowed.

  ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E is eliminated.

  It's getting tricky.

- A in position 5: words like ""PIZZA"", but Z is not common. ""AROMA"" -> but A is repeated and we have R which is eliminated. ""OUTLA"" not a word.

  ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated and A repeated.

Given the constraints, let's try to form a word without the forbidden letters and with A in a position other than 3.

We can try A in position 1: 
  Without E, R, C, N: 
    Words: AUDIO, AUDIT, AVOID, ATOLL, ATOMS, etc.

AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O -> all new letters and no duplicates. This is a good candidate because it covers 5 new vowels and consonants.

We can try A in position 2:
  Words: SALAD (but duplicate A and we don't know if duplicate is good, and D is new), 
          PAGAN (but G and N, N is eliminated), 
          MAJOR (but R is eliminated), 
          TABBY (duplicate B? and Y is new), 
          HABIT (H, A, B, I, T) -> no forbidden letters.

HABIT: H, A, B, I, T -> A in position 2, and we get to test H, B, I, T.

Similarly, we can consider A in position 4: 
  Words: OPTAL (not common), 
          FOCAL (has C, eliminated), 
          LEGAL (has E, eliminated), 
          ROTAL (has R, eliminated), 
          VITAL (V, I, T, A, L) -> no forbidden letters? V, I, T, A, L. So A in position 4.

VITAL: V, I, T, A, L -> covers V, I, T, L and A in position 4.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has A in position 1,2,4, or 5. We want to test A in a position that we haven't tried and that is likely.

Since we have no information about other positions, we can choose a word that tests A in a new position and also tests many common letters.

Considering the above, two strong candidates are:
1. AUDIO: tests A in position 1 and U, D, I, O.
2. HABIT: tests A in position 2 and H, B, I, T.

We can also consider:
3. VITAL: tests A in position 4 and V, I, T, L.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more common letters.

Another candidate: ""PASTA"" -> but P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A and we don't know if that's efficient. Also, A is in position 2 and 5. But we know A is present at least once, so if we get two A's in the feedback, we know there are two. But it might be better to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Therefore, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it uses 5 new letters and places A in a new position (position 1). Also, it covers multiple vowels (A, I, O, U) and one consonant (D), which might help us narrow down the vowels in the word.

Alternatively, ""HABIT"" tests more consonants (H, B, T) and one vowel (I) and A.

But since we know A is in the word, and we don't know about vowels, testing multiple vowels might be good.

However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" showed that E is absent, so the secret word might have other vowels: A (we know), and possibly I, O, U.

So ""AUDIO"" tests A, U, D, I, O.

But D is a consonant. This word has 4 vowels and one consonant.

Another option: ""ADIEU"" is a common starter, but it has E and we know E is absent, so we cannot use it.

So, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice.

But let me check if ""AUDIO"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

So, I will go with ""AUDIO"".

But note: we must avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""AUDIO"" does not contain any of these.

Therefore, our next guess: AUDIO.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (misplaced).
- **C, R, N, E** are absent (not in the word).

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed present) but **not in position 3**.
- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters and positions to maximize information.

The word **AUDIO** is chosen because:
- It includes **A** in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It introduces 4 new common letters (**U, D, I, O**), covering vowels and consonants.
- It avoids forbidden letters and repeats, helping identify additional correct/absent letters efficiently.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - This means:
        C: absent (not in the word)
        R: absent
        A: present but not in the 3rd position (since in ""crane"" it was in position 3)
        N: absent
        E: absent

2. ""audio"" -> A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
   - This means:

        U: absent
        D: absent
        I: absent
        O: absent

From both feedbacks, we can deduce:

- The letter A is in the word, but not in position 1 (from ""audio"") and not in position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

- The following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We now know the secret word contains A (at least one occurrence) and does not contain any of: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We have to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Includes the letter A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 1 or 3).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We also want to test as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tested yet:
Vowels: We have tested A, E, I, O, U. The only vowel left is possibly Y? But note: A is already in the word, and we know E, I, O, U are absent. So the only vowel we have is A and possibly Y.

Consonants: We have tested C, R, N, D. So we have many left: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: Y can be a vowel or consonant, but in this case, since we are missing vowels, we should consider Y as a vowel possibility.

So the word must have A and possibly Y as the only vowel? Because E, I, O, U are out.

Therefore, the secret word likely has A and maybe Y, and the rest are consonants from the available set.

We should try to cover as many common consonants as possible and also test the position of A.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.

Let's think of words that have A in one of these positions and use only the available letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

We can try:

- A in position 2: 
  - Words: _ A _ _ _
  - Examples: ""BASTY"" (but is that a word? not really), ""PASTY"" (a word, meaning like a pastry), ""HASTY"", ""NASTY"" (but N is out), ""MASTY"" (not common). 
  - Since N is out, we can try ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> but we haven't tested H, S, T, Y. And A in position 2.

- A in position 4:
  - Words: _ _ _ A _
  - Examples: ""PLANT"" (N out), ""SLANT"" (N out), ""BLAST"" (but we have A in position 4? B, L, A, S, T -> A is in position 3? Wait, let's index: position 1: B, 2: L, 3: A, 4: S, 5: T -> but we know A cannot be in position 3. So we need A in position 4. 
  - How about ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P -> A is in position 3? No, that's position 3 again. We need position 4: so the fourth letter is A. 
  - Example: ""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but I is out. 
  - ""FOCAL"" -> O and C out. 
  - ""LYCRA"" -> L, Y, C, R, A -> C and R out. 
  - It's tricky. How about ""BYLAW"": B, Y, L, A, W -> A in position 4. This uses B, Y, L, W. And avoids forbidden letters.

- A in position 5:
  - Words: _ _ _ _ A
  - Examples: ""PIZZA"" (Z is not common, and we have I out), ""TABLA"" (T, A, B, L, A -> duplicate A? and A in position 2 and 5, but we don't know if duplicate is allowed). 
  - ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N out. 
  - ""ALGAE"" -> E out and A in position 1 which we know is not allowed? Actually, in ""ALGAE"", A is in position 1 and 5? But we know A cannot be in position 1. 
  - We need a word with A only at the end. 
  - Example: ""ULTRA"" -> U and R out. 
  - ""EXTRA"" -> E and R out. 
  - ""OCTAL"" -> O and C out. 
  - ""FATWA"": F, A, T, W, A -> A in position 2 and 5? But we can have A at the end. However, we are testing A in position 5. But note: we also have A in position 2, which we know is a possible position? But we don't know if the word has two A's. 
  - Alternatively, ""SALSA"": S, A, L, S, A -> A in position 2 and 5, and duplicate S. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. 

Given the constraints, let's list some candidate words that are valid and avoid the forbidden letters and have A in position 2, 4, or 5.

Candidate 1: ""HASTY"" 
  - H, A, S, T, Y
  - A in position 2
  - Tests H, S, T, Y (all new) and A (which we know is present, but we are testing position 2)

Candidate 2: ""PASTY""
  - P, A, S, T, Y
  - A in position 2
  - Tests P, S, T, Y

Candidate 3: ""BYLAW""
  - B, Y, L, A, W
  - A in position 4
  - Tests B, Y, L, W

Candidate 4: ""GAMMA"" 
  - G, A, M, M, A -> but duplicate M and duplicate A? And A is in position 2 and 5. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are testing A in position 2 and 5? But we know A is present, so if we get two A's in feedback, we know there are two. However, it uses duplicate M which might not be efficient for information.

But note: we only have 4 guesses left (since we used 2, and we have 6 total). We want to maximize information.

Another candidate: ""SASSY"" -> but duplicate S and Y, and A is not present? We must include A.

We must include A.

Another idea: ""TAFFY"" -> T, A, F, F, Y -> A in position 2, and duplicate F. But we test T, F, Y.

But duplicate letters might not be ideal because we get less information.

So, let's avoid duplicates if possible.

Therefore, ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY"" are good because they have no duplicates and test 4 new letters.

We can also consider ""SHALT"" -> S, H, A, L, T -> A in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So invalid.

""PLATY"" -> P, L, A, T, Y -> A in position 3? Again, position 3 is invalid.

So for position 2: ""HASTY"", ""PASTY"", ""BAWDY"" (B, A, W, D, Y -> but D is out? D is absent, so we cannot use D). D is absent from the feedback of ""audio"".

In ""audio"", D was marked absent, so we cannot use D.

Similarly, in ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> all are new and not forbidden? 
Forbidden: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. So H, S, T, Y are allowed.

Similarly, ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> same.

But note: we don't know if Y is allowed. We haven't tested it, so it's okay.

Another candidate: ""MAWKY"" (meaning sullen) -> M, A, W, K, Y -> A in position 2. Tests M, W, K, Y.

But ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY"" are more common.

We can also consider A in position 5: 
  ""PHYLA"" -> P, H, Y, L, A -> A in position 5. Tests P, H, Y, L.

But ""PHYLA"" is a word (plural of phylum).

However, we don't know if the word has Y. We need to test it.

But note: we have very few vowels left. Since E, I, O, U are absent, the only vowels can be A and Y (if Y is used as a vowel). So it's important to test Y.

In fact, the secret word might have Y.

So both ""HASTY"" and ""PHYLA"" are good.

But ""HASTY"" has A in position 2, which is one of the possible positions, and tests S and T which are very common.

Similarly, ""PHYLA"" tests P, H, Y, L and A in position 5.

We have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common consonants. S and T are very common.

So ""HASTY"" or ""PASTY"" are good.

But note: we also want to test the position of A. If we put A in position 2, and if it turns out to be correct, we know A is in position 2. If not, then A must be in 4 or 5.

Similarly, if we put A in position 5 and it's correct, we know. But if we put it in position 2 and it's wrong, we still have positions 4 and 5.

But we have to cover as many letters as possible.

I think ""HASTY"" is a good choice because:
- It tests A in position 2 (if it's correct, we get a check, if not, we know it's misplaced and then we know it must be in 4 or 5).
- It tests H, S, T, Y, which are common.

So let's go with ""HASTY"".

But wait, is ""HASTY"" a valid word? Yes.

Therefore, our next guess: HASTY.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **A** is confirmed present but not in positions 1 or 3 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).
- **C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O** are confirmed absent and cannot be used.
- The secret word likely contains **A** and possibly **Y** (as the only untested vowel), with consonants from the remaining pool (B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** in position 2, 4, or 5 to test its location.
- Prioritize testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, H) and the vowel Y.
- Avoid duplicate letters to maximize information gain.

**Why ""HASTY""?**
- Places **A in position 2** (testing one of the valid positions).
- Introduces **H, S, T, Y** (all untested letters; S and T are high-frequency consonants, Y is a key vowel candidate).
- Avoids forbidden letters and repeats, ensuring efficient feedback.
- If **A** is correct in position 2, we get immediate confirmation. If not, we narrow its position to 4 or 5 while checking four new letters.

<guess>hasty</guess>",hasty,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - This means:
        C: absent (not in the word)
        R: absent
        A: present but not in the 3rd position (since in ""crane"" it was in position 3)
        N: absent
        E: absent

2. ""audio"" -> A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
   - This means:
        A: present but not in the 1st position (since in ""audio"" it was in position 1)
        U: absent
        D: absent
        I: absent
        O: absent

From both feedbacks, we can deduce:

- The letter A is in the word, but not in position 1 (from ""audio"") and not in position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

- The following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We now know the secret word contains A (at least one occurrence) and does not contain any of: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We have to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Includes the letter A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 1 or 3).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We also want to test as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tested yet:
Vowels: We have tested A, E, I, O, U. The only vowel left is possibly Y? But note: A is already in the word, and we know E, I, O, U are absent. So the only vowel we have is A and possibly Y.

Consonants: We have tested C, R, N, D. So we have many left: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: Y can be a vowel or consonant, but in this case, since we are missing vowels, we should consider Y as a vowel possibility.

So the word must have A and possibly Y as the only vowel? Because E, I, O, U are out.

Therefore, the secret word likely has A and maybe Y, and the rest are consonants from the available set.

We should try to cover as many common consonants as possible and also test the position of A.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.

Let's think of words that have A in one of these positions and use only the available letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

We can try:

- A in position 2: 
  - Words: _ A _ _ _
  - Examples: ""BASTY"" (but is that a word? not really), ""PASTY"" (a word, meaning like a pastry), ""HASTY"", ""NASTY"" (but N is out), ""MASTY"" (not common). 
  - Since N is out, we can try ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> but we haven't tested H, S, T, Y. And A in position 2.

- A in position 4:
  - Words: _ _ _ A _
  - Examples: ""PLANT"" (N out), ""SLANT"" (N out), ""BLAST"" (but we have A in position 4? B, L, A, S, T -> A is in position 3? Wait, let's index: position 1: B, 2: L, 3: A, 4: S, 5: T -> but we know A cannot be in position 3. So we need A in position 4. 
  - How about ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P -> A is in position 3? No, that's position 3 again. We need position 4: so the fourth letter is A. 
  - Example: ""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but I is out. 
  - ""FOCAL"" -> O and C out. 
  - ""LYCRA"" -> L, Y, C, R, A -> C and R out. 
  - It's tricky. How about ""BYLAW"": B, Y, L, A, W -> A in position 4. This uses B, Y, L, W. And avoids forbidden letters.

- A in position 5:
  - Words: _ _ _ _ A
  - Examples: ""PIZZA"" (Z is not common, and we have I out), ""TABLA"" (T, A, B, L, A -> duplicate A? and A in position 2 and 5, but we don't know if duplicate is allowed). 
  - ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N out. 
  - ""ALGAE"" -> E out and A in position 1 which we know is not allowed? Actually, in ""ALGAE"", A is in position 1 and 5? But we know A cannot be in position 1. 
  - We need a word with A only at the end. 
  - Example: ""ULTRA"" -> U and R out. 
  - ""EXTRA"" -> E and R out. 
  - ""OCTAL"" -> O and C out. 
  - ""FATWA"": F, A, T, W, A -> A in position 2 and 5? But we can have A at the end. However, we are testing A in position 5. But note: we also have A in position 2, which we know is a possible position? But we don't know if the word has two A's. 
  - Alternatively, ""SALSA"": S, A, L, S, A -> A in position 2 and 5, and duplicate S. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. 

Given the constraints, let's list some candidate words that are valid and avoid the forbidden letters and have A in position 2, 4, or 5.

Candidate 1: ""HASTY"" 
  - H, A, S, T, Y
  - A in position 2
  - Tests H, S, T, Y (all new) and A (which we know is present, but we are testing position 2)

Candidate 2: ""PASTY""
  - P, A, S, T, Y
  - A in position 2
  - Tests P, S, T, Y

Candidate 3: ""BYLAW""
  - B, Y, L, A, W
  - A in position 4
  - Tests B, Y, L, W

Candidate 4: ""GAMMA"" 
  - G, A, M, M, A -> but duplicate M and duplicate A? And A is in position 2 and 5. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are testing A in position 2 and 5? But we know A is present, so if we get two A's in feedback, we know there are two. However, it uses duplicate M which might not be efficient for information.

But note: we only have 4 guesses left (since we used 2, and we have 6 total). We want to maximize information.

Another candidate: ""SASSY"" -> but duplicate S and Y, and A is not present? We must include A.

We must include A.

Another idea: ""TAFFY"" -> T, A, F, F, Y -> A in position 2, and duplicate F. But we test T, F, Y.

But duplicate letters might not be ideal because we get less information.

So, let's avoid duplicates if possible.

Therefore, ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY"" are good because they have no duplicates and test 4 new letters.

We can also consider ""SHALT"" -> S, H, A, L, T -> A in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So invalid.

""PLATY"" -> P, L, A, T, Y -> A in position 3? Again, position 3 is invalid.

So for position 2: ""HASTY"", ""PASTY"", ""BAWDY"" (B, A, W, D, Y -> but D is out? D is absent, so we cannot use D). D is absent from the feedback of ""audio"".

In ""audio"", D was marked absent, so we cannot use D.

Similarly, in ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> all are new and not forbidden? 
Forbidden: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. So H, S, T, Y are allowed.

Similarly, ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> same.

But note: we don't know if Y is allowed. We haven't tested it, so it's okay.

Another candidate: ""MAWKY"" (meaning sullen) -> M, A, W, K, Y -> A in position 2. Tests M, W, K, Y.

But ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY"" are more common.

We can also consider A in position 5: 
  ""PHYLA"" -> P, H, Y, L, A -> A in position 5. Tests P, H, Y, L.

But ""PHYLA"" is a word (plural of phylum).

However, we don't know if the word has Y. We need to test it.

But note: we have very few vowels left. Since E, I, O, U are absent, the only vowels can be A and Y (if Y is used as a vowel). So it's important to test Y.

In fact, the secret word might have Y.

So both ""HASTY"" and ""PHYLA"" are good.

But ""HASTY"" has A in position 2, which is one of the possible positions, and tests S and T which are very common.

Similarly, ""PHYLA"" tests P, H, Y, L and A in position 5.

We have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common consonants. S and T are very common.

So ""HASTY"" or ""PASTY"" are good.

But note: we also want to test the position of A. If we put A in position 2, and if it turns out to be correct, we know A is in position 2. If not, then A must be in 4 or 5.

Similarly, if we put A in position 5 and it's correct, we know. But if we put it in position 2 and it's wrong, we still have positions 4 and 5.

But we have to cover as many letters as possible.

I think ""HASTY"" is a good choice because:
- It tests A in position 2 (if it's correct, we get a check, if not, we know it's misplaced and then we know it must be in 4 or 5).
- It tests H, S, T, Y, which are common.

So let's go with ""HASTY"".

But wait, is ""HASTY"" a valid word? Yes.

Therefore, our next guess: HASTY.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **A** is confirmed present but not in positions 1 or 3 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).
- **C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O** are confirmed absent and cannot be used.
- The secret word likely contains **A** and possibly **Y** (as the only untested vowel), with consonants from the remaining pool (B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** in position 2, 4, or 5 to test its location.
- Prioritize testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, H) and the vowel Y.
- Avoid duplicate letters to maximize information gain.

**Why ""HASTY""?**
- Places **A in position 2** (testing one of the valid positions).
- Introduces **H, S, T, Y** (all untested letters; S and T are high-frequency consonants, Y is a key vowel candidate).
- Avoids forbidden letters and repeats, ensuring efficient feedback.
- If **A** is correct in position 2, we get immediate confirmation. If not, we narrow its position to 4 or 5 while checking four new letters.",Guess 3: hasty -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) S(x) T(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since this is the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback. 
 We need to choose a 5-letter English word. It's good to pick a word that covers common letters to get maximum information.

 Common vowels and consonants are a good start. Words with a lot of vowels might not cover as many consonants. 
 Alternatively, words with common consonants and vowels can be helpful.

 Some common starting words in Wordle are:
 - CRANE, SLATE, CRATE, STARE, ADIEU, etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 1 vowel (A, E). 
 But note: the feedback format uses ✓, -, and x. We want to maximize the information we get.

 However, note the example: ""STORM"" for secret word ""BRISK"" gave feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x).

 The word ""CRANE"":
  - C: common consonant
  - R: common consonant
  - A: common vowel
  - N: common consonant
  - E: common vowel

 This word covers 4 distinct consonants and 2 vowels (with E at the end). It's a balanced word.

 Another common strategy is to pick words without repeated letters. ""CRANE"" has no repeated letters.

 So let's go with ""CRANE"".After analyzing the game rules and considering common strategies for initial guesses in word games, I chose a word that includes frequent vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. ""CRANE"" is effective because it contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), helping identify letter presence/absence quickly.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, and it is not in the third position. Also, we must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.

We need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E.
- Includes the letter A, but not in the third position.

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have the letter A and avoid the forbidden letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

One common strategy is to try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common consonants.

Possible positions for A: since it can't be in position 3, we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's list some candidate words:

- A in position 1: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""APART"", ""APPLE"", etc.
  But note: we cannot use E (from ABOUT, ABOVE, AFTER, APART) because E is eliminated. Also, we cannot use R (in ABOUT, AFTER, APART) because R is eliminated.

  So, we need words without E and R.

  For example: 
    ""ALONG"": A, L, O, N, G -> but N is eliminated, so not allowed.
    ""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E -> E is eliminated and also repeated P? But the word is valid, but we cannot use E. So not allowed.

  Let's try ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> all new letters? But we don't know if they are in the word. This word has A in position 1 and avoids the forbidden letters.

- A in position 2: words like ""PASTA"", but S and T are new, but we have A in position 2 and then T in position 3? But we cannot use E, R, etc. Also, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5? But we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don't say the secret word has distinct letters, so duplicates are possible. However, in our feedback for ""crane"", we only have one A and it was marked as present, so if there were two A's, we might have gotten two marks? But the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we have only one A in ""crane"", we only know that at least one A is present. The secret word might have more than one A.

  But for now, let's avoid duplicates to maximize information.

  ""SAULT"": but U, L, T? But we don't have E, R? Actually, ""SAULT"" is not a common word. How about ""SALAD""? But that has two A's and we don't know if that's good. Also, we want to avoid known absent letters.

  Let's think of ""PAINT"": but N is eliminated, so not allowed.

  ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. This avoids forbidden letters.

- A in position 4: words like ""PLANT"" -> but N is eliminated, so not allowed. ""TRACK"" -> R and C are eliminated. ""BLAZE"" -> E is eliminated.

  ""FOCAL"": F, O, C, A, L -> but C is eliminated, so not allowed.

  ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E is eliminated.

  It's getting tricky.

- A in position 5: words like ""PIZZA"", but Z is not common. ""AROMA"" -> but A is repeated and we have R which is eliminated. ""OUTLA"" not a word.

  ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated and A repeated.

Given the constraints, let's try to form a word without the forbidden letters and with A in a position other than 3.

We can try A in position 1: 
  Without E, R, C, N: 
    Words: AUDIO, AUDIT, AVOID, ATOLL, ATOMS, etc.

AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O -> all new letters and no duplicates. This is a good candidate because it covers 5 new vowels and consonants.

We can try A in position 2:
  Words: SALAD (but duplicate A and we don't know if duplicate is good, and D is new), 
          PAGAN (but G and N, N is eliminated), 
          MAJOR (but R is eliminated), 
          TABBY (duplicate B? and Y is new), 
          HABIT (H, A, B, I, T) -> no forbidden letters.

HABIT: H, A, B, I, T -> A in position 2, and we get to test H, B, I, T.

Similarly, we can consider A in position 4: 
  Words: OPTAL (not common), 
          FOCAL (has C, eliminated), 
          LEGAL (has E, eliminated), 
          ROTAL (has R, eliminated), 
          VITAL (V, I, T, A, L) -> no forbidden letters? V, I, T, A, L. So A in position 4.

VITAL: V, I, T, A, L -> covers V, I, T, L and A in position 4.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has A in position 1,2,4, or 5. We want to test A in a position that we haven't tried and that is likely.

Since we have no information about other positions, we can choose a word that tests A in a new position and also tests many common letters.

Considering the above, two strong candidates are:
1. AUDIO: tests A in position 1 and U, D, I, O.
2. HABIT: tests A in position 2 and H, B, I, T.

We can also consider:
3. VITAL: tests A in position 4 and V, I, T, L.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more common letters.

Another candidate: ""PASTA"" -> but P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A and we don't know if that's efficient. Also, A is in position 2 and 5. But we know A is present at least once, so if we get two A's in the feedback, we know there are two. But it might be better to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Therefore, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it uses 5 new letters and places A in a new position (position 1). Also, it covers multiple vowels (A, I, O, U) and one consonant (D), which might help us narrow down the vowels in the word.

Alternatively, ""HABIT"" tests more consonants (H, B, T) and one vowel (I) and A.

But since we know A is in the word, and we don't know about vowels, testing multiple vowels might be good.

However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" showed that E is absent, so the secret word might have other vowels: A (we know), and possibly I, O, U.

So ""AUDIO"" tests A, U, D, I, O.

But D is a consonant. This word has 4 vowels and one consonant.

Another option: ""ADIEU"" is a common starter, but it has E and we know E is absent, so we cannot use it.

So, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice.

But let me check if ""AUDIO"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

So, I will go with ""AUDIO"".

But note: we must avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""AUDIO"" does not contain any of these.

Therefore, our next guess: AUDIO.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (misplaced).
- **C, R, N, E** are absent (not in the word).

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed present) but **not in position 3**.
- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters and positions to maximize information.

The word **AUDIO** is chosen because:
- It includes **A** in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It introduces 4 new common letters (**U, D, I, O**), covering vowels and consonants.
- It avoids forbidden letters and repeats, helping identify additional correct/absent letters efficiently.

        O: absent

From both feedbacks, we can deduce:

- The letter A is in the word, but not in position 1 (from ""audio"") and not in position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

- The following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We now know the secret word contains A (at least one occurrence) and does not contain any of: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We have to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Includes the letter A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 1 or 3).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We also want to test as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tested yet:
Vowels: We have tested A, E, I, O, U. The only vowel left is possibly Y? But note: A is already in the word, and we know E, I, O, U are absent. So the only vowel we have is A and possibly Y.

Consonants: We have tested C, R, N, D. So we have many left: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: Y can be a vowel or consonant, but in this case, since we are missing vowels, we should consider Y as a vowel possibility.

So the word must have A and possibly Y as the only vowel? Because E, I, O, U are out.

Therefore, the secret word likely has A and maybe Y, and the rest are consonants from the available set.

We should try to cover as many common consonants as possible and also test the position of A.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.

Let's think of words that have A in one of these positions and use only the available letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

We can try:

- A in position 2: 
  - Words: _ A _ _ _
  - Examples: ""BASTY"" (but is that a word? not really), ""PASTY"" (a word, meaning like a pastry), ""HASTY"", ""NASTY"" (but N is out), ""MASTY"" (not common). 
  - Since N is out, we can try ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> but we haven't tested H, S, T, Y. And A in position 2.

- A in position 4:
  - Words: _ _ _ A _
  - Examples: ""PLANT"" (N out), ""SLANT"" (N out), ""BLAST"" (but we have A in position 4? B, L, A, S, T -> A is in position 3? Wait, let's index: position 1: B, 2: L, 3: A, 4: S, 5: T -> but we know A cannot be in position 3. So we need A in position 4. 
  - How about ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P -> A is in position 3? No, that's position 3 again. We need position 4: so the fourth letter is A. 
  - Example: ""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but I is out. 
  - ""FOCAL"" -> O and C out. 
  - ""LYCRA"" -> L, Y, C, R, A -> C and R out. 
  - It's tricky. How about ""BYLAW"": B, Y, L, A, W -> A in position 4. This uses B, Y, L, W. And avoids forbidden letters.

- A in position 5:
  - Words: _ _ _ _ A
  - Examples: ""PIZZA"" (Z is not common, and we have I out), ""TABLA"" (T, A, B, L, A -> duplicate A? and A in position 2 and 5, but we don't know if duplicate is allowed). 
  - ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N out. 
  - ""ALGAE"" -> E out and A in position 1 which we know is not allowed? Actually, in ""ALGAE"", A is in position 1 and 5? But we know A cannot be in position 1. 
  - We need a word with A only at the end. 
  - Example: ""ULTRA"" -> U and R out. 
  - ""EXTRA"" -> E and R out. 
  - ""OCTAL"" -> O and C out. 
  - ""FATWA"": F, A, T, W, A -> A in position 2 and 5? But we can have A at the end. However, we are testing A in position 5. But note: we also have A in position 2, which we know is a possible position? But we don't know if the word has two A's. 
  - Alternatively, ""SALSA"": S, A, L, S, A -> A in position 2 and 5, and duplicate S. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. 

Given the constraints, let's list some candidate words that are valid and avoid the forbidden letters and have A in position 2, 4, or 5.

Candidate 1: ""HASTY"" 
  - H, A, S, T, Y
  - A in position 2
  - Tests H, S, T, Y (all new) and A (which we know is present, but we are testing position 2)

Candidate 2: ""PASTY""
  - P, A, S, T, Y
  - A in position 2
  - Tests P, S, T, Y

Candidate 3: ""BYLAW""
  - B, Y, L, A, W
  - A in position 4
  - Tests B, Y, L, W

Candidate 4: ""GAMMA"" 
  - G, A, M, M, A -> but duplicate M and duplicate A? And A is in position 2 and 5. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are testing A in position 2 and 5? But we know A is present, so if we get two A's in feedback, we know there are two. However, it uses duplicate M which might not be efficient for information.

But note: we only have 4 guesses left (since we used 2, and we have 6 total). We want to maximize information.

Another candidate: ""SASSY"" -> but duplicate S and Y, and A is not present? We must include A.

We must include A.

Another idea: ""TAFFY"" -> T, A, F, F, Y -> A in position 2, and duplicate F. But we test T, F, Y.

But duplicate letters might not be ideal because we get less information.

So, let's avoid duplicates if possible.

Therefore, ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY"" are good because they have no duplicates and test 4 new letters.

We can also consider ""SHALT"" -> S, H, A, L, T -> A in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So invalid.

""PLATY"" -> P, L, A, T, Y -> A in position 3? Again, position 3 is invalid.

So for position 2: ""HASTY"", ""PASTY"", ""BAWDY"" (B, A, W, D, Y -> but D is out? D is absent, so we cannot use D). D is absent from the feedback of ""audio"".

In ""audio"", D was marked absent, so we cannot use D.

Similarly, in ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> all are new and not forbidden? 
Forbidden: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. So H, S, T, Y are allowed.

Similarly, ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> same.

But note: we don't know if Y is allowed. We haven't tested it, so it's okay.

Another candidate: ""MAWKY"" (meaning sullen) -> M, A, W, K, Y -> A in position 2. Tests M, W, K, Y.

But ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY"" are more common.

We can also consider A in position 5: 
  ""PHYLA"" -> P, H, Y, L, A -> A in position 5. Tests P, H, Y, L.

But ""PHYLA"" is a word (plural of phylum).

However, we don't know if the word has Y. We need to test it.

But note: we have very few vowels left. Since E, I, O, U are absent, the only vowels can be A and Y (if Y is used as a vowel). So it's important to test Y.

In fact, the secret word might have Y.

So both ""HASTY"" and ""PHYLA"" are good.

But ""HASTY"" has A in position 2, which is one of the possible positions, and tests S and T which are very common.

Similarly, ""PHYLA"" tests P, H, Y, L and A in position 5.

We have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common consonants. S and T are very common.

So ""HASTY"" or ""PASTY"" are good.

But note: we also want to test the position of A. If we put A in position 2, and if it turns out to be correct, we know A is in position 2. If not, then A must be in 4 or 5.

Similarly, if we put A in position 5 and it's correct, we know. But if we put it in position 2 and it's wrong, we still have positions 4 and 5.

But we have to cover as many letters as possible.

I think ""HASTY"" is a good choice because:
- It tests A in position 2 (if it's correct, we get a check, if not, we know it's misplaced and then we know it must be in 4 or 5).
- It tests H, S, T, Y, which are common.

So let's go with ""HASTY"".

But wait, is ""HASTY"" a valid word? Yes.

Therefore, our next guess: HASTY.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **A** is confirmed present but not in positions 1 or 3 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).
- **C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O** are confirmed absent and cannot be used.
- The secret word likely contains **A** and possibly **Y** (as the only untested vowel), with consonants from the remaining pool (B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** in position 2, 4, or 5 to test its location.
- Prioritize testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, H) and the vowel Y.
- Avoid duplicate letters to maximize information gain.

**Why ""HASTY""?**
- Places **A in position 2** (testing one of the valid positions).
- Introduces **H, S, T, Y** (all untested letters; S and T are high-frequency consonants, Y is a key vowel candidate).
- Avoids forbidden letters and repeats, ensuring efficient feedback.
- If **A** is correct in position 2, we get immediate confirmation. If not, we narrow its position to 4 or 5 while checking four new letters.

But we cannot use E, R, etc. Also, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5? But we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don\'t say the secret word has distinct letters, so duplicates are possible. However, in our feedback for ""crane"", we only have one A and it was marked as present, so if there were two A\'s, we might have gotten two marks? But the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we have only one A in ""crane"", we only know that at least one A is present. The secret word might have more than one A.\n\n  But for now, let\'s avoid duplicates to maximize information.\n\n  ""SAULT"": but U, L, T? But we don\'t have E, R? Actually, ""SAULT"" is not a common word. How about ""SALAD""? But that has two A\'s and we don\'t know if that\'s good. Also, we want to avoid known absent letters.\n\n  Let\'s think of ""PAINT"": but N is eliminated, so not allowed.\n\n  ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2.

""BLAZE"" -> E is eliminated.\n\n  ""FOCAL"": F, O, C, A, L -> but C is eliminated, so not allowed.\n\n  ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E is eliminated.\n\n  It\'s getting tricky.\n\n- A in position 5: words like ""PIZZA"", but Z is not common. ""AROMA"" -> but A is repeated and we have R which is eliminated. ""OUTLA"" not a word.\n\n  ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated and A repeated.\n\nGiven the constraints, let\'s try to form a word without the forbidden letters and with A in a position other than 3.\n\nWe can try A in position 1: \n  Without E, R, C, N: \n    Words: AUDIO, AUDIT, AVOID, ATOLL, ATOMS, etc.\n\nAUDIO: A, U, D, I, O -> all new letters and no duplicates. This is a good candidate because it covers 5 new vowels and consonants.\n\nWe can try A in position 2:\n  Words: SALAD (but duplicate A and we don\'t know if duplicate is good, and D is new), \n          PAGAN (but G and N, N is eliminated), \n          MAJOR (but R is eliminated), \n          TABBY (duplicate B? and Y is new), \n          HABIT (H, A, B, I, T) -> no forbidden letters.\n\nHABIT: H, A, B, I, T -> A in position 2, and we get to test H, B, I, T.\n\nSimilarly, we can consider A in position 4: \n  Words: OPTAL (not common), \n          FOCAL (has C, eliminated), \n          LEGAL (has E, eliminated), \n          ROTAL (has R, eliminated), \n          VITAL (V, I, T, A, L) -> no forbidden letters? V, I, T, A, L. So A in position 4.\n\nVITAL: V, I, T, A, L -> covers V, I, T, L and A in position 4.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the secret word has A in position 1,2,4, or 5. We want to test A in a position that we haven\'t tried and that is likely.\n\nSince we have no information about other positions, we can choose a word that tests A in a new position and also tests many common letters.\n\nConsidering the above, two strong candidates are:\n1. AUDIO: tests A in position 1 and U, D, I, O.\n2. HABIT: tests A in position 2 and H, B, I, T.\n\nWe can also consider:\n3. VITAL: tests A in position 4 and V, I, T, L.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more common letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PASTA"" -> but P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A and we don\'t know if that\'s efficient. Also, A is in position 2 and 5. But we know A is present at least once, so if we get two A\'s in the feedback, we know there are two. But it might be better to avoid duplicates to test more letters.\n\nTherefore, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it uses 5 new letters and places A in a new position (position 1). Also, it covers multiple vowels (A, I, O, U) and one consonant (D), which might help us narrow down the vowels in the word.\n\nAlternatively, ""HABIT"" tests more consonants (H, B, T) and one vowel (I) and A.\n\nBut since we know A is in the word, and we don\'t know about vowels, testing multiple vowels might be good.\n\nHowever, note that the feedback for ""crane"" showed that E is absent, so the secret word might have other vowels: A (we know), and possibly I, O, U.\n\nSo ""AUDIO"" tests A, U, D, I, O.\n\nBut D is a consonant. This word has 4 vowels and one consonant.\n\nAnother option: ""ADIEU"" is a common starter, but it has E and we know E is absent, so we cannot use it.\n\nSo, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if ""AUDIO"" is a valid word: yes, it is.\n\nSo, I will go with ""AUDIO"".\n\nBut note: we must avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""AUDIO"" does not contain any of these.\n\nTherefore, our next guess: AUDIO.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **A** is present but not in position 3 (misplaced).\n- **C, R, N, E** are absent (not in the word).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** (since it\'s confirmed present) but **not in position 3**.\n- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters and positions to maximize information.\n\nThe word **AUDIO** is chosen because:\n- It includes **A** in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- It introduces 4 new common letters (**U, D, I, O**), covering vowels and consonants.\n- It avoids forbidden letters and repeats, helping identify additional correct/absent letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>audio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\n1.

But we know A cannot be in position 3. So invalid.\n\n""PLATY"" -> P, L, A, T, Y -> A in position 3? Again, position 3 is invalid.\n\nSo for position 2: ""HASTY"", ""PASTY"", ""BAWDY"" (B, A, W, D, Y -> but D is out? D is absent, so we cannot use D). D is absent from the feedback of ""audio"".\n\nIn ""audio"", D was marked absent, so we cannot use D.\n\nSimilarly, in ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> all are new and not forbidden? \nForbidden: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. So H, S, T, Y are allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> same.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if Y is allowed. We haven\'t tested it, so it\'s okay.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MAWKY"" (meaning sullen) -> M, A, W, K, Y -> A in position 2. Tests M, W, K, Y.\n\nBut ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY"" are more common.\n\nWe can also consider A in position 5: \n  ""PHYLA"" -> P, H, Y, L, A -> A in position 5. Tests P, H, Y, L.\n\nBut ""PHYLA"" is a word (plural of phylum).\n\nHowever, we don\'t know if the word has Y. We need to test it.\n\nBut note: we have very few vowels left. Since E, I, O, U are absent, the only vowels can be A and Y (if Y is used as a vowel). So it\'s important to test Y.\n\nIn fact, the secret word might have Y.\n\nSo both ""HASTY"" and ""PHYLA"" are good.\n\nBut ""HASTY"" has A in position 2, which is one of the possible positions, and tests S and T which are very common.\n\nSimilarly, ""PHYLA"" tests P, H, Y, L and A in position 5.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common consonants. S and T are very common.\n\nSo ""HASTY"" or ""PASTY"" are good.\n\nBut note: we also want to test the position of A. If we put A in position 2, and if it turns out to be correct, we know A is in position 2. If not, then A must be in 4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, if we put A in position 5 and it\'s correct, we know. But if we put it in position 2 and it\'s wrong, we still have positions 4 and 5.\n\nBut we have to cover as many letters as possible.\n\nI think ""HASTY"" is a good choice because:\n- It tests A in position 2 (if it\'s correct, we get a check, if not, we know it\'s misplaced and then we know it must be in 4 or 5).\n- It tests H, S, T, Y, which are common.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""HASTY"".\n\nBut wait, is ""HASTY"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nTherefore, our next guess: HASTY.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **A** is confirmed present but not in positions 1 or 3 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).\n- **C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O** are confirmed absent and cannot be used.\n- The secret word likely contains **A** and possibly **Y** (as the only untested vowel), with consonants from the remaining pool (B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** in position 2, 4, or 5 to test its location.\n- Prioritize testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, H) and the vowel Y.\n- Avoid duplicate letters to maximize information gain.\n\n**Why ""HASTY""?**\n- Places **A in position 2** (testing one of the valid positions).\n- Introduces **H, S, T, Y** (all untested letters; S and T are high-frequency consonants, Y is a key vowel candidate).\n- Avoids forbidden letters and repeats, ensuring efficient feedback.\n- If **A** is correct in position 2, we get immediate confirmation. If not, we narrow its position to 4 or 5 while checking four new letters.\n\n<guess>hasty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: hasty -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) S(x) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - A is present but not in position 3.

2. ""audio"" -> A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
   - A is present but not in position 1.

3. ""hasty"" -> H(x) A(✓) S(x) T(✓) Y(✓)
   - A is correct in position 2 (so the second letter is A).
   - T is correct in position 4 (so the fourth letter is T).
   - Y is correct in position 5 (so the fifth letter is Y).
   - H and S are absent.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the second letter A, fourth letter T, and fifth letter Y. So the word pattern is: _ A _ T Y
- The first and third letters are unknown, but we know:
  - The first letter cannot be H, and the third letter cannot be S (since S is absent).
- Additionally, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

We also know that A is in the word, but we already have it in position 2, and T and Y are also in the word and correctly placed.

Now, we need to find a word that fits the pattern _ A _ T Y.

The missing letters are the first and third positions.

We must avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's list possible letters for the first and third positions.

Available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tested or that are not absent:
We have tested: A, C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, T, Y.

But note: T and Y are in the word and placed, so they are present. But we are only missing two letters.

The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

So available letters: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We also have A, T, Y, but they are already placed, so we don't need to use them again unless the word has duplicates? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now. Since A, T, Y are already in the word, we cannot use them again in the first or third position.

Therefore, the first and third positions must be filled with two distinct letters from: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Now, we need to form a word: [letter1] A [letter3] T Y

We can try to think of common words that end with ""ATY"" but note the pattern is _ A _ T Y, so the last three are A, then a letter, then T, Y? No: the word is: position 1: ?, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: T, 5: Y.

So the word has the form: ?A?TY

Common words that end with ""TY"" are often like ""party"", ""dirty"", but we have ""A"" in the second position.

Let's think of words that have the pattern: _ A _ T Y

Examples:
- PARTY: P, A, R, T, Y -> but R is absent (from guess1: R(x)), so not allowed.
- DARTY: D is absent (from guess2: D(x)), and R absent.
- BATTY: B, A, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And in position 3 we have T? Let's see: B (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), Y (5). But we need position 4 to be T, which it is, but position 3 is T. However, we have two T's? But the feedback for ""hasty"" had T in position 4 and 5? No, in ""hasty"": H, A, S, T, Y -> position 4 is T and position 5 is Y. So in the secret word, position 4 is T and 5 is Y. In ""BATTY"", we have T in position 3 and 4? That would be: position 3: T, position 4: T? But we need position 4 to be T, which is fine, but position 3 is T. However, we don't know if T can be in position 3. Also, we have two T's? But the feedback for ""hasty"" only showed one T (in position 4) and one Y (in position 5). If the secret word has two T's, then when we guessed ""hasty"", which has one T in position 4, we would have gotten a check for that T, but if there is another T in position 3, it would have been marked as absent or misplaced? In ""hasty"", we have S in position 3, which was absent. If the secret word had a T in position 3, then when we guessed ""hasty"", the T in position 4 would be correct (which it was), but the T in position 3 of the secret word would not be reflected because we didn't guess a T in position 3. We guessed S in position 3, which is absent, so no issue. So it is possible for the secret word to have a T in position 3? But we don't have any information about position 3 except that it cannot be S (from ""hasty"" feedback: S(x)) and cannot be the absent letters.

But in ""BATTY"", we have T in position 3. However, we also have T in position 4. The word ""BATTY"" is valid. But we must check if the letters are allowed: B is available, A is already in position 2, T in position 3 and 4? But we are going to put T in position 3? But we know position 4 is T, so if we put T in position 3, that's a duplicate. But is duplicate allowed? We don't know. The rules don't prohibit duplicates. However, in the feedback for ""hasty"", we only got one T marked as correct (position 4), but that doesn't tell us if there is another T. Similarly, we got Y correct in position 5, but no information about other Y's.

But in this case, for ""BATTY"", the pattern would be: B (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), Y (5). So position 3 is T and position 4 is T. Now, when we guessed ""hasty"", which has S in position 3 (absent) and T in position 4 (correct). The secret word's T in position 3 was not guessed, so it didn't show up. That's fine. But we don't know if the word has two T's.

However, we are trying to guess the word, so we can consider ""BATTY"" as a candidate.

But we must avoid absent letters. B is available, T is already in the word (but we are using it again, which is allowed if duplicates are allowed). Y is also in the word.

But let's see the available letters for the missing positions: we need a letter for position 1 and position 3.

In ""BATTY"", position 1 is B, position 3 is T.

But T is already in position 4. Is that allowed? Yes, if the word has two T's.

But we don't have any evidence against duplicates.

Other candidates:

- PATTY: P, A, T, T, Y -> similar to BATTY, but position 3 is T and position 4 is T? Pattern: P(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5). But we need position 4 to be T, which it is. But again, duplicate T.

- MARTY: M, A, R, T, Y -> but R is absent.

- CATTY: C is absent.

- FATTY: F, A, T, T, Y -> F is available? F is not in the absent list. So FATTY is a candidate.

But again, duplicate T.

- WARTY: W, A, R, T, Y -> R absent.

- PARTY: R absent.

- DATTY: D absent.

- GATTY: G, A, T, T, Y -> G available.

But all these have duplicate T.

Are there words without duplicate T?

For example, words with different letters:

- BALTY? Not a word.

- PALTY? Not a word.

- MALTY: M, A, L, T, Y -> M(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5). This has no duplicate. And L is available.

Similarly, ""SALTY"": but S is absent.

""KATTY"" -> duplicate T? K, A, T, T, Y -> duplicate.

""VATTY"" -> not common.

""JAZZY"" -> J, A, Z, Z, Y -> but we need T in position 4? No, position 4 must be T.

The word must have T in position 4 and Y in position 5.

So the third letter can be something else.

Another word: ""TAWNY"" -> T, A, W, N, Y -> but T is in position 1? We need position 1 to be unknown, but in ""TAWNY"", position 1 is T, but we don't know if T can be in position 1? Also, we have A in position 2, which is correct, but position 3 is W, position 4 is N? But N is absent. And we need position 4 to be T, but it's N. So not.

""TASTY"" -> T, A, S, T, Y -> but S is absent, and T in position 1 and 4? Duplicate T, and S absent.

Back to ""MALTY"": M, A, L, T, Y -> this seems valid. M is available, L is available, T and Y are placed.

Similarly, ""PALTY"" is not a word, but ""PALSY"" is a word but ends with SY, not TY.

""WALTZ"" -> ends with Z, not TY.

""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> but we need position 4 to be T, but it's M. So not.

We need position 4 to be T, so the word must end with ""TY"", but with a letter in between? The pattern is ?A?TY, so the last three letters are ? T Y, but the ? is the third letter.

So the word is: [1]A[3]TY

So the third letter is before T.

Words: 
- MALTY: M A L T Y -> valid, meaning like malt.
- SALTY: but S absent.
- HALTY: not a word.
- CALTY: not a word.
- GALTY: not a word.
- PALTY: not a word.
- VALTY: not a word.
- WALTY: not a word.

Another one: ""DAFTY"" -> D absent.

""RAFTY"" -> R absent.

""HAFTY"" -> H absent.

""TAFTY"" -> T in position 1? Then A in 2, F in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. But duplicate T? And T in position 1 and 4. But we don't know if T can be in position 1. Also, F is available. But let's see: T(1), A(2), F(3), T(4), Y(5). This is ""TAFTY"" – is that a word? Not really, I think.

""KAPUT"" -> doesn't end with TY.

Perhaps ""BATTY"", ""FATTY"", ""PATTY"", ""MARTY"" (but R absent), ""CATTY"" (C absent), ""NATTY"" (N absent), ""RATTY"" (R absent), ""TATTY"" (T in position 1 and 4? duplicate).

But ""MALTY"" seems a valid option.

Another word: ""PANTY"" -> P, A, N, T, Y -> but N is absent.

""WANTY"" -> not common, and N? W, A, N, T, Y -> N absent.

""JANTY"" -> J, A, N, T, Y -> N absent.

""FASTY"" -> F, A, S, T, Y -> S absent.

So, with the available letters, ""MALTY"" is a candidate: M, A, L, T, Y.

We also have ""GALTY"" not a word, but ""GATTY"" is not standard.

""BALKY"" -> B, A, L, K, Y -> but we need position 4 to be T, but it's K. So not.

""PALMY"" -> P, A, L, M, Y -> position 4 is M, not T.

So, ""MALTY"" seems a good candidate.

But is there another word? What about ""BALMY""? No, because position 4 is M.

""TALKY"" -> T, A, L, K, Y -> position 1 is T, position 4 is K, not T.

We need position 4 to be T.

Another possibility: ""WASPY"" -> but S absent, and no T.

Perhaps we missed a word. Let's think of ""PARTY"" but R absent.

Maybe ""BAWTY""? Not a word.

Or ""MAWKY"" -> M, A, W, K, Y -> no T in position 4.

I think ""MALTY"" is one of the few options.

But let's confirm: ""malty"" is an adjective relating to malt, so it's valid.

Another word: ""PALTRY"" is 6 letters, too long.

So, we'll go with ""MALTY"".

But note: in ""MALTY"", the third letter is L. We don't have any information about L, so it might be present.

Also, we are testing M in position 1 and L in position 3.

If this is not the word, we get feedback on M and L.

But we have only 3 guesses left (since we used 3, and 6 total), so we can try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests more common letters, but we only have two positions to fill.

Another candidate: ""FAVTY"" not a word.

""JAVTY"" no.

Perhaps ""BATTY"" with duplicate T.

But let's see the feedback we got: in ""hasty"", we had T in position 4 correct, but if the secret word has T in position 3, we wouldn't know. But we have no evidence for or against duplicate T.

But to be safe, we can try ""MALTY"" first.

If we are wrong, we get feedback on M and L.

But there is another word: ""WALTZ"" is 5 letters but ends with Z, not Y.

I think ""MALTY"" is acceptable.

So, our guess: MALTY.

But let's double-check the pattern: M (1), A (2), L (3), T (4), Y (5). Matches _ A _ T Y.

And letters: M, L are not in the absent list.

So, we'll go with that.
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is misplaced (not in position 3), and C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (audio)**: A is misplaced (not in position 1), and U, D, I, O are absent.
- **Guess 3 (hasty)**: 
  - A is correct in position 2 (so the second letter is **A**).
  - T is correct in position 4 (so the fourth letter is **T**).
  - Y is correct in position 5 (so the fifth letter is **Y**).
  - H and S are absent.

### Deductions:
- The secret word pattern is: **? A ? T Y** (positions: 1=unknown, 2=A, 3=unknown, 4=T, 5=Y).
- **Absent letters** (cannot be used): C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.
- **Available letters** for positions 1 and 3: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since A, T, Y are already placed and duplicates are possible but unconfirmed).
- The word must include **A**, **T**, and **Y** in their fixed positions, with no other vowels possible (E, I, O, U are absent; Y is the only other vowel candidate and is already placed).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with available letters to form a valid English word.
- Prioritize common consonants (e.g., L, M, P) to test likely candidates.
- **Top candidate word**: **MALTY** (M in position 1, L in position 3). This word:
  - Fits the pattern `? A ? T Y` as `M A L T Y`.
  - Uses available letters (M and L not in absent list).
  - Tests two new high-frequency consonants (M and L).
  - Is a valid English word (meaning ""having the flavor of malt"").
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on M and L will narrow options (e.g., if M or L is absent, we can pivot to other words like `BATTY` or `PATTY` in future guesses).

<guess>malty</guess>",malty,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - A is present but not in position 3.

2. ""audio"" -> A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
   - A is present but not in position 1.

3. ""hasty"" -> H(x) A(✓) S(x) T(✓) Y(✓)
   - A is correct in position 2 (so the second letter is A).
   - T is correct in position 4 (so the fourth letter is T).
   - Y is correct in position 5 (so the fifth letter is Y).
   - H and S are absent.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the second letter A, fourth letter T, and fifth letter Y. So the word pattern is: _ A _ T Y
- The first and third letters are unknown, but we know:
  - The first letter cannot be H, and the third letter cannot be S (since S is absent).
- Additionally, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

We also know that A is in the word, but we already have it in position 2, and T and Y are also in the word and correctly placed.

Now, we need to find a word that fits the pattern _ A _ T Y.

The missing letters are the first and third positions.

We must avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's list possible letters for the first and third positions.

Available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tested or that are not absent:
We have tested: A, C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, T, Y.

But note: T and Y are in the word and placed, so they are present. But we are only missing two letters.

The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

So available letters: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We also have A, T, Y, but they are already placed, so we don't need to use them again unless the word has duplicates? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now. Since A, T, Y are already in the word, we cannot use them again in the first or third position.

Therefore, the first and third positions must be filled with two distinct letters from: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Now, we need to form a word: [letter1] A [letter3] T Y

We can try to think of common words that end with ""ATY"" but note the pattern is _ A _ T Y, so the last three are A, then a letter, then T, Y? No: the word is: position 1: ?, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: T, 5: Y.

So the word has the form: ?A?TY

Common words that end with ""TY"" are often like ""party"", ""dirty"", but we have ""A"" in the second position.

Let's think of words that have the pattern: _ A _ T Y

Examples:
- PARTY: P, A, R, T, Y -> but R is absent (from guess1: R(x)), so not allowed.
- DARTY: D is absent (from guess2: D(x)), and R absent.
- BATTY: B, A, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And in position 3 we have T? Let's see: B (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), Y (5). But we need position 4 to be T, which it is, but position 3 is T. However, we have two T's? But the feedback for ""hasty"" had T in position 4 and 5? No, in ""hasty"": H, A, S, T, Y -> position 4 is T and position 5 is Y. So in the secret word, position 4 is T and 5 is Y. In ""BATTY"", we have T in position 3 and 4? That would be: position 3: T, position 4: T? But we need position 4 to be T, which is fine, but position 3 is T. However, we don't know if T can be in position 3. Also, we have two T's? But the feedback for ""hasty"" only showed one T (in position 4) and one Y (in position 5). If the secret word has two T's, then when we guessed ""hasty"", which has one T in position 4, we would have gotten a check for that T, but if there is another T in position 3, it would have been marked as absent or misplaced? In ""hasty"", we have S in position 3, which was absent. If the secret word had a T in position 3, then when we guessed ""hasty"", the T in position 4 would be correct (which it was), but the T in position 3 of the secret word would not be reflected because we didn't guess a T in position 3. We guessed S in position 3, which is absent, so no issue. So it is possible for the secret word to have a T in position 3? But we don't have any information about position 3 except that it cannot be S (from ""hasty"" feedback: S(x)) and cannot be the absent letters.

But in ""BATTY"", we have T in position 3. However, we also have T in position 4. The word ""BATTY"" is valid. But we must check if the letters are allowed: B is available, A is already in position 2, T in position 3 and 4? But we are going to put T in position 3? But we know position 4 is T, so if we put T in position 3, that's a duplicate. But is duplicate allowed? We don't know. The rules don't prohibit duplicates. However, in the feedback for ""hasty"", we only got one T marked as correct (position 4), but that doesn't tell us if there is another T. Similarly, we got Y correct in position 5, but no information about other Y's.

But in this case, for ""BATTY"", the pattern would be: B (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), Y (5). So position 3 is T and position 4 is T. Now, when we guessed ""hasty"", which has S in position 3 (absent) and T in position 4 (correct). The secret word's T in position 3 was not guessed, so it didn't show up. That's fine. But we don't know if the word has two T's.

However, we are trying to guess the word, so we can consider ""BATTY"" as a candidate.

But we must avoid absent letters. B is available, T is already in the word (but we are using it again, which is allowed if duplicates are allowed). Y is also in the word.

But let's see the available letters for the missing positions: we need a letter for position 1 and position 3.

In ""BATTY"", position 1 is B, position 3 is T.

But T is already in position 4. Is that allowed? Yes, if the word has two T's.

But we don't have any evidence against duplicates.

Other candidates:

- PATTY: P, A, T, T, Y -> similar to BATTY, but position 3 is T and position 4 is T? Pattern: P(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5). But we need position 4 to be T, which it is. But again, duplicate T.

- MARTY: M, A, R, T, Y -> but R is absent.

- CATTY: C is absent.

- FATTY: F, A, T, T, Y -> F is available? F is not in the absent list. So FATTY is a candidate.

But again, duplicate T.

- WARTY: W, A, R, T, Y -> R absent.

- PARTY: R absent.

- DATTY: D absent.

- GATTY: G, A, T, T, Y -> G available.

But all these have duplicate T.

Are there words without duplicate T?

For example, words with different letters:

- BALTY? Not a word.

- PALTY? Not a word.

- MALTY: M, A, L, T, Y -> M(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5). This has no duplicate. And L is available.

Similarly, ""SALTY"": but S is absent.

""KATTY"" -> duplicate T? K, A, T, T, Y -> duplicate.

""VATTY"" -> not common.

""JAZZY"" -> J, A, Z, Z, Y -> but we need T in position 4? No, position 4 must be T.

The word must have T in position 4 and Y in position 5.

So the third letter can be something else.

Another word: ""TAWNY"" -> T, A, W, N, Y -> but T is in position 1? We need position 1 to be unknown, but in ""TAWNY"", position 1 is T, but we don't know if T can be in position 1? Also, we have A in position 2, which is correct, but position 3 is W, position 4 is N? But N is absent. And we need position 4 to be T, but it's N. So not.

""TASTY"" -> T, A, S, T, Y -> but S is absent, and T in position 1 and 4? Duplicate T, and S absent.

Back to ""MALTY"": M, A, L, T, Y -> this seems valid. M is available, L is available, T and Y are placed.

Similarly, ""PALTY"" is not a word, but ""PALSY"" is a word but ends with SY, not TY.

""WALTZ"" -> ends with Z, not TY.

""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> but we need position 4 to be T, but it's M. So not.

We need position 4 to be T, so the word must end with ""TY"", but with a letter in between? The pattern is ?A?TY, so the last three letters are ? T Y, but the ? is the third letter.

So the word is: [1]A[3]TY

So the third letter is before T.

Words: 
- MALTY: M A L T Y -> valid, meaning like malt.
- SALTY: but S absent.
- HALTY: not a word.
- CALTY: not a word.
- GALTY: not a word.
- PALTY: not a word.
- VALTY: not a word.
- WALTY: not a word.

Another one: ""DAFTY"" -> D absent.

""RAFTY"" -> R absent.

""HAFTY"" -> H absent.

""TAFTY"" -> T in position 1? Then A in 2, F in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. But duplicate T? And T in position 1 and 4. But we don't know if T can be in position 1. Also, F is available. But let's see: T(1), A(2), F(3), T(4), Y(5). This is ""TAFTY"" – is that a word? Not really, I think.

""KAPUT"" -> doesn't end with TY.

Perhaps ""BATTY"", ""FATTY"", ""PATTY"", ""MARTY"" (but R absent), ""CATTY"" (C absent), ""NATTY"" (N absent), ""RATTY"" (R absent), ""TATTY"" (T in position 1 and 4? duplicate).

But ""MALTY"" seems a valid option.

Another word: ""PANTY"" -> P, A, N, T, Y -> but N is absent.

""WANTY"" -> not common, and N? W, A, N, T, Y -> N absent.

""JANTY"" -> J, A, N, T, Y -> N absent.

""FASTY"" -> F, A, S, T, Y -> S absent.

So, with the available letters, ""MALTY"" is a candidate: M, A, L, T, Y.

We also have ""GALTY"" not a word, but ""GATTY"" is not standard.

""BALKY"" -> B, A, L, K, Y -> but we need position 4 to be T, but it's K. So not.

""PALMY"" -> P, A, L, M, Y -> position 4 is M, not T.

So, ""MALTY"" seems a good candidate.

But is there another word? What about ""BALMY""? No, because position 4 is M.

""TALKY"" -> T, A, L, K, Y -> position 1 is T, position 4 is K, not T.

We need position 4 to be T.

Another possibility: ""WASPY"" -> but S absent, and no T.

Perhaps we missed a word. Let's think of ""PARTY"" but R absent.

Maybe ""BAWTY""? Not a word.

Or ""MAWKY"" -> M, A, W, K, Y -> no T in position 4.

I think ""MALTY"" is one of the few options.

But let's confirm: ""malty"" is an adjective relating to malt, so it's valid.

Another word: ""PALTRY"" is 6 letters, too long.

So, we'll go with ""MALTY"".

But note: in ""MALTY"", the third letter is L. We don't have any information about L, so it might be present.

Also, we are testing M in position 1 and L in position 3.

If this is not the word, we get feedback on M and L.

But we have only 3 guesses left (since we used 3, and 6 total), so we can try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests more common letters, but we only have two positions to fill.

Another candidate: ""FAVTY"" not a word.

""JAVTY"" no.

Perhaps ""BATTY"" with duplicate T.

But let's see the feedback we got: in ""hasty"", we had T in position 4 correct, but if the secret word has T in position 3, we wouldn't know. But we have no evidence for or against duplicate T.

But to be safe, we can try ""MALTY"" first.

If we are wrong, we get feedback on M and L.

But there is another word: ""WALTZ"" is 5 letters but ends with Z, not Y.

I think ""MALTY"" is acceptable.

So, our guess: MALTY.

But let's double-check the pattern: M (1), A (2), L (3), T (4), Y (5). Matches _ A _ T Y.

And letters: M, L are not in the absent list.

So, we'll go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is misplaced (not in position 3), and C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (audio)**: A is misplaced (not in position 1), and U, D, I, O are absent.
- **Guess 3 (hasty)**: 
  - A is correct in position 2 (so the second letter is **A**).
  - T is correct in position 4 (so the fourth letter is **T**).
  - Y is correct in position 5 (so the fifth letter is **Y**).
  - H and S are absent.

### Deductions:
- The secret word pattern is: **? A ? T Y** (positions: 1=unknown, 2=A, 3=unknown, 4=T, 5=Y).
- **Absent letters** (cannot be used): C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.
- **Available letters** for positions 1 and 3: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since A, T, Y are already placed and duplicates are possible but unconfirmed).
- The word must include **A**, **T**, and **Y** in their fixed positions, with no other vowels possible (E, I, O, U are absent; Y is the only other vowel candidate and is already placed).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with available letters to form a valid English word.
- Prioritize common consonants (e.g., L, M, P) to test likely candidates.
- **Top candidate word**: **MALTY** (M in position 1, L in position 3). This word:
  - Fits the pattern `? A ? T Y` as `M A L T Y`.
  - Uses available letters (M and L not in absent list).
  - Tests two new high-frequency consonants (M and L).
  - Is a valid English word (meaning ""having the flavor of malt"").
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on M and L will narrow options (e.g., if M or L is absent, we can pivot to other words like `BATTY` or `PATTY` in future guesses).",Guess 4: malty -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) L(x) T(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since this is the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback. 
 We need to choose a 5-letter English word. It's good to pick a word that covers common letters to get maximum information.

 Common vowels and consonants are a good start. Words with a lot of vowels might not cover as many consonants. 
 Alternatively, words with common consonants and vowels can be helpful.

 Some common starting words in Wordle are:
 - CRANE, SLATE, CRATE, STARE, ADIEU, etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 1 vowel (A, E). 
 But note: the feedback format uses ✓, -, and x. We want to maximize the information we get.

 However, note the example: ""STORM"" for secret word ""BRISK"" gave feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x).

 The word ""CRANE"":
  - C: common consonant
  - R: common consonant
  - A: common vowel
  - N: common consonant
  - E: common vowel

 This word covers 4 distinct consonants and 2 vowels (with E at the end). It's a balanced word.

 Another common strategy is to pick words without repeated letters. ""CRANE"" has no repeated letters.

 So let's go with ""CRANE"".After analyzing the game rules and considering common strategies for initial guesses in word games, I chose a word that includes frequent vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. ""CRANE"" is effective because it contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), helping identify letter presence/absence quickly.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, and it is not in the third position. Also, we must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.

We need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E.
- Includes the letter A, but not in the third position.

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have the letter A and avoid the forbidden letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

One common strategy is to try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common consonants.

Possible positions for A: since it can't be in position 3, we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's list some candidate words:

- A in position 1: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""APART"", ""APPLE"", etc.
  But note: we cannot use E (from ABOUT, ABOVE, AFTER, APART) because E is eliminated. Also, we cannot use R (in ABOUT, AFTER, APART) because R is eliminated.

  So, we need words without E and R.

  For example: 
    ""ALONG"": A, L, O, N, G -> but N is eliminated, so not allowed.
    ""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E -> E is eliminated and also repeated P? But the word is valid, but we cannot use E. So not allowed.

  Let's try ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> all new letters? But we don't know if they are in the word. This word has A in position 1 and avoids the forbidden letters.

- A in position 2: words like ""PASTA"", but S and T are new, but we have A in position 2 and then T in position 3? But we cannot use E, R, etc. Also, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5? But we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don't say the secret word has distinct letters, so duplicates are possible. However, in our feedback for ""crane"", we only have one A and it was marked as present, so if there were two A's, we might have gotten two marks? But the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we have only one A in ""crane"", we only know that at least one A is present. The secret word might have more than one A.

  But for now, let's avoid duplicates to maximize information.

  ""SAULT"": but U, L, T? But we don't have E, R? Actually, ""SAULT"" is not a common word. How about ""SALAD""? But that has two A's and we don't know if that's good. Also, we want to avoid known absent letters.

  Let's think of ""PAINT"": but N is eliminated, so not allowed.

  ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. This avoids forbidden letters.

- A in position 4: words like ""PLANT"" -> but N is eliminated, so not allowed. ""TRACK"" -> R and C are eliminated. ""BLAZE"" -> E is eliminated.

  ""FOCAL"": F, O, C, A, L -> but C is eliminated, so not allowed.

  ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E is eliminated.

  It's getting tricky.

- A in position 5: words like ""PIZZA"", but Z is not common. ""AROMA"" -> but A is repeated and we have R which is eliminated. ""OUTLA"" not a word.

  ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated and A repeated.

Given the constraints, let's try to form a word without the forbidden letters and with A in a position other than 3.

We can try A in position 1: 
  Without E, R, C, N: 
    Words: AUDIO, AUDIT, AVOID, ATOLL, ATOMS, etc.

AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O -> all new letters and no duplicates. This is a good candidate because it covers 5 new vowels and consonants.

We can try A in position 2:
  Words: SALAD (but duplicate A and we don't know if duplicate is good, and D is new), 
          PAGAN (but G and N, N is eliminated), 
          MAJOR (but R is eliminated), 
          TABBY (duplicate B? and Y is new), 
          HABIT (H, A, B, I, T) -> no forbidden letters.

HABIT: H, A, B, I, T -> A in position 2, and we get to test H, B, I, T.

Similarly, we can consider A in position 4: 
  Words: OPTAL (not common), 
          FOCAL (has C, eliminated), 
          LEGAL (has E, eliminated), 
          ROTAL (has R, eliminated), 
          VITAL (V, I, T, A, L) -> no forbidden letters? V, I, T, A, L. So A in position 4.

VITAL: V, I, T, A, L -> covers V, I, T, L and A in position 4.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has A in position 1,2,4, or 5. We want to test A in a position that we haven't tried and that is likely.

Since we have no information about other positions, we can choose a word that tests A in a new position and also tests many common letters.

Considering the above, two strong candidates are:
1. AUDIO: tests A in position 1 and U, D, I, O.
2. HABIT: tests A in position 2 and H, B, I, T.

We can also consider:
3. VITAL: tests A in position 4 and V, I, T, L.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more common letters.

Another candidate: ""PASTA"" -> but P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A and we don't know if that's efficient. Also, A is in position 2 and 5. But we know A is present at least once, so if we get two A's in the feedback, we know there are two. But it might be better to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Therefore, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it uses 5 new letters and places A in a new position (position 1). Also, it covers multiple vowels (A, I, O, U) and one consonant (D), which might help us narrow down the vowels in the word.

Alternatively, ""HABIT"" tests more consonants (H, B, T) and one vowel (I) and A.

But since we know A is in the word, and we don't know about vowels, testing multiple vowels might be good.

However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" showed that E is absent, so the secret word might have other vowels: A (we know), and possibly I, O, U.

So ""AUDIO"" tests A, U, D, I, O.

But D is a consonant. This word has 4 vowels and one consonant.

Another option: ""ADIEU"" is a common starter, but it has E and we know E is absent, so we cannot use it.

So, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice.

But let me check if ""AUDIO"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

So, I will go with ""AUDIO"".

But note: we must avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""AUDIO"" does not contain any of these.

Therefore, our next guess: AUDIO.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (misplaced).
- **C, R, N, E** are absent (not in the word).

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed present) but **not in position 3**.
- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters and positions to maximize information.

The word **AUDIO** is chosen because:
- It includes **A** in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It introduces 4 new common letters (**U, D, I, O**), covering vowels and consonants.
- It avoids forbidden letters and repeats, helping identify additional correct/absent letters efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - This means:
        C: absent (not in the word)
        R: absent
        A: present but not in the 3rd position (since in ""crane"" it was in position 3)
        N: absent
        E: absent

2. ""audio"" -> A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
   - This means:
        A: present but not in the 1st position (since in ""audio"" it was in position 1)
        U: absent
        D: absent
        I: absent
        O: absent

From both feedbacks, we can deduce:

- The letter A is in the word, but not in position 1 (from ""audio"") and not in position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

- The following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We now know the secret word contains A (at least one occurrence) and does not contain any of: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We have to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Includes the letter A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 1 or 3).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We also want to test as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tested yet:
Vowels: We have tested A, E, I, O, U. The only vowel left is possibly Y? But note: A is already in the word, and we know E, I, O, U are absent. So the only vowel we have is A and possibly Y.

Consonants: We have tested C, R, N, D. So we have many left: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: Y can be a vowel or consonant, but in this case, since we are missing vowels, we should consider Y as a vowel possibility.

So the word must have A and possibly Y as the only vowel? Because E, I, O, U are out.

Therefore, the secret word likely has A and maybe Y, and the rest are consonants from the available set.

We should try to cover as many common consonants as possible and also test the position of A.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.

Let's think of words that have A in one of these positions and use only the available letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

We can try:

- A in position 2: 
  - Words: _ A _ _ _
  - Examples: ""BASTY"" (but is that a word? not really), ""PASTY"" (a word, meaning like a pastry), ""HASTY"", ""NASTY"" (but N is out), ""MASTY"" (not common). 
  - Since N is out, we can try ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> but we haven't tested H, S, T, Y. And A in position 2.

- A in position 4:
  - Words: _ _ _ A _
  - Examples: ""PLANT"" (N out), ""SLANT"" (N out), ""BLAST"" (but we have A in position 4? B, L, A, S, T -> A is in position 3? Wait, let's index: position 1: B, 2: L, 3: A, 4: S, 5: T -> but we know A cannot be in position 3. So we need A in position 4. 
  - How about ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P -> A is in position 3? No, that's position 3 again. We need position 4: so the fourth letter is A. 
  - Example: ""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but I is out. 
  - ""FOCAL"" -> O and C out. 
  - ""LYCRA"" -> L, Y, C, R, A -> C and R out. 
  - It's tricky. How about ""BYLAW"": B, Y, L, A, W -> A in position 4. This uses B, Y, L, W. And avoids forbidden letters.

- A in position 5:
  - Words: _ _ _ _ A
  - Examples: ""PIZZA"" (Z is not common, and we have I out), ""TABLA"" (T, A, B, L, A -> duplicate A? and A in position 2 and 5, but we don't know if duplicate is allowed). 
  - ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N out. 
  - ""ALGAE"" -> E out and A in position 1 which we know is not allowed? Actually, in ""ALGAE"", A is in position 1 and 5? But we know A cannot be in position 1. 
  - We need a word with A only at the end. 
  - Example: ""ULTRA"" -> U and R out. 
  - ""EXTRA"" -> E and R out. 
  - ""OCTAL"" -> O and C out. 
  - ""FATWA"": F, A, T, W, A -> A in position 2 and 5? But we can have A at the end. However, we are testing A in position 5. But note: we also have A in position 2, which we know is a possible position? But we don't know if the word has two A's. 
  - Alternatively, ""SALSA"": S, A, L, S, A -> A in position 2 and 5, and duplicate S. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. 

Given the constraints, let's list some candidate words that are valid and avoid the forbidden letters and have A in position 2, 4, or 5.

Candidate 1: ""HASTY"" 
  - H, A, S, T, Y
  - A in position 2
  - Tests H, S, T, Y (all new) and A (which we know is present, but we are testing position 2)

Candidate 2: ""PASTY""
  - P, A, S, T, Y
  - A in position 2
  - Tests P, S, T, Y

Candidate 3: ""BYLAW""
  - B, Y, L, A, W
  - A in position 4
  - Tests B, Y, L, W

Candidate 4: ""GAMMA"" 
  - G, A, M, M, A -> but duplicate M and duplicate A? And A is in position 2 and 5. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are testing A in position 2 and 5? But we know A is present, so if we get two A's in feedback, we know there are two. However, it uses duplicate M which might not be efficient for information.

But note: we only have 4 guesses left (since we used 2, and we have 6 total). We want to maximize information.

Another candidate: ""SASSY"" -> but duplicate S and Y, and A is not present? We must include A.

We must include A.

Another idea: ""TAFFY"" -> T, A, F, F, Y -> A in position 2, and duplicate F. But we test T, F, Y.

But duplicate letters might not be ideal because we get less information.

So, let's avoid duplicates if possible.

Therefore, ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY"" are good because they have no duplicates and test 4 new letters.

We can also consider ""SHALT"" -> S, H, A, L, T -> A in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So invalid.

""PLATY"" -> P, L, A, T, Y -> A in position 3? Again, position 3 is invalid.

So for position 2: ""HASTY"", ""PASTY"", ""BAWDY"" (B, A, W, D, Y -> but D is out? D is absent, so we cannot use D). D is absent from the feedback of ""audio"".

In ""audio"", D was marked absent, so we cannot use D.

Similarly, in ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> all are new and not forbidden? 
Forbidden: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. So H, S, T, Y are allowed.

Similarly, ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> same.

But note: we don't know if Y is allowed. We haven't tested it, so it's okay.

Another candidate: ""MAWKY"" (meaning sullen) -> M, A, W, K, Y -> A in position 2. Tests M, W, K, Y.

But ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY"" are more common.

We can also consider A in position 5: 
  ""PHYLA"" -> P, H, Y, L, A -> A in position 5. Tests P, H, Y, L.

But ""PHYLA"" is a word (plural of phylum).

However, we don't know if the word has Y. We need to test it.

But note: we have very few vowels left. Since E, I, O, U are absent, the only vowels can be A and Y (if Y is used as a vowel). So it's important to test Y.

In fact, the secret word might have Y.

So both ""HASTY"" and ""PHYLA"" are good.

But ""HASTY"" has A in position 2, which is one of the possible positions, and tests S and T which are very common.

Similarly, ""PHYLA"" tests P, H, Y, L and A in position 5.

We have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common consonants. S and T are very common.

So ""HASTY"" or ""PASTY"" are good.

But note: we also want to test the position of A. If we put A in position 2, and if it turns out to be correct, we know A is in position 2. If not, then A must be in 4 or 5.

Similarly, if we put A in position 5 and it's correct, we know. But if we put it in position 2 and it's wrong, we still have positions 4 and 5.

But we have to cover as many letters as possible.

I think ""HASTY"" is a good choice because:
- It tests A in position 2 (if it's correct, we get a check, if not, we know it's misplaced and then we know it must be in 4 or 5).
- It tests H, S, T, Y, which are common.

So let's go with ""HASTY"".

But wait, is ""HASTY"" a valid word? Yes.

Therefore, our next guess: HASTY.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **A** is confirmed present but not in positions 1 or 3 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).
- **C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O** are confirmed absent and cannot be used.
- The secret word likely contains **A** and possibly **Y** (as the only untested vowel), with consonants from the remaining pool (B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** in position 2, 4, or 5 to test its location.
- Prioritize testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, H) and the vowel Y.
- Avoid duplicate letters to maximize information gain.

**Why ""HASTY""?**
- Places **A in position 2** (testing one of the valid positions).
- Introduces **H, S, T, Y** (all untested letters; S and T are high-frequency consonants, Y is a key vowel candidate).
- Avoids forbidden letters and repeats, ensuring efficient feedback.
- If **A** is correct in position 2, we get immediate confirmation. If not, we narrow its position to 4 or 5 while checking four new letters.

<guess>hasty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
Guess 3: hasty -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) S(x) T(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - A is present but not in position 3.

2. ""audio"" -> A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
   - A is present but not in position 1.

3. ""hasty"" -> H(x) A(✓) S(x) T(✓) Y(✓)
   - A is correct in position 2 (so the second letter is A).
   - T is correct in position 4 (so the fourth letter is T).
   - Y is correct in position 5 (so the fifth letter is Y).
   - H and S are absent.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the second letter A, fourth letter T, and fifth letter Y. So the word pattern is: _ A _ T Y
- The first and third letters are unknown, but we know:
  - The first letter cannot be H, and the third letter cannot be S (since S is absent).
- Additionally, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

We also know that A is in the word, but we already have it in position 2, and T and Y are also in the word and correctly placed.

Now, we need to find a word that fits the pattern _ A _ T Y.

The missing letters are the first and third positions.

We must avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's list possible letters for the first and third positions.

Available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tested or that are not absent:
We have tested: A, C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, T, Y.

But note: T and Y are in the word and placed, so they are present. But we are only missing two letters.

The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

So available letters: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We also have A, T, Y, but they are already placed, so we don't need to use them again unless the word has duplicates? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now. Since A, T, Y are already in the word, we cannot use them again in the first or third position.

Therefore, the first and third positions must be filled with two distinct letters from: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Now, we need to form a word: [letter1] A [letter3] T Y

We can try to think of common words that end with ""ATY"" but note the pattern is _ A _ T Y, so the last three are A, then a letter, then T, Y? No: the word is: position 1: ?, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: T, 5: Y.

So the word has the form: ?A?TY

Common words that end with ""TY"" are often like ""party"", ""dirty"", but we have ""A"" in the second position.

Let's think of words that have the pattern: _ A _ T Y

Examples:
- PARTY: P, A, R, T, Y -> but R is absent (from guess1: R(x)), so not allowed.
- DARTY: D is absent (from guess2: D(x)), and R absent.
- BATTY: B, A, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And in position 3 we have T? Let's see: B (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), Y (5). But we need position 4 to be T, which it is, but position 3 is T. However, we have two T's? But the feedback for ""hasty"" had T in position 4 and 5? No, in ""hasty"": H, A, S, T, Y -> position 4 is T and position 5 is Y. So in the secret word, position 4 is T and 5 is Y. In ""BATTY"", we have T in position 3 and 4? That would be: position 3: T, position 4: T? But we need position 4 to be T, which is fine, but position 3 is T. However, we don't know if T can be in position 3. Also, we have two T's? But the feedback for ""hasty"" only showed one T (in position 4) and one Y (in position 5). If the secret word has two T's, then when we guessed ""hasty"", which has one T in position 4, we would have gotten a check for that T, but if there is another T in position 3, it would have been marked as absent or misplaced? In ""hasty"", we have S in position 3, which was absent. If the secret word had a T in position 3, then when we guessed ""hasty"", the T in position 4 would be correct (which it was), but the T in position 3 of the secret word would not be reflected because we didn't guess a T in position 3. We guessed S in position 3, which is absent, so no issue. So it is possible for the secret word to have a T in position 3? But we don't have any information about position 3 except that it cannot be S (from ""hasty"" feedback: S(x)) and cannot be the absent letters.

But in ""BATTY"", we have T in position 3. However, we also have T in position 4. The word ""BATTY"" is valid. But we must check if the letters are allowed: B is available, A is already in position 2, T in position 3 and 4? But we are going to put T in position 3? But we know position 4 is T, so if we put T in position 3, that's a duplicate. But is duplicate allowed? We don't know. The rules don't prohibit duplicates. However, in the feedback for ""hasty"", we only got one T marked as correct (position 4), but that doesn't tell us if there is another T. Similarly, we got Y correct in position 5, but no information about other Y's.

But in this case, for ""BATTY"", the pattern would be: B (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), Y (5). So position 3 is T and position 4 is T. Now, when we guessed ""hasty"", which has S in position 3 (absent) and T in position 4 (correct). The secret word's T in position 3 was not guessed, so it didn't show up. That's fine. But we don't know if the word has two T's.

However, we are trying to guess the word, so we can consider ""BATTY"" as a candidate.

But we must avoid absent letters. B is available, T is already in the word (but we are using it again, which is allowed if duplicates are allowed). Y is also in the word.

But let's see the available letters for the missing positions: we need a letter for position 1 and position 3.

In ""BATTY"", position 1 is B, position 3 is T.

But T is already in position 4. Is that allowed? Yes, if the word has two T's.

But we don't have any evidence against duplicates.

Other candidates:

- PATTY: P, A, T, T, Y -> similar to BATTY, but position 3 is T and position 4 is T? Pattern: P(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5). But we need position 4 to be T, which it is. But again, duplicate T.

- MARTY: M, A, R, T, Y -> but R is absent.

- CATTY: C is absent.

- FATTY: F, A, T, T, Y -> F is available? F is not in the absent list. So FATTY is a candidate.

But again, duplicate T.

- WARTY: W, A, R, T, Y -> R absent.

- PARTY: R absent.

- DATTY: D absent.

- GATTY: G, A, T, T, Y -> G available.

But all these have duplicate T.

Are there words without duplicate T?

For example, words with different letters:

- BALTY? Not a word.

- PALTY? Not a word.

- MALTY: M, A, L, T, Y -> M(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5). This has no duplicate. And L is available.

Similarly, ""SALTY"": but S is absent.

""KATTY"" -> duplicate T? K, A, T, T, Y -> duplicate.

""VATTY"" -> not common.

""JAZZY"" -> J, A, Z, Z, Y -> but we need T in position 4? No, position 4 must be T.

The word must have T in position 4 and Y in position 5.

So the third letter can be something else.

Another word: ""TAWNY"" -> T, A, W, N, Y -> but T is in position 1? We need position 1 to be unknown, but in ""TAWNY"", position 1 is T, but we don't know if T can be in position 1? Also, we have A in position 2, which is correct, but position 3 is W, position 4 is N? But N is absent. And we need position 4 to be T, but it's N. So not.

""TASTY"" -> T, A, S, T, Y -> but S is absent, and T in position 1 and 4? Duplicate T, and S absent.

Back to ""MALTY"": M, A, L, T, Y -> this seems valid. M is available, L is available, T and Y are placed.

Similarly, ""PALTY"" is not a word, but ""PALSY"" is a word but ends with SY, not TY.

""WALTZ"" -> ends with Z, not TY.

""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> but we need position 4 to be T, but it's M. So not.

We need position 4 to be T, so the word must end with ""TY"", but with a letter in between? The pattern is ?A?TY, so the last three letters are ? T Y, but the ? is the third letter.

So the word is: [1]A[3]TY

So the third letter is before T.

Words: 
- MALTY: M A L T Y -> valid, meaning like malt.
- SALTY: but S absent.
- HALTY: not a word.
- CALTY: not a word.
- GALTY: not a word.
- PALTY: not a word.
- VALTY: not a word.
- WALTY: not a word.

Another one: ""DAFTY"" -> D absent.

""RAFTY"" -> R absent.

""HAFTY"" -> H absent.

""TAFTY"" -> T in position 1? Then A in 2, F in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. But duplicate T? And T in position 1 and 4. But we don't know if T can be in position 1. Also, F is available. But let's see: T(1), A(2), F(3), T(4), Y(5). This is ""TAFTY"" – is that a word? Not really, I think.

""KAPUT"" -> doesn't end with TY.

Perhaps ""BATTY"", ""FATTY"", ""PATTY"", ""MARTY"" (but R absent), ""CATTY"" (C absent), ""NATTY"" (N absent), ""RATTY"" (R absent), ""TATTY"" (T in position 1 and 4? duplicate).

But ""MALTY"" seems a valid option.

Another word: ""PANTY"" -> P, A, N, T, Y -> but N is absent.

""WANTY"" -> not common, and N? W, A, N, T, Y -> N absent.

""JANTY"" -> J, A, N, T, Y -> N absent.

""FASTY"" -> F, A, S, T, Y -> S absent.

So, with the available letters, ""MALTY"" is a candidate: M, A, L, T, Y.

We also have ""GALTY"" not a word, but ""GATTY"" is not standard.

""BALKY"" -> B, A, L, K, Y -> but we need position 4 to be T, but it's K. So not.

""PALMY"" -> P, A, L, M, Y -> position 4 is M, not T.

So, ""MALTY"" seems a good candidate.

But is there another word? What about ""BALMY""? No, because position 4 is M.

""TALKY"" -> T, A, L, K, Y -> position 1 is T, position 4 is K, not T.

We need position 4 to be T.

Another possibility: ""WASPY"" -> but S absent, and no T.

Perhaps we missed a word. Let's think of ""PARTY"" but R absent.

Maybe ""BAWTY""? Not a word.

Or ""MAWKY"" -> M, A, W, K, Y -> no T in position 4.

I think ""MALTY"" is one of the few options.

But let's confirm: ""malty"" is an adjective relating to malt, so it's valid.

Another word: ""PALTRY"" is 6 letters, too long.

So, we'll go with ""MALTY"".

But note: in ""MALTY"", the third letter is L. We don't have any information about L, so it might be present.

Also, we are testing M in position 1 and L in position 3.

If this is not the word, we get feedback on M and L.

But we have only 3 guesses left (since we used 3, and 6 total), so we can try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests more common letters, but we only have two positions to fill.

Another candidate: ""FAVTY"" not a word.

""JAVTY"" no.

Perhaps ""BATTY"" with duplicate T.

But let's see the feedback we got: in ""hasty"", we had T in position 4 correct, but if the secret word has T in position 3, we wouldn't know. But we have no evidence for or against duplicate T.

But to be safe, we can try ""MALTY"" first.

If we are wrong, we get feedback on M and L.

But there is another word: ""WALTZ"" is 5 letters but ends with Z, not Y.

I think ""MALTY"" is acceptable.

So, our guess: MALTY.

But let's double-check the pattern: M (1), A (2), L (3), T (4), Y (5). Matches _ A _ T Y.

And letters: M, L are not in the absent list.

So, we'll go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is misplaced (not in position 3), and C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (audio)**: A is misplaced (not in position 1), and U, D, I, O are absent.
- **Guess 3 (hasty)**: 
  - A is correct in position 2 (so the second letter is **A**).
  - T is correct in position 4 (so the fourth letter is **T**).
  - Y is correct in position 5 (so the fifth letter is **Y**).
  - H and S are absent.

### Deductions:
- The secret word pattern is: **? A ? T Y** (positions: 1=unknown, 2=A, 3=unknown, 4=T, 5=Y).
- **Absent letters** (cannot be used): C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.
- **Available letters** for positions 1 and 3: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since A, T, Y are already placed and duplicates are possible but unconfirmed).
- The word must include **A**, **T**, and **Y** in their fixed positions, with no other vowels possible (E, I, O, U are absent; Y is the only other vowel candidate and is already placed).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with available letters to form a valid English word.
- Prioritize common consonants (e.g., L, M, P) to test likely candidates.
- **Top candidate word**: **MALTY** (M in position 1, L in position 3). This word:
  - Fits the pattern `? A ? T Y` as `M A L T Y`.
  - Uses available letters (M and L not in absent list).
  - Tests two new high-frequency consonants (M and L).
  - Is a valid English word (meaning ""having the flavor of malt"").
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on M and L will narrow options (e.g., if M or L is absent, we can pivot to other words like `BATTY` or `PATTY` in future guesses).

Also, we cannot use R (in ABOUT, AFTER, APART) because R is eliminated.\n\n  So, we need words without E and R.\n\n  For example: \n    ""ALONG"": A, L, O, N, G -> but N is eliminated, so not allowed.\n    ""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E -> E is eliminated and also repeated P?

But we cannot use E, R, etc. Also, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5? But we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don\'t say the secret word has distinct letters, so duplicates are possible. However, in our feedback for ""crane"", we only have one A and it was marked as present, so if there were two A\'s, we might have gotten two marks? But the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we have only one A in ""crane"", we only know that at least one A is present. The secret word might have more than one A.\n\n  But for now, let\'s avoid duplicates to maximize information.\n\n  ""SAULT"": but U, L, T? But we don\'t have E, R? Actually, ""SAULT"" is not a common word. How about ""SALAD""? But that has two A\'s and we don\'t know if that\'s good. Also, we want to avoid known absent letters.\n\n  Let\'s think of ""PAINT"": but N is eliminated, so not allowed.\n\n  ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. This avoids forbidden letters.\n\n- A in position 4: words like ""PLANT"" -> but N is eliminated, so not allowed. ""TRACK"" -> R and C are eliminated. ""BLAZE"" -> E is eliminated.\n\n  ""FOCAL"": F, O, C, A, L -> but C is eliminated, so not allowed.\n\n  ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E is eliminated.\n\n  It\'s getting tricky.\n\n- A in position 5: words like ""PIZZA"", but Z is not common. ""AROMA"" -> but A is repeated and we have R which is eliminated. ""OUTLA"" not a word.\n\n  ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated and A repeated.\n\nGiven the constraints, let\'s try to form a word without the forbidden letters and with A in a position other than 3.\n\nWe can try A in position 1: \n  Without E, R, C, N: \n    Words: AUDIO, AUDIT, AVOID, ATOLL, ATOMS, etc.\n\nAUDIO: A, U, D, I, O -> all new letters and no duplicates. This is a good candidate because it covers 5 new vowels and consonants.\n\nWe can try A in position 2:\n  Words: SALAD (but duplicate A and we don\'t know if duplicate is good, and D is new), \n          PAGAN (but G and N, N is eliminated), \n          MAJOR (but R is eliminated), \n          TABBY (duplicate B? and Y is new), \n          HABIT (H, A, B, I, T) -> no forbidden letters.\n\nHABIT: H, A, B, I, T -> A in position 2, and we get to test H, B, I, T.\n\nSimilarly, we can consider A in position 4: \n  Words: OPTAL (not common), \n          FOCAL (has C, eliminated), \n          LEGAL (has E, eliminated), \n          ROTAL (has R, eliminated), \n          VITAL (V, I, T, A, L) -> no forbidden letters? V, I, T, A, L. So A in position 4.\n\nVITAL: V, I, T, A, L -> covers V, I, T, L and A in position 4.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the secret word has A in position 1,2,4, or 5. We want to test A in a position that we haven\'t tried and that is likely.\n\nSince we have no information about other positions, we can choose a word that tests A in a new position and also tests many common letters.\n\nConsidering the above, two strong candidates are:\n1. AUDIO: tests A in position 1 and U, D, I, O.\n2. HABIT: tests A in position 2 and H, B, I, T.\n\nWe can also consider:\n3. VITAL: tests A in position 4 and V, I, T, L.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more common letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PASTA"" -> but P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A and we don\'t know if that\'s efficient. Also, A is in position 2 and 5. But we know A is present at least once, so if we get two A\'s in the feedback, we know there are two. But it might be better to avoid duplicates to test more letters.\n\nTherefore, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it uses 5 new letters and places A in a new position (position 1). Also, it covers multiple vowels (A, I, O, U) and one consonant (D), which might help us narrow down the vowels in the word.\n\nAlternatively, ""HABIT"" tests more consonants (H, B, T) and one vowel (I) and A.\n\nBut since we know A is in the word, and we don\'t know about vowels, testing multiple vowels might be good.\n\nHowever, note that the feedback for ""crane"" showed that E is absent, so the secret word might have other vowels: A (we know), and possibly I, O, U.\n\nSo ""AUDIO"" tests A, U, D, I, O.\n\nBut D is a consonant. This word has 4 vowels and one consonant.\n\nAnother option: ""ADIEU"" is a common starter, but it has E and we know E is absent, so we cannot use it.\n\nSo, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if ""AUDIO"" is a valid word: yes, it is.\n\nSo, I will go with ""AUDIO"".\n\nBut note: we must avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""AUDIO"" does not contain any of these.\n\nTherefore, our next guess: AUDIO.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **A** is present but not in position 3 (misplaced).\n- **C, R, N, E** are absent (not in the word).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** (since it\'s confirmed present) but **not in position 3**.\n- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters and positions to maximize information.\n\nThe word **AUDIO** is chosen because:\n- It includes **A** in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- It introduces 4 new common letters (**U, D, I, O**), covering vowels and consonants.\n- It avoids forbidden letters and repeats, helping identify additional correct/absent letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>audio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\n1.

So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\n- The following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nWe now know the secret word contains A (at least one occurrence) and does not contain any of: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nWe have to make a new 5-letter word guess that:\n- Includes the letter A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since it can\'t be in 1 or 3).\n- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nWe also want to test as many new common letters as possible to get more information.\n\nAvailable letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven\'t tested yet:\nVowels: We have tested A, E, I, O, U. The only vowel left is possibly Y? But note: A is already in the word, and we know E, I, O, U are absent. So the only vowel we have is A and possibly Y.\n\nConsonants: We have tested C, R, N, D. So we have many left: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: Y can be a vowel or consonant, but in this case, since we are missing vowels, we should consider Y as a vowel possibility.\n\nSo the word must have A and possibly Y as the only vowel? Because E, I, O, U are out.\n\nTherefore, the secret word likely has A and maybe Y, and the rest are consonants from the available set.\n\nWe should try to cover as many common consonants as possible and also test the position of A.\n\nPossible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A in one of these positions and use only the available letters.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.\n\nWe can try:\n\n- A in position 2: \n  - Words: _ A _ _ _\n  - Examples: ""BASTY"" (but is that a word? not really), ""PASTY"" (a word, meaning like a pastry), ""HASTY"", ""NASTY"" (but N is out), ""MASTY"" (not common). \n  - Since N is out, we can try ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> but we haven\'t tested H, S, T, Y. And A in position 2.\n\n- A in position 4:\n  - Words: _ _ _ A _\n  - Examples: ""PLANT"" (N out), ""SLANT"" (N out), ""BLAST"" (but we have A in position 4? B, L, A, S, T -> A is in position 3? Wait, let\'s index: position 1: B, 2: L, 3: A, 4: S, 5: T -> but we know A cannot be in position 3. So we need A in position 4. \n  - How about ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P -> A is in position 3? No, that\'s position 3 again. We need position 4: so the fourth letter is A. \n  - Example: ""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but I is out. \n  - ""FOCAL"" -> O and C out. \n  - ""LYCRA"" -> L, Y, C, R, A -> C and R out. \n  - It\'s tricky. How about ""BYLAW"": B, Y, L, A, W -> A in position 4. This uses B, Y, L, W. And avoids forbidden letters.\n\n- A in position 5:\n  - Words: _ _ _ _ A\n  - Examples: ""PIZZA"" (Z is not common, and we have I out), ""TABLA"" (T, A, B, L, A -> duplicate A? and A in position 2 and 5, but we don\'t know if duplicate is allowed). \n  - ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N out. \n  - ""ALGAE"" -> E out and A in position 1 which we know is not allowed? Actually, in ""ALGAE"", A is in position 1 and 5? But we know A cannot be in position 1. \n  - We need a word with A only at the end. \n  - Example: ""ULTRA"" -> U and R out. \n  - ""EXTRA"" -> E and R out. \n  - ""OCTAL"" -> O and C out. \n  - ""FATWA"": F, A, T, W, A -> A in position 2 and 5? But we can have A at the end. However, we are testing A in position 5. But note: we also have A in position 2, which we know is a possible position? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. \n  - Alternatively, ""SALSA"": S, A, L, S, A -> A in position 2 and 5, and duplicate S. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. \n\nGiven the constraints, let\'s list some candidate words that are valid and avoid the forbidden letters and have A in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nCandidate 1: ""HASTY"" \n  - H, A, S, T, Y\n  - A in position 2\n  - Tests H, S, T, Y (all new) and A (which we know is present, but we are testing position 2)\n\nCandidate 2: ""PASTY""\n  - P, A, S, T, Y\n  - A in position 2\n  - Tests P, S, T, Y\n\nCandidate 3: ""BYLAW""\n  - B, Y, L, A, W\n  - A in position 4\n  - Tests B, Y, L, W\n\nCandidate 4: ""GAMMA"" \n  - G, A, M, M, A -> but duplicate M and duplicate A? And A is in position 2 and 5. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are testing A in position 2 and 5? But we know A is present, so if we get two A\'s in feedback, we know there are two. However, it uses duplicate M which might not be efficient for information.\n\nBut note: we only have 4 guesses left (since we used 2, and we have 6 total). We want to maximize information.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SASSY"" -> but duplicate S and Y, and A is not present? We must include A.\n\nWe must include A.\n\nAnother idea: ""TAFFY"" -> T, A, F, F, Y -> A in position 2, and duplicate F. But we test T, F, Y.\n\nBut duplicate letters might not be ideal because we get less information.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid duplicates if possible.\n\nTherefore, ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY"" are good because they have no duplicates and test 4 new letters.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHALT"" -> S, H, A, L, T -> A in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So invalid.\n\n""PLATY"" -> P, L, A, T, Y -> A in position 3? Again, position 3 is invalid.\n\nSo for position 2: ""HASTY"", ""PASTY"", ""BAWDY"" (B, A, W, D, Y -> but D is out? D is absent, so we cannot use D). D is absent from the feedback of ""audio"".\n\nIn ""audio"", D was marked absent, so we cannot use D.\n\nSimilarly, in ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> all are new and not forbidden? \nForbidden: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. So H, S, T, Y are allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> same.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if Y is allowed. We haven\'t tested it, so it\'s okay.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MAWKY"" (meaning sullen) -> M, A, W, K, Y -> A in position 2. Tests M, W, K, Y.\n\nBut ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY"" are more common.\n\nWe can also consider A in position 5: \n  ""PHYLA"" -> P, H, Y, L, A -> A in position 5. Tests P, H, Y, L.\n\nBut ""PHYLA"" is a word (plural of phylum).\n\nHowever, we don\'t know if the word has Y. We need to test it.\n\nBut note: we have very few vowels left. Since E, I, O, U are absent, the only vowels can be A and Y (if Y is used as a vowel). So it\'s important to test Y.\n\nIn fact, the secret word might have Y.\n\nSo both ""HASTY"" and ""PHYLA"" are good.\n\nBut ""HASTY"" has A in position 2, which is one of the possible positions, and tests S and T which are very common.\n\nSimilarly, ""PHYLA"" tests P, H, Y, L and A in position 5.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common consonants. S and T are very common.\n\nSo ""HASTY"" or ""PASTY"" are good.\n\nBut note: we also want to test the position of A. If we put A in position 2, and if it turns out to be correct, we know A is in position 2. If not, then A must be in 4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, if we put A in position 5 and it\'s correct, we know. But if we put it in position 2 and it\'s wrong, we still have positions 4 and 5.\n\nBut we have to cover as many letters as possible.\n\nI think ""HASTY"" is a good choice because:\n- It tests A in position 2 (if it\'s correct, we get a check, if not, we know it\'s misplaced and then we know it must be in 4 or 5).\n- It tests H, S, T, Y, which are common.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""HASTY"".\n\nBut wait, is ""HASTY"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nTherefore, our next guess: HASTY.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **A** is confirmed present but not in positions 1 or 3 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).\n- **C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O** are confirmed absent and cannot be used.\n- The secret word likely contains **A** and possibly **Y** (as the only untested vowel), with consonants from the remaining pool (B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** in position 2, 4, or 5 to test its location.\n- Prioritize testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, H) and the vowel Y.\n- Avoid duplicate letters to maximize information gain.\n\n**Why ""HASTY""?**\n- Places **A in position 2** (testing one of the valid positions).\n- Introduces **H, S, T, Y** (all untested letters; S and T are high-frequency consonants, Y is a key vowel candidate).\n- Avoids forbidden letters and repeats, ensuring efficient feedback.\n- If **A** is correct in position 2, we get immediate confirmation. If not, we narrow its position to 4 or 5 while checking four new letters.\n\n<guess>hasty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: hasty -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) S(x) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\n1.

So the word pattern is: _ A _ T Y\n- The first and third letters are unknown, but we know:\n  - The first letter cannot be H, and the third letter cannot be S (since S is absent).\n- Additionally, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.\n\nWe also know that A is in the word, but we already have it in position 2, and T and Y are also in the word and correctly placed.\n\nNow, we need to find a word that fits the pattern _ A _ T Y.\n\nThe missing letters are the first and third positions.\n\nWe must avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s list possible letters for the first and third positions.\n\nAvailable letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven\'t tested or that are not absent:\nWe have tested: A, C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, T, Y.\n\nBut note: T and Y are in the word and placed, so they are present. But we are only missing two letters.\n\nThe absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.\n\nSo available letters: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nWe also have A, T, Y, but they are already placed, so we don\'t need to use them again unless the word has duplicates? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven\'t seen any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now. Since A, T, Y are already in the word, we cannot use them again in the first or third position.\n\nTherefore, the first and third positions must be filled with two distinct letters from: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nNow, we need to form a word: [letter1] A [letter3] T Y\n\nWe can try to think of common words that end with ""ATY"" but note the pattern is _ A _ T Y, so the last three are A, then a letter, then T, Y? No: the word is: position 1: ?, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: T, 5: Y.\n\nSo the word has the form: ?A?TY\n\nCommon words that end with ""TY"" are often like ""party"", ""dirty"", but we have ""A"" in the second position.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have the pattern: _ A _ T Y\n\nExamples:\n- PARTY: P, A, R, T, Y -> but R is absent (from guess1: R(x)), so not allowed.\n- DARTY: D is absent (from guess2: D(x)), and R absent.\n- BATTY: B, A, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And in position 3 we have T? Let\'s see: B (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), Y (5). But we need position 4 to be T, which it is, but position 3 is T. However, we have two T\'s? But the feedback for ""hasty"" had T in position 4 and 5? No, in ""hasty"": H, A, S, T, Y -> position 4 is T and position 5 is Y. So in the secret word, position 4 is T and 5 is Y. In ""BATTY"", we have T in position 3 and 4? That would be: position 3: T, position 4: T? But we need position 4 to be T, which is fine, but position 3 is T. However, we don\'t know if T can be in position 3. Also, we have two T\'s? But the feedback for ""hasty"" only showed one T (in position 4) and one Y (in position 5). If the secret word has two T\'s, then when we guessed ""hasty"", which has one T in position 4, we would have gotten a check for that T, but if there is another T in position 3, it would have been marked as absent or misplaced? In ""hasty"", we have S in position 3, which was absent. If the secret word had a T in position 3, then when we guessed ""hasty"", the T in position 4 would be correct (which it was), but the T in position 3 of the secret word would not be reflected because we didn\'t guess a T in position 3. We guessed S in position 3, which is absent, so no issue. So it is possible for the secret word to have a T in position 3? But we don\'t have any information about position 3 except that it cannot be S (from ""hasty"" feedback: S(x)) and cannot be the absent letters.\n\nBut in ""BATTY"", we have T in position 3. However, we also have T in position 4. The word ""BATTY"" is valid. But we must check if the letters are allowed: B is available, A is already in position 2, T in position 3 and 4? But we are going to put T in position 3? But we know position 4 is T, so if we put T in position 3, that\'s a duplicate. But is duplicate allowed? We don\'t know. The rules don\'t prohibit duplicates. However, in the feedback for ""hasty"", we only got one T marked as correct (position 4), but that doesn\'t tell us if there is another T. Similarly, we got Y correct in position 5, but no information about other Y\'s.\n\nBut in this case, for ""BATTY"", the pattern would be: B (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), Y (5). So position 3 is T and position 4 is T. Now, when we guessed ""hasty"", which has S in position 3 (absent) and T in position 4 (correct). The secret word\'s T in position 3 was not guessed, so it didn\'t show up. That\'s fine. But we don\'t know if the word has two T\'s.\n\nHowever, we are trying to guess the word, so we can consider ""BATTY"" as a candidate.\n\nBut we must avoid absent letters. B is available, T is already in the word (but we are using it again, which is allowed if duplicates are allowed). Y is also in the word.\n\nBut let\'s see the available letters for the missing positions: we need a letter for position 1 and position 3.\n\nIn ""BATTY"", position 1 is B, position 3 is T.\n\nBut T is already in position 4. Is that allowed? Yes, if the word has two T\'s.\n\nBut we don\'t have any evidence against duplicates.\n\nOther candidates:\n\n- PATTY: P, A, T, T, Y -> similar to BATTY, but position 3 is T and position 4 is T? Pattern: P(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5). But we need position 4 to be T, which it is. But again, duplicate T.\n\n- MARTY: M, A, R, T, Y -> but R is absent.\n\n- CATTY: C is absent.\n\n- FATTY: F, A, T, T, Y -> F is available? F is not in the absent list. So FATTY is a candidate.\n\nBut again, duplicate T.\n\n- WARTY: W, A, R, T, Y -> R absent.\n\n- PARTY: R absent.\n\n- DATTY: D absent.\n\n- GATTY: G, A, T, T, Y -> G available.\n\nBut all these have duplicate T.\n\nAre there words without duplicate T?\n\nFor example, words with different letters:\n\n- BALTY? Not a word.\n\n- PALTY? Not a word.\n\n- MALTY: M, A, L, T, Y -> M(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5). This has no duplicate. And L is available.\n\nSimilarly, ""SALTY"": but S is absent.\n\n""KATTY"" -> duplicate T? K, A, T, T, Y -> duplicate.\n\n""VATTY"" -> not common.\n\n""JAZZY"" -> J, A, Z, Z, Y -> but we need T in position 4? No, position 4 must be T.\n\nThe word must have T in position 4 and Y in position 5.\n\nSo the third letter can be something else.\n\nAnother word: ""TAWNY"" -> T, A, W, N, Y -> but T is in position 1? We need position 1 to be unknown, but in ""TAWNY"", position 1 is T, but we don\'t know if T can be in position 1? Also, we have A in position 2, which is correct, but position 3 is W, position 4 is N? But N is absent. And we need position 4 to be T, but it\'s N. So not.\n\n""TASTY"" -> T, A, S, T, Y -> but S is absent, and T in position 1 and 4? Duplicate T, and S absent.\n\nBack to ""MALTY"": M, A, L, T, Y -> this seems valid. M is available, L is available, T and Y are placed.\n\nSimilarly, ""PALTY"" is not a word, but ""PALSY"" is a word but ends with SY, not TY.\n\n""WALTZ"" -> ends with Z, not TY.\n\n""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> but we need position 4 to be T, but it\'s M. So not.\n\nWe need position 4 to be T, so the word must end with ""TY"", but with a letter in between? The pattern is ?A?TY, so the last three letters are ? T Y, but the ? is the third letter.\n\nSo the word is: [1]A[3]TY\n\nSo the third letter is before T.\n\nWords: \n- MALTY: M A L T Y -> valid, meaning like malt.\n- SALTY: but S absent.\n- HALTY: not a word.\n- CALTY: not a word.\n- GALTY: not a word.\n- PALTY: not a word.\n- VALTY: not a word.\n- WALTY: not a word.\n\nAnother one: ""DAFTY"" -> D absent.\n\n""RAFTY"" -> R absent.\n\n""HAFTY"" -> H absent.\n\n""TAFTY"" -> T in position 1? Then A in 2, F in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. But duplicate T? And T in position 1 and 4. But we don\'t know if T can be in position 1. Also, F is available. But let\'s see: T(1), A(2), F(3), T(4), Y(5). This is ""TAFTY"" – is that a word? Not really, I think.\n\n""KAPUT"" -> doesn\'t end with TY.\n\nPerhaps ""BATTY"", ""FATTY"", ""PATTY"", ""MARTY"" (but R absent), ""CATTY"" (C absent), ""NATTY"" (N absent), ""RATTY"" (R absent), ""TATTY"" (T in position 1 and 4? duplicate).\n\nBut ""MALTY"" seems a valid option.\n\nAnother word: ""PANTY"" -> P, A, N, T, Y -> but N is absent.\n\n""WANTY"" -> not common, and N? W, A, N, T, Y -> N absent.\n\n""JANTY"" -> J, A, N, T, Y -> N absent.\n\n""FASTY"" -> F, A, S, T, Y -> S absent.\n\nSo, with the available letters, ""MALTY"" is a candidate: M, A, L, T, Y.\n\nWe also have ""GALTY"" not a word, but ""GATTY"" is not standard.\n\n""BALKY"" -> B, A, L, K, Y -> but we need position 4 to be T, but it\'s K. So not.\n\n""PALMY"" -> P, A, L, M, Y -> position 4 is M, not T.\n\nSo, ""MALTY"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut is there another word? What about ""BALMY""? No, because position 4 is M.\n\n""TALKY"" -> T, A, L, K, Y -> position 1 is T, position 4 is K, not T.\n\nWe need position 4 to be T.\n\nAnother possibility: ""WASPY"" -> but S absent, and no T.\n\nPerhaps we missed a word. Let\'s think of ""PARTY"" but R absent.\n\nMaybe ""BAWTY""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""MAWKY"" -> M, A, W, K, Y -> no T in position 4.\n\nI think ""MALTY"" is one of the few options.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: ""malty"" is an adjective relating to malt, so it\'s valid.\n\nAnother word: ""PALTRY"" is 6 letters, too long.\n\nSo, we\'ll go with ""MALTY"".\n\nBut note: in ""MALTY"", the third letter is L. We don\'t have any information about L, so it might be present.\n\nAlso, we are testing M in position 1 and L in position 3.\n\nIf this is not the word, we get feedback on M and L.\n\nBut we have only 3 guesses left (since we used 3, and 6 total), so we can try.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests more common letters, but we only have two positions to fill.\n\nAnother candidate: ""FAVTY"" not a word.\n\n""JAVTY"" no.\n\nPerhaps ""BATTY"" with duplicate T.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we got: in ""hasty"", we had T in position 4 correct, but if the secret word has T in position 3, we wouldn\'t know. But we have no evidence for or against duplicate T.\n\nBut to be safe, we can try ""MALTY"" first.\n\nIf we are wrong, we get feedback on M and L.\n\nBut there is another word: ""WALTZ"" is 5 letters but ends with Z, not Y.\n\nI think ""MALTY"" is acceptable.\n\nSo, our guess: MALTY.\n\nBut let\'s double-check the pattern: M (1), A (2), L (3), T (4), Y (5). Matches _ A _ T Y.\n\nAnd letters: M, L are not in the absent list.\n\nSo, we\'ll go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is misplaced (not in position 3), and C, R, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (audio)**: A is misplaced (not in position 1), and U, D, I, O are absent.\n- **Guess 3 (hasty)**: \n  - A is correct in position 2 (so the second letter is **A**).\n  - T is correct in position 4 (so the fourth letter is **T**).\n  - Y is correct in position 5 (so the fifth letter is **Y**).\n  - H and S are absent.\n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word pattern is: **? A ? T Y** (positions: 1=unknown, 2=A, 3=unknown, 4=T, 5=Y).\n- **Absent letters** (cannot be used): C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.\n- **Available letters** for positions 1 and 3: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since A, T, Y are already placed and duplicates are possible but unconfirmed).\n- The word must include **A**, **T**, and **Y** in their fixed positions, with no other vowels possible (E, I, O, U are absent; Y is the only other vowel candidate and is already placed).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with available letters to form a valid English word.\n- Prioritize common consonants (e.g., L, M, P) to test likely candidates.\n- **Top candidate word**: **MALTY** (M in position 1, L in position 3).

We are given feedback for four guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
   - This told us that A is in the word but not in position 3, and C, R, N, E are absent.

2. ""audio"": A(-), U(x), D(x), I(x), O(x)
   - This told us that A is in the word but not in position 1, and U, D, I, O are absent.

3. ""hasty"": H(x), A(✓), S(x), T(✓), Y(✓)
   - This told us that A is correct in position 2, T is correct in position 4, Y is correct in position 5, and H, S are absent.

4. ""malty"": M(x), A(✓), L(x), T(✓), Y(✓)
   - This tells us: A (position 2) is correct, T (position 4) is correct, Y (position 5) is correct, and M and L are absent.

From this, we know the secret word has the fixed pattern: _ A _ T Y (positions: 1,2,3,4,5 as unknown, A, unknown, T, Y).

We also know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, M, L. Therefore, the absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, M, L.

The available letters for positions 1 and 3 are from the remaining alphabet: B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Note that the word must be a valid English word ending with ""A?TY"" but specifically the pattern is ?A?TY.

We need to form a word with:
- Position 1: one of B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: one of B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (different from position 1, unless duplicates are allowed, but we haven't encountered duplicates yet so we'll avoid for now)
- Positions 4 and 5: T and Y (fixed)

Now, we need to think of words that fit ?A?TY.

Possible words:
- ""PARTY"": But R and P? R is absent, and also we have S in ""party"" but S is absent? Wait, ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y. R is absent (from guess1), and also S not in it, but R is absent so invalid.

- ""BATTY"": B, A, T, T, Y? But position 3 must be T? Pattern: position 1: B, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: T, 5: Y. So if we put T in position 3, then we have: B, A, T, T, Y. This duplicates T, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, T is already confirmed in position 4. For position 3, we could have T? Then it's ""BATTY"".

Similarly, ""PATTY"", ""FATTY"", ""CATTY"" (C absent), ""NATTY"" (N absent), ""RATTY"" (R absent), ""WATTY"", ""KATTY"", ""JATTY"", etc.

But ""CATTY"" has C absent, ""NATTY"" has N absent, ""RATTY"" has R absent, so discard.

But ""PATTY"": P, A, T, T, Y -> duplicate T? And position 3 is T.

""FATTY"": F, A, T, T, Y.

But are there any words without duplicate T? For example, ""DAVTY"" is not a word. Let's look for other words.

Another word: ""KAPUT"" but doesn't end with TY.

""GAWKY"" -> G, A, W, K, Y -> but position 4 must be T, it's K. So no.

""JAWED"" -> not ending in TY.

Given our available letters, the only common words seem to be ones with duplicate T, like ""BATTY"", ""PATTY"", ""FATTY"". 

We also have ""PASTY"" but S is absent and doesn't fit pattern.

Or ""HASTY"" but H and S absent and we already guessed it.

Another possibility: ""TAWNY"" -> T, A, W, N, Y -> N absent and position 4 is N, not T.

""TAFFY"" -> T, A, F, F, Y -> duplicate F? And position 4 is F, not T.

We need position 4 to be T.

So, given the constraints, the best candidates are words like ""BATTY"", ""PATTY"", ""FATTY"", etc.

Now, note: in our guess ""hasty"", we had T in position 4, and the feedback was correct, but that doesn't tell us if there is another T. Similarly, in ""malty"", we had T in position 4 and it was correct.

But if the secret word has duplicate T, then we wouldn't have seen it because we haven't guessed T in another position.

Therefore, duplicates are possible.

Moreover, since we have limited options, we should try ""BATTY"" or another.

Let's list candidate words:
- BATTY: B, A, T, T, Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y -> this has T in position 3 and 4. But we need position 4 to be T (which it is), and position 3 is T. We need to check if B, A, T, T, Y form a word: yes, ""batty"" is valid.

Similarly:
- PATTY: P, A, T, T, Y -> same pattern? P(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5) -> note: in this case, position 3 is T, position 4 is T, but in the pattern we need position 3 to be an unknown, but we can put T there? Yes.

But note: in our fixed positions, position 4 is T, so if we put a word with T in position 3, that's acceptable as long as the letters are available.

Similarly, FATTY: F, A, T, T, Y.

WATTY: W, A, T, T, Y -> is this a word? Not common, but ""watty"" might be a surname or rare, but we can consider.

KATTY: similarly.

But ""batty"", ""fatty"", ""patty"" are common.

Also, ""CATTY"" was invalid.

Now, we also have other words? What about ""GABBY""? Ends with BY.

Or ""JABOT""? Not ending with TY.

So, we'll choose ""BATTY"" as our next guess.

But note: in ""BATTY"", we are using T in position 3. We haven't tested T in any position other than position 4. Also, B is available.

Similarly, we can choose ""PATTY"".

Let's pick ""BATTY"".

If we are correct, we win. If not, the feedback might show:

- If position 1 is B and correct? Or not? And position 3 is T, which might be correct or absent.

But since the pattern is fixed except positions 1 and 3, and we are testing B and T.

Alternatively, we can try ""PAWTY""? Not a word.

I think ""BATTY"" is a good try.

So, we'll guess ""BATTY"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is misplaced (not in position 3); C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (audio)**: A is misplaced (not in position 1); U, D, I, O are absent.
- **Guess 3 (hasty)**: 
  - A, T, Y are correct in positions 2, 4, and 5 (→ word pattern: `? A ? T Y`).
  - H and S are absent.
- **Guess 4 (malty)**:
  - A (position 2), T (position 4), Y (position 5) are confirmed correct again.
  - M and L are absent.

### Deductions:
- **Fixed pattern**: The secret word is `? A ? T Y` (positions: 1=unknown, 2=A, 3=unknown, 4=T, 5=Y).
- **Absent letters (excluded)**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, M, L (all letters tested so far except A, T, Y).
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 3**: B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since duplicates are possible but unconfirmed).
- **Key constraints**: The word must be a valid English word ending in `...ATY`, with positions 1 and 3 filled from the available letters.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Pattern requirement**: The word must fit `? A ? T Y`, prioritizing common letters from the available pool (e.g., B, P, F, K).
- **Top candidate**: **BATTY** (B in position 1, T in position 3). This word:
  - Fits the pattern as `B A T T Y`.
  - Uses available letters (B not absent; T is already placed but duplicates are allowed).
  - Tests B (common consonant) and confirms if position 3 is T.
  - Is a valid English word (meaning ""eccentric or crazy"").
- **Why not other options?**  
  - `?` positions can't reuse absent letters (e.g., S in ""tasty"" or R in ""party"").  
  - Words like ""FATTY"" or ""PATTY"" are viable backups, but ""BATTY"" tests a new letter (B) efficiently.  
- **Risk**: If incorrect, feedback on B and T (position 3) will narrow options further (e.g., if B is absent, try ""PATTY""; if T is absent, test other consonants like K or F).

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since this is the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback. 
 We need to choose a 5-letter English word. It's good to pick a word that covers common letters to get maximum information.

 Common vowels and consonants are a good start. Words with a lot of vowels might not cover as many consonants. 
 Alternatively, words with common consonants and vowels can be helpful.

 Some common starting words in Wordle are:
 - CRANE, SLATE, CRATE, STARE, ADIEU, etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 1 vowel (A, E). 
 But note: the feedback format uses ✓, -, and x. We want to maximize the information we get.

 However, note the example: ""STORM"" for secret word ""BRISK"" gave feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x).

 The word ""CRANE"":
  - C: common consonant
  - R: common consonant
  - A: common vowel
  - N: common consonant
  - E: common vowel

 This word covers 4 distinct consonants and 2 vowels (with E at the end). It's a balanced word.

 Another common strategy is to pick words without repeated letters. ""CRANE"" has no repeated letters.

 So let's go with ""CRANE"".After analyzing the game rules and considering common strategies for initial guesses in word games, I chose a word that includes frequent vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. ""CRANE"" is effective because it contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), helping identify letter presence/absence quickly.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, and it is not in the third position. Also, we must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.

We need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E.
- Includes the letter A, but not in the third position.

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have the letter A and avoid the forbidden letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

One common strategy is to try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common consonants.

Possible positions for A: since it can't be in position 3, we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's list some candidate words:

- A in position 1: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""APART"", ""APPLE"", etc.
  But note: we cannot use E (from ABOUT, ABOVE, AFTER, APART) because E is eliminated. Also, we cannot use R (in ABOUT, AFTER, APART) because R is eliminated.

  So, we need words without E and R.

  For example: 
    ""ALONG"": A, L, O, N, G -> but N is eliminated, so not allowed.
    ""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E -> E is eliminated and also repeated P? But the word is valid, but we cannot use E. So not allowed.

  Let's try ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> all new letters? But we don't know if they are in the word. This word has A in position 1 and avoids the forbidden letters.

- A in position 2: words like ""PASTA"", but S and T are new, but we have A in position 2 and then T in position 3? But we cannot use E, R, etc. Also, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5? But we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don't say the secret word has distinct letters, so duplicates are possible. However, in our feedback for ""crane"", we only have one A and it was marked as present, so if there were two A's, we might have gotten two marks? But the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we have only one A in ""crane"", we only know that at least one A is present. The secret word might have more than one A.

  But for now, let's avoid duplicates to maximize information.

  ""SAULT"": but U, L, T? But we don't have E, R? Actually, ""SAULT"" is not a common word. How about ""SALAD""? But that has two A's and we don't know if that's good. Also, we want to avoid known absent letters.

  Let's think of ""PAINT"": but N is eliminated, so not allowed.

  ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. This avoids forbidden letters.

- A in position 4: words like ""PLANT"" -> but N is eliminated, so not allowed. ""TRACK"" -> R and C are eliminated. ""BLAZE"" -> E is eliminated.

  ""FOCAL"": F, O, C, A, L -> but C is eliminated, so not allowed.

  ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E is eliminated.

  It's getting tricky.

- A in position 5: words like ""PIZZA"", but Z is not common. ""AROMA"" -> but A is repeated and we have R which is eliminated. ""OUTLA"" not a word.

  ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated and A repeated.

Given the constraints, let's try to form a word without the forbidden letters and with A in a position other than 3.

We can try A in position 1: 
  Without E, R, C, N: 
    Words: AUDIO, AUDIT, AVOID, ATOLL, ATOMS, etc.

AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O -> all new letters and no duplicates. This is a good candidate because it covers 5 new vowels and consonants.

We can try A in position 2:
  Words: SALAD (but duplicate A and we don't know if duplicate is good, and D is new), 
          PAGAN (but G and N, N is eliminated), 
          MAJOR (but R is eliminated), 
          TABBY (duplicate B? and Y is new), 
          HABIT (H, A, B, I, T) -> no forbidden letters.

HABIT: H, A, B, I, T -> A in position 2, and we get to test H, B, I, T.

Similarly, we can consider A in position 4: 
  Words: OPTAL (not common), 
          FOCAL (has C, eliminated), 
          LEGAL (has E, eliminated), 
          ROTAL (has R, eliminated), 
          VITAL (V, I, T, A, L) -> no forbidden letters? V, I, T, A, L. So A in position 4.

VITAL: V, I, T, A, L -> covers V, I, T, L and A in position 4.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has A in position 1,2,4, or 5. We want to test A in a position that we haven't tried and that is likely.

Since we have no information about other positions, we can choose a word that tests A in a new position and also tests many common letters.

Considering the above, two strong candidates are:
1. AUDIO: tests A in position 1 and U, D, I, O.
2. HABIT: tests A in position 2 and H, B, I, T.

We can also consider:
3. VITAL: tests A in position 4 and V, I, T, L.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more common letters.

Another candidate: ""PASTA"" -> but P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A and we don't know if that's efficient. Also, A is in position 2 and 5. But we know A is present at least once, so if we get two A's in the feedback, we know there are two. But it might be better to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Therefore, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it uses 5 new letters and places A in a new position (position 1). Also, it covers multiple vowels (A, I, O, U) and one consonant (D), which might help us narrow down the vowels in the word.

Alternatively, ""HABIT"" tests more consonants (H, B, T) and one vowel (I) and A.

But since we know A is in the word, and we don't know about vowels, testing multiple vowels might be good.

However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" showed that E is absent, so the secret word might have other vowels: A (we know), and possibly I, O, U.

So ""AUDIO"" tests A, U, D, I, O.

But D is a consonant. This word has 4 vowels and one consonant.

Another option: ""ADIEU"" is a common starter, but it has E and we know E is absent, so we cannot use it.

So, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice.

But let me check if ""AUDIO"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

So, I will go with ""AUDIO"".

But note: we must avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""AUDIO"" does not contain any of these.

Therefore, our next guess: AUDIO.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (misplaced).
- **C, R, N, E** are absent (not in the word).

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed present) but **not in position 3**.
- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters and positions to maximize information.

The word **AUDIO** is chosen because:
- It includes **A** in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It introduces 4 new common letters (**U, D, I, O**), covering vowels and consonants.
- It avoids forbidden letters and repeats, helping identify additional correct/absent letters efficiently.

<guess>audio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - This means:
        C: absent (not in the word)
        R: absent
        A: present but not in the 3rd position (since in ""crane"" it was in position 3)
        N: absent
        E: absent

2. ""audio"" -> A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
   - This means:
        A: present but not in the 1st position (since in ""audio"" it was in position 1)
        U: absent
        D: absent
        I: absent
        O: absent

From both feedbacks, we can deduce:

- The letter A is in the word, but not in position 1 (from ""audio"") and not in position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

- The following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We now know the secret word contains A (at least one occurrence) and does not contain any of: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We have to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Includes the letter A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 1 or 3).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We also want to test as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tested yet:
Vowels: We have tested A, E, I, O, U. The only vowel left is possibly Y? But note: A is already in the word, and we know E, I, O, U are absent. So the only vowel we have is A and possibly Y.

Consonants: We have tested C, R, N, D. So we have many left: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: Y can be a vowel or consonant, but in this case, since we are missing vowels, we should consider Y as a vowel possibility.

So the word must have A and possibly Y as the only vowel? Because E, I, O, U are out.

Therefore, the secret word likely has A and maybe Y, and the rest are consonants from the available set.

We should try to cover as many common consonants as possible and also test the position of A.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.

Let's think of words that have A in one of these positions and use only the available letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

We can try:

- A in position 2: 
  - Words: _ A _ _ _
  - Examples: ""BASTY"" (but is that a word? not really), ""PASTY"" (a word, meaning like a pastry), ""HASTY"", ""NASTY"" (but N is out), ""MASTY"" (not common). 
  - Since N is out, we can try ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> but we haven't tested H, S, T, Y. And A in position 2.

- A in position 4:
  - Words: _ _ _ A _
  - Examples: ""PLANT"" (N out), ""SLANT"" (N out), ""BLAST"" (but we have A in position 4? B, L, A, S, T -> A is in position 3? Wait, let's index: position 1: B, 2: L, 3: A, 4: S, 5: T -> but we know A cannot be in position 3. So we need A in position 4. 
  - How about ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P -> A is in position 3? No, that's position 3 again. We need position 4: so the fourth letter is A. 
  - Example: ""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but I is out. 
  - ""FOCAL"" -> O and C out. 
  - ""LYCRA"" -> L, Y, C, R, A -> C and R out. 
  - It's tricky. How about ""BYLAW"": B, Y, L, A, W -> A in position 4. This uses B, Y, L, W. And avoids forbidden letters.

- A in position 5:
  - Words: _ _ _ _ A
  - Examples: ""PIZZA"" (Z is not common, and we have I out), ""TABLA"" (T, A, B, L, A -> duplicate A? and A in position 2 and 5, but we don't know if duplicate is allowed). 
  - ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N out. 
  - ""ALGAE"" -> E out and A in position 1 which we know is not allowed? Actually, in ""ALGAE"", A is in position 1 and 5? But we know A cannot be in position 1. 
  - We need a word with A only at the end. 
  - Example: ""ULTRA"" -> U and R out. 
  - ""EXTRA"" -> E and R out. 
  - ""OCTAL"" -> O and C out. 
  - ""FATWA"": F, A, T, W, A -> A in position 2 and 5? But we can have A at the end. However, we are testing A in position 5. But note: we also have A in position 2, which we know is a possible position? But we don't know if the word has two A's. 
  - Alternatively, ""SALSA"": S, A, L, S, A -> A in position 2 and 5, and duplicate S. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. 

Given the constraints, let's list some candidate words that are valid and avoid the forbidden letters and have A in position 2, 4, or 5.

Candidate 1: ""HASTY"" 
  - H, A, S, T, Y
  - A in position 2
  - Tests H, S, T, Y (all new) and A (which we know is present, but we are testing position 2)

Candidate 2: ""PASTY""
  - P, A, S, T, Y
  - A in position 2
  - Tests P, S, T, Y

Candidate 3: ""BYLAW""
  - B, Y, L, A, W
  - A in position 4
  - Tests B, Y, L, W

Candidate 4: ""GAMMA"" 
  - G, A, M, M, A -> but duplicate M and duplicate A? And A is in position 2 and 5. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are testing A in position 2 and 5? But we know A is present, so if we get two A's in feedback, we know there are two. However, it uses duplicate M which might not be efficient for information.

But note: we only have 4 guesses left (since we used 2, and we have 6 total). We want to maximize information.

Another candidate: ""SASSY"" -> but duplicate S and Y, and A is not present? We must include A.

We must include A.

Another idea: ""TAFFY"" -> T, A, F, F, Y -> A in position 2, and duplicate F. But we test T, F, Y.

But duplicate letters might not be ideal because we get less information.

So, let's avoid duplicates if possible.

Therefore, ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY"" are good because they have no duplicates and test 4 new letters.

We can also consider ""SHALT"" -> S, H, A, L, T -> A in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So invalid.

""PLATY"" -> P, L, A, T, Y -> A in position 3? Again, position 3 is invalid.

So for position 2: ""HASTY"", ""PASTY"", ""BAWDY"" (B, A, W, D, Y -> but D is out? D is absent, so we cannot use D). D is absent from the feedback of ""audio"".

In ""audio"", D was marked absent, so we cannot use D.

Similarly, in ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> all are new and not forbidden? 
Forbidden: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. So H, S, T, Y are allowed.

Similarly, ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> same.

But note: we don't know if Y is allowed. We haven't tested it, so it's okay.

Another candidate: ""MAWKY"" (meaning sullen) -> M, A, W, K, Y -> A in position 2. Tests M, W, K, Y.

But ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY"" are more common.

We can also consider A in position 5: 
  ""PHYLA"" -> P, H, Y, L, A -> A in position 5. Tests P, H, Y, L.

But ""PHYLA"" is a word (plural of phylum).

However, we don't know if the word has Y. We need to test it.

But note: we have very few vowels left. Since E, I, O, U are absent, the only vowels can be A and Y (if Y is used as a vowel). So it's important to test Y.

In fact, the secret word might have Y.

So both ""HASTY"" and ""PHYLA"" are good.

But ""HASTY"" has A in position 2, which is one of the possible positions, and tests S and T which are very common.

Similarly, ""PHYLA"" tests P, H, Y, L and A in position 5.

We have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common consonants. S and T are very common.

So ""HASTY"" or ""PASTY"" are good.

But note: we also want to test the position of A. If we put A in position 2, and if it turns out to be correct, we know A is in position 2. If not, then A must be in 4 or 5.

Similarly, if we put A in position 5 and it's correct, we know. But if we put it in position 2 and it's wrong, we still have positions 4 and 5.

But we have to cover as many letters as possible.

I think ""HASTY"" is a good choice because:
- It tests A in position 2 (if it's correct, we get a check, if not, we know it's misplaced and then we know it must be in 4 or 5).
- It tests H, S, T, Y, which are common.

So let's go with ""HASTY"".

But wait, is ""HASTY"" a valid word? Yes.

Therefore, our next guess: HASTY.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **A** is confirmed present but not in positions 1 or 3 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).
- **C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O** are confirmed absent and cannot be used.
- The secret word likely contains **A** and possibly **Y** (as the only untested vowel), with consonants from the remaining pool (B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** in position 2, 4, or 5 to test its location.
- Prioritize testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, H) and the vowel Y.
- Avoid duplicate letters to maximize information gain.

**Why ""HASTY""?**
- Places **A in position 2** (testing one of the valid positions).
- Introduces **H, S, T, Y** (all untested letters; S and T are high-frequency consonants, Y is a key vowel candidate).
- Avoids forbidden letters and repeats, ensuring efficient feedback.
- If **A** is correct in position 2, we get immediate confirmation. If not, we narrow its position to 4 or 5 while checking four new letters.

<guess>hasty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
Guess 3: hasty -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) S(x) T(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - A is present but not in position 3.

2. ""audio"" -> A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
   - A is present but not in position 1.

3. ""hasty"" -> H(x) A(✓) S(x) T(✓) Y(✓)
   - A is correct in position 2 (so the second letter is A).
   - T is correct in position 4 (so the fourth letter is T).
   - Y is correct in position 5 (so the fifth letter is Y).
   - H and S are absent.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the second letter A, fourth letter T, and fifth letter Y. So the word pattern is: _ A _ T Y
- The first and third letters are unknown, but we know:
  - The first letter cannot be H, and the third letter cannot be S (since S is absent).
- Additionally, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

We also know that A is in the word, but we already have it in position 2, and T and Y are also in the word and correctly placed.

Now, we need to find a word that fits the pattern _ A _ T Y.

The missing letters are the first and third positions.

We must avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's list possible letters for the first and third positions.

Available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tested or that are not absent:
We have tested: A, C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, T, Y.

But note: T and Y are in the word and placed, so they are present. But we are only missing two letters.

The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.

So available letters: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We also have A, T, Y, but they are already placed, so we don't need to use them again unless the word has duplicates? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now. Since A, T, Y are already in the word, we cannot use them again in the first or third position.

Therefore, the first and third positions must be filled with two distinct letters from: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Now, we need to form a word: [letter1] A [letter3] T Y

We can try to think of common words that end with ""ATY"" but note the pattern is _ A _ T Y, so the last three are A, then a letter, then T, Y? No: the word is: position 1: ?, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: T, 5: Y.

So the word has the form: ?A?TY

Common words that end with ""TY"" are often like ""party"", ""dirty"", but we have ""A"" in the second position.

Let's think of words that have the pattern: _ A _ T Y

Examples:
- PARTY: P, A, R, T, Y -> but R is absent (from guess1: R(x)), so not allowed.
- DARTY: D is absent (from guess2: D(x)), and R absent.
- BATTY: B, A, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And in position 3 we have T? Let's see: B (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), Y (5). But we need position 4 to be T, which it is, but position 3 is T. However, we have two T's? But the feedback for ""hasty"" had T in position 4 and 5? No, in ""hasty"": H, A, S, T, Y -> position 4 is T and position 5 is Y. So in the secret word, position 4 is T and 5 is Y. In ""BATTY"", we have T in position 3 and 4? That would be: position 3: T, position 4: T? But we need position 4 to be T, which is fine, but position 3 is T. However, we don't know if T can be in position 3. Also, we have two T's? But the feedback for ""hasty"" only showed one T (in position 4) and one Y (in position 5). If the secret word has two T's, then when we guessed ""hasty"", which has one T in position 4, we would have gotten a check for that T, but if there is another T in position 3, it would have been marked as absent or misplaced? In ""hasty"", we have S in position 3, which was absent. If the secret word had a T in position 3, then when we guessed ""hasty"", the T in position 4 would be correct (which it was), but the T in position 3 of the secret word would not be reflected because we didn't guess a T in position 3. We guessed S in position 3, which is absent, so no issue. So it is possible for the secret word to have a T in position 3? But we don't have any information about position 3 except that it cannot be S (from ""hasty"" feedback: S(x)) and cannot be the absent letters.

But in ""BATTY"", we have T in position 3. However, we also have T in position 4. The word ""BATTY"" is valid. But we must check if the letters are allowed: B is available, A is already in position 2, T in position 3 and 4? But we are going to put T in position 3? But we know position 4 is T, so if we put T in position 3, that's a duplicate. But is duplicate allowed? We don't know. The rules don't prohibit duplicates. However, in the feedback for ""hasty"", we only got one T marked as correct (position 4), but that doesn't tell us if there is another T. Similarly, we got Y correct in position 5, but no information about other Y's.

But in this case, for ""BATTY"", the pattern would be: B (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), Y (5). So position 3 is T and position 4 is T. Now, when we guessed ""hasty"", which has S in position 3 (absent) and T in position 4 (correct). The secret word's T in position 3 was not guessed, so it didn't show up. That's fine. But we don't know if the word has two T's.

However, we are trying to guess the word, so we can consider ""BATTY"" as a candidate.

But we must avoid absent letters. B is available, T is already in the word (but we are using it again, which is allowed if duplicates are allowed). Y is also in the word.

But let's see the available letters for the missing positions: we need a letter for position 1 and position 3.

In ""BATTY"", position 1 is B, position 3 is T.

But T is already in position 4. Is that allowed? Yes, if the word has two T's.

But we don't have any evidence against duplicates.

Other candidates:

- PATTY: P, A, T, T, Y -> similar to BATTY, but position 3 is T and position 4 is T? Pattern: P(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5). But we need position 4 to be T, which it is. But again, duplicate T.

- MARTY: M, A, R, T, Y -> but R is absent.

- CATTY: C is absent.

- FATTY: F, A, T, T, Y -> F is available? F is not in the absent list. So FATTY is a candidate.

But again, duplicate T.

- WARTY: W, A, R, T, Y -> R absent.

- PARTY: R absent.

- DATTY: D absent.

- GATTY: G, A, T, T, Y -> G available.

But all these have duplicate T.

Are there words without duplicate T?

For example, words with different letters:

- BALTY? Not a word.

- PALTY? Not a word.

- MALTY: M, A, L, T, Y -> M(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5). This has no duplicate. And L is available.

Similarly, ""SALTY"": but S is absent.

""KATTY"" -> duplicate T? K, A, T, T, Y -> duplicate.

""VATTY"" -> not common.

""JAZZY"" -> J, A, Z, Z, Y -> but we need T in position 4? No, position 4 must be T.

The word must have T in position 4 and Y in position 5.

So the third letter can be something else.

Another word: ""TAWNY"" -> T, A, W, N, Y -> but T is in position 1? We need position 1 to be unknown, but in ""TAWNY"", position 1 is T, but we don't know if T can be in position 1? Also, we have A in position 2, which is correct, but position 3 is W, position 4 is N? But N is absent. And we need position 4 to be T, but it's N. So not.

""TASTY"" -> T, A, S, T, Y -> but S is absent, and T in position 1 and 4? Duplicate T, and S absent.

Back to ""MALTY"": M, A, L, T, Y -> this seems valid. M is available, L is available, T and Y are placed.

Similarly, ""PALTY"" is not a word, but ""PALSY"" is a word but ends with SY, not TY.

""WALTZ"" -> ends with Z, not TY.

""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> but we need position 4 to be T, but it's M. So not.

We need position 4 to be T, so the word must end with ""TY"", but with a letter in between? The pattern is ?A?TY, so the last three letters are ? T Y, but the ? is the third letter.

So the word is: [1]A[3]TY

So the third letter is before T.

Words: 
- MALTY: M A L T Y -> valid, meaning like malt.
- SALTY: but S absent.
- HALTY: not a word.
- CALTY: not a word.
- GALTY: not a word.
- PALTY: not a word.
- VALTY: not a word.
- WALTY: not a word.

Another one: ""DAFTY"" -> D absent.

""RAFTY"" -> R absent.

""HAFTY"" -> H absent.

""TAFTY"" -> T in position 1? Then A in 2, F in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. But duplicate T? And T in position 1 and 4. But we don't know if T can be in position 1. Also, F is available. But let's see: T(1), A(2), F(3), T(4), Y(5). This is ""TAFTY"" – is that a word? Not really, I think.

""KAPUT"" -> doesn't end with TY.

Perhaps ""BATTY"", ""FATTY"", ""PATTY"", ""MARTY"" (but R absent), ""CATTY"" (C absent), ""NATTY"" (N absent), ""RATTY"" (R absent), ""TATTY"" (T in position 1 and 4? duplicate).

But ""MALTY"" seems a valid option.

Another word: ""PANTY"" -> P, A, N, T, Y -> but N is absent.

""WANTY"" -> not common, and N? W, A, N, T, Y -> N absent.

""JANTY"" -> J, A, N, T, Y -> N absent.

""FASTY"" -> F, A, S, T, Y -> S absent.

So, with the available letters, ""MALTY"" is a candidate: M, A, L, T, Y.

We also have ""GALTY"" not a word, but ""GATTY"" is not standard.

""BALKY"" -> B, A, L, K, Y -> but we need position 4 to be T, but it's K. So not.

""PALMY"" -> P, A, L, M, Y -> position 4 is M, not T.

So, ""MALTY"" seems a good candidate.

But is there another word? What about ""BALMY""? No, because position 4 is M.

""TALKY"" -> T, A, L, K, Y -> position 1 is T, position 4 is K, not T.

We need position 4 to be T.

Another possibility: ""WASPY"" -> but S absent, and no T.

Perhaps we missed a word. Let's think of ""PARTY"" but R absent.

Maybe ""BAWTY""? Not a word.

Or ""MAWKY"" -> M, A, W, K, Y -> no T in position 4.

I think ""MALTY"" is one of the few options.

But let's confirm: ""malty"" is an adjective relating to malt, so it's valid.

Another word: ""PALTRY"" is 6 letters, too long.

So, we'll go with ""MALTY"".

But note: in ""MALTY"", the third letter is L. We don't have any information about L, so it might be present.

Also, we are testing M in position 1 and L in position 3.

If this is not the word, we get feedback on M and L.

But we have only 3 guesses left (since we used 3, and 6 total), so we can try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests more common letters, but we only have two positions to fill.

Another candidate: ""FAVTY"" not a word.

""JAVTY"" no.

Perhaps ""BATTY"" with duplicate T.

But let's see the feedback we got: in ""hasty"", we had T in position 4 correct, but if the secret word has T in position 3, we wouldn't know. But we have no evidence for or against duplicate T.

But to be safe, we can try ""MALTY"" first.

If we are wrong, we get feedback on M and L.

But there is another word: ""WALTZ"" is 5 letters but ends with Z, not Y.

I think ""MALTY"" is acceptable.

So, our guess: MALTY.

But let's double-check the pattern: M (1), A (2), L (3), T (4), Y (5). Matches _ A _ T Y.

And letters: M, L are not in the absent list.

So, we'll go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is misplaced (not in position 3), and C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (audio)**: A is misplaced (not in position 1), and U, D, I, O are absent.
- **Guess 3 (hasty)**: 
  - A is correct in position 2 (so the second letter is **A**).
  - T is correct in position 4 (so the fourth letter is **T**).
  - Y is correct in position 5 (so the fifth letter is **Y**).
  - H and S are absent.

### Deductions:
- The secret word pattern is: **? A ? T Y** (positions: 1=unknown, 2=A, 3=unknown, 4=T, 5=Y).
- **Absent letters** (cannot be used): C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.
- **Available letters** for positions 1 and 3: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since A, T, Y are already placed and duplicates are possible but unconfirmed).
- The word must include **A**, **T**, and **Y** in their fixed positions, with no other vowels possible (E, I, O, U are absent; Y is the only other vowel candidate and is already placed).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with available letters to form a valid English word.
- Prioritize common consonants (e.g., L, M, P) to test likely candidates.
- **Top candidate word**: **MALTY** (M in position 1, L in position 3). This word:
  - Fits the pattern `? A ? T Y` as `M A L T Y`.
  - Uses available letters (M and L not in absent list).
  - Tests two new high-frequency consonants (M and L).
  - Is a valid English word (meaning ""having the flavor of malt"").
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on M and L will narrow options (e.g., if M or L is absent, we can pivot to other words like `BATTY` or `PATTY` in future guesses).

   - This told us that A is in the word but not in position 1, and U, D, I, O are absent.

3. ""hasty"": H(x), A(✓), S(x), T(✓), Y(✓)
   - This told us that A is correct in position 2, T is correct in position 4, Y is correct in position 5, and H, S are absent.

4. ""malty"": M(x), A(✓), L(x), T(✓), Y(✓)
   - This tells us: A (position 2) is correct, T (position 4) is correct, Y (position 5) is correct, and M and L are absent.

From this, we know the secret word has the fixed pattern: _ A _ T Y (positions: 1,2,3,4,5 as unknown, A, unknown, T, Y).

We also know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, M, L. Therefore, the absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, M, L.

The available letters for positions 1 and 3 are from the remaining alphabet: B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Note that the word must be a valid English word ending with ""A?TY"" but specifically the pattern is ?A?TY.

We need to form a word with:
- Position 1: one of B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: one of B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (different from position 1, unless duplicates are allowed, but we haven't encountered duplicates yet so we'll avoid for now)
- Positions 4 and 5: T and Y (fixed)

Now, we need to think of words that fit ?A?TY.

Possible words:
- ""PARTY"": But R and P? R is absent, and also we have S in ""party"" but S is absent? Wait, ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y. R is absent (from guess1), and also S not in it, but R is absent so invalid.

- ""BATTY"": B, A, T, T, Y? But position 3 must be T? Pattern: position 1: B, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: T, 5: Y. So if we put T in position 3, then we have: B, A, T, T, Y. This duplicates T, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, T is already confirmed in position 4. For position 3, we could have T? Then it's ""BATTY"".

Similarly, ""PATTY"", ""FATTY"", ""CATTY"" (C absent), ""NATTY"" (N absent), ""RATTY"" (R absent), ""WATTY"", ""KATTY"", ""JATTY"", etc.

But ""CATTY"" has C absent, ""NATTY"" has N absent, ""RATTY"" has R absent, so discard.

But ""PATTY"": P, A, T, T, Y -> duplicate T? And position 3 is T.

""FATTY"": F, A, T, T, Y.

But are there any words without duplicate T? For example, ""DAVTY"" is not a word. Let's look for other words.

Another word: ""KAPUT"" but doesn't end with TY.

""GAWKY"" -> G, A, W, K, Y -> but position 4 must be T, it's K. So no.

""JAWED"" -> not ending in TY.

Given our available letters, the only common words seem to be ones with duplicate T, like ""BATTY"", ""PATTY"", ""FATTY"". 

We also have ""PASTY"" but S is absent and doesn't fit pattern.

Or ""HASTY"" but H and S absent and we already guessed it.

Another possibility: ""TAWNY"" -> T, A, W, N, Y -> N absent and position 4 is N, not T.

""TAFFY"" -> T, A, F, F, Y -> duplicate F? And position 4 is F, not T.

We need position 4 to be T.

So, given the constraints, the best candidates are words like ""BATTY"", ""PATTY"", ""FATTY"", etc.

Now, note: in our guess ""hasty"", we had T in position 4, and the feedback was correct, but that doesn't tell us if there is another T. Similarly, in ""malty"", we had T in position 4 and it was correct.

But if the secret word has duplicate T, then we wouldn't have seen it because we haven't guessed T in another position.

Therefore, duplicates are possible.

Moreover, since we have limited options, we should try ""BATTY"" or another.

Let's list candidate words:
- BATTY: B, A, T, T, Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y -> this has T in position 3 and 4. But we need position 4 to be T (which it is), and position 3 is T. We need to check if B, A, T, T, Y form a word: yes, ""batty"" is valid.

Similarly:
- PATTY: P, A, T, T, Y -> same pattern? P(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5) -> note: in this case, position 3 is T, position 4 is T, but in the pattern we need position 3 to be an unknown, but we can put T there? Yes.

But note: in our fixed positions, position 4 is T, so if we put a word with T in position 3, that's acceptable as long as the letters are available.

Similarly, FATTY: F, A, T, T, Y.

WATTY: W, A, T, T, Y -> is this a word? Not common, but ""watty"" might be a surname or rare, but we can consider.

KATTY: similarly.

But ""batty"", ""fatty"", ""patty"" are common.

Also, ""CATTY"" was invalid.

Now, we also have other words? What about ""GABBY""? Ends with BY.

Or ""JABOT""? Not ending with TY.

So, we'll choose ""BATTY"" as our next guess.

But note: in ""BATTY"", we are using T in position 3. We haven't tested T in any position other than position 4. Also, B is available.

Similarly, we can choose ""PATTY"".

Let's pick ""BATTY"".

If we are correct, we win. If not, the feedback might show:

- If position 1 is B and correct? Or not? And position 3 is T, which might be correct or absent.

But since the pattern is fixed except positions 1 and 3, and we are testing B and T.

Alternatively, we can try ""PAWTY""? Not a word.

I think ""BATTY"" is a good try.

So, we'll guess ""BATTY"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is misplaced (not in position 3); C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (audio)**: A is misplaced (not in position 1); U, D, I, O are absent.
- **Guess 3 (hasty)**: 
  - A, T, Y are correct in positions 2, 4, and 5 (→ word pattern: `? A ? T Y`).
  - H and S are absent.
- **Guess 4 (malty)**:
  - A (position 2), T (position 4), Y (position 5) are confirmed correct again.
  - M and L are absent.

### Deductions:
- **Fixed pattern**: The secret word is `? A ? T Y` (positions: 1=unknown, 2=A, 3=unknown, 4=T, 5=Y).
- **Absent letters (excluded)**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, M, L (all letters tested so far except A, T, Y).
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 3**: B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since duplicates are possible but unconfirmed).
- **Key constraints**: The word must be a valid English word ending in `...ATY`, with positions 1 and 3 filled from the available letters.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Pattern requirement**: The word must fit `? A ? T Y`, prioritizing common letters from the available pool (e.g., B, P, F, K).
- **Top candidate**: **BATTY** (B in position 1, T in position 3). This word:
  - Fits the pattern as `B A T T Y`.
  - Uses available letters (B not absent; T is already placed but duplicates are allowed).
  - Tests B (common consonant) and confirms if position 3 is T.
  - Is a valid English word (meaning ""eccentric or crazy"").
- **Why not other options?**  
  - `?` positions can't reuse absent letters (e.g., S in ""tasty"" or R in ""party"").  
  - Words like ""FATTY"" or ""PATTY"" are viable backups, but ""BATTY"" tests a new letter (B) efficiently.  
- **Risk**: If incorrect, feedback on B and T (position 3) will narrow options further (e.g., if B is absent, try ""PATTY""; if T is absent, test other consonants like K or F).

Also, we must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.\n\nWe need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:\n- Does not contain C, R, N, E.\n- Includes the letter A, but not in the third position.\n\nWe also want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have the letter A and avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nOne common strategy is to try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common consonants.\n\nPossible positions for A: since it can\'t be in position 3, we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nLet\'s list some candidate words:\n\n- A in position 1: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""APART"", ""APPLE"", etc.\n  But note: we cannot use E (from ABOUT, ABOVE, AFTER, APART) because E is eliminated. Also, we cannot use R (in ABOUT, AFTER, APART) because R is eliminated.\n\n  So, we need words without E and R.\n\n  For example: \n    ""ALONG"": A, L, O, N, G -> but N is eliminated, so not allowed.\n    ""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E -> E is eliminated and also repeated P? But the word is valid, but we cannot use E. So not allowed.\n\n  Let\'s try ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> all new letters? But we don\'t know if they are in the word. This word has A in position 1 and avoids the forbidden letters.\n\n- A in position 2: words like ""PASTA"", but S and T are new, but we have A in position 2 and then T in position 3? But we cannot use E, R, etc. Also, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5? But we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates? The rules don\'t say the secret word has distinct letters, so duplicates are possible. However, in our feedback for ""crane"", we only have one A and it was marked as present, so if there were two A\'s, we might have gotten two marks? But the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we have only one A in ""crane"", we only know that at least one A is present. The secret word might have more than one A.\n\n  But for now, let\'s avoid duplicates to maximize information.\n\n  ""SAULT"": but U, L, T? But we don\'t have E, R? Actually, ""SAULT"" is not a common word. How about ""SALAD""? But that has two A\'s and we don\'t know if that\'s good. Also, we want to avoid known absent letters.\n\n  Let\'s think of ""PAINT"": but N is eliminated, so not allowed.\n\n  ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. This avoids forbidden letters.\n\n- A in position 4: words like ""PLANT"" -> but N is eliminated, so not allowed. ""TRACK"" -> R and C are eliminated. ""BLAZE"" -> E is eliminated.\n\n  ""FOCAL"": F, O, C, A, L -> but C is eliminated, so not allowed.\n\n  ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E is eliminated.\n\n  It\'s getting tricky.\n\n- A in position 5: words like ""PIZZA"", but Z is not common. ""AROMA"" -> but A is repeated and we have R which is eliminated. ""OUTLA"" not a word.\n\n  ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated and A repeated.\n\nGiven the constraints, let\'s try to form a word without the forbidden letters and with A in a position other than 3.\n\nWe can try A in position 1: \n  Without E, R, C, N: \n    Words: AUDIO, AUDIT, AVOID, ATOLL, ATOMS, etc.\n\nAUDIO: A, U, D, I, O -> all new letters and no duplicates. This is a good candidate because it covers 5 new vowels and consonants.\n\nWe can try A in position 2:\n  Words: SALAD (but duplicate A and we don\'t know if duplicate is good, and D is new), \n          PAGAN (but G and N, N is eliminated), \n          MAJOR (but R is eliminated), \n          TABBY (duplicate B? and Y is new), \n          HABIT (H, A, B, I, T) -> no forbidden letters.\n\nHABIT: H, A, B, I, T -> A in position 2, and we get to test H, B, I, T.\n\nSimilarly, we can consider A in position 4: \n  Words: OPTAL (not common), \n          FOCAL (has C, eliminated), \n          LEGAL (has E, eliminated), \n          ROTAL (has R, eliminated), \n          VITAL (V, I, T, A, L) -> no forbidden letters? V, I, T, A, L. So A in position 4.\n\nVITAL: V, I, T, A, L -> covers V, I, T, L and A in position 4.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the secret word has A in position 1,2,4, or 5. We want to test A in a position that we haven\'t tried and that is likely.\n\nSince we have no information about other positions, we can choose a word that tests A in a new position and also tests many common letters.\n\nConsidering the above, two strong candidates are:\n1. AUDIO: tests A in position 1 and U, D, I, O.\n2. HABIT: tests A in position 2 and H, B, I, T.\n\nWe can also consider:\n3. VITAL: tests A in position 4 and V, I, T, L.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more common letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PASTA"" -> but P, A, S, T, A -> duplicate A and we don\'t know if that\'s efficient. Also, A is in position 2 and 5. But we know A is present at least once, so if we get two A\'s in the feedback, we know there are two. But it might be better to avoid duplicates to test more letters.\n\nTherefore, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it uses 5 new letters and places A in a new position (position 1). Also, it covers multiple vowels (A, I, O, U) and one consonant (D), which might help us narrow down the vowels in the word.\n\nAlternatively, ""HABIT"" tests more consonants (H, B, T) and one vowel (I) and A.\n\nBut since we know A is in the word, and we don\'t know about vowels, testing multiple vowels might be good.\n\nHowever, note that the feedback for ""crane"" showed that E is absent, so the secret word might have other vowels: A (we know), and possibly I, O, U.\n\nSo ""AUDIO"" tests A, U, D, I, O.\n\nBut D is a consonant. This word has 4 vowels and one consonant.\n\nAnother option: ""ADIEU"" is a common starter, but it has E and we know E is absent, so we cannot use it.\n\nSo, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if ""AUDIO"" is a valid word: yes, it is.\n\nSo, I will go with ""AUDIO"".\n\nBut note: we must avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""AUDIO"" does not contain any of these.\n\nTherefore, our next guess: AUDIO.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **A** is present but not in position 3 (misplaced).\n- **C, R, N, E** are absent (not in the word).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** (since it\'s confirmed present) but **not in position 3**.\n- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters and positions to maximize information.\n\nThe word **AUDIO** is chosen because:\n- It includes **A** in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- It introduces 4 new common letters (**U, D, I, O**), covering vowels and consonants.\n- It avoids forbidden letters and repeats, helping identify additional correct/absent letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>audio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\n1.

The only vowel left is possibly Y? But note: A is already in the word, and we know E, I, O, U are absent. So the only vowel we have is A and possibly Y.\n\nConsonants: We have tested C, R, N, D. So we have many left: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: Y can be a vowel or consonant, but in this case, since we are missing vowels, we should consider Y as a vowel possibility.\n\nSo the word must have A and possibly Y as the only vowel? Because E, I, O, U are out.\n\nTherefore, the secret word likely has A and maybe Y, and the rest are consonants from the available set.\n\nWe should try to cover as many common consonants as possible and also test the position of A.\n\nPossible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A in one of these positions and use only the available letters.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.\n\nWe can try:\n\n- A in position 2: \n  - Words: _ A _ _ _\n  - Examples: ""BASTY"" (but is that a word? not really), ""PASTY"" (a word, meaning like a pastry), ""HASTY"", ""NASTY"" (but N is out), ""MASTY"" (not common). \n  - Since N is out, we can try ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> but we haven\'t tested H, S, T, Y. And A in position 2.\n\n- A in position 4:\n  - Words: _ _ _ A _\n  - Examples: ""PLANT"" (N out), ""SLANT"" (N out), ""BLAST"" (but we have A in position 4? B, L, A, S, T -> A is in position 3? Wait, let\'s index: position 1: B, 2: L, 3: A, 4: S, 5: T -> but we know A cannot be in position 3. So we need A in position 4. \n  - How about ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P -> A is in position 3? No, that\'s position 3 again. We need position 4: so the fourth letter is A. \n  - Example: ""VISTA"" -> V, I, S, T, A -> but I is out. \n  - ""FOCAL"" -> O and C out. \n  - ""LYCRA"" -> L, Y, C, R, A -> C and R out. \n  - It\'s tricky. How about ""BYLAW"": B, Y, L, A, W -> A in position 4. This uses B, Y, L, W. And avoids forbidden letters.\n\n- A in position 5:\n  - Words: _ _ _ _ A\n  - Examples: ""PIZZA"" (Z is not common, and we have I out), ""TABLA"" (T, A, B, L, A -> duplicate A? and A in position 2 and 5, but we don\'t know if duplicate is allowed). \n  - ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> N out. \n  - ""ALGAE"" -> E out and A in position 1 which we know is not allowed? Actually, in ""ALGAE"", A is in position 1 and 5? But we know A cannot be in position 1. \n  - We need a word with A only at the end. \n  - Example: ""ULTRA"" -> U and R out. \n  - ""EXTRA"" -> E and R out. \n  - ""OCTAL"" -> O and C out. \n  - ""FATWA"": F, A, T, W, A -> A in position 2 and 5? But we can have A at the end. However, we are testing A in position 5. But note: we also have A in position 2, which we know is a possible position? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. \n  - Alternatively, ""SALSA"": S, A, L, S, A -> A in position 2 and 5, and duplicate S. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. \n\nGiven the constraints, let\'s list some candidate words that are valid and avoid the forbidden letters and have A in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nCandidate 1: ""HASTY"" \n  - H, A, S, T, Y\n  - A in position 2\n  - Tests H, S, T, Y (all new) and A (which we know is present, but we are testing position 2)\n\nCandidate 2: ""PASTY""\n  - P, A, S, T, Y\n  - A in position 2\n  - Tests P, S, T, Y\n\nCandidate 3: ""BYLAW""\n  - B, Y, L, A, W\n  - A in position 4\n  - Tests B, Y, L, W\n\nCandidate 4: ""GAMMA"" \n  - G, A, M, M, A -> but duplicate M and duplicate A? And A is in position 2 and 5. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are testing A in position 2 and 5? But we know A is present, so if we get two A\'s in feedback, we know there are two. However, it uses duplicate M which might not be efficient for information.\n\nBut note: we only have 4 guesses left (since we used 2, and we have 6 total). We want to maximize information.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SASSY"" -> but duplicate S and Y, and A is not present? We must include A.\n\nWe must include A.\n\nAnother idea: ""TAFFY"" -> T, A, F, F, Y -> A in position 2, and duplicate F. But we test T, F, Y.\n\nBut duplicate letters might not be ideal because we get less information.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid duplicates if possible.\n\nTherefore, ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY"" are good because they have no duplicates and test 4 new letters.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHALT"" -> S, H, A, L, T -> A in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So invalid.\n\n""PLATY"" -> P, L, A, T, Y -> A in position 3? Again, position 3 is invalid.\n\nSo for position 2: ""HASTY"", ""PASTY"", ""BAWDY"" (B, A, W, D, Y -> but D is out? D is absent, so we cannot use D). D is absent from the feedback of ""audio"".\n\nIn ""audio"", D was marked absent, so we cannot use D.\n\nSimilarly, in ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> all are new and not forbidden? \nForbidden: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. So H, S, T, Y are allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""PASTY"": P, A, S, T, Y -> same.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if Y is allowed. We haven\'t tested it, so it\'s okay.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MAWKY"" (meaning sullen) -> M, A, W, K, Y -> A in position 2. Tests M, W, K, Y.\n\nBut ""HASTY"" and ""PASTY"" are more common.\n\nWe can also consider A in position 5: \n  ""PHYLA"" -> P, H, Y, L, A -> A in position 5. Tests P, H, Y, L.\n\nBut ""PHYLA"" is a word (plural of phylum).\n\nHowever, we don\'t know if the word has Y. We need to test it.\n\nBut note: we have very few vowels left. Since E, I, O, U are absent, the only vowels can be A and Y (if Y is used as a vowel). So it\'s important to test Y.\n\nIn fact, the secret word might have Y.\n\nSo both ""HASTY"" and ""PHYLA"" are good.\n\nBut ""HASTY"" has A in position 2, which is one of the possible positions, and tests S and T which are very common.\n\nSimilarly, ""PHYLA"" tests P, H, Y, L and A in position 5.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common consonants. S and T are very common.\n\nSo ""HASTY"" or ""PASTY"" are good.\n\nBut note: we also want to test the position of A. If we put A in position 2, and if it turns out to be correct, we know A is in position 2. If not, then A must be in 4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, if we put A in position 5 and it\'s correct, we know. But if we put it in position 2 and it\'s wrong, we still have positions 4 and 5.\n\nBut we have to cover as many letters as possible.\n\nI think ""HASTY"" is a good choice because:\n- It tests A in position 2 (if it\'s correct, we get a check, if not, we know it\'s misplaced and then we know it must be in 4 or 5).\n- It tests H, S, T, Y, which are common.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""HASTY"".\n\nBut wait, is ""HASTY"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nTherefore, our next guess: HASTY.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **A** is confirmed present but not in positions 1 or 3 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).\n- **C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O** are confirmed absent and cannot be used.\n- The secret word likely contains **A** and possibly **Y** (as the only untested vowel), with consonants from the remaining pool (B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** in position 2, 4, or 5 to test its location.\n- Prioritize testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, H) and the vowel Y.\n- Avoid duplicate letters to maximize information gain.\n\n**Why ""HASTY""?**\n- Places **A in position 2** (testing one of the valid positions).\n- Introduces **H, S, T, Y** (all untested letters; S and T are high-frequency consonants, Y is a key vowel candidate).\n- Avoids forbidden letters and repeats, ensuring efficient feedback.\n- If **A** is correct in position 2, we get immediate confirmation. If not, we narrow its position to 4 or 5 while checking four new letters.\n\n<guess>hasty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: hasty -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) S(x) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\n1.

So the word pattern is: _ A _ T Y\n- The first and third letters are unknown, but we know:\n  - The first letter cannot be H, and the third letter cannot be S (since S is absent).\n- Additionally, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.\n\nWe also know that A is in the word, but we already have it in position 2, and T and Y are also in the word and correctly placed.\n\nNow, we need to find a word that fits the pattern _ A _ T Y.\n\nThe missing letters are the first and third positions.\n\nWe must avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s list possible letters for the first and third positions.\n\nAvailable letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven\'t tested or that are not absent:\nWe have tested: A, C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, T, Y.\n\nBut note: T and Y are in the word and placed, so they are present. But we are only missing two letters.\n\nThe absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.\n\nSo available letters: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nWe also have A, T, Y, but they are already placed, so we don\'t need to use them again unless the word has duplicates? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven\'t seen any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now. Since A, T, Y are already in the word, we cannot use them again in the first or third position.\n\nTherefore, the first and third positions must be filled with two distinct letters from: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nNow, we need to form a word: [letter1] A [letter3] T Y\n\nWe can try to think of common words that end with ""ATY"" but note the pattern is _ A _ T Y, so the last three are A, then a letter, then T, Y? No: the word is: position 1: ?, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: T, 5: Y.\n\nSo the word has the form: ?A?TY\n\nCommon words that end with ""TY"" are often like ""party"", ""dirty"", but we have ""A"" in the second position.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have the pattern: _ A _ T Y\n\nExamples:\n- PARTY: P, A, R, T, Y -> but R is absent (from guess1: R(x)), so not allowed.\n- DARTY: D is absent (from guess2: D(x)), and R absent.\n- BATTY: B, A, T, T, Y -> but T is repeated? And in position 3 we have T? Let\'s see: B (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), Y (5). But we need position 4 to be T, which it is, but position 3 is T. However, we have two T\'s? But the feedback for ""hasty"" had T in position 4 and 5? No, in ""hasty"": H, A, S, T, Y -> position 4 is T and position 5 is Y. So in the secret word, position 4 is T and 5 is Y. In ""BATTY"", we have T in position 3 and 4? That would be: position 3: T, position 4: T? But we need position 4 to be T, which is fine, but position 3 is T. However, we don\'t know if T can be in position 3. Also, we have two T\'s? But the feedback for ""hasty"" only showed one T (in position 4) and one Y (in position 5). If the secret word has two T\'s, then when we guessed ""hasty"", which has one T in position 4, we would have gotten a check for that T, but if there is another T in position 3, it would have been marked as absent or misplaced? In ""hasty"", we have S in position 3, which was absent. If the secret word had a T in position 3, then when we guessed ""hasty"", the T in position 4 would be correct (which it was), but the T in position 3 of the secret word would not be reflected because we didn\'t guess a T in position 3. We guessed S in position 3, which is absent, so no issue. So it is possible for the secret word to have a T in position 3? But we don\'t have any information about position 3 except that it cannot be S (from ""hasty"" feedback: S(x)) and cannot be the absent letters.\n\nBut in ""BATTY"", we have T in position 3. However, we also have T in position 4. The word ""BATTY"" is valid. But we must check if the letters are allowed: B is available, A is already in position 2, T in position 3 and 4? But we are going to put T in position 3? But we know position 4 is T, so if we put T in position 3, that\'s a duplicate. But is duplicate allowed? We don\'t know. The rules don\'t prohibit duplicates. However, in the feedback for ""hasty"", we only got one T marked as correct (position 4), but that doesn\'t tell us if there is another T. Similarly, we got Y correct in position 5, but no information about other Y\'s.\n\nBut in this case, for ""BATTY"", the pattern would be: B (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), Y (5). So position 3 is T and position 4 is T. Now, when we guessed ""hasty"", which has S in position 3 (absent) and T in position 4 (correct). The secret word\'s T in position 3 was not guessed, so it didn\'t show up. That\'s fine. But we don\'t know if the word has two T\'s.\n\nHowever, we are trying to guess the word, so we can consider ""BATTY"" as a candidate.\n\nBut we must avoid absent letters. B is available, T is already in the word (but we are using it again, which is allowed if duplicates are allowed). Y is also in the word.\n\nBut let\'s see the available letters for the missing positions: we need a letter for position 1 and position 3.\n\nIn ""BATTY"", position 1 is B, position 3 is T.\n\nBut T is already in position 4. Is that allowed? Yes, if the word has two T\'s.\n\nBut we don\'t have any evidence against duplicates.\n\nOther candidates:\n\n- PATTY: P, A, T, T, Y -> similar to BATTY, but position 3 is T and position 4 is T? Pattern: P(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5). But we need position 4 to be T, which it is. But again, duplicate T.\n\n- MARTY: M, A, R, T, Y -> but R is absent.\n\n- CATTY: C is absent.\n\n- FATTY: F, A, T, T, Y -> F is available? F is not in the absent list. So FATTY is a candidate.\n\nBut again, duplicate T.\n\n- WARTY: W, A, R, T, Y -> R absent.\n\n- PARTY: R absent.\n\n- DATTY: D absent.\n\n- GATTY: G, A, T, T, Y -> G available.\n\nBut all these have duplicate T.\n\nAre there words without duplicate T?\n\nFor example, words with different letters:\n\n- BALTY? Not a word.\n\n- PALTY? Not a word.\n\n- MALTY: M, A, L, T, Y -> M(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5). This has no duplicate. And L is available.\n\nSimilarly, ""SALTY"": but S is absent.\n\n""KATTY"" -> duplicate T? K, A, T, T, Y -> duplicate.\n\n""VATTY"" -> not common.\n\n""JAZZY"" -> J, A, Z, Z, Y -> but we need T in position 4? No, position 4 must be T.\n\nThe word must have T in position 4 and Y in position 5.\n\nSo the third letter can be something else.\n\nAnother word: ""TAWNY"" -> T, A, W, N, Y -> but T is in position 1? We need position 1 to be unknown, but in ""TAWNY"", position 1 is T, but we don\'t know if T can be in position 1? Also, we have A in position 2, which is correct, but position 3 is W, position 4 is N? But N is absent. And we need position 4 to be T, but it\'s N. So not.\n\n""TASTY"" -> T, A, S, T, Y -> but S is absent, and T in position 1 and 4? Duplicate T, and S absent.\n\nBack to ""MALTY"": M, A, L, T, Y -> this seems valid. M is available, L is available, T and Y are placed.\n\nSimilarly, ""PALTY"" is not a word, but ""PALSY"" is a word but ends with SY, not TY.\n\n""WALTZ"" -> ends with Z, not TY.\n\n""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> but we need position 4 to be T, but it\'s M. So not.\n\nWe need position 4 to be T, so the word must end with ""TY"", but with a letter in between? The pattern is ?A?TY, so the last three letters are ? T Y, but the ? is the third letter.\n\nSo the word is: [1]A[3]TY\n\nSo the third letter is before T.\n\nWords: \n- MALTY: M A L T Y -> valid, meaning like malt.\n- SALTY: but S absent.\n- HALTY: not a word.\n- CALTY: not a word.\n- GALTY: not a word.\n- PALTY: not a word.\n- VALTY: not a word.\n- WALTY: not a word.\n\nAnother one: ""DAFTY"" -> D absent.\n\n""RAFTY"" -> R absent.\n\n""HAFTY"" -> H absent.\n\n""TAFTY"" -> T in position 1? Then A in 2, F in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. But duplicate T? And T in position 1 and 4. But we don\'t know if T can be in position 1. Also, F is available. But let\'s see: T(1), A(2), F(3), T(4), Y(5). This is ""TAFTY"" – is that a word? Not really, I think.\n\n""KAPUT"" -> doesn\'t end with TY.\n\nPerhaps ""BATTY"", ""FATTY"", ""PATTY"", ""MARTY"" (but R absent), ""CATTY"" (C absent), ""NATTY"" (N absent), ""RATTY"" (R absent), ""TATTY"" (T in position 1 and 4? duplicate).\n\nBut ""MALTY"" seems a valid option.\n\nAnother word: ""PANTY"" -> P, A, N, T, Y -> but N is absent.\n\n""WANTY"" -> not common, and N? W, A, N, T, Y -> N absent.\n\n""JANTY"" -> J, A, N, T, Y -> N absent.\n\n""FASTY"" -> F, A, S, T, Y -> S absent.\n\nSo, with the available letters, ""MALTY"" is a candidate: M, A, L, T, Y.\n\nWe also have ""GALTY"" not a word, but ""GATTY"" is not standard.\n\n""BALKY"" -> B, A, L, K, Y -> but we need position 4 to be T, but it\'s K. So not.\n\n""PALMY"" -> P, A, L, M, Y -> position 4 is M, not T.\n\nSo, ""MALTY"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut is there another word? What about ""BALMY""? No, because position 4 is M.\n\n""TALKY"" -> T, A, L, K, Y -> position 1 is T, position 4 is K, not T.\n\nWe need position 4 to be T.\n\nAnother possibility: ""WASPY"" -> but S absent, and no T.\n\nPerhaps we missed a word. Let\'s think of ""PARTY"" but R absent.\n\nMaybe ""BAWTY""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""MAWKY"" -> M, A, W, K, Y -> no T in position 4.\n\nI think ""MALTY"" is one of the few options.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: ""malty"" is an adjective relating to malt, so it\'s valid.\n\nAnother word: ""PALTRY"" is 6 letters, too long.\n\nSo, we\'ll go with ""MALTY"".\n\nBut note: in ""MALTY"", the third letter is L. We don\'t have any information about L, so it might be present.\n\nAlso, we are testing M in position 1 and L in position 3.\n\nIf this is not the word, we get feedback on M and L.\n\nBut we have only 3 guesses left (since we used 3, and 6 total), so we can try.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests more common letters, but we only have two positions to fill.\n\nAnother candidate: ""FAVTY"" not a word.\n\n""JAVTY"" no.\n\nPerhaps ""BATTY"" with duplicate T.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we got: in ""hasty"", we had T in position 4 correct, but if the secret word has T in position 3, we wouldn\'t know. But we have no evidence for or against duplicate T.\n\nBut to be safe, we can try ""MALTY"" first.\n\nIf we are wrong, we get feedback on M and L.\n\nBut there is another word: ""WALTZ"" is 5 letters but ends with Z, not Y.\n\nI think ""MALTY"" is acceptable.\n\nSo, our guess: MALTY.\n\nBut let\'s double-check the pattern: M (1), A (2), L (3), T (4), Y (5). Matches _ A _ T Y.\n\nAnd letters: M, L are not in the absent list.\n\nSo, we\'ll go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is misplaced (not in position 3), and C, R, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (audio)**: A is misplaced (not in position 1), and U, D, I, O are absent.\n- **Guess 3 (hasty)**: \n  - A is correct in position 2 (so the second letter is **A**).\n  - T is correct in position 4 (so the fourth letter is **T**).\n  - Y is correct in position 5 (so the fifth letter is **Y**).\n  - H and S are absent.\n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word pattern is: **? A ? T Y** (positions: 1=unknown, 2=A, 3=unknown, 4=T, 5=Y).\n- **Absent letters** (cannot be used): C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S.\n- **Available letters** for positions 1 and 3: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since A, T, Y are already placed and duplicates are possible but unconfirmed).\n- The word must include **A**, **T**, and **Y** in their fixed positions, with no other vowels possible (E, I, O, U are absent; Y is the only other vowel candidate and is already placed).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with available letters to form a valid English word.\n- Prioritize common consonants (e.g., L, M, P) to test likely candidates.\n- **Top candidate word**: **MALTY** (M in position 1, L in position 3). This word:\n  - Fits the pattern `? A ? T Y` as `M A L T Y`.\n  - Uses available letters (M and L not in absent list).\n  - Tests two new high-frequency consonants (M and L).\n  - Is a valid English word (meaning ""having the flavor of malt"").\n- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on M and L will narrow options (e.g., if M or L is absent, we can pivot to other words like `BATTY` or `PATTY` in future guesses).\n\n<guess>malty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: hasty -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) S(x) T(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: malty -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) L(x) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for four guesses:\n\n1.

So if we put T in position 3, then we have: B, A, T, T, Y. This duplicates T, but we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, T is already confirmed in position 4.

So no.\n\n""JAWED"" -> not ending in TY.\n\nGiven our available letters, the only common words seem to be ones with duplicate T, like ""BATTY"", ""PATTY"", ""FATTY"". \n\nWe also have ""PASTY"" but S is absent and doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\nOr ""HASTY"" but H and S absent and we already guessed it.\n\nAnother possibility: ""TAWNY"" -> T, A, W, N, Y -> N absent and position 4 is N, not T.\n\n""TAFFY"" -> T, A, F, F, Y -> duplicate F? And position 4 is F, not T.\n\nWe need position 4 to be T.\n\nSo, given the constraints, the best candidates are words like ""BATTY"", ""PATTY"", ""FATTY"", etc.\n\nNow, note: in our guess ""hasty"", we had T in position 4, and the feedback was correct, but that doesn\'t tell us if there is another T. Similarly, in ""malty"", we had T in position 4 and it was correct.\n\nBut if the secret word has duplicate T, then we wouldn\'t have seen it because we haven\'t guessed T in another position.\n\nTherefore, duplicates are possible.\n\nMoreover, since we have limited options, we should try ""BATTY"" or another.\n\nLet\'s list candidate words:\n- BATTY: B, A, T, T, Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y -> this has T in position 3 and 4. But we need position 4 to be T (which it is), and position 3 is T. We need to check if B, A, T, T, Y form a word: yes, ""batty"" is valid.\n\nSimilarly:\n- PATTY: P, A, T, T, Y -> same pattern? P(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5) -> note: in this case, position 3 is T, position 4 is T, but in the pattern we need position 3 to be an unknown, but we can put T there? Yes.\n\nBut note: in our fixed positions, position 4 is T, so if we put a word with T in position 3, that\'s acceptable as long as the letters are available.\n\nSimilarly, FATTY: F, A, T, T, Y.\n\nWATTY: W, A, T, T, Y -> is this a word? Not common, but ""watty"" might be a surname or rare, but we can consider.\n\nKATTY: similarly.\n\nBut ""batty"", ""fatty"", ""patty"" are common.\n\nAlso, ""CATTY"" was invalid.\n\nNow, we also have other words? What about ""GABBY""? Ends with BY.\n\nOr ""JABOT""? Not ending with TY.\n\nSo, we\'ll choose ""BATTY"" as our next guess.\n\nBut note: in ""BATTY"", we are using T in position 3. We haven\'t tested T in any position other than position 4. Also, B is available.\n\nSimilarly, we can choose ""PATTY"".\n\nLet\'s pick ""BATTY"".\n\nIf we are correct, we win. If not, the feedback might show:\n\n- If position 1 is B and correct? Or not? And position 3 is T, which might be correct or absent.\n\nBut since the pattern is fixed except positions 1 and 3, and we are testing B and T.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""PAWTY""? Not a word.\n\nI think ""BATTY"" is a good try.\n\nSo, we\'ll guess ""BATTY"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is misplaced (not in position 3); C, R, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (audio)**: A is misplaced (not in position 1); U, D, I, O are absent.\n- **Guess 3 (hasty)**: \n  - A, T, Y are correct in positions 2, 4, and 5 (→ word pattern: `?

We are given feedback for five guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → A is present but not in position 3; C, R, N, E absent.
2. ""audio"": A(-), U(x), D(x), I(x), O(x) → A is present but not in position 1; U, D, I, O absent.
3. ""hasty"": H(x), A(✓), S(x), T(✓), Y(✓) → A correct in position 2, T correct in position 4, Y correct in position 5; H, S absent.
4. ""malty"": M(x), A(✓), L(x), T(✓), Y(✓) → A, T, Y correct in positions 2,4,5; M, L absent.
5. ""batty"": B(x), A(✓), T(✓), T(✓), Y(✓) → A correct in position 2, T correct in both positions 3 and 4? Wait, let's interpret:
   - The word ""batty"" is B, A, T, T, Y.
   - Feedback: B(x) → B is absent.
                A(✓) → A correct in position 2.
                T(✓) → T correct in position 3 (since it's the third letter? But note: the feedback has two T's marked as ✓).
                T(✓) → T correct in position 4? But the fourth letter is T.

However, in the feedback format, it should correspond to each position. Since there are two T's in ""batty"", in positions 3 and 4.

The feedback says: B(x) for position 1, A(✓) for position 2, first T(✓) for position 3, second T(✓) for position 4, Y(✓) for position 5.

Therefore, for ""batty"":
  - Position 1: B (absent)
  - Position 2: A (correct)
  - Position 3: T (correct)  ← This is new!
  - Position 4: T (correct) ← We already knew position 4 is T
  - Position 5: Y (correct)

This feedback tells us:
- The secret word has T in position 3 (new information) and in position 4 (we knew), so duplicate T's.
- But B is absent.
- Also, since position 3 is T and correct, the third letter is T.

Wait, but in the secret word, we now know:
- Position 1: unknown (but B is absent and we have no guess for it yet)
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: Y

But the pattern is now: ? A T T Y

However, we guessed ""batty"" which is B A T T Y, and we got:
  Position 1: B (x) → so the secret word's first letter is not B.
  Position 2: A (✓)
  Position 3: T (✓) → so the secret word's third letter is T? But we didn't know that before. Now we know.
  Position 4: T (✓) → already knew.
  Position 5: Y (✓) → already knew.

So now we know the secret word is _ A T T Y.

But we have only two possibilities for the first letter? No, we have many available letters, but B is absent.

We need to find a word that fits: ? A T T Y, and the first letter is not B, and avoids all absent letters.

Absent letters: From previous feedback: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, M, L, B.

So absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, M, L, B.

Available letters: F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

The word must start with one of these: F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, and then A T T Y.

But the word after the first letter must be ""ATTY"". So the whole word is X+ATTY.

We need an English word that ends with ""ATTY"" and starts with an available letter.

Possible words:
- PATTY: P + ATTY → P,A,T,T,Y
- FATTY: F,A,T,T,Y
- KATTY? Not common.
- WATTY? Not common.
- GATTY? Not common.

""Patty"" and ""Fatty"" are common words.

Other possibilities: ""Matty"" but M is absent.

""Natty"" but N is absent.

""Ratty"" but R is absent.

""Catty"" but C is absent.

So ""PATTY"" and ""FATTY"" are candidates.

We have two guesses left? We've used 5 guesses, so one more left.

We can choose either.

But note: in ""batty"", we tried B and it was absent. So we need to try either P or F.

Since P and F are both available, we can choose ""PATTY"" because P is more common.

Alternatively, we can choose ""FATTY"".

But we need to pick one.

Let's pick ""PATTY"".

So our guess: PATTY.

If it's not correct, we might have ""FATTY"" for the next guess, but we have only one guess left after this? No, this is guess 6? The game gives 6 tries.

We have used 5 guesses, so this is the sixth guess.

Therefore, if we guess wrong, we lose.

We must guess correctly.

So, the secret word must be either ""PATTY"" or ""FATTY"". But are there more?

What about ""WATTY""? Probably not a word.

""JATTY""? Not common.

So, let's see: common words ending in ATTY: patty, fatty, batty (we tried, wrong), catty (invalid), fatly? No.

So, between ""PATTY"" and ""FATTY"", we need to pick one.

We have tested P and F? No, we haven't tested them.

In ""patty"", P is in position 1. Similarly in ""fatty"", F.

But we have no information about P or F.

Therefore, we have to guess: let's choose ""PATTY"".

Alternatively, note that in the available letters, we have not used P or F.

Since there is no other clue, we can pick arbitrarily.

But note: the secret word could also be ""TATTY""? T,A,T,T,Y. But we already know position 1 is not T? Because in ""hasty"" and ""malty"", we didn't test T in position 1? Actually, we know position 1 is unknown. However, we have duplicate T's? But in ""tatty"", position 1 is T. The word would be T,A,T,T,Y. But note, position 3 and 4 are T, so we have T in position 1,2? Position 2 is A, not T.

So: T(1), A(2), T(3), T(4), Y(5)

Now, is T present in position 1? We tested ""hasty"" which had H in position 1 (absent) and ""malty"" had M in position 1 (absent), ""batty"" had B in position 1 (absent). But we never tested T in position 1.

However, T is in the word (positions 3 and 4), but it's already duplicated? So if the first letter is T, then we have three T's? But we don't know if that's allowed.

Moreover, for ""tatty"", if we check the feedback for ""hasty"": we had H in position 1 absent, but T was not tested there. Similarly, in ""malty"" M absent, in ""batty"" B absent. So it could be T.

But is ""tatty"" a word? Yes, meaning tattered or shabby.

So possible words: PATTY, FATTY, TATTY.

We have three candidates: fatty, patty, tatty.

But with only one guess left, we must pick one.

How to choose?

We know that the first letter cannot be B (absent), and must be from F, P, T, etc.

But T is already in the word twice? So if we put T in position 1, we'd have three T's? 

In the absent letter list, we don't have T as absent. From the feedback, T has been marked correct in positions 3 and 4 in ""batty"", but that doesn't preclude another T in position 1.

Similarly, Y is in position 5, but could it be elsewhere? But the guesses show only one Y in position 5, so no.

So it's possible that the first letter is T.

Therefore, we have three options: patty, fatty, tatty.

But we have only one guess.

We need to pick the most likely.

But we have no information about which letter is more common.

We can arbitrarily choose ""patty"".

But note: we haven't tested P or F at all. T has been partially tested? In ""hasty"", we tested T in position 4 and it was correct, but not in position 1.

Similarly, in ""batty"", T in position 3 and 4 was correct.

So no information about T in position 1.

Therefore, we must guess randomly.

But to decide: ""patty"" is more common than ""tatty""? 

Fatty and patty are both common, tatty is less common.

But it depends on context.

Since the game might use a common word, we can choose ""patty"".

Alternatively, we can think: we have one letter to test: the first letter. So if we guess ""patty"" and it's wrong, we lose. Same for ""fatty"" or ""tatty"".

So we have to take a risk.

Perhaps ""tatty"" is a possibility because we haven't ruled it out.

But let's see: if the secret word is ""tatty"", then when we guessed ""batty"", we would have:
- Position 1: B vs T → absent (x) which is correct.
- Position 2: A vs A → correct.
- Position 3: T vs T → correct.
- Position 4: T vs T → correct.
- Position 5: Y vs Y → correct.

But the feedback showed B(x) for position 1, which is consistent.

Similarly, for ""patty"" we would get P(x) or whatever.

There is no distinction from previous feedback.

Therefore, we must guess.

I think ""patty"" is a safe choice.

So we'll guess ""PATTY"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 5 (batty)**:
  - Positions:  
    - 1: B (absent)  
    - 2: A (correct)  
    - 3: T (correct)  
    - 4: T (correct)  
    - 5: Y (correct)  
- **New deductions**:  
  - The secret word has **A in position 2**, **T in both position 3 and 4**, and **Y in position 5**.  
  - Pattern: `? A T T Y` (first letter unknown).  
  - **B is absent** (adding to the absent list).

### Updated Constraint:
- **Fixed letters**: Position 2=A, 3=T, 4=T, 5=Y.  
- **First position**: Must be a letter not in the absent list (C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, M, L, B) and not fixed (A, T, Y).  
- **Available letters**: F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Possible words**: Only valid English words fitting `? A T T Y`.  
  - **Top candidates**:  
    1. **PATTY** (P + ATTY = ""a small flat cake"")  
    2. **FATTY** (F + ATTY = ""containing fat"")  
    3. **TATTY** (T + ATTY = ""tattered"")—less common but possible.  

- **Risk**: Only one guess remains (6th try). Must choose the most probable word.

### Decision:
- **Why PATTY?**  
  - ""Patty"" is a very common word (more frequent than ""tatty"").  
  - P is a high-frequency initial consonant.  
  - ""Fatty"" slightly overlaps semantically with ""batty"" (both informal adjectives).  
  - ""Tatty"" is less common; also, starting with T might be less likely given the secret word has two Ts already (though not prohibited).  
- High confidence in **PATTY** as the guess.

</think>
### Thought Process:
- **Current State**: After analyzing all feedback, the secret word must match the pattern `? A T T Y` (positions 2=A, 3=T, 4=T, 5=Y), with the first letter unknown.  
- **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, H, S, M, L, B (eliminated from previous guesses).  
- **Available Letters for Position 1**: F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Possible Words**:  
  - ""FATTY"", ""PATTY"", and ""TATTY"" are valid English candidates.  
  - ""TATTY"" (tattered) is less common; ""FATTY"" overlaps thematically with ""batty"" (informal); **""PATTY""** (a small cake) is highly frequent and fits common word criteria.  
- **Decision**:  
  - Choose **PATTY** to prioritize common usage and distinctiveness.  
  - Risk: If incorrect, no more guesses left, but ""PATTY"" has the highest likelihood among options.  
- **Conclusion**: ""PATTY"" is the optimal final guess given constraints and word frequency.
