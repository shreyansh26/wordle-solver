We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(-) E(x)

 Let's interpret the feedback:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R is in the word but not in position 2.
 - A is in the word but not in position 3.
 - N is in the word but not in position 4.
 - E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The first letter is C.
 - The word contains R, A, and N, but they are not in positions 2, 3, or 4 respectively.
 - E is absent.

 The secret word starts with C and has the letters R, A, N. But note: R is not in position 2, A not in 3, and N not in 4.

 Now, we must make a second guess. We need a 5-letter word that:
  1. Starts with C (since C is confirmed at position 1).
  2. Includes R, A, N (because they are present in the word).
  3. Does not include E (or any other letter we haven't seen that might be excluded? We don't have other exclusions yet).
  4. The positions: 
        R cannot be in position 2, 
        A cannot be in position 3, 
        N cannot be in position 4.

 Additionally, we must avoid putting R, A, N in the positions where they were marked as misplaced? We know:
 - R was in position 2 in ""crane"", but it's not in that position in the secret word -> so R must be in one of positions 3,4,5? But wait: it can't be in the same place? Actually, it can't be in position 2, and similarly A can't be in 3 and N can't be in 4.

 However, note that the word must have R, A, N somewhere else.

 Let's list the positions we have:
 Position 1: C (fixed)
 Position 2: cannot be R? Actually, the feedback for R says it is present but not in position 2. So R must be in position 3,4, or 5? Similarly, A must be in position 1? But wait: position 1 is fixed to C, so A must be in position 2,4, or 5? But we know from feedback that A is not in position 3? And note that A is not fixed to position 3? Actually, in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and we got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not that position.

 Similarly, N was in position 4 and is present but not there, so it must be in position 2,3, or 5? However, note: position 1 is taken by C.

 So constraints:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: Can be any letter except R? Also, it could be A or N? But we have to avoid E and we know E is absent.
  Position 3: Cannot be A (because A was misplaced there)? But it can be R or N? Also, note that R cannot be in position 2, and N cannot be in position 4.

 So let's try to form a word:

  We must have R, A, N in positions 2,3,4,5 but with constraints:
      R: not in 2 -> so in 3,4,5
      A: not in 3 -> so in 2,4,5
      N: not in 4 -> so in 2,3,5

 However, we also have to consider that the same letter might not be repeated? We don't know if the word has repeated letters, but in ""crane"" all letters are distinct. The feedback doesn't show any duplication, so let's assume for now that the secret word doesn't have duplicates? But note that it might. However, the feedback didn't mark any duplicate, but we don't have information.

 Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" tells us about each letter independently. Since there are no repeated letters in ""crane"", we don't know about duplicates in the secret. However, since we see that E is absent and other letters are present, we can only be sure about the distinct letters.

 We need to pick a word that starts with C and includes R, A, N. 

 We know:
   C at 1.
   We can try putting A in position 2? That would be valid because A can be in 2,4,5. Then we have to place R and N in 3,4,5? But:
        R must not be in 2 (which is already taken by A) -> okay.
        R must be in 3,4, or 5 -> okay.
        N must not be in 4 -> so we can put N in 3 or 5? But if we put N in 3, that's okay? Also, we have position 4 and 5.

 But note: we cannot put A in position 3 because that was the misplaced one? Actually, we can put A elsewhere.

 Alternatively, we might avoid putting R, A, N in the positions that are their original positions? Actually, the feedback only tells us that they are not in those specific positions. They might be in other positions.

 Let's brainstorm some words starting with C that contain R, A, N and not E.

 Possible words?
  We have to check: positions available: 2,3,4,5.

 Example: 
   ""carn?""? 
   But N can't be in position4? So if we try:
      C A R N ? -> But R in position3 (which is okay) and N in position4? But feedback says N cannot be in position4 -> so that's invalid.

   ""caRN"" is invalid because of N at 4? Then let me rearrange:

   Option 1: Put A in position2? Then:
        C A _ _ _
        Then we need R and N in positions 3,4,5? But R can be in 3,4,5 and N can be in 2? But position2 is taken, so N must be in 3,5? and note N cannot be in position4? So we cannot put N at 4? So:
        Possibilities:
          C A R N _ -> N at position4? invalid.
          C A R ? N -> R at 3, N at 5 -> okay? What word? CARIN? Not a word.
          C A N R _ -> N at position3? and then R at4? Then R at4: is that okay? Yes because R was blocked only from position2? Then we have C A N R ... -> CANRY? Not a word.

   Option 2: Put N in position2? Then we have C N ... 
        Constraints: N is allowed at position2? Yes, because the feedback only blocked N at position4? 
        Then we need to place A and R. A cannot be in position3? So A could be in position4 or5? R cannot be in position2 (which is taken) so R in 3,4,5.

        Possibilities:
          C N A R _ -> A at position3? But we have constraint: A cannot be in position3? -> invalid because of that.
          C N R A _ -> R at position3? and A at4? Then we have CNRA? like CRA? CRAZY? Only 5 letters. 
          Or C N R A ... -> word? ""cnrae"" not a word? 

   Option 3: Put R in a different place? For example, put R at position4? Then:
        We have C _ _ R _ 
        Then we need A and N? A cannot be in position3? So A can be in 2,5? N cannot be in position4? But position4 is R? So N can be in 2,3,5? 

        Example:
          Put A at position2: then C A _ R _ 
          Then we need N? We can put N at position3? Then C A N R _ -> CANR? But N at3 is allowed? And we have to fill position5? Letter must be ??? but we have no constraints except no E? CANRY -> not a word? 
          Or put N at position5: then we have C A _ R N -> CA_RN? What 5-letter words? CARIN? Not a word. Or CARUN? Not a word.

        Alternatively, put A at position5: then C _ _ R A 
        Then we need N? N must be in position2 or3? Because position4 is R? 
          If N at2: then C N _ R A -> what letter for position3? It must be a letter that is acceptable? And we need to check the word. Like C N R R A? Not distinct? Probably not a word. Or C N Y R A -> CNRYA? Not a word.

        So maybe put N in position3? Then C _ N R A -> 
          We need a letter for position2: it cannot be E? and must be a letter that fits.

        Example: ""corna""? C O R N A? But O isn't in the secret? We don't know about O? Actually, from first guess we only know E is excluded. But wait, we had other letters? In ""crane"", we had C,R,A,N,E. And E is excluded. But other letters (O) might be present? We don't have information on O.

        However, note: we must use R, A, N? Because we have feedback that R, A, N are in the word. So the word must include these.

        So every candidate word must include R, A, N and start with C.

 Let me think of common words:

   ""car""? -> then we need to complete 5 letters? Actually, 5-letter words.

   Words starting with C and having R, A, N: 
      ""cairn"" -> means a mound of stones? 
        Letters: C, A, I, R, N -> has R,A,N? Yes. And starts with C.
        Now positions:
          Position1: C (matches)
          Position2: A -> in the secret word? But secret has A and isn't in position3? But we don't know about position2? Also, in ""cairn"", 
          Position3: I -> unknown
          Position4: R -> R is in the word? And we know R isn't in position2? But R is in position4? That's allowed? Also, the secret has R? Yes.
          Position5: N -> N is in the word? And we know N isn't in position4? But this N is in position5 -> allowed.

        However, what about the A? A is in position2? But the constraint: in the first guess, A was in position3 and marked wrong, meaning that the secret has A but not in position3? So it could be in position2.

        So ""cairn"" is a valid candidate? Let's check against constraints:
          - First letter C: fixed -> okay.
          - Must contain R, A, N: yes.
          - R not in position2? Position2 is A -> okay. R is in position4? That's fine.
          - A not in position3? Here A is in position2? So not in 3 -> okay.
          - N not in position4? Here N is in position5 -> okay.

        Also, we are avoiding E? No E in ""cairn"" -> okay.

        So I could guess ""cairn"".

   Another candidate: ""crown""? But we don't know about O? And does it have A? No, it has O? Actually, we must have R, A, N? And ""crown"" has R,O,W,N? Missing A? So that's a problem.

   ""crane"" we already guessed? But we know E is absent? So we can't use E? So ""crane"" is invalid? Certainly we guessed it and got E missing? So we need a word without E.

   Another: ""caron""? Is that a word? Caron is a name? And it has A at position3? But we know that A is not in position3? So that's invalid? Because if we put A in position3, it would violate? Actually, let me spell: C A R O N? But then A at2? Then R at3? Then O, N? Then A is at2? Okay? But in this word ""caron"", A is at2? Actually:
        Position2: A -> allowed.
        Position3: R -> R is not in position2? So allowed? But wait: R was in position2 in the previous guess? In ""crane"", R was at position2? And we got '-' meaning it's in the word but not in position2. So in ""caron"", we have R at position3? So that's okay? 
        But we also have to include N? ""caron"" has C,A,R,O,N -> yes, has N? But we don't know about O? Also, N is at position5? -> okay.

        But note: we don't have any exclusion for O? So it might be. However, we must avoid E? That's okay? But is ""caron"" a valid English word? It might be a surname? So maybe not common? Let's avoid if we have a better candidate.

   ""cairn"" seems like a valid word? And it's accepted? Let's go with ""cairn"".

   However, let me think: we don't have information about the fourth letter? We have to test? 

   Alternatively, we can pick a word that includes all the known letters? And also tests new letters? Because we might have extra letters that aren't R,A,N? The secret word has 5 letters? We know starting with C, and having R,A,N? So the fifth letter must be something else? 

   In ""cairn"", the additional letter is 'I'. By using ""cairn"" we test the letter I?

   But note: in the first guess we had C,R,A,N,E? And we know E is absent, so we test I? That seems okay.

   Another candidate: ""crony""? But does it have A? No? It has O and Y? And no A? So that's invalid.

   Another candidate: ""coral""? Has O and L? But doesn't have R? Wait: ""coral"" has R? But doesn't have N? So missing N? Invalid.

   ""cramp""? Has M and P? Doesn't have N? Missing N? Invalid.

   So ""cairn"" seems a reasonable choice.

   Let's guess ""cairn"".

   We'll write: <guess>cairn</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R**, **A**, and **N** are present but misplaced (R not in position 2, A not in position 3, N not in position 4).
- **E** is absent (x).

The secret word must:
- Start with **C**.
- Contain **R**, **A**, and **N**, but not in their original positions from ""crane"".
- Exclude **E**.

A strong second guess should:
- Begin with **C**.
- Include **R**, **A**, and **N** while adhering to positional constraints.
- Introduce new vowels or consonants to test uncharted letters (like ""I"" here).

The word ""cairn"" fits perfectly:
- **C** (position 1) is confirmed ✓.
- **A** (position 2) avoids the forbidden position 3.
- **R** (position 4) avoids position 2.
- **N** (position 5) avoids position 4.
- Tests ""I"" (position 3) as a new letter.

<guess>cairn</guess>",cairn,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(-) E(x)

 Let's interpret the feedback:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R is in the word but not in position 2.
 - A is in the word but not in position 3.
 - N is in the word but not in position 4.
 - E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The first letter is C.
 - The word contains R, A, and N, but they are not in positions 2, 3, or 4 respectively.
 - E is absent.

 The secret word starts with C and has the letters R, A, N. But note: R is not in position 2, A not in 3, and N not in 4.

 Now, we must make a second guess. We need a 5-letter word that:
  1. Starts with C (since C is confirmed at position 1).
  2. Includes R, A, N (because they are present in the word).
  3. Does not include E (or any other letter we haven't seen that might be excluded? We don't have other exclusions yet).
  4. The positions: 
        R cannot be in position 2, 
        A cannot be in position 3, 
        N cannot be in position 4.

 Additionally, we must avoid putting R, A, N in the positions where they were marked as misplaced? We know:
 - R was in position 2 in ""crane"", but it's not in that position in the secret word -> so R must be in one of positions 3,4,5? But wait: it can't be in the same place? Actually, it can't be in position 2, and similarly A can't be in 3 and N can't be in 4.

 However, note that the word must have R, A, N somewhere else.

 Position 1: C (fixed)
 Position 2: cannot be R? Actually, the feedback for R says it is present but not in position 2. So R must be in position 3,4, or 5? Similarly, A must be in position 1?

Actually, in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and we got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not that position.

 Similarly, N was in position 4 and is present but not there, so it must be in position 2,3, or 5? However, note: position 1 is taken by C.

 So constraints:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: Can be any letter except R? Also, it could be A or N? But we have to avoid E and we know E is absent.
  Position 3: Cannot be A (because A was misplaced there)? But it can be R or N? Also, note that R cannot be in position 2, and N cannot be in position 4.

 So let's try to form a word:

  We must have R, A, N in positions 2,3,4,5 but with constraints:
      R: not in 2 -> so in 3,4,5
      A: not in 3 -> so in 2,4,5
      N: not in 4 -> so in 2,3,5

          C N R A _ -> R at position3? and A at4? Then we have CNRA? like CRA? CRAZY? Only 5 letters. 
          Or C N R A ... -> word? ""cnrae"" not a word? 

   Option 3: Put R in a different place? For example, put R at position4? Then:
        We have C _ _ R _ 
        Then we need A and N? A cannot be in position3? So A can be in 2,5? N cannot be in position4? But position4 is R? So N can be in 2,3,5? 

        Example:
          Put A at position2: then C A _ R _ 
          Then we need N? We can put N at position3? Then C A N R _ -> CANR? But N at3 is allowed? And we have to fill position5? Letter must be ??? but we have no constraints except no E? CANRY -> not a word? 
          Or put N at position5: then we have C A _ R N -> CA_RN? What 5-letter words? CARIN? Not a word. Or CARUN? Not a word.

        Alternatively, put A at position5: then C _ _ R A 
        Then we need N? N must be in position2 or3? Because position4 is R? 
          If N at2: then C N _ R A -> what letter for position3? It must be a letter that is acceptable? And we need to check the word. Like C N R R A? Not distinct? Probably not a word. Or C N Y R A -> CNRYA? Not a word.

        So maybe put N in position3? Then C _ N R A -> 
          We need a letter for position2: it cannot be E? and must be a letter that fits.

        Example: ""corna""? C O R N A? But O isn't in the secret? We don't know about O? Actually, from first guess we only know E is excluded. But wait, we had other letters? In ""crane"", we had C,R,A,N,E. And E is excluded. But other letters (O) might be present? We don't have information on O.

        However, note: we must use R, A, N? Because we have feedback that R, A, N are in the word. So the word must include these.

        So every candidate word must include R, A, N and start with C.

 Let me think of common words:

   ""car""? -> then we need to complete 5 letters? Actually, 5-letter words.

   Words starting with C and having R, A, N: 
      ""cairn"" -> means a mound of stones? 
        Letters: C, A, I, R, N -> has R,A,N? Yes. And starts with C.
        Now positions:
          Position1: C (matches)
          Position2: A -> in the secret word? But secret has A and isn't in position3? But we don't know about position2? Also, in ""cairn"", 
          Position3: I -> unknown
          Position4: R -> R is in the word? And we know R isn't in position2? But R is in position4? That's allowed? Also, the secret has R? Yes.
          Position5: N -> N is in the word? And we know N isn't in position4? But this N is in position5 -> allowed.

        However, what about the A? A is in position2? But the constraint: in the first guess, A was in position3 and marked wrong, meaning that the secret has A but not in position3? So it could be in position2.

        So ""cairn"" is a valid candidate? Let's check against constraints:
          - First letter C: fixed -> okay.
          - Must contain R, A, N: yes.
          - R not in position2? Position2 is A -> okay. R is in position4? That's fine.
          - A not in position3? Here A is in position2? So not in 3 -> okay.
          - N not in position4? Here N is in position5 -> okay.

        Also, we are avoiding E? No E in ""cairn"" -> okay.

        So I could guess ""cairn"".

   Another candidate: ""crown""? But we don't know about O? And does it have A? No, it has O? Actually, we must have R, A, N? And ""crown"" has R,O,W,N? Missing A? So that's a problem.

   ""crane"" we already guessed? But we know E is absent? So we can't use E? So ""crane"" is invalid? Certainly we guessed it and got E missing? So we need a word without E.

   Another: ""caron""? Is that a word? Caron is a name? And it has A at position3? But we know that A is not in position3? So that's invalid? Because if we put A in position3, it would violate? Actually, let me spell: C A R O N? But then A at2? Then R at3? Then O, N? Then A is at2? Okay? But in this word ""caron"", A is at2? Actually:
        Position2: A -> allowed.
        Position3: R -> R is not in position2? So allowed? But wait: R was in position2 in the previous guess? In ""crane"", R was at position2? And we got '-' meaning it's in the word but not in position2. So in ""caron"", we have R at position3? So that's okay? 
        But we also have to include N? ""caron"" has C,A,R,O,N -> yes, has N? But we don't know about O? Also, N is at position5? -> okay.

        But note: we don't have any exclusion for O? So it might be. However, we must avoid E? That's okay? But is ""caron"" a valid English word? It might be a surname? So maybe not common? Let's avoid if we have a better candidate.

   ""cairn"" seems like a valid word? And it's accepted? Let's go with ""cairn"".

   However, let me think: we don't have information about the fourth letter? We have to test? 

   Alternatively, we can pick a word that includes all the known letters? And also tests new letters? Because we might have extra letters that aren't R,A,N? The secret word has 5 letters? We know starting with C, and having R,A,N? So the fifth letter must be something else? 

   In ""cairn"", the additional letter is 'I'. By using ""cairn"" we test the letter I?

   But note: in the first guess we had C,R,A,N,E? And we know E is absent, so we test I? That seems okay.

   Another candidate: ""crony""? But does it have A? No? It has O and Y? And no A? So that's invalid.

   Another candidate: ""coral""? Has O and L? But doesn't have R? Wait: ""coral"" has R? But doesn't have N? So missing N? Invalid.

   ""cramp""? Has M and P? Doesn't have N? Missing N? Invalid.

   So ""cairn"" seems a reasonable choice.

   Let's guess ""cairn"".

   We'll write: <guess>cairn</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R**, **A**, and **N** are present but misplaced (R not in position 2, A not in position 3, N not in position 4).
- **E** is absent (x).

The secret word must:
- Start with **C**.
- Contain **R**, **A**, and **N**, but not in their original positions from ""crane"".
- Exclude **E**.

A strong second guess should:
- Begin with **C**.
- Include **R**, **A**, and **N** while adhering to positional constraints.
- Introduce new vowels or consonants to test uncharted letters (like ""I"" here).

The word ""cairn"" fits perfectly:
- **C** (position 1) is confirmed ✓.
- **A** (position 2) avoids the forbidden position 3.
- **R** (position 4) avoids position 2.
- **N** (position 5) avoids position 4.
- Tests ""I"" (position 3) as a new letter.",Guess 2: cairn -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
