We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
  C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
  R(✓) -> R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  A(✓) -> A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
  N(-) -> N is in the word but not in position 4.
  E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

So we know:
  The secret word has 5 letters: _ R A _ _
  The letter R is in position 2 and A is in position 3.
  The secret word contains the letter N, but not in position 4. Therefore, N must be in one of the other positions: 1, 3, or 5? But note:
    - Position 3 is already taken by A (so N cannot be at position 3).
    - Therefore, N must be in position 1 or position 5? But wait, we have position 1 and 5 available? Actually, positions 1, 4, and 5 are open? Let me clarify:

The word is: [1] [2=R] [3=A] [4] [5]

We know N is in the word but not in position 4. Since position 3 is A (so taken), that leaves positions 1, 4, and 5? Wait, position 4 was the position we guessed for N and it was marked as '-', meaning it's present but not at position 4. So N must be at one of the positions: 1, 5? Because position 2 and 3 are taken by R and A.

But note: the secret word might have duplicate letters? However, we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

Also, we know that C and E are absent.

So the secret word pattern: 
  Position 1: not C, and not E? Actually, we only know that C and E are absent, so any letter except C and E? But we don't know if other letters could be duplicated.

The known constraints:
  Position 2: R
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: cannot be N? But also, we don't know what it is? And position 4 must be a letter that is not N? Actually, no: we know that N is in the word but not at position 4, so position 4 is some other letter.

We also know that N must be at either position 1 or 5? Because positions 2 and 3 are taken? Unless the word has two A's or two R's? But we don't have any duplicate hints.

Moreover, the word does not contain C or E.

Our goal is to choose a word that fits the constraints and will help us narrow down.

We have:
  Word has R at 2, A at 3, and contains N (but not at 4).
  So possible pattern: 
    [1] = ? (could be N? or another letter? but N must be either at 1 or 5? because 4 is the only other? Actually, we have two positions: 1 and 5? And position 4 is a different letter? But note: N must appear somewhere else? 

But wait: positions 4 and 5 are available? And position 1 is also available? So N can be at position 1, 5? Or what about position 4? We already know it's not at position 4? So yes, only position 1 or 5.

Now, let's think of possible words:

We need a word that:
  - Has R at position 2, A at position 3.
  - Contains the letter N (at position 1 or 5? And the remaining position must be the other letter?).
  - Does not contain C or E.

But note: we must also avoid letters we haven't guessed yet? And we want to test other common letters? 

Since we know two positions and one letter that must be present (N) but in a different spot, we can use our next guess to test:

  Option 1: Try putting N at position 1? Then we need a letter for 4 and 5? 
  Option 2: Try putting N at position 5? Then positions 1 and 4 need to be filled.

Also, we want to include other common consonants to get more information? Because if we guess only one pattern, we might not get enough hints? Especially like T, S, L, etc.

But note: we were told that we have 6 tries? So we must be efficient.

Possible words that fit the pattern:

Pattern: [letter1] R A [letter4] [letter5]? 
Constraints: 
  letter4 ≠ N because we know from first feedback that N is not at position 4? Actually, the feedback for the fourth letter (N) was '-' meaning it is present but not at that position? So position 4 must not be N? But it could be another letter? And we require that the word includes N at position 1 or 5.

But also, we don't know what letter4 is? Only that it isn't N? And we haven't tested any other letters? 

So we can try to make a guess that has:
  Position 1: We can put a new letter? Or N? 
  Position 4: a new letter? 
  Position 5: a new letter? 

But we know we must include N in either position 1 or position 5? Because we don't have it elsewhere? So if we guess a word without N, that would be invalid? Because we know N is in the word? So we must include N at either position 1 or position 5.

Therefore, let's consider including N in the guess? But also, we want to test other letters? So we can try:

Case 1: Put N at position 1? Then we have ""N R A [?] [?]"" and the last two letters are unknown? Then we can try common letters for those positions? But we cannot use C or E? 

Case 2: Put N at position 5? Then we have ""? R A ? N""

But note: we are also restricted because the secret word might not have N at position 1? And if we choose the wrong one? Then we lose a guess? So alternatively, we can try a word that includes N at position 5? And include other common letters? Or vice versa? 

We can also use a word that includes many new letters? 

Let me brainstorm some words:

With pattern: [1]R A [4][5]? 

Example words ending with N? 
  ""CRAZ?N"" -> but C is eliminated? So not? 
  ""BRAIN"" -> B at position 1, R (fixed), A (fixed), I at 4, N at 5? And I and N? 
  But note: we must avoid C and E? So ""BRAIN"" is a candidate? Let's check:

If the secret word is ""BRAIN"", then:
  B is at 1? -> we don't know? 
  I is at 4? -> we don't know? 
  N is at 5? -> which is acceptable? 

But we want to test multiple new letters? 

We can also consider ""TRAD"" ... wait, letters? 

Another candidate: ""TRAIN"": 
  T at 1? 
  R at 2? 
  A at 3? 
  I at 4? 
  N at 5? 

This word fits: 
  It has R at 2, A at 3? 
  And N at 5? Which we must include? And T and I are new letters? 

But what about the feedback? We might get enough information? 

Also, ""TRAIN"" doesn't contain C or E? So it's valid? 

Another candidate: ""CRANE"" was already used? And we know C and E are absent? 

Another candidate: ""GRAIN"" -> G at 1, R, A, I, N? 

But let's pick ""TRAIN"" because T is a very common letter? And the word ""TRAIN"" is common? 

Alternatively, we could pick ""PLANT""? but with N and P? 
But the pattern: position 1: P? position 2: R? position 3: A? Then position 4: N? -> wait, but we know that N cannot be at position 4? So ""PLANT"" has N at position 4? Therefore, it cannot be the word? Because we know N is not at position 4? So we must avoid that? 

Similarly, we must not put N at position 4? So any word with N at 4 is invalid? 

Therefore, ""TRAIN"": 
  Positions: T at 1, R at 2, A at 3, I at 4, N at 5? 

So let's go with ""TRAIN""? 

But what if we are wrong? Then we get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can test multiple possibilities? 

But note: we are allowed only 5 more guesses? So we can try TRAIN? 

Another candidate: ""BRAND"" -> but D? We haven't tested? But note: we must avoid E? 
  B at 1, R, A, N at 4? -> but wait! N at position 4? That's not allowed? Because first feedback said N not at 4? So we cannot guess BRAND? 

Similarly, we must avoid putting N at position 4? 

Therefore, TRAIN is a good candidate? 

But wait: in TRAIN, position 4 is I? Which we haven't tested? 

Another candidate: ""GRAND"" -> has N at position 4? -> not allowed? 

""ORGAN"" -> O? 
  Positions: O at 1, R at 2, A at 3, G at 4, N at 5? -> does not put N at 4? So that's allowed? 

But we have multiple choices? We can use TRAIN? 

I think TRAIN is a good second guess? 

But let me double check? 

We know: 
  - The secret word contains the letters R, A, N? And two more letters? 
  - The two more letters must be in positions 1, 4, and 5? But note: we have three positions? But actually, we are filling three positions? Because positions 2 and 3 are fixed? 

In TRAIN, we guess:
  Position 1: T -> if it's correct? we'll know? 
  Position 4: I -> and position 5: N? 

If the secret word has N at position 5? Then we get a match? 

But if the secret word does not have T? Or does not have I? 

We can get feedback? 

So let's go with ""TRAIN""

Therefore, our second guess: TRAIN? 

But note: we should write it? But let's see if it fits? 

Pattern: T R A I N? 

We are testing T and I? And placing N at the end? 

If the secret word is ""BRAIN"", then we would get? 
  T: not present? -> x
  R: present and correct? ✓
  A: present and correct? ✓
  I: present and correct? ✓? 
  N: present and correct? ✓? 

But also, if the secret word is ""BRAIN"", then:
  Position1: should be B? 
  Position4: should be I? 
  Position5: should be N? 

So if the secret word is ""BRAIN"", then for TRAIN we get:
  T: not in the word? -> x? 
  R: correct? ✓
  A: correct? ✓
  I: correct? ✓? Because in BRAIN? position 4? 
  N: correct? ✓? 

Then the feedback would be: T(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(✓)? 

Then we would know that the word is something that has R, A, I, N and an unknown letter at position 1? That starts with any letter? 

But wait: we don't have the letter at position 1? 

Alternatively, if the secret word is ""TRAIN"", then we get all ✓.

So yes? 

Another possibility: the secret word might have N at position 1? Then the word is something like ""NRA??"". 

But we are not going to guess ""NRA??"", because we don't know? 

So TRAIN is safe? 

Therefore, I will guess ""TRAIN""
</think>
Based on the feedback from ""crane"":  
- C and E are absent.  
- R is at position 2 and A at position 3 (correct and in place).  
- N is present but not in position 4, so it must be at position 1 or 5.

For the next guess, I need to:  
1. Include R in position 2 and A in position 3.  
2. Include N at position 1 or 5 (to test its placement).  
3. Avoid C and E entirely.  
4. Test new common letters like T, I, L, etc.

""TRAIN"" fits these criteria:  
- Position 1: T (new letter to test).  
- Position 2: R (fixed).  
- Position 3: A (fixed).  
- Position 4: I (new letter to test).  
- Position 5: N (testing the possibility that N is at the end).  

If the secret word is ""BRAIN"", for example, ""TRAIN"" will help identify if B or other letters are present via feedback.

**Reasoning summary**:  
- TESTING N's placement: By guessing ""TRAIN"", I place N at position 5. Based on feedback, I'll confirm if N is correct at 5 or if it’s actually at position 1.  
- MAXIMIZING INFORMATION: T and I are high-frequency letters; feedback on them will quickly narrow options.  
- AVOIDING DUPLICATES/ABSENTS: Skipping C and E, and ensuring no invalid letters are reused.

<guess>train</guess>",train,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
  C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
  R(✓) -> R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  A(✓) -> A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
  N(-) -> N is in the word but not in position 4.
  E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

So we know:
  The secret word has 5 letters: _ R A _ _
  The letter R is in position 2 and A is in position 3.
  The secret word contains the letter N, but not in position 4. Therefore, N must be in one of the other positions: 1, 3, or 5? But note:
    - Position 3 is already taken by A (so N cannot be at position 3).
    - Therefore, N must be in position 1 or position 5? But wait, we have position 1 and 5 available? Actually, positions 1, 4, and 5 are open? Let me clarify:

The word is: [1] [2=R] [3=A] [4] [5]

We know N is in the word but not in position 4. Since position 3 is A (so taken), that leaves positions 1, 4, and 5? Wait, position 4 was the position we guessed for N and it was marked as '-', meaning it's present but not at position 4. So N must be at one of the positions: 1, 5? Because position 2 and 3 are taken by R and A.

But note: the secret word might have duplicate letters? However, we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

Also, we know that C and E are absent.

So the secret word pattern: 
  Position 1: not C, and not E? Actually, we only know that C and E are absent, so any letter except C and E? But we don't know if other letters could be duplicated.

The known constraints:
  Position 2: R
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: cannot be N? But also, we don't know what it is? And position 4 must be a letter that is not N? Actually, no: we know that N is in the word but not at position 4, so position 4 is some other letter.

We also know that N must be at either position 1 or 5? Because positions 2 and 3 are taken? Unless the word has two A's or two R's? But we don't have any duplicate hints.

Moreover, the word does not contain C or E.

Our goal is to choose a word that fits the constraints and will help us narrow down.

We have:

  So possible pattern: 
    [1] = ? (could be N? or another letter? but N must be either at 1 or 5? because 4 is the only other? Actually, we have two positions: 1 and 5? And position 4 is a different letter? But note: N must appear somewhere else? 

But wait: positions 4 and 5 are available? And position 1 is also available? So N can be at position 1, 5? Or what about position 4? We already know it's not at position 4? So yes, only position 1 or 5.

Now, let's think of possible words:

We need a word that:
  - Has R at position 2, A at position 3.
  - Contains the letter N (at position 1 or 5? And the remaining position must be the other letter?).
  - Does not contain C or E.

But note: we must also avoid letters we haven't guessed yet? And we want to test other common letters? 

Since we know two positions and one letter that must be present (N) but in a different spot, we can use our next guess to test:

  Option 1: Try putting N at position 1? Then we need a letter for 4 and 5? 
  Option 2: Try putting N at position 5? Then positions 1 and 4 need to be filled.

Also, we want to include other common consonants to get more information? Because if we guess only one pattern, we might not get enough hints? Especially like T, S, L, etc.

But note: we were told that we have 6 tries? So we must be efficient.

Possible words that fit the pattern:

Pattern: [letter1] R A [letter4] [letter5]? 
Constraints: 
  letter4 ≠ N because we know from first feedback that N is not at position 4? Actually, the feedback for the fourth letter (N) was '-' meaning it is present but not at that position? So position 4 must not be N? But it could be another letter? And we require that the word includes N at position 1 or 5.

But also, we don't know what letter4 is? Only that it isn't N? And we haven't tested any other letters? 

So we can try to make a guess that has:
  Position 1: We can put a new letter? Or N? 
  Position 4: a new letter? 
  Position 5: a new letter? 

But we know we must include N in either position 1 or position 5? Because we don't have it elsewhere? So if we guess a word without N, that would be invalid? Because we know N is in the word? So we must include N at either position 1 or position 5.

Therefore, let's consider including N in the guess? But also, we want to test other letters? So we can try:

Case 1: Put N at position 1? Then we have ""N R A [?] [?]"" and the last two letters are unknown? Then we can try common letters for those positions? But we cannot use C or E? 

Case 2: Put N at position 5? Then we have ""? R A ? N""

But note: we are also restricted because the secret word might not have N at position 1? And if we choose the wrong one? Then we lose a guess? So alternatively, we can try a word that includes N at position 5? And include other common letters? Or vice versa? 

We can also use a word that includes many new letters? 

Let me brainstorm some words:

With pattern: [1]R A [4][5]? 

Example words ending with N? 
  ""CRAZ?N"" -> but C is eliminated? So not? 
  ""BRAIN"" -> B at position 1, R (fixed), A (fixed), I at 4, N at 5? And I and N? 
  But note: we must avoid C and E? So ""BRAIN"" is a candidate? Let's check:

If the secret word is ""BRAIN"", then:
  B is at 1? -> we don't know? 
  I is at 4? -> we don't know? 
  N is at 5? -> which is acceptable? 

But we want to test multiple new letters? 

We can also consider ""TRAD"" ... wait, letters? 

Another candidate: ""TRAIN"": 
  T at 1? 
  R at 2? 
  A at 3? 
  I at 4? 
  N at 5? 

This word fits: 
  It has R at 2, A at 3? 
  And N at 5? Which we must include? And T and I are new letters? 

But what about the feedback? We might get enough information? 

Also, ""TRAIN"" doesn't contain C or E? So it's valid? 

Another candidate: ""CRANE"" was already used? And we know C and E are absent? 

Another candidate: ""GRAIN"" -> G at 1, R, A, I, N? 

But let's pick ""TRAIN"" because T is a very common letter? And the word ""TRAIN"" is common? 

Alternatively, we could pick ""PLANT""? but with N and P? 
But the pattern: position 1: P? position 2: R? position 3: A? Then position 4: N? -> wait, but we know that N cannot be at position 4? So ""PLANT"" has N at position 4? Therefore, it cannot be the word? Because we know N is not at position 4? So we must avoid that? 

Similarly, we must not put N at position 4? So any word with N at 4 is invalid? 

Therefore, ""TRAIN"": 
  Positions: T at 1, R at 2, A at 3, I at 4, N at 5? 

So let's go with ""TRAIN""? 

But what if we are wrong? Then we get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can test multiple possibilities? 

But note: we are allowed only 5 more guesses? So we can try TRAIN? 

Another candidate: ""BRAND"" -> but D? We haven't tested? But note: we must avoid E? 
  B at 1, R, A, N at 4? -> but wait! N at position 4? That's not allowed? Because first feedback said N not at 4? So we cannot guess BRAND? 

Similarly, we must avoid putting N at position 4? 

Therefore, TRAIN is a good candidate? 

But wait: in TRAIN, position 4 is I? Which we haven't tested? 

Another candidate: ""GRAND"" -> has N at position 4? -> not allowed? 

""ORGAN"" -> O? 
  Positions: O at 1, R at 2, A at 3, G at 4, N at 5? -> does not put N at 4? So that's allowed? 

But we have multiple choices? We can use TRAIN? 

I think TRAIN is a good second guess? 

But let me double check? 

We know: 
  - The secret word contains the letters R, A, N? And two more letters? 
  - The two more letters must be in positions 1, 4, and 5? But note: we have three positions? But actually, we are filling three positions? Because positions 2 and 3 are fixed? 

In TRAIN, we guess:
  Position 1: T -> if it's correct? we'll know? 
  Position 4: I -> and position 5: N? 

If the secret word has N at position 5? Then we get a match? 

But if the secret word does not have T? Or does not have I? 

We can get feedback? 

So let's go with ""TRAIN""

Therefore, our second guess: TRAIN? 

But note: we should write it? But let's see if it fits? 

Pattern: T R A I N? 

We are testing T and I? And placing N at the end? 

If the secret word is ""BRAIN"", then we would get? 
  T: not present? -> x
  R: present and correct? ✓
  A: present and correct? ✓
  I: present and correct? ✓? 
  N: present and correct? ✓? 

But also, if the secret word is ""BRAIN"", then:
  Position1: should be B? 
  Position4: should be I? 
  Position5: should be N? 

So if the secret word is ""BRAIN"", then for TRAIN we get:
  T: not in the word? -> x? 
  R: correct? ✓
  A: correct? ✓
  I: correct? ✓? Because in BRAIN? position 4? 
  N: correct? ✓? 

Then the feedback would be: T(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(✓)? 

Then we would know that the word is something that has R, A, I, N and an unknown letter at position 1? That starts with any letter? 

But wait: we don't have the letter at position 1? 

Alternatively, if the secret word is ""TRAIN"", then we get all ✓.

So yes? 

Another possibility: the secret word might have N at position 1? Then the word is something like ""NRA??"". 

But we are not going to guess ""NRA??"", because we don't know? 

So TRAIN is safe? 

Therefore, I will guess ""TRAIN""Based on the feedback from ""crane"":  
- C and E are absent.  
- R is at position 2 and A at position 3 (correct and in place).  
- N is present but not in position 4, so it must be at position 1 or 5.

For the next guess, I need to:  
1. Include R in position 2 and A in position 3.  
2. Include N at position 1 or 5 (to test its placement).  
3. Avoid C and E entirely.  
4. Test new common letters like T, I, L, etc.

""TRAIN"" fits these criteria:  
- Position 1: T (new letter to test).  
- Position 2: R (fixed).  
- Position 3: A (fixed).  
- Position 4: I (new letter to test).  
- Position 5: N (testing the possibility that N is at the end).  

If the secret word is ""BRAIN"", for example, ""TRAIN"" will help identify if B or other letters are present via feedback.

**Reasoning summary**:  
- TESTING N's placement: By guessing ""TRAIN"", I place N at position 5. Based on feedback, I'll confirm if N is correct at 5 or if it’s actually at position 1.  
- MAXIMIZING INFORMATION: T and I are high-frequency letters; feedback on them will quickly narrow options.  
- AVOIDING DUPLICATES/ABSENTS: Skipping C and E, and ensuring no invalid letters are reused.",Guess 2: train -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
