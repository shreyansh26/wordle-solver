 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have excluded 5: C, R, A, N, E.

 Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
 Remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are excluded)

 We should try to include some of the most common consonants and at least one vowel.

 Common consonants in English: S, T, L, M, D, etc.
 Common vowels: O, I, U.

 A good candidate might be ""SPLIT"" but it has an 'I' and common consonants.

 However, note that we have to avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's consider other starting words that avoid these letters.

 Some options:
 - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> all allowed.
 - ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> allowed.
 - ""GHOUL"": G, H, O, U, L -> allowed, but less common.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SLIPT"" but that is not a common word. We need a valid English word.

 Another idea: ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T -> but N is excluded! We cannot use N because it was in the first guess and marked as absent.

 So we must avoid N.

 Let's try to form a word with the remaining letters.

 How about ""MOUTH"": M, O, U, T, H -> all allowed? 
 Check: M, O, U, T, H are not in the excluded list (C,R,A,N,E). So yes.

 Another common word: ""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T -> allowed.

 But note: we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me list some words without C,R,A,N,E:
 - ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S -> allowed.
 - ""DUMPY"": D, U, M, P, Y -> allowed.

 However, we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

 Another good one: ""SHIFT"": S, H, I, F, T -> allowed.

 But note: we don't know if any of these are in the word, but we have to try.

 I think ""MOUTH"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants (M, T, H).

 Alternatively, ""SLIMY"": S, L, I, M, Y -> allowed.

 However, I recall that in Wordle, it's often good to use words with common letters to get maximum information.

 Let me choose ""MOUTH"" for the next guess.

 But wait, we have to consider that we have 5 new letters: M, O, U, T, H.

 Alternatively, we can use ""PIOUS"" to get P, I, O, U, S.

 I think ""PIOUS"" might be better because it has S and P which are common.

 However, let's look for a word that includes S and T, which are very common.

 The word ""MOIST"" is a classic, but we cannot use it because it has the letter 'S', 'T', and also 'I' and 'O'. But wait, we can use it because none of M, O, I, S, T are excluded? 
 Check: M is not excluded? Yes, because we only excluded C,R,A,N,E.

 So ""MOIST"" is allowed: M, O, I, S, T.

 That seems like a good choice because it has two vowels (O, I) and three common consonants (M, S, T).

 Therefore, I will guess ""moist"".

 But note: we must ensure it's a valid word. Yes, ""moist"" is a valid English word.

 So, next guess: ""moist""

<guess>moist</guess>
</think>
After the first guess ""crane"" received all 'x' feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a 5-letter English word that avoids these letters entirely to test new letters.

Aim for a word with common consonants (like S, T, L, M) and vowels (I, O, U) to maximize information. ""Moist"" fits well:
- Uses new letters: M, O, I, S, T
- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- Tests multiple high-frequency letters in different positions

This guess will provide feedback on whether any of M, O, I, S, or T are in the secret word and their positions.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"": all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word)
2. ""moist"": 
   - M(x): absent
   - O(x): absent
   - I(✓): present and in the correct position (third letter)
   - S(✓): present and in the correct position (fourth letter)
   - T(x): absent

So, we know:
- The secret word has 'I' in the third position and 'S' in the fourth position.
- Therefore, the word pattern is: _ _ I S _ 
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits:
- Third letter: I
- Fourth letter: S
- Avoids letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T

Possible letters for the remaining positions: 
Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Available vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are either excluded or already used? Note: I is used but only in position 3, so we can have other vowels elsewhere)

However, note that I is already in position 3, but it could potentially appear again? The feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicate letters unless we guess. But in the feedback for ""moist"", we only got one I marked correct, so if there were another I, it might have been shown? Actually, the rules don't specify how duplicates are handled, but typically:
- If a letter appears only once in the secret word, and you guess two, one might show as absent? But this game uses symbols: ✓, -, x.

Looking back at the rules: each letter is marked independently. So for the secret word ""BRISK"", if you guessed ""STORM"", the first S is marked with '-' (present but wrong position) and the second S? Actually, in the example, there was no duplicate.

But in our case, the word ""moist"" had one I and one S, both marked correctly in position. There was no duplicate in our guess. Since we don't have duplicate letters in our guess, we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters.

So, we must consider that the secret word could have duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any indication so far.

However, note that in position 3 and 4 we have I and S fixed. So the word pattern: _ _ I S _

Now, we need to choose a word that:
- Starts with two letters and ends with one letter from the available set: avoiding C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T.
- These letters must include: for the first, second, and fifth positions.

Available letters: 
Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
Vowels: U (and sometimes Y)

We should try to cover more common letters to get information.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ _ I S _ 

Common words:
- DAISY? But contains A (excluded) and Y is allowed? However, A is in the exclusion list (from guess1: A(x)).
- FOCUS? Contains O and C (both excluded).
- LYSIS? Not common and has Y and S again? But S is already in the fourth, we can have another S? But let's see.

We need valid common words.

Consider:
- ""QUIZS""? No, not valid and must be 5 letters without S at the end? The pattern is _ _ I S _, so last letter is unknown.

Better examples:
- ""GUISE"": But E is excluded? And contains E -> not allowed.
- ""BLISS"": Contains B, L, I, S, S. Pattern: B L I S S -> _ _ I S _. But we have a duplicate S? And third letter I and fourth S are correct? However, we must avoid excluded letters. Does it contain excluded? B,L,I,S,S -> I and S are allowed, but B and L are new. However, E? No. But wait, our exclusion list: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T -> so B, L are allowed.
  But ""BLISS"" ends with two S's? The fifth letter would be S. So pattern: BLISS -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:I, 4:S, 5:S -> so fifth letter is S.

But note: in the feedback we already have S in the fourth as correct, but the fifth could be another S? It's possible.

However, we don't know if the secret word has duplicate S. But by the feedback rules, if the secret has one S and we guess a word with two S, one would be correct (if in right position) and the other might be marked as absent? Or depending on the rules.

But we haven't seen that scenario yet. So let's not guess duplicates until we have information.

Alternate words:
- ""SPLIS""? Not a word.
- ""WHISK"": W,H,I,S,K -> pattern: W H I S K -> matches? Positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:S, 5:K.
  Check letters: W, H, I, S, K.
  Excluded letters? W: new? Not in excluded list. H: new. K: new. And avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T -> yes.

But is ""WHISK"" valid? Yes, meaning a kitchen utensil.

We could use ""WHISK"" as our next guess.

Another common word: ""FLASK""? Contains A and L? Excluded? A is excluded from guess1. So ""FLASK"" has A -> not allowed.

Another: ""THUSK""? Not a word.

""BRISK"": B,R,I,S,K -> but R is excluded? From guess1: R(x) so R is not in the word. So cannot use R.

""DISKS"": D,I,S,K,S -> pattern: D I S K S -> wait, third letter would be S? But we need I in third and S in fourth? This word has I in second? Doesn't match.

Let's list words ending with IS_? 

We need:

- Position 1: a letter from available set
- Position 2: a letter from available set
- Position 5: a letter from available set

Words: 
- Can we have ""BLIPS""? B,L,I,P,S -> but the fourth letter would be P? then fifth S -> but we need S in fourth? So pattern is _ _ I S _, so BLIPS has fourth letter P? No.

Pattern: 1st: _, 2nd: _, 3rd: I, 4th: S, 5th: _

So:
- Position 1: letter1
- Position 2: letter2
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: letter5

So the word is: L1 L2 I S L5

Now, with L1, L2, L5 not being C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T.

And L1, L2, L5 must form a word.

Possible L5: we can use most letters.

Common words:
- ""GUISE"" -> but has E -> excluded.
- ""POISE"" -> has P,O,I,S,E -> O and E excluded.
- ""QUIPS"" -> Q,U,I,P,S -> pattern: Q U I P S -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:P -> wait, fourth is P? But we need S in fourth? No, this has I in third but fourth is P, then fifth S? So it would be QUI? Then P in fourth? But we need S in fourth. So not matching.

Actually, ""QUIPS"": Q-U-I-P-S -> 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S -> so fourth is P, not S. So doesn't match pattern.

We need the fourth letter to be S.

Another word: ""BASIS""? Contains B,A,I,S,S -> A excluded? Yes, A is in exclusion list.

""RADIS""? Not a word and contains A,R.

""DAILY""? Contains A -> excluded.

""JUMPS""? Contains M -> M was absent in guess2? So M is excluded? M(x) from moist? Yes.

So avoid M.

List of excluded letters now: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And vowels: U, and sometimes Y.

Words fitting _ _ I S _ :
Possible words:
- ""BLISS"": B,L,I,S,S -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:I, 4:S, 5:S -> ends with S. But S is repeated? However, L2 is L, which is allowed. Also, we test B and L. But fifth letter S is already known? But we don't know the fifth letter is S? So if we guess it, and it's wrong, we get information.

But we can do better: choose a word with completely new letters.

Other words:
- ""WHISK"": W,H,I,S,K -> W, H, K are new letters. This seems good.
- ""FRISK""? F,R? R is excluded (from guess1) -> cannot use.

- ""DISKS""? D,I,S,K,S -> but the fourth letter would be K? Then fifth S? Pattern: D I S K S -> so 1:D, 2:I, 3:S? But we need third to be I? No, in this word the third letter is S? Doesn't fit.

We need third letter I and fourth S.

- ""SKIPS""? S,K,I,P,S -> pattern: S K I P S -> positions: 1:S (which we know is not in the word? Wait, no: we know S is present and in fourth position. But does that mean it can't be elsewhere? Actually, in the secret word, S is at position four, but it might be elsewhere too? The feedback doesn't forbid that.

In feedback for ""moist"":
- S(✓) at position four: meaning S is at position four and correct. It doesn't say anything about other positions? But the symbol is only for the position guessed.

Yes, it's possible that S appears again in the word? But in our guess, we only have one S? So we don't know.

However, if we guess a word with two S, one at the correct fourth position and one elsewhere, then the other S would be marked as absent? Or if the secret word has two S, it would be marked as present? Let me check the rules.

The feedback symbols:
- ✓: letter in word and in correct position.
- - : letter in word but in wrong position.
- x: letter not in word.

If the secret word has two S's, and you guess a word with one S at the correct fourth position and another S elsewhere, then:
- The S in the fourth position would be ✓.
- The other S? 
  - If the secret word has a second S, then it would be marked as '-' if not in the same position? Or '✓' if by chance? But we placed it in a different position? So it would be marked '-' for wrong position?
  - But note: we don't know if there's a duplicate.

However, in our case, for ""moist"", we guessed only one S and it was correctly placed. But the secret word could still have another S? How? If the secret word was ""SISSY"", then in guess ""moist"", the fourth letter S is correct? But the secret word has S at positions 1 and 2 and 3 and 4? Then if we guess ""moist"" which has S in position 4 only, it would show S(✓) for the fourth? And if the secret word has other S's, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess them.

So duplicates are possible? But we haven't ruled them out.

But for now, let's avoid duplicates unless necessary.

Back to words: 
We must use I in third and S in fourth.

So word pattern: L1 L2 I S L5

Available letters for L1, L2, L5: not C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T.

Let's think of common words:
- ""QUIDS"": Q,U,I,D,S -> pattern: Q U I D S -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D? -> doesn't match because fourth is D? We need fourth to be S.

But we can't change the fourth letter? It must be S.

So the word must be exactly: L1 L2 I S L5

Now:
- L1: any allowed letter
- L2: any allowed letter
- L5: any allowed letter

And the word must be English.

Possible words:
- ""BUILT""? Contains U,I,L,T -> but T is excluded? From guess2: T(x) -> T is not in the word. So ""BUILT"" has T? Not allowed.

- ""GUILD""? G,U,I,L,D -> pattern: G U I L D -> positions: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L -> but we need S in fourth? No.

- We must have S at fourth? So: _ _ I S _

- ""WHISP""? Not a standard word? ""Whisp"" is not common; usually ""wisp"".

- ""WISP"" is 4 letters.

5-letter words ending with I? But then fifth letter? 

Examples of 5-letter words ending with I? No, we need the fifth letter.

Another idea: ""KHIS""? Not 5 letters.

Let me search: words like: 
bliss, blissful not 5.
""ABYSS"" contains A and has Y,S,S? Pattern: A B Y S S -> positions: 1:A (excluded), 2:B, 3:Y, 4:S, 5:S? But A excluded? And Y in third? But we need I in third? No.

""GUISE"" has E -> excluded.

""POISE"" has O -> excluded.

""QUIPS"" as before doesn't fit.

""FRISK"" has R -> excluded.

""DISCS"" contains D,I,S,C,S -> C excluded? Also, pattern: D I S C S -> fourth letter C? not S? And we need I in third? Here I is second? No.

""TWIST"" contains T and is excluded? T is excluded? T(x) from guess2.

""PLIES"" contains P,L,I,E,S -> but E excluded? And pattern: P L I E S -> fourth letter E? not S.

But we need fourth to be S.

Another word: ""ADIE"" is 4 letter.

Perhaps ""AWISH"" not common.

Maybe ""FUZES"" has E? excluded.

We might have to use less common words.

But Wordle has a word list? We need to think of valid words.

Try: ""BLISE""? Not common, might not be valid. Does that word exist? Maybe ""BRAISE"" has R and A.

Perhaps ""BOWIS"" not a word.

Let me think of words that fit:
- ""WHISK"" as I thought earlier: W H I S K -> fits perfectly: 1:W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:S, 5:K -> and letters W,H,K are available? W - not excluded? H - not? K - not? And avoid excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T -> yes.

Additionally, ""WHISK"" is a valid English word.

So it should be acceptable.

Other possibilities? 
- ""PRISM"": P,R? R is excluded? So not allowed.
- ""FLITS"": F,L,I,T,S -> T excluded? So not allowed.
- ""QUIDS"": Q,U,I,D,S -> pattern: Q U I D S -> fourth is D? we need S at fourth? No.

Unless the word is spelled QUI? Then S? But ""QUIDS"" is Q-U-I-D-S -> fourth is D? So does not have S at fourth. The fourth letter is D.

Another word: ""SKIFF""? S,K,I,F,F -> pattern: S K I F F -> fourth letter F? not S.

So I think ""WHISK"" is a good choice: 
- Tests new letters: W, H, K.
- Fits the pattern: _ H I S K? But actually, it's W H I S K -> so positions: W at 1, H at 2, I at 3, S at 4, K at 5.

But the second letter is H, which we haven't tested.

If we guess ""WHISK"", we might get:
- If the secret word has W at start? 
- And H at second?
- And K at the end?

But we know I and S are fixed at positions 3 and 4.

Alternatively, we don't know, which is the point.

So I'll go with ""whisk"".

<guess>whisk</guess>
</think>
The feedback from previous guesses provides significant constraints:
- ""crane"": All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent, so they cannot be in the secret word.
- ""moist"":
  - M and O are absent → Exclude M and O.
  - I is correct and in position 3 → The third letter must be I.
  - S is correct and in position 4 → The fourth letter must be S.
  - T is absent → Exclude T.

Current known information about the secret word:
- Pattern: `_ _ I S _`
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T.
- Remaining letters for positions 1, 2, and 5: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The goal is to test common unsampled letters (e.g., H, K, W) while respecting the fixed ""I"" and ""S"" positions. ""Whisk"" fits perfectly:
- Pattern matches: W in position 1, H in position 2, I in position 3 (fixed), S in position 4 (fixed), K in position 5.
- Uses new high-frequency letters: W, H, K.
- Excludes forbidden letters and is a valid English word.

This guess maximizes information by testing three new letters in positions that may reveal their status.

<guess>whisk</guess>",whisk,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"": all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word)
2. ""moist"": 
   - M(x): absent
   - O(x): absent
   - I(✓): present and in the correct position (third letter)
   - S(✓): present and in the correct position (fourth letter)
   - T(x): absent

So, we know:
- The secret word has 'I' in the third position and 'S' in the fourth position.
- Therefore, the word pattern is: _ _ I S _ 
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits:
- Third letter: I
- Fourth letter: S
- Avoids letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T

Possible letters for the remaining positions: 
Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Available vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are either excluded or already used? Note: I is used but only in position 3, so we can have other vowels elsewhere)

However, note that I is already in position 3, but it could potentially appear again? The feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicate letters unless we guess. But in the feedback for ""moist"", we only got one I marked correct, so if there were another I, it might have been shown? Actually, the rules don't specify how duplicates are handled, but typically:
- If a letter appears only once in the secret word, and you guess two, one might show as absent? But this game uses symbols: ✓, -, x.

Looking back at the rules: each letter is marked independently. So for the secret word ""BRISK"", if you guessed ""STORM"", the first S is marked with '-' (present but wrong position) and the second S? Actually, in the example, there was no duplicate.

But in our case, the word ""moist"" had one I and one S, both marked correctly in position. There was no duplicate in our guess. Since we don't have duplicate letters in our guess, we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters.

So, we must consider that the secret word could have duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any indication so far.

However, note that in position 3 and 4 we have I and S fixed. So the word pattern: _ _ I S _

Now, we need to choose a word that:
- Starts with two letters and ends with one letter from the available set: avoiding C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T.
- These letters must include: for the first, second, and fifth positions.

Available letters: 
Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
Vowels: U (and sometimes Y)

We should try to cover more common letters to get information.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ _ I S _ 

Common words:
- DAISY? But contains A (excluded) and Y is allowed? However, A is in the exclusion list (from guess1: A(x)).
- FOCUS? Contains O and C (both excluded).
- LYSIS? Not common and has Y and S again? But S is already in the fourth, we can have another S? But let's see.

We need valid common words.

Consider:
- ""QUIZS""? No, not valid and must be 5 letters without S at the end? The pattern is _ _ I S _, so last letter is unknown.

Better examples:
- ""GUISE"": But E is excluded? And contains E -> not allowed.
- ""BLISS"": Contains B, L, I, S, S. Pattern: B L I S S -> _ _ I S _. But we have a duplicate S? And third letter I and fourth S are correct? However, we must avoid excluded letters. Does it contain excluded? B,L,I,S,S -> I and S are allowed, but B and L are new. However, E? No. But wait, our exclusion list: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T -> so B, L are allowed.
  But ""BLISS"" ends with two S's? The fifth letter would be S. So pattern: BLISS -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:I, 4:S, 5:S -> so fifth letter is S.

But note: in the feedback we already have S in the fourth as correct, but the fifth could be another S? It's possible.

However, we don't know if the secret word has duplicate S. But by the feedback rules, if the secret has one S and we guess a word with two S, one would be correct (if in right position) and the other might be marked as absent? Or depending on the rules.

But we haven't seen that scenario yet. So let's not guess duplicates until we have information.

Alternate words:
- ""SPLIS""? Not a word.
- ""WHISK"": W,H,I,S,K -> pattern: W H I S K -> matches? Positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:S, 5:K.
  Check letters: W, H, I, S, K.
  Excluded letters? W: new? Not in excluded list. H: new. K: new. And avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T -> yes.

But is ""WHISK"" valid? Yes, meaning a kitchen utensil.

We could use ""WHISK"" as our next guess.

Another common word: ""FLASK""? Contains A and L? Excluded? A is excluded from guess1. So ""FLASK"" has A -> not allowed.

Another: ""THUSK""? Not a word.

""BRISK"": B,R,I,S,K -> but R is excluded? From guess1: R(x) so R is not in the word. So cannot use R.

""DISKS"": D,I,S,K,S -> pattern: D I S K S -> wait, third letter would be S? But we need I in third and S in fourth? This word has I in second? Doesn't match.

Let's list words ending with IS_? 

We need:

- Position 1: a letter from available set
- Position 2: a letter from available set
- Position 5: a letter from available set

Words: 
- Can we have ""BLIPS""? B,L,I,P,S -> but the fourth letter would be P? then fifth S -> but we need S in fourth? So pattern is _ _ I S _, so BLIPS has fourth letter P? No.

Pattern: 1st: _, 2nd: _, 3rd: I, 4th: S, 5th: _

So:
- Position 1: letter1
- Position 2: letter2
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: letter5

So the word is: L1 L2 I S L5

Now, with L1, L2, L5 not being C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T.

And L1, L2, L5 must form a word.

Possible L5: we can use most letters.

Common words:
- ""GUISE"" -> but has E -> excluded.
- ""POISE"" -> has P,O,I,S,E -> O and E excluded.
- ""QUIPS"" -> Q,U,I,P,S -> pattern: Q U I P S -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:P -> wait, fourth is P? But we need S in fourth? No, this has I in third but fourth is P, then fifth S? So it would be QUI? Then P in fourth? But we need S in fourth. So not matching.

Actually, ""QUIPS"": Q-U-I-P-S -> 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S -> so fourth is P, not S. So doesn't match pattern.

We need the fourth letter to be S.

Another word: ""BASIS""? Contains B,A,I,S,S -> A excluded? Yes, A is in exclusion list.

""RADIS""? Not a word and contains A,R.

""DAILY""? Contains A -> excluded.

""JUMPS""? Contains M -> M was absent in guess2? So M is excluded? M(x) from moist? Yes.

So avoid M.

List of excluded letters now: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And vowels: U, and sometimes Y.

Words fitting _ _ I S _ :
Possible words:
- ""BLISS"": B,L,I,S,S -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:I, 4:S, 5:S -> ends with S. But S is repeated? However, L2 is L, which is allowed. Also, we test B and L. But fifth letter S is already known? But we don't know the fifth letter is S? So if we guess it, and it's wrong, we get information.

But we can do better: choose a word with completely new letters.

Other words:
- ""WHISK"": W,H,I,S,K -> W, H, K are new letters. This seems good.
- ""FRISK""? F,R? R is excluded (from guess1) -> cannot use.

- ""DISKS""? D,I,S,K,S -> but the fourth letter would be K? Then fifth S? Pattern: D I S K S -> so 1:D, 2:I, 3:S? But we need third to be I? No, in this word the third letter is S? Doesn't fit.

We need third letter I and fourth S.

- ""SKIPS""? S,K,I,P,S -> pattern: S K I P S -> positions: 1:S (which we know is not in the word? Wait, no: we know S is present and in fourth position. But does that mean it can't be elsewhere? Actually, in the secret word, S is at position four, but it might be elsewhere too? The feedback doesn't forbid that.

In feedback for ""moist"":
- S(✓) at position four: meaning S is at position four and correct. It doesn't say anything about other positions? But the symbol is only for the position guessed.

Yes, it's possible that S appears again in the word? But in our guess, we only have one S? So we don't know.

However, if we guess a word with two S, one at the correct fourth position and one elsewhere, then the other S would be marked as absent? Or if the secret word has two S, it would be marked as present? Let me check the rules.

The feedback symbols:
- ✓: letter in word and in correct position.
- - : letter in word but in wrong position.
- x: letter not in word.

If the secret word has two S's, and you guess a word with one S at the correct fourth position and another S elsewhere, then:
- The S in the fourth position would be ✓.
- The other S? 
  - If the secret word has a second S, then it would be marked as '-' if not in the same position? Or '✓' if by chance? But we placed it in a different position? So it would be marked '-' for wrong position?
  - But note: we don't know if there's a duplicate.

However, in our case, for ""moist"", we guessed only one S and it was correctly placed. But the secret word could still have another S? How? If the secret word was ""SISSY"", then in guess ""moist"", the fourth letter S is correct? But the secret word has S at positions 1 and 2 and 3 and 4? Then if we guess ""moist"" which has S in position 4 only, it would show S(✓) for the fourth? And if the secret word has other S's, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess them.

So duplicates are possible? But we haven't ruled them out.

But for now, let's avoid duplicates unless necessary.

Back to words: 
We must use I in third and S in fourth.

So word pattern: L1 L2 I S L5

Available letters for L1, L2, L5: not C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T.

Let's think of common words:
- ""QUIDS"": Q,U,I,D,S -> pattern: Q U I D S -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D? -> doesn't match because fourth is D? We need fourth to be S.

But we can't change the fourth letter? It must be S.

So the word must be exactly: L1 L2 I S L5

Now:
- L1: any allowed letter
- L2: any allowed letter
- L5: any allowed letter

And the word must be English.

Possible words:
- ""BUILT""? Contains U,I,L,T -> but T is excluded? From guess2: T(x) -> T is not in the word. So ""BUILT"" has T? Not allowed.

- ""GUILD""? G,U,I,L,D -> pattern: G U I L D -> positions: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L -> but we need S in fourth? No.

- We must have S at fourth? So: _ _ I S _

- ""WHISP""? Not a standard word? ""Whisp"" is not common; usually ""wisp"".

- ""WISP"" is 4 letters.

5-letter words ending with I? But then fifth letter? 

Examples of 5-letter words ending with I? No, we need the fifth letter.

Another idea: ""KHIS""? Not 5 letters.

Let me search: words like: 
bliss, blissful not 5.
""ABYSS"" contains A and has Y,S,S? Pattern: A B Y S S -> positions: 1:A (excluded), 2:B, 3:Y, 4:S, 5:S? But A excluded? And Y in third? But we need I in third? No.

""GUISE"" has E -> excluded.

""POISE"" has O -> excluded.

""QUIPS"" as before doesn't fit.

""FRISK"" has R -> excluded.

""DISCS"" contains D,I,S,C,S -> C excluded? Also, pattern: D I S C S -> fourth letter C? not S? And we need I in third? Here I is second? No.

""TWIST"" contains T and is excluded? T is excluded? T(x) from guess2.

""PLIES"" contains P,L,I,E,S -> but E excluded? And pattern: P L I E S -> fourth letter E? not S.

But we need fourth to be S.

Another word: ""ADIE"" is 4 letter.

Perhaps ""AWISH"" not common.

Maybe ""FUZES"" has E? excluded.

We might have to use less common words.

But Wordle has a word list? We need to think of valid words.

Try: ""BLISE""? Not common, might not be valid. Does that word exist? Maybe ""BRAISE"" has R and A.

Perhaps ""BOWIS"" not a word.

Let me think of words that fit:
- ""WHISK"" as I thought earlier: W H I S K -> fits perfectly: 1:W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:S, 5:K -> and letters W,H,K are available? W - not excluded? H - not? K - not? And avoid excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T -> yes.

Additionally, ""WHISK"" is a valid English word.

So it should be acceptable.

Other possibilities? 
- ""PRISM"": P,R? R is excluded? So not allowed.
- ""FLITS"": F,L,I,T,S -> T excluded? So not allowed.
- ""QUIDS"": Q,U,I,D,S -> pattern: Q U I D S -> fourth is D? we need S at fourth? No.

Unless the word is spelled QUI? Then S? But ""QUIDS"" is Q-U-I-D-S -> fourth is D? So does not have S at fourth. The fourth letter is D.

Another word: ""SKIFF""? S,K,I,F,F -> pattern: S K I F F -> fourth letter F? not S.

So I think ""WHISK"" is a good choice: 
- Tests new letters: W, H, K.
- Fits the pattern: _ H I S K? But actually, it's W H I S K -> so positions: W at 1, H at 2, I at 3, S at 4, K at 5.

But the second letter is H, which we haven't tested.

If we guess ""WHISK"", we might get:
- If the secret word has W at start? 
- And H at second?
- And K at the end?

But we know I and S are fixed at positions 3 and 4.

Alternatively, we don't know, which is the point.

So I'll go with ""whisk"".

<guess>whisk</guess>The feedback from previous guesses provides significant constraints:
- ""crane"": All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent, so they cannot be in the secret word.
- ""moist"":
  - M and O are absent → Exclude M and O.
  - I is correct and in position 3 → The third letter must be I.
  - S is correct and in position 4 → The fourth letter must be S.
  - T is absent → Exclude T.

Current known information about the secret word:
- Pattern: `_ _ I S _`
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T.
- Remaining letters for positions 1, 2, and 5: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The goal is to test common unsampled letters (e.g., H, K, W) while respecting the fixed ""I"" and ""S"" positions. ""Whisk"" fits perfectly:
- Pattern matches: W in position 1, H in position 2, I in position 3 (fixed), S in position 4 (fixed), K in position 5.
- Uses new high-frequency letters: W, H, K.
- Excludes forbidden letters and is a valid English word.

This guess maximizes information by testing three new letters in positions that may reveal their status.",Guess 3: whisk -> FEEDBACK: W(✓) H(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
