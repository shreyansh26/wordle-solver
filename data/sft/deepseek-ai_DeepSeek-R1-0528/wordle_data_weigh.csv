We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information we can get.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
 Some good starting words are: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AUDIO"", ""ROATE"", but note that we don't have any constraints.

 I'll choose a word that contains common letters and try to cover as much as possible.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"", because it has three vowels and common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one.

 Since I can choose any word, I'll pick ""SLATE"" for the first guess.

 But note: the rules require a valid English word. Both ""CRANE"" and ""SLATE"" are valid.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 After submitting ""CRANE"", we'll get feedback for each letter: C, R, A, N, E.

 Then in the next step we can use that feedback to narrow down.

 However, for the first guess, any is acceptable. Let me go with ""CRANE"".

I am making the first guess in this wordle game. Since I have no prior information, I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential information gain. For the first guess, it's advantageous to use a word with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to test multiple possibilities at once. The word ""CRANE"" is an effective starting word because it contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, N), while avoiding repeated letters. This will help reveal which letters exist in the secret word and possibly provide positional clues.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) -> C is not in the word
R(x) -> R is not in the word
A(x) -> A is not in the word
N(x) -> N is not in the word
E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter E, but not at the last position (since in ""crane"", E is the 5th letter and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

We have 6 tries and this was the first, so we have 5 left.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, N (since they are absent).
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (because in the first guess, E was in the 5th and it was present but wrong position).

Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information. Since we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and know E is present, we can try to use other vowels and common consonants.

Remaining vowels: I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but we'll avoid for now if possible).
Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We also note that E is in the word but not at the end. So in our next guess, we can try E in a different position (like 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th). However, we don't know which position is correct, so we might try to put E in a position we haven't tried.

But note: we have only tried E in the 5th position. So we can try E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words that:
- Include E (but not at the end) and avoid C, R, A, N.
- Include other common letters.

Possible words:
- We could try ""SPIEL"", but that has I and L, but note: we don't know about S, P, I, L yet. However, ""SPIEL"" has E in the 4th position? Let's check: S-P-I-E-L -> E is the 4th letter. But we don't know if 4th is correct. Also, it has 5 letters.

But we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N. ""SPIEL"" doesn't have any of these.

Alternatively, ""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> but E is at the end again (5th position). We know E is not at the 5th, so we should avoid putting E at the 5th. So ""HOUSE"" is not good because it puts E at the end.

Another idea: ""MEDIC"" -> but C is in it, and we know C is absent. So invalid.

""BELIE"": B-E-L-I-E -> but it has two E's? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, it has E at the 2nd and 5th. We know E is not at the 5th, so if we use this, the 5th E would be wrong and we already know that. But we can try to put E at the 2nd. However, the word ""BELIE"" is valid? But it has 5 letters: B-E-L-I-E. But note, the feedback for the first word only said E is present, but not how many. So the secret word might have one E or more.

But we are limited by the letters we can use. We must avoid C, R, A, N.

Let me list some words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N, and put E in a new position.

Possible positions for E: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.

We can try to put E at the beginning: words like ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", but ""ELBOW"" has 5 letters? E-L-B-O-W -> 5 letters. But we don't know about L, B, O, W.

But note: we also want to test other vowels and consonants.

Another common starting word is ""TOILS"", but it doesn't have E. We must include E.

So we need a word that includes E and 4 new letters (to maximize information).

Let me think of words with E in the 1st position: 
- ""EJECT"" -> but has E and C (C is absent) and repeated E? Also, C is absent so invalid.
- ""ELUDE"": E-L-U-D-E -> has E at 1st and 5th. We know 5th is not allowed, so we can't use this because it would put E at 5th again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we already know E is not at 5th. So we should avoid the 5th position for E.

We should avoid the 5th position for E because we know it's not there.

So let's avoid words that have E at the 5th.

Words with E at 1st: 
- ""EQUAL"" -> E-Q-U-A-L -> but A is absent (we know A is not in the word) so invalid.
- ""EXIST"" -> E-X-I-S-T -> avoids C,R,A,N. X and S, T are common. This might be good.

But ""EXIST"" has E at 1st, and we test X, I, S, T.

Words with E at 2nd:
- ""LEMON"" -> L-E-M-O-N -> but N is absent (we know N is not in the word) so invalid.
- ""DEPOT"" -> D-E-P-O-T -> avoids C,R,A,N. This is good. E is at 2nd position.

Words with E at 3rd:
- ""HOTEL"" -> H-O-T-E-L -> but E is at 4th? H(1)-O(2)-T(3)-E(4)-L(5). So E is at 4th? Actually, we want 3rd. 
- ""TEPID"" -> T-E-P-I-D -> E at 2nd? T(1)-E(2)-P(3)-I(4)-D(5). So for 3rd position: how about ""STEIN"" -> S-T-E-I-N -> but N is absent. 
- ""QUEST"" -> Q-U-E-S-T -> E at 3rd. Avoids C,R,A,N? Q, U, E, S, T. All new.

Words with E at 4th:
- ""TIMES"" -> T-I-M-E-S -> E at 4th. Avoids C,R,A,N.

Now, we have several options. We want to choose a word that uses common letters and doesn't repeat the position of E we already tried (5th). 

We also note that we have only one known letter (E) and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me evaluate:

Option 1: ""EXIST"" (E at 1st) -> tests E (1st), X, I, S, T.
Option 2: ""DEPOT"" (E at 2nd) -> tests D, E (2nd), P, O, T.
Option 3: ""QUEST"" (E at 3rd) -> tests Q, U, E (3rd), S, T.
Option 4: ""TIMES"" (E at 4th) -> tests T, I, M, E (4th), S.

We want to avoid rare letters if possible. Q and X are less common, so maybe avoid ""EXIST"" and ""QUEST"". 

""DEPOT"" uses common letters: D, E, P, O, T.

""TIMES"" uses T, I, M, E, S.

Both are good. But note: we have the letter S and T in both. 

We might also consider ""SPIEL"" (S-P-I-E-L) which has E at 4th? S(1), P(2), I(3), E(4), L(5). But we know E is not at 5th, so L is at 5th and we don't know about L. This is acceptable.

But ""SPIEL"" has L at the end, which is a common position.

Alternatively, ""BELOW"" (B-E-L-O-W) -> E at 2nd. Avoids C,R,A,N.

But we have many choices.

I think ""DEPOT"" is a good choice because:
- It has E in a new position (2nd).
- It tests D, P, O, T which are common.
- It doesn't use any of the absent letters.

So I'll go with ""DEPOT"".

But note: we must ensure it's a valid word. Yes, ""depot"" is a valid English word.

After this guess, we will get feedback on D, E, P, O, T and also the position of E (if it's at 2nd, we might get a check or a minus).

So let's choose ""DEPOT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"" for the 5th letter).

For the second guess:
- The word must include E (since it's confirmed present), but **avoid positions where E is incorrect** (e.g., not the 5th position).
- It must **exclude** C, R, A, and N (since they are absent).
- To maximize information, prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, D, P) and test E in a new position (positions 1–4).

The word ""**DEPOT**"" fits these criteria:
- Contains E in the **2nd position** (a new position to test).
- Avoids C, R, A, N, and the incorrect 5th position for E.
- Introduces new common letters: D, P, O, T.
- Is a valid English word.

<guess>depot</guess>",depot,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":

R(x) -> R is not in the word
A(x) -> A is not in the word
N(x) -> N is not in the word
E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter E, but not at the last position (since in ""crane"", E is the 5th letter and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

But we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N. ""SPIEL"" doesn't have any of these.

Alternatively, ""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> but E is at the end again (5th position). We know E is not at the 5th, so we should avoid putting E at the 5th. So ""HOUSE"" is not good because it puts E at the end.

Another idea: ""MEDIC"" -> but C is in it, and we know C is absent. So invalid.

""BELIE"": B-E-L-I-E -> but it has two E's? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, it has E at the 2nd and 5th. We know E is not at the 5th, so if we use this, the 5th E would be wrong and we already know that. But we can try to put E at the 2nd. However, the word ""BELIE"" is valid? But it has 5 letters: B-E-L-I-E. But note, the feedback for the first word only said E is present, but not how many. So the secret word might have one E or more.

But we are limited by the letters we can use. We must avoid C, R, A, N.

Let me list some words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N, and put E in a new position.

Possible positions for E: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.

We can try to put E at the beginning: words like ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", but ""ELBOW"" has 5 letters? E-L-B-O-W -> 5 letters. But we don't know about L, B, O, W.

But note: we also want to test other vowels and consonants.

Another common starting word is ""TOILS"", but it doesn't have E. We must include E.

So we need a word that includes E and 4 new letters (to maximize information).

Let me think of words with E in the 1st position: 
- ""EJECT"" -> but has E and C (C is absent) and repeated E? Also, C is absent so invalid.
- ""ELUDE"": E-L-U-D-E -> has E at 1st and 5th. We know 5th is not allowed, so we can't use this because it would put E at 5th again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we already know E is not at 5th. So we should avoid the 5th position for E.

We should avoid the 5th position for E because we know it's not there.

So let's avoid words that have E at the 5th.

Words with E at 1st: 
- ""EQUAL"" -> E-Q-U-A-L -> but A is absent (we know A is not in the word) so invalid.
- ""EXIST"" -> E-X-I-S-T -> avoids C,R,A,N. X and S, T are common. This might be good.

But ""EXIST"" has E at 1st, and we test X, I, S, T.

Words with E at 2nd:
- ""LEMON"" -> L-E-M-O-N -> but N is absent (we know N is not in the word) so invalid.
- ""DEPOT"" -> D-E-P-O-T -> avoids C,R,A,N. This is good. E is at 2nd position.

Words with E at 3rd:
- ""HOTEL"" -> H-O-T-E-L -> but E is at 4th? H(1)-O(2)-T(3)-E(4)-L(5). So E is at 4th? Actually, we want 3rd. 
- ""TEPID"" -> T-E-P-I-D -> E at 2nd? T(1)-E(2)-P(3)-I(4)-D(5). So for 3rd position: how about ""STEIN"" -> S-T-E-I-N -> but N is absent. 
- ""QUEST"" -> Q-U-E-S-T -> E at 3rd. Avoids C,R,A,N? Q, U, E, S, T. All new.

Words with E at 4th:
- ""TIMES"" -> T-I-M-E-S -> E at 4th. Avoids C,R,A,N.

Now, we have several options. We want to choose a word that uses common letters and doesn't repeat the position of E we already tried (5th). 

We also note that we have only one known letter (E) and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me evaluate:

Option 1: ""EXIST"" (E at 1st) -> tests E (1st), X, I, S, T.
Option 2: ""DEPOT"" (E at 2nd) -> tests D, E (2nd), P, O, T.
Option 3: ""QUEST"" (E at 3rd) -> tests Q, U, E (3rd), S, T.
Option 4: ""TIMES"" (E at 4th) -> tests T, I, M, E (4th), S.

We want to avoid rare letters if possible. Q and X are less common, so maybe avoid ""EXIST"" and ""QUEST"". 

""DEPOT"" uses common letters: D, E, P, O, T.

""TIMES"" uses T, I, M, E, S.

Both are good. But note: we have the letter S and T in both. 

We might also consider ""SPIEL"" (S-P-I-E-L) which has E at 4th? S(1), P(2), I(3), E(4), L(5). But we know E is not at 5th, so L is at 5th and we don't know about L. This is acceptable.

But ""SPIEL"" has L at the end, which is a common position.

Alternatively, ""BELOW"" (B-E-L-O-W) -> E at 2nd. Avoids C,R,A,N.

But we have many choices.

I think ""DEPOT"" is a good choice because:
- It has E in a new position (2nd).
- It tests D, P, O, T which are common.
- It doesn't use any of the absent letters.

So I'll go with ""DEPOT"".

But note: we must ensure it's a valid word. Yes, ""depot"" is a valid English word.

After this guess, we will get feedback on D, E, P, O, T and also the position of E (if it's at 2nd, we might get a check or a minus).

So let's choose ""DEPOT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"" for the 5th letter).

For the second guess:
- The word must include E (since it's confirmed present), but **avoid positions where E is incorrect** (e.g., not the 5th position).
- It must **exclude** C, R, A, and N (since they are absent).
- To maximize information, prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, D, P) and test E in a new position (positions 1–4).

The word ""**DEPOT**"" fits these criteria:
- Contains E in the **2nd position** (a new position to test).
- Avoids C, R, A, N, and the incorrect 5th position for E.
- Introduces new common letters: D, P, O, T.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information we can get.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
 Some good starting words are: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AUDIO"", ""ROATE"", but note that we don't have any constraints.

 I'll choose a word that contains common letters and try to cover as much as possible.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"", because it has three vowels and common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one.

 Since I can choose any word, I'll pick ""SLATE"" for the first guess.

 But note: the rules require a valid English word. Both ""CRANE"" and ""SLATE"" are valid.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 After submitting ""CRANE"", we'll get feedback for each letter: C, R, A, N, E.

 Then in the next step we can use that feedback to narrow down.

 However, for the first guess, any is acceptable. Let me go with ""CRANE"".I am making the first guess in this wordle game. Since I have no prior information, I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential information gain. For the first guess, it's advantageous to use a word with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to test multiple possibilities at once. The word ""CRANE"" is an effective starting word because it contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, N), while avoiding repeated letters. This will help reveal which letters exist in the secret word and possibly provide positional clues.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) -> C is not in the word
R(x) -> R is not in the word
A(x) -> A is not in the word
N(x) -> N is not in the word
E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter E, but not at the last position (since in ""crane"", E is the 5th letter and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

We have 6 tries and this was the first, so we have 5 left.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, N (since they are absent).
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (because in the first guess, E was in the 5th and it was present but wrong position).

Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information. Since we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and know E is present, we can try to use other vowels and common consonants.

Remaining vowels: I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but we'll avoid for now if possible).
Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We also note that E is in the word but not at the end. So in our next guess, we can try E in a different position (like 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th). However, we don't know which position is correct, so we might try to put E in a position we haven't tried.

But note: we have only tried E in the 5th position. So we can try E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words that:
- Include E (but not at the end) and avoid C, R, A, N.
- Include other common letters.

Possible words:
- We could try ""SPIEL"", but that has I and L, but note: we don't know about S, P, I, L yet. However, ""SPIEL"" has E in the 4th position? Let's check: S-P-I-E-L -> E is the 4th letter. But we don't know if 4th is correct. Also, it has 5 letters.

But we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N. ""SPIEL"" doesn't have any of these.

Alternatively, ""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> but E is at the end again (5th position). We know E is not at the 5th, so we should avoid putting E at the 5th. So ""HOUSE"" is not good because it puts E at the end.

Another idea: ""MEDIC"" -> but C is in it, and we know C is absent. So invalid.

""BELIE"": B-E-L-I-E -> but it has two E's? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, it has E at the 2nd and 5th. We know E is not at the 5th, so if we use this, the 5th E would be wrong and we already know that. But we can try to put E at the 2nd. However, the word ""BELIE"" is valid? But it has 5 letters: B-E-L-I-E. But note, the feedback for the first word only said E is present, but not how many. So the secret word might have one E or more.

But we are limited by the letters we can use. We must avoid C, R, A, N.

Let me list some words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N, and put E in a new position.

Possible positions for E: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.

We can try to put E at the beginning: words like ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", but ""ELBOW"" has 5 letters? E-L-B-O-W -> 5 letters. But we don't know about L, B, O, W.

But note: we also want to test other vowels and consonants.

Another common starting word is ""TOILS"", but it doesn't have E. We must include E.

So we need a word that includes E and 4 new letters (to maximize information).

Let me think of words with E in the 1st position: 
- ""EJECT"" -> but has E and C (C is absent) and repeated E? Also, C is absent so invalid.
- ""ELUDE"": E-L-U-D-E -> has E at 1st and 5th. We know 5th is not allowed, so we can't use this because it would put E at 5th again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we already know E is not at 5th. So we should avoid the 5th position for E.

We should avoid the 5th position for E because we know it's not there.

So let's avoid words that have E at the 5th.

Words with E at 1st: 
- ""EQUAL"" -> E-Q-U-A-L -> but A is absent (we know A is not in the word) so invalid.
- ""EXIST"" -> E-X-I-S-T -> avoids C,R,A,N. X and S, T are common. This might be good.

But ""EXIST"" has E at 1st, and we test X, I, S, T.

Words with E at 2nd:
- ""LEMON"" -> L-E-M-O-N -> but N is absent (we know N is not in the word) so invalid.
- ""DEPOT"" -> D-E-P-O-T -> avoids C,R,A,N. This is good. E is at 2nd position.

Words with E at 3rd:
- ""HOTEL"" -> H-O-T-E-L -> but E is at 4th? H(1)-O(2)-T(3)-E(4)-L(5). So E is at 4th? Actually, we want 3rd. 
- ""TEPID"" -> T-E-P-I-D -> E at 2nd? T(1)-E(2)-P(3)-I(4)-D(5). So for 3rd position: how about ""STEIN"" -> S-T-E-I-N -> but N is absent. 
- ""QUEST"" -> Q-U-E-S-T -> E at 3rd. Avoids C,R,A,N? Q, U, E, S, T. All new.

Words with E at 4th:
- ""TIMES"" -> T-I-M-E-S -> E at 4th. Avoids C,R,A,N.

Now, we have several options. We want to choose a word that uses common letters and doesn't repeat the position of E we already tried (5th). 

We also note that we have only one known letter (E) and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me evaluate:

Option 1: ""EXIST"" (E at 1st) -> tests E (1st), X, I, S, T.
Option 2: ""DEPOT"" (E at 2nd) -> tests D, E (2nd), P, O, T.
Option 3: ""QUEST"" (E at 3rd) -> tests Q, U, E (3rd), S, T.
Option 4: ""TIMES"" (E at 4th) -> tests T, I, M, E (4th), S.

We want to avoid rare letters if possible. Q and X are less common, so maybe avoid ""EXIST"" and ""QUEST"". 

""DEPOT"" uses common letters: D, E, P, O, T.

""TIMES"" uses T, I, M, E, S.

Both are good. But note: we have the letter S and T in both. 

We might also consider ""SPIEL"" (S-P-I-E-L) which has E at 4th? S(1), P(2), I(3), E(4), L(5). But we know E is not at 5th, so L is at 5th and we don't know about L. This is acceptable.

But ""SPIEL"" has L at the end, which is a common position.

Alternatively, ""BELOW"" (B-E-L-O-W) -> E at 2nd. Avoids C,R,A,N.

But we have many choices.

I think ""DEPOT"" is a good choice because:
- It has E in a new position (2nd).
- It tests D, P, O, T which are common.
- It doesn't use any of the absent letters.

So I'll go with ""DEPOT"".

But note: we must ensure it's a valid word. Yes, ""depot"" is a valid English word.

After this guess, we will get feedback on D, E, P, O, T and also the position of E (if it's at 2nd, we might get a check or a minus).

So let's choose ""DEPOT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"" for the 5th letter).

For the second guess:
- The word must include E (since it's confirmed present), but **avoid positions where E is incorrect** (e.g., not the 5th position).
- It must **exclude** C, R, A, and N (since they are absent).
- To maximize information, prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, D, P) and test E in a new position (positions 1–4).

The word ""**DEPOT**"" fits these criteria:
- Contains E in the **2nd position** (a new position to test).
- Avoids C, R, A, N, and the incorrect 5th position for E.
- Introduces new common letters: D, P, O, T.
- Is a valid English word.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""depot""
- D: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) -> so E is the second letter of the secret word.
- P: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)

Therefore, we know:
1. The second letter of the secret word is E. So the word has the form: _ E _ _ _
2. The following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, D, P, O, T. (We must avoid these in future guesses.)
3. E is confirmed and in the correct position (second), so we don't need to test E again.

We also know from the first guess that E is not at position 5, but now we know it is at position 2, so that is consistent.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We have to choose a 5-letter word that:
- Has E as the second letter (since it's fixed now).
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, D, P, O, T.
- We want to test new common letters to get more information.

What letters are left? We have not tested: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters in 5-letter words: S, L, I, U, M, B, G, H, K, etc.

The word structure: _ E _ _ _

We need to fill the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the remaining set, avoiding the absent ones.

We have 4 positions to fill and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Possible common letters to try: S, L, I, U, M, B, G, H, K.

We can try to form a word that uses several of these.

For example:
- Words with E in the second position: 

Let's list some words that fit:
- ""BELIE"": B E L I E -> but it has two E's? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we have to avoid the absent letters. B, L, I are not absent? But note: we have E at second and fifth? We know E is not at fifth from the first guess, so we cannot have E at fifth. So ""BELIE"" has E at fifth, which is invalid because we know E is not at fifth. So avoid.

- ""JELLY"": J E L L Y -> but L repeated? And J is not common. Also, we don't know about J, L, Y.

- ""HELLO"": H E L L O -> but O is absent (from guess 2: O is absent). So invalid.

- ""FELLS"": F E L L S -> but L repeated? And S at the end. But we don't know about F, L, S.

But we want to avoid repeated letters if possible to test more letters.

- ""BEIGE"": B E I G E -> again, E at fifth, which we know is not allowed. So invalid.

- ""KEBAB"": K E B A B -> but A is absent (from guess 1). Invalid.

- ""MELEE"": M E L E E -> multiple E's and E at fifth? Not allowed.

We need a word with E in second position and no E elsewhere, and no absent letters.

Let me think of words: 
- ""WEIGH"": W E I G H -> avoids absent letters? W, I, G, H are not in the absent list. And E is second. This is good.

- ""SEIZE"": S E I Z E -> has E at fifth? Not allowed.

- ""BEVEL"": B E V E L -> has E at fourth? B(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5). But E at fourth? We don't know if E can be at fourth? Actually, we know E is only at second, so if there is another E, it might be present but in the wrong position? But we don't know if the word has multiple E's. However, we know E is at second, so if we put E at fourth, it might be marked as present (if there is a second E) or absent (if not). But we are trying to avoid the fifth position, but fourth is new. However, we want to test new letters, so using E again might not be efficient. It's better to avoid E in other positions to test more new letters.

But note: we don't know if there is a second E. So we can test for that, but it might be better to assume one E for now and test other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word without E in other positions.

So ""WEIGH"" is good: W E I G H -> letters: W, I, G, H are all new.

Other options:
- ""LEMUR"": L E M U R -> but R is absent (from guess 1). Invalid.

- ""BEFOG"": B E F O G -> O is absent. Invalid.

- ""HEIST"": H E I S T -> but T is absent (from guess 2). Invalid.

- ""JEWEL"": J E W E L -> has E at fourth? And we don't know about J, W, L. But E at fourth: if the word has only one E, then the E at fourth would be absent? But we don't know. Also, J is not common.

- ""MELTY"": M E L T Y -> T is absent. Invalid.

- ""PESKY"": P E S K Y -> P is absent. Invalid.

- ""SEWER"": S E W E R -> R absent and E at fifth? Not allowed.

So ""WEIGH"" seems a good candidate: W, E, I, G, H. All new letters except E which is fixed.

Another word: ""BELLY"": B E L L Y -> but L repeated? And we test B, L, Y. But repeated L might be less informative.

""WEIGH"" tests four new letters: W, I, G, H.

We can also consider ""HELIX"": H E L I X -> avoids absent letters? H, L, I, X. But X is less common. Still, it's valid.

""HELIX"" is a word? Yes, meaning a spiral.

But ""WEIGH"" is more common.

Another one: ""FEIGN"": F E I G N -> but N is absent. Invalid.

""KEECH"": K E E C H -> has E repeated and C absent. Invalid.

So ""WEIGH"" is a good choice.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""Weigh"" is a valid English word.

We can also consider ""SEISM"": S E I S M -> S repeated? S at first and fourth? But we test S, I, M. Not as good because of repetition.

""BEING"": B E I N G -> but N is absent. Invalid.

So I think ""WEIGH"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, for the third guess, we'll use ""WEIGH"".

After this, we'll get feedback on W, I, G, H and the position of E (which is fixed and correct).

So let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **C, R, A, N, D, P, O, T** are **absent** (eliminated).
- **E** is **confirmed in position 2** (so the word pattern is `_ E _ _ _`).
- E cannot appear in position 5 (from Guess 1 feedback).

For the third guess:
- The word must have **E in position 2**.
- It must **exclude all absent letters** (C, R, A, N, D, P, O, T).
- To maximize information, prioritize **new, common letters** (e.g., S, L, I, U, B, G, H, K, M) and avoid retesting known positions.

The word **""WEIGH""** fits perfectly:
- Follows the pattern `_ E _ _ _` (E in position 2).
- Avoids all absent letters and position 5 for E.
- Tests 4 new common letters: **W** (position 1), **I** (position 3), **G** (position 4), **H** (position 5).
- Is a valid English word.

<guess>weigh</guess>",weigh,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""depot""
- D: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) -> so E is the second letter of the secret word.
- P: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)

Therefore, we know:
1. The second letter of the secret word is E. So the word has the form: _ E _ _ _
2. The following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, D, P, O, T. (We must avoid these in future guesses.)
3. E is confirmed and in the correct position (second), so we don't need to test E again.

We also know from the first guess that E is not at position 5, but now we know it is at position 2, so that is consistent.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We have to choose a 5-letter word that:
- Has E as the second letter (since it's fixed now).
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, D, P, O, T.
- We want to test new common letters to get more information.

What letters are left? We have not tested: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters in 5-letter words: S, L, I, U, M, B, G, H, K, etc.

The word structure: _ E _ _ _

We need to fill the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the remaining set, avoiding the absent ones.

We have 4 positions to fill and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Possible common letters to try: S, L, I, U, M, B, G, H, K.

We can try to form a word that uses several of these.

For example:
- Words with E in the second position: 

Let's list some words that fit:
- ""BELIE"": B E L I E -> but it has two E's? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we have to avoid the absent letters. B, L, I are not absent? But note: we have E at second and fifth? We know E is not at fifth from the first guess, so we cannot have E at fifth. So ""BELIE"" has E at fifth, which is invalid because we know E is not at fifth. So avoid.

- ""JELLY"": J E L L Y -> but L repeated? And J is not common. Also, we don't know about J, L, Y.

- ""HELLO"": H E L L O -> but O is absent (from guess 2: O is absent). So invalid.

- ""FELLS"": F E L L S -> but L repeated? And S at the end. But we don't know about F, L, S.

But we want to avoid repeated letters if possible to test more letters.

- ""BEIGE"": B E I G E -> again, E at fifth, which we know is not allowed. So invalid.

- ""KEBAB"": K E B A B -> but A is absent (from guess 1). Invalid.

- ""MELEE"": M E L E E -> multiple E's and E at fifth? Not allowed.

We need a word with E in second position and no E elsewhere, and no absent letters.

Let me think of words: 
- ""WEIGH"": W E I G H -> avoids absent letters? W, I, G, H are not in the absent list. And E is second. This is good.

- ""SEIZE"": S E I Z E -> has E at fifth? Not allowed.

- ""BEVEL"": B E V E L -> has E at fourth? B(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5). But E at fourth? We don't know if E can be at fourth? Actually, we know E is only at second, so if there is another E, it might be present but in the wrong position? But we don't know if the word has multiple E's. However, we know E is at second, so if we put E at fourth, it might be marked as present (if there is a second E) or absent (if not). But we are trying to avoid the fifth position, but fourth is new. However, we want to test new letters, so using E again might not be efficient. It's better to avoid E in other positions to test more new letters.

But note: we don't know if there is a second E. So we can test for that, but it might be better to assume one E for now and test other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word without E in other positions.

So ""WEIGH"" is good: W E I G H -> letters: W, I, G, H are all new.

Other options:
- ""LEMUR"": L E M U R -> but R is absent (from guess 1). Invalid.

- ""BEFOG"": B E F O G -> O is absent. Invalid.

- ""HEIST"": H E I S T -> but T is absent (from guess 2). Invalid.

- ""JEWEL"": J E W E L -> has E at fourth? And we don't know about J, W, L. But E at fourth: if the word has only one E, then the E at fourth would be absent? But we don't know. Also, J is not common.

- ""MELTY"": M E L T Y -> T is absent. Invalid.

- ""PESKY"": P E S K Y -> P is absent. Invalid.

- ""SEWER"": S E W E R -> R absent and E at fifth? Not allowed.

So ""WEIGH"" seems a good candidate: W, E, I, G, H. All new letters except E which is fixed.

Another word: ""BELLY"": B E L L Y -> but L repeated? And we test B, L, Y. But repeated L might be less informative.

""WEIGH"" tests four new letters: W, I, G, H.

We can also consider ""HELIX"": H E L I X -> avoids absent letters? H, L, I, X. But X is less common. Still, it's valid.

""HELIX"" is a word? Yes, meaning a spiral.

But ""WEIGH"" is more common.

Another one: ""FEIGN"": F E I G N -> but N is absent. Invalid.

""KEECH"": K E E C H -> has E repeated and C absent. Invalid.

So ""WEIGH"" is a good choice.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""Weigh"" is a valid English word.

We can also consider ""SEISM"": S E I S M -> S repeated? S at first and fourth? But we test S, I, M. Not as good because of repetition.

""BEING"": B E I N G -> but N is absent. Invalid.

So I think ""WEIGH"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, for the third guess, we'll use ""WEIGH"".

After this, we'll get feedback on W, I, G, H and the position of E (which is fixed and correct).
