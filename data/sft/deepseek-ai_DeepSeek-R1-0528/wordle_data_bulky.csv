 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)

 This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Since these are very common letters, we have to pick from the remaining letters.

 Let's think about what letters are still available.

 The English alphabet has 26 letters. We excluded C, R, A, N, E. That leaves: 
 B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We should aim for a word that has common letters from the remaining set.

 Common vowels left: I, O, U (but we don't have E or A anymore, so we may have to use I or O as vowels).

 Common consonants left: S, T, L, M, etc.

 A good starting point might be a word with S and T, which are high frequency.

 Let's try to find a word without the excluded letters and with some common remaining letters.

 Consider words like ""SLOTH"", but note that O is available and H is available.

 Another option: ""SPLIT"", but let me check if available letters.

 Alternatively, ""TOILS"" or ""STOMP"".

 Since we want to cover more common letters, I was considering:

 Option 1: ""OUIJA"" -> but that has U, I, J and is not too common? Also, J is less common.

 Option 2: ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S -> all available.

 But let me check if there's a better word.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a common second guess. Let's see: M, O, I, S, T -> all in the available letters.

 And MOIST uses 5 new letters and includes two vowels (O and I) and three common consonants (M, S, T).

 So I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""moist"".

Based on the previous feedback that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word, I selected a new word that avoids these letters entirely. My goal is to test other common letters instead, focusing on consonants like S, T, M and vowels like O, I.

We have two guesses with feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> All letters marked as absent: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ""moist"" -> All letters marked as absent: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) T(x)

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.

That's 10 letters eliminated. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so remaining letters are:
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Note: We need a 5-letter word using only these letters.

Now, we have to form a word from the remaining 16 letters. Some words that come to mind:

- ""PLUMB"": But note that B is available, and P, L, U, M? Wait, M is eliminated (from ""moist""). So M is out.

List of eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T

So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (16 letters)

We need a word that uses only these letters. Let me think:

Common vowels remaining: U (and sometimes Y), but note that we have eliminated A, E, I, O. So the only vowel left is U? And Y can sometimes act as a vowel.

So words must contain U or Y as a vowel? Not necessarily; some words use consonants and Y, like ""GYPSY"", but that has S (eliminated) and P, but S is out.

Let's search for 5-letter words without the eliminated letters.

Possibilities:

- ""LUCKY"": L, U, C, K, Y -> C is eliminated? Yes, C is in the first guess and marked absent. So no.

- ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> all available? Check: P, U, D, G, Y. Eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. So P, U, D, G, Y are all available. And ""pudgy"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""BUGLE"" -> B, U, G, L, E. But E is eliminated (from first guess). So no.

""JUMPY"": J, U, M, P, Y -> M is eliminated (from guess 2). So no.

""FUDGY"": F, U, D, G, Y -> all available? F,U,D,G,Y: yes, and F is available.

But ""fudgy"" and ""pudgy"" are both valid.

Another word: ""QUICK"": Q,U,I,C,K -> I and C are eliminated. Not allowed.

""GULPY"": G, U, L, P, Y -> all available? G,U,L,P,Y: yes.

But ""gulpy"" may not be a common word? We should stick to common words.

""HUMPH"": H, U, M, P, H -> M is eliminated? Yes, from ""moist"". So no.

""VWXYZ"" - not a word.

""BULKY"": B, U, L, K, Y -> B,U,L,K,Y: all available? B: yes, U: yes, L: yes, K: yes, Y: yes.

And ""bulky"" is a common word.

Other options: ""DUVET"" -> D,U,V,E,T -> E and T are eliminated. No.

""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> E eliminated. No.

""JUMPS"": J,U,M,P,S -> M and S eliminated. No.

""WIMPY"": W,I,M,P,Y -> I and M eliminated. No.

""POWER"": P,O,W,E,R -> O,E,R eliminated. No.

""QUACK"": Q,U,A,C,K -> A and C eliminated. No.

""QUAFF"": Q,U,A,F,F -> A eliminated. So no.

""QUAGM"" - not a word.

""QUIPU"": Q,U,I,P,U -> I eliminated.

""KUDZU"": K,U,D,Z,U -> Z not used else, but U appears twice. Available letters: K,U,D,Z are available? K,U,D,Z: yes. But ""kudzu"" is a word, and let me check: K,U,D,Z,U -> so U repeated? We can have repeated letters? The rules didn't say they must be distinct. But the secret word might have repeated letters? In the example, it didn't. But it is possible.

Feedback format doesn't forbid repeated letters. But in this case, ""kudzu"" has two U's.

Similarly, ""FUZZY"": F,U,Z,Z,Y -> has two Z's. F,U,Z,Y available? F,U,Z,Y: Z is available? Z is in the available list? Yes, we have Z.

But ""fuzzy"" has two Z's.

However, we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. So we can guess words with repeated letters? But to maximize information, maybe we avoid repeats for now.

But in this situation, we have limited letters. So might have to allow repeats.

But let me see: We need 5-letter words from the available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Now, common words:

- ""BUGLE"" - has U and E? E eliminated.

- ""PLUMB"" - P,L,U,M,B -> M eliminated.

I don't think ""gulpy"" is standard. Let me think of standard words:

- ""LUCKY"" - has C and K? C eliminated? Yes, so no.

Actually, ""LUCKY"" has C. So invalid.

What about ""PUDGY""? P,U,D,G,Y -> all good. That's a valid word.

""FUDGY"" similarly.

""BULKY"": B,U,L,K,Y. Valid.

""JUMBO"": J,U,M,B,O -> M and O eliminated. No.

""QUIET"": has I and E. No.

So we can use:

1. ""PUDGY""
2. ""FUDGY""
3. ""BULKY""
4. ""GULPY"" - but this might not be very common? Or is it? Normally, ""gulpy"" is not as common. We should choose among the common ones.

Another one: ""JUMPY"" - J,U,M,P,Y, M eliminated? From guess 2, M(x), so M is eliminated. Not allowed.

""KAYAK"" - K,A,Y,A,K -> A eliminated? Yes, A is in first feedback and absent. So no.

""BOXED"" - B,O,X,E,D -> O and E eliminated? O from ""moist"" is absent, E absent. No.

""VOWEL"" - V,O,W,E,L -> O,E eliminated. No.

""GLYPH"" - G,L,Y,P,H -> all letters: G,L,Y,P,H? Check if available: G,L,Y,P,H are all in the available set. And H is available? Yes, eliminated list: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. So H is available.

""Glyph"" is a valid word: meaning a symbol or a character.

Also, ""glyph"" uses 5 distinct letters, which is good.

Now, comparing ""pudgy"", ""fudgy"", ""bulky"", and ""glyph"":

- ""pudgy"": P,U,D,G,Y
- ""fudgy"": F,U,D,G,Y
- ""bulky"": B,U,L,K,Y
- ""glyph"": G,L,Y,P,H

We also have ""WIMPY"" - but W,I,M,P,Y -> I and M eliminated? Yes.

""LYMPH"" - L,Y,M,P,H -> M eliminated.

So among these, all are valid.

But we need to choose one that tests new letters. Since we have tested no letters correctly so far, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

For example, in ""glyph"", the letters: G,L,Y,P,H. We haven't tested any of these.

Similarly, ""bulky"": B,U,L,K,Y tests B,U,L,K,Y.

""pudgy"": P,U,D,G,Y tests P,U,D,G,Y.

We also have V and W, etc. not tested.

Perhaps we can consider words with V or W.

For example, ""VAGUE"" - but A and E eliminated? A from first guess.

""QUAFF"" - Q,U,A,F,F -> A eliminated.

""QUICK"" - no, I eliminated.

""JUVEN"" - not a word? Or ""juvenile"" is longer.

""BLITZ"" - B,L,I,T,Z -> I and T eliminated? T from ""moist"" is absent. So no.

""FLUFF"" - F,L,U,F,F -> F repeated? And U. But F,L,U available? L is available? L is still available? Eliminated letters don't include L.

First guess: crane -> L was not guessed? Crane has C,R,A,N,E. No L.

Second guess: moist -> M,O,I,S,T. No L.

So L is available.

But ""FLUFF"" has F twice and U, and it's a word? But not 5 distinct, which might be less informative.

But the secret word could have repeats.

However, we prefer words with distinct letters to maximize information.

So avoid repeats if possible.

Let me list distinct letter words:

- GLYPH: G,L,Y,P,H -> distinct letters: 5
- BULKY: B,U,L,K,Y -> distinct: 5
- PUDGY: P,U,D,G,Y -> distinct: 5
- FUDGY: similar to pudgy, but F and D.

FUDGY: F,U,D,G,Y -> distinct.

Another word: ""WHACK"" - W,H,A,C,K -> A and C eliminated? Yes.

""QUASH"" - Q,U,A,S,H -> A and S eliminated? S from ""moist"" absent. No.

""YUCKS"" - Y,U,C,K,S -> C and S absent? No.

""DUVET"" - D,U,V,E,T -> E and T absent? And V is available.

E and T are absent.

""ZESTY"" - Z,E,S,T,Y -> E,S,T absent? E from crane, S and T from moist? All absent. So no.

But V is available. How about words with V?

""GUAVA"" - G,U,A,V,A -> A absent and repeated letters? A absent.

""VAGUS"" - V,A,G,U,S -> A absent and S absent.

Not working.

""VALID"" - V,A,L,I,D -> A and I absent.

""VOICE"" - V,O,I,C,E -> all absent? O,I,C,E absent.

But O is eliminated from moist.

So hard.

What about ""JUMPS""? M and S eliminated? No.

""WAVED"" - W,A,V,E,D -> A and E absent.

No.

Perhaps ""UNZIP"" - U,N,Z,I,P -> N and I absent? N from crane? Yes, eliminated. I eliminated.

No.

So we might have to stick with the words without V, W, etc.

Another possibility: ""KAYAK"" but A and K? A absent? And repeated letters? K repeated.

Not useful.

""PUPPY"" - P,U,P,P,Y -> repeated P, and not distinct.

Similarly, ""FUZZY"" - F,U,Z,Z,Y -> Z repeated.

Better to choose one of the distinct letter words.

Now, among ""glyph"", ""bulky"", ""pudgy"", ""fudgy"", which one?

""Glyph"" does not have U, which is important because U is the only vowel left? Let me see: U is available, and in some words U is used as a vowel.

But ""glyph"" has Y as vowel? Words like ""glyph"" can be formed without U.

Similarly, ""bulky"" has U.

Perhaps guessing a word with U might be better because the secret word must contain vowels? Eliminated vowels: A, E, I, O. So only U and Y remain as vowels? And sometimes W and Y, but U is a strong vowel candidate.

Therefore, the word likely contains U.

So words with U: bulky, pudgy, fudgy.

""glyph"" has no U, but the word might have U? Or not? Not necessarily, but without vowels? ""glyph"" has Y acting as a vowel? It is a word.

Similarly, ""myths"" - but M and S eliminated.

""cysts"" - C and S eliminated.

So ""glyph"" is a word without U.

But perhaps it's rarer.

On the other hand, ""bulky"", ""pudgy"", ""fudgy"" are more common.

Let me choose ""bulky"" because it tests B,U,L,K,Y. Which are all new.

Similarly pudgy tests P,U,D,G,Y. fudgy tests F,U,D,G,Y.

L and K are common consonants.

In pudgy and fudgy, D and G are tested.

But bulky has L and K, which might be more frequent? We don't know.

We can also consider ""GLYPH"" to cover G,L,Y,P,H.

But H is also common.

Since U might be critical, I think guessing U is wise.

So I'll go with ""bulky"" or ""pudgy"".

But ""fudgy"" is similar.

Another word: ""DUTCH"" - D,U,T,C,H -> T and C eliminated? T from moist is absent? T(x) so absent. C absent? From crane.

Not allowed.

""PLUCK"" - P,L,U,C,K -> C eliminated.

So not.

""LUCKY"" not.

So I think ""bulky"" is a fine choice.

We can also consider ""JUMP"" but not 5 letters. Must be 5 letters.

""BAYOU"" - B,A,Y,O,U -> A and O eliminated? From crane and moist? A and O both absent? Yes. So invalid.

So no.

Therefore, I'll guess ""BULKY"".

But note: in feedback, we'll get marks for any letter present. But since no letters are correct so far, we might get some hits.

So guess ""BULKY"".

But let's confirm: the word must be common. ""Bulky"" is a common word.

Alternative: ""PUDGY"" - also common.

I'll go with ""BULKY"".

So <guess>bulky</guess>

But in the response format, we just put the guess.

So, after thinking step by step.

Step-by-step:
- We eliminated 10 letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.
- Only B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z remain.
- We need a 5-letter word from these. 
- We considered words like ""glyph"", ""pudgy"", ""fudgy"", ""bulky"".
- Since U is an important vowel, we choose a word containing U like ""bulky"".
</think>
We have two previous guesses with no correct letters:  
- ""crane"" had all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E  
- ""moist"" had all letters absent: M, O, I, S, T  

This eliminates 10 letters (C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T). The remaining available letters are:  
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

The secret word must be a 5-letter English word using only these letters. Since vowels A, E, I, O are eliminated, it's likely that U or Y acts as a vowel. Common words fitting this criteria include:  
- ""bulky"" (B, U, L, K, Y)  
- ""pudgy"" (P, U, D, G, Y)  
- ""fudgy"" (F, U, D, G, Y)  
- ""glyph"" (G, L, Y, P, H)  

I choose ""bulky"" because:  
- It uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.  
- It contains U, which is a strong vowel candidate in the remaining letters.  
- B, L, K, Y are common consonants that could appear in the word.  

<guess>bulky</guess>",bulky,"We have two guesses with feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> All letters marked as absent: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ""moist"" -> All letters marked as absent: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) T(x)

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.

That's 10 letters eliminated. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so remaining letters are:
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Note: We need a 5-letter word using only these letters.

Now, we have to form a word from the remaining 16 letters. Some words that come to mind:

- ""PLUMB"": But note that B is available, and P, L, U, M? Wait, M is eliminated (from ""moist""). So M is out.

List of eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T

So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (16 letters)

We need a word that uses only these letters. Let me think:

Common vowels remaining: U (and sometimes Y), but note that we have eliminated A, E, I, O. So the only vowel left is U? And Y can sometimes act as a vowel.

So words must contain U or Y as a vowel? Not necessarily; some words use consonants and Y, like ""GYPSY"", but that has S (eliminated) and P, but S is out.

Let's search for 5-letter words without the eliminated letters.

Possibilities:

- ""LUCKY"": L, U, C, K, Y -> C is eliminated? Yes, C is in the first guess and marked absent. So no.

- ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> all available? Check: P, U, D, G, Y. Eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. So P, U, D, G, Y are all available. And ""pudgy"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""BUGLE"" -> B, U, G, L, E. But E is eliminated (from first guess). So no.

""JUMPY"": J, U, M, P, Y -> M is eliminated (from guess 2). So no.

""FUDGY"": F, U, D, G, Y -> all available? F,U,D,G,Y: yes, and F is available.

But ""fudgy"" and ""pudgy"" are both valid.

Another word: ""QUICK"": Q,U,I,C,K -> I and C are eliminated. Not allowed.

""GULPY"": G, U, L, P, Y -> all available? G,U,L,P,Y: yes.

But ""gulpy"" may not be a common word? We should stick to common words.

""HUMPH"": H, U, M, P, H -> M is eliminated? Yes, from ""moist"". So no.

""VWXYZ"" - not a word.

""BULKY"": B, U, L, K, Y -> B,U,L,K,Y: all available? B: yes, U: yes, L: yes, K: yes, Y: yes.

And ""bulky"" is a common word.

Other options: ""DUVET"" -> D,U,V,E,T -> E and T are eliminated. No.

""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> E eliminated. No.

""JUMPS"": J,U,M,P,S -> M and S eliminated. No.

""WIMPY"": W,I,M,P,Y -> I and M eliminated. No.

""POWER"": P,O,W,E,R -> O,E,R eliminated. No.

""QUACK"": Q,U,A,C,K -> A and C eliminated. No.

""QUAFF"": Q,U,A,F,F -> A eliminated. So no.

""QUAGM"" - not a word.

""QUIPU"": Q,U,I,P,U -> I eliminated.

""KUDZU"": K,U,D,Z,U -> Z not used else, but U appears twice. Available letters: K,U,D,Z are available? K,U,D,Z: yes. But ""kudzu"" is a word, and let me check: K,U,D,Z,U -> so U repeated? We can have repeated letters? The rules didn't say they must be distinct. But the secret word might have repeated letters? In the example, it didn't. But it is possible.

Feedback format doesn't forbid repeated letters. But in this case, ""kudzu"" has two U's.

Similarly, ""FUZZY"": F,U,Z,Z,Y -> has two Z's. F,U,Z,Y available? F,U,Z,Y: Z is available? Z is in the available list? Yes, we have Z.

But ""fuzzy"" has two Z's.

However, we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. So we can guess words with repeated letters? But to maximize information, maybe we avoid repeats for now.

But in this situation, we have limited letters. So might have to allow repeats.

But let me see: We need 5-letter words from the available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Now, common words:

- ""BUGLE"" - has U and E? E eliminated.

- ""PLUMB"" - P,L,U,M,B -> M eliminated.

I don't think ""gulpy"" is standard. Let me think of standard words:

- ""LUCKY"" - has C and K? C eliminated? Yes, so no.

Actually, ""LUCKY"" has C. So invalid.

What about ""PUDGY""? P,U,D,G,Y -> all good. That's a valid word.

""FUDGY"" similarly.

""BULKY"": B,U,L,K,Y. Valid.

""JUMBO"": J,U,M,B,O -> M and O eliminated. No.

""QUIET"": has I and E. No.

So we can use:

1. ""PUDGY""
2. ""FUDGY""
3. ""BULKY""
4. ""GULPY"" - but this might not be very common? Or is it? Normally, ""gulpy"" is not as common. We should choose among the common ones.

Another one: ""JUMPY"" - J,U,M,P,Y, M eliminated? From guess 2, M(x), so M is eliminated. Not allowed.

""KAYAK"" - K,A,Y,A,K -> A eliminated? Yes, A is in first feedback and absent. So no.

""BOXED"" - B,O,X,E,D -> O and E eliminated? O from ""moist"" is absent, E absent. No.

""VOWEL"" - V,O,W,E,L -> O,E eliminated. No.

""GLYPH"" - G,L,Y,P,H -> all letters: G,L,Y,P,H? Check if available: G,L,Y,P,H are all in the available set. And H is available? Yes, eliminated list: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. So H is available.

""Glyph"" is a valid word: meaning a symbol or a character.

Also, ""glyph"" uses 5 distinct letters, which is good.

Now, comparing ""pudgy"", ""fudgy"", ""bulky"", and ""glyph"":

- ""pudgy"": P,U,D,G,Y
- ""fudgy"": F,U,D,G,Y
- ""bulky"": B,U,L,K,Y
- ""glyph"": G,L,Y,P,H

We also have ""WIMPY"" - but W,I,M,P,Y -> I and M eliminated? Yes.

""LYMPH"" - L,Y,M,P,H -> M eliminated.

So among these, all are valid.

But we need to choose one that tests new letters. Since we have tested no letters correctly so far, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

For example, in ""glyph"", the letters: G,L,Y,P,H. We haven't tested any of these.

Similarly, ""bulky"": B,U,L,K,Y tests B,U,L,K,Y.

""pudgy"": P,U,D,G,Y tests P,U,D,G,Y.

We also have V and W, etc. not tested.

Perhaps we can consider words with V or W.

For example, ""VAGUE"" - but A and E eliminated? A from first guess.

""QUAFF"" - Q,U,A,F,F -> A eliminated.

""QUICK"" - no, I eliminated.

""JUVEN"" - not a word? Or ""juvenile"" is longer.

""BLITZ"" - B,L,I,T,Z -> I and T eliminated? T from ""moist"" is absent. So no.

""FLUFF"" - F,L,U,F,F -> F repeated? And U. But F,L,U available? L is available? L is still available? Eliminated letters don't include L.

First guess: crane -> L was not guessed? Crane has C,R,A,N,E. No L.

Second guess: moist -> M,O,I,S,T. No L.

So L is available.

But ""FLUFF"" has F twice and U, and it's a word? But not 5 distinct, which might be less informative.

But the secret word could have repeats.

However, we prefer words with distinct letters to maximize information.

So avoid repeats if possible.

Let me list distinct letter words:

- GLYPH: G,L,Y,P,H -> distinct letters: 5
- BULKY: B,U,L,K,Y -> distinct: 5
- PUDGY: P,U,D,G,Y -> distinct: 5
- FUDGY: similar to pudgy, but F and D.

FUDGY: F,U,D,G,Y -> distinct.

Another word: ""WHACK"" - W,H,A,C,K -> A and C eliminated? Yes.

""QUASH"" - Q,U,A,S,H -> A and S eliminated? S from ""moist"" absent. No.

""YUCKS"" - Y,U,C,K,S -> C and S absent? No.

""DUVET"" - D,U,V,E,T -> E and T absent? And V is available.

E and T are absent.

""ZESTY"" - Z,E,S,T,Y -> E,S,T absent? E from crane, S and T from moist? All absent. So no.

But V is available. How about words with V?

""GUAVA"" - G,U,A,V,A -> A absent and repeated letters? A absent.

""VAGUS"" - V,A,G,U,S -> A absent and S absent.

Not working.

""VALID"" - V,A,L,I,D -> A and I absent.

""VOICE"" - V,O,I,C,E -> all absent? O,I,C,E absent.

But O is eliminated from moist.

So hard.

What about ""JUMPS""? M and S eliminated? No.

""WAVED"" - W,A,V,E,D -> A and E absent.

No.

Perhaps ""UNZIP"" - U,N,Z,I,P -> N and I absent? N from crane? Yes, eliminated. I eliminated.

No.

So we might have to stick with the words without V, W, etc.

Another possibility: ""KAYAK"" but A and K? A absent? And repeated letters? K repeated.

Not useful.

""PUPPY"" - P,U,P,P,Y -> repeated P, and not distinct.

Similarly, ""FUZZY"" - F,U,Z,Z,Y -> Z repeated.

Better to choose one of the distinct letter words.

Now, among ""glyph"", ""bulky"", ""pudgy"", ""fudgy"", which one?

""Glyph"" does not have U, which is important because U is the only vowel left? Let me see: U is available, and in some words U is used as a vowel.

Similarly, ""myths"" - but M and S eliminated.

""cysts"" - C and S eliminated.

So ""glyph"" is a word without U.

But perhaps it's rarer.

On the other hand, ""bulky"", ""pudgy"", ""fudgy"" are more common.

Let me choose ""bulky"" because it tests B,U,L,K,Y. Which are all new.

Similarly pudgy tests P,U,D,G,Y. fudgy tests F,U,D,G,Y.

L and K are common consonants.

Not allowed.

""PLUCK"" - P,L,U,C,K -> C eliminated.

So not.

""LUCKY"" not.

So I think ""bulky"" is a fine choice.

We can also consider ""JUMP"" but not 5 letters. Must be 5 letters.

""BAYOU"" - B,A,Y,O,U -> A and O eliminated? From crane and moist? A and O both absent? Yes. So invalid.

So no.

Therefore, I'll guess ""BULKY"".

But note: in feedback, we'll get marks for any letter present. But since no letters are correct so far, we might get some hits.

So guess ""BULKY"".

But let's confirm: the word must be common. ""Bulky"" is a common word.

Alternative: ""PUDGY"" - also common.

I'll go with ""BULKY"".

So <guess>bulky</guess>

But in the response format, we just put the guess.

So, after thinking step by step.

Step-by-step:
- We eliminated 10 letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.
- Only B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z remain.
- We need a 5-letter word from these. 
- We considered words like ""glyph"", ""pudgy"", ""fudgy"", ""bulky"".
- Since U is an important vowel, we choose a word containing U like ""bulky"".We have two previous guesses with no correct letters:  
- ""crane"" had all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E  
- ""moist"" had all letters absent: M, O, I, S, T  

This eliminates 10 letters (C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T). The remaining available letters are:  
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

The secret word must be a 5-letter English word using only these letters. Since vowels A, E, I, O are eliminated, it's likely that U or Y acts as a vowel. Common words fitting this criteria include:

- ""pudgy"" (P, U, D, G, Y)  
- ""fudgy"" (F, U, D, G, Y)  
- ""glyph"" (G, L, Y, P, H)  

I choose ""bulky"" because:  
- It uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.  
- It contains U, which is a strong vowel candidate in the remaining letters.  
- B, L, K, Y are common consonants that could appear in the word.",Guess 3: bulky -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
