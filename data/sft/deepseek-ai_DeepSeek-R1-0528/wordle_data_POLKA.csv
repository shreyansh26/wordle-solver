We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get. 
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.

 Common starting words in Wordle include: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is: CRANE

We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Interpretation:
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (since it's marked with '-'). So A is present somewhere else.
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all (marked with 'x').

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the second position (since our A was in the second position and it's wrong). Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word. We must include the letter A (since we know it's in the word), but not in the second position. Also, we avoid using C, R, N, E.

Our goal is to test other common letters and positions.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but avoiding C,R,N,E).

We want to maximize information, so try a word with new letters and include A in a position other than the second.

Remember: A is in the word, so we must include it in our next guess? Actually, we should to confirm and get more data, but the rules don't force us. However, including known letters can help lock down positions.

But note: A cannot be in position 2, so put A in position 1,3,4, or 5.

Let me think of words without C,R,N,E that have A in a different position.

Possible words: 
- Starting with A? But then A would be in position 1. But we know A is in the word but not in position 2? It could be in position 1? Actually, the '-' means it's in the word but not in that position, so it could be anywhere else.

But note: in the feedback, A was in position 2 and was '-', so if we put A in position 1 and it's correct, that would be a different story.

But we don't know where A is.

Let me try to list words that have A and avoid C,R,N,E.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

Possible starting words: SALAD? But has two A's and we don't know about duplicates. Better to avoid duplicates for now.

Alternatively, SALTS? But that has S and T.

Actually, let's consider:
Words with A: such as ""SLATE"" -> but has E? E is excluded because E was marked 'x' in the first guess? Yes, E is not in the word.

First guess feedback: E(x) so E is not in the word.

Similarly, C,R,N,E are all out.

So we must avoid the letters: C, R, N, E.

Now, we must include A? Actually, we don't have to, but we know A is in the word so we should include it to figure out its position.

Therefore, we design a word that:
- Contains A (in a position other than the second)
- Uses new common letters: for example, S, T, L, O, P, I, etc.

One classic word is ""AUDIO"", but that has O and A. Does AUDIO avoid C,R,N,E? Yes.

But AUDIO: A in position 1, U, D, I, O.

But we don't know if U,D,I,O are in the word.

Alternatively, ""PASTA"" would have duplicates? P-A-S-T-A. Duplicate A? We don't know if the word has duplicates but for maximum information, avoiding duplicates might be better.

Given that we have 6 tries, let's choose a word with distinct new letters and A.

Consider: ""SAINT"" -> S,A,I,N,T -> but N is excluded (we know N is not in the word) because feedback N(x).

Similarly, ""NASTY"" -> N and E excluded? N and T? NASTY: N,A,S,T,Y -> but N is excluded.

So avoid N.

Another idea: ""SHALT"" -> S,H,A,L,T -> letters: S, H, A, L, T.

All distinct, and avoids C,R,N,E.

But ""SHALT"" might be archaic? In word games, it might be accepted. Let's choose a more common word.

Alternative: ""PLAID"" -> P,L,A,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E.

But PLAID has A in the third position? Let's see:

P (position1), L (2), A (3), I (4), D (5)

We know A is not in position 2? But here it's in position 3, which is safe.

Other common word: ""BASIC"" -> but has C? C is excluded.

Avoid C.

""DAILY"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> D is a new letter?

But DAILY: D (1), A (2) — wait, position 2! But in our first guess, A was in position 2 and got '-', meaning A is not in position 2. So we must not put A in position 2 again? Actually, we can put it again but that would be wasteful because we know it's not there. So put A in position 1,3,4, or 5.

DAILY has A in position 2? D is position 1, A position 2 — so we cannot use that.

We can put A in position 1: like ""ADULT""? But has U,L,T. But A in position1.

But ""ADULT"" has duplicates? A and T? Actually no duplicates? A,D,U,L,T — distinct.

But what about the letters: avoiding C,R,N,E? Yes.

But perhaps we can use ""SAUCY""? Has C? No, avoid C.

Option: ""STAMP"" -> S,T,A,M,P -> letters: S,T,A,M,P. Distinct? Yes. Avoids C,R,N,E.

A is in position 3? Positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), M(4), P(5).

This seems good: common word, distinct letters, avoids the excluded letters.

Another option: ""TOPAZ"" — less common.

So I'll go with ""STAMP"".

But note: we have to include A? We should, because we know it's in the word. So yes.

Therefore, second guess: STAMP

Now we return it in the required format.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- ""A"" is in the secret word but not in position 2 (since it received '-', indicating it's misplaced).
- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the secret word at all (since they received 'x').

For the second guess:
- Must include ""A"" (as it is confirmed in the word), but avoid placing it in position 2.
- Should avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"".
- Focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, M, P) to maximize information gain.
- Prefer a word without duplicate letters for efficient coverage.

A strong candidate is ""STAMP"":
- Puts ""A"" in position 3 (avoiding position 2).
- Uses new letters: S, T, M, P (all common, avoiding excluded letters).
- Valid English word with distinct letters.

Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.\n\nWe need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word. We must include the letter A (since we know it\'s in the word), but not in the second position. Also, we avoid using C, R, N, E.\n\nOur goal is to test other common letters and positions.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but avoiding C,R,N,E).\n\nWe want to maximize information, so try a word with new letters and include A in a position other than the second.\n\nRemember: A is in the word, so we must include it in our next guess?

But then A would be in position 1. But we know A is in the word but not in position 2? It could be in position 1? Actually, the \'-\' means it\'s in the word but not in that position, so it could be anywhere else.\n\nBut note: in the feedback, A was in position 2 and was \'-\', so if we put A in position 1 and it\'s correct, that would be a different story.\n\nBut we don\'t know where A is.\n\nLet me try to list words that have A and avoid C,R,N,E.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.\n\nPossible starting words: SALAD? But has two A\'s and we don\'t know about duplicates. Better to avoid duplicates for now.\n\nAlternatively, SALTS? But that has S and T.\n\nActually, let\'s consider:\nWords with A: such as ""SLATE"" -> but has E? E is excluded because E was marked \'x\' in the first guess? Yes, E is not in the word.\n\nFirst guess feedback: E(x) so E is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, C,R,N,E are all out.\n\nSo we must avoid the letters: C, R, N, E.\n\nNow, we must include A? Actually, we don\'t have to, but we know A is in the word so we should include it to figure out its position.\n\nTherefore, we design a word that:\n- Contains A (in a position other than the second)\n- Uses new common letters: for example, S, T, L, O, P, I, etc.\n\nOne classic word is ""AUDIO"", but that has O and A.

N and T? NASTY: N,A,S,T,Y -> but N is excluded.\n\nSo avoid N.\n\nAnother idea: ""SHALT"" -> S,H,A,L,T -> letters: S, H, A, L, T.\n\nAll distinct, and avoids C,R,N,E.\n\nBut ""SHALT"" might be archaic?

C is excluded.\n\nAvoid C.\n\n""DAILY"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> D is a new letter?\n\nBut DAILY: D (1), A (2) — wait, position 2! But in our first guess, A was in position 2 and got \'-\', meaning A is not in position 2. So we must not put A in position 2 again? Actually, we can put it again but that would be wasteful because we know it\'s not there. So put A in position 1,3,4, or 5.\n\nDAILY has A in position 2? D is position 1, A position 2 — so we cannot use that.\n\nWe can put A in position 1: like ""ADULT""? But has U,L,T. But A in position1.\n\nBut ""ADULT"" has duplicates? A and T? Actually no duplicates? A,D,U,L,T — distinct.\n\nBut what about the letters: avoiding C,R,N,E? Yes.\n\nBut perhaps we can use ""SAUCY""? Has C? No, avoid C.\n\nOption: ""STAMP"" -> S,T,A,M,P -> letters: S,T,A,M,P. Distinct? Yes. Avoids C,R,N,E.\n\nA is in position 3?

We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Second guess: STAMP
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position) — note: A was also misplaced in the first guess, so it's confirmed in the word but not in position 2 or 3 (since in STAMP, A is in position 3 and got '-')
- M: x (not in word)
- P: - (in word, wrong position)

So, from both guesses, we know:

Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, M

Letters that are in the word but misplaced: A and P

Specifically:
- A is in the word, but not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from STAMP). So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- P is in the word, but not in position 5 (from STAMP, since it was in position 5 and got '-'). So P must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Also, we have no other known letters.

Now, we need to make a third guess that:
- Must include A and P (since they are in the word, and we need to find their positions)
- Avoid the excluded letters: C, R, N, E, S, T, M
- We can use other letters that haven't been tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are common)

We also note that A cannot be in position 2 or 3, so we must place A in 1, 4, or 5.
P cannot be in position 5, so we place P in 1,2,3, or 4.

We want to test possible positions for A and P, and also test new letters.

Let's think of words that have both A and P, and avoid the excluded letters.

Possible positions for A: 1,4,5
Possible positions for P: 1,2,3,4

But note: if we put A in position 1, then P cannot be in 1 (unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, for now, we assume no duplicates to maximize information, unless necessary).

Similarly, if we put A in 4 and P in 4, that would be the same position, which is impossible. So we must avoid that.

So the positions for A and P must be different.

Possible combinations of (A_pos, P_pos):
- A in 1: then P can be in 2,3,4
- A in 4: then P can be in 1,2,3
- A in 5: then P can be in 1,2,3,4

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: A in position 1
- Then the word starts with A.
- P can be in 2,3,4.

Example: 
- If P in 2: A P _ _ _ 
  - Words: APPLE? But has E (excluded) and P repeated? Actually, APPLE has two P's? A, P, P, L, E -> but E excluded and duplicate P? Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But in feedback, we haven't seen duplicates, so avoid for now.
- If P in 3: A _ P _ _
  - Words: ADAPT? But has D and T? T is excluded (from STAMP, T is x). So T is out.
  - Avoid T? So not ADAPT.

We need to avoid S, T, M, etc.

Try A in 1 and P in 4: A _ _ P _
- Words: ALOUD? But no P. 
  - We need P in position 4: so A _ _ P _
- Possible: ALPHA? But has H and L, but also A repeated? A, L, P, H, A -> duplicate A? We don't know if A is duplicated? But in the feedback, we only know one A is present. It could be more? But to be safe, avoid duplicates.

Another: AMPLY? But A in 1, M in 2? But M is excluded (from STAMP, M is x). So no.

Option 2: A in position 4
- Then P can be in 1,2,3.

Example: P in 1 and A in 4: P _ _ A _
- Words: POPPA? Duplicate P and A? Not good.
  - Better: PULAS? Not a word.
  - How about: PUDGY? But no A. We need A in position 4: so P _ _ A _
  - Words: PIZZA? No A. 
  - Valid word: POKER? No A. 
  - We need a word with A in position 4: like OPERA? But O,P,E,R,A -> E and R are excluded. 
  - Avoid E and R.

So: P _ _ A _ and avoid C,R,N,E,S,T,M.

Possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,O,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Try: P _ _ A _
- How about: PUDAL? Not a word.
- Or: PAGOD? But A is in position 2? We need A in 4. PAGOD: P(1),A(2),G(3),O(4),D(5) -> A is in 2, but we need in 4.

We need A in 4: so the fourth letter is A.

So: P _ _ A _
- Words: 
  - ""POLKA"" -> P(1), O(2), L(3), K(4), A(5) -> but A is in 5, not 4. We need A in 4? 
  - Actually, for A in position 4: the fourth letter is A, so the word pattern: ? ? ? A ?

Example: ""DELTA"" but D,E,L,T,A -> E and T excluded.

Another: ""VODKA"" -> V,O,D,K,A -> A is in 5? Not 4.

Hard to find. Let's try A in 5.

Option 3: A in position 5
- Then P can be in 1,2,3,4.

Example: P in 1 and A in 5: P _ _ _ A
- Words: PIZZA? But no A in 5? P,I,Z,Z,A -> A in 5. But Z is not common. 
  - Better: PUPAL? Duplicate P? And A in 4? P,U,P,A,L -> A in 4, not 5.
- Words ending with A: like OPERA? But E and R excluded.
- Avoid excluded: so P _ _ _ A, with the middle three letters not C,R,N,E,S,T,M.

Possible: ""PAGED""? But E excluded? P,A,G,E,D -> E is excluded.

""PALED""? E excluded.

""POLKA"" -> P,O,L,K,A -> A in 5. And letters: P,O,L,K,A. 
- O, L, K are new. 
- But we have A in 5 and P in 1.

Is ""POLKA"" a word? Yes, it is.

But note: in POLKA, A is in 5 and P in 1. Also, we are testing O, L, K.

But we also have to consider that A cannot be in position 2 or 3, which is satisfied.

Another possibility: P in 2 and A in 5: _ P _ _ A
- Words: SPRAY? But S excluded. 
  - Without S: UPPER? Duplicate P and E excluded? 
  - APPAL? Duplicate P and A? 

P in 3 and A in 5: _ _ P _ A
- Words: ALPHA? A in 1? Not 5. 
  - HYPHA? Not common. 
  - TULPA? T excluded.

P in 4 and A in 5: _ _ _ P A
- Words: CAMPA? C excluded. 
  - GASPA? G,A,S,P,A -> duplicate A and S excluded? 
  - Better: ""GULPA""? Not a word. 
  - ""CARPA""? C excluded.

So ""POLKA"" seems a good candidate: P in 1, O in 2, L in 3, K in 4, A in 5.

But note: we are testing A in position 5 and P in position 1.

We also test O, L, K.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters: which we are (O, L, K not excluded yet).

Another word: ""PLACK""? But P in 1, L in 2, A in 3? But A cannot be in position 3 (from STAMP feedback, A in position 3 was wrong). So we cannot put A in 3.

In POLKA, A is in 5, which is allowed.

Another word: ""PODIA""? P in 1, O in 2, D in 3, I in 4, A in 5. Also good.

But ""PODIA"" is a word (plural of podium).

Similarly, ""POLKA"" and ""PODIA"" are both options.

But ""POLKA"" has K, which is less common? But it's valid.

Alternatively, ""PADDY""? But A in 2? We cannot put A in 2. PADDY: P,A,D,D,Y -> A in 2, which is forbidden (we know A is not in 2). So invalid.

So between ""POLKA"" and ""PODIA"", both are acceptable.

But we also have to consider that P is in the word and we are putting it in position 1. If P is actually in position 1, we get a 'correct' mark, which would be great. Similarly, if A is in 5, we get a correct mark.

But we don't know, so we are testing.

Another word: ""PULKA""? Not common.

I think ""PODIA"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters.

We haven't used L, I, O, D, etc.

In ""PODIA"": P, O, D, I, A -> all distinct, avoids excluded letters.

In ""POLKA"": P, O, L, K, A.

Both are fine.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any, so we assume no duplicates for now.

I'll go with ""PODIA"" because it uses I and D, which are common.

But let's confirm: we know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3, so in PODIA, A is in 5, which is a candidate.

P is in 1, which is a candidate position.

So, third guess: PODIA

But wait, we must ensure that we are not using any excluded letters. Excluded: C,R,N,E,S,T,M. PODIA: P,O,D,I,A — none of these are excluded.

So it's valid.

Another option: ""DAISY"" — but D,A,I,S,Y -> S is excluded? S is in the excluded list (from STAMP, S is x). So no.

So PODIA is good.

But let me see if there's a word that can test more positions.

We know A can be in 1,4,5. In PODIA, we are testing A in 5.

We know P can be in 1,2,3,4. In PODIA, we are testing P in 1.

We are also testing O in 2, D in 3, I in 4.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we could put A in position 1 and P in position 4, for example.

Word: A _ _ P _

With A in 1 and P in 4: A _ _ P _

Avoid excluded letters.

Possible: ""ADOPT"" -> A,D,O,P,T -> but T is excluded? From STAMP, T is x. So no.

""ALPHA"" -> A,L,P,H,A -> duplicate A? And A in 1 and 5? But we are putting A in 1 and then again in 5? The word has two A's? But we don't know. Also, in ALPHA, P is in 3? We are putting P in 3? But we want P in 4? ALPHA: A(1), L(2), P(3), H(4), A(5) -> so P is in 3, not 4.

We want P in 4: so A _ _ P _

Like: A D U P T? Not a word.

A G A P E? E excluded and duplicate A.

Hard to find.

Another: A W A P ? Duplicate A.

So perhaps PODIA is a reasonable choice.

I think we should go with ""PODIA"".

But let me check: is ""PODIA"" accepted in Wordle? It should be, as it's a valid English word (plural of podium).

So, third guess: PODIA

Now, in the response format.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
     - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → A is in the word but not in position 2. C, R, N, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (STAMP)**:
     - S(x), T(x), A(-), M(x), P(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was misplaced again). P is in the word but not in position 5. S, T, M are absent.
   - **Summary**:
     - **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, S, T, M (cannot be used).
     - **Present Letters**: A and P are confirmed in the word.
     - **Position Constraints for A**: Cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE) or 3 (from STAMP), so must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
     - **Position Constraints for P**: Cannot be in position 5 (from STAMP), so must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

2. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Must include both A and P to test their positions, as they are confirmed present.
   - Avoid all absent letters (C, R, N, E, S, T, M).
   - Use new common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., D, I, O, L, K, etc.).
   - Prefer distinct letters to cover more ground (no duplicates).
   - Test feasible positions for A and P:
     - A in 1, 4, or 5; P in 1, 2, 3, or 4.
     - Avoid conflicting positions (e.g., if A is in 1, P cannot be in 1 unless duplicated, but duplicates are avoided for now).

3. **Word Selection**:
   - Considered options like ""POLKA"" (P in 1, A in 5) and ""PODIA"" (P in 1, A in 5). Both fit constraints and use new letters.
   - ""PODIA"" (valid English word, plural of ""podium"") is chosen because:
     - P is tested in position 1.
     - A is tested in position 5 (a valid candidate position).
     - Uses new common letters: O (position 2), D (position 3), I (position 4).
     - Avoids all excluded letters and has no duplicates.
     - Provides good coverage of untested letters (D, I, O) and helps narrow down positions for A and P.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If P is in position 1, it will show as correct (✓).
   - If A is in position 5, it will show as correct (✓).
   - Feedback on O, D, I will reveal if they are present and in the right positions, further reducing possibilities.

<guess>podia</guess>",podia,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Second guess: STAMP
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position) — note: A was also misplaced in the first guess, so it's confirmed in the word but not in position 2 or 3 (since in STAMP, A is in position 3 and got '-')
- M: x (not in word)
- P: - (in word, wrong position)

So, from both guesses, we know:

Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, M

Letters that are in the word but misplaced: A and P

Specifically:
- A is in the word, but not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from STAMP). So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- P is in the word, but not in position 5 (from STAMP, since it was in position 5 and got '-'). So P must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Also, we have no other known letters.

Now, we need to make a third guess that:
- Must include A and P (since they are in the word, and we need to find their positions)
- Avoid the excluded letters: C, R, N, E, S, T, M
- We can use other letters that haven't been tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are common)

We also note that A cannot be in position 2 or 3, so we must place A in 1, 4, or 5.
P cannot be in position 5, so we place P in 1,2,3, or 4.

We want to test possible positions for A and P, and also test new letters.

Let's think of words that have both A and P, and avoid the excluded letters.

Possible positions for A: 1,4,5
Possible positions for P: 1,2,3,4

But note: if we put A in position 1, then P cannot be in 1 (unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, for now, we assume no duplicates to maximize information, unless necessary).

Similarly, if we put A in 4 and P in 4, that would be the same position, which is impossible. So we must avoid that.

So the positions for A and P must be different.

Possible combinations of (A_pos, P_pos):
- A in 1: then P can be in 2,3,4
- A in 4: then P can be in 1,2,3
- A in 5: then P can be in 1,2,3,4

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: A in position 1
- Then the word starts with A.
- P can be in 2,3,4.

Example: 
- If P in 2: A P _ _ _ 
  - Words: APPLE? But has E (excluded) and P repeated? Actually, APPLE has two P's? A, P, P, L, E -> but E excluded and duplicate P? Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But in feedback, we haven't seen duplicates, so avoid for now.
- If P in 3: A _ P _ _
  - Words: ADAPT? But has D and T? T is excluded (from STAMP, T is x). So T is out.
  - Avoid T? So not ADAPT.

We need to avoid S, T, M, etc.

Try A in 1 and P in 4: A _ _ P _
- Words: ALOUD? But no P. 
  - We need P in position 4: so A _ _ P _
- Possible: ALPHA? But has H and L, but also A repeated? A, L, P, H, A -> duplicate A? We don't know if A is duplicated? But in the feedback, we only know one A is present. It could be more? But to be safe, avoid duplicates.

Another: AMPLY? But A in 1, M in 2? But M is excluded (from STAMP, M is x). So no.

Option 2: A in position 4
- Then P can be in 1,2,3.

Example: P in 1 and A in 4: P _ _ A _
- Words: POPPA? Duplicate P and A? Not good.
  - Better: PULAS? Not a word.
  - How about: PUDGY? But no A. We need A in position 4: so P _ _ A _

  - Valid word: POKER? No A. 
  - We need a word with A in position 4: like OPERA? But O,P,E,R,A -> E and R are excluded. 
  - Avoid E and R.

Try: P _ _ A _
- How about: PUDAL? Not a word.
- Or: PAGOD? But A is in position 2? We need A in 4. PAGOD: P(1),A(2),G(3),O(4),D(5) -> A is in 2, but we need in 4.

We need A in 4: so the fourth letter is A.

So: P _ _ A _
- Words: 
  - ""POLKA"" -> P(1), O(2), L(3), K(4), A(5) -> but A is in 5, not 4. We need A in 4? 
  - Actually, for A in position 4: the fourth letter is A, so the word pattern: ? ? ? A ?

Example: ""DELTA"" but D,E,L,T,A -> E and T excluded.

Another: ""VODKA"" -> V,O,D,K,A -> A is in 5? Not 4.

Hard to find. Let's try A in 5.

Option 3: A in position 5
- Then P can be in 1,2,3,4.

Example: P in 1 and A in 5: P _ _ _ A
- Words: PIZZA? But no A in 5? P,I,Z,Z,A -> A in 5. But Z is not common. 
  - Better: PUPAL? Duplicate P? And A in 4? P,U,P,A,L -> A in 4, not 5.
- Words ending with A: like OPERA? But E and R excluded.
- Avoid excluded: so P _ _ _ A, with the middle three letters not C,R,N,E,S,T,M.

Possible: ""PAGED""? But E excluded? P,A,G,E,D -> E is excluded.

""PALED""? E excluded.

""POLKA"" -> P,O,L,K,A -> A in 5. And letters: P,O,L,K,A. 
- O, L, K are new. 
- But we have A in 5 and P in 1.

Is ""POLKA"" a word? Yes, it is.

But note: in POLKA, A is in 5 and P in 1. Also, we are testing O, L, K.

But we also have to consider that A cannot be in position 2 or 3, which is satisfied.

Another possibility: P in 2 and A in 5: _ P _ _ A
- Words: SPRAY? But S excluded. 
  - Without S: UPPER? Duplicate P and E excluded? 
  - APPAL? Duplicate P and A? 

P in 3 and A in 5: _ _ P _ A
- Words: ALPHA? A in 1? Not 5. 
  - HYPHA? Not common. 
  - TULPA? T excluded.

P in 4 and A in 5: _ _ _ P A
- Words: CAMPA? C excluded. 
  - GASPA? G,A,S,P,A -> duplicate A and S excluded? 
  - Better: ""GULPA""? Not a word. 
  - ""CARPA""? C excluded.

So ""POLKA"" seems a good candidate: P in 1, O in 2, L in 3, K in 4, A in 5.

But note: we are testing A in position 5 and P in position 1.

We also test O, L, K.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters: which we are (O, L, K not excluded yet).

Another word: ""PLACK""? But P in 1, L in 2, A in 3? But A cannot be in position 3 (from STAMP feedback, A in position 3 was wrong). So we cannot put A in 3.

In POLKA, A is in 5, which is allowed.

Another word: ""PODIA""? P in 1, O in 2, D in 3, I in 4, A in 5. Also good.

But ""PODIA"" is a word (plural of podium).

Similarly, ""POLKA"" and ""PODIA"" are both options.

But ""POLKA"" has K, which is less common? But it's valid.

Alternatively, ""PADDY""? But A in 2? We cannot put A in 2. PADDY: P,A,D,D,Y -> A in 2, which is forbidden (we know A is not in 2). So invalid.

So between ""POLKA"" and ""PODIA"", both are acceptable.

But we also have to consider that P is in the word and we are putting it in position 1. If P is actually in position 1, we get a 'correct' mark, which would be great. Similarly, if A is in 5, we get a correct mark.

But we don't know, so we are testing.

Another word: ""PULKA""? Not common.

I think ""PODIA"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters.

We haven't used L, I, O, D, etc.

In ""PODIA"": P, O, D, I, A -> all distinct, avoids excluded letters.

In ""POLKA"": P, O, L, K, A.

Both are fine.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any, so we assume no duplicates for now.

I'll go with ""PODIA"" because it uses I and D, which are common.

But let's confirm: we know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3, so in PODIA, A is in 5, which is a candidate.

P is in 1, which is a candidate position.

So, third guess: PODIA

But wait, we must ensure that we are not using any excluded letters. Excluded: C,R,N,E,S,T,M. PODIA: P,O,D,I,A — none of these are excluded.

So it's valid.

Another option: ""DAISY"" — but D,A,I,S,Y -> S is excluded? S is in the excluded list (from STAMP, S is x). So no.

So PODIA is good.

But let me see if there's a word that can test more positions.

We know A can be in 1,4,5. In PODIA, we are testing A in 5.

We know P can be in 1,2,3,4. In PODIA, we are testing P in 1.

We are also testing O in 2, D in 3, I in 4.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we could put A in position 1 and P in position 4, for example.

Word: A _ _ P _

With A in 1 and P in 4: A _ _ P _

Avoid excluded letters.

Possible: ""ADOPT"" -> A,D,O,P,T -> but T is excluded? From STAMP, T is x. So no.

""ALPHA"" -> A,L,P,H,A -> duplicate A? And A in 1 and 5? But we are putting A in 1 and then again in 5? The word has two A's? But we don't know. Also, in ALPHA, P is in 3? We are putting P in 3? But we want P in 4? ALPHA: A(1), L(2), P(3), H(4), A(5) -> so P is in 3, not 4.

We want P in 4: so A _ _ P _

Like: A D U P T? Not a word.

A G A P E? E excluded and duplicate A.

Hard to find.

Another: A W A P ? Duplicate A.

So perhaps PODIA is a reasonable choice.

I think we should go with ""PODIA"".

But let me check: is ""PODIA"" accepted in Wordle? It should be, as it's a valid English word (plural of podium).

So, third guess: PODIA

Now, in the response format.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
     - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → A is in the word but not in position 2. C, R, N, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (STAMP)**:
     - S(x), T(x), A(-), M(x), P(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was misplaced again). P is in the word but not in position 5. S, T, M are absent.
   - **Summary**:
     - **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, S, T, M (cannot be used).
     - **Present Letters**: A and P are confirmed in the word.
     - **Position Constraints for A**: Cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE) or 3 (from STAMP), so must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
     - **Position Constraints for P**: Cannot be in position 5 (from STAMP), so must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

2. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Must include both A and P to test their positions, as they are confirmed present.
   - Avoid all absent letters (C, R, N, E, S, T, M).
   - Use new common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., D, I, O, L, K, etc.).
   - Prefer distinct letters to cover more ground (no duplicates).
   - Test feasible positions for A and P:
     - A in 1, 4, or 5; P in 1, 2, 3, or 4.
     - Avoid conflicting positions (e.g., if A is in 1, P cannot be in 1 unless duplicated, but duplicates are avoided for now).

3. **Word Selection**:
   - Considered options like ""POLKA"" (P in 1, A in 5) and ""PODIA"" (P in 1, A in 5). Both fit constraints and use new letters.
   - ""PODIA"" (valid English word, plural of ""podium"") is chosen because:
     - P is tested in position 1.
     - A is tested in position 5 (a valid candidate position).
     - Uses new common letters: O (position 2), D (position 3), I (position 4).
     - Avoids all excluded letters and has no duplicates.
     - Provides good coverage of untested letters (D, I, O) and helps narrow down positions for A and P.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If P is in position 1, it will show as correct (✓).
   - If A is in position 5, it will show as correct (✓).
   - Feedback on O, D, I will reveal if they are present and in the right positions, further reducing possibilities.",Guess 3: podia -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) D(x) I(x) A(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get. 
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.

 Common starting words in Wordle include: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Interpretation:
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (since it's marked with '-'). So A is present somewhere else.
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all (marked with 'x').

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the second position (since our A was in the second position and it's wrong). Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word. We must include the letter A (since we know it's in the word), but not in the second position. Also, we avoid using C, R, N, E.

Our goal is to test other common letters and positions.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but avoiding C,R,N,E).

We want to maximize information, so try a word with new letters and include A in a position other than the second.

Remember: A is in the word, so we must include it in our next guess? Actually, we should to confirm and get more data, but the rules don't force us. However, including known letters can help lock down positions.

But note: A cannot be in position 2, so put A in position 1,3,4, or 5.

Let me think of words without C,R,N,E that have A in a different position.

Possible words: 
- Starting with A? But then A would be in position 1. But we know A is in the word but not in position 2? It could be in position 1? Actually, the '-' means it's in the word but not in that position, so it could be anywhere else.

But note: in the feedback, A was in position 2 and was '-', so if we put A in position 1 and it's correct, that would be a different story.

But we don't know where A is.

Let me try to list words that have A and avoid C,R,N,E.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

Possible starting words: SALAD? But has two A's and we don't know about duplicates. Better to avoid duplicates for now.

Alternatively, SALTS? But that has S and T.

Actually, let's consider:
Words with A: such as ""SLATE"" -> but has E? E is excluded because E was marked 'x' in the first guess? Yes, E is not in the word.

First guess feedback: E(x) so E is not in the word.

Similarly, C,R,N,E are all out.

So we must avoid the letters: C, R, N, E.

Now, we must include A? Actually, we don't have to, but we know A is in the word so we should include it to figure out its position.

Therefore, we design a word that:
- Contains A (in a position other than the second)
- Uses new common letters: for example, S, T, L, O, P, I, etc.

One classic word is ""AUDIO"", but that has O and A. Does AUDIO avoid C,R,N,E? Yes.

But AUDIO: A in position 1, U, D, I, O.

But we don't know if U,D,I,O are in the word.

Alternatively, ""PASTA"" would have duplicates? P-A-S-T-A. Duplicate A? We don't know if the word has duplicates but for maximum information, avoiding duplicates might be better.

Given that we have 6 tries, let's choose a word with distinct new letters and A.

Consider: ""SAINT"" -> S,A,I,N,T -> but N is excluded (we know N is not in the word) because feedback N(x).

Similarly, ""NASTY"" -> N and E excluded? N and T? NASTY: N,A,S,T,Y -> but N is excluded.

So avoid N.

Another idea: ""SHALT"" -> S,H,A,L,T -> letters: S, H, A, L, T.

All distinct, and avoids C,R,N,E.

But ""SHALT"" might be archaic? In word games, it might be accepted. Let's choose a more common word.

Alternative: ""PLAID"" -> P,L,A,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E.

But PLAID has A in the third position? Let's see:

P (position1), L (2), A (3), I (4), D (5)

We know A is not in position 2? But here it's in position 3, which is safe.

Other common word: ""BASIC"" -> but has C? C is excluded.

Avoid C.

""DAILY"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> D is a new letter?

But DAILY: D (1), A (2) — wait, position 2! But in our first guess, A was in position 2 and got '-', meaning A is not in position 2. So we must not put A in position 2 again? Actually, we can put it again but that would be wasteful because we know it's not there. So put A in position 1,3,4, or 5.

DAILY has A in position 2? D is position 1, A position 2 — so we cannot use that.

We can put A in position 1: like ""ADULT""? But has U,L,T. But A in position1.

But ""ADULT"" has duplicates? A and T? Actually no duplicates? A,D,U,L,T — distinct.

But what about the letters: avoiding C,R,N,E? Yes.

But perhaps we can use ""SAUCY""? Has C? No, avoid C.

Option: ""STAMP"" -> S,T,A,M,P -> letters: S,T,A,M,P. Distinct? Yes. Avoids C,R,N,E.

A is in position 3? Positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), M(4), P(5).

This seems good: common word, distinct letters, avoids the excluded letters.

Another option: ""TOPAZ"" — less common.

So I'll go with ""STAMP"".

But note: we have to include A? We should, because we know it's in the word. So yes.

Therefore, second guess: STAMP

Now we return it in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- ""A"" is in the secret word but not in position 2 (since it received '-', indicating it's misplaced).
- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the secret word at all (since they received 'x').

For the second guess:
- Must include ""A"" (as it is confirmed in the word), but avoid placing it in position 2.
- Should avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"".
- Focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, M, P) to maximize information gain.
- Prefer a word without duplicate letters for efficient coverage.

A strong candidate is ""STAMP"":
- Puts ""A"" in position 3 (avoiding position 2).
- Uses new letters: S, T, M, P (all common, avoiding excluded letters).
- Valid English word with distinct letters.

<guess>stamp</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) M(x) P(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Second guess: STAMP
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position) — note: A was also misplaced in the first guess, so it's confirmed in the word but not in position 2 or 3 (since in STAMP, A is in position 3 and got '-')
- M: x (not in word)
- P: - (in word, wrong position)

So, from both guesses, we know:

Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, M

Letters that are in the word but misplaced: A and P

Specifically:
- A is in the word, but not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from STAMP). So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- P is in the word, but not in position 5 (from STAMP, since it was in position 5 and got '-'). So P must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Also, we have no other known letters.

Now, we need to make a third guess that:
- Must include A and P (since they are in the word, and we need to find their positions)
- Avoid the excluded letters: C, R, N, E, S, T, M
- We can use other letters that haven't been tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are common)

We also note that A cannot be in position 2 or 3, so we must place A in 1, 4, or 5.
P cannot be in position 5, so we place P in 1,2,3, or 4.

We want to test possible positions for A and P, and also test new letters.

Let's think of words that have both A and P, and avoid the excluded letters.

Possible positions for A: 1,4,5
Possible positions for P: 1,2,3,4

But note: if we put A in position 1, then P cannot be in 1 (unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, for now, we assume no duplicates to maximize information, unless necessary).

Similarly, if we put A in 4 and P in 4, that would be the same position, which is impossible. So we must avoid that.

So the positions for A and P must be different.

Possible combinations of (A_pos, P_pos):
- A in 1: then P can be in 2,3,4
- A in 4: then P can be in 1,2,3
- A in 5: then P can be in 1,2,3,4

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: A in position 1
- Then the word starts with A.
- P can be in 2,3,4.

Example: 
- If P in 2: A P _ _ _ 
  - Words: APPLE? But has E (excluded) and P repeated? Actually, APPLE has two P's? A, P, P, L, E -> but E excluded and duplicate P? Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But in feedback, we haven't seen duplicates, so avoid for now.
- If P in 3: A _ P _ _
  - Words: ADAPT? But has D and T? T is excluded (from STAMP, T is x). So T is out.
  - Avoid T? So not ADAPT.

We need to avoid S, T, M, etc.

Try A in 1 and P in 4: A _ _ P _
- Words: ALOUD? But no P. 
  - We need P in position 4: so A _ _ P _
- Possible: ALPHA? But has H and L, but also A repeated? A, L, P, H, A -> duplicate A? We don't know if A is duplicated? But in the feedback, we only know one A is present. It could be more? But to be safe, avoid duplicates.

Another: AMPLY? But A in 1, M in 2? But M is excluded (from STAMP, M is x). So no.

Option 2: A in position 4
- Then P can be in 1,2,3.

Example: P in 1 and A in 4: P _ _ A _
- Words: POPPA? Duplicate P and A? Not good.
  - Better: PULAS? Not a word.
  - How about: PUDGY? But no A. We need A in position 4: so P _ _ A _
  - Words: PIZZA? No A. 
  - Valid word: POKER? No A. 
  - We need a word with A in position 4: like OPERA? But O,P,E,R,A -> E and R are excluded. 
  - Avoid E and R.

So: P _ _ A _ and avoid C,R,N,E,S,T,M.

Possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,O,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Try: P _ _ A _
- How about: PUDAL? Not a word.
- Or: PAGOD? But A is in position 2? We need A in 4. PAGOD: P(1),A(2),G(3),O(4),D(5) -> A is in 2, but we need in 4.

We need A in 4: so the fourth letter is A.

So: P _ _ A _
- Words: 
  - ""POLKA"" -> P(1), O(2), L(3), K(4), A(5) -> but A is in 5, not 4. We need A in 4? 
  - Actually, for A in position 4: the fourth letter is A, so the word pattern: ? ? ? A ?

Example: ""DELTA"" but D,E,L,T,A -> E and T excluded.

Another: ""VODKA"" -> V,O,D,K,A -> A is in 5? Not 4.

Hard to find. Let's try A in 5.

Option 3: A in position 5
- Then P can be in 1,2,3,4.

Example: P in 1 and A in 5: P _ _ _ A
- Words: PIZZA? But no A in 5? P,I,Z,Z,A -> A in 5. But Z is not common. 
  - Better: PUPAL? Duplicate P? And A in 4? P,U,P,A,L -> A in 4, not 5.
- Words ending with A: like OPERA? But E and R excluded.
- Avoid excluded: so P _ _ _ A, with the middle three letters not C,R,N,E,S,T,M.

Possible: ""PAGED""? But E excluded? P,A,G,E,D -> E is excluded.

""PALED""? E excluded.

""POLKA"" -> P,O,L,K,A -> A in 5. And letters: P,O,L,K,A. 
- O, L, K are new. 
- But we have A in 5 and P in 1.

Is ""POLKA"" a word? Yes, it is.

But note: in POLKA, A is in 5 and P in 1. Also, we are testing O, L, K.

But we also have to consider that A cannot be in position 2 or 3, which is satisfied.

Another possibility: P in 2 and A in 5: _ P _ _ A
- Words: SPRAY? But S excluded. 
  - Without S: UPPER? Duplicate P and E excluded? 
  - APPAL? Duplicate P and A? 

P in 3 and A in 5: _ _ P _ A
- Words: ALPHA? A in 1? Not 5. 
  - HYPHA? Not common. 
  - TULPA? T excluded.

P in 4 and A in 5: _ _ _ P A
- Words: CAMPA? C excluded. 
  - GASPA? G,A,S,P,A -> duplicate A and S excluded? 
  - Better: ""GULPA""? Not a word. 
  - ""CARPA""? C excluded.

So ""POLKA"" seems a good candidate: P in 1, O in 2, L in 3, K in 4, A in 5.

But note: we are testing A in position 5 and P in position 1.

We also test O, L, K.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters: which we are (O, L, K not excluded yet).

Another word: ""PLACK""? But P in 1, L in 2, A in 3? But A cannot be in position 3 (from STAMP feedback, A in position 3 was wrong). So we cannot put A in 3.

In POLKA, A is in 5, which is allowed.

Another word: ""PODIA""? P in 1, O in 2, D in 3, I in 4, A in 5. Also good.

But ""PODIA"" is a word (plural of podium).

Similarly, ""POLKA"" and ""PODIA"" are both options.

But ""POLKA"" has K, which is less common? But it's valid.

Alternatively, ""PADDY""? But A in 2? We cannot put A in 2. PADDY: P,A,D,D,Y -> A in 2, which is forbidden (we know A is not in 2). So invalid.

So between ""POLKA"" and ""PODIA"", both are acceptable.

But we also have to consider that P is in the word and we are putting it in position 1. If P is actually in position 1, we get a 'correct' mark, which would be great. Similarly, if A is in 5, we get a correct mark.

But we don't know, so we are testing.

Another word: ""PULKA""? Not common.

I think ""PODIA"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters.

We haven't used L, I, O, D, etc.

In ""PODIA"": P, O, D, I, A -> all distinct, avoids excluded letters.

In ""POLKA"": P, O, L, K, A.

Both are fine.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any, so we assume no duplicates for now.

I'll go with ""PODIA"" because it uses I and D, which are common.

But let's confirm: we know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3, so in PODIA, A is in 5, which is a candidate.

P is in 1, which is a candidate position.

So, third guess: PODIA

But wait, we must ensure that we are not using any excluded letters. Excluded: C,R,N,E,S,T,M. PODIA: P,O,D,I,A — none of these are excluded.

So it's valid.

Another option: ""DAISY"" — but D,A,I,S,Y -> S is excluded? S is in the excluded list (from STAMP, S is x). So no.

So PODIA is good.

But let me see if there's a word that can test more positions.

We know A can be in 1,4,5. In PODIA, we are testing A in 5.

We know P can be in 1,2,3,4. In PODIA, we are testing P in 1.

We are also testing O in 2, D in 3, I in 4.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we could put A in position 1 and P in position 4, for example.

Word: A _ _ P _

With A in 1 and P in 4: A _ _ P _

Avoid excluded letters.

Possible: ""ADOPT"" -> A,D,O,P,T -> but T is excluded? From STAMP, T is x. So no.

""ALPHA"" -> A,L,P,H,A -> duplicate A? And A in 1 and 5? But we are putting A in 1 and then again in 5? The word has two A's? But we don't know. Also, in ALPHA, P is in 3? We are putting P in 3? But we want P in 4? ALPHA: A(1), L(2), P(3), H(4), A(5) -> so P is in 3, not 4.

We want P in 4: so A _ _ P _

Like: A D U P T? Not a word.

A G A P E? E excluded and duplicate A.

Hard to find.

Another: A W A P ? Duplicate A.

So perhaps PODIA is a reasonable choice.

I think we should go with ""PODIA"".

But let me check: is ""PODIA"" accepted in Wordle? It should be, as it's a valid English word (plural of podium).

So, third guess: PODIA

Now, in the response format.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
     - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → A is in the word but not in position 2. C, R, N, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (STAMP)**:
     - S(x), T(x), A(-), M(x), P(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was misplaced again). P is in the word but not in position 5. S, T, M are absent.
   - **Summary**:
     - **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, S, T, M (cannot be used).
     - **Present Letters**: A and P are confirmed in the word.
     - **Position Constraints for A**: Cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE) or 3 (from STAMP), so must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
     - **Position Constraints for P**: Cannot be in position 5 (from STAMP), so must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

2. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Must include both A and P to test their positions, as they are confirmed present.
   - Avoid all absent letters (C, R, N, E, S, T, M).
   - Use new common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., D, I, O, L, K, etc.).
   - Prefer distinct letters to cover more ground (no duplicates).
   - Test feasible positions for A and P:
     - A in 1, 4, or 5; P in 1, 2, 3, or 4.
     - Avoid conflicting positions (e.g., if A is in 1, P cannot be in 1 unless duplicated, but duplicates are avoided for now).

3. **Word Selection**:
   - Considered options like ""POLKA"" (P in 1, A in 5) and ""PODIA"" (P in 1, A in 5). Both fit constraints and use new letters.
   - ""PODIA"" (valid English word, plural of ""podium"") is chosen because:
     - P is tested in position 1.
     - A is tested in position 5 (a valid candidate position).
     - Uses new common letters: O (position 2), D (position 3), I (position 4).
     - Avoids all excluded letters and has no duplicates.
     - Provides good coverage of untested letters (D, I, O) and helps narrow down positions for A and P.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If P is in position 1, it will show as correct (✓).
   - If A is in position 5, it will show as correct (✓).
   - Feedback on O, D, I will reveal if they are present and in the right positions, further reducing possibilities.

So A is present somewhere else.\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all (marked with \'x\').\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the second position (since our A was in the second position and it\'s wrong). Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.\n\nWe need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word. We must include the letter A (since we know it\'s in the word), but not in the second position. Also, we avoid using C, R, N, E.\n\nOur goal is to test other common letters and positions.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but avoiding C,R,N,E).\n\nWe want to maximize information, so try a word with new letters and include A in a position other than the second.\n\nRemember: A is in the word, so we must include it in our next guess? Actually, we should to confirm and get more data, but the rules don\'t force us. However, including known letters can help lock down positions.\n\nBut note: A cannot be in position 2, so put A in position 1,3,4, or 5.\n\nLet me think of words without C,R,N,E that have A in a different position.\n\nPossible words: \n- Starting with A? But then A would be in position 1. But we know A is in the word but not in position 2? It could be in position 1? Actually, the \'-\' means it\'s in the word but not in that position, so it could be anywhere else.\n\nBut note: in the feedback, A was in position 2 and was \'-\', so if we put A in position 1 and it\'s correct, that would be a different story.\n\nBut we don\'t know where A is.\n\nLet me try to list words that have A and avoid C,R,N,E.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.\n\nPossible starting words: SALAD? But has two A\'s and we don\'t know about duplicates. Better to avoid duplicates for now.\n\nAlternatively, SALTS? But that has S and T.\n\nActually, let\'s consider:\nWords with A: such as ""SLATE"" -> but has E? E is excluded because E was marked \'x\' in the first guess? Yes, E is not in the word.\n\nFirst guess feedback: E(x) so E is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, C,R,N,E are all out.\n\nSo we must avoid the letters: C, R, N, E.\n\nNow, we must include A? Actually, we don\'t have to, but we know A is in the word so we should include it to figure out its position.\n\nTherefore, we design a word that:\n- Contains A (in a position other than the second)\n- Uses new common letters: for example, S, T, L, O, P, I, etc.\n\nOne classic word is ""AUDIO"", but that has O and A. Does AUDIO avoid C,R,N,E? Yes.\n\nBut AUDIO: A in position 1, U, D, I, O.\n\nBut we don\'t know if U,D,I,O are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, ""PASTA"" would have duplicates? P-A-S-T-A. Duplicate A? We don\'t know if the word has duplicates but for maximum information, avoiding duplicates might be better.\n\nGiven that we have 6 tries, let\'s choose a word with distinct new letters and A.\n\nConsider: ""SAINT"" -> S,A,I,N,T -> but N is excluded (we know N is not in the word) because feedback N(x).\n\nSimilarly, ""NASTY"" -> N and E excluded? N and T? NASTY: N,A,S,T,Y -> but N is excluded.\n\nSo avoid N.\n\nAnother idea: ""SHALT"" -> S,H,A,L,T -> letters: S, H, A, L, T.\n\nAll distinct, and avoids C,R,N,E.\n\nBut ""SHALT"" might be archaic? In word games, it might be accepted. Let\'s choose a more common word.\n\nAlternative: ""PLAID"" -> P,L,A,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E.\n\nBut PLAID has A in the third position? Let\'s see:\n\nP (position1), L (2), A (3), I (4), D (5)\n\nWe know A is not in position 2? But here it\'s in position 3, which is safe.\n\nOther common word: ""BASIC"" -> but has C? C is excluded.\n\nAvoid C.\n\n""DAILY"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> D is a new letter?\n\nBut DAILY: D (1), A (2) — wait, position 2! But in our first guess, A was in position 2 and got \'-\', meaning A is not in position 2. So we must not put A in position 2 again? Actually, we can put it again but that would be wasteful because we know it\'s not there. So put A in position 1,3,4, or 5.\n\nDAILY has A in position 2? D is position 1, A position 2 — so we cannot use that.\n\nWe can put A in position 1: like ""ADULT""? But has U,L,T. But A in position1.\n\nBut ""ADULT"" has duplicates? A and T? Actually no duplicates? A,D,U,L,T — distinct.\n\nBut what about the letters: avoiding C,R,N,E? Yes.\n\nBut perhaps we can use ""SAUCY""? Has C? No, avoid C.\n\nOption: ""STAMP"" -> S,T,A,M,P -> letters: S,T,A,M,P. Distinct? Yes. Avoids C,R,N,E.\n\nA is in position 3? Positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), M(4), P(5).\n\nThis seems good: common word, distinct letters, avoids the excluded letters.\n\nAnother option: ""TOPAZ"" — less common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""STAMP"".\n\nBut note: we have to include A? We should, because we know it\'s in the word. So yes.\n\nTherefore, second guess: STAMP\n\nNow we return it in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- ""A"" is in the secret word but not in position 2 (since it received \'-\', indicating it\'s misplaced).\n- ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the secret word at all (since they received \'x\').\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include ""A"" (as it is confirmed in the word), but avoid placing it in position 2.\n- Should avoid using ""C"", ""R"", ""N"", and ""E"".\n- Focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, M, P) to maximize information gain.\n- Prefer a word without duplicate letters for efficient coverage.\n\nA strong candidate is ""STAMP"":\n- Puts ""A"" in position 3 (avoiding position 2).\n- Uses new letters: S, T, M, P (all common, avoiding excluded letters).\n- Valid English word with distinct letters.\n\n<guess>stamp</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) M(x) P(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: CRANE\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: x (not in word)\n- A: - (in word, wrong position)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nSecond guess: STAMP\n- S: x (not in word)\n- T: x (not in word)\n- A: - (in word, wrong position) — note: A was also misplaced in the first guess, so it\'s confirmed in the word but not in position 2 or 3 (since in STAMP, A is in position 3 and got \'-\')\n- M: x (not in word)\n- P: - (in word, wrong position)\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\nLetters not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, M\n\nLetters that are in the word but misplaced: A and P\n\nSpecifically:\n- A is in the word, but not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from STAMP). So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n- P is in the word, but not in position 5 (from STAMP, since it was in position 5 and got \'-\'). So P must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nAlso, we have no other known letters.\n\nNow, we need to make a third guess that:\n- Must include A and P (since they are in the word, and we need to find their positions)\n- Avoid the excluded letters: C, R, N, E, S, T, M\n- We can use other letters that haven\'t been tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are common)\n\nWe also note that A cannot be in position 2 or 3, so we must place A in 1, 4, or 5.\nP cannot be in position 5, so we place P in 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nWe want to test possible positions for A and P, and also test new letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have both A and P, and avoid the excluded letters.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1,4,5\nPossible positions for P: 1,2,3,4\n\nBut note: if we put A in position 1, then P cannot be in 1 (unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, for now, we assume no duplicates to maximize information, unless necessary).\n\nSimilarly, if we put A in 4 and P in 4, that would be the same position, which is impossible. So we must avoid that.\n\nSo the positions for A and P must be different.\n\nPossible combinations of (A_pos, P_pos):\n- A in 1: then P can be in 2,3,4\n- A in 4: then P can be in 1,2,3\n- A in 5: then P can be in 1,2,3,4\n\nWe also need to fill the other positions with new letters.\n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nOption 1: A in position 1\n- Then the word starts with A.\n- P can be in 2,3,4.\n\nExample: \n- If P in 2: A P _ _ _ \n  - Words: APPLE? But has E (excluded) and P repeated? Actually, APPLE has two P\'s? A, P, P, L, E -> but E excluded and duplicate P? Also, we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But in feedback, we haven\'t seen duplicates, so avoid for now.\n- If P in 3: A _ P _ _\n  - Words: ADAPT? But has D and T? T is excluded (from STAMP, T is x). So T is out.\n  - Avoid T? So not ADAPT.\n\nWe need to avoid S, T, M, etc.\n\nTry A in 1 and P in 4: A _ _ P _\n- Words: ALOUD? But no P. \n  - We need P in position 4: so A _ _ P _\n- Possible: ALPHA? But has H and L, but also A repeated? A, L, P, H, A -> duplicate A? We don\'t know if A is duplicated? But in the feedback, we only know one A is present. It could be more? But to be safe, avoid duplicates.\n\nAnother: AMPLY? But A in 1, M in 2? But M is excluded (from STAMP, M is x). So no.\n\nOption 2: A in position 4\n- Then P can be in 1,2,3.\n\nExample: P in 1 and A in 4: P _ _ A _\n- Words: POPPA? Duplicate P and A? Not good.\n  - Better: PULAS? Not a word.\n  - How about: PUDGY? But no A. We need A in position 4: so P _ _ A _\n  - Words: PIZZA? No A. \n  - Valid word: POKER? No A. \n  - We need a word with A in position 4: like OPERA? But O,P,E,R,A -> E and R are excluded. \n  - Avoid E and R.\n\nSo: P _ _ A _ and avoid C,R,N,E,S,T,M.\n\nPossible letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,O,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nTry: P _ _ A _\n- How about: PUDAL? Not a word.\n- Or: PAGOD? But A is in position 2? We need A in 4. PAGOD: P(1),A(2),G(3),O(4),D(5) -> A is in 2, but we need in 4.\n\nWe need A in 4: so the fourth letter is A.\n\nSo: P _ _ A _\n- Words: \n  - ""POLKA"" -> P(1), O(2), L(3), K(4), A(5) -> but A is in 5, not 4. We need A in 4? \n  - Actually, for A in position 4: the fourth letter is A, so the word pattern: ? ? ? A ?\n\nExample: ""DELTA"" but D,E,L,T,A -> E and T excluded.\n\nAnother: ""VODKA"" -> V,O,D,K,A -> A is in 5? Not 4.\n\nHard to find. Let\'s try A in 5.\n\nOption 3: A in position 5\n- Then P can be in 1,2,3,4.\n\nExample: P in 1 and A in 5: P _ _ _ A\n- Words: PIZZA? But no A in 5? P,I,Z,Z,A -> A in 5. But Z is not common. \n  - Better: PUPAL? Duplicate P? And A in 4? P,U,P,A,L -> A in 4, not 5.\n- Words ending with A: like OPERA? But E and R excluded.\n- Avoid excluded: so P _ _ _ A, with the middle three letters not C,R,N,E,S,T,M.\n\nPossible: ""PAGED""? But E excluded? P,A,G,E,D -> E is excluded.\n\n""PALED""? E excluded.\n\n""POLKA"" -> P,O,L,K,A -> A in 5. And letters: P,O,L,K,A. \n- O, L, K are new. \n- But we have A in 5 and P in 1.\n\nIs ""POLKA"" a word? Yes, it is.\n\nBut note: in POLKA, A is in 5 and P in 1. Also, we are testing O, L, K.\n\nBut we also have to consider that A cannot be in position 2 or 3, which is satisfied.\n\nAnother possibility: P in 2 and A in 5: _ P _ _ A\n- Words: SPRAY? But S excluded. \n  - Without S: UPPER? Duplicate P and E excluded? \n  - APPAL? Duplicate P and A? \n\nP in 3 and A in 5: _ _ P _ A\n- Words: ALPHA? A in 1? Not 5. \n  - HYPHA? Not common. \n  - TULPA? T excluded.\n\nP in 4 and A in 5: _ _ _ P A\n- Words: CAMPA? C excluded. \n  - GASPA? G,A,S,P,A -> duplicate A and S excluded? \n  - Better: ""GULPA""? Not a word. \n  - ""CARPA""? C excluded.\n\nSo ""POLKA"" seems a good candidate: P in 1, O in 2, L in 3, K in 4, A in 5.\n\nBut note: we are testing A in position 5 and P in position 1.\n\nWe also test O, L, K.\n\nBut we have to avoid the excluded letters: which we are (O, L, K not excluded yet).\n\nAnother word: ""PLACK""? But P in 1, L in 2, A in 3? But A cannot be in position 3 (from STAMP feedback, A in position 3 was wrong). So we cannot put A in 3.\n\nIn POLKA, A is in 5, which is allowed.\n\nAnother word: ""PODIA""? P in 1, O in 2, D in 3, I in 4, A in 5. Also good.\n\nBut ""PODIA"" is a word (plural of podium).\n\nSimilarly, ""POLKA"" and ""PODIA"" are both options.\n\nBut ""POLKA"" has K, which is less common? But it\'s valid.\n\nAlternatively, ""PADDY""? But A in 2? We cannot put A in 2. PADDY: P,A,D,D,Y -> A in 2, which is forbidden (we know A is not in 2). So invalid.\n\nSo between ""POLKA"" and ""PODIA"", both are acceptable.\n\nBut we also have to consider that P is in the word and we are putting it in position 1. If P is actually in position 1, we get a \'correct\' mark, which would be great. Similarly, if A is in 5, we get a correct mark.\n\nBut we don\'t know, so we are testing.\n\nAnother word: ""PULKA""? Not common.\n\nI think ""PODIA"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover more common letters.\n\nWe haven\'t used L, I, O, D, etc.\n\nIn ""PODIA"": P, O, D, I, A -> all distinct, avoids excluded letters.\n\nIn ""POLKA"": P, O, L, K, A.\n\nBoth are fine.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven\'t encountered any, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nI\'ll go with ""PODIA"" because it uses I and D, which are common.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: we know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3, so in PODIA, A is in 5, which is a candidate.\n\nP is in 1, which is a candidate position.\n\nSo, third guess: PODIA\n\nBut wait, we must ensure that we are not using any excluded letters. Excluded: C,R,N,E,S,T,M. PODIA: P,O,D,I,A — none of these are excluded.\n\nSo it\'s valid.\n\nAnother option: ""DAISY"" — but D,A,I,S,Y -> S is excluded? S is in the excluded list (from STAMP, S is x). So no.\n\nSo PODIA is good.\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that can test more positions.\n\nWe know A can be in 1,4,5. In PODIA, we are testing A in 5.\n\nWe know P can be in 1,2,3,4. In PODIA, we are testing P in 1.\n\nWe are also testing O in 2, D in 3, I in 4.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAlternatively, we could put A in position 1 and P in position 4, for example.\n\nWord: A _ _ P _\n\nWith A in 1 and P in 4: A _ _ P _\n\nAvoid excluded letters.\n\nPossible: ""ADOPT"" -> A,D,O,P,T -> but T is excluded? From STAMP, T is x. So no.\n\n""ALPHA"" -> A,L,P,H,A -> duplicate A? And A in 1 and 5? But we are putting A in 1 and then again in 5? The word has two A\'s? But we don\'t know. Also, in ALPHA, P is in 3? We are putting P in 3? But we want P in 4? ALPHA: A(1), L(2), P(3), H(4), A(5) -> so P is in 3, not 4.\n\nWe want P in 4: so A _ _ P _\n\nLike: A D U P T? Not a word.\n\nA G A P E? E excluded and duplicate A.\n\nHard to find.\n\nAnother: A W A P ? Duplicate A.\n\nSo perhaps PODIA is a reasonable choice.\n\nI think we should go with ""PODIA"".\n\nBut let me check: is ""PODIA"" accepted in Wordle? It should be, as it\'s a valid English word (plural of podium).\n\nSo, third guess: PODIA\n\nNow, in the response format.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: \n     - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → A is in the word but not in position 2.

S, T, M are absent.\n   - **Summary**:\n     - **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, S, T, M (cannot be used).\n     - **Present Letters**: A and P are confirmed in the word.\n     - **Position Constraints for A**: Cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE) or 3 (from STAMP), so must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n     - **Position Constraints for P**: Cannot be in position 5 (from STAMP), so must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n2. **Strategy for Next Guess**:\n   - Must include both A and P to test their positions, as they are confirmed present.\n   - Avoid all absent letters (C, R, N, E, S, T, M).\n   - Use new common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., D, I, O, L, K, etc.).\n   - Prefer distinct letters to cover more ground (no duplicates).\n   - Test feasible positions for A and P:\n     - A in 1, 4, or 5; P in 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n     - Avoid conflicting positions (e.g., if A is in 1, P cannot be in 1 unless duplicated, but duplicates are avoided for now).\n\n3. **Word Selection**:\n   - Considered options like ""POLKA"" (P in 1, A in 5) and ""PODIA"" (P in 1, A in 5). Both fit constraints and use new letters.\n   - ""PODIA"" (valid English word, plural of ""podium"") is chosen because:\n     - P is tested in position 1.\n     - A is tested in position 5 (a valid candidate position).\n     - Uses new common letters: O (position 2), D (position 3), I (position 4).\n     - Avoids all excluded letters and has no duplicates.\n     - Provides good coverage of untested letters (D, I, O) and helps narrow down positions for A and P.\n\n4. **Expected Outcomes**:\n   - If P is in position 1, it will show as correct (✓).\n   - If A is in position 5, it will show as correct (✓).\n   - Feedback on O, D, I will reveal if they are present and in the right positions, further reducing possibilities.\n\n<guess>podia</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stamp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) M(x) P(-)\nGuess 3: podia -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) D(x) I(x) A(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the third guess: PODIA -> P(✓) O(✓) D(x) I(x) A(✓)

Interpretation:
- P is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- O is correct and in the right position (position 2).
- D is not in the word (x).
- I is not in the word (x).
- A is correct and in the right position (position 5).

So, we now know:
- The secret word starts with ""P"", second letter is ""O"", and ends with ""A"". So the pattern is: P O _ _ A
- D and I are not in the word.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we know:
- A is not in position 2 or 3 (from earlier feedback), but now we know it is in position 5 (correct).
- P is in position 1 (correct).
- O is in position 2 (correct).

Also, the absent letters are: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, D, I.

We need to find a word that fits: P O _ _ A

The two middle letters (positions 3 and 4) are missing. We know they cannot be any of the absent letters.

Available letters (not tried or not absent): We have used: C,R,N,E,S,T,M,P,O,D,I,A. So absent: C,R,N,E,S,T,M,D,I.

Therefore, available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are the common ones).

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with two letters from the available set, forming a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- P O _ _ A

Common words that fit:
- POLKA: P,O,L,K,A -> but L and K are available? L and K not in absent list. However, we have to check if they are valid. But note: in POLKA, position 3 is L and position 4 is K. But we have feedback that D and I are absent, but L and K are new.

But wait, we already have a lot of information. The word must be P O ? ? A.

Let's list possible words:
- POLKA: P,O,L,K,A
- POKER: but E and R are absent? R is absent (from first guess) and E is absent, so no.
- POPPA: duplicate P? and A? but we have P in 1 and 5? But the word has P at 1, O at 2, P at 3, P at 4? That doesn't fit. POPPA is P,O,P,P,A -> but we have two P's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but in this case, we have P at position 1 and 4? But our pattern is P O _ _ A, so if we put P in position 3 or 4, that would be duplicate P? But we haven't had any duplicate feedback so far, so it's possible? However, we should avoid if possible.

But note: in the feedback, we have P as correct in position 1, so if there is another P, it might be marked as present or absent? But we don't know. However, to be safe, we can consider.

But let's avoid duplicates for now.

Other words:
- PONGA? But N is absent? N is in absent list (from first guess).
- POSHA? S is absent.
- POTSA? T and S absent.
- POUKA? U and K, but is it a word? Not common.
- POUCH? C and H, but C is absent? C is absent.

Better to think of common words.

Another: POLAR? But L and R? R is absent? R is absent (from first guess).

POXIA? X and I? I is absent? I is absent (from third guess).

So, let's list all possible words that fit P O _ _ A and use only available letters.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible combinations for positions 3 and 4:

- Position 3: any available letter
- Position 4: any available letter

Words:
- POLKA: P,O,L,K,A -> L in 3, K in 4. Valid word? Yes.
- POKA? Not 5 letters.
- POH A? Not a word.
- POGA? Not common.
- POCHA? But 5 letters? P,O,C,H,A -> C absent? C is absent, so no.
- POGYA? Not a word.
- POKRA? Not a word.
- POLAR? R absent.
- POPPY? Duplicate P and Y? But P is already at 1, so if we put P at 3 and 4? Then P,O,P,P,A -> but that's POPPA? Which is a word? But duplicate P. And we don't know if duplicates exist. But we can avoid.

Another: POUCH? C absent.

POUFF? Not ending with A.

POUKS? Not ending with A.

POUTS? T and S absent.

POWAN? W and A? But A is at 5, and N absent? N is absent.

POWND? D is absent? D is absent (from third guess).

POLLY? L and L? Duplicate L? And Y? But pattern P O L L A? That's POLLA? Not a word. POLLY ends with Y, not A.

POLYP? Ends with P, not A.

So, the only common word I can think of is POLKA.

But let me confirm: POLKA is a valid English word (a dance or music).

Also, we have not tried L or K, so they are available.

Another possibility: POKER? But E and R absent.

Or POKEY? But E and Y? E absent, and ends with Y.

What about ""VOLAR""? But V,O,L,A,R -> but O is at position 2? Our word must start with P, so no.

We are fixed: P O _ _ A.

Another word: ""YOGAS""? But not starting with P.

So, POLKA seems the most plausible.

But is there ""POTSA""? No, T and S absent.

""POMBA""? M absent? M is absent (from second guess).

""PONGA""? N absent.

""JOKER""? Not starting with P.

So, I think POLKA is a good guess.

But note: we have to make sure that L and K are not in the absent list. They are not, because we haven't tried them and they are not in the feedback as absent? We have tried: C,R,N,E,S,T,M,P,O,D,I,A. So L and K are new.

Therefore, we can guess POLKA.

But let me see if there are other options.

Another word: ""KOALA""? But starts with K, not P.

""POLAR"" is out.

""PULKA""? P,U,L,K,A -> but position 2 is U, not O? We need O in position 2.

So, no.

""PODIA"" we already tried, but that had D and I which are absent.

So, POLKA is the word.

Therefore, fourth guess: POLKA

But note: in POLKA, we are testing L in position 3 and K in position 4.

If the word is POLKA, we get all correct.

If not, we get feedback on L and K.

But we have only 6 tries, so we can do this.

Alternatively, we might think of other words, but I can't find any.

Another word: ""BOLAS""? But B,O,L,A,S -> S absent, and not starting with P? We have P fixed.

No.

""GOLDA""? G,O,L,D,A -> D absent, and not starting with P.

So, POLKA is the best bet.

Thus, we output POLKA.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - A is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - C, R, N, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: STAMP** → Feedback: S(x), T(x), A(-), M(x), P(-)  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - P is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - S, T, M are absent.  

- **Guess 3: PODIA** → Feedback: P(✓), O(✓), D(x), I(x), A(✓)  
  - P is correct and in position 1.  
  - O is correct and in position 2.  
  - A is correct and in position 5.  
  - D and I are absent.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **P**, has **O** in position 2, and ends with **A** (pattern: **P O _ _ A**).  
- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, D, I (cannot be used).  
- **Available letters to try**: B, F, G, H, K, L, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since these haven't been tested or ruled out).  
- The missing letters (positions 3 and 4) must be filled from the available letters to form a valid English word.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Focus on finding valid words matching the pattern **P O _ _ A** using available letters.  
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., L, K, H, G) to maximize information gain.  
- Avoid duplicate letters (since no duplicates have appeared in feedback so far).  
- The only common English word fitting the pattern and constraints is **POLKA** (P, O, L, K, A):  
  - Tests L in position 3 and K in position 4.  
  - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If not, feedback on L and K will reveal their status (e.g., absent or misplaced), narrowing possibilities for the next guess.
