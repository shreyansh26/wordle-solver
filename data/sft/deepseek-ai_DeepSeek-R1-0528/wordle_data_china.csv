We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(✓), R(x), A(-), N(✓), E(x)

Breaking this down:
- C is correct and in the right position (position 1). So the secret word starts with C.
- R is not in the word at all (x). So R is not present anywhere in the secret word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So A is present, but not in position 2.
- N is correct and in the right position (position 4). So the secret word has N as the fourth letter.
- E is not in the word (x). So E is absent.

So we know:
- Position 1: C
- Position 4: N
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 3 or 5, since position 1 is C and position 4 is N).
- The word does not contain R or E.

Recall the word length is 5, so positions: 1: C, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?

We have these constraints:
- Letter A must be in the word, but not at position 2 -> so either position 3 or 5.
- We cannot use R or E.

We need to make a guess that respects the known facts and helps us narrow down possibilities.

Let me think of words that start with C, end with N? Not necessarily, because A could be in position 3 or 5.

Actually, the fourth letter is N, so the word is _ _ _ N _? Wait, positions: 1=C, 2=?, 3=?, 4=N, 5=?

And A must be in either position 3 or 5.

Since A cannot be in position 2, and position 1 is taken by C, position 4 by N, so indeed 3 or 5.

Also, we can't use R or E.

Possible words: let's try to think of words starting with C and having N in the fourth position.

Common words: 
- C_ _ N _ 

We need A in either position 3 or 5.

Examples:
- If A is in position 3: C _ A N _ 
- If A is in position 5: C _ _ N A

Now, we must avoid R and E.

Let's consider candidates.

First, if A is in position 3: then the word is C _ A N _. 
We need a letter for position 2 and position 5. The known missing letter constraints: no R, no E.

Possible words: 
- CLAWN? But that doesn't seem right (not a word).
- CHAIN: but H and I are possibilities? Let me check: positions: C at 1, H at 2, A at 3, I at 4? But our feedback says N is at position 4, not I. So CHAIN has N? No, CHAIN is C-H-A-I-N, so position 4 is I, but we need position 4 to be N. So no.

Wait, we know position 4 is N. So CHAIN doesn't fit because the fourth letter is I, not N.

We need words with pattern C ? ? N ? and containing A in position 3 or 5.

More words:
- C ? ? N ? 
With A in position 3: then pattern is C ? A N ? 
What words? 
- CHANT: C-H-A-N-T -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T? That fits the pattern? But in CHANT, position 4 is N? Yes, because C-H-A-N-T: 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T.

We don't have any constraints against H or T. Also, from feedback, E and R are out, so H and T are okay.

But we have feedback that A is not in position 2, but in CHANT, A is in position 3 so that's fine. Also, we know A must be present and it is.

But does this word use any forbidden letters? No R and no E, so CHANT: H, A, N, T. None are R or E. So CHANT is a candidate.

Now, what about with A in position 5? Pattern: C ? ? N A
What words? 
- CORNA? Not a word.
- CUMNA? Not a word.
- DOGNA? No.
Actually, common words: 
- CA?NA: but we can't use R (so CARNA is out, also CARNA is not a word anyway).
- CYAN? But CYAN is 4 letters? We need 5 letters: C ? ? N A -> the only common one I can think of is ""china"", but CHINA: C-H-I-N-A -> position 4 is N, and position 5 is A. That fits: C-H-I-N-A.

But we have an I, which is allowed? We don't have any restrictions against I.

But let me check: secret word is 5 letters, CHINA: 
Position 1: C, 2: H, 3: I, 4: N, 5: A

Now, from feedback: we have A in the word but not at position 2? In CHINA, A is at position 5, so that matches.

But the feedback said A is marked as (-) meaning present but not position 2? Which is fine because in CHINA it is at position 5.

We also know N is at position 4 (correct).

And forbidden letters: R and E are out. CHINA has no R or E.

So CHINA and CHANT are both candidates.

But we have two possibilities? Maybe more.

Other words with pattern C ? A N ? : 
- CLANK: C-L-A-N-K. But K is not forbidden? But we don't know about L and K. However, in our first guess CRANE, we had N at the end? But CLANK is a word.

Pattern for CHANT: C-H-A-N-T
Pattern for CHINA: C-H-I-N-A
Pattern for CLANK: C-L-A-N-K

But CHANT and CHINA both have H? Not necessarily, but they do.

But we also have words ending with NA? Like C? ?NA: but position 4 must be N, so the fifth letter is free? Wait, pattern: position 4 is N, so the fifth can be any letter.

We have A must be in the word: either at position 3 or 5.

So other words: 
- If at position 5: words ending with NA? Like PENNA? But that doesn't start with C.
Starting with C: 
- CANT: only 4 letters? No, 5 letters: so must be C ? ? N A

Examples: CHINA (which we have), CZANA? Not a word. So CHINA is one.

- Without H? C as first and N fourth: 
  - C? ? N A: could be something like ""COSNA""? Not a word. 
  - ""CAVNA""? No.

Perhaps ""canna"" (a plant)? CANNA: but positions: C-A-N-N-A -> that has two N's? 
First: C, second: A, third: N, fourth: N? But our feedback says position 4 is N? Yes, but in CANNA, position 4 is the second N? So: 
C(1), A(2), N(3), N(4), A(5)

But we have an issue: the feedback from first guess: 
We guessed CRANE: which had A at position 3? Wait no: CRANE: C at1, R at2, A at3, N at4, E at5.

But the secret word: according to feedback, position 4 is N (correct), which matches CANNA? Position 4 is N? For CANNA: position 4 is N (since N is at 3 and 4? Positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:N, 4:N? Then the fourth letter is N? So yes.

But now feedback: we have a conflict because the secret word has A? We know A must be present? And in CANNA, there is A at position 2 and 5.

But our feedback: for the letter A in the first guess? We had A in position 3? The feedback said A is in the word but wrong position? Meaning the secret word doesn't have A at position 3? So if CANNA were the secret, then: 
- Guess: CRANE: at position 3 is A -> but secret has N at position 3? So A is not at position 3? But the secret word has A at position 2 and 5? Then the feedback for A (which was guessed in position 3) should be (-) meaning present but not at 3? That's consistent because A is present elsewhere. Also, the secret has A, so the feedback (-) for A is correct.

But more: the feedback also said about R: R is not present? In CANNA, there is no R? So that's fine. And E not present? Same.

So CANNA? But wait, CANNA has two N's? And our first guess CRANE had N? The feedback for N: we guessed N at position 4 and it was correct? So for CANNA, position 4 is N? So yes? But the secret word has two N's: one at position 3 and one at position 4? Our first guess CRANE had only one N? So the feedback for N: we got ✓ for position 4? That means position 4 has N? But in the secret word CANNA, position 4 is indeed N? So that's fine? And the secret has another N at position 3? That wasn't in our guess? So no conflict.

But we don't know that there are two N's? Yet? Because the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed? And since we only guessed one N? The feedback said that one N was correct? So if the secret has two N's, that's okay? We just don't know it yet? So CANNA is a possibility? But CANNA is a word? Yes.

Now, let me summarize what we know:
- The word starts with C and has N as the fourth letter.
- It contains A but not at position 3? From the first guess: we guessed A at position 3? The feedback says A is not at position 3? So the secret word does not have A at position 3? So if CANNA were the secret, then A should not be at position 3? But in CANNA, position 3 is N? Not A? And the secret has A at positions 2 and 5? So the feedback would be: A is present in the word but not at position 3? So (-) ? That's consistent.

But we have a constraint: from the first guess feedback, we know A is not at position 3? So in our candidate words, position 3 cannot be A? Wait: no, we guessed A at position 3? The feedback says it exists but not at that position? Meaning the actual word does not have A at position 3? So any candidate word must not have A at position 3.

Therefore:
- For CHANT: position 3 is A? So that must be wrong? Because if the secret word had A at position 3? Then when we guessed A at position 3, the feedback should have been ✓? But it was (-), meaning not position 3? So the secret cannot have A at position 3? Thus CHANT is invalid? Because CHANT has A at position 3? Therefore CANNA also has position 3 as N? So not A? Good.

Similarly, CHINA has position 3 as I? Not A? So both CHINA and CANNA have no A at position 3? CHANT has A at position 3? So CHANT is ruled out.

Clarify:

First guess: CRANE -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E? And feedback: C✓, R x, A -, N ✓, E x

This tells:
- A is in the word? But not at position 3? Because we guessed A at position 3 and got ""-"", which means the letter A is present but not in position 3? So the secret word contains A? And A is located somewhere else? So the secret word cannot have A at position 3? Any candidate word must have A? And A must not be in position 3.

Therefore:
- CHANT has A at position 3? Not allowed? So CHANT is impossible.
- CHINA has A at position 5? And position 3 is I? So no A at position 3? So okay.
- CANNA has A at position 2 and 5? Position 3 is N? So not A? So okay.

Therefore CHANT is eliminated.

Now CLANK: C-L-A-N-K? Position 3 is A? So ruled out? Because cannot have A at position 3.

Other word with C ? ? N ? with A not at position 3? And containing A? Let's list possible words:
Pattern: C [some letter] [some letter] N [some letter] 
But containing A? And A cannot be at position 3? So A must be at position 2 or 5? Because position 1 is C? Position 4 is N? So positions: 1=C, 2=?, 3=?, 4=N, 5=?
A must be at position 2 or 5? (since not 3)

Also, we know from feedback: R and E cannot be used.

So for position 2: can be A? Or other letters? But if it is A? Then the word is C A ? N ? 
And if position 5 is A? Then C ? ? N A

Candidates:
- Type 1: C A ? N ? 
Must contain A? Position 2 is A? So A is there? Also, can't have R,E.
Examples: 
  - CAB N ? : CABIN? Wait, but CABIN: C-A-B-I-N? Position: 1=C,2=A,3=B,4=I? But position 4 must be N? Not I? So not CABIN?
  - CANON? C-A-N-O-N? But position 4 we need N? In CANON: positions: 1:C,2:A,3:N? Then position 4=O, position5=N? But pattern: position4 must be N? So not? Unless it's C A ? N and then? So CANON doesn't fit because position4 is O? So we need pattern C A [letter] N [letter]? 
  - CAMAN? Not a word?
  - CAPAN? Not common? CAP'N? Not 5 letters?
  - CAVIN? Not a common word? So maybe not.

Common words: 
- CA?N? Perhaps CANAL? CANAL: C-A-N-A-L? Positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:N? Position 4 = A? But we need position 4 to be N? And here position 3 is N? Position 4 is A? Not what we want? We need position 4 to be N? So CANAL: position 4 is A? Not N.
- CANDY? C-A-N-D-Y? Positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D? Position 4=D? Not N? So no.

Hard? Let's go to type: C ? ? N A: words ending with NA? Like:
- C? ? N A: common: 
  - CHINA: C-H-I-N-A -> 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A? This fits: position1=C, position4=N, and A at position5? Not position3? Good.
  - CANNA: C-A-N-N-A? But wait, positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A? Position4=N? Yes? And A at position2 and5? Not position3? So we found two? CANNA and CHINA.

But CANNA has two N's and two A's? That's fine.

Another possibility: CZENA? Not a word? COINS? No? CONNA? Not? So CHINA and CANNA seem prominent.

Also, CLINA? Not? Or CRINA? But CR has R? Forbidden? So CRINA is out.

Also, CINCH? No? CINCH is C-I-N-C-H? Positions:1:C,2:I,3:N,4:C,5:H? Position4 is C? Not N.

Another: WOMAN? Not starting with C? 

So candidates: CHINA and CANNA.

How about CHINA: we need to avoid E and R? Yes? H,I,N,A: none are E or R? CANNA: C,A,N,N,A: no E or R.

But we don't know about other letters? Also, our first guess didn't have H or I? We haven't tested those.

We need to make a guess that can discriminate between CHINA and CANNA? Or other possibilities? Are there more?

What about words that don't end with A? Because A could be only at position 2? For example, C A ? N ? ? 
We couldn't find many? Except impossible? So perhaps CHINA and CANNA are main?

But CANNA is a botanical term? Maybe it's not in the word list? Let's assume it is? 

We can think of other words? For example, CHINA with different middle? Or maybe ""china"" is common.

Also, ""corna"" is not a word? 

Another: ""canna"" or ""china""? 

But we should consider: the first guess had letters C,R,A,N,E? So we know about these? And we excluded R and E? But what about other letters? We don't know? 

Our second guess should aim to test the possibilities? For example, test if there is a double N? Or test the letters H and I? Or the position of A?

Ideal guess: we need a word that fits the constraints and helps us find the secret.

But wait, CHINA: C?H?I?N?A?

Constraints:
- Position 1: C
- Position 4: N
- A must be present: either at position 2 or 5? In CANNA at position 2 and5? In CHINA at position5? So in both, position5? Not? Only position5? In CHINA? Position5=A? In CANNA? Position5=A? Also position2=A? So both have A at position5? In fact, both end with A? Because position5=A? Wait: in CHINA? C,H,I,N,A? So ends with A? In CANNA? Also ends with A? Position5=A? So actually, both have position5=A? Then: from feedback? We first guessed CRANE? Position5 was E? And E is not in the word? So indeed, position5? But now we know position5 is A? Because both candidates end with A? Not necessarily? Only for these two? But actually, from the constraints: A must be at position2 or position5? But if we guess a word with position5 not A? We don't know? 

Wait, we don't know if A is at position2 or position5? But in our candidates? Also, we have only two? But let me think: position5 could be other letters? But with the constraint that A must be at position2 or5? So for example, we can have a word like? C S ? N A? But if position5 is A? Then it ends with A? Or if position2 is A? Then second letter A.

But we haven't proved position5 is A? Only that if A is not at position2? Then it's at position5? But we don't know? 

In CHINA, position2 is H? Not A? Position5 is A? In CANNA, position2 is A? Position5 is A? So CANNA has two A's? 

But we don't know position5 is A? We know it can be A? 

Let me solve part: we can guess a word that includes position2? For example, test with position2 as a vowel or something? 

Alternatively? Since we need to confirm, I can guess CHINA or CANNA directly? But I have 6 guesses? And I am at guess 2? Maybe not? 

Or make a guess that has H? And I? Because for CHINA, if I guess CHINA, then if it's correct? I win? But if it's not? Then it might be CANNA? So it helps? Also, if I guess CHINA, the feedback will tell?

But to save guesses? I can guess a word that tests multiple possibilities.

Given positions:
1 = C (fixed)
2 = ?
3 = ? (cannot be A, because we know A not at position3 from feedback)
4 = N (fixed)
5 = ?

A must be in the word, at position2 or position5? 

We can also think: our guess should include letters that are common? To test? 

Idea: since we need to find out what is at position2 and3? And we know position1=C, position4=N, position5=? And A is either at2 or5? 

If we guess a word with C at1, N at4? And with A at position2? Or position5? To see? 

For example, let's guess ""CANAL""? But ""CANAL"" has position3=N? Then position4=A? But our secret has position4=N? So that doesn't fit? Because we must keep position1=C and position4=N? So our second guess must also start with C and have fourth letter N? Essentially, we are trying to guess the word? 

Yes? But also, we can guess any 5-letters? Not necessarily with C at1 and N at4? But the feedback will come? And it might help?

Option: 
- Guess with C at1 and N at4? Because we know them? So our guess can have C at1 and N at4? Then the feedback will tell about the other positions? That might be efficient? Because we are testing position2,3,5? 

But we also have the A? We know A is present? So if we guess a word with A at position2? Then if the secret has A at position2? We get ✓ for A? Otherwise, if it's CANNA? We have A at position2? But for CHINA? Position2 is not A? So it depends.

Let's design a new guess that keeps C and N at positions 1 and 4? And uses new letters to cover possibilities.

Set pattern: C ? ? N ?

Guess:
- We need to test position2: is it A? Or something else? 
- We need to test what letter is at position3? Cannot be A? So vowels or consonants? 
- Also, we know A must be present? So if position2 and5? If we don't put A in position2? Then the feedback will tell if A is present? But we already know A is present? So we don't need to test? We can omit A? To see if it appears? But we know it is there? So we can use A in our guess? Or not?

But if we guess without A? Then if the secret has A? The feedback will show A in the word? But we already know? So we can save a letter?

Perhaps include letters that are common? Like vowels? 

But let me form a guess: 
Pattern: C ? ? N ?

But we cannot use R or E? And avoid letters in the first guess? But we have A we know is in? So we can use A.

Candidates: 
- CHINA: C-H-I-N-A? But if I guess CHINA, then:
    If correct: I win.
    If not? Then? For example, if secret is CANNA? Then feedback:
        C:✓ position1
        H: x? Because CANNA has no H? 
        I: x? No I? 
        N:✓ at position4? But since CANNA has two N's? And we guessed only one N? How feedback? 
        For N: we have a N at position4? And secret also has N at position3? But we didn't guess position3? So feedback for N: if the secret has multiple N? And we guess N at a correct position? We get ✓? Otherwise, if we guessed at wrong position? We get -? But here: we guess N at position4? Secret has N at position4? So ✓? Also, secret has another N at position3? But since we didn't guess a N at position3? So it doesn't affect? 
        Then A: at position5? Secret has A at position5? So ✓? 
        But H and I: absent? So: feedback: H(x), I(x)? So for our guess CHINA: position1: C✓, H?x, I?x, N✓, A✓? 
        Only C, N, A correct? Position2 and3 unknown? 

Then we know the secret has C and N? But didn't get new constraints? Except that H and I are not present? 

Then the secret word must be? Without H or I? And position1=C, position4=N? Position5=A? Because we got A✓? So now we know position5=A? 

Then pattern: C ? ? N A

And from feedback: H and I are absent? 

Then candidate: CANNA? Now we guess CANNA? But CANNA has C,A,N,N,A? Positions:1:C,2:A,3:N,4:N,5:A? 

But when we guess CANNA? Then we can see: 
C:✓, A? At position2? But secret also has A at position2? So if secret is CANNA? Then ✓ for A at position2? Then we get all ✓? 

Meanwhile, for position3? We guessed I? But it's N? So in feedback?

Actually? After guessing CHINA and getting feedback: for CHINA guess against CANNA secret: 
- C: found at position1? ✓
- H: not at position2? And not in word? x
- I: not at position3? And not in word? x
- N: found at position4? ✓
- A: found at position5? ✓

So positions 1,4,5 correct? Positions 2 and3 incorrect? And H and I absent? 

Then we know the secret pattern: C [not H, not I] [not H, not I] N A? And it contains A? Which is already at position5? And we know A is also at position2? From CANNA? But wait? This feedback doesn't tell us about the A at position2? Because we didn't guess at position2? 

Also, we get no information about the letter at position2? Because our guess at position2 was H? Which is not present? And similarly position3? 

Then we can try CANNA? Because it's a candidate? 

But we might have other words? Ending with NA? And starting with C? Like ""china"" is one? But with feedback from CHINA? We ruled out H and I? Then what? 

Without H and I? Words like? C ? ? N A? ? ? 

Letters: can be from A-Z? Excluding E,R? And now H,I? So excluding H and I? 

Possible words:
- CANNA: C-A-N-N-A? Positions:1:C,2:A,3:N,4:N,5:A? But A appears twice? 
- Other? C L N A? C? ? N A? Like CLENA? Not? COUNA? Not? CU?NA? CUMNA? No? 
- C ? N N A? Positions:1:C,2:?,3:N,4:N? But that’s? Wait, no: pattern C ? ? N A? With letters 2? and3? 

For example: CAMAN? Not? CA MAN? 
CABANA? But 6 letters? No? 
CANAS? But not common? 
Actually? The word ""canal"" is 5 letters? But position4 must be N? CANAL has position4=A? Not N? So not? 
""CONGA""? C-O-N-G-A? Position3=N? Position4=G? Not N? 
""CANDY"" position4=D? Not N? 

So the only candidate I can think of is CANNA? 

Therefore? To save time? Let me guess CHINA? Because we have C,H,I,N,A? And if correct? Good? If not? Then we know it must be CANNA? And we can guess CAN? 

But CHINA vs CANNA: different? 

But also? What about ""corna""? Not a word? 

Or ""china"" is a word? CANNA is also? 

Perhaps make a different guess? That doesn't include H and I? So we avoid the problem? 

For example? Let me guess a word that starts with C and has N at position4? And includes A at position2? To test if position2 is A? 

Guess? For example, ""CANNA"" directly? But CANNA? But we haven't tested? 

Since we have to guess? Let me design a guess?

Pattern: C ? ? N ? ? 

We know no E? No R? 

Put A? 

But position3 cannot be A? So if we put A? Only at position2 or position5? 

Put at position2: then guess C A ? N ? 

Then? What letters? We need to choose? 

For position3: candidates? Not A? So what? Common letters? Not R? Not E? 

Also, for position5:? 

Example: CAYAN? Not? CANDN? Illegal? 

Only ""CANNA""? But it has double N? 

Or CABAN? Not a word? 

""CABIN"" doesn't work? ""Cabin"" has position4=I? 

Difficult? 

Perhaps put A at position5? Guess C ? ? N A? 

Then? Position2 and3:? Must not be? 

Example: CHINA with H and I? But we want to avoid? 

Without rare letters? 

CULNA? Not? 

CONCLUSION: We should guess one of CHINA or CANNA? 

I'll guess CHINA? Because it's more common? 

Therefore? My second guess: CHINA? 

If it's wrong? Then we might get feedback that helps? 

So.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- Position 1: C ✓ → The secret word starts with ""C"".
- Position 2: R x → ""R"" is not in the word.
- Position 3: A - → ""A"" is in the word but not at position 3.
- Position 4: N ✓ → The secret word has ""N"" at position 4.
- Position 5: E x → ""E"" is not in the word.

Constraints:
- The word must start with ""C"" and have ""N"" at position 4.
- ""A"" must be present, but not at position 3 → so it must be at position 2 or 5.
- ""R"" and ""E"" are absent.
- Position 3 cannot have ""A"" → possible letters are unknown.

Possible words:
- **CHINA**: C (1), H (2), I (3), N (4), A (5) → fits constraints (A at 5, not 4).
- **CANNA**: C (1), A (2), N (3), N (4), A (5) → fits constraints (A at 2 and 5, not 3).

Given that ""CHINA"" is a more common word, it is chosen as the second guess to test these possibilities:
- If correct, it wins.
- If incorrect, feedback on positions 2, 3, and 5 will help narrow it down (e.g., confirming ""CANNA"" or another word).

<guess>china</guess>",china,"We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(✓), R(x), A(-), N(✓), E(x)

Breaking this down:
- C is correct and in the right position (position 1). So the secret word starts with C.
- R is not in the word at all (x). So R is not present anywhere in the secret word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So A is present, but not in position 2.
- N is correct and in the right position (position 4). So the secret word has N as the fourth letter.
- E is not in the word (x). So E is absent.

So we know:
- Position 1: C
- Position 4: N
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 3 or 5, since position 1 is C and position 4 is N).
- The word does not contain R or E.

Recall the word length is 5, so positions: 1: C, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?

We have these constraints:
- Letter A must be in the word, but not at position 2 -> so either position 3 or 5.
- We cannot use R or E.

We need to make a guess that respects the known facts and helps us narrow down possibilities.

Let me think of words that start with C, end with N? Not necessarily, because A could be in position 3 or 5.

Actually, the fourth letter is N, so the word is _ _ _ N _? Wait, positions: 1=C, 2=?, 3=?, 4=N, 5=?

And A must be in either position 3 or 5.

Since A cannot be in position 2, and position 1 is taken by C, position 4 by N, so indeed 3 or 5.

Also, we can't use R or E.

Possible words: let's try to think of words starting with C and having N in the fourth position.

Common words: 
- C_ _ N _ 

We need A in either position 3 or 5.

Examples:
- If A is in position 3: C _ A N _ 
- If A is in position 5: C _ _ N A

Now, we must avoid R and E.

Let's consider candidates.

First, if A is in position 3: then the word is C _ A N _. 
We need a letter for position 2 and position 5. The known missing letter constraints: no R, no E.

Possible words: 
- CLAWN? But that doesn't seem right (not a word).
- CHAIN: but H and I are possibilities? Let me check: positions: C at 1, H at 2, A at 3, I at 4? But our feedback says N is at position 4, not I. So CHAIN has N? No, CHAIN is C-H-A-I-N, so position 4 is I, but we need position 4 to be N. So no.

Wait, we know position 4 is N. So CHAIN doesn't fit because the fourth letter is I, not N.

We need words with pattern C ? ? N ? and containing A in position 3 or 5.

More words:
- C ? ? N ? 
With A in position 3: then pattern is C ? A N ? 
What words? 
- CHANT: C-H-A-N-T -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T? That fits the pattern? But in CHANT, position 4 is N? Yes, because C-H-A-N-T: 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T.

We don't have any constraints against H or T. Also, from feedback, E and R are out, so H and T are okay.

But we have feedback that A is not in position 2, but in CHANT, A is in position 3 so that's fine. Also, we know A must be present and it is.

But does this word use any forbidden letters? No R and no E, so CHANT: H, A, N, T. None are R or E. So CHANT is a candidate.

Now, what about with A in position 5? Pattern: C ? ? N A
What words? 
- CORNA? Not a word.
- CUMNA? Not a word.
- DOGNA? No.
Actually, common words: 
- CA?NA: but we can't use R (so CARNA is out, also CARNA is not a word anyway).
- CYAN? But CYAN is 4 letters? We need 5 letters: C ? ? N A -> the only common one I can think of is ""china"", but CHINA: C-H-I-N-A -> position 4 is N, and position 5 is A. That fits: C-H-I-N-A.

But we have an I, which is allowed? We don't have any restrictions against I.

But let me check: secret word is 5 letters, CHINA: 
Position 1: C, 2: H, 3: I, 4: N, 5: A

Now, from feedback: we have A in the word but not at position 2? In CHINA, A is at position 5, so that matches.

But the feedback said A is marked as (-) meaning present but not position 2? Which is fine because in CHINA it is at position 5.

We also know N is at position 4 (correct).

And forbidden letters: R and E are out. CHINA has no R or E.

So CHINA and CHANT are both candidates.

But we have two possibilities? Maybe more.

Other words with pattern C ? A N ? : 
- CLANK: C-L-A-N-K. But K is not forbidden? But we don't know about L and K. However, in our first guess CRANE, we had N at the end? But CLANK is a word.

Pattern for CHANT: C-H-A-N-T
Pattern for CHINA: C-H-I-N-A
Pattern for CLANK: C-L-A-N-K

But CHANT and CHINA both have H? Not necessarily, but they do.

But we also have words ending with NA? Like C? ?NA: but position 4 must be N, so the fifth letter is free? Wait, pattern: position 4 is N, so the fifth can be any letter.

We have A must be in the word: either at position 3 or 5.

So other words: 
- If at position 5: words ending with NA? Like PENNA? But that doesn't start with C.
Starting with C: 
- CANT: only 4 letters? No, 5 letters: so must be C ? ? N A

Examples: CHINA (which we have), CZANA? Not a word. So CHINA is one.

- Without H? C as first and N fourth: 
  - C? ? N A: could be something like ""COSNA""? Not a word. 
  - ""CAVNA""? No.

Perhaps ""canna"" (a plant)? CANNA: but positions: C-A-N-N-A -> that has two N's? 
First: C, second: A, third: N, fourth: N? But our feedback says position 4 is N? Yes, but in CANNA, position 4 is the second N? So: 
C(1), A(2), N(3), N(4), A(5)

But we have an issue: the feedback from first guess: 
We guessed CRANE: which had A at position 3? Wait no: CRANE: C at1, R at2, A at3, N at4, E at5.

But the secret word: according to feedback, position 4 is N (correct), which matches CANNA? Position 4 is N? For CANNA: position 4 is N (since N is at 3 and 4? Positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:N, 4:N? Then the fourth letter is N? So yes.

But now feedback: we have a conflict because the secret word has A? We know A must be present? And in CANNA, there is A at position 2 and 5.

But our feedback: for the letter A in the first guess? We had A in position 3? The feedback said A is in the word but wrong position? Meaning the secret word doesn't have A at position 3? So if CANNA were the secret, then: 
- Guess: CRANE: at position 3 is A -> but secret has N at position 3? So A is not at position 3? But the secret word has A at position 2 and 5? Then the feedback for A (which was guessed in position 3) should be (-) meaning present but not at 3? That's consistent because A is present elsewhere. Also, the secret has A, so the feedback (-) for A is correct.

But more: the feedback also said about R: R is not present? In CANNA, there is no R? So that's fine. And E not present? Same.

So CANNA? But wait, CANNA has two N's? And our first guess CRANE had N? The feedback for N: we guessed N at position 4 and it was correct? So for CANNA, position 4 is N? So yes? But the secret word has two N's: one at position 3 and one at position 4? Our first guess CRANE had only one N? So the feedback for N: we got ✓ for position 4? That means position 4 has N? But in the secret word CANNA, position 4 is indeed N? So that's fine? And the secret has another N at position 3? That wasn't in our guess? So no conflict.

But we don't know that there are two N's? Yet? Because the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed? And since we only guessed one N? The feedback said that one N was correct? So if the secret has two N's, that's okay? We just don't know it yet? So CANNA is a possibility? But CANNA is a word? Yes.

Now, let me summarize what we know:
- The word starts with C and has N as the fourth letter.
- It contains A but not at position 3? From the first guess: we guessed A at position 3? The feedback says A is not at position 3? So the secret word does not have A at position 3? So if CANNA were the secret, then A should not be at position 3? But in CANNA, position 3 is N? Not A? And the secret has A at positions 2 and 5? So the feedback would be: A is present in the word but not at position 3? So (-) ? That's consistent.

But we have a constraint: from the first guess feedback, we know A is not at position 3? So in our candidate words, position 3 cannot be A? Wait: no, we guessed A at position 3? The feedback says it exists but not at that position? Meaning the actual word does not have A at position 3? So any candidate word must not have A at position 3.

Therefore:
- For CHANT: position 3 is A? So that must be wrong? Because if the secret word had A at position 3? Then when we guessed A at position 3, the feedback should have been ✓? But it was (-), meaning not position 3? So the secret cannot have A at position 3? Thus CHANT is invalid? Because CHANT has A at position 3? Therefore CANNA also has position 3 as N? So not A? Good.

Similarly, CHINA has position 3 as I? Not A? So both CHINA and CANNA have no A at position 3? CHANT has A at position 3? So CHANT is ruled out.

Clarify:

First guess: CRANE -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E? And feedback: C✓, R x, A -, N ✓, E x

This tells:
- A is in the word? But not at position 3? Because we guessed A at position 3 and got ""-"", which means the letter A is present but not in position 3? So the secret word contains A? And A is located somewhere else? So the secret word cannot have A at position 3? Any candidate word must have A? And A must not be in position 3.

Therefore:
- CHANT has A at position 3? Not allowed? So CHANT is impossible.
- CHINA has A at position 5? And position 3 is I? So no A at position 3? So okay.
- CANNA has A at position 2 and 5? Position 3 is N? So not A? So okay.

Therefore CHANT is eliminated.

Now CLANK: C-L-A-N-K? Position 3 is A? So ruled out? Because cannot have A at position 3.

Other word with C ? ? N ? with A not at position 3? And containing A? Let's list possible words:
Pattern: C [some letter] [some letter] N [some letter] 
But containing A? And A cannot be at position 3? So A must be at position 2 or 5? Because position 1 is C? Position 4 is N? So positions: 1=C, 2=?, 3=?, 4=N, 5=?
A must be at position 2 or 5? (since not 3)

Also, we know from feedback: R and E cannot be used.

So for position 2: can be A? Or other letters? But if it is A? Then the word is C A ? N ? 
And if position 5 is A? Then C ? ? N A

Candidates:
- Type 1: C A ? N ? 
Must contain A? Position 2 is A? So A is there? Also, can't have R,E.
Examples: 
  - CAB N ? : CABIN? Wait, but CABIN: C-A-B-I-N? Position: 1=C,2=A,3=B,4=I? But position 4 must be N? Not I? So not CABIN?
  - CANON? C-A-N-O-N? But position 4 we need N? In CANON: positions: 1:C,2:A,3:N? Then position 4=O, position5=N? But pattern: position4 must be N? So not? Unless it's C A ? N and then? So CANON doesn't fit because position4 is O? So we need pattern C A [letter] N [letter]? 
  - CAMAN? Not a word?
  - CAPAN? Not common? CAP'N? Not 5 letters?
  - CAVIN? Not a common word? So maybe not.

Common words: 
- CA?N? Perhaps CANAL? CANAL: C-A-N-A-L? Positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:N? Position 4 = A? But we need position 4 to be N? And here position 3 is N? Position 4 is A? Not what we want? We need position 4 to be N? So CANAL: position 4 is A? Not N.
- CANDY? C-A-N-D-Y? Positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D? Position 4=D? Not N? So no.

Hard? Let's go to type: C ? ? N A: words ending with NA? Like:
- C? ? N A: common: 
  - CHINA: C-H-I-N-A -> 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A? This fits: position1=C, position4=N, and A at position5? Not position3? Good.
  - CANNA: C-A-N-N-A? But wait, positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A? Position4=N? Yes? And A at position2 and5? Not position3? So we found two? CANNA and CHINA.

But CANNA has two N's and two A's? That's fine.

Another possibility: CZENA? Not a word? COINS? No? CONNA? Not? So CHINA and CANNA seem prominent.

Also, CLINA? Not? Or CRINA? But CR has R? Forbidden? So CRINA is out.

Also, CINCH? No? CINCH is C-I-N-C-H? Positions:1:C,2:I,3:N,4:C,5:H? Position4 is C? Not N.

Another: WOMAN? Not starting with C? 

So candidates: CHINA and CANNA.

How about CHINA: we need to avoid E and R? Yes? H,I,N,A: none are E or R? CANNA: C,A,N,N,A: no E or R.

But we don't know about other letters? Also, our first guess didn't have H or I? We haven't tested those.

We need to make a guess that can discriminate between CHINA and CANNA? Or other possibilities? Are there more?

What about words that don't end with A? Because A could be only at position 2? For example, C A ? N ? ? 
We couldn't find many? Except impossible? So perhaps CHINA and CANNA are main?

But CANNA is a botanical term? Maybe it's not in the word list? Let's assume it is? 

We can think of other words? For example, CHINA with different middle? Or maybe ""china"" is common.

Also, ""corna"" is not a word? 

Another: ""canna"" or ""china""? 

But we should consider: the first guess had letters C,R,A,N,E? So we know about these? And we excluded R and E? But what about other letters? We don't know? 

Our second guess should aim to test the possibilities? For example, test if there is a double N? Or test the letters H and I? Or the position of A?

Ideal guess: we need a word that fits the constraints and helps us find the secret.

But wait, CHINA: C?H?I?N?A?

Constraints:
- Position 1: C
- Position 4: N
- A must be present: either at position 2 or 5? In CANNA at position 2 and5? In CHINA at position5? So in both, position5? Not? Only position5? In CHINA? Position5=A? In CANNA? Position5=A? Also position2=A? So both have A at position5? In fact, both end with A? Because position5=A? Wait: in CHINA? C,H,I,N,A? So ends with A? In CANNA? Also ends with A? Position5=A? So actually, both have position5=A? Then: from feedback? We first guessed CRANE? Position5 was E? And E is not in the word? So indeed, position5? But now we know position5 is A? Because both candidates end with A? Not necessarily? Only for these two? But actually, from the constraints: A must be at position2 or position5? But if we guess a word with position5 not A? We don't know? 

Wait, we don't know if A is at position2 or position5? But in our candidates? Also, we have only two? But let me think: position5 could be other letters? But with the constraint that A must be at position2 or5? So for example, we can have a word like? C S ? N A? But if position5 is A? Then it ends with A? Or if position2 is A? Then second letter A.

But we haven't proved position5 is A? Only that if A is not at position2? Then it's at position5? But we don't know? 

In CHINA, position2 is H? Not A? Position5 is A? In CANNA, position2 is A? Position5 is A? So CANNA has two A's? 

But we don't know position5 is A? We know it can be A? 

Let me solve part: we can guess a word that includes position2? For example, test with position2 as a vowel or something? 

Alternatively? Since we need to confirm, I can guess CHINA or CANNA directly? But I have 6 guesses? And I am at guess 2? Maybe not? 

Or make a guess that has H? And I? Because for CHINA, if I guess CHINA, then if it's correct? I win? But if it's not? Then it might be CANNA? So it helps? Also, if I guess CHINA, the feedback will tell?

But to save guesses? I can guess a word that tests multiple possibilities.

Given positions:
1 = C (fixed)
2 = ?
3 = ? (cannot be A, because we know A not at position3 from feedback)
4 = N (fixed)
5 = ?

A must be in the word, at position2 or position5? 

We can also think: our guess should include letters that are common? To test? 

Idea: since we need to find out what is at position2 and3? And we know position1=C, position4=N, position5=? And A is either at2 or5? 

If we guess a word with C at1, N at4? And with A at position2? Or position5? To see? 

For example, let's guess ""CANAL""? But ""CANAL"" has position3=N? Then position4=A? But our secret has position4=N? So that doesn't fit? Because we must keep position1=C and position4=N? So our second guess must also start with C and have fourth letter N? Essentially, we are trying to guess the word? 

Yes? But also, we can guess any 5-letters? Not necessarily with C at1 and N at4? But the feedback will come? And it might help?

Option: 
- Guess with C at1 and N at4? Because we know them? So our guess can have C at1 and N at4? Then the feedback will tell about the other positions? That might be efficient? Because we are testing position2,3,5? 

But we also have the A? We know A is present? So if we guess a word with A at position2? Then if the secret has A at position2? We get ✓ for A? Otherwise, if it's CANNA? We have A at position2? But for CHINA? Position2 is not A? So it depends.

Let's design a new guess that keeps C and N at positions 1 and 4? And uses new letters to cover possibilities.

Set pattern: C ? ? N ?

Guess:
- We need to test position2: is it A? Or something else? 
- We need to test what letter is at position3? Cannot be A? So vowels or consonants? 
- Also, we know A must be present? So if position2 and5? If we don't put A in position2? Then the feedback will tell if A is present? But we already know A is present? So we don't need to test? We can omit A? To see if it appears? But we know it is there? So we can use A in our guess? Or not?

But if we guess without A? Then if the secret has A? The feedback will show A in the word? But we already know? So we can save a letter?

Perhaps include letters that are common? Like vowels? 

But let me form a guess: 
Pattern: C ? ? N ?

But we cannot use R or E? And avoid letters in the first guess? But we have A we know is in? So we can use A.

Candidates: 
- CHINA: C-H-I-N-A? But if I guess CHINA, then:
    If correct: I win.
    If not? Then? For example, if secret is CANNA? Then feedback:
        C:✓ position1
        H: x? Because CANNA has no H? 
        I: x? No I? 
        N:✓ at position4? But since CANNA has two N's? And we guessed only one N? How feedback? 
        For N: we have a N at position4? And secret also has N at position3? But we didn't guess position3? So feedback for N: if the secret has multiple N? And we guess N at a correct position? We get ✓? Otherwise, if we guessed at wrong position? We get -? But here: we guess N at position4? Secret has N at position4? So ✓? Also, secret has another N at position3? But since we didn't guess a N at position3? So it doesn't affect? 
        Then A: at position5? Secret has A at position5? So ✓? 
        But H and I: absent? So: feedback: H(x), I(x)? So for our guess CHINA: position1: C✓, H?x, I?x, N✓, A✓? 
        Only C, N, A correct? Position2 and3 unknown? 

Then we know the secret has C and N? But didn't get new constraints? Except that H and I are not present? 

Then the secret word must be? Without H or I? And position1=C, position4=N? Position5=A? Because we got A✓? So now we know position5=A? 

Then pattern: C ? ? N A

And from feedback: H and I are absent? 

Then candidate: CANNA? Now we guess CANNA? But CANNA has C,A,N,N,A? Positions:1:C,2:A,3:N,4:N,5:A? 

But when we guess CANNA? Then we can see: 
C:✓, A? At position2? But secret also has A at position2? So if secret is CANNA? Then ✓ for A at position2? Then we get all ✓? 

Meanwhile, for position3? We guessed I? But it's N? So in feedback?

Actually? After guessing CHINA and getting feedback: for CHINA guess against CANNA secret: 
- C: found at position1? ✓
- H: not at position2? And not in word? x
- I: not at position3? And not in word? x
- N: found at position4? ✓
- A: found at position5? ✓

So positions 1,4,5 correct? Positions 2 and3 incorrect? And H and I absent? 

Then we know the secret pattern: C [not H, not I] [not H, not I] N A? And it contains A? Which is already at position5? And we know A is also at position2? From CANNA? But wait? This feedback doesn't tell us about the A at position2? Because we didn't guess at position2? 

Also, we get no information about the letter at position2? Because our guess at position2 was H? Which is not present? And similarly position3? 

Then we can try CANNA? Because it's a candidate? 

But we might have other words? Ending with NA? And starting with C? Like ""china"" is one? But with feedback from CHINA? We ruled out H and I? Then what? 

Without H and I? Words like? C ? ? N A? ? ? 

Letters: can be from A-Z? Excluding E,R? And now H,I? So excluding H and I? 

Possible words:
- CANNA: C-A-N-N-A? Positions:1:C,2:A,3:N,4:N,5:A? But A appears twice? 
- Other? C L N A? C? ? N A? Like CLENA? Not? COUNA? Not? CU?NA? CUMNA? No? 
- C ? N N A? Positions:1:C,2:?,3:N,4:N? But that’s? Wait, no: pattern C ? ? N A? With letters 2? and3? 

For example: CAMAN? Not? CA MAN? 
CABANA? But 6 letters? No? 
CANAS? But not common? 
Actually? The word ""canal"" is 5 letters? But position4 must be N? CANAL has position4=A? Not N? So not? 
""CONGA""? C-O-N-G-A? Position3=N? Position4=G? Not N? 
""CANDY"" position4=D? Not N? 

So the only candidate I can think of is CANNA? 

Therefore? To save time? Let me guess CHINA? Because we have C,H,I,N,A? And if correct? Good? If not? Then we know it must be CANNA? And we can guess CAN? 

But CHINA vs CANNA: different? 

But also? What about ""corna""? Not a word? 

Or ""china"" is a word? CANNA is also? 

Perhaps make a different guess? That doesn't include H and I? So we avoid the problem? 

For example? Let me guess a word that starts with C and has N at position4? And includes A at position2? To test if position2 is A? 

Guess? For example, ""CANNA"" directly? But CANNA? But we haven't tested? 

Since we have to guess? Let me design a guess?

Pattern: C ? ? N ? ? 

We know no E? No R? 

Put A? 

But position3 cannot be A? So if we put A? Only at position2 or position5? 

Put at position2: then guess C A ? N ? 

Then? What letters? We need to choose? 

For position3: candidates? Not A? So what? Common letters? Not R? Not E? 

Also, for position5:? 

Example: CAYAN? Not? CANDN? Illegal? 

Only ""CANNA""? But it has double N? 

Or CABAN? Not a word? 

""CABIN"" doesn't work? ""Cabin"" has position4=I? 

Difficult? 

Perhaps put A at position5? Guess C ? ? N A? 

Then? Position2 and3:? Must not be? 

Example: CHINA with H and I? But we want to avoid? 

Without rare letters? 

CULNA? Not? 

CONCLUSION: We should guess one of CHINA or CANNA? 

I'll guess CHINA? Because it's more common? 

Therefore? My second guess: CHINA? 

If it's wrong? Then we might get feedback that helps? 

So.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- Position 1: C ✓ → The secret word starts with ""C"".
- Position 2: R x → ""R"" is not in the word.
- Position 3: A - → ""A"" is in the word but not at position 3.
- Position 4: N ✓ → The secret word has ""N"" at position 4.
- Position 5: E x → ""E"" is not in the word.

Constraints:
- The word must start with ""C"" and have ""N"" at position 4.
- ""A"" must be present, but not at position 3 → so it must be at position 2 or 5.
- ""R"" and ""E"" are absent.
- Position 3 cannot have ""A"" → possible letters are unknown.

Possible words:
- **CHINA**: C (1), H (2), I (3), N (4), A (5) → fits constraints (A at 5, not 4).
- **CANNA**: C (1), A (2), N (3), N (4), A (5) → fits constraints (A at 2 and 5, not 3).

Given that ""CHINA"" is a more common word, it is chosen as the second guess to test these possibilities:
- If correct, it wins.
- If incorrect, feedback on positions 2, 3, and 5 will help narrow it down (e.g., confirming ""CANNA"" or another word).",Guess 2: china -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
