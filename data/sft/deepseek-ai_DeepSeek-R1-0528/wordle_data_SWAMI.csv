We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can give us good information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common in English.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the word
 R(x) -> R is not in the word
 A(✓) -> A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3: since A is the third letter)
 N(x) -> N is not in the word
 E(x) -> E is not in the word

 The secret word has an A in the third position (since A is correct and in position). The word structure is: _ _ A _ _

 We know that C, R, N, E are not in the word. Therefore, we must avoid these letters.

 Since we have only one letter fixed (A in position 3), we need to choose a word that:
 1. Has A in the third position.
 2. Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of 5-letter words with A in the third position and without C, R, N, E.

 Some common letters to consider: S, T, L, O, P, M, B, D, G, etc.

 Example words: 
   ""STAIR"" -> but R is forbidden, so skip.
   ""PLAIT"" -> A is third, and letters P,L,A,I,T. Check forbidden: no C,R,N,E. So it's okay.

 But we have to consider that we only know A is in position 3. We don't know other letters.

 Another common word: ""SALAD"" -> has two A's? But note our feedback only showed the third position A. However, if there is another A, it wasn't indicated. But we don't have feedback for duplicate letters. However, since our feedback for the first guess had only one A (which was in the correct position), it might be that there is only one A? Not necessarily. It could have another A elsewhere, but in the ""crane"" guess, we didn't have another A to show.

 Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one A and it was correct. But if the secret word had another A in a wrong position, we would have seen a '-' for that A? However, in ""crane"", the A was only at position 3. We didn't have A elsewhere. So the secret word might have only one A? Or it might have more, but we can only see one because we only provided one A.

 Since we don't know about duplicates, we should be cautious.

 Actually, the rules do not specify how duplicates are handled, but typically in Wordle-style games, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback reflects each instance appropriately. However, in our feedback for ""crane"", we only have one A and it was a match. So if the secret word has two A's, then the other A must be in a position that we didn't guess with A? But we didn't try an A in other positions. So we cannot conclude that there is only one A.

 Therefore, we should consider that there might be an A in other positions? But note the third position is fixed. We know the A in the third position is there. We don't know about others.

 But for our next guess, we should avoid putting an A in a position where it might be incorrect? Or we can test if there is another A.

 Alternatively, we can try to get as much new information as possible.

 Let me list some words meeting the criteria:
   Position 1: not C,R,N,E; and not A? (because we don't know if the word has A in first position) but we can put any letter except C,R,N,E.
   Position 2: same, but we know it's not the third one (third is A).
   Position 3: must be A.
   Positions 4 and 5: any letter except C,R,N,E.

 Common words with A in third:
   ""PLAIT"" -> P L A I T
   ""TRAIL"" -> but contains R (forbidden) -> skip
   ""PLAIN"" -> contains N -> skip
   ""SHAWL"" -> S H A W L -> checks: no forbidden letters? C,R,N,E: none of these. So okay.
   ""STAID"" -> S T A I D -> S, T, A, I, D -> no forbidden letters? C,R,N,E: none? So S,T,A,I,D -> okay.

 However, note that we have only eliminated C,R,N,E. So we have to use other letters.

 Another idea: We want to test common consonants that haven't been tested yet: S, T, L, P, M, etc.

 Since we have position 3 fixed, let's focus on getting letters for positions 1, 2, 4, 5.

 I will consider ""PIANO"" -> but N is forbidden? Yes, we cannot use N. So skip.

 What about ""PASTA""? -> P A S T A -> but note: we are putting A in the second and third positions? 
   Position 1: P
   Position 2: A -> we don't know if the word has an A in position 2? 
   Position 3: A (fixed)
   Positions 4: T, 5: A? 
 But we are trying to test multiple positions? However, we must not use forbidden letters: P, S, T, A are allowed because C,R,N,E are forbidden, but P,S,T,A are not in that set.

 However, note that we already know A is in the word? And we have one A correctly placed. But if we put A in position 2 and 5, we might get feedback about those.

 But let's think: ""PASTA"" has three A's? But the secret word might not have that many? And we are limited to 5 letters.

 Alternatively, since we are only allowed to guess existing words, ""PASTA"" is valid.

 However, note our constraints: we must avoid C,R,N,E. PASTA has A (allowed), P, S, T. So okay.

 But wait: the feedback for our first guess showed A in the third position. If we put A in the second and fifth positions, then:
   If the secret word does not have an A in position 2, that A will get a '-' or an 'x'?
   Similarly, the fifth position A: if not present, it will be 'x'; if present but not in position, then '-'.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word without duplicate A to avoid confusion? But it might be useful to test.

 Considering maximizing information: we have positions 1,2,4,5 to get information. So if we pick a word with distinct letters in those positions, that would be better.

 So avoid duplicates? So let's pick a word with distinct letters except the A we know.

 For example: ""SHAWL"": S H A W L -> distinct letters? S,H,A,W,L? Yes.

 Another: ""STAID"": S T A I D -> distinct? S,T,A,I,D -> distinct.

 However, note that we don't know if the secret word has duplicates? But testing with distinct letters can help because if we get a match for a letter, we know it occurs only once? Not necessarily, but at least we avoid masking potential duplicates in the secret word? Actually, if we use a letter twice, we might get ambiguous feedback? So for maximum information, distinct letters are better.

 Therefore, I'll choose a word with A in third and four new distinct letters that are not C,R,N,E.

 Let's pick ""STAID"": S T A I D

 But note: we don't know if S, T, I, D are present? And we are testing these.

 However, note that in the secret word we know A is in position 3. We are putting S in position 1, T in position 2, A in position 3 (correct), I in position 4, D in position 5.

 This should work.

 But wait: if the secret word does not have S, T, I, or D, then we get feedback on each letter.

 So let me go with ""STAID"".

 Alternatively, ""PLAIN"" has an N -> forbidden. Skip.

 Another option: ""BLAST"" -> B L A S T -> but S at position 4 and T at position 5? And we have two S's? Wait, let's spell: B L A S T -> positions: B(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). So distinct? Yes, distinct letters: B, L, A, S, T. No duplicates. And no forbidden letters (C,R,N,E). So ""BLAST"" is another candidate.

 Which to choose? Both ""STAID"" and ""BLAST"" are valid.

 But note: we have already tried letter A (though we know it's in). The first guess had A in third, so we know that. The other letters: 
   In ""crane"": we had C, R, N, E -> no.
   In ""STAID"": S, T, I, D -> new.
   In ""BLAST"": B, L, S, T -> new.

 We want to test as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters in English: S, T, B, L, etc.

 So I think both are equally good? But let's consider the position of A: we know it's fixed at third.

 I think ""STAID"" is a valid word. And ""BLAST"" is also valid.

 How about ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> but E is forbidden? Yes, E is in the forbidden list. So skip.

 So we have two candidates: ""STAID"" and ""BLAST"".

 Alternatively, ""SALAD"": but has A twice -> S A L A D -> we already know one A, so we are introducing two additional A's? That might be redundant? But we are testing A in position 2 and 5? Not recommended because we are using two guesses for A? We already know A is present? So better to test other letters.

 Therefore, between ""STAID"" and ""BLAST"", which is better? 
   ""STAID"": letters S,T,A,I,D
   ""BLAST"": letters B,L,A,S,T -> note S and T are repeated? No: the letters are B,L,A,S,T -> distinct? Yes, all distinct.

 But both are distinct? Yes.

 However, note that ""STAID"" uses S and T, and ""BLAST"" also uses S and T. But ""BLAST"" uses B and L which are new? Wait, no: ""STAID"" uses I and D which are new? 

 Actually, we haven't tested any letters except C,R,A,N,E. So we are starting fresh.

 Since we are testing 4 new letters, they are both good.

 Let me choose ""BLAST"" because it has the very common letters S and T? But we already know that A is fixed.

 Or maybe choose one that doesn't reuse the S and T? Actually we are testing S in one position and T in another? Not a problem.

 Alternatively, what if we want to avoid letters that might be frequent? Actually, we want to test letters that are more frequent? So common letters are better.

 Based on English letter frequency, S and T are very common. Also, B and L are common.

 But ""BLAST"" has B,L,S,T and A? So four common letters.

 ""STAID"" has S,T,I,D and A? I and D are less common than B and L? 

 According to frequency: 
   S (6.3%), T (5.9%), B (1.7%), L (4.0%)
   I (6.2%), D (3.0%)

 Actually, both sets are good? Since I is around 6.2% and D 3.0%; B 1.7% and L 4.0%? So overall, ""STAID"" might test slightly higher frequency? 

 But note: we are testing position 1: both S and B are common starters? S is more common than B? Similarly? So I think both are acceptable.

 I think I'll pick ""BLAST"" because it also tests L which is common.

 But wait, we have position 1: B (less common) vs S (more common). But it's okay.

 Alternatively, let's pick ""PLAIT"": P L A I T -> distinct? P,L,A,I,T -> yes? And no forbidden? So it uses P, L, A, I, T.

 Or ""SLATE"": but L and T? S L A T E -> E is forbidden? Skip.

 Maybe ""SLANT"" -> N is forbidden? Skip.

 After consideration, let me go with ""BLAST"".

 Guess: BLAST

 We'll get feedback on: 
   B -> position 1: could be x or - or ✓
   L -> position 2: same?
   A -> position 3: ✓ (since we know A is in the word and position 3)
   S -> position 4: 
   T -> position 5: 

 But note: it's possible that secret word might not have B, L, S, T? We don't know.

 So let's choose ""BLAST"".

 However, note: we have to make sure the word is valid. I know that ""blast"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, next guess: BLAST

<guess>blast</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- A is in the word and correctly placed in position 3 (letters are 1-indexed, so pattern: _ _ A _ _).  
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word.  

For the next guess:  
1. Must place A in the 3rd position.  
2. Avoid using C, R, N, E.  
3. Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, B, L, P, D) to maximize information.  
4. Prefer distinct letters to avoid ambiguity and cover more ground.  

After evaluating words like ""STAID"", ""PLAIT"", and ""BLAST"":  
- Selected ""BLAST"" as it has distinct letters (B, L, A, S, T) covering high-frequency consonants.  
- Positions: B (1), L (2), A (3 ✓), S (4), T (5).  

This guess efficiently tests four new letters while respecting known constraints.  

<guess>blast</guess>",blast,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the word
 R(x) -> R is not in the word
 A(✓) -> A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3: since A is the third letter)
 N(x) -> N is not in the word
 E(x) -> E is not in the word

 The secret word has an A in the third position (since A is correct and in position). The word structure is: _ _ A _ _

 We know that C, R, N, E are not in the word. Therefore, we must avoid these letters.

 Since we have only one letter fixed (A in position 3), we need to choose a word that:
 1. Has A in the third position.
 2. Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of 5-letter words with A in the third position and without C, R, N, E.

 Some common letters to consider: S, T, L, O, P, M, B, D, G, etc.

 Example words: 
   ""STAIR"" -> but R is forbidden, so skip.
   ""PLAIT"" -> A is third, and letters P,L,A,I,T. Check forbidden: no C,R,N,E. So it's okay.

 But we have to consider that we only know A is in position 3. We don't know other letters.

 Another common word: ""SALAD"" -> has two A's? But note our feedback only showed the third position A. However, if there is another A, it wasn't indicated. But we don't have feedback for duplicate letters. However, since our feedback for the first guess had only one A (which was in the correct position), it might be that there is only one A?

But we didn't try an A in other positions. So we cannot conclude that there is only one A.

 Therefore, we should consider that there might be an A in other positions? But note the third position is fixed. We know the A in the third position is there. We don't know about others.

 But for our next guess, we should avoid putting an A in a position where it might be incorrect? Or we can test if there is another A.

 Alternatively, we can try to get as much new information as possible.

 Let me list some words meeting the criteria:
   Position 1: not C,R,N,E; and not A? (because we don't know if the word has A in first position) but we can put any letter except C,R,N,E.
   Position 2: same, but we know it's not the third one (third is A).
   Position 3: must be A.
   Positions 4 and 5: any letter except C,R,N,E.

 Common words with A in third:
   ""PLAIT"" -> P L A I T
   ""TRAIL"" -> but contains R (forbidden) -> skip
   ""PLAIN"" -> contains N -> skip
   ""SHAWL"" -> S H A W L -> checks: no forbidden letters? C,R,N,E: none of these. So okay.
   ""STAID"" -> S T A I D -> S, T, A, I, D -> no forbidden letters? C,R,N,E: none? So S,T,A,I,D -> okay.

 However, note that we have only eliminated C,R,N,E. So we have to use other letters.

 Another idea: We want to test common consonants that haven't been tested yet: S, T, L, P, M, etc.

 Since we have position 3 fixed, let's focus on getting letters for positions 1, 2, 4, 5.

 I will consider ""PIANO"" -> but N is forbidden? Yes, we cannot use N. So skip.

 What about ""PASTA""? -> P A S T A -> but note: we are putting A in the second and third positions? 
   Position 1: P
   Position 2: A -> we don't know if the word has an A in position 2? 
   Position 3: A (fixed)
   Positions 4: T, 5: A? 
 But we are trying to test multiple positions? However, we must not use forbidden letters: P, S, T, A are allowed because C,R,N,E are forbidden, but P,S,T,A are not in that set.

 However, note that we already know A is in the word? And we have one A correctly placed. But if we put A in position 2 and 5, we might get feedback about those.

 But let's think: ""PASTA"" has three A's? But the secret word might not have that many? And we are limited to 5 letters.

 Alternatively, since we are only allowed to guess existing words, ""PASTA"" is valid.

 However, note our constraints: we must avoid C,R,N,E. PASTA has A (allowed), P, S, T. So okay.

 But wait: the feedback for our first guess showed A in the third position. If we put A in the second and fifth positions, then:
   If the secret word does not have an A in position 2, that A will get a '-' or an 'x'?
   Similarly, the fifth position A: if not present, it will be 'x'; if present but not in position, then '-'.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word without duplicate A to avoid confusion? But it might be useful to test.

 Considering maximizing information: we have positions 1,2,4,5 to get information. So if we pick a word with distinct letters in those positions, that would be better.

 So avoid duplicates? So let's pick a word with distinct letters except the A we know.

 For example: ""SHAWL"": S H A W L -> distinct letters? S,H,A,W,L? Yes.

 Another: ""STAID"": S T A I D -> distinct? S,T,A,I,D -> distinct.

 However, note that we don't know if the secret word has duplicates? But testing with distinct letters can help because if we get a match for a letter, we know it occurs only once? Not necessarily, but at least we avoid masking potential duplicates in the secret word? Actually, if we use a letter twice, we might get ambiguous feedback? So for maximum information, distinct letters are better.

 Therefore, I'll choose a word with A in third and four new distinct letters that are not C,R,N,E.

 Let's pick ""STAID"": S T A I D

 But note: we don't know if S, T, I, D are present? And we are testing these.

 However, note that in the secret word we know A is in position 3. We are putting S in position 1, T in position 2, A in position 3 (correct), I in position 4, D in position 5.

 This should work.

 But wait: if the secret word does not have S, T, I, or D, then we get feedback on each letter.

 So let me go with ""STAID"".

 Alternatively, ""PLAIN"" has an N -> forbidden. Skip.

 Another option: ""BLAST"" -> B L A S T -> but S at position 4 and T at position 5? And we have two S's? Wait, let's spell: B L A S T -> positions: B(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). So distinct? Yes, distinct letters: B, L, A, S, T. No duplicates. And no forbidden letters (C,R,N,E). So ""BLAST"" is another candidate.

 Which to choose? Both ""STAID"" and ""BLAST"" are valid.

 But note: we have already tried letter A (though we know it's in). The first guess had A in third, so we know that. The other letters: 
   In ""crane"": we had C, R, N, E -> no.
   In ""STAID"": S, T, I, D -> new.
   In ""BLAST"": B, L, S, T -> new.

 We want to test as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters in English: S, T, B, L, etc.

 So I think both are equally good? But let's consider the position of A: we know it's fixed at third.

 I think ""STAID"" is a valid word. And ""BLAST"" is also valid.

 How about ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> but E is forbidden? Yes, E is in the forbidden list. So skip.

 So we have two candidates: ""STAID"" and ""BLAST"".

 Alternatively, ""SALAD"": but has A twice -> S A L A D -> we already know one A, so we are introducing two additional A's? That might be redundant? But we are testing A in position 2 and 5? Not recommended because we are using two guesses for A? We already know A is present? So better to test other letters.

 Therefore, between ""STAID"" and ""BLAST"", which is better? 
   ""STAID"": letters S,T,A,I,D
   ""BLAST"": letters B,L,A,S,T -> note S and T are repeated? No: the letters are B,L,A,S,T -> distinct? Yes, all distinct.

 But both are distinct? Yes.

 However, note that ""STAID"" uses S and T, and ""BLAST"" also uses S and T. But ""BLAST"" uses B and L which are new? Wait, no: ""STAID"" uses I and D which are new? 

 Actually, we haven't tested any letters except C,R,A,N,E. So we are starting fresh.

 Since we are testing 4 new letters, they are both good.

 Let me choose ""BLAST"" because it has the very common letters S and T? But we already know that A is fixed.

 Or maybe choose one that doesn't reuse the S and T? Actually we are testing S in one position and T in another? Not a problem.

 Alternatively, what if we want to avoid letters that might be frequent? Actually, we want to test letters that are more frequent? So common letters are better.

 Based on English letter frequency, S and T are very common. Also, B and L are common.

 But ""BLAST"" has B,L,S,T and A? So four common letters.

 ""STAID"" has S,T,I,D and A? I and D are less common than B and L? 

 According to frequency: 
   S (6.3%), T (5.9%), B (1.7%), L (4.0%)
   I (6.2%), D (3.0%)

 Actually, both sets are good? Since I is around 6.2% and D 3.0%; B 1.7% and L 4.0%? So overall, ""STAID"" might test slightly higher frequency? 

 But note: we are testing position 1: both S and B are common starters? S is more common than B? Similarly? So I think both are acceptable.

 I think I'll pick ""BLAST"" because it also tests L which is common.

 But wait, we have position 1: B (less common) vs S (more common). But it's okay.

 Alternatively, let's pick ""PLAIT"": P L A I T -> distinct? P,L,A,I,T -> yes? And no forbidden? So it uses P, L, A, I, T.

 Or ""SLATE"": but L and T? S L A T E -> E is forbidden? Skip.

 Maybe ""SLANT"" -> N is forbidden? Skip.

 After consideration, let me go with ""BLAST"".

 Guess: BLAST

 We'll get feedback on: 
   B -> position 1: could be x or - or ✓
   L -> position 2: same?
   A -> position 3: ✓ (since we know A is in the word and position 3)
   S -> position 4: 
   T -> position 5: 

 But note: it's possible that secret word might not have B, L, S, T? We don't know.

 So let's choose ""BLAST"".

 However, note: we have to make sure the word is valid. I know that ""blast"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, next guess: BLAST

<guess>blast</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- A is in the word and correctly placed in position 3 (letters are 1-indexed, so pattern: _ _ A _ _).  
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word.  

For the next guess:  
1. Must place A in the 3rd position.  
2. Avoid using C, R, N, E.  
3. Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, B, L, P, D) to maximize information.  
4. Prefer distinct letters to avoid ambiguity and cover more ground.  

After evaluating words like ""STAID"", ""PLAIT"", and ""BLAST"":  
- Selected ""BLAST"" as it has distinct letters (B, L, A, S, T) covering high-frequency consonants.  
- Positions: B (1), L (2), A (3 ✓), S (4), T (5).

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can give us good information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common in English.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the word
 R(x) -> R is not in the word
 A(✓) -> A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3: since A is the third letter)
 N(x) -> N is not in the word
 E(x) -> E is not in the word

 The secret word has an A in the third position (since A is correct and in position). The word structure is: _ _ A _ _

 We know that C, R, N, E are not in the word. Therefore, we must avoid these letters.

 Since we have only one letter fixed (A in position 3), we need to choose a word that:
 1. Has A in the third position.
 2. Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of 5-letter words with A in the third position and without C, R, N, E.

 Some common letters to consider: S, T, L, O, P, M, B, D, G, etc.

 Example words: 
   ""STAIR"" -> but R is forbidden, so skip.
   ""PLAIT"" -> A is third, and letters P,L,A,I,T. Check forbidden: no C,R,N,E. So it's okay.

 But we have to consider that we only know A is in position 3. We don't know other letters.

 Another common word: ""SALAD"" -> has two A's? But note our feedback only showed the third position A. However, if there is another A, it wasn't indicated. But we don't have feedback for duplicate letters. However, since our feedback for the first guess had only one A (which was in the correct position), it might be that there is only one A? Not necessarily. It could have another A elsewhere, but in the ""crane"" guess, we didn't have another A to show.

 Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one A and it was correct. But if the secret word had another A in a wrong position, we would have seen a '-' for that A? However, in ""crane"", the A was only at position 3. We didn't have A elsewhere. So the secret word might have only one A? Or it might have more, but we can only see one because we only provided one A.

 Since we don't know about duplicates, we should be cautious.

 Actually, the rules do not specify how duplicates are handled, but typically in Wordle-style games, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback reflects each instance appropriately. However, in our feedback for ""crane"", we only have one A and it was a match. So if the secret word has two A's, then the other A must be in a position that we didn't guess with A? But we didn't try an A in other positions. So we cannot conclude that there is only one A.

 Therefore, we should consider that there might be an A in other positions? But note the third position is fixed. We know the A in the third position is there. We don't know about others.

 But for our next guess, we should avoid putting an A in a position where it might be incorrect? Or we can test if there is another A.

 Alternatively, we can try to get as much new information as possible.

 Let me list some words meeting the criteria:
   Position 1: not C,R,N,E; and not A? (because we don't know if the word has A in first position) but we can put any letter except C,R,N,E.
   Position 2: same, but we know it's not the third one (third is A).
   Position 3: must be A.
   Positions 4 and 5: any letter except C,R,N,E.

 Common words with A in third:
   ""PLAIT"" -> P L A I T
   ""TRAIL"" -> but contains R (forbidden) -> skip
   ""PLAIN"" -> contains N -> skip
   ""SHAWL"" -> S H A W L -> checks: no forbidden letters? C,R,N,E: none of these. So okay.
   ""STAID"" -> S T A I D -> S, T, A, I, D -> no forbidden letters? C,R,N,E: none? So S,T,A,I,D -> okay.

 However, note that we have only eliminated C,R,N,E. So we have to use other letters.

 Another idea: We want to test common consonants that haven't been tested yet: S, T, L, P, M, etc.

 Since we have position 3 fixed, let's focus on getting letters for positions 1, 2, 4, 5.

 I will consider ""PIANO"" -> but N is forbidden? Yes, we cannot use N. So skip.

 What about ""PASTA""? -> P A S T A -> but note: we are putting A in the second and third positions? 
   Position 1: P
   Position 2: A -> we don't know if the word has an A in position 2? 
   Position 3: A (fixed)
   Positions 4: T, 5: A? 
 But we are trying to test multiple positions? However, we must not use forbidden letters: P, S, T, A are allowed because C,R,N,E are forbidden, but P,S,T,A are not in that set.

 However, note that we already know A is in the word? And we have one A correctly placed. But if we put A in position 2 and 5, we might get feedback about those.

 But let's think: ""PASTA"" has three A's? But the secret word might not have that many? And we are limited to 5 letters.

 Alternatively, since we are only allowed to guess existing words, ""PASTA"" is valid.

 However, note our constraints: we must avoid C,R,N,E. PASTA has A (allowed), P, S, T. So okay.

 But wait: the feedback for our first guess showed A in the third position. If we put A in the second and fifth positions, then:
   If the secret word does not have an A in position 2, that A will get a '-' or an 'x'?
   Similarly, the fifth position A: if not present, it will be 'x'; if present but not in position, then '-'.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word without duplicate A to avoid confusion? But it might be useful to test.

 Considering maximizing information: we have positions 1,2,4,5 to get information. So if we pick a word with distinct letters in those positions, that would be better.

 So avoid duplicates? So let's pick a word with distinct letters except the A we know.

 For example: ""SHAWL"": S H A W L -> distinct letters? S,H,A,W,L? Yes.

 Another: ""STAID"": S T A I D -> distinct? S,T,A,I,D -> distinct.

 However, note that we don't know if the secret word has duplicates? But testing with distinct letters can help because if we get a match for a letter, we know it occurs only once? Not necessarily, but at least we avoid masking potential duplicates in the secret word? Actually, if we use a letter twice, we might get ambiguous feedback? So for maximum information, distinct letters are better.

 Therefore, I'll choose a word with A in third and four new distinct letters that are not C,R,N,E.

 Let's pick ""STAID"": S T A I D

 But note: we don't know if S, T, I, D are present? And we are testing these.

 However, note that in the secret word we know A is in position 3. We are putting S in position 1, T in position 2, A in position 3 (correct), I in position 4, D in position 5.

 This should work.

 But wait: if the secret word does not have S, T, I, or D, then we get feedback on each letter.

 So let me go with ""STAID"".

 Alternatively, ""PLAIN"" has an N -> forbidden. Skip.

 Another option: ""BLAST"" -> B L A S T -> but S at position 4 and T at position 5? And we have two S's? Wait, let's spell: B L A S T -> positions: B(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). So distinct? Yes, distinct letters: B, L, A, S, T. No duplicates. And no forbidden letters (C,R,N,E). So ""BLAST"" is another candidate.

 Which to choose? Both ""STAID"" and ""BLAST"" are valid.

 But note: we have already tried letter A (though we know it's in). The first guess had A in third, so we know that. The other letters: 
   In ""crane"": we had C, R, N, E -> no.
   In ""STAID"": S, T, I, D -> new.
   In ""BLAST"": B, L, S, T -> new.

 We want to test as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters in English: S, T, B, L, etc.

 So I think both are equally good? But let's consider the position of A: we know it's fixed at third.

 I think ""STAID"" is a valid word. And ""BLAST"" is also valid.

 How about ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> but E is forbidden? Yes, E is in the forbidden list. So skip.

 So we have two candidates: ""STAID"" and ""BLAST"".

 Alternatively, ""SALAD"": but has A twice -> S A L A D -> we already know one A, so we are introducing two additional A's? That might be redundant? But we are testing A in position 2 and 5? Not recommended because we are using two guesses for A? We already know A is present? So better to test other letters.

 Therefore, between ""STAID"" and ""BLAST"", which is better? 
   ""STAID"": letters S,T,A,I,D
   ""BLAST"": letters B,L,A,S,T -> note S and T are repeated? No: the letters are B,L,A,S,T -> distinct? Yes, all distinct.

 But both are distinct? Yes.

 However, note that ""STAID"" uses S and T, and ""BLAST"" also uses S and T. But ""BLAST"" uses B and L which are new? Wait, no: ""STAID"" uses I and D which are new? 

 Actually, we haven't tested any letters except C,R,A,N,E. So we are starting fresh.

 Since we are testing 4 new letters, they are both good.

 Let me choose ""BLAST"" because it has the very common letters S and T? But we already know that A is fixed.

 Or maybe choose one that doesn't reuse the S and T? Actually we are testing S in one position and T in another? Not a problem.

 Alternatively, what if we want to avoid letters that might be frequent? Actually, we want to test letters that are more frequent? So common letters are better.

 Based on English letter frequency, S and T are very common. Also, B and L are common.

 But ""BLAST"" has B,L,S,T and A? So four common letters.

 ""STAID"" has S,T,I,D and A? I and D are less common than B and L? 

 According to frequency: 
   S (6.3%), T (5.9%), B (1.7%), L (4.0%)
   I (6.2%), D (3.0%)

 Actually, both sets are good? Since I is around 6.2% and D 3.0%; B 1.7% and L 4.0%? So overall, ""STAID"" might test slightly higher frequency? 

 But note: we are testing position 1: both S and B are common starters? S is more common than B? Similarly? So I think both are acceptable.

 I think I'll pick ""BLAST"" because it also tests L which is common.

 But wait, we have position 1: B (less common) vs S (more common). But it's okay.

 Alternatively, let's pick ""PLAIT"": P L A I T -> distinct? P,L,A,I,T -> yes? And no forbidden? So it uses P, L, A, I, T.

 Or ""SLATE"": but L and T? S L A T E -> E is forbidden? Skip.

 Maybe ""SLANT"" -> N is forbidden? Skip.

 After consideration, let me go with ""BLAST"".

 Guess: BLAST

 We'll get feedback on: 
   B -> position 1: could be x or - or ✓
   L -> position 2: same?
   A -> position 3: ✓ (since we know A is in the word and position 3)
   S -> position 4: 
   T -> position 5: 

 But note: it's possible that secret word might not have B, L, S, T? We don't know.

 So let's choose ""BLAST"".

 However, note: we have to make sure the word is valid. I know that ""blast"" is a valid English word.

That might be redundant? But we are testing A in position 2 and 5? Not recommended because we are using two guesses for A? We already know A is present? So better to test other letters.\n\n Therefore, between ""STAID"" and ""BLAST"", which is better? \n   ""STAID"": letters S,T,A,I,D\n   ""BLAST"": letters B,L,A,S,T -> note S and T are repeated? No: the letters are B,L,A,S,T -> distinct? Yes, all distinct.\n\n But both are distinct? Yes.\n\n However, note that ""STAID"" uses S and T, and ""BLAST"" also uses S and T. But ""BLAST"" uses B and L which are new? Wait, no: ""STAID"" uses I and D which are new? \n\n Actually, we haven\'t tested any letters except C,R,A,N,E. So we are starting fresh.\n\n Since we are testing 4 new letters, they are both good.\n\n Let me choose ""BLAST"" because it has the very common letters S and T? But we already know that A is fixed.\n\n Or maybe choose one that doesn\'t reuse the S and T? Actually we are testing S in one position and T in another? Not a problem.\n\n Alternatively, what if we want to avoid letters that might be frequent? Actually, we want to test letters that are more frequent? So common letters are better.\n\n Based on English letter frequency, S and T are very common. Also, B and L are common.\n\n But ""BLAST"" has B,L,S,T and A? So four common letters.\n\n ""STAID"" has S,T,I,D and A? I and D are less common than B and L? \n\n According to frequency: \n   S (6.3%), T (5.9%), B (1.7%), L (4.0%)\n   I (6.2%), D (3.0%)\n\n Actually, both sets are good? Since I is around 6.2% and D 3.0%; B 1.7% and L 4.0%? So overall, ""STAID"" might test slightly higher frequency? \n\n But note: we are testing position 1: both S and B are common starters? S is more common than B? Similarly? So I think both are acceptable.\n\n I think I\'ll pick ""BLAST"" because it also tests L which is common.\n\n But wait, we have position 1: B (less common) vs S (more common). But it\'s okay.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s pick ""PLAIT"": P L A I T -> distinct? P,L,A,I,T -> yes? And no forbidden? So it uses P, L, A, I, T.\n\n Or ""SLATE"": but L and T? S L A T E -> E is forbidden? Skip.\n\n Maybe ""SLANT"" -> N is forbidden? Skip.\n\n After consideration, let me go with ""BLAST"".\n\n Guess: BLAST\n\n We\'ll get feedback on: \n   B -> position 1: could be x or - or ✓\n   L -> position 2: same?\n   A -> position 3: ✓ (since we know A is in the word and position 3)\n   S -> position 4: \n   T -> position 5: \n\n But note: it\'s possible that secret word might not have B, L, S, T? We don\'t know.\n\n So let\'s choose ""BLAST"".\n\n However, note: we have to make sure the word is valid. I know that ""blast"" is a valid English word.\n\n Therefore, next guess: BLAST\n\n<guess>blast</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  \n- A is in the word and correctly placed in position 3 (letters are 1-indexed, so pattern: _ _ A _ _).  \n- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word.  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n1.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is correct and in the correct position (position 3).
- C, R, N, E are absent from the word.

Guess 2: ""blast"" -> B(x), L(x), A(✓), S(-), T(x)
Meaning:
- A is again correct and in position 3 (as expected).
- S is present but in the wrong position (since we got a '-'). So S is in the word, but not at position 4.
- B, L, T are absent.

So we know:
- The word has the letter S, but not in position 4.
- The word has A in position 3: so the pattern is _ _ A _ _
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, L, T

We also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Now, let's list the known absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, L, T.

We have one known present letter besides A: S (which is in the word but not at position 4).

We need to find a word that:
- Has A in position 3.
- Contains the letter S, but not at position 4.
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, L, T.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Possible positions for S: it can be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is A and position 4 we already tried and it was wrong).

But note: we don't know if S is in the word only once or multiple times. However, since we only have one S in our guess and it was marked as present (but wrong position), we know at least one S exists. But there could be more? We don't know.

We should consider that the word might have S in one of the positions: 1, 2, or 5.

Now, we need to choose a word that fits the constraints and tests new letters.

Let's think of common 5-letter words with A in the third position and containing S.

We must avoid: C, R, N, E, B, L, T.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the absent ones: 
Absent: B, C, E, L, N, R, T -> 7 letters.

So available: A, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we know A is in the word (at position 3) and S is in the word (somewhere not position 4).

We need to form a word: _ _ A _ _

We can put S in position 1, 2, or 5.

Let's try to list words:

Option 1: S in position 1: S _ A _ _
We need to fill the second, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the available set (and not the absent ones).

For example:
- S H A _ _ : possible words: SHADY, SHAGS, SHAKO, SHAWM, SHAWL (but L is absent) -> skip, SHAMS, SHAPE (E absent) -> skip, SHARD (R absent) -> skip, SHAME (E absent) -> skip.
  - SHADY: S H A D Y -> D and Y are available? D is available, Y is available. But we don't know if they are in the word. Also, note that we are testing new letters.
  - SHAMS: S H A M S -> but S at the end? And M is available. But note: we have two S's? That might be okay, but we are trying to get information. Also, if we use S twice, we might not get information about other letters.

But let's see: we want to test as many new letters as possible. So distinct letters are better.

SHADY: letters S, H, A, D, Y -> distinct? Yes, except A we know. So we test H, D, Y.

Similarly, SHAMS: S, H, A, M, S -> two S's. So we are testing H and M, but we are not testing the fifth letter because it's S again? So less information.

So SHADY is better.

Option 2: S in position 2: _ S A _ _
Possible words: 
  - P S A _ _ : PSA -> words like PSALM (but L and M? L is absent -> skip), PSHAW (H and W? but P S H A W -> W available, but note: we have to avoid absent letters. L is absent, but W is okay. However, PSHAW is a word? It's an interjection. But let's consider common words.
  - W S A _ _ : not common? 
  - M S A _ _ : MS -> M S A I D? But D available? MS is not common as a start? 
  - Actually, common words: USAGE (but E absent) -> skip, USAID (U, S, A, I, D -> but U and I and D available) -> USAID is a proper noun? Maybe not ideal. 
  - ISLET (but L and E absent) -> skip.

Not many common words with S in second position and A in third.

Option 3: S in position 5: _ _ A _ S
Possible words: 
  - _ _ A S S -> but we have two S's? And we don't know if the word has two S's? But we can try? 
  - More common: _ _ A M S -> words like DAMS, HAMS, JAMS, LAMS, PAMS, RAMS, TAMS, YAMS -> but we have to avoid absent letters: D, H, J, P, Y are available? But note: we are filling the first two letters.

But we need a 5-letter word: so the first two letters plus ""A"" and then the last two? Actually, the pattern is: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] S.

So for example:
- D A M A S? -> DAMAS? Not common.
- H A M A S -> HAMAS? Proper noun? 
- M A M A S -> MAMAS? But M A M A S -> M is repeated? And we have two A's? 
  - But note: we know A is in position 3. If we put A in position 2 and 5? That might be possible? But we don't know if the word has multiple A's.

But let's think of words ending with AS: 
- P I Z Z A S -> too long? 5 letters: so the word must be 5 letters.

Common words: 
- MANAS? M A N A S -> but N is absent -> skip.
- PAPAS? P A P A S -> P and A? But we have two P's and two A's? And S at the end. But N is absent? No, N is absent but we are not using N. P is available. But we have A in position 2? We don't know if that's allowed? We are testing.

But note: we have to avoid absent letters. So P is available? Yes.

But let's list without using absent letters: 
- Words like: D A I S Y -> but that's D A I S Y -> A is in position 2, not 3? We need A in position 3.

So for pattern _ _ A _ S:
- We can have: 
  - D _ A _ S: D? A? S? -> D? We can have D? But what words? DHAKS? Not common.
  - G A S A S? Not common.
  - K A M A S? K A M A S -> K and M? But A in position 2? We need A in position 3.

I think it's hard to find common words with S at the end and A in the third.

Alternatively, let's consider S in position 1: S _ A _ _

We had SHADY: S H A D Y -> which is a word.

Other options: 
- S K A _ _ : SKAG, SKAS, SKAT, SKAW -> but not 5 letters? SKATE -> E absent -> skip.
- S M A _ _ : SMACK (C absent) -> skip, SMALL (L absent) -> skip, SMART (R and T absent) -> skip, SMASH (H available) -> S M A S H -> but two S's? So we test M and H? But we are repeating S? So we get less information? 
  - But note: we are testing S in position 1 and 4? But we already know S is in the word? So if we put S in position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓, if not, we get a '-' or 'x'. But we know S is present, so it won't be 'x'. So we are testing the position of S? But we are also testing M and H.

But we have to consider: if we use S twice, the feedback might be ambiguous? For example, if the word has only one S, then one of the S's will be marked as absent? But we don't know how many S's are in the word.

To avoid confusion, it's better to use distinct letters.

So SHADY: S H A D Y -> distinct letters: S, H, A, D, Y -> we test H, D, Y.

We know A is fixed and S is present. So we are testing H, D, Y.

Another word: SHADY is good.

What about ""SHAPE""? But E is absent -> skip.

""SHADY"" seems a good candidate.

But note: we are putting S in position 1. We know S is in the word but not at position 4. It could be at position 1? So if we put it at position 1, we might get:
- If S is in position 1: then we get ✓ for S at position 1.
- If not, then we get '-' for S at position 1, meaning S is in the word but not at position 1 (so it must be at 2 or 5?).

So we are testing the position of S.

Similarly, we are testing H at position 2, D at position 4, Y at position 5.

We avoid absent letters.

Another candidate: ""SWAMI"" -> S W A M I -> distinct? S, W, A, M, I -> all distinct? Yes. And no absent letters? W, M, I are available.

But note: we are putting S at position 1 and A at 3. We are testing W at 2, M at 4, I at 5.

This is also good.

But we have two candidates: SHADY and SWAMI.

Which one to choose? Both test three new letters.

We can choose either. Let's see the letter frequency to maximize information.

Common letters: 
- H: 5.1% 
- D: 3.8%
- Y: 1.7%
- W: 1.5%
- M: 2.5%
- I: 7.5%

So SHADY tests H, D, Y: total frequency about 5.1+3.8+1.7 = 10.6%
SWAMI tests W, M, I: 1.5+2.5+7.5 = 11.5% -> slightly higher? But I is very common.

But note: we are also testing the position of S. So both are good.

Alternatively, we can consider if we want to avoid using Y because it's less common? But we have to test.

But I think SWAMI is a good choice because it tests I which is a vowel and common.

But wait: we haven't tested any vowels except A? We know A is in. We haven't tested O, U, I, etc. So testing I is good.

So I'll go with SWAMI.

But let me confirm: SWAMI is a valid word? Yes, meaning a Hindu religious teacher.

So guess: SWAMI

But note: we are putting S at position 1. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 1. So we are testing that.

Also, we are testing W at 2, M at 4, I at 5.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So let's choose SWAMI.

But wait: what if the word has S at position 1? Then we get a ✓ for S. If not, we get a '-' for S and then we know S must be at position 2 or 5? But we haven't tested position 5? We are testing position 1 now.

Alternatively, we could test S at position 5? But we don't have a good word for that.

So I think SWAMI is a good guess.

Therefore, next guess: SWAMI

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(✗), R(✗), A(✓), N(✗), E(✗)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is in the word and **correctly placed in position 3** (pattern: `_ _ A _ _`).  
  - C, R, N, E are **absent** from the word.  

- **Guess 2: BLAST**  
  Feedback: B(✗), L(✗), A(✓), S(-), T(✗)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is again **correctly placed in position 3** (consistent with Guess 1).  
  - S is **present but misplaced** (i.e., in the word but not in position 4).  
  - B, L, T are **absent**.  

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
1. **Position 3 must be A** (from both guesses).  
2. **S is in the word** but not in position 4 (from Guess 2).  
3. **Absent letters**: B, C, E, L, N, R, T (cannot be used).  
4. **Available positions for S**: Since position 3 is fixed as A and position 4 is invalid for S, S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
5. **Goal**: Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., I, O, U, D, M, P) to maximize information, while prioritizing distinct letters to avoid ambiguity.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test S in position 1** to check if it is correctly placed (if not, S must be in position 2 or 5).  
- **Avoid reused letters** (except A and S, which are confirmed present).  
- **Prioritize common vowels/consonants** not yet tested (e.g., I, O, U, D, M, P, W) to cover more ground.  
- **Candidate words**: Considered `SHADY` (tests H, D, Y) and `SWAMI` (tests W, M, I). Chose `SWAMI` because:  
  - Tests **I** (high-frequency vowel, 7.5% occurrence in English) and **M** (2.5%), providing broader coverage.  
  - Uses distinct letters (S, W, A, M, I), minimizing ambiguity in feedback.  
  - Puts S in position 1 to directly test its placement.  

### Why SWAMI?
- **S** in position 1: Tests if S is correctly placed.  
- **W** in position 2: New consonant test.  
- **A** in position 3: Fixed (known correct).  
- **M** in position 4: New consonant test.  
- **I** in position 5: New vowel test.  
- **All letters valid**: No B, C, E, L, N, R, T.  

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities while respecting all constraints.  

<guess>swami</guess>",swami,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is correct and in the correct position (position 3).
- C, R, N, E are absent from the word.

Guess 2: ""blast"" -> B(x), L(x), A(✓), S(-), T(x)
Meaning:
- A is again correct and in position 3 (as expected).
- S is present but in the wrong position (since we got a '-'). So S is in the word, but not at position 4.
- B, L, T are absent.

So we know:
- The word has the letter S, but not in position 4.
- The word has A in position 3: so the pattern is _ _ A _ _
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, L, T

We also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Now, let's list the known absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, L, T.

We have one known present letter besides A: S (which is in the word but not at position 4).

We need to find a word that:
- Has A in position 3.
- Contains the letter S, but not at position 4.
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, N, E, B, L, T.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Possible positions for S: it can be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is A and position 4 we already tried and it was wrong).

But note: we don't know if S is in the word only once or multiple times. However, since we only have one S in our guess and it was marked as present (but wrong position), we know at least one S exists. But there could be more? We don't know.

We should consider that the word might have S in one of the positions: 1, 2, or 5.

Now, we need to choose a word that fits the constraints and tests new letters.

Let's think of common 5-letter words with A in the third position and containing S.

We must avoid: C, R, N, E, B, L, T.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the absent ones: 
Absent: B, C, E, L, N, R, T -> 7 letters.

So available: A, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we know A is in the word (at position 3) and S is in the word (somewhere not position 4).

We need to form a word: _ _ A _ _

We can put S in position 1, 2, or 5.

Let's try to list words:

Option 1: S in position 1: S _ A _ _
We need to fill the second, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the available set (and not the absent ones).

For example:
- S H A _ _ : possible words: SHADY, SHAGS, SHAKO, SHAWM, SHAWL (but L is absent) -> skip, SHAMS, SHAPE (E absent) -> skip, SHARD (R absent) -> skip, SHAME (E absent) -> skip.
  - SHADY: S H A D Y -> D and Y are available? D is available, Y is available. But we don't know if they are in the word. Also, note that we are testing new letters.
  - SHAMS: S H A M S -> but S at the end? And M is available. But note: we have two S's? That might be okay, but we are trying to get information. Also, if we use S twice, we might not get information about other letters.

But let's see: we want to test as many new letters as possible. So distinct letters are better.

SHADY: letters S, H, A, D, Y -> distinct? Yes, except A we know. So we test H, D, Y.

Similarly, SHAMS: S, H, A, M, S -> two S's. So we are testing H and M, but we are not testing the fifth letter because it's S again? So less information.

So SHADY is better.

Option 2: S in position 2: _ S A _ _
Possible words: 
  - P S A _ _ : PSA -> words like PSALM (but L and M? L is absent -> skip), PSHAW (H and W? but P S H A W -> W available, but note: we have to avoid absent letters. L is absent, but W is okay. However, PSHAW is a word? It's an interjection. But let's consider common words.
  - W S A _ _ : not common? 
  - M S A _ _ : MS -> M S A I D? But D available? MS is not common as a start? 
  - Actually, common words: USAGE (but E absent) -> skip, USAID (U, S, A, I, D -> but U and I and D available) -> USAID is a proper noun? Maybe not ideal. 
  - ISLET (but L and E absent) -> skip.

Not many common words with S in second position and A in third.

Option 3: S in position 5: _ _ A _ S
Possible words: 
  - _ _ A S S -> but we have two S's? And we don't know if the word has two S's? But we can try? 
  - More common: _ _ A M S -> words like DAMS, HAMS, JAMS, LAMS, PAMS, RAMS, TAMS, YAMS -> but we have to avoid absent letters: D, H, J, P, Y are available? But note: we are filling the first two letters.

- M A M A S -> MAMAS? But M A M A S -> M is repeated? And we have two A's? 
  - But note: we know A is in position 3. If we put A in position 2 and 5? That might be possible? But we don't know if the word has multiple A's.

But let's think of words ending with AS: 
- P I Z Z A S -> too long? 5 letters: so the word must be 5 letters.

Common words: 
- MANAS? M A N A S -> but N is absent -> skip.
- PAPAS? P A P A S -> P and A? But we have two P's and two A's? And S at the end. But N is absent? No, N is absent but we are not using N. P is available. But we have A in position 2? We don't know if that's allowed? We are testing.

But note: we have to avoid absent letters. So P is available? Yes.

But let's list without using absent letters: 
- Words like: D A I S Y -> but that's D A I S Y -> A is in position 2, not 3? We need A in position 3.

So for pattern _ _ A _ S:
- We can have: 
  - D _ A _ S: D? A? S? -> D? We can have D? But what words? DHAKS? Not common.
  - G A S A S? Not common.
  - K A M A S? K A M A S -> K and M? But A in position 2? We need A in position 3.

I think it's hard to find common words with S at the end and A in the third.

Alternatively, let's consider S in position 1: S _ A _ _

We had SHADY: S H A D Y -> which is a word.

Other options: 
- S K A _ _ : SKAG, SKAS, SKAT, SKAW -> but not 5 letters? SKATE -> E absent -> skip.
- S M A _ _ : SMACK (C absent) -> skip, SMALL (L absent) -> skip, SMART (R and T absent) -> skip, SMASH (H available) -> S M A S H -> but two S's? So we test M and H? But we are repeating S? So we get less information? 
  - But note: we are testing S in position 1 and 4? But we already know S is in the word? So if we put S in position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓, if not, we get a '-' or 'x'. But we know S is present, so it won't be 'x'. So we are testing the position of S? But we are also testing M and H.

But we have to consider: if we use S twice, the feedback might be ambiguous? For example, if the word has only one S, then one of the S's will be marked as absent? But we don't know how many S's are in the word.

To avoid confusion, it's better to use distinct letters.

So SHADY: S H A D Y -> distinct letters: S, H, A, D, Y -> we test H, D, Y.

We know A is fixed and S is present. So we are testing H, D, Y.

Another word: SHADY is good.

What about ""SHAPE""? But E is absent -> skip.

""SHADY"" seems a good candidate.

But note: we are putting S in position 1. We know S is in the word but not at position 4. It could be at position 1? So if we put it at position 1, we might get:
- If S is in position 1: then we get ✓ for S at position 1.
- If not, then we get '-' for S at position 1, meaning S is in the word but not at position 1 (so it must be at 2 or 5?).

So we are testing the position of S.

Similarly, we are testing H at position 2, D at position 4, Y at position 5.

We avoid absent letters.

Another candidate: ""SWAMI"" -> S W A M I -> distinct? S, W, A, M, I -> all distinct? Yes. And no absent letters? W, M, I are available.

But note: we are putting S at position 1 and A at 3. We are testing W at 2, M at 4, I at 5.

This is also good.

But we have two candidates: SHADY and SWAMI.

Which one to choose? Both test three new letters.

We can choose either. Let's see the letter frequency to maximize information.

Common letters: 
- H: 5.1% 
- D: 3.8%
- Y: 1.7%
- W: 1.5%
- M: 2.5%
- I: 7.5%

So SHADY tests H, D, Y: total frequency about 5.1+3.8+1.7 = 10.6%
SWAMI tests W, M, I: 1.5+2.5+7.5 = 11.5% -> slightly higher? But I is very common.

But note: we are also testing the position of S. So both are good.

Alternatively, we can consider if we want to avoid using Y because it's less common? But we have to test.

But I think SWAMI is a good choice because it tests I which is a vowel and common.

But wait: we haven't tested any vowels except A? We know A is in. We haven't tested O, U, I, etc. So testing I is good.

So I'll go with SWAMI.

But let me confirm: SWAMI is a valid word? Yes, meaning a Hindu religious teacher.

So guess: SWAMI

But note: we are putting S at position 1. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 1. So we are testing that.

Also, we are testing W at 2, M at 4, I at 5.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So let's choose SWAMI.

But wait: what if the word has S at position 1? Then we get a ✓ for S. If not, we get a '-' for S and then we know S must be at position 2 or 5? But we haven't tested position 5? We are testing position 1 now.

Alternatively, we could test S at position 5? But we don't have a good word for that.

So I think SWAMI is a good guess.

Therefore, next guess: SWAMI

<guess>swami</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(✗), R(✗), A(✓), N(✗), E(✗)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is in the word and **correctly placed in position 3** (pattern: `_ _ A _ _`).  
  - C, R, N, E are **absent** from the word.  

- **Guess 2: BLAST**  
  Feedback: B(✗), L(✗), A(✓), S(-), T(✗)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is again **correctly placed in position 3** (consistent with Guess 1).  
  - S is **present but misplaced** (i.e., in the word but not in position 4).  
  - B, L, T are **absent**.  

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
1. **Position 3 must be A** (from both guesses).  
2. **S is in the word** but not in position 4 (from Guess 2).  
3. **Absent letters**: B, C, E, L, N, R, T (cannot be used).  
4. **Available positions for S**: Since position 3 is fixed as A and position 4 is invalid for S, S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
5. **Goal**: Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., I, O, U, D, M, P) to maximize information, while prioritizing distinct letters to avoid ambiguity.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test S in position 1** to check if it is correctly placed (if not, S must be in position 2 or 5).  
- **Avoid reused letters** (except A and S, which are confirmed present).  
- **Prioritize common vowels/consonants** not yet tested (e.g., I, O, U, D, M, P, W) to cover more ground.  
- **Candidate words**: Considered `SHADY` (tests H, D, Y) and `SWAMI` (tests W, M, I). Chose `SWAMI` because:  
  - Tests **I** (high-frequency vowel, 7.5% occurrence in English) and **M** (2.5%), providing broader coverage.  
  - Uses distinct letters (S, W, A, M, I), minimizing ambiguity in feedback.  
  - Puts S in position 1 to directly test its placement.  

### Why SWAMI?
- **S** in position 1: Tests if S is correctly placed.  
- **W** in position 2: New consonant test.  
- **A** in position 3: Fixed (known correct).  
- **M** in position 4: New consonant test.  
- **I** in position 5: New vowel test.  
- **All letters valid**: No B, C, E, L, N, R, T.  

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities while respecting all constraints.",Guess 3: swami -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) W(✓) A(✓) M(✓) I(✓),SUCCESS
