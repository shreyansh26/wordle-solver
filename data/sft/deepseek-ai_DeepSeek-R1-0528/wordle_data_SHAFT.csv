We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback. We need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common letters in English include vowels: A, E, I, O, U and consonants such as R, S, T, L, N.
 We also want to avoid repeating letters to maximize information.

 Considering these, I choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has the common letters C, R, A, N, E and includes three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so A is the second letter of the secret word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is A.
- Letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Since A is in the second position, the secret word has the form _ A _ _ _

We can eliminate any word containing C, R, N, E.

For the next guess, we want to use a word that:
- Has A in the second position (since we know it's correct).
- Uses other common letters to test for their presence.
- Avoids letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, U, etc.

Possible candidates: We need a 5-letter word with A in the second position.

Examples: 
- SALAD (but has A twice and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Actually, the feedback only mentioned positions, so duplicate letters might be possible. But in this case, we see that if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will indicate accordingly. However, in our first guess all letters were unique and we got one correct.)

But SALAD contains A twice? Actually, the word is S-A-L-A-D. But we don't know if the secret word has multiple A's. We should avoid using letters we know are absent? We know C, R, N, E are absent.

SALAD: S, A, L, A, D. A is repeated. Since A is known to be in the second position, and we don't know if there is another A, it might be acceptable. But we also need to test new letters.

However, let's think: we want maximum information. Using a word with mostly new letters would be better.

Other words with A in second position: 
- TABLE (but E is in the word, and we know E is absent -> so cannot use E)
- GAUDY (G-A-U-D-Y; U, D, Y are new; but avoid E? yes, and no C,R,N,E)

But we also know that the letter A is fixed in the second position.

We must avoid using C, R, N, E.

Let me list some words with A in the second position: PASTY, MAFIA, SAUNA, SAUCE (but C is banned), HAULM, etc.

Another good one: ""PASTA"" - but it has A twice? P-A-S-T-A. 
But we haven't tested P, S, T.

Alternatively, ""SALTY"": S-A-L-T-Y. This uses S, L, T, Y, all new. And avoids forbidden letters.

Another: ""HAPPY"" - H-A-P-P-Y, but has P twice? We want to test new letters so duplicates might reduce information.

So, ""SALTY"" seems good: S, A, L, T, Y. None of these are in the absent letters (C,R,N,E) and all are different.

But wait, we know that the word has an A in the second position, so SALTY: 
- S: first letter? We don't know if it's present or not.
- A: second position correct.
- L: third? 
- T: fourth?
- Y: fifth?

This will help us test S, L, T, Y.

Another candidate: ""TASTY"" - but T and A are repeated? T-A-S-T-Y: it has two T's. We want to avoid repeats unless necessary.

We could also try ""TIMID"" but I is in third position? Wait: T-I-M-I-D -> no, second letter must be A: so T-A-M-E-S? But E is banned.

Perhaps ""VALID"": V-A-L-I-D -> L and I are tested? But we don't know if vowels I might be present.

But note: we don't know if V, L, I, D are in the word or not.

But let's choose one that covers common letters.

Since we have limited information, we can start with SALTY, but note that it uses S and T, which are common.

Alternatively, ""DAISY"" -> D-A-I-S-Y: but D is new, I is new, S and Y? But note D-A-I-S-Y: second letter A. We know E is banned, so DAISY doesn't contain E? Actually, DAISY has no E, but we have D, I, S, Y. 

But we got E absent, so DAISY is okay? Wait, DAISY: D, A, I, S, Y.

But we also have a constraint: the first letter cannot be D? No, we don't know that. But we know D is not yet tested.

But we have an option.

Let me compare:

SALTY: letters S, A (fixed), L, T, Y
DAISY: D, A (fixed), I, S, Y

Which letters are more common? Both S and T are very common, so SALTY might be more informative? But S appears in both.

Alternatively, ""BASIC"" but C is banned -> can't use.

""JAZZY"" has Z repeated and isn't common.

""GAUDY"" we considered.

Another: ""PAINT"": P-A-I-N-T -> but N is banned (since first guess had N absent). So PAINT has N -> not allowed? We know N is absent? Yes, so cannot use N.

Similarly, ""FACET"" has F, A, C, E, T -> C and E are banned -> invalid.

So, avoiding N, E, C, R.

""VALID"": V-A-L-I-D -> acceptable? V, A, L, I, D. None are banned. 

""VALID"" might be a good choice? It tests V, L, I, D.

But we also want to test letters that are more common? L, I are common; V is less common; D is common too.

Alternatively, ""SALAD"": but two A's? S-A-L-A-D -> we test S, L, D? And A twice. But since A is already known, we might get information about whether another A exists? But that might complicate the feedback.

I think it's better to avoid duplicates for now to get maximum information per letter.

Therefore, words with 5 distinct letters avoiding C,R,N,E:

- SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y
- DAISY: D, A, I, S, Y
- VALID: V, A, L, I, D
- MAJOR: M,A,J,O,R -> R is banned? No, first guess had R absent, so R is not in the word -> banned. So MAJOR has R -> cannot use.

Similarly, words with R are banned.

So available words:

- SALTY: no banned letters? S, A, L, T, Y. S is not banned? Banned are C, R, N, E. S is not in banned list. Similarly L, T, Y are okay.

Another: ""BALMY"": B,A,L,M,Y -> checks B, L, M, Y.

But SALTY has T? Maybe T is more common than M.

After eliminating: I think SALTY is a good choice.

But let's check ""TIPSY"": T-I-P-S-Y -> second letter I? We need A in second position. So T-A-P-S-Y? But TAPYS isn't a word.

Another: ""HASTY"": H,A,S,T,Y -> same as SALTY? HASTY: H, A, S, T, Y. We test H, S, T, Y.

HASTY vs SALTY: SALTY has L, which HASTY doesn't. HASTY has H and S, T, Y.

Both seem good.

I choose SALTY because I prefer the letter L over H? How? Actually, both are valid.

But note: the first guess eliminated C,R,N,E. So we have more letters available.

We might also consider the frequency: In 5-letter words, letters near the beginning might be important? Or just overall.

Common letters: A is already known. Other common consonants: T, S, L, D, etc.

So SALTY covers S, L, T, Y.

Or DAISY covers D, I, S, Y.

I think SALTY is reasonable.

Alternatively, ""PALSY"": P,A,L,S,Y -> similar to SALTY but with P instead of T? T is more frequent than P? Actually, T is more common.

Therefore, SALTY: S in first position, A in second (fixed), L in third, T in fourth, Y in fifth.

This will tell us if S, L, T, Y are in the word and where.

So let's go with SALTY.

But wait: the word SALTY: if we test it, and for example, if the secret word has A in second, and if it has S, L, T, Y? But we don't know.

But that's the point.

Since A is fixed, we can also consider words that don't have A in the middle? No, because A is in the second position, we must reuse that known position to get more feedback.

So yes.

Thus, my second guess is ""SALTY"".

Wait, but SALTY has two positions for A? Actually, SALTY: 
Position 1: S
Position 2: A (fixed, so we know this is correct)
Position 3: L
Position 4: T
Position 5: Y

So no duplicate A? SALTY has only one A? Yes: S, A, L, T, Y -> one A.

I think I confused with SALAD.

So SALTY is fine.

Alternatively, we could try a word that might be the actual word? But we don't have enough info.

Guess: SALTY

But let me confirm: 
- Avoids C,R,N,E: Yes.
- Uses new common letters: S, L, T, Y.
- A in the correct position.

So, I think this is a good second guess.

Therefore, we'll go with SALTY.
</think>
After the first guess ""CRANE"" with feedback indicating that only the letter 'A' is correct and in the second position, and letters 'C', 'R', 'N', 'E' are not in the word:
- The secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ _
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E (these cannot appear anywhere in the word).
- The next guess should focus on testing new common consonants and vowels (avoiding eliminated letters) while keeping 'A' in the second position to maximize information.

For the second guess:
- Chose ""SALTY"" because:
  - It has 'A' fixed in the second position (required by feedback).
  - It uses new common letters: S, L, T, Y (all distinct and untested).
  - It avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).
- Testing S, L, T, Y will provide insight into their presence and positions.

 Considering these, I choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has the common letters C, R, A, N, E and includes three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so A is the second letter of the secret word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is A.
- Letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Since A is in the second position, the secret word has the form _ A _ _ _

We can eliminate any word containing C, R, N, E.

For the next guess, we want to use a word that:
- Has A in the second position (since we know it's correct).
- Uses other common letters to test for their presence.
- Avoids letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, U, etc.

Possible candidates: We need a 5-letter word with A in the second position.

Examples: 
- SALAD (but has A twice and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Actually, the feedback only mentioned positions, so duplicate letters might be possible. But in this case, we see that if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will indicate accordingly. However, in our first guess all letters were unique and we got one correct.)

But SALAD contains A twice? Actually, the word is S-A-L-A-D. But we don't know if the secret word has multiple A's. We should avoid using letters we know are absent? We know C, R, N, E are absent.

SALAD: S, A, L, A, D. A is repeated. Since A is known to be in the second position, and we don't know if there is another A, it might be acceptable. But we also need to test new letters.

However, let's think: we want maximum information. Using a word with mostly new letters would be better.

Other words with A in second position: 
- TABLE (but E is in the word, and we know E is absent -> so cannot use E)
- GAUDY (G-A-U-D-Y; U, D, Y are new; but avoid E? yes, and no C,R,N,E)

But we also know that the letter A is fixed in the second position.

We must avoid using C, R, N, E.

Let me list some words with A in the second position: PASTY, MAFIA, SAUNA, SAUCE (but C is banned), HAULM, etc.

Another good one: ""PASTA"" - but it has A twice? P-A-S-T-A. 
But we haven't tested P, S, T.

Alternatively, ""SALTY"": S-A-L-T-Y. This uses S, L, T, Y, all new. And avoids forbidden letters.

Another: ""HAPPY"" - H-A-P-P-Y, but has P twice? We want to test new letters so duplicates might reduce information.

So, ""SALTY"" seems good: S, A, L, T, Y. None of these are in the absent letters (C,R,N,E) and all are different.

But wait, we know that the word has an A in the second position, so SALTY: 
- S: first letter? We don't know if it's present or not.
- A: second position correct.
- L: third? 
- T: fourth?
- Y: fifth?

This will help us test S, L, T, Y.

Another candidate: ""TASTY"" - but T and A are repeated? T-A-S-T-Y: it has two T's. We want to avoid repeats unless necessary.

We could also try ""TIMID"" but I is in third position? Wait: T-I-M-I-D -> no, second letter must be A: so T-A-M-E-S? But E is banned.

Perhaps ""VALID"": V-A-L-I-D -> L and I are tested? But we don't know if vowels I might be present.

But note: we don't know if V, L, I, D are in the word or not.

But let's choose one that covers common letters.

Since we have limited information, we can start with SALTY, but note that it uses S and T, which are common.

Alternatively, ""DAISY"" -> D-A-I-S-Y: but D is new, I is new, S and Y? But note D-A-I-S-Y: second letter A. We know E is banned, so DAISY doesn't contain E? Actually, DAISY has no E, but we have D, I, S, Y. 

But we got E absent, so DAISY is okay? Wait, DAISY: D, A, I, S, Y.

But we also have a constraint: the first letter cannot be D? No, we don't know that. But we know D is not yet tested.

But we have an option.

Let me compare:

SALTY: letters S, A (fixed), L, T, Y
DAISY: D, A (fixed), I, S, Y

Which letters are more common? Both S and T are very common, so SALTY might be more informative? But S appears in both.

Alternatively, ""BASIC"" but C is banned -> can't use.

""JAZZY"" has Z repeated and isn't common.

""GAUDY"" we considered.

Another: ""PAINT"": P-A-I-N-T -> but N is banned (since first guess had N absent). So PAINT has N -> not allowed? We know N is absent? Yes, so cannot use N.

Similarly, ""FACET"" has F, A, C, E, T -> C and E are banned -> invalid.

So, avoiding N, E, C, R.

""VALID"": V-A-L-I-D -> acceptable? V, A, L, I, D. None are banned. 

""VALID"" might be a good choice? It tests V, L, I, D.

But we also want to test letters that are more common? L, I are common; V is less common; D is common too.

Alternatively, ""SALAD"": but two A's? S-A-L-A-D -> we test S, L, D? And A twice. But since A is already known, we might get information about whether another A exists? But that might complicate the feedback.

I think it's better to avoid duplicates for now to get maximum information per letter.

Therefore, words with 5 distinct letters avoiding C,R,N,E:

- SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y
- DAISY: D, A, I, S, Y
- VALID: V, A, L, I, D
- MAJOR: M,A,J,O,R -> R is banned? No, first guess had R absent, so R is not in the word -> banned. So MAJOR has R -> cannot use.

Similarly, words with R are banned.

So available words:

- SALTY: no banned letters? S, A, L, T, Y. S is not banned? Banned are C, R, N, E. S is not in banned list. Similarly L, T, Y are okay.

Another: ""BALMY"": B,A,L,M,Y -> checks B, L, M, Y.

But SALTY has T? Maybe T is more common than M.

After eliminating: I think SALTY is a good choice.

But let's check ""TIPSY"": T-I-P-S-Y -> second letter I? We need A in second position. So T-A-P-S-Y? But TAPYS isn't a word.

Another: ""HASTY"": H,A,S,T,Y -> same as SALTY? HASTY: H, A, S, T, Y. We test H, S, T, Y.

HASTY vs SALTY: SALTY has L, which HASTY doesn't. HASTY has H and S, T, Y.

Both seem good.

I choose SALTY because I prefer the letter L over H? How? Actually, both are valid.

But note: the first guess eliminated C,R,N,E. So we have more letters available.

We might also consider the frequency: In 5-letter words, letters near the beginning might be important? Or just overall.

Common letters: A is already known. Other common consonants: T, S, L, D, etc.

So SALTY covers S, L, T, Y.

Or DAISY covers D, I, S, Y.

I think SALTY is reasonable.

Alternatively, ""PALSY"": P,A,L,S,Y -> similar to SALTY but with P instead of T? T is more frequent than P? Actually, T is more common.

Therefore, SALTY: S in first position, A in second (fixed), L in third, T in fourth, Y in fifth.

This will tell us if S, L, T, Y are in the word and where.

So let's go with SALTY.

But wait: the word SALTY: if we test it, and for example, if the secret word has A in second, and if it has S, L, T, Y? But we don't know.

But that's the point.

Since A is fixed, we can also consider words that don't have A in the middle? No, because A is in the second position, we must reuse that known position to get more feedback.

So yes.

Thus, my second guess is ""SALTY"".

Wait, but SALTY has two positions for A? Actually, SALTY: 
Position 1: S
Position 2: A (fixed, so we know this is correct)
Position 3: L
Position 4: T
Position 5: Y

So no duplicate A? SALTY has only one A? Yes: S, A, L, T, Y -> one A.

I think I confused with SALAD.

So SALTY is fine.

Alternatively, we could try a word that might be the actual word? But we don't have enough info.

Guess: SALTY

But let me confirm: 
- Avoids C,R,N,E: Yes.
- Uses new common letters: S, L, T, Y.
- A in the correct position.

So, I think this is a good second guess.

Therefore, we'll go with SALTY.After the first guess ""CRANE"" with feedback indicating that only the letter 'A' is correct and in the second position, and letters 'C', 'R', 'N', 'E' are not in the word:
- The secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ _
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E (these cannot appear anywhere in the word).
- The next guess should focus on testing new common consonants and vowels (avoiding eliminated letters) while keeping 'A' in the second position to maximize information.

For the second guess:
- Chose ""SALTY"" because:
  - It has 'A' fixed in the second position (required by feedback).
  - It uses new common letters: S, L, T, Y (all distinct and untested).
  - It avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).
- Testing S, L, T, Y will provide insight into their presence and positions.

We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Second letter is A. So the word is _ A _ _ _
- Letters C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SALTY -> S(✓), A(-), L(x), T(-), Y(x)
Meaning:
- S is in the correct position (position 1). So the first letter is S.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position. But wait, from the first guess, we know A is in position 2. Now, in SALTY, A is in position 2 again, but the feedback says ""-"" which means wrong position? That contradicts!

But note: the feedback says A(-) which means the letter A is present but not in this position. However, we know that A must be in position 2 because of the first feedback. So this suggests that the secret word has at least two A's? Because A is in position 2 (as per first guess) but in this second guess, when we placed A in position 2 again, it says it is present but wrong position? That implies that for this particular occurrence (the one in position 2 in SALTY) it's not correct, but since we know it was correct in the first guess, the only explanation is that there is another A in a different position? But let me analyze carefully.

Actually, the feedback per letter is for that specific instance. In the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was marked correct (✓). Now, in the second guess, we have A again in position 2, but now marked as ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in this position? This is inconsistent because if the second letter is A (fixed from first guess), then every time we place A in position 2, it should be ✓. Unless... the rules must account for multiple occurrences.

Clarification from rules: when a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky. But in this case:

- The secret word must have A in position 2, so if we place A in position 2, it should get ✓ unless the secret word does not have A in that position? But we know it does from first guess.

Therefore, the feedback for A in SALTY must be ✓? But the feedback says A(-). This is a contradiction.

Unless... I misread the feedback. The feedback for SALTY is:

S(✓) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)

And for the first guess, A was in position 2 and marked ✓.

The only logical explanation is that the secret word has only one A, but it has been moved? But that can't be, because we fixed it in position 2. Alternatively, there was an error in the feedback? But I think we must trust the feedback.

Another possibility: the secret word has two A's. In the first guess (CRANE), the A in position 2 matched one of them. In the second guess (SALTY), the A in position 2 does not match because the second A is different? No, the same letter A.

But actually, the feedback is given per position. For SALTY:

- S in position 1: is in the correct position? Given ✓, so the first letter must be S? Then the word is S A _ _ _ but wait, we already thought second letter A.

But now, the second letter A was marked ""-"", meaning it's not in the right position? Even though it was confirmed to be in the right position before?

Therefore, the secret word must have at least two A's.

Explanation with an example: suppose the secret word is something like ""SAUCE"", but we know C and E are absent? So not possible.

Let's assume the secret word has two A's. Then:

First guess CRANE: A in position 2 -> the secret word has A in position 2? But if there is only one A, then it must be in position 2. If there are two A's, then the first feedback for A: position 2 matches, so ✓.

Second guess SALTY: A in position 2. If the secret word has another A, then this A could be matching a different occurrence? But wait, the second occurrence might be in a different position. However, when we place A in position 2, if the secret word has A in position 2, then that specific occurrence should get ✓. But if the secret word does not have an A in position 2? But it must because of the first guess.

Unless the feedback for duplicate letters works as follows: if a guess has duplicate letters, the feedback might be assigned to different occurrences. But SALTY has only one A.

So SALTY: we placed an A in position 2. Since the secret word has A in position 2 (from first feedback), this should be ✓, but in the feedback it's marked ""-"".

This is impossible.

Therefore, there is an error in my reasoning or the feedback.

Alternate interpretation: Perhaps the first guess feedback was not binding the second letter forever? But no, unless the word changes? It doesn't.

So the only remaining possibility is that the secret word has at least two A's. And in the first guess, when we placed A in position 2, it matched one occurrence. In the second guess, when we placed A in position 2, it matches the same occurrence? So it should still be ✓. But the feedback says ""-"", meaning not in position 2? Contradiction.

Perhaps the rules: if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will show for each occurrence. But SALTY has only one A. For the feedback to show A(-), it means that A is in the secret word but not in position 2? But it must be in position 2.

So I'm stuck.

Another idea: maybe the feedback for SALTY is telling us that the first letter is S, but the second letter is not A? But from the first guess, we know the second letter is A.

Let me parse the feedback literally.

Guess 2: SALTY
- Letter 1: S (position 1) -> ✓
- Letter 2: A (position 2) -> -  (present but wrong position)
- Letter 3: L (position 3) -> x
- Letter 4: T (position 4) -> - 
- Letter 5: Y (position 5) -> x

But feedback for A says it's in the word but not in this position. Even though we know from guess 1 that position 2 is A? So how can position 2 not be A? Only if the secret word has changed or something? No.

The only resolution is that there are two A's in the secret word, and in this guess, the A at position 2 is not the one that was previously at position 2, but wait, same letter.

Perhaps the secret word is ""SAHAB"" or something? But letters must be standard.

Moreover, we know that in the first guess, A at position 2 was correct, so the secret word has A at position 2. In SALTY, A at position 2 is exactly that same letter, so it should be correct.

But the feedback contradicts.

Unless the feedback is relative to this guess only, and the earlier feedback is not to be used? No, previous feedback is to be used.

So I think there must be an error in my assumption about duplicate letters.

Let's look for official Wordle rules on duplicate letters.

In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times in the guess, and thesecret word has fewer, it might be marked for the first occurrence only, but if the secret word has multiple, then it can match.

But here, our guess doesn't have duplicate letters. SALTY has no duplicate letters.

So no issue.

Perhaps the feedback for A in SALTY is for the specific instance. And since the secret word has only one A, and we placed it in position 2, but the secret word's A is at position 2, so it should be marked . Why ""-""?

This is a puzzle. Perhaps the word ""CRANE"" had an A which was at position 2 and correct, but that doesn't mean there is only one A. Maybe the secret word has A in position 2 and another A elsewhere.

In SALTY, we have A in position 2. The secret word has A in position 2 and also in another position. But the feedback for position 2: since we placed A there and there is an A there, it should be ✓. Unless they mark it only for the first occurrence?

But rules say: ""the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position"" for ""-"". For a correct position, it should be ✓.

Perhaps the secret word does not have an A in position 2? But guess 1 said A is correct and in position 2.

So let's assume the feedback for guess 2 takes precedence or there's a mistake.

But I think I must accept the feedback as given. So according to guess 2: S(✓) and A(-) means the first letter is S, and A is in the word but not at position 2. But this conflicts with guess 1 where A at position 2 was correct.

The only way to resolve is that the secret word has at least two A's. In guess 1, when we had A in position 2, it matched the secret word's A in position 2. In guess 2, when we have A in position 2, but now the secret word's A in position 2 has already been ""used"" or something? But that doesn't make sense.

In some Wordle implementations, if there are duplicate letters, and you guess a letter in a position where it is correct, it counts. But in this case, since we are using the same position, it should be correct.

I think I need to proceed with the given feedback.

So from guess 2 feedback:

- S is in the correct position (1), so first letter is S.
- A is in the word but not in position 2. (This is new information that contradicts previous knowledge? Or we have to integrate it.)
- L is not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- Y is not in the word.

But guess 1 said position 2 is A. Now according to this, position 2 is not A? How can both be true?

Unless the secret word is such that: from guess 1, the second letter is A, so the word is _ A _ _ _ . But from guess 2, we have S at position 1 which is ✓, so the word is S A _ _ _ . Then we have A at position 2, and feedback says it's not in that position? But that position 2 is A.

 The feedback for A in guess 2 says ""-"", which by the rules means ""the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position"". So it must be that the secret word has an A, but not in position 2.

 But we know from guess 1 that there is an A in position 2.

 Therefore, the secret word has at least two A's. And in guess 2, when we placed A at position 2, they are using that to indicate one of the other A's? But the rules are not clear on this.

 Standard Wordle behavior: if the guess has a letter that is in the word at a different position, it gets ""-"", and if in the correct position, it gets ""✓"". For duplicate letters, it's matched in order.

 However, in this case, the secret word has A at position 2, but for some reason, in guess 2, it's marked as ""-"" for position 2? That should not happen.

 Given the confusion, we must trust the feedback: so for guess 2, A at position 2 is not correct, meaning the secret word does not have A at position 2. But guess 1 said it does.

 This is logically impossible.

 Alternatively, I misread the feedback.

 The feedback for guess 2 is: S(✓) for letter 1, A(-) for letter 2, etc.

 And for guess 1, the feedback was A(✓) for letter 3? No: CRANE has positions:
 C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5)

 Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)

 So for guess 1:
- Position 3: A is correct.

 So the secret word has A in position 3, not position 2. In a 5-letter word, positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

 I think I made a mistake: in CRANE, the sequence is:
 1: C
 2: R
 3: A
 4: N
 5: E

 Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)

 Therefore, the third letter is A, so the word is _ _ A _ _

 Then, for guess 2: SALTY
 1: S
 2: A
 3: L
 4: T
 5: Y
 Feedback: S(✓) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)

 Now, S(✓) at position 1: so first letter is S.
 A(-) at position 2: A is in the word but not in position 2.
 And L not in word, T in word but not position 4, Y not in word.

 Also, from guess 1, we know the third letter is A.

 So putting together:
- First letter: S (from guess 2)
- Third letter: A (from guess 1)
- Second letter is not A (from guess 2), but we already knew it wasn't from guess 1 R(x) and now A(-) confirms that the letter there is not A, and A is not in second position.

 So the word is S ? A _ _

 Also, we know that C, R, N, E are absent (from guess 1).

 From guess 2: L and Y are absent.
 T is present but not in position 4.

 So the word is: S _ A _ _

 Letters present in word: S (first), A (third), T (somewhere not position 4), and possibly others.

 Letters absent: C, R, N, E, L, Y.

 From positions: position 4 might not be T, and position 5 is not yet known.

 Also, since T is present and not in position 4, it must be in position 2 or 5? But position 3 is A, and position 1 is S, so T must be in position 2 or 5.

 But position 4 could be something else, but T is not there.

 Also, we need to include the two new pieces of information: T must be in the word (since it's marked ""-""), and we now know A is not in position 2 (which we already knew).

Possible letters: after two guesses, eliminated: C,R,N,E,L,Y.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

And we must include T.

For the next guess, we want to test:
- Position 2: it's not T? Could be.
- Position 4: not T.
- Position 5: unknown.

Also, to cover more common letters.

A good guess should have:
- S at position 1 (already fixed)
- ? at position 2
- A at position 3 (already fixed)
- ? at position 4
- ? at position 5

And test position 2 and 5, and also check for T's position? And 4.

Since we know T is in the word, and not in position 4, we should try to place T in position 2 or 5 in our guess to see if it fits.

Alternatively, we can test multiple letters.

But we already have S and A fixed.

So let's construct a word: S ? A ? ?

With ? not in eliminated letters: C,R,N,E,L,Y eliminated.

And T must appear somewhere.

Possible words:

- STAFF? But F repeated, not efficient. Anyway, letters: S-T-A-F-F. F is new. But position 2 is T, position 4 is F, position 5 is F.

But we don't know if F is in word or not.

Or ""STAND"" but N is eliminated.

""STAMP"": S-T-A-M-P -> tests T in pos 2, M in 4, P in 5. M and P are new.

Other options: ""STAKE"" -> but E is eliminated, cannot use E.

""STAID"": S-T-A-I-D -> I and D new.

""STAIR"" but R is eliminated.

""SOAPY"" but Y is eliminated? Y is eliminated according to guess 2.

""SHADY"" -- H and D, but Y eliminated? Y is absent.

So avoid Y.

""SCABY"" -- C eliminated.

Possible good words: ""SAD"", but that's 3 letters. ""SABER"" -- B and E, but E is eliminated.

""SAT"" is 3 letters.

""STACK"" -- C and K? C eliminated.

Let's think: ""STADIA"" too long.

 common words: ""STAFF"", but we try to avoid duplicates.

""STACK"" not allowed (C).

""STAKE"" not allowed (E).

""STAGE"": S-T-A-G-E -> E eliminated.

""STAID"": S-T-A-I-D -> letters T, I, D. Allowed? T is in pos 2? But T is present and not at 4; if it is at 2, then at pos 2 it should be marked correct if we guess.

But in guess 2, T was at pos 4 and marked ""-"", so in another position.

We are going to place T at pos 2 now to test.

Similarly, ""STAIN"" has N.

"" STAUD "" not a word.

"" STAW "" not 5 letters.

""STAPH"": S-T-A-P-H -> H is new.

Or ""STAPHY"" too long.

5-letter words: ""STAPS""? Not common.

""STAIR"" -> R eliminated.

Another word: ""SWAMI"": S-W-A-M-I -> W, M, I new, but position 3 is A? This word is S-W-A-M-I, so second letter W, third letter A, fourth M, fifth I. So W at pos 2.

But in this case, T is in the word but not placed anywhere? We need to include T to see if it fits position 5 or so.

But if we don't include T, then we won't know if T is in position 5 or not.

In the secret word, T is present, but in a position other than 4. Possible positions: 2 or 5.

We can try a word that has T in position 5 or 2.

But we also want to test other letters for position 2 and 5.

Since position 3 is fixed A, position 1 fixed S, we can focus on the remaining letters.

The unknown positions are 2,4,5.

T is in one of 2,5? Or could it be in 4? Feedback said T not in position 4, so 2 or 5.

So let's make a guess that places T in position 2 to test.

If the secret word has T in position 2, then we get a ✓ for it. If not, thenT must be in 5.

So one strategy is to test T at position 2.

Also include common vowels like O or I.

For example: ""STACK"" no because C eliminated.

""STADE"" E eliminated.

""STAFF"": S,T,A,F,F -- but F repeated.

""STAFF"" is a valid word, but two F's. If the secret word has only one F, then it will be marked accordingly.

We could try ""SAPID"": S-A-P-I-D -> positions: S1, A2, P3, I4, D5. This doesn't have A in position 3? Position 3 would be P, but we need A in position 3? No, the secret word has A in position 3.

In ""SAPID"": 
1. S -> fixed correct
2. A -> not fixed? The secret word has A in position 3, so position 2 should not be A? Actually.
In ""SAPID"", letter at position 3 is P, but we know position 3 must be A? So we cannot try SAPID because position 3 is P, not A.

We must have position 3 as A in every guess? Because it is correct.

Yes, the strategy is to keep fixed to get information on remaining positions.

So for position 3: A must be present; for now we know it's fixed at position 3.

So in the word, position 3 is A.

So for our guess, it should be: S ? A ? ?

? being letters not C,R,N,E,L,Y.

And T must appear in the word? Yes, present somewhere.

And T is not in position 4, so T must be in position 2 or position 5.

So let's place T in one of these.

Option 1: Place T in position 2 -> word: ""S T A _ _""

But what for 4 and 5? Must choose available letters.

For example: ""ST A F F"" -> STAFF

Or ""ST A M P"" -> STAMP

Or ""ST A L K"" but L eliminated and K? L is eliminated? From guess 2 L(x) so L not in word.

Also Y eliminated.

So ""STAMP"" : S, T, A, M, P

Checks M and P, new letters.

""STAFF"": S, T, A, F, F

But F repeated.

I think ""STAMP"" is better.

Option 2: Place T in position 5: then word: ""S ? A ? T""

? must not be T? But position 2 could be something else.

For example: ""S H A M T"" -> not common word we know.

Or ""S I A M T"" - not a word.

Better is: ""S W A M T"" -> not common.

""S H A P T"" -> SHAPT not a word.

""S K A T E"" -> E eliminated.

To place T in position 5, we have: ""S _ A _ T""

With position 2 and 4 to fill: but must be a word.

Possible: ""SPLAT"" but L eliminated and P? L eliminated.

""SCRAT"" C eliminated and R elim.

""S K I A T"" -> not positions.

Common words: ""S C A T S"" -> C elim.

"" S W A T T "" -> has two T's.

But T in pos 5.

""SWART"" -> R eliminated.

 I think it's hard with T at the end.

So go back to placing T in position 2.

So ""STAMP"" seems a good candidate: S(1), T(2), A(3), M(4), P(5)

But in guess 2, we had T at position 4 marked ""-"", so T is in the word but not at position 4. If we place T at position 2 and it is correct, then we're lucky. If not, then T must be at position 5.

In this guess, we can test position 2 with T, and also test M and P for positions 4 and 5.

If the secret word is ""STAMP"", then we win.

Otherwise, we get more feedback.

Another possibility: ""STAID"" with T at 2: positions 2=T, 4=I, 5=D.

But STAID: S-T-A-I-D.

Test I and D.

Both seem good.

Or ""STA N D"" -> N eliminated.

So STAID is a possibility.

I think STAID and STAMP are both good.

But consider: ""STAID"" uses I and D, and ""STAMP"" uses M and P. Which has more common letters? I and D are common, M and P also.

Other options: ""STA G E"" -> E elim.

""STALK"" L elim.

So let's go with ""STAID"" for more vowels.

But STAID: S-T-A-I-D.

Position 3 is A, fixed.

Note that position 4 is I, a vowel, position 5 D.

Also, T at position 2.

So we can try this.

Or to not place T prematurely, we could choose a word that doesn't have T but tests position 2 and 5 differently? But T must be in a position we haven't tested, either 2 or 5.

If we don't include T, then the feedback won't tell us where T is? But if we include T, we can tell.

But perhaps use a word with T in position 5.

For example: ""S O A P T""  - not a word? 
""SPOAT"" not a word.

""S K A L T"" L elim.

Another word: ""SOUTH"" not.

""S H A F T"" - SHAFT is a word? S, H, A, F, T. But position 2 is H, position 4 is F, position 5 is T. And position 3 is A fixed. So SHAFT.

This tests H at position 2, F at position 4, T at position 5.

Since T is present, And not at 4, so at position 5 it should be correct if appropriate.

We can use SHAFT.

But is SHAFT common? It is a English word.

In SHAFT:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: F
- Position 5: T

We will get feedback on H, F, T.

Since we know T is present, if at position 5 we put T, it might be correct or not.

Similarly, F and H are new.

Let's decide between STAID, STAMP, or SHAFT.

Another word: ""SHAPT"" not a word.

I think STAID is widely accepted as a word meaning sedate, respectable.

Similarly, STAMP is common.

SHAFT is also common.

But in terms of information: STAID places T at position 2. SHAFT places T at position 5.

Since we want to find out where T is, either way is useful.

But let me choose STAMP for its commonality.

So to guess: STAMP

<guess>STAMP</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: Letters C, R, N, E are absent from the word (x). Letter A is present and in the correct position (✓), revealing that the 3rd letter is A. Therefore, the secret word has the form _ _ A _ _.
- **Guess 2 (SALTY)**: 
  - S is present and in the correct position (✓), revealing that the 1st letter is S.
  - A is present but in the wrong position (-). However, since we know A must be in position 3, this implies the secret word has at least two A's, and one of them is in position 3.
  - L and Y are absent (x).
  - T is present (-) but not in position 4.

Constraints identified:
- **Known Positions**: 1st letter is S, 3rd letter is A → Secret word format: S _ A _ _.
- **Present Letters (must be included)**: A (due to multiple occurrences), T (and T cannot be in position 4).
- **Absent Letters (cannot be included)**: C, R, N, E, L, Y.
- **Possible Positions for T**: Must be in position 2 or 5 (only remaining positions, since it can't be in 4).
- **Other Positions**: Test position 2 and 5, and determine the letter at position 4.

For the next guess:
- **Strategy**: Place T in position 2 to test if it belongs there, as it is a high-frequency letter and must appear. This helps narrow down the letter at position 5. Use common English letters not yet tested or eliminated (avoiding C, R, N, E, L, Y).
- **Chosen Word: STAMP**
  - S (1st position): Confirmed correct (from previous feedback).
  - T (2nd position): Tests if T is in position 2.
  - A (3rd position): Confirmed correct.
  - M (4th position): Tests a new common consonant.
  - P (5th position): Tests a new common consonant.
- **Advantages**: 
  - Efficiently tests T in position 2 while covering new letters (M and P).
  - If T is not in position 2, the feedback will confirm it must be in position 5.

<guess>STAMP</guess>",STAMP,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Second letter is A. So the word is _ A _ _ _
- Letters C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SALTY -> S(✓), A(-), L(x), T(-), Y(x)
Meaning:
- S is in the correct position (position 1). So the first letter is S.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position. But wait, from the first guess, we know A is in position 2. Now, in SALTY, A is in position 2 again, but the feedback says ""-"" which means wrong position? That contradicts!

But note: the feedback says A(-) which means the letter A is present but not in this position. However, we know that A must be in position 2 because of the first feedback. So this suggests that the secret word has at least two A's? Because A is in position 2 (as per first guess) but in this second guess, when we placed A in position 2 again, it says it is present but wrong position? That implies that for this particular occurrence (the one in position 2 in SALTY) it's not correct, but since we know it was correct in the first guess, the only explanation is that there is another A in a different position? But let me analyze carefully.

Actually, the feedback per letter is for that specific instance. In the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was marked correct (✓). Now, in the second guess, we have A again in position 2, but now marked as ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in this position? This is inconsistent because if the second letter is A (fixed from first guess), then every time we place A in position 2, it should be ✓. Unless... the rules must account for multiple occurrences.

Clarification from rules: when a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky. But in this case:

- The secret word must have A in position 2, so if we place A in position 2, it should get ✓ unless the secret word does not have A in that position? But we know it does from first guess.

Therefore, the feedback for A in SALTY must be ✓? But the feedback says A(-). This is a contradiction.

Unless... I misread the feedback. The feedback for SALTY is:

S(✓) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)

And for the first guess, A was in position 2 and marked ✓.

The only logical explanation is that the secret word has only one A, but it has been moved? But that can't be, because we fixed it in position 2. Alternatively, there was an error in the feedback? But I think we must trust the feedback.

Another possibility: the secret word has two A's. In the first guess (CRANE), the A in position 2 matched one of them. In the second guess (SALTY), the A in position 2 does not match because the second A is different? No, the same letter A.

But actually, the feedback is given per position. For SALTY:

- S in position 1: is in the correct position? Given ✓, so the first letter must be S? Then the word is S A _ _ _ but wait, we already thought second letter A.

But now, the second letter A was marked ""-"", meaning it's not in the right position? Even though it was confirmed to be in the right position before?

Therefore, the secret word must have at least two A's.

Explanation with an example: suppose the secret word is something like ""SAUCE"", but we know C and E are absent? So not possible.

Let's assume the secret word has two A's. Then:

First guess CRANE: A in position 2 -> the secret word has A in position 2? But if there is only one A, then it must be in position 2. If there are two A's, then the first feedback for A: position 2 matches, so ✓.

Second guess SALTY: A in position 2. If the secret word has another A, then this A could be matching a different occurrence? But wait, the second occurrence might be in a different position. However, when we place A in position 2, if the secret word has A in position 2, then that specific occurrence should get ✓. But if the secret word does not have an A in position 2? But it must because of the first guess.

Unless the feedback for duplicate letters works as follows: if a guess has duplicate letters, the feedback might be assigned to different occurrences. But SALTY has only one A.

So SALTY: we placed an A in position 2. Since the secret word has A in position 2 (from first feedback), this should be ✓, but in the feedback it's marked ""-"".

This is impossible.

Therefore, there is an error in my reasoning or the feedback.

Alternate interpretation: Perhaps the first guess feedback was not binding the second letter forever? But no, unless the word changes? It doesn't.

So the only remaining possibility is that the secret word has at least two A's. And in the first guess, when we placed A in position 2, it matched one occurrence. In the second guess, when we placed A in position 2, it matches the same occurrence? So it should still be ✓. But the feedback says ""-"", meaning not in position 2? Contradiction.

Perhaps the rules: if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will show for each occurrence. But SALTY has only one A. For the feedback to show A(-), it means that A is in the secret word but not in position 2? But it must be in position 2.

So I'm stuck.

Another idea: maybe the feedback for SALTY is telling us that the first letter is S, but the second letter is not A? But from the first guess, we know the second letter is A.

Let me parse the feedback literally.

Guess 2: SALTY
- Letter 1: S (position 1) -> ✓
- Letter 2: A (position 2) -> -  (present but wrong position)
- Letter 3: L (position 3) -> x
- Letter 4: T (position 4) -> - 
- Letter 5: Y (position 5) -> x

But feedback for A says it's in the word but not in this position. Even though we know from guess 1 that position 2 is A? So how can position 2 not be A? Only if the secret word has changed or something? No.

The only resolution is that there are two A's in the secret word, and in this guess, the A at position 2 is not the one that was previously at position 2, but wait, same letter.

Perhaps the secret word is ""SAHAB"" or something? But letters must be standard.

Moreover, we know that in the first guess, A at position 2 was correct, so the secret word has A at position 2. In SALTY, A at position 2 is exactly that same letter, so it should be correct.

But the feedback contradicts.

Unless the feedback is relative to this guess only, and the earlier feedback is not to be used? No, previous feedback is to be used.

So I think there must be an error in my assumption about duplicate letters.

Let's look for official Wordle rules on duplicate letters.

In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times in the guess, and thesecret word has fewer, it might be marked for the first occurrence only, but if the secret word has multiple, then it can match.

But here, our guess doesn't have duplicate letters. SALTY has no duplicate letters.

So no issue.

Perhaps the feedback for A in SALTY is for the specific instance. And since the secret word has only one A, and we placed it in position 2, but the secret word's A is at position 2, so it should be marked . Why ""-""?

This is a puzzle. Perhaps the word ""CRANE"" had an A which was at position 2 and correct, but that doesn't mean there is only one A. Maybe the secret word has A in position 2 and another A elsewhere.

In SALTY, we have A in position 2. The secret word has A in position 2 and also in another position. But the feedback for position 2: since we placed A there and there is an A there, it should be ✓. Unless they mark it only for the first occurrence?

But rules say: ""the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position"" for ""-"". For a correct position, it should be ✓.

Perhaps the secret word does not have an A in position 2? But guess 1 said A is correct and in position 2.

So let's assume the feedback for guess 2 takes precedence or there's a mistake.

But I think I must accept the feedback as given. So according to guess 2: S(✓) and A(-) means the first letter is S, and A is in the word but not at position 2. But this conflicts with guess 1 where A at position 2 was correct.

The only way to resolve is that the secret word has at least two A's. In guess 1, when we had A in position 2, it matched the secret word's A in position 2. In guess 2, when we have A in position 2, but now the secret word's A in position 2 has already been ""used"" or something? But that doesn't make sense.

In some Wordle implementations, if there are duplicate letters, and you guess a letter in a position where it is correct, it counts. But in this case, since we are using the same position, it should be correct.

I think I need to proceed with the given feedback.

So from guess 2 feedback:

- S is in the correct position (1), so first letter is S.
- A is in the word but not in position 2. (This is new information that contradicts previous knowledge? Or we have to integrate it.)
- L is not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- Y is not in the word.

But guess 1 said position 2 is A. Now according to this, position 2 is not A? How can both be true?

Unless the secret word is such that: from guess 1, the second letter is A, so the word is _ A _ _ _ . But from guess 2, we have S at position 1 which is ✓, so the word is S A _ _ _ . Then we have A at position 2, and feedback says it's not in that position? But that position 2 is A.

 The feedback for A in guess 2 says ""-"", which by the rules means ""the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position"". So it must be that the secret word has an A, but not in position 2.

 But we know from guess 1 that there is an A in position 2.

 Therefore, the secret word has at least two A's. And in guess 2, when we placed A at position 2, they are using that to indicate one of the other A's? But the rules are not clear on this.

 Standard Wordle behavior: if the guess has a letter that is in the word at a different position, it gets ""-"", and if in the correct position, it gets ""✓"". For duplicate letters, it's matched in order.

 However, in this case, the secret word has A at position 2, but for some reason, in guess 2, it's marked as ""-"" for position 2? That should not happen.

 Given the confusion, we must trust the feedback: so for guess 2, A at position 2 is not correct, meaning the secret word does not have A at position 2. But guess 1 said it does.

 This is logically impossible.

 Alternatively, I misread the feedback.

 The feedback for guess 2 is: S(✓) for letter 1, A(-) for letter 2, etc.

 And for guess 1, the feedback was A(✓) for letter 3? No: CRANE has positions:
 C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5)

 Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)

 So for guess 1:
- Position 3: A is correct.

 So the secret word has A in position 3, not position 2. In a 5-letter word, positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

 I think I made a mistake: in CRANE, the sequence is:
 1: C
 2: R
 3: A
 4: N
 5: E

 Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)

 Therefore, the third letter is A, so the word is _ _ A _ _

 Then, for guess 2: SALTY
 1: S
 2: A
 3: L
 4: T
 5: Y
 Feedback: S(✓) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)

 Now, S(✓) at position 1: so first letter is S.
 A(-) at position 2: A is in the word but not in position 2.
 And L not in word, T in word but not position 4, Y not in word.

 Also, from guess 1, we know the third letter is A.

 So putting together:
- First letter: S (from guess 2)
- Third letter: A (from guess 1)
- Second letter is not A (from guess 2), but we already knew it wasn't from guess 1 R(x) and now A(-) confirms that the letter there is not A, and A is not in second position.

 So the word is S ? A _ _

 Also, we know that C, R, N, E are absent (from guess 1).

 From guess 2: L and Y are absent.
 T is present but not in position 4.

 So the word is: S _ A _ _

 Letters present in word: S (first), A (third), T (somewhere not position 4), and possibly others.

 Letters absent: C, R, N, E, L, Y.

 From positions: position 4 might not be T, and position 5 is not yet known.

 Also, since T is present and not in position 4, it must be in position 2 or 5? But position 3 is A, and position 1 is S, so T must be in position 2 or 5.

 But position 4 could be something else, but T is not there.

 Also, we need to include the two new pieces of information: T must be in the word (since it's marked ""-""), and we now know A is not in position 2 (which we already knew).

Possible letters: after two guesses, eliminated: C,R,N,E,L,Y.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

And we must include T.

For the next guess, we want to test:
- Position 2: it's not T? Could be.
- Position 4: not T.
- Position 5: unknown.

Also, to cover more common letters.

A good guess should have:
- S at position 1 (already fixed)
- ? at position 2
- A at position 3 (already fixed)
- ? at position 4
- ? at position 5

And test position 2 and 5, and also check for T's position? And 4.

Since we know T is in the word, and not in position 4, we should try to place T in position 2 or 5 in our guess to see if it fits.

Alternatively, we can test multiple letters.

But we already have S and A fixed.

So let's construct a word: S ? A ? ?

With ? not in eliminated letters: C,R,N,E,L,Y eliminated.

And T must appear somewhere.

Possible words:

- STAFF? But F repeated, not efficient. Anyway, letters: S-T-A-F-F. F is new. But position 2 is T, position 4 is F, position 5 is F.

But we don't know if F is in word or not.

Or ""STAND"" but N is eliminated.

""STAMP"": S-T-A-M-P -> tests T in pos 2, M in 4, P in 5. M and P are new.

Other options: ""STAKE"" -> but E is eliminated, cannot use E.

""STAID"": S-T-A-I-D -> I and D new.

""STAIR"" but R is eliminated.

""SOAPY"" but Y is eliminated? Y is eliminated according to guess 2.

""SHADY"" -- H and D, but Y eliminated? Y is absent.

So avoid Y.

""SCABY"" -- C eliminated.

Possible good words: ""SAD"", but that's 3 letters. ""SABER"" -- B and E, but E is eliminated.

""SAT"" is 3 letters.

""STACK"" -- C and K? C eliminated.

Let's think: ""STADIA"" too long.

 common words: ""STAFF"", but we try to avoid duplicates.

""STACK"" not allowed (C).

""STAKE"" not allowed (E).

""STAGE"": S-T-A-G-E -> E eliminated.

""STAID"": S-T-A-I-D -> letters T, I, D. Allowed? T is in pos 2? But T is present and not at 4; if it is at 2, then at pos 2 it should be marked correct if we guess.

But in guess 2, T was at pos 4 and marked ""-"", so in another position.

We are going to place T at pos 2 now to test.

Similarly, ""STAIN"" has N.

"" STAUD "" not a word.

"" STAW "" not 5 letters.

""STAPH"": S-T-A-P-H -> H is new.

Or ""STAPHY"" too long.

5-letter words: ""STAPS""? Not common.

""STAIR"" -> R eliminated.

Another word: ""SWAMI"": S-W-A-M-I -> W, M, I new, but position 3 is A? This word is S-W-A-M-I, so second letter W, third letter A, fourth M, fifth I. So W at pos 2.

But in this case, T is in the word but not placed anywhere? We need to include T to see if it fits position 5 or so.

But if we don't include T, then we won't know if T is in position 5 or not.

In the secret word, T is present, but in a position other than 4. Possible positions: 2 or 5.

We can try a word that has T in position 5 or 2.

But we also want to test other letters for position 2 and 5.

Since position 3 is fixed A, position 1 fixed S, we can focus on the remaining letters.

The unknown positions are 2,4,5.

T is in one of 2,5? Or could it be in 4? Feedback said T not in position 4, so 2 or 5.

So let's make a guess that places T in position 2 to test.

If the secret word has T in position 2, then we get a ✓ for it. If not, thenT must be in 5.

So one strategy is to test T at position 2.

Also include common vowels like O or I.

For example: ""STACK"" no because C eliminated.

""STADE"" E eliminated.

""STAFF"": S,T,A,F,F -- but F repeated.

""STAFF"" is a valid word, but two F's. If the secret word has only one F, then it will be marked accordingly.

We could try ""SAPID"": S-A-P-I-D -> positions: S1, A2, P3, I4, D5. This doesn't have A in position 3? Position 3 would be P, but we need A in position 3? No, the secret word has A in position 3.

In ""SAPID"": 
1. S -> fixed correct
2. A -> not fixed? The secret word has A in position 3, so position 2 should not be A? Actually.
In ""SAPID"", letter at position 3 is P, but we know position 3 must be A? So we cannot try SAPID because position 3 is P, not A.

We must have position 3 as A in every guess? Because it is correct.

Yes, the strategy is to keep fixed to get information on remaining positions.

So for position 3: A must be present; for now we know it's fixed at position 3.

So in the word, position 3 is A.

So for our guess, it should be: S ? A ? ?

? being letters not C,R,N,E,L,Y.

And T must appear in the word? Yes, present somewhere.

And T is not in position 4, so T must be in position 2 or position 5.

So let's place T in one of these.

Option 1: Place T in position 2 -> word: ""S T A _ _""

But what for 4 and 5? Must choose available letters.

For example: ""ST A F F"" -> STAFF

Or ""ST A M P"" -> STAMP

Or ""ST A L K"" but L eliminated and K? L is eliminated? From guess 2 L(x) so L not in word.

Also Y eliminated.

So ""STAMP"" : S, T, A, M, P

Checks M and P, new letters.

""STAFF"": S, T, A, F, F

But F repeated.

I think ""STAMP"" is better.

Option 2: Place T in position 5: then word: ""S ? A ? T""

? must not be T? But position 2 could be something else.

For example: ""S H A M T"" -> not common word we know.

Or ""S I A M T"" - not a word.

Better is: ""S W A M T"" -> not common.

""S H A P T"" -> SHAPT not a word.

""S K A T E"" -> E eliminated.

To place T in position 5, we have: ""S _ A _ T""

With position 2 and 4 to fill: but must be a word.

Possible: ""SPLAT"" but L eliminated and P? L eliminated.

""SCRAT"" C eliminated and R elim.

""S K I A T"" -> not positions.

Common words: ""S C A T S"" -> C elim.

"" S W A T T "" -> has two T's.

But T in pos 5.

""SWART"" -> R eliminated.

 I think it's hard with T at the end.

So go back to placing T in position 2.

So ""STAMP"" seems a good candidate: S(1), T(2), A(3), M(4), P(5)

But in guess 2, we had T at position 4 marked ""-"", so T is in the word but not at position 4. If we place T at position 2 and it is correct, then we're lucky. If not, then T must be at position 5.

In this guess, we can test position 2 with T, and also test M and P for positions 4 and 5.

If the secret word is ""STAMP"", then we win.

Otherwise, we get more feedback.

Another possibility: ""STAID"" with T at 2: positions 2=T, 4=I, 5=D.

But STAID: S-T-A-I-D.

Test I and D.

Both seem good.

Or ""STA N D"" -> N eliminated.

So STAID is a possibility.

I think STAID and STAMP are both good.

But consider: ""STAID"" uses I and D, and ""STAMP"" uses M and P. Which has more common letters? I and D are common, M and P also.

Other options: ""STA G E"" -> E elim.

""STALK"" L elim.

So let's go with ""STAID"" for more vowels.

But STAID: S-T-A-I-D.

Position 3 is A, fixed.

Note that position 4 is I, a vowel, position 5 D.

Also, T at position 2.

So we can try this.

Or to not place T prematurely, we could choose a word that doesn't have T but tests position 2 and 5 differently? But T must be in a position we haven't tested, either 2 or 5.

If we don't include T, then the feedback won't tell us where T is? But if we include T, we can tell.

But perhaps use a word with T in position 5.

For example: ""S O A P T""  - not a word? 
""SPOAT"" not a word.

""S K A L T"" L elim.

Another word: ""SOUTH"" not.

""S H A F T"" - SHAFT is a word? S, H, A, F, T. But position 2 is H, position 4 is F, position 5 is T. And position 3 is A fixed. So SHAFT.

This tests H at position 2, F at position 4, T at position 5.

Since T is present, And not at 4, so at position 5 it should be correct if appropriate.

We can use SHAFT.

But is SHAFT common? It is a English word.

In SHAFT:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: F
- Position 5: T

We will get feedback on H, F, T.

Since we know T is present, if at position 5 we put T, it might be correct or not.

Similarly, F and H are new.

Let's decide between STAID, STAMP, or SHAFT.

Another word: ""SHAPT"" not a word.

I think STAID is widely accepted as a word meaning sedate, respectable.

Similarly, STAMP is common.

SHAFT is also common.

But in terms of information: STAID places T at position 2. SHAFT places T at position 5.

Since we want to find out where T is, either way is useful.

But let me choose STAMP for its commonality.

So to guess: STAMP

<guess>STAMP</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: Letters C, R, N, E are absent from the word (x). Letter A is present and in the correct position (✓), revealing that the 3rd letter is A. Therefore, the secret word has the form _ _ A _ _.
- **Guess 2 (SALTY)**: 
  - S is present and in the correct position (✓), revealing that the 1st letter is S.
  - A is present but in the wrong position (-). However, since we know A must be in position 3, this implies the secret word has at least two A's, and one of them is in position 3.
  - L and Y are absent (x).
  - T is present (-) but not in position 4.

Constraints identified:
- **Known Positions**: 1st letter is S, 3rd letter is A → Secret word format: S _ A _ _.
- **Present Letters (must be included)**: A (due to multiple occurrences), T (and T cannot be in position 4).
- **Absent Letters (cannot be included)**: C, R, N, E, L, Y.
- **Possible Positions for T**: Must be in position 2 or 5 (only remaining positions, since it can't be in 4).
- **Other Positions**: Test position 2 and 5, and determine the letter at position 4.

For the next guess:
- **Strategy**: Place T in position 2 to test if it belongs there, as it is a high-frequency letter and must appear. This helps narrow down the letter at position 5. Use common English letters not yet tested or eliminated (avoiding C, R, N, E, L, Y).
- **Chosen Word: STAMP**
  - S (1st position): Confirmed correct (from previous feedback).
  - T (2nd position): Tests if T is in position 2.
  - A (3rd position): Confirmed correct.
  - M (4th position): Tests a new common consonant.
  - P (5th position): Tests a new common consonant.
- **Advantages**: 
  - Efficiently tests T in position 2 while covering new letters (M and P).
  - If T is not in position 2, the feedback will confirm it must be in position 5.",Guess 3: STAMP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) A(✓) M(x) P(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback. We need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common letters in English include vowels: A, E, I, O, U and consonants such as R, S, T, L, N.
 We also want to avoid repeating letters to maximize information.

 Considering these, I choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has the common letters C, R, A, N, E and includes three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so A is the second letter of the secret word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is A.
- Letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Since A is in the second position, the secret word has the form _ A _ _ _

We can eliminate any word containing C, R, N, E.

For the next guess, we want to use a word that:
- Has A in the second position (since we know it's correct).
- Uses other common letters to test for their presence.
- Avoids letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, U, etc.

Possible candidates: We need a 5-letter word with A in the second position.

Examples: 
- SALAD (but has A twice and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Actually, the feedback only mentioned positions, so duplicate letters might be possible. But in this case, we see that if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will indicate accordingly. However, in our first guess all letters were unique and we got one correct.)

But SALAD contains A twice? Actually, the word is S-A-L-A-D. But we don't know if the secret word has multiple A's. We should avoid using letters we know are absent? We know C, R, N, E are absent.

SALAD: S, A, L, A, D. A is repeated. Since A is known to be in the second position, and we don't know if there is another A, it might be acceptable. But we also need to test new letters.

However, let's think: we want maximum information. Using a word with mostly new letters would be better.

Other words with A in second position: 
- TABLE (but E is in the word, and we know E is absent -> so cannot use E)
- GAUDY (G-A-U-D-Y; U, D, Y are new; but avoid E? yes, and no C,R,N,E)

But we also know that the letter A is fixed in the second position.

We must avoid using C, R, N, E.

Let me list some words with A in the second position: PASTY, MAFIA, SAUNA, SAUCE (but C is banned), HAULM, etc.

Another good one: ""PASTA"" - but it has A twice? P-A-S-T-A. 
But we haven't tested P, S, T.

Alternatively, ""SALTY"": S-A-L-T-Y. This uses S, L, T, Y, all new. And avoids forbidden letters.

Another: ""HAPPY"" - H-A-P-P-Y, but has P twice? We want to test new letters so duplicates might reduce information.

So, ""SALTY"" seems good: S, A, L, T, Y. None of these are in the absent letters (C,R,N,E) and all are different.

But wait, we know that the word has an A in the second position, so SALTY: 
- S: first letter? We don't know if it's present or not.
- A: second position correct.
- L: third? 
- T: fourth?
- Y: fifth?

This will help us test S, L, T, Y.

Another candidate: ""TASTY"" - but T and A are repeated? T-A-S-T-Y: it has two T's. We want to avoid repeats unless necessary.

We could also try ""TIMID"" but I is in third position? Wait: T-I-M-I-D -> no, second letter must be A: so T-A-M-E-S? But E is banned.

Perhaps ""VALID"": V-A-L-I-D -> L and I are tested? But we don't know if vowels I might be present.

But note: we don't know if V, L, I, D are in the word or not.

But let's choose one that covers common letters.

Since we have limited information, we can start with SALTY, but note that it uses S and T, which are common.

Alternatively, ""DAISY"" -> D-A-I-S-Y: but D is new, I is new, S and Y? But note D-A-I-S-Y: second letter A. We know E is banned, so DAISY doesn't contain E? Actually, DAISY has no E, but we have D, I, S, Y. 

But we got E absent, so DAISY is okay? Wait, DAISY: D, A, I, S, Y.

But we also have a constraint: the first letter cannot be D? No, we don't know that. But we know D is not yet tested.

But we have an option.

Let me compare:

SALTY: letters S, A (fixed), L, T, Y
DAISY: D, A (fixed), I, S, Y

Which letters are more common? Both S and T are very common, so SALTY might be more informative? But S appears in both.

Alternatively, ""BASIC"" but C is banned -> can't use.

""JAZZY"" has Z repeated and isn't common.

""GAUDY"" we considered.

Another: ""PAINT"": P-A-I-N-T -> but N is banned (since first guess had N absent). So PAINT has N -> not allowed? We know N is absent? Yes, so cannot use N.

Similarly, ""FACET"" has F, A, C, E, T -> C and E are banned -> invalid.

So, avoiding N, E, C, R.

""VALID"": V-A-L-I-D -> acceptable? V, A, L, I, D. None are banned. 

""VALID"" might be a good choice? It tests V, L, I, D.

But we also want to test letters that are more common? L, I are common; V is less common; D is common too.

Alternatively, ""SALAD"": but two A's? S-A-L-A-D -> we test S, L, D? And A twice. But since A is already known, we might get information about whether another A exists? But that might complicate the feedback.

I think it's better to avoid duplicates for now to get maximum information per letter.

Therefore, words with 5 distinct letters avoiding C,R,N,E:

- SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y
- DAISY: D, A, I, S, Y
- VALID: V, A, L, I, D
- MAJOR: M,A,J,O,R -> R is banned? No, first guess had R absent, so R is not in the word -> banned. So MAJOR has R -> cannot use.

Similarly, words with R are banned.

So available words:

- SALTY: no banned letters? S, A, L, T, Y. S is not banned? Banned are C, R, N, E. S is not in banned list. Similarly L, T, Y are okay.

Another: ""BALMY"": B,A,L,M,Y -> checks B, L, M, Y.

But SALTY has T? Maybe T is more common than M.

After eliminating: I think SALTY is a good choice.

But let's check ""TIPSY"": T-I-P-S-Y -> second letter I? We need A in second position. So T-A-P-S-Y? But TAPYS isn't a word.

Another: ""HASTY"": H,A,S,T,Y -> same as SALTY? HASTY: H, A, S, T, Y. We test H, S, T, Y.

HASTY vs SALTY: SALTY has L, which HASTY doesn't. HASTY has H and S, T, Y.

Both seem good.

I choose SALTY because I prefer the letter L over H? How? Actually, both are valid.

But note: the first guess eliminated C,R,N,E. So we have more letters available.

We might also consider the frequency: In 5-letter words, letters near the beginning might be important? Or just overall.

Common letters: A is already known. Other common consonants: T, S, L, D, etc.

So SALTY covers S, L, T, Y.

Or DAISY covers D, I, S, Y.

I think SALTY is reasonable.

Alternatively, ""PALSY"": P,A,L,S,Y -> similar to SALTY but with P instead of T? T is more frequent than P? Actually, T is more common.

Therefore, SALTY: S in first position, A in second (fixed), L in third, T in fourth, Y in fifth.

This will tell us if S, L, T, Y are in the word and where.

So let's go with SALTY.

But wait: the word SALTY: if we test it, and for example, if the secret word has A in second, and if it has S, L, T, Y? But we don't know.

But that's the point.

Since A is fixed, we can also consider words that don't have A in the middle? No, because A is in the second position, we must reuse that known position to get more feedback.

So yes.

Thus, my second guess is ""SALTY"".

Wait, but SALTY has two positions for A? Actually, SALTY: 
Position 1: S
Position 2: A (fixed, so we know this is correct)
Position 3: L
Position 4: T
Position 5: Y

So no duplicate A? SALTY has only one A? Yes: S, A, L, T, Y -> one A.

I think I confused with SALAD.

So SALTY is fine.

Alternatively, we could try a word that might be the actual word? But we don't have enough info.

Guess: SALTY

But let me confirm: 
- Avoids C,R,N,E: Yes.
- Uses new common letters: S, L, T, Y.
- A in the correct position.

So, I think this is a good second guess.

Therefore, we'll go with SALTY.After the first guess ""CRANE"" with feedback indicating that only the letter 'A' is correct and in the second position, and letters 'C', 'R', 'N', 'E' are not in the word:
- The secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ _
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E (these cannot appear anywhere in the word).
- The next guess should focus on testing new common consonants and vowels (avoiding eliminated letters) while keeping 'A' in the second position to maximize information.

For the second guess:
- Chose ""SALTY"" because:
  - It has 'A' fixed in the second position (required by feedback).
  - It uses new common letters: S, L, T, Y (all distinct and untested).
  - It avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).
- Testing S, L, T, Y will provide insight into their presence and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).

So we know:
- Second letter is A. So the word is _ A _ _ _
- Letters C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SALTY -> S(✓), A(-), L(x), T(-), Y(x)
Meaning:
- S is in the correct position (position 1). So the first letter is S.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position. But wait, from the first guess, we know A is in position 2. Now, in SALTY, A is in position 2 again, but the feedback says ""-"" which means wrong position? That contradicts!

But note: the feedback says A(-) which means the letter A is present but not in this position. However, we know that A must be in position 2 because of the first feedback. So this suggests that the secret word has at least two A's? Because A is in position 2 (as per first guess) but in this second guess, when we placed A in position 2 again, it says it is present but wrong position? That implies that for this particular occurrence (the one in position 2 in SALTY) it's not correct, but since we know it was correct in the first guess, the only explanation is that there is another A in a different position? But let me analyze carefully.

Actually, the feedback per letter is for that specific instance. In the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was marked correct (✓). Now, in the second guess, we have A again in position 2, but now marked as ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in this position? This is inconsistent because if the second letter is A (fixed from first guess), then every time we place A in position 2, it should be ✓. Unless... the rules must account for multiple occurrences.

Clarification from rules: when a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky. But in this case:

- The secret word must have A in position 2, so if we place A in position 2, it should get ✓ unless the secret word does not have A in that position? But we know it does from first guess.

Therefore, the feedback for A in SALTY must be ✓? But the feedback says A(-). This is a contradiction.

Unless... I misread the feedback. The feedback for SALTY is:

S(✓) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)

And for the first guess, A was in position 2 and marked ✓.

The only logical explanation is that the secret word has only one A, but it has been moved? But that can't be, because we fixed it in position 2. Alternatively, there was an error in the feedback? But I think we must trust the feedback.

Another possibility: the secret word has two A's. In the first guess (CRANE), the A in position 2 matched one of them. In the second guess (SALTY), the A in position 2 does not match because the second A is different? No, the same letter A.

But actually, the feedback is given per position. For SALTY:

- S in position 1: is in the correct position? Given ✓, so the first letter must be S? Then the word is S A _ _ _ but wait, we already thought second letter A.

But now, the second letter A was marked ""-"", meaning it's not in the right position? Even though it was confirmed to be in the right position before?

Therefore, the secret word must have at least two A's.

Explanation with an example: suppose the secret word is something like ""SAUCE"", but we know C and E are absent? So not possible.

Let's assume the secret word has two A's. Then:

First guess CRANE: A in position 2 -> the secret word has A in position 2? But if there is only one A, then it must be in position 2. If there are two A's, then the first feedback for A: position 2 matches, so ✓.

Second guess SALTY: A in position 2. If the secret word has another A, then this A could be matching a different occurrence? But wait, the second occurrence might be in a different position. However, when we place A in position 2, if the secret word has A in position 2, then that specific occurrence should get ✓. But if the secret word does not have an A in position 2? But it must because of the first guess.

Unless the feedback for duplicate letters works as follows: if a guess has duplicate letters, the feedback might be assigned to different occurrences. But SALTY has only one A.

So SALTY: we placed an A in position 2. Since the secret word has A in position 2 (from first feedback), this should be ✓, but in the feedback it's marked ""-"".

This is impossible.

Therefore, there is an error in my reasoning or the feedback.

Alternate interpretation: Perhaps the first guess feedback was not binding the second letter forever? But no, unless the word changes? It doesn't.

So the only remaining possibility is that the secret word has at least two A's. And in the first guess, when we placed A in position 2, it matched one occurrence. In the second guess, when we placed A in position 2, it matches the same occurrence? So it should still be ✓. But the feedback says ""-"", meaning not in position 2? Contradiction.

Perhaps the rules: if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will show for each occurrence. But SALTY has only one A. For the feedback to show A(-), it means that A is in the secret word but not in position 2? But it must be in position 2.

So I'm stuck.

Another idea: maybe the feedback for SALTY is telling us that the first letter is S, but the second letter is not A? But from the first guess, we know the second letter is A.

Let me parse the feedback literally.

Guess 2: SALTY
- Letter 1: S (position 1) -> ✓
- Letter 2: A (position 2) -> -  (present but wrong position)
- Letter 3: L (position 3) -> x
- Letter 4: T (position 4) -> - 
- Letter 5: Y (position 5) -> x

But feedback for A says it's in the word but not in this position. Even though we know from guess 1 that position 2 is A? So how can position 2 not be A? Only if the secret word has changed or something? No.

The only resolution is that there are two A's in the secret word, and in this guess, the A at position 2 is not the one that was previously at position 2, but wait, same letter.

Perhaps the secret word is ""SAHAB"" or something? But letters must be standard.

Moreover, we know that in the first guess, A at position 2 was correct, so the secret word has A at position 2. In SALTY, A at position 2 is exactly that same letter, so it should be correct.

But the feedback contradicts.

Unless the feedback is relative to this guess only, and the earlier feedback is not to be used? No, previous feedback is to be used.

So I think there must be an error in my assumption about duplicate letters.

Let's look for official Wordle rules on duplicate letters.

In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times in the guess, and thesecret word has fewer, it might be marked for the first occurrence only, but if the secret word has multiple, then it can match.

But here, our guess doesn't have duplicate letters. SALTY has no duplicate letters.

So no issue.

Perhaps the feedback for A in SALTY is for the specific instance. And since the secret word has only one A, and we placed it in position 2, but the secret word's A is at position 2, so it should be marked . Why ""-""?

This is a puzzle. Perhaps the word ""CRANE"" had an A which was at position 2 and correct, but that doesn't mean there is only one A. Maybe the secret word has A in position 2 and another A elsewhere.

In SALTY, we have A in position 2. The secret word has A in position 2 and also in another position. But the feedback for position 2: since we placed A there and there is an A there, it should be ✓. Unless they mark it only for the first occurrence?

But rules say: ""the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position"" for ""-"". For a correct position, it should be ✓.

Perhaps the secret word does not have an A in position 2? But guess 1 said A is correct and in position 2.

So let's assume the feedback for guess 2 takes precedence or there's a mistake.

But I think I must accept the feedback as given. So according to guess 2: S(✓) and A(-) means the first letter is S, and A is in the word but not at position 2. But this conflicts with guess 1 where A at position 2 was correct.

The only way to resolve is that the secret word has at least two A's. In guess 1, when we had A in position 2, it matched the secret word's A in position 2. In guess 2, when we have A in position 2, but now the secret word's A in position 2 has already been ""used"" or something? But that doesn't make sense.

In some Wordle implementations, if there are duplicate letters, and you guess a letter in a position where it is correct, it counts. But in this case, since we are using the same position, it should be correct.

I think I need to proceed with the given feedback.

So from guess 2 feedback:

- S is in the correct position (1), so first letter is S.
- A is in the word but not in position 2. (This is new information that contradicts previous knowledge? Or we have to integrate it.)
- L is not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- Y is not in the word.

But guess 1 said position 2 is A. Now according to this, position 2 is not A? How can both be true?

Unless the secret word is such that: from guess 1, the second letter is A, so the word is _ A _ _ _ . But from guess 2, we have S at position 1 which is ✓, so the word is S A _ _ _ . Then we have A at position 2, and feedback says it's not in that position? But that position 2 is A.

 The feedback for A in guess 2 says ""-"", which by the rules means ""the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position"". So it must be that the secret word has an A, but not in position 2.

 But we know from guess 1 that there is an A in position 2.

 Therefore, the secret word has at least two A's. And in guess 2, when we placed A at position 2, they are using that to indicate one of the other A's? But the rules are not clear on this.

 Standard Wordle behavior: if the guess has a letter that is in the word at a different position, it gets ""-"", and if in the correct position, it gets ""✓"". For duplicate letters, it's matched in order.

 However, in this case, the secret word has A at position 2, but for some reason, in guess 2, it's marked as ""-"" for position 2? That should not happen.

 Given the confusion, we must trust the feedback: so for guess 2, A at position 2 is not correct, meaning the secret word does not have A at position 2. But guess 1 said it does.

 This is logically impossible.

 Alternatively, I misread the feedback.

 The feedback for guess 2 is: S(✓) for letter 1, A(-) for letter 2, etc.

 And for guess 1, the feedback was A(✓) for letter 3? No: CRANE has positions:
 C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5)

 Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)

 So for guess 1:
- Position 3: A is correct.

 So the secret word has A in position 3, not position 2. In a 5-letter word, positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

 I think I made a mistake: in CRANE, the sequence is:
 1: C
 2: R
 3: A
 4: N
 5: E

 Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)

 Therefore, the third letter is A, so the word is _ _ A _ _

 Then, for guess 2: SALTY
 1: S
 2: A
 3: L
 4: T
 5: Y
 Feedback: S(✓) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)

 Now, S(✓) at position 1: so first letter is S.
 A(-) at position 2: A is in the word but not in position 2.
 And L not in word, T in word but not position 4, Y not in word.

 Also, from guess 1, we know the third letter is A.

 So putting together:
- First letter: S (from guess 2)
- Third letter: A (from guess 1)
- Second letter is not A (from guess 2), but we already knew it wasn't from guess 1 R(x) and now A(-) confirms that the letter there is not A, and A is not in second position.

 So the word is S ? A _ _

 Also, we know that C, R, N, E are absent (from guess 1).

 From guess 2: L and Y are absent.
 T is present but not in position 4.

 So the word is: S _ A _ _

 Letters present in word: S (first), A (third), T (somewhere not position 4), and possibly others.

 Letters absent: C, R, N, E, L, Y.

 From positions: position 4 might not be T, and position 5 is not yet known.

 Also, since T is present and not in position 4, it must be in position 2 or 5? But position 3 is A, and position 1 is S, so T must be in position 2 or 5.

 But position 4 could be something else, but T is not there.

 Also, we need to include the two new pieces of information: T must be in the word (since it's marked ""-""), and we now know A is not in position 2 (which we already knew).

Possible letters: after two guesses, eliminated: C,R,N,E,L,Y.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

And we must include T.

For the next guess, we want to test:
- Position 2: it's not T? Could be.
- Position 4: not T.
- Position 5: unknown.

Also, to cover more common letters.

A good guess should have:
- S at position 1 (already fixed)
- ? at position 2
- A at position 3 (already fixed)
- ? at position 4
- ? at position 5

And test position 2 and 5, and also check for T's position? And 4.

Since we know T is in the word, and not in position 4, we should try to place T in position 2 or 5 in our guess to see if it fits.

Alternatively, we can test multiple letters.

But we already have S and A fixed.

So let's construct a word: S ? A ? ?

With ? not in eliminated letters: C,R,N,E,L,Y eliminated.

And T must appear somewhere.

Possible words:

- STAFF? But F repeated, not efficient. Anyway, letters: S-T-A-F-F. F is new. But position 2 is T, position 4 is F, position 5 is F.

But we don't know if F is in word or not.

Or ""STAND"" but N is eliminated.

""STAMP"": S-T-A-M-P -> tests T in pos 2, M in 4, P in 5. M and P are new.

Other options: ""STAKE"" -> but E is eliminated, cannot use E.

""STAID"": S-T-A-I-D -> I and D new.

""STAIR"" but R is eliminated.

""SOAPY"" but Y is eliminated? Y is eliminated according to guess 2.

""SHADY"" -- H and D, but Y eliminated? Y is absent.

So avoid Y.

""SCABY"" -- C eliminated.

Possible good words: ""SAD"", but that's 3 letters. ""SABER"" -- B and E, but E is eliminated.

""SAT"" is 3 letters.

""STACK"" -- C and K? C eliminated.

Let's think: ""STADIA"" too long.

 common words: ""STAFF"", but we try to avoid duplicates.

""STACK"" not allowed (C).

""STAKE"" not allowed (E).

""STAGE"": S-T-A-G-E -> E eliminated.

""STAID"": S-T-A-I-D -> letters T, I, D. Allowed? T is in pos 2? But T is present and not at 4; if it is at 2, then at pos 2 it should be marked correct if we guess.

But in guess 2, T was at pos 4 and marked ""-"", so in another position.

We are going to place T at pos 2 now to test.

Similarly, ""STAIN"" has N.

"" STAUD "" not a word.

"" STAW "" not 5 letters.

""STAPH"": S-T-A-P-H -> H is new.

Or ""STAPHY"" too long.

5-letter words: ""STAPS""? Not common.

""STAIR"" -> R eliminated.

Another word: ""SWAMI"": S-W-A-M-I -> W, M, I new, but position 3 is A? This word is S-W-A-M-I, so second letter W, third letter A, fourth M, fifth I. So W at pos 2.

But in this case, T is in the word but not placed anywhere? We need to include T to see if it fits position 5 or so.

But if we don't include T, then we won't know if T is in position 5 or not.

In the secret word, T is present, but in a position other than 4. Possible positions: 2 or 5.

We can try a word that has T in position 5 or 2.

But we also want to test other letters for position 2 and 5.

Since position 3 is fixed A, position 1 fixed S, we can focus on the remaining letters.

The unknown positions are 2,4,5.

T is in one of 2,5? Or could it be in 4? Feedback said T not in position 4, so 2 or 5.

So let's make a guess that places T in position 2 to test.

If the secret word has T in position 2, then we get a ✓ for it. If not, thenT must be in 5.

So one strategy is to test T at position 2.

Also include common vowels like O or I.

For example: ""STACK"" no because C eliminated.

""STADE"" E eliminated.

""STAFF"": S,T,A,F,F -- but F repeated.

""STAFF"" is a valid word, but two F's. If the secret word has only one F, then it will be marked accordingly.

We could try ""SAPID"": S-A-P-I-D -> positions: S1, A2, P3, I4, D5. This doesn't have A in position 3? Position 3 would be P, but we need A in position 3? No, the secret word has A in position 3.

In ""SAPID"": 
1. S -> fixed correct
2. A -> not fixed? The secret word has A in position 3, so position 2 should not be A? Actually.
In ""SAPID"", letter at position 3 is P, but we know position 3 must be A? So we cannot try SAPID because position 3 is P, not A.

We must have position 3 as A in every guess? Because it is correct.

Yes, the strategy is to keep fixed to get information on remaining positions.

So for position 3: A must be present; for now we know it's fixed at position 3.

So in the word, position 3 is A.

So for our guess, it should be: S ? A ? ?

? being letters not C,R,N,E,L,Y.

And T must appear in the word? Yes, present somewhere.

And T is not in position 4, so T must be in position 2 or position 5.

So let's place T in one of these.

Option 1: Place T in position 2 -> word: ""S T A _ _""

But what for 4 and 5? Must choose available letters.

For example: ""ST A F F"" -> STAFF

Or ""ST A M P"" -> STAMP

Or ""ST A L K"" but L eliminated and K? L is eliminated? From guess 2 L(x) so L not in word.

Also Y eliminated.

So ""STAMP"" : S, T, A, M, P

Checks M and P, new letters.

""STAFF"": S, T, A, F, F

But F repeated.

I think ""STAMP"" is better.

Option 2: Place T in position 5: then word: ""S ? A ? T""

? must not be T? But position 2 could be something else.

For example: ""S H A M T"" -> not common word we know.

Or ""S I A M T"" - not a word.

Better is: ""S W A M T"" -> not common.

""S H A P T"" -> SHAPT not a word.

""S K A T E"" -> E eliminated.

To place T in position 5, we have: ""S _ A _ T""

With position 2 and 4 to fill: but must be a word.

Possible: ""SPLAT"" but L eliminated and P? L eliminated.

""SCRAT"" C eliminated and R elim.

""S K I A T"" -> not positions.

Common words: ""S C A T S"" -> C elim.

"" S W A T T "" -> has two T's.

But T in pos 5.

""SWART"" -> R eliminated.

 I think it's hard with T at the end.

So go back to placing T in position 2.

So ""STAMP"" seems a good candidate: S(1), T(2), A(3), M(4), P(5)

But in guess 2, we had T at position 4 marked ""-"", so T is in the word but not at position 4. If we place T at position 2 and it is correct, then we're lucky. If not, then T must be at position 5.

In this guess, we can test position 2 with T, and also test M and P for positions 4 and 5.

If the secret word is ""STAMP"", then we win.

Otherwise, we get more feedback.

Another possibility: ""STAID"" with T at 2: positions 2=T, 4=I, 5=D.

But STAID: S-T-A-I-D.

Test I and D.

Both seem good.

Or ""STA N D"" -> N eliminated.

So STAID is a possibility.

I think STAID and STAMP are both good.

But consider: ""STAID"" uses I and D, and ""STAMP"" uses M and P. Which has more common letters? I and D are common, M and P also.

Other options: ""STA G E"" -> E elim.

""STALK"" L elim.

So let's go with ""STAID"" for more vowels.

But STAID: S-T-A-I-D.

Position 3 is A, fixed.

Note that position 4 is I, a vowel, position 5 D.

Also, T at position 2.

So we can try this.

Or to not place T prematurely, we could choose a word that doesn't have T but tests position 2 and 5 differently? But T must be in a position we haven't tested, either 2 or 5.

If we don't include T, then the feedback won't tell us where T is? But if we include T, we can tell.

But perhaps use a word with T in position 5.

For example: ""S O A P T""  - not a word? 
""SPOAT"" not a word.

""S K A L T"" L elim.

Another word: ""SOUTH"" not.

""S H A F T"" - SHAFT is a word? S, H, A, F, T. But position 2 is H, position 4 is F, position 5 is T. And position 3 is A fixed. So SHAFT.

This tests H at position 2, F at position 4, T at position 5.

Since T is present, And not at 4, so at position 5 it should be correct if appropriate.

We can use SHAFT.

But is SHAFT common? It is a English word.

In SHAFT:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: F
- Position 5: T

We will get feedback on H, F, T.

Since we know T is present, if at position 5 we put T, it might be correct or not.

Similarly, F and H are new.

Let's decide between STAID, STAMP, or SHAFT.

Another word: ""SHAPT"" not a word.

I think STAID is widely accepted as a word meaning sedate, respectable.

Similarly, STAMP is common.

SHAFT is also common.

But in terms of information: STAID places T at position 2. SHAFT places T at position 5.

Since we want to find out where T is, either way is useful.

But let me choose STAMP for its commonality.

So to guess: STAMP

<guess>STAMP</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: Letters C, R, N, E are absent from the word (x). Letter A is present and in the correct position (✓), revealing that the 3rd letter is A. Therefore, the secret word has the form _ _ A _ _.
- **Guess 2 (SALTY)**: 
  - S is present and in the correct position (✓), revealing that the 1st letter is S.
  - A is present but in the wrong position (-). However, since we know A must be in position 3, this implies the secret word has at least two A's, and one of them is in position 3.
  - L and Y are absent (x).
  - T is present (-) but not in position 4.

Constraints identified:
- **Known Positions**: 1st letter is S, 3rd letter is A → Secret word format: S _ A _ _.
- **Present Letters (must be included)**: A (due to multiple occurrences), T (and T cannot be in position 4).
- **Absent Letters (cannot be included)**: C, R, N, E, L, Y.
- **Possible Positions for T**: Must be in position 2 or 5 (only remaining positions, since it can't be in 4).
- **Other Positions**: Test position 2 and 5, and determine the letter at position 4.

For the next guess:
- **Strategy**: Place T in position 2 to test if it belongs there, as it is a high-frequency letter and must appear. This helps narrow down the letter at position 5. Use common English letters not yet tested or eliminated (avoiding C, R, N, E, L, Y).
- **Chosen Word: STAMP**
  - S (1st position): Confirmed correct (from previous feedback).
  - T (2nd position): Tests if T is in position 2.
  - A (3rd position): Confirmed correct.
  - M (4th position): Tests a new common consonant.
  - P (5th position): Tests a new common consonant.
- **Advantages**: 
  - Efficiently tests T in position 2 while covering new letters (M and P).
  - If T is not in position 2, the feedback will confirm it must be in position 5.

Using a word with mostly new letters would be better.\n\nOther words with A in second position: \n- TABLE (but E is in the word, and we know E is absent -> so cannot use E)\n- GAUDY (G-A-U-D-Y; U, D, Y are new; but avoid E? yes, and no C,R,N,E)\n\nBut we also know that the letter A is fixed in the second position.\n\nWe must avoid using C, R, N, E.\n\nLet me list some words with A in the second position: PASTY, MAFIA, SAUNA, SAUCE (but C is banned), HAULM, etc.\n\nAnother good one: ""PASTA"" - but it has A twice? P-A-S-T-A. \nBut we haven\'t tested P, S, T.\n\nAlternatively, ""SALTY"": S-A-L-T-Y. This uses S, L, T, Y, all new. And avoids forbidden letters.\n\nAnother: ""HAPPY"" - H-A-P-P-Y, but has P twice? We want to test new letters so duplicates might reduce information.\n\nSo, ""SALTY"" seems good: S, A, L, T, Y. None of these are in the absent letters (C,R,N,E) and all are different.\n\nBut wait, we know that the word has an A in the second position, so SALTY: \n- S: first letter? We don\'t know if it\'s present or not.\n- A: second position correct.\n- L: third? \n- T: fourth?\n- Y: fifth?\n\nThis will help us test S, L, T, Y.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TASTY"" - but T and A are repeated? T-A-S-T-Y: it has two T\'s. We want to avoid repeats unless necessary.\n\nWe could also try ""TIMID"" but I is in third position? Wait: T-I-M-I-D -> no, second letter must be A: so T-A-M-E-S? But E is banned.\n\nPerhaps ""VALID"": V-A-L-I-D -> L and I are tested? But we don\'t know if vowels I might be present.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if V, L, I, D are in the word or not.\n\nBut let\'s choose one that covers common letters.\n\nSince we have limited information, we can start with SALTY, but note that it uses S and T, which are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""DAISY"" -> D-A-I-S-Y: but D is new, I is new, S and Y? But note D-A-I-S-Y: second letter A. We know E is banned, so DAISY doesn\'t contain E? Actually, DAISY has no E, but we have D, I, S, Y. \n\nBut we got E absent, so DAISY is okay? Wait, DAISY: D, A, I, S, Y.\n\nBut we also have a constraint: the first letter cannot be D? No, we don\'t know that. But we know D is not yet tested.\n\nBut we have an option.\n\nLet me compare:\n\nSALTY: letters S, A (fixed), L, T, Y\nDAISY: D, A (fixed), I, S, Y\n\nWhich letters are more common? Both S and T are very common, so SALTY might be more informative? But S appears in both.\n\nAlternatively, ""BASIC"" but C is banned -> can\'t use.\n\n""JAZZY"" has Z repeated and isn\'t common.\n\n""GAUDY"" we considered.\n\nAnother: ""PAINT"": P-A-I-N-T -> but N is banned (since first guess had N absent). So PAINT has N -> not allowed? We know N is absent? Yes, so cannot use N.\n\nSimilarly, ""FACET"" has F, A, C, E, T -> C and E are banned -> invalid.\n\nSo, avoiding N, E, C, R.\n\n""VALID"": V-A-L-I-D -> acceptable? V, A, L, I, D. None are banned. \n\n""VALID"" might be a good choice? It tests V, L, I, D.\n\nBut we also want to test letters that are more common? L, I are common; V is less common; D is common too.\n\nAlternatively, ""SALAD"": but two A\'s? S-A-L-A-D -> we test S, L, D? And A twice. But since A is already known, we might get information about whether another A exists? But that might complicate the feedback.\n\nI think it\'s better to avoid duplicates for now to get maximum information per letter.\n\nTherefore, words with 5 distinct letters avoiding C,R,N,E:\n\n- SALTY: S, A, L, T, Y\n- DAISY: D, A, I, S, Y\n- VALID: V, A, L, I, D\n- MAJOR: M,A,J,O,R -> R is banned? No, first guess had R absent, so R is not in the word -> banned. So MAJOR has R -> cannot use.\n\nSimilarly, words with R are banned.\n\nSo available words:\n\n- SALTY: no banned letters? S, A, L, T, Y. S is not banned? Banned are C, R, N, E. S is not in banned list. Similarly L, T, Y are okay.\n\nAnother: ""BALMY"": B,A,L,M,Y -> checks B, L, M, Y.\n\nBut SALTY has T? Maybe T is more common than M.\n\nAfter eliminating: I think SALTY is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s check ""TIPSY"": T-I-P-S-Y -> second letter I? We need A in second position. So T-A-P-S-Y? But TAPYS isn\'t a word.\n\nAnother: ""HASTY"": H,A,S,T,Y -> same as SALTY? HASTY: H, A, S, T, Y. We test H, S, T, Y.\n\nHASTY vs SALTY: SALTY has L, which HASTY doesn\'t. HASTY has H and S, T, Y.\n\nBoth seem good.\n\nI choose SALTY because I prefer the letter L over H? How? Actually, both are valid.\n\nBut note: the first guess eliminated C,R,N,E. So we have more letters available.\n\nWe might also consider the frequency: In 5-letter words, letters near the beginning might be important? Or just overall.\n\nCommon letters: A is already known. Other common consonants: T, S, L, D, etc.\n\nSo SALTY covers S, L, T, Y.\n\nOr DAISY covers D, I, S, Y.\n\nI think SALTY is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, ""PALSY"": P,A,L,S,Y -> similar to SALTY but with P instead of T? T is more frequent than P? Actually, T is more common.\n\nTherefore, SALTY: S in first position, A in second (fixed), L in third, T in fourth, Y in fifth.\n\nThis will tell us if S, L, T, Y are in the word and where.\n\nSo let\'s go with SALTY.\n\nBut wait: the word SALTY: if we test it, and for example, if the secret word has A in second, and if it has S, L, T, Y? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut that\'s the point.\n\nSince A is fixed, we can also consider words that don\'t have A in the middle? No, because A is in the second position, we must reuse that known position to get more feedback.\n\nSo yes.\n\nThus, my second guess is ""SALTY"".\n\nWait, but SALTY has two positions for A? Actually, SALTY: \nPosition 1: S\nPosition 2: A (fixed, so we know this is correct)\nPosition 3: L\nPosition 4: T\nPosition 5: Y\n\nSo no duplicate A? SALTY has only one A? Yes: S, A, L, T, Y -> one A.\n\nI think I confused with SALAD.\n\nSo SALTY is fine.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that might be the actual word? But we don\'t have enough info.\n\nGuess: SALTY\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- Avoids C,R,N,E: Yes.\n- Uses new common letters: S, L, T, Y.\n- A in the correct position.\n\nSo, I think this is a good second guess.\n\nTherefore, we\'ll go with SALTY.After the first guess ""CRANE"" with feedback indicating that only the letter \'A\' is correct and in the second position, and letters \'C\', \'R\', \'N\', \'E\' are not in the word:\n- The secret word is of the form: _ A _ _ _\n- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E (these cannot appear anywhere in the word).\n- The next guess should focus on testing new common consonants and vowels (avoiding eliminated letters) while keeping \'A\' in the second position to maximize information.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Chose ""SALTY"" because:\n  - It has \'A\' fixed in the second position (required by feedback).\n  - It uses new common letters: S, L, T, Y (all distinct and untested).\n  - It avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).\n- Testing S, L, T, Y will provide insight into their presence and positions.\n\n<guess>SALTY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.\n\nSo we know:\n- Second letter is A. So the word is _ A _ _ _\n- Letters C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: SALTY -> S(✓), A(-), L(x), T(-), Y(x)\nMeaning:\n- S is in the correct position (position 1). So the first letter is S.\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position. But wait, from the first guess, we know A is in position 2. Now, in SALTY, A is in position 2 again, but the feedback says ""-"" which means wrong position? That contradicts!\n\nBut note: the feedback says A(-) which means the letter A is present but not in this position. However, we know that A must be in position 2 because of the first feedback. So this suggests that the secret word has at least two A\'s? Because A is in position 2 (as per first guess) but in this second guess, when we placed A in position 2 again, it says it is present but wrong position? That implies that for this particular occurrence (the one in position 2 in SALTY) it\'s not correct, but since we know it was correct in the first guess, the only explanation is that there is another A in a different position? But let me analyze carefully.\n\nActually, the feedback per letter is for that specific instance. In the first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was marked correct (✓). Now, in the second guess, we have A again in position 2, but now marked as ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but not in this position? This is inconsistent because if the second letter is A (fixed from first guess), then every time we place A in position 2, it should be ✓. Unless... the rules must account for multiple occurrences.\n\nClarification from rules: when a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky. But in this case:\n\n- The secret word must have A in position 2, so if we place A in position 2, it should get ✓ unless the secret word does not have A in that position? But we know it does from first guess.\n\nTherefore, the feedback for A in SALTY must be ✓? But the feedback says A(-). This is a contradiction.\n\nUnless... I misread the feedback. The feedback for SALTY is:\n\nS(✓) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)\n\nAnd for the first guess, A was in position 2 and marked ✓.\n\nThe only logical explanation is that the secret word has only one A, but it has been moved? But that can\'t be, because we fixed it in position 2. Alternatively, there was an error in the feedback? But I think we must trust the feedback.\n\nAnother possibility: the secret word has two A\'s. In the first guess (CRANE), the A in position 2 matched one of them. In the second guess (SALTY), the A in position 2 does not match because the second A is different? No, the same letter A.\n\nBut actually, the feedback is given per position. For SALTY:\n\n- S in position 1: is in the correct position? Given ✓, so the first letter must be S? Then the word is S A _ _ _ but wait, we already thought second letter A.\n\nBut now, the second letter A was marked ""-"", meaning it\'s not in the right position? Even though it was confirmed to be in the right position before?\n\nTherefore, the secret word must have at least two A\'s.\n\nExplanation with an example: suppose the secret word is something like ""SAUCE"", but we know C and E are absent? So not possible.\n\nLet\'s assume the secret word has two A\'s. Then:\n\nFirst guess CRANE: A in position 2 -> the secret word has A in position 2? But if there is only one A, then it must be in position 2. If there are two A\'s, then the first feedback for A: position 2 matches, so ✓.\n\nSecond guess SALTY: A in position 2. If the secret word has another A, then this A could be matching a different occurrence? But wait, the second occurrence might be in a different position. However, when we place A in position 2, if the secret word has A in position 2, then that specific occurrence should get ✓. But if the secret word does not have an A in position 2? But it must because of the first guess.\n\nUnless the feedback for duplicate letters works as follows: if a guess has duplicate letters, the feedback might be assigned to different occurrences. But SALTY has only one A.\n\nSo SALTY: we placed an A in position 2. Since the secret word has A in position 2 (from first feedback), this should be ✓, but in the feedback it\'s marked ""-"".\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nTherefore, there is an error in my reasoning or the feedback.\n\nAlternate interpretation: Perhaps the first guess feedback was not binding the second letter forever? But no, unless the word changes? It doesn\'t.\n\nSo the only remaining possibility is that the secret word has at least two A\'s. And in the first guess, when we placed A in position 2, it matched one occurrence. In the second guess, when we placed A in position 2, it matches the same occurrence? So it should still be ✓. But the feedback says ""-"", meaning not in position 2? Contradiction.\n\nPerhaps the rules: if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will show for each occurrence. But SALTY has only one A. For the feedback to show A(-), it means that A is in the secret word but not in position 2? But it must be in position 2.\n\nSo I\'m stuck.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the feedback for SALTY is telling us that the first letter is S, but the second letter is not A? But from the first guess, we know the second letter is A.\n\nLet me parse the feedback literally.\n\nGuess 2: SALTY\n- Letter 1: S (position 1) -> ✓\n- Letter 2: A (position 2) -> -  (present but wrong position)\n- Letter 3: L (position 3) -> x\n- Letter 4: T (position 4) -> - \n- Letter 5: Y (position 5) -> x\n\nBut feedback for A says it\'s in the word but not in this position. Even though we know from guess 1 that position 2 is A? So how can position 2 not be A? Only if the secret word has changed or something? No.\n\nThe only resolution is that there are two A\'s in the secret word, and in this guess, the A at position 2 is not the one that was previously at position 2, but wait, same letter.\n\nPerhaps the secret word is ""SAHAB"" or something? But letters must be standard.\n\nMoreover, we know that in the first guess, A at position 2 was correct, so the secret word has A at position 2. In SALTY, A at position 2 is exactly that same letter, so it should be correct.\n\nBut the feedback contradicts.\n\nUnless the feedback is relative to this guess only, and the earlier feedback is not to be used? No, previous feedback is to be used.\n\nSo I think there must be an error in my assumption about duplicate letters.\n\nLet\'s look for official Wordle rules on duplicate letters.\n\nIn Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times in the guess, and thesecret word has fewer, it might be marked for the first occurrence only, but if the secret word has multiple, then it can match.\n\nBut here, our guess doesn\'t have duplicate letters. SALTY has no duplicate letters.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps the feedback for A in SALTY is for the specific instance. And since the secret word has only one A, and we placed it in position 2, but the secret word\'s A is at position 2, so it should be marked . Why ""-""?\n\nThis is a puzzle. Perhaps the word ""CRANE"" had an A which was at position 2 and correct, but that doesn\'t mean there is only one A. Maybe the secret word has A in position 2 and another A elsewhere.\n\nIn SALTY, we have A in position 2. The secret word has A in position 2 and also in another position. But the feedback for position 2: since we placed A there and there is an A there, it should be ✓. Unless they mark it only for the first occurrence?\n\nBut rules say: ""the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position"" for ""-"". For a correct position, it should be ✓.\n\nPerhaps the secret word does not have an A in position 2? But guess 1 said A is correct and in position 2.\n\nSo let\'s assume the feedback for guess 2 takes precedence or there\'s a mistake.\n\nBut I think I must accept the feedback as given. So according to guess 2: S(✓) and A(-) means the first letter is S, and A is in the word but not at position 2. But this conflicts with guess 1 where A at position 2 was correct.\n\nThe only way to resolve is that the secret word has at least two A\'s. In guess 1, when we had A in position 2, it matched the secret word\'s A in position 2. In guess 2, when we have A in position 2, but now the secret word\'s A in position 2 has already been ""used"" or something? But that doesn\'t make sense.\n\nIn some Wordle implementations, if there are duplicate letters, and you guess a letter in a position where it is correct, it counts. But in this case, since we are using the same position, it should be correct.\n\nI think I need to proceed with the given feedback.\n\nSo from guess 2 feedback:\n\n- S is in the correct position (1), so first letter is S.\n- A is in the word but not in position 2. (This is new information that contradicts previous knowledge? Or we have to integrate it.)\n- L is not in the word.\n- T is in the word but not in position 4.\n- Y is not in the word.\n\nBut guess 1 said position 2 is A. Now according to this, position 2 is not A? How can both be true?\n\nUnless the secret word is such that: from guess 1, the second letter is A, so the word is _ A _ _ _ . But from guess 2, we have S at position 1 which is ✓, so the word is S A _ _ _ . Then we have A at position 2, and feedback says it\'s not in that position? But that position 2 is A.\n\n The feedback for A in guess 2 says ""-"", which by the rules means ""the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position"". So it must be that the secret word has an A, but not in position 2.\n\n But we know from guess 1 that there is an A in position 2.\n\n Therefore, the secret word has at least two A\'s. And in guess 2, when we placed A at position 2, they are using that to indicate one of the other A\'s? But the rules are not clear on this.\n\n Standard Wordle behavior: if the guess has a letter that is in the word at a different position, it gets ""-"", and if in the correct position, it gets ""✓"". For duplicate letters, it\'s matched in order.\n\n However, in this case, the secret word has A at position 2, but for some reason, in guess 2, it\'s marked as ""-"" for position 2? That should not happen.\n\n Given the confusion, we must trust the feedback: so for guess 2, A at position 2 is not correct, meaning the secret word does not have A at position 2. But guess 1 said it does.\n\n This is logically impossible.\n\n Alternatively, I misread the feedback.\n\n The feedback for guess 2 is: S(✓) for letter 1, A(-) for letter 2, etc.\n\n And for guess 1, the feedback was A(✓) for letter 3? No: CRANE has positions:\n C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5)\n\n Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\n\n So for guess 1:\n- Position 3: A is correct.\n\n So the secret word has A in position 3, not position 2. In a 5-letter word, positions are 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n I think I made a mistake: in CRANE, the sequence is:\n 1: C\n 2: R\n 3: A\n 4: N\n 5: E\n\n Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)\n\n Therefore, the third letter is A, so the word is _ _ A _ _\n\n Then, for guess 2: SALTY\n 1: S\n 2: A\n 3: L\n 4: T\n 5: Y\n Feedback: S(✓) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)\n\n Now, S(✓) at position 1: so first letter is S.\n A(-) at position 2: A is in the word but not in position 2.\n And L not in word, T in word but not position 4, Y not in word.\n\n Also, from guess 1, we know the third letter is A.\n\n So putting together:\n- First letter: S (from guess 2)\n- Third letter: A (from guess 1)\n- Second letter is not A (from guess 2), but we already knew it wasn\'t from guess 1 R(x) and now A(-) confirms that the letter there is not A, and A is not in second position.\n\n So the word is S ? A _ _\n\n Also, we know that C, R, N, E are absent (from guess 1).\n\n From guess 2: L and Y are absent.\n T is present but not in position 4.\n\n So the word is: S _ A _ _\n\n Letters present in word: S (first), A (third), T (somewhere not position 4), and possibly others.\n\n Letters absent: C, R, N, E, L, Y.\n\n From positions: position 4 might not be T, and position 5 is not yet known.\n\n Also, since T is present and not in position 4, it must be in position 2 or 5? But position 3 is A, and position 1 is S, so T must be in position 2 or 5.\n\n But position 4 could be something else, but T is not there.\n\n Also, we need to include the two new pieces of information: T must be in the word (since it\'s marked ""-""), and we now know A is not in position 2 (which we already knew).\n\nPossible letters: after two guesses, eliminated: C,R,N,E,L,Y.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z\n\nAnd we must include T.\n\nFor the next guess, we want to test:\n- Position 2: it\'s not T? Could be.\n- Position 4: not T.\n- Position 5: unknown.\n\nAlso, to cover more common letters.\n\nA good guess should have:\n- S at position 1 (already fixed)\n- ? at position 2\n- A at position 3 (already fixed)\n- ? at position 4\n- ? at position 5\n\nAnd test position 2 and 5, and also check for T\'s position? And 4.\n\nSince we know T is in the word, and not in position 4, we should try to place T in position 2 or 5 in our guess to see if it fits.\n\nAlternatively, we can test multiple letters.\n\nBut we already have S and A fixed.\n\nSo let\'s construct a word: S ? A ? ?\n\nWith ? not in eliminated letters: C,R,N,E,L,Y eliminated.\n\nAnd T must appear somewhere.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- STAFF? But F repeated, not efficient. Anyway, letters: S-T-A-F-F. F is new. But position 2 is T, position 4 is F, position 5 is F.\n\nBut we don\'t know if F is in word or not.\n\nOr ""STAND"" but N is eliminated.\n\n""STAMP"": S-T-A-M-P -> tests T in pos 2, M in 4, P in 5. M and P are new.\n\nOther options: ""STAKE"" -> but E is eliminated, cannot use E.\n\n""STAID"": S-T-A-I-D -> I and D new.\n\n""STAIR"" but R is eliminated.\n\n""SOAPY"" but Y is eliminated? Y is eliminated according to guess 2.\n\n""SHADY"" -- H and D, but Y eliminated? Y is absent.\n\nSo avoid Y.\n\n""SCABY"" -- C eliminated.\n\nPossible good words: ""SAD"", but that\'s 3 letters. ""SABER"" -- B and E, but E is eliminated.\n\n""SAT"" is 3 letters.\n\n""STACK"" -- C and K? C eliminated.\n\nLet\'s think: ""STADIA"" too long.\n\n common words: ""STAFF"", but we try to avoid duplicates.\n\n""STACK"" not allowed (C).\n\n""STAKE"" not allowed (E).\n\n""STAGE"": S-T-A-G-E -> E eliminated.\n\n""STAID"": S-T-A-I-D -> letters T, I, D. Allowed? T is in pos 2? But T is present and not at 4; if it is at 2, then at pos 2 it should be marked correct if we guess.\n\nBut in guess 2, T was at pos 4 and marked ""-"", so in another position.\n\nWe are going to place T at pos 2 now to test.\n\nSimilarly, ""STAIN"" has N.\n\n"" STAUD "" not a word.\n\n"" STAW "" not 5 letters.\n\n""STAPH"": S-T-A-P-H -> H is new.\n\nOr ""STAPHY"" too long.\n\n5-letter words: ""STAPS""? Not common.\n\n""STAIR"" -> R eliminated.\n\nAnother word: ""SWAMI"": S-W-A-M-I -> W, M, I new, but position 3 is A? This word is S-W-A-M-I, so second letter W, third letter A, fourth M, fifth I. So W at pos 2.\n\nBut in this case, T is in the word but not placed anywhere? We need to include T to see if it fits position 5 or so.\n\nBut if we don\'t include T, then we won\'t know if T is in position 5 or not.\n\nIn the secret word, T is present, but in a position other than 4. Possible positions: 2 or 5.\n\nWe can try a word that has T in position 5 or 2.\n\nBut we also want to test other letters for position 2 and 5.\n\nSince position 3 is fixed A, position 1 fixed S, we can focus on the remaining letters.\n\nThe unknown positions are 2,4,5.\n\nT is in one of 2,5? Or could it be in 4? Feedback said T not in position 4, so 2 or 5.\n\nSo let\'s make a guess that places T in position 2 to test.\n\nIf the secret word has T in position 2, then we get a ✓ for it. If not, thenT must be in 5.\n\nSo one strategy is to test T at position 2.\n\nAlso include common vowels like O or I.\n\nFor example: ""STACK"" no because C eliminated.\n\n""STADE"" E eliminated.\n\n""STAFF"": S,T,A,F,F -- but F repeated.\n\n""STAFF"" is a valid word, but two F\'s. If the secret word has only one F, then it will be marked accordingly.\n\nWe could try ""SAPID"": S-A-P-I-D -> positions: S1, A2, P3, I4, D5. This doesn\'t have A in position 3? Position 3 would be P, but we need A in position 3? No, the secret word has A in position 3.\n\nIn ""SAPID"": \n1. S -> fixed correct\n2. A -> not fixed? The secret word has A in position 3, so position 2 should not be A? Actually.\nIn ""SAPID"", letter at position 3 is P, but we know position 3 must be A? So we cannot try SAPID because position 3 is P, not A.\n\nWe must have position 3 as A in every guess? Because it is correct.\n\nYes, the strategy is to keep fixed to get information on remaining positions.\n\nSo for position 3: A must be present; for now we know it\'s fixed at position 3.\n\nSo in the word, position 3 is A.\n\nSo for our guess, it should be: S ? A ? ?\n\n? being letters not C,R,N,E,L,Y.\n\nAnd T must appear in the word? Yes, present somewhere.\n\nAnd T is not in position 4, so T must be in position 2 or position 5.\n\nSo let\'s place T in one of these.\n\nOption 1: Place T in position 2 -> word: ""S T A _ _""\n\nBut what for 4 and 5? Must choose available letters.\n\nFor example: ""ST A F F"" -> STAFF\n\nOr ""ST A M P"" -> STAMP\n\nOr ""ST A L K"" but L eliminated and K? L is eliminated? From guess 2 L(x) so L not in word.\n\nAlso Y eliminated.\n\nSo ""STAMP"" : S, T, A, M, P\n\nChecks M and P, new letters.\n\n""STAFF"": S, T, A, F, F\n\nBut F repeated.\n\nI think ""STAMP"" is better.\n\nOption 2: Place T in position 5: then word: ""S ? A ? T""\n\n? must not be T? But position 2 could be something else.\n\nFor example: ""S H A M T"" -> not common word we know.\n\nOr ""S I A M T"" - not a word.\n\nBetter is: ""S W A M T"" -> not common.\n\n""S H A P T"" -> SHAPT not a word.\n\n""S K A T E"" -> E eliminated.\n\nTo place T in position 5, we have: ""S _ A _ T""\n\nWith position 2 and 4 to fill: but must be a word.\n\nPossible: ""SPLAT"" but L eliminated and P? L eliminated.\n\n""SCRAT"" C eliminated and R elim.\n\n""S K I A T"" -> not positions.\n\nCommon words: ""S C A T S"" -> C elim.\n\n"" S W A T T "" -> has two T\'s.\n\nBut T in pos 5.\n\n""SWART"" -> R eliminated.\n\n I think it\'s hard with T at the end.\n\nSo go back to placing T in position 2.\n\nSo ""STAMP"" seems a good candidate: S(1), T(2), A(3), M(4), P(5)\n\nBut in guess 2, we had T at position 4 marked ""-"", so T is in the word but not at position 4. If we place T at position 2 and it is correct, then we\'re lucky. If not, then T must be at position 5.\n\nIn this guess, we can test position 2 with T, and also test M and P for positions 4 and 5.\n\nIf the secret word is ""STAMP"", then we win.\n\nOtherwise, we get more feedback.\n\nAnother possibility: ""STAID"" with T at 2: positions 2=T, 4=I, 5=D.\n\nBut STAID: S-T-A-I-D.\n\nTest I and D.\n\nBoth seem good.\n\nOr ""STA N D"" -> N eliminated.\n\nSo STAID is a possibility.\n\nI think STAID and STAMP are both good.\n\nBut consider: ""STAID"" uses I and D, and ""STAMP"" uses M and P. Which has more common letters? I and D are common, M and P also.\n\nOther options: ""STA G E"" -> E elim.\n\n""STALK"" L elim.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""STAID"" for more vowels.\n\nBut STAID: S-T-A-I-D.\n\nPosition 3 is A, fixed.\n\nNote that position 4 is I, a vowel, position 5 D.\n\nAlso, T at position 2.\n\nSo we can try this.\n\nOr to not place T prematurely, we could choose a word that doesn\'t have T but tests position 2 and 5 differently? But T must be in a position we haven\'t tested, either 2 or 5.\n\nIf we don\'t include T, then the feedback won\'t tell us where T is? But if we include T, we can tell.\n\nBut perhaps use a word with T in position 5.\n\nFor example: ""S O A P T""  - not a word? \n""SPOAT"" not a word.\n\n""S K A L T"" L elim.\n\nAnother word: ""SOUTH"" not.\n\n""S H A F T"" - SHAFT is a word? S, H, A, F, T. But position 2 is H, position 4 is F, position 5 is T. And position 3 is A fixed. So SHAFT.\n\nThis tests H at position 2, F at position 4, T at position 5.\n\nSince T is present, And not at 4, so at position 5 it should be correct if appropriate.\n\nWe can use SHAFT.\n\nBut is SHAFT common? It is a English word.\n\nIn SHAFT:\n- Position 1: S (fixed)\n- Position 2: H\n- Position 3: A (fixed)\n- Position 4: F\n- Position 5: T\n\nWe will get feedback on H, F, T.\n\nSince we know T is present, if at position 5 we put T, it might be correct or not.\n\nSimilarly, F and H are new.\n\nLet\'s decide between STAID, STAMP, or SHAFT.\n\nAnother word: ""SHAPT"" not a word.\n\nI think STAID is widely accepted as a word meaning sedate, respectable.\n\nSimilarly, STAMP is common.\n\nSHAFT is also common.\n\nBut in terms of information: STAID places T at position 2. SHAFT places T at position 5.\n\nSince we want to find out where T is, either way is useful.\n\nBut let me choose STAMP for its commonality.\n\nSo to guess: STAMP\n\n<guess>STAMP</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: Letters C, R, N, E are absent from the word (x). Letter A is present and in the correct position (✓), revealing that the 3rd letter is A. Therefore, the secret word has the form _ _ A _ _.\n- **Guess 2 (SALTY)**: \n  - S is present and in the correct position (✓), revealing that the 1st letter is S.\n  - A is present but in the wrong position (-). However, since we know A must be in position 3, this implies the secret word has at least two A\'s, and one of them is in position 3.\n  - L and Y are absent (x).\n  - T is present (-) but not in position 4.\n\nConstraints identified:\n- **Known Positions**: 1st letter is S, 3rd letter is A → Secret word format: S _ A _ _.\n- **Present Letters (must be included)**: A (due to multiple occurrences), T (and T cannot be in position 4).\n- **Absent Letters (cannot be included)**: C, R, N, E, L, Y.\n- **Possible Positions for T**: Must be in position 2 or 5 (only remaining positions, since it can\'t be in 4).\n- **Other Positions**: Test position 2 and 5, and determine the letter at position 4.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- **Strategy**: Place T in position 2 to test if it belongs there, as it is a high-frequency letter and must appear. This helps narrow down the letter at position 5. Use common English letters not yet tested or eliminated (avoiding C, R, N, E, L, Y).\n- **Chosen Word: STAMP**\n  - S (1st position): Confirmed correct (from previous feedback).\n  - T (2nd position): Tests if T is in position 2.\n  - A (3rd position): Confirmed correct.\n  - M (4th position): Tests a new common consonant.\n  - P (5th position): Tests a new common consonant.\n- **Advantages**: \n  - Efficiently tests T in position 2 while covering new letters (M and P).\n  - If T is not in position 2, the feedback will confirm it must be in position 5.\n\n<guess>STAMP</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)\nGuess 3: STAMP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) A(✓) M(x) P(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(✓) at position 3, N(x), E(x)
- So the secret word has A in position 3, and letters C, R, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: SALTY -> S(✓) at position 1, A(-) at position 2, L(x), T(-) at position 4, Y(x)
- S is in position 1 (correct).
- A is present but not at position 2 -> but we know from guess 1 that A is at position 3. The A(-) for position 2 indicates either the secret word has another A (at least two) or there was a mistake? 
  However, we have to trust the feedback: the letter A is in the word but not in position 2.
- L and Y are absent.
- T is present but not at position 4.

Guess 3: STAMP -> S(✓) at position 1, T(-) at position 2, A(✓) at position 3, M(x), P(x)
- S correct at position 1 -> confirmed.
- T is present but not at position 2.
- A correct at position 3 -> confirmed.
- M and P absent.

Now we can update our knowledge:

- Secret word format: position 1: S, position 3: A -> so the word is S ? A ? ?
- Present letters: A (at position 3), T (present but not at position 4, and now not at position 2) -> so T must be in position 5 (since position 1 and 3 are fixed, and positions 2 and 4 and 5 are the only options, but T is not at position 2 and not at position 4 -> must be at position 5).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, Y, M, P.

Therefore, the word must be: S ? A ? T

Because T must be in position 5 (only position left).

Also, we know:
- Position 2: not A (from SALTY), and not T (from STAMP), and not any of the absent letters: so it must be from the remaining alphabet excluding absent: C,R,N,E,L,Y,M,P absent -> so available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.
- Position 4: cannot be T (from SALTY), and must be from same available letters, but we also know that the word has only the letters S, A, T, and two more.

But we don't know what the second letter or fourth letter is.

Moreover, since in SALTY, the A was marked as present but not at position 2? And in STAMP, A at position 3 is correct. But note that SALTY also had an A at position 2, which was marked as present but wrong position. Since the secret word has A at position 3 (and perhaps only one A?), but if only one A, then the SALTY feedback for A at position 2 should have been 'x', not '-'. Therefore, the secret word has at least two A's: one at position 3 and another elsewhere. But the only other positions are 2 or 4? In SALTY, we guessed A at position 2 and it was present but not there, so if there is a second A, it must be in position 4? Because position 1 is S, position 3 is A, position 5 is T.

So: the secret word is S ? A ? T, and it has a second A at position 4? Possibly.

But let's see the feedback: for SALTY, when we put A in position 2, feedback said present but wrong position. But if the secret word has A in position 4, then that would explain why A was marked present but not in position 2.

Similarly, in other positions.

So the secret word likely is: S ? A A T -> SA?AT? but position 4 would be A.

But we don't know position 2.

Or it could be S A ? A T, but then position 2 is A, but in SALTY we put A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position? Meaning that if the secret word had A at position 2, it should be marked as correct? Unless the secret word does not have A at position 2.

So if secret word is S A ? A T, then in SALTY we have A at position 2: if secret has A at position 2, then it should be ✓, but feedback said '-' meaning not correct position? So secret word cannot have A at position 2.

Therefore, if there is a second A, it must be at position 4.

So the word is S ? A A T.

Position 4 must be A.

Then position 2 is the only unknown.

And we know: position 2 must be a letter that is not absent: so from available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

The possibilities: S, ?, A, A, T -> so the word is S?AAT.

What 5-letter words fit the pattern S?AAT?

Examples:
- SC? But C eliminated -> no C
- SL? L eliminated
- SM? M eliminated
- SN? N eliminated
- SP? P eliminated
- SR? R eliminated
- ST? T is at the end? But position 2 is not T? Also, we have one T at the end. Moreover, if T is at position 2? But in STAMP we had T at position 2 and it was marked '-' meaning not there? So position 2 cannot be T.

Looking for English words: 
- S B A A T -> not a word
- S D A A T -> not a word
- S F A A T -> not a word
- S G A A T -> not a word
- S H A A T -> not a word
- S I A A T -> not a word
- S K A A T -> SKAAT? Not a word
- S O A A T -> SOAAT? Not a word
- S U A A T -> SUAAT? Not a word
- S W A A T -> SWAAT? Not a word

Perhaps ""SPAAT"" not a word.

This is problematic.

Maybe there is no second A? Then in SALTY, why was A at position 2 marked present? 

Unless the feedback for A in SALTY was referring to the A at position 3? But since it was guessed at position 2, it should not affect.

Rules: in Wordle, feedback is per occurrence. Since no other A was in the guess SALTY, the A at position 2 must be the one that appears elsewhere.

So the secret word must have at least two A's: one at position 3 and another at position 4? But we try to fit:

If S _ A A T, but _ can be several:

For example: 
- SQUAT: but U and Q? Positions: S,Q,U,A,T -> but position 3 would be U? But we need position 3 to be A, so not SQUAT.

S _ A A T: 
Position 1: S
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: A
Position 4: A
Position 5: T

So the word is in the form of S?AAT.

The only common word I know of that fits is ""STAAT"" which is not an English word; it's Dutch.

Perhaps ""SABAT"" not a word.

Another possibility: the word is ""S A T A something"" but no, we have position 5 as T.

Perhaps I am wrong about position 5.

Let's re-examine: from guess 2: TA at position 4 is present but not at position 4? So T is present.

From guess 3: T at position 2 is present but not at position 2? So T is present but not at 2.

And we have positions: 1, 3 fixed; 2, 4,5 available for T? But in word, only three positions available: 2,4,5.

But T is not at 2 (from STAMP) and not at 4 (from SALTY), so by process of elimination, it must be at position 5.

Unless there is a flaw.

Another possibility: the secret word has two T's? Then T could be at position 4 and position 2? But feedback from SALTY said T at position 4 is not present there? But if there is a T at position 4, then it should be marked as present. If not at position 4, but elsewhere.

With position 5 being T, we have the pattern S ? A ? T.

With at least two A's: one at position 3, and one at position 4? Or position 2? But position 2 cannot be A because in SALTY we guessed A at position 2 and it was not correct.

If position 4 is A, then in SALTY guess, when we put A at position 2 and it was marked present but not there, that matches.

But we need an English word: S X A Y T, with Y=A, so XAYT with Y=A -> S X A A T.

Now, what English words have the pattern S?AAT?

Upon searching: 
- ""SC ant"" no
- ""sleat"" not and has L

Perhaps ""swat"" is 4 letters.

I recall ""SABAt"" not.

Another word: ""st A A T"" but that's not.

Perhaps ""SHAKT"" not valid.

Maybe the second A is not in position 4. Since position 3 is A, the only other positions for a second A are 2 or 4 or 5. But position 5 is T, so if position 5 is T, then cannot be A. Position 2 cannot be A (from SALTY feedback). Therefore, there must be an A in position 4.

But there are no common English words of the form S?AAT.

Unless we made a mistake in the available letters.

Perhaps T can be in position 4? But in SALTY, we put T in position 4 and it was marked present but not in position 4. But if the secret word has T in position 4 and we out T there, it would be marked as correct (✓), not '-'. So it must not be in position 4.

Similarly in position 2, not correct.

So the only spot is position 5.

But then the second A must be in position 4, but position 4 is A and position 5 is T.

So the only unknown is position 2.

And for S?AAT to be a word, it must be ""STAAT"" which is not English.

Or in American English, there is ""STAAT"" no.

Perhaps ""SPAAT"" not.

Another idea: maybe the secret word has T only once, at position 5, and has only one A, at position 3.

Then for SALTY, when we put A in position 2, it should be marked absent (x) because the letter A is at position 3, not at 2 and no other A.

But the feedback was A(-), meaning present but wrong position. So it must be present elsewhere.

So there must be two A's.

But no common word ""S?AAT"".

Unless the positions: secret word has S in 1, position 2 not A, position 3 A, position 4 not A, position 5 T.

So if there is another A, it must be in position 4? But we have position 5 as T, so position 4 must be A for the second A.

But that's the issue.

Perhaps the feedback is for the letter, not the occurrence. But rules are clear: for the letter, if it is present in the word in a different position.

But if there is only one A in the secret word at position 3, then when we guess A in position 2, it should be marked '-' present but wrong position? Only if there is another occurrence? No. Standard Wordle: if there is only one A, and it's not in the guessed position, then it gets '-' if present elsewhere. So if the secret word has only one A at position 3, and we guess A at position 2, it would be marked '-', and then we would think it is in the word but not at position 2, which is true.

That makes sense.

In guess 2 (SALTY), we had A at position 2, but the secret word has A at position 3, so it is present but in a different position, so '-' is correct.

No need for two A's.

The secret word has only one A, at position 3.

Then the feedback is consistent.

So secret word: S ? A ? T with only one A? But we guessed A at position 2 and it was not there, but the letter A is present at position 3.

Then why in guess 2 feedback for A at position 2 gets '-'? Because the letter A is in the word but not in position 2 — which is true.

No contradiction.

Similarly, position 5 is T.

And there is no other A.

So secret word: S ? A ? T

Position 2 and position 4 to be filled.

Position 2: cannot be A also? It can be filled with other letter.

Absent letters: C,R,N,E,L,Y,M,P.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

Position 4: to be filled with one of these.

Now, possible English words with pattern: S ? A ? T.

Examples:
- SOAPT -> O and P? P is absent? P is absent from guess 3 P(x) -> but in 'STAMP', P was at position 5 and marked x, so P is absent.

Similarly, M absent.

So we know: C,R,N,E,L,Y,M,P absent.

Also from guess 2: L and Y absent.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

Also the word must include only these, and not duplicate if not in word.

Possible words:
- SH ALT -> L absent, T also we have position 5 T.

""SHART"" -> R absent and we have T in position 5? but SHART has T? S,H,A,R,T -> position 4 is R, which is absent.

""SW ADT"" not a word.

""SWAPT"" P absent and P is not allowed.

""SCANT"" C absent and N absent.

""S B A G T"" -> possible ""SBAGT"" not a word.

""S D A G T"" -> not.

Common words:
- ""SHAFT"" -> SHAFT: S,H,A,F,T -> position 1 is S, 2 is H, 3 is A, 4 is F, 5 is T.

Check available letters: H, F are available? Yes.

Also, does ""SHAFT"" use only available letters? It has H, F, T.

T is at position 5.

And we know T is present, and position 5 is where it should be? We haven't guessed position 5 before, so it might be correct or not.

But in SHAFT, position 4 is F.

If we guess ""SHAFT"", and the secret word has F, it will be in position 4.

Also, it tests H at position 2.

Another word: ""SHADT"" not a word.

""SH V A T"" not.

"" SHIVT"" not.

"" SH I A T"" -> ""SHIAT"" not a word.

"" DATS"" not.

"" DW AT"" not.

"" KATS"" not.

"" OATS"" has O, A, T, S but won't fit pattern.

We need a word with third letter A and fifth letter T.

"" BEAST"" has E absent.

""FE AST"" E absent.

""GR ADT"" not.

"" HAD ST"" not.

""HEADT"" not.

"" ID T"" not.

""K A T inG"" too long.

I think ""SHAFT"" is a valid word and fits.

Another: ""STAFF"" but F and F? But S,T,A,F,F -> position 2 is T, but from guess 3, T at position 2 was marked '-' ( present but not at position 2), so position 2 is not T? So SHAFT has H at position 2, not T.

So position 2 in SHAFT is H.

We can try.

""SHIFT"" -> I, F -> position 3 is I, but we need position 3 to be A? Not.

Only words with position 3 A and position 5 T.

Other options: ""SKA T T"" with T repeated? And K,T? But position 4 must be T? Which would be not allowed since we have position 5 T, and feedback from SALTY said T not at position 4.

Also, ""SKAT"" not 5 letters.

""SMALT"" L and M absent.

""SUATT"" not a word.

""SWEAT"" E absent.

I think ""SHAFT"" is a common word.

Also ""SOFAT"" not a word.

""SPRAT"" R and P absent.

Therefore, we should guess ""SHAFT"".

But in SHAFT, we are using F, which is new.

If the secret word is ""SHAFT"", then we win.

Otherwise, feedback will give us information on H, F, etc.

As for T, we know it is present and not at position 2 or 4, so position 5 is the only spot.

So guess ""SHAFT"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: CRANE → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)**
   - A is correct and in position 3.
   - C, R, N, E are absent from the word.
   - Secret word format: `_ _ A _ _`.

2. **Guess 2: SALTY → FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)**
   - S is correct and in position 1.
   - A is present in the word but not in position 2.
   - L and Y are absent.
   - T is present but not in position 4.
   - Secret word format: `S _ A _ _` (since S is fixed at position 1 and A at position 3).
   - Absent letters now include C, R, N, E, L, Y.

3. **Guess 3: STAMP → FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) A(✓) M(x) P(x)**
   - S confirmed at position 1.
   - T is present but not in position 2.
   - A confirmed at position 3.
   - M and P are absent.
   - Updated absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, Y, M, P.
   - Secret word format: `S ? A ? ?`.

### Key Deductions:
- **Positions**:
  - Position 1: S (fixed).
  - Position 3: A (fixed).
  - Positions 2, 4, and 5 are unknown.
- **Letters**:
  - T must be in the word (from SALTY and STAMP feedback), but not in positions 2 or 4.
  - The only remaining position for T is position 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are fixed, and T cannot be in 2 or 4).
  - Therefore, secret word format: `S ? A ? T`.
- **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, L, Y, M, P are eliminated and cannot appear anywhere.
- **Possible Letters for Positions 2 and 4**: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

### Hypothesis on A:
- In SALTY, A was guessed at position 2 and marked `-` (present but wrong position), but since position 3 is fixed as A, this does not necessarily imply a second A.
  - Explanation: A is correctly at position 3, so the `-` for A in SALTY indicates that the position 2 guess was wrong, not that there is a duplicate A. There is no contradiction; position 2 simply holds a different letter.
- Thus, the secret word likely has only one A (at position 3).

### Choosing the Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test letters for position 2 and position 4, confirming the word is `S ? A ? T`.
- **Constraints**:
  - Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, E, L, Y, M, P).
  - Position 2 and 4 must be filled with available letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).
  - Use common letters to maximize information.
- **Candidate Words**:
  - SHAFT: Tests H at position 2 and F at position 4. This is a valid English word and fits the pattern `S ? A ? T`.
  - Alternative like STAID contains T at position 2 (already tested and incorrect) or SHAIT (invalid). SHAFT efficiently tests two new letters.
- **Why SHAFT?**:
  - Tests H and F, common consonants.
  - Confirms position 5 is T implicitly.
  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal whether H or F are present and in what positions.

Given the feedback and deductions, **SHAFT** is selected as the next guess.

<guess>SHAFT</guess>",SHAFT,"We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(✓) at position 3, N(x), E(x)
- So the secret word has A in position 3, and letters C, R, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: SALTY -> S(✓) at position 1, A(-) at position 2, L(x), T(-) at position 4, Y(x)
- S is in position 1 (correct).
- A is present but not at position 2 -> but we know from guess 1 that A is at position 3. The A(-) for position 2 indicates either the secret word has another A (at least two) or there was a mistake? 
  However, we have to trust the feedback: the letter A is in the word but not in position 2.
- L and Y are absent.
- T is present but not at position 4.

Guess 3: STAMP -> S(✓) at position 1, T(-) at position 2, A(✓) at position 3, M(x), P(x)
- S correct at position 1 -> confirmed.
- T is present but not at position 2.
- A correct at position 3 -> confirmed.
- M and P absent.

Now we can update our knowledge:

- Secret word format: position 1: S, position 3: A -> so the word is S ? A ? ?
- Present letters: A (at position 3), T (present but not at position 4, and now not at position 2) -> so T must be in position 5 (since position 1 and 3 are fixed, and positions 2 and 4 and 5 are the only options, but T is not at position 2 and not at position 4 -> must be at position 5).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, Y, M, P.

Therefore, the word must be: S ? A ? T

Because T must be in position 5 (only position left).

Also, we know:
- Position 2: not A (from SALTY), and not T (from STAMP), and not any of the absent letters: so it must be from the remaining alphabet excluding absent: C,R,N,E,L,Y,M,P absent -> so available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.
- Position 4: cannot be T (from SALTY), and must be from same available letters, but we also know that the word has only the letters S, A, T, and two more.

But we don't know what the second letter or fourth letter is.

Moreover, since in SALTY, the A was marked as present but not at position 2? And in STAMP, A at position 3 is correct. But note that SALTY also had an A at position 2, which was marked as present but wrong position. Since the secret word has A at position 3 (and perhaps only one A?), but if only one A, then the SALTY feedback for A at position 2 should have been 'x', not '-'. Therefore, the secret word has at least two A's: one at position 3 and another elsewhere. But the only other positions are 2 or 4? In SALTY, we guessed A at position 2 and it was present but not there, so if there is a second A, it must be in position 4? Because position 1 is S, position 3 is A, position 5 is T.

So: the secret word is S ? A ? T, and it has a second A at position 4? Possibly.

But let's see the feedback: for SALTY, when we put A in position 2, feedback said present but wrong position. But if the secret word has A in position 4, then that would explain why A was marked present but not in position 2.

Similarly, in other positions.

So the secret word likely is: S ? A A T -> SA?AT? but position 4 would be A.

But we don't know position 2.

Or it could be S A ? A T, but then position 2 is A, but in SALTY we put A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position? Meaning that if the secret word had A at position 2, it should be marked as correct? Unless the secret word does not have A at position 2.

So if secret word is S A ? A T, then in SALTY we have A at position 2: if secret has A at position 2, then it should be ✓, but feedback said '-' meaning not correct position? So secret word cannot have A at position 2.

Therefore, if there is a second A, it must be at position 4.

So the word is S ? A A T.

Position 4 must be A.

Then position 2 is the only unknown.

And we know: position 2 must be a letter that is not absent: so from available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

The possibilities: S, ?, A, A, T -> so the word is S?AAT.

What 5-letter words fit the pattern S?AAT?

Examples:
- SC? But C eliminated -> no C
- SL? L eliminated
- SM? M eliminated
- SN? N eliminated
- SP? P eliminated
- SR? R eliminated
- ST? T is at the end? But position 2 is not T? Also, we have one T at the end. Moreover, if T is at position 2? But in STAMP we had T at position 2 and it was marked '-' meaning not there? So position 2 cannot be T.

Looking for English words: 
- S B A A T -> not a word
- S D A A T -> not a word
- S F A A T -> not a word
- S G A A T -> not a word
- S H A A T -> not a word
- S I A A T -> not a word
- S K A A T -> SKAAT? Not a word
- S O A A T -> SOAAT? Not a word
- S U A A T -> SUAAT? Not a word
- S W A A T -> SWAAT? Not a word

Perhaps ""SPAAT"" not a word.

This is problematic.

Maybe there is no second A? Then in SALTY, why was A at position 2 marked present? 

Unless the feedback for A in SALTY was referring to the A at position 3? But since it was guessed at position 2, it should not affect.

Rules: in Wordle, feedback is per occurrence. Since no other A was in the guess SALTY, the A at position 2 must be the one that appears elsewhere.

So the secret word must have at least two A's: one at position 3 and another at position 4? But we try to fit:

If S _ A A T, but _ can be several:

For example: 
- SQUAT: but U and Q? Positions: S,Q,U,A,T -> but position 3 would be U? But we need position 3 to be A, so not SQUAT.

S _ A A T: 
Position 1: S
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: A
Position 4: A
Position 5: T

So the word is in the form of S?AAT.

The only common word I know of that fits is ""STAAT"" which is not an English word; it's Dutch.

Perhaps ""SABAT"" not a word.

Another possibility: the word is ""S A T A something"" but no, we have position 5 as T.

Perhaps I am wrong about position 5.

Let's re-examine: from guess 2: TA at position 4 is present but not at position 4? So T is present.

From guess 3: T at position 2 is present but not at position 2? So T is present but not at 2.

And we have positions: 1, 3 fixed; 2, 4,5 available for T? But in word, only three positions available: 2,4,5.

But T is not at 2 (from STAMP) and not at 4 (from SALTY), so by process of elimination, it must be at position 5.

Unless there is a flaw.

Another possibility: the secret word has two T's? Then T could be at position 4 and position 2? But feedback from SALTY said T at position 4 is not present there? But if there is a T at position 4, then it should be marked as present. If not at position 4, but elsewhere.

With position 5 being T, we have the pattern S ? A ? T.

With at least two A's: one at position 3, and one at position 4? Or position 2? But position 2 cannot be A because in SALTY we guessed A at position 2 and it was not correct.

If position 4 is A, then in SALTY guess, when we put A at position 2 and it was marked present but not there, that matches.

But we need an English word: S X A Y T, with Y=A, so XAYT with Y=A -> S X A A T.

Now, what English words have the pattern S?AAT?

Upon searching: 
- ""SC ant"" no
- ""sleat"" not and has L

Perhaps ""swat"" is 4 letters.

I recall ""SABAt"" not.

Another word: ""st A A T"" but that's not.

Perhaps ""SHAKT"" not valid.

Maybe the second A is not in position 4. Since position 3 is A, the only other positions for a second A are 2 or 4 or 5. But position 5 is T, so if position 5 is T, then cannot be A. Position 2 cannot be A (from SALTY feedback). Therefore, there must be an A in position 4.

But there are no common English words of the form S?AAT.

Unless we made a mistake in the available letters.

Perhaps T can be in position 4? But in SALTY, we put T in position 4 and it was marked present but not in position 4. But if the secret word has T in position 4 and we out T there, it would be marked as correct (✓), not '-'. So it must not be in position 4.

Similarly in position 2, not correct.

So the only spot is position 5.

But then the second A must be in position 4, but position 4 is A and position 5 is T.

So the only unknown is position 2.

And for S?AAT to be a word, it must be ""STAAT"" which is not English.

Or in American English, there is ""STAAT"" no.

Perhaps ""SPAAT"" not.

Another idea: maybe the secret word has T only once, at position 5, and has only one A, at position 3.

Then for SALTY, when we put A in position 2, it should be marked absent (x) because the letter A is at position 3, not at 2 and no other A.

But the feedback was A(-), meaning present but wrong position. So it must be present elsewhere.

So there must be two A's.

But no common word ""S?AAT"".

Unless the positions: secret word has S in 1, position 2 not A, position 3 A, position 4 not A, position 5 T.

So if there is another A, it must be in position 4? But we have position 5 as T, so position 4 must be A for the second A.

But that's the issue.

Perhaps the feedback is for the letter, not the occurrence. But rules are clear: for the letter, if it is present in the word in a different position.

But if there is only one A in the secret word at position 3, then when we guess A in position 2, it should be marked '-' present but wrong position? Only if there is another occurrence? No. Standard Wordle: if there is only one A, and it's not in the guessed position, then it gets '-' if present elsewhere. So if the secret word has only one A at position 3, and we guess A at position 2, it would be marked '-', and then we would think it is in the word but not at position 2, which is true.

That makes sense.

In guess 2 (SALTY), we had A at position 2, but the secret word has A at position 3, so it is present but in a different position, so '-' is correct.

No need for two A's.

The secret word has only one A, at position 3.

Then the feedback is consistent.

So secret word: S ? A ? T with only one A? But we guessed A at position 2 and it was not there, but the letter A is present at position 3.

Then why in guess 2 feedback for A at position 2 gets '-'? Because the letter A is in the word but not in position 2 — which is true.

No contradiction.

Similarly, position 5 is T.

And there is no other A.

So secret word: S ? A ? T

Position 2 and position 4 to be filled.

Position 2: cannot be A also? It can be filled with other letter.

Absent letters: C,R,N,E,L,Y,M,P.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

Position 4: to be filled with one of these.

Now, possible English words with pattern: S ? A ? T.

Examples:
- SOAPT -> O and P? P is absent? P is absent from guess 3 P(x) -> but in 'STAMP', P was at position 5 and marked x, so P is absent.

Similarly, M absent.

So we know: C,R,N,E,L,Y,M,P absent.

Also from guess 2: L and Y absent.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

Also the word must include only these, and not duplicate if not in word.

Possible words:
- SH ALT -> L absent, T also we have position 5 T.

""SHART"" -> R absent and we have T in position 5? but SHART has T? S,H,A,R,T -> position 4 is R, which is absent.

""SW ADT"" not a word.

""SWAPT"" P absent and P is not allowed.

""SCANT"" C absent and N absent.

""S B A G T"" -> possible ""SBAGT"" not a word.

""S D A G T"" -> not.

Common words:
- ""SHAFT"" -> SHAFT: S,H,A,F,T -> position 1 is S, 2 is H, 3 is A, 4 is F, 5 is T.

Check available letters: H, F are available? Yes.

Also, does ""SHAFT"" use only available letters? It has H, F, T.

T is at position 5.

And we know T is present, and position 5 is where it should be? We haven't guessed position 5 before, so it might be correct or not.

But in SHAFT, position 4 is F.

If we guess ""SHAFT"", and the secret word has F, it will be in position 4.

Also, it tests H at position 2.

Another word: ""SHADT"" not a word.

""SH V A T"" not.

"" SHIVT"" not.

"" SH I A T"" -> ""SHIAT"" not a word.

"" DATS"" not.

"" DW AT"" not.

"" KATS"" not.

"" OATS"" has O, A, T, S but won't fit pattern.

We need a word with third letter A and fifth letter T.

"" BEAST"" has E absent.

""FE AST"" E absent.

""GR ADT"" not.

"" HAD ST"" not.

""HEADT"" not.

"" ID T"" not.

""K A T inG"" too long.

I think ""SHAFT"" is a valid word and fits.

Another: ""STAFF"" but F and F? But S,T,A,F,F -> position 2 is T, but from guess 3, T at position 2 was marked '-' ( present but not at position 2), so position 2 is not T? So SHAFT has H at position 2, not T.

So position 2 in SHAFT is H.

We can try.

""SHIFT"" -> I, F -> position 3 is I, but we need position 3 to be A? Not.

Only words with position 3 A and position 5 T.

Other options: ""SKA T T"" with T repeated? And K,T? But position 4 must be T? Which would be not allowed since we have position 5 T, and feedback from SALTY said T not at position 4.

Also, ""SKAT"" not 5 letters.

""SMALT"" L and M absent.

""SUATT"" not a word.

""SWEAT"" E absent.

I think ""SHAFT"" is a common word.

Also ""SOFAT"" not a word.

""SPRAT"" R and P absent.

Therefore, we should guess ""SHAFT"".

But in SHAFT, we are using F, which is new.

If the secret word is ""SHAFT"", then we win.

Otherwise, feedback will give us information on H, F, etc.

As for T, we know it is present and not at position 2 or 4, so position 5 is the only spot.

So guess ""SHAFT"".

<guess>SHAFT</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: CRANE → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)**
   - A is correct and in position 3.
   - C, R, N, E are absent from the word.
   - Secret word format: `_ _ A _ _`.

2. **Guess 2: SALTY → FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)**
   - S is correct and in position 1.
   - A is present in the word but not in position 2.
   - L and Y are absent.
   - T is present but not in position 4.
   - Secret word format: `S _ A _ _` (since S is fixed at position 1 and A at position 3).
   - Absent letters now include C, R, N, E, L, Y.

3. **Guess 3: STAMP → FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) A(✓) M(x) P(x)**
   - S confirmed at position 1.
   - T is present but not in position 2.
   - A confirmed at position 3.
   - M and P are absent.
   - Updated absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, Y, M, P.
   - Secret word format: `S ? A ? ?`.

### Key Deductions:
- **Positions**:
  - Position 1: S (fixed).
  - Position 3: A (fixed).
  - Positions 2, 4, and 5 are unknown.
- **Letters**:
  - T must be in the word (from SALTY and STAMP feedback), but not in positions 2 or 4.
  - The only remaining position for T is position 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are fixed, and T cannot be in 2 or 4).
  - Therefore, secret word format: `S ? A ? T`.
- **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, L, Y, M, P are eliminated and cannot appear anywhere.
- **Possible Letters for Positions 2 and 4**: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

### Hypothesis on A:
- In SALTY, A was guessed at position 2 and marked `-` (present but wrong position), but since position 3 is fixed as A, this does not necessarily imply a second A.
  - Explanation: A is correctly at position 3, so the `-` for A in SALTY indicates that the position 2 guess was wrong, not that there is a duplicate A. There is no contradiction; position 2 simply holds a different letter.
- Thus, the secret word likely has only one A (at position 3).

### Choosing the Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test letters for position 2 and position 4, confirming the word is `S ? A ? T`.
- **Constraints**:
  - Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, E, L, Y, M, P).
  - Position 2 and 4 must be filled with available letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).
  - Use common letters to maximize information.
- **Candidate Words**:
  - SHAFT: Tests H at position 2 and F at position 4. This is a valid English word and fits the pattern `S ? A ? T`.
  - Alternative like STAID contains T at position 2 (already tested and incorrect) or SHAIT (invalid). SHAFT efficiently tests two new letters.
- **Why SHAFT?**:
  - Tests H and F, common consonants.
  - Confirms position 5 is T implicitly.
  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal whether H or F are present and in what positions.

Given the feedback and deductions, **SHAFT** is selected as the next guess.",Guess 4: SHAFT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) F(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
