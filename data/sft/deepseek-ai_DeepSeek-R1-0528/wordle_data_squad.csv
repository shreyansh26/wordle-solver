 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) - not in the word
R(x) - not in the word
A(-) - in the word but wrong position
N(x) - not in the word
E(x) - not in the word

So from this feedback we know:
- The letter ""A"" is present in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was at position 3, which is index 2, and we got '-', meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Now, since ""A"" is in the word but not in the third position, it must be in one of the other four positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E (because they are not in the secret word)
- Includes the letter ""A"" but not in the third position (to avoid getting the same feedback for A, and to test other positions)
- Preferably includes other common letters to get more feedback.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test A in a different position and cover more common consonants.

Since A is the only known letter, we should consider words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Also, trying more vowels might be useful. We haven't tried O, I, U yet.

A common strategy is to use a word with A and another vowel, and some common consonants.

Possible choices: 
- Place A at position 1: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ADOPT"", ""AGLOW"" - but note we must avoid C, R, N, E.
- Place A at position 2: e.g., ""SALAD"" (but S is common) - but SALAD has duplicate A? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know yet, but feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess twice. So we can use words with duplicates if necessary, but maybe avoid for now to test more letters.

Let's brainstorm words without C,R,N,E and with A in a new position.

Example: 
- A at position 1: ""ABHOR"", ""ADAPT"", ""ALIGN"", ""ALOFT"", ""AMPLY"", ""AWASH"", ""AXIOM"", ""ABOUT"" -> but ABOUT has U and O and B, T. However, U and O are vowels we haven't tried.

But ADAPT has D and P and T, but also A and P? We must avoid duplicate letters? Actually, in our guess we can have duplicates? But the feedback will tell us if the secret word has duplicates. However, since we know A is only once in the feedback? The feedback shows one A as '-', meaning there is at least one A. But it could be more? So we might try a word with one A to avoid confusion.

But ADAPT has two As? Actually, no: A-D-A-P-T? Wait, ADAPT: positions 1:A, 2:D, 3:A, 4:P, 5:T -> but position 3 is A. We must avoid A at position 3 because we know it's not there? Actually, we are allowed to put A at position 3 again? But if the secret word has only one A, then if we put A at position 3 again, and it's wrong, we get 'x' for that A. But currently we know that A is in the word and not at position 3. So if we put A at a different position, we can see if it's at that position.

But note: if the secret word has two A's, then we might get '-', even at position 3? But we already know that at position 3 we got '-' meaning that the A was in the word but not at that location? Actually, no: the feedback we got was for the first occurrence of A? Wait, no: the feedback is per position.

In ""crane"", the A was at position 3 (starting index 1: C1, R2, A3, N4, E5). We got A3 as '-', meaning that there is an A in the word, but not at position 3. That doesn't tell us about duplicate A's.

If the secret word has two A's and one of them is at position 3? Then we would have gotten a '✓' for position 3? But we didn't, so position 3 cannot be A. But there might be another A at another position.

So we should not put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. We'll try a different position.

Therefore, for the next guess, we try a word with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Since we also want to maximize coverage of new letters, I propose using a word with A in the first position.

Consider ""AUDIO"". This has A (position 1) and U,D,I,O. But note: we have only used one A, and it tests four new letters (U,D,I,O) and we know A is one letter. However, ""AUDIO"" has vowels mostly. Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" has A? No, ABOUT is O at position 1? Wait, ABOUT: O,B,O,U,T? No: A-B-O-U-T? That has A at position 1? Actually, ABOUT: A at position 1? Wait, no. ABOUT: the letters are A, B, O, U, T? In order: position 1: A, 2: B, 3: O, 4: U, 5: T? Yes! So ABOUT has A at position 1.

But does ABOUT contain forbidden letters? We must avoid C,R,N,E. ABOUT has: A,B,O,U,T. None of C,R,N,E. So it's okay.

But ""AUDIO"" similarly: A,U,D,I,O -> no forbidden letters.

Alternatively, ""ALOFT"": A,L,O,F,T -> also good.

Another option: ""STAMP"" has S,T,A,M,P. A is at position 3? Wait, STAMP: S,T,A,M,P -> A is at position 3? We don't want to put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. So we avoid that.

We need a word that puts A either at 1,2,4,5.

Let me consider:

- Position 1: about, audio, adapt (but adapt has A at 1 and 3? and we don't want A at 3 -> so avoid using A at 3 again if possible). Note: adapt has two A's: A-D-A-P-T -> so positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:A, 4:P, 5:T. So we have A at 3 again. We might get this one wrong again? We already know position 3 isn't A? So we don't want to use a word that has A at position 3. Therefore, we avoid words with A at position 3.

So we choose a word without A in position 3.

Therefore, ABOUT: A1, B2, O3, U4, T5 -> no A at 3.
AUDIO: A1, U2, D3, I4, O5 -> also no A at 3.

Alternatively, SALAD: S1, A2, L3, A4, D5 -> but we have an A at position 2 and 4? And position 3 is L. But SALAD has duplicate A? We don't know if the secret word has duplicate A. It might confuse? Better to avoid duplicate letters to test more letters? So preferably, we choose a word without duplicates for now.

Both ABOUT and AUDIO have unique letters: ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> all distinct? Yes. AUDIO: A,U,D,I,O -> distinct.

ALOFT: A,L,O,F,T -> distinct, and A at position 1? Wait, ALOFT: A1, L2, O3, F4, T5 -> yes.

But ""ALOFT"" and ""ABOUT"" both have A at position 1. Which one?

Since we also have more vowels to try, AUDIO tests U, I, O? That's three vowels? Maybe too many vowels? But consonants are also important.

Another word: ""TABLE"": but we must avoid E -> we can't use E because we know it's not in the word. So TABLE is not allowed.

""MANLY"": M,A,N, but N is forbidden (we got N as x in ""crane""), so must avoid N.

""SHARP"": S,H,A,R, but R is forbidden because we got R(x) -> not in the word? So R is absent. Must avoid R.

Similarly, we must avoid C,R,N,E.

So about the words: 

- AUDIO: A,U,D,I,O -> forbidden letters? None. Also distinct letters.

- ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct, no forbidden.

- ALOFT: A,L,O,F,T -> distinct, no forbidden.

Which one is better? AUDIO has U and D and I and O? AUDIO tests a lot of vowels? We need to cover consonants too? Maybe?

But we don't have a strong preference? Another word: ""STALK"" -> A at position 4? Position 4: STALK: S,T,A,L,K -> A is at position 3? Wait: S1,T2,A3,L4,K5? A at position 3 -> we don't want that.

Another: ""PLAIN"" -> has N? No, we can't use N.

""QUAKE"" -> has E? Forbidden.

""WHARF"" -> has R? Forbidden.

So let's stick with AUDIO or ABOUT.

Alternatively, ""BAWDY"": B,A,W,D,Y -> A at position 2? BAWDY: B1,A2,W3,D4,Y5 -> A not at position 3? Position 2? So that would test A at a new position.

Similarly, we might want to test A at position 4? Words like: TESTA? A at position 5? But TESTA has E? Forbidden.

So let's try to pick a word with A in a position other than 3 and avoid forbidden letters.

Given the above, I think AUDIO is a good choice because:
- It tests five distinct letters including three vowels (U,I,O) and two consonants (A,D? Wait, A is vowel, D is consonant). Actually: A (vowel), U (vowel), D (consonant), I (vowel), O (vowel). So four vowels? But we already have A known? We are testing A at position 1? If we get a '✓', then we know A is at position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not at 1? Already we know it's in, so the '-' for A would not tell us new about presence? But it would tell us position 1 is wrong? So then we know A must be at position 2,4, or 5? 

But if we test A at position 1 and get 'x', that would be confusing? Because we know A is in the word? Actually, we would not get 'x' for A? We should get either '✓' if it's at position 1 or '-' if it's not at position 1 but present? Yes.

Similarly for position 2? But we are putting A only at position 1.

Therefore, either:

- A gets '✓': then position 1 is A → and we can build on that.

- A gets '-': then we know A is not at position 1 → and is elsewhere (since we know it's present).

So we can get more information.

So either ABOUT or AUDIO? Let me choose AUDIO because it includes D and I, which are common letters? 

But also, ABOUT has B and T? Which are common.

I think both are fine. Let me pick ""AUDIO"".

Therefore, second guess: ""AUDIO""

Response format: <guess>audio</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with -). So A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the second guess:
- Avoid using C, R, N, E.
- Include A in a position other than 3 to gather new positioning clues.
- Favor common letters not yet tested (B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Choose a word with distinct letters to maximize coverage.

""AUDIO"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A (in position 1, avoiding position 3) and new common letters U, D, I, O.
- Uses only distinct letters and avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).

This guess will provide feedback on A's position and test four new letters.

<guess>audio</guess>",audio,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) - not in the word
R(x) - not in the word
A(-) - in the word but wrong position
N(x) - not in the word
E(x) - not in the word

So from this feedback we know:
- The letter ""A"" is present in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was at position 3, which is index 2, and we got '-', meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Now, since ""A"" is in the word but not in the third position, it must be in one of the other four positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E (because they are not in the secret word)
- Includes the letter ""A"" but not in the third position (to avoid getting the same feedback for A, and to test other positions)
- Preferably includes other common letters to get more feedback.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test A in a different position and cover more common consonants.

Since A is the only known letter, we should consider words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Also, trying more vowels might be useful. We haven't tried O, I, U yet.

A common strategy is to use a word with A and another vowel, and some common consonants.

Possible choices: 
- Place A at position 1: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ADOPT"", ""AGLOW"" - but note we must avoid C, R, N, E.
- Place A at position 2: e.g., ""SALAD"" (but S is common) - but SALAD has duplicate A? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know yet, but feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess twice. So we can use words with duplicates if necessary, but maybe avoid for now to test more letters.

Let's brainstorm words without C,R,N,E and with A in a new position.

Example: 
- A at position 1: ""ABHOR"", ""ADAPT"", ""ALIGN"", ""ALOFT"", ""AMPLY"", ""AWASH"", ""AXIOM"", ""ABOUT"" -> but ABOUT has U and O and B, T. However, U and O are vowels we haven't tried.

But ADAPT has D and P and T, but also A and P? We must avoid duplicate letters? Actually, in our guess we can have duplicates? But the feedback will tell us if the secret word has duplicates. However, since we know A is only once in the feedback? The feedback shows one A as '-', meaning there is at least one A. But it could be more? So we might try a word with one A to avoid confusion.

But ADAPT has two As? Actually, no: A-D-A-P-T? Wait, ADAPT: positions 1:A, 2:D, 3:A, 4:P, 5:T -> but position 3 is A. We must avoid A at position 3 because we know it's not there? Actually, we are allowed to put A at position 3 again? But if the secret word has only one A, then if we put A at position 3 again, and it's wrong, we get 'x' for that A. But currently we know that A is in the word and not at position 3. So if we put A at a different position, we can see if it's at that position.

But note: if the secret word has two A's, then we might get '-', even at position 3? But we already know that at position 3 we got '-' meaning that the A was in the word but not at that location? Actually, no: the feedback we got was for the first occurrence of A? Wait, no: the feedback is per position.

In ""crane"", the A was at position 3 (starting index 1: C1, R2, A3, N4, E5). We got A3 as '-', meaning that there is an A in the word, but not at position 3. That doesn't tell us about duplicate A's.

If the secret word has two A's and one of them is at position 3? Then we would have gotten a '✓' for position 3? But we didn't, so position 3 cannot be A. But there might be another A at another position.

So we should not put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. We'll try a different position.

Therefore, for the next guess, we try a word with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Since we also want to maximize coverage of new letters, I propose using a word with A in the first position.

Consider ""AUDIO"". This has A (position 1) and U,D,I,O. But note: we have only used one A, and it tests four new letters (U,D,I,O) and we know A is one letter. However, ""AUDIO"" has vowels mostly. Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" has A? No, ABOUT is O at position 1? Wait, ABOUT: O,B,O,U,T? No: A-B-O-U-T? That has A at position 1? Actually, ABOUT: A at position 1? Wait, no. ABOUT: the letters are A, B, O, U, T? In order: position 1: A, 2: B, 3: O, 4: U, 5: T? Yes! So ABOUT has A at position 1.

But does ABOUT contain forbidden letters? We must avoid C,R,N,E. ABOUT has: A,B,O,U,T. None of C,R,N,E. So it's okay.

But ""AUDIO"" similarly: A,U,D,I,O -> no forbidden letters.

Alternatively, ""ALOFT"": A,L,O,F,T -> also good.

Another option: ""STAMP"" has S,T,A,M,P. A is at position 3? Wait, STAMP: S,T,A,M,P -> A is at position 3? We don't want to put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. So we avoid that.

We need a word that puts A either at 1,2,4,5.

Let me consider:

- Position 1: about, audio, adapt (but adapt has A at 1 and 3? and we don't want A at 3 -> so avoid using A at 3 again if possible). Note: adapt has two A's: A-D-A-P-T -> so positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:A, 4:P, 5:T. So we have A at 3 again. We might get this one wrong again? We already know position 3 isn't A? So we don't want to use a word that has A at position 3. Therefore, we avoid words with A at position 3.

So we choose a word without A in position 3.

Therefore, ABOUT: A1, B2, O3, U4, T5 -> no A at 3.
AUDIO: A1, U2, D3, I4, O5 -> also no A at 3.

Alternatively, SALAD: S1, A2, L3, A4, D5 -> but we have an A at position 2 and 4? And position 3 is L. But SALAD has duplicate A? We don't know if the secret word has duplicate A. It might confuse? Better to avoid duplicate letters to test more letters? So preferably, we choose a word without duplicates for now.

Both ABOUT and AUDIO have unique letters: ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> all distinct? Yes. AUDIO: A,U,D,I,O -> distinct.

ALOFT: A,L,O,F,T -> distinct, and A at position 1? Wait, ALOFT: A1, L2, O3, F4, T5 -> yes.

But ""ALOFT"" and ""ABOUT"" both have A at position 1. Which one?

Since we also have more vowels to try, AUDIO tests U, I, O? That's three vowels? Maybe too many vowels? But consonants are also important.

Another word: ""TABLE"": but we must avoid E -> we can't use E because we know it's not in the word. So TABLE is not allowed.

""MANLY"": M,A,N, but N is forbidden (we got N as x in ""crane""), so must avoid N.

""SHARP"": S,H,A,R, but R is forbidden because we got R(x) -> not in the word? So R is absent. Must avoid R.

Similarly, we must avoid C,R,N,E.

So about the words: 

- AUDIO: A,U,D,I,O -> forbidden letters? None. Also distinct letters.

- ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct, no forbidden.

- ALOFT: A,L,O,F,T -> distinct, no forbidden.

Which one is better? AUDIO has U and D and I and O? AUDIO tests a lot of vowels? We need to cover consonants too? Maybe?

But we don't have a strong preference? Another word: ""STALK"" -> A at position 4? Position 4: STALK: S,T,A,L,K -> A is at position 3? Wait: S1,T2,A3,L4,K5? A at position 3 -> we don't want that.

Another: ""PLAIN"" -> has N? No, we can't use N.

""QUAKE"" -> has E? Forbidden.

""WHARF"" -> has R? Forbidden.

So let's stick with AUDIO or ABOUT.

Alternatively, ""BAWDY"": B,A,W,D,Y -> A at position 2? BAWDY: B1,A2,W3,D4,Y5 -> A not at position 3? Position 2? So that would test A at a new position.

Similarly, we might want to test A at position 4? Words like: TESTA? A at position 5? But TESTA has E? Forbidden.

So let's try to pick a word with A in a position other than 3 and avoid forbidden letters.

Given the above, I think AUDIO is a good choice because:
- It tests five distinct letters including three vowels (U,I,O) and two consonants (A,D? Wait, A is vowel, D is consonant). Actually: A (vowel), U (vowel), D (consonant), I (vowel), O (vowel). So four vowels? But we already have A known? We are testing A at position 1? If we get a '✓', then we know A is at position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not at 1? Already we know it's in, so the '-' for A would not tell us new about presence? But it would tell us position 1 is wrong? So then we know A must be at position 2,4, or 5? 

But if we test A at position 1 and get 'x', that would be confusing? Because we know A is in the word? Actually, we would not get 'x' for A? We should get either '✓' if it's at position 1 or '-' if it's not at position 1 but present? Yes.

Similarly for position 2? But we are putting A only at position 1.

Therefore, either:

- A gets '✓': then position 1 is A → and we can build on that.

- A gets '-': then we know A is not at position 1 → and is elsewhere (since we know it's present).

So we can get more information.

So either ABOUT or AUDIO? Let me choose AUDIO because it includes D and I, which are common letters? 

But also, ABOUT has B and T? Which are common.

I think both are fine. Let me pick ""AUDIO"".

Therefore, second guess: ""AUDIO""

Response format: <guess>audio</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with -). So A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the second guess:
- Avoid using C, R, N, E.
- Include A in a position other than 3 to gather new positioning clues.
- Favor common letters not yet tested (B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Choose a word with distinct letters to maximize coverage.

""AUDIO"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A (in position 1, avoiding position 3) and new common letters U, D, I, O.
- Uses only distinct letters and avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).

This guess will provide feedback on A's position and test four new letters.",Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(-) D(-) I(x) O(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,squad,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) - not in the word
R(x) - not in the word
A(-) - in the word but wrong position
N(x) - not in the word
E(x) - not in the word

So from this feedback we know:
- The letter ""A"" is present in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was at position 3, which is index 2, and we got '-', meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Now, since ""A"" is in the word but not in the third position, it must be in one of the other four positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E (because they are not in the secret word)
- Includes the letter ""A"" but not in the third position (to avoid getting the same feedback for A, and to test other positions)
- Preferably includes other common letters to get more feedback.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test A in a different position and cover more common consonants.

Since A is the only known letter, we should consider words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Also, trying more vowels might be useful. We haven't tried O, I, U yet.

A common strategy is to use a word with A and another vowel, and some common consonants.

Possible choices: 
- Place A at position 1: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ADOPT"", ""AGLOW"" - but note we must avoid C, R, N, E.
- Place A at position 2: e.g., ""SALAD"" (but S is common) - but SALAD has duplicate A? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know yet, but feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess twice. So we can use words with duplicates if necessary, but maybe avoid for now to test more letters.

Let's brainstorm words without C,R,N,E and with A in a new position.

Example: 
- A at position 1: ""ABHOR"", ""ADAPT"", ""ALIGN"", ""ALOFT"", ""AMPLY"", ""AWASH"", ""AXIOM"", ""ABOUT"" -> but ABOUT has U and O and B, T. However, U and O are vowels we haven't tried.

But ADAPT has D and P and T, but also A and P? We must avoid duplicate letters? Actually, in our guess we can have duplicates? But the feedback will tell us if the secret word has duplicates. However, since we know A is only once in the feedback? The feedback shows one A as '-', meaning there is at least one A. But it could be more? So we might try a word with one A to avoid confusion.

But ADAPT has two As? Actually, no: A-D-A-P-T? Wait, ADAPT: positions 1:A, 2:D, 3:A, 4:P, 5:T -> but position 3 is A. We must avoid A at position 3 because we know it's not there? Actually, we are allowed to put A at position 3 again? But if the secret word has only one A, then if we put A at position 3 again, and it's wrong, we get 'x' for that A. But currently we know that A is in the word and not at position 3. So if we put A at a different position, we can see if it's at that position.

But note: if the secret word has two A's, then we might get '-', even at position 3? But we already know that at position 3 we got '-' meaning that the A was in the word but not at that location? Actually, no: the feedback we got was for the first occurrence of A? Wait, no: the feedback is per position.

In ""crane"", the A was at position 3 (starting index 1: C1, R2, A3, N4, E5). We got A3 as '-', meaning that there is an A in the word, but not at position 3. That doesn't tell us about duplicate A's.

If the secret word has two A's and one of them is at position 3? Then we would have gotten a '✓' for position 3? But we didn't, so position 3 cannot be A. But there might be another A at another position.

So we should not put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. We'll try a different position.

Therefore, for the next guess, we try a word with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Since we also want to maximize coverage of new letters, I propose using a word with A in the first position.

Consider ""AUDIO"". This has A (position 1) and U,D,I,O. But note: we have only used one A, and it tests four new letters (U,D,I,O) and we know A is one letter. However, ""AUDIO"" has vowels mostly. Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" has A? No, ABOUT is O at position 1? Wait, ABOUT: O,B,O,U,T? No: A-B-O-U-T? That has A at position 1? Actually, ABOUT: A at position 1? Wait, no. ABOUT: the letters are A, B, O, U, T? In order: position 1: A, 2: B, 3: O, 4: U, 5: T? Yes! So ABOUT has A at position 1.

But does ABOUT contain forbidden letters? We must avoid C,R,N,E. ABOUT has: A,B,O,U,T. None of C,R,N,E. So it's okay.

But ""AUDIO"" similarly: A,U,D,I,O -> no forbidden letters.

Alternatively, ""ALOFT"": A,L,O,F,T -> also good.

Another option: ""STAMP"" has S,T,A,M,P. A is at position 3? Wait, STAMP: S,T,A,M,P -> A is at position 3? We don't want to put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. So we avoid that.

We need a word that puts A either at 1,2,4,5.

Let me consider:

- Position 1: about, audio, adapt (but adapt has A at 1 and 3? and we don't want A at 3 -> so avoid using A at 3 again if possible). Note: adapt has two A's: A-D-A-P-T -> so positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:A, 4:P, 5:T. So we have A at 3 again. We might get this one wrong again? We already know position 3 isn't A? So we don't want to use a word that has A at position 3. Therefore, we avoid words with A at position 3.

So we choose a word without A in position 3.

Therefore, ABOUT: A1, B2, O3, U4, T5 -> no A at 3.
AUDIO: A1, U2, D3, I4, O5 -> also no A at 3.

Alternatively, SALAD: S1, A2, L3, A4, D5 -> but we have an A at position 2 and 4? And position 3 is L. But SALAD has duplicate A? We don't know if the secret word has duplicate A. It might confuse? Better to avoid duplicate letters to test more letters? So preferably, we choose a word without duplicates for now.

Both ABOUT and AUDIO have unique letters: ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> all distinct? Yes. AUDIO: A,U,D,I,O -> distinct.

ALOFT: A,L,O,F,T -> distinct, and A at position 1? Wait, ALOFT: A1, L2, O3, F4, T5 -> yes.

But ""ALOFT"" and ""ABOUT"" both have A at position 1. Which one?

Since we also have more vowels to try, AUDIO tests U, I, O? That's three vowels? Maybe too many vowels? But consonants are also important.

Another word: ""TABLE"": but we must avoid E -> we can't use E because we know it's not in the word. So TABLE is not allowed.

""MANLY"": M,A,N, but N is forbidden (we got N as x in ""crane""), so must avoid N.

""SHARP"": S,H,A,R, but R is forbidden because we got R(x) -> not in the word? So R is absent. Must avoid R.

Similarly, we must avoid C,R,N,E.

So about the words: 

- AUDIO: A,U,D,I,O -> forbidden letters? None. Also distinct letters.

- ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct, no forbidden.

- ALOFT: A,L,O,F,T -> distinct, no forbidden.

Which one is better? AUDIO has U and D and I and O? AUDIO tests a lot of vowels? We need to cover consonants too? Maybe?

But we don't have a strong preference? Another word: ""STALK"" -> A at position 4? Position 4: STALK: S,T,A,L,K -> A is at position 3? Wait: S1,T2,A3,L4,K5? A at position 3 -> we don't want that.

Another: ""PLAIN"" -> has N? No, we can't use N.

""QUAKE"" -> has E? Forbidden.

""WHARF"" -> has R? Forbidden.

So let's stick with AUDIO or ABOUT.

Alternatively, ""BAWDY"": B,A,W,D,Y -> A at position 2? BAWDY: B1,A2,W3,D4,Y5 -> A not at position 3? Position 2? So that would test A at a new position.

Similarly, we might want to test A at position 4? Words like: TESTA? A at position 5? But TESTA has E? Forbidden.

So let's try to pick a word with A in a position other than 3 and avoid forbidden letters.

Given the above, I think AUDIO is a good choice because:
- It tests five distinct letters including three vowels (U,I,O) and two consonants (A,D? Wait, A is vowel, D is consonant). Actually: A (vowel), U (vowel), D (consonant), I (vowel), O (vowel). So four vowels? But we already have A known? We are testing A at position 1? If we get a '✓', then we know A is at position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not at 1? Already we know it's in, so the '-' for A would not tell us new about presence? But it would tell us position 1 is wrong? So then we know A must be at position 2,4, or 5? 

But if we test A at position 1 and get 'x', that would be confusing? Because we know A is in the word? Actually, we would not get 'x' for A? We should get either '✓' if it's at position 1 or '-' if it's not at position 1 but present? Yes.

Similarly for position 2? But we are putting A only at position 1.

Therefore, either:

- A gets '✓': then position 1 is A → and we can build on that.

- A gets '-': then we know A is not at position 1 → and is elsewhere (since we know it's present).

So we can get more information.

So either ABOUT or AUDIO? Let me choose AUDIO because it includes D and I, which are common letters? 

But also, ABOUT has B and T? Which are common.

I think both are fine. Let me pick ""AUDIO"".

Therefore, second guess: ""AUDIO""

Response format: <guess>audio</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with -). So A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the second guess:
- Avoid using C, R, N, E.
- Include A in a position other than 3 to gather new positioning clues.
- Favor common letters not yet tested (B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Choose a word with distinct letters to maximize coverage.

""AUDIO"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A (in position 1, avoiding position 3) and new common letters U, D, I, O.
- Uses only distinct letters and avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).

This guess will provide feedback on A's position and test four new letters.

- A(-): A is in word but not in position 3 (since in ""crane"" A was at position 3)
- N(x): N not in word
- E(x): E not in word

**Feedback from Guess 2: audio**
- A(-): A is in word, but not in position 1 (since in ""audio"" A was position 1)
- U(-): U is in word, but not in position 2
- D(-): D is in word, but not in position 3
- I(x): I not in word
- O(x): O not in word

**What We Know So Far:**
1. **Letters NOT in the word**: C, R, N, E, I, O (from both feedbacks: marked with x)
2. **Letters in the word but position uncertain**: A, U, D
   - A is in word, not at position 1 or 3.
   - U is in word, not at position 2.
   - D is in word, not at position 3.

**Possible Positions for Known Letters:**
Since the word has 5 letters:
- Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- For A: Cannot be position 1 or 3 → must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- For U: Cannot be position 2 → must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- For D: Cannot be position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also know that the word must contain exactly these three known letters: A, U, D, and possibly two more which are unknown (but not C,R,N,E,I,O).

**Unknown Letters:**
The remaining letters of the alphabet are: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We must guess a word that:
- Contains A, U, D.
- Does not contain C,R,N,E,I,O or any other letters marked absent.
- Places A not at position 1 or 3, U not at position 2, D not at position 3.

**Refinement:**
We have three known correct letters: A, U, D. Therefore, the secret word must have exactly these three, or possibly duplicates? But no duplicates indicated yet? For example, we don't know if there are multiple A's, U's, or D's. However, the feedback has shown no duplicates so far? But we cannot rule out duplicates.

In ""crane"": one A, marked '-', meaning at least one A exists.
In ""audio"": one A (at pos 1) marked '-', meaning A is not at 1 but exists (same as before). Also one U and one D.

If there were duplicates, we might have gotten multiple occurrences? But so far we only have one of each indicated? Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicates? No, if a letter appears twice in the guess and the word has duplicates, it can show accordingly. For example, if the word has double A, and we guess one A in the correct position and one wrong, we could see a ✓ and a -.

But in our case, we only guessed one A in each word? So we don't know? It's safe to assume one of each unless we see evidence? But we must be cautious.

But for simplicity, let's try to form a word with distinct A, U, D and two new letters? But duplicates are possible? We'll aim for distinct to cover more letters.

So, we need to pick a word with A, U, D and two other letters from the allowed set.

**Possible Words:**
We must place A at positions 2, 4, or 5; U at 1,3,4,5; D at 1,2,4,5.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Examples:
- If we place A at position 2: Then word form: _ A ? ? ?
- With U and D somewhere: possibilities like U A D ? ? (if U at 1, D at 3) → but D cannot be at position 3? D is forbidden at position 3? D not at position 3, so D cannot be at pos 3.

Similarly, U cannot be at position 2? So position 2 is occupied by A? Yes.

Similarly, D cannot be at position 3.

Other combinations?

Let me brainstorm words that contain A,U,D and avoid forbidden letters.

Common words:

- DAUB? But DAUB has only 4 letters? We need 5-letter words.
- DAUBS: 5 letters? But DAUBS has S. But let's consider positions: DAUBS -> D at1, A at2, U at3, B at4, S at5.

Now, check constraints:
- A at position 2: allowed (since A cannot be at 1 or 3 → 2 is allowed).
- U at position 3: allowed (since U cannot be at 2 → 3 is allowed? D U not at position 2 → yes, U at position 3 is fine).
- D at position 1: allowed (D not forbidden at position 1 → only not at position 3).
- Also, note: S and B are not forbidden? Yes.

But the word is ""DAUBS""? Is it valid? Daubs means multiple daub? Yes, it is a word.

But we don't know about positions? We'll test.

Another word: GAUDY? GAUDY: G,A,U,D,Y → positions: G1, A2, U3, D4, Y5.

Constraints for A: position 2 → allowed? Yes (A cannot be at 1 or 3 → 2 is allowed).
U at position 3: allowed? U cannot be at position 2 → yes, position 3 is allowed? D U, we have no restriction for U at position 3? Yes.
D at position 4: allowed? Yes (not at position 3 → 4 is fine).
No forbidden letters? Yes.

But GAUDY uses G and Y? Which we haven't tested.

Another possible word: WAULD? But WAULD is not a standard word? Unlikely.

Another: FLUID? But has F, L, U, I, D? But I is forbidden? (Got I(x) in guess 2). So cannot use I.

SOUND? But S,O,U,N,D → O is forbidden? O(x) → no.

WADED? Has duplicate D? And E → E is forbidden? E(x) → no.

ADULT? ADULT: A,D,U,L,T → positions: A1, D2, U3, L4, T5.

Constraints:
- A at position 1: but earlier feedback said A(-) for position 1 → so A cannot be at position 1? We got A(-) in ""audio"" meaning A is in the word but not at position 1? So A cannot be at position 1? Correct. Therefore, ADULT has A at position 1 → not allowed? Because we know A is not at position 1? So we must avoid placing A at position 1? Yes.

Therefore, ADULT is invalid for this constraint? We need A at positions 2,4, or 5? Not 1.

Thus, DAUBS and GAUDY are candidates.

Let me list more:
- SAPID: has I? Forbidden? I(x) → yes? Also, A at position 2: S,A,P,I,D -> I is forbidden → no.

- SPALD: not a word.

Do we have words with A at position 5? For example: GONAD? But G,O,N,A,D → O is forbidden? O(x), N(x) → no.

Or HYDRA: but R? forbidden? R(x) → no.

Therefore, fewer options? We need words with A,U,D and two other allowed letters?

Perhaps with A at position 4? Example: WORDY? But O is forbidden? And W,O,R,D,Y → R forbidden → no.

Also, A at position 4: e.g., GUARD? G,U,A,R,D → R forbidden → no.

SHUDA: not standard.

Another try: DAUB (4 letters) not useful.

So let's consider DAUBS and GAUDY? Also, DAUNT: has N? N forbidden →? N(x) → no.

WAIFS: doesn't have U,D? We require U and D.

So DAUBS and GAUDY seem good? But DAUBS: D at position 1, A at 2, U at 3, B at 4, S at 5.

GAUDY: G at 1, A at 2, U at3, D at4, Y at5.

We should choose one that maximizes information? Since we also need to test other common letters? Both words test two new consonants: DAUBS: B and S; GAUDY: G and Y.

Perhaps B and S are more common than G and Y? So DAUBS might be better? Or GAUDY? But both seem fine.

Another option: MAUDS? MAUDS: M at1, A at2, U at3, D at4, S at5? Or MAUDY? MAUDY: similar to GAUDY? M A U D Y.

Yes, MAUDY: M1,A2,U3,D4,Y5.

Similarly, BAULK? But has L? Position: B1,A2,U3,L4,K5? And A at2, U at3, D is not? Baulk doesn't have D? Oh, we need D? Must contain D.

So MAUDY or MAUDS? MAUDS: M A U D S? Yes.

Now, we have three candidates: DAUBS, GAUDY, MAUDY? MAUDY uses M and Y? Similarly GAUDY uses G and Y.

DAUBS: D at position1? But D is known to be present? We don't have a constraint against D at position1? Only that it cannot be at positions position3? So placement for D: positions except position3? So position1 is allowed? Similarly, for A: position2 is allowed? For U: position3 is allowed? So DAUBS: positions for D1 is fine? Yes.

However, we must note: if D is at position1, is that possible? Based on previous feedback, D cannot be at position3? But position1 is okay? Similarly, for GAUDY, D at position4? Also okay.

But let's evaluate? We also have information from the - symbols? Not just presence? We have no constraint for positions? We are testing.

But we must avoid positions we know are wrong? For example, A cannot be at positions 1 and 3? U cannot be at position2? D cannot be at position3? So DAUBS: D at position1 (okay), A at position2 (okay), U at position3 (okay)? And positions? Yes.

Similarly for GAUDY: G at1? We have no restriction for first letter? Okay.

But we also know that A is at position2? We don't? We only know A cannot be at positions 1 or 3? But it could be at positions 2,4 or5? So in GAUDY, A is at position2? That's possible? Similarly, in DAUBS at position2? Both have A at position2? Which is one of the possibilities? So okay.

Now, which word to choose? Let's see if the word must logically be one of them? But we don't know? We just guess? So I'll choose DAUBS? But DAUBS has D at position1? And U at position3? We don't know U's position? It might not be at position3? So if we guess DAUBS and U is not at position3, we get U(-)? Similarly, D at position1 might not be correct? So we might get two '-'? And we get positions? Well, it's informative.

But GAUDY similarly has U at position3? Same issue? Perhaps we should try to choose a word where we test different positions? For example, try to place U at positions not 2 and not position3? We have no restriction? And similarly A? So let me think? Are words where A is at position4 or5?

For example: words like PUDAS? Not standard?

Or AUDIO → we already tried? Cannot.

Another word: DOUMA? But O? forbidden → no.

Perhaps QUADS? Q is difficult? Also, QUADS: Q1,U2,A3,D4,S5 → but A cannot be at position3? Because we had A(-) at position3? Wait, yes? We know A cannot be at position3? So QUADS has A at position3? Forbidden? Cannot use? So invalid.

Therefore, really, our options are words with A at position2? or at position4 or5? But we don't have many options for A at position4 or5? Without using forbidden letters?

For example: SQUAD? S,Q,U,A,D → positions: S1,Q2,U3,A4,D5 → A at position4? Which is allowed? And U at position3? But U cannot be at position2? Position3 is allowed? Also, Q is a letter? Is Q allowed? We don't know? But QU is common? Also, SQUAD does not contain forbidden letters? Let's see: SQUAD: S,Q,U,A,D → S? Not forbidden? Q? Not tested? U? present? A? present? D? present? Also, A at position4? Both U and D positions? U at position3? D at position5? Okay? And SQUAD is valid word? Yes.

Similarly, we can consider SQUAD? Or GUANO? GUANO: G,U,A,N,O → N and O forbidden → no.

Or PUDGY? P,U,D,G,Y → positions: P1,U2,D3,G4,Y5? But U is at position2? But feedback said U(-) at position2? Meaning U cannot be at position2? So we cannot use U at position2? Therefore, SQUAD: U is at position3? Not position2? Allowed? Also, D at position5? Not position3? Allowed? A at position4? Allowed? So SQUAD is a valid option.

So possible words: DAUBS, GAUDY, SQUAD? Etc.

Now, comparing:
- DAUBS: letters: D,A,U,B,S
- GAUDY: G,A,U,D,Y
- SQUAD: S,Q,U,A,D

In DAUBS and SQUAD, both have S? But SQUAD has Q? Q is less common? Also, SQUAD might not be ideal because of the Q? It might narrow down? Whereas B and S are common? So DAUBS might be better? But Q is possible? Perhaps SQUAD is also a good word.

But in DAUBS: positions: D1 A2 U3 B4 S5? The U is at position3? What if U is not at position3? Then we get U(-) meaning U is in the word but not at that position? Similarly, D at position1? If not at position1, get D(-)? But if U is at position3, we get U(✓)? So it tells us? Good.

Similarly for SQUAD: S1, Q2, U3, A4, D5? Positions? We'll test U at position3? Etc.

Also, we didn't test T? T is a common letter? We haven't tested? But DAUBS doesn't have T? Neither SQUAD? But GAUDY? Has G,Y? Also no T? But we only got three letters among many? So not a problem? We can test later.

Perhaps we choose DAUBS to avoid Q? Since Q is low frequency? Also, DAUBS is a common word? Or GAUDY? Both are acceptable? But DAUBS uses B and S? Which are common? So let's pick DAUBS.

But wait: GAUDY: G,A,U,D,Y? Also fine? But note: if DAUBS is the word? We don't know? But we are guessing? So DAUBS seems safer? Alternatively, we might try to use a word with T? Must include A,U,D? And T? Examples: AUDIT? But AUDIT: A,U,D,I,T → I is forbidden? I(x) → cannot.

ABOUT? We tried already? Not allowed? O forbidden? Actually, ABOUT has O? Which is forbidden? O(x) → no.

ADULT? Earlier we discarded because A cannot be at position1? And ADULT has A at position1? But indeed cannot? So no.

HAULD? Not standard? So again no? Therefore, no word with T? So go with DAUBS or GAUDY.

I think DAUBS is a good option? Or even ""WADED""? But WADED has E? E forbidden → no.

Another: ""BADLY""? But has Y? And no U,D? Must have U and D? So requires both U and D.

I think DAUBS or SQUAD? But since SQUAD has Q? Let's pick DAUBS? No, SQUAD is common and acceptable? Actually, SQUAD is a common word? And Q might be present? Not a problem? But because Q is rare? Perhaps DAUBS is better? 

But GAUDY and DAUBS are both non-Q? So choose DAUBS: <guess>daubs</guess>? 

Wait: from feedback? We have no constraints? But in AUDIO we got D(-) at position3? So D cannot be at position3? In DAUBS? D is at position1? Which is okay? So no issue.

Another word: FLUDS? Not a word? Or CLADS? Not? So DAUBS is acceptable? Let's confirm? DAUBS is a valid English word: plural of daub? Meaning to paint or coat? Yes.

Similarly, MAUDS? Plural of maud? Acceptable? But I think DAUBS is better known? 

Perhaps ""CAULD""? But C forbidden? And 5 letters? Cauld? Not? 

Therefore, I go with ""DAUBS"".

However, we must consider: if the secret word has duplicates? For example, suppose the word is AUDIO? But already guessed? Not the case? Or something else? But DAUBS doesn't have duplicates? So okay.

So guess: DAUBS.

Let me write: <guess>daubs</guess>

But let's double-check the constraints? In DAUBS:

Position 1: D? D cannot be at position3? Position1 is ok→ position1 unknown? Feedback may be ✓ or - for position1? Depends on secret word? Similarly, position2: A → if secret word has A at position2, we get ✓? Else, -? Etc.

Also, letters: DAUBS has no forbidden letters? Only D,A,U,B,S? And C,R,N,E,I,O are forbidden? So none of those? Yes.

Therefore, it's valid.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is in the secret word but not in position 3. C, R, N, and E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (audio)**: A is in the word but not in position 1. U and D are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3, respectively. I and O are not in the word.

**Key Deductions:**
1. **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, I, O are not in the secret word.
2. **Present Letters**: A, U, and D are in the word.
3. **Position Constraints**:
   - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
   - U cannot be in position 2 → must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
   - D cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
4. The secret word contains exactly 5 letters, including A, U, D, and two unknown letters (from the remaining alphabet: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z). No duplicates have been indicated, but they cannot be ruled out entirely.

**Strategy for Next Guess:**
- The guess must include A, U, and D to verify their positions.
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, E, I, O) to prevent redundant testing.
- Maximize information by using common consonants and distinct letters to cover new possibilities.
- With A, U, and D occupying three positions, the guess should test two new letters from the untested set (e.g., B, S, G, T).
- Given A's position constraints (2, 4, 5), choose a word placing A in one of these to resolve ambiguity—preferably position 2 for early testing.

**Selected Guess: ""DAUBS""**
- **Positions**: D (position 1), A (position 2), U (position 3), B (position 4), S (position 5).  
- **Validity**: 
  - Satisfies constraints: A at position 2 (allowed), U at position 3 (allowed, since U can't be at 2), D at position 1 (allowed, since D can't be at 3).
  - Uses common letters B and S (untested).
  - No absent letters and ensures distinct letters for maximum coverage.
- If incorrect, feedback on D/A/U (positions 1/2/3) and new letters B/S will narrow down possibilities significantly.

<guess>daubs</guess>",daubs,"We have feedback from two guesses.

**Feedback from Guess 1: crane**
- C(x): C not in word
- R(x): R not in word
- A(-): A is in word but not in position 3 (since in ""crane"" A was at position 3)
- N(x): N not in word
- E(x): E not in word

**Feedback from Guess 2: audio**
- A(-): A is in word, but not in position 1 (since in ""audio"" A was position 1)
- U(-): U is in word, but not in position 2
- D(-): D is in word, but not in position 3
- I(x): I not in word
- O(x): O not in word

**What We Know So Far:**
1. **Letters NOT in the word**: C, R, N, E, I, O (from both feedbacks: marked with x)
2. **Letters in the word but position uncertain**: A, U, D
   - A is in word, not at position 1 or 3.
   - U is in word, not at position 2.
   - D is in word, not at position 3.

**Possible Positions for Known Letters:**
Since the word has 5 letters:
- Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- For A: Cannot be position 1 or 3 → must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- For U: Cannot be position 2 → must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- For D: Cannot be position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also know that the word must contain exactly these three known letters: A, U, D, and possibly two more which are unknown (but not C,R,N,E,I,O).

**Unknown Letters:**
The remaining letters of the alphabet are: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We must guess a word that:
- Contains A, U, D.
- Does not contain C,R,N,E,I,O or any other letters marked absent.
- Places A not at position 1 or 3, U not at position 2, D not at position 3.

**Refinement:**
We have three known correct letters: A, U, D. Therefore, the secret word must have exactly these three, or possibly duplicates? But no duplicates indicated yet? For example, we don't know if there are multiple A's, U's, or D's. However, the feedback has shown no duplicates so far? But we cannot rule out duplicates.

In ""crane"": one A, marked '-', meaning at least one A exists.
In ""audio"": one A (at pos 1) marked '-', meaning A is not at 1 but exists (same as before). Also one U and one D.

If there were duplicates, we might have gotten multiple occurrences? But so far we only have one of each indicated? Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicates? No, if a letter appears twice in the guess and the word has duplicates, it can show accordingly. For example, if the word has double A, and we guess one A in the correct position and one wrong, we could see a ✓ and a -.

But in our case, we only guessed one A in each word? So we don't know? It's safe to assume one of each unless we see evidence? But we must be cautious.

But for simplicity, let's try to form a word with distinct A, U, D and two new letters? But duplicates are possible? We'll aim for distinct to cover more letters.

So, we need to pick a word with A, U, D and two other letters from the allowed set.

**Possible Words:**
We must place A at positions 2, 4, or 5; U at 1,3,4,5; D at 1,2,4,5.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Examples:
- If we place A at position 2: Then word form: _ A ? ? ?
- With U and D somewhere: possibilities like U A D ? ? (if U at 1, D at 3) → but D cannot be at position 3? D is forbidden at position 3? D not at position 3, so D cannot be at pos 3.

Similarly, U cannot be at position 2? So position 2 is occupied by A? Yes.

Similarly, D cannot be at position 3.

Other combinations?

Let me brainstorm words that contain A,U,D and avoid forbidden letters.

Common words:

- DAUB? But DAUB has only 4 letters? We need 5-letter words.
- DAUBS: 5 letters? But DAUBS has S. But let's consider positions: DAUBS -> D at1, A at2, U at3, B at4, S at5.

Now, check constraints:
- A at position 2: allowed (since A cannot be at 1 or 3 → 2 is allowed).
- U at position 3: allowed (since U cannot be at 2 → 3 is allowed? D U not at position 2 → yes, U at position 3 is fine).
- D at position 1: allowed (D not forbidden at position 1 → only not at position 3).
- Also, note: S and B are not forbidden? Yes.

But the word is ""DAUBS""? Is it valid? Daubs means multiple daub? Yes, it is a word.

But we don't know about positions? We'll test.

Another word: GAUDY? GAUDY: G,A,U,D,Y → positions: G1, A2, U3, D4, Y5.

Constraints for A: position 2 → allowed? Yes (A cannot be at 1 or 3 → 2 is allowed).
U at position 3: allowed? U cannot be at position 2 → yes, position 3 is allowed? D U, we have no restriction for U at position 3? Yes.
D at position 4: allowed? Yes (not at position 3 → 4 is fine).
No forbidden letters? Yes.

But GAUDY uses G and Y? Which we haven't tested.

Another possible word: WAULD? But WAULD is not a standard word? Unlikely.

Another: FLUID? But has F, L, U, I, D? But I is forbidden? (Got I(x) in guess 2). So cannot use I.

SOUND? But S,O,U,N,D → O is forbidden? O(x) → no.

WADED? Has duplicate D? And E → E is forbidden? E(x) → no.

ADULT? ADULT: A,D,U,L,T → positions: A1, D2, U3, L4, T5.

Constraints:
- A at position 1: but earlier feedback said A(-) for position 1 → so A cannot be at position 1? We got A(-) in ""audio"" meaning A is in the word but not at position 1? So A cannot be at position 1? Correct. Therefore, ADULT has A at position 1 → not allowed? Because we know A is not at position 1? So we must avoid placing A at position 1? Yes.

Therefore, ADULT is invalid for this constraint? We need A at positions 2,4, or 5? Not 1.

Thus, DAUBS and GAUDY are candidates.

Let me list more:
- SAPID: has I? Forbidden? I(x) → yes? Also, A at position 2: S,A,P,I,D -> I is forbidden → no.

- SPALD: not a word.

Do we have words with A at position 5? For example: GONAD? But G,O,N,A,D → O is forbidden? O(x), N(x) → no.

Or HYDRA: but R? forbidden? R(x) → no.

Therefore, fewer options? We need words with A,U,D and two other allowed letters?

Perhaps with A at position 4? Example: WORDY? But O is forbidden? And W,O,R,D,Y → R forbidden → no.

Also, A at position 4: e.g., GUARD? G,U,A,R,D → R forbidden → no.

SHUDA: not standard.

Another try: DAUB (4 letters) not useful.

So let's consider DAUBS and GAUDY? Also, DAUNT: has N? N forbidden →? N(x) → no.

WAIFS: doesn't have U,D? We require U and D.

So DAUBS and GAUDY seem good? But DAUBS: D at position 1, A at 2, U at 3, B at 4, S at 5.

GAUDY: G at 1, A at 2, U at3, D at4, Y at5.

We should choose one that maximizes information? Since we also need to test other common letters? Both words test two new consonants: DAUBS: B and S; GAUDY: G and Y.

Perhaps B and S are more common than G and Y? So DAUBS might be better? Or GAUDY? But both seem fine.

Another option: MAUDS? MAUDS: M at1, A at2, U at3, D at4, S at5? Or MAUDY? MAUDY: similar to GAUDY? M A U D Y.

Yes, MAUDY: M1,A2,U3,D4,Y5.

Similarly, BAULK? But has L? Position: B1,A2,U3,L4,K5? And A at2, U at3, D is not? Baulk doesn't have D? Oh, we need D? Must contain D.

So MAUDY or MAUDS? MAUDS: M A U D S? Yes.

Now, we have three candidates: DAUBS, GAUDY, MAUDY? MAUDY uses M and Y? Similarly GAUDY uses G and Y.

DAUBS: D at position1? But D is known to be present? We don't have a constraint against D at position1? Only that it cannot be at positions position3? So placement for D: positions except position3? So position1 is allowed? Similarly, for A: position2 is allowed? For U: position3 is allowed? So DAUBS: positions for D1 is fine? Yes.

However, we must note: if D is at position1, is that possible? Based on previous feedback, D cannot be at position3? But position1 is okay? Similarly, for GAUDY, D at position4? Also okay.

But let's evaluate? We also have information from the - symbols? Not just presence? We have no constraint for positions? We are testing.

But we must avoid positions we know are wrong? For example, A cannot be at positions 1 and 3? U cannot be at position2? D cannot be at position3? So DAUBS: D at position1 (okay), A at position2 (okay), U at position3 (okay)? And positions? Yes.

Similarly for GAUDY: G at1? We have no restriction for first letter? Okay.

But we also know that A is at position2? We don't? We only know A cannot be at positions 1 or 3? But it could be at positions 2,4 or5? So in GAUDY, A is at position2? That's possible? Similarly, in DAUBS at position2? Both have A at position2? Which is one of the possibilities? So okay.

Now, which word to choose? Let's see if the word must logically be one of them? But we don't know? We just guess? So I'll choose DAUBS? But DAUBS has D at position1? And U at position3? We don't know U's position? It might not be at position3? So if we guess DAUBS and U is not at position3, we get U(-)? Similarly, D at position1 might not be correct? So we might get two '-'? And we get positions? Well, it's informative.

But GAUDY similarly has U at position3? Same issue? Perhaps we should try to choose a word where we test different positions? For example, try to place U at positions not 2 and not position3? We have no restriction? And similarly A? So let me think? Are words where A is at position4 or5?

For example: words like PUDAS? Not standard?

Or AUDIO → we already tried? Cannot.

Another word: DOUMA? But O? forbidden → no.

Perhaps QUADS? Q is difficult? Also, QUADS: Q1,U2,A3,D4,S5 → but A cannot be at position3? Because we had A(-) at position3? Wait, yes? We know A cannot be at position3? So QUADS has A at position3? Forbidden? Cannot use? So invalid.

Therefore, really, our options are words with A at position2? or at position4 or5? But we don't have many options for A at position4 or5? Without using forbidden letters?

For example: SQUAD? S,Q,U,A,D → positions: S1,Q2,U3,A4,D5 → A at position4? Which is allowed? And U at position3? But U cannot be at position2? Position3 is allowed? Also, Q is a letter? Is Q allowed? We don't know? But QU is common? Also, SQUAD does not contain forbidden letters? Let's see: SQUAD: S,Q,U,A,D → S? Not forbidden? Q? Not tested? U? present? A? present? D? present? Also, A at position4? Both U and D positions? U at position3? D at position5? Okay? And SQUAD is valid word? Yes.

Similarly, we can consider SQUAD? Or GUANO? GUANO: G,U,A,N,O → N and O forbidden → no.

Or PUDGY? P,U,D,G,Y → positions: P1,U2,D3,G4,Y5? But U is at position2? But feedback said U(-) at position2? Meaning U cannot be at position2? So we cannot use U at position2? Therefore, SQUAD: U is at position3? Not position2? Allowed? Also, D at position5? Not position3? Allowed? A at position4? Allowed? So SQUAD is a valid option.

So possible words: DAUBS, GAUDY, SQUAD? Etc.

Now, comparing:
- DAUBS: letters: D,A,U,B,S
- GAUDY: G,A,U,D,Y
- SQUAD: S,Q,U,A,D

In DAUBS and SQUAD, both have S? But SQUAD has Q? Q is less common? Also, SQUAD might not be ideal because of the Q? It might narrow down? Whereas B and S are common? So DAUBS might be better? But Q is possible? Perhaps SQUAD is also a good word.

But in DAUBS: positions: D1 A2 U3 B4 S5? The U is at position3? What if U is not at position3? Then we get U(-) meaning U is in the word but not at that position? Similarly, D at position1? If not at position1, get D(-)? But if U is at position3, we get U(✓)? So it tells us? Good.

Similarly for SQUAD: S1, Q2, U3, A4, D5? Positions? We'll test U at position3? Etc.

Also, we didn't test T? T is a common letter? We haven't tested? But DAUBS doesn't have T? Neither SQUAD? But GAUDY? Has G,Y? Also no T? But we only got three letters among many? So not a problem? We can test later.

Perhaps we choose DAUBS to avoid Q? Since Q is low frequency? Also, DAUBS is a common word? Or GAUDY? Both are acceptable? But DAUBS uses B and S? Which are common? So let's pick DAUBS.

But wait: GAUDY: G,A,U,D,Y? Also fine? But note: if DAUBS is the word? We don't know? But we are guessing? So DAUBS seems safer? Alternatively, we might try to use a word with T? Must include A,U,D? And T? Examples: AUDIT? But AUDIT: A,U,D,I,T → I is forbidden? I(x) → cannot.

ABOUT? We tried already? Not allowed? O forbidden? Actually, ABOUT has O? Which is forbidden? O(x) → no.

ADULT? Earlier we discarded because A cannot be at position1? And ADULT has A at position1? But indeed cannot? So no.

HAULD? Not standard? So again no? Therefore, no word with T? So go with DAUBS or GAUDY.

I think DAUBS is a good option? Or even ""WADED""? But WADED has E? E forbidden → no.

Another: ""BADLY""? But has Y? And no U,D? Must have U and D? So requires both U and D.

I think DAUBS or SQUAD? But since SQUAD has Q? Let's pick DAUBS? No, SQUAD is common and acceptable? Actually, SQUAD is a common word? And Q might be present? Not a problem? But because Q is rare? Perhaps DAUBS is better? 

But GAUDY and DAUBS are both non-Q? So choose DAUBS: <guess>daubs</guess>? 

Wait: from feedback? We have no constraints? But in AUDIO we got D(-) at position3? So D cannot be at position3? In DAUBS? D is at position1? Which is okay? So no issue.

Another word: FLUDS? Not a word? Or CLADS? Not? So DAUBS is acceptable? Let's confirm? DAUBS is a valid English word: plural of daub? Meaning to paint or coat? Yes.

Similarly, MAUDS? Plural of maud? Acceptable? But I think DAUBS is better known? 

Perhaps ""CAULD""? But C forbidden? And 5 letters? Cauld? Not? 

Therefore, I go with ""DAUBS"".

However, we must consider: if the secret word has duplicates? For example, suppose the word is AUDIO? But already guessed? Not the case? Or something else? But DAUBS doesn't have duplicates? So okay.

So guess: DAUBS.

Let me write: <guess>daubs</guess>

But let's double-check the constraints? In DAUBS:

Position 1: D? D cannot be at position3? Position1 is ok→ position1 unknown? Feedback may be ✓ or - for position1? Depends on secret word? Similarly, position2: A → if secret word has A at position2, we get ✓? Else, -? Etc.

Also, letters: DAUBS has no forbidden letters? Only D,A,U,B,S? And C,R,N,E,I,O are forbidden? So none of those? Yes.

Therefore, it's valid.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is in the secret word but not in position 3. C, R, N, and E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (audio)**: A is in the word but not in position 1. U and D are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3, respectively. I and O are not in the word.

**Key Deductions:**
1. **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, I, O are not in the secret word.
2. **Present Letters**: A, U, and D are in the word.
3. **Position Constraints**:
   - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
   - U cannot be in position 2 → must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
   - D cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
4. The secret word contains exactly 5 letters, including A, U, D, and two unknown letters (from the remaining alphabet: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z). No duplicates have been indicated, but they cannot be ruled out entirely.

**Strategy for Next Guess:**
- The guess must include A, U, and D to verify their positions.
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, E, I, O) to prevent redundant testing.
- Maximize information by using common consonants and distinct letters to cover new possibilities.
- With A, U, and D occupying three positions, the guess should test two new letters from the untested set (e.g., B, S, G, T).
- Given A's position constraints (2, 4, 5), choose a word placing A in one of these to resolve ambiguity—preferably position 2 for early testing.

**Selected Guess: ""DAUBS""**
- **Positions**: D (position 1), A (position 2), U (position 3), B (position 4), S (position 5).  
- **Validity**: 
  - Satisfies constraints: A at position 2 (allowed), U at position 3 (allowed, since U can't be at 2), D at position 1 (allowed, since D can't be at 3).
  - Uses common letters B and S (untested).
  - No absent letters and ensures distinct letters for maximum coverage.
- If incorrect, feedback on D/A/U (positions 1/2/3) and new letters B/S will narrow down possibilities significantly.",Guess 3: daubs -> FEEDBACK: D(-) A(-) U(✓) B(x) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,squad,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) - not in the word
R(x) - not in the word
A(-) - in the word but wrong position
N(x) - not in the word
E(x) - not in the word

So from this feedback we know:
- The letter ""A"" is present in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was at position 3, which is index 2, and we got '-', meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Now, since ""A"" is in the word but not in the third position, it must be in one of the other four positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, E (because they are not in the secret word)
- Includes the letter ""A"" but not in the third position (to avoid getting the same feedback for A, and to test other positions)
- Preferably includes other common letters to get more feedback.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test A in a different position and cover more common consonants.

Since A is the only known letter, we should consider words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Also, trying more vowels might be useful. We haven't tried O, I, U yet.

A common strategy is to use a word with A and another vowel, and some common consonants.

Possible choices: 
- Place A at position 1: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ADOPT"", ""AGLOW"" - but note we must avoid C, R, N, E.
- Place A at position 2: e.g., ""SALAD"" (but S is common) - but SALAD has duplicate A? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know yet, but feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess twice. So we can use words with duplicates if necessary, but maybe avoid for now to test more letters.

Let's brainstorm words without C,R,N,E and with A in a new position.

Example: 
- A at position 1: ""ABHOR"", ""ADAPT"", ""ALIGN"", ""ALOFT"", ""AMPLY"", ""AWASH"", ""AXIOM"", ""ABOUT"" -> but ABOUT has U and O and B, T. However, U and O are vowels we haven't tried.

But ADAPT has D and P and T, but also A and P? We must avoid duplicate letters? Actually, in our guess we can have duplicates? But the feedback will tell us if the secret word has duplicates. However, since we know A is only once in the feedback? The feedback shows one A as '-', meaning there is at least one A. But it could be more? So we might try a word with one A to avoid confusion.

But ADAPT has two As? Actually, no: A-D-A-P-T? Wait, ADAPT: positions 1:A, 2:D, 3:A, 4:P, 5:T -> but position 3 is A. We must avoid A at position 3 because we know it's not there? Actually, we are allowed to put A at position 3 again? But if the secret word has only one A, then if we put A at position 3 again, and it's wrong, we get 'x' for that A. But currently we know that A is in the word and not at position 3. So if we put A at a different position, we can see if it's at that position.

But note: if the secret word has two A's, then we might get '-', even at position 3? But we already know that at position 3 we got '-' meaning that the A was in the word but not at that location? Actually, no: the feedback we got was for the first occurrence of A? Wait, no: the feedback is per position.

In ""crane"", the A was at position 3 (starting index 1: C1, R2, A3, N4, E5). We got A3 as '-', meaning that there is an A in the word, but not at position 3. That doesn't tell us about duplicate A's.

If the secret word has two A's and one of them is at position 3? Then we would have gotten a '✓' for position 3? But we didn't, so position 3 cannot be A. But there might be another A at another position.

So we should not put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. We'll try a different position.

Therefore, for the next guess, we try a word with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Since we also want to maximize coverage of new letters, I propose using a word with A in the first position.

Consider ""AUDIO"". This has A (position 1) and U,D,I,O. But note: we have only used one A, and it tests four new letters (U,D,I,O) and we know A is one letter. However, ""AUDIO"" has vowels mostly. Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" has A? No, ABOUT is O at position 1? Wait, ABOUT: O,B,O,U,T? No: A-B-O-U-T? That has A at position 1? Actually, ABOUT: A at position 1? Wait, no. ABOUT: the letters are A, B, O, U, T? In order: position 1: A, 2: B, 3: O, 4: U, 5: T? Yes! So ABOUT has A at position 1.

But does ABOUT contain forbidden letters? We must avoid C,R,N,E. ABOUT has: A,B,O,U,T. None of C,R,N,E. So it's okay.

But ""AUDIO"" similarly: A,U,D,I,O -> no forbidden letters.

Alternatively, ""ALOFT"": A,L,O,F,T -> also good.

Another option: ""STAMP"" has S,T,A,M,P. A is at position 3? Wait, STAMP: S,T,A,M,P -> A is at position 3? We don't want to put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. So we avoid that.

We need a word that puts A either at 1,2,4,5.

Let me consider:

- Position 1: about, audio, adapt (but adapt has A at 1 and 3? and we don't want A at 3 -> so avoid using A at 3 again if possible). Note: adapt has two A's: A-D-A-P-T -> so positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:A, 4:P, 5:T. So we have A at 3 again. We might get this one wrong again? We already know position 3 isn't A? So we don't want to use a word that has A at position 3. Therefore, we avoid words with A at position 3.

So we choose a word without A in position 3.

Therefore, ABOUT: A1, B2, O3, U4, T5 -> no A at 3.
AUDIO: A1, U2, D3, I4, O5 -> also no A at 3.

Alternatively, SALAD: S1, A2, L3, A4, D5 -> but we have an A at position 2 and 4? And position 3 is L. But SALAD has duplicate A? We don't know if the secret word has duplicate A. It might confuse? Better to avoid duplicate letters to test more letters? So preferably, we choose a word without duplicates for now.

Both ABOUT and AUDIO have unique letters: ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> all distinct? Yes. AUDIO: A,U,D,I,O -> distinct.

ALOFT: A,L,O,F,T -> distinct, and A at position 1? Wait, ALOFT: A1, L2, O3, F4, T5 -> yes.

But ""ALOFT"" and ""ABOUT"" both have A at position 1. Which one?

Since we also have more vowels to try, AUDIO tests U, I, O? That's three vowels? Maybe too many vowels? But consonants are also important.

Another word: ""TABLE"": but we must avoid E -> we can't use E because we know it's not in the word. So TABLE is not allowed.

""MANLY"": M,A,N, but N is forbidden (we got N as x in ""crane""), so must avoid N.

""SHARP"": S,H,A,R, but R is forbidden because we got R(x) -> not in the word? So R is absent. Must avoid R.

Similarly, we must avoid C,R,N,E.

So about the words: 

- AUDIO: A,U,D,I,O -> forbidden letters? None. Also distinct letters.

- ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct, no forbidden.

- ALOFT: A,L,O,F,T -> distinct, no forbidden.

Which one is better? AUDIO has U and D and I and O? AUDIO tests a lot of vowels? We need to cover consonants too? Maybe?

But we don't have a strong preference? Another word: ""STALK"" -> A at position 4? Position 4: STALK: S,T,A,L,K -> A is at position 3? Wait: S1,T2,A3,L4,K5? A at position 3 -> we don't want that.

Another: ""PLAIN"" -> has N? No, we can't use N.

""QUAKE"" -> has E? Forbidden.

""WHARF"" -> has R? Forbidden.

So let's stick with AUDIO or ABOUT.

Alternatively, ""BAWDY"": B,A,W,D,Y -> A at position 2? BAWDY: B1,A2,W3,D4,Y5 -> A not at position 3? Position 2? So that would test A at a new position.

Similarly, we might want to test A at position 4? Words like: TESTA? A at position 5? But TESTA has E? Forbidden.

So let's try to pick a word with A in a position other than 3 and avoid forbidden letters.

Given the above, I think AUDIO is a good choice because:
- It tests five distinct letters including three vowels (U,I,O) and two consonants (A,D? Wait, A is vowel, D is consonant). Actually: A (vowel), U (vowel), D (consonant), I (vowel), O (vowel). So four vowels? But we already have A known? We are testing A at position 1? If we get a '✓', then we know A is at position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not at 1? Already we know it's in, so the '-' for A would not tell us new about presence? But it would tell us position 1 is wrong? So then we know A must be at position 2,4, or 5? 

But if we test A at position 1 and get 'x', that would be confusing? Because we know A is in the word? Actually, we would not get 'x' for A? We should get either '✓' if it's at position 1 or '-' if it's not at position 1 but present? Yes.

Similarly for position 2? But we are putting A only at position 1.

Therefore, either:

- A gets '✓': then position 1 is A → and we can build on that.

- A gets '-': then we know A is not at position 1 → and is elsewhere (since we know it's present).

So we can get more information.

So either ABOUT or AUDIO? Let me choose AUDIO because it includes D and I, which are common letters? 

But also, ABOUT has B and T? Which are common.

I think both are fine. Let me pick ""AUDIO"".

Therefore, second guess: ""AUDIO""

Response format: <guess>audio</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with -). So A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the second guess:
- Avoid using C, R, N, E.
- Include A in a position other than 3 to gather new positioning clues.
- Favor common letters not yet tested (B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Choose a word with distinct letters to maximize coverage.

""AUDIO"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A (in position 1, avoiding position 3) and new common letters U, D, I, O.
- Uses only distinct letters and avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).

This guess will provide feedback on A's position and test four new letters.

<guess>audio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(-) D(-) I(x) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses.

**Feedback from Guess 1: crane**
- C(x): C not in word
- R(x): R not in word
- A(-): A is in word but not in position 3 (since in ""crane"" A was at position 3)
- N(x): N not in word
- E(x): E not in word

**Feedback from Guess 2: audio**
- A(-): A is in word, but not in position 1 (since in ""audio"" A was position 1)
- U(-): U is in word, but not in position 2
- D(-): D is in word, but not in position 3
- I(x): I not in word
- O(x): O not in word

**What We Know So Far:**
1. **Letters NOT in the word**: C, R, N, E, I, O (from both feedbacks: marked with x)
2. **Letters in the word but position uncertain**: A, U, D
   - A is in word, not at position 1 or 3.
   - U is in word, not at position 2.
   - D is in word, not at position 3.

**Possible Positions for Known Letters:**
Since the word has 5 letters:
- Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- For A: Cannot be position 1 or 3 → must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- For U: Cannot be position 2 → must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- For D: Cannot be position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also know that the word must contain exactly these three known letters: A, U, D, and possibly two more which are unknown (but not C,R,N,E,I,O).

**Unknown Letters:**
The remaining letters of the alphabet are: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We must guess a word that:
- Contains A, U, D.
- Does not contain C,R,N,E,I,O or any other letters marked absent.
- Places A not at position 1 or 3, U not at position 2, D not at position 3.

**Refinement:**
We have three known correct letters: A, U, D. Therefore, the secret word must have exactly these three, or possibly duplicates? But no duplicates indicated yet? For example, we don't know if there are multiple A's, U's, or D's. However, the feedback has shown no duplicates so far? But we cannot rule out duplicates.

In ""crane"": one A, marked '-', meaning at least one A exists.
In ""audio"": one A (at pos 1) marked '-', meaning A is not at 1 but exists (same as before). Also one U and one D.

If there were duplicates, we might have gotten multiple occurrences? But so far we only have one of each indicated? Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicates? No, if a letter appears twice in the guess and the word has duplicates, it can show accordingly. For example, if the word has double A, and we guess one A in the correct position and one wrong, we could see a ✓ and a -.

But in our case, we only guessed one A in each word? So we don't know? It's safe to assume one of each unless we see evidence? But we must be cautious.

But for simplicity, let's try to form a word with distinct A, U, D and two new letters? But duplicates are possible? We'll aim for distinct to cover more letters.

So, we need to pick a word with A, U, D and two other letters from the allowed set.

**Possible Words:**
We must place A at positions 2, 4, or 5; U at 1,3,4,5; D at 1,2,4,5.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Examples:
- If we place A at position 2: Then word form: _ A ? ? ?
- With U and D somewhere: possibilities like U A D ? ? (if U at 1, D at 3) → but D cannot be at position 3? D is forbidden at position 3? D not at position 3, so D cannot be at pos 3.

Similarly, U cannot be at position 2? So position 2 is occupied by A? Yes.

Similarly, D cannot be at position 3.

Other combinations?

Let me brainstorm words that contain A,U,D and avoid forbidden letters.

Common words:

- DAUB? But DAUB has only 4 letters? We need 5-letter words.
- DAUBS: 5 letters? But DAUBS has S. But let's consider positions: DAUBS -> D at1, A at2, U at3, B at4, S at5.

Now, check constraints:
- A at position 2: allowed (since A cannot be at 1 or 3 → 2 is allowed).
- U at position 3: allowed (since U cannot be at 2 → 3 is allowed? D U not at position 2 → yes, U at position 3 is fine).
- D at position 1: allowed (D not forbidden at position 1 → only not at position 3).
- Also, note: S and B are not forbidden? Yes.

But the word is ""DAUBS""? Is it valid? Daubs means multiple daub? Yes, it is a word.

But we don't know about positions? We'll test.

Another word: GAUDY? GAUDY: G,A,U,D,Y → positions: G1, A2, U3, D4, Y5.

Constraints for A: position 2 → allowed? Yes (A cannot be at 1 or 3 → 2 is allowed).
U at position 3: allowed? U cannot be at position 2 → yes, position 3 is allowed? D U, we have no restriction for U at position 3? Yes.
D at position 4: allowed? Yes (not at position 3 → 4 is fine).
No forbidden letters? Yes.

But GAUDY uses G and Y? Which we haven't tested.

Another possible word: WAULD? But WAULD is not a standard word? Unlikely.

Another: FLUID? But has F, L, U, I, D? But I is forbidden? (Got I(x) in guess 2). So cannot use I.

SOUND? But S,O,U,N,D → O is forbidden? O(x) → no.

WADED? Has duplicate D? And E → E is forbidden? E(x) → no.

ADULT? ADULT: A,D,U,L,T → positions: A1, D2, U3, L4, T5.

Constraints:
- A at position 1: but earlier feedback said A(-) for position 1 → so A cannot be at position 1? We got A(-) in ""audio"" meaning A is in the word but not at position 1? So A cannot be at position 1? Correct. Therefore, ADULT has A at position 1 → not allowed? Because we know A is not at position 1? So we must avoid placing A at position 1? Yes.

Therefore, ADULT is invalid for this constraint? We need A at positions 2,4, or 5? Not 1.

Thus, DAUBS and GAUDY are candidates.

Let me list more:
- SAPID: has I? Forbidden? I(x) → yes? Also, A at position 2: S,A,P,I,D -> I is forbidden → no.

- SPALD: not a word.

Do we have words with A at position 5? For example: GONAD? But G,O,N,A,D → O is forbidden? O(x), N(x) → no.

Or HYDRA: but R? forbidden? R(x) → no.

Therefore, fewer options? We need words with A,U,D and two other allowed letters?

Perhaps with A at position 4? Example: WORDY? But O is forbidden? And W,O,R,D,Y → R forbidden → no.

Also, A at position 4: e.g., GUARD? G,U,A,R,D → R forbidden → no.

SHUDA: not standard.

Another try: DAUB (4 letters) not useful.

So let's consider DAUBS and GAUDY? Also, DAUNT: has N? N forbidden →? N(x) → no.

WAIFS: doesn't have U,D? We require U and D.

So DAUBS and GAUDY seem good? But DAUBS: D at position 1, A at 2, U at 3, B at 4, S at 5.

GAUDY: G at 1, A at 2, U at3, D at4, Y at5.

We should choose one that maximizes information? Since we also need to test other common letters? Both words test two new consonants: DAUBS: B and S; GAUDY: G and Y.

Perhaps B and S are more common than G and Y? So DAUBS might be better? Or GAUDY? But both seem fine.

Another option: MAUDS? MAUDS: M at1, A at2, U at3, D at4, S at5? Or MAUDY? MAUDY: similar to GAUDY? M A U D Y.

Yes, MAUDY: M1,A2,U3,D4,Y5.

Similarly, BAULK? But has L? Position: B1,A2,U3,L4,K5? And A at2, U at3, D is not? Baulk doesn't have D? Oh, we need D? Must contain D.

So MAUDY or MAUDS? MAUDS: M A U D S? Yes.

Now, we have three candidates: DAUBS, GAUDY, MAUDY? MAUDY uses M and Y? Similarly GAUDY uses G and Y.

DAUBS: D at position1? But D is known to be present? We don't have a constraint against D at position1? Only that it cannot be at positions position3? So placement for D: positions except position3? So position1 is allowed? Similarly, for A: position2 is allowed? For U: position3 is allowed? So DAUBS: positions for D1 is fine? Yes.

However, we must note: if D is at position1, is that possible? Based on previous feedback, D cannot be at position3? But position1 is okay? Similarly, for GAUDY, D at position4? Also okay.

But let's evaluate? We also have information from the - symbols? Not just presence? We have no constraint for positions? We are testing.

But we must avoid positions we know are wrong? For example, A cannot be at positions 1 and 3? U cannot be at position2? D cannot be at position3? So DAUBS: D at position1 (okay), A at position2 (okay), U at position3 (okay)? And positions? Yes.

Similarly for GAUDY: G at1? We have no restriction for first letter? Okay.

But we also know that A is at position2? We don't? We only know A cannot be at positions 1 or 3? But it could be at positions 2,4 or5? So in GAUDY, A is at position2? That's possible? Similarly, in DAUBS at position2? Both have A at position2? Which is one of the possibilities? So okay.

Now, which word to choose? Let's see if the word must logically be one of them? But we don't know? We just guess? So I'll choose DAUBS? But DAUBS has D at position1? And U at position3? We don't know U's position? It might not be at position3? So if we guess DAUBS and U is not at position3, we get U(-)? Similarly, D at position1 might not be correct? So we might get two '-'? And we get positions? Well, it's informative.

But GAUDY similarly has U at position3? Same issue? Perhaps we should try to choose a word where we test different positions? For example, try to place U at positions not 2 and not position3? We have no restriction? And similarly A? So let me think? Are words where A is at position4 or5?

For example: words like PUDAS? Not standard?

Or AUDIO → we already tried? Cannot.

Another word: DOUMA? But O? forbidden → no.

Perhaps QUADS? Q is difficult? Also, QUADS: Q1,U2,A3,D4,S5 → but A cannot be at position3? Because we had A(-) at position3? Wait, yes? We know A cannot be at position3? So QUADS has A at position3? Forbidden? Cannot use? So invalid.

Therefore, really, our options are words with A at position2? or at position4 or5? But we don't have many options for A at position4 or5? Without using forbidden letters?

For example: SQUAD? S,Q,U,A,D → positions: S1,Q2,U3,A4,D5 → A at position4? Which is allowed? And U at position3? But U cannot be at position2? Position3 is allowed? Also, Q is a letter? Is Q allowed? We don't know? But QU is common? Also, SQUAD does not contain forbidden letters? Let's see: SQUAD: S,Q,U,A,D → S? Not forbidden? Q? Not tested? U? present? A? present? D? present? Also, A at position4? Both U and D positions? U at position3? D at position5? Okay? And SQUAD is valid word? Yes.

Similarly, we can consider SQUAD? Or GUANO? GUANO: G,U,A,N,O → N and O forbidden → no.

Or PUDGY? P,U,D,G,Y → positions: P1,U2,D3,G4,Y5? But U is at position2? But feedback said U(-) at position2? Meaning U cannot be at position2? So we cannot use U at position2? Therefore, SQUAD: U is at position3? Not position2? Allowed? Also, D at position5? Not position3? Allowed? A at position4? Allowed? So SQUAD is a valid option.

So possible words: DAUBS, GAUDY, SQUAD? Etc.

Now, comparing:
- DAUBS: letters: D,A,U,B,S
- GAUDY: G,A,U,D,Y
- SQUAD: S,Q,U,A,D

In DAUBS and SQUAD, both have S? But SQUAD has Q? Q is less common? Also, SQUAD might not be ideal because of the Q? It might narrow down? Whereas B and S are common? So DAUBS might be better? But Q is possible? Perhaps SQUAD is also a good word.

But in DAUBS: positions: D1 A2 U3 B4 S5? The U is at position3? What if U is not at position3? Then we get U(-) meaning U is in the word but not at that position? Similarly, D at position1? If not at position1, get D(-)? But if U is at position3, we get U(✓)? So it tells us? Good.

Similarly for SQUAD: S1, Q2, U3, A4, D5? Positions? We'll test U at position3? Etc.

Also, we didn't test T? T is a common letter? We haven't tested? But DAUBS doesn't have T? Neither SQUAD? But GAUDY? Has G,Y? Also no T? But we only got three letters among many? So not a problem? We can test later.

Perhaps we choose DAUBS to avoid Q? Since Q is low frequency? Also, DAUBS is a common word? Or GAUDY? Both are acceptable? But DAUBS uses B and S? Which are common? So let's pick DAUBS.

But wait: GAUDY: G,A,U,D,Y? Also fine? But note: if DAUBS is the word? We don't know? But we are guessing? So DAUBS seems safer? Alternatively, we might try to use a word with T? Must include A,U,D? And T? Examples: AUDIT? But AUDIT: A,U,D,I,T → I is forbidden? I(x) → cannot.

ABOUT? We tried already? Not allowed? O forbidden? Actually, ABOUT has O? Which is forbidden? O(x) → no.

ADULT? Earlier we discarded because A cannot be at position1? And ADULT has A at position1? But indeed cannot? So no.

HAULD? Not standard? So again no? Therefore, no word with T? So go with DAUBS or GAUDY.

I think DAUBS is a good option? Or even ""WADED""? But WADED has E? E forbidden → no.

Another: ""BADLY""? But has Y? And no U,D? Must have U and D? So requires both U and D.

I think DAUBS or SQUAD? But since SQUAD has Q? Let's pick DAUBS? No, SQUAD is common and acceptable? Actually, SQUAD is a common word? And Q might be present? Not a problem? But because Q is rare? Perhaps DAUBS is better? 

But GAUDY and DAUBS are both non-Q? So choose DAUBS: <guess>daubs</guess>? 

Wait: from feedback? We have no constraints? But in AUDIO we got D(-) at position3? So D cannot be at position3? In DAUBS? D is at position1? Which is okay? So no issue.

Another word: FLUDS? Not a word? Or CLADS? Not? So DAUBS is acceptable? Let's confirm? DAUBS is a valid English word: plural of daub? Meaning to paint or coat? Yes.

Similarly, MAUDS? Plural of maud? Acceptable? But I think DAUBS is better known? 

Perhaps ""CAULD""? But C forbidden? And 5 letters? Cauld? Not? 

Therefore, I go with ""DAUBS"".

However, we must consider: if the secret word has duplicates? For example, suppose the word is AUDIO? But already guessed? Not the case? Or something else? But DAUBS doesn't have duplicates? So okay.

So guess: DAUBS.

Let me write: <guess>daubs</guess>

But let's double-check the constraints? In DAUBS:

Position 1: D? D cannot be at position3? Position1 is ok→ position1 unknown? Feedback may be ✓ or - for position1? Depends on secret word? Similarly, position2: A → if secret word has A at position2, we get ✓? Else, -? Etc.

Also, letters: DAUBS has no forbidden letters? Only D,A,U,B,S? And C,R,N,E,I,O are forbidden? So none of those? Yes.

Therefore, it's valid.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is in the secret word but not in position 3. C, R, N, and E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (audio)**: A is in the word but not in position 1. U and D are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3, respectively. I and O are not in the word.

**Key Deductions:**
1. **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, I, O are not in the secret word.
2. **Present Letters**: A, U, and D are in the word.
3. **Position Constraints**:
   - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
   - U cannot be in position 2 → must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
   - D cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
4. The secret word contains exactly 5 letters, including A, U, D, and two unknown letters (from the remaining alphabet: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z). No duplicates have been indicated, but they cannot be ruled out entirely.

**Strategy for Next Guess:**
- The guess must include A, U, and D to verify their positions.
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, E, I, O) to prevent redundant testing.
- Maximize information by using common consonants and distinct letters to cover new possibilities.
- With A, U, and D occupying three positions, the guess should test two new letters from the untested set (e.g., B, S, G, T).
- Given A's position constraints (2, 4, 5), choose a word placing A in one of these to resolve ambiguity—preferably position 2 for early testing.

**Selected Guess: ""DAUBS""**
- **Positions**: D (position 1), A (position 2), U (position 3), B (position 4), S (position 5).  
- **Validity**: 
  - Satisfies constraints: A at position 2 (allowed), U at position 3 (allowed, since U can't be at 2), D at position 1 (allowed, since D can't be at 3).
  - Uses common letters B and S (untested).
  - No absent letters and ensures distinct letters for maximum coverage.
- If incorrect, feedback on D/A/U (positions 1/2/3) and new letters B/S will narrow down possibilities significantly.

We should choose a word that:\n- Does not contain C, R, N, E (because they are not in the secret word)\n- Includes the letter ""A"" but not in the third position (to avoid getting the same feedback for A, and to test other positions)\n- Preferably includes other common letters to get more feedback.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to test A in a different position and cover more common consonants.\n\nSince A is the only known letter, we should consider words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nAlso, trying more vowels might be useful. We haven\'t tried O, I, U yet.\n\nA common strategy is to use a word with A and another vowel, and some common consonants.\n\nPossible choices: \n- Place A at position 1: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ADOPT"", ""AGLOW"" - but note we must avoid C, R, N, E.\n- Place A at position 2: e.g., ""SALAD"" (but S is common) - but SALAD has duplicate A? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know yet, but feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess twice. So we can use words with duplicates if necessary, but maybe avoid for now to test more letters.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm words without C,R,N,E and with A in a new position.\n\nExample: \n- A at position 1: ""ABHOR"", ""ADAPT"", ""ALIGN"", ""ALOFT"", ""AMPLY"", ""AWASH"", ""AXIOM"", ""ABOUT"" -> but ABOUT has U and O and B, T. However, U and O are vowels we haven\'t tried.\n\nBut ADAPT has D and P and T, but also A and P? We must avoid duplicate letters? Actually, in our guess we can have duplicates? But the feedback will tell us if the secret word has duplicates. However, since we know A is only once in the feedback? The feedback shows one A as \'-\', meaning there is at least one A. But it could be more? So we might try a word with one A to avoid confusion.\n\nBut ADAPT has two As? Actually, no: A-D-A-P-T? Wait, ADAPT: positions 1:A, 2:D, 3:A, 4:P, 5:T -> but position 3 is A. We must avoid A at position 3 because we know it\'s not there? Actually, we are allowed to put A at position 3 again? But if the secret word has only one A, then if we put A at position 3 again, and it\'s wrong, we get \'x\' for that A. But currently we know that A is in the word and not at position 3. So if we put A at a different position, we can see if it\'s at that position.\n\nBut note: if the secret word has two A\'s, then we might get \'-\', even at position 3? But we already know that at position 3 we got \'-\' meaning that the A was in the word but not at that location? Actually, no: the feedback we got was for the first occurrence of A? Wait, no: the feedback is per position.\n\nIn ""crane"", the A was at position 3 (starting index 1: C1, R2, A3, N4, E5). We got A3 as \'-\', meaning that there is an A in the word, but not at position 3. That doesn\'t tell us about duplicate A\'s.\n\nIf the secret word has two A\'s and one of them is at position 3? Then we would have gotten a \'✓\' for position 3? But we didn\'t, so position 3 cannot be A. But there might be another A at another position.\n\nSo we should not put A at position 3 again because we know it\'s not there. We\'ll try a different position.\n\nTherefore, for the next guess, we try a word with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nSince we also want to maximize coverage of new letters, I propose using a word with A in the first position.\n\nConsider ""AUDIO"". This has A (position 1) and U,D,I,O. But note: we have only used one A, and it tests four new letters (U,D,I,O) and we know A is one letter. However, ""AUDIO"" has vowels mostly. Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" has A? No, ABOUT is O at position 1? Wait, ABOUT: O,B,O,U,T? No: A-B-O-U-T? That has A at position 1? Actually, ABOUT: A at position 1? Wait, no. ABOUT: the letters are A, B, O, U, T? In order: position 1: A, 2: B, 3: O, 4: U, 5: T? Yes! So ABOUT has A at position 1.\n\nBut does ABOUT contain forbidden letters? We must avoid C,R,N,E. ABOUT has: A,B,O,U,T. None of C,R,N,E. So it\'s okay.\n\nBut ""AUDIO"" similarly: A,U,D,I,O -> no forbidden letters.\n\nAlternatively, ""ALOFT"": A,L,O,F,T -> also good.\n\nAnother option: ""STAMP"" has S,T,A,M,P. A is at position 3? Wait, STAMP: S,T,A,M,P -> A is at position 3? We don\'t want to put A at position 3 again because we know it\'s not there. So we avoid that.\n\nWe need a word that puts A either at 1,2,4,5.\n\nLet me consider:\n\n- Position 1: about, audio, adapt (but adapt has A at 1 and 3? and we don\'t want A at 3 -> so avoid using A at 3 again if possible). Note: adapt has two A\'s: A-D-A-P-T -> so positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:A, 4:P, 5:T. So we have A at 3 again. We might get this one wrong again? We already know position 3 isn\'t A? So we don\'t want to use a word that has A at position 3. Therefore, we avoid words with A at position 3.\n\nSo we choose a word without A in position 3.\n\nTherefore, ABOUT: A1, B2, O3, U4, T5 -> no A at 3.\nAUDIO: A1, U2, D3, I4, O5 -> also no A at 3.\n\nAlternatively, SALAD: S1, A2, L3, A4, D5 -> but we have an A at position 2 and 4? And position 3 is L. But SALAD has duplicate A? We don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate A. It might confuse? Better to avoid duplicate letters to test more letters? So preferably, we choose a word without duplicates for now.\n\nBoth ABOUT and AUDIO have unique letters: ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> all distinct? Yes. AUDIO: A,U,D,I,O -> distinct.\n\nALOFT: A,L,O,F,T -> distinct, and A at position 1? Wait, ALOFT: A1, L2, O3, F4, T5 -> yes.\n\nBut ""ALOFT"" and ""ABOUT"" both have A at position 1. Which one?\n\nSince we also have more vowels to try, AUDIO tests U, I, O? That\'s three vowels? Maybe too many vowels? But consonants are also important.\n\nAnother word: ""TABLE"": but we must avoid E -> we can\'t use E because we know it\'s not in the word. So TABLE is not allowed.\n\n""MANLY"": M,A,N, but N is forbidden (we got N as x in ""crane""), so must avoid N.\n\n""SHARP"": S,H,A,R, but R is forbidden because we got R(x) -> not in the word? So R is absent. Must avoid R.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid C,R,N,E.\n\nSo about the words: \n\n- AUDIO: A,U,D,I,O -> forbidden letters? None. Also distinct letters.\n\n- ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct, no forbidden.\n\n- ALOFT: A,L,O,F,T -> distinct, no forbidden.\n\nWhich one is better? AUDIO has U and D and I and O? AUDIO tests a lot of vowels? We need to cover consonants too? Maybe?\n\nBut we don\'t have a strong preference? Another word: ""STALK"" -> A at position 4? Position 4: STALK: S,T,A,L,K -> A is at position 3? Wait: S1,T2,A3,L4,K5? A at position 3 -> we don\'t want that.\n\nAnother: ""PLAIN"" -> has N? No, we can\'t use N.\n\n""QUAKE"" -> has E? Forbidden.\n\n""WHARF"" -> has R? Forbidden.\n\nSo let\'s stick with AUDIO or ABOUT.\n\nAlternatively, ""BAWDY"": B,A,W,D,Y -> A at position 2? BAWDY: B1,A2,W3,D4,Y5 -> A not at position 3? Position 2? So that would test A at a new position.\n\nSimilarly, we might want to test A at position 4? Words like: TESTA? A at position 5? But TESTA has E? Forbidden.\n\nSo let\'s try to pick a word with A in a position other than 3 and avoid forbidden letters.\n\nGiven the above, I think AUDIO is a good choice because:\n- It tests five distinct letters including three vowels (U,I,O) and two consonants (A,D? Wait, A is vowel, D is consonant). Actually: A (vowel), U (vowel), D (consonant), I (vowel), O (vowel). So four vowels? But we already have A known? We are testing A at position 1? If we get a \'✓\', then we know A is at position 1. If we get a \'-\', then we know A is in the word but not at 1? Already we know it\'s in, so the \'-\' for A would not tell us new about presence? But it would tell us position 1 is wrong? So then we know A must be at position 2,4, or 5? \n\nBut if we test A at position 1 and get \'x\', that would be confusing? Because we know A is in the word? Actually, we would not get \'x\' for A? We should get either \'✓\' if it\'s at position 1 or \'-\' if it\'s not at position 1 but present? Yes.\n\nSimilarly for position 2? But we are putting A only at position 1.\n\nTherefore, either:\n\n- A gets \'✓\': then position 1 is A → and we can build on that.\n\n- A gets \'-\': then we know A is not at position 1 → and is elsewhere (since we know it\'s present).\n\nSo we can get more information.\n\nSo either ABOUT or AUDIO? Let me choose AUDIO because it includes D and I, which are common letters? \n\nBut also, ABOUT has B and T? Which are common.\n\nI think both are fine. Let me pick ""AUDIO"".\n\nTherefore, second guess: ""AUDIO""\n\nResponse format: <guess>audio</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).\n- A is in the secret word but not in the third position (marked with -).

Therefore, the secret word must have exactly these three, or possibly duplicates? But no duplicates indicated yet? For example, we don\'t know if there are multiple A\'s, U\'s, or D\'s. However, the feedback has shown no duplicates so far? But we cannot rule out duplicates.\n\nIn ""crane"": one A, marked \'-\', meaning at least one A exists.\nIn ""audio"": one A (at pos 1) marked \'-\', meaning A is not at 1 but exists (same as before). Also one U and one D.\n\nIf there were duplicates, we might have gotten multiple occurrences? But so far we only have one of each indicated? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates? No, if a letter appears twice in the guess and the word has duplicates, it can show accordingly. For example, if the word has double A, and we guess one A in the correct position and one wrong, we could see a ✓ and a -.\n\nBut in our case, we only guessed one A in each word? So we don\'t know? It\'s safe to assume one of each unless we see evidence? But we must be cautious.\n\nBut for simplicity, let\'s try to form a word with distinct A, U, D and two new letters? But duplicates are possible? We\'ll aim for distinct to cover more letters.\n\nSo, we need to pick a word with A, U, D and two other letters from the allowed set.\n\n**Possible Words:**\nWe must place A at positions 2, 4, or 5; U at 1,3,4,5; D at 1,2,4,5.\n\nAlso, the word must be a valid English word.\n\nExamples:\n- If we place A at position 2: Then word form: _ A ? ? ?\n- With U and D somewhere: possibilities like U A D ? ? (if U at 1, D at 3) → but D cannot be at position 3? D is forbidden at position 3? D not at position 3, so D cannot be at pos 3.\n\nSimilarly, U cannot be at position 2? So position 2 is occupied by A? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, D cannot be at position 3.\n\nOther combinations?\n\nLet me brainstorm words that contain A,U,D and avoid forbidden letters.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- DAUB? But DAUB has only 4 letters? We need 5-letter words.\n- DAUBS: 5 letters? But DAUBS has S. But let\'s consider positions: DAUBS -> D at1, A at2, U at3, B at4, S at5.\n\nNow, check constraints:\n- A at position 2: allowed (since A cannot be at 1 or 3 → 2 is allowed).\n- U at position 3: allowed (since U cannot be at 2 → 3 is allowed? D U not at position 2 → yes, U at position 3 is fine).\n- D at position 1: allowed (D not forbidden at position 1 → only not at position 3).\n- Also, note: S and B are not forbidden? Yes.\n\nBut the word is ""DAUBS""? Is it valid? Daubs means multiple daub? Yes, it is a word.\n\nBut we don\'t know about positions? We\'ll test.\n\nAnother word: GAUDY? GAUDY: G,A,U,D,Y → positions: G1, A2, U3, D4, Y5.\n\nConstraints for A: position 2 → allowed? Yes (A cannot be at 1 or 3 → 2 is allowed).\nU at position 3: allowed? U cannot be at position 2 → yes, position 3 is allowed? D U, we have no restriction for U at position 3? Yes.\nD at position 4: allowed? Yes (not at position 3 → 4 is fine).\nNo forbidden letters? Yes.\n\nBut GAUDY uses G and Y? Which we haven\'t tested.\n\nAnother possible word: WAULD? But WAULD is not a standard word? Unlikely.\n\nAnother: FLUID? But has F, L, U, I, D? But I is forbidden? (Got I(x) in guess 2). So cannot use I.\n\nSOUND? But S,O,U,N,D → O is forbidden? O(x) → no.\n\nWADED? Has duplicate D? And E → E is forbidden? E(x) → no.\n\nADULT? ADULT: A,D,U,L,T → positions: A1, D2, U3, L4, T5.\n\nConstraints:\n- A at position 1: but earlier feedback said A(-) for position 1 → so A cannot be at position 1? We got A(-) in ""audio"" meaning A is in the word but not at position 1? So A cannot be at position 1? Correct. Therefore, ADULT has A at position 1 → not allowed? Because we know A is not at position 1? So we must avoid placing A at position 1? Yes.\n\nTherefore, ADULT is invalid for this constraint? We need A at positions 2,4, or 5? Not 1.\n\nThus, DAUBS and GAUDY are candidates.\n\nLet me list more:\n- SAPID: has I? Forbidden? I(x) → yes? Also, A at position 2: S,A,P,I,D -> I is forbidden → no.\n\n- SPALD: not a word.\n\nDo we have words with A at position 5? For example: GONAD? But G,O,N,A,D → O is forbidden? O(x), N(x) → no.\n\nOr HYDRA: but R? forbidden? R(x) → no.\n\nTherefore, fewer options? We need words with A,U,D and two other allowed letters?\n\nPerhaps with A at position 4? Example: WORDY? But O is forbidden? And W,O,R,D,Y → R forbidden → no.\n\nAlso, A at position 4: e.g., GUARD? G,U,A,R,D → R forbidden → no.\n\nSHUDA: not standard.\n\nAnother try: DAUB (4 letters) not useful.\n\nSo let\'s consider DAUBS and GAUDY? Also, DAUNT: has N? N forbidden →? N(x) → no.\n\nWAIFS: doesn\'t have U,D? We require U and D.\n\nSo DAUBS and GAUDY seem good? But DAUBS: D at position 1, A at 2, U at 3, B at 4, S at 5.\n\nGAUDY: G at 1, A at 2, U at3, D at4, Y at5.\n\nWe should choose one that maximizes information? Since we also need to test other common letters? Both words test two new consonants: DAUBS: B and S; GAUDY: G and Y.\n\nPerhaps B and S are more common than G and Y? So DAUBS might be better? Or GAUDY? But both seem fine.\n\nAnother option: MAUDS? MAUDS: M at1, A at2, U at3, D at4, S at5? Or MAUDY? MAUDY: similar to GAUDY? M A U D Y.\n\nYes, MAUDY: M1,A2,U3,D4,Y5.\n\nSimilarly, BAULK? But has L? Position: B1,A2,U3,L4,K5? And A at2, U at3, D is not? Baulk doesn\'t have D? Oh, we need D? Must contain D.\n\nSo MAUDY or MAUDS? MAUDS: M A U D S? Yes.\n\nNow, we have three candidates: DAUBS, GAUDY, MAUDY? MAUDY uses M and Y? Similarly GAUDY uses G and Y.\n\nDAUBS: D at position1? But D is known to be present? We don\'t have a constraint against D at position1? Only that it cannot be at positions position3? So placement for D: positions except position3? So position1 is allowed? Similarly, for A: position2 is allowed? For U: position3 is allowed? So DAUBS: positions for D1 is fine? Yes.\n\nHowever, we must note: if D is at position1, is that possible? Based on previous feedback, D cannot be at position3? But position1 is okay? Similarly, for GAUDY, D at position4? Also okay.\n\nBut let\'s evaluate? We also have information from the - symbols? Not just presence? We have no constraint for positions? We are testing.\n\nBut we must avoid positions we know are wrong? For example, A cannot be at positions 1 and 3? U cannot be at position2? D cannot be at position3? So DAUBS: D at position1 (okay), A at position2 (okay), U at position3 (okay)? And positions? Yes.\n\nSimilarly for GAUDY: G at1? We have no restriction for first letter? Okay.\n\nBut we also know that A is at position2? We don\'t? We only know A cannot be at positions 1 or 3? But it could be at positions 2,4 or5? So in GAUDY, A is at position2? That\'s possible? Similarly, in DAUBS at position2? Both have A at position2? Which is one of the possibilities? So okay.\n\nNow, which word to choose? Let\'s see if the word must logically be one of them? But we don\'t know? We just guess? So I\'ll choose DAUBS? But DAUBS has D at position1? And U at position3? We don\'t know U\'s position? It might not be at position3? So if we guess DAUBS and U is not at position3, we get U(-)? Similarly, D at position1 might not be correct? So we might get two \'-\'? And we get positions? Well, it\'s informative.\n\nBut GAUDY similarly has U at position3? Same issue? Perhaps we should try to choose a word where we test different positions? For example, try to place U at positions not 2 and not position3? We have no restriction? And similarly A? So let me think? Are words where A is at position4 or5?\n\nFor example: words like PUDAS? Not standard?\n\nOr AUDIO → we already tried? Cannot.\n\nAnother word: DOUMA? But O? forbidden → no.\n\nPerhaps QUADS? Q is difficult? Also, QUADS: Q1,U2,A3,D4,S5 → but A cannot be at position3? Because we had A(-) at position3? Wait, yes? We know A cannot be at position3? So QUADS has A at position3? Forbidden? Cannot use? So invalid.\n\nTherefore, really, our options are words with A at position2? or at position4 or5? But we don\'t have many options for A at position4 or5? Without using forbidden letters?\n\nFor example: SQUAD? S,Q,U,A,D → positions: S1,Q2,U3,A4,D5 → A at position4? Which is allowed? And U at position3? But U cannot be at position2? Position3 is allowed? Also, Q is a letter? Is Q allowed? We don\'t know? But QU is common? Also, SQUAD does not contain forbidden letters? Let\'s see: SQUAD: S,Q,U,A,D → S? Not forbidden? Q? Not tested? U? present? A? present? D? present? Also, A at position4? Both U and D positions? U at position3? D at position5? Okay? And SQUAD is valid word? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, we can consider SQUAD? Or GUANO? GUANO: G,U,A,N,O → N and O forbidden → no.\n\nOr PUDGY? P,U,D,G,Y → positions: P1,U2,D3,G4,Y5? But U is at position2? But feedback said U(-) at position2? Meaning U cannot be at position2? So we cannot use U at position2? Therefore, SQUAD: U is at position3? Not position2? Allowed? Also, D at position5? Not position3? Allowed? A at position4? Allowed? So SQUAD is a valid option.\n\nSo possible words: DAUBS, GAUDY, SQUAD? Etc.\n\nNow, comparing:\n- DAUBS: letters: D,A,U,B,S\n- GAUDY: G,A,U,D,Y\n- SQUAD: S,Q,U,A,D\n\nIn DAUBS and SQUAD, both have S? But SQUAD has Q? Q is less common? Also, SQUAD might not be ideal because of the Q? It might narrow down? Whereas B and S are common? So DAUBS might be better? But Q is possible? Perhaps SQUAD is also a good word.\n\nBut in DAUBS: positions: D1 A2 U3 B4 S5? The U is at position3? What if U is not at position3? Then we get U(-) meaning U is in the word but not at that position? Similarly, D at position1? If not at position1, get D(-)? But if U is at position3, we get U(✓)? So it tells us? Good.\n\nSimilarly for SQUAD: S1, Q2, U3, A4, D5? Positions? We\'ll test U at position3? Etc.\n\nAlso, we didn\'t test T? T is a common letter? We haven\'t tested? But DAUBS doesn\'t have T? Neither SQUAD? But GAUDY? Has G,Y? Also no T? But we only got three letters among many? So not a problem? We can test later.\n\nPerhaps we choose DAUBS to avoid Q? Since Q is low frequency? Also, DAUBS is a common word? Or GAUDY? Both are acceptable? But DAUBS uses B and S? Which are common? So let\'s pick DAUBS.\n\nBut wait: GAUDY: G,A,U,D,Y? Also fine? But note: if DAUBS is the word? We don\'t know? But we are guessing? So DAUBS seems safer? Alternatively, we might try to use a word with T? Must include A,U,D? And T? Examples: AUDIT? But AUDIT: A,U,D,I,T → I is forbidden? I(x) → cannot.\n\nABOUT? We tried already? Not allowed? O forbidden? Actually, ABOUT has O? Which is forbidden? O(x) → no.\n\nADULT? Earlier we discarded because A cannot be at position1? And ADULT has A at position1? But indeed cannot? So no.\n\nHAULD? Not standard? So again no? Therefore, no word with T? So go with DAUBS or GAUDY.\n\nI think DAUBS is a good option? Or even ""WADED""? But WADED has E? E forbidden → no.\n\nAnother: ""BADLY""? But has Y? And no U,D? Must have U and D? So requires both U and D.\n\nI think DAUBS or SQUAD? But since SQUAD has Q? Let\'s pick DAUBS? No, SQUAD is common and acceptable? Actually, SQUAD is a common word? And Q might be present? Not a problem? But because Q is rare? Perhaps DAUBS is better? \n\nBut GAUDY and DAUBS are both non-Q? So choose DAUBS: <guess>daubs</guess>? \n\nWait: from feedback? We have no constraints? But in AUDIO we got D(-) at position3? So D cannot be at position3? In DAUBS? D is at position1? Which is okay? So no issue.\n\nAnother word: FLUDS? Not a word? Or CLADS? Not? So DAUBS is acceptable? Let\'s confirm? DAUBS is a valid English word: plural of daub? Meaning to paint or coat? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, MAUDS? Plural of maud? Acceptable? But I think DAUBS is better known? \n\nPerhaps ""CAULD""? But C forbidden? And 5 letters? Cauld? Not? \n\nTherefore, I go with ""DAUBS"".\n\nHowever, we must consider: if the secret word has duplicates? For example, suppose the word is AUDIO? But already guessed? Not the case? Or something else? But DAUBS doesn\'t have duplicates? So okay.\n\nSo guess: DAUBS.\n\nLet me write: <guess>daubs</guess>\n\nBut let\'s double-check the constraints? In DAUBS:\n\nPosition 1: D? D cannot be at position3? Position1 is ok→ position1 unknown? Feedback may be ✓ or - for position1? Depends on secret word? Similarly, position2: A → if secret word has A at position2, we get ✓? Else, -? Etc.\n\nAlso, letters: DAUBS has no forbidden letters? Only D,A,U,B,S? And C,R,N,E,I,O are forbidden? So none of those? Yes.\n\nTherefore, it\'s valid.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is in the secret word but not in position 3. C, R, N, and E are not in the word.\n- **Guess 2 (audio)**: A is in the word but not in position 1. U and D are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3, respectively. I and O are not in the word.\n\n**Key Deductions:**\n1. **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, I, O are not in the secret word.\n2. **Present Letters**: A, U, and D are in the word.\n3. **Position Constraints**:\n   - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 → must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n   - U cannot be in position 2 → must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n   - D cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n4. The secret word contains exactly 5 letters, including A, U, D, and two unknown letters (from the remaining alphabet: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z). No duplicates have been indicated, but they cannot be ruled out entirely.\n\n**Strategy for Next Guess:**\n- The guess must include A, U, and D to verify their positions.\n- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, E, I, O) to prevent redundant testing.\n- Maximize information by using common consonants and distinct letters to cover new possibilities.\n- With A, U, and D occupying three positions, the guess should test two new letters from the untested set (e.g., B, S, G, T).\n- Given A\'s position constraints (2, 4, 5), choose a word placing A in one of these to resolve ambiguity—preferably position 2 for early testing.\n\n**Selected Guess: ""DAUBS""**\n- **Positions**: D (position 1), A (position 2), U (position 3), B (position 4), S (position 5).  \n- **Validity**: \n  - Satisfies constraints: A at position 2 (allowed), U at position 3 (allowed, since U can\'t be at 2), D at position 1 (allowed, since D can\'t be at 3).\n  - Uses common letters B and S (untested).\n  - No absent letters and ensures distinct letters for maximum coverage.\n- If incorrect, feedback on D/A/U (positions 1/2/3) and new letters B/S will narrow down possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>daubs</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(-) D(-) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: daubs -> FEEDBACK: D(-) A(-) U(✓) B(x) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from three guesses:

**Guess 1: ""crane""**
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

**Guess 2: ""audio""**
- A: present, wrong position (-) → A is not at position 1 and not at position 3 (from first guess)
- U: present, wrong position (-) → U is not at position 2
- D: present, wrong position (-) → D is not at position 3
- I: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)

**Guess 3: ""daubs""**
- D: present, wrong position (-) → D is not at position 1
- A: present, wrong position (-) → A is not at position 2
- U: correct position (✓) → U is in the word and in position 3? 
  - In ""daubs"": positions are D1, A2, U3, B4, S5 → U at position 3 gets ✓ → so U is fixed at position 3 in the secret word.
- B: absent (x)
- S: present, wrong position (-) → S is in the word but not at position 5

**What We Know:**
- **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, I, O, B (from guesses)
- **Present Letters**: A, U, D, S (and U is fixed in position 3) 
- **Position Certainty**:
  - Position 3: U (correct) → confirmed by ✓ in guess 3.
- **Constraints**:
  - A: cannot be at pos 1 (from audio), pos 3 (from crane), or pos 2 (from daubs) → must be in pos 4 or 5.
  - D: cannot be at pos 3 (from audio) or pos 1 (from daubs) → must be in pos 2, 4, or 5.
  - S: is present, but not at pos 5 (from daubs) → must be in pos 1, 2, 4? Positions: 1,2,3,4,5 → pos 3 is taken by U? So positions 1,2,4? And not 5? So S can be at position 1, 2, or 4? Or possibly duplicated? But we have only one occurrence? Feedback might not show duplicates? But we got S only once? So for simplicity, S is therefore at position 1,2, or 4? But avoid position 5? And avoid position 3? Since U is at position3? And S cannot be at position3 if U is there? Unless duplicate? But U is confirmed at position3? So position3 is occupied by U? So S must be at position1,2, or4? Correct.

**Secret Word Structure:**
We know:
- Position 3 is U: fixed → [?, ?, U, ?, ?]
- Remaining positions (1,2,4,5) must include A, D, S? But the word has 5 letters? So we have 4 positions? We must have letters A, D, S and one more letter? But we have three positions? No: positions are 1,2,3,4,5 → position3 taken → remaining positions 1,2,4,5? And we have four positions? But we have three known letters: A, D, S? And one unknown? So total letters? The secret word must have: A, D, S, U? And one more letter? Because we have four letters? Known? 

But U is one → we have present letters: A, U, D, S → four? And the fifth must be from the unused letters? We have absent letters so far: C,R,N,E,I,O,B → so many letters possible: F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z? So yes, one more letter? 

Therefore, the secret word has: 
- Position 3: U (fixed)
- Positions 1, 2, 4, 5: must contain A (at position 4 or 5), D (at position 2,4,5), S (at position 1,2,4? avoiding position5 and since position3 taken) → and one additional letter? 

Now, constraints on positions: 
- A can only be at position 4 or 5.
- D can only be at position 2, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 3, which we know).
- S cannot be at position 5 → must be at position 1, 2, or 4.

But note: S could be at position4? But A and D also cannot be at position4? No, they can? 

Now, impossible to have duplicates? No? But we have no evidence of duplicates? So we consider distinct? But we have four known letters? And they are distinct? So fifth letter? Then all must be distinct? 

So we need a word: 
_ _ U _ _ 
With:
- Letter at position 4 or 5 must be A? Or one of them is A? Exactly one A? But not? We have one A? Position? Either 4 or 5? 
- Similarly, D must be at position 2,4,5? 
- S must be at position 1,2,4? 

But position? And one more letter at the remaining position? 

For example:
- If A is at position 4, then position 4 is A? Then S cannot be at 4? Since S is different? Similarly, D? 
Cases: 
1. A at position 4? 
   - Then position 4 = A? 
   - Then D must be at position 2 or 5? 
   - S must be at position 1 or 2? 
   - Position 5? Or position 1? 

2. If A at position 5? 
   - Then position 5 = A? 
   - Then D must be at position 2 or 4? 
   - S must be at position 1,2, or 4? 

Now, also S not at position5? But in case 2: A at position5? Then S cannot be at5? So position5 is A? Not S? So S must be at 1,2, or4? 

Now, possible words? We need to form with valid English words? 

For example: 

Case 1: position4 = A? Then word: ? ? U A ? 
Possible: 
- Position1: S? Then position2: ? but D must be at position2 or5? If position1=S, position2=? but D must be at 2 or5? And S cannot be at position2? Not required? Position2 can be anything? 

For example: 
- S at position1: then D at position2 or5? And position4=A? and position5 must be D or the fifth letter? 

But if D at position2: then S1 D2 U3 A4 ?5? Then position5 must be the fifth letter? And S is at1? 
Similarly, if D at position5: then S1 ?2 U3 A4 D5? 

Then the word must have? in position2? 

Also, the fifth letter? 

Similarly, case 2: position5=A? Then word: ? ? U ? A 
With D at position2 or4? And S at position1,2,4? 

Also, position4 must be the fifth letter? Or possibly D? Or S? 

Now, we need to find actual words? 

Possibilities:
For Case 1: pattern ? ? U A ? 
- S at1, D at2? So S D U A ? → word like SDUA? Not meaningful? 
- Possibly: SQUAD? But SQUAD: S1,Q2,U3,A4,D5 → this matches? But we have Q2? And note: Q is not forbidden? But in this word? 
But our pattern: if A is at position4? Yes? Then D at position5? So SQUAD? 
But let's see D position? D5: and in SQUAD, we have D at5? 
And U at3? Fixed? 
Then A at position4? But we also have S at position1? 
And Q at position2? 
Now, constraints? 
- A is at position4? → allowed? 
- D is at position5? → allowed? D can be at position5? 
- S is at position1? → allowed? 
- U at position3? correct? 
- Q? unknown? 
Also, SQUAD avoids all forbidden letters? 

But we also have the constraint from daubs: D(-) at position1? And S(-) at position5? Yes? 
In SQUAD, S is at1? So we would expect S to be checked? Feedback? And D at5? 
Moreover, SQUAD is a valid word? 

But case 2? Pattern ? ? U ? A 
For example: 
- S at1? D at2? Then S D U ? A → S D U ? A → e.g., S D U L A ? SDULA? not word? 
- Or S at4? But S cannot be at4? Or? 
If S at4? Then pattern: ?1 ?2 U3 S4 A5? 
But then D must be at position? D cannot be at4? Because position4 occupied by S? So D must be at position2? Then pattern: ?1 D2 U3 S4 A5? 
Then position1? Must be a letter? For example: GDUSA? Not word? 
Possible words? Like in the pattern: ? D U S A → words? 
Common? ""SUDSA""? Not? 
Perhaps ""DUSKY"" but O? not? and A? 
No? 

Another possibility? D at position4? Then for Case 2: position5=A? So pattern: ?1 ?2 U3 D4 A5? 
Then S must be at position1 or2? 
For example: S at1: S ? U D A → e.g., S T U D A? STUD is not? but it's part of? Not?
Or S L U D A? 
Also, not obvious? 

Therefore, SQUAD seems a good candidate? 

We already had SQUAD? Also, consider letters? S,Q,U,A,D → acceptable? 

But we haven't tested Q? 

Now? We have feedback: we got U(✓) at position3? 
And SQUAD has U at position3? 

Also, we need to check? 

But from ""daubs"" feedback? 
We also have D(-)? Not at position1? 
But SQUAD: D is at position5? So not at position1? Correct? 

S(-) not at position5? SQUAD: S is at position1? So not at position5? Correct? 

A(-) not at position2? SQUAD: A at position4? So not at position2? Correct? 

Therefore, SQUAD matches the constraints? 

But is it the word? We don't know? It fits the pattern? So we can guess? 

Perhaps there are others? But SQUAD seems valid? 

Alternatively, ""PLUSH""? But PLUSH: P,L,U,S,H? No? Position? U at3? But PLUSH: P1,L2,U3,S4,H5? 
Then A not present? But we must have A? Present? So SQUAD has A? 

Similarly, the pattern does not fit? 

Another word: ""SAUD""? 4 letters? 
""SAUED""? But E? forbidden? 

Therefore, SQUAD appears to be a possible word? 

So we can guess ""SQUAD"" ? 

But let me double-check? 

The pattern: 
Position1: S? → from daubs, S is not at position5? But it could be at position1? 
Position2: Q? 
Position3: U → fixed? 
Position4: A? → A must be at position4? Since cannot be at pos1,2,3? And 4 is the only possibility? But could be position5? As in case 2? 
Earlier I considered two cases? 

But SQUAD has A at position4? Which is allowed? 

Alternatively, if A were at position5? Then we need a word ending with A? 
For example: S? U? D? A? or something? 

Words like: ""SHUDA""? Not standard? 
""QUOTA""? But O? forbidden? 
Therefore, SQUAD becomes the only plausible option? 

And it uses Q? But we haven't excluded Q? 

So let's guess SQUAD? 

Format: <guess>squad</guess> 

Step-by-step reasoning? 

We have U confirmed at position3? So secret word: ? ? U ? ? 

A must be at position4 or5? 
D must be at position2,4,5? 
S must be at position1,2,4? With position3 taken? 

If we put S at position1? 
Then D at position2,4,5? 
But if A at position4? Then conflict at position4? Cannot be both A and D? So then if A at position4? Then D must be at position2 or5? 
Similarly, if A at position5? Then D can be at position2 or4? 

Now, if S at1? 
Case A at4: pattern S . U A . 
Then D? Must be at position2 or5? 
So S D U A . or S . U A D 

S . U A . → for example: SQUAD? S Q U A D? Here A is at position4? D at position5? 

Case A at5: pattern S . U . A 
Then D? Must be at position2 or4? 
Thus, S D U . A → e.g., S D U X A? But X might be? 
Or S . U D A → e.g., S Q U D A → SQUDA? Not a word? 

Therefore, SQUAD fits? 

And SQUAD matches the constraints: 
- U at position3? Correct? 
- A at position4? Allowed? 
- S at position1? Allowed? 
- D at position5? Allowed? 
- Q: unknown? 

Therefore, SQUAD is the guess? 

Note: Q is a letter? Possible? And SQUAD is valid? 

Alternatively? ""SWUNG""? But no A? So cannot? 

Therefore, SQUAD is a strong candidate? 

So guess SQUAD?

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: 
     - A is present but not in position 3.
     - C, R, N, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (audio)**:
     - A is present but not in position 1 (since it was position 1 in ""audio"").
     - U is present but not in position 2.
     - D is present but not in position 3.
     - I and O are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (daubs)**:
     - U is correct at position 3 (✓).
     - D is present but not in position 1.
     - A is present but not in position 2.
     - B is absent.
     - S is present but not in position 5.

2. **Deductions**:
   - **U is fixed at position 3**: Confirmed by ✓ in ""daubs"".
   - **A constraints**: Cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (feedback from ""audio"" and ""daubs""). Must be in position 4 or 5.
   - **D constraints**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (feedback from ""audio"" and ""daubs""). Must be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
   - **S constraints**: Present but not in position 5. Must be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
   - **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, I, O, B (all marked with x).
   - **Present letters**: A, D, U (confirmed), and S (from ""daubs"" feedback).
   - **Structure of secret word**:
     - Position 3 is U: fixed as [?, ?, U, ?, ?].
     - The word must include A, D, S, and U, plus one unknown letter (absent letters ruled out).
     - Positions 1, 2, 4, 5 must accommodate A, D, S, and the unknown letter.

3. **Positional Constraints**:
   - **A at position 4 or 5**: Since excluded from positions 1–3.
   - **D at position 2, 4, or 5**: Excluded from positions 1 and 3.
   - **S at position 1, 2, or 4**: Excluded from position 5 and cannot be at position 3 (occupied by U).

4. **Possible Secret Words**:
   - **SQUAD** fits perfectly:
     - Position 1: S (valid, as S could be here and not excluded).
     - Position 2: Q (unknown letter, not tested/absent).
     - Position 3: U (fixed and correct).
     - Position 4: A (satisfies position constraint for A).
     - Position 5: D (satisfies position constraint for D).
     - All letters distinct, and forbidden letters are avoided.

5. **Why SQUAD?**:
   - Tests A at position 4 and D at position 5.
   - Resolves positions for A, D, and S while introducing Q (untested letter).
   - If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject Q and refine positions for S and D.
   - SQUAD is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning a small military unit).

<guess>squad</guess>",squad,"We are given feedback from three guesses:

**Guess 1: ""crane""**
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

**Guess 2: ""audio""**
- A: present, wrong position (-) → A is not at position 1 and not at position 3 (from first guess)
- U: present, wrong position (-) → U is not at position 2
- D: present, wrong position (-) → D is not at position 3
- I: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)

**Guess 3: ""daubs""**
- D: present, wrong position (-) → D is not at position 1
- A: present, wrong position (-) → A is not at position 2
- U: correct position (✓) → U is in the word and in position 3? 
  - In ""daubs"": positions are D1, A2, U3, B4, S5 → U at position 3 gets ✓ → so U is fixed at position 3 in the secret word.
- B: absent (x)
- S: present, wrong position (-) → S is in the word but not at position 5

**What We Know:**
- **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, I, O, B (from guesses)
- **Present Letters**: A, U, D, S (and U is fixed in position 3) 
- **Position Certainty**:
  - Position 3: U (correct) → confirmed by ✓ in guess 3.
- **Constraints**:
  - A: cannot be at pos 1 (from audio), pos 3 (from crane), or pos 2 (from daubs) → must be in pos 4 or 5.
  - D: cannot be at pos 3 (from audio) or pos 1 (from daubs) → must be in pos 2, 4, or 5.
  - S: is present, but not at pos 5 (from daubs) → must be in pos 1, 2, 4? Positions: 1,2,3,4,5 → pos 3 is taken by U? So positions 1,2,4? And not 5? So S can be at position 1, 2, or 4? Or possibly duplicated? But we have only one occurrence? Feedback might not show duplicates? But we got S only once? So for simplicity, S is therefore at position 1,2, or 4? But avoid position 5? And avoid position 3? Since U is at position3? And S cannot be at position3 if U is there? Unless duplicate? But U is confirmed at position3? So position3 is occupied by U? So S must be at position1,2, or4? Correct.

**Secret Word Structure:**
We know:
- Position 3 is U: fixed → [?, ?, U, ?, ?]
- Remaining positions (1,2,4,5) must include A, D, S? But the word has 5 letters? So we have 4 positions? We must have letters A, D, S and one more letter? But we have three positions? No: positions are 1,2,3,4,5 → position3 taken → remaining positions 1,2,4,5? And we have four positions? But we have three known letters: A, D, S? And one unknown? So total letters? The secret word must have: A, D, S, U? And one more letter? Because we have four letters? Known? 

But U is one → we have present letters: A, U, D, S → four? And the fifth must be from the unused letters? We have absent letters so far: C,R,N,E,I,O,B → so many letters possible: F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z? So yes, one more letter? 

Therefore, the secret word has: 
- Position 3: U (fixed)
- Positions 1, 2, 4, 5: must contain A (at position 4 or 5), D (at position 2,4,5), S (at position 1,2,4? avoiding position5 and since position3 taken) → and one additional letter? 

Now, constraints on positions: 
- A can only be at position 4 or 5.
- D can only be at position 2, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 3, which we know).
- S cannot be at position 5 → must be at position 1, 2, or 4.

But note: S could be at position4? But A and D also cannot be at position4? No, they can? 

Now, impossible to have duplicates? No? But we have no evidence of duplicates? So we consider distinct? But we have four known letters? And they are distinct? So fifth letter? Then all must be distinct? 

So we need a word: 
_ _ U _ _ 
With:
- Letter at position 4 or 5 must be A? Or one of them is A? Exactly one A? But not? We have one A? Position? Either 4 or 5? 
- Similarly, D must be at position 2,4,5? 
- S must be at position 1,2,4? 

But position? And one more letter at the remaining position? 

For example:
- If A is at position 4, then position 4 is A? Then S cannot be at 4? Since S is different? Similarly, D? 
Cases: 
1. A at position 4? 
   - Then position 4 = A? 
   - Then D must be at position 2 or 5? 
   - S must be at position 1 or 2? 
   - Position 5? Or position 1? 

2. If A at position 5? 
   - Then position 5 = A? 
   - Then D must be at position 2 or 4? 
   - S must be at position 1,2, or 4? 

Now, also S not at position5? But in case 2: A at position5? Then S cannot be at5? So position5 is A? Not S? So S must be at 1,2, or4? 

Now, possible words? We need to form with valid English words? 

For example: 

Case 1: position4 = A? Then word: ? ? U A ? 
Possible: 
- Position1: S? Then position2: ? but D must be at position2 or5? If position1=S, position2=? but D must be at 2 or5? And S cannot be at position2? Not required? Position2 can be anything? 

For example: 
- S at position1: then D at position2 or5? And position4=A? and position5 must be D or the fifth letter? 

But if D at position2: then S1 D2 U3 A4 ?5? Then position5 must be the fifth letter? And S is at1? 
Similarly, if D at position5: then S1 ?2 U3 A4 D5? 

Then the word must have? in position2? 

Also, the fifth letter? 

Similarly, case 2: position5=A? Then word: ? ? U ? A 
With D at position2 or4? And S at position1,2,4? 

Also, position4 must be the fifth letter? Or possibly D? Or S? 

Now, we need to find actual words? 

Possibilities:
For Case 1: pattern ? ? U A ? 
- S at1, D at2? So S D U A ? → word like SDUA? Not meaningful? 
- Possibly: SQUAD? But SQUAD: S1,Q2,U3,A4,D5 → this matches? But we have Q2? And note: Q is not forbidden? But in this word? 
But our pattern: if A is at position4? Yes? Then D at position5? So SQUAD? 
But let's see D position? D5: and in SQUAD, we have D at5? 
And U at3? Fixed? 
Then A at position4? But we also have S at position1? 
And Q at position2? 
Now, constraints? 
- A is at position4? → allowed? 
- D is at position5? → allowed? D can be at position5? 
- S is at position1? → allowed? 
- U at position3? correct? 
- Q? unknown? 
Also, SQUAD avoids all forbidden letters? 

But we also have the constraint from daubs: D(-) at position1? And S(-) at position5? Yes? 
In SQUAD, S is at1? So we would expect S to be checked? Feedback? And D at5? 
Moreover, SQUAD is a valid word? 

But case 2? Pattern ? ? U ? A 
For example: 
- S at1? D at2? Then S D U ? A → S D U ? A → e.g., S D U L A ? SDULA? not word? 
- Or S at4? But S cannot be at4? Or? 
If S at4? Then pattern: ?1 ?2 U3 S4 A5? 
But then D must be at position? D cannot be at4? Because position4 occupied by S? So D must be at position2? Then pattern: ?1 D2 U3 S4 A5? 
Then position1? Must be a letter? For example: GDUSA? Not word? 
Possible words? Like in the pattern: ? D U S A → words? 
Common? ""SUDSA""? Not? 
Perhaps ""DUSKY"" but O? not? and A? 
No? 

Another possibility? D at position4? Then for Case 2: position5=A? So pattern: ?1 ?2 U3 D4 A5? 
Then S must be at position1 or2? 
For example: S at1: S ? U D A → e.g., S T U D A? STUD is not? but it's part of? Not?
Or S L U D A? 
Also, not obvious? 

Therefore, SQUAD seems a good candidate? 

We already had SQUAD? Also, consider letters? S,Q,U,A,D → acceptable? 

But we haven't tested Q? 

Now? We have feedback: we got U(✓) at position3? 
And SQUAD has U at position3? 

Also, we need to check? 

But from ""daubs"" feedback? 
We also have D(-)? Not at position1? 
But SQUAD: D is at position5? So not at position1? Correct? 

S(-) not at position5? SQUAD: S is at position1? So not at position5? Correct? 

A(-) not at position2? SQUAD: A at position4? So not at position2? Correct? 

Therefore, SQUAD matches the constraints? 

But is it the word? We don't know? It fits the pattern? So we can guess? 

Perhaps there are others? But SQUAD seems valid? 

Alternatively, ""PLUSH""? But PLUSH: P,L,U,S,H? No? Position? U at3? But PLUSH: P1,L2,U3,S4,H5? 
Then A not present? But we must have A? Present? So SQUAD has A? 

Similarly, the pattern does not fit? 

Another word: ""SAUD""? 4 letters? 
""SAUED""? But E? forbidden? 

Therefore, SQUAD appears to be a possible word? 

So we can guess ""SQUAD"" ? 

But let me double-check? 

The pattern: 
Position1: S? → from daubs, S is not at position5? But it could be at position1? 
Position2: Q? 
Position3: U → fixed? 
Position4: A? → A must be at position4? Since cannot be at pos1,2,3? And 4 is the only possibility? But could be position5? As in case 2? 
Earlier I considered two cases? 

But SQUAD has A at position4? Which is allowed? 

Alternatively, if A were at position5? Then we need a word ending with A? 
For example: S? U? D? A? or something? 

Words like: ""SHUDA""? Not standard? 
""QUOTA""? But O? forbidden? 
Therefore, SQUAD becomes the only plausible option? 

And it uses Q? But we haven't excluded Q? 

So let's guess SQUAD? 

Format: <guess>squad</guess> 

Step-by-step reasoning? 

We have U confirmed at position3? So secret word: ? ? U ? ? 

A must be at position4 or5? 
D must be at position2,4,5? 
S must be at position1,2,4? With position3 taken? 

If we put S at position1? 
Then D at position2,4,5? 
But if A at position4? Then conflict at position4? Cannot be both A and D? So then if A at position4? Then D must be at position2 or5? 
Similarly, if A at position5? Then D can be at position2 or4? 

Now, if S at1? 
Case A at4: pattern S . U A . 
Then D? Must be at position2 or5? 
So S D U A . or S . U A D 

S . U A . → for example: SQUAD? S Q U A D? Here A is at position4? D at position5? 

Case A at5: pattern S . U . A 
Then D? Must be at position2 or4? 
Thus, S D U . A → e.g., S D U X A? But X might be? 
Or S . U D A → e.g., S Q U D A → SQUDA? Not a word? 

Therefore, SQUAD fits? 

And SQUAD matches the constraints: 
- U at position3? Correct? 
- A at position4? Allowed? 
- S at position1? Allowed? 
- D at position5? Allowed? 
- Q: unknown? 

Therefore, SQUAD is the guess? 

Note: Q is a letter? Possible? And SQUAD is valid? 

Alternatively? ""SWUNG""? But no A? So cannot? 

Therefore, SQUAD is a strong candidate?
