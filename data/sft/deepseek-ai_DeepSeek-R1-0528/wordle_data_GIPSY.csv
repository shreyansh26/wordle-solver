We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that does not include any of these excluded letters.

 We need a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback.

 Common English letters that are not in the excluded set: 
 After removing C, R, A, N, E, we can consider letters like S, T, O, I, L, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

 Let's try to pick a word that has 5 common letters not in the excluded set.

 Some good candidates: 
   ""SLOTH"" - contains S, L, O, T, H
   ""PIOUS"" - contains P, I, O, U, S
   ""MOUND"" - contains M, O, U, N, D -> but N is excluded, so avoid N.

 Remember: we must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 Let me think of words without those letters:

   ""SIGHT"" - S, I, G, H, T
   ""DOUGH"" - D, O, U, G, H
   ""PLUMB"" - P, L, U, M, B

 However, we want to use as many common letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""TOILS"" - T, O, I, L, S

 But let me check the frequency of consonants: 
   Common consonants left: S, T, L, O, M, P, H, I, U, G, D, B, K, etc.

 Since we have 5 letters to choose, we can form words like ""MUSIC"" -> but M, U, S, I, C -> but C is excluded.

 How about ""PODGY""? But PODGY: P, O, D, G, Y.

 Alternatively, ""STOMP"": S, T, O, M, P -> avoids the excluded letters.

 ""STOMP"" is a valid English word.

 Another candidate: ""LUMPS"" -> L, U, M, P, S.

 But using high frequency letters: S, T, O, M, P.

 I think ""STOMP"" is a good choice because it uses very common letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.

2. ""stomp"": 
   - S is present but in the wrong position (-)
   - T is absent (x)
   - O is absent (x)
   - M is absent (x)
   - P is present but in the wrong position (-)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains S and P, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""stomp"". Since ""stomp"" was S in position 1 and P in position 5, the S cannot be in position 1 and P cannot be in position 5.
- The secret word does not contain T, O, M (in addition to the previously excluded C, R, A, N, E).

So, excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, M.

Included letters: S and P.

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and P (and three other letters not in the excluded set)
- Does not have S in position 1 or P in position 5.

We also know that the word must be composed of letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, T.

The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we know S and P must be in the word.

We need to choose a word that uses other common letters to test more possibilities.

Possible positions for S and P:
- S cannot be in position 1 (from ""stomp"" feedback). It can be in positions 2,3,4,5.
- P cannot be in position 5. It can be in positions 1,2,3,4.

We also need to avoid the excluded letters.

Let's think of words that have S and P and three other letters from the remaining set.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, U, W, Y.

We can try to form words.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""SPIKY"" -> but S is in position 1 (which is not allowed because S cannot be in position 1) and also we have to avoid positions? Actually, we can use S in position 1? But the feedback says S is present but not in position 1, so we cannot put S in position 1. So ""SPIKY"" is invalid because S is in position 1.

We must avoid putting S in position 1 and P in position 5.

Another idea: ""LISPS"" -> L, I, S, P, S. But that has two S's? And also, P is in position 4 and S in position 5. But we have to check if the word is valid.

But note: the feedback for ""stomp"" only told us that S is in the word but not in position 1, and P is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn't say anything about duplicates. However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But to be safe, we should consider that possibility.

But for now, let's try to find a word without duplicates to maximize information.

Possible words:

- ""PULPS"": P in position 1 (allowed), U, L, P (duplicate P), S in position 5 (but P cannot be in position 5? Wait, the feedback says P is not in position 5, but S can be in position 5? Yes, because the feedback only restricted P from position 5, not S. However, we have duplicate P and also we are using P in position 1 and 4? And S in position 5. But we don't know if the word has two P's. It might, but we are trying to avoid duplicates for now.

Alternatively, ""SPLIT"": but S is in position 1 -> not allowed.

""PICKS"": P in position 1, I, C, K, S -> but C is excluded (from first guess). So invalid.

""PICKS"" has C, which is excluded.

We need to avoid excluded letters.

Another word: ""PICKS"" is invalid because of C.

""DISKS"": D, I, S, K, S -> but S in position 3 and 5? And we have two S's. Also, position 1 is D, which is allowed. But we have two S's? And we don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we are using S in position 3 and 5, which is allowed because the feedback only said S is not in position 1.

But let's check the letters: D, I, S, K, S. Excluded? D, I, S, K are not excluded? S is included, but we are using it twice. The word ""DISKS"" is valid? Actually, ""DISKS"" is a valid word (plural of disk).

But we have two S's. We might get less information. Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicates.

Another idea: ""HIPS"" is 4 letters, too short.

""SPHINX"" is 6 letters.

5-letter words with S and P and without excluded letters.

List of possible words: 
- ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> but no S. We must include S because we know S is in the word.

We must include both S and P.

So, words that contain S and P and three other letters from the remaining set.

Try: ""SPIKY"" -> invalid because S in position 1.

""PSYCH"" -> but C and H? C is excluded, and also it's 5 letters? ""PSYCH"" is 5 letters? P,S,Y,C,H. But C is excluded.

""SWAMP"" -> but A and M are excluded.

""SLIPS"": S in position 1? Not allowed.

""LAMPS"" -> A and M excluded.

""PICKS"" -> C excluded.

""PICKS"" is out.

""BIPOD"" -> B,I,P,O,D -> but O is excluded.

""PILED"" -> P,I,L,E,D -> but E is excluded.

""GULPS"": G,U,L,P,S -> no excluded letters? 
Letters: G, U, L, P, S. 
Excluded: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, T. So G,U,L,P,S are all allowed.

And positions: 
- G in position 1
- U in 2
- L in 3
- P in 4 -> allowed (P not in 5)
- S in 5 -> allowed (S not in 1, and P not in 5)

So ""GULPS"" is a valid word.

But note: we have P in position 4 and S in position 5. The feedback from ""stomp"" said P is not in position 5, which is fine, and S is not in position 1, which is also fine.

We can also consider ""PLUSH"": P,L,U,S,H -> 
P in position 1 (allowed), L, U, S in position 4 (allowed, since S not in 1), H in 5. But P is in position 1, and we don't know if that's correct. Also, S is in position 4.

""PLUSH"" uses P,L,U,S,H. All allowed letters.

Another word: ""SPLIT"" is invalid because S in 1.

""PUSHY"": P,U,S,H,Y -> 
P in 1, U in 2, S in 3 (allowed), H in 4, Y in 5. 
But we have S in position 3, which is allowed.

We have two good candidates: ""GULPS"" and ""PUSHY"".

But we want to test more letters. ""GULPS"" uses G,U,L,P,S. ""PUSHY"" uses P,U,S,H,Y.

We also have to consider that we have two known letters (S and P) and we need to find the other three.

We might also consider words that put S and P in positions we haven't tried.

But we have limited tries, so we should choose a word that uses common letters and doesn't repeat the positions we've already tried for S and P.

In ""stomp"", S was in position 1 (wrong) and P in position 5 (wrong). So we know position 1 is not S and position 5 is not P.

In our next guess, we can try S in a new position and P in a new position.

For example, try S in position 2,3,4 and P in position 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

In ""GULPS"": S is in position 5 and P in position 4.
In ""PUSHY"": S is in position 3 and P in position 1.

We can also try a word with S in position 2 and P in position 3, for example.

But let's see what words exist.

Another word: ""DUMPY"" -> but M excluded.

""BUGSY"" -> B,U,G,S,Y -> but no P? We must include P.

We must have both S and P.

""BIPED"" -> E excluded.

""WISPY"": W,I,S,P,Y -> 
W in 1, I in 2, S in 3, P in 4, Y in 5. 
All letters allowed? W,I,S,P,Y: none excluded. 
S is in position 3 (allowed), P in position 4 (allowed). 

""WISPY"" is a valid word.

Now, comparing ""GULPS"", ""PUSHY"", and ""WISPY"":

- ""GULPS"": uses G,U,L,P,S. Positions: S at 5, P at 4.
- ""PUSHY"": uses P,U,S,H,Y. Positions: P at 1, S at 3.
- ""WISPY"": uses W,I,S,P,Y. Positions: S at 3, P at 4.

We want to maximize the information by testing new letters and new positions.

We have already tried positions for S and P in ""stomp"": S was in 1 (wrong) and P in 5 (wrong). So we avoid those.

In ""PUSHY"", we are trying P in position 1 and S in position 3.
In ""WISPY"", we are trying S in position 3 and P in position 4.
In ""GULPS"", we are trying P in position 4 and S in position 5.

We also want to test letters that are common and not yet tried.

We have tried: from ""crane"": C,R,A,N,E and from ""stomp"": S,T,O,M,P. So we have tried: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O,M,P.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, U, W, Y.

In ""PUSHY"": we are using P (already known), S (known), and new letters: U, H, Y.
In ""WISPY"": using S, P, and new: W, I, Y.
In ""GULPS"": using P, S, and new: G, U, L.

All three are good. We can choose one arbitrarily or based on letter frequency.

Letter frequency in English: E is the most common, but excluded. Then T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... 

But we have excluded many. Among the remaining: S and P are already known. Then common ones: H, I, U, L, D, etc.

""PUSHY"" has H and Y, and U.
""WISPY"" has W, I, Y.
""GULPS"" has G, U, L.

H is more common than W and G. U is common.

But we are not sure.

We can also consider that we have 6 tries, so we can choose a word that might be the answer if it fits.

But without more information, we need to test.

Another candidate: ""SHIP"" is 4 letters.

""PIGS"" is 4.

""SPIG"" not a word.

""SPIVS"" -> but V and two S's? ""SPIVS"" is not common.

""SPLIT"" invalid.

""SPLAT"" -> A excluded.

""SPLIT"" not allowed.

I think ""PUSHY"" is a good choice because it tests P in position 1 (which we haven't tested before) and S in position 3, and new common letters.

Similarly, ""WISPY"" tests S in 3 and P in 4.

But note: in ""stomp"", we had S in 1 (wrong) and P in 5 (wrong). We don't know about other positions.

I'll go with ""PUSHY"" because it uses P in a new position (1) and S in a new position (3), and includes H and Y which are common.

So, guess: ""PUSHY""

But let's write it: P-U-S-H-Y.

Positions: 
1: P (we don't know if correct, but allowed because feedback only said P is not in 5, not that it can't be in 1)
2: U
3: S (allowed because S not in 1)
4: H
5: Y

All letters are allowed.

So, I'll guess ""PUSHY"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these.
- **Guess 2: stomp** → S is present but wrong position (-), T/O/M are absent (x), P is present but wrong position (-). This means:
  - The secret word **contains S and P**, but S is not in position 1, and P is not in position 5.
  - The secret word **excludes T, O, M** (in addition to C, R, A, N, E from Guess 1).

**Key deductions:**
- **Excluded letters (9 total)**: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, T. The secret word uses only letters from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, S, U, V, W, Y.
- **Included letters (confirmed)**: S and P must appear, but not in positions 1 (for S) or 5 (for P).
- **Strategy for next guess**: Prioritize words with S and P in new positions (not 1 for S, not 5 for P) and test new high-frequency letters (e.g., H, I, U, L, Y) to maximize information.

**Selected guess: PUSHY**  
- **Why?** 
  - Contains S (position 3) and P (position 1), adhering to position constraints.
  - Uses new common letters (H, U, Y) not yet tested.
  - Avoids all excluded letters and duplicate letters for clearer feedback.
  - Tests P in position 1 (new position) and S in position 3 (new position), which could reveal critical clues.

<guess>pushy</guess>",pushy,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.

2. ""stomp"": 
   - S is present but in the wrong position (-)
   - T is absent (x)
   - O is absent (x)
   - M is absent (x)
   - P is present but in the wrong position (-)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains S and P, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""stomp"". Since ""stomp"" was S in position 1 and P in position 5, the S cannot be in position 1 and P cannot be in position 5.
- The secret word does not contain T, O, M (in addition to the previously excluded C, R, A, N, E).

So, excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, M.

Included letters: S and P.

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and P (and three other letters not in the excluded set)
- Does not have S in position 1 or P in position 5.

We also know that the word must be composed of letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, T.

The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we know S and P must be in the word.

We need to choose a word that uses other common letters to test more possibilities.

Possible positions for S and P:
- S cannot be in position 1 (from ""stomp"" feedback). It can be in positions 2,3,4,5.
- P cannot be in position 5. It can be in positions 1,2,3,4.

We also need to avoid the excluded letters.

Let's think of words that have S and P and three other letters from the remaining set.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, U, W, Y.

We can try to form words.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""SPIKY"" -> but S is in position 1 (which is not allowed because S cannot be in position 1) and also we have to avoid positions? Actually, we can use S in position 1? But the feedback says S is present but not in position 1, so we cannot put S in position 1. So ""SPIKY"" is invalid because S is in position 1.

We must avoid putting S in position 1 and P in position 5.

Another idea: ""LISPS"" -> L, I, S, P, S. But that has two S's? And also, P is in position 4 and S in position 5. But we have to check if the word is valid.

But note: the feedback for ""stomp"" only told us that S is in the word but not in position 1, and P is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn't say anything about duplicates. However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But to be safe, we should consider that possibility.

But for now, let's try to find a word without duplicates to maximize information.

Possible words:

- ""PULPS"": P in position 1 (allowed), U, L, P (duplicate P), S in position 5 (but P cannot be in position 5? Wait, the feedback says P is not in position 5, but S can be in position 5? Yes, because the feedback only restricted P from position 5, not S. However, we have duplicate P and also we are using P in position 1 and 4? And S in position 5. But we don't know if the word has two P's. It might, but we are trying to avoid duplicates for now.

Alternatively, ""SPLIT"": but S is in position 1 -> not allowed.

""PICKS"": P in position 1, I, C, K, S -> but C is excluded (from first guess). So invalid.

""PICKS"" has C, which is excluded.

We need to avoid excluded letters.

Another word: ""PICKS"" is invalid because of C.

""DISKS"": D, I, S, K, S -> but S in position 3 and 5? And we have two S's. Also, position 1 is D, which is allowed. But we have two S's? And we don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we are using S in position 3 and 5, which is allowed because the feedback only said S is not in position 1.

But let's check the letters: D, I, S, K, S. Excluded? D, I, S, K are not excluded? S is included, but we are using it twice. The word ""DISKS"" is valid? Actually, ""DISKS"" is a valid word (plural of disk).

But we have two S's. We might get less information. Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicates.

Another idea: ""HIPS"" is 4 letters, too short.

""SPHINX"" is 6 letters.

5-letter words with S and P and without excluded letters.

List of possible words: 
- ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> but no S. We must include S because we know S is in the word.

We must include both S and P.

So, words that contain S and P and three other letters from the remaining set.

Try: ""SPIKY"" -> invalid because S in position 1.

""PSYCH"" -> but C and H? C is excluded, and also it's 5 letters? ""PSYCH"" is 5 letters? P,S,Y,C,H. But C is excluded.

""SWAMP"" -> but A and M are excluded.

""SLIPS"": S in position 1? Not allowed.

""LAMPS"" -> A and M excluded.

""PICKS"" -> C excluded.

""PICKS"" is out.

""BIPOD"" -> B,I,P,O,D -> but O is excluded.

""PILED"" -> P,I,L,E,D -> but E is excluded.

""GULPS"": G,U,L,P,S -> no excluded letters? 
Letters: G, U, L, P, S. 
Excluded: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, T. So G,U,L,P,S are all allowed.

And positions: 
- G in position 1
- U in 2
- L in 3
- P in 4 -> allowed (P not in 5)
- S in 5 -> allowed (S not in 1, and P not in 5)

So ""GULPS"" is a valid word.

But note: we have P in position 4 and S in position 5. The feedback from ""stomp"" said P is not in position 5, which is fine, and S is not in position 1, which is also fine.

We can also consider ""PLUSH"": P,L,U,S,H -> 
P in position 1 (allowed), L, U, S in position 4 (allowed, since S not in 1), H in 5. But P is in position 1, and we don't know if that's correct. Also, S is in position 4.

""PLUSH"" uses P,L,U,S,H. All allowed letters.

Another word: ""SPLIT"" is invalid because S in 1.

""PUSHY"": P,U,S,H,Y -> 
P in 1, U in 2, S in 3 (allowed), H in 4, Y in 5. 
But we have S in position 3, which is allowed.

We have two good candidates: ""GULPS"" and ""PUSHY"".

But we want to test more letters. ""GULPS"" uses G,U,L,P,S. ""PUSHY"" uses P,U,S,H,Y.

We also have to consider that we have two known letters (S and P) and we need to find the other three.

We might also consider words that put S and P in positions we haven't tried.

But we have limited tries, so we should choose a word that uses common letters and doesn't repeat the positions we've already tried for S and P.

In ""stomp"", S was in position 1 (wrong) and P in position 5 (wrong). So we know position 1 is not S and position 5 is not P.

In our next guess, we can try S in a new position and P in a new position.

For example, try S in position 2,3,4 and P in position 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

In ""GULPS"": S is in position 5 and P in position 4.
In ""PUSHY"": S is in position 3 and P in position 1.

We can also try a word with S in position 2 and P in position 3, for example.

But let's see what words exist.

Another word: ""DUMPY"" -> but M excluded.

""BUGSY"" -> B,U,G,S,Y -> but no P? We must include P.

We must have both S and P.

""BIPED"" -> E excluded.

""WISPY"": W,I,S,P,Y -> 
W in 1, I in 2, S in 3, P in 4, Y in 5. 
All letters allowed? W,I,S,P,Y: none excluded. 
S is in position 3 (allowed), P in position 4 (allowed). 

""WISPY"" is a valid word.

Now, comparing ""GULPS"", ""PUSHY"", and ""WISPY"":

- ""GULPS"": uses G,U,L,P,S. Positions: S at 5, P at 4.
- ""PUSHY"": uses P,U,S,H,Y. Positions: P at 1, S at 3.
- ""WISPY"": uses W,I,S,P,Y. Positions: S at 3, P at 4.

We want to maximize the information by testing new letters and new positions.

We have already tried positions for S and P in ""stomp"": S was in 1 (wrong) and P in 5 (wrong). So we avoid those.

In ""PUSHY"", we are trying P in position 1 and S in position 3.
In ""WISPY"", we are trying S in position 3 and P in position 4.
In ""GULPS"", we are trying P in position 4 and S in position 5.

We also want to test letters that are common and not yet tried.

We have tried: from ""crane"": C,R,A,N,E and from ""stomp"": S,T,O,M,P. So we have tried: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O,M,P.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, U, W, Y.

In ""PUSHY"": we are using P (already known), S (known), and new letters: U, H, Y.
In ""WISPY"": using S, P, and new: W, I, Y.
In ""GULPS"": using P, S, and new: G, U, L.

All three are good. We can choose one arbitrarily or based on letter frequency.

Letter frequency in English: E is the most common, but excluded. Then T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... 

But we have excluded many. Among the remaining: S and P are already known. Then common ones: H, I, U, L, D, etc.

""PUSHY"" has H and Y, and U.
""WISPY"" has W, I, Y.
""GULPS"" has G, U, L.

H is more common than W and G. U is common.

But we are not sure.

We can also consider that we have 6 tries, so we can choose a word that might be the answer if it fits.

""PIGS"" is 4.

""SPIG"" not a word.

""SPIVS"" -> but V and two S's? ""SPIVS"" is not common.

""SPLIT"" invalid.

""SPLAT"" -> A excluded.

""SPLIT"" not allowed.

I think ""PUSHY"" is a good choice because it tests P in position 1 (which we haven't tested before) and S in position 3, and new common letters.

Similarly, ""WISPY"" tests S in 3 and P in 4.

But note: in ""stomp"", we had S in 1 (wrong) and P in 5 (wrong). We don't know about other positions.

I'll go with ""PUSHY"" because it uses P in a new position (1) and S in a new position (3), and includes H and Y which are common.

So, guess: ""PUSHY""

But let's write it: P-U-S-H-Y.

Positions: 
1: P (we don't know if correct, but allowed because feedback only said P is not in 5, not that it can't be in 1)
2: U
3: S (allowed because S not in 1)
4: H
5: Y

All letters are allowed.

So, I'll guess ""PUSHY"".After analyzing the feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these.
- **Guess 2: stomp** → S is present but wrong position (-), T/O/M are absent (x), P is present but wrong position (-). This means:
  - The secret word **contains S and P**, but S is not in position 1, and P is not in position 5.
  - The secret word **excludes T, O, M** (in addition to C, R, A, N, E from Guess 1).

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,GIPSY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that does not include any of these excluded letters.

 We need a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback.

 Common English letters that are not in the excluded set: 
 After removing C, R, A, N, E, we can consider letters like S, T, O, I, L, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

 Let's try to pick a word that has 5 common letters not in the excluded set.

 Some good candidates: 
   ""SLOTH"" - contains S, L, O, T, H
   ""PIOUS"" - contains P, I, O, U, S
   ""MOUND"" - contains M, O, U, N, D -> but N is excluded, so avoid N.

 Remember: we must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 Let me think of words without those letters:

   ""SIGHT"" - S, I, G, H, T
   ""DOUGH"" - D, O, U, G, H
   ""PLUMB"" - P, L, U, M, B

 However, we want to use as many common letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""TOILS"" - T, O, I, L, S

 But let me check the frequency of consonants: 
   Common consonants left: S, T, L, O, M, P, H, I, U, G, D, B, K, etc.

 Since we have 5 letters to choose, we can form words like ""MUSIC"" -> but M, U, S, I, C -> but C is excluded.

 How about ""PODGY""? But PODGY: P, O, D, G, Y.

 Alternatively, ""STOMP"": S, T, O, M, P -> avoids the excluded letters.

 ""STOMP"" is a valid English word.

 Another candidate: ""LUMPS"" -> L, U, M, P, S.

 But using high frequency letters: S, T, O, M, P.

 I think ""STOMP"" is a good choice because it uses very common letters.

 Let me confirm: 
   S, T, O, M, P -> none of C, R, A, N, E.

 So, let's guess ""STOMP"".

<guess>stomp</guess>Based on the feedback that none of the letters in ""crane"" (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word, I need to select a new guess that excludes these letters to maximize information. 

I chose **STOMP** because:
- It contains five distinct common letters (S, T, O, M, P) not in the excluded set
- These letters are highly prevalent in 5-letter English words
- Getting feedback on them will efficiently narrow down possibilities

<guess>stomp</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: stomp -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(x) M(x) P(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.

2. ""stomp"": 
   - S is present but in the wrong position (-)
   - T is absent (x)
   - O is absent (x)
   - M is absent (x)
   - P is present but in the wrong position (-)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains S and P, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""stomp"". Since ""stomp"" was S in position 1 and P in position 5, the S cannot be in position 1 and P cannot be in position 5.
- The secret word does not contain T, O, M (in addition to the previously excluded C, R, A, N, E).

So, excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, M.

Included letters: S and P.

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and P (and three other letters not in the excluded set)
- Does not have S in position 1 or P in position 5.

We also know that the word must be composed of letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, T.

The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we know S and P must be in the word.

We need to choose a word that uses other common letters to test more possibilities.

Possible positions for S and P:
- S cannot be in position 1 (from ""stomp"" feedback). It can be in positions 2,3,4,5.
- P cannot be in position 5. It can be in positions 1,2,3,4.

We also need to avoid the excluded letters.

Let's think of words that have S and P and three other letters from the remaining set.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, U, W, Y.

We can try to form words.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""SPIKY"" -> but S is in position 1 (which is not allowed because S cannot be in position 1) and also we have to avoid positions? Actually, we can use S in position 1? But the feedback says S is present but not in position 1, so we cannot put S in position 1. So ""SPIKY"" is invalid because S is in position 1.

We must avoid putting S in position 1 and P in position 5.

Another idea: ""LISPS"" -> L, I, S, P, S. But that has two S's? And also, P is in position 4 and S in position 5. But we have to check if the word is valid.

But note: the feedback for ""stomp"" only told us that S is in the word but not in position 1, and P is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn't say anything about duplicates. However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But to be safe, we should consider that possibility.

But for now, let's try to find a word without duplicates to maximize information.

Possible words:

- ""PULPS"": P in position 1 (allowed), U, L, P (duplicate P), S in position 5 (but P cannot be in position 5? Wait, the feedback says P is not in position 5, but S can be in position 5? Yes, because the feedback only restricted P from position 5, not S. However, we have duplicate P and also we are using P in position 1 and 4? And S in position 5. But we don't know if the word has two P's. It might, but we are trying to avoid duplicates for now.

Alternatively, ""SPLIT"": but S is in position 1 -> not allowed.

""PICKS"": P in position 1, I, C, K, S -> but C is excluded (from first guess). So invalid.

""PICKS"" has C, which is excluded.

We need to avoid excluded letters.

Another word: ""PICKS"" is invalid because of C.

""DISKS"": D, I, S, K, S -> but S in position 3 and 5? And we have two S's. Also, position 1 is D, which is allowed. But we have two S's? And we don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we are using S in position 3 and 5, which is allowed because the feedback only said S is not in position 1.

But let's check the letters: D, I, S, K, S. Excluded? D, I, S, K are not excluded? S is included, but we are using it twice. The word ""DISKS"" is valid? Actually, ""DISKS"" is a valid word (plural of disk).

But we have two S's. We might get less information. Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicates.

Another idea: ""HIPS"" is 4 letters, too short.

""SPHINX"" is 6 letters.

5-letter words with S and P and without excluded letters.

List of possible words: 
- ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> but no S. We must include S because we know S is in the word.

We must include both S and P.

So, words that contain S and P and three other letters from the remaining set.

Try: ""SPIKY"" -> invalid because S in position 1.

""PSYCH"" -> but C and H? C is excluded, and also it's 5 letters? ""PSYCH"" is 5 letters? P,S,Y,C,H. But C is excluded.

""SWAMP"" -> but A and M are excluded.

""SLIPS"": S in position 1? Not allowed.

""LAMPS"" -> A and M excluded.

""PICKS"" -> C excluded.

""PICKS"" is out.

""BIPOD"" -> B,I,P,O,D -> but O is excluded.

""PILED"" -> P,I,L,E,D -> but E is excluded.

""GULPS"": G,U,L,P,S -> no excluded letters? 
Letters: G, U, L, P, S. 
Excluded: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, T. So G,U,L,P,S are all allowed.

And positions: 
- G in position 1
- U in 2
- L in 3
- P in 4 -> allowed (P not in 5)
- S in 5 -> allowed (S not in 1, and P not in 5)

So ""GULPS"" is a valid word.

But note: we have P in position 4 and S in position 5. The feedback from ""stomp"" said P is not in position 5, which is fine, and S is not in position 1, which is also fine.

We can also consider ""PLUSH"": P,L,U,S,H -> 
P in position 1 (allowed), L, U, S in position 4 (allowed, since S not in 1), H in 5. But P is in position 1, and we don't know if that's correct. Also, S is in position 4.

""PLUSH"" uses P,L,U,S,H. All allowed letters.

Another word: ""SPLIT"" is invalid because S in 1.

""PUSHY"": P,U,S,H,Y -> 
P in 1, U in 2, S in 3 (allowed), H in 4, Y in 5. 
But we have S in position 3, which is allowed.

We have two good candidates: ""GULPS"" and ""PUSHY"".

But we want to test more letters. ""GULPS"" uses G,U,L,P,S. ""PUSHY"" uses P,U,S,H,Y.

We also have to consider that we have two known letters (S and P) and we need to find the other three.

We might also consider words that put S and P in positions we haven't tried.

But we have limited tries, so we should choose a word that uses common letters and doesn't repeat the positions we've already tried for S and P.

In ""stomp"", S was in position 1 (wrong) and P in position 5 (wrong). So we know position 1 is not S and position 5 is not P.

In our next guess, we can try S in a new position and P in a new position.

For example, try S in position 2,3,4 and P in position 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

In ""GULPS"": S is in position 5 and P in position 4.
In ""PUSHY"": S is in position 3 and P in position 1.

We can also try a word with S in position 2 and P in position 3, for example.

But let's see what words exist.

Another word: ""DUMPY"" -> but M excluded.

""BUGSY"" -> B,U,G,S,Y -> but no P? We must include P.

We must have both S and P.

""BIPED"" -> E excluded.

""WISPY"": W,I,S,P,Y -> 
W in 1, I in 2, S in 3, P in 4, Y in 5. 
All letters allowed? W,I,S,P,Y: none excluded. 
S is in position 3 (allowed), P in position 4 (allowed). 

""WISPY"" is a valid word.

Now, comparing ""GULPS"", ""PUSHY"", and ""WISPY"":

- ""GULPS"": uses G,U,L,P,S. Positions: S at 5, P at 4.
- ""PUSHY"": uses P,U,S,H,Y. Positions: P at 1, S at 3.
- ""WISPY"": uses W,I,S,P,Y. Positions: S at 3, P at 4.

We want to maximize the information by testing new letters and new positions.

We have already tried positions for S and P in ""stomp"": S was in 1 (wrong) and P in 5 (wrong). So we avoid those.

In ""PUSHY"", we are trying P in position 1 and S in position 3.
In ""WISPY"", we are trying S in position 3 and P in position 4.
In ""GULPS"", we are trying P in position 4 and S in position 5.

We also want to test letters that are common and not yet tried.

We have tried: from ""crane"": C,R,A,N,E and from ""stomp"": S,T,O,M,P. So we have tried: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O,M,P.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, U, W, Y.

In ""PUSHY"": we are using P (already known), S (known), and new letters: U, H, Y.
In ""WISPY"": using S, P, and new: W, I, Y.
In ""GULPS"": using P, S, and new: G, U, L.

All three are good. We can choose one arbitrarily or based on letter frequency.

Letter frequency in English: E is the most common, but excluded. Then T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... 

But we have excluded many. Among the remaining: S and P are already known. Then common ones: H, I, U, L, D, etc.

""PUSHY"" has H and Y, and U.
""WISPY"" has W, I, Y.
""GULPS"" has G, U, L.

H is more common than W and G. U is common.

But we are not sure.

We can also consider that we have 6 tries, so we can choose a word that might be the answer if it fits.

But without more information, we need to test.

Another candidate: ""SHIP"" is 4 letters.

""PIGS"" is 4.

""SPIG"" not a word.

""SPIVS"" -> but V and two S's? ""SPIVS"" is not common.

""SPLIT"" invalid.

""SPLAT"" -> A excluded.

""SPLIT"" not allowed.

I think ""PUSHY"" is a good choice because it tests P in position 1 (which we haven't tested before) and S in position 3, and new common letters.

Similarly, ""WISPY"" tests S in 3 and P in 4.

But note: in ""stomp"", we had S in 1 (wrong) and P in 5 (wrong). We don't know about other positions.

I'll go with ""PUSHY"" because it uses P in a new position (1) and S in a new position (3), and includes H and Y which are common.

So, guess: ""PUSHY""

But let's write it: P-U-S-H-Y.

Positions: 
1: P (we don't know if correct, but allowed because feedback only said P is not in 5, not that it can't be in 1)
2: U
3: S (allowed because S not in 1)
4: H
5: Y

All letters are allowed.

So, I'll guess ""PUSHY"".After analyzing the feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these.
- **Guess 2: stomp** → S is present but wrong position (-), T/O/M are absent (x), P is present but wrong position (-). This means:
  - The secret word **contains S and P**, but S is not in position 1, and P is not in position 5.
  - The secret word **excludes T, O, M** (in addition to C, R, A, N, E from Guess 1).

**Key deductions:**
- **Excluded letters (9 total)**: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, T. The secret word uses only letters from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, S, U, V, W, Y.
- **Included letters (confirmed)**: S and P must appear, but not in positions 1 (for S) or 5 (for P).
- **Strategy for next guess**: Prioritize words with S and P in new positions (not 1 for S, not 5 for P) and test new high-frequency letters (e.g., H, I, U, L, Y) to maximize information.

**Selected guess: PUSHY**  
- **Why?** 
  - Contains S (position 3) and P (position 1), adhering to position constraints.
  - Uses new common letters (H, U, Y) not yet tested.
  - Avoids all excluded letters and duplicate letters for clearer feedback.
  - Tests P in position 1 (new position) and S in position 3 (new position), which could reveal critical clues.

We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).
2. ""stomp"": 
   - S: present, wrong position (so S is in the word, but not at position 1)
   - T: absent
   - O: absent
   - M: absent
   - P: present, wrong position (so P is in the word, but not at position 5)
3. ""pushy"":
   - P: present, wrong position (so P is in the word, but not at position 1, because we guessed it at position 1 and it's marked as wrong position)
   - U: absent
   - S: present, wrong position (so S is in the word, but not at position 3, because we guessed it at position 3 and it's marked as wrong position)
   - H: absent
   - Y: correct position (so Y is in the word and at position 5)

So, from all the feedback, we know:

- The word contains: S, P, and Y (with Y at position 5).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, M, U, H.
- Additionally, we know about the positions:
  - S is not in position 1, 3 (from ""stomp"" and ""pushy"")
  - P is not in position 1, 5 (from ""pushy"" and ""stomp"")

Also, Y is fixed at position 5.

So, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ Y

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with Y (position 5 is Y)
- Contains S and P (and two other letters, but we don't know which ones)
- The other letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Excluded letters: A, C, E, H, M, N, O, R, T, U.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, S, V, W, X, Y (but Y is already placed at 5, and P and S must be included).

But note: P and S are already in the word, so the other two letters must be from the remaining: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, V, W, X.

Also, S cannot be in position 1 or 3, and P cannot be in position 1 or 5 (but 5 is Y, so P can only be in 2,3,4? But wait, position 5 is taken by Y, so P can be in 2,3,4. Similarly, S can be in 2,4 (since not 1 or 3, and 5 is Y, so only 2 or 4).

Let's list possible positions for S and P:

- S can be in positions: 2 or 4 (because 1 and 3 are forbidden, and 5 is Y)
- P can be in positions: 2, 3, 4 (because 1 and 5 are forbidden, and 5 is Y so it's taken)

But note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 5 is fixed as Y.

So for S: available positions are 2 and 4 (since 1 and 3 are forbidden by previous feedback).

For P: available positions are 2,3,4 (since 1 and 5 are forbidden).

But S and P might be in the same position? No, because they are different letters. So they must be in different positions.

Now, we have to place S and P in the first four positions, with the constraints.

Also, we have two more letters to fill in the remaining two positions, from the allowed set.

We can consider the possibilities:

Case 1: S in position 2, then P can be in 3 or 4.
Case 2: S in position 4, then P can be in 2 or 3.

Now, we need to form valid words.

We also know that in ""pushy"", we had P at 1 (wrong) and S at 3 (wrong), and now we have Y at 5 correct.

We need to guess a word that fits these constraints.

Let's think of words ending with Y that contain S and P.

Common words: 
- ""SPICY"" -> but C is excluded.
- ""SPIKY"" -> but I and K are allowed? But S is at 1, which is forbidden for S. Also, we have to avoid position 1 for S.
- ""PALSY"" -> P,A,L,S,Y -> but A is excluded.
- ""GIPSY"" -> G,I,P,S,Y -> letters: G, I, P, S, Y. 
  - Positions: G1, I2, P3, S4, Y5.
  - Check constraints: 
      S is at position 4 -> allowed (since S can be at 4)
      P is at position 3 -> allowed (P can be at 3)
      Letters: G, I, P, S, Y. 
      Excluded letters: A, C, E, H, M, N, O, R, T, U. So G, I are allowed.
  - So ""GIPSY"" is a candidate.

Another word: ""WISPY"" -> W,I,S,P,Y -> 
  Positions: W1, I2, S3, P4, Y5.
  But S is at position 3 -> but from ""pushy"" feedback, S is not in position 3 (because we guessed S at 3 and it was marked as wrong position). So S cannot be at 3. Therefore, ""WISPY"" is invalid because S is in position 3.

Similarly, ""LISPY"" would have S in 3? ""LISPY"" is not a word. ""LISP"" is 4 letters.

Another word: ""DIPSY"" -> not common, but let's check: D,I,P,S,Y -> positions: D1, I2, P3, S4, Y5. Similar to GIPSY but with D. S at 4, P at 3. Allowed.

But is ""DIPSY"" a word? It might be a name or variant, but let's stick to common words.

""GIPSY"" is acceptable.

Another word: ""POSHY"" -> P,O,S,H,Y -> but O and H are excluded.

""BUSKY"" -> B,U,S,K,Y -> U is excluded.

""PUSSY"" -> P,U,S,S,Y -> U excluded and duplicate S? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but in this case U is excluded.

""FUSSY"" -> F,U,S,S,Y -> U excluded.

""JUICY"" -> J,U,I,C,Y -> U and C excluded.

""PICKY"" -> P,I,C,K,Y -> C excluded.

""LUCKY"" -> L,U,C,K,Y -> U and C excluded.

""DUSTY"" -> D,U,S,T,Y -> U and T excluded.

""GASSY"" -> G,A,S,S,Y -> A excluded and duplicate S.

""PANSY"" -> P,A,N,S,Y -> A and N excluded.

""BOSKY"" -> B,O,S,K,Y -> O excluded.

""WASPY"" -> W,A,S,P,Y -> A excluded.

""VISPY"" -> not a word.

""DISPY"" -> not a word.

""LIPPY"" -> L,I,P,P,Y -> duplicate P? And positions: L1, I2, P3, P4, Y5. But P is at 3 and 4? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to check if S is included? ""LIPPY"" has no S, so invalid because we must have S.

We must have both S and P.

Another candidate: ""SPLAY"" -> S,P,L,A,Y -> A excluded.

""SPINY"" -> S,P,I,N,Y -> N excluded.

""SPICY"" -> C excluded.

""SPUMY"" -> not common, and U might be excluded? U is excluded.

""SKIMP"" -> but doesn't end with Y.

We need words ending with Y.

""GIMPY"" -> G,I,M,P,Y -> M excluded.

""BALDY"" -> A excluded.

""BULGY"" -> U excluded.

""FILMY"" -> M excluded.

""PALLY"" -> A excluded and duplicate L? 

""JELLY"" -> E excluded.

""KINKY"" -> K,I,N,K,Y -> N excluded.

""FUNKY"" -> U excluded.

""BUGGY"" -> U? B,U,G,G,Y -> U excluded.

""BAGGY"" -> A excluded.

""DOGGY"" -> O excluded? D,O,G,G,Y -> O excluded.

""FOGGY"" -> O excluded.

""SOGGY"" -> O excluded.

""PIGGY"" -> I,G,G,Y -> but missing S? We need S.

We must have S.

So back to ""GIPSY"": G-I-P-S-Y.

We also have ""DIPSY"" or ""TIPSY"" -> T,I,P,S,Y -> but T is excluded (from ""stomp"" feedback).

T is excluded, so ""TIPSY"" is invalid.

""HIPPY"" -> H excluded and duplicate P.

""SYLPH"" -> but doesn't end with Y.

""LYMPH"" -> doesn't end with Y.

We might have to consider less common words.

Another idea: ""GYPSY"" -> G,Y,P,S,Y? No, that's 5 letters? G-Y-P-S-Y? That would be two Y's? ""GYPSY"" is spelled G-Y-P-S-Y? Actually, ""GYPSY"" is G-Y-P-S-Y, so positions: G1, Y2, P3, S4, Y5. But we have Y at position 2 and 5? But the word ends with Y, which is fixed at position 5. But in ""GYPSY"", position 2 is also Y? That would be duplicate Y.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in our feedback, we have Y at position 5 correct, but we don't know if there is another Y.

But in ""GYPSY"", we have Y at 2 and 5. But we have to check the constraints:

- S is at position 4: allowed (S can be at 4)
- P is at position 3: allowed (P can be at 3)
- But Y is at position 2: we don't have feedback about Y at other positions, but the word can have duplicate Y? However, the feedback for ""pushy"" had Y at 5 correct, but it doesn't say anything about other positions of Y.

But the word ""GYPSY"" has two Y's. Is that possible? Yes, but we need to see if it fits.

Letters: G, Y, P, S, Y. 
- G: allowed
- Y: allowed (but we already know Y is at 5, and now also at 2? That's possible if the word has two Y's)
- P: allowed and must be present
- S: allowed and must be present

But we have two Y's? The feedback from ""pushy"" only said that the letter Y is at position 5, but it doesn't say that there is only one Y. So duplicate Y is possible.

But in ""GYPSY"", position 2 is Y, which we haven't tested yet.

However, we have excluded letters: none of G, Y, P, S are excluded.

But we must check the position constraints for S and P: S at 4 (allowed), P at 3 (allowed).

Also, for S: not in 1 or 3? In ""GYPSY"", S is at 4, which is allowed. P is at 3, which is allowed.

But what about the first letter? G is at position 1, which is allowed (no constraint on G).

So ""GYPSY"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""GIPSY"" is also a candidate.

Now, which one to choose?

We also have to consider that in ""GYPSY"", we are using Y at position 2, which might be a duplicate. But if we guess ""GYPSY"" and it's not the word, we might get feedback that helps.

But we have limited guesses, so we might want to avoid duplicates if possible.

Another candidate: ""WASPY"" -> W,A,S,P,Y -> A excluded.

""JASPY"" -> not common.

""LYSIS"" -> no P.

We might have to go with ""GIPSY"" or ""GYPSY"".

But let's see if there is a word without duplicates.

For example, ""GIPSY"" has no duplicates: G,I,P,S,Y.

""GYPSY"" has duplicates (two Y's).

So ""GIPSY"" might be better for getting more information.

But we know Y is at 5, so if we put Y at 2, it might be correct or not.

But to avoid risk, we can try ""GIPSY"".

Another word: ""DIPSY"" -> D,I,P,S,Y. No duplicates. D is allowed.

But is ""DIPSY"" a valid word? It might be a variant or a name, but in Wordle, it might not be accepted. We should stick to common words.

""GIPSY"" is a common word (variant of gypsy).

Similarly, ""GYPSY"" is more common.

But let's look for other options.

""SPICY"" is invalid.

""PITHY"" -> P,I,T,H,Y -> T and H excluded.

""BITSY"" -> B,I,T,S,Y -> T excluded.

""PUDGY"" -> no S.

I think ""GIPSY"" is a good candidate.

But we have to make sure about the position of S and P.

In ""GIPSY"": 
- Position 1: G
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

Constraints:
- S is at position 4: allowed (since S cannot be at 1 or 3, and 4 is allowed)
- P is at position 3: allowed (since P cannot be at 1 or 5, and 3 is allowed)

Letters: G, I, P, S, Y. All allowed (not excluded).

So it's valid.

Similarly, for ""GYPSY"":
- Position 1: G
- Position 2: Y
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

S at 4 (allowed), P at 3 (allowed). But Y at 2 and 5.

Now, we have to choose between ""GIPSY"" and ""GYPSY"".

We can also consider ""WISPY"", but S is at 3 which is forbidden.

Another word: ""SPINY"" -> N excluded.

""SHILY"" -> H excluded.

""PALLY"" -> A excluded.

I think we should go with ""GIPSY"" because it doesn't have duplicate letters, so it might give us more information about the other positions.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4. We have two candidates that might be the answer.

We can also think of other words.

What about ""BLIPS"" -> doesn't end with Y.

We need to end with Y.

""FLIPS"" -> no.

""CRISP"" -> no.

I think ""GIPSY"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see if there is a word with S in position 2.

For example, if S is in position 2, then P can be in 3 or 4.

If P in 3: then word: _ S P _ Y

The first position must be a letter from the allowed set, and the fourth position similarly.

For example: 
- ""ASPIC"" -> not ending with Y and A excluded.
- ""JSP"" not a word.

""USHER"" -> U excluded.

Not many common words.

If P in 4: then word: _ S _ P Y

For example: ""ISOPY"" not a word. ""ASPY"" not 5 letters.

""WASPY"" -> A excluded.

""RASPY"" -> R excluded.

""GASPY"" -> A excluded.

So it seems difficult to have S in position 2.

Therefore, the more likely is S in position 4.

Then P can be in 2 or 3.

If P in 2: word: _ P _ S Y

For example: ""UPSET"" -> U and E excluded.

""APISH"" -> A excluded.

""OPIUM"" -> O and U excluded.

Not many.

If P in 3: word: _ _ P S Y

Then the first two positions: two letters from allowed set.

For example: 
- ""GIPSY"" -> G and I
- ""DIPSY"" -> D and I
- ""LIPSY"" -> L and I, but ""LIPSY"" not common.
- ""TIPSY"" -> T excluded.
- ""RIPSY"" -> R excluded.
- ""MIPSY"" -> M excluded.
- ""SHIPS"" -> no, doesn't end with Y.

So ""GIPSY"" and ""GYPSY"" are the main candidates.

I think ""GIPSY"" is a better choice because it doesn't have duplicate letters, so if it's not the word, we get information about G and I.

Whereas ""GYPSY"" has duplicate Y, and we already know Y is at 5, so if we put Y at 2 and it's not present, we know, but if it is present, we know there is a duplicate.

But to maximize information, ""GIPSY"" might be better.

Since we are on guess 4, and we have two possibilities, we can guess one.

I'll go with ""GIPSY"".

So, guess: ""GIPSY""

But let's write it.
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). The secret word contains none of these.
- **Guess 2: stomp** → 
  - S is present but wrong position (-) → S is in the word, but not position 1.
  - T, O, M are absent (x) → Excluded from the word.
  - P is present but wrong position (-) → P is in the word, but not position 5.
- **Guess 3: pushy** → 
  - P is present but wrong position (-) → P is in the word, but not position 1 (confirms position constraint from Guess 2).
  - U is absent (x) → Excluded from the word.
  - S is present but wrong position (-) → S is in the word, but not position 3 (new constraint).
  - H is absent (x) → Excluded from the word.
  - Y is correct (✓) → Y is in the word and in position 5.

### Key Deductions
1. **Confirmed Letters**:
   - **Y** is in position 5 (fixed).
   - **S** and **P** are in the word but with position constraints:
     - S cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
     - P cannot be in positions 1 or 5.
   - Since position 5 is fixed as Y, S can only be in positions 2 or 4, and P can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

2. **Excluded Letters** (13 total):  
   A, C, E, H, M, N, O, R, T, U (from all feedback), plus the absent letters from ""crane"" (C, R, A, N, E) and ""stomp"" (T, O, M).

3. **Remaining Possible Letters**:  
   B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, V, W, X (Y, S, P are confirmed but must be placed appropriately).

4. **Word Structure**:  
   The secret word is `_ _ _ _ Y` (position 5 is Y). S and P must occupy two of positions 2, 3, or 4, with S restricted to 2 or 4 and P restricted to 2, 3, or 4. The remaining positions must be filled with letters from the remaining pool.

5. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Prioritize words ending in Y, containing S and P, and avoiding excluded letters.
   - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., G, I, L, D) to maximize information.
   - Avoid positions forbidden for S (1, 3) and P (1, 5).
   - Given the constraints, possible candidate words include:
     - **GIPSY**: Positions—G1, I2, P3, S4, Y5.  
       (S in position 4 and P in position 3 are allowed; tests G and I.)
     - **GYPSY**: Positions—G1, Y2, P3, S4, Y5.  
       (S in position 4 and P in position 3 are allowed; tests G and duplicate Y, which is less ideal for information gain.)
     - **DIPSY**: Positions—D1, I2, P3, S4, Y5.  
       (Similar to GIPSY but with D; less common word.)
   - **GIPSY is selected** because:
     - It uses distinct letters (no duplicates), ensuring clearer feedback.
     - It tests S in position 4 and P in position 3—new positions not yet evaluated.
     - It introduces two new common letters (G and I) from the remaining pool.
     - It is a valid English word (variant of ""gypsy"") and fits all constraints.

<guess>gipsy</guess>",gipsy,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).
2. ""stomp"": 
   - S: present, wrong position (so S is in the word, but not at position 1)
   - T: absent
   - O: absent
   - M: absent
   - P: present, wrong position (so P is in the word, but not at position 5)
3. ""pushy"":
   - P: present, wrong position (so P is in the word, but not at position 1, because we guessed it at position 1 and it's marked as wrong position)
   - U: absent
   - S: present, wrong position (so S is in the word, but not at position 3, because we guessed it at position 3 and it's marked as wrong position)
   - H: absent
   - Y: correct position (so Y is in the word and at position 5)

So, from all the feedback, we know:

- The word contains: S, P, and Y (with Y at position 5).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, M, U, H.
- Additionally, we know about the positions:
  - S is not in position 1, 3 (from ""stomp"" and ""pushy"")
  - P is not in position 1, 5 (from ""pushy"" and ""stomp"")

Also, Y is fixed at position 5.

So, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ Y

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with Y (position 5 is Y)
- Contains S and P (and two other letters, but we don't know which ones)
- The other letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Excluded letters: A, C, E, H, M, N, O, R, T, U.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, S, V, W, X, Y (but Y is already placed at 5, and P and S must be included).

But note: P and S are already in the word, so the other two letters must be from the remaining: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, V, W, X.

Also, S cannot be in position 1 or 3, and P cannot be in position 1 or 5 (but 5 is Y, so P can only be in 2,3,4? But wait, position 5 is taken by Y, so P can be in 2,3,4. Similarly, S can be in 2,4 (since not 1 or 3, and 5 is Y, so only 2 or 4).

Let's list possible positions for S and P:

- S can be in positions: 2 or 4 (because 1 and 3 are forbidden, and 5 is Y)
- P can be in positions: 2, 3, 4 (because 1 and 5 are forbidden, and 5 is Y so it's taken)

But note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 5 is fixed as Y.

So for S: available positions are 2 and 4 (since 1 and 3 are forbidden by previous feedback).

For P: available positions are 2,3,4 (since 1 and 5 are forbidden).

But S and P might be in the same position? No, because they are different letters. So they must be in different positions.

Now, we have to place S and P in the first four positions, with the constraints.

Also, we have two more letters to fill in the remaining two positions, from the allowed set.

We can consider the possibilities:

Case 1: S in position 2, then P can be in 3 or 4.
Case 2: S in position 4, then P can be in 2 or 3.

Now, we need to form valid words.

We also know that in ""pushy"", we had P at 1 (wrong) and S at 3 (wrong), and now we have Y at 5 correct.

We need to guess a word that fits these constraints.

Let's think of words ending with Y that contain S and P.

Common words: 
- ""SPICY"" -> but C is excluded.
- ""SPIKY"" -> but I and K are allowed? But S is at 1, which is forbidden for S. Also, we have to avoid position 1 for S.
- ""PALSY"" -> P,A,L,S,Y -> but A is excluded.
- ""GIPSY"" -> G,I,P,S,Y -> letters: G, I, P, S, Y. 
  - Positions: G1, I2, P3, S4, Y5.
  - Check constraints: 
      S is at position 4 -> allowed (since S can be at 4)
      P is at position 3 -> allowed (P can be at 3)
      Letters: G, I, P, S, Y. 
      Excluded letters: A, C, E, H, M, N, O, R, T, U. So G, I are allowed.
  - So ""GIPSY"" is a candidate.

Another word: ""WISPY"" -> W,I,S,P,Y -> 
  Positions: W1, I2, S3, P4, Y5.
  But S is at position 3 -> but from ""pushy"" feedback, S is not in position 3 (because we guessed S at 3 and it was marked as wrong position). So S cannot be at 3. Therefore, ""WISPY"" is invalid because S is in position 3.

Similarly, ""LISPY"" would have S in 3? ""LISPY"" is not a word. ""LISP"" is 4 letters.

Another word: ""DIPSY"" -> not common, but let's check: D,I,P,S,Y -> positions: D1, I2, P3, S4, Y5. Similar to GIPSY but with D. S at 4, P at 3. Allowed.

But is ""DIPSY"" a word? It might be a name or variant, but let's stick to common words.

""GIPSY"" is acceptable.

Another word: ""POSHY"" -> P,O,S,H,Y -> but O and H are excluded.

""BUSKY"" -> B,U,S,K,Y -> U is excluded.

""PUSSY"" -> P,U,S,S,Y -> U excluded and duplicate S? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but in this case U is excluded.

""FUSSY"" -> F,U,S,S,Y -> U excluded.

""JUICY"" -> J,U,I,C,Y -> U and C excluded.

""PICKY"" -> P,I,C,K,Y -> C excluded.

""LUCKY"" -> L,U,C,K,Y -> U and C excluded.

""DUSTY"" -> D,U,S,T,Y -> U and T excluded.

""GASSY"" -> G,A,S,S,Y -> A excluded and duplicate S.

""PANSY"" -> P,A,N,S,Y -> A and N excluded.

""BOSKY"" -> B,O,S,K,Y -> O excluded.

""WASPY"" -> W,A,S,P,Y -> A excluded.

""VISPY"" -> not a word.

""DISPY"" -> not a word.

""LIPPY"" -> L,I,P,P,Y -> duplicate P? And positions: L1, I2, P3, P4, Y5. But P is at 3 and 4? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to check if S is included? ""LIPPY"" has no S, so invalid because we must have S.

We must have both S and P.

Another candidate: ""SPLAY"" -> S,P,L,A,Y -> A excluded.

""SPINY"" -> S,P,I,N,Y -> N excluded.

""SPICY"" -> C excluded.

""SPUMY"" -> not common, and U might be excluded? U is excluded.

""SKIMP"" -> but doesn't end with Y.

We need words ending with Y.

""GIMPY"" -> G,I,M,P,Y -> M excluded.

""BALDY"" -> A excluded.

""BULGY"" -> U excluded.

""FILMY"" -> M excluded.

""PALLY"" -> A excluded and duplicate L? 

""JELLY"" -> E excluded.

""KINKY"" -> K,I,N,K,Y -> N excluded.

""FUNKY"" -> U excluded.

""BUGGY"" -> U? B,U,G,G,Y -> U excluded.

""BAGGY"" -> A excluded.

""DOGGY"" -> O excluded? D,O,G,G,Y -> O excluded.

""FOGGY"" -> O excluded.

""SOGGY"" -> O excluded.

""PIGGY"" -> I,G,G,Y -> but missing S? We need S.

We must have S.

So back to ""GIPSY"": G-I-P-S-Y.

We also have ""DIPSY"" or ""TIPSY"" -> T,I,P,S,Y -> but T is excluded (from ""stomp"" feedback).

T is excluded, so ""TIPSY"" is invalid.

""HIPPY"" -> H excluded and duplicate P.

""SYLPH"" -> but doesn't end with Y.

""LYMPH"" -> doesn't end with Y.

We might have to consider less common words.

Another idea: ""GYPSY"" -> G,Y,P,S,Y? No, that's 5 letters? G-Y-P-S-Y? That would be two Y's? ""GYPSY"" is spelled G-Y-P-S-Y? Actually, ""GYPSY"" is G-Y-P-S-Y, so positions: G1, Y2, P3, S4, Y5. But we have Y at position 2 and 5? But the word ends with Y, which is fixed at position 5. But in ""GYPSY"", position 2 is also Y? That would be duplicate Y.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in our feedback, we have Y at position 5 correct, but we don't know if there is another Y.

But in ""GYPSY"", we have Y at 2 and 5. But we have to check the constraints:

- S is at position 4: allowed (S can be at 4)
- P is at position 3: allowed (P can be at 3)
- But Y is at position 2: we don't have feedback about Y at other positions, but the word can have duplicate Y? However, the feedback for ""pushy"" had Y at 5 correct, but it doesn't say anything about other positions of Y.

But the word ""GYPSY"" has two Y's. Is that possible? Yes, but we need to see if it fits.

Letters: G, Y, P, S, Y. 
- G: allowed
- Y: allowed (but we already know Y is at 5, and now also at 2? That's possible if the word has two Y's)
- P: allowed and must be present
- S: allowed and must be present

But we have two Y's? The feedback from ""pushy"" only said that the letter Y is at position 5, but it doesn't say that there is only one Y. So duplicate Y is possible.

But in ""GYPSY"", position 2 is Y, which we haven't tested yet.

However, we have excluded letters: none of G, Y, P, S are excluded.

But we must check the position constraints for S and P: S at 4 (allowed), P at 3 (allowed).

Also, for S: not in 1 or 3? In ""GYPSY"", S is at 4, which is allowed. P is at 3, which is allowed.

But what about the first letter? G is at position 1, which is allowed (no constraint on G).

So ""GYPSY"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""GIPSY"" is also a candidate.

Now, which one to choose?

We also have to consider that in ""GYPSY"", we are using Y at position 2, which might be a duplicate. But if we guess ""GYPSY"" and it's not the word, we might get feedback that helps.

But we have limited guesses, so we might want to avoid duplicates if possible.

Another candidate: ""WASPY"" -> W,A,S,P,Y -> A excluded.

""JASPY"" -> not common.

""LYSIS"" -> no P.

We might have to go with ""GIPSY"" or ""GYPSY"".

But let's see if there is a word without duplicates.

For example, ""GIPSY"" has no duplicates: G,I,P,S,Y.

""GYPSY"" has duplicates (two Y's).

So ""GIPSY"" might be better for getting more information.

But we know Y is at 5, so if we put Y at 2, it might be correct or not.

But to avoid risk, we can try ""GIPSY"".

Another word: ""DIPSY"" -> D,I,P,S,Y. No duplicates. D is allowed.

But is ""DIPSY"" a valid word? It might be a variant or a name, but in Wordle, it might not be accepted. We should stick to common words.

""GIPSY"" is a common word (variant of gypsy).

Similarly, ""GYPSY"" is more common.

But let's look for other options.

""SPICY"" is invalid.

""PITHY"" -> P,I,T,H,Y -> T and H excluded.

""BITSY"" -> B,I,T,S,Y -> T excluded.

""PUDGY"" -> no S.

I think ""GIPSY"" is a good candidate.

But we have to make sure about the position of S and P.

In ""GIPSY"": 
- Position 1: G
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

Constraints:
- S is at position 4: allowed (since S cannot be at 1 or 3, and 4 is allowed)
- P is at position 3: allowed (since P cannot be at 1 or 5, and 3 is allowed)

Letters: G, I, P, S, Y. All allowed (not excluded).

So it's valid.

Similarly, for ""GYPSY"":
- Position 1: G
- Position 2: Y
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

S at 4 (allowed), P at 3 (allowed). But Y at 2 and 5.

Now, we have to choose between ""GIPSY"" and ""GYPSY"".

We can also consider ""WISPY"", but S is at 3 which is forbidden.

Another word: ""SPINY"" -> N excluded.

""SHILY"" -> H excluded.

""PALLY"" -> A excluded.

I think we should go with ""GIPSY"" because it doesn't have duplicate letters, so it might give us more information about the other positions.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4. We have two candidates that might be the answer.

We can also think of other words.

What about ""BLIPS"" -> doesn't end with Y.

We need to end with Y.

""FLIPS"" -> no.

""CRISP"" -> no.

I think ""GIPSY"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see if there is a word with S in position 2.

For example, if S is in position 2, then P can be in 3 or 4.

If P in 3: then word: _ S P _ Y

The first position must be a letter from the allowed set, and the fourth position similarly.

For example: 
- ""ASPIC"" -> not ending with Y and A excluded.
- ""JSP"" not a word.

""USHER"" -> U excluded.

Not many common words.

If P in 4: then word: _ S _ P Y

For example: ""ISOPY"" not a word. ""ASPY"" not 5 letters.

""WASPY"" -> A excluded.

""RASPY"" -> R excluded.

""GASPY"" -> A excluded.

So it seems difficult to have S in position 2.

Therefore, the more likely is S in position 4.

Then P can be in 2 or 3.

If P in 2: word: _ P _ S Y

For example: ""UPSET"" -> U and E excluded.

""APISH"" -> A excluded.

""OPIUM"" -> O and U excluded.

Not many.

If P in 3: word: _ _ P S Y

Then the first two positions: two letters from allowed set.

For example: 
- ""GIPSY"" -> G and I
- ""DIPSY"" -> D and I
- ""LIPSY"" -> L and I, but ""LIPSY"" not common.
- ""TIPSY"" -> T excluded.
- ""RIPSY"" -> R excluded.
- ""MIPSY"" -> M excluded.
- ""SHIPS"" -> no, doesn't end with Y.

So ""GIPSY"" and ""GYPSY"" are the main candidates.

I think ""GIPSY"" is a better choice because it doesn't have duplicate letters, so if it's not the word, we get information about G and I.

Whereas ""GYPSY"" has duplicate Y, and we already know Y is at 5, so if we put Y at 2 and it's not present, we know, but if it is present, we know there is a duplicate.

But to maximize information, ""GIPSY"" might be better.

Since we are on guess 4, and we have two possibilities, we can guess one.

I'll go with ""GIPSY"".

So, guess: ""GIPSY""

But let's write it.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). The secret word contains none of these.
- **Guess 2: stomp** → 
  - S is present but wrong position (-) → S is in the word, but not position 1.
  - T, O, M are absent (x) → Excluded from the word.
  - P is present but wrong position (-) → P is in the word, but not position 5.
- **Guess 3: pushy** → 
  - P is present but wrong position (-) → P is in the word, but not position 1 (confirms position constraint from Guess 2).
  - U is absent (x) → Excluded from the word.
  - S is present but wrong position (-) → S is in the word, but not position 3 (new constraint).
  - H is absent (x) → Excluded from the word.
  - Y is correct (✓) → Y is in the word and in position 5.

### Key Deductions
1. **Confirmed Letters**:
   - **Y** is in position 5 (fixed).
   - **S** and **P** are in the word but with position constraints:
     - S cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
     - P cannot be in positions 1 or 5.
   - Since position 5 is fixed as Y, S can only be in positions 2 or 4, and P can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

2. **Excluded Letters** (13 total):  
   A, C, E, H, M, N, O, R, T, U (from all feedback), plus the absent letters from ""crane"" (C, R, A, N, E) and ""stomp"" (T, O, M).

3. **Remaining Possible Letters**:  
   B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, V, W, X (Y, S, P are confirmed but must be placed appropriately).

4. **Word Structure**:  
   The secret word is `_ _ _ _ Y` (position 5 is Y). S and P must occupy two of positions 2, 3, or 4, with S restricted to 2 or 4 and P restricted to 2, 3, or 4. The remaining positions must be filled with letters from the remaining pool.

5. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Prioritize words ending in Y, containing S and P, and avoiding excluded letters.
   - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., G, I, L, D) to maximize information.
   - Avoid positions forbidden for S (1, 3) and P (1, 5).
   - Given the constraints, possible candidate words include:
     - **GIPSY**: Positions—G1, I2, P3, S4, Y5.  
       (S in position 4 and P in position 3 are allowed; tests G and I.)
     - **GYPSY**: Positions—G1, Y2, P3, S4, Y5.  
       (S in position 4 and P in position 3 are allowed; tests G and duplicate Y, which is less ideal for information gain.)
     - **DIPSY**: Positions—D1, I2, P3, S4, Y5.  
       (Similar to GIPSY but with D; less common word.)
   - **GIPSY is selected** because:
     - It uses distinct letters (no duplicates), ensuring clearer feedback.
     - It tests S in position 4 and P in position 3—new positions not yet evaluated.
     - It introduces two new common letters (G and I) from the remaining pool.
     - It is a valid English word (variant of ""gypsy"") and fits all constraints.",Guess 4: gipsy -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
