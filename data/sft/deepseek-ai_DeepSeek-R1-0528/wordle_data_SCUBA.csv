We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
  R: x (R is not in the secret word)
  A: - (A is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
  N: x (N is not in the secret word)
  E: x (E is not in the secret word)

 So, from this feedback we know:
  - The secret word contains the letters C and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
  - The secret word does not contain R, N, or E.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 Important: The secret word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 We know:
  - The word has a 'C' and an 'A', but not in the first and third positions (since in ""crane"", C was at position 1 and A at position 3, and they are marked as wrong position).
  - The word does not have R, N, E.

 We also note that the feedback for C and A being in the wrong position means they must appear elsewhere.

 Let's think of a word that:
  - Does not use R, N, E (so avoid these letters).
  - Includes C and A, but not in position 1 (for C) and not in position 3 (for A).

 Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Since we have two known letters (C and A) and three unknown positions, we can try to place C and A in different positions and use new letters for the rest.

 Possible positions for C: since it was in position 1 and that was wrong, it can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so it can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 But note: we cannot put C in position 1 again (because we know it's not there) and A cannot be in position 3.

 We also have to avoid the letters R, N, E.

 Let's try to form a word that has:
  - C in a position other than 1
  - A in a position other than 3

 And we want to use new letters to get more information.

 Common consonants without R, N, E: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 However, we also know that the word must have exactly one C and one A (unless there are duplicates, but we don't know that). But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates, so we have to be cautious.

 Since we only have two known letters, we might try to put C and A in positions that are common.

 Let me try to put C in position 2 and A in position 1? But wait, we don't know if A can be in position 1. Actually, it can because the feedback only said A was not in position 3.

 However, we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But without evidence, we assume no duplicates for now.

 Let's try to think of words that have C and A, and avoid R, N, E.

 Some words: 
  - ""CLAMP"": but L, M, P are new. But note: C is in position 1? We cannot put C in position 1. So we need to avoid that.

  - ""TRACK"": but T and K are new, but we have R? We cannot use R because we know R is not in the word. So invalid.

  - ""SCALP"": 
        S (new) at position 1, 
        C at position 2 (which is a new position for C, so allowed), 
        A at position 3? But wait, we cannot put A at position 3 because the feedback said A was in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A at position 3, that would be the same as before? Actually, the feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3, so we can try position 3 again? No, because if the word had A in position 3, it would have been marked as correct. But it was marked as wrong position, meaning the A is in the word but not at position 3. Therefore, we must avoid position 3 for A.

 So in ""SCALP"", if we put A at position 3, that would be invalid because we know A is not at position 3. Therefore, we cannot use A at position 3.

 We need a word that has A not in position 3 and C not in position 1.

 Let me try to put A at position 1 and C at position 4? For example, ""AUDIO"" doesn't have C. 

 Another idea: ""BACON"" -> but we cannot use N (because N is not in the word) and also we cannot use O? Wait, O is allowed because we haven't ruled it out. But we cannot use N. So ""BACON"" is invalid because of N.

 How about ""BASIC""? 
  - B (new) at 1, 
  - A at 2 (which is not position 3, so allowed), 
  - S (new) at 3, 
  - I (new) at 4, 
  - C at 5 (which is not position 1, so allowed).

 This word: BASIC
  - It has A at position 2 (not 3) and C at position 5 (not 1).
  - It avoids R, N, E.

 So let's consider ""BASIC"".

 But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have the letter C in a position we haven't tried? We are trying C at 5 and A at 2.

 Alternatively, we could try ""CACTI"" but that has two C's? And also C at position 1 is not allowed. So we cannot use C at position 1.

 Another word: ""MAGIC"" -> 
  M (new) at 1, 
  A at 2 (allowed), 
  G (new) at 3, 
  I (new) at 4, 
  C at 5 (allowed).

 This also works.

 But we want to maximize information. We have two known letters (C and A) and we are including them in new positions. We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Both ""BASIC"" and ""MAGIC"" are good. Let me choose one.

 However, note that the feedback for the first guess also told us that the word does not have R, N, E. So we are avoiding those.

 I think ""BASIC"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we can get more information.

 But wait: what if the secret word has a duplicate? We don't know. But we are assuming no duplicates for now.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't put both known letters at once? But that might be less efficient. We have two known letters, so we should use them to narrow down.

 However, we must also consider that the feedback might reveal more about the positions.

 Let me go with ""BASIC"".

 So the next guess: BASIC.

 But note: we are not sure if the secret word has B, S, or I. We are testing these.

 We are also placing A at position 2 and C at position 5.

 If the secret word has A at position 2, then we'll get a check for A. Similarly for C at position 5.

 If not, we might get a dash for A or C meaning they are in the word but not at that position.

 This will help us narrow down the positions.

 Therefore, I choose ""BASIC"".

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked with `-`).
- R, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with `x`).

For the next guess:
- Must include C and A, but avoid positions where they were incorrect (C not in position 1, A not in position 3).
- Must exclude R, N, and E entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (B, S, I) to gather more information.

The word ""BASIC"" fits these criteria:
- Places A in position 2 (new position, avoiding position 3).
- Places C in position 5 (new position, avoiding position 1).
- Uses new letters B, S, I (all valid and not excluded).
- Avoids R, N, E.

 Another idea: ""BACON"" -> but we cannot use N (because N is not in the word) and also we cannot use O? Wait, O is allowed because we haven't ruled it out. But we cannot use N. So ""BACON"" is invalid because of N.

 How about ""BASIC""? 
  - B (new) at 1, 
  - A at 2 (which is not position 3, so allowed), 
  - S (new) at 3, 
  - I (new) at 4, 
  - C at 5 (which is not position 1, so allowed).

 This word: BASIC
  - It has A at position 2 (not 3) and C at position 5 (not 1).
  - It avoids R, N, E.

 So let's consider ""BASIC"".

 But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have the letter C in a position we haven't tried? We are trying C at 5 and A at 2.

 Alternatively, we could try ""CACTI"" but that has two C's? And also C at position 1 is not allowed. So we cannot use C at position 1.

 Another word: ""MAGIC"" -> 
  M (new) at 1, 
  A at 2 (allowed), 
  G (new) at 3, 
  I (new) at 4, 
  C at 5 (allowed).

 This also works.

 But we want to maximize information. We have two known letters (C and A) and we are including them in new positions. We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Both ""BASIC"" and ""MAGIC"" are good. Let me choose one.

 However, note that the feedback for the first guess also told us that the word does not have R, N, E. So we are avoiding those.

 I think ""BASIC"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we can get more information.

 But wait: what if the secret word has a duplicate? We don't know. But we are assuming no duplicates for now.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't put both known letters at once? But that might be less efficient. We have two known letters, so we should use them to narrow down.

 However, we must also consider that the feedback might reveal more about the positions.

 Let me go with ""BASIC"".

 So the next guess: BASIC.

 But note: we are not sure if the secret word has B, S, or I. We are testing these.

 We are also placing A at position 2 and C at position 5.

 If the secret word has A at position 2, then we'll get a check for A. Similarly for C at position 5.

 If not, we might get a dash for A or C meaning they are in the word but not at that position.

 This will help us narrow down the positions.

 Therefore, I choose ""BASIC"".

<guess>basic</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked with `-`).
- R, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with `x`).

For the next guess:
- Must include C and A, but avoid positions where they were incorrect (C not in position 1, A not in position 3).
- Must exclude R, N, and E entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (B, S, I) to gather more information.

The word ""BASIC"" fits these criteria:
- Places A in position 2 (new position, avoiding position 3).
- Places C in position 5 (new position, avoiding position 1).
- Uses new letters B, S, I (all valid and not excluded).
- Avoids R, N, E.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of C and A while testing three new letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
- R, N, E are not in the secret word.

Second guess: ""basic"" -> Feedback: B(-) A(-) S(-) I(x) C(-)
Meaning:
- B is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- A is in the secret word but not in position 2 (because we tried A at position 2 and it got '-', meaning it's in the word but wrong position).
- S is in the secret word but not in position 3.
- I is not in the secret word (x).
- C is in the secret word but not in position 5.

So far, we know:
- The secret word contains: C, A, B, S. (because they got '-' or we know they are present)
- The secret word does not contain: R, N, E, I.

Also, we have information about incorrect positions for each of these letters.

Specifically:
- C: not in position 1 (from ""crane"") and not in position 5 (from ""basic""). So C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- A: not in position 3 (from ""crane"") and not in position 2 (from ""basic""). So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- B: not in position 1 (from ""basic"").
- S: not in position 3 (from ""basic"").

The secret word has 5 letters, and we know 4 of them: B, A, S, C. So only one letter is missing.

We also know the absent letters: R, N, E, I.

Since we have 4 known letters and only one unknown, we can try to form words that include these four letters and one additional letter that isn't excluded.

The unknown letter must be one that hasn't been tried yet and isn't in the absent list (R, N, E, I). We also know it must be an English letter.

We need to assign the positions for B, A, S, C respecting the constraints:

- C: in {2,3,4}
- A: in {1,4,5}
- B: not in 1, so in {2,3,4,5}
- S: not in 3, so in {1,2,4,5}

Moreover, each letter is in a distinct position.

The remaining positions: we have 5 positions. We know 4 letters, so we have one more letter to find for the remaining position.

But note: the word must have exactly these 4 letters and one more? Not necessarily: it could be that one of these letters appears twice? But we don't have evidence of duplicates. However, we have to consider that the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicate. Currently, we haven't guessed duplicates.

But let's recall: in ""basic"", we had B, A, S, C. The feedback showed all with '-' or 'x' except I which is absent. That means each of B, A, S, C is present at least once. But if there were duplicates, we wouldn't know. However, without any duplicate in our guesses, we assume the word has distinct letters for now.

But it's possible that the word has duplicate letters. However, our known letters are B, A, S, C and one other? Or perhaps one of them is duplicated.

But we only have four known distinct letters. Since we have feedback showing each one, we can assume that the word has at least one B, one A, one S, one C. And since we have one missing position, it could be one of these duplicated or a new letter.

Given that, we should consider both possibilities.

First, let's list the positions available:

Position 1: cannot be C (because not pos1), cannot be A? (we don't know, A can be in pos1). But we know that position 1 is not B (from ""basic"" feedback: B was in position1 and got '-', meaning B is not in pos1 but in the word). So position 1 must be either A, S, or the unknown letter.

Similarly, position 2: cannot be A? (because A not in pos2 per ""basic""), and cannot be C? (we don't know, C can be in pos2). Actually, C can be in pos2.

Let me make a table of forbidden positions per letter:

- B: forbidden pos: 1
- A: forbidden pos: 2,3
- S: forbidden pos: 3
- C: forbidden pos: 1,5

And we have absent letters: R, N, E, I.

Now, the word must have exactly these 4 letters and one more letter? Or duplicates? Since we have 5 positions and 4 known distinct letters, there must be one duplicate or one new letter.

But we can consider that one of the known letters is duplicated. Alternatively, there is a fifth distinct letter.

To be efficient, we can try to find a word that fits these constraints.

Let me denote the secret word as _ _ _ _ _

We know the word contains B, A, S, C and one more of the remaining letters (except R, N, E, I).

The available letters are: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we don't know which one.

Alternatively, the word has a duplicate of one of B, A, S, C? But that might be rare? We should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary.

So let's first assume the word has a fifth distinct letter.

Then, we have five distinct letters: B, A, S, C, and X (unknown).

We need to assign:

- Position 1: cannot be B, cannot be C. So must be A, S, or X.
- Position 2: cannot be A. So must be B, S, C, or X.
- Position 3: cannot be A, cannot be S. So must be B, C, or X.
- Position 4: no restrictions? Only for C: C must be in 2,3,4? But position 4 is allowed for C? Yes.
- Position 5: cannot be C. So must be A (if not duplicated, but A might be duplicated?), B, S, or X.

But wait, A can be in position 5? Yes, because A only forbidden positions are 2 and 3.

Similarly, S can be in position 5? Yes.

Now, we also have constraints about presence. Since only one letter is unknown, we can try possibilities.

But we have two guesses left? Wait, no: we have had two guesses so far, so 4 tries left.

But to maximize information, we might choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible? But we already know 4 letters, so the main thing is to find the positions.

But we have one unknown. So we need to discover the unknown letter.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses the known letters and one new letter that is common.

First, let's see possible positions.

Since C must be in 2,3,4, and not in 1,5.

Similarly, A must be in 1,4,5.

But if A is in 1, then:

- Pos1 = A
- Then pos4 and pos5 cannot be A? Or can they? If there is a duplicate. But for now, no duplicate.

So it's better to assume distinct.

Assume distinct:

Case 1: A in position 1.
Then:
- Pos1 = A
- For C: must be in 2,3,4.
- For S: cannot be in position 3, so S can be in 2,4,5.
- For B: cannot be in 1, so in 2,3,4,5.

Also, the fifth letter X in a free position.

But then we have positions 2,3,4,5 for B, C, S, X.

Moreover, pos3: cannot be A (but A is already at 1) or S? Cannot be S? S is not forbidden from pos3? Wait, no: S is forbidden in position 3? Wait, no: S got '-' in position 3 in ""basic"", meaning S is in the word but not at position 3. So S cannot be at position 3.

Similarly, A cannot be at position 3, but in this case A is at 1.

So for pos3: cannot be S, and cannot be A (but A is not here). Wait, the constraint is per letter, not per position. Position 3 can be any letter except if that letter has a constraint. But S cannot be at position 3. So position 3 must be B, C, or X.

Similarly, C can be in 2,3,4.

Let's assign positions.

If pos1 = A, then:
- Position 1: A
- Now position 5: A cannot be at position 5? No, because if distinct, A can only be at 1.

But we have only one A? We assumed distinct.

So A must be in 1 and only at 1.

Then:
  pos1 = A
  C must be in 2,3,4
  S must be in 1,2,4,5? But pos1 is taken, so S in 2,4,5 but not 3.
  B must be in 2,3,4,5.

And one position for X.

Now, let's consider possible words.

For example, a word with A at position 1: 
  - S cannot be at 3, C must be at 2,3, or 4.

List possible:

- If C at pos2: 
    A _ C _ _   -> but we have S, B, X to assign to pos3,4,5.
    But S cannot be at pos3. So S must be at pos4 or 5.
    B and X at the others.

Example: A B C S X? But S at 4, X at 5? But X missing.

We need actual words.

How about ""A B C U S""? But that has 5 letters: positions:
  1: A
  2: B
  3: C -> but wait, S cannot be at pos3? We didn't put S at 3? Here we put C at 3 and S at 5.
But then ""abcus""? Is that a word? I think ""abcus"" is not a word. 

Similar, ""abscess"" is too long.

Let me think of common words.

Alternative: what if C is at position 4?

Then: A _ _, C, _

We need to fill pos2,3,5 with B, S, and X?

And S cannot be at position 3.

So S can be at 2 or 5.

If S at position 2:
   A S _ C _

Then position 3 must be B or X? But not S, and not A (taken), not C (taken). So B or X.

Position 5 must be B or X.

Words: 
- If pos3 = B, pos5 = X: ""A S B C X"" -> is ""asbc"" something? No.
- If pos3 = X, pos5 = B: ""A S X C B"" -> not clear.

If S at position 5:
   A _ _ C S

Then position 2 and 3: B and X? Also, position 3 must not be S (but S is at 5) and not A or C? So B or X.

Position 2: B, X

Position 3: must be B, C, or X? But C is at 4? So position 3 must be B or X.

Words:
  If pos2=B, pos3=X: ""A B X C S"" -> not a word? 
  ""abacs""? Not.
  ""abbcs""? Not.

Not working.

Case: A not at position 1.

Then A must be in position 4 or 5.

Similarly, we can try other cases.

Given the complexity, perhaps we can try a word that uses the known letters and a common new letter.

We know the word has B, A, S, C and one more.

The new letter must not be R, N, E, I.

Very common letters: T, O, L, etc.

We also need to respect the position constraints.

Or, we can try to guess a word that uses B, A, S, C and for example T.

Let me list words that include B, A, S, C and another letter.

For example: ""SCARB"" -> but this has R, which is disallowed.

""SCABY""? Not common.

""BACKS"": 
  Positions: B at 1, A at 2, C at 3, K at 4, S at 5.
But wait:
  In ""basic"" we learned that B is not at position 1? But in ""BACKS"", B is at position 1? That's not allowed because we know B is in the word but not at position 1.

So ""BACKS"" would have B at pos1, which is incorrect.

""BASIC"" we already guessed? And it has B at 1, which is a wrong position secret.

We need B not at 1.

So let's make a word that has B somewhere else.

For example: ""S C A B S"" — duplicate S? Or ""C A B A S"" — duplicate A.

But let's avoid duplicates.

So: ""S C A B ?"" or ""C A B S ?""

But C cannot be at position 1? In ""backs"", C is at 3, but B is at 1 which is forbidden.

Alternative: ""SCABS"" has S at 1, C at 2, A at 3, B at 4, S at 5 — but two S's. Plus, A is at pos3 which is forbidden? Because in ""crane"", A got '-' at pos3, and from ""basic"", A got '-' at pos2, so A cannot be at pos3? Exactly, A cannot be at pos3. But ""scabs"" has A at 3? Oh, so it cannot be.

""A B S C ?"" but A cannot be at pos2? Because from ""basic"" we know A cannot be at pos2.

This is tricky.

Another idea: ""O A S I S"" but has I, which is disallowed? I is x in ""basic"", so I is not in the word. Also has duplicate S.

Let's think of common words including B, A, S, C.

Perhaps ""SCALB"" — not a word.
""SCAB"" — too short.
""BASIC"" is already guessed.

How about ""BANCS"" — but N is not allowed.

Or ""BALSA"" — but L? Also, check: 
  B at 1: not allowed because B cannot be at 1.
  A at 2: not allowed because A cannot be at pos2? In ""balsa"", if we put A at pos2, but we know A is not at pos2? From ""basic"", A at pos2 got '-', meaning it's not there. So if we try A at pos2 again, it will be wrong.

But in ""BALSA"", if we guess it, it would be:
  B at pos1 (forbidden for B), A at pos2 (forbidden for A), L new, S at pos4, A at pos5 (duplicate).

Not ideal.

Another word: ""CABAS"" — but C at pos1 forbidden? C cannot be at pos1. 

C at 1: not allowed.

Perhaps ""BASSC"" — but duplicate S and C, and B at1 not allowed.

Maybe we try a word that has C and A in allowed positions and B and S.

Let me: C must be in 2,3,4. So assume C at pos2.

Then word: _ C _ _ _

A cannot be at 2 or 3. So A can be at 1,4,5.

But if C is at2, then A cannot be at2? But that's fine.

Suppose A at pos1: then A C _ _ _

Then S cannot be at pos3. Also, B cannot be at pos1? Already taken.

Also, position 3 must be B, X, or S? But S cannot be at3? Also, we have S to place.

Positions available: 3,4,5.

We have to place B and S and one letter.

But S cannot be at3, so S can be at4 or5.

B can be anywhere except1.

So let's say:

If A C _ S _   or  A C _ _ S

For example:

- A C _ S _ : then pos4=S, pos3 and pos5: B and X? But S is at4.

Or A C _ _ S: then pos3 and pos4: B and X.

But position 3: cannot be S? But S is not at3. It can be B or X, but not S? The constraint is that S cannot be at3, but it doesn't have to be at3.

So position 3 can be B or X.

Also, the letter at position 3 must be B or c or x? Wait, no constraint for letter on position itself.

So let's think:

- Secret word starting with ""AC"", and then 3 positions.

Common words: ""ACROSS"" — too long.

""ACIDS"" — I disallowed.

""ACKED"" — E disallowed.

""ACTS"" — too short/

 or ""ACYCLIC"" — too long.

 ""ACORN"" — but N disallowed.

Another possibility: C at position 3.

Then word: _ _ C _ _

C at pos3 is allowed because C can be at 2,3,4.

Then A: can be at1,4,5.

But we have to avoid A at2 and3.

Similarly.

For example, A at1: then A _ C _ _

 then positions 2,4,5.

Position 2: can be B, S, or X? But S cannot be at3? We are not putting S at3; but we can put S at2? Yes.

Similarly.

Then ""A _ C _ _""

We need B and S and one more.

Also, S cannot be at position 3? Already taken by C, so it's safe.

S can be at 2,4,5.

B can be at 2,4,5.

And X at the remaining.

But position: we have position 2,4,5 for B, S, X.

Words like:
 ""A B C D S"" and D disallowed? We can use D.
 ""A B C S D"" ? ""abc-s"" words are rare.

Maybe ""A B C U S"" but not word.

With S in position 4: ""A _ C S ?"" 
 for example ""B C S"" at 2,4,5? Then ""ABACS"" not word.

How about ""A t c a s"" — then A is duplicated? And a at4 and5.

Let's list actual words.

Perhaps I am missing: maybe the word has a duplicate?

For example, ""class"" has two S's.

Or ""scabs"" has S and B.

But then B in the word is only once, etc.

Another thought: from the feedback from ""basic"", we have:
 B in the word but not at pos1 -> should be in 2,3,4,5
 A in the word not at pos2 -> should be in 1,3,4,5 -> but A cannot be at pos3? From ""crane"" feedback, A is not at pos3. So we must remove pos3 for A? A cannot be at 2 or 3, but can be at 1,4,5.

Similarly, S not at pos3, so at 1,2,4,5.

C not at pos1 or 5, so at 2,3,4.

Now, let's try to form a word we know.

Common words with these letters: ""BASIC"" already guessed, and it gave us feedback.

Another word: ""CASBA"" — but C at1 not allowed, and also it's not common.

Or "" C a S B a "" — duplicate A.

Perhaps focus on the possibility of A at position 5.

So A at5: then the word: _ _ _ _ A

 C must be in 2,3,4.

Similarly, B: cannot be at1, so at2,3,4? Because pos1 is now available.

 S cannot be at3, so at1,2,4.

Also, the first position can be S, B, or X? But B cannot be at1? Or can it? B cannot be at position 1? Because in ""basic"", B at position1 got '-', meaning B is in the word but not at pos1. So B can be in 2,3,4,5. But pos5 is A, so B can be in 2,3,4.

 S can be at1,2,4.

 C must be in 2,3,4.

So for positions 1,2,3,4:

 and the fifth is A at5.

But we have to place B, S, C and one X.

Positions 1,2,3,4 to be filled by B, S, C, and X.

Posns:

 1: must be only S or X? Because B cannot be at1.

 2: any
 3: cannot be S? S cannot at3, so if S is at3, not good. S is only at1,2,4.
    Also, position 3 can be B, C, or X.
 4: any

So for example:
 - If pos1 = S: then ""S _ _ _ A""
   then positions 2,3,4: B, C, and X?.

   But S at1 is allowed.

   Now, position 3: cannot be S (already used), can be B, C, or X.

   Also, position 2: B, C, X, etc.

   Words like: ""S T C B A"" and T is allowed? But is it a word? ""stcba"" not a word.

   ""S C A B A"" but duplicate A.

   ""S C B L A"" -> ""scbla"" not word.

   ""S A B C A"" -> duplicate A, and A at2? A cannot be at2? From ""basic"", A at2 is forbidden.

   So cannot have A at2.

   So the only possibilities for A are at4 and 5.

   But pos5 is A, so no other A.

   So no duplicate.

   Therefore, the word is ""S _ _ _ A"", and the middle three must be B, C, and X, with X new letter.

   Also, position 3 can be B or C or X.

   But if position 2 is not C, then C must be at position 3 or 4.

   Similarly, B must be at2,3,4.

   Also, position 3 cannot be S? But S is at1, so it's fine.

   So let's see if we can find known words:

   ""S O C B A"" -> ""socba"" not word.

   ""S C L A M"" -> but positions: if ""S C L A M"", then A at4? But pos5 is M? We assumed A at5, so contradiction.

   Ah, I think I forgot: if A is at position 5, then it can't be at any other.

   common words ending with A: Many.

   With letters B,C,S and one more.

   Like ""scuba"" -> positions:
     S at1, C at2, U new, B at4, A at5.

   This word: ""scuba""

   Check against constraints:
     B at4: allowed? B can be at4.
     A at5: allowed.
     C at2: allowed? C must be in 2,3,4 — yes.
     S at1: allowed? S can be at1,2,4,5 — at1 is valid.
     U is new letter, not in absent list.

 Also, no letter in forbidden position:
   - A is at5, not pos2 or3 — good.
   - C at2, not pos1 or5 — good.
   - S at1, not pos3 — good.
   - B at4, not pos1 — good.

 So ""scuba"" is a valid English word.

 Moreover, it does not use any of the to-be-avoided letters (R, N, E, I), and has distinct letters.

 Let's verify the feedback we would get if it were the secret word: 
   But we are not saying it's the secret, we are guessing it.

 This guess will help us confirm or deny.

 Another possibility: ""cobra"" but C at1 not allowed.

 ""tabla"" has T and L, but does it have C? No.

 ""scuba"" seems good.

 Other words: ""scuta"" is or ""butا"" not.

 let's go with ""scuba"".

 So guess: scuba

 This guess has the known letters: S, C, U (new), B, A.

 And U is a new letter that we can test.

 If U is the missing letter, then great.

 If not, we may get feedback with x for U or more clues.

 Therefore, I choose ""scuba"".

<guess>scuba</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - R, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""basic"" → Feedback: B(-) A(-) S(-) I(x) C(-)**  
  - B is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - S is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - C is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - I is not in the word.  

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters present**: B, A, S, C.  
- **Absent letters**: R, N, E, I.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - C: Cannot be in positions 1 or 5 → must be in 2, 3, or 4.  
  - A: Cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
  - B: Cannot be in position 1 → must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
  - S: Cannot be in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
- The word has exactly 5 letters, so the fifth letter is unknown and cannot be R, N, E, or I.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The goal is to test possible positions for the known letters (B, A, S, C) while introducing a new common letter (e.g., U) to gather more position information.  
- Given the constraints, ""scuba"" is a valid guess:  
  - It places S in position 1 (allowed), C in position 2 (allowed per C constraints), U (new), B in position 4 (allowed), and A in position 5 (allowed per A constraints).  
  - It avoids R, N, E, I and tests U, a new untested letter.  
- This guess will provide feedback to refine the position of each letter and confirm/deny U's presence.  

<guess>scuba</guess>",scuba,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
- R, N, E are not in the secret word.

Second guess: ""basic"" -> Feedback: B(-) A(-) S(-) I(x) C(-)
Meaning:
- B is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- A is in the secret word but not in position 2 (because we tried A at position 2 and it got '-', meaning it's in the word but wrong position).
- S is in the secret word but not in position 3.
- I is not in the secret word (x).
- C is in the secret word but not in position 5.

So far, we know:
- The secret word contains: C, A, B, S. (because they got '-' or we know they are present)
- The secret word does not contain: R, N, E, I.

Also, we have information about incorrect positions for each of these letters.

Specifically:
- C: not in position 1 (from ""crane"") and not in position 5 (from ""basic""). So C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- A: not in position 3 (from ""crane"") and not in position 2 (from ""basic""). So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- B: not in position 1 (from ""basic"").
- S: not in position 3 (from ""basic"").

The secret word has 5 letters, and we know 4 of them: B, A, S, C. So only one letter is missing.

We also know the absent letters: R, N, E, I.

Since we have 4 known letters and only one unknown, we can try to form words that include these four letters and one additional letter that isn't excluded.

The unknown letter must be one that hasn't been tried yet and isn't in the absent list (R, N, E, I). We also know it must be an English letter.

We need to assign the positions for B, A, S, C respecting the constraints:

- C: in {2,3,4}
- A: in {1,4,5}
- B: not in 1, so in {2,3,4,5}
- S: not in 3, so in {1,2,4,5}

Moreover, each letter is in a distinct position.

The remaining positions: we have 5 positions. We know 4 letters, so we have one more letter to find for the remaining position.

But note: the word must have exactly these 4 letters and one more? Not necessarily: it could be that one of these letters appears twice? But we don't have evidence of duplicates. However, we have to consider that the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicate. Currently, we haven't guessed duplicates.

But let's recall: in ""basic"", we had B, A, S, C. The feedback showed all with '-' or 'x' except I which is absent. That means each of B, A, S, C is present at least once. But if there were duplicates, we wouldn't know. However, without any duplicate in our guesses, we assume the word has distinct letters for now.

But it's possible that the word has duplicate letters. However, our known letters are B, A, S, C and one other? Or perhaps one of them is duplicated.

But we only have four known distinct letters. Since we have feedback showing each one, we can assume that the word has at least one B, one A, one S, one C. And since we have one missing position, it could be one of these duplicated or a new letter.

Given that, we should consider both possibilities.

First, let's list the positions available:

Position 1: cannot be C (because not pos1), cannot be A? (we don't know, A can be in pos1). But we know that position 1 is not B (from ""basic"" feedback: B was in position1 and got '-', meaning B is not in pos1 but in the word). So position 1 must be either A, S, or the unknown letter.

Similarly, position 2: cannot be A? (because A not in pos2 per ""basic""), and cannot be C? (we don't know, C can be in pos2). Actually, C can be in pos2.

Let me make a table of forbidden positions per letter:

- B: forbidden pos: 1
- A: forbidden pos: 2,3
- S: forbidden pos: 3
- C: forbidden pos: 1,5

And we have absent letters: R, N, E, I.

Now, the word must have exactly these 4 letters and one more letter? Or duplicates? Since we have 5 positions and 4 known distinct letters, there must be one duplicate or one new letter.

But we can consider that one of the known letters is duplicated. Alternatively, there is a fifth distinct letter.

To be efficient, we can try to find a word that fits these constraints.

Let me denote the secret word as _ _ _ _ _

We know the word contains B, A, S, C and one more of the remaining letters (except R, N, E, I).

The available letters are: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we don't know which one.

Alternatively, the word has a duplicate of one of B, A, S, C? But that might be rare? We should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary.

So let's first assume the word has a fifth distinct letter.

Then, we have five distinct letters: B, A, S, C, and X (unknown).

We need to assign:

- Position 1: cannot be B, cannot be C. So must be A, S, or X.
- Position 2: cannot be A. So must be B, S, C, or X.
- Position 3: cannot be A, cannot be S. So must be B, C, or X.
- Position 4: no restrictions? Only for C: C must be in 2,3,4? But position 4 is allowed for C? Yes.
- Position 5: cannot be C. So must be A (if not duplicated, but A might be duplicated?), B, S, or X.

But wait, A can be in position 5? Yes, because A only forbidden positions are 2 and 3.

Similarly, S can be in position 5? Yes.

Now, we also have constraints about presence. Since only one letter is unknown, we can try possibilities.

But we have two guesses left? Wait, no: we have had two guesses so far, so 4 tries left.

But to maximize information, we might choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible? But we already know 4 letters, so the main thing is to find the positions.

But we have one unknown. So we need to discover the unknown letter.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses the known letters and one new letter that is common.

First, let's see possible positions.

Since C must be in 2,3,4, and not in 1,5.

Similarly, A must be in 1,4,5.

But if A is in 1, then:

- Pos1 = A
- Then pos4 and pos5 cannot be A? Or can they? If there is a duplicate. But for now, no duplicate.

So it's better to assume distinct.

Assume distinct:

Case 1: A in position 1.
Then:
- Pos1 = A
- For C: must be in 2,3,4.
- For S: cannot be in position 3, so S can be in 2,4,5.
- For B: cannot be in 1, so in 2,3,4,5.

Also, the fifth letter X in a free position.

But then we have positions 2,3,4,5 for B, C, S, X.

Moreover, pos3: cannot be A (but A is already at 1) or S? Cannot be S? S is not forbidden from pos3? Wait, no: S is forbidden in position 3? Wait, no: S got '-' in position 3 in ""basic"", meaning S is in the word but not at position 3. So S cannot be at position 3.

Similarly, A cannot be at position 3, but in this case A is at 1.

So for pos3: cannot be S, and cannot be A (but A is not here). Wait, the constraint is per letter, not per position. Position 3 can be any letter except if that letter has a constraint. But S cannot be at position 3. So position 3 must be B, C, or X.

Similarly, C can be in 2,3,4.

Let's assign positions.

If pos1 = A, then:
- Position 1: A
- Now position 5: A cannot be at position 5? No, because if distinct, A can only be at 1.

But we have only one A? We assumed distinct.

So A must be in 1 and only at 1.

Then:
  pos1 = A
  C must be in 2,3,4
  S must be in 1,2,4,5? But pos1 is taken, so S in 2,4,5 but not 3.
  B must be in 2,3,4,5.

And one position for X.

Now, let's consider possible words.

For example, a word with A at position 1: 
  - S cannot be at 3, C must be at 2,3, or 4.

List possible:

- If C at pos2: 
    A _ C _ _   -> but we have S, B, X to assign to pos3,4,5.
    But S cannot be at pos3. So S must be at pos4 or 5.
    B and X at the others.

Example: A B C S X? But S at 4, X at 5? But X missing.

We need actual words.

How about ""A B C U S""? But that has 5 letters: positions:
  1: A
  2: B
  3: C -> but wait, S cannot be at pos3? We didn't put S at 3? Here we put C at 3 and S at 5.
But then ""abcus""? Is that a word? I think ""abcus"" is not a word. 

Similar, ""abscess"" is too long.

Let me think of common words.

Alternative: what if C is at position 4?

Then: A _ _, C, _

We need to fill pos2,3,5 with B, S, and X?

And S cannot be at position 3.

So S can be at 2 or 5.

If S at position 2:
   A S _ C _

Then position 3 must be B or X? But not S, and not A (taken), not C (taken). So B or X.

Position 5 must be B or X.

Words: 
- If pos3 = B, pos5 = X: ""A S B C X"" -> is ""asbc"" something? No.
- If pos3 = X, pos5 = B: ""A S X C B"" -> not clear.

If S at position 5:
   A _ _ C S

Then position 2 and 3: B and X? Also, position 3 must not be S (but S is at 5) and not A or C? So B or X.

Position 2: B, X

Position 3: must be B, C, or X? But C is at 4? So position 3 must be B or X.

Words:
  If pos2=B, pos3=X: ""A B X C S"" -> not a word? 
  ""abacs""? Not.
  ""abbcs""? Not.

Not working.

Case: A not at position 1.

Then A must be in position 4 or 5.

Similarly, we can try other cases.

Given the complexity, perhaps we can try a word that uses the known letters and a common new letter.

We know the word has B, A, S, C and one more.

The new letter must not be R, N, E, I.

Very common letters: T, O, L, etc.

We also need to respect the position constraints.

Or, we can try to guess a word that uses B, A, S, C and for example T.

Let me list words that include B, A, S, C and another letter.

For example: ""SCARB"" -> but this has R, which is disallowed.

""SCABY""? Not common.

""BACKS"": 
  Positions: B at 1, A at 2, C at 3, K at 4, S at 5.
But wait:
  In ""basic"" we learned that B is not at position 1? But in ""BACKS"", B is at position 1? That's not allowed because we know B is in the word but not at position 1.

So ""BACKS"" would have B at pos1, which is incorrect.

""BASIC"" we already guessed? And it has B at 1, which is a wrong position secret.

We need B not at 1.

So let's make a word that has B somewhere else.

For example: ""S C A B S"" — duplicate S? Or ""C A B A S"" — duplicate A.

But let's avoid duplicates.

So: ""S C A B ?"" or ""C A B S ?""

But C cannot be at position 1? In ""backs"", C is at 3, but B is at 1 which is forbidden.

Alternative: ""SCABS"" has S at 1, C at 2, A at 3, B at 4, S at 5 — but two S's. Plus, A is at pos3 which is forbidden? Because in ""crane"", A got '-' at pos3, and from ""basic"", A got '-' at pos2, so A cannot be at pos3? Exactly, A cannot be at pos3. But ""scabs"" has A at 3? Oh, so it cannot be.

""A B S C ?"" but A cannot be at pos2? Because from ""basic"" we know A cannot be at pos2.

This is tricky.

Another idea: ""O A S I S"" but has I, which is disallowed? I is x in ""basic"", so I is not in the word. Also has duplicate S.

Let's think of common words including B, A, S, C.

Perhaps ""SCALB"" — not a word.
""SCAB"" — too short.
""BASIC"" is already guessed.

How about ""BANCS"" — but N is not allowed.

Or ""BALSA"" — but L? Also, check: 
  B at 1: not allowed because B cannot be at 1.
  A at 2: not allowed because A cannot be at pos2? In ""balsa"", if we put A at pos2, but we know A is not at pos2? From ""basic"", A at pos2 got '-', meaning it's not there. So if we try A at pos2 again, it will be wrong.

But in ""BALSA"", if we guess it, it would be:
  B at pos1 (forbidden for B), A at pos2 (forbidden for A), L new, S at pos4, A at pos5 (duplicate).

Not ideal.

Another word: ""CABAS"" — but C at pos1 forbidden? C cannot be at pos1. 

C at 1: not allowed.

Perhaps ""BASSC"" — but duplicate S and C, and B at1 not allowed.

Maybe we try a word that has C and A in allowed positions and B and S.

Let me: C must be in 2,3,4. So assume C at pos2.

Then word: _ C _ _ _

A cannot be at 2 or 3. So A can be at 1,4,5.

But if C is at2, then A cannot be at2? But that's fine.

Suppose A at pos1: then A C _ _ _

Then S cannot be at pos3. Also, B cannot be at pos1? Already taken.

Also, position 3 must be B, X, or S? But S cannot be at3? Also, we have S to place.

Positions available: 3,4,5.

We have to place B and S and one letter.

But S cannot be at3, so S can be at4 or5.

B can be anywhere except1.

So let's say:

If A C _ S _   or  A C _ _ S

For example:

- A C _ S _ : then pos4=S, pos3 and pos5: B and X? But S is at4.

Or A C _ _ S: then pos3 and pos4: B and X.

But position 3: cannot be S? But S is not at3. It can be B or X, but not S? The constraint is that S cannot be at3, but it doesn't have to be at3.

So position 3 can be B or X.

Also, the letter at position 3 must be B or c or x? Wait, no constraint for letter on position itself.

So let's think:

- Secret word starting with ""AC"", and then 3 positions.

Common words: ""ACROSS"" — too long.

""ACIDS"" — I disallowed.

""ACKED"" — E disallowed.

""ACTS"" — too short/

 or ""ACYCLIC"" — too long.

 ""ACORN"" — but N disallowed.

Another possibility: C at position 3.

Then word: _ _ C _ _

C at pos3 is allowed because C can be at 2,3,4.

Then A: can be at1,4,5.

But we have to avoid A at2 and3.

Similarly.

For example, A at1: then A _ C _ _

 then positions 2,4,5.

Position 2: can be B, S, or X? But S cannot be at3? We are not putting S at3; but we can put S at2? Yes.

Similarly.

Then ""A _ C _ _""

We need B and S and one more.

Also, S cannot be at position 3? Already taken by C, so it's safe.

S can be at 2,4,5.

B can be at 2,4,5.

And X at the remaining.

But position: we have position 2,4,5 for B, S, X.

Words like:
 ""A B C D S"" and D disallowed? We can use D.
 ""A B C S D"" ? ""abc-s"" words are rare.

Maybe ""A B C U S"" but not word.

With S in position 4: ""A _ C S ?"" 
 for example ""B C S"" at 2,4,5? Then ""ABACS"" not word.

How about ""A t c a s"" — then A is duplicated? And a at4 and5.

Let's list actual words.

Perhaps I am missing: maybe the word has a duplicate?

For example, ""class"" has two S's.

Or ""scabs"" has S and B.

But then B in the word is only once, etc.

Another thought: from the feedback from ""basic"", we have:
 B in the word but not at pos1 -> should be in 2,3,4,5
 A in the word not at pos2 -> should be in 1,3,4,5 -> but A cannot be at pos3? From ""crane"" feedback, A is not at pos3. So we must remove pos3 for A? A cannot be at 2 or 3, but can be at 1,4,5.

Similarly, S not at pos3, so at 1,2,4,5.

C not at pos1 or 5, so at 2,3,4.

Now, let's try to form a word we know.

Common words with these letters: ""BASIC"" already guessed, and it gave us feedback.

Another word: ""CASBA"" — but C at1 not allowed, and also it's not common.

Or "" C a S B a "" — duplicate A.

Perhaps focus on the possibility of A at position 5.

So A at5: then the word: _ _ _ _ A

 C must be in 2,3,4.

Similarly, B: cannot be at1, so at2,3,4? Because pos1 is now available.

 S cannot be at3, so at1,2,4.

Also, the first position can be S, B, or X? But B cannot be at1? Or can it? B cannot be at position 1? Because in ""basic"", B at position1 got '-', meaning B is in the word but not at pos1. So B can be in 2,3,4,5. But pos5 is A, so B can be in 2,3,4.

 S can be at1,2,4.

 C must be in 2,3,4.

So for positions 1,2,3,4:

 and the fifth is A at5.

But we have to place B, S, C and one X.

Positions 1,2,3,4 to be filled by B, S, C, and X.

Posns:

 1: must be only S or X? Because B cannot be at1.

 2: any
 3: cannot be S? S cannot at3, so if S is at3, not good. S is only at1,2,4.
    Also, position 3 can be B, C, or X.
 4: any

So for example:
 - If pos1 = S: then ""S _ _ _ A""
   then positions 2,3,4: B, C, and X?.

   But S at1 is allowed.

   Now, position 3: cannot be S (already used), can be B, C, or X.

   Also, position 2: B, C, X, etc.

   Words like: ""S T C B A"" and T is allowed? But is it a word? ""stcba"" not a word.

   ""S C A B A"" but duplicate A.

   ""S C B L A"" -> ""scbla"" not word.

   ""S A B C A"" -> duplicate A, and A at2? A cannot be at2? From ""basic"", A at2 is forbidden.

   So cannot have A at2.

   So the only possibilities for A are at4 and 5.

   But pos5 is A, so no other A.

   So no duplicate.

   Therefore, the word is ""S _ _ _ A"", and the middle three must be B, C, and X, with X new letter.

   Also, position 3 can be B or C or X.

   But if position 2 is not C, then C must be at position 3 or 4.

   Similarly, B must be at2,3,4.

   Also, position 3 cannot be S? But S is at1, so it's fine.

   So let's see if we can find known words:

   ""S O C B A"" -> ""socba"" not word.

   ""S C L A M"" -> but positions: if ""S C L A M"", then A at4? But pos5 is M? We assumed A at5, so contradiction.

   Ah, I think I forgot: if A is at position 5, then it can't be at any other.

   common words ending with A: Many.

   With letters B,C,S and one more.

   Like ""scuba"" -> positions:
     S at1, C at2, U new, B at4, A at5.

   This word: ""scuba""

   Check against constraints:
     B at4: allowed? B can be at4.
     A at5: allowed.
     C at2: allowed? C must be in 2,3,4 — yes.
     S at1: allowed? S can be at1,2,4,5 — at1 is valid.
     U is new letter, not in absent list.

 Also, no letter in forbidden position:
   - A is at5, not pos2 or3 — good.
   - C at2, not pos1 or5 — good.
   - S at1, not pos3 — good.
   - B at4, not pos1 — good.

 So ""scuba"" is a valid English word.

 Moreover, it does not use any of the to-be-avoided letters (R, N, E, I), and has distinct letters.

 Let's verify the feedback we would get if it were the secret word: 
   But we are not saying it's the secret, we are guessing it.

 This guess will help us confirm or deny.

 Another possibility: ""cobra"" but C at1 not allowed.

 ""tabla"" has T and L, but does it have C? No.

 ""scuba"" seems good.

 Other words: ""scuta"" is or ""butا"" not.

 let's go with ""scuba"".

 So guess: scuba

 This guess has the known letters: S, C, U (new), B, A.

 And U is a new letter that we can test.

 If U is the missing letter, then great.

 If not, we may get feedback with x for U or more clues.

 Therefore, I choose ""scuba"".

<guess>scuba</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - R, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""basic"" → Feedback: B(-) A(-) S(-) I(x) C(-)**  
  - B is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - S is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - C is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - I is not in the word.  

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters present**: B, A, S, C.  
- **Absent letters**: R, N, E, I.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - C: Cannot be in positions 1 or 5 → must be in 2, 3, or 4.  
  - A: Cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
  - B: Cannot be in position 1 → must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
  - S: Cannot be in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
- The word has exactly 5 letters, so the fifth letter is unknown and cannot be R, N, E, or I.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The goal is to test possible positions for the known letters (B, A, S, C) while introducing a new common letter (e.g., U) to gather more position information.  
- Given the constraints, ""scuba"" is a valid guess:  
  - It places S in position 1 (allowed), C in position 2 (allowed per C constraints), U (new), B in position 4 (allowed), and A in position 5 (allowed per A constraints).  
  - It avoids R, N, E, I and tests U, a new untested letter.  
- This guess will provide feedback to refine the position of each letter and confirm/deny U's presence.",Guess 3: scuba -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(✓) U(✓) B(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
