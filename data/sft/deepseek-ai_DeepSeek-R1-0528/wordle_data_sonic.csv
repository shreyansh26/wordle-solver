We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 This means:
 - C is present in the secret word but not in the first position (since it's marked with - meaning wrong position).
 - R is not in the word at all (x).
 - A is not in the word (x).
 - N is present but not in the fourth position (wrong position).
 - E is not in the word (x).

 So, we know:
   The secret word contains C and N, but not R, A, E.
   C is not in position 1 (since we had C in position 1 and it's marked wrong position, so it must be in another position).
   Similarly, N is not in position 4.

 The secret word is 5 letters long and must include C and N, and exclude R, A, E.

 Since R, A, E are not present, we can eliminate words containing these letters.

 Now, let's think about possible positions for C and N.
 Possible positions for C: It cannot be in position 1. So it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, N cannot be in position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and includes C and N (at least) but we don't know if there are other letters.

 Since we have two marked as present (C and N) and three absent (R, A, E), the word has at least these two letters.

 We need to make a second guess that:
   - Does not contain R, A, E.
   - Contains C and N (since they are present, we might want to try them in different positions).
   - Also, we try to include other common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 But note: we don't know what other letters are in the word, so we should try to test new common letters.

 Let me list the vowels we haven't tried: O, U, I (since A and E are out, and we know E is out). We also have consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we have two letters we know (C and N) and we want to test other common letters, we can form a word that has C and N in positions different from the first guess and include other common consonants and vowels.

 Important: In the feedback, the letters that are absent (R, A, E) we must avoid.

 Let me try to think of words that have C and N, and no R, A, E.

 Also, note that C was originally in position 1 and now we know it's not position 1, so we can try C in a different position.

 Similarly, N was in position 4 and that is wrong, so we should put N in a different position.

 Example positions: Let's put C in position 2 and N in position 5? Or maybe position 3?

 We can choose a word that has:
   - C in position 2 (since position 1 is forbidden for C) and N in position 3? But note: we must avoid positions that we know are wrong for each specific letter.

 However, note the feedback only tells us that C is not in position 1 and N is not in position 4. They could be anywhere else.

 Let me try to form words:

 Common words with C and N: ""lunch"", ""bench"", ""pinch"", ""conch"", etc.

 But we have to avoid R, A, E. Also, we must consider the missing letters.

 Since E is absent, words ending with E are out? But also avoid A and R.

 Let's consider:

   Option 1: bench -> B E N C H -> but E is absent? We must avoid E. So ""bench"" has E -> invalid.

   Option 2: lunch -> L U N C H -> Does it contain forbidden letters? L, U, N, C, H. None of R, A, E. So it could be a candidate.

   Option 3: pinch -> P I N C H -> letters: P, I, N, C, H -> no R,A,E -> valid.

   Option 4: conch -> C O N C H -> but note: the word has two C's? We don't know if the secret word has two C's. But our feedback only showed one C? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one C (at start) and marked as present but wrong position. There could be another C? However, the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. We have to be cautious.

 But let's analyze: in ""crane"", we had one C and we were told it was present but in the wrong position. So the secret word contains at least one C. It could contain more? We don't know.

 Similarly, N is present at least once.

 Now, in the word ""conch"", it has two C's. We can use that to test? But also note we haven't tried O and H.

 However, we have to consider that our guess must be a valid 5-letter word.

 But note: the feedback only marks the letters that are present. For duplicates, if there are two C's and we only guess one, then we might not get full information? But in this case we have two if we use ""conch"".

 Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't have duplicates to avoid confusion? But we don't know if the secret has duplicates.

 Since we are learning, maybe we avoid duplicates for now.

 Let me pick ""pinch"": P-I-N-C-H.

 Positions:
   P at 1
   I at 2
   N at 3
   C at 4
   H at 5

 Why is this good?
   We are putting N in position 3 (which is allowed, since it wasn't in position 4) and C in position 4 (which is allowed, since it wasn't in position 1). We are avoiding E, A, R.

   Also, we test new letters: P, I, H.

   We hope this gives us more information.

 Alternative: ""lynch"" -> L Y N C H -> also works? But Y is a vowel. However, ""lynch"" is a word.

 But I think ""pinch"" is more common.

 Another idea: we could use a word that might cover more common letters? We haven't tested: O, U, I, L, T, S, etc.

 But we know we must include C and N and avoid R, A, E.

 ""Pinch"" includes I and P and H.

 Alternatively, what about ""sight""? But note: must have C and N ... and ""sight"" does not have C or N. So we must pick a word that contains C and N because we know they are in the word.

 Therefore, I will go with ""pinch"".

 Let me write the guess: pinch

 So, the next guess is ""pinch"".

- **A(x)** → A is absent  
- **N(-)** → N is in the word but not in position 4  
- **E(x)** → E is absent

1. The secret word contains **C** and **N**, but **no R, A, E**.  
2. C cannot be in position 1 (must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5).  
3. N cannot be in position 4 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5).

 - R is not in the word at all (x).

   Similarly, N is not in position 4.

 Possible positions for C: It cannot be in position 1. So it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 Since we have two letters we know (C and N) and we want to test other common letters, we can form a word that has C and N in positions different from the first guess and include other common consonants and vowels.

 Important: In the feedback, the letters that are absent (R, A, E) we must avoid.

 Example positions: Let's put C in position 2 and N in position 5? Or maybe position 3?

   We are putting N in position 3 (which is allowed, since it wasn't in position 4) and C in position 4 (which is allowed, since it wasn't in position 1). We are avoiding E, A, R.

   Also, we test new letters: P, I, H.

   We hope this gives us more information.

 Alternative: ""lynch"" -> L Y N C H -> also works? But Y is a vowel. However, ""lynch"" is a word.

 But I think ""pinch"" is more common.

 Another idea: we could use a word that might cover more common letters? We haven't tested: O, U, I, L, T, S, etc.

 But we know we must include C and N and avoid R, A, E.

 ""Pinch"" includes I and P and H.

 Alternatively, what about ""sight""? But note: must have C and N ... and ""sight"" does not have C or N. So we must pick a word that contains C and N because we know they are in the word.

 Therefore, I will go with ""pinch"".

 Let me write the guess: pinch

 So, the next guess is ""pinch"".

<guess>pinch</guess>Given the feedback for ""crane"":  
- **C(-)** → C is in the word but not in position 1  
- **R(x)** → R is absent  
- **A(x)** → A is absent  
- **N(-)** → N is in the word but not in position 4  
- **E(x)** → E is absent  

Key deductions:  
1. The secret word contains **C** and **N**, but **no R, A, E**.  
2. C cannot be in position 1 (must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5).  
3. N cannot be in position 4 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5).  
4. New guess must include **C** and **N** while avoiding R, A, E, and testing new common letters.  

I chose **PINCH**:  
- **P, I, N, C, H** → No R, A, E  
- Positions:  
  - C placed in position 4 (≠1, allowed)  
  - N placed in position 3 (≠4, allowed)  
- Tests new vowels (**I**) and consonants (**P, H**).  

This guess efficiently probes valid positions for C/N and introduces untested common letters for maximum information.

We are given feedback from the second guess ""pinch"":
  P(x) -> P is not in the word.
  I(-) -> I is in the word but not in position 2.
  N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in ""pinch"" N is the third letter).
  C(-) -> C is in the word but not in position 4 (because we placed C in position 4 and it's marked as wrong position).
  H(x) -> H is not in the word.

So, updating our knowledge:

From guess 1 (""crane""):
  - The word contains C and N (and not R, A, E).
  - C is not in position 1.
  - N is not in position 4.

From guess 2 (""pinch""):
  - The word contains I (since I is present but in the wrong position) and N (correctly in position 3) and C (present but not in position 4).
  - P and H are absent.
  - I is not in position 2.
  - N is confirmed in position 3 (so we know the third letter is N).
  - C is not in position 4.

Therefore, the secret word:
  - Must have the third letter as N (so position 3 is N).
  - Contains C and I (and we already knew about N, which is fixed at position 3).
  - Does not contain: R, A, E, P, H.

Also, from the first guess, we know C is not in position 1, and now we also know C is not in position 4. So C must be in position 2 or 5 (since position 3 is taken by N).

Similarly, I is in the word but not in position 2. So I can be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and we have three known present letters: C, I, N (with N fixed at position 3). So we need to find two more letters.

We have to avoid: R, A, E, P, H.

We can list the letters we haven't tested yet (that are not in the absent list). The absent letters so far: R, A, E, P, H.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that:
  - Has N in position 3.
  - Contains C (in position 2 or 5) and I (in position 1, 4, or 5, but not 2 and not 3 which is taken).
  - Does not contain R, A, E, P, H.

We can try to think of words that fit.

Let me consider the possible positions for C and I.

Case 1: C in position 2 and I in position 1, 4, or 5.
Case 2: C in position 5 and I in position 1, 4, or 5.

But note: if C is in position 5, then I cannot be in position 5? Because one letter per position. Similarly, if I is in position 5, then C cannot be in position 5.

So let's break down:

Option A: C in position 2, then I can be in 1, 4, or 5.
Option B: C in position 5, then I can be in 1 or 4.

We also need to fill the remaining positions with letters that are not in the absent list.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let me try to think of words with N in the middle (position 3).

For example, if we put I in position 1 and C in position 2: then we have I, C, N, and then two more letters. But we don't know the last two. Words like: I C N _ _ 

But we need to avoid R,A,E,P,H. So possible words: ICKLE? But ICKLE has E -> invalid. Or ""ICONS"" but has O and S? But we don't know if they are in the word. However, ""ICONS"" has S and we haven't tested S. But note: we have position 1: I, position 2: C, position 3: N, position 4: O, position 5: S. But we know I is not in position 2? Wait, in this case I is in position 1, which is allowed. But we have C in position 2? That's one of the options. However, we must check if the word is valid. ""ICONS"" is a word? Actually, ""ICON"" is a word, but ""ICONS"" is the plural. But let's assume it's allowed.

But wait: we have feedback that I is present but not in position 2. If we put I in position 1, that's allowed. But we don't know if I is in position 1 until we try.

Alternatively, we could try to put I in position 4 or 5 to test.

But we also have to consider that we have limited guesses. We should try to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know N is fixed at position 3, we can try to use a word that has C in a new position (either 2 or 5) and I in a new position (1,4,5) and also test other common letters.

Let me list some words that fit:

- With C in position 2 and I in position 1: 
  - ICONS -> I C O N S -> but we don't know about O and S. Also, we avoid R,A,E,P,H -> valid? O and S are not forbidden. So it's a candidate.

- With C in position 2 and I in position 4:
  - We have _ C N I _ 
  - Example: ""OCNIA""? Not a word. ""SCION"" -> S C I O N -> but note: in ""SCION"", the positions: S at 1, C at 2, I at 3? But position 3 is N, not I. So that doesn't work. We need position 3 to be N. So the pattern: _ C N I _ 
  - Words: ""ACINI"" but A is forbidden. ""CYNIc"" but has E? and also not 5 letters? ""cynic"" is 5 letters but has C at 1? We need C at 2. Actually, ""cynic"" is C Y N I C -> but then position 1 is C, which we know is not allowed (C cannot be in position 1). And also we have two C's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we know C is present, but we don't know if twice. But in this case, we are putting C in position 1 and 5? But position 1 is forbidden for C. So invalid.

  Let me think of words with pattern: ? C N I ? 
  Example: ""OCNID"" not a word. ""SCNIF"" not a word. It's hard to find.

- With C in position 2 and I in position 5:
  - Pattern: _ C N _ I
  - Example: ""SCENI"" but E is forbidden. ""ACINI"" has A. ""OCULI"" has O and U, but pattern: O C U L I -> but we need N at position 3? So not. We need the third letter to be N. So: _ C N ? I
  - Words: ""ACINI"" -> A C I N I -> but A is forbidden and also the third letter is I, not N. We need the third letter to be N. So: the word must be: [letter] C N [letter] I.
  - Example: ""ICONI"" not a word. ""SCINT"" -> S C I N T -> but that's S C I N T, so position 3 is I, not N. We need position 3 to be N. So: [letter1] C N [letter4] I.
  - Words: ""ACNED"" has E and A. ""SCNIA"" not a word. ""UNCI"" is 4 letters. I think there are not many common words.

Now, option B: C in position 5.

Then the word ends with C. And I can be in position 1 or 4.

- If I in position 1: pattern: I _ N _ C
  - Example: ""IONIC"" -> I O N I C -> but has two I's? And O is new. Also, position 4 is I. This word: I O N I C -> positions: 1:I, 2:O, 3:N, 4:I, 5:C -> so it fits: I in position 1 and 4? But we only know that I is present, so it could be multiple. But we are testing. Also, we avoid R,A,E,P,H -> valid. So ""IONIC"" is a candidate.

- If I in position 4: pattern: _ _ N I C
  - Example: ""TONIC"" -> T O N I C -> avoids R,A,E,P,H. Valid. Also, ""CONIC"" but C is at position 1? We know C cannot be at position 1. So ""CONIC"" is invalid. ""SONIC"" -> S O N I C -> valid. ""MONIC"" -> M O N I C -> valid.

So we have several candidates: 
  - ICONS (I in 1, C in 2, N in 3, O in 4, S in 5)
  - IONIC (I in 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5) -> note: two I's and C at the end.
  - TONIC (T in 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5)
  - SONIC (S in 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5)
  - MONIC (M in 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5)

But note: in ""IONIC"", we have I in two positions. We know I is present, but we don't know if it appears twice. Similarly, we are testing O and the first letter (I, T, S, M) and the last letter C.

We also have to consider that we haven't tested many letters. We should try to cover more consonants.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2). We need to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put I in position 1 if we are unsure? But we have to put I somewhere.

Another candidate: what about putting I in position 5? But then C must be in position 2 or 5? If I is in 5, then C cannot be in 5. So C must be in 2. Then pattern: _ C N _ I. But we struggled to find words. Let me try again: words ending with I and having C at position 2 and N at 3.

Example: ""SCANTI"" -> 6 letters? No. ""SCANT"" is 5 but without I. ""INCUR"" has R. ""INCUS"" -> I N C U S -> but that's I at 1, N at 2, C at 3? But we need N at 3. So not. 

Actually, we can try: ""LYNCI"" -> not a word. It's difficult.

So let's stick with the candidates we have.

We also have the possibility of C in position 2 and I in position 4? But we didn't find a common word. 

Another word: ""MINCE"" -> but E is forbidden. ""WINCE"" -> E forbidden. ""FORCE"" -> no N and E? Not.

So I think the candidates are: ICONS, IONIC, TONIC, SONIC, MONIC.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test new letters.

In ICONS: tests I, C, O, N, S -> we already know I, C, N are present, so we are testing O and S.

In IONIC: tests I, O, N, I, C -> we know I, C, N, so we are testing O and also the fact that I might be duplicated? But we don't get new letters except O.

In TONIC: tests T, O, N, I, C -> we know N, I, C, so we are testing T and O.

Similarly, SONIC: tests S, O, N, I, C -> tests S and O.

MONIC: tests M, O, N, I, C -> tests M and O.

We haven't tested O, S, T, M, etc.

To maximize new letters, we might choose a word that has two new letters that are common.

Common letters: S, T, O, L, etc. But L is not in any of these? We don't have L in these words.

Among these, ICONS tests two new letters: O and S (and we know I, C, N). Similarly, TONIC tests T and O.

S and T are very common. O is a vowel.

But note: in ICONS, we are putting I in position 1 and C in position 2. We don't know if I is in position 1 or not. Similarly, in TONIC, we are putting I in position 4 and C in position 5.

We also know that I is not in position 2, but we don't know about position 1 or 4.

We could choose a word that tests a different position for I.

But let's consider: if we choose ICONS, and if the word is not ICONS, we might get feedback that tells us about I in position 1 and C in position 2.

Similarly, if we choose TONIC, we test I in position 4 and C in position 5.

We also know that C must be in position 2 or 5. So by choosing a word that has C in one of these positions, we can confirm or deny that position.

Similarly for I.

But we have two possibilities for C: 2 or 5. We can try to test one of them.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to one of these but tests both? But that's hard because we have to have N in the middle.

Another idea: what about a word that has C in position 5 and I in position 1? That would be IONIC. Then we test both: I in 1 and C in 5.

But we also test O in position 2.

So IONIC tests:
  - I in position 1: if it's correct, we get a check, if not, we know I is not in 1 and then must be in 4 (since we know it's not in 2 or 3).
  - C in position 5: if correct, we get a check, if not, then C must be in position 2 (since we know it's not in 1,3,4).

So it can help us narrow down the positions.

Similarly, if we choose ICONS, we test I in 1 and C in 2.

But if we choose IONIC, we test two positions at once: I in 1 and C in 5.

Also, we test the letter O.

So I think IONIC is a good choice because it tests two critical positions.

But note: IONIC has two I's. The feedback might be confusing? Let me think: the secret word might have one I or two I's.

In the feedback for ""pinch"", we had I marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't tell us the count. So the secret word could have one I or more.

In IONIC, we have I at position 1 and 4. If the secret word has only one I, then one of these will be marked as present (if in the word) and the other as absent? But the feedback marks each occurrence.

The rules: for each letter in the guess, we get feedback. So if the secret word has one I, then in IONIC:
  - If the I is in position 1 and that is the only I, then position 1 I would be marked as correct (if it's the right position) or present (if wrong position) and the I in position 4 would be absent? But wait, if the secret word has only one I, then the first I (if it matches the position) would be marked ✓, and the second I would be marked x because there's no second I. Or if the first I is not in the word (but we know I is in the word, so it must be that the second I is the one that is present?).

But we know that I is in the word, so at least one I must be present. But if the secret word has only one I, then one of the I's in IONIC will be marked as present (either in the correct position or wrong) and the other as absent.

But we don't know the position of I yet. So it might be messy.

To avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

Therefore, let's avoid IONIC.

Then, consider TONIC: T O N I C -> no duplicates. Tests T, O, and also I in position 4 and C in position 5.

Similarly, SONIC: S O N I C -> no duplicates.

MONIC: M O N I C -> no duplicates.

ICONS: I C O N S -> no duplicates.

So all of these are without duplicates except IONIC.

So we can choose among TONIC, SONIC, MONIC, ICONS.

Now, which one? We want to test common letters.

The most common consonants: S, T, L, etc. We haven't tested S or T.

ICONS has S and O, and also tests I in 1 and C in 2.

TONIC has T and O, and tests I in 4 and C in 5.

We don't know which position for C and I is correct.

But if we choose ICONS, we are testing the hypothesis that C is in position 2 and I in position 1.

If we choose TONIC, we are testing C in position 5 and I in position 4.

We have two cases for C: either in 2 or in 5. We can choose one to test.

But we have to make a choice.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use C and I in the same positions as the hypotheses? But we have to include them.

Another idea: what if we choose a word that has C in position 5 and I in position 1? But that would be IONIC, which we set aside because of duplicate I. But if we avoid duplicates, then we cannot have I in two positions. So we cannot have a word with I in 1 and C in 5 without having I in 1 and then I in 4? Actually, we can have a word with I in 1 and C in 5 and no other I. For example, ""IONIC"" has two I's, but is there a word like I _ N _ C without a second I? 

For example: ""IRONC"" not a word. ""IGNAC"" not a word. ""IXNAC"" not. So I think it's hard. 

Therefore, we stick with the four candidates without duplicates.

I think we should choose a word that tests C in one of the positions and I in one of the positions, and also tests two new common letters.

Let me choose TONIC: because T is a very common letter, and O is a vowel.

So TONIC: T at 1, O at 2, N at 3, I at 4, C at 5.

If we get feedback:
  - If T is in the word? We don't know.
  - O: new letter.
  - N is correct (we know).
  - I at 4: we will see if it's correct or not.
  - C at 5: we will see.

This will tell us:
  - If C is in position 5: if we get C(✓) then yes, else if C is present but wrong position, then it must be in position 2 (since we know it's not in 1,3,4). But if we get C(✓) then we know C is at 5.
  - Similarly for I at 4: if we get I(✓) then I is at 4, else if I is present but wrong position, then it must be at 1 (since not at 2,3, and if not at 4, then only 1 or 5, but 5 is taken by C in this guess? But in the secret word, if C is at 5, then I cannot be at 5. So if I is not at 4, then it must be at 1.

So we can deduce.

Similarly, we get information about T and O.

So I think TONIC is a good guess.

We could choose SONIC similarly, but T is more common than S? Actually, both are common.

But let's go with TONIC.

So the next guess: TONIC

But note: we must ensure that T and O are not in the absent list? They are not, because we only have R,A,E,P,H absent.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: CRANE**  
   - Feedback: C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
     - **C** is in the word but not in position 1.  
     - **R, A, E** are absent.  
     - **N** is in the word but not in position 4.  

2. **Guess 2: PINCH**  
   - Feedback: P(x), I(-), N(✓), C(-), H(x)  
     - **P** and **H** are absent.  
     - **I** is in the word but not in position 2.  
     - **N** is correct and in position 3.  
     - **C** is in the word but not in position 4.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**:  
  - **N** is fixed in **position 3** (from N(✓) in ""pinch"").  
  - **C** and **I** are present, but their positions are unknown.  
- **Absent letters**: R, A, E, P, H (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Constraints for C**:  
  - Cannot be in position 1 (from ""crane"") or position 4 (from ""pinch"").  
  - Must be in position 2 or 5.  
- **Constraints for I**:  
  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""pinch"") or position 3 (occupied by N).  
  - Must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
- **Remaining positions**: The secret word has 2 unknown letters (besides C, I, N). These must be from the untested letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test possible positions for C and I while covering new common letters.  
- **Candidates**:  
  - C in position 2 or 5, and I in position 1, 4, or 5 (without overlapping with C).  
  - Avoid absent letters (R, A, E, P, H).  
- **Chosen word: TONIC**  
  - **T O N I C**  
    - Tests **C in position 5** (one of the valid options).  
    - Tests **I in position 4** (a valid option).  
    - **N** is in position 3 (confirmed correct).  
    - Introduces **T** (common consonant) and **O** (common vowel), both untested.  
- **Why TONIC?**  
  - Efficiently narrows down C and I positions:  
    - If C is in position 5, feedback will confirm (✓) or rule it out (if absent, C must be in position 2).  
    - If I is in position 4, feedback will confirm (✓) or suggest position 1/5 (if marked ""-"", I must be in 1 or 5, but 5 is occupied by C in this guess).  
  - Tests two new high-frequency letters (T and O).  
  - Avoids duplicates and absent letters.  

<guess>tonic</guess>",tonic,"We are given feedback from the second guess ""pinch"":
  P(x) -> P is not in the word.
  I(-) -> I is in the word but not in position 2.
  N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in ""pinch"" N is the third letter).
  C(-) -> C is in the word but not in position 4 (because we placed C in position 4 and it's marked as wrong position).
  H(x) -> H is not in the word.

So, updating our knowledge:

From guess 1 (""crane""):
  - The word contains C and N (and not R, A, E).
  - C is not in position 1.
  - N is not in position 4.

From guess 2 (""pinch""):
  - The word contains I (since I is present but in the wrong position) and N (correctly in position 3) and C (present but not in position 4).
  - P and H are absent.
  - I is not in position 2.
  - N is confirmed in position 3 (so we know the third letter is N).
  - C is not in position 4.

Therefore, the secret word:
  - Must have the third letter as N (so position 3 is N).
  - Contains C and I (and we already knew about N, which is fixed at position 3).
  - Does not contain: R, A, E, P, H.

Also, from the first guess, we know C is not in position 1, and now we also know C is not in position 4. So C must be in position 2 or 5 (since position 3 is taken by N).

Similarly, I is in the word but not in position 2. So I can be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and we have three known present letters: C, I, N (with N fixed at position 3). So we need to find two more letters.

We have to avoid: R, A, E, P, H.

We can list the letters we haven't tested yet (that are not in the absent list). The absent letters so far: R, A, E, P, H.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that:
  - Has N in position 3.
  - Contains C (in position 2 or 5) and I (in position 1, 4, or 5, but not 2 and not 3 which is taken).
  - Does not contain R, A, E, P, H.

We can try to think of words that fit.

Let me consider the possible positions for C and I.

Case 1: C in position 2 and I in position 1, 4, or 5.
Case 2: C in position 5 and I in position 1, 4, or 5.

But note: if C is in position 5, then I cannot be in position 5? Because one letter per position. Similarly, if I is in position 5, then C cannot be in position 5.

So let's break down:

Option A: C in position 2, then I can be in 1, 4, or 5.
Option B: C in position 5, then I can be in 1 or 4.

We also need to fill the remaining positions with letters that are not in the absent list.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let me try to think of words with N in the middle (position 3).

For example, if we put I in position 1 and C in position 2: then we have I, C, N, and then two more letters. But we don't know the last two. Words like: I C N _ _ 

But we need to avoid R,A,E,P,H. So possible words: ICKLE? But ICKLE has E -> invalid. Or ""ICONS"" but has O and S? But we don't know if they are in the word. However, ""ICONS"" has S and we haven't tested S. But note: we have position 1: I, position 2: C, position 3: N, position 4: O, position 5: S. But we know I is not in position 2? Wait, in this case I is in position 1, which is allowed. But we have C in position 2? That's one of the options. However, we must check if the word is valid. ""ICONS"" is a word? Actually, ""ICON"" is a word, but ""ICONS"" is the plural. But let's assume it's allowed.

But wait: we have feedback that I is present but not in position 2. If we put I in position 1, that's allowed. But we don't know if I is in position 1 until we try.

Alternatively, we could try to put I in position 4 or 5 to test.

But we also have to consider that we have limited guesses. We should try to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know N is fixed at position 3, we can try to use a word that has C in a new position (either 2 or 5) and I in a new position (1,4,5) and also test other common letters.

Let me list some words that fit:

- With C in position 2 and I in position 1: 
  - ICONS -> I C O N S -> but we don't know about O and S. Also, we avoid R,A,E,P,H -> valid? O and S are not forbidden. So it's a candidate.

- With C in position 2 and I in position 4:
  - We have _ C N I _ 
  - Example: ""OCNIA""? Not a word. ""SCION"" -> S C I O N -> but note: in ""SCION"", the positions: S at 1, C at 2, I at 3? But position 3 is N, not I. So that doesn't work. We need position 3 to be N. So the pattern: _ C N I _ 
  - Words: ""ACINI"" but A is forbidden. ""CYNIc"" but has E? and also not 5 letters? ""cynic"" is 5 letters but has C at 1? We need C at 2. Actually, ""cynic"" is C Y N I C -> but then position 1 is C, which we know is not allowed (C cannot be in position 1). And also we have two C's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we know C is present, but we don't know if twice. But in this case, we are putting C in position 1 and 5? But position 1 is forbidden for C. So invalid.

  Let me think of words with pattern: ? C N I ? 
  Example: ""OCNID"" not a word. ""SCNIF"" not a word. It's hard to find.

- With C in position 2 and I in position 5:
  - Pattern: _ C N _ I
  - Example: ""SCENI"" but E is forbidden. ""ACINI"" has A. ""OCULI"" has O and U, but pattern: O C U L I -> but we need N at position 3? So not. We need the third letter to be N. So: _ C N ? I
  - Words: ""ACINI"" -> A C I N I -> but A is forbidden and also the third letter is I, not N. We need the third letter to be N. So: the word must be: [letter] C N [letter] I.
  - Example: ""ICONI"" not a word. ""SCINT"" -> S C I N T -> but that's S C I N T, so position 3 is I, not N. We need position 3 to be N. So: [letter1] C N [letter4] I.
  - Words: ""ACNED"" has E and A. ""SCNIA"" not a word. ""UNCI"" is 4 letters. I think there are not many common words.

Now, option B: C in position 5.

Then the word ends with C. And I can be in position 1 or 4.

- If I in position 1: pattern: I _ N _ C
  - Example: ""IONIC"" -> I O N I C -> but has two I's? And O is new. Also, position 4 is I. This word: I O N I C -> positions: 1:I, 2:O, 3:N, 4:I, 5:C -> so it fits: I in position 1 and 4? But we only know that I is present, so it could be multiple. But we are testing. Also, we avoid R,A,E,P,H -> valid. So ""IONIC"" is a candidate.

- If I in position 4: pattern: _ _ N I C
  - Example: ""TONIC"" -> T O N I C -> avoids R,A,E,P,H. Valid. Also, ""CONIC"" but C is at position 1? We know C cannot be at position 1. So ""CONIC"" is invalid. ""SONIC"" -> S O N I C -> valid. ""MONIC"" -> M O N I C -> valid.

So we have several candidates: 
  - ICONS (I in 1, C in 2, N in 3, O in 4, S in 5)
  - IONIC (I in 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5) -> note: two I's and C at the end.
  - TONIC (T in 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5)
  - SONIC (S in 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5)
  - MONIC (M in 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5)

But note: in ""IONIC"", we have I in two positions. We know I is present, but we don't know if it appears twice. Similarly, we are testing O and the first letter (I, T, S, M) and the last letter C.

We also have to consider that we haven't tested many letters. We should try to cover more consonants.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2). We need to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put I in position 1 if we are unsure? But we have to put I somewhere.

Another candidate: what about putting I in position 5? But then C must be in position 2 or 5? If I is in 5, then C cannot be in 5. So C must be in 2. Then pattern: _ C N _ I. But we struggled to find words. Let me try again: words ending with I and having C at position 2 and N at 3.

Example: ""SCANTI"" -> 6 letters? No. ""SCANT"" is 5 but without I. ""INCUR"" has R. ""INCUS"" -> I N C U S -> but that's I at 1, N at 2, C at 3? But we need N at 3. So not. 

Actually, we can try: ""LYNCI"" -> not a word. It's difficult.

So let's stick with the candidates we have.

We also have the possibility of C in position 2 and I in position 4? But we didn't find a common word. 

Another word: ""MINCE"" -> but E is forbidden. ""WINCE"" -> E forbidden. ""FORCE"" -> no N and E? Not.

So I think the candidates are: ICONS, IONIC, TONIC, SONIC, MONIC.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test new letters.

In ICONS: tests I, C, O, N, S -> we already know I, C, N are present, so we are testing O and S.

In IONIC: tests I, O, N, I, C -> we know I, C, N, so we are testing O and also the fact that I might be duplicated? But we don't get new letters except O.

In TONIC: tests T, O, N, I, C -> we know N, I, C, so we are testing T and O.

Similarly, SONIC: tests S, O, N, I, C -> tests S and O.

MONIC: tests M, O, N, I, C -> tests M and O.

We haven't tested O, S, T, M, etc.

To maximize new letters, we might choose a word that has two new letters that are common.

Common letters: S, T, O, L, etc. But L is not in any of these? We don't have L in these words.

Among these, ICONS tests two new letters: O and S (and we know I, C, N). Similarly, TONIC tests T and O.

S and T are very common. O is a vowel.

But note: in ICONS, we are putting I in position 1 and C in position 2. We don't know if I is in position 1 or not. Similarly, in TONIC, we are putting I in position 4 and C in position 5.

We also know that I is not in position 2, but we don't know about position 1 or 4.

We could choose a word that tests a different position for I.

But let's consider: if we choose ICONS, and if the word is not ICONS, we might get feedback that tells us about I in position 1 and C in position 2.

Similarly, if we choose TONIC, we test I in position 4 and C in position 5.

We also know that C must be in position 2 or 5. So by choosing a word that has C in one of these positions, we can confirm or deny that position.

Similarly for I.

But we have two possibilities for C: 2 or 5. We can try to test one of them.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to one of these but tests both? But that's hard because we have to have N in the middle.

Another idea: what about a word that has C in position 5 and I in position 1? That would be IONIC. Then we test both: I in 1 and C in 5.

But we also test O in position 2.

So IONIC tests:
  - I in position 1: if it's correct, we get a check, if not, we know I is not in 1 and then must be in 4 (since we know it's not in 2 or 3).
  - C in position 5: if correct, we get a check, if not, then C must be in position 2 (since we know it's not in 1,3,4).

So it can help us narrow down the positions.

Similarly, if we choose ICONS, we test I in 1 and C in 2.

But if we choose IONIC, we test two positions at once: I in 1 and C in 5.

Also, we test the letter O.

So I think IONIC is a good choice because it tests two critical positions.

But note: IONIC has two I's. The feedback might be confusing? Let me think: the secret word might have one I or two I's.

In the feedback for ""pinch"", we had I marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't tell us the count. So the secret word could have one I or more.

In IONIC, we have I at position 1 and 4. If the secret word has only one I, then one of these will be marked as present (if in the word) and the other as absent? But the feedback marks each occurrence.

The rules: for each letter in the guess, we get feedback. So if the secret word has one I, then in IONIC:
  - If the I is in position 1 and that is the only I, then position 1 I would be marked as correct (if it's the right position) or present (if wrong position) and the I in position 4 would be absent? But wait, if the secret word has only one I, then the first I (if it matches the position) would be marked ✓, and the second I would be marked x because there's no second I. Or if the first I is not in the word (but we know I is in the word, so it must be that the second I is the one that is present?).

But we know that I is in the word, so at least one I must be present. But if the secret word has only one I, then one of the I's in IONIC will be marked as present (either in the correct position or wrong) and the other as absent.

But we don't know the position of I yet. So it might be messy.

To avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

Therefore, let's avoid IONIC.

Then, consider TONIC: T O N I C -> no duplicates. Tests T, O, and also I in position 4 and C in position 5.

Similarly, SONIC: S O N I C -> no duplicates.

MONIC: M O N I C -> no duplicates.

ICONS: I C O N S -> no duplicates.

So all of these are without duplicates except IONIC.

So we can choose among TONIC, SONIC, MONIC, ICONS.

Now, which one? We want to test common letters.

The most common consonants: S, T, L, etc. We haven't tested S or T.

ICONS has S and O, and also tests I in 1 and C in 2.

TONIC has T and O, and tests I in 4 and C in 5.

We don't know which position for C and I is correct.

But if we choose ICONS, we are testing the hypothesis that C is in position 2 and I in position 1.

If we choose TONIC, we are testing C in position 5 and I in position 4.

We have two cases for C: either in 2 or in 5. We can choose one to test.

But we have to make a choice.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use C and I in the same positions as the hypotheses? But we have to include them.

Another idea: what if we choose a word that has C in position 5 and I in position 1? But that would be IONIC, which we set aside because of duplicate I. But if we avoid duplicates, then we cannot have I in two positions. So we cannot have a word with I in 1 and C in 5 without having I in 1 and then I in 4? Actually, we can have a word with I in 1 and C in 5 and no other I. For example, ""IONIC"" has two I's, but is there a word like I _ N _ C without a second I? 

For example: ""IRONC"" not a word. ""IGNAC"" not a word. ""IXNAC"" not. So I think it's hard. 

Therefore, we stick with the four candidates without duplicates.

I think we should choose a word that tests C in one of the positions and I in one of the positions, and also tests two new common letters.

Let me choose TONIC: because T is a very common letter, and O is a vowel.

So TONIC: T at 1, O at 2, N at 3, I at 4, C at 5.

If we get feedback:
  - If T is in the word? We don't know.
  - O: new letter.
  - N is correct (we know).
  - I at 4: we will see if it's correct or not.
  - C at 5: we will see.

This will tell us:
  - If C is in position 5: if we get C(✓) then yes, else if C is present but wrong position, then it must be in position 2 (since we know it's not in 1,3,4). But if we get C(✓) then we know C is at 5.
  - Similarly for I at 4: if we get I(✓) then I is at 4, else if I is present but wrong position, then it must be at 1 (since not at 2,3, and if not at 4, then only 1 or 5, but 5 is taken by C in this guess? But in the secret word, if C is at 5, then I cannot be at 5. So if I is not at 4, then it must be at 1.

So we can deduce.

Similarly, we get information about T and O.

So I think TONIC is a good guess.

We could choose SONIC similarly, but T is more common than S? Actually, both are common.

But let's go with TONIC.

So the next guess: TONIC

But note: we must ensure that T and O are not in the absent list? They are not, because we only have R,A,E,P,H absent.

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 This means:
 - C is present in the secret word but not in the first position (since it's marked with - meaning wrong position).
 - R is not in the word at all (x).
 - A is not in the word (x).
 - N is present but not in the fourth position (wrong position).
 - E is not in the word (x).

 So, we know:
   The secret word contains C and N, but not R, A, E.
   C is not in position 1 (since we had C in position 1 and it's marked wrong position, so it must be in another position).
   Similarly, N is not in position 4.

 The secret word is 5 letters long and must include C and N, and exclude R, A, E.

 Since R, A, E are not present, we can eliminate words containing these letters.

 Now, let's think about possible positions for C and N.
 Possible positions for C: It cannot be in position 1. So it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, N cannot be in position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and includes C and N (at least) but we don't know if there are other letters.

 Since we have two marked as present (C and N) and three absent (R, A, E), the word has at least these two letters.

 We need to make a second guess that:
   - Does not contain R, A, E.
   - Contains C and N (since they are present, we might want to try them in different positions).
   - Also, we try to include other common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 But note: we don't know what other letters are in the word, so we should try to test new common letters.

 Let me list the vowels we haven't tried: O, U, I (since A and E are out, and we know E is out). We also have consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we have two letters we know (C and N) and we want to test other common letters, we can form a word that has C and N in positions different from the first guess and include other common consonants and vowels.

 Important: In the feedback, the letters that are absent (R, A, E) we must avoid.

 Let me try to think of words that have C and N, and no R, A, E.

 Also, note that C was originally in position 1 and now we know it's not position 1, so we can try C in a different position.

 Similarly, N was in position 4 and that is wrong, so we should put N in a different position.

 Example positions: Let's put C in position 2 and N in position 5? Or maybe position 3?

 We can choose a word that has:
   - C in position 2 (since position 1 is forbidden for C) and N in position 3? But note: we must avoid positions that we know are wrong for each specific letter.

 However, note the feedback only tells us that C is not in position 1 and N is not in position 4. They could be anywhere else.

 Let me try to form words:

 Common words with C and N: ""lunch"", ""bench"", ""pinch"", ""conch"", etc.

 But we have to avoid R, A, E. Also, we must consider the missing letters.

 Since E is absent, words ending with E are out? But also avoid A and R.

 Let's consider:

   Option 1: bench -> B E N C H -> but E is absent? We must avoid E. So ""bench"" has E -> invalid.

   Option 2: lunch -> L U N C H -> Does it contain forbidden letters? L, U, N, C, H. None of R, A, E. So it could be a candidate.

   Option 3: pinch -> P I N C H -> letters: P, I, N, C, H -> no R,A,E -> valid.

   Option 4: conch -> C O N C H -> but note: the word has two C's? We don't know if the secret word has two C's. But our feedback only showed one C? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one C (at start) and marked as present but wrong position. There could be another C? However, the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. We have to be cautious.

 But let's analyze: in ""crane"", we had one C and we were told it was present but in the wrong position. So the secret word contains at least one C. It could contain more? We don't know.

 Similarly, N is present at least once.

 Now, in the word ""conch"", it has two C's. We can use that to test? But also note we haven't tried O and H.

 However, we have to consider that our guess must be a valid 5-letter word.

 But note: the feedback only marks the letters that are present. For duplicates, if there are two C's and we only guess one, then we might not get full information? But in this case we have two if we use ""conch"".

 Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't have duplicates to avoid confusion? But we don't know if the secret has duplicates.

 Since we are learning, maybe we avoid duplicates for now.

 Let me pick ""pinch"": P-I-N-C-H.

 Positions:
   P at 1
   I at 2
   N at 3
   C at 4
   H at 5

 Why is this good?
   We are putting N in position 3 (which is allowed, since it wasn't in position 4) and C in position 4 (which is allowed, since it wasn't in position 1). We are avoiding E, A, R.

   Also, we test new letters: P, I, H.

   We hope this gives us more information.

 Alternative: ""lynch"" -> L Y N C H -> also works? But Y is a vowel. However, ""lynch"" is a word.

 But I think ""pinch"" is more common.

 Another idea: we could use a word that might cover more common letters? We haven't tested: O, U, I, L, T, S, etc.

 But we know we must include C and N and avoid R, A, E.

 ""Pinch"" includes I and P and H.

 Alternatively, what about ""sight""? But note: must have C and N ... and ""sight"" does not have C or N. So we must pick a word that contains C and N because we know they are in the word.

 Therefore, I will go with ""pinch"".

 Let me write the guess: pinch

 So, the next guess is ""pinch"".

<guess>pinch</guess>Given the feedback for ""crane"":  
- **C(-)** → C is in the word but not in position 1  
- **R(x)** → R is absent  
- **A(x)** → A is absent  
- **N(-)** → N is in the word but not in position 4  
- **E(x)** → E is absent  

Key deductions:  
1. The secret word contains **C** and **N**, but **no R, A, E**.  
2. C cannot be in position 1 (must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5).  
3. N cannot be in position 4 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5).  
4. New guess must include **C** and **N** while avoiding R, A, E, and testing new common letters.  

I chose **PINCH**:  
- **P, I, N, C, H** → No R, A, E  
- Positions:  
  - C placed in position 4 (≠1, allowed)  
  - N placed in position 3 (≠4, allowed)  
- Tests new vowels (**I**) and consonants (**P, H**).  

This guess efficiently probes valid positions for C/N and introduces untested common letters for maximum information.

<guess>pinch</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: pinch -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(-) N(✓) C(-) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the second guess ""pinch"":
  P(x) -> P is not in the word.
  I(-) -> I is in the word but not in position 2.
  N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in ""pinch"" N is the third letter).
  C(-) -> C is in the word but not in position 4 (because we placed C in position 4 and it's marked as wrong position).
  H(x) -> H is not in the word.

So, updating our knowledge:

From guess 1 (""crane""):
  - The word contains C and N (and not R, A, E).
  - C is not in position 1.
  - N is not in position 4.

From guess 2 (""pinch""):
  - The word contains I (since I is present but in the wrong position) and N (correctly in position 3) and C (present but not in position 4).
  - P and H are absent.
  - I is not in position 2.
  - N is confirmed in position 3 (so we know the third letter is N).
  - C is not in position 4.

Therefore, the secret word:
  - Must have the third letter as N (so position 3 is N).
  - Contains C and I (and we already knew about N, which is fixed at position 3).
  - Does not contain: R, A, E, P, H.

Also, from the first guess, we know C is not in position 1, and now we also know C is not in position 4. So C must be in position 2 or 5 (since position 3 is taken by N).

Similarly, I is in the word but not in position 2. So I can be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and we have three known present letters: C, I, N (with N fixed at position 3). So we need to find two more letters.

We have to avoid: R, A, E, P, H.

We can list the letters we haven't tested yet (that are not in the absent list). The absent letters so far: R, A, E, P, H.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that:
  - Has N in position 3.
  - Contains C (in position 2 or 5) and I (in position 1, 4, or 5, but not 2 and not 3 which is taken).
  - Does not contain R, A, E, P, H.

We can try to think of words that fit.

Let me consider the possible positions for C and I.

Case 1: C in position 2 and I in position 1, 4, or 5.
Case 2: C in position 5 and I in position 1, 4, or 5.

But note: if C is in position 5, then I cannot be in position 5? Because one letter per position. Similarly, if I is in position 5, then C cannot be in position 5.

So let's break down:

Option A: C in position 2, then I can be in 1, 4, or 5.
Option B: C in position 5, then I can be in 1 or 4.

We also need to fill the remaining positions with letters that are not in the absent list.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let me try to think of words with N in the middle (position 3).

For example, if we put I in position 1 and C in position 2: then we have I, C, N, and then two more letters. But we don't know the last two. Words like: I C N _ _ 

But we need to avoid R,A,E,P,H. So possible words: ICKLE? But ICKLE has E -> invalid. Or ""ICONS"" but has O and S? But we don't know if they are in the word. However, ""ICONS"" has S and we haven't tested S. But note: we have position 1: I, position 2: C, position 3: N, position 4: O, position 5: S. But we know I is not in position 2? Wait, in this case I is in position 1, which is allowed. But we have C in position 2? That's one of the options. However, we must check if the word is valid. ""ICONS"" is a word? Actually, ""ICON"" is a word, but ""ICONS"" is the plural. But let's assume it's allowed.

But wait: we have feedback that I is present but not in position 2. If we put I in position 1, that's allowed. But we don't know if I is in position 1 until we try.

Alternatively, we could try to put I in position 4 or 5 to test.

But we also have to consider that we have limited guesses. We should try to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know N is fixed at position 3, we can try to use a word that has C in a new position (either 2 or 5) and I in a new position (1,4,5) and also test other common letters.

Let me list some words that fit:

- With C in position 2 and I in position 1: 
  - ICONS -> I C O N S -> but we don't know about O and S. Also, we avoid R,A,E,P,H -> valid? O and S are not forbidden. So it's a candidate.

- With C in position 2 and I in position 4:
  - We have _ C N I _ 
  - Example: ""OCNIA""? Not a word. ""SCION"" -> S C I O N -> but note: in ""SCION"", the positions: S at 1, C at 2, I at 3? But position 3 is N, not I. So that doesn't work. We need position 3 to be N. So the pattern: _ C N I _ 
  - Words: ""ACINI"" but A is forbidden. ""CYNIc"" but has E? and also not 5 letters? ""cynic"" is 5 letters but has C at 1? We need C at 2. Actually, ""cynic"" is C Y N I C -> but then position 1 is C, which we know is not allowed (C cannot be in position 1). And also we have two C's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we know C is present, but we don't know if twice. But in this case, we are putting C in position 1 and 5? But position 1 is forbidden for C. So invalid.

  Let me think of words with pattern: ? C N I ? 
  Example: ""OCNID"" not a word. ""SCNIF"" not a word. It's hard to find.

- With C in position 2 and I in position 5:
  - Pattern: _ C N _ I
  - Example: ""SCENI"" but E is forbidden. ""ACINI"" has A. ""OCULI"" has O and U, but pattern: O C U L I -> but we need N at position 3? So not. We need the third letter to be N. So: _ C N ? I
  - Words: ""ACINI"" -> A C I N I -> but A is forbidden and also the third letter is I, not N. We need the third letter to be N. So: the word must be: [letter] C N [letter] I.
  - Example: ""ICONI"" not a word. ""SCINT"" -> S C I N T -> but that's S C I N T, so position 3 is I, not N. We need position 3 to be N. So: [letter1] C N [letter4] I.
  - Words: ""ACNED"" has E and A. ""SCNIA"" not a word. ""UNCI"" is 4 letters. I think there are not many common words.

Now, option B: C in position 5.

Then the word ends with C. And I can be in position 1 or 4.

- If I in position 1: pattern: I _ N _ C
  - Example: ""IONIC"" -> I O N I C -> but has two I's? And O is new. Also, position 4 is I. This word: I O N I C -> positions: 1:I, 2:O, 3:N, 4:I, 5:C -> so it fits: I in position 1 and 4? But we only know that I is present, so it could be multiple. But we are testing. Also, we avoid R,A,E,P,H -> valid. So ""IONIC"" is a candidate.

- If I in position 4: pattern: _ _ N I C
  - Example: ""TONIC"" -> T O N I C -> avoids R,A,E,P,H. Valid. Also, ""CONIC"" but C is at position 1? We know C cannot be at position 1. So ""CONIC"" is invalid. ""SONIC"" -> S O N I C -> valid. ""MONIC"" -> M O N I C -> valid.

So we have several candidates: 
  - ICONS (I in 1, C in 2, N in 3, O in 4, S in 5)
  - IONIC (I in 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5) -> note: two I's and C at the end.
  - TONIC (T in 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5)
  - SONIC (S in 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5)
  - MONIC (M in 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5)

But note: in ""IONIC"", we have I in two positions. We know I is present, but we don't know if it appears twice. Similarly, we are testing O and the first letter (I, T, S, M) and the last letter C.

We also have to consider that we haven't tested many letters. We should try to cover more consonants.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2). We need to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put I in position 1 if we are unsure? But we have to put I somewhere.

Another candidate: what about putting I in position 5? But then C must be in position 2 or 5? If I is in 5, then C cannot be in 5. So C must be in 2. Then pattern: _ C N _ I. But we struggled to find words. Let me try again: words ending with I and having C at position 2 and N at 3.

Example: ""SCANTI"" -> 6 letters? No. ""SCANT"" is 5 but without I. ""INCUR"" has R. ""INCUS"" -> I N C U S -> but that's I at 1, N at 2, C at 3? But we need N at 3. So not. 

Actually, we can try: ""LYNCI"" -> not a word. It's difficult.

So let's stick with the candidates we have.

We also have the possibility of C in position 2 and I in position 4? But we didn't find a common word. 

Another word: ""MINCE"" -> but E is forbidden. ""WINCE"" -> E forbidden. ""FORCE"" -> no N and E? Not.

So I think the candidates are: ICONS, IONIC, TONIC, SONIC, MONIC.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test new letters.

In ICONS: tests I, C, O, N, S -> we already know I, C, N are present, so we are testing O and S.

In IONIC: tests I, O, N, I, C -> we know I, C, N, so we are testing O and also the fact that I might be duplicated? But we don't get new letters except O.

In TONIC: tests T, O, N, I, C -> we know N, I, C, so we are testing T and O.

Similarly, SONIC: tests S, O, N, I, C -> tests S and O.

MONIC: tests M, O, N, I, C -> tests M and O.

We haven't tested O, S, T, M, etc.

To maximize new letters, we might choose a word that has two new letters that are common.

Common letters: S, T, O, L, etc. But L is not in any of these? We don't have L in these words.

Among these, ICONS tests two new letters: O and S (and we know I, C, N). Similarly, TONIC tests T and O.

S and T are very common. O is a vowel.

But note: in ICONS, we are putting I in position 1 and C in position 2. We don't know if I is in position 1 or not. Similarly, in TONIC, we are putting I in position 4 and C in position 5.

We also know that I is not in position 2, but we don't know about position 1 or 4.

We could choose a word that tests a different position for I.

But let's consider: if we choose ICONS, and if the word is not ICONS, we might get feedback that tells us about I in position 1 and C in position 2.

Similarly, if we choose TONIC, we test I in position 4 and C in position 5.

We also know that C must be in position 2 or 5. So by choosing a word that has C in one of these positions, we can confirm or deny that position.

Similarly for I.

But we have two possibilities for C: 2 or 5. We can try to test one of them.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to one of these but tests both? But that's hard because we have to have N in the middle.

Another idea: what about a word that has C in position 5 and I in position 1? That would be IONIC. Then we test both: I in 1 and C in 5.

But we also test O in position 2.

So IONIC tests:
  - I in position 1: if it's correct, we get a check, if not, we know I is not in 1 and then must be in 4 (since we know it's not in 2 or 3).
  - C in position 5: if correct, we get a check, if not, then C must be in position 2 (since we know it's not in 1,3,4).

So it can help us narrow down the positions.

Similarly, if we choose ICONS, we test I in 1 and C in 2.

But if we choose IONIC, we test two positions at once: I in 1 and C in 5.

Also, we test the letter O.

So I think IONIC is a good choice because it tests two critical positions.

But note: IONIC has two I's. The feedback might be confusing? Let me think: the secret word might have one I or two I's.

In the feedback for ""pinch"", we had I marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't tell us the count. So the secret word could have one I or more.

In IONIC, we have I at position 1 and 4. If the secret word has only one I, then one of these will be marked as present (if in the word) and the other as absent? But the feedback marks each occurrence.

The rules: for each letter in the guess, we get feedback. So if the secret word has one I, then in IONIC:
  - If the I is in position 1 and that is the only I, then position 1 I would be marked as correct (if it's the right position) or present (if wrong position) and the I in position 4 would be absent? But wait, if the secret word has only one I, then the first I (if it matches the position) would be marked ✓, and the second I would be marked x because there's no second I. Or if the first I is not in the word (but we know I is in the word, so it must be that the second I is the one that is present?).

But we know that I is in the word, so at least one I must be present. But if the secret word has only one I, then one of the I's in IONIC will be marked as present (either in the correct position or wrong) and the other as absent.

But we don't know the position of I yet. So it might be messy.

To avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

Therefore, let's avoid IONIC.

Then, consider TONIC: T O N I C -> no duplicates. Tests T, O, and also I in position 4 and C in position 5.

Similarly, SONIC: S O N I C -> no duplicates.

MONIC: M O N I C -> no duplicates.

ICONS: I C O N S -> no duplicates.

So all of these are without duplicates except IONIC.

So we can choose among TONIC, SONIC, MONIC, ICONS.

Now, which one? We want to test common letters.

The most common consonants: S, T, L, etc. We haven't tested S or T.

ICONS has S and O, and also tests I in 1 and C in 2.

TONIC has T and O, and tests I in 4 and C in 5.

We don't know which position for C and I is correct.

But if we choose ICONS, we are testing the hypothesis that C is in position 2 and I in position 1.

If we choose TONIC, we are testing C in position 5 and I in position 4.

We have two cases for C: either in 2 or in 5. We can choose one to test.

But we have to make a choice.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use C and I in the same positions as the hypotheses? But we have to include them.

Another idea: what if we choose a word that has C in position 5 and I in position 1? But that would be IONIC, which we set aside because of duplicate I. But if we avoid duplicates, then we cannot have I in two positions. So we cannot have a word with I in 1 and C in 5 without having I in 1 and then I in 4? Actually, we can have a word with I in 1 and C in 5 and no other I. For example, ""IONIC"" has two I's, but is there a word like I _ N _ C without a second I? 

For example: ""IRONC"" not a word. ""IGNAC"" not a word. ""IXNAC"" not. So I think it's hard. 

Therefore, we stick with the four candidates without duplicates.

I think we should choose a word that tests C in one of the positions and I in one of the positions, and also tests two new common letters.

Let me choose TONIC: because T is a very common letter, and O is a vowel.

So TONIC: T at 1, O at 2, N at 3, I at 4, C at 5.

If we get feedback:
  - If T is in the word? We don't know.
  - O: new letter.
  - N is correct (we know).
  - I at 4: we will see if it's correct or not.
  - C at 5: we will see.

This will tell us:
  - If C is in position 5: if we get C(✓) then yes, else if C is present but wrong position, then it must be in position 2 (since we know it's not in 1,3,4). But if we get C(✓) then we know C is at 5.
  - Similarly for I at 4: if we get I(✓) then I is at 4, else if I is present but wrong position, then it must be at 1 (since not at 2,3, and if not at 4, then only 1 or 5, but 5 is taken by C in this guess? But in the secret word, if C is at 5, then I cannot be at 5. So if I is not at 4, then it must be at 1.

So we can deduce.

Similarly, we get information about T and O.

So I think TONIC is a good guess.

We could choose SONIC similarly, but T is more common than S? Actually, both are common.

But let's go with TONIC.

So the next guess: TONIC

But note: we must ensure that T and O are not in the absent list? They are not, because we only have R,A,E,P,H absent.

So <guess>tonic</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: CRANE**  
   - Feedback: C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
     - **C** is in the word but not in position 1.  
     - **R, A, E** are absent.  
     - **N** is in the word but not in position 4.  

2. **Guess 2: PINCH**  
   - Feedback: P(x), I(-), N(✓), C(-), H(x)  
     - **P** and **H** are absent.  
     - **I** is in the word but not in position 2.  
     - **N** is correct and in position 3.  
     - **C** is in the word but not in position 4.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**:  
  - **N** is fixed in **position 3** (from N(✓) in ""pinch"").  
  - **C** and **I** are present, but their positions are unknown.  
- **Absent letters**: R, A, E, P, H (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Constraints for C**:  
  - Cannot be in position 1 (from ""crane"") or position 4 (from ""pinch"").  
  - Must be in position 2 or 5.  
- **Constraints for I**:  
  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""pinch"") or position 3 (occupied by N).  
  - Must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
- **Remaining positions**: The secret word has 2 unknown letters (besides C, I, N). These must be from the untested letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test possible positions for C and I while covering new common letters.  
- **Candidates**:  
  - C in position 2 or 5, and I in position 1, 4, or 5 (without overlapping with C).  
  - Avoid absent letters (R, A, E, P, H).  
- **Chosen word: TONIC**  
  - **T O N I C**  
    - Tests **C in position 5** (one of the valid options).  
    - Tests **I in position 4** (a valid option).  
    - **N** is in position 3 (confirmed correct).  
    - Introduces **T** (common consonant) and **O** (common vowel), both untested.  
- **Why TONIC?**  
  - Efficiently narrows down C and I positions:  
    - If C is in position 5, feedback will confirm (✓) or rule it out (if absent, C must be in position 2).  
    - If I is in position 4, feedback will confirm (✓) or suggest position 1/5 (if marked ""-"", I must be in 1 or 5, but 5 is occupied by C in this guess).  
  - Tests two new high-frequency letters (T and O).  
  - Avoids duplicates and absent letters.

So it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n Similarly, N cannot be in position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and includes C and N (at least) but we don\'t know if there are other letters.\n\n Since we have two marked as present (C and N) and three absent (R, A, E), the word has at least these two letters.\n\n We need to make a second guess that:\n   - Does not contain R, A, E.\n   - Contains C and N (since they are present, we might want to try them in different positions).\n   - Also, we try to include other common letters that we haven\'t tested yet.\n\n But note: we don\'t know what other letters are in the word, so we should try to test new common letters.\n\n Let me list the vowels we haven\'t tried: O, U, I (since A and E are out, and we know E is out). We also have consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n Since we have two letters we know (C and N) and we want to test other common letters, we can form a word that has C and N in positions different from the first guess and include other common consonants and vowels.\n\n Important: In the feedback, the letters that are absent (R, A, E) we must avoid.\n\n Let me try to think of words that have C and N, and no R, A, E.\n\n Also, note that C was originally in position 1 and now we know it\'s not position 1, so we can try C in a different position.\n\n Similarly, N was in position 4 and that is wrong, so we should put N in a different position.\n\n Example positions: Let\'s put C in position 2 and N in position 5? Or maybe position 3?\n\n We can choose a word that has:\n   - C in position 2 (since position 1 is forbidden for C) and N in position 3? But note: we must avoid positions that we know are wrong for each specific letter.\n\n However, note the feedback only tells us that C is not in position 1 and N is not in position 4. They could be anywhere else.\n\n Let me try to form words:\n\n Common words with C and N: ""lunch"", ""bench"", ""pinch"", ""conch"", etc.\n\n But we have to avoid R, A, E. Also, we must consider the missing letters.\n\n Since E is absent, words ending with E are out? But also avoid A and R.\n\n Let\'s consider:\n\n   Option 1: bench -> B E N C H -> but E is absent? We must avoid E. So ""bench"" has E -> invalid.\n\n   Option 2: lunch -> L U N C H -> Does it contain forbidden letters? L, U, N, C, H. None of R, A, E. So it could be a candidate.\n\n   Option 3: pinch -> P I N C H -> letters: P, I, N, C, H -> no R,A,E -> valid.\n\n   Option 4: conch -> C O N C H -> but note: the word has two C\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two C\'s. But our feedback only showed one C? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one C (at start) and marked as present but wrong position. There could be another C? However, the feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are duplicates. We have to be cautious.\n\n But let\'s analyze: in ""crane"", we had one C and we were told it was present but in the wrong position. So the secret word contains at least one C. It could contain more? We don\'t know.\n\n Similarly, N is present at least once.\n\n Now, in the word ""conch"", it has two C\'s. We can use that to test? But also note we haven\'t tried O and H.\n\n However, we have to consider that our guess must be a valid 5-letter word.\n\n But note: the feedback only marks the letters that are present. For duplicates, if there are two C\'s and we only guess one, then we might not get full information? But in this case we have two if we use ""conch"".\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn\'t have duplicates to avoid confusion? But we don\'t know if the secret has duplicates.\n\n Since we are learning, maybe we avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Let me pick ""pinch"": P-I-N-C-H.\n\n Positions:\n   P at 1\n   I at 2\n   N at 3\n   C at 4\n   H at 5\n\n Why is this good?\n   We are putting N in position 3 (which is allowed, since it wasn\'t in position 4) and C in position 4 (which is allowed, since it wasn\'t in position 1). We are avoiding E, A, R.\n\n   Also, we test new letters: P, I, H.\n\n   We hope this gives us more information.\n\n Alternative: ""lynch"" -> L Y N C H -> also works? But Y is a vowel. However, ""lynch"" is a word.\n\n But I think ""pinch"" is more common.\n\n Another idea: we could use a word that might cover more common letters? We haven\'t tested: O, U, I, L, T, S, etc.\n\n But we know we must include C and N and avoid R, A, E.\n\n ""Pinch"" includes I and P and H.\n\n Alternatively, what about ""sight""? But note: must have C and N ... and ""sight"" does not have C or N. So we must pick a word that contains C and N because we know they are in the word.\n\n Therefore, I will go with ""pinch"".\n\n Let me write the guess: pinch\n\n So, the next guess is ""pinch"".\n\n<guess>pinch</guess>Given the feedback for ""crane"":  \n- **C(-)** → C is in the word but not in position 1  \n- **R(x)** → R is absent  \n- **A(x)** → A is absent  \n- **N(-)** → N is in the word but not in position 4  \n- **E(x)** → E is absent  \n\nKey deductions:  \n1. The secret word contains **C** and **N**, but **no R, A, E**.  \n2. C cannot be in position 1 (must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5).  \n3. N cannot be in position 4 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5).  \n4.

So C must be in position 2 or 5 (since position 3 is taken by N).\n\nSimilarly, I is in the word but not in position 2. So I can be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nWe also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and we have three known present letters: C, I, N (with N fixed at position 3). So we need to find two more letters.\n\nWe have to avoid: R, A, E, P, H.\n\nWe can list the letters we haven\'t tested yet (that are not in the absent list). The absent letters so far: R, A, E, P, H.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a word that:\n  - Has N in position 3.\n  - Contains C (in position 2 or 5) and I (in position 1, 4, or 5, but not 2 and not 3 which is taken).\n  - Does not contain R, A, E, P, H.\n\nWe can try to think of words that fit.\n\nLet me consider the possible positions for C and I.\n\nCase 1: C in position 2 and I in position 1, 4, or 5.\nCase 2: C in position 5 and I in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nBut note: if C is in position 5, then I cannot be in position 5? Because one letter per position. Similarly, if I is in position 5, then C cannot be in position 5.\n\nSo let\'s break down:\n\nOption A: C in position 2, then I can be in 1, 4, or 5.\nOption B: C in position 5, then I can be in 1 or 4.\n\nWe also need to fill the remaining positions with letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nWe should try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet me try to think of words with N in the middle (position 3).\n\nFor example, if we put I in position 1 and C in position 2: then we have I, C, N, and then two more letters. But we don\'t know the last two. Words like: I C N _ _ \n\nBut we need to avoid R,A,E,P,H. So possible words: ICKLE? But ICKLE has E -> invalid. Or ""ICONS"" but has O and S? But we don\'t know if they are in the word. However, ""ICONS"" has S and we haven\'t tested S. But note: we have position 1: I, position 2: C, position 3: N, position 4: O, position 5: S. But we know I is not in position 2? Wait, in this case I is in position 1, which is allowed. But we have C in position 2? That\'s one of the options. However, we must check if the word is valid. ""ICONS"" is a word? Actually, ""ICON"" is a word, but ""ICONS"" is the plural. But let\'s assume it\'s allowed.\n\nBut wait: we have feedback that I is present but not in position 2. If we put I in position 1, that\'s allowed. But we don\'t know if I is in position 1 until we try.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to put I in position 4 or 5 to test.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we have limited guesses. We should try to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother idea: since we know N is fixed at position 3, we can try to use a word that has C in a new position (either 2 or 5) and I in a new position (1,4,5) and also test other common letters.\n\nLet me list some words that fit:\n\n- With C in position 2 and I in position 1: \n  - ICONS -> I C O N S -> but we don\'t know about O and S. Also, we avoid R,A,E,P,H -> valid? O and S are not forbidden. So it\'s a candidate.\n\n- With C in position 2 and I in position 4:\n  - We have _ C N I _ \n  - Example: ""OCNIA""? Not a word. ""SCION"" -> S C I O N -> but note: in ""SCION"", the positions: S at 1, C at 2, I at 3? But position 3 is N, not I. So that doesn\'t work. We need position 3 to be N. So the pattern: _ C N I _ \n  - Words: ""ACINI"" but A is forbidden. ""CYNIc"" but has E? and also not 5 letters? ""cynic"" is 5 letters but has C at 1? We need C at 2. Actually, ""cynic"" is C Y N I C -> but then position 1 is C, which we know is not allowed (C cannot be in position 1). And also we have two C\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, we know C is present, but we don\'t know if twice. But in this case, we are putting C in position 1 and 5? But position 1 is forbidden for C. So invalid.\n\n  Let me think of words with pattern: ? C N I ? \n  Example: ""OCNID"" not a word. ""SCNIF"" not a word. It\'s hard to find.\n\n- With C in position 2 and I in position 5:\n  - Pattern: _ C N _ I\n  - Example: ""SCENI"" but E is forbidden. ""ACINI"" has A. ""OCULI"" has O and U, but pattern: O C U L I -> but we need N at position 3? So not. We need the third letter to be N. So: _ C N ? I\n  - Words: ""ACINI"" -> A C I N I -> but A is forbidden and also the third letter is I, not N. We need the third letter to be N. So: the word must be: [letter] C N [letter] I.\n  - Example: ""ICONI"" not a word. ""SCINT"" -> S C I N T -> but that\'s S C I N T, so position 3 is I, not N. We need position 3 to be N. So: [letter1] C N [letter4] I.\n  - Words: ""ACNED"" has E and A. ""SCNIA"" not a word. ""UNCI"" is 4 letters. I think there are not many common words.\n\nNow, option B: C in position 5.\n\nThen the word ends with C. And I can be in position 1 or 4.\n\n- If I in position 1: pattern: I _ N _ C\n  - Example: ""IONIC"" -> I O N I C -> but has two I\'s? And O is new. Also, position 4 is I. This word: I O N I C -> positions: 1:I, 2:O, 3:N, 4:I, 5:C -> so it fits: I in position 1 and 4? But we only know that I is present, so it could be multiple. But we are testing. Also, we avoid R,A,E,P,H -> valid. So ""IONIC"" is a candidate.\n\n- If I in position 4: pattern: _ _ N I C\n  - Example: ""TONIC"" -> T O N I C -> avoids R,A,E,P,H. Valid. Also, ""CONIC"" but C is at position 1? We know C cannot be at position 1. So ""CONIC"" is invalid. ""SONIC"" -> S O N I C -> valid. ""MONIC"" -> M O N I C -> valid.\n\nSo we have several candidates: \n  - ICONS (I in 1, C in 2, N in 3, O in 4, S in 5)\n  - IONIC (I in 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5) -> note: two I\'s and C at the end.\n  - TONIC (T in 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5)\n  - SONIC (S in 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5)\n  - MONIC (M in 1, O in 2, N in 3, I in 4, C in 5)\n\nBut note: in ""IONIC"", we have I in two positions. We know I is present, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. Similarly, we are testing O and the first letter (I, T, S, M) and the last letter C.\n\nWe also have to consider that we haven\'t tested many letters. We should try to cover more consonants.\n\nBut note: we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2). We need to maximize information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put I in position 1 if we are unsure? But we have to put I somewhere.\n\nAnother candidate: what about putting I in position 5? But then C must be in position 2 or 5? If I is in 5, then C cannot be in 5. So C must be in 2. Then pattern: _ C N _ I. But we struggled to find words. Let me try again: words ending with I and having C at position 2 and N at 3.\n\nExample: ""SCANTI"" -> 6 letters? No. ""SCANT"" is 5 but without I. ""INCUR"" has R. ""INCUS"" -> I N C U S -> but that\'s I at 1, N at 2, C at 3? But we need N at 3. So not. \n\nActually, we can try: ""LYNCI"" -> not a word. It\'s difficult.\n\nSo let\'s stick with the candidates we have.\n\nWe also have the possibility of C in position 2 and I in position 4? But we didn\'t find a common word. \n\nAnother word: ""MINCE"" -> but E is forbidden. ""WINCE"" -> E forbidden. ""FORCE"" -> no N and E? Not.\n\nSo I think the candidates are: ICONS, IONIC, TONIC, SONIC, MONIC.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test new letters.\n\nIn ICONS: tests I, C, O, N, S -> we already know I, C, N are present, so we are testing O and S.\n\nIn IONIC: tests I, O, N, I, C -> we know I, C, N, so we are testing O and also the fact that I might be duplicated? But we don\'t get new letters except O.\n\nIn TONIC: tests T, O, N, I, C -> we know N, I, C, so we are testing T and O.\n\nSimilarly, SONIC: tests S, O, N, I, C -> tests S and O.\n\nMONIC: tests M, O, N, I, C -> tests M and O.\n\nWe haven\'t tested O, S, T, M, etc.\n\nTo maximize new letters, we might choose a word that has two new letters that are common.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, O, L, etc. But L is not in any of these? We don\'t have L in these words.\n\nAmong these, ICONS tests two new letters: O and S (and we know I, C, N). Similarly, TONIC tests T and O.\n\nS and T are very common. O is a vowel.\n\nBut note: in ICONS, we are putting I in position 1 and C in position 2. We don\'t know if I is in position 1 or not. Similarly, in TONIC, we are putting I in position 4 and C in position 5.\n\nWe also know that I is not in position 2, but we don\'t know about position 1 or 4.\n\nWe could choose a word that tests a different position for I.\n\nBut let\'s consider: if we choose ICONS, and if the word is not ICONS, we might get feedback that tells us about I in position 1 and C in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose TONIC, we test I in position 4 and C in position 5.\n\nWe also know that C must be in position 2 or 5. So by choosing a word that has C in one of these positions, we can confirm or deny that position.\n\nSimilarly for I.\n\nBut we have two possibilities for C: 2 or 5. We can try to test one of them.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t commit to one of these but tests both? But that\'s hard because we have to have N in the middle.\n\nAnother idea: what about a word that has C in position 5 and I in position 1? That would be IONIC. Then we test both: I in 1 and C in 5.\n\nBut we also test O in position 2.\n\nSo IONIC tests:\n  - I in position 1: if it\'s correct, we get a check, if not, we know I is not in 1 and then must be in 4 (since we know it\'s not in 2 or 3).\n  - C in position 5: if correct, we get a check, if not, then C must be in position 2 (since we know it\'s not in 1,3,4).\n\nSo it can help us narrow down the positions.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose ICONS, we test I in 1 and C in 2.\n\nBut if we choose IONIC, we test two positions at once: I in 1 and C in 5.\n\nAlso, we test the letter O.\n\nSo I think IONIC is a good choice because it tests two critical positions.\n\nBut note: IONIC has two I\'s. The feedback might be confusing? Let me think: the secret word might have one I or two I\'s.\n\nIn the feedback for ""pinch"", we had I marked as present but wrong position. That doesn\'t tell us the count. So the secret word could have one I or more.\n\nIn IONIC, we have I at position 1 and 4. If the secret word has only one I, then one of these will be marked as present (if in the word) and the other as absent? But the feedback marks each occurrence.\n\nThe rules: for each letter in the guess, we get feedback. So if the secret word has one I, then in IONIC:\n  - If the I is in position 1 and that is the only I, then position 1 I would be marked as correct (if it\'s the right position) or present (if wrong position) and the I in position 4 would be absent? But wait, if the secret word has only one I, then the first I (if it matches the position) would be marked ✓, and the second I would be marked x because there\'s no second I. Or if the first I is not in the word (but we know I is in the word, so it must be that the second I is the one that is present?).\n\nBut we know that I is in the word, so at least one I must be present. But if the secret word has only one I, then one of the I\'s in IONIC will be marked as present (either in the correct position or wrong) and the other as absent.\n\nBut we don\'t know the position of I yet. So it might be messy.\n\nTo avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid words with duplicate letters for now.\n\nTherefore, let\'s avoid IONIC.\n\nThen, consider TONIC: T O N I C -> no duplicates. Tests T, O, and also I in position 4 and C in position 5.\n\nSimilarly, SONIC: S O N I C -> no duplicates.\n\nMONIC: M O N I C -> no duplicates.\n\nICONS: I C O N S -> no duplicates.\n\nSo all of these are without duplicates except IONIC.\n\nSo we can choose among TONIC, SONIC, MONIC, ICONS.\n\nNow, which one? We want to test common letters.\n\nThe most common consonants: S, T, L, etc. We haven\'t tested S or T.\n\nICONS has S and O, and also tests I in 1 and C in 2.\n\nTONIC has T and O, and tests I in 4 and C in 5.\n\nWe don\'t know which position for C and I is correct.\n\nBut if we choose ICONS, we are testing the hypothesis that C is in position 2 and I in position 1.\n\nIf we choose TONIC, we are testing C in position 5 and I in position 4.\n\nWe have two cases for C: either in 2 or in 5. We can choose one to test.\n\nBut we have to make a choice.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t use C and I in the same positions as the hypotheses? But we have to include them.\n\nAnother idea: what if we choose a word that has C in position 5 and I in position 1? But that would be IONIC, which we set aside because of duplicate I. But if we avoid duplicates, then we cannot have I in two positions. So we cannot have a word with I in 1 and C in 5 without having I in 1 and then I in 4? Actually, we can have a word with I in 1 and C in 5 and no other I. For example, ""IONIC"" has two I\'s, but is there a word like I _ N _ C without a second I? \n\nFor example: ""IRONC"" not a word. ""IGNAC"" not a word. ""IXNAC"" not. So I think it\'s hard. \n\nTherefore, we stick with the four candidates without duplicates.\n\nI think we should choose a word that tests C in one of the positions and I in one of the positions, and also tests two new common letters.\n\nLet me choose TONIC: because T is a very common letter, and O is a vowel.\n\nSo TONIC: T at 1, O at 2, N at 3, I at 4, C at 5.\n\nIf we get feedback:\n  - If T is in the word? We don\'t know.\n  - O: new letter.\n  - N is correct (we know).\n  - I at 4: we will see if it\'s correct or not.\n  - C at 5: we will see.\n\nThis will tell us:\n  - If C is in position 5: if we get C(✓) then yes, else if C is present but wrong position, then it must be in position 2 (since we know it\'s not in 1,3,4). But if we get C(✓) then we know C is at 5.\n  - Similarly for I at 4: if we get I(✓) then I is at 4, else if I is present but wrong position, then it must be at 1 (since not at 2,3, and if not at 4, then only 1 or 5, but 5 is taken by C in this guess? But in the secret word, if C is at 5, then I cannot be at 5.

We are given feedback for the third guess ""tonic"":
  T(x) -> T is not in the word.
  O(✓) -> O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since in ""tonic"" O is the second letter).
  N(✓) -> N is in the correct position (position 3, which we already knew).
  I(✓) -> I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
  C(✓) -> C is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, we now know:
  - The secret word has O in position 2, N in position 3, I in position 4, and C in position 5.
  - The first letter is unknown, but we know it cannot be T (since T is absent) and also cannot be R, A, E, P, H (from previous feedback).

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ O N I C

We need to find the first letter. It must be a letter that is not in the absent list: absent letters are R, A, E, P, H, T.

Also, we know from the first guess that the word contains C and N (which we have) and does not contain R, A, E. And from the second guess, we know it does not contain P and H. Now we add T to the absent list.

So the first letter must be one of the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid 5-letter word of the form: ? O N I C

Let's list possible words:
  - CONIC? But C is in position 1? We know from the first guess that C cannot be in position 1 (because in ""crane"", C was in position 1 and marked as wrong position). So CONIC is invalid because it has C in position 1.
  - Other words: 
      BONIC (not common, but it might be accepted? However, we need common words)
      DONIC? Not a word.
      FONIC? Not common.
      GONIC? Not a word.
      HONIC? But H is absent (from guess 2: H(x)).
      JONIC? Not a word.
      KONIC? Not a word.
      LONIC? Not a word.
      MONIC -> M O N I C: this is a word (e.g., in mathematics or as a name, but it's accepted in Wordle? We'll assume it is).
      QONIC? Not a word.
      SONIC -> S O N I C: this is a common word.
      TONIC -> we already tried, and T is absent so it can't be.
      UONIC? Not a word.
      VONIC? Not a word.
      WONIC? Not a word.
      XONIC? Not a word.
      YONIC? This is a word (relating to the female genitalia, but it might be accepted).
      ZONIC? Not a word.

So the common words are: MONIC, SONIC, and possibly YONIC.

But note: we already tried TONIC and it wasn't the word (since we got feedback and it didn't show all correct). Also, T is absent.

Now, we have two (or three) candidates: MONIC, SONIC, and YONIC.

But we need to choose one. We can try to use the fact that we have to make a guess and we have only one letter to determine.

We can choose SONIC because it's a very common word, and S is a common letter.

But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we know S was not tested. We haven't tested S yet? Actually, in the second guess we had ""pinch"" which had no S, and third guess ""tonic"" had no S. So we don't know about S.

Similarly, M and Y are also untested.

But we don't need to test for presence because we are only missing the first letter. We can just guess one of these.

However, we have to make a guess. We can choose SONIC because it's more common.

But let's see: the secret word is ?ONIC, and we have three possibilities: MONIC, SONIC, YONIC.

We can try SONIC.

But note: we have 3 guesses left? We used 3, so we have 3 more? Actually, Wordle has 6 guesses total. So we have 3 left.

But we can try to guess one of them.

Alternatively, we could use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we know the last four letters are fixed: O, N, I, C. So the only unknown is the first letter.

Therefore, we must guess one of the candidates.

I think the most common word is SONIC.

So let's guess SONIC.

But note: we must ensure that S is not absent? We don't know, but if we guess SONIC and it's not the word, we get feedback that tells us about S.

If we guess SONIC and the first letter is S, then we get all correct.

If not, and S is absent, then we know S is not in the word, so the word must be MONIC or YONIC.

But if S is present but in the wrong position? But the word has only one unknown position (position 1). And if S is in the word, it must be in position 1? Because the other positions are fixed: O, N, I, C. So if S is in the word, it must be in position 1. Therefore, if we guess SONIC and S is not in position 1, then S must be absent? Because there's no other place for it.

Therefore, if we guess SONIC:
  - If the word is SONIC, we win.
  - If the word is not SONIC, then S must be absent (since it can't be in any other position), so the feedback will show S(x) and then we know the word is either MONIC or YONIC.

Then we can guess MONIC next, and if not, then YONIC.

But we have three guesses, so we can do that.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not one of the candidates but tests multiple letters? For example, a word that has M, S, Y? But we don't have such a word that fits the pattern and doesn't use absent letters.

For example, we could guess a word like ""MOSSY"" but that doesn't have the fixed letters. We cannot change the last four letters because we know they are fixed.

So we must guess one of the candidates.

I think we should start with the most common: SONIC.

3. **Guess 3: TONIC**  
   - Feedback: T(x), O(✓), N(✓), I(✓), C(✓)  
     - **O, N, I, C** all correct in positions 2, 3, 4, 5.  
     - **T** absent.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Secret word structure**: `_ O N I C` (positions 2–5 confirmed).  
- **Absent letters**: R, A, E, P, H, T (cannot be in the word).  
- **First letter (position 1)**:  
  - Must be a letter **not absent** (so not R, A, E, P, H, T).  
  - Must form a valid English word with `ONIC`.  
  - Possible candidates:  
    - **S** → **SONIC** (common word)  
    - **M** → **MONIC** (valid word, e.g., math term)  
    - **Y** → **YONIC** (valid word, but less common)  
    - Others (e.g., B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) do not form valid words.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test the most probable candidate for position 1.  
- **Chosen word: SONIC**  
  - Tests **S** in position 1 (most common option).  
  - If correct, solves the puzzle.  
  - If incorrect, feedback will:  
    - Confirm **S** is absent (narrowing to **MONIC** or **YONIC**).  
    - Use next guess for remaining candidates (e.g., **MONIC**).
