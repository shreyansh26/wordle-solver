We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter of the secret word is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in our next guess.

We have 5 more tries (since one is used).

For the next guess, we want to use a word that:
- Has R in the second position (to keep that confirmed position and test others).
- Uses other common letters that haven't been eliminated (so avoid C, A, N, E).
- Tries to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Common letters in English (excluding C, A, N, E) include: S, T, B, D, H, I, O, U, L, M, P, etc.

We can form a word that fits: _ R _ _ _

Let's think of words that have R in the second position and don't contain C, A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- TRYST (T, R, Y, S, T) -> but has T twice and Y is less common.
- PROUD (P, R, O, U, D) -> good, but we have O and U which are vowels.
- BRISK (B, R, I, S, K) -> this is a good one, but we don't know if B is allowed? We haven't eliminated B.

Wait, we haven't used B, I, S, K, etc. So let's consider:

We know the word must have R in the second position. So the pattern is: [letter] R [letter] [letter] [letter]

We can try to use a word that includes common consonants and vowels that are still available.

Available vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out, and sometimes Y but we can avoid for now).

Let me list some words:
- BRUSH (B, R, U, S, H) -> contains U and S, H.
- DRUID (D, R, U, I, D) -> has D twice, and U, I.
- PRIOR (P, R, I, O, R) -> has R twice and O, but we don't know if R can be repeated? The feedback only showed one R as correct, but it might have more? However, in the first guess, we had only one R and it was correct, but that doesn't rule out another R. But since we are avoiding repetition for information, maybe not.

But note: the feedback for ""CRANE"" showed R as correct and the others as absent. It doesn't tell us if there are duplicate letters. However, since we are trying to maximize information, it's better to use distinct letters if possible.

So, let's try to find a word with R in the second position and four new distinct letters (from the available set).

Available letters: all except C, A, N, E.

I think ""BROIL"" might be a candidate: B, R, O, I, L -> but O and I are vowels.

Another one: ""PRISM"" (P, R, I, S, M) -> this has distinct letters and covers P, I, S, M.

But we don't know if the secret word has a vowel in the first position? It might.

Alternatively, ""TRYST"" has two T's, so not ideal.

""GROUT"" (G, R, O, U, T) -> covers G, O, U, T.

But let's think of a word that uses more common letters.

I recall that in Wordle, after getting one letter, it's good to test other common letters.

We can try ""ROUST"" (R, O, U, S, T) but that would put R in the first position, but we need R in the second.

We must have R in the second position.

So, let's look for words starting with a consonant and then R.

Common starting letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, R (but R is already in second, so first can be any except C, A, N, E).

I think ""PRICK"" (P, R, I, C, K) -> but C is eliminated! We cannot use C.

Similarly, ""BRICK"" has C and is invalid.

""BRINK"" has N, which is eliminated.

So avoid C, A, N, E.

Let me try to form a word: 
- First letter: let's try B -> then we have B R _ _ _
- Then we need three more letters. We can use I, S, T, O, etc.

Word: ""BRISK"" -> B, R, I, S, K -> all letters are allowed (no C, A, N, E). This is a valid word.

Another: ""BRUSH"" -> B, R, U, S, H.

But ""BRISK"" is a common word and covers B, I, S, K.

Alternatively, ""DRIFT"" (D, R, I, F, T) -> but F and T are common.

But we don't know if F is in the word.

I think ""BRISK"" is a good choice because it tests B, I, S, K and keeps R in position.

So, I'll go with ""BRISK"".

But note: we are not sure if B is in the word, but that's the point of guessing.

We are trying to get as much information as possible.

Another option: ""PRISM"" (P, R, I, S, M) -> also good.

Between ""BRISK"" and ""PRISM"", both are good. I'll choose ""BRISK"" because it has K which is less common and might be tested.

But actually, for information, both are similar. Let me see the frequency of letters.

In English, S is very common, so testing S is good. T is also common, but we don't have T in ""BRISK"". We have B, I, S, K.

In ""PRISM"", we have P, I, S, M.

S is in both. I is in both.

B is more common than P? Actually, B is more common than P? Let me recall: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, ...

So P is more common than B? Actually, B is more common than P? No, according to some sources, P is slightly more common than B.

But it doesn't matter much.

We can also consider that we have eliminated A and E, so the vowels left are I, O, U. ""BRISK"" has I, and ""PRISM"" has I. So both test I.

But ""BRISK"" has no O or U, while ""PRISM"" has no O or U either.

I think both are fine. I'll go with ""BRISK"".

So, the next guess is ""BRISK"".

<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the correct position (second letter) (✓).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

Key deductions:
- The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _ (R is fixed in the second position).
- The letters C, A, N, and E are eliminated and cannot appear in the word.
- The next guess must include R in the second position and avoid using C, A, N, E.

Strategy for the second guess:
- Focus on words with R in the second position.
- Use common remaining letters (e.g., S, T, B, I, O, L, M, P) to maximize information gain.
- Test new letters to narrow down possibilities.
- ""BRISK"" is a strong candidate because:
  - It has R in the second position.
  - It uses new, common letters (B, I, S, K) that haven't been tested yet.
  - It avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, E).
  - If any of B, I, S, or K are in the secret word, their feedback will provide valuable clues.

Other considered words (like ""PRISM"" or ""BRUSH"") were rejected because ""BRISK"" offers a balanced mix of consonants and a vowel (I) while covering high-frequency letters.

But note: the feedback for ""CRANE"" showed R as correct and the others as absent. It doesn't tell us if there are duplicate letters. However, since we are trying to maximize information, it's better to use distinct letters if possible.

So, let's try to find a word with R in the second position and four new distinct letters (from the available set).

Available letters: all except C, A, N, E.

I think ""BROIL"" might be a candidate: B, R, O, I, L -> but O and I are vowels.

Another one: ""PRISM"" (P, R, I, S, M) -> this has distinct letters and covers P, I, S, M.

But we don't know if the secret word has a vowel in the first position? It might.

Alternatively, ""TRYST"" has two T's, so not ideal.

""GROUT"" (G, R, O, U, T) -> covers G, O, U, T.

But let's think of a word that uses more common letters.

I recall that in Wordle, after getting one letter, it's good to test other common letters.

We can try ""ROUST"" (R, O, U, S, T) but that would put R in the first position, but we need R in the second.

We must have R in the second position.

So, let's look for words starting with a consonant and then R.

Common starting letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, R (but R is already in second, so first can be any except C, A, N, E).

I think ""PRICK"" (P, R, I, C, K) -> but C is eliminated! We cannot use C.

Similarly, ""BRICK"" has C and is invalid.

""BRINK"" has N, which is eliminated.

So avoid C, A, N, E.

Let me try to form a word: 
- First letter: let's try B -> then we have B R _ _ _
- Then we need three more letters. We can use I, S, T, O, etc.

Word: ""BRISK"" -> B, R, I, S, K -> all letters are allowed (no C, A, N, E). This is a valid word.

Another: ""BRUSH"" -> B, R, U, S, H.

But ""BRISK"" is a common word and covers B, I, S, K.

Alternatively, ""DRIFT"" (D, R, I, F, T) -> but F and T are common.

But we don't know if F is in the word.

I think ""BRISK"" is a good choice because it tests B, I, S, K and keeps R in position.

So, I'll go with ""BRISK"".

But note: we are not sure if B is in the word, but that's the point of guessing.

We are trying to get as much information as possible.

Another option: ""PRISM"" (P, R, I, S, M) -> also good.

Between ""BRISK"" and ""PRISM"", both are good. I'll choose ""BRISK"" because it has K which is less common and might be tested.

But actually, for information, both are similar. Let me see the frequency of letters.

In English, S is very common, so testing S is good. T is also common, but we don't have T in ""BRISK"". We have B, I, S, K.

In ""PRISM"", we have P, I, S, M.

S is in both. I is in both.

B is more common than P? Actually, B is more common than P? Let me recall: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, ...

So P is more common than B? Actually, B is more common than P? No, according to some sources, P is slightly more common than B.

But it doesn't matter much.

We can also consider that we have eliminated A and E, so the vowels left are I, O, U. ""BRISK"" has I, and ""PRISM"" has I. So both test I.

But ""BRISK"" has no O or U, while ""PRISM"" has no O or U either.

I think both are fine. I'll go with ""BRISK"".

So, the next guess is ""BRISK"".<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the correct position (second letter) (✓).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

Key deductions:
- The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _ (R is fixed in the second position).
- The letters C, A, N, and E are eliminated and cannot appear in the word.
- The next guess must include R in the second position and avoid using C, A, N, E.

Strategy for the second guess:
- Focus on words with R in the second position.
- Use common remaining letters (e.g., S, T, B, I, O, L, M, P) to maximize information gain.
- Test new letters to narrow down possibilities.
- ""BRISK"" is a strong candidate because:
  - It has R in the second position.
  - It uses new, common letters (B, I, S, K) that haven't been tested yet.
  - It avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, E).
  - If any of B, I, S, or K are in the secret word, their feedback will provide valuable clues.

Other considered words (like ""PRISM"" or ""BRUSH"") were rejected because ""BRISK"" offers a balanced mix of consonants and a vowel (I) while covering high-frequency letters.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: BRISK
- B: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- K: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The second letter is R.
2. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, B, S, K.
3. The letter I is in the word but not in the third position (since in BRISK it was in the third position and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Second letter: R
- Contains the letter I, but not in the third position. So I must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5.

Also, the word does not contain: C, A, N, E, B, S, K.

We have the pattern: _ R _ _ _

And we know I is in the word but not in the third position.

Available letters: We must avoid C, A, N, E, B, S, K. So we can use other common letters like D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Contains the letter I (but not in the third position).
- Uses only letters that are not eliminated.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down.

The positions for I: it can be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Let's think of words that fit:

Pattern: [I?] R [not I] [I?] [I?]

But we don't know which of the other positions have I. We must include I in one of the first, fourth, or fifth positions.

We can try to put I in the first position? Then the word would be I R _ _ _

But we need to fill the last three letters with letters not eliminated and form a valid word.

Words starting with IR: IRATE (but A and E are eliminated), IRONY (O and N, but N is eliminated), IRKED (K and E eliminated), so not many options.

What about I in the fourth position? Then pattern: _ R _ I _

Or I in the fifth position: _ R _ _ I

We need to choose a word that tests new letters.

Since we have limited information, we should try to cover more ground.

We know I is in the word, so we can try to place it in a different position to see where it belongs.

For example, if we put I in the first position, we can test that. But as above, it might be hard to form a word without eliminated letters.

Alternatively, we can put I in the fourth or fifth and test other vowels or consonants.

We have eliminated A, E, so the remaining vowels are I (which we know is present), O, U, and sometimes Y.

We should test O and U if possible.

Let me try to form a word with I in the fourth position: _ R _ I _

We need to choose the first, third, and fifth letters.

First letter: can be D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, etc.

Third letter: same, but cannot be I.

Fifth letter: same.

For example:
- T R U I P? TRUIP? Not a word.
- D R O I D? DROID? That's a word. But DROID: D, R, O, I, D. But we have D twice? And O is a new letter.

But let's check: DROID is a valid word? Yes, meaning a robot.

But note: we have two D's? The word DROID has D at position 1 and 5.

But we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The feedback so far doesn't indicate duplicates, but it's possible.

But for testing, it's okay.

However, we are testing D, O, and I (which we know is present). But we are not testing many new letters because we are using D twice.

Alternatively, we can try a word with I in the fifth position: _ R _ _ I

For example:
- T R O P I? TROPI? Not a word. But TROPIC is 6 letters. 
- H O R D I? HORDI? Not a word.
- G R O I N? GROIN? But N is eliminated.

We need to avoid N.

Another: F R O T H I? Too long.

Perhaps I in the first position: I R _ _ _

Words: 
- I R I S H? But S is eliminated and we have two I's? Also, S is out.
- I R O N Y? N is eliminated.
- I R A T E? A and E eliminated.
- I R U M P? Not a word.

This is tricky.

What about I in the fourth position? Let me list some words:

- PROUD? But we have O and U, but no I. We must include I because we know it's in the word.

We must include I.

Another idea: put I in the fifth position and use a common word.

For example: 
- T R U M P? But no I. 
- D R I P Y? D, R, I, P, Y -> but I is in the third position? We know I cannot be in the third position because in the second guess (BRISK) I was in the third and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put I in the third again, it would be wrong again? But we want to test other positions.

We need to put I in a new position: either 1, 4, or 5.

Let me try position 4: _ R _ I _

Possible words:
- C R A M I? C and A eliminated.
- F R O T I? Not a word.
- G R I M Y? But I is in the third? We need I in the fourth? GRIMY has I in the fourth? G-R-I-M-Y -> positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:I, 4:M, 5:Y -> so I is in the third, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

We need I in the fourth position: so the fourth letter is I.

So pattern: _ R _ I _

The third letter must not be I, and the first and fifth can be other letters.

Words: 
- T R U I T? TRUIT? Not a word.
- D R O I D? DROID: D (1), R (2), O (3), I (4), D (5). This is a valid word. And it uses D and O.

But we are using D twice. Is that a problem? Not necessarily, but it might not be efficient for information.

Another word: P R O I T? Not a word.

F R I T H? But I is in third? No, if we want I in fourth, then F R ? I ? 

How about ""TRIED""? But E is eliminated.

""ORRIS""? But S is eliminated and no I in fourth? ORRIS: O, R, R, I, S -> but S eliminated and I is in fourth? O(1), R(2), R(3), I(4), S(5) -> but S is out.

Another: ""URBAN""? But A and N eliminated.

This is difficult.

Perhaps I in the first position: I R _ _ _

We need a word that starts with IR and then three letters not eliminated.

Possible: 
- I R O N? 4 letters.
- I R A D E? A and E out.
- I R I D? Not 5 letters.

""IRIDS""? But S eliminated.

""IRING""? G is allowed, but not a common word.

""IRATE"" is out.

Perhaps we can use Y? Like ""IRONY"" but N eliminated.

Another idea: put I in the fifth position: _ R _ _ I

Words:
- T R O P I? Not a word.
- C R U M I? C eliminated.
- D R O I D? But that has I in fourth, not fifth.

For fifth position: the last letter is I.

Words ending with I: usually from other languages, but there are some.

For example:
- T U R F I? Not a word.
- M U R K I? M, U, R, K, I -> but K is eliminated.
- P O R G I? Not a word.
- H O R D I? Not a word.

""TAXI"" is 4 letters.

""RABBI"" is 5 letters: R, A, B, B, I -> but A and B eliminated.

This is challenging.

Perhaps we can try a word that has I in the fourth position and uses common letters.

Let me think of common words with R in second and I in fourth.

For example: ""DRUID"" -> D, R, U, I, D. This is a valid word. It has I in the fourth position? D(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), D(5). Yes.

And it uses D, U, I. We know I is present, and D and U are new.

Also, it avoids eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, B, S, K.

So ""DRUID"" is a valid guess.

But it has two D's. That's okay.

Another possibility: ""FROID""? Not a word.

""GROIN"" has N.

""PRIM"" is 4 letters.

So ""DRUID"" seems acceptable.

But let's see if there is a word without duplicate letters.

For example, ""TROIS""? T, R, O, I, S -> but S is eliminated.

""ORRIS"" has S.

""URBAN"" has A and N.

""CRIMP"" has C.

So ""DRUID"" might be one of the few options.

We can also consider ""GRIFT"" but F and T, but no I? GRIFT: G, R, I, F, T -> I is in the third position, which we know is not allowed because in BRISK, I was in third and was wrong position. So if we put I in third again, it will be wrong again, but we already know that. We want to test I in a new position.

So ""GRIFT"" has I in third, which is not helpful for finding the position of I.

Therefore, we should avoid putting I in the third position.

So back to ""DRUID"": it has I in the fourth position, which is new.

We can also test other letters.

Another word: ""PROIN""? Not a word.

""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T -> positions: F(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), T(5). This is a valid word. And it has I in the fourth position.

And it uses F, U, I, T. All new letters except I.

And no duplicates.

Also, avoids eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, B, S, K.

So ""FRUIT"" is a better choice than ""DRUID"" because it has distinct letters.

We can test F, U, I, T.

I is already known to be present, but we are testing its position (fourth).

If the feedback shows I is not in fourth, then we know it must be in first or fifth.

But if it is in fourth, then we get a '-' or a '✓' for that position.

In ""FRUIT"", I is in the fourth position, so if the secret word has I in fourth, we get a '✓' for I, or if not, we get a '-' if it's in the word but not fourth, but we know it's not in third, so if not fourth, then it must be in first or fifth.

But we are also testing F, U, T.

So ""FRUIT"" seems a good guess.

Another option: ""TRUMP"" but no I.

We must include I.

So I think ""FRUIT"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""FRUIT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the correct position (second letter).  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: BRISK** → Feedback: B(x), R(✓), I(-), S(x), K(x)  
  - R is still in the correct position (second letter).  
  - I is in the word but not in the third position.  
  - B, S, K are not in the word.  

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ R _ _ _` (R is fixed in the second position).  
- I is present in the word but cannot be in the third position (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5).  
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, A, N, E, B, S, K.  
- Available letters to use: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Must include I** in a new position (1, 4, or 5) to test its location.  
- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize common remaining letters (e.g., F, T, U, O, P) to maximize information gain.  
- The word ""FRUIT"" is chosen because:  
  - It fits the pattern `_ R _ _ _` with R in the second position.  
  - It places I in the fourth position (a new position to test).  
  - It uses new, common letters (F, U, T) that haven't been tested yet.  
  - It avoids all eliminated letters (C, A, N, E, B, S, K).  
  - Feedback will help narrow down the position of I and reveal if F, U, or T are in the word.  

<guess>FRUIT</guess>",FRUIT,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: BRISK
- B: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- K: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The second letter is R.
2. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, B, S, K.
3. The letter I is in the word but not in the third position (since in BRISK it was in the third position and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Second letter: R
- Contains the letter I, but not in the third position. So I must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5.

Also, the word does not contain: C, A, N, E, B, S, K.

We have the pattern: _ R _ _ _

And we know I is in the word but not in the third position.

Available letters: We must avoid C, A, N, E, B, S, K. So we can use other common letters like D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Contains the letter I (but not in the third position).
- Uses only letters that are not eliminated.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down.

The positions for I: it can be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Let's think of words that fit:

Pattern: [I?] R [not I] [I?] [I?]

But we don't know which of the other positions have I. We must include I in one of the first, fourth, or fifth positions.

We can try to put I in the first position? Then the word would be I R _ _ _

But we need to fill the last three letters with letters not eliminated and form a valid word.

Words starting with IR: IRATE (but A and E are eliminated), IRONY (O and N, but N is eliminated), IRKED (K and E eliminated), so not many options.

What about I in the fourth position? Then pattern: _ R _ I _

Or I in the fifth position: _ R _ _ I

We need to choose a word that tests new letters.

Since we have limited information, we should try to cover more ground.

We know I is in the word, so we can try to place it in a different position to see where it belongs.

For example, if we put I in the first position, we can test that. But as above, it might be hard to form a word without eliminated letters.

Alternatively, we can put I in the fourth or fifth and test other vowels or consonants.

We have eliminated A, E, so the remaining vowels are I (which we know is present), O, U, and sometimes Y.

We should test O and U if possible.

Let me try to form a word with I in the fourth position: _ R _ I _

We need to choose the first, third, and fifth letters.

First letter: can be D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, etc.

Third letter: same, but cannot be I.

Fifth letter: same.

For example:
- T R U I P? TRUIP? Not a word.
- D R O I D? DROID? That's a word. But DROID: D, R, O, I, D. But we have D twice? And O is a new letter.

But let's check: DROID is a valid word? Yes, meaning a robot.

But note: we have two D's? The word DROID has D at position 1 and 5.

But we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The feedback so far doesn't indicate duplicates, but it's possible.

But for testing, it's okay.

However, we are testing D, O, and I (which we know is present). But we are not testing many new letters because we are using D twice.

Alternatively, we can try a word with I in the fifth position: _ R _ _ I

For example:
- T R O P I? TROPI? Not a word. But TROPIC is 6 letters. 
- H O R D I? HORDI? Not a word.
- G R O I N? GROIN? But N is eliminated.

We need to avoid N.

Another: F R O T H I? Too long.

Perhaps I in the first position: I R _ _ _

Words: 
- I R I S H? But S is eliminated and we have two I's? Also, S is out.
- I R O N Y? N is eliminated.
- I R A T E? A and E eliminated.
- I R U M P? Not a word.

This is tricky.

What about I in the fourth position? Let me list some words:

- PROUD? But we have O and U, but no I. We must include I because we know it's in the word.

We must include I.

Another idea: put I in the fifth position and use a common word.

For example: 
- T R U M P? But no I. 
- D R I P Y? D, R, I, P, Y -> but I is in the third position? We know I cannot be in the third position because in the second guess (BRISK) I was in the third and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put I in the third again, it would be wrong again? But we want to test other positions.

We need to put I in a new position: either 1, 4, or 5.

Let me try position 4: _ R _ I _

Possible words:
- C R A M I? C and A eliminated.
- F R O T I? Not a word.
- G R I M Y? But I is in the third? We need I in the fourth? GRIMY has I in the fourth? G-R-I-M-Y -> positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:I, 4:M, 5:Y -> so I is in the third, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

We need I in the fourth position: so the fourth letter is I.

So pattern: _ R _ I _

The third letter must not be I, and the first and fifth can be other letters.

Words: 
- T R U I T? TRUIT? Not a word.
- D R O I D? DROID: D (1), R (2), O (3), I (4), D (5). This is a valid word. And it uses D and O.

But we are using D twice. Is that a problem? Not necessarily, but it might not be efficient for information.

Another word: P R O I T? Not a word.

F R I T H? But I is in third? No, if we want I in fourth, then F R ? I ? 

How about ""TRIED""? But E is eliminated.

""ORRIS""? But S is eliminated and no I in fourth? ORRIS: O, R, R, I, S -> but S eliminated and I is in fourth? O(1), R(2), R(3), I(4), S(5) -> but S is out.

Another: ""URBAN""? But A and N eliminated.

This is difficult.

Perhaps I in the first position: I R _ _ _

We need a word that starts with IR and then three letters not eliminated.

Possible: 
- I R O N? 4 letters.
- I R A D E? A and E out.
- I R I D? Not 5 letters.

""IRIDS""? But S eliminated.

""IRING""? G is allowed, but not a common word.

""IRATE"" is out.

Perhaps we can use Y? Like ""IRONY"" but N eliminated.

Another idea: put I in the fifth position: _ R _ _ I

Words:
- T R O P I? Not a word.
- C R U M I? C eliminated.
- D R O I D? But that has I in fourth, not fifth.

For fifth position: the last letter is I.

Words ending with I: usually from other languages, but there are some.

For example:
- T U R F I? Not a word.
- M U R K I? M, U, R, K, I -> but K is eliminated.
- P O R G I? Not a word.
- H O R D I? Not a word.

""TAXI"" is 4 letters.

""RABBI"" is 5 letters: R, A, B, B, I -> but A and B eliminated.

This is challenging.

Perhaps we can try a word that has I in the fourth position and uses common letters.

Let me think of common words with R in second and I in fourth.

For example: ""DRUID"" -> D, R, U, I, D. This is a valid word. It has I in the fourth position? D(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), D(5). Yes.

And it uses D, U, I. We know I is present, and D and U are new.

Also, it avoids eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, B, S, K.

So ""DRUID"" is a valid guess.

But it has two D's. That's okay.

Another possibility: ""FROID""? Not a word.

""GROIN"" has N.

""PRIM"" is 4 letters.

So ""DRUID"" seems acceptable.

But let's see if there is a word without duplicate letters.

For example, ""TROIS""? T, R, O, I, S -> but S is eliminated.

""ORRIS"" has S.

""URBAN"" has A and N.

""CRIMP"" has C.

So ""DRUID"" might be one of the few options.

We can also consider ""GRIFT"" but F and T, but no I? GRIFT: G, R, I, F, T -> I is in the third position, which we know is not allowed because in BRISK, I was in third and was wrong position. So if we put I in third again, it will be wrong again, but we already know that. We want to test I in a new position.

So ""GRIFT"" has I in third, which is not helpful for finding the position of I.

Therefore, we should avoid putting I in the third position.

So back to ""DRUID"": it has I in the fourth position, which is new.

We can also test other letters.

Another word: ""PROIN""? Not a word.

""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T -> positions: F(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), T(5). This is a valid word. And it has I in the fourth position.

And it uses F, U, I, T. All new letters except I.

And no duplicates.

Also, avoids eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, B, S, K.

So ""FRUIT"" is a better choice than ""DRUID"" because it has distinct letters.

We can test F, U, I, T.

I is already known to be present, but we are testing its position (fourth).

If the feedback shows I is not in fourth, then we know it must be in first or fifth.

But if it is in fourth, then we get a '-' or a '✓' for that position.

In ""FRUIT"", I is in the fourth position, so if the secret word has I in fourth, we get a '✓' for I, or if not, we get a '-' if it's in the word but not fourth, but we know it's not in third, so if not fourth, then it must be in first or fifth.

But we are also testing F, U, T.

So ""FRUIT"" seems a good guess.

Another option: ""TRUMP"" but no I.

We must include I.

So I think ""FRUIT"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""FRUIT"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the correct position (second letter).  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: BRISK** → Feedback: B(x), R(✓), I(-), S(x), K(x)  
  - R is still in the correct position (second letter).  
  - I is in the word but not in the third position.  
  - B, S, K are not in the word.  

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ R _ _ _` (R is fixed in the second position).  
- I is present in the word but cannot be in the third position (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5).  
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, A, N, E, B, S, K.  
- Available letters to use: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Must include I** in a new position (1, 4, or 5) to test its location.  
- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize common remaining letters (e.g., F, T, U, O, P) to maximize information gain.  
- The word ""FRUIT"" is chosen because:  
  - It fits the pattern `_ R _ _ _` with R in the second position.  
  - It places I in the fourth position (a new position to test).  
  - It uses new, common letters (F, U, T) that haven't been tested yet.  
  - It avoids all eliminated letters (C, A, N, E, B, S, K).  
  - Feedback will help narrow down the position of I and reveal if F, U, or T are in the word.",Guess 3: FRUIT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) U(✓) I(✓) T(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since there are no prior guesses, we need an initial guess. 
 A good starting strategy is to choose a word that covers common letters and has a good spread of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc. because they have common letters.

 Let's go with ""SLATE"". It has 'S', 'L', 'A', 'T', 'E'. These are common letters.<thinking>
For my first guess, I want a word that includes common English letters to maximize information gain. The word should have a mix of vowels and consonants. ""ROATE"" is statistically a strong starter because it contains common letters like 'R', 'O', 'A', 'E', and avoids repeats. However, I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it also covers frequent letters ('C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E') and fits the 5-letter requirement. This guess will provide feedback on five distinct letters, helping me quickly eliminate or confirm letter presence and positions.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter of the secret word is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in our next guess.

We have 5 more tries (since one is used).

For the next guess, we want to use a word that:
- Has R in the second position (to keep that confirmed position and test others).
- Uses other common letters that haven't been eliminated (so avoid C, A, N, E).
- Tries to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Common letters in English (excluding C, A, N, E) include: S, T, B, D, H, I, O, U, L, M, P, etc.

We can form a word that fits: _ R _ _ _

Let's think of words that have R in the second position and don't contain C, A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- TRYST (T, R, Y, S, T) -> but has T twice and Y is less common.
- PROUD (P, R, O, U, D) -> good, but we have O and U which are vowels.
- BRISK (B, R, I, S, K) -> this is a good one, but we don't know if B is allowed? We haven't eliminated B.

Wait, we haven't used B, I, S, K, etc. So let's consider:

We know the word must have R in the second position. So the pattern is: [letter] R [letter] [letter] [letter]

We can try to use a word that includes common consonants and vowels that are still available.

Available vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out, and sometimes Y but we can avoid for now).

Let me list some words:
- BRUSH (B, R, U, S, H) -> contains U and S, H.
- DRUID (D, R, U, I, D) -> has D twice, and U, I.
- PRIOR (P, R, I, O, R) -> has R twice and O, but we don't know if R can be repeated? The feedback only showed one R as correct, but it might have more? However, in the first guess, we had only one R and it was correct, but that doesn't rule out another R. But since we are avoiding repetition for information, maybe not.

But note: the feedback for ""CRANE"" showed R as correct and the others as absent. It doesn't tell us if there are duplicate letters. However, since we are trying to maximize information, it's better to use distinct letters if possible.

So, let's try to find a word with R in the second position and four new distinct letters (from the available set).

Available letters: all except C, A, N, E.

I think ""BROIL"" might be a candidate: B, R, O, I, L -> but O and I are vowels.

Another one: ""PRISM"" (P, R, I, S, M) -> this has distinct letters and covers P, I, S, M.

But we don't know if the secret word has a vowel in the first position? It might.

Alternatively, ""TRYST"" has two T's, so not ideal.

""GROUT"" (G, R, O, U, T) -> covers G, O, U, T.

But let's think of a word that uses more common letters.

I recall that in Wordle, after getting one letter, it's good to test other common letters.

We can try ""ROUST"" (R, O, U, S, T) but that would put R in the first position, but we need R in the second.

We must have R in the second position.

So, let's look for words starting with a consonant and then R.

Common starting letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, R (but R is already in second, so first can be any except C, A, N, E).

I think ""PRICK"" (P, R, I, C, K) -> but C is eliminated! We cannot use C.

Similarly, ""BRICK"" has C and is invalid.

""BRINK"" has N, which is eliminated.

So avoid C, A, N, E.

Let me try to form a word: 
- First letter: let's try B -> then we have B R _ _ _
- Then we need three more letters. We can use I, S, T, O, etc.

Word: ""BRISK"" -> B, R, I, S, K -> all letters are allowed (no C, A, N, E). This is a valid word.

Another: ""BRUSH"" -> B, R, U, S, H.

But ""BRISK"" is a common word and covers B, I, S, K.

Alternatively, ""DRIFT"" (D, R, I, F, T) -> but F and T are common.

But we don't know if F is in the word.

I think ""BRISK"" is a good choice because it tests B, I, S, K and keeps R in position.

So, I'll go with ""BRISK"".

But note: we are not sure if B is in the word, but that's the point of guessing.

We are trying to get as much information as possible.

Another option: ""PRISM"" (P, R, I, S, M) -> also good.

Between ""BRISK"" and ""PRISM"", both are good. I'll choose ""BRISK"" because it has K which is less common and might be tested.

But actually, for information, both are similar. Let me see the frequency of letters.

In English, S is very common, so testing S is good. T is also common, but we don't have T in ""BRISK"". We have B, I, S, K.

In ""PRISM"", we have P, I, S, M.

S is in both. I is in both.

B is more common than P? Actually, B is more common than P? Let me recall: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, ...

So P is more common than B? Actually, B is more common than P? No, according to some sources, P is slightly more common than B.

But it doesn't matter much.

We can also consider that we have eliminated A and E, so the vowels left are I, O, U. ""BRISK"" has I, and ""PRISM"" has I. So both test I.

But ""BRISK"" has no O or U, while ""PRISM"" has no O or U either.

I think both are fine. I'll go with ""BRISK"".

So, the next guess is ""BRISK"".<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the correct position (second letter) (✓).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

Key deductions:
- The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _ (R is fixed in the second position).
- The letters C, A, N, and E are eliminated and cannot appear in the word.
- The next guess must include R in the second position and avoid using C, A, N, E.

Strategy for the second guess:
- Focus on words with R in the second position.
- Use common remaining letters (e.g., S, T, B, I, O, L, M, P) to maximize information gain.
- Test new letters to narrow down possibilities.
- ""BRISK"" is a strong candidate because:
  - It has R in the second position.
  - It uses new, common letters (B, I, S, K) that haven't been tested yet.
  - It avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, E).
  - If any of B, I, S, or K are in the secret word, their feedback will provide valuable clues.

Other considered words (like ""PRISM"" or ""BRUSH"") were rejected because ""BRISK"" offers a balanced mix of consonants and a vowel (I) while covering high-frequency letters.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)
- A: x (not in the word)

- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: BRISK
- B: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- K: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The second letter is R.
2. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, B, S, K.
3. The letter I is in the word but not in the third position (since in BRISK it was in the third position and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Second letter: R
- Contains the letter I, but not in the third position. So I must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5.

Also, the word does not contain: C, A, N, E, B, S, K.

We have the pattern: _ R _ _ _

And we know I is in the word but not in the third position.

Available letters: We must avoid C, A, N, E, B, S, K. So we can use other common letters like D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Contains the letter I (but not in the third position).
- Uses only letters that are not eliminated.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down.

The positions for I: it can be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Let's think of words that fit:

Pattern: [I?] R [not I] [I?] [I?]

But we don't know which of the other positions have I. We must include I in one of the first, fourth, or fifth positions.

We can try to put I in the first position? Then the word would be I R _ _ _

But we need to fill the last three letters with letters not eliminated and form a valid word.

Words starting with IR: IRATE (but A and E are eliminated), IRONY (O and N, but N is eliminated), IRKED (K and E eliminated), so not many options.

What about I in the fourth position? Then pattern: _ R _ I _

Or I in the fifth position: _ R _ _ I

We need to choose a word that tests new letters.

Since we have limited information, we should try to cover more ground.

We know I is in the word, so we can try to place it in a different position to see where it belongs.

For example, if we put I in the first position, we can test that. But as above, it might be hard to form a word without eliminated letters.

Alternatively, we can put I in the fourth or fifth and test other vowels or consonants.

We have eliminated A, E, so the remaining vowels are I (which we know is present), O, U, and sometimes Y.

We should test O and U if possible.

Let me try to form a word with I in the fourth position: _ R _ I _

We need to choose the first, third, and fifth letters.

First letter: can be D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, etc.

Third letter: same, but cannot be I.

Fifth letter: same.

For example:
- T R U I P? TRUIP? Not a word.
- D R O I D? DROID? That's a word. But DROID: D, R, O, I, D. But we have D twice? And O is a new letter.

But let's check: DROID is a valid word? Yes, meaning a robot.

But note: we have two D's? The word DROID has D at position 1 and 5.

But we don't know if the word allows duplicates? The feedback so far doesn't indicate duplicates, but it's possible.

But for testing, it's okay.

However, we are testing D, O, and I (which we know is present). But we are not testing many new letters because we are using D twice.

Alternatively, we can try a word with I in the fifth position: _ R _ _ I

For example:
- T R O P I? TROPI? Not a word. But TROPIC is 6 letters. 
- H O R D I? HORDI? Not a word.
- G R O I N? GROIN? But N is eliminated.

We need to avoid N.

Another: F R O T H I? Too long.

Perhaps I in the first position: I R _ _ _

Words: 
- I R I S H? But S is eliminated and we have two I's? Also, S is out.
- I R O N Y? N is eliminated.
- I R A T E? A and E eliminated.
- I R U M P? Not a word.

This is tricky.

What about I in the fourth position? Let me list some words:

- PROUD? But we have O and U, but no I. We must include I because we know it's in the word.

We must include I.

For example: 
- T R U M P? But no I. 
- D R I P Y? D, R, I, P, Y -> but I is in the third position? We know I cannot be in the third position because in the second guess (BRISK) I was in the third and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put I in the third again, it would be wrong again? But we want to test other positions.

We need to put I in a new position: either 1, 4, or 5.

Let me try position 4: _ R _ I _

Possible words:
- C R A M I? C and A eliminated.
- F R O T I? Not a word.
- G R I M Y? But I is in the third? We need I in the fourth? GRIMY has I in the fourth? G-R-I-M-Y -> positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:I, 4:M, 5:Y -> so I is in the third, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

We need I in the fourth position: so the fourth letter is I.

So pattern: _ R _ I _

The third letter must not be I, and the first and fifth can be other letters.

Words: 
- T R U I T? TRUIT? Not a word.
- D R O I D? DROID: D (1), R (2), O (3), I (4), D (5). This is a valid word. And it uses D and O.

But we are using D twice. Is that a problem? Not necessarily, but it might not be efficient for information.

Another word: P R O I T? Not a word.

F R I T H? But I is in third? No, if we want I in fourth, then F R ? I ? 

How about ""TRIED""? But E is eliminated.

""ORRIS""? But S is eliminated and no I in fourth? ORRIS: O, R, R, I, S -> but S eliminated and I is in fourth? O(1), R(2), R(3), I(4), S(5) -> but S is out.

Another: ""URBAN""? But A and N eliminated.

This is difficult.

Perhaps I in the first position: I R _ _ _

We need a word that starts with IR and then three letters not eliminated.

Possible: 
- I R O N? 4 letters.
- I R A D E? A and E out.
- I R I D? Not 5 letters.

""IRIDS""? But S eliminated.

""IRING""? G is allowed, but not a common word.

""IRATE"" is out.

Perhaps we can use Y? Like ""IRONY"" but N eliminated.

Another idea: put I in the fifth position: _ R _ _ I

Words:
- T R O P I? Not a word.
- C R U M I? C eliminated.
- D R O I D? But that has I in fourth, not fifth.

For fifth position: the last letter is I.

Words ending with I: usually from other languages, but there are some.

For example:
- T U R F I? Not a word.
- M U R K I? M, U, R, K, I -> but K is eliminated.
- P O R G I? Not a word.
- H O R D I? Not a word.

""TAXI"" is 4 letters.

""RABBI"" is 5 letters: R, A, B, B, I -> but A and B eliminated.

This is challenging.

Perhaps we can try a word that has I in the fourth position and uses common letters.

Let me think of common words with R in second and I in fourth.

For example: ""DRUID"" -> D, R, U, I, D. This is a valid word. It has I in the fourth position? D(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), D(5). Yes.

And it uses D, U, I. We know I is present, and D and U are new.

Also, it avoids eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, B, S, K.

So ""DRUID"" is a valid guess.

But it has two D's. That's okay.

Another possibility: ""FROID""? Not a word.

""GROIN"" has N.

""PRIM"" is 4 letters.

So ""DRUID"" seems acceptable.

But let's see if there is a word without duplicate letters.

For example, ""TROIS""? T, R, O, I, S -> but S is eliminated.

""ORRIS"" has S.

""URBAN"" has A and N.

""CRIMP"" has C.

So ""DRUID"" might be one of the few options.

We can also consider ""GRIFT"" but F and T, but no I? GRIFT: G, R, I, F, T -> I is in the third position, which we know is not allowed because in BRISK, I was in third and was wrong position. So if we put I in third again, it will be wrong again, but we already know that. We want to test I in a new position.

So ""GRIFT"" has I in third, which is not helpful for finding the position of I.

Therefore, we should avoid putting I in the third position.

So back to ""DRUID"": it has I in the fourth position, which is new.

We can also test other letters.

Another word: ""PROIN""? Not a word.

""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T -> positions: F(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), T(5). This is a valid word. And it has I in the fourth position.

And it uses F, U, I, T. All new letters except I.

And no duplicates.

Also, avoids eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, B, S, K.

So ""FRUIT"" is a better choice than ""DRUID"" because it has distinct letters.

We can test F, U, I, T.

I is already known to be present, but we are testing its position (fourth).

If the feedback shows I is not in fourth, then we know it must be in first or fifth.

But if it is in fourth, then we get a '-' or a '✓' for that position.

In ""FRUIT"", I is in the fourth position, so if the secret word has I in fourth, we get a '✓' for I, or if not, we get a '-' if it's in the word but not fourth, but we know it's not in third, so if not fourth, then it must be in first or fifth.

But we are also testing F, U, T.

So ""FRUIT"" seems a good guess.

Another option: ""TRUMP"" but no I.

We must include I.

So I think ""FRUIT"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""FRUIT"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the correct position (second letter).  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: BRISK** → Feedback: B(x), R(✓), I(-), S(x), K(x)  
  - R is still in the correct position (second letter).  
  - I is in the word but not in the third position.  
  - B, S, K are not in the word.  

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ R _ _ _` (R is fixed in the second position).  
- I is present in the word but cannot be in the third position (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5).  
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, A, N, E, B, S, K.  
- Available letters to use: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Must include I** in a new position (1, 4, or 5) to test its location.  
- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize common remaining letters (e.g., F, T, U, O, P) to maximize information gain.  
- The word ""FRUIT"" is chosen because:  
  - It fits the pattern `_ R _ _ _` with R in the second position.  
  - It places I in the fourth position (a new position to test).  
  - It uses new, common letters (F, U, T) that haven't been tested yet.  
  - It avoids all eliminated letters (C, A, N, E, B, S, K).  
  - Feedback will help narrow down the position of I and reveal if F, U, or T are in the word.

We haven\'t eliminated B.\n\nWait, we haven\'t used B, I, S, K, etc. So let\'s consider:\n\nWe know the word must have R in the second position. So the pattern is: [letter] R [letter] [letter] [letter]\n\nWe can try to use a word that includes common consonants and vowels that are still available.\n\nAvailable vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out, and sometimes Y but we can avoid for now).\n\nLet me list some words:\n- BRUSH (B, R, U, S, H) -> contains U and S, H.\n- DRUID (D, R, U, I, D) -> has D twice, and U, I.\n- PRIOR (P, R, I, O, R) -> has R twice and O, but we don\'t know if R can be repeated? The feedback only showed one R as correct, but it might have more? However, in the first guess, we had only one R and it was correct, but that doesn\'t rule out another R. But since we are avoiding repetition for information, maybe not.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""CRANE"" showed R as correct and the others as absent. It doesn\'t tell us if there are duplicate letters. However, since we are trying to maximize information, it\'s better to use distinct letters if possible.\n\nSo, let\'s try to find a word with R in the second position and four new distinct letters (from the available set).\n\nAvailable letters: all except C, A, N, E.\n\nI think ""BROIL"" might be a candidate: B, R, O, I, L -> but O and I are vowels.\n\nAnother one: ""PRISM"" (P, R, I, S, M) -> this has distinct letters and covers P, I, S, M.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the secret word has a vowel in the first position? It might.\n\nAlternatively, ""TRYST"" has two T\'s, so not ideal.\n\n""GROUT"" (G, R, O, U, T) -> covers G, O, U, T.\n\nBut let\'s think of a word that uses more common letters.\n\nI recall that in Wordle, after getting one letter, it\'s good to test other common letters.\n\nWe can try ""ROUST"" (R, O, U, S, T) but that would put R in the first position, but we need R in the second.\n\nWe must have R in the second position.\n\nSo, let\'s look for words starting with a consonant and then R.\n\nCommon starting letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, R (but R is already in second, so first can be any except C, A, N, E).\n\nI think ""PRICK"" (P, R, I, C, K) -> but C is eliminated! We cannot use C.\n\nSimilarly, ""BRICK"" has C and is invalid.\n\n""BRINK"" has N, which is eliminated.\n\nSo avoid C, A, N, E.\n\nLet me try to form a word: \n- First letter: let\'s try B -> then we have B R _ _ _\n- Then we need three more letters. We can use I, S, T, O, etc.\n\nWord: ""BRISK"" -> B, R, I, S, K -> all letters are allowed (no C, A, N, E). This is a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""BRUSH"" -> B, R, U, S, H.\n\nBut ""BRISK"" is a common word and covers B, I, S, K.\n\nAlternatively, ""DRIFT"" (D, R, I, F, T) -> but F and T are common.\n\nBut we don\'t know if F is in the word.\n\nI think ""BRISK"" is a good choice because it tests B, I, S, K and keeps R in position.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""BRISK"".\n\nBut note: we are not sure if B is in the word, but that\'s the point of guessing.\n\nWe are trying to get as much information as possible.\n\nAnother option: ""PRISM"" (P, R, I, S, M) -> also good.\n\nBetween ""BRISK"" and ""PRISM"", both are good. I\'ll choose ""BRISK"" because it has K which is less common and might be tested.\n\nBut actually, for information, both are similar. Let me see the frequency of letters.\n\nIn English, S is very common, so testing S is good. T is also common, but we don\'t have T in ""BRISK"". We have B, I, S, K.\n\nIn ""PRISM"", we have P, I, S, M.\n\nS is in both. I is in both.\n\nB is more common than P? Actually, B is more common than P? Let me recall: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, ...\n\nSo P is more common than B? Actually, B is more common than P? No, according to some sources, P is slightly more common than B.\n\nBut it doesn\'t matter much.\n\nWe can also consider that we have eliminated A and E, so the vowels left are I, O, U. ""BRISK"" has I, and ""PRISM"" has I. So both test I.\n\nBut ""BRISK"" has no O or U, while ""PRISM"" has no O or U either.\n\nI think both are fine. I\'ll go with ""BRISK"".\n\nSo, the next guess is ""BRISK"".<thinking>\nBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C is not in the word (x).\n- R is in the correct position (second letter) (✓).\n- A is not in the word (x).\n- N is not in the word (x).\n- E is not in the word (x).\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _ (R is fixed in the second position).\n- The letters C, A, N, and E are eliminated and cannot appear in the word.\n- The next guess must include R in the second position and avoid using C, A, N, E.\n\nStrategy for the second guess:\n- Focus on words with R in the second position.\n- Use common remaining letters (e.g., S, T, B, I, O, L, M, P) to maximize information gain.\n- Test new letters to narrow down possibilities.\n- ""BRISK"" is a strong candidate because:\n  - It has R in the second position.\n  - It uses new, common letters (B, I, S, K) that haven\'t been tested yet.\n  - It avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, E).\n  - If any of B, I, S, or K are in the secret word, their feedback will provide valuable clues.\n\nOther considered words (like ""PRISM"" or ""BRUSH"") were rejected because ""BRISK"" offers a balanced mix of consonants and a vowel (I) while covering high-frequency letters.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>BRISK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: BRISK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(-) S(x) K(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: BRISK\n- B: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)\n- I: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- K: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\n1. The second letter is R.\n2. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, B, S, K.\n3. The letter I is in the word but not in the third position (since in BRISK it was in the third position and got a \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not there).\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Second letter: R\n- Contains the letter I, but not in the third position. So I must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5.\n\nAlso, the word does not contain: C, A, N, E, B, S, K.\n\nWe have the pattern: _ R _ _ _\n\nAnd we know I is in the word but not in the third position.\n\nAvailable letters: We must avoid C, A, N, E, B, S, K.

We must include I in one of the first, fourth, or fifth positions.\n\nWe can try to put I in the first position? Then the word would be I R _ _ _\n\nBut we need to fill the last three letters with letters not eliminated and form a valid word.\n\nWords starting with IR: IRATE (but A and E are eliminated), IRONY (O and N, but N is eliminated), IRKED (K and E eliminated), so not many options.\n\nWhat about I in the fourth position? Then pattern: _ R _ I _\n\nOr I in the fifth position: _ R _ _ I\n\nWe need to choose a word that tests new letters.\n\nSince we have limited information, we should try to cover more ground.\n\nWe know I is in the word, so we can try to place it in a different position to see where it belongs.\n\nFor example, if we put I in the first position, we can test that. But as above, it might be hard to form a word without eliminated letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can put I in the fourth or fifth and test other vowels or consonants.\n\nWe have eliminated A, E, so the remaining vowels are I (which we know is present), O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nWe should test O and U if possible.\n\nLet me try to form a word with I in the fourth position: _ R _ I _\n\nWe need to choose the first, third, and fifth letters.\n\nFirst letter: can be D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, etc.\n\nThird letter: same, but cannot be I.\n\nFifth letter: same.\n\nFor example:\n- T R U I P? TRUIP? Not a word.\n- D R O I D? DROID? That\'s a word. But DROID: D, R, O, I, D. But we have D twice? And O is a new letter.\n\nBut let\'s check: DROID is a valid word? Yes, meaning a robot.\n\nBut note: we have two D\'s? The word DROID has D at position 1 and 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates? The feedback so far doesn\'t indicate duplicates, but it\'s possible.\n\nBut for testing, it\'s okay.\n\nHowever, we are testing D, O, and I (which we know is present). But we are not testing many new letters because we are using D twice.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with I in the fifth position: _ R _ _ I\n\nFor example:\n- T R O P I? TROPI? Not a word. But TROPIC is 6 letters. \n- H O R D I? HORDI? Not a word.\n- G R O I N? GROIN? But N is eliminated.\n\nWe need to avoid N.\n\nAnother: F R O T H I? Too long.\n\nPerhaps I in the first position: I R _ _ _\n\nWords: \n- I R I S H? But S is eliminated and we have two I\'s? Also, S is out.\n- I R O N Y? N is eliminated.\n- I R A T E? A and E eliminated.\n- I R U M P? Not a word.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nWhat about I in the fourth position? Let me list some words:\n\n- PROUD? But we have O and U, but no I. We must include I because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nWe must include I.\n\nAnother idea: put I in the fifth position and use a common word.\n\nFor example: \n- T R U M P? But no I. \n- D R I P Y? D, R, I, P, Y -> but I is in the third position? We know I cannot be in the third position because in the second guess (BRISK) I was in the third and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put I in the third again, it would be wrong again? But we want to test other positions.\n\nWe need to put I in a new position: either 1, 4, or 5.\n\nLet me try position 4: _ R _ I _\n\nPossible words:\n- C R A M I? C and A eliminated.\n- F R O T I? Not a word.\n- G R I M Y? But I is in the third? We need I in the fourth? GRIMY has I in the fourth? G-R-I-M-Y -> positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:I, 4:M, 5:Y -> so I is in the third, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.\n\nWe need I in the fourth position: so the fourth letter is I.\n\nSo pattern: _ R _ I _\n\nThe third letter must not be I, and the first and fifth can be other letters.\n\nWords: \n- T R U I T? TRUIT? Not a word.\n- D R O I D? DROID: D (1), R (2), O (3), I (4), D (5). This is a valid word. And it uses D and O.\n\nBut we are using D twice. Is that a problem? Not necessarily, but it might not be efficient for information.\n\nAnother word: P R O I T? Not a word.\n\nF R I T H? But I is in third? No, if we want I in fourth, then F R ? I ? \n\nHow about ""TRIED""? But E is eliminated.\n\n""ORRIS""? But S is eliminated and no I in fourth? ORRIS: O, R, R, I, S -> but S eliminated and I is in fourth? O(1), R(2), R(3), I(4), S(5) -> but S is out.\n\nAnother: ""URBAN""? But A and N eliminated.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nPerhaps I in the first position: I R _ _ _\n\nWe need a word that starts with IR and then three letters not eliminated.\n\nPossible: \n- I R O N? 4 letters.\n- I R A D E? A and E out.\n- I R I D? Not 5 letters.\n\n""IRIDS""? But S eliminated.\n\n""IRING""? G is allowed, but not a common word.\n\n""IRATE"" is out.\n\nPerhaps we can use Y?

Not a word.\n- M U R K I? M, U, R, K, I -> but K is eliminated.\n- P O R G I? Not a word.\n- H O R D I? Not a word.\n\n""TAXI"" is 4 letters.\n\n""RABBI"" is 5 letters: R, A, B, B, I -> but A and B eliminated.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nPerhaps we can try a word that has I in the fourth position and uses common letters.\n\nLet me think of common words with R in second and I in fourth.\n\nFor example: ""DRUID"" -> D, R, U, I, D. This is a valid word. It has I in the fourth position? D(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), D(5). Yes.\n\nAnd it uses D, U, I. We know I is present, and D and U are new.\n\nAlso, it avoids eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, B, S, K.\n\nSo ""DRUID"" is a valid guess.\n\nBut it has two D\'s. That\'s okay.\n\nAnother possibility: ""FROID""? Not a word.\n\n""GROIN"" has N.\n\n""PRIM"" is 4 letters.\n\nSo ""DRUID"" seems acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word without duplicate letters.\n\nFor example, ""TROIS""? T, R, O, I, S -> but S is eliminated.\n\n""ORRIS"" has S.\n\n""URBAN"" has A and N.\n\n""CRIMP"" has C.\n\nSo ""DRUID"" might be one of the few options.\n\nWe can also consider ""GRIFT"" but F and T, but no I? GRIFT: G, R, I, F, T -> I is in the third position, which we know is not allowed because in BRISK, I was in third and was wrong position. So if we put I in third again, it will be wrong again, but we already know that. We want to test I in a new position.\n\nSo ""GRIFT"" has I in third, which is not helpful for finding the position of I.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid putting I in the third position.\n\nSo back to ""DRUID"": it has I in the fourth position, which is new.\n\nWe can also test other letters.\n\nAnother word: ""PROIN""? Not a word.\n\n""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T -> positions: F(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), T(5). This is a valid word. And it has I in the fourth position.\n\nAnd it uses F, U, I, T. All new letters except I.\n\nAnd no duplicates.\n\nAlso, avoids eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, B, S, K.\n\nSo ""FRUIT"" is a better choice than ""DRUID"" because it has distinct letters.\n\nWe can test F, U, I, T.\n\nI is already known to be present, but we are testing its position (fourth).\n\nIf the feedback shows I is not in fourth, then we know it must be in first or fifth.\n\nBut if it is in fourth, then we get a \'-\' or a \'✓\' for that position.\n\nIn ""FRUIT"", I is in the fourth position, so if the secret word has I in fourth, we get a \'✓\' for I, or if not, we get a \'-\' if it\'s in the word but not fourth, but we know it\'s not in third, so if not fourth, then it must be in first or fifth.\n\nBut we are also testing F, U, T.\n\nSo ""FRUIT"" seems a good guess.\n\nAnother option: ""TRUMP"" but no I.\n\nWe must include I.\n\nSo I think ""FRUIT"" is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""FRUIT"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  \n  - R is in the correct position (second letter).  \n  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: BRISK** → Feedback: B(x), R(✓), I(-), S(x), K(x)  \n  - R is still in the correct position (second letter).  \n  - I is in the word but not in the third position.  \n  - B, S, K are not in the word.  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ R _ _ _` (R is fixed in the second position).  \n- I is present in the word but cannot be in the third position (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5).  \n- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, A, N, E, B, S, K.  \n- Available letters to use: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Must include I** in a new position (1, 4, or 5) to test its location.  \n- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize common remaining letters (e.g., F, T, U, O, P) to maximize information gain.  \n- The word ""FRUIT"" is chosen because:  \n  - It fits the pattern `_ R _ _ _` with R in the second position.  \n  - It places I in the fourth position (a new position to test).  \n  - It uses new, common letters (F, U, T) that haven\'t been tested yet.  \n  - It avoids all eliminated letters (C, A, N, E, B, S, K).  \n  - Feedback will help narrow down the position of I and reveal if F, U, or T are in the word.\n\n<guess>FRUIT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: BRISK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(-) S(x) K(x)\nGuess 3: FRUIT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) U(✓) I(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: BRISK
- B: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter is R)
- I: - (in the word but not in the third position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- K: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: FRUIT
- F: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter is R)
- U: ✓ (correct position, third letter is U)
- I: ✓ (correct position, fourth letter is I)
- T: x (not in the word)

From Guess 3, we have:
- U is in the correct third position: so the word is _ R U _ _
- I is in the correct fourth position: so the word is _ R U I _
- F is not in the word, T is not in the word.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we know:
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, E, B, S, K, F, T.
- I is confirmed in the fourth position.

Now, the pattern is: _ R U I _

We need to find the first letter (position 1) and the fifth letter (position 5).

The fifth letter is still unknown.

Available letters: We must avoid C, A, N, E, B, S, K, F, T.

Common letters left: D, G, H, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Since the word must be a valid English word ending with R U I, common words might be ""FRUIT"" but we have that, and F and T are out.

Other words: 
- CRUCI? Not a word.
- DRUID? But D is available? Let's see: D, R, U, I, D -> but fifth letter would be D? But ""DRUID"" has I in fourth? Wait, ""DRUID"" is D-R-U-I-D, so fifth letter D.

But we need _ R U I _, so the fifth letter is the last.

Possible words: 
- BRUIN? But B is eliminated.
- GRUIN? Not a word.
- TRUIS? Not a word.

Common words: 
- ""FRUMP""? But F is eliminated and it's in the pattern? F-R-U-M-P, but F is out and pattern requires first letter unknown, but F is not allowed.

What other words end with ""UI"" rarely, but let's think.

Perhaps ""ENNUI"" but E and N eliminated, and it starts with E.

Another one: ""MUSUI""? Not a word.

""URUMI""? Not a word.

Perhaps we're missing something.

Another common word: ""CRUFT""? But C and F eliminated.

But we have R U I fixed.

Perhaps ""DRU"" something.

""DRUID"": D-R-U-I-D -> that would be positions: D(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), D(5). So it fits _ R U I _ with the same D? But that's possible.

""DRUID"" is D-R-U-I-D.

So pattern: letter1=R, letter2=U, letter3=I? No, in our pattern, we have R at position 2, U at 3, I at 4, so for ""DRUID"": position1=D, position2=R, position3=U, position4=I, position5=D. So yes, it fits: D R U I D.

But is ""DRUID"" considered to have position 5 as D? Yes.

Feedback for guess 3: FRUIT got U and I correct, meaning U is third, I is fourth.

So secret word has U at third, I at fourth.

Therefore, secret word: ? R U I ?

We need to fill first and fifth.

Possible words: 
- ""DRUID"": D and D
- ""GRUIN""? Not a word.
- ""PRUIN""? Not standard.
- ""BRUIN"": B-R-U-I-N -> but B and N eliminated.

""TRUIS"" no.

""FRUITION"" too long.

""DENUI"" no.

""KRULI"" K eliminated.

What about ""ORUIM""? Not a word.

""URIM"" too short.

I think ""DRUID"" is a candidate, and D is not eliminated.

But we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, B, S, K, F, T.

So D is available.

If the secret word is ""DRUID"", it must be spelled D-R-U-I-D.

But let me confirm.

Are there other words?

Another possibility: ""DRUIT"" but T is eliminated.

""SQUID"" but S is eliminated.

""VLUIZ"" not a word.

""GROIN"" has O but N eliminated and no U,I in pattern.

After thinking, ""DRUID"" seems like a possible word that fits.

But it has two D's.

We haven't tested D, so it could be.

Another word: ""FRUIT"" is the only common one, but not.

""CRIMP"" not.

Perhaps ""VIRUS"" but S eliminated and V I R U S -> positions: V(1), I(2), R(3), U(4), S(5) -> but R is third, not second.

Doesn't match our pattern.

Our pattern is ? R U I ?

Letters must be R at 2, U at 3, I at 4.

So words like:
- A R U I S? But A eliminated and S eliminated.
- E R U I D? But E eliminated.
- I R U I ? Not common.
- O R U I N? N eliminated.

So actually, ""DRUID"" might be the only common word fitting: D R U I D.

Perhaps ""PROUD"" but P R O U D -> U is fourth, I is not present? But we need I at fourth.

PR U D? No.

R U I must be positions 3-4-5? No, in our case it's 2-3-4: positions 2=R, 3=U, 4=I.

So ? R U I ?

With fifth letter to be filled.

So the word has four letters fixed: R U I at positions 2,3,4, and first and fifth are variables.

Valid words:
- ""DRUID"" - D R U I D
- ""ARGUS"" doesn't have I.
- ""BEGUILE"" too long.
- ""MINUET"" no.

I think ""DRUID"" is the strongest candidate.

Perhaps ""GRUEL"" but E and L not fitting.

Another: ""PRUIDE""? Not a word.

""DRU"" is root.

Perhaps ""DRUM"" doesn't have I.

So I think ""DRUID"" is the word.

But in our feedback, we have I not in third position, but in ""DRUID"" I is in fourth, which is consistent.

Also, U is correct.

Moreover, we haven't eliminated D.

So we should guess ""DRUID"".

But note: in ""DRUID"", the letter D appears twice. We don't know if that's allowed, but it might be.

Perhaps the word is ""ORCIN"" but N eliminated, no U.

I think ""DRUID"" is our best bet.

Alternatively, let's see if there is a word with a different first letter.

What about ""ORUIS""? Not a word.

""YARUI""? No.

I think we should go with ""DRUID"".

So next guess: ""DRUID"".

But let's think about the feedback.

From guess2: I is present but not in third → correct, since in ""DRUID"" I is in fourth.

Guess3: U and I in correct position → matches.

And fifth letter D and first D.

So we don't know D, but guessing ""DRUID"" will test it.

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: Eliminated letters C, A, N, E. Confirmed R is in position 2 (✓).
   - **Guess 2 (BRISK)**: Eliminated letters B, S, K. Confirmed I is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
   - **Guess 3 (FRUIT)**: Eliminated letters F, T. Confirmed:
     - R is in position 2 (✓).
     - U is in position 3 (✓).
     - I is in position 4 (✓).
   - **Pattern**: Secret word pattern is `_ R U I _` (positions: 1 unknown, 2=R, 3=U, 4=I, 5 unknown).
   - **Eliminated Letters**: C, A, N, E, B, S, K, F, T (9 letters total).

2. **Deductions**:
   - The word must be 5 letters with `R` in position 2, `U` in position 3, and `I` in position 4.
   - Eliminated letters cannot appear, leaving possible letters: D, G, H, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.
   - Position 1 and 5 require new letters to be tested. Position 5 is critical as it completes the word.

3. **Identify Possible Words**:
   - **Constraints**: Word must match `_ R U I _` and use available letters.
   - **Valid Words**:
     - Only common 5-letter English word fitting the pattern: **DRUID** (D-R-U-I-D).
     - **Why ""DRUID""?** 
       - Avoids all eliminated letters (letters D, R, U, I are allowed—R and I confirmed).
       - Position 1 = D (new letter), Position 5 = D (new letter).
       - It tests whether D exists in positions 1/5 and reveals if duplicates are allowed (since D appears twice).
     - Other words like ""BRUIN"" (B and N eliminated), ""FRUMP"" (F eliminated), or ""CRUIS"" (C and S eliminated) are invalid.

4. **Strategy**:
   - Focus letters on position 1 and 5. ""DRUID"" efficiently tests D in both slots and provides feedback on duplicates.
   - If ""DRUID"" is not the word, feedback will reveal missing letters for position 5 (e.g., `D(x)` in position 1/5). This limits it to rarer choices like ""GRUID"" (obscure) or ""PRUID"" (invalid), but ""DRUID"" is the only viable option.
   - Goal: Confirm position 1/5 and resolve the word with minimal guesses left (3 tries remaining).
