We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)

 This means:
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2). So the second letter of the secret word is R.
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it's present, but not in the first position? Note: our guess had A in position 3 because C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)). Therefore, A is somewhere in the word but not in position 3.
 - C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has:
   Position 2: R
   Contains A, but not at position 3.
   Does not contain C, N, E.

 Therefore, the word is of the form: _ R _ _ _

 Since A is not at position 3 and also not at position 2 (which is R), it must be at position 1, 4, or 5.

 But note: we also know A cannot be at position 1? Why? Because we don't have information about position 1 yet. Actually, it could be at position 1, 4, or 5.

 We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We know we cannot use C, N, E again. We must use A again, and we know R is fixed at position 2.

 For our next guess, we want to maximize the information. We should try to test common letters and also try to place A in possible positions.

 Since A is known to be in the word but not at position 3, let's try to put A in a different position to see if it fits.

 Also, we need to avoid the letters C, N, E.

 Possibilities for A: position 1, 4, or 5.

 Let me think of words that have R as the second letter, contain A, and do not contain C, N, E.

 Some common words: 
   We can try ""PARTY"" -> but we are avoiding the letter E? Wait, E is out, but T and Y are new.

 However, note: we have limited knowledge. Another idea: we could try a word that uses other common vowels and consonants.

 But we also know that the word doesn't contain E, so vowels we can use are: A (we know), and others like I, O, U.

 Also, we haven't tried letters like T, S, L, etc.

 Let me think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and include A (somewhere but position 3) and exclude C, N, E.

 Examples:
   BRAVO? -> But we have O, which we haven't tested. Also, we have B and V. And A would be at position 3? Wait, position 3 is the third letter -> BRAVO: B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), O(5). But our feedback said A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback for our guess ""crane"" had A at position 3 and said A(-) meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So putting A at position 3 in a new guess would be inconsistent? Actually, in the new guess we can put it anywhere because we are testing. But note: we know that if we put A at position 3 in a new guess and it turns out to be correct, then we might misinterpret the feedback? Actually, the feedback will tell us if the letter is correct.

 However, let's recall the rules: the feedback is absolute. If we guess a word with A at position 3, and if the secret word has A at a different position (not 3) then we will get a '-' because A exists but in wrong place. And if the secret word does not have A at all? But we know from the first guess that A is present.

 So, to test position 3 again for A? Actually, we know it's not at position 3 from the first feedback? How? The first guess has A at position 3 and the feedback was '-' meaning the A is present but not at position 3. Therefore, regardless of what we do, the secret word does not have A at position 3.

 Therefore, if we guess ""BRAVO"":
   A is again at position 3? Then the feedback for A must be '-' (since we know A isn't at position 3) but that wouldn't tell us anything new. So we don't want to put A in position 3 again.

 Instead, we should try to place A in a new position: either 1, 4, or 5.

 Consider: 
   Position 1: such as ""TRACK"" -> but invalid because of C and we don't use E? But C is excluded so we cannot use it? And ""TRACK"" contains C -> discard.

   How about ""BROAD""? 
      Position 1: B, 2: R, 3: O, 4: A, 5: D.
      This has A at position 4, which is allowed. And letters: B, R, O, A, D -> none of C, N, E.

   Or ""DRAIN""? But N is excluded -> discard.

   Or ""GRAPE""? E is excluded -> discard.

   Or ""TRAIL"": 
      Position 1: T, 2: R, 3: A -> but A cannot be at position 3? Then we know that if we guess TRAIL and A is at 3, it will be marked '-' because we know A is not at 3. So that would waste a slot? We want to test other positions.

   Therefore, let's avoid putting A at position 3. Instead, let me try:

   Option: ""PARTY"": 
      P(1), A(2) -> Wait, position 2 is R? So we cannot put A at position 2 because position 2 is R. 
      Correction: The word must have R at position 2. So ""PARTY"" would be: P(1), A(2)? -> No, that's conflict because position 2 must be R.

   So we can't put A at position 2 because that position is fixed as R.

   Therefore, A can only be at position 1, 4, or 5? Actually, position 1, 4, or 5.

   Example words with R as the second letter and A at position 1: 
      ""ARISE"": But E is excluded -> discard.
      ""AROMA"": M is new? And O at 4? -> A(1), R(2), O(3), M(4), A(5) -> but we have two A's? And also, we don't know about O and M.

   But note: the word might have duplicates? The rules don't forbid duplicates? Actually, in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? However, the example given does not have duplicates. But let's stick to words that haven't been excluded.

   ""BRAVE"": but E is excluded -> discard.

   ""CRATE"": has C and E -> discard.

   ""DRAMA"": D(1), R(2), A(3) -> but we know A cannot be at position 3? So then A(3) would be wrong? Also, duplicate A? 
        We don't know if the word has duplicates. But if we guess ""drama"", then the A at position 3 would be marked '-' (if present elsewhere) and the A at position 5 might be marked appropriately.

   However, a better idea: let's choose a word that avoids reused letters and tests new letters.

   Another word: ""PARTS"": P(1), A(2) -> wait, second letter must be R? So we need: _ R _ _ _
        So we cannot have A at the second letter? Because the second letter is R.

   Correct: the word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

   So we can have A at position1: A R _ _ _ 
        Example: ""ARTIC"" -> has C? Discard.
        ""ARDOR"": has O and R again? Also duplicates? And we don't know about O and D.

   Position4: _ R _ A _
        Example: ""TRUAD""? Not a word. 
        ""GRAND"": but N excluded -> discard.
        ""WROAD""? Not a word.

   Position5: _ R _ _ A
        Example: ""BARCA""? Not a word.
        ""FORMA""? But M and F? And O? 
        ""PRIMA"": P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5) -> this is valid.

   So let's consider ""PRIMA"": 
        Letters: P, R, I, M, A -> all new except R and A (and A we know is present). Also avoids C, E, N.

   However, we are not sure if A is at position5? But this guess tests that.

   If we guess ""PRIMA"":
      If the secret word has A at position5, we might get a check for A? But the feedback will tell.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position1: ""ARTSY"" -> T, S, Y? But R must be at position2? That word: A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4), Y(5). That works. And letters: A,R,T,S,Y -> no C, E, N.

   So compare ""ARTSY"" and ""PRIMA"".

   Both seem valid. Which one gives more information?

   ""ARTSY"" tests: 
      Position1: A -> we know A is present, so if it gets ✓ then good, but if it gets '-' then we know A is at position4 or 5? Actually, if it gets ✓ then A is at 1? Then we solved position1. But if it gets '-' that means A is in the word but not at position1? Then since we know it's not at 3, it must be at 4 or 5.

   Also, ""ARTSY"" tests T at position3, S at position4, Y at position5.

   Similarly, ""PRIMA"" tests P at position1, I at position3, M at position4, A at position5.

   Both words are valid.

   But note: in ""ARTSY"", we are using S and T which are common letters.

   Alternatively, we could use ""TRAWL"": 
        T(1), R(2), A(3), W(4), L(5) -> but A would be at position3? And we know A isn't at position3? So then the A in position3 would be marked as '-'? That would be redundant? Because we already know A isn't at position3. So it would waste one slot? Then we only get new information for T, W, L.

   Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position3.

   So between ""ARTSY"" and ""PRIMA"", I think ""ARTSY"" is better because it uses very common letters: T, S, and Y.

   Also, it avoids repeating a position we know A doesn't go? Because A is at position1? 

   Moreover, if the word does not have A at position1 and we get a feedback of '-' for A, then we know A must be at 4 or 5.

   So I will go with ""ARTSY"".

   But note: we have used the letter R again? We know it's correct at position2, so we don't need to change that.

   So let's guess ""ARTSY"".

   But wait: the feedback for the first guess indicated that A is in the word. If we put A at a new position (position1), what if the secret word has A at position4 or 5? Then we get A at position1 marked as '-', meaning that A is present but not at 1, but we don't know which one? And we also are testing T, S, Y.

   Alternatively, we could try ""PURDA"" or ""WORDY"", but I think ""ARTSY"" is a good choice.

   Another word: ""TARES"", but E is excluded -> discard.

   So I will go with ""ARTSY"".

   Steps:
      Guess 2: ""ARTSY""

   But let me double-check: 
      Position 1: A -> we know A is present, so if it's not at 3, it might be at 1? We are testing.
      Position 2: R -> already known to be correct, so ✓ expected? Actually, in the feedback, we hope to get R(✓) at position2.
      Position 3: T -> unknown
      Position 4: S -> unknown
      Position 5: Y -> unknown

   We avoid C, E, N.

   So let's output ""ARTSY"".

   Alternatively, if we want to test multiple possibilities at once? We know that A must be at 1,4, or 5? What word could test A at 1 and also at 4 and 5? But that is impossible. So we choose a position to test.

   Also, note that the secret word might have two A's? It's possible? But since we haven't encountered any duplicate feedback? We don't know. But we will see.

   I think ""ARTSY"" is a reasonable choice.

<guess>artsy</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is confirmed in the second position (✓).
- A is present in the secret word but not in the third position (-).
- C, N, and E are absent from the word (x).

The secret word adheres to the pattern: _ R _ _ _ (where the second letter is R). The letter A must appear in either position 1, 4, or 5, since it cannot be in positions 2 (occupied by R) or 3 (confirmed by the first feedback). Letters C, N, and E are excluded.

For the next guess, I chose ""artsy"" for the following reasons:
- It keeps R in position 2 (already confirmed).
- It tests A in position 1, which is one of the possible positions for A (if A is in position 1, we'll get ✓; if not, we'll get - and know A must be in position 4 or 5).
- It introduces new common consonants (T in position 3, S in position 4, Y in position 5) to maximize information.
- It avoids excluded letters (C, N, E).

<guess>artsy</guess>",artsy,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)

 This means:
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2). So the second letter of the secret word is R.
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it's present, but not in the first position? Note: our guess had A in position 3 because C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)). Therefore, A is somewhere in the word but not in position 3.
 - C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has:
   Position 2: R
   Contains A, but not at position 3.
   Does not contain C, N, E.

 Therefore, the word is of the form: _ R _ _ _

 Since A is not at position 3 and also not at position 2 (which is R), it must be at position 1, 4, or 5.

 But note: we also know A cannot be at position 1? Why? Because we don't have information about position 1 yet. Actually, it could be at position 1, 4, or 5.

 We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E.

But if it gets '-' that means A is in the word but not at position1? Then since we know it's not at 3, it must be at 4 or 5.

   Also, ""ARTSY"" tests T at position3, S at position4, Y at position5.

   Similarly, ""PRIMA"" tests P at position1, I at position3, M at position4, A at position5.

   Both words are valid.

   But note: in ""ARTSY"", we are using S and T which are common letters.

   Alternatively, we could use ""TRAWL"": 
        T(1), R(2), A(3), W(4), L(5) -> but A would be at position3? And we know A isn't at position3? So then the A in position3 would be marked as '-'? That would be redundant? Because we already know A isn't at position3. So it would waste one slot? Then we only get new information for T, W, L.

   Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position3.

   So between ""ARTSY"" and ""PRIMA"", I think ""ARTSY"" is better because it uses very common letters: T, S, and Y.

   Also, it avoids repeating a position we know A doesn't go? Because A is at position1? 

   Moreover, if the word does not have A at position1 and we get a feedback of '-' for A, then we know A must be at 4 or 5.

   So I will go with ""ARTSY"".

   But note: we have used the letter R again? We know it's correct at position2, so we don't need to change that.

   So let's guess ""ARTSY"".

   But wait: the feedback for the first guess indicated that A is in the word. If we put A at a new position (position1), what if the secret word has A at position4 or 5? Then we get A at position1 marked as '-', meaning that A is present but not at 1, but we don't know which one? And we also are testing T, S, Y.

   Alternatively, we could try ""PURDA"" or ""WORDY"", but I think ""ARTSY"" is a good choice.

   Another word: ""TARES"", but E is excluded -> discard.

   So I will go with ""ARTSY"".

   Steps:
      Guess 2: ""ARTSY""

   But let me double-check: 
      Position 1: A -> we know A is present, so if it's not at 3, it might be at 1? We are testing.
      Position 2: R -> already known to be correct, so ✓ expected? Actually, in the feedback, we hope to get R(✓) at position2.
      Position 3: T -> unknown
      Position 4: S -> unknown
      Position 5: Y -> unknown

   We avoid C, E, N.

   So let's output ""ARTSY"".

   Alternatively, if we want to test multiple possibilities at once? We know that A must be at 1,4, or 5? What word could test A at 1 and also at 4 and 5? But that is impossible. So we choose a position to test.

   Also, note that the secret word might have two A's? It's possible? But since we haven't encountered any duplicate feedback? We don't know. But we will see.

   I think ""ARTSY"" is a reasonable choice.

<guess>artsy</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is confirmed in the second position (✓).
- A is present in the secret word but not in the third position (-).
- C, N, and E are absent from the word (x).

The secret word adheres to the pattern: _ R _ _ _ (where the second letter is R). The letter A must appear in either position 1, 4, or 5, since it cannot be in positions 2 (occupied by R) or 3 (confirmed by the first feedback). Letters C, N, and E are excluded.

For the next guess, I chose ""artsy"" for the following reasons:
- It keeps R in position 2 (already confirmed).
- It tests A in position 1, which is one of the possible positions for A (if A is in position 1, we'll get ✓; if not, we'll get - and know A must be in position 4 or 5).
- It introduces new common consonants (T in position 3, S in position 4, Y in position 5) to maximize information.
- It avoids excluded letters (C, N, E).",Guess 2: artsy -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)

 This means:
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2). So the second letter of the secret word is R.
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it's present, but not in the first position? Note: our guess had A in position 3 because C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)). Therefore, A is somewhere in the word but not in position 3.
 - C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has:
   Position 2: R
   Contains A, but not at position 3.
   Does not contain C, N, E.

 Therefore, the word is of the form: _ R _ _ _

 Since A is not at position 3 and also not at position 2 (which is R), it must be at position 1, 4, or 5.

 But note: we also know A cannot be at position 1? Why? Because we don't have information about position 1 yet. Actually, it could be at position 1, 4, or 5.

 We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We know we cannot use C, N, E again. We must use A again, and we know R is fixed at position 2.

 For our next guess, we want to maximize the information. We should try to test common letters and also try to place A in possible positions.

 Since A is known to be in the word but not at position 3, let's try to put A in a different position to see if it fits.

 Also, we need to avoid the letters C, N, E.

 Possibilities for A: position 1, 4, or 5.

 Let me think of words that have R as the second letter, contain A, and do not contain C, N, E.

 Some common words: 
   We can try ""PARTY"" -> but we are avoiding the letter E? Wait, E is out, but T and Y are new.

 However, note: we have limited knowledge. Another idea: we could try a word that uses other common vowels and consonants.

 But we also know that the word doesn't contain E, so vowels we can use are: A (we know), and others like I, O, U.

 Also, we haven't tried letters like T, S, L, etc.

 Let me think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and include A (somewhere but position 3) and exclude C, N, E.

 Examples:
   BRAVO? -> But we have O, which we haven't tested. Also, we have B and V. And A would be at position 3? Wait, position 3 is the third letter -> BRAVO: B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), O(5). But our feedback said A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback for our guess ""crane"" had A at position 3 and said A(-) meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So putting A at position 3 in a new guess would be inconsistent? Actually, in the new guess we can put it anywhere because we are testing. But note: we know that if we put A at position 3 in a new guess and it turns out to be correct, then we might misinterpret the feedback? Actually, the feedback will tell us if the letter is correct.

 However, let's recall the rules: the feedback is absolute. If we guess a word with A at position 3, and if the secret word has A at a different position (not 3) then we will get a '-' because A exists but in wrong place. And if the secret word does not have A at all? But we know from the first guess that A is present.

 So, to test position 3 again for A? Actually, we know it's not at position 3 from the first feedback? How? The first guess has A at position 3 and the feedback was '-' meaning the A is present but not at position 3. Therefore, regardless of what we do, the secret word does not have A at position 3.

 Therefore, if we guess ""BRAVO"":
   A is again at position 3? Then the feedback for A must be '-' (since we know A isn't at position 3) but that wouldn't tell us anything new. So we don't want to put A in position 3 again.

 Instead, we should try to place A in a new position: either 1, 4, or 5.

 Consider: 
   Position 1: such as ""TRACK"" -> but invalid because of C and we don't use E? But C is excluded so we cannot use it? And ""TRACK"" contains C -> discard.

   How about ""BROAD""? 
      Position 1: B, 2: R, 3: O, 4: A, 5: D.
      This has A at position 4, which is allowed. And letters: B, R, O, A, D -> none of C, N, E.

   Or ""DRAIN""? But N is excluded -> discard.

   Or ""GRAPE""? E is excluded -> discard.

   Or ""TRAIL"": 
      Position 1: T, 2: R, 3: A -> but A cannot be at position 3? Then we know that if we guess TRAIL and A is at 3, it will be marked '-' because we know A is not at 3. So that would waste a slot? We want to test other positions.

   Therefore, let's avoid putting A at position 3. Instead, let me try:

   Option: ""PARTY"": 
      P(1), A(2) -> Wait, position 2 is R? So we cannot put A at position 2 because position 2 is R. 
      Correction: The word must have R at position 2. So ""PARTY"" would be: P(1), A(2)? -> No, that's conflict because position 2 must be R.

   So we can't put A at position 2 because that position is fixed as R.

   Therefore, A can only be at position 1, 4, or 5? Actually, position 1, 4, or 5.

   Example words with R as the second letter and A at position 1: 
      ""ARISE"": But E is excluded -> discard.
      ""AROMA"": M is new? And O at 4? -> A(1), R(2), O(3), M(4), A(5) -> but we have two A's? And also, we don't know about O and M.

   But note: the word might have duplicates? The rules don't forbid duplicates? Actually, in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? However, the example given does not have duplicates. But let's stick to words that haven't been excluded.

   ""BRAVE"": but E is excluded -> discard.

   ""CRATE"": has C and E -> discard.

   ""DRAMA"": D(1), R(2), A(3) -> but we know A cannot be at position 3? So then A(3) would be wrong? Also, duplicate A? 
        We don't know if the word has duplicates. But if we guess ""drama"", then the A at position 3 would be marked '-' (if present elsewhere) and the A at position 5 might be marked appropriately.

   However, a better idea: let's choose a word that avoids reused letters and tests new letters.

   Another word: ""PARTS"": P(1), A(2) -> wait, second letter must be R? So we need: _ R _ _ _
        So we cannot have A at the second letter? Because the second letter is R.

   Correct: the word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

   So we can have A at position1: A R _ _ _ 
        Example: ""ARTIC"" -> has C? Discard.
        ""ARDOR"": has O and R again? Also duplicates? And we don't know about O and D.

   Position4: _ R _ A _
        Example: ""TRUAD""? Not a word. 
        ""GRAND"": but N excluded -> discard.
        ""WROAD""? Not a word.

   Position5: _ R _ _ A
        Example: ""BARCA""? Not a word.
        ""FORMA""? But M and F? And O? 
        ""PRIMA"": P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5) -> this is valid.

   So let's consider ""PRIMA"": 
        Letters: P, R, I, M, A -> all new except R and A (and A we know is present). Also avoids C, E, N.

   However, we are not sure if A is at position5? But this guess tests that.

   If we guess ""PRIMA"":
      If the secret word has A at position5, we might get a check for A? But the feedback will tell.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position1: ""ARTSY"" -> T, S, Y? But R must be at position2? That word: A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4), Y(5). That works. And letters: A,R,T,S,Y -> no C, E, N.

   So compare ""ARTSY"" and ""PRIMA"".

   Both seem valid. Which one gives more information?

   ""ARTSY"" tests: 
      Position1: A -> we know A is present, so if it gets ✓ then good, but if it gets '-' then we know A is at position4 or 5? Actually, if it gets ✓ then A is at 1? Then we solved position1. But if it gets '-' that means A is in the word but not at position1? Then since we know it's not at 3, it must be at 4 or 5.

   Also, ""ARTSY"" tests T at position3, S at position4, Y at position5.

   Similarly, ""PRIMA"" tests P at position1, I at position3, M at position4, A at position5.

   Both words are valid.

   But note: in ""ARTSY"", we are using S and T which are common letters.

   Alternatively, we could use ""TRAWL"": 
        T(1), R(2), A(3), W(4), L(5) -> but A would be at position3? And we know A isn't at position3? So then the A in position3 would be marked as '-'? That would be redundant? Because we already know A isn't at position3. So it would waste one slot? Then we only get new information for T, W, L.

   Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position3.

   So between ""ARTSY"" and ""PRIMA"", I think ""ARTSY"" is better because it uses very common letters: T, S, and Y.

   Also, it avoids repeating a position we know A doesn't go? Because A is at position1? 

   Moreover, if the word does not have A at position1 and we get a feedback of '-' for A, then we know A must be at 4 or 5.

   So I will go with ""ARTSY"".

   But note: we have used the letter R again? We know it's correct at position2, so we don't need to change that.

   So let's guess ""ARTSY"".

   But wait: the feedback for the first guess indicated that A is in the word. If we put A at a new position (position1), what if the secret word has A at position4 or 5? Then we get A at position1 marked as '-', meaning that A is present but not at 1, but we don't know which one? And we also are testing T, S, Y.

   Alternatively, we could try ""PURDA"" or ""WORDY"", but I think ""ARTSY"" is a good choice.

   Another word: ""TARES"", but E is excluded -> discard.

   So I will go with ""ARTSY"".

   Steps:
      Guess 2: ""ARTSY""

   But let me double-check: 
      Position 1: A -> we know A is present, so if it's not at 3, it might be at 1? We are testing.
      Position 2: R -> already known to be correct, so ✓ expected? Actually, in the feedback, we hope to get R(✓) at position2.
      Position 3: T -> unknown
      Position 4: S -> unknown
      Position 5: Y -> unknown

   We avoid C, E, N.

   So let's output ""ARTSY"".

   Alternatively, if we want to test multiple possibilities at once? We know that A must be at 1,4, or 5? What word could test A at 1 and also at 4 and 5? But that is impossible. So we choose a position to test.

Not a word. \n        ""GRAND"": but N excluded -> discard.\n        ""WROAD""? Not a word.\n\n   Position5: _ R _ _ A\n        Example: ""BARCA""? Not a word.\n        ""FORMA""? But M and F? And O? \n        ""PRIMA"": P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5) -> this is valid.\n\n   So let\'s consider ""PRIMA"": \n        Letters: P, R, I, M, A -> all new except R and A (and A we know is present). Also avoids C, E, N.\n\n   However, we are not sure if A is at position5? But this guess tests that.\n\n   If we guess ""PRIMA"":\n      If the secret word has A at position5, we might get a check for A? But the feedback will tell.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position1: ""ARTSY"" -> T, S, Y? But R must be at position2? That word: A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4), Y(5). That works. And letters: A,R,T,S,Y -> no C, E, N.\n\n   So compare ""ARTSY"" and ""PRIMA"".\n\n   Both seem valid. Which one gives more information?\n\n   ""ARTSY"" tests: \n      Position1: A -> we know A is present, so if it gets ✓ then good, but if it gets \'-\' then we know A is at position4 or 5? Actually, if it gets ✓ then A is at 1? Then we solved position1. But if it gets \'-\' that means A is in the word but not at position1? Then since we know it\'s not at 3, it must be at 4 or 5.\n\n   Also, ""ARTSY"" tests T at position3, S at position4, Y at position5.\n\n   Similarly, ""PRIMA"" tests P at position1, I at position3, M at position4, A at position5.\n\n   Both words are valid.\n\n   But note: in ""ARTSY"", we are using S and T which are common letters.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use ""TRAWL"": \n        T(1), R(2), A(3), W(4), L(5) -> but A would be at position3? And we know A isn\'t at position3? So then the A in position3 would be marked as \'-\'? That would be redundant? Because we already know A isn\'t at position3. So it would waste one slot? Then we only get new information for T, W, L.\n\n   Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position3.\n\n   So between ""ARTSY"" and ""PRIMA"", I think ""ARTSY"" is better because it uses very common letters: T, S, and Y.\n\n   Also, it avoids repeating a position we know A doesn\'t go? Because A is at position1? \n\n   Moreover, if the word does not have A at position1 and we get a feedback of \'-\' for A, then we know A must be at 4 or 5.\n\n   So I will go with ""ARTSY"".\n\n   But note: we have used the letter R again? We know it\'s correct at position2, so we don\'t need to change that.\n\n   So let\'s guess ""ARTSY"".\n\n   But wait: the feedback for the first guess indicated that A is in the word. If we put A at a new position (position1), what if the secret word has A at position4 or 5? Then we get A at position1 marked as \'-\', meaning that A is present but not at 1, but we don\'t know which one? And we also are testing T, S, Y.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try ""PURDA"" or ""WORDY"", but I think ""ARTSY"" is a good choice.\n\n   Another word: ""TARES"", but E is excluded -> discard.\n\n   So I will go with ""ARTSY"".\n\n   Steps:\n      Guess 2: ""ARTSY""\n\n   But let me double-check: \n      Position 1: A -> we know A is present, so if it\'s not at 3, it might be at 1? We are testing.\n      Position 2: R -> already known to be correct, so ✓ expected? Actually, in the feedback, we hope to get R(✓) at position2.\n      Position 3: T -> unknown\n      Position 4: S -> unknown\n      Position 5: Y -> unknown\n\n   We avoid C, E, N.\n\n   So let\'s output ""ARTSY"".\n\n   Alternatively, if we want to test multiple possibilities at once? We know that A must be at 1,4, or 5? What word could test A at 1 and also at 4 and 5? But that is impossible. So we choose a position to test.\n\n   Also, note that the secret word might have two A\'s? It\'s possible? But since we haven\'t encountered any duplicate feedback? We don\'t know. But we will see.\n\n   I think ""ARTSY"" is a reasonable choice.\n\n<guess>artsy</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is confirmed in the second position (✓).\n- A is present in the secret word but not in the third position (-).\n- C, N, and E are absent from the word (x).\n\nThe secret word adheres to the pattern: _ R _ _ _ (where the second letter is R). The letter A must appear in either position 1, 4, or 5, since it cannot be in positions 2 (occupied by R) or 3 (confirmed by the first feedback). Letters C, N, and E are excluded.\n\nFor the next guess, I chose ""artsy"" for the following reasons:\n- It keeps R in position 2 (already confirmed).\n- It tests A in position 1, which is one of the possible positions for A (if A is in position 1, we\'ll get ✓; if not, we\'ll get - and know A must be in position 4 or 5).\n- It introduces new common consonants (T in position 3, S in position 4, Y in position 5) to maximize information.\n- It avoids excluded letters (C, N, E).\n\n<guess>artsy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: artsy -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have two sets of feedback:

First guess: crane
Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word and in position 2 (correct).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and got ""-"").
- C, N, E are not in the word.

Second guess: artsy
Feedback: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)
Meaning:
- R is again confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- A is present (we knew that) but NOT in position 1 (since we guessed it in position 1 and got ""-"").
- T, S, Y are not in the word.

Combining information:

- The word has R in position 2.
- The letter A is in the word but not in positions 1, 2 (position 2 is R), or 3. Therefore, A must be in position 4 or 5.

- Excluded letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y (from the feedback x's).
- Letters we know are in the word: A (somewhere) and R (at position 2). Additionally, from the first guess, we also inferred A is present.

So the word pattern is: _ R _ _ _ 
We know the word must contain A in either the 4th or 5th position.

Available letters: We must avoid C, E, N, T, S, Y. So we have other letters to use.

Given that A is in position 4 or 5, we need to choose a word that:
1. Has R at position 2.
2. Contains A in either position 4 or 5 (we need to test which one).
3. Uses letters that are not excluded and can help identify other letters.

Potential letters: We haven't tested many vowels or consonants. Vowels available: O, I, U (since A is already present, but there might be more vowels). Consonants: many available such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Z.

Since A is constrained to positions 4 or 5, I can make two different guesses to test these, but ideally, I'd like to test both possibilities in one guess? That might be hard.

Alternatively, I can choose a word that has A in position 4 and then another word for position 5? But I want to gain more information about other positions.

Idea: guess a word that has A in position 4 and uses new common letters to test other positions.

Example words with A at position 4 and pattern _ R _ A _ :

- ""BROAD"": But O and D? And we haven't excluded O or D. However, let me check the letters: B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5). This uses O and D. But ""broad"" is a valid word.

But let me see if A is at position 5: pattern _ R _ _ A 
- ""FRIDA"": Not a word.
- ""GRAMA"": Valid? Actually, ""gamma"" has two M's but that's different. ""GRAVA""? Not valid.

Another word for _ R _ A _ : 
- ""DROPA""? Not a word.
- ""GROMA""? Not a word.
- ""PROVA""? Not a word.

Common words: 
- ""FORAM""? Not common.

Another idea: ""ARMOR"" but then A is at position1? But we know position1 doesn't have A? And armor: A1, R2, M3, O4, R5. Also duplicate R? And position4 is O? Then A at position1? But feedback said A not at position1? So ""armor"" wouldn't be valid? Moreover, A is only allowed at 4 or 5? So it has to be at 4 or 5? So ""armor"" is invalid because A is at1.

How about ""WROAD""? Not a word.

What about ""BREAD""? But E is excluded? Discard.

""FRAUD"": 
  F(1), R(2), A(3) -> wait, A cannot be at position3? But our guess has A at position3? The pattern: F(1), R(2), A(3), U(4), D(5). But we know A is not at position3? So this is invalid? Because we are putting A in a position we know it cannot be? So if I guess ""FRAUD"", then A at position3 is going to get a '-'? And that's redundant? And it doesn't test A at position4 or5? Because we are guessing A at3.

So avoid any word that has A at position1 (not allowed), position2 (taken by R), position3 (already known not there). Only positions 4 and 5 are allowed.

Therefore, we must choose words with A at either position4 or position5.

Let's try to think of words ending with ""A"" (position5): _ R _ _ A
Examples:
- ""BARCA"": invalid word? 
- ""PARSA"": obscure?
- ""TOROA"": invalid?
- ""VIRGA"": valid? It's a noun meaning a streak of rain, but uncommon.

Common words: Not many common English words end with A? Except words like ""pizza"" (but we've excluded Z and T? S also excluded?).

What about ""URBAN""? But N is excluded? Discard.

Another: ""ORVAN""? Not a word.

Perhaps not many for position5? So maybe position4 is more promising?

Pattern _ R _ A _
Examples:
- ""BROAD"": as above, valid.
- ""CROAK"": C excluded -> discard.
- ""DROOL"": D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5) -> no A? We need to include A? So we need to have A in position4.

Wait, pattern _ R _ A _ must have A at position4? Then the fifth letter can be anything? So:

""FRAMED""? Too long? 5 letters: FRAME -> 5 letters? But E is excluded? And S? Not.

""GRAMA"": a type of grass? Valid word? GRAMA: G R A M A? But then positions: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5)? Wait, that's A at position3 and position5? We are allowed A at position5? But we cannot have A at position3? So in the pattern we are constructing for a guess? If I guess ""grama"", then position3 is A? Then we get '-' for A at3? But we know that already? That wastes one slot? Then we want the A at position5 to test? 

So ""GRAMA"" would be: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5)
Feedback: 
  Position1: G
  Position2: R (✓)
  Position3: A -> known to be not here? So '-' (redundant)
  Position4: M
  Position5: A -> we are testing if it's at position5? But if the secret word has A only once? Then if the secret word has A at position4 or5? We will get double feedback? 

But we don't know if the word has duplicate A's? So I guess we can try? However, ""GRAMA"" has two A's? 

But let's note: our goal is to test if A is at position5? And if it is, then the fifth letter might be A? Also, we get to test G and M.

Alternatively, I can choose a word without duplicate A? 

What for pattern with A at position4: _ R _ A _ 
We have three positions: letter1, letter3, and letter5 to decide? We need a word? 

Examples: 
- ""BROAD"": B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5) -> no duplicate A? And avoids C,E,N,T,S,Y? Valid letters: B, O, D.

Other options?
- ""FROAD""? Not a word.
- ""PROW A""? Not.
- ""GROAN"": but N excluded -> discard.
- ""GROWL"": no A? Needed.

""WROAD""? Not valid.

So ""BROAD"" seems decent? Or ""DROID"": no A? 

What about ""AVAIL"": but A at1? Not allowed? And position2 must be R? So no.

But ""AVAIL"" doesn't fit the pattern? We are stuck? 

Another idea:  _ R _ A _ 
- ""TRAMP"": has T? T is excluded -> discard.
- ""CRAMP"": C excluded? Also T excluded? 

""GRAPE"": E excluded? 

Another: ""BRAWL"": has A at position3? Not allowed? 

OR: ""PROUD"": no A? 

So it's hard? 

How about A at position5: _ R _ _ A with all new letters?

Words:
- ""VERA5"": not valid.
- ""FURIA"": not common? 
- ""DUCAL"": D(1), U(2), ... but position2 must be R? 

Pattern: letter1, R, letter3, letter4, A.

So that pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] A

Examples:
- ""PARMA"": P(1), R(2), M(3), A(4)? Wait: this has A at position4? But I'm aiming for A at position5? Here position5 is undefined? 

Wait, no: for position5? Then the word must be [ ] R [ ] [ ] A
Then the last letter is A? So:

- ""URBIA"": U(1), R(2), B(3), I(4), A(5) -> valid? But not common? 
- ""ORBIA""? Not a word.

Common words: 
- ""MEDIA"": but E and M? And position2 must be R? So not.

Another: ""India"": I(1), N(2) -> N excluded? And position2 isn't R? 

""AROBA"": A(1) -> but A cannot be at1? So reject? 

Perhaps ""RABAT""? But R at1? 

So a word for _ R _ _ A:
- ""BRADA"" not valid?
- ""CREDA"" not valid?

""GRUDA""? No.

Perhaps I need to consider words that use fewer vowels? Or accept that ""BROAD"" is a valid choice for A at4? 

But ""broad"" uses O and D? We haven't tested O and D? 

Another common word: ""FORAM"" is not common? ""Framed"": 6 letters? 

Perhaps try for a word that tests multiple things? Like ""BRAVA"": B R A V A? Then position3 is A? We know A is not at position3? So that's bad? 

After reconsideration, I think ""BROAD"" is an acceptable choice? Because:
- It has R at2? ✓
- A at position4: we are testing A at a new position? If it's correct? Then position4 is A? If not? Then A must be at5?
- Letters: B, O, D? All new? 

And it avoids the excluded letters? So let me go with that? 

If I guess ""broad"", then the feedback on A at4: if it's '-'? Then A is in the word but not at4? Since we know A is present? Then it must be at position5? Because if it were at any other position? We have excluded positions 1,2,3? So position5 is the only other possibility? 

Similarly, if A gets ✓ at4, then we solved position4? 

So that's good information? 

In fact, if we guess ""broad"", we will definitively place A?

So let me choose ""broad"".

But what about the other positions? We can also test B at1? O at3? D at5? 

So it's a good word? 

Yes.

Therefore, guess: ""broad""

So: <guess>broad</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from both guesses:  
- **Crane feedback**: Eliminates C, N, E; confirms R in position 2 (✓); and shows A exists but not in position 3 (-).  
- **Artsy feedback**: Confirms R again in position 2 (✓); eliminates T, S, Y; and shows A is not in position 1 (-).  

### Deductions:
1. **Pattern**: The word is `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed in position 2).  
2. **A position**: Since A must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1–3 (already tested), it **must** be in position 4 or 5.  
3. **Excluded letters**: C, E, N, T, S, Y cannot appear anywhere.  
4. **Available letters**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W).  

### Optimal Guess: BROAD
- **Why?**  
  - Tests A in **position 4** (since it can't be in 1–3, testing position 4 helps resolve ambiguity—if feedback is ✓, position 4 is solved; if -, A must be in position 5).  
  - Uses new common letters: B (position 1), O (position 3), D (position 5) to maximize information.  
  - Avoids excluded letters and efficiently narrows possibilities.  

<guess>broad</guess>",broad,"We have two sets of feedback:

First guess: crane
Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word and in position 2 (correct).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and got ""-"").
- C, N, E are not in the word.

Second guess: artsy
Feedback: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)
Meaning:
- R is again confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- A is present (we knew that) but NOT in position 1 (since we guessed it in position 1 and got ""-"").
- T, S, Y are not in the word.

Combining information:

- The word has R in position 2.
- The letter A is in the word but not in positions 1, 2 (position 2 is R), or 3. Therefore, A must be in position 4 or 5.

- Excluded letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y (from the feedback x's).

So avoid any word that has A at position1 (not allowed), position2 (taken by R), position3 (already known not there). Only positions 4 and 5 are allowed.

So: <guess>broad</guess>Based on the feedback from both guesses:  
- **Crane feedback**: Eliminates C, N, E; confirms R in position 2 (✓); and shows A exists but not in position 3 (-).  
- **Artsy feedback**: Confirms R again in position 2 (✓); eliminates T, S, Y; and shows A is not in position 1 (-).  

### Deductions:
1. **Pattern**: The word is `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed in position 2).  
2. **A position**: Since A must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1–3 (already tested), it **must** be in position 4 or 5.  
3. **Excluded letters**: C, E, N, T, S, Y cannot appear anywhere.  
4. **Available letters**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W).  

### Optimal Guess: BROAD
- **Why?**  
  - Tests A in **position 4** (since it can't be in 1–3, testing position 4 helps resolve ambiguity—if feedback is ✓, position 4 is solved; if -, A must be in position 5).  
  - Uses new common letters: B (position 1), O (position 3), D (position 5) to maximize information.  
  - Avoids excluded letters and efficiently narrows possibilities.",Guess 3: broad -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(x) A(✓) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,friar,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)

 This means:
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2). So the second letter of the secret word is R.
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it's present, but not in the first position? Note: our guess had A in position 3 because C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)). Therefore, A is somewhere in the word but not in position 3.
 - C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has:
   Position 2: R
   Contains A, but not at position 3.
   Does not contain C, N, E.

 Therefore, the word is of the form: _ R _ _ _

 Since A is not at position 3 and also not at position 2 (which is R), it must be at position 1, 4, or 5.

 But note: we also know A cannot be at position 1? Why? Because we don't have information about position 1 yet. Actually, it could be at position 1, 4, or 5.

 We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We know we cannot use C, N, E again. We must use A again, and we know R is fixed at position 2.

 For our next guess, we want to maximize the information. We should try to test common letters and also try to place A in possible positions.

 Since A is known to be in the word but not at position 3, let's try to put A in a different position to see if it fits.

 Also, we need to avoid the letters C, N, E.

 Possibilities for A: position 1, 4, or 5.

 Let me think of words that have R as the second letter, contain A, and do not contain C, N, E.

 Some common words: 
   We can try ""PARTY"" -> but we are avoiding the letter E? Wait, E is out, but T and Y are new.

 However, note: we have limited knowledge. Another idea: we could try a word that uses other common vowels and consonants.

 But we also know that the word doesn't contain E, so vowels we can use are: A (we know), and others like I, O, U.

 Also, we haven't tried letters like T, S, L, etc.

 Let me think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and include A (somewhere but position 3) and exclude C, N, E.

 Examples:
   BRAVO? -> But we have O, which we haven't tested. Also, we have B and V. And A would be at position 3? Wait, position 3 is the third letter -> BRAVO: B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), O(5). But our feedback said A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback for our guess ""crane"" had A at position 3 and said A(-) meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So putting A at position 3 in a new guess would be inconsistent? Actually, in the new guess we can put it anywhere because we are testing. But note: we know that if we put A at position 3 in a new guess and it turns out to be correct, then we might misinterpret the feedback? Actually, the feedback will tell us if the letter is correct.

 However, let's recall the rules: the feedback is absolute. If we guess a word with A at position 3, and if the secret word has A at a different position (not 3) then we will get a '-' because A exists but in wrong place. And if the secret word does not have A at all? But we know from the first guess that A is present.

 So, to test position 3 again for A? Actually, we know it's not at position 3 from the first feedback? How? The first guess has A at position 3 and the feedback was '-' meaning the A is present but not at position 3. Therefore, regardless of what we do, the secret word does not have A at position 3.

 Therefore, if we guess ""BRAVO"":
   A is again at position 3? Then the feedback for A must be '-' (since we know A isn't at position 3) but that wouldn't tell us anything new. So we don't want to put A in position 3 again.

 Instead, we should try to place A in a new position: either 1, 4, or 5.

 Consider: 
   Position 1: such as ""TRACK"" -> but invalid because of C and we don't use E? But C is excluded so we cannot use it? And ""TRACK"" contains C -> discard.

   How about ""BROAD""? 
      Position 1: B, 2: R, 3: O, 4: A, 5: D.
      This has A at position 4, which is allowed. And letters: B, R, O, A, D -> none of C, N, E.

   Or ""DRAIN""? But N is excluded -> discard.

   Or ""GRAPE""? E is excluded -> discard.

   Or ""TRAIL"": 
      Position 1: T, 2: R, 3: A -> but A cannot be at position 3? Then we know that if we guess TRAIL and A is at 3, it will be marked '-' because we know A is not at 3. So that would waste a slot? We want to test other positions.

   Therefore, let's avoid putting A at position 3. Instead, let me try:

   Option: ""PARTY"": 
      P(1), A(2) -> Wait, position 2 is R? So we cannot put A at position 2 because position 2 is R. 
      Correction: The word must have R at position 2. So ""PARTY"" would be: P(1), A(2)? -> No, that's conflict because position 2 must be R.

   So we can't put A at position 2 because that position is fixed as R.

   Therefore, A can only be at position 1, 4, or 5? Actually, position 1, 4, or 5.

   Example words with R as the second letter and A at position 1: 
      ""ARISE"": But E is excluded -> discard.
      ""AROMA"": M is new? And O at 4? -> A(1), R(2), O(3), M(4), A(5) -> but we have two A's? And also, we don't know about O and M.

   But note: the word might have duplicates? The rules don't forbid duplicates? Actually, in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? However, the example given does not have duplicates. But let's stick to words that haven't been excluded.

   ""BRAVE"": but E is excluded -> discard.

   ""CRATE"": has C and E -> discard.

   ""DRAMA"": D(1), R(2), A(3) -> but we know A cannot be at position 3? So then A(3) would be wrong? Also, duplicate A? 
        We don't know if the word has duplicates. But if we guess ""drama"", then the A at position 3 would be marked '-' (if present elsewhere) and the A at position 5 might be marked appropriately.

   However, a better idea: let's choose a word that avoids reused letters and tests new letters.

   Another word: ""PARTS"": P(1), A(2) -> wait, second letter must be R? So we need: _ R _ _ _
        So we cannot have A at the second letter? Because the second letter is R.

   Correct: the word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

   So we can have A at position1: A R _ _ _ 
        Example: ""ARTIC"" -> has C? Discard.
        ""ARDOR"": has O and R again? Also duplicates? And we don't know about O and D.

   Position4: _ R _ A _
        Example: ""TRUAD""? Not a word. 
        ""GRAND"": but N excluded -> discard.
        ""WROAD""? Not a word.

   Position5: _ R _ _ A
        Example: ""BARCA""? Not a word.
        ""FORMA""? But M and F? And O? 
        ""PRIMA"": P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5) -> this is valid.

   So let's consider ""PRIMA"": 
        Letters: P, R, I, M, A -> all new except R and A (and A we know is present). Also avoids C, E, N.

   However, we are not sure if A is at position5? But this guess tests that.

   If we guess ""PRIMA"":
      If the secret word has A at position5, we might get a check for A? But the feedback will tell.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position1: ""ARTSY"" -> T, S, Y? But R must be at position2? That word: A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4), Y(5). That works. And letters: A,R,T,S,Y -> no C, E, N.

   So compare ""ARTSY"" and ""PRIMA"".

   Both seem valid. Which one gives more information?

   ""ARTSY"" tests: 
      Position1: A -> we know A is present, so if it gets ✓ then good, but if it gets '-' then we know A is at position4 or 5? Actually, if it gets ✓ then A is at 1? Then we solved position1. But if it gets '-' that means A is in the word but not at position1? Then since we know it's not at 3, it must be at 4 or 5.

   Also, ""ARTSY"" tests T at position3, S at position4, Y at position5.

   Similarly, ""PRIMA"" tests P at position1, I at position3, M at position4, A at position5.

   Both words are valid.

   But note: in ""ARTSY"", we are using S and T which are common letters.

   Alternatively, we could use ""TRAWL"": 
        T(1), R(2), A(3), W(4), L(5) -> but A would be at position3? And we know A isn't at position3? So then the A in position3 would be marked as '-'? That would be redundant? Because we already know A isn't at position3. So it would waste one slot? Then we only get new information for T, W, L.

   Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position3.

   So between ""ARTSY"" and ""PRIMA"", I think ""ARTSY"" is better because it uses very common letters: T, S, and Y.

   Also, it avoids repeating a position we know A doesn't go? Because A is at position1? 

   Moreover, if the word does not have A at position1 and we get a feedback of '-' for A, then we know A must be at 4 or 5.

   So I will go with ""ARTSY"".

   But note: we have used the letter R again? We know it's correct at position2, so we don't need to change that.

   So let's guess ""ARTSY"".

   But wait: the feedback for the first guess indicated that A is in the word. If we put A at a new position (position1), what if the secret word has A at position4 or 5? Then we get A at position1 marked as '-', meaning that A is present but not at 1, but we don't know which one? And we also are testing T, S, Y.

   Alternatively, we could try ""PURDA"" or ""WORDY"", but I think ""ARTSY"" is a good choice.

   Another word: ""TARES"", but E is excluded -> discard.

   So I will go with ""ARTSY"".

   Steps:
      Guess 2: ""ARTSY""

   But let me double-check: 
      Position 1: A -> we know A is present, so if it's not at 3, it might be at 1? We are testing.
      Position 2: R -> already known to be correct, so ✓ expected? Actually, in the feedback, we hope to get R(✓) at position2.
      Position 3: T -> unknown
      Position 4: S -> unknown
      Position 5: Y -> unknown

   We avoid C, E, N.

   So let's output ""ARTSY"".

   Alternatively, if we want to test multiple possibilities at once? We know that A must be at 1,4, or 5? What word could test A at 1 and also at 4 and 5? But that is impossible. So we choose a position to test.

   Also, note that the secret word might have two A's? It's possible? But since we haven't encountered any duplicate feedback? We don't know. But we will see.

   I think ""ARTSY"" is a reasonable choice.

<guess>artsy</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is confirmed in the second position (✓).
- A is present in the secret word but not in the third position (-).
- C, N, and E are absent from the word (x).

The secret word adheres to the pattern: _ R _ _ _ (where the second letter is R). The letter A must appear in either position 1, 4, or 5, since it cannot be in positions 2 (occupied by R) or 3 (confirmed by the first feedback). Letters C, N, and E are excluded.

For the next guess, I chose ""artsy"" for the following reasons:
- It keeps R in position 2 (already confirmed).
- It tests A in position 1, which is one of the possible positions for A (if A is in position 1, we'll get ✓; if not, we'll get - and know A must be in position 4 or 5).
- It introduces new common consonants (T in position 3, S in position 4, Y in position 5) to maximize information.
- It avoids excluded letters (C, N, E).

<guess>artsy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: artsy -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

First guess: crane
Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word and in position 2 (correct).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and got ""-"").
- C, N, E are not in the word.

Second guess: artsy
Feedback: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)
Meaning:
- R is again confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- A is present (we knew that) but NOT in position 1 (since we guessed it in position 1 and got ""-"").
- T, S, Y are not in the word.

Combining information:

- The word has R in position 2.
- The letter A is in the word but not in positions 1, 2 (position 2 is R), or 3. Therefore, A must be in position 4 or 5.

- Excluded letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y (from the feedback x's).
- Letters we know are in the word: A (somewhere) and R (at position 2). Additionally, from the first guess, we also inferred A is present.

So the word pattern is: _ R _ _ _ 
We know the word must contain A in either the 4th or 5th position.

Available letters: We must avoid C, E, N, T, S, Y. So we have other letters to use.

Given that A is in position 4 or 5, we need to choose a word that:
1. Has R at position 2.
2. Contains A in either position 4 or 5 (we need to test which one).
3. Uses letters that are not excluded and can help identify other letters.

Potential letters: We haven't tested many vowels or consonants. Vowels available: O, I, U (since A is already present, but there might be more vowels). Consonants: many available such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Z.

Since A is constrained to positions 4 or 5, I can make two different guesses to test these, but ideally, I'd like to test both possibilities in one guess? That might be hard.

Alternatively, I can choose a word that has A in position 4 and then another word for position 5? But I want to gain more information about other positions.

Idea: guess a word that has A in position 4 and uses new common letters to test other positions.

Example words with A at position 4 and pattern _ R _ A _ :

- ""BROAD"": But O and D? And we haven't excluded O or D. However, let me check the letters: B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5). This uses O and D. But ""broad"" is a valid word.

But let me see if A is at position 5: pattern _ R _ _ A 
- ""FRIDA"": Not a word.
- ""GRAMA"": Valid? Actually, ""gamma"" has two M's but that's different. ""GRAVA""? Not valid.

Another word for _ R _ A _ : 
- ""DROPA""? Not a word.
- ""GROMA""? Not a word.
- ""PROVA""? Not a word.

Common words: 
- ""FORAM""? Not common.

Another idea: ""ARMOR"" but then A is at position1? But we know position1 doesn't have A? And armor: A1, R2, M3, O4, R5. Also duplicate R? And position4 is O? Then A at position1? But feedback said A not at position1? So ""armor"" wouldn't be valid? Moreover, A is only allowed at 4 or 5? So it has to be at 4 or 5? So ""armor"" is invalid because A is at1.

How about ""WROAD""? Not a word.

What about ""BREAD""? But E is excluded? Discard.

""FRAUD"": 
  F(1), R(2), A(3) -> wait, A cannot be at position3? But our guess has A at position3? The pattern: F(1), R(2), A(3), U(4), D(5). But we know A is not at position3? So this is invalid? Because we are putting A in a position we know it cannot be? So if I guess ""FRAUD"", then A at position3 is going to get a '-'? And that's redundant? And it doesn't test A at position4 or5? Because we are guessing A at3.

So avoid any word that has A at position1 (not allowed), position2 (taken by R), position3 (already known not there). Only positions 4 and 5 are allowed.

Therefore, we must choose words with A at either position4 or position5.

Let's try to think of words ending with ""A"" (position5): _ R _ _ A
Examples:
- ""BARCA"": invalid word? 
- ""PARSA"": obscure?
- ""TOROA"": invalid?
- ""VIRGA"": valid? It's a noun meaning a streak of rain, but uncommon.

Common words: Not many common English words end with A? Except words like ""pizza"" (but we've excluded Z and T? S also excluded?).

What about ""URBAN""? But N is excluded? Discard.

Another: ""ORVAN""? Not a word.

Perhaps not many for position5? So maybe position4 is more promising?

Pattern _ R _ A _
Examples:
- ""BROAD"": as above, valid.
- ""CROAK"": C excluded -> discard.
- ""DROOL"": D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5) -> no A? We need to include A? So we need to have A in position4.

Wait, pattern _ R _ A _ must have A at position4? Then the fifth letter can be anything? So:

""FRAMED""? Too long? 5 letters: FRAME -> 5 letters? But E is excluded? And S? Not.

""GRAMA"": a type of grass? Valid word? GRAMA: G R A M A? But then positions: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5)? Wait, that's A at position3 and position5? We are allowed A at position5? But we cannot have A at position3? So in the pattern we are constructing for a guess? If I guess ""grama"", then position3 is A? Then we get '-' for A at3? But we know that already? That wastes one slot? Then we want the A at position5 to test? 

So ""GRAMA"" would be: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5)
Feedback: 
  Position1: G
  Position2: R (✓)
  Position3: A -> known to be not here? So '-' (redundant)
  Position4: M
  Position5: A -> we are testing if it's at position5? But if the secret word has A only once? Then if the secret word has A at position4 or5? We will get double feedback? 

But we don't know if the word has duplicate A's? So I guess we can try? However, ""GRAMA"" has two A's? 

But let's note: our goal is to test if A is at position5? And if it is, then the fifth letter might be A? Also, we get to test G and M.

Alternatively, I can choose a word without duplicate A? 

What for pattern with A at position4: _ R _ A _ 
We have three positions: letter1, letter3, and letter5 to decide? We need a word? 

Examples: 
- ""BROAD"": B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5) -> no duplicate A? And avoids C,E,N,T,S,Y? Valid letters: B, O, D.

Other options?
- ""FROAD""? Not a word.
- ""PROW A""? Not.
- ""GROAN"": but N excluded -> discard.
- ""GROWL"": no A? Needed.

""WROAD""? Not valid.

So ""BROAD"" seems decent? Or ""DROID"": no A? 

What about ""AVAIL"": but A at1? Not allowed? And position2 must be R? So no.

But ""AVAIL"" doesn't fit the pattern? We are stuck? 

Another idea:  _ R _ A _ 
- ""TRAMP"": has T? T is excluded -> discard.
- ""CRAMP"": C excluded? Also T excluded? 

""GRAPE"": E excluded? 

Another: ""BRAWL"": has A at position3? Not allowed? 

OR: ""PROUD"": no A? 

So it's hard? 

How about A at position5: _ R _ _ A with all new letters?

Words:
- ""VERA5"": not valid.
- ""FURIA"": not common? 
- ""DUCAL"": D(1), U(2), ... but position2 must be R? 

Pattern: letter1, R, letter3, letter4, A.

So that pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] A

Examples:
- ""PARMA"": P(1), R(2), M(3), A(4)? Wait: this has A at position4? But I'm aiming for A at position5? Here position5 is undefined? 

Wait, no: for position5? Then the word must be [ ] R [ ] [ ] A
Then the last letter is A? So:

- ""URBIA"": U(1), R(2), B(3), I(4), A(5) -> valid? But not common? 
- ""ORBIA""? Not a word.

Common words: 
- ""MEDIA"": but E and M? And position2 must be R? So not.

Another: ""India"": I(1), N(2) -> N excluded? And position2 isn't R? 

""AROBA"": A(1) -> but A cannot be at1? So reject? 

Perhaps ""RABAT""? But R at1? 

So a word for _ R _ _ A:
- ""BRADA"" not valid?
- ""CREDA"" not valid?

""GRUDA""? No.

Perhaps I need to consider words that use fewer vowels? Or accept that ""BROAD"" is a valid choice for A at4? 

But ""broad"" uses O and D? We haven't tested O and D? 

Another common word: ""FORAM"" is not common? ""Framed"": 6 letters? 

Perhaps try for a word that tests multiple things? Like ""BRAVA"": B R A V A? Then position3 is A? We know A is not at position3? So that's bad? 

After reconsideration, I think ""BROAD"" is an acceptable choice? Because:
- It has R at2? ✓
- A at position4: we are testing A at a new position? If it's correct? Then position4 is A? If not? Then A must be at5?
- Letters: B, O, D? All new? 

And it avoids the excluded letters? So let me go with that? 

If I guess ""broad"", then the feedback on A at4: if it's '-'? Then A is in the word but not at4? Since we know A is present? Then it must be at position5? Because if it were at any other position? We have excluded positions 1,2,3? So position5 is the only other possibility? 

Similarly, if A gets ✓ at4, then we solved position4? 

So that's good information? 

In fact, if we guess ""broad"", we will definitively place A?

So let me choose ""broad"".

But what about the other positions? We can also test B at1? O at3? D at5? 

So it's a good word? 

Yes.

Therefore, guess: ""broad""

So: <guess>broad</guess>Based on the feedback from both guesses:  
- **Crane feedback**: Eliminates C, N, E; confirms R in position 2 (✓); and shows A exists but not in position 3 (-).  
- **Artsy feedback**: Confirms R again in position 2 (✓); eliminates T, S, Y; and shows A is not in position 1 (-).  

### Deductions:
1. **Pattern**: The word is `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed in position 2).  
2. **A position**: Since A must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1–3 (already tested), it **must** be in position 4 or 5.  
3. **Excluded letters**: C, E, N, T, S, Y cannot appear anywhere.  
4. **Available letters**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W).  

### Optimal Guess: BROAD
- **Why?**  
  - Tests A in **position 4** (since it can't be in 1–3, testing position 4 helps resolve ambiguity—if feedback is ✓, position 4 is solved; if -, A must be in position 5).  
  - Uses new common letters: B (position 1), O (position 3), D (position 5) to maximize information.  
  - Avoids excluded letters and efficiently narrows possibilities.

So the second letter of the secret word is R.\n - A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it\'s present, but not in the first position? Note: our guess had A in position 3 because C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)). Therefore, A is somewhere in the word but not in position 3.\n - C, N, and E are not in the word at all.\n\n So the secret word has:\n   Position 2: R\n   Contains A, but not at position 3.\n   Does not contain C, N, E.\n\n Therefore, the word is of the form: _ R _ _ _\n\n Since A is not at position 3 and also not at position 2 (which is R), it must be at position 1, 4, or 5.\n\n But note: we also know A cannot be at position 1? Why? Because we don\'t have information about position 1 yet. Actually, it could be at position 1, 4, or 5.\n\n We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n We know we cannot use C, N, E again. We must use A again, and we know R is fixed at position 2.\n\n For our next guess, we want to maximize the information. We should try to test common letters and also try to place A in possible positions.\n\n Since A is known to be in the word but not at position 3, let\'s try to put A in a different position to see if it fits.\n\n Also, we need to avoid the letters C, N, E.\n\n Possibilities for A: position 1, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me think of words that have R as the second letter, contain A, and do not contain C, N, E.\n\n Some common words: \n   We can try ""PARTY"" -> but we are avoiding the letter E? Wait, E is out, but T and Y are new.\n\n However, note: we have limited knowledge. Another idea: we could try a word that uses other common vowels and consonants.\n\n But we also know that the word doesn\'t contain E, so vowels we can use are: A (we know), and others like I, O, U.\n\n Also, we haven\'t tried letters like T, S, L, etc.\n\n Let me think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and include A (somewhere but position 3) and exclude C, N, E.\n\n Examples:\n   BRAVO? -> But we have O, which we haven\'t tested. Also, we have B and V. And A would be at position 3? Wait, position 3 is the third letter -> BRAVO: B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), O(5). But our feedback said A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback for our guess ""crane"" had A at position 3 and said A(-) meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So putting A at position 3 in a new guess would be inconsistent? Actually, in the new guess we can put it anywhere because we are testing. But note: we know that if we put A at position 3 in a new guess and it turns out to be correct, then we might misinterpret the feedback? Actually, the feedback will tell us if the letter is correct.\n\n However, let\'s recall the rules: the feedback is absolute. If we guess a word with A at position 3, and if the secret word has A at a different position (not 3) then we will get a \'-\' because A exists but in wrong place. And if the secret word does not have A at all? But we know from the first guess that A is present.\n\n So, to test position 3 again for A? Actually, we know it\'s not at position 3 from the first feedback? How? The first guess has A at position 3 and the feedback was \'-\' meaning the A is present but not at position 3. Therefore, regardless of what we do, the secret word does not have A at position 3.\n\n Therefore, if we guess ""BRAVO"":\n   A is again at position 3? Then the feedback for A must be \'-\' (since we know A isn\'t at position 3) but that wouldn\'t tell us anything new. So we don\'t want to put A in position 3 again.\n\n Instead, we should try to place A in a new position: either 1, 4, or 5.\n\n Consider: \n   Position 1: such as ""TRACK"" -> but invalid because of C and we don\'t use E? But C is excluded so we cannot use it? And ""TRACK"" contains C -> discard.\n\n   How about ""BROAD""? \n      Position 1: B, 2: R, 3: O, 4: A, 5: D.\n      This has A at position 4, which is allowed. And letters: B, R, O, A, D -> none of C, N, E.\n\n   Or ""DRAIN""? But N is excluded -> discard.\n\n   Or ""GRAPE""? E is excluded -> discard.\n\n   Or ""TRAIL"": \n      Position 1: T, 2: R, 3: A -> but A cannot be at position 3? Then we know that if we guess TRAIL and A is at 3, it will be marked \'-\' because we know A is not at 3. So that would waste a slot? We want to test other positions.\n\n   Therefore, let\'s avoid putting A at position 3. Instead, let me try:\n\n   Option: ""PARTY"": \n      P(1), A(2) -> Wait, position 2 is R? So we cannot put A at position 2 because position 2 is R. \n      Correction: The word must have R at position 2. So ""PARTY"" would be: P(1), A(2)? -> No, that\'s conflict because position 2 must be R.\n\n   So we can\'t put A at position 2 because that position is fixed as R.\n\n   Therefore, A can only be at position 1, 4, or 5? Actually, position 1, 4, or 5.\n\n   Example words with R as the second letter and A at position 1: \n      ""ARISE"": But E is excluded -> discard.\n      ""AROMA"": M is new? And O at 4? -> A(1), R(2), O(3), M(4), A(5) -> but we have two A\'s? And also, we don\'t know about O and M.\n\n   But note: the word might have duplicates? The rules don\'t forbid duplicates? Actually, in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? However, the example given does not have duplicates. But let\'s stick to words that haven\'t been excluded.\n\n   ""BRAVE"": but E is excluded -> discard.\n\n   ""CRATE"": has C and E -> discard.\n\n   ""DRAMA"": D(1), R(2), A(3) -> but we know A cannot be at position 3? So then A(3) would be wrong? Also, duplicate A? \n        We don\'t know if the word has duplicates. But if we guess ""drama"", then the A at position 3 would be marked \'-\' (if present elsewhere) and the A at position 5 might be marked appropriately.\n\n   However, a better idea: let\'s choose a word that avoids reused letters and tests new letters.\n\n   Another word: ""PARTS"": P(1), A(2) -> wait, second letter must be R? So we need: _ R _ _ _\n        So we cannot have A at the second letter? Because the second letter is R.\n\n   Correct: the word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n\n   So we can have A at position1: A R _ _ _ \n        Example: ""ARTIC"" -> has C? Discard.\n        ""ARDOR"": has O and R again? Also duplicates? And we don\'t know about O and D.\n\n   Position4: _ R _ A _\n        Example: ""TRUAD""? Not a word. \n        ""GRAND"": but N excluded -> discard.\n        ""WROAD""? Not a word.\n\n   Position5: _ R _ _ A\n        Example: ""BARCA""? Not a word.\n        ""FORMA""? But M and F? And O? \n        ""PRIMA"": P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5) -> this is valid.\n\n   So let\'s consider ""PRIMA"": \n        Letters: P, R, I, M, A -> all new except R and A (and A we know is present). Also avoids C, E, N.\n\n   However, we are not sure if A is at position5? But this guess tests that.\n\n   If we guess ""PRIMA"":\n      If the secret word has A at position5, we might get a check for A? But the feedback will tell.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position1: ""ARTSY"" -> T, S, Y? But R must be at position2? That word: A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4), Y(5). That works. And letters: A,R,T,S,Y -> no C, E, N.\n\n   So compare ""ARTSY"" and ""PRIMA"".\n\n   Both seem valid. Which one gives more information?\n\n   ""ARTSY"" tests: \n      Position1: A -> we know A is present, so if it gets ✓ then good, but if it gets \'-\' then we know A is at position4 or 5? Actually, if it gets ✓ then A is at 1? Then we solved position1. But if it gets \'-\' that means A is in the word but not at position1? Then since we know it\'s not at 3, it must be at 4 or 5.\n\n   Also, ""ARTSY"" tests T at position3, S at position4, Y at position5.\n\n   Similarly, ""PRIMA"" tests P at position1, I at position3, M at position4, A at position5.\n\n   Both words are valid.\n\n   But note: in ""ARTSY"", we are using S and T which are common letters.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use ""TRAWL"": \n        T(1), R(2), A(3), W(4), L(5) -> but A would be at position3? And we know A isn\'t at position3? So then the A in position3 would be marked as \'-\'? That would be redundant? Because we already know A isn\'t at position3. So it would waste one slot? Then we only get new information for T, W, L.\n\n   Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position3.\n\n   So between ""ARTSY"" and ""PRIMA"", I think ""ARTSY"" is better because it uses very common letters: T, S, and Y.\n\n   Also, it avoids repeating a position we know A doesn\'t go? Because A is at position1? \n\n   Moreover, if the word does not have A at position1 and we get a feedback of \'-\' for A, then we know A must be at 4 or 5.\n\n   So I will go with ""ARTSY"".\n\n   But note: we have used the letter R again? We know it\'s correct at position2, so we don\'t need to change that.\n\n   So let\'s guess ""ARTSY"".\n\n   But wait: the feedback for the first guess indicated that A is in the word. If we put A at a new position (position1), what if the secret word has A at position4 or 5? Then we get A at position1 marked as \'-\', meaning that A is present but not at 1, but we don\'t know which one? And we also are testing T, S, Y.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try ""PURDA"" or ""WORDY"", but I think ""ARTSY"" is a good choice.\n\n   Another word: ""TARES"", but E is excluded -> discard.\n\n   So I will go with ""ARTSY"".\n\n   Steps:\n      Guess 2: ""ARTSY""\n\n   But let me double-check: \n      Position 1: A -> we know A is present, so if it\'s not at 3, it might be at 1? We are testing.\n      Position 2: R -> already known to be correct, so ✓ expected? Actually, in the feedback, we hope to get R(✓) at position2.\n      Position 3: T -> unknown\n      Position 4: S -> unknown\n      Position 5: Y -> unknown\n\n   We avoid C, E, N.\n\n   So let\'s output ""ARTSY"".\n\n   Alternatively, if we want to test multiple possibilities at once? We know that A must be at 1,4, or 5? What word could test A at 1 and also at 4 and 5? But that is impossible. So we choose a position to test.\n\n   Also, note that the secret word might have two A\'s? It\'s possible? But since we haven\'t encountered any duplicate feedback? We don\'t know. But we will see.\n\n   I think ""ARTSY"" is a reasonable choice.\n\n<guess>artsy</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is confirmed in the second position (✓).\n- A is present in the secret word but not in the third position (-).\n- C, N, and E are absent from the word (x).\n\nThe secret word adheres to the pattern: _ R _ _ _ (where the second letter is R). The letter A must appear in either position 1, 4, or 5, since it cannot be in positions 2 (occupied by R) or 3 (confirmed by the first feedback). Letters C, N, and E are excluded.\n\nFor the next guess, I chose ""artsy"" for the following reasons:\n- It keeps R in position 2 (already confirmed).\n- It tests A in position 1, which is one of the possible positions for A (if A is in position 1, we\'ll get ✓; if not, we\'ll get - and know A must be in position 4 or 5).\n- It introduces new common consonants (T in position 3, S in position 4, Y in position 5) to maximize information.\n- It avoids excluded letters (C, N, E).\n\n<guess>artsy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: artsy -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nFirst guess: crane\nFeedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the word and in position 2 (correct).\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and got ""-"").\n- C, N, E are not in the word.\n\nSecond guess: artsy\nFeedback: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is again confirmed in position 2 (✓).\n- A is present (we knew that) but NOT in position 1 (since we guessed it in position 1 and got ""-"").\n- T, S, Y are not in the word.\n\nCombining information:\n\n- The word has R in position 2.\n- The letter A is in the word but not in positions 1, 2 (position 2 is R), or 3. Therefore, A must be in position 4 or 5.\n\n- Excluded letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y (from the feedback x\'s).\n- Letters we know are in the word: A (somewhere) and R (at position 2). Additionally, from the first guess, we also inferred A is present.\n\nSo the word pattern is: _ R _ _ _ \nWe know the word must contain A in either the 4th or 5th position.\n\nAvailable letters: We must avoid C, E, N, T, S, Y. So we have other letters to use.\n\nGiven that A is in position 4 or 5, we need to choose a word that:\n1. Has R at position 2.\n2. Contains A in either position 4 or 5 (we need to test which one).\n3. Uses letters that are not excluded and can help identify other letters.\n\nPotential letters: We haven\'t tested many vowels or consonants. Vowels available: O, I, U (since A is already present, but there might be more vowels). Consonants: many available such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Z.\n\nSince A is constrained to positions 4 or 5, I can make two different guesses to test these, but ideally, I\'d like to test both possibilities in one guess? That might be hard.\n\nAlternatively, I can choose a word that has A in position 4 and then another word for position 5? But I want to gain more information about other positions.\n\nIdea: guess a word that has A in position 4 and uses new common letters to test other positions.\n\nExample words with A at position 4 and pattern _ R _ A _ :\n\n- ""BROAD"": But O and D? And we haven\'t excluded O or D. However, let me check the letters: B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5). This uses O and D. But ""broad"" is a valid word.\n\nBut let me see if A is at position 5: pattern _ R _ _ A \n- ""FRIDA"": Not a word.\n- ""GRAMA"": Valid? Actually, ""gamma"" has two M\'s but that\'s different. ""GRAVA""? Not valid.\n\nAnother word for _ R _ A _ : \n- ""DROPA""? Not a word.\n- ""GROMA""? Not a word.\n- ""PROVA""? Not a word.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""FORAM""? Not common.\n\nAnother idea: ""ARMOR"" but then A is at position1? But we know position1 doesn\'t have A? And armor: A1, R2, M3, O4, R5. Also duplicate R? And position4 is O? Then A at position1? But feedback said A not at position1? So ""armor"" wouldn\'t be valid? Moreover, A is only allowed at 4 or 5? So it has to be at 4 or 5? So ""armor"" is invalid because A is at1.\n\nHow about ""WROAD""? Not a word.\n\nWhat about ""BREAD""? But E is excluded? Discard.\n\n""FRAUD"": \n  F(1), R(2), A(3) -> wait, A cannot be at position3? But our guess has A at position3? The pattern: F(1), R(2), A(3), U(4), D(5). But we know A is not at position3? So this is invalid? Because we are putting A in a position we know it cannot be? So if I guess ""FRAUD"", then A at position3 is going to get a \'-\'? And that\'s redundant? And it doesn\'t test A at position4 or5? Because we are guessing A at3.\n\nSo avoid any word that has A at position1 (not allowed), position2 (taken by R), position3 (already known not there). Only positions 4 and 5 are allowed.\n\nTherefore, we must choose words with A at either position4 or position5.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words ending with ""A"" (position5): _ R _ _ A\nExamples:\n- ""BARCA"": invalid word? \n- ""PARSA"": obscure?\n- ""TOROA"": invalid?\n- ""VIRGA"": valid? It\'s a noun meaning a streak of rain, but uncommon.\n\nCommon words: Not many common English words end with A? Except words like ""pizza"" (but we\'ve excluded Z and T? S also excluded?).\n\nWhat about ""URBAN""? But N is excluded? Discard.\n\nAnother: ""ORVAN""? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps not many for position5? So maybe position4 is more promising?\n\nPattern _ R _ A _\nExamples:\n- ""BROAD"": as above, valid.\n- ""CROAK"": C excluded -> discard.\n- ""DROOL"": D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5) -> no A? We need to include A? So we need to have A in position4.\n\nWait, pattern _ R _ A _ must have A at position4? Then the fifth letter can be anything? So:\n\n""FRAMED""? Too long? 5 letters: FRAME -> 5 letters? But E is excluded? And S? Not.\n\n""GRAMA"": a type of grass? Valid word? GRAMA: G R A M A? But then positions: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5)? Wait, that\'s A at position3 and position5? We are allowed A at position5? But we cannot have A at position3? So in the pattern we are constructing for a guess? If I guess ""grama"", then position3 is A? Then we get \'-\' for A at3? But we know that already? That wastes one slot? Then we want the A at position5 to test? \n\nSo ""GRAMA"" would be: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5)\nFeedback: \n  Position1: G\n  Position2: R (✓)\n  Position3: A -> known to be not here? So \'-\' (redundant)\n  Position4: M\n  Position5: A -> we are testing if it\'s at position5? But if the secret word has A only once? Then if the secret word has A at position4 or5? We will get double feedback? \n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has duplicate A\'s? So I guess we can try? However, ""GRAMA"" has two A\'s? \n\nBut let\'s note: our goal is to test if A is at position5? And if it is, then the fifth letter might be A? Also, we get to test G and M.\n\nAlternatively, I can choose a word without duplicate A? \n\nWhat for pattern with A at position4: _ R _ A _ \nWe have three positions: letter1, letter3, and letter5 to decide? We need a word? \n\nExamples: \n- ""BROAD"": B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5) -> no duplicate A? And avoids C,E,N,T,S,Y? Valid letters: B, O, D.\n\nOther options?\n- ""FROAD""? Not a word.\n- ""PROW A""? Not.\n- ""GROAN"": but N excluded -> discard.\n- ""GROWL"": no A? Needed.\n\n""WROAD""? Not valid.\n\nSo ""BROAD"" seems decent? Or ""DROID"": no A? \n\nWhat about ""AVAIL"": but A at1? Not allowed? And position2 must be R? So no.\n\nBut ""AVAIL"" doesn\'t fit the pattern? We are stuck? \n\nAnother idea:  _ R _ A _ \n- ""TRAMP"": has T? T is excluded -> discard.\n- ""CRAMP"": C excluded? Also T excluded? \n\n""GRAPE"": E excluded? \n\nAnother: ""BRAWL"": has A at position3? Not allowed? \n\nOR: ""PROUD"": no A? \n\nSo it\'s hard? \n\nHow about A at position5: _ R _ _ A with all new letters?\n\nWords:\n- ""VERA5"": not valid.\n- ""FURIA"": not common? \n- ""DUCAL"": D(1), U(2), ... but position2 must be R? \n\nPattern: letter1, R, letter3, letter4, A.\n\nSo that pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] A\n\nExamples:\n- ""PARMA"": P(1), R(2), M(3), A(4)? Wait: this has A at position4? But I\'m aiming for A at position5? Here position5 is undefined? \n\nWait, no: for position5? Then the word must be [ ] R [ ] [ ] A\nThen the last letter is A? So:\n\n- ""URBIA"": U(1), R(2), B(3), I(4), A(5) -> valid? But not common? \n- ""ORBIA""? Not a word.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""MEDIA"": but E and M? And position2 must be R? So not.\n\nAnother: ""India"": I(1), N(2) -> N excluded? And position2 isn\'t R? \n\n""AROBA"": A(1) -> but A cannot be at1? So reject? \n\nPerhaps ""RABAT""? But R at1? \n\nSo a word for _ R _ _ A:\n- ""BRADA"" not valid?\n- ""CREDA"" not valid?\n\n""GRUDA""? No.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider words that use fewer vowels? Or accept that ""BROAD"" is a valid choice for A at4? \n\nBut ""broad"" uses O and D? We haven\'t tested O and D? \n\nAnother common word: ""FORAM"" is not common? ""Framed"": 6 letters? \n\nPerhaps try for a word that tests multiple things? Like ""BRAVA"": B R A V A? Then position3 is A? We know A is not at position3? So that\'s bad? \n\nAfter reconsideration, I think ""BROAD"" is an acceptable choice? Because:\n- It has R at2? ✓\n- A at position4: we are testing A at a new position? If it\'s correct? Then position4 is A? If not? Then A must be at5?\n- Letters: B, O, D? All new? \n\nAnd it avoids the excluded letters? So let me go with that? \n\nIf I guess ""broad"", then the feedback on A at4: if it\'s \'-\'? Then A is in the word but not at4? Since we know A is present? Then it must be at position5? Because if it were at any other position? We have excluded positions 1,2,3? So position5 is the only other possibility? \n\nSimilarly, if A gets ✓ at4, then we solved position4? \n\nSo that\'s good information? \n\nIn fact, if we guess ""broad"", we will definitively place A?\n\nSo let me choose ""broad"".\n\nBut what about the other positions? We can also test B at1? O at3? D at5? \n\nSo it\'s a good word? \n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, guess: ""broad""\n\nSo: <guess>broad</guess>Based on the feedback from both guesses:  \n- **Crane feedback**: Eliminates C, N, E; confirms R in position 2 (✓); and shows A exists but not in position 3 (-).  \n- **Artsy feedback**: Confirms R again in position 2 (✓); eliminates T, S, Y; and shows A is not in position 1 (-).  \n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Pattern**: The word is `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed in position 2).  \n2. **A position**: Since A must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1–3 (already tested), it **must** be in position 4 or 5.  \n3. **Excluded letters**: C, E, N, T, S, Y cannot appear anywhere.  \n4. **Available letters**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W).  \n\n### Optimal Guess: BROAD\n- **Why?**  \n  - Tests A in **position 4** (since it can\'t be in 1–3, testing position 4 helps resolve ambiguity—if feedback is ✓, position 4 is solved; if -, A must be in position 5).  \n  - Uses new common letters: B (position 1), O (position 3), D (position 5) to maximize information.  \n  - Avoids excluded letters and efficiently narrows possibilities.\n\n<guess>broad</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: artsy -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: broad -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(x) A(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>

Meaning:
- A is present but not in position 1 (guessed at position 1).
- R is still correct at position 2.
- T, S, Y are not in the word.

Guess 3: broad
Feedback: B(x) R(✓) O(x) A(✓) D(x)
Meaning:
- B, O, D are not in the word (x).
- R is correct at position 2 (✓).
- A is correct at position 4 (✓).

Combining all feedback:

1. The secret word has R in position 2 and A in position 4.
   So the pattern is: _ R _ A _

2. We know the following letters are NOT in the word: C, E, N, T, S, Y, B, O, D.

3. From guess 1, A is present (and now placed at position 4). A was not at position 1 or 3 (confirmed by artsy and crane feedback).

Therefore, the word is: [letter1] R [letter3] A [letter5]

We only need to determine the first, third, and fifth letters? But note: we know letter4 is A? And we have feedback for broad showing A✓ at position4? And we also know that letter2 is R? 

The pattern: position1: ?, position2: R (fixed), position3: ?, position4: A (fixed), position5: ?

And excluded letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y, B, O, D.

The letter3 is unknown? And we know letter3 cannot be O? Also, letter1 cannot be B? And letter5 cannot be D? But also, we must avoid all excluded letters.

So the remaining letters? We have many letters left? Vowels? U, I? Consonants? F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? 

But note: the word must be a valid English word? 

Common letters? 

Also, from the first guess (crane): we had A at position3 which was wrong? But we used crane at position3? Now we know position3 is still unknown? 

However, the excluded letters are listed? 

So possibilities for the missing positions:

Position1: anything except B, C, E, N, T, S, Y? So from the alphabet: A? But A is already used? And we know A? But we can use another A? The secret word might have two A's? It's possible? But from the feedback, we don't know? 

In broad, we guessed A only at position4? And got a check? So that doesn't tell us if the word has another A? But since we haven't guessed A elsewhere? We can consider it? 

But currently, we are missing positions 1,3,5? 

We avoid: B, C, D, E, N, O, T, S, Y? And also? Wait, the excluded letters: 

- From crane: C, N, E
- From artsy: T, S, Y
- From broad: B, O, D

So excluded: B, C, D, E, N, O, T, S, Y.

Thus available letters? A to Z excluding these: A, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But we know the word ends in A? So for position5: it could be any letter? Including A? Or another letter? 

However, position4 is A? So pattern: _ R _ A _ 

Now, we can try to form words? 

For example: 

- U R ? A ? 

Common words? 

Possible words:

- ""URBAN"": but N excluded? 
- ""URVAS""? Not valid? 

Others:

- ""FUGUE""? Not? 

Common words: 

- ""GRAPE"" -> but E excluded and G? And P? Actually: G would be position1? R at2, A at4? So pattern: G R ? A E? But E excluded? 

Perhaps:

- ""GRAMA"" -> but we already excluded letters? And also A at position3? 

How about ""GRIEF""? E excluded? 

Another? ""FRAIL"" -> but A is at position3? Not? Pattern? F R A I L? Then position4 is I? Not A? So not matching? 

But our pattern requires position4 to be A? 

So the word must have exactly the pattern: [1]R[3]A[5]

So the third letter is the tricky one? 

Known words? 

- ""ARIAS""? Not? Pattern: A R I A S? So positions: A at1 and A at4? And S? But S is excluded? 

Excluded letters: S? So discard? 

Another: ""TRIAC""? C excluded? and also T? 

What about ""VIRGA"": but V I R G A? Pattern? V at1, position2 is R? Then I at3? G at4? A at5? But we require position4 to be A? So this: position4 is G, not A? So invalid pattern? 

Our requirement: position4 is A? So the pattern must be: [letter1] R [letter3] A [letter5]

For example: 

- ""IRATE"": I at1, R at2, A at3? But position4 must be A? So pattern: I R A T E? Then position4 is T? Not A? So invalid? 

Actually: if we write the pattern: 
Position1: I? 
Position2: R? 
Position3: A? 
Position4: T? 
Position5: E? 

But we require position4 to be A? So the third position is letter3? And fourth is A? 

Therefore, candidate words: 

- ""KRAAL"": K R A A L? But then position3 is A? But we know A is not in position3? From the first guess? Because ""crane"" had A at position3 and got '-'? Meaning A is in the word but not at position3? 

Therefore, we can't have A at position3? So words with A at position3 are invalid? 

Wait: the pattern we have: position3 is NOT A? Because A is confirmed at position4 and cannot be at position3? So the third letter cannot be A? It must be a different letter? 

Therefore, the pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] A [letter5] where letter3 is NOT A? 

So back to ""KRAAL"": if we guess it? Then pattern: K(1), R(2), A(3) -> but A cannot be at position3? So that would be an error? 

So we need words like:

- ""BREVE"" -> but B,E excluded? 
- ""CREPE"" -> C excluded? 

How about:

- ""PRIMA"": P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5) -> ah! But now we know position4 is A? So pattern: _ R [letter3 not A] A [letter5]? So in ""PRIMA"", if position4 was A? Then it would be: P R I M A? Then position4 is M? Not A? That doesn't work? 

We need position4 to be A? So for example: 

- Let me think of words that end with ... R? A? 

Pattern: X R Y A Z? 

For example: ""BRAVA"" -> B R A V A? Then positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), A(5)? But here position4 is V? Not A? So that doesn't satisfy position4=A? 

We need the fourth letter to be A? So it must be a word that has the form: first letter R second letter third letter? fourth letter is A? fifth letter? 

Valid words: 
- ""FROGS""? Position4? G? 

Another: ""AROMA"": A R O M A? Then position3 is O? Position4 is M? Not A? 

Wait, perhaps: 
- ""ORCGA""? No? 

How about ""UMIAQ"": U R? Not matching? 

Perhaps I'm missing: words like ""QUEEN""? Doesn't fit? 

Another idea: ""AGORA"": A G O R A? Then pattern: A at1, G at2? No R at position2? Not our pattern? 

We need R at position2? 

Let me search mentally: 

- ""CRAWL"" -> C and L? Excluded? 

""PRAWN"": P R A W N? But N excluded? 

""BRAWN"": B and W and N? Excluded? B and N? 

""DRAIN"": D R A I N? N excluded? 

""GRAIN"": G R A I N? N excluded? 

""TRAIT"": T excluded? 

""PRAHU"": P R A H U? Then position3 is A? But we know A cannot be at position3? Also, pattern would be P R A H U? So position4 is H, not A? 

So we need pattern: R followed by ??? but specifically: letter at index0 (1st) any, index1 R, index2 any (not A), index3 A, index4 any? 

So a word:  letter1, R, letter3 (not A), letter4=A, letter5

For example: ""ARTAL"" -> but T? Excluded? and L? 

ARTAL is not common? 

""ARGAL"": T and L? 

How about ""ARVAL""? 6 letters? 

Another: ""MANGA"": M at1? R? Not? 

Perhaps ""ARGON"" -> but O excluded? N excluded? 

Wait: ""ARGOT"": excluded T? 

Perhaps: ""MANIA""? M at1? Then R? Not? 

I'm stuck? Let's try vowel letters? 

For position3, we have: vowels available: I, U, and consonants? 

Words:
- ""PRIZE"" -> Z? But we haven't tested Z? And E excluded? 

""PRIVY"": V? And Y excluded? 

""PRISM"": S excluded? 

""CRIMP"": C excluded? 

""FRAIM""? Not a word? 

Another: ""URAEI""? Not matching? 

Perhaps the word is ""URIAL"": U R I A L? Then: U(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), L(5)? YES! 

Pattern: U R I A L? 

Positions:
  Position1: U
  Position2: R
  Position3: I
  Position4: A
  Position5: L

Now, check against feedback? 

1. U: not tested? 
I: not tested? 
L: not tested? 

Excluded letters? U, I, L are not in the excluded list? 

Available? 

Also, A is at position4? Fixed? 

But is ""URIAL"" a valid English word? It is: a type of wild sheep? Or goat? 

Yes, it is acceptable? 

But let me check? 

In the first guess, ""crane"": we had A at position3? And got '-'? Which means A is in the word but not at position3? And ""URIAL"" has A at position4? So that's consistent? 

In guess2: ""artsy"": we had A not at position1? Correct? 

In guess3: ""broad"": B at1? Excluded? R at2✓? O at3 excluded? A at4✓? D at5 excluded? 

So ""URIAL"" hasn't been ruled out? 

But we also have position3: I? Which is unknown? 

Are there any other words? 

Another possibility: ""ORCAS""? No, O excluded? 

""UNICA"": U N I C A? But N and C excluded? 

""VIGIA"": V I G I A? Pattern: V(1), I(2)? Not R? 

So ""URIAL"" seems a candidate? 

Another candidate? ""JUMAR""? J R? No? 

""QUART"": Q U A R T? Then pattern: Q U A R T? Position2 is A? Not R? 

No? 

How about ""KRIAS""? K R I A S? But S excluded? 

""FLORA"": F L O R A? Then position2 is L? Not R? 

""GRASS""? G R A S S? Then position4 is S? Not A? And S excluded? 

Perhaps ""GRAFT"": G R A F T? Then position3 is A? But A cannot be at position3? 

Therefore, ""URIAL"" is a good candidate? 

But I also think of ""MERMA""? But E excluded? 

Perhaps ""HORAH""? O excluded? 

So for now, I guess ""URIAL"" 

But wait: We haven't used letters in position3? 

Other possibilities? 

""VIRGA"": we thought earlier? But pattern: V I R G A? Then position2 is I? Not R? 

So no? 

Therefore, ""URIAL"" seems the only common word I can think of? 

If the word is ""URIAL"", then:

Guess4: U R I A L

But let me confirm: 
Letters: U, R, I, A, L
Excluded: B,C,D,E,N,O,T,S,Y are excluded? U not excluded? R is allowed? I? L? A is used? 

Position4 is A? Confirmed? 

Position3: we don't know? But if we get it, then we can see? 

But I also must consider: the word might have duplicate A? For example: ""ARAQU""? Not valid.

So I will go with ""URIAL"".

Alternatively: ""PRIMI"" doesn't fit? 

Therefore, <guess>urial</guess> 

But note: I think of ""FRIED"" but E excluded? 

So I say: 

Guess4: urial
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyzing Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
     - C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
     → R is in position 2 (fixed).  
     → A is in the word but not in position 3.  
     → C, N, E are absent.  
   - **Guess 2 (artsy)**:  
     - A(-), R(✓), T(x), S(x), Y(x)  
     → A is not in position 1.  
     → T, S, Y are absent.  
     → Combined with Guess 1, A cannot be in positions 1, 2 (R's spot), or 3 → A must be in position 4 or 5.  
   - **Guess 3 (broad)**:  
     - B(x), R(✓), O(x), A(✓), D(x)  
     → A is fixed in position 4 (✓).  
     → B, O, D are absent.  
     → Resolves A's position: now fixed at position 4.  

2. **Current Word Pattern**:  
   - Pattern: _ R _ A _  
   - Position 2 = R, Position 4 = A (both fixed).  
   - Positions to guess: 1, 3, 5 (letter3 cannot be A, as per Guess 1 feedback).  

3. **Excluded Letters**:  
   All absent letters from feedback: B, C, D, E, N, O, T, S, Y (so 9 letters excluded).  
   - Available vowels: I, U (since A is placed).  
   - Available consonants: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  

4. **Deducing Possible Words**:  
   - Words must fit the pattern _ R _ A _ and use available letters.  
   - Examples considered:  
     - ""URIAL"": U(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), L(5) → Fits pattern and rules:  
       - U, I, L not excluded.  
       - Letter3 = I (not A, as required).  
     - ""URIAL"" is a valid English word (a type of wild sheep).  
   - Eliminated alternatives:  
     - ""KRAAL"" → Invalid: letter3 = A (disallowed from Guess 1).  
     - ""ORCAS""/""AROMA""/""BRAVA"" → Invalid: O/S/B excluded or pattern mismatch.  
     - ""PRIMA""/""CRIMP"" → Invalid: S/O/C excluded or position 4 ≠ A.  
     - ""FRAUD""/""BROAD"" → Invalid: D/B excluded or already guessed.  

5. **Why ""URIAL""?**  
   - Tests position 3 (I) and positions 1/5 (U/L) with common available letters.  
   - Resolves uncertainty: If ✓ for U/I/L, positions are validated; if not, narrows remaining letters.  
   - Only 3 letters left to confirm (U, I, L), maximizing information with unknown but plausible letters.  

<guess>urial</guess>",urial,"We have three sets of feedback:

Guess 1: crane
Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word and in position 2.
- A is in the word, but not in position 3 (since it was guessed at position 3).
- C, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: artsy
Feedback: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)
Meaning:
- A is present but not in position 1 (guessed at position 1).
- R is still correct at position 2.
- T, S, Y are not in the word.

Guess 3: broad
Feedback: B(x) R(✓) O(x) A(✓) D(x)
Meaning:
- B, O, D are not in the word (x).
- R is correct at position 2 (✓).
- A is correct at position 4 (✓).

Combining all feedback:

1. The secret word has R in position 2 and A in position 4.
   So the pattern is: _ R _ A _

2. We know the following letters are NOT in the word: C, E, N, T, S, Y, B, O, D.

3. From guess 1, A is present (and now placed at position 4). A was not at position 1 or 3 (confirmed by artsy and crane feedback).

Therefore, the word is: [letter1] R [letter3] A [letter5]

We only need to determine the first, third, and fifth letters? But note: we know letter4 is A? And we have feedback for broad showing A✓ at position4? And we also know that letter2 is R? 

The pattern: position1: ?, position2: R (fixed), position3: ?, position4: A (fixed), position5: ?

And excluded letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y, B, O, D.

The letter3 is unknown? And we know letter3 cannot be O? Also, letter1 cannot be B? And letter5 cannot be D? But also, we must avoid all excluded letters.

So the remaining letters? We have many letters left? Vowels? U, I? Consonants? F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? 

But note: the word must be a valid English word? 

Common letters? 

Also, from the first guess (crane): we had A at position3 which was wrong? But we used crane at position3? Now we know position3 is still unknown? 

However, the excluded letters are listed? 

So possibilities for the missing positions:

Position1: anything except B, C, E, N, T, S, Y? So from the alphabet: A? But A is already used? And we know A? But we can use another A? The secret word might have two A's? It's possible? But from the feedback, we don't know? 

In broad, we guessed A only at position4? And got a check? So that doesn't tell us if the word has another A? But since we haven't guessed A elsewhere? We can consider it? 

But currently, we are missing positions 1,3,5? 

We avoid: B, C, D, E, N, O, T, S, Y? And also? Wait, the excluded letters: 

- From crane: C, N, E
- From artsy: T, S, Y
- From broad: B, O, D

So excluded: B, C, D, E, N, O, T, S, Y.

Thus available letters? A to Z excluding these: A, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But we know the word ends in A? So for position5: it could be any letter? Including A? Or another letter? 

However, position4 is A? So pattern: _ R _ A _ 

Now, we can try to form words? 

For example: 

- U R ? A ? 

Common words? 

Possible words:

- ""URBAN"": but N excluded? 
- ""URVAS""? Not valid? 

Others:

- ""FUGUE""? Not? 

Common words: 

- ""GRAPE"" -> but E excluded and G? And P? Actually: G would be position1? R at2, A at4? So pattern: G R ? A E? But E excluded? 

Perhaps:

- ""GRAMA"" -> but we already excluded letters? And also A at position3? 

How about ""GRIEF""? E excluded? 

Another? ""FRAIL"" -> but A is at position3? Not? Pattern? F R A I L? Then position4 is I? Not A? So not matching? 

But our pattern requires position4 to be A? 

So the word must have exactly the pattern: [1]R[3]A[5]

So the third letter is the tricky one? 

Known words? 

- ""ARIAS""? Not? Pattern: A R I A S? So positions: A at1 and A at4? And S? But S is excluded? 

Excluded letters: S? So discard? 

Another: ""TRIAC""? C excluded? and also T? 

What about ""VIRGA"": but V I R G A? Pattern? V at1, position2 is R? Then I at3? G at4? A at5? But we require position4 to be A? So this: position4 is G, not A? So invalid pattern? 

Our requirement: position4 is A? So the pattern must be: [letter1] R [letter3] A [letter5]

For example: 

- ""IRATE"": I at1, R at2, A at3? But position4 must be A? So pattern: I R A T E? Then position4 is T? Not A? So invalid? 

Actually: if we write the pattern: 
Position1: I? 
Position2: R? 
Position3: A? 
Position4: T? 
Position5: E? 

But we require position4 to be A? So the third position is letter3? And fourth is A? 

Therefore, candidate words: 

- ""KRAAL"": K R A A L? But then position3 is A? But we know A is not in position3? From the first guess? Because ""crane"" had A at position3 and got '-'? Meaning A is in the word but not at position3? 

Therefore, we can't have A at position3? So words with A at position3 are invalid? 

Wait: the pattern we have: position3 is NOT A? Because A is confirmed at position4 and cannot be at position3? So the third letter cannot be A? It must be a different letter? 

Therefore, the pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] A [letter5] where letter3 is NOT A? 

So back to ""KRAAL"": if we guess it? Then pattern: K(1), R(2), A(3) -> but A cannot be at position3? So that would be an error? 

So we need words like:

- ""BREVE"" -> but B,E excluded? 
- ""CREPE"" -> C excluded? 

How about:

- ""PRIMA"": P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5) -> ah! But now we know position4 is A? So pattern: _ R [letter3 not A] A [letter5]? So in ""PRIMA"", if position4 was A? Then it would be: P R I M A? Then position4 is M? Not A? That doesn't work? 

We need position4 to be A? So for example: 

- Let me think of words that end with ... R? A? 

Pattern: X R Y A Z? 

For example: ""BRAVA"" -> B R A V A? Then positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), A(5)? But here position4 is V? Not A? So that doesn't satisfy position4=A? 

We need the fourth letter to be A? So it must be a word that has the form: first letter R second letter third letter? fourth letter is A? fifth letter? 

Valid words: 
- ""FROGS""? Position4? G? 

Another: ""AROMA"": A R O M A? Then position3 is O? Position4 is M? Not A? 

Wait, perhaps: 
- ""ORCGA""? No? 

How about ""UMIAQ"": U R? Not matching? 

Perhaps I'm missing: words like ""QUEEN""? Doesn't fit? 

Another idea: ""AGORA"": A G O R A? Then pattern: A at1, G at2? No R at position2? Not our pattern? 

We need R at position2? 

Let me search mentally: 

- ""CRAWL"" -> C and L? Excluded? 

""PRAWN"": P R A W N? But N excluded? 

""BRAWN"": B and W and N? Excluded? B and N? 

""DRAIN"": D R A I N? N excluded? 

""GRAIN"": G R A I N? N excluded? 

""TRAIT"": T excluded? 

""PRAHU"": P R A H U? Then position3 is A? But we know A cannot be at position3? Also, pattern would be P R A H U? So position4 is H, not A? 

So we need pattern: R followed by ??? but specifically: letter at index0 (1st) any, index1 R, index2 any (not A), index3 A, index4 any? 

So a word:  letter1, R, letter3 (not A), letter4=A, letter5

For example: ""ARTAL"" -> but T? Excluded? and L? 

ARTAL is not common? 

""ARGAL"": T and L? 

How about ""ARVAL""? 6 letters? 

Another: ""MANGA"": M at1? R? Not? 

Perhaps ""ARGON"" -> but O excluded? N excluded? 

Wait: ""ARGOT"": excluded T? 

Perhaps: ""MANIA""? M at1? Then R? Not? 

I'm stuck? Let's try vowel letters? 

For position3, we have: vowels available: I, U, and consonants? 

Words:
- ""PRIZE"" -> Z? But we haven't tested Z? And E excluded? 

""PRIVY"": V? And Y excluded? 

""PRISM"": S excluded? 

""CRIMP"": C excluded? 

""FRAIM""? Not a word? 

Another: ""URAEI""? Not matching? 

Perhaps the word is ""URIAL"": U R I A L? Then: U(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), L(5)? YES! 

Pattern: U R I A L? 

Positions:
  Position1: U
  Position2: R
  Position3: I
  Position4: A
  Position5: L

Now, check against feedback? 

1. U: not tested? 
I: not tested? 
L: not tested? 

Excluded letters? U, I, L are not in the excluded list? 

Available? 

Also, A is at position4? Fixed? 

But is ""URIAL"" a valid English word? It is: a type of wild sheep? Or goat? 

Yes, it is acceptable? 

But let me check? 

In the first guess, ""crane"": we had A at position3? And got '-'? Which means A is in the word but not at position3? And ""URIAL"" has A at position4? So that's consistent? 

In guess2: ""artsy"": we had A not at position1? Correct? 

In guess3: ""broad"": B at1? Excluded? R at2✓? O at3 excluded? A at4✓? D at5 excluded? 

So ""URIAL"" hasn't been ruled out? 

But we also have position3: I? Which is unknown? 

Are there any other words? 

Another possibility: ""ORCAS""? No, O excluded? 

""UNICA"": U N I C A? But N and C excluded? 

""VIGIA"": V I G I A? Pattern: V(1), I(2)? Not R? 

So ""URIAL"" seems a candidate? 

Another candidate? ""JUMAR""? J R? No? 

""QUART"": Q U A R T? Then pattern: Q U A R T? Position2 is A? Not R? 

No? 

How about ""KRIAS""? K R I A S? But S excluded? 

""FLORA"": F L O R A? Then position2 is L? Not R? 

""GRASS""? G R A S S? Then position4 is S? Not A? And S excluded? 

Perhaps ""GRAFT"": G R A F T? Then position3 is A? But A cannot be at position3? 

Therefore, ""URIAL"" is a good candidate? 

But I also think of ""MERMA""? But E excluded? 

Perhaps ""HORAH""? O excluded? 

So for now, I guess ""URIAL"" 

But wait: We haven't used letters in position3? 

Other possibilities? 

""VIRGA"": we thought earlier? But pattern: V I R G A? Then position2 is I? Not R? 

So no? 

Therefore, ""URIAL"" seems the only common word I can think of? 

If the word is ""URIAL"", then:

Guess4: U R I A L

But let me confirm: 
Letters: U, R, I, A, L
Excluded: B,C,D,E,N,O,T,S,Y are excluded? U not excluded? R is allowed? I? L? A is used? 

Position4 is A? Confirmed? 

Position3: we don't know? But if we get it, then we can see? 

But I also must consider: the word might have duplicate A? For example: ""ARAQU""? Not valid.

So I will go with ""URIAL"".

Alternatively: ""PRIMI"" doesn't fit? 

Therefore, <guess>urial</guess> 

But note: I think of ""FRIED"" but E excluded? 

So I say: 

Guess4: urial### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyzing Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
     - C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
     → R is in position 2 (fixed).  
     → A is in the word but not in position 3.  
     → C, N, E are absent.  
   - **Guess 2 (artsy)**:  
     - A(-), R(✓), T(x), S(x), Y(x)  
     → A is not in position 1.  
     → T, S, Y are absent.  
     → Combined with Guess 1, A cannot be in positions 1, 2 (R's spot), or 3 → A must be in position 4 or 5.  
   - **Guess 3 (broad)**:  
     - B(x), R(✓), O(x), A(✓), D(x)  
     → A is fixed in position 4 (✓).  
     → B, O, D are absent.  
     → Resolves A's position: now fixed at position 4.  

2. **Current Word Pattern**:  
   - Pattern: _ R _ A _  
   - Position 2 = R, Position 4 = A (both fixed).  
   - Positions to guess: 1, 3, 5 (letter3 cannot be A, as per Guess 1 feedback).  

3. **Excluded Letters**:  
   All absent letters from feedback: B, C, D, E, N, O, T, S, Y (so 9 letters excluded).  
   - Available vowels: I, U (since A is placed).  
   - Available consonants: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  

4. **Deducing Possible Words**:  
   - Words must fit the pattern _ R _ A _ and use available letters.  
   - Examples considered:  
     - ""URIAL"": U(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), L(5) → Fits pattern and rules:  
       - U, I, L not excluded.  
       - Letter3 = I (not A, as required).  
     - ""URIAL"" is a valid English word (a type of wild sheep).  
   - Eliminated alternatives:  
     - ""KRAAL"" → Invalid: letter3 = A (disallowed from Guess 1).  
     - ""ORCAS""/""AROMA""/""BRAVA"" → Invalid: O/S/B excluded or pattern mismatch.  
     - ""PRIMA""/""CRIMP"" → Invalid: S/O/C excluded or position 4 ≠ A.  
     - ""FRAUD""/""BROAD"" → Invalid: D/B excluded or already guessed.  

5. **Why ""URIAL""?**  
   - Tests position 3 (I) and positions 1/5 (U/L) with common available letters.  
   - Resolves uncertainty: If ✓ for U/I/L, positions are validated; if not, narrows remaining letters.  
   - Only 3 letters left to confirm (U, I, L), maximizing information with unknown but plausible letters.",Guess 4: urial -> FEEDBACK: U(x) R(✓) I(✓) A(✓) L(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,friar,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)

 This means:
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2). So the second letter of the secret word is R.
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it's present, but not in the first position? Note: our guess had A in position 3 because C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)). Therefore, A is somewhere in the word but not in position 3.
 - C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has:
   Position 2: R
   Contains A, but not at position 3.
   Does not contain C, N, E.

 Therefore, the word is of the form: _ R _ _ _

 Since A is not at position 3 and also not at position 2 (which is R), it must be at position 1, 4, or 5.

 But note: we also know A cannot be at position 1? Why? Because we don't have information about position 1 yet. Actually, it could be at position 1, 4, or 5.

 We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We know we cannot use C, N, E again. We must use A again, and we know R is fixed at position 2.

 For our next guess, we want to maximize the information. We should try to test common letters and also try to place A in possible positions.

 Since A is known to be in the word but not at position 3, let's try to put A in a different position to see if it fits.

 Also, we need to avoid the letters C, N, E.

 Possibilities for A: position 1, 4, or 5.

 Let me think of words that have R as the second letter, contain A, and do not contain C, N, E.

 Some common words: 
   We can try ""PARTY"" -> but we are avoiding the letter E? Wait, E is out, but T and Y are new.

 However, note: we have limited knowledge. Another idea: we could try a word that uses other common vowels and consonants.

 But we also know that the word doesn't contain E, so vowels we can use are: A (we know), and others like I, O, U.

 Also, we haven't tried letters like T, S, L, etc.

 Let me think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and include A (somewhere but position 3) and exclude C, N, E.

 Examples:
   BRAVO? -> But we have O, which we haven't tested. Also, we have B and V. And A would be at position 3? Wait, position 3 is the third letter -> BRAVO: B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), O(5). But our feedback said A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback for our guess ""crane"" had A at position 3 and said A(-) meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So putting A at position 3 in a new guess would be inconsistent? Actually, in the new guess we can put it anywhere because we are testing. But note: we know that if we put A at position 3 in a new guess and it turns out to be correct, then we might misinterpret the feedback? Actually, the feedback will tell us if the letter is correct.

 However, let's recall the rules: the feedback is absolute. If we guess a word with A at position 3, and if the secret word has A at a different position (not 3) then we will get a '-' because A exists but in wrong place. And if the secret word does not have A at all? But we know from the first guess that A is present.

 So, to test position 3 again for A? Actually, we know it's not at position 3 from the first feedback? How? The first guess has A at position 3 and the feedback was '-' meaning the A is present but not at position 3. Therefore, regardless of what we do, the secret word does not have A at position 3.

 Therefore, if we guess ""BRAVO"":
   A is again at position 3? Then the feedback for A must be '-' (since we know A isn't at position 3) but that wouldn't tell us anything new. So we don't want to put A in position 3 again.

 Instead, we should try to place A in a new position: either 1, 4, or 5.

 Consider: 
   Position 1: such as ""TRACK"" -> but invalid because of C and we don't use E? But C is excluded so we cannot use it? And ""TRACK"" contains C -> discard.

   How about ""BROAD""? 
      Position 1: B, 2: R, 3: O, 4: A, 5: D.
      This has A at position 4, which is allowed. And letters: B, R, O, A, D -> none of C, N, E.

   Or ""DRAIN""? But N is excluded -> discard.

   Or ""GRAPE""? E is excluded -> discard.

   Or ""TRAIL"": 
      Position 1: T, 2: R, 3: A -> but A cannot be at position 3? Then we know that if we guess TRAIL and A is at 3, it will be marked '-' because we know A is not at 3. So that would waste a slot? We want to test other positions.

   Therefore, let's avoid putting A at position 3. Instead, let me try:

   Option: ""PARTY"": 
      P(1), A(2) -> Wait, position 2 is R? So we cannot put A at position 2 because position 2 is R. 
      Correction: The word must have R at position 2. So ""PARTY"" would be: P(1), A(2)? -> No, that's conflict because position 2 must be R.

   So we can't put A at position 2 because that position is fixed as R.

   Therefore, A can only be at position 1, 4, or 5? Actually, position 1, 4, or 5.

   Example words with R as the second letter and A at position 1: 
      ""ARISE"": But E is excluded -> discard.
      ""AROMA"": M is new? And O at 4? -> A(1), R(2), O(3), M(4), A(5) -> but we have two A's? And also, we don't know about O and M.

   But note: the word might have duplicates? The rules don't forbid duplicates? Actually, in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? However, the example given does not have duplicates. But let's stick to words that haven't been excluded.

   ""BRAVE"": but E is excluded -> discard.

   ""CRATE"": has C and E -> discard.

   ""DRAMA"": D(1), R(2), A(3) -> but we know A cannot be at position 3? So then A(3) would be wrong? Also, duplicate A? 
        We don't know if the word has duplicates. But if we guess ""drama"", then the A at position 3 would be marked '-' (if present elsewhere) and the A at position 5 might be marked appropriately.

   However, a better idea: let's choose a word that avoids reused letters and tests new letters.

   Another word: ""PARTS"": P(1), A(2) -> wait, second letter must be R? So we need: _ R _ _ _
        So we cannot have A at the second letter? Because the second letter is R.

   Correct: the word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

   So we can have A at position1: A R _ _ _ 
        Example: ""ARTIC"" -> has C? Discard.
        ""ARDOR"": has O and R again? Also duplicates? And we don't know about O and D.

   Position4: _ R _ A _
        Example: ""TRUAD""? Not a word. 
        ""GRAND"": but N excluded -> discard.
        ""WROAD""? Not a word.

   Position5: _ R _ _ A
        Example: ""BARCA""? Not a word.
        ""FORMA""? But M and F? And O? 
        ""PRIMA"": P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5) -> this is valid.

   So let's consider ""PRIMA"": 
        Letters: P, R, I, M, A -> all new except R and A (and A we know is present). Also avoids C, E, N.

   However, we are not sure if A is at position5? But this guess tests that.

   If we guess ""PRIMA"":
      If the secret word has A at position5, we might get a check for A? But the feedback will tell.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position1: ""ARTSY"" -> T, S, Y? But R must be at position2? That word: A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4), Y(5). That works. And letters: A,R,T,S,Y -> no C, E, N.

   So compare ""ARTSY"" and ""PRIMA"".

   Both seem valid. Which one gives more information?

   ""ARTSY"" tests: 
      Position1: A -> we know A is present, so if it gets ✓ then good, but if it gets '-' then we know A is at position4 or 5? Actually, if it gets ✓ then A is at 1? Then we solved position1. But if it gets '-' that means A is in the word but not at position1? Then since we know it's not at 3, it must be at 4 or 5.

   Also, ""ARTSY"" tests T at position3, S at position4, Y at position5.

   Similarly, ""PRIMA"" tests P at position1, I at position3, M at position4, A at position5.

   Both words are valid.

   But note: in ""ARTSY"", we are using S and T which are common letters.

   Alternatively, we could use ""TRAWL"": 
        T(1), R(2), A(3), W(4), L(5) -> but A would be at position3? And we know A isn't at position3? So then the A in position3 would be marked as '-'? That would be redundant? Because we already know A isn't at position3. So it would waste one slot? Then we only get new information for T, W, L.

   Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position3.

   So between ""ARTSY"" and ""PRIMA"", I think ""ARTSY"" is better because it uses very common letters: T, S, and Y.

   Also, it avoids repeating a position we know A doesn't go? Because A is at position1? 

   Moreover, if the word does not have A at position1 and we get a feedback of '-' for A, then we know A must be at 4 or 5.

   So I will go with ""ARTSY"".

   But note: we have used the letter R again? We know it's correct at position2, so we don't need to change that.

   So let's guess ""ARTSY"".

   But wait: the feedback for the first guess indicated that A is in the word. If we put A at a new position (position1), what if the secret word has A at position4 or 5? Then we get A at position1 marked as '-', meaning that A is present but not at 1, but we don't know which one? And we also are testing T, S, Y.

   Alternatively, we could try ""PURDA"" or ""WORDY"", but I think ""ARTSY"" is a good choice.

   Another word: ""TARES"", but E is excluded -> discard.

   So I will go with ""ARTSY"".

   Steps:
      Guess 2: ""ARTSY""

   But let me double-check: 
      Position 1: A -> we know A is present, so if it's not at 3, it might be at 1? We are testing.
      Position 2: R -> already known to be correct, so ✓ expected? Actually, in the feedback, we hope to get R(✓) at position2.
      Position 3: T -> unknown
      Position 4: S -> unknown
      Position 5: Y -> unknown

   We avoid C, E, N.

   So let's output ""ARTSY"".

   Alternatively, if we want to test multiple possibilities at once? We know that A must be at 1,4, or 5? What word could test A at 1 and also at 4 and 5? But that is impossible. So we choose a position to test.

   Also, note that the secret word might have two A's? It's possible? But since we haven't encountered any duplicate feedback? We don't know. But we will see.

   I think ""ARTSY"" is a reasonable choice.

<guess>artsy</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is confirmed in the second position (✓).
- A is present in the secret word but not in the third position (-).
- C, N, and E are absent from the word (x).

The secret word adheres to the pattern: _ R _ _ _ (where the second letter is R). The letter A must appear in either position 1, 4, or 5, since it cannot be in positions 2 (occupied by R) or 3 (confirmed by the first feedback). Letters C, N, and E are excluded.

For the next guess, I chose ""artsy"" for the following reasons:
- It keeps R in position 2 (already confirmed).
- It tests A in position 1, which is one of the possible positions for A (if A is in position 1, we'll get ✓; if not, we'll get - and know A must be in position 4 or 5).
- It introduces new common consonants (T in position 3, S in position 4, Y in position 5) to maximize information.
- It avoids excluded letters (C, N, E).

<guess>artsy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: artsy -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

First guess: crane
Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word and in position 2 (correct).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and got ""-"").
- C, N, E are not in the word.

Second guess: artsy
Feedback: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)
Meaning:
- R is again confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- A is present (we knew that) but NOT in position 1 (since we guessed it in position 1 and got ""-"").
- T, S, Y are not in the word.

Combining information:

- The word has R in position 2.
- The letter A is in the word but not in positions 1, 2 (position 2 is R), or 3. Therefore, A must be in position 4 or 5.

- Excluded letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y (from the feedback x's).
- Letters we know are in the word: A (somewhere) and R (at position 2). Additionally, from the first guess, we also inferred A is present.

So the word pattern is: _ R _ _ _ 
We know the word must contain A in either the 4th or 5th position.

Available letters: We must avoid C, E, N, T, S, Y. So we have other letters to use.

Given that A is in position 4 or 5, we need to choose a word that:
1. Has R at position 2.
2. Contains A in either position 4 or 5 (we need to test which one).
3. Uses letters that are not excluded and can help identify other letters.

Potential letters: We haven't tested many vowels or consonants. Vowels available: O, I, U (since A is already present, but there might be more vowels). Consonants: many available such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Z.

Since A is constrained to positions 4 or 5, I can make two different guesses to test these, but ideally, I'd like to test both possibilities in one guess? That might be hard.

Alternatively, I can choose a word that has A in position 4 and then another word for position 5? But I want to gain more information about other positions.

Idea: guess a word that has A in position 4 and uses new common letters to test other positions.

Example words with A at position 4 and pattern _ R _ A _ :

- ""BROAD"": But O and D? And we haven't excluded O or D. However, let me check the letters: B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5). This uses O and D. But ""broad"" is a valid word.

But let me see if A is at position 5: pattern _ R _ _ A 
- ""FRIDA"": Not a word.
- ""GRAMA"": Valid? Actually, ""gamma"" has two M's but that's different. ""GRAVA""? Not valid.

Another word for _ R _ A _ : 
- ""DROPA""? Not a word.
- ""GROMA""? Not a word.
- ""PROVA""? Not a word.

Common words: 
- ""FORAM""? Not common.

Another idea: ""ARMOR"" but then A is at position1? But we know position1 doesn't have A? And armor: A1, R2, M3, O4, R5. Also duplicate R? And position4 is O? Then A at position1? But feedback said A not at position1? So ""armor"" wouldn't be valid? Moreover, A is only allowed at 4 or 5? So it has to be at 4 or 5? So ""armor"" is invalid because A is at1.

How about ""WROAD""? Not a word.

What about ""BREAD""? But E is excluded? Discard.

""FRAUD"": 
  F(1), R(2), A(3) -> wait, A cannot be at position3? But our guess has A at position3? The pattern: F(1), R(2), A(3), U(4), D(5). But we know A is not at position3? So this is invalid? Because we are putting A in a position we know it cannot be? So if I guess ""FRAUD"", then A at position3 is going to get a '-'? And that's redundant? And it doesn't test A at position4 or5? Because we are guessing A at3.

So avoid any word that has A at position1 (not allowed), position2 (taken by R), position3 (already known not there). Only positions 4 and 5 are allowed.

Therefore, we must choose words with A at either position4 or position5.

Let's try to think of words ending with ""A"" (position5): _ R _ _ A
Examples:
- ""BARCA"": invalid word? 
- ""PARSA"": obscure?
- ""TOROA"": invalid?
- ""VIRGA"": valid? It's a noun meaning a streak of rain, but uncommon.

Common words: Not many common English words end with A? Except words like ""pizza"" (but we've excluded Z and T? S also excluded?).

What about ""URBAN""? But N is excluded? Discard.

Another: ""ORVAN""? Not a word.

Perhaps not many for position5? So maybe position4 is more promising?

Pattern _ R _ A _
Examples:
- ""BROAD"": as above, valid.
- ""CROAK"": C excluded -> discard.
- ""DROOL"": D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5) -> no A? We need to include A? So we need to have A in position4.

Wait, pattern _ R _ A _ must have A at position4? Then the fifth letter can be anything? So:

""FRAMED""? Too long? 5 letters: FRAME -> 5 letters? But E is excluded? And S? Not.

""GRAMA"": a type of grass? Valid word? GRAMA: G R A M A? But then positions: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5)? Wait, that's A at position3 and position5? We are allowed A at position5? But we cannot have A at position3? So in the pattern we are constructing for a guess? If I guess ""grama"", then position3 is A? Then we get '-' for A at3? But we know that already? That wastes one slot? Then we want the A at position5 to test? 

So ""GRAMA"" would be: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5)
Feedback: 
  Position1: G
  Position2: R (✓)
  Position3: A -> known to be not here? So '-' (redundant)
  Position4: M
  Position5: A -> we are testing if it's at position5? But if the secret word has A only once? Then if the secret word has A at position4 or5? We will get double feedback? 

But we don't know if the word has duplicate A's? So I guess we can try? However, ""GRAMA"" has two A's? 

But let's note: our goal is to test if A is at position5? And if it is, then the fifth letter might be A? Also, we get to test G and M.

Alternatively, I can choose a word without duplicate A? 

What for pattern with A at position4: _ R _ A _ 
We have three positions: letter1, letter3, and letter5 to decide? We need a word? 

Examples: 
- ""BROAD"": B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5) -> no duplicate A? And avoids C,E,N,T,S,Y? Valid letters: B, O, D.

Other options?
- ""FROAD""? Not a word.
- ""PROW A""? Not.
- ""GROAN"": but N excluded -> discard.
- ""GROWL"": no A? Needed.

""WROAD""? Not valid.

So ""BROAD"" seems decent? Or ""DROID"": no A? 

What about ""AVAIL"": but A at1? Not allowed? And position2 must be R? So no.

But ""AVAIL"" doesn't fit the pattern? We are stuck? 

Another idea:  _ R _ A _ 
- ""TRAMP"": has T? T is excluded -> discard.
- ""CRAMP"": C excluded? Also T excluded? 

""GRAPE"": E excluded? 

Another: ""BRAWL"": has A at position3? Not allowed? 

OR: ""PROUD"": no A? 

So it's hard? 

How about A at position5: _ R _ _ A with all new letters?

Words:
- ""VERA5"": not valid.
- ""FURIA"": not common? 
- ""DUCAL"": D(1), U(2), ... but position2 must be R? 

Pattern: letter1, R, letter3, letter4, A.

So that pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] A

Examples:
- ""PARMA"": P(1), R(2), M(3), A(4)? Wait: this has A at position4? But I'm aiming for A at position5? Here position5 is undefined? 

Wait, no: for position5? Then the word must be [ ] R [ ] [ ] A
Then the last letter is A? So:

- ""URBIA"": U(1), R(2), B(3), I(4), A(5) -> valid? But not common? 
- ""ORBIA""? Not a word.

Common words: 
- ""MEDIA"": but E and M? And position2 must be R? So not.

Another: ""India"": I(1), N(2) -> N excluded? And position2 isn't R? 

""AROBA"": A(1) -> but A cannot be at1? So reject? 

Perhaps ""RABAT""? But R at1? 

So a word for _ R _ _ A:
- ""BRADA"" not valid?
- ""CREDA"" not valid?

""GRUDA""? No.

Perhaps I need to consider words that use fewer vowels? Or accept that ""BROAD"" is a valid choice for A at4? 

But ""broad"" uses O and D? We haven't tested O and D? 

Another common word: ""FORAM"" is not common? ""Framed"": 6 letters? 

Perhaps try for a word that tests multiple things? Like ""BRAVA"": B R A V A? Then position3 is A? We know A is not at position3? So that's bad? 

After reconsideration, I think ""BROAD"" is an acceptable choice? Because:
- It has R at2? ✓
- A at position4: we are testing A at a new position? If it's correct? Then position4 is A? If not? Then A must be at5?
- Letters: B, O, D? All new? 

And it avoids the excluded letters? So let me go with that? 

If I guess ""broad"", then the feedback on A at4: if it's '-'? Then A is in the word but not at4? Since we know A is present? Then it must be at position5? Because if it were at any other position? We have excluded positions 1,2,3? So position5 is the only other possibility? 

Similarly, if A gets ✓ at4, then we solved position4? 

So that's good information? 

In fact, if we guess ""broad"", we will definitively place A?

So let me choose ""broad"".

But what about the other positions? We can also test B at1? O at3? D at5? 

So it's a good word? 

Yes.

Therefore, guess: ""broad""

So: <guess>broad</guess>Based on the feedback from both guesses:  
- **Crane feedback**: Eliminates C, N, E; confirms R in position 2 (✓); and shows A exists but not in position 3 (-).  
- **Artsy feedback**: Confirms R again in position 2 (✓); eliminates T, S, Y; and shows A is not in position 1 (-).  

### Deductions:
1. **Pattern**: The word is `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed in position 2).  
2. **A position**: Since A must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1–3 (already tested), it **must** be in position 4 or 5.  
3. **Excluded letters**: C, E, N, T, S, Y cannot appear anywhere.  
4. **Available letters**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W).  

### Optimal Guess: BROAD
- **Why?**  
  - Tests A in **position 4** (since it can't be in 1–3, testing position 4 helps resolve ambiguity—if feedback is ✓, position 4 is solved; if -, A must be in position 5).  
  - Uses new common letters: B (position 1), O (position 3), D (position 5) to maximize information.  
  - Avoids excluded letters and efficiently narrows possibilities.

<guess>broad</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: artsy -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: broad -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(x) A(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have three sets of feedback:

Guess 1: crane
Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word and in position 2.
- A is in the word, but not in position 3 (since it was guessed at position 3).
- C, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: artsy
Feedback: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)
Meaning:
- A is present but not in position 1 (guessed at position 1).
- R is still correct at position 2.
- T, S, Y are not in the word.

Guess 3: broad
Feedback: B(x) R(✓) O(x) A(✓) D(x)
Meaning:
- B, O, D are not in the word (x).
- R is correct at position 2 (✓).
- A is correct at position 4 (✓).

Combining all feedback:

1. The secret word has R in position 2 and A in position 4.
   So the pattern is: _ R _ A _

2. We know the following letters are NOT in the word: C, E, N, T, S, Y, B, O, D.

3. From guess 1, A is present (and now placed at position 4). A was not at position 1 or 3 (confirmed by artsy and crane feedback).

Therefore, the word is: [letter1] R [letter3] A [letter5]

We only need to determine the first, third, and fifth letters? But note: we know letter4 is A? And we have feedback for broad showing A✓ at position4? And we also know that letter2 is R? 

The pattern: position1: ?, position2: R (fixed), position3: ?, position4: A (fixed), position5: ?

And excluded letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y, B, O, D.

The letter3 is unknown? And we know letter3 cannot be O? Also, letter1 cannot be B? And letter5 cannot be D? But also, we must avoid all excluded letters.

So the remaining letters? We have many letters left? Vowels? U, I? Consonants? F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? 

But note: the word must be a valid English word? 

Common letters? 

Also, from the first guess (crane): we had A at position3 which was wrong? But we used crane at position3? Now we know position3 is still unknown? 

However, the excluded letters are listed? 

So possibilities for the missing positions:

Position1: anything except B, C, E, N, T, S, Y? So from the alphabet: A? But A is already used? And we know A? But we can use another A? The secret word might have two A's? It's possible? But from the feedback, we don't know? 

In broad, we guessed A only at position4? And got a check? So that doesn't tell us if the word has another A? But since we haven't guessed A elsewhere? We can consider it? 

But currently, we are missing positions 1,3,5? 

We avoid: B, C, D, E, N, O, T, S, Y? And also? Wait, the excluded letters: 

- From crane: C, N, E
- From artsy: T, S, Y
- From broad: B, O, D

So excluded: B, C, D, E, N, O, T, S, Y.

Thus available letters? A to Z excluding these: A, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But we know the word ends in A? So for position5: it could be any letter? Including A? Or another letter? 

However, position4 is A? So pattern: _ R _ A _ 

Now, we can try to form words? 

For example: 

- U R ? A ? 

Common words? 

Possible words:

- ""URBAN"": but N excluded? 
- ""URVAS""? Not valid? 

Others:

- ""FUGUE""? Not? 

Common words: 

- ""GRAPE"" -> but E excluded and G? And P? Actually: G would be position1? R at2, A at4? So pattern: G R ? A E? But E excluded? 

Perhaps:

- ""GRAMA"" -> but we already excluded letters? And also A at position3? 

How about ""GRIEF""? E excluded? 

Another? ""FRAIL"" -> but A is at position3? Not? Pattern? F R A I L? Then position4 is I? Not A? So not matching? 

But our pattern requires position4 to be A? 

So the word must have exactly the pattern: [1]R[3]A[5]

So the third letter is the tricky one? 

Known words? 

- ""ARIAS""? Not? Pattern: A R I A S? So positions: A at1 and A at4? And S? But S is excluded? 

Excluded letters: S? So discard? 

Another: ""TRIAC""? C excluded? and also T? 

What about ""VIRGA"": but V I R G A? Pattern? V at1, position2 is R? Then I at3? G at4? A at5? But we require position4 to be A? So this: position4 is G, not A? So invalid pattern? 

Our requirement: position4 is A? So the pattern must be: [letter1] R [letter3] A [letter5]

For example: 

- ""IRATE"": I at1, R at2, A at3? But position4 must be A? So pattern: I R A T E? Then position4 is T? Not A? So invalid? 

Actually: if we write the pattern: 
Position1: I? 
Position2: R? 
Position3: A? 
Position4: T? 
Position5: E? 

But we require position4 to be A? So the third position is letter3? And fourth is A? 

Therefore, candidate words: 

- ""KRAAL"": K R A A L? But then position3 is A? But we know A is not in position3? From the first guess? Because ""crane"" had A at position3 and got '-'? Meaning A is in the word but not at position3? 

Therefore, we can't have A at position3? So words with A at position3 are invalid? 

Wait: the pattern we have: position3 is NOT A? Because A is confirmed at position4 and cannot be at position3? So the third letter cannot be A? It must be a different letter? 

Therefore, the pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] A [letter5] where letter3 is NOT A? 

So back to ""KRAAL"": if we guess it? Then pattern: K(1), R(2), A(3) -> but A cannot be at position3? So that would be an error? 

So we need words like:

- ""BREVE"" -> but B,E excluded? 
- ""CREPE"" -> C excluded? 

How about:

- ""PRIMA"": P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5) -> ah! But now we know position4 is A? So pattern: _ R [letter3 not A] A [letter5]? So in ""PRIMA"", if position4 was A? Then it would be: P R I M A? Then position4 is M? Not A? That doesn't work? 

We need position4 to be A? So for example: 

- Let me think of words that end with ... R? A? 

Pattern: X R Y A Z? 

For example: ""BRAVA"" -> B R A V A? Then positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), A(5)? But here position4 is V? Not A? So that doesn't satisfy position4=A? 

We need the fourth letter to be A? So it must be a word that has the form: first letter R second letter third letter? fourth letter is A? fifth letter? 

Valid words: 
- ""FROGS""? Position4? G? 

Another: ""AROMA"": A R O M A? Then position3 is O? Position4 is M? Not A? 

Wait, perhaps: 
- ""ORCGA""? No? 

How about ""UMIAQ"": U R? Not matching? 

Perhaps I'm missing: words like ""QUEEN""? Doesn't fit? 

Another idea: ""AGORA"": A G O R A? Then pattern: A at1, G at2? No R at position2? Not our pattern? 

We need R at position2? 

Let me search mentally: 

- ""CRAWL"" -> C and L? Excluded? 

""PRAWN"": P R A W N? But N excluded? 

""BRAWN"": B and W and N? Excluded? B and N? 

""DRAIN"": D R A I N? N excluded? 

""GRAIN"": G R A I N? N excluded? 

""TRAIT"": T excluded? 

""PRAHU"": P R A H U? Then position3 is A? But we know A cannot be at position3? Also, pattern would be P R A H U? So position4 is H, not A? 

So we need pattern: R followed by ??? but specifically: letter at index0 (1st) any, index1 R, index2 any (not A), index3 A, index4 any? 

So a word:  letter1, R, letter3 (not A), letter4=A, letter5

For example: ""ARTAL"" -> but T? Excluded? and L? 

ARTAL is not common? 

""ARGAL"": T and L? 

How about ""ARVAL""? 6 letters? 

Another: ""MANGA"": M at1? R? Not? 

Perhaps ""ARGON"" -> but O excluded? N excluded? 

Wait: ""ARGOT"": excluded T? 

Perhaps: ""MANIA""? M at1? Then R? Not? 

I'm stuck? Let's try vowel letters? 

For position3, we have: vowels available: I, U, and consonants? 

Words:
- ""PRIZE"" -> Z? But we haven't tested Z? And E excluded? 

""PRIVY"": V? And Y excluded? 

""PRISM"": S excluded? 

""CRIMP"": C excluded? 

""FRAIM""? Not a word? 

Another: ""URAEI""? Not matching? 

Perhaps the word is ""URIAL"": U R I A L? Then: U(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), L(5)? YES! 

Pattern: U R I A L? 

Positions:
  Position1: U
  Position2: R
  Position3: I
  Position4: A
  Position5: L

Now, check against feedback? 

1. U: not tested? 
I: not tested? 
L: not tested? 

Excluded letters? U, I, L are not in the excluded list? 

Available? 

Also, A is at position4? Fixed? 

But is ""URIAL"" a valid English word? It is: a type of wild sheep? Or goat? 

Yes, it is acceptable? 

But let me check? 

In the first guess, ""crane"": we had A at position3? And got '-'? Which means A is in the word but not at position3? And ""URIAL"" has A at position4? So that's consistent? 

In guess2: ""artsy"": we had A not at position1? Correct? 

In guess3: ""broad"": B at1? Excluded? R at2✓? O at3 excluded? A at4✓? D at5 excluded? 

So ""URIAL"" hasn't been ruled out? 

But we also have position3: I? Which is unknown? 

Are there any other words? 

Another possibility: ""ORCAS""? No, O excluded? 

""UNICA"": U N I C A? But N and C excluded? 

""VIGIA"": V I G I A? Pattern: V(1), I(2)? Not R? 

So ""URIAL"" seems a candidate? 

Another candidate? ""JUMAR""? J R? No? 

""QUART"": Q U A R T? Then pattern: Q U A R T? Position2 is A? Not R? 

No? 

How about ""KRIAS""? K R I A S? But S excluded? 

""FLORA"": F L O R A? Then position2 is L? Not R? 

""GRASS""? G R A S S? Then position4 is S? Not A? And S excluded? 

Perhaps ""GRAFT"": G R A F T? Then position3 is A? But A cannot be at position3? 

Therefore, ""URIAL"" is a good candidate? 

But I also think of ""MERMA""? But E excluded? 

Perhaps ""HORAH""? O excluded? 

So for now, I guess ""URIAL"" 

But wait: We haven't used letters in position3? 

Other possibilities? 

""VIRGA"": we thought earlier? But pattern: V I R G A? Then position2 is I? Not R? 

So no? 

Therefore, ""URIAL"" seems the only common word I can think of? 

If the word is ""URIAL"", then:

Guess4: U R I A L

But let me confirm: 
Letters: U, R, I, A, L
Excluded: B,C,D,E,N,O,T,S,Y are excluded? U not excluded? R is allowed? I? L? A is used? 

Position4 is A? Confirmed? 

Position3: we don't know? But if we get it, then we can see? 

But I also must consider: the word might have duplicate A? For example: ""ARAQU""? Not valid.

So I will go with ""URIAL"".

Alternatively: ""PRIMI"" doesn't fit? 

Therefore, <guess>urial</guess> 

But note: I think of ""FRIED"" but E excluded? 

So I say: 

Guess4: urial### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyzing Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
     - C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
     → R is in position 2 (fixed).  
     → A is in the word but not in position 3.  
     → C, N, E are absent.  
   - **Guess 2 (artsy)**:  
     - A(-), R(✓), T(x), S(x), Y(x)  
     → A is not in position 1.  
     → T, S, Y are absent.  
     → Combined with Guess 1, A cannot be in positions 1, 2 (R's spot), or 3 → A must be in position 4 or 5.  
   - **Guess 3 (broad)**:  
     - B(x), R(✓), O(x), A(✓), D(x)  
     → A is fixed in position 4 (✓).  
     → B, O, D are absent.  
     → Resolves A's position: now fixed at position 4.  

2. **Current Word Pattern**:  
   - Pattern: _ R _ A _  
   - Position 2 = R, Position 4 = A (both fixed).  
   - Positions to guess: 1, 3, 5 (letter3 cannot be A, as per Guess 1 feedback).  

3. **Excluded Letters**:  
   All absent letters from feedback: B, C, D, E, N, O, T, S, Y (so 9 letters excluded).  
   - Available vowels: I, U (since A is placed).  
   - Available consonants: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  

4. **Deducing Possible Words**:  
   - Words must fit the pattern _ R _ A _ and use available letters.  
   - Examples considered:  
     - ""URIAL"": U(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), L(5) → Fits pattern and rules:  
       - U, I, L not excluded.  
       - Letter3 = I (not A, as required).  
     - ""URIAL"" is a valid English word (a type of wild sheep).  
   - Eliminated alternatives:  
     - ""KRAAL"" → Invalid: letter3 = A (disallowed from Guess 1).  
     - ""ORCAS""/""AROMA""/""BRAVA"" → Invalid: O/S/B excluded or pattern mismatch.  
     - ""PRIMA""/""CRIMP"" → Invalid: S/O/C excluded or position 4 ≠ A.  
     - ""FRAUD""/""BROAD"" → Invalid: D/B excluded or already guessed.  

5. **Why ""URIAL""?**  
   - Tests position 3 (I) and positions 1/5 (U/L) with common available letters.  
   - Resolves uncertainty: If ✓ for U/I/L, positions are validated; if not, narrows remaining letters.  
   - Only 3 letters left to confirm (U, I, L), maximizing information with unknown but plausible letters.

So the second letter of the secret word is R.\n - A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it\'s present, but not in the first position? Note: our guess had A in position 3 because C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)). Therefore, A is somewhere in the word but not in position 3.\n - C, N, and E are not in the word at all.\n\n So the secret word has:\n   Position 2: R\n   Contains A, but not at position 3.\n   Does not contain C, N, E.\n\n Therefore, the word is of the form: _ R _ _ _\n\n Since A is not at position 3 and also not at position 2 (which is R), it must be at position 1, 4, or 5.\n\n But note: we also know A cannot be at position 1? Why? Because we don\'t have information about position 1 yet. Actually, it could be at position 1, 4, or 5.\n\n We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n We know we cannot use C, N, E again. We must use A again, and we know R is fixed at position 2.\n\n For our next guess, we want to maximize the information. We should try to test common letters and also try to place A in possible positions.\n\n Since A is known to be in the word but not at position 3, let\'s try to put A in a different position to see if it fits.\n\n Also, we need to avoid the letters C, N, E.\n\n Possibilities for A: position 1, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me think of words that have R as the second letter, contain A, and do not contain C, N, E.\n\n Some common words: \n   We can try ""PARTY"" -> but we are avoiding the letter E? Wait, E is out, but T and Y are new.\n\n However, note: we have limited knowledge. Another idea: we could try a word that uses other common vowels and consonants.\n\n But we also know that the word doesn\'t contain E, so vowels we can use are: A (we know), and others like I, O, U.\n\n Also, we haven\'t tried letters like T, S, L, etc.\n\n Let me think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and include A (somewhere but position 3) and exclude C, N, E.\n\n Examples:\n   BRAVO? -> But we have O, which we haven\'t tested. Also, we have B and V. And A would be at position 3? Wait, position 3 is the third letter -> BRAVO: B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), O(5). But our feedback said A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback for our guess ""crane"" had A at position 3 and said A(-) meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So putting A at position 3 in a new guess would be inconsistent? Actually, in the new guess we can put it anywhere because we are testing. But note: we know that if we put A at position 3 in a new guess and it turns out to be correct, then we might misinterpret the feedback? Actually, the feedback will tell us if the letter is correct.\n\n However, let\'s recall the rules: the feedback is absolute. If we guess a word with A at position 3, and if the secret word has A at a different position (not 3) then we will get a \'-\' because A exists but in wrong place. And if the secret word does not have A at all? But we know from the first guess that A is present.\n\n So, to test position 3 again for A? Actually, we know it\'s not at position 3 from the first feedback? How? The first guess has A at position 3 and the feedback was \'-\' meaning the A is present but not at position 3. Therefore, regardless of what we do, the secret word does not have A at position 3.\n\n Therefore, if we guess ""BRAVO"":\n   A is again at position 3? Then the feedback for A must be \'-\' (since we know A isn\'t at position 3) but that wouldn\'t tell us anything new. So we don\'t want to put A in position 3 again.\n\n Instead, we should try to place A in a new position: either 1, 4, or 5.\n\n Consider: \n   Position 1: such as ""TRACK"" -> but invalid because of C and we don\'t use E? But C is excluded so we cannot use it? And ""TRACK"" contains C -> discard.\n\n   How about ""BROAD""? \n      Position 1: B, 2: R, 3: O, 4: A, 5: D.\n      This has A at position 4, which is allowed. And letters: B, R, O, A, D -> none of C, N, E.\n\n   Or ""DRAIN""? But N is excluded -> discard.\n\n   Or ""GRAPE""? E is excluded -> discard.\n\n   Or ""TRAIL"": \n      Position 1: T, 2: R, 3: A -> but A cannot be at position 3? Then we know that if we guess TRAIL and A is at 3, it will be marked \'-\' because we know A is not at 3. So that would waste a slot? We want to test other positions.\n\n   Therefore, let\'s avoid putting A at position 3. Instead, let me try:\n\n   Option: ""PARTY"": \n      P(1), A(2) -> Wait, position 2 is R? So we cannot put A at position 2 because position 2 is R. \n      Correction: The word must have R at position 2. So ""PARTY"" would be: P(1), A(2)? -> No, that\'s conflict because position 2 must be R.\n\n   So we can\'t put A at position 2 because that position is fixed as R.\n\n   Therefore, A can only be at position 1, 4, or 5? Actually, position 1, 4, or 5.\n\n   Example words with R as the second letter and A at position 1: \n      ""ARISE"": But E is excluded -> discard.\n      ""AROMA"": M is new? And O at 4? -> A(1), R(2), O(3), M(4), A(5) -> but we have two A\'s? And also, we don\'t know about O and M.\n\n   But note: the word might have duplicates? The rules don\'t forbid duplicates? Actually, in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? However, the example given does not have duplicates. But let\'s stick to words that haven\'t been excluded.\n\n   ""BRAVE"": but E is excluded -> discard.\n\n   ""CRATE"": has C and E -> discard.\n\n   ""DRAMA"": D(1), R(2), A(3) -> but we know A cannot be at position 3? So then A(3) would be wrong? Also, duplicate A? \n        We don\'t know if the word has duplicates. But if we guess ""drama"", then the A at position 3 would be marked \'-\' (if present elsewhere) and the A at position 5 might be marked appropriately.\n\n   However, a better idea: let\'s choose a word that avoids reused letters and tests new letters.\n\n   Another word: ""PARTS"": P(1), A(2) -> wait, second letter must be R? So we need: _ R _ _ _\n        So we cannot have A at the second letter? Because the second letter is R.\n\n   Correct: the word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n\n   So we can have A at position1: A R _ _ _ \n        Example: ""ARTIC"" -> has C? Discard.\n        ""ARDOR"": has O and R again? Also duplicates? And we don\'t know about O and D.\n\n   Position4: _ R _ A _\n        Example: ""TRUAD""? Not a word. \n        ""GRAND"": but N excluded -> discard.\n        ""WROAD""? Not a word.\n\n   Position5: _ R _ _ A\n        Example: ""BARCA""? Not a word.\n        ""FORMA""? But M and F? And O? \n        ""PRIMA"": P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5) -> this is valid.\n\n   So let\'s consider ""PRIMA"": \n        Letters: P, R, I, M, A -> all new except R and A (and A we know is present). Also avoids C, E, N.\n\n   However, we are not sure if A is at position5? But this guess tests that.\n\n   If we guess ""PRIMA"":\n      If the secret word has A at position5, we might get a check for A? But the feedback will tell.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position1: ""ARTSY"" -> T, S, Y? But R must be at position2? That word: A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4), Y(5). That works. And letters: A,R,T,S,Y -> no C, E, N.\n\n   So compare ""ARTSY"" and ""PRIMA"".\n\n   Both seem valid. Which one gives more information?\n\n   ""ARTSY"" tests: \n      Position1: A -> we know A is present, so if it gets ✓ then good, but if it gets \'-\' then we know A is at position4 or 5? Actually, if it gets ✓ then A is at 1? Then we solved position1. But if it gets \'-\' that means A is in the word but not at position1? Then since we know it\'s not at 3, it must be at 4 or 5.\n\n   Also, ""ARTSY"" tests T at position3, S at position4, Y at position5.\n\n   Similarly, ""PRIMA"" tests P at position1, I at position3, M at position4, A at position5.\n\n   Both words are valid.\n\n   But note: in ""ARTSY"", we are using S and T which are common letters.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use ""TRAWL"": \n        T(1), R(2), A(3), W(4), L(5) -> but A would be at position3? And we know A isn\'t at position3? So then the A in position3 would be marked as \'-\'? That would be redundant? Because we already know A isn\'t at position3. So it would waste one slot? Then we only get new information for T, W, L.\n\n   Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position3.\n\n   So between ""ARTSY"" and ""PRIMA"", I think ""ARTSY"" is better because it uses very common letters: T, S, and Y.\n\n   Also, it avoids repeating a position we know A doesn\'t go? Because A is at position1? \n\n   Moreover, if the word does not have A at position1 and we get a feedback of \'-\' for A, then we know A must be at 4 or 5.\n\n   So I will go with ""ARTSY"".\n\n   But note: we have used the letter R again? We know it\'s correct at position2, so we don\'t need to change that.\n\n   So let\'s guess ""ARTSY"".\n\n   But wait: the feedback for the first guess indicated that A is in the word. If we put A at a new position (position1), what if the secret word has A at position4 or 5? Then we get A at position1 marked as \'-\', meaning that A is present but not at 1, but we don\'t know which one? And we also are testing T, S, Y.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try ""PURDA"" or ""WORDY"", but I think ""ARTSY"" is a good choice.\n\n   Another word: ""TARES"", but E is excluded -> discard.\n\n   So I will go with ""ARTSY"".\n\n   Steps:\n      Guess 2: ""ARTSY""\n\n   But let me double-check: \n      Position 1: A -> we know A is present, so if it\'s not at 3, it might be at 1? We are testing.\n      Position 2: R -> already known to be correct, so ✓ expected? Actually, in the feedback, we hope to get R(✓) at position2.\n      Position 3: T -> unknown\n      Position 4: S -> unknown\n      Position 5: Y -> unknown\n\n   We avoid C, E, N.\n\n   So let\'s output ""ARTSY"".\n\n   Alternatively, if we want to test multiple possibilities at once? We know that A must be at 1,4, or 5? What word could test A at 1 and also at 4 and 5? But that is impossible. So we choose a position to test.\n\n   Also, note that the secret word might have two A\'s? It\'s possible? But since we haven\'t encountered any duplicate feedback? We don\'t know. But we will see.\n\n   I think ""ARTSY"" is a reasonable choice.\n\n<guess>artsy</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is confirmed in the second position (✓).\n- A is present in the secret word but not in the third position (-).\n- C, N, and E are absent from the word (x).\n\nThe secret word adheres to the pattern: _ R _ _ _ (where the second letter is R). The letter A must appear in either position 1, 4, or 5, since it cannot be in positions 2 (occupied by R) or 3 (confirmed by the first feedback). Letters C, N, and E are excluded.\n\nFor the next guess, I chose ""artsy"" for the following reasons:\n- It keeps R in position 2 (already confirmed).\n- It tests A in position 1, which is one of the possible positions for A (if A is in position 1, we\'ll get ✓; if not, we\'ll get - and know A must be in position 4 or 5).\n- It introduces new common consonants (T in position 3, S in position 4, Y in position 5) to maximize information.\n- It avoids excluded letters (C, N, E).\n\n<guess>artsy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: artsy -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nFirst guess: crane\nFeedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the word and in position 2 (correct).\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and got ""-"").\n- C, N, E are not in the word.\n\nSecond guess: artsy\nFeedback: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is again confirmed in position 2 (✓).\n- A is present (we knew that) but NOT in position 1 (since we guessed it in position 1 and got ""-"").\n- T, S, Y are not in the word.\n\nCombining information:\n\n- The word has R in position 2.\n- The letter A is in the word but not in positions 1, 2 (position 2 is R), or 3. Therefore, A must be in position 4 or 5.\n\n- Excluded letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y (from the feedback x\'s).\n- Letters we know are in the word: A (somewhere) and R (at position 2). Additionally, from the first guess, we also inferred A is present.\n\nSo the word pattern is: _ R _ _ _ \nWe know the word must contain A in either the 4th or 5th position.\n\nAvailable letters: We must avoid C, E, N, T, S, Y. So we have other letters to use.\n\nGiven that A is in position 4 or 5, we need to choose a word that:\n1. Has R at position 2.\n2. Contains A in either position 4 or 5 (we need to test which one).\n3. Uses letters that are not excluded and can help identify other letters.\n\nPotential letters: We haven\'t tested many vowels or consonants. Vowels available: O, I, U (since A is already present, but there might be more vowels). Consonants: many available such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Z.\n\nSince A is constrained to positions 4 or 5, I can make two different guesses to test these, but ideally, I\'d like to test both possibilities in one guess? That might be hard.\n\nAlternatively, I can choose a word that has A in position 4 and then another word for position 5? But I want to gain more information about other positions.\n\nIdea: guess a word that has A in position 4 and uses new common letters to test other positions.\n\nExample words with A at position 4 and pattern _ R _ A _ :\n\n- ""BROAD"": But O and D? And we haven\'t excluded O or D. However, let me check the letters: B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5). This uses O and D. But ""broad"" is a valid word.\n\nBut let me see if A is at position 5: pattern _ R _ _ A \n- ""FRIDA"": Not a word.\n- ""GRAMA"": Valid? Actually, ""gamma"" has two M\'s but that\'s different. ""GRAVA""? Not valid.\n\nAnother word for _ R _ A _ : \n- ""DROPA""? Not a word.\n- ""GROMA""? Not a word.\n- ""PROVA""? Not a word.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""FORAM""? Not common.\n\nAnother idea: ""ARMOR"" but then A is at position1? But we know position1 doesn\'t have A? And armor: A1, R2, M3, O4, R5. Also duplicate R? And position4 is O? Then A at position1? But feedback said A not at position1? So ""armor"" wouldn\'t be valid? Moreover, A is only allowed at 4 or 5? So it has to be at 4 or 5? So ""armor"" is invalid because A is at1.\n\nHow about ""WROAD""? Not a word.\n\nWhat about ""BREAD""? But E is excluded? Discard.\n\n""FRAUD"": \n  F(1), R(2), A(3) -> wait, A cannot be at position3? But our guess has A at position3? The pattern: F(1), R(2), A(3), U(4), D(5). But we know A is not at position3? So this is invalid? Because we are putting A in a position we know it cannot be? So if I guess ""FRAUD"", then A at position3 is going to get a \'-\'? And that\'s redundant? And it doesn\'t test A at position4 or5? Because we are guessing A at3.\n\nSo avoid any word that has A at position1 (not allowed), position2 (taken by R), position3 (already known not there). Only positions 4 and 5 are allowed.\n\nTherefore, we must choose words with A at either position4 or position5.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words ending with ""A"" (position5): _ R _ _ A\nExamples:\n- ""BARCA"": invalid word? \n- ""PARSA"": obscure?\n- ""TOROA"": invalid?\n- ""VIRGA"": valid? It\'s a noun meaning a streak of rain, but uncommon.\n\nCommon words: Not many common English words end with A? Except words like ""pizza"" (but we\'ve excluded Z and T? S also excluded?).\n\nWhat about ""URBAN""? But N is excluded? Discard.\n\nAnother: ""ORVAN""? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps not many for position5? So maybe position4 is more promising?\n\nPattern _ R _ A _\nExamples:\n- ""BROAD"": as above, valid.\n- ""CROAK"": C excluded -> discard.\n- ""DROOL"": D(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), L(5) -> no A? We need to include A? So we need to have A in position4.\n\nWait, pattern _ R _ A _ must have A at position4? Then the fifth letter can be anything? So:\n\n""FRAMED""? Too long? 5 letters: FRAME -> 5 letters? But E is excluded? And S? Not.\n\n""GRAMA"": a type of grass? Valid word? GRAMA: G R A M A? But then positions: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5)? Wait, that\'s A at position3 and position5? We are allowed A at position5? But we cannot have A at position3? So in the pattern we are constructing for a guess? If I guess ""grama"", then position3 is A? Then we get \'-\' for A at3? But we know that already? That wastes one slot? Then we want the A at position5 to test? \n\nSo ""GRAMA"" would be: G(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5)\nFeedback: \n  Position1: G\n  Position2: R (✓)\n  Position3: A -> known to be not here? So \'-\' (redundant)\n  Position4: M\n  Position5: A -> we are testing if it\'s at position5? But if the secret word has A only once? Then if the secret word has A at position4 or5? We will get double feedback? \n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has duplicate A\'s? So I guess we can try? However, ""GRAMA"" has two A\'s? \n\nBut let\'s note: our goal is to test if A is at position5? And if it is, then the fifth letter might be A? Also, we get to test G and M.\n\nAlternatively, I can choose a word without duplicate A? \n\nWhat for pattern with A at position4: _ R _ A _ \nWe have three positions: letter1, letter3, and letter5 to decide? We need a word? \n\nExamples: \n- ""BROAD"": B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5) -> no duplicate A? And avoids C,E,N,T,S,Y? Valid letters: B, O, D.\n\nOther options?\n- ""FROAD""? Not a word.\n- ""PROW A""? Not.\n- ""GROAN"": but N excluded -> discard.\n- ""GROWL"": no A? Needed.\n\n""WROAD""? Not valid.\n\nSo ""BROAD"" seems decent? Or ""DROID"": no A? \n\nWhat about ""AVAIL"": but A at1? Not allowed? And position2 must be R? So no.\n\nBut ""AVAIL"" doesn\'t fit the pattern? We are stuck? \n\nAnother idea:  _ R _ A _ \n- ""TRAMP"": has T? T is excluded -> discard.\n- ""CRAMP"": C excluded? Also T excluded? \n\n""GRAPE"": E excluded? \n\nAnother: ""BRAWL"": has A at position3? Not allowed? \n\nOR: ""PROUD"": no A? \n\nSo it\'s hard? \n\nHow about A at position5: _ R _ _ A with all new letters?\n\nWords:\n- ""VERA5"": not valid.\n- ""FURIA"": not common? \n- ""DUCAL"": D(1), U(2), ... but position2 must be R? \n\nPattern: letter1, R, letter3, letter4, A.\n\nSo that pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] A\n\nExamples:\n- ""PARMA"": P(1), R(2), M(3), A(4)? Wait: this has A at position4? But I\'m aiming for A at position5? Here position5 is undefined? \n\nWait, no: for position5? Then the word must be [ ] R [ ] [ ] A\nThen the last letter is A? So:\n\n- ""URBIA"": U(1), R(2), B(3), I(4), A(5) -> valid? But not common? \n- ""ORBIA""? Not a word.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""MEDIA"": but E and M? And position2 must be R? So not.\n\nAnother: ""India"": I(1), N(2) -> N excluded? And position2 isn\'t R? \n\n""AROBA"": A(1) -> but A cannot be at1? So reject? \n\nPerhaps ""RABAT""? But R at1? \n\nSo a word for _ R _ _ A:\n- ""BRADA"" not valid?\n- ""CREDA"" not valid?\n\n""GRUDA""? No.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider words that use fewer vowels? Or accept that ""BROAD"" is a valid choice for A at4? \n\nBut ""broad"" uses O and D? We haven\'t tested O and D? \n\nAnother common word: ""FORAM"" is not common? ""Framed"": 6 letters? \n\nPerhaps try for a word that tests multiple things? Like ""BRAVA"": B R A V A? Then position3 is A? We know A is not at position3? So that\'s bad? \n\nAfter reconsideration, I think ""BROAD"" is an acceptable choice? Because:\n- It has R at2? ✓\n- A at position4: we are testing A at a new position? If it\'s correct? Then position4 is A? If not? Then A must be at5?\n- Letters: B, O, D? All new? \n\nAnd it avoids the excluded letters? So let me go with that? \n\nIf I guess ""broad"", then the feedback on A at4: if it\'s \'-\'? Then A is in the word but not at4? Since we know A is present? Then it must be at position5? Because if it were at any other position? We have excluded positions 1,2,3? So position5 is the only other possibility? \n\nSimilarly, if A gets ✓ at4, then we solved position4? \n\nSo that\'s good information? \n\nIn fact, if we guess ""broad"", we will definitively place A?\n\nSo let me choose ""broad"".\n\nBut what about the other positions? We can also test B at1? O at3? D at5? \n\nSo it\'s a good word? \n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, guess: ""broad""\n\nSo: <guess>broad</guess>Based on the feedback from both guesses:  \n- **Crane feedback**: Eliminates C, N, E; confirms R in position 2 (✓); and shows A exists but not in position 3 (-).  \n- **Artsy feedback**: Confirms R again in position 2 (✓); eliminates T, S, Y; and shows A is not in position 1 (-).  \n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Pattern**: The word is `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed in position 2).  \n2. **A position**: Since A must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1–3 (already tested), it **must** be in position 4 or 5.  \n3. **Excluded letters**: C, E, N, T, S, Y cannot appear anywhere.  \n4. **Available letters**: Focus on untested common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W).  \n\n### Optimal Guess: BROAD\n- **Why?**  \n  - Tests A in **position 4** (since it can\'t be in 1–3, testing position 4 helps resolve ambiguity—if feedback is ✓, position 4 is solved; if -, A must be in position 5).  \n  - Uses new common letters: B (position 1), O (position 3), D (position 5) to maximize information.  \n  - Avoids excluded letters and efficiently narrows possibilities.\n\n<guess>broad</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: artsy -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: broad -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(x) A(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have three sets of feedback:\n\nGuess 1: crane\nFeedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the word and in position 2.\n- A is in the word, but not in position 3 (since it was guessed at position 3).\n- C, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: artsy\nFeedback: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is present but not in position 1 (guessed at position 1).\n- R is still correct at position 2.\n- T, S, Y are not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: broad\nFeedback: B(x) R(✓) O(x) A(✓) D(x)\nMeaning:\n- B, O, D are not in the word (x).\n- R is correct at position 2 (✓).\n- A is correct at position 4 (✓).\n\nCombining all feedback:\n\n1. The secret word has R in position 2 and A in position 4.\n   So the pattern is: _ R _ A _\n\n2. We know the following letters are NOT in the word: C, E, N, T, S, Y, B, O, D.\n\n3. From guess 1, A is present (and now placed at position 4). A was not at position 1 or 3 (confirmed by artsy and crane feedback).\n\nTherefore, the word is: [letter1] R [letter3] A [letter5]\n\nWe only need to determine the first, third, and fifth letters? But note: we know letter4 is A? And we have feedback for broad showing A✓ at position4? And we also know that letter2 is R? \n\nThe pattern: position1: ?, position2: R (fixed), position3: ?, position4: A (fixed), position5: ?\n\nAnd excluded letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y, B, O, D.\n\nThe letter3 is unknown? And we know letter3 cannot be O? Also, letter1 cannot be B? And letter5 cannot be D? But also, we must avoid all excluded letters.\n\nSo the remaining letters? We have many letters left? Vowels? U, I? Consonants? F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? \n\nBut note: the word must be a valid English word? \n\nCommon letters? \n\nAlso, from the first guess (crane): we had A at position3 which was wrong? But we used crane at position3? Now we know position3 is still unknown? \n\nHowever, the excluded letters are listed? \n\nSo possibilities for the missing positions:\n\nPosition1: anything except B, C, E, N, T, S, Y? So from the alphabet: A? But A is already used? And we know A? But we can use another A? The secret word might have two A\'s? It\'s possible? But from the feedback, we don\'t know? \n\nIn broad, we guessed A only at position4? And got a check? So that doesn\'t tell us if the word has another A? But since we haven\'t guessed A elsewhere? We can consider it? \n\nBut currently, we are missing positions 1,3,5? \n\nWe avoid: B, C, D, E, N, O, T, S, Y? And also? Wait, the excluded letters: \n\n- From crane: C, N, E\n- From artsy: T, S, Y\n- From broad: B, O, D\n\nSo excluded: B, C, D, E, N, O, T, S, Y.\n\nThus available letters? A to Z excluding these: A, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nBut we know the word ends in A? So for position5: it could be any letter? Including A? Or another letter? \n\nHowever, position4 is A? So pattern: _ R _ A _ \n\nNow, we can try to form words? \n\nFor example: \n\n- U R ? A ? \n\nCommon words? \n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""URBAN"": but N excluded? \n- ""URVAS""? Not valid? \n\nOthers:\n\n- ""FUGUE""? Not? \n\nCommon words: \n\n- ""GRAPE"" -> but E excluded and G? And P? Actually: G would be position1? R at2, A at4? So pattern: G R ? A E? But E excluded? \n\nPerhaps:\n\n- ""GRAMA"" -> but we already excluded letters? And also A at position3? \n\nHow about ""GRIEF""? E excluded? \n\nAnother? ""FRAIL"" -> but A is at position3? Not? Pattern? F R A I L? Then position4 is I? Not A? So not matching? \n\nBut our pattern requires position4 to be A? \n\nSo the word must have exactly the pattern: [1]R[3]A[5]\n\nSo the third letter is the tricky one? \n\nKnown words? \n\n- ""ARIAS""? Not? Pattern: A R I A S? So positions: A at1 and A at4? And S? But S is excluded? \n\nExcluded letters: S? So discard? \n\nAnother: ""TRIAC""? C excluded? and also T? \n\nWhat about ""VIRGA"": but V I R G A? Pattern? V at1, position2 is R? Then I at3? G at4? A at5? But we require position4 to be A? So this: position4 is G, not A? So invalid pattern? \n\nOur requirement: position4 is A? So the pattern must be: [letter1] R [letter3] A [letter5]\n\nFor example: \n\n- ""IRATE"": I at1, R at2, A at3? But position4 must be A? So pattern: I R A T E? Then position4 is T? Not A? So invalid? \n\nActually: if we write the pattern: \nPosition1: I? \nPosition2: R? \nPosition3: A? \nPosition4: T? \nPosition5: E? \n\nBut we require position4 to be A? So the third position is letter3? And fourth is A? \n\nTherefore, candidate words: \n\n- ""KRAAL"": K R A A L? But then position3 is A? But we know A is not in position3? From the first guess? Because ""crane"" had A at position3 and got \'-\'? Meaning A is in the word but not at position3? \n\nTherefore, we can\'t have A at position3? So words with A at position3 are invalid? \n\nWait: the pattern we have: position3 is NOT A? Because A is confirmed at position4 and cannot be at position3? So the third letter cannot be A? It must be a different letter? \n\nTherefore, the pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] A [letter5] where letter3 is NOT A? \n\nSo back to ""KRAAL"": if we guess it? Then pattern: K(1), R(2), A(3) -> but A cannot be at position3? So that would be an error? \n\nSo we need words like:\n\n- ""BREVE"" -> but B,E excluded? \n- ""CREPE"" -> C excluded? \n\nHow about:\n\n- ""PRIMA"": P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), A(5) -> ah! But now we know position4 is A? So pattern: _ R [letter3 not A] A [letter5]? So in ""PRIMA"", if position4 was A? Then it would be: P R I M A? Then position4 is M? Not A? That doesn\'t work? \n\nWe need position4 to be A? So for example: \n\n- Let me think of words that end with ... R? A? \n\nPattern: X R Y A Z? \n\nFor example: ""BRAVA"" -> B R A V A? Then positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), A(5)? But here position4 is V? Not A? So that doesn\'t satisfy position4=A? \n\nWe need the fourth letter to be A? So it must be a word that has the form: first letter R second letter third letter? fourth letter is A? fifth letter? \n\nValid words: \n- ""FROGS""? Position4? G? \n\nAnother: ""AROMA"": A R O M A? Then position3 is O? Position4 is M? Not A? \n\nWait, perhaps: \n- ""ORCGA""? No? \n\nHow about ""UMIAQ"": U R? Not matching? \n\nPerhaps I\'m missing: words like ""QUEEN""? Doesn\'t fit? \n\nAnother idea: ""AGORA"": A G O R A? Then pattern: A at1, G at2? No R at position2? Not our pattern? \n\nWe need R at position2? \n\nLet me search mentally: \n\n- ""CRAWL"" -> C and L? Excluded? \n\n""PRAWN"": P R A W N? But N excluded? \n\n""BRAWN"": B and W and N? Excluded? B and N? \n\n""DRAIN"": D R A I N? N excluded? \n\n""GRAIN"": G R A I N? N excluded? \n\n""TRAIT"": T excluded? \n\n""PRAHU"": P R A H U? Then position3 is A? But we know A cannot be at position3? Also, pattern would be P R A H U? So position4 is H, not A? \n\nSo we need pattern: R followed by ??? but specifically: letter at index0 (1st) any, index1 R, index2 any (not A), index3 A, index4 any? \n\nSo a word:  letter1, R, letter3 (not A), letter4=A, letter5\n\nFor example: ""ARTAL"" -> but T? Excluded? and L? \n\nARTAL is not common? \n\n""ARGAL"": T and L? \n\nHow about ""ARVAL""? 6 letters? \n\nAnother: ""MANGA"": M at1? R? Not? \n\nPerhaps ""ARGON"" -> but O excluded? N excluded? \n\nWait: ""ARGOT"": excluded T? \n\nPerhaps: ""MANIA""? M at1? Then R? Not? \n\nI\'m stuck? Let\'s try vowel letters? \n\nFor position3, we have: vowels available: I, U, and consonants? \n\nWords:\n- ""PRIZE"" -> Z? But we haven\'t tested Z? And E excluded? \n\n""PRIVY"": V? And Y excluded? \n\n""PRISM"": S excluded? \n\n""CRIMP"": C excluded? \n\n""FRAIM""? Not a word? \n\nAnother: ""URAEI""? Not matching? \n\nPerhaps the word is ""URIAL"": U R I A L? Then: U(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), L(5)? YES! \n\nPattern: U R I A L? \n\nPositions:\n  Position1: U\n  Position2: R\n  Position3: I\n  Position4: A\n  Position5: L\n\nNow, check against feedback? \n\n1. U: not tested? \nI: not tested? \nL: not tested? \n\nExcluded letters? U, I, L are not in the excluded list? \n\nAvailable? \n\nAlso, A is at position4? Fixed? \n\nBut is ""URIAL"" a valid English word? It is: a type of wild sheep? Or goat? \n\nYes, it is acceptable? \n\nBut let me check? \n\nIn the first guess, ""crane"": we had A at position3?

We have the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane
Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word and in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- C, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: artsy
Feedback: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)
Meaning:
- A is present but not in position 1.
- R is still in position 2 (confirmed).
- T, S, Y are not in the word.

Guess 3: broad
Feedback: B(x) R(✓) O(x) A(✓) D(x)
Meaning:
- R is in position 2 (confirmed).
- A is in the word and in position 4 (correct position).
- B, O, D are not in the word.

Guess 4: urial
Feedback: U(x) R(✓) I(✓) A(✓) L(x)
Meaning:
- R is in position 2 (confirmed).
- I is in the word and in position 3 (because we guessed I at position 3 and got a check).
- A is in position 4 (confirmed).
- U and L are not in the word.

Now, combining all feedback:

- The word has R in position 2, I in position 3, and A in position 4.
- So the pattern is: _ R I A _ 

- Excluded letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y, B, O, D, U, L (from all x's)

- We know the word must be of the form: [letter1] R I A [letter5]

- Available letters: We must avoid the excluded letters. The excluded letters are: B, C, D, E, L, N, O, S, T, U, Y.

- The remaining letters are: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and note that A, R, I are already placed, so they can be reused? But we don't know if the word has duplicates. However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far, so we assume no duplicates? But we should not rule out duplicates? However, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But in this case, we are missing two positions, and we have no indication of duplicates yet.

But note: we have placed three distinct letters: R, I, A. The word might have five distinct letters? Or it might have duplicates? We don't know.

However, the missing letters are position1 and position5. We need to choose two letters from the available set: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ R I A _ :

- Let's think of common words:
  - ""TRIAL"": but T is excluded? (from guess2: T(x)) -> invalid.
  - ""FRIAR"": F R I A R -> but R is repeated? And the last letter is R. But we have R at position2? So if we have R at position5? That would be a duplicate? And we haven't tested for duplicates? Also, F is available? But let's see: F(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), R(5). Then the feedback for position5: if we guess R, and the word has R at position2, then if there is another R? It would be marked as '-'? But in our feedback for guess4, we had R at position2 and it was marked ✓, but we didn't have R elsewhere? So we don't know? But in this case, we are guessing R at position5? It might be marked as '-' if present? Or if not, then x? But we don't know? However, we are trying to solve? 

  But ""FRIAR"" has duplicate R? And we don't know if the word has duplicates? So we can consider? But T is excluded? Wait, ""FRIAR"" doesn't have T? But we have F? 

  However, we are going to guess a word? But we have to avoid excluded letters? F is not excluded? So ""FRIAR"" is a candidate? 

  But let's see the pattern: position5 is R? 

  Alternatively, ""PRIAM"": P R I A M? Then M at position5? 

  ""PRIAM"" is a proper name? But sometimes allowed? 

  ""CRIBS"": C excluded? 

  ""GRIMY"": G R I M Y? But Y excluded? 

  ""WRING"": W R I N G? N excluded? 

  ""PRINT"": P R I N T? N and T excluded? 

  ""FRISK"": F R I S K? S excluded? 

  ""PRIMA"": P R I M A? But then position4 is M? Not A? But we have A fixed at position4? So no? 

  We require position4 to be A? So ""PRIMA"" is P R I M A? Then position4 is M? Not A? So invalid pattern? 

  We need the pattern: [1] R I A [5]

  So the word must have ""RIA"" in positions 2,3,4? 

  So ""FRIAR"": F R I A R -> positions: 1:F, 2:R, 3:I, 4:A, 5:R -> pattern matches? 

  ""PRIAL""? Not a word? 

  ""TRIAC"": T and C excluded? 

  ""BRIAR"": B excluded? 

  ""GRIFF"": G R I F F? Then position4 is F? Not A? 

  ""GRILL"": G R I L L? L excluded? 

  ""KRILL"": K R I L L? L excluded? 

  ""PRIZE"": P R I Z E? E excluded? 

  ""PRIDE"": P R I D E? D and E excluded? 

  ""PRICE"": P R I C E? C and E excluded? 

  ""PRION"": P R I O N? O and N excluded? 

  ""FRIED"": F R I E D? E and D excluded? 

  ""FRUIT"": F R U I T? U and T excluded? 

  ""FROST"": F R O S T? O, S, T excluded? 

  ""CRISP"": C excluded? 

  ""WRITE"": W R I T E? T and E excluded? 

  ""DRIVE"": D excluded? 

  ""GRIPE"": G R I P E? E excluded? 

  ""TRIPE"": T excluded? 

  ""SWIFT"": S, W? But S excluded? 

  So after this, ""FRIAR"" seems a candidate? 

  But we have to check if duplicate R is allowed? The feedback hasn't indicated any duplicate? But we haven't guessed a duplicate? 

  Another candidate: ""PRIAL"" is not a word? 

  ""BRIAS"": B excluded? 

  ""CRIAS"": C excluded? 

  ""GRIAS"": G R I A S? But S excluded? 

  ""KRIAS"": K R I A S? S excluded? 

  ""PRIAS"": P R I A S? S excluded? 

  ""VRIAS"": V R I A S? S excluded? 

  ""ARIAS"": A at position1? But we know A is not at position1? From guess2? And also, S excluded? 

  ""ORIKS""? O excluded? 

  So ""FRIAR"" is the only common word I can think of? 

  But let me confirm: ""FRIAR"" is a valid English word? Yes, meaning a member of a religious order.

  Now, if we guess ""FRIAR"", what feedback do we expect?
  - Position1: F -> if the word has F? We don't know? If it does, then ✓ or -? But we are guessing F at position1? 
  - Position2: R -> ✓ (fixed)
  - Position3: I -> ✓ (fixed)
  - Position4: A -> ✓ (fixed)
  - Position5: R -> if the word has another R? Then it would be marked as '-'? Because the R at position2 is already accounted for? Or if the word has only one R? Then it would be marked as x? 

  But we don't know if the word has duplicate R? 

  Alternatively, if the word is ""FRIAR"", then the secret word has two R's? Then the feedback for position5: R would be marked as '-'? Because it is present but in the wrong position? (since the only correct R is at position2? and position5 is not R? But if there is another R? Then it would be marked as present but wrong position? 

  But in our pattern, we have R at position2? So if the word has R at position5? Then it's a duplicate? 

  However, we don't know? 

  But note: we have only one guess left? Because we have 6 tries? We are on guess 5? 

  We must be careful? 

  Another possibility: ""PRIAM"" (a name) -> P R I A M? Then pattern: P(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), M(5). This fits? And M is available? 

  ""PRIAM"" is a proper name? But sometimes Wordle uses proper names? Or not? Typically, Wordle uses common words? But ""Priam"" is the king of Troy? 

  But let's see: if we avoid proper names? Then ""FRIAR"" is better? 

  Also, ""GRIFF"": doesn't fit? 

  ""QUIFF"": Q U I F F? But position2 is U? Not R? 

  So between ""FRIAR"" and ""PRIAM"", which one? 

  We have not excluded P? So ""PRIAM"" is a candidate? 

  Also, ""FRIAR"" uses F and duplicate R? 

  But we have no evidence against duplicates? 

  However, to maximize information? We might want to avoid duplicates? 

  But we are running out of guesses? 

  Let me list all possible words? 

  Pattern: [F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Z] R I A [F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Z] 

  And the word must be valid? 

  Examples:
  - F R I A F? Not a word? 
  - F R I A R -> ""FRIAR""
  - G R I A G? Not?
  - G R I A L? But L excluded? 
  - H R I A H? Not?
  - H R I A T? T excluded? 
  - J R I A J? Not?
  - K R I A K? Not?
  - M R I A M? ""MRIAM""? Not a word? 
  - P R I A P? ""PRIAP""? Not common? 
  - P R I A M? ""PRIAM"" (proper name)
  - Q R I A Q? Not?
  - V R I A V? Not?
  - W R I A W? Not?
  - X R I A X? Not?
  - Z R I A Z? Not?

  Also, with different letters:
  - F R I A M? ""FRIAM""? Not a word?
  - G R I A F? ""GRIAF""? Not?
  - H R I A M? ""HRIAM""? Not?
  - P R I A F? ""PRIAF""? Not?
  - etc.

  So the only common words are ""FRIAR"" and ""PRIAM"" (if we accept proper names).

  But ""PRIAM"" is not a common noun? 

  Another: ""BRIAR"" is excluded because B is excluded? 

  ""CRIAR""? Not a word? 

  So we have two options: ""FRIAR"" and ""PRIAM"". 

  Since ""FRIAR"" is a common word, I'll go with that? 

  But note: in ""FRIAR"", we are guessing R at position5? And we already have R at position2? So if the word has only one R? Then position5 will be marked as x? And we know the word must have R only at position2? Then we can deduce that the word is not ""FRIAR""? 

  Alternatively, if it is ""FRIAR"", then we get feedback: F(?), R(✓), I(✓), A(✓), R(-) if there is a duplicate? Or if the word has only one R? Then R at position5 would be x? 

  But we know the word has at least one R (at position2)? So if we get R at position5 marked as x? Then the word has no second R? So ""FRIAR"" is wrong? 

  Similarly, if we get R at position5 marked as '-'? Then it is present? So the word has two R's? 

  But we don't know? 

  However, we have to guess? 

  Alternatively, we can guess ""PRIAM"" to avoid the duplicate? 

  But ""PRIAM"" is a proper name? And might not be in the word list? 

  Another word: ""TRIAD"" -> T and D excluded? 

  So I think ""FRIAR"" is the best bet? 

  But let me check the feedback we would get if the word is ""PRIAM"": 
  - P at position1: if present? 
  - R at2: ✓
  - I at3: ✓
  - A at4: ✓
  - M at5: if present? 

  And if the word is ""FRIAR"", we get:
  - F at1: if present?
  - R at2: ✓
  - I at3: ✓
  - A at4: ✓
  - R at5: either - or x? 

  But we don't know? 

  However, we have only one guess left? We are on guess 5? We have 6 tries? So we can try? 

  I think we should go with ""FRIAR"" because it is a common word? 

  But let me see if there is another word? 

  What about ""GRIFF""? No, because position4 must be A? 

  ""WHIFF""? W H I F F? But position2 is H? Not R? 

  So I think ""FRIAR"" is the word? 

  Therefore, I'll guess ""FRIAR"". 

  But note: we have excluded L? And U? So no? 

  So <guess>friar</guess> 

  Alternatively, if we are not sure? We can try a word that uses two new letters? But we have to fill the pattern? 

  But we don't have many options? 

  So I go with ""FRIAR"".
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Pattern Established**:
   - Position 2: **R** (✓ in all guesses).
   - Position 3: **I** (✓ in Guess 4).
   - Position 4: **A** (✓ in Guess 3 and 4).
   - The word pattern is: `_ R I A _`.

2. **Excluded Letters** (from all ❌ feedback):  
   `B, C, D, E, L, N, O, S, T, U, Y`.  
   - **Available letters**: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

3. **Key Insights**:
   - Position 1 and 5 must be filled with letters from the available set.
   - The word must contain **no duplicates** (no feedback indicated duplicates so far).
   - Common words fitting `_ R I A _` are limited due to exclusions (e.g., ""TRIAL"" invalid due to T, ""BRIAR"" invalid due to B).

4. **Top Candidate**: **""FRIAR""**  
   - **Fits the pattern**: `F R I A R`.
   - **Why it works**:
     - Tests **F** (new letter) in position 1.
     - Tests **R** in position 5 (possible duplicate; if present, feedback will clarify).
     - Avoids all excluded letters.
   - **If correct**: Positions 1 (F) and 5 (R) will show ✓ or positional feedback.
   - **If incorrect**: Feedback on F/R will reveal if duplicates exist or narrow options further.

### Next Guess: **FRIAR**
<guess>friar</guess>",friar,"We have the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane
Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word and in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- C, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: artsy
Feedback: A(-) R(✓) T(x) S(x) Y(x)

- A is present but not in position 1.
- R is still in position 2 (confirmed).
- T, S, Y are not in the word.

Guess 3: broad

Meaning:
- R is in position 2 (confirmed).
- A is in the word and in position 4 (correct position).
- B, O, D are not in the word.

Guess 4: urial
Feedback: U(x) R(✓) I(✓) A(✓) L(x)
Meaning:
- R is in position 2 (confirmed).
- I is in the word and in position 3 (because we guessed I at position 3 and got a check).
- A is in position 4 (confirmed).
- U and L are not in the word.

Now, combining all feedback:

- The word has R in position 2, I in position 3, and A in position 4.
- So the pattern is: _ R I A _ 

- Excluded letters: C, E, N, T, S, Y, B, O, D, U, L (from all x's)

- We know the word must be of the form: [letter1] R I A [letter5]

- Available letters: We must avoid the excluded letters. The excluded letters are: B, C, D, E, L, N, O, S, T, U, Y.

- The remaining letters are: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and note that A, R, I are already placed, so they can be reused? But we don't know if the word has duplicates. However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far, so we assume no duplicates? But we should not rule out duplicates? However, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But in this case, we are missing two positions, and we have no indication of duplicates yet.

But note: we have placed three distinct letters: R, I, A. The word might have five distinct letters? Or it might have duplicates? We don't know.

However, the missing letters are position1 and position5. We need to choose two letters from the available set: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ R I A _ :

- Let's think of common words:
  - ""TRIAL"": but T is excluded? (from guess2: T(x)) -> invalid.
  - ""FRIAR"": F R I A R -> but R is repeated? And the last letter is R. But we have R at position2? So if we have R at position5? That would be a duplicate? And we haven't tested for duplicates? Also, F is available? But let's see: F(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), R(5). Then the feedback for position5: if we guess R, and the word has R at position2, then if there is another R? It would be marked as '-'? But in our feedback for guess4, we had R at position2 and it was marked ✓, but we didn't have R elsewhere? So we don't know? But in this case, we are guessing R at position5? It might be marked as '-' if present? Or if not, then x? But we don't know? However, we are trying to solve? 

  But ""FRIAR"" has duplicate R? And we don't know if the word has duplicates? So we can consider? But T is excluded? Wait, ""FRIAR"" doesn't have T? But we have F? 

  However, we are going to guess a word? But we have to avoid excluded letters? F is not excluded? So ""FRIAR"" is a candidate? 

  But let's see the pattern: position5 is R? 

  Alternatively, ""PRIAM"": P R I A M? Then M at position5? 

  ""PRIAM"" is a proper name? But sometimes allowed? 

  ""CRIBS"": C excluded? 

  ""GRIMY"": G R I M Y? But Y excluded? 

  ""WRING"": W R I N G? N excluded? 

  ""PRINT"": P R I N T? N and T excluded? 

  ""FRISK"": F R I S K? S excluded? 

  ""PRIMA"": P R I M A? But then position4 is M? Not A? But we have A fixed at position4? So no? 

  We require position4 to be A? So ""PRIMA"" is P R I M A? Then position4 is M? Not A? So invalid pattern? 

  We need the pattern: [1] R I A [5]

  So the word must have ""RIA"" in positions 2,3,4? 

  So ""FRIAR"": F R I A R -> positions: 1:F, 2:R, 3:I, 4:A, 5:R -> pattern matches? 

  ""PRIAL""? Not a word? 

  ""TRIAC"": T and C excluded? 

  ""BRIAR"": B excluded? 

  ""GRIFF"": G R I F F? Then position4 is F? Not A? 

  ""GRILL"": G R I L L? L excluded?

  ""WRITE"": W R I T E? T and E excluded? 

  ""DRIVE"": D excluded? 

  ""GRIPE"": G R I P E? E excluded? 

  ""TRIPE"": T excluded? 

  ""SWIFT"": S, W? But S excluded? 

  So after this, ""FRIAR"" seems a candidate? 

  But we have to check if duplicate R is allowed? The feedback hasn't indicated any duplicate? But we haven't guessed a duplicate? 

  Another candidate: ""PRIAL"" is not a word? 

  ""BRIAS"": B excluded? 

  ""CRIAS"": C excluded? 

  ""GRIAS"": G R I A S? But S excluded? 

  ""KRIAS"": K R I A S? S excluded? 

  ""PRIAS"": P R I A S? S excluded? 

  ""VRIAS"": V R I A S? S excluded? 

  ""ARIAS"": A at position1? But we know A is not at position1? From guess2? And also, S excluded? 

  ""ORIKS""? O excluded? 

  So ""FRIAR"" is the only common word I can think of? 

  But let me confirm: ""FRIAR"" is a valid English word? Yes, meaning a member of a religious order.

  Now, if we guess ""FRIAR"", what feedback do we expect?
  - Position1: F -> if the word has F? We don't know? If it does, then ✓ or -? But we are guessing F at position1? 
  - Position2: R -> ✓ (fixed)
  - Position3: I -> ✓ (fixed)
  - Position4: A -> ✓ (fixed)
  - Position5: R -> if the word has another R? Then it would be marked as '-'? Because the R at position2 is already accounted for? Or if the word has only one R? Then it would be marked as x? 

  But we don't know if the word has duplicate R? 

  Alternatively, if the word is ""FRIAR"", then the secret word has two R's? Then the feedback for position5: R would be marked as '-'? Because it is present but in the wrong position? (since the only correct R is at position2? and position5 is not R? But if there is another R? Then it would be marked as present but wrong position? 

  But in our pattern, we have R at position2? So if the word has R at position5? Then it's a duplicate? 

  However, we don't know? 

  But note: we have only one guess left? Because we have 6 tries? We are on guess 5? 

  We must be careful? 

  Another possibility: ""PRIAM"" (a name) -> P R I A M? Then pattern: P(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), M(5). This fits? And M is available? 

  ""PRIAM"" is a proper name? But sometimes Wordle uses proper names? Or not? Typically, Wordle uses common words? But ""Priam"" is the king of Troy? 

  But let's see: if we avoid proper names? Then ""FRIAR"" is better? 

  Also, ""GRIFF"": doesn't fit? 

  ""QUIFF"": Q U I F F? But position2 is U? Not R? 

  So between ""FRIAR"" and ""PRIAM"", which one? 

  We have not excluded P? So ""PRIAM"" is a candidate? 

  Also, ""FRIAR"" uses F and duplicate R? 

  But we have no evidence against duplicates? 

  However, to maximize information? We might want to avoid duplicates? 

  But we are running out of guesses? 

  Let me list all possible words? 

  Pattern: [F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Z] R I A [F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Z] 

  And the word must be valid? 

  Examples:
  - F R I A F? Not a word? 
  - F R I A R -> ""FRIAR""
  - G R I A G? Not?
  - G R I A L? But L excluded? 
  - H R I A H? Not?
  - H R I A T? T excluded? 
  - J R I A J? Not?
  - K R I A K? Not?
  - M R I A M? ""MRIAM""? Not a word? 
  - P R I A P? ""PRIAP""? Not common? 
  - P R I A M? ""PRIAM"" (proper name)
  - Q R I A Q? Not?
  - V R I A V? Not?
  - W R I A W? Not?
  - X R I A X? Not?
  - Z R I A Z? Not?

  Also, with different letters:
  - F R I A M? ""FRIAM""? Not a word?
  - G R I A F? ""GRIAF""? Not?
  - H R I A M? ""HRIAM""? Not?
  - P R I A F? ""PRIAF""? Not?
  - etc.

  So the only common words are ""FRIAR"" and ""PRIAM"" (if we accept proper names).

  But ""PRIAM"" is not a common noun? 

  Another: ""BRIAR"" is excluded because B is excluded? 

  ""CRIAR""? Not a word? 

  So we have two options: ""FRIAR"" and ""PRIAM"". 

  Since ""FRIAR"" is a common word, I'll go with that? 

  But note: in ""FRIAR"", we are guessing R at position5? And we already have R at position2? So if the word has only one R? Then position5 will be marked as x? And we know the word must have R only at position2? Then we can deduce that the word is not ""FRIAR""? 

  Alternatively, if it is ""FRIAR"", then we get feedback: F(?), R(✓), I(✓), A(✓), R(-) if there is a duplicate? Or if the word has only one R? Then R at position5 would be x? 

  But we know the word has at least one R (at position2)? So if we get R at position5 marked as x? Then the word has no second R? So ""FRIAR"" is wrong? 

  Similarly, if we get R at position5 marked as '-'? Then it is present? So the word has two R's? 

  But we don't know? 

  However, we have to guess? 

  Alternatively, we can guess ""PRIAM"" to avoid the duplicate? 

  But ""PRIAM"" is a proper name? And might not be in the word list? 

  Another word: ""TRIAD"" -> T and D excluded? 

  So I think ""FRIAR"" is the best bet? 

  But let me check the feedback we would get if the word is ""PRIAM"": 
  - P at position1: if present? 
  - R at2: ✓
  - I at3: ✓
  - A at4: ✓
  - M at5: if present? 

  And if the word is ""FRIAR"", we get:
  - F at1: if present?
  - R at2: ✓
  - I at3: ✓
  - A at4: ✓
  - R at5: either - or x? 

  But we don't know? 

  However, we have only one guess left? We are on guess 5? We have 6 tries? So we can try? 

  I think we should go with ""FRIAR"" because it is a common word? 

  But let me see if there is another word? 

  What about ""GRIFF""? No, because position4 must be A? 

  ""WHIFF""? W H I F F? But position2 is H? Not R? 

  So I think ""FRIAR"" is the word? 

  Therefore, I'll guess ""FRIAR"". 

  But note: we have excluded L? And U? So no? 

  So <guess>friar</guess> 

  Alternatively, if we are not sure? We can try a word that uses two new letters? But we have to fill the pattern? 

  But we don't have many options? 

  So I go with ""FRIAR"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Pattern Established**:
   - Position 2: **R** (✓ in all guesses).
   - Position 3: **I** (✓ in Guess 4).
   - Position 4: **A** (✓ in Guess 3 and 4).
   - The word pattern is: `_ R I A _`.

2. **Excluded Letters** (from all ❌ feedback):  
   `B, C, D, E, L, N, O, S, T, U, Y`.  
   - **Available letters**: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

3. **Key Insights**:
   - Position 1 and 5 must be filled with letters from the available set.
   - The word must contain **no duplicates** (no feedback indicated duplicates so far).
   - Common words fitting `_ R I A _` are limited due to exclusions (e.g., ""TRIAL"" invalid due to T, ""BRIAR"" invalid due to B).

4. **Top Candidate**: **""FRIAR""**  
   - **Fits the pattern**: `F R I A R`.
   - **Why it works**:
     - Tests **F** (new letter) in position 1.
     - Tests **R** in position 5 (possible duplicate; if present, feedback will clarify).
     - Avoids all excluded letters.
   - **If correct**: Positions 1 (F) and 5 (R) will show ✓ or positional feedback.
   - **If incorrect**: Feedback on F/R will reveal if duplicates exist or narrow options further.
