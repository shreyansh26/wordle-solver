We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since ""crane"" is c-r-a-n-e, so 1-indexed position 4? But note: in programming, we often use 0-indexed. However, the feedback is per letter and we know the position).

 Let's break down the word ""crane"":
 Position 1: C -> x (not in word)
 Position 2: R -> x (not in word)
 Position 3: A -> x (not in word)
 Position 4: N -> ✓ (correct and in position 4)
 Position 5: E -> x (not in word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter 'N' in the 4th position.
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.

 We must avoid using C, R, A, E in our next guess.

 Also, note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Since we know the 4th letter is 'N', we can form a new word that has 'N' in the 4th position and uses other letters that are not C, R, A, E.

 We have to choose a word that uses new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: we have used C, R, A, N, E. So we can use letters like B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we know N is in the 4th position, so we must have a word of the form: _ _ _ N _

 We want to maximize the information we get. So we should try to include as many new common letters as possible.

 Some common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

 Example words: 
 - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but N is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> N is the 4th letter? Yes: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> so that fits.

 However, we must avoid using the letters that we know are absent: C, R, A, E. ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, N, T. None of these are in the forbidden list (C, R, A, E). So it's a candidate.

 But note: we also know that the word must be valid. ""POINT"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we could use ""JOINT"", ""MOUNT"", etc.

 However, we want to test as many new letters as possible. ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, T which are new.

 Another candidate: ""SLING"" -> but that's 5 letters? S-L-I-N-G -> positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> so that fits. And letters S, L, I, G are new.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

 Let me think of a word that has the 4th letter as N and uses common letters that we haven't tried.

 Another idea: ""SHINY"" -> S-H-I-N-Y -> 4th letter is N? Actually, S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). So that works. And letters S, H, I, Y are new.

 But we don't know if H or Y are in the word. We are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has a double letter? But we don't have any indication of double letters yet.

 Since we have only one letter fixed (N at position 4), we can try to cover multiple common consonants and vowels.

 We haven't tried the vowel 'O' or 'U'. We have tried A and E (which are absent) and we haven't tried I, O, U.

 Let me try to form a word with O and I and other common consonants.

 Word: ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) -> as above.

 Another: ""JOINT"" (J, O, I, N, T) -> J is less common, so maybe not.

 ""MOIST"" (M, O, I, S, T) -> but then the 4th letter is S, not N. So that doesn't have N in the 4th position.

 We must have the 4th letter as N.

 So let's list words ending with ""N"" in the 4th position? Actually, the 4th letter is the second last? Because the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 -> so the 4th is the one before last.

 Words: 
 - ...N? -> so the pattern is: [letter1][letter2][letter3]N[letter5]

 We can use: 
 - ""BLANK"": B-L-A-N-K -> but A is absent (we know A is not in the word) -> so invalid because we can't use A.
 - ""CLINK"": C is absent -> invalid.
 - ""FLANK"": F-L-A-N-K -> A is absent -> invalid.
 - ""PLANK"": P-L-A-N-K -> A absent -> invalid.
 - ""THINK"": T-H-I-N-K -> letters: T, H, I, N, K. None of these are in the forbidden list (C, R, A, E). So that's a candidate.

 ""THINK"" has T, H, I, K which are new.

 Another: ""STINK"": S-T-I-N-K -> but S, T, I, K are new. However, we have to avoid S? No, we haven't tried S and it's not forbidden.

 But note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, R, A, E. So S is allowed.

 However, ""STINK"" is a valid word.

 But let me compare:
 - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> tests P, O, I, T (and we know N is fixed)
 - ""THINK"": T, H, I, N, K -> tests T, H, I, K
 - ""SHINY"": S, H, I, N, Y -> tests S, H, I, Y

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know E, A are absent. So we focus on T, O, I, S, etc.

 ""POINT"" covers P, O, I, T -> which includes O (a vowel) and T (common consonant). 
 ""THINK"" covers T, H, I, K -> H and K are less common than O and S? 
 ""SHINY"" covers S, H, I, Y -> S is very common.

 Since we already know N is in the 4th position, we can try to get information about the other positions.

 I think ""POINT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we haven't tried O and I (vowels) and P and T (common consonants).

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can also consider using a word that doesn't reuse the same vowel? We are using I again? Actually, we haven't tried I before, so it's new.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has two vowels? For example, ""OPINE"" -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E. And also, the 4th letter must be N. ""OPINE"" is O-P-I-N-E -> but E is absent and we cannot use it.

 So let's go with ""POINT"".

 But wait: what about ""JOINT""? J is not common, so we avoid.

 Another candidate: ""MOUNT"" -> M-O-U-N-T -> 4th letter is N? M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5). And letters: M, O, U, T. We haven't tried M, O, U, T. And U is a vowel we haven't tried. This might be even better because we test a new vowel U.

 However, we don't know if U is in the word. But we are trying to get information.

 ""MOUNT"" is a valid word.

 Now, comparing ""POINT"" and ""MOUNT"":
 - ""POINT"": tests P, O, I, T -> and we know N is fixed. We test two vowels: O and I.
 - ""MOUNT"": tests M, O, U, T -> two vowels: O and U.

 Since we have already eliminated A and E, the remaining vowels are I, O, U. Testing two vowels at once might be efficient.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize the chance of hitting a correct letter.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has one vowel and three new consonants? But we don't know which vowels are present.

 I think ""MOUNT"" is a good choice because it tests two new vowels (O and U) and two new consonants (M and T). Also, T is a very common consonant.

 So I'll go with ""MOUNT"".

 But wait: what if the word has both O and U? Then we get more hits. If it has only one, we know which one. If none, then we know the vowel must be I (or maybe none? but we don't know if there is a vowel requirement).

 However, we are not forced to test vowels. But since we have eliminated two vowels (A and E), we should test the others.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that uses the vowel I and other common consonants. For example, ""LINGO"" -> but that doesn't have N in the 4th position: L-I-N-G-O -> N is in position 3, not 4.

 We must have the 4th letter as N.

 So let me stick with ""MOUNT"".

 But note: we must not use the forbidden letters. ""MOUNT"" has M, O, U, N, T -> none of these are C, R, A, E. So it's valid.

 Therefore, I choose ""MOUNT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- N is **correct and in the 4th position**.

For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
- Avoids C, R, A, E entirely.
- Has 'N' in the 4th position.
- Tests new common letters (especially vowels like O, I, U, and consonants like M, T, S) to maximize information.

I considered words like ""point"" (tests P, O, I, T) and ""think"" (tests T, H, I, K), but settled on **""mount""** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ _ N _`.
- It tests new vowels (O, U) and consonants (M, T), which are common.
- It avoids forbidden letters and reuses only the known 'N' in position 4.

 Position 2: R -> x (not in word)

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

 Let me think of a word that has the 4th letter as N and uses common letters that we haven't tried.

 Another idea: ""SHINY"" -> S-H-I-N-Y -> 4th letter is N? Actually, S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). So that works. And letters S, H, I, Y are new.

 Position 5: E -> x (not in word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter 'N' in the 4th position.
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.

 We must avoid using C, R, A, E in our next guess.

 Also, note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Since we know the 4th letter is 'N', we can form a new word that has 'N' in the 4th position and uses other letters that are not C, R, A, E.

 We have to choose a word that uses new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: we have used C, R, A, N, E. So we can use letters like B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we know N is in the 4th position, so we must have a word of the form: _ _ _ N _

 We want to maximize the information we get. So we should try to include as many new common letters as possible.

 Some common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

 Example words: 
 - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but N is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> N is the 4th letter? Yes: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> so that fits.

 However, we must avoid using the letters that we know are absent: C, R, A, E. ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, N, T. None of these are in the forbidden list (C, R, A, E). So it's a candidate.

 But note: we also know that the word must be valid. ""POINT"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we could use ""JOINT"", ""MOUNT"", etc.

 However, we want to test as many new letters as possible. ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, T which are new.

 Another candidate: ""SLING"" -> but that's 5 letters? S-L-I-N-G -> positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> so that fits. And letters S, L, I, G are new.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

 Let me think of a word that has the 4th letter as N and uses common letters that we haven't tried.

 Another idea: ""SHINY"" -> S-H-I-N-Y -> 4th letter is N? Actually, S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). So that works. And letters S, H, I, Y are new.

 But we don't know if H or Y are in the word. We are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has a double letter? But we don't have any indication of double letters yet.

 Since we have only one letter fixed (N at position 4), we can try to cover multiple common consonants and vowels.

 We haven't tried the vowel 'O' or 'U'. We have tried A and E (which are absent) and we haven't tried I, O, U.

 Let me try to form a word with O and I and other common consonants.

 Word: ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) -> as above.

 Another: ""JOINT"" (J, O, I, N, T) -> J is less common, so maybe not.

 ""MOIST"" (M, O, I, S, T) -> but then the 4th letter is S, not N. So that doesn't have N in the 4th position.

 We must have the 4th letter as N.

 So let's list words ending with ""N"" in the 4th position? Actually, the 4th letter is the second last? Because the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 -> so the 4th is the one before last.

 Words: 
 - ...N? -> so the pattern is: [letter1][letter2][letter3]N[letter5]

 We can use: 
 - ""BLANK"": B-L-A-N-K -> but A is absent (we know A is not in the word) -> so invalid because we can't use A.
 - ""CLINK"": C is absent -> invalid.
 - ""FLANK"": F-L-A-N-K -> A is absent -> invalid.
 - ""PLANK"": P-L-A-N-K -> A absent -> invalid.
 - ""THINK"": T-H-I-N-K -> letters: T, H, I, N, K. None of these are in the forbidden list (C, R, A, E). So that's a candidate.

 ""THINK"" has T, H, I, K which are new.

 Another: ""STINK"": S-T-I-N-K -> but S, T, I, K are new. However, we have to avoid S? No, we haven't tried S and it's not forbidden.

 But note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, R, A, E. So S is allowed.

 However, ""STINK"" is a valid word.

 But let me compare:
 - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> tests P, O, I, T (and we know N is fixed)
 - ""THINK"": T, H, I, N, K -> tests T, H, I, K
 - ""SHINY"": S, H, I, N, Y -> tests S, H, I, Y

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know E, A are absent. So we focus on T, O, I, S, etc.

 ""POINT"" covers P, O, I, T -> which includes O (a vowel) and T (common consonant). 
 ""THINK"" covers T, H, I, K -> H and K are less common than O and S? 
 ""SHINY"" covers S, H, I, Y -> S is very common.

 Since we already know N is in the 4th position, we can try to get information about the other positions.

 I think ""POINT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we haven't tried O and I (vowels) and P and T (common consonants).

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can also consider using a word that doesn't reuse the same vowel? We are using I again? Actually, we haven't tried I before, so it's new.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has two vowels? For example, ""OPINE"" -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E. And also, the 4th letter must be N. ""OPINE"" is O-P-I-N-E -> but E is absent and we cannot use it.

 So let's go with ""POINT"".

 But wait: what about ""JOINT""? J is not common, so we avoid.

 Another candidate: ""MOUNT"" -> M-O-U-N-T -> 4th letter is N? M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5). And letters: M, O, U, T. We haven't tried M, O, U, T. And U is a vowel we haven't tried. This might be even better because we test a new vowel U.

 However, we don't know if U is in the word. But we are trying to get information.

 ""MOUNT"" is a valid word.

 Now, comparing ""POINT"" and ""MOUNT"":
 - ""POINT"": tests P, O, I, T -> and we know N is fixed. We test two vowels: O and I.
 - ""MOUNT"": tests M, O, U, T -> two vowels: O and U.

 Since we have already eliminated A and E, the remaining vowels are I, O, U. Testing two vowels at once might be efficient.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize the chance of hitting a correct letter.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has one vowel and three new consonants? But we don't know which vowels are present.

 I think ""MOUNT"" is a good choice because it tests two new vowels (O and U) and two new consonants (M and T). Also, T is a very common consonant.

 So I'll go with ""MOUNT"".

 But wait: what if the word has both O and U? Then we get more hits. If it has only one, we know which one. If none, then we know the vowel must be I (or maybe none? but we don't know if there is a vowel requirement).

 However, we are not forced to test vowels. But since we have eliminated two vowels (A and E), we should test the others.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that uses the vowel I and other common consonants. For example, ""LINGO"" -> but that doesn't have N in the 4th position: L-I-N-G-O -> N is in position 3, not 4.

 We must have the 4th letter as N.

 So let me stick with ""MOUNT"".

 But note: we must not use the forbidden letters. ""MOUNT"" has M, O, U, N, T -> none of these are C, R, A, E. So it's valid.

 Therefore, I choose ""MOUNT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- N is **correct and in the 4th position**.

For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
- Avoids C, R, A, E entirely.
- Has 'N' in the 4th position.
- Tests new common letters (especially vowels like O, I, U, and consonants like M, T, S) to maximize information.

I considered words like ""point"" (tests P, O, I, T) and ""think"" (tests T, H, I, K), but settled on **""mount""** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ _ N _`.
- It tests new vowels (O, U) and consonants (M, T), which are common.
- It avoids forbidden letters and reuses only the known 'N' in position 4.

We are given feedback for the second guess ""mount"":
 M(x) -> M is not in the secret word.
 O(x) -> O is not in the secret word.
 U(✓) -> U is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since ""mount"" is m-o-u-n-t, so positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T).
 N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, which we already knew).
 T(x) -> T is not in the secret word.

 Therefore, we now know:
 - The secret word has the letter 'U' in the 3rd position and 'N' in the 4th position.
 - The letters M, O, T are not in the secret word (in addition to the previously known absent letters: C, R, A, E).

 So, absent letters: C, R, A, E, M, O, T.

 And we know the pattern: the word is _ _ U N _ 

 We have to avoid using the absent letters: C, R, A, E, M, O, T.

 We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, U, T (from both guesses). 
 So new letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We know the word must have a U in position 3 and N in position 4.

 So the pattern is: [letter1] [letter2] U N [letter5]

 We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only the available letters.

 We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, I, D, G, H, etc.

 Example words:
 - ""SHUNS"": S-H-U-N-S -> but U is in position 3? S(1), H(2), U(3), N(4), S(5). But we have two S's? And we don't know if S is in the word. However, we must avoid using T? T is absent, but S is allowed. But note: the feedback for ""mount"" didn't say anything about S. However, we haven't used S yet. But ""SHUNS"" has S at the end and beginning. Also, we are testing S twice? We might not want to test the same letter twice if we can avoid it, to maximize information.

 But we don't know if S is in the word. However, using two S's might not be efficient.

 Alternative: ""SHUNK"" -> S-H-U-N-K -> tests S, H, K. But K is less common.

 ""SHINY"" -> but we have to have U in position 3, so ""SHINY"" is S-H-I-N-Y -> position 3 is I, not U. So invalid.

 We must have U in position 3 and N in position 4.

 Another word: ""FLUNG"" -> F-L-U-N-G -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G. Letters: F, L, U, N, G. None of these are in the absent list. So that's a candidate.

 But we haven't tried F, L, G.

 Another: ""BLUNT"" -> but T is absent, so we cannot use T.

 ""CLUNG"" -> C is absent -> invalid.

 ""PLUNG"" -> P-L-U-N-G -> P, L, U, N, G. P and L are new. But note: we have to avoid C, R, A, E, M, O, T. P is allowed. So that's a candidate.

 ""SLUNG"" -> S-L-U-N-G -> S, L, U, N, G. S and L are common.

 Now, comparing:
 - ""FLUNG"": tests F, L, G
 - ""PLUNG"": tests P, L, G
 - ""SLUNG"": tests S, L, G

 We want to test the most common letters. S is more common than F or P.

 So ""SLUNG"" might be a good choice because it tests S (very common) and L (also common) and G.

 But note: we are also testing L in position 2 and G in position 5.

 Alternatively, we could test a word that includes a vowel? We haven't tried I or other vowels. The only vowels left are I and sometimes Y (as a vowel). We know A, E, O are absent, and U is present (but we know its position). So the word must have at least one vowel? Actually, U is a vowel, so we have one vowel. But there might be another vowel? For example, in the first or second position? We haven't tested I yet.

 We should test I because it's a common vowel.

 How about a word that has I in position 1 or 2? For example, ""SHUNT"" -> but T is absent. ""SHUNK"" -> no I. ""SWUNG"" -> S-W-U-N-G -> tests S, W, G. But no I.

 We can try ""BLIND"" -> but that doesn't have U in position 3.

 We must have U in position 3 and N in position 4.

 So the word must be: [letter1][letter2]UN[letter5]

 We can use I in position 1 or 2.

 Example: ""DIURN"" -> but that's not a common word? And it's 5 letters? D-I-U-R-N -> but R is absent, so we cannot use R.

 ""GIUNT"" -> not a word.

 ""QUINS"" -> Q-U-I-N-S -> but Q is followed by U? In this case, position 1: Q, 2: U? But we need U in position 3. So that doesn't work.

 ""BUILT"" -> B-U-I-L-T -> but U is in position 2, not 3. And T is absent.

 It's hard to find a word with I and the pattern.

 Another idea: ""GUILD"" -> G-U-I-L-D -> U is in position 2, not 3.

 We need U in position 3.

 How about ""SUING"" -> S-U-I-N-G -> but that's S(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). So U is in position 2, not 3. And we need U in position 3.

 So we cannot use ""SUING"".

 After some thought, I recall that there are words like ""BRUNG"" but that's not standard. 

 Let me think of common words: 
 - ""SWUNG"": S-W-U-N-G -> positions: 1:S, 2:W, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G -> fits the pattern. And letters: S, W, U, N, G. We haven't tried W. But we are testing S and W and G.

 But we are not testing I.

 Alternatively, ""STUNG"" -> but T is absent.

 ""FLUNG"" and ""SLUNG"" are the main candidates.

 But we haven't tested I, which is a common vowel. We should test I if possible.

 How about ""GUANO""? But O is absent and the pattern doesn't match.

 Another word: ""QUINT"" -> Q-U-I-N-T -> but T is absent and U is in position 2? Q(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). So that would be: position 3 is I, not U. We need position 3 to be U.

 I think it's difficult to include I without moving U. So maybe we should focus on testing other common consonants and leave I for the next guess if necessary.

 Since we have only 4 guesses left (we are on guess 3), we should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

 The most common letters left: S, L, D, H, I, G, B, etc.

 We can choose a word that tests S and L and H? But we have to fit the pattern.

 How about ""SHUNK"": S-H-U-N-K -> tests S, H, K. But we don't test L.

 ""SLUNG"": tests S, L, G.

 ""SHULN"" -> not a word.

 I think ""SLUNG"" is a good choice because it tests two common consonants: S and L.

 But note: we are using G at the end. We could use ""SLINK"" but that has I? S-L-I-N-K -> but then position 3 is I, not U. So invalid.

 So I'll go with ""SLUNG"".

 However, let me check if there's a word that includes I. 

 ""BUILD"" doesn't work. ""QUILT"" doesn't work. ""JUICE"" has E and U in the wrong position.

 Another idea: ""LUMIN"" -> not a word, and M is absent.

 ""GUIMP"" -> not a word.

 I think we have to accept that we can't test I in this guess without sacrificing the pattern.

 So we choose ""SLUNG"".

 But wait, what about ""BLUFF""? B-L-U-F-F -> but F is repeated? And position 3 is U? B(1), L(2), U(3), F(4), F(5). But we need N in position 4. So that doesn't work.

 ""FLUFF"" -> same issue, and no N.

 So I think ""SLUNG"" is a valid and good choice.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""SLUNG"".

 But note: we are using U and N again, which we already know. But that's okay because we have to have them in those positions.

 We are testing S in position 1, L in position 2, and G in position 5.

 If S is in the word, we'll get feedback for position 1. Similarly for L and G.

 So let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, M, O, T (from ""crane"" and ""mount"" feedback).
- **Correct positions**: 
  - 3rd letter is **U** (from ""mount"" feedback: U✓).
  - 4th letter is **N** (from both ""crane"" and ""mount"" feedback: N✓).
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ _ U N _`.

For the next guess:
- Must avoid absent letters (C, R, A, E, M, O, T).
- Must have **U in position 3** and **N in position 4**.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, L, I, G, H) to maximize information.

After evaluating options:
- **""slung""** fits perfectly: 
  - Pattern: `S(1) L(2) U(3) N(4) G(5)`.
  - Tests new common letters: **S** (position 1), **L** (position 2), and **G** (position 5).
  - Avoids all absent letters.

This guess efficiently tests high-frequency consonants while respecting the known constraints.

<guess>slung</guess>",slung,"We are given feedback for the second guess ""mount"":
 M(x) -> M is not in the secret word.
 O(x) -> O is not in the secret word.
 U(✓) -> U is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since ""mount"" is m-o-u-n-t, so positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T).
 N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, which we already knew).
 T(x) -> T is not in the secret word.

 Therefore, we now know:
 - The secret word has the letter 'U' in the 3rd position and 'N' in the 4th position.
 - The letters M, O, T are not in the secret word (in addition to the previously known absent letters: C, R, A, E).

 So, absent letters: C, R, A, E, M, O, T.

 And we know the pattern: the word is _ _ U N _ 

 We have to avoid using the absent letters: C, R, A, E, M, O, T.

 We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, U, T (from both guesses). 
 So new letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We know the word must have a U in position 3 and N in position 4.

 So the pattern is: [letter1] [letter2] U N [letter5]

 We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only the available letters.

 We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, I, D, G, H, etc.

 Example words:
 - ""SHUNS"": S-H-U-N-S -> but U is in position 3? S(1), H(2), U(3), N(4), S(5). But we have two S's? And we don't know if S is in the word. However, we must avoid using T? T is absent, but S is allowed. But note: the feedback for ""mount"" didn't say anything about S. However, we haven't used S yet. But ""SHUNS"" has S at the end and beginning. Also, we are testing S twice? We might not want to test the same letter twice if we can avoid it, to maximize information.

 But we don't know if S is in the word. However, using two S's might not be efficient.

 Alternative: ""SHUNK"" -> S-H-U-N-K -> tests S, H, K. But K is less common.

 ""SHINY"" -> but we have to have U in position 3, so ""SHINY"" is S-H-I-N-Y -> position 3 is I, not U. So invalid.

 We must have U in position 3 and N in position 4.

 Another word: ""FLUNG"" -> F-L-U-N-G -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G. Letters: F, L, U, N, G. None of these are in the absent list. So that's a candidate.

 But we haven't tried F, L, G.

 Another: ""BLUNT"" -> but T is absent, so we cannot use T.

 ""CLUNG"" -> C is absent -> invalid.

 ""PLUNG"" -> P-L-U-N-G -> P, L, U, N, G. P and L are new. But note: we have to avoid C, R, A, E, M, O, T. P is allowed. So that's a candidate.

 ""SLUNG"" -> S-L-U-N-G -> S, L, U, N, G. S and L are common.

 Now, comparing:
 - ""FLUNG"": tests F, L, G
 - ""PLUNG"": tests P, L, G
 - ""SLUNG"": tests S, L, G

 We want to test the most common letters. S is more common than F or P.

 So ""SLUNG"" might be a good choice because it tests S (very common) and L (also common) and G.

 But note: we are also testing L in position 2 and G in position 5.

 Alternatively, we could test a word that includes a vowel? We haven't tried I or other vowels. The only vowels left are I and sometimes Y (as a vowel). We know A, E, O are absent, and U is present (but we know its position). So the word must have at least one vowel? Actually, U is a vowel, so we have one vowel. But there might be another vowel? For example, in the first or second position? We haven't tested I yet.

 We should test I because it's a common vowel.

 How about a word that has I in position 1 or 2? For example, ""SHUNT"" -> but T is absent. ""SHUNK"" -> no I. ""SWUNG"" -> S-W-U-N-G -> tests S, W, G. But no I.

 We can try ""BLIND"" -> but that doesn't have U in position 3.

 We must have U in position 3 and N in position 4.

 So the word must be: [letter1][letter2]UN[letter5]

 We can use I in position 1 or 2.

 Example: ""DIURN"" -> but that's not a common word? And it's 5 letters? D-I-U-R-N -> but R is absent, so we cannot use R.

 ""GIUNT"" -> not a word.

 ""QUINS"" -> Q-U-I-N-S -> but Q is followed by U? In this case, position 1: Q, 2: U? But we need U in position 3. So that doesn't work.

 ""BUILT"" -> B-U-I-L-T -> but U is in position 2, not 3. And T is absent.

 It's hard to find a word with I and the pattern.

 Another idea: ""GUILD"" -> G-U-I-L-D -> U is in position 2, not 3.

 We need U in position 3.

 How about ""SUING"" -> S-U-I-N-G -> but that's S(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). So U is in position 2, not 3. And we need U in position 3.

 So we cannot use ""SUING"".

 After some thought, I recall that there are words like ""BRUNG"" but that's not standard. 

 Let me think of common words: 
 - ""SWUNG"": S-W-U-N-G -> positions: 1:S, 2:W, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G -> fits the pattern. And letters: S, W, U, N, G. We haven't tried W. But we are testing S and W and G.

 But we are not testing I.

 Alternatively, ""STUNG"" -> but T is absent.

 ""FLUNG"" and ""SLUNG"" are the main candidates.

 But we haven't tested I, which is a common vowel. We should test I if possible.

 How about ""GUANO""? But O is absent and the pattern doesn't match.

 Another word: ""QUINT"" -> Q-U-I-N-T -> but T is absent and U is in position 2? Q(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). So that would be: position 3 is I, not U. We need position 3 to be U.

 I think it's difficult to include I without moving U. So maybe we should focus on testing other common consonants and leave I for the next guess if necessary.

 Since we have only 4 guesses left (we are on guess 3), we should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

 The most common letters left: S, L, D, H, I, G, B, etc.

 We can choose a word that tests S and L and H? But we have to fit the pattern.

 How about ""SHUNK"": S-H-U-N-K -> tests S, H, K. But we don't test L.

 ""SLUNG"": tests S, L, G.

 ""SHULN"" -> not a word.

 I think ""SLUNG"" is a good choice because it tests two common consonants: S and L.

 But note: we are using G at the end. We could use ""SLINK"" but that has I? S-L-I-N-K -> but then position 3 is I, not U. So invalid.

 So I'll go with ""SLUNG"".

 However, let me check if there's a word that includes I. 

 ""BUILD"" doesn't work. ""QUILT"" doesn't work. ""JUICE"" has E and U in the wrong position.

 Another idea: ""LUMIN"" -> not a word, and M is absent.

 ""GUIMP"" -> not a word.

 I think we have to accept that we can't test I in this guess without sacrificing the pattern.

 So we choose ""SLUNG"".

 But wait, what about ""BLUFF""? B-L-U-F-F -> but F is repeated? And position 3 is U? B(1), L(2), U(3), F(4), F(5). But we need N in position 4. So that doesn't work.

 ""FLUFF"" -> same issue, and no N.

 So I think ""SLUNG"" is a valid and good choice.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""SLUNG"".

 But note: we are using U and N again, which we already know. But that's okay because we have to have them in those positions.

 We are testing S in position 1, L in position 2, and G in position 5.

 If S is in the word, we'll get feedback for position 1. Similarly for L and G.

 So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, M, O, T (from ""crane"" and ""mount"" feedback).
- **Correct positions**: 
  - 3rd letter is **U** (from ""mount"" feedback: U✓).
  - 4th letter is **N** (from both ""crane"" and ""mount"" feedback: N✓).
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ _ U N _`.

For the next guess:
- Must avoid absent letters (C, R, A, E, M, O, T).
- Must have **U in position 3** and **N in position 4**.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, L, I, G, H) to maximize information.

After evaluating options:
- **""slung""** fits perfectly: 
  - Pattern: `S(1) L(2) U(3) N(4) G(5)`.
  - Tests new common letters: **S** (position 1), **L** (position 2), and **G** (position 5).
  - Avoids all absent letters.

This guess efficiently tests high-frequency consonants while respecting the known constraints.",Guess 3: slung -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(✓) U(✓) N(✓) G(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can give us a lot of information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and no repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since ""crane"" is c-r-a-n-e, so 1-indexed position 4? But note: in programming, we often use 0-indexed. However, the feedback is per letter and we know the position).

 Let's break down the word ""crane"":
 Position 1: C -> x (not in word)
 Position 2: R -> x (not in word)
 Position 3: A -> x (not in word)
 Position 4: N -> ✓ (correct and in position 4)
 Position 5: E -> x (not in word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter 'N' in the 4th position.
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.

 We must avoid using C, R, A, E in our next guess.

 Also, note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Since we know the 4th letter is 'N', we can form a new word that has 'N' in the 4th position and uses other letters that are not C, R, A, E.

 We have to choose a word that uses new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: we have used C, R, A, N, E. So we can use letters like B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we know N is in the 4th position, so we must have a word of the form: _ _ _ N _

 We want to maximize the information we get. So we should try to include as many new common letters as possible.

 Some common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

 Example words: 
 - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but N is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> N is the 4th letter? Yes: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> so that fits.

 However, we must avoid using the letters that we know are absent: C, R, A, E. ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, N, T. None of these are in the forbidden list (C, R, A, E). So it's a candidate.

 But note: we also know that the word must be valid. ""POINT"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we could use ""JOINT"", ""MOUNT"", etc.

 However, we want to test as many new letters as possible. ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, T which are new.

 Another candidate: ""SLING"" -> but that's 5 letters? S-L-I-N-G -> positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> so that fits. And letters S, L, I, G are new.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

 Let me think of a word that has the 4th letter as N and uses common letters that we haven't tried.

 Another idea: ""SHINY"" -> S-H-I-N-Y -> 4th letter is N? Actually, S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). So that works. And letters S, H, I, Y are new.

 But we don't know if H or Y are in the word. We are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has a double letter? But we don't have any indication of double letters yet.

 Since we have only one letter fixed (N at position 4), we can try to cover multiple common consonants and vowels.

 We haven't tried the vowel 'O' or 'U'. We have tried A and E (which are absent) and we haven't tried I, O, U.

 Let me try to form a word with O and I and other common consonants.

 Word: ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) -> as above.

 Another: ""JOINT"" (J, O, I, N, T) -> J is less common, so maybe not.

 ""MOIST"" (M, O, I, S, T) -> but then the 4th letter is S, not N. So that doesn't have N in the 4th position.

 We must have the 4th letter as N.

 So let's list words ending with ""N"" in the 4th position? Actually, the 4th letter is the second last? Because the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 -> so the 4th is the one before last.

 Words: 
 - ...N? -> so the pattern is: [letter1][letter2][letter3]N[letter5]

 We can use: 
 - ""BLANK"": B-L-A-N-K -> but A is absent (we know A is not in the word) -> so invalid because we can't use A.
 - ""CLINK"": C is absent -> invalid.
 - ""FLANK"": F-L-A-N-K -> A is absent -> invalid.
 - ""PLANK"": P-L-A-N-K -> A absent -> invalid.
 - ""THINK"": T-H-I-N-K -> letters: T, H, I, N, K. None of these are in the forbidden list (C, R, A, E). So that's a candidate.

 ""THINK"" has T, H, I, K which are new.

 Another: ""STINK"": S-T-I-N-K -> but S, T, I, K are new. However, we have to avoid S? No, we haven't tried S and it's not forbidden.

 But note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, R, A, E. So S is allowed.

 However, ""STINK"" is a valid word.

 But let me compare:
 - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> tests P, O, I, T (and we know N is fixed)
 - ""THINK"": T, H, I, N, K -> tests T, H, I, K
 - ""SHINY"": S, H, I, N, Y -> tests S, H, I, Y

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know E, A are absent. So we focus on T, O, I, S, etc.

 ""POINT"" covers P, O, I, T -> which includes O (a vowel) and T (common consonant). 
 ""THINK"" covers T, H, I, K -> H and K are less common than O and S? 
 ""SHINY"" covers S, H, I, Y -> S is very common.

 Since we already know N is in the 4th position, we can try to get information about the other positions.

 I think ""POINT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we haven't tried O and I (vowels) and P and T (common consonants).

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can also consider using a word that doesn't reuse the same vowel? We are using I again? Actually, we haven't tried I before, so it's new.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has two vowels? For example, ""OPINE"" -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E. And also, the 4th letter must be N. ""OPINE"" is O-P-I-N-E -> but E is absent and we cannot use it.

 So let's go with ""POINT"".

 But wait: what about ""JOINT""? J is not common, so we avoid.

 Another candidate: ""MOUNT"" -> M-O-U-N-T -> 4th letter is N? M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5). And letters: M, O, U, T. We haven't tried M, O, U, T. And U is a vowel we haven't tried. This might be even better because we test a new vowel U.

 However, we don't know if U is in the word. But we are trying to get information.

 ""MOUNT"" is a valid word.

 Now, comparing ""POINT"" and ""MOUNT"":
 - ""POINT"": tests P, O, I, T -> and we know N is fixed. We test two vowels: O and I.
 - ""MOUNT"": tests M, O, U, T -> two vowels: O and U.

 Since we have already eliminated A and E, the remaining vowels are I, O, U. Testing two vowels at once might be efficient.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize the chance of hitting a correct letter.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has one vowel and three new consonants? But we don't know which vowels are present.

 I think ""MOUNT"" is a good choice because it tests two new vowels (O and U) and two new consonants (M and T). Also, T is a very common consonant.

 So I'll go with ""MOUNT"".

 But wait: what if the word has both O and U? Then we get more hits. If it has only one, we know which one. If none, then we know the vowel must be I (or maybe none? but we don't know if there is a vowel requirement).

 However, we are not forced to test vowels. But since we have eliminated two vowels (A and E), we should test the others.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that uses the vowel I and other common consonants. For example, ""LINGO"" -> but that doesn't have N in the 4th position: L-I-N-G-O -> N is in position 3, not 4.

 We must have the 4th letter as N.

 So let me stick with ""MOUNT"".

 But note: we must not use the forbidden letters. ""MOUNT"" has M, O, U, N, T -> none of these are C, R, A, E. So it's valid.

 Therefore, I choose ""MOUNT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- N is **correct and in the 4th position**.

For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
- Avoids C, R, A, E entirely.
- Has 'N' in the 4th position.
- Tests new common letters (especially vowels like O, I, U, and consonants like M, T, S) to maximize information.

I considered words like ""point"" (tests P, O, I, T) and ""think"" (tests T, H, I, K), but settled on **""mount""** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ _ N _`.
- It tests new vowels (O, U) and consonants (M, T), which are common.
- It avoids forbidden letters and reuses only the known 'N' in position 4.

 O(x) -> O is not in the secret word.

 N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, which we already knew).
 T(x) -> T is not in the secret word.

 Therefore, we now know:
 - The secret word has the letter 'U' in the 3rd position and 'N' in the 4th position.
 - The letters M, O, T are not in the secret word (in addition to the previously known absent letters: C, R, A, E).

 So, absent letters: C, R, A, E, M, O, T.

 And we know the pattern: the word is _ _ U N _ 

 We have to avoid using the absent letters: C, R, A, E, M, O, T.

 We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, U, T (from both guesses). 
 So new letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We know the word must have a U in position 3 and N in position 4.

 So the pattern is: [letter1] [letter2] U N [letter5]

 We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only the available letters.

 We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, I, D, G, H, etc.

 Example words:
 - ""SHUNS"": S-H-U-N-S -> but U is in position 3? S(1), H(2), U(3), N(4), S(5). But we have two S's? And we don't know if S is in the word. However, we must avoid using T? T is absent, but S is allowed. But note: the feedback for ""mount"" didn't say anything about S. However, we haven't used S yet. But ""SHUNS"" has S at the end and beginning. Also, we are testing S twice? We might not want to test the same letter twice if we can avoid it, to maximize information.

 But we don't know if S is in the word. However, using two S's might not be efficient.

 Alternative: ""SHUNK"" -> S-H-U-N-K -> tests S, H, K. But K is less common.

 ""SHINY"" -> but we have to have U in position 3, so ""SHINY"" is S-H-I-N-Y -> position 3 is I, not U. So invalid.

 We must have U in position 3 and N in position 4.

 Another word: ""FLUNG"" -> F-L-U-N-G -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G. Letters: F, L, U, N, G. None of these are in the absent list. So that's a candidate.

 But we haven't tried F, L, G.

 Another: ""BLUNT"" -> but T is absent, so we cannot use T.

 ""CLUNG"" -> C is absent -> invalid.

 ""PLUNG"" -> P-L-U-N-G -> P, L, U, N, G. P and L are new. But note: we have to avoid C, R, A, E, M, O, T. P is allowed. So that's a candidate.

 ""SLUNG"" -> S-L-U-N-G -> S, L, U, N, G. S and L are common.

 Now, comparing:
 - ""FLUNG"": tests F, L, G
 - ""PLUNG"": tests P, L, G
 - ""SLUNG"": tests S, L, G

 We want to test the most common letters. S is more common than F or P.

 So ""SLUNG"" might be a good choice because it tests S (very common) and L (also common) and G.

 But note: we are also testing L in position 2 and G in position 5.

 Alternatively, we could test a word that includes a vowel? We haven't tried I or other vowels. The only vowels left are I and sometimes Y (as a vowel). We know A, E, O are absent, and U is present (but we know its position). So the word must have at least one vowel? Actually, U is a vowel, so we have one vowel. But there might be another vowel? For example, in the first or second position? We haven't tested I yet.

 We should test I because it's a common vowel.

 How about a word that has I in position 1 or 2? For example, ""SHUNT"" -> but T is absent. ""SHUNK"" -> no I. ""SWUNG"" -> S-W-U-N-G -> tests S, W, G. But no I.

 We can try ""BLIND"" -> but that doesn't have U in position 3.

 We must have U in position 3 and N in position 4.

 So the word must be: [letter1][letter2]UN[letter5]

 We can use I in position 1 or 2.

 Example: ""DIURN"" -> but that's not a common word? And it's 5 letters? D-I-U-R-N -> but R is absent, so we cannot use R.

 ""GIUNT"" -> not a word.

 ""QUINS"" -> Q-U-I-N-S -> but Q is followed by U? In this case, position 1: Q, 2: U? But we need U in position 3. So that doesn't work.

 ""BUILT"" -> B-U-I-L-T -> but U is in position 2, not 3. And T is absent.

 It's hard to find a word with I and the pattern.

 Another idea: ""GUILD"" -> G-U-I-L-D -> U is in position 2, not 3.

 We need U in position 3.

 How about ""SUING"" -> S-U-I-N-G -> but that's S(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). So U is in position 2, not 3. And we need U in position 3.

 So we cannot use ""SUING"".

 After some thought, I recall that there are words like ""BRUNG"" but that's not standard. 

 Let me think of common words: 
 - ""SWUNG"": S-W-U-N-G -> positions: 1:S, 2:W, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G -> fits the pattern. And letters: S, W, U, N, G. We haven't tried W. But we are testing S and W and G.

 But we are not testing I.

 Alternatively, ""STUNG"" -> but T is absent.

 ""FLUNG"" and ""SLUNG"" are the main candidates.

 But we haven't tested I, which is a common vowel. We should test I if possible.

 How about ""GUANO""? But O is absent and the pattern doesn't match.

 Another word: ""QUINT"" -> Q-U-I-N-T -> but T is absent and U is in position 2? Q(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). So that would be: position 3 is I, not U. We need position 3 to be U.

 I think it's difficult to include I without moving U. So maybe we should focus on testing other common consonants and leave I for the next guess if necessary.

 Since we have only 4 guesses left (we are on guess 3), we should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

 The most common letters left: S, L, D, H, I, G, B, etc.

 We can choose a word that tests S and L and H? But we have to fit the pattern.

 How about ""SHUNK"": S-H-U-N-K -> tests S, H, K. But we don't test L.

 ""SLUNG"": tests S, L, G.

 ""SHULN"" -> not a word.

 I think ""SLUNG"" is a good choice because it tests two common consonants: S and L.

 But note: we are using G at the end. We could use ""SLINK"" but that has I? S-L-I-N-K -> but then position 3 is I, not U. So invalid.

 So I'll go with ""SLUNG"".

 However, let me check if there's a word that includes I. 

 ""BUILD"" doesn't work. ""QUILT"" doesn't work. ""JUICE"" has E and U in the wrong position.

 Another idea: ""LUMIN"" -> not a word, and M is absent.

 ""GUIMP"" -> not a word.

 I think we have to accept that we can't test I in this guess without sacrificing the pattern.

 So we choose ""SLUNG"".

 But wait, what about ""BLUFF""? B-L-U-F-F -> but F is repeated? And position 3 is U? B(1), L(2), U(3), F(4), F(5). But we need N in position 4. So that doesn't work.

 ""FLUFF"" -> same issue, and no N.

 So I think ""SLUNG"" is a valid and good choice.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""SLUNG"".

 But note: we are using U and N again, which we already know. But that's okay because we have to have them in those positions.

 We are testing S in position 1, L in position 2, and G in position 5.

 If S is in the word, we'll get feedback for position 1. Similarly for L and G.

 So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, M, O, T (from ""crane"" and ""mount"" feedback).
- **Correct positions**: 
  - 3rd letter is **U** (from ""mount"" feedback: U✓).
  - 4th letter is **N** (from both ""crane"" and ""mount"" feedback: N✓).
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ _ U N _`.

For the next guess:
- Must avoid absent letters (C, R, A, E, M, O, T).
- Must have **U in position 3** and **N in position 4**.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, L, I, G, H) to maximize information.

After evaluating options:
- **""slung""** fits perfectly: 
  - Pattern: `S(1) L(2) U(3) N(4) G(5)`.
  - Tests new common letters: **S** (position 1), **L** (position 2), and **G** (position 5).
  - Avoids all absent letters.

This guess efficiently tests high-frequency consonants while respecting the known constraints.

So we can use letters like B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n But note: we know N is in the 4th position, so we must have a word of the form: _ _ _ N _\n\n We want to maximize the information we get. So we should try to include as many new common letters as possible.\n\n Some common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.\n\n Example words: \n - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but N is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> N is the 4th letter? Yes: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> so that fits.\n\n However, we must avoid using the letters that we know are absent: C, R, A, E. ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, N, T. None of these are in the forbidden list (C, R, A, E). So it\'s a candidate.\n\n But note: we also know that the word must be valid. ""POINT"" is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""JOINT"", ""MOUNT"", etc.\n\n However, we want to test as many new letters as possible. ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, T which are new.\n\n Another candidate: ""SLING"" -> but that\'s 5 letters? S-L-I-N-G -> positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> so that fits. And letters S, L, I, G are new.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.\n\n Let me think of a word that has the 4th letter as N and uses common letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n Another idea: ""SHINY"" -> S-H-I-N-Y -> 4th letter is N? Actually, S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). So that works. And letters S, H, I, Y are new.\n\n But we don\'t know if H or Y are in the word. We are trying to get information.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that has a double letter? But we don\'t have any indication of double letters yet.\n\n Since we have only one letter fixed (N at position 4), we can try to cover multiple common consonants and vowels.\n\n We haven\'t tried the vowel \'O\' or \'U\'. We have tried A and E (which are absent) and we haven\'t tried I, O, U.\n\n Let me try to form a word with O and I and other common consonants.\n\n Word: ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) -> as above.\n\n Another: ""JOINT"" (J, O, I, N, T) -> J is less common, so maybe not.\n\n ""MOIST"" (M, O, I, S, T) -> but then the 4th letter is S, not N. So that doesn\'t have N in the 4th position.\n\n We must have the 4th letter as N.\n\n So let\'s list words ending with ""N"" in the 4th position? Actually, the 4th letter is the second last? Because the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 -> so the 4th is the one before last.\n\n Words: \n - ...N? -> so the pattern is: [letter1][letter2][letter3]N[letter5]\n\n We can use: \n - ""BLANK"": B-L-A-N-K -> but A is absent (we know A is not in the word) -> so invalid because we can\'t use A.\n - ""CLINK"": C is absent -> invalid.\n - ""FLANK"": F-L-A-N-K -> A is absent -> invalid.\n - ""PLANK"": P-L-A-N-K -> A absent -> invalid.\n - ""THINK"": T-H-I-N-K -> letters: T, H, I, N, K. None of these are in the forbidden list (C, R, A, E). So that\'s a candidate.\n\n ""THINK"" has T, H, I, K which are new.\n\n Another: ""STINK"": S-T-I-N-K -> but S, T, I, K are new. However, we have to avoid S? No, we haven\'t tried S and it\'s not forbidden.\n\n But note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, R, A, E. So S is allowed.\n\n However, ""STINK"" is a valid word.\n\n But let me compare:\n - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> tests P, O, I, T (and we know N is fixed)\n - ""THINK"": T, H, I, N, K -> tests T, H, I, K\n - ""SHINY"": S, H, I, N, Y -> tests S, H, I, Y\n\n We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know E, A are absent. So we focus on T, O, I, S, etc.\n\n ""POINT"" covers P, O, I, T -> which includes O (a vowel) and T (common consonant). \n ""THINK"" covers T, H, I, K -> H and K are less common than O and S? \n ""SHINY"" covers S, H, I, Y -> S is very common.\n\n Since we already know N is in the 4th position, we can try to get information about the other positions.\n\n I think ""POINT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we haven\'t tried O and I (vowels) and P and T (common consonants).\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can also consider using a word that doesn\'t reuse the same vowel? We are using I again? Actually, we haven\'t tried I before, so it\'s new.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that has two vowels? For example, ""OPINE"" -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E. And also, the 4th letter must be N. ""OPINE"" is O-P-I-N-E -> but E is absent and we cannot use it.\n\n So let\'s go with ""POINT"".\n\n But wait: what about ""JOINT""? J is not common, so we avoid.\n\n Another candidate: ""MOUNT"" -> M-O-U-N-T -> 4th letter is N? M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), T(5). And letters: M, O, U, T. We haven\'t tried M, O, U, T. And U is a vowel we haven\'t tried. This might be even better because we test a new vowel U.\n\n However, we don\'t know if U is in the word. But we are trying to get information.\n\n ""MOUNT"" is a valid word.\n\n Now, comparing ""POINT"" and ""MOUNT"":\n - ""POINT"": tests P, O, I, T -> and we know N is fixed. We test two vowels: O and I.\n - ""MOUNT"": tests M, O, U, T -> two vowels: O and U.\n\n Since we have already eliminated A and E, the remaining vowels are I, O, U. Testing two vowels at once might be efficient.\n\n But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize the chance of hitting a correct letter.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that has one vowel and three new consonants? But we don\'t know which vowels are present.\n\n I think ""MOUNT"" is a good choice because it tests two new vowels (O and U) and two new consonants (M and T). Also, T is a very common consonant.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""MOUNT"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has both O and U? Then we get more hits. If it has only one, we know which one. If none, then we know the vowel must be I (or maybe none? but we don\'t know if there is a vowel requirement).\n\n However, we are not forced to test vowels. But since we have eliminated two vowels (A and E), we should test the others.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that uses the vowel I and other common consonants. For example, ""LINGO"" -> but that doesn\'t have N in the 4th position: L-I-N-G-O -> N is in position 3, not 4.\n\n We must have the 4th letter as N.\n\n So let me stick with ""MOUNT"".\n\n But note: we must not use the forbidden letters. ""MOUNT"" has M, O, U, N, T -> none of these are C, R, A, E. So it\'s valid.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""MOUNT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word.\n- N is **correct and in the 4th position**.\n\nFor the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that:\n- Avoids C, R, A, E entirely.\n- Has \'N\' in the 4th position.\n- Tests new common letters (especially vowels like O, I, U, and consonants like M, T, S) to maximize information.\n\nI considered words like ""point"" (tests P, O, I, T) and ""think"" (tests T, H, I, K), but settled on **""mount""** because:\n- It fits the pattern `_ _ _ N _`.\n- It tests new vowels (O, U) and consonants (M, T), which are common.\n- It avoids forbidden letters and reuses only the known \'N\' in position 4.\n\n<guess>mount</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: mount -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) U(✓) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the second guess ""mount"":\n M(x) -> M is not in the secret word.\n O(x) -> O is not in the secret word.\n U(✓) -> U is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since ""mount"" is m-o-u-n-t, so positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T).\n N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, which we already knew).\n T(x) -> T is not in the secret word.\n\n Therefore, we now know:\n - The secret word has the letter \'U\' in the 3rd position and \'N\' in the 4th position.\n - The letters M, O, T are not in the secret word (in addition to the previously known absent letters: C, R, A, E).\n\n So, absent letters: C, R, A, E, M, O, T.\n\n And we know the pattern: the word is _ _ U N _ \n\n We have to avoid using the absent letters: C, R, A, E, M, O, T.\n\n We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, U, T (from both guesses). \n So new letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We know the word must have a U in position 3 and N in position 4.\n\n So the pattern is: [letter1] [letter2] U N [letter5]\n\n We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only the available letters.\n\n We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, L, I, D, G, H, etc.\n\n Example words:\n - ""SHUNS"": S-H-U-N-S -> but U is in position 3? S(1), H(2), U(3), N(4), S(5). But we have two S\'s? And we don\'t know if S is in the word. However, we must avoid using T? T is absent, but S is allowed. But note: the feedback for ""mount"" didn\'t say anything about S. However, we haven\'t used S yet. But ""SHUNS"" has S at the end and beginning. Also, we are testing S twice? We might not want to test the same letter twice if we can avoid it, to maximize information.\n\n But we don\'t know if S is in the word. However, using two S\'s might not be efficient.\n\n Alternative: ""SHUNK"" -> S-H-U-N-K -> tests S, H, K. But K is less common.\n\n ""SHINY"" -> but we have to have U in position 3, so ""SHINY"" is S-H-I-N-Y -> position 3 is I, not U. So invalid.\n\n We must have U in position 3 and N in position 4.\n\n Another word: ""FLUNG"" -> F-L-U-N-G -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G. Letters: F, L, U, N, G. None of these are in the absent list. So that\'s a candidate.\n\n But we haven\'t tried F, L, G.\n\n Another: ""BLUNT"" -> but T is absent, so we cannot use T.\n\n ""CLUNG"" -> C is absent -> invalid.\n\n ""PLUNG"" -> P-L-U-N-G -> P, L, U, N, G. P and L are new. But note: we have to avoid C, R, A, E, M, O, T. P is allowed. So that\'s a candidate.\n\n ""SLUNG"" -> S-L-U-N-G -> S, L, U, N, G. S and L are common.\n\n Now, comparing:\n - ""FLUNG"": tests F, L, G\n - ""PLUNG"": tests P, L, G\n - ""SLUNG"": tests S, L, G\n\n We want to test the most common letters. S is more common than F or P.\n\n So ""SLUNG"" might be a good choice because it tests S (very common) and L (also common) and G.\n\n But note: we are also testing L in position 2 and G in position 5.\n\n Alternatively, we could test a word that includes a vowel? We haven\'t tried I or other vowels. The only vowels left are I and sometimes Y (as a vowel). We know A, E, O are absent, and U is present (but we know its position). So the word must have at least one vowel? Actually, U is a vowel, so we have one vowel. But there might be another vowel? For example, in the first or second position? We haven\'t tested I yet.\n\n We should test I because it\'s a common vowel.\n\n How about a word that has I in position 1 or 2? For example, ""SHUNT"" -> but T is absent. ""SHUNK"" -> no I. ""SWUNG"" -> S-W-U-N-G -> tests S, W, G. But no I.\n\n We can try ""BLIND"" -> but that doesn\'t have U in position 3.\n\n We must have U in position 3 and N in position 4.\n\n So the word must be: [letter1][letter2]UN[letter5]\n\n We can use I in position 1 or 2.\n\n Example: ""DIURN"" -> but that\'s not a common word? And it\'s 5 letters? D-I-U-R-N -> but R is absent, so we cannot use R.\n\n ""GIUNT"" -> not a word.\n\n ""QUINS"" -> Q-U-I-N-S -> but Q is followed by U? In this case, position 1: Q, 2: U? But we need U in position 3. So that doesn\'t work.\n\n ""BUILT"" -> B-U-I-L-T -> but U is in position 2, not 3.

 N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). (We already knew this)
 G(x) -> G is not in the word.

 Therefore, we now know:
 - The secret word starts with S, then L, then U, then N, and the last letter is not G.
 - Also, from previous feedback, we know that the last letter is not any of the absent letters: C, R, A, E, M, O, T, and now also G.

 So the pattern is: S L U N [last letter]

 We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""SLUN"" and the last letter is not in the absent list (C, R, A, E, M, O, T, G) and not S, L, U, N (since those are already in the word, but they could be repeated? However, we don't have any indication of repeated letters so far, but we cannot assume).

 However, note that the feedback for ""slung"" had G as absent, but that doesn't mean the last letter cannot be S, L, U, or N? But if it were S, for example, then we would have two S's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 But let's look at the feedback: for ""slung"", we have S, L, U, N all correct and G absent. So the last letter is missing and must be one of the remaining letters.

 The word is ""SLUN"" + ?

 We have to consider that the last letter could be a letter that we haven't tried and is not absent.

 The absent letters are: C, R, A, E, M, O, T, G.

 We have used: C, R, A, E, M, O, T, G, S, L, U, N (from all guesses).

 So the remaining letters are: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Now, we need to find a word that is ""SLUN"" + one of these letters? But is there any English word that starts with ""SLUN""?

 Let me think: 
 - ""slunk"": but K is in the remaining letters? Yes, and we haven't tried K. But note: ""slunk"" is a word (past tense of slink). 
 - ""slung"": we already tried and G is absent, so the last letter is not G.

 So ""slunk"" is a candidate: S-L-U-N-K.

 But we must check if K is allowed: yes, because it's not in the absent list.

 Are there other words? 
 - ""slurb""? not a word.
 - ""slurp"": S-L-U-R-P -> but R is absent (from guess1: R(x)), so we cannot use R.
 - ""slush"": S-L-U-S-H -> but S is repeated? And H is allowed. However, the pattern is S L U N _, so the fourth letter must be N, but in ""slush"" it's S at position 4? No, ""slush"" is S-L-U-S-H -> positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:U, 4:S, 5:H. But we need position 4 to be N. So that doesn't work.

 Another: ""slurp"" has R which is absent and also no N in position 4.

 Actually, the only common word I can think of that fits ""SLUN_"" is ""slunk"".

 What about ""slunt""? Not a common word, and T is absent.

 ""slurp"" is invalid because of R and no N.

 So ""slunk"" seems to be the only common word.

 But let me confirm: 
 - ""slunk"": past tense of slink, meaning to move stealthily.

 Also, we have not tried K, so it's a new letter.

 Therefore, we can guess ""slunk"".

 But note: we are not sure if there are other words. However, given the constraints, ""slunk"" is the most likely.

 Alternatively, if we are wrong, we get feedback and then we can adjust.

 But let's see: the word must be ""SLUN"" + a letter that is not absent and not G. The only common word is ""slunk"".

 So I'll go with ""slunk"".Based on the feedback:
- **Correct positions confirmed**:
  - 1st: **S** (from ""slung"" feedback: S✓)
  - 2nd: **L** (from ""slung"" feedback: L✓)
  - 3rd: **U** (from ""mount"" and ""slung"" feedback: U✓)
  - 4th: **N** (from all previous feedback: N✓)
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, M, O, T, G (from all feedback).
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `S L U N ?`, where the last letter is unknown but must be a letter not in the absent list.

Given the pattern `SLUN?`:
- The only common English word fitting this pattern is **""slunk""** (past tense of ""slink"").
- The last letter **K** is not in the absent list and hasn't been tested yet.

This guess resolves the word if correct or provides critical information about the final letter.

<guess>slunk</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we have:

- **Correct letters in known positions**:
  - Position 1: **S** (from ""slung"" feedback: S✓)
  - Position 2: **L** (from ""slung"" feedback: L✓)
  - Position 3: **U** (from ""mount"" and ""slung"" feedback: U✓)
  - Position 4: **N** (from all guesses: N✓)
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, M, O, T, G (eliminated from feedback).
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `S L U N ?`, where the last letter is unknown.

The only common English word fitting this pattern is **""slunk""** (past tense of ""slink""). The final letter **K** is untested and not in the absent list, making this the logical next guess.

<guess>slunk</guess>",slunk,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""slung"":
 S(✓) -> S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
 L(✓) -> L is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
 U(✓) -> U is in the word and in the correct position (position 3). (We already knew this, but now confirmed)
 N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). (We already knew this)
 G(x) -> G is not in the word.

 Therefore, we now know:
 - The secret word starts with S, then L, then U, then N, and the last letter is not G.
 - Also, from previous feedback, we know that the last letter is not any of the absent letters: C, R, A, E, M, O, T, and now also G.

 So the pattern is: S L U N [last letter]

 We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""SLUN"" and the last letter is not in the absent list (C, R, A, E, M, O, T, G) and not S, L, U, N (since those are already in the word, but they could be repeated? However, we don't have any indication of repeated letters so far, but we cannot assume).

 However, note that the feedback for ""slung"" had G as absent, but that doesn't mean the last letter cannot be S, L, U, or N? But if it were S, for example, then we would have two S's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 But let's look at the feedback: for ""slung"", we have S, L, U, N all correct and G absent. So the last letter is missing and must be one of the remaining letters.

 The word is ""SLUN"" + ?

 We have to consider that the last letter could be a letter that we haven't tried and is not absent.

 The absent letters are: C, R, A, E, M, O, T, G.

 We have used: C, R, A, E, M, O, T, G, S, L, U, N (from all guesses).

 So the remaining letters are: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Now, we need to find a word that is ""SLUN"" + one of these letters? But is there any English word that starts with ""SLUN""?

 Let me think: 
 - ""slunk"": but K is in the remaining letters? Yes, and we haven't tried K. But note: ""slunk"" is a word (past tense of slink). 
 - ""slung"": we already tried and G is absent, so the last letter is not G.

 So ""slunk"" is a candidate: S-L-U-N-K.

 But we must check if K is allowed: yes, because it's not in the absent list.

 Are there other words? 
 - ""slurb""? not a word.
 - ""slurp"": S-L-U-R-P -> but R is absent (from guess1: R(x)), so we cannot use R.
 - ""slush"": S-L-U-S-H -> but S is repeated? And H is allowed. However, the pattern is S L U N _, so the fourth letter must be N, but in ""slush"" it's S at position 4? No, ""slush"" is S-L-U-S-H -> positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:U, 4:S, 5:H. But we need position 4 to be N. So that doesn't work.

 Another: ""slurp"" has R which is absent and also no N in position 4.

 Actually, the only common word I can think of that fits ""SLUN_"" is ""slunk"".

 What about ""slunt""? Not a common word, and T is absent.

 ""slurp"" is invalid because of R and no N.

 So ""slunk"" seems to be the only common word.

 But let me confirm: 
 - ""slunk"": past tense of slink, meaning to move stealthily.

 Also, we have not tried K, so it's a new letter.

 Therefore, we can guess ""slunk"".

 But note: we are not sure if there are other words. However, given the constraints, ""slunk"" is the most likely.

 Alternatively, if we are wrong, we get feedback and then we can adjust.

 But let's see: the word must be ""SLUN"" + a letter that is not absent and not G. The only common word is ""slunk"".

 So I'll go with ""slunk"".Based on the feedback:
- **Correct positions confirmed**:
  - 1st: **S** (from ""slung"" feedback: S✓)
  - 2nd: **L** (from ""slung"" feedback: L✓)
  - 3rd: **U** (from ""mount"" and ""slung"" feedback: U✓)
  - 4th: **N** (from all previous feedback: N✓)
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, M, O, T, G (from all feedback).
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `S L U N ?`, where the last letter is unknown but must be a letter not in the absent list.

Given the pattern `SLUN?`:
- The only common English word fitting this pattern is **""slunk""** (past tense of ""slink"").
- The last letter **K** is not in the absent list and hasn't been tested yet.

This guess resolves the word if correct or provides critical information about the final letter.
