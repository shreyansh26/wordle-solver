We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word in Wordle. It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)

This tells us:
1. The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
2. The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Ends with E (since we know position 5 is E)
- Does not contain C, R, A, N (since they are absent)
- Includes other common letters to get more information.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Let's think of words ending with E that avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

Common letters we might try: S, T, L, O, U, D, G, H, I, etc.

We can try to use a word that has as many new letters as possible to maximize information.

One common strategy is to try a word that includes common vowels and consonants we haven't tried yet.

We know the word has an E at the end. We haven't tried the vowels: O, I, U (A is already excluded). Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to form a word ending with E.

Possible words: 
- We could try ""SLATE"", but S, L, T are new, but note: A is excluded (from feedback: A is not in the word). So ""SLATE"" is invalid because it contains A.

We must avoid A.

Another idea: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E. This avoids C, R, A, N.

But let's check: 
- S, P, I, T are new, and E is at the end.

Alternatively, ""SHINE"" -> but H, I, N: but N is excluded (feedback: N not in word). So ""SHINE"" is invalid.

""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E. Avoids C, R, A, N. This seems good.

""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E. Also avoids the excluded letters.

We want to cover more vowels. We haven't tried O, I, U. So ""STOLE"" has O, which is a vowel we haven't tested.

But note: we also want to test common consonants. Another popular choice might be ""POISE"", but that ends with E and has O, I, S. However, P, O, I, S, E. This is also valid.

But we must avoid A and N, which we are.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has the E at the end and uses as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some words ending with E that don't contain C, R, A, N:
- BIBLE -> but B, I, B, L, E -> has two B's, which might not be ideal for information.
- TITLE -> T, I, T, L, E -> two T's.
- STOLE: S, T, O, L, E -> all unique letters.
- POISE: P, O, I, S, E -> all unique.
- QUITE: Q, U, I, T, E -> but Q is less common and U is a vowel we haven't tried.

We might prefer to test more common letters.

Another idea: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. This has two vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (H, S). But note: we know E is at the end, so we are testing H, O, U, S.

This seems good because we get to test O and U, which are vowels.

But we must avoid A, which we are, and also R, C, N.

So ""HOUSE"" is a candidate.

Alternatively, ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E.

Or ""DOUSE"" -> D, O, U, S, E.

But let's consider: we have only one E and it's at the end. We don't know if there are other E's, but the feedback only showed the last E as correct. However, it's possible that there are other E's? But the feedback for the other positions didn't show E, but in ""crane"", the E was at the end and correct. The other positions didn't have E, but that doesn't mean the word doesn't have another E. However, in the feedback, if there were another E, and we had placed it in the wrong position, it would have shown as '-'. But in ""crane"", we only had E at the end and it was correct, and the other letters were absent. So we don't know about other E's.

But note: the feedback for the first four letters were all 'x', meaning they are not in the word. So the word does not have C, R, A, N. And the E at the end is present. But we don't know if there is another E.

However, in our next guess, we can try to test for other E's? But we are forced to put E at the end. So we can only test for E in other positions by putting it in a different position? But we know the last position is E, so we must have E at the end in every guess? Actually, no. We can put E in a different position to see if there is a double E? But the feedback told us that the last letter is E, so we know that at least the last letter is E. But if we put E in another position, we might get information about whether there is another E.

However, in the next guess, we are allowed to put E in a different position? But we know that the last letter is E, so if we don't put E at the end, we are wasting the known position. It's better to use the known E at the end to free up other positions for new letters.

So I think we should keep E at the end and try new letters in the first four positions.

Therefore, we should choose a word that ends with E and uses four new letters (not C, R, A, N, and also not repeating letters unnecessarily).

We have 26 letters minus 5 we know (C, R, A, N, and we know E is in, but we are using E at the end) so we have 21 letters left. But we are using E, so we can choose from the other 20 (excluding C, R, A, N, and E? But E is allowed again? Actually, the word might have multiple E's, so we can use E again? But in our guess, we can use E again to test if there is a double E? However, in the first guess, we only had one E and it was at the end. If we put an E in the middle and it is present, then we know there is another E. But if we don't, we might not know.

But to maximize information, it's better to use all new letters. So we avoid repeating E for now.

So we want a word that ends with E, and the first four letters are new (not C, R, A, N) and not E? Actually, we can use E again? But let's avoid for now to get more information.

So the word should have four new letters in positions 1-4 and E at position 5.

We have many options.

Let me list some words:
- BITE: B, I, T, E -> but only 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So 5-letter words.

5-letter words ending with E, without C, R, A, N.

Examples:
- ""BIBLE"" -> but has two B's -> not ideal.
- ""TITLE"" -> two T's.
- ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E -> all unique.
- ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> all unique.
- ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> unique, but Q is uncommon.
- ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> all unique.
- ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> unique.
- ""DOUSE"" -> D, O, U, S, E -> unique.
- ""LOUSE"" -> L, O, U, S, E -> unique, but same as above with L.

We also have ""SLIME"", but S, L, I, M, E -> but we must avoid A? Yes, and it doesn't have A. But note: we don't know if the word has S, L, I, M. But we are testing them.

But ""SLIME"" is valid.

However, we want to test vowels. We haven't tested O, I, U. So words with O, I, U are good.

""HOUSE"" has O and U.

""POISE"" has O and I.

Which one to choose?

We can also consider the frequency of letters.

In English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A and N are out, so we focus on T, O, I, S.

We have not tried T, O, I, S, etc.

So ""TOISE"" is not a word. ""POISE"" is a word.

""HOUSE"" is a very common word.

Another one: ""SUITE"" -> S, U, I, T, E -> but that has U, I, T, S. This is also good.

But let's pick one.

I think ""HOUSE"" is a good choice because it tests H, O, U, S, and we know E is at the end.

So I'll go with ""HOUSE"".

But note: we are not forced to use the known E at the end? Actually, we can, and it's beneficial because if we get a ✓ for E again, we know it's fixed. But we already know it's fixed. However, if we don't put E at the end, then we might get feedback that E is in the word but in the wrong position? But we know it should be at the end. So it's better to use it at the end to avoid confusion and to get information about the other positions.

So I think ""HOUSE"" is a solid second guess.

Therefore, my second guess is ""HOUSE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Ensure the word ends with E (to leverage the known correct position).
2. Avoid using C, R, A, or N (since they are absent from the secret word).
3. Introduce new, common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., testing vowels like O, U, I and consonants like S, T, H).

A strong candidate is ""HOUSE"":
- It ends with E, satisfying the known position.
- It uses new letters (H, O, U, S) that haven't been tested yet.
- It covers two vowels (O, U) and common consonants (H, S), which could help reveal more about the secret word.

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)

This tells us:
1. The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
2. The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Ends with E (since we know position 5 is E)
- Does not contain C, R, A, N (since they are absent)
- Includes other common letters to get more information.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Let's think of words ending with E that avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

Common letters we might try: S, T, L, O, U, D, G, H, I, etc.

We can try to use a word that has as many new letters as possible to maximize information.

One common strategy is to try a word that includes common vowels and consonants we haven't tried yet.

We know the word has an E at the end. We haven't tried the vowels: O, I, U (A is already excluded). Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to form a word ending with E.

Possible words: 
- We could try ""SLATE"", but S, L, T are new, but note: A is excluded (from feedback: A is not in the word). So ""SLATE"" is invalid because it contains A.

We must avoid A.

Another idea: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E. This avoids C, R, A, N.

But let's check: 
- S, P, I, T are new, and E is at the end.

Alternatively, ""SHINE"" -> but H, I, N: but N is excluded (feedback: N not in word). So ""SHINE"" is invalid.

""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E. Avoids C, R, A, N. This seems good.

""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E. Also avoids the excluded letters.

We want to cover more vowels. We haven't tried O, I, U. So ""STOLE"" has O, which is a vowel we haven't tested.

But note: we also want to test common consonants. Another popular choice might be ""POISE"", but that ends with E and has O, I, S. However, P, O, I, S, E. This is also valid.

But we must avoid A and N, which we are.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has the E at the end and uses as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some words ending with E that don't contain C, R, A, N:
- BIBLE -> but B, I, B, L, E -> has two B's, which might not be ideal for information.
- TITLE -> T, I, T, L, E -> two T's.
- STOLE: S, T, O, L, E -> all unique letters.
- POISE: P, O, I, S, E -> all unique.
- QUITE: Q, U, I, T, E -> but Q is less common and U is a vowel we haven't tried.

We might prefer to test more common letters.

Another idea: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. This has two vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (H, S). But note: we know E is at the end, so we are testing H, O, U, S.

This seems good because we get to test O and U, which are vowels.

But we must avoid A, which we are, and also R, C, N.

So ""HOUSE"" is a candidate.

Alternatively, ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E.

Or ""DOUSE"" -> D, O, U, S, E.

But let's consider: we have only one E and it's at the end. We don't know if there are other E's, but the feedback only showed the last E as correct. However, it's possible that there are other E's? But the feedback for the other positions didn't show E, but in ""crane"", the E was at the end and correct. The other positions didn't have E, but that doesn't mean the word doesn't have another E. However, in the feedback, if there were another E, and we had placed it in the wrong position, it would have shown as '-'. But in ""crane"", we only had E at the end and it was correct, and the other letters were absent. So we don't know about other E's.

But note: the feedback for the first four letters were all 'x', meaning they are not in the word. So the word does not have C, R, A, N. And the E at the end is present. But we don't know if there is another E.

However, in our next guess, we can try to test for other E's? But we are forced to put E at the end. So we can only test for E in other positions by putting it in a different position? But we know the last position is E, so we must have E at the end in every guess? Actually, no. We can put E in a different position to see if there is a double E? But the feedback told us that the last letter is E, so we know that at least the last letter is E. But if we put E in another position, we might get information about whether there is another E.

However, in the next guess, we are allowed to put E in a different position? But we know that the last letter is E, so if we don't put E at the end, we are wasting the known position. It's better to use the known E at the end to free up other positions for new letters.

So I think we should keep E at the end and try new letters in the first four positions.

Therefore, we should choose a word that ends with E and uses four new letters (not C, R, A, N, and also not repeating letters unnecessarily).

We have 26 letters minus 5 we know (C, R, A, N, and we know E is in, but we are using E at the end) so we have 21 letters left. But we are using E, so we can choose from the other 20 (excluding C, R, A, N, and E? But E is allowed again? Actually, the word might have multiple E's, so we can use E again? But in our guess, we can use E again to test if there is a double E? However, in the first guess, we only had one E and it was at the end. If we put an E in the middle and it is present, then we know there is another E. But if we don't, we might not know.

But to maximize information, it's better to use all new letters. So we avoid repeating E for now.

So we want a word that ends with E, and the first four letters are new (not C, R, A, N) and not E? Actually, we can use E again? But let's avoid for now to get more information.

So the word should have four new letters in positions 1-4 and E at position 5.

We have many options.

Let me list some words:
- BITE: B, I, T, E -> but only 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So 5-letter words.

5-letter words ending with E, without C, R, A, N.

Examples:
- ""BIBLE"" -> but has two B's -> not ideal.
- ""TITLE"" -> two T's.
- ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E -> all unique.
- ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> all unique.
- ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> unique, but Q is uncommon.
- ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> all unique.
- ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> unique.
- ""DOUSE"" -> D, O, U, S, E -> unique.
- ""LOUSE"" -> L, O, U, S, E -> unique, but same as above with L.

We also have ""SLIME"", but S, L, I, M, E -> but we must avoid A? Yes, and it doesn't have A. But note: we don't know if the word has S, L, I, M. But we are testing them.

But ""SLIME"" is valid.

However, we want to test vowels. We haven't tested O, I, U. So words with O, I, U are good.

""HOUSE"" has O and U.

""POISE"" has O and I.

Which one to choose?

We can also consider the frequency of letters.

In English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A and N are out, so we focus on T, O, I, S.

We have not tried T, O, I, S, etc.

So ""TOISE"" is not a word. ""POISE"" is a word.

""HOUSE"" is a very common word.

Another one: ""SUITE"" -> S, U, I, T, E -> but that has U, I, T, S. This is also good.

But let's pick one.

I think ""HOUSE"" is a good choice because it tests H, O, U, S, and we know E is at the end.

So I'll go with ""HOUSE"".

But note: we are not forced to use the known E at the end? Actually, we can, and it's beneficial because if we get a ✓ for E again, we know it's fixed. But we already know it's fixed. However, if we don't put E at the end, then we might get feedback that E is in the word but in the wrong position? But we know it should be at the end. So it's better to use it at the end to avoid confusion and to get information about the other positions.

So I think ""HOUSE"" is a solid second guess.

Therefore, my second guess is ""HOUSE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Ensure the word ends with E (to leverage the known correct position).
2. Avoid using C, R, A, or N (since they are absent from the secret word).
3. Introduce new, common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., testing vowels like O, U, I and consonants like S, T, H).

A strong candidate is ""HOUSE"":
- It ends with E, satisfying the known position.
- It uses new letters (H, O, U, S) that haven't been tested yet.
- It covers two vowels (O, U) and common consonants (H, S), which could help reveal more about the secret word.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
   - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
   - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

2. ""house"": H(x) O(x) U(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is again correctly placed at position 5 (confirming this).
   - H, O, S are not in the word.
   - U is in the word but not in the position guessed (position 3).

So we know:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- U is present in the word, but not at position 3.
- We have eliminated these letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S.

The letters that are in the word: We know E and U are in the word, and possibly others.

Now, we need to make a third guess. The word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E

U is in the word but not at position 3. So U must be at position 1, 2, or 4.

We need to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Includes U in position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S.
- Uses new letters to get more information.

We have eliminated consonants H, S and vowels O. We haven't tested other common vowels (I) and consonants (like T, L, P, M, D, G, etc.).

Given that U is present, we should try to determine its position by placing it in different locations.

Possible positions for U: 1, 2, or 4.

We should also test other common letters. Since the word has U and E, it might have other common letters.

We need a word using only available letters and including U and E.

Available letters: all except C, R, A, N, H, O, S. So avoid these.

Word pattern: positions 1-4: any letter except C,R,A,N,H,O,S. Position 5: E.

And U must be in one of positions 1,2,4.

Now, what words fit this?

Let me think of 5-letter words ending in E, containing U, and excluding C,R,A,N,H,O,S.

Possible words:
- ""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E -> but Q might be rare and we haven't eliminated Q.
  - However, we are avoiding S (which is eliminated), but S is not in QUITE.
- ""SUITE"": but S is eliminated, so not allowed (because S is not in the word).
- ""GLUED"": G,L,U,E,D -> ends with E? No, it ends with D. So not.
  - We need a word ending with E.

Actually, ""GLUE"" is only 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Let's list:
- ""BLUES"": But S is eliminated, so we avoid S.
- ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> E at end, and has U. But does it avoid eliminated letters? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So F,L,U,K are new, S not used. So yes.
- ""FLUTE"": F,L,U,T,E -> similar.
- ""JUICE"": J,U,I,C,E -> but C is eliminated, cannot use C.
- ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> but O and R and N are eliminated, so no.
- ""POULE"": but I think P,O? O is eliminated.

We should avoid O as well.

So words without C,R,A,N,H,O,S.

Let me try to generate words:

- With U: and ending in E.

Examples:
- ""LUCRE"": but R is eliminated -> not allowed.
- ""DUVET"": D,U,V,E,T -> but does it end with E? DUVET ends with T? No, D-U-V-E-T -> last letter is T? Actually, DUVET is 5 letters: D-U-V-E-T? But ""duvet"" ends with T, so not ending with E.

Proper words:
- ""ABUSE"": but A is eliminated.
- ""AMUSE"": but A is eliminated.
- ""BLUED"": B,L,U,E,D -> but ends with D? No, but if present tense, ""blue"" is 4 letters. ""Blued"" would be past tense, meaning made blue, but it ends with D, not E.

We need a word that naturally ends with E and has U.

Common possibilities:
- ""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> yes! Ends with E, and has U at position 3? Positions: P(1), L(2), U(3), M(4), E(5). But from guess 2, U is in the word but not in position 3. So if I put U at position 3 again, it would be wrong? Yes, in ""house"", U was at position 3 and it was wrong position. So in the secret word, U is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""PLUME"", U is at position 3 again, which we know is incorrect, so this word would have U in position 3, which is a bad guess because we know U is not at position 3. We should avoid putting U at position 3.

So we need a word with U at position 1, 2, or 4.

Position 1: U _ _ _ E
Examples: USAGE (but S and A eliminated), UNABLE (A and N eliminated), etc. Not many.

Position 2: _ U _ _ E
Examples: QUITE (Q,U,I,T,E), or BUTTE (but B,U,T,T,E? and T repeated), or FUTILE (too long? 6 letters). ""QUIET"" ends with T? No. ""QUITE"" is good: Q,U,I,T,E -> letters: Q,U,I,T,E, all not eliminated? C,R,A,N,H,O,S eliminated, so Q,U,I,T,E are all available. E is used at end, but we are testing with E at end.

Position 4: _ _ _ U E
Examples: ARGUE (A eliminated), VAGUE (A eliminated), PIQUE (P,I,Q,U,E), or toQUE (ends with UE? ""TOQUE"" is a hat, but it ends with E? Actually, ""toque"" is spelled T-O-Q-U-E? That's 5 letters: T, O, Q, U, E. But O is eliminated? In ""toque"", position 2 is O, which we cannot use because O is not in the word. So we avoid O.

Another: CLOUE? Not a word.

Better: ""GLUTE"" -> glute muscles? But ""glute"" is typically ""glutes"" plural? Also, G,L,U,T,E -> positions: G(1), L(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But U is at position 3? And we know U is not at position 3? ""GLUTE"" would have U at position 3, which we should avoid.

So we must avoid U at position 3.

So for position 2: _ U _ _ E
Words: QUITE (Q,U,I,T,E) -> this works? But Q is not common. Another: ""DUVET"" doesn't end with E? ""DUVET"" ends with T.

What about ""SUITE""? But S is eliminated.

""BUYER"" ends with R? Not E.

""JUICE"" has C? C is eliminated.

""QUILT"" ends with T? No.

Another: ""LUCKY"" doesn't end with E.

Let me think: Valid words for position 2: U at 2.
- Maybe ""MUTED"": M,U,T,E,D -> ends with D? No, but ""muted"" is M-U-T-E-D, so E in position 4? Then ends with D. Not E at end.

We need the word to end with E.

Perhaps: ""PAUSE"" but P,A,U,S,E -> A and S eliminated.

So difficult without position 3 U.

Another for position 4: _ _ _ U E
Words: ""ENSUE"" -> E,N,S,U,E but N and S eliminated and also E at position 1? But we don't know about E at beginning. However, E at position 1? But in ""crane"", E was at 5 and we had C,R,A,N at other positions? But we don't know if E appears elsewhere.

Possible word: ""issue"" but ends with E? I-S-S-U-E? Has S eliminated.

Let's try: ""PIQUE"" -> P,I,Q,U,E -> positions: P(1), I(2), Q(3), U(4), E(5). This fits: U at position 4, and ends with E, and letters: P, I, Q, U, E. Are they eliminated? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So P,I,Q,U,E are all okay? E is used at end.

Q is a less common letter, but it's acceptable.

Another possibility: ""BIQUE""? Not a word.

""TOQUE"" has O.

So ""PIQUE"" might work.

Position 1: U _ _ _ E
Words: ""USUAL"" doesn't end with E? Or ""URBAN"" doesn't end with E? How about ""UNCLE"" -> U,N,C,L,E -> N and C eliminated. ""UNLIT"" ends with T? No.

Another: ""UTILE"": U,T,I,L,E -> positions: U(1), T(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). This word? Yes, ""utile"" means useful. So U,T,I,L,E. Avoids eliminated letters? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So U,T,I,L,E are all allowed. And U is at position 1.

Similarly, ""UNITE"" -> U,N,I,T,E -> N eliminated? Yes, N is eliminated.

So ""UTILE"" or ""PIQUE"".

Now, which one to choose? We want to test new letters.

In ""PIQUE"": letters P, I, Q, U, E. We already know U and E are in the word. So we are testing P, I, Q.

In ""UTILE"": letters U,T,I,L,E. We know U and E, so testing T, I, L.

Comparing:
- ""PIQUE"": introduces P, I, Q -> Q is infrequent, so likely less information except for Q. P and I are more common.
- ""UTILE"": introduces T, I, L -> T and L are very common letters.

Also, we have not tested I (a vowel) yet, so testing I is good.

But both ""UTILE"" and ""PIQUE"" test I.

""UTILE"" tests T and L, which are more common than Q and P.

Moreover, in ""UTILE"", U is at position 1, which we are testing.

We also have not tested L or T.

Therefore, ""UTILE"" seems better because it tests more common letters.

But earlier we have avoided Q.

Another word: ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> positions: G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). This avoids position 3 for U? Wait, U is at position 2? So in ""GUILE"", U is at position 2.

Is that acceptable? Yes, we need U at 1,2, or 4.

So ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E.

Letters: G,U,I,L,E. Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S -> G,U,I,L,E are all okay.

Similarly, ""BUILD"" ends with D? Not E.

So ""GUILE"" is a word.

Also, ""GUISE"" but S eliminated.

""GUILE"" is good.

Now, compare ""UTILE"" (U at 1) and ""GUILE"" (U at 2).

We have position flexibility.

Another one: ""FLUME"" but U at position 3? F,L,U,M,E -> U at 3, which we avoid.

""PLUMB"" not ending with E.

""DUCHY"" doesn't end with E.

Back to available words:
- Position 2: _ U _ _ E: ""QUITE"" (with Q), ""GUILE"" (G,U,I,L,E)
- Position 1: U _ _ _ E: ""UTILE"" (U,T,I,L,E)
- Position 4: _ _ _ U E: ""PIQUE"" (P,I,Q,U,E)

We could also consider ""SUGAR"" but doesn't end with E and S eliminated.

I think ""UTILE"" and ""GUILE"" are better options.

Let's choose between ""UTILE"" and ""GUILE"".

Both introduce T, I, L and G, I, L respectively? ""UTILE"": U,T,I,L,E -> tests T, I, L. ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> tests G, I, L.

So UTILE tests T and the others, GUILE tests G and L/I.

We haven't tested T, L, G, I.

I is a vowel and important to test.

Also, L and T are common consonants.

To decide, we can consider frequency. T is more common than G.

Also, by testing T, we might get more information.

Similarly, G is less common than T.

Therefore, perhaps ""UTILE"" is better because it uses the more common T.

We could think of other words: for example, ""TIMED"" wouldn't work because M,E,D? Positions: but ends with D? No.

Another word with U: ""BEIGE"" doesn't have U.

List:
- ""QUITE"": Q is less common.
- ""PIQUE"": Q again.
- ""GUILE"": G is acceptable, but less common than T.

So ""UTILE"": U, T, I, L, E.

Or ""CUTIE"" but C eliminated.

Therefore, I think ""UTILE"" is a good choice: uses new letters T, I, L (common) and has U at position 1 and E at 5.

So we guess ""UTILE"".

But note: in ""UTILE"", U is at position 1. We don't know if that is correct, but we are testing.

Also, if U is not at 1, then it must be at 2 or 4.

By putting U at 1, we can confirm or eliminate that position.

Similarly, we get information about T, I, L.

Therefore, let's go with ""UTILE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is correctly placed at position 5 (E(✓)), and C, R, A, N are absent (x). So the secret word ends with E and excludes C, R, A, N.
- **Guess 2 (house)**: E is confirmed at position 5 (E(✓)), U is present but not at position 3 (U(-)), and H, O, S are absent (x). This means U is in the secret word but must be at position 1, 2, or 4 (since it's not at 3), and H, O, S are excluded.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (position 5).
- U must be included at position 1, 2, or 4 (avoiding position 3).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S (all absent based on feedback).
- Focus on testing new common letters (e.g., vowels like I and consonants like T, L, D) to maximize information.

Considering these constraints:
- **UTILE** fits: U in position 1 (testing if U is at start), T in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, E in position 5.
- All letters are eligible: U (known present), T, I, L are new (not excluded), and E is fixed at position 5.
- This tests U at a different position (position 1) and introduces common consonants (T, L) and the vowel (I) for broader coverage.

Alternative words like GUILE (U at position 2) or PIQUE (U at position 4 with rare Q) were considered, but UTILE uses the more common letters T and L over G/Q.

<guess>utile</guess>",utile,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
   - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
   - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

2. ""house"": H(x) O(x) U(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is again correctly placed at position 5 (confirming this).
   - H, O, S are not in the word.
   - U is in the word but not in the position guessed (position 3).

So we know:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- U is present in the word, but not at position 3.
- We have eliminated these letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S.

The letters that are in the word: We know E and U are in the word, and possibly others.

Now, we need to make a third guess. The word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E

U is in the word but not at position 3. So U must be at position 1, 2, or 4.

We need to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Includes U in position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S.
- Uses new letters to get more information.

We have eliminated consonants H, S and vowels O. We haven't tested other common vowels (I) and consonants (like T, L, P, M, D, G, etc.).

Given that U is present, we should try to determine its position by placing it in different locations.

Possible positions for U: 1, 2, or 4.

We should also test other common letters. Since the word has U and E, it might have other common letters.

We need a word using only available letters and including U and E.

Available letters: all except C, R, A, N, H, O, S. So avoid these.

Word pattern: positions 1-4: any letter except C,R,A,N,H,O,S. Position 5: E.

And U must be in one of positions 1,2,4.

Now, what words fit this?

Let me think of 5-letter words ending in E, containing U, and excluding C,R,A,N,H,O,S.

Possible words:
- ""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E -> but Q might be rare and we haven't eliminated Q.
  - However, we are avoiding S (which is eliminated), but S is not in QUITE.
- ""SUITE"": but S is eliminated, so not allowed (because S is not in the word).
- ""GLUED"": G,L,U,E,D -> ends with E? No, it ends with D. So not.
  - We need a word ending with E.

Actually, ""GLUE"" is only 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Let's list:
- ""BLUES"": But S is eliminated, so we avoid S.
- ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> E at end, and has U. But does it avoid eliminated letters? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So F,L,U,K are new, S not used. So yes.
- ""FLUTE"": F,L,U,T,E -> similar.
- ""JUICE"": J,U,I,C,E -> but C is eliminated, cannot use C.
- ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> but O and R and N are eliminated, so no.
- ""POULE"": but I think P,O? O is eliminated.

We should avoid O as well.

So words without C,R,A,N,H,O,S.

Let me try to generate words:

- With U: and ending in E.

Examples:
- ""LUCRE"": but R is eliminated -> not allowed.
- ""DUVET"": D,U,V,E,T -> but does it end with E? DUVET ends with T? No, D-U-V-E-T -> last letter is T? Actually, DUVET is 5 letters: D-U-V-E-T? But ""duvet"" ends with T, so not ending with E.

Proper words:
- ""ABUSE"": but A is eliminated.
- ""AMUSE"": but A is eliminated.
- ""BLUED"": B,L,U,E,D -> but ends with D? No, but if present tense, ""blue"" is 4 letters. ""Blued"" would be past tense, meaning made blue, but it ends with D, not E.

We need a word that naturally ends with E and has U.

Common possibilities:
- ""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> yes! Ends with E, and has U at position 3? Positions: P(1), L(2), U(3), M(4), E(5). But from guess 2, U is in the word but not in position 3. So if I put U at position 3 again, it would be wrong? Yes, in ""house"", U was at position 3 and it was wrong position. So in the secret word, U is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""PLUME"", U is at position 3 again, which we know is incorrect, so this word would have U in position 3, which is a bad guess because we know U is not at position 3. We should avoid putting U at position 3.

So we need a word with U at position 1, 2, or 4.

Position 1: U _ _ _ E
Examples: USAGE (but S and A eliminated), UNABLE (A and N eliminated), etc. Not many.

Position 2: _ U _ _ E
Examples: QUITE (Q,U,I,T,E), or BUTTE (but B,U,T,T,E? and T repeated), or FUTILE (too long? 6 letters). ""QUIET"" ends with T? No. ""QUITE"" is good: Q,U,I,T,E -> letters: Q,U,I,T,E, all not eliminated? C,R,A,N,H,O,S eliminated, so Q,U,I,T,E are all available. E is used at end, but we are testing with E at end.

Position 4: _ _ _ U E
Examples: ARGUE (A eliminated), VAGUE (A eliminated), PIQUE (P,I,Q,U,E), or toQUE (ends with UE? ""TOQUE"" is a hat, but it ends with E? Actually, ""toque"" is spelled T-O-Q-U-E? That's 5 letters: T, O, Q, U, E. But O is eliminated? In ""toque"", position 2 is O, which we cannot use because O is not in the word. So we avoid O.

Another: CLOUE? Not a word.

Better: ""GLUTE"" -> glute muscles? But ""glute"" is typically ""glutes"" plural? Also, G,L,U,T,E -> positions: G(1), L(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But U is at position 3? And we know U is not at position 3? ""GLUTE"" would have U at position 3, which we should avoid.

So we must avoid U at position 3.

So for position 2: _ U _ _ E
Words: QUITE (Q,U,I,T,E) -> this works? But Q is not common. Another: ""DUVET"" doesn't end with E? ""DUVET"" ends with T.

What about ""SUITE""? But S is eliminated.

""BUYER"" ends with R? Not E.

""JUICE"" has C? C is eliminated.

""QUILT"" ends with T? No.

Another: ""LUCKY"" doesn't end with E.

Let me think: Valid words for position 2: U at 2.
- Maybe ""MUTED"": M,U,T,E,D -> ends with D? No, but ""muted"" is M-U-T-E-D, so E in position 4? Then ends with D. Not E at end.

We need the word to end with E.

Perhaps: ""PAUSE"" but P,A,U,S,E -> A and S eliminated.

So difficult without position 3 U.

Another for position 4: _ _ _ U E
Words: ""ENSUE"" -> E,N,S,U,E but N and S eliminated and also E at position 1? But we don't know about E at beginning. However, E at position 1? But in ""crane"", E was at 5 and we had C,R,A,N at other positions? But we don't know if E appears elsewhere.

Possible word: ""issue"" but ends with E? I-S-S-U-E? Has S eliminated.

Let's try: ""PIQUE"" -> P,I,Q,U,E -> positions: P(1), I(2), Q(3), U(4), E(5). This fits: U at position 4, and ends with E, and letters: P, I, Q, U, E. Are they eliminated? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So P,I,Q,U,E are all okay? E is used at end.

Q is a less common letter, but it's acceptable.

Another possibility: ""BIQUE""? Not a word.

""TOQUE"" has O.

So ""PIQUE"" might work.

Position 1: U _ _ _ E
Words: ""USUAL"" doesn't end with E? Or ""URBAN"" doesn't end with E? How about ""UNCLE"" -> U,N,C,L,E -> N and C eliminated. ""UNLIT"" ends with T? No.

Another: ""UTILE"": U,T,I,L,E -> positions: U(1), T(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). This word? Yes, ""utile"" means useful. So U,T,I,L,E. Avoids eliminated letters? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So U,T,I,L,E are all allowed. And U is at position 1.

Similarly, ""UNITE"" -> U,N,I,T,E -> N eliminated? Yes, N is eliminated.

So ""UTILE"" or ""PIQUE"".

Now, which one to choose? We want to test new letters.

In ""PIQUE"": letters P, I, Q, U, E. We already know U and E are in the word. So we are testing P, I, Q.

In ""UTILE"": letters U,T,I,L,E. We know U and E, so testing T, I, L.

Comparing:
- ""PIQUE"": introduces P, I, Q -> Q is infrequent, so likely less information except for Q. P and I are more common.
- ""UTILE"": introduces T, I, L -> T and L are very common letters.

Also, we have not tested I (a vowel) yet, so testing I is good.

But both ""UTILE"" and ""PIQUE"" test I.

""UTILE"" tests T and L, which are more common than Q and P.

Moreover, in ""UTILE"", U is at position 1, which we are testing.

We also have not tested L or T.

Therefore, ""UTILE"" seems better because it tests more common letters.

But earlier we have avoided Q.

Another word: ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> positions: G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). This avoids position 3 for U? Wait, U is at position 2? So in ""GUILE"", U is at position 2.

Is that acceptable? Yes, we need U at 1,2, or 4.

So ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E.

Letters: G,U,I,L,E. Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S -> G,U,I,L,E are all okay.

Similarly, ""BUILD"" ends with D? Not E.

So ""GUILE"" is a word.

Also, ""GUISE"" but S eliminated.

""GUILE"" is good.

Now, compare ""UTILE"" (U at 1) and ""GUILE"" (U at 2).

We have position flexibility.

Another one: ""FLUME"" but U at position 3? F,L,U,M,E -> U at 3, which we avoid.

""PLUMB"" not ending with E.

""DUCHY"" doesn't end with E.

Back to available words:
- Position 2: _ U _ _ E: ""QUITE"" (with Q), ""GUILE"" (G,U,I,L,E)
- Position 1: U _ _ _ E: ""UTILE"" (U,T,I,L,E)
- Position 4: _ _ _ U E: ""PIQUE"" (P,I,Q,U,E)

We could also consider ""SUGAR"" but doesn't end with E and S eliminated.

I think ""UTILE"" and ""GUILE"" are better options.

Let's choose between ""UTILE"" and ""GUILE"".

Both introduce T, I, L and G, I, L respectively? ""UTILE"": U,T,I,L,E -> tests T, I, L. ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> tests G, I, L.

So UTILE tests T and the others, GUILE tests G and L/I.

We haven't tested T, L, G, I.

I is a vowel and important to test.

Also, L and T are common consonants.

To decide, we can consider frequency. T is more common than G.

Also, by testing T, we might get more information.

Another word with U: ""BEIGE"" doesn't have U.

List:
- ""QUITE"": Q is less common.
- ""PIQUE"": Q again.
- ""GUILE"": G is acceptable, but less common than T.

So ""UTILE"": U, T, I, L, E.

Or ""CUTIE"" but C eliminated.

Therefore, I think ""UTILE"" is a good choice: uses new letters T, I, L (common) and has U at position 1 and E at 5.

So we guess ""UTILE"".

But note: in ""UTILE"", U is at position 1. We don't know if that is correct, but we are testing.

Also, if U is not at 1, then it must be at 2 or 4.

By putting U at 1, we can confirm or eliminate that position.

Therefore, let's go with ""UTILE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is correctly placed at position 5 (E(✓)), and C, R, A, N are absent (x). So the secret word ends with E and excludes C, R, A, N.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,judge,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word in Wordle. It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)

This tells us:
1. The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
2. The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Ends with E (since we know position 5 is E)
- Does not contain C, R, A, N (since they are absent)
- Includes other common letters to get more information.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Let's think of words ending with E that avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

Common letters we might try: S, T, L, O, U, D, G, H, I, etc.

We can try to use a word that has as many new letters as possible to maximize information.

One common strategy is to try a word that includes common vowels and consonants we haven't tried yet.

We know the word has an E at the end. We haven't tried the vowels: O, I, U (A is already excluded). Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to form a word ending with E.

Possible words: 
- We could try ""SLATE"", but S, L, T are new, but note: A is excluded (from feedback: A is not in the word). So ""SLATE"" is invalid because it contains A.

We must avoid A.

Another idea: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E. This avoids C, R, A, N.

But let's check: 
- S, P, I, T are new, and E is at the end.

Alternatively, ""SHINE"" -> but H, I, N: but N is excluded (feedback: N not in word). So ""SHINE"" is invalid.

""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E. Avoids C, R, A, N. This seems good.

""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E. Also avoids the excluded letters.

We want to cover more vowels. We haven't tried O, I, U. So ""STOLE"" has O, which is a vowel we haven't tested.

But note: we also want to test common consonants. Another popular choice might be ""POISE"", but that ends with E and has O, I, S. However, P, O, I, S, E. This is also valid.

But we must avoid A and N, which we are.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has the E at the end and uses as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some words ending with E that don't contain C, R, A, N:
- BIBLE -> but B, I, B, L, E -> has two B's, which might not be ideal for information.
- TITLE -> T, I, T, L, E -> two T's.
- STOLE: S, T, O, L, E -> all unique letters.
- POISE: P, O, I, S, E -> all unique.
- QUITE: Q, U, I, T, E -> but Q is less common and U is a vowel we haven't tried.

We might prefer to test more common letters.

Another idea: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. This has two vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (H, S). But note: we know E is at the end, so we are testing H, O, U, S.

This seems good because we get to test O and U, which are vowels.

But we must avoid A, which we are, and also R, C, N.

So ""HOUSE"" is a candidate.

Alternatively, ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E.

Or ""DOUSE"" -> D, O, U, S, E.

But let's consider: we have only one E and it's at the end. We don't know if there are other E's, but the feedback only showed the last E as correct. However, it's possible that there are other E's? But the feedback for the other positions didn't show E, but in ""crane"", the E was at the end and correct. The other positions didn't have E, but that doesn't mean the word doesn't have another E. However, in the feedback, if there were another E, and we had placed it in the wrong position, it would have shown as '-'. But in ""crane"", we only had E at the end and it was correct, and the other letters were absent. So we don't know about other E's.

But note: the feedback for the first four letters were all 'x', meaning they are not in the word. So the word does not have C, R, A, N. And the E at the end is present. But we don't know if there is another E.

However, in our next guess, we can try to test for other E's? But we are forced to put E at the end. So we can only test for E in other positions by putting it in a different position? But we know the last position is E, so we must have E at the end in every guess? Actually, no. We can put E in a different position to see if there is a double E? But the feedback told us that the last letter is E, so we know that at least the last letter is E. But if we put E in another position, we might get information about whether there is another E.

However, in the next guess, we are allowed to put E in a different position? But we know that the last letter is E, so if we don't put E at the end, we are wasting the known position. It's better to use the known E at the end to free up other positions for new letters.

So I think we should keep E at the end and try new letters in the first four positions.

Therefore, we should choose a word that ends with E and uses four new letters (not C, R, A, N, and also not repeating letters unnecessarily).

We have 26 letters minus 5 we know (C, R, A, N, and we know E is in, but we are using E at the end) so we have 21 letters left. But we are using E, so we can choose from the other 20 (excluding C, R, A, N, and E? But E is allowed again? Actually, the word might have multiple E's, so we can use E again? But in our guess, we can use E again to test if there is a double E? However, in the first guess, we only had one E and it was at the end. If we put an E in the middle and it is present, then we know there is another E. But if we don't, we might not know.

But to maximize information, it's better to use all new letters. So we avoid repeating E for now.

So we want a word that ends with E, and the first four letters are new (not C, R, A, N) and not E? Actually, we can use E again? But let's avoid for now to get more information.

So the word should have four new letters in positions 1-4 and E at position 5.

We have many options.

Let me list some words:
- BITE: B, I, T, E -> but only 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So 5-letter words.

5-letter words ending with E, without C, R, A, N.

Examples:
- ""BIBLE"" -> but has two B's -> not ideal.
- ""TITLE"" -> two T's.
- ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E -> all unique.
- ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> all unique.
- ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> unique, but Q is uncommon.
- ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> all unique.
- ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> unique.
- ""DOUSE"" -> D, O, U, S, E -> unique.
- ""LOUSE"" -> L, O, U, S, E -> unique, but same as above with L.

We also have ""SLIME"", but S, L, I, M, E -> but we must avoid A? Yes, and it doesn't have A. But note: we don't know if the word has S, L, I, M. But we are testing them.

But ""SLIME"" is valid.

However, we want to test vowels. We haven't tested O, I, U. So words with O, I, U are good.

""HOUSE"" has O and U.

""POISE"" has O and I.

Which one to choose?

We can also consider the frequency of letters.

In English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A and N are out, so we focus on T, O, I, S.

We have not tried T, O, I, S, etc.

So ""TOISE"" is not a word. ""POISE"" is a word.

""HOUSE"" is a very common word.

Another one: ""SUITE"" -> S, U, I, T, E -> but that has U, I, T, S. This is also good.

But let's pick one.

I think ""HOUSE"" is a good choice because it tests H, O, U, S, and we know E is at the end.

So I'll go with ""HOUSE"".

But note: we are not forced to use the known E at the end? Actually, we can, and it's beneficial because if we get a ✓ for E again, we know it's fixed. But we already know it's fixed. However, if we don't put E at the end, then we might get feedback that E is in the word but in the wrong position? But we know it should be at the end. So it's better to use it at the end to avoid confusion and to get information about the other positions.

So I think ""HOUSE"" is a solid second guess.

Therefore, my second guess is ""HOUSE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Ensure the word ends with E (to leverage the known correct position).
2. Avoid using C, R, A, or N (since they are absent from the secret word).
3. Introduce new, common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., testing vowels like O, U, I and consonants like S, T, H).

A strong candidate is ""HOUSE"":
- It ends with E, satisfying the known position.
- It uses new letters (H, O, U, S) that haven't been tested yet.
- It covers two vowels (O, U) and common consonants (H, S), which could help reveal more about the secret word.

<guess>house</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: house -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) U(-) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
   - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
   - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

2. ""house"": H(x) O(x) U(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is again correctly placed at position 5 (confirming this).
   - H, O, S are not in the word.
   - U is in the word but not in the position guessed (position 3).

So we know:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- U is present in the word, but not at position 3.
- We have eliminated these letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S.

The letters that are in the word: We know E and U are in the word, and possibly others.

Now, we need to make a third guess. The word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E

U is in the word but not at position 3. So U must be at position 1, 2, or 4.

We need to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Includes U in position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S.
- Uses new letters to get more information.

We have eliminated consonants H, S and vowels O. We haven't tested other common vowels (I) and consonants (like T, L, P, M, D, G, etc.).

Given that U is present, we should try to determine its position by placing it in different locations.

Possible positions for U: 1, 2, or 4.

We should also test other common letters. Since the word has U and E, it might have other common letters.

We need a word using only available letters and including U and E.

Available letters: all except C, R, A, N, H, O, S. So avoid these.

Word pattern: positions 1-4: any letter except C,R,A,N,H,O,S. Position 5: E.

And U must be in one of positions 1,2,4.

Now, what words fit this?

Let me think of 5-letter words ending in E, containing U, and excluding C,R,A,N,H,O,S.

Possible words:
- ""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E -> but Q might be rare and we haven't eliminated Q.
  - However, we are avoiding S (which is eliminated), but S is not in QUITE.
- ""SUITE"": but S is eliminated, so not allowed (because S is not in the word).
- ""GLUED"": G,L,U,E,D -> ends with E? No, it ends with D. So not.
  - We need a word ending with E.

Actually, ""GLUE"" is only 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Let's list:
- ""BLUES"": But S is eliminated, so we avoid S.
- ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> E at end, and has U. But does it avoid eliminated letters? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So F,L,U,K are new, S not used. So yes.
- ""FLUTE"": F,L,U,T,E -> similar.
- ""JUICE"": J,U,I,C,E -> but C is eliminated, cannot use C.
- ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> but O and R and N are eliminated, so no.
- ""POULE"": but I think P,O? O is eliminated.

We should avoid O as well.

So words without C,R,A,N,H,O,S.

Let me try to generate words:

- With U: and ending in E.

Examples:
- ""LUCRE"": but R is eliminated -> not allowed.
- ""DUVET"": D,U,V,E,T -> but does it end with E? DUVET ends with T? No, D-U-V-E-T -> last letter is T? Actually, DUVET is 5 letters: D-U-V-E-T? But ""duvet"" ends with T, so not ending with E.

Proper words:
- ""ABUSE"": but A is eliminated.
- ""AMUSE"": but A is eliminated.
- ""BLUED"": B,L,U,E,D -> but ends with D? No, but if present tense, ""blue"" is 4 letters. ""Blued"" would be past tense, meaning made blue, but it ends with D, not E.

We need a word that naturally ends with E and has U.

Common possibilities:
- ""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> yes! Ends with E, and has U at position 3? Positions: P(1), L(2), U(3), M(4), E(5). But from guess 2, U is in the word but not in position 3. So if I put U at position 3 again, it would be wrong? Yes, in ""house"", U was at position 3 and it was wrong position. So in the secret word, U is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""PLUME"", U is at position 3 again, which we know is incorrect, so this word would have U in position 3, which is a bad guess because we know U is not at position 3. We should avoid putting U at position 3.

So we need a word with U at position 1, 2, or 4.

Position 1: U _ _ _ E
Examples: USAGE (but S and A eliminated), UNABLE (A and N eliminated), etc. Not many.

Position 2: _ U _ _ E
Examples: QUITE (Q,U,I,T,E), or BUTTE (but B,U,T,T,E? and T repeated), or FUTILE (too long? 6 letters). ""QUIET"" ends with T? No. ""QUITE"" is good: Q,U,I,T,E -> letters: Q,U,I,T,E, all not eliminated? C,R,A,N,H,O,S eliminated, so Q,U,I,T,E are all available. E is used at end, but we are testing with E at end.

Position 4: _ _ _ U E
Examples: ARGUE (A eliminated), VAGUE (A eliminated), PIQUE (P,I,Q,U,E), or toQUE (ends with UE? ""TOQUE"" is a hat, but it ends with E? Actually, ""toque"" is spelled T-O-Q-U-E? That's 5 letters: T, O, Q, U, E. But O is eliminated? In ""toque"", position 2 is O, which we cannot use because O is not in the word. So we avoid O.

Another: CLOUE? Not a word.

Better: ""GLUTE"" -> glute muscles? But ""glute"" is typically ""glutes"" plural? Also, G,L,U,T,E -> positions: G(1), L(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But U is at position 3? And we know U is not at position 3? ""GLUTE"" would have U at position 3, which we should avoid.

So we must avoid U at position 3.

So for position 2: _ U _ _ E
Words: QUITE (Q,U,I,T,E) -> this works? But Q is not common. Another: ""DUVET"" doesn't end with E? ""DUVET"" ends with T.

What about ""SUITE""? But S is eliminated.

""BUYER"" ends with R? Not E.

""JUICE"" has C? C is eliminated.

""QUILT"" ends with T? No.

Another: ""LUCKY"" doesn't end with E.

Let me think: Valid words for position 2: U at 2.
- Maybe ""MUTED"": M,U,T,E,D -> ends with D? No, but ""muted"" is M-U-T-E-D, so E in position 4? Then ends with D. Not E at end.

We need the word to end with E.

Perhaps: ""PAUSE"" but P,A,U,S,E -> A and S eliminated.

So difficult without position 3 U.

Another for position 4: _ _ _ U E
Words: ""ENSUE"" -> E,N,S,U,E but N and S eliminated and also E at position 1? But we don't know about E at beginning. However, E at position 1? But in ""crane"", E was at 5 and we had C,R,A,N at other positions? But we don't know if E appears elsewhere.

Possible word: ""issue"" but ends with E? I-S-S-U-E? Has S eliminated.

Let's try: ""PIQUE"" -> P,I,Q,U,E -> positions: P(1), I(2), Q(3), U(4), E(5). This fits: U at position 4, and ends with E, and letters: P, I, Q, U, E. Are they eliminated? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So P,I,Q,U,E are all okay? E is used at end.

Q is a less common letter, but it's acceptable.

Another possibility: ""BIQUE""? Not a word.

""TOQUE"" has O.

So ""PIQUE"" might work.

Position 1: U _ _ _ E
Words: ""USUAL"" doesn't end with E? Or ""URBAN"" doesn't end with E? How about ""UNCLE"" -> U,N,C,L,E -> N and C eliminated. ""UNLIT"" ends with T? No.

Another: ""UTILE"": U,T,I,L,E -> positions: U(1), T(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). This word? Yes, ""utile"" means useful. So U,T,I,L,E. Avoids eliminated letters? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So U,T,I,L,E are all allowed. And U is at position 1.

Similarly, ""UNITE"" -> U,N,I,T,E -> N eliminated? Yes, N is eliminated.

So ""UTILE"" or ""PIQUE"".

Now, which one to choose? We want to test new letters.

In ""PIQUE"": letters P, I, Q, U, E. We already know U and E are in the word. So we are testing P, I, Q.

In ""UTILE"": letters U,T,I,L,E. We know U and E, so testing T, I, L.

Comparing:
- ""PIQUE"": introduces P, I, Q -> Q is infrequent, so likely less information except for Q. P and I are more common.
- ""UTILE"": introduces T, I, L -> T and L are very common letters.

Also, we have not tested I (a vowel) yet, so testing I is good.

But both ""UTILE"" and ""PIQUE"" test I.

""UTILE"" tests T and L, which are more common than Q and P.

Moreover, in ""UTILE"", U is at position 1, which we are testing.

We also have not tested L or T.

Therefore, ""UTILE"" seems better because it tests more common letters.

But earlier we have avoided Q.

Another word: ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> positions: G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). This avoids position 3 for U? Wait, U is at position 2? So in ""GUILE"", U is at position 2.

Is that acceptable? Yes, we need U at 1,2, or 4.

So ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E.

Letters: G,U,I,L,E. Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S -> G,U,I,L,E are all okay.

Similarly, ""BUILD"" ends with D? Not E.

So ""GUILE"" is a word.

Also, ""GUISE"" but S eliminated.

""GUILE"" is good.

Now, compare ""UTILE"" (U at 1) and ""GUILE"" (U at 2).

We have position flexibility.

Another one: ""FLUME"" but U at position 3? F,L,U,M,E -> U at 3, which we avoid.

""PLUMB"" not ending with E.

""DUCHY"" doesn't end with E.

Back to available words:
- Position 2: _ U _ _ E: ""QUITE"" (with Q), ""GUILE"" (G,U,I,L,E)
- Position 1: U _ _ _ E: ""UTILE"" (U,T,I,L,E)
- Position 4: _ _ _ U E: ""PIQUE"" (P,I,Q,U,E)

We could also consider ""SUGAR"" but doesn't end with E and S eliminated.

I think ""UTILE"" and ""GUILE"" are better options.

Let's choose between ""UTILE"" and ""GUILE"".

Both introduce T, I, L and G, I, L respectively? ""UTILE"": U,T,I,L,E -> tests T, I, L. ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> tests G, I, L.

So UTILE tests T and the others, GUILE tests G and L/I.

We haven't tested T, L, G, I.

I is a vowel and important to test.

Also, L and T are common consonants.

To decide, we can consider frequency. T is more common than G.

Also, by testing T, we might get more information.

Similarly, G is less common than T.

Therefore, perhaps ""UTILE"" is better because it uses the more common T.

We could think of other words: for example, ""TIMED"" wouldn't work because M,E,D? Positions: but ends with D? No.

Another word with U: ""BEIGE"" doesn't have U.

List:
- ""QUITE"": Q is less common.
- ""PIQUE"": Q again.
- ""GUILE"": G is acceptable, but less common than T.

So ""UTILE"": U, T, I, L, E.

Or ""CUTIE"" but C eliminated.

Therefore, I think ""UTILE"" is a good choice: uses new letters T, I, L (common) and has U at position 1 and E at 5.

So we guess ""UTILE"".

But note: in ""UTILE"", U is at position 1. We don't know if that is correct, but we are testing.

Also, if U is not at 1, then it must be at 2 or 4.

By putting U at 1, we can confirm or eliminate that position.

Similarly, we get information about T, I, L.

Therefore, let's go with ""UTILE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is correctly placed at position 5 (E(✓)), and C, R, A, N are absent (x). So the secret word ends with E and excludes C, R, A, N.
- **Guess 2 (house)**: E is confirmed at position 5 (E(✓)), U is present but not at position 3 (U(-)), and H, O, S are absent (x). This means U is in the secret word but must be at position 1, 2, or 4 (since it's not at 3), and H, O, S are excluded.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (position 5).
- U must be included at position 1, 2, or 4 (avoiding position 3).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S (all absent based on feedback).
- Focus on testing new common letters (e.g., vowels like I and consonants like T, L, D) to maximize information.

Considering these constraints:
- **UTILE** fits: U in position 1 (testing if U is at start), T in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, E in position 5.
- All letters are eligible: U (known present), T, I, L are new (not excluded), and E is fixed at position 5.
- This tests U at a different position (position 1) and introduces common consonants (T, L) and the vowel (I) for broader coverage.

Alternative words like GUILE (U at position 2) or PIQUE (U at position 4 with rare Q) were considered, but UTILE uses the more common letters T and L over G/Q.

So we can only test for E in other positions by putting it in a different position? But we know the last position is E, so we must have E at the end in every guess? Actually, no. We can put E in a different position to see if there is a double E? But the feedback told us that the last letter is E, so we know that at least the last letter is E. But if we put E in another position, we might get information about whether there is another E.\n\nHowever, in the next guess, we are allowed to put E in a different position? But we know that the last letter is E, so if we don\'t put E at the end, we are wasting the known position. It\'s better to use the known E at the end to free up other positions for new letters.\n\nSo I think we should keep E at the end and try new letters in the first four positions.\n\nTherefore, we should choose a word that ends with E and uses four new letters (not C, R, A, N, and also not repeating letters unnecessarily).\n\nWe have 26 letters minus 5 we know (C, R, A, N, and we know E is in, but we are using E at the end) so we have 21 letters left. But we are using E, so we can choose from the other 20 (excluding C, R, A, N, and E? But E is allowed again? Actually, the word might have multiple E\'s, so we can use E again? But in our guess, we can use E again to test if there is a double E? However, in the first guess, we only had one E and it was at the end. If we put an E in the middle and it is present, then we know there is another E. But if we don\'t, we might not know.\n\nBut to maximize information, it\'s better to use all new letters. So we avoid repeating E for now.\n\nSo we want a word that ends with E, and the first four letters are new (not C, R, A, N) and not E? Actually, we can use E again? But let\'s avoid for now to get more information.\n\nSo the word should have four new letters in positions 1-4 and E at position 5.\n\nWe have many options.\n\nLet me list some words:\n- BITE: B, I, T, E -> but only 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So 5-letter words.\n\n5-letter words ending with E, without C, R, A, N.\n\nExamples:\n- ""BIBLE"" -> but has two B\'s -> not ideal.\n- ""TITLE"" -> two T\'s.\n- ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E -> all unique.\n- ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> all unique.\n- ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> unique, but Q is uncommon.\n- ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> all unique.\n- ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> unique.\n- ""DOUSE"" -> D, O, U, S, E -> unique.\n- ""LOUSE"" -> L, O, U, S, E -> unique, but same as above with L.\n\nWe also have ""SLIME"", but S, L, I, M, E -> but we must avoid A? Yes, and it doesn\'t have A. But note: we don\'t know if the word has S, L, I, M. But we are testing them.\n\nBut ""SLIME"" is valid.\n\nHowever, we want to test vowels. We haven\'t tested O, I, U. So words with O, I, U are good.\n\n""HOUSE"" has O and U.\n\n""POISE"" has O and I.\n\nWhich one to choose?\n\nWe can also consider the frequency of letters.\n\nIn English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A and N are out, so we focus on T, O, I, S.\n\nWe have not tried T, O, I, S, etc.\n\nSo ""TOISE"" is not a word. ""POISE"" is a word.\n\n""HOUSE"" is a very common word.\n\nAnother one: ""SUITE"" -> S, U, I, T, E -> but that has U, I, T, S. This is also good.\n\nBut let\'s pick one.\n\nI think ""HOUSE"" is a good choice because it tests H, O, U, S, and we know E is at the end.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""HOUSE"".\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use the known E at the end? Actually, we can, and it\'s beneficial because if we get a ✓ for E again, we know it\'s fixed. But we already know it\'s fixed. However, if we don\'t put E at the end, then we might get feedback that E is in the word but in the wrong position? But we know it should be at the end. So it\'s better to use it at the end to avoid confusion and to get information about the other positions.\n\nSo I think ""HOUSE"" is a solid second guess.\n\nTherefore, my second guess is ""HOUSE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).\n- C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n1. Ensure the word ends with E (to leverage the known correct position).\n2. Avoid using C, R, A, or N (since they are absent from the secret word).\n3. Introduce new, common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., testing vowels like O, U, I and consonants like S, T, H).\n\nA strong candidate is ""HOUSE"":\n- It ends with E, satisfying the known position.\n- It uses new letters (H, O, U, S) that haven\'t been tested yet.\n- It covers two vowels (O, U) and common consonants (H, S), which could help reveal more about the secret word.\n\n<guess>house</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: house -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) U(-) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1. ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\n   - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.\n   - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\n2. ""house"": H(x) O(x) U(-) S(x) E(✓)\n   - E is again correctly placed at position 5 (confirming this).\n   - H, O, S are not in the word.\n   - U is in the word but not in the position guessed (position 3).\n\nSo we know:\n- The word ends with E (position 5).\n- U is present in the word, but not at position 3.\n- We have eliminated these letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S.\n\nThe letters that are in the word: We know E and U are in the word, and possibly others.\n\nNow, we need to make a third guess. The word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E\n\nU is in the word but not at position 3. So U must be at position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Ends with E (position 5).\n- Includes U in position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).\n- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S.\n- Uses new letters to get more information.\n\nWe have eliminated consonants H, S and vowels O. We haven\'t tested other common vowels (I) and consonants (like T, L, P, M, D, G, etc.).\n\nGiven that U is present, we should try to determine its position by placing it in different locations.\n\nPossible positions for U: 1, 2, or 4.\n\nWe should also test other common letters. Since the word has U and E, it might have other common letters.\n\nWe need a word using only available letters and including U and E.\n\nAvailable letters: all except C, R, A, N, H, O, S. So avoid these.\n\nWord pattern: positions 1-4: any letter except C,R,A,N,H,O,S. Position 5: E.\n\nAnd U must be in one of positions 1,2,4.\n\nNow, what words fit this?\n\nLet me think of 5-letter words ending in E, containing U, and excluding C,R,A,N,H,O,S.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E -> but Q might be rare and we haven\'t eliminated Q.\n  - However, we are avoiding S (which is eliminated), but S is not in QUITE.\n- ""SUITE"": but S is eliminated, so not allowed (because S is not in the word).\n- ""GLUED"": G,L,U,E,D -> ends with E? No, it ends with D. So not.\n  - We need a word ending with E.\n\nActually, ""GLUE"" is only 4 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\nLet\'s list:\n- ""BLUES"": But S is eliminated, so we avoid S.\n- ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> E at end, and has U. But does it avoid eliminated letters? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So F,L,U,K are new, S not used. So yes.\n- ""FLUTE"": F,L,U,T,E -> similar.\n- ""JUICE"": J,U,I,C,E -> but C is eliminated, cannot use C.\n- ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> but O and R and N are eliminated, so no.\n- ""POULE"": but I think P,O? O is eliminated.\n\nWe should avoid O as well.\n\nSo words without C,R,A,N,H,O,S.\n\nLet me try to generate words:\n\n- With U: and ending in E.\n\nExamples:\n- ""LUCRE"": but R is eliminated -> not allowed.\n- ""DUVET"": D,U,V,E,T -> but does it end with E? DUVET ends with T? No, D-U-V-E-T -> last letter is T? Actually, DUVET is 5 letters: D-U-V-E-T? But ""duvet"" ends with T, so not ending with E.\n\nProper words:\n- ""ABUSE"": but A is eliminated.\n- ""AMUSE"": but A is eliminated.\n- ""BLUED"": B,L,U,E,D -> but ends with D? No, but if present tense, ""blue"" is 4 letters. ""Blued"" would be past tense, meaning made blue, but it ends with D, not E.\n\nWe need a word that naturally ends with E and has U.\n\nCommon possibilities:\n- ""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> yes! Ends with E, and has U at position 3? Positions: P(1), L(2), U(3), M(4), E(5). But from guess 2, U is in the word but not in position 3. So if I put U at position 3 again, it would be wrong? Yes, in ""house"", U was at position 3 and it was wrong position. So in the secret word, U is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""PLUME"", U is at position 3 again, which we know is incorrect, so this word would have U in position 3, which is a bad guess because we know U is not at position 3. We should avoid putting U at position 3.\n\nSo we need a word with U at position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nPosition 1: U _ _ _ E\nExamples: USAGE (but S and A eliminated), UNABLE (A and N eliminated), etc. Not many.\n\nPosition 2: _ U _ _ E\nExamples: QUITE (Q,U,I,T,E), or BUTTE (but B,U,T,T,E? and T repeated), or FUTILE (too long? 6 letters). ""QUIET"" ends with T? No. ""QUITE"" is good: Q,U,I,T,E -> letters: Q,U,I,T,E, all not eliminated? C,R,A,N,H,O,S eliminated, so Q,U,I,T,E are all available. E is used at end, but we are testing with E at end.\n\nPosition 4: _ _ _ U E\nExamples: ARGUE (A eliminated), VAGUE (A eliminated), PIQUE (P,I,Q,U,E), or toQUE (ends with UE? ""TOQUE"" is a hat, but it ends with E? Actually, ""toque"" is spelled T-O-Q-U-E? That\'s 5 letters: T, O, Q, U, E. But O is eliminated? In ""toque"", position 2 is O, which we cannot use because O is not in the word. So we avoid O.\n\nAnother: CLOUE? Not a word.\n\nBetter: ""GLUTE"" -> glute muscles? But ""glute"" is typically ""glutes"" plural? Also, G,L,U,T,E -> positions: G(1), L(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But U is at position 3? And we know U is not at position 3? ""GLUTE"" would have U at position 3, which we should avoid.\n\nSo we must avoid U at position 3.\n\nSo for position 2: _ U _ _ E\nWords: QUITE (Q,U,I,T,E) -> this works? But Q is not common. Another: ""DUVET"" doesn\'t end with E? ""DUVET"" ends with T.\n\nWhat about ""SUITE""? But S is eliminated.\n\n""BUYER"" ends with R? Not E.\n\n""JUICE"" has C? C is eliminated.\n\n""QUILT"" ends with T? No.\n\nAnother: ""LUCKY"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\nLet me think: Valid words for position 2: U at 2.\n- Maybe ""MUTED"": M,U,T,E,D -> ends with D? No, but ""muted"" is M-U-T-E-D, so E in position 4? Then ends with D. Not E at end.\n\nWe need the word to end with E.\n\nPerhaps: ""PAUSE"" but P,A,U,S,E -> A and S eliminated.\n\nSo difficult without position 3 U.\n\nAnother for position 4: _ _ _ U E\nWords: ""ENSUE"" -> E,N,S,U,E but N and S eliminated and also E at position 1? But we don\'t know about E at beginning. However, E at position 1? But in ""crane"", E was at 5 and we had C,R,A,N at other positions? But we don\'t know if E appears elsewhere.\n\nPossible word: ""issue"" but ends with E? I-S-S-U-E? Has S eliminated.\n\nLet\'s try: ""PIQUE"" -> P,I,Q,U,E -> positions: P(1), I(2), Q(3), U(4), E(5). This fits: U at position 4, and ends with E, and letters: P, I, Q, U, E. Are they eliminated? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So P,I,Q,U,E are all okay? E is used at end.\n\nQ is a less common letter, but it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother possibility: ""BIQUE""? Not a word.\n\n""TOQUE"" has O.\n\nSo ""PIQUE"" might work.\n\nPosition 1: U _ _ _ E\nWords: ""USUAL"" doesn\'t end with E? Or ""URBAN"" doesn\'t end with E? How about ""UNCLE"" -> U,N,C,L,E -> N and C eliminated. ""UNLIT"" ends with T? No.\n\nAnother: ""UTILE"": U,T,I,L,E -> positions: U(1), T(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). This word? Yes, ""utile"" means useful. So U,T,I,L,E. Avoids eliminated letters? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So U,T,I,L,E are all allowed. And U is at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, ""UNITE"" -> U,N,I,T,E -> N eliminated? Yes, N is eliminated.\n\nSo ""UTILE"" or ""PIQUE"".\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test new letters.\n\nIn ""PIQUE"": letters P, I, Q, U, E. We already know U and E are in the word. So we are testing P, I, Q.\n\nIn ""UTILE"": letters U,T,I,L,E. We know U and E, so testing T, I, L.\n\nComparing:\n- ""PIQUE"": introduces P, I, Q -> Q is infrequent, so likely less information except for Q. P and I are more common.\n- ""UTILE"": introduces T, I, L -> T and L are very common letters.\n\nAlso, we have not tested I (a vowel) yet, so testing I is good.\n\nBut both ""UTILE"" and ""PIQUE"" test I.\n\n""UTILE"" tests T and L, which are more common than Q and P.\n\nMoreover, in ""UTILE"", U is at position 1, which we are testing.\n\nWe also have not tested L or T.\n\nTherefore, ""UTILE"" seems better because it tests more common letters.\n\nBut earlier we have avoided Q.\n\nAnother word: ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> positions: G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). This avoids position 3 for U? Wait, U is at position 2? So in ""GUILE"", U is at position 2.\n\nIs that acceptable? Yes, we need U at 1,2, or 4.\n\nSo ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E.\n\nLetters: G,U,I,L,E. Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S -> G,U,I,L,E are all okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""BUILD"" ends with D? Not E.\n\nSo ""GUILE"" is a word.\n\nAlso, ""GUISE"" but S eliminated.\n\n""GUILE"" is good.\n\nNow, compare ""UTILE"" (U at 1) and ""GUILE"" (U at 2).\n\nWe have position flexibility.\n\nAnother one: ""FLUME"" but U at position 3? F,L,U,M,E -> U at 3, which we avoid.\n\n""PLUMB"" not ending with E.\n\n""DUCHY"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\nBack to available words:\n- Position 2: _ U _ _ E: ""QUITE"" (with Q), ""GUILE"" (G,U,I,L,E)\n- Position 1: U _ _ _ E: ""UTILE"" (U,T,I,L,E)\n- Position 4: _ _ _ U E: ""PIQUE"" (P,I,Q,U,E)\n\nWe could also consider ""SUGAR"" but doesn\'t end with E and S eliminated.\n\nI think ""UTILE"" and ""GUILE"" are better options.\n\nLet\'s choose between ""UTILE"" and ""GUILE"".\n\nBoth introduce T, I, L and G, I, L respectively? ""UTILE"": U,T,I,L,E -> tests T, I, L. ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> tests G, I, L.\n\nSo UTILE tests T and the others, GUILE tests G and L/I.\n\nWe haven\'t tested T, L, G, I.\n\nI is a vowel and important to test.\n\nAlso, L and T are common consonants.\n\nTo decide, we can consider frequency. T is more common than G.\n\nAlso, by testing T, we might get more information.\n\nSimilarly, G is less common than T.\n\nTherefore, perhaps ""UTILE"" is better because it uses the more common T.\n\nWe could think of other words: for example, ""TIMED"" wouldn\'t work because M,E,D? Positions: but ends with D? No.\n\nAnother word with U: ""BEIGE"" doesn\'t have U.\n\nList:\n- ""QUITE"": Q is less common.\n- ""PIQUE"": Q again.\n- ""GUILE"": G is acceptable, but less common than T.\n\nSo ""UTILE"": U, T, I, L, E.\n\nOr ""CUTIE"" but C eliminated.\n\nTherefore, I think ""UTILE"" is a good choice: uses new letters T, I, L (common) and has U at position 1 and E at 5.\n\nSo we guess ""UTILE"".\n\nBut note: in ""UTILE"", U is at position 1. We don\'t know if that is correct, but we are testing.\n\nAlso, if U is not at 1, then it must be at 2 or 4.\n\nBy putting U at 1, we can confirm or eliminate that position.\n\nSimilarly, we get information about T, I, L.\n\nTherefore, let\'s go with ""UTILE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is correctly placed at position 5 (E(✓)), and C, R, A, N are absent (x). So the secret word ends with E and excludes C, R, A, N.\n- **Guess 2 (house)**: E is confirmed at position 5 (E(✓)), U is present but not at position 3 (U(-)), and H, O, S are absent (x). This means U is in the secret word but must be at position 1, 2, or 4 (since it\'s not at 3), and H, O, S are excluded.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with E (position 5).\n- U must be included at position 1, 2, or 4 (avoiding position 3).\n- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S (all absent based on feedback).\n- Focus on testing new common letters (e.g., vowels like I and consonants like T, L, D) to maximize information.\n\nConsidering these constraints:\n- **UTILE** fits: U in position 1 (testing if U is at start), T in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, E in position 5.\n- All letters are eligible: U (known present), T, I, L are new (not excluded), and E is fixed at position 5.\n- This tests U at a different position (position 1) and introduces common consonants (T, L) and the vowel (I) for broader coverage.\n\nAlternative words like GUILE (U at position 2) or PIQUE (U at position 4 with rare Q) were considered, but UTILE uses the more common letters T and L over G/Q.\n\n<guess>utile</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: house -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) U(-) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: utile -> FEEDBACK: U(-) T(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter). C, R, A, N are absent.

2. ""house"":
   - H(x), O(x), U(-), S(x), E(✓)
   → E is correct at position 5. U is present but not at position 3. H, O, S are absent.

3. ""utile"":
   - U(-), T(x), I(x), L(x), E(✓)
   → E is correct at position 5. U is present but not at position 1 (since we tried U at position 1 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but wrong position). T, I, L are absent.

Summary of known information:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- U is in the word, but not at position 1 or 3 (from ""utile"" and ""house"").
- Therefore, U must be at position 2 or 4 (since position 5 is E, and positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S, T, I, L (from the x's in all guesses).
- Present letters: U and E (E at position 5, U somewhere else).

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains U at position 2 or 4.
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, H, O, S, T, I, L.
- We have not tested many other letters, so we should introduce new common letters.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 10 absent letters (C,R,A,N,H,O,S,T,I,L) and minus E and U (which we know are in, but we can use them again if needed). However, we must avoid the absent letters.

List of absent letters: A, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T (10 letters).

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (14 letters). Plus we know U and E are in, but we are using E at the end.

The word must have U at position 2 or 4.

We need to test new letters to find the secret word.

Possible positions:
Case 1: U at position 2: _ U _ _ E
Case 2: U at position 4: _ _ _ U E

We should choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible from the available set.

Common letters from the remaining: B, D, F, G, M, P, W, Y are more common than others.

We can try to form words for both cases.

First, let's try U at position 2: _ U _ _ E
- We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters from B,D,F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (avoiding the absent list).
- Examples: 
  - ""BUYER"" but ends with R? Not E. Also, Y is available, but ""buyer"" is B-U-Y-E-R, so ends with R? No, it's 5 letters: B-U-Y-E-R? Then position 5 is R, not E. So not.
  - ""DUVET"" ends with T? D-U-V-E-T, so position 5 is T, not E.
  - ""JUMPS"" ends with S? Not E, and S is absent.
  - ""MUNGE""? M-U-N-G-E but N is absent? N is in the absent list, so no.
  - ""PURGE"": P-U-R-G-E but R is absent? R is in absent list.
  - ""FUDGE"": F-U-D-G-E -> positions: F(1), U(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). This seems good? Letters: F, U, D, G, E. Check absent: F, D, G are not in the absent list. U and E are known. So yes.

""FUDGE"" is a word: a type of candy or to fake something.

But we have U at position 2, which is a possibility.

Now, U at position 4: _ _ _ U E
- Fill positions 1,2,3 with available letters.
- Examples:
  - ""ARGUE"" but A and R absent.
  - ""BEGIN"" ends with N? Not E.
  - ""BEIGE"" no U.
  - ""PIQUE"": P-I-Q-U-E, but I is absent? From ""utile"", I is absent (I(x)), so we cannot use I. So ""PIQUE"" is invalid because of I.
  - ""VAGUE"": V-A-G-U-E, but A is absent.
  - ""FUGUE"": F-U-G-U-E? Positions: F(1), U(2), G(3), U(4), E(5). But U is repeated? And we don't know if the word has two U's. But in feedback, we only know one U is present. However, it could have two. But let's see: ""FUGUE"" has U at position 2 and 4? But we are trying U at position 4, but in this word, U is also at 2? Actually, ""FUGUE"" is F-U-G-U-E, so U at 2 and 4. But we are not sure if the secret word has two U's. Also, we are testing U at position 4, but if we put U at position 2, it might be correct or not? But we are not constraining position 2 here.

But we are trying to test U at position 4, so we can have a word with U only at position 4? Or with U at another position? But we know U is not at position 1 or 3, so it could be at 2 and 4? But we don't know.

To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with U only at position 4.

But let's list possible words for _ _ _ U E:
- ""BEVUE"": B-E-V-U-E? But E at position 2? And we have E at position 5, but we don't know about another E. Also, ""bevue"" is a word? I think it's rare, meaning a mistake. But let's check: B(1), E(2), V(3), U(4), E(5). So it has E at position 2 and 5. But we know E is at 5, but we don't know about position 2. Also, E is not in the absent list? But we haven't tested E elsewhere. However, in ""crane"", we only had E at 5, and the other positions were absent, but that doesn't mean E can't be elsewhere. Similarly in ""house"" and ""utile"", we had E only at 5. So it's possible to have another E.

But ""BEVUE"" uses E at position 2, which we are not sure about.

Similarly, ""DEUCE"": D-E-U-C-E, but C is absent.

""JUDGE"": J-U-D-G-E? Positions: J(1), U(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). But here U is at position 2, not 4. We are looking for U at position 4.

For position 4: 
- ""BUDGE"": B-U-D-G-E? U at position 2? Not 4.
- ""FUDGE"" has U at 2.
- ""GAUZE"": G-A-U-Z-E, A absent.
- ""PLUME"": P-L-U-M-E, but L absent? L is absent from ""utile"" feedback (L(x)).

Another: ""QUEUE"": Q-U-E-U-E? But U at 2 and 4? And E at 3 and 5. But Q is available, but let's see: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). This has U at 2 and 4, and E at 3 and 5. But we know E is at 5, but we don't know about position 3. Also, E at 3 might be possible? But we haven't tested. However, the word has multiple U and E.

But it uses Q and U, E.

But we are trying to test U at position 4, so ""QUEUE"" has U at 4, but also at 2.

Similarly, ""VOGUE"": V-O-G-U-E, O absent.

""VENUE"": V-E-N-U-E, N absent.

So it's hard to find a word with U only at position 4.

Perhaps ""BEMUD"": not ending with E.

Another: ""EXUDE"": E-X-U-D-E? But E at position 1 and 5? And X, U, D. But E at position 1? We don't know. Also, ""exude"" is E-X-U-D-E, so positions: E(1), X(2), U(3), D(4), E(5). But U is at position 3? But we know U is not at position 3 from ""house"" feedback (U at position 3 was marked as '-', meaning not there). So we cannot put U at position 3. Therefore, ""exude"" is invalid because U is at 3.

Similarly, any word with U at 3 is invalid.

So for U at position 4, we need a word where U is at 4 and not at 2? Or it can be at 2 as well? But we don't know.

To keep it simple, we can choose ""FUDGE"" for the U at position 2 case.

But in ""FUDGE"", U is at position 2, which is a possibility.

We also have the option of U at position 4, but we couldn't find a common word without using absent letters.

Another word for U at position 4: ""PIQUE"" is invalid because of I.

""TOQUE"" has O.

""DUOMO"" not ending with E.

Perhaps ""BEVUE"" or ""ENSUE"" but S absent.

I think ""FUDGE"" is a good candidate: it uses new letters F, D, G, and has U at position 2.

We can also consider other words with U at position 2.

For example, ""MUDGE"": M-U-D-G-E -> similar to FUDGE but with M.

Or ""PUDGE"": P-U-D-G-E.

But ""FUDGE"" is a common word.

We could also test for U at position 4 with a word like ""QUEUE"", but it has multiple U and E, which might be less likely.

But let's stick with ""FUDGE"" for now.

However, we must consider that in ""FUDGE"", we are putting U at position 2. If U is actually at position 4, then in the feedback, U will show as absent? No, because U is in the word, so if we put it at position 2 and it's actually at 4, we will get a '-' for U (present but wrong position). Similarly, if it is at position 2, we get a '✓'.

So by guessing ""FUDGE"", we can determine the position of U.

Moreover, we test F, D, G.

Therefore, I think ""FUDGE"" is a reasonable guess.

But note: we have not tested B, M, P, W, Y, etc., but we can test them in future guesses.

So let's go with ""FUDGE"".Based on the feedback:
- U must be at position 2 or 4 (since it's not at 1, 3, or 5).
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- Absent letters: A, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T.
- Present letters: U and E.

""FUDGE"" is a valid 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Places U at position 2 (testing that possibility).
- Uses new, untested letters (F, D, G) to gain more information.
- Avoids all absent letters.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is correct and in position 5 (E(✓)). C, R, A, N are absent (x).
   - **Guess 2 (house)**: E is correct in position 5 (E(✓)). U is present but not in position 3 (U(-)). H, O, S are absent (x).
   - **Guess 3 (utile)**: E is correct in position 5 (E(✓)). U is present but not in position 1 (U(-)). T, I, L are absent (x).

2. **Key Insights:**
   - **Position 5 is E**: The secret word ends with E.
   - **U is present but position unknown**: U cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (based on feedback). Therefore, U must be in position 2 or 4.
   - **Absent letters (10 total)**: A, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T (eliminated from all guesses).
   - **Present letters**: Only U and E are confirmed so far (E is fixed at position 5).
   - **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (14 letters remain).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - **Prioritize testing U's position**: Since U must be in position 2 or 4, the guess should place U in one of these spots to narrow it down.
   - **Maximize new information**: Use untested common consonants (e.g., D, F, G, M, P) to cover more ground.
   - **Avoid absent letters**: Ensure no eliminated letters (A, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T) are used.
   - **Word structure**: The word must end with E (position 5).

4. **Candidate Words:**
   - **U in position 2 (pattern: _ U _ _ E)**: 
     - ""FUDGE"" (F, U, D, G, E) fits perfectly: Tests U at position 2 and introduces new common letters F, D, G.
     - Alternatives like ""MUDGE"" or ""PUDGE"" were considered, but ""FUDGE"" is a common word with high-frequency letters.
   - **U in position 4 (pattern: _ _ _ U E)**:
     - Fewer options exist (e.g., ""QUEUE"" or ""BEVUE""), but these use rare letters (Q) or repeat E, reducing information gain. ""FUDGE"" is stronger for this guess.

5. **Why ""FUDGE""?**
   - Tests U at position 2: If U is correct here, we get a ✓; if not (and U is at position 4), we get a (-), resolving U's position.
   - Introduces three new letters (F, D, G), which are common consonants.
   - Avoids all absent letters and reuses E (correctly placed) and U (known present).
   - If ""FUDGE"" is incorrect, feedback on F, D, and G will significantly narrow possibilities for future guesses.

<guess>fudge</guess>",fudge,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter). C, R, A, N are absent.

2. ""house"":
   - H(x), O(x), U(-), S(x), E(✓)
   → E is correct at position 5. U is present but not at position 3. H, O, S are absent.

3. ""utile"":
   - U(-), T(x), I(x), L(x), E(✓)
   → E is correct at position 5. U is present but not at position 1 (since we tried U at position 1 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but wrong position). T, I, L are absent.

Summary of known information:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- U is in the word, but not at position 1 or 3 (from ""utile"" and ""house"").
- Therefore, U must be at position 2 or 4 (since position 5 is E, and positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S, T, I, L (from the x's in all guesses).
- Present letters: U and E (E at position 5, U somewhere else).

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains U at position 2 or 4.
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, H, O, S, T, I, L.
- We have not tested many other letters, so we should introduce new common letters.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 10 absent letters (C,R,A,N,H,O,S,T,I,L) and minus E and U (which we know are in, but we can use them again if needed). However, we must avoid the absent letters.

List of absent letters: A, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T (10 letters).

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (14 letters). Plus we know U and E are in, but we are using E at the end.

The word must have U at position 2 or 4.

We need to test new letters to find the secret word.

Possible positions:
Case 1: U at position 2: _ U _ _ E
Case 2: U at position 4: _ _ _ U E

We should choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible from the available set.

Common letters from the remaining: B, D, F, G, M, P, W, Y are more common than others.

We can try to form words for both cases.

First, let's try U at position 2: _ U _ _ E
- We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters from B,D,F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (avoiding the absent list).
- Examples: 
  - ""BUYER"" but ends with R? Not E. Also, Y is available, but ""buyer"" is B-U-Y-E-R, so ends with R? No, it's 5 letters: B-U-Y-E-R? Then position 5 is R, not E. So not.
  - ""DUVET"" ends with T? D-U-V-E-T, so position 5 is T, not E.
  - ""JUMPS"" ends with S? Not E, and S is absent.
  - ""MUNGE""? M-U-N-G-E but N is absent? N is in the absent list, so no.
  - ""PURGE"": P-U-R-G-E but R is absent? R is in absent list.
  - ""FUDGE"": F-U-D-G-E -> positions: F(1), U(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). This seems good? Letters: F, U, D, G, E. Check absent: F, D, G are not in the absent list. U and E are known. So yes.

""FUDGE"" is a word: a type of candy or to fake something.

But we have U at position 2, which is a possibility.

Now, U at position 4: _ _ _ U E
- Fill positions 1,2,3 with available letters.
- Examples:
  - ""ARGUE"" but A and R absent.
  - ""BEGIN"" ends with N? Not E.
  - ""BEIGE"" no U.
  - ""PIQUE"": P-I-Q-U-E, but I is absent? From ""utile"", I is absent (I(x)), so we cannot use I. So ""PIQUE"" is invalid because of I.
  - ""VAGUE"": V-A-G-U-E, but A is absent.
  - ""FUGUE"": F-U-G-U-E? Positions: F(1), U(2), G(3), U(4), E(5). But U is repeated? And we don't know if the word has two U's. But in feedback, we only know one U is present. However, it could have two. But let's see: ""FUGUE"" has U at position 2 and 4? But we are trying U at position 4, but in this word, U is also at 2? Actually, ""FUGUE"" is F-U-G-U-E, so U at 2 and 4. But we are not sure if the secret word has two U's. Also, we are testing U at position 4, but if we put U at position 2, it might be correct or not? But we are not constraining position 2 here.

But we are trying to test U at position 4, so we can have a word with U only at position 4? Or with U at another position? But we know U is not at position 1 or 3, so it could be at 2 and 4? But we don't know.

To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with U only at position 4.

But let's list possible words for _ _ _ U E:
- ""BEVUE"": B-E-V-U-E? But E at position 2? And we have E at position 5, but we don't know about another E. Also, ""bevue"" is a word? I think it's rare, meaning a mistake. But let's check: B(1), E(2), V(3), U(4), E(5). So it has E at position 2 and 5. But we know E is at 5, but we don't know about position 2. Also, E is not in the absent list? But we haven't tested E elsewhere. However, in ""crane"", we only had E at 5, and the other positions were absent, but that doesn't mean E can't be elsewhere. Similarly in ""house"" and ""utile"", we had E only at 5. So it's possible to have another E.

But ""BEVUE"" uses E at position 2, which we are not sure about.

Similarly, ""DEUCE"": D-E-U-C-E, but C is absent.

""JUDGE"": J-U-D-G-E? Positions: J(1), U(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). But here U is at position 2, not 4. We are looking for U at position 4.

For position 4: 
- ""BUDGE"": B-U-D-G-E? U at position 2? Not 4.
- ""FUDGE"" has U at 2.
- ""GAUZE"": G-A-U-Z-E, A absent.
- ""PLUME"": P-L-U-M-E, but L absent? L is absent from ""utile"" feedback (L(x)).

Another: ""QUEUE"": Q-U-E-U-E? But U at 2 and 4? And E at 3 and 5. But Q is available, but let's see: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). This has U at 2 and 4, and E at 3 and 5. But we know E is at 5, but we don't know about position 3. Also, E at 3 might be possible? But we haven't tested. However, the word has multiple U and E.

But it uses Q and U, E.

But we are trying to test U at position 4, so ""QUEUE"" has U at 4, but also at 2.

Similarly, ""VOGUE"": V-O-G-U-E, O absent.

""VENUE"": V-E-N-U-E, N absent.

So it's hard to find a word with U only at position 4.

Perhaps ""BEMUD"": not ending with E.

Another: ""EXUDE"": E-X-U-D-E? But E at position 1 and 5? And X, U, D. But E at position 1? We don't know. Also, ""exude"" is E-X-U-D-E, so positions: E(1), X(2), U(3), D(4), E(5). But U is at position 3? But we know U is not at position 3 from ""house"" feedback (U at position 3 was marked as '-', meaning not there). So we cannot put U at position 3. Therefore, ""exude"" is invalid because U is at 3.

Similarly, any word with U at 3 is invalid.

So for U at position 4, we need a word where U is at 4 and not at 2? Or it can be at 2 as well? But we don't know.

To keep it simple, we can choose ""FUDGE"" for the U at position 2 case.

But in ""FUDGE"", U is at position 2, which is a possibility.

We also have the option of U at position 4, but we couldn't find a common word without using absent letters.

Another word for U at position 4: ""PIQUE"" is invalid because of I.

""TOQUE"" has O.

""DUOMO"" not ending with E.

Perhaps ""BEVUE"" or ""ENSUE"" but S absent.

I think ""FUDGE"" is a good candidate: it uses new letters F, D, G, and has U at position 2.

We can also consider other words with U at position 2.

For example, ""MUDGE"": M-U-D-G-E -> similar to FUDGE but with M.

Or ""PUDGE"": P-U-D-G-E.

But ""FUDGE"" is a common word.

We could also test for U at position 4 with a word like ""QUEUE"", but it has multiple U and E, which might be less likely.

But let's stick with ""FUDGE"" for now.

However, we must consider that in ""FUDGE"", we are putting U at position 2. If U is actually at position 4, then in the feedback, U will show as absent? No, because U is in the word, so if we put it at position 2 and it's actually at 4, we will get a '-' for U (present but wrong position). Similarly, if it is at position 2, we get a '✓'.

So by guessing ""FUDGE"", we can determine the position of U.

Moreover, we test F, D, G.

Therefore, I think ""FUDGE"" is a reasonable guess.

But note: we have not tested B, M, P, W, Y, etc., but we can test them in future guesses.

So let's go with ""FUDGE"".Based on the feedback:
- U must be at position 2 or 4 (since it's not at 1, 3, or 5).
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- Absent letters: A, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T.
- Present letters: U and E.

""FUDGE"" is a valid 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Places U at position 2 (testing that possibility).
- Uses new, untested letters (F, D, G) to gain more information.
- Avoids all absent letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word in Wordle. It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)

This tells us:
1. The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
2. The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Ends with E (since we know position 5 is E)
- Does not contain C, R, A, N (since they are absent)
- Includes other common letters to get more information.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Let's think of words ending with E that avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

Common letters we might try: S, T, L, O, U, D, G, H, I, etc.

We can try to use a word that has as many new letters as possible to maximize information.

One common strategy is to try a word that includes common vowels and consonants we haven't tried yet.

We know the word has an E at the end. We haven't tried the vowels: O, I, U (A is already excluded). Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to form a word ending with E.

Possible words: 
- We could try ""SLATE"", but S, L, T are new, but note: A is excluded (from feedback: A is not in the word). So ""SLATE"" is invalid because it contains A.

We must avoid A.

Another idea: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E. This avoids C, R, A, N.

But let's check: 
- S, P, I, T are new, and E is at the end.

Alternatively, ""SHINE"" -> but H, I, N: but N is excluded (feedback: N not in word). So ""SHINE"" is invalid.

""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E. Avoids C, R, A, N. This seems good.

""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E. Also avoids the excluded letters.

We want to cover more vowels. We haven't tried O, I, U. So ""STOLE"" has O, which is a vowel we haven't tested.

But note: we also want to test common consonants. Another popular choice might be ""POISE"", but that ends with E and has O, I, S. However, P, O, I, S, E. This is also valid.

But we must avoid A and N, which we are.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has the E at the end and uses as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some words ending with E that don't contain C, R, A, N:
- BIBLE -> but B, I, B, L, E -> has two B's, which might not be ideal for information.
- TITLE -> T, I, T, L, E -> two T's.
- STOLE: S, T, O, L, E -> all unique letters.
- POISE: P, O, I, S, E -> all unique.
- QUITE: Q, U, I, T, E -> but Q is less common and U is a vowel we haven't tried.

We might prefer to test more common letters.

Another idea: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. This has two vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (H, S). But note: we know E is at the end, so we are testing H, O, U, S.

This seems good because we get to test O and U, which are vowels.

But we must avoid A, which we are, and also R, C, N.

So ""HOUSE"" is a candidate.

Alternatively, ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E.

Or ""DOUSE"" -> D, O, U, S, E.

But let's consider: we have only one E and it's at the end. We don't know if there are other E's, but the feedback only showed the last E as correct. However, it's possible that there are other E's? But the feedback for the other positions didn't show E, but in ""crane"", the E was at the end and correct. The other positions didn't have E, but that doesn't mean the word doesn't have another E. However, in the feedback, if there were another E, and we had placed it in the wrong position, it would have shown as '-'. But in ""crane"", we only had E at the end and it was correct, and the other letters were absent. So we don't know about other E's.

But note: the feedback for the first four letters were all 'x', meaning they are not in the word. So the word does not have C, R, A, N. And the E at the end is present. But we don't know if there is another E.

However, in our next guess, we can try to test for other E's? But we are forced to put E at the end. So we can only test for E in other positions by putting it in a different position? But we know the last position is E, so we must have E at the end in every guess? Actually, no. We can put E in a different position to see if there is a double E? But the feedback told us that the last letter is E, so we know that at least the last letter is E. But if we put E in another position, we might get information about whether there is another E.

However, in the next guess, we are allowed to put E in a different position? But we know that the last letter is E, so if we don't put E at the end, we are wasting the known position. It's better to use the known E at the end to free up other positions for new letters.

So I think we should keep E at the end and try new letters in the first four positions.

Therefore, we should choose a word that ends with E and uses four new letters (not C, R, A, N, and also not repeating letters unnecessarily).

We have 26 letters minus 5 we know (C, R, A, N, and we know E is in, but we are using E at the end) so we have 21 letters left. But we are using E, so we can choose from the other 20 (excluding C, R, A, N, and E? But E is allowed again? Actually, the word might have multiple E's, so we can use E again? But in our guess, we can use E again to test if there is a double E? However, in the first guess, we only had one E and it was at the end. If we put an E in the middle and it is present, then we know there is another E. But if we don't, we might not know.

But to maximize information, it's better to use all new letters. So we avoid repeating E for now.

So we want a word that ends with E, and the first four letters are new (not C, R, A, N) and not E? Actually, we can use E again? But let's avoid for now to get more information.

So the word should have four new letters in positions 1-4 and E at position 5.

We have many options.

Let me list some words:
- BITE: B, I, T, E -> but only 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So 5-letter words.

5-letter words ending with E, without C, R, A, N.

Examples:
- ""BIBLE"" -> but has two B's -> not ideal.
- ""TITLE"" -> two T's.
- ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E -> all unique.
- ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> all unique.
- ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> unique, but Q is uncommon.
- ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> all unique.
- ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> unique.
- ""DOUSE"" -> D, O, U, S, E -> unique.
- ""LOUSE"" -> L, O, U, S, E -> unique, but same as above with L.

We also have ""SLIME"", but S, L, I, M, E -> but we must avoid A? Yes, and it doesn't have A. But note: we don't know if the word has S, L, I, M. But we are testing them.

But ""SLIME"" is valid.

However, we want to test vowels. We haven't tested O, I, U. So words with O, I, U are good.

""HOUSE"" has O and U.

""POISE"" has O and I.

Which one to choose?

We can also consider the frequency of letters.

In English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A and N are out, so we focus on T, O, I, S.

We have not tried T, O, I, S, etc.

So ""TOISE"" is not a word. ""POISE"" is a word.

""HOUSE"" is a very common word.

Another one: ""SUITE"" -> S, U, I, T, E -> but that has U, I, T, S. This is also good.

But let's pick one.

I think ""HOUSE"" is a good choice because it tests H, O, U, S, and we know E is at the end.

So I'll go with ""HOUSE"".

But note: we are not forced to use the known E at the end? Actually, we can, and it's beneficial because if we get a ✓ for E again, we know it's fixed. But we already know it's fixed. However, if we don't put E at the end, then we might get feedback that E is in the word but in the wrong position? But we know it should be at the end. So it's better to use it at the end to avoid confusion and to get information about the other positions.

So I think ""HOUSE"" is a solid second guess.

Therefore, my second guess is ""HOUSE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Ensure the word ends with E (to leverage the known correct position).
2. Avoid using C, R, A, or N (since they are absent from the secret word).
3. Introduce new, common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., testing vowels like O, U, I and consonants like S, T, H).

A strong candidate is ""HOUSE"":
- It ends with E, satisfying the known position.
- It uses new letters (H, O, U, S) that haven't been tested yet.
- It covers two vowels (O, U) and common consonants (H, S), which could help reveal more about the secret word.

<guess>house</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: house -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) U(-) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
   - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
   - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

2. ""house"": H(x) O(x) U(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is again correctly placed at position 5 (confirming this).
   - H, O, S are not in the word.
   - U is in the word but not in the position guessed (position 3).

So we know:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- U is present in the word, but not at position 3.
- We have eliminated these letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S.

The letters that are in the word: We know E and U are in the word, and possibly others.

Now, we need to make a third guess. The word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E

U is in the word but not at position 3. So U must be at position 1, 2, or 4.

We need to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Includes U in position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S.
- Uses new letters to get more information.

We have eliminated consonants H, S and vowels O. We haven't tested other common vowels (I) and consonants (like T, L, P, M, D, G, etc.).

Given that U is present, we should try to determine its position by placing it in different locations.

Possible positions for U: 1, 2, or 4.

We should also test other common letters. Since the word has U and E, it might have other common letters.

We need a word using only available letters and including U and E.

Available letters: all except C, R, A, N, H, O, S. So avoid these.

Word pattern: positions 1-4: any letter except C,R,A,N,H,O,S. Position 5: E.

And U must be in one of positions 1,2,4.

Now, what words fit this?

Let me think of 5-letter words ending in E, containing U, and excluding C,R,A,N,H,O,S.

Possible words:
- ""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E -> but Q might be rare and we haven't eliminated Q.
  - However, we are avoiding S (which is eliminated), but S is not in QUITE.
- ""SUITE"": but S is eliminated, so not allowed (because S is not in the word).
- ""GLUED"": G,L,U,E,D -> ends with E? No, it ends with D. So not.
  - We need a word ending with E.

Actually, ""GLUE"" is only 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Let's list:
- ""BLUES"": But S is eliminated, so we avoid S.
- ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> E at end, and has U. But does it avoid eliminated letters? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So F,L,U,K are new, S not used. So yes.
- ""FLUTE"": F,L,U,T,E -> similar.
- ""JUICE"": J,U,I,C,E -> but C is eliminated, cannot use C.
- ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> but O and R and N are eliminated, so no.
- ""POULE"": but I think P,O? O is eliminated.

We should avoid O as well.

So words without C,R,A,N,H,O,S.

Let me try to generate words:

- With U: and ending in E.

Examples:
- ""LUCRE"": but R is eliminated -> not allowed.
- ""DUVET"": D,U,V,E,T -> but does it end with E? DUVET ends with T? No, D-U-V-E-T -> last letter is T? Actually, DUVET is 5 letters: D-U-V-E-T? But ""duvet"" ends with T, so not ending with E.

Proper words:
- ""ABUSE"": but A is eliminated.
- ""AMUSE"": but A is eliminated.
- ""BLUED"": B,L,U,E,D -> but ends with D? No, but if present tense, ""blue"" is 4 letters. ""Blued"" would be past tense, meaning made blue, but it ends with D, not E.

We need a word that naturally ends with E and has U.

Common possibilities:
- ""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> yes! Ends with E, and has U at position 3? Positions: P(1), L(2), U(3), M(4), E(5). But from guess 2, U is in the word but not in position 3. So if I put U at position 3 again, it would be wrong? Yes, in ""house"", U was at position 3 and it was wrong position. So in the secret word, U is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""PLUME"", U is at position 3 again, which we know is incorrect, so this word would have U in position 3, which is a bad guess because we know U is not at position 3. We should avoid putting U at position 3.

So we need a word with U at position 1, 2, or 4.

Position 1: U _ _ _ E
Examples: USAGE (but S and A eliminated), UNABLE (A and N eliminated), etc. Not many.

Position 2: _ U _ _ E
Examples: QUITE (Q,U,I,T,E), or BUTTE (but B,U,T,T,E? and T repeated), or FUTILE (too long? 6 letters). ""QUIET"" ends with T? No. ""QUITE"" is good: Q,U,I,T,E -> letters: Q,U,I,T,E, all not eliminated? C,R,A,N,H,O,S eliminated, so Q,U,I,T,E are all available. E is used at end, but we are testing with E at end.

Position 4: _ _ _ U E
Examples: ARGUE (A eliminated), VAGUE (A eliminated), PIQUE (P,I,Q,U,E), or toQUE (ends with UE? ""TOQUE"" is a hat, but it ends with E? Actually, ""toque"" is spelled T-O-Q-U-E? That's 5 letters: T, O, Q, U, E. But O is eliminated? In ""toque"", position 2 is O, which we cannot use because O is not in the word. So we avoid O.

Another: CLOUE? Not a word.

Better: ""GLUTE"" -> glute muscles? But ""glute"" is typically ""glutes"" plural? Also, G,L,U,T,E -> positions: G(1), L(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But U is at position 3? And we know U is not at position 3? ""GLUTE"" would have U at position 3, which we should avoid.

So we must avoid U at position 3.

So for position 2: _ U _ _ E
Words: QUITE (Q,U,I,T,E) -> this works? But Q is not common. Another: ""DUVET"" doesn't end with E? ""DUVET"" ends with T.

What about ""SUITE""? But S is eliminated.

""BUYER"" ends with R? Not E.

""JUICE"" has C? C is eliminated.

""QUILT"" ends with T? No.

Another: ""LUCKY"" doesn't end with E.

Let me think: Valid words for position 2: U at 2.
- Maybe ""MUTED"": M,U,T,E,D -> ends with D? No, but ""muted"" is M-U-T-E-D, so E in position 4? Then ends with D. Not E at end.

We need the word to end with E.

Perhaps: ""PAUSE"" but P,A,U,S,E -> A and S eliminated.

So difficult without position 3 U.

Another for position 4: _ _ _ U E
Words: ""ENSUE"" -> E,N,S,U,E but N and S eliminated and also E at position 1? But we don't know about E at beginning. However, E at position 1? But in ""crane"", E was at 5 and we had C,R,A,N at other positions? But we don't know if E appears elsewhere.

Possible word: ""issue"" but ends with E? I-S-S-U-E? Has S eliminated.

Let's try: ""PIQUE"" -> P,I,Q,U,E -> positions: P(1), I(2), Q(3), U(4), E(5). This fits: U at position 4, and ends with E, and letters: P, I, Q, U, E. Are they eliminated? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So P,I,Q,U,E are all okay? E is used at end.

Q is a less common letter, but it's acceptable.

Another possibility: ""BIQUE""? Not a word.

""TOQUE"" has O.

So ""PIQUE"" might work.

Position 1: U _ _ _ E
Words: ""USUAL"" doesn't end with E? Or ""URBAN"" doesn't end with E? How about ""UNCLE"" -> U,N,C,L,E -> N and C eliminated. ""UNLIT"" ends with T? No.

Another: ""UTILE"": U,T,I,L,E -> positions: U(1), T(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). This word? Yes, ""utile"" means useful. So U,T,I,L,E. Avoids eliminated letters? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So U,T,I,L,E are all allowed. And U is at position 1.

Similarly, ""UNITE"" -> U,N,I,T,E -> N eliminated? Yes, N is eliminated.

So ""UTILE"" or ""PIQUE"".

Now, which one to choose? We want to test new letters.

In ""PIQUE"": letters P, I, Q, U, E. We already know U and E are in the word. So we are testing P, I, Q.

In ""UTILE"": letters U,T,I,L,E. We know U and E, so testing T, I, L.

Comparing:
- ""PIQUE"": introduces P, I, Q -> Q is infrequent, so likely less information except for Q. P and I are more common.
- ""UTILE"": introduces T, I, L -> T and L are very common letters.

Also, we have not tested I (a vowel) yet, so testing I is good.

But both ""UTILE"" and ""PIQUE"" test I.

""UTILE"" tests T and L, which are more common than Q and P.

Moreover, in ""UTILE"", U is at position 1, which we are testing.

We also have not tested L or T.

Therefore, ""UTILE"" seems better because it tests more common letters.

But earlier we have avoided Q.

Another word: ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> positions: G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). This avoids position 3 for U? Wait, U is at position 2? So in ""GUILE"", U is at position 2.

Is that acceptable? Yes, we need U at 1,2, or 4.

So ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E.

Letters: G,U,I,L,E. Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S -> G,U,I,L,E are all okay.

Similarly, ""BUILD"" ends with D? Not E.

So ""GUILE"" is a word.

Also, ""GUISE"" but S eliminated.

""GUILE"" is good.

Now, compare ""UTILE"" (U at 1) and ""GUILE"" (U at 2).

We have position flexibility.

Another one: ""FLUME"" but U at position 3? F,L,U,M,E -> U at 3, which we avoid.

""PLUMB"" not ending with E.

""DUCHY"" doesn't end with E.

Back to available words:
- Position 2: _ U _ _ E: ""QUITE"" (with Q), ""GUILE"" (G,U,I,L,E)
- Position 1: U _ _ _ E: ""UTILE"" (U,T,I,L,E)
- Position 4: _ _ _ U E: ""PIQUE"" (P,I,Q,U,E)

We could also consider ""SUGAR"" but doesn't end with E and S eliminated.

I think ""UTILE"" and ""GUILE"" are better options.

Let's choose between ""UTILE"" and ""GUILE"".

Both introduce T, I, L and G, I, L respectively? ""UTILE"": U,T,I,L,E -> tests T, I, L. ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> tests G, I, L.

So UTILE tests T and the others, GUILE tests G and L/I.

We haven't tested T, L, G, I.

I is a vowel and important to test.

Also, L and T are common consonants.

To decide, we can consider frequency. T is more common than G.

Also, by testing T, we might get more information.

Similarly, G is less common than T.

Therefore, perhaps ""UTILE"" is better because it uses the more common T.

We could think of other words: for example, ""TIMED"" wouldn't work because M,E,D? Positions: but ends with D? No.

Another word with U: ""BEIGE"" doesn't have U.

List:
- ""QUITE"": Q is less common.
- ""PIQUE"": Q again.
- ""GUILE"": G is acceptable, but less common than T.

So ""UTILE"": U, T, I, L, E.

Or ""CUTIE"" but C eliminated.

Therefore, I think ""UTILE"" is a good choice: uses new letters T, I, L (common) and has U at position 1 and E at 5.

So we guess ""UTILE"".

But note: in ""UTILE"", U is at position 1. We don't know if that is correct, but we are testing.

Also, if U is not at 1, then it must be at 2 or 4.

By putting U at 1, we can confirm or eliminate that position.

Similarly, we get information about T, I, L.

Therefore, let's go with ""UTILE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is correctly placed at position 5 (E(✓)), and C, R, A, N are absent (x). So the secret word ends with E and excludes C, R, A, N.
- **Guess 2 (house)**: E is confirmed at position 5 (E(✓)), U is present but not at position 3 (U(-)), and H, O, S are absent (x). This means U is in the secret word but must be at position 1, 2, or 4 (since it's not at 3), and H, O, S are excluded.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (position 5).
- U must be included at position 1, 2, or 4 (avoiding position 3).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S (all absent based on feedback).
- Focus on testing new common letters (e.g., vowels like I and consonants like T, L, D) to maximize information.

Considering these constraints:
- **UTILE** fits: U in position 1 (testing if U is at start), T in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, E in position 5.
- All letters are eligible: U (known present), T, I, L are new (not excluded), and E is fixed at position 5.
- This tests U at a different position (position 1) and introduces common consonants (T, L) and the vowel (I) for broader coverage.

Alternative words like GUILE (U at position 2) or PIQUE (U at position 4 with rare Q) were considered, but UTILE uses the more common letters T and L over G/Q.

<guess>utile</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: house -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) U(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: utile -> FEEDBACK: U(-) T(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter). C, R, A, N are absent.

2. ""house"":
   - H(x), O(x), U(-), S(x), E(✓)
   → E is correct at position 5. U is present but not at position 3. H, O, S are absent.

3. ""utile"":
   - U(-), T(x), I(x), L(x), E(✓)
   → E is correct at position 5. U is present but not at position 1 (since we tried U at position 1 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but wrong position). T, I, L are absent.

Summary of known information:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- U is in the word, but not at position 1 or 3 (from ""utile"" and ""house"").
- Therefore, U must be at position 2 or 4 (since position 5 is E, and positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S, T, I, L (from the x's in all guesses).
- Present letters: U and E (E at position 5, U somewhere else).

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains U at position 2 or 4.
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, H, O, S, T, I, L.
- We have not tested many other letters, so we should introduce new common letters.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 10 absent letters (C,R,A,N,H,O,S,T,I,L) and minus E and U (which we know are in, but we can use them again if needed). However, we must avoid the absent letters.

List of absent letters: A, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T (10 letters).

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (14 letters). Plus we know U and E are in, but we are using E at the end.

The word must have U at position 2 or 4.

We need to test new letters to find the secret word.

Possible positions:
Case 1: U at position 2: _ U _ _ E
Case 2: U at position 4: _ _ _ U E

We should choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible from the available set.

Common letters from the remaining: B, D, F, G, M, P, W, Y are more common than others.

We can try to form words for both cases.

First, let's try U at position 2: _ U _ _ E
- We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters from B,D,F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (avoiding the absent list).
- Examples: 
  - ""BUYER"" but ends with R? Not E. Also, Y is available, but ""buyer"" is B-U-Y-E-R, so ends with R? No, it's 5 letters: B-U-Y-E-R? Then position 5 is R, not E. So not.
  - ""DUVET"" ends with T? D-U-V-E-T, so position 5 is T, not E.
  - ""JUMPS"" ends with S? Not E, and S is absent.
  - ""MUNGE""? M-U-N-G-E but N is absent? N is in the absent list, so no.
  - ""PURGE"": P-U-R-G-E but R is absent? R is in absent list.
  - ""FUDGE"": F-U-D-G-E -> positions: F(1), U(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). This seems good? Letters: F, U, D, G, E. Check absent: F, D, G are not in the absent list. U and E are known. So yes.

""FUDGE"" is a word: a type of candy or to fake something.

But we have U at position 2, which is a possibility.

Now, U at position 4: _ _ _ U E
- Fill positions 1,2,3 with available letters.
- Examples:
  - ""ARGUE"" but A and R absent.
  - ""BEGIN"" ends with N? Not E.
  - ""BEIGE"" no U.
  - ""PIQUE"": P-I-Q-U-E, but I is absent? From ""utile"", I is absent (I(x)), so we cannot use I. So ""PIQUE"" is invalid because of I.
  - ""VAGUE"": V-A-G-U-E, but A is absent.
  - ""FUGUE"": F-U-G-U-E? Positions: F(1), U(2), G(3), U(4), E(5). But U is repeated? And we don't know if the word has two U's. But in feedback, we only know one U is present. However, it could have two. But let's see: ""FUGUE"" has U at position 2 and 4? But we are trying U at position 4, but in this word, U is also at 2? Actually, ""FUGUE"" is F-U-G-U-E, so U at 2 and 4. But we are not sure if the secret word has two U's. Also, we are testing U at position 4, but if we put U at position 2, it might be correct or not? But we are not constraining position 2 here.

But we are trying to test U at position 4, so we can have a word with U only at position 4? Or with U at another position? But we know U is not at position 1 or 3, so it could be at 2 and 4? But we don't know.

To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with U only at position 4.

But let's list possible words for _ _ _ U E:
- ""BEVUE"": B-E-V-U-E? But E at position 2? And we have E at position 5, but we don't know about another E. Also, ""bevue"" is a word? I think it's rare, meaning a mistake. But let's check: B(1), E(2), V(3), U(4), E(5). So it has E at position 2 and 5. But we know E is at 5, but we don't know about position 2. Also, E is not in the absent list? But we haven't tested E elsewhere. However, in ""crane"", we only had E at 5, and the other positions were absent, but that doesn't mean E can't be elsewhere. Similarly in ""house"" and ""utile"", we had E only at 5. So it's possible to have another E.

But ""BEVUE"" uses E at position 2, which we are not sure about.

Similarly, ""DEUCE"": D-E-U-C-E, but C is absent.

""JUDGE"": J-U-D-G-E? Positions: J(1), U(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). But here U is at position 2, not 4. We are looking for U at position 4.

For position 4: 
- ""BUDGE"": B-U-D-G-E? U at position 2? Not 4.
- ""FUDGE"" has U at 2.
- ""GAUZE"": G-A-U-Z-E, A absent.
- ""PLUME"": P-L-U-M-E, but L absent? L is absent from ""utile"" feedback (L(x)).

Another: ""QUEUE"": Q-U-E-U-E? But U at 2 and 4? And E at 3 and 5. But Q is available, but let's see: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). This has U at 2 and 4, and E at 3 and 5. But we know E is at 5, but we don't know about position 3. Also, E at 3 might be possible? But we haven't tested. However, the word has multiple U and E.

But it uses Q and U, E.

But we are trying to test U at position 4, so ""QUEUE"" has U at 4, but also at 2.

Similarly, ""VOGUE"": V-O-G-U-E, O absent.

""VENUE"": V-E-N-U-E, N absent.

So it's hard to find a word with U only at position 4.

Perhaps ""BEMUD"": not ending with E.

Another: ""EXUDE"": E-X-U-D-E? But E at position 1 and 5? And X, U, D. But E at position 1? We don't know. Also, ""exude"" is E-X-U-D-E, so positions: E(1), X(2), U(3), D(4), E(5). But U is at position 3? But we know U is not at position 3 from ""house"" feedback (U at position 3 was marked as '-', meaning not there). So we cannot put U at position 3. Therefore, ""exude"" is invalid because U is at 3.

Similarly, any word with U at 3 is invalid.

So for U at position 4, we need a word where U is at 4 and not at 2? Or it can be at 2 as well? But we don't know.

To keep it simple, we can choose ""FUDGE"" for the U at position 2 case.

But in ""FUDGE"", U is at position 2, which is a possibility.

We also have the option of U at position 4, but we couldn't find a common word without using absent letters.

Another word for U at position 4: ""PIQUE"" is invalid because of I.

""TOQUE"" has O.

""DUOMO"" not ending with E.

Perhaps ""BEVUE"" or ""ENSUE"" but S absent.

I think ""FUDGE"" is a good candidate: it uses new letters F, D, G, and has U at position 2.

We can also consider other words with U at position 2.

For example, ""MUDGE"": M-U-D-G-E -> similar to FUDGE but with M.

Or ""PUDGE"": P-U-D-G-E.

But ""FUDGE"" is a common word.

We could also test for U at position 4 with a word like ""QUEUE"", but it has multiple U and E, which might be less likely.

But let's stick with ""FUDGE"" for now.

However, we must consider that in ""FUDGE"", we are putting U at position 2. If U is actually at position 4, then in the feedback, U will show as absent? No, because U is in the word, so if we put it at position 2 and it's actually at 4, we will get a '-' for U (present but wrong position). Similarly, if it is at position 2, we get a '✓'.

So by guessing ""FUDGE"", we can determine the position of U.

Moreover, we test F, D, G.

Therefore, I think ""FUDGE"" is a reasonable guess.

But note: we have not tested B, M, P, W, Y, etc., but we can test them in future guesses.

So let's go with ""FUDGE"".Based on the feedback:
- U must be at position 2 or 4 (since it's not at 1, 3, or 5).
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- Absent letters: A, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T.
- Present letters: U and E.

""FUDGE"" is a valid 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Places U at position 2 (testing that possibility).
- Uses new, untested letters (F, D, G) to gain more information.
- Avoids all absent letters.

<guess>fudge</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is correct and in position 5 (E(✓)). C, R, A, N are absent (x).
   - **Guess 2 (house)**: E is correct in position 5 (E(✓)). U is present but not in position 3 (U(-)). H, O, S are absent (x).
   - **Guess 3 (utile)**: E is correct in position 5 (E(✓)). U is present but not in position 1 (U(-)). T, I, L are absent (x).

2. **Key Insights:**
   - **Position 5 is E**: The secret word ends with E.
   - **U is present but position unknown**: U cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (based on feedback). Therefore, U must be in position 2 or 4.
   - **Absent letters (10 total)**: A, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T (eliminated from all guesses).
   - **Present letters**: Only U and E are confirmed so far (E is fixed at position 5).
   - **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (14 letters remain).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - **Prioritize testing U's position**: Since U must be in position 2 or 4, the guess should place U in one of these spots to narrow it down.
   - **Maximize new information**: Use untested common consonants (e.g., D, F, G, M, P) to cover more ground.
   - **Avoid absent letters**: Ensure no eliminated letters (A, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T) are used.
   - **Word structure**: The word must end with E (position 5).

4. **Candidate Words:**
   - **U in position 2 (pattern: _ U _ _ E)**: 
     - ""FUDGE"" (F, U, D, G, E) fits perfectly: Tests U at position 2 and introduces new common letters F, D, G.
     - Alternatives like ""MUDGE"" or ""PUDGE"" were considered, but ""FUDGE"" is a common word with high-frequency letters.
   - **U in position 4 (pattern: _ _ _ U E)**:
     - Fewer options exist (e.g., ""QUEUE"" or ""BEVUE""), but these use rare letters (Q) or repeat E, reducing information gain. ""FUDGE"" is stronger for this guess.

5. **Why ""FUDGE""?**
   - Tests U at position 2: If U is correct here, we get a ✓; if not (and U is at position 4), we get a (-), resolving U's position.
   - Introduces three new letters (F, D, G), which are common consonants.
   - Avoids all absent letters and reuses E (correctly placed) and U (known present).
   - If ""FUDGE"" is incorrect, feedback on F, D, and G will significantly narrow possibilities for future guesses.

The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).\n2. The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.\n\nWe need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Ends with E (since we know position 5 is E)\n- Does not contain C, R, A, N (since they are absent)\n- Includes other common letters to get more information.\n\nWe also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of words ending with E that avoid the letters C, R, A, N.\n\nCommon letters we might try: S, T, L, O, U, D, G, H, I, etc.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has as many new letters as possible to maximize information.\n\nOne common strategy is to try a word that includes common vowels and consonants we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nWe know the word has an E at the end. We haven\'t tried the vowels: O, I, U (A is already excluded). Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word ending with E.\n\nPossible words: \n- We could try ""SLATE"", but S, L, T are new, but note: A is excluded (from feedback: A is not in the word). So ""SLATE"" is invalid because it contains A.\n\nWe must avoid A.\n\nAnother idea: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E. This avoids C, R, A, N.\n\nBut let\'s check: \n- S, P, I, T are new, and E is at the end.\n\nAlternatively, ""SHINE"" -> but H, I, N: but N is excluded (feedback: N not in word). So ""SHINE"" is invalid.\n\n""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E. Avoids C, R, A, N. This seems good.\n\n""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E. Also avoids the excluded letters.\n\nWe want to cover more vowels. We haven\'t tried O, I, U. So ""STOLE"" has O, which is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\nBut note: we also want to test common consonants. Another popular choice might be ""POISE"", but that ends with E and has O, I, S. However, P, O, I, S, E. This is also valid.\n\nBut we must avoid A and N, which we are.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has the E at the end and uses as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet me list some words ending with E that don\'t contain C, R, A, N:\n- BIBLE -> but B, I, B, L, E -> has two B\'s, which might not be ideal for information.\n- TITLE -> T, I, T, L, E -> two T\'s.\n- STOLE: S, T, O, L, E -> all unique letters.\n- POISE: P, O, I, S, E -> all unique.\n- QUITE: Q, U, I, T, E -> but Q is less common and U is a vowel we haven\'t tried.\n\nWe might prefer to test more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. This has two vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (H, S). But note: we know E is at the end, so we are testing H, O, U, S.\n\nThis seems good because we get to test O and U, which are vowels.\n\nBut we must avoid A, which we are, and also R, C, N.\n\nSo ""HOUSE"" is a candidate.\n\nAlternatively, ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E.\n\nOr ""DOUSE"" -> D, O, U, S, E.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we have only one E and it\'s at the end. We don\'t know if there are other E\'s, but the feedback only showed the last E as correct. However, it\'s possible that there are other E\'s? But the feedback for the other positions didn\'t show E, but in ""crane"", the E was at the end and correct. The other positions didn\'t have E, but that doesn\'t mean the word doesn\'t have another E. However, in the feedback, if there were another E, and we had placed it in the wrong position, it would have shown as \'-\'. But in ""crane"", we only had E at the end and it was correct, and the other letters were absent. So we don\'t know about other E\'s.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first four letters were all \'x\', meaning they are not in the word. So the word does not have C, R, A, N. And the E at the end is present. But we don\'t know if there is another E.\n\nHowever, in our next guess, we can try to test for other E\'s? But we are forced to put E at the end. So we can only test for E in other positions by putting it in a different position? But we know the last position is E, so we must have E at the end in every guess? Actually, no. We can put E in a different position to see if there is a double E? But the feedback told us that the last letter is E, so we know that at least the last letter is E. But if we put E in another position, we might get information about whether there is another E.\n\nHowever, in the next guess, we are allowed to put E in a different position? But we know that the last letter is E, so if we don\'t put E at the end, we are wasting the known position. It\'s better to use the known E at the end to free up other positions for new letters.\n\nSo I think we should keep E at the end and try new letters in the first four positions.\n\nTherefore, we should choose a word that ends with E and uses four new letters (not C, R, A, N, and also not repeating letters unnecessarily).\n\nWe have 26 letters minus 5 we know (C, R, A, N, and we know E is in, but we are using E at the end) so we have 21 letters left. But we are using E, so we can choose from the other 20 (excluding C, R, A, N, and E? But E is allowed again? Actually, the word might have multiple E\'s, so we can use E again? But in our guess, we can use E again to test if there is a double E? However, in the first guess, we only had one E and it was at the end. If we put an E in the middle and it is present, then we know there is another E. But if we don\'t, we might not know.\n\nBut to maximize information, it\'s better to use all new letters. So we avoid repeating E for now.\n\nSo we want a word that ends with E, and the first four letters are new (not C, R, A, N) and not E? Actually, we can use E again? But let\'s avoid for now to get more information.\n\nSo the word should have four new letters in positions 1-4 and E at position 5.\n\nWe have many options.\n\nLet me list some words:\n- BITE: B, I, T, E -> but only 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So 5-letter words.\n\n5-letter words ending with E, without C, R, A, N.\n\nExamples:\n- ""BIBLE"" -> but has two B\'s -> not ideal.\n- ""TITLE"" -> two T\'s.\n- ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E -> all unique.\n- ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> all unique.\n- ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> unique, but Q is uncommon.\n- ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> all unique.\n- ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> unique.\n- ""DOUSE"" -> D, O, U, S, E -> unique.\n- ""LOUSE"" -> L, O, U, S, E -> unique, but same as above with L.\n\nWe also have ""SLIME"", but S, L, I, M, E -> but we must avoid A? Yes, and it doesn\'t have A. But note: we don\'t know if the word has S, L, I, M. But we are testing them.\n\nBut ""SLIME"" is valid.\n\nHowever, we want to test vowels. We haven\'t tested O, I, U. So words with O, I, U are good.\n\n""HOUSE"" has O and U.\n\n""POISE"" has O and I.\n\nWhich one to choose?\n\nWe can also consider the frequency of letters.\n\nIn English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A and N are out, so we focus on T, O, I, S.\n\nWe have not tried T, O, I, S, etc.\n\nSo ""TOISE"" is not a word. ""POISE"" is a word.\n\n""HOUSE"" is a very common word.\n\nAnother one: ""SUITE"" -> S, U, I, T, E -> but that has U, I, T, S. This is also good.\n\nBut let\'s pick one.\n\nI think ""HOUSE"" is a good choice because it tests H, O, U, S, and we know E is at the end.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""HOUSE"".\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use the known E at the end? Actually, we can, and it\'s beneficial because if we get a ✓ for E again, we know it\'s fixed. But we already know it\'s fixed. However, if we don\'t put E at the end, then we might get feedback that E is in the word but in the wrong position? But we know it should be at the end. So it\'s better to use it at the end to avoid confusion and to get information about the other positions.\n\nSo I think ""HOUSE"" is a solid second guess.\n\nTherefore, my second guess is ""HOUSE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).\n- C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n1. Ensure the word ends with E (to leverage the known correct position).\n2. Avoid using C, R, A, or N (since they are absent from the secret word).\n3. Introduce new, common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., testing vowels like O, U, I and consonants like S, T, H).\n\nA strong candidate is ""HOUSE"":\n- It ends with E, satisfying the known position.\n- It uses new letters (H, O, U, S) that haven\'t been tested yet.\n- It covers two vowels (O, U) and common consonants (H, S), which could help reveal more about the secret word.\n\n<guess>house</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: house -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) U(-) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1.

The word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E\n\nU is in the word but not at position 3. So U must be at position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Ends with E (position 5).\n- Includes U in position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).\n- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S.\n- Uses new letters to get more information.\n\nWe have eliminated consonants H, S and vowels O.

Since the word has U and E, it might have other common letters.\n\nWe need a word using only available letters and including U and E.\n\nAvailable letters: all except C, R, A, N, H, O, S. So avoid these.\n\nWord pattern: positions 1-4: any letter except C,R,A,N,H,O,S. Position 5: E.\n\nAnd U must be in one of positions 1,2,4.\n\nNow, what words fit this?\n\nLet me think of 5-letter words ending in E, containing U, and excluding C,R,A,N,H,O,S.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E -> but Q might be rare and we haven\'t eliminated Q.\n  - However, we are avoiding S (which is eliminated), but S is not in QUITE.\n- ""SUITE"": but S is eliminated, so not allowed (because S is not in the word).\n- ""GLUED"": G,L,U,E,D -> ends with E? No, it ends with D. So not.\n  - We need a word ending with E.\n\nActually, ""GLUE"" is only 4 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\nLet\'s list:\n- ""BLUES"": But S is eliminated, so we avoid S.\n- ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> E at end, and has U. But does it avoid eliminated letters? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So F,L,U,K are new, S not used. So yes.\n- ""FLUTE"": F,L,U,T,E -> similar.\n- ""JUICE"": J,U,I,C,E -> but C is eliminated, cannot use C.\n- ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> but O and R and N are eliminated, so no.\n- ""POULE"": but I think P,O? O is eliminated.\n\nWe should avoid O as well.\n\nSo words without C,R,A,N,H,O,S.\n\nLet me try to generate words:\n\n- With U: and ending in E.\n\nExamples:\n- ""LUCRE"": but R is eliminated -> not allowed.\n- ""DUVET"": D,U,V,E,T -> but does it end with E? DUVET ends with T? No, D-U-V-E-T -> last letter is T? Actually, DUVET is 5 letters: D-U-V-E-T? But ""duvet"" ends with T, so not ending with E.\n\nProper words:\n- ""ABUSE"": but A is eliminated.\n- ""AMUSE"": but A is eliminated.\n- ""BLUED"": B,L,U,E,D -> but ends with D? No, but if present tense, ""blue"" is 4 letters. ""Blued"" would be past tense, meaning made blue, but it ends with D, not E.\n\nWe need a word that naturally ends with E and has U.\n\nCommon possibilities:\n- ""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> yes! Ends with E, and has U at position 3? Positions: P(1), L(2), U(3), M(4), E(5). But from guess 2, U is in the word but not in position 3. So if I put U at position 3 again, it would be wrong? Yes, in ""house"", U was at position 3 and it was wrong position. So in the secret word, U is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""PLUME"", U is at position 3 again, which we know is incorrect, so this word would have U in position 3, which is a bad guess because we know U is not at position 3. We should avoid putting U at position 3.\n\nSo we need a word with U at position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nPosition 1: U _ _ _ E\nExamples: USAGE (but S and A eliminated), UNABLE (A and N eliminated), etc. Not many.\n\nPosition 2: _ U _ _ E\nExamples: QUITE (Q,U,I,T,E), or BUTTE (but B,U,T,T,E? and T repeated), or FUTILE (too long? 6 letters). ""QUIET"" ends with T? No. ""QUITE"" is good: Q,U,I,T,E -> letters: Q,U,I,T,E, all not eliminated? C,R,A,N,H,O,S eliminated, so Q,U,I,T,E are all available. E is used at end, but we are testing with E at end.\n\nPosition 4: _ _ _ U E\nExamples: ARGUE (A eliminated), VAGUE (A eliminated), PIQUE (P,I,Q,U,E), or toQUE (ends with UE? ""TOQUE"" is a hat, but it ends with E? Actually, ""toque"" is spelled T-O-Q-U-E? That\'s 5 letters: T, O, Q, U, E. But O is eliminated? In ""toque"", position 2 is O, which we cannot use because O is not in the word. So we avoid O.\n\nAnother: CLOUE? Not a word.\n\nBetter: ""GLUTE"" -> glute muscles? But ""glute"" is typically ""glutes"" plural? Also, G,L,U,T,E -> positions: G(1), L(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But U is at position 3? And we know U is not at position 3? ""GLUTE"" would have U at position 3, which we should avoid.\n\nSo we must avoid U at position 3.\n\nSo for position 2: _ U _ _ E\nWords: QUITE (Q,U,I,T,E) -> this works? But Q is not common. Another: ""DUVET"" doesn\'t end with E? ""DUVET"" ends with T.\n\nWhat about ""SUITE""? But S is eliminated.\n\n""BUYER"" ends with R? Not E.\n\n""JUICE"" has C? C is eliminated.\n\n""QUILT"" ends with T? No.\n\nAnother: ""LUCKY"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\nLet me think: Valid words for position 2: U at 2.\n- Maybe ""MUTED"": M,U,T,E,D -> ends with D? No, but ""muted"" is M-U-T-E-D, so E in position 4? Then ends with D. Not E at end.\n\nWe need the word to end with E.\n\nPerhaps: ""PAUSE"" but P,A,U,S,E -> A and S eliminated.\n\nSo difficult without position 3 U.\n\nAnother for position 4: _ _ _ U E\nWords: ""ENSUE"" -> E,N,S,U,E but N and S eliminated and also E at position 1? But we don\'t know about E at beginning. However, E at position 1? But in ""crane"", E was at 5 and we had C,R,A,N at other positions? But we don\'t know if E appears elsewhere.\n\nPossible word: ""issue"" but ends with E? I-S-S-U-E? Has S eliminated.\n\nLet\'s try: ""PIQUE"" -> P,I,Q,U,E -> positions: P(1), I(2), Q(3), U(4), E(5). This fits: U at position 4, and ends with E, and letters: P, I, Q, U, E. Are they eliminated? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So P,I,Q,U,E are all okay? E is used at end.\n\nQ is a less common letter, but it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother possibility: ""BIQUE""? Not a word.\n\n""TOQUE"" has O.\n\nSo ""PIQUE"" might work.\n\nPosition 1: U _ _ _ E\nWords: ""USUAL"" doesn\'t end with E? Or ""URBAN"" doesn\'t end with E? How about ""UNCLE"" -> U,N,C,L,E -> N and C eliminated. ""UNLIT"" ends with T? No.\n\nAnother: ""UTILE"": U,T,I,L,E -> positions: U(1), T(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). This word? Yes, ""utile"" means useful. So U,T,I,L,E. Avoids eliminated letters? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S. So U,T,I,L,E are all allowed. And U is at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, ""UNITE"" -> U,N,I,T,E -> N eliminated? Yes, N is eliminated.\n\nSo ""UTILE"" or ""PIQUE"".\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test new letters.\n\nIn ""PIQUE"": letters P, I, Q, U, E. We already know U and E are in the word. So we are testing P, I, Q.\n\nIn ""UTILE"": letters U,T,I,L,E. We know U and E, so testing T, I, L.\n\nComparing:\n- ""PIQUE"": introduces P, I, Q -> Q is infrequent, so likely less information except for Q. P and I are more common.\n- ""UTILE"": introduces T, I, L -> T and L are very common letters.\n\nAlso, we have not tested I (a vowel) yet, so testing I is good.\n\nBut both ""UTILE"" and ""PIQUE"" test I.\n\n""UTILE"" tests T and L, which are more common than Q and P.\n\nMoreover, in ""UTILE"", U is at position 1, which we are testing.\n\nWe also have not tested L or T.\n\nTherefore, ""UTILE"" seems better because it tests more common letters.\n\nBut earlier we have avoided Q.\n\nAnother word: ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> positions: G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). This avoids position 3 for U? Wait, U is at position 2? So in ""GUILE"", U is at position 2.\n\nIs that acceptable? Yes, we need U at 1,2, or 4.\n\nSo ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E.\n\nLetters: G,U,I,L,E. Eliminated: C,R,A,N,H,O,S -> G,U,I,L,E are all okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""BUILD"" ends with D? Not E.\n\nSo ""GUILE"" is a word.\n\nAlso, ""GUISE"" but S eliminated.\n\n""GUILE"" is good.\n\nNow, compare ""UTILE"" (U at 1) and ""GUILE"" (U at 2).\n\nWe have position flexibility.\n\nAnother one: ""FLUME"" but U at position 3? F,L,U,M,E -> U at 3, which we avoid.\n\n""PLUMB"" not ending with E.\n\n""DUCHY"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\nBack to available words:\n- Position 2: _ U _ _ E: ""QUITE"" (with Q), ""GUILE"" (G,U,I,L,E)\n- Position 1: U _ _ _ E: ""UTILE"" (U,T,I,L,E)\n- Position 4: _ _ _ U E: ""PIQUE"" (P,I,Q,U,E)\n\nWe could also consider ""SUGAR"" but doesn\'t end with E and S eliminated.\n\nI think ""UTILE"" and ""GUILE"" are better options.\n\nLet\'s choose between ""UTILE"" and ""GUILE"".\n\nBoth introduce T, I, L and G, I, L respectively? ""UTILE"": U,T,I,L,E -> tests T, I, L. ""GUILE"": G,U,I,L,E -> tests G, I, L.\n\nSo UTILE tests T and the others, GUILE tests G and L/I.\n\nWe haven\'t tested T, L, G, I.\n\nI is a vowel and important to test.\n\nAlso, L and T are common consonants.\n\nTo decide, we can consider frequency. T is more common than G.\n\nAlso, by testing T, we might get more information.\n\nSimilarly, G is less common than T.\n\nTherefore, perhaps ""UTILE"" is better because it uses the more common T.\n\nWe could think of other words: for example, ""TIMED"" wouldn\'t work because M,E,D? Positions: but ends with D? No.\n\nAnother word with U: ""BEIGE"" doesn\'t have U.\n\nList:\n- ""QUITE"": Q is less common.\n- ""PIQUE"": Q again.\n- ""GUILE"": G is acceptable, but less common than T.\n\nSo ""UTILE"": U, T, I, L, E.\n\nOr ""CUTIE"" but C eliminated.\n\nTherefore, I think ""UTILE"" is a good choice: uses new letters T, I, L (common) and has U at position 1 and E at 5.\n\nSo we guess ""UTILE"".\n\nBut note: in ""UTILE"", U is at position 1. We don\'t know if that is correct, but we are testing.\n\nAlso, if U is not at 1, then it must be at 2 or 4.\n\nBy putting U at 1, we can confirm or eliminate that position.\n\nSimilarly, we get information about T, I, L.\n\nTherefore, let\'s go with ""UTILE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is correctly placed at position 5 (E(✓)), and C, R, A, N are absent (x). So the secret word ends with E and excludes C, R, A, N.\n- **Guess 2 (house)**: E is confirmed at position 5 (E(✓)), U is present but not at position 3 (U(-)), and H, O, S are absent (x). This means U is in the secret word but must be at position 1, 2, or 4 (since it\'s not at 3), and H, O, S are excluded.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with E (position 5).\n- U must be included at position 1, 2, or 4 (avoiding position 3).\n- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, S (all absent based on feedback).\n- Focus on testing new common letters (e.g., vowels like I and consonants like T, L, D) to maximize information.\n\nConsidering these constraints:\n- **UTILE** fits: U in position 1 (testing if U is at start), T in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, E in position 5.\n- All letters are eligible: U (known present), T, I, L are new (not excluded), and E is fixed at position 5.\n- This tests U at a different position (position 1) and introduces common consonants (T, L) and the vowel (I) for broader coverage.\n\nAlternative words like GUILE (U at position 2) or PIQUE (U at position 4 with rare Q) were considered, but UTILE uses the more common letters T and L over G/Q.\n\n<guess>utile</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: house -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) U(-) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: utile -> FEEDBACK: U(-) T(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\n1.

Not E. Also, Y is available, but ""buyer"" is B-U-Y-E-R, so ends with R? No, it\'s 5 letters: B-U-Y-E-R? Then position 5 is R, not E. So not.\n  - ""DUVET"" ends with T? D-U-V-E-T, so position 5 is T, not E.\n  - ""JUMPS"" ends with S? Not E, and S is absent.\n  - ""MUNGE""? M-U-N-G-E but N is absent? N is in the absent list, so no.\n  - ""PURGE"": P-U-R-G-E but R is absent? R is in absent list.\n  - ""FUDGE"": F-U-D-G-E -> positions: F(1), U(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). This seems good? Letters: F, U, D, G, E. Check absent: F, D, G are not in the absent list. U and E are known. So yes.\n\n""FUDGE"" is a word: a type of candy or to fake something.\n\nBut we have U at position 2, which is a possibility.\n\nNow, U at position 4: _ _ _ U E\n- Fill positions 1,2,3 with available letters.\n- Examples:\n  - ""ARGUE"" but A and R absent.\n  - ""BEGIN"" ends with N? Not E.\n  - ""BEIGE"" no U.\n  - ""PIQUE"": P-I-Q-U-E, but I is absent? From ""utile"", I is absent (I(x)), so we cannot use I. So ""PIQUE"" is invalid because of I.\n  - ""VAGUE"": V-A-G-U-E, but A is absent.\n  - ""FUGUE"": F-U-G-U-E? Positions: F(1), U(2), G(3), U(4), E(5). But U is repeated? And we don\'t know if the word has two U\'s. But in feedback, we only know one U is present. However, it could have two. But let\'s see: ""FUGUE"" has U at position 2 and 4? But we are trying U at position 4, but in this word, U is also at 2? Actually, ""FUGUE"" is F-U-G-U-E, so U at 2 and 4. But we are not sure if the secret word has two U\'s. Also, we are testing U at position 4, but if we put U at position 2, it might be correct or not? But we are not constraining position 2 here.\n\nBut we are trying to test U at position 4, so we can have a word with U only at position 4? Or with U at another position? But we know U is not at position 1 or 3, so it could be at 2 and 4? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo avoid confusion, we might prefer a word with U only at position 4.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words for _ _ _ U E:\n- ""BEVUE"": B-E-V-U-E? But E at position 2? And we have E at position 5, but we don\'t know about another E. Also, ""bevue"" is a word? I think it\'s rare, meaning a mistake. But let\'s check: B(1), E(2), V(3), U(4), E(5). So it has E at position 2 and 5. But we know E is at 5, but we don\'t know about position 2. Also, E is not in the absent list? But we haven\'t tested E elsewhere. However, in ""crane"", we only had E at 5, and the other positions were absent, but that doesn\'t mean E can\'t be elsewhere. Similarly in ""house"" and ""utile"", we had E only at 5. So it\'s possible to have another E.\n\nBut ""BEVUE"" uses E at position 2, which we are not sure about.\n\nSimilarly, ""DEUCE"": D-E-U-C-E, but C is absent.\n\n""JUDGE"": J-U-D-G-E? Positions: J(1), U(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). But here U is at position 2, not 4. We are looking for U at position 4.\n\nFor position 4: \n- ""BUDGE"": B-U-D-G-E? U at position 2? Not 4.\n- ""FUDGE"" has U at 2.\n- ""GAUZE"": G-A-U-Z-E, A absent.\n- ""PLUME"": P-L-U-M-E, but L absent? L is absent from ""utile"" feedback (L(x)).\n\nAnother: ""QUEUE"": Q-U-E-U-E? But U at 2 and 4? And E at 3 and 5. But Q is available, but let\'s see: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). This has U at 2 and 4, and E at 3 and 5. But we know E is at 5, but we don\'t know about position 3. Also, E at 3 might be possible? But we haven\'t tested. However, the word has multiple U and E.\n\nBut it uses Q and U, E.\n\nBut we are trying to test U at position 4, so ""QUEUE"" has U at 4, but also at 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""VOGUE"": V-O-G-U-E, O absent.\n\n""VENUE"": V-E-N-U-E, N absent.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find a word with U only at position 4.\n\nPerhaps ""BEMUD"": not ending with E.\n\nAnother: ""EXUDE"": E-X-U-D-E? But E at position 1 and 5? And X, U, D. But E at position 1? We don\'t know. Also, ""exude"" is E-X-U-D-E, so positions: E(1), X(2), U(3), D(4), E(5). But U is at position 3? But we know U is not at position 3 from ""house"" feedback (U at position 3 was marked as \'-\', meaning not there). So we cannot put U at position 3. Therefore, ""exude"" is invalid because U is at 3.\n\nSimilarly, any word with U at 3 is invalid.\n\nSo for U at position 4, we need a word where U is at 4 and not at 2? Or it can be at 2 as well? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo keep it simple, we can choose ""FUDGE"" for the U at position 2 case.\n\nBut in ""FUDGE"", U is at position 2, which is a possibility.\n\nWe also have the option of U at position 4, but we couldn\'t find a common word without using absent letters.\n\nAnother word for U at position 4: ""PIQUE"" is invalid because of I.\n\n""TOQUE"" has O.\n\n""DUOMO"" not ending with E.\n\nPerhaps ""BEVUE"" or ""ENSUE"" but S absent.\n\nI think ""FUDGE"" is a good candidate: it uses new letters F, D, G, and has U at position 2.\n\nWe can also consider other words with U at position 2.\n\nFor example, ""MUDGE"": M-U-D-G-E -> similar to FUDGE but with M.\n\nOr ""PUDGE"": P-U-D-G-E.\n\nBut ""FUDGE"" is a common word.\n\nWe could also test for U at position 4 with a word like ""QUEUE"", but it has multiple U and E, which might be less likely.\n\nBut let\'s stick with ""FUDGE"" for now.\n\nHowever, we must consider that in ""FUDGE"", we are putting U at position 2. If U is actually at position 4, then in the feedback, U will show as absent? No, because U is in the word, so if we put it at position 2 and it\'s actually at 4, we will get a \'-\' for U (present but wrong position). Similarly, if it is at position 2, we get a \'✓\'.\n\nSo by guessing ""FUDGE"", we can determine the position of U.\n\nMoreover, we test F, D, G.\n\nTherefore, I think ""FUDGE"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut note: we have not tested B, M, P, W, Y, etc., but we can test them in future guesses.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""FUDGE"".Based on the feedback:\n- U must be at position 2 or 4 (since it\'s not at 1, 3, or 5).\n- The word ends with E (position 5).\n- Absent letters: A, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T.\n- Present letters: U and E.\n\n""FUDGE"" is a valid 5-letter word that:\n- Ends with E (position 5).\n- Places U at position 2 (testing that possibility).\n- Uses new, untested letters (F, D, G) to gain more information.\n- Avoids all absent letters.\n\n<guess>fudge</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**\n   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is correct and in position 5 (E(✓)). C, R, A, N are absent (x).\n   - **Guess 2 (house)**: E is correct in position 5 (E(✓)). U is present but not in position 3 (U(-)). H, O, S are absent (x).\n   - **Guess 3 (utile)**: E is correct in position 5 (E(✓)). U is present but not in position 1 (U(-)). T, I, L are absent (x).\n\n2. **Key Insights:**\n   - **Position 5 is E**: The secret word ends with E.\n   - **U is present but position unknown**: U cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (based on feedback). Therefore, U must be in position 2 or 4.\n   - **Absent letters (10 total)**: A, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T (eliminated from all guesses).\n   - **Present letters**: Only U and E are confirmed so far (E is fixed at position 5).\n   - **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (14 letters remain).\n\n3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**\n   - **Prioritize testing U\'s position**: Since U must be in position 2 or 4, the guess should place U in one of these spots to narrow it down.\n   - **Maximize new information**: Use untested common consonants (e.g., D, F, G, M, P) to cover more ground.\n   - **Avoid absent letters**: Ensure no eliminated letters (A, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T) are used.\n   - **Word structure**: The word must end with E (position 5).\n\n4. **Candidate Words:**\n   - **U in position 2 (pattern: _ U _ _ E)**: \n     - ""FUDGE"" (F, U, D, G, E) fits perfectly: Tests U at position 2 and introduces new common letters F, D, G.\n     - Alternatives like ""MUDGE"" or ""PUDGE"" were considered, but ""FUDGE"" is a common word with high-frequency letters.\n   - **U in position 4 (pattern: _ _ _ U E)**:\n     - Fewer options exist (e.g., ""QUEUE"" or ""BEVUE""), but these use rare letters (Q) or repeat E, reducing information gain. ""FUDGE"" is stronger for this guess.\n\n5. **Why ""FUDGE""?**\n   - Tests U at position 2: If U is correct here, we get a ✓; if not (and U is at position 4), we get a (-), resolving U\'s position.\n   - Introduces three new letters (F, D, G), which are common consonants.\n   - Avoids all absent letters and reuses E (correctly placed) and U (known present).\n   - If ""FUDGE"" is incorrect, feedback on F, D, and G will significantly narrow possibilities for future guesses.\n\n<guess>fudge</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: house -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) U(-) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: utile -> FEEDBACK: U(-) T(x) I(x) L(x) E(✓)\nGuess 4: fudge -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(✓) D(✓) G(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   - E is correct and in position 5 (E(✓))
   - C, R, A, N are absent (x)

2. ""house"":
   - E is correct in position 5 (E(✓))
   - U is present but not in position 3 (U(-))
   - H, O, S are absent (x)

3. ""utile"":
   - E is correct in position 5 (E(✓))
   - U is present but not in position 1 (U(-))
   - T, I, L are absent (x)

4. ""fudge"":
   - U is correct in position 2 (U(✓))
   - D is correct in position 3 (D(✓))
   - G is correct in position 4 (G(✓))
   - E is correct in position 5 (E(✓))
   - F is absent (x)

So now we know:
- The word has the following correct letters in positions:
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: D
  Position 4: G
  Position 5: E
- Therefore, the word is: _ U D G E

We only need to find the first letter.

Also, we know the following letters are absent: 
A, C, F, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T (from the x's in all guesses: C,R,A,N from guess1; H,O,S from guess2; T,I,L from guess3; F from guess4)

We also know that U, D, G, E are present and in their correct positions.

The first letter must be a letter that is not in the absent list and forms a valid English word.

The absent letters are: A, C, F, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T.

Remaining possible letters: B, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ U D G E.

Possible words:
- BUDGE: B U D G E -> but B is in the possible list? Yes, B is not absent. And ""budge"" is a word (to move slightly).
- JUDGE: J U D G E -> J is possible. ""judge"" is a word.
- MUDGE: M U D G E -> M is possible. ""mudge"" is not a common word? I think it's not standard. Let me check: I don't think ""mudge"" is a valid English word. So probably not.
- PUDGE: P U D G E -> P is possible. ""pudge"" is a word (meaning a fat person or something soft and rounded).
- VUDGE: Not a word.
- WUDGE: Not a word.
- XUDGE: Not a word.
- YUDGE: Not a word.
- ZUDGE: Not a word.

Also, Q: QUDGE? Not a word.

K: KUDGE? Not a word.

So the only common words are ""budge"", ""judge"", and ""pudge"".

But we have to see which one is the secret word.

We have not tested B, J, P in previous guesses, so we don't have direct feedback on them.

But we can guess one of them.

Since we have three possibilities, we can choose one arbitrarily, but we have to make a guess.

Note: We have only one guess left? Actually, we have 6 tries, and we are at guess 5, so we have two guesses left? But we might solve it in this guess.

But let's see: we have to pick one.

We can consider letter frequency or common words.

- ""judge"" is a very common word.
- ""budge"" is less common but still used.
- ""pudge"" is less common than ""judge"".

Therefore, ""judge"" might be a good guess.

But we must be cautious: we don't know if the word is common or not, but statistically, ""judge"" is more frequent.

Also, in the context, we have no information about J, but it's possible.

Similarly, B and P are possible.

But let's see if we can eliminate any.

We have no feedback that directly eliminates B, J, or P.

So we have to guess one.

I think ""judge"" is a reasonable choice.

But note: in ""fudge"", we had F absent, but that doesn't affect these.

So I'll go with ""judge"".

But let's confirm the pattern: J U D G E -> positions: 1:J, 2:U(✓), 3:D(✓), 4:G(✓), 5:E(✓). So if J is correct, we get all green.

Similarly for the others.

So we guess ""judge"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, the secret word has been partially revealed:

- **Position 2**: U is correct (✓).
- **Position 3**: D is correct (✓).
- **Position 4**: G is correct (✓).
- **Position 5**: E is correct (✓).

This means the word follows the pattern: `_ U D G E`.

The first letter (position 1) must be a letter that:
- Is **not** in the absent list: A, C, F, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T (from all feedback).
- Forms a valid English word when combined with ""UDGE"".

Possible candidates for the first letter include B, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (since these are untested and not eliminated). Common valid words are:
- **BUDGE**: ""Budge"" is a word (meaning to move slightly), but B is untested.
- **JUDGE**: ""Judge"" is a common word, and J is untested.
- **PUDGE**: ""Pudge"" is a word (informal for excess fat), but less common.

Given that ""judge"" is the most frequent and likely word in this pattern, and we have no prior feedback on J, it is the optimal guess to maximize the chance of solving the puzzle.

<guess>judge</guess>",judge,"We have feedback from four guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   - E is correct and in position 5 (E(✓))
   - C, R, A, N are absent (x)

2. ""house"":
   - E is correct in position 5 (E(✓))
   - U is present but not in position 3 (U(-))
   - H, O, S are absent (x)

3. ""utile"":
   - E is correct in position 5 (E(✓))
   - U is present but not in position 1 (U(-))
   - T, I, L are absent (x)

4. ""fudge"":
   - U is correct in position 2 (U(✓))
   - D is correct in position 3 (D(✓))
   - G is correct in position 4 (G(✓))
   - E is correct in position 5 (E(✓))
   - F is absent (x)

So now we know:
- The word has the following correct letters in positions:
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: D
  Position 4: G
  Position 5: E
- Therefore, the word is: _ U D G E

We only need to find the first letter.

Also, we know the following letters are absent: 
A, C, F, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T (from the x's in all guesses: C,R,A,N from guess1; H,O,S from guess2; T,I,L from guess3; F from guess4)

We also know that U, D, G, E are present and in their correct positions.

The first letter must be a letter that is not in the absent list and forms a valid English word.

The absent letters are: A, C, F, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T.

Remaining possible letters: B, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ U D G E.

Possible words:
- BUDGE: B U D G E -> but B is in the possible list? Yes, B is not absent. And ""budge"" is a word (to move slightly).
- JUDGE: J U D G E -> J is possible. ""judge"" is a word.
- MUDGE: M U D G E -> M is possible. ""mudge"" is not a common word? I think it's not standard. Let me check: I don't think ""mudge"" is a valid English word. So probably not.
- PUDGE: P U D G E -> P is possible. ""pudge"" is a word (meaning a fat person or something soft and rounded).
- VUDGE: Not a word.
- WUDGE: Not a word.
- XUDGE: Not a word.
- YUDGE: Not a word.
- ZUDGE: Not a word.

Also, Q: QUDGE? Not a word.

K: KUDGE? Not a word.

So the only common words are ""budge"", ""judge"", and ""pudge"".

But we have to see which one is the secret word.

We have not tested B, J, P in previous guesses, so we don't have direct feedback on them.

But we can guess one of them.

Since we have three possibilities, we can choose one arbitrarily, but we have to make a guess.

Note: We have only one guess left? Actually, we have 6 tries, and we are at guess 5, so we have two guesses left? But we might solve it in this guess.

But let's see: we have to pick one.

We can consider letter frequency or common words.

- ""judge"" is a very common word.
- ""budge"" is less common but still used.
- ""pudge"" is less common than ""judge"".

Therefore, ""judge"" might be a good guess.

But we must be cautious: we don't know if the word is common or not, but statistically, ""judge"" is more frequent.

Also, in the context, we have no information about J, but it's possible.

Similarly, B and P are possible.

But let's see if we can eliminate any.

We have no feedback that directly eliminates B, J, or P.

So we have to guess one.

I think ""judge"" is a reasonable choice.

But note: in ""fudge"", we had F absent, but that doesn't affect these.

So I'll go with ""judge"".

But let's confirm the pattern: J U D G E -> positions: 1:J, 2:U(✓), 3:D(✓), 4:G(✓), 5:E(✓). So if J is correct, we get all green.

Similarly for the others.

So we guess ""judge"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, the secret word has been partially revealed:

- **Position 2**: U is correct (✓).
- **Position 3**: D is correct (✓).
- **Position 4**: G is correct (✓).
- **Position 5**: E is correct (✓).

This means the word follows the pattern: `_ U D G E`.

The first letter (position 1) must be a letter that:
- Is **not** in the absent list: A, C, F, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T (from all feedback).
- Forms a valid English word when combined with ""UDGE"".

Possible candidates for the first letter include B, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (since these are untested and not eliminated). Common valid words are:
- **BUDGE**: ""Budge"" is a word (meaning to move slightly), but B is untested.
- **JUDGE**: ""Judge"" is a common word, and J is untested.
- **PUDGE**: ""Pudge"" is a word (informal for excess fat), but less common.

Given that ""judge"" is the most frequent and likely word in this pattern, and we have no prior feedback on J, it is the optimal guess to maximize the chance of solving the puzzle.",Guess 5: judge -> FEEDBACK: J(✓) U(✓) D(✓) G(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
