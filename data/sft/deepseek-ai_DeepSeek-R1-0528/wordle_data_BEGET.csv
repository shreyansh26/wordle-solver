We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, the secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N. But it does contain an E, but not in the last position.

 Since the word has 5 letters and E is in the word but not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We know the word has an E and does not have C, R, A, N.

 We need to make a second guess that uses E (but not in the last position) and avoids C, R, A, N.

 Also, we should try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters in 5-letter words (besides E) are: S, T, B, L, O, U, etc.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Has an E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5, because that was the position in ""crane"" and it was wrong)
 - Does not use C, R, A, N.

 Possible positions for E: we can try to put E in a different position. Since in ""crane"" it was at position 5 and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also want to cover other common letters.

 Let me consider words starting with E? But note: we don't know if E is at the start. We can try.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with E in the second position? Or third?

 Since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it's not at the end, let's try to put it in the middle to cover more ground.

 Example words without C, R, A, N:

 Let's try to use E in the second position: 
   _ E _ _ _

 We can try: ""BELIE"" but that has 6 letters? No, we need 5.

 How about ""BELOW""? But we don't know if the word has B, L, O, W. Also, we are avoiding A, R, C, N.

 Another idea: ""QUEST"" - but Q is not very common and we have U and E? But let's see.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPEED"" but that has two E's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one E (and it was present) but if the word had two E's, we would have seen two minuses? Actually, no: the feedback only marks the E that is present. If there are two E's and we only have one in the guess, we only get one minus. But if we have two E's in the guess and the word has two, then we would get two minuses? Actually, the game would mark each E appropriately.

 However, we don't know if the word has more than one E. So we can try a word with one E for now.

 Let me think of words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5.

 Some options:

 - E in position 1: ""E"", then we need four more letters without C, R, A, N. Example: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T, and I) -> E(x) in crane was not at position 5, but it could be at position 1? We don't know. But we can try.

 However, note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

 Another idea: use a word that has E and also includes other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: B, D, G, H, I, L, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 Let me choose a word that has E and as many of these as possible.

 One common starting word is ""SPINE"", but we have to avoid N (which we know is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

 Similarly, ""SLATE"" has A and E, but A is not in the word (from feedback) so we avoid A.

 How about ""STOLE""? 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end? But we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means E is in the word but not at position 5. So in ""STOLE"", E is at position 5 again? That would be the same as ""crane"" and we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, we need a word that has E in positions 1-4.

 Let me try to put E in position 4? For example: ""PLUME"" -> but E is at the end? No, position 4 would be the fourth letter? Actually, in a 5-letter word, positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

 We want to avoid position 5 for E.

 So let's try a word with E in position 4: 
   _ _ _ E _

 Example: ""TIMES"" -> T, I, M, E, S -> but we don't know if these letters are in the word.

 But note: we also want to test other common letters.

 Alternatively, we can try E in position 2: 
   _ E _ _ _

 Example: ""BESET"" -> but that has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

 Another: ""DELVE"" -> but E is at the end? No, in ""DELVE"": 
   D (1), E (2), L (3), V (4), E (5) -> so we have E at position 2 and 5. We want to avoid position 5? But we can use it because we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 5. Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, we know it will be marked as absent (if the word doesn't have two E's) or present but wrong position if it does have an E at position 5? But we know the word has at least one E, and it's not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5, it will be either:
   - If the word has only one E and it's not at 5, then we get an 'x' for that E at 5.
   - If the word has two E's, then we might get a '-' for that E at 5? But the word might have an E at 5 and another E elsewhere? We don't know.

 However, to avoid confusion, it's better to put E in a position we haven't tried (positions 1,2,3,4) and avoid position 5.

 So let's avoid having E at the end in this guess.

 I think ""TIMES"" is okay? But E is at position 4? 
   T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5) -> so E is at position 4, and S is at the end.

 But we don't know if E is at position 4. We are trying to test position 4.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with E at position 1: ""EDGES"" -> but that has two E's? And we are using E at position 1 and 5? We want to avoid position 5 for E? Actually, we can use it, but we know the E at position 5 will not be the same as the one we already know? Because the word has at least one E that is not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5, we might get a minus if there is a second E? But we don't know.

 To keep it simple, let's avoid using E at position 5 and use only one E in the guess.

 How about ""TOWEL""? 
   T (1), O (2), W (3), E (4), L (5) -> E is at position 4, and we avoid position 5 for E.

 Also, we are testing T, O, W, E, L.

 But note: we are not using S, which is a very common letter.

 Alternatively, ""PESTO"" -> but that has E at position 2? 
   P (1), E (2), S (3), T (4), O (5) -> E at position 2, and we avoid E at the end.

 This word uses P, E, S, T, O. That covers many common letters.

 We haven't used P, S, T, O and we know E is in the word.

 So I think ""PESTO"" is a good candidate.

 But let me check: we are avoiding C, R, A, N (which we know are not in the word). ""PESTO"" does not contain any of these.

 So let's go with ""PESTO"".

 We are hoping to get information about P, E, S, T, O and also the position of E.

 If the E in ""PESTO"" is in the correct position (position 2), then we get a check. Otherwise, we get a minus and we know it's not at position 2.

 Also, we get feedback for the other letters.

 Therefore, I choose ""PESTO"" as the second guess.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Include E in a position other than the 5th (to test new locations).
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to maximize information.

A strong second guess is **""PESTO""**:
- P, E, S, T, O are all untested letters.
- E is placed in position 2 (new location to check).
- Tests high-frequency consonants (S, T) and vowels (O).

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPEED"" but that has two E's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one E (and it was present) but if the word had two E's, we would have seen two minuses? Actually, no: the feedback only marks the E that is present. If there are two E's and we only have one in the guess, we only get one minus. But if we have two E's in the guess and the word has two, then we would get two minuses? Actually, the game would mark each E appropriately.

 However, we don't know if the word has more than one E. So we can try a word with one E for now.

 Let me think of words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5.

 Some options:

 - E in position 1: ""E"", then we need four more letters without C, R, A, N. Example: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T, and I) -> E(x) in crane was not at position 5, but it could be at position 1? We don't know. But we can try.

 However, note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

 Another idea: use a word that has E and also includes other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: B, D, G, H, I, L, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 Let me choose a word that has E and as many of these as possible.

 One common starting word is ""SPINE"", but we have to avoid N (which we know is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

 Similarly, ""SLATE"" has A and E, but A is not in the word (from feedback) so we avoid A.

 How about ""STOLE""? 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end? But we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means E is in the word but not at position 5. So in ""STOLE"", E is at position 5 again? That would be the same as ""crane"" and we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, we need a word that has E in positions 1-4.

 Let me try to put E in position 4? For example: ""PLUME"" -> but E is at the end? No, position 4 would be the fourth letter? Actually, in a 5-letter word, positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

 We want to avoid position 5 for E.

 So let's try a word with E in position 4: 
   _ _ _ E _

 Example: ""TIMES"" -> T, I, M, E, S -> but we don't know if these letters are in the word.

 But note: we also want to test other common letters.

 Alternatively, we can try E in position 2: 
   _ E _ _ _

 Example: ""BESET"" -> but that has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

 Another: ""DELVE"" -> but E is at the end? No, in ""DELVE"": 
   D (1), E (2), L (3), V (4), E (5) -> so we have E at position 2 and 5. We want to avoid position 5? But we can use it because we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 5. Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, we know it will be marked as absent (if the word doesn't have two E's) or present but wrong position if it does have an E at position 5? But we know the word has at least one E, and it's not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5, it will be either:
   - If the word has only one E and it's not at 5, then we get an 'x' for that E at 5.
   - If the word has two E's, then we might get a '-' for that E at 5? But the word might have an E at 5 and another E elsewhere? We don't know.

 However, to avoid confusion, it's better to put E in a position we haven't tried (positions 1,2,3,4) and avoid position 5.

 So let's avoid having E at the end in this guess.

 I think ""TIMES"" is okay? But E is at position 4? 
   T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5) -> so E is at position 4, and S is at the end.

 But we don't know if E is at position 4. We are trying to test position 4.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with E at position 1: ""EDGES"" -> but that has two E's? And we are using E at position 1 and 5? We want to avoid position 5 for E? Actually, we can use it, but we know the E at position 5 will not be the same as the one we already know? Because the word has at least one E that is not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5, we might get a minus if there is a second E? But we don't know.

 To keep it simple, let's avoid using E at position 5 and use only one E in the guess.

 How about ""TOWEL""? 
   T (1), O (2), W (3), E (4), L (5) -> E is at position 4, and we avoid position 5 for E.

 Also, we are testing T, O, W, E, L.

 But note: we are not using S, which is a very common letter.

 Alternatively, ""PESTO"" -> but that has E at position 2? 
   P (1), E (2), S (3), T (4), O (5) -> E at position 2, and we avoid E at the end.

 This word uses P, E, S, T, O. That covers many common letters.

 We haven't used P, S, T, O and we know E is in the word.

 So I think ""PESTO"" is a good candidate.

 But let me check: we are avoiding C, R, A, N (which we know are not in the word). ""PESTO"" does not contain any of these.

 So let's go with ""PESTO"".

 We are hoping to get information about P, E, S, T, O and also the position of E.

 If the E in ""PESTO"" is in the correct position (position 2), then we get a check. Otherwise, we get a minus and we know it's not at position 2.

 Also, we get feedback for the other letters.

 Therefore, I choose ""PESTO"" as the second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Include E in a position other than the 5th (to test new locations).
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to maximize information.

A strong second guess is **""PESTO""**:
- P, E, S, T, O are all untested letters.
- E is placed in position 2 (new location to check).
- Tests high-frequency consonants (S, T) and vowels (O).

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
  C, R, A, N are not in the word.
  E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""pesto"" -> P(x) E(✓) S(x) T(-) O(x)
Meaning:
  P, S, O are not in the word.
  E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, because in ""pesto"", E is the second letter).
  T is in the word but not in position 4 (since in ""pesto"", T is the fourth letter).

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word has E in the second position.
- The secret word has T, but not in position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, S, O.

We also know from the first guess that E is in the word (and now we know it's at position 2) and that T is present but not in position 4.

Now, we know the second letter is E.

So the secret word pattern is: _ E _ _ _

We also know the word contains T, but not at position 4.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, S, T, O. So we should avoid these except E and T (which are in the word).

But note: E and T are the only ones from the guessed letters that are in the word.

Now, we need to think of a word that:
- Has the second letter E.
- Contains T (but not at position 4).
- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, S, O.

We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test other common letters.

Common letters we haven't used: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.

We also need to consider the position of T. Since it cannot be at position 4, it can be at positions 1, 3, or 5.

We can try to put T in position 1 or 3 or 5 to test.

But note: we already know T is not at position 4, so we can try position 1 or 3 or 5.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let me try to form a word that fits the pattern _ E _ _ _ and includes T and other new letters.

Possible positions for T:
- Position 1: T E _ _ _
- Position 3: _ E T _ _
- Position 5: _ E _ _ T

We also need to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let's think of words that start with T and have E in the second position: TE???

For example: 
  ""TEETH"" -> but has E at the end? And we have two E's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid S, O, etc. But ""TEETH"" has T, E, E, T, H -> but we don't know if H is allowed. Also, we have two T's? Actually, the word has two T's and two E's.

But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. So we can try, but it might be better to avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.

Alternatively, ""TELLY"" is not a word? Or ""TEPID"" -> but P is forbidden (from guess2: P is not in the word). ""TEPID"" has P? No, T, E, P, I, D -> P is forbidden, so we cannot use P.

We cannot use P because it was marked 'x' in guess2.

Similarly, we cannot use S, O, etc.

So for T at position 1: we need a word starting with TE, then three letters that are not C,R,A,N,P,S,O.

Available letters: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.

Example: ""TELLY"" (if valid) or ""TEDDY"" (duplicate D? and Y) or ""TENDU"" (but N is forbidden) -> N is forbidden.

We cannot use N.

So: ""TEETH"" uses E and T and H. But we have two E's and two T's? Actually, ""TEETH"" has T at position 1, E at 2, E at 3, T at 4, H at 5. But we know T cannot be at position 4? Because in guess2, T was at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the T in the secret word is not at position 4. So if we put T at position 4 in a new guess, it would be wrong? But we are allowed to put it, but we know it's not the correct position. However, if the word has two T's, then we might get a minus for that position? But we don't know.

But to avoid confusion, let's not put T at position 4 because we know it's not the correct spot for the T that is in the word. However, if there is a second T, then it could be at position 4? But we don't know.

Given the constraints, it might be better to avoid using T at position 4 in this guess because we are not sure about duplicates.

So let's try to put T at position 1 or 3 or 5.

Similarly, we can try T at position 3: _ E T _ _

Example: ""BETTY"" -> B, E, T, T, Y -> duplicate T? And we don't know if allowed. Also, we are testing B and Y.

But we can try to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Another: ""DELTA"" -> but D, E, L, T, A -> A is forbidden.

We cannot use A.

""METAL"" -> M, E, T, A, L -> A is forbidden.

""FETID"" -> F, E, T, I, D -> F is not forbidden? We haven't used F. And no forbidden letters.

But is ""FETID"" a word? Yes, meaning foul or putrid.

So ""FETID"": 
  F at position 1, E at 2 (which we know is correct), T at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

But we know T is in the word, and we are putting it at position 3. Also, we are testing F, I, D.

But note: we also know that T is not at position 4 (from the feedback of ""pesto""). But we are putting T at position 3, which is allowed.

So this seems a good candidate.

But let's check the letters: F, E, T, I, D. None of these are forbidden (forbidden: C,R,A,N,P,S,O). So we can use them.

Alternatively, we can try T at position 5: _ E _ _ T

Example: ""HEIST"" -> H, E, I, S, T -> but S is forbidden (from guess2: S is not in the word). So we cannot use S.

""DEBUT"" -> D, E, B, U, T -> no forbidden letters? D, E, B, U, T. Forbidden are C,R,A,N,P,S,O. So B, U, D, T are allowed.

But we are putting T at position 5, and we know E is at position 2.

So ""DEBUT"": D at 1, E at 2, B at 3, U at 4, T at 5.

This tests D, B, U, and T (at position 5).

But we also know T is in the word, and if we put it at position 5, we might get feedback on whether it's at the end.

But we have two options: ""FETID"" and ""DEBUT"". Which one to choose?

We can also consider ""BEGET"" -> B, E, G, E, T -> duplicate E? And T at the end. But we are testing B, G, and T. But we have two E's? And we know E is at position 2, so the E at position 4 would be an extra.

But we don't know if the word has two E's.

To maximize information, it's better to use all distinct letters if possible.

So ""FETID"" has distinct letters: F, E, T, I, D.

""DEBUT"" has distinct letters: D, E, B, U, T.

Both are good.

But note: we also want to test the position of T. In ""FETID"", T is at position 3, and in ""DEBUT"", T is at position 5.

We know T is not at position 4, but we don't know about position 3 or 5.

Since we have limited guesses, we can choose one that tests more common letters.

Common letters: E, T, D, L, H, I, etc.

""FETID"" tests F, I, D.
""DEBUT"" tests D, B, U.

F is less common than B? Let me think about frequency.

In English, B is more common than F? Actually, according to letter frequency, E is the most common, then T, then A (but A is out), then O (out), then I, N (out), S (out), H, R (out), D, L, U, ... 

So H, D, L, U are relatively common.

But we haven't tested H, L, U, D, B, etc.

In ""FETID"", we test F (less common), I, D.
In ""DEBUT"", we test D, B, U.

I is a vowel and common, so ""FETID"" tests I and D, which are common.

But ""DEBUT"" tests B and U, which are also common.

Alternatively, we can try a word that includes H or L.

For example, with T at position 1: ""TEETH"" is not good because of duplicates and forbidden letters? Actually, ""TEETH"" has no forbidden letters? T, E, E, T, H. Forbidden are C,R,A,N,P,S,O. So H is allowed. But duplicates.

But let's avoid duplicates.

Another word: ""TELES"" -> but S is forbidden.

""TELLY"" might not be standard.

""HELLO"" -> but E is at position 2? H, E, L, L, O -> but O is forbidden and duplicate L.

Not good.

""HEFTY"" -> H, E, F, T, Y -> T is at position 4? But we know T is not at position 4? Because in ""pesto"", T was at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word does not have T at position 4. Therefore, we should not put T at position 4 in our guess? Actually, we can, but we know it's not the correct position. However, if the word has two T's, then we might get a minus for T at position 4? But we don't know.

But to avoid wasting a position, it's better to put T in a position we haven't tried: positions 1, 3, or 5.

In ""HEFTY"", if we put T at position 4, we know it's wrong, so we get a minus, which doesn't give new information about the position. So it's better to avoid.

Therefore, let's choose between ""FETID"" and ""DEBUT"".

I think ""FETID"" is a good choice because it tests I (vowel) and D, and F (which might be less common, but we need to test).

But let me see if there is a word that includes more common letters.

What about ""MEDIA"" -> but A is forbidden.

""BELIE"" -> but 6 letters? No, 5: B, E, L, I, E -> duplicate E? And we are testing B, L, I. But we have E at position 2 and 5? We know E is at position 2, so position 5 might be a duplicate? But we don't know. Also, we avoid duplicate if possible.

But ""BELIE"" is a word.

But we are avoiding duplicates? Not necessarily, but for testing, distinct letters are better.

Another: ""BEVEL"" -> B, E, V, E, L -> duplicate E.

Not ideal.

""JETTY"" -> J, E, T, T, Y -> duplicate T and J is not very common.

I think ""FETID"" is acceptable.

But let's check the dictionary: ""FETID"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""DEBUT"" is valid.

But in ""DEBUT"", we are putting T at position 5. If the secret word has T at position 5, then we get a check. Otherwise, we get a minus and know it's not at 5.

In ""FETID"", we put T at position 3.

We don't know which position is more likely.

But we can also consider the frequency of T in positions.

In 5-letter words, T is common at the end (position 5) and at the beginning (position 1) and in the middle.

But without more information, we can choose arbitrarily.

I think I'll go with ""FETID"" because it tests the vowel I and the consonant D, and F is a less common letter so if it's in the word we get information, if not we eliminate it.

So let's choose ""FETID"".

But note: in ""FETID"", we have:
  Position 1: F
  Position 2: E (correct, so we expect a check)
  Position 3: T
  Position 4: I
  Position 5: D

We know the second letter is E, so it will be correct.

We are testing F, T at 3, I, D.

If T is at position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's at 1 or 5.

Similarly for the others.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, the third guess is ""FETID"".
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- **E** is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from ""pesto"").
- **T** is in the word but not in position 4 (- from ""pesto"").
- The word does **not** contain C, R, A, N, P, S, or O (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).

The secret word pattern is: _ E _ _ _

For the next guess:
- Must include **T** (in a position other than 4, so positions 1, 3, or 5).
- Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, P, S, O).
- Test new common letters (e.g., D, F, I, L, M) to maximize information.

A strong third guess is **""FETID""**:
- Places **E** correctly in position 2.
- Tests **T** in position 3 (a new position to check).
- Introduces new common letters: **F** (position 1), **I** (position 4), and **D** (position 5).
- All letters are distinct and valid.

<guess>fetid</guess>",fetid,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
  C, R, A, N are not in the word.
  E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""pesto"" -> P(x) E(✓) S(x) T(-) O(x)
Meaning:
  P, S, O are not in the word.
  E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, because in ""pesto"", E is the second letter).
  T is in the word but not in position 4 (since in ""pesto"", T is the fourth letter).

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word has E in the second position.
- The secret word has T, but not in position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, S, O.

We also know from the first guess that E is in the word (and now we know it's at position 2) and that T is present but not in position 4.

Now, we know the second letter is E.

So the secret word pattern is: _ E _ _ _

We also know the word contains T, but not at position 4.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, S, T, O. So we should avoid these except E and T (which are in the word).

But note: E and T are the only ones from the guessed letters that are in the word.

Now, we need to think of a word that:
- Has the second letter E.
- Contains T (but not at position 4).
- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, S, O.

We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test other common letters.

Common letters we haven't used: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.

We also need to consider the position of T. Since it cannot be at position 4, it can be at positions 1, 3, or 5.

We can try to put T in position 1 or 3 or 5 to test.

But note: we already know T is not at position 4, so we can try position 1 or 3 or 5.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let me try to form a word that fits the pattern _ E _ _ _ and includes T and other new letters.

Possible positions for T:
- Position 1: T E _ _ _
- Position 3: _ E T _ _
- Position 5: _ E _ _ T

We also need to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let's think of words that start with T and have E in the second position: TE???

For example: 
  ""TEETH"" -> but has E at the end? And we have two E's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid S, O, etc. But ""TEETH"" has T, E, E, T, H -> but we don't know if H is allowed. Also, we have two T's? Actually, the word has two T's and two E's.

But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. So we can try, but it might be better to avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.

Alternatively, ""TELLY"" is not a word? Or ""TEPID"" -> but P is forbidden (from guess2: P is not in the word). ""TEPID"" has P? No, T, E, P, I, D -> P is forbidden, so we cannot use P.

We cannot use P because it was marked 'x' in guess2.

Similarly, we cannot use S, O, etc.

So for T at position 1: we need a word starting with TE, then three letters that are not C,R,A,N,P,S,O.

Available letters: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.

Example: ""TELLY"" (if valid) or ""TEDDY"" (duplicate D? and Y) or ""TENDU"" (but N is forbidden) -> N is forbidden.

We cannot use N.

So: ""TEETH"" uses E and T and H. But we have two E's and two T's? Actually, ""TEETH"" has T at position 1, E at 2, E at 3, T at 4, H at 5. But we know T cannot be at position 4? Because in guess2, T was at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the T in the secret word is not at position 4. So if we put T at position 4 in a new guess, it would be wrong? But we are allowed to put it, but we know it's not the correct position. However, if the word has two T's, then we might get a minus for that position? But we don't know.

But to avoid confusion, let's not put T at position 4 because we know it's not the correct spot for the T that is in the word. However, if there is a second T, then it could be at position 4? But we don't know.

Given the constraints, it might be better to avoid using T at position 4 in this guess because we are not sure about duplicates.

So let's try to put T at position 1 or 3 or 5.

Similarly, we can try T at position 3: _ E T _ _

Example: ""BETTY"" -> B, E, T, T, Y -> duplicate T? And we don't know if allowed. Also, we are testing B and Y.

But we can try to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Another: ""DELTA"" -> but D, E, L, T, A -> A is forbidden.

We cannot use A.

""METAL"" -> M, E, T, A, L -> A is forbidden.

""FETID"" -> F, E, T, I, D -> F is not forbidden? We haven't used F. And no forbidden letters.

But is ""FETID"" a word? Yes, meaning foul or putrid.

So ""FETID"": 
  F at position 1, E at 2 (which we know is correct), T at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

But we know T is in the word, and we are putting it at position 3. Also, we are testing F, I, D.

But note: we also know that T is not at position 4 (from the feedback of ""pesto""). But we are putting T at position 3, which is allowed.

So this seems a good candidate.

But let's check the letters: F, E, T, I, D. None of these are forbidden (forbidden: C,R,A,N,P,S,O). So we can use them.

Alternatively, we can try T at position 5: _ E _ _ T

Example: ""HEIST"" -> H, E, I, S, T -> but S is forbidden (from guess2: S is not in the word). So we cannot use S.

""DEBUT"" -> D, E, B, U, T -> no forbidden letters? D, E, B, U, T. Forbidden are C,R,A,N,P,S,O. So B, U, D, T are allowed.

But we are putting T at position 5, and we know E is at position 2.

So ""DEBUT"": D at 1, E at 2, B at 3, U at 4, T at 5.

This tests D, B, U, and T (at position 5).

But we also know T is in the word, and if we put it at position 5, we might get feedback on whether it's at the end.

But we have two options: ""FETID"" and ""DEBUT"". Which one to choose?

We can also consider ""BEGET"" -> B, E, G, E, T -> duplicate E? And T at the end. But we are testing B, G, and T. But we have two E's? And we know E is at position 2, so the E at position 4 would be an extra.

But we don't know if the word has two E's.

To maximize information, it's better to use all distinct letters if possible.

So ""FETID"" has distinct letters: F, E, T, I, D.

""DEBUT"" has distinct letters: D, E, B, U, T.

Both are good.

But note: we also want to test the position of T. In ""FETID"", T is at position 3, and in ""DEBUT"", T is at position 5.

We know T is not at position 4, but we don't know about position 3 or 5.

Since we have limited guesses, we can choose one that tests more common letters.

Common letters: E, T, D, L, H, I, etc.

""FETID"" tests F, I, D.
""DEBUT"" tests D, B, U.

F is less common than B? Let me think about frequency.

In English, B is more common than F? Actually, according to letter frequency, E is the most common, then T, then A (but A is out), then O (out), then I, N (out), S (out), H, R (out), D, L, U, ... 

So H, D, L, U are relatively common.

But we haven't tested H, L, U, D, B, etc.

In ""FETID"", we test F (less common), I, D.
In ""DEBUT"", we test D, B, U.

I is a vowel and common, so ""FETID"" tests I and D, which are common.

But ""DEBUT"" tests B and U, which are also common.

Alternatively, we can try a word that includes H or L.

For example, with T at position 1: ""TEETH"" is not good because of duplicates and forbidden letters? Actually, ""TEETH"" has no forbidden letters? T, E, E, T, H. Forbidden are C,R,A,N,P,S,O. So H is allowed. But duplicates.

But let's avoid duplicates.

Another word: ""TELES"" -> but S is forbidden.

""TELLY"" might not be standard.

""HELLO"" -> but E is at position 2? H, E, L, L, O -> but O is forbidden and duplicate L.

Not good.

""HEFTY"" -> H, E, F, T, Y -> T is at position 4? But we know T is not at position 4? Because in ""pesto"", T was at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word does not have T at position 4. Therefore, we should not put T at position 4 in our guess? Actually, we can, but we know it's not the correct position. However, if the word has two T's, then we might get a minus for T at position 4? But we don't know.

But to avoid wasting a position, it's better to put T in a position we haven't tried: positions 1, 3, or 5.

In ""HEFTY"", if we put T at position 4, we know it's wrong, so we get a minus, which doesn't give new information about the position. So it's better to avoid.

Therefore, let's choose between ""FETID"" and ""DEBUT"".

I think ""FETID"" is a good choice because it tests I (vowel) and D, and F (which might be less common, but we need to test).

But let me see if there is a word that includes more common letters.

What about ""MEDIA"" -> but A is forbidden.

""BELIE"" -> but 6 letters? No, 5: B, E, L, I, E -> duplicate E? And we are testing B, L, I. But we have E at position 2 and 5? We know E is at position 2, so position 5 might be a duplicate? But we don't know. Also, we avoid duplicate if possible.

But ""BELIE"" is a word.

But we are avoiding duplicates? Not necessarily, but for testing, distinct letters are better.

Another: ""BEVEL"" -> B, E, V, E, L -> duplicate E.

Not ideal.

""JETTY"" -> J, E, T, T, Y -> duplicate T and J is not very common.

I think ""FETID"" is acceptable.

But let's check the dictionary: ""FETID"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""DEBUT"" is valid.

But in ""DEBUT"", we are putting T at position 5. If the secret word has T at position 5, then we get a check. Otherwise, we get a minus and know it's not at 5.

In ""FETID"", we put T at position 3.

We don't know which position is more likely.

But we can also consider the frequency of T in positions.

In 5-letter words, T is common at the end (position 5) and at the beginning (position 1) and in the middle.

But without more information, we can choose arbitrarily.

I think I'll go with ""FETID"" because it tests the vowel I and the consonant D, and F is a less common letter so if it's in the word we get information, if not we eliminate it.

So let's choose ""FETID"".

But note: in ""FETID"", we have:
  Position 1: F
  Position 2: E (correct, so we expect a check)
  Position 3: T
  Position 4: I
  Position 5: D

We know the second letter is E, so it will be correct.

We are testing F, T at 3, I, D.

If T is at position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's at 1 or 5.

Similarly for the others.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, the third guess is ""FETID"".Based on the feedback:
- **E** is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from ""pesto"").
- **T** is in the word but not in position 4 (- from ""pesto"").
- The word does **not** contain C, R, A, N, P, S, or O (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).

The secret word pattern is: _ E _ _ _

For the next guess:
- Must include **T** (in a position other than 4, so positions 1, 3, or 5).
- Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, P, S, O).
- Test new common letters (e.g., D, F, I, L, M) to maximize information.

A strong third guess is **""FETID""**:
- Places **E** correctly in position 2.
- Tests **T** in position 3 (a new position to check).
- Introduces new common letters: **F** (position 1), **I** (position 4), and **D** (position 5).
- All letters are distinct and valid.",Guess 3: fetid -> FEEDBACK: F(x) E(✓) T(-) I(x) D(x),FAIL

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, the secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N. But it does contain an E, but not in the last position.

 Since the word has 5 letters and E is in the word but not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We know the word has an E and does not have C, R, A, N.

 We need to make a second guess that uses E (but not in the last position) and avoids C, R, A, N.

 Also, we should try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters in 5-letter words (besides E) are: S, T, B, L, O, U, etc.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Has an E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5, because that was the position in ""crane"" and it was wrong)
 - Does not use C, R, A, N.

 Possible positions for E: we can try to put E in a different position. Since in ""crane"" it was at position 5 and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also want to cover other common letters.

 Let me consider words starting with E? But note: we don't know if E is at the start. We can try.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with E in the second position? Or third?

 Since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it's not at the end, let's try to put it in the middle to cover more ground.

 Example words without C, R, A, N:

 Let's try to use E in the second position: 
   _ E _ _ _

 We can try: ""BELIE"" but that has 6 letters? No, we need 5.

 How about ""BELOW""? But we don't know if the word has B, L, O, W. Also, we are avoiding A, R, C, N.

 Another idea: ""QUEST"" - but Q is not very common and we have U and E? But let's see.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPEED"" but that has two E's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one E (and it was present) but if the word had two E's, we would have seen two minuses? Actually, no: the feedback only marks the E that is present. If there are two E's and we only have one in the guess, we only get one minus. But if we have two E's in the guess and the word has two, then we would get two minuses? Actually, the game would mark each E appropriately.

 However, we don't know if the word has more than one E. So we can try a word with one E for now.

 Let me think of words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5.

 Some options:

 - E in position 1: ""E"", then we need four more letters without C, R, A, N. Example: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T, and I) -> E(x) in crane was not at position 5, but it could be at position 1? We don't know. But we can try.

 However, note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

 Another idea: use a word that has E and also includes other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: B, D, G, H, I, L, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 Let me choose a word that has E and as many of these as possible.

 One common starting word is ""SPINE"", but we have to avoid N (which we know is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

 Similarly, ""SLATE"" has A and E, but A is not in the word (from feedback) so we avoid A.

 How about ""STOLE""? 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end? But we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means E is in the word but not at position 5. So in ""STOLE"", E is at position 5 again? That would be the same as ""crane"" and we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, we need a word that has E in positions 1-4.

 Let me try to put E in position 4? For example: ""PLUME"" -> but E is at the end? No, position 4 would be the fourth letter? Actually, in a 5-letter word, positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

 We want to avoid position 5 for E.

 So let's try a word with E in position 4: 
   _ _ _ E _

 Example: ""TIMES"" -> T, I, M, E, S -> but we don't know if these letters are in the word.

 But note: we also want to test other common letters.

 Alternatively, we can try E in position 2: 
   _ E _ _ _

 Example: ""BESET"" -> but that has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

 Another: ""DELVE"" -> but E is at the end? No, in ""DELVE"": 
   D (1), E (2), L (3), V (4), E (5) -> so we have E at position 2 and 5. We want to avoid position 5? But we can use it because we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 5. Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, we know it will be marked as absent (if the word doesn't have two E's) or present but wrong position if it does have an E at position 5? But we know the word has at least one E, and it's not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5, it will be either:
   - If the word has only one E and it's not at 5, then we get an 'x' for that E at 5.
   - If the word has two E's, then we might get a '-' for that E at 5? But the word might have an E at 5 and another E elsewhere? We don't know.

 However, to avoid confusion, it's better to put E in a position we haven't tried (positions 1,2,3,4) and avoid position 5.

 So let's avoid having E at the end in this guess.

 I think ""TIMES"" is okay? But E is at position 4? 
   T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5) -> so E is at position 4, and S is at the end.

 But we don't know if E is at position 4. We are trying to test position 4.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with E at position 1: ""EDGES"" -> but that has two E's? And we are using E at position 1 and 5? We want to avoid position 5 for E? Actually, we can use it, but we know the E at position 5 will not be the same as the one we already know? Because the word has at least one E that is not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5, we might get a minus if there is a second E? But we don't know.

 To keep it simple, let's avoid using E at position 5 and use only one E in the guess.

 How about ""TOWEL""? 
   T (1), O (2), W (3), E (4), L (5) -> E is at position 4, and we avoid position 5 for E.

 Also, we are testing T, O, W, E, L.

 But note: we are not using S, which is a very common letter.

 Alternatively, ""PESTO"" -> but that has E at position 2? 
   P (1), E (2), S (3), T (4), O (5) -> E at position 2, and we avoid E at the end.

 This word uses P, E, S, T, O. That covers many common letters.

 We haven't used P, S, T, O and we know E is in the word.

 So I think ""PESTO"" is a good candidate.

 But let me check: we are avoiding C, R, A, N (which we know are not in the word). ""PESTO"" does not contain any of these.

 So let's go with ""PESTO"".

 We are hoping to get information about P, E, S, T, O and also the position of E.

 If the E in ""PESTO"" is in the correct position (position 2), then we get a check. Otherwise, we get a minus and we know it's not at position 2.

 Also, we get feedback for the other letters.

 Therefore, I choose ""PESTO"" as the second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Include E in a position other than the 5th (to test new locations).
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to maximize information.

A strong second guess is **""PESTO""**:
- P, E, S, T, O are all untested letters.
- E is placed in position 2 (new location to check).
- Tests high-frequency consonants (S, T) and vowels (O).

<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
  C, R, A, N are not in the word.
  E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""pesto"" -> P(x) E(✓) S(x) T(-) O(x)
Meaning:
  P, S, O are not in the word.
  E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, because in ""pesto"", E is the second letter).
  T is in the word but not in position 4 (since in ""pesto"", T is the fourth letter).

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word has E in the second position.
- The secret word has T, but not in position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, S, O.

We also know from the first guess that E is in the word (and now we know it's at position 2) and that T is present but not in position 4.

Now, we know the second letter is E.

So the secret word pattern is: _ E _ _ _

We also know the word contains T, but not at position 4.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, S, T, O. So we should avoid these except E and T (which are in the word).

But note: E and T are the only ones from the guessed letters that are in the word.

Now, we need to think of a word that:
- Has the second letter E.
- Contains T (but not at position 4).
- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, S, O.

We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test other common letters.

Common letters we haven't used: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.

We also need to consider the position of T. Since it cannot be at position 4, it can be at positions 1, 3, or 5.

We can try to put T in position 1 or 3 or 5 to test.

But note: we already know T is not at position 4, so we can try position 1 or 3 or 5.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let me try to form a word that fits the pattern _ E _ _ _ and includes T and other new letters.

Possible positions for T:
- Position 1: T E _ _ _
- Position 3: _ E T _ _
- Position 5: _ E _ _ T

We also need to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let's think of words that start with T and have E in the second position: TE???

For example: 
  ""TEETH"" -> but has E at the end? And we have two E's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid S, O, etc. But ""TEETH"" has T, E, E, T, H -> but we don't know if H is allowed. Also, we have two T's? Actually, the word has two T's and two E's.

But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. So we can try, but it might be better to avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.

Alternatively, ""TELLY"" is not a word? Or ""TEPID"" -> but P is forbidden (from guess2: P is not in the word). ""TEPID"" has P? No, T, E, P, I, D -> P is forbidden, so we cannot use P.

We cannot use P because it was marked 'x' in guess2.

Similarly, we cannot use S, O, etc.

So for T at position 1: we need a word starting with TE, then three letters that are not C,R,A,N,P,S,O.

Available letters: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.

Example: ""TELLY"" (if valid) or ""TEDDY"" (duplicate D? and Y) or ""TENDU"" (but N is forbidden) -> N is forbidden.

We cannot use N.

So: ""TEETH"" uses E and T and H. But we have two E's and two T's? Actually, ""TEETH"" has T at position 1, E at 2, E at 3, T at 4, H at 5. But we know T cannot be at position 4? Because in guess2, T was at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the T in the secret word is not at position 4. So if we put T at position 4 in a new guess, it would be wrong? But we are allowed to put it, but we know it's not the correct position. However, if the word has two T's, then we might get a minus for that position? But we don't know.

But to avoid confusion, let's not put T at position 4 because we know it's not the correct spot for the T that is in the word. However, if there is a second T, then it could be at position 4? But we don't know.

Given the constraints, it might be better to avoid using T at position 4 in this guess because we are not sure about duplicates.

So let's try to put T at position 1 or 3 or 5.

Similarly, we can try T at position 3: _ E T _ _

Example: ""BETTY"" -> B, E, T, T, Y -> duplicate T? And we don't know if allowed. Also, we are testing B and Y.

But we can try to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Another: ""DELTA"" -> but D, E, L, T, A -> A is forbidden.

We cannot use A.

""METAL"" -> M, E, T, A, L -> A is forbidden.

""FETID"" -> F, E, T, I, D -> F is not forbidden? We haven't used F. And no forbidden letters.

But is ""FETID"" a word? Yes, meaning foul or putrid.

So ""FETID"": 
  F at position 1, E at 2 (which we know is correct), T at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

But we know T is in the word, and we are putting it at position 3. Also, we are testing F, I, D.

But note: we also know that T is not at position 4 (from the feedback of ""pesto""). But we are putting T at position 3, which is allowed.

So this seems a good candidate.

But let's check the letters: F, E, T, I, D. None of these are forbidden (forbidden: C,R,A,N,P,S,O). So we can use them.

Alternatively, we can try T at position 5: _ E _ _ T

Example: ""HEIST"" -> H, E, I, S, T -> but S is forbidden (from guess2: S is not in the word). So we cannot use S.

""DEBUT"" -> D, E, B, U, T -> no forbidden letters? D, E, B, U, T. Forbidden are C,R,A,N,P,S,O. So B, U, D, T are allowed.

But we are putting T at position 5, and we know E is at position 2.

So ""DEBUT"": D at 1, E at 2, B at 3, U at 4, T at 5.

This tests D, B, U, and T (at position 5).

But we also know T is in the word, and if we put it at position 5, we might get feedback on whether it's at the end.

But we have two options: ""FETID"" and ""DEBUT"". Which one to choose?

We can also consider ""BEGET"" -> B, E, G, E, T -> duplicate E? And T at the end. But we are testing B, G, and T. But we have two E's? And we know E is at position 2, so the E at position 4 would be an extra.

But we don't know if the word has two E's.

To maximize information, it's better to use all distinct letters if possible.

So ""FETID"" has distinct letters: F, E, T, I, D.

""DEBUT"" has distinct letters: D, E, B, U, T.

Both are good.

But note: we also want to test the position of T. In ""FETID"", T is at position 3, and in ""DEBUT"", T is at position 5.

We know T is not at position 4, but we don't know about position 3 or 5.

Since we have limited guesses, we can choose one that tests more common letters.

Common letters: E, T, D, L, H, I, etc.

""FETID"" tests F, I, D.
""DEBUT"" tests D, B, U.

F is less common than B? Let me think about frequency.

In English, B is more common than F? Actually, according to letter frequency, E is the most common, then T, then A (but A is out), then O (out), then I, N (out), S (out), H, R (out), D, L, U, ... 

So H, D, L, U are relatively common.

But we haven't tested H, L, U, D, B, etc.

In ""FETID"", we test F (less common), I, D.
In ""DEBUT"", we test D, B, U.

I is a vowel and common, so ""FETID"" tests I and D, which are common.

But ""DEBUT"" tests B and U, which are also common.

Alternatively, we can try a word that includes H or L.

For example, with T at position 1: ""TEETH"" is not good because of duplicates and forbidden letters? Actually, ""TEETH"" has no forbidden letters? T, E, E, T, H. Forbidden are C,R,A,N,P,S,O. So H is allowed. But duplicates.

But let's avoid duplicates.

Another word: ""TELES"" -> but S is forbidden.

""TELLY"" might not be standard.

""HELLO"" -> but E is at position 2? H, E, L, L, O -> but O is forbidden and duplicate L.

Not good.

""HEFTY"" -> H, E, F, T, Y -> T is at position 4? But we know T is not at position 4? Because in ""pesto"", T was at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word does not have T at position 4. Therefore, we should not put T at position 4 in our guess? Actually, we can, but we know it's not the correct position. However, if the word has two T's, then we might get a minus for T at position 4? But we don't know.

But to avoid wasting a position, it's better to put T in a position we haven't tried: positions 1, 3, or 5.

In ""HEFTY"", if we put T at position 4, we know it's wrong, so we get a minus, which doesn't give new information about the position. So it's better to avoid.

Therefore, let's choose between ""FETID"" and ""DEBUT"".

I think ""FETID"" is a good choice because it tests I (vowel) and D, and F (which might be less common, but we need to test).

But let me see if there is a word that includes more common letters.

What about ""MEDIA"" -> but A is forbidden.

""BELIE"" -> but 6 letters? No, 5: B, E, L, I, E -> duplicate E? And we are testing B, L, I. But we have E at position 2 and 5? We know E is at position 2, so position 5 might be a duplicate? But we don't know. Also, we avoid duplicate if possible.

But ""BELIE"" is a word.

But we are avoiding duplicates? Not necessarily, but for testing, distinct letters are better.

Another: ""BEVEL"" -> B, E, V, E, L -> duplicate E.

Not ideal.

""JETTY"" -> J, E, T, T, Y -> duplicate T and J is not very common.

I think ""FETID"" is acceptable.

But let's check the dictionary: ""FETID"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""DEBUT"" is valid.

But in ""DEBUT"", we are putting T at position 5. If the secret word has T at position 5, then we get a check. Otherwise, we get a minus and know it's not at 5.

In ""FETID"", we put T at position 3.

We don't know which position is more likely.

But we can also consider the frequency of T in positions.

In 5-letter words, T is common at the end (position 5) and at the beginning (position 1) and in the middle.

But without more information, we can choose arbitrarily.

I think I'll go with ""FETID"" because it tests the vowel I and the consonant D, and F is a less common letter so if it's in the word we get information, if not we eliminate it.

So let's choose ""FETID"".

But note: in ""FETID"", we have:
  Position 1: F
  Position 2: E (correct, so we expect a check)
  Position 3: T
  Position 4: I
  Position 5: D

We know the second letter is E, so it will be correct.

We are testing F, T at 3, I, D.

If T is at position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's at 1 or 5.

Similarly for the others.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, the third guess is ""FETID"".Based on the feedback:
- **E** is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from ""pesto"").
- **T** is in the word but not in position 4 (- from ""pesto"").
- The word does **not** contain C, R, A, N, P, S, or O (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).

The secret word pattern is: _ E _ _ _

For the next guess:
- Must include **T** (in a position other than 4, so positions 1, 3, or 5).
- Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, P, S, O).
- Test new common letters (e.g., D, F, I, L, M) to maximize information.

A strong third guess is **""FETID""**:
- Places **E** correctly in position 2.
- Tests **T** in position 3 (a new position to check).
- Introduces new common letters: **F** (position 1), **I** (position 4), and **D** (position 5).
- All letters are distinct and valid.

Since in ""crane"" it was at position 5 and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n We also want to cover other common letters.\n\n Let me consider words starting with E? But note: we don\'t know if E is at the start. We can try.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word with E in the second position? Or third?\n\n Since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it\'s not at the end, let\'s try to put it in the middle to cover more ground.\n\n Example words without C, R, A, N:\n\n Let\'s try to use E in the second position: \n   _ E _ _ _\n\n We can try: ""BELIE"" but that has 6 letters?

We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters.\n\n But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one E (and it was present) but if the word had two E\'s, we would have seen two minuses? Actually, no: the feedback only marks the E that is present. If there are two E\'s and we only have one in the guess, we only get one minus. But if we have two E\'s in the guess and the word has two, then we would get two minuses? Actually, the game would mark each E appropriately.\n\n However, we don\'t know if the word has more than one E. So we can try a word with one E for now.\n\n Let me think of words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5.\n\n Some options:\n\n - E in position 1: ""E"", then we need four more letters without C, R, A, N. Example: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T, and I) -> E(x) in crane was not at position 5, but it could be at position 1? We don\'t know. But we can try.\n\n However, note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.\n\n Another idea: use a word that has E and also includes other common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tried.\n\n We haven\'t used: B, D, G, H, I, L, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.\n\n Let me choose a word that has E and as many of these as possible.\n\n One common starting word is ""SPINE"", but we have to avoid N (which we know is not in the word). So we cannot use N.\n\n Similarly, ""SLATE"" has A and E, but A is not in the word (from feedback) so we avoid A.\n\n How about ""STOLE""? \n   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end? But we know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means E is in the word but not at position 5. So in ""STOLE"", E is at position 5 again? That would be the same as ""crane"" and we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.\n\n Therefore, we need a word that has E in positions 1-4.\n\n Let me try to put E in position 4? For example: ""PLUME"" -> but E is at the end? No, position 4 would be the fourth letter? Actually, in a 5-letter word, positions are 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n We want to avoid position 5 for E.\n\n So let\'s try a word with E in position 4: \n   _ _ _ E _\n\n Example: ""TIMES"" -> T, I, M, E, S -> but we don\'t know if these letters are in the word.\n\n But note: we also want to test other common letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try E in position 2: \n   _ E _ _ _\n\n Example: ""BESET"" -> but that has two E\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed.\n\n Another: ""DELVE"" -> but E is at the end? No, in ""DELVE"": \n   D (1), E (2), L (3), V (4), E (5) -> so we have E at position 2 and 5. We want to avoid position 5? But we can use it because we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s at position 5. Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, we know it will be marked as absent (if the word doesn\'t have two E\'s) or present but wrong position if it does have an E at position 5? But we know the word has at least one E, and it\'s not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5, it will be either:\n   - If the word has only one E and it\'s not at 5, then we get an \'x\' for that E at 5.\n   - If the word has two E\'s, then we might get a \'-\' for that E at 5? But the word might have an E at 5 and another E elsewhere? We don\'t know.\n\n However, to avoid confusion, it\'s better to put E in a position we haven\'t tried (positions 1,2,3,4) and avoid position 5.\n\n So let\'s avoid having E at the end in this guess.\n\n I think ""TIMES"" is okay? But E is at position 4? \n   T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5) -> so E is at position 4, and S is at the end.\n\n But we don\'t know if E is at position 4. We are trying to test position 4.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word with E at position 1: ""EDGES"" -> but that has two E\'s? And we are using E at position 1 and 5? We want to avoid position 5 for E? Actually, we can use it, but we know the E at position 5 will not be the same as the one we already know? Because the word has at least one E that is not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5, we might get a minus if there is a second E? But we don\'t know.\n\n To keep it simple, let\'s avoid using E at position 5 and use only one E in the guess.\n\n How about ""TOWEL""? \n   T (1), O (2), W (3), E (4), L (5) -> E is at position 4, and we avoid position 5 for E.\n\n Also, we are testing T, O, W, E, L.\n\n But note: we are not using S, which is a very common letter.\n\n Alternatively, ""PESTO"" -> but that has E at position 2? \n   P (1), E (2), S (3), T (4), O (5) -> E at position 2, and we avoid E at the end.\n\n This word uses P, E, S, T, O. That covers many common letters.\n\n We haven\'t used P, S, T, O and we know E is in the word.\n\n So I think ""PESTO"" is a good candidate.\n\n But let me check: we are avoiding C, R, A, N (which we know are not in the word). ""PESTO"" does not contain any of these.\n\n So let\'s go with ""PESTO"".\n\n We are hoping to get information about P, E, S, T, O and also the position of E.\n\n If the E in ""PESTO"" is in the correct position (position 2), then we get a check. Otherwise, we get a minus and we know it\'s not at position 2.\n\n Also, we get feedback for the other letters.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""PESTO"" as the second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- E is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.\n- Include E in a position other than the 5th (to test new locations).\n- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to maximize information.\n\nA strong second guess is **""PESTO""**:\n- P, E, S, T, O are all untested letters.\n- E is placed in position 2 (new location to check).\n- Tests high-frequency consonants (S, T) and vowels (O).\n\n<guess>pesto</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: pesto -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) S(x) T(-) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n  C, R, A, N are not in the word.\n  E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""pesto"" -> P(x) E(✓) S(x) T(-) O(x)\nMeaning:\n  P, S, O are not in the word.\n  E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, because in ""pesto"", E is the second letter).\n  T is in the word but not in position 4 (since in ""pesto"", T is the fourth letter).\n\nSo, from the feedback:\n- The secret word has E in the second position.\n- The secret word has T, but not in position 4.\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, S, O.\n\nWe also know from the first guess that E is in the word (and now we know it\'s at position 2) and that T is present but not in position 4.\n\nNow, we know the second letter is E.\n\nSo the secret word pattern is: _ E _ _ _\n\nWe also know the word contains T, but not at position 4.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, S, T, O.

Actually, the word has two T\'s and two E\'s.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters. So we can try, but it might be better to avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.\n\nAlternatively, ""TELLY"" is not a word? Or ""TEPID"" -> but P is forbidden (from guess2: P is not in the word). ""TEPID"" has P? No, T, E, P, I, D -> P is forbidden, so we cannot use P.\n\nWe cannot use P because it was marked \'x\' in guess2.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use S, O, etc.\n\nSo for T at position 1: we need a word starting with TE, then three letters that are not C,R,A,N,P,S,O.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.\n\nExample: ""TELLY"" (if valid) or ""TEDDY"" (duplicate D? and Y) or ""TENDU"" (but N is forbidden) -> N is forbidden.\n\nWe cannot use N.\n\nSo: ""TEETH"" uses E and T and H. But we have two E\'s and two T\'s? Actually, ""TEETH"" has T at position 1, E at 2, E at 3, T at 4, H at 5. But we know T cannot be at position 4? Because in guess2, T was at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the T in the secret word is not at position 4. So if we put T at position 4 in a new guess, it would be wrong? But we are allowed to put it, but we know it\'s not the correct position. However, if the word has two T\'s, then we might get a minus for that position? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, let\'s not put T at position 4 because we know it\'s not the correct spot for the T that is in the word.

And we don\'t know if allowed. Also, we are testing B and Y.\n\nBut we can try to avoid duplicates to test more letters.\n\nAnother: ""DELTA"" -> but D, E, L, T, A -> A is forbidden.\n\nWe cannot use A.\n\n""METAL"" -> M, E, T, A, L -> A is forbidden.\n\n""FETID"" -> F, E, T, I, D -> F is not forbidden? We haven\'t used F. And no forbidden letters.\n\nBut is ""FETID"" a word? Yes, meaning foul or putrid.\n\nSo ""FETID"": \n  F at position 1, E at 2 (which we know is correct), T at 3, I at 4, D at 5.\n\nBut we know T is in the word, and we are putting it at position 3. Also, we are testing F, I, D.\n\nBut note: we also know that T is not at position 4 (from the feedback of ""pesto""). But we are putting T at position 3, which is allowed.\n\nSo this seems a good candidate.\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: F, E, T, I, D. None of these are forbidden (forbidden: C,R,A,N,P,S,O). So we can use them.\n\nAlternatively, we can try T at position 5: _ E _ _ T\n\nExample: ""HEIST"" -> H, E, I, S, T -> but S is forbidden (from guess2: S is not in the word). So we cannot use S.\n\n""DEBUT"" -> D, E, B, U, T -> no forbidden letters? D, E, B, U, T. Forbidden are C,R,A,N,P,S,O. So B, U, D, T are allowed.\n\nBut we are putting T at position 5, and we know E is at position 2.\n\nSo ""DEBUT"": D at 1, E at 2, B at 3, U at 4, T at 5.\n\nThis tests D, B, U, and T (at position 5).\n\nBut we also know T is in the word, and if we put it at position 5, we might get feedback on whether it\'s at the end.\n\nBut we have two options: ""FETID"" and ""DEBUT"". Which one to choose?\n\nWe can also consider ""BEGET"" -> B, E, G, E, T -> duplicate E? And T at the end. But we are testing B, G, and T. But we have two E\'s? And we know E is at position 2, so the E at position 4 would be an extra.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\nTo maximize information, it\'s better to use all distinct letters if possible.\n\nSo ""FETID"" has distinct letters: F, E, T, I, D.\n\n""DEBUT"" has distinct letters: D, E, B, U, T.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nBut note: we also want to test the position of T. In ""FETID"", T is at position 3, and in ""DEBUT"", T is at position 5.\n\nWe know T is not at position 4, but we don\'t know about position 3 or 5.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we can choose one that tests more common letters.\n\nCommon letters: E, T, D, L, H, I, etc.\n\n""FETID"" tests F, I, D.\n""DEBUT"" tests D, B, U.\n\nF is less common than B? Let me think about frequency.\n\nIn English, B is more common than F? Actually, according to letter frequency, E is the most common, then T, then A (but A is out), then O (out), then I, N (out), S (out), H, R (out), D, L, U, ... \n\nSo H, D, L, U are relatively common.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested H, L, U, D, B, etc.\n\nIn ""FETID"", we test F (less common), I, D.\nIn ""DEBUT"", we test D, B, U.\n\nI is a vowel and common, so ""FETID"" tests I and D, which are common.\n\nBut ""DEBUT"" tests B and U, which are also common.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that includes H or L.\n\nFor example, with T at position 1: ""TEETH"" is not good because of duplicates and forbidden letters? Actually, ""TEETH"" has no forbidden letters? T, E, E, T, H. Forbidden are C,R,A,N,P,S,O. So H is allowed. But duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates.\n\nAnother word: ""TELES"" -> but S is forbidden.\n\n""TELLY"" might not be standard.\n\n""HELLO"" -> but E is at position 2? H, E, L, L, O -> but O is forbidden and duplicate L.\n\nNot good.\n\n""HEFTY"" -> H, E, F, T, Y -> T is at position 4? But we know T is not at position 4? Because in ""pesto"", T was at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word does not have T at position 4. Therefore, we should not put T at position 4 in our guess? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not the correct position. However, if the word has two T\'s, then we might get a minus for T at position 4? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut to avoid wasting a position, it\'s better to put T in a position we haven\'t tried: positions 1, 3, or 5.\n\nIn ""HEFTY"", if we put T at position 4, we know it\'s wrong, so we get a minus, which doesn\'t give new information about the position. So it\'s better to avoid.\n\nTherefore, let\'s choose between ""FETID"" and ""DEBUT"".\n\nI think ""FETID"" is a good choice because it tests I (vowel) and D, and F (which might be less common, but we need to test).\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that includes more common letters.\n\nWhat about ""MEDIA"" -> but A is forbidden.\n\n""BELIE"" -> but 6 letters? No, 5: B, E, L, I, E -> duplicate E? And we are testing B, L, I. But we have E at position 2 and 5? We know E is at position 2, so position 5 might be a duplicate? But we don\'t know. Also, we avoid duplicate if possible.\n\nBut ""BELIE"" is a word.\n\nBut we are avoiding duplicates? Not necessarily, but for testing, distinct letters are better.\n\nAnother: ""BEVEL"" -> B, E, V, E, L -> duplicate E.\n\nNot ideal.\n\n""JETTY"" -> J, E, T, T, Y -> duplicate T and J is not very common.\n\nI think ""FETID"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s check the dictionary: ""FETID"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""DEBUT"" is valid.\n\nBut in ""DEBUT"", we are putting T at position 5. If the secret word has T at position 5, then we get a check. Otherwise, we get a minus and know it\'s not at 5.\n\nIn ""FETID"", we put T at position 3.\n\nWe don\'t know which position is more likely.\n\nBut we can also consider the frequency of T in positions.\n\nIn 5-letter words, T is common at the end (position 5) and at the beginning (position 1) and in the middle.\n\nBut without more information, we can choose arbitrarily.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""FETID"" because it tests the vowel I and the consonant D, and F is a less common letter so if it\'s in the word we get information, if not we eliminate it.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""FETID"".\n\nBut note: in ""FETID"", we have:\n  Position 1: F\n  Position 2: E (correct, so we expect a check)\n  Position 3: T\n  Position 4: I\n  Position 5: D\n\nWe know the second letter is E, so it will be correct.\n\nWe are testing F, T at 3, I, D.\n\nIf T is at position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it\'s at 1 or 5.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nSo I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""FETID"".Based on the feedback:\n- **E** is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from ""pesto"").\n- **T** is in the word but not in position 4 (- from ""pesto"").\n- The word does **not** contain C, R, A, N, P, S, or O (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).\n\nThe secret word pattern is: _ E _ _ _\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **T** (in a position other than 4, so positions 1, 3, or 5).\n- Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, P, S, O).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., D, F, I, L, M) to maximize information.\n\nA strong third guess is **""FETID""**:\n- Places **E** correctly in position 2.\n- Tests **T** in position 3 (a new position to check).\n- Introduces new common letters: **F** (position 1), **I** (position 4), and **D** (position 5).\n- All letters are distinct and valid.\n\n<guess>fetid</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: pesto -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) S(x) T(-) O(x)\nGuess 3: fetid -> FEEDBACK: F(x) E(✓) T(-) I(x) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess ""fetid"":
 F(x) E(✓) T(-) I(x) D(x)

This means:
- F is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, as before) (✓)
- T is in the word but not in position 3 (because we placed T at position 3 and got a minus) (-)
- I is not in the word (x)
- D is not in the word (x)

So, updating our knowledge:
- The secret word has E in position 2: _ E _ _ _
- The secret word has T, but not in position 3 or 4 (from guess2: T not in position 4, and now not in position 3).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, S, O, F, I, D.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, S, T, O, F, I, D.

The only letters we know are in the word: E (position 2) and T (somewhere, but not position 3 or 4).

Since T cannot be at position 3 or 4, and the word is 5 letters, T must be at position 1 or 5.

So the word is either:
  T E _ _ _ 
or 
  _ E _ _ T

We also know that the word does not contain the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, P, S, O, F, I, D.

We need to find a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only the remaining letters.

Remaining common letters: B, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, and possibly others.

We have 3 guesses left (since we've used 3 and we get 6 total).

We can try to guess a word that fits one of the patterns and tests several new letters.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: T at position 1 -> T E _ _ _

We need to fill the last three positions with letters not forbidden and not used (or used but not in the word, but we know which are not in the word).

We have to avoid: C,R,A,N,P,S,O,F,I,D.

So available: B, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with TE, then three letters from the available set.

Examples: 
  ""TELLY"" (if valid) -> T, E, L, L, Y -> but duplicate L? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed.
  ""TEETH"" -> T, E, E, T, H -> duplicates and we know T is at position 1, but if the word has another T? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have E at position 2 and 3? But we know E is only at position 2? Not necessarily, there could be another E.

But we don't have information about duplicates.

To avoid risk, we might prefer words without duplicates to test more letters.

Another: ""TEMPT"" -> but P is forbidden and M is available? T, E, M, P, T -> P is forbidden.

""TEPID"" -> P is forbidden.

""TEACH"" -> A and C forbidden.

""TEASE"" -> S and E duplicate, S forbidden.

""TELLY"" might not be standard. ""TENCH"" -> N forbidden.

""TEGU"" is 4 letters.

""TELEX"" -> L, E, X -> but E is at position 2, then L at 3, E at 4? Duplicate E? And X is not forbidden? We haven't used X. But ""TELEX"" is a word? T, E, L, E, X -> positions: 1:T, 2:E, 3:L, 4:E, 5:X. But we have E at position 4? And we know E is at position 2, but if the word has two E's, it's possible. But we are testing.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: no C,R,A,N,P,S,O,F,I,D. So X is allowed.

But let's see if there are better words.

Another: ""TECHY"" -> C forbidden.

""TEDDY"" -> D forbidden.

""TEMPO"" -> P and O forbidden.

""TERRY"" -> R forbidden.

""TESTY"" -> S forbidden.

""TEWEL"" -> T, E, W, E, L -> duplicate E? And W and L are allowed.

But we have E at position 2 and 4? And we know E is at position 2, so position 4 would be an extra.

But we don't know.

Alternatively, case 2: T at position 5 -> _ E _ _ T

Pattern: ? E ? ? T

Available letters: B, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.

Examples: 
  ""HEIST"" -> but S and I forbidden? I is forbidden, S is forbidden.
  ""BEAUT"" -> A and U? A forbidden, and U is allowed? B, E, A, U, T -> A forbidden.
  ""DEBUT"" -> D forbidden.
  ""JEWET"" -> not common? J, E, W, E, T -> duplicate E? J is allowed? But not common.
  ""MEETT"" -> not a word.
  ""LEVET"" -> not common? L, E, V, E, T -> duplicate E, V is allowed.
  ""NEWT"" is 4 letters.

""BEVY"" is 4.

""HEART"" -> H, E, A, R, T -> A and R forbidden.

""WEIGHT"" -> 6 letters.

""YELPT"" -> Y, E, L, P, T -> P forbidden.

""KELLT"" -> not a word.

""MELLT"" -> not.

""WELLT"" -> not.

""HELMT"" -> not standard.

""BELTT"" -> duplicate T? B, E, L, T, T -> but we are putting T at position 5, and if we put T at position 4? Then we have two T's? Pattern: position 1: B, 2: E, 3: L, 4: T, 5: T -> but we know T is not at position 4? Because in guess2, T was at position 4 and it was wrong, and in guess3, T was at position 3 and wrong. But if the word has two T's, then we might have T at position 4? But we don't know.

But we are not sure, so we can try a word that doesn't put T at position 4 to avoid confusion.

But in the pattern for case 2, we are putting T at position 5, so we don't put T at position 4.

So we need a word ending with T, with E at position 2, and the first, third, and fourth letters from the available set.

Example: ""HEART"" -> forbidden.

""LEANT"" -> A and N forbidden.

""MEANT"" -> A and N.

""BEVAT"" -> not common? B, E, V, A, T -> A forbidden.

""LEVIT"" -> not common.

""HELOT"" -> H, E, L, O, T -> O forbidden.

""HEROT"" -> not common and R forbidden.

""MERIT"" -> R and I? M, E, R, I, T -> R and I forbidden.

""WELLY"" -> W, E, L, L, Y -> but ends with Y, not T.

We need to end with T.

""JETSET"" -> too long.

Perhaps ""BEGET"" -> B, E, G, E, T -> duplicate E? And ends with T. But we have E at position 2 and 4? And we are testing B and G.

But ""BEGET"" is a word.

Similarly, ""BESET"" -> S forbidden.

""DEMIT"" -> D forbidden.

""HEXED"" -> D and X? But D forbidden, and ends with D, not T.

""KEXYT"" -> not a word.

This is difficult. Maybe we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters.

Given the constraints, let's list possible words.

We know:
- Position 2 is E.
- T is at position 1 or 5.
- Forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,P,S,O,F,I,D.

Available letters: B, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, V, X, Z, etc.

Case 1: T at 1 -> T E _ _ _

We need three letters for positions 3,4,5.

Possible words:
  ""TELLY"" - T,E,L,L,Y (if accepted, but it's informal for television)
  ""TEETH"" - T,E,E,T,H (duplicates)
  ""TECHY"" - C forbidden
  ""TEPID"" - P forbidden
  ""TEMPO"" - P,O forbidden
  ""TERRY"" - R forbidden
  ""TESTY"" - S forbidden
  ""TEWEL"" - T,E,W,E,L (duplicate E) - but ""TEWEL"" is not common, maybe ""JEWEL"" but J at start?
  ""TEUCH"" - not common.

""TELLY"" might be acceptable in some dictionaries. Or ""TELEX"" - T,E,L,E,X (duplicate E) - ""TELEX"" is a word.

""TELEX"": T (1), E (2), L (3), E (4), X (5) -> duplicate E.

But we can use it.

Case 2: T at 5 -> _ E _ _ T

Possible words:
  ""BEVET"" - not common
  ""HEVET"" - not
  ""LEVET"" - L,E,V,E,T (duplicate E) - ""LEVET"" is not common, but ""LEVET"" might be a surname?
  ""MEVET"" - not
  ""WEVET"" - not
  ""YELPT"" - P forbidden
  ""MELTY"" - M,E,L,T,Y -> but ends with Y, not T. We need T at end.

""GUEST"" -> S forbidden.

""BUILT"" -> U,I -> I forbidden.

""BELTT"" - not a word.

""BELLT"" - not.

""CELLT"" - C forbidden.

""HELLT"" - not.

""WELLT"" - not.

""BEGET"" - B,E,G,E,T -> duplicate E.

""BESET"" - S forbidden.

""BEMUD"" - D forbidden.

""BEMIX"" - B,E,M,I,X -> I forbidden.

""HEXET"" - not a word.

""KEXES"" - S forbidden.

This is challenging.

Perhaps we missed a word.

Another idea: ""THUMB"" -> but T at 1, then H,U,M,B -> but pattern is T E _ _ _, so second letter must be E, not H.

So not.

Or for case 2: ""CHEST"" -> C and S forbidden.

Let's think of common words.

Perhaps ""THEFT"" -> T,H,E,F,T -> but F is forbidden (from guess3: F not in word) and duplicate T? And pattern: if T at 1, then H at 2? But we need E at 2. So not.

Another: ""SWEET"" -> S forbidden.

""TWEET"" -> T,W,E,E,T -> duplicate T and E, and S not used? T,W,E,E,T: positions 1:T, 2:W? But we need E at position 2. So not.

We must have E at position 2.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might be ""THEME"" -> but T at 1, H at 2? No, we need E at 2.

Unless it's ""THEME"" with E at 2? T, H, E, M, E -> position 2 is H, not E.

Not.

""TEETH"" is a word: T, E, E, T, H -> position 2 is E, so it fits case 1.

And it has duplicate E and T.

Similarly, ""BELLE"" -> B,E,L,L,E -> duplicate L and E, and ends with E, not T.

But we need T in the word.

""BELLE"" has no T.

""BETTY"" -> B,E,T,T,Y -> duplicate T, and pattern: if T at 5? B,E,T,T,Y -> position 5 is Y, not T. If we want T at 5, then ""BETTY"" has T at position 3 and 4, not 5.

But we know T is not at position 3 or 4, so ""BETTY"" would not be possible.

Similarly, ""METAL"" -> A forbidden.

Perhaps ""LETHE"" -> L,E,T,H,E -> duplicate E, and ends with E, not T. But we have T at position 3, which we know is not allowed (from guess3: T not at position 3).

So not.

""LITHE"" -> I forbidden.

After reviewing, possible words might be:

For case 1: T at 1
  ""TEETH"" - T,E,E,T,H -> positions: 1:T, 2:E, 3:E, 4:T, 5:H
  But we know T is not at position 4 (from guess2: T not at position 4), so if the word has T at position 4, it would be a different T? But if there are two T's, it's possible. However, in ""TEETH"", there is a T at position 4, which we know is not the correct position for the T that is in the word? No, the feedback doesn't specify which T. It just says T is in the word but not at position 4. If the word has two T's, one at position 1 and one at position 4, then the T at position 4 is still in the word, but in the wrong position? So it would be marked as present but wrong position? But in guess2, when we put T at position 4, we got a minus, which means that particular position is wrong, but it doesn't say anything about other T's.

But in ""TEETH"", if we have T at position 1 and 4, then the T at position 4 is in the word, but not at that position? Yes, so it would be marked as present but wrong position if we guess it at position 4.

But in our case, for ""TEETH"", we are not guessing it yet, but it is a candidate.

Similarly, for case 2: T at 5
  ""BEGET"" - B,E,G,E,T -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:E, 5:T
  Here, T is at position 5, and we have E at position 2 and 4.

We know T is in the word, and not at position 3 or 4, so position 5 is possible.

Also, we have E at position 4, which might be duplicate.

Now, we have to choose a guess that can distinguish or fit.

But we have only a few letters left to use.

Perhaps we can guess ""TEETH"" to test case 1.

Or ""BEGET"" to test case 2.

But let's see what letters we can test.

We have not used: B, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, V, X, Z.

In ""TEETH"", we would test T at position 1 and 4 (but we know T at position 4 is not correct, so we expect a minus for position 4, and if the word has T at position 1, we get a check, and also test H at position 5.

In ""BEGET"", we test B at 1, G at 3, E at 4 (which might be duplicate), and T at 5.

But we know E is at position 2, so if we get a check for E at position 4, then there is a duplicate E.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't have duplicates and tests new letters.

For example, for case 1: T at 1, we can try ""TEGUS"" -> S forbidden, and not 5 letters? ""TEGU"" is 4.

""TELES"" -> S forbidden.

""TEHOU"" -> not a word.

""TEKKE"" -> duplicate E and K? T,E,K,K,E -> not common.

""TEMSE"" -> S forbidden.

""TENGE"" -> N forbidden.

""TEREK"" -> R forbidden.

""TETRA"" -> R and A forbidden.

""TEWIT"" -> T,E,W,I,T -> I forbidden and duplicate T.

""THUJA"" -> H,U,J,A -> A forbidden.

""THUMP"" -> H,U,M,P -> P forbidden.

""THYME"" -> H,Y,M,E -> duplicate E? T,H,Y,M,E -> position 2 is H, not E. Not.

For case 2: T at 5, try ""GAMUT"" -> A forbidden.

""HABUT"" -> A forbidden.

""JUMAR"" -> not.

""LEMUT"" -> not.

""MAUT"" is 4.

""REBUT"" -> R forbidden.

""UMIAC"" -> not.

""UNGET"" -> U,N,G,E,T -> N forbidden.

""USENT"" -> not.

""VOMIT"" -> O and I forbidden.

""WEMBS"" -> S forbidden.

""YENTE"" -> E at position 2? Y,E,N,T,E -> N forbidden and duplicate E.

""YETIS"" -> S and I forbidden.

""YUKTY"" -> not.

So it seems that with the letters available, the only common words might have duplicates or use forbidden letters.

Perhaps ""LIGHT"" -> but pattern: L,I,G,H,T -> I forbidden, and position 2 is I, not E.

Not.

"" might"" -> M,I,G,H,T -> I forbidden.

""BIGHT"" -> B,I,G,H,T -> I forbidden.

"" fight"" -> F forbidden.

"" wight"" -> W,I,G,H,T -> I forbidden.

""HEIGHT"" -> 6 letters.

""EIGHT"" -> E,I,G,H,T -> position 1 is E, but we need position 2 to be E, so position 1 is I? E at 1, I at 2? Not.

We need position 2 to be E.

So back to the two cases.

Perhaps ""THEFT"" is not possible because of F and position 2 not E.

Another idea: ""BERTH"" -> B,E,R,T,H -> R forbidden.

""PERth"" -> P and R forbidden.

"" earth"" -> A and R.

"" berth"" -> R.

I think we have to consider that the word might be ""TEETH"" or ""BEGET"".

Or ""MEET "" with T? ""MEETT"" not a word.

""BEVET"" not.

Let's search for words ending with T and E at position 2.

For example, ""DWELT"" -> D forbidden.

""FELT"" 4 letters.

""GELT"" -> G,E,L,T -> 4 letters.

""KELT"" -> 4.

"" belt"" -> B,E,L,T -> 4.

""CELT"" -> C.

""DELT"" -> D.

"" felt"" -> F.

"" pelt"" -> P.

"" welt"" -> W,E,L,T -> 4 letters.

5-letter words: ""BEGET"", ""BESET"" (S), ""RELET"" (R), ""DEFET"" (D), ""REFET"" (R), ""REFUT"" (R), ""REGUT"" not, ""REMIT"" (R,I), etc.

""HEIST"" (S,I).

So ""BEGET"" is a possibility.

Similarly, for T at 1, ""TEETH"" is a possibility.

We can guess ""TEETH"" to test.

If we guess ""TEETH"":

- T at position 1: if correct, we get a check, else if not in word, we get x, but we know T is in the word, so if not at 1, then it must be at 5, so we would get x for T at 1, but then we know T is at 5.

- E at position 2: check.
- E at position 3: if the word has E at position 3, we get a check or minus? If it's in the word but not at position 3, minus, or if not in the word, x, but we know E is at position 2, so if there is another E, it might be at position 3 or not.

But it's messy.

Perhaps guess a word that has T at position 5 and no duplicate letters, but we couldn't find one.

Another word: ""LEAPT"" -> A and P forbidden.

""WEARY"" -> not ending with T.

""YEUKY"" -> not.

I think we have to go with ""BEGET"" or ""TEETH"".

Let's choose ""BEGET"" because it has T at position 5, which we haven't tested yet.

So guess ""BEGET"".

But ""BEGET"" has B at 1, E at 2 (correct), G at 3, E at 4, T at 5.

We know E is at position 2, so position 4 E might be duplicate.

We are testing B, G, and T at 5.

If T is at position 5, we get a check.

If not, then T must be at position 1, and we get x for T at 5, and then we know the word must have T at 1.

Also, for position 4 E: if we get a check, then there is a duplicate E; if minus, then E is not at position 4; if x, then no duplicate E? But we know E is in the word at position 2, so if we get x for E at position 4, it means there is no second E.

Similarly for B and G.

So it can give us information.

Therefore, I'll go with ""BEGET"".Based on the feedback:
- **E** is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from previous guesses).
- **T** is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from ""pesto"" and ""fetid"" feedback).
- The word does **not** contain C, R, A, N, P, S, O, F, I, or D (all marked ""x"").

The secret word pattern is: _ E _ _ _

Since **T** must be in position 1 or 5 (the only remaining positions), we have two cases:
1. **T E _ _ _**
2. ** _ E _ _ T**

For the next guess:
- Test **T** in position 5 (to distinguish between the two cases).
- Avoid forbidden letters.
- Include new common letters (e.g., B, G) to gather more information.

A suitable guess is **""BEGET""**:
- **B** (position 1), **E** (position 2, correct), **G** (position 3), **E** (position 4), **T** (position 5).
- Tests **T** in position 5 (if correct, we get a ✓; if not, T must be in position 1).
- Tests **B** and **G** as new letters.
- Checks for a potential second **E** (position 4).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Known Information**:
   - The secret word has **E** in the second position (✓ from ""pesto"" and ""fetid"").
   - **T** is in the word but **not in position 3 or 4** (from ""pesto"" and ""fetid"" feedback).
   - The word **does not contain**: C, R, A, N, P, S, O, F, I, D (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
   - The pattern is: `_ E _ _ _`.
   - **T must be in position 1 or 5** (the only positions left since positions 3 and 4 are ruled out).

2. **Strategy for the Next Guess**:
   - **Test T in position 5**: This helps distinguish between the two possible patterns:
     - If T is correct in position 5, the pattern is `_ E _ _ T`.
     - If T is absent (x) or wrong position (-) in position 5, then T must be in position 1 (`T E _ _ _`).
   - **Avoid forbidden letters**: Do not use C, R, A, N, P, S, O, F, I, D.
   - **Test new common letters**: Prioritize high-frequency unused letters like B, G, H, L, M, U, W, Y to maximize information.
   - **Check for duplicate E**: Since E is confirmed in position 2, placing E in position 4 tests for a possible second E.

3. **Choosing the Guess: ""BEGET""**:
   - **B** (position 1): Tests a new common consonant (B is the 16th most common English letter).
   - **E** (position 2): Confirmed correct (✓), so no new info but maintains the pattern.
   - **G** (position 3): Tests a new common consonant (G is the 20th most common letter).
   - **E** (position 4): Tests for a duplicate E (if present, we get ✓ or -; if absent, we get x).
   - **T** (position 5): Directly tests the critical position for T.
   - **Why ""BEGET""?** 
     - It fits the constraints (no forbidden letters).
     - It tests two new letters (B and G) and the position of T efficiently.
     - If T is not in position 5, we immediately know it must be in position 1 for future guesses.
     - It is a valid 5-letter word.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If **T is ✓ in position 5**, the word ends with T (pattern `_ E _ _ T`), and we focus on positions 1, 3, and 4.
   - If **T is - or x in position 5**, T must be in position 1 (pattern `T E _ _ _`), and we focus on positions 3, 4, and 5.
   - Feedback on B, G, and the second E will further narrow down possibilities.

<guess>beget</guess>",beget,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""fetid"":
 F(x) E(✓) T(-) I(x) D(x)

This means:
- F is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, as before) (✓)
- T is in the word but not in position 3 (because we placed T at position 3 and got a minus) (-)
- I is not in the word (x)
- D is not in the word (x)

So, updating our knowledge:
- The secret word has E in position 2: _ E _ _ _
- The secret word has T, but not in position 3 or 4 (from guess2: T not in position 4, and now not in position 3).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, S, O, F, I, D.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, S, T, O, F, I, D.

The only letters we know are in the word: E (position 2) and T (somewhere, but not position 3 or 4).

Since T cannot be at position 3 or 4, and the word is 5 letters, T must be at position 1 or 5.

So the word is either:
  T E _ _ _ 
or 
  _ E _ _ T

We also know that the word does not contain the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, P, S, O, F, I, D.

We need to find a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only the remaining letters.

Remaining common letters: B, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, and possibly others.

We have 3 guesses left (since we've used 3 and we get 6 total).

We can try to guess a word that fits one of the patterns and tests several new letters.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: T at position 1 -> T E _ _ _

We need to fill the last three positions with letters not forbidden and not used (or used but not in the word, but we know which are not in the word).

We have to avoid: C,R,A,N,P,S,O,F,I,D.

So available: B, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with TE, then three letters from the available set.

Examples: 
  ""TELLY"" (if valid) -> T, E, L, L, Y -> but duplicate L? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed.
  ""TEETH"" -> T, E, E, T, H -> duplicates and we know T is at position 1, but if the word has another T? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have E at position 2 and 3? But we know E is only at position 2? Not necessarily, there could be another E.

But we don't have information about duplicates.

To avoid risk, we might prefer words without duplicates to test more letters.

Another: ""TEMPT"" -> but P is forbidden and M is available? T, E, M, P, T -> P is forbidden.

""TEPID"" -> P is forbidden.

""TEACH"" -> A and C forbidden.

""TEASE"" -> S and E duplicate, S forbidden.

""TELLY"" might not be standard. ""TENCH"" -> N forbidden.

""TEGU"" is 4 letters.

""TELEX"" -> L, E, X -> but E is at position 2, then L at 3, E at 4? Duplicate E? And X is not forbidden? We haven't used X. But ""TELEX"" is a word? T, E, L, E, X -> positions: 1:T, 2:E, 3:L, 4:E, 5:X. But we have E at position 4? And we know E is at position 2, but if the word has two E's, it's possible. But we are testing.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: no C,R,A,N,P,S,O,F,I,D. So X is allowed.

But let's see if there are better words.

Another: ""TECHY"" -> C forbidden.

""TEDDY"" -> D forbidden.

""TEMPO"" -> P and O forbidden.

""TERRY"" -> R forbidden.

""TESTY"" -> S forbidden.

""TEWEL"" -> T, E, W, E, L -> duplicate E? And W and L are allowed.

But we have E at position 2 and 4? And we know E is at position 2, so position 4 would be an extra.

But we don't know.

Alternatively, case 2: T at position 5 -> _ E _ _ T

Pattern: ? E ? ? T

Available letters: B, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.

Examples: 
  ""HEIST"" -> but S and I forbidden? I is forbidden, S is forbidden.
  ""BEAUT"" -> A and U? A forbidden, and U is allowed? B, E, A, U, T -> A forbidden.
  ""DEBUT"" -> D forbidden.
  ""JEWET"" -> not common? J, E, W, E, T -> duplicate E? J is allowed? But not common.
  ""MEETT"" -> not a word.
  ""LEVET"" -> not common? L, E, V, E, T -> duplicate E, V is allowed.
  ""NEWT"" is 4 letters.

""BEVY"" is 4.

""HEART"" -> H, E, A, R, T -> A and R forbidden.

""WEIGHT"" -> 6 letters.

""YELPT"" -> Y, E, L, P, T -> P forbidden.

""KELLT"" -> not a word.

""MELLT"" -> not.

""WELLT"" -> not.

""HELMT"" -> not standard.

""BELTT"" -> duplicate T? B, E, L, T, T -> but we are putting T at position 5, and if we put T at position 4? Then we have two T's? Pattern: position 1: B, 2: E, 3: L, 4: T, 5: T -> but we know T is not at position 4? Because in guess2, T was at position 4 and it was wrong, and in guess3, T was at position 3 and wrong. But if the word has two T's, then we might have T at position 4? But we don't know.

But we are not sure, so we can try a word that doesn't put T at position 4 to avoid confusion.

But in the pattern for case 2, we are putting T at position 5, so we don't put T at position 4.

So we need a word ending with T, with E at position 2, and the first, third, and fourth letters from the available set.

Example: ""HEART"" -> forbidden.

""LEANT"" -> A and N forbidden.

""MEANT"" -> A and N.

""BEVAT"" -> not common? B, E, V, A, T -> A forbidden.

""LEVIT"" -> not common.

""HELOT"" -> H, E, L, O, T -> O forbidden.

""HEROT"" -> not common and R forbidden.

""MERIT"" -> R and I? M, E, R, I, T -> R and I forbidden.

""WELLY"" -> W, E, L, L, Y -> but ends with Y, not T.

We need to end with T.

""JETSET"" -> too long.

Perhaps ""BEGET"" -> B, E, G, E, T -> duplicate E? And ends with T. But we have E at position 2 and 4? And we are testing B and G.

But ""BEGET"" is a word.

Similarly, ""BESET"" -> S forbidden.

""DEMIT"" -> D forbidden.

""HEXED"" -> D and X? But D forbidden, and ends with D, not T.

""KEXYT"" -> not a word.

This is difficult. Maybe we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters.

Given the constraints, let's list possible words.

We know:
- Position 2 is E.
- T is at position 1 or 5.
- Forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,P,S,O,F,I,D.

Available letters: B, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, V, X, Z, etc.

Case 1: T at 1 -> T E _ _ _

We need three letters for positions 3,4,5.

Possible words:
  ""TELLY"" - T,E,L,L,Y (if accepted, but it's informal for television)
  ""TEETH"" - T,E,E,T,H (duplicates)
  ""TECHY"" - C forbidden
  ""TEPID"" - P forbidden
  ""TEMPO"" - P,O forbidden
  ""TERRY"" - R forbidden
  ""TESTY"" - S forbidden
  ""TEWEL"" - T,E,W,E,L (duplicate E) - but ""TEWEL"" is not common, maybe ""JEWEL"" but J at start?
  ""TEUCH"" - not common.

""TELLY"" might be acceptable in some dictionaries. Or ""TELEX"" - T,E,L,E,X (duplicate E) - ""TELEX"" is a word.

""TELEX"": T (1), E (2), L (3), E (4), X (5) -> duplicate E.

But we can use it.

Case 2: T at 5 -> _ E _ _ T

Possible words:
  ""BEVET"" - not common
  ""HEVET"" - not
  ""LEVET"" - L,E,V,E,T (duplicate E) - ""LEVET"" is not common, but ""LEVET"" might be a surname?
  ""MEVET"" - not
  ""WEVET"" - not
  ""YELPT"" - P forbidden
  ""MELTY"" - M,E,L,T,Y -> but ends with Y, not T. We need T at end.

""GUEST"" -> S forbidden.

""BUILT"" -> U,I -> I forbidden.

""BELTT"" - not a word.

""BELLT"" - not.

""CELLT"" - C forbidden.

""HELLT"" - not.

""WELLT"" - not.

""BEGET"" - B,E,G,E,T -> duplicate E.

""BESET"" - S forbidden.

""BEMUD"" - D forbidden.

""BEMIX"" - B,E,M,I,X -> I forbidden.

""HEXET"" - not a word.

""KEXES"" - S forbidden.

This is challenging.

Perhaps we missed a word.

Another idea: ""THUMB"" -> but T at 1, then H,U,M,B -> but pattern is T E _ _ _, so second letter must be E, not H.

So not.

Or for case 2: ""CHEST"" -> C and S forbidden.

Let's think of common words.

Perhaps ""THEFT"" -> T,H,E,F,T -> but F is forbidden (from guess3: F not in word) and duplicate T? And pattern: if T at 1, then H at 2? But we need E at 2. So not.

Another: ""SWEET"" -> S forbidden.

""TWEET"" -> T,W,E,E,T -> duplicate T and E, and S not used? T,W,E,E,T: positions 1:T, 2:W? But we need E at position 2. So not.

We must have E at position 2.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might be ""THEME"" -> but T at 1, H at 2? No, we need E at 2.

Unless it's ""THEME"" with E at 2? T, H, E, M, E -> position 2 is H, not E.

Not.

""TEETH"" is a word: T, E, E, T, H -> position 2 is E, so it fits case 1.

And it has duplicate E and T.

Similarly, ""BELLE"" -> B,E,L,L,E -> duplicate L and E, and ends with E, not T.

But we need T in the word.

""BELLE"" has no T.

""BETTY"" -> B,E,T,T,Y -> duplicate T, and pattern: if T at 5? B,E,T,T,Y -> position 5 is Y, not T. If we want T at 5, then ""BETTY"" has T at position 3 and 4, not 5.

But we know T is not at position 3 or 4, so ""BETTY"" would not be possible.

Similarly, ""METAL"" -> A forbidden.

Perhaps ""LETHE"" -> L,E,T,H,E -> duplicate E, and ends with E, not T. But we have T at position 3, which we know is not allowed (from guess3: T not at position 3).

So not.

""LITHE"" -> I forbidden.

After reviewing, possible words might be:

For case 1: T at 1
  ""TEETH"" - T,E,E,T,H -> positions: 1:T, 2:E, 3:E, 4:T, 5:H
  But we know T is not at position 4 (from guess2: T not at position 4), so if the word has T at position 4, it would be a different T? But if there are two T's, it's possible. However, in ""TEETH"", there is a T at position 4, which we know is not the correct position for the T that is in the word? No, the feedback doesn't specify which T. It just says T is in the word but not at position 4. If the word has two T's, one at position 1 and one at position 4, then the T at position 4 is still in the word, but in the wrong position? So it would be marked as present but wrong position? But in guess2, when we put T at position 4, we got a minus, which means that particular position is wrong, but it doesn't say anything about other T's.

But in ""TEETH"", if we have T at position 1 and 4, then the T at position 4 is in the word, but not at that position? Yes, so it would be marked as present but wrong position if we guess it at position 4.

But in our case, for ""TEETH"", we are not guessing it yet, but it is a candidate.

Similarly, for case 2: T at 5
  ""BEGET"" - B,E,G,E,T -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:E, 5:T
  Here, T is at position 5, and we have E at position 2 and 4.

We know T is in the word, and not at position 3 or 4, so position 5 is possible.

Also, we have E at position 4, which might be duplicate.

Now, we have to choose a guess that can distinguish or fit.

But we have only a few letters left to use.

Perhaps we can guess ""TEETH"" to test case 1.

Or ""BEGET"" to test case 2.

But let's see what letters we can test.

We have not used: B, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, V, X, Z.

In ""TEETH"", we would test T at position 1 and 4 (but we know T at position 4 is not correct, so we expect a minus for position 4, and if the word has T at position 1, we get a check, and also test H at position 5.

In ""BEGET"", we test B at 1, G at 3, E at 4 (which might be duplicate), and T at 5.

But we know E is at position 2, so if we get a check for E at position 4, then there is a duplicate E.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't have duplicates and tests new letters.

For example, for case 1: T at 1, we can try ""TEGUS"" -> S forbidden, and not 5 letters? ""TEGU"" is 4.

""TELES"" -> S forbidden.

""TEHOU"" -> not a word.

""TEKKE"" -> duplicate E and K? T,E,K,K,E -> not common.

""TEMSE"" -> S forbidden.

""TENGE"" -> N forbidden.

""TEREK"" -> R forbidden.

""TETRA"" -> R and A forbidden.

""TEWIT"" -> T,E,W,I,T -> I forbidden and duplicate T.

""THUJA"" -> H,U,J,A -> A forbidden.

""THUMP"" -> H,U,M,P -> P forbidden.

""THYME"" -> H,Y,M,E -> duplicate E? T,H,Y,M,E -> position 2 is H, not E. Not.

For case 2: T at 5, try ""GAMUT"" -> A forbidden.

""HABUT"" -> A forbidden.

""JUMAR"" -> not.

""LEMUT"" -> not.

""MAUT"" is 4.

""REBUT"" -> R forbidden.

""UMIAC"" -> not.

""UNGET"" -> U,N,G,E,T -> N forbidden.

""USENT"" -> not.

""VOMIT"" -> O and I forbidden.

""WEMBS"" -> S forbidden.

""YENTE"" -> E at position 2? Y,E,N,T,E -> N forbidden and duplicate E.

""YETIS"" -> S and I forbidden.

""YUKTY"" -> not.

So it seems that with the letters available, the only common words might have duplicates or use forbidden letters.

Perhaps ""LIGHT"" -> but pattern: L,I,G,H,T -> I forbidden, and position 2 is I, not E.

Not.

"" might"" -> M,I,G,H,T -> I forbidden.

""BIGHT"" -> B,I,G,H,T -> I forbidden.

"" fight"" -> F forbidden.

"" wight"" -> W,I,G,H,T -> I forbidden.

""HEIGHT"" -> 6 letters.

""EIGHT"" -> E,I,G,H,T -> position 1 is E, but we need position 2 to be E, so position 1 is I? E at 1, I at 2? Not.

We need position 2 to be E.

So back to the two cases.

Perhaps ""THEFT"" is not possible because of F and position 2 not E.

Another idea: ""BERTH"" -> B,E,R,T,H -> R forbidden.

""PERth"" -> P and R forbidden.

"" earth"" -> A and R.

"" berth"" -> R.

I think we have to consider that the word might be ""TEETH"" or ""BEGET"".

Or ""MEET "" with T? ""MEETT"" not a word.

""BEVET"" not.

Let's search for words ending with T and E at position 2.

For example, ""DWELT"" -> D forbidden.

""FELT"" 4 letters.

""GELT"" -> G,E,L,T -> 4 letters.

""KELT"" -> 4.

"" belt"" -> B,E,L,T -> 4.

""CELT"" -> C.

""DELT"" -> D.

"" felt"" -> F.

"" pelt"" -> P.

"" welt"" -> W,E,L,T -> 4 letters.

5-letter words: ""BEGET"", ""BESET"" (S), ""RELET"" (R), ""DEFET"" (D), ""REFET"" (R), ""REFUT"" (R), ""REGUT"" not, ""REMIT"" (R,I), etc.

""HEIST"" (S,I).

So ""BEGET"" is a possibility.

Similarly, for T at 1, ""TEETH"" is a possibility.

We can guess ""TEETH"" to test.

If we guess ""TEETH"":

- T at position 1: if correct, we get a check, else if not in word, we get x, but we know T is in the word, so if not at 1, then it must be at 5, so we would get x for T at 1, but then we know T is at 5.

- E at position 2: check.
- E at position 3: if the word has E at position 3, we get a check or minus? If it's in the word but not at position 3, minus, or if not in the word, x, but we know E is at position 2, so if there is another E, it might be at position 3 or not.

But it's messy.

Perhaps guess a word that has T at position 5 and no duplicate letters, but we couldn't find one.

Another word: ""LEAPT"" -> A and P forbidden.

""WEARY"" -> not ending with T.

""YEUKY"" -> not.

I think we have to go with ""BEGET"" or ""TEETH"".

Let's choose ""BEGET"" because it has T at position 5, which we haven't tested yet.

So guess ""BEGET"".

But ""BEGET"" has B at 1, E at 2 (correct), G at 3, E at 4, T at 5.

We know E is at position 2, so position 4 E might be duplicate.

We are testing B, G, and T at 5.

If T is at position 5, we get a check.

If not, then T must be at position 1, and we get x for T at 5, and then we know the word must have T at 1.

Also, for position 4 E: if we get a check, then there is a duplicate E; if minus, then E is not at position 4; if x, then no duplicate E? But we know E is in the word at position 2, so if we get x for E at position 4, it means there is no second E.

Similarly for B and G.

So it can give us information.

Therefore, I'll go with ""BEGET"".Based on the feedback:
- **E** is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from previous guesses).
- **T** is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from ""pesto"" and ""fetid"" feedback).
- The word does **not** contain C, R, A, N, P, S, O, F, I, or D (all marked ""x"").

The secret word pattern is: _ E _ _ _

Since **T** must be in position 1 or 5 (the only remaining positions), we have two cases:
1. **T E _ _ _**
2. ** _ E _ _ T**

For the next guess:
- Test **T** in position 5 (to distinguish between the two cases).
- Avoid forbidden letters.
- Include new common letters (e.g., B, G) to gather more information.

A suitable guess is **""BEGET""**:
- **B** (position 1), **E** (position 2, correct), **G** (position 3), **E** (position 4), **T** (position 5).
- Tests **T** in position 5 (if correct, we get a ✓; if not, T must be in position 1).
- Tests **B** and **G** as new letters.
- Checks for a potential second **E** (position 4).

<guess>beget</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Known Information**:
   - The secret word has **E** in the second position (✓ from ""pesto"" and ""fetid"").
   - **T** is in the word but **not in position 3 or 4** (from ""pesto"" and ""fetid"" feedback).
   - The word **does not contain**: C, R, A, N, P, S, O, F, I, D (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
   - The pattern is: `_ E _ _ _`.
   - **T must be in position 1 or 5** (the only positions left since positions 3 and 4 are ruled out).

2. **Strategy for the Next Guess**:
   - **Test T in position 5**: This helps distinguish between the two possible patterns:
     - If T is correct in position 5, the pattern is `_ E _ _ T`.
     - If T is absent (x) or wrong position (-) in position 5, then T must be in position 1 (`T E _ _ _`).
   - **Avoid forbidden letters**: Do not use C, R, A, N, P, S, O, F, I, D.
   - **Test new common letters**: Prioritize high-frequency unused letters like B, G, H, L, M, U, W, Y to maximize information.
   - **Check for duplicate E**: Since E is confirmed in position 2, placing E in position 4 tests for a possible second E.

3. **Choosing the Guess: ""BEGET""**:
   - **B** (position 1): Tests a new common consonant (B is the 16th most common English letter).
   - **E** (position 2): Confirmed correct (✓), so no new info but maintains the pattern.
   - **G** (position 3): Tests a new common consonant (G is the 20th most common letter).
   - **E** (position 4): Tests for a duplicate E (if present, we get ✓ or -; if absent, we get x).
   - **T** (position 5): Directly tests the critical position for T.
   - **Why ""BEGET""?** 
     - It fits the constraints (no forbidden letters).
     - It tests two new letters (B and G) and the position of T efficiently.
     - If T is not in position 5, we immediately know it must be in position 1 for future guesses.
     - It is a valid 5-letter word.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If **T is ✓ in position 5**, the word ends with T (pattern `_ E _ _ T`), and we focus on positions 1, 3, and 4.
   - If **T is - or x in position 5**, T must be in position 1 (pattern `T E _ _ _`), and we focus on positions 3, 4, and 5.
   - Feedback on B, G, and the second E will further narrow down possibilities.",Guess 4: beget -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) E(✓) G(✓) E(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
