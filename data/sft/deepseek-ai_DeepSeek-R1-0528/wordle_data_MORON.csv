We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, the secret word contains R and N, but not C, A, or E.
 R and N are in the word, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and N was in position 4.

 We know:
 - The word has 5 letters.
 - Contains R and N, but not C, A, E.
 - R cannot be in position 2, and N cannot be in position 4.

 Since A and E are vowels and are excluded, the word might have other vowels like I, O, U. Also, we have to consider consonants.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Does not contain C, A, E (because they are marked as not in the word).
 - Includes R and N (since we know they are in the word) but in different positions from guess 1 (so R not in position 2, N not in position 4).

 We can try to use other common letters and include R and N.

 Let's think of words that have R and N, and avoid C, A, E.

 Possible words: 
   - R at different positions: not position 2.
   - N at different positions: not position 4.

 Example: ""ROBIN"" -> but it has O and I which are vowels? But wait, ROBIN: R in position 1? But in our first guess, R was in position 2 and now position 1 is a candidate? Also, B and I are new.

 However, note that in ""crane"", position 2 was R and now it's wrong, so in the new word, R is not at position 2.

 Let me check some words:

 Alternative: Let's choose a word that has R and N, and other letters that are common and not excluded.

 Since we know that R and N are present, we might want to test other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants.

 Another idea: ""POINT"" -> but does it have R? No. We must include R.

 So, we need to include R and N.

 Let me try: ""PRINT"" -> P, R, I, N, T.
 But check positions: 
   In ""PRINT"":
     R is in position 2 -> but wait, in the secret word R cannot be in position 2? Because in our first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong position (meaning that it's not there, but present elsewhere). So, in the secret word R might be at 1,3,4, or 5. So having R at position 2 is not allowed? Actually, the feedback for R was (-) which means it's in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again.

 Therefore, in ""PRINT"", R is at position 2 again. That's not allowed because we know R is not at position 2? Actually, we can try but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we avoid position 2 for R.

 How about ""ROUND""? R is at position 1, which is allowed. Also, N is at position 4? Wait, in the first guess N was at position 4 and it was marked wrong position. So N cannot be at position 4 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback for N was (-) meaning N is in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 again? And similarly, R not at position 2.

 In ""ROUND"": 
   R is at 1 (good, because not position 2)
   N is at 4? That's the same position as the first guess, but we know N isn't at position 4? Actually, the secret word has N somewhere else. So placing N at position 4 again would be incorrect because we know that in the secret word N is not in position 4. Therefore, we must avoid putting N in position 4 in our next guess? Or can we? 

 Actually, we can, but it would give us information only if it turns out to be correct? However, we already know that it is not in that position, so it's better to try a different position.

 Therefore, let's avoid position 2 for R and position 4 for N.

 So, for second guess, we want:
 - R and N must be in positions other than 2 and 4 respectively.
 - Avoid C, A, E.

 Other possibilities: 
   - R in position 1,3,5 and N in position 1,2,3,5? But note: the word may have duplicate letters? Well, the rules don't say it can't, but usually Wordle words have distinct letters? Actually, the rules don't specify, so we should consider words with repeated letters as possible? However, the feedback doesn't indicate double letters explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if the secret word has two of the same letter and you guess one in the correct position and one missing, the feedback can be tricky. But in this case, we have no indication of double letters so far.

 Let me pick a word that has R and N, in new positions, and avoids the forbidden letters.

 Some ideas:
   Option 1: ""ROBIN"": 
        R at 1 (okay, not 2)
        O at 2
        B at 3
        I at 4
        N at 5? Wait, but in the first guess N was at 4 and now we put it at 5? That's okay because position 5 is new. 

        So: ROBIN -> has R (pos1), N (pos5) -> avoids R at 2 and N at 4.

   Option 2: ""GROIN"":
        G at 1
        R at 2 -> but wait, we cannot put R in position 2? Because we know R is not at position 2. So no.

   Option 3: ""HORNS"":
        H at 1
        O at 2
        R at 3 -> fine (because not 2)
        N at 4 -> but we know N is not at 4? So avoid.

   Option 4: ""WORN"" isn't 5 letters.

   Option 5: ""PRONG"":
        P at 1
        R at 2 -> not allowed (avoid position 2 for R)
        O at 3
        N at 4 -> avoid?
        G at 5

   So avoid that.

   Option 6: ""BORNS""? No, not a word? or ""borns"" is not a valid word.

   Option 7: ""RUNNY"" -> that has double N? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? And it's not standard Wordle? Actually, the rules didn't forbid it, but let's assume valid English words.

   However, we have to stick to valid English words.

   Let's try ""IRONY"":
        I at 1
        R at 2 -> avoid? position 2 again? So no.

   Option 8: ""TRUNK"": 
        T at 1
        R at 2 -> avoid.

   Option 9: ""KRONA"" -> but A is excluded? No, because we cannot use A.

   How about ""CROWN"" -> but C is excluded? We cannot use C.

   Another: ""PROUD"": 
        P at 1
        R at 2 -> avoid.

   How about ""ROWDY"": 
        R at 1 (ok)
        O at 2
        W at 3
        D at 4
        Y at 5 -> but no N? We need to include N because we know it's in the word.

   Therefore, let's look for words with R and N, and without C, A, E.

   We want R not in position 2 and N not in position 4.

   Example: ""RONIN"" -> but that is a word? And would have R at 1, N at 5? Wait: R O N I N? That has two N's? And positions: 
        R at 1 (ok)
        O at 2
        N at 3 -> then I at 4 and N at 5? Actually, ""ronin"" is R O N I N, so N at 3 and 5. Then position 3 is new, position 5 is new? So not at position 4? That might be acceptable.

   But we are avoiding C, A, E, and using R, O, N, I.

   Alternatively, ""ROBIN"" seems a good choice: 
        R (1), O (2), B (3), I (4), N (5) -> positions: 
          R: position 1 (good, not 2)
          N: position 5 (good, not 4)

   Also, ""ROBIN"" is a valid English word.

   Therefore, I will guess ""ROBIN"".

   But note: we are also testing O and B and I. 

   Let me see if there are other options: ""URN"" but 3 letters? Not 5.

   Or ""BRINY"": 
        B at 1
        R at 2 -> avoid? because R was at position 2 and we know that's not correct? So we should avoid position 2.

   Therefore, ""ROBIN"" is a good candidate.

   However, what about ""ROYAL""? But A is excluded, and also no N? So no.

   So, second guess: ""ROBIN""

 Let's output that.

<guess>robin</guess>

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and E are not in the word (marked with x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with -).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (marked with -).

For the next guess:
1. Must include R and N, but avoid placing R in position 2 or N in position 4.
2. Cannot contain C, A, or E.
3. Should test new common letters like O, B, and I.

I chose ""ROBIN"" because:
- R is in position 1 (a new position for R, avoiding position 2).
- N is in position 5 (a new position for N, avoiding position 4).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, E).
- It introduces new vowels (O, I) and consonant (B) to gather more feedback.

 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, the secret word contains R and N, but not C, A, or E.
 R and N are in the word, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and N was in position 4.

 We know:
 - The word has 5 letters.
 - Contains R and N, but not C, A, E.
 - R cannot be in position 2, and N cannot be in position 4.

 Since A and E are vowels and are excluded, the word might have other vowels like I, O, U. Also, we have to consider consonants.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Does not contain C, A, E (because they are marked as not in the word).
 - Includes R and N (since we know they are in the word) but in different positions from guess 1 (so R not in position 2, N not in position 4).

 We can try to use other common letters and include R and N.

 Let's think of words that have R and N, and avoid C, A, E.

 Possible words: 
   - R at different positions: not position 2.
   - N at different positions: not position 4.

 Example: ""ROBIN"" -> but it has O and I which are vowels? But wait, ROBIN: R in position 1? But in our first guess, R was in position 2 and now position 1 is a candidate? Also, B and I are new.

 However, note that in ""crane"", position 2 was R and now it's wrong, so in the new word, R is not at position 2.

 Let me check some words:

 Alternative: Let's choose a word that has R and N, and other letters that are common and not excluded.

 Since we know that R and N are present, we might want to test other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants.

 Another idea: ""POINT"" -> but does it have R? No. We must include R.

 So, we need to include R and N.

 Let me try: ""PRINT"" -> P, R, I, N, T.
 But check positions: 
   In ""PRINT"":
     R is in position 2 -> but wait, in the secret word R cannot be in position 2? Because in our first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong position (meaning that it's not there, but present elsewhere). So, in the secret word R might be at 1,3,4, or 5. So having R at position 2 is not allowed? Actually, the feedback for R was (-) which means it's in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again.

 Therefore, in ""PRINT"", R is at position 2 again. That's not allowed because we know R is not at position 2? Actually, we can try but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we avoid position 2 for R.

 How about ""ROUND""? R is at position 1, which is allowed. Also, N is at position 4? Wait, in the first guess N was at position 4 and it was marked wrong position. So N cannot be at position 4 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback for N was (-) meaning N is in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 again? And similarly, R not at position 2.

 In ""ROUND"": 
   R is at 1 (good, because not position 2)
   N is at 4? That's the same position as the first guess, but we know N isn't at position 4? Actually, the secret word has N somewhere else. So placing N at position 4 again would be incorrect because we know that in the secret word N is not in position 4. Therefore, we must avoid putting N in position 4 in our next guess? Or can we? 

 Actually, we can, but it would give us information only if it turns out to be correct? However, we already know that it is not in that position, so it's better to try a different position.

 Therefore, let's avoid position 2 for R and position 4 for N.

 So, for second guess, we want:
 - R and N must be in positions other than 2 and 4 respectively.
 - Avoid C, A, E.

 Other possibilities: 
   - R in position 1,3,5 and N in position 1,2,3,5? But note: the word may have duplicate letters? Well, the rules don't say it can't, but usually Wordle words have distinct letters? Actually, the rules don't specify, so we should consider words with repeated letters as possible? However, the feedback doesn't indicate double letters explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if the secret word has two of the same letter and you guess one in the correct position and one missing, the feedback can be tricky. But in this case, we have no indication of double letters so far.

 Let me pick a word that has R and N, in new positions, and avoids the forbidden letters.

 Some ideas:
   Option 1: ""ROBIN"": 
        R at 1 (okay, not 2)
        O at 2
        B at 3
        I at 4
        N at 5? Wait, but in the first guess N was at 4 and now we put it at 5? That's okay because position 5 is new. 

        So: ROBIN -> has R (pos1), N (pos5) -> avoids R at 2 and N at 4.

   Option 2: ""GROIN"":
        G at 1
        R at 2 -> but wait, we cannot put R in position 2? Because we know R is not at position 2. So no.

   Option 3: ""HORNS"":
        H at 1
        O at 2
        R at 3 -> fine (because not 2)
        N at 4 -> but we know N is not at 4? So avoid.

   Option 4: ""WORN"" isn't 5 letters.

   Option 5: ""PRONG"":
        P at 1
        R at 2 -> not allowed (avoid position 2 for R)
        O at 3
        N at 4 -> avoid?
        G at 5

   So avoid that.

   Option 6: ""BORNS""? No, not a word? or ""borns"" is not a valid word.

   Option 7: ""RUNNY"" -> that has double N? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? And it's not standard Wordle? Actually, the rules didn't forbid it, but let's assume valid English words.

   However, we have to stick to valid English words.

   Let's try ""IRONY"":
        I at 1
        R at 2 -> avoid? position 2 again? So no.

   Option 8: ""TRUNK"": 
        T at 1
        R at 2 -> avoid.

   Option 9: ""KRONA"" -> but A is excluded? No, because we cannot use A.

   How about ""CROWN"" -> but C is excluded? We cannot use C.

   Another: ""PROUD"": 
        P at 1
        R at 2 -> avoid.

   How about ""ROWDY"": 
        R at 1 (ok)
        O at 2
        W at 3
        D at 4
        Y at 5 -> but no N? We need to include N because we know it's in the word.

   Therefore, let's look for words with R and N, and without C, A, E.

   We want R not in position 2 and N not in position 4.

   Example: ""RONIN"" -> but that is a word? And would have R at 1, N at 5? Wait: R O N I N? That has two N's? And positions: 
        R at 1 (ok)
        O at 2
        N at 3 -> then I at 4 and N at 5? Actually, ""ronin"" is R O N I N, so N at 3 and 5. Then position 3 is new, position 5 is new? So not at position 4? That might be acceptable.

   But we are avoiding C, A, E, and using R, O, N, I.

   Alternatively, ""ROBIN"" seems a good choice: 
        R (1), O (2), B (3), I (4), N (5) -> positions: 
          R: position 1 (good, not 2)
          N: position 5 (good, not 4)

   Also, ""ROBIN"" is a valid English word.

   Therefore, I will guess ""ROBIN"".

   But note: we are also testing O and B and I. 

   Let me see if there are other options: ""URN"" but 3 letters? Not 5.

   Or ""BRINY"": 
        B at 1
        R at 2 -> avoid? because R was at position 2 and we know that's not correct? So we should avoid position 2.

   Therefore, ""ROBIN"" is a good candidate.

   However, what about ""ROYAL""? But A is excluded, and also no N? So no.

   So, second guess: ""ROBIN""

 Let's output that.

<guess>robin</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and E are not in the word (marked with x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with -).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (marked with -).

For the next guess:
1. Must include R and N, but avoid placing R in position 2 or N in position 4.
2. Cannot contain C, A, or E.
3. Should test new common letters like O, B, and I.

I chose ""ROBIN"" because:
- R is in position 1 (a new position for R, avoiding position 2).
- N is in position 5 (a new position for N, avoiding position 4).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, E).
- It introduces new vowels (O, I) and consonant (B) to gather more feedback.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, wrong position) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 4
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""robin""
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> R is in the word, but not at position 1 (because we put it at position 1 in this guess and it's wrong)
  O: ✓ (correct position) -> so O is in the word and at position 2
  B: x (not in word)
  I: x (not in word)
  N: ✓ (correct position) -> so N is in the word and at position 5

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The word has O at position 2 and N at position 5. So the word is: _ O _ _ N

2. R is in the word, but it cannot be at position 2 (from first guess) and also cannot be at position 1 (from second guess). So R must be at position 3 or 4.

3. Letters that are not in the word: C, A, E, B, I (from the x's in both guesses)

4. We also know that from the first guess, N was not at position 4 (but now we know it's at position 5, so that's consistent).

Now, we need to find a word that fits: _ O _ _ N, with R in position 3 or 4, and without C, A, E, B, I.

Also, we have to consider that the word must be a 5-letter English word.

Let's list possible letters for the remaining positions:

Position 1: cannot be C, A, E, B, I, and also cannot be R? Wait, R is already in the word but we don't know where. But position 1: we don't have any constraint that forbids a letter we haven't tried? Actually, we haven't tried many letters. But we know R is in the word and must be at 3 or 4, so position 1 must be a letter that is not R? Because if R were at position 1, it would have been correct in the second guess? But in the second guess, we had R at position 1 and it was marked as wrong position? That means R is not at position 1. So position 1 cannot be R.

Similarly, position 3 and 4: one of them must be R, and the other is an unknown letter.

Also, position 3 and 4: cannot be any of the excluded letters: C, A, E, B, I.

So the word structure: 
  Position 1: any letter except C, A, E, B, I, and also not R (since R is not at position 1). Also, it must be a letter we haven't excluded.
  Position 2: O (fixed)
  Position 3: either R or another letter? But note: R must be in the word and can only be at 3 or 4. So if position 3 is R, then position 4 is another letter. If position 3 is not R, then position 4 must be R.
  Position 4: same as above.
  Position 5: N (fixed)

We also need to consider that the word must be valid.

Let's think of words that end with ""ON"" and have O at the second position.

Possible words:

Option 1: R at position 3: then the word is _ O R _ N

Option 2: R at position 4: then the word is _ O _ R N

Now, we need to fill the blanks.

First, for position 1: we can use letters that are not excluded. Excluded: C, A, E, B, I. So available: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and also common ones).

But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

Let's try to list words of the form _ O R _ N:

Examples: 
  ""CORN"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5. So 5-letter words: 
  ""HORNS"" -> but we have N at position 5? ""HORNS"" is H O R N S -> but then position 4 is N? But we have position 5 as N? No, that doesn't match. Our pattern is _ O R _ N, so the last letter is N, so the word must end with ""N"", so the fourth letter must be the one before the last. 

Actually, the pattern is: 
  position 1: ?
  position 2: O
  position 3: R
  position 4: ?
  position 5: N

So the word is ? O R ? N

What words are there? 
  ""TORN"" is 4 letters. 
  ""HORNS"" is H O R N S -> that's positions: H(1), O(2), R(3), N(4), S(5) -> but we need position 5 to be N? Here position 5 is S. So not.

  ""BORNS"" -> not a word? and B is excluded.

  ""CORNS"" -> C is excluded, and also it's C O R N S -> again, position 5 is S, not N.

  ""FORMS"" -> F O R M S -> not ending with N.

  We need the word to end with N? Yes, because position 5 is N.

  So the word must end with ""?N"", and the third letter is R? So the last two letters are the fourth letter and then N.

  Examples: 
    ""HORNS"" doesn't work because it ends with ""NS"", not ""?N"" with the fourth letter being the one we are looking for.

  Actually, the pattern is: ... R ? N -> so the last two are the fourth letter and then N. So the word ends with two letters: (letter at 4) and then N.

  So the word is: [letter1] O R [letter4] N

  What are some words? 
    ""WORN"" is 4 letters.
    ""TORN"" is 4 letters.

  How about ""PORTS"" -> but that ends with S? Not N.

  I'm struggling. Maybe there are no common words of the form ? O R ? N.

  Let me think: ""MOURN"" -> M O U R N? 
    Positions: 
      1: M
      2: O
      3: U
      4: R
      5: N

  But in this case, R is at position 4, not 3. So that's the other pattern.

  So let's try the other pattern: R at position 4: then the word is _ O _ R N

  So pattern: [1] O [3] R N

  Now, position 3 is not R? But we have R at position 4.

  So the word: ? O ? R N

  Examples:
    ""MOURN"": M O U R N -> matches: M(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), N(5) -> perfect.

  But we have to check the excluded letters: M, O, U, R, N. 
    M: not excluded? 
    U: not excluded? 
    O: is included and at position 2 (correct)
    R: at position 4 (we don't know if that's correct yet, but we know R is in the word and must be at 3 or 4, so 4 is possible)
    N: at position 5 (correct)

  Also, excluded letters: C, A, E, B, I. M and U are not in that list.

  So ""MOURN"" is a candidate.

  Other words?
    ""DOURN""? Not a word.
    ""GOURN""? Not a word.
    ""POURN""? Not a word.
    ""TOURN""? Not a word.
    ""HOURN""? Not a word.

  How about ""BORNE""? But B and E are excluded.

  ""FORUM""? Doesn't end with RN.

  ""HORDE""? Ends with E? But E is excluded.

  ""LORRY""? Doesn't end with N.

  ""MOURN"" seems a valid word.

  But wait, in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. In the second guess, we had R at position 1 and it was wrong. Now in ""MOURN"", R is at position 4. That's acceptable.

  Also, we have to check if there are other possibilities.

  Another word: ""TOURED""? 6 letters.

  ""YOURN""? Not a word.

  ""SOURN""? Not a word.

  ""DOUR"" is 4 letters.

  So ""MOURN"" is a strong candidate.

  But let me check if there are words with R at position 3? We had trouble, but maybe:

  ""FORM"" is 4 letters.

  ""WORM"" is 4.

  ""GORM"" is not 5.

  ""NORTH"" -> N O R T H -> but then position 1 is N? But we have N at position 5? And in this word, N is at position 1 and 5? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback, we have N at position 5 correct, and in the first guess N was at position 4 and wrong. But if the word has two N's? Then the feedback for the first guess would have shown one N as present? Actually, in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out that the word has two N's? But in the second guess, we have N at position 5 and it's correct. So if the word has two N's, then the first guess N at position 4 would be marked as present (which it was) and the second guess N at position 5 is correct. But in the word ""NORTH"", we have N at position 1 and position 5? No, ""NORTH"" is N O R T H -> only one N at position 1? Then position 5 is H? So that doesn't match our pattern because we need position 5 to be N.

  How about ""HORNS""? We already saw it doesn't end with N.

  Another idea: ""CORNY"" -> but C is excluded.

  ""SORRY"" -> two R's? And ends with Y? Not N.

  So it seems the only common word that fits the pattern is ""MOURN"".

  But wait, what about ""DOORN""? Not a word.

  Or ""POORI"" -> not ending with N.

  So I think ""MOURN"" is the best candidate.

  However, we must consider that we haven't tested M and U. But we have to make a guess.

  Alternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we have only 6 tries and we are at the third guess. And we have two letters fixed: O at 2 and N at 5, and R must be at 3 or 4. So if we guess ""MOURN"", we might get it right.

  But let me double-check the feedback we have:

  We know:
    O at 2, N at 5, R at 4 (if we guess ""MOURN"", then R is at 4) and we have M and U.

  But we don't have any information about M and U. However, if we guess ""MOURN"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on M and U.

  Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more common letters? But we have many letters excluded.

  Since we have only two positions to fill (position 1 and 3) and R must be at 3 or 4, but in our pattern for ""MOURN"", we have R at 4 and U at 3.

  Another possibility: what if R is at position 3? Then the word is ? O R ? N. We couldn't find a common word, but maybe there is one.

  Let me think: ""TORAN"" -> but A is excluded? And not a common word? Also, A is excluded.

  ""BORAX"" -> B and A excluded.

  ""GORGE"" -> E excluded.

  ""FORUM"" -> ends with M? Not N.

  ""YORKS"" -> ends with S? Not N.

  ""WORKS"" -> same.

  ""FORKY"" -> not a word.

  So I think ""MOURN"" is the most likely.

  But wait, there's ""PORTS"" but doesn't end with N.

  Another word: ""MORON"" -> M O R O N? 
    Positions: M(1), O(2), R(3), O(4), N(5)
    This has two O's? 
    Now, check: 
      Position 2: O (correct)
      Position 5: N (correct)
      R at position 3? That's allowed because R must be at 3 or 4.
      But we have O at position 4? Is that allowed? We don't have any feedback about O being duplicated? But the feedback for the second guess: O was at position 2 and correct. If the word has two O's, then in the second guess we only had one O? So we wouldn't know about the second O? 

  But in ""MORON"", we have O at position 2 and 4. In the second guess, we only tested O at position 2 and it was correct. We didn't test position 4. So it's possible.

  Now, check excluded letters: M, O, R, O, N. M, R, N are not excluded. O is allowed. But we have two O's? Is that allowed? The rules don't forbid duplicate letters.

  However, in the feedback for the first guess, we had only one R and one N? But the word might have duplicates.

  But in ""MORON"", we have two O's. We haven't tested O at position 4? So it's possible.

  Also, in the first guess, we had A and E which are excluded, but O is not excluded.

  So ""MORON"" is also a candidate.

  Now, we have two candidates: ""MOURN"" and ""MORON"".

  How to decide? We can choose one that tests more letters? 

  In ""MOURN"", we test M and U.
  In ""MORON"", we test M and O (again) and also we are testing if there is a duplicate O? But we already know O is in the word at position 2, so if we get feedback for ""MORON"", we might see if O is at position 4? 

  But we are at the third guess, and we have limited tries. We might want to guess the word if possible.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use M? Because we haven't tested M? But we have to use some letter.

  Another candidate: ""DOZEN"" -> but E is excluded? And D is not excluded? But we have O at 2 and N at 5? ""DOZEN"": D O Z E N -> E is excluded? So no.

  ""GOWN"" is 4 letters.

  ""SOUTH"" -> ends with H? Not N.

  ""FOUND"" -> ends with D? Not N.

  ""POUND"" -> same.

  So between ""MOURN"" and ""MORON"", which one?

  Let me see the frequency? Or we can choose one that doesn't use a duplicate if we are unsure about duplicates? But we don't have information.

  Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't use M? But we don't have many options.

  Another word: ""LOURN""? Not a word.

  ""TOURN""? Not a word.

  ""WOUND"" -> ends with D? Not N.

  ""HOUND"" -> same.

  ""ROUND"" -> R O U N D -> but then position 4 is N? And position 5 is D? But we need position 5 to be N? So no.

  So I think we have to choose between ""MOURN"" and ""MORON"".

  But note: in ""MORON"", we have O at position 4. We already know O is at position 2. If the word has two O's, that's fine. But we don't know.

  However, in the second guess, we had ""ROBIN"" and we got O at position 2 correct and N at position 5 correct. The other letters: R was present but wrong position (we had it at 1, but it's not at 1) and B and I were absent. 

  Now, if the word is ""MORON"", then the R would be at position 3? And we have O at 2 and 4, and N at 5. Then in the second guess, when we guessed ""ROBIN"", we had:
    R at 1: present but wrong position -> because in the secret word R is at 3? So that's consistent.
    O at 2: correct -> matches.
    B: absent -> correct because ""MORON"" has no B.
    I: absent -> correct.
    N at 5: correct.

  So ""MORON"" is consistent with the feedback.

  Similarly, ""MOURN"" is also consistent: 
    In ""ROBIN"": 
        R at 1: present but wrong position -> in ""MOURN"", R is at 4, so that's correct.
        O at 2: correct.
        B: absent -> correct.
        I: absent -> correct.
        N at 5: correct.

  So both are consistent.

  We need to break the tie.

  We can try to think of other words? 

  Another possibility: ""FORUM"" is not 5? It is 5, but ends with M? Not N.

  ""GORGE"" not.

  ""YORKS"" not.

  ""PORKS"" not.

  ""FORKY"" not.

  ""WORDY"" -> W O R D Y -> but then position 5 is Y? Not N.

  So we have two candidates.

  How about ""HORNY""? 
    H O R N Y -> 
      Position 1: H
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: R
      Position 4: N -> but we have N at position 5? And in this word, position 4 is N? But we know from the first guess that N is not at position 4? Because in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position? That means the secret word has N, but not at position 4. So if we put N at position 4 in a guess, it would be wrong? But in the secret word, if it were ""HORNY"", then N is at position 4? That would contradict the first guess feedback? 

  Let me check: 
    First guess: ""crane"" had N at position 4. If the secret word is ""HORNY"", then N is at position 4? Then the feedback for the first guess would have marked N as correct? But it was marked as present but wrong position? So that means N is not at position 4. Therefore, ""HORNY"" is invalid because it has N at position 4.

  Similarly, in our pattern, we cannot have N at position 4? Because we know N is at position 5? And also we know from first guess that N is not at position 4? So in the secret word, N is at position 5 and not at position 4? So we must avoid having N at position 4? 

  Therefore, in our candidates, we must not have N at position 4? 

  Now, in ""MORON"": 
      Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:R, 4:O, 5:N -> no N at position 4? Position 4 is O. So that's fine.

  In ""MOURN"":
      Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:N -> no N at position 4? Position 4 is R. So that's fine.

  So both are okay.

  Now, we need to choose one. Let's try to use a word that doesn't use a duplicate? ""MOURN"" has no duplicate letters, while ""MORON"" has duplicate O. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But they are allowed in Wordle? So both are possible.

  Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests more new letters? But we have to fill the pattern.

  Since we are at the third guess, and we have two possibilities, we might guess one of them.

  I think ""MOURN"" is more common? Or ""MORON""? 

  But let me see: we haven't tested U and M. We haven't tested O in a different position? But we know O is at position 2.

  We can guess ""MOURN"" to test U and M.

  If we guess ""MOURN"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on U and M? But if U is not in the word, then we know it must be ""MORON""? 

  Similarly, if we guess ""MORON"", and it's not the word, then we know it must be ""MOURN""? 

  So we can use this guess to distinguish.

  But we have only 6 tries, so we can afford to guess one of them.

  I'll choose ""MOURN"" because it has no duplicate letters and might be more common? Or let's see frequency.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that is not one of these but tests the letters? For example, a word that has M and also other letters that might be in the word? But we don't know.

  But we have to stick to the pattern: _ O _ _ N, with R at 3 or 4.

  Another candidate: ""DOURN""? Not a word.

  ""GOURD"" -> ends with D? Not N.

  ""POURS"" -> ends with S? Not N.

  So I think we have to choose between ""MOURN"" and ""MORON"".

  I'll go with ""MOURN"".

  So the third guess: ""MOURN""

  If it's not correct, then the word must be ""MORON"", and we can guess that next.

  But let's output ""MOURN"".

</think>
After analyzing the feedback:

- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R and N are in the word but not in positions 2 or 4.  
  - C, A, E are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: ROBIN**  
  Feedback: R(-), O(✓), B(x), I(x), N(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - O is in the word and **correctly placed at position 2**.  
  - N is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.  
  - R is in the word but not at position 1.  
  - B and I are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 2: **O**  
   - Position 5: **N**  
   So the word pattern is: `_ O _ _ N`.

2. **R must be at position 3 or 4**:  
   - From Guess 1, R is not at position 2.  
   - From Guess 2, R is not at position 1.  
   - Thus, R can only be at position 3 or 4.

3. **Excluded letters**: C, A, E, B, I (cannot appear anywhere).

4. **Possible words**:  
   - The word must fit `_ O _ _ N`, with R at position 3 or 4, and no excluded letters.  
   - After evaluating valid English words, two candidates emerge:  
     - **MOURN** (M O U R N): R at position 4.  
     - **MORON** (M O R O N): R at position 3.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **MOURN** is chosen to test:  
  - M (new letter) at position 1.  
  - U (new letter) at position 3.  
  - R at position 4 (plausible per insights).  
- If **MOURN** is incorrect, feedback will confirm if M or U are in the word, and we can pivot to **MORON** next.

<guess>mourn</guess>",mourn,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, wrong position) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 4
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""robin""
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> R is in the word, but not at position 1 (because we put it at position 1 in this guess and it's wrong)
  O: ✓ (correct position) -> so O is in the word and at position 2
  B: x (not in word)
  I: x (not in word)
  N: ✓ (correct position) -> so N is in the word and at position 5

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The word has O at position 2 and N at position 5. So the word is: _ O _ _ N

2. R is in the word, but it cannot be at position 2 (from first guess) and also cannot be at position 1 (from second guess). So R must be at position 3 or 4.

3. Letters that are not in the word: C, A, E, B, I (from the x's in both guesses)

4. We also know that from the first guess, N was not at position 4 (but now we know it's at position 5, so that's consistent).

Now, we need to find a word that fits: _ O _ _ N, with R in position 3 or 4, and without C, A, E, B, I.

Also, we have to consider that the word must be a 5-letter English word.

Let's list possible letters for the remaining positions:

Position 1: cannot be C, A, E, B, I, and also cannot be R? Wait, R is already in the word but we don't know where. But position 1: we don't have any constraint that forbids a letter we haven't tried? Actually, we haven't tried many letters. But we know R is in the word and must be at 3 or 4, so position 1 must be a letter that is not R? Because if R were at position 1, it would have been correct in the second guess? But in the second guess, we had R at position 1 and it was marked as wrong position? That means R is not at position 1. So position 1 cannot be R.

Similarly, position 3 and 4: one of them must be R, and the other is an unknown letter.

Also, position 3 and 4: cannot be any of the excluded letters: C, A, E, B, I.

So the word structure: 
  Position 1: any letter except C, A, E, B, I, and also not R (since R is not at position 1). Also, it must be a letter we haven't excluded.
  Position 2: O (fixed)
  Position 3: either R or another letter? But note: R must be in the word and can only be at 3 or 4. So if position 3 is R, then position 4 is another letter. If position 3 is not R, then position 4 must be R.
  Position 4: same as above.
  Position 5: N (fixed)

We also need to consider that the word must be valid.

Let's think of words that end with ""ON"" and have O at the second position.

Possible words:

Option 1: R at position 3: then the word is _ O R _ N

Option 2: R at position 4: then the word is _ O _ R N

Now, we need to fill the blanks.

First, for position 1: we can use letters that are not excluded. Excluded: C, A, E, B, I. So available: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and also common ones).

But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

Let's try to list words of the form _ O R _ N:

Examples: 
  ""CORN"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5. So 5-letter words: 
  ""HORNS"" -> but we have N at position 5? ""HORNS"" is H O R N S -> but then position 4 is N? But we have position 5 as N? No, that doesn't match. Our pattern is _ O R _ N, so the last letter is N, so the word must end with ""N"", so the fourth letter must be the one before the last. 

Actually, the pattern is: 
  position 1: ?
  position 2: O
  position 3: R
  position 4: ?
  position 5: N

So the word is ? O R ? N

What words are there? 
  ""TORN"" is 4 letters. 
  ""HORNS"" is H O R N S -> that's positions: H(1), O(2), R(3), N(4), S(5) -> but we need position 5 to be N? Here position 5 is S. So not.

  ""BORNS"" -> not a word? and B is excluded.

  ""CORNS"" -> C is excluded, and also it's C O R N S -> again, position 5 is S, not N.

  ""FORMS"" -> F O R M S -> not ending with N.

  We need the word to end with N? Yes, because position 5 is N.

  So the word must end with ""?N"", and the third letter is R? So the last two letters are the fourth letter and then N.

  Examples: 
    ""HORNS"" doesn't work because it ends with ""NS"", not ""?N"" with the fourth letter being the one we are looking for.

  Actually, the pattern is: ... R ? N -> so the last two are the fourth letter and then N. So the word ends with two letters: (letter at 4) and then N.

  So the word is: [letter1] O R [letter4] N

  What are some words? 
    ""WORN"" is 4 letters.
    ""TORN"" is 4 letters.

  How about ""PORTS"" -> but that ends with S? Not N.

  I'm struggling. Maybe there are no common words of the form ? O R ? N.

  Let me think: ""MOURN"" -> M O U R N? 
    Positions: 
      1: M
      2: O
      3: U
      4: R
      5: N

  But in this case, R is at position 4, not 3. So that's the other pattern.

  So let's try the other pattern: R at position 4: then the word is _ O _ R N

  So pattern: [1] O [3] R N

  Now, position 3 is not R? But we have R at position 4.

  So the word: ? O ? R N

  Examples:
    ""MOURN"": M O U R N -> matches: M(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), N(5) -> perfect.

  But we have to check the excluded letters: M, O, U, R, N. 
    M: not excluded? 
    U: not excluded? 
    O: is included and at position 2 (correct)
    R: at position 4 (we don't know if that's correct yet, but we know R is in the word and must be at 3 or 4, so 4 is possible)
    N: at position 5 (correct)

  Also, excluded letters: C, A, E, B, I. M and U are not in that list.

  So ""MOURN"" is a candidate.

  Other words?
    ""DOURN""? Not a word.
    ""GOURN""? Not a word.
    ""POURN""? Not a word.
    ""TOURN""? Not a word.
    ""HOURN""? Not a word.

  How about ""BORNE""? But B and E are excluded.

  ""FORUM""? Doesn't end with RN.

  ""HORDE""? Ends with E? But E is excluded.

  ""LORRY""? Doesn't end with N.

  ""MOURN"" seems a valid word.

  But wait, in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. In the second guess, we had R at position 1 and it was wrong. Now in ""MOURN"", R is at position 4. That's acceptable.

  Also, we have to check if there are other possibilities.

  Another word: ""TOURED""? 6 letters.

  ""YOURN""? Not a word.

  ""SOURN""? Not a word.

  ""DOUR"" is 4 letters.

  So ""MOURN"" is a strong candidate.

  But let me check if there are words with R at position 3? We had trouble, but maybe:

  ""FORM"" is 4 letters.

  ""WORM"" is 4.

  ""GORM"" is not 5.

  ""NORTH"" -> N O R T H -> but then position 1 is N? But we have N at position 5? And in this word, N is at position 1 and 5? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback, we have N at position 5 correct, and in the first guess N was at position 4 and wrong. But if the word has two N's? Then the feedback for the first guess would have shown one N as present? Actually, in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out that the word has two N's? But in the second guess, we have N at position 5 and it's correct. So if the word has two N's, then the first guess N at position 4 would be marked as present (which it was) and the second guess N at position 5 is correct. But in the word ""NORTH"", we have N at position 1 and position 5? No, ""NORTH"" is N O R T H -> only one N at position 1? Then position 5 is H? So that doesn't match our pattern because we need position 5 to be N.

  How about ""HORNS""? We already saw it doesn't end with N.

  Another idea: ""CORNY"" -> but C is excluded.

  ""SORRY"" -> two R's? And ends with Y? Not N.

  So it seems the only common word that fits the pattern is ""MOURN"".

  But wait, what about ""DOORN""? Not a word.

  Or ""POORI"" -> not ending with N.

  So I think ""MOURN"" is the best candidate.

  However, we must consider that we haven't tested M and U. But we have to make a guess.

  Alternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we have only 6 tries and we are at the third guess. And we have two letters fixed: O at 2 and N at 5, and R must be at 3 or 4. So if we guess ""MOURN"", we might get it right.

  But let me double-check the feedback we have:

  We know:
    O at 2, N at 5, R at 4 (if we guess ""MOURN"", then R is at 4) and we have M and U.

  But we don't have any information about M and U. However, if we guess ""MOURN"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on M and U.

  Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more common letters? But we have many letters excluded.

  Since we have only two positions to fill (position 1 and 3) and R must be at 3 or 4, but in our pattern for ""MOURN"", we have R at 4 and U at 3.

  Another possibility: what if R is at position 3? Then the word is ? O R ? N. We couldn't find a common word, but maybe there is one.

  Let me think: ""TORAN"" -> but A is excluded? And not a common word? Also, A is excluded.

  ""BORAX"" -> B and A excluded.

  ""GORGE"" -> E excluded.

  ""FORUM"" -> ends with M? Not N.

  ""YORKS"" -> ends with S? Not N.

  ""WORKS"" -> same.

  ""FORKY"" -> not a word.

  So I think ""MOURN"" is the most likely.

  But wait, there's ""PORTS"" but doesn't end with N.

  Another word: ""MORON"" -> M O R O N? 
    Positions: M(1), O(2), R(3), O(4), N(5)
    This has two O's? 
    Now, check: 
      Position 2: O (correct)
      Position 5: N (correct)
      R at position 3? That's allowed because R must be at 3 or 4.
      But we have O at position 4? Is that allowed? We don't have any feedback about O being duplicated? But the feedback for the second guess: O was at position 2 and correct. If the word has two O's, then in the second guess we only had one O? So we wouldn't know about the second O? 

  But in ""MORON"", we have O at position 2 and 4. In the second guess, we only tested O at position 2 and it was correct. We didn't test position 4. So it's possible.

  Now, check excluded letters: M, O, R, O, N. M, R, N are not excluded. O is allowed. But we have two O's? Is that allowed? The rules don't forbid duplicate letters.

  However, in the feedback for the first guess, we had only one R and one N? But the word might have duplicates.

  But in ""MORON"", we have two O's. We haven't tested O at position 4? So it's possible.

  Also, in the first guess, we had A and E which are excluded, but O is not excluded.

  So ""MORON"" is also a candidate.

  Now, we have two candidates: ""MOURN"" and ""MORON"".

  How to decide? We can choose one that tests more letters? 

  In ""MOURN"", we test M and U.
  In ""MORON"", we test M and O (again) and also we are testing if there is a duplicate O? But we already know O is in the word at position 2, so if we get feedback for ""MORON"", we might see if O is at position 4? 

  But we are at the third guess, and we have limited tries. We might want to guess the word if possible.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use M? Because we haven't tested M? But we have to use some letter.

  Another candidate: ""DOZEN"" -> but E is excluded? And D is not excluded? But we have O at 2 and N at 5? ""DOZEN"": D O Z E N -> E is excluded? So no.

  ""GOWN"" is 4 letters.

  ""SOUTH"" -> ends with H? Not N.

  ""FOUND"" -> ends with D? Not N.

  ""POUND"" -> same.

  So between ""MOURN"" and ""MORON"", which one?

  Let me see the frequency? Or we can choose one that doesn't use a duplicate if we are unsure about duplicates? But we don't have information.

  Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't use M? But we don't have many options.

  Another word: ""LOURN""? Not a word.

  ""TOURN""? Not a word.

  ""WOUND"" -> ends with D? Not N.

  ""HOUND"" -> same.

  ""ROUND"" -> R O U N D -> but then position 4 is N? And position 5 is D? But we need position 5 to be N? So no.

  So I think we have to choose between ""MOURN"" and ""MORON"".

  But note: in ""MORON"", we have O at position 4. We already know O is at position 2. If the word has two O's, that's fine. But we don't know.

  However, in the second guess, we had ""ROBIN"" and we got O at position 2 correct and N at position 5 correct. The other letters: R was present but wrong position (we had it at 1, but it's not at 1) and B and I were absent. 

  Now, if the word is ""MORON"", then the R would be at position 3? And we have O at 2 and 4, and N at 5. Then in the second guess, when we guessed ""ROBIN"", we had:
    R at 1: present but wrong position -> because in the secret word R is at 3? So that's consistent.
    O at 2: correct -> matches.
    B: absent -> correct because ""MORON"" has no B.
    I: absent -> correct.
    N at 5: correct.

  So ""MORON"" is consistent with the feedback.

  Similarly, ""MOURN"" is also consistent: 
    In ""ROBIN"": 
        R at 1: present but wrong position -> in ""MOURN"", R is at 4, so that's correct.
        O at 2: correct.
        B: absent -> correct.
        I: absent -> correct.
        N at 5: correct.

  So both are consistent.

  We need to break the tie.

  We can try to think of other words? 

  Another possibility: ""FORUM"" is not 5? It is 5, but ends with M? Not N.

  ""GORGE"" not.

  ""YORKS"" not.

  ""PORKS"" not.

  ""FORKY"" not.

  ""WORDY"" -> W O R D Y -> but then position 5 is Y? Not N.

  So we have two candidates.

  How about ""HORNY""? 
    H O R N Y -> 
      Position 1: H
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: R
      Position 4: N -> but we have N at position 5? And in this word, position 4 is N? But we know from the first guess that N is not at position 4? Because in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position? That means the secret word has N, but not at position 4. So if we put N at position 4 in a guess, it would be wrong? But in the secret word, if it were ""HORNY"", then N is at position 4? That would contradict the first guess feedback? 

  Let me check: 
    First guess: ""crane"" had N at position 4. If the secret word is ""HORNY"", then N is at position 4? Then the feedback for the first guess would have marked N as correct? But it was marked as present but wrong position? So that means N is not at position 4. Therefore, ""HORNY"" is invalid because it has N at position 4.

  Similarly, in our pattern, we cannot have N at position 4? Because we know N is at position 5? And also we know from first guess that N is not at position 4? So in the secret word, N is at position 5 and not at position 4? So we must avoid having N at position 4? 

  Therefore, in our candidates, we must not have N at position 4? 

  Now, in ""MORON"": 
      Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:R, 4:O, 5:N -> no N at position 4? Position 4 is O. So that's fine.

  In ""MOURN"":
      Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:N -> no N at position 4? Position 4 is R. So that's fine.

  So both are okay.

  Now, we need to choose one. Let's try to use a word that doesn't use a duplicate? ""MOURN"" has no duplicate letters, while ""MORON"" has duplicate O. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But they are allowed in Wordle? So both are possible.

  Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests more new letters? But we have to fill the pattern.

  Since we are at the third guess, and we have two possibilities, we might guess one of them.

  I think ""MOURN"" is more common? Or ""MORON""? 

  But let me see: we haven't tested U and M. We haven't tested O in a different position? But we know O is at position 2.

  We can guess ""MOURN"" to test U and M.

  If we guess ""MOURN"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on U and M? But if U is not in the word, then we know it must be ""MORON""? 

  Similarly, if we guess ""MORON"", and it's not the word, then we know it must be ""MOURN""? 

  So we can use this guess to distinguish.

  But we have only 6 tries, so we can afford to guess one of them.

  I'll choose ""MOURN"" because it has no duplicate letters and might be more common? Or let's see frequency.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that is not one of these but tests the letters? For example, a word that has M and also other letters that might be in the word? But we don't know.

  But we have to stick to the pattern: _ O _ _ N, with R at 3 or 4.

  Another candidate: ""DOURN""? Not a word.

  ""GOURD"" -> ends with D? Not N.

  ""POURS"" -> ends with S? Not N.

  So I think we have to choose between ""MOURN"" and ""MORON"".

  I'll go with ""MOURN"".

  So the third guess: ""MOURN""

  If it's not correct, then the word must be ""MORON"", and we can guess that next.

  But let's output ""MOURN"".

<guess>mourn</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R and N are in the word but not in positions 2 or 4.  
  - C, A, E are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: ROBIN**  
  Feedback: R(-), O(✓), B(x), I(x), N(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - O is in the word and **correctly placed at position 2**.  
  - N is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.  
  - R is in the word but not at position 1.  
  - B and I are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 2: **O**  
   - Position 5: **N**  
   So the word pattern is: `_ O _ _ N`.

2. **R must be at position 3 or 4**:  
   - From Guess 1, R is not at position 2.  
   - From Guess 2, R is not at position 1.  
   - Thus, R can only be at position 3 or 4.

3. **Excluded letters**: C, A, E, B, I (cannot appear anywhere).

4. **Possible words**:  
   - The word must fit `_ O _ _ N`, with R at position 3 or 4, and no excluded letters.  
   - After evaluating valid English words, two candidates emerge:  
     - **MOURN** (M O U R N): R at position 4.  
     - **MORON** (M O R O N): R at position 3.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **MOURN** is chosen to test:  
  - M (new letter) at position 1.  
  - U (new letter) at position 3.  
  - R at position 4 (plausible per insights).  
- If **MOURN** is incorrect, feedback will confirm if M or U are in the word, and we can pivot to **MORON** next.",Guess 3: mourn -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(✓) U(x) R(-) N(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,MORON,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, the secret word contains R and N, but not C, A, or E.
 R and N are in the word, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and N was in position 4.

 We know:
 - The word has 5 letters.
 - Contains R and N, but not C, A, E.
 - R cannot be in position 2, and N cannot be in position 4.

 Since A and E are vowels and are excluded, the word might have other vowels like I, O, U. Also, we have to consider consonants.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Does not contain C, A, E (because they are marked as not in the word).
 - Includes R and N (since we know they are in the word) but in different positions from guess 1 (so R not in position 2, N not in position 4).

 We can try to use other common letters and include R and N.

 Let's think of words that have R and N, and avoid C, A, E.

 Possible words: 
   - R at different positions: not position 2.
   - N at different positions: not position 4.

 Example: ""ROBIN"" -> but it has O and I which are vowels? But wait, ROBIN: R in position 1? But in our first guess, R was in position 2 and now position 1 is a candidate? Also, B and I are new.

 However, note that in ""crane"", position 2 was R and now it's wrong, so in the new word, R is not at position 2.

 Let me check some words:

 Alternative: Let's choose a word that has R and N, and other letters that are common and not excluded.

 Since we know that R and N are present, we might want to test other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants.

 Another idea: ""POINT"" -> but does it have R? No. We must include R.

 So, we need to include R and N.

 Let me try: ""PRINT"" -> P, R, I, N, T.
 But check positions: 
   In ""PRINT"":
     R is in position 2 -> but wait, in the secret word R cannot be in position 2? Because in our first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong position (meaning that it's not there, but present elsewhere). So, in the secret word R might be at 1,3,4, or 5. So having R at position 2 is not allowed? Actually, the feedback for R was (-) which means it's in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again.

 Therefore, in ""PRINT"", R is at position 2 again. That's not allowed because we know R is not at position 2? Actually, we can try but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we avoid position 2 for R.

 How about ""ROUND""? R is at position 1, which is allowed. Also, N is at position 4? Wait, in the first guess N was at position 4 and it was marked wrong position. So N cannot be at position 4 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback for N was (-) meaning N is in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 again? And similarly, R not at position 2.

 In ""ROUND"": 
   R is at 1 (good, because not position 2)
   N is at 4? That's the same position as the first guess, but we know N isn't at position 4? Actually, the secret word has N somewhere else. So placing N at position 4 again would be incorrect because we know that in the secret word N is not in position 4. Therefore, we must avoid putting N in position 4 in our next guess? Or can we? 

 Actually, we can, but it would give us information only if it turns out to be correct? However, we already know that it is not in that position, so it's better to try a different position.

 Therefore, let's avoid position 2 for R and position 4 for N.

 So, for second guess, we want:
 - R and N must be in positions other than 2 and 4 respectively.
 - Avoid C, A, E.

 Other possibilities: 
   - R in position 1,3,5 and N in position 1,2,3,5? But note: the word may have duplicate letters? Well, the rules don't say it can't, but usually Wordle words have distinct letters? Actually, the rules don't specify, so we should consider words with repeated letters as possible? However, the feedback doesn't indicate double letters explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if the secret word has two of the same letter and you guess one in the correct position and one missing, the feedback can be tricky. But in this case, we have no indication of double letters so far.

 Let me pick a word that has R and N, in new positions, and avoids the forbidden letters.

 Some ideas:
   Option 1: ""ROBIN"": 
        R at 1 (okay, not 2)
        O at 2
        B at 3
        I at 4
        N at 5? Wait, but in the first guess N was at 4 and now we put it at 5? That's okay because position 5 is new. 

        So: ROBIN -> has R (pos1), N (pos5) -> avoids R at 2 and N at 4.

   Option 2: ""GROIN"":
        G at 1
        R at 2 -> but wait, we cannot put R in position 2? Because we know R is not at position 2. So no.

   Option 3: ""HORNS"":
        H at 1
        O at 2
        R at 3 -> fine (because not 2)
        N at 4 -> but we know N is not at 4? So avoid.

   Option 4: ""WORN"" isn't 5 letters.

   Option 5: ""PRONG"":
        P at 1
        R at 2 -> not allowed (avoid position 2 for R)
        O at 3
        N at 4 -> avoid?
        G at 5

   So avoid that.

   Option 6: ""BORNS""? No, not a word? or ""borns"" is not a valid word.

   Option 7: ""RUNNY"" -> that has double N? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? And it's not standard Wordle? Actually, the rules didn't forbid it, but let's assume valid English words.

   However, we have to stick to valid English words.

   Let's try ""IRONY"":
        I at 1
        R at 2 -> avoid? position 2 again? So no.

   Option 8: ""TRUNK"": 
        T at 1
        R at 2 -> avoid.

   Option 9: ""KRONA"" -> but A is excluded? No, because we cannot use A.

   How about ""CROWN"" -> but C is excluded? We cannot use C.

   Another: ""PROUD"": 
        P at 1
        R at 2 -> avoid.

   How about ""ROWDY"": 
        R at 1 (ok)
        O at 2
        W at 3
        D at 4
        Y at 5 -> but no N? We need to include N because we know it's in the word.

   Therefore, let's look for words with R and N, and without C, A, E.

   We want R not in position 2 and N not in position 4.

   Example: ""RONIN"" -> but that is a word? And would have R at 1, N at 5? Wait: R O N I N? That has two N's? And positions: 
        R at 1 (ok)
        O at 2
        N at 3 -> then I at 4 and N at 5? Actually, ""ronin"" is R O N I N, so N at 3 and 5. Then position 3 is new, position 5 is new? So not at position 4? That might be acceptable.

   But we are avoiding C, A, E, and using R, O, N, I.

   Alternatively, ""ROBIN"" seems a good choice: 
        R (1), O (2), B (3), I (4), N (5) -> positions: 
          R: position 1 (good, not 2)
          N: position 5 (good, not 4)

   Also, ""ROBIN"" is a valid English word.

   Therefore, I will guess ""ROBIN"".

   But note: we are also testing O and B and I. 

   Let me see if there are other options: ""URN"" but 3 letters? Not 5.

   Or ""BRINY"": 
        B at 1
        R at 2 -> avoid? because R was at position 2 and we know that's not correct? So we should avoid position 2.

   Therefore, ""ROBIN"" is a good candidate.

   However, what about ""ROYAL""? But A is excluded, and also no N? So no.

   So, second guess: ""ROBIN""

 Let's output that.

<guess>robin</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and E are not in the word (marked with x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with -).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (marked with -).

For the next guess:
1. Must include R and N, but avoid placing R in position 2 or N in position 4.
2. Cannot contain C, A, or E.
3. Should test new common letters like O, B, and I.

I chose ""ROBIN"" because:
- R is in position 1 (a new position for R, avoiding position 2).
- N is in position 5 (a new position for N, avoiding position 4).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, E).
- It introduces new vowels (O, I) and consonant (B) to gather more feedback.

<guess>robin</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: robin -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) B(x) I(x) N(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, wrong position) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 4
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""robin""
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> R is in the word, but not at position 1 (because we put it at position 1 in this guess and it's wrong)
  O: ✓ (correct position) -> so O is in the word and at position 2
  B: x (not in word)
  I: x (not in word)
  N: ✓ (correct position) -> so N is in the word and at position 5

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The word has O at position 2 and N at position 5. So the word is: _ O _ _ N

2. R is in the word, but it cannot be at position 2 (from first guess) and also cannot be at position 1 (from second guess). So R must be at position 3 or 4.

3. Letters that are not in the word: C, A, E, B, I (from the x's in both guesses)

4. We also know that from the first guess, N was not at position 4 (but now we know it's at position 5, so that's consistent).

Now, we need to find a word that fits: _ O _ _ N, with R in position 3 or 4, and without C, A, E, B, I.

Also, we have to consider that the word must be a 5-letter English word.

Let's list possible letters for the remaining positions:

Position 1: cannot be C, A, E, B, I, and also cannot be R? Wait, R is already in the word but we don't know where. But position 1: we don't have any constraint that forbids a letter we haven't tried? Actually, we haven't tried many letters. But we know R is in the word and must be at 3 or 4, so position 1 must be a letter that is not R? Because if R were at position 1, it would have been correct in the second guess? But in the second guess, we had R at position 1 and it was marked as wrong position? That means R is not at position 1. So position 1 cannot be R.

Similarly, position 3 and 4: one of them must be R, and the other is an unknown letter.

Also, position 3 and 4: cannot be any of the excluded letters: C, A, E, B, I.

So the word structure: 
  Position 1: any letter except C, A, E, B, I, and also not R (since R is not at position 1). Also, it must be a letter we haven't excluded.
  Position 2: O (fixed)
  Position 3: either R or another letter? But note: R must be in the word and can only be at 3 or 4. So if position 3 is R, then position 4 is another letter. If position 3 is not R, then position 4 must be R.
  Position 4: same as above.
  Position 5: N (fixed)

We also need to consider that the word must be valid.

Let's think of words that end with ""ON"" and have O at the second position.

Possible words:

Option 1: R at position 3: then the word is _ O R _ N

Option 2: R at position 4: then the word is _ O _ R N

Now, we need to fill the blanks.

First, for position 1: we can use letters that are not excluded. Excluded: C, A, E, B, I. So available: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and also common ones).

But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

Let's try to list words of the form _ O R _ N:

Examples: 
  ""CORN"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5. So 5-letter words: 
  ""HORNS"" -> but we have N at position 5? ""HORNS"" is H O R N S -> but then position 4 is N? But we have position 5 as N? No, that doesn't match. Our pattern is _ O R _ N, so the last letter is N, so the word must end with ""N"", so the fourth letter must be the one before the last. 

Actually, the pattern is: 
  position 1: ?
  position 2: O
  position 3: R
  position 4: ?
  position 5: N

So the word is ? O R ? N

What words are there? 
  ""TORN"" is 4 letters. 
  ""HORNS"" is H O R N S -> that's positions: H(1), O(2), R(3), N(4), S(5) -> but we need position 5 to be N? Here position 5 is S. So not.

  ""BORNS"" -> not a word? and B is excluded.

  ""CORNS"" -> C is excluded, and also it's C O R N S -> again, position 5 is S, not N.

  ""FORMS"" -> F O R M S -> not ending with N.

  We need the word to end with N? Yes, because position 5 is N.

  So the word must end with ""?N"", and the third letter is R? So the last two letters are the fourth letter and then N.

  Examples: 
    ""HORNS"" doesn't work because it ends with ""NS"", not ""?N"" with the fourth letter being the one we are looking for.

  Actually, the pattern is: ... R ? N -> so the last two are the fourth letter and then N. So the word ends with two letters: (letter at 4) and then N.

  So the word is: [letter1] O R [letter4] N

  What are some words? 
    ""WORN"" is 4 letters.
    ""TORN"" is 4 letters.

  How about ""PORTS"" -> but that ends with S? Not N.

  I'm struggling. Maybe there are no common words of the form ? O R ? N.

  Let me think: ""MOURN"" -> M O U R N? 
    Positions: 
      1: M
      2: O
      3: U
      4: R
      5: N

  But in this case, R is at position 4, not 3. So that's the other pattern.

  So let's try the other pattern: R at position 4: then the word is _ O _ R N

  So pattern: [1] O [3] R N

  Now, position 3 is not R? But we have R at position 4.

  So the word: ? O ? R N

  Examples:
    ""MOURN"": M O U R N -> matches: M(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), N(5) -> perfect.

  But we have to check the excluded letters: M, O, U, R, N. 
    M: not excluded? 
    U: not excluded? 
    O: is included and at position 2 (correct)
    R: at position 4 (we don't know if that's correct yet, but we know R is in the word and must be at 3 or 4, so 4 is possible)
    N: at position 5 (correct)

  Also, excluded letters: C, A, E, B, I. M and U are not in that list.

  So ""MOURN"" is a candidate.

  Other words?
    ""DOURN""? Not a word.
    ""GOURN""? Not a word.
    ""POURN""? Not a word.
    ""TOURN""? Not a word.
    ""HOURN""? Not a word.

  How about ""BORNE""? But B and E are excluded.

  ""FORUM""? Doesn't end with RN.

  ""HORDE""? Ends with E? But E is excluded.

  ""LORRY""? Doesn't end with N.

  ""MOURN"" seems a valid word.

  But wait, in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. In the second guess, we had R at position 1 and it was wrong. Now in ""MOURN"", R is at position 4. That's acceptable.

  Also, we have to check if there are other possibilities.

  Another word: ""TOURED""? 6 letters.

  ""YOURN""? Not a word.

  ""SOURN""? Not a word.

  ""DOUR"" is 4 letters.

  So ""MOURN"" is a strong candidate.

  But let me check if there are words with R at position 3? We had trouble, but maybe:

  ""FORM"" is 4 letters.

  ""WORM"" is 4.

  ""GORM"" is not 5.

  ""NORTH"" -> N O R T H -> but then position 1 is N? But we have N at position 5? And in this word, N is at position 1 and 5? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback, we have N at position 5 correct, and in the first guess N was at position 4 and wrong. But if the word has two N's? Then the feedback for the first guess would have shown one N as present? Actually, in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out that the word has two N's? But in the second guess, we have N at position 5 and it's correct. So if the word has two N's, then the first guess N at position 4 would be marked as present (which it was) and the second guess N at position 5 is correct. But in the word ""NORTH"", we have N at position 1 and position 5? No, ""NORTH"" is N O R T H -> only one N at position 1? Then position 5 is H? So that doesn't match our pattern because we need position 5 to be N.

  How about ""HORNS""? We already saw it doesn't end with N.

  Another idea: ""CORNY"" -> but C is excluded.

  ""SORRY"" -> two R's? And ends with Y? Not N.

  So it seems the only common word that fits the pattern is ""MOURN"".

  But wait, what about ""DOORN""? Not a word.

  Or ""POORI"" -> not ending with N.

  So I think ""MOURN"" is the best candidate.

  However, we must consider that we haven't tested M and U. But we have to make a guess.

  Alternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we have only 6 tries and we are at the third guess. And we have two letters fixed: O at 2 and N at 5, and R must be at 3 or 4. So if we guess ""MOURN"", we might get it right.

  But let me double-check the feedback we have:

  We know:
    O at 2, N at 5, R at 4 (if we guess ""MOURN"", then R is at 4) and we have M and U.

  But we don't have any information about M and U. However, if we guess ""MOURN"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on M and U.

  Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more common letters? But we have many letters excluded.

  Since we have only two positions to fill (position 1 and 3) and R must be at 3 or 4, but in our pattern for ""MOURN"", we have R at 4 and U at 3.

  Another possibility: what if R is at position 3? Then the word is ? O R ? N. We couldn't find a common word, but maybe there is one.

  Let me think: ""TORAN"" -> but A is excluded? And not a common word? Also, A is excluded.

  ""BORAX"" -> B and A excluded.

  ""GORGE"" -> E excluded.

  ""FORUM"" -> ends with M? Not N.

  ""YORKS"" -> ends with S? Not N.

  ""WORKS"" -> same.

  ""FORKY"" -> not a word.

  So I think ""MOURN"" is the most likely.

  But wait, there's ""PORTS"" but doesn't end with N.

  Another word: ""MORON"" -> M O R O N? 
    Positions: M(1), O(2), R(3), O(4), N(5)
    This has two O's? 
    Now, check: 
      Position 2: O (correct)
      Position 5: N (correct)
      R at position 3? That's allowed because R must be at 3 or 4.
      But we have O at position 4? Is that allowed? We don't have any feedback about O being duplicated? But the feedback for the second guess: O was at position 2 and correct. If the word has two O's, then in the second guess we only had one O? So we wouldn't know about the second O? 

  But in ""MORON"", we have O at position 2 and 4. In the second guess, we only tested O at position 2 and it was correct. We didn't test position 4. So it's possible.

  Now, check excluded letters: M, O, R, O, N. M, R, N are not excluded. O is allowed. But we have two O's? Is that allowed? The rules don't forbid duplicate letters.

  However, in the feedback for the first guess, we had only one R and one N? But the word might have duplicates.

  But in ""MORON"", we have two O's. We haven't tested O at position 4? So it's possible.

  Also, in the first guess, we had A and E which are excluded, but O is not excluded.

  So ""MORON"" is also a candidate.

  Now, we have two candidates: ""MOURN"" and ""MORON"".

  How to decide? We can choose one that tests more letters? 

  In ""MOURN"", we test M and U.
  In ""MORON"", we test M and O (again) and also we are testing if there is a duplicate O? But we already know O is in the word at position 2, so if we get feedback for ""MORON"", we might see if O is at position 4? 

  But we are at the third guess, and we have limited tries. We might want to guess the word if possible.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use M? Because we haven't tested M? But we have to use some letter.

  Another candidate: ""DOZEN"" -> but E is excluded? And D is not excluded? But we have O at 2 and N at 5? ""DOZEN"": D O Z E N -> E is excluded? So no.

  ""GOWN"" is 4 letters.

  ""SOUTH"" -> ends with H? Not N.

  ""FOUND"" -> ends with D? Not N.

  ""POUND"" -> same.

  So between ""MOURN"" and ""MORON"", which one?

  Let me see the frequency? Or we can choose one that doesn't use a duplicate if we are unsure about duplicates? But we don't have information.

  Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't use M? But we don't have many options.

  Another word: ""LOURN""? Not a word.

  ""TOURN""? Not a word.

  ""WOUND"" -> ends with D? Not N.

  ""HOUND"" -> same.

  ""ROUND"" -> R O U N D -> but then position 4 is N? And position 5 is D? But we need position 5 to be N? So no.

  So I think we have to choose between ""MOURN"" and ""MORON"".

  But note: in ""MORON"", we have O at position 4. We already know O is at position 2. If the word has two O's, that's fine. But we don't know.

  However, in the second guess, we had ""ROBIN"" and we got O at position 2 correct and N at position 5 correct. The other letters: R was present but wrong position (we had it at 1, but it's not at 1) and B and I were absent. 

  Now, if the word is ""MORON"", then the R would be at position 3? And we have O at 2 and 4, and N at 5. Then in the second guess, when we guessed ""ROBIN"", we had:
    R at 1: present but wrong position -> because in the secret word R is at 3? So that's consistent.
    O at 2: correct -> matches.
    B: absent -> correct because ""MORON"" has no B.
    I: absent -> correct.
    N at 5: correct.

  So ""MORON"" is consistent with the feedback.

  Similarly, ""MOURN"" is also consistent: 
    In ""ROBIN"": 
        R at 1: present but wrong position -> in ""MOURN"", R is at 4, so that's correct.
        O at 2: correct.
        B: absent -> correct.
        I: absent -> correct.
        N at 5: correct.

  So both are consistent.

  We need to break the tie.

  We can try to think of other words? 

  Another possibility: ""FORUM"" is not 5? It is 5, but ends with M? Not N.

  ""GORGE"" not.

  ""YORKS"" not.

  ""PORKS"" not.

  ""FORKY"" not.

  ""WORDY"" -> W O R D Y -> but then position 5 is Y? Not N.

  So we have two candidates.

  How about ""HORNY""? 
    H O R N Y -> 
      Position 1: H
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: R
      Position 4: N -> but we have N at position 5? And in this word, position 4 is N? But we know from the first guess that N is not at position 4? Because in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position? That means the secret word has N, but not at position 4. So if we put N at position 4 in a guess, it would be wrong? But in the secret word, if it were ""HORNY"", then N is at position 4? That would contradict the first guess feedback? 

  Let me check: 
    First guess: ""crane"" had N at position 4. If the secret word is ""HORNY"", then N is at position 4? Then the feedback for the first guess would have marked N as correct? But it was marked as present but wrong position? So that means N is not at position 4. Therefore, ""HORNY"" is invalid because it has N at position 4.

  Similarly, in our pattern, we cannot have N at position 4? Because we know N is at position 5? And also we know from first guess that N is not at position 4? So in the secret word, N is at position 5 and not at position 4? So we must avoid having N at position 4? 

  Therefore, in our candidates, we must not have N at position 4? 

  Now, in ""MORON"": 
      Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:R, 4:O, 5:N -> no N at position 4? Position 4 is O. So that's fine.

  In ""MOURN"":
      Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:N -> no N at position 4? Position 4 is R. So that's fine.

  So both are okay.

  Now, we need to choose one. Let's try to use a word that doesn't use a duplicate? ""MOURN"" has no duplicate letters, while ""MORON"" has duplicate O. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But they are allowed in Wordle? So both are possible.

  Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests more new letters? But we have to fill the pattern.

  Since we are at the third guess, and we have two possibilities, we might guess one of them.

  I think ""MOURN"" is more common? Or ""MORON""? 

  But let me see: we haven't tested U and M. We haven't tested O in a different position? But we know O is at position 2.

  We can guess ""MOURN"" to test U and M.

  If we guess ""MOURN"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on U and M? But if U is not in the word, then we know it must be ""MORON""? 

  Similarly, if we guess ""MORON"", and it's not the word, then we know it must be ""MOURN""? 

  So we can use this guess to distinguish.

  But we have only 6 tries, so we can afford to guess one of them.

  I'll choose ""MOURN"" because it has no duplicate letters and might be more common? Or let's see frequency.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that is not one of these but tests the letters? For example, a word that has M and also other letters that might be in the word? But we don't know.

  But we have to stick to the pattern: _ O _ _ N, with R at 3 or 4.

  Another candidate: ""DOURN""? Not a word.

  ""GOURD"" -> ends with D? Not N.

  ""POURS"" -> ends with S? Not N.

  So I think we have to choose between ""MOURN"" and ""MORON"".

  I'll go with ""MOURN"".

  So the third guess: ""MOURN""

  If it's not correct, then the word must be ""MORON"", and we can guess that next.

  But let's output ""MOURN"".

<guess>mourn</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R and N are in the word but not in positions 2 or 4.  
  - C, A, E are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: ROBIN**  
  Feedback: R(-), O(✓), B(x), I(x), N(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - O is in the word and **correctly placed at position 2**.  
  - N is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.  
  - R is in the word but not at position 1.  
  - B and I are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 2: **O**  
   - Position 5: **N**  
   So the word pattern is: `_ O _ _ N`.

2. **R must be at position 3 or 4**:  
   - From Guess 1, R is not at position 2.  
   - From Guess 2, R is not at position 1.  
   - Thus, R can only be at position 3 or 4.

3. **Excluded letters**: C, A, E, B, I (cannot appear anywhere).

4. **Possible words**:  
   - The word must fit `_ O _ _ N`, with R at position 3 or 4, and no excluded letters.  
   - After evaluating valid English words, two candidates emerge:  
     - **MOURN** (M O U R N): R at position 4.  
     - **MORON** (M O R O N): R at position 3.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **MOURN** is chosen to test:  
  - M (new letter) at position 1.  
  - U (new letter) at position 3.  
  - R at position 4 (plausible per insights).  
- If **MOURN** is incorrect, feedback will confirm if M or U are in the word, and we can pivot to **MORON** next.

No. We must include R.\n\n So, we need to include R and N.\n\n Let me try: ""PRINT"" -> P, R, I, N, T.\n But check positions: \n   In ""PRINT"":\n     R is in position 2 -> but wait, in the secret word R cannot be in position 2? Because in our first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong position (meaning that it\'s not there, but present elsewhere). So, in the secret word R might be at 1,3,4, or 5. So having R at position 2 is not allowed? Actually, the feedback for R was (-) which means it\'s in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again.\n\n Therefore, in ""PRINT"", R is at position 2 again. That\'s not allowed because we know R is not at position 2? Actually, we can try but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there. So we avoid position 2 for R.\n\n How about ""ROUND""? R is at position 1, which is allowed. Also, N is at position 4? Wait, in the first guess N was at position 4 and it was marked wrong position. So N cannot be at position 4 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback for N was (-) meaning N is in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 again? And similarly, R not at position 2.\n\n In ""ROUND"": \n   R is at 1 (good, because not position 2)\n   N is at 4? That\'s the same position as the first guess, but we know N isn\'t at position 4? Actually, the secret word has N somewhere else. So placing N at position 4 again would be incorrect because we know that in the secret word N is not in position 4. Therefore, we must avoid putting N in position 4 in our next guess? Or can we? \n\n Actually, we can, but it would give us information only if it turns out to be correct? However, we already know that it is not in that position, so it\'s better to try a different position.\n\n Therefore, let\'s avoid position 2 for R and position 4 for N.\n\n So, for second guess, we want:\n - R and N must be in positions other than 2 and 4 respectively.\n - Avoid C, A, E.\n\n Other possibilities: \n   - R in position 1,3,5 and N in position 1,2,3,5? But note: the word may have duplicate letters? Well, the rules don\'t say it can\'t, but usually Wordle words have distinct letters? Actually, the rules don\'t specify, so we should consider words with repeated letters as possible? However, the feedback doesn\'t indicate double letters explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if the secret word has two of the same letter and you guess one in the correct position and one missing, the feedback can be tricky. But in this case, we have no indication of double letters so far.\n\n Let me pick a word that has R and N, in new positions, and avoids the forbidden letters.\n\n Some ideas:\n   Option 1: ""ROBIN"": \n        R at 1 (okay, not 2)\n        O at 2\n        B at 3\n        I at 4\n        N at 5? Wait, but in the first guess N was at 4 and now we put it at 5? That\'s okay because position 5 is new. \n\n        So: ROBIN -> has R (pos1), N (pos5) -> avoids R at 2 and N at 4.\n\n   Option 2: ""GROIN"":\n        G at 1\n        R at 2 -> but wait, we cannot put R in position 2? Because we know R is not at position 2. So no.\n\n   Option 3: ""HORNS"":\n        H at 1\n        O at 2\n        R at 3 -> fine (because not 2)\n        N at 4 -> but we know N is not at 4? So avoid.\n\n   Option 4: ""WORN"" isn\'t 5 letters.\n\n   Option 5: ""PRONG"":\n        P at 1\n        R at 2 -> not allowed (avoid position 2 for R)\n        O at 3\n        N at 4 -> avoid?\n        G at 5\n\n   So avoid that.\n\n   Option 6: ""BORNS""? No, not a word? or ""borns"" is not a valid word.\n\n   Option 7: ""RUNNY"" -> that has double N? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? And it\'s not standard Wordle? Actually, the rules didn\'t forbid it, but let\'s assume valid English words.\n\n   However, we have to stick to valid English words.\n\n   Let\'s try ""IRONY"":\n        I at 1\n        R at 2 -> avoid? position 2 again? So no.\n\n   Option 8: ""TRUNK"": \n        T at 1\n        R at 2 -> avoid.\n\n   Option 9: ""KRONA"" -> but A is excluded? No, because we cannot use A.\n\n   How about ""CROWN"" -> but C is excluded? We cannot use C.\n\n   Another: ""PROUD"": \n        P at 1\n        R at 2 -> avoid.\n\n   How about ""ROWDY"": \n        R at 1 (ok)\n        O at 2\n        W at 3\n        D at 4\n        Y at 5 -> but no N? We need to include N because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n   Therefore, let\'s look for words with R and N, and without C, A, E.\n\n   We want R not in position 2 and N not in position 4.\n\n   Example: ""RONIN"" -> but that is a word? And would have R at 1, N at 5? Wait: R O N I N? That has two N\'s? And positions: \n        R at 1 (ok)\n        O at 2\n        N at 3 -> then I at 4 and N at 5? Actually, ""ronin"" is R O N I N, so N at 3 and 5. Then position 3 is new, position 5 is new? So not at position 4? That might be acceptable.\n\n   But we are avoiding C, A, E, and using R, O, N, I.\n\n   Alternatively, ""ROBIN"" seems a good choice: \n        R (1), O (2), B (3), I (4), N (5) -> positions: \n          R: position 1 (good, not 2)\n          N: position 5 (good, not 4)\n\n   Also, ""ROBIN"" is a valid English word.\n\n   Therefore, I will guess ""ROBIN"".\n\n   But note: we are also testing O and B and I. \n\n   Let me see if there are other options: ""URN"" but 3 letters? Not 5.\n\n   Or ""BRINY"": \n        B at 1\n        R at 2 -> avoid? because R was at position 2 and we know that\'s not correct? So we should avoid position 2.\n\n   Therefore, ""ROBIN"" is a good candidate.\n\n   However, what about ""ROYAL""? But A is excluded, and also no N? So no.\n\n   So, second guess: ""ROBIN""\n\n Let\'s output that.\n\n<guess>robin</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and E are not in the word (marked with x).\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with -).\n- N is in the word but not in position 4 (marked with -).\n\nFor the next guess:\n1. Must include R and N, but avoid placing R in position 2 or N in position 4.\n2. Cannot contain C, A, or E.\n3. Should test new common letters like O, B, and I.\n\nI chose ""ROBIN"" because:\n- R is in position 1 (a new position for R, avoiding position 2).\n- N is in position 5 (a new position for N, avoiding position 4).\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, E).\n- It introduces new vowels (O, I) and consonant (B) to gather more feedback.\n\n<guess>robin</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: robin -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) B(x) I(x) N(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2\n  A: x (not in word)\n  N: - (in word, wrong position) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 4\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""robin""\n  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> R is in the word, but not at position 1 (because we put it at position 1 in this guess and it\'s wrong)\n  O: ✓ (correct position) -> so O is in the word and at position 2\n  B: x (not in word)\n  I: x (not in word)\n  N: ✓ (correct position) -> so N is in the word and at position 5\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. The word has O at position 2 and N at position 5. So the word is: _ O _ _ N\n\n2. R is in the word, but it cannot be at position 2 (from first guess) and also cannot be at position 1 (from second guess). So R must be at position 3 or 4.\n\n3. Letters that are not in the word: C, A, E, B, I (from the x\'s in both guesses)\n\n4. We also know that from the first guess, N was not at position 4 (but now we know it\'s at position 5, so that\'s consistent).\n\nNow, we need to find a word that fits: _ O _ _ N, with R in position 3 or 4, and without C, A, E, B, I.\n\nAlso, we have to consider that the word must be a 5-letter English word.\n\nLet\'s list possible letters for the remaining positions:\n\nPosition 1: cannot be C, A, E, B, I, and also cannot be R? Wait, R is already in the word but we don\'t know where. But position 1: we don\'t have any constraint that forbids a letter we haven\'t tried? Actually, we haven\'t tried many letters. But we know R is in the word and must be at 3 or 4, so position 1 must be a letter that is not R? Because if R were at position 1, it would have been correct in the second guess? But in the second guess, we had R at position 1 and it was marked as wrong position? That means R is not at position 1. So position 1 cannot be R.\n\nSimilarly, position 3 and 4: one of them must be R, and the other is an unknown letter.\n\nAlso, position 3 and 4: cannot be any of the excluded letters: C, A, E, B, I.\n\nSo the word structure: \n  Position 1: any letter except C, A, E, B, I, and also not R (since R is not at position 1). Also, it must be a letter we haven\'t excluded.\n  Position 2: O (fixed)\n  Position 3: either R or another letter? But note: R must be in the word and can only be at 3 or 4. So if position 3 is R, then position 4 is another letter. If position 3 is not R, then position 4 must be R.\n  Position 4: same as above.\n  Position 5: N (fixed)\n\nWe also need to consider that the word must be valid.\n\nLet\'s think of words that end with ""ON"" and have O at the second position.\n\nPossible words:\n\nOption 1: R at position 3: then the word is _ O R _ N\n\nOption 2: R at position 4: then the word is _ O _ R N\n\nNow, we need to fill the blanks.\n\nFirst, for position 1: we can use letters that are not excluded. Excluded: C, A, E, B, I. So available: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and also common ones).\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word must be valid.\n\nLet\'s try to list words of the form _ O R _ N:\n\nExamples: \n  ""CORN"" -> but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5. So 5-letter words: \n  ""HORNS"" -> but we have N at position 5? ""HORNS"" is H O R N S -> but then position 4 is N? But we have position 5 as N? No, that doesn\'t match. Our pattern is _ O R _ N, so the last letter is N, so the word must end with ""N"", so the fourth letter must be the one before the last. \n\nActually, the pattern is: \n  position 1: ?\n  position 2: O\n  position 3: R\n  position 4: ?\n  position 5: N\n\nSo the word is ? O R ? N\n\nWhat words are there? \n  ""TORN"" is 4 letters. \n  ""HORNS"" is H O R N S -> that\'s positions: H(1), O(2), R(3), N(4), S(5) -> but we need position 5 to be N? Here position 5 is S. So not.\n\n  ""BORNS"" -> not a word? and B is excluded.\n\n  ""CORNS"" -> C is excluded, and also it\'s C O R N S -> again, position 5 is S, not N.\n\n  ""FORMS"" -> F O R M S -> not ending with N.\n\n  We need the word to end with N? Yes, because position 5 is N.\n\n  So the word must end with ""?N"", and the third letter is R? So the last two letters are the fourth letter and then N.\n\n  Examples: \n    ""HORNS"" doesn\'t work because it ends with ""NS"", not ""?N"" with the fourth letter being the one we are looking for.\n\n  Actually, the pattern is: ... R ? N -> so the last two are the fourth letter and then N. So the word ends with two letters: (letter at 4) and then N.\n\n  So the word is: [letter1] O R [letter4] N\n\n  What are some words? \n    ""WORN"" is 4 letters.\n    ""TORN"" is 4 letters.\n\n  How about ""PORTS"" -> but that ends with S? Not N.\n\n  I\'m struggling. Maybe there are no common words of the form ? O R ? N.\n\n  Let me think: ""MOURN"" -> M O U R N? \n    Positions: \n      1: M\n      2: O\n      3: U\n      4: R\n      5: N\n\n  But in this case, R is at position 4, not 3. So that\'s the other pattern.\n\n  So let\'s try the other pattern: R at position 4: then the word is _ O _ R N\n\n  So pattern: [1] O [3] R N\n\n  Now, position 3 is not R? But we have R at position 4.\n\n  So the word: ? O ? R N\n\n  Examples:\n    ""MOURN"": M O U R N -> matches: M(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), N(5) -> perfect.\n\n  But we have to check the excluded letters: M, O, U, R, N. \n    M: not excluded? \n    U: not excluded? \n    O: is included and at position 2 (correct)\n    R: at position 4 (we don\'t know if that\'s correct yet, but we know R is in the word and must be at 3 or 4, so 4 is possible)\n    N: at position 5 (correct)\n\n  Also, excluded letters: C, A, E, B, I. M and U are not in that list.\n\n  So ""MOURN"" is a candidate.\n\n  Other words?\n    ""DOURN""? Not a word.\n    ""GOURN""? Not a word.\n    ""POURN""? Not a word.\n    ""TOURN""? Not a word.\n    ""HOURN""? Not a word.\n\n  How about ""BORNE""? But B and E are excluded.\n\n  ""FORUM""? Doesn\'t end with RN.\n\n  ""HORDE""? Ends with E? But E is excluded.\n\n  ""LORRY""? Doesn\'t end with N.\n\n  ""MOURN"" seems a valid word.\n\n  But wait, in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. In the second guess, we had R at position 1 and it was wrong. Now in ""MOURN"", R is at position 4. That\'s acceptable.\n\n  Also, we have to check if there are other possibilities.\n\n  Another word: ""TOURED""? 6 letters.\n\n  ""YOURN""? Not a word.\n\n  ""SOURN""? Not a word.\n\n  ""DOUR"" is 4 letters.\n\n  So ""MOURN"" is a strong candidate.\n\n  But let me check if there are words with R at position 3? We had trouble, but maybe:\n\n  ""FORM"" is 4 letters.\n\n  ""WORM"" is 4.\n\n  ""GORM"" is not 5.\n\n  ""NORTH"" -> N O R T H -> but then position 1 is N? But we have N at position 5? And in this word, N is at position 1 and 5? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback, we have N at position 5 correct, and in the first guess N was at position 4 and wrong. But if the word has two N\'s? Then the feedback for the first guess would have shown one N as present? Actually, in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn\'t rule out that the word has two N\'s? But in the second guess, we have N at position 5 and it\'s correct. So if the word has two N\'s, then the first guess N at position 4 would be marked as present (which it was) and the second guess N at position 5 is correct. But in the word ""NORTH"", we have N at position 1 and position 5? No, ""NORTH"" is N O R T H -> only one N at position 1? Then position 5 is H? So that doesn\'t match our pattern because we need position 5 to be N.\n\n  How about ""HORNS""? We already saw it doesn\'t end with N.\n\n  Another idea: ""CORNY"" -> but C is excluded.\n\n  ""SORRY"" -> two R\'s? And ends with Y? Not N.\n\n  So it seems the only common word that fits the pattern is ""MOURN"".\n\n  But wait, what about ""DOORN""? Not a word.\n\n  Or ""POORI"" -> not ending with N.\n\n  So I think ""MOURN"" is the best candidate.\n\n  However, we must consider that we haven\'t tested M and U. But we have to make a guess.\n\n  Alternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we have only 6 tries and we are at the third guess. And we have two letters fixed: O at 2 and N at 5, and R must be at 3 or 4. So if we guess ""MOURN"", we might get it right.\n\n  But let me double-check the feedback we have:\n\n  We know:\n    O at 2, N at 5, R at 4 (if we guess ""MOURN"", then R is at 4) and we have M and U.\n\n  But we don\'t have any information about M and U. However, if we guess ""MOURN"", and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on M and U.\n\n  Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more common letters? But we have many letters excluded.\n\n  Since we have only two positions to fill (position 1 and 3) and R must be at 3 or 4, but in our pattern for ""MOURN"", we have R at 4 and U at 3.\n\n  Another possibility: what if R is at position 3? Then the word is ? O R ? N. We couldn\'t find a common word, but maybe there is one.\n\n  Let me think: ""TORAN"" -> but A is excluded? And not a common word? Also, A is excluded.\n\n  ""BORAX"" -> B and A excluded.\n\n  ""GORGE"" -> E excluded.\n\n  ""FORUM"" -> ends with M? Not N.\n\n  ""YORKS"" -> ends with S? Not N.\n\n  ""WORKS"" -> same.\n\n  ""FORKY"" -> not a word.\n\n  So I think ""MOURN"" is the most likely.\n\n  But wait, there\'s ""PORTS"" but doesn\'t end with N.\n\n  Another word: ""MORON"" -> M O R O N? \n    Positions: M(1), O(2), R(3), O(4), N(5)\n    This has two O\'s? \n    Now, check: \n      Position 2: O (correct)\n      Position 5: N (correct)\n      R at position 3? That\'s allowed because R must be at 3 or 4.\n      But we have O at position 4? Is that allowed? We don\'t have any feedback about O being duplicated? But the feedback for the second guess: O was at position 2 and correct. If the word has two O\'s, then in the second guess we only had one O? So we wouldn\'t know about the second O? \n\n  But in ""MORON"", we have O at position 2 and 4. In the second guess, we only tested O at position 2 and it was correct. We didn\'t test position 4. So it\'s possible.\n\n  Now, check excluded letters: M, O, R, O, N. M, R, N are not excluded. O is allowed. But we have two O\'s? Is that allowed? The rules don\'t forbid duplicate letters.\n\n  However, in the feedback for the first guess, we had only one R and one N? But the word might have duplicates.\n\n  But in ""MORON"", we have two O\'s. We haven\'t tested O at position 4? So it\'s possible.\n\n  Also, in the first guess, we had A and E which are excluded, but O is not excluded.\n\n  So ""MORON"" is also a candidate.\n\n  Now, we have two candidates: ""MOURN"" and ""MORON"".\n\n  How to decide? We can choose one that tests more letters? \n\n  In ""MOURN"", we test M and U.\n  In ""MORON"", we test M and O (again) and also we are testing if there is a duplicate O? But we already know O is in the word at position 2, so if we get feedback for ""MORON"", we might see if O is at position 4? \n\n  But we are at the third guess, and we have limited tries. We might want to guess the word if possible.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t use M? Because we haven\'t tested M? But we have to use some letter.\n\n  Another candidate: ""DOZEN"" -> but E is excluded? And D is not excluded? But we have O at 2 and N at 5? ""DOZEN"": D O Z E N -> E is excluded? So no.\n\n  ""GOWN"" is 4 letters.\n\n  ""SOUTH"" -> ends with H? Not N.\n\n  ""FOUND"" -> ends with D? Not N.\n\n  ""POUND"" -> same.\n\n  So between ""MOURN"" and ""MORON"", which one?\n\n  Let me see the frequency? Or we can choose one that doesn\'t use a duplicate if we are unsure about duplicates? But we don\'t have information.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn\'t use M? But we don\'t have many options.\n\n  Another word: ""LOURN""? Not a word.\n\n  ""TOURN""? Not a word.\n\n  ""WOUND"" -> ends with D? Not N.\n\n  ""HOUND"" -> same.\n\n  ""ROUND"" -> R O U N D -> but then position 4 is N? And position 5 is D? But we need position 5 to be N? So no.\n\n  So I think we have to choose between ""MOURN"" and ""MORON"".\n\n  But note: in ""MORON"", we have O at position 4. We already know O is at position 2. If the word has two O\'s, that\'s fine. But we don\'t know.\n\n  However, in the second guess, we had ""ROBIN"" and we got O at position 2 correct and N at position 5 correct. The other letters: R was present but wrong position (we had it at 1, but it\'s not at 1) and B and I were absent. \n\n  Now, if the word is ""MORON"", then the R would be at position 3? And we have O at 2 and 4, and N at 5. Then in the second guess, when we guessed ""ROBIN"", we had:\n    R at 1: present but wrong position -> because in the secret word R is at 3? So that\'s consistent.\n    O at 2: correct -> matches.\n    B: absent -> correct because ""MORON"" has no B.\n    I: absent -> correct.\n    N at 5: correct.\n\n  So ""MORON"" is consistent with the feedback.\n\n  Similarly, ""MOURN"" is also consistent: \n    In ""ROBIN"": \n        R at 1: present but wrong position -> in ""MOURN"", R is at 4, so that\'s correct.\n        O at 2: correct.\n        B: absent -> correct.\n        I: absent -> correct.\n        N at 5: correct.\n\n  So both are consistent.\n\n  We need to break the tie.\n\n  We can try to think of other words? \n\n  Another possibility: ""FORUM"" is not 5? It is 5, but ends with M? Not N.\n\n  ""GORGE"" not.\n\n  ""YORKS"" not.\n\n  ""PORKS"" not.\n\n  ""FORKY"" not.\n\n  ""WORDY"" -> W O R D Y -> but then position 5 is Y? Not N.\n\n  So we have two candidates.\n\n  How about ""HORNY""? \n    H O R N Y -> \n      Position 1: H\n      Position 2: O\n      Position 3: R\n      Position 4: N -> but we have N at position 5? And in this word, position 4 is N? But we know from the first guess that N is not at position 4? Because in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position? That means the secret word has N, but not at position 4. So if we put N at position 4 in a guess, it would be wrong? But in the secret word, if it were ""HORNY"", then N is at position 4? That would contradict the first guess feedback? \n\n  Let me check: \n    First guess: ""crane"" had N at position 4. If the secret word is ""HORNY"", then N is at position 4? Then the feedback for the first guess would have marked N as correct? But it was marked as present but wrong position? So that means N is not at position 4. Therefore, ""HORNY"" is invalid because it has N at position 4.\n\n  Similarly, in our pattern, we cannot have N at position 4? Because we know N is at position 5? And also we know from first guess that N is not at position 4? So in the secret word, N is at position 5 and not at position 4? So we must avoid having N at position 4? \n\n  Therefore, in our candidates, we must not have N at position 4? \n\n  Now, in ""MORON"": \n      Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:R, 4:O, 5:N -> no N at position 4? Position 4 is O. So that\'s fine.\n\n  In ""MOURN"":\n      Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:N -> no N at position 4? Position 4 is R. So that\'s fine.\n\n  So both are okay.\n\n  Now, we need to choose one. Let\'s try to use a word that doesn\'t use a duplicate? ""MOURN"" has no duplicate letters, while ""MORON"" has duplicate O. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But they are allowed in Wordle? So both are possible.\n\n  Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests more new letters? But we have to fill the pattern.\n\n  Since we are at the third guess, and we have two possibilities, we might guess one of them.\n\n  I think ""MOURN"" is more common? Or ""MORON""? \n\n  But let me see: we haven\'t tested U and M. We haven\'t tested O in a different position? But we know O is at position 2.\n\n  We can guess ""MOURN"" to test U and M.\n\n  If we guess ""MOURN"" and it\'s not the word, we get feedback on U and M? But if U is not in the word, then we know it must be ""MORON""? \n\n  Similarly, if we guess ""MORON"", and it\'s not the word, then we know it must be ""MOURN""? \n\n  So we can use this guess to distinguish.\n\n  But we have only 6 tries, so we can afford to guess one of them.\n\n  I\'ll choose ""MOURN"" because it has no duplicate letters and might be more common? Or let\'s see frequency.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that is not one of these but tests the letters? For example, a word that has M and also other letters that might be in the word? But we don\'t know.\n\n  But we have to stick to the pattern: _ O _ _ N, with R at 3 or 4.\n\n  Another candidate: ""DOURN""? Not a word.\n\n  ""GOURD"" -> ends with D? Not N.\n\n  ""POURS"" -> ends with S? Not N.\n\n  So I think we have to choose between ""MOURN"" and ""MORON"".\n\n  I\'ll go with ""MOURN"".\n\n  So the third guess: ""MOURN""\n\n  If it\'s not correct, then the word must be ""MORON"", and we can guess that next.\n\n  But let\'s output ""MOURN"".\n\n<guess>mourn</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE**  \n  Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - R and N are in the word but not in positions 2 or 4.  \n  - C, A, E are not in the word.\n\n- **Guess 2: ROBIN**  \n  Feedback: R(-), O(✓), B(x), I(x), N(✓)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - O is in the word and **correctly placed at position 2**.  \n  - N is in the word and **correctly placed at position 5**.  \n  - R is in the word but not at position 1.  \n  - B and I are not in the word.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Fixed positions**:  \n   - Position 2: **O**  \n   - Position 5: **N**  \n   So the word pattern is: `_ O _ _ N`.\n\n2. **R must be at position 3 or 4**:  \n   - From Guess 1, R is not at position 2.  \n   - From Guess 2, R is not at position 1.  \n   - Thus, R can only be at position 3 or 4.\n\n3. **Excluded letters**: C, A, E, B, I (cannot appear anywhere).\n\n4. **Possible words**:  \n   - The word must fit `_ O _ _ N`, with R at position 3 or 4, and no excluded letters.  \n   - After evaluating valid English words, two candidates emerge:  \n     - **MOURN** (M O U R N): R at position 4.  \n     - **MORON** (M O R O N): R at position 3.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **MOURN** is chosen to test:  \n  - M (new letter) at position 1.  \n  - U (new letter) at position 3.  \n  - R at position 4 (plausible per insights).  \n- If **MOURN** is incorrect, feedback will confirm if M or U are in the word, and we can pivot to **MORON** next.\n\n<guess>mourn</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: robin -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) B(x) I(x) N(✓)\nGuess 3: mourn -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(✓) U(x) R(-) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the third guess ""mourn"":
 M: ✓ (correct position) -> so M is at position 1
 O: ✓ (correct position) -> position 2
 U: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 4
 N: ✓ (correct position) -> position 5

 Now, we know:
   Position 1: M (fixed)
   Position 2: O (fixed)
   Position 5: N (fixed)
   R is in the word, but not at position 4 (and we know it's not at position 1,2,5 because those are fixed and not R? Position 1 is M, 2 is O, 5 is N, so R must be at position 3? Because the only position left is 3? But we have position 3 and 4? Wait, the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

 We have:
   Position 1: M (so R cannot be here)
   Position 2: O (so R cannot be here)
   Position 5: N (so R cannot be here)

 And we know R is not at position 4 (from the feedback of ""mourn"": R at position 4 is wrong position? Actually, the feedback for R is ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at position 4? So R must be at position 3? Because that's the only position left? 

 But what about position 3? In ""mourn"", we had U at position 3 and it was marked as not in the word (x). So position 3 is not U and not R? But we just said R must be at position 3? 

 Let me clarify:

 The word has R, but it is not at position 4 (from the feedback of ""mourn""). Also, from previous feedback, R is not at position 1 (from ""robin"") and not at position 2 (from ""crane"" and ""robin"" confirmed O at 2). And position 5 is N. So the only position left for R is position 3.

 But in ""mourn"", we put U at position 3 and it was marked as not in the word (x). So if R is at position 3, then that position is taken by R, so U is not there and not in the word? That's consistent.

 Therefore, we can deduce:
   Position 3 must be R.

 But wait, the feedback for R in ""mourn"" was at position 4? And it was marked as present but wrong position? That means R is in the word, but not at position 4. It doesn't tell us where it is, but we know it must be at position 3 because that's the only position available? 

 So the word so far: M O R _ N

 Now, we need to find the letter at position 4.

 We know from the feedback that U is not in the word (from ""mourn"", U: x).

 Also, we have excluded: C, A, E, B, I, U.

 And we know the word has R at position 3? So the word is M O R ? N.

 Now, what can be at position 4? It must be a letter that is not excluded and forms a valid English word.

 Excluded letters: C, A, E, B, I, U.

 We also know from the first guess: N was present but not at position 4? But now we have N at position 5, so that's fine. And we have R at position 3? But in the first guess, R was at position 2 and it was wrong? Now we have it at position 3? That's consistent.

 Now, for position 4: we need a letter that is not excluded and the word ""MOR?N"" is valid.

 Possible letters: any letter except C, A, E, B, I, U.

 Let's think of common words:

   ""MORN"" is 4 letters? We need 5: M O R _ N.

   Common words: 
      ""MORN"" -> too short.
      ""MORON"" -> M O R O N -> but we have position 4 as O? 
          But we already have O at position 2? And in the feedback for ""robin"", we had O at position 2 correct, but we didn't test O at position 4? So it could be? 

      However, in ""mourn"", we had U at position 3? But now we are putting R at position 3? And position 4 is O? 

      So the word would be ""MORON"".

      Check the feedback for ""mourn"": 
          We guessed ""mourn"": M(1) O(2) U(3) R(4) N(5)
          Feedback: M(✓) O(✓) U(x) R(-) N(✓)

          For ""MORON"": 
            M(1) is correct -> ✓
            O(2) is correct -> ✓
            U(3) is not in the word? In ""MORON"", position 3 is R, not U -> so U is not in the word? Correct, so U(x) is consistent.
            R(4) is in the word? In ""MORON"", R is at position 3, not 4? So R is in the word but not at position 4 -> so (-) is correct.
            N(5) is correct -> ✓

          So ""MORON"" is consistent.

      But we also have to check if there are other possibilities.

      What other letters can be at position 4?

      For example, ""MORAN""? But A is excluded? And not a word? 
      ""MOREN""? E is excluded.
      ""MORIN""? I is excluded.
      ""MORBN""? B is excluded.

      How about ""MORWN""? Not a word.
      ""MORDN""? Not a word.
      ""MORKN""? Not a word.

      ""MORON"" is a word.

      Another possibility: ""MORPH""? But that ends with H? Not N.

      ""MORAS""? Not ending with N.

      ""MORES""? E is excluded.

      ""MORNS""? That's a word: ""morns"" meaning plural of morn? But it ends with S? And we need to end with N? ""MORNS"" is M O R N S -> but we need the fifth letter to be N? That would be position 5? But we have position 5 as N? Then position 4 would be N? But we know from the first guess that N is not at position 4? Because in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position? So if we put N at position 4, it would be invalid? 

      Therefore, position 4 cannot be N? So ""MORNS"" would have N at position 4? That's not allowed? Because we know N is at position 5 and not at position 4? So the word ""morns"" has N at position 4? That would be invalid? 

      So the only common word that fits is ""MORON"".

      But wait, what about ""MOURN""? We already guessed it and it was wrong? Because we got feedback for ""mourn"" that U is not in the word and R is not at position 4? So ""MOURN"" is not the word.

      Therefore, the word must be ""MORON"".

      So we can guess ""MORON"" for the fourth guess.

      But let me confirm the feedback for ""MORON"" with previous guesses:

        Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-) [R is at position 3 in ""MORON"", so not at 2 -> correct], A(x), N(-) [N is at position 5, not 4 -> correct], E(x)

        Guess 2: ""robin"" -> R(-) [R is at position 3, not 1 -> correct], O(✓) [position 2 -> correct], B(x), I(x), N(✓) [position 5 -> correct]

        Guess 3: ""mourn"" -> M(✓), O(✓), U(x), R(-) [R is at position 3, not 4 -> correct], N(✓)

      So ""MORON"" fits all feedback.

      Therefore, we guess ""MORON"".

1. **Guess 1: CRANE**  
   - C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
   - **Insights**:  
     - R and N are in the word, but not in positions 2 or 4.  
     - C, A, E are **not** in the word.

2. **Guess 2: ROBIN**  
   - R(-), O(✓), B(x), I(x), N(✓)  
   - **Insights**:  
     - O is **correct at position 2**.  
     - N is **correct at position 5**.  
     - R is in the word but **not at position 1**.  
     - B and I are **not** in the word.  
     - Word pattern: `_ O _ _ N`.

3. **Guess 3: MOURN**  
   - M(✓), O(✓), U(x), R(-), N(✓)  
   - **Insights**:  
     - M is **correct at position 1**.  
     - O and N remain correct at positions 2 and 5.  
     - U is **not** in the word.  
     - R is in the word but **not at position 4**.  
     - Updated word pattern: `M O _ _ N`.

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 1: **M**  
  - Position 2: **O**  
  - Position 5: **N**  
- **R must be at position 3**:  
  - R cannot be at position 1 (from Guess 2), 2 (fixed as O), 4 (from Guess 3), or 5 (fixed as N).  
  - Thus, R **must** be at position 3.  
  - Word pattern: `M O R _ N`.
- **Position 4 constraints**:  
  - The missing letter must **not** be C, A, E, B, I, or U (all excluded).  
  - It must form a valid English word with `M O R _ N`.
- **Possible words**:  
  - `MORON` (valid word: M O R O N).  
  - Other combinations (e.g., `MORAN`, `MOREN`, `MORIN`) are invalid due to excluded letters or non-words.  
- **Consistency check**:  
  - `MORON` fits all feedback:  
    - R is at position 3 (not 1, 2, or 4).  
    - O at position 2 and 4 is allowed (duplicates are possible).  
    - All excluded letters (C, A, E, B, I, U) are avoided.

### Next Guess:
- **MORON** is the only common English word that fits the pattern and feedback.  
- If correct, this solves the puzzle.

<guess>moron</guess>",moron,"We have the feedback from the third guess ""mourn"":
 M: ✓ (correct position) -> so M is at position 1
 O: ✓ (correct position) -> position 2
 U: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 4
 N: ✓ (correct position) -> position 5

 Now, we know:
   Position 1: M (fixed)
   Position 2: O (fixed)
   Position 5: N (fixed)
   R is in the word, but not at position 4 (and we know it's not at position 1,2,5 because those are fixed and not R? Position 1 is M, 2 is O, 5 is N, so R must be at position 3? Because the only position left is 3? But we have position 3 and 4? Wait, the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

 We have:
   Position 1: M (so R cannot be here)
   Position 2: O (so R cannot be here)
   Position 5: N (so R cannot be here)

 And we know R is not at position 4 (from the feedback of ""mourn"": R at position 4 is wrong position? Actually, the feedback for R is ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at position 4? So R must be at position 3? Because that's the only position left? 

 But what about position 3? In ""mourn"", we had U at position 3 and it was marked as not in the word (x). So position 3 is not U and not R? But we just said R must be at position 3? 

 Let me clarify:

 The word has R, but it is not at position 4 (from the feedback of ""mourn""). Also, from previous feedback, R is not at position 1 (from ""robin"") and not at position 2 (from ""crane"" and ""robin"" confirmed O at 2). And position 5 is N. So the only position left for R is position 3.

 But in ""mourn"", we put U at position 3 and it was marked as not in the word (x). So if R is at position 3, then that position is taken by R, so U is not there and not in the word? That's consistent.

 Therefore, we can deduce:
   Position 3 must be R.

 But wait, the feedback for R in ""mourn"" was at position 4? And it was marked as present but wrong position? That means R is in the word, but not at position 4. It doesn't tell us where it is, but we know it must be at position 3 because that's the only position available? 

 So the word so far: M O R _ N

 Now, we need to find the letter at position 4.

 We know from the feedback that U is not in the word (from ""mourn"", U: x).

 Also, we have excluded: C, A, E, B, I, U.

 And we know the word has R at position 3? So the word is M O R ? N.

 Now, what can be at position 4? It must be a letter that is not excluded and forms a valid English word.

 Excluded letters: C, A, E, B, I, U.

 We also know from the first guess: N was present but not at position 4? But now we have N at position 5, so that's fine. And we have R at position 3? But in the first guess, R was at position 2 and it was wrong? Now we have it at position 3? That's consistent.

 Now, for position 4: we need a letter that is not excluded and the word ""MOR?N"" is valid.

 Possible letters: any letter except C, A, E, B, I, U.

 Let's think of common words:

   ""MORN"" is 4 letters? We need 5: M O R _ N.

   Common words: 
      ""MORN"" -> too short.
      ""MORON"" -> M O R O N -> but we have position 4 as O? 
          But we already have O at position 2? And in the feedback for ""robin"", we had O at position 2 correct, but we didn't test O at position 4? So it could be? 

      However, in ""mourn"", we had U at position 3? But now we are putting R at position 3? And position 4 is O? 

      So the word would be ""MORON"".

      Check the feedback for ""mourn"": 
          We guessed ""mourn"": M(1) O(2) U(3) R(4) N(5)
          Feedback: M(✓) O(✓) U(x) R(-) N(✓)

          For ""MORON"": 
            M(1) is correct -> ✓
            O(2) is correct -> ✓
            U(3) is not in the word? In ""MORON"", position 3 is R, not U -> so U is not in the word? Correct, so U(x) is consistent.
            R(4) is in the word? In ""MORON"", R is at position 3, not 4? So R is in the word but not at position 4 -> so (-) is correct.
            N(5) is correct -> ✓

          So ""MORON"" is consistent.

      But we also have to check if there are other possibilities.

      What other letters can be at position 4?

      For example, ""MORAN""? But A is excluded? And not a word? 
      ""MOREN""? E is excluded.
      ""MORIN""? I is excluded.
      ""MORBN""? B is excluded.

      How about ""MORWN""? Not a word.
      ""MORDN""? Not a word.
      ""MORKN""? Not a word.

      ""MORON"" is a word.

      Another possibility: ""MORPH""? But that ends with H? Not N.

      ""MORAS""? Not ending with N.

      ""MORES""? E is excluded.

      ""MORNS""? That's a word: ""morns"" meaning plural of morn? But it ends with S? And we need to end with N? ""MORNS"" is M O R N S -> but we need the fifth letter to be N? That would be position 5? But we have position 5 as N? Then position 4 would be N? But we know from the first guess that N is not at position 4? Because in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position? So if we put N at position 4, it would be invalid? 

      Therefore, position 4 cannot be N? So ""MORNS"" would have N at position 4? That's not allowed? Because we know N is at position 5 and not at position 4? So the word ""morns"" has N at position 4? That would be invalid? 

      So the only common word that fits is ""MORON"".

      But wait, what about ""MOURN""? We already guessed it and it was wrong? Because we got feedback for ""mourn"" that U is not in the word and R is not at position 4? So ""MOURN"" is not the word.

      Therefore, the word must be ""MORON"".

      So we can guess ""MORON"" for the fourth guess.

      But let me confirm the feedback for ""MORON"" with previous guesses:

        Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-) [R is at position 3 in ""MORON"", so not at 2 -> correct], A(x), N(-) [N is at position 5, not 4 -> correct], E(x)

        Guess 2: ""robin"" -> R(-) [R is at position 3, not 1 -> correct], O(✓) [position 2 -> correct], B(x), I(x), N(✓) [position 5 -> correct]

        Guess 3: ""mourn"" -> M(✓), O(✓), U(x), R(-) [R is at position 3, not 4 -> correct], N(✓)

      So ""MORON"" fits all feedback.

      Therefore, we guess ""MORON"".
