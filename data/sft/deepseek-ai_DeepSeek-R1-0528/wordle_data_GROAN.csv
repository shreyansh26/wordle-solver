We are making the first guess. There's no prior feedback, so we need a starting word.
 Common strategies suggest using a word with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 A good starting word in Wordle is often ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"", but here we can choose a word that maximizes information.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: S, L, A, T, E. The word ""SLATE"" is a good candidate because:
  - It has three vowels (if we consider A and E) and two common consonants (S, L, T).
  - It covers some of the most frequent letters in English.

 Alternatively, note that the feedback symbols are: ✓ (correct), - (present but wrong position), x (absent).

 Since this is the first guess, we have no information. Let's go with ""CRANE"". It's also a popular starting word because it covers C, R, A, N, E.

 But let's consider: we want to eliminate as many possibilities as possible.

 After checking common starting words, I decide to use ""SLATE"".

 However, let me pick ""RAISE"". It has R, A, I, S, E. It covers two vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S). 

 Actually, let me use ""CRANE"". It's a standard choice.

 But note: the example given by the problem used ""STORM"" and then ""BRAVE"", which are not optimal starters. Since we are playing optimally, we choose a word with high-frequency letters.

 According to various analyses, one of the best starting words is ""ROATE"" (which is not common) but we can stick with more common ones.

 Since this is our first guess, any word that gives a lot of information is good.

 Let me choose ""SLATE"":
   S, L, A, T, E

 However, to be different, let's pick ""CRATE"".

 Alternatively, I notice that the example used words starting with ""S"" and then ""B"", so let's avoid being biased.

 Decision: I will choose ""RAISE"" because it contains A, E (vowels) and R, S (common consonants). It also includes I (another vowel).

 But if we are to choose a word without duplicate letters, ""RAISE"" is perfect.

 So, first guess: RAISE

 We'll write: <guess>RAISE</guess>
</think>
I am making my first guess in this word-guessing game. Since I have no prior feedback, I need a strategic starting word that maximizes information. A good opening word should include common vowels and consonants to test multiple frequent letters. ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:

- It contains **three vowels (A, I, E)**, increasing the chance of revealing vowel positions.
- It includes **common consonants (R, S)**, which often appear in English words.
- All letters are distinct, ensuring I test five unique characters.

This word covers 40% of the vowels and provides high-frequency consonants. Based on common Wordle strategies, ""RAISE"" yields broad insights about the secret word through feedback.

We have feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R → (-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 1.
  A → (-) meaning A is in the word but not in position 2.
  I → (x) meaning I is not in the word at all.
  S → (x) meaning S is not in the word.
  E → (x) meaning E is not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains R and A, but neither is in the correct position from the first guess.
- The secret word does not contain I, S, E.

Also, since R is in the word but not in position 1, and A is in the word but not in position 2, we must place them in different positions.

We are to make the second guess.

Constraints:
- The secret word is 5 letters long.
- It contains R and A, and does not contain I, S, E.
- The word must be a valid English word.

We must consider the positions:
- R cannot be in position 1 (since it was in position 1 in RAISE and got ""-"", meaning it's present but wrong position).
- A cannot be in position 2.

Additionally, we may try to include other common letters to test for presence.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the ones we know are not in the word (I, S, E). Also, we know that the word has R and A.

We can consider other vowels: O, U are vowels left. Consonants: Many, but avoid S,E,I.

Since we have two known letters (R and A) that must be in different positions, we can try placing them in possible positions.

Let's think about the possible positions for R and A:

R was in position 1, so it must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5.
A was in position 2, so it must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5.

But note: the secret word must have R and A, and they are not in the same position as before.

Also, the word cannot have I, S, E.

What are common words that contain R and A, and exclude I,S,E?

We can try to form words that place R and A in positions other than 1 and 2 respectively.

For example, let's try placing A in position 1 and R in position 3? But note, if A is in position 1, that is acceptable because in the first guess A was in position 2 and was wrong. But now position 1 is open.

Similarly, R can go in other positions.

We also want to test new letters. Common letters to test: T, N, L, O, U, C, D, M, P, etc.

Since we have few known letters, we should maximize information by using a word that introduces new common letters and places R and A in incorrect positions.

Let me list possible positions for the second guess:

- Position 1: Cannot be R (from first guess position). Also cannot be A if we think it might be, but we have no restriction on A for position 1? Actually, we only know that A is not in position 2. So it can be in 1,3,4,5.
We can try A in position 1? But let's see.

Alternatively, we can avoid position 1 for A because we don't know yet, but it is allowed.

Possible guess: Let's try ""AUDIO""? But we know that I is not in the word, so we shouldn't reuse I. And also E and S are out. So ""AUDIO"" has I and O and U and D. But we know I isn't in the word, so it's wasteful to use I.

We should avoid letters we know are absent: I,S,E.

So let's consider a word without I,S,E and that includes R and A.

Also, since we are in second guess, we can aim to cover many new letters.

Possible words: 
- Having A and R: but placed in positions that are not 1 and not 2? Or we can reposition.

For instance, if we put A in position 1? Then we must put R in a position that is not 1 (which is automatic) and also not the position it was (so avoid 1) but also we only know it cannot be in 1. Actually R must be in 2,3,4,5. But we must be careful: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 1. Same for A: not in position 2.

So if we put A in position 1, that's allowed because the first guess had A in position 2. Similarly, R in position 2 is allowed? Because the first guess had R in position 1, so position 2 is different. But we don't know if R is in position 2 until we try.

So we can try a word that has A in position 1 and R somewhere else? But we also want to test new letters.

Another idea: use a word that places R somewhere else and A somewhere else, and includes other common letters.

Common letters we haven't tested: T, O, L, N, etc.

Let me try to form a word:

Option 1: ""A"" at position 1, and R at position 3? Then we can have letters in between.

Word: A _ R _ _

But without I,S,E.

Example: ""CARTY""? Not a word. ""PARTY""? But that has P,A,R,T,Y. However, P and T are new. ""PARTY"": 
- P at position 1? We are considering A at position 1? So if we put A at 1, then we cannot put R at the same position? So we need a word starting with A.

Word: ""ALARM""? But we know A is in the word, but in our word we can put A at 1? And R at 4 or 5? Let's see: ""ALARM"": A at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Duplicate A? But the word ""alarm"" has two A's. But in the feedback, we don't know about multiple letters. We must be cautious.

But our first guess had only one A? And the feedback for A was ""-"", meaning there's at least one A. But the word might have more? However, we don't know.

But we should avoid using duplicate letters for now unless necessary? But we can try.

Another word: ""ADORN""? But has O, R, N, D, A? Positions: A at 1, R at 3? But ""ADORN"" is A-D-O-R-N. Position of R is 4? Actually: 
A (position1), D(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). 
So A is at 1 (which is allowed because it's not position2) and R is at 4 (allowed because it's not position1).

Also, no I,S,E.

But note, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it can be in multiple positions? But that's okay.

But also, we are introducing D,O,N.

Another common word: ""ROBOT""? But R at position1? But we know R is present but cannot be at position1? So if we use ""ROBOT"", we put R at position1, which would be invalid? Because the previous feedback said that R is not at position1. So we cannot place R at position1 in any subsequent guess? Actually, we are allowed to guess any word, but logically, since we know R is not at position1, we shouldn't put it there again to save a guess.

Therefore, we must avoid position1 for R.

Similarly, avoid position2 for A.

So words:
- Position1: cannot be R (if we put R it would be a waste, we know it's wrong). It can be A or other letters.

Now, consider ""A____"" words? Then A is at position1.

But we must put R in a position other than 1? Probably positions 2,3,4,5.

But note: if we put R at position2? That is acceptable? Because first word had R at1, so position2 is new. Similarly, A at position1 is new (since it was at2).

We can try ""AUDIO"" but without I? We must skip I. So not.

Word: ""ABOUT"": A at1, B at2, O at3, U at4, T at5? But we don't know if B,O,U,T are in the word? And we need to incorporate R? Wait, ""ABOUT"" doesn't have R? But we know R must be in the word. So we cannot skip R? Because if we don't include R, then we might miss the chance to locate its position.

We must include R and A in our guess? Because we know they are in the word? Actually, it's not mandatory. We could skip R or A to test more letters? But then we won't get information about R and A's positions? We could, but since we know they are present, we might as well include them to get positional data.

So ideally, we include both R and A.

Also, avoid positions: R not in1, A not in2.

So a word that has R and A, with R not in1 and A not in2.

Possible structures:

- R in position2? Then A in positions3,4,5? But A cannot be in2? Wait, if we put R in2, then A can be in 3,4,5? or in1? Yes A can be in1.

But let's avoid A in2? The rule: A is in the word but not in position2. So we can put A in position1? Or other positions.

Alternatively, R can be in position3? Then A can be in position1? Or 4 or 5.

For example: 
- Let A be at1? Then R at3: A _ R _ _
Example words: ""PARTY"" (P is not common? ...), ""CARDS""? But has S? S is forbidden? Because S is out? But we don't have S in the word? Wait, ""CARDS"" has S? So invalid? We must guess without S,E,I.

""CARDS"": C,A,R,D,S → with S? Not allowed because S is absent? So we can only use letters we haven't ruled out? Actually, we can guess any word, but if a letter is not in the secret word, we might waste a slot. So best avoid known absent letters.

Therefore, avoid S,E,I.

So for A1 and R3: Words? ""CARTY"" not a word. ""BARED"" has E? E is absent. ""FARED"" has E? E absent.

Without E: ""MARVY""? Not common. How about ""HARDY""? H at1, A at2? Wait, A at position2? We cannot put A at position2 because we know A is not in position2? So ""HARDY"" has A at2? Which would be the same as before? And since we know A is not at2, if we guess A at2, it would be shown as ""-"" again? But that provides no new information? Or so, it would reconfirm? But we can do better.

To maximize information, we should avoid placing A at2.

Similarly, avoid R at1.

So A1 and R3: Let's think of words: ""LABOR""? But L at2, A at not 1? In ""LABOR"": L1,A2,B3,O4,R5 → A is at2? Which is not allowed? We cannot put A at2 because it was already incorrect? We can put A at2, but if we do, the feedback will again say ""-"" for A? Because it's still not correct (unless the secret word has A at2? But we know it doesn't? Actually, we know that A is in the word but not at position2? So if we put A at2 again, it will be wrong again? And we get ""-"" again? So it doesn't help us to locate A? We should put A in a new position: position1,3,4,5.

Similarly for R: must avoid position1? So position2,3,4,5.

Therefore, for our guess, we should try A in position 1? Then R in position 3? That way we potentially learn about A at1 and R at3.

So find word: A at1, R at3? And without I,S,E.

Possible options:
- ""PARKY"": not common? Or ""TAROK""? Also rare.
- ""MANOR""? M1,A2? But A at2 invalid? We avoid A at2? So positions: A at1, M at2? Then R at3: so A1,M2,R3. Then two more letters? ""MANOR"": A is at2? No: M-A-N-O-R? M1, A2? But we want A at1? So not.
- ""A"" at1, then R at3: so A--R-
Words: ""AIRCY""? Not. ""AIRTH""? Not. With no I: ""ALARM""? But ""ALARM"": A1, L2, A3? Duplicate A? Then R at4? So position3 has A? Which is not in the known positions? But we are including A twice? Which might cause issues? If the letter A appears only once, then the feedback might be messy? But let's avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""ADORE""? But E is absent? So no.

""ABHOR"": A1,B2,H3,O4,R5. That works? R at position5? Not at3? So we don't have R at3? But we need R? And we have R at5? That's okay? Position5 is fine? Because it was position1 before? So different.

""ABHOR"": A1,B2,H3,O4,R5.

But we know E is absent? Yes.

We could use ""ABORT""? But O and R T? A1,B2,O3,R4,T5? But R at4? That's fine.

Also common word.

But note: both avoid duplicate letters and include R and A in positions: A not in2? A is at1? Okay. R not in1? R at4 or 5? Okay.

Another word: ""RADAR""? Has R at1? But we cannot put R at1? Because we know it's not there? Also has two R's? And two A's? Complicated? Avoid.

Better: ""ABOUT"" is popular, but no R? So skip.

Since we want to cover many letters, choose ""ABHOR"" or ""ABORT"".

But ""ABHOR"" is less common? We want valid English words.

""ABORT"" is common: meaning to terminate. So A1, B2, O3, R4, T5.

This includes:
- A at1: if correct, we get ✓ for A? Because A is in the word, and position1.
- B2: unknown
- O3: unknown
- R4: R is in the word, if at position4? Currently trying position4? Previously at1? So different.
- T5: unknown

We introduce B,O,T? Then we can get feedback on them.

Alternatively, another common word: ""ROUTE""? But R at1? Avoid R at1? Cannot.

""TRAIN""? But has I? I is absent? Cannot.

""PLANT""? P L A N T? But A is at position3? Which is valid? Positions: P1, L2, A3, N4, T5? Then R is missing? We haven't included R? So we don't get information about R? But we know R is in the word? So we might not locate it? But we are testing other letters.

But we could: then if we get feedback on A? We already know A is present, and by putting at position3, we may get more?

Also, if we omit R, we can get confirmation that R is still there? Actually, by including R, we get position feedback? Better to include.

So I think including both A and R is better.

Therefore, ""ABORT"": A1,B2,O3,R4,T5.

Word: ABORT.

Now, let me confirm the letters to avoid: I,S,E not present? ABORT has A,B,O,R,T? None of these are I,S,E? Good.

We will see:
- If A is at position1, we get ✓ for A? Or if not, but A is present, we might get ""-""?
  Because we know A is in the word? If the secret word has A at1, then A would be correct? If not, then A is elsewhere? So we are testing position1 for A.
- Similarly, R at position4? Testing that.

Also B,O,T are new.

Second option: ""GARTH""? G1,A2? But A at2? We know A is not at2? So avoid? Also not common.

""YARNS""? Y1,A2? Avoid.

So ""ABORT"" seems good.

Another word: ""ACTOR""? A1,C2,T3,O4,R5? R at5? Then includes C,T,O? Also valid.

Similar? Or ""ABHOR"" as before: A1,B2,H3,O4,R5. H is less common.

So choose between ABORT and ACTOR.

ABORT: A,B,O,R,T
ACTOR: A,C,T,O,R → same letters essentially? But different positions: R in ABORT at4, in ACTOR at5? 

We don't know which is better? Both are common.

I'll pick ABORT because it's a bit more common? Or ACTOR is also common.

But ACTOR has the letter C? Which is less common than B? Actually, both B and C are not too common? But let's not worry.

Alternatively, since the first feedback had R in the first guess at position1? So R was at1? Then putting R at4 or5 might be a good test.

I think ABORT is fine.

So second guess: ABORT

In response format: we output the word.

But think step by step.

Conclusion: 
- We must include R and A? Well, not mandatory? But we know they are present? Including them helps to find their positions? Also, avoids wasting a guess? We would know if the position is correct.

Therefore, guess ""ABORT"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback
From the first guess ""RAISE"":
- **R** was marked `-`: It is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- **A** was marked `-`: It is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- **I**, **S**, and **E** were marked `x`: These letters are **not** in the secret word.

### Key Insights:
1. **R and A are present**: Both must appear in the secret word, but R cannot be in position 1, and A cannot be in position 2.
2. **Excluded letters**: Avoid using I, S, or E in future guesses, as they are not in the word.
3. **Strategy for second guess**: 
   - Prioritize words that include **R and A** to test new positions.
   - Place R in a position other than 1 (e.g., 2, 3, 4, or 5) and A in a position other than 2 (e.g., 1, 3, 4, or 5).
   - Maximize new information by including high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, O, B, N) and vowels (e.g., O, U), avoiding excluded letters.
   - Avoid repeating the positions from the first guess: R cannot be guessed at position 1, and A cannot be guessed at position 2.

### Why Guess ""ABORT""?
- **Positions**: Places A at position 1 (new position to test) and R at position 4 (different from position 1).
- **Included letters**: Introduces **B**, **O**, and **T**, common consonants not yet tested.
- **Excluded letters**: Avoids I, S, E (all ruled out).
- **Word validity**: ""ABORT"" is a valid English word (5 letters).

### Expected Outcomes:
- If A is in position 1, it will be marked `✓`; otherwise, `-` (since A is present).
- If R is in position 4, it will be marked `✓`; otherwise, `-`.
- Feedback on B, O, and T will reveal if they are in the word and/or in the correct positions.

<guess>ABORT</guess>",ABORT,"We have feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R → (-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 1.
  A → (-) meaning A is in the word but not in position 2.
  I → (x) meaning I is not in the word at all.
  S → (x) meaning S is not in the word.
  E → (x) meaning E is not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains R and A, but neither is in the correct position from the first guess.
- The secret word does not contain I, S, E.

Also, since R is in the word but not in position 1, and A is in the word but not in position 2, we must place them in different positions.

We are to make the second guess.

Constraints:
- The secret word is 5 letters long.
- It contains R and A, and does not contain I, S, E.
- The word must be a valid English word.

We must consider the positions:
- R cannot be in position 1 (since it was in position 1 in RAISE and got ""-"", meaning it's present but wrong position).
- A cannot be in position 2.

Additionally, we may try to include other common letters to test for presence.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the ones we know are not in the word (I, S, E). Also, we know that the word has R and A.

We can consider other vowels: O, U are vowels left. Consonants: Many, but avoid S,E,I.

Since we have two known letters (R and A) that must be in different positions, we can try placing them in possible positions.

Let's think about the possible positions for R and A:

R was in position 1, so it must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5.
A was in position 2, so it must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5.

But note: the secret word must have R and A, and they are not in the same position as before.

Also, the word cannot have I, S, E.

What are common words that contain R and A, and exclude I,S,E?

We can try to form words that place R and A in positions other than 1 and 2 respectively.

For example, let's try placing A in position 1 and R in position 3? But note, if A is in position 1, that is acceptable because in the first guess A was in position 2 and was wrong. But now position 1 is open.

Similarly, R can go in other positions.

We also want to test new letters. Common letters to test: T, N, L, O, U, C, D, M, P, etc.

Since we have few known letters, we should maximize information by using a word that introduces new common letters and places R and A in incorrect positions.

Let me list possible positions for the second guess:

- Position 1: Cannot be R (from first guess position). Also cannot be A if we think it might be, but we have no restriction on A for position 1? Actually, we only know that A is not in position 2. So it can be in 1,3,4,5.
We can try A in position 1? But let's see.

Alternatively, we can avoid position 1 for A because we don't know yet, but it is allowed.

Possible guess: Let's try ""AUDIO""? But we know that I is not in the word, so we shouldn't reuse I. And also E and S are out. So ""AUDIO"" has I and O and U and D. But we know I isn't in the word, so it's wasteful to use I.

We should avoid letters we know are absent: I,S,E.

So let's consider a word without I,S,E and that includes R and A.

Also, since we are in second guess, we can aim to cover many new letters.

Possible words: 
- Having A and R: but placed in positions that are not 1 and not 2? Or we can reposition.

For instance, if we put A in position 1? Then we must put R in a position that is not 1 (which is automatic) and also not the position it was (so avoid 1) but also we only know it cannot be in 1. Actually R must be in 2,3,4,5. But we must be careful: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 1. Same for A: not in position 2.

So if we put A in position 1, that's allowed because the first guess had A in position 2. Similarly, R in position 2 is allowed? Because the first guess had R in position 1, so position 2 is different. But we don't know if R is in position 2 until we try.

So we can try a word that has A in position 1 and R somewhere else? But we also want to test new letters.

Another idea: use a word that places R somewhere else and A somewhere else, and includes other common letters.

Common letters we haven't tested: T, O, L, N, etc.

Let me try to form a word:

Option 1: ""A"" at position 1, and R at position 3? Then we can have letters in between.

Word: A _ R _ _

But without I,S,E.

Example: ""CARTY""? Not a word. ""PARTY""? But that has P,A,R,T,Y. However, P and T are new. ""PARTY"": 
- P at position 1? We are considering A at position 1? So if we put A at 1, then we cannot put R at the same position? So we need a word starting with A.

Word: ""ALARM""? But we know A is in the word, but in our word we can put A at 1? And R at 4 or 5? Let's see: ""ALARM"": A at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Duplicate A? But the word ""alarm"" has two A's. But in the feedback, we don't know about multiple letters. We must be cautious.

But our first guess had only one A? And the feedback for A was ""-"", meaning there's at least one A. But the word might have more? However, we don't know.

But we should avoid using duplicate letters for now unless necessary? But we can try.

Another word: ""ADORN""? But has O, R, N, D, A? Positions: A at 1, R at 3? But ""ADORN"" is A-D-O-R-N. Position of R is 4? Actually: 
A (position1), D(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). 
So A is at 1 (which is allowed because it's not position2) and R is at 4 (allowed because it's not position1).

Also, no I,S,E.

But note, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it can be in multiple positions? But that's okay.

But also, we are introducing D,O,N.

Another common word: ""ROBOT""? But R at position1? But we know R is present but cannot be at position1? So if we use ""ROBOT"", we put R at position1, which would be invalid? Because the previous feedback said that R is not at position1. So we cannot place R at position1 in any subsequent guess? Actually, we are allowed to guess any word, but logically, since we know R is not at position1, we shouldn't put it there again to save a guess.

Therefore, we must avoid position1 for R.

Similarly, avoid position2 for A.

So words:
- Position1: cannot be R (if we put R it would be a waste, we know it's wrong). It can be A or other letters.

Now, consider ""A____"" words? Then A is at position1.

But we must put R in a position other than 1? Probably positions 2,3,4,5.

But note: if we put R at position2? That is acceptable? Because first word had R at1, so position2 is new. Similarly, A at position1 is new (since it was at2).

We can try ""AUDIO"" but without I? We must skip I. So not.

Word: ""ABOUT"": A at1, B at2, O at3, U at4, T at5? But we don't know if B,O,U,T are in the word? And we need to incorporate R? Wait, ""ABOUT"" doesn't have R? But we know R must be in the word. So we cannot skip R? Because if we don't include R, then we might miss the chance to locate its position.

We must include R and A in our guess? Because we know they are in the word? Actually, it's not mandatory. We could skip R or A to test more letters? But then we won't get information about R and A's positions? We could, but since we know they are present, we might as well include them to get positional data.

So ideally, we include both R and A.

Also, avoid positions: R not in1, A not in2.

So a word that has R and A, with R not in1 and A not in2.

Possible structures:

- R in position2? Then A in positions3,4,5? But A cannot be in2? Wait, if we put R in2, then A can be in 3,4,5? or in1? Yes A can be in1.

But let's avoid A in2? The rule: A is in the word but not in position2. So we can put A in position1? Or other positions.

Alternatively, R can be in position3? Then A can be in position1? Or 4 or 5.

For example: 
- Let A be at1? Then R at3: A _ R _ _
Example words: ""PARTY"" (P is not common? ...), ""CARDS""? But has S? S is forbidden? Because S is out? But we don't have S in the word? Wait, ""CARDS"" has S? So invalid? We must guess without S,E,I.

""CARDS"": C,A,R,D,S → with S? Not allowed because S is absent? So we can only use letters we haven't ruled out? Actually, we can guess any word, but if a letter is not in the secret word, we might waste a slot. So best avoid known absent letters.

Therefore, avoid S,E,I.

So for A1 and R3: Words? ""CARTY"" not a word. ""BARED"" has E? E is absent. ""FARED"" has E? E absent.

Without E: ""MARVY""? Not common. How about ""HARDY""? H at1, A at2? Wait, A at position2? We cannot put A at position2 because we know A is not in position2? So ""HARDY"" has A at2? Which would be the same as before? And since we know A is not at2, if we guess A at2, it would be shown as ""-"" again? But that provides no new information? Or so, it would reconfirm? But we can do better.

To maximize information, we should avoid placing A at2.

Similarly, avoid R at1.

So A1 and R3: Let's think of words: ""LABOR""? But L at2, A at not 1? In ""LABOR"": L1,A2,B3,O4,R5 → A is at2? Which is not allowed? We cannot put A at2 because it was already incorrect? We can put A at2, but if we do, the feedback will again say ""-"" for A? Because it's still not correct (unless the secret word has A at2? But we know it doesn't? Actually, we know that A is in the word but not at position2? So if we put A at2 again, it will be wrong again? And we get ""-"" again? So it doesn't help us to locate A? We should put A in a new position: position1,3,4,5.

Similarly for R: must avoid position1? So position2,3,4,5.

Therefore, for our guess, we should try A in position 1? Then R in position 3? That way we potentially learn about A at1 and R at3.

So find word: A at1, R at3? And without I,S,E.

Possible options:
- ""PARKY"": not common? Or ""TAROK""? Also rare.
- ""MANOR""? M1,A2? But A at2 invalid? We avoid A at2? So positions: A at1, M at2? Then R at3: so A1,M2,R3. Then two more letters? ""MANOR"": A is at2? No: M-A-N-O-R? M1, A2? But we want A at1? So not.
- ""A"" at1, then R at3: so A--R-
Words: ""AIRCY""? Not. ""AIRTH""? Not. With no I: ""ALARM""? But ""ALARM"": A1, L2, A3? Duplicate A? Then R at4? So position3 has A? Which is not in the known positions? But we are including A twice? Which might cause issues? If the letter A appears only once, then the feedback might be messy? But let's avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""ADORE""? But E is absent? So no.

""ABHOR"": A1,B2,H3,O4,R5. That works? R at position5? Not at3? So we don't have R at3? But we need R? And we have R at5? That's okay? Position5 is fine? Because it was position1 before? So different.

""ABHOR"": A1,B2,H3,O4,R5.

But we know E is absent? Yes.

We could use ""ABORT""? But O and R T? A1,B2,O3,R4,T5? But R at4? That's fine.

Also common word.

But note: both avoid duplicate letters and include R and A in positions: A not in2? A is at1? Okay. R not in1? R at4 or 5? Okay.

Another word: ""RADAR""? Has R at1? But we cannot put R at1? Because we know it's not there? Also has two R's? And two A's? Complicated? Avoid.

Better: ""ABOUT"" is popular, but no R? So skip.

Since we want to cover many letters, choose ""ABHOR"" or ""ABORT"".

But ""ABHOR"" is less common? We want valid English words.

""ABORT"" is common: meaning to terminate. So A1, B2, O3, R4, T5.

This includes:
- A at1: if correct, we get ✓ for A? Because A is in the word, and position1.
- B2: unknown
- O3: unknown
- R4: R is in the word, if at position4? Currently trying position4? Previously at1? So different.
- T5: unknown

We introduce B,O,T? Then we can get feedback on them.

Alternatively, another common word: ""ROUTE""? But R at1? Avoid R at1? Cannot.

""TRAIN""? But has I? I is absent? Cannot.

""PLANT""? P L A N T? But A is at position3? Which is valid? Positions: P1, L2, A3, N4, T5? Then R is missing? We haven't included R? So we don't get information about R? But we know R is in the word? So we might not locate it? But we are testing other letters.

But we could: then if we get feedback on A? We already know A is present, and by putting at position3, we may get more?

Also, if we omit R, we can get confirmation that R is still there? Actually, by including R, we get position feedback? Better to include.

So I think including both A and R is better.

Therefore, ""ABORT"": A1,B2,O3,R4,T5.

Word: ABORT.

Now, let me confirm the letters to avoid: I,S,E not present? ABORT has A,B,O,R,T? None of these are I,S,E? Good.

We will see:
- If A is at position1, we get ✓ for A? Or if not, but A is present, we might get ""-""?
  Because we know A is in the word? If the secret word has A at1, then A would be correct? If not, then A is elsewhere? So we are testing position1 for A.
- Similarly, R at position4? Testing that.

Also B,O,T are new.

Second option: ""GARTH""? G1,A2? But A at2? We know A is not at2? So avoid? Also not common.

""YARNS""? Y1,A2? Avoid.

So ""ABORT"" seems good.

Another word: ""ACTOR""? A1,C2,T3,O4,R5? R at5? Then includes C,T,O? Also valid.

Similar? Or ""ABHOR"" as before: A1,B2,H3,O4,R5. H is less common.

So choose between ABORT and ACTOR.

ABORT: A,B,O,R,T
ACTOR: A,C,T,O,R → same letters essentially? But different positions: R in ABORT at4, in ACTOR at5? 

We don't know which is better? Both are common.

I'll pick ABORT because it's a bit more common? Or ACTOR is also common.

But ACTOR has the letter C? Which is less common than B? Actually, both B and C are not too common? But let's not worry.

Alternatively, since the first feedback had R in the first guess at position1? So R was at1? Then putting R at4 or5 might be a good test.

I think ABORT is fine.

So second guess: ABORT

In response format: we output the word.

But think step by step.

Conclusion: 
- We must include R and A? Well, not mandatory? But we know they are present? Including them helps to find their positions? Also, avoids wasting a guess? We would know if the position is correct.

Therefore, guess ""ABORT"".

<guess>ABORT</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback
From the first guess ""RAISE"":
- **R** was marked `-`: It is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- **A** was marked `-`: It is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- **I**, **S**, and **E** were marked `x`: These letters are **not** in the secret word.

### Key Insights:
1. **R and A are present**: Both must appear in the secret word, but R cannot be in position 1, and A cannot be in position 2.
2. **Excluded letters**: Avoid using I, S, or E in future guesses, as they are not in the word.
3. **Strategy for second guess**: 
   - Prioritize words that include **R and A** to test new positions.
   - Place R in a position other than 1 (e.g., 2, 3, 4, or 5) and A in a position other than 2 (e.g., 1, 3, 4, or 5).
   - Maximize new information by including high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, O, B, N) and vowels (e.g., O, U), avoiding excluded letters.
   - Avoid repeating the positions from the first guess: R cannot be guessed at position 1, and A cannot be guessed at position 2.

### Why Guess ""ABORT""?
- **Positions**: Places A at position 1 (new position to test) and R at position 4 (different from position 1).
- **Included letters**: Introduces **B**, **O**, and **T**, common consonants not yet tested.
- **Excluded letters**: Avoids I, S, E (all ruled out).
- **Word validity**: ""ABORT"" is a valid English word (5 letters).

### Expected Outcomes:
- If A is in position 1, it will be marked `✓`; otherwise, `-` (since A is present).
- If R is in position 4, it will be marked `✓`; otherwise, `-`.
- Feedback on B, O, and T will reveal if they are in the word and/or in the correct positions.",Guess 2: ABORT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(✓) R(-) T(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There's no prior feedback, so we need a starting word.
 Common strategies suggest using a word with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 A good starting word in Wordle is often ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"", but here we can choose a word that maximizes information.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: S, L, A, T, E. The word ""SLATE"" is a good candidate because:
  - It has three vowels (if we consider A and E) and two common consonants (S, L, T).
  - It covers some of the most frequent letters in English.

 Alternatively, note that the feedback symbols are: ✓ (correct), - (present but wrong position), x (absent).

 Since this is the first guess, we have no information. Let's go with ""CRANE"". It's also a popular starting word because it covers C, R, A, N, E.

 But let's consider: we want to eliminate as many possibilities as possible.

 After checking common starting words, I decide to use ""SLATE"".

 However, let me pick ""RAISE"". It has R, A, I, S, E. It covers two vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S). 

 Actually, let me use ""CRANE"". It's a standard choice.

 But note: the example given by the problem used ""STORM"" and then ""BRAVE"", which are not optimal starters. Since we are playing optimally, we choose a word with high-frequency letters.

 According to various analyses, one of the best starting words is ""ROATE"" (which is not common) but we can stick with more common ones.

 Since this is our first guess, any word that gives a lot of information is good.

 Let me choose ""SLATE"":
   S, L, A, T, E

 However, to be different, let's pick ""CRATE"".

 Alternatively, I notice that the example used words starting with ""S"" and then ""B"", so let's avoid being biased.

 Decision: I will choose ""RAISE"" because it contains A, E (vowels) and R, S (common consonants). It also includes I (another vowel).

 But if we are to choose a word without duplicate letters, ""RAISE"" is perfect.

 So, first guess: RAISE

 We'll write: <guess>RAISE</guess>I am making my first guess in this word-guessing game. Since I have no prior feedback, I need a strategic starting word that maximizes information. A good opening word should include common vowels and consonants to test multiple frequent letters. ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:

- It contains **three vowels (A, I, E)**, increasing the chance of revealing vowel positions.
- It includes **common consonants (R, S)**, which often appear in English words.
- All letters are distinct, ensuring I test five unique characters.

This word covers 40% of the vowels and provides high-frequency consonants. Based on common Wordle strategies, ""RAISE"" yields broad insights about the secret word through feedback.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R → (-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 1.
  A → (-) meaning A is in the word but not in position 2.
  I → (x) meaning I is not in the word at all.
  S → (x) meaning S is not in the word.
  E → (x) meaning E is not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains R and A, but neither is in the correct position from the first guess.
- The secret word does not contain I, S, E.

Also, since R is in the word but not in position 1, and A is in the word but not in position 2, we must place them in different positions.

We are to make the second guess.

Constraints:
- The secret word is 5 letters long.
- It contains R and A, and does not contain I, S, E.
- The word must be a valid English word.

We must consider the positions:
- R cannot be in position 1 (since it was in position 1 in RAISE and got ""-"", meaning it's present but wrong position).
- A cannot be in position 2.

Additionally, we may try to include other common letters to test for presence.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the ones we know are not in the word (I, S, E). Also, we know that the word has R and A.

We can consider other vowels: O, U are vowels left. Consonants: Many, but avoid S,E,I.

Since we have two known letters (R and A) that must be in different positions, we can try placing them in possible positions.

Let's think about the possible positions for R and A:

R was in position 1, so it must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5.
A was in position 2, so it must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5.

But note: the secret word must have R and A, and they are not in the same position as before.

Also, the word cannot have I, S, E.

What are common words that contain R and A, and exclude I,S,E?

We can try to form words that place R and A in positions other than 1 and 2 respectively.

For example, let's try placing A in position 1 and R in position 3? But note, if A is in position 1, that is acceptable because in the first guess A was in position 2 and was wrong. But now position 1 is open.

Similarly, R can go in other positions.

We also want to test new letters. Common letters to test: T, N, L, O, U, C, D, M, P, etc.

Since we have few known letters, we should maximize information by using a word that introduces new common letters and places R and A in incorrect positions.

Let me list possible positions for the second guess:

- Position 1: Cannot be R (from first guess position). Also cannot be A if we think it might be, but we have no restriction on A for position 1? Actually, we only know that A is not in position 2. So it can be in 1,3,4,5.
We can try A in position 1? But let's see.

Alternatively, we can avoid position 1 for A because we don't know yet, but it is allowed.

Possible guess: Let's try ""AUDIO""? But we know that I is not in the word, so we shouldn't reuse I. And also E and S are out. So ""AUDIO"" has I and O and U and D. But we know I isn't in the word, so it's wasteful to use I.

We should avoid letters we know are absent: I,S,E.

So let's consider a word without I,S,E and that includes R and A.

Also, since we are in second guess, we can aim to cover many new letters.

Possible words: 
- Having A and R: but placed in positions that are not 1 and not 2? Or we can reposition.

For instance, if we put A in position 1? Then we must put R in a position that is not 1 (which is automatic) and also not the position it was (so avoid 1) but also we only know it cannot be in 1. Actually R must be in 2,3,4,5. But we must be careful: the feedback for R was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 1. Same for A: not in position 2.

So if we put A in position 1, that's allowed because the first guess had A in position 2. Similarly, R in position 2 is allowed? Because the first guess had R in position 1, so position 2 is different. But we don't know if R is in position 2 until we try.

So we can try a word that has A in position 1 and R somewhere else? But we also want to test new letters.

Another idea: use a word that places R somewhere else and A somewhere else, and includes other common letters.

Common letters we haven't tested: T, O, L, N, etc.

Let me try to form a word:

Option 1: ""A"" at position 1, and R at position 3? Then we can have letters in between.

Word: A _ R _ _

But without I,S,E.

Example: ""CARTY""? Not a word. ""PARTY""? But that has P,A,R,T,Y. However, P and T are new. ""PARTY"": 
- P at position 1? We are considering A at position 1? So if we put A at 1, then we cannot put R at the same position? So we need a word starting with A.

Word: ""ALARM""? But we know A is in the word, but in our word we can put A at 1? And R at 4 or 5? Let's see: ""ALARM"": A at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Duplicate A? But the word ""alarm"" has two A's. But in the feedback, we don't know about multiple letters. We must be cautious.

But our first guess had only one A? And the feedback for A was ""-"", meaning there's at least one A. But the word might have more? However, we don't know.

But we should avoid using duplicate letters for now unless necessary? But we can try.

Another word: ""ADORN""? But has O, R, N, D, A? Positions: A at 1, R at 3? But ""ADORN"" is A-D-O-R-N. Position of R is 4? Actually: 
A (position1), D(2), O(3), R(4), N(5). 
So A is at 1 (which is allowed because it's not position2) and R is at 4 (allowed because it's not position1).

Also, no I,S,E.

But note, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it can be in multiple positions? But that's okay.

But also, we are introducing D,O,N.

Another common word: ""ROBOT""? But R at position1? But we know R is present but cannot be at position1? So if we use ""ROBOT"", we put R at position1, which would be invalid? Because the previous feedback said that R is not at position1. So we cannot place R at position1 in any subsequent guess? Actually, we are allowed to guess any word, but logically, since we know R is not at position1, we shouldn't put it there again to save a guess.

Therefore, we must avoid position1 for R.

Similarly, avoid position2 for A.

So words:
- Position1: cannot be R (if we put R it would be a waste, we know it's wrong). It can be A or other letters.

Now, consider ""A____"" words? Then A is at position1.

But we must put R in a position other than 1? Probably positions 2,3,4,5.

But note: if we put R at position2? That is acceptable? Because first word had R at1, so position2 is new. Similarly, A at position1 is new (since it was at2).

We can try ""AUDIO"" but without I? We must skip I. So not.

Word: ""ABOUT"": A at1, B at2, O at3, U at4, T at5? But we don't know if B,O,U,T are in the word? And we need to incorporate R? Wait, ""ABOUT"" doesn't have R? But we know R must be in the word. So we cannot skip R? Because if we don't include R, then we might miss the chance to locate its position.

We must include R and A in our guess? Because we know they are in the word? Actually, it's not mandatory. We could skip R or A to test more letters? But then we won't get information about R and A's positions? We could, but since we know they are present, we might as well include them to get positional data.

So ideally, we include both R and A.

Also, avoid positions: R not in1, A not in2.

So a word that has R and A, with R not in1 and A not in2.

Possible structures:

- R in position2? Then A in positions3,4,5? But A cannot be in2? Wait, if we put R in2, then A can be in 3,4,5? or in1? Yes A can be in1.

But let's avoid A in2? The rule: A is in the word but not in position2. So we can put A in position1? Or other positions.

Alternatively, R can be in position3? Then A can be in position1? Or 4 or 5.

For example: 
- Let A be at1? Then R at3: A _ R _ _
Example words: ""PARTY"" (P is not common? ...), ""CARDS""? But has S? S is forbidden? Because S is out? But we don't have S in the word? Wait, ""CARDS"" has S? So invalid? We must guess without S,E,I.

""CARDS"": C,A,R,D,S → with S? Not allowed because S is absent? So we can only use letters we haven't ruled out? Actually, we can guess any word, but if a letter is not in the secret word, we might waste a slot. So best avoid known absent letters.

Therefore, avoid S,E,I.

So for A1 and R3: Words? ""CARTY"" not a word. ""BARED"" has E? E is absent. ""FARED"" has E? E absent.

Without E: ""MARVY""? Not common. How about ""HARDY""? H at1, A at2? Wait, A at position2? We cannot put A at position2 because we know A is not in position2? So ""HARDY"" has A at2? Which would be the same as before? And since we know A is not at2, if we guess A at2, it would be shown as ""-"" again? But that provides no new information? Or so, it would reconfirm? But we can do better.

To maximize information, we should avoid placing A at2.

Similarly, avoid R at1.

So A1 and R3: Let's think of words: ""LABOR""? But L at2, A at not 1? In ""LABOR"": L1,A2,B3,O4,R5 → A is at2? Which is not allowed? We cannot put A at2 because it was already incorrect? We can put A at2, but if we do, the feedback will again say ""-"" for A? Because it's still not correct (unless the secret word has A at2? But we know it doesn't? Actually, we know that A is in the word but not at position2? So if we put A at2 again, it will be wrong again? And we get ""-"" again? So it doesn't help us to locate A? We should put A in a new position: position1,3,4,5.

Similarly for R: must avoid position1? So position2,3,4,5.

Therefore, for our guess, we should try A in position 1? Then R in position 3? That way we potentially learn about A at1 and R at3.

So find word: A at1, R at3? And without I,S,E.

Possible options:
- ""PARKY"": not common? Or ""TAROK""? Also rare.
- ""MANOR""? M1,A2? But A at2 invalid? We avoid A at2? So positions: A at1, M at2? Then R at3: so A1,M2,R3. Then two more letters? ""MANOR"": A is at2? No: M-A-N-O-R? M1, A2? But we want A at1? So not.
- ""A"" at1, then R at3: so A--R-
Words: ""AIRCY""? Not. ""AIRTH""? Not. With no I: ""ALARM""? But ""ALARM"": A1, L2, A3? Duplicate A? Then R at4? So position3 has A? Which is not in the known positions? But we are including A twice? Which might cause issues? If the letter A appears only once, then the feedback might be messy? But let's avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""ADORE""? But E is absent? So no.

""ABHOR"": A1,B2,H3,O4,R5. That works? R at position5? Not at3? So we don't have R at3? But we need R? And we have R at5? That's okay? Position5 is fine? Because it was position1 before? So different.

""ABHOR"": A1,B2,H3,O4,R5.

But we know E is absent? Yes.

We could use ""ABORT""? But O and R T? A1,B2,O3,R4,T5? But R at4? That's fine.

Also common word.

But note: both avoid duplicate letters and include R and A in positions: A not in2? A is at1? Okay. R not in1? R at4 or 5? Okay.

Another word: ""RADAR""? Has R at1? But we cannot put R at1? Because we know it's not there? Also has two R's? And two A's? Complicated? Avoid.

Better: ""ABOUT"" is popular, but no R? So skip.

Since we want to cover many letters, choose ""ABHOR"" or ""ABORT"".

But ""ABHOR"" is less common? We want valid English words.

""ABORT"" is common: meaning to terminate. So A1, B2, O3, R4, T5.

This includes:
- A at1: if correct, we get ✓ for A? Because A is in the word, and position1.
- B2: unknown
- O3: unknown
- R4: R is in the word, if at position4? Currently trying position4? Previously at1? So different.
- T5: unknown

We introduce B,O,T? Then we can get feedback on them.

Alternatively, another common word: ""ROUTE""? But R at1? Avoid R at1? Cannot.

""TRAIN""? But has I? I is absent? Cannot.

""PLANT""? P L A N T? But A is at position3? Which is valid? Positions: P1, L2, A3, N4, T5? Then R is missing? We haven't included R? So we don't get information about R? But we know R is in the word? So we might not locate it? But we are testing other letters.

But we could: then if we get feedback on A? We already know A is present, and by putting at position3, we may get more?

Also, if we omit R, we can get confirmation that R is still there? Actually, by including R, we get position feedback? Better to include.

So I think including both A and R is better.

Therefore, ""ABORT"": A1,B2,O3,R4,T5.

Word: ABORT.

Now, let me confirm the letters to avoid: I,S,E not present? ABORT has A,B,O,R,T? None of these are I,S,E? Good.

We will see:
- If A is at position1, we get ✓ for A? Or if not, but A is present, we might get ""-""?
  Because we know A is in the word? If the secret word has A at1, then A would be correct? If not, then A is elsewhere? So we are testing position1 for A.
- Similarly, R at position4? Testing that.

Also B,O,T are new.

Second option: ""GARTH""? G1,A2? But A at2? We know A is not at2? So avoid? Also not common.

""YARNS""? Y1,A2? Avoid.

So ""ABORT"" seems good.

Another word: ""ACTOR""? A1,C2,T3,O4,R5? R at5? Then includes C,T,O? Also valid.

Similar? Or ""ABHOR"" as before: A1,B2,H3,O4,R5. H is less common.

So choose between ABORT and ACTOR.

ABORT: A,B,O,R,T
ACTOR: A,C,T,O,R → same letters essentially? But different positions: R in ABORT at4, in ACTOR at5? 

We don't know which is better? Both are common.

I'll pick ABORT because it's a bit more common? Or ACTOR is also common.

But ACTOR has the letter C? Which is less common than B? Actually, both B and C are not too common? But let's not worry.

Alternatively, since the first feedback had R in the first guess at position1? So R was at1? Then putting R at4 or5 might be a good test.

I think ABORT is fine.

So second guess: ABORT

In response format: we output the word.

But think step by step.

Conclusion: 
- We must include R and A? Well, not mandatory? But we know they are present? Including them helps to find their positions? Also, avoids wasting a guess? We would know if the position is correct.

Therefore, guess ""ABORT"".

<guess>ABORT</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback
From the first guess ""RAISE"":
- **R** was marked `-`: It is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- **A** was marked `-`: It is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- **I**, **S**, and **E** were marked `x`: These letters are **not** in the secret word.

### Key Insights:
1. **R and A are present**: Both must appear in the secret word, but R cannot be in position 1, and A cannot be in position 2.
2. **Excluded letters**: Avoid using I, S, or E in future guesses, as they are not in the word.
3. **Strategy for second guess**: 
   - Prioritize words that include **R and A** to test new positions.
   - Place R in a position other than 1 (e.g., 2, 3, 4, or 5) and A in a position other than 2 (e.g., 1, 3, 4, or 5).
   - Maximize new information by including high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, O, B, N) and vowels (e.g., O, U), avoiding excluded letters.
   - Avoid repeating the positions from the first guess: R cannot be guessed at position 1, and A cannot be guessed at position 2.

### Why Guess ""ABORT""?
- **Positions**: Places A at position 1 (new position to test) and R at position 4 (different from position 1).
- **Included letters**: Introduces **B**, **O**, and **T**, common consonants not yet tested.
- **Excluded letters**: Avoids I, S, E (all ruled out).
- **Word validity**: ""ABORT"" is a valid English word (5 letters).

### Expected Outcomes:
- If A is in position 1, it will be marked `✓`; otherwise, `-` (since A is present).
- If R is in position 4, it will be marked `✓`; otherwise, `-`.
- Feedback on B, O, and T will reveal if they are in the word and/or in the correct positions.

Actually, we can guess any word, but if a letter is not in the secret word, we might waste a slot. So best avoid known absent letters.\n\nTherefore, avoid S,E,I.\n\nSo for A1 and R3: Words? ""CARTY"" not a word. ""BARED"" has E? E is absent. ""FARED"" has E? E absent.\n\nWithout E: ""MARVY""? Not common. How about ""HARDY""? H at1, A at2? Wait, A at position2? We cannot put A at position2 because we know A is not in position2? So ""HARDY"" has A at2? Which would be the same as before? And since we know A is not at2, if we guess A at2, it would be shown as ""-"" again? But that provides no new information? Or so, it would reconfirm? But we can do better.\n\nTo maximize information, we should avoid placing A at2.\n\nSimilarly, avoid R at1.\n\nSo A1 and R3: Let\'s think of words: ""LABOR""? But L at2, A at not 1? In ""LABOR"": L1,A2,B3,O4,R5 → A is at2? Which is not allowed? We cannot put A at2 because it was already incorrect? We can put A at2, but if we do, the feedback will again say ""-"" for A? Because it\'s still not correct (unless the secret word has A at2? But we know it doesn\'t? Actually, we know that A is in the word but not at position2? So if we put A at2 again, it will be wrong again? And we get ""-"" again? So it doesn\'t help us to locate A? We should put A in a new position: position1,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly for R: must avoid position1? So position2,3,4,5.\n\nTherefore, for our guess, we should try A in position 1? Then R in position 3? That way we potentially learn about A at1 and R at3.\n\nSo find word: A at1, R at3? And without I,S,E.\n\nPossible options:\n- ""PARKY"": not common? Or ""TAROK""? Also rare.\n- ""MANOR""? M1,A2? But A at2 invalid? We avoid A at2? So positions: A at1, M at2? Then R at3: so A1,M2,R3. Then two more letters? ""MANOR"": A is at2? No: M-A-N-O-R? M1, A2? But we want A at1? So not.\n- ""A"" at1, then R at3: so A--R-\nWords: ""AIRCY""? Not. ""AIRTH""? Not. With no I: ""ALARM""? But ""ALARM"": A1, L2, A3? Duplicate A? Then R at4? So position3 has A? Which is not in the known positions? But we are including A twice? Which might cause issues? If the letter A appears only once, then the feedback might be messy? But let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\nAnother word: ""ADORE""? But E is absent? So no.\n\n""ABHOR"": A1,B2,H3,O4,R5. That works? R at position5? Not at3? So we don\'t have R at3? But we need R? And we have R at5? That\'s okay? Position5 is fine? Because it was position1 before? So different.\n\n""ABHOR"": A1,B2,H3,O4,R5.\n\nBut we know E is absent? Yes.\n\nWe could use ""ABORT""? But O and R T? A1,B2,O3,R4,T5? But R at4? That\'s fine.\n\nAlso common word.\n\nBut note: both avoid duplicate letters and include R and A in positions: A not in2? A is at1? Okay. R not in1? R at4 or 5? Okay.\n\nAnother word: ""RADAR""? Has R at1? But we cannot put R at1? Because we know it\'s not there? Also has two R\'s? And two A\'s? Complicated? Avoid.\n\nBetter: ""ABOUT"" is popular, but no R? So skip.\n\nSince we want to cover many letters, choose ""ABHOR"" or ""ABORT"".\n\nBut ""ABHOR"" is less common? We want valid English words.\n\n""ABORT"" is common: meaning to terminate. So A1, B2, O3, R4, T5.\n\nThis includes:\n- A at1: if correct, we get ✓ for A? Because A is in the word, and position1.\n- B2: unknown\n- O3: unknown\n- R4: R is in the word, if at position4? Currently trying position4? Previously at1? So different.\n- T5: unknown\n\nWe introduce B,O,T? Then we can get feedback on them.\n\nAlternatively, another common word: ""ROUTE""? But R at1? Avoid R at1? Cannot.\n\n""TRAIN""? But has I? I is absent? Cannot.\n\n""PLANT""? P L A N T? But A is at position3? Which is valid? Positions: P1, L2, A3, N4, T5? Then R is missing? We haven\'t included R? So we don\'t get information about R? But we know R is in the word? So we might not locate it? But we are testing other letters.\n\nBut we could: then if we get feedback on A? We already know A is present, and by putting at position3, we may get more?\n\nAlso, if we omit R, we can get confirmation that R is still there? Actually, by including R, we get position feedback? Better to include.\n\nSo I think including both A and R is better.\n\nTherefore, ""ABORT"": A1,B2,O3,R4,T5.\n\nWord: ABORT.\n\nNow, let me confirm the letters to avoid: I,S,E not present? ABORT has A,B,O,R,T? None of these are I,S,E? Good.\n\nWe will see:\n- If A is at position1, we get ✓ for A? Or if not, but A is present, we might get ""-""?\n  Because we know A is in the word? If the secret word has A at1, then A would be correct? If not, then A is elsewhere? So we are testing position1 for A.\n- Similarly, R at position4? Testing that.\n\nAlso B,O,T are new.\n\nSecond option: ""GARTH""? G1,A2? But A at2? We know A is not at2? So avoid? Also not common.\n\n""YARNS""? Y1,A2? Avoid.\n\nSo ""ABORT"" seems good.\n\nAnother word: ""ACTOR""? A1,C2,T3,O4,R5? R at5? Then includes C,T,O? Also valid.\n\nSimilar? Or ""ABHOR"" as before: A1,B2,H3,O4,R5. H is less common.\n\nSo choose between ABORT and ACTOR.\n\nABORT: A,B,O,R,T\nACTOR: A,C,T,O,R → same letters essentially? But different positions: R in ABORT at4, in ACTOR at5? \n\nWe don\'t know which is better? Both are common.\n\nI\'ll pick ABORT because it\'s a bit more common? Or ACTOR is also common.\n\nBut ACTOR has the letter C? Which is less common than B? Actually, both B and C are not too common? But let\'s not worry.\n\nAlternatively, since the first feedback had R in the first guess at position1? So R was at1? Then putting R at4 or5 might be a good test.\n\nI think ABORT is fine.\n\nSo second guess: ABORT\n\nIn response format: we output the word.\n\nBut think step by step.\n\nConclusion: \n- We must include R and A? Well, not mandatory? But we know they are present? Including them helps to find their positions? Also, avoids wasting a guess? We would know if the position is correct.\n\nTherefore, guess ""ABORT"".\n\n<guess>ABORT</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\nFrom the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- **R** was marked `-`: It is in the secret word but not in position 1.\n- **A** was marked `-`: It is in the secret word but not in position 2.\n- **I**, **S**, and **E** were marked `x`: These letters are **not** in the secret word.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **R and A are present**: Both must appear in the secret word, but R cannot be in position 1, and A cannot be in position 2.\n2. **Excluded letters**: Avoid using I, S, or E in future guesses, as they are not in the word.\n3. **Strategy for second guess**: \n   - Prioritize words that include **R and A** to test new positions.\n   - Place R in a position other than 1 (e.g., 2, 3, 4, or 5) and A in a position other than 2 (e.g., 1, 3, 4, or 5).\n   - Maximize new information by including high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, O, B, N) and vowels (e.g., O, U), avoiding excluded letters.\n   - Avoid repeating the positions from the first guess: R cannot be guessed at position 1, and A cannot be guessed at position 2.\n\n### Why Guess ""ABORT""?\n- **Positions**: Places A at position 1 (new position to test) and R at position 4 (different from position 1).\n- **Included letters**: Introduces **B**, **O**, and **T**, common consonants not yet tested.\n- **Excluded letters**: Avoids I, S, E (all ruled out).\n- **Word validity**: ""ABORT"" is a valid English word (5 letters).\n\n### Expected Outcomes:\n- If A is in position 1, it will be marked `✓`; otherwise, `-` (since A is present).\n- If R is in position 4, it will be marked `✓`; otherwise, `-`.\n- Feedback on B, O, and T will reveal if they are in the word and/or in the correct positions.\n\n<guess>ABORT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ABORT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(✓) R(-) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the second guess ""ABORT"":
  A → (-) meaning A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1).
  B → (x) meaning B is not in the word.
  O → (✓) meaning O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in ABORT, O is at position 3).
  R → (-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 4 (since we placed it at position 4).
  T → (x) meaning T is not in the word.

So, combining with the first guess:
- The secret word contains: R, A, O (and we know O is at position 3).
- The secret word does not contain: I, S, E, B, T.
- Also, from positions:
  - A is not in position 1 or 2 (from first guess A was at 2, now at 1, both gave '-', so A is not at 1 or 2).
  - R is not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess).
  - O is fixed at position 3.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ O _ _

And we know:
- A must be in one of positions 3,4,5? But position 3 is O, so A cannot be at 3? Because O is fixed at 3? So A must be in position 4 or 5? 
  Actually, position 3 is taken by O, so A can only be at 4 or 5? But we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is O, so A can be at 4 or 5? But we also know A is not at 1 or 2? So yes, A must be at 4 or 5.

Similarly, R is not at 1 or 4? So R must be at 2,3, or 5? But position 3 is O, so R cannot be at 3? Therefore, R must be at 2 or 5.

But note: position 5 might be taken by A or R? Or both? But we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But so far, we haven't seen duplicates? We should consider the possibility? But let's assume no duplicates for now? Because we haven't encountered any.

So, the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily? But we can try to avoid duplicates until forced.

So, positions:
- Position 3: O (fixed)
- A must be at 4 or 5.
- R must be at 2 or 5.

But if R is at 5, then A cannot be at 5? So if R is at 5, A must be at 4? Similarly, if R is at 2, then A can be at 4 or 5? But if A is at 5, then R at 2? Or if A is at 4, then R at 2? Or if R is at 5, then A at 4.

So two main cases:
Case 1: R at position 2, then A at position 4 or 5.
Case 2: R at position 5, then A at position 4.

Also, we need to fill position 1? And the remaining position (if A is at 4, then position 5 is open? Or if A at 5, then position 4 is open?).

But we also know the word does not contain: I,S,E,B,T.

We need to choose a word that tests these possibilities.

We can try to cover both cases? Or focus on one? But we need to find the word.

We know the word has O at 3, and must have A and R in the remaining positions.

We can try to form words that fit.

First, what letters are available? We have 26 letters minus excluded: I,S,E,B,T. So we cannot use these.

Also, we have used: R,A,O (which are in the word), and B,T (not in word). Also from first guess: I,S,E not in word.

So available letters: C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we need common letters? And form a valid word.

Now, for the third guess, we can try to test the positions of A and R.

For example, if we assume R is at position 2? Then the word is: _ R O _ _

And A must be at 4 or 5.

Similarly, if R is at 5? Then word is: _ _ O _ R, and A at 4.

We can try to cover one of these cases? Or we can choose a word that has R at 2 and A at 4? Or R at 2 and A at 5? Etc.

But we don't know? So we need to test.

We can also try to include new letters to get more information.

Let me list possible words:

First, if we put R at position 2? Then we have: _ R O _ _

And A at 4: then word: _ R O A _
Or A at 5: _ R O _ A

Similarly, if we put R at 5? Then: _ _ O A R (since A must be at 4).

But we don't know which? So we can choose a word that tests R at 2? Or R at 5? Or both?

But we can only do one guess.

We can also consider the position of A? For example, if we put A at position 4? Then we can see if it is correct? And also test R at 2 or 5.

But we have to choose a word that fits the constraints.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: Assume R at 2 and A at 4: then word: ? R O A ?

We need to fill position 1 and 5? With letters not in {I,S,E,B,T} and not A,O,R (if distinct).

Position 1: can be any available letter? But must form a word.

For example: C R O A ? -> ""CROAK""? But K is not excluded? And ""CROAK"" is a word? C R O A K.

But we have K? And we haven't tested K? Also, is K allowed? Yes, not excluded.

But we have A at 4? And O at 3? R at 2? Then position 5: K.

But we don't know if K is in the word? We can try.

But we are not sure if R is at 2? Or A at 4? So if we guess ""CROAK"", then:

- If the secret word is CROAK, we win? But let's see the feedback we would get? But we don't know.

But we are guessing to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at 5? For example, if we put A at 4 and R at 5: then word: ? ? O A R

For example: ""FLOAR""? Not a word. ""GLOAR""? Not. ""DOZAR""? Not. ""MORAR""? Not common? ""VOTAR""? Not.

Common words: ""ROTAR""? Not. ""POLAR""? P O L A R? But O is at position 2? In ""POLAR"": P1, O2, L3, A4, R5? But we need O at position 3? So not.

We need O at position 3? So the word must have O at 3.

So for R at 5 and A at 4: the word is: _ _ O A R

Now, what words have this pattern? With O at 3, A at 4, R at 5? And the first two letters from available set.

Examples: 
- ""CHAOR""? Not a word.
- ""FLAOR""? Not.
- ""DEVAR""? Not.
- ""JUDAR""? Not.
- ""POKAR""? Not.
- ""COVAR""? Not.
- ""MOLAR""? M1, O2? But we need O at 3? Not.

Actually, ""MOLAR"" has O at 2? Not at 3.

What about ""FOCAL""? F O C A L? O at 2? Not.

We need O at 3: so the pattern is: letter1, letter2, O, A, R.

Words: 
- ""CHOAR""? Not.
- ""BLOAR""? Not.
- ""GLOAR""? Not.
- ""DROAR""? Not.
- ""CROAR""? Not.

Perhaps ""MORAY""? But that has Y? And pattern: M1, O2, R3, A4, Y5? Not O at 3.

I think there are few common words with O at 3 and A at 4 and R at 5? 

Another: ""BOARD""? But O at 2? Not.

""HOARD"": H1, O2, A3, R4, D5? Not O at 3.

It seems difficult? So maybe the case with R at 5 and A at 4 is rare? Or not common.

Perhaps ""LORAN""? L1, O2, R3, A4, N5? But O at 2? Not.

We need O at position 3? So the word must be: ? ? O ? ?

With A and R at 4 and 5? Or one at 4 and one at 5? But in the case R at 5 and A at 4, it's ? ? O A R.

But I cannot find a common word? So maybe that case is less likely? Or we need to consider A at 5 and R at 2? Or A at 4 and R at 2.

So let's go back to the case with R at 2: then word: _ R O _ _

With A at 4: then _ R O A _
Or A at 5: _ R O _ A

Now, for _ R O A _ : we need to fill position 1 and 5? With letters not excluded.

Position 1: can be C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But must form a word.

Examples:
- C R O A K -> ""CROAK"" (valid)
- D R O A M? But M at 5? ""DROAM"" not a word? ""DROME""? Not. ""DROID""? Has I? I excluded.
- F R O A M? ""FROAM"" not? ""FROWN""? F R O W N? But then A is not at 4? We are assuming A at 4? So in ""FROWN"", it's F R O W N, no A? So not.

But we are constructing a word with A at 4? So the fourth letter must be A.

So for _ R O A _ : 
- Position 1: ? 
- Position 5: ?

Words: 
- ""CROAK"" (C at1, K at5)
- ""GROAN"" (G at1, N at5)
- ""PROAN""? Not a word.
- ""DROAN""? Not.
- ""FROAN""? Not.
- ""CROAN""? Not.
- ""BROAD""? B at1, D at5? But B is excluded? We know B is not in the word? So cannot use B? ""BROAD"" has B? So invalid? Because B is absent? So we cannot use B.

Similarly, ""CROAK"" is C,R,O,A,K? C and K are not excluded? So valid.

""GROAN"": G,R,O,A,N? G and N not excluded? Valid.

""PROWL""? But no A? Not.

""TROAK""? Not common? Or ""TROAD""? Not.

So possible: ""CROAK"" and ""GROAN"".

Now, for the other subcase: R at 2, A at 5: then word: _ R O _ A

Examples:
- C R O M A? ""CROMA"" not? ""CHROMA""? C H R O M A? 6 letters? No, 5: C-H-R-O-M? But O at 4? Not at 3? We need O at 3? So pattern: _ R O _ A

So: position1, R, O, position4, A.

Words:
- ""PROA""? 4 letters? Not 5.
- ""GROAT"": G R O A T? But T is excluded? We know T is not in the word? So ""GROAT"" has T? Invalid.
- ""CROAT"": C R O A T? T excluded? Invalid.
- ""DROPA""? Not a word.
- ""FROLA""? Not.
- ""KROMA""? Not.

So it seems difficult to find a common word with R at 2, O at 3, and A at 5? Because the only common pattern is with A at 4? Like ""CROAK"", ""GROAN"", etc.

Therefore, the most likely is R at 2 and A at 4? With words like ""CROAK"" or ""GROAN"".

But we also have the possibility of R at 5? But we couldn't find a common word? So maybe R at 5 is less likely? Or we missed a word.

What about ""MORAL""? M O R A L? But O at 2? Not at 3.

""ORGAN"": O1, R2, G3, A4, N5? But O at 1? Not at 3.

We need O at 3? So the word must have the third letter O.

Another idea: perhaps A is at 5 and R at 2? But we need a word: _ R O ? A

For example, ""FROZEN""? 6 letters? ""FROSH""? Has S? S excluded? ""FROTH""? T excluded? ""FROWN""? No A? ""CROON""? No A? ""DROOL""? No A? ""PROWL""? No A? ""GROWL""? No A? ""CROWD""? No A? ""CROFT""? T excluded? ""CROOK""? No A? ""BROOK""? B excluded? ""GROOM""? No A? ""GROIN""? I excluded? ""CROON""? No A? ""DROOP""? No A? ""TROOP""? T excluded? ""TROUT""? T excluded? ""GROUP""? No A? ""TROAK""? Not common? ""VROOM""? No A? ""WRONG""? No A? ""PRONG""? No A? ""CRONY""? No A? ""IRONY""? I excluded? ""CRONE""? E excluded? ""DRONE""? E excluded? ""PRONE""? E excluded? ""TRONE""? T excluded? ""GRACE""? E excluded? ""TRACE""? T excluded? ""CRANE""? E excluded? ""CRATE""? E excluded? ""GRATE""? E excluded? ""PRICE""? I excluded? ""PRIDE""? E excluded? ""CRIME""? I excluded? ""GRIME""? E excluded? ""DROVE""? E excluded? ""GROVE""? E excluded? ""PROVE""? E excluded? ""TROVE""? T and E excluded? ""BROKE""? B and E excluded? ""CRAKE""? E excluded? ""DRAKE""? E excluded? ""FLAKE""? E excluded? ""BRAKE""? B and E excluded? ""CROZE""? E? Not common? ""CROME""? Not? ""DROME""? E? Not? ""GROPE""? E excluded? ""GRAPE""? E excluded? ""CRAPE""? E excluded? ""TRAPE""? Not? ""GROAN"" we have? But that has A at 4? Not at 5.

I think it's hard to find a word with A at 5? So probably A is at 4? And R at 2? So the word is _ R O A _

With the first letter to be determined? And the last letter? From available letters.

We have two candidates: ""CROAK"" and ""GROAN"".

But we also have the possibility that R is at 5? But we couldn't find a common word? So let's assume R is at 2? And A at 4? Then we can guess one of these? But which one?

We can choose a word that tests more letters? Or we can choose one that covers both possibilities? But we have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't assume R at 2? But tests the position of R and A? For example, we can put R at 5 and A at 4? But we need a valid word? Or we can put R at 2 and A at 5? But we couldn't find one.

Another idea: we can put A at 4? And R at a different position? But we know R must be at 2 or 5? And we are trying to test.

We can guess a word that has A at 4? And R at 5? But we need a word with O at 3? And A at 4? R at 5? And the first two letters? We couldn't find? But let's try ""DOZAR""? Not? ""FOYAR""? Not? ""HOYAR""? Not? ""KOJAR""? Not? ""MOJAR""? Not? ""NOYAR""? Not? ""POJAR""? Not? ""ROYAR""? Not? ""SOJAR""? S excluded? ""TOJAR""? T excluded? ""VOJAR""? Not? ""WOJAR""? Not? ""YOKAR""? Not? ""ZORAK""? Not? ""KORAT""? T excluded? ""MORAT""? Not? ""NORAT""? Not? ""PORAT""? Not? ""SORAT""? S excluded? ""TORAT""? T excluded? ""VORAT""? Not? ""WORAT""? Not? ""YORAK""? Not? ""ZORAK""? Not? ""CORAL""? But O at 2? Not at 3? ""CORAL"": C1,O2,R3,A4,L5? But we need O at 3? So not.

Perhaps ""AORTA""? But A at 1? And O at 2? Not at 3? ""AORTA"": A1,O2,R3,T4,A5? But T excluded? And O at 2? Not.

I think it's safe to assume that R is at 2? And A at 4? So the word is _ R O A _

Now, for the third guess, we can guess ""CROAK"" or ""GROAN""? But we have to choose one.

We can also guess a word that has different letters to test? For example, if we guess ""CROAK"", we test C and K? If we guess ""GROAN"", we test G and N.

We don't know which? So we can choose based on letter frequency? Or arbitrarily.

But we have position 1 and 5 to fill? With letters not excluded.

Also, we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Let me list the frequency: common letters left: L, N, D, C, M, P, U, etc.

But we can choose ""GROAN"" because G and N are common? Or ""CROAK"" with C and K? K is less common.

So ""GROAN"" might be better? But let's see.

Another word: ""PROAM""? Not? ""DROAM""? Not? ""FROAM""? Not? ""PROMO""? No A? ""PRONA""? Not? ""CRENA""? E excluded? ""DRAMA""? But A at 4 and 5? Duplicate? And M? But ""DRAMA"": D1,R2,A3,M4,A5? But we need O at 3? Not A? So not.

So only ""CROAK"" and ""GROAN"" seem valid? And ""GROAN"" has G and N? Which are more common than C and K? But C is also common.

But let's consider: if we guess ""GROAN"", then:
- If the secret word is ""GROAN"", we win? But if not, we get feedback on G and N.

Similarly for ""CROAK"".

But we have another possibility: what if R is at 5? And A at 4? But we couldn't find a word? So maybe it's not? Or we missed ""MORAY""? But ""MORAY"" has O at 2? Not.

""OCTAR""? Not? ""OCTAN""? Not? ""OPTAR""? Not? ""OVARY""? O at 1? Not.

I think we should go with ""GROAN"" or ""CROAK"".

But let's choose ""GROAN"" because it has N? Which is very common.

So guess: GROAN

But in ""GROAN"": G1, R2, O3, A4, N5.

Now, let's see what feedback we would get if the secret word is something else? But we don't know.

We can also consider that if we are wrong, we get information.

But we have to make a guess.

So I'll go with ""GROAN"".

But let's double-check the feedback constraints.

From guess 2: O is at position 3? Correct? So in ""GROAN"", O is at 3? Good.

A is at 4? We are testing that.

R is at 2? Testing that.

G and N are new? We will see if they are in the word.

But we know the word has R, A, O? And we are including them? So if G and N are not in the word, we get x for them? And if the positions are wrong for R and A? We get -? Or if correct, ✓.

But if the secret word has R at 5? Then in ""GROAN"", R is at 2? Which is wrong? So we would get R(-)? And A at 4? If the secret word has A at 4? Then A(✓)? Or if not, A(-)? But we think A is at 4? But if the secret word has R at 5 and A at 4? But we couldn't find a word? So maybe not.

Perhaps the secret word is ""GROAN""? Or ""CROAK""? Or another word.

Another word: ""DROWN""? But no A? And T not? ""DROWN"": D R O W N? No A? So not? Because A must be in the word.

Similarly, ""CROWD""? No A.

So I think ""GROAN"" is a good guess.

So third guess: GROAN

### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: RAISE**  
  Feedback: R(-), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)  
  Insights:  
  - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 2, respectively.  
  - I, S, E are absent from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ABORT**  
  Feedback: A(-), B(x), O(✓), R(-), T(x)  
  Insights:  
  - A is in the secret word but not in position 1 (new position tested).  
  - B and T are absent from the secret word.  
  - O is in the secret word and **correctly positioned at 3**.  
  - R is in the secret word but not in position 4.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Secret word structure**: O is fixed at position 3: `_ _ O _ _`.  
2. **Confirmed letters in the word**: R, A, O.  
3. **Excluded letters**: I, S, E, B, T (cannot appear).  
4. **Position constraints for A and R**:  
   - A cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from Guess 1 and 2), so it must be in position 4 or 5.  
   - R cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from Guess 1 and 2), so it must be in position 2 or 5.  
   - Since position 3 is occupied by O, A and R cannot be there.  
5. **Possible scenarios** (assuming no duplicate letters for efficiency):  
   - **Case 1**: R at position 2, A at position 4 (e.g., `_ R O A _`).  
   - **Case 2**: R at position 2, A at position 5 (e.g., `_ R O _ A`).  
   - **Case 3**: R at position 5, A at position 4 (e.g., `_ _ O A R`).  
6. **Case 3 (R at 5, A at 4) is unlikely** due to a lack of common English words fitting `_ _ O A R` (e.g., no valid words like ""MORAR"" or ""FLOAR"").  
7. **Case 2 (R at 2, A at 5) is challenging** due to few valid words (e.g., ""CROAT"" and ""GROAT"" are invalid as they contain T, which is excluded).  
8. **Case 1 (R at 2, A at 4) is most plausible**, with valid words like **GROAN** (G at 1, N at 5) or **CROAK** (C at 1, K at 5).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test Case 1 (R at 2, A at 4)** by guessing **GROAN**.  
  - Why?  
    - Covers R at position 2 and A at position 4, directly testing the most likely scenario.  
    - Introduces new high-frequency letters **G** (position 1) and **N** (position 5) to gather more information.  
    - Avoids excluded letters (I, S, E, B, T).  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If G is correct at position 1, feedback: `✓`; if present but wrong position: `-`; if absent: `x`.  
  - R at position 2: If correct, `✓`; if not (e.g., R is at 5), `-`.  
  - O at position 3: Always `✓` (confirmed).  
  - A at position 4: If correct, `✓`; if not (e.g., A is at 5), `-`.  
  - N at position 5: If correct, `✓`; if present but wrong position: `-`; if absent: `x`.  
- **If GROAN is incorrect**, feedback will resolve ambiguity:  
  - E.g., if R is marked `-`, it suggests R is at position 5 (Case 3).  
  - E.g., if A is marked `-`, it suggests A is at position 5 (Case 2).  

<guess>GROAN</guess>",GROAN,"We have feedback from the second guess ""ABORT"":
  A → (-) meaning A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1).
  B → (x) meaning B is not in the word.
  O → (✓) meaning O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in ABORT, O is at position 3).
  R → (-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 4 (since we placed it at position 4).
  T → (x) meaning T is not in the word.

So, combining with the first guess:
- The secret word contains: R, A, O (and we know O is at position 3).
- The secret word does not contain: I, S, E, B, T.
- Also, from positions:
  - A is not in position 1 or 2 (from first guess A was at 2, now at 1, both gave '-', so A is not at 1 or 2).
  - R is not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess).
  - O is fixed at position 3.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ O _ _

And we know:
- A must be in one of positions 3,4,5? But position 3 is O, so A cannot be at 3? Because O is fixed at 3? So A must be in position 4 or 5? 
  Actually, position 3 is taken by O, so A can only be at 4 or 5? But we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is O, so A can be at 4 or 5? But we also know A is not at 1 or 2? So yes, A must be at 4 or 5.

Similarly, R is not at 1 or 4? So R must be at 2,3, or 5? But position 3 is O, so R cannot be at 3? Therefore, R must be at 2 or 5.

But note: position 5 might be taken by A or R? Or both? But we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But so far, we haven't seen duplicates? We should consider the possibility? But let's assume no duplicates for now? Because we haven't encountered any.

So, the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily? But we can try to avoid duplicates until forced.

So, positions:
- Position 3: O (fixed)
- A must be at 4 or 5.
- R must be at 2 or 5.

But if R is at 5, then A cannot be at 5? So if R is at 5, A must be at 4? Similarly, if R is at 2, then A can be at 4 or 5? But if A is at 5, then R at 2? Or if A is at 4, then R at 2? Or if R is at 5, then A at 4.

So two main cases:
Case 1: R at position 2, then A at position 4 or 5.
Case 2: R at position 5, then A at position 4.

Also, we need to fill position 1? And the remaining position (if A is at 4, then position 5 is open? Or if A at 5, then position 4 is open?).

But we also know the word does not contain: I,S,E,B,T.

We need to choose a word that tests these possibilities.

We can try to cover both cases? Or focus on one? But we need to find the word.

We know the word has O at 3, and must have A and R in the remaining positions.

We can try to form words that fit.

First, what letters are available? We have 26 letters minus excluded: I,S,E,B,T. So we cannot use these.

Also, we have used: R,A,O (which are in the word), and B,T (not in word). Also from first guess: I,S,E not in word.

So available letters: C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we need common letters? And form a valid word.

Now, for the third guess, we can try to test the positions of A and R.

For example, if we assume R is at position 2? Then the word is: _ R O _ _

And A must be at 4 or 5.

Similarly, if R is at 5? Then word is: _ _ O _ R, and A at 4.

We can try to cover one of these cases? Or we can choose a word that has R at 2 and A at 4? Or R at 2 and A at 5? Etc.

But we don't know? So we need to test.

We can also try to include new letters to get more information.

Let me list possible words:

First, if we put R at position 2? Then we have: _ R O _ _

And A at 4: then word: _ R O A _
Or A at 5: _ R O _ A

Similarly, if we put R at 5? Then: _ _ O A R (since A must be at 4).

But we don't know which? So we can choose a word that tests R at 2? Or R at 5? Or both?

But we can only do one guess.

We can also consider the position of A? For example, if we put A at position 4? Then we can see if it is correct? And also test R at 2 or 5.

But we have to choose a word that fits the constraints.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: Assume R at 2 and A at 4: then word: ? R O A ?

We need to fill position 1 and 5? With letters not in {I,S,E,B,T} and not A,O,R (if distinct).

Position 1: can be any available letter? But must form a word.

For example: C R O A ? -> ""CROAK""? But K is not excluded? And ""CROAK"" is a word? C R O A K.

But we have K? And we haven't tested K? Also, is K allowed? Yes, not excluded.

But we have A at 4? And O at 3? R at 2? Then position 5: K.

But we don't know if K is in the word? We can try.

But we are not sure if R is at 2? Or A at 4? So if we guess ""CROAK"", then:

- If the secret word is CROAK, we win? But let's see the feedback we would get? But we don't know.

But we are guessing to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at 5? For example, if we put A at 4 and R at 5: then word: ? ? O A R

For example: ""FLOAR""? Not a word. ""GLOAR""? Not. ""DOZAR""? Not. ""MORAR""? Not common? ""VOTAR""? Not.

Common words: ""ROTAR""? Not. ""POLAR""? P O L A R? But O is at position 2? In ""POLAR"": P1, O2, L3, A4, R5? But we need O at position 3? So not.

We need O at position 3? So the word must have O at 3.

So for R at 5 and A at 4: the word is: _ _ O A R

Now, what words have this pattern? With O at 3, A at 4, R at 5? And the first two letters from available set.

Examples: 
- ""CHAOR""? Not a word.
- ""FLAOR""? Not.
- ""DEVAR""? Not.
- ""JUDAR""? Not.
- ""POKAR""? Not.
- ""COVAR""? Not.
- ""MOLAR""? M1, O2? But we need O at 3? Not.

Actually, ""MOLAR"" has O at 2? Not at 3.

What about ""FOCAL""? F O C A L? O at 2? Not.

We need O at 3: so the pattern is: letter1, letter2, O, A, R.

Words: 
- ""CHOAR""? Not.
- ""BLOAR""? Not.
- ""GLOAR""? Not.
- ""DROAR""? Not.
- ""CROAR""? Not.

Perhaps ""MORAY""? But that has Y? And pattern: M1, O2, R3, A4, Y5? Not O at 3.

I think there are few common words with O at 3 and A at 4 and R at 5? 

Another: ""BOARD""? But O at 2? Not.

""HOARD"": H1, O2, A3, R4, D5? Not O at 3.

It seems difficult? So maybe the case with R at 5 and A at 4 is rare? Or not common.

Perhaps ""LORAN""? L1, O2, R3, A4, N5? But O at 2? Not.

We need O at position 3? So the word must be: ? ? O ? ?

With A and R at 4 and 5? Or one at 4 and one at 5? But in the case R at 5 and A at 4, it's ? ? O A R.

But I cannot find a common word? So maybe that case is less likely? Or we need to consider A at 5 and R at 2? Or A at 4 and R at 2.

So let's go back to the case with R at 2: then word: _ R O _ _

With A at 4: then _ R O A _
Or A at 5: _ R O _ A

Now, for _ R O A _ : we need to fill position 1 and 5? With letters not excluded.

Position 1: can be C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But must form a word.

Examples:
- C R O A K -> ""CROAK"" (valid)
- D R O A M? But M at 5? ""DROAM"" not a word? ""DROME""? Not. ""DROID""? Has I? I excluded.
- F R O A M? ""FROAM"" not? ""FROWN""? F R O W N? But then A is not at 4? We are assuming A at 4? So in ""FROWN"", it's F R O W N, no A? So not.

But we are constructing a word with A at 4? So the fourth letter must be A.

So for _ R O A _ : 
- Position 1: ? 
- Position 5: ?

Words: 
- ""CROAK"" (C at1, K at5)
- ""GROAN"" (G at1, N at5)
- ""PROAN""? Not a word.
- ""DROAN""? Not.
- ""FROAN""? Not.
- ""CROAN""? Not.
- ""BROAD""? B at1, D at5? But B is excluded? We know B is not in the word? So cannot use B? ""BROAD"" has B? So invalid? Because B is absent? So we cannot use B.

Similarly, ""CROAK"" is C,R,O,A,K? C and K are not excluded? So valid.

""GROAN"": G,R,O,A,N? G and N not excluded? Valid.

""PROWL""? But no A? Not.

""TROAK""? Not common? Or ""TROAD""? Not.

So possible: ""CROAK"" and ""GROAN"".

Now, for the other subcase: R at 2, A at 5: then word: _ R O _ A

Examples:
- C R O M A? ""CROMA"" not? ""CHROMA""? C H R O M A? 6 letters? No, 5: C-H-R-O-M? But O at 4? Not at 3? We need O at 3? So pattern: _ R O _ A

So: position1, R, O, position4, A.

Words:
- ""PROA""? 4 letters? Not 5.
- ""GROAT"": G R O A T? But T is excluded? We know T is not in the word? So ""GROAT"" has T? Invalid.
- ""CROAT"": C R O A T? T excluded? Invalid.
- ""DROPA""? Not a word.
- ""FROLA""? Not.
- ""KROMA""? Not.

So it seems difficult to find a common word with R at 2, O at 3, and A at 5? Because the only common pattern is with A at 4? Like ""CROAK"", ""GROAN"", etc.

Therefore, the most likely is R at 2 and A at 4? With words like ""CROAK"" or ""GROAN"".

But we also have the possibility of R at 5? But we couldn't find a common word? So maybe R at 5 is less likely? Or we missed a word.

What about ""MORAL""? M O R A L? But O at 2? Not at 3.

""ORGAN"": O1, R2, G3, A4, N5? But O at 1? Not at 3.

We need O at 3? So the word must have the third letter O.

Another idea: perhaps A is at 5 and R at 2? But we need a word: _ R O ? A

For example, ""FROZEN""? 6 letters? ""FROSH""? Has S? S excluded? ""FROTH""? T excluded? ""FROWN""? No A? ""CROON""? No A? ""DROOL""? No A? ""PROWL""? No A? ""GROWL""? No A? ""CROWD""? No A? ""CROFT""? T excluded? ""CROOK""? No A? ""BROOK""? B excluded? ""GROOM""? No A? ""GROIN""? I excluded? ""CROON""? No A? ""DROOP""? No A? ""TROOP""? T excluded? ""TROUT""? T excluded? ""GROUP""? No A? ""TROAK""? Not common? ""VROOM""? No A? ""WRONG""? No A? ""PRONG""? No A? ""CRONY""? No A? ""IRONY""? I excluded? ""CRONE""? E excluded? ""DRONE""? E excluded? ""PRONE""? E excluded? ""TRONE""? T excluded? ""GRACE""? E excluded? ""TRACE""? T excluded? ""CRANE""? E excluded? ""CRATE""? E excluded? ""GRATE""? E excluded? ""PRICE""? I excluded? ""PRIDE""? E excluded? ""CRIME""? I excluded? ""GRIME""? E excluded? ""DROVE""? E excluded? ""GROVE""? E excluded? ""PROVE""? E excluded? ""TROVE""? T and E excluded? ""BROKE""? B and E excluded? ""CRAKE""? E excluded? ""DRAKE""? E excluded? ""FLAKE""? E excluded? ""BRAKE""? B and E excluded? ""CROZE""? E? Not common? ""CROME""? Not? ""DROME""? E? Not? ""GROPE""? E excluded? ""GRAPE""? E excluded? ""CRAPE""? E excluded? ""TRAPE""? Not? ""GROAN"" we have? But that has A at 4? Not at 5.

I think it's hard to find a word with A at 5? So probably A is at 4? And R at 2? So the word is _ R O A _

With the first letter to be determined? And the last letter? From available letters.

We have two candidates: ""CROAK"" and ""GROAN"".

But we also have the possibility that R is at 5? But we couldn't find a common word? So let's assume R is at 2? And A at 4? Then we can guess one of these? But which one?

We can choose a word that tests more letters? Or we can choose one that covers both possibilities? But we have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't assume R at 2? But tests the position of R and A? For example, we can put R at 5 and A at 4? But we need a valid word? Or we can put R at 2 and A at 5? But we couldn't find one.

Another idea: we can put A at 4? And R at a different position? But we know R must be at 2 or 5? And we are trying to test.

We can guess a word that has A at 4? And R at 5? But we need a word with O at 3? And A at 4? R at 5? And the first two letters? We couldn't find? But let's try ""DOZAR""? Not? ""FOYAR""? Not? ""HOYAR""? Not? ""KOJAR""? Not? ""MOJAR""? Not? ""NOYAR""? Not? ""POJAR""? Not? ""ROYAR""? Not? ""SOJAR""? S excluded? ""TOJAR""? T excluded? ""VOJAR""? Not? ""WOJAR""? Not? ""YOKAR""? Not? ""ZORAK""? Not? ""KORAT""? T excluded? ""MORAT""? Not? ""NORAT""? Not? ""PORAT""? Not? ""SORAT""? S excluded? ""TORAT""? T excluded? ""VORAT""? Not? ""WORAT""? Not? ""YORAK""? Not? ""ZORAK""? Not? ""CORAL""? But O at 2? Not at 3? ""CORAL"": C1,O2,R3,A4,L5? But we need O at 3? So not.

Perhaps ""AORTA""? But A at 1? And O at 2? Not at 3? ""AORTA"": A1,O2,R3,T4,A5? But T excluded? And O at 2? Not.

I think it's safe to assume that R is at 2? And A at 4? So the word is _ R O A _

Now, for the third guess, we can guess ""CROAK"" or ""GROAN""? But we have to choose one.

We can also guess a word that has different letters to test? For example, if we guess ""CROAK"", we test C and K? If we guess ""GROAN"", we test G and N.

We don't know which? So we can choose based on letter frequency? Or arbitrarily.

But we have position 1 and 5 to fill? With letters not excluded.

Also, we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Let me list the frequency: common letters left: L, N, D, C, M, P, U, etc.

But we can choose ""GROAN"" because G and N are common? Or ""CROAK"" with C and K? K is less common.

So ""GROAN"" might be better? But let's see.

Another word: ""PROAM""? Not? ""DROAM""? Not? ""FROAM""? Not? ""PROMO""? No A? ""PRONA""? Not? ""CRENA""? E excluded? ""DRAMA""? But A at 4 and 5? Duplicate? And M? But ""DRAMA"": D1,R2,A3,M4,A5? But we need O at 3? Not A? So not.

So only ""CROAK"" and ""GROAN"" seem valid? And ""GROAN"" has G and N? Which are more common than C and K? But C is also common.

But let's consider: if we guess ""GROAN"", then:
- If the secret word is ""GROAN"", we win? But if not, we get feedback on G and N.

Similarly for ""CROAK"".

But we have another possibility: what if R is at 5? And A at 4? But we couldn't find a word? So maybe it's not? Or we missed ""MORAY""? But ""MORAY"" has O at 2? Not.

""OCTAR""? Not? ""OCTAN""? Not? ""OPTAR""? Not? ""OVARY""? O at 1? Not.

I think we should go with ""GROAN"" or ""CROAK"".

But let's choose ""GROAN"" because it has N? Which is very common.

So guess: GROAN

But in ""GROAN"": G1, R2, O3, A4, N5.

Now, let's see what feedback we would get if the secret word is something else? But we don't know.

We can also consider that if we are wrong, we get information.

But we have to make a guess.

So I'll go with ""GROAN"".

But let's double-check the feedback constraints.

From guess 2: O is at position 3? Correct? So in ""GROAN"", O is at 3? Good.

A is at 4? We are testing that.

R is at 2? Testing that.

G and N are new? We will see if they are in the word.

But we know the word has R, A, O? And we are including them? So if G and N are not in the word, we get x for them? And if the positions are wrong for R and A? We get -? Or if correct, ✓.

But if the secret word has R at 5? Then in ""GROAN"", R is at 2? Which is wrong? So we would get R(-)? And A at 4? If the secret word has A at 4? Then A(✓)? Or if not, A(-)? But we think A is at 4? But if the secret word has R at 5 and A at 4? But we couldn't find a word? So maybe not.

Perhaps the secret word is ""GROAN""? Or ""CROAK""? Or another word.

Another word: ""DROWN""? But no A? And T not? ""DROWN"": D R O W N? No A? So not? Because A must be in the word.

Similarly, ""CROWD""? No A.

So I think ""GROAN"" is a good guess.

So third guess: GROAN

- **Guess 1: RAISE**  
  Feedback: R(-), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)

   - **Case 3**: R at position 5, A at position 4 (e.g., `_ _ O A R`).  
6. **Case 3 (R at 5, A at 4) is unlikely** due to a lack of common English words fitting `_ _ O A R` (e.g., no valid words like ""MORAR"" or ""FLOAR"").  
7. **Case 2 (R at 2, A at 5) is challenging** due to few valid words (e.g., ""CROAT"" and ""GROAT"" are invalid as they contain T, which is excluded).
