We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. Let's choose one that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). Also, no repeated letters.

We received feedback for ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
 This means:
  - E is in the word and in the correct position. Since E was the last letter, the secret word ends with E.
  - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word is of the form _ _ _ _ E, and it does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 For the next guess, we need to include E in the last position and try other letters that are common and not C, R, A, N.

 Since E is fixed at the end, we can think of words ending with E.

 Let's consider common letters that might be in the word. We should avoid using C, R, A, N.

 Possible starting words: We want to cover more common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried.

 Vowels: We know A is not in the word, so remaining vowels are I, O, U (but Y is sometimes a vowel). We have not tried O, I, U, etc.
 Consonants: Avoid C, R, A, N. Common consonants include S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, K, etc.

 We also know the word has 5 letters and ends with E.

 Example words ending with E: 
   Common words: HOUSE, MOUSE, PLUME, SLICE, SLIME, SPIKE, STYLE, etc.

 But note: Our first guess used C, R, A, N, E. All of which except E are absent.

 We must avoid using C, R, A, N.

 Let me brainstorm a word that:
   - Ends with E
   - Contains letters we haven't tried, like S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, K, and vowels O, I, U.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 One good candidate is ""SLICE"", but note that we already know C is absent? Wait, feedback said C(x) so C is absent. So we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Alternative: ""SLIME"" -> S, L, I, M, E. But note we haven't tried S, L, I, M.

 However, we have E at the end, so we can use:

 Let's try ""SLIME"": 
   Positions: 1-S, 2-L, 3-I, 4-M, 5-E.

 But wait, does the word have E? We know E is in the fifth position, but we don't know if there are other E's? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple E's. However, since we only have one E in ""crane"" and it was marked correct in position 5, but there might be another E? We should consider that possibility, but for now, let's assume we don't have information about other positions.

 However, we are constrained: we cannot use C, R, A, N.

 Another candidate: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E. This uses S, T, O, L.

 But note: We know E is at the end, so ""STOLE"" ends with E. And we avoid forbidden letters.

 We could also consider ""SPIKE"": but K and P are new. However, note that we don't know if the word has a K? But ""SPIKE"" uses S, P, I, K, E. That seems good.

 But we must ensure that we do not use any of the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N). Both ""STOLE"" and ""SPIKE"" are safe.

 Let's list the letters we are about to test:

 For ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L -> and E we already know is in the word.
 For ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K -> and E.

 Another option: ""SMITE"" (S, M, I, T, E) -> covers M and I.

 We want to maximize information. Currently, we only have one known letter (E at the end) and four letters eliminated.

 Since the first four letters of ""crane"" were all absent, we have a clean slate for the first four positions.

 I think ""SPIKE"" is a good choice because it uses common letters S, P, I, K. Or ""STOLE""?

 Alternatively, we can use a word that includes more vowels. Let's try ""POISE"": but ends with E? No, POISE ends with E? P-O-I-S-E -> yes, ends with E. But note: ""POISE"" has S at position 4? We need to consider the structure.

 However, we have to avoid letters that we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me choose ""SPIKE"" because it has a good mix.

 Alternatively, ""STYLE"": ends with E, uses S, T, Y, L, E. Y is less common but can be a vowel.

 But note: we don't know if the word has Y. So maybe better to use a word with more common consonants.

 Considering that, I'll go with ""SLIPE"" (if valid): S-L-I-P-E? I'm not sure if ""SLIPE"" is a valid word. Let me think of common words.

 Another common word: ""SLATE"". But wait, feedback from first guess: A is absent! So we cannot use A. Thus ""SLATE"" has A which is absent -> so we avoid.

 ""STOLE"": valid word? yes. Or ""STYLE"" is valid.

 Let's decide: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E.

 This way, we test S, T, O, L.

 So, the next guess is ""STOLE"".

 Alternatively, if we want more vowel coverage: ""POISE"" is valid? Yes. And it uses P, O, I, S, E. That covers O and I which are vowels we haven't tried.

 But note: the feedback only told us about the letters in the first guess. Since E is already known to be present and at position 5, we can use it again? Actually, we can, but it would not give new information about E. However, we might get information if there are multiple E's? Because if we put an E in a different position and it shows as present (-) or absent (x), that would tell us. But in ""POISE"", E is at the end so same position. We won't get new info about E.

 Actually, in ""STOLE"", E is at the end too. So same.

 To test for multiple E's, we could put E in a different position? But we don't know yet. And we only have 6 tries, so we might not want to risk it now.

 Since the word ends with E, and we haven't seen any other E, it's possible there is only one E. We can check for multiple E's later if needed.

 For now, I think ""STOLE"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we know the secret word doesn't contain A, so if we choose a word without A, it's good.

 Let's go with ""STOLE"".

 If ""STOLE"" is not acceptable for some reason, we can choose ""SPILE"" or ""SMILE"", but let me check:

 ""SMILE"": S, M, I, L, E -> avoids forbidden letters, and tests M and I.

 Why not? It has two vowels (I and ... SMILE has I and E). Actually, we already know E is in the word.

 Alternatively, ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> tests K and P.

 I'll choose ""SMILE"" because it has M and I, which are common and we haven't tested.

 But wait: we have not tried S, M, I, L. That's four new letters.

 So, let me decide:

 Option 1: ""STOLE"" -> tests S, T, O, L.
 Option 2: ""SMILE"" -> tests S, M, I, L.
 Option 3: ""SPIKE"" -> tests S, P, I, K.

 They are all good.

 Since we know E is in the word and at the end, let's pick a word that has E only at the end? Actually, all these words have E only at the end.

 I think ""SMILE"" is a common word and uses M and I, which are important.

 Alternatively, we can look for a word that includes more vowels. The only vowels left are E (at end), and we haven't tested I, O, U. ""SMILE"" uses I, which is a vowel.

 I'll go with ""SMILE"".

 However, what if the word has O? We don't know. But we'll test other letters later.

 Since we have limited guesses, we need to maximize information. The letter M might be less common than T? Not necessarily.

 But note: T is a very common consonant. So maybe ""STOLE"" is better because it tests T and O.

 Let's check letter frequencies in English:

 Common consonants after the ones we eliminated: S, T, L, D, U, G, B, M, P, etc.

 So T is more common than M.

 Therefore, perhaps ""STOLE"" is better: it tests T (very common) and O (common vowel).

 Also, L is common.

 So let me change to ""STOLE"".

 Final decision: ""STOLE"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- E is correct and in position 5 (✓), meaning the secret word ends with E.  
- C, R, A, N are absent (x), so they can be eliminated.  

For the second guess:  
- Must end with E (position 5).  
- Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.  
- Prioritize common unresolved letters like S, T, O, L, M, P, I, etc., to maximize information.  

After evaluating options like ""SMILE"" (tests M, I), ""SPIKE"" (tests P, K), and ""STOLE"" (tests T, O), I selected ""STOLE"" because:  
- It tests high-frequency consonants (T, S, L) and a common vowel (O).  
- All letters are untested except E (which is fixed in position 5).  
- It follows the format _ _ _ _ E.  

If ""STOLE"" is invalid, fallbacks could include ""SMILE"" or ""POISE"", but ""STOLE"" is a strong choice here.

   - Contains letters we haven't tried, like S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, K, and vowels O, I, U.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 One good candidate is ""SLICE"", but note that we already know C is absent? Wait, feedback said C(x) so C is absent. So we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Alternative: ""SLIME"" -> S, L, I, M, E. But note we haven't tried S, L, I, M.

 However, we have E at the end, so we can use:

 Let's try ""SLIME"": 
   Positions: 1-S, 2-L, 3-I, 4-M, 5-E.

 But wait, does the word have E? We know E is in the fifth position, but we don't know if there are other E's? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple E's. However, since we only have one E in ""crane"" and it was marked correct in position 5, but there might be another E? We should consider that possibility, but for now, let's assume we don't have information about other positions.

 However, we are constrained: we cannot use C, R, A, N.

 Another candidate: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E. This uses S, T, O, L.

 But note: We know E is at the end, so ""STOLE"" ends with E. And we avoid forbidden letters.

 We could also consider ""SPIKE"": but K and P are new. However, note that we don't know if the word has a K? But ""SPIKE"" uses S, P, I, K, E. That seems good.

 But we must ensure that we do not use any of the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N). Both ""STOLE"" and ""SPIKE"" are safe.

 Let's list the letters we are about to test:

 For ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L -> and E we already know is in the word.
 For ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K -> and E.

 Another option: ""SMITE"" (S, M, I, T, E) -> covers M and I.

 We want to maximize information. Currently, we only have one known letter (E at the end) and four letters eliminated.

 Since the first four letters of ""crane"" were all absent, we have a clean slate for the first four positions.

 I think ""SPIKE"" is a good choice because it uses common letters S, P, I, K. Or ""STOLE""?

 Alternatively, we can use a word that includes more vowels. Let's try ""POISE"": but ends with E? No, POISE ends with E? P-O-I-S-E -> yes, ends with E. But note: ""POISE"" has S at position 4? We need to consider the structure.

 However, we have to avoid letters that we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me choose ""SPIKE"" because it has a good mix.

 Alternatively, ""STYLE"": ends with E, uses S, T, Y, L, E. Y is less common but can be a vowel.

 But note: we don't know if the word has Y. So maybe better to use a word with more common consonants.

 Considering that, I'll go with ""SLIPE"" (if valid): S-L-I-P-E? I'm not sure if ""SLIPE"" is a valid word. Let me think of common words.

 Another common word: ""SLATE"". But wait, feedback from first guess: A is absent! So we cannot use A. Thus ""SLATE"" has A which is absent -> so we avoid.

 ""STOLE"": valid word? yes. Or ""STYLE"" is valid.

 Let's decide: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E.

 This way, we test S, T, O, L.

 So, the next guess is ""STOLE"".

 Alternatively, if we want more vowel coverage: ""POISE"" is valid? Yes. And it uses P, O, I, S, E. That covers O and I which are vowels we haven't tried.

 But note: the feedback only told us about the letters in the first guess. Since E is already known to be present and at position 5, we can use it again? Actually, we can, but it would not give new information about E. However, we might get information if there are multiple E's? Because if we put an E in a different position and it shows as present (-) or absent (x), that would tell us. But in ""POISE"", E is at the end so same position. We won't get new info about E.

 Actually, in ""STOLE"", E is at the end too. So same.

 To test for multiple E's, we could put E in a different position? But we don't know yet. And we only have 6 tries, so we might not want to risk it now.

 Since the word ends with E, and we haven't seen any other E, it's possible there is only one E. We can check for multiple E's later if needed.

 For now, I think ""STOLE"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we know the secret word doesn't contain A, so if we choose a word without A, it's good.

 Let's go with ""STOLE"".

 If ""STOLE"" is not acceptable for some reason, we can choose ""SPILE"" or ""SMILE"", but let me check:

 ""SMILE"": S, M, I, L, E -> avoids forbidden letters, and tests M and I.

 Why not? It has two vowels (I and ... SMILE has I and E). Actually, we already know E is in the word.

 Alternatively, ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> tests K and P.

 I'll choose ""SMILE"" because it has M and I, which are common and we haven't tested.

 But wait: we have not tried S, M, I, L. That's four new letters.

 So, let me decide:

 Option 1: ""STOLE"" -> tests S, T, O, L.
 Option 2: ""SMILE"" -> tests S, M, I, L.
 Option 3: ""SPIKE"" -> tests S, P, I, K.

 They are all good.

 Since we know E is in the word and at the end, let's pick a word that has E only at the end? Actually, all these words have E only at the end.

 I think ""SMILE"" is a common word and uses M and I, which are important.

 Alternatively, we can look for a word that includes more vowels. The only vowels left are E (at end), and we haven't tested I, O, U. ""SMILE"" uses I, which is a vowel.

 I'll go with ""SMILE"".

 However, what if the word has O? We don't know. But we'll test other letters later.

 Since we have limited guesses, we need to maximize information. The letter M might be less common than T? Not necessarily.

 But note: T is a very common consonant. So maybe ""STOLE"" is better because it tests T and O.

 Let's check letter frequencies in English:

 Common consonants after the ones we eliminated: S, T, L, D, U, G, B, M, P, etc.

 So T is more common than M.

 Therefore, perhaps ""STOLE"" is better: it tests T (very common) and O (common vowel).

 Also, L is common.

 So let me change to ""STOLE"".

 Final decision: ""STOLE"".

<guess>stole</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- E is correct and in position 5 (✓), meaning the secret word ends with E.  
- C, R, A, N are absent (x), so they can be eliminated.  

For the second guess:  
- Must end with E (position 5).  
- Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.  
- Prioritize common unresolved letters like S, T, O, L, M, P, I, etc., to maximize information.  

After evaluating options like ""SMILE"" (tests M, I), ""SPIKE"" (tests P, K), and ""STOLE"" (tests T, O), I selected ""STOLE"" because:  
- It tests high-frequency consonants (T, S, L) and a common vowel (O).  
- All letters are untested except E (which is fixed in position 5).  
- It follows the format _ _ _ _ E.  

If ""STOLE"" is invalid, fallbacks could include ""SMILE"" or ""POISE"", but ""STOLE"" is a strong choice here.

We have two pieces of feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: stole -> Feedback: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- S, T, O, E are correct and in the correct positions. Specifically:
  - S in position 1: ✓
  - T in position 2: ✓
  - O in position 3: ✓
  - L in position 4: x -> not in the word
  - E in position 5: ✓ (already known)

So, combining what we know:
- The secret word is S T O _ E. (since positions 1,2,3,5 are fixed: S, T, O, E)
- The missing letter is the fourth one.
- We know the letter cannot be L (because L was marked absent in position 4 and since it's marked absent, it's not in the word at all? Wait, the feedback for L is x, meaning the letter L is not in the word at all. Because if it were in the word but wrong position, it would be marked with '-'. So L is not in the word.
- Also, from guess 1, we know that C, R, A, N are absent.

Therefore, the secret word is S T O ? E, and the fourth letter (position 4) must be a letter that:
- Is not C, R, A, N, or L.
- It could be any other letter except those.

We only need to guess the fourth letter.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words of the form S T O _ E.

We must choose a word that fits the pattern and uses only letters that are not eliminated.

Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, N, L.

We need to find a word: S T O ? E.

Possible words:
- STOKE (K is not eliminated)
- STONE (but N is eliminated by the first guess? Guess 1: N(x) -> yes, N is out)
- STOPE (valid? meaning, and P is available)
- STORE (but R is eliminated? Guess 1: R(x) -> out)
- STOLE (we already guessed it and L is out, so not this)
- STOKE: yes
- STOVE (V is available)
- STYME? Not sure about validity.

We must use valid English words.

Common words:
- STOKE: to add fuel to (a fire). Valid.
- STOPE: an excavation in a mine. It might be less common but valid.
- STOVE: a device for heating or cooking. Valid.
- STOPE and STOVE have the letter O in position 3? Yes, O is fixed.

Also, note that we must avoid L as well.

So possible words: STOKE, STOVE, and perhaps others.

What about STYME? Not sure. Or STAGE? But G would be new, but also A is eliminated (first guess A(x)).

STAGE has A, which is eliminated.

Another: STONE: has N, eliminated.

STORE: has R, eliminated.

STOLE: we guessed and L is eliminated.

So remaining options: STOKE, STOVE, and perhaps STOPE.

But STOPE is a valid word: a step-like excavation in mining.

Also, could there be STOKE and STOVE.

Now, we need to guess one of them. But we have no further information. We have only one unknown letter.

We can guess STOKE or STOVE arbitrarily? But note, we have 6 total guesses, and this is the third guess.

We can also use a word that tests other letters? But we already know the entire word except the fourth letter. The unknown is a single letter.

But we can't introduce extra letters? Because we have to form a word.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that contains the pattern STO?E but also includes other letters? That doesn't make sense because we know positions 1,2,3,5 are fixed. So the word must be STO?E.

Therefore, the only possibilities are words fitting STO?E that are valid and don't use eliminated letters.

So let's list:

- STOKE
- STOVE
- STOPE

Are there others?

- STARE: but A is eliminated and R is eliminated? A and R are out? STARE has A and R -> eliminated.
- STYLE: but Y is available? But L is in position 4? L is eliminated. So STYLE has L -> L is eliminated (marked absent in guess 2). So no L.
- STUKE: is that a word? Not common.
- So we have STOKE, STOVE, STOPE.

We need to guess one. How to differentiate? We don't have any way. We must guess one of them.

But note: we have not eliminated K, P, V. They are all still possible.

So we must guess arbitrarily? Or we can think about common words.

Likely words: STOKE and STOVE are more common than STOPE.

Between STOKE and STOVE, STOVE is a very common word.

So we might guess STOVE? Also, STOVE uses V, which is less common than K? But we don't know.

But we must return a guess.

We could also use a word that doesn't follow the pattern? But that would be inefficient because we already know S,T,O,E are fixed. Why not guess the word directly?

For example, we can guess STOKE to test if K is present.

But we are trying to get the secret word by guessing one of the candidates.

So I think STOVE is a good candidate to guess.

Alternatively, to maximize information: but since we know the pattern, there is no new information to get. We have to fill the blank.

So let's guess STOVE.

If it's wrong, we can try STOKE next.

Since we have many guesses left (6 total, this is third).

But let me check: after STOVE, we get feedback on V.

If V is correct, we have the word. If not, then we know it's STOKE or STOPE.

Similarly, if we guess STOKE and K is correct, done. If not, then STOVE or STOPE.

But STOPE and STOVE both have O? In position 3? Wait, O is already fixed? So STOVE: positions - S(1), T(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). Similarly, STOPE: S(1), T(2), O(3), P(4), E(5). But in STOPE, the fourth letter is P?

Wait, spelling: STOPE is S-T-O-P-E? So five letters: positions 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:P, 5:E.

Similarly, STOVE: S-T-O-V-E.

STOKE: S-T-O-K-E.

So they differ only in position 4: either K, V, or P.

We have no additional information to narrow down K, V, P.

So we must guess one.

Given that STOVE is a common household appliance, it might be more likely? But we don't know the pool.

In Wordle, common words are more probable.

Therefore, I'll guess STOVE.

But what about the letter frequency? K, V, P: P is more common? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can consider the first guess: we didn't have any of these letters? But that doesn't help.

Since time is limited, we'll guess STOVE.

So the next word: STOVE.

But note: in guess 2, we used STOLE, which had L. STOVE has V which we never used before.

Similarly, STOKE has K.

So both are fine.

Guess: STOVE

But let's confirm: STOVE is a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

Therefore:

Based on the previous feedback:  
- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)`

  - C, R, A, and N are not in the word.

  - S, T, O, and E (position 5) are correct and in position.  
  - L is absent.  
- Secret word must be in the format `S T O ? E` (positions 1–3 and 5 fixed).

Therefore, the secret word is S T O ? E, and the fourth letter (position 4) must be a letter that:
- Is not C, R, A, N, or L.
- It could be any other letter except those.

We only need to guess the fourth letter.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words of the form S T O _ E.

We must choose a word that fits the pattern and uses only letters that are not eliminated.

Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, N, L.

We need to find a word: S T O ? E.

Possible words:
- STOKE (K is not eliminated)
- STONE (but N is eliminated by the first guess? Guess 1: N(x) -> yes, N is out)
- STOPE (valid? meaning, and P is available)
- STORE (but R is eliminated? Guess 1: R(x) -> out)
- STOLE (we already guessed it and L is out, so not this)
- STOKE: yes
- STOVE (V is available)
- STYME? Not sure about validity.

We must use valid English words.

Common words:
- STOKE: to add fuel to (a fire). Valid.
- STOPE: an excavation in a mine. It might be less common but valid.
- STOVE: a device for heating or cooking. Valid.
- STOPE and STOVE have the letter O in position 3? Yes, O is fixed.

Also, note that we must avoid L as well.

So possible words: STOKE, STOVE, and perhaps others.

What about STYME? Not sure. Or STAGE? But G would be new, but also A is eliminated (first guess A(x)).

STAGE has A, which is eliminated.

Another: STONE: has N, eliminated.

STORE: has R, eliminated.

STOLE: we guessed and L is eliminated.

So remaining options: STOKE, STOVE, and perhaps STOPE.

But STOPE is a valid word: a step-like excavation in mining.

Also, could there be STOKE and STOVE.

Now, we need to guess one of them. But we have no further information. We have only one unknown letter.

We can guess STOKE or STOVE arbitrarily? But note, we have 6 total guesses, and this is the third guess.

We can also use a word that tests other letters? But we already know the entire word except the fourth letter. The unknown is a single letter.

But we can't introduce extra letters? Because we have to form a word.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that contains the pattern STO?E but also includes other letters? That doesn't make sense because we know positions 1,2,3,5 are fixed. So the word must be STO?E.

Therefore, the only possibilities are words fitting STO?E that are valid and don't use eliminated letters.

So let's list:

- STOKE
- STOVE
- STOPE

Are there others?

- STARE: but A is eliminated and R is eliminated? A and R are out? STARE has A and R -> eliminated.
- STYLE: but Y is available? But L is in position 4? L is eliminated. So STYLE has L -> L is eliminated (marked absent in guess 2). So no L.
- STUKE: is that a word? Not common.
- So we have STOKE, STOVE, STOPE.

We need to guess one. How to differentiate? We don't have any way. We must guess one of them.

But note: we have not eliminated K, P, V. They are all still possible.

So we must guess arbitrarily? Or we can think about common words.

Likely words: STOKE and STOVE are more common than STOPE.

Between STOKE and STOVE, STOVE is a very common word.

So we might guess STOVE? Also, STOVE uses V, which is less common than K? But we don't know.

But we must return a guess.

We could also use a word that doesn't follow the pattern? But that would be inefficient because we already know S,T,O,E are fixed. Why not guess the word directly?

For example, we can guess STOKE to test if K is present.

But we are trying to get the secret word by guessing one of the candidates.

So I think STOVE is a good candidate to guess.

Alternatively, to maximize information: but since we know the pattern, there is no new information to get. We have to fill the blank.

So let's guess STOVE.

If it's wrong, we can try STOKE next.

Since we have many guesses left (6 total, this is third).

But let me check: after STOVE, we get feedback on V.

If V is correct, we have the word. If not, then we know it's STOKE or STOPE.

Similarly, if we guess STOKE and K is correct, done. If not, then STOVE or STOPE.

But STOPE and STOVE both have O? In position 3? Wait, O is already fixed? So STOVE: positions - S(1), T(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). Similarly, STOPE: S(1), T(2), O(3), P(4), E(5). But in STOPE, the fourth letter is P?

Wait, spelling: STOPE is S-T-O-P-E? So five letters: positions 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:P, 5:E.

Similarly, STOVE: S-T-O-V-E.

STOKE: S-T-O-K-E.

So they differ only in position 4: either K, V, or P.

We have no additional information to narrow down K, V, P.

So we must guess one.

Given that STOVE is a common household appliance, it might be more likely? But we don't know the pool.

In Wordle, common words are more probable.

Therefore, I'll guess STOVE.

But what about the letter frequency? K, V, P: P is more common? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can consider the first guess: we didn't have any of these letters? But that doesn't help.

Since time is limited, we'll guess STOVE.

So the next word: STOVE.

But note: in guess 2, we used STOLE, which had L. STOVE has V which we never used before.

Similarly, STOKE has K.

So both are fine.

Guess: STOVE

But let's confirm: STOVE is a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. Let's choose one that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). Also, no repeated letters.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We received feedback for ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
 This means:
  - E is in the word and in the correct position. Since E was the last letter, the secret word ends with E.
  - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word is of the form _ _ _ _ E, and it does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 For the next guess, we need to include E in the last position and try other letters that are common and not C, R, A, N.

 Since E is fixed at the end, we can think of words ending with E.

 Let's consider common letters that might be in the word. We should avoid using C, R, A, N.

 Possible starting words: We want to cover more common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried.

 Vowels: We know A is not in the word, so remaining vowels are I, O, U (but Y is sometimes a vowel). We have not tried O, I, U, etc.
 Consonants: Avoid C, R, A, N. Common consonants include S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, K, etc.

 We also know the word has 5 letters and ends with E.

 Example words ending with E: 
   Common words: HOUSE, MOUSE, PLUME, SLICE, SLIME, SPIKE, STYLE, etc.

 But note: Our first guess used C, R, A, N, E. All of which except E are absent.

 We must avoid using C, R, A, N.

 Let me brainstorm a word that:
   - Ends with E
   - Contains letters we haven't tried, like S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, K, and vowels O, I, U.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 One good candidate is ""SLICE"", but note that we already know C is absent? Wait, feedback said C(x) so C is absent. So we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Alternative: ""SLIME"" -> S, L, I, M, E. But note we haven't tried S, L, I, M.

 However, we have E at the end, so we can use:

 Let's try ""SLIME"": 
   Positions: 1-S, 2-L, 3-I, 4-M, 5-E.

 But wait, does the word have E? We know E is in the fifth position, but we don't know if there are other E's? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple E's. However, since we only have one E in ""crane"" and it was marked correct in position 5, but there might be another E? We should consider that possibility, but for now, let's assume we don't have information about other positions.

 However, we are constrained: we cannot use C, R, A, N.

 Another candidate: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E. This uses S, T, O, L.

 But note: We know E is at the end, so ""STOLE"" ends with E. And we avoid forbidden letters.

 We could also consider ""SPIKE"": but K and P are new. However, note that we don't know if the word has a K? But ""SPIKE"" uses S, P, I, K, E. That seems good.

 But we must ensure that we do not use any of the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N). Both ""STOLE"" and ""SPIKE"" are safe.

 Let's list the letters we are about to test:

 For ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L -> and E we already know is in the word.
 For ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K -> and E.

 Another option: ""SMITE"" (S, M, I, T, E) -> covers M and I.

 We want to maximize information. Currently, we only have one known letter (E at the end) and four letters eliminated.

 Since the first four letters of ""crane"" were all absent, we have a clean slate for the first four positions.

 I think ""SPIKE"" is a good choice because it uses common letters S, P, I, K. Or ""STOLE""?

 Alternatively, we can use a word that includes more vowels. Let's try ""POISE"": but ends with E? No, POISE ends with E? P-O-I-S-E -> yes, ends with E. But note: ""POISE"" has S at position 4? We need to consider the structure.

 However, we have to avoid letters that we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me choose ""SPIKE"" because it has a good mix.

 Alternatively, ""STYLE"": ends with E, uses S, T, Y, L, E. Y is less common but can be a vowel.

 But note: we don't know if the word has Y. So maybe better to use a word with more common consonants.

 Considering that, I'll go with ""SLIPE"" (if valid): S-L-I-P-E? I'm not sure if ""SLIPE"" is a valid word. Let me think of common words.

 Another common word: ""SLATE"". But wait, feedback from first guess: A is absent! So we cannot use A. Thus ""SLATE"" has A which is absent -> so we avoid.

 ""STOLE"": valid word? yes. Or ""STYLE"" is valid.

 Let's decide: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E.

 This way, we test S, T, O, L.

 So, the next guess is ""STOLE"".

 Alternatively, if we want more vowel coverage: ""POISE"" is valid? Yes. And it uses P, O, I, S, E. That covers O and I which are vowels we haven't tried.

 But note: the feedback only told us about the letters in the first guess. Since E is already known to be present and at position 5, we can use it again? Actually, we can, but it would not give new information about E. However, we might get information if there are multiple E's? Because if we put an E in a different position and it shows as present (-) or absent (x), that would tell us. But in ""POISE"", E is at the end so same position. We won't get new info about E.

 Actually, in ""STOLE"", E is at the end too. So same.

 To test for multiple E's, we could put E in a different position? But we don't know yet. And we only have 6 tries, so we might not want to risk it now.

 Since the word ends with E, and we haven't seen any other E, it's possible there is only one E. We can check for multiple E's later if needed.

 For now, I think ""STOLE"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we know the secret word doesn't contain A, so if we choose a word without A, it's good.

 Let's go with ""STOLE"".

 If ""STOLE"" is not acceptable for some reason, we can choose ""SPILE"" or ""SMILE"", but let me check:

 ""SMILE"": S, M, I, L, E -> avoids forbidden letters, and tests M and I.

 Why not? It has two vowels (I and ... SMILE has I and E). Actually, we already know E is in the word.

 Alternatively, ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> tests K and P.

 I'll choose ""SMILE"" because it has M and I, which are common and we haven't tested.

 But wait: we have not tried S, M, I, L. That's four new letters.

 So, let me decide:

 Option 1: ""STOLE"" -> tests S, T, O, L.
 Option 2: ""SMILE"" -> tests S, M, I, L.
 Option 3: ""SPIKE"" -> tests S, P, I, K.

 They are all good.

 Since we know E is in the word and at the end, let's pick a word that has E only at the end? Actually, all these words have E only at the end.

 I think ""SMILE"" is a common word and uses M and I, which are important.

 Alternatively, we can look for a word that includes more vowels. The only vowels left are E (at end), and we haven't tested I, O, U. ""SMILE"" uses I, which is a vowel.

 I'll go with ""SMILE"".

 However, what if the word has O? We don't know. But we'll test other letters later.

 Since we have limited guesses, we need to maximize information. The letter M might be less common than T? Not necessarily.

 But note: T is a very common consonant. So maybe ""STOLE"" is better because it tests T and O.

 Let's check letter frequencies in English:

 Common consonants after the ones we eliminated: S, T, L, D, U, G, B, M, P, etc.

 So T is more common than M.

 Therefore, perhaps ""STOLE"" is better: it tests T (very common) and O (common vowel).

 Also, L is common.

 So let me change to ""STOLE"".

 Final decision: ""STOLE"".

<guess>stole</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- E is correct and in position 5 (✓), meaning the secret word ends with E.  
- C, R, A, N are absent (x), so they can be eliminated.  

For the second guess:  
- Must end with E (position 5).  
- Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.  
- Prioritize common unresolved letters like S, T, O, L, M, P, I, etc., to maximize information.  

After evaluating options like ""SMILE"" (tests M, I), ""SPIKE"" (tests P, K), and ""STOLE"" (tests T, O), I selected ""STOLE"" because:  
- It tests high-frequency consonants (T, S, L) and a common vowel (O).  
- All letters are untested except E (which is fixed in position 5).  
- It follows the format _ _ _ _ E.  

If ""STOLE"" is invalid, fallbacks could include ""SMILE"" or ""POISE"", but ""STOLE"" is a strong choice here.

  - T in position 2: ✓
  - O in position 3: ✓
  - L in position 4: x -> not in the word
  - E in position 5: ✓ (already known)

So, combining what we know:
- The secret word is S T O _ E. (since positions 1,2,3,5 are fixed: S, T, O, E)
- The missing letter is the fourth one.
- We know the letter cannot be L (because L was marked absent in position 4 and since it's marked absent, it's not in the word at all?

Since E was the last letter, the secret word ends with E.\n  - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\n Therefore, the secret word is of the form _ _ _ _ E, and it does not contain C, R, A, or N.\n\n For the next guess, we need to include E in the last position and try other letters that are common and not C, R, A, N.\n\n Since E is fixed at the end, we can think of words ending with E.\n\n Let\'s consider common letters that might be in the word. We should avoid using C, R, A, N.\n\n Possible starting words: We want to cover more common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tried.\n\n Vowels: We know A is not in the word, so remaining vowels are I, O, U (but Y is sometimes a vowel). We have not tried O, I, U, etc.\n Consonants: Avoid C, R, A, N. Common consonants include S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, K, etc.\n\n We also know the word has 5 letters and ends with E.\n\n Example words ending with E: \n   Common words: HOUSE, MOUSE, PLUME, SLICE, SLIME, SPIKE, STYLE, etc.\n\n But note: Our first guess used C, R, A, N, E. All of which except E are absent.\n\n We must avoid using C, R, A, N.\n\n Let me brainstorm a word that:\n   - Ends with E\n   - Contains letters we haven\'t tried, like S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, K, and vowels O, I, U.\n\n We want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n One good candidate is ""SLICE"", but note that we already know C is absent? Wait, feedback said C(x) so C is absent. So we cannot use C.\n\n We must avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n Alternative: ""SLIME"" -> S, L, I, M, E. But note we haven\'t tried S, L, I, M.\n\n However, we have E at the end, so we can use:\n\n Let\'s try ""SLIME"": \n   Positions: 1-S, 2-L, 3-I, 4-M, 5-E.\n\n But wait, does the word have E? We know E is in the fifth position, but we don\'t know if there are other E\'s? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are multiple E\'s. However, since we only have one E in ""crane"" and it was marked correct in position 5, but there might be another E? We should consider that possibility, but for now, let\'s assume we don\'t have information about other positions.\n\n However, we are constrained: we cannot use C, R, A, N.\n\n Another candidate: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E. This uses S, T, O, L.\n\n But note: We know E is at the end, so ""STOLE"" ends with E. And we avoid forbidden letters.\n\n We could also consider ""SPIKE"": but K and P are new. However, note that we don\'t know if the word has a K? But ""SPIKE"" uses S, P, I, K, E. That seems good.\n\n But we must ensure that we do not use any of the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N). Both ""STOLE"" and ""SPIKE"" are safe.\n\n Let\'s list the letters we are about to test:\n\n For ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L -> and E we already know is in the word.\n For ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K -> and E.\n\n Another option: ""SMITE"" (S, M, I, T, E) -> covers M and I.\n\n We want to maximize information. Currently, we only have one known letter (E at the end) and four letters eliminated.\n\n Since the first four letters of ""crane"" were all absent, we have a clean slate for the first four positions.\n\n I think ""SPIKE"" is a good choice because it uses common letters S, P, I, K. Or ""STOLE""?\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that includes more vowels. Let\'s try ""POISE"": but ends with E? No, POISE ends with E? P-O-I-S-E -> yes, ends with E. But note: ""POISE"" has S at position 4? We need to consider the structure.\n\n However, we have to avoid letters that we know are absent: C, R, A, N.\n\n Let me choose ""SPIKE"" because it has a good mix.\n\n Alternatively, ""STYLE"": ends with E, uses S, T, Y, L, E. Y is less common but can be a vowel.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has Y. So maybe better to use a word with more common consonants.\n\n Considering that, I\'ll go with ""SLIPE"" (if valid): S-L-I-P-E? I\'m not sure if ""SLIPE"" is a valid word. Let me think of common words.\n\n Another common word: ""SLATE"". But wait, feedback from first guess: A is absent! So we cannot use A. Thus ""SLATE"" has A which is absent -> so we avoid.\n\n ""STOLE"": valid word? yes. Or ""STYLE"" is valid.\n\n Let\'s decide: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E.\n\n This way, we test S, T, O, L.\n\n So, the next guess is ""STOLE"".\n\n Alternatively, if we want more vowel coverage: ""POISE"" is valid? Yes. And it uses P, O, I, S, E. That covers O and I which are vowels we haven\'t tried.\n\n But note: the feedback only told us about the letters in the first guess. Since E is already known to be present and at position 5, we can use it again? Actually, we can, but it would not give new information about E. However, we might get information if there are multiple E\'s? Because if we put an E in a different position and it shows as present (-) or absent (x), that would tell us. But in ""POISE"", E is at the end so same position. We won\'t get new info about E.\n\n Actually, in ""STOLE"", E is at the end too. So same.\n\n To test for multiple E\'s, we could put E in a different position? But we don\'t know yet. And we only have 6 tries, so we might not want to risk it now.\n\n Since the word ends with E, and we haven\'t seen any other E, it\'s possible there is only one E. We can check for multiple E\'s later if needed.\n\n For now, I think ""STOLE"" is a solid choice.\n\n But note: we know the secret word doesn\'t contain A, so if we choose a word without A, it\'s good.\n\n Let\'s go with ""STOLE"".\n\n If ""STOLE"" is not acceptable for some reason, we can choose ""SPILE"" or ""SMILE"", but let me check:\n\n ""SMILE"": S, M, I, L, E -> avoids forbidden letters, and tests M and I.\n\n Why not? It has two vowels (I and ... SMILE has I and E). Actually, we already know E is in the word.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> tests K and P.\n\n I\'ll choose ""SMILE"" because it has M and I, which are common and we haven\'t tested.\n\n But wait: we have not tried S, M, I, L. That\'s four new letters.\n\n So, let me decide:\n\n Option 1: ""STOLE"" -> tests S, T, O, L.\n Option 2: ""SMILE"" -> tests S, M, I, L.\n Option 3: ""SPIKE"" -> tests S, P, I, K.\n\n They are all good.\n\n Since we know E is in the word and at the end, let\'s pick a word that has E only at the end? Actually, all these words have E only at the end.\n\n I think ""SMILE"" is a common word and uses M and I, which are important.\n\n Alternatively, we can look for a word that includes more vowels. The only vowels left are E (at end), and we haven\'t tested I, O, U. ""SMILE"" uses I, which is a vowel.\n\n I\'ll go with ""SMILE"".\n\n However, what if the word has O? We don\'t know. But we\'ll test other letters later.\n\n Since we have limited guesses, we need to maximize information. The letter M might be less common than T? Not necessarily.\n\n But note: T is a very common consonant. So maybe ""STOLE"" is better because it tests T and O.\n\n Let\'s check letter frequencies in English:\n\n Common consonants after the ones we eliminated: S, T, L, D, U, G, B, M, P, etc.\n\n So T is more common than M.\n\n Therefore, perhaps ""STOLE"" is better: it tests T (very common) and O (common vowel).\n\n Also, L is common.\n\n So let me change to ""STOLE"".\n\n Final decision: ""STOLE"".\n\n<guess>stole</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- E is correct and in position 5 (✓), meaning the secret word ends with E.  \n- C, R, A, N are absent (x), so they can be eliminated.  \n\nFor the second guess:  \n- Must end with E (position 5).  \n- Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.  \n- Prioritize common unresolved letters like S, T, O, L, M, P, I, etc., to maximize information.  \n\nAfter evaluating options like ""SMILE"" (tests M, I), ""SPIKE"" (tests P, K), and ""STOLE"" (tests T, O), I selected ""STOLE"" because:  \n- It tests high-frequency consonants (T, S, L) and a common vowel (O).  \n- All letters are untested except E (which is fixed in position 5).  \n- It follows the format _ _ _ _ E.  \n\nIf ""STOLE"" is invalid, fallbacks could include ""SMILE"" or ""POISE"", but ""STOLE"" is a strong choice here.\n\n<guess>stole</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""We have two pieces of feedback:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nInterpretation:\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).\n- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\nGuess 2: stole -> Feedback: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)\nInterpretation:\n- S, T, O, E are correct and in the correct positions.

Wait, the feedback for L is x, meaning the letter L is not in the word at all. Because if it were in the word but wrong position, it would be marked with '-'. So L is not in the word.\n- Also, from guess 1, we know that C, R, A, N are absent.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is S T O ? E, and the fourth letter (position 4) must be a letter that:\n- Is not C, R, A, N, or L.\n- It could be any other letter except those.\n\nWe only need to guess the fourth letter.\n\nLet's list all possible 5-letter words of the form S T O _ E.\n\nWe must choose a word that fits the pattern and uses only letters that are not eliminated.\n\nEliminated letters so far: C, R, A, N, L.\n\nWe need to find a word: S T O ? E.\n\nPossible words:\n- STOKE (K is not eliminated)\n- STONE (but N is eliminated by the first guess?

Not sure about validity.\n\nWe must use valid English words.\n\nCommon words:\n- STOKE: to add fuel to (a fire). Valid.\n- STOPE: an excavation in a mine. It might be less common but valid.\n- STOVE: a device for heating or cooking. Valid.\n- STOPE and STOVE have the letter O in position 3? Yes, O is fixed.\n\nAlso, note that we must avoid L as well.\n\nSo possible words: STOKE, STOVE, and perhaps others.\n\nWhat about STYME? Not sure. Or STAGE? But G would be new, but also A is eliminated (first guess A(x)).\n\nSTAGE has A, which is eliminated.\n\nAnother: STONE: has N, eliminated.\n\nSTORE: has R, eliminated.\n\nSTOLE: we guessed and L is eliminated.\n\nSo remaining options: STOKE, STOVE, and perhaps STOPE.\n\nBut STOPE is a valid word: a step-like excavation in mining.\n\nAlso, could there be STOKE and STOVE.\n\nNow, we need to guess one of them. But we have no further information. We have only one unknown letter.\n\nWe can guess STOKE or STOVE arbitrarily? But note, we have 6 total guesses, and this is the third guess.\n\nWe can also use a word that tests other letters? But we already know the entire word except the fourth letter. The unknown is a single letter.\n\nBut we can't introduce extra letters? Because we have to form a word.\n\nAlternatively, we could guess a word that contains the pattern STO?E but also includes other letters? That doesn't make sense because we know positions 1,2,3,5 are fixed. So the word must be STO?E.\n\nTherefore, the only possibilities are words fitting STO?E that are valid and don't use eliminated letters.\n\nSo let's list:\n\n- STOKE\n- STOVE\n- STOPE\n\nAre there others?\n\n- STARE: but A is eliminated and R is eliminated? A and R are out? STARE has A and R -> eliminated.\n- STYLE: but Y is available? But L is in position 4? L is eliminated. So STYLE has L -> L is eliminated (marked absent in guess 2). So no L.\n- STUKE: is that a word? Not common.\n- So we have STOKE, STOVE, STOPE.\n\nWe need to guess one. How to differentiate? We don't have any way. We must guess one of them.\n\nBut note: we have not eliminated K, P, V. They are all still possible.\n\nSo we must guess arbitrarily? Or we can think about common words.\n\nLikely words: STOKE and STOVE are more common than STOPE.\n\nBetween STOKE and STOVE, STOVE is a very common word.\n\nSo we might guess STOVE? Also, STOVE uses V, which is less common than K? But we don't know.\n\nBut we must return a guess.\n\nWe could also use a word that doesn't follow the pattern? But that would be inefficient because we already know S,T,O,E are fixed. Why not guess the word directly?\n\nFor example, we can guess STOKE to test if K is present.\n\nBut we are trying to get the secret word by guessing one of the candidates.\n\nSo I think STOVE is a good candidate to guess.\n\nAlternatively, to maximize information: but since we know the pattern, there is no new information to get. We have to fill the blank.\n\nSo let's guess STOVE.\n\nIf it's wrong, we can try STOKE next.\n\nSince we have many guesses left (6 total, this is third).\n\nBut let me check: after STOVE, we get feedback on V.\n\nIf V is correct, we have the word. If not, then we know it's STOKE or STOPE.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess STOKE and K is correct, done. If not, then STOVE or STOPE.\n\nBut STOPE and STOVE both have O? In position 3? Wait, O is already fixed? So STOVE: positions - S(1), T(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). Similarly, STOPE: S(1), T(2), O(3), P(4), E(5). But in STOPE, the fourth letter is P?\n\nWait, spelling: STOPE is S-T-O-P-E? So five letters: positions 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:P, 5:E.\n\nSimilarly, STOVE: S-T-O-V-E.\n\nSTOKE: S-T-O-K-E.\n\nSo they differ only in position 4: either K, V, or P.\n\nWe have no additional information to narrow down K, V, P.\n\nSo we must guess one.\n\nGiven that STOVE is a common household appliance, it might be more likely? But we don't know the pool.\n\nIn Wordle, common words are more probable.\n\nTherefore, I'll guess STOVE.\n\nBut what about the letter frequency? K, V, P: P is more common? But we don't know.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the first guess: we didn't have any of these letters? But that doesn't help.\n\nSince time is limited, we'll guess STOVE.\n\nSo the next word: STOVE.\n\nBut note: in guess 2, we used STOLE, which had L. STOVE has V which we never used before.\n\nSimilarly, STOKE has K.\n\nSo both are fine.\n\nGuess: STOVE\n\nBut let's confirm: STOVE is a valid 5-letter word? Yes.\n\nTherefore:Based on the previous feedback:  \n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)`  \n  - E is in the secret word at position 5.  \n  - C, R, A, and N are not in the word.  \n- **Guess 2: stole** → Feedback: `S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)`  \n  - S, T, O, and E (position 5) are correct and in position.  \n  - L is absent.  \n- Secret word must be in the format `S T O ? E` (positions 1–3 and 5 fixed).  \n- Missing letter at position 4 must not be L, C, R, A, or N (all eliminated).  \n- Possible words: `STOKE`, `STOVE`, `STOPE` (only common valid English options).  \n- Selected **STOVE** as it is a common word.\n\n<guess>stove</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: stove -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback:
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is correct and in the last position (5). C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)
Meaning: S, T, O, E are correct and in their positions? Specifically:
  S in position 1: correct
  T in position 2: correct
  O in position 3: correct
  L in position 4: not in the word at all (since 'x')
  E in position 5: correct (already known)

So we know the secret word is S T O ? E, where the fourth letter is not L (and also not C, R, A, N).

Guess 3: stove -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)
Meaning: S, T, O, E are again correct (as expected). V in position 4 is marked 'x', meaning V is not in the word at all.

Therefore, we now know:
- Secret word is S T O ? E
- The missing letter (position 4) cannot be: L, V, C, R, A, N (from the feedback of guess1, guess2, and guess3).

We need to find a letter for the fourth position that is not in the eliminated letters and forms a valid English word.

Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, L, V.

What letters are possible? We need a letter that can form a word with ""STO_E"".

Common words:
- STOKE: with K -> not eliminated yet.
- STOPE: with P -> not eliminated.
- STYLE? But L is eliminated? No, style has L which is already eliminated.
- STONE? N eliminated.
- STORE? R eliminated.
- STAKE? A eliminated? A is eliminated (from guess1: A(x)), and also that would be two words: STAKE? But position 3 is O, so STAKE has A in position 3? No, STAKE is S-T-A-K-E. But we need O in position 3? So not matching pattern.

So the pattern is fixed: S T O ? E.

Therefore, possible words are:
- STOKE (if K is valid) -> word exists: to add fuel.
- STOPE (if P is valid) -> word exists: a step-like excavation in mining.

Are there others?
- STOME? Not really a word.
- STOZE? Not a word.
- STOKE and STOPE are the main ones.

We haven't tried K or P.

So for the next guess, we need to choose between STOKE and STOPE.

But note: we have 6 total guesses. This is guess 4, so we have two left.

We can also think if there are other words? For example, STYME? But not a common word and not valid? Or STOVE was tried and V eliminated.

Another: STOLE we tried and L eliminated.

So realistically, STOKE and STOPE.

How to decide?
We might pick STOKE arbitrarily? Or we can consider common letters.

K is more common than P? But we don't know.

Since no additional information, we try STOKE.

But note: if we guess STOKE and it's wrong, then the word must be STOPE (if we assume only two possibilities).

We have guesses left: after this, guess 5 would be STOPE if needed.

So let's guess STOKE.

But what if there are other words? Let me double-check:

We need a 5-letter word: first three letters STO, last letter E, and the fourth letter is not eliminated.

Possible fourth letters: any letter except C,R,A,N,L,V.

So letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Only K and P form common words: STOKE, STOPE.

Therefore, must be one of these two.

We guess STOKE for the fourth guess.

If it's correct, we're done. If not, then we guess STOPE next.

So the fourth guess: STOKE

If STOKE gets:
  S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) K(?) E(✓)

If K is correct, done. If K is marked 'x' or '-', but it should be 'x' if not present? Because it's the only unknown.

But if it's STOKE and the word is STOKE, then K would be ✓? Or wait, feedback: position-wise.

If the word is STOKE, then K in position 4 would be ✓.

If the word is STOPE, then K would be absent -> 'x', and we would know it's STOPE.

Therefore, we can distinguish.

So guess STOKE.
</think>
Based on the accumulated feedback:  
- **Guess 1: crane**: Eliminated C, R, A, N; E is correct at position 5.  
- **Guess 2: stole**: Confirmed S (position 1 ✓), T (position 2 ✓), O (position 3 ✓), E (position 5 ✓); eliminated L.  
- **Guess 3: stove**: Confirmed S, T, O, E positions; eliminated V.  
- Secret word is **S T O ? E**, where ""?"" is the unknown letter at position 4.  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, L, V.  
- Remaining possibilities for position 4: Uncommon letters like K, P, B, D, etc., but only **K (STOKE)** and **P (STOPE)** form valid English words.  
- **STOKE** is prioritized as a slightly more common word than STOPE (based on frequency in English usage).  

If STOKE is incorrect (K absent/x), the answer must be STOPE. Given remaining guesses (4 of 6), this maximizes efficiency.  

<guess>stoke</guess>",stoke,"We have the following feedback:
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is correct and in the last position (5). C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) L(x) E(✓)
Meaning: S, T, O, E are correct and in their positions? Specifically:
  S in position 1: correct
  T in position 2: correct
  O in position 3: correct
  L in position 4: not in the word at all (since 'x')
  E in position 5: correct (already known)

So we know the secret word is S T O ? E, where the fourth letter is not L (and also not C, R, A, N).

Guess 3: stove -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)
Meaning: S, T, O, E are again correct (as expected). V in position 4 is marked 'x', meaning V is not in the word at all.

Therefore, we now know:
- Secret word is S T O ? E
- The missing letter (position 4) cannot be: L, V, C, R, A, N (from the feedback of guess1, guess2, and guess3).

We need to find a letter for the fourth position that is not in the eliminated letters and forms a valid English word.

Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, L, V.

What letters are possible? We need a letter that can form a word with ""STO_E"".

Common words:
- STOKE: with K -> not eliminated yet.
- STOPE: with P -> not eliminated.
- STYLE? But L is eliminated? No, style has L which is already eliminated.
- STONE? N eliminated.
- STORE? R eliminated.
- STAKE? A eliminated? A is eliminated (from guess1: A(x)), and also that would be two words: STAKE? But position 3 is O, so STAKE has A in position 3? No, STAKE is S-T-A-K-E. But we need O in position 3? So not matching pattern.

So the pattern is fixed: S T O ? E.

Therefore, possible words are:
- STOKE (if K is valid) -> word exists: to add fuel.
- STOPE (if P is valid) -> word exists: a step-like excavation in mining.

Are there others?
- STOME? Not really a word.
- STOZE? Not a word.
- STOKE and STOPE are the main ones.

We haven't tried K or P.

So for the next guess, we need to choose between STOKE and STOPE.

But note: we have 6 total guesses. This is guess 4, so we have two left.

We can also think if there are other words? For example, STYME? But not a common word and not valid? Or STOVE was tried and V eliminated.

Another: STOLE we tried and L eliminated.

So realistically, STOKE and STOPE.

How to decide?
We might pick STOKE arbitrarily? Or we can consider common letters.

K is more common than P? But we don't know.

Since no additional information, we try STOKE.

But note: if we guess STOKE and it's wrong, then the word must be STOPE (if we assume only two possibilities).

We have guesses left: after this, guess 5 would be STOPE if needed.

So let's guess STOKE.

But what if there are other words? Let me double-check:

We need a 5-letter word: first three letters STO, last letter E, and the fourth letter is not eliminated.

Possible fourth letters: any letter except C,R,A,N,L,V.

So letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Only K and P form common words: STOKE, STOPE.

Therefore, must be one of these two.

We guess STOKE for the fourth guess.

If it's correct, we're done. If not, then we guess STOPE next.

So the fourth guess: STOKE

If STOKE gets:
  S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) K(?) E(✓)

If K is correct, done. If K is marked 'x' or '-', but it should be 'x' if not present? Because it's the only unknown.

But if it's STOKE and the word is STOKE, then K would be ✓? Or wait, feedback: position-wise.

If the word is STOKE, then K in position 4 would be ✓.

If the word is STOPE, then K would be absent -> 'x', and we would know it's STOPE.

Therefore, we can distinguish.

So guess STOKE.Based on the accumulated feedback:  
- **Guess 1: crane**: Eliminated C, R, A, N; E is correct at position 5.  
- **Guess 2: stole**: Confirmed S (position 1 ✓), T (position 2 ✓), O (position 3 ✓), E (position 5 ✓); eliminated L.  
- **Guess 3: stove**: Confirmed S, T, O, E positions; eliminated V.  
- Secret word is **S T O ? E**, where ""?"" is the unknown letter at position 4.  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, L, V.  
- Remaining possibilities for position 4: Uncommon letters like K, P, B, D, etc., but only **K (STOKE)** and **P (STOPE)** form valid English words.
