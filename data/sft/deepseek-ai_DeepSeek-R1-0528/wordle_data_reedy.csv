First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I don't have any prior feedback, I should start with a word that maximizes the information I can get. That means choosing a word with common letters and no repeating letters to cover more possibilities.

I recall that in games like Wordle, good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. For example, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROBIN"" are commonly used because they contain frequent letters.

Let me list out some common vowels and consonants in English 5-letter words:
- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but I'll avoid it for now)
- Consonants: R, T, N, S, L, C, D, M, etc.

A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants to cover different possibilities. I should avoid words with repeated letters because that reduces the amount of unique information I get.

Possible words:
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E → covers C, R, A, N, E. All unique letters.
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E → S, L, A, T, E. Also good.
- AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O → lots of vowels, but might not cover common consonants well.
- STERN: S, T, E, R, N → solid.

Another one I've heard is ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E → includes R, A, I, S, E.

I think ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it has common letters and no repeats.

But let me confirm the rules: I need a valid 5-letter English word. All these are valid.

To be systematic, I can choose a word that includes letters that appear frequently in English words. According to sources, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, etc.

So, incorporating those:
- ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E → covers I, R, A, T, E.
- ""ORATE"": O, R, A, T, E.
- ""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U → many vowels, but D and U are less common.

""ADIEU"" is good for vowels, but consonants might be better to include.

Perhaps ""SLANT"": S, L, A, N, T.

I think ""CRANE"" is fine.

But let's pick one. I'll go with ""RAISE"" for now. R, A, I, S, E are all very common.

After this guess, I'll get feedback like ✓, -, or x for each position, which will help me narrow down the possibilities.

Since it's the first guess, I don't overthink it.

So, my first guess: RAISE.

In the response format, I need to think step by step in </think> tags, then output the guess.

First, I'll think: I'm starting with ""RAISE"" because it contains common letters like R, A, I, S, E, which are frequent in English words, and it has no repeating letters, which helps in getting more information from the feedback.
</think>
For my first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that maximizes information gain. Since I have no prior feedback, I should select a word with common letters and no repeats to cover a broad range of possibilities. Common vowels like A, E, I and consonants like R, S are good choices. A word like ""RAISE"" is ideal because:
- It contains R, A, I, S, E—all high-frequency letters in English.
- Each letter is unique, so feedback on each position will be clear.
- This word is a valid English word, so it adheres to the rules.

After this guess, the feedback will help me identify correct letters and positions for subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"":
 - R: ✓ (correct letter and position)
 - A: x (not in the word)
 - I: x (not in the word)
 - S: x (not in the word)
 - E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter R is in the word and at the first position.
 - The letters A, I, S are not in the word at all.
 - The letter E is somewhere in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 We also have used 1 guess and have 5 tries left.

 The secret word:
 - Starts with R: so pattern is R _ _ _ _
 - Contains E (but not in the 5th position) and does not contain A, I, S.
 - Therefore, the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding A, I, S (and also excluding R and E that we know about, though E is in the word but elsewhere).

 Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

 Now, for the next guess:
 - We must form a valid 5-letter word starting with R (since the first position is confirmed).
 - We must include E in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4 (to help locate it) and avoid letters A, I, S.
 - We can also include other common letters to test for presence.

 Considering the constraints, let's choose a word that:
   - Starts with R
   - Has E in position 2, 3, or 4 (we'll try position 3 for example to see)
   - Uses other letters we haven't ruled out, like N, T, L, O, U, etc.

 Example: ""REBEL"" is not good because E is in position 2 and 4, but we don't want redundant E? Also we know E is present once? Wait, the secret word might have multiple Es? The feedback only shows that at least one E exists. But in ""raise"" we have one E and the feedback says E is present but not in the fifth position. However, we don't know if there are multiple Es.

 But note: the word must not contain A, I, S.

 However, ""REBEL"" contains E twice and we don't know if the word has two Es. Also, it uses B and L? But we don't know about them.

 Alternatively, let's try ""RECUT"": but does it have E? It has E in position 2, but then C and U and T? However, we might avoid uncommon letters? 

 Actually, we should choose a word that maximizes new information and uses common letters.

 Another idea: ""RODEO"" but contains O twice? And has A? No, RODEO does not have A? Actually, RODEO doesn't contain A, I, S? But wait: RODEO has O twice? And we don't know if doubles are allowed? But the secret word might have repeated letters? The feedback so far doesn't suggest that the word has doubles? Since we only have R and E as known letters.

 Let me think of words that start with R and include E (not fifth) and avoid A, I, S.

 Common options:
   - ""ROUTE"": R then O, U, T, E -> E is in fifth, but we know E is not in fifth. So we must avoid fifth position for E? Exactly. We need E in position 2, 3, or 4.

   - ""REACH"": but has A -> invalid because A is not present (as per feedback: A is x, meaning A is not in the word). So we must avoid A.

   - Words without A, I, S: so letters to choose from: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   - And we must include E (somewhere in positions 2-4).

   Suggestions:
      ""REBEL"": E is at positions 2 and 4? But we don't know if the word has two Es? And we don't know if we can get extra information? However, we don't have information for letters B and L.

      ""RENEW"": E at 2 and 4? Same issue.

      ""RETCH"": E in position 2, then T, C, H? That might work.

      ""RENAL"": but N, A? Wait, A is excluded. ""RENAL"" has A? So no.

      ""REVEL"": E at 2 and 4? Also V and L.

 How about ""ROTATE""? But has A? Not allowed.

 Wait, note: we know the word does not have A, I, S.

 Let me suggest: ""RINSE"" -> but I? We cannot use I because we know I is not present.

 Actually, we must avoid I as well.

 Another word: ""RESET"" -> but S? Feedback said S is not present. So we must avoid S? Exactly. So ""RESET"" is not allowed because it has S.

 What about ""REVEL""? Let's check: R, E, V, E, L? Doesn't have A, I, S? So it's okay? But we have E twice. But the secret word might only have one E? We don't know. But we can get feedback for E twice? However, if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E's will get a '✓' or '-' and the other will get an 'x'? Actually, we'll see.

 But we have to get letters we haven't tested yet.

 Alternatively, to avoid multiple E's, we could choose a word with E in a new position and four new letters? But we have to use E because we know it's in the word somewhere (but not at the start and not at the end? Wait, start is R, so E is in the middle).

 Choice: ""ROBED"" -> R, O, B, E, D? E is in fourth position? And avoids A, I, S? Yes.

 But we could also try ""RULED"": R, U, L, E, D? Also avoids A, I, S? Yes.

 However, note: the feedback from the first guess: R is first, E is not fifth. So in ""RULED"", E is fifth? Wait no: positions: 
   R (pos1), U (pos2), L (pos3), E (pos4), D (pos5). But we know E cannot be in fifth? Actually, the feedback for ""raise"": E at fifth position was marked as '-', meaning E is in the word but not at the fifth. So that doesn't forbid E from being at fifth? Actually, let me recheck:

 In ""raise"", the E was in the fifth position. The feedback for E: '-' meaning present but wrong position? But wait, the fifth position of ""raise"" got '-', so the secret word does have E, but not at the fifth position? Actually, the feedback symbol for E was '-', which according to the rules: 
   - : the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.

 So for E, because we put it at the fifth, but the secret word has E somewhere else? Therefore, E is in the word but not at fifth. Therefore, if we guess ""RULED"", we put E at fourth? Which is not fifth? So that is allowed? But we don't know if the secret word has E at fourth? Actually, we don't? So if we put E at fourth, we might get:

   If E is in the secret word at fourth: ✓
   If E is in the secret word but not at fourth, then -.

 But we already are sure E is present? Yes.

 However, we are trying to find where E goes.

 Also note: we must avoid using letters A, I, S.

 So, let's try to form a word without any repeated letters? Because repeated letters might complicate feedback? But not forbidden.

 Actually, we should try to use distinct letters to maximize the information? So no repeated letters.

 Since E is the only letter we know is present (besides R), we can try:

   R, and then four new distinct letters, plus E in one position 2, 3, or 4.

 But we don't want to use A, I, S. So we have lots of letters.

 Example: ""R"" + E in position 2? Then the letters for position 3,4,5 must be new? But we have to form a word.

 How about ""RETRY"": but R twice? and T and Y? Also, we know E? But then E is at position 2? Then positions 3 and 4: T, R? Wait, this word: 
   R E T R Y -> R at position 1 and 4? So double R? That might confuse? Also, the secret word may have only one R? We don't know? Feedback for R was ✓ at position 1? So if there is another R? Then we might see? But we don't have any prior indication.

 Alternatively, let's avoid repeated letters.

 Consider: ""ROUTE""? 
   - But E is at fifth? We know E is not at fifth? Because in the first guess, E was at fifth and got '-' meaning not at fifth? So if we guess E at fifth again? Then we are wasting? Because we already know E is not at fifth? Therefore, we must not put E at fifth in this next guess.

 So:

    We have three positions for E: 2, 3, 4.

 Another word: ""REPEL""? But E at positions 2 and 4? So we get E twice? Also P and L? And avoids A,I,S.

 Alternatively, ""RECUT"": 
   R (position1), E (position2), C (position3), U (position4), T (position5). 
   This has E at position 2? And no E doubled? And avoids A,I,S? Yes.

 But we don't know about C, U, T.

 Another: ""REGAL""? But G and L? Also avoids A,I,S? Actually, REGAL: has A? Wait, REGAL -> R E G A L? Oh, A at position 4? But we cannot use A? Because we know A is not in the secret word? So REGAL is invalid? Because it uses A, which we know isn't present.

 How about ""REIGN""? But has I? Invalid.

 ""RELET"": R E L E T? Avoids A,I,S? But has E doubled? Also, E in positions 2 and 4? Actually, RELET? Is that a word? I think not? Maybe RENT etc.

 For the sake of time, let me choose ""ROMEO""? But has O twice? And O? Also, is M present? And E? Wait, ""ROMEO"": R O M E O? 
   - Starts with R? Yes.
   - E is at position 4? That's valid (not fifth)? 
   - Avoids A, I, S? Yes? R, O, M, E, O? Actually, letters: R,O,M,E? And O repeated? But the word R O M E O? So is that valid? In dictionary? But the rules require valid English word? Romeo is a proper noun? Usually words should be common nouns or verbs? Let's assume it's allowed? Actually, Wordle usually allows common 5-letter words, including proper nouns? Or not? I don't recall.

 But also, the word has O repeated? We don't know if O appears twice? But that's acceptable? However, for maximizing information, repeated letters are inefficient.

 Another common word: ""ROBED"": 
   R (1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? 
   This avoids A, I, S? Yes.
   E is at position 4? So we want to test if E is at 4? If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at 4. If we get '-', then E is not at 4 but in another position? That could be 2 or 3? But note we haven't tested position 5? But we know E is not at 5? So E must be at 2 or 3? So if we put at 4 and get '-', then E is at 2 or 3? Similarly, if we put E at 4 and get ✓, then we lock position 4.

 Also, we can test letters O, B, D? 

 Alternatively, ""RULEE""? Not a word.

 I think ""ROBED"" is a reasonable choice? But let me check if it's a word? Yes, robed is an adjective meaning dressed? So acceptable.

 However, we already have R as first? Then R O B E D? Then the third position? We haven't tested? And we don't know if O, B, D are present.

 Another word: ""RECED""? No? ""RECEDE"" is 6 letters.

 How about ""REEDY""? But two E's? And Y? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? R E E D Y? So E in positions 2 and 3? Then D,Y? But we can get feedback on both E?

 Since we have limited guesses, why not focus on words that don't repeat letters? So I choose ""ROBED"".

 But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? But that's not known? But we are safe? For now, let's pick.

 Alternatively, ""RIPED""? Not a word.

 Or ""ROWED"": R O W E D? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? That's a word? ROWED: past tense of row? So acceptable.

 And letters: R, O, W, E, D? All distinct? Yes? And no repeated letters? Great.

 So with ""ROWED"":
   - R at first (we know so will be ✓)
   - O: new letter? If O is in the word? Then any position? We don't know?
   - W: new
   - E: in fourth position? Then we see what happens? 
   - D: new

 Also, we have E in fourth? So if E is in the word at fourth? We get ✓? Otherwise, we get '-'? And then we know E is at 2 or 3? So we can learn.

 But let's list:

   Position1: R (must be ✓ always)
   Position2: O -> we don't know? Could be anything? And similarly W at position3? Then E at position4? Then D at position5.

 So we get feedback for O, W, E, D? And W is not the best letter? But we can try.

 More common than W? How about ""ROTED""? Not a word? ""ROTED"" isn't a word? Or ""ROTATE"" is 6 letters? 

 ""RENTED""? Avoids A, I, S? Wait: R E N T E D? Has E twice and T? Also, E appears? But we have E at position2 and same condition? Also, length? 6 letters? Oh, RENTED is 6? 

 Actually, ""RENT""? Only 4 letters? 

 So ""ROWED"" or ""ROBED""? Or ""RULED""? ""RULED"": R U L E D? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? And distinct letters.

 ""RULED"": R (1), U(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)? 
   - E is at position4? We want to check E's position? Similar to ROBED? But with U,L instead of O,B? 

 Which one? Since we want common letters? Maybe RULED or ROBED? Both are common? 

 But note: the secret word might include one of these letters? We don't know? 

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that also tests common consonants: let's pick a word with T? Because T is very common? 

 How about ""RETCH"": 
   R (1), E(2), T(3), C(4), H(5)? 
   - This has E in position2? Which is a valid position? And avoids A,I,S? Yes? 
   - Letters: R, E, T, C, H? Distinct? Yes.

 And T is very common.

 So ""RETCH"" might be better? 

 Also, if E is at position2? We get:
   If ✓, then we know E is position2? 
   If - , then E is either position3 or 4? Because we know E is not in position5?

 So then we can lock position1 and position2? 

 Let me decide: ""RETCH"" is a valid word? Yes? Meaning to make a sharp cough sound? 

 So let's go with ""RETCH""?

 Summary of reasons for ""RETCH"":
   - Starts with R? ✔
   - Places E in position2 to test? 
   - Includes common consonants T, C, H? 
   - Avoids A, I, S? Yes.

 Thus, next guess: ""RETCH""

<guess>retch</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""raise"":
- **R** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **A**, **I**, and **S** are not in the word (x).
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
- The secret word starts with **R** (position 1).
- **E** is present but not in positions 1 or 5, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- **A**, **I**, and **S** are eliminated—avoid using these letters.
- The word contains at least **R** and **E**, with **E** misplaced.

For the next guess, prioritize:
- Starting with **R** to maintain position 1 certainty.
- Placing **E** in position 2, 3, or 4 to pinpoint its location (e.g., position 2).
- Testing new common consonants (""T"", ""C"", ""H"") to gather more information.
- Avoiding invalid letters: **A**, **I**, **S**.

**RETCH** fits perfectly:
- Valid English word (meaning to vomit or make a sharp sound).
- Starts with **R** (position 1).
- Places **E** in position 2 (tests if **E** is in position 2).
- Introduces new letters (**T**, **C**, **H**)—allowing feedback on their presence/position.
- No **A**, **I**, or **S**, adhering to constraints.

<guess>retch</guess>",retch,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"":
 - R: ✓ (correct letter and position)
 - A: x (not in the word)
 - I: x (not in the word)
 - S: x (not in the word)
 - E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter R is in the word and at the first position.
 - The letters A, I, S are not in the word at all.
 - The letter E is somewhere in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 We also have used 1 guess and have 5 tries left.

 The secret word:
 - Starts with R: so pattern is R _ _ _ _
 - Contains E (but not in the 5th position) and does not contain A, I, S.
 - Therefore, the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding A, I, S (and also excluding R and E that we know about, though E is in the word but elsewhere).

 Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

 Now, for the next guess:
 - We must form a valid 5-letter word starting with R (since the first position is confirmed).
 - We must include E in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4 (to help locate it) and avoid letters A, I, S.
 - We can also include other common letters to test for presence.

 Considering the constraints, let's choose a word that:
   - Starts with R
   - Has E in position 2, 3, or 4 (we'll try position 3 for example to see)
   - Uses other letters we haven't ruled out, like N, T, L, O, U, etc.

 Example: ""REBEL"" is not good because E is in position 2 and 4, but we don't want redundant E? Also we know E is present once? Wait, the secret word might have multiple Es? The feedback only shows that at least one E exists. But in ""raise"" we have one E and the feedback says E is present but not in the fifth position. However, we don't know if there are multiple Es.

 But note: the word must not contain A, I, S.

 However, ""REBEL"" contains E twice and we don't know if the word has two Es. Also, it uses B and L? But we don't know about them.

 Alternatively, let's try ""RECUT"": but does it have E? It has E in position 2, but then C and U and T? However, we might avoid uncommon letters? 

 Actually, we should choose a word that maximizes new information and uses common letters.

 Another idea: ""RODEO"" but contains O twice? And has A? No, RODEO does not have A? Actually, RODEO doesn't contain A, I, S? But wait: RODEO has O twice? And we don't know if doubles are allowed? But the secret word might have repeated letters? The feedback so far doesn't suggest that the word has doubles? Since we only have R and E as known letters.

 Let me think of words that start with R and include E (not fifth) and avoid A, I, S.

 Common options:
   - ""ROUTE"": R then O, U, T, E -> E is in fifth, but we know E is not in fifth. So we must avoid fifth position for E? Exactly. We need E in position 2, 3, or 4.

   - ""REACH"": but has A -> invalid because A is not present (as per feedback: A is x, meaning A is not in the word). So we must avoid A.

   - Words without A, I, S: so letters to choose from: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   - And we must include E (somewhere in positions 2-4).

   Suggestions:
      ""REBEL"": E is at positions 2 and 4? But we don't know if the word has two Es? And we don't know if we can get extra information? However, we don't have information for letters B and L.

      ""RENEW"": E at 2 and 4? Same issue.

      ""RETCH"": E in position 2, then T, C, H? That might work.

      ""RENAL"": but N, A? Wait, A is excluded. ""RENAL"" has A? So no.

      ""REVEL"": E at 2 and 4? Also V and L.

 How about ""ROTATE""? But has A? Not allowed.

 Wait, note: we know the word does not have A, I, S.

 Let me suggest: ""RINSE"" -> but I? We cannot use I because we know I is not present.

 Actually, we must avoid I as well.

 Another word: ""RESET"" -> but S? Feedback said S is not present. So we must avoid S? Exactly. So ""RESET"" is not allowed because it has S.

 What about ""REVEL""? Let's check: R, E, V, E, L? Doesn't have A, I, S? So it's okay? But we have E twice. But the secret word might only have one E? We don't know. But we can get feedback for E twice? However, if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E's will get a '✓' or '-' and the other will get an 'x'? Actually, we'll see.

 But we have to get letters we haven't tested yet.

 Alternatively, to avoid multiple E's, we could choose a word with E in a new position and four new letters? But we have to use E because we know it's in the word somewhere (but not at the start and not at the end? Wait, start is R, so E is in the middle).

 Choice: ""ROBED"" -> R, O, B, E, D? E is in fourth position? And avoids A, I, S? Yes.

 But we could also try ""RULED"": R, U, L, E, D? Also avoids A, I, S? Yes.

 However, note: the feedback from the first guess: R is first, E is not fifth. So in ""RULED"", E is fifth? Wait no: positions: 
   R (pos1), U (pos2), L (pos3), E (pos4), D (pos5). But we know E cannot be in fifth? Actually, the feedback for ""raise"": E at fifth position was marked as '-', meaning E is in the word but not at the fifth. So that doesn't forbid E from being at fifth? Actually, let me recheck:

 In ""raise"", the E was in the fifth position. The feedback for E: '-' meaning present but wrong position? But wait, the fifth position of ""raise"" got '-', so the secret word does have E, but not at the fifth position? Actually, the feedback symbol for E was '-', which according to the rules: 
   - : the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.

 So for E, because we put it at the fifth, but the secret word has E somewhere else? Therefore, E is in the word but not at fifth. Therefore, if we guess ""RULED"", we put E at fourth? Which is not fifth? So that is allowed? But we don't know if the secret word has E at fourth? Actually, we don't? So if we put E at fourth, we might get:

   If E is in the secret word at fourth: ✓
   If E is in the secret word but not at fourth, then -.

 But we already are sure E is present? Yes.

 However, we are trying to find where E goes.

 Also note: we must avoid using letters A, I, S.

 So, let's try to form a word without any repeated letters? Because repeated letters might complicate feedback? But not forbidden.

 Actually, we should try to use distinct letters to maximize the information? So no repeated letters.

 Since E is the only letter we know is present (besides R), we can try:

   R, and then four new distinct letters, plus E in one position 2, 3, or 4.

 But we don't want to use A, I, S. So we have lots of letters.

 Example: ""R"" + E in position 2? Then the letters for position 3,4,5 must be new? But we have to form a word.

 How about ""RETRY"": but R twice? and T and Y? Also, we know E? But then E is at position 2? Then positions 3 and 4: T, R? Wait, this word: 
   R E T R Y -> R at position 1 and 4? So double R? That might confuse? Also, the secret word may have only one R? We don't know? Feedback for R was ✓ at position 1? So if there is another R? Then we might see? But we don't have any prior indication.

 Alternatively, let's avoid repeated letters.

 Consider: ""ROUTE""? 
   - But E is at fifth? We know E is not at fifth? Because in the first guess, E was at fifth and got '-' meaning not at fifth? So if we guess E at fifth again? Then we are wasting? Because we already know E is not at fifth? Therefore, we must not put E at fifth in this next guess.

 So:

    We have three positions for E: 2, 3, 4.

 Another word: ""REPEL""? But E at positions 2 and 4? So we get E twice? Also P and L? And avoids A,I,S.

 Alternatively, ""RECUT"": 
   R (position1), E (position2), C (position3), U (position4), T (position5). 
   This has E at position 2? And no E doubled? And avoids A,I,S? Yes.

 But we don't know about C, U, T.

 Another: ""REGAL""? But G and L? Also avoids A,I,S? Actually, REGAL: has A? Wait, REGAL -> R E G A L? Oh, A at position 4? But we cannot use A? Because we know A is not in the secret word? So REGAL is invalid? Because it uses A, which we know isn't present.

 How about ""REIGN""? But has I? Invalid.

 ""RELET"": R E L E T? Avoids A,I,S? But has E doubled? Also, E in positions 2 and 4? Actually, RELET? Is that a word? I think not? Maybe RENT etc.

 For the sake of time, let me choose ""ROMEO""? But has O twice? And O? Also, is M present? And E? Wait, ""ROMEO"": R O M E O? 
   - Starts with R? Yes.
   - E is at position 4? That's valid (not fifth)? 
   - Avoids A, I, S? Yes? R, O, M, E, O? Actually, letters: R,O,M,E? And O repeated? But the word R O M E O? So is that valid? In dictionary? But the rules require valid English word? Romeo is a proper noun? Usually words should be common nouns or verbs? Let's assume it's allowed? Actually, Wordle usually allows common 5-letter words, including proper nouns? Or not? I don't recall.

 But also, the word has O repeated? We don't know if O appears twice? But that's acceptable? However, for maximizing information, repeated letters are inefficient.

 Another common word: ""ROBED"": 
   R (1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? 
   This avoids A, I, S? Yes.
   E is at position 4? So we want to test if E is at 4? If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at 4. If we get '-', then E is not at 4 but in another position? That could be 2 or 3? But note we haven't tested position 5? But we know E is not at 5? So E must be at 2 or 3? So if we put at 4 and get '-', then E is at 2 or 3? Similarly, if we put E at 4 and get ✓, then we lock position 4.

 Also, we can test letters O, B, D? 

 Alternatively, ""RULEE""? Not a word.

 I think ""ROBED"" is a reasonable choice? But let me check if it's a word? Yes, robed is an adjective meaning dressed? So acceptable.

 However, we already have R as first? Then R O B E D? Then the third position? We haven't tested? And we don't know if O, B, D are present.

 Another word: ""RECED""? No? ""RECEDE"" is 6 letters.

 How about ""REEDY""? But two E's? And Y? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? R E E D Y? So E in positions 2 and 3? Then D,Y? But we can get feedback on both E?

 Since we have limited guesses, why not focus on words that don't repeat letters? So I choose ""ROBED"".

 But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? But that's not known? But we are safe? For now, let's pick.

 Alternatively, ""RIPED""? Not a word.

 Or ""ROWED"": R O W E D? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? That's a word? ROWED: past tense of row? So acceptable.

 And letters: R, O, W, E, D? All distinct? Yes? And no repeated letters? Great.

 So with ""ROWED"":
   - R at first (we know so will be ✓)
   - O: new letter? If O is in the word? Then any position? We don't know?
   - W: new
   - E: in fourth position? Then we see what happens? 
   - D: new

 Also, we have E in fourth? So if E is in the word at fourth? We get ✓? Otherwise, we get '-'? And then we know E is at 2 or 3? So we can learn.

 But let's list:

   Position1: R (must be ✓ always)
   Position2: O -> we don't know? Could be anything? And similarly W at position3? Then E at position4? Then D at position5.

 So we get feedback for O, W, E, D? And W is not the best letter? But we can try.

 More common than W? How about ""ROTED""? Not a word? ""ROTED"" isn't a word? Or ""ROTATE"" is 6 letters? 

 ""RENTED""? Avoids A, I, S? Wait: R E N T E D? Has E twice and T? Also, E appears? But we have E at position2 and same condition? Also, length? 6 letters? Oh, RENTED is 6? 

 Actually, ""RENT""? Only 4 letters? 

 So ""ROWED"" or ""ROBED""? Or ""RULED""? ""RULED"": R U L E D? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? And distinct letters.

 ""RULED"": R (1), U(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)? 
   - E is at position4? We want to check E's position? Similar to ROBED? But with U,L instead of O,B? 

 Which one? Since we want common letters? Maybe RULED or ROBED? Both are common? 

 But note: the secret word might include one of these letters? We don't know? 

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that also tests common consonants: let's pick a word with T? Because T is very common? 

 How about ""RETCH"": 
   R (1), E(2), T(3), C(4), H(5)? 
   - This has E in position2? Which is a valid position? And avoids A,I,S? Yes? 
   - Letters: R, E, T, C, H? Distinct? Yes.

 And T is very common.

 So ""RETCH"" might be better? 

 Also, if E is at position2? We get:
   If ✓, then we know E is position2? 
   If - , then E is either position3 or 4? Because we know E is not in position5?

 So then we can lock position1 and position2? 

 Let me decide: ""RETCH"" is a valid word? Yes? Meaning to make a sharp cough sound? 

 So let's go with ""RETCH""?

 Summary of reasons for ""RETCH"":
   - Starts with R? ✔
   - Places E in position2 to test? 
   - Includes common consonants T, C, H? 
   - Avoids A, I, S? Yes.

 Thus, next guess: ""RETCH""

<guess>retch</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""raise"":

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>
For my first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that maximizes information gain. Since I have no prior feedback, I should select a word with common letters and no repeats to cover a broad range of possibilities. Common vowels like A, E, I and consonants like R, S are good choices. A word like ""RAISE"" is ideal because:
- It contains R, A, I, S, E—all high-frequency letters in English.
- Each letter is unique, so feedback on each position will be clear.
- This word is a valid English word, so it adheres to the rules.

After this guess, the feedback will help me identify correct letters and positions for subsequent guesses.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"":
 - R: ✓ (correct letter and position)
 - A: x (not in the word)
 - I: x (not in the word)
 - S: x (not in the word)
 - E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter R is in the word and at the first position.
 - The letters A, I, S are not in the word at all.
 - The letter E is somewhere in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 We also have used 1 guess and have 5 tries left.

 The secret word:
 - Starts with R: so pattern is R _ _ _ _
 - Contains E (but not in the 5th position) and does not contain A, I, S.
 - Therefore, the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding A, I, S (and also excluding R and E that we know about, though E is in the word but elsewhere).

 Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

 Now, for the next guess:
 - We must form a valid 5-letter word starting with R (since the first position is confirmed).
 - We must include E in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4 (to help locate it) and avoid letters A, I, S.
 - We can also include other common letters to test for presence.

 Considering the constraints, let's choose a word that:
   - Starts with R
   - Has E in position 2, 3, or 4 (we'll try position 3 for example to see)
   - Uses other letters we haven't ruled out, like N, T, L, O, U, etc.

 Example: ""REBEL"" is not good because E is in position 2 and 4, but we don't want redundant E? Also we know E is present once? Wait, the secret word might have multiple Es? The feedback only shows that at least one E exists. But in ""raise"" we have one E and the feedback says E is present but not in the fifth position. However, we don't know if there are multiple Es.

 But note: the word must not contain A, I, S.

 However, ""REBEL"" contains E twice and we don't know if the word has two Es. Also, it uses B and L? But we don't know about them.

 Alternatively, let's try ""RECUT"": but does it have E? It has E in position 2, but then C and U and T? However, we might avoid uncommon letters? 

 Actually, we should choose a word that maximizes new information and uses common letters.

 Another idea: ""RODEO"" but contains O twice? And has A? No, RODEO does not have A? Actually, RODEO doesn't contain A, I, S? But wait: RODEO has O twice? And we don't know if doubles are allowed? But the secret word might have repeated letters? The feedback so far doesn't suggest that the word has doubles? Since we only have R and E as known letters.

 Let me think of words that start with R and include E (not fifth) and avoid A, I, S.

 Common options:
   - ""ROUTE"": R then O, U, T, E -> E is in fifth, but we know E is not in fifth. So we must avoid fifth position for E? Exactly. We need E in position 2, 3, or 4.

   - ""REACH"": but has A -> invalid because A is not present (as per feedback: A is x, meaning A is not in the word). So we must avoid A.

   - Words without A, I, S: so letters to choose from: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   - And we must include E (somewhere in positions 2-4).

   Suggestions:
      ""REBEL"": E is at positions 2 and 4? But we don't know if the word has two Es? And we don't know if we can get extra information? However, we don't have information for letters B and L.

      ""RENEW"": E at 2 and 4? Same issue.

      ""RETCH"": E in position 2, then T, C, H? That might work.

      ""RENAL"": but N, A? Wait, A is excluded. ""RENAL"" has A? So no.

      ""REVEL"": E at 2 and 4? Also V and L.

 How about ""ROTATE""? But has A? Not allowed.

 Wait, note: we know the word does not have A, I, S.

 Let me suggest: ""RINSE"" -> but I? We cannot use I because we know I is not present.

 Actually, we must avoid I as well.

 Another word: ""RESET"" -> but S? Feedback said S is not present. So we must avoid S? Exactly. So ""RESET"" is not allowed because it has S.

 What about ""REVEL""? Let's check: R, E, V, E, L? Doesn't have A, I, S? So it's okay? But we have E twice. But the secret word might only have one E? We don't know. But we can get feedback for E twice? However, if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E's will get a '✓' or '-' and the other will get an 'x'? Actually, we'll see.

 But we have to get letters we haven't tested yet.

 Alternatively, to avoid multiple E's, we could choose a word with E in a new position and four new letters? But we have to use E because we know it's in the word somewhere (but not at the start and not at the end? Wait, start is R, so E is in the middle).

 Choice: ""ROBED"" -> R, O, B, E, D? E is in fourth position? And avoids A, I, S? Yes.

 But we could also try ""RULED"": R, U, L, E, D? Also avoids A, I, S? Yes.

 However, note: the feedback from the first guess: R is first, E is not fifth. So in ""RULED"", E is fifth? Wait no: positions: 
   R (pos1), U (pos2), L (pos3), E (pos4), D (pos5). But we know E cannot be in fifth? Actually, the feedback for ""raise"": E at fifth position was marked as '-', meaning E is in the word but not at the fifth. So that doesn't forbid E from being at fifth? Actually, let me recheck:

 In ""raise"", the E was in the fifth position. The feedback for E: '-' meaning present but wrong position? But wait, the fifth position of ""raise"" got '-', so the secret word does have E, but not at the fifth position? Actually, the feedback symbol for E was '-', which according to the rules: 
   - : the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.

 So for E, because we put it at the fifth, but the secret word has E somewhere else? Therefore, E is in the word but not at fifth. Therefore, if we guess ""RULED"", we put E at fourth? Which is not fifth? So that is allowed? But we don't know if the secret word has E at fourth? Actually, we don't? So if we put E at fourth, we might get:

   If E is in the secret word at fourth: ✓
   If E is in the secret word but not at fourth, then -.

 But we already are sure E is present? Yes.

 However, we are trying to find where E goes.

 Also note: we must avoid using letters A, I, S.

 So, let's try to form a word without any repeated letters? Because repeated letters might complicate feedback? But not forbidden.

 Actually, we should try to use distinct letters to maximize the information? So no repeated letters.

 Since E is the only letter we know is present (besides R), we can try:

   R, and then four new distinct letters, plus E in one position 2, 3, or 4.

 But we don't want to use A, I, S. So we have lots of letters.

 Example: ""R"" + E in position 2? Then the letters for position 3,4,5 must be new? But we have to form a word.

 How about ""RETRY"": but R twice? and T and Y? Also, we know E? But then E is at position 2? Then positions 3 and 4: T, R? Wait, this word: 
   R E T R Y -> R at position 1 and 4? So double R? That might confuse? Also, the secret word may have only one R? We don't know? Feedback for R was ✓ at position 1? So if there is another R? Then we might see? But we don't have any prior indication.

 Alternatively, let's avoid repeated letters.

 Consider: ""ROUTE""? 
   - But E is at fifth? We know E is not at fifth? Because in the first guess, E was at fifth and got '-' meaning not at fifth? So if we guess E at fifth again? Then we are wasting? Because we already know E is not at fifth? Therefore, we must not put E at fifth in this next guess.

 So:

    We have three positions for E: 2, 3, 4.

 Another word: ""REPEL""? But E at positions 2 and 4? So we get E twice? Also P and L? And avoids A,I,S.

 Alternatively, ""RECUT"": 
   R (position1), E (position2), C (position3), U (position4), T (position5). 
   This has E at position 2? And no E doubled? And avoids A,I,S? Yes.

 But we don't know about C, U, T.

 Another: ""REGAL""? But G and L? Also avoids A,I,S? Actually, REGAL: has A? Wait, REGAL -> R E G A L? Oh, A at position 4? But we cannot use A? Because we know A is not in the secret word? So REGAL is invalid? Because it uses A, which we know isn't present.

 How about ""REIGN""? But has I? Invalid.

 ""RELET"": R E L E T? Avoids A,I,S? But has E doubled? Also, E in positions 2 and 4? Actually, RELET? Is that a word? I think not? Maybe RENT etc.

 For the sake of time, let me choose ""ROMEO""? But has O twice? And O? Also, is M present? And E? Wait, ""ROMEO"": R O M E O? 
   - Starts with R? Yes.
   - E is at position 4? That's valid (not fifth)? 
   - Avoids A, I, S? Yes? R, O, M, E, O? Actually, letters: R,O,M,E? And O repeated? But the word R O M E O? So is that valid? In dictionary? But the rules require valid English word? Romeo is a proper noun? Usually words should be common nouns or verbs? Let's assume it's allowed? Actually, Wordle usually allows common 5-letter words, including proper nouns? Or not? I don't recall.

 But also, the word has O repeated? We don't know if O appears twice? But that's acceptable? However, for maximizing information, repeated letters are inefficient.

 Another common word: ""ROBED"": 
   R (1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? 
   This avoids A, I, S? Yes.
   E is at position 4? So we want to test if E is at 4? If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at 4. If we get '-', then E is not at 4 but in another position? That could be 2 or 3? But note we haven't tested position 5? But we know E is not at 5? So E must be at 2 or 3? So if we put at 4 and get '-', then E is at 2 or 3? Similarly, if we put E at 4 and get ✓, then we lock position 4.

 Also, we can test letters O, B, D? 

 Alternatively, ""RULEE""? Not a word.

 I think ""ROBED"" is a reasonable choice? But let me check if it's a word? Yes, robed is an adjective meaning dressed? So acceptable.

 However, we already have R as first? Then R O B E D? Then the third position? We haven't tested? And we don't know if O, B, D are present.

 Another word: ""RECED""? No? ""RECEDE"" is 6 letters.

 How about ""REEDY""? But two E's? And Y? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? R E E D Y? So E in positions 2 and 3? Then D,Y? But we can get feedback on both E?

 Since we have limited guesses, why not focus on words that don't repeat letters? So I choose ""ROBED"".

 But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? But that's not known? But we are safe? For now, let's pick.

 Alternatively, ""RIPED""? Not a word.

 Or ""ROWED"": R O W E D? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? That's a word? ROWED: past tense of row? So acceptable.

 And letters: R, O, W, E, D? All distinct? Yes? And no repeated letters? Great.

 So with ""ROWED"":
   - R at first (we know so will be ✓)
   - O: new letter? If O is in the word? Then any position? We don't know?
   - W: new
   - E: in fourth position? Then we see what happens? 
   - D: new

 Also, we have E in fourth? So if E is in the word at fourth? We get ✓? Otherwise, we get '-'? And then we know E is at 2 or 3? So we can learn.

 But let's list:

   Position1: R (must be ✓ always)
   Position2: O -> we don't know? Could be anything? And similarly W at position3? Then E at position4? Then D at position5.

 So we get feedback for O, W, E, D? And W is not the best letter? But we can try.

 More common than W? How about ""ROTED""? Not a word? ""ROTED"" isn't a word? Or ""ROTATE"" is 6 letters? 

 ""RENTED""? Avoids A, I, S? Wait: R E N T E D? Has E twice and T? Also, E appears? But we have E at position2 and same condition? Also, length? 6 letters? Oh, RENTED is 6? 

 Actually, ""RENT""? Only 4 letters? 

 So ""ROWED"" or ""ROBED""? Or ""RULED""? ""RULED"": R U L E D? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? And distinct letters.

 ""RULED"": R (1), U(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)? 
   - E is at position4? We want to check E's position? Similar to ROBED? But with U,L instead of O,B? 

 Which one? Since we want common letters? Maybe RULED or ROBED? Both are common? 

 But note: the secret word might include one of these letters? We don't know? 

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that also tests common consonants: let's pick a word with T? Because T is very common? 

 How about ""RETCH"": 
   R (1), E(2), T(3), C(4), H(5)? 
   - This has E in position2? Which is a valid position? And avoids A,I,S? Yes? 
   - Letters: R, E, T, C, H? Distinct? Yes.

 And T is very common.

 So ""RETCH"" might be better? 

 Also, if E is at position2? We get:
   If ✓, then we know E is position2? 
   If - , then E is either position3 or 4? Because we know E is not in position5?

 So then we can lock position1 and position2? 

 Let me decide: ""RETCH"" is a valid word? Yes? Meaning to make a sharp cough sound? 

 So let's go with ""RETCH""?

 Summary of reasons for ""RETCH"":
   - Starts with R? ✔
   - Places E in position2 to test? 
   - Includes common consonants T, C, H? 
   - Avoids A, I, S? Yes.

 Thus, next guess: ""RETCH""

<guess>retch</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""raise"":
- **R** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **A**, **I**, and **S** are not in the word (x).
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
- The secret word starts with **R** (position 1).
- **E** is present but not in positions 1 or 5, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- **A**, **I**, and **S** are eliminated—avoid using these letters.
- The word contains at least **R** and **E**, with **E** misplaced.

For the next guess, prioritize:
- Starting with **R** to maintain position 1 certainty.
- Placing **E** in position 2, 3, or 4 to pinpoint its location (e.g., position 2).
- Testing new common consonants (""T"", ""C"", ""H"") to gather more information.
- Avoiding invalid letters: **A**, **I**, **S**.

**RETCH** fits perfectly:
- Valid English word (meaning to vomit or make a sharp sound).
- Starts with **R** (position 1).
- Places **E** in position 2 (tests if **E** is in position 2).
- Introduces new letters (**T**, **C**, **H**)—allowing feedback on their presence/position.
- No **A**, **I**, or **S**, adhering to constraints.

Since I don\'t have any prior feedback, I should start with a word that maximizes the information I can get. That means choosing a word with common letters and no repeating letters to cover more possibilities.\n\nI recall that in games like Wordle, good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. For example, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROBIN"" are commonly used because they contain frequent letters.\n\nLet me list out some common vowels and consonants in English 5-letter words:\n- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but I\'ll avoid it for now)\n- Consonants: R, T, N, S, L, C, D, M, etc.\n\nA good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants to cover different possibilities. I should avoid words with repeated letters because that reduces the amount of unique information I get.\n\nPossible words:\n- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E → covers C, R, A, N, E. All unique letters.\n- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E → S, L, A, T, E. Also good.\n- AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O → lots of vowels, but might not cover common consonants well.\n- STERN: S, T, E, R, N → solid.\n\nAnother one I\'ve heard is ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E → includes R, A, I, S, E.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it has common letters and no repeats.\n\nBut let me confirm the rules: I need a valid 5-letter English word. All these are valid.\n\nTo be systematic, I can choose a word that includes letters that appear frequently in English words. According to sources, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, etc.\n\nSo, incorporating those:\n- ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E → covers I, R, A, T, E.\n- ""ORATE"": O, R, A, T, E.\n- ""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U → many vowels, but D and U are less common.\n\n""ADIEU"" is good for vowels, but consonants might be better to include.\n\nPerhaps ""SLANT"": S, L, A, N, T.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s pick one. I\'ll go with ""RAISE"" for now. R, A, I, S, E are all very common.\n\nAfter this guess, I\'ll get feedback like ✓, -, or x for each position, which will help me narrow down the possibilities.\n\nSince it\'s the first guess, I don\'t overthink it.\n\nSo, my first guess: RAISE.\n\nIn the response format, I need to think step by step intags, then output the guess.\n\nFirst, I\'ll think: I\'m starting with ""RAISE"" because it contains common letters like R, A, I, S, E, which are frequent in English words, and it has no repeating letters, which helps in getting more information from the feedback.\n</think>\nFor my first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that maximizes information gain. Since I have no prior feedback, I should select a word with common letters and no repeats to cover a broad range of possibilities. Common vowels like A, E, I and consonants like R, S are good choices. A word like ""RAISE"" is ideal because:\n- It contains R, A, I, S, E—all high-frequency letters in English.\n- Each letter is unique, so feedback on each position will be clear.\n- This word is a valid English word, so it adheres to the rules.\n\nAfter this guess, the feedback will help me identify correct letters and positions for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"":\n - R: ✓ (correct letter and position)\n - A: x (not in the word)\n - I: x (not in the word)\n - S: x (not in the word)\n - E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\n So, we know:\n - The letter R is in the word and at the first position.\n - The letters A, I, S are not in the word at all.\n - The letter E is somewhere in the word, but not in the fifth position.\n\n We also have used 1 guess and have 5 tries left.\n\n The secret word:\n - Starts with R: so pattern is R _ _ _ _\n - Contains E (but not in the 5th position) and does not contain A, I, S.\n - Therefore, the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding A, I, S (and also excluding R and E that we know about, though E is in the word but elsewhere).\n\n Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Now, for the next guess:\n - We must form a valid 5-letter word starting with R (since the first position is confirmed).\n - We must include E in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4 (to help locate it) and avoid letters A, I, S.\n - We can also include other common letters to test for presence.\n\n Considering the constraints, let\'s choose a word that:\n   - Starts with R\n   - Has E in position 2, 3, or 4 (we\'ll try position 3 for example to see)\n   - Uses other letters we haven\'t ruled out, like N, T, L, O, U, etc.\n\n Example: ""REBEL"" is not good because E is in position 2 and 4, but we don\'t want redundant E? Also we know E is present once? Wait, the secret word might have multiple Es? The feedback only shows that at least one E exists.

However, we don\'t know if there are multiple Es.\n\n But note: the word must not contain A, I, S.\n\n However, ""REBEL"" contains E twice and we don\'t know if the word has two Es.

However, we might avoid uncommon letters? \n\n Actually, we should choose a word that maximizes new information and uses common letters.\n\n Another idea: ""RODEO"" but contains O twice? And has A? No, RODEO does not have A? Actually, RODEO doesn\'t contain A, I, S? But wait: RODEO has O twice? And we don\'t know if doubles are allowed? But the secret word might have repeated letters? The feedback so far doesn\'t suggest that the word has doubles? Since we only have R and E as known letters.\n\n Let me think of words that start with R and include E (not fifth) and avoid A, I, S.\n\n Common options:\n   - ""ROUTE"": R then O, U, T, E -> E is in fifth, but we know E is not in fifth. So we must avoid fifth position for E? Exactly. We need E in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\n   - ""REACH"": but has A -> invalid because A is not present (as per feedback: A is x, meaning A is not in the word). So we must avoid A.\n\n   - Words without A, I, S: so letters to choose from: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n   - And we must include E (somewhere in positions 2-4).\n\n   Suggestions:\n      ""REBEL"": E is at positions 2 and 4? But we don\'t know if the word has two Es? And we don\'t know if we can get extra information? However, we don\'t have information for letters B and L.\n\n      ""RENEW"": E at 2 and 4? Same issue.\n\n      ""RETCH"": E in position 2, then T, C, H? That might work.\n\n      ""RENAL"": but N, A? Wait, A is excluded. ""RENAL"" has A? So no.\n\n      ""REVEL"": E at 2 and 4? Also V and L.\n\n How about ""ROTATE""? But has A? Not allowed.\n\n Wait, note: we know the word does not have A, I, S.\n\n Let me suggest: ""RINSE"" -> but I? We cannot use I because we know I is not present.\n\n Actually, we must avoid I as well.\n\n Another word: ""RESET"" -> but S? Feedback said S is not present. So we must avoid S? Exactly. So ""RESET"" is not allowed because it has S.\n\n What about ""REVEL""? Let\'s check: R, E, V, E, L? Doesn\'t have A, I, S? So it\'s okay? But we have E twice. But the secret word might only have one E? We don\'t know. But we can get feedback for E twice? However, if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E\'s will get a \'✓\' or \'-\' and the other will get an \'x\'? Actually, we\'ll see.\n\n But we have to get letters we haven\'t tested yet.\n\n Alternatively, to avoid multiple E\'s, we could choose a word with E in a new position and four new letters? But we have to use E because we know it\'s in the word somewhere (but not at the start and not at the end? Wait, start is R, so E is in the middle).\n\n Choice: ""ROBED"" -> R, O, B, E, D? E is in fourth position? And avoids A, I, S? Yes.\n\n But we could also try ""RULED"": R, U, L, E, D? Also avoids A, I, S? Yes.\n\n However, note: the feedback from the first guess: R is first, E is not fifth. So in ""RULED"", E is fifth? Wait no: positions: \n   R (pos1), U (pos2), L (pos3), E (pos4), D (pos5). But we know E cannot be in fifth? Actually, the feedback for ""raise"": E at fifth position was marked as \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not at the fifth. So that doesn\'t forbid E from being at fifth? Actually, let me recheck:\n\n In ""raise"", the E was in the fifth position. The feedback for E: \'-\' meaning present but wrong position? But wait, the fifth position of ""raise"" got \'-\', so the secret word does have E, but not at the fifth position? Actually, the feedback symbol for E was \'-\', which according to the rules: \n   - : the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.\n\n So for E, because we put it at the fifth, but the secret word has E somewhere else? Therefore, E is in the word but not at fifth. Therefore, if we guess ""RULED"", we put E at fourth? Which is not fifth? So that is allowed? But we don\'t know if the secret word has E at fourth? Actually, we don\'t? So if we put E at fourth, we might get:\n\n   If E is in the secret word at fourth: ✓\n   If E is in the secret word but not at fourth, then -.\n\n But we already are sure E is present? Yes.\n\n However, we are trying to find where E goes.\n\n Also note: we must avoid using letters A, I, S.\n\n So, let\'s try to form a word without any repeated letters? Because repeated letters might complicate feedback? But not forbidden.\n\n Actually, we should try to use distinct letters to maximize the information? So no repeated letters.\n\n Since E is the only letter we know is present (besides R), we can try:\n\n   R, and then four new distinct letters, plus E in one position 2, 3, or 4.\n\n But we don\'t want to use A, I, S. So we have lots of letters.\n\n Example: ""R"" + E in position 2? Then the letters for position 3,4,5 must be new? But we have to form a word.\n\n How about ""RETRY"": but R twice? and T and Y? Also, we know E? But then E is at position 2? Then positions 3 and 4: T, R? Wait, this word: \n   R E T R Y -> R at position 1 and 4? So double R? That might confuse? Also, the secret word may have only one R? We don\'t know? Feedback for R was ✓ at position 1? So if there is another R? Then we might see? But we don\'t have any prior indication.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s avoid repeated letters.\n\n Consider: ""ROUTE""? \n   - But E is at fifth? We know E is not at fifth? Because in the first guess, E was at fifth and got \'-\' meaning not at fifth? So if we guess E at fifth again? Then we are wasting? Because we already know E is not at fifth? Therefore, we must not put E at fifth in this next guess.\n\n So:\n\n    We have three positions for E: 2, 3, 4.\n\n Another word: ""REPEL""? But E at positions 2 and 4? So we get E twice? Also P and L? And avoids A,I,S.\n\n Alternatively, ""RECUT"": \n   R (position1), E (position2), C (position3), U (position4), T (position5). \n   This has E at position 2? And no E doubled?

Invalid.\n\n ""RELET"": R E L E T? Avoids A,I,S? But has E doubled? Also, E in positions 2 and 4? Actually, RELET? Is that a word? I think not? Maybe RENT etc.\n\n For the sake of time, let me choose ""ROMEO""? But has O twice? And O? Also, is M present? And E? Wait, ""ROMEO"": R O M E O? \n   - Starts with R? Yes.\n   - E is at position 4? That\'s valid (not fifth)? \n   - Avoids A, I, S? Yes? R, O, M, E, O? Actually, letters: R,O,M,E? And O repeated? But the word R O M E O? So is that valid? In dictionary? But the rules require valid English word? Romeo is a proper noun? Usually words should be common nouns or verbs? Let\'s assume it\'s allowed?

But note we haven\'t tested position 5? But we know E is not at 5? So E must be at 2 or 3? So if we put at 4 and get \'-\', then E is at 2 or 3? Similarly, if we put E at 4 and get ✓, then we lock position 4.\n\n Also, we can test letters O, B, D? \n\n Alternatively, ""RULEE""? Not a word.\n\n I think ""ROBED"" is a reasonable choice? But let me check if it\'s a word? Yes, robed is an adjective meaning dressed? So acceptable.\n\n However, we already have R as first? Then R O B E D? Then the third position? We haven\'t tested? And we don\'t know if O, B, D are present.\n\n Another word: ""RECED""? No? ""RECEDE"" is 6 letters.\n\n How about ""REEDY""? But two E\'s? And Y? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? R E E D Y? So E in positions 2 and 3? Then D,Y? But we can get feedback on both E?\n\n Since we have limited guesses, why not focus on words that don\'t repeat letters? So I choose ""ROBED"".\n\n But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? But that\'s not known? But we are safe? For now, let\'s pick.\n\n Alternatively, ""RIPED""? Not a word.\n\n Or ""ROWED"": R O W E D? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? That\'s a word? ROWED: past tense of row? So acceptable.\n\n And letters: R, O, W, E, D? All distinct? Yes? And no repeated letters?

We have two pieces of feedback:

From Guess 1 (""raise""):
- R ✓ (position 1 correct)
- A x (not in word)
- I x (not in word)
- S x (not in word)
- E - (in word, but not position 5)

From Guess 2 (""retch""):
- R ✓ (position 1 correct, as expected)
- E ✓ (position 2 correct! So E is now confirmed at position 2)
- T x (T not in word)
- C x (C not in word)
- H x (H not in word)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word starts with ""RE"" (positions 1 and 2 are R and E).
- We've eliminated A, I, S, T, C, H as possible letters.
- The word does not contain these letters: A, I, S, T, C, H.
- The remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding these: A, I, S, T, C, H (and including E, but it's already placed).

The secret word pattern: ""R E _ _ _""
Positions 3, 4, and 5 need to be filled with letters that are not A,I,S,T,C,H.

We also know from Guess 1 that E is in the word but not position 5. However, we now know E is at position 2, so that condition is satisfied.

We must form a 5-letter word in the pattern ""RE___"" that doesn't use A,I,S,T,C,H.

Additionally, we have unused letters to test. Common consonants like N, O, U, L, D, etc.

The word must be valid English.

To maximize information, we should test common letters in positions 3, 4, and 5.

We have 5 tries left? Wait: two guesses used, so 4 tries left? But originally 6, so after guess 2, we have 4 guesses left? But let's proceed.

We know the word starts with ""RE"". We need to guess the last three letters.

We also have eliminated several letters? So remaining letters: B,D,F,G,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and E? But E is fixed at position 2).

But E is already used? So for the remaining positions? Not? Actually, the secret word might contain repeated letters? So E could appear again? We don't know? But we have no reason to forbid doubles? However, we haven't seen doubles? But possible.

But the known letters: R and E? So if we put another E? Then in feedback we might see? For now? We can avoid? For simplicity? Or not? It's okay? Because we don't know.

But let's see: with pattern ""RE___"", we can form words.

We should choose a word that uses common letters we haven't tested? For example, we haven't tested N, L, D? etc.

Common suffixes for words that start with ""RE"": examples: ""RELAY"", but L? Then A? But A is eliminated? So ""RELAY"" invalid.

""REBEL"": E doubled? But it has B,E,L? Avoids A,I,S,T,C,H? Yes: B, E, L? Wait B, E, L? And pattern? ""REB E L""? Wait: R E B E L? Actually, ""REBEL"" has E in position 4? And E? So if we try ""REBEL"", we would have:
  Position: 1 R (✓), 2 E (✓), 3 B (testing), 4 E (testing for duplicate?), 5 L (testing?).

If the word has B? Then? Etc.

Alternatively, we can try a word with distinct new letters? So we avoid re-testing E? Since we already know E is in the word? And we don't know if it's duplicated? But we can get information? However, to maximize? Testing three new letters might be better.

Therefore, let's try a word without repeated letters? And avoid E? Or only one E? We already have E at position 2? We don't need to put E again? Unless we suspect duplication? But we have no evidence? So perhaps avoid duplicates.

Word: ""REbut""? Not five? Wait 5 letters?

""REBAR""? But A? A is invalid? No.

""REVEL"": V and L? Avoids A,I,S,T,C,H? Yes: V, E, L? But double E? Wait, ""REVEL""? Letters: R,E,V,E,L? So has E twice? Actually? It has E at position 2 and 4? So we are reusing E? But we know E? So possibly redundant? But V and L are new? So maybe.

But we get feedback on V and L? If we put E at position 4? And if the secret word has E? Then we might get ✓ for E? Or if duplicate? Then ✓ for E4? But if no duplicate? Then we get '-'? Or if E is only at 2? Then position 4 E would be wrong position? But we know E only at 2? Actually, we know it is in the word? But perhaps only at 2? So E at 4 might be extra? Then feedback for position 4? If E is not at 4 but E is in word? Then '-' for E? Because wrong position? But E is correctly placed? No? Not? Position 4? We don't know? So it can be '-?'.

Actually, the secret word might not have E at 4? Then feedback would mark E with '-' meaning it's in the word? But we already know E is in the word? So if we put E at 4, and if it's not present? Then it would be 'x'? So we can tell if E is duplicated? Or not.

But to avoid confusion? And save guesses? Use distinct letters.

Let me suggest ""REMOD""? Not a word? ""REMODEL"" too long? 

""REMOW""? Not word.

""REMUT""? Not word.

Common words: ""REIGN""? But I? I eliminated? We cannot use I? Since I is not present? And I is in ""REIGN""? So invalid.

""REPAY""? But P and A? Then A? A is invalid? So no.

""REPLY"": L and Y? Avoids A,I,S,T,C,H? Yes? Pattern: R E P L Y? Letters: R,E,P,L,Y? All distinct? No duplicates? And avoids forbidden letters? E included? But in the pattern? We are forced at positions 1 and 2? Then in ""REPLY"": position 3 P, position 4 L, position 5 Y? Perfect? 

Also ""REPLY"" is a common English word? Yes? Meaning to respond.

So with ""REPLY"", we can get feedback for:
  Position1: R (already ✓)
  Position2: E (already ✓)
  Position3: P? Is P in word? If yes? Where?
  Position4: L? Same?
  Position5: Y? Same?

Therefore, our guess: ""REPLY""

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,reedy,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>
For my first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that maximizes information gain. Since I have no prior feedback, I should select a word with common letters and no repeats to cover a broad range of possibilities. Common vowels like A, E, I and consonants like R, S are good choices. A word like ""RAISE"" is ideal because:
- It contains R, A, I, S, E—all high-frequency letters in English.
- Each letter is unique, so feedback on each position will be clear.
- This word is a valid English word, so it adheres to the rules.

After this guess, the feedback will help me identify correct letters and positions for subsequent guesses.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"":
 - R: ✓ (correct letter and position)
 - A: x (not in the word)
 - I: x (not in the word)
 - S: x (not in the word)
 - E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter R is in the word and at the first position.
 - The letters A, I, S are not in the word at all.
 - The letter E is somewhere in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 We also have used 1 guess and have 5 tries left.

 The secret word:
 - Starts with R: so pattern is R _ _ _ _
 - Contains E (but not in the 5th position) and does not contain A, I, S.
 - Therefore, the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding A, I, S (and also excluding R and E that we know about, though E is in the word but elsewhere).

 Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

 Now, for the next guess:
 - We must form a valid 5-letter word starting with R (since the first position is confirmed).
 - We must include E in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4 (to help locate it) and avoid letters A, I, S.
 - We can also include other common letters to test for presence.

 Considering the constraints, let's choose a word that:
   - Starts with R
   - Has E in position 2, 3, or 4 (we'll try position 3 for example to see)
   - Uses other letters we haven't ruled out, like N, T, L, O, U, etc.

 Example: ""REBEL"" is not good because E is in position 2 and 4, but we don't want redundant E? Also we know E is present once? Wait, the secret word might have multiple Es? The feedback only shows that at least one E exists. But in ""raise"" we have one E and the feedback says E is present but not in the fifth position. However, we don't know if there are multiple Es.

 But note: the word must not contain A, I, S.

 However, ""REBEL"" contains E twice and we don't know if the word has two Es. Also, it uses B and L? But we don't know about them.

 Alternatively, let's try ""RECUT"": but does it have E? It has E in position 2, but then C and U and T? However, we might avoid uncommon letters? 

 Actually, we should choose a word that maximizes new information and uses common letters.

 Another idea: ""RODEO"" but contains O twice? And has A? No, RODEO does not have A? Actually, RODEO doesn't contain A, I, S? But wait: RODEO has O twice? And we don't know if doubles are allowed? But the secret word might have repeated letters? The feedback so far doesn't suggest that the word has doubles? Since we only have R and E as known letters.

 Let me think of words that start with R and include E (not fifth) and avoid A, I, S.

 Common options:
   - ""ROUTE"": R then O, U, T, E -> E is in fifth, but we know E is not in fifth. So we must avoid fifth position for E? Exactly. We need E in position 2, 3, or 4.

   - ""REACH"": but has A -> invalid because A is not present (as per feedback: A is x, meaning A is not in the word). So we must avoid A.

   - Words without A, I, S: so letters to choose from: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   - And we must include E (somewhere in positions 2-4).

   Suggestions:
      ""REBEL"": E is at positions 2 and 4? But we don't know if the word has two Es? And we don't know if we can get extra information? However, we don't have information for letters B and L.

      ""RENEW"": E at 2 and 4? Same issue.

      ""RETCH"": E in position 2, then T, C, H? That might work.

      ""RENAL"": but N, A? Wait, A is excluded. ""RENAL"" has A? So no.

      ""REVEL"": E at 2 and 4? Also V and L.

 How about ""ROTATE""? But has A? Not allowed.

 Wait, note: we know the word does not have A, I, S.

 Let me suggest: ""RINSE"" -> but I? We cannot use I because we know I is not present.

 Actually, we must avoid I as well.

 Another word: ""RESET"" -> but S? Feedback said S is not present. So we must avoid S? Exactly. So ""RESET"" is not allowed because it has S.

 What about ""REVEL""? Let's check: R, E, V, E, L? Doesn't have A, I, S? So it's okay? But we have E twice. But the secret word might only have one E? We don't know. But we can get feedback for E twice? However, if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E's will get a '✓' or '-' and the other will get an 'x'? Actually, we'll see.

 But we have to get letters we haven't tested yet.

 Alternatively, to avoid multiple E's, we could choose a word with E in a new position and four new letters? But we have to use E because we know it's in the word somewhere (but not at the start and not at the end? Wait, start is R, so E is in the middle).

 Choice: ""ROBED"" -> R, O, B, E, D? E is in fourth position? And avoids A, I, S? Yes.

 But we could also try ""RULED"": R, U, L, E, D? Also avoids A, I, S? Yes.

 However, note: the feedback from the first guess: R is first, E is not fifth. So in ""RULED"", E is fifth? Wait no: positions: 
   R (pos1), U (pos2), L (pos3), E (pos4), D (pos5). But we know E cannot be in fifth? Actually, the feedback for ""raise"": E at fifth position was marked as '-', meaning E is in the word but not at the fifth. So that doesn't forbid E from being at fifth? Actually, let me recheck:

 In ""raise"", the E was in the fifth position. The feedback for E: '-' meaning present but wrong position? But wait, the fifth position of ""raise"" got '-', so the secret word does have E, but not at the fifth position? Actually, the feedback symbol for E was '-', which according to the rules: 
   - : the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.

 So for E, because we put it at the fifth, but the secret word has E somewhere else? Therefore, E is in the word but not at fifth. Therefore, if we guess ""RULED"", we put E at fourth? Which is not fifth? So that is allowed? But we don't know if the secret word has E at fourth? Actually, we don't? So if we put E at fourth, we might get:

   If E is in the secret word at fourth: ✓
   If E is in the secret word but not at fourth, then -.

 But we already are sure E is present? Yes.

 However, we are trying to find where E goes.

 Also note: we must avoid using letters A, I, S.

 So, let's try to form a word without any repeated letters? Because repeated letters might complicate feedback? But not forbidden.

 Actually, we should try to use distinct letters to maximize the information? So no repeated letters.

 Since E is the only letter we know is present (besides R), we can try:

   R, and then four new distinct letters, plus E in one position 2, 3, or 4.

 But we don't want to use A, I, S. So we have lots of letters.

 Example: ""R"" + E in position 2? Then the letters for position 3,4,5 must be new? But we have to form a word.

 How about ""RETRY"": but R twice? and T and Y? Also, we know E? But then E is at position 2? Then positions 3 and 4: T, R? Wait, this word: 
   R E T R Y -> R at position 1 and 4? So double R? That might confuse? Also, the secret word may have only one R? We don't know? Feedback for R was ✓ at position 1? So if there is another R? Then we might see? But we don't have any prior indication.

 Alternatively, let's avoid repeated letters.

 Consider: ""ROUTE""? 
   - But E is at fifth? We know E is not at fifth? Because in the first guess, E was at fifth and got '-' meaning not at fifth? So if we guess E at fifth again? Then we are wasting? Because we already know E is not at fifth? Therefore, we must not put E at fifth in this next guess.

 So:

    We have three positions for E: 2, 3, 4.

 Another word: ""REPEL""? But E at positions 2 and 4? So we get E twice? Also P and L? And avoids A,I,S.

 Alternatively, ""RECUT"": 
   R (position1), E (position2), C (position3), U (position4), T (position5). 
   This has E at position 2? And no E doubled? And avoids A,I,S? Yes.

 But we don't know about C, U, T.

 Another: ""REGAL""? But G and L? Also avoids A,I,S? Actually, REGAL: has A? Wait, REGAL -> R E G A L? Oh, A at position 4? But we cannot use A? Because we know A is not in the secret word? So REGAL is invalid? Because it uses A, which we know isn't present.

 How about ""REIGN""? But has I? Invalid.

 ""RELET"": R E L E T? Avoids A,I,S? But has E doubled? Also, E in positions 2 and 4? Actually, RELET? Is that a word? I think not? Maybe RENT etc.

 For the sake of time, let me choose ""ROMEO""? But has O twice? And O? Also, is M present? And E? Wait, ""ROMEO"": R O M E O? 
   - Starts with R? Yes.
   - E is at position 4? That's valid (not fifth)? 
   - Avoids A, I, S? Yes? R, O, M, E, O? Actually, letters: R,O,M,E? And O repeated? But the word R O M E O? So is that valid? In dictionary? But the rules require valid English word? Romeo is a proper noun? Usually words should be common nouns or verbs? Let's assume it's allowed? Actually, Wordle usually allows common 5-letter words, including proper nouns? Or not? I don't recall.

 But also, the word has O repeated? We don't know if O appears twice? But that's acceptable? However, for maximizing information, repeated letters are inefficient.

 Another common word: ""ROBED"": 
   R (1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? 
   This avoids A, I, S? Yes.
   E is at position 4? So we want to test if E is at 4? If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at 4. If we get '-', then E is not at 4 but in another position? That could be 2 or 3? But note we haven't tested position 5? But we know E is not at 5? So E must be at 2 or 3? So if we put at 4 and get '-', then E is at 2 or 3? Similarly, if we put E at 4 and get ✓, then we lock position 4.

 Also, we can test letters O, B, D? 

 Alternatively, ""RULEE""? Not a word.

 I think ""ROBED"" is a reasonable choice? But let me check if it's a word? Yes, robed is an adjective meaning dressed? So acceptable.

 However, we already have R as first? Then R O B E D? Then the third position? We haven't tested? And we don't know if O, B, D are present.

 Another word: ""RECED""? No? ""RECEDE"" is 6 letters.

 How about ""REEDY""? But two E's? And Y? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? R E E D Y? So E in positions 2 and 3? Then D,Y? But we can get feedback on both E?

 Since we have limited guesses, why not focus on words that don't repeat letters? So I choose ""ROBED"".

 But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? But that's not known? But we are safe? For now, let's pick.

 Alternatively, ""RIPED""? Not a word.

 Or ""ROWED"": R O W E D? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? That's a word? ROWED: past tense of row? So acceptable.

 And letters: R, O, W, E, D? All distinct? Yes? And no repeated letters? Great.

 So with ""ROWED"":
   - R at first (we know so will be ✓)
   - O: new letter? If O is in the word? Then any position? We don't know?
   - W: new
   - E: in fourth position? Then we see what happens? 
   - D: new

 Also, we have E in fourth? So if E is in the word at fourth? We get ✓? Otherwise, we get '-'? And then we know E is at 2 or 3? So we can learn.

 But let's list:

   Position1: R (must be ✓ always)
   Position2: O -> we don't know? Could be anything? And similarly W at position3? Then E at position4? Then D at position5.

 So we get feedback for O, W, E, D? And W is not the best letter? But we can try.

 More common than W? How about ""ROTED""? Not a word? ""ROTED"" isn't a word? Or ""ROTATE"" is 6 letters? 

 ""RENTED""? Avoids A, I, S? Wait: R E N T E D? Has E twice and T? Also, E appears? But we have E at position2 and same condition? Also, length? 6 letters? Oh, RENTED is 6? 

 Actually, ""RENT""? Only 4 letters? 

 So ""ROWED"" or ""ROBED""? Or ""RULED""? ""RULED"": R U L E D? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? And distinct letters.

 ""RULED"": R (1), U(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)? 
   - E is at position4? We want to check E's position? Similar to ROBED? But with U,L instead of O,B? 

 Which one? Since we want common letters? Maybe RULED or ROBED? Both are common? 

 But note: the secret word might include one of these letters? We don't know? 

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that also tests common consonants: let's pick a word with T? Because T is very common? 

 How about ""RETCH"": 
   R (1), E(2), T(3), C(4), H(5)? 
   - This has E in position2? Which is a valid position? And avoids A,I,S? Yes? 
   - Letters: R, E, T, C, H? Distinct? Yes.

 And T is very common.

 So ""RETCH"" might be better? 

 Also, if E is at position2? We get:
   If ✓, then we know E is position2? 
   If - , then E is either position3 or 4? Because we know E is not in position5?

 So then we can lock position1 and position2? 

 Let me decide: ""RETCH"" is a valid word? Yes? Meaning to make a sharp cough sound? 

 So let's go with ""RETCH""?

 Summary of reasons for ""RETCH"":
   - Starts with R? ✔
   - Places E in position2 to test? 
   - Includes common consonants T, C, H? 
   - Avoids A, I, S? Yes.

 Thus, next guess: ""RETCH""

<guess>retch</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""raise"":
- **R** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **A**, **I**, and **S** are not in the word (x).
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
- The secret word starts with **R** (position 1).
- **E** is present but not in positions 1 or 5, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- **A**, **I**, and **S** are eliminated—avoid using these letters.
- The word contains at least **R** and **E**, with **E** misplaced.

For the next guess, prioritize:
- Starting with **R** to maintain position 1 certainty.
- Placing **E** in position 2, 3, or 4 to pinpoint its location (e.g., position 2).
- Testing new common consonants (""T"", ""C"", ""H"") to gather more information.
- Avoiding invalid letters: **A**, **I**, **S**.

**RETCH** fits perfectly:
- Valid English word (meaning to vomit or make a sharp sound).
- Starts with **R** (position 1).
- Places **E** in position 2 (tests if **E** is in position 2).
- Introduces new letters (**T**, **C**, **H**)—allowing feedback on their presence/position.
- No **A**, **I**, or **S**, adhering to constraints.

<guess>retch</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: retch -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) T(x) C(x) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two pieces of feedback:

From Guess 1 (""raise""):
- R ✓ (position 1 correct)
- A x (not in word)
- I x (not in word)
- S x (not in word)
- E - (in word, but not position 5)

From Guess 2 (""retch""):
- R ✓ (position 1 correct, as expected)
- E ✓ (position 2 correct! So E is now confirmed at position 2)
- T x (T not in word)
- C x (C not in word)
- H x (H not in word)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word starts with ""RE"" (positions 1 and 2 are R and E).
- We've eliminated A, I, S, T, C, H as possible letters.
- The word does not contain these letters: A, I, S, T, C, H.
- The remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding these: A, I, S, T, C, H (and including E, but it's already placed).

The secret word pattern: ""R E _ _ _""
Positions 3, 4, and 5 need to be filled with letters that are not A,I,S,T,C,H.

We also know from Guess 1 that E is in the word but not position 5. However, we now know E is at position 2, so that condition is satisfied.

We must form a 5-letter word in the pattern ""RE___"" that doesn't use A,I,S,T,C,H.

Additionally, we have unused letters to test. Common consonants like N, O, U, L, D, etc.

The word must be valid English.

To maximize information, we should test common letters in positions 3, 4, and 5.

We have 5 tries left? Wait: two guesses used, so 4 tries left? But originally 6, so after guess 2, we have 4 guesses left? But let's proceed.

We know the word starts with ""RE"". We need to guess the last three letters.

We also have eliminated several letters? So remaining letters: B,D,F,G,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and E? But E is fixed at position 2).

But E is already used? So for the remaining positions? Not? Actually, the secret word might contain repeated letters? So E could appear again? We don't know? But we have no reason to forbid doubles? However, we haven't seen doubles? But possible.

But the known letters: R and E? So if we put another E? Then in feedback we might see? For now? We can avoid? For simplicity? Or not? It's okay? Because we don't know.

But let's see: with pattern ""RE___"", we can form words.

We should choose a word that uses common letters we haven't tested? For example, we haven't tested N, L, D? etc.

Common suffixes for words that start with ""RE"": examples: ""RELAY"", but L? Then A? But A is eliminated? So ""RELAY"" invalid.

""REBEL"": E doubled? But it has B,E,L? Avoids A,I,S,T,C,H? Yes: B, E, L? Wait B, E, L? And pattern? ""REB E L""? Wait: R E B E L? Actually, ""REBEL"" has E in position 4? And E? So if we try ""REBEL"", we would have:
  Position: 1 R (✓), 2 E (✓), 3 B (testing), 4 E (testing for duplicate?), 5 L (testing?).

If the word has B? Then? Etc.

Alternatively, we can try a word with distinct new letters? So we avoid re-testing E? Since we already know E is in the word? And we don't know if it's duplicated? But we can get information? However, to maximize? Testing three new letters might be better.

Therefore, let's try a word without repeated letters? And avoid E? Or only one E? We already have E at position 2? We don't need to put E again? Unless we suspect duplication? But we have no evidence? So perhaps avoid duplicates.

Word: ""REbut""? Not five? Wait 5 letters?

""REBAR""? But A? A is invalid? No.

""REVEL"": V and L? Avoids A,I,S,T,C,H? Yes: V, E, L? But double E? Wait, ""REVEL""? Letters: R,E,V,E,L? So has E twice? Actually? It has E at position 2 and 4? So we are reusing E? But we know E? So possibly redundant? But V and L are new? So maybe.

But we get feedback on V and L? If we put E at position 4? And if the secret word has E? Then we might get ✓ for E? Or if duplicate? Then ✓ for E4? But if no duplicate? Then we get '-'? Or if E is only at 2? Then position 4 E would be wrong position? But we know E only at 2? Actually, we know it is in the word? But perhaps only at 2? So E at 4 might be extra? Then feedback for position 4? If E is not at 4 but E is in word? Then '-' for E? Because wrong position? But E is correctly placed? No? Not? Position 4? We don't know? So it can be '-?'.

Actually, the secret word might not have E at 4? Then feedback would mark E with '-' meaning it's in the word? But we already know E is in the word? So if we put E at 4, and if it's not present? Then it would be 'x'? So we can tell if E is duplicated? Or not.

But to avoid confusion? And save guesses? Use distinct letters.

Let me suggest ""REMOD""? Not a word? ""REMODEL"" too long? 

""REMOW""? Not word.

""REMUT""? Not word.

Common words: ""REIGN""? But I? I eliminated? We cannot use I? Since I is not present? And I is in ""REIGN""? So invalid.

""REPAY""? But P and A? Then A? A is invalid? So no.

""REPLY"": L and Y? Avoids A,I,S,T,C,H? Yes? Pattern: R E P L Y? Letters: R,E,P,L,Y? All distinct? No duplicates? And avoids forbidden letters? E included? But in the pattern? We are forced at positions 1 and 2? Then in ""REPLY"": position 3 P, position 4 L, position 5 Y? Perfect? 

Also ""REPLY"" is a common English word? Yes? Meaning to respond.

So with ""REPLY"", we can get feedback for:
  Position1: R (already ✓)
  Position2: E (already ✓)
  Position3: P? Is P in word? If yes? Where?
  Position4: L? Same?
  Position5: Y? Same?

Therefore, our guess: ""REPLY""

<guess>reply</guess>Based on previous feedback:

- **Guess 1 (raise)**: R is correct and in position 1 (✓), A/I/S are absent (x), E is present but not in position 5 (-).  
- **Guess 2 (retch)**: R and E are correct and in positions 1 and 2 (✓), T/C/H are absent (x).  

Key deductions:  
- The secret word starts with **""RE""** (positions 1 and 2 confirmed).  
- Eliminated letters: **A, I, S, T, C, H** (cannot appear anywhere).  
- The word pattern is **""RE___""**, with positions 3–5 unknown.  
- E is confirmed at position 2; positions 3–5 must use new letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding A,I,S,T,C,H).  

For the next guess:  
- Must start with ""RE"" and adhere to the pattern ""RE___"".  
- Prioritize testing common letters not yet tried (e.g., L, N, P, D, Y) to gather maximum information.  
- ""REPLY"" fits perfectly:  
  - Valid English word (meaning to respond).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters (A,I,S,T,C,H).  
  - Tests new letters: **P** (position 3), **L** (position 4), **Y** (position 5).  
- Feedback will reveal whether P, L, or Y are in the word and their positions.

Since I don\'t have any prior feedback, I should start with a word that maximizes the information I can get. That means choosing a word with common letters and no repeating letters to cover more possibilities.\n\nI recall that in games like Wordle, good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. For example, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROBIN"" are commonly used because they contain frequent letters.\n\nLet me list out some common vowels and consonants in English 5-letter words:\n- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but I\'ll avoid it for now)\n- Consonants: R, T, N, S, L, C, D, M, etc.\n\nA good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants to cover different possibilities. I should avoid words with repeated letters because that reduces the amount of unique information I get.\n\nPossible words:\n- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E → covers C, R, A, N, E. All unique letters.\n- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E → S, L, A, T, E. Also good.\n- AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O → lots of vowels, but might not cover common consonants well.\n- STERN: S, T, E, R, N → solid.\n\nAnother one I\'ve heard is ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E → includes R, A, I, S, E.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it has common letters and no repeats.\n\nBut let me confirm the rules: I need a valid 5-letter English word. All these are valid.\n\nTo be systematic, I can choose a word that includes letters that appear frequently in English words. According to sources, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, etc.\n\nSo, incorporating those:\n- ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E → covers I, R, A, T, E.\n- ""ORATE"": O, R, A, T, E.\n- ""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U → many vowels, but D and U are less common.\n\n""ADIEU"" is good for vowels, but consonants might be better to include.\n\nPerhaps ""SLANT"": S, L, A, N, T.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s pick one.

Since I have no prior feedback, I should select a word with common letters and no repeats to cover a broad range of possibilities. Common vowels like A, E, I and consonants like R, S are good choices. A word like ""RAISE"" is ideal because:\n- It contains R, A, I, S, E—all high-frequency letters in English.\n- Each letter is unique, so feedback on each position will be clear.\n- This word is a valid English word, so it adheres to the rules.\n\nAfter this guess, the feedback will help me identify correct letters and positions for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"":\n - R: ✓ (correct letter and position)\n - A: x (not in the word)\n - I: x (not in the word)\n - S: x (not in the word)\n - E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\n So, we know:\n - The letter R is in the word and at the first position.\n - The letters A, I, S are not in the word at all.\n - The letter E is somewhere in the word, but not in the fifth position.\n\n We also have used 1 guess and have 5 tries left.\n\n The secret word:\n - Starts with R: so pattern is R _ _ _ _\n - Contains E (but not in the 5th position) and does not contain A, I, S.\n - Therefore, the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding A, I, S (and also excluding R and E that we know about, though E is in the word but elsewhere).\n\n Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Now, for the next guess:\n - We must form a valid 5-letter word starting with R (since the first position is confirmed).\n - We must include E in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4 (to help locate it) and avoid letters A, I, S.\n - We can also include other common letters to test for presence.\n\n Considering the constraints, let\'s choose a word that:\n   - Starts with R\n   - Has E in position 2, 3, or 4 (we\'ll try position 3 for example to see)\n   - Uses other letters we haven\'t ruled out, like N, T, L, O, U, etc.\n\n Example: ""REBEL"" is not good because E is in position 2 and 4, but we don\'t want redundant E? Also we know E is present once? Wait, the secret word might have multiple Es? The feedback only shows that at least one E exists.

No, RODEO does not have A? Actually, RODEO doesn\'t contain A, I, S? But wait: RODEO has O twice? And we don\'t know if doubles are allowed? But the secret word might have repeated letters? The feedback so far doesn\'t suggest that the word has doubles? Since we only have R and E as known letters.\n\n Let me think of words that start with R and include E (not fifth) and avoid A, I, S.\n\n Common options:\n   - ""ROUTE"": R then O, U, T, E -> E is in fifth, but we know E is not in fifth. So we must avoid fifth position for E? Exactly. We need E in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\n   - ""REACH"": but has A -> invalid because A is not present (as per feedback: A is x, meaning A is not in the word). So we must avoid A.\n\n   - Words without A, I, S: so letters to choose from: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n   - And we must include E (somewhere in positions 2-4).\n\n   Suggestions:\n      ""REBEL"": E is at positions 2 and 4? But we don\'t know if the word has two Es? And we don\'t know if we can get extra information? However, we don\'t have information for letters B and L.\n\n      ""RENEW"": E at 2 and 4? Same issue.\n\n      ""RETCH"": E in position 2, then T, C, H? That might work.\n\n      ""RENAL"": but N, A? Wait, A is excluded. ""RENAL"" has A? So no.\n\n      ""REVEL"": E at 2 and 4? Also V and L.\n\n How about ""ROTATE""? But has A? Not allowed.\n\n Wait, note: we know the word does not have A, I, S.\n\n Let me suggest: ""RINSE"" -> but I? We cannot use I because we know I is not present.\n\n Actually, we must avoid I as well.\n\n Another word: ""RESET"" -> but S? Feedback said S is not present. So we must avoid S? Exactly. So ""RESET"" is not allowed because it has S.\n\n What about ""REVEL""? Let\'s check: R, E, V, E, L? Doesn\'t have A, I, S? So it\'s okay? But we have E twice. But the secret word might only have one E? We don\'t know. But we can get feedback for E twice? However, if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E\'s will get a \'✓\' or \'-\' and the other will get an \'x\'? Actually, we\'ll see.\n\n But we have to get letters we haven\'t tested yet.\n\n Alternatively, to avoid multiple E\'s, we could choose a word with E in a new position and four new letters? But we have to use E because we know it\'s in the word somewhere (but not at the start and not at the end? Wait, start is R, so E is in the middle).\n\n Choice: ""ROBED"" -> R, O, B, E, D? E is in fourth position? And avoids A, I, S? Yes.\n\n But we could also try ""RULED"": R, U, L, E, D? Also avoids A, I, S? Yes.\n\n However, note: the feedback from the first guess: R is first, E is not fifth. So in ""RULED"", E is fifth? Wait no: positions: \n   R (pos1), U (pos2), L (pos3), E (pos4), D (pos5). But we know E cannot be in fifth? Actually, the feedback for ""raise"": E at fifth position was marked as \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not at the fifth. So that doesn\'t forbid E from being at fifth? Actually, let me recheck:\n\n In ""raise"", the E was in the fifth position. The feedback for E: \'-\' meaning present but wrong position? But wait, the fifth position of ""raise"" got \'-\', so the secret word does have E, but not at the fifth position? Actually, the feedback symbol for E was \'-\', which according to the rules: \n   - : the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.\n\n So for E, because we put it at the fifth, but the secret word has E somewhere else? Therefore, E is in the word but not at fifth. Therefore, if we guess ""RULED"", we put E at fourth? Which is not fifth? So that is allowed? But we don\'t know if the secret word has E at fourth? Actually, we don\'t? So if we put E at fourth, we might get:\n\n   If E is in the secret word at fourth: ✓\n   If E is in the secret word but not at fourth, then -.\n\n But we already are sure E is present? Yes.\n\n However, we are trying to find where E goes.\n\n Also note: we must avoid using letters A, I, S.\n\n So, let\'s try to form a word without any repeated letters? Because repeated letters might complicate feedback? But not forbidden.\n\n Actually, we should try to use distinct letters to maximize the information? So no repeated letters.\n\n Since E is the only letter we know is present (besides R), we can try:\n\n   R, and then four new distinct letters, plus E in one position 2, 3, or 4.\n\n But we don\'t want to use A, I, S. So we have lots of letters.\n\n Example: ""R"" + E in position 2? Then the letters for position 3,4,5 must be new? But we have to form a word.\n\n How about ""RETRY"": but R twice? and T and Y? Also, we know E? But then E is at position 2? Then positions 3 and 4: T, R? Wait, this word: \n   R E T R Y -> R at position 1 and 4? So double R? That might confuse? Also, the secret word may have only one R? We don\'t know? Feedback for R was ✓ at position 1? So if there is another R? Then we might see? But we don\'t have any prior indication.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s avoid repeated letters.\n\n Consider: ""ROUTE""? \n   - But E is at fifth? We know E is not at fifth? Because in the first guess, E was at fifth and got \'-\' meaning not at fifth? So if we guess E at fifth again? Then we are wasting? Because we already know E is not at fifth? Therefore, we must not put E at fifth in this next guess.\n\n So:\n\n    We have three positions for E: 2, 3, 4.\n\n Another word: ""REPEL""? But E at positions 2 and 4? So we get E twice? Also P and L? And avoids A,I,S.\n\n Alternatively, ""RECUT"": \n   R (position1), E (position2), C (position3), U (position4), T (position5). \n   This has E at position 2? And no E doubled? And avoids A,I,S? Yes.\n\n But we don\'t know about C, U, T.\n\n Another: ""REGAL""? But G and L? Also avoids A,I,S? Actually, REGAL: has A? Wait, REGAL -> R E G A L? Oh, A at position 4? But we cannot use A? Because we know A is not in the secret word? So REGAL is invalid? Because it uses A, which we know isn\'t present.\n\n How about ""REIGN""? But has I? Invalid.\n\n ""RELET"": R E L E T? Avoids A,I,S? But has E doubled? Also, E in positions 2 and 4? Actually, RELET? Is that a word? I think not? Maybe RENT etc.\n\n For the sake of time, let me choose ""ROMEO""? But has O twice? And O? Also, is M present? And E? Wait, ""ROMEO"": R O M E O? \n   - Starts with R? Yes.\n   - E is at position 4? That\'s valid (not fifth)? \n   - Avoids A, I, S? Yes? R, O, M, E, O? Actually, letters: R,O,M,E? And O repeated? But the word R O M E O? So is that valid? In dictionary? But the rules require valid English word? Romeo is a proper noun? Usually words should be common nouns or verbs? Let\'s assume it\'s allowed? Actually, Wordle usually allows common 5-letter words, including proper nouns? Or not? I don\'t recall.\n\n But also, the word has O repeated? We don\'t know if O appears twice? But that\'s acceptable? However, for maximizing information, repeated letters are inefficient.\n\n Another common word: ""ROBED"": \n   R (1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? \n   This avoids A, I, S? Yes.\n   E is at position 4? So we want to test if E is at 4? If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at 4. If we get \'-\', then E is not at 4 but in another position? That could be 2 or 3? But note we haven\'t tested position 5? But we know E is not at 5? So E must be at 2 or 3? So if we put at 4 and get \'-\', then E is at 2 or 3? Similarly, if we put E at 4 and get ✓, then we lock position 4.\n\n Also, we can test letters O, B, D? \n\n Alternatively, ""RULEE""? Not a word.\n\n I think ""ROBED"" is a reasonable choice? But let me check if it\'s a word? Yes, robed is an adjective meaning dressed? So acceptable.\n\n However, we already have R as first? Then R O B E D? Then the third position? We haven\'t tested? And we don\'t know if O, B, D are present.\n\n Another word: ""RECED""? No? ""RECEDE"" is 6 letters.\n\n How about ""REEDY""? But two E\'s? And Y? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? R E E D Y? So E in positions 2 and 3? Then D,Y? But we can get feedback on both E?\n\n Since we have limited guesses, why not focus on words that don\'t repeat letters? So I choose ""ROBED"".\n\n But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? But that\'s not known? But we are safe? For now, let\'s pick.\n\n Alternatively, ""RIPED""? Not a word.\n\n Or ""ROWED"": R O W E D? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? That\'s a word? ROWED: past tense of row? So acceptable.\n\n And letters: R, O, W, E, D? All distinct? Yes? And no repeated letters? Great.\n\n So with ""ROWED"":\n   - R at first (we know so will be ✓)\n   - O: new letter? If O is in the word? Then any position? We don\'t know?\n   - W: new\n   - E: in fourth position? Then we see what happens? \n   - D: new\n\n Also, we have E in fourth? So if E is in the word at fourth? We get ✓? Otherwise, we get \'-\'? And then we know E is at 2 or 3? So we can learn.\n\n But let\'s list:\n\n   Position1: R (must be ✓ always)\n   Position2: O -> we don\'t know? Could be anything? And similarly W at position3? Then E at position4? Then D at position5.\n\n So we get feedback for O, W, E, D? And W is not the best letter? But we can try.\n\n More common than W? How about ""ROTED""? Not a word? ""ROTED"" isn\'t a word? Or ""ROTATE"" is 6 letters? \n\n ""RENTED""? Avoids A, I, S? Wait: R E N T E D? Has E twice and T? Also, E appears? But we have E at position2 and same condition? Also, length? 6 letters? Oh, RENTED is 6? \n\n Actually, ""RENT""? Only 4 letters? \n\n So ""ROWED"" or ""ROBED""? Or ""RULED""? ""RULED"": R U L E D? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? And distinct letters.\n\n ""RULED"": R (1), U(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)? \n   - E is at position4? We want to check E\'s position? Similar to ROBED? But with U,L instead of O,B? \n\n Which one? Since we want common letters? Maybe RULED or ROBED? Both are common? \n\n But note: the secret word might include one of these letters? We don\'t know? \n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that also tests common consonants: let\'s pick a word with T? Because T is very common? \n\n How about ""RETCH"": \n   R (1), E(2), T(3), C(4), H(5)? \n   - This has E in position2? Which is a valid position? And avoids A,I,S? Yes? \n   - Letters: R, E, T, C, H? Distinct? Yes.\n\n And T is very common.\n\n So ""RETCH"" might be better? \n\n Also, if E is at position2? We get:\n   If ✓, then we know E is position2? \n   If - , then E is either position3 or 4? Because we know E is not in position5?\n\n So then we can lock position1 and position2? \n\n Let me decide: ""RETCH"" is a valid word? Yes? Meaning to make a sharp cough sound? \n\n So let\'s go with ""RETCH""?\n\n Summary of reasons for ""RETCH"":\n   - Starts with R? ✔\n   - Places E in position2 to test? \n   - Includes common consonants T, C, H? \n   - Avoids A, I, S? Yes.\n\n Thus, next guess: ""RETCH""\n\n<guess>retch</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""raise"":\n- **R** is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- **A**, **I**, and **S** are not in the word (x).\n- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word starts with **R** (position 1).\n- **E** is present but not in positions 1 or 5, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n- **A**, **I**, and **S** are eliminated—avoid using these letters.\n- The word contains at least **R** and **E**, with **E** misplaced.\n\nFor the next guess, prioritize:\n- Starting with **R** to maintain position 1 certainty.\n- Placing **E** in position 2, 3, or 4 to pinpoint its location (e.g., position 2).\n- Testing new common consonants (""T"", ""C"", ""H"") to gather more information.\n- Avoiding invalid letters: **A**, **I**, **S**.\n\n**RETCH** fits perfectly:\n- Valid English word (meaning to vomit or make a sharp sound).\n- Starts with **R** (position 1).\n- Places **E** in position 2 (tests if **E** is in position 2).\n- Introduces new letters (**T**, **C**, **H**)—allowing feedback on their presence/position.\n- No **A**, **I**, or **S**, adhering to constraints.\n\n<guess>retch</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: retch -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) T(x) C(x) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two pieces of feedback:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""raise""):\n- R ✓ (position 1 correct)\n- A x (not in word)\n- I x (not in word)\n- S x (not in word)\n- E - (in word, but not position 5)\n\nFrom Guess 2 (""retch""):\n- R ✓ (position 1 correct, as expected)\n- E ✓ (position 2 correct! So E is now confirmed at position 2)\n- T x (T not in word)\n- C x (C not in word)\n- H x (H not in word)\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The secret word starts with ""RE"" (positions 1 and 2 are R and E).\n- We\'ve eliminated A, I, S, T, C, H as possible letters.\n- The word does not contain these letters: A, I, S, T, C, H.\n- The remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding these: A, I, S, T, C, H (and including E, but it\'s already placed).\n\nThe secret word pattern: ""R E _ _ _""\nPositions 3, 4, and 5 need to be filled with letters that are not A,I,S,T,C,H.\n\nWe also know from Guess 1 that E is in the word but not position 5. However, we now know E is at position 2, so that condition is satisfied.\n\nWe must form a 5-letter word in the pattern ""RE___"" that doesn\'t use A,I,S,T,C,H.\n\nAdditionally, we have unused letters to test. Common consonants like N, O, U, L, D, etc.\n\nThe word must be valid English.\n\nTo maximize information, we should test common letters in positions 3, 4, and 5.\n\nWe have 5 tries left? Wait: two guesses used, so 4 tries left? But originally 6, so after guess 2, we have 4 guesses left? But let\'s proceed.\n\nWe know the word starts with ""RE"". We need to guess the last three letters.\n\nWe also have eliminated several letters? So remaining letters: B,D,F,G,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and E? But E is fixed at position 2).\n\nBut E is already used? So for the remaining positions? Not? Actually, the secret word might contain repeated letters? So E could appear again? We don\'t know? But we have no reason to forbid doubles? However, we haven\'t seen doubles? But possible.\n\nBut the known letters: R and E? So if we put another E? Then in feedback we might see? For now? We can avoid? For simplicity? Or not? It\'s okay? Because we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s see: with pattern ""RE___"", we can form words.\n\nWe should choose a word that uses common letters we haven\'t tested? For example, we haven\'t tested N, L, D? etc.\n\nCommon suffixes for words that start with ""RE"": examples: ""RELAY"", but L? Then A? But A is eliminated? So ""RELAY"" invalid.\n\n""REBEL"": E doubled? But it has B,E,L? Avoids A,I,S,T,C,H? Yes: B, E, L? Wait B, E, L? And pattern? ""REB E L""? Wait: R E B E L? Actually, ""REBEL"" has E in position 4? And E? So if we try ""REBEL"", we would have:\n  Position: 1 R (✓), 2 E (✓), 3 B (testing), 4 E (testing for duplicate?), 5 L (testing?).\n\nIf the word has B? Then? Etc.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with distinct new letters? So we avoid re-testing E? Since we already know E is in the word? And we don\'t know if it\'s duplicated? But we can get information? However, to maximize? Testing three new letters might be better.\n\nTherefore, let\'s try a word without repeated letters? And avoid E? Or only one E? We already have E at position 2? We don\'t need to put E again? Unless we suspect duplication? But we have no evidence? So perhaps avoid duplicates.\n\nWord: ""REbut""? Not five? Wait 5 letters?\n\n""REBAR""? But A? A is invalid? No.\n\n""REVEL"": V and L? Avoids A,I,S,T,C,H? Yes: V, E, L? But double E? Wait, ""REVEL""? Letters: R,E,V,E,L? So has E twice? Actually? It has E at position 2 and 4? So we are reusing E? But we know E? So possibly redundant? But V and L are new? So maybe.\n\nBut we get feedback on V and L? If we put E at position 4? And if the secret word has E? Then we might get ✓ for E? Or if duplicate? Then ✓ for E4? But if no duplicate? Then we get \'-\'? Or if E is only at 2? Then position 4 E would be wrong position? But we know E only at 2? Actually, we know it is in the word? But perhaps only at 2? So E at 4 might be extra? Then feedback for position 4? If E is not at 4 but E is in word? Then \'-\' for E? Because wrong position? But E is correctly placed? No? Not? Position 4? We don\'t know? So it can be \'-?\'.\n\nActually, the secret word might not have E at 4? Then feedback would mark E with \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word? But we already know E is in the word? So if we put E at 4, and if it\'s not present? Then it would be \'x\'? So we can tell if E is duplicated? Or not.\n\nBut to avoid confusion? And save guesses? Use distinct letters.\n\nLet me suggest ""REMOD""? Not a word? ""REMODEL"" too long? \n\n""REMOW""? Not word.\n\n""REMUT""? Not word.\n\nCommon words: ""REIGN""? But I? I eliminated? We cannot use I? Since I is not present? And I is in ""REIGN""? So invalid.\n\n""REPAY""? But P and A? Then A? A is invalid? So no.\n\n""REPLY"": L and Y? Avoids A,I,S,T,C,H? Yes? Pattern: R E P L Y? Letters: R,E,P,L,Y? All distinct? No duplicates? And avoids forbidden letters? E included? But in the pattern? We are forced at positions 1 and 2? Then in ""REPLY"": position 3 P, position 4 L, position 5 Y? Perfect? \n\nAlso ""REPLY"" is a common English word? Yes? Meaning to respond.\n\nSo with ""REPLY"", we can get feedback for:\n  Position1: R (already ✓)\n  Position2: E (already ✓)\n  Position3: P? Is P in word? If yes? Where?\n  Position4: L? Same?\n  Position5: Y? Same?\n\nTherefore, our guess: ""REPLY""\n\n<guess>reply</guess>Based on previous feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1 (raise)**: R is correct and in position 1 (✓), A/I/S are absent (x), E is present but not in position 5 (-).  \n- **Guess 2 (retch)**: R and E are correct and in positions 1 and 2 (✓), T/C/H are absent (x).  \n\nKey deductions:  \n- The secret word starts with **""RE""** (positions 1 and 2 confirmed).  \n- Eliminated letters: **A, I, S, T, C, H** (cannot appear anywhere).  \n- The word pattern is **""RE___""**, with positions 3–5 unknown.  \n- E is confirmed at position 2; positions 3–5 must use new letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding A,I,S,T,C,H).  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Must start with ""RE"" and adhere to the pattern ""RE___"".  \n- Prioritize testing common letters not yet tried (e.g., L, N, P, D, Y) to gather maximum information.  \n- ""REPLY"" fits perfectly:  \n  - Valid English word (meaning to respond).  \n  - Avoids eliminated letters (A,I,S,T,C,H).  \n  - Tests new letters: **P** (position 3), **L** (position 4), **Y** (position 5).  \n- Feedback will reveal whether P, L, or Y are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>reply</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: retch -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) T(x) C(x) H(x)\nGuess 3: reply -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) P(x) L(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R(✓) : R is correct and in position 1.
- A(x) : A is not in the word.
- I(x) : I is not in the word.
- S(x) : S is not in the word.
- E(-) : E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""retch""
- R(✓) : R is correct and in position 1 (as expected).
- E(✓) : E is correct and in position 2 (so now we know positions 1 and 2 are R and E).
- T(x) : T is not in the word.
- C(x) : C is not in the word.
- H(x) : H is not in the word.

Guess 3: ""reply""
- R(✓) : R correct in position 1.
- E(✓) : E correct in position 2.
- P(x) : P is not in the word.
- L(x) : L is not in the word.
- Y(✓) : Y is correct and in position 5.

So now we know:
- The word starts with ""RE"" and ends with ""Y"", so the pattern is ""RE _ _ Y"".
- We have eliminated the following letters: A, I, S, T, C, H, P, L (all marked with x).
- The only letters we know are in the word: R, E, and Y (with R at 1, E at 2, Y at 5).
- We need to find the two middle letters (positions 3 and 4) from the remaining letters.

The secret word: R E ? ? Y

Eliminated letters: A, I, S, T, C, H, P, L.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (Note: E is already used, but we don't know if it can be repeated? However, we have no evidence of repetition so far, but it's possible. But since we have two positions to fill, we should consider the possibility.)

But note: in the first guess, E was marked as present but not at position 5, and now we have E at position 2. There could be another E? But we don't have any indication. However, we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any feedback suggesting duplicates? So we can assume no duplicates for now? But we should be cautious.

We have two positions: 3 and 4.

We need to form a valid English word that starts with ""RE"", ends with ""Y"", and has two letters in the middle from the remaining set, avoiding the eliminated letters.

Common words that fit the pattern ""RE _ _ Y"":
- ""READY"": but A is eliminated? A is not allowed? And D? But A is x? So no.
- ""REALY"": but A and L? L is eliminated? And also, ""REALY"" is not a common word? Actually, ""RELAY"" is a word? But L is eliminated? And A? Both are out.
- ""REBUS"": but S is eliminated? And U? But S is x? So no.
- ""RECKY"": but C is eliminated? And K? C is x? So no.
- ""REDDY"": has D? But also double D? And Y? But ""REDDY"" is a word? Meaning ready? But let's check: R E D D Y? So positions: 3 and 4 are D and D? But we have eliminated D? Actually, we haven't eliminated D? D is not in the eliminated list? Eliminated: A,I,S,T,C,H,P,L. So D is available? But we have two D's? So we need to consider if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven't seen any? However, we can try? But we are going to guess? We have to form a word.

But we don't know if D is in the word? We haven't tested D? So we can use D? Similarly, other letters.

Possible words:
- ""REDDY"": R E D D Y? But two D's? And we don't know if D is in the word? But we can test? However, we are limited to 4 guesses? We have 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3, so 3 left? But we can try.

But let's list possible words without duplicates first? Because duplicates might be less common? Or not? We don't know.

Words with distinct letters for positions 3 and 4? And ending with Y? And avoiding eliminated letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common words:
- ""RENEW"": but E? We already have E? And W? But ""RENEW"" has E at position 3? But we don't know if E is duplicated? And also, it ends with W? Not Y? So no? We need to end with Y.
- ""REBUY"": B and U? Avoids eliminated? Yes? R E B U Y? So positions: 3:B, 4:U? Then Y? So ""REBUY"" is a word? Meaning to buy again? Yes? Valid.
- ""REFER"": but ends with R? Not Y? And has E? Duplicate? So no.
- ""REIFY"": but I? I is eliminated? So no.
- ""RELAY"": but L and A? Both eliminated? No.
- ""REMAN"": but ends with N? Not Y? And A? Eliminated? No.
- ""REMIT"": T eliminated? No.
- ""RENAY"": but A? Eliminated? No.
- ""REPOT"": P and T? Both eliminated? No.
- ""RERUN"": R? Duplicate? And ends with N? Not Y? No.
- ""RESAY"": S and A? Eliminated? No.
- ""RESEW"": S? Eliminated? No.
- ""RETRY"": T? Eliminated? No.
- ""REUSE"": S? Eliminated? No.
- ""REVEL"": L? Eliminated? No.

So ""REBUY"" is a candidate? But we have to check if it uses only available letters? Yes: B, U? Both are available? And Y is already at the end? So ""REBUY"" is R E B U Y.

But we don't know if B and U are in the word? We are testing them? So we can get feedback.

Another candidate: ""REJIG""? But ends with G? Not Y? No.

""REJOY""? Not a word? 

""REKEY"": K and E? But E is already at position 2? So if we put E at position 4? Then we have two E's? But we don't know? ""REKEY"" is a word? Meaning to enter data again? Yes? But it has E at position 4? So R E K E Y? So positions: 3:K, 4:E? Then Y? But we have E at position 2 and 4? So duplicate E? And K? 

But we have eliminated K? No? K is available? So we can try? But we are testing for E duplication? 

But we have a candidate without duplication: ""REBUY"" (R E B U Y) with distinct letters? Yes? B and U are distinct? And not used before? 

Another candidate: ""REWAX"": W and A? A is eliminated? So no.

""REBOX"": O and X? But ends with X? Not Y? No.

""REBUY"" seems good? But let's see if there are others.

""REDUX"": D and U? But ends with X? Not Y? So no.

""REDYE"": D and Y? But Y is already at the end? And E? Duplicate? ""REDYE"" is R E D Y E? But we need to end with Y? So pattern? R E D Y E? That's 5 letters? But then position 5 is E? But we know Y is at position 5? So it must end with Y? So ""REDYE"" would have Y at position 4? And E at 5? But we know Y is at 5? So that doesn't match? We need the word to end with Y? So position 5 must be Y? So ""REDYE"" is not valid? Because it ends with E? 

We need the pattern: R E ? ? Y

So the fourth letter must be the one before Y? So position 4 is the fourth letter? Then position 5 is Y? So the word must be of the form: R E X Z Y, where X and Z are the letters for positions 3 and 4.

So ""REBUY"": positions: 3:B, 4:U, 5:Y? So that fits? 

Another word: ""REGUR"": but ends with R? Not Y? No.

""REJOG"": ends with G? No.

""REKEY"": as above? R E K E Y? But then position 4 is E? So we have E at 2 and 4? And position 3 is K? Then Y? So that also fits the pattern? But has duplicate E? 

But we don't know if duplicate E is allowed? So both are possible? 

But we have ""REBUY"" without duplicate? So let's prefer that? 

Another word: ""REMAP"": P? Eliminated? No? P is eliminated? From guess 3: P(x)? So we cannot use P? 

Similarly, L is eliminated? 

What about ""REWON""? Ends with N? No.

""REZONE"": O and N? But ends with E? Not Y? No.

""REVIEW"": I? Eliminated? And E? Duplicate? But I is not allowed? 

""REBUY"" and ""REKEY"" are two options? 

But ""REKEY"" has E at position 4? So if we guess ""REKEY"", we might get:

- Position 1: R ✓
- Position 2: E ✓
- Position 3: K? If K is in the word? But we don't know? 
- Position 4: E? If E is duplicated? Then ✓? Or if not? Then x? Or -? 
  - If the secret word has only one E (at position 2), then E at position 4 would be wrong? So it would be marked as x? Because not in the word? Or if it is in the word but wrong position? But if the word has only one E and it's at position 2, then E at 4 is not present? So x? 
  - But if the word has two E's? Then E at 4 might be ✓? Or if E is at another position? But we only have positions 3 and 4? And we know position 5 is Y? So if E is at position 3? Then E at 4 would be wrong? But we have E at 2? So if E is at 3? Then we have two E's? 

This is getting complicated? 

Alternatively, ""REBUY"" tests two new letters: B and U? Without duplication? So we get clear feedback? 

But we have to see if there are other words? 

Another word: ""REPAY""? But P and A? Both eliminated? No.

""REFRY"": F and R? But R is already used? And ends with Y? R E F R Y? So duplicate R? And F? 

But R is at position 1? So if we put R at position 4? Then we might get feedback? But we know R is in the word? But we don't know if duplicated? 

""REFRY"" is a word? Meaning to fry again? Yes? 

But we have eliminated F? No? F is available? 

So ""REFRY"": R E F R Y? Positions: 3:F, 4:R? Then Y? 

But we have R at position 1 and 4? So duplicate R? 

Similarly, we can consider? 

But let's list all possible words? We don't have time? 

Given the constraints, the possible words I can think of are:
- ""REBUY"" (R E B U Y)
- ""REKEY"" (R E K E Y)
- ""REFRY"" (R E F R Y)
- ""REDDY"" (R E D D Y) - with duplicate D

But ""REDDY"" has duplicate D? And we don't know if D is in the word? 

We need to choose one? 

Since we have Y at the end? And ""RE"" at the beginning? 

Another word: ""REBBY""? Not a word? 

""REJGY""? No.

""REMGY""? No.

""REVVY""? Not a word? 

""REWBY""? No.

So the common ones are ""REBUY"", ""REKEY"", ""REFRY"", and ""REDDY"". 

But ""REDDY"" might be considered a proper noun? But let's assume it's allowed? 

To maximize information? We should avoid duplicates? So ""REBUY"" is better? Because it tests two new letters? 

If we guess ""REBUY"", we get:
  Position 3: B? If present? Then ✓ or -? But since we are putting at 3? If it's in the word? Then if at 3? ✓? Else -? 
  Position 4: U? Similarly? 

But if we get both x? Then we know B and U are not in the word? Then we can try other letters? 

Similarly, if we get one of them? Then we know? 

But we have only two positions? So we might solve it? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters? For example, D? D is common? 

But in ""REBUY"", B and U? U is a vowel? Not as common? 

""REEDY"": but E? Duplicate? And D? But ""REEDY"" is R E E D Y? So positions: 3:E, 4:D? Then Y? But we have E at 2 and 3? So duplicate E? And D? But we need to end with Y? So position 5 is Y? So ""REEDY"" is R E E D Y? So position 3 is E? Position 4 is D? 

But we don't know if E is duplicated? 

But we have ""REEDY"" as a candidate? 

But we have to avoid? Because we have eliminated? No? 

But let's see: ""REEDY"" uses E and D? E is known? D is new? 

But we are testing position 3 and 4? 

But we have multiple candidates? 

Given the feedback, we know Y is at the end? So the word is ""RE _ _ Y"". 

We have to guess? 

But we have 3 guesses left? So we can try? 

I think ""REBUY"" is a reasonable guess? 

But let's see the feedback from guess 3: Y is at position 5? So we are sure? 

So I'll go with ""REBUY"". 

But wait? Is there a word ""REBUS""? But S is eliminated? So no? 

Another word: ""REBEL""? But L? Eliminated? And E? Duplicate? 

""REBAR""? A? Eliminated? 

So ""REBUY"" it is? 

But let's confirm: ""REBUY"" is a valid word? Yes? 

So guess: ""REBUY""

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  
  - R(✓): Correct letter in position 1.  
  - A(x), I(x), S(x): A, I, S are **not** in the word.  
  - E(-): E is in the word but **not** in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""retch""**  
  - R(✓): Correct letter in position 1 (confirmed).  
  - E(✓): Correct letter in position 2 (new confirmation).  
  - T(x), C(x), H(x): T, C, H are **not** in the word.  

- **Guess 3: ""reply""**  
  - R(✓): Correct letter in position 1 (redundant).  
  - E(✓): Correct letter in position 2 (redundant).  
  - P(x), L(x): P and L are **not** in the word.  
  - Y(✓): Correct letter in position 5 (new confirmation).  

### Key Deductions
1. **Confirmed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **R**  
   - Position 2: **E**  
   - Position 5: **Y**  
   - The word pattern is **R E _ _ Y**.  

2. **Eliminated letters**:  
   - A, I, S, T, C, H, P, L (cannot appear anywhere).  

3. **Remaining unknown**:  
   - Positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters **not** eliminated.  
   - Valid letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
   - No duplicates confirmed yet, but possible (e.g., double E or other letters).  

4. **Possible words**:  
   - Must be a valid English word matching **R E _ _ Y**.  
   - Common options:  
     - **REBUY** (meaning: to buy again) → Tests B (pos 3) and U (pos 4).  
     - **REKEY** (meaning: to reprogram a key) → Tests K (pos 3) and E (pos 4; tests for E duplication).  
     - **REFRY** (meaning: to fry again) → Tests F (pos 3) and R (pos 4; tests for R duplication).  
   - **REBUY** is prioritized:  
     - Uses distinct new letters (B and U) to maximize information.  
     - Avoids duplicates, simplifying feedback.  
     - Common and valid 5-letter word.  

### Next Guess: ""REBUY""
- Tests **B** in position 3 and **U** in position 4.  
- If B or U are correct, feedback will reveal their positions/absence.  
- If both are absent, we eliminate B/U and narrow options further.  

<guess>rebuy</guess>",rebuy,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R(✓) : R is correct and in position 1.
- A(x) : A is not in the word.
- I(x) : I is not in the word.
- S(x) : S is not in the word.
- E(-) : E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""retch""
- R(✓) : R is correct and in position 1 (as expected).
- E(✓) : E is correct and in position 2 (so now we know positions 1 and 2 are R and E).
- T(x) : T is not in the word.
- C(x) : C is not in the word.
- H(x) : H is not in the word.

Guess 3: ""reply""
- R(✓) : R correct in position 1.
- E(✓) : E correct in position 2.
- P(x) : P is not in the word.
- L(x) : L is not in the word.
- Y(✓) : Y is correct and in position 5.

So now we know:
- The word starts with ""RE"" and ends with ""Y"", so the pattern is ""RE _ _ Y"".
- We have eliminated the following letters: A, I, S, T, C, H, P, L (all marked with x).
- The only letters we know are in the word: R, E, and Y (with R at 1, E at 2, Y at 5).
- We need to find the two middle letters (positions 3 and 4) from the remaining letters.

The secret word: R E ? ? Y

Eliminated letters: A, I, S, T, C, H, P, L.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (Note: E is already used, but we don't know if it can be repeated? However, we have no evidence of repetition so far, but it's possible. But since we have two positions to fill, we should consider the possibility.)

But note: in the first guess, E was marked as present but not at position 5, and now we have E at position 2. There could be another E? But we don't have any indication. However, we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any feedback suggesting duplicates? So we can assume no duplicates for now? But we should be cautious.

We have two positions: 3 and 4.

We need to form a valid English word that starts with ""RE"", ends with ""Y"", and has two letters in the middle from the remaining set, avoiding the eliminated letters.

Common words that fit the pattern ""RE _ _ Y"":
- ""READY"": but A is eliminated? A is not allowed? And D? But A is x? So no.
- ""REALY"": but A and L? L is eliminated? And also, ""REALY"" is not a common word? Actually, ""RELAY"" is a word? But L is eliminated? And A? Both are out.
- ""REBUS"": but S is eliminated? And U? But S is x? So no.
- ""RECKY"": but C is eliminated? And K? C is x? So no.
- ""REDDY"": has D? But also double D? And Y? But ""REDDY"" is a word? Meaning ready? But let's check: R E D D Y? So positions: 3 and 4 are D and D? But we have eliminated D? Actually, we haven't eliminated D? D is not in the eliminated list? Eliminated: A,I,S,T,C,H,P,L. So D is available? But we have two D's? So we need to consider if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven't seen any? However, we can try? But we are going to guess? We have to form a word.

But we don't know if D is in the word? We haven't tested D? So we can use D? Similarly, other letters.

Possible words:
- ""REDDY"": R E D D Y? But two D's? And we don't know if D is in the word? But we can test? However, we are limited to 4 guesses? We have 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3, so 3 left? But we can try.

But let's list possible words without duplicates first? Because duplicates might be less common? Or not? We don't know.

Words with distinct letters for positions 3 and 4? And ending with Y? And avoiding eliminated letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common words:
- ""RENEW"": but E? We already have E? And W? But ""RENEW"" has E at position 3? But we don't know if E is duplicated? And also, it ends with W? Not Y? So no? We need to end with Y.
- ""REBUY"": B and U? Avoids eliminated? Yes? R E B U Y? So positions: 3:B, 4:U? Then Y? So ""REBUY"" is a word? Meaning to buy again? Yes? Valid.
- ""REFER"": but ends with R? Not Y? And has E? Duplicate? So no.
- ""REIFY"": but I? I is eliminated? So no.
- ""RELAY"": but L and A? Both eliminated? No.
- ""REMAN"": but ends with N? Not Y? And A? Eliminated? No.
- ""REMIT"": T eliminated? No.
- ""RENAY"": but A? Eliminated? No.
- ""REPOT"": P and T? Both eliminated? No.
- ""RERUN"": R? Duplicate? And ends with N? Not Y? No.
- ""RESAY"": S and A? Eliminated? No.
- ""RESEW"": S? Eliminated? No.
- ""RETRY"": T? Eliminated? No.
- ""REUSE"": S? Eliminated? No.
- ""REVEL"": L? Eliminated? No.

So ""REBUY"" is a candidate? But we have to check if it uses only available letters? Yes: B, U? Both are available? And Y is already at the end? So ""REBUY"" is R E B U Y.

But we don't know if B and U are in the word? We are testing them? So we can get feedback.

Another candidate: ""REJIG""? But ends with G? Not Y? No.

""REJOY""? Not a word? 

""REKEY"": K and E? But E is already at position 2? So if we put E at position 4? Then we have two E's? But we don't know? ""REKEY"" is a word? Meaning to enter data again? Yes? But it has E at position 4? So R E K E Y? So positions: 3:K, 4:E? Then Y? But we have E at position 2 and 4? So duplicate E? And K? 

But we have eliminated K? No? K is available? So we can try? But we are testing for E duplication? 

But we have a candidate without duplication: ""REBUY"" (R E B U Y) with distinct letters? Yes? B and U are distinct? And not used before? 

Another candidate: ""REWAX"": W and A? A is eliminated? So no.

""REBOX"": O and X? But ends with X? Not Y? No.

""REBUY"" seems good? But let's see if there are others.

""REDUX"": D and U? But ends with X? Not Y? So no.

""REDYE"": D and Y? But Y is already at the end? And E? Duplicate? ""REDYE"" is R E D Y E? But we need to end with Y? So pattern? R E D Y E? That's 5 letters? But then position 5 is E? But we know Y is at position 5? So it must end with Y? So ""REDYE"" would have Y at position 4? And E at 5? But we know Y is at 5? So that doesn't match? We need the word to end with Y? So position 5 must be Y? So ""REDYE"" is not valid? Because it ends with E? 

We need the pattern: R E ? ? Y

So the fourth letter must be the one before Y? So position 4 is the fourth letter? Then position 5 is Y? So the word must be of the form: R E X Z Y, where X and Z are the letters for positions 3 and 4.

So ""REBUY"": positions: 3:B, 4:U, 5:Y? So that fits? 

Another word: ""REGUR"": but ends with R? Not Y? No.

""REJOG"": ends with G? No.

""REKEY"": as above? R E K E Y? But then position 4 is E? So we have E at 2 and 4? And position 3 is K? Then Y? So that also fits the pattern? But has duplicate E? 

But we don't know if duplicate E is allowed? So both are possible? 

But we have ""REBUY"" without duplicate? So let's prefer that? 

Another word: ""REMAP"": P? Eliminated? No? P is eliminated? From guess 3: P(x)? So we cannot use P? 

Similarly, L is eliminated? 

What about ""REWON""? Ends with N? No.

""REZONE"": O and N? But ends with E? Not Y? No.

""REVIEW"": I? Eliminated? And E? Duplicate? But I is not allowed? 

""REBUY"" and ""REKEY"" are two options? 

But ""REKEY"" has E at position 4? So if we guess ""REKEY"", we might get:

- Position 1: R ✓
- Position 2: E ✓
- Position 3: K? If K is in the word? But we don't know? 
- Position 4: E? If E is duplicated? Then ✓? Or if not? Then x? Or -? 
  - If the secret word has only one E (at position 2), then E at position 4 would be wrong? So it would be marked as x? Because not in the word? Or if it is in the word but wrong position? But if the word has only one E and it's at position 2, then E at 4 is not present? So x? 
  - But if the word has two E's? Then E at 4 might be ✓? Or if E is at another position? But we only have positions 3 and 4? And we know position 5 is Y? So if E is at position 3? Then E at 4 would be wrong? But we have E at 2? So if E is at 3? Then we have two E's? 

This is getting complicated? 

Alternatively, ""REBUY"" tests two new letters: B and U? Without duplication? So we get clear feedback? 

But we have to see if there are other words? 

Another word: ""REPAY""? But P and A? Both eliminated? No.

""REFRY"": F and R? But R is already used? And ends with Y? R E F R Y? So duplicate R? And F? 

But R is at position 1? So if we put R at position 4? Then we might get feedback? But we know R is in the word? But we don't know if duplicated? 

""REFRY"" is a word? Meaning to fry again? Yes? 

But we have eliminated F? No? F is available? 

So ""REFRY"": R E F R Y? Positions: 3:F, 4:R? Then Y? 

But we have R at position 1 and 4? So duplicate R? 

Similarly, we can consider? 

But let's list all possible words? We don't have time? 

Given the constraints, the possible words I can think of are:
- ""REBUY"" (R E B U Y)
- ""REKEY"" (R E K E Y)
- ""REFRY"" (R E F R Y)
- ""REDDY"" (R E D D Y) - with duplicate D

But ""REDDY"" has duplicate D? And we don't know if D is in the word? 

We need to choose one? 

Since we have Y at the end? And ""RE"" at the beginning? 

Another word: ""REBBY""? Not a word? 

""REJGY""? No.

""REMGY""? No.

""REVVY""? Not a word? 

""REWBY""? No.

So the common ones are ""REBUY"", ""REKEY"", ""REFRY"", and ""REDDY"". 

But ""REDDY"" might be considered a proper noun? But let's assume it's allowed? 

To maximize information? We should avoid duplicates? So ""REBUY"" is better? Because it tests two new letters? 

If we guess ""REBUY"", we get:
  Position 3: B? If present? Then ✓ or -? But since we are putting at 3? If it's in the word? Then if at 3? ✓? Else -? 
  Position 4: U? Similarly? 

But if we get both x? Then we know B and U are not in the word? Then we can try other letters? 

Similarly, if we get one of them? Then we know? 

But we have only two positions? So we might solve it? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters? For example, D? D is common? 

But in ""REBUY"", B and U? U is a vowel? Not as common? 

""REEDY"": but E? Duplicate? And D? But ""REEDY"" is R E E D Y? So positions: 3:E, 4:D? Then Y? But we have E at 2 and 3? So duplicate E? And D? But we need to end with Y? So position 5 is Y? So ""REEDY"" is R E E D Y? So position 3 is E? Position 4 is D? 

But we don't know if E is duplicated? 

But we have ""REEDY"" as a candidate? 

But we have to avoid? Because we have eliminated? No? 

But let's see: ""REEDY"" uses E and D? E is known? D is new? 

But we are testing position 3 and 4? 

But we have multiple candidates? 

Given the feedback, we know Y is at the end? So the word is ""RE _ _ Y"". 

We have to guess? 

But we have 3 guesses left? So we can try? 

I think ""REBUY"" is a reasonable guess? 

But let's see the feedback from guess 3: Y is at position 5? So we are sure? 

So I'll go with ""REBUY"". 

But wait? Is there a word ""REBUS""? But S is eliminated? So no? 

Another word: ""REBEL""? But L? Eliminated? And E? Duplicate? 

""REBAR""? A? Eliminated? 

So ""REBUY"" it is? 

But let's confirm: ""REBUY"" is a valid word? Yes? 

So guess: ""REBUY""

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,reedy,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>
For my first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that maximizes information gain. Since I have no prior feedback, I should select a word with common letters and no repeats to cover a broad range of possibilities. Common vowels like A, E, I and consonants like R, S are good choices. A word like ""RAISE"" is ideal because:
- It contains R, A, I, S, E—all high-frequency letters in English.
- Each letter is unique, so feedback on each position will be clear.
- This word is a valid English word, so it adheres to the rules.

After this guess, the feedback will help me identify correct letters and positions for subsequent guesses.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"":
 - R: ✓ (correct letter and position)
 - A: x (not in the word)
 - I: x (not in the word)
 - S: x (not in the word)
 - E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter R is in the word and at the first position.
 - The letters A, I, S are not in the word at all.
 - The letter E is somewhere in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 We also have used 1 guess and have 5 tries left.

 The secret word:
 - Starts with R: so pattern is R _ _ _ _
 - Contains E (but not in the 5th position) and does not contain A, I, S.
 - Therefore, the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding A, I, S (and also excluding R and E that we know about, though E is in the word but elsewhere).

 Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

 Now, for the next guess:
 - We must form a valid 5-letter word starting with R (since the first position is confirmed).
 - We must include E in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4 (to help locate it) and avoid letters A, I, S.
 - We can also include other common letters to test for presence.

 Considering the constraints, let's choose a word that:
   - Starts with R
   - Has E in position 2, 3, or 4 (we'll try position 3 for example to see)
   - Uses other letters we haven't ruled out, like N, T, L, O, U, etc.

 Example: ""REBEL"" is not good because E is in position 2 and 4, but we don't want redundant E? Also we know E is present once? Wait, the secret word might have multiple Es? The feedback only shows that at least one E exists. But in ""raise"" we have one E and the feedback says E is present but not in the fifth position. However, we don't know if there are multiple Es.

 But note: the word must not contain A, I, S.

 However, ""REBEL"" contains E twice and we don't know if the word has two Es. Also, it uses B and L? But we don't know about them.

 Alternatively, let's try ""RECUT"": but does it have E? It has E in position 2, but then C and U and T? However, we might avoid uncommon letters? 

 Actually, we should choose a word that maximizes new information and uses common letters.

 Another idea: ""RODEO"" but contains O twice? And has A? No, RODEO does not have A? Actually, RODEO doesn't contain A, I, S? But wait: RODEO has O twice? And we don't know if doubles are allowed? But the secret word might have repeated letters? The feedback so far doesn't suggest that the word has doubles? Since we only have R and E as known letters.

 Let me think of words that start with R and include E (not fifth) and avoid A, I, S.

 Common options:
   - ""ROUTE"": R then O, U, T, E -> E is in fifth, but we know E is not in fifth. So we must avoid fifth position for E? Exactly. We need E in position 2, 3, or 4.

   - ""REACH"": but has A -> invalid because A is not present (as per feedback: A is x, meaning A is not in the word). So we must avoid A.

   - Words without A, I, S: so letters to choose from: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   - And we must include E (somewhere in positions 2-4).

   Suggestions:
      ""REBEL"": E is at positions 2 and 4? But we don't know if the word has two Es? And we don't know if we can get extra information? However, we don't have information for letters B and L.

      ""RENEW"": E at 2 and 4? Same issue.

      ""RETCH"": E in position 2, then T, C, H? That might work.

      ""RENAL"": but N, A? Wait, A is excluded. ""RENAL"" has A? So no.

      ""REVEL"": E at 2 and 4? Also V and L.

 How about ""ROTATE""? But has A? Not allowed.

 Wait, note: we know the word does not have A, I, S.

 Let me suggest: ""RINSE"" -> but I? We cannot use I because we know I is not present.

 Actually, we must avoid I as well.

 Another word: ""RESET"" -> but S? Feedback said S is not present. So we must avoid S? Exactly. So ""RESET"" is not allowed because it has S.

 What about ""REVEL""? Let's check: R, E, V, E, L? Doesn't have A, I, S? So it's okay? But we have E twice. But the secret word might only have one E? We don't know. But we can get feedback for E twice? However, if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E's will get a '✓' or '-' and the other will get an 'x'? Actually, we'll see.

 But we have to get letters we haven't tested yet.

 Alternatively, to avoid multiple E's, we could choose a word with E in a new position and four new letters? But we have to use E because we know it's in the word somewhere (but not at the start and not at the end? Wait, start is R, so E is in the middle).

 Choice: ""ROBED"" -> R, O, B, E, D? E is in fourth position? And avoids A, I, S? Yes.

 But we could also try ""RULED"": R, U, L, E, D? Also avoids A, I, S? Yes.

 However, note: the feedback from the first guess: R is first, E is not fifth. So in ""RULED"", E is fifth? Wait no: positions: 
   R (pos1), U (pos2), L (pos3), E (pos4), D (pos5). But we know E cannot be in fifth? Actually, the feedback for ""raise"": E at fifth position was marked as '-', meaning E is in the word but not at the fifth. So that doesn't forbid E from being at fifth? Actually, let me recheck:

 In ""raise"", the E was in the fifth position. The feedback for E: '-' meaning present but wrong position? But wait, the fifth position of ""raise"" got '-', so the secret word does have E, but not at the fifth position? Actually, the feedback symbol for E was '-', which according to the rules: 
   - : the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.

 So for E, because we put it at the fifth, but the secret word has E somewhere else? Therefore, E is in the word but not at fifth. Therefore, if we guess ""RULED"", we put E at fourth? Which is not fifth? So that is allowed? But we don't know if the secret word has E at fourth? Actually, we don't? So if we put E at fourth, we might get:

   If E is in the secret word at fourth: ✓
   If E is in the secret word but not at fourth, then -.

 But we already are sure E is present? Yes.

 However, we are trying to find where E goes.

 Also note: we must avoid using letters A, I, S.

 So, let's try to form a word without any repeated letters? Because repeated letters might complicate feedback? But not forbidden.

 Actually, we should try to use distinct letters to maximize the information? So no repeated letters.

 Since E is the only letter we know is present (besides R), we can try:

   R, and then four new distinct letters, plus E in one position 2, 3, or 4.

 But we don't want to use A, I, S. So we have lots of letters.

 Example: ""R"" + E in position 2? Then the letters for position 3,4,5 must be new? But we have to form a word.

 How about ""RETRY"": but R twice? and T and Y? Also, we know E? But then E is at position 2? Then positions 3 and 4: T, R? Wait, this word: 
   R E T R Y -> R at position 1 and 4? So double R? That might confuse? Also, the secret word may have only one R? We don't know? Feedback for R was ✓ at position 1? So if there is another R? Then we might see? But we don't have any prior indication.

 Alternatively, let's avoid repeated letters.

 Consider: ""ROUTE""? 
   - But E is at fifth? We know E is not at fifth? Because in the first guess, E was at fifth and got '-' meaning not at fifth? So if we guess E at fifth again? Then we are wasting? Because we already know E is not at fifth? Therefore, we must not put E at fifth in this next guess.

 So:

    We have three positions for E: 2, 3, 4.

 Another word: ""REPEL""? But E at positions 2 and 4? So we get E twice? Also P and L? And avoids A,I,S.

 Alternatively, ""RECUT"": 
   R (position1), E (position2), C (position3), U (position4), T (position5). 
   This has E at position 2? And no E doubled? And avoids A,I,S? Yes.

 But we don't know about C, U, T.

 Another: ""REGAL""? But G and L? Also avoids A,I,S? Actually, REGAL: has A? Wait, REGAL -> R E G A L? Oh, A at position 4? But we cannot use A? Because we know A is not in the secret word? So REGAL is invalid? Because it uses A, which we know isn't present.

 How about ""REIGN""? But has I? Invalid.

 ""RELET"": R E L E T? Avoids A,I,S? But has E doubled? Also, E in positions 2 and 4? Actually, RELET? Is that a word? I think not? Maybe RENT etc.

 For the sake of time, let me choose ""ROMEO""? But has O twice? And O? Also, is M present? And E? Wait, ""ROMEO"": R O M E O? 
   - Starts with R? Yes.
   - E is at position 4? That's valid (not fifth)? 
   - Avoids A, I, S? Yes? R, O, M, E, O? Actually, letters: R,O,M,E? And O repeated? But the word R O M E O? So is that valid? In dictionary? But the rules require valid English word? Romeo is a proper noun? Usually words should be common nouns or verbs? Let's assume it's allowed? Actually, Wordle usually allows common 5-letter words, including proper nouns? Or not? I don't recall.

 But also, the word has O repeated? We don't know if O appears twice? But that's acceptable? However, for maximizing information, repeated letters are inefficient.

 Another common word: ""ROBED"": 
   R (1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? 
   This avoids A, I, S? Yes.
   E is at position 4? So we want to test if E is at 4? If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at 4. If we get '-', then E is not at 4 but in another position? That could be 2 or 3? But note we haven't tested position 5? But we know E is not at 5? So E must be at 2 or 3? So if we put at 4 and get '-', then E is at 2 or 3? Similarly, if we put E at 4 and get ✓, then we lock position 4.

 Also, we can test letters O, B, D? 

 Alternatively, ""RULEE""? Not a word.

 I think ""ROBED"" is a reasonable choice? But let me check if it's a word? Yes, robed is an adjective meaning dressed? So acceptable.

 However, we already have R as first? Then R O B E D? Then the third position? We haven't tested? And we don't know if O, B, D are present.

 Another word: ""RECED""? No? ""RECEDE"" is 6 letters.

 How about ""REEDY""? But two E's? And Y? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? R E E D Y? So E in positions 2 and 3? Then D,Y? But we can get feedback on both E?

 Since we have limited guesses, why not focus on words that don't repeat letters? So I choose ""ROBED"".

 But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? But that's not known? But we are safe? For now, let's pick.

 Alternatively, ""RIPED""? Not a word.

 Or ""ROWED"": R O W E D? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? That's a word? ROWED: past tense of row? So acceptable.

 And letters: R, O, W, E, D? All distinct? Yes? And no repeated letters? Great.

 So with ""ROWED"":
   - R at first (we know so will be ✓)
   - O: new letter? If O is in the word? Then any position? We don't know?
   - W: new
   - E: in fourth position? Then we see what happens? 
   - D: new

 Also, we have E in fourth? So if E is in the word at fourth? We get ✓? Otherwise, we get '-'? And then we know E is at 2 or 3? So we can learn.

 But let's list:

   Position1: R (must be ✓ always)
   Position2: O -> we don't know? Could be anything? And similarly W at position3? Then E at position4? Then D at position5.

 So we get feedback for O, W, E, D? And W is not the best letter? But we can try.

 More common than W? How about ""ROTED""? Not a word? ""ROTED"" isn't a word? Or ""ROTATE"" is 6 letters? 

 ""RENTED""? Avoids A, I, S? Wait: R E N T E D? Has E twice and T? Also, E appears? But we have E at position2 and same condition? Also, length? 6 letters? Oh, RENTED is 6? 

 Actually, ""RENT""? Only 4 letters? 

 So ""ROWED"" or ""ROBED""? Or ""RULED""? ""RULED"": R U L E D? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? And distinct letters.

 ""RULED"": R (1), U(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)? 
   - E is at position4? We want to check E's position? Similar to ROBED? But with U,L instead of O,B? 

 Which one? Since we want common letters? Maybe RULED or ROBED? Both are common? 

 But note: the secret word might include one of these letters? We don't know? 

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that also tests common consonants: let's pick a word with T? Because T is very common? 

 How about ""RETCH"": 
   R (1), E(2), T(3), C(4), H(5)? 
   - This has E in position2? Which is a valid position? And avoids A,I,S? Yes? 
   - Letters: R, E, T, C, H? Distinct? Yes.

 And T is very common.

 So ""RETCH"" might be better? 

 Also, if E is at position2? We get:
   If ✓, then we know E is position2? 
   If - , then E is either position3 or 4? Because we know E is not in position5?

 So then we can lock position1 and position2? 

 Let me decide: ""RETCH"" is a valid word? Yes? Meaning to make a sharp cough sound? 

 So let's go with ""RETCH""?

 Summary of reasons for ""RETCH"":
   - Starts with R? ✔
   - Places E in position2 to test? 
   - Includes common consonants T, C, H? 
   - Avoids A, I, S? Yes.

 Thus, next guess: ""RETCH""

<guess>retch</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""raise"":
- **R** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **A**, **I**, and **S** are not in the word (x).
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
- The secret word starts with **R** (position 1).
- **E** is present but not in positions 1 or 5, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- **A**, **I**, and **S** are eliminated—avoid using these letters.
- The word contains at least **R** and **E**, with **E** misplaced.

For the next guess, prioritize:
- Starting with **R** to maintain position 1 certainty.
- Placing **E** in position 2, 3, or 4 to pinpoint its location (e.g., position 2).
- Testing new common consonants (""T"", ""C"", ""H"") to gather more information.
- Avoiding invalid letters: **A**, **I**, **S**.

**RETCH** fits perfectly:
- Valid English word (meaning to vomit or make a sharp sound).
- Starts with **R** (position 1).
- Places **E** in position 2 (tests if **E** is in position 2).
- Introduces new letters (**T**, **C**, **H**)—allowing feedback on their presence/position.
- No **A**, **I**, or **S**, adhering to constraints.

<guess>retch</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: retch -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) T(x) C(x) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two pieces of feedback:

From Guess 1 (""raise""):
- R ✓ (position 1 correct)
- A x (not in word)
- I x (not in word)
- S x (not in word)
- E - (in word, but not position 5)

From Guess 2 (""retch""):
- R ✓ (position 1 correct, as expected)
- E ✓ (position 2 correct! So E is now confirmed at position 2)
- T x (T not in word)
- C x (C not in word)
- H x (H not in word)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word starts with ""RE"" (positions 1 and 2 are R and E).
- We've eliminated A, I, S, T, C, H as possible letters.
- The word does not contain these letters: A, I, S, T, C, H.
- The remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding these: A, I, S, T, C, H (and including E, but it's already placed).

The secret word pattern: ""R E _ _ _""
Positions 3, 4, and 5 need to be filled with letters that are not A,I,S,T,C,H.

We also know from Guess 1 that E is in the word but not position 5. However, we now know E is at position 2, so that condition is satisfied.

We must form a 5-letter word in the pattern ""RE___"" that doesn't use A,I,S,T,C,H.

Additionally, we have unused letters to test. Common consonants like N, O, U, L, D, etc.

The word must be valid English.

To maximize information, we should test common letters in positions 3, 4, and 5.

We have 5 tries left? Wait: two guesses used, so 4 tries left? But originally 6, so after guess 2, we have 4 guesses left? But let's proceed.

We know the word starts with ""RE"". We need to guess the last three letters.

We also have eliminated several letters? So remaining letters: B,D,F,G,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and E? But E is fixed at position 2).

But E is already used? So for the remaining positions? Not? Actually, the secret word might contain repeated letters? So E could appear again? We don't know? But we have no reason to forbid doubles? However, we haven't seen doubles? But possible.

But the known letters: R and E? So if we put another E? Then in feedback we might see? For now? We can avoid? For simplicity? Or not? It's okay? Because we don't know.

But let's see: with pattern ""RE___"", we can form words.

We should choose a word that uses common letters we haven't tested? For example, we haven't tested N, L, D? etc.

Common suffixes for words that start with ""RE"": examples: ""RELAY"", but L? Then A? But A is eliminated? So ""RELAY"" invalid.

""REBEL"": E doubled? But it has B,E,L? Avoids A,I,S,T,C,H? Yes: B, E, L? Wait B, E, L? And pattern? ""REB E L""? Wait: R E B E L? Actually, ""REBEL"" has E in position 4? And E? So if we try ""REBEL"", we would have:
  Position: 1 R (✓), 2 E (✓), 3 B (testing), 4 E (testing for duplicate?), 5 L (testing?).

If the word has B? Then? Etc.

Alternatively, we can try a word with distinct new letters? So we avoid re-testing E? Since we already know E is in the word? And we don't know if it's duplicated? But we can get information? However, to maximize? Testing three new letters might be better.

Therefore, let's try a word without repeated letters? And avoid E? Or only one E? We already have E at position 2? We don't need to put E again? Unless we suspect duplication? But we have no evidence? So perhaps avoid duplicates.

Word: ""REbut""? Not five? Wait 5 letters?

""REBAR""? But A? A is invalid? No.

""REVEL"": V and L? Avoids A,I,S,T,C,H? Yes: V, E, L? But double E? Wait, ""REVEL""? Letters: R,E,V,E,L? So has E twice? Actually? It has E at position 2 and 4? So we are reusing E? But we know E? So possibly redundant? But V and L are new? So maybe.

But we get feedback on V and L? If we put E at position 4? And if the secret word has E? Then we might get ✓ for E? Or if duplicate? Then ✓ for E4? But if no duplicate? Then we get '-'? Or if E is only at 2? Then position 4 E would be wrong position? But we know E only at 2? Actually, we know it is in the word? But perhaps only at 2? So E at 4 might be extra? Then feedback for position 4? If E is not at 4 but E is in word? Then '-' for E? Because wrong position? But E is correctly placed? No? Not? Position 4? We don't know? So it can be '-?'.

Actually, the secret word might not have E at 4? Then feedback would mark E with '-' meaning it's in the word? But we already know E is in the word? So if we put E at 4, and if it's not present? Then it would be 'x'? So we can tell if E is duplicated? Or not.

But to avoid confusion? And save guesses? Use distinct letters.

Let me suggest ""REMOD""? Not a word? ""REMODEL"" too long? 

""REMOW""? Not word.

""REMUT""? Not word.

Common words: ""REIGN""? But I? I eliminated? We cannot use I? Since I is not present? And I is in ""REIGN""? So invalid.

""REPAY""? But P and A? Then A? A is invalid? So no.

""REPLY"": L and Y? Avoids A,I,S,T,C,H? Yes? Pattern: R E P L Y? Letters: R,E,P,L,Y? All distinct? No duplicates? And avoids forbidden letters? E included? But in the pattern? We are forced at positions 1 and 2? Then in ""REPLY"": position 3 P, position 4 L, position 5 Y? Perfect? 

Also ""REPLY"" is a common English word? Yes? Meaning to respond.

So with ""REPLY"", we can get feedback for:
  Position1: R (already ✓)
  Position2: E (already ✓)
  Position3: P? Is P in word? If yes? Where?
  Position4: L? Same?
  Position5: Y? Same?

Therefore, our guess: ""REPLY""

<guess>reply</guess>Based on previous feedback:

- **Guess 1 (raise)**: R is correct and in position 1 (✓), A/I/S are absent (x), E is present but not in position 5 (-).  
- **Guess 2 (retch)**: R and E are correct and in positions 1 and 2 (✓), T/C/H are absent (x).  

Key deductions:  
- The secret word starts with **""RE""** (positions 1 and 2 confirmed).  
- Eliminated letters: **A, I, S, T, C, H** (cannot appear anywhere).  
- The word pattern is **""RE___""**, with positions 3–5 unknown.  
- E is confirmed at position 2; positions 3–5 must use new letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding A,I,S,T,C,H).  

For the next guess:  
- Must start with ""RE"" and adhere to the pattern ""RE___"".  
- Prioritize testing common letters not yet tried (e.g., L, N, P, D, Y) to gather maximum information.  
- ""REPLY"" fits perfectly:  
  - Valid English word (meaning to respond).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters (A,I,S,T,C,H).  
  - Tests new letters: **P** (position 3), **L** (position 4), **Y** (position 5).  
- Feedback will reveal whether P, L, or Y are in the word and their positions.

<guess>reply</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: retch -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) T(x) C(x) H(x)
Guess 3: reply -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) P(x) L(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R(✓) : R is correct and in position 1.
- A(x) : A is not in the word.
- I(x) : I is not in the word.
- S(x) : S is not in the word.
- E(-) : E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""retch""
- R(✓) : R is correct and in position 1 (as expected).
- E(✓) : E is correct and in position 2 (so now we know positions 1 and 2 are R and E).
- T(x) : T is not in the word.
- C(x) : C is not in the word.
- H(x) : H is not in the word.

Guess 3: ""reply""
- R(✓) : R correct in position 1.
- E(✓) : E correct in position 2.
- P(x) : P is not in the word.
- L(x) : L is not in the word.
- Y(✓) : Y is correct and in position 5.

So now we know:
- The word starts with ""RE"" and ends with ""Y"", so the pattern is ""RE _ _ Y"".
- We have eliminated the following letters: A, I, S, T, C, H, P, L (all marked with x).
- The only letters we know are in the word: R, E, and Y (with R at 1, E at 2, Y at 5).
- We need to find the two middle letters (positions 3 and 4) from the remaining letters.

The secret word: R E ? ? Y

Eliminated letters: A, I, S, T, C, H, P, L.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (Note: E is already used, but we don't know if it can be repeated? However, we have no evidence of repetition so far, but it's possible. But since we have two positions to fill, we should consider the possibility.)

But note: in the first guess, E was marked as present but not at position 5, and now we have E at position 2. There could be another E? But we don't have any indication. However, we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any feedback suggesting duplicates? So we can assume no duplicates for now? But we should be cautious.

We have two positions: 3 and 4.

We need to form a valid English word that starts with ""RE"", ends with ""Y"", and has two letters in the middle from the remaining set, avoiding the eliminated letters.

Common words that fit the pattern ""RE _ _ Y"":
- ""READY"": but A is eliminated? A is not allowed? And D? But A is x? So no.
- ""REALY"": but A and L? L is eliminated? And also, ""REALY"" is not a common word? Actually, ""RELAY"" is a word? But L is eliminated? And A? Both are out.
- ""REBUS"": but S is eliminated? And U? But S is x? So no.
- ""RECKY"": but C is eliminated? And K? C is x? So no.
- ""REDDY"": has D? But also double D? And Y? But ""REDDY"" is a word? Meaning ready? But let's check: R E D D Y? So positions: 3 and 4 are D and D? But we have eliminated D? Actually, we haven't eliminated D? D is not in the eliminated list? Eliminated: A,I,S,T,C,H,P,L. So D is available? But we have two D's? So we need to consider if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven't seen any? However, we can try? But we are going to guess? We have to form a word.

But we don't know if D is in the word? We haven't tested D? So we can use D? Similarly, other letters.

Possible words:
- ""REDDY"": R E D D Y? But two D's? And we don't know if D is in the word? But we can test? However, we are limited to 4 guesses? We have 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3, so 3 left? But we can try.

But let's list possible words without duplicates first? Because duplicates might be less common? Or not? We don't know.

Words with distinct letters for positions 3 and 4? And ending with Y? And avoiding eliminated letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common words:
- ""RENEW"": but E? We already have E? And W? But ""RENEW"" has E at position 3? But we don't know if E is duplicated? And also, it ends with W? Not Y? So no? We need to end with Y.
- ""REBUY"": B and U? Avoids eliminated? Yes? R E B U Y? So positions: 3:B, 4:U? Then Y? So ""REBUY"" is a word? Meaning to buy again? Yes? Valid.
- ""REFER"": but ends with R? Not Y? And has E? Duplicate? So no.
- ""REIFY"": but I? I is eliminated? So no.
- ""RELAY"": but L and A? Both eliminated? No.
- ""REMAN"": but ends with N? Not Y? And A? Eliminated? No.
- ""REMIT"": T eliminated? No.
- ""RENAY"": but A? Eliminated? No.
- ""REPOT"": P and T? Both eliminated? No.
- ""RERUN"": R? Duplicate? And ends with N? Not Y? No.
- ""RESAY"": S and A? Eliminated? No.
- ""RESEW"": S? Eliminated? No.
- ""RETRY"": T? Eliminated? No.
- ""REUSE"": S? Eliminated? No.
- ""REVEL"": L? Eliminated? No.

So ""REBUY"" is a candidate? But we have to check if it uses only available letters? Yes: B, U? Both are available? And Y is already at the end? So ""REBUY"" is R E B U Y.

But we don't know if B and U are in the word? We are testing them? So we can get feedback.

Another candidate: ""REJIG""? But ends with G? Not Y? No.

""REJOY""? Not a word? 

""REKEY"": K and E? But E is already at position 2? So if we put E at position 4? Then we have two E's? But we don't know? ""REKEY"" is a word? Meaning to enter data again? Yes? But it has E at position 4? So R E K E Y? So positions: 3:K, 4:E? Then Y? But we have E at position 2 and 4? So duplicate E? And K? 

But we have eliminated K? No? K is available? So we can try? But we are testing for E duplication? 

But we have a candidate without duplication: ""REBUY"" (R E B U Y) with distinct letters? Yes? B and U are distinct? And not used before? 

Another candidate: ""REWAX"": W and A? A is eliminated? So no.

""REBOX"": O and X? But ends with X? Not Y? No.

""REBUY"" seems good? But let's see if there are others.

""REDUX"": D and U? But ends with X? Not Y? So no.

""REDYE"": D and Y? But Y is already at the end? And E? Duplicate? ""REDYE"" is R E D Y E? But we need to end with Y? So pattern? R E D Y E? That's 5 letters? But then position 5 is E? But we know Y is at position 5? So it must end with Y? So ""REDYE"" would have Y at position 4? And E at 5? But we know Y is at 5? So that doesn't match? We need the word to end with Y? So position 5 must be Y? So ""REDYE"" is not valid? Because it ends with E? 

We need the pattern: R E ? ? Y

So the fourth letter must be the one before Y? So position 4 is the fourth letter? Then position 5 is Y? So the word must be of the form: R E X Z Y, where X and Z are the letters for positions 3 and 4.

So ""REBUY"": positions: 3:B, 4:U, 5:Y? So that fits? 

Another word: ""REGUR"": but ends with R? Not Y? No.

""REJOG"": ends with G? No.

""REKEY"": as above? R E K E Y? But then position 4 is E? So we have E at 2 and 4? And position 3 is K? Then Y? So that also fits the pattern? But has duplicate E? 

But we don't know if duplicate E is allowed? So both are possible? 

But we have ""REBUY"" without duplicate? So let's prefer that? 

Another word: ""REMAP"": P? Eliminated? No? P is eliminated? From guess 3: P(x)? So we cannot use P? 

Similarly, L is eliminated? 

What about ""REWON""? Ends with N? No.

""REZONE"": O and N? But ends with E? Not Y? No.

""REVIEW"": I? Eliminated? And E? Duplicate? But I is not allowed? 

""REBUY"" and ""REKEY"" are two options? 

But ""REKEY"" has E at position 4? So if we guess ""REKEY"", we might get:

- Position 1: R ✓
- Position 2: E ✓
- Position 3: K? If K is in the word? But we don't know? 
- Position 4: E? If E is duplicated? Then ✓? Or if not? Then x? Or -? 
  - If the secret word has only one E (at position 2), then E at position 4 would be wrong? So it would be marked as x? Because not in the word? Or if it is in the word but wrong position? But if the word has only one E and it's at position 2, then E at 4 is not present? So x? 
  - But if the word has two E's? Then E at 4 might be ✓? Or if E is at another position? But we only have positions 3 and 4? And we know position 5 is Y? So if E is at position 3? Then E at 4 would be wrong? But we have E at 2? So if E is at 3? Then we have two E's? 

This is getting complicated? 

Alternatively, ""REBUY"" tests two new letters: B and U? Without duplication? So we get clear feedback? 

But we have to see if there are other words? 

Another word: ""REPAY""? But P and A? Both eliminated? No.

""REFRY"": F and R? But R is already used? And ends with Y? R E F R Y? So duplicate R? And F? 

But R is at position 1? So if we put R at position 4? Then we might get feedback? But we know R is in the word? But we don't know if duplicated? 

""REFRY"" is a word? Meaning to fry again? Yes? 

But we have eliminated F? No? F is available? 

So ""REFRY"": R E F R Y? Positions: 3:F, 4:R? Then Y? 

But we have R at position 1 and 4? So duplicate R? 

Similarly, we can consider? 

But let's list all possible words? We don't have time? 

Given the constraints, the possible words I can think of are:
- ""REBUY"" (R E B U Y)
- ""REKEY"" (R E K E Y)
- ""REFRY"" (R E F R Y)
- ""REDDY"" (R E D D Y) - with duplicate D

But ""REDDY"" has duplicate D? And we don't know if D is in the word? 

We need to choose one? 

Since we have Y at the end? And ""RE"" at the beginning? 

Another word: ""REBBY""? Not a word? 

""REJGY""? No.

""REMGY""? No.

""REVVY""? Not a word? 

""REWBY""? No.

So the common ones are ""REBUY"", ""REKEY"", ""REFRY"", and ""REDDY"". 

But ""REDDY"" might be considered a proper noun? But let's assume it's allowed? 

To maximize information? We should avoid duplicates? So ""REBUY"" is better? Because it tests two new letters? 

If we guess ""REBUY"", we get:
  Position 3: B? If present? Then ✓ or -? But since we are putting at 3? If it's in the word? Then if at 3? ✓? Else -? 
  Position 4: U? Similarly? 

But if we get both x? Then we know B and U are not in the word? Then we can try other letters? 

Similarly, if we get one of them? Then we know? 

But we have only two positions? So we might solve it? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters? For example, D? D is common? 

But in ""REBUY"", B and U? U is a vowel? Not as common? 

""REEDY"": but E? Duplicate? And D? But ""REEDY"" is R E E D Y? So positions: 3:E, 4:D? Then Y? But we have E at 2 and 3? So duplicate E? And D? But we need to end with Y? So position 5 is Y? So ""REEDY"" is R E E D Y? So position 3 is E? Position 4 is D? 

But we don't know if E is duplicated? 

But we have ""REEDY"" as a candidate? 

But we have to avoid? Because we have eliminated? No? 

But let's see: ""REEDY"" uses E and D? E is known? D is new? 

But we are testing position 3 and 4? 

But we have multiple candidates? 

Given the feedback, we know Y is at the end? So the word is ""RE _ _ Y"". 

We have to guess? 

But we have 3 guesses left? So we can try? 

I think ""REBUY"" is a reasonable guess? 

But let's see the feedback from guess 3: Y is at position 5? So we are sure? 

So I'll go with ""REBUY"". 

But wait? Is there a word ""REBUS""? But S is eliminated? So no? 

Another word: ""REBEL""? But L? Eliminated? And E? Duplicate? 

""REBAR""? A? Eliminated? 

So ""REBUY"" it is? 

But let's confirm: ""REBUY"" is a valid word? Yes? 

So guess: ""REBUY""

<guess>rebuy</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  
  - R(✓): Correct letter in position 1.  
  - A(x), I(x), S(x): A, I, S are **not** in the word.  
  - E(-): E is in the word but **not** in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""retch""**  
  - R(✓): Correct letter in position 1 (confirmed).  
  - E(✓): Correct letter in position 2 (new confirmation).  
  - T(x), C(x), H(x): T, C, H are **not** in the word.  

- **Guess 3: ""reply""**  
  - R(✓): Correct letter in position 1 (redundant).  
  - E(✓): Correct letter in position 2 (redundant).  
  - P(x), L(x): P and L are **not** in the word.  
  - Y(✓): Correct letter in position 5 (new confirmation).  

### Key Deductions
1. **Confirmed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **R**  
   - Position 2: **E**  
   - Position 5: **Y**  
   - The word pattern is **R E _ _ Y**.  

2. **Eliminated letters**:  
   - A, I, S, T, C, H, P, L (cannot appear anywhere).  

3. **Remaining unknown**:  
   - Positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters **not** eliminated.  
   - Valid letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
   - No duplicates confirmed yet, but possible (e.g., double E or other letters).  

4. **Possible words**:  
   - Must be a valid English word matching **R E _ _ Y**.  
   - Common options:  
     - **REBUY** (meaning: to buy again) → Tests B (pos 3) and U (pos 4).  
     - **REKEY** (meaning: to reprogram a key) → Tests K (pos 3) and E (pos 4; tests for E duplication).  
     - **REFRY** (meaning: to fry again) → Tests F (pos 3) and R (pos 4; tests for R duplication).  
   - **REBUY** is prioritized:  
     - Uses distinct new letters (B and U) to maximize information.  
     - Avoids duplicates, simplifying feedback.  
     - Common and valid 5-letter word.  

### Next Guess: ""REBUY""
- Tests **B** in position 3 and **U** in position 4.  
- If B or U are correct, feedback will reveal their positions/absence.  
- If both are absent, we eliminate B/U and narrow options further.

Since I don\'t have any prior feedback, I should start with a word that maximizes the information I can get. That means choosing a word with common letters and no repeating letters to cover more possibilities.\n\nI recall that in games like Wordle, good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. For example, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROBIN"" are commonly used because they contain frequent letters.\n\nLet me list out some common vowels and consonants in English 5-letter words:\n- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but I\'ll avoid it for now)\n- Consonants: R, T, N, S, L, C, D, M, etc.\n\nA good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants to cover different possibilities. I should avoid words with repeated letters because that reduces the amount of unique information I get.\n\nPossible words:\n- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E → covers C, R, A, N, E. All unique letters.\n- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E → S, L, A, T, E. Also good.\n- AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O → lots of vowels, but might not cover common consonants well.\n- STERN: S, T, E, R, N → solid.\n\nAnother one I\'ve heard is ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E → includes R, A, I, S, E.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it has common letters and no repeats.\n\nBut let me confirm the rules: I need a valid 5-letter English word. All these are valid.\n\nTo be systematic, I can choose a word that includes letters that appear frequently in English words. According to sources, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, etc.\n\nSo, incorporating those:\n- ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E → covers I, R, A, T, E.\n- ""ORATE"": O, R, A, T, E.\n- ""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U → many vowels, but D and U are less common.\n\n""ADIEU"" is good for vowels, but consonants might be better to include.\n\nPerhaps ""SLANT"": S, L, A, N, T.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s pick one. I\'ll go with ""RAISE"" for now. R, A, I, S, E are all very common.\n\nAfter this guess, I\'ll get feedback like ✓, -, or x for each position, which will help me narrow down the possibilities.\n\nSince it\'s the first guess, I don\'t overthink it.\n\nSo, my first guess: RAISE.\n\nIn the response format, I need to think step by step intags, then output the guess.\n\nFirst, I\'ll think: I\'m starting with ""RAISE"" because it contains common letters like R, A, I, S, E, which are frequent in English words, and it has no repeating letters, which helps in getting more information from the feedback.\n</think>\nFor my first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that maximizes information gain. Since I have no prior feedback, I should select a word with common letters and no repeats to cover a broad range of possibilities. Common vowels like A, E, I and consonants like R, S are good choices. A word like ""RAISE"" is ideal because:\n- It contains R, A, I, S, E—all high-frequency letters in English.\n- Each letter is unique, so feedback on each position will be clear.\n- This word is a valid English word, so it adheres to the rules.\n\nAfter this guess, the feedback will help me identify correct letters and positions for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"":\n - R: ✓ (correct letter and position)\n - A: x (not in the word)\n - I: x (not in the word)\n - S: x (not in the word)\n - E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\n So, we know:\n - The letter R is in the word and at the first position.\n - The letters A, I, S are not in the word at all.\n - The letter E is somewhere in the word, but not in the fifth position.\n\n We also have used 1 guess and have 5 tries left.\n\n The secret word:\n - Starts with R: so pattern is R _ _ _ _\n - Contains E (but not in the 5th position) and does not contain A, I, S.\n - Therefore, the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding A, I, S (and also excluding R and E that we know about, though E is in the word but elsewhere).\n\n Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Now, for the next guess:\n - We must form a valid 5-letter word starting with R (since the first position is confirmed).\n - We must include E in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4 (to help locate it) and avoid letters A, I, S.\n - We can also include other common letters to test for presence.\n\n Considering the constraints, let\'s choose a word that:\n   - Starts with R\n   - Has E in position 2, 3, or 4 (we\'ll try position 3 for example to see)\n   - Uses other letters we haven\'t ruled out, like N, T, L, O, U, etc.\n\n Example: ""REBEL"" is not good because E is in position 2 and 4, but we don\'t want redundant E? Also we know E is present once? Wait, the secret word might have multiple Es? The feedback only shows that at least one E exists. But in ""raise"" we have one E and the feedback says E is present but not in the fifth position. However, we don\'t know if there are multiple Es.\n\n But note: the word must not contain A, I, S.\n\n However, ""REBEL"" contains E twice and we don\'t know if the word has two Es. Also, it uses B and L? But we don\'t know about them.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s try ""RECUT"": but does it have E? It has E in position 2, but then C and U and T? However, we might avoid uncommon letters? \n\n Actually, we should choose a word that maximizes new information and uses common letters.\n\n Another idea: ""RODEO"" but contains O twice? And has A? No, RODEO does not have A? Actually, RODEO doesn\'t contain A, I, S? But wait: RODEO has O twice? And we don\'t know if doubles are allowed? But the secret word might have repeated letters? The feedback so far doesn\'t suggest that the word has doubles? Since we only have R and E as known letters.\n\n Let me think of words that start with R and include E (not fifth) and avoid A, I, S.\n\n Common options:\n   - ""ROUTE"": R then O, U, T, E -> E is in fifth, but we know E is not in fifth. So we must avoid fifth position for E? Exactly. We need E in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\n   - ""REACH"": but has A -> invalid because A is not present (as per feedback: A is x, meaning A is not in the word). So we must avoid A.\n\n   - Words without A, I, S: so letters to choose from: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n   - And we must include E (somewhere in positions 2-4).\n\n   Suggestions:\n      ""REBEL"": E is at positions 2 and 4? But we don\'t know if the word has two Es? And we don\'t know if we can get extra information? However, we don\'t have information for letters B and L.\n\n      ""RENEW"": E at 2 and 4? Same issue.\n\n      ""RETCH"": E in position 2, then T, C, H? That might work.\n\n      ""RENAL"": but N, A? Wait, A is excluded. ""RENAL"" has A? So no.\n\n      ""REVEL"": E at 2 and 4? Also V and L.\n\n How about ""ROTATE""? But has A? Not allowed.\n\n Wait, note: we know the word does not have A, I, S.\n\n Let me suggest: ""RINSE"" -> but I? We cannot use I because we know I is not present.\n\n Actually, we must avoid I as well.\n\n Another word: ""RESET"" -> but S? Feedback said S is not present. So we must avoid S? Exactly. So ""RESET"" is not allowed because it has S.\n\n What about ""REVEL""? Let\'s check: R, E, V, E, L? Doesn\'t have A, I, S? So it\'s okay? But we have E twice. But the secret word might only have one E? We don\'t know. But we can get feedback for E twice? However, if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E\'s will get a \'✓\' or \'-\' and the other will get an \'x\'? Actually, we\'ll see.\n\n But we have to get letters we haven\'t tested yet.\n\n Alternatively, to avoid multiple E\'s, we could choose a word with E in a new position and four new letters? But we have to use E because we know it\'s in the word somewhere (but not at the start and not at the end? Wait, start is R, so E is in the middle).\n\n Choice: ""ROBED"" -> R, O, B, E, D? E is in fourth position? And avoids A, I, S? Yes.\n\n But we could also try ""RULED"": R, U, L, E, D? Also avoids A, I, S? Yes.\n\n However, note: the feedback from the first guess: R is first, E is not fifth. So in ""RULED"", E is fifth? Wait no: positions: \n   R (pos1), U (pos2), L (pos3), E (pos4), D (pos5). But we know E cannot be in fifth? Actually, the feedback for ""raise"": E at fifth position was marked as \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not at the fifth. So that doesn\'t forbid E from being at fifth? Actually, let me recheck:\n\n In ""raise"", the E was in the fifth position. The feedback for E: \'-\' meaning present but wrong position? But wait, the fifth position of ""raise"" got \'-\', so the secret word does have E, but not at the fifth position? Actually, the feedback symbol for E was \'-\', which according to the rules: \n   - : the letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.\n\n So for E, because we put it at the fifth, but the secret word has E somewhere else? Therefore, E is in the word but not at fifth. Therefore, if we guess ""RULED"", we put E at fourth? Which is not fifth? So that is allowed? But we don\'t know if the secret word has E at fourth? Actually, we don\'t? So if we put E at fourth, we might get:\n\n   If E is in the secret word at fourth: ✓\n   If E is in the secret word but not at fourth, then -.\n\n But we already are sure E is present? Yes.\n\n However, we are trying to find where E goes.\n\n Also note: we must avoid using letters A, I, S.\n\n So, let\'s try to form a word without any repeated letters? Because repeated letters might complicate feedback? But not forbidden.\n\n Actually, we should try to use distinct letters to maximize the information? So no repeated letters.\n\n Since E is the only letter we know is present (besides R), we can try:\n\n   R, and then four new distinct letters, plus E in one position 2, 3, or 4.\n\n But we don\'t want to use A, I, S. So we have lots of letters.\n\n Example: ""R"" + E in position 2? Then the letters for position 3,4,5 must be new? But we have to form a word.\n\n How about ""RETRY"": but R twice? and T and Y? Also, we know E? But then E is at position 2? Then positions 3 and 4: T, R? Wait, this word: \n   R E T R Y -> R at position 1 and 4? So double R? That might confuse? Also, the secret word may have only one R? We don\'t know? Feedback for R was ✓ at position 1? So if there is another R? Then we might see? But we don\'t have any prior indication.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s avoid repeated letters.\n\n Consider: ""ROUTE""? \n   - But E is at fifth? We know E is not at fifth? Because in the first guess, E was at fifth and got \'-\' meaning not at fifth? So if we guess E at fifth again? Then we are wasting? Because we already know E is not at fifth? Therefore, we must not put E at fifth in this next guess.\n\n So:\n\n    We have three positions for E: 2, 3, 4.\n\n Another word: ""REPEL""? But E at positions 2 and 4? So we get E twice? Also P and L? And avoids A,I,S.\n\n Alternatively, ""RECUT"": \n   R (position1), E (position2), C (position3), U (position4), T (position5). \n   This has E at position 2? And no E doubled? And avoids A,I,S? Yes.\n\n But we don\'t know about C, U, T.\n\n Another: ""REGAL""? But G and L? Also avoids A,I,S? Actually, REGAL: has A? Wait, REGAL -> R E G A L? Oh, A at position 4? But we cannot use A? Because we know A is not in the secret word? So REGAL is invalid? Because it uses A, which we know isn\'t present.\n\n How about ""REIGN""? But has I? Invalid.\n\n ""RELET"": R E L E T? Avoids A,I,S? But has E doubled? Also, E in positions 2 and 4? Actually, RELET? Is that a word? I think not? Maybe RENT etc.\n\n For the sake of time, let me choose ""ROMEO""? But has O twice? And O? Also, is M present? And E? Wait, ""ROMEO"": R O M E O? \n   - Starts with R? Yes.\n   - E is at position 4? That\'s valid (not fifth)? \n   - Avoids A, I, S? Yes? R, O, M, E, O? Actually, letters: R,O,M,E? And O repeated? But the word R O M E O? So is that valid? In dictionary? But the rules require valid English word? Romeo is a proper noun? Usually words should be common nouns or verbs? Let\'s assume it\'s allowed? Actually, Wordle usually allows common 5-letter words, including proper nouns? Or not? I don\'t recall.\n\n But also, the word has O repeated? We don\'t know if O appears twice? But that\'s acceptable? However, for maximizing information, repeated letters are inefficient.\n\n Another common word: ""ROBED"": \n   R (1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? \n   This avoids A, I, S? Yes.\n   E is at position 4? So we want to test if E is at 4? If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at 4. If we get \'-\', then E is not at 4 but in another position? That could be 2 or 3? But note we haven\'t tested position 5? But we know E is not at 5? So E must be at 2 or 3? So if we put at 4 and get \'-\', then E is at 2 or 3? Similarly, if we put E at 4 and get ✓, then we lock position 4.\n\n Also, we can test letters O, B, D? \n\n Alternatively, ""RULEE""? Not a word.\n\n I think ""ROBED"" is a reasonable choice? But let me check if it\'s a word? Yes, robed is an adjective meaning dressed? So acceptable.\n\n However, we already have R as first? Then R O B E D? Then the third position? We haven\'t tested? And we don\'t know if O, B, D are present.\n\n Another word: ""RECED""? No? ""RECEDE"" is 6 letters.\n\n How about ""REEDY""? But two E\'s? And Y? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? R E E D Y? So E in positions 2 and 3? Then D,Y? But we can get feedback on both E?\n\n Since we have limited guesses, why not focus on words that don\'t repeat letters? So I choose ""ROBED"".\n\n But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? But that\'s not known? But we are safe? For now, let\'s pick.\n\n Alternatively, ""RIPED""? Not a word.\n\n Or ""ROWED"": R O W E D? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? That\'s a word? ROWED: past tense of row? So acceptable.\n\n And letters: R, O, W, E, D? All distinct? Yes? And no repeated letters? Great.\n\n So with ""ROWED"":\n   - R at first (we know so will be ✓)\n   - O: new letter? If O is in the word? Then any position? We don\'t know?\n   - W: new\n   - E: in fourth position? Then we see what happens? \n   - D: new\n\n Also, we have E in fourth? So if E is in the word at fourth? We get ✓? Otherwise, we get \'-\'? And then we know E is at 2 or 3? So we can learn.\n\n But let\'s list:\n\n   Position1: R (must be ✓ always)\n   Position2: O -> we don\'t know? Could be anything? And similarly W at position3? Then E at position4? Then D at position5.\n\n So we get feedback for O, W, E, D? And W is not the best letter? But we can try.\n\n More common than W? How about ""ROTED""? Not a word? ""ROTED"" isn\'t a word? Or ""ROTATE"" is 6 letters? \n\n ""RENTED""? Avoids A, I, S? Wait: R E N T E D? Has E twice and T? Also, E appears? But we have E at position2 and same condition? Also, length? 6 letters? Oh, RENTED is 6? \n\n Actually, ""RENT""? Only 4 letters? \n\n So ""ROWED"" or ""ROBED""? Or ""RULED""? ""RULED"": R U L E D? Avoids A,I,S? Yes? And distinct letters.\n\n ""RULED"": R (1), U(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)? \n   - E is at position4? We want to check E\'s position? Similar to ROBED? But with U,L instead of O,B? \n\n Which one? Since we want common letters? Maybe RULED or ROBED? Both are common? \n\n But note: the secret word might include one of these letters? We don\'t know? \n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that also tests common consonants: let\'s pick a word with T? Because T is very common? \n\n How about ""RETCH"": \n   R (1), E(2), T(3), C(4), H(5)? \n   - This has E in position2? Which is a valid position? And avoids A,I,S? Yes? \n   - Letters: R, E, T, C, H? Distinct? Yes.\n\n And T is very common.\n\n So ""RETCH"" might be better? \n\n Also, if E is at position2? We get:\n   If ✓, then we know E is position2? \n   If - , then E is either position3 or 4? Because we know E is not in position5?\n\n So then we can lock position1 and position2? \n\n Let me decide: ""RETCH"" is a valid word? Yes? Meaning to make a sharp cough sound? \n\n So let\'s go with ""RETCH""?\n\n Summary of reasons for ""RETCH"":\n   - Starts with R? ✔\n   - Places E in position2 to test? \n   - Includes common consonants T, C, H? \n   - Avoids A, I, S? Yes.\n\n Thus, next guess: ""RETCH""\n\n<guess>retch</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""raise"":\n- **R** is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- **A**, **I**, and **S** are not in the word (x).\n- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word starts with **R** (position 1).\n- **E** is present but not in positions 1 or 5, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n- **A**, **I**, and **S** are eliminated—avoid using these letters.\n- The word contains at least **R** and **E**, with **E** misplaced.\n\nFor the next guess, prioritize:\n- Starting with **R** to maintain position 1 certainty.\n- Placing **E** in position 2, 3, or 4 to pinpoint its location (e.g., position 2).\n- Testing new common consonants (""T"", ""C"", ""H"") to gather more information.\n- Avoiding invalid letters: **A**, **I**, **S**.\n\n**RETCH** fits perfectly:\n- Valid English word (meaning to vomit or make a sharp sound).\n- Starts with **R** (position 1).\n- Places **E** in position 2 (tests if **E** is in position 2).\n- Introduces new letters (**T**, **C**, **H**)—allowing feedback on their presence/position.\n- No **A**, **I**, or **S**, adhering to constraints.\n\n<guess>retch</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: retch -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) T(x) C(x) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two pieces of feedback:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""raise""):\n- R ✓ (position 1 correct)\n- A x (not in word)\n- I x (not in word)\n- S x (not in word)\n- E - (in word, but not position 5)\n\nFrom Guess 2 (""retch""):\n- R ✓ (position 1 correct, as expected)\n- E ✓ (position 2 correct!

Wait: two guesses used, so 4 tries left? But originally 6, so after guess 2, we have 4 guesses left? But let\'s proceed.\n\nWe know the word starts with ""RE"". We need to guess the last three letters.\n\nWe also have eliminated several letters? So remaining letters: B,D,F,G,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and E? But E is fixed at position 2).\n\nBut E is already used? So for the remaining positions? Not? Actually, the secret word might contain repeated letters? So E could appear again? We don\'t know? But we have no reason to forbid doubles? However, we haven\'t seen doubles? But possible.\n\nBut the known letters: R and E? So if we put another E? Then in feedback we might see? For now? We can avoid? For simplicity? Or not? It\'s okay? Because we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s see: with pattern ""RE___"", we can form words.\n\nWe should choose a word that uses common letters we haven\'t tested? For example, we haven\'t tested N, L, D? etc.\n\nCommon suffixes for words that start with ""RE"": examples: ""RELAY"", but L? Then A? But A is eliminated? So ""RELAY"" invalid.\n\n""REBEL"": E doubled? But it has B,E,L? Avoids A,I,S,T,C,H? Yes: B, E, L? Wait B, E, L? And pattern? ""REB E L""? Wait: R E B E L? Actually, ""REBEL"" has E in position 4? And E? So if we try ""REBEL"", we would have:\n  Position: 1 R (✓), 2 E (✓), 3 B (testing), 4 E (testing for duplicate?), 5 L (testing?).\n\nIf the word has B? Then? Etc.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with distinct new letters? So we avoid re-testing E? Since we already know E is in the word? And we don\'t know if it\'s duplicated? But we can get information? However, to maximize? Testing three new letters might be better.\n\nTherefore, let\'s try a word without repeated letters? And avoid E? Or only one E? We already have E at position 2? We don\'t need to put E again? Unless we suspect duplication? But we have no evidence? So perhaps avoid duplicates.\n\nWord: ""REbut""? Not five? Wait 5 letters?\n\n""REBAR""? But A? A is invalid? No.\n\n""REVEL"": V and L? Avoids A,I,S,T,C,H? Yes: V, E, L? But double E? Wait, ""REVEL""? Letters: R,E,V,E,L? So has E twice? Actually? It has E at position 2 and 4? So we are reusing E? But we know E? So possibly redundant? But V and L are new? So maybe.\n\nBut we get feedback on V and L? If we put E at position 4? And if the secret word has E? Then we might get ✓ for E? Or if duplicate? Then ✓ for E4? But if no duplicate? Then we get \'-\'? Or if E is only at 2? Then position 4 E would be wrong position? But we know E only at 2? Actually, we know it is in the word? But perhaps only at 2? So E at 4 might be extra? Then feedback for position 4? If E is not at 4 but E is in word? Then \'-\' for E? Because wrong position? But E is correctly placed? No? Not? Position 4? We don\'t know? So it can be \'-?\'.\n\nActually, the secret word might not have E at 4? Then feedback would mark E with \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word? But we already know E is in the word? So if we put E at 4, and if it\'s not present? Then it would be \'x\'? So we can tell if E is duplicated? Or not.\n\nBut to avoid confusion? And save guesses? Use distinct letters.\n\nLet me suggest ""REMOD""? Not a word? ""REMODEL"" too long? \n\n""REMOW""? Not word.\n\n""REMUT""? Not word.\n\nCommon words: ""REIGN""? But I? I eliminated? We cannot use I? Since I is not present? And I is in ""REIGN""? So invalid.\n\n""REPAY""? But P and A? Then A? A is invalid? So no.\n\n""REPLY"": L and Y? Avoids A,I,S,T,C,H? Yes? Pattern: R E P L Y? Letters: R,E,P,L,Y? All distinct? No duplicates? And avoids forbidden letters? E included? But in the pattern? We are forced at positions 1 and 2? Then in ""REPLY"": position 3 P, position 4 L, position 5 Y? Perfect? \n\nAlso ""REPLY"" is a common English word? Yes? Meaning to respond.\n\nSo with ""REPLY"", we can get feedback for:\n  Position1: R (already ✓)\n  Position2: E (already ✓)\n  Position3: P? Is P in word? If yes? Where?\n  Position4: L? Same?\n  Position5: Y? Same?\n\nTherefore, our guess: ""REPLY""\n\n<guess>reply</guess>Based on previous feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1 (raise)**: R is correct and in position 1 (✓), A/I/S are absent (x), E is present but not in position 5 (-).  \n- **Guess 2 (retch)**: R and E are correct and in positions 1 and 2 (✓), T/C/H are absent (x).  \n\nKey deductions:  \n- The secret word starts with **""RE""** (positions 1 and 2 confirmed).  \n- Eliminated letters: **A, I, S, T, C, H** (cannot appear anywhere).  \n- The word pattern is **""RE___""**, with positions 3–5 unknown.  \n- E is confirmed at position 2; positions 3–5 must use new letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding A,I,S,T,C,H).  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Must start with ""RE"" and adhere to the pattern ""RE___"".  \n- Prioritize testing common letters not yet tried (e.g., L, N, P, D, Y) to gather maximum information.  \n- ""REPLY"" fits perfectly:  \n  - Valid English word (meaning to respond).  \n  - Avoids eliminated letters (A,I,S,T,C,H).  \n  - Tests new letters: **P** (position 3), **L** (position 4), **Y** (position 5).  \n- Feedback will reveal whether P, L, or Y are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>reply</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: retch -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) T(x) C(x) H(x)\nGuess 3: reply -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) P(x) L(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""raise""\n- R(✓) : R is correct and in position 1.\n- A(x) : A is not in the word.\n- I(x) : I is not in the word.\n- S(x) : S is not in the word.\n- E(-) : E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""retch""\n- R(✓) : R is correct and in position 1 (as expected).\n- E(✓) : E is correct and in position 2 (so now we know positions 1 and 2 are R and E).\n- T(x) : T is not in the word.\n- C(x) : C is not in the word.\n- H(x) : H is not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: ""reply""\n- R(✓) : R correct in position 1.\n- E(✓) : E correct in position 2.\n- P(x) : P is not in the word.\n- L(x) : L is not in the word.\n- Y(✓) : Y is correct and in position 5.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The word starts with ""RE"" and ends with ""Y"", so the pattern is ""RE _ _ Y"".\n- We have eliminated the following letters: A, I, S, T, C, H, P, L (all marked with x).\n- The only letters we know are in the word: R, E, and Y (with R at 1, E at 2, Y at 5).\n- We need to find the two middle letters (positions 3 and 4) from the remaining letters.\n\nThe secret word: R E ? ? Y\n\nEliminated letters: A, I, S, T, C, H, P, L.\n\nRemaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (Note: E is already used, but we don\'t know if it can be repeated? However, we have no evidence of repetition so far, but it\'s possible. But since we have two positions to fill, we should consider the possibility.)\n\nBut note: in the first guess, E was marked as present but not at position 5, and now we have E at position 2. There could be another E? But we don\'t have any indication. However, we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven\'t seen any feedback suggesting duplicates? So we can assume no duplicates for now? But we should be cautious.\n\nWe have two positions: 3 and 4.\n\nWe need to form a valid English word that starts with ""RE"", ends with ""Y"", and has two letters in the middle from the remaining set, avoiding the eliminated letters.\n\nCommon words that fit the pattern ""RE _ _ Y"":\n- ""READY"": but A is eliminated? A is not allowed? And D? But A is x? So no.\n- ""REALY"": but A and L? L is eliminated? And also, ""REALY"" is not a common word? Actually, ""RELAY"" is a word? But L is eliminated? And A? Both are out.\n- ""REBUS"": but S is eliminated? And U? But S is x? So no.\n- ""RECKY"": but C is eliminated? And K? C is x? So no.\n- ""REDDY"": has D? But also double D? And Y? But ""REDDY"" is a word? Meaning ready? But let\'s check: R E D D Y? So positions: 3 and 4 are D and D? But we have eliminated D? Actually, we haven\'t eliminated D? D is not in the eliminated list? Eliminated: A,I,S,T,C,H,P,L. So D is available? But we have two D\'s? So we need to consider if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven\'t seen any? However, we can try? But we are going to guess? We have to form a word.\n\nBut we don\'t know if D is in the word? We haven\'t tested D? So we can use D? Similarly, other letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""REDDY"": R E D D Y? But two D\'s? And we don\'t know if D is in the word? But we can test? However, we are limited to 4 guesses? We have 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3, so 3 left? But we can try.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words without duplicates first? Because duplicates might be less common? Or not? We don\'t know.\n\nWords with distinct letters for positions 3 and 4? And ending with Y? And avoiding eliminated letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""RENEW"": but E? We already have E? And W? But ""RENEW"" has E at position 3? But we don\'t know if E is duplicated? And also, it ends with W? Not Y? So no? We need to end with Y.\n- ""REBUY"": B and U? Avoids eliminated? Yes? R E B U Y? So positions: 3:B, 4:U? Then Y? So ""REBUY"" is a word? Meaning to buy again? Yes? Valid.\n- ""REFER"": but ends with R? Not Y? And has E? Duplicate? So no.\n- ""REIFY"": but I? I is eliminated? So no.\n- ""RELAY"": but L and A? Both eliminated? No.\n- ""REMAN"": but ends with N? Not Y? And A? Eliminated? No.\n- ""REMIT"": T eliminated? No.\n- ""RENAY"": but A? Eliminated? No.\n- ""REPOT"": P and T? Both eliminated? No.\n- ""RERUN"": R? Duplicate? And ends with N? Not Y? No.\n- ""RESAY"": S and A? Eliminated? No.\n- ""RESEW"": S? Eliminated? No.\n- ""RETRY"": T? Eliminated? No.\n- ""REUSE"": S? Eliminated? No.\n- ""REVEL"": L? Eliminated? No.\n\nSo ""REBUY"" is a candidate? But we have to check if it uses only available letters? Yes: B, U? Both are available? And Y is already at the end? So ""REBUY"" is R E B U Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if B and U are in the word? We are testing them? So we can get feedback.\n\nAnother candidate: ""REJIG""? But ends with G? Not Y? No.\n\n""REJOY""? Not a word? \n\n""REKEY"": K and E? But E is already at position 2? So if we put E at position 4? Then we have two E\'s? But we don\'t know? ""REKEY"" is a word? Meaning to enter data again? Yes? But it has E at position 4? So R E K E Y? So positions: 3:K, 4:E? Then Y? But we have E at position 2 and 4? So duplicate E? And K? \n\nBut we have eliminated K? No? K is available? So we can try? But we are testing for E duplication? \n\nBut we have a candidate without duplication: ""REBUY"" (R E B U Y) with distinct letters? Yes? B and U are distinct? And not used before? \n\nAnother candidate: ""REWAX"": W and A? A is eliminated? So no.\n\n""REBOX"": O and X? But ends with X? Not Y? No.\n\n""REBUY"" seems good? But let\'s see if there are others.\n\n""REDUX"": D and U? But ends with X? Not Y? So no.\n\n""REDYE"": D and Y? But Y is already at the end? And E? Duplicate? ""REDYE"" is R E D Y E? But we need to end with Y? So pattern? R E D Y E? That\'s 5 letters? But then position 5 is E? But we know Y is at position 5? So it must end with Y? So ""REDYE"" would have Y at position 4? And E at 5? But we know Y is at 5? So that doesn\'t match? We need the word to end with Y? So position 5 must be Y? So ""REDYE"" is not valid? Because it ends with E? \n\nWe need the pattern: R E ? ? Y\n\nSo the fourth letter must be the one before Y? So position 4 is the fourth letter? Then position 5 is Y? So the word must be of the form: R E X Z Y, where X and Z are the letters for positions 3 and 4.\n\nSo ""REBUY"": positions: 3:B, 4:U, 5:Y? So that fits? \n\nAnother word: ""REGUR"": but ends with R? Not Y? No.\n\n""REJOG"": ends with G? No.\n\n""REKEY"": as above? R E K E Y? But then position 4 is E? So we have E at 2 and 4? And position 3 is K? Then Y? So that also fits the pattern? But has duplicate E? \n\nBut we don\'t know if duplicate E is allowed? So both are possible? \n\nBut we have ""REBUY"" without duplicate? So let\'s prefer that? \n\nAnother word: ""REMAP"": P? Eliminated? No? P is eliminated? From guess 3: P(x)? So we cannot use P? \n\nSimilarly, L is eliminated? \n\nWhat about ""REWON""? Ends with N? No.\n\n""REZONE"": O and N? But ends with E? Not Y? No.\n\n""REVIEW"": I? Eliminated? And E? Duplicate? But I is not allowed? \n\n""REBUY"" and ""REKEY"" are two options? \n\nBut ""REKEY"" has E at position 4? So if we guess ""REKEY"", we might get:\n\n- Position 1: R ✓\n- Position 2: E ✓\n- Position 3: K? If K is in the word? But we don\'t know? \n- Position 4: E? If E is duplicated? Then ✓? Or if not? Then x? Or -? \n  - If the secret word has only one E (at position 2), then E at position 4 would be wrong? So it would be marked as x? Because not in the word? Or if it is in the word but wrong position? But if the word has only one E and it\'s at position 2, then E at 4 is not present? So x? \n  - But if the word has two E\'s? Then E at 4 might be ✓? Or if E is at another position? But we only have positions 3 and 4? And we know position 5 is Y? So if E is at position 3? Then E at 4 would be wrong? But we have E at 2? So if E is at 3? Then we have two E\'s? \n\nThis is getting complicated? \n\nAlternatively, ""REBUY"" tests two new letters: B and U? Without duplication? So we get clear feedback? \n\nBut we have to see if there are other words? \n\nAnother word: ""REPAY""? But P and A? Both eliminated? No.\n\n""REFRY"": F and R? But R is already used? And ends with Y? R E F R Y? So duplicate R? And F? \n\nBut R is at position 1? So if we put R at position 4? Then we might get feedback? But we know R is in the word? But we don\'t know if duplicated? \n\n""REFRY"" is a word? Meaning to fry again? Yes? \n\nBut we have eliminated F? No? F is available? \n\nSo ""REFRY"": R E F R Y? Positions: 3:F, 4:R? Then Y? \n\nBut we have R at position 1 and 4? So duplicate R? \n\nSimilarly, we can consider? \n\nBut let\'s list all possible words? We don\'t have time? \n\nGiven the constraints, the possible words I can think of are:\n- ""REBUY"" (R E B U Y)\n- ""REKEY"" (R E K E Y)\n- ""REFRY"" (R E F R Y)\n- ""REDDY"" (R E D D Y) - with duplicate D\n\nBut ""REDDY"" has duplicate D? And we don\'t know if D is in the word? \n\nWe need to choose one? \n\nSince we have Y at the end? And ""RE"" at the beginning? \n\nAnother word: ""REBBY""? Not a word? \n\n""REJGY""? No.\n\n""REMGY""? No.\n\n""REVVY""? Not a word? \n\n""REWBY""? No.\n\nSo the common ones are ""REBUY"", ""REKEY"", ""REFRY"", and ""REDDY"". \n\nBut ""REDDY"" might be considered a proper noun? But let\'s assume it\'s allowed? \n\nTo maximize information? We should avoid duplicates? So ""REBUY"" is better? Because it tests two new letters? \n\nIf we guess ""REBUY"", we get:\n  Position 3: B? If present? Then ✓ or -? But since we are putting at 3? If it\'s in the word? Then if at 3? ✓? Else -? \n  Position 4: U? Similarly? \n\nBut if we get both x? Then we know B and U are not in the word? Then we can try other letters? \n\nSimilarly, if we get one of them? Then we know? \n\nBut we have only two positions? So we might solve it? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters? For example, D? D is common? \n\nBut in ""REBUY"", B and U? U is a vowel? Not as common? \n\n""REEDY"": but E? Duplicate? And D? But ""REEDY"" is R E E D Y? So positions: 3:E, 4:D? Then Y? But we have E at 2 and 3? So duplicate E? And D? But we need to end with Y? So position 5 is Y? So ""REEDY"" is R E E D Y? So position 3 is E? Position 4 is D? \n\nBut we don\'t know if E is duplicated? \n\nBut we have ""REEDY"" as a candidate? \n\nBut we have to avoid? Because we have eliminated? No? \n\nBut let\'s see: ""REEDY"" uses E and D? E is known? D is new? \n\nBut we are testing position 3 and 4? \n\nBut we have multiple candidates? \n\nGiven the feedback, we know Y is at the end? So the word is ""RE _ _ Y"". \n\nWe have to guess? \n\nBut we have 3 guesses left? So we can try? \n\nI think ""REBUY"" is a reasonable guess? \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback from guess 3: Y is at position 5? So we are sure? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""REBUY"". \n\nBut wait? Is there a word ""REBUS""? But S is eliminated? So no? \n\nAnother word: ""REBEL""? But L? Eliminated? And E? Duplicate? \n\n""REBAR""? A? Eliminated? \n\nSo ""REBUY"" it is? \n\nBut let\'s confirm: ""REBUY"" is a valid word? Yes? \n\nSo guess: ""REBUY""\n\n<guess>rebuy</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\n- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  \n  - R(✓): Correct letter in position 1.  \n  - A(x), I(x), S(x): A, I, S are **not** in the word.  \n  - E(-): E is in the word but **not** in position 5.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""retch""**  \n  - R(✓): Correct letter in position 1 (confirmed).  \n  - E(✓): Correct letter in position 2 (new confirmation).  \n  - T(x), C(x), H(x): T, C, H are **not** in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 3: ""reply""**  \n  - R(✓): Correct letter in position 1 (redundant).  \n  - E(✓): Correct letter in position 2 (redundant).  \n  - P(x), L(x): P and L are **not** in the word.  \n  - Y(✓): Correct letter in position 5 (new confirmation).  \n\n### Key Deductions\n1. **Confirmed positions**:  \n   - Position 1: **R**  \n   - Position 2: **E**  \n   - Position 5: **Y**  \n   - The word pattern is **R E _ _ Y**.  \n\n2. **Eliminated letters**:  \n   - A, I, S, T, C, H, P, L (cannot appear anywhere).  \n\n3. **Remaining unknown**:  \n   - Positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters **not** eliminated.  \n   - Valid letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  \n   - No duplicates confirmed yet, but possible (e.g., double E or other letters).  \n\n4. **Possible words**:  \n   - Must be a valid English word matching **R E _ _ Y**.  \n   - Common options:  \n     - **REBUY** (meaning: to buy again) → Tests B (pos 3) and U (pos 4).  \n     - **REKEY** (meaning: to reprogram a key) → Tests K (pos 3) and E (pos 4; tests for E duplication).  \n     - **REFRY** (meaning: to fry again) → Tests F (pos 3) and R (pos 4; tests for R duplication).  \n   - **REBUY** is prioritized:  \n     - Uses distinct new letters (B and U) to maximize information.  \n     - Avoids duplicates, simplifying feedback.  \n     - Common and valid 5-letter word.  \n\n### Next Guess: ""REBUY""\n- Tests **B** in position 3 and **U** in position 4.  \n- If B or U are correct, feedback will reveal their positions/absence.  \n- If both are absent, we eliminate B/U and narrow options further.\n\n<guess>rebuy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: retch -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) T(x) C(x) H(x)\nGuess 3: reply -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) P(x) L(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: rebuy -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) B(x) U(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R(✓) at position 1: Correct
- A(x): Not in word
- I(x): Not in word
- S(x): Not in word
- E(-) at position 5: E is in word, but not at position 5

- R(✓) at position 1: Correct (redundant)
- E(✓) at position 2: Correct and in position 2
- T(x): Not in word
- C(x): Not in word
- H(x): Not in word

Guess 3: ""reply""
- R(✓) at position 1: Correct
- E(✓) at position 2: Correct
- P(x): Not in word
- L(x): Not in word
- Y(✓) at position 5: Correct and in position 5

Guess 4: ""rebuy""
- R(✓) at position 1: Correct (redundant)
- E(✓) at position 2: Correct (redundant)
- B(x) at position 3: Not in word
- U(x) at position 4: Not in word
- Y(✓) at position 5: Correct (redundant)

What we know:
- The word starts with ""RE"" and ends with ""Y"": pattern ""RE _ _ Y""
- Position 1: R (fixed)
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 5: Y (fixed)
- Eliminated letters: A, I, S, T, C, H, P, L, B, U (all marked 'x' in guesses)
- Therefore, the remaining letters for positions 3 and 4 are from: D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Z (and any other letter not eliminated; note that duplicates may be possible, but we have no indication yet)

Since we have positions 3 and 4 unknown and only two slots, and the word must be a valid English word with pattern ""RE??Y"", we need to find words that fit.

List of possible letters for positions 3 and 4 (avoiding eliminated ones): 
D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Z

Now, we need common English words that fit ""RE??Y"":

Common possibilities:
- ""READY"" - but A is eliminated? Yes, A is out (from guess 1). So no.
- ""REALY"" - not a word; ""RELAY"" exists but L and A eliminated? L and A both out? So no.
- ""REEDY"" - E is duplicated? Positions: R E E D Y? So position 3: E, position 4: D? But E is already at position 2? So we'd be testing if E is duplicated? And we haven't tested D? But ""REEDY"" is a valid word? Meaning full of reeds? Or weak?
- ""REKEY"": K and E? R E K E Y? So position 3: K, position 4: E? Again, duplicated E?
- ""REFRY"": F and R? R E F R Y? So duplicated R? Position 3: F, position 4: R?
- ""REDDY"": D doubled? R E D D Y? So duplicated D?
- ""REWAX"": W and A? A eliminated? No.
- ""REZON"": not ending with Y.

So what's left?

Actually, ""REEDY"" (R E E D Y) avoids all eliminated letters? Let's check:
- E? We know E is in the word, but we don't know if duplicated? So E is allowed if duplicated? 
- D? Not eliminated? 
- Eliminated letters: A,I,S,T,C,H,P,L,B,U? So D is allowed? Yes.

Similarly, ""REKEY"" (R E K E Y): K not eliminated? And E? Okay? 

""REFRY"" (R E F R Y): F not eliminated? R duplicated? But R is already used? We can have duplication? 

Possible words:
- ""REEDY"" 
- ""REKEY"" 
- ""REFRY"" 
- ""REDDY"" 
- ""REWKY""? Not a word? 

Other less common: ""REJGY""? No?

""REMGY""? No?

""REVVY""? Not word.

So we have a few candidates? And we have to guess one? 

We have used 4 guesses? So 2 left? We can try? 

Now, we need to select one that maximizes information? But note that we only have two positions? So if we guess the right word? We win? 

But if we guess wrong? We have one last chance? 

So perhaps list the possible words based on commonality? 

""REEDY"" is more common than others? 

""REFRY"" is less common? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests for duplication? For example, if we guess ""REEDY"", we test:
- Position 3: E? If ✓, then E is duplicated and at position 3? But if not? Then it might be not duplicated? Or duplicated but wrong position? But we are putting E at position 3? If the secret word has E at position 3? Then ✓? If not? But E is in the word (already at position 2), so if duplicated at position 3? Or not? If no duplication? Then position 3 E would be not present? So x? 

Similarly, D position 4? 

But we can get three outcomes:

If we guess ""REEDY"" and the secret word is ""REEDY"", we win? If not? Then:

- If position 3 gets x? Then E is not duplicated? So E only at position 2? Then position 3 cannot be E? 
- Similarly, D? 

But since there are only two positions? We have limited choices? 

Let me count the candidate words: ""REEDY"", ""REKEY"", ""REFRY"", ""REDDY"". Four possibilities? 

But we have two guesses? So we can choose? 

To distinguish? If we choose ""REEDY"" and it's wrong? Then from feedback:
- If position 3 is E? We get either ✓ or x? 
  - If ✓, then we know E is at position 3? Then the word is ""RE? E Y""? But we have position 4? Then we need to ? But we have only one guess left? 
  - Actually, if ""REEDY"" is not correct? And position 3 is E? But we get ✓ for E? Then position 4 gets feedback: D? If correct ✓? Then we win? Otherwise? If D is not correct? Then x? And we know D is not in position 4? But D might be not in word? Then in next guess? 

But this is messy? 

Alternatively, guess a word that includes two new of the least common letters? But we don't care? 

Since we have so few options? Let's guess ""REEDY""? Because if E is duplicated? It's likely? Or not? We don't know? 

But ""REEDY"" is a valid word? 

Also, note that in ""raise"" the E was misplaced? But it was at position 5? And now we know E at position 2? So no direct clue for duplication. 

But to decide? Let me choose ""REEDY""? And see? 

But we have another candidate: what about ""ROSEY""? But O and S? S eliminated? No. 

Actually, ""ROSEY"" is not allowed? 

Another word: ""REFIT""? T eliminated? No. 

So only the ones I listed. 

We can guess ""REKEY"" to test K and E duplication? 

But I think ""REEDY"" is a reasonable choice? 

Perhaps think of the word that is most likely? 

But I recall that from start, the word had E? And E was not at position 5? Now we have it at 2? And Y at 5? Common such words are ""READY"" but A gone? ""RELAY"" gone? ""REPLY"" we tried? And P,L gone? 

So ""REEDY"" is possible? 

Also, ""REDDY"" with D? But ""REDDY"" is a surname? Or a variant of ""ready""? But accepted in word games? 

Let's look for another option? What about ""REWON""? Ends with N? No. 

""REBOY""? Not word? 

""REGAY""? Not word? 

So I guess ""REEDY"" is the best. 

Therefore, guess: ""reedy""

### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  
  - R(✓): Position 1 confirmed (R is fixed).  
  - A(x), I(x), S(x): A, I, S eliminated (not in word).  
  - E(-): E present but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""retch""**  
  - R(✓): Position 1 redundant.  
  - E(✓): Position 2 confirmed (E fixed).  
  - T(x), C(x), H(x): T, C, H eliminated.  

- **Guess 3: ""reply""**  
  - R(✓), E(✓): Positions 1–2 redundant.  
  - P(x), L(x): P, L eliminated.  
  - Y(✓): Position 5 confirmed (Y fixed).  

- **Guess 4: ""rebuy""**  
  - R(✓), E(✓), Y(✓): Positions 1, 2, 5 redundant.  
  - B(x), U(x): B, U eliminated.  

### Key Deductions
1. **Confirmed pattern**: **R E _ _ Y** (positions 1, 2, 5 fixed).  
2. **Eliminated letters**: A, I, S, T, C, H, P, L, B, U (not in word).  
3. **Unknown positions**:  
   - Position 3 and 4 must be filled with letters **not** eliminated.  
   - Valid letters: D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
4. **Possible words**:  
   - Must be valid English words matching ""R E _ _ Y"".  
   - Common options:  
     - **REEDY** (with E duplication; meaning overgrown with reeds).  
     - **REKEY** (with E duplication; meaning to reprogram keys).  
     - **REFRY** (with R duplication; meaning to fry again).  
     - **REDDY** (with D duplication; variant of ""ready"").  
   - **REEDY** is prioritized for next guess:  
     - Tests for **E duplication** (since E is at position 2 and now at position 3).  
     - Tests **D** (new letter) in position 4.  
     - Common word that fits pattern.  

### Reasoning for ""REEDY""
- If **E is duplicated**, position 3 will be ✓, and position 4 (D) provides new info.  
- If **E not duplicated**, position 3 E will be x (eliminating duplication), and D at position 4 tests a new consonant.  
- Eliminates one of the few remaining candidates efficiently (only 1–2 guesses left).

<guess>reedy</guess>",reedy,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R(✓) at position 1: Correct
- A(x): Not in word
- I(x): Not in word
- S(x): Not in word
- E(-) at position 5: E is in word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""retch""
- R(✓) at position 1: Correct (redundant)
- E(✓) at position 2: Correct and in position 2
- T(x): Not in word
- C(x): Not in word
- H(x): Not in word

Guess 3: ""reply""
- R(✓) at position 1: Correct
- E(✓) at position 2: Correct
- P(x): Not in word
- L(x): Not in word
- Y(✓) at position 5: Correct and in position 5

Guess 4: ""rebuy""
- R(✓) at position 1: Correct (redundant)
- E(✓) at position 2: Correct (redundant)
- B(x) at position 3: Not in word
- U(x) at position 4: Not in word
- Y(✓) at position 5: Correct (redundant)

What we know:
- The word starts with ""RE"" and ends with ""Y"": pattern ""RE _ _ Y""
- Position 1: R (fixed)
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 5: Y (fixed)
- Eliminated letters: A, I, S, T, C, H, P, L, B, U (all marked 'x' in guesses)
- Therefore, the remaining letters for positions 3 and 4 are from: D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Z (and any other letter not eliminated; note that duplicates may be possible, but we have no indication yet)

Since we have positions 3 and 4 unknown and only two slots, and the word must be a valid English word with pattern ""RE??Y"", we need to find words that fit.

List of possible letters for positions 3 and 4 (avoiding eliminated ones): 
D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Z

Now, we need common English words that fit ""RE??Y"":

Common possibilities:
- ""READY"" - but A is eliminated? Yes, A is out (from guess 1). So no.
- ""REALY"" - not a word; ""RELAY"" exists but L and A eliminated? L and A both out? So no.
- ""REEDY"" - E is duplicated? Positions: R E E D Y? So position 3: E, position 4: D? But E is already at position 2? So we'd be testing if E is duplicated? And we haven't tested D? But ""REEDY"" is a valid word? Meaning full of reeds? Or weak?
- ""REKEY"": K and E? R E K E Y? So position 3: K, position 4: E? Again, duplicated E?
- ""REFRY"": F and R? R E F R Y? So duplicated R? Position 3: F, position 4: R?
- ""REDDY"": D doubled? R E D D Y? So duplicated D?
- ""REWAX"": W and A? A eliminated? No.
- ""REZON"": not ending with Y.

So what's left?

Actually, ""REEDY"" (R E E D Y) avoids all eliminated letters? Let's check:
- E? We know E is in the word, but we don't know if duplicated? So E is allowed if duplicated? 
- D? Not eliminated? 
- Eliminated letters: A,I,S,T,C,H,P,L,B,U? So D is allowed? Yes.

Similarly, ""REKEY"" (R E K E Y): K not eliminated? And E? Okay? 

""REFRY"" (R E F R Y): F not eliminated? R duplicated? But R is already used? We can have duplication? 

Possible words:
- ""REEDY"" 
- ""REKEY"" 
- ""REFRY"" 
- ""REDDY"" 
- ""REWKY""? Not a word? 

Other less common: ""REJGY""? No?

""REMGY""? No?

""REVVY""? Not word.

So we have a few candidates? And we have to guess one? 

We have used 4 guesses? So 2 left? We can try? 

Now, we need to select one that maximizes information? But note that we only have two positions? So if we guess the right word? We win? 

But if we guess wrong? We have one last chance? 

So perhaps list the possible words based on commonality? 

""REEDY"" is more common than others? 

""REFRY"" is less common? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests for duplication? For example, if we guess ""REEDY"", we test:
- Position 3: E? If ✓, then E is duplicated and at position 3? But if not? Then it might be not duplicated? Or duplicated but wrong position? But we are putting E at position 3? If the secret word has E at position 3? Then ✓? If not? But E is in the word (already at position 2), so if duplicated at position 3? Or not? If no duplication? Then position 3 E would be not present? So x? 

Similarly, D position 4? 

But we can get three outcomes:

If we guess ""REEDY"" and the secret word is ""REEDY"", we win? If not? Then:

- If position 3 gets x? Then E is not duplicated? So E only at position 2? Then position 3 cannot be E? 
- Similarly, D? 

But since there are only two positions? We have limited choices? 

Let me count the candidate words: ""REEDY"", ""REKEY"", ""REFRY"", ""REDDY"". Four possibilities? 

But we have two guesses? So we can choose? 

To distinguish? If we choose ""REEDY"" and it's wrong? Then from feedback:
- If position 3 is E? We get either ✓ or x? 
  - If ✓, then we know E is at position 3? Then the word is ""RE? E Y""? But we have position 4? Then we need to ? But we have only one guess left? 
  - Actually, if ""REEDY"" is not correct? And position 3 is E? But we get ✓ for E? Then position 4 gets feedback: D? If correct ✓? Then we win? Otherwise? If D is not correct? Then x? And we know D is not in position 4? But D might be not in word? Then in next guess? 

But this is messy? 

Alternatively, guess a word that includes two new of the least common letters? But we don't care? 

Since we have so few options? Let's guess ""REEDY""? Because if E is duplicated? It's likely? Or not? We don't know? 

But ""REEDY"" is a valid word? 

Also, note that in ""raise"" the E was misplaced? But it was at position 5? And now we know E at position 2? So no direct clue for duplication. 

But to decide? Let me choose ""REEDY""? And see? 

But we have another candidate: what about ""ROSEY""? But O and S? S eliminated? No.
