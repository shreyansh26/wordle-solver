We are starting the game. We have to guess a 5-letter word.
 Since it's the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback, so we should choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Let me choose a word that has letters that are frequently used in English: for example, ""CRATE"".

 Why ""CRATE""?
 - It has five distinct letters: C, R, A, T, E.
 - The letters are common: A, E, and R are very common, and C and T are also common.
 - This word uses two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 However, note that we can use any valid English word. Let's consider ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". 
 But I'll go with ""CRATE"" for the first guess.

 Let me output in the required format.

I am making my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I'll choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information gathering. The word ""CRATE"" is a strong starting choice because:

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crate"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

So we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.
- The letters C, R, T are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the word pattern is: _ _ A _ E

We need to make a second guess that is a valid 5-letter English word, and we should avoid using C, R, T.

We also know that the word must have A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.

Let's think of words that fit: _ _ A _ E

We can try to use other common letters to test the remaining positions.

Possible letters for the first, second, and fourth positions (avoiding C, R, T).

Common consonants: S, L, N, D, G, B, P, M, etc.
Common vowels: O, I, U (but we already have A and E, so maybe we don't need more vowels? But we can use them if they fit).

We should also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But in the feedback, we didn't see any indication of repetition, but it's possible. However, since we are avoiding C, R, T, and we have two positions to fill (1,2,4) and one of them might be a vowel.

Let me try to list some words that end with ""A_E"" (so 3rd letter A, 5th letter E) and avoid C, R, T.

Examples:
- SHADE: S H A D E -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E -> but we have to check if D is allowed? We haven't eliminated D.
- SHAME: S H A M E
- SHAPE: S H A P E
- SLADE: but L is allowed? Yes, we haven't eliminated L.
- BLADE: B L A D E -> but B and L are not eliminated.

But note: we must avoid using C, R, T.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me think of words that have distinct letters and cover common ones.

Another idea: since we know two letters (A and E) and their positions, we can focus on the unknown positions (1,2,4) and use common letters.

We can try ""SHADE"": 
- S, H, D are new letters.

But let me check if there are better options.

""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B, L, M are new.

""PLANE"": but we cannot use R? Wait, PLANE has R? No, PLANE: P, L, A, N, E -> no R? Wait, PLANE is P-L-A-N-E. So no R, and we avoid C, R, T? We avoid R, so we cannot use R. But PLANE does not have R. It has P, L, A, N, E. So that's okay? But we have to check: we haven't eliminated P, L, N.

But note: the feedback for the first guess said R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. But PLANE doesn't have R, so it's okay.

However, we also know that the 3rd letter is A and 5th is E, so PLANE fits: P L A N E -> 3rd is A, 5th is E.

But we must avoid using the letters that are not in the word: C, R, T. So PLANE is acceptable.

But we also want to test more common letters. Let me see the frequency.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has S, because S is very common.

Another word: ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> but we avoid R? No R. But we have to avoid C, R, T. SPADE has S, P, A, D, E. So that's okay.

But note: we already know A and E are in the word and in the correct positions, so in our guess, we can keep A and E in the same positions to confirm (but they are already confirmed) and test new letters in the other positions.

So for the second guess, we can choose a word that has A in the 3rd and E in the 5th, and uses new letters for positions 1,2,4.

We should avoid using C, R, T.

Let me choose a word that uses common letters that we haven't tried: for example, S, L, N, D, P, M, B, etc.

I think ""SHADE"" is a good candidate: 
- S, H, D are new.

But let me see if there is a word that covers more common letters.

""SLATE"": but we cannot use T because T was marked as not in the word in the first guess. So T is not allowed. Therefore, we cannot use T.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, T.

So ""SLATE"" is invalid because it has T.

""PLANE"": P, L, A, N, E -> no T, no R, no C. So that's acceptable.

""PLANE"" uses P, L, N. These are common.

Another option: ""BLAME"": B, L, A, M, E.

We can also consider ""SHAME"": S, H, A, M, E.

I think I'll go with ""PLANE"" because it uses P, L, N which are common and we haven't tested them.

But note: we are not sure if the word has P, L, or N. We are testing them.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has S, because S is the most common letter. So ""SHADE"" or ""SHAME"".

But ""SHADE"" has D, which is less common than N? Or maybe not.

Let me check: in English, the frequency of letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, ... but we avoid R, T, C. So after A and E, the next are I, O, N, S, L.

So we should try to include N, S, L, O, I.

But we have two positions to test (1,2,4) and we can only test three new letters (since we are keeping A and E).

So we can test three new letters.

I think ""PLANE"" is a good choice: it has P, L, N.

But S is more common than P. So maybe ""SLANE""? That's not a word.

""SHINE"": but 3rd letter is I, not A. We must have A in the 3rd and E in the 5th.

So we need a word that has A in the 3rd and E in the 5th.

Words: 
- ...A..E

So the pattern is: ? ? A ? E

We can use: 
- SHAPE: S H A P E -> S, H, P
- SHAME: S H A M E -> S, H, M
- SHADE: S H A D E -> S, H, D
- BLAME: B L A M E -> B, L, M
- PLANE: P L A N E -> P, L, N
- FLAME: F L A M E -> F, L, M (but F is less common)

I think ""SHAME"" is a good option because it has S (very common) and M and H.

But let me see: we already have A and E, so we are testing S, H, M.

Alternatively, ""PLANE"" tests P, L, N.

I think both are reasonable. I'll go with ""SHAME"" because S is the most common consonant.

So my second guess: SHAME

But let me confirm: 
- S: new
- H: new
- A: already known, correct position
- M: new
- E: already known, correct position

And we avoid C, R, T.

So <guess>shame</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C, R, and T are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A is in the correct 3rd position (marked ""✓"").
- E is in the correct 5th position (marked ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A _ E`, and it **cannot** contain C, R, or T.

For the second guess:
- I need to prioritize testing new common letters (avoiding C, R, T) in positions 1, 2, and 4.
- I should keep A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position to maintain known correct placements.
- Ideal letters to test include high-frequency consonants like S, L, N, M, or H, as they appear often in 5-letter words.

A strong candidate is **""SHAME""**:
- It tests S (position 1), H (position 2), and M (position 4)—all new, common letters not yet evaluated.
- It preserves A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, T).

This guess maximizes information by covering three new high-frequency letters while building on the confirmed pattern.

<guess>shame</guess>",shame,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crate"":

- R: x (not in the word)

 - It has five distinct letters: C, R, A, T, E.
 - The letters are common: A, E, and R are very common, and C and T are also common.
 - This word uses two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 However, note that we can use any valid English word. Let's consider ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". 
 But I'll go with ""CRATE"" for the first guess.

 Let me output in the required format.I am making my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I'll choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information gathering. The word ""CRATE"" is a strong starting choice because:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

So we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.
- The letters C, R, T are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the word pattern is: _ _ A _ E

We need to make a second guess that is a valid 5-letter English word, and we should avoid using C, R, T.

We also know that the word must have A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.

Let's think of words that fit: _ _ A _ E

We can try to use other common letters to test the remaining positions.

Possible letters for the first, second, and fourth positions (avoiding C, R, T).

Common consonants: S, L, N, D, G, B, P, M, etc.
Common vowels: O, I, U (but we already have A and E, so maybe we don't need more vowels? But we can use them if they fit).

We should also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But in the feedback, we didn't see any indication of repetition, but it's possible. However, since we are avoiding C, R, T, and we have two positions to fill (1,2,4) and one of them might be a vowel.

Let me try to list some words that end with ""A_E"" (so 3rd letter A, 5th letter E) and avoid C, R, T.

Examples:
- SHADE: S H A D E -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E -> but we have to check if D is allowed? We haven't eliminated D.
- SHAME: S H A M E
- SHAPE: S H A P E
- SLADE: but L is allowed? Yes, we haven't eliminated L.
- BLADE: B L A D E -> but B and L are not eliminated.

But note: we must avoid using C, R, T.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me think of words that have distinct letters and cover common ones.

Another idea: since we know two letters (A and E) and their positions, we can focus on the unknown positions (1,2,4) and use common letters.

We can try ""SHADE"": 
- S, H, D are new letters.

But let me check if there are better options.

""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B, L, M are new.

""PLANE"": but we cannot use R? Wait, PLANE has R? No, PLANE: P, L, A, N, E -> no R? Wait, PLANE is P-L-A-N-E. So no R, and we avoid C, R, T? We avoid R, so we cannot use R. But PLANE does not have R. It has P, L, A, N, E. So that's okay? But we have to check: we haven't eliminated P, L, N.

But note: the feedback for the first guess said R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. But PLANE doesn't have R, so it's okay.

However, we also know that the 3rd letter is A and 5th is E, so PLANE fits: P L A N E -> 3rd is A, 5th is E.

But we must avoid using the letters that are not in the word: C, R, T. So PLANE is acceptable.

But we also want to test more common letters. Let me see the frequency.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has S, because S is very common.

Another word: ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> but we avoid R? No R. But we have to avoid C, R, T. SPADE has S, P, A, D, E. So that's okay.

But note: we already know A and E are in the word and in the correct positions, so in our guess, we can keep A and E in the same positions to confirm (but they are already confirmed) and test new letters in the other positions.

So for the second guess, we can choose a word that has A in the 3rd and E in the 5th, and uses new letters for positions 1,2,4.

We should avoid using C, R, T.

Let me choose a word that uses common letters that we haven't tried: for example, S, L, N, D, P, M, B, etc.

I think ""SHADE"" is a good candidate: 
- S, H, D are new.

But let me see if there is a word that covers more common letters.

""SLATE"": but we cannot use T because T was marked as not in the word in the first guess. So T is not allowed. Therefore, we cannot use T.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, T.

So ""SLATE"" is invalid because it has T.

""PLANE"": P, L, A, N, E -> no T, no R, no C. So that's acceptable.

""PLANE"" uses P, L, N. These are common.

Another option: ""BLAME"": B, L, A, M, E.

We can also consider ""SHAME"": S, H, A, M, E.

I think I'll go with ""PLANE"" because it uses P, L, N which are common and we haven't tested them.

But note: we are not sure if the word has P, L, or N. We are testing them.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has S, because S is the most common letter. So ""SHADE"" or ""SHAME"".

But ""SHADE"" has D, which is less common than N? Or maybe not.

Let me check: in English, the frequency of letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, ... but we avoid R, T, C. So after A and E, the next are I, O, N, S, L.

So we should try to include N, S, L, O, I.

But we have two positions to test (1,2,4) and we can only test three new letters (since we are keeping A and E).

So we can test three new letters.

I think ""PLANE"" is a good choice: it has P, L, N.

But S is more common than P. So maybe ""SLANE""? That's not a word.

""SHINE"": but 3rd letter is I, not A. We must have A in the 3rd and E in the 5th.

So we need a word that has A in the 3rd and E in the 5th.

Words: 
- ...A..E

So the pattern is: ? ? A ? E

We can use: 
- SHAPE: S H A P E -> S, H, P
- SHAME: S H A M E -> S, H, M
- SHADE: S H A D E -> S, H, D
- BLAME: B L A M E -> B, L, M
- PLANE: P L A N E -> P, L, N
- FLAME: F L A M E -> F, L, M (but F is less common)

I think ""SHAME"" is a good option because it has S (very common) and M and H.

But let me see: we already have A and E, so we are testing S, H, M.

Alternatively, ""PLANE"" tests P, L, N.

I think both are reasonable. I'll go with ""SHAME"" because S is the most common consonant.

So my second guess: SHAME

But let me confirm: 
- S: new
- H: new
- A: already known, correct position
- M: new
- E: already known, correct position

And we avoid C, R, T.

So <guess>shame</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C, R, and T are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A is in the correct 3rd position (marked ""✓"").
- E is in the correct 5th position (marked ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A _ E`, and it **cannot** contain C, R, or T.

For the second guess:
- I need to prioritize testing new common letters (avoiding C, R, T) in positions 1, 2, and 4.
- I should keep A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position to maintain known correct placements.
- Ideal letters to test include high-frequency consonants like S, L, N, M, or H, as they appear often in 5-letter words.

A strong candidate is **""SHAME""**:
- It tests S (position 1), H (position 2), and M (position 4)—all new, common letters not yet evaluated.
- It preserves A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, T).

This guess maximizes information by covering three new high-frequency letters while building on the confirmed pattern.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
- This means:
  - The letters C, R, T are not in the word at all.
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E

Guess 2: ""shame"" -> Feedback: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)
- Interpretation:
  - S is correct and in the right position (1st).
  - H is correct and in the right position (2nd).
  - A is correct (3rd) as before.
  - M is not in the word (x).
  - E is correct (5th) as before.
- So now we know:
  - The first five letters are: S, H, A, ?, E
  - The word is SHA?E
  - M is not in the word.

Additionally, from the first guess, we know C, R, T are not in the word.

So the secret word is SHA?E, where the 4th letter is missing. We need to find a 5-letter word that fits SHA?E and the missing letter cannot be M (since M is not in the word) and cannot be C, R, T.

What letters are possible for the 4th position?
- Any letter except those we've eliminated: C, R, T, M, and also avoiding letters already placed correctly (unless we suspect duplication, but given the feedback, we haven't seen repeated letters yet). Since A and E are already used and in their positions, and S and H are fixed, the 4th letter must be a new letter not yet tested.

We should consider common English letters that can fit in the 4th position to form a valid word.

Possible words with the pattern SHA_E:
- SHADE
- SHAKE
- SHALE
- SHAPE
- SHARE
- SHAVE
- SHAWL

But we must eliminate forbidden letters:
- SHADE: D is not forbidden (not in C, R, T, M)
- SHAKE: K is not forbidden
- SHALE: L is not forbidden
- SHAPE: P is not forbidden
- SHARE: R is forbidden (from Guess 1), so invalid
- SHAVE: V is not forbidden
- SHAWL: W is not forbidden, and L is allowed

Also note the feedback: M is not in the word, so M is eliminated, which is good because SHAME is already guessed and eliminated.

Now, we need to pick one of these as a guess. But note: we have only one letter to determine (the 4th), so we could guess any of these. However, we want to maximize the chance of getting it right or narrow down possibilities.

But we have 6 guesses total, and this is the third guess. If we guess wrong, we can get more feedback, so we can choose a word that tests a common letter to help with future guesses.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that might be the answer, but we have multiple options. Let me list the possibilities again:

Possible words (from common words):
- shade
- shake
- shale
- shape
- shave
- shawl

We haven't tested letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z (and avoiding C,R,T,M)

But note: in ""shame"", we tested M and found it's not in the word. So we can avoid M.

Now, among the possible words:
- shade: uses D
- shake: uses K
- shale: uses L
- shape: uses P
- shave: uses V
- shawl: uses W and L

We should choose a word that uses a common letter so that if it's wrong, we eliminate a common letter.

Alternatively, we can choose the most common word or one that covers frequent letters.

However, we have to guess one. Let's see the probability or commonality.

We also know that from the first guess, we tested A and E which are vowels, and now we have consonants in the 4th position.

But without more information, we can pick, say, ""SHADE"" because D is common.

But note: we want to avoid guessing a word that might contain eliminated letters? None of these have C,R,T,M.

Another idea: we can use a word that uses letters we haven't tested, but since we only have one position, it doesn't matter much.

But observe: if we guess SHADE and it's wrong, then D is eliminated, and we can proceed.

Similarly, if we guess SHAKE, K is eliminated if wrong.

Since we have multiple possibilities, we could also choose a word that has a letter that appears in multiple options? But each word has a unique letter for the 4th position in this set, except SHAWL has W and L? Wait, SHAWL is S-H-A-W-L, so the 4th letter is W and 5th is L? No, wait the pattern is 4th letter: for SHADE: D; SHAKE: K; SHALE: L; SHAPE: P; SHAVE: V; SHAWL: W.

But note: SHAWL has L as the 5th letter? No, SHAWL is spelled S-H-A-W-L, so positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:W, 5:L. But we know the 5th letter must be E, so SHAWL is not possible! Because it ends with L, but we require E at the end.

I made a mistake. The word must end with E: pattern is SHA?E, so the 5th letter is E.

Therefore, re-examining:
- SHADE: S-H-A-D-E -> yes, 4th is D
- SHAKE: S-H-A-K-E -> yes
- SHALE: S-H-A-L-E -> yes? Wait, SHALE: S-H-A-L-E -> 4th letter L, 5th E? No, L is the 4th letter, E is 5th. So it fits.
  - SHALE is a word: a type of rock.
- SHAPE: S-H-A-P-E -> 4th P, 5th E
- SHARE: not possible due to R, and also S-H-A-R-E, but R is forbidden.
- SHAVE: S-H-A-V-E -> 4th V
- SHAWL: S-H-A-W-L -> but L is the 5th letter, not E, so it doesn't fit. Therefore, SHAWL is invalid.

What about other words? Like SHINE? No, because 3rd letter must be A, not I.

We can consider less common words, but let's stick with common ones.

Possible common words: SHADE, SHAKE, SHALE, SHAPE, SHAVE, and also SHIRE? But SHIRE has R which is forbidden.

SHOTE? Not a common word, and T is eliminated.

So the most common ones are: SHADE, SHAKE, SHAPE, and SHAVE.

Now SHALE: it's valid and common enough.

We have D, K, L, P, V as the options for the 4th letter.

We need to guess one. Since we don't have any additional information, we should pick the most frequent letter or word.

But we might also consider that from the first guess, we had A and E correct, and S and H correct, meaning the word is likely common.

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests a letter that, if eliminated, might help with other possibilities? But they are all different.

Let's think tactically: we have 4 guesses left and only 5-6 possibilities? Actually, that's manageable.

We can guess ""SHADE"" first because:
- D is a very common letter.

If we guess ""SHADE"" and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback:
- If D is wrong, then we know the 4th letter is not D.
- The remaining options: SHAKE (K), SHALE (L), SHAPE (P), SHAVE (V)

Then we can pick another.

But to minimize worst-case, we might pick the letter that appears in the most possibilities, but each possibility has a unique letter.

Alternatively, we can pick a word that is most common. According to word lists, SHAPE, SHADE, SHAKE are all common.

Let me check frequencies of the letters:
- K is less common than D or L? Actually, D, L are more common than K, P, V.

But without specific data, I'll go with ""SHADE"" because it's straightforward.

But note: we haven't tested L. If SHADE is wrong, we still have SHALE with L, which is common.

However, to confirm: SHALE ends with E? SHALE is S-H-A-L-E? Yes, and E is the 5th letter.

Similarly, SHAVE: S-H-A-V-E.

I think I'll guess ""SHAPE"" because P is also common, but D is more common in 4th position? Not necessarily.

Given that L appears twice in the possible words? No, only SHALE has L. But L is a letter that might be in the word in other positions? But here we are only concerned with the 4th position.

Since we have to choose, let's alphabetically? Or randomly? Better to pick one.

I think ""shade"" is a good guess because it uses D, which we haven't tested, and it's a common word.

But to be systematic: the letter E is in the word (5th) and A is 3rd, S is 1st, H is 2nd. We know the word starts with SHA and ends with E. Common words: shade, shape, shake, shave, shale. Among these, shade and shake are very common words.

But let me count the possibilities: 5.

We can also consider if there are words with double letters, but we don't have evidence. For example, if the word was SHADE, then D would be the only unknown.

But given the feedback has been specific about positions, and no '-' for other positions, so double letters might not be present? Because in ""shame"", H and S were both correct, so no duplicate issues.

I think ""shade"" is fine.

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we can't because all known letters are fixed except one.

So I'll go with ""SHADE"".

But wait, what if the word is ""SHALE""? Then we guess SHADE, if it returns the 4th letter as 'x', then we know D is not in it, so we can try SHALE next.

But similarly, if we guess SHALE first, same thing.

To prioritize commonality: according to some sources, SHADE is the most common of these words? But SHAPE is also common.

Actually, in Wordle solutions, SHADE, SHARE, SHAPE are common words, but SHARE has R which is eliminated. So SHADE and SHAPE are both possible.

Perhaps ""SHAKE"" is also common.

But since we don't have more information, I'll choose ""SHADE"".

So the word to guess: SHADE

In the response format, we should output.

But note: the previous feedback didn't have any '-' symbols, meaning no misplaced letters, so the word must exactly match SHA?E and only the ? is unknown, and no other letters. So we are confident.

Therefore, we can make the guess SHADE.
</think>
The feedback from the previous guesses reveals the following:

1. **Guess 1: ""crate"" → C(x), R(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)**:  
   - Eliminated letters: C, R, T (not in the word).  
   - Confirmed positions: A (3rd), E (5th).  
   - Pattern: `_ _ A _ E`.  

2. **Guess 2: ""shame"" → S(✓), H(✓), A(✓), M(x), E(✓)**:  
   - Confirmed positions: S (1st), H (2nd), A (3rd), E (5th).  
   - Eliminated letter: M (not in the word).  
   - Pattern: `S H A _ E`.  

The secret word is `S H A _ E`, where the fourth letter must be a valid English letter—avoiding C, R, T (from Guess 1) and M (from Guess 2)—that forms a real 5-letter word. Possible words fitting this pattern and constraints include:  
- **SHADE** (D), **SHAKE** (K), **SHALE** (L), **SHAPE** (P), or **SHAVE** (V).  

With no prior information about the fourth letter, I prioritize **SHADE** as the next guess because:  
- D is a high-frequency consonant in English, and ""SHADE"" is a common word.  
- If incorrect, the feedback on D will quickly narrow the options (to SHAKE, SHALE, SHAPE, or SHAVE) with three guesses remaining.  

<guess>shade</guess>",shade,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
- This means:
  - The letters C, R, T are not in the word at all.
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E

Guess 2: ""shame"" -> Feedback: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)
- Interpretation:
  - S is correct and in the right position (1st).
  - H is correct and in the right position (2nd).
  - A is correct (3rd) as before.
  - M is not in the word (x).
  - E is correct (5th) as before.
- So now we know:
  - The first five letters are: S, H, A, ?, E
  - The word is SHA?E
  - M is not in the word.

Additionally, from the first guess, we know C, R, T are not in the word.

So the secret word is SHA?E, where the 4th letter is missing. We need to find a 5-letter word that fits SHA?E and the missing letter cannot be M (since M is not in the word) and cannot be C, R, T.

What letters are possible for the 4th position?
- Any letter except those we've eliminated: C, R, T, M, and also avoiding letters already placed correctly (unless we suspect duplication, but given the feedback, we haven't seen repeated letters yet). Since A and E are already used and in their positions, and S and H are fixed, the 4th letter must be a new letter not yet tested.

We should consider common English letters that can fit in the 4th position to form a valid word.

Possible words with the pattern SHA_E:
- SHADE
- SHAKE
- SHALE
- SHAPE
- SHARE
- SHAVE
- SHAWL

But we must eliminate forbidden letters:
- SHADE: D is not forbidden (not in C, R, T, M)
- SHAKE: K is not forbidden
- SHALE: L is not forbidden
- SHAPE: P is not forbidden
- SHARE: R is forbidden (from Guess 1), so invalid
- SHAVE: V is not forbidden
- SHAWL: W is not forbidden, and L is allowed

Also note the feedback: M is not in the word, so M is eliminated, which is good because SHAME is already guessed and eliminated.

Now, we need to pick one of these as a guess. But note: we have only one letter to determine (the 4th), so we could guess any of these. However, we want to maximize the chance of getting it right or narrow down possibilities.

But we have 6 guesses total, and this is the third guess. If we guess wrong, we can get more feedback, so we can choose a word that tests a common letter to help with future guesses.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that might be the answer, but we have multiple options. Let me list the possibilities again:

Possible words (from common words):
- shade
- shake
- shale
- shape
- shave
- shawl

We haven't tested letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z (and avoiding C,R,T,M)

But note: in ""shame"", we tested M and found it's not in the word. So we can avoid M.

Now, among the possible words:
- shade: uses D
- shake: uses K
- shale: uses L
- shape: uses P
- shave: uses V
- shawl: uses W and L

We should choose a word that uses a common letter so that if it's wrong, we eliminate a common letter.

Alternatively, we can choose the most common word or one that covers frequent letters.

However, we have to guess one. Let's see the probability or commonality.

We also know that from the first guess, we tested A and E which are vowels, and now we have consonants in the 4th position.

But without more information, we can pick, say, ""SHADE"" because D is common.

But note: we want to avoid guessing a word that might contain eliminated letters? None of these have C,R,T,M.

Another idea: we can use a word that uses letters we haven't tested, but since we only have one position, it doesn't matter much.

But observe: if we guess SHADE and it's wrong, then D is eliminated, and we can proceed.

Similarly, if we guess SHAKE, K is eliminated if wrong.

Since we have multiple possibilities, we could also choose a word that has a letter that appears in multiple options? But each word has a unique letter for the 4th position in this set, except SHAWL has W and L? Wait, SHAWL is S-H-A-W-L, so the 4th letter is W and 5th is L? No, wait the pattern is 4th letter: for SHADE: D; SHAKE: K; SHALE: L; SHAPE: P; SHAVE: V; SHAWL: W.

But note: SHAWL has L as the 5th letter? No, SHAWL is spelled S-H-A-W-L, so positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:W, 5:L. But we know the 5th letter must be E, so SHAWL is not possible! Because it ends with L, but we require E at the end.

I made a mistake. The word must end with E: pattern is SHA?E, so the 5th letter is E.

Therefore, re-examining:
- SHADE: S-H-A-D-E -> yes, 4th is D
- SHAKE: S-H-A-K-E -> yes
- SHALE: S-H-A-L-E -> yes? Wait, SHALE: S-H-A-L-E -> 4th letter L, 5th E? No, L is the 4th letter, E is 5th. So it fits.
  - SHALE is a word: a type of rock.
- SHAPE: S-H-A-P-E -> 4th P, 5th E
- SHARE: not possible due to R, and also S-H-A-R-E, but R is forbidden.
- SHAVE: S-H-A-V-E -> 4th V
- SHAWL: S-H-A-W-L -> but L is the 5th letter, not E, so it doesn't fit. Therefore, SHAWL is invalid.

What about other words? Like SHINE? No, because 3rd letter must be A, not I.

We can consider less common words, but let's stick with common ones.

Possible common words: SHADE, SHAKE, SHALE, SHAPE, SHAVE, and also SHIRE? But SHIRE has R which is forbidden.

SHOTE? Not a common word, and T is eliminated.

So the most common ones are: SHADE, SHAKE, SHAPE, and SHAVE.

Now SHALE: it's valid and common enough.

We have D, K, L, P, V as the options for the 4th letter.

We need to guess one. Since we don't have any additional information, we should pick the most frequent letter or word.

But we might also consider that from the first guess, we had A and E correct, and S and H correct, meaning the word is likely common.

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests a letter that, if eliminated, might help with other possibilities? But they are all different.

Let's think tactically: we have 4 guesses left and only 5-6 possibilities? Actually, that's manageable.

We can guess ""SHADE"" first because:
- D is a very common letter.

If we guess ""SHADE"" and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback:
- If D is wrong, then we know the 4th letter is not D.
- The remaining options: SHAKE (K), SHALE (L), SHAPE (P), SHAVE (V)

Then we can pick another.

But to minimize worst-case, we might pick the letter that appears in the most possibilities, but each possibility has a unique letter.

Alternatively, we can pick a word that is most common. According to word lists, SHAPE, SHADE, SHAKE are all common.

Let me check frequencies of the letters:
- K is less common than D or L? Actually, D, L are more common than K, P, V.

But without specific data, I'll go with ""SHADE"" because it's straightforward.

But note: we haven't tested L. If SHADE is wrong, we still have SHALE with L, which is common.

However, to confirm: SHALE ends with E? SHALE is S-H-A-L-E? Yes, and E is the 5th letter.

Similarly, SHAVE: S-H-A-V-E.

I think I'll guess ""SHAPE"" because P is also common, but D is more common in 4th position? Not necessarily.

Given that L appears twice in the possible words? No, only SHALE has L. But L is a letter that might be in the word in other positions? But here we are only concerned with the 4th position.

Since we have to choose, let's alphabetically? Or randomly? Better to pick one.

I think ""shade"" is a good guess because it uses D, which we haven't tested, and it's a common word.

But to be systematic: the letter E is in the word (5th) and A is 3rd, S is 1st, H is 2nd. We know the word starts with SHA and ends with E. Common words: shade, shape, shake, shave, shale. Among these, shade and shake are very common words.

But let me count the possibilities: 5.

We can also consider if there are words with double letters, but we don't have evidence. For example, if the word was SHADE, then D would be the only unknown.

But given the feedback has been specific about positions, and no '-' for other positions, so double letters might not be present? Because in ""shame"", H and S were both correct, so no duplicate issues.

I think ""shade"" is fine.

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we can't because all known letters are fixed except one.

So I'll go with ""SHADE"".

But wait, what if the word is ""SHALE""? Then we guess SHADE, if it returns the 4th letter as 'x', then we know D is not in it, so we can try SHALE next.

But similarly, if we guess SHALE first, same thing.

To prioritize commonality: according to some sources, SHADE is the most common of these words? But SHAPE is also common.

Actually, in Wordle solutions, SHADE, SHARE, SHAPE are common words, but SHARE has R which is eliminated. So SHADE and SHAPE are both possible.

Perhaps ""SHAKE"" is also common.

But since we don't have more information, I'll choose ""SHADE"".

So the word to guess: SHADE

In the response format, we should output.

But note: the previous feedback didn't have any '-' symbols, meaning no misplaced letters, so the word must exactly match SHA?E and only the ? is unknown, and no other letters. So we are confident.

Therefore, we can make the guess SHADE.The feedback from the previous guesses reveals the following:

1. **Guess 1: ""crate"" → C(x), R(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)**:  
   - Eliminated letters: C, R, T (not in the word).  
   - Confirmed positions: A (3rd), E (5th).  
   - Pattern: `_ _ A _ E`.  

2. **Guess 2: ""shame"" → S(✓), H(✓), A(✓), M(x), E(✓)**:  
   - Confirmed positions: S (1st), H (2nd), A (3rd), E (5th).  
   - Eliminated letter: M (not in the word).  
   - Pattern: `S H A _ E`.  

The secret word is `S H A _ E`, where the fourth letter must be a valid English letter—avoiding C, R, T (from Guess 1) and M (from Guess 2)—that forms a real 5-letter word. Possible words fitting this pattern and constraints include:  
- **SHADE** (D), **SHAKE** (K), **SHALE** (L), **SHAPE** (P), or **SHAVE** (V).  

With no prior information about the fourth letter, I prioritize **SHADE** as the next guess because:  
- D is a high-frequency consonant in English, and ""SHADE"" is a common word.  
- If incorrect, the feedback on D will quickly narrow the options (to SHAKE, SHALE, SHAPE, or SHAVE) with three guesses remaining.",Guess 3: shade -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have to guess a 5-letter word.
 Since it's the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback, so we should choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Let me choose a word that has letters that are frequently used in English: for example, ""CRATE"".

 Why ""CRATE""?
 - It has five distinct letters: C, R, A, T, E.
 - The letters are common: A, E, and R are very common, and C and T are also common.
 - This word uses two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 However, note that we can use any valid English word. Let's consider ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". 
 But I'll go with ""CRATE"" for the first guess.

 Let me output in the required format.I am making my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I'll choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information gathering. The word ""CRATE"" is a strong starting choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, T).
- All five letters are distinct, allowing me to test more characters at once.
- These letters frequently appear in English 5-letter words.

<guess>crate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crate"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

So we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.
- The letters C, R, T are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the word pattern is: _ _ A _ E

We need to make a second guess that is a valid 5-letter English word, and we should avoid using C, R, T.

We also know that the word must have A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.

Let's think of words that fit: _ _ A _ E

We can try to use other common letters to test the remaining positions.

Possible letters for the first, second, and fourth positions (avoiding C, R, T).

Common consonants: S, L, N, D, G, B, P, M, etc.
Common vowels: O, I, U (but we already have A and E, so maybe we don't need more vowels? But we can use them if they fit).

We should also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But in the feedback, we didn't see any indication of repetition, but it's possible. However, since we are avoiding C, R, T, and we have two positions to fill (1,2,4) and one of them might be a vowel.

Let me try to list some words that end with ""A_E"" (so 3rd letter A, 5th letter E) and avoid C, R, T.

Examples:
- SHADE: S H A D E -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E -> but we have to check if D is allowed? We haven't eliminated D.
- SHAME: S H A M E
- SHAPE: S H A P E
- SLADE: but L is allowed? Yes, we haven't eliminated L.
- BLADE: B L A D E -> but B and L are not eliminated.

But note: we must avoid using C, R, T.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me think of words that have distinct letters and cover common ones.

Another idea: since we know two letters (A and E) and their positions, we can focus on the unknown positions (1,2,4) and use common letters.

We can try ""SHADE"": 
- S, H, D are new letters.

But let me check if there are better options.

""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B, L, M are new.

""PLANE"": but we cannot use R? Wait, PLANE has R? No, PLANE: P, L, A, N, E -> no R? Wait, PLANE is P-L-A-N-E. So no R, and we avoid C, R, T? We avoid R, so we cannot use R. But PLANE does not have R. It has P, L, A, N, E. So that's okay? But we have to check: we haven't eliminated P, L, N.

But note: the feedback for the first guess said R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. But PLANE doesn't have R, so it's okay.

However, we also know that the 3rd letter is A and 5th is E, so PLANE fits: P L A N E -> 3rd is A, 5th is E.

But we must avoid using the letters that are not in the word: C, R, T. So PLANE is acceptable.

But we also want to test more common letters. Let me see the frequency.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has S, because S is very common.

Another word: ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> but we avoid R? No R. But we have to avoid C, R, T. SPADE has S, P, A, D, E. So that's okay.

But note: we already know A and E are in the word and in the correct positions, so in our guess, we can keep A and E in the same positions to confirm (but they are already confirmed) and test new letters in the other positions.

So for the second guess, we can choose a word that has A in the 3rd and E in the 5th, and uses new letters for positions 1,2,4.

We should avoid using C, R, T.

Let me choose a word that uses common letters that we haven't tried: for example, S, L, N, D, P, M, B, etc.

I think ""SHADE"" is a good candidate: 
- S, H, D are new.

But let me see if there is a word that covers more common letters.

""SLATE"": but we cannot use T because T was marked as not in the word in the first guess. So T is not allowed. Therefore, we cannot use T.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, T.

So ""SLATE"" is invalid because it has T.

""PLANE"": P, L, A, N, E -> no T, no R, no C. So that's acceptable.

""PLANE"" uses P, L, N. These are common.

Another option: ""BLAME"": B, L, A, M, E.

We can also consider ""SHAME"": S, H, A, M, E.

I think I'll go with ""PLANE"" because it uses P, L, N which are common and we haven't tested them.

But note: we are not sure if the word has P, L, or N. We are testing them.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has S, because S is the most common letter. So ""SHADE"" or ""SHAME"".

But ""SHADE"" has D, which is less common than N? Or maybe not.

Let me check: in English, the frequency of letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, ... but we avoid R, T, C. So after A and E, the next are I, O, N, S, L.

So we should try to include N, S, L, O, I.

But we have two positions to test (1,2,4) and we can only test three new letters (since we are keeping A and E).

So we can test three new letters.

I think ""PLANE"" is a good choice: it has P, L, N.

But S is more common than P. So maybe ""SLANE""? That's not a word.

""SHINE"": but 3rd letter is I, not A. We must have A in the 3rd and E in the 5th.

So we need a word that has A in the 3rd and E in the 5th.

Words: 
- ...A..E

So the pattern is: ? ? A ? E

We can use: 
- SHAPE: S H A P E -> S, H, P
- SHAME: S H A M E -> S, H, M
- SHADE: S H A D E -> S, H, D
- BLAME: B L A M E -> B, L, M
- PLANE: P L A N E -> P, L, N
- FLAME: F L A M E -> F, L, M (but F is less common)

I think ""SHAME"" is a good option because it has S (very common) and M and H.

But let me see: we already have A and E, so we are testing S, H, M.

Alternatively, ""PLANE"" tests P, L, N.

I think both are reasonable. I'll go with ""SHAME"" because S is the most common consonant.

So my second guess: SHAME

But let me confirm: 
- S: new
- H: new
- A: already known, correct position
- M: new
- E: already known, correct position

And we avoid C, R, T.

So <guess>shame</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C, R, and T are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A is in the correct 3rd position (marked ""✓"").
- E is in the correct 5th position (marked ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A _ E`, and it **cannot** contain C, R, or T.

For the second guess:
- I need to prioritize testing new common letters (avoiding C, R, T) in positions 1, 2, and 4.
- I should keep A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position to maintain known correct placements.
- Ideal letters to test include high-frequency consonants like S, L, N, M, or H, as they appear often in 5-letter words.

A strong candidate is **""SHAME""**:
- It tests S (position 1), H (position 2), and M (position 4)—all new, common letters not yet evaluated.
- It preserves A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, T).

This guess maximizes information by covering three new high-frequency letters while building on the confirmed pattern.

<guess>shame</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: shame -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
- This means:
  - The letters C, R, T are not in the word at all.
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E

Guess 2: ""shame"" -> Feedback: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)
- Interpretation:
  - S is correct and in the right position (1st).
  - H is correct and in the right position (2nd).
  - A is correct (3rd) as before.
  - M is not in the word (x).
  - E is correct (5th) as before.
- So now we know:
  - The first five letters are: S, H, A, ?, E
  - The word is SHA?E
  - M is not in the word.

Additionally, from the first guess, we know C, R, T are not in the word.

So the secret word is SHA?E, where the 4th letter is missing. We need to find a 5-letter word that fits SHA?E and the missing letter cannot be M (since M is not in the word) and cannot be C, R, T.

What letters are possible for the 4th position?
- Any letter except those we've eliminated: C, R, T, M, and also avoiding letters already placed correctly (unless we suspect duplication, but given the feedback, we haven't seen repeated letters yet). Since A and E are already used and in their positions, and S and H are fixed, the 4th letter must be a new letter not yet tested.

We should consider common English letters that can fit in the 4th position to form a valid word.

Possible words with the pattern SHA_E:
- SHADE
- SHAKE
- SHALE
- SHAPE
- SHARE
- SHAVE
- SHAWL

But we must eliminate forbidden letters:
- SHADE: D is not forbidden (not in C, R, T, M)
- SHAKE: K is not forbidden
- SHALE: L is not forbidden
- SHAPE: P is not forbidden
- SHARE: R is forbidden (from Guess 1), so invalid
- SHAVE: V is not forbidden
- SHAWL: W is not forbidden, and L is allowed

Also note the feedback: M is not in the word, so M is eliminated, which is good because SHAME is already guessed and eliminated.

Now, we need to pick one of these as a guess. But note: we have only one letter to determine (the 4th), so we could guess any of these. However, we want to maximize the chance of getting it right or narrow down possibilities.

But we have 6 guesses total, and this is the third guess. If we guess wrong, we can get more feedback, so we can choose a word that tests a common letter to help with future guesses.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that might be the answer, but we have multiple options. Let me list the possibilities again:

Possible words (from common words):
- shade
- shake
- shale
- shape
- shave
- shawl

We haven't tested letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z (and avoiding C,R,T,M)

But note: in ""shame"", we tested M and found it's not in the word. So we can avoid M.

Now, among the possible words:
- shade: uses D
- shake: uses K
- shale: uses L
- shape: uses P
- shave: uses V
- shawl: uses W and L

We should choose a word that uses a common letter so that if it's wrong, we eliminate a common letter.

Alternatively, we can choose the most common word or one that covers frequent letters.

However, we have to guess one. Let's see the probability or commonality.

We also know that from the first guess, we tested A and E which are vowels, and now we have consonants in the 4th position.

But without more information, we can pick, say, ""SHADE"" because D is common.

But note: we want to avoid guessing a word that might contain eliminated letters? None of these have C,R,T,M.

Another idea: we can use a word that uses letters we haven't tested, but since we only have one position, it doesn't matter much.

But observe: if we guess SHADE and it's wrong, then D is eliminated, and we can proceed.

Similarly, if we guess SHAKE, K is eliminated if wrong.

Since we have multiple possibilities, we could also choose a word that has a letter that appears in multiple options? But each word has a unique letter for the 4th position in this set, except SHAWL has W and L? Wait, SHAWL is S-H-A-W-L, so the 4th letter is W and 5th is L? No, wait the pattern is 4th letter: for SHADE: D; SHAKE: K; SHALE: L; SHAPE: P; SHAVE: V; SHAWL: W.

But note: SHAWL has L as the 5th letter? No, SHAWL is spelled S-H-A-W-L, so positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:W, 5:L. But we know the 5th letter must be E, so SHAWL is not possible! Because it ends with L, but we require E at the end.

I made a mistake. The word must end with E: pattern is SHA?E, so the 5th letter is E.

Therefore, re-examining:
- SHADE: S-H-A-D-E -> yes, 4th is D
- SHAKE: S-H-A-K-E -> yes
- SHALE: S-H-A-L-E -> yes? Wait, SHALE: S-H-A-L-E -> 4th letter L, 5th E? No, L is the 4th letter, E is 5th. So it fits.
  - SHALE is a word: a type of rock.
- SHAPE: S-H-A-P-E -> 4th P, 5th E
- SHARE: not possible due to R, and also S-H-A-R-E, but R is forbidden.
- SHAVE: S-H-A-V-E -> 4th V
- SHAWL: S-H-A-W-L -> but L is the 5th letter, not E, so it doesn't fit. Therefore, SHAWL is invalid.

What about other words? Like SHINE? No, because 3rd letter must be A, not I.

We can consider less common words, but let's stick with common ones.

Possible common words: SHADE, SHAKE, SHALE, SHAPE, SHAVE, and also SHIRE? But SHIRE has R which is forbidden.

SHOTE? Not a common word, and T is eliminated.

So the most common ones are: SHADE, SHAKE, SHAPE, and SHAVE.

Now SHALE: it's valid and common enough.

We have D, K, L, P, V as the options for the 4th letter.

We need to guess one. Since we don't have any additional information, we should pick the most frequent letter or word.

But we might also consider that from the first guess, we had A and E correct, and S and H correct, meaning the word is likely common.

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests a letter that, if eliminated, might help with other possibilities? But they are all different.

Let's think tactically: we have 4 guesses left and only 5-6 possibilities? Actually, that's manageable.

We can guess ""SHADE"" first because:
- D is a very common letter.

If we guess ""SHADE"" and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback:
- If D is wrong, then we know the 4th letter is not D.
- The remaining options: SHAKE (K), SHALE (L), SHAPE (P), SHAVE (V)

Then we can pick another.

But to minimize worst-case, we might pick the letter that appears in the most possibilities, but each possibility has a unique letter.

Alternatively, we can pick a word that is most common. According to word lists, SHAPE, SHADE, SHAKE are all common.

Let me check frequencies of the letters:
- K is less common than D or L? Actually, D, L are more common than K, P, V.

But without specific data, I'll go with ""SHADE"" because it's straightforward.

But note: we haven't tested L. If SHADE is wrong, we still have SHALE with L, which is common.

However, to confirm: SHALE ends with E? SHALE is S-H-A-L-E? Yes, and E is the 5th letter.

Similarly, SHAVE: S-H-A-V-E.

I think I'll guess ""SHAPE"" because P is also common, but D is more common in 4th position? Not necessarily.

Given that L appears twice in the possible words? No, only SHALE has L. But L is a letter that might be in the word in other positions? But here we are only concerned with the 4th position.

Since we have to choose, let's alphabetically? Or randomly? Better to pick one.

I think ""shade"" is a good guess because it uses D, which we haven't tested, and it's a common word.

But to be systematic: the letter E is in the word (5th) and A is 3rd, S is 1st, H is 2nd. We know the word starts with SHA and ends with E. Common words: shade, shape, shake, shave, shale. Among these, shade and shake are very common words.

But let me count the possibilities: 5.

We can also consider if there are words with double letters, but we don't have evidence. For example, if the word was SHADE, then D would be the only unknown.

But given the feedback has been specific about positions, and no '-' for other positions, so double letters might not be present? Because in ""shame"", H and S were both correct, so no duplicate issues.

I think ""shade"" is fine.

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we can't because all known letters are fixed except one.

So I'll go with ""SHADE"".

But wait, what if the word is ""SHALE""? Then we guess SHADE, if it returns the 4th letter as 'x', then we know D is not in it, so we can try SHALE next.

But similarly, if we guess SHALE first, same thing.

To prioritize commonality: according to some sources, SHADE is the most common of these words? But SHAPE is also common.

Actually, in Wordle solutions, SHADE, SHARE, SHAPE are common words, but SHARE has R which is eliminated. So SHADE and SHAPE are both possible.

Perhaps ""SHAKE"" is also common.

But since we don't have more information, I'll choose ""SHADE"".

So the word to guess: SHADE

In the response format, we should output.

But note: the previous feedback didn't have any '-' symbols, meaning no misplaced letters, so the word must exactly match SHA?E and only the ? is unknown, and no other letters. So we are confident.

Therefore, we can make the guess SHADE.The feedback from the previous guesses reveals the following:

1. **Guess 1: ""crate"" → C(x), R(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)**:  
   - Eliminated letters: C, R, T (not in the word).  
   - Confirmed positions: A (3rd), E (5th).  
   - Pattern: `_ _ A _ E`.  

2. **Guess 2: ""shame"" → S(✓), H(✓), A(✓), M(x), E(✓)**:  
   - Confirmed positions: S (1st), H (2nd), A (3rd), E (5th).  
   - Eliminated letter: M (not in the word).  
   - Pattern: `S H A _ E`.  

The secret word is `S H A _ E`, where the fourth letter must be a valid English letter—avoiding C, R, T (from Guess 1) and M (from Guess 2)—that forms a real 5-letter word. Possible words fitting this pattern and constraints include:  
- **SHADE** (D), **SHAKE** (K), **SHALE** (L), **SHAPE** (P), or **SHAVE** (V).  

With no prior information about the fourth letter, I prioritize **SHADE** as the next guess because:  
- D is a high-frequency consonant in English, and ""SHADE"" is a common word.  
- If incorrect, the feedback on D will quickly narrow the options (to SHAKE, SHALE, SHAPE, or SHAVE) with three guesses remaining.

However, since we are avoiding C, R, T, and we have two positions to fill (1,2,4) and one of them might be a vowel.\n\nLet me try to list some words that end with ""A_E"" (so 3rd letter A, 5th letter E) and avoid C, R, T.\n\nExamples:\n- SHADE: S H A D E -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E -> but we have to check if D is allowed? We haven\'t eliminated D.\n- SHAME: S H A M E\n- SHAPE: S H A P E\n- SLADE: but L is allowed? Yes, we haven\'t eliminated L.\n- BLADE: B L A D E -> but B and L are not eliminated.\n\nBut note: we must avoid using C, R, T.\n\nAlso, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet me think of words that have distinct letters and cover common ones.\n\nAnother idea: since we know two letters (A and E) and their positions, we can focus on the unknown positions (1,2,4) and use common letters.\n\nWe can try ""SHADE"": \n- S, H, D are new letters.\n\nBut let me check if there are better options.\n\n""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B, L, M are new.\n\n""PLANE"": but we cannot use R? Wait, PLANE has R? No, PLANE: P, L, A, N, E -> no R? Wait, PLANE is P-L-A-N-E. So no R, and we avoid C, R, T? We avoid R, so we cannot use R. But PLANE does not have R. It has P, L, A, N, E. So that\'s okay? But we have to check: we haven\'t eliminated P, L, N.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess said R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. But PLANE doesn\'t have R, so it\'s okay.\n\nHowever, we also know that the 3rd letter is A and 5th is E, so PLANE fits: P L A N E -> 3rd is A, 5th is E.\n\nBut we must avoid using the letters that are not in the word: C, R, T. So PLANE is acceptable.\n\nBut we also want to test more common letters. Let me see the frequency.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has S, because S is very common.\n\nAnother word: ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> but we avoid R? No R. But we have to avoid C, R, T. SPADE has S, P, A, D, E. So that\'s okay.\n\nBut note: we already know A and E are in the word and in the correct positions, so in our guess, we can keep A and E in the same positions to confirm (but they are already confirmed) and test new letters in the other positions.\n\nSo for the second guess, we can choose a word that has A in the 3rd and E in the 5th, and uses new letters for positions 1,2,4.\n\nWe should avoid using C, R, T.\n\nLet me choose a word that uses common letters that we haven\'t tried: for example, S, L, N, D, P, M, B, etc.\n\nI think ""SHADE"" is a good candidate: \n- S, H, D are new.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that covers more common letters.\n\n""SLATE"": but we cannot use T because T was marked as not in the word in the first guess. So T is not allowed. Therefore, we cannot use T.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use C, R, T.\n\nSo ""SLATE"" is invalid because it has T.\n\n""PLANE"": P, L, A, N, E -> no T, no R, no C. So that\'s acceptable.\n\n""PLANE"" uses P, L, N. These are common.\n\nAnother option: ""BLAME"": B, L, A, M, E.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHAME"": S, H, A, M, E.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""PLANE"" because it uses P, L, N which are common and we haven\'t tested them.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has P, L, or N. We are testing them.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has S, because S is the most common letter. So ""SHADE"" or ""SHAME"".\n\nBut ""SHADE"" has D, which is less common than N? Or maybe not.\n\nLet me check: in English, the frequency of letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, ... but we avoid R, T, C. So after A and E, the next are I, O, N, S, L.\n\nSo we should try to include N, S, L, O, I.\n\nBut we have two positions to test (1,2,4) and we can only test three new letters (since we are keeping A and E).\n\nSo we can test three new letters.\n\nI think ""PLANE"" is a good choice: it has P, L, N.\n\nBut S is more common than P. So maybe ""SLANE""? That\'s not a word.\n\n""SHINE"": but 3rd letter is I, not A. We must have A in the 3rd and E in the 5th.\n\nSo we need a word that has A in the 3rd and E in the 5th.\n\nWords: \n- ...A..E\n\nSo the pattern is: ? ? A ? E\n\nWe can use: \n- SHAPE: S H A P E -> S, H, P\n- SHAME: S H A M E -> S, H, M\n- SHADE: S H A D E -> S, H, D\n- BLAME: B L A M E -> B, L, M\n- PLANE: P L A N E -> P, L, N\n- FLAME: F L A M E -> F, L, M (but F is less common)\n\nI think ""SHAME"" is a good option because it has S (very common) and M and H.\n\nBut let me see: we already have A and E, so we are testing S, H, M.\n\nAlternatively, ""PLANE"" tests P, L, N.\n\nI think both are reasonable. I\'ll go with ""SHAME"" because S is the most common consonant.\n\nSo my second guess: SHAME\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- S: new\n- H: new\n- A: already known, correct position\n- M: new\n- E: already known, correct position\n\nAnd we avoid C, R, T.\n\nSo <guess>shame</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":\n- C, R, and T are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- A is in the correct 3rd position (marked ""✓"").\n- E is in the correct 5th position (marked ""✓"").\n\nThis means the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A _ E`, and it **cannot** contain C, R, or T.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- I need to prioritize testing new common letters (avoiding C, R, T) in positions 1, 2, and 4.\n- I should keep A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position to maintain known correct placements.\n- Ideal letters to test include high-frequency consonants like S, L, N, M, or H, as they appear often in 5-letter words.\n\nA strong candidate is **""SHAME""**:\n- It tests S (position 1), H (position 2), and M (position 4)—all new, common letters not yet evaluated.\n- It preserves A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, T).\n\nThis guess maximizes information by covering three new high-frequency letters while building on the confirmed pattern.\n\n<guess>shame</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: shame -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crate"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n- This means:\n  - The letters C, R, T are not in the word at all.\n  - A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).\n  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).\n- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E\n\nGuess 2: ""shame"" -> Feedback: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)\n- Interpretation:\n  - S is correct and in the right position (1st).\n  - H is correct and in the right position (2nd).\n  - A is correct (3rd) as before.\n  - M is not in the word (x).\n  - E is correct (5th) as before.\n- So now we know:\n  - The first five letters are: S, H, A, ?, E\n  - The word is SHA?E\n  - M is not in the word.\n\nAdditionally, from the first guess, we know C, R, T are not in the word.\n\nSo the secret word is SHA?E, where the 4th letter is missing. We need to find a 5-letter word that fits SHA?E and the missing letter cannot be M (since M is not in the word) and cannot be C, R, T.\n\nWhat letters are possible for the 4th position?\n- Any letter except those we\'ve eliminated: C, R, T, M, and also avoiding letters already placed correctly (unless we suspect duplication, but given the feedback, we haven\'t seen repeated letters yet). Since A and E are already used and in their positions, and S and H are fixed, the 4th letter must be a new letter not yet tested.\n\nWe should consider common English letters that can fit in the 4th position to form a valid word.\n\nPossible words with the pattern SHA_E:\n- SHADE\n- SHAKE\n- SHALE\n- SHAPE\n- SHARE\n- SHAVE\n- SHAWL\n\nBut we must eliminate forbidden letters:\n- SHADE: D is not forbidden (not in C, R, T, M)\n- SHAKE: K is not forbidden\n- SHALE: L is not forbidden\n- SHAPE: P is not forbidden\n- SHARE: R is forbidden (from Guess 1), so invalid\n- SHAVE: V is not forbidden\n- SHAWL: W is not forbidden, and L is allowed\n\nAlso note the feedback: M is not in the word, so M is eliminated, which is good because SHAME is already guessed and eliminated.\n\nNow, we need to pick one of these as a guess. But note: we have only one letter to determine (the 4th), so we could guess any of these. However, we want to maximize the chance of getting it right or narrow down possibilities.\n\nBut we have 6 guesses total, and this is the third guess. If we guess wrong, we can get more feedback, so we can choose a word that tests a common letter to help with future guesses.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that might be the answer, but we have multiple options. Let me list the possibilities again:\n\nPossible words (from common words):\n- shade\n- shake\n- shale\n- shape\n- shave\n- shawl\n\nWe haven\'t tested letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z (and avoiding C,R,T,M)\n\nBut note: in ""shame"", we tested M and found it\'s not in the word. So we can avoid M.\n\nNow, among the possible words:\n- shade: uses D\n- shake: uses K\n- shale: uses L\n- shape: uses P\n- shave: uses V\n- shawl: uses W and L\n\nWe should choose a word that uses a common letter so that if it\'s wrong, we eliminate a common letter.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose the most common word or one that covers frequent letters.\n\nHowever, we have to guess one. Let\'s see the probability or commonality.\n\nWe also know that from the first guess, we tested A and E which are vowels, and now we have consonants in the 4th position.\n\nBut without more information, we can pick, say, ""SHADE"" because D is common.\n\nBut note: we want to avoid guessing a word that might contain eliminated letters? None of these have C,R,T,M.\n\nAnother idea: we can use a word that uses letters we haven\'t tested, but since we only have one position, it doesn\'t matter much.\n\nBut observe: if we guess SHADE and it\'s wrong, then D is eliminated, and we can proceed.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess SHAKE, K is eliminated if wrong.\n\nSince we have multiple possibilities, we could also choose a word that has a letter that appears in multiple options? But each word has a unique letter for the 4th position in this set, except SHAWL has W and L? Wait, SHAWL is S-H-A-W-L, so the 4th letter is W and 5th is L? No, wait the pattern is 4th letter: for SHADE: D; SHAKE: K; SHALE: L; SHAPE: P; SHAVE: V; SHAWL: W.\n\nBut note: SHAWL has L as the 5th letter? No, SHAWL is spelled S-H-A-W-L, so positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:W, 5:L. But we know the 5th letter must be E, so SHAWL is not possible! Because it ends with L, but we require E at the end.\n\nI made a mistake. The word must end with E: pattern is SHA?E, so the 5th letter is E.\n\nTherefore, re-examining:\n- SHADE: S-H-A-D-E -> yes, 4th is D\n- SHAKE: S-H-A-K-E -> yes\n- SHALE: S-H-A-L-E -> yes? Wait, SHALE: S-H-A-L-E -> 4th letter L, 5th E? No, L is the 4th letter, E is 5th. So it fits.\n  - SHALE is a word: a type of rock.\n- SHAPE: S-H-A-P-E -> 4th P, 5th E\n- SHARE: not possible due to R, and also S-H-A-R-E, but R is forbidden.\n- SHAVE: S-H-A-V-E -> 4th V\n- SHAWL: S-H-A-W-L -> but L is the 5th letter, not E, so it doesn\'t fit. Therefore, SHAWL is invalid.\n\nWhat about other words? Like SHINE? No, because 3rd letter must be A, not I.\n\nWe can consider less common words, but let\'s stick with common ones.\n\nPossible common words: SHADE, SHAKE, SHALE, SHAPE, SHAVE, and also SHIRE? But SHIRE has R which is forbidden.\n\nSHOTE? Not a common word, and T is eliminated.\n\nSo the most common ones are: SHADE, SHAKE, SHAPE, and SHAVE.\n\nNow SHALE: it\'s valid and common enough.\n\nWe have D, K, L, P, V as the options for the 4th letter.\n\nWe need to guess one. Since we don\'t have any additional information, we should pick the most frequent letter or word.\n\nBut we might also consider that from the first guess, we had A and E correct, and S and H correct, meaning the word is likely common.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that tests a letter that, if eliminated, might help with other possibilities? But they are all different.\n\nLet\'s think tactically: we have 4 guesses left and only 5-6 possibilities? Actually, that\'s manageable.\n\nWe can guess ""SHADE"" first because:\n- D is a very common letter.\n\nIf we guess ""SHADE"" and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback:\n- If D is wrong, then we know the 4th letter is not D.\n- The remaining options: SHAKE (K), SHALE (L), SHAPE (P), SHAVE (V)\n\nThen we can pick another.\n\nBut to minimize worst-case, we might pick the letter that appears in the most possibilities, but each possibility has a unique letter.\n\nAlternatively, we can pick a word that is most common. According to word lists, SHAPE, SHADE, SHAKE are all common.\n\nLet me check frequencies of the letters:\n- K is less common than D or L? Actually, D, L are more common than K, P, V.\n\nBut without specific data, I\'ll go with ""SHADE"" because it\'s straightforward.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested L. If SHADE is wrong, we still have SHALE with L, which is common.\n\nHowever, to confirm: SHALE ends with E? SHALE is S-H-A-L-E? Yes, and E is the 5th letter.\n\nSimilarly, SHAVE: S-H-A-V-E.\n\nI think I\'ll guess ""SHAPE"" because P is also common, but D is more common in 4th position? Not necessarily.\n\nGiven that L appears twice in the possible words? No, only SHALE has L. But L is a letter that might be in the word in other positions? But here we are only concerned with the 4th position.\n\nSince we have to choose, let\'s alphabetically? Or randomly? Better to pick one.\n\nI think ""shade"" is a good guess because it uses D, which we haven\'t tested, and it\'s a common word.\n\nBut to be systematic: the letter E is in the word (5th) and A is 3rd, S is 1st, H is 2nd. We know the word starts with SHA and ends with E. Common words: shade, shape, shake, shave, shale. Among these, shade and shake are very common words.\n\nBut let me count the possibilities: 5.\n\nWe can also consider if there are words with double letters, but we don\'t have evidence. For example, if the word was SHADE, then D would be the only unknown.\n\nBut given the feedback has been specific about positions, and no \'-\' for other positions, so double letters might not be present? Because in ""shame"", H and S were both correct, so no duplicate issues.\n\nI think ""shade"" is fine.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we can\'t because all known letters are fixed except one.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SHADE"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word is ""SHALE""? Then we guess SHADE, if it returns the 4th letter as \'x\', then we know D is not in it, so we can try SHALE next.\n\nBut similarly, if we guess SHALE first, same thing.\n\nTo prioritize commonality: according to some sources, SHADE is the most common of these words? But SHAPE is also common.\n\nActually, in Wordle solutions, SHADE, SHARE, SHAPE are common words, but SHARE has R which is eliminated. So SHADE and SHAPE are both possible.\n\nPerhaps ""SHAKE"" is also common.\n\nBut since we don\'t have more information, I\'ll choose ""SHADE"".\n\nSo the word to guess: SHADE\n\nIn the response format, we should output.\n\nBut note: the previous feedback didn\'t have any \'-\' symbols, meaning no misplaced letters, so the word must exactly match SHA?E and only the ? is unknown, and no other letters. So we are confident.\n\nTherefore, we can make the guess SHADE.The feedback from the previous guesses reveals the following:\n\n1. **Guess 1: ""crate"" → C(x), R(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)**:  \n   - Eliminated letters: C, R, T (not in the word).  \n   - Confirmed positions: A (3rd), E (5th).  \n   - Pattern: `_ _ A _ E`.  \n\n2. **Guess 2: ""shame"" → S(✓), H(✓), A(✓), M(x), E(✓)**:  \n   - Confirmed positions: S (1st), H (2nd), A (3rd), E (5th).  \n   - Eliminated letter: M (not in the word).  \n   - Pattern: `S H A _ E`.  \n\nThe secret word is `S H A _ E`, where the fourth letter must be a valid English letter—avoiding C, R, T (from Guess 1) and M (from Guess 2)—that forms a real 5-letter word. Possible words fitting this pattern and constraints include:  \n- **SHADE** (D), **SHAKE** (K), **SHALE** (L), **SHAPE** (P), or **SHAVE** (V).  \n\nWith no prior information about the fourth letter, I prioritize **SHADE** as the next guess because:  \n- D is a high-frequency consonant in English, and ""SHADE"" is a common word.  \n- If incorrect, the feedback on D will quickly narrow the options (to SHAKE, SHALE, SHAPE, or SHAVE) with three guesses remaining.\n\n<guess>shade</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: shame -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: shade -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate"" -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
  - This tells us:
    - C, R, T are not in the word.
    - A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
    - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
  - So the word pattern is: _ _ A _ E

Guess 2: ""shame"" -> S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)
  - This tells us:
    - S is in the word and in the correct position (1st).
    - H is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
    - A is correct (3rd) as before.
    - M is not in the word.
    - E is correct (5th) as before.
  - So now the pattern is: S H A _ E
  - And we know M is not in the word.

Guess 3: ""shade"" -> S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
  - This tells us:
    - S, H, A, E are in their correct positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th).
    - D is not in the word.

So now we have:
- The word is S H A ? E, where ? is the 4th letter.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, T, M, D (and any others we haven't seen? We haven't tested many, but these are known not to be in the word).
- We know the 4th letter must be a letter that is not C, R, T, M, D, and it must form a valid English word.

Possible words that fit the pattern ""S H A _ E"" and avoid the eliminated letters:

- We already tried ""shade"" and D is wrong, so not that.
- Other possibilities: 
  - ""shake"" -> 4th letter K
  - ""shale"" -> 4th letter L
  - ""shape"" -> 4th letter P
  - ""shave"" -> 4th letter V

We need to choose one of these for the next guess.

We have 4 options. We can pick any, but we want to maximize the chance of being correct or getting useful feedback.

Since we have only one letter to determine, we can try the most common word or the most common letter.

Commonality of the words:
- ""shake"" is a very common word.
- ""shape"" is common.
- ""shale"" is less common but still valid.
- ""shave"" is common.

Commonality of the letters (for the 4th position):
- K, L, P, V are all possible.

We might consider which letter is more frequent in English. According to letter frequency, L is more common than P, K, and V.

But in the context of 5-letter words ending with ""E"", L and P are both common.

We can also think about the fact that we have 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 of 6). So we can afford to be wrong once.

But to be efficient, we can try ""shake"" because K is a letter that, if wrong, we still have two more guesses.

Alternatively, we can try ""shape"" because P is also common.

I think I'll go with ""shake"" as it's a very common word.

So the next guess: ""shake""

But let's confirm: 
- S, H, A, E are in the same positions, and we are testing K in the 4th.

If it's correct, we win. If not, we know K is not in the word, so we can try ""shape"" or ""shale"" next.

We could also consider ""shale"" to test L.

But I think ""shake"" is a good choice.

Therefore, the guess is ""shake"".

The feedback from previous guesses has fully confirmed the positions of four letters:  
- **S** (1st), **H** (2nd), **A** (3rd), and **E** (5th).  
- The secret word is `S H A _ E`, with only the 4th letter unknown.  

Eliminated letters (not in the word): **C, R, T, M, D**.  

Possible words fitting the pattern and constraints:  
- **SHAKE** (4th = K)  
- **SHALE** (4th = L)  
- **SHAPE** (4th = P)  
- **SHAVE** (4th = V)  

For the next guess, I prioritize **SHAKE** because:  
- **K** is a common consonant in English 5-letter words.  
- ""SHAKE"" is a high-frequency word, increasing the likelihood of a correct guess.  
- If incorrect, feedback on **K** will definitively identify the solution from the remaining options (e.g., if K is wrong, try SHALE/SHAPE/SHAVE next).

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have to guess a 5-letter word.
 Since it's the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback, so we should choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Let me choose a word that has letters that are frequently used in English: for example, ""CRATE"".

 Why ""CRATE""?
 - It has five distinct letters: C, R, A, T, E.
 - The letters are common: A, E, and R are very common, and C and T are also common.
 - This word uses two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 However, note that we can use any valid English word. Let's consider ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". 
 But I'll go with ""CRATE"" for the first guess.

 Let me output in the required format.I am making my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I'll choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information gathering. The word ""CRATE"" is a strong starting choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, T).
- All five letters are distinct, allowing me to test more characters at once.
- These letters frequently appear in English 5-letter words.

<guess>crate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crate"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

So we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.
- The letters C, R, T are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the word pattern is: _ _ A _ E

We need to make a second guess that is a valid 5-letter English word, and we should avoid using C, R, T.

We also know that the word must have A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.

Let's think of words that fit: _ _ A _ E

We can try to use other common letters to test the remaining positions.

Possible letters for the first, second, and fourth positions (avoiding C, R, T).

Common consonants: S, L, N, D, G, B, P, M, etc.
Common vowels: O, I, U (but we already have A and E, so maybe we don't need more vowels? But we can use them if they fit).

We should also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But in the feedback, we didn't see any indication of repetition, but it's possible. However, since we are avoiding C, R, T, and we have two positions to fill (1,2,4) and one of them might be a vowel.

Let me try to list some words that end with ""A_E"" (so 3rd letter A, 5th letter E) and avoid C, R, T.

Examples:
- SHADE: S H A D E -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E -> but we have to check if D is allowed? We haven't eliminated D.
- SHAME: S H A M E
- SHAPE: S H A P E
- SLADE: but L is allowed? Yes, we haven't eliminated L.
- BLADE: B L A D E -> but B and L are not eliminated.

But note: we must avoid using C, R, T.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me think of words that have distinct letters and cover common ones.

Another idea: since we know two letters (A and E) and their positions, we can focus on the unknown positions (1,2,4) and use common letters.

We can try ""SHADE"": 
- S, H, D are new letters.

But let me check if there are better options.

""BLAME"": B L A M E -> B, L, M are new.

""PLANE"": but we cannot use R? Wait, PLANE has R? No, PLANE: P, L, A, N, E -> no R? Wait, PLANE is P-L-A-N-E. So no R, and we avoid C, R, T? We avoid R, so we cannot use R. But PLANE does not have R. It has P, L, A, N, E. So that's okay? But we have to check: we haven't eliminated P, L, N.

But note: the feedback for the first guess said R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. But PLANE doesn't have R, so it's okay.

However, we also know that the 3rd letter is A and 5th is E, so PLANE fits: P L A N E -> 3rd is A, 5th is E.

But we must avoid using the letters that are not in the word: C, R, T. So PLANE is acceptable.

But we also want to test more common letters. Let me see the frequency.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has S, because S is very common.

Another word: ""SPADE"": S P A D E -> but we avoid R? No R. But we have to avoid C, R, T. SPADE has S, P, A, D, E. So that's okay.

But note: we already know A and E are in the word and in the correct positions, so in our guess, we can keep A and E in the same positions to confirm (but they are already confirmed) and test new letters in the other positions.

So for the second guess, we can choose a word that has A in the 3rd and E in the 5th, and uses new letters for positions 1,2,4.

We should avoid using C, R, T.

Let me choose a word that uses common letters that we haven't tried: for example, S, L, N, D, P, M, B, etc.

I think ""SHADE"" is a good candidate: 
- S, H, D are new.

But let me see if there is a word that covers more common letters.

""SLATE"": but we cannot use T because T was marked as not in the word in the first guess. So T is not allowed. Therefore, we cannot use T.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, T.

So ""SLATE"" is invalid because it has T.

""PLANE"": P, L, A, N, E -> no T, no R, no C. So that's acceptable.

""PLANE"" uses P, L, N. These are common.

Another option: ""BLAME"": B, L, A, M, E.

We can also consider ""SHAME"": S, H, A, M, E.

I think I'll go with ""PLANE"" because it uses P, L, N which are common and we haven't tested them.

But note: we are not sure if the word has P, L, or N. We are testing them.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has S, because S is the most common letter. So ""SHADE"" or ""SHAME"".

But ""SHADE"" has D, which is less common than N? Or maybe not.

Let me check: in English, the frequency of letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, ... but we avoid R, T, C. So after A and E, the next are I, O, N, S, L.

So we should try to include N, S, L, O, I.

But we have two positions to test (1,2,4) and we can only test three new letters (since we are keeping A and E).

So we can test three new letters.

I think ""PLANE"" is a good choice: it has P, L, N.

But S is more common than P. So maybe ""SLANE""? That's not a word.

""SHINE"": but 3rd letter is I, not A. We must have A in the 3rd and E in the 5th.

So we need a word that has A in the 3rd and E in the 5th.

Words: 
- ...A..E

So the pattern is: ? ? A ? E

We can use: 
- SHAPE: S H A P E -> S, H, P
- SHAME: S H A M E -> S, H, M
- SHADE: S H A D E -> S, H, D
- BLAME: B L A M E -> B, L, M
- PLANE: P L A N E -> P, L, N
- FLAME: F L A M E -> F, L, M (but F is less common)

I think ""SHAME"" is a good option because it has S (very common) and M and H.

But let me see: we already have A and E, so we are testing S, H, M.

Alternatively, ""PLANE"" tests P, L, N.

I think both are reasonable. I'll go with ""SHAME"" because S is the most common consonant.

So my second guess: SHAME

But let me confirm: 
- S: new
- H: new
- A: already known, correct position
- M: new
- E: already known, correct position

And we avoid C, R, T.

So <guess>shame</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C, R, and T are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A is in the correct 3rd position (marked ""✓"").
- E is in the correct 5th position (marked ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A _ E`, and it **cannot** contain C, R, or T.

For the second guess:
- I need to prioritize testing new common letters (avoiding C, R, T) in positions 1, 2, and 4.
- I should keep A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position to maintain known correct placements.
- Ideal letters to test include high-frequency consonants like S, L, N, M, or H, as they appear often in 5-letter words.

A strong candidate is **""SHAME""**:
- It tests S (position 1), H (position 2), and M (position 4)—all new, common letters not yet evaluated.
- It preserves A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, T).

This guess maximizes information by covering three new high-frequency letters while building on the confirmed pattern.

<guess>shame</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: shame -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
- This means:
  - The letters C, R, T are not in the word at all.
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E

Guess 2: ""shame"" -> Feedback: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)
- Interpretation:
  - S is correct and in the right position (1st).
  - H is correct and in the right position (2nd).
  - A is correct (3rd) as before.
  - M is not in the word (x).
  - E is correct (5th) as before.
- So now we know:
  - The first five letters are: S, H, A, ?, E
  - The word is SHA?E
  - M is not in the word.

Additionally, from the first guess, we know C, R, T are not in the word.

So the secret word is SHA?E, where the 4th letter is missing. We need to find a 5-letter word that fits SHA?E and the missing letter cannot be M (since M is not in the word) and cannot be C, R, T.

What letters are possible for the 4th position?
- Any letter except those we've eliminated: C, R, T, M, and also avoiding letters already placed correctly (unless we suspect duplication, but given the feedback, we haven't seen repeated letters yet). Since A and E are already used and in their positions, and S and H are fixed, the 4th letter must be a new letter not yet tested.

We should consider common English letters that can fit in the 4th position to form a valid word.

Possible words with the pattern SHA_E:
- SHADE
- SHAKE
- SHALE
- SHAPE
- SHARE
- SHAVE
- SHAWL

But we must eliminate forbidden letters:
- SHADE: D is not forbidden (not in C, R, T, M)
- SHAKE: K is not forbidden
- SHALE: L is not forbidden
- SHAPE: P is not forbidden
- SHARE: R is forbidden (from Guess 1), so invalid
- SHAVE: V is not forbidden
- SHAWL: W is not forbidden, and L is allowed

Also note the feedback: M is not in the word, so M is eliminated, which is good because SHAME is already guessed and eliminated.

Now, we need to pick one of these as a guess. But note: we have only one letter to determine (the 4th), so we could guess any of these. However, we want to maximize the chance of getting it right or narrow down possibilities.

But we have 6 guesses total, and this is the third guess. If we guess wrong, we can get more feedback, so we can choose a word that tests a common letter to help with future guesses.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that might be the answer, but we have multiple options. Let me list the possibilities again:

Possible words (from common words):
- shade
- shake
- shale
- shape
- shave
- shawl

We haven't tested letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z (and avoiding C,R,T,M)

But note: in ""shame"", we tested M and found it's not in the word. So we can avoid M.

Now, among the possible words:
- shade: uses D
- shake: uses K
- shale: uses L
- shape: uses P
- shave: uses V
- shawl: uses W and L

We should choose a word that uses a common letter so that if it's wrong, we eliminate a common letter.

Alternatively, we can choose the most common word or one that covers frequent letters.

However, we have to guess one. Let's see the probability or commonality.

We also know that from the first guess, we tested A and E which are vowels, and now we have consonants in the 4th position.

But without more information, we can pick, say, ""SHADE"" because D is common.

But note: we want to avoid guessing a word that might contain eliminated letters? None of these have C,R,T,M.

Another idea: we can use a word that uses letters we haven't tested, but since we only have one position, it doesn't matter much.

But observe: if we guess SHADE and it's wrong, then D is eliminated, and we can proceed.

Similarly, if we guess SHAKE, K is eliminated if wrong.

Since we have multiple possibilities, we could also choose a word that has a letter that appears in multiple options? But each word has a unique letter for the 4th position in this set, except SHAWL has W and L? Wait, SHAWL is S-H-A-W-L, so the 4th letter is W and 5th is L? No, wait the pattern is 4th letter: for SHADE: D; SHAKE: K; SHALE: L; SHAPE: P; SHAVE: V; SHAWL: W.

But note: SHAWL has L as the 5th letter? No, SHAWL is spelled S-H-A-W-L, so positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:W, 5:L. But we know the 5th letter must be E, so SHAWL is not possible! Because it ends with L, but we require E at the end.

I made a mistake. The word must end with E: pattern is SHA?E, so the 5th letter is E.

Therefore, re-examining:
- SHADE: S-H-A-D-E -> yes, 4th is D
- SHAKE: S-H-A-K-E -> yes
- SHALE: S-H-A-L-E -> yes? Wait, SHALE: S-H-A-L-E -> 4th letter L, 5th E? No, L is the 4th letter, E is 5th. So it fits.
  - SHALE is a word: a type of rock.
- SHAPE: S-H-A-P-E -> 4th P, 5th E
- SHARE: not possible due to R, and also S-H-A-R-E, but R is forbidden.
- SHAVE: S-H-A-V-E -> 4th V
- SHAWL: S-H-A-W-L -> but L is the 5th letter, not E, so it doesn't fit. Therefore, SHAWL is invalid.

What about other words? Like SHINE? No, because 3rd letter must be A, not I.

We can consider less common words, but let's stick with common ones.

Possible common words: SHADE, SHAKE, SHALE, SHAPE, SHAVE, and also SHIRE? But SHIRE has R which is forbidden.

SHOTE? Not a common word, and T is eliminated.

So the most common ones are: SHADE, SHAKE, SHAPE, and SHAVE.

Now SHALE: it's valid and common enough.

We have D, K, L, P, V as the options for the 4th letter.

We need to guess one. Since we don't have any additional information, we should pick the most frequent letter or word.

But we might also consider that from the first guess, we had A and E correct, and S and H correct, meaning the word is likely common.

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests a letter that, if eliminated, might help with other possibilities? But they are all different.

Let's think tactically: we have 4 guesses left and only 5-6 possibilities? Actually, that's manageable.

We can guess ""SHADE"" first because:
- D is a very common letter.

If we guess ""SHADE"" and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback:
- If D is wrong, then we know the 4th letter is not D.
- The remaining options: SHAKE (K), SHALE (L), SHAPE (P), SHAVE (V)

Then we can pick another.

But to minimize worst-case, we might pick the letter that appears in the most possibilities, but each possibility has a unique letter.

Alternatively, we can pick a word that is most common. According to word lists, SHAPE, SHADE, SHAKE are all common.

Let me check frequencies of the letters:
- K is less common than D or L? Actually, D, L are more common than K, P, V.

But without specific data, I'll go with ""SHADE"" because it's straightforward.

But note: we haven't tested L. If SHADE is wrong, we still have SHALE with L, which is common.

However, to confirm: SHALE ends with E? SHALE is S-H-A-L-E? Yes, and E is the 5th letter.

Similarly, SHAVE: S-H-A-V-E.

I think I'll guess ""SHAPE"" because P is also common, but D is more common in 4th position? Not necessarily.

Given that L appears twice in the possible words? No, only SHALE has L. But L is a letter that might be in the word in other positions? But here we are only concerned with the 4th position.

Since we have to choose, let's alphabetically? Or randomly? Better to pick one.

I think ""shade"" is a good guess because it uses D, which we haven't tested, and it's a common word.

But to be systematic: the letter E is in the word (5th) and A is 3rd, S is 1st, H is 2nd. We know the word starts with SHA and ends with E. Common words: shade, shape, shake, shave, shale. Among these, shade and shake are very common words.

But let me count the possibilities: 5.

We can also consider if there are words with double letters, but we don't have evidence. For example, if the word was SHADE, then D would be the only unknown.

But given the feedback has been specific about positions, and no '-' for other positions, so double letters might not be present? Because in ""shame"", H and S were both correct, so no duplicate issues.

I think ""shade"" is fine.

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we can't because all known letters are fixed except one.

So I'll go with ""SHADE"".

But wait, what if the word is ""SHALE""? Then we guess SHADE, if it returns the 4th letter as 'x', then we know D is not in it, so we can try SHALE next.

But similarly, if we guess SHALE first, same thing.

To prioritize commonality: according to some sources, SHADE is the most common of these words? But SHAPE is also common.

Actually, in Wordle solutions, SHADE, SHARE, SHAPE are common words, but SHARE has R which is eliminated. So SHADE and SHAPE are both possible.

Perhaps ""SHAKE"" is also common.

But since we don't have more information, I'll choose ""SHADE"".

So the word to guess: SHADE

In the response format, we should output.

But note: the previous feedback didn't have any '-' symbols, meaning no misplaced letters, so the word must exactly match SHA?E and only the ? is unknown, and no other letters. So we are confident.

Therefore, we can make the guess SHADE.The feedback from the previous guesses reveals the following:

1. **Guess 1: ""crate"" → C(x), R(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)**:  
   - Eliminated letters: C, R, T (not in the word).  
   - Confirmed positions: A (3rd), E (5th).  
   - Pattern: `_ _ A _ E`.  

2. **Guess 2: ""shame"" → S(✓), H(✓), A(✓), M(x), E(✓)**:  
   - Confirmed positions: S (1st), H (2nd), A (3rd), E (5th).  
   - Eliminated letter: M (not in the word).  
   - Pattern: `S H A _ E`.  

The secret word is `S H A _ E`, where the fourth letter must be a valid English letter—avoiding C, R, T (from Guess 1) and M (from Guess 2)—that forms a real 5-letter word. Possible words fitting this pattern and constraints include:  
- **SHADE** (D), **SHAKE** (K), **SHALE** (L), **SHAPE** (P), or **SHAVE** (V).  

With no prior information about the fourth letter, I prioritize **SHADE** as the next guess because:  
- D is a high-frequency consonant in English, and ""SHADE"" is a common word.  
- If incorrect, the feedback on D will quickly narrow the options (to SHAKE, SHALE, SHAPE, or SHAVE) with three guesses remaining.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: shame -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: shade -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate"" -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
  - This tells us:
    - C, R, T are not in the word.
    - A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
    - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
  - So the word pattern is: _ _ A _ E

Guess 2: ""shame"" -> S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)
  - This tells us:
    - S is in the word and in the correct position (1st).
    - H is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
    - A is correct (3rd) as before.
    - M is not in the word.
    - E is correct (5th) as before.
  - So now the pattern is: S H A _ E
  - And we know M is not in the word.

Guess 3: ""shade"" -> S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
  - This tells us:
    - S, H, A, E are in their correct positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th).
    - D is not in the word.

So now we have:
- The word is S H A ? E, where ? is the 4th letter.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, T, M, D (and any others we haven't seen? We haven't tested many, but these are known not to be in the word).
- We know the 4th letter must be a letter that is not C, R, T, M, D, and it must form a valid English word.

Possible words that fit the pattern ""S H A _ E"" and avoid the eliminated letters:

- We already tried ""shade"" and D is wrong, so not that.
- Other possibilities: 
  - ""shake"" -> 4th letter K
  - ""shale"" -> 4th letter L
  - ""shape"" -> 4th letter P
  - ""shave"" -> 4th letter V

We need to choose one of these for the next guess.

We have 4 options. We can pick any, but we want to maximize the chance of being correct or getting useful feedback.

Since we have only one letter to determine, we can try the most common word or the most common letter.

Commonality of the words:
- ""shake"" is a very common word.
- ""shape"" is common.
- ""shale"" is less common but still valid.
- ""shave"" is common.

Commonality of the letters (for the 4th position):
- K, L, P, V are all possible.

We might consider which letter is more frequent in English. According to letter frequency, L is more common than P, K, and V.

But in the context of 5-letter words ending with ""E"", L and P are both common.

We can also think about the fact that we have 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 of 6). So we can afford to be wrong once.

But to be efficient, we can try ""shake"" because K is a letter that, if wrong, we still have two more guesses.

Alternatively, we can try ""shape"" because P is also common.

I think I'll go with ""shake"" as it's a very common word.

So the next guess: ""shake""

But let's confirm: 
- S, H, A, E are in the same positions, and we are testing K in the 4th.

If it's correct, we win. If not, we know K is not in the word, so we can try ""shape"" or ""shale"" next.

We could also consider ""shale"" to test L.

But I think ""shake"" is a good choice.

Therefore, the guess is ""shake"".The feedback from previous guesses has fully confirmed the positions of four letters:  
- **S** (1st), **H** (2nd), **A** (3rd), and **E** (5th).  
- The secret word is `S H A _ E`, with only the 4th letter unknown.  

Eliminated letters (not in the word): **C, R, T, M, D**.  

Possible words fitting the pattern and constraints:  
- **SHAKE** (4th = K)  
- **SHALE** (4th = L)  
- **SHAPE** (4th = P)  
- **SHAVE** (4th = V)  

For the next guess, I prioritize **SHAKE** because:  
- **K** is a common consonant in English 5-letter words.  
- ""SHAKE"" is a high-frequency word, increasing the likelihood of a correct guess.  
- If incorrect, feedback on **K** will definitively identify the solution from the remaining options (e.g., if K is wrong, try SHALE/SHAPE/SHAVE next).

Wait, PLANE has R? No, PLANE: P, L, A, N, E -> no R? Wait, PLANE is P-L-A-N-E. So no R, and we avoid C, R, T? We avoid R, so we cannot use R. But PLANE does not have R. It has P, L, A, N, E. So that\'s okay? But we have to check: we haven\'t eliminated P, L, N.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess said R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. But PLANE doesn\'t have R, so it\'s okay.\n\nHowever, we also know that the 3rd letter is A and 5th is E, so PLANE fits: P L A N E -> 3rd is A, 5th is E.\n\nBut we must avoid using the letters that are not in the word: C, R, T. So PLANE is acceptable.\n\nBut we also want to test more common letters.

We are testing them.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has S, because S is the most common letter. So ""SHADE"" or ""SHAME"".\n\nBut ""SHADE"" has D, which is less common than N? Or maybe not.\n\nLet me check: in English, the frequency of letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, ... but we avoid R, T, C. So after A and E, the next are I, O, N, S, L.\n\nSo we should try to include N, S, L, O, I.\n\nBut we have two positions to test (1,2,4) and we can only test three new letters (since we are keeping A and E).\n\nSo we can test three new letters.\n\nI think ""PLANE"" is a good choice: it has P, L, N.\n\nBut S is more common than P. So maybe ""SLANE""? That\'s not a word.\n\n""SHINE"": but 3rd letter is I, not A. We must have A in the 3rd and E in the 5th.\n\nSo we need a word that has A in the 3rd and E in the 5th.\n\nWords: \n- ...A..E\n\nSo the pattern is: ? ? A ? E\n\nWe can use: \n- SHAPE: S H A P E -> S, H, P\n- SHAME: S H A M E -> S, H, M\n- SHADE: S H A D E -> S, H, D\n- BLAME: B L A M E -> B, L, M\n- PLANE: P L A N E -> P, L, N\n- FLAME: F L A M E -> F, L, M (but F is less common)\n\nI think ""SHAME"" is a good option because it has S (very common) and M and H.\n\nBut let me see: we already have A and E, so we are testing S, H, M.\n\nAlternatively, ""PLANE"" tests P, L, N.\n\nI think both are reasonable. I\'ll go with ""SHAME"" because S is the most common consonant.\n\nSo my second guess: SHAME\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- S: new\n- H: new\n- A: already known, correct position\n- M: new\n- E: already known, correct position\n\nAnd we avoid C, R, T.\n\nSo <guess>shame</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":\n- C, R, and T are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- A is in the correct 3rd position (marked ""✓"").\n- E is in the correct 5th position (marked ""✓"").\n\nThis means the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A _ E`, and it **cannot** contain C, R, or T.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- I need to prioritize testing new common letters (avoiding C, R, T) in positions 1, 2, and 4.\n- I should keep A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position to maintain known correct placements.\n- Ideal letters to test include high-frequency consonants like S, L, N, M, or H, as they appear often in 5-letter words.\n\nA strong candidate is **""SHAME""**:\n- It tests S (position 1), H (position 2), and M (position 4)—all new, common letters not yet evaluated.\n- It preserves A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, T).\n\nThis guess maximizes information by covering three new high-frequency letters while building on the confirmed pattern.\n\n<guess>shame</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: shame -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crate"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n- This means:\n  - The letters C, R, T are not in the word at all.\n  - A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).\n  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).\n- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E\n\nGuess 2: ""shame"" -> Feedback: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)\n- Interpretation:\n  - S is correct and in the right position (1st).\n  - H is correct and in the right position (2nd).\n  - A is correct (3rd) as before.\n  - M is not in the word (x).\n  - E is correct (5th) as before.\n- So now we know:\n  - The first five letters are: S, H, A, ?, E\n  - The word is SHA?E\n  - M is not in the word.\n\nAdditionally, from the first guess, we know C, R, T are not in the word.\n\nSo the secret word is SHA?E, where the 4th letter is missing. We need to find a 5-letter word that fits SHA?E and the missing letter cannot be M (since M is not in the word) and cannot be C, R, T.\n\nWhat letters are possible for the 4th position?\n- Any letter except those we\'ve eliminated: C, R, T, M, and also avoiding letters already placed correctly (unless we suspect duplication, but given the feedback, we haven\'t seen repeated letters yet). Since A and E are already used and in their positions, and S and H are fixed, the 4th letter must be a new letter not yet tested.\n\nWe should consider common English letters that can fit in the 4th position to form a valid word.\n\nPossible words with the pattern SHA_E:\n- SHADE\n- SHAKE\n- SHALE\n- SHAPE\n- SHARE\n- SHAVE\n- SHAWL\n\nBut we must eliminate forbidden letters:\n- SHADE: D is not forbidden (not in C, R, T, M)\n- SHAKE: K is not forbidden\n- SHALE: L is not forbidden\n- SHAPE: P is not forbidden\n- SHARE: R is forbidden (from Guess 1), so invalid\n- SHAVE: V is not forbidden\n- SHAWL: W is not forbidden, and L is allowed\n\nAlso note the feedback: M is not in the word, so M is eliminated, which is good because SHAME is already guessed and eliminated.\n\nNow, we need to pick one of these as a guess. But note: we have only one letter to determine (the 4th), so we could guess any of these. However, we want to maximize the chance of getting it right or narrow down possibilities.\n\nBut we have 6 guesses total, and this is the third guess. If we guess wrong, we can get more feedback, so we can choose a word that tests a common letter to help with future guesses.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that might be the answer, but we have multiple options. Let me list the possibilities again:\n\nPossible words (from common words):\n- shade\n- shake\n- shale\n- shape\n- shave\n- shawl\n\nWe haven\'t tested letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z (and avoiding C,R,T,M)\n\nBut note: in ""shame"", we tested M and found it\'s not in the word. So we can avoid M.\n\nNow, among the possible words:\n- shade: uses D\n- shake: uses K\n- shale: uses L\n- shape: uses P\n- shave: uses V\n- shawl: uses W and L\n\nWe should choose a word that uses a common letter so that if it\'s wrong, we eliminate a common letter.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose the most common word or one that covers frequent letters.\n\nHowever, we have to guess one. Let\'s see the probability or commonality.\n\nWe also know that from the first guess, we tested A and E which are vowels, and now we have consonants in the 4th position.\n\nBut without more information, we can pick, say, ""SHADE"" because D is common.\n\nBut note: we want to avoid guessing a word that might contain eliminated letters? None of these have C,R,T,M.\n\nAnother idea: we can use a word that uses letters we haven\'t tested, but since we only have one position, it doesn\'t matter much.\n\nBut observe: if we guess SHADE and it\'s wrong, then D is eliminated, and we can proceed.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess SHAKE, K is eliminated if wrong.\n\nSince we have multiple possibilities, we could also choose a word that has a letter that appears in multiple options? But each word has a unique letter for the 4th position in this set, except SHAWL has W and L? Wait, SHAWL is S-H-A-W-L, so the 4th letter is W and 5th is L? No, wait the pattern is 4th letter: for SHADE: D; SHAKE: K; SHALE: L; SHAPE: P; SHAVE: V; SHAWL: W.\n\nBut note: SHAWL has L as the 5th letter? No, SHAWL is spelled S-H-A-W-L, so positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:W, 5:L. But we know the 5th letter must be E, so SHAWL is not possible! Because it ends with L, but we require E at the end.\n\nI made a mistake. The word must end with E: pattern is SHA?E, so the 5th letter is E.\n\nTherefore, re-examining:\n- SHADE: S-H-A-D-E -> yes, 4th is D\n- SHAKE: S-H-A-K-E -> yes\n- SHALE: S-H-A-L-E -> yes? Wait, SHALE: S-H-A-L-E -> 4th letter L, 5th E? No, L is the 4th letter, E is 5th. So it fits.\n  - SHALE is a word: a type of rock.\n- SHAPE: S-H-A-P-E -> 4th P, 5th E\n- SHARE: not possible due to R, and also S-H-A-R-E, but R is forbidden.\n- SHAVE: S-H-A-V-E -> 4th V\n- SHAWL: S-H-A-W-L -> but L is the 5th letter, not E, so it doesn\'t fit. Therefore, SHAWL is invalid.\n\nWhat about other words? Like SHINE? No, because 3rd letter must be A, not I.\n\nWe can consider less common words, but let\'s stick with common ones.\n\nPossible common words: SHADE, SHAKE, SHALE, SHAPE, SHAVE, and also SHIRE? But SHIRE has R which is forbidden.\n\nSHOTE? Not a common word, and T is eliminated.\n\nSo the most common ones are: SHADE, SHAKE, SHAPE, and SHAVE.\n\nNow SHALE: it\'s valid and common enough.\n\nWe have D, K, L, P, V as the options for the 4th letter.\n\nWe need to guess one. Since we don\'t have any additional information, we should pick the most frequent letter or word.\n\nBut we might also consider that from the first guess, we had A and E correct, and S and H correct, meaning the word is likely common.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that tests a letter that, if eliminated, might help with other possibilities? But they are all different.\n\nLet\'s think tactically: we have 4 guesses left and only 5-6 possibilities? Actually, that\'s manageable.\n\nWe can guess ""SHADE"" first because:\n- D is a very common letter.\n\nIf we guess ""SHADE"" and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback:\n- If D is wrong, then we know the 4th letter is not D.\n- The remaining options: SHAKE (K), SHALE (L), SHAPE (P), SHAVE (V)\n\nThen we can pick another.\n\nBut to minimize worst-case, we might pick the letter that appears in the most possibilities, but each possibility has a unique letter.\n\nAlternatively, we can pick a word that is most common. According to word lists, SHAPE, SHADE, SHAKE are all common.\n\nLet me check frequencies of the letters:\n- K is less common than D or L? Actually, D, L are more common than K, P, V.\n\nBut without specific data, I\'ll go with ""SHADE"" because it\'s straightforward.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested L. If SHADE is wrong, we still have SHALE with L, which is common.\n\nHowever, to confirm: SHALE ends with E? SHALE is S-H-A-L-E? Yes, and E is the 5th letter.\n\nSimilarly, SHAVE: S-H-A-V-E.\n\nI think I\'ll guess ""SHAPE"" because P is also common, but D is more common in 4th position? Not necessarily.\n\nGiven that L appears twice in the possible words? No, only SHALE has L. But L is a letter that might be in the word in other positions? But here we are only concerned with the 4th position.\n\nSince we have to choose, let\'s alphabetically? Or randomly? Better to pick one.\n\nI think ""shade"" is a good guess because it uses D, which we haven\'t tested, and it\'s a common word.\n\nBut to be systematic: the letter E is in the word (5th) and A is 3rd, S is 1st, H is 2nd. We know the word starts with SHA and ends with E. Common words: shade, shape, shake, shave, shale. Among these, shade and shake are very common words.\n\nBut let me count the possibilities: 5.\n\nWe can also consider if there are words with double letters, but we don\'t have evidence. For example, if the word was SHADE, then D would be the only unknown.\n\nBut given the feedback has been specific about positions, and no \'-\' for other positions, so double letters might not be present? Because in ""shame"", H and S were both correct, so no duplicate issues.\n\nI think ""shade"" is fine.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we can\'t because all known letters are fixed except one.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SHADE"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word is ""SHALE""? Then we guess SHADE, if it returns the 4th letter as \'x\', then we know D is not in it, so we can try SHALE next.\n\nBut similarly, if we guess SHALE first, same thing.\n\nTo prioritize commonality: according to some sources, SHADE is the most common of these words? But SHAPE is also common.\n\nActually, in Wordle solutions, SHADE, SHARE, SHAPE are common words, but SHARE has R which is eliminated. So SHADE and SHAPE are both possible.\n\nPerhaps ""SHAKE"" is also common.\n\nBut since we don\'t have more information, I\'ll choose ""SHADE"".\n\nSo the word to guess: SHADE\n\nIn the response format, we should output.\n\nBut note: the previous feedback didn\'t have any \'-\' symbols, meaning no misplaced letters, so the word must exactly match SHA?E and only the ? is unknown, and no other letters. So we are confident.\n\nTherefore, we can make the guess SHADE.The feedback from the previous guesses reveals the following:\n\n1. **Guess 1: ""crate"" → C(x), R(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)**:  \n   - Eliminated letters: C, R, T (not in the word).  \n   - Confirmed positions: A (3rd), E (5th).  \n   - Pattern: `_ _ A _ E`.  \n\n2. **Guess 2: ""shame"" → S(✓), H(✓), A(✓), M(x), E(✓)**:  \n   - Confirmed positions: S (1st), H (2nd), A (3rd), E (5th).  \n   - Eliminated letter: M (not in the word).  \n   - Pattern: `S H A _ E`.  \n\nThe secret word is `S H A _ E`, where the fourth letter must be a valid English letter—avoiding C, R, T (from Guess 1) and M (from Guess 2)—that forms a real 5-letter word. Possible words fitting this pattern and constraints include:  \n- **SHADE** (D), **SHAKE** (K), **SHALE** (L), **SHAPE** (P), or **SHAVE** (V).  \n\nWith no prior information about the fourth letter, I prioritize **SHADE** as the next guess because:  \n- D is a high-frequency consonant in English, and ""SHADE"" is a common word.  \n- If incorrect, the feedback on D will quickly narrow the options (to SHAKE, SHALE, SHAPE, or SHAVE) with three guesses remaining.\n\n<guess>shade</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: shame -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: shade -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crate"" -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n  - This tells us:\n    - C, R, T are not in the word.\n    - A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).\n    - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).\n  - So the word pattern is: _ _ A _ E\n\nGuess 2: ""shame"" -> S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓)\n  - This tells us:\n    - S is in the word and in the correct position (1st).\n    - H is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).\n    - A is correct (3rd) as before.\n    - M is not in the word.\n    - E is correct (5th) as before.\n  - So now the pattern is: S H A _ E\n  - And we know M is not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: ""shade"" -> S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)\n  - This tells us:\n    - S, H, A, E are in their correct positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th).\n    - D is not in the word.\n\nSo now we have:\n- The word is S H A ?

According to letter frequency, L is more common than P, K, and V.\n\nBut in the context of 5-letter words ending with ""E"", L and P are both common.\n\nWe can also think about the fact that we have 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 of 6). So we can afford to be wrong once.\n\nBut to be efficient, we can try ""shake"" because K is a letter that, if wrong, we still have two more guesses.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""shape"" because P is also common.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""shake"" as it\'s a very common word.\n\nSo the next guess: ""shake""\n\nBut let\'s confirm: \n- S, H, A, E are in the same positions, and we are testing K in the 4th.\n\nIf it\'s correct, we win.

We have the following feedback from all previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)
  - So, A is in the word at position 3, E is in the word at position 5.
  - C, R, T are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""shame"" -> S(✓), H(✓), A(✓), M(x), E(✓)
  - S is in the word at position 1, H at position 2, A at 3, E at 5.
  - M is not in the word.

Guess 3: ""shade"" -> S(✓), H(✓), A(✓), D(x), E(✓)
  - D is not in the word.

Guess 4: ""shake"" -> S(✓), H(✓), A(✓), K(x), E(✓)
  - K is not in the word.

So, the secret word is ""SHA_E"" (positions: 1=S, 2=H, 3=A, 5=E) and the 4th letter is missing.

We know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, T, M, D, K.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""SHA"" and ends with ""E"", so the pattern is ""SHA?E"".

Possible letters for the 4th position must not be any of the eliminated letters (C, R, T, M, D, K) and must form a valid English word.

Let's list possible words:

- SHALE: 4th letter L -> S H A L E
- SHAPE: 4th letter P -> S H A P E
- SHAVE: 4th letter V -> S H A V E
- SHAPE is already considered.
- What about SHARE? But R is eliminated, so no.
- SHAKE is already guessed and K is eliminated.
- SHADE is guessed and D is eliminated.

So the remaining possibilities are:
- SHALE (L)
- SHAPE (P)
- SHAVE (V)

We have three options. We need to choose one for the next guess.

We have two guesses left (since we are on guess 5 of 6). We can try one of these.

To decide, we can consider the frequency of the letters or the commonality of the words.

- L is a very common letter, and SHALE is a word (meaning a type of rock).
- P is also common, and SHAPE is a common word.
- V is less common, and SHAVE is also a common word.

Since we have no information about L, P, or V, we can choose the most common word.

In terms of word frequency, SHAPE and SHAVE are more common than SHALE.

But let's think: we can also consider that if we guess one and it's wrong, we get feedback that eliminates that letter, and then we can guess the next one.

For example, if we guess SHALE and it's wrong, then L is not in the word, so the word must be SHAPE or SHAVE. Then we can guess SHAPE next, and if wrong, then SHAVE must be the word.

Similarly, if we guess SHAPE first and it's wrong, then P is not in the word, so it must be SHALE or SHAVE. Then we can guess SHALE, etc.

But to minimize the number of guesses, we should pick the word that is most likely.

However, without knowing the word frequency in the game, we can assume SHAPE is a very common word.

Alternatively, we can pick the one that tests a letter that might be in other words, but in this case, each word has a unique letter for the 4th position.

So I think we can go with ""shape"" as it is a common word.

Therefore, the next guess is ""shape"".

But note: we have to output in the required format.

So <guess>shape</guess>

The feedback from all previous guesses confirms the secret word is **S H A _ E**, with the 4th letter missing. Eliminated letters (not in the word): **C, R, T, M, D, K**.  

The only possible valid English words fitting this pattern and constraints are:  
- **SHALE** (4th = L)  
- **SHAPE** (4th = P)  
- **SHAVE** (4th = V)  

For Guess 5, I prioritize **SHAPE** because:  
- **P** is a high-frequency consonant in English, and ""SHAPE"" is a very common word.  
- If incorrect, feedback on **P** will definitively identify the solution between SHALE (L) and SHAVE (V) on the final guess.

  - C, R, T are not in the word.
