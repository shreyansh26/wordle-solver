We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since in ""crane"", E was at the end).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Since we have only one letter that is present (E) and it's not in the 5th position, we need to make a second guess.

 We must choose a 5-letter word that:
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N (because they are not in the word).
 - Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the end and that was wrong).

 Also, we want to maximize information by including other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's think of common letters we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We know E is in the word, so we should try to put E in a different position (positions 1,2,3, or 4) and also include other common consonants.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, M, D, etc.

 We also note that the word must have an E, and we have 4 new positions to test.

 A good strategy is to try a word that has E in a different position and uses other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that has E in the first position? But note: we don't know if E can be at the beginning. However, we know it's not at the end.

 Alternatively, we can avoid the 5th position for E.

 Let me think of words that have E and do not contain C, R, A, N.

 Example: ""times"" -> but we don't know if T, I, M, S are in the word. However, we can use this.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me list some words that have E and are made of the remaining letters.

 Possibilities: 
   E in position 1: e.g., ""e"" _ _ _ _
   E in position 2: _ ""e"" _ _ _
   E in position 3: _ _ ""e"" _ _
   E in position 4: _ _ _ ""e"" _

 We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tested (so not position 5). We tested E at position 5, so we can try E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 I think a good candidate is ""SPELT"" (meaning: a type of wheat) or ""SLEPT"", but note we don't know if S, P, E, L, T are in the word.

 However, we know E is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end again, which we know is not the position for E (because in ""crane"" E was at the end and got '-', meaning it's present but not at the end). So we must avoid putting E at the end.

 So, let's avoid the 5th position for E.

 I think ""STEEL"" is not good because it has two E's and we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we want to test more letters.

 Alternatively, ""BELIE"" -> but that has E at the end? No, ""belie"" ends with E? Actually, ""belie"" is 5 letters: B-E-L-I-E -> so the last letter is E, which we want to avoid.

 How about ""MEDIA""? But we have A which we know is not in the word (from the first feedback: A is absent). So we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, C, R, N.

 So, let's try to form a word without A, C, R, N and with E not in the 5th position.

 Example: ""BELOW"" -> B, E, L, O, W. E is in the second position. This seems good.

 But note: we don't know if B, L, O, W are in the word. We are testing them.

 Another example: ""FIGHT"" -> no E, so that doesn't work.

 We must include E.

 Another: ""SPEED"" -> E at position 3 and 4? And ends with D. But we don't know if we can have two E's? We don't have information about duplicate letters. However, we know the word has at least one E.

 But to maximize information, we should use distinct letters if possible. However, ""SPEED"" has two E's and two of the same letter might not be as informative.

 How about ""SPIEL""? That's a word: S, P, I, E, L. E is in the 4th position. This avoids the 5th position and doesn't use A, C, R, N.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters.

 Alternatively, ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end, which we must avoid.

 How about ""STYLE""? S, T, Y, L, E -> again E at the end.

 We need E not at the end.

 Let me think of words with E in the middle.

 Words: 
   Position 1: EDITS, ECLAT (but ECLAT has C and A, which are absent) -> not allowed.
   Position 2: HELLO -> H, E, L, L, O -> but two L's? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, we haven't tested H, L, O.

   But we can use: ""HEIST"" -> H, E, I, S, T. E is in position 2. This seems good.

   ""HEIST"" does not contain A, C, R, N. It has H, E, I, S, T.

   Another: ""DEBIT"" -> D, E, B, I, T. E in position 2.

   ""DEBIT"" is also a valid word.

   Which one is better? Both are good. We can choose one.

   Alternatively, ""PESTO"" -> P, E, S, T, O. E in position 2.

   But note: we want to test as many common letters as possible. The letters in ""HEIST"" are H, E, I, S, T. The letters in ""DEBIT"" are D, E, B, I, T. The letters in ""PESTO"" are P, E, S, T, O.

   Since we already know E is in the word, we are testing 4 new letters in each.

   Common letters: S, T, H, I, D, B, P, O.

   I think ""HEIST"" is a good choice because it has S and T which are very common.

   But note: we are not sure if the word has H, I, S, T.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tested. We only tested E at position 5. So we can test E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   I think ""HEIST"" is a solid choice.

   However, let me check if there's a word that uses more vowels? We know the word has at least one E, but we don't know about other vowels. We haven't tested O, U, I.

   ""HEIST"" has E and I.

   Another option: ""MOUSE"" -> but E is at the end, which we avoid.

   ""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E is at position 4. This is acceptable. And it tests T, O, W, E, L.

   But we don't know if O, W, L are in the word.

   I think ""TOWEL"" is also a good candidate.

   However, we must avoid the absent letters: A, C, R, N. ""TOWEL"" does not contain these.

   But note: we are trying to find the position of E. In ""TOWEL"", E is at position 4. In ""HEIST"", E is at position 2.

   We don't have any information about the position of E, so either is fine.

   I think I'll go with ""HEIST"" because it has common letters and we can get more information.

   So, second guess: ""HEIST""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   But note: we must not use the absent letters. We are safe with H, E, I, S, T.

   Therefore, I choose ""HEIST"".

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's in the word), but **not in position 5**.
- Must **avoid** C, R, A, and N entirely.
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, H) to maximize information.

The word **""heist""** fits these criteria:
- Contains **E** in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: H, I, S, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and the incorrect E position (5th).

   E in position 3: _ _ ""e"" _ _
   E in position 4: _ _ _ ""e"" _

 We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tested (so not position 5). We tested E at position 5, so we can try E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 I think a good candidate is ""SPELT"" (meaning: a type of wheat) or ""SLEPT"", but note we don't know if S, P, E, L, T are in the word.

 However, we know E is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end again, which we know is not the position for E (because in ""crane"" E was at the end and got '-', meaning it's present but not at the end). So we must avoid putting E at the end.

 So, let's avoid the 5th position for E.

 I think ""STEEL"" is not good because it has two E's and we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we want to test more letters.

 Alternatively, ""BELIE"" -> but that has E at the end? No, ""belie"" ends with E? Actually, ""belie"" is 5 letters: B-E-L-I-E -> so the last letter is E, which we want to avoid.

 How about ""MEDIA""? But we have A which we know is not in the word (from the first feedback: A is absent). So we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, C, R, N.

 So, let's try to form a word without A, C, R, N and with E not in the 5th position.

 Example: ""BELOW"" -> B, E, L, O, W. E is in the second position. This seems good.

 But note: we don't know if B, L, O, W are in the word. We are testing them.

 Another example: ""FIGHT"" -> no E, so that doesn't work.

 We must include E.

 Another: ""SPEED"" -> E at position 3 and 4? And ends with D. But we don't know if we can have two E's? We don't have information about duplicate letters. However, we know the word has at least one E.

 But to maximize information, we should use distinct letters if possible. However, ""SPEED"" has two E's and two of the same letter might not be as informative.

 How about ""SPIEL""? That's a word: S, P, I, E, L. E is in the 4th position. This avoids the 5th position and doesn't use A, C, R, N.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters.

 Alternatively, ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end, which we must avoid.

 How about ""STYLE""? S, T, Y, L, E -> again E at the end.

 We need E not at the end.

 Let me think of words with E in the middle.

 Words: 
   Position 1: EDITS, ECLAT (but ECLAT has C and A, which are absent) -> not allowed.
   Position 2: HELLO -> H, E, L, L, O -> but two L's? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, we haven't tested H, L, O.

   But we can use: ""HEIST"" -> H, E, I, S, T. E is in position 2. This seems good.

   ""HEIST"" does not contain A, C, R, N. It has H, E, I, S, T.

   Another: ""DEBIT"" -> D, E, B, I, T. E in position 2.

   ""DEBIT"" is also a valid word.

   Which one is better? Both are good. We can choose one.

   Alternatively, ""PESTO"" -> P, E, S, T, O. E in position 2.

   But note: we want to test as many common letters as possible. The letters in ""HEIST"" are H, E, I, S, T. The letters in ""DEBIT"" are D, E, B, I, T. The letters in ""PESTO"" are P, E, S, T, O.

   Since we already know E is in the word, we are testing 4 new letters in each.

   Common letters: S, T, H, I, D, B, P, O.

   I think ""HEIST"" is a good choice because it has S and T which are very common.

   But note: we are not sure if the word has H, I, S, T.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tested. We only tested E at position 5. So we can test E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   I think ""HEIST"" is a solid choice.

   However, let me check if there's a word that uses more vowels? We know the word has at least one E, but we don't know about other vowels. We haven't tested O, U, I.

   ""HEIST"" has E and I.

   Another option: ""MOUSE"" -> but E is at the end, which we avoid.

   ""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E is at position 4. This is acceptable. And it tests T, O, W, E, L.

   But we don't know if O, W, L are in the word.

   I think ""TOWEL"" is also a good candidate.

   However, we must avoid the absent letters: A, C, R, N. ""TOWEL"" does not contain these.

   But note: we are trying to find the position of E. In ""TOWEL"", E is at position 4. In ""HEIST"", E is at position 2.

   We don't have any information about the position of E, so either is fine.

   I think I'll go with ""HEIST"" because it has common letters and we can get more information.

   So, second guess: ""HEIST""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   But note: we must not use the absent letters. We are safe with H, E, I, S, T.

   Therefore, I choose ""HEIST"".

<guess>heist</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's in the word), but **not in position 5**.
- Must **avoid** C, R, A, and N entirely.
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, H) to maximize information.

The word **""heist""** fits these criteria:
- Contains **E** in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: H, I, S, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and the incorrect E position (5th).

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, N are not in the word.
  - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""heist"" -> H(x) E(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
Meaning:
  - H, I, S, T are not in the word.
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).

From the second guess, we know that E is in position 2 (because we got a check for E at the second position).

So, the secret word has the form: _ E _ _ _

We also know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, I, S, T.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has E in the second position (since we know it's correct and fixed there).
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.
- Uses new letters to get more information.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 we've used (C,R,A,N,E,H,I,S,T) and E is fixed so we don't need to test it again, but we are including it in position 2. Actually, we have to avoid the absent letters, but E is present and fixed.

So, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.

We can use any letter except these. Also, we know E is in position 2, so we must have E in the second position.

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form: _ E _ _ _

We should try to use common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information, so we should try to use as many new common letters as possible.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ E _ _ _ and use only the available letters.

Some examples:
- ""DEUCE"" -> but E is at position 2? D E U C E -> but C is absent (from first guess) and also has E at the end which we don't know about, but we are avoiding C. So invalid because of C.
- ""BELOW"" -> B E L O W -> but we have E in position 2. And letters: B, E, L, O, W. Check absent: B is not in the absent list, L is not, O is not, W is not. So this is a candidate.
- ""BELIE"" -> B E L I E -> but I is absent (from second guess) and also has E at the end. So invalid because of I.
- ""BEVEL"" -> B E V E L -> has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. However, we are avoiding absent letters: V and L are not in the absent list. But note: we have E at the end? The pattern is _ E _ _ _, so BEVEL: position1=B, position2=E, position3=V, position4=E, position5=L. So it has E at position 2 and 4. We don't know if the word has two E's, but it's allowed. However, we are testing new letters: B, V, L. But we are repeating E, which we already know is in the word. It might be better to test all new letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible. So words without E in other positions might be better? But we don't know if there is another E.

Alternatively, we can avoid using E again to test other letters. But we have to put E in position 2.

So, the word must have E in position 2, and the other four positions should be new letters that are not absent and not E? But if the word has another E, that's okay, but we might not get information about that position.

But to maximize new information, we should try to use a word that has four new distinct letters (if possible) and no duplicates.

So, let's try to find a word of the form [letter1] E [letter2] [letter3] [letter4] where letter1, letter2, letter3, letter4 are from the available letters and distinct.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: B, D, L, M, O, P, U, Y.

Words:
- ""BEDIM"" -> B E D I M -> but I is absent (from guess2). Invalid.
- ""BEFOG"" -> B E F O G -> letters: B, F, O, G. All are available. This is a word? Yes, meaning to confuse. So: B E F O G.
- ""BEGET"" -> B E G E T -> but T is absent (from guess2). Invalid.
- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> I and N are absent. Invalid.
- ""BEVEL"" -> as above, has two E's and we are testing V and L, but we have E again. Not ideal because we are using E again which we already know.
- ""BEVY"" -> too short? 5 letters? No, BEVY is 4 letters.
- ""DEUCE"" -> invalid because of C and U? C is absent, but U is available? But C is absent so invalid.
- ""DELVE"" -> D E L V E -> again two E's. And we are testing D, L, V. But we have E at the end. We don't know if E is at the end? Actually, we know E is not at the end because in the first guess ""crane"" had E at the end and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word does not have E at the end. Therefore, we cannot have a word with E in the 5th position. So ""DELVE"" has E at the end -> invalid because we know E is not in position 5.

So we must avoid position 5 for E? Yes, because we know from the first guess that E is not in position 5. So any word that has E in position 5 is invalid for guessing because it violates the known fact.

Therefore, we must choose a word that has E in position 2 and does not have E in any other position? Not necessarily, but if we put E in position 5, we know it's wrong, so it would be a waste. But we are forced by the word choice? Actually, we can avoid words that have E in position 5.

So, back to ""BEFOG"": B E F O G -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:F, 4:O, 5:G. No E in position 5. And no absent letters. This is a valid word.

Another: ""BEMUD"" -> not a common word.

""BEPAT"" -> not a word.

""BOWEL"" -> B O W E L -> but E is in position 4? We need E in position 2. So this doesn't fit the pattern.

We need E in position 2.

Another: ""DEBAR"" -> D E B A R -> but A and R are absent. Invalid.

""DEBUG"" -> D E B U G -> letters: D, E, B, U, G. All available? D, B, U, G are not in the absent list. And no E in position 5. So ""DEBUG"" is a word (meaning to remove bugs). So: D E B U G.

But note: we are using D, B, U, G. That's four new letters.

Similarly, ""BEFOG"" uses F, O, G.

Which one is better? Both are valid.

We can also consider ""DEMOB"" -> D E M O B -> same letters as above? D, E, M, O, B. M and O are available.

But we have B and D in both? Actually, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have two candidates: ""DEBUG"" and ""BEFOG"".

""DEBUG"": tests D, B, U, G.
""BEFOG"": tests B, F, O, G.

Common letters: B and G are in both? But we are testing different sets.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should prioritize the most common letters. Common letters in English: among the available ones, B, D, F, G, L, M, O, P, U, Y.

So, ""DEBUG"" has B, D, U, G -> common letters: B, D, G, U (U is less common).
""BEFOG"" has B, F, O, G -> common letters: B, F, O, G.

F and O are quite common.

Another candidate: ""BEMIX"" -> not a word? Or ""BEMUD"" not common.

""BEGUM"" -> B E G U M -> letters: B, G, U, M. This is a word (a Muslim woman). So: B E G U M.

This tests B, G, U, M.

But we have multiple options.

We can also consider ""PEDAL"" -> P E D A L -> but A is absent. Invalid.

""LEVEL"" -> L E V E L -> has two E's and two L's? And E at the end? But we know E is not at the end. Also, we are repeating letters. Not ideal.

""JEWEL"" -> J E W E L -> again two E's and E at the end? We know E is not at the end. So invalid.

""MELEE"" -> M E L E E -> multiple E's and ends with E -> invalid.

So, let's stick with words without E in other positions and without absent letters.

Another word: ""FECAL"" -> F E C A L -> C and A are absent. Invalid.

""BEFIT"" -> B E F I T -> I and T are absent (from guess2). Invalid.

So, we have a few candidates: ""DEBUG"", ""BEFOG"", ""BEGUM"", and maybe ""DEBUT"" -> D E B U T -> but T is absent. Invalid.

""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> N is absent. Invalid.

""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> N absent.

So, ""DEBUG"" and ""BEFOG"" and ""BEGUM"" are among the few.

Another: ""BEHOW"" -> not a word.

""BEVUE"" -> not common and has E at the end.

""BEDEW"" -> B E D E W -> two E's and we don't know if there's a second E. Also, we are testing B, D, W. But we have E again. And we know E is not at the end? Position 5 is W, so that's okay. But we have E at position 4? We don't know if that's allowed. But we are trying to avoid using E again to get more new letters.

So, I think ""BEFOG"" is a good choice because it has four new letters: B, F, O, G.

Similarly, ""DEBUG"" has B, D, U, G.

But note: we are testing B in both. We don't know if B is in the word. We are testing it.

I think I'll go with ""BEFOG"" because it has O and F which are common.

But let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters.

Another word: ""BELOW"" -> B E L O W -> we considered earlier. It has E in position 2, and letters B, L, O, W. All available. And no E elsewhere. This is a good candidate.

""BELOW"" is a common word and tests B, L, O, W.

Similarly, ""MELLOW"" is 6 letters.

So, now we have:
- ""BEFOG"": B, F, O, G
- ""DEBUG"": B, D, U, G
- ""BEGUM"": B, G, U, M
- ""BELOW"": B, L, O, W

Which one to choose? We should choose the one that has the most common letters.

Common letters in English words: among the available, the frequencies: E is already known, then T is out, so next are: O, L, D, M, F, etc.

But we don't have T, so O and L are very common.

Therefore, ""BELOW"" has L and O, which are very common, and also B and W.

So, ""BELOW"" might be a better choice.

We can also consider ""MELON"" -> M E L O N -> but N is absent. Invalid.

""HELLO"" -> H is absent.

So, ""BELOW"" seems good.

But note: we must avoid the absent letters. ""BELOW"" has B, E, L, O, W. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,N,H,I,S,T). So it's valid.

Therefore, I choose ""BELOW"".

So, third guess: ""BELOW""

<guess>below</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:
- **E is confirmed in position 2** (from Guess 2: ""heist"" → E(✓)).
- The secret word has the structure: `_ E _ _ _`.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T (cannot be used).
- **E cannot be in position 5** (from Guess 1: ""crane"" → E(-)).

For the next guess:
- Must include **E in position 2**.
- Must avoid all absent letters (C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T).
- Should prioritize testing new, common letters (e.g., B, L, O, W, D, F, G, M, P, U, Y) to maximize information.

The word **""below""** fits perfectly:
- **E is in position 2** (required).
- Uses new, common letters: **B, L, O, W** (all untested and not absent).
- Avoids E in position 5 and all forbidden letters.
- Tests for potential vowels (O) and consonants (B, L, W) in unknown positions.

<guess>below</guess>",below,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, N are not in the word.
  - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""heist"" -> H(x) E(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
Meaning:
  - H, I, S, T are not in the word.
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).

From the second guess, we know that E is in position 2 (because we got a check for E at the second position).

So, the secret word has the form: _ E _ _ _

We also know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, I, S, T.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has E in the second position (since we know it's correct and fixed there).
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.
- Uses new letters to get more information.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 we've used (C,R,A,N,E,H,I,S,T) and E is fixed so we don't need to test it again, but we are including it in position 2. Actually, we have to avoid the absent letters, but E is present and fixed.

So, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.

We can use any letter except these. Also, we know E is in position 2, so we must have E in the second position.

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form: _ E _ _ _

We should try to use common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information, so we should try to use as many new common letters as possible.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ E _ _ _ and use only the available letters.

Some examples:
- ""DEUCE"" -> but E is at position 2? D E U C E -> but C is absent (from first guess) and also has E at the end which we don't know about, but we are avoiding C. So invalid because of C.
- ""BELOW"" -> B E L O W -> but we have E in position 2. And letters: B, E, L, O, W. Check absent: B is not in the absent list, L is not, O is not, W is not. So this is a candidate.
- ""BELIE"" -> B E L I E -> but I is absent (from second guess) and also has E at the end. So invalid because of I.
- ""BEVEL"" -> B E V E L -> has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. However, we are avoiding absent letters: V and L are not in the absent list. But note: we have E at the end? The pattern is _ E _ _ _, so BEVEL: position1=B, position2=E, position3=V, position4=E, position5=L. So it has E at position 2 and 4. We don't know if the word has two E's, but it's allowed. However, we are testing new letters: B, V, L. But we are repeating E, which we already know is in the word. It might be better to test all new letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible. So words without E in other positions might be better? But we don't know if there is another E.

Alternatively, we can avoid using E again to test other letters. But we have to put E in position 2.

So, the word must have E in position 2, and the other four positions should be new letters that are not absent and not E? But if the word has another E, that's okay, but we might not get information about that position.

But to maximize new information, we should try to use a word that has four new distinct letters (if possible) and no duplicates.

So, let's try to find a word of the form [letter1] E [letter2] [letter3] [letter4] where letter1, letter2, letter3, letter4 are from the available letters and distinct.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: B, D, L, M, O, P, U, Y.

Words:
- ""BEDIM"" -> B E D I M -> but I is absent (from guess2). Invalid.
- ""BEFOG"" -> B E F O G -> letters: B, F, O, G. All are available. This is a word? Yes, meaning to confuse. So: B E F O G.
- ""BEGET"" -> B E G E T -> but T is absent (from guess2). Invalid.
- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> I and N are absent. Invalid.
- ""BEVEL"" -> as above, has two E's and we are testing V and L, but we have E again. Not ideal because we are using E again which we already know.
- ""BEVY"" -> too short? 5 letters? No, BEVY is 4 letters.
- ""DEUCE"" -> invalid because of C and U? C is absent, but U is available? But C is absent so invalid.
- ""DELVE"" -> D E L V E -> again two E's. And we are testing D, L, V. But we have E at the end. We don't know if E is at the end? Actually, we know E is not at the end because in the first guess ""crane"" had E at the end and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word does not have E at the end. Therefore, we cannot have a word with E in the 5th position. So ""DELVE"" has E at the end -> invalid because we know E is not in position 5.

So we must avoid position 5 for E? Yes, because we know from the first guess that E is not in position 5. So any word that has E in position 5 is invalid for guessing because it violates the known fact.

Therefore, we must choose a word that has E in position 2 and does not have E in any other position? Not necessarily, but if we put E in position 5, we know it's wrong, so it would be a waste. But we are forced by the word choice? Actually, we can avoid words that have E in position 5.

So, back to ""BEFOG"": B E F O G -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:F, 4:O, 5:G. No E in position 5. And no absent letters. This is a valid word.

Another: ""BEMUD"" -> not a common word.

""BEPAT"" -> not a word.

""BOWEL"" -> B O W E L -> but E is in position 4? We need E in position 2. So this doesn't fit the pattern.

We need E in position 2.

Another: ""DEBAR"" -> D E B A R -> but A and R are absent. Invalid.

""DEBUG"" -> D E B U G -> letters: D, E, B, U, G. All available? D, B, U, G are not in the absent list. And no E in position 5. So ""DEBUG"" is a word (meaning to remove bugs). So: D E B U G.

But note: we are using D, B, U, G. That's four new letters.

Similarly, ""BEFOG"" uses F, O, G.

Which one is better? Both are valid.

We can also consider ""DEMOB"" -> D E M O B -> same letters as above? D, E, M, O, B. M and O are available.

But we have B and D in both? Actually, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have two candidates: ""DEBUG"" and ""BEFOG"".

""DEBUG"": tests D, B, U, G.
""BEFOG"": tests B, F, O, G.

Common letters: B and G are in both? But we are testing different sets.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should prioritize the most common letters. Common letters in English: among the available ones, B, D, F, G, L, M, O, P, U, Y.

So, ""DEBUG"" has B, D, U, G -> common letters: B, D, G, U (U is less common).
""BEFOG"" has B, F, O, G -> common letters: B, F, O, G.

F and O are quite common.

Another candidate: ""BEMIX"" -> not a word? Or ""BEMUD"" not common.

""BEGUM"" -> B E G U M -> letters: B, G, U, M. This is a word (a Muslim woman). So: B E G U M.

This tests B, G, U, M.

But we have multiple options.

We can also consider ""PEDAL"" -> P E D A L -> but A is absent. Invalid.

""LEVEL"" -> L E V E L -> has two E's and two L's? And E at the end? But we know E is not at the end. Also, we are repeating letters. Not ideal.

""JEWEL"" -> J E W E L -> again two E's and E at the end? We know E is not at the end. So invalid.

""MELEE"" -> M E L E E -> multiple E's and ends with E -> invalid.

So, let's stick with words without E in other positions and without absent letters.

Another word: ""FECAL"" -> F E C A L -> C and A are absent. Invalid.

""BEFIT"" -> B E F I T -> I and T are absent (from guess2). Invalid.

So, we have a few candidates: ""DEBUG"", ""BEFOG"", ""BEGUM"", and maybe ""DEBUT"" -> D E B U T -> but T is absent. Invalid.

""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> N is absent. Invalid.

""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> N absent.

So, ""DEBUG"" and ""BEFOG"" and ""BEGUM"" are among the few.

Another: ""BEHOW"" -> not a word.

""BEVUE"" -> not common and has E at the end.

""BEDEW"" -> B E D E W -> two E's and we don't know if there's a second E. Also, we are testing B, D, W. But we have E again. And we know E is not at the end? Position 5 is W, so that's okay. But we have E at position 4? We don't know if that's allowed. But we are trying to avoid using E again to get more new letters.

So, I think ""BEFOG"" is a good choice because it has four new letters: B, F, O, G.

Similarly, ""DEBUG"" has B, D, U, G.

But note: we are testing B in both. We don't know if B is in the word. We are testing it.

I think I'll go with ""BEFOG"" because it has O and F which are common.

But let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters.

Another word: ""BELOW"" -> B E L O W -> we considered earlier. It has E in position 2, and letters B, L, O, W. All available. And no E elsewhere. This is a good candidate.

""BELOW"" is a common word and tests B, L, O, W.

Similarly, ""MELLOW"" is 6 letters.

So, now we have:
- ""BEFOG"": B, F, O, G
- ""DEBUG"": B, D, U, G
- ""BEGUM"": B, G, U, M
- ""BELOW"": B, L, O, W

Which one to choose? We should choose the one that has the most common letters.

Common letters in English words: among the available, the frequencies: E is already known, then T is out, so next are: O, L, D, M, F, etc.

But we don't have T, so O and L are very common.

Therefore, ""BELOW"" has L and O, which are very common, and also B and W.

So, ""BELOW"" might be a better choice.

We can also consider ""MELON"" -> M E L O N -> but N is absent. Invalid.

""HELLO"" -> H is absent.

So, ""BELOW"" seems good.

But note: we must avoid the absent letters. ""BELOW"" has B, E, L, O, W. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,N,H,I,S,T). So it's valid.

Therefore, I choose ""BELOW"".

So, third guess: ""BELOW""

<guess>below</guess>After analyzing the feedback:
- **E is confirmed in position 2** (from Guess 2: ""heist"" → E(✓)).
- The secret word has the structure: `_ E _ _ _`.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T (cannot be used).

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,geeky,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since in ""crane"", E was at the end).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Since we have only one letter that is present (E) and it's not in the 5th position, we need to make a second guess.

 We must choose a 5-letter word that:
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N (because they are not in the word).
 - Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the end and that was wrong).

 Also, we want to maximize information by including other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's think of common letters we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We know E is in the word, so we should try to put E in a different position (positions 1,2,3, or 4) and also include other common consonants.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, M, D, etc.

 We also note that the word must have an E, and we have 4 new positions to test.

 A good strategy is to try a word that has E in a different position and uses other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that has E in the first position? But note: we don't know if E can be at the beginning. However, we know it's not at the end.

 Alternatively, we can avoid the 5th position for E.

 Let me think of words that have E and do not contain C, R, A, N.

 Example: ""times"" -> but we don't know if T, I, M, S are in the word. However, we can use this.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me list some words that have E and are made of the remaining letters.

 Possibilities: 
   E in position 1: e.g., ""e"" _ _ _ _
   E in position 2: _ ""e"" _ _ _
   E in position 3: _ _ ""e"" _ _
   E in position 4: _ _ _ ""e"" _

 We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tested (so not position 5). We tested E at position 5, so we can try E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 I think a good candidate is ""SPELT"" (meaning: a type of wheat) or ""SLEPT"", but note we don't know if S, P, E, L, T are in the word.

 However, we know E is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end again, which we know is not the position for E (because in ""crane"" E was at the end and got '-', meaning it's present but not at the end). So we must avoid putting E at the end.

 So, let's avoid the 5th position for E.

 I think ""STEEL"" is not good because it has two E's and we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we want to test more letters.

 Alternatively, ""BELIE"" -> but that has E at the end? No, ""belie"" ends with E? Actually, ""belie"" is 5 letters: B-E-L-I-E -> so the last letter is E, which we want to avoid.

 How about ""MEDIA""? But we have A which we know is not in the word (from the first feedback: A is absent). So we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, C, R, N.

 So, let's try to form a word without A, C, R, N and with E not in the 5th position.

 Example: ""BELOW"" -> B, E, L, O, W. E is in the second position. This seems good.

 But note: we don't know if B, L, O, W are in the word. We are testing them.

 Another example: ""FIGHT"" -> no E, so that doesn't work.

 We must include E.

 Another: ""SPEED"" -> E at position 3 and 4? And ends with D. But we don't know if we can have two E's? We don't have information about duplicate letters. However, we know the word has at least one E.

 But to maximize information, we should use distinct letters if possible. However, ""SPEED"" has two E's and two of the same letter might not be as informative.

 How about ""SPIEL""? That's a word: S, P, I, E, L. E is in the 4th position. This avoids the 5th position and doesn't use A, C, R, N.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters.

 Alternatively, ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end, which we must avoid.

 How about ""STYLE""? S, T, Y, L, E -> again E at the end.

 We need E not at the end.

 Let me think of words with E in the middle.

 Words: 
   Position 1: EDITS, ECLAT (but ECLAT has C and A, which are absent) -> not allowed.
   Position 2: HELLO -> H, E, L, L, O -> but two L's? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, we haven't tested H, L, O.

   But we can use: ""HEIST"" -> H, E, I, S, T. E is in position 2. This seems good.

   ""HEIST"" does not contain A, C, R, N. It has H, E, I, S, T.

   Another: ""DEBIT"" -> D, E, B, I, T. E in position 2.

   ""DEBIT"" is also a valid word.

   Which one is better? Both are good. We can choose one.

   Alternatively, ""PESTO"" -> P, E, S, T, O. E in position 2.

   But note: we want to test as many common letters as possible. The letters in ""HEIST"" are H, E, I, S, T. The letters in ""DEBIT"" are D, E, B, I, T. The letters in ""PESTO"" are P, E, S, T, O.

   Since we already know E is in the word, we are testing 4 new letters in each.

   Common letters: S, T, H, I, D, B, P, O.

   I think ""HEIST"" is a good choice because it has S and T which are very common.

   But note: we are not sure if the word has H, I, S, T.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tested. We only tested E at position 5. So we can test E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   I think ""HEIST"" is a solid choice.

   However, let me check if there's a word that uses more vowels? We know the word has at least one E, but we don't know about other vowels. We haven't tested O, U, I.

   ""HEIST"" has E and I.

   Another option: ""MOUSE"" -> but E is at the end, which we avoid.

   ""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E is at position 4. This is acceptable. And it tests T, O, W, E, L.

   But we don't know if O, W, L are in the word.

   I think ""TOWEL"" is also a good candidate.

   However, we must avoid the absent letters: A, C, R, N. ""TOWEL"" does not contain these.

   But note: we are trying to find the position of E. In ""TOWEL"", E is at position 4. In ""HEIST"", E is at position 2.

   We don't have any information about the position of E, so either is fine.

   I think I'll go with ""HEIST"" because it has common letters and we can get more information.

   So, second guess: ""HEIST""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   But note: we must not use the absent letters. We are safe with H, E, I, S, T.

   Therefore, I choose ""HEIST"".

<guess>heist</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's in the word), but **not in position 5**.
- Must **avoid** C, R, A, and N entirely.
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, H) to maximize information.

The word **""heist""** fits these criteria:
- Contains **E** in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: H, I, S, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and the incorrect E position (5th).

<guess>heist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: heist -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, N are not in the word.
  - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""heist"" -> H(x) E(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
Meaning:
  - H, I, S, T are not in the word.
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).

From the second guess, we know that E is in position 2 (because we got a check for E at the second position).

So, the secret word has the form: _ E _ _ _

We also know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, I, S, T.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has E in the second position (since we know it's correct and fixed there).
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.
- Uses new letters to get more information.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 we've used (C,R,A,N,E,H,I,S,T) and E is fixed so we don't need to test it again, but we are including it in position 2. Actually, we have to avoid the absent letters, but E is present and fixed.

So, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.

We can use any letter except these. Also, we know E is in position 2, so we must have E in the second position.

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form: _ E _ _ _

We should try to use common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information, so we should try to use as many new common letters as possible.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ E _ _ _ and use only the available letters.

Some examples:
- ""DEUCE"" -> but E is at position 2? D E U C E -> but C is absent (from first guess) and also has E at the end which we don't know about, but we are avoiding C. So invalid because of C.
- ""BELOW"" -> B E L O W -> but we have E in position 2. And letters: B, E, L, O, W. Check absent: B is not in the absent list, L is not, O is not, W is not. So this is a candidate.
- ""BELIE"" -> B E L I E -> but I is absent (from second guess) and also has E at the end. So invalid because of I.
- ""BEVEL"" -> B E V E L -> has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. However, we are avoiding absent letters: V and L are not in the absent list. But note: we have E at the end? The pattern is _ E _ _ _, so BEVEL: position1=B, position2=E, position3=V, position4=E, position5=L. So it has E at position 2 and 4. We don't know if the word has two E's, but it's allowed. However, we are testing new letters: B, V, L. But we are repeating E, which we already know is in the word. It might be better to test all new letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible. So words without E in other positions might be better? But we don't know if there is another E.

Alternatively, we can avoid using E again to test other letters. But we have to put E in position 2.

So, the word must have E in position 2, and the other four positions should be new letters that are not absent and not E? But if the word has another E, that's okay, but we might not get information about that position.

But to maximize new information, we should try to use a word that has four new distinct letters (if possible) and no duplicates.

So, let's try to find a word of the form [letter1] E [letter2] [letter3] [letter4] where letter1, letter2, letter3, letter4 are from the available letters and distinct.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: B, D, L, M, O, P, U, Y.

Words:
- ""BEDIM"" -> B E D I M -> but I is absent (from guess2). Invalid.
- ""BEFOG"" -> B E F O G -> letters: B, F, O, G. All are available. This is a word? Yes, meaning to confuse. So: B E F O G.
- ""BEGET"" -> B E G E T -> but T is absent (from guess2). Invalid.
- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> I and N are absent. Invalid.
- ""BEVEL"" -> as above, has two E's and we are testing V and L, but we have E again. Not ideal because we are using E again which we already know.
- ""BEVY"" -> too short? 5 letters? No, BEVY is 4 letters.
- ""DEUCE"" -> invalid because of C and U? C is absent, but U is available? But C is absent so invalid.
- ""DELVE"" -> D E L V E -> again two E's. And we are testing D, L, V. But we have E at the end. We don't know if E is at the end? Actually, we know E is not at the end because in the first guess ""crane"" had E at the end and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word does not have E at the end. Therefore, we cannot have a word with E in the 5th position. So ""DELVE"" has E at the end -> invalid because we know E is not in position 5.

So we must avoid position 5 for E? Yes, because we know from the first guess that E is not in position 5. So any word that has E in position 5 is invalid for guessing because it violates the known fact.

Therefore, we must choose a word that has E in position 2 and does not have E in any other position? Not necessarily, but if we put E in position 5, we know it's wrong, so it would be a waste. But we are forced by the word choice? Actually, we can avoid words that have E in position 5.

So, back to ""BEFOG"": B E F O G -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:F, 4:O, 5:G. No E in position 5. And no absent letters. This is a valid word.

Another: ""BEMUD"" -> not a common word.

""BEPAT"" -> not a word.

""BOWEL"" -> B O W E L -> but E is in position 4? We need E in position 2. So this doesn't fit the pattern.

We need E in position 2.

Another: ""DEBAR"" -> D E B A R -> but A and R are absent. Invalid.

""DEBUG"" -> D E B U G -> letters: D, E, B, U, G. All available? D, B, U, G are not in the absent list. And no E in position 5. So ""DEBUG"" is a word (meaning to remove bugs). So: D E B U G.

But note: we are using D, B, U, G. That's four new letters.

Similarly, ""BEFOG"" uses F, O, G.

Which one is better? Both are valid.

We can also consider ""DEMOB"" -> D E M O B -> same letters as above? D, E, M, O, B. M and O are available.

But we have B and D in both? Actually, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have two candidates: ""DEBUG"" and ""BEFOG"".

""DEBUG"": tests D, B, U, G.
""BEFOG"": tests B, F, O, G.

Common letters: B and G are in both? But we are testing different sets.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should prioritize the most common letters. Common letters in English: among the available ones, B, D, F, G, L, M, O, P, U, Y.

So, ""DEBUG"" has B, D, U, G -> common letters: B, D, G, U (U is less common).
""BEFOG"" has B, F, O, G -> common letters: B, F, O, G.

F and O are quite common.

Another candidate: ""BEMIX"" -> not a word? Or ""BEMUD"" not common.

""BEGUM"" -> B E G U M -> letters: B, G, U, M. This is a word (a Muslim woman). So: B E G U M.

This tests B, G, U, M.

But we have multiple options.

We can also consider ""PEDAL"" -> P E D A L -> but A is absent. Invalid.

""LEVEL"" -> L E V E L -> has two E's and two L's? And E at the end? But we know E is not at the end. Also, we are repeating letters. Not ideal.

""JEWEL"" -> J E W E L -> again two E's and E at the end? We know E is not at the end. So invalid.

""MELEE"" -> M E L E E -> multiple E's and ends with E -> invalid.

So, let's stick with words without E in other positions and without absent letters.

Another word: ""FECAL"" -> F E C A L -> C and A are absent. Invalid.

""BEFIT"" -> B E F I T -> I and T are absent (from guess2). Invalid.

So, we have a few candidates: ""DEBUG"", ""BEFOG"", ""BEGUM"", and maybe ""DEBUT"" -> D E B U T -> but T is absent. Invalid.

""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> N is absent. Invalid.

""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> N absent.

So, ""DEBUG"" and ""BEFOG"" and ""BEGUM"" are among the few.

Another: ""BEHOW"" -> not a word.

""BEVUE"" -> not common and has E at the end.

""BEDEW"" -> B E D E W -> two E's and we don't know if there's a second E. Also, we are testing B, D, W. But we have E again. And we know E is not at the end? Position 5 is W, so that's okay. But we have E at position 4? We don't know if that's allowed. But we are trying to avoid using E again to get more new letters.

So, I think ""BEFOG"" is a good choice because it has four new letters: B, F, O, G.

Similarly, ""DEBUG"" has B, D, U, G.

But note: we are testing B in both. We don't know if B is in the word. We are testing it.

I think I'll go with ""BEFOG"" because it has O and F which are common.

But let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters.

Another word: ""BELOW"" -> B E L O W -> we considered earlier. It has E in position 2, and letters B, L, O, W. All available. And no E elsewhere. This is a good candidate.

""BELOW"" is a common word and tests B, L, O, W.

Similarly, ""MELLOW"" is 6 letters.

So, now we have:
- ""BEFOG"": B, F, O, G
- ""DEBUG"": B, D, U, G
- ""BEGUM"": B, G, U, M
- ""BELOW"": B, L, O, W

Which one to choose? We should choose the one that has the most common letters.

Common letters in English words: among the available, the frequencies: E is already known, then T is out, so next are: O, L, D, M, F, etc.

But we don't have T, so O and L are very common.

Therefore, ""BELOW"" has L and O, which are very common, and also B and W.

So, ""BELOW"" might be a better choice.

We can also consider ""MELON"" -> M E L O N -> but N is absent. Invalid.

""HELLO"" -> H is absent.

So, ""BELOW"" seems good.

But note: we must avoid the absent letters. ""BELOW"" has B, E, L, O, W. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,N,H,I,S,T). So it's valid.

Therefore, I choose ""BELOW"".

So, third guess: ""BELOW""

<guess>below</guess>After analyzing the feedback:
- **E is confirmed in position 2** (from Guess 2: ""heist"" → E(✓)).
- The secret word has the structure: `_ E _ _ _`.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T (cannot be used).
- **E cannot be in position 5** (from Guess 1: ""crane"" → E(-)).

For the next guess:
- Must include **E in position 2**.
- Must avoid all absent letters (C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T).
- Should prioritize testing new, common letters (e.g., B, L, O, W, D, F, G, M, P, U, Y) to maximize information.

The word **""below""** fits perfectly:
- **E is in position 2** (required).
- Uses new, common letters: **B, L, O, W** (all untested and not absent).
- Avoids E in position 5 and all forbidden letters.
- Tests for potential vowels (O) and consonants (B, L, W) in unknown positions.

But note: we don\'t know if E can be at the beginning. However, we know it\'s not at the end.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid the 5th position for E.\n\n Let me think of words that have E and do not contain C, R, A, N.\n\n Example: ""times"" -> but we don\'t know if T, I, M, S are in the word. However, we can use this.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.\n\n Let me list some words that have E and are made of the remaining letters.\n\n Possibilities: \n   E in position 1: e.g., ""e"" _ _ _ _\n   E in position 2: _ ""e"" _ _ _\n   E in position 3: _ _ ""e"" _ _\n   E in position 4: _ _ _ ""e"" _\n\n We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has E in a position we haven\'t tested (so not position 5). We tested E at position 5, so we can try E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n I think a good candidate is ""SPELT"" (meaning: a type of wheat) or ""SLEPT"", but note we don\'t know if S, P, E, L, T are in the word.\n\n However, we know E is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position.\n\n Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end again, which we know is not the position for E (because in ""crane"" E was at the end and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not at the end). So we must avoid putting E at the end.\n\n So, let\'s avoid the 5th position for E.\n\n I think ""STEEL"" is not good because it has two E\'s and we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we want to test more letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""BELIE"" -> but that has E at the end? No, ""belie"" ends with E? Actually, ""belie"" is 5 letters: B-E-L-I-E -> so the last letter is E, which we want to avoid.\n\n How about ""MEDIA""? But we have A which we know is not in the word (from the first feedback: A is absent). So we cannot use A.\n\n We must avoid A, C, R, N.\n\n So, let\'s try to form a word without A, C, R, N and with E not in the 5th position.\n\n Example: ""BELOW"" -> B, E, L, O, W. E is in the second position. This seems good.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if B, L, O, W are in the word. We are testing them.\n\n Another example: ""FIGHT"" -> no E, so that doesn\'t work.\n\n We must include E.\n\n Another: ""SPEED"" -> E at position 3 and 4? And ends with D. But we don\'t know if we can have two E\'s? We don\'t have information about duplicate letters. However, we know the word has at least one E.\n\n But to maximize information, we should use distinct letters if possible. However, ""SPEED"" has two E\'s and two of the same letter might not be as informative.\n\n How about ""SPIEL""? That\'s a word: S, P, I, E, L. E is in the 4th position. This avoids the 5th position and doesn\'t use A, C, R, N.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the absent letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end, which we must avoid.\n\n How about ""STYLE""? S, T, Y, L, E -> again E at the end.\n\n We need E not at the end.\n\n Let me think of words with E in the middle.\n\n Words: \n   Position 1: EDITS, ECLAT (but ECLAT has C and A, which are absent) -> not allowed.\n   Position 2: HELLO -> H, E, L, L, O -> but two L\'s? And we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we haven\'t tested H, L, O.\n\n   But we can use: ""HEIST"" -> H, E, I, S, T. E is in position 2. This seems good.\n\n   ""HEIST"" does not contain A, C, R, N. It has H, E, I, S, T.\n\n   Another: ""DEBIT"" -> D, E, B, I, T. E in position 2.\n\n   ""DEBIT"" is also a valid word.\n\n   Which one is better? Both are good. We can choose one.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PESTO"" -> P, E, S, T, O. E in position 2.\n\n   But note: we want to test as many common letters as possible. The letters in ""HEIST"" are H, E, I, S, T. The letters in ""DEBIT"" are D, E, B, I, T. The letters in ""PESTO"" are P, E, S, T, O.\n\n   Since we already know E is in the word, we are testing 4 new letters in each.\n\n   Common letters: S, T, H, I, D, B, P, O.\n\n   I think ""HEIST"" is a good choice because it has S and T which are very common.\n\n   But note: we are not sure if the word has H, I, S, T.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven\'t tested. We only tested E at position 5. So we can test E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n   I think ""HEIST"" is a solid choice.\n\n   However, let me check if there\'s a word that uses more vowels? We know the word has at least one E, but we don\'t know about other vowels. We haven\'t tested O, U, I.\n\n   ""HEIST"" has E and I.\n\n   Another option: ""MOUSE"" -> but E is at the end, which we avoid.\n\n   ""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E is at position 4. This is acceptable. And it tests T, O, W, E, L.\n\n   But we don\'t know if O, W, L are in the word.\n\n   I think ""TOWEL"" is also a good candidate.\n\n   However, we must avoid the absent letters: A, C, R, N. ""TOWEL"" does not contain these.\n\n   But note: we are trying to find the position of E. In ""TOWEL"", E is at position 4. In ""HEIST"", E is at position 2.\n\n   We don\'t have any information about the position of E, so either is fine.\n\n   I think I\'ll go with ""HEIST"" because it has common letters and we can get more information.\n\n   So, second guess: ""HEIST""\n\n   We\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\n   But note: we must not use the absent letters. We are safe with H, E, I, S, T.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""HEIST"".\n\n<guess>heist</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E** (since it\'s in the word), but **not in position 5**.\n- Must **avoid** C, R, A, and N entirely.\n- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, H) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""heist""** fits these criteria:\n- Contains **E** in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: H, I, S, T.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and the incorrect E position (5th).\n\n<guess>heist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: heist -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n  - C, R, A, N are not in the word.\n  - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nGuess 2: ""heist"" -> H(x) E(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)\nMeaning:\n  - H, I, S, T are not in the word.\n  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n\nFrom the second guess, we know that E is in position 2 (because we got a check for E at the second position).\n\nSo, the secret word has the form: _ E _ _ _\n\nWe also know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, I, S, T.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Has E in the second position (since we know it\'s correct and fixed there).\n- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.\n- Uses new letters to get more information.\n\nAvailable letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 we\'ve used (C,R,A,N,E,H,I,S,T) and E is fixed so we don\'t need to test it again, but we are including it in position 2. Actually, we have to avoid the absent letters, but E is present and fixed.\n\nSo, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.\n\nWe can use any letter except these. Also, we know E is in position 2, so we must have E in the second position.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word of the form: _ E _ _ _\n\nWe should try to use common letters that we haven\'t tested yet, such as: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to maximize information, so we should try to use as many new common letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern _ E _ _ _ and use only the available letters.\n\nSome examples:\n- ""DEUCE"" -> but E is at position 2? D E U C E -> but C is absent (from first guess) and also has E at the end which we don\'t know about, but we are avoiding C. So invalid because of C.\n- ""BELOW"" -> B E L O W -> but we have E in position 2. And letters: B, E, L, O, W. Check absent: B is not in the absent list, L is not, O is not, W is not. So this is a candidate.\n- ""BELIE"" -> B E L I E -> but I is absent (from second guess) and also has E at the end. So invalid because of I.\n- ""BEVEL"" -> B E V E L -> has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. However, we are avoiding absent letters: V and L are not in the absent list. But note: we have E at the end? The pattern is _ E _ _ _, so BEVEL: position1=B, position2=E, position3=V, position4=E, position5=L. So it has E at position 2 and 4. We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s, but it\'s allowed. However, we are testing new letters: B, V, L. But we are repeating E, which we already know is in the word. It might be better to test all new letters.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible. So words without E in other positions might be better? But we don\'t know if there is another E.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid using E again to test other letters. But we have to put E in position 2.\n\nSo, the word must have E in position 2, and the other four positions should be new letters that are not absent and not E? But if the word has another E, that\'s okay, but we might not get information about that position.\n\nBut to maximize new information, we should try to use a word that has four new distinct letters (if possible) and no duplicates.\n\nSo, let\'s try to find a word of the form [letter1] E [letter2] [letter3] [letter4] where letter1, letter2, letter3, letter4 are from the available letters and distinct.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon letters: B, D, L, M, O, P, U, Y.\n\nWords:\n- ""BEDIM"" -> B E D I M -> but I is absent (from guess2). Invalid.\n- ""BEFOG"" -> B E F O G -> letters: B, F, O, G. All are available. This is a word? Yes, meaning to confuse. So: B E F O G.\n- ""BEGET"" -> B E G E T -> but T is absent (from guess2). Invalid.\n- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> I and N are absent. Invalid.\n- ""BEVEL"" -> as above, has two E\'s and we are testing V and L, but we have E again. Not ideal because we are using E again which we already know.\n- ""BEVY"" -> too short? 5 letters? No, BEVY is 4 letters.\n- ""DEUCE"" -> invalid because of C and U? C is absent, but U is available? But C is absent so invalid.\n- ""DELVE"" -> D E L V E -> again two E\'s. And we are testing D, L, V. But we have E at the end. We don\'t know if E is at the end? Actually, we know E is not at the end because in the first guess ""crane"" had E at the end and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word does not have E at the end. Therefore, we cannot have a word with E in the 5th position. So ""DELVE"" has E at the end -> invalid because we know E is not in position 5.\n\nSo we must avoid position 5 for E? Yes, because we know from the first guess that E is not in position 5. So any word that has E in position 5 is invalid for guessing because it violates the known fact.\n\nTherefore, we must choose a word that has E in position 2 and does not have E in any other position? Not necessarily, but if we put E in position 5, we know it\'s wrong, so it would be a waste. But we are forced by the word choice? Actually, we can avoid words that have E in position 5.\n\nSo, back to ""BEFOG"": B E F O G -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:F, 4:O, 5:G. No E in position 5. And no absent letters. This is a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""BEMUD"" -> not a common word.\n\n""BEPAT"" -> not a word.\n\n""BOWEL"" -> B O W E L -> but E is in position 4? We need E in position 2. So this doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nWe need E in position 2.\n\nAnother: ""DEBAR"" -> D E B A R -> but A and R are absent. Invalid.\n\n""DEBUG"" -> D E B U G -> letters: D, E, B, U, G. All available? D, B, U, G are not in the absent list. And no E in position 5. So ""DEBUG"" is a word (meaning to remove bugs). So: D E B U G.\n\nBut note: we are using D, B, U, G. That\'s four new letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""BEFOG"" uses F, O, G.\n\nWhich one is better? Both are valid.\n\nWe can also consider ""DEMOB"" -> D E M O B -> same letters as above? D, E, M, O, B. M and O are available.\n\nBut we have B and D in both? Actually, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe have two candidates: ""DEBUG"" and ""BEFOG"".\n\n""DEBUG"": tests D, B, U, G.\n""BEFOG"": tests B, F, O, G.\n\nCommon letters: B and G are in both? But we are testing different sets.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should prioritize the most common letters. Common letters in English: among the available ones, B, D, F, G, L, M, O, P, U, Y.\n\nSo, ""DEBUG"" has B, D, U, G -> common letters: B, D, G, U (U is less common).\n""BEFOG"" has B, F, O, G -> common letters: B, F, O, G.\n\nF and O are quite common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BEMIX"" -> not a word? Or ""BEMUD"" not common.\n\n""BEGUM"" -> B E G U M -> letters: B, G, U, M. This is a word (a Muslim woman). So: B E G U M.\n\nThis tests B, G, U, M.\n\nBut we have multiple options.\n\nWe can also consider ""PEDAL"" -> P E D A L -> but A is absent. Invalid.\n\n""LEVEL"" -> L E V E L -> has two E\'s and two L\'s? And E at the end? But we know E is not at the end. Also, we are repeating letters. Not ideal.\n\n""JEWEL"" -> J E W E L -> again two E\'s and E at the end? We know E is not at the end. So invalid.\n\n""MELEE"" -> M E L E E -> multiple E\'s and ends with E -> invalid.\n\nSo, let\'s stick with words without E in other positions and without absent letters.\n\nAnother word: ""FECAL"" -> F E C A L -> C and A are absent. Invalid.\n\n""BEFIT"" -> B E F I T -> I and T are absent (from guess2). Invalid.\n\nSo, we have a few candidates: ""DEBUG"", ""BEFOG"", ""BEGUM"", and maybe ""DEBUT"" -> D E B U T -> but T is absent. Invalid.\n\n""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> N is absent. Invalid.\n\n""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> N absent.\n\nSo, ""DEBUG"" and ""BEFOG"" and ""BEGUM"" are among the few.\n\nAnother: ""BEHOW"" -> not a word.\n\n""BEVUE"" -> not common and has E at the end.\n\n""BEDEW"" -> B E D E W -> two E\'s and we don\'t know if there\'s a second E. Also, we are testing B, D, W. But we have E again. And we know E is not at the end? Position 5 is W, so that\'s okay. But we have E at position 4? We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. But we are trying to avoid using E again to get more new letters.\n\nSo, I think ""BEFOG"" is a good choice because it has four new letters: B, F, O, G.\n\nSimilarly, ""DEBUG"" has B, D, U, G.\n\nBut note: we are testing B in both. We don\'t know if B is in the word. We are testing it.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""BEFOG"" because it has O and F which are common.\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that uses more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""BELOW"" -> B E L O W -> we considered earlier. It has E in position 2, and letters B, L, O, W. All available. And no E elsewhere. This is a good candidate.\n\n""BELOW"" is a common word and tests B, L, O, W.\n\nSimilarly, ""MELLOW"" is 6 letters.\n\nSo, now we have:\n- ""BEFOG"": B, F, O, G\n- ""DEBUG"": B, D, U, G\n- ""BEGUM"": B, G, U, M\n- ""BELOW"": B, L, O, W\n\nWhich one to choose? We should choose the one that has the most common letters.\n\nCommon letters in English words: among the available, the frequencies: E is already known, then T is out, so next are: O, L, D, M, F, etc.\n\nBut we don\'t have T, so O and L are very common.\n\nTherefore, ""BELOW"" has L and O, which are very common, and also B and W.\n\nSo, ""BELOW"" might be a better choice.\n\nWe can also consider ""MELON"" -> M E L O N -> but N is absent. Invalid.\n\n""HELLO"" -> H is absent.\n\nSo, ""BELOW"" seems good.\n\nBut note: we must avoid the absent letters. ""BELOW"" has B, E, L, O, W. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,N,H,I,S,T). So it\'s valid.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""BELOW"".\n\nSo, third guess: ""BELOW""\n\n<guess>below</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n- **E is confirmed in position 2** (from Guess 2: ""heist"" → E(✓)).\n- The secret word has the structure: `_ E _ _ _`.\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T (cannot be used).\n- **E cannot be in position 5** (from Guess 1: ""crane"" → E(-)).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E in position 2**.\n- Must avoid all absent letters (C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T).\n- Should prioritize testing new, common letters (e.g., B, L, O, W, D, F, G, M, P, U, Y) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""below""** fits perfectly:\n- **E is in position 2** (required).\n- Uses new, common letters: **B, L, O, W** (all untested and not absent).\n- Avoids E in position 5 and all forbidden letters.\n- Tests for potential vowels (O) and consonants (B, L, W) in unknown positions.\n\n<guess>below</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: heist -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - So, E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""heist"" -> H(x), E(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).

Guess 3: ""below"" -> B(x), E(✓), L(x), O(x), W(x)
  - E is again correct in position 2 (as expected), and B, L, O, W are not in the word.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word is of the form: _ E _ _ _ (since E is fixed at position 2).
- Absent letters (not in the word at all): C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T, B, L, O, W.

Thus, the letters we cannot use are: A, B, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, W.

We have used 11 letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, I, S, T, B, L, O, W (E is present, but the rest are absent).

Available letters: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: we know E is in the word and fixed at position 2, so we only need to fill the other four positions with letters from the available list, but we must also remember that E might be the only vowel? However, we don't know that. The word could have other vowels that we haven't tested? We've tested A, I, O and they are absent. Vowels in English: A, E, I, O, U. We know:
- A, I, O are absent (from feedback).
- E is present.
- U is still unknown (and available).

So, the word must contain at least E (and possibly U or other vowels? But we've tested A, I, O and they are not in the word. So the remaining vowel is U? Or Y? Since Y can sometimes be a vowel.

Therefore, the secret word must have E and either U or Y (or possibly no other vowels if the other letters are consonants? But every word must have a vowel? Not necessarily, but typically. We have E, so that might be enough? But we have to form a valid English word.

Structure: _ E _ _ _

The positions 1, 3, 4, 5 must be filled with letters from: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We also know that E is not in position 5, which is already satisfied.

Given that many common letters are used up, we need to choose a word that uses available letters.

Possible words:
- We need to consider that U might be important.

List of candidate words that are 5 letters, start with E in the second position, and use only available letters.

Examples:
- ""DEBUG"" was a candidate but B is absent? Wait, from guess3, B is absent. So we cannot use B.

We must avoid all absent letters: A, B, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, W.

So, available: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Now, words:
- ""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> but O and N are absent (N from guess1, O from guess3). So invalid.
- ""FEUED"" -> F E U E D -> has two E's? and E is in position 4? We know E is not in position 5, but we don't know about position 4. However, the word must be _ E _ _ _ so positions: 1=F, 2=E, 3=U, 4=E, 5=D. But we already know E is only in position 2? Wait, no, the feedback told us E is in the word and in position 2, but there could be more E's? However, in guess1, E was marked present but wrong position (so if there was another E in position 5, it would have been marked absent? but it was marked with '-' meaning present but wrong position. Since position 5 was wrong, and we now have E fixed at 2, it is possible that there is another E elsewhere? But in guess1, ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. That E could be at another position. But we now know position 2 is E, so the E in guess1 could be the same E? But then why was it marked as '-'? Because it was at the wrong position, and position 2 was not guessed then.

Actually, the E at position 5 in guess1 and the E at position 2 are the same? Not necessarily, the word could have two E's. But we don't have information on that.

In guess2, we got E at position 2 correct, and no other letters were marked present. Similarly in guess3, only E was correct. So it's possible the word has only one E? Or more? We don't know.

So, we should allow for the possibility of another E? But we are trying to get new information, so it might be inefficient to guess a letter we already know is present? But if there is another E, we need to find its position.

However, we know that position 5 cannot be E? Actually, from guess1: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position. So the E at position 5 is not correct, meaning the word does have another E or the same E? Wait, but if the word has E at position 2, then guess1's E at position 5 was correctly identified as present (because E is in the word) but in the wrong position (because it's at position 5 but should be at position 2). So if there's only one E, the '-' in guess1 indicates that E is not in position 5. But if there were two E's, then even if position 5 has E, it would be correct? No, because if the word has E at position 5 and E at position 2, then in guess1 ""crane"" with E at position 5 would get a '-' if position 5 is not the only position for E? Actually, the feedback marks each letter individually. So for the E at position 5 in ""crane"", if the word has E at position 5, it would have been marked with '✓'. But it was marked with '-', meaning that E is in the word but not in position 5. So regardless of whether there is another E or not, position 5 is not E.

Therefore, we know:
- Position 5 ≠ E.
- Position 2 = E.

So, if we want to include another E in our guess, it must be in positions 3 or 4? But we don't know if that E exists.

But to be efficient, we should avoid repeating E? Because testing new letters is more informative.

So, we are looking for a word with E in position 2 and other positions having letters from the available set, without E elsewhere.

So, pattern: [not E or absent] E [not E or absent] [not E or absent] [not E or absent]

And all letters from: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (and we must avoid absent letters).

Let me try to find words that fit.

Common words:
- ""DEPTH"" -> D E P T H -> but T and H are absent (from guess2). Invalid.
- ""DELVE"" -> D E L V E -> L is absent (from guess3) and also has E at the end? But we know position 5 cannot be E, so it would be incorrect, but also L is absent. Invalid.
- ""DEFER"" -> D E F E R -> but R is absent (from guess1) and also repeated E.
- ""DEUCE"" -> D E U C E -> C is absent (from guess1) and has E at end? Invalid.
- ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> I and N absent.
- ""DEMUR"" -> D E M U R -> R absent.
- ""DEVIL"" -> D E V I L -> I and L absent.

We are having a problem because many words use I, O, etc. which are absent.

Let's think of words with only the available letters and no absent ones.

Possible words:
- ""DECKED"" -> too long? 6 letters. We need 5.

What about ""DEUCE"" already invalid.

""JEWEL"" -> J E W E L -> but W and L are absent? W absent from guess3, L from guess3. Invalid.

""MEADOW"" -> M E A D O W -> A and O and W absent? A from guess1, O from guess3, W from guess3. Invalid.

""MEDIA"" -> M E D I A -> I and A absent. Invalid.

It seems we must consider less common words.

What about ""DUMKY"" -> is this a word? Not really.

""UMPED"" -> U M P E D -> E is at position 4? Pattern: U M P E D -> positions: 1=U, 2=E? We need position 2=E, so not.

Pattern must be: position1: any available letter, position2=E, position3: available, position4: available, position5: available.

So, let's look for words with E in the second position and the other letters from: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

And these words must be valid English words.

Examples:
- ""KEVEL"" -> K E V E L -> L absent? L is absent. And also two E's? But L is absent from guess3.

So, invalid.

""PECID"" -> not a word.

""PEWED"" -> P E W E D -> W absent? From guess3, W is absent. Invalid.

""VEXED"" -> V E X E D -> two E's? and E at position 4? So, positions: 1=V, 2=E, 3=X, 4=E, 5=D. This has E at position 4. Also, V, X, D are available? Check: V not absent, X not absent, D not absent. So, this is a valid word? Yes, ""vexed"" meaning annoyed.

But we have E at position 2 and also position 4. We don't know if the word has two E's? But we are testing it.

However, we are using E twice, which means we are only testing three new letters: V, X, D.

Alternatively, we can try to avoid E to get more new letters.

Another candidate: ""DUVET"" -> D U V E T -> but E is at position 4? We need E at position 2: the pattern must be _ E _ _ _. So ""DUVET"" is D U V E T -> positions: 1=D, 2=U, 3=V, 4=E, 5=T -> no E at position 2. So not matching.

We need E at position 2.

Another try: ""VEZIR"" -> not common.

""YUZUS"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""QUEME"" -> Q U E M E -> but E at position 3 and 5? We need E at position 2.

Not.

""JEMBE"" -> J E M B E -> but B is absent. And two E's.

Invalid because B absent.

""MADGE"" -> M A D G E -> A absent.

""PYGMY"" -> P Y G M Y -> no E? Cannot.

I think it's tough. Another option: ""FEMUR"" -> F E M U R -> R is absent. Invalid.

But we found ""vexed"": V E X E D.

But ""vexed"" uses W? No, V E X E D: letters V, E, X, D.

All are available (not in the absent list).

So, we can use ""vexed"".

But we are repeating E, not ideal for information.

Another candidate: ""DEKKO"" -> not standard.

""PERCE?"" Not.

""PEKED"" -> P E K E D -> two E's, and P, K, D are available? P, K, D not absent. So ""peked"" might be a word? Meaning (peke is a dog, but ""peked"" as adjective? not common).

""GEMMY"" -> G E M M Y -> two M's? but pattern: G E M M Y -> E at position 2, but not E elsewhere.

Letters: G, E, M, Y.

All available.

And it's a valid word (like gemmy means full of gems or something).

Similarly, ""MEM"" is not 5 letters.

Another one: ""KEMP"" not 5.

So, ""gemmy"" is G E M M Y -> positions: 1=G, 2=E, 3=M, 4=M, 5=Y.

We are testing G, M, Y? But M is repeated, so we test G, M, Y.

Or ""jemmy"" which is J E M M Y -> but J E M M Y is a word (meaning a crowbar or something).

""jemmy"" has J, E, M, Y.

J is available? Yes.

But we haven't tested J.

However, repeated M? But still, we are testing three new letters.

But we are not testing any potential vowels? We suspect U might be in the word? We don't know.

Another word: ""DEBUG"" but B is absent.

""DEKKO"" not common.

Perhaps ""DEFY"" is 4 letters.

""JUPON"" -> J U P O N -> O and N absent? O from guess3, N from guess1.

Invalid.

I think ""vexed"" V E X E D and ""gemmy"" G E M M Y or ""jemmy"" J E M M Y are options, but they have duplicate letters.

Another one: ""VEZIR"" as ""MEZER"" not common.

""DEIFY"" -> D E I F Y -> but I is absent? From guess2.

Invalid.

""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> O and N absent.

So, alternative: ""VEGAN"" -> V E G A N -> A and N absent.

Invalid.

Perhaps we must consider that the word might have U.

Word: ""MUCID"" -> M U C I D -> C and I absent. No E at position 2.

Not.

We need E at position 2, so let's think of words like:

- U E _ _ _ : like ""UEL-? "" not common.

- P E _ _ _ : ""PEGGY"" -> P E G G Y -> G repeated? Not.

""PUPED"" -> P E? P U P E D -> no.

I think ""vexed"" is a reasonable choice.

Or perhaps ""JEEZE"" -> J E E Z E -> too many E's.

We need to accept that we might have to use a word with repeated letters or with E again.

But let's try to find a word without E in other positions.

For example, ""DEWX?"" not a word.

""GEMEL"" -> G E M E L -> L is absent? And has E at position 4.

But L absent, so invalid.

""FEDER"" -> F E D E R -> R absent.

""DEMIT"" -> D E M I T -> I and T absent.

""KEYED"" -> K E Y E D -> has E at position 2 and 4? And D. But Y and K are available. So ""KEYED"" K E Y E D.

Letters: K, E, Y, D.

Y and D are available? Yes.

K is available? Yes.

But two E's? Yes.

But we are testing K, Y, D.

Positions: 1=K, 2=E, 3=Y, 4=E, 5=D.

However, we know position 5 cannot be E? We have E at position 4, which is not position 5, so that's allowed? But we are guessing E at position 4, which is not position 5. So it's valid.

But will we get separate feedback for each E? Yes.

But we are using two E's, so we might be not testing as many new letters.

Another option: ""HEEDS"" -> but H absent.

""DEEMS"" -> S absent.

""VEKKER"" not 5.

Perhaps ""QUEUE"" -> Q U E U E -> E at position 3? _ E _ _ _ not matched.

We need E at position 2.

So, I think ""KEYED"" is a word? Yes, meaning to have provided with keys or operated by keys.

And it fits: K E Y E D.

Another: ""JEYED"" -> not common.

Or ""PEEBY"" -> P E E B Y -> B is absent.

So, ""KEYED"" is K E Y E D.

Tested letters: K, Y, D (and E twice).

Similarly, ""VEXED"" V E X E D.

Between ""KEYED"" and ""VEXED"", we can choose one.

Or without E duplicate?

Let's search for a word with four new letters and no E elsewhere.

What about ""DUXE D "" D U X E D -> no E at position 2.

How about ""PEG UN"" not a word.

""GUD GE"" not.

""DUMPY"" -> D U M P Y -> no E, not applicable.

We must have E at position 2.

The only words I can think of without using absent letters and without E duplicate are few.

For example:
- ""DEXES"" -> D E X E S -> S absent? S absent from guess2.

In ""DEXES"", S is at the end? S? But S is absent, so invalid.

""FEEZE"" -> F E E Z E -> two E's.

"" JEEPS"" -> J E E P S? S absent.

""MYKT E"" not.

Perhaps ""QUEY?"" Q U E Y -> 4 letters.

I think it's hard to find, so maybe we should go with a word that has E only at position 2 and the letter U in one of the position.

For example, ""DEBUS"" -> D E B U S -> B and S absent. Invalid.

""DEPUD"" not a word.

""EMEU"" not 5.

We might have to use ""vexed"".

Another common word: ""bevel"" but B and L absent.

So, let's go with ""VEXED"" or ""KEYED"".

Or ""GEMUL"" not a word.

Let's choose ""KEYED"": K E Y E D.

But we are repeating E, which might not give us new information. However, we might discover if there is an E at position 4.

But we know from guess1 that E is not at position 5, but position 4 is possible.

Similarly, position 3 is possible.

So, we can gain position information for E.

But we already know E is at position 2, and if we get a '-' for position 4 E, then we know there is an E at another position? No, but the word might have at least. However, our goal is to find all the letters that are in the word.

Given that we have few guesses left, we should try to test as many new letters as possible, so avoiding E elsewhere is better.

But is there a word that has E only in position 2 and other positions with available letters and no duplicate?

For example, ""MUD"" not 5.

Let's try: "" D E U G?"" not a word.

""G UE R R"" not.

"" P E G U X"" not common.

Perhaps ""DEFY"" is 4.

We need to consider ""QUERY"" but we have position 2 requirement.

Another idea: What about ""QUEUD"" not a word.

"" DUET"" is 4 letters.

I think we might have to use a word like ""JUDGE"" but J U D G E -> pattern: J U D G E -> position 2=U, not E.

Not matched.

So, perhaps the only practical choice is to use a word with another E.

Consider ""DEEKED"" too long.

So, I will go with ""KEYED"", testing K, Y, D.

But another better option? ""VEXED"" and ""KEYED"" both have two E's.

Or ""DEQUE"" -> D E Q U E -> two E's, and Q and U.

But ""deque"" is a valid word (double-ended queue).

Letters: D, E, Q, U.

All available? D, Q, U are available.

No absent letters.

So, ""deque"" D E Q U E.

Positions: 1=D, 2=E, 3=Q, 4=U, 5=E.

We are testing D, Q, U.

But once again two E's.

But we are testing Q and U, which are less common.

Or ""GUE"" not.

"" M E Q U "" not.

So, between the options:

- ""vexed"" (V E X E D): tests V, X, D
- ""keyed"" (K E Y E D): tests K, Y, D
- ""deque"" (D E Q U E): tests D, Q, U

We should choose based on most common letters? But V, X, K, Y, Q, U are all not very common.

However, U is a vowel and might be more likely.

Perhaps the word is ""EMEND"" but E in position 1? Not.

Or ""E   G U V"" not.

Another can Be ""PEKE"" not 5.

I think we must make a guess. Let's choose ""deque"" because we suspect U might be in the word.

Or we can choose ""vexed"" to include X which is less common, but if it's there, we get information.

But U might be more likely in an English word with E.

We know the word has at least one vowel (E), but if it has another vowel, it must be U (since A, I, O are out).

So, there's a chance that U is in the word.

In a 5-letter word with E at position 2, common structures might include U.

For example, ""TEPID"" but T and I and D? T absent.

"" U E -- "" words are rare.

Words beginning with ""UE"" are very rare in English.

Most words with E at position 2 might have consonants or other vowels.

Another candidate: ""FEZES"" -> F E Z E S -> S absent.

 ""VODU E"" not.

After research, I recall that ""queue"" is a word but 5 letters: Q U E U E -> position 2=U, not E.

So, let's go with ""deque"", which is valid in some contexts, or ""vexed"" is better known.

Perhaps ""perce"" not.

I think ""vexed"" is a reasonable choice.

So, let's guess ""VEXED"".

But we have to output the guess.

So, fourth guess: ""VEXED""

<guess>vexed</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- **Secret word pattern**: The word must have `E` in position 2 (confirmed in Guess 2 and Guess 3), so the structure is `_ E _ _ _`.
- **Absent letters (not in the word)**: A, B, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, W (from Guess 1, Guess 2, and Guess 3).
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.
- **Constraint**: Position 5 cannot be `E` (from Guess 1: `E(-)` in position 5).

For the next guess:
- Must include `E` **only in position 2** (to avoid redundancy and focus on new letters).
- Prioritize new letters not yet tested (D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z) to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters and the forbidden E position.
- Consider potential vowels—since A, I, O are absent, U or Y (as a vowel substitute) may be present.

After evaluating options:
- **""vexed""** (`V E X E D`): Fits the pattern, uses new letters (V, X, D), avoids absences.
  - Tests two common consonants (V, D) and one less common letter (X).
  - Includes `E` in position 4 to probe for a potential second `E` (not confirmed, but possible).
- Alternative words like ""keyed"" (K E Y E D) or ""deque"" (D E Q U E) were considered but deemed less optimal due to repeated `E` or rare letter use.

Guess: **""vexed""**

<guess>vexed</guess>",vexed,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - So, E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""heist"" -> H(x), E(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).

Guess 3: ""below"" -> B(x), E(✓), L(x), O(x), W(x)
  - E is again correct in position 2 (as expected), and B, L, O, W are not in the word.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word is of the form: _ E _ _ _ (since E is fixed at position 2).
- Absent letters (not in the word at all): C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T, B, L, O, W.

Thus, the letters we cannot use are: A, B, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, W.

We have used 11 letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, I, S, T, B, L, O, W (E is present, but the rest are absent).

Available letters: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: we know E is in the word and fixed at position 2, so we only need to fill the other four positions with letters from the available list, but we must also remember that E might be the only vowel? However, we don't know that. The word could have other vowels that we haven't tested? We've tested A, I, O and they are absent. Vowels in English: A, E, I, O, U. We know:
- A, I, O are absent (from feedback).
- E is present.
- U is still unknown (and available).

So, the word must contain at least E (and possibly U or other vowels? But we've tested A, I, O and they are not in the word. So the remaining vowel is U? Or Y? Since Y can sometimes be a vowel.

Therefore, the secret word must have E and either U or Y (or possibly no other vowels if the other letters are consonants? But every word must have a vowel? Not necessarily, but typically. We have E, so that might be enough? But we have to form a valid English word.

Structure: _ E _ _ _

The positions 1, 3, 4, 5 must be filled with letters from: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We also know that E is not in position 5, which is already satisfied.

Given that many common letters are used up, we need to choose a word that uses available letters.

Possible words:
- We need to consider that U might be important.

List of candidate words that are 5 letters, start with E in the second position, and use only available letters.

Examples:
- ""DEBUG"" was a candidate but B is absent? Wait, from guess3, B is absent. So we cannot use B.

We must avoid all absent letters: A, B, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, W.

So, available: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Now, words:
- ""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> but O and N are absent (N from guess1, O from guess3). So invalid.
- ""FEUED"" -> F E U E D -> has two E's? and E is in position 4? We know E is not in position 5, but we don't know about position 4. However, the word must be _ E _ _ _ so positions: 1=F, 2=E, 3=U, 4=E, 5=D. But we already know E is only in position 2? Wait, no, the feedback told us E is in the word and in position 2, but there could be more E's? However, in guess1, E was marked present but wrong position (so if there was another E in position 5, it would have been marked absent? but it was marked with '-' meaning present but wrong position. Since position 5 was wrong, and we now have E fixed at 2, it is possible that there is another E elsewhere? But in guess1, ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. That E could be at another position. But we now know position 2 is E, so the E in guess1 could be the same E? But then why was it marked as '-'? Because it was at the wrong position, and position 2 was not guessed then.

Actually, the E at position 5 in guess1 and the E at position 2 are the same? Not necessarily, the word could have two E's. But we don't have information on that.

In guess2, we got E at position 2 correct, and no other letters were marked present. Similarly in guess3, only E was correct. So it's possible the word has only one E? Or more? We don't know.

So, we should allow for the possibility of another E? But we are trying to get new information, so it might be inefficient to guess a letter we already know is present? But if there is another E, we need to find its position.

However, we know that position 5 cannot be E? Actually, from guess1: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position. So the E at position 5 is not correct, meaning the word does have another E or the same E? Wait, but if the word has E at position 2, then guess1's E at position 5 was correctly identified as present (because E is in the word) but in the wrong position (because it's at position 5 but should be at position 2). So if there's only one E, the '-' in guess1 indicates that E is not in position 5. But if there were two E's, then even if position 5 has E, it would be correct? No, because if the word has E at position 5 and E at position 2, then in guess1 ""crane"" with E at position 5 would get a '-' if position 5 is not the only position for E? Actually, the feedback marks each letter individually. So for the E at position 5 in ""crane"", if the word has E at position 5, it would have been marked with '✓'. But it was marked with '-', meaning that E is in the word but not in position 5. So regardless of whether there is another E or not, position 5 is not E.

Therefore, we know:
- Position 5 ≠ E.
- Position 2 = E.

So, if we want to include another E in our guess, it must be in positions 3 or 4? But we don't know if that E exists.

But to be efficient, we should avoid repeating E? Because testing new letters is more informative.

So, we are looking for a word with E in position 2 and other positions having letters from the available set, without E elsewhere.

So, pattern: [not E or absent] E [not E or absent] [not E or absent] [not E or absent]

And all letters from: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (and we must avoid absent letters).

Let me try to find words that fit.

Common words:
- ""DEPTH"" -> D E P T H -> but T and H are absent (from guess2). Invalid.
- ""DELVE"" -> D E L V E -> L is absent (from guess3) and also has E at the end? But we know position 5 cannot be E, so it would be incorrect, but also L is absent. Invalid.
- ""DEFER"" -> D E F E R -> but R is absent (from guess1) and also repeated E.
- ""DEUCE"" -> D E U C E -> C is absent (from guess1) and has E at end? Invalid.
- ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> I and N absent.
- ""DEMUR"" -> D E M U R -> R absent.
- ""DEVIL"" -> D E V I L -> I and L absent.

We are having a problem because many words use I, O, etc. which are absent.

Let's think of words with only the available letters and no absent ones.

Possible words:
- ""DECKED"" -> too long? 6 letters. We need 5.

What about ""DEUCE"" already invalid.

""JEWEL"" -> J E W E L -> but W and L are absent? W absent from guess3, L from guess3. Invalid.

""MEADOW"" -> M E A D O W -> A and O and W absent? A from guess1, O from guess3, W from guess3. Invalid.

""MEDIA"" -> M E D I A -> I and A absent. Invalid.

It seems we must consider less common words.

What about ""DUMKY"" -> is this a word? Not really.

""UMPED"" -> U M P E D -> E is at position 4? Pattern: U M P E D -> positions: 1=U, 2=E? We need position 2=E, so not.

Pattern must be: position1: any available letter, position2=E, position3: available, position4: available, position5: available.

So, let's look for words with E in the second position and the other letters from: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

And these words must be valid English words.

Examples:
- ""KEVEL"" -> K E V E L -> L absent? L is absent. And also two E's? But L is absent from guess3.

So, invalid.

""PECID"" -> not a word.

""PEWED"" -> P E W E D -> W absent? From guess3, W is absent. Invalid.

""VEXED"" -> V E X E D -> two E's? and E at position 4? So, positions: 1=V, 2=E, 3=X, 4=E, 5=D. This has E at position 4. Also, V, X, D are available? Check: V not absent, X not absent, D not absent. So, this is a valid word? Yes, ""vexed"" meaning annoyed.

But we have E at position 2 and also position 4. We don't know if the word has two E's? But we are testing it.

However, we are using E twice, which means we are only testing three new letters: V, X, D.

Alternatively, we can try to avoid E to get more new letters.

Another candidate: ""DUVET"" -> D U V E T -> but E is at position 4? We need E at position 2: the pattern must be _ E _ _ _. So ""DUVET"" is D U V E T -> positions: 1=D, 2=U, 3=V, 4=E, 5=T -> no E at position 2. So not matching.

We need E at position 2.

Another try: ""VEZIR"" -> not common.

""YUZUS"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""QUEME"" -> Q U E M E -> but E at position 3 and 5? We need E at position 2.

Not.

""JEMBE"" -> J E M B E -> but B is absent. And two E's.

Invalid because B absent.

""MADGE"" -> M A D G E -> A absent.

""PYGMY"" -> P Y G M Y -> no E? Cannot.

I think it's tough. Another option: ""FEMUR"" -> F E M U R -> R is absent. Invalid.

But we found ""vexed"": V E X E D.

But ""vexed"" uses W? No, V E X E D: letters V, E, X, D.

All are available (not in the absent list).

So, we can use ""vexed"".

But we are repeating E, not ideal for information.

Another candidate: ""DEKKO"" -> not standard.

""PERCE?"" Not.

""PEKED"" -> P E K E D -> two E's, and P, K, D are available? P, K, D not absent. So ""peked"" might be a word? Meaning (peke is a dog, but ""peked"" as adjective? not common).

""GEMMY"" -> G E M M Y -> two M's? but pattern: G E M M Y -> E at position 2, but not E elsewhere.

Letters: G, E, M, Y.

All available.

And it's a valid word (like gemmy means full of gems or something).

Similarly, ""MEM"" is not 5 letters.

Another one: ""KEMP"" not 5.

So, ""gemmy"" is G E M M Y -> positions: 1=G, 2=E, 3=M, 4=M, 5=Y.

We are testing G, M, Y? But M is repeated, so we test G, M, Y.

Or ""jemmy"" which is J E M M Y -> but J E M M Y is a word (meaning a crowbar or something).

""jemmy"" has J, E, M, Y.

J is available? Yes.

But we haven't tested J.

However, repeated M? But still, we are testing three new letters.

But we are not testing any potential vowels? We suspect U might be in the word? We don't know.

Another word: ""DEBUG"" but B is absent.

""DEKKO"" not common.

Perhaps ""DEFY"" is 4 letters.

""JUPON"" -> J U P O N -> O and N absent? O from guess3, N from guess1.

Invalid.

I think ""vexed"" V E X E D and ""gemmy"" G E M M Y or ""jemmy"" J E M M Y are options, but they have duplicate letters.

Another one: ""VEZIR"" as ""MEZER"" not common.

""DEIFY"" -> D E I F Y -> but I is absent? From guess2.

Invalid.

""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> O and N absent.

So, alternative: ""VEGAN"" -> V E G A N -> A and N absent.

Invalid.

Perhaps we must consider that the word might have U.

Word: ""MUCID"" -> M U C I D -> C and I absent. No E at position 2.

Not.

We need E at position 2, so let's think of words like:

- U E _ _ _ : like ""UEL-? "" not common.

- P E _ _ _ : ""PEGGY"" -> P E G G Y -> G repeated? Not.

""PUPED"" -> P E? P U P E D -> no.

I think ""vexed"" is a reasonable choice.

Or perhaps ""JEEZE"" -> J E E Z E -> too many E's.

We need to accept that we might have to use a word with repeated letters or with E again.

But let's try to find a word without E in other positions.

For example, ""DEWX?"" not a word.

""GEMEL"" -> G E M E L -> L is absent? And has E at position 4.

But L absent, so invalid.

""FEDER"" -> F E D E R -> R absent.

""DEMIT"" -> D E M I T -> I and T absent.

""KEYED"" -> K E Y E D -> has E at position 2 and 4? And D. But Y and K are available. So ""KEYED"" K E Y E D.

Letters: K, E, Y, D.

Y and D are available? Yes.

K is available? Yes.

But two E's? Yes.

But we are testing K, Y, D.

Positions: 1=K, 2=E, 3=Y, 4=E, 5=D.

However, we know position 5 cannot be E? We have E at position 4, which is not position 5, so that's allowed? But we are guessing E at position 4, which is not position 5. So it's valid.

But will we get separate feedback for each E? Yes.

But we are using two E's, so we might be not testing as many new letters.

Another option: ""HEEDS"" -> but H absent.

""DEEMS"" -> S absent.

""VEKKER"" not 5.

Perhaps ""QUEUE"" -> Q U E U E -> E at position 3? _ E _ _ _ not matched.

We need E at position 2.

So, I think ""KEYED"" is a word? Yes, meaning to have provided with keys or operated by keys.

And it fits: K E Y E D.

Another: ""JEYED"" -> not common.

Or ""PEEBY"" -> P E E B Y -> B is absent.

So, ""KEYED"" is K E Y E D.

Tested letters: K, Y, D (and E twice).

Similarly, ""VEXED"" V E X E D.

Between ""KEYED"" and ""VEXED"", we can choose one.

Or without E duplicate?

Let's search for a word with four new letters and no E elsewhere.

What about ""DUXE D "" D U X E D -> no E at position 2.

How about ""PEG UN"" not a word.

""GUD GE"" not.

""DUMPY"" -> D U M P Y -> no E, not applicable.

We must have E at position 2.

The only words I can think of without using absent letters and without E duplicate are few.

For example:
- ""DEXES"" -> D E X E S -> S absent? S absent from guess2.

In ""DEXES"", S is at the end? S? But S is absent, so invalid.

""FEEZE"" -> F E E Z E -> two E's.

"" JEEPS"" -> J E E P S? S absent.

""MYKT E"" not.

Perhaps ""QUEY?"" Q U E Y -> 4 letters.

I think it's hard to find, so maybe we should go with a word that has E only at position 2 and the letter U in one of the position.

For example, ""DEBUS"" -> D E B U S -> B and S absent. Invalid.

""DEPUD"" not a word.

""EMEU"" not 5.

We might have to use ""vexed"".

Another common word: ""bevel"" but B and L absent.

So, let's go with ""VEXED"" or ""KEYED"".

Or ""GEMUL"" not a word.

Let's choose ""KEYED"": K E Y E D.

But we are repeating E, which might not give us new information. However, we might discover if there is an E at position 4.

But we know from guess1 that E is not at position 5, but position 4 is possible.

Similarly, position 3 is possible.

So, we can gain position information for E.

But we already know E is at position 2, and if we get a '-' for position 4 E, then we know there is an E at another position? No, but the word might have at least. However, our goal is to find all the letters that are in the word.

Given that we have few guesses left, we should try to test as many new letters as possible, so avoiding E elsewhere is better.

But is there a word that has E only in position 2 and other positions with available letters and no duplicate?

For example, ""MUD"" not 5.

Let's try: "" D E U G?"" not a word.

""G UE R R"" not.

"" P E G U X"" not common.

Perhaps ""DEFY"" is 4.

We need to consider ""QUERY"" but we have position 2 requirement.

Another idea: What about ""QUEUD"" not a word.

"" DUET"" is 4 letters.

I think we might have to use a word like ""JUDGE"" but J U D G E -> pattern: J U D G E -> position 2=U, not E.

Not matched.

So, perhaps the only practical choice is to use a word with another E.

Consider ""DEEKED"" too long.

So, I will go with ""KEYED"", testing K, Y, D.

But another better option? ""VEXED"" and ""KEYED"" both have two E's.

Or ""DEQUE"" -> D E Q U E -> two E's, and Q and U.

But ""deque"" is a valid word (double-ended queue).

Letters: D, E, Q, U.

All available? D, Q, U are available.

No absent letters.

So, ""deque"" D E Q U E.

Positions: 1=D, 2=E, 3=Q, 4=U, 5=E.

We are testing D, Q, U.

But once again two E's.

But we are testing Q and U, which are less common.

Or ""GUE"" not.

"" M E Q U "" not.

So, between the options:

- ""vexed"" (V E X E D): tests V, X, D
- ""keyed"" (K E Y E D): tests K, Y, D
- ""deque"" (D E Q U E): tests D, Q, U

We should choose based on most common letters? But V, X, K, Y, Q, U are all not very common.

However, U is a vowel and might be more likely.

Perhaps the word is ""EMEND"" but E in position 1? Not.

Or ""E   G U V"" not.

Another can Be ""PEKE"" not 5.

I think we must make a guess. Let's choose ""deque"" because we suspect U might be in the word.

Or we can choose ""vexed"" to include X which is less common, but if it's there, we get information.

But U might be more likely in an English word with E.

We know the word has at least one vowel (E), but if it has another vowel, it must be U (since A, I, O are out).

So, there's a chance that U is in the word.

In a 5-letter word with E at position 2, common structures might include U.

For example, ""TEPID"" but T and I and D? T absent.

"" U E -- "" words are rare.

Words beginning with ""UE"" are very rare in English.

Most words with E at position 2 might have consonants or other vowels.

Another candidate: ""FEZES"" -> F E Z E S -> S absent.

 ""VODU E"" not.

After research, I recall that ""queue"" is a word but 5 letters: Q U E U E -> position 2=U, not E.

So, let's go with ""deque"", which is valid in some contexts, or ""vexed"" is better known.

Perhaps ""perce"" not.

I think ""vexed"" is a reasonable choice.

So, let's guess ""VEXED"".

But we have to output the guess.

So, fourth guess: ""VEXED""

<guess>vexed</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- **Secret word pattern**: The word must have `E` in position 2 (confirmed in Guess 2 and Guess 3), so the structure is `_ E _ _ _`.
- **Absent letters (not in the word)**: A, B, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, W (from Guess 1, Guess 2, and Guess 3).
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.
- **Constraint**: Position 5 cannot be `E` (from Guess 1: `E(-)` in position 5).

For the next guess:
- Must include `E` **only in position 2** (to avoid redundancy and focus on new letters).
- Prioritize new letters not yet tested (D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z) to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters and the forbidden E position.
- Consider potential vowels—since A, I, O are absent, U or Y (as a vowel substitute) may be present.

After evaluating options:
- **""vexed""** (`V E X E D`): Fits the pattern, uses new letters (V, X, D), avoids absences.
  - Tests two common consonants (V, D) and one less common letter (X).
  - Includes `E` in position 4 to probe for a potential second `E` (not confirmed, but possible).
- Alternative words like ""keyed"" (K E Y E D) or ""deque"" (D E Q U E) were considered but deemed less optimal due to repeated `E` or rare letter use.

Guess: **""vexed""**",Guess 4: vexed -> FEEDBACK: V(x) E(✓) X(x) E(-) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,geeky,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since in ""crane"", E was at the end).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Since we have only one letter that is present (E) and it's not in the 5th position, we need to make a second guess.

 We must choose a 5-letter word that:
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N (because they are not in the word).
 - Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the end and that was wrong).

 Also, we want to maximize information by including other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's think of common letters we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We know E is in the word, so we should try to put E in a different position (positions 1,2,3, or 4) and also include other common consonants.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, M, D, etc.

 We also note that the word must have an E, and we have 4 new positions to test.

 A good strategy is to try a word that has E in a different position and uses other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that has E in the first position? But note: we don't know if E can be at the beginning. However, we know it's not at the end.

 Alternatively, we can avoid the 5th position for E.

 Let me think of words that have E and do not contain C, R, A, N.

 Example: ""times"" -> but we don't know if T, I, M, S are in the word. However, we can use this.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me list some words that have E and are made of the remaining letters.

 Possibilities: 
   E in position 1: e.g., ""e"" _ _ _ _
   E in position 2: _ ""e"" _ _ _
   E in position 3: _ _ ""e"" _ _
   E in position 4: _ _ _ ""e"" _

 We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tested (so not position 5). We tested E at position 5, so we can try E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 I think a good candidate is ""SPELT"" (meaning: a type of wheat) or ""SLEPT"", but note we don't know if S, P, E, L, T are in the word.

 However, we know E is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end again, which we know is not the position for E (because in ""crane"" E was at the end and got '-', meaning it's present but not at the end). So we must avoid putting E at the end.

 So, let's avoid the 5th position for E.

 I think ""STEEL"" is not good because it has two E's and we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we want to test more letters.

 Alternatively, ""BELIE"" -> but that has E at the end? No, ""belie"" ends with E? Actually, ""belie"" is 5 letters: B-E-L-I-E -> so the last letter is E, which we want to avoid.

 How about ""MEDIA""? But we have A which we know is not in the word (from the first feedback: A is absent). So we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, C, R, N.

 So, let's try to form a word without A, C, R, N and with E not in the 5th position.

 Example: ""BELOW"" -> B, E, L, O, W. E is in the second position. This seems good.

 But note: we don't know if B, L, O, W are in the word. We are testing them.

 Another example: ""FIGHT"" -> no E, so that doesn't work.

 We must include E.

 Another: ""SPEED"" -> E at position 3 and 4? And ends with D. But we don't know if we can have two E's? We don't have information about duplicate letters. However, we know the word has at least one E.

 But to maximize information, we should use distinct letters if possible. However, ""SPEED"" has two E's and two of the same letter might not be as informative.

 How about ""SPIEL""? That's a word: S, P, I, E, L. E is in the 4th position. This avoids the 5th position and doesn't use A, C, R, N.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters.

 Alternatively, ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end, which we must avoid.

 How about ""STYLE""? S, T, Y, L, E -> again E at the end.

 We need E not at the end.

 Let me think of words with E in the middle.

 Words: 
   Position 1: EDITS, ECLAT (but ECLAT has C and A, which are absent) -> not allowed.
   Position 2: HELLO -> H, E, L, L, O -> but two L's? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, we haven't tested H, L, O.

   But we can use: ""HEIST"" -> H, E, I, S, T. E is in position 2. This seems good.

   ""HEIST"" does not contain A, C, R, N. It has H, E, I, S, T.

   Another: ""DEBIT"" -> D, E, B, I, T. E in position 2.

   ""DEBIT"" is also a valid word.

   Which one is better? Both are good. We can choose one.

   Alternatively, ""PESTO"" -> P, E, S, T, O. E in position 2.

   But note: we want to test as many common letters as possible. The letters in ""HEIST"" are H, E, I, S, T. The letters in ""DEBIT"" are D, E, B, I, T. The letters in ""PESTO"" are P, E, S, T, O.

   Since we already know E is in the word, we are testing 4 new letters in each.

   Common letters: S, T, H, I, D, B, P, O.

   I think ""HEIST"" is a good choice because it has S and T which are very common.

   But note: we are not sure if the word has H, I, S, T.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tested. We only tested E at position 5. So we can test E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   I think ""HEIST"" is a solid choice.

   However, let me check if there's a word that uses more vowels? We know the word has at least one E, but we don't know about other vowels. We haven't tested O, U, I.

   ""HEIST"" has E and I.

   Another option: ""MOUSE"" -> but E is at the end, which we avoid.

   ""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E is at position 4. This is acceptable. And it tests T, O, W, E, L.

   But we don't know if O, W, L are in the word.

   I think ""TOWEL"" is also a good candidate.

   However, we must avoid the absent letters: A, C, R, N. ""TOWEL"" does not contain these.

   But note: we are trying to find the position of E. In ""TOWEL"", E is at position 4. In ""HEIST"", E is at position 2.

   We don't have any information about the position of E, so either is fine.

   I think I'll go with ""HEIST"" because it has common letters and we can get more information.

   So, second guess: ""HEIST""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   But note: we must not use the absent letters. We are safe with H, E, I, S, T.

   Therefore, I choose ""HEIST"".

<guess>heist</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's in the word), but **not in position 5**.
- Must **avoid** C, R, A, and N entirely.
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, H) to maximize information.

The word **""heist""** fits these criteria:
- Contains **E** in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: H, I, S, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and the incorrect E position (5th).

<guess>heist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: heist -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, N are not in the word.
  - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""heist"" -> H(x) E(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
Meaning:
  - H, I, S, T are not in the word.
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).

From the second guess, we know that E is in position 2 (because we got a check for E at the second position).

So, the secret word has the form: _ E _ _ _

We also know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, I, S, T.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has E in the second position (since we know it's correct and fixed there).
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.
- Uses new letters to get more information.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 we've used (C,R,A,N,E,H,I,S,T) and E is fixed so we don't need to test it again, but we are including it in position 2. Actually, we have to avoid the absent letters, but E is present and fixed.

So, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.

We can use any letter except these. Also, we know E is in position 2, so we must have E in the second position.

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form: _ E _ _ _

We should try to use common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information, so we should try to use as many new common letters as possible.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ E _ _ _ and use only the available letters.

Some examples:
- ""DEUCE"" -> but E is at position 2? D E U C E -> but C is absent (from first guess) and also has E at the end which we don't know about, but we are avoiding C. So invalid because of C.
- ""BELOW"" -> B E L O W -> but we have E in position 2. And letters: B, E, L, O, W. Check absent: B is not in the absent list, L is not, O is not, W is not. So this is a candidate.
- ""BELIE"" -> B E L I E -> but I is absent (from second guess) and also has E at the end. So invalid because of I.
- ""BEVEL"" -> B E V E L -> has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. However, we are avoiding absent letters: V and L are not in the absent list. But note: we have E at the end? The pattern is _ E _ _ _, so BEVEL: position1=B, position2=E, position3=V, position4=E, position5=L. So it has E at position 2 and 4. We don't know if the word has two E's, but it's allowed. However, we are testing new letters: B, V, L. But we are repeating E, which we already know is in the word. It might be better to test all new letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible. So words without E in other positions might be better? But we don't know if there is another E.

Alternatively, we can avoid using E again to test other letters. But we have to put E in position 2.

So, the word must have E in position 2, and the other four positions should be new letters that are not absent and not E? But if the word has another E, that's okay, but we might not get information about that position.

But to maximize new information, we should try to use a word that has four new distinct letters (if possible) and no duplicates.

So, let's try to find a word of the form [letter1] E [letter2] [letter3] [letter4] where letter1, letter2, letter3, letter4 are from the available letters and distinct.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: B, D, L, M, O, P, U, Y.

Words:
- ""BEDIM"" -> B E D I M -> but I is absent (from guess2). Invalid.
- ""BEFOG"" -> B E F O G -> letters: B, F, O, G. All are available. This is a word? Yes, meaning to confuse. So: B E F O G.
- ""BEGET"" -> B E G E T -> but T is absent (from guess2). Invalid.
- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> I and N are absent. Invalid.
- ""BEVEL"" -> as above, has two E's and we are testing V and L, but we have E again. Not ideal because we are using E again which we already know.
- ""BEVY"" -> too short? 5 letters? No, BEVY is 4 letters.
- ""DEUCE"" -> invalid because of C and U? C is absent, but U is available? But C is absent so invalid.
- ""DELVE"" -> D E L V E -> again two E's. And we are testing D, L, V. But we have E at the end. We don't know if E is at the end? Actually, we know E is not at the end because in the first guess ""crane"" had E at the end and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word does not have E at the end. Therefore, we cannot have a word with E in the 5th position. So ""DELVE"" has E at the end -> invalid because we know E is not in position 5.

So we must avoid position 5 for E? Yes, because we know from the first guess that E is not in position 5. So any word that has E in position 5 is invalid for guessing because it violates the known fact.

Therefore, we must choose a word that has E in position 2 and does not have E in any other position? Not necessarily, but if we put E in position 5, we know it's wrong, so it would be a waste. But we are forced by the word choice? Actually, we can avoid words that have E in position 5.

So, back to ""BEFOG"": B E F O G -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:F, 4:O, 5:G. No E in position 5. And no absent letters. This is a valid word.

Another: ""BEMUD"" -> not a common word.

""BEPAT"" -> not a word.

""BOWEL"" -> B O W E L -> but E is in position 4? We need E in position 2. So this doesn't fit the pattern.

We need E in position 2.

Another: ""DEBAR"" -> D E B A R -> but A and R are absent. Invalid.

""DEBUG"" -> D E B U G -> letters: D, E, B, U, G. All available? D, B, U, G are not in the absent list. And no E in position 5. So ""DEBUG"" is a word (meaning to remove bugs). So: D E B U G.

But note: we are using D, B, U, G. That's four new letters.

Similarly, ""BEFOG"" uses F, O, G.

Which one is better? Both are valid.

We can also consider ""DEMOB"" -> D E M O B -> same letters as above? D, E, M, O, B. M and O are available.

But we have B and D in both? Actually, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have two candidates: ""DEBUG"" and ""BEFOG"".

""DEBUG"": tests D, B, U, G.
""BEFOG"": tests B, F, O, G.

Common letters: B and G are in both? But we are testing different sets.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should prioritize the most common letters. Common letters in English: among the available ones, B, D, F, G, L, M, O, P, U, Y.

So, ""DEBUG"" has B, D, U, G -> common letters: B, D, G, U (U is less common).
""BEFOG"" has B, F, O, G -> common letters: B, F, O, G.

F and O are quite common.

Another candidate: ""BEMIX"" -> not a word? Or ""BEMUD"" not common.

""BEGUM"" -> B E G U M -> letters: B, G, U, M. This is a word (a Muslim woman). So: B E G U M.

This tests B, G, U, M.

But we have multiple options.

We can also consider ""PEDAL"" -> P E D A L -> but A is absent. Invalid.

""LEVEL"" -> L E V E L -> has two E's and two L's? And E at the end? But we know E is not at the end. Also, we are repeating letters. Not ideal.

""JEWEL"" -> J E W E L -> again two E's and E at the end? We know E is not at the end. So invalid.

""MELEE"" -> M E L E E -> multiple E's and ends with E -> invalid.

So, let's stick with words without E in other positions and without absent letters.

Another word: ""FECAL"" -> F E C A L -> C and A are absent. Invalid.

""BEFIT"" -> B E F I T -> I and T are absent (from guess2). Invalid.

So, we have a few candidates: ""DEBUG"", ""BEFOG"", ""BEGUM"", and maybe ""DEBUT"" -> D E B U T -> but T is absent. Invalid.

""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> N is absent. Invalid.

""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> N absent.

So, ""DEBUG"" and ""BEFOG"" and ""BEGUM"" are among the few.

Another: ""BEHOW"" -> not a word.

""BEVUE"" -> not common and has E at the end.

""BEDEW"" -> B E D E W -> two E's and we don't know if there's a second E. Also, we are testing B, D, W. But we have E again. And we know E is not at the end? Position 5 is W, so that's okay. But we have E at position 4? We don't know if that's allowed. But we are trying to avoid using E again to get more new letters.

So, I think ""BEFOG"" is a good choice because it has four new letters: B, F, O, G.

Similarly, ""DEBUG"" has B, D, U, G.

But note: we are testing B in both. We don't know if B is in the word. We are testing it.

I think I'll go with ""BEFOG"" because it has O and F which are common.

But let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters.

Another word: ""BELOW"" -> B E L O W -> we considered earlier. It has E in position 2, and letters B, L, O, W. All available. And no E elsewhere. This is a good candidate.

""BELOW"" is a common word and tests B, L, O, W.

Similarly, ""MELLOW"" is 6 letters.

So, now we have:
- ""BEFOG"": B, F, O, G
- ""DEBUG"": B, D, U, G
- ""BEGUM"": B, G, U, M
- ""BELOW"": B, L, O, W

Which one to choose? We should choose the one that has the most common letters.

Common letters in English words: among the available, the frequencies: E is already known, then T is out, so next are: O, L, D, M, F, etc.

But we don't have T, so O and L are very common.

Therefore, ""BELOW"" has L and O, which are very common, and also B and W.

So, ""BELOW"" might be a better choice.

We can also consider ""MELON"" -> M E L O N -> but N is absent. Invalid.

""HELLO"" -> H is absent.

So, ""BELOW"" seems good.

But note: we must avoid the absent letters. ""BELOW"" has B, E, L, O, W. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,N,H,I,S,T). So it's valid.

Therefore, I choose ""BELOW"".

So, third guess: ""BELOW""

<guess>below</guess>After analyzing the feedback:
- **E is confirmed in position 2** (from Guess 2: ""heist"" → E(✓)).
- The secret word has the structure: `_ E _ _ _`.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T (cannot be used).
- **E cannot be in position 5** (from Guess 1: ""crane"" → E(-)).

For the next guess:
- Must include **E in position 2**.
- Must avoid all absent letters (C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T).
- Should prioritize testing new, common letters (e.g., B, L, O, W, D, F, G, M, P, U, Y) to maximize information.

The word **""below""** fits perfectly:
- **E is in position 2** (required).
- Uses new, common letters: **B, L, O, W** (all untested and not absent).
- Avoids E in position 5 and all forbidden letters.
- Tests for potential vowels (O) and consonants (B, L, W) in unknown positions.

<guess>below</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: heist -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
Guess 3: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - So, E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""heist"" -> H(x), E(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).

Guess 3: ""below"" -> B(x), E(✓), L(x), O(x), W(x)
  - E is again correct in position 2 (as expected), and B, L, O, W are not in the word.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word is of the form: _ E _ _ _ (since E is fixed at position 2).
- Absent letters (not in the word at all): C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T, B, L, O, W.

Thus, the letters we cannot use are: A, B, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, W.

We have used 11 letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, I, S, T, B, L, O, W (E is present, but the rest are absent).

Available letters: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: we know E is in the word and fixed at position 2, so we only need to fill the other four positions with letters from the available list, but we must also remember that E might be the only vowel? However, we don't know that. The word could have other vowels that we haven't tested? We've tested A, I, O and they are absent. Vowels in English: A, E, I, O, U. We know:
- A, I, O are absent (from feedback).
- E is present.
- U is still unknown (and available).

So, the word must contain at least E (and possibly U or other vowels? But we've tested A, I, O and they are not in the word. So the remaining vowel is U? Or Y? Since Y can sometimes be a vowel.

Therefore, the secret word must have E and either U or Y (or possibly no other vowels if the other letters are consonants? But every word must have a vowel? Not necessarily, but typically. We have E, so that might be enough? But we have to form a valid English word.

Structure: _ E _ _ _

The positions 1, 3, 4, 5 must be filled with letters from: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We also know that E is not in position 5, which is already satisfied.

Given that many common letters are used up, we need to choose a word that uses available letters.

Possible words:
- We need to consider that U might be important.

List of candidate words that are 5 letters, start with E in the second position, and use only available letters.

Examples:
- ""DEBUG"" was a candidate but B is absent? Wait, from guess3, B is absent. So we cannot use B.

We must avoid all absent letters: A, B, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, W.

So, available: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Now, words:
- ""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> but O and N are absent (N from guess1, O from guess3). So invalid.
- ""FEUED"" -> F E U E D -> has two E's? and E is in position 4? We know E is not in position 5, but we don't know about position 4. However, the word must be _ E _ _ _ so positions: 1=F, 2=E, 3=U, 4=E, 5=D. But we already know E is only in position 2? Wait, no, the feedback told us E is in the word and in position 2, but there could be more E's? However, in guess1, E was marked present but wrong position (so if there was another E in position 5, it would have been marked absent? but it was marked with '-' meaning present but wrong position. Since position 5 was wrong, and we now have E fixed at 2, it is possible that there is another E elsewhere? But in guess1, ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. That E could be at another position. But we now know position 2 is E, so the E in guess1 could be the same E? But then why was it marked as '-'? Because it was at the wrong position, and position 2 was not guessed then.

Actually, the E at position 5 in guess1 and the E at position 2 are the same? Not necessarily, the word could have two E's. But we don't have information on that.

In guess2, we got E at position 2 correct, and no other letters were marked present. Similarly in guess3, only E was correct. So it's possible the word has only one E? Or more? We don't know.

So, we should allow for the possibility of another E? But we are trying to get new information, so it might be inefficient to guess a letter we already know is present? But if there is another E, we need to find its position.

However, we know that position 5 cannot be E? Actually, from guess1: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position. So the E at position 5 is not correct, meaning the word does have another E or the same E? Wait, but if the word has E at position 2, then guess1's E at position 5 was correctly identified as present (because E is in the word) but in the wrong position (because it's at position 5 but should be at position 2). So if there's only one E, the '-' in guess1 indicates that E is not in position 5. But if there were two E's, then even if position 5 has E, it would be correct? No, because if the word has E at position 5 and E at position 2, then in guess1 ""crane"" with E at position 5 would get a '-' if position 5 is not the only position for E? Actually, the feedback marks each letter individually. So for the E at position 5 in ""crane"", if the word has E at position 5, it would have been marked with '✓'. But it was marked with '-', meaning that E is in the word but not in position 5. So regardless of whether there is another E or not, position 5 is not E.

Therefore, we know:
- Position 5 ≠ E.
- Position 2 = E.

So, if we want to include another E in our guess, it must be in positions 3 or 4? But we don't know if that E exists.

But to be efficient, we should avoid repeating E? Because testing new letters is more informative.

So, we are looking for a word with E in position 2 and other positions having letters from the available set, without E elsewhere.

So, pattern: [not E or absent] E [not E or absent] [not E or absent] [not E or absent]

And all letters from: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (and we must avoid absent letters).

Let me try to find words that fit.

Common words:
- ""DEPTH"" -> D E P T H -> but T and H are absent (from guess2). Invalid.
- ""DELVE"" -> D E L V E -> L is absent (from guess3) and also has E at the end? But we know position 5 cannot be E, so it would be incorrect, but also L is absent. Invalid.
- ""DEFER"" -> D E F E R -> but R is absent (from guess1) and also repeated E.
- ""DEUCE"" -> D E U C E -> C is absent (from guess1) and has E at end? Invalid.
- ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> I and N absent.
- ""DEMUR"" -> D E M U R -> R absent.
- ""DEVIL"" -> D E V I L -> I and L absent.

We are having a problem because many words use I, O, etc. which are absent.

Let's think of words with only the available letters and no absent ones.

Possible words:
- ""DECKED"" -> too long? 6 letters. We need 5.

What about ""DEUCE"" already invalid.

""JEWEL"" -> J E W E L -> but W and L are absent? W absent from guess3, L from guess3. Invalid.

""MEADOW"" -> M E A D O W -> A and O and W absent? A from guess1, O from guess3, W from guess3. Invalid.

""MEDIA"" -> M E D I A -> I and A absent. Invalid.

It seems we must consider less common words.

What about ""DUMKY"" -> is this a word? Not really.

""UMPED"" -> U M P E D -> E is at position 4? Pattern: U M P E D -> positions: 1=U, 2=E? We need position 2=E, so not.

Pattern must be: position1: any available letter, position2=E, position3: available, position4: available, position5: available.

So, let's look for words with E in the second position and the other letters from: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

And these words must be valid English words.

Examples:
- ""KEVEL"" -> K E V E L -> L absent? L is absent. And also two E's? But L is absent from guess3.

So, invalid.

""PECID"" -> not a word.

""PEWED"" -> P E W E D -> W absent? From guess3, W is absent. Invalid.

""VEXED"" -> V E X E D -> two E's? and E at position 4? So, positions: 1=V, 2=E, 3=X, 4=E, 5=D. This has E at position 4. Also, V, X, D are available? Check: V not absent, X not absent, D not absent. So, this is a valid word? Yes, ""vexed"" meaning annoyed.

But we have E at position 2 and also position 4. We don't know if the word has two E's? But we are testing it.

However, we are using E twice, which means we are only testing three new letters: V, X, D.

Alternatively, we can try to avoid E to get more new letters.

Another candidate: ""DUVET"" -> D U V E T -> but E is at position 4? We need E at position 2: the pattern must be _ E _ _ _. So ""DUVET"" is D U V E T -> positions: 1=D, 2=U, 3=V, 4=E, 5=T -> no E at position 2. So not matching.

We need E at position 2.

Another try: ""VEZIR"" -> not common.

""YUZUS"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""QUEME"" -> Q U E M E -> but E at position 3 and 5? We need E at position 2.

Not.

""JEMBE"" -> J E M B E -> but B is absent. And two E's.

Invalid because B absent.

""MADGE"" -> M A D G E -> A absent.

""PYGMY"" -> P Y G M Y -> no E? Cannot.

I think it's tough. Another option: ""FEMUR"" -> F E M U R -> R is absent. Invalid.

But we found ""vexed"": V E X E D.

But ""vexed"" uses W? No, V E X E D: letters V, E, X, D.

All are available (not in the absent list).

So, we can use ""vexed"".

But we are repeating E, not ideal for information.

Another candidate: ""DEKKO"" -> not standard.

""PERCE?"" Not.

""PEKED"" -> P E K E D -> two E's, and P, K, D are available? P, K, D not absent. So ""peked"" might be a word? Meaning (peke is a dog, but ""peked"" as adjective? not common).

""GEMMY"" -> G E M M Y -> two M's? but pattern: G E M M Y -> E at position 2, but not E elsewhere.

Letters: G, E, M, Y.

All available.

And it's a valid word (like gemmy means full of gems or something).

Similarly, ""MEM"" is not 5 letters.

Another one: ""KEMP"" not 5.

So, ""gemmy"" is G E M M Y -> positions: 1=G, 2=E, 3=M, 4=M, 5=Y.

We are testing G, M, Y? But M is repeated, so we test G, M, Y.

Or ""jemmy"" which is J E M M Y -> but J E M M Y is a word (meaning a crowbar or something).

""jemmy"" has J, E, M, Y.

J is available? Yes.

But we haven't tested J.

However, repeated M? But still, we are testing three new letters.

But we are not testing any potential vowels? We suspect U might be in the word? We don't know.

Another word: ""DEBUG"" but B is absent.

""DEKKO"" not common.

Perhaps ""DEFY"" is 4 letters.

""JUPON"" -> J U P O N -> O and N absent? O from guess3, N from guess1.

Invalid.

I think ""vexed"" V E X E D and ""gemmy"" G E M M Y or ""jemmy"" J E M M Y are options, but they have duplicate letters.

Another one: ""VEZIR"" as ""MEZER"" not common.

""DEIFY"" -> D E I F Y -> but I is absent? From guess2.

Invalid.

""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> O and N absent.

So, alternative: ""VEGAN"" -> V E G A N -> A and N absent.

Invalid.

Perhaps we must consider that the word might have U.

Word: ""MUCID"" -> M U C I D -> C and I absent. No E at position 2.

Not.

We need E at position 2, so let's think of words like:

- U E _ _ _ : like ""UEL-? "" not common.

- P E _ _ _ : ""PEGGY"" -> P E G G Y -> G repeated? Not.

""PUPED"" -> P E? P U P E D -> no.

I think ""vexed"" is a reasonable choice.

Or perhaps ""JEEZE"" -> J E E Z E -> too many E's.

We need to accept that we might have to use a word with repeated letters or with E again.

But let's try to find a word without E in other positions.

For example, ""DEWX?"" not a word.

""GEMEL"" -> G E M E L -> L is absent? And has E at position 4.

But L absent, so invalid.

""FEDER"" -> F E D E R -> R absent.

""DEMIT"" -> D E M I T -> I and T absent.

""KEYED"" -> K E Y E D -> has E at position 2 and 4? And D. But Y and K are available. So ""KEYED"" K E Y E D.

Letters: K, E, Y, D.

Y and D are available? Yes.

K is available? Yes.

But two E's? Yes.

But we are testing K, Y, D.

Positions: 1=K, 2=E, 3=Y, 4=E, 5=D.

However, we know position 5 cannot be E? We have E at position 4, which is not position 5, so that's allowed? But we are guessing E at position 4, which is not position 5. So it's valid.

But will we get separate feedback for each E? Yes.

But we are using two E's, so we might be not testing as many new letters.

Another option: ""HEEDS"" -> but H absent.

""DEEMS"" -> S absent.

""VEKKER"" not 5.

Perhaps ""QUEUE"" -> Q U E U E -> E at position 3? _ E _ _ _ not matched.

We need E at position 2.

So, I think ""KEYED"" is a word? Yes, meaning to have provided with keys or operated by keys.

And it fits: K E Y E D.

Another: ""JEYED"" -> not common.

Or ""PEEBY"" -> P E E B Y -> B is absent.

So, ""KEYED"" is K E Y E D.

Tested letters: K, Y, D (and E twice).

Similarly, ""VEXED"" V E X E D.

Between ""KEYED"" and ""VEXED"", we can choose one.

Or without E duplicate?

Let's search for a word with four new letters and no E elsewhere.

What about ""DUXE D "" D U X E D -> no E at position 2.

How about ""PEG UN"" not a word.

""GUD GE"" not.

""DUMPY"" -> D U M P Y -> no E, not applicable.

We must have E at position 2.

The only words I can think of without using absent letters and without E duplicate are few.

For example:
- ""DEXES"" -> D E X E S -> S absent? S absent from guess2.

In ""DEXES"", S is at the end? S? But S is absent, so invalid.

""FEEZE"" -> F E E Z E -> two E's.

"" JEEPS"" -> J E E P S? S absent.

""MYKT E"" not.

Perhaps ""QUEY?"" Q U E Y -> 4 letters.

I think it's hard to find, so maybe we should go with a word that has E only at position 2 and the letter U in one of the position.

For example, ""DEBUS"" -> D E B U S -> B and S absent. Invalid.

""DEPUD"" not a word.

""EMEU"" not 5.

We might have to use ""vexed"".

Another common word: ""bevel"" but B and L absent.

So, let's go with ""VEXED"" or ""KEYED"".

Or ""GEMUL"" not a word.

Let's choose ""KEYED"": K E Y E D.

But we are repeating E, which might not give us new information. However, we might discover if there is an E at position 4.

But we know from guess1 that E is not at position 5, but position 4 is possible.

Similarly, position 3 is possible.

So, we can gain position information for E.

But we already know E is at position 2, and if we get a '-' for position 4 E, then we know there is an E at another position? No, but the word might have at least. However, our goal is to find all the letters that are in the word.

Given that we have few guesses left, we should try to test as many new letters as possible, so avoiding E elsewhere is better.

But is there a word that has E only in position 2 and other positions with available letters and no duplicate?

For example, ""MUD"" not 5.

Let's try: "" D E U G?"" not a word.

""G UE R R"" not.

"" P E G U X"" not common.

Perhaps ""DEFY"" is 4.

We need to consider ""QUERY"" but we have position 2 requirement.

Another idea: What about ""QUEUD"" not a word.

"" DUET"" is 4 letters.

I think we might have to use a word like ""JUDGE"" but J U D G E -> pattern: J U D G E -> position 2=U, not E.

Not matched.

So, perhaps the only practical choice is to use a word with another E.

Consider ""DEEKED"" too long.

So, I will go with ""KEYED"", testing K, Y, D.

But another better option? ""VEXED"" and ""KEYED"" both have two E's.

Or ""DEQUE"" -> D E Q U E -> two E's, and Q and U.

But ""deque"" is a valid word (double-ended queue).

Letters: D, E, Q, U.

All available? D, Q, U are available.

No absent letters.

So, ""deque"" D E Q U E.

Positions: 1=D, 2=E, 3=Q, 4=U, 5=E.

We are testing D, Q, U.

But once again two E's.

But we are testing Q and U, which are less common.

Or ""GUE"" not.

"" M E Q U "" not.

So, between the options:

- ""vexed"" (V E X E D): tests V, X, D
- ""keyed"" (K E Y E D): tests K, Y, D
- ""deque"" (D E Q U E): tests D, Q, U

We should choose based on most common letters? But V, X, K, Y, Q, U are all not very common.

However, U is a vowel and might be more likely.

Perhaps the word is ""EMEND"" but E in position 1? Not.

Or ""E   G U V"" not.

Another can Be ""PEKE"" not 5.

I think we must make a guess. Let's choose ""deque"" because we suspect U might be in the word.

Or we can choose ""vexed"" to include X which is less common, but if it's there, we get information.

But U might be more likely in an English word with E.

We know the word has at least one vowel (E), but if it has another vowel, it must be U (since A, I, O are out).

So, there's a chance that U is in the word.

In a 5-letter word with E at position 2, common structures might include U.

For example, ""TEPID"" but T and I and D? T absent.

"" U E -- "" words are rare.

Words beginning with ""UE"" are very rare in English.

Most words with E at position 2 might have consonants or other vowels.

Another candidate: ""FEZES"" -> F E Z E S -> S absent.

 ""VODU E"" not.

After research, I recall that ""queue"" is a word but 5 letters: Q U E U E -> position 2=U, not E.

So, let's go with ""deque"", which is valid in some contexts, or ""vexed"" is better known.

Perhaps ""perce"" not.

I think ""vexed"" is a reasonable choice.

So, let's guess ""VEXED"".

But we have to output the guess.

So, fourth guess: ""VEXED""

<guess>vexed</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- **Secret word pattern**: The word must have `E` in position 2 (confirmed in Guess 2 and Guess 3), so the structure is `_ E _ _ _`.
- **Absent letters (not in the word)**: A, B, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, W (from Guess 1, Guess 2, and Guess 3).
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.
- **Constraint**: Position 5 cannot be `E` (from Guess 1: `E(-)` in position 5).

For the next guess:
- Must include `E` **only in position 2** (to avoid redundancy and focus on new letters).
- Prioritize new letters not yet tested (D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z) to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters and the forbidden E position.
- Consider potential vowels—since A, I, O are absent, U or Y (as a vowel substitute) may be present.

After evaluating options:
- **""vexed""** (`V E X E D`): Fits the pattern, uses new letters (V, X, D), avoids absences.
  - Tests two common consonants (V, D) and one less common letter (X).
  - Includes `E` in position 4 to probe for a potential second `E` (not confirmed, but possible).
- Alternative words like ""keyed"" (K E Y E D) or ""deque"" (D E Q U E) were considered but deemed less optimal due to repeated `E` or rare letter use.

We tested E at position 5, so we can try E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n I think a good candidate is ""SPELT"" (meaning: a type of wheat) or ""SLEPT"", but note we don\'t know if S, P, E, L, T are in the word.\n\n However, we know E is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position.\n\n Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end again, which we know is not the position for E (because in ""crane"" E was at the end and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not at the end). So we must avoid putting E at the end.\n\n So, let\'s avoid the 5th position for E.\n\n I think ""STEEL"" is not good because it has two E\'s and we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we want to test more letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""BELIE"" -> but that has E at the end? No, ""belie"" ends with E? Actually, ""belie"" is 5 letters: B-E-L-I-E -> so the last letter is E, which we want to avoid.\n\n How about ""MEDIA""? But we have A which we know is not in the word (from the first feedback: A is absent). So we cannot use A.\n\n We must avoid A, C, R, N.\n\n So, let\'s try to form a word without A, C, R, N and with E not in the 5th position.\n\n Example: ""BELOW"" -> B, E, L, O, W. E is in the second position. This seems good.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if B, L, O, W are in the word. We are testing them.\n\n Another example: ""FIGHT"" -> no E, so that doesn\'t work.\n\n We must include E.\n\n Another: ""SPEED"" -> E at position 3 and 4? And ends with D. But we don\'t know if we can have two E\'s? We don\'t have information about duplicate letters. However, we know the word has at least one E.\n\n But to maximize information, we should use distinct letters if possible. However, ""SPEED"" has two E\'s and two of the same letter might not be as informative.\n\n How about ""SPIEL""? That\'s a word: S, P, I, E, L. E is in the 4th position. This avoids the 5th position and doesn\'t use A, C, R, N.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the absent letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end, which we must avoid.\n\n How about ""STYLE""? S, T, Y, L, E -> again E at the end.\n\n We need E not at the end.\n\n Let me think of words with E in the middle.\n\n Words: \n   Position 1: EDITS, ECLAT (but ECLAT has C and A, which are absent) -> not allowed.\n   Position 2: HELLO -> H, E, L, L, O -> but two L\'s? And we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we haven\'t tested H, L, O.\n\n   But we can use: ""HEIST"" -> H, E, I, S, T. E is in position 2. This seems good.\n\n   ""HEIST"" does not contain A, C, R, N. It has H, E, I, S, T.\n\n   Another: ""DEBIT"" -> D, E, B, I, T. E in position 2.\n\n   ""DEBIT"" is also a valid word.\n\n   Which one is better? Both are good. We can choose one.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PESTO"" -> P, E, S, T, O. E in position 2.\n\n   But note: we want to test as many common letters as possible. The letters in ""HEIST"" are H, E, I, S, T. The letters in ""DEBIT"" are D, E, B, I, T. The letters in ""PESTO"" are P, E, S, T, O.\n\n   Since we already know E is in the word, we are testing 4 new letters in each.\n\n   Common letters: S, T, H, I, D, B, P, O.\n\n   I think ""HEIST"" is a good choice because it has S and T which are very common.\n\n   But note: we are not sure if the word has H, I, S, T.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven\'t tested. We only tested E at position 5. So we can test E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n   I think ""HEIST"" is a solid choice.\n\n   However, let me check if there\'s a word that uses more vowels? We know the word has at least one E, but we don\'t know about other vowels. We haven\'t tested O, U, I.\n\n   ""HEIST"" has E and I.\n\n   Another option: ""MOUSE"" -> but E is at the end, which we avoid.\n\n   ""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> E is at position 4. This is acceptable. And it tests T, O, W, E, L.\n\n   But we don\'t know if O, W, L are in the word.\n\n   I think ""TOWEL"" is also a good candidate.\n\n   However, we must avoid the absent letters: A, C, R, N. ""TOWEL"" does not contain these.\n\n   But note: we are trying to find the position of E. In ""TOWEL"", E is at position 4. In ""HEIST"", E is at position 2.\n\n   We don\'t have any information about the position of E, so either is fine.\n\n   I think I\'ll go with ""HEIST"" because it has common letters and we can get more information.\n\n   So, second guess: ""HEIST""\n\n   We\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\n   But note: we must not use the absent letters. We are safe with H, E, I, S, T.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""HEIST"".\n\n<guess>heist</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E** (since it\'s in the word), but **not in position 5**.\n- Must **avoid** C, R, A, and N entirely.\n- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, H) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""heist""** fits these criteria:\n- Contains **E** in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: H, I, S, T.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and the incorrect E position (5th).\n\n<guess>heist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: heist -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n  - C, R, A, N are not in the word.\n  - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nGuess 2: ""heist"" -> H(x) E(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)\nMeaning:\n  - H, I, S, T are not in the word.\n  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n\nFrom the second guess, we know that E is in position 2 (because we got a check for E at the second position).\n\nSo, the secret word has the form: _ E _ _ _\n\nWe also know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, I, S, T.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Has E in the second position (since we know it\'s correct and fixed there).\n- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.\n- Uses new letters to get more information.\n\nAvailable letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 we\'ve used (C,R,A,N,E,H,I,S,T) and E is fixed so we don\'t need to test it again, but we are including it in position 2. Actually, we have to avoid the absent letters, but E is present and fixed.\n\nSo, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T.\n\nWe can use any letter except these. Also, we know E is in position 2, so we must have E in the second position.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word of the form: _ E _ _ _\n\nWe should try to use common letters that we haven\'t tested yet, such as: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to maximize information, so we should try to use as many new common letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern _ E _ _ _ and use only the available letters.\n\nSome examples:\n- ""DEUCE"" -> but E is at position 2? D E U C E -> but C is absent (from first guess) and also has E at the end which we don\'t know about, but we are avoiding C. So invalid because of C.\n- ""BELOW"" -> B E L O W -> but we have E in position 2. And letters: B, E, L, O, W. Check absent: B is not in the absent list, L is not, O is not, W is not. So this is a candidate.\n- ""BELIE"" -> B E L I E -> but I is absent (from second guess) and also has E at the end. So invalid because of I.\n- ""BEVEL"" -> B E V E L -> has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. However, we are avoiding absent letters: V and L are not in the absent list. But note: we have E at the end? The pattern is _ E _ _ _, so BEVEL: position1=B, position2=E, position3=V, position4=E, position5=L. So it has E at position 2 and 4. We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s, but it\'s allowed. However, we are testing new letters: B, V, L. But we are repeating E, which we already know is in the word. It might be better to test all new letters.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible. So words without E in other positions might be better? But we don\'t know if there is another E.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid using E again to test other letters. But we have to put E in position 2.\n\nSo, the word must have E in position 2, and the other four positions should be new letters that are not absent and not E? But if the word has another E, that\'s okay, but we might not get information about that position.\n\nBut to maximize new information, we should try to use a word that has four new distinct letters (if possible) and no duplicates.\n\nSo, let\'s try to find a word of the form [letter1] E [letter2] [letter3] [letter4] where letter1, letter2, letter3, letter4 are from the available letters and distinct.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon letters: B, D, L, M, O, P, U, Y.\n\nWords:\n- ""BEDIM"" -> B E D I M -> but I is absent (from guess2). Invalid.\n- ""BEFOG"" -> B E F O G -> letters: B, F, O, G. All are available. This is a word? Yes, meaning to confuse. So: B E F O G.\n- ""BEGET"" -> B E G E T -> but T is absent (from guess2). Invalid.\n- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> I and N are absent. Invalid.\n- ""BEVEL"" -> as above, has two E\'s and we are testing V and L, but we have E again. Not ideal because we are using E again which we already know.\n- ""BEVY"" -> too short? 5 letters? No, BEVY is 4 letters.\n- ""DEUCE"" -> invalid because of C and U? C is absent, but U is available? But C is absent so invalid.\n- ""DELVE"" -> D E L V E -> again two E\'s. And we are testing D, L, V. But we have E at the end. We don\'t know if E is at the end? Actually, we know E is not at the end because in the first guess ""crane"" had E at the end and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word does not have E at the end. Therefore, we cannot have a word with E in the 5th position. So ""DELVE"" has E at the end -> invalid because we know E is not in position 5.\n\nSo we must avoid position 5 for E? Yes, because we know from the first guess that E is not in position 5. So any word that has E in position 5 is invalid for guessing because it violates the known fact.\n\nTherefore, we must choose a word that has E in position 2 and does not have E in any other position? Not necessarily, but if we put E in position 5, we know it\'s wrong, so it would be a waste. But we are forced by the word choice? Actually, we can avoid words that have E in position 5.\n\nSo, back to ""BEFOG"": B E F O G -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:F, 4:O, 5:G. No E in position 5. And no absent letters. This is a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""BEMUD"" -> not a common word.\n\n""BEPAT"" -> not a word.\n\n""BOWEL"" -> B O W E L -> but E is in position 4? We need E in position 2. So this doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nWe need E in position 2.\n\nAnother: ""DEBAR"" -> D E B A R -> but A and R are absent. Invalid.\n\n""DEBUG"" -> D E B U G -> letters: D, E, B, U, G. All available? D, B, U, G are not in the absent list. And no E in position 5. So ""DEBUG"" is a word (meaning to remove bugs). So: D E B U G.\n\nBut note: we are using D, B, U, G. That\'s four new letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""BEFOG"" uses F, O, G.\n\nWhich one is better? Both are valid.\n\nWe can also consider ""DEMOB"" -> D E M O B -> same letters as above? D, E, M, O, B. M and O are available.\n\nBut we have B and D in both? Actually, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe have two candidates: ""DEBUG"" and ""BEFOG"".\n\n""DEBUG"": tests D, B, U, G.\n""BEFOG"": tests B, F, O, G.\n\nCommon letters: B and G are in both? But we are testing different sets.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should prioritize the most common letters. Common letters in English: among the available ones, B, D, F, G, L, M, O, P, U, Y.\n\nSo, ""DEBUG"" has B, D, U, G -> common letters: B, D, G, U (U is less common).\n""BEFOG"" has B, F, O, G -> common letters: B, F, O, G.\n\nF and O are quite common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BEMIX"" -> not a word? Or ""BEMUD"" not common.\n\n""BEGUM"" -> B E G U M -> letters: B, G, U, M. This is a word (a Muslim woman). So: B E G U M.\n\nThis tests B, G, U, M.\n\nBut we have multiple options.\n\nWe can also consider ""PEDAL"" -> P E D A L -> but A is absent. Invalid.\n\n""LEVEL"" -> L E V E L -> has two E\'s and two L\'s? And E at the end? But we know E is not at the end. Also, we are repeating letters. Not ideal.\n\n""JEWEL"" -> J E W E L -> again two E\'s and E at the end? We know E is not at the end. So invalid.\n\n""MELEE"" -> M E L E E -> multiple E\'s and ends with E -> invalid.\n\nSo, let\'s stick with words without E in other positions and without absent letters.\n\nAnother word: ""FECAL"" -> F E C A L -> C and A are absent. Invalid.\n\n""BEFIT"" -> B E F I T -> I and T are absent (from guess2). Invalid.\n\nSo, we have a few candidates: ""DEBUG"", ""BEFOG"", ""BEGUM"", and maybe ""DEBUT"" -> D E B U T -> but T is absent. Invalid.\n\n""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> N is absent. Invalid.\n\n""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> N absent.\n\nSo, ""DEBUG"" and ""BEFOG"" and ""BEGUM"" are among the few.\n\nAnother: ""BEHOW"" -> not a word.\n\n""BEVUE"" -> not common and has E at the end.\n\n""BEDEW"" -> B E D E W -> two E\'s and we don\'t know if there\'s a second E. Also, we are testing B, D, W. But we have E again. And we know E is not at the end? Position 5 is W, so that\'s okay. But we have E at position 4? We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. But we are trying to avoid using E again to get more new letters.\n\nSo, I think ""BEFOG"" is a good choice because it has four new letters: B, F, O, G.\n\nSimilarly, ""DEBUG"" has B, D, U, G.\n\nBut note: we are testing B in both. We don\'t know if B is in the word. We are testing it.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""BEFOG"" because it has O and F which are common.\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that uses more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""BELOW"" -> B E L O W -> we considered earlier. It has E in position 2, and letters B, L, O, W. All available. And no E elsewhere. This is a good candidate.\n\n""BELOW"" is a common word and tests B, L, O, W.\n\nSimilarly, ""MELLOW"" is 6 letters.\n\nSo, now we have:\n- ""BEFOG"": B, F, O, G\n- ""DEBUG"": B, D, U, G\n- ""BEGUM"": B, G, U, M\n- ""BELOW"": B, L, O, W\n\nWhich one to choose? We should choose the one that has the most common letters.\n\nCommon letters in English words: among the available, the frequencies: E is already known, then T is out, so next are: O, L, D, M, F, etc.\n\nBut we don\'t have T, so O and L are very common.\n\nTherefore, ""BELOW"" has L and O, which are very common, and also B and W.\n\nSo, ""BELOW"" might be a better choice.\n\nWe can also consider ""MELON"" -> M E L O N -> but N is absent. Invalid.\n\n""HELLO"" -> H is absent.\n\nSo, ""BELOW"" seems good.\n\nBut note: we must avoid the absent letters. ""BELOW"" has B, E, L, O, W. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,N,H,I,S,T). So it\'s valid.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""BELOW"".\n\nSo, third guess: ""BELOW""\n\n<guess>below</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n- **E is confirmed in position 2** (from Guess 2: ""heist"" → E(✓)).\n- The secret word has the structure: `_ E _ _ _`.\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T (cannot be used).\n- **E cannot be in position 5** (from Guess 1: ""crane"" → E(-)).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E in position 2**.\n- Must avoid all absent letters (C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T).\n- Should prioritize testing new, common letters (e.g., B, L, O, W, D, F, G, M, P, U, Y) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""below""** fits perfectly:\n- **E is in position 2** (required).\n- Uses new, common letters: **B, L, O, W** (all untested and not absent).\n- Avoids E in position 5 and all forbidden letters.\n- Tests for potential vowels (O) and consonants (B, L, W) in unknown positions.\n\n<guess>below</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: heist -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n  - So, E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""heist"" -> H(x), E(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)\n  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n\nGuess 3: ""below"" -> B(x), E(✓), L(x), O(x), W(x)\n  - E is again correct in position 2 (as expected), and B, L, O, W are not in the word.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n- The secret word is of the form: _ E _ _ _ (since E is fixed at position 2).\n- Absent letters (not in the word at all): C, R, A, N, H, I, S, T, B, L, O, W.\n\nThus, the letters we cannot use are: A, B, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, W.\n\nWe have used 11 letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, I, S, T, B, L, O, W (E is present, but the rest are absent).\n\nAvailable letters: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: we know E is in the word and fixed at position 2, so we only need to fill the other four positions with letters from the available list, but we must also remember that E might be the only vowel? However, we don\'t know that. The word could have other vowels that we haven\'t tested? We\'ve tested A, I, O and they are absent. Vowels in English: A, E, I, O, U. We know:\n- A, I, O are absent (from feedback).\n- E is present.\n- U is still unknown (and available).\n\nSo, the word must contain at least E (and possibly U or other vowels? But we\'ve tested A, I, O and they are not in the word. So the remaining vowel is U? Or Y? Since Y can sometimes be a vowel.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must have E and either U or Y (or possibly no other vowels if the other letters are consonants? But every word must have a vowel? Not necessarily, but typically. We have E, so that might be enough? But we have to form a valid English word.\n\nStructure: _ E _ _ _\n\nThe positions 1, 3, 4, 5 must be filled with letters from: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also know that E is not in position 5, which is already satisfied.\n\nGiven that many common letters are used up, we need to choose a word that uses available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- We need to consider that U might be important.\n\nList of candidate words that are 5 letters, start with E in the second position, and use only available letters.\n\nExamples:\n- ""DEBUG"" was a candidate but B is absent? Wait, from guess3, B is absent. So we cannot use B.\n\nWe must avoid all absent letters: A, B, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, W.\n\nSo, available: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, words:\n- ""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> but O and N are absent (N from guess1, O from guess3). So invalid.\n- ""FEUED"" -> F E U E D -> has two E\'s? and E is in position 4? We know E is not in position 5, but we don\'t know about position 4. However, the word must be _ E _ _ _ so positions: 1=F, 2=E, 3=U, 4=E, 5=D. But we already know E is only in position 2? Wait, no, the feedback told us E is in the word and in position 2, but there could be more E\'s? However, in guess1, E was marked present but wrong position (so if there was another E in position 5, it would have been marked absent? but it was marked with \'-\' meaning present but wrong position. Since position 5 was wrong, and we now have E fixed at 2, it is possible that there is another E elsewhere? But in guess1, ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. That E could be at another position. But we now know position 2 is E, so the E in guess1 could be the same E? But then why was it marked as \'-\'? Because it was at the wrong position, and position 2 was not guessed then.\n\nActually, the E at position 5 in guess1 and the E at position 2 are the same? Not necessarily, the word could have two E\'s. But we don\'t have information on that.\n\nIn guess2, we got E at position 2 correct, and no other letters were marked present. Similarly in guess3, only E was correct. So it\'s possible the word has only one E? Or more? We don\'t know.\n\nSo, we should allow for the possibility of another E? But we are trying to get new information, so it might be inefficient to guess a letter we already know is present? But if there is another E, we need to find its position.\n\nHowever, we know that position 5 cannot be E? Actually, from guess1: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position. So the E at position 5 is not correct, meaning the word does have another E or the same E? Wait, but if the word has E at position 2, then guess1\'s E at position 5 was correctly identified as present (because E is in the word) but in the wrong position (because it\'s at position 5 but should be at position 2). So if there\'s only one E, the \'-\' in guess1 indicates that E is not in position 5. But if there were two E\'s, then even if position 5 has E, it would be correct? No, because if the word has E at position 5 and E at position 2, then in guess1 ""crane"" with E at position 5 would get a \'-\' if position 5 is not the only position for E? Actually, the feedback marks each letter individually. So for the E at position 5 in ""crane"", if the word has E at position 5, it would have been marked with \'✓\'. But it was marked with \'-\', meaning that E is in the word but not in position 5. So regardless of whether there is another E or not, position 5 is not E.\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- Position 5 ≠ E.\n- Position 2 = E.\n\nSo, if we want to include another E in our guess, it must be in positions 3 or 4? But we don\'t know if that E exists.\n\nBut to be efficient, we should avoid repeating E? Because testing new letters is more informative.\n\nSo, we are looking for a word with E in position 2 and other positions having letters from the available set, without E elsewhere.\n\nSo, pattern: [not E or absent] E [not E or absent] [not E or absent] [not E or absent]\n\nAnd all letters from: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (and we must avoid absent letters).\n\nLet me try to find words that fit.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""DEPTH"" -> D E P T H -> but T and H are absent (from guess2). Invalid.\n- ""DELVE"" -> D E L V E -> L is absent (from guess3) and also has E at the end? But we know position 5 cannot be E, so it would be incorrect, but also L is absent. Invalid.\n- ""DEFER"" -> D E F E R -> but R is absent (from guess1) and also repeated E.\n- ""DEUCE"" -> D E U C E -> C is absent (from guess1) and has E at end? Invalid.\n- ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> I and N absent.\n- ""DEMUR"" -> D E M U R -> R absent.\n- ""DEVIL"" -> D E V I L -> I and L absent.\n\nWe are having a problem because many words use I, O, etc. which are absent.\n\nLet\'s think of words with only the available letters and no absent ones.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""DECKED"" -> too long? 6 letters. We need 5.\n\nWhat about ""DEUCE"" already invalid.\n\n""JEWEL"" -> J E W E L -> but W and L are absent? W absent from guess3, L from guess3. Invalid.\n\n""MEADOW"" -> M E A D O W -> A and O and W absent? A from guess1, O from guess3, W from guess3. Invalid.\n\n""MEDIA"" -> M E D I A -> I and A absent. Invalid.\n\nIt seems we must consider less common words.\n\nWhat about ""DUMKY"" -> is this a word? Not really.\n\n""UMPED"" -> U M P E D -> E is at position 4? Pattern: U M P E D -> positions: 1=U, 2=E? We need position 2=E, so not.\n\nPattern must be: position1: any available letter, position2=E, position3: available, position4: available, position5: available.\n\nSo, let\'s look for words with E in the second position and the other letters from: D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nAnd these words must be valid English words.\n\nExamples:\n- ""KEVEL"" -> K E V E L -> L absent? L is absent. And also two E\'s? But L is absent from guess3.\n\nSo, invalid.\n\n""PECID"" -> not a word.\n\n""PEWED"" -> P E W E D -> W absent? From guess3, W is absent. Invalid.\n\n""VEXED"" -> V E X E D -> two E\'s? and E at position 4? So, positions: 1=V, 2=E, 3=X, 4=E, 5=D. This has E at position 4. Also, V, X, D are available? Check: V not absent, X not absent, D not absent. So, this is a valid word? Yes, ""vexed"" meaning annoyed.\n\nBut we have E at position 2 and also position 4. We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? But we are testing it.\n\nHowever, we are using E twice, which means we are only testing three new letters: V, X, D.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to avoid E to get more new letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DUVET"" -> D U V E T -> but E is at position 4? We need E at position 2: the pattern must be _ E _ _ _. So ""DUVET"" is D U V E T -> positions: 1=D, 2=U, 3=V, 4=E, 5=T -> no E at position 2. So not matching.\n\nWe need E at position 2.\n\nAnother try: ""VEZIR"" -> not common.\n\n""YUZUS"" -> not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""QUEME"" -> Q U E M E -> but E at position 3 and 5? We need E at position 2.\n\nNot.\n\n""JEMBE"" -> J E M B E -> but B is absent. And two E\'s.\n\nInvalid because B absent.\n\n""MADGE"" -> M A D G E -> A absent.\n\n""PYGMY"" -> P Y G M Y -> no E? Cannot.\n\nI think it\'s tough. Another option: ""FEMUR"" -> F E M U R -> R is absent. Invalid.\n\nBut we found ""vexed"": V E X E D.\n\nBut ""vexed"" uses W? No, V E X E D: letters V, E, X, D.\n\nAll are available (not in the absent list).\n\nSo, we can use ""vexed"".\n\nBut we are repeating E, not ideal for information.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DEKKO"" -> not standard.\n\n""PERCE?"" Not.\n\n""PEKED"" -> P E K E D -> two E\'s, and P, K, D are available? P, K, D not absent. So ""peked"" might be a word? Meaning (peke is a dog, but ""peked"" as adjective? not common).\n\n""GEMMY"" -> G E M M Y -> two M\'s? but pattern: G E M M Y -> E at position 2, but not E elsewhere.\n\nLetters: G, E, M, Y.\n\nAll available.\n\nAnd it\'s a valid word (like gemmy means full of gems or something).\n\nSimilarly, ""MEM"" is not 5 letters.\n\nAnother one: ""KEMP"" not 5.\n\nSo, ""gemmy"" is G E M M Y -> positions: 1=G, 2=E, 3=M, 4=M, 5=Y.\n\nWe are testing G, M, Y? But M is repeated, so we test G, M, Y.\n\nOr ""jemmy"" which is J E M M Y -> but J E M M Y is a word (meaning a crowbar or something).\n\n""jemmy"" has J, E, M, Y.\n\nJ is available? Yes.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested J.\n\nHowever, repeated M? But still, we are testing three new letters.\n\nBut we are not testing any potential vowels? We suspect U might be in the word? We don\'t know.\n\nAnother word: ""DEBUG"" but B is absent.\n\n""DEKKO"" not common.\n\nPerhaps ""DEFY"" is 4 letters.\n\n""JUPON"" -> J U P O N -> O and N absent? O from guess3, N from guess1.\n\nInvalid.\n\nI think ""vexed"" V E X E D and ""gemmy"" G E M M Y or ""jemmy"" J E M M Y are options, but they have duplicate letters.\n\nAnother one: ""VEZIR"" as ""MEZER"" not common.\n\n""DEIFY"" -> D E I F Y -> but I is absent? From guess2.\n\nInvalid.\n\n""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> O and N absent.\n\nSo, alternative: ""VEGAN"" -> V E G A N -> A and N absent.\n\nInvalid.\n\nPerhaps we must consider that the word might have U.\n\nWord: ""MUCID"" -> M U C I D -> C and I absent. No E at position 2.\n\nNot.\n\nWe need E at position 2, so let\'s think of words like:\n\n- U E _ _ _ : like ""UEL-? "" not common.\n\n- P E _ _ _ : ""PEGGY"" -> P E G G Y -> G repeated? Not.\n\n""PUPED"" -> P E? P U P E D -> no.\n\nI think ""vexed"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nOr perhaps ""JEEZE"" -> J E E Z E -> too many E\'s.\n\nWe need to accept that we might have to use a word with repeated letters or with E again.\n\nBut let\'s try to find a word without E in other positions.\n\nFor example, ""DEWX?"" not a word.\n\n""GEMEL"" -> G E M E L -> L is absent? And has E at position 4.\n\nBut L absent, so invalid.\n\n""FEDER"" -> F E D E R -> R absent.\n\n""DEMIT"" -> D E M I T -> I and T absent.\n\n""KEYED"" -> K E Y E D -> has E at position 2 and 4? And D. But Y and K are available. So ""KEYED"" K E Y E D.\n\nLetters: K, E, Y, D.\n\nY and D are available? Yes.\n\nK is available? Yes.\n\nBut two E\'s? Yes.\n\nBut we are testing K, Y, D.\n\nPositions: 1=K, 2=E, 3=Y, 4=E, 5=D.\n\nHowever, we know position 5 cannot be E? We have E at position 4, which is not position 5, so that\'s allowed? But we are guessing E at position 4, which is not position 5. So it\'s valid.\n\nBut will we get separate feedback for each E? Yes.\n\nBut we are using two E\'s, so we might be not testing as many new letters.\n\nAnother option: ""HEEDS"" -> but H absent.\n\n""DEEMS"" -> S absent.\n\n""VEKKER"" not 5.\n\nPerhaps ""QUEUE"" -> Q U E U E -> E at position 3? _ E _ _ _ not matched.\n\nWe need E at position 2.\n\nSo, I think ""KEYED"" is a word? Yes, meaning to have provided with keys or operated by keys.\n\nAnd it fits: K E Y E D.\n\nAnother: ""JEYED"" -> not common.\n\nOr ""PEEBY"" -> P E E B Y -> B is absent.\n\nSo, ""KEYED"" is K E Y E D.\n\nTested letters: K, Y, D (and E twice).\n\nSimilarly, ""VEXED"" V E X E D.\n\nBetween ""KEYED"" and ""VEXED"", we can choose one.\n\nOr without E duplicate?\n\nLet\'s search for a word with four new letters and no E elsewhere.\n\nWhat about ""DUXE D "" D U X E D -> no E at position 2.\n\nHow about ""PEG UN"" not a word.\n\n""GUD GE"" not.\n\n""DUMPY"" -> D U M P Y -> no E, not applicable.\n\nWe must have E at position 2.\n\nThe only words I can think of without using absent letters and without E duplicate are few.\n\nFor example:\n- ""DEXES"" -> D E X E S -> S absent? S absent from guess2.\n\nIn ""DEXES"", S is at the end? S? But S is absent, so invalid.\n\n""FEEZE"" -> F E E Z E -> two E\'s.\n\n"" JEEPS"" -> J E E P S? S absent.\n\n""MYKT E"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""QUEY?"" Q U E Y -> 4 letters.\n\nI think it\'s hard to find, so maybe we should go with a word that has E only at position 2 and the letter U in one of the position.\n\nFor example, ""DEBUS"" -> D E B U S -> B and S absent. Invalid.\n\n""DEPUD"" not a word.\n\n""EMEU"" not 5.\n\nWe might have to use ""vexed"".\n\nAnother common word: ""bevel"" but B and L absent.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""VEXED"" or ""KEYED"".\n\nOr ""GEMUL"" not a word.\n\nLet\'s choose ""KEYED"": K E Y E D.\n\nBut we are repeating E, which might not give us new information. However, we might discover if there is an E at position 4.\n\nBut we know from guess1 that E is not at position 5, but position 4 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, position 3 is possible.\n\nSo, we can gain position information for E.\n\nBut we already know E is at position 2, and if we get a \'-\' for position 4 E, then we know there is an E at another position? No, but the word might have at least. However, our goal is to find all the letters that are in the word.\n\nGiven that we have few guesses left, we should try to test as many new letters as possible, so avoiding E elsewhere is better.\n\nBut is there a word that has E only in position 2 and other positions with available letters and no duplicate?\n\nFor example, ""MUD"" not 5.\n\nLet\'s try: "" D E U G?"" not a word.\n\n""G UE R R"" not.\n\n"" P E G U X"" not common.\n\nPerhaps ""DEFY"" is 4.\n\nWe need to consider ""QUERY"" but we have position 2 requirement.\n\nAnother idea: What about ""QUEUD"" not a word.\n\n"" DUET"" is 4 letters.\n\nI think we might have to use a word like ""JUDGE"" but J U D G E -> pattern: J U D G E -> position 2=U, not E.\n\nNot matched.\n\nSo, perhaps the only practical choice is to use a word with another E.\n\nConsider ""DEEKED"" too long.\n\nSo, I will go with ""KEYED"", testing K, Y, D.\n\nBut another better option? ""VEXED"" and ""KEYED"" both have two E\'s.\n\nOr ""DEQUE"" -> D E Q U E -> two E\'s, and Q and U.\n\nBut ""deque"" is a valid word (double-ended queue).\n\nLetters: D, E, Q, U.\n\nAll available? D, Q, U are available.\n\nNo absent letters.\n\nSo, ""deque"" D E Q U E.\n\nPositions: 1=D, 2=E, 3=Q, 4=U, 5=E.\n\nWe are testing D, Q, U.\n\nBut once again two E\'s.\n\nBut we are testing Q and U, which are less common.\n\nOr ""GUE"" not.\n\n"" M E Q U "" not.\n\nSo, between the options:\n\n- ""vexed"" (V E X E D): tests V, X, D\n- ""keyed"" (K E Y E D): tests K, Y, D\n- ""deque"" (D E Q U E): tests D, Q, U\n\nWe should choose based on most common letters? But V, X, K, Y, Q, U are all not very common.\n\nHowever, U is a vowel and might be more likely.\n\nPerhaps the word is ""EMEND"" but E in position 1?

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""heist"" -> H(x), E(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).

Guess 3: ""below"" -> B(x), E(✓), L(x), O(x), W(x)
  - E is again correct in position 2, and B, L, O, W are absent.

Guess 4: ""vexed"" -> V(x), E(✓), X(x), E(-), D(x)
  - E is correct in position 2 (as expected).
  - The second E (in position 4) is present but in the wrong position (marked '-'). This means there is another E in the word, but not in position 4.
  - V, X, D are absent.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word has the form: _ E _ _ _
- We know there are at least two E's: one fixed at position 2, and another one that is not in position 4 (and not in position 5, from guess1).
- Absent letters: A, B, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, W, V, X, D.

Now, the absent letters are: A, B, C, D, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, V, W, X.

Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z.

But note: we have two E's in the word. The second E must be in position 1 or 3 (since position 2 is taken, position 4 is wrong, and position 5 is also wrong from guess1).

So, the secret word has E in position 2, and another E in either position 1 or position 3.

Therefore, the possible patterns are:
- E E _ _ _  (E at position 1 and 2)
- _ E E _ _  (E at position 2 and 3)

But note: in pattern E E _ _ _, the first two letters are E. In pattern _ E E _ _, the second and third are E.

We need to form a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only the available letters for the non-E positions.

Available letters for non-E positions: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: Pattern ""E E _ _ _""
  - The word starts with ""EE"", which is uncommon. We need to find words that start with ""EE"" and have 5 letters.
  - Examples: 
      - ""EERIE"" -> E E R I E -> but R and I are absent (R from guess1, I from guess2). Invalid.
      - ""EELED"" -> E E L E D -> L and D absent. Invalid.
      - ""EENSY"" -> E E N S Y -> N and S absent. Invalid.
      - ""EEJIT"" -> E E J I T -> I and T absent. Invalid.
  - It's hard to find a word starting with ""EE"" that doesn't use absent letters. The available letters for positions 3,4,5 are F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z.
  - Possible? ""EEGUE"" not a word. ""EEMU"" not 5 letters. ""EEKED"" -> E E K E D -> D absent. 
  - This case seems unlikely.

Case 2: Pattern ""_ E E _ _""
  - The word has the second and third letters as E, so pattern: [letter] E E [letter] [letter]
  - The first letter must be a consonant (since two E's are already vowels) and from available letters: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z.
  - The last two letters also from available letters.

Examples of words with pattern _ E E _:
  - ""FLEER"" -> F L E E R -> L and R absent. Invalid.
  - ""SLEET"" -> S L E E T -> S, L, T absent. Invalid.
  - ""CREEP"" -> C R E E P -> C, R absent. Invalid.
  - ""QUEEN"" -> Q U E E N -> N absent. Invalid.
  - ""QUEER"" -> Q U E E R -> R absent. Invalid.
  - ""BEECH"" -> B E E C H -> B, C, H absent. Invalid.
  - ""LEECH"" -> L E E C H -> L, C, H absent. Invalid.
  - ""MEETS"" -> M E E T S -> T, S absent. Invalid.

We need to use only available letters.

Available: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z.

So, let's try:
  - ""QUEEN"" -> Q U E E N -> N absent -> invalid.
  - ""QUEER"" -> Q U E E R -> R absent -> invalid.
  - ""QUEUE"" -> Q U E U E -> This is 5 letters: Q U E U E -> pattern: position1=Q, 2=U, 3=E, 4=U, 5=E -> but we need position 2 and 3 to be E? Here position 3 is E, but position 2 is U, not E. So pattern is _ E E _ _ meaning position2=E and position3=E. In ""QUEUE"", position2 is U, position3 is E. So not matching.

We need a word where the second and third letters are E.

So, the word must be: [F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,U,Y,Z] E E [F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,U,Y,Z] [F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,U,Y,Z]

And it must be a valid English word.

Let's list possibilities:
  - ""JEEPS"" -> J E E P S -> S absent -> invalid.
  - ""MEEPS"" -> not a word.
  - ""FEEKS"" -> F E E K S -> S absent -> invalid.
  - ""GEEKS"" -> G E E K S -> S absent -> invalid.
  - ""KEEPS"" -> K E E P S -> S absent -> invalid.
  - ""PEEKS"" -> P E E K S -> S absent -> invalid.
  - ""QUEYS"" -> Q U E Y S -> but pattern: Q U E Y S -> position2=U, not E -> doesn't match pattern _ E E _ _.

We need the second letter to be E and the third to be E.

So, the first letter must be a consonant, then ""EE"", then two more letters.

But with the available letters, and avoiding S, T, etc. which are absent.

What about ""MEED"" not 5 letters.

""JEE"" not.

Perhaps ""BEEN"" -> B E E N -> B and N absent.

Invalid.

""KEEN"" -> K E E N -> N absent.

Invalid.

""PEEN"" -> P E E N -> N absent.

Invalid.

""REEN"" -> R E E N -> R and N absent.

Invalid.

""SEEP"" -> S E E P -> S absent.

Invalid.

""WEEP"" -> W E E P -> W absent.

Invalid.

""YEE"" not 5.

""ZEE"" not.

This is difficult.

Another idea: perhaps the second E is not in position 3, but in position 1? We considered pattern ""E E _ _ _"", but let's revisit.

In pattern ""E E _ _ _"", we have:
  - Position1: E
  - Position2: E (fixed)
  - Position3,4,5: from available letters.

But we need a word starting with ""EE"".

Words: 
  - ""EERIE"" -> invalid due to R and I.
  - ""EELED"" -> invalid due to L and D.
  - ""EENSY"" -> invalid due to N and S.
  - ""EEVEN"" -> not a word.
  - ""EEVEE"" -> E E V E E -> V absent (from guess4) and also has E at position 4 and 5? But we know position 5 cannot be E. Also, V is absent.

But let's think: are there any words starting with ""EE"" that use only the available letters?

Available: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z.

So, ""EE"" followed by three of these.

For example:
  - ""EEF"" not 5.
  - ""EEG"" not.
  - ""EEK"" -> then we need two more letters? ""EEKED"" -> E E K E D -> D absent.
  - ""EEKEE"" -> not a word.
  - ""EEMU"" not 5.
  - ""EEP"" -> ""EEPED"" -> E E P E D -> D absent.
  - ""EEQU"" not.
  - ""EEZE"" not a word.

It seems impossible to find a word starting with ""EE"" that doesn't use absent letters.

Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the second E is in position 3, but we are missing the word.

Perhaps we missed a word for pattern _ E E _ _.

Let me think of words that have the second and third letters as E and use only available letters for the others.

Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z.

So, the word is: [F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,U,Y,Z] E E [F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,U,Y,Z] [F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,U,Y,Z]

And it must be a valid English word.

Examples:
  - ""FEEZE"" -> F E E Z E -> This is a word (meaning to drive away or a variant of feeze). But it has E at position 5? Pattern: F E E Z E -> positions: 1=F, 2=E, 3=E, 4=Z, 5=E.

But we know from guess1 that position 5 cannot be E (because in ""crane"", E at position 5 was marked as present but wrong position). So if the word has E at position 5, it would be incorrect because we know E is not at position 5. Therefore, ""FEEZE"" has E at position 5, which is not allowed.

Similarly, any word with E at position 5 is invalid.

So, for pattern _ E E _ _, the last two positions cannot be E.

So, the last two positions must be from the available letters and not E.

So, the word is: [available] E E [available] [available] (none of these are E).

But we have to avoid E in positions 4 and 5.

So, let's list possible words:

  - ""GEEJU"" -> not a word.
  - ""JEEFU"" -> not.
  - ""KEEFU"" -> not.
  - ""MEEGU"" -> not.
  - ""PEEPY"" -> P E E P Y -> This is a word? ""peepy"" (meaning having a peeping sound or something). But it has P at position 1 and 4? Letters: P, E, E, P, Y. Available letters include P and Y. And no E in position 4 or 5? Position 4 is P, position 5 is Y. So no E. And P and Y are available.

So, ""PEEPY"" is P E E P Y.

Check absent letters: P and Y are not in the absent list. So valid.

Another: ""FEEPY"" not common.

""KEEPY"" not a word.

""QEE"" not.

""YEE"" not.

""ZEE"" not.

""MEETH"" -> M E E T H -> T and H absent.

Invalid.

""PEECE"" -> P E E C E -> C absent.

Invalid.

So, ""PEEPY"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""JEEPS"" but S absent.

""GEEKY"" -> G E E K Y -> This is a word. Letters: G, E, E, K, Y. All available? G, K, Y are available. And no E in position 4 or 5. Position 4=K, position 5=Y.

So, ""GEEKY"" is valid.

Similarly, ""FEEKY"" not common.

""KEEKY"" not.

So, we have at least two candidates: ""PEEPY"" and ""GEEKY"".

But ""peepy"" might be less common, while ""geeky"" is common.

Also, ""GEEKY"" uses G, K, Y.

""PEEPY"" uses P and Y (with P repeated).

We should choose ""GEEKY"" because it has distinct letters except for the E's.

But we are forced to have the E's.

So, let's go with ""GEEKY"".

But is ""geeky"" allowed in Wordle? It should be, as it's a valid English word.

Another candidate: ""MEEKY"" not a word.

""QUEEN"" not because of N.

So, ""GEEKY"" seems good.

But let's confirm the pattern: G E E K Y -> positions: 1=G, 2=E, 3=E, 4=K, 5=Y. This matches _ E E _ _.

And we are testing G, K, Y.

If this is not the word, we get information.

But note: we have only 2 guesses left (since we are on guess 5 out of 6).

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more letters, but in this case, we are constrained by the pattern.

Another candidate: ""PEEOY"" not a word.

""JEEKY"" not common.

So, I think ""GEEKY"" is a good guess.

But we have another possibility: the second E could be in position 1? But we couldn't find any word for ""E E _ _ _"" with available letters.

Perhaps we missed a word.

For example, ""EEJIT"" is a word but has I and T.

Or ""EEKED"" has D.

But no.

Another idea: perhaps the feedback for guess4 ""vexed"" has E at position 4 marked as '-' which means there is an E in the word but not in position 4. But it doesn't specify that it's a different E. It could be the same E? But we already have E at position 2, so if there is only one E, then the '-' for position 4 would be impossible because the E is at position 2. But the feedback for position 4 is '-' which means there is an E in the word that is not at position 4. Since we already have one E at position 2, this '-' must indicate a second E.

So, there are two E's.

Therefore, the only patterns are E E _ _ _ or _ E E _ _.

And we have a candidate for _ E E _ _ : ""GEEKY"".

So, let's guess ""GEEKY"".

But note: in ""GEEKY"", we are using G, E, E, K, Y. We know E is in the word, so we are testing G, K, Y.

If the word is not ""GEEKY"", we will get feedback on these letters.

So, fifth guess: ""GEEKY""

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)**  
  - **E is in the word but not in position 5**.  
  - Absent letters: C, R, A, N.

- **Guess 2: ""heist"" → Feedback: H(x), E(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)**  
  - **E is correct and in position 2**.  
  - Absent letters: H, I, S, T.

- **Guess 3: ""below"" → Feedback: B(x), E(✓), L(x), O(x), W(x)**  
  - **E is confirmed in position 2** (consistent with Guess 2).  
  - Absent letters: B, L, O, W.

- **Guess 4: ""vexed"" → Feedback: V(x), E(✓), X(x), E(-), D(x)**  
  - **E is confirmed in position 2** (consistent).  
  - **The second E (position 4) is present but misplaced** (indicating **a second E exists in the word, not in position 4 or 5**).  
  - Absent letters: V, X, D.

### Key Insights
1. **Word Structure**:  
   - Position 2 is **E** (fixed).  
   - There is **at least one more E** in the word (from Guess 4's feedback on position 4).  
   - The second E **cannot be in positions 4 or 5** (position 4 was marked ""wrong position"" in Guess 4; position 5 was ruled out in Guess 1).  
   - Thus, the second E must be in **position 1 or 3**, leading to two possible patterns:  
     - **E E _ _ _** (E in positions 1 and 2)  
     - **\_ E E _ _** (E in positions 2 and 3)  

2. **Absent Letters (15 total)**:  
   - A, B, C, D, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, V, W, X.  
   - **Available letters**: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z.  

3. **Constraints for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include **two E's** (one fixed at position 2, one in position 1 or 3).  
   - Non-E positions must use **only available letters** (F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z).  
   - Avoid E in positions 4 and 5 (ruled out by feedback).  
   - Prioritize testing new, common letters to maximize information.  

### Evaluation of Possible Patterns
- **Pattern 1: E E _ _ _**  
  - Words starting with ""EE"" are rare. After filtering for available letters:  
    - No valid words found (e.g., ""eerie"" uses absent R/I; ""eensy"" uses absent N/S; ""eeked"" uses absent D).  
  - **Conclusion**: This pattern is unlikely.  

- **Pattern 2: _ E E _ _**  
  - Words with E in positions 2 and 3.  
  - After filtering for available letters and avoiding E in positions 4/5:  
    - **""geeky"" (G E E K Y)**: Valid word. Tests G, K, Y (new letters).  
    - **""peepy"" (P E E P Y)**: Valid word, but repeats P (less informative).  
    - Other candidates like ""queen"" (N absent) or ""jeeps"" (S absent) are invalid.  
  - **Conclusion**: **""geeky"" is the strongest candidate**—it fits the pattern, uses distinct new letters (G, K, Y), and is a common word.  

### Why ""geeky""?
- **Structure**: Matches `_ E E _ _` (positions: 1=G, 2=E, 3=E, 4=K, 5=Y).  
- **Tests 3 new letters**: G, K, Y.  
- **Information gain**:  
  - Confirms if the second E is in position 3.  
  - Rules out G, K, Y if absent.  
- **Fallback**: If ""geeky"" is incorrect, feedback will reveal the position of the second E and the validity of G/K/Y, narrowing options for the final guess.

### Next Guess
<guess>geeky</guess>",geeky,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""heist"" -> H(x), E(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).

Guess 3: ""below"" -> B(x), E(✓), L(x), O(x), W(x)
  - E is again correct in position 2, and B, L, O, W are absent.

Guess 4: ""vexed"" -> V(x), E(✓), X(x), E(-), D(x)
  - E is correct in position 2 (as expected).
  - The second E (in position 4) is present but in the wrong position (marked '-'). This means there is another E in the word, but not in position 4.
  - V, X, D are absent.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word has the form: _ E _ _ _
- We know there are at least two E's: one fixed at position 2, and another one that is not in position 4 (and not in position 5, from guess1).
- Absent letters: A, B, C, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, W, V, X, D.

Now, the absent letters are: A, B, C, D, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, V, W, X.

Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z.

But note: we have two E's in the word. The second E must be in position 1 or 3 (since position 2 is taken, position 4 is wrong, and position 5 is also wrong from guess1).

So, the secret word has E in position 2, and another E in either position 1 or position 3.

Therefore, the possible patterns are:
- E E _ _ _  (E at position 1 and 2)
- _ E E _ _  (E at position 2 and 3)

But note: in pattern E E _ _ _, the first two letters are E. In pattern _ E E _ _, the second and third are E.

We need to form a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only the available letters for the non-E positions.

Available letters for non-E positions: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: Pattern ""E E _ _ _""
  - The word starts with ""EE"", which is uncommon. We need to find words that start with ""EE"" and have 5 letters.
  - Examples: 
      - ""EERIE"" -> E E R I E -> but R and I are absent (R from guess1, I from guess2). Invalid.
      - ""EELED"" -> E E L E D -> L and D absent. Invalid.
      - ""EENSY"" -> E E N S Y -> N and S absent. Invalid.
      - ""EEJIT"" -> E E J I T -> I and T absent. Invalid.
  - It's hard to find a word starting with ""EE"" that doesn't use absent letters. The available letters for positions 3,4,5 are F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z.
  - Possible? ""EEGUE"" not a word. ""EEMU"" not 5 letters. ""EEKED"" -> E E K E D -> D absent. 
  - This case seems unlikely.

Case 2: Pattern ""_ E E _ _""
  - The word has the second and third letters as E, so pattern: [letter] E E [letter] [letter]
  - The first letter must be a consonant (since two E's are already vowels) and from available letters: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z.
  - The last two letters also from available letters.

Examples of words with pattern _ E E _:
  - ""FLEER"" -> F L E E R -> L and R absent. Invalid.
  - ""SLEET"" -> S L E E T -> S, L, T absent. Invalid.
  - ""CREEP"" -> C R E E P -> C, R absent. Invalid.
  - ""QUEEN"" -> Q U E E N -> N absent. Invalid.
  - ""QUEER"" -> Q U E E R -> R absent. Invalid.
  - ""BEECH"" -> B E E C H -> B, C, H absent. Invalid.
  - ""LEECH"" -> L E E C H -> L, C, H absent. Invalid.
  - ""MEETS"" -> M E E T S -> T, S absent. Invalid.

We need to use only available letters.

Available: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z.

So, let's try:
  - ""QUEEN"" -> Q U E E N -> N absent -> invalid.
  - ""QUEER"" -> Q U E E R -> R absent -> invalid.
  - ""QUEUE"" -> Q U E U E -> This is 5 letters: Q U E U E -> pattern: position1=Q, 2=U, 3=E, 4=U, 5=E -> but we need position 2 and 3 to be E? Here position 3 is E, but position 2 is U, not E. So pattern is _ E E _ _ meaning position2=E and position3=E. In ""QUEUE"", position2 is U, position3 is E. So not matching.

We need a word where the second and third letters are E.

So, the word must be: [F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,U,Y,Z] E E [F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,U,Y,Z] [F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,U,Y,Z]

And it must be a valid English word.

Let's list possibilities:
  - ""JEEPS"" -> J E E P S -> S absent -> invalid.
  - ""MEEPS"" -> not a word.
  - ""FEEKS"" -> F E E K S -> S absent -> invalid.
  - ""GEEKS"" -> G E E K S -> S absent -> invalid.
  - ""KEEPS"" -> K E E P S -> S absent -> invalid.
  - ""PEEKS"" -> P E E K S -> S absent -> invalid.
  - ""QUEYS"" -> Q U E Y S -> but pattern: Q U E Y S -> position2=U, not E -> doesn't match pattern _ E E _ _.

We need the second letter to be E and the third to be E.

So, the first letter must be a consonant, then ""EE"", then two more letters.

But with the available letters, and avoiding S, T, etc. which are absent.

What about ""MEED"" not 5 letters.

""JEE"" not.

Perhaps ""BEEN"" -> B E E N -> B and N absent.

Invalid.

""KEEN"" -> K E E N -> N absent.

Invalid.

""PEEN"" -> P E E N -> N absent.

Invalid.

""REEN"" -> R E E N -> R and N absent.

Invalid.

""SEEP"" -> S E E P -> S absent.

Invalid.

""WEEP"" -> W E E P -> W absent.

Invalid.

""YEE"" not 5.

""ZEE"" not.

This is difficult.

Another idea: perhaps the second E is not in position 3, but in position 1? We considered pattern ""E E _ _ _"", but let's revisit.

In pattern ""E E _ _ _"", we have:
  - Position1: E
  - Position2: E (fixed)
  - Position3,4,5: from available letters.

But we need a word starting with ""EE"".

Words: 
  - ""EERIE"" -> invalid due to R and I.
  - ""EELED"" -> invalid due to L and D.
  - ""EENSY"" -> invalid due to N and S.
  - ""EEVEN"" -> not a word.
  - ""EEVEE"" -> E E V E E -> V absent (from guess4) and also has E at position 4 and 5? But we know position 5 cannot be E. Also, V is absent.

But let's think: are there any words starting with ""EE"" that use only the available letters?

Available: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z.

So, ""EE"" followed by three of these.

For example:
  - ""EEF"" not 5.
  - ""EEG"" not.
  - ""EEK"" -> then we need two more letters? ""EEKED"" -> E E K E D -> D absent.
  - ""EEKEE"" -> not a word.
  - ""EEMU"" not 5.
  - ""EEP"" -> ""EEPED"" -> E E P E D -> D absent.
  - ""EEQU"" not.
  - ""EEZE"" not a word.

It seems impossible to find a word starting with ""EE"" that doesn't use absent letters.

Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the second E is in position 3, but we are missing the word.

Perhaps we missed a word for pattern _ E E _ _.

Let me think of words that have the second and third letters as E and use only available letters for the others.

Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z.

So, the word is: [F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,U,Y,Z] E E [F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,U,Y,Z] [F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,U,Y,Z]

And it must be a valid English word.

Examples:
  - ""FEEZE"" -> F E E Z E -> This is a word (meaning to drive away or a variant of feeze). But it has E at position 5? Pattern: F E E Z E -> positions: 1=F, 2=E, 3=E, 4=Z, 5=E.

But we know from guess1 that position 5 cannot be E (because in ""crane"", E at position 5 was marked as present but wrong position). So if the word has E at position 5, it would be incorrect because we know E is not at position 5. Therefore, ""FEEZE"" has E at position 5, which is not allowed.

Similarly, any word with E at position 5 is invalid.

So, for pattern _ E E _ _, the last two positions cannot be E.

So, the last two positions must be from the available letters and not E.

So, the word is: [available] E E [available] [available] (none of these are E).

But we have to avoid E in positions 4 and 5.

So, let's list possible words:

  - ""GEEJU"" -> not a word.
  - ""JEEFU"" -> not.
  - ""KEEFU"" -> not.
  - ""MEEGU"" -> not.
  - ""PEEPY"" -> P E E P Y -> This is a word? ""peepy"" (meaning having a peeping sound or something). But it has P at position 1 and 4? Letters: P, E, E, P, Y. Available letters include P and Y. And no E in position 4 or 5? Position 4 is P, position 5 is Y. So no E. And P and Y are available.

So, ""PEEPY"" is P E E P Y.

Check absent letters: P and Y are not in the absent list. So valid.

Another: ""FEEPY"" not common.

""KEEPY"" not a word.

""QEE"" not.

""YEE"" not.

""ZEE"" not.

""MEETH"" -> M E E T H -> T and H absent.

Invalid.

""PEECE"" -> P E E C E -> C absent.

Invalid.

So, ""PEEPY"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""JEEPS"" but S absent.

""GEEKY"" -> G E E K Y -> This is a word. Letters: G, E, E, K, Y. All available? G, K, Y are available. And no E in position 4 or 5. Position 4=K, position 5=Y.

So, ""GEEKY"" is valid.

Similarly, ""FEEKY"" not common.

""KEEKY"" not.

So, we have at least two candidates: ""PEEPY"" and ""GEEKY"".

But ""peepy"" might be less common, while ""geeky"" is common.

Also, ""GEEKY"" uses G, K, Y.

""PEEPY"" uses P and Y (with P repeated).

We should choose ""GEEKY"" because it has distinct letters except for the E's.

But we are forced to have the E's.

So, let's go with ""GEEKY"".

But is ""geeky"" allowed in Wordle? It should be, as it's a valid English word.

Another candidate: ""MEEKY"" not a word.

""QUEEN"" not because of N.

So, ""GEEKY"" seems good.

But let's confirm the pattern: G E E K Y -> positions: 1=G, 2=E, 3=E, 4=K, 5=Y. This matches _ E E _ _.

And we are testing G, K, Y.

If this is not the word, we get information.

But note: we have only 2 guesses left (since we are on guess 5 out of 6).

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests more letters, but in this case, we are constrained by the pattern.

Another candidate: ""PEEOY"" not a word.

""JEEKY"" not common.

So, I think ""GEEKY"" is a good guess.

But we have another possibility: the second E could be in position 1? But we couldn't find any word for ""E E _ _ _"" with available letters.

Perhaps we missed a word.

For example, ""EEJIT"" is a word but has I and T.

Or ""EEKED"" has D.

But no.

Another idea: perhaps the feedback for guess4 ""vexed"" has E at position 4 marked as '-' which means there is an E in the word but not in position 4. But it doesn't specify that it's a different E. It could be the same E? But we already have E at position 2, so if there is only one E, then the '-' for position 4 would be impossible because the E is at position 2. But the feedback for position 4 is '-' which means there is an E in the word that is not at position 4. Since we already have one E at position 2, this '-' must indicate a second E.

So, there are two E's.

Therefore, the only patterns are E E _ _ _ or _ E E _ _.

And we have a candidate for _ E E _ _ : ""GEEKY"".

So, let's guess ""GEEKY"".

But note: in ""GEEKY"", we are using G, E, E, K, Y. We know E is in the word, so we are testing G, K, Y.

If the word is not ""GEEKY"", we will get feedback on these letters.

So, fifth guess: ""GEEKY""

<guess>geeky</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)**  
  - **E is in the word but not in position 5**.  
  - Absent letters: C, R, A, N.

- **Guess 2: ""heist"" → Feedback: H(x), E(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)**  
  - **E is correct and in position 2**.  
  - Absent letters: H, I, S, T.

- **Guess 3: ""below"" → Feedback: B(x), E(✓), L(x), O(x), W(x)**  
  - **E is confirmed in position 2** (consistent with Guess 2).  
  - Absent letters: B, L, O, W.

- **Guess 4: ""vexed"" → Feedback: V(x), E(✓), X(x), E(-), D(x)**  
  - **E is confirmed in position 2** (consistent).  
  - **The second E (position 4) is present but misplaced** (indicating **a second E exists in the word, not in position 4 or 5**).  
  - Absent letters: V, X, D.

### Key Insights
1. **Word Structure**:  
   - Position 2 is **E** (fixed).  
   - There is **at least one more E** in the word (from Guess 4's feedback on position 4).  
   - The second E **cannot be in positions 4 or 5** (position 4 was marked ""wrong position"" in Guess 4; position 5 was ruled out in Guess 1).  
   - Thus, the second E must be in **position 1 or 3**, leading to two possible patterns:  
     - **E E _ _ _** (E in positions 1 and 2)  
     - **\_ E E _ _** (E in positions 2 and 3)  

2. **Absent Letters (15 total)**:  
   - A, B, C, D, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, V, W, X.  
   - **Available letters**: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z.  

3. **Constraints for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include **two E's** (one fixed at position 2, one in position 1 or 3).  
   - Non-E positions must use **only available letters** (F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, Y, Z).  
   - Avoid E in positions 4 and 5 (ruled out by feedback).  
   - Prioritize testing new, common letters to maximize information.  

### Evaluation of Possible Patterns
- **Pattern 1: E E _ _ _**  
  - Words starting with ""EE"" are rare. After filtering for available letters:  
    - No valid words found (e.g., ""eerie"" uses absent R/I; ""eensy"" uses absent N/S; ""eeked"" uses absent D).  
  - **Conclusion**: This pattern is unlikely.  

- **Pattern 2: _ E E _ _**  
  - Words with E in positions 2 and 3.  
  - After filtering for available letters and avoiding E in positions 4/5:  
    - **""geeky"" (G E E K Y)**: Valid word. Tests G, K, Y (new letters).  
    - **""peepy"" (P E E P Y)**: Valid word, but repeats P (less informative).  
    - Other candidates like ""queen"" (N absent) or ""jeeps"" (S absent) are invalid.  
  - **Conclusion**: **""geeky"" is the strongest candidate**—it fits the pattern, uses distinct new letters (G, K, Y), and is a common word.  

### Why ""geeky""?
- **Structure**: Matches `_ E E _ _` (positions: 1=G, 2=E, 3=E, 4=K, 5=Y).  
- **Tests 3 new letters**: G, K, Y.  
- **Information gain**:  
  - Confirms if the second E is in position 3.  
  - Rules out G, K, Y if absent.  
- **Fallback**: If ""geeky"" is incorrect, feedback will reveal the position of the second E and the validity of G/K/Y, narrowing options for the final guess.
