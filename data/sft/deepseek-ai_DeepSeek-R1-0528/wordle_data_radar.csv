We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make a second guess.

 We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, N, E (because they are not in the secret word).
   - Contains R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

 Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

 We can also consider common letters to try to get more information.

 Since we know R and A are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions.

 Possibilities for R: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, A cannot be in position 3, so it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We might also want to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet, such as T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes some new common letters.

 Example: 
   We could try a word with R in the first position? But note: we don't know if R is in first or not. 
   However, we can try to put R in a different position than 2.

 One common word: ""PARTY"" -> but we have to check if it fits the constraints.
   P, A, R, T, Y.

 But note: in ""crane"", A was in position 3. Now in ""PARTY"", A is in position 2. That's allowed because the feedback only said A is in the word but not in position 3.

 However, we must avoid using C, N, E. ""PARTY"" doesn't have any of these.

 Let's check the positions:
   P in position 1: we don't know about P.
   A in position 2: we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 2? Actually, the feedback only said A is not in position 3. It could be in position 2.

 But wait: we also have R in position 3. In the first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong. Now we are putting R in position 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't know if position 3 is correct for R or not.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So position 3 might be correct.

 But let's see: if we use ""PARTY"", then:
   Position 1: P (new)
   Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, but we don't know about this position)
   Position 3: R (we know R is in the word, but we don't know about this position)
   Position 4: T (new)
   Position 5: Y (new)

 This seems like a good candidate because it tests R and A in new positions and introduces three new letters.

 However, note that we have two known letters (R and A) and three new ones. That might be efficient.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants. But let's go with ""PARTY"".

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? The feedback doesn't indicate that, but we don't know. However, since we are only required to have R and A, and we are including them once, it should be okay.

 Another option: ""ROAST"" -> but we know E is not in the word, so that's safe? Actually, ""ROAST"" has O, A, S, T and R. But note: we have R in position 1 and A in position 3? 
   However, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong? 
   Actually, we should avoid putting A in position 3 again because we already know it's not there. Similarly, we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 In ""ROAST"":
   R is in position 1 (which is new, so that's good)
   O is new
   A is in position 3 -> but we know A is not in position 3! So that would be a waste because we already know that. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

 So ""ROAST"" is not a good choice because it puts A in the same wrong position (3) again.

 Therefore, let's go with ""PARTY"".

 But wait: what about the letter R? In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and now in ""PARTY"" we are putting R in position 3. That's a new position, so it's okay.

 Alternatively, we could try ""TRAIL"" or ""BRAWL"", but we have to avoid the letters C, N, E.

 However, note: we don't know if the word has B, L, I, etc. But that's the point of guessing.

 Another idea: we might want to try a word that has the R in a position that we haven't tried and also the A in a new position, and also include other vowels? We already know the word has A, but we don't know about other vowels. The first guess had A and E, but E is not in the word. So the word has at least one vowel: A. But it might have others.

 Since we have only tried A and E (and E is out), we might want to try O, I, U.

 But in ""PARTY"", we are trying A again and also Y (which is sometimes a vowel). We are not trying O, I, U.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has more vowels? But we have two known consonants? Actually, we don't know if R is a consonant and A is a vowel.

 Let me think of a word that has R and A, and also O and I? But we have 5 letters.

 Example: ""RADIO"" -> but that has D and I and O. Also, A is in position 2? We don't know if that's allowed. But note: we are avoiding C, N, E.

 However, in ""RADIO"":
   R is in position 1 (new)
   A is in position 2 (new) -> we don't know if A can be in position 2? Yes, because we only know it's not in position 3.
   D is new
   I is new
   O is new

 This might be even better because we test three new vowels (I and O) and a new consonant (D). Also, we are testing R and A in new positions.

 But note: we are using R in position 1. We don't know if that's correct, but that's the point.

 However, we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any reason to think that yet.

 Let me compare:
   ""PARTY"": tests P, A, R, T, Y -> and we know A and R are present, so we are testing three new letters (P, T, Y) and confirming the positions of A and R.
   ""RADIO"": tests R, A, D, I, O -> and we know A and R are present, so we are testing three new letters (D, I, O).

 Both are valid. But ""RADIO"" tests more vowels, which might be useful.

 However, note that the feedback for the first word didn't have any correct positions. So the word might not start with R? But we don't know.

 I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests multiple vowels.

 But wait: what if the word has both I and O? We don't know. But we are trying to get as much information as possible.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RAINY"" or ""ROAST"" (but we already saw ROAST has A in position 3 which is bad).

 Another common word: ""ALERT"" -> but we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E. So ""ALERT"" is invalid because it has E.

 Similarly, ""STARE"" has E -> invalid.

 So let's go with ""RADIO"".

 But note: we must avoid putting A in position 3? In ""RADIO"", A is in position 2, which is new. So that's good.

 Also, R is in position 1, which is new.

 Therefore, I will guess ""RADIO"".

 However, let me double-check: 
   First guess: ""crane"" -> we know the secret word has R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
   ""RADIO"": 
        Position 1: R -> we don't know if R is in position 1? It might be, or it might be elsewhere.
        Position 2: A -> we don't know if A is in position 2? It might be, or it might be elsewhere.

 This guess will help us locate R and A.

 So, second guess: ""RADIO""

 But note: we are also testing D, I, O. If any of these are in the word, we'll get feedback.

 Let me write the feedback we expect if the secret word is, say, ""BRISK"" (from the example) but we know from first guess that ""BRISK"" has R and A? Actually, ""BRISK"" does not have A. So that example is not relevant.

 We don't know the secret word, but we know it has R and A.

 So, I think ""RADIO"" is a good guess.

 Alternatively, we could use ""TRAIN"" -> 
   T, R, A, I, N -> but wait, we know N is not in the word (from first guess: N was in position 4 and got x). So we cannot use N.

 Therefore, ""TRAIN"" is invalid.

 Similarly, ""PLAIN"" has N -> invalid.

 So, ""RADIO"" seems safe.

 Let me think of another word: ""ORBIT"" -> 
   O, R, B, I, T -> 
   R is in position 2? But in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we got a '-' meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong? 
   Actually, we should avoid putting R in position 2 because we already know it's not there.

 In ""ORBIT"", R is in position 2 -> that's the same as the first guess. So we would get a '-' again for R? But we already know that. So it's a waste of a position.

 Therefore, we want to avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3.

 In ""RADIO"", we are putting R in position 1 and A in position 2, which are both new positions. So that's good.

 Final decision: ""RADIO""

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include **R** and **A**, but avoid positions 2 for R and 3 for A.
- It should exclude **C, N, E** entirely.
- To maximize new information, I prioritized testing common vowels (**O, I**) and consonants (**D**) not yet tried, while placing R and A in new positions (R in position 1, A in position 2).

""RADIO"" fits these criteria:
- **R** is in position 1 (new position, not 2).
- **A** is in position 2 (new position, not 3).
- Introduces **D, I, O** (untested letters).
- Valid 5-letter word, excluding forbidden letters.

This guess will help locate R and A more precisely and reveal if D, I, or O are in the secret word.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,radar,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make a second guess.

 We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, N, E (because they are not in the secret word).
   - Contains R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

 Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

 We can also consider common letters to try to get more information.

 Since we know R and A are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions.

 Possibilities for R: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, A cannot be in position 3, so it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We might also want to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet, such as T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes some new common letters.

 Example: 
   We could try a word with R in the first position? But note: we don't know if R is in first or not. 
   However, we can try to put R in a different position than 2.

 One common word: ""PARTY"" -> but we have to check if it fits the constraints.
   P, A, R, T, Y.

 But note: in ""crane"", A was in position 3. Now in ""PARTY"", A is in position 2. That's allowed because the feedback only said A is in the word but not in position 3.

 However, we must avoid using C, N, E. ""PARTY"" doesn't have any of these.

 Let's check the positions:
   P in position 1: we don't know about P.
   A in position 2: we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 2? Actually, the feedback only said A is not in position 3. It could be in position 2.

 But wait: we also have R in position 3. In the first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong. Now we are putting R in position 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't know if position 3 is correct for R or not.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So position 3 might be correct.

 But let's see: if we use ""PARTY"", then:
   Position 1: P (new)
   Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, but we don't know about this position)
   Position 3: R (we know R is in the word, but we don't know about this position)
   Position 4: T (new)
   Position 5: Y (new)

 This seems like a good candidate because it tests R and A in new positions and introduces three new letters.

 However, note that we have two known letters (R and A) and three new ones. That might be efficient.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants. But let's go with ""PARTY"".

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? The feedback doesn't indicate that, but we don't know. However, since we are only required to have R and A, and we are including them once, it should be okay.

 Another option: ""ROAST"" -> but we know E is not in the word, so that's safe? Actually, ""ROAST"" has O, A, S, T and R. But note: we have R in position 1 and A in position 3? 
   However, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong? 
   Actually, we should avoid putting A in position 3 again because we already know it's not there. Similarly, we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 In ""ROAST"":
   R is in position 1 (which is new, so that's good)
   O is new
   A is in position 3 -> but we know A is not in position 3! So that would be a waste because we already know that. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

 So ""ROAST"" is not a good choice because it puts A in the same wrong position (3) again.

 Therefore, let's go with ""PARTY"".

 But wait: what about the letter R? In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and now in ""PARTY"" we are putting R in position 3. That's a new position, so it's okay.

 Alternatively, we could try ""TRAIL"" or ""BRAWL"", but we have to avoid the letters C, N, E.

 However, note: we don't know if the word has B, L, I, etc. But that's the point of guessing.

 Another idea: we might want to try a word that has the R in a position that we haven't tried and also the A in a new position, and also include other vowels? We already know the word has A, but we don't know about other vowels. The first guess had A and E, but E is not in the word. So the word has at least one vowel: A. But it might have others.

 Since we have only tried A and E (and E is out), we might want to try O, I, U.

 But in ""PARTY"", we are trying A again and also Y (which is sometimes a vowel). We are not trying O, I, U.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has more vowels? But we have two known consonants? Actually, we don't know if R is a consonant and A is a vowel.

 Let me think of a word that has R and A, and also O and I? But we have 5 letters.

 Example: ""RADIO"" -> but that has D and I and O. Also, A is in position 2? We don't know if that's allowed. But note: we are avoiding C, N, E.

 However, in ""RADIO"":
   R is in position 1 (new)
   A is in position 2 (new) -> we don't know if A can be in position 2? Yes, because we only know it's not in position 3.
   D is new
   I is new
   O is new

 This might be even better because we test three new vowels (I and O) and a new consonant (D). Also, we are testing R and A in new positions.

 But note: we are using R in position 1. We don't know if that's correct, but that's the point.

 However, we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any reason to think that yet.

 Let me compare:
   ""PARTY"": tests P, A, R, T, Y -> and we know A and R are present, so we are testing three new letters (P, T, Y) and confirming the positions of A and R.
   ""RADIO"": tests R, A, D, I, O -> and we know A and R are present, so we are testing three new letters (D, I, O).

 Both are valid. But ""RADIO"" tests more vowels, which might be useful.

 However, note that the feedback for the first word didn't have any correct positions. So the word might not start with R? But we don't know.

 I think ""RADIO"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests multiple vowels.

 But wait: what if the word has both I and O? We don't know. But we are trying to get as much information as possible.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RAINY"" or ""ROAST"" (but we already saw ROAST has A in position 3 which is bad).

 Another common word: ""ALERT"" -> but we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E. So ""ALERT"" is invalid because it has E.

 Similarly, ""STARE"" has E -> invalid.

 So let's go with ""RADIO"".

 But note: we must avoid putting A in position 3? In ""RADIO"", A is in position 2, which is new. So that's good.

 Also, R is in position 1, which is new.

 Therefore, I will guess ""RADIO"".

 However, let me double-check: 
   First guess: ""crane"" -> we know the secret word has R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
   ""RADIO"": 
        Position 1: R -> we don't know if R is in position 1? It might be, or it might be elsewhere.
        Position 2: A -> we don't know if A is in position 2? It might be, or it might be elsewhere.

 This guess will help us locate R and A.

 So, second guess: ""RADIO""

 But note: we are also testing D, I, O. If any of these are in the word, we'll get feedback.

 Let me write the feedback we expect if the secret word is, say, ""BRISK"" (from the example) but we know from first guess that ""BRISK"" has R and A? Actually, ""BRISK"" does not have A. So that example is not relevant.

 We don't know the secret word, but we know it has R and A.

 So, I think ""RADIO"" is a good guess.

 Alternatively, we could use ""TRAIN"" -> 
   T, R, A, I, N -> but wait, we know N is not in the word (from first guess: N was in position 4 and got x). So we cannot use N.

 Therefore, ""TRAIN"" is invalid.

 Similarly, ""PLAIN"" has N -> invalid.

 So, ""RADIO"" seems safe.

 Let me think of another word: ""ORBIT"" -> 
   O, R, B, I, T -> 
   R is in position 2? But in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we got a '-' meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong? 
   Actually, we should avoid putting R in position 2 because we already know it's not there.

 In ""ORBIT"", R is in position 2 -> that's the same as the first guess. So we would get a '-' again for R? But we already know that. So it's a waste of a position.

 Therefore, we want to avoid putting R in position 2 and A in position 3.

 In ""RADIO"", we are putting R in position 1 and A in position 2, which are both new positions. So that's good.

 Final decision: ""RADIO""

<guess>radio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include **R** and **A**, but avoid positions 2 for R and 3 for A.
- It should exclude **C, N, E** entirely.
- To maximize new information, I prioritized testing common vowels (**O, I**) and consonants (**D**) not yet tried, while placing R and A in new positions (R in position 1, A in position 2).

""RADIO"" fits these criteria:
- **R** is in position 1 (new position, not 2).
- **A** is in position 2 (new position, not 3).
- Introduces **D, I, O** (untested letters).
- Valid 5-letter word, excluding forbidden letters.

This guess will help locate R and A more precisely and reveal if D, I, or O are in the secret word.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""radio""
  R: ✓ (correct position) -> so R is at position 1
  A: ✓ (correct position) -> so A is at position 2
  D: ✓ (correct position) -> so D is at position 3
  I: x (not in word)
  O: x (not in word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word starts with ""R"", then ""A"", then ""D"". So the first three letters are ""R A D"".
- The letters I and O are not in the word.
- Additionally, from the first guess, we know that C, N, E are not in the word.

So the secret word is of the form: ""R A D _ _""

We need to find the last two letters. We know they are not C, N, E, I, O (and also not R, A, D because we already have them? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? However, we don't have any indication of duplicates so far. The feedback for ""radio"" showed that R, A, D are correct and in place, and I and O are absent. So if there were duplicates, we might have seen some feedback for the second occurrence? But in this case, we don't have any duplicate in the guess. So we assume no duplicates for now, but we must be cautious.

We also know from the first guess that in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and A in position 3, which were wrong positions. But now we know that R is actually in position 1 and A in position 2, so that explains why they were marked as present but wrong position in the first guess.

Now, for the last two letters, we need to find two letters that complete the word. We have to avoid the letters that we know are not in the word: C, E, I, N, O.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Common 5-letter words starting with ""RAD"": 
  radio (but we know O is not in the word, and we already guessed it)
  radii (but I is not in the word, and we have two I's? but I is not in the word at all)
  radon (but O and N are not in the word? N is not in the word from first guess, and O is not from second)
  radar (but that has two A's and two R's? but we already have R at position 1 and A at position 2, and then D at 3, then A at 4? but we don't know if A is duplicated. Also, R at the end? but we have R at position 1, and if there's another R at the end, that would be okay? But we don't have any feedback indicating duplicates. However, we must consider the possibility.)

But note: in the first guess, we had R in the word (at position 2) and now we have R at position 1. If the word had two R's, then in the first guess we would have one R in the correct position (if there was one at position 1) and one in the wrong? But in the first guess, we only had one R (in position 2) and it was marked as present but wrong position. Then in the second guess, we have R at position 1 and it is correct. So if there were a second R, we would have seen a '-' for the R in the first guess? Actually, no: in the first guess, we only had one R, so if the word has two R's, we would have only one R in the guess and it would be marked as present (if one of the R's in the word is not at position 2). But we don't have any indication of a second R. Similarly for A.

However, in the second guess, we have A at position 2 and it is correct. If there were a second A, we don't know because we didn't test any other position for A. Similarly for D.

But for now, let's assume no duplicates until we have evidence.

So we are looking for words that start with ""RAD"", and the last two letters are not C, E, I, N, O.

Let me list possible words:

- radix: but I is not in the word? and X might be? but we don't know. However, I is not allowed because we know I is not in the word (from second guess: I is x). So radix is invalid.

- radon: has O and N -> invalid.

- radar: has A at the end? and R at the end. But we don't know if A and R are duplicated. However, we must check if the letters are allowed. We know C, E, I, N, O are not in the word. So A and R are allowed if duplicated? But we don't have any information that they are duplicated. Also, in ""radar"", the last two letters are A and R. But we haven't tested A in position 4? and R in position 5? 

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now in ""radar"", we have A in position 4? That might be possible. Similarly, R in position 5? We had R in position 2 in the first guess and it was wrong, but now we have R in position 1 (correct) and if there is another R in position 5, that would be a duplicate.

But we don't have any feedback that rules out duplicates. So we cannot rule out ""radar"" yet.

However, we have only 6 tries, so we might want to avoid guessing a word with duplicates until we have more information? But we are at guess 3, so we can try to get more information about the last two letters.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that has the form ""R A D _ _"" and uses new letters to test.

We know the last two letters must be from the remaining alphabet excluding C, E, I, N, O.

The remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to choose two letters that are common and can form a word.

But note: we are constrained by the fact that the word must be a valid English word.

Common words starting with ""RAD"": 
  radius -> but has I and S? I is not allowed, so invalid.
  radon -> invalid (O and N)
  radix -> invalid (I)
  radon -> invalid
  radly -> not a common word? and has L and Y. But is it valid? ""radly"" is not a word. 
  radge -> not common? and has G and E? E is invalid.

Actually, the common words are limited.

We can consider:
  radar -> R A D A R -> but that has two A's and two R's. We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn't show duplicates? Actually, in Wordle, duplicates are handled by the feedback: if a letter is duplicated in the guess and the word has only one, then one might be marked and the other not. But in this case, we haven't seen that.

But we are at guess 3, and we have three letters already: R, A, D in the first three positions. We need to find the last two.

We can try to guess a word that has the first three as ""RAD"" and then two new letters that we haven't tested, to see if they are in the word.

But we have to avoid the letters we know are not in the word: C, E, I, N, O.

So let's try to form a word: ""RAD"" + two new letters.

For example: 
  ""RADAR"" -> but that uses A and R again. We don't get new information about other letters? We would be testing the same letters again. But we don't know if they are duplicated.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has different letters in the last two positions.

Possible words:
  ""RADIO"" we already tried -> not the word.
  ""RADON"" -> invalid because of O and N.
  ""RADII"" -> invalid because of I.

But there are other words: 
  ""RADIX"" -> invalid (I)
  ""RADON"" -> invalid
  ""RANDS"" -> but we know N is not in the word, so invalid.

Wait, what about:
  ""RADAR"" -> we have to consider it? But let's see if it's possible.

But we can also think of:
  ""RADDY"" -> not a common word? (meaning: a type of fish or slang? not standard)
  ""RADIF"" -> not a word.

Actually, the only common word that starts with ""RAD"" and doesn't contain the forbidden letters is ""RADAR"". 

But let me check: 
  ""RALLY"" -> but that doesn't start with ""RAD"", it starts with ""RAL"".

We need words starting with ""RAD"".

Another one: ""RADIO"" is the most common, but we already tried and it's not the word.

Then ""RADON"" is a chemical element, but has O and N -> invalid.

""RADIUM"" -> has U and M? and it's 6 letters? No, radium is 6 letters? R-A-D-I-U-M -> 6 letters. So not.

""RADAR"" is 5 letters: R-A-D-A-R.

So ""RADAR"" is a candidate.

But we have to check if it fits the feedback.

In ""RADAR"", the letters are: 
  Position 1: R -> we know is correct (from second guess)
  Position 2: A -> we know is correct
  Position 3: D -> we know is correct
  Position 4: A -> we don't know? But we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it can be duplicated? 
  Position 5: R -> we don't know? Similarly for R.

But in the first guess, we had only one R and it was in position 2 (wrong) and one A in position 3 (wrong). Now, if the word is ""RADAR"", then:
  In the first guess, the R in position 2: the word has R at position 1 and 5. So the R at position 2 in the guess is not matching, but there is another R? Actually, the feedback for the first guess would have shown two R's? But we only had one R in ""crane"". So the feedback for R was '-' meaning present but wrong position. That is consistent because there is an R at position 1 (which we didn't guess) and at position 5 (which we didn't guess). But we only provided one R, so it would only show one '-' for R.

Similarly, for A: in the first guess, we had A at position 3. In ""RADAR"", there is an A at position 2 and 4. So the A at position 3 in the guess is not present? Actually, no: the word has A at position 2 and 4, so the A at position 3 in the guess is not matching, but there is an A in the word. So it would be marked as present but wrong position. That matches the feedback.

In the second guess, we had ""RADIO"": 
  R at 1: correct (because the word has R at 1)
  A at 2: correct (because the word has A at 2)
  D at 3: correct (because the word has D at 3)
  I at 4: not in the word -> correct, because ""RADAR"" has A at 4, not I.
  O at 5: not in the word -> correct.

So ""RADAR"" is consistent with the feedback.

But is there any other word?

What about ""RADII""? But we know I is not in the word, so no.

""RADON""? has O and N -> no.

""RADIX""? has I -> no.

""RADAR"" is the only common word that fits.

But let me think: are there other words? 
  ""RADDY"" -> not a standard word? 
  ""RADGE"" -> not standard and has E? E is not allowed.

So I think ""RADAR"" is the word.

But we are at guess 3, and we can guess it.

Alternatively, we could try to get more information by guessing a word that has two new letters in the last two positions? But if we do that, we might not guess the word and use a try.

But if we are confident that ""RADAR"" is the only possibility, we can guess it.

However, let me double-check: is there any other word?

Another word: ""RADON"" is not allowed.

""RABAT""? -> but that is R A B A T? But we have D at position 3? In ""RABAT"", the third letter is B, not D. So that doesn't fit because we know the third letter is D.

We know the first three letters are R, A, D.

So the word must be ""RAD??"" and the last two letters must be from the allowed set.

Let me list all 5-letter words starting with ""RAD"" that don't contain C, E, I, N, O.

Using a word list, but since I don't have one, I'll think:

- radar: R A D A R -> uses A and R again. Allowed because we don't have evidence against duplicates? And the letters A and R are in the word, so duplicates are possible.

- raddi: but has I -> invalid.

- raddy: not a word? 

- radge: has E -> invalid.

- radgy: not a word.

- radif: not a word.

- radix: has I -> invalid.

- radon: has O and N -> invalid.

So indeed, ""RADAR"" seems to be the only common word.

Therefore, I will guess ""RADAR"".

But note: in the second guess, we got three correct (R, A, D) and two absent (I, O). So the secret word has exactly the letters R, A, D and possibly duplicates? Or other letters? But we know the first three are R, A, D, so the last two must be from the remaining letters that are in the word? Or they could be new letters that we haven't tested? But we have tested many letters: C, E, I, N, O are out. So the last two must be from the remaining alphabet.

But in ""RADAR"", the last two are A and R, which we already know are in the word. So that is consistent.

If there is a word like ""RADKY"" (which is not a word) or ""RADLY"" (not a word), then we would have to consider. But since they are not words, we don't.

So I think ""RADAR"" is the answer.

But to be safe, we can guess ""RADAR"" as the third guess.

If we are wrong, we get feedback and then we can adjust.

But given the above, I'll go with ""RADAR"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(not in word), R(in word, wrong position), A(in word, wrong position), N(not in word), E(not in word).  
  This revealed:  
  - R and A are in the secret word, but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.  
  - C, N, and E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""radio""**  
  Feedback: R(correct position), A(correct position), D(correct position), I(not in word), O(not in word).  
  This revealed:  
  - The first three letters of the secret word are **R**, **A**, and **D** (positions 1, 2, and 3).  
  - I and O are not in the word.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **RAD**, followed by two unknown letters.  
- Excluded letters: **C, E, I, N, O** (cannot appear anywhere in the word).  
- The remaining letters to test are: **B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  
- No duplicates have been indicated yet, but duplicates are possible (e.g., if the word has multiple R's or A's).  

### Analysis for Guess 3:
- The goal is to solve for the last two letters (positions 4 and 5).  
- Given the constraints, the only common English word fitting ""RAD _ _"" without excluded letters is **RADAR** (R-A-D-A-R).  
- Why ""RADAR""?  
  - It uses the confirmed starting letters ""RAD"".  
  - The last two letters (A and R) are already known to be in the word (from earlier feedback), so duplicates are possible.  
  - It avoids all excluded letters (C, E, I, N, O).  
  - If correct, this guess will solve the word. If incorrect, the feedback will reveal new information about the last two positions.  
- Alternatives like ""RADON"" (invalid due to O and N), ""RADII"" (invalid due to I), or ""RADIX"" (invalid due to I) are excluded.  

### Conclusion:
Given the above, ""RADAR"" is the strongest guess. It either solves the puzzle or provides critical feedback for positions 4 and 5.

<guess>radar</guess>",radar,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""radio""
  R: ✓ (correct position) -> so R is at position 1
  A: ✓ (correct position) -> so A is at position 2
  D: ✓ (correct position) -> so D is at position 3
  I: x (not in word)
  O: x (not in word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word starts with ""R"", then ""A"", then ""D"". So the first three letters are ""R A D"".
- The letters I and O are not in the word.
- Additionally, from the first guess, we know that C, N, E are not in the word.

So the secret word is of the form: ""R A D _ _""

We need to find the last two letters. We know they are not C, N, E, I, O (and also not R, A, D because we already have them? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? However, we don't have any indication of duplicates so far. The feedback for ""radio"" showed that R, A, D are correct and in place, and I and O are absent. So if there were duplicates, we might have seen some feedback for the second occurrence? But in this case, we don't have any duplicate in the guess. So we assume no duplicates for now, but we must be cautious.

We also know from the first guess that in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and A in position 3, which were wrong positions. But now we know that R is actually in position 1 and A in position 2, so that explains why they were marked as present but wrong position in the first guess.

Now, for the last two letters, we need to find two letters that complete the word. We have to avoid the letters that we know are not in the word: C, E, I, N, O.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Also, R at the end? but we have R at position 1, and if there's another R at the end, that would be okay? But we don't have any feedback indicating duplicates. However, we must consider the possibility.)

But note: in the first guess, we had R in the word (at position 2) and now we have R at position 1. If the word had two R's, then in the first guess we would have one R in the correct position (if there was one at position 1) and one in the wrong? But in the first guess, we only had one R (in position 2) and it was marked as present but wrong position. Then in the second guess, we have R at position 1 and it is correct. So if there were a second R, we would have seen a '-' for the R in the first guess? Actually, no: in the first guess, we only had one R, so if the word has two R's, we would have only one R in the guess and it would be marked as present (if one of the R's in the word is not at position 2). But we don't have any indication of a second R. Similarly for A.

However, in the second guess, we have A at position 2 and it is correct. If there were a second A, we don't know because we didn't test any other position for A. Similarly for D.

But for now, let's assume no duplicates until we have evidence.

So we are looking for words that start with ""RAD"", and the last two letters are not C, E, I, N, O.

Let me list possible words:

- radix: but I is not in the word? and X might be? but we don't know. However, I is not allowed because we know I is not in the word (from second guess: I is x). So radix is invalid.

- radon: has O and N -> invalid.

- radar: has A at the end? and R at the end. But we don't know if A and R are duplicated. However, we must check if the letters are allowed. We know C, E, I, N, O are not in the word. So A and R are allowed if duplicated? But we don't have any information that they are duplicated. Also, in ""radar"", the last two letters are A and R. But we haven't tested A in position 4? and R in position 5? 

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now in ""radar"", we have A in position 4? That might be possible. Similarly, R in position 5? We had R in position 2 in the first guess and it was wrong, but now we have R in position 1 (correct) and if there is another R in position 5, that would be a duplicate.

But we don't have any feedback that rules out duplicates. So we cannot rule out ""radar"" yet.

The remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to choose two letters that are common and can form a word.

But note: we are constrained by the fact that the word must be a valid English word.

Common words starting with ""RAD"": 
  radius -> but has I and S? I is not allowed, so invalid.
  radon -> invalid (O and N)
  radix -> invalid (I)
  radon -> invalid
  radly -> not a common word? and has L and Y. But is it valid? ""radly"" is not a word. 
  radge -> not common? and has G and E? E is invalid.

Actually, the common words are limited.

We can consider:
  radar -> R A D A R -> but that has two A's and two R's. We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn't show duplicates?

Wait, what about:

But we can also think of:
  ""RADDY"" -> not a common word? (meaning: a type of fish or slang? not standard)
  ""RADIF"" -> not a word.

Actually, the only common word that starts with ""RAD"" and doesn't contain the forbidden letters is ""RADAR"". 

But let me check: 
  ""RALLY"" -> but that doesn't start with ""RAD"", it starts with ""RAL"".

We need words starting with ""RAD"".

Another one: ""RADIO"" is the most common, but we already tried and it's not the word.

Then ""RADON"" is a chemical element, but has O and N -> invalid.

""RADIUM"" -> has U and M? and it's 6 letters? No, radium is 6 letters? R-A-D-I-U-M -> 6 letters. So not.

""RADAR"" is 5 letters: R-A-D-A-R.

So ""RADAR"" is a candidate.

But we have to check if it fits the feedback.

In ""RADAR"", the letters are: 
  Position 1: R -> we know is correct (from second guess)
  Position 2: A -> we know is correct
  Position 3: D -> we know is correct
  Position 4: A -> we don't know? But we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it can be duplicated? 
  Position 5: R -> we don't know? Similarly for R.

But in the first guess, we had only one R and it was in position 2 (wrong) and one A in position 3 (wrong). Now, if the word is ""RADAR"", then:

Similarly, for A: in the first guess, we had A at position 3. In ""RADAR"", there is an A at position 2 and 4. So the A at position 3 in the guess is not present? Actually, no: the word has A at position 2 and 4, so the A at position 3 in the guess is not matching, but there is an A in the word. So it would be marked as present but wrong position. That matches the feedback.

In the second guess, we had ""RADIO"": 
  R at 1: correct (because the word has R at 1)
  A at 2: correct (because the word has A at 2)
  D at 3: correct (because the word has D at 3)
  I at 4: not in the word -> correct, because ""RADAR"" has A at 4, not I.
  O at 5: not in the word -> correct.

So ""RADAR"" is consistent with the feedback.

But is there any other word?

What about ""RADII""? But we know I is not in the word, so no.

""RADON""? has O and N -> no.

""RADIX""? has I -> no.

""RADAR"" is the only common word that fits.

  - If correct, this guess will solve the word. If incorrect, the feedback will reveal new information about the last two positions.  
- Alternatives like ""RADON"" (invalid due to O and N), ""RADII"" (invalid due to I), or ""RADIX"" (invalid due to I) are excluded.  

### Conclusion:
Given the above, ""RADAR"" is the strongest guess. It either solves the puzzle or provides critical feedback for positions 4 and 5.",Guess 3: radar -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) D(✓) A(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
