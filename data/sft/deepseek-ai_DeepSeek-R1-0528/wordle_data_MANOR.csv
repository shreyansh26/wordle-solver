We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, the secret word contains R, A, and N, but not C or E.
 Also, R, A, and N are not in the positions they were in ""crane"".

 The positions in ""crane"" are:
  1: C (wrong letter)
  2: R (in word but not here)
  3: A (in word but not here)
  4: N (in word but not here)
  5: E (wrong letter)

 Since R, A, and N are in the word but not at positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively, they must be elsewhere.

 We know the word is 5 letters and must include R, A, N and exclude C and E.

 Also, note that the word cannot have C or E.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that uses R, A, N and avoids C and E.

 We also want to try to place new letters to get more information, but we must include the known letters (R, A, N) but in different positions.

 Since R cannot be at position 2, and similarly A not at 3, N not at 4, we can try placing them in other positions.

 We have positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 available.

 Possibilities for R: can be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: our feedback says R is in the word but not at position 2. Similarly for A and N.

 We must try a word that has:
   - R not at position 2
   - A not at position 3
   - N not at position 4

 And we must include R, A, N (and two more letters that are not C or E).

 We also want to try two new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common words that have R, A, N and two other consonants or vowels? Since we cannot use E, we might use other vowels like I, O, U? Or consonants.

 The word might have another vowel? Because we have A, but maybe more vowels? Or it could have other consonants.

 Since we know the word has at least three letters: R, A, N.

 Let me try to form a word that has R, A, N in positions different from 2,3,4.

 Example positions: 
   R could go in position 1? Or position 3? 
   But note: in the first guess, position 3 was A, so R could be at 1? 
   Also A cannot be at position 3, so A could be at 1,2,4,5? But wait: position 4 was N, which is also not allowed for A? Actually, no: the restriction for A is only that it cannot be at position 3. Similarly, N cannot be at 4.

 So, possible positions for letters:
   Position 1: can be R? or A? or N? or a new letter?
   Position 2: cannot be R? Actually, we know R cannot be at position 2? But we can put A or N or a new letter at position 2? Yes.

 However, note: position 2: we had R and got a '-' meaning R is in the word but not here. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? But we are going to form a new word anyway.

 We are going to make a new guess, so we can try:

 Option: place R at position 1? Then A must not be at position 3, so we can put A at position 4? Then N must not be at position 4? But if we put A at 4, then N cannot be at 4? We can put N at position 2? Or position 5?

 But note: we also need two more letters.

 Let me try to think of words containing R, A, N.

 Also, remember we have two positions to fill with new letters.

 Since E and C are out, we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? (but no E,C)

 Common words: 
   ""RAN"" is three letters, so we need five letters.

 Words: 
   ""GRAND"" -> G, R, A, N, D. But let's check positions:
      Position 1: G (new)
      Position 2: R (but we know R cannot be at position 2? Actually, we don't know that the secret word doesn't have R at position 2? Wait, no: we got '-' for R at position 2 meaning that it is in the word but not in that position. So in the secret word, R is not at position 2? Therefore, if we put R at position 2 again, it would be wrong? But the feedback told us that R is not at position 2. So we should avoid putting R at position 2 in our next guess? Actually, no: we can put R at any position in the next guess, because we are just testing. But why risk? We already know that in the secret word, R is not at position 2. So we can avoid it to get a correct feedback.

 However, note: by avoiding R at position 2, we can get a '-' or '✓' in a different position. But if we put R at position 2 again, we might get '-' again? But wait: if R is not at position 2 in the secret word, then putting R at position 2 again would give us '-' because the letter R is present but not in position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong position will be '-' regardless of where we put it? But if we put it in the same wrong position again, we get '-' again? And we haven't learned anything new? So better to put R in a position we haven't tried.

 Similarly, avoid A in position 3 and N in position 4.

 So let's avoid:

   Position 2: R
   Position 3: A
   Position 4: N

 Therefore, for our next guess, we want:

   R in {1,3,4,5} but we have to pick one? Actually, we can pick any except 2? Yes.

   But note: we also want to try new positions for R? Because we only know it's not at 2.

   Similarly, A should be in {1,2,4,5} (not 3)
   N should be in {1,2,3,5} (not 4)

 Now, let's form a word.

 We also want to use two new letters to get more information.

 Idea: try R at position 1? Then what? 

   Position 1: R
   Then A: cannot be at 3? So we can try A at position 2? But position 2: can we put A? Yes, because we haven't tried A at position 2? We only know A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, we can put N at position 3? But then we must avoid placing N at position 4? And at position 3 is okay? Yes, because N can be at 3? But then we would need two more letters at positions 4 and 5.

   So: R at 1, A at 2? and then N at 3? Then we have R A N at positions 1,2,3. But then we have two letters left? And we have to avoid C and E? So positions 4 and 5: two new letters.

   Example: ""RANCH"" -> but H is new? But wait, we cannot use C? Because we know C is not in the word? So avoid C? 

   We need words without C and E.

   Alternative: ""RANDY"" -> R, A, N, D, Y -> D and Y are new? Let me check: ""RANDY"" is a word? Yes.

   But check positions: 
      Pos1: R -> is R allowed? We are trying R at 1? 
      Pos2: A -> but we know A is in the word but not at position 3? But we haven't tested position 2? Actually, we don't know if A is at position 2? It might be? So this is valid.
      Pos3: N -> we know N is not at position 4? But we are putting N at position 3? That's okay? Yes.

   Then positions 4 and 5: D and Y? But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not at position 4? So if we put N at position 3, that's okay? Yes.

   Similarly, R at 1: we don't know if that's the correct position? We'll find out.

   Alternatively, we might try using a word that places the known letters in completely new positions? For example, put R at position 4? A at position 1? Etc.

   However, let's consider: we also want to test new letters? In ""RANDY"", we introduce D and Y? That might be good? 

   But what if the secret word has a double letter? Not necessarily? We don't know.

   Another word: ""TRAIN"" -> T, R, A, I, N. This has T and I? And avoids C and E? But let's check positions:

      Position 1: T (new)
      Position 2: R -> we know R not at position 2? Trying R again at position 2 might give '-'? But why waste? Because we know it's not there? So better avoid? So skip.

   Alternatively, ""ADORN"" -> A, D, O, R, N -> 

      Positions:
        A at position 1? (A can be at position 1? because we don't know yet? Actually, we only know A is not at 3? So putting at 1 is okay)
        D at position 2? (new)
        O at position 3? (new) -> but note: position 3: originally A? Now we put O? okay.
        R at position 4? (so not at 2? we know R not at 2? So putting at 4 is fine? Yes)
        N at position 5? (because we cannot put at position 4? and putting at 5 is okay)

   And positions: 
        A at position 1: we haven't tried before -> good?
        R at position 4: new position -> good.
        N at position 5: new position -> good.

   Also introducing D and O? So two new letters? That's good? 

   So ""ADORN"" might be a good candidate.

   But consider: what if the secret word has two R's? We don't know? But we have only been told one R? Similarly for A and N? But wait: in the first guess, we had one of each? So if there were duplicates, the feedback might show more? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed? So if we guess one R and there are two R's, but both are wrong position? Or one is correct and one isn't?

   However, we only guessed one R? So we don't know? But in our next guess, we should not duplicate letters? Because we don't have information? Or we can? But if we duplicate, then we might get multiple feedbacks? And we don't know? We have no reason to duplicate? So let's avoid?

   Therefore, let's choose a word with distinct letters? 

   Check: ""ADORN"": A, D, O, R, N -> all distinct? Yes? (A, D, O, R, N -> 5 distinct letters)

   Also, we know the secret word has R, A, N? So ""ADORN"" is okay? 

   But also, we don't know other letters? So let me do ""ADORN""

   Alternatively, we might use ""ORGAN"" -> O, R, G, A, N -> distinct? 

      Positions: 
        O at position 1 (new)
        R at position 2 -> but we know R cannot be at position 2? So we avoid? Because it will give '-' and we know that already? So we want to avoid positions we know are wrong? For R: position 2 is known wrong? So if we put R at 2 we get minus? But that doesn't tell us anything? So skip. 

   Therefore, avoid putting known letters in positions we already know are wrong? So in ""ORGAN"", R is at position 2? which we know is wrong? So we don't want that? So better to choose a word that puts R at a new position? Like in ""ADORN"" we put R at 4? Good.

   Similarly, we put A at position 1? which we haven't tested? and N at position 5? which we haven't tested? 

   So ""ADORN"" seems a good candidate?

   Other words? ""RANIS""? No? Not a word? 

   ""DAIRY"" -> does not have R, A, N? but only R? Wait: we must include R, A, N? 

   Why must we include? Because we know they are there? So we should use them? Otherwise we might lose a chance to get a correct position? 

   Rule: we are allowed to guess words without R, A, N? But then we might waste? For example, if we guess a word without R, A, N, then we get all feedback of 'x'? And we lose the chance to check the positions? So we should use R, A, N? 

   Therefore, ""ADORN"" is a good choice? 

   Let me double-check: 

   Letters: A, D, O, R, N -> contains A, R, N? Yes.

   Positions: 
      Position 1: A -> not position 3? okay? 
      Position 2: D -> new
      Position 3: O -> new
      Position 4: R -> not position 2? okay? 
      Position 5: N -> not position 4? okay? 

   So we are testing A at position 1, R at position 4, and N at position 5? Also testing D and O? 

   If we get feedback, we might get more clues.

   Alternatively, we can try ""BARNY""? B, A, R, N, Y? But B and Y? But positions: 
      Position1: B -> new
      Position2: A -> can we put A at position2? yes? 
      Position3: R? -> but wait, R? We put R at position3? but originally R was at position2? we are shifting? 
      Position4: N? -> but we know N is not at position4? So we cannot put N at position4? Oh wait: feedback told us N is not at position4? So we must not put N at position4? But in ""BARNY"", N is at position4? That would be a mistake? Because we know it's not there? That would cause a '-'? So we avoid? 

   Therefore, ""BARNY"" has N at position4? which is known wrong? So skip.

   Another idea: ""ANGRY"" -> A, N, G, R, Y? 
      Position1: A? (so A not at position3? okay)
      Position2: N? -> we haven't tried? but we know N is not at position4? but position2 is new? okay? 
      Position3: G? new? 
      Position4: R? -> we know R is not at position2? Put at position4? okay? 
      Position5: Y? 

   But note: we have two Ns? Wait: no? ""ANGRY"" has one A, one N, one G, one R, one Y? 
      Positions: 
        A at position1? okay?
        N at position2? but we don't know if N can be at2? okay? 
        R at position4? okay? 

   Also, avoids known bad positions? 

   Therefore, ""ANGRY"" is also a candidate? 

   Now, between ""ADORN"" and ""ANGRY"", which one? Both are valid? 

   But in ""ANGRY"", we put A at position1 and N at position2? which we didn't test before? 
   And R at position4? 
   Also G and Y? 

   But note: we have already tried position2: in the first guess, position2 was R? Now we're putting N? That's a different letter? And we don't know? 

   Similarly, in ""ADORN"", we put D at position2? Now position2 is a different letter? 

   Both seem fine? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""RAINY"" -> 
      Position1: R (which we know? but new position? position1) -> okay? 
      Position2: A -> but wait: we know R cannot be at2? But A? Is A allowed at2? Yes? 
      Position3: I? -> new? 
      Position4: N? -> but we know N not at4? So we cannot? Skip! 

   So ""RAINY"" has N at position4? We must avoid position4 for N? So skip.

   Let me pick ""ADORN"" then? Or ""ANGRY""? 

   We might also consider ""TARNS"": T, A, R, N, S? 
      Positions: 
        1: T new? 
        2: A -> okay? 
        3: R? -> okay? 
        4: N? -> bad? We must avoid for N? So skip.

   Therefore, words that avoid placing A at3, R at2, N at4? 

   We can try ""GAUNT"": G, A, U, N, T? 
      Position1: G -> new?
      Position2: A -> okay? 
      Position3: U -> new?
      Position4: N -> bad? skip.

   So ""GAUNT"" fails? 

   Let me pick ""ADORN"" or ""ANGRY""? 

   Another word: ""DRAIN"": D, R, A, I, N? 
      Position1: D? new?
      Position2: R? -> bad? because we know R not at2? So skip? 

   So avoid words with R at position2? 

   Also, avoid words with A at3? and with N at4? 

   Therefore, ""ANGRY"" seems safe: 
      Position1: A? okay? 
      Position2: N? okay (because not position4? and we haven't tried at2? it's new) 
      Position3: G? new? 
      Position4: R? okay? (because not position2? and we haven't tried at4) 
      Position5: Y? 

   Similarly, ""ADORN"" is safe: 
      Position1: A? 
      Position2: D? 
      Position3: O? 
      Position4: R? 
      position5: N? 

   Both are valid? 

   But note: the secret word might have A at position1? Or not? We don't know? 

   We are going to get feedback? 

   It's arbitrary? Let me pick ""ANGRY"" because it uses common letters? 

   Or ""ADORN""?

   Maybe ""ADORN"" is less common? 

   Another idea: the feedback told us that the word does not have C or E? So maybe the vowels? The secret word might have O? or U? We don't know? 

   We can use both? 

   I'll pick ""ADORN""

   But why not ""RANKS""? 
      R at position1? 
      A at position2? 
      N at position3? 
      K at position4? 
      S at position5? 
      This avoids: R at2? not using position2 for R? R at1 -> good? 
      A not at3? here at2? okay? 
      N at3? We know it wasn't at4? Okay? 
      Also K and S? 

      But note: we have already tried position3? In the first guess, position3 had A? Now we put N? So that's a change? 

   But wait: does ""RANKS"" have R, A, N? yes? 

   Also no E or C? 

   And positions: 
      1: R? okay? 
      2: A? okay? 
      3: N? okay? 
      4: K? new? 
      5: S? new? 

   But we know that N is not at position4? Here we put N at position3? okay? 

   So ""RANKS"" is valid? 

   We have many choices? 

   So let me pick one? 

   Given the time, I'll choose ""ADORN"" because I thought of it first? 

   Or let me choose ""RANKS""? 

   Actually, let me think about commonality? ""RANKS"" might be more common? 

   But we don't know? 

   We can also consider: the first guess had R at position2? and we got '-', meaning R is somewhere else? So if we put R at position1? then we might get a '✓'? Or a '-'? 

   Similarly, we might get positions for A and N? 

   We'll learn? 

   I'll go with ""RANKS"": 
      R at position1? 
      A at position2? 
      N at position3? 
      K at position4? 
      S at position5? 

   But the feedback told us N is not at position4? But we are putting N at position3? which is fine? 

   Also, note: we haven't tested positions 1 and 5? Only 2,3,4? 

   Wait: our first guess tested positions 1 to 5? 
        Position1: C -> x? So C not present? 
        Position2: R -> -? so R present but wrong position? 
        Position3: A -> -? A present but wrong position? 
        Position4: N -> -? N present but wrong position? 
        Position5: E -> x? 

   So we haven't got any information about whether a letter is at position1? So testing R at position1? is a new position? 

   Similarly, position5? 

   Therefore, we should test new positions? 

   Which of the words uses new positions? Both ""ADORN"" and ""RANKS"" and ""ANGRY"" use different positions? 

   Specifically, ""RANKS"" tests positions: 
        R at1 (new)
        A at2 (we know position2 is R? but we are putting A? so if A is at2 then it's incorrect? but we don't know? Actually, the secret word doesn't have R at2? But we don't know about A at2? So we are testing it? 
        N at3 (originally A? same position? but different letter? we'll get new feedback? 
        K at4 (originally N? which we know is wrong? so if K is there is new? 
        S at5 (new) 

   Actually, we know position4: we got N at4? and it was wrong? So in the secret word, whatever letter at position4? and we put K? So if the secret word has K at position4? we get '✓'? If K is in the word but elsewhere? we get '-'? else 'x'? 

   Similarly, position3: originally A? we got '-'? meaning A is in the word but not here? So position3 must be another letter? Now we put N? So if N is at3? then it might be correct? 

   Therefore, ""RANKS"" seems okay? 

   However, let me compare to ""ADORN"": 
        Position1: A? originally C? which was wrong? now A? if correct? 
        Position2: D? new? 
        Position3: O? originally A? 
        Position4: R? originally N? 
        Position5: N? originally E? 

   So both test new placements? 

   I think both are valid? 

   I'll pick ""ADORN"" because I want to avoid the known bad positions? 

   Actually, I change my mind: let me choose ""RANKS"" because it uses two common consonants? 

   But I'll stick to ""ADORN""? 

   Let me flip a coin? 

   I'll choose ""ADORN""

   So guessed word: adorn

   Format: <guess>adorn</guess>

   But wait: ""ADORN"" is spelled A-D-O-R-N? So letters: A, D, O, R, N? 

   And positions: A at1, D at2, O at3, R at4, N at5? 

   So written as: ""adorn""

   Let me write: 
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know:
- C and E are not in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").
- R, A, and N are in the word but in incorrect positions: R is not at position 2, A is not at position 3, and N is not at position 4.

For the second guess, we need a word that includes R, A, and N (since they are confirmed present), avoids C and E, and places R, A, and N in new positions to test potential correct placements. The word ""adorn"" (A-D-O-R-N) meets these criteria:
- Uses letters A, D, O, R, N (includes R, A, N).
- Avoids C and E.
- Places A at position 1 (new position, wasn't tested before).
- Places R at position 4 (avoiding position 2 where we know it's incorrect).
- Places N at position 5 (avoiding position 4 where we know it's incorrect).
- Introduces two new letters (D and O) for further testing.

This guess maximizes information by testing new positions for known letters and bringing in additional letters not previously guessed.

<guess>adorn</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **E** are excluded (both marked ""x"").
- **R**, **A**, and **N** are present (marked ""-"") but misplaced:
  - R cannot be at position 2.
  - A cannot be at position 3.
  - N cannot be at position 4.

For the next guess, we need a word that:
1. Includes **R, A, N**.
2. Excludes **C** and **E**.
3. Tests new positions for **R, A, N** (avoiding positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively).
4. Introduces new letters to gather additional information.

**Why ""adorn""?**
- Letters: **A**, **D**, **O**, **R**, **N** (includes R, A, N; excludes C and E).
- Positions:
  - **A** at position 1 (new position, previously untested for A).
  - **D** (new letter) at position 2.
  - **O** (new letter) at position 3.
  - **R** at position 4 (avoids incorrect position 2).
  - **N** at position 5 (avoids incorrect position 4).
- This setup tests all known letters in new locations and introduces **D** and **O** to probe for additional letters in the secret word.

This guess efficiently leverages previous feedback to refine our search while maximizing new information from letter placements.

<guess>adorn</guess>",adorn,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, the secret word contains R, A, and N, but not C or E.
 Also, R, A, and N are not in the positions they were in ""crane"".

 The positions in ""crane"" are:
  1: C (wrong letter)
  2: R (in word but not here)
  3: A (in word but not here)
  4: N (in word but not here)
  5: E (wrong letter)

 Since R, A, and N are in the word but not at positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively, they must be elsewhere.

 We know the word is 5 letters and must include R, A, N and exclude C and E.

 Also, note that the word cannot have C or E.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that uses R, A, N and avoids C and E.

 We also want to try to place new letters to get more information, but we must include the known letters (R, A, N) but in different positions.

 Since R cannot be at position 2, and similarly A not at 3, N not at 4, we can try placing them in other positions.

 We have positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 available.

 Possibilities for R: can be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: our feedback says R is in the word but not at position 2. Similarly for A and N.

 We must try a word that has:
   - R not at position 2
   - A not at position 3
   - N not at position 4

 And we must include R, A, N (and two more letters that are not C or E).

 We also want to try two new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common words that have R, A, N and two other consonants or vowels? Since we cannot use E, we might use other vowels like I, O, U? Or consonants.

 The word might have another vowel? Because we have A, but maybe more vowels? Or it could have other consonants.

 Since we know the word has at least three letters: R, A, N.

 Let me try to form a word that has R, A, N in positions different from 2,3,4.

 Example positions: 
   R could go in position 1? Or position 3? 
   But note: in the first guess, position 3 was A, so R could be at 1? 
   Also A cannot be at position 3, so A could be at 1,2,4,5? But wait: position 4 was N, which is also not allowed for A? Actually, no: the restriction for A is only that it cannot be at position 3. Similarly, N cannot be at 4.

 So, possible positions for letters:
   Position 1: can be R? or A? or N? or a new letter?
   Position 2: cannot be R? Actually, we know R cannot be at position 2? But we can put A or N or a new letter at position 2? Yes.

 However, note: position 2: we had R and got a '-' meaning R is in the word but not here. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? But we are going to form a new word anyway.

 We are going to make a new guess, so we can try:

 Option: place R at position 1? Then A must not be at position 3, so we can put A at position 4? Then N must not be at position 4? But if we put A at 4, then N cannot be at 4? We can put N at position 2? Or position 5?

 But note: we also need two more letters.

 Let me try to think of words containing R, A, N.

 Also, remember we have two positions to fill with new letters.

 Since E and C are out, we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? (but no E,C)

 Common words: 
   ""RAN"" is three letters, so we need five letters.

 Words: 
   ""GRAND"" -> G, R, A, N, D. But let's check positions:
      Position 1: G (new)
      Position 2: R (but we know R cannot be at position 2? Actually, we don't know that the secret word doesn't have R at position 2? Wait, no: we got '-' for R at position 2 meaning that it is in the word but not in that position. So in the secret word, R is not at position 2? Therefore, if we put R at position 2 again, it would be wrong? But the feedback told us that R is not at position 2. So we should avoid putting R at position 2 in our next guess? Actually, no: we can put R at any position in the next guess, because we are just testing. But why risk? We already know that in the secret word, R is not at position 2. So we can avoid it to get a correct feedback.

 However, note: by avoiding R at position 2, we can get a '-' or '✓' in a different position. But if we put R at position 2 again, we might get '-' again? But wait: if R is not at position 2 in the secret word, then putting R at position 2 again would give us '-' because the letter R is present but not in position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong position will be '-' regardless of where we put it? But if we put it in the same wrong position again, we get '-' again? And we haven't learned anything new? So better to put R in a position we haven't tried.

 Similarly, avoid A in position 3 and N in position 4.

 So let's avoid:

   Position 2: R
   Position 3: A
   Position 4: N

 Therefore, for our next guess, we want:

   R in {1,3,4,5} but we have to pick one? Actually, we can pick any except 2? Yes.

   But note: we also want to try new positions for R? Because we only know it's not at 2.

   Similarly, A should be in {1,2,4,5} (not 3)
   N should be in {1,2,3,5} (not 4)

 Now, let's form a word.

 We also want to use two new letters to get more information.

 Idea: try R at position 1? Then what? 

   Position 1: R
   Then A: cannot be at 3? So we can try A at position 2? But position 2: can we put A? Yes, because we haven't tried A at position 2? We only know A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, we can put N at position 3? But then we must avoid placing N at position 4? And at position 3 is okay? Yes, because N can be at 3? But then we would need two more letters at positions 4 and 5.

   So: R at 1, A at 2? and then N at 3? Then we have R A N at positions 1,2,3. But then we have two letters left? And we have to avoid C and E? So positions 4 and 5: two new letters.

   Example: ""RANCH"" -> but H is new? But wait, we cannot use C? Because we know C is not in the word? So avoid C? 

   We need words without C and E.

   Alternative: ""RANDY"" -> R, A, N, D, Y -> D and Y are new? Let me check: ""RANDY"" is a word? Yes.

   But check positions: 
      Pos1: R -> is R allowed? We are trying R at 1? 
      Pos2: A -> but we know A is in the word but not at position 3? But we haven't tested position 2? Actually, we don't know if A is at position 2? It might be? So this is valid.
      Pos3: N -> we know N is not at position 4? But we are putting N at position 3? That's okay? Yes.

   Then positions 4 and 5: D and Y? But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not at position 4? So if we put N at position 3, that's okay? Yes.

   Similarly, R at 1: we don't know if that's the correct position? We'll find out.

   Alternatively, we might try using a word that places the known letters in completely new positions? For example, put R at position 4? A at position 1? Etc.

   However, let's consider: we also want to test new letters? In ""RANDY"", we introduce D and Y? That might be good? 

   But what if the secret word has a double letter? Not necessarily? We don't know.

   Another word: ""TRAIN"" -> T, R, A, I, N. This has T and I? And avoids C and E? But let's check positions:

      Position 1: T (new)
      Position 2: R -> we know R not at position 2? Trying R again at position 2 might give '-'? But why waste? Because we know it's not there? So better avoid? So skip.

   Alternatively, ""ADORN"" -> A, D, O, R, N -> 

      Positions:
        A at position 1? (A can be at position 1? because we don't know yet? Actually, we only know A is not at 3? So putting at 1 is okay)
        D at position 2? (new)
        O at position 3? (new) -> but note: position 3: originally A? Now we put O? okay.
        R at position 4? (so not at 2? we know R not at 2? So putting at 4 is fine? Yes)
        N at position 5? (because we cannot put at position 4? and putting at 5 is okay)

   And positions: 
        A at position 1: we haven't tried before -> good?
        R at position 4: new position -> good.
        N at position 5: new position -> good.

   Also introducing D and O? So two new letters? That's good? 

   So ""ADORN"" might be a good candidate.

   But consider: what if the secret word has two R's? We don't know? But we have only been told one R? Similarly for A and N? But wait: in the first guess, we had one of each? So if there were duplicates, the feedback might show more? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed? So if we guess one R and there are two R's, but both are wrong position? Or one is correct and one isn't?

   However, we only guessed one R? So we don't know? But in our next guess, we should not duplicate letters? Because we don't have information? Or we can? But if we duplicate, then we might get multiple feedbacks? And we don't know? We have no reason to duplicate? So let's avoid?

   Therefore, let's choose a word with distinct letters? 

   Check: ""ADORN"": A, D, O, R, N -> all distinct? Yes? (A, D, O, R, N -> 5 distinct letters)

   Also, we know the secret word has R, A, N? So ""ADORN"" is okay? 

   But also, we don't know other letters? So let me do ""ADORN""

   Alternatively, we might use ""ORGAN"" -> O, R, G, A, N -> distinct? 

      Positions: 
        O at position 1 (new)
        R at position 2 -> but we know R cannot be at position 2? So we avoid? Because it will give '-' and we know that already? So we want to avoid positions we know are wrong? For R: position 2 is known wrong? So if we put R at 2 we get minus? But that doesn't tell us anything? So skip. 

   Therefore, avoid putting known letters in positions we already know are wrong? So in ""ORGAN"", R is at position 2? which we know is wrong? So we don't want that? So better to choose a word that puts R at a new position? Like in ""ADORN"" we put R at 4? Good.

   Similarly, we put A at position 1? which we haven't tested? and N at position 5? which we haven't tested? 

   So ""ADORN"" seems a good candidate?

   Other words? ""RANIS""? No? Not a word? 

   ""DAIRY"" -> does not have R, A, N? but only R? Wait: we must include R, A, N? 

   Why must we include? Because we know they are there? So we should use them? Otherwise we might lose a chance to get a correct position? 

   Rule: we are allowed to guess words without R, A, N? But then we might waste? For example, if we guess a word without R, A, N, then we get all feedback of 'x'? And we lose the chance to check the positions? So we should use R, A, N? 

   Therefore, ""ADORN"" is a good choice? 

   Let me double-check: 

   Letters: A, D, O, R, N -> contains A, R, N? Yes.

   Positions: 
      Position 1: A -> not position 3? okay? 
      Position 2: D -> new
      Position 3: O -> new
      Position 4: R -> not position 2? okay? 
      Position 5: N -> not position 4? okay? 

   So we are testing A at position 1, R at position 4, and N at position 5? Also testing D and O? 

   If we get feedback, we might get more clues.

   Alternatively, we can try ""BARNY""? B, A, R, N, Y? But B and Y? But positions: 
      Position1: B -> new
      Position2: A -> can we put A at position2? yes? 
      Position3: R? -> but wait, R? We put R at position3? but originally R was at position2? we are shifting? 
      Position4: N? -> but we know N is not at position4? So we cannot put N at position4? Oh wait: feedback told us N is not at position4? So we must not put N at position4? But in ""BARNY"", N is at position4? That would be a mistake? Because we know it's not there? That would cause a '-'? So we avoid? 

   Therefore, ""BARNY"" has N at position4? which is known wrong? So skip.

   Another idea: ""ANGRY"" -> A, N, G, R, Y? 
      Position1: A? (so A not at position3? okay)
      Position2: N? -> we haven't tried? but we know N is not at position4? but position2 is new? okay? 
      Position3: G? new? 
      Position4: R? -> we know R is not at position2? Put at position4? okay? 
      Position5: Y? 

   But note: we have two Ns? Wait: no? ""ANGRY"" has one A, one N, one G, one R, one Y? 
      Positions: 
        A at position1? okay?
        N at position2? but we don't know if N can be at2? okay? 
        R at position4? okay? 

   Also, avoids known bad positions? 

   Therefore, ""ANGRY"" is also a candidate? 

   Now, between ""ADORN"" and ""ANGRY"", which one? Both are valid? 

   But in ""ANGRY"", we put A at position1 and N at position2? which we didn't test before? 
   And R at position4? 
   Also G and Y? 

   But note: we have already tried position2: in the first guess, position2 was R? Now we're putting N? That's a different letter? And we don't know? 

   Similarly, in ""ADORN"", we put D at position2? Now position2 is a different letter? 

   Both seem fine? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""RAINY"" -> 
      Position1: R (which we know? but new position? position1) -> okay? 
      Position2: A -> but wait: we know R cannot be at2? But A? Is A allowed at2? Yes? 
      Position3: I? -> new? 
      Position4: N? -> but we know N not at4? So we cannot? Skip! 

   So ""RAINY"" has N at position4? We must avoid position4 for N? So skip.

   Let me pick ""ADORN"" then? Or ""ANGRY""? 

   We might also consider ""TARNS"": T, A, R, N, S? 
      Positions: 
        1: T new? 
        2: A -> okay? 
        3: R? -> okay? 
        4: N? -> bad? We must avoid for N? So skip.

   Therefore, words that avoid placing A at3, R at2, N at4? 

   We can try ""GAUNT"": G, A, U, N, T? 
      Position1: G -> new?
      Position2: A -> okay? 
      Position3: U -> new?
      Position4: N -> bad? skip.

   So ""GAUNT"" fails? 

   Let me pick ""ADORN"" or ""ANGRY""? 

   Another word: ""DRAIN"": D, R, A, I, N? 
      Position1: D? new?
      Position2: R? -> bad? because we know R not at2? So skip? 

   So avoid words with R at position2? 

   Also, avoid words with A at3? and with N at4? 

   Therefore, ""ANGRY"" seems safe: 
      Position1: A? okay? 
      Position2: N? okay (because not position4? and we haven't tried at2? it's new) 
      Position3: G? new? 
      Position4: R? okay? (because not position2? and we haven't tried at4) 
      Position5: Y? 

   Similarly, ""ADORN"" is safe: 
      Position1: A? 
      Position2: D? 
      Position3: O? 
      Position4: R? 
      position5: N? 

   Both are valid? 

   But note: the secret word might have A at position1? Or not? We don't know? 

   We are going to get feedback? 

   It's arbitrary? Let me pick ""ANGRY"" because it uses common letters? 

   Or ""ADORN""?

   Maybe ""ADORN"" is less common? 

   Another idea: the feedback told us that the word does not have C or E? So maybe the vowels? The secret word might have O? or U? We don't know? 

   We can use both? 

   I'll pick ""ADORN""

   But why not ""RANKS""? 
      R at position1? 
      A at position2? 
      N at position3? 
      K at position4? 
      S at position5? 
      This avoids: R at2? not using position2 for R? R at1 -> good? 
      A not at3? here at2? okay? 
      N at3? We know it wasn't at4? Okay? 
      Also K and S? 

      But note: we have already tried position3? In the first guess, position3 had A? Now we put N? So that's a change? 

   But wait: does ""RANKS"" have R, A, N? yes? 

   Also no E or C? 

   And positions: 
      1: R? okay? 
      2: A? okay? 
      3: N? okay? 
      4: K? new? 
      5: S? new? 

   But we know that N is not at position4? Here we put N at position3? okay? 

   So ""RANKS"" is valid? 

   We have many choices? 

   So let me pick one? 

   Given the time, I'll choose ""ADORN"" because I thought of it first? 

   Or let me choose ""RANKS""? 

   Actually, let me think about commonality? ""RANKS"" might be more common? 

   But we don't know? 

   We can also consider: the first guess had R at position2? and we got '-', meaning R is somewhere else? So if we put R at position1? then we might get a '✓'? Or a '-'? 

   Similarly, we might get positions for A and N? 

   We'll learn? 

   I'll go with ""RANKS"": 
      R at position1? 
      A at position2? 
      N at position3? 
      K at position4? 
      S at position5? 

   But the feedback told us N is not at position4? But we are putting N at position3? which is fine? 

   Also, note: we haven't tested positions 1 and 5? Only 2,3,4? 

   Wait: our first guess tested positions 1 to 5? 
        Position1: C -> x? So C not present? 
        Position2: R -> -? so R present but wrong position? 
        Position3: A -> -? A present but wrong position? 
        Position4: N -> -? N present but wrong position? 
        Position5: E -> x? 

   So we haven't got any information about whether a letter is at position1? So testing R at position1? is a new position? 

   Similarly, position5? 

   Therefore, we should test new positions? 

   Which of the words uses new positions? Both ""ADORN"" and ""RANKS"" and ""ANGRY"" use different positions? 

   Specifically, ""RANKS"" tests positions: 
        R at1 (new)
        A at2 (we know position2 is R? but we are putting A? so if A is at2 then it's incorrect? but we don't know? Actually, the secret word doesn't have R at2? But we don't know about A at2? So we are testing it? 
        N at3 (originally A? same position? but different letter? we'll get new feedback? 
        K at4 (originally N? which we know is wrong? so if K is there is new? 
        S at5 (new) 

   Actually, we know position4: we got N at4? and it was wrong? So in the secret word, whatever letter at position4? and we put K? So if the secret word has K at position4? we get '✓'? If K is in the word but elsewhere? we get '-'? else 'x'? 

   Similarly, position3: originally A? we got '-'? meaning A is in the word but not here? So position3 must be another letter? Now we put N? So if N is at3? then it might be correct? 

   Therefore, ""RANKS"" seems okay? 

   However, let me compare to ""ADORN"": 
        Position1: A? originally C? which was wrong? now A? if correct? 
        Position2: D? new? 
        Position3: O? originally A? 
        Position4: R? originally N? 
        Position5: N? originally E? 

   So both test new placements? 

   I think both are valid? 

   I'll pick ""ADORN"" because I want to avoid the known bad positions? 

   Actually, I change my mind: let me choose ""RANKS"" because it uses two common consonants? 

   But I'll stick to ""ADORN""? 

   Let me flip a coin? 

   I'll choose ""ADORN""

   So guessed word: adorn

   Format: <guess>adorn</guess>

   But wait: ""ADORN"" is spelled A-D-O-R-N? So letters: A, D, O, R, N? 

   And positions: A at1, D at2, O at3, R at4, N at5? 

   So written as: ""adorn""

   Let me write:After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know:
- C and E are not in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").
- R, A, and N are in the word but in incorrect positions: R is not at position 2, A is not at position 3, and N is not at position 4.

For the second guess, we need a word that includes R, A, and N (since they are confirmed present), avoids C and E, and places R, A, and N in new positions to test potential correct placements. The word ""adorn"" (A-D-O-R-N) meets these criteria:
- Uses letters A, D, O, R, N (includes R, A, N).
- Avoids C and E.
- Places A at position 1 (new position, wasn't tested before).
- Places R at position 4 (avoiding position 2 where we know it's incorrect).
- Places N at position 5 (avoiding position 4 where we know it's incorrect).
- Introduces two new letters (D and O) for further testing.

This guess maximizes information by testing new positions for known letters and bringing in additional letters not previously guessed.",Guess 2: adorn -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(-) R(-) N(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,MANOR,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, the secret word contains R, A, and N, but not C or E.
 Also, R, A, and N are not in the positions they were in ""crane"".

 The positions in ""crane"" are:
  1: C (wrong letter)
  2: R (in word but not here)
  3: A (in word but not here)
  4: N (in word but not here)
  5: E (wrong letter)

 Since R, A, and N are in the word but not at positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively, they must be elsewhere.

 We know the word is 5 letters and must include R, A, N and exclude C and E.

 Also, note that the word cannot have C or E.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that uses R, A, N and avoids C and E.

 We also want to try to place new letters to get more information, but we must include the known letters (R, A, N) but in different positions.

 Since R cannot be at position 2, and similarly A not at 3, N not at 4, we can try placing them in other positions.

 We have positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 available.

 Possibilities for R: can be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: our feedback says R is in the word but not at position 2. Similarly for A and N.

 We must try a word that has:
   - R not at position 2
   - A not at position 3
   - N not at position 4

 And we must include R, A, N (and two more letters that are not C or E).

 We also want to try two new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common words that have R, A, N and two other consonants or vowels? Since we cannot use E, we might use other vowels like I, O, U? Or consonants.

 The word might have another vowel? Because we have A, but maybe more vowels? Or it could have other consonants.

 Since we know the word has at least three letters: R, A, N.

 Let me try to form a word that has R, A, N in positions different from 2,3,4.

 Example positions: 
   R could go in position 1? Or position 3? 
   But note: in the first guess, position 3 was A, so R could be at 1? 
   Also A cannot be at position 3, so A could be at 1,2,4,5? But wait: position 4 was N, which is also not allowed for A? Actually, no: the restriction for A is only that it cannot be at position 3. Similarly, N cannot be at 4.

 So, possible positions for letters:
   Position 1: can be R? or A? or N? or a new letter?
   Position 2: cannot be R? Actually, we know R cannot be at position 2? But we can put A or N or a new letter at position 2? Yes.

 However, note: position 2: we had R and got a '-' meaning R is in the word but not here. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? But we are going to form a new word anyway.

 We are going to make a new guess, so we can try:

 Option: place R at position 1? Then A must not be at position 3, so we can put A at position 4? Then N must not be at position 4? But if we put A at 4, then N cannot be at 4? We can put N at position 2? Or position 5?

 But note: we also need two more letters.

 Let me try to think of words containing R, A, N.

 Also, remember we have two positions to fill with new letters.

 Since E and C are out, we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? (but no E,C)

 Common words: 
   ""RAN"" is three letters, so we need five letters.

 Words: 
   ""GRAND"" -> G, R, A, N, D. But let's check positions:
      Position 1: G (new)
      Position 2: R (but we know R cannot be at position 2? Actually, we don't know that the secret word doesn't have R at position 2? Wait, no: we got '-' for R at position 2 meaning that it is in the word but not in that position. So in the secret word, R is not at position 2? Therefore, if we put R at position 2 again, it would be wrong? But the feedback told us that R is not at position 2. So we should avoid putting R at position 2 in our next guess? Actually, no: we can put R at any position in the next guess, because we are just testing. But why risk? We already know that in the secret word, R is not at position 2. So we can avoid it to get a correct feedback.

 However, note: by avoiding R at position 2, we can get a '-' or '✓' in a different position. But if we put R at position 2 again, we might get '-' again? But wait: if R is not at position 2 in the secret word, then putting R at position 2 again would give us '-' because the letter R is present but not in position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong position will be '-' regardless of where we put it? But if we put it in the same wrong position again, we get '-' again? And we haven't learned anything new? So better to put R in a position we haven't tried.

 Similarly, avoid A in position 3 and N in position 4.

 So let's avoid:

   Position 2: R
   Position 3: A
   Position 4: N

 Therefore, for our next guess, we want:

   R in {1,3,4,5} but we have to pick one? Actually, we can pick any except 2? Yes.

   But note: we also want to try new positions for R? Because we only know it's not at 2.

   Similarly, A should be in {1,2,4,5} (not 3)
   N should be in {1,2,3,5} (not 4)

 Now, let's form a word.

 We also want to use two new letters to get more information.

 Idea: try R at position 1? Then what? 

   Position 1: R
   Then A: cannot be at 3? So we can try A at position 2? But position 2: can we put A? Yes, because we haven't tried A at position 2? We only know A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, we can put N at position 3? But then we must avoid placing N at position 4? And at position 3 is okay? Yes, because N can be at 3? But then we would need two more letters at positions 4 and 5.

   So: R at 1, A at 2? and then N at 3? Then we have R A N at positions 1,2,3. But then we have two letters left? And we have to avoid C and E? So positions 4 and 5: two new letters.

   Example: ""RANCH"" -> but H is new? But wait, we cannot use C? Because we know C is not in the word? So avoid C? 

   We need words without C and E.

   Alternative: ""RANDY"" -> R, A, N, D, Y -> D and Y are new? Let me check: ""RANDY"" is a word? Yes.

   But check positions: 
      Pos1: R -> is R allowed? We are trying R at 1? 
      Pos2: A -> but we know A is in the word but not at position 3? But we haven't tested position 2? Actually, we don't know if A is at position 2? It might be? So this is valid.
      Pos3: N -> we know N is not at position 4? But we are putting N at position 3? That's okay? Yes.

   Then positions 4 and 5: D and Y? But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not at position 4? So if we put N at position 3, that's okay? Yes.

   Similarly, R at 1: we don't know if that's the correct position? We'll find out.

   Alternatively, we might try using a word that places the known letters in completely new positions? For example, put R at position 4? A at position 1? Etc.

   However, let's consider: we also want to test new letters? In ""RANDY"", we introduce D and Y? That might be good? 

   But what if the secret word has a double letter? Not necessarily? We don't know.

   Another word: ""TRAIN"" -> T, R, A, I, N. This has T and I? And avoids C and E? But let's check positions:

      Position 1: T (new)
      Position 2: R -> we know R not at position 2? Trying R again at position 2 might give '-'? But why waste? Because we know it's not there? So better avoid? So skip.

   Alternatively, ""ADORN"" -> A, D, O, R, N -> 

      Positions:
        A at position 1? (A can be at position 1? because we don't know yet? Actually, we only know A is not at 3? So putting at 1 is okay)
        D at position 2? (new)
        O at position 3? (new) -> but note: position 3: originally A? Now we put O? okay.
        R at position 4? (so not at 2? we know R not at 2? So putting at 4 is fine? Yes)
        N at position 5? (because we cannot put at position 4? and putting at 5 is okay)

   And positions: 
        A at position 1: we haven't tried before -> good?
        R at position 4: new position -> good.
        N at position 5: new position -> good.

   Also introducing D and O? So two new letters? That's good? 

   So ""ADORN"" might be a good candidate.

   But consider: what if the secret word has two R's? We don't know? But we have only been told one R? Similarly for A and N? But wait: in the first guess, we had one of each? So if there were duplicates, the feedback might show more? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed? So if we guess one R and there are two R's, but both are wrong position? Or one is correct and one isn't?

   However, we only guessed one R? So we don't know? But in our next guess, we should not duplicate letters? Because we don't have information? Or we can? But if we duplicate, then we might get multiple feedbacks? And we don't know? We have no reason to duplicate? So let's avoid?

   Therefore, let's choose a word with distinct letters? 

   Check: ""ADORN"": A, D, O, R, N -> all distinct? Yes? (A, D, O, R, N -> 5 distinct letters)

   Also, we know the secret word has R, A, N? So ""ADORN"" is okay? 

   But also, we don't know other letters? So let me do ""ADORN""

   Alternatively, we might use ""ORGAN"" -> O, R, G, A, N -> distinct? 

      Positions: 
        O at position 1 (new)
        R at position 2 -> but we know R cannot be at position 2? So we avoid? Because it will give '-' and we know that already? So we want to avoid positions we know are wrong? For R: position 2 is known wrong? So if we put R at 2 we get minus? But that doesn't tell us anything? So skip. 

   Therefore, avoid putting known letters in positions we already know are wrong? So in ""ORGAN"", R is at position 2? which we know is wrong? So we don't want that? So better to choose a word that puts R at a new position? Like in ""ADORN"" we put R at 4? Good.

   Similarly, we put A at position 1? which we haven't tested? and N at position 5? which we haven't tested? 

   So ""ADORN"" seems a good candidate?

   Other words? ""RANIS""? No? Not a word? 

   ""DAIRY"" -> does not have R, A, N? but only R? Wait: we must include R, A, N? 

   Why must we include? Because we know they are there? So we should use them? Otherwise we might lose a chance to get a correct position? 

   Rule: we are allowed to guess words without R, A, N? But then we might waste? For example, if we guess a word without R, A, N, then we get all feedback of 'x'? And we lose the chance to check the positions? So we should use R, A, N? 

   Therefore, ""ADORN"" is a good choice? 

   Let me double-check: 

   Letters: A, D, O, R, N -> contains A, R, N? Yes.

   Positions: 
      Position 1: A -> not position 3? okay? 
      Position 2: D -> new
      Position 3: O -> new
      Position 4: R -> not position 2? okay? 
      Position 5: N -> not position 4? okay? 

   So we are testing A at position 1, R at position 4, and N at position 5? Also testing D and O? 

   If we get feedback, we might get more clues.

   Alternatively, we can try ""BARNY""? B, A, R, N, Y? But B and Y? But positions: 
      Position1: B -> new
      Position2: A -> can we put A at position2? yes? 
      Position3: R? -> but wait, R? We put R at position3? but originally R was at position2? we are shifting? 
      Position4: N? -> but we know N is not at position4? So we cannot put N at position4? Oh wait: feedback told us N is not at position4? So we must not put N at position4? But in ""BARNY"", N is at position4? That would be a mistake? Because we know it's not there? That would cause a '-'? So we avoid? 

   Therefore, ""BARNY"" has N at position4? which is known wrong? So skip.

   Another idea: ""ANGRY"" -> A, N, G, R, Y? 
      Position1: A? (so A not at position3? okay)
      Position2: N? -> we haven't tried? but we know N is not at position4? but position2 is new? okay? 
      Position3: G? new? 
      Position4: R? -> we know R is not at position2? Put at position4? okay? 
      Position5: Y? 

   But note: we have two Ns? Wait: no? ""ANGRY"" has one A, one N, one G, one R, one Y? 
      Positions: 
        A at position1? okay?
        N at position2? but we don't know if N can be at2? okay? 
        R at position4? okay? 

   Also, avoids known bad positions? 

   Therefore, ""ANGRY"" is also a candidate? 

   Now, between ""ADORN"" and ""ANGRY"", which one? Both are valid? 

   But in ""ANGRY"", we put A at position1 and N at position2? which we didn't test before? 
   And R at position4? 
   Also G and Y? 

   But note: we have already tried position2: in the first guess, position2 was R? Now we're putting N? That's a different letter? And we don't know? 

   Similarly, in ""ADORN"", we put D at position2? Now position2 is a different letter? 

   Both seem fine? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""RAINY"" -> 
      Position1: R (which we know? but new position? position1) -> okay? 
      Position2: A -> but wait: we know R cannot be at2? But A? Is A allowed at2? Yes? 
      Position3: I? -> new? 
      Position4: N? -> but we know N not at4? So we cannot? Skip! 

   So ""RAINY"" has N at position4? We must avoid position4 for N? So skip.

   Let me pick ""ADORN"" then? Or ""ANGRY""? 

   We might also consider ""TARNS"": T, A, R, N, S? 
      Positions: 
        1: T new? 
        2: A -> okay? 
        3: R? -> okay? 
        4: N? -> bad? We must avoid for N? So skip.

   Therefore, words that avoid placing A at3, R at2, N at4? 

   We can try ""GAUNT"": G, A, U, N, T? 
      Position1: G -> new?
      Position2: A -> okay? 
      Position3: U -> new?
      Position4: N -> bad? skip.

   So ""GAUNT"" fails? 

   Let me pick ""ADORN"" or ""ANGRY""? 

   Another word: ""DRAIN"": D, R, A, I, N? 
      Position1: D? new?
      Position2: R? -> bad? because we know R not at2? So skip? 

   So avoid words with R at position2? 

   Also, avoid words with A at3? and with N at4? 

   Therefore, ""ANGRY"" seems safe: 
      Position1: A? okay? 
      Position2: N? okay (because not position4? and we haven't tried at2? it's new) 
      Position3: G? new? 
      Position4: R? okay? (because not position2? and we haven't tried at4) 
      Position5: Y? 

   Similarly, ""ADORN"" is safe: 
      Position1: A? 
      Position2: D? 
      Position3: O? 
      Position4: R? 
      position5: N? 

   Both are valid? 

   But note: the secret word might have A at position1? Or not? We don't know? 

   We are going to get feedback? 

   It's arbitrary? Let me pick ""ANGRY"" because it uses common letters? 

   Or ""ADORN""?

   Maybe ""ADORN"" is less common? 

   Another idea: the feedback told us that the word does not have C or E? So maybe the vowels? The secret word might have O? or U? We don't know? 

   We can use both? 

   I'll pick ""ADORN""

   But why not ""RANKS""? 
      R at position1? 
      A at position2? 
      N at position3? 
      K at position4? 
      S at position5? 
      This avoids: R at2? not using position2 for R? R at1 -> good? 
      A not at3? here at2? okay? 
      N at3? We know it wasn't at4? Okay? 
      Also K and S? 

      But note: we have already tried position3? In the first guess, position3 had A? Now we put N? So that's a change? 

   But wait: does ""RANKS"" have R, A, N? yes? 

   Also no E or C? 

   And positions: 
      1: R? okay? 
      2: A? okay? 
      3: N? okay? 
      4: K? new? 
      5: S? new? 

   But we know that N is not at position4? Here we put N at position3? okay? 

   So ""RANKS"" is valid? 

   We have many choices? 

   So let me pick one? 

   Given the time, I'll choose ""ADORN"" because I thought of it first? 

   Or let me choose ""RANKS""? 

   Actually, let me think about commonality? ""RANKS"" might be more common? 

   But we don't know? 

   We can also consider: the first guess had R at position2? and we got '-', meaning R is somewhere else? So if we put R at position1? then we might get a '✓'? Or a '-'? 

   Similarly, we might get positions for A and N? 

   We'll learn? 

   I'll go with ""RANKS"": 
      R at position1? 
      A at position2? 
      N at position3? 
      K at position4? 
      S at position5? 

   But the feedback told us N is not at position4? But we are putting N at position3? which is fine? 

   Also, note: we haven't tested positions 1 and 5? Only 2,3,4? 

   Wait: our first guess tested positions 1 to 5? 
        Position1: C -> x? So C not present? 
        Position2: R -> -? so R present but wrong position? 
        Position3: A -> -? A present but wrong position? 
        Position4: N -> -? N present but wrong position? 
        Position5: E -> x? 

   So we haven't got any information about whether a letter is at position1? So testing R at position1? is a new position? 

   Similarly, position5? 

   Therefore, we should test new positions? 

   Which of the words uses new positions? Both ""ADORN"" and ""RANKS"" and ""ANGRY"" use different positions? 

   Specifically, ""RANKS"" tests positions: 
        R at1 (new)
        A at2 (we know position2 is R? but we are putting A? so if A is at2 then it's incorrect? but we don't know? Actually, the secret word doesn't have R at2? But we don't know about A at2? So we are testing it? 
        N at3 (originally A? same position? but different letter? we'll get new feedback? 
        K at4 (originally N? which we know is wrong? so if K is there is new? 
        S at5 (new) 

   Actually, we know position4: we got N at4? and it was wrong? So in the secret word, whatever letter at position4? and we put K? So if the secret word has K at position4? we get '✓'? If K is in the word but elsewhere? we get '-'? else 'x'? 

   Similarly, position3: originally A? we got '-'? meaning A is in the word but not here? So position3 must be another letter? Now we put N? So if N is at3? then it might be correct? 

   Therefore, ""RANKS"" seems okay? 

   However, let me compare to ""ADORN"": 
        Position1: A? originally C? which was wrong? now A? if correct? 
        Position2: D? new? 
        Position3: O? originally A? 
        Position4: R? originally N? 
        Position5: N? originally E? 

   So both test new placements? 

   I think both are valid? 

   I'll pick ""ADORN"" because I want to avoid the known bad positions? 

   Actually, I change my mind: let me choose ""RANKS"" because it uses two common consonants? 

   But I'll stick to ""ADORN""? 

   Let me flip a coin? 

   I'll choose ""ADORN""

   So guessed word: adorn

   Format: <guess>adorn</guess>

   But wait: ""ADORN"" is spelled A-D-O-R-N? So letters: A, D, O, R, N? 

   And positions: A at1, D at2, O at3, R at4, N at5? 

   So written as: ""adorn""

   Let me write:After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know:
- C and E are not in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").
- R, A, and N are in the word but in incorrect positions: R is not at position 2, A is not at position 3, and N is not at position 4.

For the second guess, we need a word that includes R, A, and N (since they are confirmed present), avoids C and E, and places R, A, and N in new positions to test potential correct placements. The word ""adorn"" (A-D-O-R-N) meets these criteria:
- Uses letters A, D, O, R, N (includes R, A, N).
- Avoids C and E.
- Places A at position 1 (new position, wasn't tested before).
- Places R at position 4 (avoiding position 2 where we know it's incorrect).
- Places N at position 5 (avoiding position 4 where we know it's incorrect).
- Introduces two new letters (D and O) for further testing.

This guess maximizes information by testing new positions for known letters and bringing in additional letters not previously guessed.

But note: our feedback says R is in the word but not at position 2. Similarly for A and N.\n\n We must try a word that has:\n   - R not at position 2\n   - A not at position 3\n   - N not at position 4\n\n And we must include R, A, N (and two more letters that are not C or E).\n\n We also want to try two new letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of common words that have R, A, N and two other consonants or vowels? Since we cannot use E, we might use other vowels like I, O, U? Or consonants.\n\n The word might have another vowel? Because we have A, but maybe more vowels? Or it could have other consonants.\n\n Since we know the word has at least three letters: R, A, N.\n\n Let me try to form a word that has R, A, N in positions different from 2,3,4.\n\n Example positions: \n   R could go in position 1? Or position 3? \n   But note: in the first guess, position 3 was A, so R could be at 1? \n   Also A cannot be at position 3, so A could be at 1,2,4,5? But wait: position 4 was N, which is also not allowed for A? Actually, no: the restriction for A is only that it cannot be at position 3. Similarly, N cannot be at 4.\n\n So, possible positions for letters:\n   Position 1: can be R? or A? or N? or a new letter?\n   Position 2: cannot be R? Actually, we know R cannot be at position 2? But we can put A or N or a new letter at position 2? Yes.\n\n However, note: position 2: we had R and got a \'-\' meaning R is in the word but not here. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? But we are going to form a new word anyway.\n\n We are going to make a new guess, so we can try:\n\n Option: place R at position 1? Then A must not be at position 3, so we can put A at position 4? Then N must not be at position 4? But if we put A at 4, then N cannot be at 4? We can put N at position 2? Or position 5?\n\n But note: we also need two more letters.\n\n Let me try to think of words containing R, A, N.\n\n Also, remember we have two positions to fill with new letters.\n\n Since E and C are out, we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? (but no E,C)\n\n Common words: \n   ""RAN"" is three letters, so we need five letters.\n\n Words: \n   ""GRAND"" -> G, R, A, N, D. But let\'s check positions:\n      Position 1: G (new)\n      Position 2: R (but we know R cannot be at position 2? Actually, we don\'t know that the secret word doesn\'t have R at position 2? Wait, no: we got \'-\' for R at position 2 meaning that it is in the word but not in that position. So in the secret word, R is not at position 2? Therefore, if we put R at position 2 again, it would be wrong? But the feedback told us that R is not at position 2. So we should avoid putting R at position 2 in our next guess? Actually, no: we can put R at any position in the next guess, because we are just testing. But why risk? We already know that in the secret word, R is not at position 2. So we can avoid it to get a correct feedback.\n\n However, note: by avoiding R at position 2, we can get a \'-\' or \'✓\' in a different position. But if we put R at position 2 again, we might get \'-\' again? But wait: if R is not at position 2 in the secret word, then putting R at position 2 again would give us \'-\' because the letter R is present but not in position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong position will be \'-\' regardless of where we put it? But if we put it in the same wrong position again, we get \'-\' again? And we haven\'t learned anything new? So better to put R in a position we haven\'t tried.\n\n Similarly, avoid A in position 3 and N in position 4.\n\n So let\'s avoid:\n\n   Position 2: R\n   Position 3: A\n   Position 4: N\n\n Therefore, for our next guess, we want:\n\n   R in {1,3,4,5} but we have to pick one? Actually, we can pick any except 2? Yes.\n\n   But note: we also want to try new positions for R? Because we only know it\'s not at 2.\n\n   Similarly, A should be in {1,2,4,5} (not 3)\n   N should be in {1,2,3,5} (not 4)\n\n Now, let\'s form a word.\n\n We also want to use two new letters to get more information.\n\n Idea: try R at position 1? Then what? \n\n   Position 1: R\n   Then A: cannot be at 3? So we can try A at position 2? But position 2: can we put A? Yes, because we haven\'t tried A at position 2? We only know A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, we can put N at position 3? But then we must avoid placing N at position 4? And at position 3 is okay? Yes, because N can be at 3? But then we would need two more letters at positions 4 and 5.\n\n   So: R at 1, A at 2? and then N at 3? Then we have R A N at positions 1,2,3. But then we have two letters left? And we have to avoid C and E? So positions 4 and 5: two new letters.\n\n   Example: ""RANCH"" -> but H is new? But wait, we cannot use C? Because we know C is not in the word? So avoid C? \n\n   We need words without C and E.\n\n   Alternative: ""RANDY"" -> R, A, N, D, Y -> D and Y are new? Let me check: ""RANDY"" is a word? Yes.\n\n   But check positions: \n      Pos1: R -> is R allowed? We are trying R at 1? \n      Pos2: A -> but we know A is in the word but not at position 3? But we haven\'t tested position 2? Actually, we don\'t know if A is at position 2? It might be? So this is valid.\n      Pos3: N -> we know N is not at position 4? But we are putting N at position 3? That\'s okay? Yes.\n\n   Then positions 4 and 5: D and Y? But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not at position 4? So if we put N at position 3, that\'s okay? Yes.\n\n   Similarly, R at 1: we don\'t know if that\'s the correct position? We\'ll find out.\n\n   Alternatively, we might try using a word that places the known letters in completely new positions? For example, put R at position 4? A at position 1? Etc.\n\n   However, let\'s consider: we also want to test new letters? In ""RANDY"", we introduce D and Y? That might be good? \n\n   But what if the secret word has a double letter? Not necessarily? We don\'t know.\n\n   Another word: ""TRAIN"" -> T, R, A, I, N. This has T and I? And avoids C and E? But let\'s check positions:\n\n      Position 1: T (new)\n      Position 2: R -> we know R not at position 2? Trying R again at position 2 might give \'-\'? But why waste? Because we know it\'s not there? So better avoid? So skip.\n\n   Alternatively, ""ADORN"" -> A, D, O, R, N -> \n\n      Positions:\n        A at position 1? (A can be at position 1? because we don\'t know yet? Actually, we only know A is not at 3? So putting at 1 is okay)\n        D at position 2? (new)\n        O at position 3? (new) -> but note: position 3: originally A? Now we put O? okay.\n        R at position 4? (so not at 2? we know R not at 2? So putting at 4 is fine? Yes)\n        N at position 5? (because we cannot put at position 4? and putting at 5 is okay)\n\n   And positions: \n        A at position 1: we haven\'t tried before -> good?\n        R at position 4: new position -> good.\n        N at position 5: new position -> good.\n\n   Also introducing D and O? So two new letters? That\'s good? \n\n   So ""ADORN"" might be a good candidate.\n\n   But consider: what if the secret word has two R\'s? We don\'t know? But we have only been told one R? Similarly for A and N? But wait: in the first guess, we had one of each? So if there were duplicates, the feedback might show more? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed? So if we guess one R and there are two R\'s, but both are wrong position? Or one is correct and one isn\'t?\n\n   However, we only guessed one R? So we don\'t know? But in our next guess, we should not duplicate letters? Because we don\'t have information? Or we can? But if we duplicate, then we might get multiple feedbacks? And we don\'t know? We have no reason to duplicate? So let\'s avoid?\n\n   Therefore, let\'s choose a word with distinct letters? \n\n   Check: ""ADORN"": A, D, O, R, N -> all distinct? Yes? (A, D, O, R, N -> 5 distinct letters)\n\n   Also, we know the secret word has R, A, N? So ""ADORN"" is okay? \n\n   But also, we don\'t know other letters? So let me do ""ADORN""\n\n   Alternatively, we might use ""ORGAN"" -> O, R, G, A, N -> distinct? \n\n      Positions: \n        O at position 1 (new)\n        R at position 2 -> but we know R cannot be at position 2? So we avoid? Because it will give \'-\' and we know that already? So we want to avoid positions we know are wrong? For R: position 2 is known wrong? So if we put R at 2 we get minus? But that doesn\'t tell us anything? So skip. \n\n   Therefore, avoid putting known letters in positions we already know are wrong? So in ""ORGAN"", R is at position 2? which we know is wrong? So we don\'t want that? So better to choose a word that puts R at a new position? Like in ""ADORN"" we put R at 4? Good.\n\n   Similarly, we put A at position 1? which we haven\'t tested? and N at position 5? which we haven\'t tested? \n\n   So ""ADORN"" seems a good candidate?\n\n   Other words? ""RANIS""? No? Not a word? \n\n   ""DAIRY"" -> does not have R, A, N? but only R? Wait: we must include R, A, N? \n\n   Why must we include? Because we know they are there? So we should use them? Otherwise we might lose a chance to get a correct position? \n\n   Rule: we are allowed to guess words without R, A, N? But then we might waste? For example, if we guess a word without R, A, N, then we get all feedback of \'x\'? And we lose the chance to check the positions? So we should use R, A, N? \n\n   Therefore, ""ADORN"" is a good choice? \n\n   Let me double-check: \n\n   Letters: A, D, O, R, N -> contains A, R, N? Yes.\n\n   Positions: \n      Position 1: A -> not position 3? okay? \n      Position 2: D -> new\n      Position 3: O -> new\n      Position 4: R -> not position 2? okay? \n      Position 5: N -> not position 4? okay? \n\n   So we are testing A at position 1, R at position 4, and N at position 5? Also testing D and O? \n\n   If we get feedback, we might get more clues.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""BARNY""? B, A, R, N, Y? But B and Y? But positions: \n      Position1: B -> new\n      Position2: A -> can we put A at position2? yes? \n      Position3: R? -> but wait, R? We put R at position3? but originally R was at position2? we are shifting? \n      Position4: N? -> but we know N is not at position4? So we cannot put N at position4? Oh wait: feedback told us N is not at position4? So we must not put N at position4? But in ""BARNY"", N is at position4? That would be a mistake? Because we know it\'s not there? That would cause a \'-\'? So we avoid? \n\n   Therefore, ""BARNY"" has N at position4? which is known wrong? So skip.\n\n   Another idea: ""ANGRY"" -> A, N, G, R, Y? \n      Position1: A? (so A not at position3? okay)\n      Position2: N? -> we haven\'t tried? but we know N is not at position4? but position2 is new? okay? \n      Position3: G? new? \n      Position4: R? -> we know R is not at position2? Put at position4? okay? \n      Position5: Y? \n\n   But note: we have two Ns? Wait: no? ""ANGRY"" has one A, one N, one G, one R, one Y? \n      Positions: \n        A at position1? okay?\n        N at position2? but we don\'t know if N can be at2? okay? \n        R at position4? okay? \n\n   Also, avoids known bad positions? \n\n   Therefore, ""ANGRY"" is also a candidate? \n\n   Now, between ""ADORN"" and ""ANGRY"", which one? Both are valid? \n\n   But in ""ANGRY"", we put A at position1 and N at position2? which we didn\'t test before? \n   And R at position4? \n   Also G and Y? \n\n   But note: we have already tried position2: in the first guess, position2 was R? Now we\'re putting N? That\'s a different letter? And we don\'t know? \n\n   Similarly, in ""ADORN"", we put D at position2? Now position2 is a different letter? \n\n   Both seem fine? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose ""RAINY"" -> \n      Position1: R (which we know? but new position? position1) -> okay? \n      Position2: A -> but wait: we know R cannot be at2? But A? Is A allowed at2? Yes? \n      Position3: I? -> new? \n      Position4: N? -> but we know N not at4? So we cannot? Skip! \n\n   So ""RAINY"" has N at position4? We must avoid position4 for N? So skip.\n\n   Let me pick ""ADORN"" then? Or ""ANGRY""? \n\n   We might also consider ""TARNS"": T, A, R, N, S? \n      Positions: \n        1: T new? \n        2: A -> okay? \n        3: R? -> okay? \n        4: N? -> bad? We must avoid for N? So skip.\n\n   Therefore, words that avoid placing A at3, R at2, N at4? \n\n   We can try ""GAUNT"": G, A, U, N, T? \n      Position1: G -> new?\n      Position2: A -> okay? \n      Position3: U -> new?\n      Position4: N -> bad? skip.\n\n   So ""GAUNT"" fails? \n\n   Let me pick ""ADORN"" or ""ANGRY""? \n\n   Another word: ""DRAIN"": D, R, A, I, N? \n      Position1: D? new?\n      Position2: R? -> bad? because we know R not at2? So skip? \n\n   So avoid words with R at position2? \n\n   Also, avoid words with A at3? and with N at4? \n\n   Therefore, ""ANGRY"" seems safe: \n      Position1: A? okay? \n      Position2: N? okay (because not position4? and we haven\'t tried at2? it\'s new) \n      Position3: G? new? \n      Position4: R? okay? (because not position2? and we haven\'t tried at4) \n      Position5: Y? \n\n   Similarly, ""ADORN"" is safe: \n      Position1: A? \n      Position2: D? \n      Position3: O? \n      Position4: R? \n      position5: N? \n\n   Both are valid? \n\n   But note: the secret word might have A at position1? Or not? We don\'t know? \n\n   We are going to get feedback? \n\n   It\'s arbitrary? Let me pick ""ANGRY"" because it uses common letters? \n\n   Or ""ADORN""?\n\n   Maybe ""ADORN"" is less common? \n\n   Another idea: the feedback told us that the word does not have C or E? So maybe the vowels? The secret word might have O? or U? We don\'t know? \n\n   We can use both? \n\n   I\'ll pick ""ADORN""\n\n   But why not ""RANKS""? \n      R at position1? \n      A at position2? \n      N at position3? \n      K at position4? \n      S at position5? \n      This avoids: R at2? not using position2 for R? R at1 -> good? \n      A not at3? here at2? okay? \n      N at3? We know it wasn\'t at4? Okay? \n      Also K and S? \n\n      But note: we have already tried position3? In the first guess, position3 had A? Now we put N? So that\'s a change? \n\n   But wait: does ""RANKS"" have R, A, N? yes? \n\n   Also no E or C? \n\n   And positions: \n      1: R? okay? \n      2: A? okay? \n      3: N? okay? \n      4: K? new? \n      5: S? new? \n\n   But we know that N is not at position4? Here we put N at position3? okay? \n\n   So ""RANKS"" is valid? \n\n   We have many choices? \n\n   So let me pick one? \n\n   Given the time, I\'ll choose ""ADORN"" because I thought of it first? \n\n   Or let me choose ""RANKS""? \n\n   Actually, let me think about commonality? ""RANKS"" might be more common? \n\n   But we don\'t know? \n\n   We can also consider: the first guess had R at position2? and we got \'-\', meaning R is somewhere else? So if we put R at position1? then we might get a \'✓\'? Or a \'-\'? \n\n   Similarly, we might get positions for A and N? \n\n   We\'ll learn? \n\n   I\'ll go with ""RANKS"": \n      R at position1? \n      A at position2? \n      N at position3? \n      K at position4? \n      S at position5? \n\n   But the feedback told us N is not at position4? But we are putting N at position3? which is fine? \n\n   Also, note: we haven\'t tested positions 1 and 5? Only 2,3,4? \n\n   Wait: our first guess tested positions 1 to 5? \n        Position1: C -> x? So C not present? \n        Position2: R -> -? so R present but wrong position? \n        Position3: A -> -? A present but wrong position? \n        Position4: N -> -? N present but wrong position? \n        Position5: E -> x? \n\n   So we haven\'t got any information about whether a letter is at position1? So testing R at position1? is a new position? \n\n   Similarly, position5? \n\n   Therefore, we should test new positions? \n\n   Which of the words uses new positions? Both ""ADORN"" and ""RANKS"" and ""ANGRY"" use different positions? \n\n   Specifically, ""RANKS"" tests positions: \n        R at1 (new)\n        A at2 (we know position2 is R? but we are putting A? so if A is at2 then it\'s incorrect? but we don\'t know? Actually, the secret word doesn\'t have R at2? But we don\'t know about A at2? So we are testing it? \n        N at3 (originally A? same position? but different letter? we\'ll get new feedback? \n        K at4 (originally N? which we know is wrong? so if K is there is new? \n        S at5 (new) \n\n   Actually, we know position4: we got N at4? and it was wrong? So in the secret word, whatever letter at position4? and we put K? So if the secret word has K at position4? we get \'✓\'? If K is in the word but elsewhere? we get \'-\'? else \'x\'? \n\n   Similarly, position3: originally A? we got \'-\'? meaning A is in the word but not here? So position3 must be another letter? Now we put N? So if N is at3? then it might be correct? \n\n   Therefore, ""RANKS"" seems okay? \n\n   However, let me compare to ""ADORN"": \n        Position1: A? originally C? which was wrong? now A? if correct? \n        Position2: D? new? \n        Position3: O? originally A? \n        Position4: R? originally N? \n        Position5: N? originally E? \n\n   So both test new placements? \n\n   I think both are valid? \n\n   I\'ll pick ""ADORN"" because I want to avoid the known bad positions? \n\n   Actually, I change my mind: let me choose ""RANKS"" because it uses two common consonants? \n\n   But I\'ll stick to ""ADORN""? \n\n   Let me flip a coin? \n\n   I\'ll choose ""ADORN""\n\n   So guessed word: adorn\n\n   Format: <guess>adorn</guess>\n\n   But wait: ""ADORN"" is spelled A-D-O-R-N? So letters: A, D, O, R, N? \n\n   And positions: A at1, D at2, O at3, R at4, N at5? \n\n   So written as: ""adorn""\n\n   Let me write:After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know:\n- C and E are not in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").\n- R, A, and N are in the word but in incorrect positions: R is not at position 2, A is not at position 3, and N is not at position 4.\n\nFor the second guess, we need a word that includes R, A, and N (since they are confirmed present), avoids C and E, and places R, A, and N in new positions to test potential correct placements. The word ""adorn"" (A-D-O-R-N) meets these criteria:\n- Uses letters A, D, O, R, N (includes R, A, N).\n- Avoids C and E.\n- Places A at position 1 (new position, wasn\'t tested before).\n- Places R at position 4 (avoiding position 2 where we know it\'s incorrect).\n- Places N at position 5 (avoiding position 4 where we know it\'s incorrect).\n- Introduces two new letters (D and O) for further testing.\n\nThis guess maximizes information by testing new positions for known letters and bringing in additional letters not previously guessed.\n\n<guess>adorn</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: adorn -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(-) R(-) N(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

**First Guess: crane**
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position) -> R is in the word but not at position 2
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> A is in the word but not at position 3
- N: - (in word, wrong position) -> N is in the word but not at position 4
- E: x (not in word)

**Second Guess: adorn**
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> A is in the word but not at position 1 (since we placed it at 1 and got '-')
- D: x (not in word)
- O: - (in word, wrong position) -> O is in the word but not at position 3
- R: - (in word, wrong position) -> R is in the word but not at position 4
- N: - (in word, wrong position) -> N is in the word but not at position 5

**What we know so far:**
1. **Letters in the word:** R, A, N, O (since both '-' and must be present) and we got '-' for O in guess 2.
2. **Letters not in the word:** C, E (from guess 1), D (from guess 2).
3. **Positional constraints:**
   - R cannot be at: position 2 (from guess 1), position 4 (from guess 2)
   - A cannot be at: position 3 (from guess 1), position 1 (from guess 2)
   - N cannot be at: position 4 (from guess 1), position 5 (from guess 2)
   - O cannot be at: position 3 (from guess 2)

Since we have 5 letters in the word: R, A, N, O, and one more letter? Wait: we don't know the fifth letter yet. The word is 5 letters, and we have 4 confirmed: R, A, N, O. So we need to find the fifth letter.

But note: in guess 1, we had 5 letters (crane) and three were present: R, A, N. In guess 2, we used A, D, O, R, N and got A, O, R, N present (D absent). So the word has exactly R, A, N, O and one more letter that we haven't fully identified? Yet we have feedback only on the letters guessed? So we know:

The secret word has: 
- R, A, N (from first guess) 
- and O (from second guess) 
- and one more unknown letter? 

But wait: the word is 5 letters? So if R, A, N, O are already four, we must have one more? 

However, it's possible that a letter appears twice? But we haven't guessed any duplicated letters? So currently, we think the word has four distinct known letters plus one unknown? 

But note: in guess 1, we did not guess O? So it wasn't revealed? Then in guess 2, we guessed O? and got '-'? so it is in the word? 

Therefore, the word contains R, A, N, O and one other letter? 

Also, we know that:

- The fifth letter is not C, E, D? (since they are eliminated).

**Constraints on positions:**
- A cannot be at: position 1 or 3? but we don't know? 
   Actually: 
      A is not at position 3 (from guess 1) 
      A is not at position 1 (from guess 2) 
   So A cannot be at position 1 or 3? 

- R cannot be at position 2 or 4?
- N cannot be at position 4 or 5?
- O cannot be at position 3?

Therefore, possible positions for each known letter:

For A: 
   Positions available: 2, 4, 5? 
   Because it cannot be at 1 or 3? 

Similarly, for R:
   Cannot be at 2 or 4 -> possible positions: 1, 3, 5? 

For N:
   Cannot be at 4 or 5 -> possible positions: 1, 2, 3? 

For O:
   Cannot be at 3 -> possible positions: 1, 2, 4, 5? 

But note: we have a fifth letter? which must be in the word? and must fit in the positions not occupied by R,A,N,O? 

However, we don't know what the fifth letter is? 

So we need to make a guess that includes R, A, N, O and one more letter that is not C, E, D? 

Moreover, we must place these five letters? 

But note: we have two guesses? so we have tried 2? and have 4 left? 

We also have constraints on positions? 

Let me form possible placements:

Known constraints:

The word must have exactly five letters: R, A, N, O, and one more? 

We need to consider possibilities? 

First, look for a word that uses R, A, N, O and one other letter? 

Since the fifth letter is unknown? we can try to guess? 

But we try to choose a word that can help us? 

We must avoid putting letters in positions we know they cannot be? 

So we have to assign:

- R must be at positions 1, 3, or 5? 
- A must be at positions 2, 4, or 5? 
- N must be at positions 1, 2, or 3? 
- O must be at positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? 

Now, we also have the fifth letter? that we'll call X? It's one letter? that we don't know? and must appear in the position of the remaining? 

We need a valid word? 

We list possible positions:

Position 1: R or N or O? (because R can be at1, N at1, O at1)? 

Also, position 1 could be the unknown X? 

Similarly? 

But note: we cannot have conflicts? 

Let me try to form? 

We have to assign each letter to a unique position? 

For example, let's try N at position 2? 

Then:
   N at2? 

Then A can be at4 or at5? 

Suppose A at5? 

Then O can be at4? 

Then R must be at either 1 or 3? 

Suppose R at1? 

Then O at4? 

Then the fifth letter X must be at position3? 

So positions: 
  1: R?
  2: N
  3: X 
  4: O
  5: A? 

But note: we have O at4? and A at5? 

So the word would be R, N, X, O, A? 

But what is X? 

Then the word looks like RNXO A? 

But this must be a valid English word? 

For example, if X is T, then ""R_not""? wait RNTOA? That doesn't sound right? 

If X is S, then ""RNOSA""? Not a word? 

Alternatively, consider A at4? Then O cannot be at4? Oh wait: O can be at4? Unless we assign O to some other place? 

But if A is at4, then O could be at position2? But we put N at2? no? 

We have N at2? Then A cannot be at2? so either at4 or5? 

If we set A at4? Then O can be at1 or5? 

Then R must be at1 or3 or5? but if R at1? then O cannot be at1? 

Suppose:
   Position1: R? 
   Position2: N? 
   Position3: available? for R? but R is already at1? Or for O? but O is not at3? cannot? 
   Actually: O cannot be at3? 

If position3: must be R? or the unknown? 

But R can be at3? 

Then:
   Position1: ? 
   Position2: N? 
   Position3: R? 
   Position4: A? 
   Position5: ? 

But then O must go somewhere? Positions available: position1 and position5? 

So if position1: O? then position5: must be the fifth letter? 

So word: O N R A? and fifth letter? 

So O, N, R, A, and X? 

Word: ON_R_A? 

If the fifth letter is at position5? Then O at1? N at2? R at3? A at4? and X at5? -> ""ONRAP""? Not a word? But ""on ram""? no? 

Alternatively, O at position5? Then:
   Positions: 
      1: ?
      2: N
      3: R
      4: A
      5: O

Then word: X, N, R, A, O? -> like ""NRA?O"" -> but what word fits? 

Also, note: O cannot be at3? But we are not putting O at3? 

So a word like ""ANORA""? Wait, but A at position4? and we have to put O at5? but the word ""ANORA"" has A at the start? 

Not matching? 

Alternatively, consider N at position1? 

Then:
   N at1? 
   Then A? must be at2,4,5? 
      Suppose A at2? 
   Then R? must be at3 or5? 
   O? must be at positions? But position3: O cannot be? So if O at4? 
   Then R must be at5? 
   Then position3: must be the fifth letter? 
   Word: N A X O R? -> examples: ""NAVOR""? Not common? 

If A at position4? 
   Then O might be at position2? 
   N at1? 
   Then position2: O? 
   Then R must be at3 or5? 
      If R at3? then position5: fifth letter? 
      Word: N O R A? and fifth letter at position5? -> ""NORA_"" 
      If fifth letter is M? ""NORAM""? Not a word? 

If R at5? then word: N O? at position2? position3: must be the fifth letter? and R at5? 
   So N, O, X, A, R? -> ""NOXAR""? Not a word? 

Another possibility: N at position3? 

Given constraints: N can be at position3? 

Then:
   A must be at position2,4,or5? 
   R must be at position1,3,or5? but position3 is N? so R cannot at3? so positions1 or5? 
   O at positions 1,2,4,5? but cannot at3? 

For example:
   N at3? 
   A at2? 
   R at1? 
   Then O? at4 or5? 
   And fifth letter: the remaining? 

But position1: R? 
   position2: A? 
   position3: N? 
   position4: O? 
   position5: X? 
   -> WORD: R A N O X? 

That looks promising? ""RANOX""? Is that a word? Not common?  

Alternatively, set O at5? then X at4? 
   R A N X O? 

What words have R, A, N, O and one other letter? 

Common words: 
   ""ROBAN"" - not common? 
   ""RAN?O""?? 
   ""ORANG"" - having O, R, A, N, G? But G not eliminated? 

Yes: G is possible? 

Because we eliminated only C, E, D? 

So G is available? 

Let me think: 

Possible fifth letters? 

We know not C, E, D? 

But the word could contain G, F, B, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

Therefore, we need a valid word? 

Among the possible placements? 

What common word has R, A, N, O and one other letter? 

Examples: 
   ""ORANG"" (archaic or old term? But it's valid in some contexts? But let's see)

   ""ORANG"" is not standard? 

   But ""organ"" is a word? ""ORGAN"" -> letters: O, R, G, A, N? 

   Yes: O, R, G, A, N? 

   Does this satisfy positions? 

   Now, constraints:

   For ""ORGAN"": 
        Position1: O? 
        Position2: R? 
        Position3: G? 
        Position4: A? 
        Position5: N? 

   Now check constraints:

   - O must not be at position3? 
        Here O is at position1? okay? 
   - R must not be at position2? 
        Here R is at position2? 
        But from first guess: R not at position2? 
        Also from second guess: R not at position4? 
        But if R is at position2? that is exactly the position we know it must avoid? 

   Therefore: cannot? 

   So ""organ"" would have R at2? which is forbidden? 

   Other words: ""ROANS""? R, O, A, N, S? meaning to murmur? 

   But then positions must be: 
        We need to assign? 

   Let's try to assign R to position1? O to position2? etc? 

   But R is forbidden at2? O can be at2? 

   For example: word ""ROANS"" would have R at1? O at2? A at3? N at4? S at5? 

   Check A: A must not be at position3? 
        Here A at3? but we know A must not be at position3? 

   Therefore, invalid? 

   ""O?RAN"" 

   Another word: ""ARNOLD""? but 6 letters? we need five? 

   ""ARNON""? not a word? 

   ""TORAN"": T, O, R, A, N? 

   Word? Yes, a noun meaning a ceremonial gateway? 

   But does that satisfy positions? 

   For ""toran"": 
        Position1: T? 
        Position2: O? 
        Position3: R? 
        Position4: A? 
        Position5: N? 

   Now constraints:
      R must not be at position2 or4? 
          Here R at position3? which is allowed? 
      A must not be at position1 or3? 
          Here A at4? no problem? 
      N must not be at position4 or5? 
          Here N at5? forbidden? Because from second guess, N not at5? 

   Constraint: N cannot be at position5? 

   So ""toran"" fails because N is at5? 

   Let's try ""RANSO""?? not a word? 

   ""PROAN""?? 

   Alternatively, consider A at position5? 

   Then possible word: ...A at the end? 

   Example: ""ORNA"" is four letters? So we need a word with five? 

   ""MANOR"": M, A, N, O, R? 
        Letters: we have M? which is new? 

   Check ""manor"": 
        Position1: M? 
        Position2: A? 
        Position3: N? 
        Position4: O? 
        Position5: R? 

   Constraints:
      A must not be at position3? -> in ""manor"", A is at2? allowed? 
      But also A must not be at position1? Here at2, not position1? so okay? 
      R must not be at2 or4? 
          Here R at5? okay? 
      N must not be at4 or5? 
          N at3? okay? 
      O must not be at3? 
          O at4? not at3? so okay? 

   Except: we haven't used position constraints for M? 

   So ""manor"" meets all? 

   Let me verify each:

   - Position1: M (new letter) -> okay? 
   - Position2: A -> okay? 
   - Position3: N -> okay? 
   - Position4: O -> okay? 
   - Position5: R -> okay? 

   But wait: in the first guess, position3 was A? and we got '-'? meaning A is in the word but not at position3? Now we put N at position3? 

   And we haven't guessed N at position3? We only know N not at4 and not at5? 

   So placing at3 is new? 

   Similarly, other positions are new? 

   Therefore, ""manor"" is a valid candidate? 

   Also, letters: M, A, N, O, R? All new? But we know R, A, N, O are present? and M is the fifth letter? not eliminated? 

   So let me use ""manor"" as the guess? 

   But also, common words: ""roans""? We already saw? might not work? 

   Alternative: ""arson"": A, R, S, O, N? 
        Check positions: 
           We can assign: 
               1: A? but A must not be at1? -> rejected? 

   Or ""ranom""?? not a word? 

   ""Moran""? No? 

   I think ""manor"" is a word? 

   What about ""nairu""?? Not a word? 

   Another candidate: ""narco"" -> N, A, R, C, O? 
        But C is eliminated? from first guess! 

   We must avoid C? 

   So C not allowed? 

   Therefore, ""manor"" seems good? 

   Also, let me think of more constraints? 

   We also know from feedback:

   In guess2: 
        At position3: O -> we got '-'? 
        This new guess has at position3: N? 

        At position1: A in guess2 got '-'? 
        Now we put M at1? 

   We are testing new? 

   So? 

   Therefore, I'll go with ""manor"". 

   But what if the fifth letter is S? 

   For example: ""rosna""?? not a word? 

   ""anros""?? 

   ""sanro""?? 

   Instead, ""saron"" -> S, A, R, O, N? 

   Position constraints? 
        Assign? 
          A cannot be at1 or3? So if we put A at2? 
          Then positions: 
              1: S? 
              2: A? 
              3: R? 
              4: O? 
              5: N? 

   Check:
      R at position3? which is allowed? (because cannot be at2 or4? 3 is new) 
      But N at5? forbidden? from knowing N not at5? 

   So skip? 

   Or if we put N at2? 
        But then A must be at4 or5? 
        At position2: N? okay? (N can be at2? since not at4 or5) 
        At position1: S? 
        Then A say at4? 
        Then O at5? 
        Then R at3? 
        Word: S N R A O? 

   Then R at3? allowed? 
   But O at5? allowed? 
   N at2? allowed? 
   A at4? allowed? 

   Constraints:
        R at3: not forbidden because we only know not at2 or4? 
        N: at2? which is allowed? 
        A: at4? allowed? 
        O: at5? allowed? (O has no constraint at5) 
        S: new letter? 

   But then the word is ""SNRAO""? Not a word? 

   Therefore, ""manor"" seems a better candidate? 

   So guessed word: manor

   Format: <guess>manor</guess>

   But let me double-check if there's a common word? 

   Another word: ""robin""? But includes I? and B? 
        R,O,B,I,N -> no A? not? 

   We must include A? 

   Because A is confirmed? 

   Actually, words without A are not acceptable? 

   So ""manor"" includes A? 

   Conclusion: ""manor""

   But also, we can try ""ranks"" but we already have this? 

   Wait: ""ranks"" was considered earlier? 

   Now, with our current constraints? 

   For ""ranks"": 
        R at1? 
        A at2? 
        N at3? 
        K at4? 
        S at5? 

   Constraints:
      R: at1? which is allowed? 
      A: at2? must not be at1 or3 -> allowed? 
      N: at3? must not be at4 or5 -> allowed? 
      But O? where is O? ""ranks"" has no O? 

   But we know O is in the word? So ""ranks"" cannot be the secret word? 

   Similarly, we need O? 

   Therefore, our guess must include O? 

   So ""manor"" has O? 

   Another word: ""ano?r?"" 

   I think ""manor"" is the best? 

   So let's guess: manor
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from both guesses, here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Constraints from Feedback**:
   - From ""crane"":
     - C and E are not in the word.
     - R, A, and N are present but incorrectly positioned:
       - R not at position 2
       - A not at position 3
       - N not at position 4
   - From ""adorn"":
     - D is not in the word.
     - A is present but not at position 1.
     - O is present (newly confirmed) and not at position 3.
     - R is present but not at position 4.
     - N is present but not at position 5.

2. **Known Letters**:
   - Confirmed letters in the secret word: **R, A, N, O** (all must appear).
   - Eliminated letters: C, E, D.

3. **Positional Constraints**:
   - **A**: Cannot be at position 1 (from ""adorn"") or 3 (from ""crane""). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
   - **R**: Cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"") or 4 (from ""adorn""). Possible positions: 1, 3, or 5.
   - **N**: Cannot be at position 4 (from ""crane"") or 5 (from ""adorn""). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.
   - **O**: Cannot be at position 3 (from ""adorn""). Possible positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

4. **Unknown Fifth Letter Requirement**:
   - The word must be 5 letters with **R, A, N, O** and one unknown letter (not C, E, or D).
   - This unknown letter must fit valid English words.

5. **Generating a Valid Guess**:
   - Prioritize placing all known letters in new, untested positions that align with constraints:
     - Test A at position 2 or 4 (avoiding 1 and 3).
     - Test R at position 1 or 5 (avoiding 2 and 4).
     - Test N at position 1 or 3 (avoiding 4 and 5).
     - Test O at position 4 or 5 (avoiding 3).
   - After evaluating potential words, **""manor""** fits all constraints:
     - **M (unknown) at 1**, A at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5.
     - Positional checks:
       - M: New letter, unconstrained.
       - A: Position 2 is allowed (not 1 or 3).
       - N: Position 3 is allowed (not 4 or 5).
       - O: Position 4 is allowed (not 3).
       - R: Position 5 is allowed (not 2 or 4).
     - ""Manor"" is a valid English word that efficiently tests new positions while introducing a common consonant (M) to probe the secret word.

<guess>manor</guess>",manor,"We have feedback from two guesses:

**First Guess: crane**
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position) -> R is in the word but not at position 2
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> A is in the word but not at position 3
- N: - (in word, wrong position) -> N is in the word but not at position 4
- E: x (not in word)

**Second Guess: adorn**
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> A is in the word but not at position 1 (since we placed it at 1 and got '-')
- D: x (not in word)
- O: - (in word, wrong position) -> O is in the word but not at position 3
- R: - (in word, wrong position) -> R is in the word but not at position 4
- N: - (in word, wrong position) -> N is in the word but not at position 5

**What we know so far:**
1. **Letters in the word:** R, A, N, O (since both '-' and must be present) and we got '-' for O in guess 2.
2. **Letters not in the word:** C, E (from guess 1), D (from guess 2).
3. **Positional constraints:**
   - R cannot be at: position 2 (from guess 1), position 4 (from guess 2)
   - A cannot be at: position 3 (from guess 1), position 1 (from guess 2)
   - N cannot be at: position 4 (from guess 1), position 5 (from guess 2)
   - O cannot be at: position 3 (from guess 2)

Since we have 5 letters in the word: R, A, N, O, and one more letter? Wait: we don't know the fifth letter yet. The word is 5 letters, and we have 4 confirmed: R, A, N, O. So we need to find the fifth letter.

But note: in guess 1, we had 5 letters (crane) and three were present: R, A, N. In guess 2, we used A, D, O, R, N and got A, O, R, N present (D absent). So the word has exactly R, A, N, O and one more letter that we haven't fully identified? Yet we have feedback only on the letters guessed? So we know:

The secret word has: 
- R, A, N (from first guess) 
- and O (from second guess) 
- and one more unknown letter? 

But wait: the word is 5 letters? So if R, A, N, O are already four, we must have one more? 

However, it's possible that a letter appears twice? But we haven't guessed any duplicated letters? So currently, we think the word has four distinct known letters plus one unknown? 

But note: in guess 1, we did not guess O? So it wasn't revealed? Then in guess 2, we guessed O? and got '-'? so it is in the word? 

Therefore, the word contains R, A, N, O and one other letter? 

Also, we know that:

- The fifth letter is not C, E, D? (since they are eliminated).

**Constraints on positions:**
- A cannot be at: position 1 or 3? but we don't know? 
   Actually: 
      A is not at position 3 (from guess 1) 
      A is not at position 1 (from guess 2) 
   So A cannot be at position 1 or 3? 

- R cannot be at position 2 or 4?
- N cannot be at position 4 or 5?
- O cannot be at position 3?

Therefore, possible positions for each known letter:

For A: 
   Positions available: 2, 4, 5? 
   Because it cannot be at 1 or 3? 

Similarly, for R:
   Cannot be at 2 or 4 -> possible positions: 1, 3, 5? 

For N:
   Cannot be at 4 or 5 -> possible positions: 1, 2, 3? 

For O:
   Cannot be at 3 -> possible positions: 1, 2, 4, 5? 

But note: we have a fifth letter? which must be in the word? and must fit in the positions not occupied by R,A,N,O? 

However, we don't know what the fifth letter is? 

So we need to make a guess that includes R, A, N, O and one more letter that is not C, E, D? 

Moreover, we must place these five letters? 

But note: we have two guesses? so we have tried 2? and have 4 left? 

We also have constraints on positions? 

Let me form possible placements:

Known constraints:

The word must have exactly five letters: R, A, N, O, and one more? 

We need to consider possibilities? 

First, look for a word that uses R, A, N, O and one other letter? 

Since the fifth letter is unknown? we can try to guess? 

But we try to choose a word that can help us? 

We must avoid putting letters in positions we know they cannot be? 

So we have to assign:

- R must be at positions 1, 3, or 5? 
- A must be at positions 2, 4, or 5? 
- N must be at positions 1, 2, or 3? 
- O must be at positions 1, 2, 4, or 5? 

Now, we also have the fifth letter? that we'll call X? It's one letter? that we don't know? and must appear in the position of the remaining? 

We need a valid word? 

We list possible positions:

Position 1: R or N or O? (because R can be at1, N at1, O at1)? 

Also, position 1 could be the unknown X? 

Similarly? 

But note: we cannot have conflicts? 

Let me try to form? 

We have to assign each letter to a unique position? 

For example, let's try N at position 2? 

Then:
   N at2? 

Then A can be at4 or at5? 

Suppose A at5? 

Then O can be at4? 

Then R must be at either 1 or 3? 

Suppose R at1? 

Then O at4? 

Then the fifth letter X must be at position3? 

So positions: 
  1: R?
  2: N
  3: X 
  4: O
  5: A? 

But note: we have O at4? and A at5? 

So the word would be R, N, X, O, A? 

But what is X? 

Then the word looks like RNXO A? 

But this must be a valid English word? 

For example, if X is T, then ""R_not""? wait RNTOA? That doesn't sound right? 

If X is S, then ""RNOSA""? Not a word? 

Alternatively, consider A at4? Then O cannot be at4? Oh wait: O can be at4? Unless we assign O to some other place? 

But if A is at4, then O could be at position2? But we put N at2? no? 

We have N at2? Then A cannot be at2? so either at4 or5? 

If we set A at4? Then O can be at1 or5? 

Then R must be at1 or3 or5? but if R at1? then O cannot be at1? 

Suppose:
   Position1: R? 
   Position2: N? 
   Position3: available? for R? but R is already at1? Or for O? but O is not at3? cannot? 
   Actually: O cannot be at3? 

If position3: must be R? or the unknown? 

But R can be at3? 

Then:
   Position1: ? 
   Position2: N? 
   Position3: R? 
   Position4: A? 
   Position5: ? 

But then O must go somewhere? Positions available: position1 and position5? 

So if position1: O? then position5: must be the fifth letter? 

So word: O N R A? and fifth letter? 

So O, N, R, A, and X? 

Word: ON_R_A? 

If the fifth letter is at position5? Then O at1? N at2? R at3? A at4? and X at5? -> ""ONRAP""? Not a word? But ""on ram""? no? 

Alternatively, O at position5? Then:
   Positions: 
      1: ?
      2: N
      3: R
      4: A
      5: O

Then word: X, N, R, A, O? -> like ""NRA?O"" -> but what word fits? 

Also, note: O cannot be at3? But we are not putting O at3? 

So a word like ""ANORA""? Wait, but A at position4? and we have to put O at5? but the word ""ANORA"" has A at the start? 

Not matching? 

Alternatively, consider N at position1? 

Then:
   N at1? 
   Then A? must be at2,4,5? 
      Suppose A at2? 
   Then R? must be at3 or5? 
   O? must be at positions? But position3: O cannot be? So if O at4? 
   Then R must be at5? 
   Then position3: must be the fifth letter? 
   Word: N A X O R? -> examples: ""NAVOR""? Not common? 

If A at position4? 
   Then O might be at position2? 
   N at1? 
   Then position2: O? 
   Then R must be at3 or5? 
      If R at3? then position5: fifth letter? 
      Word: N O R A? and fifth letter at position5? -> ""NORA_"" 
      If fifth letter is M? ""NORAM""? Not a word? 

If R at5? then word: N O? at position2? position3: must be the fifth letter? and R at5? 
   So N, O, X, A, R? -> ""NOXAR""? Not a word? 

Another possibility: N at position3? 

Given constraints: N can be at position3? 

Then:
   A must be at position2,4,or5? 
   R must be at position1,3,or5? but position3 is N? so R cannot at3? so positions1 or5? 
   O at positions 1,2,4,5? but cannot at3? 

For example:
   N at3? 
   A at2? 
   R at1? 
   Then O? at4 or5? 
   And fifth letter: the remaining? 

But position1: R? 
   position2: A? 
   position3: N? 
   position4: O? 
   position5: X? 
   -> WORD: R A N O X? 

That looks promising? ""RANOX""? Is that a word? Not common?  

Alternatively, set O at5? then X at4? 
   R A N X O? 

What words have R, A, N, O and one other letter? 

Common words: 
   ""ROBAN"" - not common? 
   ""RAN?O""?? 
   ""ORANG"" - having O, R, A, N, G? But G not eliminated? 

Yes: G is possible? 

Because we eliminated only C, E, D? 

So G is available? 

Let me think: 

Possible fifth letters? 

We know not C, E, D? 

But the word could contain G, F, B, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

Therefore, we need a valid word? 

Among the possible placements? 

What common word has R, A, N, O and one other letter? 

Examples: 
   ""ORANG"" (archaic or old term? But it's valid in some contexts? But let's see)

   ""ORANG"" is not standard? 

   But ""organ"" is a word? ""ORGAN"" -> letters: O, R, G, A, N? 

   Yes: O, R, G, A, N? 

   Does this satisfy positions? 

   Now, constraints:

   For ""ORGAN"": 
        Position1: O? 
        Position2: R? 
        Position3: G? 
        Position4: A? 
        Position5: N? 

   Now check constraints:

   - O must not be at position3? 
        Here O is at position1? okay? 
   - R must not be at position2? 
        Here R is at position2? 
        But from first guess: R not at position2? 
        Also from second guess: R not at position4? 
        But if R is at position2? that is exactly the position we know it must avoid? 

   Therefore: cannot? 

   So ""organ"" would have R at2? which is forbidden? 

   Other words: ""ROANS""? R, O, A, N, S? meaning to murmur? 

   But then positions must be: 
        We need to assign? 

   Let's try to assign R to position1? O to position2? etc? 

   But R is forbidden at2? O can be at2? 

   For example: word ""ROANS"" would have R at1? O at2? A at3? N at4? S at5? 

   Check A: A must not be at position3? 
        Here A at3? but we know A must not be at position3? 

   Therefore, invalid? 

   ""O?RAN"" 

   Another word: ""ARNOLD""? but 6 letters? we need five? 

   ""ARNON""? not a word? 

   ""TORAN"": T, O, R, A, N? 

   Word? Yes, a noun meaning a ceremonial gateway? 

   But does that satisfy positions? 

   For ""toran"": 
        Position1: T? 
        Position2: O? 
        Position3: R? 
        Position4: A? 
        Position5: N? 

   Now constraints:
      R must not be at position2 or4? 
          Here R at position3? which is allowed? 
      A must not be at position1 or3? 
          Here A at4? no problem? 
      N must not be at position4 or5? 
          Here N at5? forbidden? Because from second guess, N not at5? 

   Constraint: N cannot be at position5? 

   So ""toran"" fails because N is at5? 

   Let's try ""RANSO""?? not a word? 

   ""PROAN""?? 

   Alternatively, consider A at position5? 

   Then possible word: ...A at the end? 

   Example: ""ORNA"" is four letters? So we need a word with five? 

   ""MANOR"": M, A, N, O, R? 
        Letters: we have M? which is new? 

   Check ""manor"": 
        Position1: M? 
        Position2: A? 
        Position3: N? 
        Position4: O? 
        Position5: R? 

   Constraints:
      A must not be at position3? -> in ""manor"", A is at2? allowed? 
      But also A must not be at position1? Here at2, not position1? so okay? 
      R must not be at2 or4? 
          Here R at5? okay? 
      N must not be at4 or5? 
          N at3? okay? 
      O must not be at3? 
          O at4? not at3? so okay? 

   Except: we haven't used position constraints for M? 

   So ""manor"" meets all? 

   Let me verify each:

   - Position1: M (new letter) -> okay? 
   - Position2: A -> okay? 
   - Position3: N -> okay? 
   - Position4: O -> okay? 
   - Position5: R -> okay? 

   But wait: in the first guess, position3 was A? and we got '-'? meaning A is in the word but not at position3? Now we put N at position3? 

   And we haven't guessed N at position3? We only know N not at4 and not at5? 

   So placing at3 is new? 

   Similarly, other positions are new? 

   Therefore, ""manor"" is a valid candidate? 

   Also, letters: M, A, N, O, R? All new? But we know R, A, N, O are present? and M is the fifth letter? not eliminated? 

   So let me use ""manor"" as the guess? 

   But also, common words: ""roans""? We already saw? might not work? 

   Alternative: ""arson"": A, R, S, O, N? 
        Check positions: 
           We can assign: 
               1: A? but A must not be at1? -> rejected? 

   Or ""ranom""?? not a word? 

   ""Moran""? No? 

   I think ""manor"" is a word? 

   What about ""nairu""?? Not a word? 

   Another candidate: ""narco"" -> N, A, R, C, O? 
        But C is eliminated? from first guess! 

   We must avoid C? 

   So C not allowed? 

   Therefore, ""manor"" seems good? 

   Also, let me think of more constraints? 

   We also know from feedback:

   In guess2: 
        At position3: O -> we got '-'? 
        This new guess has at position3: N? 

        At position1: A in guess2 got '-'? 
        Now we put M at1? 

   We are testing new? 

   So? 

   Therefore, I'll go with ""manor"". 

   But what if the fifth letter is S? 

   For example: ""rosna""?? not a word? 

   ""anros""?? 

   ""sanro""?? 

   Instead, ""saron"" -> S, A, R, O, N? 

   Position constraints? 
        Assign? 
          A cannot be at1 or3? So if we put A at2? 
          Then positions: 
              1: S? 
              2: A? 
              3: R? 
              4: O? 
              5: N? 

   Check:
      R at position3? which is allowed? (because cannot be at2 or4? 3 is new) 
      But N at5? forbidden? from knowing N not at5? 

   So skip? 

   Or if we put N at2? 
        But then A must be at4 or5? 
        At position2: N? okay? (N can be at2? since not at4 or5) 
        At position1: S? 
        Then A say at4? 
        Then O at5? 
        Then R at3? 
        Word: S N R A O? 

   Then R at3? allowed? 
   But O at5? allowed? 
   N at2? allowed? 
   A at4? allowed? 

   Constraints:
        R at3: not forbidden because we only know not at2 or4? 
        N: at2? which is allowed? 
        A: at4? allowed? 
        O: at5? allowed? (O has no constraint at5) 
        S: new letter? 

   But then the word is ""SNRAO""? Not a word? 

   Therefore, ""manor"" seems a better candidate? 

   So guessed word: manor

   Format: <guess>manor</guess>

   But let me double-check if there's a common word? 

   Another word: ""robin""? But includes I? and B? 
        R,O,B,I,N -> no A? not? 

   We must include A? 

   Because A is confirmed? 

   Actually, words without A are not acceptable? 

   So ""manor"" includes A? 

   Conclusion: ""manor""

   But also, we can try ""ranks"" but we already have this? 

   Wait: ""ranks"" was considered earlier? 

   Now, with our current constraints? 

   For ""ranks"": 
        R at1? 
        A at2? 
        N at3? 
        K at4? 
        S at5? 

   Constraints:
      R: at1? which is allowed? 
      A: at2? must not be at1 or3 -> allowed? 
      N: at3? must not be at4 or5 -> allowed? 
      But O? where is O? ""ranks"" has no O? 

   But we know O is in the word? So ""ranks"" cannot be the secret word? 

   Similarly, we need O? 

   Therefore, our guess must include O? 

   So ""manor"" has O? 

   Another word: ""ano?r?"" 

   I think ""manor"" is the best? 

   So let's guess: manorAfter analyzing the feedback from both guesses, here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Constraints from Feedback**:
   - From ""crane"":
     - C and E are not in the word.
     - R, A, and N are present but incorrectly positioned:
       - R not at position 2
       - A not at position 3
       - N not at position 4
   - From ""adorn"":
     - D is not in the word.
     - A is present but not at position 1.
     - O is present (newly confirmed) and not at position 3.
     - R is present but not at position 4.
     - N is present but not at position 5.

2. **Known Letters**:
   - Confirmed letters in the secret word: **R, A, N, O** (all must appear).
   - Eliminated letters: C, E, D.

3. **Positional Constraints**:
   - **A**: Cannot be at position 1 (from ""adorn"") or 3 (from ""crane""). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
   - **R**: Cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"") or 4 (from ""adorn""). Possible positions: 1, 3, or 5.
   - **N**: Cannot be at position 4 (from ""crane"") or 5 (from ""adorn""). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.
   - **O**: Cannot be at position 3 (from ""adorn""). Possible positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

4. **Unknown Fifth Letter Requirement**:
   - The word must be 5 letters with **R, A, N, O** and one unknown letter (not C, E, or D).
   - This unknown letter must fit valid English words.

5. **Generating a Valid Guess**:
   - Prioritize placing all known letters in new, untested positions that align with constraints:
     - Test A at position 2 or 4 (avoiding 1 and 3).
     - Test R at position 1 or 5 (avoiding 2 and 4).
     - Test N at position 1 or 3 (avoiding 4 and 5).
     - Test O at position 4 or 5 (avoiding 3).
   - After evaluating potential words, **""manor""** fits all constraints:
     - **M (unknown) at 1**, A at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5.
     - Positional checks:
       - M: New letter, unconstrained.
       - A: Position 2 is allowed (not 1 or 3).
       - N: Position 3 is allowed (not 4 or 5).
       - O: Position 4 is allowed (not 3).
       - R: Position 5 is allowed (not 2 or 4).
     - ""Manor"" is a valid English word that efficiently tests new positions while introducing a common consonant (M) to probe the secret word.",Guess 3: manor -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
