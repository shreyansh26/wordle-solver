We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:

We are on our second guess. The first guess was ""CRANE"" and the feedback was:
  C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)

 This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word at all.

 Since these are common letters, we need to pick a word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters.

 We now know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E.

 We must choose a word with 5 new letters. Let's consider other common vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels left: I, O, U (but note that every word must have at least one vowel, probably)
 Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we have excluded five common letters, we should aim for another word with high-frequency remaining letters.

 Possible choices: words like ""SLIMY"", ""PIOUS"", ""SULKY"", but we want a word without any of the forbidden letters.

 Let's think of words that use letters not tried yet and that are common.

 Some good candidates: 
   ""BUILD"" - contains B, U, I, L, D
   ""GHOST"" - contains G, H, O, S, T
   ""LIGHT"" - contains L, I, G, H, T

 We want to maximize the chance of getting hits. Since vowels are limited, we should include at least one vowel that hasn't been tried. The available vowels are I, O, U.

 Let's choose ""GHOST"":
   G, H, O, S, T

 This uses O (a vowel) and four consonants: G, H, S, T which are fairly common.

 Alternatively, we could choose ""PILOT"" but note that P, I, L, O, T - but we haven't tried P, I, L, O, T. However, we also haven't tried S and H.

 Since ""GHOST"" uses S and T which are very common, it might be good.

 But note: if we choose ""GHOST"", we are using O and we are covering S and T which appear in many words.

 Another candidate: ""SLIPT"" (if valid) -> but not common. Instead, let's use ""SLIMP"" (not a word) or ""SLIMY"" (valid) but ""SLIMY"" has S, L, I, M, Y. We avoid GHOST because it uses O.

 Alternatively, how about ""POINT""? It uses P, O, I, N, T -> but N was already excluded? Wait, N was excluded in the first guess. So we cannot use N. Similarly, we cannot use R, A, E.

 So we must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Therefore, ""POINT"" is invalid because it has N.

 Let's try to form a word with: S, L, I, M, T? -> ""MILTS"" or ""SMILT"" but they are less common.

 Alternatively, we can use ""BOWLS"": B, O, W, L, S -> avoids the excluded letters.

 Another possibility: ""GUILT"": G, U, I, L, T -> avoids the exclusions.

 Considering coverage, we might prefer a word with two vowels. ""GUILT"" has one vowel (U and I are vowels) but two vowels actually: U and I.

 Let me check the frequency of letters in English words without C,R,A,N,E:

 According to common wordle practice, after eliminating C,R,A,N,E, the next most common letters are: L, T, O, S, I, B, D, M, P, U, G, H, Y, K.

 So we want to cover L, T, O, S, I, etc.

 We can choose ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S -> but that's five letters.

 However, we must make sure it's a valid word. ""TOILS"" is a valid word.

 Other options: ""SPOIL"", ""PIOUS"", ""QUILT"", but Q might be too rare.

 Since we have no constraints and need to maximize information, let's go with ""TOILS"" because it includes T, O, I, L, S which are top remaining letters.

 But wait, we have not tried O, I, L, S, T. So yes.

 Alternatively, we could choose ""HOIST"": H, O, I, S, T -> also good.

 Between ""TOILS"" and ""HOIST"", both are good. Let me pick ""HOIST"" to include H which is another common consonant.

 Therefore, second guess: ""HOIST""

 If we don't get any hits, we eliminate H, O, I, S, T.

 But note: the word must have vowels, and only available vowels besides O and I are U. So we might then focus on words with U.

 However, let's try HOIST.

 So the guess will be ""HOIST"".
</think>
Based on the first guess feedback, none of the letters (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word. For the second guess, I need a word with entirely new letters to maximize information. After eliminating these common letters, I'll focus on the remaining high-frequency consonants (S, T, L, H) and vowels (O, I). 

""HOIST"" is a strong choice because:
- It uses five untried letters: H, O, I, S, T.
- It includes common consonants (S, T, H) and a vowel (O, I) to increase hit potential.
- If there are no matches, it efficiently eliminates these letters, narrowing down possibilities.

Similarly, we cannot use R, A, E.\n\n So we must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n Therefore, ""POINT"" is invalid because it has N.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word with: S, L, I, M, T? -> ""MILTS"" or ""SMILT"" but they are less common.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""BOWLS"": B, O, W, L, S -> avoids the excluded letters.\n\n Another possibility: ""GUILT"": G, U, I, L, T -> avoids the exclusions.\n\n Considering coverage, we might prefer a word with two vowels. ""GUILT"" has one vowel (U and I are vowels) but two vowels actually: U and I.\n\n Let me check the frequency of letters in English words without C,R,A,N,E:\n\n According to common wordle practice, after eliminating C,R,A,N,E, the next most common letters are: L, T, O, S, I, B, D, M, P, U, G, H, Y, K.\n\n So we want to cover L, T, O, S, I, etc.\n\n We can choose ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S -> but that\'s five letters.\n\n However, we must make sure it\'s a valid word. ""TOILS"" is a valid word.\n\n Other options: ""SPOIL"", ""PIOUS"", ""QUILT"", but Q might be too rare.\n\n Since we have no constraints and need to maximize information, let\'s go with ""TOILS"" because it includes T, O, I, L, S which are top remaining letters.\n\n But wait, we have not tried O, I, L, S, T. So yes.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose ""HOIST"": H, O, I, S, T -> also good.\n\n Between ""TOILS"" and ""HOIST"", both are good. Let me pick ""HOIST"" to include H which is another common consonant.\n\n Therefore, second guess: ""HOIST""\n\n If we don\'t get any hits, we eliminate H, O, I, S, T.\n\n But note: the word must have vowels, and only available vowels besides O and I are U. So we might then focus on words with U.\n\n However, let\'s try HOIST.\n\n So the guess will be ""HOIST"".Based on the first guess feedback, none of the letters (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word. For the second guess, I need a word with entirely new letters to maximize information. After eliminating these common letters, I\'ll focus on the remaining high-frequency consonants (S, T, L, H) and vowels (O, I). \n\n""HOIST"" is a strong choice because:\n- It uses five untried letters: H, O, I, S, T.\n- It includes common consonants (S, T, H) and a vowel (O, I) to increase hit potential.\n- If there are no matches, it efficiently eliminates these letters, narrowing down possibilities.\n\n<guess>hoist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: hoist -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have two guesses so far:

Guess 1: CRANE -> all letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
Guess 2: HOIST -> H(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(x)

The feedback for HOIST shows:
- H, O, S, T are absent (so they are not in the word)
- I is present but in the wrong position.

So, from both guesses, we know the following letters are ABSENT: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, S, T.

And we know that the letter I is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (since in HOIST, I was in the 3rd position and it was marked as wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter I, but not at position 3 (if we number positions 1 to 5).

Now, the available letters that haven't been tried are:
B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And we know the word must contain I (once, because if it had two I's, the feedback might have shown one as present, but we don't know for sure, so we should consider the possibility of repeated letters, but since we haven't seen any repeats, we'll assume no repeats for now).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes the letter I (but not at position 3)
- Does not include any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, S, T.

We also want to maximize information by using common letters and covering as many new letters as possible.

Common letters from the remaining set: L, U, D, M, P, G, B, F, Y, W, etc.

We should try to include other vowels? The only vowel left that we haven't tried is U (and sometimes Y). We have I and U as vowels, and I is already in the word.

So, let's try to form a word that has I and U, and three other consonants.

Possible words:
- BUILD: but B, U, I, L, D -> but L and D are new, and we avoid the absent letters. However, I must not be in position 3? In BUILD, I is in position 3, but we know I cannot be in position 3. So BUILD is invalid because it puts I in position 3.

We must avoid having I in the 3rd position.

So, where can I be? Positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's think of words with I not in the 3rd position.

For example:
- U in the word? Let's try to include U.

Possible words:
- DUCKY? But C is absent -> no, C is out.
- LUCKY? C is out.
- PUDGY? P, U, D, G, Y -> but no I? We must have I.

We need a word that has I and preferably U.

Another idea: ""QUICK"" but Q is not very common and we have C and K? C is absent, and K is available? But C is out, so no.

""BUILT"" -> but T is absent, so no.

""GUILD"" -> G, U, I, L, D -> and I is in the 3rd position? In GUILD, I is in the 3rd position -> not allowed.

We need a word where I is not in the 3rd position.

How about ""PLUMB""? But no I.

We must have I.

Let's try ""JUMPY"" -> no I.

""JUMBO"" -> O is absent.

""FLUID"" -> F, L, U, I, D -> I is in the 4th position? Let's see: F(1), L(2), U(3), I(4), D(5). So I is in position 4 -> that's allowed.

So ""FLUID"" has I in position 4, and uses F, L, U, I, D. All these letters are new and not in the absent list.

But is ""FLUID"" a valid word? Yes.

Another possibility: ""GUILT"" -> but T is absent.

""BUILD"" and ""GUILD"" are invalid because I is in position 3.

""QUIP"" is 4 letters.

""QUIET"" -> Q, U, I, E, T -> but E and T are absent.

""QUICK"" -> C is absent.

""BLIMP"" -> B, L, I, M, P -> I is in position 3 -> invalid.

""CLAMP"" -> C is absent.

""GLIDE"" -> E is absent.

""FLUKE"" -> E is absent.

""FLUID"" seems good: F, L, U, I, D -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:I, 5:D. I is at 4, which is not 3, so allowed.

We could also consider ""MILKY"" -> M, I, L, K, Y -> I is in position 2. That's allowed. And no absent letters.

But ""MILKY"" uses M, I, L, K, Y.

Another: ""PINKY"" -> P, I, N, K, Y -> but N is absent.

""WIMPY"" -> W, I, M, P, Y -> I in position 2, and letters are new.

""BILLY"" -> I in position 2, but double L? We don't know if double letters are allowed, but we can try. However, we are trying to avoid repeats for information.

But in ""BILLY"", L is repeated, so we get less information. So better to avoid.

Similarly, ""DILLY"" same issue.

So non-repeating letters are better.

""FLUID"" and ""MILKY"" are both good.

But ""FLUID"" has the vowel U, which might be useful.

We also have Y, which can be a vowel.

But let's compare the letter frequencies to cover more common ones.

Remaining common letters: L, U, D, M, P, G, B, F, Y, W, K, etc.

""FLUID"" covers F, L, U, I, D -> I is already known to be present, so we are testing F, L, U, D.

""MILKY"" covers M, I, L, K, Y -> testing M, L, K, Y.

Both cover L, which is common.

But ""FLUID"" covers U and D, while ""MILKY"" covers M, K, Y.

U is a vowel and might be more common than K or Y? In 5-letter words, it's hard to say.

We could also consider ""PUDGY"" but no I.

We must have I.

Another word: ""BUYIN"" - not a common word.

""GUIDE"" -> E is absent.

""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> but A is absent.

""SOLID"" -> S and O are absent.

""FLUID"" seems a solid choice.

But let's see if there's a word that includes more common consonants.

Another idea: ""BLUFF"" -> double F, not good.

""PLUMB"" -> no I.

""JUICE"" -> C and E absent.

So, I think ""FLUID"" is a good choice.

But note: in ""FLUID"", we are putting I in position 4. Since we know I is in the word but not in position 3, it could be in 1,2,4,5.

We are testing position 4 for I. If it's correct, we get a green I. If not, we know I is in 1,2, or 5.

Alternatively, we could put I in a different position to test.

For example, we could use a word with I in position 1: like ""IMPEL"" -> but E is absent.

""ITCHY"" -> I, T, C, H, Y -> T, C, H are absent.

""IMAGE"" -> A and E absent.

""IDIOM"" -> I in position 1 and 3? But we don't want repeats and position 3 is forbidden for I? Actually, we don't know if I can be in position 3? No, we know I is not in position 3 because in HOIST, I was in position 3 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning that position is wrong but the letter is in the word elsewhere. So I cannot be in position 3.

In ""IDIOM"", if we put I in position 1 and 3, but position 3 is not allowed, so it would be invalid? Actually, the word can have I in multiple positions? But we don't know. However, to be safe, we can avoid putting I in position 3.

But in ""IDIOM"", if we use it, we have I in position 1 and 3. But position 3 is not allowed for I, so the feedback would show the first I as ? and the second I as absent? But we don't know. It's messy.

Better to avoid words that put I in position 3.

So for position 1: hard to find words without absent letters.

""LILAC"" -> A and C absent.

""VIGIL"" -> I in position 2 and 5? V, I, G, I, L -> but G and L are new. However, we have two I's. But let's see: positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:G, 4:I, 5:L. We know I cannot be in position 3? But here I is in 2 and 4. Position 3 is G, which is fine. But we have two I's. We don't know if the word has two I's. But for information, it might be less efficient.

Similarly, ""FLUID"" is simpler.

Position 5: words ending with I? Like ""TAXI"" -> too short, or ""RADII"" not common.

""MANGO"" -> absent letters.

So, I think ""FLUID"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""MUCKY"" -> M, U, C, K, Y -> but C is absent.

No.

""DUVET"" -> D, U, V, E, T -> E and T absent.

So, I'll go with ""FLUID"".

But let's confirm the letters: F, L, U, I, D.

All are not in the absent list: absent are C,R,A,N,E,H,O,S,T.

So F, L, U, I, D are all new.

And I is in position 4, which is not 3, so it's allowed.

Therefore, we guess ""FLUID"".

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.
- **Guess 2: HOIST** → H, O, S, T are absent (x), and I is present but in the wrong position (-). This confirms:
  - The secret word contains the letter **I**, but not in position 3.
  - The absent letters are now: **C, R, A, N, E, H, O, S, T**.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word **must include I** (at least once), but I cannot be in position 3 (it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- All other letters from the absent list (C, R, A, N, E, H, O, S, T) are excluded.
- Available letters to use (not yet tested): **B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.
- Strategy for the next guess:
  - Include **I** in a position other than 3 (e.g., position 1, 2, 4, or 5) to test its correct location.
  - Use other high-frequency remaining letters (e.g., L, U, D, M, P) to maximize information gain.
  - Avoid repeating letters and absent letters.
  - Prioritize words with vowels (like U or Y) since every word needs vowels, and only U and Y remain as untested vowels (besides I).

### Chosen Guess: FLUID
- **F L U I D** (I is in position 4, which is allowed).
- **Why this word?**
  - Contains **I** in position 4 (testing a new position for I).
  - Uses new, common letters: **F, L, U, D** (all untested and high-frequency).
  - Includes **U** (a vowel), which increases the chance of hitting a required vowel.
  - Avoids all absent letters and repeats.
  - If I is correct in position 4, we get a ""✓"". If not, we learn if I is in position 1, 2, or 5, or if other letters (F, L, U, D) are present/absent.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on our second guess. The first guess was ""CRANE"" and the feedback was:
  C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)

 This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word at all.

 Since these are common letters, we need to pick a word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters.

 We now know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E.

 We must choose a word with 5 new letters. Let's consider other common vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels left: I, O, U (but note that every word must have at least one vowel, probably)
 Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we have excluded five common letters, we should aim for another word with high-frequency remaining letters.

 Possible choices: words like ""SLIMY"", ""PIOUS"", ""SULKY"", but we want a word without any of the forbidden letters.

 Let's think of words that use letters not tried yet and that are common.

 Some good candidates: 
   ""BUILD"" - contains B, U, I, L, D
   ""GHOST"" - contains G, H, O, S, T
   ""LIGHT"" - contains L, I, G, H, T

 We want to maximize the chance of getting hits. Since vowels are limited, we should include at least one vowel that hasn't been tried. The available vowels are I, O, U.

 Let's choose ""GHOST"":
   G, H, O, S, T

 This uses O (a vowel) and four consonants: G, H, S, T which are fairly common.

 Alternatively, we could choose ""PILOT"" but note that P, I, L, O, T - but we haven't tried P, I, L, O, T. However, we also haven't tried S and H.

 Since ""GHOST"" uses S and T which are very common, it might be good.

 But note: if we choose ""GHOST"", we are using O and we are covering S and T which appear in many words.

 Another candidate: ""SLIPT"" (if valid) -> but not common. Instead, let's use ""SLIMP"" (not a word) or ""SLIMY"" (valid) but ""SLIMY"" has S, L, I, M, Y. We avoid GHOST because it uses O.

 Alternatively, how about ""POINT""? It uses P, O, I, N, T -> but N was already excluded? Wait, N was excluded in the first guess. So we cannot use N. Similarly, we cannot use R, A, E.

 So we must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Therefore, ""POINT"" is invalid because it has N.

 Let's try to form a word with: S, L, I, M, T? -> ""MILTS"" or ""SMILT"" but they are less common.

 Alternatively, we can use ""BOWLS"": B, O, W, L, S -> avoids the excluded letters.

 Another possibility: ""GUILT"": G, U, I, L, T -> avoids the exclusions.

 Considering coverage, we might prefer a word with two vowels. ""GUILT"" has one vowel (U and I are vowels) but two vowels actually: U and I.

 Let me check the frequency of letters in English words without C,R,A,N,E:

 According to common wordle practice, after eliminating C,R,A,N,E, the next most common letters are: L, T, O, S, I, B, D, M, P, U, G, H, Y, K.

 So we want to cover L, T, O, S, I, etc.

 We can choose ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S -> but that's five letters.

 However, we must make sure it's a valid word. ""TOILS"" is a valid word.

 Other options: ""SPOIL"", ""PIOUS"", ""QUILT"", but Q might be too rare.

 Since we have no constraints and need to maximize information, let's go with ""TOILS"" because it includes T, O, I, L, S which are top remaining letters.

 But wait, we have not tried O, I, L, S, T. So yes.

 Alternatively, we could choose ""HOIST"": H, O, I, S, T -> also good.

 Between ""TOILS"" and ""HOIST"", both are good. Let me pick ""HOIST"" to include H which is another common consonant.

 Therefore, second guess: ""HOIST""

 If we don't get any hits, we eliminate H, O, I, S, T.

 But note: the word must have vowels, and only available vowels besides O and I are U. So we might then focus on words with U.

 However, let's try HOIST.

 So the guess will be ""HOIST"".Based on the first guess feedback, none of the letters (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word. For the second guess, I need a word with entirely new letters to maximize information. After eliminating these common letters, I'll focus on the remaining high-frequency consonants (S, T, L, H) and vowels (O, I). 

""HOIST"" is a strong choice because:
- It uses five untried letters: H, O, I, S, T.
- It includes common consonants (S, T, H) and a vowel (O, I) to increase hit potential.
- If there are no matches, it efficiently eliminates these letters, narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>hoist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: hoist -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses so far:

Guess 1: CRANE -> all letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
Guess 2: HOIST -> H(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(x)

The feedback for HOIST shows:
- H, O, S, T are absent (so they are not in the word)
- I is present but in the wrong position.

So, from both guesses, we know the following letters are ABSENT: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, S, T.

And we know that the letter I is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (since in HOIST, I was in the 3rd position and it was marked as wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter I, but not at position 3 (if we number positions 1 to 5).

Now, the available letters that haven't been tried are:
B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And we know the word must contain I (once, because if it had two I's, the feedback might have shown one as present, but we don't know for sure, so we should consider the possibility of repeated letters, but since we haven't seen any repeats, we'll assume no repeats for now).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes the letter I (but not at position 3)
- Does not include any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, S, T.

We also want to maximize information by using common letters and covering as many new letters as possible.

Common letters from the remaining set: L, U, D, M, P, G, B, F, Y, W, etc.

We should try to include other vowels? The only vowel left that we haven't tried is U (and sometimes Y). We have I and U as vowels, and I is already in the word.

So, let's try to form a word that has I and U, and three other consonants.

Possible words:
- BUILD: but B, U, I, L, D -> but L and D are new, and we avoid the absent letters. However, I must not be in position 3? In BUILD, I is in position 3, but we know I cannot be in position 3. So BUILD is invalid because it puts I in position 3.

We must avoid having I in the 3rd position.

So, where can I be? Positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's think of words with I not in the 3rd position.

For example:
- U in the word? Let's try to include U.

Possible words:
- DUCKY? But C is absent -> no, C is out.
- LUCKY? C is out.
- PUDGY? P, U, D, G, Y -> but no I? We must have I.

We need a word that has I and preferably U.

Another idea: ""QUICK"" but Q is not very common and we have C and K? C is absent, and K is available? But C is out, so no.

""BUILT"" -> but T is absent, so no.

""GUILD"" -> G, U, I, L, D -> and I is in the 3rd position? In GUILD, I is in the 3rd position -> not allowed.

We need a word where I is not in the 3rd position.

How about ""PLUMB""? But no I.

We must have I.

Let's try ""JUMPY"" -> no I.

""JUMBO"" -> O is absent.

""FLUID"" -> F, L, U, I, D -> I is in the 4th position? Let's see: F(1), L(2), U(3), I(4), D(5). So I is in position 4 -> that's allowed.

So ""FLUID"" has I in position 4, and uses F, L, U, I, D. All these letters are new and not in the absent list.

But is ""FLUID"" a valid word? Yes.

Another possibility: ""GUILT"" -> but T is absent.

""BUILD"" and ""GUILD"" are invalid because I is in position 3.

""QUIP"" is 4 letters.

""QUIET"" -> Q, U, I, E, T -> but E and T are absent.

""QUICK"" -> C is absent.

""BLIMP"" -> B, L, I, M, P -> I is in position 3 -> invalid.

""CLAMP"" -> C is absent.

""GLIDE"" -> E is absent.

""FLUKE"" -> E is absent.

""FLUID"" seems good: F, L, U, I, D -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:I, 5:D. I is at 4, which is not 3, so allowed.

We could also consider ""MILKY"" -> M, I, L, K, Y -> I is in position 2. That's allowed. And no absent letters.

But ""MILKY"" uses M, I, L, K, Y.

Another: ""PINKY"" -> P, I, N, K, Y -> but N is absent.

""WIMPY"" -> W, I, M, P, Y -> I in position 2, and letters are new.

""BILLY"" -> I in position 2, but double L? We don't know if double letters are allowed, but we can try. However, we are trying to avoid repeats for information.

But in ""BILLY"", L is repeated, so we get less information. So better to avoid.

Similarly, ""DILLY"" same issue.

So non-repeating letters are better.

""FLUID"" and ""MILKY"" are both good.

But ""FLUID"" has the vowel U, which might be useful.

We also have Y, which can be a vowel.

But let's compare the letter frequencies to cover more common ones.

Remaining common letters: L, U, D, M, P, G, B, F, Y, W, K, etc.

""FLUID"" covers F, L, U, I, D -> I is already known to be present, so we are testing F, L, U, D.

""MILKY"" covers M, I, L, K, Y -> testing M, L, K, Y.

Both cover L, which is common.

But ""FLUID"" covers U and D, while ""MILKY"" covers M, K, Y.

U is a vowel and might be more common than K or Y? In 5-letter words, it's hard to say.

We could also consider ""PUDGY"" but no I.

We must have I.

Another word: ""BUYIN"" - not a common word.

""GUIDE"" -> E is absent.

""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> but A is absent.

""SOLID"" -> S and O are absent.

""FLUID"" seems a solid choice.

But let's see if there's a word that includes more common consonants.

Another idea: ""BLUFF"" -> double F, not good.

""PLUMB"" -> no I.

""JUICE"" -> C and E absent.

So, I think ""FLUID"" is a good choice.

But note: in ""FLUID"", we are putting I in position 4. Since we know I is in the word but not in position 3, it could be in 1,2,4,5.

We are testing position 4 for I. If it's correct, we get a green I. If not, we know I is in 1,2, or 5.

Alternatively, we could put I in a different position to test.

For example, we could use a word with I in position 1: like ""IMPEL"" -> but E is absent.

""ITCHY"" -> I, T, C, H, Y -> T, C, H are absent.

""IMAGE"" -> A and E absent.

""IDIOM"" -> I in position 1 and 3? But we don't want repeats and position 3 is forbidden for I? Actually, we don't know if I can be in position 3? No, we know I is not in position 3 because in HOIST, I was in position 3 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning that position is wrong but the letter is in the word elsewhere. So I cannot be in position 3.

In ""IDIOM"", if we put I in position 1 and 3, but position 3 is not allowed, so it would be invalid? Actually, the word can have I in multiple positions? But we don't know. However, to be safe, we can avoid putting I in position 3.

But in ""IDIOM"", if we use it, we have I in position 1 and 3. But position 3 is not allowed for I, so the feedback would show the first I as ? and the second I as absent? But we don't know. It's messy.

Better to avoid words that put I in position 3.

So for position 1: hard to find words without absent letters.

""LILAC"" -> A and C absent.

""VIGIL"" -> I in position 2 and 5? V, I, G, I, L -> but G and L are new. However, we have two I's. But let's see: positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:G, 4:I, 5:L. We know I cannot be in position 3? But here I is in 2 and 4. Position 3 is G, which is fine. But we have two I's. We don't know if the word has two I's. But for information, it might be less efficient.

Similarly, ""FLUID"" is simpler.

Position 5: words ending with I? Like ""TAXI"" -> too short, or ""RADII"" not common.

""MANGO"" -> absent letters.

So, I think ""FLUID"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""MUCKY"" -> M, U, C, K, Y -> but C is absent.

No.

""DUVET"" -> D, U, V, E, T -> E and T absent.

So, I'll go with ""FLUID"".

But let's confirm the letters: F, L, U, I, D.

All are not in the absent list: absent are C,R,A,N,E,H,O,S,T.

So F, L, U, I, D are all new.

And I is in position 4, which is not 3, so it's allowed.

Therefore, we guess ""FLUID"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.
- **Guess 2: HOIST** → H, O, S, T are absent (x), and I is present but in the wrong position (-). This confirms:
  - The secret word contains the letter **I**, but not in position 3.
  - The absent letters are now: **C, R, A, N, E, H, O, S, T**.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word **must include I** (at least once), but I cannot be in position 3 (it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- All other letters from the absent list (C, R, A, N, E, H, O, S, T) are excluded.
- Available letters to use (not yet tested): **B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.
- Strategy for the next guess:
  - Include **I** in a position other than 3 (e.g., position 1, 2, 4, or 5) to test its correct location.
  - Use other high-frequency remaining letters (e.g., L, U, D, M, P) to maximize information gain.
  - Avoid repeating letters and absent letters.
  - Prioritize words with vowels (like U or Y) since every word needs vowels, and only U and Y remain as untested vowels (besides I).

### Chosen Guess: FLUID
- **F L U I D** (I is in position 4, which is allowed).
- **Why this word?**
  - Contains **I** in position 4 (testing a new position for I).
  - Uses new, common letters: **F, L, U, D** (all untested and high-frequency).
  - Includes **U** (a vowel), which increases the chance of hitting a required vowel.
  - Avoids all absent letters and repeats.
  - If I is correct in position 4, we get a ""✓"". If not, we learn if I is in position 1, 2, or 5, or if other letters (F, L, U, D) are present/absent.

So better to avoid.\n\nSimilarly, ""DILLY"" same issue.\n\nSo non-repeating letters are better.\n\n""FLUID"" and ""MILKY"" are both good.\n\nBut ""FLUID"" has the vowel U, which might be useful.\n\nWe also have Y, which can be a vowel.\n\nBut let\'s compare the letter frequencies to cover more common ones.\n\nRemaining common letters: L, U, D, M, P, G, B, F, Y, W, K, etc.\n\n""FLUID"" covers F, L, U, I, D -> I is already known to be present, so we are testing F, L, U, D.\n\n""MILKY"" covers M, I, L, K, Y -> testing M, L, K, Y.\n\nBoth cover L, which is common.\n\nBut ""FLUID"" covers U and D, while ""MILKY"" covers M, K, Y.\n\nU is a vowel and might be more common than K or Y? In 5-letter words, it\'s hard to say.\n\nWe could also consider ""PUDGY"" but no I.\n\nWe must have I.\n\nAnother word: ""BUYIN"" - not a common word.\n\n""GUIDE"" -> E is absent.\n\n""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> but A is absent.\n\n""SOLID"" -> S and O are absent.\n\n""FLUID"" seems a solid choice.\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word that includes more common consonants.\n\nAnother idea: ""BLUFF"" -> double F, not good.\n\n""PLUMB"" -> no I.\n\n""JUICE"" -> C and E absent.\n\nSo, I think ""FLUID"" is a good choice.\n\nBut note: in ""FLUID"", we are putting I in position 4. Since we know I is in the word but not in position 3, it could be in 1,2,4,5.\n\nWe are testing position 4 for I. If it\'s correct, we get a green I. If not, we know I is in 1,2, or 5.\n\nAlternatively, we could put I in a different position to test.\n\nFor example, we could use a word with I in position 1: like ""IMPEL"" -> but E is absent.\n\n""ITCHY"" -> I, T, C, H, Y -> T, C, H are absent.\n\n""IMAGE"" -> A and E absent.\n\n""IDIOM"" -> I in position 1 and 3? But we don\'t want repeats and position 3 is forbidden for I? Actually, we don\'t know if I can be in position 3? No, we know I is not in position 3 because in HOIST, I was in position 3 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning that position is wrong but the letter is in the word elsewhere. So I cannot be in position 3.\n\nIn ""IDIOM"", if we put I in position 1 and 3, but position 3 is not allowed, so it would be invalid? Actually, the word can have I in multiple positions? But we don\'t know. However, to be safe, we can avoid putting I in position 3.\n\nBut in ""IDIOM"", if we use it, we have I in position 1 and 3. But position 3 is not allowed for I, so the feedback would show the first I as ? and the second I as absent? But we don\'t know. It\'s messy.\n\nBetter to avoid words that put I in position 3.\n\nSo for position 1: hard to find words without absent letters.\n\n""LILAC"" -> A and C absent.\n\n""VIGIL"" -> I in position 2 and 5? V, I, G, I, L -> but G and L are new. However, we have two I\'s. But let\'s see: positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:G, 4:I, 5:L. We know I cannot be in position 3? But here I is in 2 and 4. Position 3 is G, which is fine. But we have two I\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two I\'s. But for information, it might be less efficient.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLUID"" is simpler.\n\nPosition 5: words ending with I? Like ""TAXI"" -> too short, or ""RADII"" not common.\n\n""MANGO"" -> absent letters.\n\nSo, I think ""FLUID"" is a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""MUCKY"" -> M, U, C, K, Y -> but C is absent.\n\nNo.\n\n""DUVET"" -> D, U, V, E, T -> E and T absent.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""FLUID"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: F, L, U, I, D.\n\nAll are not in the absent list: absent are C,R,A,N,E,H,O,S,T.\n\nSo F, L, U, I, D are all new.\n\nAnd I is in position 4, which is not 3, so it\'s allowed.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""FLUID"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.\n- **Guess 2: HOIST** → H, O, S, T are absent (x), and I is present but in the wrong position (-). This confirms:\n  - The secret word contains the letter **I**, but not in position 3.\n  - The absent letters are now: **C, R, A, N, E, H, O, S, T**.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word **must include I** (at least once), but I cannot be in position 3 (it must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n- All other letters from the absent list (C, R, A, N, E, H, O, S, T) are excluded.\n- Available letters to use (not yet tested): **B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.\n- Strategy for the next guess:\n  - Include **I** in a position other than 3 (e.g., position 1, 2, 4, or 5) to test its correct location.\n  - Use other high-frequency remaining letters (e.g., L, U, D, M, P) to maximize information gain.\n  - Avoid repeating letters and absent letters.\n  - Prioritize words with vowels (like U or Y) since every word needs vowels, and only U and Y remain as untested vowels (besides I).\n\n### Chosen Guess: FLUID\n- **F L U I D** (I is in position 4, which is allowed).\n- **Why this word?**\n  - Contains **I** in position 4 (testing a new position for I).\n  - Uses new, common letters: **F, L, U, D** (all untested and high-frequency).\n  - Includes **U** (a vowel), which increases the chance of hitting a required vowel.\n  - Avoids all absent letters and repeats.\n  - If I is correct in position 4, we get a ""✓"". If not, we learn if I is in position 1, 2, or 5, or if other letters (F, L, U, D) are present/absent.\n\n<guess>fluid</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: hoist -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: fluid -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) U(x) I(✓) D(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have three guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) → So none of these letters are in the word.
Absent from the word: C, R, A, N, E

Guess 2: hoist → H(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x) → H, O, S, T are absent. I is present but in the wrong position.
Thus, absent add: H, O, S, T → Total absent: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, S, T
And we know I is in the word, but not in position 3.

Guess 3: fluid → F(x) L(x) U(x) I(✓) D(✓)
This tells us:
- F, L, U are absent. Add to absent list: F, L, U → Now absent: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, S, T, F, L, U
- I is in the word and at position 4. That's confirmed by the ✓ at position 4 (since fluid: positions 1=F, 2=L, 3=U, 4=I, 5=D). So I is correctly placed at position 4.
- D is also correctly placed at position 5 (✓ for D in position 5).

So, the secret word has:
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: D
And does not contain letters: C,R,A,N,E,H,O,S,T,F,L,U

Now, we know the word ends with ""ID"" (positions 4 and 5).

We need to determine positions 1, 2, 3.

The remaining letters must be from the set of unused letters: B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note that the word must be an English word ending with ""ID"".

Common words ending with ""ID"": 
- _ _ I D, but we have positions: 1,2,3, then 4=I,5=D. So the word is ???ID.

We have three unknown positions: 1, 2, 3.

We need to fill in with letters from: B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We must avoid the absent letters.

List of possible letters: B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We now have:
- Position 4: I (fixed)
- Position 5: D (fixed)
- Position 1,2,3: to be filled with three letters from the available set.

And the word must be valid.

Let's think of English words ending in ""ID"" that are 5 letters and use only the available letters.

Common possibilities:
- ""VALID"": V,A,L,I,D → but A is absent (from guess1), L is absent (from guess3) → invalid.
- ""RAPID"": R,A,P,I,D → R and A absent → invalid.
- ""SOLID"": S,O,L,I,D → S, O, L absent → invalid.
- ""TIMID"": T,I,M,I,D → but T is absent. Also, I is repeated? But T is absent → invalid.
- ""HUMID"": H,U,M,I,D → H and U absent → invalid.
- ""FLUID"": already guessed, and F,L,U absent → not this.

What words are left?
Let's consider:
- ""M"" is available → ""M"" in the beginning?
  - ""MAVID""? Not a word.
  - ""MUCID""? Not common.
- ""P"" available: ""PLUMB""? Not ending with ID.
  - Words: ""PAPID""? No. ""PUPID""? No.
- ""G"": ""GUIDE""? But ends with E, and E is absent. Also not ending with ID.
  - ""GRID""? too short.

We need 5-letter words.

Perhaps: ""BRAID"": but B,R,A,I,D → R and A absent. Invalid.
""AVOID"": A and O absent.
""KID"": too short.

Another: ""BEIGE""? Not ID.

We might need to look for less common letters.

Possible words:
- ""RIGID"": R is absent -> no.
- ""VIVID"": V,I,V,I,D → but V is available. But we have two V's? And two I's? But we already know position 4 is I, and position 5 is D. So the first three letters: V, I, V? But I is at position 4, so position 2 cannot be I? Or can it? We don't know if the word has multiple I's.

But in ""VIVID"": 
  Position 1: V
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: V
  Position 4: I
  Position 5: D

But we have I at position 4. Also, if position 2 is I, that would be okay since we never tested I in position 2. And we know I is in the secret word, but it could be more than once.

However, from the feedback of guess2 (hoist), I was there but in the wrong position. In fluid, we have I at position 4 correct. We don't know about other I's.

But importantly, we must avoid absent letters. ""VIVID"" has only V and D and I. D is fixed, I is fixed, V is new. Absent letters not included? Check: V is not in absent list. So yes.

But in ""VIVID"", we would have I in position 2 as well? But in guess2, we had I at position 3 and got wrong position. But if the word has I in position 2, then that would be a correct letter in the word? Possibly. However, in guess2, when we guessed HOIST with I in position 3, and the word had I in position 2, it would show that I is present but in wrong position (which it did). And now for VIVID, if we guess V as position1, I at position2 (which might be correct or not), V at3, I at4 (correct), D at5 (correct).

But let's see if there are other words.

Another word: ""RABID"": R and A absent -> no.
""SOLID"": S and O and L absent -> no.

""TIMID"": T and M? T is absent -> no.

""PLUMB"" does not end with ID.

Perhaps ""MUID""? Not a word.

Let's list possible words that end with ""ID"", have 5 letters, and use letters only from B,G,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Examples:
- ""MAKID""? Not a word.
- ""GAZID""? No.
- ""JAPID""? No.
- ""KAPID""? No.
- ""VAPID"": V,A,P,I,D → but A is absent → no.
- ""WOVEN""? Not ID.

Another possibility: ""BUXOM""? Not ID.

We might be missing words. Let's think differently.

Instead of iterating, recall common words:
- ""VALID"" not possible.
- ""RIGID"" not possible because R/G? R absent.
- ""SOLID"" no.
- ""TIMID"" no.
- ""HUMID"" no.
- ""FLUID"" we guessed and it had F,L,U out.
-lg ""PLAIN"" not ID.

Use Y: ""PYKID""? Not a word.
""YOGID""? No.

Perhaps ""QUAID""? not common.

Another idea: ""BEGUILE"" is too long.

We have few options.

What about ""MIMID""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""GIMID""? No.

""VIZID""? No.

What about ""BIJOU""? Not ending with ID.

Perhaps we need to consider double letters or less common words.

Another common word: ""RAPID"" no.
""TEPID"": T,E,P,I,D → T and E absent → no.

""LIMID""? Not a word.

""VIRID"": V,I,R,I,D → R absent → no.

""WIMPY""? Not ID.

But we are fixed to ???ID.

Available letters: B,G,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

Perhaps:
- ""GAMID""? Not a word.
- ""JUMID""? No.
- ""KIPID""? No.
- ""PAVID"": P,A,V,I,D → A absent → no.
  ""PAVID"" is a word, but A absent → not useable.

""VEGID""? Not common.

""WEXID""? No.

Perhaps ""PYXID"": P,Y,X,I,D → is that a word? Pyxid means relating to a pyxidium, but might be too obscure.

In Wordle, words are typically common words.

Another possibility: ""BOXID""? Not a word.

""OID"" is not beginning.

Perhaps ""MOPPY"" not ID.

Let me search my memory: what about ""CANDID""? Too long and absent letters.

Another idea: ""MAIID""? Not common.

Perhaps ""DROID""? D, R, O, I, D → but D is at end? positions: D R O I D? But we have position 1: D? Then position 5:D? That could be. But ""droid"" is a word: D-R-O-I-D.

Check letters: D, R, O, I, D.

But R and O are absent (from absent list: R in guess1, O in guess2). So R and O are not allowed. Also, it has two D's? But position 5 is D, and if position 1 is D, that might be acceptable? But R and O are absent. So not possible.

Similarly, ""AVOID"" has A and O absent.

What about ""BEMUD""? Not ID.

Perhaps it's not common, but let's consider: ""DEIFY"" not ID.

We might have to consider that the first letter could be D? but at position 5 we have D. Could the word have two D's? For example, ""DAVID"": D,A,V,I,D → A absent → no.

With V: ""DAVID"" no.

""VALID"" no.

Another word: ""RANCID"" too long.

""PLACID"" too long and A absent.

This is difficult. Let's list all possible words that end with ""ID"" and use the available letters.

Available for position 1,2,3: B,G,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common words:
- ""RAPID"" : uses R (absent) -> invalid.
- ""SOLID"" : uses S,O (absent) -> invalid.
- ""TIMID"" : uses T (absent) -> invalid.
- ""VIVID"": V is available. Let's check: V,I,V,I,D -> positions 1: V, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:D. So the word ""VIVID"" uses V and I and D. It does not use any absent letter? Wait:
  - Absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,H,O,S,T,F,L,U
  - V is not in that list? So yes, V is available.
  - Also, I is allowed, and D is fixed.

Is ""VIVID"" a valid word? Yes, meaning bright or intense.

And it ends with ID.

So ""VIVID"" is a candidate. Let's confirm the positions:
- Position 1: V
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: V
- Position 4: I (correct)
- Position 5: D (correct)

We haven't used V before, so it's new.

But in this case, position 2 is I, which might be correct or not. We know the word has I, but we don't know if it has two I's. But it's possible.

Are there other words?

Another possibility: ""BIVID""? Not a word.
""PIVID""? No.

""WIVID""? No.

""VINID""? Vinid is not a common word.

""GIVID""? No.

So ""VIVID"" seems plausible.

Perhaps ""KIDVID"" too long.

Another word: ""PIXIE"" ends with E, not ID.

""MAXIM"" not ID.

""JUMBO"" not ID.

Perhaps ""MUGID""? Not common.

""YOGID"" not a word.

Even if obscure, if no common words, we might have to use ""VIVID"".

But let's check if there are others.

""PYXID"" as I thought earlier: ""PYXID"" might be considered, but not common.

In Wordle, the word list includes ""VIVID"", so it should be acceptable.

Another option: ""LIPID"": L,I,P,I,D → but L is absent (from guess3: fluid L(x)). So L is absent, not usable.

""RIGID"": R absent.

""VIGIL"" ends with L, not ID.

So ""VIVID"" appears to be the only common option.

But in ""VIVID"", we have:
- V at position 1 and 3
- I at position 2 and 4
- D at position 5

This would confirm the D at 5 and I at 4. If the word is ""VIVID"", then V at position 1 and 3 might be present.

But we need to guess this.

Is there a word with different letters?

For example, ""BRAID"" has absent letters.

""GRAPHID""? Too long.

Only 5 letters.

Perhaps ""BUPID""? Not a word.

I think ""VIVID"" is the best choice.

So we'll guess ""VIVID"".

But note: in position 2, we are guessing I. We know I is already in position 4, so if the word has only one I, then position 2 cannot be I. But if it has two I's, it could be.

In the feedback from guess2 (hoist), we had I present but wrong position. Now, in ""VIVID"", if we guess I at position 2, and the word has I only at position 4, then the feedback would mark I at position 2 as absent? But we don't know, so we might waste.

It's risky.

But what are the alternatives?

We must have a word ending with ID, with first three letters from the available set, not using absent letters.

Possible combinations:

Position 1: candidate letters - B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Position 2: same, but note it can be I? Or we avoid I to test other letters.

But we need a valid word.

List of 5-letter words ending with ""ID"": 

Common ones: rapid, solid, timid, humid, valid, vivid, etc.

From this, only ""vivid"" doesn't use any absent letter. Others do.

Less common: 
- ""fugid"" - not a common word.
- ""jugid"" - no.
- ""mucid"" - no.
- ""pavid"" - but A absent.

So ""vivid"" seems the only option.

Therefore, we guess ""VIVID"".

But let's consider: perhaps the word has ""ID"" but not necessarily double letters.

Another word: ""GEKID"" not a word.

""WEKID"" no.

So, we go with ""VIVID"".

In the context of the game, it's an acceptable guess.

So guess: ""VIVID""

But a word like ""MIMID""? Not common.

I think ""VIVID"" is the way to go.

Thus, the next guess is ""VIVID"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. This eliminates these common letters.
   - **Guess 2: HOIST** → H, O, S, T are absent, and I is present but in the wrong position (not position 3).
   - **Guess 3: FLUID** → F, L, U are absent, I is correct in position 4 (✓), and D is correct in position 5 (✓).

2. **Key Insights**:
   - **Known Letters**:
     - Position 4 must be **I** (confirmed ✓).
     - Position 5 must be **D** (confirmed ✓).
   - **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, S, T, F, L, U (all eliminated).
   - **Available Letters**: Only letters not tried or contradicted: B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word must end with **ID** (positions 4 and 5 fixed). Positions 1, 2, and 3 need to be filled with letters from the available set.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Focus on finding a valid 5-letter word ending in ""ID"" that uses only available letters.
   - Prioritize common English words while avoiding absent letters.
   - Test high-frequency remaining consonants (e.g., V, M, P) to maximize information.
   - Analyze possible words: Common ""ID""-ending words like rapid, solid, valid are invalid due to absent letters. After evaluating options, ""VIVID"" is a valid word that fits:
     - Uses V (untested) and available letters B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
     - Avoids all absent letters and respects fixed positions 4 (I) and 5 (D).
     - If ""VIVID"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal new information about V and potential double letters (e.g., if V is present).

4. **Risk Consideration**: 
   - ""VIVID"" includes I in position 2, which might conflict with the known single-I from Guess 2. However, Guess 2 only confirmed I is present (not exclusive to one instance), so duplicates are possible. If the word has only one I (in position 4), position 2's I would be marked wrong, providing critical position clues for remaining guesses.

<guess>vivid</guess>",vivid,"We have three guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) → So none of these letters are in the word.
Absent from the word: C, R, A, N, E

Guess 2: hoist → H(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x) → H, O, S, T are absent. I is present but in the wrong position.
Thus, absent add: H, O, S, T → Total absent: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, S, T
And we know I is in the word, but not in position 3.

Guess 3: fluid → F(x) L(x) U(x) I(✓) D(✓)
This tells us:
- F, L, U are absent. Add to absent list: F, L, U → Now absent: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, S, T, F, L, U
- I is in the word and at position 4. That's confirmed by the ✓ at position 4 (since fluid: positions 1=F, 2=L, 3=U, 4=I, 5=D). So I is correctly placed at position 4.
- D is also correctly placed at position 5 (✓ for D in position 5).

So, the secret word has:
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: D
And does not contain letters: C,R,A,N,E,H,O,S,T,F,L,U

Now, we know the word ends with ""ID"" (positions 4 and 5).

We need to determine positions 1, 2, 3.

The remaining letters must be from the set of unused letters: B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note that the word must be an English word ending with ""ID"".

Common words ending with ""ID"": 
- _ _ I D, but we have positions: 1,2,3, then 4=I,5=D. So the word is ???ID.

We have three unknown positions: 1, 2, 3.

We need to fill in with letters from: B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We must avoid the absent letters.

List of possible letters: B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We now have:
- Position 4: I (fixed)
- Position 5: D (fixed)
- Position 1,2,3: to be filled with three letters from the available set.

And the word must be valid.

Let's think of English words ending in ""ID"" that are 5 letters and use only the available letters.

Common possibilities:
- ""VALID"": V,A,L,I,D → but A is absent (from guess1), L is absent (from guess3) → invalid.
- ""RAPID"": R,A,P,I,D → R and A absent → invalid.
- ""SOLID"": S,O,L,I,D → S, O, L absent → invalid.
- ""TIMID"": T,I,M,I,D → but T is absent. Also, I is repeated? But T is absent → invalid.
- ""HUMID"": H,U,M,I,D → H and U absent → invalid.
- ""FLUID"": already guessed, and F,L,U absent → not this.

What words are left?
Let's consider:
- ""M"" is available → ""M"" in the beginning?
  - ""MAVID""? Not a word.
  - ""MUCID""? Not common.
- ""P"" available: ""PLUMB""? Not ending with ID.
  - Words: ""PAPID""? No. ""PUPID""? No.
- ""G"": ""GUIDE""? But ends with E, and E is absent. Also not ending with ID.
  - ""GRID""? too short.

We need 5-letter words.

Perhaps: ""BRAID"": but B,R,A,I,D → R and A absent. Invalid.
""AVOID"": A and O absent.
""KID"": too short.

Another: ""BEIGE""? Not ID.

We might need to look for less common letters.

Possible words:
- ""RIGID"": R is absent -> no.
- ""VIVID"": V,I,V,I,D → but V is available. But we have two V's? And two I's? But we already know position 4 is I, and position 5 is D. So the first three letters: V, I, V? But I is at position 4, so position 2 cannot be I? Or can it? We don't know if the word has multiple I's.

But in ""VIVID"": 
  Position 1: V
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: V
  Position 4: I
  Position 5: D

But we have I at position 4. Also, if position 2 is I, that would be okay since we never tested I in position 2. And we know I is in the secret word, but it could be more than once.

However, from the feedback of guess2 (hoist), I was there but in the wrong position. In fluid, we have I at position 4 correct. We don't know about other I's.

But importantly, we must avoid absent letters. ""VIVID"" has only V and D and I. D is fixed, I is fixed, V is new. Absent letters not included? Check: V is not in absent list. So yes.

But in ""VIVID"", we would have I in position 2 as well? But in guess2, we had I at position 3 and got wrong position. But if the word has I in position 2, then that would be a correct letter in the word? Possibly. However, in guess2, when we guessed HOIST with I in position 3, and the word had I in position 2, it would show that I is present but in wrong position (which it did). And now for VIVID, if we guess V as position1, I at position2 (which might be correct or not), V at3, I at4 (correct), D at5 (correct).

But let's see if there are other words.

Another word: ""RABID"": R and A absent -> no.
""SOLID"": S and O and L absent -> no.

""TIMID"": T and M? T is absent -> no.

""PLUMB"" does not end with ID.

Perhaps ""MUID""? Not a word.

Let's list possible words that end with ""ID"", have 5 letters, and use letters only from B,G,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Examples:
- ""MAKID""? Not a word.
- ""GAZID""? No.
- ""JAPID""? No.
- ""KAPID""? No.
- ""VAPID"": V,A,P,I,D → but A is absent → no.
- ""WOVEN""? Not ID.

Another possibility: ""BUXOM""? Not ID.

We might be missing words. Let's think differently.

Instead of iterating, recall common words:
- ""VALID"" not possible.
- ""RIGID"" not possible because R/G? R absent.
- ""SOLID"" no.
- ""TIMID"" no.
- ""HUMID"" no.
- ""FLUID"" we guessed and it had F,L,U out.
-lg ""PLAIN"" not ID.

Use Y: ""PYKID""? Not a word.
""YOGID""? No.

Perhaps ""QUAID""? not common.

Another idea: ""BEGUILE"" is too long.

We have few options.

What about ""MIMID""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""GIMID""? No.

""VIZID""? No.

What about ""BIJOU""? Not ending with ID.

Perhaps we need to consider double letters or less common words.

Another common word: ""RAPID"" no.
""TEPID"": T,E,P,I,D → T and E absent → no.

""LIMID""? Not a word.

""VIRID"": V,I,R,I,D → R absent → no.

""WIMPY""? Not ID.

But we are fixed to ???ID.

Available letters: B,G,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

Perhaps:
- ""GAMID""? Not a word.
- ""JUMID""? No.
- ""KIPID""? No.
- ""PAVID"": P,A,V,I,D → A absent → no.
  ""PAVID"" is a word, but A absent → not useable.

""VEGID""? Not common.

""WEXID""? No.

Perhaps ""PYXID"": P,Y,X,I,D → is that a word? Pyxid means relating to a pyxidium, but might be too obscure.

In Wordle, words are typically common words.

Another possibility: ""BOXID""? Not a word.

""OID"" is not beginning.

Perhaps ""MOPPY"" not ID.

Let me search my memory: what about ""CANDID""? Too long and absent letters.

Another idea: ""MAIID""? Not common.

Perhaps ""DROID""? D, R, O, I, D → but D is at end? positions: D R O I D? But we have position 1: D? Then position 5:D? That could be. But ""droid"" is a word: D-R-O-I-D.

Check letters: D, R, O, I, D.

But R and O are absent (from absent list: R in guess1, O in guess2). So R and O are not allowed. Also, it has two D's? But position 5 is D, and if position 1 is D, that might be acceptable? But R and O are absent. So not possible.

Similarly, ""AVOID"" has A and O absent.

What about ""BEMUD""? Not ID.

Perhaps it's not common, but let's consider: ""DEIFY"" not ID.

We might have to consider that the first letter could be D? but at position 5 we have D. Could the word have two D's? For example, ""DAVID"": D,A,V,I,D → A absent → no.

With V: ""DAVID"" no.

""VALID"" no.

Another word: ""RANCID"" too long.

""PLACID"" too long and A absent.

This is difficult. Let's list all possible words that end with ""ID"" and use the available letters.

Available for position 1,2,3: B,G,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common words:
- ""RAPID"" : uses R (absent) -> invalid.
- ""SOLID"" : uses S,O (absent) -> invalid.
- ""TIMID"" : uses T (absent) -> invalid.
- ""VIVID"": V is available. Let's check: V,I,V,I,D -> positions 1: V, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:D. So the word ""VIVID"" uses V and I and D. It does not use any absent letter? Wait:
  - Absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,H,O,S,T,F,L,U
  - V is not in that list? So yes, V is available.
  - Also, I is allowed, and D is fixed.

Is ""VIVID"" a valid word? Yes, meaning bright or intense.

And it ends with ID.

So ""VIVID"" is a candidate. Let's confirm the positions:
- Position 1: V
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: V
- Position 4: I (correct)
- Position 5: D (correct)

We haven't used V before, so it's new.

But in this case, position 2 is I, which might be correct or not. We know the word has I, but we don't know if it has two I's. But it's possible.

Are there other words?

Another possibility: ""BIVID""? Not a word.
""PIVID""? No.

""WIVID""? No.

""VINID""? Vinid is not a common word.

""GIVID""? No.

So ""VIVID"" seems plausible.

Perhaps ""KIDVID"" too long.

Another word: ""PIXIE"" ends with E, not ID.

""MAXIM"" not ID.

""JUMBO"" not ID.

Perhaps ""MUGID""? Not common.

""YOGID"" not a word.

Even if obscure, if no common words, we might have to use ""VIVID"".

But let's check if there are others.

""PYXID"" as I thought earlier: ""PYXID"" might be considered, but not common.

In Wordle, the word list includes ""VIVID"", so it should be acceptable.

Another option: ""LIPID"": L,I,P,I,D → but L is absent (from guess3: fluid L(x)). So L is absent, not usable.

""RIGID"": R absent.

""VIGIL"" ends with L, not ID.

So ""VIVID"" appears to be the only common option.

But in ""VIVID"", we have:
- V at position 1 and 3
- I at position 2 and 4
- D at position 5

This would confirm the D at 5 and I at 4. If the word is ""VIVID"", then V at position 1 and 3 might be present.

But we need to guess this.

Is there a word with different letters?

For example, ""BRAID"" has absent letters.

""GRAPHID""? Too long.

Only 5 letters.

Perhaps ""BUPID""? Not a word.

I think ""VIVID"" is the best choice.

So we'll guess ""VIVID"".

But note: in position 2, we are guessing I. We know I is already in position 4, so if the word has only one I, then position 2 cannot be I. But if it has two I's, it could be.

In the feedback from guess2 (hoist), we had I present but wrong position. Now, in ""VIVID"", if we guess I at position 2, and the word has I only at position 4, then the feedback would mark I at position 2 as absent? But we don't know, so we might waste.

It's risky.

But what are the alternatives?

We must have a word ending with ID, with first three letters from the available set, not using absent letters.

Possible combinations:

Position 1: candidate letters - B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Position 2: same, but note it can be I? Or we avoid I to test other letters.

But we need a valid word.

List of 5-letter words ending with ""ID"": 

Common ones: rapid, solid, timid, humid, valid, vivid, etc.

From this, only ""vivid"" doesn't use any absent letter. Others do.

Less common: 
- ""fugid"" - not a common word.
- ""jugid"" - no.
- ""mucid"" - no.
- ""pavid"" - but A absent.

So ""vivid"" seems the only option.

Therefore, we guess ""VIVID"".

But let's consider: perhaps the word has ""ID"" but not necessarily double letters.

Another word: ""GEKID"" not a word.

""WEKID"" no.

So, we go with ""VIVID"".

In the context of the game, it's an acceptable guess.

So guess: ""VIVID""

But a word like ""MIMID""? Not common.

I think ""VIVID"" is the way to go.

Thus, the next guess is ""VIVID"".### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. This eliminates these common letters.
   - **Guess 2: HOIST** → H, O, S, T are absent, and I is present but in the wrong position (not position 3).
   - **Guess 3: FLUID** → F, L, U are absent, I is correct in position 4 (✓), and D is correct in position 5 (✓).

2. **Key Insights**:
   - **Known Letters**:
     - Position 4 must be **I** (confirmed ✓).
     - Position 5 must be **D** (confirmed ✓).
   - **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, S, T, F, L, U (all eliminated).
   - **Available Letters**: Only letters not tried or contradicted: B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word must end with **ID** (positions 4 and 5 fixed). Positions 1, 2, and 3 need to be filled with letters from the available set.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Focus on finding a valid 5-letter word ending in ""ID"" that uses only available letters.
   - Prioritize common English words while avoiding absent letters.
   - Test high-frequency remaining consonants (e.g., V, M, P) to maximize information.
   - Analyze possible words: Common ""ID""-ending words like rapid, solid, valid are invalid due to absent letters. After evaluating options, ""VIVID"" is a valid word that fits:
     - Uses V (untested) and available letters B, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
     - Avoids all absent letters and respects fixed positions 4 (I) and 5 (D).
     - If ""VIVID"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal new information about V and potential double letters (e.g., if V is present).

4. **Risk Consideration**: 
   - ""VIVID"" includes I in position 2, which might conflict with the known single-I from Guess 2. However, Guess 2 only confirmed I is present (not exclusive to one instance), so duplicates are possible. If the word has only one I (in position 4), position 2's I would be marked wrong, providing critical position clues for remaining guesses.",Guess 4: vivid -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) I(✓) V(✓) I(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
