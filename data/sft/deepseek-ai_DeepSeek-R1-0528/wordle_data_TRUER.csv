We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

So we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed it there and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Has R as the second letter (since it's fixed in position).
- Includes the letter E (because it's in the word) but not in the fifth position.
- Avoids the letters C, A, and N.

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

Possible approach:
- Since R is fixed at position 2, we can try words that start with different letters to test other positions.
- We know E is in the word but not at the end, so we can try E in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let's think of words that have R as the second letter and include E, and avoid C, A, N.

Some examples:
- Try E at position 1: E _ R _ _
  - Words: ""ERECT"" (but has C and T? We know C is out, so no), ""ERUPT"" (has U, P, T), ""ERASE"" (has A and S, but A is out) -> not good.
  - Instead, how about ""EERIE""? But that has two E's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, it has I and E again.

Alternatively, try E at position 3: _ R E _ _
  - Words: ""TREND"" (but T is new, D is new; but we have R fixed and E at 3) -> but we know N is out, so ""TREND"" has N -> invalid because N is not in the word? Actually, the feedback said N is not in the word, so we cannot use N.

We must avoid C, A, N.

Let me list some words with R as second letter and E somewhere (not at position 5) and without C, A, N.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, I, D, G, U, etc.

Possible words:
- ""PRESENT"" is 6 letters, too long.
- We need 5 letters.

Try E at position 1: ""E R _ _ _""
- Options: ""ERECT"" (invalid because of C), ""ERUPT"" (E, R, U, P, T) -> valid? Let's check: E at 1, R at 2, U at 3, P at 4, T at 5. But we know E is in the word but not at position 5? Actually, we have E at position 1, which is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at position 5. However, we don't know if E can be at position 1. Also, we are trying to test new letters.

But note: the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 5. It could be at position 1, 3, or 4.

Another word: ""ERODE"" (E, R, O, D, E). This has two E's. The word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But the feedback didn't indicate duplicate, so we have to consider it possible.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Try without duplicate E.

Word: ""ERUPT"" - letters: E, R, U, P, T. None of these are C, A, N. And E is at position 1.

But we have R at position 2, which is fixed. And E at 1: if the word has E at 1, then we would get a ✓ for E? But we don't know if E is at 1. Alternatively, if E is at 3 or 4, then in ""ERUPT"" the E at 1 would be marked as x or -? Actually, if the word has only one E and it's at position 3, then the E at position 1 would be marked as x (not in the word) or - (if it were in the word but wrong position)? But the word has only one E? We don't know.

Actually, the feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and marked as - (meaning present but not at 5). So the word has at least one E. It might have more.

But to be safe, let's try a word that has E in a different position and also tests other common letters.

Another idea: put E at position 3: _ R E _ _
- Words: ""GREEK"" (has G, R, E, E, K -> two E's and K) but we don't know about duplicates. Also, we are avoiding A, C, N, so G, R, E, K are okay? But two E's: if the word has only one E, then the second E might be marked as x? But we don't mind because we are testing.

But let's think of words without duplicates: 
- ""TREES"" is 5 letters but has two E's and ends with S? Also, we don't know about S.

Better: ""TREND"" but has N -> invalid because N is not in the word (from first feedback).

Another: ""BREED"" (has B, R, E, E, D) -> two E's and B and D. But we don't know about B and D.

But we also know that the first letter is not C (because C was in the first guess and was x). So we can try B? 

Wait, the first guess had C at position 1 and it was x, so the first letter is not C. But it could be any other letter.

Let me try to list words with pattern: [not C, A, N] R [not C, A, N] [not C, A, N] [not C, A, N] and including E (but not at position 5? Actually, we can put E at position 5? No, because the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so we cannot put E at position 5 again. We must put E at 1, 3, or 4.

So positions: 
- Position 1: cannot be C, A, or N? Actually, we only know that C, A, N are not in the word at all. So we cannot use these letters anywhere.

Therefore, the entire word must not contain C, A, or N.

And we must include E (because we know it's in the word) and R at position 2.

So the word must have R at position 2 and E in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let me think of words that fit: 
- Position 1: any letter except C, A, N, and not E? We can try E at 1.
  - ""E R _ _ _"": e.g., ""ERECT"" (invalid because of C), ""ERUPT"" (E, R, U, P, T) -> valid? Yes, and U, P, T are new.
- Position 3: _ R E _ _
  - e.g., ""GREET"" (G, R, E, E, T) -> two E's, but we can try. Or ""TREES"" (T, R, E, E, S) -> two E's and S.
  - Without duplicates: ""PRESENT"" too long. ""DREGS"" (D, R, E, G, S) -> but S at the end? We don't know about S. Also, ""DREGS"" is a word? It means sediment.

But let's consider: we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Another word: ""BREAD"" (B, R, E, A, D) -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So invalid.

""BREED"" has two E's and no A, C, N: B, R, E, E, D.

""FREED"" (F, R, E, E, D) -> two E's.

""GREEN"" (G, R, E, E, N) -> has N, invalid.

""CREED"" has C, invalid.

So perhaps ""ERUPT"" is a good candidate: it uses E, R, U, P, T. All new letters except R and E (which we know are in the word). And it tests U, P, T.

But note: we are putting E at position 1. If the word has E at position 1, then we get a ✓ for E. If not, then we might get a - (if E is at 3 or 4) or even x? But we know E is in the word, so if it's not at 1, it would be marked as - (wrong position) because it's present. Actually, the feedback symbol for a letter that is in the word but not in the correct position is '-'.

So if we guess ""ERUPT"":
- If the E is at position 1 in the secret word, then E would be ✓.
- If the E is at position 3, then the E at position 1 would be marked as - (because E is in the word, but not at 1) and then we would also have the R at 2 as ✓, and then the other letters U, P, T would be checked.

But note: the secret word has exactly one E? Or more? We don't know. But if it has only one E, then if we put E at position 1 and the actual E is at position 3, then the E at 1 would be marked as - (meaning present) and then we know that the E must be at position 3? Actually, no: the - only tells us that the letter is in the word but not at that position. It doesn't tell us which position. But we can infer.

Alternatively, we can try to put E at position 3 to see if it is there.

But without more information, either is fine.

Another common word: ""ROUSE"" but R is at position 1, but we need R at position 2.

We need R at position 2.

Another word: ""WRECK"" has C? No, W, R, E, C, K -> C is invalid.

""PRESS"" (P, R, E, S, S) -> has two S's. And E at position 3.

But we don't know about S.

I think ""ERUPT"" is a reasonable guess.

But let me check if there are other words that might cover more common letters.

Another word: ""TRIED"" (T, R, I, E, D) -> E at position 4. This avoids C, A, N. Letters: T, R, I, E, D.

This also tests T, I, D.

Compared to ""ERUPT"", which tests E, R, U, P, T.

""TRIED"" has T at position 1, R at 2, I at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

We know E is not at 5, so putting E at 4 is okay.

And we test I and D.

Both are valid.

But note: in ""TRIED"", we are testing E at position 4. If the secret word has E at position 4, then we get a ✓ for E. If not, then we get a - for E (if it's at 1 or 3) and then we know it's not at 4.

Similarly, in ""ERUPT"", we test E at 1.

I think both are acceptable. Let me choose one.

I'll go with ""TRIED"" because it tests more vowels (I) and common consonants (T, D).

But we already have T in ""ERUPT"" as well? Actually, ""ERUPT"" has T at the end.

But ""TRIED"" has I, which is a vowel we haven't tried.

We haven't tried I, O, U, etc.

In the first guess, we tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so we have tried R, E, and also A (which is out) and C (out), N (out). So we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So we have many letters left.

In ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> new letters: T, I, D.

In ""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> new letters: U, P, T.

Both test T. ""TRIED"" tests I and D, ""ERUPT"" tests U and P.

I think I is more common than U and P, so ""TRIED"" might be better.

But we also know that the word has E, so we are including E again, which is necessary.

Another word: ""PRICE"" -> but has C, invalid.

""BRIDE"" (B, R, I, D, E) -> E at position 5? But we cannot put E at position 5 because the feedback said E is not at position 5. So if we put E at 5, it would be wrong and we might get a - again? But we know it's not at 5, so we should avoid position 5 for E.

In ""BRIDE"", E is at 5 -> so we should avoid that.

In ""TRIED"", E is at 4 -> okay.

In ""ERUPT"", E is at 1 -> okay.

So ""TRIED"" is acceptable.

Let me choose ""TRIED"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""TRIED"" is a valid English word.

So I'll go with ""TRIED"".

But let me see if there's a word that tests O or S.

For example: ""PROSE"" (P, R, O, S, E) -> but E at position 5 -> avoid.

""ROUSE"" (R at position 1, but we need R at position 2) -> not matching.

""FROZE"" (F, R, O, Z, E) -> E at 5 -> avoid.

""GRIME"" (G, R, I, M, E) -> E at 5 -> avoid.

So to avoid E at 5, we need to have E in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Another word: ""DRIVE"" (D, R, I, V, E) -> E at 5 -> avoid.

""TRIPE"" (T, R, I, P, E) -> E at 5 -> avoid.

So many words end with E. 

""CRIME"" has C, invalid.

""BRINE"" has N, invalid.

So ""TRIED"" with E at 4 is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""OPTER"" is not a common word.

""OILER"" (O, I, L, E, R) -> but R is at position 5, but we need R at position 2. So not.

We must have R at position 2.

So I think ""TRIED"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, I will guess ""TRIED"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, marked with ✓).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked with -).

Key insights for the next guess:
- The second letter must be R.
- E must appear in the word, but not in the fifth position (so positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible).
- The word cannot contain C, A, or N.
- To maximize information, the new guess should test common unused letters (e.g., T, I, D, S, O, L) and avoid repeating the fifth-position E.

The word ""tried"" fits these criteria:
- It has R as the second letter.
- It places E in the fourth position (avoiding the fifth position).
- It introduces new common letters: T (position 1), I (position 3), and D (position 5).
- It avoids C, A, and N.

This guess will help identify the positions of E and R while testing three new letters.

<guess>tried</guess>",tried,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

So we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed it there and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

We need to make a second guess that:

We must avoid C, A, N.

Let me list some words with R as second letter and E somewhere (not at position 5) and without C, A, N.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, I, D, G, U, etc.

Possible words:
- ""PRESENT"" is 6 letters, too long.
- We need 5 letters.

Try E at position 1: ""E R _ _ _""
- Options: ""ERECT"" (invalid because of C), ""ERUPT"" (E, R, U, P, T) -> valid? Let's check: E at 1, R at 2, U at 3, P at 4, T at 5. But we know E is in the word but not at position 5? Actually, we have E at position 1, which is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at position 5. However, we don't know if E can be at position 1. Also, we are trying to test new letters.

But note: the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 5. It could be at position 1, 3, or 4.

- Position 3: _ R E _ _

""FREED"" (F, R, E, E, D) -> two E's.

""CREED"" has C, invalid.

So perhaps ""ERUPT"" is a good candidate: it uses E, R, U, P, T. All new letters except R and E (which we know are in the word). And it tests U, P, T.

Actually, the feedback symbol for a letter that is in the word but not in the correct position is '-'.

So if we guess ""ERUPT"":
- If the E is at position 1 in the secret word, then E would be ✓.
- If the E is at position 3, then the E at position 1 would be marked as - (because E is in the word, but not at 1) and then we would also have the R at 2 as ✓, and then the other letters U, P, T would be checked.

But note: the secret word has exactly one E? Or more? We don't know. But if it has only one E, then if we put E at position 1 and the actual E is at position 3, then the E at 1 would be marked as - (meaning present) and then we know that the E must be at position 3? Actually, no: the - only tells us that the letter is in the word but not at that position. It doesn't tell us which position. But we can infer.

Alternatively, we can try to put E at position 3 to see if it is there.

But without more information, either is fine.

Another common word: ""ROUSE"" but R is at position 1, but we need R at position 2.

We need R at position 2.

Another word: ""WRECK"" has C? No, W, R, E, C, K -> C is invalid.

""PRESS"" (P, R, E, S, S) -> has two S's. And E at position 3.

But we don't know about S.

I think ""ERUPT"" is a reasonable guess.

But let me check if there are other words that might cover more common letters.

Another word: ""TRIED"" (T, R, I, E, D) -> E at position 4. This avoids C, A, N. Letters: T, R, I, E, D.

This also tests T, I, D.

Compared to ""ERUPT"", which tests E, R, U, P, T.

""TRIED"" has T at position 1, R at 2, I at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

We know E is not at 5, so putting E at 4 is okay.

And we test I and D.

Both are valid.

But note: in ""TRIED"", we are testing E at position 4. If the secret word has E at position 4, then we get a ✓ for E. If not, then we get a - for E (if it's at 1 or 3) and then we know it's not at 4.

Similarly, in ""ERUPT"", we test E at 1.

I think both are acceptable. Let me choose one.

I'll go with ""TRIED"" because it tests more vowels (I) and common consonants (T, D).

But we already have T in ""ERUPT"" as well? Actually, ""ERUPT"" has T at the end.

But ""TRIED"" has I, which is a vowel we haven't tried.

We haven't tried I, O, U, etc.

In the first guess, we tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so we have tried R, E, and also A (which is out) and C (out), N (out). So we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So we have many letters left.

In ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> new letters: T, I, D.

In ""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> new letters: U, P, T.

Both test T. ""TRIED"" tests I and D, ""ERUPT"" tests U and P.

I think I is more common than U and P, so ""TRIED"" might be better.

But we also know that the word has E, so we are including E again, which is necessary.

Another word: ""PRICE"" -> but has C, invalid.

""BRIDE"" (B, R, I, D, E) -> E at position 5? But we cannot put E at position 5 because the feedback said E is not at position 5. So if we put E at 5, it would be wrong and we might get a - again? But we know it's not at 5, so we should avoid position 5 for E.

In ""BRIDE"", E is at 5 -> so we should avoid that.

In ""TRIED"", E is at 4 -> okay.

In ""ERUPT"", E is at 1 -> okay.

So ""TRIED"" is acceptable.

Let me choose ""TRIED"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""TRIED"" is a valid English word.

So I'll go with ""TRIED"".

But let me see if there's a word that tests O or S.

For example: ""PROSE"" (P, R, O, S, E) -> but E at position 5 -> avoid.

""ROUSE"" (R at position 1, but we need R at position 2) -> not matching.

""FROZE"" (F, R, O, Z, E) -> E at 5 -> avoid.

""GRIME"" (G, R, I, M, E) -> E at 5 -> avoid.

So to avoid E at 5, we need to have E in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Another word: ""DRIVE"" (D, R, I, V, E) -> E at 5 -> avoid.

""TRIPE"" (T, R, I, P, E) -> E at 5 -> avoid.

So many words end with E. 

""CRIME"" has C, invalid.

""BRINE"" has N, invalid.

So ""TRIED"" with E at 4 is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""OPTER"" is not a common word.

""OILER"" (O, I, L, E, R) -> but R is at position 5, but we need R at position 2. So not.

We must have R at position 2.

So I think ""TRIED"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, I will guess ""TRIED"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, marked with ✓).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked with -).

Key insights for the next guess:
- The second letter must be R.
- E must appear in the word, but not in the fifth position (so positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible).
- The word cannot contain C, A, or N.
- To maximize information, the new guess should test common unused letters (e.g., T, I, D, S, O, L) and avoid repeating the fifth-position E.

The word ""tried"" fits these criteria:
- It has R as the second letter.
- It places E in the fourth position (avoiding the fifth position).
- It introduces new common letters: T (position 1), I (position 3), and D (position 5).
- It avoids C, A, and N.

This guess will help identify the positions of E and R while testing three new letters.",Guess 2: tried -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) I(x) E(✓) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,TRUER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word that covers common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

So we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed it there and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Has R as the second letter (since it's fixed in position).
- Includes the letter E (because it's in the word) but not in the fifth position.
- Avoids the letters C, A, and N.

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

Possible approach:
- Since R is fixed at position 2, we can try words that start with different letters to test other positions.
- We know E is in the word but not at the end, so we can try E in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let's think of words that have R as the second letter and include E, and avoid C, A, N.

Some examples:
- Try E at position 1: E _ R _ _
  - Words: ""ERECT"" (but has C and T? We know C is out, so no), ""ERUPT"" (has U, P, T), ""ERASE"" (has A and S, but A is out) -> not good.
  - Instead, how about ""EERIE""? But that has two E's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, it has I and E again.

Alternatively, try E at position 3: _ R E _ _
  - Words: ""TREND"" (but T is new, D is new; but we have R fixed and E at 3) -> but we know N is out, so ""TREND"" has N -> invalid because N is not in the word? Actually, the feedback said N is not in the word, so we cannot use N.

We must avoid C, A, N.

Let me list some words with R as second letter and E somewhere (not at position 5) and without C, A, N.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, I, D, G, U, etc.

Possible words:
- ""PRESENT"" is 6 letters, too long.
- We need 5 letters.

Try E at position 1: ""E R _ _ _""
- Options: ""ERECT"" (invalid because of C), ""ERUPT"" (E, R, U, P, T) -> valid? Let's check: E at 1, R at 2, U at 3, P at 4, T at 5. But we know E is in the word but not at position 5? Actually, we have E at position 1, which is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at position 5. However, we don't know if E can be at position 1. Also, we are trying to test new letters.

But note: the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 5. It could be at position 1, 3, or 4.

Another word: ""ERODE"" (E, R, O, D, E). This has two E's. The word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But the feedback didn't indicate duplicate, so we have to consider it possible.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Try without duplicate E.

Word: ""ERUPT"" - letters: E, R, U, P, T. None of these are C, A, N. And E is at position 1.

But we have R at position 2, which is fixed. And E at 1: if the word has E at 1, then we would get a ✓ for E? But we don't know if E is at 1. Alternatively, if E is at 3 or 4, then in ""ERUPT"" the E at 1 would be marked as x or -? Actually, if the word has only one E and it's at position 3, then the E at position 1 would be marked as x (not in the word) or - (if it were in the word but wrong position)? But the word has only one E? We don't know.

Actually, the feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and marked as - (meaning present but not at 5). So the word has at least one E. It might have more.

But to be safe, let's try a word that has E in a different position and also tests other common letters.

Another idea: put E at position 3: _ R E _ _
- Words: ""GREEK"" (has G, R, E, E, K -> two E's and K) but we don't know about duplicates. Also, we are avoiding A, C, N, so G, R, E, K are okay? But two E's: if the word has only one E, then the second E might be marked as x? But we don't mind because we are testing.

But let's think of words without duplicates: 
- ""TREES"" is 5 letters but has two E's and ends with S? Also, we don't know about S.

Better: ""TREND"" but has N -> invalid because N is not in the word (from first feedback).

Another: ""BREED"" (has B, R, E, E, D) -> two E's and B and D. But we don't know about B and D.

But we also know that the first letter is not C (because C was in the first guess and was x). So we can try B? 

Wait, the first guess had C at position 1 and it was x, so the first letter is not C. But it could be any other letter.

Let me try to list words with pattern: [not C, A, N] R [not C, A, N] [not C, A, N] [not C, A, N] and including E (but not at position 5? Actually, we can put E at position 5? No, because the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so we cannot put E at position 5 again. We must put E at 1, 3, or 4.

So positions: 
- Position 1: cannot be C, A, or N? Actually, we only know that C, A, N are not in the word at all. So we cannot use these letters anywhere.

Therefore, the entire word must not contain C, A, or N.

And we must include E (because we know it's in the word) and R at position 2.

So the word must have R at position 2 and E in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let me think of words that fit: 
- Position 1: any letter except C, A, N, and not E? We can try E at 1.
  - ""E R _ _ _"": e.g., ""ERECT"" (invalid because of C), ""ERUPT"" (E, R, U, P, T) -> valid? Yes, and U, P, T are new.
- Position 3: _ R E _ _
  - e.g., ""GREET"" (G, R, E, E, T) -> two E's, but we can try. Or ""TREES"" (T, R, E, E, S) -> two E's and S.
  - Without duplicates: ""PRESENT"" too long. ""DREGS"" (D, R, E, G, S) -> but S at the end? We don't know about S. Also, ""DREGS"" is a word? It means sediment.

But let's consider: we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Another word: ""BREAD"" (B, R, E, A, D) -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So invalid.

""BREED"" has two E's and no A, C, N: B, R, E, E, D.

""FREED"" (F, R, E, E, D) -> two E's.

""GREEN"" (G, R, E, E, N) -> has N, invalid.

""CREED"" has C, invalid.

So perhaps ""ERUPT"" is a good candidate: it uses E, R, U, P, T. All new letters except R and E (which we know are in the word). And it tests U, P, T.

But note: we are putting E at position 1. If the word has E at position 1, then we get a ✓ for E. If not, then we might get a - (if E is at 3 or 4) or even x? But we know E is in the word, so if it's not at 1, it would be marked as - (wrong position) because it's present. Actually, the feedback symbol for a letter that is in the word but not in the correct position is '-'.

So if we guess ""ERUPT"":
- If the E is at position 1 in the secret word, then E would be ✓.
- If the E is at position 3, then the E at position 1 would be marked as - (because E is in the word, but not at 1) and then we would also have the R at 2 as ✓, and then the other letters U, P, T would be checked.

But note: the secret word has exactly one E? Or more? We don't know. But if it has only one E, then if we put E at position 1 and the actual E is at position 3, then the E at 1 would be marked as - (meaning present) and then we know that the E must be at position 3? Actually, no: the - only tells us that the letter is in the word but not at that position. It doesn't tell us which position. But we can infer.

Alternatively, we can try to put E at position 3 to see if it is there.

But without more information, either is fine.

Another common word: ""ROUSE"" but R is at position 1, but we need R at position 2.

We need R at position 2.

Another word: ""WRECK"" has C? No, W, R, E, C, K -> C is invalid.

""PRESS"" (P, R, E, S, S) -> has two S's. And E at position 3.

But we don't know about S.

I think ""ERUPT"" is a reasonable guess.

But let me check if there are other words that might cover more common letters.

Another word: ""TRIED"" (T, R, I, E, D) -> E at position 4. This avoids C, A, N. Letters: T, R, I, E, D.

This also tests T, I, D.

Compared to ""ERUPT"", which tests E, R, U, P, T.

""TRIED"" has T at position 1, R at 2, I at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

We know E is not at 5, so putting E at 4 is okay.

And we test I and D.

Both are valid.

But note: in ""TRIED"", we are testing E at position 4. If the secret word has E at position 4, then we get a ✓ for E. If not, then we get a - for E (if it's at 1 or 3) and then we know it's not at 4.

Similarly, in ""ERUPT"", we test E at 1.

I think both are acceptable. Let me choose one.

I'll go with ""TRIED"" because it tests more vowels (I) and common consonants (T, D).

But we already have T in ""ERUPT"" as well? Actually, ""ERUPT"" has T at the end.

But ""TRIED"" has I, which is a vowel we haven't tried.

We haven't tried I, O, U, etc.

In the first guess, we tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so we have tried R, E, and also A (which is out) and C (out), N (out). So we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So we have many letters left.

In ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> new letters: T, I, D.

In ""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> new letters: U, P, T.

Both test T. ""TRIED"" tests I and D, ""ERUPT"" tests U and P.

I think I is more common than U and P, so ""TRIED"" might be better.

But we also know that the word has E, so we are including E again, which is necessary.

Another word: ""PRICE"" -> but has C, invalid.

""BRIDE"" (B, R, I, D, E) -> E at position 5? But we cannot put E at position 5 because the feedback said E is not at position 5. So if we put E at 5, it would be wrong and we might get a - again? But we know it's not at 5, so we should avoid position 5 for E.

In ""BRIDE"", E is at 5 -> so we should avoid that.

In ""TRIED"", E is at 4 -> okay.

In ""ERUPT"", E is at 1 -> okay.

So ""TRIED"" is acceptable.

Let me choose ""TRIED"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""TRIED"" is a valid English word.

So I'll go with ""TRIED"".

But let me see if there's a word that tests O or S.

For example: ""PROSE"" (P, R, O, S, E) -> but E at position 5 -> avoid.

""ROUSE"" (R at position 1, but we need R at position 2) -> not matching.

""FROZE"" (F, R, O, Z, E) -> E at 5 -> avoid.

""GRIME"" (G, R, I, M, E) -> E at 5 -> avoid.

So to avoid E at 5, we need to have E in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Another word: ""DRIVE"" (D, R, I, V, E) -> E at 5 -> avoid.

""TRIPE"" (T, R, I, P, E) -> E at 5 -> avoid.

So many words end with E. 

""CRIME"" has C, invalid.

""BRINE"" has N, invalid.

So ""TRIED"" with E at 4 is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""OPTER"" is not a common word.

""OILER"" (O, I, L, E, R) -> but R is at position 5, but we need R at position 2. So not.

We must have R at position 2.

So I think ""TRIED"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, I will guess ""TRIED"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, marked with ✓).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked with -).

Key insights for the next guess:
- The second letter must be R.
- E must appear in the word, but not in the fifth position (so positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible).
- The word cannot contain C, A, or N.
- To maximize information, the new guess should test common unused letters (e.g., T, I, D, S, O, L) and avoid repeating the fifth-position E.

The word ""tried"" fits these criteria:
- It has R as the second letter.
- It places E in the fourth position (avoiding the fifth position).
- It introduces new common letters: T (position 1), I (position 3), and D (position 5).
- It avoids C, A, and N.

This guess will help identify the positions of E and R while testing three new letters.

But the word has only one E? We don\'t know.\n\nActually, the feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and marked as - (meaning present but not at 5). So the word has at least one E. It might have more.\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s try a word that has E in a different position and also tests other common letters.\n\nAnother idea: put E at position 3: _ R E _ _\n- Words: ""GREEK"" (has G, R, E, E, K -> two E\'s and K) but we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we are avoiding A, C, N, so G, R, E, K are okay? But two E\'s: if the word has only one E, then the second E might be marked as x? But we don\'t mind because we are testing.\n\nBut let\'s think of words without duplicates: \n- ""TREES"" is 5 letters but has two E\'s and ends with S? Also, we don\'t know about S.\n\nBetter: ""TREND"" but has N -> invalid because N is not in the word (from first feedback).\n\nAnother: ""BREED"" (has B, R, E, E, D) -> two E\'s and B and D. But we don\'t know about B and D.\n\nBut we also know that the first letter is not C (because C was in the first guess and was x). So we can try B? \n\nWait, the first guess had C at position 1 and it was x, so the first letter is not C. But it could be any other letter.\n\nLet me try to list words with pattern: [not C, A, N] R [not C, A, N] [not C, A, N] [not C, A, N] and including E (but not at position 5? Actually, we can put E at position 5? No, because the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so we cannot put E at position 5 again. We must put E at 1, 3, or 4.\n\nSo positions: \n- Position 1: cannot be C, A, or N? Actually, we only know that C, A, N are not in the word at all. So we cannot use these letters anywhere.\n\nTherefore, the entire word must not contain C, A, or N.\n\nAnd we must include E (because we know it\'s in the word) and R at position 2.\n\nSo the word must have R at position 2 and E in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nLet me think of words that fit: \n- Position 1: any letter except C, A, N, and not E? We can try E at 1.\n  - ""E R _ _ _"": e.g., ""ERECT"" (invalid because of C), ""ERUPT"" (E, R, U, P, T) -> valid? Yes, and U, P, T are new.\n- Position 3: _ R E _ _\n  - e.g., ""GREET"" (G, R, E, E, T) -> two E\'s, but we can try. Or ""TREES"" (T, R, E, E, S) -> two E\'s and S.\n  - Without duplicates: ""PRESENT"" too long. ""DREGS"" (D, R, E, G, S) -> but S at the end? We don\'t know about S. Also, ""DREGS"" is a word? It means sediment.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""BREAD"" (B, R, E, A, D) -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So invalid.\n\n""BREED"" has two E\'s and no A, C, N: B, R, E, E, D.\n\n""FREED"" (F, R, E, E, D) -> two E\'s.\n\n""GREEN"" (G, R, E, E, N) -> has N, invalid.\n\n""CREED"" has C, invalid.\n\nSo perhaps ""ERUPT"" is a good candidate: it uses E, R, U, P, T. All new letters except R and E (which we know are in the word). And it tests U, P, T.\n\nBut note: we are putting E at position 1. If the word has E at position 1, then we get a ✓ for E. If not, then we might get a - (if E is at 3 or 4) or even x? But we know E is in the word, so if it\'s not at 1, it would be marked as - (wrong position) because it\'s present. Actually, the feedback symbol for a letter that is in the word but not in the correct position is \'-\'.\n\nSo if we guess ""ERUPT"":\n- If the E is at position 1 in the secret word, then E would be ✓.\n- If the E is at position 3, then the E at position 1 would be marked as - (because E is in the word, but not at 1) and then we would also have the R at 2 as ✓, and then the other letters U, P, T would be checked.\n\nBut note: the secret word has exactly one E? Or more? We don\'t know. But if it has only one E, then if we put E at position 1 and the actual E is at position 3, then the E at 1 would be marked as - (meaning present) and then we know that the E must be at position 3? Actually, no: the - only tells us that the letter is in the word but not at that position. It doesn\'t tell us which position. But we can infer.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put E at position 3 to see if it is there.\n\nBut without more information, either is fine.\n\nAnother common word: ""ROUSE"" but R is at position 1, but we need R at position 2.\n\nWe need R at position 2.\n\nAnother word: ""WRECK"" has C? No, W, R, E, C, K -> C is invalid.\n\n""PRESS"" (P, R, E, S, S) -> has two S\'s. And E at position 3.\n\nBut we don\'t know about S.\n\nI think ""ERUPT"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut let me check if there are other words that might cover more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""TRIED"" (T, R, I, E, D) -> E at position 4. This avoids C, A, N. Letters: T, R, I, E, D.\n\nThis also tests T, I, D.\n\nCompared to ""ERUPT"", which tests E, R, U, P, T.\n\n""TRIED"" has T at position 1, R at 2, I at 3, E at 4, D at 5.\n\nWe know E is not at 5, so putting E at 4 is okay.\n\nAnd we test I and D.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nBut note: in ""TRIED"", we are testing E at position 4. If the secret word has E at position 4, then we get a ✓ for E. If not, then we get a - for E (if it\'s at 1 or 3) and then we know it\'s not at 4.\n\nSimilarly, in ""ERUPT"", we test E at 1.\n\nI think both are acceptable. Let me choose one.\n\nI\'ll go with ""TRIED"" because it tests more vowels (I) and common consonants (T, D).\n\nBut we already have T in ""ERUPT"" as well? Actually, ""ERUPT"" has T at the end.\n\nBut ""TRIED"" has I, which is a vowel we haven\'t tried.\n\nWe haven\'t tried I, O, U, etc.\n\nIn the first guess, we tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so we have tried R, E, and also A (which is out) and C (out), N (out). So we haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nSo we have many letters left.\n\nIn ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> new letters: T, I, D.\n\nIn ""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> new letters: U, P, T.\n\nBoth test T. ""TRIED"" tests I and D, ""ERUPT"" tests U and P.\n\nI think I is more common than U and P, so ""TRIED"" might be better.\n\nBut we also know that the word has E, so we are including E again, which is necessary.\n\nAnother word: ""PRICE"" -> but has C, invalid.\n\n""BRIDE"" (B, R, I, D, E) -> E at position 5? But we cannot put E at position 5 because the feedback said E is not at position 5. So if we put E at 5, it would be wrong and we might get a - again? But we know it\'s not at 5, so we should avoid position 5 for E.\n\nIn ""BRIDE"", E is at 5 -> so we should avoid that.\n\nIn ""TRIED"", E is at 4 -> okay.\n\nIn ""ERUPT"", E is at 1 -> okay.\n\nSo ""TRIED"" is acceptable.\n\nLet me choose ""TRIED"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""TRIED"" is a valid English word.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""TRIED"".\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that tests O or S.\n\nFor example: ""PROSE"" (P, R, O, S, E) -> but E at position 5 -> avoid.\n\n""ROUSE"" (R at position 1, but we need R at position 2) -> not matching.\n\n""FROZE"" (F, R, O, Z, E) -> E at 5 -> avoid.\n\n""GRIME"" (G, R, I, M, E) -> E at 5 -> avoid.\n\nSo to avoid E at 5, we need to have E in positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nAnother word: ""DRIVE"" (D, R, I, V, E) -> E at 5 -> avoid.\n\n""TRIPE"" (T, R, I, P, E) -> E at 5 -> avoid.\n\nSo many words end with E. \n\n""CRIME"" has C, invalid.\n\n""BRINE"" has N, invalid.\n\nSo ""TRIED"" with E at 4 is a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""OPTER"" is not a common word.\n\n""OILER"" (O, I, L, E, R) -> but R is at position 5, but we need R at position 2. So not.\n\nWe must have R at position 2.\n\nSo I think ""TRIED"" is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""TRIED"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are not in the secret word (marked with x).\n- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, marked with ✓).\n- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked with -).\n\nKey insights for the next guess:\n- The second letter must be R.\n- E must appear in the word, but not in the fifth position (so positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible).\n- The word cannot contain C, A, or N.\n- To maximize information, the new guess should test common unused letters (e.g., T, I, D, S, O, L) and avoid repeating the fifth-position E.\n\nThe word ""tried"" fits these criteria:\n- It has R as the second letter.\n- It places E in the fourth position (avoiding the fifth position).\n- It introduces new common letters: T (position 1), I (position 3), and D (position 5).\n- It avoids C, A, and N.\n\nThis guess will help identify the positions of E and R while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>tried</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tried -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) I(x) E(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the second guess ""tried"":
- T: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so T is the first letter)
- R: ✓ (remains correct in the second position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct and in the fourth position! So E is the fourth letter)
- D: x (not in the word)

From previous guesses:
Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-) meaning:
  - R is 2nd letter.
  - E is in the word but not at position 5.
Guess 2 (""tried""):
- T(✓) -> 1st letter is T.
- R(✓) -> 2nd letter is R.
- I(x) -> I is not in the word.
- E(✓) -> 4th letter is E.
- D(x) -> D is not in the word.

So now we know:
- The word starts with T, then R, then ? , then E, then ?.
- So the pattern is: T R _ E _
- We know the following letters are NOT in the word: C, A, N, I, D (from both feedbacks).
- We know the 4th letter is E.

We need to find a word that matches T R _ E _ and avoids C, A, N, I, D, and the ? must be filled with letters not excluded.

We also know from guess1 that E is in the word but not at position 5 (which we now know because we have E at position 4). Additionally, the fifth letter is unknown.

So the word is: T R ? E ? 

We must choose a valid English word. The missing letters must not be C, A, N, I, D.

Let's consider common letters that could fit.

Possible words:
- ""TRUCE"": but has C (excluded) and U, E -> invalid because of C.
- ""TROPE"": T, R, O, P, E -> matches pattern. Letters: O and P, neither excluded. Also, E is at position 4. 
- ""TRITE"": T, R, I, T, E -> but I is excluded, so no.
- ""TRACE"": has A and C, both excluded.
- ""TRADE"": has A and D, both excluded.
- ""TRIBE"": has I (excluded) and E at 4? Pattern: T R I B E -> but I is excluded. Also, E at 5? Wait our word has E at 4? In ""TRIBE"", E is at position 5. Our pattern requires E at 4, not 5. So no.
- ""TROVE"": T, R, O, V, E -> pattern T R O V E -> but E is at position 5? No: 
  Positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E -> that's T R O V E, so E is at 5, but we need E at 4. So invalid pattern.
- ""TRODE"": T, R, O, D, E -> has D (excluded) and E at 5? Pattern: T R O D E -> E at 5? No.

We need E at position 4: so the fifth letter is something else.

So: T R _ E _ 

Examples:
- ""TROPE"": T, R, O, P, E -> here position 4 is P? No: 
  1: T, 2:R, 3:O, 4:P, 5:E -> that doesn't have E at 4. We need E at 4.

Clarify: the pattern is T R X E Y, where X is the third letter, E is fourth, and Y is fifth.

So the word must have E at the fourth position: so the ending should be E for the fourth letter and then a fifth letter.

Possible words:
- ""TRUCE"" -> but C excluded.
- ""TREES"" -> T, R, E, E, S -> but E is at position 3 and 4. We need E at 4? Yes, but also at 3? Pattern: T R E E S -> positions: 3:E, 4:E -> so fourth is E, which is good. But we also have E at 3, which might be acceptable? Also, we haven't excluded S. However, we know from guess1 that E is in the word but not at 5, which is satisfied.

But the word ""TREES"" has E at position 3 and 4? We don't know if the word has multiple E's.

Alternative: ""TRIES"" -> but I is excluded.
""TRAPS"" -> A excluded.

Another: ""TROVE"" has E at 5 -> not.
""TREKS"" -> T, R, E, K, S -> so E at position 3? Not at 4.

We need E at position 4.

Look for words ending with ""E"" as the fourth letter? Actually, the fourth letter is E and then another letter at 5.

So words like: * * * E * 

With first two letters T R.

So: TR followed by one letter, then E, then one letter.

Examples:
- ""TROPE"" is not because it's T R O P E -> 4 is P, 5 is E -> should be E at 4? No.

Recheck pattern: We have 1:T, 2:R, then 3:?, 4:E, 5:?.

So for ""TROPE"" - it would be pos1:T, pos2:R, pos3:O, pos4:P, pos5:E -> that's no E at 4.

We need a word where the fourth letter is E. So the word should be T R X E Y.

Like:
- ""TRUCE"" -> T R U C E -> but C at 4? Then E at 5 -> not.
- ""TREED"" -> T R E E D -> but D excluded and E at 3 and 4? Actually, E at 3: T(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5). So E is at 4? Yes, but D is excluded.
- ""GREEK"" doesn't start with TR.

Hard to find? Let's think.

Another idea: ""THREE"" -> T H R E E -> but that has R at position 3? Not: T(1), H(2), R(3), E(4), E(5). So second letter is H, not R. We need R at position 2.

Common words: ""TRIED"" we already used, but that had E at 4? ""TRIED"": T(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), D(5). Yes, but we guessed that.

But we are looking for the secret word? No, we are making the third guess.

We need to guess a new word that matches what we know: T R _ E _

And we know the missing letters can be any except C, A, N, I, D.

Also, we haven't used letters like: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But common ones.

Possible words in English: 
- ""TROPE"" doesn't fit.
- ""TRACE"" has A, excluded.
- Maybe ""TROVE"" is not.

Another: ""TRIPE"" - T, R, I, P, E -> but I excluded? Yes. Also E at 5 -> no, pattern: T(1), R(2), I(3), P(4), E(5) -> fourth position is P, fifth is E. We need fourth to be E.

That means the word must have E at the fourth position. Examples:
- ""BRIDE"" but B R I D E -> R at 2? Yes, E at 5 -> no.
- ""CRUDE"" C excluded.
- ""PRIDE"" P R I D E -> I excluded.

Perhaps ""TRUEE"" isn't a word.

What about ""TRESE"" or similar? Not standard.

Common words: 
- ""TREAT"" -> T, R, E, A, T -> A excluded, E at position 3? Position: 1:T, 2:R, 3:E, 4:A, 5:T -> but we need E at position 4? No, E is at 3.

We need E specifically at the fourth index.

List: 
- ""APPLE"" doesn't start with T.
- ""GRUEL"" doesn't.

Maybe ""THREW"": T, H, R, E, W -> but then positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:R, 4:E, 5:W -> that's R at 3, not 2. So second letter is H.

But we need R at position 2.

So fixed: position1: T, position2: R, position4: E.

So it must be: T R ? E ? 

Using a word finder in mind: 
- ""TRACE"" -> excluded.
- ""TRADE"" -> excluded.
- ""TRAIL"" -> A excluded and no E.
- ""TREND"" -> N excluded.
- ""TRESS"" -> T, R, E, S, S -> positions: 3:E -> then 4:S? So T(1), R(2), E(3), S(4), S(5). Fourth is S, not E.

But we have E at 3? We need E at 4.

Perhaps ""TIRES"" -> T, I, R, E, S -> R at 3? No.

Maybe ""TORES"" -> T, O, R, E, S -> R at 3.

Not.

I think ""TRUCE"" and ""TRIBE"" are not matching.

Another possibility: ""TRICE"" -> T, R, I, C, E -> I and C excluded. Also, E at 5.

Not.

Wait, are we missing a word? ""TROSE"" is not a word.

What about ""TRULE"" or ""TREDE""? Not real words.

Perhaps ""THREE"" as before, with R at 3.

I see the issue: perhaps the word ""TREE""? But that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Another idea: ""STARE"" starts with S.

Perhaps the word is ""TREND"" excluded.

Or ""FREED"" not starting with T.

I think I recall: ""TREES"" can be considered: T, R, E, E, S -> wait:
- Position1: T
- Position2: R
- Position3: E
- Position4: E
- Position5: S

So the fourth letter is E (the second E). So it does have E at position 4. Also, the fifth letter is S.

And S is not excluded.

But we have E at position 3 and 4? But that's acceptable if the word has multiple E's? Yes.

From feedback, we know E is in the word (from guess1) and we have one E at position 4 confirmed.

But also, in ""TREES"", there is an E at position 3, which may or may not be in the secret word? But we know E is present, and if there are multiple, then okay.

Moreover, we haven't ruled out S.

Another word: ""TREKS"" -> T, R, E, K, S -> E at position 3, not 4.

Then ""TRESS"": T, R, E, S, S -> E at position 3? Then 4:S, 5:S.

Not E at 4.

What about ""TRODE"" has D and E at 5.

Perhaps ""PROTE"" not.

I found: ""TAWSE"" not.

A common word that fits T R _ E _ is ""TRUCE"" but E at 5 -> no.

Wait, let me think again: perhaps the word is ""TRIED"", but we already guessed that? And the feedback showed T, R, and E correct, but D and I wrong.

So the secret word must have T at 1, R at 2, E at 4, and the third and fifth letters are neither I nor D.

So possible:

Third letter: not C, A, N, I, D, but we can use any other letter.

Fifth letter: similarly.

And it must be a valid word.

Candidates:
- Third letter: say O -> then T R O E ? - but what word? ""TROPE"" has E at 5, not or.
Actually, if we have E at 4, then the last letter must be specified.

Perhaps the word ""TROUE"" is not a word.

Another: ""TRUER"" -> T, R, U, E, R -> positions: 1:T,2:R,3:U,4:E,5:R -> this has E at 4! And letters: U, R. R at 5: but R is already in the word, but that's okay.

And U is not excluded. Also, we can use R again? Because the feedback didn't say anything about duplicates.

So ""TRUER"" is a valid English word? Meaning more true? Yes, adjective form.

Similarly, ""TRUED"" but D excluded.

""TRUER"": T, R, U, E, R -> pattern matches T R U E R.

Letters: U and R. R is repeated, but okay.

U is not in excluded list.

Another possibility: ""THREE"" but second letter is H, not R.

Or ""TRESS"" not E at 4.

Another: ""TREAT"" not.

How about ""TREES"" as before: T, R, E, E, S -> E at positions 3 and 4, but we need E at 4? Yes, position 4 is E. And third letter is E, which we don't know yet.

But is ""TREES"" 5 letters? Yes.

Also, S at the end.

We also have ""TREST"" not a common word.

Or ""TRAPS"" A excluded.

So two strong candidates: ""TREES"" and ""TRUER"".

Also, ""TROM E"" not.

""TROOZE"" not.

Or ""GRUEL"" not.

Another: ""TRACE"" excluded.

Let's consider the feedback we have: we know T, R, E positions, and exclusions.

In ""TREES"":
- T at 1: should be correct.
- R at 2: correct.
- E at 3: if the secret word has E at 3, then it would be ✓, but we don't know yet.
- E at 4: ✓ (already known)
- S at 5: unknown.

If we guess ""TREES"", and the secret word has only one E (at position 4), then the E at position 3 would be marked as - (since E is in the word but not at 3) or possibly as ✓ if it is there! Or if there is another E at 3? We don't know.

Similarly, in ""TRUER"":
- T1 ✓, R2 ✓, U3 new, E4 ✓, R5 new.

But R at 5: if the secret word has R at 5, then ✓; if not, but R is in the word (at position 2), then if there is another R, it might be marked as - if not correct position? Or only one R? The feedback only marks each instance.

The rules: it might have duplicates.

But to be safe, maybe guess a word that doesn't have duplicates and tests new letters.

Another candidate: what about ""TROUE""? Not a word.

I think ""TRUER"" and ""TREES"" are possible.

But also, ""PROTE"" not.

Wait, ""TROUGH"" too long.

Perhaps ""BROKE"" not starting with T.

Or ""TROKE"" is not common.

Another: ""TRUDE"" - but D excluded? TRUDE: T, R, U, D, E -> D excluded and E at 5.

Not.

""TRUCE"" has C and E at 5.

We have ""TUNE"" 4 letters.

Perhaps ""ETRES"" not starting with T.

After research in mind, common words: ""THRLE"" not.

Perhaps ""TROLL"" no E.

Not many common words fit T R X E Y.

Another: ""TRINE"" -> T, R, I, N, E -> I and N excluded, and E at 5.

No.

""TRIPE"" has I and E at 5.

But we have ""TRICE"" excluded.

Perhaps ""TRIES"" has I.

But S at 5.

With I excluded.

No.

So back to ""TREES"" and ""TRUER"".

""TRUER"" is a word: it means more true. Valid.

""TREES"" is valid.

Also, ""TREYS"" -> T, R, E, Y, S? E at 3? T(1), R(2), E(3), Y(4), S(5). But we need E at 4? No.

Not.

Perhaps ""TEXES"" not.

I think we have to choose between ""TREES"" and ""TRUER"".

Also, ""THREE"" doesn't have R at 2.

Another word: ""STARE"" not starting with T.

Perhaps ""wrote"" not.

I think ""TRUER"" or ""TREES"" are reasonable.

But in ""TREES"", there might be two E's, so if we guess and the secret word has only the E at position 4, then the E at position 3 would be marked as - because in the word but wrong position? But we already know E is in the word, so the - or x would tell us if there is an additional E? 

If there is only one E (at position 4), then an E at position 3 would be marked as - (present but not at position 3). And since we know E is at position 4, that is fine.

But it doesn't give new information about the third letter? Actually, in ""TREES"", if we are lucky, it might be the word.

But we are at the third guess, so we hope to guess correctly or get closer.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests new letters.

For example, ""TRUER"" tests U and has R again.

To test more used letters, perhaps ""TROVE"" but E at 5 -> pattern not.

Another idea: ""FRIED"" has D and I and R at 1? No.

Perhaps ""GREET"" not starting with T.

I think we should choose one.

Let me pick ""TRUER"" because it has all distinct except for the R? Positions: T, R, U, E, R -> two R's. We don't know if the word has two R's.

Similarly, in ""TREES"", two E's.

But ""TRUER"" tests U which is new.

Or ""TROPE"" is not matching pattern.

Another word: ""TRACE"" excluded.

I think ""TRUER"" is a valid choice.

But letter U is less common.

""TREES"" tests S, but S is common.

We might also consider ""tiers"" not starting T R.

Perhaps ""PUREE"" not.

I will go with ""TREES"" for now.

But in ""TREES"": E at position 3? We need the fourth letter to be E, that is position 4. In ""TREES"", position 3 is E and position 4 is also E? No: T-R-E-E-S -> positions:
1: T
2: R
3: E
4: E
5: S

So fourth letter is E, as required.

So it matches: T R E E S.

The third letter is E, which we don't know yet.

If we guess ""TREES"":
- If the secret word has E at position 3, then it will be marked correctly.
- If not, then marked as -.

Also, S at position 5.

Moreover, it might be the solution.

But from feedback, we have exclusions.

Another possibility: ""TROUT"" has U and T, but no E and not matching pattern.

Or ""TRUST"" no E.

I think ""TREES"" or ""TRUER"".

Let me choose ""TRUER"": T R U E R.

This has U and R (again).

But it fits the known pattern.

So I'll guess ""TRUER"".

Or to test more common lettres, what about ""TRUST"" but no E.

Not.

""FRERT"" not.

""TRUCE"" excluded.

So final decision: ""TRUER"".

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Analyzing previous feedback:**
   - **Guess 1: ""crane""**: 
     - C(x) → C is not in the word.
     - R(✓) → R is in the correct position (position 2).
     - A(x) → A is not in the word.
     - N(x) → N is not in the word.
     - E(-) → E is in the word but not at position 5.
   - **Guess 2: ""tried""**:
     - T(✓) → T is in the correct position (position 1).
     - R(✓) → R is in the correct position (position 2).
     - I(x) → I is not in the word.
     - E(✓) → E is in the correct position (position 4).
     - D(x) → D is not in the word.

2. **Current known information about the secret word:**
   - **Fixed positions**:
     - Position 1: T
     - Position 2: R
     - Position 4: E
   - **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, I, D (from both guesses). These cannot appear anywhere in the word.
   - **Unknown positions**: Position 3 and 5 must be filled with letters not in the excluded list.
   - **Word pattern**: T R _ E _ 
   - E is confirmed at position 4, and cannot be at position 5 (from first guess feedback).
   - Possible letters for position 3 and 5: Any letter except C, A, N, I, D. Common unused letters include: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

3. **Generating potential guesses**:
   - Need a valid 5-letter English word that fits T R _ E _ and avoids excluded letters.
   - Candidates:
     - ""truer"": T R U E R → Tests U (new) and reuses R (which is already at position 2; feedback rules allow duplicates). U is not excluded.
     - ""trees"": T R E E S → Tests E at position 3 (new position for E) and S. E and S are not excluded, but E duplication might provide redundant feedback since E is already confirmed at position 4.
     - ""trope"": T R O P E → Incorrect pattern; E is at position 5, but we need E at position 4.
     - Other options like ""trice"" (excluded I/C), ""trade"" (excluded A/D), or ""tribe"" (excluded I) are invalid.
   - **Selection criteria**: Prioritize words that test new, common letters and fit the pattern exactly. ""truer"" tests U (vowel-like) and avoids redundant E testing. It also maintains the correct positions for T, R, and E.

4. **Why ""truer""?**
   - Validates position 3 with U and position 5 with R.
   - If U is incorrect, feedback will reveal if it's absent or misplaced.
   - Position 5 R tests for duplication (if R appears elsewhere, feedback may show misposition or confirm).
   - Avoids excluded letters and maximizes new information with U.

<guess>truer</guess>",truer,"We are given feedback from the second guess ""tried"":
- T: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so T is the first letter)
- R: ✓ (remains correct in the second position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct and in the fourth position! So E is the fourth letter)
- D: x (not in the word)

From previous guesses:
Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-) meaning:
  - R is 2nd letter.
  - E is in the word but not at position 5.
Guess 2 (""tried""):
- T(✓) -> 1st letter is T.
- R(✓) -> 2nd letter is R.
- I(x) -> I is not in the word.
- E(✓) -> 4th letter is E.
- D(x) -> D is not in the word.

So now we know:
- The word starts with T, then R, then ? , then E, then ?.
- So the pattern is: T R _ E _
- We know the following letters are NOT in the word: C, A, N, I, D (from both feedbacks).
- We know the 4th letter is E.

We need to find a word that matches T R _ E _ and avoids C, A, N, I, D, and the ? must be filled with letters not excluded.

We also know from guess1 that E is in the word but not at position 5 (which we now know because we have E at position 4). Additionally, the fifth letter is unknown.

So the word is: T R ? E ? 

We must choose a valid English word. The missing letters must not be C, A, N, I, D.

Let's consider common letters that could fit.

Possible words:
- ""TRUCE"": but has C (excluded) and U, E -> invalid because of C.
- ""TROPE"": T, R, O, P, E -> matches pattern. Letters: O and P, neither excluded. Also, E is at position 4. 
- ""TRITE"": T, R, I, T, E -> but I is excluded, so no.
- ""TRACE"": has A and C, both excluded.
- ""TRADE"": has A and D, both excluded.
- ""TRIBE"": has I (excluded) and E at 4? Pattern: T R I B E -> but I is excluded. Also, E at 5? Wait our word has E at 4? In ""TRIBE"", E is at position 5. Our pattern requires E at 4, not 5. So no.
- ""TROVE"": T, R, O, V, E -> pattern T R O V E -> but E is at position 5? No: 
  Positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E -> that's T R O V E, so E is at 5, but we need E at 4. So invalid pattern.
- ""TRODE"": T, R, O, D, E -> has D (excluded) and E at 5? Pattern: T R O D E -> E at 5? No.

We need E at position 4: so the fifth letter is something else.

So: T R _ E _ 

Examples:
- ""TROPE"": T, R, O, P, E -> here position 4 is P? No: 
  1: T, 2:R, 3:O, 4:P, 5:E -> that doesn't have E at 4. We need E at 4.

Clarify: the pattern is T R X E Y, where X is the third letter, E is fourth, and Y is fifth.

So the word must have E at the fourth position: so the ending should be E for the fourth letter and then a fifth letter.

Possible words:
- ""TRUCE"" -> but C excluded.
- ""TREES"" -> T, R, E, E, S -> but E is at position 3 and 4. We need E at 4? Yes, but also at 3? Pattern: T R E E S -> positions: 3:E, 4:E -> so fourth is E, which is good. But we also have E at 3, which might be acceptable? Also, we haven't excluded S. However, we know from guess1 that E is in the word but not at 5, which is satisfied.

But the word ""TREES"" has E at position 3 and 4? We don't know if the word has multiple E's.

Alternative: ""TRIES"" -> but I is excluded.
""TRAPS"" -> A excluded.

Another: ""TROVE"" has E at 5 -> not.
""TREKS"" -> T, R, E, K, S -> so E at position 3? Not at 4.

We need E at position 4.

Look for words ending with ""E"" as the fourth letter? Actually, the fourth letter is E and then another letter at 5.

So words like: * * * E * 

With first two letters T R.

So: TR followed by one letter, then E, then one letter.

Examples:
- ""TROPE"" is not because it's T R O P E -> 4 is P, 5 is E -> should be E at 4? No.

Recheck pattern: We have 1:T, 2:R, then 3:?, 4:E, 5:?.

So for ""TROPE"" - it would be pos1:T, pos2:R, pos3:O, pos4:P, pos5:E -> that's no E at 4.

We need a word where the fourth letter is E. So the word should be T R X E Y.

Like:
- ""TRUCE"" -> T R U C E -> but C at 4? Then E at 5 -> not.
- ""TREED"" -> T R E E D -> but D excluded and E at 3 and 4? Actually, E at 3: T(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5). So E is at 4? Yes, but D is excluded.
- ""GREEK"" doesn't start with TR.

Hard to find? Let's think.

Another idea: ""THREE"" -> T H R E E -> but that has R at position 3? Not: T(1), H(2), R(3), E(4), E(5). So second letter is H, not R. We need R at position 2.

Common words: ""TRIED"" we already used, but that had E at 4? ""TRIED"": T(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), D(5). Yes, but we guessed that.

But we are looking for the secret word? No, we are making the third guess.

We need to guess a new word that matches what we know: T R _ E _

And we know the missing letters can be any except C, A, N, I, D.

Also, we haven't used letters like: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But common ones.

Possible words in English: 
- ""TROPE"" doesn't fit.
- ""TRACE"" has A, excluded.
- Maybe ""TROVE"" is not.

Another: ""TRIPE"" - T, R, I, P, E -> but I excluded? Yes. Also E at 5 -> no, pattern: T(1), R(2), I(3), P(4), E(5) -> fourth position is P, fifth is E. We need fourth to be E.

That means the word must have E at the fourth position. Examples:
- ""BRIDE"" but B R I D E -> R at 2? Yes, E at 5 -> no.
- ""CRUDE"" C excluded.
- ""PRIDE"" P R I D E -> I excluded.

Perhaps ""TRUEE"" isn't a word.

What about ""TRESE"" or similar? Not standard.

Common words: 
- ""TREAT"" -> T, R, E, A, T -> A excluded, E at position 3? Position: 1:T, 2:R, 3:E, 4:A, 5:T -> but we need E at position 4? No, E is at 3.

We need E specifically at the fourth index.

List: 
- ""APPLE"" doesn't start with T.
- ""GRUEL"" doesn't.

Maybe ""THREW"": T, H, R, E, W -> but then positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:R, 4:E, 5:W -> that's R at 3, not 2. So second letter is H.

But we need R at position 2.

So fixed: position1: T, position2: R, position4: E.

So it must be: T R ? E ? 

Using a word finder in mind: 
- ""TRACE"" -> excluded.
- ""TRADE"" -> excluded.
- ""TRAIL"" -> A excluded and no E.
- ""TREND"" -> N excluded.
- ""TRESS"" -> T, R, E, S, S -> positions: 3:E -> then 4:S? So T(1), R(2), E(3), S(4), S(5). Fourth is S, not E.

But we have E at 3? We need E at 4.

Perhaps ""TIRES"" -> T, I, R, E, S -> R at 3? No.

Maybe ""TORES"" -> T, O, R, E, S -> R at 3.

Not.

I think ""TRUCE"" and ""TRIBE"" are not matching.

Another possibility: ""TRICE"" -> T, R, I, C, E -> I and C excluded. Also, E at 5.

Not.

Wait, are we missing a word? ""TROSE"" is not a word.

What about ""TRULE"" or ""TREDE""? Not real words.

Perhaps ""THREE"" as before, with R at 3.

I see the issue: perhaps the word ""TREE""? But that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Another idea: ""STARE"" starts with S.

Perhaps the word is ""TREND"" excluded.

Or ""FREED"" not starting with T.

I think I recall: ""TREES"" can be considered: T, R, E, E, S -> wait:
- Position1: T
- Position2: R
- Position3: E
- Position4: E
- Position5: S

So the fourth letter is E (the second E). So it does have E at position 4. Also, the fifth letter is S.

And S is not excluded.

But we have E at position 3 and 4? But that's acceptable if the word has multiple E's? Yes.

From feedback, we know E is in the word (from guess1) and we have one E at position 4 confirmed.

But also, in ""TREES"", there is an E at position 3, which may or may not be in the secret word? But we know E is present, and if there are multiple, then okay.

Moreover, we haven't ruled out S.

Another word: ""TREKS"" -> T, R, E, K, S -> E at position 3, not 4.

Then ""TRESS"": T, R, E, S, S -> E at position 3? Then 4:S, 5:S.

Not E at 4.

What about ""TRODE"" has D and E at 5.

Perhaps ""PROTE"" not.

I found: ""TAWSE"" not.

A common word that fits T R _ E _ is ""TRUCE"" but E at 5 -> no.

Wait, let me think again: perhaps the word is ""TRIED"", but we already guessed that? And the feedback showed T, R, and E correct, but D and I wrong.

So the secret word must have T at 1, R at 2, E at 4, and the third and fifth letters are neither I nor D.

So possible:

Third letter: not C, A, N, I, D, but we can use any other letter.

Fifth letter: similarly.

And it must be a valid word.

Candidates:
- Third letter: say O -> then T R O E ? - but what word? ""TROPE"" has E at 5, not or.
Actually, if we have E at 4, then the last letter must be specified.

Perhaps the word ""TROUE"" is not a word.

Another: ""TRUER"" -> T, R, U, E, R -> positions: 1:T,2:R,3:U,4:E,5:R -> this has E at 4! And letters: U, R. R at 5: but R is already in the word, but that's okay.

And U is not excluded. Also, we can use R again? Because the feedback didn't say anything about duplicates.

So ""TRUER"" is a valid English word? Meaning more true? Yes, adjective form.

Similarly, ""TRUED"" but D excluded.

""TRUER"": T, R, U, E, R -> pattern matches T R U E R.

Letters: U and R. R is repeated, but okay.

U is not in excluded list.

Another possibility: ""THREE"" but second letter is H, not R.

Or ""TRESS"" not E at 4.

Another: ""TREAT"" not.

How about ""TREES"" as before: T, R, E, E, S -> E at positions 3 and 4, but we need E at 4? Yes, position 4 is E. And third letter is E, which we don't know yet.

But is ""TREES"" 5 letters? Yes.

Also, S at the end.

We also have ""TREST"" not a common word.

Or ""TRAPS"" A excluded.

So two strong candidates: ""TREES"" and ""TRUER"".

Also, ""TROM E"" not.

""TROOZE"" not.

Or ""GRUEL"" not.

Another: ""TRACE"" excluded.

Let's consider the feedback we have: we know T, R, E positions, and exclusions.

In ""TREES"":
- T at 1: should be correct.
- R at 2: correct.
- E at 3: if the secret word has E at 3, then it would be ✓, but we don't know yet.
- E at 4: ✓ (already known)
- S at 5: unknown.

If we guess ""TREES"", and the secret word has only one E (at position 4), then the E at position 3 would be marked as - (since E is in the word but not at 3) or possibly as ✓ if it is there! Or if there is another E at 3? We don't know.

Similarly, in ""TRUER"":
- T1 ✓, R2 ✓, U3 new, E4 ✓, R5 new.

But R at 5: if the secret word has R at 5, then ✓; if not, but R is in the word (at position 2), then if there is another R, it might be marked as - if not correct position? Or only one R? The feedback only marks each instance.

The rules: it might have duplicates.

But to be safe, maybe guess a word that doesn't have duplicates and tests new letters.

Another candidate: what about ""TROUE""? Not a word.

I think ""TRUER"" and ""TREES"" are possible.

But also, ""PROTE"" not.

Wait, ""TROUGH"" too long.

Perhaps ""BROKE"" not starting with T.

Or ""TROKE"" is not common.

Another: ""TRUDE"" - but D excluded? TRUDE: T, R, U, D, E -> D excluded and E at 5.

Not.

""TRUCE"" has C and E at 5.

We have ""TUNE"" 4 letters.

Perhaps ""ETRES"" not starting with T.

After research in mind, common words: ""THRLE"" not.

Perhaps ""TROLL"" no E.

Not many common words fit T R X E Y.

Another: ""TRINE"" -> T, R, I, N, E -> I and N excluded, and E at 5.

No.

""TRIPE"" has I and E at 5.

But we have ""TRICE"" excluded.

Perhaps ""TRIES"" has I.

But S at 5.

With I excluded.

No.

So back to ""TREES"" and ""TRUER"".

""TRUER"" is a word: it means more true. Valid.

""TREES"" is valid.

Also, ""TREYS"" -> T, R, E, Y, S? E at 3? T(1), R(2), E(3), Y(4), S(5). But we need E at 4? No.

Not.

Perhaps ""TEXES"" not.

I think we have to choose between ""TREES"" and ""TRUER"".

Also, ""THREE"" doesn't have R at 2.

Another word: ""STARE"" not starting with T.

Perhaps ""wrote"" not.

I think ""TRUER"" or ""TREES"" are reasonable.

But in ""TREES"", there might be two E's, so if we guess and the secret word has only the E at position 4, then the E at position 3 would be marked as - because in the word but wrong position? But we already know E is in the word, so the - or x would tell us if there is an additional E? 

If there is only one E (at position 4), then an E at position 3 would be marked as - (present but not at position 3). And since we know E is at position 4, that is fine.

But it doesn't give new information about the third letter? Actually, in ""TREES"", if we are lucky, it might be the word.

But we are at the third guess, so we hope to guess correctly or get closer.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests new letters.

For example, ""TRUER"" tests U and has R again.

To test more used letters, perhaps ""TROVE"" but E at 5 -> pattern not.

Another idea: ""FRIED"" has D and I and R at 1? No.

Perhaps ""GREET"" not starting with T.

I think we should choose one.

Let me pick ""TRUER"" because it has all distinct except for the R? Positions: T, R, U, E, R -> two R's. We don't know if the word has two R's.

Similarly, in ""TREES"", two E's.

But ""TRUER"" tests U which is new.

Or ""TROPE"" is not matching pattern.

Another word: ""TRACE"" excluded.

I think ""TRUER"" is a valid choice.

But letter U is less common.

""TREES"" tests S, but S is common.

We might also consider ""tiers"" not starting T R.

Perhaps ""PUREE"" not.

I will go with ""TREES"" for now.

But in ""TREES"": E at position 3? We need the fourth letter to be E, that is position 4. In ""TREES"", position 3 is E and position 4 is also E? No: T-R-E-E-S -> positions:
1: T
2: R
3: E
4: E
5: S

So fourth letter is E, as required.

So it matches: T R E E S.

The third letter is E, which we don't know yet.

If we guess ""TREES"":
- If the secret word has E at position 3, then it will be marked correctly.
- If not, then marked as -.

Also, S at position 5.

Moreover, it might be the solution.

But from feedback, we have exclusions.

Another possibility: ""TROUT"" has U and T, but no E and not matching pattern.

Or ""TRUST"" no E.

I think ""TREES"" or ""TRUER"".

Let me choose ""TRUER"": T R U E R.

This has U and R (again).

But it fits the known pattern.

So I'll guess ""TRUER"".

Or to test more common lettres, what about ""TRUST"" but no E.

Not.

""FRERT"" not.

""TRUCE"" excluded.

So final decision: ""TRUER"".### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
