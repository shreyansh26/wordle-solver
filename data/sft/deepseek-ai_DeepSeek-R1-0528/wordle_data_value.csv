We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter)

Therefore, we know:
  The word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
  The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A was the third letter, but it's marked as present but wrong position).
  The letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

We can use this information to make the next guess.

We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
  - Ends with E (since E is confirmed at position 5)
  - Contains the letter A (but not at position 3? Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not at the position we guessed, which was position 3. So A could be at position 1, 2, 4, or even 5? But position 5 is E, so A cannot be at 5. Also, note that A is present, so we must include it, but not at position 3.
  - Avoids the letters C, R, and N.

Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that end with E and contain A, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters we haven't tried: We have tried C, R, A, N, E. So we can use other vowels and consonants.

We know A is in the word, so we should try to place A in a different position (not position 3). Also, we can try to include other common letters like T, S, L, I, O, etc.

Possible positions for A: since it's not at position 3, and we know position 5 is E, we can try A at position 1, 2, or 4.

Let's try to think of words that end with E and have A in one of these positions.

Some examples:
  - A at position 1: words like ABASE, ABATE, ADAGE, etc. But we must avoid C, R, N.
  - A at position 2: words like SALVE, TABLE, etc.
  - A at position 4: words like BLARE, SCALE, but we must avoid C and R? Wait, we know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. Similarly, C is not in the word.

But note: we must avoid R and C and N.

Let me try to list words without C, R, N, ending with E, and containing A.

Possibilities:
  - A at position 1: ABATE, ADAGE, AGATE, ALATE, AMAZE, etc.
  - A at position 2: SALVE, VALVE, WAFTE (not a word), TABLE, MAPLE, etc.
  - A at position 4: BLADE? But we have to avoid R? BLADE has no R, but it has B, L, D. Also, we don't know about these.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more feedback.

Let me consider: SALVE? But we don't know if S, L, V are in the word. Also, note that in SALVE, A is at position 2.

But we have to avoid R? SALVE has no R? Actually, SALVE: S, A, L, V, E. No R, no C, no N. So that's acceptable.

However, we have to check if it's a valid word. Yes, SALVE is a word.

Another option: TABLE. T, A, B, L, E. Also avoids C, R, N.

But note: we have E at the end, and A at position 2.

We could also try to put A at position 1: for example, AGAPE? But that has G and P.

We want to maximize information. So using a word with common letters that we haven't tried yet.

We haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, D, M, P, etc.

I think TABLE is a good candidate: T, A, B, L, E. It has T and L which are common.

But note: we know A is in the word, and we are putting it at position 2. If the word has A at position 1 or 4, then we might get a '-' for A again, but that's okay because we can then narrow down.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has A at a position we haven't tried, such as position 1 or 4.

But let's also consider: we have only one known letter (E at the end) and one known present letter (A). We need to find the other three.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, and A is present, we can try a word that has A at position 4? For example, BLAME? But we don't know about B, L, M. And BLAME: B, L, A, M, E. Avoids C, R, N.

But we have to check if it's valid: yes.

However, we might also consider using a word that has two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. It's possible, but we don't have evidence.

Given that we have limited information, I think we should choose a word that uses common letters and avoids the ones we know are absent.

I'll go with ""SLATE"". But wait, we have feedback that A is present but not at position 3. In ""SLATE"", A is at position 3? Let me check: S-L-A-T-E. So A is at position 3. But we know from the feedback that A is not at position 3 in the secret word. So we cannot put A at position 3 again. Therefore, ""SLATE"" is not a good choice.

So we must avoid putting A at position 3.

Therefore, let's avoid position 3 for A.

Now, let's try to form a word with A at position 1: for example, ""ADOBE"". But that has O and B and D. But also, we don't know about these. However, ""ADOBE"" is a valid word.

But note: we have to avoid R, C, N. ""ADOBE"" has none of these.

Another common word: ""ALIKE"". But in ""ALIKE"", A is at position 1, and we have L, I, K, E. But we know E is at the end, so that's good. However, in ""ALIKE"", the last letter is E, so that's fixed. But the word is A-L-I-K-E. So A at 1, E at 5.

But we don't know if I and K are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try ""STALE"". But in ""STALE"", A is at position 3? S-T-A-L-E -> A is at position 3. We must avoid position 3 for A.

So ""STALE"" is invalid for A placement.

How about ""SAUTE"": S-A-U-T-E. A is at position 2. And we avoid position 3. Also, we get to test S, A, U, T, E. U is less common, but it's a valid word.

But we might want to use more common letters.

Another word: ""PLATE"". P-L-A-T-E -> A is at position 3 again. Not allowed.

So we need to avoid position 3 for A.

Let me think of words with A at position 1 or 2 or 4.

Position 4: for example, ""BLADE"": B-L-A-D-E -> A is at position 3? No, in ""BLADE"", the letters are: B (1), L (2), A (3), D (4), E (5). So A is at position 3. We must avoid that.

Wait, how about ""DELAY""? But ""DELAY"" ends with Y, not E.

We need the word to end with E.

Another word: ""BEIGE""? No A.

We need A.

How about ""LEASE""? L-E-A-S-E. But A is at position 3? L(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). So again position 3.

We need to avoid position 3.

Let me try to find words with A at position 1: 
  - ALONE: A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in the word (from first guess feedback: N was marked x). So we cannot use N.

  - ABASE: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). This has two A's. But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are using A at position 1 and 3. But we know that A is present (at least one), and we are avoiding position 3? Actually, we are allowed to use A at position 3 again? The feedback only said that in the first guess, A was at position 3 and it was wrong position. But it could be that the word has two A's? However, we don't know. But we are trying to get information. Also, we are using two A's, which might not be efficient.

  - AGATE: A(1), G(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). Again, two A's and A at position 3.

  - ALIVE: A(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5). This has A at 1, and avoids position 3 for A? Actually, we are putting A at 1, which is a new position. And we are not putting A at 3? But we are not using A at 3 in this word? The word has only one A at position 1. So that's acceptable.

But we have to check the letters: A, L, I, V, E. We know E is at the end. We avoid C, R, N. So ""ALIVE"" is a valid guess.

But note: we are using V, which is not very common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.

Another word: ""ABIDE"": A(1), B(2), I(3), D(4), E(5). This has A at 1, and we test B, I, D. Common letters? B and D are common.

But we don't know if the word has B, I, D.

Alternatively, ""ABOVE"": A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). Again, V is less common.

How about ""ASHES"": A(1), S(2), H(3), E(4), S(5). But the last letter is S, not E. We need the last letter to be E.

We need the word to end with E.

Another word: ""AWAKE"": A(1), W(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). This has two A's and A at position 3 again.

We are having trouble avoiding position 3? Actually, we don't have to avoid using A at position 3 in the guess, but if we do, and if the secret word has A at position 3, then we would get a ✓ for that. But in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. Therefore, if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be marked as '-' (if the secret word has only one A and it's not at 3) or if there are two A's, it might be marked as present but wrong position again? But we don't know if there are two A's.

However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to try A in a new position to get more information.

So let's try to put A at position 2.

Words with A at position 2 and ending with E:
  - VALVE: V(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). But V is repeated and not very common.
  - TABLE: T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). This is good: T, A, B, L, E. All new letters except A and E.
  - MAPLE: M(1), A(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). Also good.

Both TABLE and MAPLE are valid.

We can also try A at position 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter. Words ending with E and A at position 4: 
  - SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A is at position 3? No, in SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5). So A is at 3, not 4.
  - How about ""BLARE""? But we know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. Also, B(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> A is at 3.
  - ""GRACE"": G(1), R(2), A(3), C(4), E(5) -> again A at 3, and we cannot use R and C.

It seems difficult to have A at position 4 in a 5-letter word ending with E? Because the word structure: the fourth letter is the one before the last. So if the word ends with E, then position 4 is the fourth letter and position 5 is E.

For A to be at position 4, we would have a word like: ? ? ? A E. For example, ""PIZZA"" doesn't end with E. ""PIZZE"" is not a word. ""JAZZE"" is not a word. 

Actually, there are words: for example, ""OCTAVE"": O-C-T-A-V-E -> that's 6 letters. We need 5 letters.

Another: ""SUAVE"": S-U-A-V-E -> positions: S(1), U(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). So A is at position 3, not 4.

""GUANO"" doesn't end with E.

It's hard to find a 5-letter word ending with E that has A at position 4. So probably, A is at position 1 or 2.

Therefore, I think we should try A at position 2 to get new information.

So I'll choose ""TABLE"". It has T, A, B, L, E. We know E is at the end, so we are testing T, A, B, L in positions 1,2,3,4.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So my next guess: TABLE

But let me confirm: 
  T at 1, A at 2, B at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

We are avoiding C, R, N.

We are testing new letters: T, B, L.

This seems a good choice.

Alternatively, ""MAPLE"" is also good, but M is less common than T? T is more common.

So I'll go with ""TABLE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5 (marked ""✓"").

Key insights for the next guess:
- The word must end with ""E"".
- The word contains ""A"", but not at position 3.
- Avoid using C, R, and N.
- Test new common letters (e.g., T, B, L, S) to gather more information.

The next guess should:
- Place ""E"" at position 5.
- Include ""A"" in a new position (not position 3) to confirm its location.
- Use untried letters to maximize feedback.

A strong candidate is ""table"":
- T (new letter) at position 1.
- A at position 2 (new position for testing).
- B (new letter) at position 3.
- L (new letter) at position 4.
- E at position 5 (confirmed).

This tests common consonants and avoids known absent letters.

<guess>table</guess>",table,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter)

Therefore, we know:
  The word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
  The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A was the third letter, but it's marked as present but wrong position).
  The letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

We can use this information to make the next guess.

We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
  - Ends with E (since E is confirmed at position 5)
  - Contains the letter A (but not at position 3? Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not at the position we guessed, which was position 3. So A could be at position 1, 2, 4, or even 5? But position 5 is E, so A cannot be at 5. Also, note that A is present, so we must include it, but not at position 3.
  - Avoids the letters C, R, and N.

Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that end with E and contain A, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters we haven't tried: We have tried C, R, A, N, E. So we can use other vowels and consonants.

We know A is in the word, so we should try to place A in a different position (not position 3). Also, we can try to include other common letters like T, S, L, I, O, etc.

Possible positions for A: since it's not at position 3, and we know position 5 is E, we can try A at position 1, 2, or 4.

Let's try to think of words that end with E and have A in one of these positions.

Some examples:
  - A at position 1: words like ABASE, ABATE, ADAGE, etc. But we must avoid C, R, N.
  - A at position 2: words like SALVE, TABLE, etc.
  - A at position 4: words like BLARE, SCALE, but we must avoid C and R? Wait, we know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. Similarly, C is not in the word.

But note: we must avoid R and C and N.

  - A at position 4: BLADE? But we have to avoid R? BLADE has no R, but it has B, L, D. Also, we don't know about these.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more feedback.

Let me consider: SALVE? But we don't know if S, L, V are in the word. Also, note that in SALVE, A is at position 2.

But note: we have to avoid R, C, N. ""ADOBE"" has none of these.

But we don't know if I and K are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try ""STALE"". But in ""STALE"", A is at position 3? S-T-A-L-E -> A is at position 3. We must avoid position 3 for A.

So ""STALE"" is invalid for A placement.

How about ""SAUTE"": S-A-U-T-E. A is at position 2. And we avoid position 3. Also, we get to test S, A, U, T, E. U is less common, but it's a valid word.

Position 4: for example, ""BLADE"": B-L-A-D-E -> A is at position 3? No, in ""BLADE"", the letters are: B (1), L (2), A (3), D (4), E (5). So A is at position 3. We must avoid that.

  - ALONE: A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in the word (from first guess feedback: N was marked x). So we cannot use N.

  - ABASE: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). This has two A's. But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are using A at position 1 and 3. But we know that A is present (at least one), and we are avoiding position 3? Actually, we are allowed to use A at position 3 again? The feedback only said that in the first guess, A was at position 3 and it was wrong position. But it could be that the word has two A's? However, we don't know. But we are trying to get information. Also, we are using two A's, which might not be efficient.

  - AGATE: A(1), G(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). Again, two A's and A at position 3.

  - ALIVE: A(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5). This has A at 1, and avoids position 3 for A? Actually, we are putting A at 1, which is a new position. And we are not putting A at 3? But we are not using A at 3 in this word? The word has only one A at position 1. So that's acceptable.

But we have to check the letters: A, L, I, V, E. We know E is at the end. We avoid C, R, N. So ""ALIVE"" is a valid guess.

But note: we are using V, which is not very common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.

Another word: ""ABIDE"": A(1), B(2), I(3), D(4), E(5). This has A at 1, and we test B, I, D. Common letters? B and D are common.

But we don't know if the word has B, I, D.

Alternatively, ""ABOVE"": A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). Again, V is less common.

How about ""ASHES"": A(1), S(2), H(3), E(4), S(5). But the last letter is S, not E. We need the last letter to be E.

We need the word to end with E.

Another word: ""AWAKE"": A(1), W(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). This has two A's and A at position 3 again.

We are having trouble avoiding position 3? Actually, we don't have to avoid using A at position 3 in the guess, but if we do, and if the secret word has A at position 3, then we would get a ✓ for that. But in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. Therefore, if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be marked as '-' (if the secret word has only one A and it's not at 3) or if there are two A's, it might be marked as present but wrong position again? But we don't know if there are two A's.

However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to try A in a new position to get more information.

So let's try to put A at position 2.

Words with A at position 2 and ending with E:
  - VALVE: V(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). But V is repeated and not very common.
  - TABLE: T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). This is good: T, A, B, L, E. All new letters except A and E.
  - MAPLE: M(1), A(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). Also good.

Both TABLE and MAPLE are valid.

We can also try A at position 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter. Words ending with E and A at position 4: 
  - SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A is at position 3? No, in SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5). So A is at 3, not 4.
  - How about ""BLARE""? But we know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. Also, B(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> A is at 3.
  - ""GRACE"": G(1), R(2), A(3), C(4), E(5) -> again A at 3, and we cannot use R and C.

It seems difficult to have A at position 4 in a 5-letter word ending with E? Because the word structure: the fourth letter is the one before the last. So if the word ends with E, then position 4 is the fourth letter and position 5 is E.

For A to be at position 4, we would have a word like: ? ? ? A E. For example, ""PIZZA"" doesn't end with E. ""PIZZE"" is not a word. ""JAZZE"" is not a word. 

Actually, there are words: for example, ""OCTAVE"": O-C-T-A-V-E -> that's 6 letters. We need 5 letters.

Another: ""SUAVE"": S-U-A-V-E -> positions: S(1), U(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). So A is at position 3, not 4.

""GUANO"" doesn't end with E.

It's hard to find a 5-letter word ending with E that has A at position 4. So probably, A is at position 1 or 2.

Therefore, I think we should try A at position 2 to get new information.

So I'll choose ""TABLE"". It has T, A, B, L, E. We know E is at the end, so we are testing T, A, B, L in positions 1,2,3,4.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So my next guess: TABLE

But let me confirm: 
  T at 1, A at 2, B at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

We are avoiding C, R, N.

We are testing new letters: T, B, L.

This seems a good choice.

Alternatively, ""MAPLE"" is also good, but M is less common than T? T is more common.

So I'll go with ""TABLE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5 (marked ""✓"").

Key insights for the next guess:
- The word must end with ""E"".
- The word contains ""A"", but not at position 3.
- Avoid using C, R, and N.
- Test new common letters (e.g., T, B, L, S) to gather more information.

The next guess should:
- Place ""E"" at position 5.
- Include ""A"" in a new position (not position 3) to confirm its location.
- Use untried letters to maximize feedback.

A strong candidate is ""table"":
- T (new letter) at position 1.
- A at position 2 (new position for testing).
- B (new letter) at position 3.
- L (new letter) at position 4.
- E at position 5 (confirmed).

This tests common consonants and avoids known absent letters.",Guess 2: table -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,value,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter)

Therefore, we know:
  The word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
  The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A was the third letter, but it's marked as present but wrong position).
  The letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

We can use this information to make the next guess.

We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
  - Ends with E (since E is confirmed at position 5)
  - Contains the letter A (but not at position 3? Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not at the position we guessed, which was position 3. So A could be at position 1, 2, 4, or even 5? But position 5 is E, so A cannot be at 5. Also, note that A is present, so we must include it, but not at position 3.
  - Avoids the letters C, R, and N.

Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that end with E and contain A, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters we haven't tried: We have tried C, R, A, N, E. So we can use other vowels and consonants.

We know A is in the word, so we should try to place A in a different position (not position 3). Also, we can try to include other common letters like T, S, L, I, O, etc.

Possible positions for A: since it's not at position 3, and we know position 5 is E, we can try A at position 1, 2, or 4.

Let's try to think of words that end with E and have A in one of these positions.

Some examples:
  - A at position 1: words like ABASE, ABATE, ADAGE, etc. But we must avoid C, R, N.
  - A at position 2: words like SALVE, TABLE, etc.
  - A at position 4: words like BLARE, SCALE, but we must avoid C and R? Wait, we know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. Similarly, C is not in the word.

But note: we must avoid R and C and N.

Let me try to list words without C, R, N, ending with E, and containing A.

Possibilities:
  - A at position 1: ABATE, ADAGE, AGATE, ALATE, AMAZE, etc.
  - A at position 2: SALVE, VALVE, WAFTE (not a word), TABLE, MAPLE, etc.
  - A at position 4: BLADE? But we have to avoid R? BLADE has no R, but it has B, L, D. Also, we don't know about these.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more feedback.

Let me consider: SALVE? But we don't know if S, L, V are in the word. Also, note that in SALVE, A is at position 2.

But we have to avoid R? SALVE has no R? Actually, SALVE: S, A, L, V, E. No R, no C, no N. So that's acceptable.

However, we have to check if it's a valid word. Yes, SALVE is a word.

Another option: TABLE. T, A, B, L, E. Also avoids C, R, N.

But note: we have E at the end, and A at position 2.

We could also try to put A at position 1: for example, AGAPE? But that has G and P.

We want to maximize information. So using a word with common letters that we haven't tried yet.

We haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, D, M, P, etc.

I think TABLE is a good candidate: T, A, B, L, E. It has T and L which are common.

But note: we know A is in the word, and we are putting it at position 2. If the word has A at position 1 or 4, then we might get a '-' for A again, but that's okay because we can then narrow down.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has A at a position we haven't tried, such as position 1 or 4.

But let's also consider: we have only one known letter (E at the end) and one known present letter (A). We need to find the other three.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, and A is present, we can try a word that has A at position 4? For example, BLAME? But we don't know about B, L, M. And BLAME: B, L, A, M, E. Avoids C, R, N.

But we have to check if it's valid: yes.

However, we might also consider using a word that has two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. It's possible, but we don't have evidence.

Given that we have limited information, I think we should choose a word that uses common letters and avoids the ones we know are absent.

I'll go with ""SLATE"". But wait, we have feedback that A is present but not at position 3. In ""SLATE"", A is at position 3? Let me check: S-L-A-T-E. So A is at position 3. But we know from the feedback that A is not at position 3 in the secret word. So we cannot put A at position 3 again. Therefore, ""SLATE"" is not a good choice.

So we must avoid putting A at position 3.

Therefore, let's avoid position 3 for A.

Now, let's try to form a word with A at position 1: for example, ""ADOBE"". But that has O and B and D. But also, we don't know about these. However, ""ADOBE"" is a valid word.

But note: we have to avoid R, C, N. ""ADOBE"" has none of these.

Another common word: ""ALIKE"". But in ""ALIKE"", A is at position 1, and we have L, I, K, E. But we know E is at the end, so that's good. However, in ""ALIKE"", the last letter is E, so that's fixed. But the word is A-L-I-K-E. So A at 1, E at 5.

But we don't know if I and K are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try ""STALE"". But in ""STALE"", A is at position 3? S-T-A-L-E -> A is at position 3. We must avoid position 3 for A.

So ""STALE"" is invalid for A placement.

How about ""SAUTE"": S-A-U-T-E. A is at position 2. And we avoid position 3. Also, we get to test S, A, U, T, E. U is less common, but it's a valid word.

But we might want to use more common letters.

Another word: ""PLATE"". P-L-A-T-E -> A is at position 3 again. Not allowed.

So we need to avoid position 3 for A.

Let me think of words with A at position 1 or 2 or 4.

Position 4: for example, ""BLADE"": B-L-A-D-E -> A is at position 3? No, in ""BLADE"", the letters are: B (1), L (2), A (3), D (4), E (5). So A is at position 3. We must avoid that.

Wait, how about ""DELAY""? But ""DELAY"" ends with Y, not E.

We need the word to end with E.

Another word: ""BEIGE""? No A.

We need A.

How about ""LEASE""? L-E-A-S-E. But A is at position 3? L(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). So again position 3.

We need to avoid position 3.

Let me try to find words with A at position 1: 
  - ALONE: A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in the word (from first guess feedback: N was marked x). So we cannot use N.

  - ABASE: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). This has two A's. But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are using A at position 1 and 3. But we know that A is present (at least one), and we are avoiding position 3? Actually, we are allowed to use A at position 3 again? The feedback only said that in the first guess, A was at position 3 and it was wrong position. But it could be that the word has two A's? However, we don't know. But we are trying to get information. Also, we are using two A's, which might not be efficient.

  - AGATE: A(1), G(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). Again, two A's and A at position 3.

  - ALIVE: A(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5). This has A at 1, and avoids position 3 for A? Actually, we are putting A at 1, which is a new position. And we are not putting A at 3? But we are not using A at 3 in this word? The word has only one A at position 1. So that's acceptable.

But we have to check the letters: A, L, I, V, E. We know E is at the end. We avoid C, R, N. So ""ALIVE"" is a valid guess.

But note: we are using V, which is not very common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.

Another word: ""ABIDE"": A(1), B(2), I(3), D(4), E(5). This has A at 1, and we test B, I, D. Common letters? B and D are common.

But we don't know if the word has B, I, D.

Alternatively, ""ABOVE"": A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). Again, V is less common.

How about ""ASHES"": A(1), S(2), H(3), E(4), S(5). But the last letter is S, not E. We need the last letter to be E.

We need the word to end with E.

Another word: ""AWAKE"": A(1), W(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). This has two A's and A at position 3 again.

We are having trouble avoiding position 3? Actually, we don't have to avoid using A at position 3 in the guess, but if we do, and if the secret word has A at position 3, then we would get a ✓ for that. But in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. Therefore, if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be marked as '-' (if the secret word has only one A and it's not at 3) or if there are two A's, it might be marked as present but wrong position again? But we don't know if there are two A's.

However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to try A in a new position to get more information.

So let's try to put A at position 2.

Words with A at position 2 and ending with E:
  - VALVE: V(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). But V is repeated and not very common.
  - TABLE: T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). This is good: T, A, B, L, E. All new letters except A and E.
  - MAPLE: M(1), A(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). Also good.

Both TABLE and MAPLE are valid.

We can also try A at position 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter. Words ending with E and A at position 4: 
  - SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A is at position 3? No, in SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5). So A is at 3, not 4.
  - How about ""BLARE""? But we know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. Also, B(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> A is at 3.
  - ""GRACE"": G(1), R(2), A(3), C(4), E(5) -> again A at 3, and we cannot use R and C.

It seems difficult to have A at position 4 in a 5-letter word ending with E? Because the word structure: the fourth letter is the one before the last. So if the word ends with E, then position 4 is the fourth letter and position 5 is E.

For A to be at position 4, we would have a word like: ? ? ? A E. For example, ""PIZZA"" doesn't end with E. ""PIZZE"" is not a word. ""JAZZE"" is not a word. 

Actually, there are words: for example, ""OCTAVE"": O-C-T-A-V-E -> that's 6 letters. We need 5 letters.

Another: ""SUAVE"": S-U-A-V-E -> positions: S(1), U(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). So A is at position 3, not 4.

""GUANO"" doesn't end with E.

It's hard to find a 5-letter word ending with E that has A at position 4. So probably, A is at position 1 or 2.

Therefore, I think we should try A at position 2 to get new information.

So I'll choose ""TABLE"". It has T, A, B, L, E. We know E is at the end, so we are testing T, A, B, L in positions 1,2,3,4.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So my next guess: TABLE

But let me confirm: 
  T at 1, A at 2, B at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

We are avoiding C, R, N.

We are testing new letters: T, B, L.

This seems a good choice.

Alternatively, ""MAPLE"" is also good, but M is less common than T? T is more common.

So I'll go with ""TABLE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5 (marked ""✓"").

Key insights for the next guess:
- The word must end with ""E"".
- The word contains ""A"", but not at position 3.
- Avoid using C, R, and N.
- Test new common letters (e.g., T, B, L, S) to gather more information.

The next guess should:
- Place ""E"" at position 5.
- Include ""A"" in a new position (not position 3) to confirm its location.
- Use untried letters to maximize feedback.

A strong candidate is ""table"":
- T (new letter) at position 1.
- A at position 2 (new position for testing).
- B (new letter) at position 3.
- L (new letter) at position 4.
- E at position 5 (confirmed).

This tests common consonants and avoids known absent letters.

So using a word with common letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nWe haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, D, M, P, etc.\n\nI think TABLE is a good candidate: T, A, B, L, E. It has T and L which are common.\n\nBut note: we know A is in the word, and we are putting it at position 2. If the word has A at position 1 or 4, then we might get a \'-\' for A again, but that\'s okay because we can then narrow down.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that has A at a position we haven\'t tried, such as position 1 or 4.\n\nBut let\'s also consider: we have only one known letter (E at the end) and one known present letter (A). We need to find the other three.\n\nAnother idea: since we know E is at the end, and A is present, we can try a word that has A at position 4? For example, BLAME? But we don\'t know about B, L, M. And BLAME: B, L, A, M, E. Avoids C, R, N.\n\nBut we have to check if it\'s valid: yes.\n\nHowever, we might also consider using a word that has two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. It\'s possible, but we don\'t have evidence.\n\nGiven that we have limited information, I think we should choose a word that uses common letters and avoids the ones we know are absent.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SLATE"". But wait, we have feedback that A is present but not at position 3. In ""SLATE"", A is at position 3? Let me check: S-L-A-T-E. So A is at position 3. But we know from the feedback that A is not at position 3 in the secret word. So we cannot put A at position 3 again. Therefore, ""SLATE"" is not a good choice.\n\nSo we must avoid putting A at position 3.\n\nTherefore, let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\nNow, let\'s try to form a word with A at position 1: for example, ""ADOBE"". But that has O and B and D. But also, we don\'t know about these. However, ""ADOBE"" is a valid word.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid R, C, N. ""ADOBE"" has none of these.\n\nAnother common word: ""ALIKE"". But in ""ALIKE"", A is at position 1, and we have L, I, K, E. But we know E is at the end, so that\'s good. However, in ""ALIKE"", the last letter is E, so that\'s fixed. But the word is A-L-I-K-E. So A at 1, E at 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know if I and K are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""STALE"". But in ""STALE"", A is at position 3? S-T-A-L-E -> A is at position 3. We must avoid position 3 for A.\n\nSo ""STALE"" is invalid for A placement.\n\nHow about ""SAUTE"": S-A-U-T-E. A is at position 2. And we avoid position 3. Also, we get to test S, A, U, T, E. U is less common, but it\'s a valid word.\n\nBut we might want to use more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""PLATE"". P-L-A-T-E -> A is at position 3 again. Not allowed.\n\nSo we need to avoid position 3 for A.\n\nLet me think of words with A at position 1 or 2 or 4.\n\nPosition 4: for example, ""BLADE"": B-L-A-D-E -> A is at position 3? No, in ""BLADE"", the letters are: B (1), L (2), A (3), D (4), E (5). So A is at position 3. We must avoid that.\n\nWait, how about ""DELAY""? But ""DELAY"" ends with Y, not E.\n\nWe need the word to end with E.\n\nAnother word: ""BEIGE""? No A.\n\nWe need A.\n\nHow about ""LEASE""? L-E-A-S-E. But A is at position 3? L(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). So again position 3.\n\nWe need to avoid position 3.\n\nLet me try to find words with A at position 1: \n  - ALONE: A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in the word (from first guess feedback: N was marked x). So we cannot use N.\n\n  - ABASE: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). This has two A\'s. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we are using A at position 1 and 3. But we know that A is present (at least one), and we are avoiding position 3? Actually, we are allowed to use A at position 3 again? The feedback only said that in the first guess, A was at position 3 and it was wrong position. But it could be that the word has two A\'s? However, we don\'t know. But we are trying to get information. Also, we are using two A\'s, which might not be efficient.\n\n  - AGATE: A(1), G(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). Again, two A\'s and A at position 3.\n\n  - ALIVE: A(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5). This has A at 1, and avoids position 3 for A? Actually, we are putting A at 1, which is a new position. And we are not putting A at 3? But we are not using A at 3 in this word? The word has only one A at position 1. So that\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we have to check the letters: A, L, I, V, E. We know E is at the end. We avoid C, R, N. So ""ALIVE"" is a valid guess.\n\nBut note: we are using V, which is not very common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""ABIDE"": A(1), B(2), I(3), D(4), E(5). This has A at 1, and we test B, I, D. Common letters? B and D are common.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has B, I, D.\n\nAlternatively, ""ABOVE"": A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). Again, V is less common.\n\nHow about ""ASHES"": A(1), S(2), H(3), E(4), S(5). But the last letter is S, not E. We need the last letter to be E.\n\nWe need the word to end with E.\n\nAnother word: ""AWAKE"": A(1), W(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). This has two A\'s and A at position 3 again.\n\nWe are having trouble avoiding position 3? Actually, we don\'t have to avoid using A at position 3 in the guess, but if we do, and if the secret word has A at position 3, then we would get a ✓ for that. But in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. Therefore, if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be marked as \'-\' (if the secret word has only one A and it\'s not at 3) or if there are two A\'s, it might be marked as present but wrong position again? But we don\'t know if there are two A\'s.\n\nHowever, to avoid confusion, it might be better to try A in a new position to get more information.\n\nSo let\'s try to put A at position 2.\n\nWords with A at position 2 and ending with E:\n  - VALVE: V(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). But V is repeated and not very common.\n  - TABLE: T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). This is good: T, A, B, L, E. All new letters except A and E.\n  - MAPLE: M(1), A(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). Also good.\n\nBoth TABLE and MAPLE are valid.\n\nWe can also try A at position 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter. Words ending with E and A at position 4: \n  - SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A is at position 3? No, in SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5). So A is at 3, not 4.\n  - How about ""BLARE""? But we know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. Also, B(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> A is at 3.\n  - ""GRACE"": G(1), R(2), A(3), C(4), E(5) -> again A at 3, and we cannot use R and C.\n\nIt seems difficult to have A at position 4 in a 5-letter word ending with E? Because the word structure: the fourth letter is the one before the last. So if the word ends with E, then position 4 is the fourth letter and position 5 is E.\n\nFor A to be at position 4, we would have a word like: ? ? ? A E. For example, ""PIZZA"" doesn\'t end with E. ""PIZZE"" is not a word. ""JAZZE"" is not a word. \n\nActually, there are words: for example, ""OCTAVE"": O-C-T-A-V-E -> that\'s 6 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\nAnother: ""SUAVE"": S-U-A-V-E -> positions: S(1), U(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). So A is at position 3, not 4.\n\n""GUANO"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a 5-letter word ending with E that has A at position 4. So probably, A is at position 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, I think we should try A at position 2 to get new information.\n\nSo I\'ll choose ""TABLE"". It has T, A, B, L, E. We know E is at the end, so we are testing T, A, B, L in positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nSo my next guess: TABLE\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  T at 1, A at 2, B at 3, L at 4, E at 5.\n\nWe are avoiding C, R, N.\n\nWe are testing new letters: T, B, L.\n\nThis seems a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""MAPLE"" is also good, but M is less common than T? T is more common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""TABLE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").\n- E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5 (marked ""✓"").\n\nKey insights for the next guess:\n- The word must end with ""E"".\n- The word contains ""A"", but not at position 3.\n- Avoid using C, R, and N.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., T, B, L, S) to gather more information.\n\nThe next guess should:\n- Place ""E"" at position 5.\n- Include ""A"" in a new position (not position 3) to confirm its location.\n- Use untried letters to maximize feedback.\n\nA strong candidate is ""table"":\n- T (new letter) at position 1.\n- A at position 2 (new position for testing).\n- B (new letter) at position 3.\n- L (new letter) at position 4.\n- E at position 5 (confirmed).\n\nThis tests common consonants and avoids known absent letters.\n\n<guess>table</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: table -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; since it was in position 3, it's not at 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

Guess 2: ""table""
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 2nd letter)
- B: x (not in the word)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position; in ""table"", L was at position 4, so L is not at position 4)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

Now, we know:
- The word has the 2nd letter as A and the 5th letter as E. So the word pattern is _ A _ _ E.
- The letters C, R, N, T, B are not in the word.
- The letter L is in the word, but not at position 4.

Since we know the second letter is A and the fifth is E, we can focus on the first, third, and fourth positions.

We need to find a word that fits: _ A _ _ E

We also know that L is present, but not at position 4. So L must be at position 1 or 3.

Additionally, we have to avoid C, R, N, T, B.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, B, L. So we can try to use new common letters for the remaining positions.

The remaining positions are 1, 3, and 4. But note, position 4 is the only position we haven't placed any letter yet, and we know L is not at 4, so position 4 must be a new letter.

Since L is in the word and not at 4, it must be at 1 or 3.

Let's consider possibilities:

If L is at position 1, then the word is L A _ _ E.
If L is at position 3, then the word is _ A L _ E.

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters.

We should choose a word that tests L in one of these positions and introduces new letters for the others.

Common letters we haven't used: S, D, M, P, O, I, G, H, U, etc.

We can try to form a word that has L at position 1 and two new letters for positions 3 and 4.

For example: 
- ""LAZ?E"" but we need a 5-letter word. ""LAZEE"" is not a word. 
- ""LABS?E"" no.

Better: ""LAT?E"" but T is not in the word, so we can't use T.

We cannot use T because it was in ""table"" and marked x.

So avoid T.

How about ""LANCE""? But N is not in the word (from guess1) and C is not in the word.

Not possible.

""LARGE""? R is not in the word.

So we need to avoid used and absent letters.

Let me think of words starting with LA and ending with E, with the third and fourth letters being new and not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C, R, N, T, B.

Possible words:
- ""LAB?E"" but B is absent.
- ""LACE?"" but C is absent and E is at the end? ""LACE"" is 4 letters.

5-letter words: 
- ""LADLE"": L(1), A(2), D(3), L(4), E(5). But we have L at 1 and 4? And we know from feedback that L is not at position 4 (from guess2: L was at position 4 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning L is in the word but not at 4). So if we put L at position 4, it would be incorrect. Also, in ""LADLE"", the L at position 1 is new, but we are also putting L at position 4 which is not allowed? Actually, the feedback only said that L is not at position 4, but it might be at other positions. However, if the word has two L's, then it could be that one L is at 4? But we don't know if there are two L's.

But the feedback from guess2: for ""table"", L was at position 4 and marked as '-' meaning that there is an L in the word but not at position 4. That does not say anything about whether there could be another L. However, we don't have evidence for two L's.

Moreover, in ""LADLE"", we have L at position 1 and 4. But we are trying to test if L is at position 1. Also, we are using D.

But note: if we guess ""LADLE"", then:
- Position 1: L - if L is in the word and at position 1, it would be ✓, but if not, it might be - or x.
- Position 4: L - but we know L is not at position 4, so it would be x if there is only one L, or - if there is another L elsewhere? But we don't know.

This might be confusing. We should avoid putting L at position 4 again because we know it's not there.

So perhaps we should avoid words that have L at position 4.

Therefore, ""LADLE"" is not a good choice because it has L at position 4 which is known to be wrong.

Another word: ""LAPSE"": L(1), A(2), P(3), S(4), E(5). This avoids position 4 for L? In this word, L is at 1, and we have P and S. Also, no L at 4.

This seems good. We test L at position 1, and we test P and S.

But we know A is at 2 and E at 5, so we are only testing positions 1,3,4.

""LAPSE"" uses P and S, which are new.

Similarly, we could have ""LATTE"" but T is absent and also has T.

Not possible.

""LARVA""? R is absent and doesn't end with E.

So ""LAPSE"" is a candidate.

Now, what if L is not at position 1, but at position 3? Then the word is _ A L _ E.

We need a letter for position 1 and 4.

For example: ""SALVE"" - S(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). But we already used S? No, we haven't used S. But in guess2, we didn't use S. However, V is less common.

But ""SALVE"" is a valid word.

Another: ""HALVE"": H(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). H and V.

But V is not very common.

""PAL?E"": ""PALAE"" is not common, ""PALLE"" not a word.

""GALE"" is 4 letters.

""VALES"" ends with S, not E.

""VAL?E"": ""VALUE"" ends with E? V-A-L-U-E, so U at position 4. That's a word: VALUE.

But in ""VALUE"": V(1), A(2), L(3), U(4), E(5). So L is at position 3, and we test V and U.

But we don't know about V and U.

We could also consider ""SALLE"" but that's not a common word.

Another common word: ""MAPLE"" but we know from guess2 that in ""table"", B was absent, but M is new. However, in ""MAPLE"": M(1), A(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). But we know L is not at position 4 (from guess2 feedback). So we cannot put L at position 4. Therefore, ""MAPLE"" is invalid for L placement.

Similarly, we must avoid putting L at position 4.

So for the case where L is at position 3, we need a word with L at 3 and a new letter at 1 and 4, and avoid L at 4.

So ""SALVE"" has L at 3 and V at 4, which is fine because L is not at 4. Similarly, ""VALUE"" has L at 3 and U at 4.

But we also have the option to test L at position 1 with ""LAPSE"".

We need to choose one that uses common letters.

Since we have two possibilities for L (position 1 or 3), we can choose a word that tests one of them.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L at position 1 and also tests other common letters.

I think ""LAPSE"" is a good choice because:
- It tests L at position 1 (if L is at 1, we get ✓, if not, we get - or x, but if we get x then we know L must be at position 3).
- It introduces P and S, which are common.

If we guess ""LAPSE"":
- If L is at position 1, we get ✓ for L, and then we know the word is L A _ _ E, and we have P and S to test.
- If L is not at position 1, then we get feedback that L is present but not at 1 (so it must be at position 3, since it can't be at 4 and we have only positions 1 and 3 left for L? Actually, positions 1,3, and 4 are open, but we know L is not at 4, so only 1 or 3. So if L is not at 1, it must be at 3).

Also, we get feedback on P and S.

So it's informative.

Similarly, we could test L at position 3 with a word like ""VALUE"", but V and U are less common.

Therefore, I think ""LAPSE"" is a better choice.

But note: in ""LAPSE"", we have S at position 4. We don't know about S.

So let's go with ""LAPSE"".

But wait, we must ensure that we are not using any absent letters. Absent letters: C, R, N, T, B. ""LAPSE"" has L, A, P, S, E. None of the absent letters. Good.

So next guess: LAPSE

But let me confirm the positions:
- L at 1
- A at 2 (we know it's correct, so it should be ✓)
- P at 3
- S at 4
- E at 5 (correct)

We expect A and E to be correct, so we are mainly testing L, P, S.

If L is at 1, it will be ✓. If not, it will be - (since L is in the word but not at 1) or x? But if L is not at 1 and not at 4, then it must be at 3, so if we put L at 1 and it's actually at 3, then we would get a '-' for L? No: if L is in the word but not at position 1, then we get '-'. But if L is at position 3, then when we put L at 1, it should be marked as '-' (present but wrong position). Similarly, if L is not in the word at all, it would be x, but we know from guess2 that L is in the word (because in ""table"", L was marked as present but wrong position). So L is definitely in the word, so if not at 1, it will be '-'.

Therefore, after this guess, we will know if L is at position 1 or not.

So it's a good test.

Thus, I choose ""LAPSE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is confirmed at position 5, A is present but not at position 3, and C, R, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (table)**: A is confirmed at position 2, E is confirmed at position 5, L is present but not at position 4, and T, B are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The word pattern is `_ A _ _ E`.
- Confirmed letters: A (position 2), E (position 5), and L (present but not at position 4).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, T, B.
- L must be at position 1 or 3 (since it cannot be at position 4 and positions 2 and 5 are fixed).
- The unknown positions are 1, 3, and 4. Position 4 is open, and L must occupy position 1 or 3.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test L at position 1 to determine its location (if L is not at position 1, it must be at position 3).
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., P, S) for positions 3 and 4 to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, T, B).

The word ""lapse"" fits perfectly:
- L at position 1 (tests if L is at position 1).
- A at position 2 (confirmed, so expected ✓).
- P at position 3 (new letter test).
- S at position 4 (new letter test).
- E at position 5 (confirmed, so expected ✓).

This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities:
- If L is at position 1, we get ✓ for L and can focus on positions 3 and 4.
- If L is not at position 1 (resulting in ""-"" for L), it must be at position 3, and we get feedback on P and S.

<guess>lapse</guess>",lapse,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; since it was in position 3, it's not at 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

Guess 2: ""table""
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 2nd letter)
- B: x (not in the word)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position; in ""table"", L was at position 4, so L is not at position 4)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

Now, we know:
- The word has the 2nd letter as A and the 5th letter as E. So the word pattern is _ A _ _ E.
- The letters C, R, N, T, B are not in the word.
- The letter L is in the word, but not at position 4.

Since we know the second letter is A and the fifth is E, we can focus on the first, third, and fourth positions.

We need to find a word that fits: _ A _ _ E

We also know that L is present, but not at position 4. So L must be at position 1 or 3.

Additionally, we have to avoid C, R, N, T, B.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, B, L. So we can try to use new common letters for the remaining positions.

The remaining positions are 1, 3, and 4. But note, position 4 is the only position we haven't placed any letter yet, and we know L is not at 4, so position 4 must be a new letter.

Since L is in the word and not at 4, it must be at 1 or 3.

Let's consider possibilities:

If L is at position 1, then the word is L A _ _ E.
If L is at position 3, then the word is _ A L _ E.

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters.

We should choose a word that tests L in one of these positions and introduces new letters for the others.

Common letters we haven't used: S, D, M, P, O, I, G, H, U, etc.

We can try to form a word that has L at position 1 and two new letters for positions 3 and 4.

For example: 
- ""LAZ?E"" but we need a 5-letter word. ""LAZEE"" is not a word. 
- ""LABS?E"" no.

Better: ""LAT?E"" but T is not in the word, so we can't use T.

We cannot use T because it was in ""table"" and marked x.

So avoid T.

How about ""LANCE""? But N is not in the word (from guess1) and C is not in the word.

Not possible.

""LARGE""? R is not in the word.

So we need to avoid used and absent letters.

Let me think of words starting with LA and ending with E, with the third and fourth letters being new and not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C, R, N, T, B.

Possible words:
- ""LAB?E"" but B is absent.
- ""LACE?"" but C is absent and E is at the end? ""LACE"" is 4 letters.

5-letter words: 
- ""LADLE"": L(1), A(2), D(3), L(4), E(5). But we have L at 1 and 4? And we know from feedback that L is not at position 4 (from guess2: L was at position 4 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning L is in the word but not at 4). So if we put L at position 4, it would be incorrect. Also, in ""LADLE"", the L at position 1 is new, but we are also putting L at position 4 which is not allowed? Actually, the feedback only said that L is not at position 4, but it might be at other positions. However, if the word has two L's, then it could be that one L is at 4? But we don't know if there are two L's.

But the feedback from guess2: for ""table"", L was at position 4 and marked as '-' meaning that there is an L in the word but not at position 4. That does not say anything about whether there could be another L. However, we don't have evidence for two L's.

Moreover, in ""LADLE"", we have L at position 1 and 4. But we are trying to test if L is at position 1. Also, we are using D.

But note: if we guess ""LADLE"", then:
- Position 1: L - if L is in the word and at position 1, it would be ✓, but if not, it might be - or x.
- Position 4: L - but we know L is not at position 4, so it would be x if there is only one L, or - if there is another L elsewhere? But we don't know.

This might be confusing. We should avoid putting L at position 4 again because we know it's not there.

So perhaps we should avoid words that have L at position 4.

Therefore, ""LADLE"" is not a good choice because it has L at position 4 which is known to be wrong.

Another word: ""LAPSE"": L(1), A(2), P(3), S(4), E(5). This avoids position 4 for L? In this word, L is at 1, and we have P and S. Also, no L at 4.

This seems good. We test L at position 1, and we test P and S.

But we know A is at 2 and E at 5, so we are only testing positions 1,3,4.

""LAPSE"" uses P and S, which are new.

Similarly, we could have ""LATTE"" but T is absent and also has T.

Not possible.

""LARVA""? R is absent and doesn't end with E.

So ""LAPSE"" is a candidate.

Now, what if L is not at position 1, but at position 3? Then the word is _ A L _ E.

We need a letter for position 1 and 4.

For example: ""SALVE"" - S(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). But we already used S? No, we haven't used S. But in guess2, we didn't use S. However, V is less common.

But ""SALVE"" is a valid word.

Another: ""HALVE"": H(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). H and V.

But V is not very common.

""PAL?E"": ""PALAE"" is not common, ""PALLE"" not a word.

""GALE"" is 4 letters.

""VALES"" ends with S, not E.

""VAL?E"": ""VALUE"" ends with E? V-A-L-U-E, so U at position 4. That's a word: VALUE.

But in ""VALUE"": V(1), A(2), L(3), U(4), E(5). So L is at position 3, and we test V and U.

But we don't know about V and U.

We could also consider ""SALLE"" but that's not a common word.

Another common word: ""MAPLE"" but we know from guess2 that in ""table"", B was absent, but M is new. However, in ""MAPLE"": M(1), A(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). But we know L is not at position 4 (from guess2 feedback). So we cannot put L at position 4. Therefore, ""MAPLE"" is invalid for L placement.

Similarly, we must avoid putting L at position 4.

So for the case where L is at position 3, we need a word with L at 3 and a new letter at 1 and 4, and avoid L at 4.

So ""SALVE"" has L at 3 and V at 4, which is fine because L is not at 4. Similarly, ""VALUE"" has L at 3 and U at 4.

But we also have the option to test L at position 1 with ""LAPSE"".

We need to choose one that uses common letters.

Since we have two possibilities for L (position 1 or 3), we can choose a word that tests one of them.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L at position 1 and also tests other common letters.

I think ""LAPSE"" is a good choice because:
- It tests L at position 1 (if L is at 1, we get ✓, if not, we get - or x, but if we get x then we know L must be at position 3).
- It introduces P and S, which are common.

If we guess ""LAPSE"":
- If L is at position 1, we get ✓ for L, and then we know the word is L A _ _ E, and we have P and S to test.
- If L is not at position 1, then we get feedback that L is present but not at 1 (so it must be at position 3, since it can't be at 4 and we have only positions 1 and 3 left for L? Actually, positions 1,3, and 4 are open, but we know L is not at 4, so only 1 or 3. So if L is not at 1, it must be at 3).

Also, we get feedback on P and S.

So it's informative.

Similarly, we could test L at position 3 with a word like ""VALUE"", but V and U are less common.

Therefore, I think ""LAPSE"" is a better choice.

But note: in ""LAPSE"", we have S at position 4. We don't know about S.

So let's go with ""LAPSE"".

But wait, we must ensure that we are not using any absent letters. Absent letters: C, R, N, T, B. ""LAPSE"" has L, A, P, S, E. None of the absent letters. Good.

So next guess: LAPSE

But let me confirm the positions:
- L at 1
- A at 2 (we know it's correct, so it should be ✓)
- P at 3
- S at 4
- E at 5 (correct)

We expect A and E to be correct, so we are mainly testing L, P, S.

If L is at 1, it will be ✓. If not, it will be - (since L is in the word but not at 1) or x? But if L is not at 1 and not at 4, then it must be at 3, so if we put L at 1 and it's actually at 3, then we would get a '-' for L? No: if L is in the word but not at position 1, then we get '-'. But if L is at position 3, then when we put L at 1, it should be marked as '-' (present but wrong position). Similarly, if L is not in the word at all, it would be x, but we know from guess2 that L is in the word (because in ""table"", L was marked as present but wrong position). So L is definitely in the word, so if not at 1, it will be '-'.

Therefore, after this guess, we will know if L is at position 1 or not.

So it's a good test.

Thus, I choose ""LAPSE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is confirmed at position 5, A is present but not at position 3, and C, R, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (table)**: A is confirmed at position 2, E is confirmed at position 5, L is present but not at position 4, and T, B are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The word pattern is `_ A _ _ E`.
- Confirmed letters: A (position 2), E (position 5), and L (present but not at position 4).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, T, B.
- L must be at position 1 or 3 (since it cannot be at position 4 and positions 2 and 5 are fixed).
- The unknown positions are 1, 3, and 4. Position 4 is open, and L must occupy position 1 or 3.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test L at position 1 to determine its location (if L is not at position 1, it must be at position 3).
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., P, S) for positions 3 and 4 to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, T, B).

The word ""lapse"" fits perfectly:
- L at position 1 (tests if L is at position 1).
- A at position 2 (confirmed, so expected ✓).
- P at position 3 (new letter test).
- S at position 4 (new letter test).
- E at position 5 (confirmed, so expected ✓).

This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities:
- If L is at position 1, we get ✓ for L and can focus on positions 3 and 4.
- If L is not at position 1 (resulting in ""-"" for L), it must be at position 3, and we get feedback on P and S.",Guess 3: lapse -> FEEDBACK: L(-) A(✓) P(x) S(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,value,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter)

Therefore, we know:
  The word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
  The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A was the third letter, but it's marked as present but wrong position).
  The letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

We can use this information to make the next guess.

We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
  - Ends with E (since E is confirmed at position 5)
  - Contains the letter A (but not at position 3? Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not at the position we guessed, which was position 3. So A could be at position 1, 2, 4, or even 5? But position 5 is E, so A cannot be at 5. Also, note that A is present, so we must include it, but not at position 3.
  - Avoids the letters C, R, and N.

Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that end with E and contain A, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters we haven't tried: We have tried C, R, A, N, E. So we can use other vowels and consonants.

We know A is in the word, so we should try to place A in a different position (not position 3). Also, we can try to include other common letters like T, S, L, I, O, etc.

Possible positions for A: since it's not at position 3, and we know position 5 is E, we can try A at position 1, 2, or 4.

Let's try to think of words that end with E and have A in one of these positions.

Some examples:
  - A at position 1: words like ABASE, ABATE, ADAGE, etc. But we must avoid C, R, N.
  - A at position 2: words like SALVE, TABLE, etc.
  - A at position 4: words like BLARE, SCALE, but we must avoid C and R? Wait, we know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. Similarly, C is not in the word.

But note: we must avoid R and C and N.

Let me try to list words without C, R, N, ending with E, and containing A.

Possibilities:
  - A at position 1: ABATE, ADAGE, AGATE, ALATE, AMAZE, etc.
  - A at position 2: SALVE, VALVE, WAFTE (not a word), TABLE, MAPLE, etc.
  - A at position 4: BLADE? But we have to avoid R? BLADE has no R, but it has B, L, D. Also, we don't know about these.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more feedback.

Let me consider: SALVE? But we don't know if S, L, V are in the word. Also, note that in SALVE, A is at position 2.

But we have to avoid R? SALVE has no R? Actually, SALVE: S, A, L, V, E. No R, no C, no N. So that's acceptable.

However, we have to check if it's a valid word. Yes, SALVE is a word.

Another option: TABLE. T, A, B, L, E. Also avoids C, R, N.

But note: we have E at the end, and A at position 2.

We could also try to put A at position 1: for example, AGAPE? But that has G and P.

We want to maximize information. So using a word with common letters that we haven't tried yet.

We haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, D, M, P, etc.

I think TABLE is a good candidate: T, A, B, L, E. It has T and L which are common.

But note: we know A is in the word, and we are putting it at position 2. If the word has A at position 1 or 4, then we might get a '-' for A again, but that's okay because we can then narrow down.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has A at a position we haven't tried, such as position 1 or 4.

But let's also consider: we have only one known letter (E at the end) and one known present letter (A). We need to find the other three.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, and A is present, we can try a word that has A at position 4? For example, BLAME? But we don't know about B, L, M. And BLAME: B, L, A, M, E. Avoids C, R, N.

But we have to check if it's valid: yes.

However, we might also consider using a word that has two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. It's possible, but we don't have evidence.

Given that we have limited information, I think we should choose a word that uses common letters and avoids the ones we know are absent.

I'll go with ""SLATE"". But wait, we have feedback that A is present but not at position 3. In ""SLATE"", A is at position 3? Let me check: S-L-A-T-E. So A is at position 3. But we know from the feedback that A is not at position 3 in the secret word. So we cannot put A at position 3 again. Therefore, ""SLATE"" is not a good choice.

So we must avoid putting A at position 3.

Therefore, let's avoid position 3 for A.

Now, let's try to form a word with A at position 1: for example, ""ADOBE"". But that has O and B and D. But also, we don't know about these. However, ""ADOBE"" is a valid word.

But note: we have to avoid R, C, N. ""ADOBE"" has none of these.

Another common word: ""ALIKE"". But in ""ALIKE"", A is at position 1, and we have L, I, K, E. But we know E is at the end, so that's good. However, in ""ALIKE"", the last letter is E, so that's fixed. But the word is A-L-I-K-E. So A at 1, E at 5.

But we don't know if I and K are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try ""STALE"". But in ""STALE"", A is at position 3? S-T-A-L-E -> A is at position 3. We must avoid position 3 for A.

So ""STALE"" is invalid for A placement.

How about ""SAUTE"": S-A-U-T-E. A is at position 2. And we avoid position 3. Also, we get to test S, A, U, T, E. U is less common, but it's a valid word.

But we might want to use more common letters.

Another word: ""PLATE"". P-L-A-T-E -> A is at position 3 again. Not allowed.

So we need to avoid position 3 for A.

Let me think of words with A at position 1 or 2 or 4.

Position 4: for example, ""BLADE"": B-L-A-D-E -> A is at position 3? No, in ""BLADE"", the letters are: B (1), L (2), A (3), D (4), E (5). So A is at position 3. We must avoid that.

Wait, how about ""DELAY""? But ""DELAY"" ends with Y, not E.

We need the word to end with E.

Another word: ""BEIGE""? No A.

We need A.

How about ""LEASE""? L-E-A-S-E. But A is at position 3? L(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). So again position 3.

We need to avoid position 3.

Let me try to find words with A at position 1: 
  - ALONE: A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in the word (from first guess feedback: N was marked x). So we cannot use N.

  - ABASE: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). This has two A's. But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are using A at position 1 and 3. But we know that A is present (at least one), and we are avoiding position 3? Actually, we are allowed to use A at position 3 again? The feedback only said that in the first guess, A was at position 3 and it was wrong position. But it could be that the word has two A's? However, we don't know. But we are trying to get information. Also, we are using two A's, which might not be efficient.

  - AGATE: A(1), G(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). Again, two A's and A at position 3.

  - ALIVE: A(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5). This has A at 1, and avoids position 3 for A? Actually, we are putting A at 1, which is a new position. And we are not putting A at 3? But we are not using A at 3 in this word? The word has only one A at position 1. So that's acceptable.

But we have to check the letters: A, L, I, V, E. We know E is at the end. We avoid C, R, N. So ""ALIVE"" is a valid guess.

But note: we are using V, which is not very common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.

Another word: ""ABIDE"": A(1), B(2), I(3), D(4), E(5). This has A at 1, and we test B, I, D. Common letters? B and D are common.

But we don't know if the word has B, I, D.

Alternatively, ""ABOVE"": A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). Again, V is less common.

How about ""ASHES"": A(1), S(2), H(3), E(4), S(5). But the last letter is S, not E. We need the last letter to be E.

We need the word to end with E.

Another word: ""AWAKE"": A(1), W(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). This has two A's and A at position 3 again.

We are having trouble avoiding position 3? Actually, we don't have to avoid using A at position 3 in the guess, but if we do, and if the secret word has A at position 3, then we would get a ✓ for that. But in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. Therefore, if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be marked as '-' (if the secret word has only one A and it's not at 3) or if there are two A's, it might be marked as present but wrong position again? But we don't know if there are two A's.

However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to try A in a new position to get more information.

So let's try to put A at position 2.

Words with A at position 2 and ending with E:
  - VALVE: V(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). But V is repeated and not very common.
  - TABLE: T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). This is good: T, A, B, L, E. All new letters except A and E.
  - MAPLE: M(1), A(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). Also good.

Both TABLE and MAPLE are valid.

We can also try A at position 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter. Words ending with E and A at position 4: 
  - SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A is at position 3? No, in SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5). So A is at 3, not 4.
  - How about ""BLARE""? But we know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. Also, B(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> A is at 3.
  - ""GRACE"": G(1), R(2), A(3), C(4), E(5) -> again A at 3, and we cannot use R and C.

It seems difficult to have A at position 4 in a 5-letter word ending with E? Because the word structure: the fourth letter is the one before the last. So if the word ends with E, then position 4 is the fourth letter and position 5 is E.

For A to be at position 4, we would have a word like: ? ? ? A E. For example, ""PIZZA"" doesn't end with E. ""PIZZE"" is not a word. ""JAZZE"" is not a word. 

Actually, there are words: for example, ""OCTAVE"": O-C-T-A-V-E -> that's 6 letters. We need 5 letters.

Another: ""SUAVE"": S-U-A-V-E -> positions: S(1), U(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). So A is at position 3, not 4.

""GUANO"" doesn't end with E.

It's hard to find a 5-letter word ending with E that has A at position 4. So probably, A is at position 1 or 2.

Therefore, I think we should try A at position 2 to get new information.

So I'll choose ""TABLE"". It has T, A, B, L, E. We know E is at the end, so we are testing T, A, B, L in positions 1,2,3,4.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So my next guess: TABLE

But let me confirm: 
  T at 1, A at 2, B at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

We are avoiding C, R, N.

We are testing new letters: T, B, L.

This seems a good choice.

Alternatively, ""MAPLE"" is also good, but M is less common than T? T is more common.

So I'll go with ""TABLE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5 (marked ""✓"").

Key insights for the next guess:
- The word must end with ""E"".
- The word contains ""A"", but not at position 3.
- Avoid using C, R, and N.
- Test new common letters (e.g., T, B, L, S) to gather more information.

The next guess should:
- Place ""E"" at position 5.
- Include ""A"" in a new position (not position 3) to confirm its location.
- Use untried letters to maximize feedback.

A strong candidate is ""table"":
- T (new letter) at position 1.
- A at position 2 (new position for testing).
- B (new letter) at position 3.
- L (new letter) at position 4.
- E at position 5 (confirmed).

This tests common consonants and avoids known absent letters.

<guess>table</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: table -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; since it was in position 3, it's not at 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

Guess 2: ""table""
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 2nd letter)
- B: x (not in the word)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position; in ""table"", L was at position 4, so L is not at position 4)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

Now, we know:
- The word has the 2nd letter as A and the 5th letter as E. So the word pattern is _ A _ _ E.
- The letters C, R, N, T, B are not in the word.
- The letter L is in the word, but not at position 4.

Since we know the second letter is A and the fifth is E, we can focus on the first, third, and fourth positions.

We need to find a word that fits: _ A _ _ E

We also know that L is present, but not at position 4. So L must be at position 1 or 3.

Additionally, we have to avoid C, R, N, T, B.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, B, L. So we can try to use new common letters for the remaining positions.

The remaining positions are 1, 3, and 4. But note, position 4 is the only position we haven't placed any letter yet, and we know L is not at 4, so position 4 must be a new letter.

Since L is in the word and not at 4, it must be at 1 or 3.

Let's consider possibilities:

If L is at position 1, then the word is L A _ _ E.
If L is at position 3, then the word is _ A L _ E.

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters.

We should choose a word that tests L in one of these positions and introduces new letters for the others.

Common letters we haven't used: S, D, M, P, O, I, G, H, U, etc.

We can try to form a word that has L at position 1 and two new letters for positions 3 and 4.

For example: 
- ""LAZ?E"" but we need a 5-letter word. ""LAZEE"" is not a word. 
- ""LABS?E"" no.

Better: ""LAT?E"" but T is not in the word, so we can't use T.

We cannot use T because it was in ""table"" and marked x.

So avoid T.

How about ""LANCE""? But N is not in the word (from guess1) and C is not in the word.

Not possible.

""LARGE""? R is not in the word.

So we need to avoid used and absent letters.

Let me think of words starting with LA and ending with E, with the third and fourth letters being new and not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C, R, N, T, B.

Possible words:
- ""LAB?E"" but B is absent.
- ""LACE?"" but C is absent and E is at the end? ""LACE"" is 4 letters.

5-letter words: 
- ""LADLE"": L(1), A(2), D(3), L(4), E(5). But we have L at 1 and 4? And we know from feedback that L is not at position 4 (from guess2: L was at position 4 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning L is in the word but not at 4). So if we put L at position 4, it would be incorrect. Also, in ""LADLE"", the L at position 1 is new, but we are also putting L at position 4 which is not allowed? Actually, the feedback only said that L is not at position 4, but it might be at other positions. However, if the word has two L's, then it could be that one L is at 4? But we don't know if there are two L's.

But the feedback from guess2: for ""table"", L was at position 4 and marked as '-' meaning that there is an L in the word but not at position 4. That does not say anything about whether there could be another L. However, we don't have evidence for two L's.

Moreover, in ""LADLE"", we have L at position 1 and 4. But we are trying to test if L is at position 1. Also, we are using D.

But note: if we guess ""LADLE"", then:
- Position 1: L - if L is in the word and at position 1, it would be ✓, but if not, it might be - or x.
- Position 4: L - but we know L is not at position 4, so it would be x if there is only one L, or - if there is another L elsewhere? But we don't know.

This might be confusing. We should avoid putting L at position 4 again because we know it's not there.

So perhaps we should avoid words that have L at position 4.

Therefore, ""LADLE"" is not a good choice because it has L at position 4 which is known to be wrong.

Another word: ""LAPSE"": L(1), A(2), P(3), S(4), E(5). This avoids position 4 for L? In this word, L is at 1, and we have P and S. Also, no L at 4.

This seems good. We test L at position 1, and we test P and S.

But we know A is at 2 and E at 5, so we are only testing positions 1,3,4.

""LAPSE"" uses P and S, which are new.

Similarly, we could have ""LATTE"" but T is absent and also has T.

Not possible.

""LARVA""? R is absent and doesn't end with E.

So ""LAPSE"" is a candidate.

Now, what if L is not at position 1, but at position 3? Then the word is _ A L _ E.

We need a letter for position 1 and 4.

For example: ""SALVE"" - S(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). But we already used S? No, we haven't used S. But in guess2, we didn't use S. However, V is less common.

But ""SALVE"" is a valid word.

Another: ""HALVE"": H(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). H and V.

But V is not very common.

""PAL?E"": ""PALAE"" is not common, ""PALLE"" not a word.

""GALE"" is 4 letters.

""VALES"" ends with S, not E.

""VAL?E"": ""VALUE"" ends with E? V-A-L-U-E, so U at position 4. That's a word: VALUE.

But in ""VALUE"": V(1), A(2), L(3), U(4), E(5). So L is at position 3, and we test V and U.

But we don't know about V and U.

We could also consider ""SALLE"" but that's not a common word.

Another common word: ""MAPLE"" but we know from guess2 that in ""table"", B was absent, but M is new. However, in ""MAPLE"": M(1), A(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). But we know L is not at position 4 (from guess2 feedback). So we cannot put L at position 4. Therefore, ""MAPLE"" is invalid for L placement.

Similarly, we must avoid putting L at position 4.

So for the case where L is at position 3, we need a word with L at 3 and a new letter at 1 and 4, and avoid L at 4.

So ""SALVE"" has L at 3 and V at 4, which is fine because L is not at 4. Similarly, ""VALUE"" has L at 3 and U at 4.

But we also have the option to test L at position 1 with ""LAPSE"".

We need to choose one that uses common letters.

Since we have two possibilities for L (position 1 or 3), we can choose a word that tests one of them.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L at position 1 and also tests other common letters.

I think ""LAPSE"" is a good choice because:
- It tests L at position 1 (if L is at 1, we get ✓, if not, we get - or x, but if we get x then we know L must be at position 3).
- It introduces P and S, which are common.

If we guess ""LAPSE"":
- If L is at position 1, we get ✓ for L, and then we know the word is L A _ _ E, and we have P and S to test.
- If L is not at position 1, then we get feedback that L is present but not at 1 (so it must be at position 3, since it can't be at 4 and we have only positions 1 and 3 left for L? Actually, positions 1,3, and 4 are open, but we know L is not at 4, so only 1 or 3. So if L is not at 1, it must be at 3).

Also, we get feedback on P and S.

So it's informative.

Similarly, we could test L at position 3 with a word like ""VALUE"", but V and U are less common.

Therefore, I think ""LAPSE"" is a better choice.

But note: in ""LAPSE"", we have S at position 4. We don't know about S.

So let's go with ""LAPSE"".

But wait, we must ensure that we are not using any absent letters. Absent letters: C, R, N, T, B. ""LAPSE"" has L, A, P, S, E. None of the absent letters. Good.

So next guess: LAPSE

But let me confirm the positions:
- L at 1
- A at 2 (we know it's correct, so it should be ✓)
- P at 3
- S at 4
- E at 5 (correct)

We expect A and E to be correct, so we are mainly testing L, P, S.

If L is at 1, it will be ✓. If not, it will be - (since L is in the word but not at 1) or x? But if L is not at 1 and not at 4, then it must be at 3, so if we put L at 1 and it's actually at 3, then we would get a '-' for L? No: if L is in the word but not at position 1, then we get '-'. But if L is at position 3, then when we put L at 1, it should be marked as '-' (present but wrong position). Similarly, if L is not in the word at all, it would be x, but we know from guess2 that L is in the word (because in ""table"", L was marked as present but wrong position). So L is definitely in the word, so if not at 1, it will be '-'.

Therefore, after this guess, we will know if L is at position 1 or not.

So it's a good test.

Thus, I choose ""LAPSE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is confirmed at position 5, A is present but not at position 3, and C, R, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (table)**: A is confirmed at position 2, E is confirmed at position 5, L is present but not at position 4, and T, B are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The word pattern is `_ A _ _ E`.
- Confirmed letters: A (position 2), E (position 5), and L (present but not at position 4).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, T, B.
- L must be at position 1 or 3 (since it cannot be at position 4 and positions 2 and 5 are fixed).
- The unknown positions are 1, 3, and 4. Position 4 is open, and L must occupy position 1 or 3.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test L at position 1 to determine its location (if L is not at position 1, it must be at position 3).
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., P, S) for positions 3 and 4 to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, T, B).

The word ""lapse"" fits perfectly:
- L at position 1 (tests if L is at position 1).
- A at position 2 (confirmed, so expected ✓).
- P at position 3 (new letter test).
- S at position 4 (new letter test).
- E at position 5 (confirmed, so expected ✓).

This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities:
- If L is at position 1, we get ✓ for L and can focus on positions 3 and 4.
- If L is not at position 1 (resulting in ""-"" for L), it must be at position 3, and we get feedback on P and S.

Also, we can try to include other common letters like T, S, L, I, O, etc.\n\nPossible positions for A: since it\'s not at position 3, and we know position 5 is E, we can try A at position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that end with E and have A in one of these positions.\n\nSome examples:\n  - A at position 1: words like ABASE, ABATE, ADAGE, etc. But we must avoid C, R, N.\n  - A at position 2: words like SALVE, TABLE, etc.\n  - A at position 4: words like BLARE, SCALE, but we must avoid C and R? Wait, we know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. Similarly, C is not in the word.\n\nBut note: we must avoid R and C and N.\n\nLet me try to list words without C, R, N, ending with E, and containing A.\n\nPossibilities:\n  - A at position 1: ABATE, ADAGE, AGATE, ALATE, AMAZE, etc.\n  - A at position 2: SALVE, VALVE, WAFTE (not a word), TABLE, MAPLE, etc.\n  - A at position 4: BLADE? But we have to avoid R? BLADE has no R, but it has B, L, D. Also, we don\'t know about these.\n\nWe also want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more feedback.\n\nLet me consider: SALVE? But we don\'t know if S, L, V are in the word. Also, note that in SALVE, A is at position 2.\n\nBut we have to avoid R? SALVE has no R? Actually, SALVE: S, A, L, V, E. No R, no C, no N. So that\'s acceptable.\n\nHowever, we have to check if it\'s a valid word. Yes, SALVE is a word.\n\nAnother option: TABLE. T, A, B, L, E. Also avoids C, R, N.\n\nBut note: we have E at the end, and A at position 2.\n\nWe could also try to put A at position 1: for example, AGAPE? But that has G and P.\n\nWe want to maximize information. So using a word with common letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nWe haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, D, M, P, etc.\n\nI think TABLE is a good candidate: T, A, B, L, E. It has T and L which are common.\n\nBut note: we know A is in the word, and we are putting it at position 2. If the word has A at position 1 or 4, then we might get a \'-\' for A again, but that\'s okay because we can then narrow down.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that has A at a position we haven\'t tried, such as position 1 or 4.\n\nBut let\'s also consider: we have only one known letter (E at the end) and one known present letter (A). We need to find the other three.\n\nAnother idea: since we know E is at the end, and A is present, we can try a word that has A at position 4? For example, BLAME? But we don\'t know about B, L, M. And BLAME: B, L, A, M, E. Avoids C, R, N.\n\nBut we have to check if it\'s valid: yes.\n\nHowever, we might also consider using a word that has two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. It\'s possible, but we don\'t have evidence.\n\nGiven that we have limited information, I think we should choose a word that uses common letters and avoids the ones we know are absent.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SLATE"". But wait, we have feedback that A is present but not at position 3. In ""SLATE"", A is at position 3? Let me check: S-L-A-T-E. So A is at position 3. But we know from the feedback that A is not at position 3 in the secret word. So we cannot put A at position 3 again. Therefore, ""SLATE"" is not a good choice.\n\nSo we must avoid putting A at position 3.\n\nTherefore, let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\nNow, let\'s try to form a word with A at position 1: for example, ""ADOBE"". But that has O and B and D. But also, we don\'t know about these. However, ""ADOBE"" is a valid word.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid R, C, N. ""ADOBE"" has none of these.\n\nAnother common word: ""ALIKE"". But in ""ALIKE"", A is at position 1, and we have L, I, K, E. But we know E is at the end, so that\'s good. However, in ""ALIKE"", the last letter is E, so that\'s fixed. But the word is A-L-I-K-E. So A at 1, E at 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know if I and K are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""STALE"". But in ""STALE"", A is at position 3? S-T-A-L-E -> A is at position 3. We must avoid position 3 for A.\n\nSo ""STALE"" is invalid for A placement.\n\nHow about ""SAUTE"": S-A-U-T-E. A is at position 2. And we avoid position 3. Also, we get to test S, A, U, T, E. U is less common, but it\'s a valid word.\n\nBut we might want to use more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""PLATE"". P-L-A-T-E -> A is at position 3 again. Not allowed.\n\nSo we need to avoid position 3 for A.\n\nLet me think of words with A at position 1 or 2 or 4.\n\nPosition 4: for example, ""BLADE"": B-L-A-D-E -> A is at position 3? No, in ""BLADE"", the letters are: B (1), L (2), A (3), D (4), E (5). So A is at position 3. We must avoid that.\n\nWait, how about ""DELAY""? But ""DELAY"" ends with Y, not E.\n\nWe need the word to end with E.\n\nAnother word: ""BEIGE""? No A.\n\nWe need A.\n\nHow about ""LEASE""? L-E-A-S-E. But A is at position 3? L(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). So again position 3.\n\nWe need to avoid position 3.\n\nLet me try to find words with A at position 1: \n  - ALONE: A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not in the word (from first guess feedback: N was marked x). So we cannot use N.\n\n  - ABASE: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). This has two A\'s. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we are using A at position 1 and 3. But we know that A is present (at least one), and we are avoiding position 3? Actually, we are allowed to use A at position 3 again? The feedback only said that in the first guess, A was at position 3 and it was wrong position. But it could be that the word has two A\'s? However, we don\'t know. But we are trying to get information. Also, we are using two A\'s, which might not be efficient.\n\n  - AGATE: A(1), G(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). Again, two A\'s and A at position 3.\n\n  - ALIVE: A(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5). This has A at 1, and avoids position 3 for A? Actually, we are putting A at 1, which is a new position. And we are not putting A at 3? But we are not using A at 3 in this word? The word has only one A at position 1. So that\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we have to check the letters: A, L, I, V, E. We know E is at the end. We avoid C, R, N. So ""ALIVE"" is a valid guess.\n\nBut note: we are using V, which is not very common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""ABIDE"": A(1), B(2), I(3), D(4), E(5). This has A at 1, and we test B, I, D. Common letters? B and D are common.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has B, I, D.\n\nAlternatively, ""ABOVE"": A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). Again, V is less common.\n\nHow about ""ASHES"": A(1), S(2), H(3), E(4), S(5). But the last letter is S, not E. We need the last letter to be E.\n\nWe need the word to end with E.\n\nAnother word: ""AWAKE"": A(1), W(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). This has two A\'s and A at position 3 again.\n\nWe are having trouble avoiding position 3? Actually, we don\'t have to avoid using A at position 3 in the guess, but if we do, and if the secret word has A at position 3, then we would get a ✓ for that. But in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. Therefore, if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be marked as \'-\' (if the secret word has only one A and it\'s not at 3) or if there are two A\'s, it might be marked as present but wrong position again? But we don\'t know if there are two A\'s.\n\nHowever, to avoid confusion, it might be better to try A in a new position to get more information.\n\nSo let\'s try to put A at position 2.\n\nWords with A at position 2 and ending with E:\n  - VALVE: V(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). But V is repeated and not very common.\n  - TABLE: T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). This is good: T, A, B, L, E. All new letters except A and E.\n  - MAPLE: M(1), A(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). Also good.\n\nBoth TABLE and MAPLE are valid.\n\nWe can also try A at position 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter. Words ending with E and A at position 4: \n  - SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) -> A is at position 3? No, in SHADE: S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5). So A is at 3, not 4.\n  - How about ""BLARE""? But we know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. Also, B(1), L(2), A(3), R(4), E(5) -> A is at 3.\n  - ""GRACE"": G(1), R(2), A(3), C(4), E(5) -> again A at 3, and we cannot use R and C.\n\nIt seems difficult to have A at position 4 in a 5-letter word ending with E? Because the word structure: the fourth letter is the one before the last. So if the word ends with E, then position 4 is the fourth letter and position 5 is E.\n\nFor A to be at position 4, we would have a word like: ? ? ? A E. For example, ""PIZZA"" doesn\'t end with E. ""PIZZE"" is not a word. ""JAZZE"" is not a word. \n\nActually, there are words: for example, ""OCTAVE"": O-C-T-A-V-E -> that\'s 6 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\nAnother: ""SUAVE"": S-U-A-V-E -> positions: S(1), U(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). So A is at position 3, not 4.\n\n""GUANO"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a 5-letter word ending with E that has A at position 4. So probably, A is at position 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, I think we should try A at position 2 to get new information.\n\nSo I\'ll choose ""TABLE"". It has T, A, B, L, E. We know E is at the end, so we are testing T, A, B, L in positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nSo my next guess: TABLE\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  T at 1, A at 2, B at 3, L at 4, E at 5.\n\nWe are avoiding C, R, N.\n\nWe are testing new letters: T, B, L.\n\nThis seems a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""MAPLE"" is also good, but M is less common than T? T is more common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""TABLE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").\n- E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5 (marked ""✓"").\n\nKey insights for the next guess:\n- The word must end with ""E"".\n- The word contains ""A"", but not at position 3.\n- Avoid using C, R, and N.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., T, B, L, S) to gather more information.\n\nThe next guess should:\n- Place ""E"" at position 5.\n- Include ""A"" in a new position (not position 3) to confirm its location.\n- Use untried letters to maximize feedback.\n\nA strong candidate is ""table"":\n- T (new letter) at position 1.\n- A at position 2 (new position for testing).\n- B (new letter) at position 3.\n- L (new letter) at position 4.\n- E at position 5 (confirmed).\n\nThis tests common consonants and avoids known absent letters.\n\n<guess>table</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: table -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position; since it was in position 3, it\'s not at 3)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)\n\nGuess 2: ""table""\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 2nd letter)\n- B: x (not in the word)\n- L: - (in the word but wrong position; in ""table"", L was at position 4, so L is not at position 4)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)\n\nNow, we know:\n- The word has the 2nd letter as A and the 5th letter as E. So the word pattern is _ A _ _ E.\n- The letters C, R, N, T, B are not in the word.\n- The letter L is in the word, but not at position 4.\n\nSince we know the second letter is A and the fifth is E, we can focus on the first, third, and fourth positions.\n\nWe need to find a word that fits: _ A _ _ E\n\nWe also know that L is present, but not at position 4. So L must be at position 1 or 3.\n\nAdditionally, we have to avoid C, R, N, T, B.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, B, L. So we can try to use new common letters for the remaining positions.\n\nThe remaining positions are 1, 3, and 4. But note, position 4 is the only position we haven\'t placed any letter yet, and we know L is not at 4, so position 4 must be a new letter.\n\nSince L is in the word and not at 4, it must be at 1 or 3.\n\nLet\'s consider possibilities:\n\nIf L is at position 1, then the word is L A _ _ E.\nIf L is at position 3, then the word is _ A L _ E.\n\nWe also need to fill the other positions with new letters.\n\nWe should choose a word that tests L in one of these positions and introduces new letters for the others.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t used: S, D, M, P, O, I, G, H, U, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word that has L at position 1 and two new letters for positions 3 and 4.\n\nFor example: \n- ""LAZ?E"" but we need a 5-letter word. ""LAZEE"" is not a word. \n- ""LABS?E"" no.\n\nBetter: ""LAT?E"" but T is not in the word, so we can\'t use T.\n\nWe cannot use T because it was in ""table"" and marked x.\n\nSo avoid T.\n\nHow about ""LANCE""? But N is not in the word (from guess1) and C is not in the word.\n\nNot possible.\n\n""LARGE""? R is not in the word.\n\nSo we need to avoid used and absent letters.\n\nLet me think of words starting with LA and ending with E, with the third and fourth letters being new and not in the absent list.\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, N, T, B.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""LAB?E"" but B is absent.\n- ""LACE?"" but C is absent and E is at the end? ""LACE"" is 4 letters.\n\n5-letter words: \n- ""LADLE"": L(1), A(2), D(3), L(4), E(5). But we have L at 1 and 4? And we know from feedback that L is not at position 4 (from guess2: L was at position 4 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning L is in the word but not at 4). So if we put L at position 4, it would be incorrect. Also, in ""LADLE"", the L at position 1 is new, but we are also putting L at position 4 which is not allowed? Actually, the feedback only said that L is not at position 4, but it might be at other positions. However, if the word has two L\'s, then it could be that one L is at 4? But we don\'t know if there are two L\'s.\n\nBut the feedback from guess2: for ""table"", L was at position 4 and marked as \'-\' meaning that there is an L in the word but not at position 4. That does not say anything about whether there could be another L. However, we don\'t have evidence for two L\'s.\n\nMoreover, in ""LADLE"", we have L at position 1 and 4. But we are trying to test if L is at position 1. Also, we are using D.\n\nBut note: if we guess ""LADLE"", then:\n- Position 1: L - if L is in the word and at position 1, it would be ✓, but if not, it might be - or x.\n- Position 4: L - but we know L is not at position 4, so it would be x if there is only one L, or - if there is another L elsewhere? But we don\'t know.\n\nThis might be confusing. We should avoid putting L at position 4 again because we know it\'s not there.\n\nSo perhaps we should avoid words that have L at position 4.\n\nTherefore, ""LADLE"" is not a good choice because it has L at position 4 which is known to be wrong.\n\nAnother word: ""LAPSE"": L(1), A(2), P(3), S(4), E(5). This avoids position 4 for L? In this word, L is at 1, and we have P and S. Also, no L at 4.\n\nThis seems good. We test L at position 1, and we test P and S.\n\nBut we know A is at 2 and E at 5, so we are only testing positions 1,3,4.\n\n""LAPSE"" uses P and S, which are new.\n\nSimilarly, we could have ""LATTE"" but T is absent and also has T.\n\nNot possible.\n\n""LARVA""? R is absent and doesn\'t end with E.\n\nSo ""LAPSE"" is a candidate.\n\nNow, what if L is not at position 1, but at position 3? Then the word is _ A L _ E.\n\nWe need a letter for position 1 and 4.\n\nFor example: ""SALVE"" - S(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). But we already used S? No, we haven\'t used S. But in guess2, we didn\'t use S. However, V is less common.\n\nBut ""SALVE"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""HALVE"": H(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). H and V.\n\nBut V is not very common.\n\n""PAL?E"": ""PALAE"" is not common, ""PALLE"" not a word.\n\n""GALE"" is 4 letters.\n\n""VALES"" ends with S, not E.\n\n""VAL?E"": ""VALUE"" ends with E? V-A-L-U-E, so U at position 4. That\'s a word: VALUE.\n\nBut in ""VALUE"": V(1), A(2), L(3), U(4), E(5). So L is at position 3, and we test V and U.\n\nBut we don\'t know about V and U.\n\nWe could also consider ""SALLE"" but that\'s not a common word.\n\nAnother common word: ""MAPLE"" but we know from guess2 that in ""table"", B was absent, but M is new. However, in ""MAPLE"": M(1), A(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). But we know L is not at position 4 (from guess2 feedback). So we cannot put L at position 4. Therefore, ""MAPLE"" is invalid for L placement.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid putting L at position 4.\n\nSo for the case where L is at position 3, we need a word with L at 3 and a new letter at 1 and 4, and avoid L at 4.\n\nSo ""SALVE"" has L at 3 and V at 4, which is fine because L is not at 4. Similarly, ""VALUE"" has L at 3 and U at 4.\n\nBut we also have the option to test L at position 1 with ""LAPSE"".\n\nWe need to choose one that uses common letters.\n\nSince we have two possibilities for L (position 1 or 3), we can choose a word that tests one of them.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has L at position 1 and also tests other common letters.\n\nI think ""LAPSE"" is a good choice because:\n- It tests L at position 1 (if L is at 1, we get ✓, if not, we get - or x, but if we get x then we know L must be at position 3).\n- It introduces P and S, which are common.\n\nIf we guess ""LAPSE"":\n- If L is at position 1, we get ✓ for L, and then we know the word is L A _ _ E, and we have P and S to test.\n- If L is not at position 1, then we get feedback that L is present but not at 1 (so it must be at position 3, since it can\'t be at 4 and we have only positions 1 and 3 left for L? Actually, positions 1,3, and 4 are open, but we know L is not at 4, so only 1 or 3. So if L is not at 1, it must be at 3).\n\nAlso, we get feedback on P and S.\n\nSo it\'s informative.\n\nSimilarly, we could test L at position 3 with a word like ""VALUE"", but V and U are less common.\n\nTherefore, I think ""LAPSE"" is a better choice.\n\nBut note: in ""LAPSE"", we have S at position 4. We don\'t know about S.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""LAPSE"".\n\nBut wait, we must ensure that we are not using any absent letters. Absent letters: C, R, N, T, B. ""LAPSE"" has L, A, P, S, E. None of the absent letters. Good.\n\nSo next guess: LAPSE\n\nBut let me confirm the positions:\n- L at 1\n- A at 2 (we know it\'s correct, so it should be ✓)\n- P at 3\n- S at 4\n- E at 5 (correct)\n\nWe expect A and E to be correct, so we are mainly testing L, P, S.\n\nIf L is at 1, it will be ✓. If not, it will be - (since L is in the word but not at 1) or x? But if L is not at 1 and not at 4, then it must be at 3, so if we put L at 1 and it\'s actually at 3, then we would get a \'-\' for L? No: if L is in the word but not at position 1, then we get \'-\'. But if L is at position 3, then when we put L at 1, it should be marked as \'-\' (present but wrong position). Similarly, if L is not in the word at all, it would be x, but we know from guess2 that L is in the word (because in ""table"", L was marked as present but wrong position). So L is definitely in the word, so if not at 1, it will be \'-\'.\n\nTherefore, after this guess, we will know if L is at position 1 or not.\n\nSo it\'s a good test.\n\nThus, I choose ""LAPSE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is confirmed at position 5, A is present but not at position 3, and C, R, N are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (table)**: A is confirmed at position 2, E is confirmed at position 5, L is present but not at position 4, and T, B are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The word pattern is `_ A _ _ E`.\n- Confirmed letters: A (position 2), E (position 5), and L (present but not at position 4).\n- Absent letters: C, R, N, T, B.\n- L must be at position 1 or 3 (since it cannot be at position 4 and positions 2 and 5 are fixed).\n- The unknown positions are 1, 3, and 4. Position 4 is open, and L must occupy position 1 or 3.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Test L at position 1 to determine its location (if L is not at position 1, it must be at position 3).\n- Introduce new common letters (e.g., P, S) for positions 3 and 4 to maximize information.\n- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, T, B).\n\nThe word ""lapse"" fits perfectly:\n- L at position 1 (tests if L is at position 1).\n- A at position 2 (confirmed, so expected ✓).\n- P at position 3 (new letter test).\n- S at position 4 (new letter test).\n- E at position 5 (confirmed, so expected ✓).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities:\n- If L is at position 1, we get ✓ for L and can focus on positions 3 and 4.\n- If L is not at position 1 (resulting in ""-"" for L), it must be at position 3, and we get feedback on P and S.\n\n<guess>lapse</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: table -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓)\nGuess 3: lapse -> FEEDBACK: L(-) A(✓) P(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: crane
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (in word, correct position 5)

- T: x (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct position 2)
- B: x (not in word)
- L: - (in word, wrong position; not position 4)
- E: ✓ (correct position 5)

Guess 3: lapse
- L: - (in word, wrong position; not position 1? Actually, in ""lapse"", L is at position 1, and it's marked as '-', meaning L is in the word but not at position 1)
- A: ✓ (correct position 2)
- P: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct position 5)

Summary of known information:

1. Correct positions:
   - Position 2: A
   - Position 5: E
   So the word pattern is: _ A _ _ E

2. Known present letters (but not yet positioned):
   - L: from guess2 and guess3, we know L is in the word. From guess2, it's not at position 4. From guess3, it's not at position 1. Therefore, L must be at position 3 (since positions 2 and 5 are taken, and the only remaining position is 3).

   Why position 3? Because in a 5-letter word, positions are 1,2,3,4,5. 
   - Position 2 is A, fixed.
   - Position 5 is E, fixed.
   - L cannot be at position 1 (from guess3: L at pos1 marked '-', so not position 1)
   - L cannot be at position 4 (from guess2: L at pos4 marked '-', so not position 4)
   Therefore, L must be at position 3.

   So we now know: the word is _ A L _ E

3. Absent letters (not in the word at all): C, R, N, T, B, P, S.
   (from guess1: C, R, N; guess2: T, B; guess3: P, S)

4. We have one position left: position 1.

5. We also have one letter that must be placed: L is at position 3? Actually, we inferred that L must be at position 3. So the word is ? A L ? E.

6. But we need to confirm: the only unplaced known letter is L, and it must go at position 3. Therefore, the word is: ? A L ? E, with ? being two letters: one at position 1 and one at position 4.

7. Since we don't have any other known letters, we need to guess a word that fits this pattern and is consistent.

8. We must avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, T, B, P, S.

9. What letters have we used so far? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, B, L, P, S. So we might use other vowels or consonants.

10. The word must have exactly 5 letters: first letter (unknown), then A, then L, then fourth letter (unknown), then E.

11. Common letters we haven't tried: D, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

12. We must find a 5-letter word of the form: ? A L ? E.

13. Possibilities for position 4: since the word ends with E, and we have A at 2 and L at 3, common words include:
    - ""b"" for position 1? But B is absent.
    - ""d"" -> ""DALLE""? Not common. 
    - ""g"" -> ""GALE"" is 4 letters? Wait, 5-letter: ""GAYLE"" is a name, but let's stick to common words.
    - Actually, ""value"" is a word but we have V at position 1 and U at position 4: V A L U E -> but U at position 4? Then the word is VALUE: V(1), A(2), L(3), U(4), E(5). This is valid.

    But we haven't used V and U.

14. Another word: ""HALVE"": H(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). Also valid.

15. Or ""SALVE"": but S is absent.

16. Another: ""MAPLE"": but M(1), A(2), P(3), L(4), E(5) -> but here L is at position 4, which we know is incorrect? Also, P is absent.

17. How about ""MALE""? Only 4 letters.

18. We need 5 letters: so words like ""VALUE"", ""HALVE"", ""VALVE"", ""GAMME"" (not a word).

19. Also, ""OILED""? But that doesn't fit the pattern.

20. More: ""WALTZ"" ends with Z, not E.

21. Candidates:
    - VALUE: V, A, L, U, E -> fits pattern, and V and U are untested.
    - HALVE: H, A, L, V, E -> fits.
    - VALVE: V, A, L, V, E -> has two V's. Also fits the pattern.

22. But note: in the pattern, position 4 must be a letter. We know from absent letters that we must avoid C,R,N,T,B,P,S.

    For VALUE: V and U are new and not in the absent list.
    For HALVE: H and V are new.
    For VALVE: V is used twice, but we don't know if V is in the word.

23. However, we have limited guesses. We need one more letter for position 1 and one for position 4.

24. Since we don't have any constraint on position 4 except that it's not an absent letter, and L is fixed at 3, we can choose any word that fits ?AL?E.

25. Let me think of common words: 
    - ""scale"" -> but S is absent and C absent.
    - ""balmy"" -> doesn't end with E and B absent.
    - ""dally"" -> not ending with E.

26. Another: ""ALIKE"" -> A at 1, but we need position 1 to be ?, position 2 is A, so ""ALIKE"" has A at 1, which is different.

    We must have A at position 2, so words starting with A don't work.

27. So back to ""VALUE"", ""HALVE"", etc.

28. Also, ""GABLE"": G,A,B,L,E -> but B is absent? From guess2, B is absent. So no.

29. ""MAPLE"": M,A,P,L,E -> P absent.

30. ""TABLE"" we already tried, T and B absent.

31. Therefore, options are limited.

32. Let's list possible words:
    - VALUE (valid word, uses V,U)
    - HALVE (valid word, uses H,V)
    - VALVE (valid word, uses V twice)
    - DALLE? Not a common word.
    - MALLE? Not common.

33. Also: ""OLEIC""? Not matching.

34. Another possibility: ""PULSE"" but P and S are absent.

35. Or ""MILDE"" not a word.

36. Perhaps ""HAVOC"" doesn't end with E.

37. So potential guesses: VALUE, HALVE, VALVE.

38. Since we have only 3 guesses left (since 3 used, we have 3 more), we can choose one.

39. How to decide? We want to choose a word that tests a common letter for position 1.

40. Also, note that in all these, position 4 is either U, V, or E? Not E.

41. But E is already at 5.

42. We must choose one. We can test VALUE.

43. Alternatively, we might consider that we haven't used D, M, O, etc.

44. Is there a word like ""DALE"" but 5 letters? ""DALLE"" is not standard.

45. ""AMBLE"": A at position 1, not 2? And M,B -> B absent.

46. ""ALONE"": A at 1, but we need A at 2? No, ""ALONE"" wouldn't fit.

47. We must have the pattern: position1=?, position2=A, position3=L, position4=?, position5=E.

48. Words: 
    - With position1=V, position4=U: VALUE
    - With position1=H, position4=V: HALVE
    - With position1=V, position4=V: VALVE

    Note: HALVE and VALVE both have V at position4, but VALUE has U at position4.

49. Since we don't have information about V or U, any guess might reveal.

50. But we also want to avoid repeating letters unnecessarily? Because we don't know if V is duplicated.

51. Considering Wordle strategies, testing a word with more new letters is better.

52. VALUE has two new letters: V and U.
    HALVE also has two: H and V.
    VALVE has one new letter: V (since V appears twice).

53. So VALUE and HALVE are better than VALVE.

54. Between VALUE and HALVE, which is more common? VALUE is a very common word.

55. Alternatively, is there another word? Let me think of ""CANOE"" but C absent and pattern not fit.

56. How about ""GAVEL"": G,A,V,E,L -> but pattern: G(1),A(2),V(3),E(4),L(5) -> but we need position5=E, and in ""GAVEL"", position5 is L, and position4 is E? So it would be G A V E L, which doesn't have L at position3? 

    We need the letter at position3 to be L. In ""GAVEL"", position3 is V, not L.

57. So not.

58. Therefore, I'll go with ""VALUE"" as it's a common word and uses new letters.

59. Moreover, if we guess VALUE, and the word is actually HALVE, we'll get feedback that V is present but maybe not position1? But we'd know.

60. Using the pattern: the current pattern is ?AL?E. So if the secret word is HALVE, then it would be H A L V E.

61. Similarly, VALUE is V A L U E.

62. Both are valid.

63. Given that, I choose ""VALUE"" because it's more frequently used.

64. So next guess: VALUE

65. But note: we have established that L must be at position3. Therefore, in the guess, L at position3 is expected to be correct? But we haven't confirmed that L is at position3; we inferred it. So if we guess VALUE, we are testing that inference.

    However, based on the feedback, L cannot be at position1 or position4, and positions2 and5 are fixed, so it must be at position3. Therefore, we are confident.

66. So ""VALUE"" has L at position3, which should be ✓.

67. So feedback expectation: 
  - V at position1: could be ✓, -, or x
  - A at position2: ✓
  - L at position3: ✓ (since we inferred it must be here)
  - U at position4: ? 
  - E at position5: ✓

68. This will tell us if V and U are in the word.

69. Similarly, if the word is HALVE, then V would be at position4.

70. But we are guessing VALUE. So let's go with that.

Therefore, the next guess is ""value"".

### Summary of Known Information:
1. **Confirmed Positions**:
   - Position 2: A (✓ from guess 2)
   - Position 5: E (✓ from guesses 1 and 2)
2. **Confirmed Present Letter**:
   - L (marked ""-"" in guess 2 and 3, so it must be in the word but not at positions 1, 3 (from ""crane""), or 4 (from ""table"" and ""lapse""). The only remaining position is 3. Thus, L must be at position 3.
3. **Word Pattern**: With A at position 2, L at position 3, and E at position 5, the word must be `_ A L _ E`.
4. **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, T, B, P, S (all marked ""x"" in prior guesses).
5. **Unknown Positions**: Only position 1 and 4 are unknown.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test position 1 and 4**: Use a valid English word fitting `_ A L _ E`, introducing new letters to gather feedback.
- **Avoid absent letters**: Focus on untested common consonants/vowels (e.g., D, G, M, V).
- **Select a word** that maximizes information: ""value"" fits perfectly, testing V (position 1) and U (position 4) while confirming the inferred positions for A, L, and E.

   - L cannot be at position 1 (from guess3: L at pos1 marked '-', so not position 1)

52. VALUE has two new letters: V and U.
    HALVE also has two: H and V.
    VALVE has one new letter: V (since V appears twice).

53. So VALUE and HALVE are better than VALVE.

54. Between VALUE and HALVE, which is more common? VALUE is a very common word.

55. Alternatively, is there another word? Let me think of ""CANOE"" but C absent and pattern not fit.

56. How about ""GAVEL"": G,A,V,E,L -> but pattern: G(1),A(2),V(3),E(4),L(5) -> but we need position5=E, and in ""GAVEL"", position5 is L, and position4 is E? So it would be G A V E L, which doesn't have L at position3? 

    We need the letter at position3 to be L. In ""GAVEL"", position3 is V, not L.

57. So not.

58. Therefore, I'll go with ""VALUE"" as it's a common word and uses new letters.

59. Moreover, if we guess VALUE, and the word is actually HALVE, we'll get feedback that V is present but maybe not position1? But we'd know.

60. Using the pattern: the current pattern is ?AL?E. So if the secret word is HALVE, then it would be H A L V E.

61. Similarly, VALUE is V A L U E.

62. Both are valid.

63. Given that, I choose ""VALUE"" because it's more frequently used.

64. So next guess: VALUE

65. But note: we have established that L must be at position3. Therefore, in the guess, L at position3 is expected to be correct? But we haven't confirmed that L is at position3; we inferred it. So if we guess VALUE, we are testing that inference.

    However, based on the feedback, L cannot be at position1 or position4, and positions2 and5 are fixed, so it must be at position3. Therefore, we are confident.

66. So ""VALUE"" has L at position3, which should be ✓.

67. So feedback expectation: 
  - V at position1: could be ✓, -, or x
  - A at position2: ✓
  - L at position3: ✓ (since we inferred it must be here)
  - U at position4: ? 
  - E at position5: ✓

68. This will tell us if V and U are in the word.

69. Similarly, if the word is HALVE, then V would be at position4.

70. But we are guessing VALUE. So let's go with that.

Therefore, the next guess is ""value"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

### Summary of Known Information:
1. **Confirmed Positions**:
   - Position 2: A (✓ from guess 2)
   - Position 5: E (✓ from guesses 1 and 2)
2. **Confirmed Present Letter**:
   - L (marked ""-"" in guess 2 and 3, so it must be in the word but not at positions 1, 3 (from ""crane""), or 4 (from ""table"" and ""lapse""). The only remaining position is 3. Thus, L must be at position 3.
3. **Word Pattern**: With A at position 2, L at position 3, and E at position 5, the word must be `_ A L _ E`.
4. **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, T, B, P, S (all marked ""x"" in prior guesses).
5. **Unknown Positions**: Only position 1 and 4 are unknown.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test position 1 and 4**: Use a valid English word fitting `_ A L _ E`, introducing new letters to gather feedback.
- **Avoid absent letters**: Focus on untested common consonants/vowels (e.g., D, G, M, V).
- **Select a word** that maximizes information: ""value"" fits perfectly, testing V (position 1) and U (position 4) while confirming the inferred positions for A, L, and E.",Guess 4: value -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) A(✓) L(✓) U(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
