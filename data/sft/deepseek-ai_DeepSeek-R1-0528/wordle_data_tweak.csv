First, I need to make my first guess for the Wordle game. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior information, so I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get.

I recall that in Wordle, it's often recommended to start with a word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants. This helps in eliminating or confirming multiple letters at once.

Common English vowels are A, E, I, O, U. Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are also frequent.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it includes common letters: C, R, A, N, E. That covers three vowels (A and E) and common consonants.

Another good one is ""SLATE"" with S, L, A, T, E—again, multiple vowels and common consonants.

I should avoid words with repeated letters since that reduces the information from a single guess.

Checking E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C—these are among the most common letters in English words.

""SOARE"" is sometimes used, but ""SOARE"" isn't very common; it might not be in the word list.

I need to stick to valid 5-letter English words.

For practicality, I'll go with ""CRANE"". Let me confirm: C-R-A-N-E.

- C: some common words

- R: very common

- A: most common vowel

- N: common consonant

- E: most common vowel

""CRANE"" has no repeated letters, so each position gives unique information.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is good with R, A, I, S, E—three vowels and two consonants.

But ""CRANE"" feels fine.

I could consider word frequency. For example, ""SALET"" is another one, but less common.

I'll stick with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

After this guess, I'll get feedback like ✓, -, or x for each letter, which I can use for subsequent guesses.

But for now, since it's the first guess, I just need to output my guess.

So, I should think step by step, then provide the guess.

Thought process: I choose ""CRANE"" because it's a strong starter in Wordle, covering multiple common letters without repeats to maximize information gain.

Finally, format as specified: with <guess>guessed-word</guess> tags.

For the first guess, I need to select a valid 5-letter English word that maximizes informational value. Common Wordle strategies suggest starting with words that include frequent letters (like vowels and common consonants) to cover more possibilities and reduce uncertainty quickly. Ideally, the word should have no repeated letters to gain the most feedback per guess.

After considering options:
- **CRANE** is a strong choice because it contains three vowels (A and E, with E being the most common English vowel) and common consonants (C, R, N). It's a high-information word used by many players to test key letters early.
- Alternatives like ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"" are also good, but ""CRANE"" provides a balanced mix and is widely accepted as an effective starter.

This guess will give feedback on five distinct letters, helping to narrow down the secret word significantly for subsequent guesses.

We are making the first guess, but the previous feedback says that the guessed-word was not five letters. That means there was an error in the previous response format.

Let me check the previous response:
I returned: <guess>guessed-word</> but the guessed word should be an actual word, like 'crane'. In the previous thought, I intended to guess 'crane', but in the tags I wrote ""guessed-word"" as a placeholder? That was a mistake.

In the response format, it says: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.""

I think ""guessed-word"" was meant to be replaced by the actual word, e.g., <guess>crane</guess>.

However, in my first response, I wrote: ""<guess>guessed-word</guess>"" literally, and the feedback says ""Model answer is not five letters"" because ""guessed-word"" is more than five letters and not a valid word? Actually, ""guessed-word"" isn't a five-letter word; it's 12 letters including the hyphen? But clearly, that was a placeholder. So I must have messed up the response.

Now, the system is asking me to make a new guess after that feedback. But since the first guess was invalid, I need to start over with a valid first guess.

So now, I must make a valid first guess with an actual 5-letter word.

Let me redo:

Step-by-step thought:
- For the first guess, I choose a word that maximizes information.
- ""CRANE"" is a good choice: 5 letters, all distinct, with common vowels and consonants.
- Other options: ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", ""RAISE"", etc., but ""CRANE"" is standard.

Therefore, I will guess ""CRANE"".

Then, output in the correct format: <guess>crane</guess>

It seems there was a mistake in the previous guess format—""guessed-word"" was a placeholder, not an actual word. I'll make a valid first guess now. For maximum informational value, I choose ""CRANE"" because:

We are in a Wordle game. The previous two attempts to guess were invalid because I used ""guessed-word"" as a placeholder instead of an actual word. Now, I must make a valid first guess with a real 5-letter word.

I need to choose a word that is exactly 5 letters long and is a valid English word. I should pick a word that has common letters to maximize the information from the feedback.

Common starting words in Wordle include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- RAISE

- SALET

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it is a standard choice. It has the letters C, R, A, N, E — which are all common and include two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

I recall that in Wordle, it's often recommended to start with a word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants. This helps in eliminating or confirming multiple letters at once.

Common English vowels are A, E, I, O, U. Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are also frequent.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it includes common letters: C, R, A, N, E. That covers three vowels (A and E) and common consonants.

Another good one is ""SLATE"" with S, L, A, T, E—again, multiple vowels and common consonants.

I should avoid words with repeated letters since that reduces the information from a single guess.

Checking E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C—these are among the most common letters in English words.

""SOARE"" is sometimes used, but ""SOARE"" isn't very common; it might not be in the word list.

I need to stick to valid 5-letter English words.

For practicality, I'll go with ""CRANE"". Let me confirm: C-R-A-N-E.

- C: some common words

- R: very common

- A: most common vowel

- N: common consonant

- E: most common vowel

""CRANE"" has no repeated letters, so each position gives unique information.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is good with R, A, I, S, E—three vowels and two consonants.

But ""CRANE"" feels fine.

I could consider word frequency. For example, ""SALET"" is another one, but less common.

I'll stick with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

After this guess, I'll get feedback like ✓, -, or x for each letter, which I can use for subsequent guesses.

But for now, since it's the first guess, I just need to output my guess.

So, I should think step by step, then provide the guess.

Thought process: I choose ""CRANE"" because it's a strong starter in Wordle, covering multiple common letters without repeats to maximize information gain.

We are playing Wordle. After three guesses, we have feedback from the third guess ""crane"":
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So, from guess 3:
- A and E are present in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 3 and 5 respectively).
- C, R, N are not in the word at all.

Now, we need to make a new guess (which will be the fourth guess overall, but effectively the first with feedback).

Constraints from previous feedback:
- The secret word contains A and E, but not in positions 3 or 5 (since in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and E at position 5, and they are marked as wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain C, R, or N.

We also know that the word is 5 letters.

We need to choose a word that:
- Includes A and E (since they are present)
- Does not include C, R, N (since they are absent)
- Places A and E in positions different from 3 and 5.

Additionally, we should try to cover new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

We have two known letters: A and E must be in the word, but not at pos 3 or 5.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4 (since not 3, and positions are 1-based? In ""crane"", A was at index 3, which is the third position. Let's clarify indexing: usually, positions are 1 to 5 from left to right.

In ""crane"":
Position 1: C
Position 2: R
Position 3: A
Position 4: N
Position 5: E

So, A cannot be at position 3, and E cannot be at position 5.

Therefore, A can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.
E can be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

We also need to avoid C, R, N.

Now, for the new guess, we should try to place A and E in new positions and include other common letters.

Let's think of words that have A and E, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

A good word might be ""SLATE"", but let's check:
- S, L, A, T, E
But we have A and E, and we can test S, L, T.

However, in ""SLATE"", A is at position 3 and E at position 5. But from feedback, A cannot be at position 3? No, the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3, so in the secret word, A is not at 3. Similarly, E is not at 5.

But in ""SLATE"", if we put A at 3 and E at 5, that might be okay for the guess because we are testing, but actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at 3 and E is not at 5, so if we guess ""SLATE"", we are putting A in a position we know is wrong, which might not be efficient. But it could still be useful to test other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that places A and E in positions that are still possible.

For example, put A at position 1 or 2 or 4, and E at 1,2,3,4.

Let's list possible words.

We can also consider that we have two letters to place: A and E.

To maximize information, we should include three new letters.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, D, U, M, P, etc.

A word with A and E and three new consonants.

For example:
- If we put A at position 1: words like A _ _ _ E, but E cannot be at 5? E can be at 5? No, E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word? Let's clarify.

The feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. So in the secret word, E is present, but not at position 5. So E can be at 1,2,3, or 4.

Similarly, A can be at 1,2,4 (not 3).

So for the secret word, position 3 cannot be A, and position 5 cannot be E.

Now, for our guess, we can put A and E anywhere to test, but it's better to put them in positions that are still possible to get direct hits.

For example, if we put A at position 1, and it's correct, we get a green. Similarly for E.

But we don't know, so we should spread them.

Let's think of a word that has A and E, avoids C,R,N, and has common other letters.

Possible words:
- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. But E at 5: we know E is not at 5 in the secret word, so if we put E at 5 in the guess, it will likely be marked as wrong position (if E is present) or we might get feedback that it's not there, but we know E is present, so it will be marked as wrong position. But that doesn't give new information because we already know E is not at 5. So it's a bit wasteful.

Better to put E in a position that could be correct, like 1,2,3,4.

Similarly for A.

So, let's avoid putting A at 3 or E at 5 in our guess, to potentially get a green.

For example, put A at position 1 or 2 or 4, and E at 1,2,3,4.

A word like ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at 3, E at 5. But A at 3: we know A is not at 3 in secret, so if we put A at 3, it will be marked as wrong position (yellow) which we already know, so no new info. Similarly, E at 5 will be yellow, which we know. So we only get info on P, L, T.

But we can do better.

How about ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T -> E at 2, A at 3. But A at 3 is invalid for secret, so A will be yellow, and E at 2 might be good.

In ""LEAST"":
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: T

But we know A cannot be at 3, so if we guess this, position 3 will be yellow for A, which we know, so it doesn't help. E at 2 might be correct or not.

Similarly, ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> A at 3, E at 5, both in positions we know are wrong, so we only test S, T, L.

Not efficient.

Better to choose a word where A and E are in positions that could be correct.

For example, put A at position 1: words like ""ADIEU"", but ""ADIEU"" has D, I, E, U. E is at position 4? ""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U -> A at 1, E at 4.

Also, it has I and U, which are vowels, and D.

But we need to avoid R and N, which we are, and C is already out.

""ADIEU"" is a common Wordle word.

But let's see: A at position 1, which is possible. E at position 4, which is also possible (since E can be at 4).

And we test D, I, U.

But we have two vowels already, and adding I and U might not be the best for consonant coverage.

Another word: ""SLATE"" but with E not at 5. We need to move E.

How about ""STEAL"": S, T, E, A, L -> E at 3, A at 5? ""STEAL"": S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), L(5)? No: S-T-E-A-L, so positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:A, 5:L.

So A is at 4, E at 3.

Now, A at 4 is possible (since not 3), E at 3 is possible (since E can be at 3).

And we test S, T, L.

This seems good.

""STEAL"" has S, T, E, A, L.

Letters: S, T, E, A, L — all common, and we avoid C, R, N.

Also, E is at 3, which is a new position, and A at 4.

We know A is not at 3, but 4 is fine. E can be at 3.

So this could work.

Another option: ""LATTE"" but has double T, which reduces information, so better to avoid repeats.

""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. But E at 5 is invalid, so E will be yellow, which we know, so not ideal.

""PALET"" or ""PLATE"" with E at 5.

Better to avoid E at 5.

""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E at 2, but no A? We must include A because we know A is in the word. We have to include both A and E in the guess to confirm or get positions.

In the guess, we don't have to include them, but it's better to, because we know they are in the word, so we can try to find their positions.

If we don't include A or E, we might miss the chance to get them correct.

So, I think we should include both A and E in the guess.

Therefore, ""STEAL"" seems good: S, T, E, A, L.

Positions: E at 3, A at 4.

We can also consider ""SALET"", but ""SALET"" is S, A, L, E, T -> A at 2, E at 4? S-A-L-E-T, so 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. So A at 2, E at 4. Both positions are possible for A and E.

And we test S, L, T.

""SALET"" is a valid word, often used in Wordle.

But in ""SALET"", A is at 2, E at 4.

Similarly, ""STEAL"" has E at 3, A at 4.

Both are fine.

I think I'll go with ""STEAL"" to test E at position 3 and A at position 4.

So, guess: STEAL

But let's confirm the letters: S, T, E, A, L — none of C, R, N, so good.

We also get to test S, T, L.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another common word: ""ALERT"", but R is not allowed, since R is absent.

""R"" is out, so no.

""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 is bad.

""ABLED"": A, B, L, E, D -> A at 1, E at 4. Good, but B and D are less common.

""STEAL"" seems better.

I think ""STEAL"" is a solid choice.

So, I'll guess ""steal"".

But in the output, it should be lowercase? Probably case doesn't matter, but I'll use lowercase for consistency.

In previous, I used ""crane"", so lowercase.

So, <guess>steal</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from Guess 3 (""crane""):
- C, R, N are **absent** from the secret word.
- A and E are **present** but in the wrong positions (A not at position 3, E not at position 5).

For the new guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word).
- Must avoid C, R, N (since they are absent).
- A cannot be placed at position 3, and E cannot be placed at position 5 (to avoid redundant feedback).
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L) to maximize information gain.

The word ""steal"" is chosen because:
- It includes A and E (A at position 4, E at position 3—both valid positions based on feedback).
- It avoids C, R, N.
- It introduces three new common letters: S, T, L.
- All letters are distinct, ensuring efficient feedback.

This guess will help identify the positions of A and E while testing S, T, and L for presence/absence.

<guess>steal</guess>",steal,"We are playing Wordle. After three guesses, we have feedback from the third guess ""crane"":
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So, from guess 3:
- A and E are present in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 3 and 5 respectively).
- C, R, N are not in the word at all.

Now, we need to make a new guess (which will be the fourth guess overall, but effectively the first with feedback).

Constraints from previous feedback:
- The secret word contains A and E, but not in positions 3 or 5 (since in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and E at position 5, and they are marked as wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain C, R, or N.

We also know that the word is 5 letters.

We need to choose a word that:
- Includes A and E (since they are present)
- Does not include C, R, N (since they are absent)
- Places A and E in positions different from 3 and 5.

Additionally, we should try to cover new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

We have two known letters: A and E must be in the word, but not at pos 3 or 5.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4 (since not 3, and positions are 1-based? In ""crane"", A was at index 3, which is the third position. Let's clarify indexing: usually, positions are 1 to 5 from left to right.

In ""crane"":
Position 1: C
Position 2: R
Position 3: A
Position 4: N
Position 5: E

So, A cannot be at position 3, and E cannot be at position 5.

Therefore, A can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.
E can be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

We also need to avoid C, R, N.

Now, for the new guess, we should try to place A and E in new positions and include other common letters.

Let's think of words that have A and E, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

A good word might be ""SLATE"", but let's check:
- S, L, A, T, E
But we have A and E, and we can test S, L, T.

However, in ""SLATE"", A is at position 3 and E at position 5. But from feedback, A cannot be at position 3? No, the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3, so in the secret word, A is not at 3. Similarly, E is not at 5.

But in ""SLATE"", if we put A at 3 and E at 5, that might be okay for the guess because we are testing, but actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at 3 and E is not at 5, so if we guess ""SLATE"", we are putting A in a position we know is wrong, which might not be efficient. But it could still be useful to test other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that places A and E in positions that are still possible.

For example, put A at position 1 or 2 or 4, and E at 1,2,3,4.

Let's list possible words.

We can also consider that we have two letters to place: A and E.

To maximize information, we should include three new letters.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, D, U, M, P, etc.

A word with A and E and three new consonants.

For example:
- If we put A at position 1: words like A _ _ _ E, but E cannot be at 5? E can be at 5? No, E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word? Let's clarify.

The feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. So in the secret word, E is present, but not at position 5. So E can be at 1,2,3, or 4.

Similarly, A can be at 1,2,4 (not 3).

So for the secret word, position 3 cannot be A, and position 5 cannot be E.

Now, for our guess, we can put A and E anywhere to test, but it's better to put them in positions that are still possible to get direct hits.

For example, if we put A at position 1, and it's correct, we get a green. Similarly for E.

But we don't know, so we should spread them.

Let's think of a word that has A and E, avoids C,R,N, and has common other letters.

Possible words:
- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. But E at 5: we know E is not at 5 in the secret word, so if we put E at 5 in the guess, it will likely be marked as wrong position (if E is present) or we might get feedback that it's not there, but we know E is present, so it will be marked as wrong position. But that doesn't give new information because we already know E is not at 5. So it's a bit wasteful.

Better to put E in a position that could be correct, like 1,2,3,4.

Similarly for A.

So, let's avoid putting A at 3 or E at 5 in our guess, to potentially get a green.

For example, put A at position 1 or 2 or 4, and E at 1,2,3,4.

A word like ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at 3, E at 5. But A at 3: we know A is not at 3 in secret, so if we put A at 3, it will be marked as wrong position (yellow) which we already know, so no new info. Similarly, E at 5 will be yellow, which we know. So we only get info on P, L, T.

But we can do better.

How about ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T -> E at 2, A at 3. But A at 3 is invalid for secret, so A will be yellow, and E at 2 might be good.

In ""LEAST"":
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: T

But we know A cannot be at 3, so if we guess this, position 3 will be yellow for A, which we know, so it doesn't help. E at 2 might be correct or not.

Similarly, ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> A at 3, E at 5, both in positions we know are wrong, so we only test S, T, L.

Not efficient.

Better to choose a word where A and E are in positions that could be correct.

For example, put A at position 1: words like ""ADIEU"", but ""ADIEU"" has D, I, E, U. E is at position 4? ""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U -> A at 1, E at 4.

Also, it has I and U, which are vowels, and D.

But we need to avoid R and N, which we are, and C is already out.

""ADIEU"" is a common Wordle word.

But let's see: A at position 1, which is possible. E at position 4, which is also possible (since E can be at 4).

And we test D, I, U.

But we have two vowels already, and adding I and U might not be the best for consonant coverage.

Another word: ""SLATE"" but with E not at 5. We need to move E.

How about ""STEAL"": S, T, E, A, L -> E at 3, A at 5? ""STEAL"": S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), L(5)? No: S-T-E-A-L, so positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:A, 5:L.

So A is at 4, E at 3.

Now, A at 4 is possible (since not 3), E at 3 is possible (since E can be at 3).

And we test S, T, L.

This seems good.

""STEAL"" has S, T, E, A, L.

Letters: S, T, E, A, L — all common, and we avoid C, R, N.

Also, E is at 3, which is a new position, and A at 4.

We know A is not at 3, but 4 is fine. E can be at 3.

So this could work.

Another option: ""LATTE"" but has double T, which reduces information, so better to avoid repeats.

""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. But E at 5 is invalid, so E will be yellow, which we know, so not ideal.

""PALET"" or ""PLATE"" with E at 5.

Better to avoid E at 5.

""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E at 2, but no A? We must include A because we know A is in the word. We have to include both A and E in the guess to confirm or get positions.

In the guess, we don't have to include them, but it's better to, because we know they are in the word, so we can try to find their positions.

So, I think we should include both A and E in the guess.

Therefore, ""STEAL"" seems good: S, T, E, A, L.

Positions: E at 3, A at 4.

We can also consider ""SALET"", but ""SALET"" is S, A, L, E, T -> A at 2, E at 4? S-A-L-E-T, so 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. So A at 2, E at 4. Both positions are possible for A and E.

And we test S, L, T.

""SALET"" is a valid word, often used in Wordle.

But in ""SALET"", A is at 2, E at 4.

Similarly, ""STEAL"" has E at 3, A at 4.

Both are fine.

I think I'll go with ""STEAL"" to test E at position 3 and A at position 4.

So, guess: STEAL

But let's confirm the letters: S, T, E, A, L — none of C, R, N, so good.

We also get to test S, T, L.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another common word: ""ALERT"", but R is not allowed, since R is absent.

""R"" is out, so no.

""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 is bad.

""ABLED"": A, B, L, E, D -> A at 1, E at 4. Good, but B and D are less common.

""STEAL"" seems better.

I think ""STEAL"" is a solid choice.

So, I'll guess ""steal"".

But in the output, it should be lowercase? Probably case doesn't matter, but I'll use lowercase for consistency.

In previous, I used ""crane"", so lowercase.

So, <guess>steal</guess>Based on the feedback from Guess 3 (""crane""):
- C, R, N are **absent** from the secret word.
- A and E are **present** but in the wrong positions (A not at position 3, E not at position 5).

For the new guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word).
- Must avoid C, R, N (since they are absent).
- A cannot be placed at position 3, and E cannot be placed at position 5 (to avoid redundant feedback).
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L) to maximize information gain.

The word ""steal"" is chosen because:

- It avoids C, R, N.
- It introduces three new common letters: S, T, L.
- All letters are distinct, ensuring efficient feedback.

This guess will help identify the positions of A and E while testing S, T, and L for presence/absence.",Guess 4: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) E(✓) A(✓) L(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,tweak,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make my first guess for the Wordle game. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior information, so I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get.

I recall that in Wordle, it's often recommended to start with a word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants. This helps in eliminating or confirming multiple letters at once.

Common English vowels are A, E, I, O, U. Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are also frequent.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it includes common letters: C, R, A, N, E. That covers three vowels (A and E) and common consonants.

Another good one is ""SLATE"" with S, L, A, T, E—again, multiple vowels and common consonants.

I should avoid words with repeated letters since that reduces the information from a single guess.

Checking E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C—these are among the most common letters in English words.

""SOARE"" is sometimes used, but ""SOARE"" isn't very common; it might not be in the word list.

I need to stick to valid 5-letter English words.

For practicality, I'll go with ""CRANE"". Let me confirm: C-R-A-N-E.

- C: some common words

- R: very common

- A: most common vowel

- N: common consonant

- E: most common vowel

""CRANE"" has no repeated letters, so each position gives unique information.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is good with R, A, I, S, E—three vowels and two consonants.

But ""CRANE"" feels fine.

I could consider word frequency. For example, ""SALET"" is another one, but less common.

I'll stick with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

After this guess, I'll get feedback like ✓, -, or x for each letter, which I can use for subsequent guesses.

But for now, since it's the first guess, I just need to output my guess.

So, I should think step by step, then provide the guess.

Thought process: I choose ""CRANE"" because it's a strong starter in Wordle, covering multiple common letters without repeats to maximize information gain.

Finally, format as specified: with <guess>guessed-word</guess> tags.For the first guess, I need to select a valid 5-letter English word that maximizes informational value. Common Wordle strategies suggest starting with words that include frequent letters (like vowels and common consonants) to cover more possibilities and reduce uncertainty quickly. Ideally, the word should have no repeated letters to gain the most feedback per guess.

After considering options:
- **CRANE** is a strong choice because it contains three vowels (A and E, with E being the most common English vowel) and common consonants (C, R, N). It's a high-information word used by many players to test key letters early.
- Alternatives like ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"" are also good, but ""CRANE"" provides a balanced mix and is widely accepted as an effective starter.

This guess will give feedback on five distinct letters, helping to narrow down the secret word significantly for subsequent guesses.

<guess>guessed-word</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess, but the previous feedback says that the guessed-word was not five letters. That means there was an error in the previous response format.

Let me check the previous response:
I returned: <guess>guessed-word</> but the guessed word should be an actual word, like 'crane'. In the previous thought, I intended to guess 'crane', but in the tags I wrote ""guessed-word"" as a placeholder? That was a mistake.

In the response format, it says: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.""

I think ""guessed-word"" was meant to be replaced by the actual word, e.g., <guess>crane</guess>.

However, in my first response, I wrote: ""<guess>guessed-word</guess>"" literally, and the feedback says ""Model answer is not five letters"" because ""guessed-word"" is more than five letters and not a valid word? Actually, ""guessed-word"" isn't a five-letter word; it's 12 letters including the hyphen? But clearly, that was a placeholder. So I must have messed up the response.

Now, the system is asking me to make a new guess after that feedback. But since the first guess was invalid, I need to start over with a valid first guess.

So now, I must make a valid first guess with an actual 5-letter word.

Let me redo:

Step-by-step thought:
- For the first guess, I choose a word that maximizes information.
- ""CRANE"" is a good choice: 5 letters, all distinct, with common vowels and consonants.
- Other options: ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", ""RAISE"", etc., but ""CRANE"" is standard.

Therefore, I will guess ""CRANE"".

Then, output in the correct format: <guess>crane</guess>It seems there was a mistake in the previous guess format—""guessed-word"" was a placeholder, not an actual word. I'll make a valid first guess now. For maximum informational value, I choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains 5 distinct letters.
- It uses common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N).
- Testing these high-frequency letters early helps narrow possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>guessed-word</> but the guessed word should be an actual word, like 'crane'. In the previous thought, I intended to guess 'crane', but in the tags I wrote ""guessed-word"" as a placeholder? That was a mistake.

<｜Assistant｜>We are in a Wordle game. The previous two attempts to guess were invalid because I used ""guessed-word"" as a placeholder instead of an actual word. Now, I must make a valid first guess with a real 5-letter word.

I need to choose a word that is exactly 5 letters long and is a valid English word. I should pick a word that has common letters to maximize the information from the feedback.

Common starting words in Wordle include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- RAISE
- ROAST
- SALET

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it is a standard choice. It has the letters C, R, A, N, E — which are all common and include two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

This time, I will output the guess in the correct format: <guess>crane</guess>

Let me make sure: ""crane"" is 5 letters, and it's a valid word.

So, my response should be:
<guess>crane</guess>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 3: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are playing Wordle. After three guesses, we have feedback from the third guess ""crane"":
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So, from guess 3:
- A and E are present in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 3 and 5 respectively).
- C, R, N are not in the word at all.

Now, we need to make a new guess (which will be the fourth guess overall, but effectively the first with feedback).

Constraints from previous feedback:
- The secret word contains A and E, but not in positions 3 or 5 (since in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and E at position 5, and they are marked as wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain C, R, or N.

We also know that the word is 5 letters.

We need to choose a word that:
- Includes A and E (since they are present)
- Does not include C, R, N (since they are absent)
- Places A and E in positions different from 3 and 5.

Additionally, we should try to cover new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

We have two known letters: A and E must be in the word, but not at pos 3 or 5.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4 (since not 3, and positions are 1-based? In ""crane"", A was at index 3, which is the third position. Let's clarify indexing: usually, positions are 1 to 5 from left to right.

In ""crane"":
Position 1: C
Position 2: R
Position 3: A
Position 4: N
Position 5: E

So, A cannot be at position 3, and E cannot be at position 5.

Therefore, A can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.
E can be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

We also need to avoid C, R, N.

Now, for the new guess, we should try to place A and E in new positions and include other common letters.

Let's think of words that have A and E, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

A good word might be ""SLATE"", but let's check:
- S, L, A, T, E
But we have A and E, and we can test S, L, T.

However, in ""SLATE"", A is at position 3 and E at position 5. But from feedback, A cannot be at position 3? No, the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3, so in the secret word, A is not at 3. Similarly, E is not at 5.

But in ""SLATE"", if we put A at 3 and E at 5, that might be okay for the guess because we are testing, but actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at 3 and E is not at 5, so if we guess ""SLATE"", we are putting A in a position we know is wrong, which might not be efficient. But it could still be useful to test other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that places A and E in positions that are still possible.

For example, put A at position 1 or 2 or 4, and E at 1,2,3,4.

Let's list possible words.

We can also consider that we have two letters to place: A and E.

To maximize information, we should include three new letters.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, D, U, M, P, etc.

A word with A and E and three new consonants.

For example:
- If we put A at position 1: words like A _ _ _ E, but E cannot be at 5? E can be at 5? No, E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word? Let's clarify.

The feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. So in the secret word, E is present, but not at position 5. So E can be at 1,2,3, or 4.

Similarly, A can be at 1,2,4 (not 3).

So for the secret word, position 3 cannot be A, and position 5 cannot be E.

Now, for our guess, we can put A and E anywhere to test, but it's better to put them in positions that are still possible to get direct hits.

For example, if we put A at position 1, and it's correct, we get a green. Similarly for E.

But we don't know, so we should spread them.

Let's think of a word that has A and E, avoids C,R,N, and has common other letters.

Possible words:
- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. But E at 5: we know E is not at 5 in the secret word, so if we put E at 5 in the guess, it will likely be marked as wrong position (if E is present) or we might get feedback that it's not there, but we know E is present, so it will be marked as wrong position. But that doesn't give new information because we already know E is not at 5. So it's a bit wasteful.

Better to put E in a position that could be correct, like 1,2,3,4.

Similarly for A.

So, let's avoid putting A at 3 or E at 5 in our guess, to potentially get a green.

For example, put A at position 1 or 2 or 4, and E at 1,2,3,4.

A word like ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at 3, E at 5. But A at 3: we know A is not at 3 in secret, so if we put A at 3, it will be marked as wrong position (yellow) which we already know, so no new info. Similarly, E at 5 will be yellow, which we know. So we only get info on P, L, T.

But we can do better.

How about ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T -> E at 2, A at 3. But A at 3 is invalid for secret, so A will be yellow, and E at 2 might be good.

In ""LEAST"":
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: T

But we know A cannot be at 3, so if we guess this, position 3 will be yellow for A, which we know, so it doesn't help. E at 2 might be correct or not.

Similarly, ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> A at 3, E at 5, both in positions we know are wrong, so we only test S, T, L.

Not efficient.

Better to choose a word where A and E are in positions that could be correct.

For example, put A at position 1: words like ""ADIEU"", but ""ADIEU"" has D, I, E, U. E is at position 4? ""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U -> A at 1, E at 4.

Also, it has I and U, which are vowels, and D.

But we need to avoid R and N, which we are, and C is already out.

""ADIEU"" is a common Wordle word.

But let's see: A at position 1, which is possible. E at position 4, which is also possible (since E can be at 4).

And we test D, I, U.

But we have two vowels already, and adding I and U might not be the best for consonant coverage.

Another word: ""SLATE"" but with E not at 5. We need to move E.

How about ""STEAL"": S, T, E, A, L -> E at 3, A at 5? ""STEAL"": S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), L(5)? No: S-T-E-A-L, so positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:A, 5:L.

So A is at 4, E at 3.

Now, A at 4 is possible (since not 3), E at 3 is possible (since E can be at 3).

And we test S, T, L.

This seems good.

""STEAL"" has S, T, E, A, L.

Letters: S, T, E, A, L — all common, and we avoid C, R, N.

Also, E is at 3, which is a new position, and A at 4.

We know A is not at 3, but 4 is fine. E can be at 3.

So this could work.

Another option: ""LATTE"" but has double T, which reduces information, so better to avoid repeats.

""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. But E at 5 is invalid, so E will be yellow, which we know, so not ideal.

""PALET"" or ""PLATE"" with E at 5.

Better to avoid E at 5.

""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E at 2, but no A? We must include A because we know A is in the word. We have to include both A and E in the guess to confirm or get positions.

In the guess, we don't have to include them, but it's better to, because we know they are in the word, so we can try to find their positions.

If we don't include A or E, we might miss the chance to get them correct.

So, I think we should include both A and E in the guess.

Therefore, ""STEAL"" seems good: S, T, E, A, L.

Positions: E at 3, A at 4.

We can also consider ""SALET"", but ""SALET"" is S, A, L, E, T -> A at 2, E at 4? S-A-L-E-T, so 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. So A at 2, E at 4. Both positions are possible for A and E.

And we test S, L, T.

""SALET"" is a valid word, often used in Wordle.

But in ""SALET"", A is at 2, E at 4.

Similarly, ""STEAL"" has E at 3, A at 4.

Both are fine.

I think I'll go with ""STEAL"" to test E at position 3 and A at position 4.

So, guess: STEAL

But let's confirm the letters: S, T, E, A, L — none of C, R, N, so good.

We also get to test S, T, L.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another common word: ""ALERT"", but R is not allowed, since R is absent.

""R"" is out, so no.

""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 is bad.

""ABLED"": A, B, L, E, D -> A at 1, E at 4. Good, but B and D are less common.

""STEAL"" seems better.

I think ""STEAL"" is a solid choice.

So, I'll guess ""steal"".

But in the output, it should be lowercase? Probably case doesn't matter, but I'll use lowercase for consistency.

In previous, I used ""crane"", so lowercase.

So, <guess>steal</guess>Based on the feedback from Guess 3 (""crane""):
- C, R, N are **absent** from the secret word.
- A and E are **present** but in the wrong positions (A not at position 3, E not at position 5).

For the new guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word).
- Must avoid C, R, N (since they are absent).
- A cannot be placed at position 3, and E cannot be placed at position 5 (to avoid redundant feedback).
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L) to maximize information gain.

The word ""steal"" is chosen because:
- It includes A and E (A at position 4, E at position 3—both valid positions based on feedback).
- It avoids C, R, N.
- It introduces three new common letters: S, T, L.
- All letters are distinct, ensuring efficient feedback.

This guess will help identify the positions of A and E while testing S, T, and L for presence/absence.

We have to include both A and E in the guess to confirm or get positions.\n\nIn the guess, we don\'t have to include them, but it\'s better to, because we know they are in the word, so we can try to find their positions.\n\nIf we don\'t include A or E, we might miss the chance to get them correct.\n\nSo, I think we should include both A and E in the guess.\n\nTherefore, ""STEAL"" seems good: S, T, E, A, L.\n\nPositions: E at 3, A at 4.\n\nWe can also consider ""SALET"", but ""SALET"" is S, A, L, E, T -> A at 2, E at 4? S-A-L-E-T, so 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. So A at 2, E at 4. Both positions are possible for A and E.\n\nAnd we test S, L, T.\n\n""SALET"" is a valid word, often used in Wordle.\n\nBut in ""SALET"", A is at 2, E at 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""STEAL"" has E at 3, A at 4.\n\nBoth are fine.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""STEAL"" to test E at position 3 and A at position 4.\n\nSo, guess: STEAL\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: S, T, E, A, L — none of C, R, N, so good.\n\nWe also get to test S, T, L.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAnother common word: ""ALERT"", but R is not allowed, since R is absent.\n\n""R"" is out, so no.\n\n""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 is bad.\n\n""ABLED"": A, B, L, E, D -> A at 1, E at 4. Good, but B and D are less common.\n\n""STEAL"" seems better.\n\nI think ""STEAL"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo, I\'ll guess ""steal"".\n\nBut in the output, it should be lowercase? Probably case doesn\'t matter, but I\'ll use lowercase for consistency.\n\nIn previous, I used ""crane"", so lowercase.\n\nSo, <guess>steal</guess>Based on the feedback from Guess 3 (""crane""):\n- C, R, N are **absent** from the secret word.\n- A and E are **present** but in the wrong positions (A not at position 3, E not at position 5).\n\nFor the new guess:\n- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word).\n- Must avoid C, R, N (since they are absent).\n- A cannot be placed at position 3, and E cannot be placed at position 5 (to avoid redundant feedback).\n- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L) to maximize information gain.\n\nThe word ""steal"" is chosen because:\n- It includes A and E (A at position 4, E at position 3—both valid positions based on feedback).\n- It avoids C, R, N.\n- It introduces three new common letters: S, T, L.\n- All letters are distinct, ensuring efficient feedback.\n\nThis guess will help identify the positions of A and E while testing S, T, and L for presence/absence.\n\n<guess>steal</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\nGuess 2: guessed-word</> but the guessed word should be an actual word, like \'crane\'.

That was a mistake.\n\nIn the response format, it says: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\nGuess 3: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 4: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are at Guess 4 feedback: S(x) T(-) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)

This means:
- S is absent (x) → not in the word at all.
- T is present but in the wrong position (-) → T is in the word, but not at position 2.
- E is correct and in the right position (✓) → E is at position 3.
- A is correct and in the right position (✓) → A is at position 4.
- L is absent (x) → not in the word.

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word has E at position 3 and A at position 4. So the word is _ _ E A _
- T is in the word, but not at position 2 (and since position 3 and 4 are taken by E and A, T must be at position 1 or 5? Positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is E, 4 is A, so T can be at 1, 2, or 5. But the feedback says T is in the word but not at position 2 (since we guessed T at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning wrong position). So T is not at 2, and cannot be at 3 or 4, so T must be at position 1 or 5.
- Also, S and L are absent, so the word does not contain S or L.

Additionally, from previous guess (crane), we know:
- C, R, N are absent (from Guess 3: C(x), R(x), N(x)).
- A and E are present (which we now have positions for).

So, overall absent letters: C, R, N, S, L.

Present letters: E (at 3), A (at 4), T (somewhere, not at 2, so at 1 or 5).

The word structure: _ _ E A _

We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 5.

Position 1: can be T or another letter, but T is a possibility.
Position 2: cannot be T (since T is not at 2), and must be a letter not absent.
Position 5: can be T or another letter.

But T must be in the word, so either at 1 or 5.

Also, we have to use only letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L.

So available letters: all except C, R, N, S, L.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we have T to place, and two other positions.

The word is _ _ E A _

With T at 1 or 5.

We need to find a valid English word that fits.

Also, position 2 must be filled with a letter that is not absent and not T (since T not at 2).

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: T at position 1.
Then word: T _ E A _
Position 2: must be a letter not absent and not T. Position 5: any letter not absent.

Case 2: T at position 5.
Then word: _ _ E A T
Position 1 and 2: letters not absent, and position 2 not T (but T is at 5, so position 2 is not T anyway).

We can think of common words that fit.

First, let's list possible words with _ _ E A _

And T at 1 or 5.

Common words ending with E A _ : but the pattern is _ _ E A _, so the last two are E A and then one more.

For example, if T is at 5: _ _ E A T

What words end with EAT? Like ""GREAT"", ""TREAT"", but R is absent, so no. ""SHEAT"" not a word. ""PLEAT"" but L is absent. ""CLEAT"" C and L absent.

With available letters: no R, no S, no L, no C, no N.

So for _ _ E A T, possible: 
- B E A T? But that's B E A T, which would be positions: 1:B, 2:E, but E is at position 3, not 2. The pattern is position 3 is E, so for _ _ E A T, position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: E, position 4: A, position 5: T.

So position 2 cannot be E because E is fixed at 3.

Similarly, position 1 and 2 must be different.

Possible words: 
- ""GREAT"": G R E A T → but R is absent.
- ""TREAT"": T R E A T → R absent, and double T but T at 1 and 5? ""TREAT"" has T at 1 and 5, but R is absent.
- ""PLEAT"": P L E A T → L absent.
- ""BLEAT"": B L E A T → L absent.
- ""CLEAT"": C L E A T → C and L absent.

All these have issues.

What about ""WHEAT"": W H E A T → H is not absent, W not absent. But we don't know about H or W yet. H and W are not in the absent list, so possible.

""WHEAT"": positions 1:W, 2:H, 3:E, 4:A, 5:T. This fits the pattern. And W and H are not marked absent.

Similarly, ""CHEAT"": but C is absent.

""THEAT"" not a word.

""KNEAD"": K N E A D → N absent, and position 4 is A, but in ""KNEAD"" it's K-N-E-A-D, so position 3 is E, 4 is A, 5 is D. But N is absent, so no.

Another one: ""DWELL"" but doesn't end with E A T.

Back to ""WHEAT"": it seems possible.

But we have position 2: in ""WHEAT"" it's H, which is not absent.

Now, the other case: T at position 1.

Then word: T _ E A _

Position 2: must be a letter, not absent, not T.

Position 5: a letter not absent.

For example, ""T _ E A _""

Common words: ""TREAD"" but R absent.

""TREAT"" but R absent and we have T at 1 and 5, but in this case T at 1, so position 5 is not T yet.

""T _ E A _"" so position 5 is unknown.

""TREAT"" would be T R E A T, but R absent and position 5 is T, which is possible, but R absent.

""TIDEA"" not a word.

""TEA"" is three letters.

""IDEAL"" but L absent and I at position 1? ""IDEAL"" is I-D-E-A-L, so position 1:I, 2:D, 3:E, 4:A, 5:L. But L is absent, so no.

""OCEAN"" but C and N absent.

""STEAM"" but S absent and we have E at 3, A at 4, so ""STEAM"" would be S-T-E-A-M, but S absent and T at position 2? In ""STEAM"", position 2 is T, but we have feedback that T is not at position 2 (from guess 4: T at position 2 was marked wrong position, so T is not at 2). But in ""STEAM"", T is at 2, which is invalid for the secret word. So not.

""STEAM"" is invalid because T cannot be at 2.

Similarly, ""DREAM"" R absent.

""BEADY"" but not ending with E A _ properly.

""BEADY"" is B-E-A-D-Y, so position 3 is A? No: 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y. But we need position 3 to be E and 4 to be A. So not.

We need position 3: E, position 4: A.

So for T at 1: T _ E A _

Possible words: 
- ""TUBEA"" not a word.
- ""TUPLE"" but L absent and position 4 is L? T-U-P-L-E, positions: 1:T,2:U,3:P,4:L,5:E → but we need E at 3 and A at 4, not matching.

""TIGER"" but R absent and position 3 is G? Not E.

I think it's hard to find with T at 1.

Another one: ""TOXIC"" but C absent and positions.

Perhaps T at 1 is less likely.

Let's list words ending with EA_ but with E at 3 and A at 4.

Since position 3 and 4 are fixed as E and A, we need words like ??EA?

With the first two and last one.

Common words: 
- AREA: but 4 letters.
- PLEA: 4 letters.
- FLEA: 4 letters.
- IDEA: I-D-E-A, 4 letters.

5-letter words: 
- UREA: not 5.
- OLEA: not common.

Better to think of the pattern.

Since we have E at 3 and A at 4, and T must be at 1 or 5.

From the feedback, T is present and not at 2, so only 1 or 5.

Now, if T at 5, word: _ _ E A T

We thought of ""WHEAT"": W-H-E-A-T, which is valid.

Are there others?

""WHEAT"" uses W and H.

Another one: ""CHEAT"" but C absent.

""SHEAT"" not a word.

""PHEAT"" not a word.

""THEAT"" not a word.

""KNEAD"" but N absent.

""BREAD"" R absent.

"" DREAD"" R absent.

""GREAT"" R absent.

So ""WHEAT"" seems a strong candidate.

If T at 1, word: T _ E A _

Possible words: 
- ""TREAT"" but R absent and position 5 T, but ""TREAT"" has T at 1 and 5, so if we have T at 1, position 5 must be filled, so ""TREAT"" is T-R-E-A-T, but R absent.
- ""TIDEA"" not word.
- ""TAPEA"" not word.
- ""TEAED"" not common, and E at position 3? T-E-A-E-D, not matching pattern.
- ""TMIEA"" no.

""TABLE"" but L absent and position 3 B? Not E.

I think T at 1 is difficult, so probably T is at 5.

Therefore, the word is likely _ _ E A T

With position 1 and 2 to fill, with letters not absent and not S,L,C,R,N, and not T (since T at 5, and position 2 cannot be T anyway).

Position 2 cannot be T, but T is at 5, so position 2 is a different letter.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, common words: ""WHEAT"" as above.

""WHEAT"" has W and H.

Another possibility: ""YEAST"" but S absent and position 3 A? Not E.

""HEART"" but R absent and position 3 A? Not E.

""DEALT"" but L absent and position 3 A? Not E.

""MEANT"" but N absent.

""PEACH"" but C absent and position 3 A? Not E.

So ""WHEAT"" seems the most common.

But is there ""X E A T"" or something? Unlikely.

""FEAST"" but S absent.

""BEAST"" S absent.

""LEAST"" S and L absent.

So ""WHEAT"" is a good candidate.

But we need to confirm if H and W are possible.

From absent letters, H and W are not excluded, so yes.

Perhaps ""OLEAT"" not common.

I think ""WHEAT"" is the word.

But we are to make a guess, not necessarily the solution.

We have to make a guess that could be the word or get more information.

Since we have three positions unknown, but with constraints.

Position 1: can be various, position 2: can be various.

In ""WHEAT"", position 1 is W, position 2 is H.

But there might be other possibilities.

For example, ""CHEAT"" but C absent.

""PHEAT"" not a word.

"" SHEAT"" not.

""WHEAT"" is one.

Another word: ""THETA"" but T at 1 and 5? ""THETA"" is T-H-E-T-A, so positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:E, 4:T, 5:A. But we need position 4 to be A, but here it's T, and position 5 is A. But in our pattern, position 4 is A, so ""THETA"" has E at 3, but A at 5, not at 4. So not matching.

We need position 4 to be A.

""DELTA"" but L absent and position 3 L? Not E.

I think ""WHEAT"" is a strong possibility.

But let's see if there are other words with T at 1.

For example, ""TEPID"" but no A, and positions.

""TAPIR"" R absent.

""TAXED"" but position 3 X? Not E.

""TAMED"" M and D, position 3 M? Not E.

Not working.

So probably T is at 5.

Therefore, the word is _ _ E A T

Now, for position 1 and 2, we need to guess.

We can guess ""wheat"" directly.

But if we are wrong, we get feedback.

Since we have only one guess left? No, we have 6 guesses total, we are at guess 5 now? Let's see:

Guess 1: invalid
Guess 2: invalid
Guess 3: crane
Guess 4: steal
So next is guess 5.

We have two guesses left, including this one.

But if we guess ""wheat"", it might be correct.

If not, we get feedback on W and H.

But to be safe, we could guess a word that tests more letters, but we have only two positions to fill, and many letters.

Position 1 and 2 are unknown.

We know T is at 5, E at 3, A at 4.

So the word is X Y E A T, with X and Y not in absent list.

Absent: C,R,N,S,L

So X and Y from the remaining alphabet.

Common possibilities: 
- W and H: WHEAT
- B and H: BHEAT not a word
- D and H: DHEAT not
- F and H: FHEAT not
- G and H: GHEAT not
- H and something: but H at position 1 or 2.

In ""WHEAT"", X=W, Y=H.

Other combinations: 
- H at position 1, then H _ E A T, like ""H E A T"" but 4 letters, or ""HEART"" R absent, ""HEIST"" S absent and position 3 I? Not E.

""HEFTY"" not E at 3.

So no common word with H at 1 for this pattern.

Similarly, if Y is other letters.

For example, ""P E A T"" not, ""MEAT"" 4 letters.

""YEAT"" not 5.

I think ""WHEAT"" is the only common word that fits.

Perhaps ""QUEAT"" not a word.

""JEWEL"" not.

So I think ""wheat"" is the best guess.

Moreover, in the context, it might be the word.

So I'll go with ""wheat"".

But let's confirm the feedback.

In guess 4, we have E at 3 correct, A at 4 correct, T present but not at 2, so if ""wheat"" is the word, then position 1: W, 2: H, 3: E, 4: A, 5: T.

T is at 5, which is a new position, not 2, so that matches.

And W and H are not absent, so it should be correct.

If not, we get feedback.

But I think it's likely.

To be thorough, is there another word?

""OLEATE"" too long.

""FEAST"" S absent.

No, I think ""wheat"" is it.

So guess: wheat

In lowercase: wheat

Output: <guess>wheat</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 3 (crane)**: C, R, and N are absent (x). A and E are present but in the wrong positions (-), meaning A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
- **Guess 4 (steal)**: S and L are absent (x). T is present but in the wrong position (-), meaning T is not at position 2. E is correct and in the right position (✓) at position 3. A is correct and in the right position (✓) at position 4.

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions**: E is confirmed at position 3, and A is confirmed at position 4. The secret word pattern is `_ _ E A _`.
- **Present letters**: T is in the word but not at position 2. Since positions 3 and 4 are fixed, T must be at position 1 or 5.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N (from Guess 3), and S, L (from Guess 4) are not in the word. Avoid using these.
- **Available letters**: Focus on common letters not yet tested, such as B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- The word must start or end with T (position 1 or 5) and include two new letters for positions 1, 2, and 5 (with one position taken by T).
- After evaluating possible words fitting `_ _ E A _` with T at 1 or 5, and considering common English words:
  - T at position 5 is more plausible (e.g., `_ _ E A T`), as T at position 1 yields few valid options (e.g., ""treat"" is invalid due to R being absent).
  - The word ""wheat"" (W H E A T) fits perfectly:
    - Position 3: E (✓)
    - Position 4: A (✓)
    - Position 5: T (which matches the requirement that T is present but not at position 2).
    - W and H are new, high-frequency letters not excluded by previous feedback.
- ""Wheat"" is a valid 5-letter word that tests the likely position of T while introducing two new letters (W and H). If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, the feedback will confirm/reject W and H, narrowing options for the final guess.

<guess>wheat</guess>",wheat,"We are at Guess 4 feedback: S(x) T(-) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)

This means:
- S is absent (x) → not in the word at all.
- T is present but in the wrong position (-) → T is in the word, but not at position 2.
- E is correct and in the right position (✓) → E is at position 3.
- A is correct and in the right position (✓) → A is at position 4.
- L is absent (x) → not in the word.

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word has E at position 3 and A at position 4. So the word is _ _ E A _
- T is in the word, but not at position 2 (and since position 3 and 4 are taken by E and A, T must be at position 1 or 5? Positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is E, 4 is A, so T can be at 1, 2, or 5. But the feedback says T is in the word but not at position 2 (since we guessed T at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning wrong position). So T is not at 2, and cannot be at 3 or 4, so T must be at position 1 or 5.
- Also, S and L are absent, so the word does not contain S or L.

Additionally, from previous guess (crane), we know:
- C, R, N are absent (from Guess 3: C(x), R(x), N(x)).
- A and E are present (which we now have positions for).

So, overall absent letters: C, R, N, S, L.

Present letters: E (at 3), A (at 4), T (somewhere, not at 2, so at 1 or 5).

The word structure: _ _ E A _

We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 5.

Position 1: can be T or another letter, but T is a possibility.
Position 2: cannot be T (since T is not at 2), and must be a letter not absent.
Position 5: can be T or another letter.

But T must be in the word, so either at 1 or 5.

Also, we have to use only letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L.

So available letters: all except C, R, N, S, L.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we have T to place, and two other positions.

The word is _ _ E A _

With T at 1 or 5.

We need to find a valid English word that fits.

Also, position 2 must be filled with a letter that is not absent and not T (since T not at 2).

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: T at position 1.
Then word: T _ E A _
Position 2: must be a letter not absent and not T. Position 5: any letter not absent.

Case 2: T at position 5.
Then word: _ _ E A T
Position 1 and 2: letters not absent, and position 2 not T (but T is at 5, so position 2 is not T anyway).

We can think of common words that fit.

First, let's list possible words with _ _ E A _

And T at 1 or 5.

Common words ending with E A _ : but the pattern is _ _ E A _, so the last two are E A and then one more.

For example, if T is at 5: _ _ E A T

What words end with EAT? Like ""GREAT"", ""TREAT"", but R is absent, so no. ""SHEAT"" not a word. ""PLEAT"" but L is absent. ""CLEAT"" C and L absent.

With available letters: no R, no S, no L, no C, no N.

So for _ _ E A T, possible: 
- B E A T? But that's B E A T, which would be positions: 1:B, 2:E, but E is at position 3, not 2. The pattern is position 3 is E, so for _ _ E A T, position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: E, position 4: A, position 5: T.

So position 2 cannot be E because E is fixed at 3.

Similarly, position 1 and 2 must be different.

Possible words: 
- ""GREAT"": G R E A T → but R is absent.
- ""TREAT"": T R E A T → R absent, and double T but T at 1 and 5? ""TREAT"" has T at 1 and 5, but R is absent.
- ""PLEAT"": P L E A T → L absent.
- ""BLEAT"": B L E A T → L absent.
- ""CLEAT"": C L E A T → C and L absent.

All these have issues.

What about ""WHEAT"": W H E A T → H is not absent, W not absent. But we don't know about H or W yet. H and W are not in the absent list, so possible.

""WHEAT"": positions 1:W, 2:H, 3:E, 4:A, 5:T. This fits the pattern. And W and H are not marked absent.

Similarly, ""CHEAT"": but C is absent.

""THEAT"" not a word.

""KNEAD"": K N E A D → N absent, and position 4 is A, but in ""KNEAD"" it's K-N-E-A-D, so position 3 is E, 4 is A, 5 is D. But N is absent, so no.

Another one: ""DWELL"" but doesn't end with E A T.

Back to ""WHEAT"": it seems possible.

But we have position 2: in ""WHEAT"" it's H, which is not absent.

Now, the other case: T at position 1.

Then word: T _ E A _

Position 2: must be a letter, not absent, not T.

Position 5: a letter not absent.

For example, ""T _ E A _""

Common words: ""TREAD"" but R absent.

""TREAT"" but R absent and we have T at 1 and 5, but in this case T at 1, so position 5 is not T yet.

""T _ E A _"" so position 5 is unknown.

""TREAT"" would be T R E A T, but R absent and position 5 is T, which is possible, but R absent.

""TIDEA"" not a word.

""TEA"" is three letters.

""IDEAL"" but L absent and I at position 1? ""IDEAL"" is I-D-E-A-L, so position 1:I, 2:D, 3:E, 4:A, 5:L. But L is absent, so no.

""OCEAN"" but C and N absent.

""STEAM"" but S absent and we have E at 3, A at 4, so ""STEAM"" would be S-T-E-A-M, but S absent and T at position 2? In ""STEAM"", position 2 is T, but we have feedback that T is not at position 2 (from guess 4: T at position 2 was marked wrong position, so T is not at 2). But in ""STEAM"", T is at 2, which is invalid for the secret word. So not.

""STEAM"" is invalid because T cannot be at 2.

Similarly, ""DREAM"" R absent.

""BEADY"" but not ending with E A _ properly.

""BEADY"" is B-E-A-D-Y, so position 3 is A? No: 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y. But we need position 3 to be E and 4 to be A. So not.

We need position 3: E, position 4: A.

So for T at 1: T _ E A _

Possible words: 
- ""TUBEA"" not a word.
- ""TUPLE"" but L absent and position 4 is L? T-U-P-L-E, positions: 1:T,2:U,3:P,4:L,5:E → but we need E at 3 and A at 4, not matching.

""TIGER"" but R absent and position 3 is G? Not E.

I think it's hard to find with T at 1.

Another one: ""TOXIC"" but C absent and positions.

Perhaps T at 1 is less likely.

Let's list words ending with EA_ but with E at 3 and A at 4.

Since position 3 and 4 are fixed as E and A, we need words like ??EA?

With the first two and last one.

Common words: 
- AREA: but 4 letters.
- PLEA: 4 letters.
- FLEA: 4 letters.
- IDEA: I-D-E-A, 4 letters.

5-letter words: 
- UREA: not 5.
- OLEA: not common.

Better to think of the pattern.

Since we have E at 3 and A at 4, and T must be at 1 or 5.

From the feedback, T is present and not at 2, so only 1 or 5.

Now, if T at 5, word: _ _ E A T

We thought of ""WHEAT"": W-H-E-A-T, which is valid.

Are there others?

""WHEAT"" uses W and H.

Another one: ""CHEAT"" but C absent.

""SHEAT"" not a word.

""PHEAT"" not a word.

""THEAT"" not a word.

""KNEAD"" but N absent.

""BREAD"" R absent.

"" DREAD"" R absent.

""GREAT"" R absent.

So ""WHEAT"" seems a strong candidate.

If T at 1, word: T _ E A _

Possible words: 
- ""TREAT"" but R absent and position 5 T, but ""TREAT"" has T at 1 and 5, so if we have T at 1, position 5 must be filled, so ""TREAT"" is T-R-E-A-T, but R absent.
- ""TIDEA"" not word.
- ""TAPEA"" not word.
- ""TEAED"" not common, and E at position 3? T-E-A-E-D, not matching pattern.
- ""TMIEA"" no.

""TABLE"" but L absent and position 3 B? Not E.

I think T at 1 is difficult, so probably T is at 5.

Therefore, the word is likely _ _ E A T

With position 1 and 2 to fill, with letters not absent and not S,L,C,R,N, and not T (since T at 5, and position 2 cannot be T anyway).

Position 2 cannot be T, but T is at 5, so position 2 is a different letter.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, common words: ""WHEAT"" as above.

""WHEAT"" has W and H.

Another possibility: ""YEAST"" but S absent and position 3 A? Not E.

""HEART"" but R absent and position 3 A? Not E.

""DEALT"" but L absent and position 3 A? Not E.

""MEANT"" but N absent.

""PEACH"" but C absent and position 3 A? Not E.

So ""WHEAT"" seems the most common.

But is there ""X E A T"" or something? Unlikely.

""FEAST"" but S absent.

""BEAST"" S absent.

""LEAST"" S and L absent.

So ""WHEAT"" is a good candidate.

But we need to confirm if H and W are possible.

From absent letters, H and W are not excluded, so yes.

Perhaps ""OLEAT"" not common.

I think ""WHEAT"" is the word.

But we are to make a guess, not necessarily the solution.

We have to make a guess that could be the word or get more information.

Since we have three positions unknown, but with constraints.

Position 1: can be various, position 2: can be various.

In ""WHEAT"", position 1 is W, position 2 is H.

But there might be other possibilities.

For example, ""CHEAT"" but C absent.

""PHEAT"" not a word.

"" SHEAT"" not.

""WHEAT"" is one.

Another word: ""THETA"" but T at 1 and 5? ""THETA"" is T-H-E-T-A, so positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:E, 4:T, 5:A. But we need position 4 to be A, but here it's T, and position 5 is A. But in our pattern, position 4 is A, so ""THETA"" has E at 3, but A at 5, not at 4. So not matching.

We need position 4 to be A.

""DELTA"" but L absent and position 3 L? Not E.

I think ""WHEAT"" is a strong possibility.

But let's see if there are other words with T at 1.

For example, ""TEPID"" but no A, and positions.

""TAPIR"" R absent.

""TAXED"" but position 3 X? Not E.

""TAMED"" M and D, position 3 M? Not E.

Not working.

So probably T is at 5.

Therefore, the word is _ _ E A T

Now, for position 1 and 2, we need to guess.

We can guess ""wheat"" directly.

But if we are wrong, we get feedback.

Since we have only one guess left? No, we have 6 guesses total, we are at guess 5 now? Let's see:

Guess 1: invalid
Guess 2: invalid
Guess 3: crane
Guess 4: steal
So next is guess 5.

We have two guesses left, including this one.

But if we guess ""wheat"", it might be correct.

If not, we get feedback on W and H.

But to be safe, we could guess a word that tests more letters, but we have only two positions to fill, and many letters.

Position 1 and 2 are unknown.

We know T is at 5, E at 3, A at 4.

So the word is X Y E A T, with X and Y not in absent list.

Absent: C,R,N,S,L

So X and Y from the remaining alphabet.

Common possibilities: 
- W and H: WHEAT
- B and H: BHEAT not a word
- D and H: DHEAT not
- F and H: FHEAT not
- G and H: GHEAT not
- H and something: but H at position 1 or 2.

In ""WHEAT"", X=W, Y=H.

Other combinations: 
- H at position 1, then H _ E A T, like ""H E A T"" but 4 letters, or ""HEART"" R absent, ""HEIST"" S absent and position 3 I? Not E.

""HEFTY"" not E at 3.

So no common word with H at 1 for this pattern.

Similarly, if Y is other letters.

For example, ""P E A T"" not, ""MEAT"" 4 letters.

""YEAT"" not 5.

I think ""WHEAT"" is the only common word that fits.

Perhaps ""QUEAT"" not a word.

""JEWEL"" not.

So I think ""wheat"" is the best guess.

Moreover, in the context, it might be the word.

So I'll go with ""wheat"".

But let's confirm the feedback.

In guess 4, we have E at 3 correct, A at 4 correct, T present but not at 2, so if ""wheat"" is the word, then position 1: W, 2: H, 3: E, 4: A, 5: T.

T is at 5, which is a new position, not 2, so that matches.

And W and H are not absent, so it should be correct.

If not, we get feedback.

But I think it's likely.

To be thorough, is there another word?

""OLEATE"" too long.

""FEAST"" S absent.

No, I think ""wheat"" is it.

So guess: wheat

In lowercase: wheat

Output: <guess>wheat</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 3 (crane)**: C, R, and N are absent (x). A and E are present but in the wrong positions (-), meaning A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
- **Guess 4 (steal)**: S and L are absent (x). T is present but in the wrong position (-), meaning T is not at position 2. E is correct and in the right position (✓) at position 3. A is correct and in the right position (✓) at position 4.

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions**: E is confirmed at position 3, and A is confirmed at position 4. The secret word pattern is `_ _ E A _`.
- **Present letters**: T is in the word but not at position 2. Since positions 3 and 4 are fixed, T must be at position 1 or 5.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N (from Guess 3), and S, L (from Guess 4) are not in the word. Avoid using these.
- **Available letters**: Focus on common letters not yet tested, such as B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- The word must start or end with T (position 1 or 5) and include two new letters for positions 1, 2, and 5 (with one position taken by T).
- After evaluating possible words fitting `_ _ E A _` with T at 1 or 5, and considering common English words:
  - T at position 5 is more plausible (e.g., `_ _ E A T`), as T at position 1 yields few valid options (e.g., ""treat"" is invalid due to R being absent).
  - The word ""wheat"" (W H E A T) fits perfectly:
    - Position 3: E (✓)
    - Position 4: A (✓)
    - Position 5: T (which matches the requirement that T is present but not at position 2).
    - W and H are new, high-frequency letters not excluded by previous feedback.
- ""Wheat"" is a valid 5-letter word that tests the likely position of T while introducing two new letters (W and H). If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, the feedback will confirm/reject W and H, narrowing options for the final guess.",Guess 5: wheat -> FEEDBACK: W(-) H(x) E(✓) A(✓) T(-),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make my first guess for the Wordle game. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior information, so I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get.

I recall that in Wordle, it's often recommended to start with a word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants. This helps in eliminating or confirming multiple letters at once.

Common English vowels are A, E, I, O, U. Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are also frequent.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it includes common letters: C, R, A, N, E. That covers three vowels (A and E) and common consonants.

Another good one is ""SLATE"" with S, L, A, T, E—again, multiple vowels and common consonants.

I should avoid words with repeated letters since that reduces the information from a single guess.

Checking E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C—these are among the most common letters in English words.

""SOARE"" is sometimes used, but ""SOARE"" isn't very common; it might not be in the word list.

I need to stick to valid 5-letter English words.

For practicality, I'll go with ""CRANE"". Let me confirm: C-R-A-N-E.

- C: some common words

- R: very common

- A: most common vowel

- N: common consonant

- E: most common vowel

""CRANE"" has no repeated letters, so each position gives unique information.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is good with R, A, I, S, E—three vowels and two consonants.

But ""CRANE"" feels fine.

I could consider word frequency. For example, ""SALET"" is another one, but less common.

I'll stick with ""CRANE"" for my first guess.

After this guess, I'll get feedback like ✓, -, or x for each letter, which I can use for subsequent guesses.

But for now, since it's the first guess, I just need to output my guess.

So, I should think step by step, then provide the guess.

Thought process: I choose ""CRANE"" because it's a strong starter in Wordle, covering multiple common letters without repeats to maximize information gain.

Finally, format as specified: with <guess>guessed-word</guess> tags.For the first guess, I need to select a valid 5-letter English word that maximizes informational value. Common Wordle strategies suggest starting with words that include frequent letters (like vowels and common consonants) to cover more possibilities and reduce uncertainty quickly. Ideally, the word should have no repeated letters to gain the most feedback per guess.

After considering options:
- **CRANE** is a strong choice because it contains three vowels (A and E, with E being the most common English vowel) and common consonants (C, R, N). It's a high-information word used by many players to test key letters early.
- Alternatives like ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"" are also good, but ""CRANE"" provides a balanced mix and is widely accepted as an effective starter.

This guess will give feedback on five distinct letters, helping to narrow down the secret word significantly for subsequent guesses.

<guess>guessed-word</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess, but the previous feedback says that the guessed-word was not five letters. That means there was an error in the previous response format.

Let me check the previous response:
I returned: <guess>guessed-word</> but the guessed word should be an actual word, like 'crane'. In the previous thought, I intended to guess 'crane', but in the tags I wrote ""guessed-word"" as a placeholder? That was a mistake.

In the response format, it says: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.""

I think ""guessed-word"" was meant to be replaced by the actual word, e.g., <guess>crane</guess>.

However, in my first response, I wrote: ""<guess>guessed-word</guess>"" literally, and the feedback says ""Model answer is not five letters"" because ""guessed-word"" is more than five letters and not a valid word? Actually, ""guessed-word"" isn't a five-letter word; it's 12 letters including the hyphen? But clearly, that was a placeholder. So I must have messed up the response.

Now, the system is asking me to make a new guess after that feedback. But since the first guess was invalid, I need to start over with a valid first guess.

So now, I must make a valid first guess with an actual 5-letter word.

Let me redo:

Step-by-step thought:
- For the first guess, I choose a word that maximizes information.
- ""CRANE"" is a good choice: 5 letters, all distinct, with common vowels and consonants.
- Other options: ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", ""RAISE"", etc., but ""CRANE"" is standard.

Therefore, I will guess ""CRANE"".

Then, output in the correct format: <guess>crane</guess>It seems there was a mistake in the previous guess format—""guessed-word"" was a placeholder, not an actual word. I'll make a valid first guess now. For maximum informational value, I choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains 5 distinct letters.
- It uses common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N).
- Testing these high-frequency letters early helps narrow possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>guessed-word</> but the guessed word should be an actual word, like 'crane'. In the previous thought, I intended to guess 'crane', but in the tags I wrote ""guessed-word"" as a placeholder? That was a mistake.

In the response format, it says: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: guessed-word</> but the guessed word should be an actual word, like 'crane'. In the previous thought, I intended to guess 'crane', but in the tags I wrote ""guessed-word"" as a placeholder? That was a mistake.

In the response format, it says: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are in a Wordle game. The previous two attempts to guess were invalid because I used ""guessed-word"" as a placeholder instead of an actual word. Now, I must make a valid first guess with a real 5-letter word.

I need to choose a word that is exactly 5 letters long and is a valid English word. I should pick a word that has common letters to maximize the information from the feedback.

Common starting words in Wordle include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- RAISE
- ROAST
- SALET

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it is a standard choice. It has the letters C, R, A, N, E — which are all common and include two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

This time, I will output the guess in the correct format: <guess>crane</guess>

Let me make sure: ""crane"" is 5 letters, and it's a valid word.

So, my response should be:
<guess>crane</guess>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: guessed-word</> but the guessed word should be an actual word, like 'crane'. In the previous thought, I intended to guess 'crane', but in the tags I wrote ""guessed-word"" as a placeholder? That was a mistake.

In the response format, it says: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are playing Wordle. After three guesses, we have feedback from the third guess ""crane"":
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So, from guess 3:
- A and E are present in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 3 and 5 respectively).
- C, R, N are not in the word at all.

Now, we need to make a new guess (which will be the fourth guess overall, but effectively the first with feedback).

Constraints from previous feedback:
- The secret word contains A and E, but not in positions 3 or 5 (since in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and E at position 5, and they are marked as wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain C, R, or N.

We also know that the word is 5 letters.

We need to choose a word that:
- Includes A and E (since they are present)
- Does not include C, R, N (since they are absent)
- Places A and E in positions different from 3 and 5.

Additionally, we should try to cover new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

We have two known letters: A and E must be in the word, but not at pos 3 or 5.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4 (since not 3, and positions are 1-based? In ""crane"", A was at index 3, which is the third position. Let's clarify indexing: usually, positions are 1 to 5 from left to right.

In ""crane"":
Position 1: C
Position 2: R
Position 3: A
Position 4: N
Position 5: E

So, A cannot be at position 3, and E cannot be at position 5.

Therefore, A can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.
E can be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

We also need to avoid C, R, N.

Now, for the new guess, we should try to place A and E in new positions and include other common letters.

Let's think of words that have A and E, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

A good word might be ""SLATE"", but let's check:
- S, L, A, T, E
But we have A and E, and we can test S, L, T.

However, in ""SLATE"", A is at position 3 and E at position 5. But from feedback, A cannot be at position 3? No, the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3, so in the secret word, A is not at 3. Similarly, E is not at 5.

But in ""SLATE"", if we put A at 3 and E at 5, that might be okay for the guess because we are testing, but actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at 3 and E is not at 5, so if we guess ""SLATE"", we are putting A in a position we know is wrong, which might not be efficient. But it could still be useful to test other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that places A and E in positions that are still possible.

For example, put A at position 1 or 2 or 4, and E at 1,2,3,4.

Let's list possible words.

We can also consider that we have two letters to place: A and E.

To maximize information, we should include three new letters.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, D, U, M, P, etc.

A word with A and E and three new consonants.

For example:
- If we put A at position 1: words like A _ _ _ E, but E cannot be at 5? E can be at 5? No, E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word? Let's clarify.

The feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. So in the secret word, E is present, but not at position 5. So E can be at 1,2,3, or 4.

Similarly, A can be at 1,2,4 (not 3).

So for the secret word, position 3 cannot be A, and position 5 cannot be E.

Now, for our guess, we can put A and E anywhere to test, but it's better to put them in positions that are still possible to get direct hits.

For example, if we put A at position 1, and it's correct, we get a green. Similarly for E.

But we don't know, so we should spread them.

Let's think of a word that has A and E, avoids C,R,N, and has common other letters.

Possible words:
- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. But E at 5: we know E is not at 5 in the secret word, so if we put E at 5 in the guess, it will likely be marked as wrong position (if E is present) or we might get feedback that it's not there, but we know E is present, so it will be marked as wrong position. But that doesn't give new information because we already know E is not at 5. So it's a bit wasteful.

Better to put E in a position that could be correct, like 1,2,3,4.

Similarly for A.

So, let's avoid putting A at 3 or E at 5 in our guess, to potentially get a green.

For example, put A at position 1 or 2 or 4, and E at 1,2,3,4.

A word like ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at 3, E at 5. But A at 3: we know A is not at 3 in secret, so if we put A at 3, it will be marked as wrong position (yellow) which we already know, so no new info. Similarly, E at 5 will be yellow, which we know. So we only get info on P, L, T.

But we can do better.

How about ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T -> E at 2, A at 3. But A at 3 is invalid for secret, so A will be yellow, and E at 2 might be good.

In ""LEAST"":
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: T

But we know A cannot be at 3, so if we guess this, position 3 will be yellow for A, which we know, so it doesn't help. E at 2 might be correct or not.

Similarly, ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> A at 3, E at 5, both in positions we know are wrong, so we only test S, T, L.

Not efficient.

Better to choose a word where A and E are in positions that could be correct.

For example, put A at position 1: words like ""ADIEU"", but ""ADIEU"" has D, I, E, U. E is at position 4? ""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U -> A at 1, E at 4.

Also, it has I and U, which are vowels, and D.

But we need to avoid R and N, which we are, and C is already out.

""ADIEU"" is a common Wordle word.

But let's see: A at position 1, which is possible. E at position 4, which is also possible (since E can be at 4).

And we test D, I, U.

But we have two vowels already, and adding I and U might not be the best for consonant coverage.

Another word: ""SLATE"" but with E not at 5. We need to move E.

How about ""STEAL"": S, T, E, A, L -> E at 3, A at 5? ""STEAL"": S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), L(5)? No: S-T-E-A-L, so positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:A, 5:L.

So A is at 4, E at 3.

Now, A at 4 is possible (since not 3), E at 3 is possible (since E can be at 3).

And we test S, T, L.

This seems good.

""STEAL"" has S, T, E, A, L.

Letters: S, T, E, A, L — all common, and we avoid C, R, N.

Also, E is at 3, which is a new position, and A at 4.

We know A is not at 3, but 4 is fine. E can be at 3.

So this could work.

Another option: ""LATTE"" but has double T, which reduces information, so better to avoid repeats.

""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. But E at 5 is invalid, so E will be yellow, which we know, so not ideal.

""PALET"" or ""PLATE"" with E at 5.

Better to avoid E at 5.

""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E at 2, but no A? We must include A because we know A is in the word. We have to include both A and E in the guess to confirm or get positions.

In the guess, we don't have to include them, but it's better to, because we know they are in the word, so we can try to find their positions.

If we don't include A or E, we might miss the chance to get them correct.

So, I think we should include both A and E in the guess.

Therefore, ""STEAL"" seems good: S, T, E, A, L.

Positions: E at 3, A at 4.

We can also consider ""SALET"", but ""SALET"" is S, A, L, E, T -> A at 2, E at 4? S-A-L-E-T, so 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. So A at 2, E at 4. Both positions are possible for A and E.

And we test S, L, T.

""SALET"" is a valid word, often used in Wordle.

But in ""SALET"", A is at 2, E at 4.

Similarly, ""STEAL"" has E at 3, A at 4.

Both are fine.

I think I'll go with ""STEAL"" to test E at position 3 and A at position 4.

So, guess: STEAL

But let's confirm the letters: S, T, E, A, L — none of C, R, N, so good.

We also get to test S, T, L.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another common word: ""ALERT"", but R is not allowed, since R is absent.

""R"" is out, so no.

""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 is bad.

""ABLED"": A, B, L, E, D -> A at 1, E at 4. Good, but B and D are less common.

""STEAL"" seems better.

I think ""STEAL"" is a solid choice.

So, I'll guess ""steal"".

But in the output, it should be lowercase? Probably case doesn't matter, but I'll use lowercase for consistency.

In previous, I used ""crane"", so lowercase.

So, <guess>steal</guess>Based on the feedback from Guess 3 (""crane""):
- C, R, N are **absent** from the secret word.
- A and E are **present** but in the wrong positions (A not at position 3, E not at position 5).

For the new guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word).
- Must avoid C, R, N (since they are absent).
- A cannot be placed at position 3, and E cannot be placed at position 5 (to avoid redundant feedback).
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L) to maximize information gain.

The word ""steal"" is chosen because:
- It includes A and E (A at position 4, E at position 3—both valid positions based on feedback).
- It avoids C, R, N.
- It introduces three new common letters: S, T, L.
- All letters are distinct, ensuring efficient feedback.

This guess will help identify the positions of A and E while testing S, T, and L for presence/absence.

Guess 2: guessed-word</> but the guessed word should be an actual word, like 'crane'. In the previous thought, I intended to guess 'crane', but in the tags I wrote ""guessed-word"" as a placeholder? That was a mistake.

In the response format, it says: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 4: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are at Guess 4 feedback: S(x) T(-) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)

This means:
- S is absent (x) → not in the word at all.
- T is present but in the wrong position (-) → T is in the word, but not at position 2.
- E is correct and in the right position (✓) → E is at position 3.
- A is correct and in the right position (✓) → A is at position 4.
- L is absent (x) → not in the word.

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word has E at position 3 and A at position 4. So the word is _ _ E A _
- T is in the word, but not at position 2 (and since position 3 and 4 are taken by E and A, T must be at position 1 or 5? Positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is E, 4 is A, so T can be at 1, 2, or 5. But the feedback says T is in the word but not at position 2 (since we guessed T at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning wrong position). So T is not at 2, and cannot be at 3 or 4, so T must be at position 1 or 5.
- Also, S and L are absent, so the word does not contain S or L.

Additionally, from previous guess (crane), we know:
- C, R, N are absent (from Guess 3: C(x), R(x), N(x)).
- A and E are present (which we now have positions for).

So, overall absent letters: C, R, N, S, L.

Present letters: E (at 3), A (at 4), T (somewhere, not at 2, so at 1 or 5).

The word structure: _ _ E A _

We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 5.

Position 1: can be T or another letter, but T is a possibility.
Position 2: cannot be T (since T is not at 2), and must be a letter not absent.
Position 5: can be T or another letter.

But T must be in the word, so either at 1 or 5.

Also, we have to use only letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L.

So available letters: all except C, R, N, S, L.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we have T to place, and two other positions.

The word is _ _ E A _

With T at 1 or 5.

We need to find a valid English word that fits.

Also, position 2 must be filled with a letter that is not absent and not T (since T not at 2).

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: T at position 1.
Then word: T _ E A _
Position 2: must be a letter not absent and not T. Position 5: any letter not absent.

Case 2: T at position 5.
Then word: _ _ E A T
Position 1 and 2: letters not absent, and position 2 not T (but T is at 5, so position 2 is not T anyway).

We can think of common words that fit.

First, let's list possible words with _ _ E A _

And T at 1 or 5.

Common words ending with E A _ : but the pattern is _ _ E A _, so the last two are E A and then one more.

For example, if T is at 5: _ _ E A T

What words end with EAT? Like ""GREAT"", ""TREAT"", but R is absent, so no. ""SHEAT"" not a word. ""PLEAT"" but L is absent. ""CLEAT"" C and L absent.

With available letters: no R, no S, no L, no C, no N.

So for _ _ E A T, possible: 
- B E A T? But that's B E A T, which would be positions: 1:B, 2:E, but E is at position 3, not 2. The pattern is position 3 is E, so for _ _ E A T, position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: E, position 4: A, position 5: T.

So position 2 cannot be E because E is fixed at 3.

Similarly, position 1 and 2 must be different.

Possible words: 
- ""GREAT"": G R E A T → but R is absent.
- ""TREAT"": T R E A T → R absent, and double T but T at 1 and 5? ""TREAT"" has T at 1 and 5, but R is absent.
- ""PLEAT"": P L E A T → L absent.
- ""BLEAT"": B L E A T → L absent.
- ""CLEAT"": C L E A T → C and L absent.

All these have issues.

What about ""WHEAT"": W H E A T → H is not absent, W not absent. But we don't know about H or W yet. H and W are not in the absent list, so possible.

""WHEAT"": positions 1:W, 2:H, 3:E, 4:A, 5:T. This fits the pattern. And W and H are not marked absent.

Similarly, ""CHEAT"": but C is absent.

""THEAT"" not a word.

""KNEAD"": K N E A D → N absent, and position 4 is A, but in ""KNEAD"" it's K-N-E-A-D, so position 3 is E, 4 is A, 5 is D. But N is absent, so no.

Another one: ""DWELL"" but doesn't end with E A T.

Back to ""WHEAT"": it seems possible.

But we have position 2: in ""WHEAT"" it's H, which is not absent.

Now, the other case: T at position 1.

Then word: T _ E A _

Position 2: must be a letter, not absent, not T.

Position 5: a letter not absent.

For example, ""T _ E A _""

Common words: ""TREAD"" but R absent.

""TREAT"" but R absent and we have T at 1 and 5, but in this case T at 1, so position 5 is not T yet.

""T _ E A _"" so position 5 is unknown.

""TREAT"" would be T R E A T, but R absent and position 5 is T, which is possible, but R absent.

""TIDEA"" not a word.

""TEA"" is three letters.

""IDEAL"" but L absent and I at position 1? ""IDEAL"" is I-D-E-A-L, so position 1:I, 2:D, 3:E, 4:A, 5:L. But L is absent, so no.

""OCEAN"" but C and N absent.

""STEAM"" but S absent and we have E at 3, A at 4, so ""STEAM"" would be S-T-E-A-M, but S absent and T at position 2? In ""STEAM"", position 2 is T, but we have feedback that T is not at position 2 (from guess 4: T at position 2 was marked wrong position, so T is not at 2). But in ""STEAM"", T is at 2, which is invalid for the secret word. So not.

""STEAM"" is invalid because T cannot be at 2.

Similarly, ""DREAM"" R absent.

""BEADY"" but not ending with E A _ properly.

""BEADY"" is B-E-A-D-Y, so position 3 is A? No: 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y. But we need position 3 to be E and 4 to be A. So not.

We need position 3: E, position 4: A.

So for T at 1: T _ E A _

Possible words: 
- ""TUBEA"" not a word.
- ""TUPLE"" but L absent and position 4 is L? T-U-P-L-E, positions: 1:T,2:U,3:P,4:L,5:E → but we need E at 3 and A at 4, not matching.

""TIGER"" but R absent and position 3 is G? Not E.

I think it's hard to find with T at 1.

Another one: ""TOXIC"" but C absent and positions.

Perhaps T at 1 is less likely.

Let's list words ending with EA_ but with E at 3 and A at 4.

Since position 3 and 4 are fixed as E and A, we need words like ??EA?

With the first two and last one.

Common words: 
- AREA: but 4 letters.
- PLEA: 4 letters.
- FLEA: 4 letters.
- IDEA: I-D-E-A, 4 letters.

5-letter words: 
- UREA: not 5.
- OLEA: not common.

Better to think of the pattern.

Since we have E at 3 and A at 4, and T must be at 1 or 5.

From the feedback, T is present and not at 2, so only 1 or 5.

Now, if T at 5, word: _ _ E A T

We thought of ""WHEAT"": W-H-E-A-T, which is valid.

Are there others?

""WHEAT"" uses W and H.

Another one: ""CHEAT"" but C absent.

""SHEAT"" not a word.

""PHEAT"" not a word.

""THEAT"" not a word.

""KNEAD"" but N absent.

""BREAD"" R absent.

"" DREAD"" R absent.

""GREAT"" R absent.

So ""WHEAT"" seems a strong candidate.

If T at 1, word: T _ E A _

Possible words: 
- ""TREAT"" but R absent and position 5 T, but ""TREAT"" has T at 1 and 5, so if we have T at 1, position 5 must be filled, so ""TREAT"" is T-R-E-A-T, but R absent.
- ""TIDEA"" not word.
- ""TAPEA"" not word.
- ""TEAED"" not common, and E at position 3? T-E-A-E-D, not matching pattern.
- ""TMIEA"" no.

""TABLE"" but L absent and position 3 B? Not E.

I think T at 1 is difficult, so probably T is at 5.

Therefore, the word is likely _ _ E A T

With position 1 and 2 to fill, with letters not absent and not S,L,C,R,N, and not T (since T at 5, and position 2 cannot be T anyway).

Position 2 cannot be T, but T is at 5, so position 2 is a different letter.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, common words: ""WHEAT"" as above.

""WHEAT"" has W and H.

Another possibility: ""YEAST"" but S absent and position 3 A? Not E.

""HEART"" but R absent and position 3 A? Not E.

""DEALT"" but L absent and position 3 A? Not E.

""MEANT"" but N absent.

""PEACH"" but C absent and position 3 A? Not E.

So ""WHEAT"" seems the most common.

But is there ""X E A T"" or something? Unlikely.

""FEAST"" but S absent.

""BEAST"" S absent.

""LEAST"" S and L absent.

So ""WHEAT"" is a good candidate.

But we need to confirm if H and W are possible.

From absent letters, H and W are not excluded, so yes.

Perhaps ""OLEAT"" not common.

I think ""WHEAT"" is the word.

But we are to make a guess, not necessarily the solution.

We have to make a guess that could be the word or get more information.

Since we have three positions unknown, but with constraints.

Position 1: can be various, position 2: can be various.

In ""WHEAT"", position 1 is W, position 2 is H.

But there might be other possibilities.

For example, ""CHEAT"" but C absent.

""PHEAT"" not a word.

"" SHEAT"" not.

""WHEAT"" is one.

Another word: ""THETA"" but T at 1 and 5? ""THETA"" is T-H-E-T-A, so positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:E, 4:T, 5:A. But we need position 4 to be A, but here it's T, and position 5 is A. But in our pattern, position 4 is A, so ""THETA"" has E at 3, but A at 5, not at 4. So not matching.

We need position 4 to be A.

""DELTA"" but L absent and position 3 L? Not E.

I think ""WHEAT"" is a strong possibility.

But let's see if there are other words with T at 1.

For example, ""TEPID"" but no A, and positions.

""TAPIR"" R absent.

""TAXED"" but position 3 X? Not E.

""TAMED"" M and D, position 3 M? Not E.

Not working.

So probably T is at 5.

Therefore, the word is _ _ E A T

Now, for position 1 and 2, we need to guess.

We can guess ""wheat"" directly.

But if we are wrong, we get feedback.

Since we have only one guess left? No, we have 6 guesses total, we are at guess 5 now? Let's see:

Guess 1: invalid
Guess 2: invalid
Guess 3: crane
Guess 4: steal
So next is guess 5.

We have two guesses left, including this one.

But if we guess ""wheat"", it might be correct.

If not, we get feedback on W and H.

But to be safe, we could guess a word that tests more letters, but we have only two positions to fill, and many letters.

Position 1 and 2 are unknown.

We know T is at 5, E at 3, A at 4.

So the word is X Y E A T, with X and Y not in absent list.

Absent: C,R,N,S,L

So X and Y from the remaining alphabet.

Common possibilities: 
- W and H: WHEAT
- B and H: BHEAT not a word
- D and H: DHEAT not
- F and H: FHEAT not
- G and H: GHEAT not
- H and something: but H at position 1 or 2.

In ""WHEAT"", X=W, Y=H.

Other combinations: 
- H at position 1, then H _ E A T, like ""H E A T"" but 4 letters, or ""HEART"" R absent, ""HEIST"" S absent and position 3 I? Not E.

""HEFTY"" not E at 3.

So no common word with H at 1 for this pattern.

Similarly, if Y is other letters.

For example, ""P E A T"" not, ""MEAT"" 4 letters.

""YEAT"" not 5.

I think ""WHEAT"" is the only common word that fits.

Perhaps ""QUEAT"" not a word.

""JEWEL"" not.

So I think ""wheat"" is the best guess.

Moreover, in the context, it might be the word.

So I'll go with ""wheat"".

But let's confirm the feedback.

In guess 4, we have E at 3 correct, A at 4 correct, T present but not at 2, so if ""wheat"" is the word, then position 1: W, 2: H, 3: E, 4: A, 5: T.

T is at 5, which is a new position, not 2, so that matches.

And W and H are not absent, so it should be correct.

If not, we get feedback.

But I think it's likely.

To be thorough, is there another word?

""OLEATE"" too long.

""FEAST"" S absent.

No, I think ""wheat"" is it.

So guess: wheat

In lowercase: wheat

Output: <guess>wheat</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 3 (crane)**: C, R, and N are absent (x). A and E are present but in the wrong positions (-), meaning A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
- **Guess 4 (steal)**: S and L are absent (x). T is present but in the wrong position (-), meaning T is not at position 2. E is correct and in the right position (✓) at position 3. A is correct and in the right position (✓) at position 4.

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions**: E is confirmed at position 3, and A is confirmed at position 4. The secret word pattern is `_ _ E A _`.
- **Present letters**: T is in the word but not at position 2. Since positions 3 and 4 are fixed, T must be at position 1 or 5.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N (from Guess 3), and S, L (from Guess 4) are not in the word. Avoid using these.
- **Available letters**: Focus on common letters not yet tested, such as B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- The word must start or end with T (position 1 or 5) and include two new letters for positions 1, 2, and 5 (with one position taken by T).
- After evaluating possible words fitting `_ _ E A _` with T at 1 or 5, and considering common English words:
  - T at position 5 is more plausible (e.g., `_ _ E A T`), as T at position 1 yields few valid options (e.g., ""treat"" is invalid due to R being absent).
  - The word ""wheat"" (W H E A T) fits perfectly:
    - Position 3: E (✓)
    - Position 4: A (✓)
    - Position 5: T (which matches the requirement that T is present but not at position 2).
    - W and H are new, high-frequency letters not excluded by previous feedback.
- ""Wheat"" is a valid 5-letter word that tests the likely position of T while introducing two new letters (W and H). If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, the feedback will confirm/reject W and H, narrowing options for the final guess.

Let\'s clarify indexing: usually, positions are 1 to 5 from left to right.\n\nIn ""crane"":\nPosition 1: C\nPosition 2: R\nPosition 3: A\nPosition 4: N\nPosition 5: E\n\nSo, A cannot be at position 3, and E cannot be at position 5.\n\nTherefore, A can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.\nE can be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).\n\nWe also need to avoid C, R, N.\n\nNow, for the new guess, we should try to place A and E in new positions and include other common letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A and E, and avoid C, R, N.\n\nCommon letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nA good word might be ""SLATE"", but let\'s check:\n- S, L, A, T, E\nBut we have A and E, and we can test S, L, T.\n\nHowever, in ""SLATE"", A is at position 3 and E at position 5. But from feedback, A cannot be at position 3? No, the feedback says A is in the word but not at position 3, so in the secret word, A is not at 3. Similarly, E is not at 5.\n\nBut in ""SLATE"", if we put A at 3 and E at 5, that might be okay for the guess because we are testing, but actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at 3 and E is not at 5, so if we guess ""SLATE"", we are putting A in a position we know is wrong, which might not be efficient. But it could still be useful to test other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that places A and E in positions that are still possible.\n\nFor example, put A at position 1 or 2 or 4, and E at 1,2,3,4.\n\nLet\'s list possible words.\n\nWe can also consider that we have two letters to place: A and E.\n\nTo maximize information, we should include three new letters.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, I, O, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nA word with A and E and three new consonants.\n\nFor example:\n- If we put A at position 1: words like A _ _ _ E, but E cannot be at 5? E can be at 5? No, E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word? Let\'s clarify.\n\nThe feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. So in the secret word, E is present, but not at position 5. So E can be at 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, A can be at 1,2,4 (not 3).\n\nSo for the secret word, position 3 cannot be A, and position 5 cannot be E.\n\nNow, for our guess, we can put A and E anywhere to test, but it\'s better to put them in positions that are still possible to get direct hits.\n\nFor example, if we put A at position 1, and it\'s correct, we get a green. Similarly for E.\n\nBut we don\'t know, so we should spread them.\n\nLet\'s think of a word that has A and E, avoids C,R,N, and has common other letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. But E at 5: we know E is not at 5 in the secret word, so if we put E at 5 in the guess, it will likely be marked as wrong position (if E is present) or we might get feedback that it\'s not there, but we know E is present, so it will be marked as wrong position. But that doesn\'t give new information because we already know E is not at 5. So it\'s a bit wasteful.\n\nBetter to put E in a position that could be correct, like 1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly for A.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid putting A at 3 or E at 5 in our guess, to potentially get a green.\n\nFor example, put A at position 1 or 2 or 4, and E at 1,2,3,4.\n\nA word like ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at 3, E at 5. But A at 3: we know A is not at 3 in secret, so if we put A at 3, it will be marked as wrong position (yellow) which we already know, so no new info. Similarly, E at 5 will be yellow, which we know. So we only get info on P, L, T.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nHow about ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T -> E at 2, A at 3. But A at 3 is invalid for secret, so A will be yellow, and E at 2 might be good.\n\nIn ""LEAST"":\n- Position 1: L\n- Position 2: E\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: T\n\nBut we know A cannot be at 3, so if we guess this, position 3 will be yellow for A, which we know, so it doesn\'t help. E at 2 might be correct or not.\n\nSimilarly, ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> A at 3, E at 5, both in positions we know are wrong, so we only test S, T, L.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nBetter to choose a word where A and E are in positions that could be correct.\n\nFor example, put A at position 1: words like ""ADIEU"", but ""ADIEU"" has D, I, E, U. E is at position 4? ""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U -> A at 1, E at 4.\n\nAlso, it has I and U, which are vowels, and D.\n\nBut we need to avoid R and N, which we are, and C is already out.\n\n""ADIEU"" is a common Wordle word.\n\nBut let\'s see: A at position 1, which is possible. E at position 4, which is also possible (since E can be at 4).\n\nAnd we test D, I, U.\n\nBut we have two vowels already, and adding I and U might not be the best for consonant coverage.\n\nAnother word: ""SLATE"" but with E not at 5. We need to move E.\n\nHow about ""STEAL"": S, T, E, A, L -> E at 3, A at 5? ""STEAL"": S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), L(5)? No: S-T-E-A-L, so positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:A, 5:L.\n\nSo A is at 4, E at 3.\n\nNow, A at 4 is possible (since not 3), E at 3 is possible (since E can be at 3).\n\nAnd we test S, T, L.\n\nThis seems good.\n\n""STEAL"" has S, T, E, A, L.\n\nLetters: S, T, E, A, L — all common, and we avoid C, R, N.\n\nAlso, E is at 3, which is a new position, and A at 4.\n\nWe know A is not at 3, but 4 is fine. E can be at 3.\n\nSo this could work.\n\nAnother option: ""LATTE"" but has double T, which reduces information, so better to avoid repeats.\n\n""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. But E at 5 is invalid, so E will be yellow, which we know, so not ideal.\n\n""PALET"" or ""PLATE"" with E at 5.\n\nBetter to avoid E at 5.\n\n""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E at 2, but no A? We must include A because we know A is in the word. We have to include both A and E in the guess to confirm or get positions.\n\nIn the guess, we don\'t have to include them, but it\'s better to, because we know they are in the word, so we can try to find their positions.\n\nIf we don\'t include A or E, we might miss the chance to get them correct.\n\nSo, I think we should include both A and E in the guess.\n\nTherefore, ""STEAL"" seems good: S, T, E, A, L.\n\nPositions: E at 3, A at 4.\n\nWe can also consider ""SALET"", but ""SALET"" is S, A, L, E, T -> A at 2, E at 4? S-A-L-E-T, so 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. So A at 2, E at 4. Both positions are possible for A and E.\n\nAnd we test S, L, T.\n\n""SALET"" is a valid word, often used in Wordle.\n\nBut in ""SALET"", A is at 2, E at 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""STEAL"" has E at 3, A at 4.\n\nBoth are fine.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""STEAL"" to test E at position 3 and A at position 4.\n\nSo, guess: STEAL\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: S, T, E, A, L — none of C, R, N, so good.\n\nWe also get to test S, T, L.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAnother common word: ""ALERT"", but R is not allowed, since R is absent.\n\n""R"" is out, so no.\n\n""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 is bad.\n\n""ABLED"": A, B, L, E, D -> A at 1, E at 4. Good, but B and D are less common.\n\n""STEAL"" seems better.\n\nI think ""STEAL"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo, I\'ll guess ""steal"".\n\nBut in the output, it should be lowercase? Probably case doesn\'t matter, but I\'ll use lowercase for consistency.\n\nIn previous, I used ""crane"", so lowercase.\n\nSo, <guess>steal</guess>Based on the feedback from Guess 3 (""crane""):\n- C, R, N are **absent** from the secret word.\n- A and E are **present** but in the wrong positions (A not at position 3, E not at position 5).\n\nFor the new guess:\n- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word).\n- Must avoid C, R, N (since they are absent).\n- A cannot be placed at position 3, and E cannot be placed at position 5 (to avoid redundant feedback).\n- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L) to maximize information gain.\n\nThe word ""steal"" is chosen because:\n- It includes A and E (A at position 4, E at position 3—both valid positions based on feedback).\n- It avoids C, R, N.\n- It introduces three new common letters: S, T, L.\n- All letters are distinct, ensuring efficient feedback.\n\nThis guess will help identify the positions of A and E while testing S, T, and L for presence/absence.\n\n<guess>steal</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\nGuess 2: guessed-word</> but the guessed word should be an actual word, like \'crane\'. In the previous thought, I intended to guess \'crane\', but in the tags I wrote ""guessed-word"" as a placeholder? That was a mistake.\n\nIn the response format, it says: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\nGuess 3: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 4: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are at Guess 4 feedback: S(x) T(-) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)\n\nThis means:\n- S is absent (x) → not in the word at all.\n- T is present but in the wrong position (-) → T is in the word, but not at position 2.\n- E is correct and in the right position (✓) → E is at position 3.\n- A is correct and in the right position (✓) → A is at position 4.\n- L is absent (x) → not in the word.\n\nSo, from this, we know:\n- The secret word has E at position 3 and A at position 4. So the word is _ _ E A _\n- T is in the word, but not at position 2 (and since position 3 and 4 are taken by E and A, T must be at position 1 or 5? Positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is E, 4 is A, so T can be at 1, 2, or 5. But the feedback says T is in the word but not at position 2 (since we guessed T at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning wrong position). So T is not at 2, and cannot be at 3 or 4, so T must be at position 1 or 5.\n- Also, S and L are absent, so the word does not contain S or L.\n\nAdditionally, from previous guess (crane), we know:\n- C, R, N are absent (from Guess 3: C(x), R(x), N(x)).\n- A and E are present (which we now have positions for).\n\nSo, overall absent letters: C, R, N, S, L.\n\nPresent letters: E (at 3), A (at 4), T (somewhere, not at 2, so at 1 or 5).\n\nThe word structure: _ _ E A _\n\nWe need to fill positions 1, 2, and 5.\n\nPosition 1: can be T or another letter, but T is a possibility.\nPosition 2: cannot be T (since T is not at 2), and must be a letter not absent.\nPosition 5: can be T or another letter.\n\nBut T must be in the word, so either at 1 or 5.\n\nAlso, we have to use only letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, N, S, L.\n\nSo available letters: all except C, R, N, S, L.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we have T to place, and two other positions.\n\nThe word is _ _ E A _\n\nWith T at 1 or 5.\n\nWe need to find a valid English word that fits.\n\nAlso, position 2 must be filled with a letter that is not absent and not T (since T not at 2).\n\nLet\'s consider the two cases:\n\nCase 1: T at position 1.\nThen word: T _ E A _\nPosition 2: must be a letter not absent and not T. Position 5: any letter not absent.\n\nCase 2: T at position 5.\nThen word: _ _ E A T\nPosition 1 and 2: letters not absent, and position 2 not T (but T is at 5, so position 2 is not T anyway).\n\nWe can think of common words that fit.\n\nFirst, let\'s list possible words with _ _ E A _\n\nAnd T at 1 or 5.\n\nCommon words ending with E A _ : but the pattern is _ _ E A _, so the last two are E A and then one more.\n\nFor example, if T is at 5: _ _ E A T\n\nWhat words end with EAT? Like ""GREAT"", ""TREAT"", but R is absent, so no. ""SHEAT"" not a word. ""PLEAT"" but L is absent. ""CLEAT"" C and L absent.\n\nWith available letters: no R, no S, no L, no C, no N.\n\nSo for _ _ E A T, possible: \n- B E A T? But that\'s B E A T, which would be positions: 1:B, 2:E, but E is at position 3, not 2. The pattern is position 3 is E, so for _ _ E A T, position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: E, position 4: A, position 5: T.\n\nSo position 2 cannot be E because E is fixed at 3.\n\nSimilarly, position 1 and 2 must be different.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""GREAT"": G R E A T → but R is absent.\n- ""TREAT"": T R E A T → R absent, and double T but T at 1 and 5? ""TREAT"" has T at 1 and 5, but R is absent.\n- ""PLEAT"": P L E A T → L absent.\n- ""BLEAT"": B L E A T → L absent.\n- ""CLEAT"": C L E A T → C and L absent.\n\nAll these have issues.\n\nWhat about ""WHEAT"": W H E A T → H is not absent, W not absent. But we don\'t know about H or W yet. H and W are not in the absent list, so possible.\n\n""WHEAT"": positions 1:W, 2:H, 3:E, 4:A, 5:T. This fits the pattern. And W and H are not marked absent.\n\nSimilarly, ""CHEAT"": but C is absent.\n\n""THEAT"" not a word.\n\n""KNEAD"": K N E A D → N absent, and position 4 is A, but in ""KNEAD"" it\'s K-N-E-A-D, so position 3 is E, 4 is A, 5 is D. But N is absent, so no.\n\nAnother one: ""DWELL"" but doesn\'t end with E A T.\n\nBack to ""WHEAT"": it seems possible.\n\nBut we have position 2: in ""WHEAT"" it\'s H, which is not absent.\n\nNow, the other case: T at position 1.\n\nThen word: T _ E A _\n\nPosition 2: must be a letter, not absent, not T.\n\nPosition 5: a letter not absent.\n\nFor example, ""T _ E A _""\n\nCommon words: ""TREAD"" but R absent.\n\n""TREAT"" but R absent and we have T at 1 and 5, but in this case T at 1, so position 5 is not T yet.\n\n""T _ E A _"" so position 5 is unknown.\n\n""TREAT"" would be T R E A T, but R absent and position 5 is T, which is possible, but R absent.\n\n""TIDEA"" not a word.\n\n""TEA"" is three letters.\n\n""IDEAL"" but L absent and I at position 1? ""IDEAL"" is I-D-E-A-L, so position 1:I, 2:D, 3:E, 4:A, 5:L. But L is absent, so no.\n\n""OCEAN"" but C and N absent.\n\n""STEAM"" but S absent and we have E at 3, A at 4, so ""STEAM"" would be S-T-E-A-M, but S absent and T at position 2? In ""STEAM"", position 2 is T, but we have feedback that T is not at position 2 (from guess 4: T at position 2 was marked wrong position, so T is not at 2). But in ""STEAM"", T is at 2, which is invalid for the secret word. So not.\n\n""STEAM"" is invalid because T cannot be at 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""DREAM"" R absent.\n\n""BEADY"" but not ending with E A _ properly.\n\n""BEADY"" is B-E-A-D-Y, so position 3 is A? No: 1:B, 2:E, 3:A, 4:D, 5:Y. But we need position 3 to be E and 4 to be A. So not.\n\nWe need position 3: E, position 4: A.\n\nSo for T at 1: T _ E A _\n\nPossible words: \n- ""TUBEA"" not a word.\n- ""TUPLE"" but L absent and position 4 is L? T-U-P-L-E, positions: 1:T,2:U,3:P,4:L,5:E → but we need E at 3 and A at 4, not matching.\n\n""TIGER"" but R absent and position 3 is G? Not E.\n\nI think it\'s hard to find with T at 1.\n\nAnother one: ""TOXIC"" but C absent and positions.\n\nPerhaps T at 1 is less likely.\n\nLet\'s list words ending with EA_ but with E at 3 and A at 4.\n\nSince position 3 and 4 are fixed as E and A, we need words like ??EA?\n\nWith the first two and last one.\n\nCommon words: \n- AREA: but 4 letters.\n- PLEA: 4 letters.\n- FLEA: 4 letters.\n- IDEA: I-D-E-A, 4 letters.\n\n5-letter words: \n- UREA: not 5.\n- OLEA: not common.\n\nBetter to think of the pattern.\n\nSince we have E at 3 and A at 4, and T must be at 1 or 5.\n\nFrom the feedback, T is present and not at 2, so only 1 or 5.\n\nNow, if T at 5, word: _ _ E A T\n\nWe thought of ""WHEAT"": W-H-E-A-T, which is valid.\n\nAre there others?\n\n""WHEAT"" uses W and H.\n\nAnother one: ""CHEAT"" but C absent.\n\n""SHEAT"" not a word.\n\n""PHEAT"" not a word.\n\n""THEAT"" not a word.\n\n""KNEAD"" but N absent.\n\n""BREAD"" R absent.\n\n"" DREAD"" R absent.\n\n""GREAT"" R absent.\n\nSo ""WHEAT"" seems a strong candidate.\n\nIf T at 1, word: T _ E A _\n\nPossible words: \n- ""TREAT"" but R absent and position 5 T, but ""TREAT"" has T at 1 and 5, so if we have T at 1, position 5 must be filled, so ""TREAT"" is T-R-E-A-T, but R absent.\n- ""TIDEA"" not word.\n- ""TAPEA"" not word.\n- ""TEAED"" not common, and E at position 3? T-E-A-E-D, not matching pattern.\n- ""TMIEA"" no.\n\n""TABLE"" but L absent and position 3 B? Not E.\n\nI think T at 1 is difficult, so probably T is at 5.\n\nTherefore, the word is likely _ _ E A T\n\nWith position 1 and 2 to fill, with letters not absent and not S,L,C,R,N, and not T (since T at 5, and position 2 cannot be T anyway).\n\nPosition 2 cannot be T, but T is at 5, so position 2 is a different letter.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, common words: ""WHEAT"" as above.\n\n""WHEAT"" has W and H.\n\nAnother possibility: ""YEAST"" but S absent and position 3 A? Not E.\n\n""HEART"" but R absent and position 3 A? Not E.\n\n""DEALT"" but L absent and position 3 A? Not E.\n\n""MEANT"" but N absent.\n\n""PEACH"" but C absent and position 3 A? Not E.\n\nSo ""WHEAT"" seems the most common.\n\nBut is there ""X E A T"" or something? Unlikely.\n\n""FEAST"" but S absent.\n\n""BEAST"" S absent.\n\n""LEAST"" S and L absent.\n\nSo ""WHEAT"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut we need to confirm if H and W are possible.\n\nFrom absent letters, H and W are not excluded, so yes.\n\nPerhaps ""OLEAT"" not common.\n\nI think ""WHEAT"" is the word.\n\nBut we are to make a guess, not necessarily the solution.\n\nWe have to make a guess that could be the word or get more information.\n\nSince we have three positions unknown, but with constraints.\n\nPosition 1: can be various, position 2: can be various.\n\nIn ""WHEAT"", position 1 is W, position 2 is H.\n\nBut there might be other possibilities.\n\nFor example, ""CHEAT"" but C absent.\n\n""PHEAT"" not a word.\n\n"" SHEAT"" not.\n\n""WHEAT"" is one.\n\nAnother word: ""THETA"" but T at 1 and 5? ""THETA"" is T-H-E-T-A, so positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:E, 4:T, 5:A. But we need position 4 to be A, but here it\'s T, and position 5 is A. But in our pattern, position 4 is A, so ""THETA"" has E at 3, but A at 5, not at 4. So not matching.\n\nWe need position 4 to be A.\n\n""DELTA"" but L absent and position 3 L? Not E.\n\nI think ""WHEAT"" is a strong possibility.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are other words with T at 1.\n\nFor example, ""TEPID"" but no A, and positions.\n\n""TAPIR"" R absent.\n\n""TAXED"" but position 3 X? Not E.\n\n""TAMED"" M and D, position 3 M? Not E.\n\nNot working.\n\nSo probably T is at 5.\n\nTherefore, the word is _ _ E A T\n\nNow, for position 1 and 2, we need to guess.\n\nWe can guess ""wheat"" directly.\n\nBut if we are wrong, we get feedback.\n\nSince we have only one guess left? No, we have 6 guesses total, we are at guess 5 now? Let\'s see:\n\nGuess 1: invalid\nGuess 2: invalid\nGuess 3: crane\nGuess 4: steal\nSo next is guess 5.\n\nWe have two guesses left, including this one.\n\nBut if we guess ""wheat"", it might be correct.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on W and H.\n\nBut to be safe, we could guess a word that tests more letters, but we have only two positions to fill, and many letters.\n\nPosition 1 and 2 are unknown.\n\nWe know T is at 5, E at 3, A at 4.\n\nSo the word is X Y E A T, with X and Y not in absent list.\n\nAbsent: C,R,N,S,L\n\nSo X and Y from the remaining alphabet.\n\nCommon possibilities: \n- W and H: WHEAT\n- B and H: BHEAT not a word\n- D and H: DHEAT not\n- F and H: FHEAT not\n- G and H: GHEAT not\n- H and something: but H at position 1 or 2.\n\nIn ""WHEAT"", X=W, Y=H.\n\nOther combinations: \n- H at position 1, then H _ E A T, like ""H E A T"" but 4 letters, or ""HEART"" R absent, ""HEIST"" S absent and position 3 I? Not E.\n\n""HEFTY"" not E at 3.\n\nSo no common word with H at 1 for this pattern.\n\nSimilarly, if Y is other letters.\n\nFor example, ""P E A T"" not, ""MEAT"" 4 letters.\n\n""YEAT"" not 5.\n\nI think ""WHEAT"" is the only common word that fits.\n\nPerhaps ""QUEAT"" not a word.\n\n""JEWEL"" not.\n\nSo I think ""wheat"" is the best guess.\n\nMoreover, in the context, it might be the word.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""wheat"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback.\n\nIn guess 4, we have E at 3 correct, A at 4 correct, T present but not at 2, so if ""wheat"" is the word, then position 1: W, 2: H, 3: E, 4: A, 5: T.\n\nT is at 5, which is a new position, not 2, so that matches.\n\nAnd W and H are not absent, so it should be correct.\n\nIf not, we get feedback.\n\nBut I think it\'s likely.\n\nTo be thorough, is there another word?\n\n""OLEATE"" too long.\n\n""FEAST"" S absent.\n\nNo, I think ""wheat"" is it.\n\nSo guess: wheat\n\nIn lowercase: wheat\n\nOutput: <guess>wheat</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 3 (crane)**: C, R, and N are absent (x). A and E are present but in the wrong positions (-), meaning A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.\n- **Guess 4 (steal)**: S and L are absent (x). T is present but in the wrong position (-), meaning T is not at position 2. E is correct and in the right position (✓) at position 3.

We are given feedback for Guess 5: ""wheat"" -> Feedback: W(-) H(x) E(✓) A(✓) T(-)

Interpretation:
- W is present but in the wrong position (-). So W is in the secret word but not at position 1.
- H is absent (x). So H is not in the secret word.
- E is correct at position 3 (✓).
- A is correct at position 4 (✓).
- T is present but in the wrong position (-). So T is in the word but not at position 5.

Recall the known information from previous feedback:
- From Guess 4 (""steal""): 
  - E at position 3 is correct (✓).
  - A at position 4 is correct (✓).
  - T is present but not at position 2 (-).
- From Guess 3 (""crane""):
  - C, R, N are absent (x).
- From Guess 4: S and L are absent (x).
- From Guess 5: H is absent (x).

Therefore, absent letters: C, R, N, S, L, H.
Present letters: E (at pos3), A (at pos4), T (somewhere, not at pos2 or pos5), W (somewhere, not at pos1).

The secret word pattern: positions 3 and 4 are fixed as E and A: _ _ E A _

We need to determine positions 1, 2, and 5.

Constraints:
- T must be in the word but not at pos2, not at pos5 (from Guess 5: T not at pos5, and from Guess 4: T not at pos2). However, positions 3 and 4 are taken by E and A, so T must be at position 1. But wait: position 1 is the only one left? Positions 1, 2, 5 are open. But T cannot be at pos2 or pos5, so T must be at position 1.

But let's check:
The available positions for T: pos1, pos2, pos5 (since pos3 and pos4 are fixed). We know T is not at pos2 (from Guess 4) and not at pos5 (from Guess 5), so it must be at position 1.

So T must be at position 1: so the pattern starts with T: T _ E A _

Then for position 2 and 5.

Additionally, W is present but not at position 1 (since not at pos1 from Guess 5). Since position 1 is T, W can be at position 2 or 5.

The word pattern: T _ E A _

With W to be placed at position 2 or 5.

Position 5 is open.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L, H. Avoid these.

Now, we need to fill position 2 and 5 with letters from the available set, including W at one of them? Not necessarily, because W can be at position 2 or 5, and there might be another letter.

But we have W that must be placed in the word, either at position 2 or position 5.

Also, position 2 must be a letter not absent and not T (T is at 1).

Possible letters for position 2: anything not absent and not T, and since W must be somewhere, if it's not at position 2, then it must be at position 5.

Similarly, position 5 must be a letter not absent.

So let's consider:

Case 1: W at position 2. Then the word is T W E A _, and position 5 is some other letter.

Case 2: W at position 5. Then the word is T _ E A W, and position 2 is some letter that isn't W.

We need valid English words.

For case 1: T W E A _
Position 5 must be a letter not absent. Possible words: ""tweak"" - T W E A K. K is not absent? We haven't tested K.

""tweak"": T-W-E-A-K. Positions: 1:T, 2:W, 3:E, 4:A, 5:K.

This fits, and K is not excluded.

Other possibilities? ""twean"" not a word. ""tweak"" is one.

For case 2: T _ E A W
Position 2: a letter not absent, e.g., ""tread w"" not. ""treaw"" not a word. ""tuba w"" no. ""tweak"" has W at position 2, not 5.

What other words start with T? E at 3, A at 4, and end with W? ""straw"" but S absent and pattern. ""thraw"" not common. Not many words end with W after EA.

So ""tweak"" seems the most plausible.

We also have to consider that W is present, so if we put W at position 2, that's fine.

Now, position 5: in ""tweak"", it is K.

Is K tested? Not from previous feedback, so it could be.

Another word: ""tweed"" but E at position 5? T-W-E-E-D. Position 5 is D, but position 3 is E, position 4 is E? Not, position 4 should be A. ""tweed"" is T-W-E-E-D, so position 4 is E, not A. So invalid.

""tweak"" is the only common word that fits this pattern? ""twas"" not 5 letters.

""tuple"" L absent.

So ""tweak"" seems the word.

But let's confirm if there are alternatives.

Perhaps ""T E A M"" but 4 letters.

No.

Another possibility: T at position 1, W at position 5: word T _ E A W.

Position 2: what letter? For example, ""TIEAW"" not a word. ""TOEAW"" no. Not standard words.

Therefore, ""tweak"" is the most likely word.

Moreover, in the feedback, we can guess ""tweak"".

Since we have one more guess after this if needed, but we have only position 5 unknown effectively? No, position 2 and 5.

We need to make a guess that could solve it or get feedback.

So I'll guess ""tweak"".

But ""tweak"" ends with K, which is not tested.

If not, the feedback will tell us.

In the word, we have W at position 2, which is allowed since W was not at position 1.

And T at position 1 is confirmed? Not yet, but we inferred it must be at position 1.

Feedback from guess 5: T is present but wrong position at position 5, so since only position 1,2,5 open, and T not at 2 or 5, must be at 1.

Yes.

So pattern T _ E A _

With W present, so at position 2 or 5? Position 5 is open, position 2 is open.

If we guess ""tweak"", we use K for position 5.

If wrong, we might have other options like TW being something else.

But let's see.

Another word: ""twaes"" not standard.

I think ""tweak"" is fine.

So guess: tweak

In lowercase.

So output: <guess>tweak</guess>

### Step-by-Step Thought Process

The goal is to deduce the secret word based on cumulative feedback and make the next guess. Here's the analysis:

1. **Pattern from Feedback**:
   - From Guess 4 (""steal""): E is at position 3 (✓), A is at position 4 (✓). Thus, the secret word pattern is `_ _ E A _`.
   - From Guess 5 (""wheat""): 
     - W is present but not at position 1 (-).
     - H is absent (x), adding to the absent list.
     - E and A positions are confirmed (✓).
     - T is present but not at position 5 (-). Combined with Guess 4 (T not at position 2), T must be at position 1 (only remaining position).

2. **Absent Letters**:
  - From Guess 3: C, R, N (absent).
  - From Guess 4: S, L (absent).
  - From Guess 5: H (absent).
  - Total absent: C, R, N, S, L, H. Avoid these.

3. **Present Letters**:
  - E (pos3), A (pos4), T (must be at pos1), W (present, not at pos1; must be at pos2 or pos5).

4. **Word Structure**:
  - Position 1: T (inferred).
  - Position 3: E (fixed).
  - Position 4: A (fixed).
  - Positions 2 and 5: One must be W (since W is present and not at pos1), and the other is an unknown letter not in the absent list.
  - Pattern: `T _ E A _` → with W occupying either position 2 or position 5.

5. **Possible Words**:
  - **W at position 2**: Pattern `T W E A _`. Position 5 requires a letter not absent. Possible words:
    - ""tweak"" (T W E A K): K is untested and valid.
    - Alternatives like ""tweed"" (T W E E D) are invalid (position 4 must be A, not E; D present but E duplicates).
  - **W at position 5**: Pattern `T _ E A W`. Position 2 requires a letter not absent. Few valid options (e.g., ""thraw"" not a word; ""straw"" invalid due to S absent).
  - ""Tweak"" fits best—common, valid 5-letter word, tests W at pos2 and K at pos5.

6. **Next Guess Strategy**:
  - ""Tweak"" maximizes efficiency: 
    - Confirms T at pos1 and W at pos2 (if W is ✓ at pos2, it solves; if -, W moves to pos5).
    - Tests K (common letter), narrowing possibilities if incorrect.
  - If incorrect, feedback on W (position) and K (presence/position) allows solving in the final guess.

<guess>tweak</guess>",tweak,"We are given feedback for Guess 5: ""wheat"" -> Feedback: W(-) H(x) E(✓) A(✓) T(-)

Interpretation:
- W is present but in the wrong position (-). So W is in the secret word but not at position 1.
- H is absent (x). So H is not in the secret word.
- E is correct at position 3 (✓).
- A is correct at position 4 (✓).
- T is present but in the wrong position (-). So T is in the word but not at position 5.

Recall the known information from previous feedback:
- From Guess 4 (""steal""): 
  - E at position 3 is correct (✓).
  - A at position 4 is correct (✓).
  - T is present but not at position 2 (-).
- From Guess 3 (""crane""):
  - C, R, N are absent (x).
- From Guess 4: S and L are absent (x).
- From Guess 5: H is absent (x).

Therefore, absent letters: C, R, N, S, L, H.
Present letters: E (at pos3), A (at pos4), T (somewhere, not at pos2 or pos5), W (somewhere, not at pos1).

The secret word pattern: positions 3 and 4 are fixed as E and A: _ _ E A _

But wait: position 1 is the only one left? Positions 1, 2, 5 are open. But T cannot be at pos2 or pos5, so T must be at position 1.

The available positions for T: pos1, pos2, pos5 (since pos3 and pos4 are fixed). We know T is not at pos2 (from Guess 4) and not at pos5 (from Guess 5), so it must be at position 1.

So T must be at position 1: so the pattern starts with T: T _ E A _

Then for position 2 and 5.

Additionally, W is present but not at position 1 (since not at pos1 from Guess 5). Since position 1 is T, W can be at position 2 or 5.

The word pattern: T _ E A _

With W to be placed at position 2 or 5.

Position 5 is open.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L, H. Avoid these.

Now, we need to fill position 2 and 5 with letters from the available set, including W at one of them? Not necessarily, because W can be at position 2 or 5, and there might be another letter.

But we have W that must be placed in the word, either at position 2 or position 5.

Also, position 2 must be a letter not absent and not T (T is at 1).

Possible letters for position 2: anything not absent and not T, and since W must be somewhere, if it's not at position 2, then it must be at position 5.

Similarly, position 5 must be a letter not absent.

So let's consider:

Case 1: W at position 2. Then the word is T W E A _, and position 5 is some other letter.

Case 2: W at position 5. Then the word is T _ E A W, and position 2 is some letter that isn't W.

We need valid English words.

For case 1: T W E A _
Position 5 must be a letter not absent. Possible words: ""tweak"" - T W E A K. K is not absent? We haven't tested K.

""tweak"": T-W-E-A-K. Positions: 1:T, 2:W, 3:E, 4:A, 5:K.

This fits, and K is not excluded.

Other possibilities? ""twean"" not a word. ""tweak"" is one.

For case 2: T _ E A W
Position 2: a letter not absent, e.g., ""tread w"" not. ""treaw"" not a word. ""tuba w"" no. ""tweak"" has W at position 2, not 5.

What other words start with T? E at 3, A at 4, and end with W? ""straw"" but S absent and pattern. ""thraw"" not common. Not many words end with W after EA.

So ""tweak"" seems the most plausible.

We also have to consider that W is present, so if we put W at position 2, that's fine.

Now, position 5: in ""tweak"", it is K.

Is K tested? Not from previous feedback, so it could be.

Another word: ""tweed"" but E at position 5? T-W-E-E-D. Position 5 is D, but position 3 is E, position 4 is E? Not, position 4 should be A. ""tweed"" is T-W-E-E-D, so position 4 is E, not A. So invalid.

""tweak"" is the only common word that fits this pattern? ""twas"" not 5 letters.

""tuple"" L absent.

So ""tweak"" seems the word.

But let's confirm if there are alternatives.

Perhaps ""T E A M"" but 4 letters.

No.

Another possibility: T at position 1, W at position 5: word T _ E A W.

Position 2: what letter? For example, ""TIEAW"" not a word. ""TOEAW"" no. Not standard words.

Therefore, ""tweak"" is the most likely word.

Yes.

So pattern T _ E A _

With W present, so at position 2 or 5? Position 5 is open, position 2 is open.

If we guess ""tweak"", we use K for position 5.

If wrong, we might have other options like TW being something else.
