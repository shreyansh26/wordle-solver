We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C -> (-) meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
 R -> (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 A -> (-) meaning A is in the word but in the wrong position.
 N -> (x) meaning N is not in the word.
 E -> (x) meaning E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters C, R, and A, but none of them are in the positions they were in ""crane"".
 - The secret word does not contain N or E.

 Since the word is 5 letters, and we have three confirmed letters (C, R, A) that must appear, but in different positions.

 Let's recall the positions in ""crane"":
  1: C
  2: R
  3: A
  4: N (absent)
  5: E (absent)

 Therefore, the secret word has:
 - C not in position 1
 - R not in position 2
 - A not in position 3

 Also, we must avoid using N and E in any position.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to place C, R, and A in different positions and also try to find two more letters that might be in the word.

 Since we have three letters to place, we can try a word that rearranges C, R, A and uses two new letters (that are not N or E) to test.

 We also want to cover common letters to maximize information.

 Let me think of words that have C, R, A but in different positions and without N or E.

 Possible positions for C: it cannot be at position 1. So it can be at 2,3,4,5? But note: we have to avoid the positions where we know the letters are not.

 However, we don't know the positions of R and A either. So we can try:

 Option: put C in position 2? But in the first word, position 2 was R and now we know R is not in position 2. But that doesn't prevent C from being in position 2.

 But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters (N and E) and also we know that the word must have C, R, A.

 Let me try to form a word:

 We can try to put:
  C in position 2? But then we have to avoid position 1 for C? Actually, we can put C in any position except 1.

 However, we also have R and A to place. R cannot be in position 2 (because that was its position in the first guess and it was marked wrong) and A cannot be in position 3.

 So let's try:

 Position 1: cannot be C (because C is misplaced from position 1) and we don't know about other letters. We can try a new letter for position 1.

 We can try a word that has:
   Position 1: a new letter (not C, R, A, and not N, E) and then place C, R, A in positions 2,3,4,5 but avoiding the forbidden positions.

 But note: R cannot be in position 2 and A cannot be in position 3.

 So for R: positions 1,3,4,5? But position 1 we are considering a new letter? Actually, we can put R in position 1? But wait, we don't have any feedback that R cannot be in position 1. The feedback only said that R is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A can be in position 1,2,4,5? (but not 3).

 However, we also have to place C: it can be in 2,3,4,5? (but not 1).

 But note: we have three letters to place and two more positions to fill with new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the same letters but rearranged? But we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong.

 However, we have two new letters to introduce.

 Let me think of common words that contain C, R, A and two other letters (without N and E).

 We can try to use a word that has C, R, A and two new consonants or vowels? We haven't tested many vowels: we know E is absent, but we haven't tested I, O, U.

 Since we have A (which is a vowel) and we know E is absent, we might want to test other vowels? But we have to include C, R, A.

 Let me try to form a word:

 Option: ""TRACE"" -> but we know E is absent, so that's invalid.

 Option: ""CRACK"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use C in position 1. Also, we have two C's? The feedback for ""crane"" had only one C? Actually, the feedback only told us about the C in position 1. It's possible the word has two C's? But we don't know. However, in ""crack"", the first C is in position 1 which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.

 Option: ""CARTs"" -> but we need 5 letters. ""CARTS"" has C in position 1? Forbidden.

 We must avoid C in position 1.

 Let me try ""SCRAP"" -> but S is a new letter, C is in position 2 (which is allowed), R in position 3? But wait, in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was wrong, but we don't know about position 3 for R? Actually, the feedback for R was only that it is in the word but not in position 2. So position 3 is allowed for R? However, we also have A: in ""SCRAP"", A is in position 4? That's allowed because the feedback only said A is not in position 3.

 But note: we have to avoid E and N, and ""SCRAP"" has S, C, R, A, P. None of E or N. So that's acceptable.

 However, let's check the positions:
  S at 1 (new)
  C at 2 (we know C is in the word, but not at position 1 -> so position 2 is new and allowed)
  R at 3 (we know R is in the word, and it was not at 2, but we don't know about 3 -> so allowed)
  A at 4 (we know A is in the word, and it was not at 3 -> position 4 is allowed)
  P at 5 (new)

 This seems like a good candidate.

 But wait: what if the secret word has two of the same letter? We don't know. But ""SCRAP"" uses each of C, R, A once and introduces S and P.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRAMP"" -> but C is at position 1? Forbidden.

 Another option: ""TRACK"" -> T at 1, R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 (because in the first guess R was at 2 and was marked wrong). So we cannot put R at 2.

 How about ""TRACk"" -> but E is absent and we have to avoid E? Actually, ""TRACK"" has no E, but R is at position 2? That's forbidden.

 Another option: ""CRAWL"" -> C at 1? Forbidden.

 How about ""ARCED"" -> but E is absent? So we cannot use E.

 Another idea: ""CARDS"" -> C at 1? Forbidden.

 So ""SCRAP"" seems a good choice.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROACH"" -> but R is at position 1? That's allowed (since R was only forbidden at position 2). O is a new vowel, A at position 3? But wait, in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was marked wrong? So we cannot put A at position 3. In ""ROACH"", A is at position 3? That's forbidden.

 So ""ROACH"" is invalid because of A at position 3.

 Another candidate: ""CRWTH"" -> not a common word and it has W and H which are less common.

 Let me stick with ""SCRAP"".

 But wait, in ""SCRAP"", we have:
   S at 1: new
   C at 2: we know C is in the word, but we are putting it at 2. This is a test to see if it's in the correct position.
   R at 3: we know R is in the word, and we are putting it at 3 (which is not 2, so allowed) but we don't know if 3 is correct.
   A at 4: we know A is in the word, and we are putting it at 4 (which is not 3, so allowed) but we don't know if 4 is correct.
   P at 5: new.

 This guess will give us information about the positions of C, R, A and also whether S and P are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses the letters in completely different positions? But we have constraints.

 Another common word: ""PARTY"" -> but we don't have C? We must include C because we know C is in the word. So we cannot omit C.

 We must include all three: C, R, A.

 So I think ""SCRAP"" is a good choice.

 But let me check if there's a word that uses C, R, A and two new letters and avoids the forbidden positions without putting C at 1, R at 2, A at 3.

 Another option: ""CRISP"" -> C at 1? Forbidden.

 ""CRASS"" -> C at 1? Forbidden.

 ""CROAK"" -> C at 1? Forbidden.

 ""RACED"" -> has E? Forbidden.

 ""RACKS"" -> R at 1 (allowed), A at 2 (we don't have feedback on A at 2? But we know A is not at 3, so 2 is allowed), C at 3 (allowed because we know C is not at 1, but 3 is new), K at 4, S at 5.

 But note: in ""RACKS"", we have:
   R at 1: we know R is in the word, and we haven't tested position 1 for R -> so allowed.
   A at 2: we know A is in the word, and we haven't tested position 2 for A -> allowed (only forbidden at 3).
   C at 3: we know C is in the word, and we haven't tested position 3 for C -> allowed (only forbidden at 1).
   K and S are new.

 This is also a good candidate.

 Now, between ""SCRAP"" and ""RACKS"", which one is better?

 In ""SCRAP"", we are testing S at the beginning and P at the end. In ""RACKS"", we are testing K and S.

 Both are valid. But note that in ""RACKS"", we are putting R at position 1 and A at position 2. We don't have any feedback that R cannot be at 1 or A at 2? Actually, we only know that R is not at 2 and A is not at 3. So both positions 1 and 2 are open for them.

 However, we might get more information if we spread the known letters to different positions? In ""SCRAP"", we have known letters at 2,3,4 and in ""RACKS"" at 1,2,3.

 Since we have three known letters, we want to test as many new positions as possible.

 In ""SCRAP"", we are testing C at 2 (which is a new position for C) and R at 3 (new for R) and A at 4 (new for A). In ""RACKS"", we are testing R at 1 (new), A at 2 (new), and C at 3 (new). So both are testing three new positions.

 But in ""SCRAP"", we are also introducing S and P, and in ""RACKS"", we are introducing K and S. Since S is common, it might be a good idea to test it.

 However, I think both are reasonable. Let me choose ""SCRAP"" because it avoids putting two known letters (R and A) in the first two positions, which might be more likely to be consonants? Not necessarily.

 Alternatively, we can consider the frequency of letters. S is a very common letter, so testing it is good. P is less common than S? But in ""RACKS"", we test S at the end and K (which is also common).

 But note: we have already eliminated E and N. The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. We have A, R, C already. We are missing S, O, I, T, L, etc.

 So testing S is a good idea.

 I'll go with ""SCRAP"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""SCRAP"" itself? Then we would win. But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't reuse the same letters in a way that might be confusing? But I think it's fine.

 Let me confirm: the secret word must have C, R, A. And we are using them in positions 2,3,4. And we are introducing S and P.

 So I choose ""SCRAP"".

<guess>scrap</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively.
- N and E are not in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Must include C, R, and A in positions other than the forbidden ones (C not at 1, R not at 2, A not at 3).
- Avoid using N or E.
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""scrap"" fits these criteria:
- S (new) at position 1.
- C at position 2 (allowed, since C cannot be at 1).
- R at position 3 (allowed, since R cannot be at 2).
- A at position 4 (allowed, since A cannot be at 3).
- P (new) at position 5.

This guess tests new positions for C, R, and A while introducing S and P, which are common letters.

<guess>scrap</guess>",scrap,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C -> (-) meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
 R -> (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 A -> (-) meaning A is in the word but in the wrong position.
 N -> (x) meaning N is not in the word.
 E -> (x) meaning E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters C, R, and A, but none of them are in the positions they were in ""crane"".
 - The secret word does not contain N or E.

 Since the word is 5 letters, and we have three confirmed letters (C, R, A) that must appear, but in different positions.

 Let's recall the positions in ""crane"":
  1: C
  2: R
  3: A
  4: N (absent)
  5: E (absent)

 Therefore, the secret word has:
 - C not in position 1
 - R not in position 2
 - A not in position 3

 Also, we must avoid using N and E in any position.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to place C, R, and A in different positions and also try to find two more letters that might be in the word.

 Since we have three letters to place, we can try a word that rearranges C, R, A and uses two new letters (that are not N or E) to test.

 We also want to cover common letters to maximize information.

 Let me think of words that have C, R, A but in different positions and without N or E.

 Possible positions for C: it cannot be at position 1. So it can be at 2,3,4,5? But note: we have to avoid the positions where we know the letters are not.

 However, we don't know the positions of R and A either. So we can try:

 Option: put C in position 2? But in the first word, position 2 was R and now we know R is not in position 2. But that doesn't prevent C from being in position 2.

 But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters (N and E) and also we know that the word must have C, R, A.

 Let me try to form a word:

 We can try to put:
  C in position 2? But then we have to avoid position 1 for C? Actually, we can put C in any position except 1.

 However, we also have R and A to place. R cannot be in position 2 (because that was its position in the first guess and it was marked wrong) and A cannot be in position 3.

 So let's try:

 Position 1: cannot be C (because C is misplaced from position 1) and we don't know about other letters. We can try a new letter for position 1.

 We can try a word that has:
   Position 1: a new letter (not C, R, A, and not N, E) and then place C, R, A in positions 2,3,4,5 but avoiding the forbidden positions.

 But note: R cannot be in position 2 and A cannot be in position 3.

 So for R: positions 1,3,4,5? But position 1 we are considering a new letter? Actually, we can put R in position 1? But wait, we don't have any feedback that R cannot be in position 1. The feedback only said that R is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A can be in position 1,2,4,5? (but not 3).

 However, we also have to place C: it can be in 2,3,4,5? (but not 1).

 But note: we have three letters to place and two more positions to fill with new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the same letters but rearranged? But we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong.

 However, we have two new letters to introduce.

 Let me think of common words that contain C, R, A and two other letters (without N and E).

 We can try to use a word that has C, R, A and two new consonants or vowels? We haven't tested many vowels: we know E is absent, but we haven't tested I, O, U.

 Since we have A (which is a vowel) and we know E is absent, we might want to test other vowels? But we have to include C, R, A.

 Let me try to form a word:

 Option: ""TRACE"" -> but we know E is absent, so that's invalid.

 Option: ""CRACK"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use C in position 1. Also, we have two C's? The feedback for ""crane"" had only one C? Actually, the feedback only told us about the C in position 1. It's possible the word has two C's? But we don't know. However, in ""crack"", the first C is in position 1 which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.

 Option: ""CARTs"" -> but we need 5 letters. ""CARTS"" has C in position 1? Forbidden.

 We must avoid C in position 1.

 Let me try ""SCRAP"" -> but S is a new letter, C is in position 2 (which is allowed), R in position 3? But wait, in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was wrong, but we don't know about position 3 for R? Actually, the feedback for R was only that it is in the word but not in position 2. So position 3 is allowed for R? However, we also have A: in ""SCRAP"", A is in position 4? That's allowed because the feedback only said A is not in position 3.

 But note: we have to avoid E and N, and ""SCRAP"" has S, C, R, A, P. None of E or N. So that's acceptable.

 However, let's check the positions:
  S at 1 (new)
  C at 2 (we know C is in the word, but not at position 1 -> so position 2 is new and allowed)
  R at 3 (we know R is in the word, and it was not at 2, but we don't know about 3 -> so allowed)
  A at 4 (we know A is in the word, and it was not at 3 -> position 4 is allowed)
  P at 5 (new)

 This seems like a good candidate.

 But wait: what if the secret word has two of the same letter? We don't know. But ""SCRAP"" uses each of C, R, A once and introduces S and P.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRAMP"" -> but C is at position 1? Forbidden.

 Another option: ""TRACK"" -> T at 1, R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 (because in the first guess R was at 2 and was marked wrong). So we cannot put R at 2.

 How about ""TRACk"" -> but E is absent and we have to avoid E? Actually, ""TRACK"" has no E, but R is at position 2? That's forbidden.

 Another option: ""CRAWL"" -> C at 1? Forbidden.

 How about ""ARCED"" -> but E is absent? So we cannot use E.

 Another idea: ""CARDS"" -> C at 1? Forbidden.

 So ""SCRAP"" seems a good choice.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROACH"" -> but R is at position 1? That's allowed (since R was only forbidden at position 2). O is a new vowel, A at position 3? But wait, in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was marked wrong? So we cannot put A at position 3. In ""ROACH"", A is at position 3? That's forbidden.

 So ""ROACH"" is invalid because of A at position 3.

 Another candidate: ""CRWTH"" -> not a common word and it has W and H which are less common.

 Let me stick with ""SCRAP"".

 But wait, in ""SCRAP"", we have:
   S at 1: new
   C at 2: we know C is in the word, but we are putting it at 2. This is a test to see if it's in the correct position.
   R at 3: we know R is in the word, and we are putting it at 3 (which is not 2, so allowed) but we don't know if 3 is correct.
   A at 4: we know A is in the word, and we are putting it at 4 (which is not 3, so allowed) but we don't know if 4 is correct.
   P at 5: new.

 This guess will give us information about the positions of C, R, A and also whether S and P are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses the letters in completely different positions? But we have constraints.

 Another common word: ""PARTY"" -> but we don't have C? We must include C because we know C is in the word. So we cannot omit C.

 We must include all three: C, R, A.

 So I think ""SCRAP"" is a good choice.

 But let me check if there's a word that uses C, R, A and two new letters and avoids the forbidden positions without putting C at 1, R at 2, A at 3.

 Another option: ""CRISP"" -> C at 1? Forbidden.

 ""CRASS"" -> C at 1? Forbidden.

 ""CROAK"" -> C at 1? Forbidden.

 ""RACED"" -> has E? Forbidden.

 ""RACKS"" -> R at 1 (allowed), A at 2 (we don't have feedback on A at 2? But we know A is not at 3, so 2 is allowed), C at 3 (allowed because we know C is not at 1, but 3 is new), K at 4, S at 5.

 But note: in ""RACKS"", we have:
   R at 1: we know R is in the word, and we haven't tested position 1 for R -> so allowed.
   A at 2: we know A is in the word, and we haven't tested position 2 for A -> allowed (only forbidden at 3).
   C at 3: we know C is in the word, and we haven't tested position 3 for C -> allowed (only forbidden at 1).
   K and S are new.

 This is also a good candidate.

 Now, between ""SCRAP"" and ""RACKS"", which one is better?

 In ""SCRAP"", we are testing S at the beginning and P at the end. In ""RACKS"", we are testing K and S.

 Both are valid. But note that in ""RACKS"", we are putting R at position 1 and A at position 2. We don't have any feedback that R cannot be at 1 or A at 2? Actually, we only know that R is not at 2 and A is not at 3. So both positions 1 and 2 are open for them.

 However, we might get more information if we spread the known letters to different positions? In ""SCRAP"", we have known letters at 2,3,4 and in ""RACKS"" at 1,2,3.

 Since we have three known letters, we want to test as many new positions as possible.

 In ""SCRAP"", we are testing C at 2 (which is a new position for C) and R at 3 (new for R) and A at 4 (new for A). In ""RACKS"", we are testing R at 1 (new), A at 2 (new), and C at 3 (new). So both are testing three new positions.

 But in ""SCRAP"", we are also introducing S and P, and in ""RACKS"", we are introducing K and S. Since S is common, it might be a good idea to test it.

 However, I think both are reasonable. Let me choose ""SCRAP"" because it avoids putting two known letters (R and A) in the first two positions, which might be more likely to be consonants? Not necessarily.

 Alternatively, we can consider the frequency of letters. S is a very common letter, so testing it is good. P is less common than S? But in ""RACKS"", we test S at the end and K (which is also common).

 But note: we have already eliminated E and N. The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. We have A, R, C already. We are missing S, O, I, T, L, etc.

 So testing S is a good idea.

 I'll go with ""SCRAP"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""SCRAP"" itself? Then we would win. But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't reuse the same letters in a way that might be confusing? But I think it's fine.

 Let me confirm: the secret word must have C, R, A. And we are using them in positions 2,3,4. And we are introducing S and P.

 So I choose ""SCRAP"".

<guess>scrap</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively.
- N and E are not in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Must include C, R, and A in positions other than the forbidden ones (C not at 1, R not at 2, A not at 3).
- Avoid using N or E.
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""scrap"" fits these criteria:
- S (new) at position 1.
- C at position 2 (allowed, since C cannot be at 1).
- R at position 3 (allowed, since R cannot be at 2).
- A at position 4 (allowed, since A cannot be at 3).
- P (new) at position 5.

This guess tests new positions for C, R, and A while introducing S and P, which are common letters.",Guess 2: scrap -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(✓) R(-) A(-) P(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C -> (-) meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
 R -> (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 A -> (-) meaning A is in the word but in the wrong position.
 N -> (x) meaning N is not in the word.
 E -> (x) meaning E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters C, R, and A, but none of them are in the positions they were in ""crane"".
 - The secret word does not contain N or E.

 Since the word is 5 letters, and we have three confirmed letters (C, R, A) that must appear, but in different positions.

 Let's recall the positions in ""crane"":
  1: C
  2: R
  3: A
  4: N (absent)
  5: E (absent)

 Therefore, the secret word has:
 - C not in position 1
 - R not in position 2
 - A not in position 3

 Also, we must avoid using N and E in any position.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to place C, R, and A in different positions and also try to find two more letters that might be in the word.

 Since we have three letters to place, we can try a word that rearranges C, R, A and uses two new letters (that are not N or E) to test.

 We also want to cover common letters to maximize information.

 Let me think of words that have C, R, A but in different positions and without N or E.

 Possible positions for C: it cannot be at position 1. So it can be at 2,3,4,5? But note: we have to avoid the positions where we know the letters are not.

 However, we don't know the positions of R and A either. So we can try:

 Option: put C in position 2? But in the first word, position 2 was R and now we know R is not in position 2. But that doesn't prevent C from being in position 2.

 But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters (N and E) and also we know that the word must have C, R, A.

 Let me try to form a word:

 We can try to put:
  C in position 2? But then we have to avoid position 1 for C? Actually, we can put C in any position except 1.

 However, we also have R and A to place. R cannot be in position 2 (because that was its position in the first guess and it was marked wrong) and A cannot be in position 3.

 So let's try:

 Position 1: cannot be C (because C is misplaced from position 1) and we don't know about other letters. We can try a new letter for position 1.

 We can try a word that has:
   Position 1: a new letter (not C, R, A, and not N, E) and then place C, R, A in positions 2,3,4,5 but avoiding the forbidden positions.

 But note: R cannot be in position 2 and A cannot be in position 3.

 So for R: positions 1,3,4,5? But position 1 we are considering a new letter? Actually, we can put R in position 1? But wait, we don't have any feedback that R cannot be in position 1. The feedback only said that R is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A can be in position 1,2,4,5? (but not 3).

 However, we also have to place C: it can be in 2,3,4,5? (but not 1).

 But note: we have three letters to place and two more positions to fill with new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the same letters but rearranged? But we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong.

 However, we have two new letters to introduce.

 Let me think of common words that contain C, R, A and two other letters (without N and E).

 We can try to use a word that has C, R, A and two new consonants or vowels? We haven't tested many vowels: we know E is absent, but we haven't tested I, O, U.

 Since we have A (which is a vowel) and we know E is absent, we might want to test other vowels? But we have to include C, R, A.

 Let me try to form a word:

 Option: ""TRACE"" -> but we know E is absent, so that's invalid.

 Option: ""CRACK"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot use C in position 1. Also, we have two C's? The feedback for ""crane"" had only one C? Actually, the feedback only told us about the C in position 1. It's possible the word has two C's? But we don't know. However, in ""crack"", the first C is in position 1 which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.

 Option: ""CARTs"" -> but we need 5 letters. ""CARTS"" has C in position 1? Forbidden.

 We must avoid C in position 1.

 Let me try ""SCRAP"" -> but S is a new letter, C is in position 2 (which is allowed), R in position 3? But wait, in the first guess, R was in position 2 and was wrong, but we don't know about position 3 for R? Actually, the feedback for R was only that it is in the word but not in position 2. So position 3 is allowed for R? However, we also have A: in ""SCRAP"", A is in position 4? That's allowed because the feedback only said A is not in position 3.

 But note: we have to avoid E and N, and ""SCRAP"" has S, C, R, A, P. None of E or N. So that's acceptable.

 However, let's check the positions:
  S at 1 (new)
  C at 2 (we know C is in the word, but not at position 1 -> so position 2 is new and allowed)
  R at 3 (we know R is in the word, and it was not at 2, but we don't know about 3 -> so allowed)
  A at 4 (we know A is in the word, and it was not at 3 -> position 4 is allowed)
  P at 5 (new)

 This seems like a good candidate.

 But wait: what if the secret word has two of the same letter? We don't know. But ""SCRAP"" uses each of C, R, A once and introduces S and P.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRAMP"" -> but C is at position 1? Forbidden.

 Another option: ""TRACK"" -> T at 1, R at 2? But R cannot be at position 2 (because in the first guess R was at 2 and was marked wrong). So we cannot put R at 2.

 How about ""TRACk"" -> but E is absent and we have to avoid E? Actually, ""TRACK"" has no E, but R is at position 2? That's forbidden.

 Another option: ""CRAWL"" -> C at 1? Forbidden.

 How about ""ARCED"" -> but E is absent? So we cannot use E.

 Another idea: ""CARDS"" -> C at 1? Forbidden.

 So ""SCRAP"" seems a good choice.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROACH"" -> but R is at position 1? That's allowed (since R was only forbidden at position 2). O is a new vowel, A at position 3? But wait, in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was marked wrong? So we cannot put A at position 3. In ""ROACH"", A is at position 3? That's forbidden.

 So ""ROACH"" is invalid because of A at position 3.

 Another candidate: ""CRWTH"" -> not a common word and it has W and H which are less common.

 Let me stick with ""SCRAP"".

 But wait, in ""SCRAP"", we have:
   S at 1: new
   C at 2: we know C is in the word, but we are putting it at 2. This is a test to see if it's in the correct position.
   R at 3: we know R is in the word, and we are putting it at 3 (which is not 2, so allowed) but we don't know if 3 is correct.
   A at 4: we know A is in the word, and we are putting it at 4 (which is not 3, so allowed) but we don't know if 4 is correct.
   P at 5: new.

 This guess will give us information about the positions of C, R, A and also whether S and P are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses the letters in completely different positions? But we have constraints.

 Another common word: ""PARTY"" -> but we don't have C? We must include C because we know C is in the word. So we cannot omit C.

 We must include all three: C, R, A.

 So I think ""SCRAP"" is a good choice.

 But let me check if there's a word that uses C, R, A and two new letters and avoids the forbidden positions without putting C at 1, R at 2, A at 3.

 Another option: ""CRISP"" -> C at 1? Forbidden.

 ""CRASS"" -> C at 1? Forbidden.

 ""CROAK"" -> C at 1? Forbidden.

 ""RACED"" -> has E? Forbidden.

 ""RACKS"" -> R at 1 (allowed), A at 2 (we don't have feedback on A at 2? But we know A is not at 3, so 2 is allowed), C at 3 (allowed because we know C is not at 1, but 3 is new), K at 4, S at 5.

 But note: in ""RACKS"", we have:
   R at 1: we know R is in the word, and we haven't tested position 1 for R -> so allowed.
   A at 2: we know A is in the word, and we haven't tested position 2 for A -> allowed (only forbidden at 3).
   C at 3: we know C is in the word, and we haven't tested position 3 for C -> allowed (only forbidden at 1).
   K and S are new.

 This is also a good candidate.

 Now, between ""SCRAP"" and ""RACKS"", which one is better?

 In ""SCRAP"", we are testing S at the beginning and P at the end. In ""RACKS"", we are testing K and S.

 Both are valid. But note that in ""RACKS"", we are putting R at position 1 and A at position 2. We don't have any feedback that R cannot be at 1 or A at 2? Actually, we only know that R is not at 2 and A is not at 3. So both positions 1 and 2 are open for them.

 However, we might get more information if we spread the known letters to different positions? In ""SCRAP"", we have known letters at 2,3,4 and in ""RACKS"" at 1,2,3.

 In ""SCRAP"", we are testing C at 2 (which is a new position for C) and R at 3 (new for R) and A at 4 (new for A). In ""RACKS"", we are testing R at 1 (new), A at 2 (new), and C at 3 (new). So both are testing three new positions.

 But in ""SCRAP"", we are also introducing S and P, and in ""RACKS"", we are introducing K and S. Since S is common, it might be a good idea to test it.

But we know A is not at 3, so 2 is allowed), C at 3 (allowed because we know C is not at 1, but 3 is new), K at 4, S at 5.\n\n But note: in ""RACKS"", we have:\n   R at 1: we know R is in the word, and we haven\'t tested position 1 for R -> so allowed.\n   A at 2: we know A is in the word, and we haven\'t tested position 2 for A -> allowed (only forbidden at 3).\n   C at 3: we know C is in the word, and we haven\'t tested position 3 for C -> allowed (only forbidden at 1).\n   K and S are new.\n\n This is also a good candidate.\n\n Now, between ""SCRAP"" and ""RACKS"", which one is better?\n\n In ""SCRAP"", we are testing S at the beginning and P at the end. In ""RACKS"", we are testing K and S.\n\n Both are valid. But note that in ""RACKS"", we are putting R at position 1 and A at position 2. We don\'t have any feedback that R cannot be at 1 or A at 2? Actually, we only know that R is not at 2 and A is not at 3. So both positions 1 and 2 are open for them.\n\n However, we might get more information if we spread the known letters to different positions? In ""SCRAP"", we have known letters at 2,3,4 and in ""RACKS"" at 1,2,3.\n\n Since we have three known letters, we want to test as many new positions as possible.\n\n In ""SCRAP"", we are testing C at 2 (which is a new position for C) and R at 3 (new for R) and A at 4 (new for A). In ""RACKS"", we are testing R at 1 (new), A at 2 (new), and C at 3 (new). So both are testing three new positions.\n\n But in ""SCRAP"", we are also introducing S and P, and in ""RACKS"", we are introducing K and S. Since S is common, it might be a good idea to test it.\n\n However, I think both are reasonable. Let me choose ""SCRAP"" because it avoids putting two known letters (R and A) in the first two positions, which might be more likely to be consonants? Not necessarily.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the frequency of letters. S is a very common letter, so testing it is good. P is less common than S? But in ""RACKS"", we test S at the end and K (which is also common).\n\n But note: we have already eliminated E and N. The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. We have A, R, C already. We are missing S, O, I, T, L, etc.\n\n So testing S is a good idea.\n\n I\'ll go with ""SCRAP"".\n\n But wait: what if the word is ""SCRAP"" itself? Then we would win. But we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t reuse the same letters in a way that might be confusing? But I think it\'s fine.\n\n Let me confirm: the secret word must have C, R, A. And we are using them in positions 2,3,4. And we are introducing S and P.\n\n So I choose ""SCRAP"".\n\n<guess>scrap</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively.\n- N and E are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include C, R, and A in positions other than the forbidden ones (C not at 1, R not at 2, A not at 3).\n- Avoid using N or E.\n- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""scrap"" fits these criteria:\n- S (new) at position 1.\n- C at position 2 (allowed, since C cannot be at 1).\n- R at position 3 (allowed, since R cannot be at 2).\n- A at position 4 (allowed, since A cannot be at 3).\n- P (new) at position 5.\n\nThis guess tests new positions for C, R, and A while introducing S and P, which are common letters.\n\n<guess>scrap</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: scrap -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(✓) R(-) A(-) P(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: - (in word, wrong position)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  A: - (in word, wrong position)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""scrap""
  S: x (not in word)
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  A: - (in word, wrong position)
  P: x (not in word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word contains the letters C, R, A (from first guess) and we now know that C is in the correct position at position 2 (from second guess).
2. The secret word does not contain: N, E, S, P.
3. The letter C is fixed at position 2. So the word is: _ C _ _ _
4. The letter R is in the word but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess, because we put R at 3 and it was marked as wrong position). So R must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5.
5. The letter A is in the word but not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 4 (from second guess, because we put A at 4 and it was marked as wrong position). So A must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, or 5. But note: position 2 is already taken by C, so A cannot be at 2. Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 5.

Now, let's list the constraints:

- Position 1: can be R or A (since C is fixed at 2, and we know it's not S, N, E, P). Also, it cannot be any of the absent letters we know (N, E, S, P). But note: we don't know if there are other absent letters. We have to avoid using any of the absent letters (N, E, S, P).
- Position 3: must be a letter that we haven't tried yet? We know that the word has 5 letters and we have C at 2. We know that R and A are not in position 3 (from first guess) and also from the second guess we don't have direct constraint on position 3 except that we put R there and it was wrong, but that doesn't say anything about the letter at position 3. Actually, the feedback for position 3 in the second guess was for R, which we now know is not at 3. But the letter at position 3 in the secret word is still unknown.

We also know that the word must contain R and A, and one more letter (since we have 5 positions and we have C, R, A, and two more? Actually, we have three known letters: C, R, A, and two unknown letters.

But note: we have two positions that must be filled: positions 1, 3, 4, 5? Actually, position 2 is fixed as C. So we have positions 1, 3, 4, 5 to fill with R, A, and two new letters? But wait: we have two known letters (R and A) that must be placed in two of these four positions, and the remaining two positions must be filled with two new letters (that are not N, E, S, P).

However, we have constraints on where R and A can go:

- R can be at 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2 or 3).
- A can be at 1 or 5 (since 2 is taken by C and 3 and 4 are forbidden for A? Wait: from the first guess, A was at 3 and was wrong. From the second guess, A was at 4 and was wrong. So A cannot be at 3 or 4. Therefore, A must be at 1 or 5.

Now, note that if A is at 1, then position 1 is A, and then R must be at 4 or 5. Similarly, if A is at 5, then R can be at 1, 4, or 5? But if A is at 5, then R cannot be at 5 (unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don't know). We haven't seen any duplicate letters so far, so we assume no duplicates until we have evidence.

So let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: A at position 1.
  Then the word is: A C _ _ _
  R must be at 4 or 5.
  The remaining positions (3 and either 4 or 5) must be filled with two new letters (not N, E, S, P).

Case 2: A at position 5.
  Then the word is: _ C _ _ A
  R must be at 1 or 4 (since 5 is taken by A, and we assume no duplicates).
  Then the remaining positions (3 and either 1 or 4) must be filled with new letters.

But note: in case 2, if R is at 1, then the word is: R C _ _ A, and then positions 3 and 4 are new letters. If R is at 4, then the word is: _ C _ R A, and then positions 1 and 3 are new letters.

We need to choose a word that will help us distinguish these cases and also test new letters.

We also want to cover common letters. We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we should focus on common ones.

We can try to form a word that fits one of these patterns and uses common letters.

Alternatively, we can try to test the position of A and R by choosing a word that has A at 1 or 5 and R at 4 or 5, but also introduces two new common letters.

But note: we must avoid the absent letters: N, E, S, P.

Let me try to think of words that fit the pattern and have common letters.

First, if we assume A is at 1, then we have: A C _ _ _
We need to put R at 4 or 5, and two new letters.

Option: A C _ R _ -> but then the last letter must be filled. For example, ""ACRID"" -> but we haven't tested I and D. But note: we must avoid E, N, S, P. I and D are allowed.

But we don't know if A is at 1. We want to test both possibilities.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at 5 to test that case.

But we need to maximize information. We can choose a word that has R in one of the allowed positions and A in one of the allowed positions, and then two new letters.

Let me list possible words:

- If we put A at 5 and R at 1: then the word would be R C _ _ A. What words are there? Like ""RCLIA"" (not a word), ""RADIO"" (but D and I, and O) -> but note: we have to avoid E, N, S, P. ""RADIO"" is a word? Yes. But let's check: R at 1, A at 5? No, in ""RADIO"", A is at 2? We need A at 5. So that doesn't fit.

How about ""RECUT"" -> but E is forbidden.

How about ""ROCKY"" -> but O, C, K, Y. But we have C at 2? So ""R C _ _ A"" pattern: we need the last letter to be A. So the word must end with A. 

Words ending with A: and having R at 1 and C at 2? Like ""RCA"" something? But we need 5 letters. ""RCA"" is three. 

""R C _ _ A"": so the third and fourth letters are unknown. 

Possible words: 
  ""RACHA"" -> not a word.
  ""RICHA"" -> not a word.
  ""ROCHA"" -> not a word.

How about ""RUBA_"" -> ""RUBY"" is 4 letters. 

Actually, common words: ""RECLAIM"" is too long.

I think it's hard to find a word with R at 1 and A at 5 and C at 2. 

Alternatively, if we put R at 4 and A at 5: then the word is: _ C _ R A.

What words fit this? For example: 
  ""OCRA"" is 4 letters. 
  ""ACRID"" has A at 1, not at 5.

We need the pattern: ? C ? R A.

Examples: 
  ""SCRA_"" -> but S is absent, so no.
  ""ECRUSA"" -> too long and has E.

Common words: 
  ""Cobra"" -> but C is at 1? We need C at 2. So the word must have the second letter C.

Words with second letter C and ending with ""RA"": 
  Let me think: ""OCRA"" is 4 letters. 
  ""ICRA"" is 4 letters.

5-letter words: 
  ""MACRO"" -> but ends with O, not A.
  ""MICRA"" -> that's a word? It is the plural of micron. But it has M at 1, I at 2? No, we need C at 2. So ""MICRA"" has M at 1, I at 2, C at 3? Not at 2.

We need the second letter to be C. So the pattern: ? C ? R A.

Examples: 
  ""ACURA"" -> but A at 1, then C at 2, U at 3, R at 4, A at 5. This fits: A C U R A. But note: it has two A's? That's possible. And we haven't ruled out duplicates.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The feedback doesn't show duplicates? Actually, in Wordle, duplicates are allowed and the feedback would indicate if a duplicate is present by marking each occurrence. But in our first two guesses, we didn't have duplicates, so we don't know.

But ""ACURA"" is a proper noun? It might not be in the word list.

Another word: ""FICUS"" -> but S is absent and doesn't end with A.

How about ""LUCRA"" -> not a common word.

Another idea: ""VOCAL"" -> but ends with L, not A.

This is difficult. Maybe we should avoid putting A at 5 for now and test the other case.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't include A at 1 or 5, but we know A must be at 1 or 5. So we have to put it in one of these positions.

But we can choose a word that has A at 1 to test that case.

So let's try the pattern: A C _ _ _

We need to put R at 4 or 5, and two new letters.

For example, ""A C _ R _"": then the last letter is unknown. Or ""A C _ _ R"".

Common words:

- ""ACRID"": A at 1, C at 2, R at 3? But wait, we know that R cannot be at position 3? From the second guess, we put R at 3 and it was marked as wrong position. So R cannot be at 3. Therefore, in ""ACRID"", R is at 3, which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.

- ""ACTOR"": A at 1, C at 2, T at 3, O at 4, R at 5. This fits: 
  - A at 1: allowed (since A can be at 1)
  - C at 2: fixed
  - T at 3: new letter
  - O at 4: new letter
  - R at 5: allowed (R can be at 5)

Also, avoids N, E, S, P.

So ""ACTOR"" is a valid guess.

Another option: ""ACORN"" -> but N is absent, so no.

""ACHOO"" -> not 5 letters? ""ACHOO"" is 5 letters? A-C-H-O-O. But it has two O's. And we don't know if O is in the word. But N is absent, but we are not using N. However, we have to avoid N, E, S, P. O is allowed. But ""ACHOO"" is an onomatopoeia, might be in the word list? But let's see: we need R in the word. ""ACHOO"" does not have R. But we know R must be in the word. So we cannot use ""ACHOO"".

Another word: ""ACRID"" we already saw R at 3 is forbidden.

""ACOLD"" -> not common, and R is missing.

So ""ACTOR"" seems a good candidate.

But what if the word has A at 5? Then ""ACTOR"" would have A at 1, which might be wrong. But that's okay because we are testing the hypothesis.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at 5 and R at 1? But we couldn't find a common word. Or R at 4.

Let me try to find a word with A at 5 and R at 4: pattern _ C _ R A.

Words: 
  ""OCREA"" -> not common.
  ""ICRA"" is 4 letters.
  ""ZEBRA"" -> but E is absent and Z at 1, E at 2? We need C at 2.

How about ""CIRCA"" -> but C is at 1? We need C at 2.

Another word: ""MACRO"" -> M at 1, A at 2? We need A at 5.

I think it's hard. So let's go with ""ACTOR"".

In ""ACTOR"":
  A at 1: if the secret word has A at 1, then it will be marked correct. If not, then we know A must be at 5.
  R at 5: if the secret word has R at 5, then it will be marked correct. If not, then R must be at 4 (since we know R is at 4 or 5 in this case? Actually, if A is at 1, then R must be at 4 or 5. But if in this guess R at 5 is wrong, then R must be at 4.

Also, we are testing T and O.

So let's choose ""ACTOR"".

But note: we are putting R at 5. We know that R cannot be at 2 or 3, but 5 is allowed.

So the guess is ""ACTOR"".

<guess>actor</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  This indicates that C, R, and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively. N and E are absent.

- **Guess 2: ""scrap""** → S(x), C(✓), R(-), A(-), P(x)  
  This confirms:
  - C is **correct and fixed at position 2** (so the word pattern is `_ C _ _ _`).
  - R is in the word but not at position 3 (since it was marked wrong in position 3 here).
  - A is in the word but not at position 4 (since it was marked wrong here).
  - S and P are absent.

### Key Deductions:
1. **C is fixed at position 2**: The word must follow `_ C _ _ _`.
2. **R constraints**: R cannot be at positions 2 or 3. It must be at position 1, 4, or 5.
3. **A constraints**: A cannot be at positions 3 or 4. Since position 2 is taken by C, A must be at position 1 or 5.
4. **Absent letters**: N, E, S, P are not in the word. New guesses must avoid these.
5. **Remaining letters**: The word contains C (at position 2), R, A, and two unknown letters (not N/E/S/P). Common untested letters include O, T, I, L, D, M, etc.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the possible positions for A (1 or 5) and R (1, 4, or 5) while introducing new common letters.
- The word ""actor"" fits perfectly:
  - A at position 1 (tests if A is at position 1).
  - C at position 2 (fixed and correct).
  - T and O at positions 3 and 4 (new common letters to test).
  - R at position 5 (tests if R is at position 5).
- If A is at position 1, it will be marked correct; if not, A must be at 5. Similarly, R at position 5 will provide positional feedback. T and O help cover common letters.

<guess>actor</guess>",actor,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: - (in word, wrong position)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  A: - (in word, wrong position)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""scrap""
  S: x (not in word)
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  A: - (in word, wrong position)
  P: x (not in word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word contains the letters C, R, A (from first guess) and we now know that C is in the correct position at position 2 (from second guess).
2. The secret word does not contain: N, E, S, P.
3. The letter C is fixed at position 2. So the word is: _ C _ _ _
4. The letter R is in the word but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess, because we put R at 3 and it was marked as wrong position). So R must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5.
5. The letter A is in the word but not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 4 (from second guess, because we put A at 4 and it was marked as wrong position). So A must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, or 5. But note: position 2 is already taken by C, so A cannot be at 2. Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 5.

Now, let's list the constraints:

- Position 1: can be R or A (since C is fixed at 2, and we know it's not S, N, E, P). Also, it cannot be any of the absent letters we know (N, E, S, P). But note: we don't know if there are other absent letters. We have to avoid using any of the absent letters (N, E, S, P).
- Position 3: must be a letter that we haven't tried yet? We know that the word has 5 letters and we have C at 2. We know that R and A are not in position 3 (from first guess) and also from the second guess we don't have direct constraint on position 3 except that we put R there and it was wrong, but that doesn't say anything about the letter at position 3. Actually, the feedback for position 3 in the second guess was for R, which we now know is not at 3. But the letter at position 3 in the secret word is still unknown.

We also know that the word must contain R and A, and one more letter (since we have 5 positions and we have C, R, A, and two more? Actually, we have three known letters: C, R, A, and two unknown letters.

But note: we have two positions that must be filled: positions 1, 3, 4, 5? Actually, position 2 is fixed as C. So we have positions 1, 3, 4, 5 to fill with R, A, and two new letters? But wait: we have two known letters (R and A) that must be placed in two of these four positions, and the remaining two positions must be filled with two new letters (that are not N, E, S, P).

However, we have constraints on where R and A can go:

- R can be at 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2 or 3).
- A can be at 1 or 5 (since 2 is taken by C and 3 and 4 are forbidden for A? Wait: from the first guess, A was at 3 and was wrong. From the second guess, A was at 4 and was wrong. So A cannot be at 3 or 4. Therefore, A must be at 1 or 5.

Now, note that if A is at 1, then position 1 is A, and then R must be at 4 or 5. Similarly, if A is at 5, then R can be at 1, 4, or 5? But if A is at 5, then R cannot be at 5 (unless the word has duplicate letters? But we don't know). We haven't seen any duplicate letters so far, so we assume no duplicates until we have evidence.

So let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: A at position 1.
  Then the word is: A C _ _ _
  R must be at 4 or 5.
  The remaining positions (3 and either 4 or 5) must be filled with two new letters (not N, E, S, P).

Case 2: A at position 5.
  Then the word is: _ C _ _ A
  R must be at 1 or 4 (since 5 is taken by A, and we assume no duplicates).
  Then the remaining positions (3 and either 1 or 4) must be filled with new letters.

But note: in case 2, if R is at 1, then the word is: R C _ _ A, and then positions 3 and 4 are new letters. If R is at 4, then the word is: _ C _ R A, and then positions 1 and 3 are new letters.

We need to choose a word that will help us distinguish these cases and also test new letters.

For example, ""A C _ R _"": then the last letter is unknown. Or ""A C _ _ R"".

Common words:

- ""ACRID"": A at 1, C at 2, R at 3? But wait, we know that R cannot be at position 3? From the second guess, we put R at 3 and it was marked as wrong position. So R cannot be at 3. Therefore, in ""ACRID"", R is at 3, which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.

- ""ACTOR"": A at 1, C at 2, T at 3, O at 4, R at 5. This fits: 
  - A at 1: allowed (since A can be at 1)
  - C at 2: fixed
  - T at 3: new letter
  - O at 4: new letter
  - R at 5: allowed (R can be at 5)

Also, avoids N, E, S, P.

So ""ACTOR"" is a valid guess.

Another option: ""ACORN"" -> but N is absent, so no.

""ACHOO"" -> not 5 letters? ""ACHOO"" is 5 letters? A-C-H-O-O. But it has two O's. And we don't know if O is in the word. But N is absent, but we are not using N. However, we have to avoid N, E, S, P. O is allowed. But ""ACHOO"" is an onomatopoeia, might be in the word list? But let's see: we need R in the word. ""ACHOO"" does not have R. But we know R must be in the word. So we cannot use ""ACHOO"".

Another word: ""ACRID"" we already saw R at 3 is forbidden.

""ACOLD"" -> not common, and R is missing.

So ""ACTOR"" seems a good candidate.

But what if the word has A at 5? Then ""ACTOR"" would have A at 1, which might be wrong. But that's okay because we are testing the hypothesis.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at 5 and R at 1? But we couldn't find a common word. Or R at 4.

Let me try to find a word with A at 5 and R at 4: pattern _ C _ R A.

Words: 
  ""OCREA"" -> not common.
  ""ICRA"" is 4 letters.
  ""ZEBRA"" -> but E is absent and Z at 1, E at 2? We need C at 2.

How about ""CIRCA"" -> but C is at 1? We need C at 2.

Another word: ""MACRO"" -> M at 1, A at 2? We need A at 5.

I think it's hard. So let's go with ""ACTOR"".

In ""ACTOR"":
  A at 1: if the secret word has A at 1, then it will be marked correct. If not, then we know A must be at 5.
  R at 5: if the secret word has R at 5, then it will be marked correct. If not, then R must be at 4 (since we know R is at 4 or 5 in this case? Actually, if A is at 1, then R must be at 4 or 5. But if in this guess R at 5 is wrong, then R must be at 4.

Also, we are testing T and O.

So let's choose ""ACTOR"".

But note: we are putting R at 5. We know that R cannot be at 2 or 3, but 5 is allowed.

So the guess is ""ACTOR"".

<guess>actor</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  This indicates that C, R, and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively. N and E are absent.

- **Guess 2: ""scrap""** → S(x), C(✓), R(-), A(-), P(x)  
  This confirms:
  - C is **correct and fixed at position 2** (so the word pattern is `_ C _ _ _`).
  - R is in the word but not at position 3 (since it was marked wrong in position 3 here).
  - A is in the word but not at position 4 (since it was marked wrong here).
  - S and P are absent.

### Key Deductions:
1. **C is fixed at position 2**: The word must follow `_ C _ _ _`.
2. **R constraints**: R cannot be at positions 2 or 3. It must be at position 1, 4, or 5.
3. **A constraints**: A cannot be at positions 3 or 4. Since position 2 is taken by C, A must be at position 1 or 5.
4. **Absent letters**: N, E, S, P are not in the word. New guesses must avoid these.
5. **Remaining letters**: The word contains C (at position 2), R, A, and two unknown letters (not N/E/S/P). Common untested letters include O, T, I, L, D, M, etc.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the possible positions for A (1 or 5) and R (1, 4, or 5) while introducing new common letters.
- The word ""actor"" fits perfectly:
  - A at position 1 (tests if A is at position 1).
  - C at position 2 (fixed and correct).
  - T and O at positions 3 and 4 (new common letters to test).
  - R at position 5 (tests if R is at position 5).
- If A is at position 1, it will be marked correct; if not, A must be at 5. Similarly, R at position 5 will provide positional feedback. T and O help cover common letters.",Guess 3: actor -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) C(✓) T(✓) O(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
