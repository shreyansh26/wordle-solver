We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)
 This means:
   - E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter).
   - N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position (it's in the word elsewhere).
   - C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
   - The 5th letter is E.
   - The word contains the letter N, but not in the 4th position.
   - The letters C, R, A are absent.

 Since the 5th letter is E, we can write the secret word as: _ _ _ _ E

 Also, note that the word has an N, but not in the 4th position. So N must be in one of the first three positions.

 We must avoid using the letters C, R, A in our next guess.

 Let's think of a word that:
   - Ends with E (so the 5th letter is E)
   - Contains the letter N in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position (but not 4th, and we know it's not at the end because the end is E).
   - Does not contain C, R, A.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Since we have only one letter fixed (E at the end) and one known letter (N) that must be in the first three, we can try to use a word that has N in the first position and then uses other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tested.

 We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we must avoid C, R, A.

 Let's try to form a word that starts with N and ends with E, and uses other common letters.

 Example: ""NOISE"" - but we don't know if O, I, S are in the word. However, we can use this to test multiple new letters.

 However, note that in the feedback for ""crane"", the N was marked as present but not in the 4th position. If we put N in the 1st position in our next guess, that might be the correct position.

 But we must consider: the secret word has an N, and it can be in position 1, 2, or 3. So if we put it in position 1, we might get a check or a minus.

 Let's look for words that end with E and have N in the first three, and avoid C, R, A.

 Some possibilities:
   - ""LINE"": but we have only 4 letters? We need 5. So ""LINE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.

   - ""NOISE"": N at position 1, and then O, I, S, E. But note: E is at the end, which we know is correct. So we can use this.

   However, we must check if ""NOISE"" is valid. It is a valid English word.

   But wait: we also know that the secret word has an N, and if we put N at the start, we might get:
        If the secret word has N at position 1: then we get a check for N.
        If the secret word has N at position 2 or 3: then we get a minus for N (because it's present but not at position 1).

   Also, we can test O, I, S.

   Alternatively, we might choose a word that has N in a different position to see if it fits in position 2 or 3.

   However, since we have only 6 tries, we want to maximize information. Putting N in position 1 might be efficient because if it's correct, we have the first letter. If not, then we know N must be in position 2 or 3.

   Let's consider: if we put N in position 1 and it's not correct (i.e., the secret word has N in position 2 or 3), then we get a minus and we know exactly that N is in position 2 or 3. Then we can adjust.

   Also, we can try to use a word that has multiple N's? But the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one N (and it was in the 4th position of the guess, which was wrong). But the secret word might have only one N.

   Since we don't know, let's stick to one N for now.

   Another option: ""UNITE"" - but U is a vowel and we already know A is absent. However, we don't know about U. But note: we have E at the end. Also, ""UNITE"" has U at position 1, N at position 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

   This word avoids C, R, A and tests U, N (in position 2), I, T.

   But we know that the secret word has an N, so if we put N in position 2 and the secret word has N in position 1, then we would get a minus for N? Actually, no: because the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong position is given regardless of how many times it appears? The rules don't specify multiple occurrences. We must assume that the feedback is per letter and per position.

   However, the standard Wordle rules: if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky. But in this case, we don't have any indication of multiple N's. So we assume one N.

   Therefore, if the secret word has N in position 1, then in the guess ""UNITE"", the N (at position 2) would be marked as absent? Actually, no: because the secret word has one N and it is at position 1. Then the N at position 2 in the guess would be marked as absent? But wait, the feedback should mark a letter as present (with a minus) only if it is in the word and not in that position, and if there is another occurrence that hasn't been matched? Actually, the rules are: the feedback is independent per position.

   However, the standard rule is: for each occurrence in the guess, if it matches the same occurrence in the secret, it gets a check. Otherwise, if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret (and that occurrence hasn't been matched to a check or to another minus in the same guess), then it gets a minus. But if the secret has only one N and it is at position 1, then in the guess ""UNITE"", the N at position 2 would not be present (because the secret's N is already matched to the first position? Actually, no: the secret's N is at position 1, and the guess has U at position 1 (which is not N) and N at position 2. Then the secret's N is still available to be matched to the N at position 2? But the position 2 in the guess is not matching the position 1 in the secret? So it would be marked as present but wrong position? 

   Actually, the feedback for the guess ""UNITE"" if the secret word is ""NXXXX"" (with X not N) would be:
        Position 1: U -> not in secret? Then x? But wait, the secret has N at position 1, so U is not N -> so U is absent? Then x.
        Position 2: N -> the secret has N at position 1, so this N is in the secret but not at position 2 -> so minus.

   Therefore, we would get a minus for N even if it is in the secret but at a different position.

   So regardless of where we put the N in the guess, if the secret has an N, we will get either a check (if in the same position) or a minus (if in a different position).

   Therefore, we can choose to put N in any of the first three positions to test.

   Let's choose a word that has N in the first position: for example, ""NOISE"".

   Why ""NOISE""?
      - It ends with E (so we know the last letter is E and we can confirm that).
      - It has N at position 1, which we are testing.
      - It has O, I, S which are common letters we haven't tried.

   Alternatively, we could choose a word that has N in the second position, such as ""INLET"" (if we want to test I and L and T). But note: we know the last letter is E, so ""INLET"" ends with T? No, ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T? That's 5 letters? Actually, ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T? Wait, that would be 5: I, N, L, E, T. But the last letter is T, not E. We need the last letter to be E.

   So we need a word that ends with E and has N in the first three.

   Words like:
      - ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E
      - ""ANISE"": but A is absent, so we cannot use A.
      - ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> ends with E, and N is in position 2.
      - ""SNIPE"": S, N, I, P, E -> ends with E, and N is in position 2.

   Since we cannot use A, we avoid words with A.

   Let's compare:
      ""NOISE"": tests N at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 (which we know is correct).
      ""UNITE"": tests U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.
      ""SNIPE"": tests S at 1, N at 2, I at 3, P at 4, E at 5.

   We want to test as many new letters as possible.

   ""NOISE"" uses O, I, S.
   ""UNITE"" uses U, I, T.
   ""SNIPE"" uses S, I, P.

   We don't have a strong preference, but note that we already know the 5th letter is E, so we don't need to test E again. But we are using it to complete the word.

   Let's choose ""NOISE"" because it tests three new vowels (O and I) and a common consonant (S).

   So our next guess: ""NOISE""

   We hope to get feedback that tells us:
      - If N is in the correct position (position 1) or not.
      - If O, I, S are in the word and in which positions.

   But note: the secret word has an N, so we expect either a check for N (if it's at position 1) or a minus (if it's at position 2 or 3). And we also know that the secret word does not have C, R, A.

   Let's write the guess: ""NOISE""

   Format: <guess>noise</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with E).
- N is present but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).
- C, R, and A are absent (so they can be excluded).

For the next guess, I chose ""noise"" because:
- It ends with E (confirming the known position 5).
- It places N in position 1 (testing if N belongs there).
- It introduces new common letters (O, I, S) to gather more information.
- It avoids the excluded letters C, R, and A.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)
 This means:
   - E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter).
   - N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position (it's in the word elsewhere).
   - C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
   - The 5th letter is E.
   - The word contains the letter N, but not in the 4th position.
   - The letters C, R, A are absent.

 Since the 5th letter is E, we can write the secret word as: _ _ _ _ E

 Also, note that the word has an N, but not in the 4th position. So N must be in one of the first three positions.

 We must avoid using the letters C, R, A in our next guess.

 Let's think of a word that:
   - Ends with E (so the 5th letter is E)
   - Contains the letter N in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position (but not 4th, and we know it's not at the end because the end is E).
   - Does not contain C, R, A.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Since we have only one letter fixed (E at the end) and one known letter (N) that must be in the first three, we can try to use a word that has N in the first position and then uses other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tested.

 We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we must avoid C, R, A.

 Let's try to form a word that starts with N and ends with E, and uses other common letters.

 Example: ""NOISE"" - but we don't know if O, I, S are in the word. However, we can use this to test multiple new letters.

 However, note that in the feedback for ""crane"", the N was marked as present but not in the 4th position. If we put N in the 1st position in our next guess, that might be the correct position.

 But we must consider: the secret word has an N, and it can be in position 1, 2, or 3. So if we put it in position 1, we might get a check or a minus.

 Let's look for words that end with E and have N in the first three, and avoid C, R, A.

 Some possibilities:
   - ""LINE"": but we have only 4 letters? We need 5. So ""LINE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.

   - ""NOISE"": N at position 1, and then O, I, S, E. But note: E is at the end, which we know is correct. So we can use this.

   However, we must check if ""NOISE"" is valid. It is a valid English word.

   But wait: we also know that the secret word has an N, and if we put N at the start, we might get:
        If the secret word has N at position 1: then we get a check for N.
        If the secret word has N at position 2 or 3: then we get a minus for N (because it's present but not at position 1).

   Also, we can test O, I, S.

   Alternatively, we might choose a word that has N in a different position to see if it fits in position 2 or 3.

   However, since we have only 6 tries, we want to maximize information. Putting N in position 1 might be efficient because if it's correct, we have the first letter. If not, then we know N must be in position 2 or 3.

   Let's consider: if we put N in position 1 and it's not correct (i.e., the secret word has N in position 2 or 3), then we get a minus and we know exactly that N is in position 2 or 3. Then we can adjust.

   Also, we can try to use a word that has multiple N's? But the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one N (and it was in the 4th position of the guess, which was wrong). But the secret word might have only one N.

   Since we don't know, let's stick to one N for now.

   Another option: ""UNITE"" - but U is a vowel and we already know A is absent. However, we don't know about U. But note: we have E at the end. Also, ""UNITE"" has U at position 1, N at position 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

   This word avoids C, R, A and tests U, N (in position 2), I, T.

   But we know that the secret word has an N, so if we put N in position 2 and the secret word has N in position 1, then we would get a minus for N? Actually, no: because the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong position is given regardless of how many times it appears? The rules don't specify multiple occurrences. We must assume that the feedback is per letter and per position.

   However, the standard Wordle rules: if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky. But in this case, we don't have any indication of multiple N's. So we assume one N.

   Therefore, if the secret word has N in position 1, then in the guess ""UNITE"", the N (at position 2) would be marked as absent? Actually, no: because the secret word has one N and it is at position 1. Then the N at position 2 in the guess would be marked as absent? But wait, the feedback should mark a letter as present (with a minus) only if it is in the word and not in that position, and if there is another occurrence that hasn't been matched? Actually, the rules are: the feedback is independent per position.

   However, the standard rule is: for each occurrence in the guess, if it matches the same occurrence in the secret, it gets a check. Otherwise, if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret (and that occurrence hasn't been matched to a check or to another minus in the same guess), then it gets a minus. But if the secret has only one N and it is at position 1, then in the guess ""UNITE"", the N at position 2 would not be present (because the secret's N is already matched to the first position? Actually, no: the secret's N is at position 1, and the guess has U at position 1 (which is not N) and N at position 2. Then the secret's N is still available to be matched to the N at position 2? But the position 2 in the guess is not matching the position 1 in the secret? So it would be marked as present but wrong position? 

   Actually, the feedback for the guess ""UNITE"" if the secret word is ""NXXXX"" (with X not N) would be:
        Position 1: U -> not in secret? Then x? But wait, the secret has N at position 1, so U is not N -> so U is absent? Then x.
        Position 2: N -> the secret has N at position 1, so this N is in the secret but not at position 2 -> so minus.

   Therefore, we would get a minus for N even if it is in the secret but at a different position.

   So regardless of where we put the N in the guess, if the secret has an N, we will get either a check (if in the same position) or a minus (if in a different position).

   Therefore, we can choose to put N in any of the first three positions to test.

   Let's choose a word that has N in the first position: for example, ""NOISE"".

   Why ""NOISE""?
      - It ends with E (so we know the last letter is E and we can confirm that).
      - It has N at position 1, which we are testing.
      - It has O, I, S which are common letters we haven't tried.

   Alternatively, we could choose a word that has N in the second position, such as ""INLET"" (if we want to test I and L and T). But note: we know the last letter is E, so ""INLET"" ends with T? No, ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T? That's 5 letters? Actually, ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T? Wait, that would be 5: I, N, L, E, T. But the last letter is T, not E. We need the last letter to be E.

   So we need a word that ends with E and has N in the first three.

   Words like:
      - ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E
      - ""ANISE"": but A is absent, so we cannot use A.
      - ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> ends with E, and N is in position 2.
      - ""SNIPE"": S, N, I, P, E -> ends with E, and N is in position 2.

   Since we cannot use A, we avoid words with A.

   Let's compare:
      ""NOISE"": tests N at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 (which we know is correct).
      ""UNITE"": tests U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.
      ""SNIPE"": tests S at 1, N at 2, I at 3, P at 4, E at 5.

   We want to test as many new letters as possible.

   ""NOISE"" uses O, I, S.
   ""UNITE"" uses U, I, T.
   ""SNIPE"" uses S, I, P.

   We don't have a strong preference, but note that we already know the 5th letter is E, so we don't need to test E again. But we are using it to complete the word.

   Let's choose ""NOISE"" because it tests three new vowels (O and I) and a common consonant (S).

   So our next guess: ""NOISE""

   We hope to get feedback that tells us:
      - If N is in the correct position (position 1) or not.
      - If O, I, S are in the word and in which positions.

   But note: the secret word has an N, so we expect either a check for N (if it's at position 1) or a minus (if it's at position 2 or 3). And we also know that the secret word does not have C, R, A.

   Let's write the guess: ""NOISE""

   Format: <guess>noise</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with E).
- N is present but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).
- C, R, and A are absent (so they can be excluded).

For the next guess, I chose ""noise"" because:
- It ends with E (confirming the known position 5).
- It places N in position 1 (testing if N belongs there).
- It introduces new common letters (O, I, S) to gather more information.
- It avoids the excluded letters C, R, and A.

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)
   - E is in the word and in position 5.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4 (of ""crane"", which is the same as position 4 in the word? Note: positions are absolute).
   - C, R, A are not in the word.

2. ""noise"" -> N(-), O(x), I(✓), S(x), E(✓)
   - I is in the word and in position 3 (since ""noise"" has I in position 3).
- E is in position 5 and correct (we already knew that).
- N is present but not in position 1 (so N is not in position 1 of the secret word).
- O and S are not in the word.

From the feedback, we know:
- The secret word has an E at position 5.
- The secret word has an I at position 3.
- The secret word has an N, but not at position 1 (from guess 2) and not at position 4 (from guess 1). Since the word has 5 positions, N must be in position 2 (because position 3 is taken by I, and we have E at position 5; position 1 is also ruled out by the second guess).
  - Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
  - Position 3: we have I (from the second guess).
  - Position 5: E.
  - So N cannot be in position 1 (second guess), position 4 (first guess), and position 3? But position 3 is I, so N must be in position 2? Or could there be multiple I's? The feedback doesn't indicate multiple I's so we assume I is only at position 3 for now.

Let me recap:
From guess 1: N is in the word but not in position 4. So in the secret word, N is at position 1, 2, or 3.
From guess 2: N is in the word but not in position 1. So now N must be at position 2 or 3.
But in guess 2, position 3 is I, and we have I(✓) meaning the letter at position 3 is I. Therefore, the secret word has I at position 3. Therefore, N cannot be at position 3 (unless there are two I's? But we don't know that). However, the feedback for ""noise"" shows N(-) for position 1 and I(✓) for position 3. If the secret word had N at position 3 and I at another position, then the I in position 3 would not be a check? Actually, no: because the secret word has I at position 3, so the I in position 3 of the guess matches and gets a check. Meanwhile, the N in position 1 of the guess is not in position 1 of the secret, but the secret has an N somewhere else. That N could be at position 2.

So now, we know:
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- N must be in position 2 (because position 1 and 4 are ruled out, and position 3 is I).

Also, we know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, O, S. (from the x's in both guesses).

So the secret word structure: 
Position 1: unknown (but not C,R,A,O,S, and also it cannot be N because if N were at position 1, the second guess would have shown N as present and possibly correct? But it showed N as minus, meaning not at position 1). We also know position 1 is not N.
Position 2: must be N (as deduced above).
Position 3: I
Position 4: unknown (but not C,R,A,O,S)
Position 5: E

So the word is: _ N I _ E

Also, the secret word contains N (at position 2) and I (at 3) and E (at 5). And we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, O, S.

Now, what about the letters from ""crane"" that were absent? We already know C,R,A are absent. And from ""noise"", O and S are absent.

We have two unknown letters: one at position 1 and one at position 4.

We need to find 5-letter words of the form _ N I _ E that do not use C,R,A,O,S and the unknown letters must not be any of the absent ones.

Possible words? Let's think of English words ending in IE? Actually, the pattern is ?N?IE? Wait: the pattern is: letter1, N, I, letter4, E.

So: [letter1] N I [letter4] E

Where letter1 and letter4 can be any letter except: C, R, A, O, S (and also we must avoid N? but N is at position 2, so letter1 and letter4 cannot be N? Actually, they could be? But we don't have information that they are; however, the word might have duplicate letters? Not necessarily.

But in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates. For example, in ""crane"", if the word had two E's, then when we guessed E at the end and it was correct, the other E might have been shown? But we don't have an E in the first guess. So we cannot rule out duplicates.

But for now, let's assume that the letters are unique unless forced.

We need to guess a word that fits the pattern and tests the unknown letters.

Possible words: 
- ""UNITE"": but we have U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5. Will this work? But we haven't tested U and T. However, we must note that ""UNITE"" was considered earlier, but we didn't use it then. Now, does it fit? Position 2 is N, which we think is required. Position 3 is I, required. Position 5 E, required. So it fits. But we must check: is U and T allowed? We don't have information that they are absent so they might be present.

But wait: we have eliminated O and S from the second guess, but U and T haven't been tested. So we can use ""unite"" to test them.

However, in our current pattern, we suspect that position 2 should be N. So ""unite"" has N at position 2? Yes: U (1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). So it fits.

But we are not sure about U and T. It might be the secret word? Or not.

But we need to make a guess that might be the solution or gather more information.

We have 6 guesses total and this is the third guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests more common letters? Like using letters we haven't tried.

But we know many are already excluded: C,R,A,O,S are out. And we have confirmed letters: N at position 2, I at 3, E at 5.

So the remaining unknown letters are position 1 and 4.

We can make a guess that has the known letters in place (N at position 2, I at 3, E at 5) and then guesses for position 1 and 4 that use new letters.

We want to test letters that are common and haven't been excluded.

Excluded letters so far: C, R, A, O, S (and also the letters that are present: N, I, E have been found and partially positioned).

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can choose a word that has N in position 2, I in 3, E in 5, and then position 1 is a new letter, position 4 is a new letter.

For example:
- ""UNIT E"" -> ""UNITE"" as we said, but that has U and T.
- ""ONICE"" -> but O is excluded? So invalid.
- ""ENTRY"" -> E at 1? But we need E at 5. Also, we need N at 2? Not.

So limited words.

Possible words that fit ?N I ? E:

Common words: ""anime"" - but A is excluded.
""unite"" - okay so far?
""knife"" - K and F.
""guide"" - G and D.
""while"" - W and H? But H we haven't tested.

So let's list possible words ending with ""IE"" and having N at position 2 and I at 3? Actually, the pattern is: the word must start with any letter, then N, then I, then any letter, then E.

So: word[0] = ?, word[1]='N', word[2]='I', word[3]=?, word[4]='E'

Examples from English words: unite, knife, smile, guide, while, urine (urine: U R I N E -> but that has R at position 2? No: positions: U(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). So that doesn't fit (we need N at position 2, but this has R at 2). So it's not.

Another: ""anise"" - A excluded.

But we have ""unite"", ""knife"", ""guide"", ""while"", ""smile"", ""alive"" (but A excluded).

So let's see:

- unite: U at 1, T at 4. 
- knife: K at 1, F at 4? (K N I F E)
- guide: G at 1, D at 4? (G U I D E) -> but position 2 is U? No: G(1), U(2), I(3), D(4), E(5). So it does not have N at position 2. 

Mistake: in ""guide"", the second letter is U, not N. So it doesn't fit.

Similarly, ""while"": W(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5) -> does not have N at position 2.

So we need words with the exact pattern: ? N I ? E

Possible:
- ""unite"": U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.
- ""knife"": K at 1, N at 2, I at 3, F at 4, E at 5.
- ""snide"": S at 1? But S is excluded. Moreover, we know S is absent (from guess 2: S was marked x).
- ""smite"": S at 1? Also excluded.
- ""twine"": T at 1, W at 2? No: T W I N E -> positions: T(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). So N is at 4? But we need N at position 2? So no.

Actually, ""twine"" is T-W-I-N-E, so no N at position 2.

Another: ""urine"": U R I N E -> U(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). So N at position 4? But we need N at position 2? No.

How about ""noise"" we already tried? But it had N at 1, which we now know is wrong.

Is there ""onion""? But not ending with E.

What about ""amine""? But 6 letters? And A excluded.

Perhaps ""untie"": U N T I E? But that's U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5). Then position 3 is T? But we require position 3 to be I? Not matching.

So viable words: 
- ""unite"" (K not yet tested? Wait ""unite"" has U and T)
- ""knife"" (K and F)

Are there others? ""maize""? M A I Z E -> no N.

So it appears the only common words that fit the pattern are ""unite"" and ""knife"".

We could consider ""anile"" but A excluded.

So we have candidate solutions: ""unite"" or ""knife"".

Now, we don't know the secret word, but we can guess one of them? Since we have only two, we can guess one and if wrong, then the other.

But we also need to test for the other letters? If we guess ""unite"" and it's not the word, we get feedback that tells us about U and T.

Similarly for ""knife"".

Alternatively, we could make a guess that tests both sets? But we have two unknowns: position 1 and position 4.

But we haven't ruled out many letters? So we can guess a word that uses common letters we haven't used.

But we cannot break the pattern? Actually, we must guess the entire word. But we know positions 2,3,5: must be N, I, E. Positions 1 and 4 are unknowns.

So our guess must be of the form ? N I ? E.

Therefore, we must choose a word like ""unite"" or ""knife"" or that form.

Maybe ""bnize""? Not a word.

So we have to choose between the available English words that fit.

But note that ""unite"" has U and T, ""knife"" has K and F.

We also haven't tested U, T, K, F.

If we guess ""unite"":
- If U is not in the word, then the first letter would be marked as absent? But wait, in ""unite"", position 1 is U and position 4 is T.

The secret word, if it is ""knife"", then U would be absent and T would be absent? But also, position 4 in ""knife"" is F, so T would be absent.

Similarly, if the secret is ""unite"", then we get all correct.

So we can guess one of them.

But note: we have 6 guesses and we are at guess 3. So we can guess ""unite"". If it's not, then we use guess 4 to guess ""knife"", and so on.

But also, we might have other words? For example, ""brine"" but B R? R is excluded? R was absent in the first guess? So no.

Another: ""shine""? S H I N E -> but S is excluded? And also, pattern doesn't have N at position 2: S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). So N at position 4? But we need N at position 2? So it doesn't fit.

How about ""inure""? I N U R E -> but position 1: I? But we require position 3 to be I? Then position 1 must be I? Only if duplicate. And R is excluded.

So I think the only possibilities are ""unite"" and ""knife"".

Therefore, I will guess ""unite"" as the next guess.

Why ""unite""? Because it uses U and T which are vowels and common? Also, if it's correct, we win. If not, we learn about U and T and then can guess ""knife"" next.

But note: there might be less common words? For example:
- ""gnome""? Not ending with E and no N at 2? Doesn't fit.
- ""mnemi""? Not a word.

So I'll go with ""unite"".

Therefore: <guess>unite</guess>

After analyzing the feedback:

### Key Information from Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - C(x), R(x), A(x) → These letters are **absent**.  
   - N(-) → N is in the word but **not in position 4**.  
   - E(✓) → E is **correct and in position 5**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""noise""**  
   - N(-) → N is in the word but **not in position 1**.  
   - O(x), S(x) → These letters are **absent**.  
   - I(✓) → I is **correct and in position 3**.  
   - E(✓) → E is **correct and in position 5** (reconfirms prior knowledge).

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed Positions**:  
  - Position 3: I  
  - Position 5: E  
- **Present Letter with Restrictions**:  
  - N is present but cannot be in positions 1 (from ""noise""), 3 (occupied by I), or 4 (from ""crane""). Thus, **N must be in position 2**.  
- **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, O, S (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Word Structure**: The secret word is of the form `_ N I _ E`.  
- **Unknowns**:  
  - Position 1: Must be a letter not yet tested and not in the absent list.  
  - Position 4: Similarly, must be a new letter not in the absent list.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The word must fit the pattern `? N I ? E`.  
- Excluded letters (C, R, A, O, S) are avoided.  
- Common English words matching this pattern include **""unite""** and **""knife""**.  
- ""unite"" tests U at position 1 and T at position 4, which are common letters and cover new possibilities efficiently.  
- If ""unite"" is incorrect, feedback on U and T will narrow down the options further, allowing a targeted fourth guess (e.g., ""knife"" if U and T are absent).

Thus, the next guess is **""unite""**.  

<guess>unite</guess>",unite,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)
   - E is in the word and in position 5.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4 (of ""crane"", which is the same as position 4 in the word? Note: positions are absolute).
   - C, R, A are not in the word.

2. ""noise"" -> N(-), O(x), I(✓), S(x), E(✓)
   - I is in the word and in position 3 (since ""noise"" has I in position 3).
- E is in position 5 and correct (we already knew that).
- N is present but not in position 1 (so N is not in position 1 of the secret word).
- O and S are not in the word.

From the feedback, we know:
- The secret word has an E at position 5.
- The secret word has an I at position 3.
- The secret word has an N, but not at position 1 (from guess 2) and not at position 4 (from guess 1). Since the word has 5 positions, N must be in position 2 (because position 3 is taken by I, and we have E at position 5; position 1 is also ruled out by the second guess).
  - Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
  - Position 3: we have I (from the second guess).
  - Position 5: E.
  - So N cannot be in position 1 (second guess), position 4 (first guess), and position 3? But position 3 is I, so N must be in position 2? Or could there be multiple I's? The feedback doesn't indicate multiple I's so we assume I is only at position 3 for now.

Let me recap:
From guess 1: N is in the word but not in position 4. So in the secret word, N is at position 1, 2, or 3.
From guess 2: N is in the word but not in position 1. So now N must be at position 2 or 3.
But in guess 2, position 3 is I, and we have I(✓) meaning the letter at position 3 is I. Therefore, the secret word has I at position 3. Therefore, N cannot be at position 3 (unless there are two I's? But we don't know that). However, the feedback for ""noise"" shows N(-) for position 1 and I(✓) for position 3. If the secret word had N at position 3 and I at another position, then the I in position 3 would not be a check? Actually, no: because the secret word has I at position 3, so the I in position 3 of the guess matches and gets a check. Meanwhile, the N in position 1 of the guess is not in position 1 of the secret, but the secret has an N somewhere else. That N could be at position 2.

So now, we know:
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- N must be in position 2 (because position 1 and 4 are ruled out, and position 3 is I).

Also, we know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, O, S. (from the x's in both guesses).

So the secret word structure: 
Position 1: unknown (but not C,R,A,O,S, and also it cannot be N because if N were at position 1, the second guess would have shown N as present and possibly correct? But it showed N as minus, meaning not at position 1). We also know position 1 is not N.
Position 2: must be N (as deduced above).
Position 3: I
Position 4: unknown (but not C,R,A,O,S)
Position 5: E

So the word is: _ N I _ E

Also, the secret word contains N (at position 2) and I (at 3) and E (at 5). And we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, O, S.

Now, what about the letters from ""crane"" that were absent? We already know C,R,A are absent. And from ""noise"", O and S are absent.

We have two unknown letters: one at position 1 and one at position 4.

We need to find 5-letter words of the form _ N I _ E that do not use C,R,A,O,S and the unknown letters must not be any of the absent ones.

Possible words? Let's think of English words ending in IE? Actually, the pattern is ?N?IE? Wait: the pattern is: letter1, N, I, letter4, E.

So: [letter1] N I [letter4] E

Where letter1 and letter4 can be any letter except: C, R, A, O, S (and also we must avoid N? but N is at position 2, so letter1 and letter4 cannot be N? Actually, they could be? But we don't have information that they are; however, the word might have duplicate letters? Not necessarily.

But in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates. For example, in ""crane"", if the word had two E's, then when we guessed E at the end and it was correct, the other E might have been shown? But we don't have an E in the first guess. So we cannot rule out duplicates.

But for now, let's assume that the letters are unique unless forced.

We need to guess a word that fits the pattern and tests the unknown letters.

Possible words: 
- ""UNITE"": but we have U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5. Will this work? But we haven't tested U and T. However, we must note that ""UNITE"" was considered earlier, but we didn't use it then. Now, does it fit? Position 2 is N, which we think is required. Position 3 is I, required. Position 5 E, required. So it fits. But we must check: is U and T allowed? We don't have information that they are absent so they might be present.

But wait: we have eliminated O and S from the second guess, but U and T haven't been tested. So we can use ""unite"" to test them.

However, in our current pattern, we suspect that position 2 should be N. So ""unite"" has N at position 2? Yes: U (1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). So it fits.

But we are not sure about U and T. It might be the secret word? Or not.

But we need to make a guess that might be the solution or gather more information.

We have 6 guesses total and this is the third guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests more common letters? Like using letters we haven't tried.

But we know many are already excluded: C,R,A,O,S are out. And we have confirmed letters: N at position 2, I at 3, E at 5.

So the remaining unknown letters are position 1 and 4.

We can make a guess that has the known letters in place (N at position 2, I at 3, E at 5) and then guesses for position 1 and 4 that use new letters.

We want to test letters that are common and haven't been excluded.

Excluded letters so far: C, R, A, O, S (and also the letters that are present: N, I, E have been found and partially positioned).

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can choose a word that has N in position 2, I in 3, E in 5, and then position 1 is a new letter, position 4 is a new letter.

For example:
- ""UNIT E"" -> ""UNITE"" as we said, but that has U and T.
- ""ONICE"" -> but O is excluded? So invalid.
- ""ENTRY"" -> E at 1? But we need E at 5. Also, we need N at 2? Not.

So limited words.

Possible words that fit ?N I ? E:

Common words: ""anime"" - but A is excluded.
""unite"" - okay so far?
""knife"" - K and F.
""guide"" - G and D.
""while"" - W and H? But H we haven't tested.

So let's list possible words ending with ""IE"" and having N at position 2 and I at 3? Actually, the pattern is: the word must start with any letter, then N, then I, then any letter, then E.

So: word[0] = ?, word[1]='N', word[2]='I', word[3]=?, word[4]='E'

Examples from English words: unite, knife, smile, guide, while, urine (urine: U R I N E -> but that has R at position 2? No: positions: U(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). So that doesn't fit (we need N at position 2, but this has R at 2). So it's not.

Another: ""anise"" - A excluded.

But we have ""unite"", ""knife"", ""guide"", ""while"", ""smile"", ""alive"" (but A excluded).

So let's see:

- unite: U at 1, T at 4. 
- knife: K at 1, F at 4? (K N I F E)
- guide: G at 1, D at 4? (G U I D E) -> but position 2 is U? No: G(1), U(2), I(3), D(4), E(5). So it does not have N at position 2. 

Mistake: in ""guide"", the second letter is U, not N. So it doesn't fit.

Similarly, ""while"": W(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5) -> does not have N at position 2.

So we need words with the exact pattern: ? N I ? E

Possible:
- ""unite"": U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.
- ""knife"": K at 1, N at 2, I at 3, F at 4, E at 5.
- ""snide"": S at 1? But S is excluded. Moreover, we know S is absent (from guess 2: S was marked x).
- ""smite"": S at 1? Also excluded.
- ""twine"": T at 1, W at 2? No: T W I N E -> positions: T(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). So N is at 4? But we need N at position 2? So no.

Actually, ""twine"" is T-W-I-N-E, so no N at position 2.

Another: ""urine"": U R I N E -> U(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). So N at position 4? But we need N at position 2? No.

How about ""noise"" we already tried? But it had N at 1, which we now know is wrong.

Is there ""onion""? But not ending with E.

What about ""amine""? But 6 letters? And A excluded.

Perhaps ""untie"": U N T I E? But that's U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5). Then position 3 is T? But we require position 3 to be I? Not matching.

So viable words: 
- ""unite"" (K not yet tested? Wait ""unite"" has U and T)
- ""knife"" (K and F)

Are there others? ""maize""? M A I Z E -> no N.

So it appears the only common words that fit the pattern are ""unite"" and ""knife"".

We could consider ""anile"" but A excluded.

So we have candidate solutions: ""unite"" or ""knife"".

Now, we don't know the secret word, but we can guess one of them? Since we have only two, we can guess one and if wrong, then the other.

So our guess must be of the form ? N I ? E.

Therefore, we must choose a word like ""unite"" or ""knife"" or that form.

Maybe ""bnize""? Not a word.

So we have to choose between the available English words that fit.

But note that ""unite"" has U and T, ""knife"" has K and F.

We also haven't tested U, T, K, F.

If we guess ""unite"":

But also, we might have other words? For example, ""brine"" but B R? R is excluded? R was absent in the first guess? So no.

Another: ""shine""? S H I N E -> but S is excluded? And also, pattern doesn't have N at position 2: S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). So N at position 4? But we need N at position 2? So it doesn't fit.

How about ""inure""? I N U R E -> but position 1: I? But we require position 3 to be I? Then position 1 must be I? Only if duplicate. And R is excluded.

So I think the only possibilities are ""unite"" and ""knife"".

Therefore, I will guess ""unite"" as the next guess.

Why ""unite""? Because it uses U and T which are vowels and common? Also, if it's correct, we win. If not, we learn about U and T and then can guess ""knife"" next.

   - E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter).
   - N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position (it's in the word elsewhere).
   - C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
   - The 5th letter is E.
   - The word contains the letter N, but not in the 4th position.
   - The letters C, R, A are absent.

 Since the 5th letter is E, we can write the secret word as: _ _ _ _ E

 Also, note that the word has an N, but not in the 4th position. So N must be in one of the first three positions.

 We must avoid using the letters C, R, A in our next guess.

 Let's think of a word that:
   - Ends with E (so the 5th letter is E)
   - Contains the letter N in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position (but not 4th, and we know it's not at the end because the end is E).
   - Does not contain C, R, A.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Since we have only one letter fixed (E at the end) and one known letter (N) that must be in the first three, we can try to use a word that has N in the first position and then uses other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tested.

 We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we must avoid C, R, A.

 Let's try to form a word that starts with N and ends with E, and uses other common letters.

 Example: ""NOISE"" - but we don't know if O, I, S are in the word. However, we can use this to test multiple new letters.

 However, note that in the feedback for ""crane"", the N was marked as present but not in the 4th position. If we put N in the 1st position in our next guess, that might be the correct position.

 But we must consider: the secret word has an N, and it can be in position 1, 2, or 3. So if we put it in position 1, we might get a check or a minus.

 Let's look for words that end with E and have N in the first three, and avoid C, R, A.

 Some possibilities:
   - ""LINE"": but we have only 4 letters? We need 5. So ""LINE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.

   - ""NOISE"": N at position 1, and then O, I, S, E. But note: E is at the end, which we know is correct. So we can use this.

   However, we must check if ""NOISE"" is valid. It is a valid English word.

   But wait: we also know that the secret word has an N, and if we put N at the start, we might get:
        If the secret word has N at position 1: then we get a check for N.
        If the secret word has N at position 2 or 3: then we get a minus for N (because it's present but not at position 1).

   Also, we can test O, I, S.

   Alternatively, we might choose a word that has N in a different position to see if it fits in position 2 or 3.

   However, since we have only 6 tries, we want to maximize information. Putting N in position 1 might be efficient because if it's correct, we have the first letter. If not, then we know N must be in position 2 or 3.

   Let's consider: if we put N in position 1 and it's not correct (i.e., the secret word has N in position 2 or 3), then we get a minus and we know exactly that N is in position 2 or 3. Then we can adjust.

   Also, we can try to use a word that has multiple N's? But the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one N (and it was in the 4th position of the guess, which was wrong). But the secret word might have only one N.

   Since we don't know, let's stick to one N for now.

   Another option: ""UNITE"" - but U is a vowel and we already know A is absent. However, we don't know about U. But note: we have E at the end. Also, ""UNITE"" has U at position 1, N at position 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

   This word avoids C, R, A and tests U, N (in position 2), I, T.

   But we know that the secret word has an N, so if we put N in position 2 and the secret word has N in position 1, then we would get a minus for N? Actually, no: because the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong position is given regardless of how many times it appears? The rules don't specify multiple occurrences. We must assume that the feedback is per letter and per position.

   However, the standard Wordle rules: if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky. But in this case, we don't have any indication of multiple N's. So we assume one N.

   Therefore, if the secret word has N in position 1, then in the guess ""UNITE"", the N (at position 2) would be marked as absent? Actually, no: because the secret word has one N and it is at position 1. Then the N at position 2 in the guess would be marked as absent? But wait, the feedback should mark a letter as present (with a minus) only if it is in the word and not in that position, and if there is another occurrence that hasn't been matched? Actually, the rules are: the feedback is independent per position.

   However, the standard rule is: for each occurrence in the guess, if it matches the same occurrence in the secret, it gets a check. Otherwise, if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret (and that occurrence hasn't been matched to a check or to another minus in the same guess), then it gets a minus. But if the secret has only one N and it is at position 1, then in the guess ""UNITE"", the N at position 2 would not be present (because the secret's N is already matched to the first position? Actually, no: the secret's N is at position 1, and the guess has U at position 1 (which is not N) and N at position 2. Then the secret's N is still available to be matched to the N at position 2? But the position 2 in the guess is not matching the position 1 in the secret? So it would be marked as present but wrong position? 

   Actually, the feedback for the guess ""UNITE"" if the secret word is ""NXXXX"" (with X not N) would be:
        Position 1: U -> not in secret? Then x? But wait, the secret has N at position 1, so U is not N -> so U is absent? Then x.
        Position 2: N -> the secret has N at position 1, so this N is in the secret but not at position 2 -> so minus.

   Therefore, we would get a minus for N even if it is in the secret but at a different position.

   So regardless of where we put the N in the guess, if the secret has an N, we will get either a check (if in the same position) or a minus (if in a different position).

   Therefore, we can choose to put N in any of the first three positions to test.

   Let's choose a word that has N in the first position: for example, ""NOISE"".

   Why ""NOISE""?
      - It ends with E (so we know the last letter is E and we can confirm that).
      - It has N at position 1, which we are testing.
      - It has O, I, S which are common letters we haven't tried.

   Alternatively, we could choose a word that has N in the second position, such as ""INLET"" (if we want to test I and L and T). But note: we know the last letter is E, so ""INLET"" ends with T? No, ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T? That's 5 letters? Actually, ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T? Wait, that would be 5: I, N, L, E, T. But the last letter is T, not E. We need the last letter to be E.

   So we need a word that ends with E and has N in the first three.

   Words like:
      - ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E
      - ""ANISE"": but A is absent, so we cannot use A.
      - ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> ends with E, and N is in position 2.
      - ""SNIPE"": S, N, I, P, E -> ends with E, and N is in position 2.

   Since we cannot use A, we avoid words with A.

   Let's compare:
      ""NOISE"": tests N at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 (which we know is correct).
      ""UNITE"": tests U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.
      ""SNIPE"": tests S at 1, N at 2, I at 3, P at 4, E at 5.

   We want to test as many new letters as possible.

   ""NOISE"" uses O, I, S.
   ""UNITE"" uses U, I, T.
   ""SNIPE"" uses S, I, P.

   We don't have a strong preference, but note that we already know the 5th letter is E, so we don't need to test E again. But we are using it to complete the word.

   Let's choose ""NOISE"" because it tests three new vowels (O and I) and a common consonant (S).

   So our next guess: ""NOISE""

   We hope to get feedback that tells us:
      - If N is in the correct position (position 1) or not.
      - If O, I, S are in the word and in which positions.

   But note: the secret word has an N, so we expect either a check for N (if it's at position 1) or a minus (if it's at position 2 or 3). And we also know that the secret word does not have C, R, A.

   Let's write the guess: ""NOISE""

   Format: <guess>noise</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with E).
- N is present but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).
- C, R, and A are absent (so they can be excluded).

For the next guess, I chose ""noise"" because:
- It ends with E (confirming the known position 5).
- It places N in position 1 (testing if N belongs there).
- It introduces new common letters (O, I, S) to gather more information.
- It avoids the excluded letters C, R, and A.

<guess>noise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: noise -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)
   - E is in the word and in position 5.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4 (of ""crane"", which is the same as position 4 in the word? Note: positions are absolute).
   - C, R, A are not in the word.

2. ""noise"" -> N(-), O(x), I(✓), S(x), E(✓)
   - I is in the word and in position 3 (since ""noise"" has I in position 3).
- E is in position 5 and correct (we already knew that).
- N is present but not in position 1 (so N is not in position 1 of the secret word).
- O and S are not in the word.

From the feedback, we know:
- The secret word has an E at position 5.
- The secret word has an I at position 3.
- The secret word has an N, but not at position 1 (from guess 2) and not at position 4 (from guess 1). Since the word has 5 positions, N must be in position 2 (because position 3 is taken by I, and we have E at position 5; position 1 is also ruled out by the second guess).
  - Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
  - Position 3: we have I (from the second guess).
  - Position 5: E.
  - So N cannot be in position 1 (second guess), position 4 (first guess), and position 3? But position 3 is I, so N must be in position 2? Or could there be multiple I's? The feedback doesn't indicate multiple I's so we assume I is only at position 3 for now.

Let me recap:
From guess 1: N is in the word but not in position 4. So in the secret word, N is at position 1, 2, or 3.
From guess 2: N is in the word but not in position 1. So now N must be at position 2 or 3.
But in guess 2, position 3 is I, and we have I(✓) meaning the letter at position 3 is I. Therefore, the secret word has I at position 3. Therefore, N cannot be at position 3 (unless there are two I's? But we don't know that). However, the feedback for ""noise"" shows N(-) for position 1 and I(✓) for position 3. If the secret word had N at position 3 and I at another position, then the I in position 3 would not be a check? Actually, no: because the secret word has I at position 3, so the I in position 3 of the guess matches and gets a check. Meanwhile, the N in position 1 of the guess is not in position 1 of the secret, but the secret has an N somewhere else. That N could be at position 2.

So now, we know:
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- N must be in position 2 (because position 1 and 4 are ruled out, and position 3 is I).

Also, we know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, O, S. (from the x's in both guesses).

So the secret word structure: 
Position 1: unknown (but not C,R,A,O,S, and also it cannot be N because if N were at position 1, the second guess would have shown N as present and possibly correct? But it showed N as minus, meaning not at position 1). We also know position 1 is not N.
Position 2: must be N (as deduced above).
Position 3: I
Position 4: unknown (but not C,R,A,O,S)
Position 5: E

So the word is: _ N I _ E

Also, the secret word contains N (at position 2) and I (at 3) and E (at 5). And we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, O, S.

Now, what about the letters from ""crane"" that were absent? We already know C,R,A are absent. And from ""noise"", O and S are absent.

We have two unknown letters: one at position 1 and one at position 4.

We need to find 5-letter words of the form _ N I _ E that do not use C,R,A,O,S and the unknown letters must not be any of the absent ones.

Possible words? Let's think of English words ending in IE? Actually, the pattern is ?N?IE? Wait: the pattern is: letter1, N, I, letter4, E.

So: [letter1] N I [letter4] E

Where letter1 and letter4 can be any letter except: C, R, A, O, S (and also we must avoid N? but N is at position 2, so letter1 and letter4 cannot be N? Actually, they could be? But we don't have information that they are; however, the word might have duplicate letters? Not necessarily.

But in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates. For example, in ""crane"", if the word had two E's, then when we guessed E at the end and it was correct, the other E might have been shown? But we don't have an E in the first guess. So we cannot rule out duplicates.

But for now, let's assume that the letters are unique unless forced.

We need to guess a word that fits the pattern and tests the unknown letters.

Possible words: 
- ""UNITE"": but we have U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5. Will this work? But we haven't tested U and T. However, we must note that ""UNITE"" was considered earlier, but we didn't use it then. Now, does it fit? Position 2 is N, which we think is required. Position 3 is I, required. Position 5 E, required. So it fits. But we must check: is U and T allowed? We don't have information that they are absent so they might be present.

But wait: we have eliminated O and S from the second guess, but U and T haven't been tested. So we can use ""unite"" to test them.

However, in our current pattern, we suspect that position 2 should be N. So ""unite"" has N at position 2? Yes: U (1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). So it fits.

But we are not sure about U and T. It might be the secret word? Or not.

But we need to make a guess that might be the solution or gather more information.

We have 6 guesses total and this is the third guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests more common letters? Like using letters we haven't tried.

But we know many are already excluded: C,R,A,O,S are out. And we have confirmed letters: N at position 2, I at 3, E at 5.

So the remaining unknown letters are position 1 and 4.

We can make a guess that has the known letters in place (N at position 2, I at 3, E at 5) and then guesses for position 1 and 4 that use new letters.

We want to test letters that are common and haven't been excluded.

Excluded letters so far: C, R, A, O, S (and also the letters that are present: N, I, E have been found and partially positioned).

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can choose a word that has N in position 2, I in 3, E in 5, and then position 1 is a new letter, position 4 is a new letter.

For example:
- ""UNIT E"" -> ""UNITE"" as we said, but that has U and T.
- ""ONICE"" -> but O is excluded? So invalid.
- ""ENTRY"" -> E at 1? But we need E at 5. Also, we need N at 2? Not.

So limited words.

Possible words that fit ?N I ? E:

Common words: ""anime"" - but A is excluded.
""unite"" - okay so far?
""knife"" - K and F.
""guide"" - G and D.
""while"" - W and H? But H we haven't tested.

So let's list possible words ending with ""IE"" and having N at position 2 and I at 3? Actually, the pattern is: the word must start with any letter, then N, then I, then any letter, then E.

So: word[0] = ?, word[1]='N', word[2]='I', word[3]=?, word[4]='E'

Examples from English words: unite, knife, smile, guide, while, urine (urine: U R I N E -> but that has R at position 2? No: positions: U(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). So that doesn't fit (we need N at position 2, but this has R at 2). So it's not.

Another: ""anise"" - A excluded.

But we have ""unite"", ""knife"", ""guide"", ""while"", ""smile"", ""alive"" (but A excluded).

So let's see:

- unite: U at 1, T at 4. 
- knife: K at 1, F at 4? (K N I F E)
- guide: G at 1, D at 4? (G U I D E) -> but position 2 is U? No: G(1), U(2), I(3), D(4), E(5). So it does not have N at position 2. 

Mistake: in ""guide"", the second letter is U, not N. So it doesn't fit.

Similarly, ""while"": W(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5) -> does not have N at position 2.

So we need words with the exact pattern: ? N I ? E

Possible:
- ""unite"": U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.
- ""knife"": K at 1, N at 2, I at 3, F at 4, E at 5.
- ""snide"": S at 1? But S is excluded. Moreover, we know S is absent (from guess 2: S was marked x).
- ""smite"": S at 1? Also excluded.
- ""twine"": T at 1, W at 2? No: T W I N E -> positions: T(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). So N is at 4? But we need N at position 2? So no.

Actually, ""twine"" is T-W-I-N-E, so no N at position 2.

Another: ""urine"": U R I N E -> U(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). So N at position 4? But we need N at position 2? No.

How about ""noise"" we already tried? But it had N at 1, which we now know is wrong.

Is there ""onion""? But not ending with E.

What about ""amine""? But 6 letters? And A excluded.

Perhaps ""untie"": U N T I E? But that's U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5). Then position 3 is T? But we require position 3 to be I? Not matching.

So viable words: 
- ""unite"" (K not yet tested? Wait ""unite"" has U and T)
- ""knife"" (K and F)

Are there others? ""maize""? M A I Z E -> no N.

So it appears the only common words that fit the pattern are ""unite"" and ""knife"".

We could consider ""anile"" but A excluded.

So we have candidate solutions: ""unite"" or ""knife"".

Now, we don't know the secret word, but we can guess one of them? Since we have only two, we can guess one and if wrong, then the other.

But we also need to test for the other letters? If we guess ""unite"" and it's not the word, we get feedback that tells us about U and T.

Similarly for ""knife"".

Alternatively, we could make a guess that tests both sets? But we have two unknowns: position 1 and position 4.

But we haven't ruled out many letters? So we can guess a word that uses common letters we haven't used.

But we cannot break the pattern? Actually, we must guess the entire word. But we know positions 2,3,5: must be N, I, E. Positions 1 and 4 are unknowns.

So our guess must be of the form ? N I ? E.

Therefore, we must choose a word like ""unite"" or ""knife"" or that form.

Maybe ""bnize""? Not a word.

So we have to choose between the available English words that fit.

But note that ""unite"" has U and T, ""knife"" has K and F.

We also haven't tested U, T, K, F.

If we guess ""unite"":
- If U is not in the word, then the first letter would be marked as absent? But wait, in ""unite"", position 1 is U and position 4 is T.

The secret word, if it is ""knife"", then U would be absent and T would be absent? But also, position 4 in ""knife"" is F, so T would be absent.

Similarly, if the secret is ""unite"", then we get all correct.

So we can guess one of them.

But note: we have 6 guesses and we are at guess 3. So we can guess ""unite"". If it's not, then we use guess 4 to guess ""knife"", and so on.

But also, we might have other words? For example, ""brine"" but B R? R is excluded? R was absent in the first guess? So no.

Another: ""shine""? S H I N E -> but S is excluded? And also, pattern doesn't have N at position 2: S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). So N at position 4? But we need N at position 2? So it doesn't fit.

How about ""inure""? I N U R E -> but position 1: I? But we require position 3 to be I? Then position 1 must be I? Only if duplicate. And R is excluded.

So I think the only possibilities are ""unite"" and ""knife"".

Therefore, I will guess ""unite"" as the next guess.

Why ""unite""? Because it uses U and T which are vowels and common? Also, if it's correct, we win. If not, we learn about U and T and then can guess ""knife"" next.

But note: there might be less common words? For example:
- ""gnome""? Not ending with E and no N at 2? Doesn't fit.
- ""mnemi""? Not a word.

So I'll go with ""unite"".

Therefore: <guess>unite</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

### Key Information from Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - C(x), R(x), A(x) → These letters are **absent**.  
   - N(-) → N is in the word but **not in position 4**.  
   - E(✓) → E is **correct and in position 5**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""noise""**  
   - N(-) → N is in the word but **not in position 1**.  
   - O(x), S(x) → These letters are **absent**.  
   - I(✓) → I is **correct and in position 3**.  
   - E(✓) → E is **correct and in position 5** (reconfirms prior knowledge).

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed Positions**:  
  - Position 3: I  
  - Position 5: E  
- **Present Letter with Restrictions**:  
  - N is present but cannot be in positions 1 (from ""noise""), 3 (occupied by I), or 4 (from ""crane""). Thus, **N must be in position 2**.  
- **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, O, S (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Word Structure**: The secret word is of the form `_ N I _ E`.  
- **Unknowns**:  
  - Position 1: Must be a letter not yet tested and not in the absent list.  
  - Position 4: Similarly, must be a new letter not in the absent list.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The word must fit the pattern `? N I ? E`.  
- Excluded letters (C, R, A, O, S) are avoided.  
- Common English words matching this pattern include **""unite""** and **""knife""**.  
- ""unite"" tests U at position 1 and T at position 4, which are common letters and cover new possibilities efficiently.  
- If ""unite"" is incorrect, feedback on U and T will narrow down the options further, allowing a targeted fourth guess (e.g., ""knife"" if U and T are absent).

Thus, the next guess is **""unite""**.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)\n This means:\n   - E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter).\n   - N is in the secret word but not in the 4th position (it\'s in the word elsewhere).\n   - C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.\n\n Therefore, we know:\n   - The 5th letter is E.\n   - The word contains the letter N, but not in the 4th position.\n   - The letters C, R, A are absent.\n\n Since the 5th letter is E, we can write the secret word as: _ _ _ _ E\n\n Also, note that the word has an N, but not in the 4th position. So N must be in one of the first three positions.\n\n We must avoid using the letters C, R, A in our next guess.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that:\n   - Ends with E (so the 5th letter is E)\n   - Contains the letter N in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position (but not 4th, and we know it\'s not at the end because the end is E).\n   - Does not contain C, R, A.\n\n Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\n Since we have only one letter fixed (E at the end) and one known letter (N) that must be in the first three, we can try to use a word that has N in the first position and then uses other common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tested.\n\n We haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n But note: we must avoid C, R, A.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that starts with N and ends with E, and uses other common letters.\n\n Example: ""NOISE"" - but we don\'t know if O, I, S are in the word. However, we can use this to test multiple new letters.\n\n However, note that in the feedback for ""crane"", the N was marked as present but not in the 4th position. If we put N in the 1st position in our next guess, that might be the correct position.\n\n But we must consider: the secret word has an N, and it can be in position 1, 2, or 3. So if we put it in position 1, we might get a check or a minus.\n\n Let\'s look for words that end with E and have N in the first three, and avoid C, R, A.\n\n Some possibilities:\n   - ""LINE"": but we have only 4 letters? We need 5. So ""LINE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.\n\n   - ""NOISE"": N at position 1, and then O, I, S, E. But note: E is at the end, which we know is correct. So we can use this.\n\n   However, we must check if ""NOISE"" is valid. It is a valid English word.\n\n   But wait: we also know that the secret word has an N, and if we put N at the start, we might get:\n        If the secret word has N at position 1: then we get a check for N.\n        If the secret word has N at position 2 or 3: then we get a minus for N (because it\'s present but not at position 1).\n\n   Also, we can test O, I, S.\n\n   Alternatively, we might choose a word that has N in a different position to see if it fits in position 2 or 3.\n\n   However, since we have only 6 tries, we want to maximize information. Putting N in position 1 might be efficient because if it\'s correct, we have the first letter. If not, then we know N must be in position 2 or 3.\n\n   Let\'s consider: if we put N in position 1 and it\'s not correct (i.e., the secret word has N in position 2 or 3), then we get a minus and we know exactly that N is in position 2 or 3. Then we can adjust.\n\n   Also, we can try to use a word that has multiple N\'s? But the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one N (and it was in the 4th position of the guess, which was wrong). But the secret word might have only one N.\n\n   Since we don\'t know, let\'s stick to one N for now.\n\n   Another option: ""UNITE"" - but U is a vowel and we already know A is absent. However, we don\'t know about U. But note: we have E at the end. Also, ""UNITE"" has U at position 1, N at position 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.\n\n   This word avoids C, R, A and tests U, N (in position 2), I, T.\n\n   But we know that the secret word has an N, so if we put N in position 2 and the secret word has N in position 1, then we would get a minus for N? Actually, no: because the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong position is given regardless of how many times it appears? The rules don\'t specify multiple occurrences. We must assume that the feedback is per letter and per position.\n\n   However, the standard Wordle rules: if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback might be tricky. But in this case, we don\'t have any indication of multiple N\'s. So we assume one N.\n\n   Therefore, if the secret word has N in position 1, then in the guess ""UNITE"", the N (at position 2) would be marked as absent? Actually, no: because the secret word has one N and it is at position 1. Then the N at position 2 in the guess would be marked as absent? But wait, the feedback should mark a letter as present (with a minus) only if it is in the word and not in that position, and if there is another occurrence that hasn\'t been matched? Actually, the rules are: the feedback is independent per position.\n\n   However, the standard rule is: for each occurrence in the guess, if it matches the same occurrence in the secret, it gets a check. Otherwise, if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret (and that occurrence hasn\'t been matched to a check or to another minus in the same guess), then it gets a minus. But if the secret has only one N and it is at position 1, then in the guess ""UNITE"", the N at position 2 would not be present (because the secret\'s N is already matched to the first position? Actually, no: the secret\'s N is at position 1, and the guess has U at position 1 (which is not N) and N at position 2. Then the secret\'s N is still available to be matched to the N at position 2? But the position 2 in the guess is not matching the position 1 in the secret? So it would be marked as present but wrong position? \n\n   Actually, the feedback for the guess ""UNITE"" if the secret word is ""NXXXX"" (with X not N) would be:\n        Position 1: U -> not in secret? Then x? But wait, the secret has N at position 1, so U is not N -> so U is absent? Then x.\n        Position 2: N -> the secret has N at position 1, so this N is in the secret but not at position 2 -> so minus.\n\n   Therefore, we would get a minus for N even if it is in the secret but at a different position.\n\n   So regardless of where we put the N in the guess, if the secret has an N, we will get either a check (if in the same position) or a minus (if in a different position).\n\n   Therefore, we can choose to put N in any of the first three positions to test.\n\n   Let\'s choose a word that has N in the first position: for example, ""NOISE"".\n\n   Why ""NOISE""?\n      - It ends with E (so we know the last letter is E and we can confirm that).\n      - It has N at position 1, which we are testing.\n      - It has O, I, S which are common letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n   Alternatively, we could choose a word that has N in the second position, such as ""INLET"" (if we want to test I and L and T). But note: we know the last letter is E, so ""INLET"" ends with T? No, ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T? That\'s 5 letters? Actually, ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T? Wait, that would be 5: I, N, L, E, T. But the last letter is T, not E. We need the last letter to be E.\n\n   So we need a word that ends with E and has N in the first three.\n\n   Words like:\n      - ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E\n      - ""ANISE"": but A is absent, so we cannot use A.\n      - ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> ends with E, and N is in position 2.\n      - ""SNIPE"": S, N, I, P, E -> ends with E, and N is in position 2.\n\n   Since we cannot use A, we avoid words with A.\n\n   Let\'s compare:\n      ""NOISE"": tests N at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 (which we know is correct).\n      ""UNITE"": tests U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.\n      ""SNIPE"": tests S at 1, N at 2, I at 3, P at 4, E at 5.\n\n   We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n   ""NOISE"" uses O, I, S.\n   ""UNITE"" uses U, I, T.\n   ""SNIPE"" uses S, I, P.\n\n   We don\'t have a strong preference, but note that we already know the 5th letter is E, so we don\'t need to test E again. But we are using it to complete the word.\n\n   Let\'s choose ""NOISE"" because it tests three new vowels (O and I) and a common consonant (S).\n\n   So our next guess: ""NOISE""\n\n   We hope to get feedback that tells us:\n      - If N is in the correct position (position 1) or not.\n      - If O, I, S are in the word and in which positions.\n\n   But note: the secret word has an N, so we expect either a check for N (if it\'s at position 1) or a minus (if it\'s at position 2 or 3). And we also know that the secret word does not have C, R, A.\n\n   Let\'s write the guess: ""NOISE""\n\n   Format: <guess>noise</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with E).\n- N is present but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3).\n- C, R, and A are absent (so they can be excluded).\n\nFor the next guess, I chose ""noise"" because:\n- It ends with E (confirming the known position 5).\n- It places N in position 1 (testing if N belongs there).\n- It introduces new common letters (O, I, S) to gather more information.\n- It avoids the excluded letters C, R, and A.\n\n<guess>noise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: noise -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(✓) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)\n   - E is in the word and in position 5.\n   - N is in the word but not in position 4 (of ""crane"", which is the same as position 4 in the word? Note: positions are absolute).\n   - C, R, A are not in the word.\n\n2. ""noise"" -> N(-), O(x), I(✓), S(x), E(✓)\n   - I is in the word and in position 3 (since ""noise"" has I in position 3).\n- E is in position 5 and correct (we already knew that).\n- N is present but not in position 1 (so N is not in position 1 of the secret word).\n- O and S are not in the word.\n\nFrom the feedback, we know:\n- The secret word has an E at position 5.\n- The secret word has an I at position 3.\n- The secret word has an N, but not at position 1 (from guess 2) and not at position 4 (from guess 1). Since the word has 5 positions, N must be in position 2 (because position 3 is taken by I, and we have E at position 5; position 1 is also ruled out by the second guess).\n  - Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n  - Position 3: we have I (from the second guess).\n  - Position 5: E.\n  - So N cannot be in position 1 (second guess), position 4 (first guess), and position 3? But position 3 is I, so N must be in position 2? Or could there be multiple I\'s? The feedback doesn\'t indicate multiple I\'s so we assume I is only at position 3 for now.\n\nLet me recap:\nFrom guess 1: N is in the word but not in position 4. So in the secret word, N is at position 1, 2, or 3.\nFrom guess 2: N is in the word but not in position 1. So now N must be at position 2 or 3.\nBut in guess 2, position 3 is I, and we have I(✓) meaning the letter at position 3 is I. Therefore, the secret word has I at position 3. Therefore, N cannot be at position 3 (unless there are two I\'s? But we don\'t know that). However, the feedback for ""noise"" shows N(-) for position 1 and I(✓) for position 3. If the secret word had N at position 3 and I at another position, then the I in position 3 would not be a check? Actually, no: because the secret word has I at position 3, so the I in position 3 of the guess matches and gets a check. Meanwhile, the N in position 1 of the guess is not in position 1 of the secret, but the secret has an N somewhere else. That N could be at position 2.\n\nSo now, we know:\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 5: E\n- N must be in position 2 (because position 1 and 4 are ruled out, and position 3 is I).\n\nAlso, we know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, O, S. (from the x\'s in both guesses).\n\nSo the secret word structure: \nPosition 1: unknown (but not C,R,A,O,S, and also it cannot be N because if N were at position 1, the second guess would have shown N as present and possibly correct? But it showed N as minus, meaning not at position 1). We also know position 1 is not N.\nPosition 2: must be N (as deduced above).\nPosition 3: I\nPosition 4: unknown (but not C,R,A,O,S)\nPosition 5: E\n\nSo the word is: _ N I _ E\n\nAlso, the secret word contains N (at position 2) and I (at 3) and E (at 5). And we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, O, S.\n\nNow, what about the letters from ""crane"" that were absent? We already know C,R,A are absent. And from ""noise"", O and S are absent.\n\nWe have two unknown letters: one at position 1 and one at position 4.\n\nWe need to find 5-letter words of the form _ N I _ E that do not use C,R,A,O,S and the unknown letters must not be any of the absent ones.\n\nPossible words? Let\'s think of English words ending in IE? Actually, the pattern is ?N?IE? Wait: the pattern is: letter1, N, I, letter4, E.\n\nSo: [letter1] N I [letter4] E\n\nWhere letter1 and letter4 can be any letter except: C, R, A, O, S (and also we must avoid N? but N is at position 2, so letter1 and letter4 cannot be N? Actually, they could be? But we don\'t have information that they are; however, the word might have duplicate letters? Not necessarily.\n\nBut in the feedback, we haven\'t seen duplicates. For example, in ""crane"", if the word had two E\'s, then when we guessed E at the end and it was correct, the other E might have been shown? But we don\'t have an E in the first guess. So we cannot rule out duplicates.\n\nBut for now, let\'s assume that the letters are unique unless forced.\n\nWe need to guess a word that fits the pattern and tests the unknown letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""UNITE"": but we have U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5. Will this work? But we haven\'t tested U and T. However, we must note that ""UNITE"" was considered earlier, but we didn\'t use it then. Now, does it fit? Position 2 is N, which we think is required. Position 3 is I, required. Position 5 E, required. So it fits. But we must check: is U and T allowed? We don\'t have information that they are absent so they might be present.\n\nBut wait: we have eliminated O and S from the second guess, but U and T haven\'t been tested. So we can use ""unite"" to test them.\n\nHowever, in our current pattern, we suspect that position 2 should be N. So ""unite"" has N at position 2? Yes: U (1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). So it fits.\n\nBut we are not sure about U and T. It might be the secret word? Or not.\n\nBut we need to make a guess that might be the solution or gather more information.\n\nWe have 6 guesses total and this is the third guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests more common letters? Like using letters we haven\'t tried.\n\nBut we know many are already excluded: C,R,A,O,S are out. And we have confirmed letters: N at position 2, I at 3, E at 5.\n\nSo the remaining unknown letters are position 1 and 4.\n\nWe can make a guess that has the known letters in place (N at position 2, I at 3, E at 5) and then guesses for position 1 and 4 that use new letters.\n\nWe want to test letters that are common and haven\'t been excluded.\n\nExcluded letters so far: C, R, A, O, S (and also the letters that are present: N, I, E have been found and partially positioned).\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can choose a word that has N in position 2, I in 3, E in 5, and then position 1 is a new letter, position 4 is a new letter.\n\nFor example:\n- ""UNIT E"" -> ""UNITE"" as we said, but that has U and T.\n- ""ONICE"" -> but O is excluded? So invalid.\n- ""ENTRY"" -> E at 1? But we need E at 5. Also, we need N at 2? Not.\n\nSo limited words.\n\nPossible words that fit ?N I ? E:\n\nCommon words: ""anime"" - but A is excluded.\n""unite"" - okay so far?\n""knife"" - K and F.\n""guide"" - G and D.\n""while"" - W and H? But H we haven\'t tested.\n\nSo let\'s list possible words ending with ""IE"" and having N at position 2 and I at 3? Actually, the pattern is: the word must start with any letter, then N, then I, then any letter, then E.\n\nSo: word[0] = ?, word[1]=\'N\', word[2]=\'I\', word[3]=?, word[4]=\'E\'\n\nExamples from English words: unite, knife, smile, guide, while, urine (urine: U R I N E -> but that has R at position 2? No: positions: U(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). So that doesn\'t fit (we need N at position 2, but this has R at 2). So it\'s not.\n\nAnother: ""anise"" - A excluded.\n\nBut we have ""unite"", ""knife"", ""guide"", ""while"", ""smile"", ""alive"" (but A excluded).\n\nSo let\'s see:\n\n- unite: U at 1, T at 4. \n- knife: K at 1, F at 4? (K N I F E)\n- guide: G at 1, D at 4? (G U I D E) -> but position 2 is U? No: G(1), U(2), I(3), D(4), E(5). So it does not have N at position 2. \n\nMistake: in ""guide"", the second letter is U, not N. So it doesn\'t fit.\n\nSimilarly, ""while"": W(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5) -> does not have N at position 2.\n\nSo we need words with the exact pattern: ? N I ? E\n\nPossible:\n- ""unite"": U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.\n- ""knife"": K at 1, N at 2, I at 3, F at 4, E at 5.\n- ""snide"": S at 1? But S is excluded. Moreover, we know S is absent (from guess 2: S was marked x).\n- ""smite"": S at 1? Also excluded.\n- ""twine"": T at 1, W at 2? No: T W I N E -> positions: T(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). So N is at 4? But we need N at position 2? So no.\n\nActually, ""twine"" is T-W-I-N-E, so no N at position 2.\n\nAnother: ""urine"": U R I N E -> U(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). So N at position 4? But we need N at position 2? No.\n\nHow about ""noise"" we already tried? But it had N at 1, which we now know is wrong.\n\nIs there ""onion""? But not ending with E.\n\nWhat about ""amine""? But 6 letters? And A excluded.\n\nPerhaps ""untie"": U N T I E? But that\'s U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5). Then position 3 is T? But we require position 3 to be I? Not matching.\n\nSo viable words: \n- ""unite"" (K not yet tested? Wait ""unite"" has U and T)\n- ""knife"" (K and F)\n\nAre there others? ""maize""? M A I Z E -> no N.\n\nSo it appears the only common words that fit the pattern are ""unite"" and ""knife"".\n\nWe could consider ""anile"" but A excluded.\n\nSo we have candidate solutions: ""unite"" or ""knife"".\n\nNow, we don\'t know the secret word, but we can guess one of them? Since we have only two, we can guess one and if wrong, then the other.\n\nBut we also need to test for the other letters? If we guess ""unite"" and it\'s not the word, we get feedback that tells us about U and T.\n\nSimilarly for ""knife"".\n\nAlternatively, we could make a guess that tests both sets? But we have two unknowns: position 1 and position 4.\n\nBut we haven\'t ruled out many letters? So we can guess a word that uses common letters we haven\'t used.\n\nBut we cannot break the pattern? Actually, we must guess the entire word. But we know positions 2,3,5: must be N, I, E. Positions 1 and 4 are unknowns.\n\nSo our guess must be of the form ? N I ? E.\n\nTherefore, we must choose a word like ""unite"" or ""knife"" or that form.\n\nMaybe ""bnize""? Not a word.\n\nSo we have to choose between the available English words that fit.\n\nBut note that ""unite"" has U and T, ""knife"" has K and F.\n\nWe also haven\'t tested U, T, K, F.\n\nIf we guess ""unite"":\n- If U is not in the word, then the first letter would be marked as absent? But wait, in ""unite"", position 1 is U and position 4 is T.\n\nThe secret word, if it is ""knife"", then U would be absent and T would be absent? But also, position 4 in ""knife"" is F, so T would be absent.\n\nSimilarly, if the secret is ""unite"", then we get all correct.\n\nSo we can guess one of them.\n\nBut note: we have 6 guesses and we are at guess 3. So we can guess ""unite"". If it\'s not, then we use guess 4 to guess ""knife"", and so on.\n\nBut also, we might have other words? For example, ""brine"" but B R? R is excluded? R was absent in the first guess? So no.\n\nAnother: ""shine""? S H I N E -> but S is excluded? And also, pattern doesn\'t have N at position 2: S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). So N at position 4? But we need N at position 2? So it doesn\'t fit.\n\nHow about ""inure""? I N U R E -> but position 1: I? But we require position 3 to be I? Then position 1 must be I? Only if duplicate. And R is excluded.\n\nSo I think the only possibilities are ""unite"" and ""knife"".\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""unite"" as the next guess.\n\nWhy ""unite""? Because it uses U and T which are vowels and common? Also, if it\'s correct, we win. If not, we learn about U and T and then can guess ""knife"" next.\n\nBut note: there might be less common words? For example:\n- ""gnome""? Not ending with E and no N at 2? Doesn\'t fit.\n- ""mnemi""? Not a word.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""unite"".\n\nTherefore: <guess>unite</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n\n### Key Information from Feedback:\n1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  \n   - C(x), R(x), A(x) → These letters are **absent**.  \n   - N(-) → N is in the word but **not in position 4**.  \n   - E(✓) → E is **correct and in position 5**.  \n\n2. **Guess 2: ""noise""**  \n   - N(-) → N is in the word but **not in position 1**.  \n   - O(x), S(x) → These letters are **absent**.  \n   - I(✓) → I is **correct and in position 3**.  \n   - E(✓) → E is **correct and in position 5** (reconfirms prior knowledge).\n\n### Deductions:\n- **Confirmed Positions**:  \n  - Position 3: I  \n  - Position 5: E  \n- **Present Letter with Restrictions**:  \n  - N is present but cannot be in positions 1 (from ""noise""), 3 (occupied by I), or 4 (from ""crane"").

We have new feedback from Guess 3: ""unite"" -> U(x) N(✓) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)
This feedback tells us:
- U is absent (x)
- N is correct and in position 2 (✓) [which we deduced]
- I is correct and in position 3 (✓) [known]
- T is absent (x)
- E is correct and in position 5 (✓) [known]

So now we know:
- Positions: 2=N, 3=I, 5=E
- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, U, T
- The word structure: _ N I _ E

We also know from previous deductions that position 4 cannot be N (from guess 1) and we now know N is at position 2. Position 1 and 4 are unknown.

Additionally, we must find a letter for position 1 and position 4, avoiding the absent letters.

We had a candidate ""knife"" (K N I F E) as a possibility.

Now, with U and T absent, ""unite"" is ruled out. But ""knife"" remains? Let's check:
- Position 1: K
- Position 2: N (correct)
- Position 3: I (correct)
- Position 4: F
- Position 5: E (correct)

And it avoids all absent letters: C,R,A,O,S,U,T are absent, and K and F are new.

But are there other possibilities?

Other words matching the pattern _ N I _ E:
- ""knife"" - as above
- ""snide"" - S is absent? So no
- ""briar"" - not ending in E? And contains R? Absent
- ""price"" - R? Absent
- ""maize"" - M, A? Absent? A is absent. And no N at 2
- ""guide"" - G U I D E? But here position 2 is U? But we need N at position 2? Doesn't fit
- ""while"" - W H I L E? Position 2 is H? Doesn't have N at 2
- ""shine"" - S absent and incorrect N placement? S at 1? No

Another possibility: ""anise"" - A absent? Not valid.

Or ""spine"" - S absent? Also position 2 is P? No.

So only ""knife"" seems plausible? But wait: what about ""binge""? B I N G E? But that has I at position 2? No: B(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). But we require N at position 2? Not matching.

Alternatively, ""niece""? N I E C E? Doesn't match the structure: N at (1), I at (2), E at (3), C at (4), E at (5). But we require position 2 to be N? And position 3 to be I? Here position 3 is E? Doesn't match.

So ""knife"" is a strong candidate.

But let's confirm the pattern: 
- Position 1: K? Not tested before? 
- Position 4: F? Also not tested.

We haven't received any negative feedback about K or F? So they could be. 

But note: we don't know if the secret word has K or F? So ""knife"" might be it? 

However, we must consider if there are other words? 

Another word: ""fnese""? Not a valid English word? 

""inlet"" - I N L E T? Ends with T? Doesn't end with E? And position 5 is T? We need E at 5? Not valid.

""onion"" - not ending with E.

""minae"" - M I N A E? But A is absent? Doesn’t fit? Also, positions: M(1), I(2), N(3), A(4), E(5). Position 2 is I? We need N at position 2? So no.

So ""knife"" seems to be the only common word that fits the pattern and avoids the absent letters? 

Therefore, we guess ""knife"" as the next word? 

But note: we are at guess 4? And if ""knife"" is correct, we win. If not, we have to figure out? But what if there are other words we haven't thought of? 

For example, ""enigma""? 6 letters.

Or ""bible""? Not matching.

Or ""driven""? Wrong pattern? D R I V E N? Too long.

Or 5-letter words: ""quire""? Q U I R E? Has U and R? Absent. No N.

""gripe""? G R I P E? Has R? Absent? And no N at 2.

""white""? W H I T E? Has T? Absent? And no N.

Well, seems ""knife"" is the best shot.

But let me double-check: is there any other? 

Another possibility: ""knive"" or ""knave""?
- ""knave"": K N A V E? But A is absent? Also, position 3 is A? But we need I? So no.
- ""knive""? K N I V E? That's the same as ""knife""? But wait, ""knive"" is an archaic or variant spelling? Typically ""knife"".

But ""knive"" might not be accepted? In the game, we must choose valid words? So ""knife"" is standard.

Therefore, we guess ""knife"".

So the next guess is ""knife"".

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### **Previous Feedback Recap:**
1. **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)`  
   - **Absent letters**: C, R, A  
   - **Present but misplaced**: N (not in position 4)  
   - **Correct position**: E (position 5)  

2. **Guess 2: ""noise""** → Feedback: `N(-) O(x) I(✓) S(x) E(✓)`  
   - **Absent letters**: O, S  
   - **Present but misplaced**: N (not in position 1)  
   - **Correct positions**: I (position 3), E (position 5, confirmed)  

3. **Guess 3: ""unite""** → Feedback: `U(x) N(✓) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)`  
   - **Absent letters**: U, T  
   - **Correct positions**: N (position 2), I (position 3), E (position 5)  

#### **Deductions So Far:**
- **Confirmed Positions**:  
  - Position 2: `N`  
  - Position 3: `I`  
  - Position 5: `E`  
- **Word Pattern**: `_ N I _ E` (unknowns at positions 1 and 4).  
- **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, O, S, U, T (excluded from all guesses).  
- **Key Insights**:  
  - N must be in position 2 (ruling out positions 1, 3, 4, and 5).  
  - Position 1 and 4 must be new letters not in the absent list.  

#### **Constraints for Next Guess:**
- The word must match `? N I ? E`.  
- Avoid absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, U, T.  
- Test new letters to identify the unknowns (position 1 and 4).  

#### **Candidate Word Selection:**
- Common English words fitting `? N I ? E` and avoiding absent letters:  
  - **""knife""**: K (position 1), F (position 4).  
    - ✔️ Valid pattern, checks new letters: K and F.  
    - ❗ Remaining candidate after eliminating ""unite"" (which tested U/T).  
  - Other potential words like ""snide"" (S absent), ""guide"" (no N at position 2), or ""amine"" (A absent) are invalid.  
- ""knife"" maximizes new information:  
  - If ""knife"" is correct, game ends.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on K and F reveals which letter/position is wrong (narrowing to other candidates like ""bnize"" - invalid, or rare words).  

**Resulting Guess:** ""knife"".  

<guess>knife</guess>",knife,"We have new feedback from Guess 3: ""unite"" -> U(x) N(✓) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)

- N is correct and in position 2 (✓) [which we deduced]
- I is correct and in position 3 (✓) [known]

So now we know:
- Positions: 2=N, 3=I, 5=E
- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, S, U, T
