 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

We are given that the first guess ""crane"" resulted in all letters being incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Therefore, we must choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to pick a word that uses other common letters to maximize the information we get.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, A, N, E) might include: S, T, I, O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""SLOTH"" or ""PIOUS"", but let's think of one that uses as many common letters as possible.

 Another popular starting word is ""SPLIT"", but note that we have to avoid the letters we know are absent.

 Alternatively, we can use ""MOIST"" or ""BUILD"". However, we must ensure the word is valid.

 Since we have eliminated 5 letters, we have a lot of options.

 Let me consider: 
 - S, T, L, I, O are still available and common.

 I think ""TOILS"" is a word, but let's pick one that has distinct letters to cover more ground.

 How about ""SLIPT""? But that might not be common. Instead, let's use ""SPLIT"".

 But wait: ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T. None of these are in the excluded set (C, R, A, N, E). So that's acceptable.

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" is not acceptable because it has N which we know is absent.

 Another option: ""MOUTH"" -> M, O, U, T, H. None of these are excluded.

 But I think ""SLIMY"" might be good? But Y is less common.

 Let's go with a word that has S, T, and L, which are very common.

 I'll choose ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H. All these letters are not in the excluded set.

 However, note that we have 6 tries and we want to maximize information. Another good word is ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S.

 But I think ""SLOTH"" is a valid choice.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"" has S, H, O, U, T.

 Since we have no information, we can also consider ""OUIJA"" but that has repeated letters and is not common.

 I think I'll go with ""SPLIT"" because it has common consonants and a vowel.

 But wait: we know that the word does not have A, E, I? Actually, we don't know about I because we haven't tried it. The first guess only eliminated C, R, A, N, E. So I is still possible.

 However, note that the first guess was ""crane"" and we got all x's, so I is not in the word? Wait, no: the word ""crane"" does not contain the letter I. So we have not tested I at all.

 Therefore, we should include I in our next guess to test it.

 Similarly, we haven't tested O, U, etc.

 So let's choose a word that includes I and other common letters.

 I'll go with ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T.

 This way, we test S, P, L, I, T.

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" is not possible because of N. We know N is absent.

 Another word: ""BUILD"" -> B, U, I, L, D. This is also acceptable.

 But I think ""SPLIT"" is a good choice.

 However, note that we have to avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E. ""SPLIT"" does not contain any of these.

 So I will guess ""SPLIT"".

 But let me double-check: 
   S: not in {C,R,A,N,E} -> okay
   P: not in -> okay
   L: not in -> okay
   I: not in -> okay (because we haven't tested it, but it's not excluded by the first guess)
   T: not in -> okay

 Therefore, I choose ""SPLIT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. For the next guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that excludes C, R, A, N, E and includes other common letters to maximize information. 

I selected **""split""** because:
- It uses high-frequency consonants (S, P, L, T) and a common vowel (I), which are untested so far.
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.
- It avoids the excluded letters from the first guess.

2. ""split"" -> feedback: S(x), P(-), L(-), I(x), T(x). 
   - S(x) and I(x) and T(x) mean that S, I, T are also absent from the secret word. So now we know the secret word has none of: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, T.
   - P(-) means P is in the secret word but not in the second position (since in ""split"", P is at position 2 and we got a minus). 
   - L(-) means L is in the secret word but not in the third position (since in ""split"", L is at position 3).

So we now know:
- The secret word contains the letters P and L, but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively (and note, since the word has 5 letters, we have positions 1 to 5).
- We have eliminated the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, T. So we must avoid these.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Includes P and L (since we know they are present) but not at the wrong positions.
- Must not use any of the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, T.
- We have to cover the remaining letters to find the word.

Now, what letters are left? From the English alphabet, excluding the eliminated ones: 
Eliminated: A, C, E, I, N, R, S, T.
So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we know P and L are in the word, so we must include them. Also, the positions for P and L cannot be the same as in the previous guess? Actually, the feedback for ""split"":
- P(-) at position 2: so in the secret word, P is present but not at position 2.
- L(-) at position 3: so L is present but not at position 3.

So when we make the new word:
- P cannot be in position 2 (but can be in 1,3,4,5? Actually, we don't know which positions are allowed, except not position 2 for P and not position 3 for L).
- We must place P and L in positions where they haven't been tried and found to be absent? Actually, we haven't tested P in positions other than 2, and L in positions other than 3.

Also, note: the word must be 5 letters and a real English word.

We can try to think of words that contain both P and L, and the other letters are from the available set.

Common words: 
- ""PLUMB"" but has B? That's okay. Let's check: P, L, U, M, B. U, M, B are available? U is available? We haven't eliminated U. But note: we don't know if U is in or not. Also, positions matter.

But: P must not be at position 2. In ""split"", P was at position 2. So in the new word, if we put P at position 1?
Similarly, L was at position 3 in ""split"", so avoid L at position 3.

Let's try a word with P at the beginning? Like ""PLUMY"", but that's not common.

Alternatively, ""POLYP"" but O is available? And that repeats P? We don't know if repetition is allowed? The rules don't specify, but typically Wordle words don't have repeated letters unless they can. But for simplicity, let's assume no repetition until told otherwise? Actually, the feedback doesn't forbid it.

But in the previous feedback, we didn't have any repeated letters so let's avoid repetition for now.

Another idea: ""PLUCK"" has C and C is eliminated? So no.

How about ""GLYPH""? G, L, Y, P, H. This has P and L. And G, Y, H are available letters.

Placement: 
In ""GLYPH"": 
P is at position 5 (not 2, so okay for P). 
L is at position 2 (wasn't position 3, so not forbidden? We only know L is not at position 3, so position 2 is allowed? But we got L(-) meaning L is in the word but not at position 3. It could be at position 2? However, in ""split"", L was at 3 and was marked minus so position 3 was wrong for L. It doesn't say anything about other positions.

But wait: in the word ""split"", L was absent? No: the feedback was L(-), and minus means ""in the word but wrong position"". So L is present. Similarly, P is present.

So in ""GLYPH"": 
- P is at position 5 -> let's hope it's correct? We don't know. 
- L is at position 2 -> this is acceptable because previously L was at position 3, and now we are trying position 2.

But we need to test for other letters too.

Alternatively, we can consider other words.

Another word: ""PLUSH"" -> P, L, U, S, H. But wait: S is eliminated! We know S is absent (from guess 2: S(x)). So we cannot use S.

So avoid any eliminated letters: A, C, E, I, N, R, S, T.

So back to ""GLYPH"": it uses G, L, Y, P, H. All letters are allowed: G, Y, H haven't been tested and are available.

But note: the word ""glyph"" might be considered too obscure? But the rules didn't specify common words, but typically we use common words. Maybe we can pick a more common one.

Another word: ""HUMOR"" but has R? R is eliminated? From guess1: R(x) eliminated R.

So no.

Word: ""FLOOD"" but has O, and O is available? But then two O's? And also D available.

But it doesn't have P? We must include P because we know P is in the word.

We must include P and L.

So words containing both P and L.

Another word: ""APPLY"" has A and A is eliminated? A is from first guess, A(x) so absent.

""PLUM"": too short? 4 letters.

""PLUMB"": 5 letters: P, L, U, M, B. Available letters.

Placement: 
If we put P at 1, L at 2? But wait: P cannot be at position 2? Actually, we can put P at any position except position 2? Actually, we don't know. The feedback for P(-) means that for the guess ""split"", at position 2, P is present elsewhere. So in the secret word, P is at one of the positions: 1,3,4,5? But we haven't tried position 1 for P, so we can.

Similarly for L: it can be at 1,2,4,5? Because position 3 is wrong.

In ""PLUMB"": 
- P at position 1: possible? Yes, because we haven't tested P at position 1. 
- L at position 2: possible? Yes, because we haven't tested L at position 2? Previously L was at position 3, not 2.

So ""PLUMB"" might be acceptable? 

But let me see: 
- P in position 1? We got feedback for P that it's in the word but not at position 2, so position 1 is still allowed.
- Similarly, L in position 2 is allowed because we only know it's not at position 3.

The problem: we also eliminated U and M and B? No, we haven't. They are available.

But is ""plumb"" a common word? It might be acceptable.

Another word: ""PLUME"" but E is eliminated.

""PLANK"" has A and N, eliminated.

""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P. But I is eliminated? From guess2: I(x), so I is absent. So no.

""CLAMP"" has C and A, eliminated.

So ""PLUMB"" seems a candidate: letters P, L, U, M, B. All not eliminated.

But note: the feedback from guess2 also says that T, S, I are absent so we avoid them.

So I think ""PLUMB"" is a word we can use.

But let's think of another word without putting P and L at the first two positions? Because we are not sure if they are in those positions.

Another word: ""LUMPY"" -> L, U, M, P, Y. This has L and P. Placement: L at position 1, U at 2, M at 3, P at4, Y at5.

Now, for L: position 1 (wasn't position 3, so okay). For P: position 4 (wasn't position 2, so okay).

It also uses U, M, Y. Available letters.

Similarly, ""GUILD"" but has U, I, D? I is eliminated. So no.

""POLLY"" has O, L, L, Y? But repeated L, and O and Y are available, but no P? Wait, we don't have P? We need P.

We know P must be included, so ""POLLY"" does not have P.

""FLAPS"" has S, and eliminated? S is eliminated.

So ""LUMPY"" might be good? But we have to hope it's a word.

Similarly, ""PLUMP"" has repeated P? And M and P? But then we don't use new letters? Actually, it's valid: P, L, U, M, P. But repeated P? So we might not get information about other letters.

That might not be efficient.

Alternatively, ""OUPHE"" is not common.

I think ""PLUMB"" or ""LUMPY"" are acceptable.

But to maximize information, we want to try letters that haven't been tested. We have tested P and L, but we haven't tested U, M, B, Y, G, etc.

So ""PLUMB"" tests U, M, B in addition to P and L.

""PLUMB"" also places P and L at positions 1 and 2, which might help.

Similarly, ""BLIMP"" was eliminated because of I.

What about ""PLUNK"" has N? N is eliminated.

""FLUNG"" has F, L, U, N, G? But N is eliminated.

So hard.

Another word: ""BUMPH"" - B, U, M, P, H? Or ""BUMPY"" - B, U, M, P, Y? This has L? No it doesn't have L? We must include L.

We must include both P and L.

So words containing P and L: 
- PLUMB, LUMPY, but also ""GULPY""? Not a word.
- Or ""LYMPH"" -> L, Y, M, P, H? This has M and H? And Y? Available.

""LYMPH"": 
- Position1: L -> okay (not position 3)
- Position4: P -> okay (not position 2)
- Letters: L, Y, M, P, H -> available.

Is ""lymph"" a word? Yes, a common one.

And it avoids the eliminated letters.

In ""lymph"": 
- L at position 1: we haven't tested L at 1. 
- P at position 4: we haven't tested P at 4.

So it's a good candidate.

We can also consider ""BLYTH"" but that's not common.

I think ""lymph"" is a good choice: common word, uses L and P, and introduces Y, M, H.

But note: we cannot have L at position 3? We don't know, but we avoid position 3 for L? Actually, in this word L is at position 1 -> okay.

So I'll choose ""LYMPH"".

But let me confirm the previous feedback: 
Guess1: crane -> all x
Guess2: split -> S(x), P(-), L(-), I(x), T(x)

So yes, eliminated letters: A,C,E,I,N,R,S,T.

""LYMPH"" contains L, Y, M, P, H: 
- L: not eliminated? Not eliminated because we know it's in the word? From L(-).
- Y, M, P, H: not in eliminated list? Correct.

And P and L are placed in new positions: L at 1, P at 4.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""lymph"".
</think>
After analyzing the previous feedback:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E), so none of these are in the secret word.
- ""split"" had:
  - S(x) and I(x) and T(x): S, I, T are also not in the secret word.
  - P(-): P is in the word but not in position 2.
  - L(-): L is in the word but not in position 3.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, T.
- Confirmed present letters: P and L (with P not in position 2, L not in position 3).

For the new guess:
- Must include P and L, avoiding positions revealed as wrong for each (P not pos 2, L not pos 3).
- Avoid all eliminated letters (A, C, E, I, N, R, S, T).
- Use untested common letters to maximize information (e.g., M, Y, H).

The word ""lymph"" fits:
- Contains P and L (P at position 4, not 2; L at position 1, not 3).
- Uses untested letters: Y, M, H.
- No eliminated letters.
- Valid English word.

<guess>lymph</guess>",lymph,"We have two guesses and their feedback:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word contains none of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

2. ""split"" -> feedback: S(x), P(-), L(-), I(x), T(x). 
   - S(x) and I(x) and T(x) mean that S, I, T are also absent from the secret word. So now we know the secret word has none of: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, T.
   - P(-) means P is in the secret word but not in the second position (since in ""split"", P is at position 2 and we got a minus).

But: P must not be at position 2. In ""split"", P was at position 2. So in the new word, if we put P at position 1?
Similarly, L was at position 3 in ""split"", so avoid L at position 3.

Let's try a word with P at the beginning? Like ""PLUMY"", but that's not common.

How about ""GLYPH""? G, L, Y, P, H. This has P and L. And G, Y, H are available letters.

Placement: 
In ""GLYPH"": 
P is at position 5 (not 2, so okay for P). 
L is at position 2 (wasn't position 3, so not forbidden? We only know L is not at position 3, so position 2 is allowed? But we got L(-) meaning L is in the word but not at position 3.

So in ""GLYPH"": 
- P is at position 5 -> let's hope it's correct? We don't know. 
- L is at position 2 -> this is acceptable because previously L was at position 3, and now we are trying position 2.

But we need to test for other letters too.

Alternatively, we can consider other words.

Another word: ""PLUSH"" -> P, L, U, S, H. But wait: S is eliminated! We know S is absent (from guess 2: S(x)). So we cannot use S.

So avoid any eliminated letters: A, C, E, I, N, R, S, T.

So back to ""GLYPH"": it uses G, L, Y, P, H. All letters are allowed: G, Y, H haven't been tested and are available.

But note: the word ""glyph"" might be considered too obscure? But the rules didn't specify common words, but typically we use common words. Maybe we can pick a more common one.

We must include P and L.

So words containing both P and L.

Another word: ""APPLY"" has A and A is eliminated? A is from first guess, A(x) so absent.

""PLUM"": too short? 4 letters.

""PLUMB"": 5 letters: P, L, U, M, B. Available letters.

Placement: 
If we put P at 1, L at 2? But wait: P cannot be at position 2? Actually, we can put P at any position except position 2? Actually, we don't know. The feedback for P(-) means that for the guess ""split"", at position 2, P is present elsewhere. So in the secret word, P is at one of the positions: 1,3,4,5? But we haven't tried position 1 for P, so we can.

Similarly for L: it can be at 1,2,4,5? Because position 3 is wrong.

In ""PLUMB"": 
- P at position 1: possible? Yes, because we haven't tested P at position 1. 
- L at position 2: possible? Yes, because we haven't tested L at position 2? Previously L was at position 3, not 2.

So ""PLUMB"" might be acceptable? 

But let me see: 
- P in position 1? We got feedback for P that it's in the word but not at position 2, so position 1 is still allowed.
- Similarly, L in position 2 is allowed because we only know it's not at position 3.

The problem: we also eliminated U and M and B? No, we haven't. They are available.

But is ""plumb"" a common word? It might be acceptable.

Another word: ""PLUME"" but E is eliminated.

""PLANK"" has A and N, eliminated.

""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P. But I is eliminated? From guess2: I(x), so I is absent. So no.

""CLAMP"" has C and A, eliminated.

So ""PLUMB"" seems a candidate: letters P, L, U, M, B. All not eliminated.

But note: the feedback from guess2 also says that T, S, I are absent so we avoid them.

So I think ""PLUMB"" is a word we can use.

But let's think of another word without putting P and L at the first two positions? Because we are not sure if they are in those positions.

Another word: ""LUMPY"" -> L, U, M, P, Y. This has L and P. Placement: L at position 1, U at 2, M at 3, P at4, Y at5.

Now, for L: position 1 (wasn't position 3, so okay). For P: position 4 (wasn't position 2, so okay).

It also uses U, M, Y. Available letters.

Similarly, ""GUILD"" but has U, I, D? I is eliminated. So no.

""POLLY"" has O, L, L, Y? But repeated L, and O and Y are available, but no P? Wait, we don't have P? We need P.

We know P must be included, so ""POLLY"" does not have P.

""FLAPS"" has S, and eliminated? S is eliminated.

So ""LUMPY"" might be good? But we have to hope it's a word.

Similarly, ""PLUMP"" has repeated P? And M and P? But then we don't use new letters? Actually, it's valid: P, L, U, M, P. But repeated P? So we might not get information about other letters.

That might not be efficient.

Alternatively, ""OUPHE"" is not common.

I think ""PLUMB"" or ""LUMPY"" are acceptable.

But to maximize information, we want to try letters that haven't been tested. We have tested P and L, but we haven't tested U, M, B, Y, G, etc.

So ""PLUMB"" tests U, M, B in addition to P and L.

""PLUMB"" also places P and L at positions 1 and 2, which might help.

Similarly, ""BLIMP"" was eliminated because of I.

What about ""PLUNK"" has N? N is eliminated.

""FLUNG"" has F, L, U, N, G? But N is eliminated.

So hard.

Another word: ""BUMPH"" - B, U, M, P, H? Or ""BUMPY"" - B, U, M, P, Y? This has L? No it doesn't have L? We must include L.

We must include both P and L.

So words containing P and L: 
- PLUMB, LUMPY, but also ""GULPY""? Not a word.
- Or ""LYMPH"" -> L, Y, M, P, H? This has M and H? And Y? Available.

""LYMPH"": 
- Position1: L -> okay (not position 3)
- Position4: P -> okay (not position 2)
- Letters: L, Y, M, P, H -> available.

Is ""lymph"" a word? Yes, a common one.

And it avoids the eliminated letters.

In ""lymph"": 
- L at position 1: we haven't tested L at 1. 
- P at position 4: we haven't tested P at 4.

So it's a good candidate.

We can also consider ""BLYTH"" but that's not common.

I think ""lymph"" is a good choice: common word, uses L and P, and introduces Y, M, H.

But note: we cannot have L at position 3? We don't know, but we avoid position 3 for L? Actually, in this word L is at position 1 -> okay.

So I'll choose ""LYMPH"".

But let me confirm the previous feedback: 
Guess1: crane -> all x
Guess2: split -> S(x), P(-), L(-), I(x), T(x)

So yes, eliminated letters: A,C,E,I,N,R,S,T.

""LYMPH"" contains L, Y, M, P, H: 
- L: not eliminated? Not eliminated because we know it's in the word? From L(-).
- Y, M, P, H: not in eliminated list? Correct.

And P and L are placed in new positions: L at 1, P at 4.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""lymph"".After analyzing the previous feedback:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E), so none of these are in the secret word.
- ""split"" had:
  - S(x) and I(x) and T(x): S, I, T are also not in the secret word.
  - P(-): P is in the word but not in position 2.
  - L(-): L is in the word but not in position 3.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, T.
- Confirmed present letters: P and L (with P not in position 2, L not in position 3).

For the new guess:
- Must include P and L, avoiding positions revealed as wrong for each (P not pos 2, L not pos 3).
- Avoid all eliminated letters (A, C, E, I, N, R, S, T).
- Use untested common letters to maximize information (e.g., M, Y, H).

The word ""lymph"" fits:
- Contains P and L (P at position 4, not 2; L at position 1, not 3).
- Uses untested letters: Y, M, H.
- No eliminated letters.
- Valid English word.",Guess 3: lymph -> FEEDBACK: L(-) Y(x) M(-) P(-) H(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,plumb,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given that the first guess ""crane"" resulted in all letters being incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Therefore, we must choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to pick a word that uses other common letters to maximize the information we get.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, A, N, E) might include: S, T, I, O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""SLOTH"" or ""PIOUS"", but let's think of one that uses as many common letters as possible.

 Another popular starting word is ""SPLIT"", but note that we have to avoid the letters we know are absent.

 Alternatively, we can use ""MOIST"" or ""BUILD"". However, we must ensure the word is valid.

 Since we have eliminated 5 letters, we have a lot of options.

 Let me consider: 
 - S, T, L, I, O are still available and common.

 I think ""TOILS"" is a word, but let's pick one that has distinct letters to cover more ground.

 How about ""SLIPT""? But that might not be common. Instead, let's use ""SPLIT"".

 But wait: ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T. None of these are in the excluded set (C, R, A, N, E). So that's acceptable.

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" is not acceptable because it has N which we know is absent.

 Another option: ""MOUTH"" -> M, O, U, T, H. None of these are excluded.

 But I think ""SLIMY"" might be good? But Y is less common.

 Let's go with a word that has S, T, and L, which are very common.

 I'll choose ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H. All these letters are not in the excluded set.

 However, note that we have 6 tries and we want to maximize information. Another good word is ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S.

 But I think ""SLOTH"" is a valid choice.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"" has S, H, O, U, T.

 Since we have no information, we can also consider ""OUIJA"" but that has repeated letters and is not common.

 I think I'll go with ""SPLIT"" because it has common consonants and a vowel.

 But wait: we know that the word does not have A, E, I? Actually, we don't know about I because we haven't tried it. The first guess only eliminated C, R, A, N, E. So I is still possible.

 However, note that the first guess was ""crane"" and we got all x's, so I is not in the word? Wait, no: the word ""crane"" does not contain the letter I. So we have not tested I at all.

 Therefore, we should include I in our next guess to test it.

 Similarly, we haven't tested O, U, etc.

 So let's choose a word that includes I and other common letters.

 I'll go with ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T.

 This way, we test S, P, L, I, T.

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" is not possible because of N. We know N is absent.

 Another word: ""BUILD"" -> B, U, I, L, D. This is also acceptable.

 But I think ""SPLIT"" is a good choice.

 However, note that we have to avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E. ""SPLIT"" does not contain any of these.

 So I will guess ""SPLIT"".

 But let me double-check: 
   S: not in {C,R,A,N,E} -> okay
   P: not in -> okay
   L: not in -> okay
   I: not in -> okay (because we haven't tested it, but it's not excluded by the first guess)
   T: not in -> okay

 Therefore, I choose ""SPLIT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. For the next guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that excludes C, R, A, N, E and includes other common letters to maximize information. 

I selected **""split""** because:
- It uses high-frequency consonants (S, P, L, T) and a common vowel (I), which are untested so far.
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.
- It avoids the excluded letters from the first guess.

<guess>split</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: split -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(-) L(-) I(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word contains none of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

2. ""split"" -> feedback: S(x), P(-), L(-), I(x), T(x). 
   - S(x) and I(x) and T(x) mean that S, I, T are also absent from the secret word. So now we know the secret word has none of: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, T.
   - P(-) means P is in the secret word but not in the second position (since in ""split"", P is at position 2 and we got a minus). 
   - L(-) means L is in the secret word but not in the third position (since in ""split"", L is at position 3).

So we now know:
- The secret word contains the letters P and L, but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively (and note, since the word has 5 letters, we have positions 1 to 5).
- We have eliminated the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, T. So we must avoid these.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Includes P and L (since we know they are present) but not at the wrong positions.
- Must not use any of the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, T.
- We have to cover the remaining letters to find the word.

Now, what letters are left? From the English alphabet, excluding the eliminated ones: 
Eliminated: A, C, E, I, N, R, S, T.
So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we know P and L are in the word, so we must include them. Also, the positions for P and L cannot be the same as in the previous guess? Actually, the feedback for ""split"":
- P(-) at position 2: so in the secret word, P is present but not at position 2.
- L(-) at position 3: so L is present but not at position 3.

So when we make the new word:
- P cannot be in position 2 (but can be in 1,3,4,5? Actually, we don't know which positions are allowed, except not position 2 for P and not position 3 for L).
- We must place P and L in positions where they haven't been tried and found to be absent? Actually, we haven't tested P in positions other than 2, and L in positions other than 3.

Also, note: the word must be 5 letters and a real English word.

We can try to think of words that contain both P and L, and the other letters are from the available set.

Common words: 
- ""PLUMB"" but has B? That's okay. Let's check: P, L, U, M, B. U, M, B are available? U is available? We haven't eliminated U. But note: we don't know if U is in or not. Also, positions matter.

But: P must not be at position 2. In ""split"", P was at position 2. So in the new word, if we put P at position 1?
Similarly, L was at position 3 in ""split"", so avoid L at position 3.

Let's try a word with P at the beginning? Like ""PLUMY"", but that's not common.

Alternatively, ""POLYP"" but O is available? And that repeats P? We don't know if repetition is allowed? The rules don't specify, but typically Wordle words don't have repeated letters unless they can. But for simplicity, let's assume no repetition until told otherwise? Actually, the feedback doesn't forbid it.

But in the previous feedback, we didn't have any repeated letters so let's avoid repetition for now.

Another idea: ""PLUCK"" has C and C is eliminated? So no.

How about ""GLYPH""? G, L, Y, P, H. This has P and L. And G, Y, H are available letters.

Placement: 
In ""GLYPH"": 
P is at position 5 (not 2, so okay for P). 
L is at position 2 (wasn't position 3, so not forbidden? We only know L is not at position 3, so position 2 is allowed? But we got L(-) meaning L is in the word but not at position 3. It could be at position 2? However, in ""split"", L was at 3 and was marked minus so position 3 was wrong for L. It doesn't say anything about other positions.

But wait: in the word ""split"", L was absent? No: the feedback was L(-), and minus means ""in the word but wrong position"". So L is present. Similarly, P is present.

So in ""GLYPH"": 
- P is at position 5 -> let's hope it's correct? We don't know. 
- L is at position 2 -> this is acceptable because previously L was at position 3, and now we are trying position 2.

But we need to test for other letters too.

Alternatively, we can consider other words.

Another word: ""PLUSH"" -> P, L, U, S, H. But wait: S is eliminated! We know S is absent (from guess 2: S(x)). So we cannot use S.

So avoid any eliminated letters: A, C, E, I, N, R, S, T.

So back to ""GLYPH"": it uses G, L, Y, P, H. All letters are allowed: G, Y, H haven't been tested and are available.

But note: the word ""glyph"" might be considered too obscure? But the rules didn't specify common words, but typically we use common words. Maybe we can pick a more common one.

Another word: ""HUMOR"" but has R? R is eliminated? From guess1: R(x) eliminated R.

So no.

Word: ""FLOOD"" but has O, and O is available? But then two O's? And also D available.

But it doesn't have P? We must include P because we know P is in the word.

We must include P and L.

So words containing both P and L.

Another word: ""APPLY"" has A and A is eliminated? A is from first guess, A(x) so absent.

""PLUM"": too short? 4 letters.

""PLUMB"": 5 letters: P, L, U, M, B. Available letters.

Placement: 
If we put P at 1, L at 2? But wait: P cannot be at position 2? Actually, we can put P at any position except position 2? Actually, we don't know. The feedback for P(-) means that for the guess ""split"", at position 2, P is present elsewhere. So in the secret word, P is at one of the positions: 1,3,4,5? But we haven't tried position 1 for P, so we can.

Similarly for L: it can be at 1,2,4,5? Because position 3 is wrong.

In ""PLUMB"": 
- P at position 1: possible? Yes, because we haven't tested P at position 1. 
- L at position 2: possible? Yes, because we haven't tested L at position 2? Previously L was at position 3, not 2.

So ""PLUMB"" might be acceptable? 

But let me see: 
- P in position 1? We got feedback for P that it's in the word but not at position 2, so position 1 is still allowed.
- Similarly, L in position 2 is allowed because we only know it's not at position 3.

The problem: we also eliminated U and M and B? No, we haven't. They are available.

But is ""plumb"" a common word? It might be acceptable.

Another word: ""PLUME"" but E is eliminated.

""PLANK"" has A and N, eliminated.

""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P. But I is eliminated? From guess2: I(x), so I is absent. So no.

""CLAMP"" has C and A, eliminated.

So ""PLUMB"" seems a candidate: letters P, L, U, M, B. All not eliminated.

But note: the feedback from guess2 also says that T, S, I are absent so we avoid them.

So I think ""PLUMB"" is a word we can use.

But let's think of another word without putting P and L at the first two positions? Because we are not sure if they are in those positions.

Another word: ""LUMPY"" -> L, U, M, P, Y. This has L and P. Placement: L at position 1, U at 2, M at 3, P at4, Y at5.

Now, for L: position 1 (wasn't position 3, so okay). For P: position 4 (wasn't position 2, so okay).

It also uses U, M, Y. Available letters.

Similarly, ""GUILD"" but has U, I, D? I is eliminated. So no.

""POLLY"" has O, L, L, Y? But repeated L, and O and Y are available, but no P? Wait, we don't have P? We need P.

We know P must be included, so ""POLLY"" does not have P.

""FLAPS"" has S, and eliminated? S is eliminated.

So ""LUMPY"" might be good? But we have to hope it's a word.

Similarly, ""PLUMP"" has repeated P? And M and P? But then we don't use new letters? Actually, it's valid: P, L, U, M, P. But repeated P? So we might not get information about other letters.

That might not be efficient.

Alternatively, ""OUPHE"" is not common.

I think ""PLUMB"" or ""LUMPY"" are acceptable.

But to maximize information, we want to try letters that haven't been tested. We have tested P and L, but we haven't tested U, M, B, Y, G, etc.

So ""PLUMB"" tests U, M, B in addition to P and L.

""PLUMB"" also places P and L at positions 1 and 2, which might help.

Similarly, ""BLIMP"" was eliminated because of I.

What about ""PLUNK"" has N? N is eliminated.

""FLUNG"" has F, L, U, N, G? But N is eliminated.

So hard.

Another word: ""BUMPH"" - B, U, M, P, H? Or ""BUMPY"" - B, U, M, P, Y? This has L? No it doesn't have L? We must include L.

We must include both P and L.

So words containing P and L: 
- PLUMB, LUMPY, but also ""GULPY""? Not a word.
- Or ""LYMPH"" -> L, Y, M, P, H? This has M and H? And Y? Available.

""LYMPH"": 
- Position1: L -> okay (not position 3)
- Position4: P -> okay (not position 2)
- Letters: L, Y, M, P, H -> available.

Is ""lymph"" a word? Yes, a common one.

And it avoids the eliminated letters.

In ""lymph"": 
- L at position 1: we haven't tested L at 1. 
- P at position 4: we haven't tested P at 4.

So it's a good candidate.

We can also consider ""BLYTH"" but that's not common.

I think ""lymph"" is a good choice: common word, uses L and P, and introduces Y, M, H.

But note: we cannot have L at position 3? We don't know, but we avoid position 3 for L? Actually, in this word L is at position 1 -> okay.

So I'll choose ""LYMPH"".

But let me confirm the previous feedback: 
Guess1: crane -> all x
Guess2: split -> S(x), P(-), L(-), I(x), T(x)

So yes, eliminated letters: A,C,E,I,N,R,S,T.

""LYMPH"" contains L, Y, M, P, H: 
- L: not eliminated? Not eliminated because we know it's in the word? From L(-).
- Y, M, P, H: not in eliminated list? Correct.

And P and L are placed in new positions: L at 1, P at 4.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""lymph"".After analyzing the previous feedback:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E), so none of these are in the secret word.
- ""split"" had:
  - S(x) and I(x) and T(x): S, I, T are also not in the secret word.
  - P(-): P is in the word but not in position 2.
  - L(-): L is in the word but not in position 3.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, T.
- Confirmed present letters: P and L (with P not in position 2, L not in position 3).

For the new guess:
- Must include P and L, avoiding positions revealed as wrong for each (P not pos 2, L not pos 3).
- Avoid all eliminated letters (A, C, E, I, N, R, S, T).
- Use untested common letters to maximize information (e.g., M, Y, H).

The word ""lymph"" fits:
- Contains P and L (P at position 4, not 2; L at position 1, not 3).
- Uses untested letters: Y, M, H.
- No eliminated letters.
- Valid English word.

It might be acceptable.\n\nAnother word: ""PLUME"" but E is eliminated.\n\n""PLANK"" has A and N, eliminated.\n\n""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P. But I is eliminated? From guess2: I(x), so I is absent. So no.\n\n""CLAMP"" has C and A, eliminated.\n\nSo ""PLUMB"" seems a candidate: letters P, L, U, M, B. All not eliminated.\n\nBut note: the feedback from guess2 also says that T, S, I are absent so we avoid them.\n\nSo I think ""PLUMB"" is a word we can use.\n\nBut let\'s think of another word without putting P and L at the first two positions? Because we are not sure if they are in those positions.\n\nAnother word: ""LUMPY"" -> L, U, M, P, Y. This has L and P. Placement: L at position 1, U at 2, M at 3, P at4, Y at5.\n\nNow, for L: position 1 (wasn\'t position 3, so okay). For P: position 4 (wasn\'t position 2, so okay).\n\nIt also uses U, M, Y. Available letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""GUILD"" but has U, I, D? I is eliminated. So no.\n\n""POLLY"" has O, L, L, Y? But repeated L, and O and Y are available, but no P? Wait, we don\'t have P? We need P.\n\nWe know P must be included, so ""POLLY"" does not have P.\n\n""FLAPS"" has S, and eliminated? S is eliminated.\n\nSo ""LUMPY"" might be good? But we have to hope it\'s a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""PLUMP"" has repeated P? And M and P? But then we don\'t use new letters? Actually, it\'s valid: P, L, U, M, P. But repeated P? So we might not get information about other letters.\n\nThat might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, ""OUPHE"" is not common.\n\nI think ""PLUMB"" or ""LUMPY"" are acceptable.\n\nBut to maximize information, we want to try letters that haven\'t been tested. We have tested P and L, but we haven\'t tested U, M, B, Y, G, etc.\n\nSo ""PLUMB"" tests U, M, B in addition to P and L.\n\n""PLUMB"" also places P and L at positions 1 and 2, which might help.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLIMP"" was eliminated because of I.\n\nWhat about ""PLUNK"" has N? N is eliminated.\n\n""FLUNG"" has F, L, U, N, G? But N is eliminated.\n\nSo hard.\n\nAnother word: ""BUMPH"" - B, U, M, P, H? Or ""BUMPY"" - B, U, M, P, Y? This has L? No it doesn\'t have L? We must include L.\n\nWe must include both P and L.\n\nSo words containing P and L: \n- PLUMB, LUMPY, but also ""GULPY""? Not a word.\n- Or ""LYMPH"" -> L, Y, M, P, H? This has M and H? And Y? Available.\n\n""LYMPH"": \n- Position1: L -> okay (not position 3)\n- Position4: P -> okay (not position 2)\n- Letters: L, Y, M, P, H -> available.\n\nIs ""lymph"" a word? Yes, a common one.\n\nAnd it avoids the eliminated letters.\n\nIn ""lymph"": \n- L at position 1: we haven\'t tested L at 1. \n- P at position 4: we haven\'t tested P at 4.\n\nSo it\'s a good candidate.\n\nWe can also consider ""BLYTH"" but that\'s not common.\n\nI think ""lymph"" is a good choice: common word, uses L and P, and introduces Y, M, H.\n\nBut note: we cannot have L at position 3? We don\'t know, but we avoid position 3 for L? Actually, in this word L is at position 1 -> okay.\n\nSo I\'ll choose ""LYMPH"".\n\nBut let me confirm the previous feedback: \nGuess1: crane -> all x\nGuess2: split -> S(x), P(-), L(-), I(x), T(x)\n\nSo yes, eliminated letters: A,C,E,I,N,R,S,T.\n\n""LYMPH"" contains L, Y, M, P, H: \n- L: not eliminated? Not eliminated because we know it\'s in the word? From L(-).\n- Y, M, P, H: not in eliminated list? Correct.\n\nAnd P and L are placed in new positions: L at 1, P at 4.\n\nSo it\'s a valid guess.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""lymph"".After analyzing the previous feedback:\n- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E), so none of these are in the secret word.\n- ""split"" had:\n  - S(x) and I(x) and T(x): S, I, T are also not in the secret word.\n  - P(-): P is in the word but not in position 2.\n  - L(-): L is in the word but not in position 3.\n- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, T.\n- Confirmed present letters: P and L (with P not in position 2, L not in position 3).\n\nFor the new guess:\n- Must include P and L, avoiding positions revealed as wrong for each (P not pos 2, L not pos 3).\n- Avoid all eliminated letters (A, C, E, I, N, R, S, T).\n- Use untested common letters to maximize information (e.g., M, Y, H).\n\nThe word ""lymph"" fits:\n- Contains P and L (P at position 4, not 2; L at position 1, not 3).\n- Uses untested letters: Y, M, H.\n- No eliminated letters.\n- Valid English word.\n\n<guess>lymph</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: split -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(-) L(-) I(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: lymph -> FEEDBACK: L(-) Y(x) M(-) P(-) H(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all absent: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word has none of these letters.

2. ""split"" -> 
   - S(x): absent
   - P(-): present but wrong position (not position 2)
   - L(-): present but wrong position (not position 3)
   - I(x): absent
   - T(x): absent
   So eliminated: S, I, T (in addition to the previous ones). Present: P and L.

3. ""lymph"" ->
   - L(-): present but wrong position (not position 1, because we tried L at position 1 now and it was minus)
   - Y(x): absent
   - M(-): present but wrong position (not position 3, because in ""lymph"", M is at position 3)
   - P(-): present but wrong position (not position 4, because we tried P at position 4 and it was minus)
   - H(x): absent

So now we know:
- Eliminated letters: A, C, E, I, N, R, S, T, Y, H. (from all feedback so far)
- Present letters: P, L, M (because M(-) in guess3 means M is present, and we already knew P and L are present)
- We have three confirmed letters: P, L, M.

But note: we have three letters that must be in the word: P, L, M.

Also, we have position constraints:
- P is not at position 2 (from guess2) and not at position 4 (from guess3). So P must be at position 1, 3, or 5.
- L is not at position 3 (from guess2) and not at position 1 (from guess3). So L must be at position 2, 4, or 5.
- M is not at position 3 (from guess3). So M must be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also know the word has exactly 5 letters, and we have 3 known letters (P, L, M) so we need two more letters.

The remaining available letters (from the alphabet, excluding the eliminated ones) are:
B, D, F, G, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (and note we haven't tested O, U, etc.)

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes P, L, M and two more from the available letters, and satisfies the position constraints.

Let's think of possible words.

First, note that we have three letters to place and we know they cannot be in certain positions.

Possible positions for P: 1, 3, 5
Possible positions for L: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for M: 1, 2, 4, 5

But note: the positions must be distinct.

We also need to avoid the eliminated letters.

Let me try to think of words that have P, L, M.

Common words: 
- ""CLAMP"" but C and A are eliminated.
- ""PLUMB"" but we tried that? No, we tried ""lymph"", not ""plumb"". But in ""plumb"", we have P, L, U, M, B. But U and B are available? But we haven't tried them.

But note: in the feedback for ""lymph"", we got H(x) and Y(x), so H and Y are out.

But ""plumb"" has U and B, which are available.

But we have position constraints: 
In ""plumb"": 
- P at 1 -> allowed (since P can be at 1,3,5)
- L at 2 -> allowed (L can be at 2,4,5)
- U at 3 -> not constrained? 
- M at 4 -> allowed (M can be at 1,2,4,5) but note: we have a constraint that M cannot be at position 3? Actually, in ""lymph"", M was at position 3 and we got M(-), meaning M is present but not at position 3. So position 4 is allowed for M.
- B at 5 -> not constrained.

But we have a problem: we know that L is not at position 1 (from ""lymph"" feedback: L(-) at position 1) and in ""plumb"" L is at position 2, which is allowed. Similarly, P at 1 is allowed.

But wait: we also have to consider that we haven't tested U and B. So it's a candidate.

But note: we have three known letters: P, L, M. In ""plumb"", we have P, L, U, M, B. So it includes the three and two new letters.

But we have feedback that might conflict? Not that I see.

Alternatively, we can try ""PLUMB"" as a guess? But we are on the fourth guess, so we can.

But let me see if there are other words.

Another word: ""LUMPY"" -> L, U, M, P, Y. But Y is eliminated? From guess3: Y(x) in ""lymph"", so Y is absent. So we cannot use Y.

""PLUME"" has E, eliminated.

""CLOMP"" has C and O? C is eliminated.

""BLIMP"" has I? I is eliminated.

""WHELP"" has W, H, E? H and E are eliminated.

""GUMPTION"" too long.

""PLUM"" is 4 letters.

""GLUMP"" not a word.

""FLUMP"" not common.

""PLUMP"" has P twice? But we don't know if the word has repeated letters. But to be safe, let's avoid for now.

Another word: ""DUMPY"" has Y, eliminated.

""JUMPY"" has Y and J? Y eliminated.

""MOULD"" has O, U, L, D? But no P? We need P.

We must have P.

""POLYP"" has O, L, Y, P? Y eliminated and repeated P? Not good.

""PILOT"" has I and O? I eliminated.

So ""PLUMB"" seems a good candidate.

But let me check the position constraints for ""PLUMB"":
- P at 1: allowed (since not 2 or 4)
- L at 2: allowed (since not 1 or 3)
- U at 3: no constraint
- M at 4: allowed (since not 3)
- B at 5: no constraint

But we have a constraint for M: it cannot be at position 3, and in this word it's at 4, which is fine.

But note: we also have a constraint for L: it cannot be at position 3, and in this word it's at 2, which is fine.

And for P: not at 2 or 4, and at 1 is fine.

So ""PLUMB"" is a valid guess.

But we already have three letters confirmed: P, L, M. And we are introducing U and B.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put P at 1? Because we haven't tried P at 3 or 5.

But ""PLUMB"" is a common word and fits.

Another word: ""PLUMB"" is acceptable.

But note: we have to consider that we might have more information.

We also know that M is not at position 3, but we are putting it at 4.

Similarly, we haven't tested U and B.

So I think ""PLUMB"" is a good guess.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters? U and B are not the most common, but we don't have many options.

Another word: ""OPIUM"" has O, P, I, U, M? I is eliminated.

""PULMO"" not a word.

""LUMPS"" has S, eliminated.

""LOPPY"" has O, P, P, Y? Y eliminated and repeated P.

So I think ""PLUMB"" is the best.

But wait: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong? We are not.

So I'll go with ""PLUMB"".

But note: in the feedback for ""lymph"", we had L at position 1 and it was minus, meaning L is not at position 1. In ""PLUMB"", we put L at position 2, which is a new position and allowed.

Similarly, P at position 1: we haven't tested P at position 1 before? In ""split"", P was at position 2 and we got minus. In ""lymph"", P was at position 4 and we got minus. So position 1 is untested for P and allowed.

So let's guess ""PLUMB"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Eliminated letters**: A, C, E, H, I, N, R, S, T, Y (all marked ""x"" in guesses 1–3).
- **Confirmed present letters**: P, L, M (all marked ""-"" in guesses 2–3, meaning they are in the word but not in the positions tested).
- **Position constraints**:
  - P cannot be in position 2 (from ""split"") or position 4 (from ""lymph""), so P must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
  - L cannot be in position 1 (from ""lymph"") or position 3 (from ""split""), so L must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
  - M cannot be in position 3 (from ""lymph""), so M must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (since all other letters are eliminated).

For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes P, L, and M (since they are confirmed present).
- Uses only available letters (no eliminated letters).
- Respects the position constraints for P, L, and M.
- Maximizes information by testing new positions and letters.

After evaluating possible words, **""plumb""** fits all criteria:
- Contains P, L, M (required letters).
- Uses new letters U and B (both untested and available).
- Position placement:
  - P at position 1: Allowed (P can be at 1, 3, or 5; position 1 is untested).
  - L at position 2: Allowed (L can be at 2, 4, or 5; position 2 is untested).
  - M at position 4: Allowed (M can be at 1, 2, 4, or 5; position 4 is untested and avoids position 3).
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

This guess tests P at position 1, L at position 2, and M at position 4 while introducing U and B, which could help identify the full word if incorrect.

<guess>plumb</guess>",plumb,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all absent: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word has none of these letters.

2. ""split"" -> 
   - S(x): absent
   - P(-): present but wrong position (not position 2)
   - L(-): present but wrong position (not position 3)
   - I(x): absent
   - T(x): absent
   So eliminated: S, I, T (in addition to the previous ones). Present: P and L.

3. ""lymph"" ->
   - L(-): present but wrong position (not position 1, because we tried L at position 1 now and it was minus)
   - Y(x): absent
   - M(-): present but wrong position (not position 3, because in ""lymph"", M is at position 3)
   - P(-): present but wrong position (not position 4, because we tried P at position 4 and it was minus)
   - H(x): absent

So now we know:
- Eliminated letters: A, C, E, I, N, R, S, T, Y, H. (from all feedback so far)
- Present letters: P, L, M (because M(-) in guess3 means M is present, and we already knew P and L are present)
- We have three confirmed letters: P, L, M.

But note: we have three letters that must be in the word: P, L, M.

Also, we have position constraints:
- P is not at position 2 (from guess2) and not at position 4 (from guess3). So P must be at position 1, 3, or 5.
- L is not at position 3 (from guess2) and not at position 1 (from guess3). So L must be at position 2, 4, or 5.
- M is not at position 3 (from guess3). So M must be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also know the word has exactly 5 letters, and we have 3 known letters (P, L, M) so we need two more letters.

The remaining available letters (from the alphabet, excluding the eliminated ones) are:
B, D, F, G, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (and note we haven't tested O, U, etc.)

- ""PLUMB"" but we tried that? No, we tried ""lymph"", not ""plumb"". But in ""plumb"", we have P, L, U, M, B. But U and B are available? But we haven't tried them.

But note: in the feedback for ""lymph"", we got H(x) and Y(x), so H and Y are out.

But ""plumb"" has U and B, which are available.

In ""plumb"": 
- P at 1 -> allowed (since P can be at 1,3,5)
- L at 2 -> allowed (L can be at 2,4,5)
- U at 3 -> not constrained? 
- M at 4 -> allowed (M can be at 1,2,4,5) but note: we have a constraint that M cannot be at position 3? Actually, in ""lymph"", M was at position 3 and we got M(-), meaning M is present but not at position 3. So position 4 is allowed for M.
- B at 5 -> not constrained.

But we have a problem: we know that L is not at position 1 (from ""lymph"" feedback: L(-) at position 1) and in ""plumb"" L is at position 2, which is allowed. Similarly, P at 1 is allowed.

But wait: we also have to consider that we haven't tested U and B. So it's a candidate.

- P at 1: allowed (since not 2 or 4)
- L at 2: allowed (since not 1 or 3)
- U at 3: no constraint
- M at 4: allowed (since not 3)
- B at 5: no constraint

But we have a constraint for M: it cannot be at position 3, and in this word it's at 4, which is fine.

But note: we also have a constraint for L: it cannot be at position 3, and in this word it's at 2, which is fine.

And for P: not at 2 or 4, and at 1 is fine.

So ""PLUMB"" is a valid guess.

So let's guess ""PLUMB"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Eliminated letters**: A, C, E, H, I, N, R, S, T, Y (all marked ""x"" in guesses 1–3).
- **Confirmed present letters**: P, L, M (all marked ""-"" in guesses 2–3, meaning they are in the word but not in the positions tested).
- **Position constraints**:
  - P cannot be in position 2 (from ""split"") or position 4 (from ""lymph""), so P must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
  - L cannot be in position 1 (from ""lymph"") or position 3 (from ""split""), so L must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
  - M cannot be in position 3 (from ""lymph""), so M must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
