We are starting the game. We need to pick a good starting word.
 Ideal starting words have common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TARES"", ""ROATE"", ""RAISE"", etc.
 Since we have no prior feedback, we choose a word that uses frequent letters in the English language.
 I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (R, S) and includes the vowel I, which is also common.

 Let me verify that ""RAISE"" is a valid 5-letter English word: yes, it is.

A good starting word typically:
- Contains frequent vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
- Avoids repeated letters
- Has letters in positions where they commonly appear

Based on common Wordle strategies, words like ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are strong openers. I'll select ""RAISE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) which are among the most common in English
- Features common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing coverage
- The word is a valid English term

This guess will provide valuable feedback about the presence and positions of these letters.

We have feedback from the first guess: RAISE -> all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters R, A, I, S, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Since none of these letters are present, we need to choose a word that uses entirely different letters.
 We have 21 consonants and 5 vowels left, but we should try to cover more common letters that haven't been tried.

 Common letters not used: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

 We should pick a word that uses as many of the remaining common letters as possible.

 Some common starting words without R, A, I, S, E:
 - ""CLOUT""
 - ""NYMPH""
 - ""POUND""
 - ""THUMB""

 However, we also want to cover vowels. The remaining vowels are O, U (since A, E, I are out). Note: Y can sometimes be a vowel.

 Let's think of words that include O and U, and common consonants.

 Good candidate: ""POUND"" -> P, O, U, N, D. This covers O and U (vowels) and common consonants P, N, D.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can also consider other words.

 Another candidate: ""THONG"" -> T, H, O, N, G. This has O and common consonants.

 However, we want to maximize new letters. Since we have no information, we should avoid letters that are less common.

 Let's list the frequency of remaining letters in English words (5-letter words):

 According to English letter frequency, after removing R, A, I, S, E, the next most common are:
 T, O, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, Y, F, V, K, W, X, Z, Q, J.

 We should try to cover T, O, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H.

 We can't cover all in two guesses, but we can cover 5.

 A word that uses T, O, U, N, and P? ""POUTY"" but that has Y and we don't know if Y is in the word. Also, ""POUTY"" is not very common.

 Alternatively, ""COUNT"" -> C, O, U, N, T. This covers T, O, U, N, and C. All common.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, I, S, E. ""COUNT"" does not use any of these.

 Let me check if ""COUNT"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

 Another option: ""DONUT"" but that is not a standard word? Actually, ""DONUT"" is accepted in some dictionaries, but ""COUNT"" is better.

 Another common word: ""MOUTH"" -> M, O, U, T, H. This covers M, O, U, T, H.

 We can also consider ""YOUTH"" but that has Y and we already have T and H.

 However, since we have no vowels left except O and U (and sometimes Y), we should use both O and U.

 I think ""COUNT"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and U) and three common consonants (C, N, T).

 Alternatively, ""POUND"" is also good because it has O, U and P, N, D.

 But note: we want to get as much information as possible. The position of vowels might be important.

 Since the secret word has none of R, A, I, S, E, it must use other vowels (O, U, and sometimes Y) or no vowels? But every word has at least one vowel.

 So, we must include at least one vowel (O or U) or Y acting as a vowel.

 Let's choose ""COUNT"".

 However, we must be cautious: if the word has a Y, we haven't tested it. But we can test that later.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can cover Y in a later guess if needed.

 Therefore, I choose ""COUNT"" as the next guess.

 But wait: what if the word has a double letter? We don't know. But ""COUNT"" has no double letters.

 Alternatively, we can use ""LYMPH"" but that has Y and H, and L, M, P. But it has no O or U. It might be that the word has Y as a vowel? But we don't know.

 Given the feedback, we know the word has no R, A, I, S, E. So it must have at least one of O, U, or Y (as vowel).

 We should cover both O and U in one guess? Yes, if possible.

 ""COUNT"" has O and U. So that's good.

 Let me check: C, O, U, N, T.

 We haven't used any of these.

 So, we'll guess ""COUNT"".

 Response format: 
 <thinking>
 We have eliminated R, A, I, S, E. The next guess must avoid these letters and use new ones. 
 We choose ""COUNT"" because it includes two vowels (O and U) and three common consonants (C, N, T) that haven't been tried.
 This will give us information about these letters and their positions.
 </thinking>
</think>
<thinking>
The previous feedback for ""RAISE"" showed that none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are in the secret word. This means the secret word contains only letters from the remaining 21 consonants and vowels (excluding A, E, I). 

Key insights:
- The secret word must use other vowels (O, U, or sometimes Y) since all English words have vowels.
- High-frequency consonants not yet tested include T, N, L, C, O, U, D, P, M, H, G, B.
- An optimal second guess should maximize coverage of these untested common letters and include at least one vowel (O/U).

After evaluating options:
- ""COUNT"" is chosen because it:
  - Uses 5 new, high-frequency letters (C, O, U, N, T).
  - Covers two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants.
  - Avoids redundancy (no repeated letters).
  - Is a valid English word.

 We choose ""COUNT"" because it includes two vowels (O and U) and three common consonants (C, N, T) that haven't been tried.
 This will give us information about these letters and their positions.
 </thinking><thinking>
The previous feedback for ""RAISE"" showed that none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are in the secret word. This means the secret word contains only letters from the remaining 21 consonants and vowels (excluding A, E, I). 

Key insights:
- The secret word must use other vowels (O, U, or sometimes Y) since all English words have vowels.
- High-frequency consonants not yet tested include T, N, L, C, O, U, D, P, M, H, G, B.
- An optimal second guess should maximize coverage of these untested common letters and include at least one vowel (O/U).

After evaluating options:
- ""COUNT"" is chosen because it:
  - Uses 5 new, high-frequency letters (C, O, U, N, T).
  - Covers two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants.
  - Avoids redundancy (no repeated letters).
  - Is a valid English word.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. RAISE: all letters are absent (x) -> so the secret word has none of R, A, I, S, E.
2. COUNT: 
   - C: absent (x)
   - O: correct (✓) and in the correct position (position 2, since COUNT is C-O-U-N-T, so O is the second letter)
   - U: absent (x)
   - N: absent (x)
   - T: absent (x)

So, from COUNT, we know:
- The second letter of the secret word is O.
- The letters C, U, N, T are not in the word.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has O as the second letter.
- The secret word does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T.

We have eliminated 10 letters: R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has O as the second letter.
- Uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the 10 eliminated letters).
- Tries to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: the word must have vowels. We have eliminated A, E, I, U. The only vowel left is O (which we know is in the word) and sometimes Y (which can be a vowel). So the word might have Y as a vowel, or it might have only O as the vowel (like in some words).

We know the second letter is O, so the word is of the form: _ O _ _ _

We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only the remaining letters.

Common letters from the remaining set: L, M, P, D, G, B, H, Y, etc.

We should try to include Y because it might be the only vowel candidate left.

Possible words:
- Words with second letter O and using only the remaining letters.

Let's brainstorm:
- B O _ _ _ : possible words: BOGUS (but U and S are eliminated) -> invalid.
  Other: BOGGY? But G is allowed, but Y is allowed. But BOGGY has double G? Let's see: B O G G Y -> but we have two G's? We don't know if double letters are allowed, but in Wordle they can be. However, we haven't seen any double letters yet, but it's possible.

But we must avoid eliminated letters.

Eliminated: R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T.

So for B O _ _ _:
- B O L L Y -> BOLLY? Not common. BOXED? But X and E are eliminated? E is eliminated, so no.
- B O D Y _ -> BODY? But that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters: BODED? But E and D? E is eliminated. BODDY? Not a word.

Perhaps try other starting letters.

How about G O _ _ _:
- G O L D _ -> GOLDY? Not a word. GOLDS? But S is eliminated. GOLD is 4 letters.
- G O B L Y -> GOBLY? Not a word.
- G O O D Y -> GOODY: G, O, O, D, Y. But O is repeated? We don't know if repetition is allowed. But in this case, we know O is in the word, but it might be repeated? The feedback for COUNT only showed one O and it was correct, but there could be another O? However, in COUNT, we had O in the second position and if there was another O, it might have been marked as present but in wrong position? But in COUNT, we only had one O and it was correct, so if there is another O, it would have been marked as present? But the feedback for O was only for the second position and it was correct, and the other positions didn't have O, so we don't know if there is another O. But in the feedback, for the other positions, we don't have O, so if there was a second O, it might not have been revealed because we didn't guess it in another position? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, and you guess it once in a position, and it is correct, then if there is another one, it might be shown as present if you guess it in a wrong position. But in COUNT, we only guessed one O, and it was correct, so if there is a second O, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess it. So we have to consider the possibility of double letters.

But to be safe, we should avoid assuming double letters for now.

So, for G O _ _ _: 
- G O L D Y? Not 5 letters.
- G O A D S? But A and S are eliminated.
- G O B B Y? G O B B Y -> GOBY is a word? Goby is 4 letters. Gobby? Not common.

Try M O _ _ _:
- M O D E L? But E and L? E is eliminated.
- M O L L Y -> MOLLY: M, O, L, L, Y. This uses M, O, L, Y. L is repeated? But we can try. MOLLY is a valid word.

But we have two L's? We don't know if L is in the word or not.

Another: M O T H Y? But T is eliminated.

M O P P Y -> MOPPY: M, O, P, P, Y. P repeated? MOPPY is a word? It means resembling mop, but not common.

M O H A W K? But A is eliminated.

Try P O _ _ _:
- P O L K Y -> POLKY? Not a word.
- P O D G Y -> PODGY: P, O, D, G, Y. This seems good. PODGY is a valid English word meaning slightly fat. And it uses P, O, D, G, Y. All letters are in the remaining set.

Check: P, O, D, G, Y. 
- O is in the second position, which we know is correct.
- P, D, G, Y are new letters.

Also, it has Y, which might be a vowel.

Another option: H O _ _ _
- H O D G Y? HODGY? Not a word.
- H O P P Y -> HOPPY: H, O, P, P, Y. P repeated? HOPPY is a word (like beer).
- H O L M Y? Not a word.

B O _ _ _: B O G G Y -> BOGGY: B, O, G, G, Y. G repeated? BOGGY is a word (meaning marshy).

But we have two G's? We don't know.

F O _ _ _: F O G G Y -> FOGGY: F, O, G, G, Y. Again, double G.

D O _ _ _: D O L L Y -> DOLLY: D, O, L, L, Y. Double L.

Y O _ _ _: Y O G I C? But I is eliminated. Y O U T H? But U and T are eliminated.

So, we have a few candidates: 
- PODGY: P, O, D, G, Y (no repeats)
- MOLLY: M, O, L, L, Y (double L)
- HOPPY: H, O, P, P, Y (double P)
- BOGGY: B, O, G, G, Y (double G)
- FOGGY: F, O, G, G, Y (double G)

PODGY has no repeated letters, so it might be better for getting more information.

Also, PODGY uses four new letters: P, D, G, Y.

We can also consider other words without Y? But we need vowels, and Y is the only candidate left besides O.

Another word: W O L V E? But E is eliminated.

Or P O X Y? But X and Y? POXY is 4 letters.

So, PODGY seems a good choice.

But let's confirm: PODGY is a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

We know the second letter is O, so in PODGY, the O is in the second position, which is correct.

So, we'll guess PODGY.

But note: in PODGY, the O is the second letter, so we expect that to be correct. The other letters: P, D, G, Y are all new.

We might get some feedback on these.

Alternatively, if we are concerned about double letters, we can avoid them and go with PODGY.

So, I choose PODGY.

Response format:
<thinking>
We know the second letter is O and the word contains none of R,A,I,S,E,C,U,N,T. 
We choose ""PODGY"" because it has O in the correct second position and introduces four new common letters (P, D, G, Y) without any repeats. 
This maximizes information gain about the remaining letter possibilities.

The previous feedback reveals:
- The secret word has 'O' in the second position (from COUNT: O(✓)).
- The secret word contains **none** of these letters: R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T (all marked absent in previous guesses).

Given this:
- The word must be of the form: _ O _ _ _
- Only unused letters are available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Since common vowels A, E, I, U are eliminated, the word likely uses 'O' as its primary vowel, with 'Y' as a possible secondary vowel candidate.

Strategy for the next guess:
- Prioritize words with 'O' in position 2 and unused high-frequency consonants (e.g., L, M, P, D, G, H, Y).
- Avoid eliminated letters and minimize letter repetition to maximize information gain.
- ""PODGY"" fits perfectly: 
  - Confirms the known 'O' in position 2.
  - Tests four new common letters (P, D, G, Y).
  - No repeated letters, increasing coverage.
  - Valid English word (meaning ""slightly fat"").

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to pick a good starting word.
 Ideal starting words have common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TARES"", ""ROATE"", ""RAISE"", etc.
 Since we have no prior feedback, we choose a word that uses frequent letters in the English language.
 I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (R, S) and includes the vowel I, which is also common.

 Let me verify that ""RAISE"" is a valid 5-letter English word: yes, it is.

 Therefore, for the first guess, I choose ""RAISE"".

 Response format:
 <guess>RAISE</guess><thinking>
I'm starting a new game of Wordle. Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. I need to choose a strategic starting word that covers common letters and positions.

A good starting word typically:
- Contains frequent vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
- Avoids repeated letters
- Has letters in positions where they commonly appear

Based on common Wordle strategies, words like ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are strong openers. I'll select ""RAISE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) which are among the most common in English
- Features common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing coverage
- The word is a valid English term

This guess will provide valuable feedback about the presence and positions of these letters.
</thinking>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: RAISE -> all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters R, A, I, S, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Since none of these letters are present, we need to choose a word that uses entirely different letters.
 We have 21 consonants and 5 vowels left, but we should try to cover more common letters that haven't been tried.

 Common letters not used: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

 We should pick a word that uses as many of the remaining common letters as possible.

 Some common starting words without R, A, I, S, E:
 - ""CLOUT""
 - ""NYMPH""
 - ""POUND""
 - ""THUMB""

 However, we also want to cover vowels. The remaining vowels are O, U (since A, E, I are out). Note: Y can sometimes be a vowel.

 Let's think of words that include O and U, and common consonants.

 Good candidate: ""POUND"" -> P, O, U, N, D. This covers O and U (vowels) and common consonants P, N, D.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can also consider other words.

 Another candidate: ""THONG"" -> T, H, O, N, G. This has O and common consonants.

 However, we want to maximize new letters. Since we have no information, we should avoid letters that are less common.

 Let's list the frequency of remaining letters in English words (5-letter words):

 According to English letter frequency, after removing R, A, I, S, E, the next most common are:
 T, O, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, Y, F, V, K, W, X, Z, Q, J.

 We should try to cover T, O, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H.

 We can't cover all in two guesses, but we can cover 5.

 A word that uses T, O, U, N, and P? ""POUTY"" but that has Y and we don't know if Y is in the word. Also, ""POUTY"" is not very common.

 Alternatively, ""COUNT"" -> C, O, U, N, T. This covers T, O, U, N, and C. All common.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, I, S, E. ""COUNT"" does not use any of these.

 Let me check if ""COUNT"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

 Another option: ""DONUT"" but that is not a standard word? Actually, ""DONUT"" is accepted in some dictionaries, but ""COUNT"" is better.

 Another common word: ""MOUTH"" -> M, O, U, T, H. This covers M, O, U, T, H.

 We can also consider ""YOUTH"" but that has Y and we already have T and H.

 However, since we have no vowels left except O and U (and sometimes Y), we should use both O and U.

 I think ""COUNT"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and U) and three common consonants (C, N, T).

 Alternatively, ""POUND"" is also good because it has O, U and P, N, D.

 But note: we want to get as much information as possible. The position of vowels might be important.

 Since the secret word has none of R, A, I, S, E, it must use other vowels (O, U, and sometimes Y) or no vowels? But every word has at least one vowel.

 So, we must include at least one vowel (O or U) or Y acting as a vowel.

 Let's choose ""COUNT"".

 However, we must be cautious: if the word has a Y, we haven't tested it. But we can test that later.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can cover Y in a later guess if needed.

 Therefore, I choose ""COUNT"" as the next guess.

 But wait: what if the word has a double letter? We don't know. But ""COUNT"" has no double letters.

 Alternatively, we can use ""LYMPH"" but that has Y and H, and L, M, P. But it has no O or U. It might be that the word has Y as a vowel? But we don't know.

 Given the feedback, we know the word has no R, A, I, S, E. So it must have at least one of O, U, or Y (as vowel).

 We should cover both O and U in one guess? Yes, if possible.

 ""COUNT"" has O and U. So that's good.

 Let me check: C, O, U, N, T.

 We haven't used any of these.

 So, we'll guess ""COUNT"".

 Response format: 
 <thinking>
 We have eliminated R, A, I, S, E. The next guess must avoid these letters and use new ones. 
 We choose ""COUNT"" because it includes two vowels (O and U) and three common consonants (C, N, T) that haven't been tried.
 This will give us information about these letters and their positions.
 </thinking><thinking>
The previous feedback for ""RAISE"" showed that none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are in the secret word. This means the secret word contains only letters from the remaining 21 consonants and vowels (excluding A, E, I). 

Key insights:
- The secret word must use other vowels (O, U, or sometimes Y) since all English words have vowels.
- High-frequency consonants not yet tested include T, N, L, C, O, U, D, P, M, H, G, B.
- An optimal second guess should maximize coverage of these untested common letters and include at least one vowel (O/U).

After evaluating options:
- ""COUNT"" is chosen because it:
  - Uses 5 new, high-frequency letters (C, O, U, N, T).
  - Covers two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants.
  - Avoids redundancy (no repeated letters).
  - Is a valid English word.
</thinking>

<guess>COUNT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. RAISE: all letters are absent (x) -> so the secret word has none of R, A, I, S, E.
2. COUNT: 
   - C: absent (x)
   - O: correct (✓) and in the correct position (position 2, since COUNT is C-O-U-N-T, so O is the second letter)
   - U: absent (x)
   - N: absent (x)
   - T: absent (x)

So, from COUNT, we know:
- The second letter of the secret word is O.
- The letters C, U, N, T are not in the word.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has O as the second letter.
- The secret word does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T.

We have eliminated 10 letters: R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has O as the second letter.
- Uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the 10 eliminated letters).
- Tries to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: the word must have vowels. We have eliminated A, E, I, U. The only vowel left is O (which we know is in the word) and sometimes Y (which can be a vowel). So the word might have Y as a vowel, or it might have only O as the vowel (like in some words).

We know the second letter is O, so the word is of the form: _ O _ _ _

We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only the remaining letters.

Common letters from the remaining set: L, M, P, D, G, B, H, Y, etc.

We should try to include Y because it might be the only vowel candidate left.

Possible words:
- Words with second letter O and using only the remaining letters.

Let's brainstorm:
- B O _ _ _ : possible words: BOGUS (but U and S are eliminated) -> invalid.
  Other: BOGGY? But G is allowed, but Y is allowed. But BOGGY has double G? Let's see: B O G G Y -> but we have two G's? We don't know if double letters are allowed, but in Wordle they can be. However, we haven't seen any double letters yet, but it's possible.

But we must avoid eliminated letters.

Eliminated: R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T.

So for B O _ _ _:
- B O L L Y -> BOLLY? Not common. BOXED? But X and E are eliminated? E is eliminated, so no.
- B O D Y _ -> BODY? But that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters: BODED? But E and D? E is eliminated. BODDY? Not a word.

Perhaps try other starting letters.

How about G O _ _ _:
- G O L D _ -> GOLDY? Not a word. GOLDS? But S is eliminated. GOLD is 4 letters.
- G O B L Y -> GOBLY? Not a word.
- G O O D Y -> GOODY: G, O, O, D, Y. But O is repeated? We don't know if repetition is allowed. But in this case, we know O is in the word, but it might be repeated? The feedback for COUNT only showed one O and it was correct, but there could be another O? However, in COUNT, we had O in the second position and if there was another O, it might have been marked as present but in wrong position? But in COUNT, we only had one O and it was correct, so if there is another O, it would have been marked as present? But the feedback for O was only for the second position and it was correct, and the other positions didn't have O, so we don't know if there is another O. But in the feedback, for the other positions, we don't have O, so if there was a second O, it might not have been revealed because we didn't guess it in another position? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, and you guess it once in a position, and it is correct, then if there is another one, it might be shown as present if you guess it in a wrong position. But in COUNT, we only guessed one O, and it was correct, so if there is a second O, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess it. So we have to consider the possibility of double letters.

But to be safe, we should avoid assuming double letters for now.

So, for G O _ _ _: 
- G O L D Y? Not 5 letters.
- G O A D S? But A and S are eliminated.
- G O B B Y? G O B B Y -> GOBY is a word? Goby is 4 letters. Gobby? Not common.

Try M O _ _ _:
- M O D E L? But E and L? E is eliminated.
- M O L L Y -> MOLLY: M, O, L, L, Y. This uses M, O, L, Y. L is repeated? But we can try. MOLLY is a valid word.

But we have two L's? We don't know if L is in the word or not.

Another: M O T H Y? But T is eliminated.

M O P P Y -> MOPPY: M, O, P, P, Y. P repeated? MOPPY is a word? It means resembling mop, but not common.

M O H A W K? But A is eliminated.

Try P O _ _ _:
- P O L K Y -> POLKY? Not a word.
- P O D G Y -> PODGY: P, O, D, G, Y. This seems good. PODGY is a valid English word meaning slightly fat. And it uses P, O, D, G, Y. All letters are in the remaining set.

Check: P, O, D, G, Y. 
- O is in the second position, which we know is correct.
- P, D, G, Y are new letters.

Also, it has Y, which might be a vowel.

Another option: H O _ _ _
- H O D G Y? HODGY? Not a word.
- H O P P Y -> HOPPY: H, O, P, P, Y. P repeated? HOPPY is a word (like beer).
- H O L M Y? Not a word.

B O _ _ _: B O G G Y -> BOGGY: B, O, G, G, Y. G repeated? BOGGY is a word (meaning marshy).

But we have two G's? We don't know.

F O _ _ _: F O G G Y -> FOGGY: F, O, G, G, Y. Again, double G.

D O _ _ _: D O L L Y -> DOLLY: D, O, L, L, Y. Double L.

Y O _ _ _: Y O G I C? But I is eliminated. Y O U T H? But U and T are eliminated.

So, we have a few candidates: 
- PODGY: P, O, D, G, Y (no repeats)
- MOLLY: M, O, L, L, Y (double L)
- HOPPY: H, O, P, P, Y (double P)
- BOGGY: B, O, G, G, Y (double G)
- FOGGY: F, O, G, G, Y (double G)

PODGY has no repeated letters, so it might be better for getting more information.

Also, PODGY uses four new letters: P, D, G, Y.

We can also consider other words without Y? But we need vowels, and Y is the only candidate left besides O.

Another word: W O L V E? But E is eliminated.

Or P O X Y? But X and Y? POXY is 4 letters.

So, PODGY seems a good choice.

But let's confirm: PODGY is a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

We know the second letter is O, so in PODGY, the O is in the second position, which is correct.

So, we'll guess PODGY.

But note: in PODGY, the O is the second letter, so we expect that to be correct. The other letters: P, D, G, Y are all new.

We might get some feedback on these.

Alternatively, if we are concerned about double letters, we can avoid them and go with PODGY.

So, I choose PODGY.

Response format:
<thinking>
We know the second letter is O and the word contains none of R,A,I,S,E,C,U,N,T. 
We choose ""PODGY"" because it has O in the correct second position and introduces four new common letters (P, D, G, Y) without any repeats. 
This maximizes information gain about the remaining letter possibilities.
</thinking>
<guess>PODGY</guess><thinking>
The previous feedback reveals:
- The secret word has 'O' in the second position (from COUNT: O(✓)).
- The secret word contains **none** of these letters: R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T (all marked absent in previous guesses).

Given this:
- The word must be of the form: _ O _ _ _
- Only unused letters are available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Since common vowels A, E, I, U are eliminated, the word likely uses 'O' as its primary vowel, with 'Y' as a possible secondary vowel candidate.

Strategy for the next guess:
- Prioritize words with 'O' in position 2 and unused high-frequency consonants (e.g., L, M, P, D, G, H, Y).
- Avoid eliminated letters and minimize letter repetition to maximize information gain.
- ""PODGY"" fits perfectly: 
  - Confirms the known 'O' in position 2.
  - Tests four new common letters (P, D, G, Y).
  - No repeated letters, increasing coverage.
  - Valid English word (meaning ""slightly fat"").

Not a word.\n\nPerhaps try other starting letters.\n\nHow about G O _ _ _:\n- G O L D _ -> GOLDY? Not a word. GOLDS? But S is eliminated. GOLD is 4 letters.\n- G O B L Y -> GOBLY? Not a word.\n- G O O D Y -> GOODY: G, O, O, D, Y. But O is repeated? We don\'t know if repetition is allowed. But in this case, we know O is in the word, but it might be repeated? The feedback for COUNT only showed one O and it was correct, but there could be another O? However, in COUNT, we had O in the second position and if there was another O, it might have been marked as present but in wrong position? But in COUNT, we only had one O and it was correct, so if there is another O, it would have been marked as present? But the feedback for O was only for the second position and it was correct, and the other positions didn\'t have O, so we don\'t know if there is another O. But in the feedback, for the other positions, we don\'t have O, so if there was a second O, it might not have been revealed because we didn\'t guess it in another position? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, and you guess it once in a position, and it is correct, then if there is another one, it might be shown as present if you guess it in a wrong position. But in COUNT, we only guessed one O, and it was correct, so if there is a second O, we wouldn\'t know because we didn\'t guess it. So we have to consider the possibility of double letters.\n\nBut to be safe, we should avoid assuming double letters for now.\n\nSo, for G O _ _ _: \n- G O L D Y? Not 5 letters.\n- G O A D S? But A and S are eliminated.\n- G O B B Y? G O B B Y -> GOBY is a word? Goby is 4 letters. Gobby? Not common.\n\nTry M O _ _ _:\n- M O D E L? But E and L? E is eliminated.\n- M O L L Y -> MOLLY: M, O, L, L, Y. This uses M, O, L, Y. L is repeated? But we can try. MOLLY is a valid word.\n\nBut we have two L\'s? We don\'t know if L is in the word or not.\n\nAnother: M O T H Y? But T is eliminated.\n\nM O P P Y -> MOPPY: M, O, P, P, Y. P repeated? MOPPY is a word? It means resembling mop, but not common.\n\nM O H A W K? But A is eliminated.\n\nTry P O _ _ _:\n- P O L K Y -> POLKY? Not a word.\n- P O D G Y -> PODGY: P, O, D, G, Y. This seems good. PODGY is a valid English word meaning slightly fat. And it uses P, O, D, G, Y. All letters are in the remaining set.\n\nCheck: P, O, D, G, Y. \n- O is in the second position, which we know is correct.\n- P, D, G, Y are new letters.\n\nAlso, it has Y, which might be a vowel.\n\nAnother option: H O _ _ _\n- H O D G Y? HODGY? Not a word.\n- H O P P Y -> HOPPY: H, O, P, P, Y. P repeated? HOPPY is a word (like beer).\n- H O L M Y? Not a word.\n\nB O _ _ _: B O G G Y -> BOGGY: B, O, G, G, Y. G repeated? BOGGY is a word (meaning marshy).\n\nBut we have two G\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nF O _ _ _: F O G G Y -> FOGGY: F, O, G, G, Y. Again, double G.\n\nD O _ _ _: D O L L Y -> DOLLY: D, O, L, L, Y. Double L.\n\nY O _ _ _: Y O G I C? But I is eliminated. Y O U T H? But U and T are eliminated.\n\nSo, we have a few candidates: \n- PODGY: P, O, D, G, Y (no repeats)\n- MOLLY: M, O, L, L, Y (double L)\n- HOPPY: H, O, P, P, Y (double P)\n- BOGGY: B, O, G, G, Y (double G)\n- FOGGY: F, O, G, G, Y (double G)\n\nPODGY has no repeated letters, so it might be better for getting more information.\n\nAlso, PODGY uses four new letters: P, D, G, Y.\n\nWe can also consider other words without Y? But we need vowels, and Y is the only candidate left besides O.\n\nAnother word: W O L V E? But E is eliminated.\n\nOr P O X Y? But X and Y? POXY is 4 letters.\n\nSo, PODGY seems a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: PODGY is a valid 5-letter word? Yes.\n\nWe know the second letter is O, so in PODGY, the O is in the second position, which is correct.\n\nSo, we\'ll guess PODGY.\n\nBut note: in PODGY, the O is the second letter, so we expect that to be correct. The other letters: P, D, G, Y are all new.\n\nWe might get some feedback on these.\n\nAlternatively, if we are concerned about double letters, we can avoid them and go with PODGY.\n\nSo, I choose PODGY.\n\nResponse format:\n<thinking>\nWe know the second letter is O and the word contains none of R,A,I,S,E,C,U,N,T. \nWe choose ""PODGY"" because it has O in the correct second position and introduces four new common letters (P, D, G, Y) without any repeats. \nThis maximizes information gain about the remaining letter possibilities.\n</thinking>\n<guess>PODGY</guess><thinking>\nThe previous feedback reveals:\n- The secret word has \'O\' in the second position (from COUNT: O(✓)).\n- The secret word contains **none** of these letters: R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T (all marked absent in previous guesses).\n\nGiven this:\n- The word must be of the form: _ O _ _ _\n- Only unused letters are available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- Since common vowels A, E, I, U are eliminated, the word likely uses \'O\' as its primary vowel, with \'Y\' as a possible secondary vowel candidate.\n\nStrategy for the next guess:\n- Prioritize words with \'O\' in position 2 and unused high-frequency consonants (e.g., L, M, P, D, G, H, Y).\n- Avoid eliminated letters and minimize letter repetition to maximize information gain.\n- ""PODGY"" fits perfectly: \n  - Confirms the known \'O\' in position 2.\n  - Tests four new common letters (P, D, G, Y).\n  - No repeated letters, increasing coverage.\n  - Valid English word (meaning ""slightly fat"").\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>PODGY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: PODGY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) D(✓) G(-) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the third guess: PODGY -> P(x) O(✓) D(✓) G(-) Y(✓)
 Let's break this down:
 - P: absent (x) → P is not in the word at all.
 - O: correct (✓) and in position 2 (as we knew, but confirmed).
 - D: correct (✓) and in position 3? PODGY is P-O-D-G-Y, so D is the third letter. So D is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 3).
 - G: present but wrong position (-) → G is in the word, but not in position 4.
 - Y: correct (✓) and in position 5? Yes, since PODGY: position 5 is Y. So Y is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).

 So, we now know:
 - Position 2: O (fixed)
 - Position 3: D (fixed)
 - Position 5: Y (fixed)
 - The letter G is in the word, but not in position 4.
 - P is not in the word.

 Also, from previous guesses, we know the word does not contain R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T (all marked absent).

 So the secret word has the form: _ O D _ Y

 And it contains G (somewhere, but not in the 4th position).

 The missing letter is the first letter and the fourth letter (since we have four positions fixed: 2,3,5 and one known letter G that is misplaced).

 But note: the G is not in position 4, so it must be in position 1? Because the only positions left are 1 and 4.

 So possibility: 
 - The G must be in position 1? Because positions 2,3,5 are fixed (O, D, Y) and position 4 is not G (as per feedback: G in wrong position, and specifically in PODGY we guessed it at position 4 and it was wrong). So G cannot be in position 4, and it must be somewhere else. The only other empty slot is position 1.

 Therefore, the word must be: G O D ? Y   with the constraint that the fourth letter is not G (but we already have G in position 1?).

 But wait: in our guess PODGY, we had P in position 1, O in 2, D in 3, G in 4, Y in 5. The feedback for G was that it is in the word but not in position 4.

 Now, if we put G in position 1, then in the secret word, there is a G in position 1? But in that case, for our guess PODGY, when we guessed P in position 1, which was absent (x), meaning the first letter is not P. But if the first letter is G, then in our guess, we didn't have G in position 1? We had P in position 1.

 In the feedback, we have G marked as present (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 4. It doesn't tell us where else it might be, so it could be in position 1? But we didn't guess G in position 1.

 However, when we guessed G only in position 4 (in PODGY), the feedback says G is in the word but not in position 4. So it must be in one of the other positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5? But positions 2,3,5 are occupied by O, D, Y. And we know that O, D, Y are fixed and are in the word. But could the word have duplicate letters? For example, could there be two O's? Or two D's? Or two Y's? 

 But look at position 2: O is fixed. Position 3: D is fixed. Position 5: Y is fixed. So if G is to be placed, it must be in position 1 or 4. But position 4 is ruled out by the feedback, so only position 1 remains.

 Therefore, the secret word must be: G O D ? Y

 But then, what about the absence of P? We tried P in position 1 and it was absent, meaning the first letter is not P. If we put G in position 1, that would be fine because we didn't try G in position 1? We tried G only in position 4.

 So the word is G O D _ Y, and the fourth letter is the one we don't know.

 However, we must check if that matches the feedback for PODGY.

 In PODGY:
 - Position 1: P → absent (x) → correct, because if first letter is G, then P is not in the word? Actually, P is not in the word at all (as per feedback: P(x)), so even if we guessed P in position 1, and the word doesn't have P, that's consistent.
 - Position 2: O → correct (✓) → we have O.
 - Position 3: D → correct (✓) → we have D.
 - Position 4: G → marked as present but wrong position (-). But if the word has G but not in position 4, and if we have G in position 1? Then why wasn't G marked as present in the word? It should be, and it is: the feedback for G (-) means it is present but not in the position we guessed. So if the word is G O D ? Y, then when we guessed PODGY:
   - We have G in position 4: the secret word has G in position 1. So G exists, but in a different position. Therefore, the feedback should mark G as present but not correct position, which it did.

 Now, we have a known G in position 1? But wait, we haven't guessed G in position 1. How do we know? The feedback tells us G is in the word but not in position 4. And the only positions available are 1 and 4? But we know it's not in position 4, and positions 2,3,5 are fixed, so the only position left for G is position 1.

 Therefore, we can deduce that the secret word is G O D ? Y.

 Now, we need to fill the fourth letter. It must be a letter that:
 1. Is not in the eliminated list: R,A,I,S,E,C,U,N,T,P (because P is absent and we just eliminated P).
 2. And it must form a valid English word.

 Potential candidates for the fourth letter: what letters are left? We have eliminated: R,A,I,S,E,C,U,N,T,P.

 Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z. But note: we already know the word has G (in position 1), so we can have another G? But if we put G in position 4, then that would be two G's? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates.

 However, we already have G in position 1? And we are going to put a letter at position 4. But if we put G at position 4, then we have double G. But the feedback from PODGY: when we guessed G in position 4, it was marked as present but wrong position. But if the word has two G's, one at position 1 and one at position 4, then when we guess PODGY with G only in position 4, we should have:
   - For position 4: G is actually also in the word at position 4? Then it should be marked correct? But no, because the secret word only has one G? Or if it has two, but we guessed only one G, then:
     - If the word has two G's, and we guess one G in the correct position (position 4), then it should be marked correct (✓) for position 4? But the feedback marked it as present but wrong position (-), meaning that at position 4, it doesn't match, and since we only have one G in the guess, and the word has a G elsewhere, but not at position 4? Therefore, if there were a G at position 4, it would be marked as correct. So we can conclude: there is no G at position 4, and also, there is only one G in the word? Because if there were two G's, and one is at position 4, then we would have gotten a ✓ for position 4? But we didn't.

 Alternatively, if the word has two G's, one at position 1 and one at position 4, then in our guess PODGY:
   - Position 1: P (absent) → okay.
   - Position 4: G → but if the secret letter at position 4 is G, then we should get a ✓ for that position. But we got a (-), meaning not correct position. So that implies the letter at position 4 in the secret word is not G. Therefore, we cannot have G in position 4.

 Moreover, the feedback indicates that there is a G that is not at position 4. Since we have no other G in the guess, and the secret word must have at least one G, and it is not at position 4, and we have no other positions to put it? Except position 1? So we concluded G must be at position 1.

 And the fourth letter must be a letter that is not G, because if it were G, then position 4 in the secret word would be G, which would have caused our guess at position 4 to be correct (✓), but it wasn't.

 Therefore, the fourth letter must be a non-G letter.

 So, secret word: G O D ? Y

 We need to find a letter for the fourth position from the available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z. (since we eliminated R,A,I,S,E,C,U,N,T,P, and G is already in the word but cannot be at position 4).

 And it must form a valid English word.

 Possible English words:
 - GODLY? G O D L Y → but we haven't tested L, and L is available. GODLY is a word meaning devout.
   Check: positions: G (1), O(2), D(3), L(4), Y(5). Yes.
 - GODDY? Not a word.
 - GOGGY? Not a word.
 - GODF Y? Not a word.
 - GODLY seems a strong candidate.

 What about GODHY? No.

 Or GODMY? No.

 Or GODKY? No.

 Let's check: B? GODBY? Not a word.
 F? GODFY? Not a word.
 H: GODHY? Not a word.
 K: GODKY? Not a word.
 M: GODMY? Not a word.
 Q: GODQY? No.
 V: GODVY? Not a word.
 W: GODWY? Not a word.
 X: GODXY? No.
 Z: GODZY? No.

 What about J? GODJY? No.

 So only GODLY seems to be a valid word.

 But wait: what if the word is GODGY? But that would be G O D G Y → double G? Then position 4 is G. But we argued that if position 4 were G, we should have gotten a ✓ for position 4 in PODGY, but we got a (-). Therefore, GODGY is not possible.

 Also, GODLY does not have double letters? It has G, O, D, L, Y. No duplicates.

 Moreover, we haven't eliminated L yet. From the feedback, we know that L hasn't been tested? In previous guesses, we used letters from RAISE, COUNT, PODGY: which are R,A,I,S,E,C,U,N,T,P,O,D,G,Y. So L is still possible.

 Therefore, GODLY is the only candidate we've found.

 But we must confirm: is there any other possibility? We assumed the first letter must be G. Is there any other possibility?

 What if the G is not in position 1? But where else? We have positions: 
   1: unknown 
   2: O 
   3: D 
   4: unknown 
   5: Y 

 And we know G is somewhere and not in position 4.

 But if we put G in position 1, that seems to be the only available slot. Because position 2 is O (fixed), position 3 is D (fixed), position 5 is Y (fixed), so G must be in position 1? Unless there are more letters? But no, the word is 5 letters.

 Therefore, the word must be G O D ? Y, and the only valid English word fitting this pattern and avoiding eliminated letters is GODLY.

 So we should guess GODLY.

 If we are right, we win. If not, we'll get feedback and adjust.

 But note: we have 3 tries left? So far we have used 3 guesses, so 3 remaining.

 However, if GODLY is the word, we get it.

 Response:
 <thinking>
 We deduce that the secret word must be GODLY based on the feedback:
 - The pattern is _ O D _ Y
 - G must be in the first position (the only available slot since G is not in the fourth position and other positions are fixed).
 - This yields GODLY as the only common English word fitting the pattern and available letters.
 </thinking>
<guess>GODLY</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- **O** in position 2 is correct (✓).
- **D** in position 3 is correct (✓).
- **Y** in position 5 is correct (✓).
- **G** is present (-) but cannot be in position 4 (as guessed in PODGY).
- **P** is absent (x).

The secret word pattern is: _ **O** **D** _ **Y**

**Key deductions:**
1. The absent letters (R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T, P) are eliminated.
2. **G** must be in position 1—this is the only unfilled position where it could logically appear (positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed, and position 4 is invalid for G based on feedback).
3. The remaining slot (position 4) must use an unused letter from the available pool (B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z) that forms a valid English word.

**Validation of GODLY:**
- Fits the pattern: **G O D L Y**.
- Position 4 = **L**, which is untested and valid.
- No conflicting letters (avoids eliminated characters).
- Common English word meaning ""devout or spiritual"".

This is the most probable solution based on deduction.

</thinking>
<guess>GODLY</guess>",GODLY,"We have feedback from the third guess: PODGY -> P(x) O(✓) D(✓) G(-) Y(✓)
 Let's break this down:
 - P: absent (x) → P is not in the word at all.
 - O: correct (✓) and in position 2 (as we knew, but confirmed).
 - D: correct (✓) and in position 3? PODGY is P-O-D-G-Y, so D is the third letter. So D is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 3).
 - G: present but wrong position (-) → G is in the word, but not in position 4.
 - Y: correct (✓) and in position 5? Yes, since PODGY: position 5 is Y. So Y is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).

 So, we now know:
 - Position 2: O (fixed)
 - Position 3: D (fixed)
 - Position 5: Y (fixed)
 - The letter G is in the word, but not in position 4.
 - P is not in the word.

 Also, from previous guesses, we know the word does not contain R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T (all marked absent).

 So the secret word has the form: _ O D _ Y

 And it contains G (somewhere, but not in the 4th position).

 The missing letter is the first letter and the fourth letter (since we have four positions fixed: 2,3,5 and one known letter G that is misplaced).

 But note: the G is not in position 4, so it must be in position 1? Because the only positions left are 1 and 4.

 So possibility: 
 - The G must be in position 1? Because positions 2,3,5 are fixed (O, D, Y) and position 4 is not G (as per feedback: G in wrong position, and specifically in PODGY we guessed it at position 4 and it was wrong). So G cannot be in position 4, and it must be somewhere else. The only other empty slot is position 1.

 Therefore, the word must be: G O D ? Y   with the constraint that the fourth letter is not G (but we already have G in position 1?).

 But wait: in our guess PODGY, we had P in position 1, O in 2, D in 3, G in 4, Y in 5. The feedback for G was that it is in the word but not in position 4.

 Now, if we put G in position 1, then in the secret word, there is a G in position 1? But in that case, for our guess PODGY, when we guessed P in position 1, which was absent (x), meaning the first letter is not P. But if the first letter is G, then in our guess, we didn't have G in position 1? We had P in position 1.

 In the feedback, we have G marked as present (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 4. It doesn't tell us where else it might be, so it could be in position 1? But we didn't guess G in position 1.

 However, when we guessed G only in position 4 (in PODGY), the feedback says G is in the word but not in position 4. So it must be in one of the other positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5? But positions 2,3,5 are occupied by O, D, Y. And we know that O, D, Y are fixed and are in the word. But could the word have duplicate letters? For example, could there be two O's? Or two D's? Or two Y's? 

 But look at position 2: O is fixed. Position 3: D is fixed. Position 5: Y is fixed. So if G is to be placed, it must be in position 1 or 4. But position 4 is ruled out by the feedback, so only position 1 remains.

 Therefore, the secret word must be: G O D ? Y

 But then, what about the absence of P? We tried P in position 1 and it was absent, meaning the first letter is not P. If we put G in position 1, that would be fine because we didn't try G in position 1? We tried G only in position 4.

 So the word is G O D _ Y, and the fourth letter is the one we don't know.

 However, we must check if that matches the feedback for PODGY.

 In PODGY:
 - Position 1: P → absent (x) → correct, because if first letter is G, then P is not in the word? Actually, P is not in the word at all (as per feedback: P(x)), so even if we guessed P in position 1, and the word doesn't have P, that's consistent.
 - Position 2: O → correct (✓) → we have O.
 - Position 3: D → correct (✓) → we have D.
 - Position 4: G → marked as present but wrong position (-). But if the word has G but not in position 4, and if we have G in position 1? Then why wasn't G marked as present in the word? It should be, and it is: the feedback for G (-) means it is present but not in the position we guessed. So if the word is G O D ? Y, then when we guessed PODGY:
   - We have G in position 4: the secret word has G in position 1. So G exists, but in a different position. Therefore, the feedback should mark G as present but not correct position, which it did.

 Now, we have a known G in position 1? But wait, we haven't guessed G in position 1. How do we know? The feedback tells us G is in the word but not in position 4. And the only positions available are 1 and 4? But we know it's not in position 4, and positions 2,3,5 are fixed, so the only position left for G is position 1.

 Therefore, we can deduce that the secret word is G O D ? Y.

 Now, we need to fill the fourth letter. It must be a letter that:
 1. Is not in the eliminated list: R,A,I,S,E,C,U,N,T,P (because P is absent and we just eliminated P).
 2. And it must form a valid English word.

 Potential candidates for the fourth letter: what letters are left? We have eliminated: R,A,I,S,E,C,U,N,T,P.

 Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z. But note: we already know the word has G (in position 1), so we can have another G? But if we put G in position 4, then that would be two G's? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates.

 However, we already have G in position 1? And we are going to put a letter at position 4. But if we put G at position 4, then we have double G. But the feedback from PODGY: when we guessed G in position 4, it was marked as present but wrong position. But if the word has two G's, one at position 1 and one at position 4, then when we guess PODGY with G only in position 4, we should have:
   - For position 4: G is actually also in the word at position 4? Then it should be marked correct? But no, because the secret word only has one G? Or if it has two, but we guessed only one G, then:
     - If the word has two G's, and we guess one G in the correct position (position 4), then it should be marked correct (✓) for position 4? But the feedback marked it as present but wrong position (-), meaning that at position 4, it doesn't match, and since we only have one G in the guess, and the word has a G elsewhere, but not at position 4? Therefore, if there were a G at position 4, it would be marked as correct. So we can conclude: there is no G at position 4, and also, there is only one G in the word? Because if there were two G's, and one is at position 4, then we would have gotten a ✓ for position 4? But we didn't.

 Alternatively, if the word has two G's, one at position 1 and one at position 4, then in our guess PODGY:
   - Position 1: P (absent) → okay.
   - Position 4: G → but if the secret letter at position 4 is G, then we should get a ✓ for that position. But we got a (-), meaning not correct position. So that implies the letter at position 4 in the secret word is not G. Therefore, we cannot have G in position 4.

 Moreover, the feedback indicates that there is a G that is not at position 4. Since we have no other G in the guess, and the secret word must have at least one G, and it is not at position 4, and we have no other positions to put it? Except position 1? So we concluded G must be at position 1.

 And the fourth letter must be a letter that is not G, because if it were G, then position 4 in the secret word would be G, which would have caused our guess at position 4 to be correct (✓), but it wasn't.

 Therefore, the fourth letter must be a non-G letter.

 So, secret word: G O D ? Y

 We need to find a letter for the fourth position from the available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z. (since we eliminated R,A,I,S,E,C,U,N,T,P, and G is already in the word but cannot be at position 4).

 And it must form a valid English word.

 Possible English words:
 - GODLY? G O D L Y → but we haven't tested L, and L is available. GODLY is a word meaning devout.
   Check: positions: G (1), O(2), D(3), L(4), Y(5). Yes.

 H: GODHY? Not a word.
 K: GODKY? Not a word.
 M: GODMY? Not a word.
 Q: GODQY? No.
 V: GODVY? Not a word.
 W: GODWY? Not a word.
 X: GODXY? No.
 Z: GODZY? No.

 What about J? GODJY? No.

 So only GODLY seems to be a valid word.

 But wait: what if the word is GODGY? But that would be G O D G Y → double G? Then position 4 is G. But we argued that if position 4 were G, we should have gotten a ✓ for position 4 in PODGY, but we got a (-). Therefore, GODGY is not possible.

 Also, GODLY does not have double letters? It has G, O, D, L, Y. No duplicates.

 Moreover, we haven't eliminated L yet. From the feedback, we know that L hasn't been tested? In previous guesses, we used letters from RAISE, COUNT, PODGY: which are R,A,I,S,E,C,U,N,T,P,O,D,G,Y. So L is still possible.

 Therefore, GODLY is the only candidate we've found.

 But we must confirm: is there any other possibility? We assumed the first letter must be G. Is there any other possibility?

 What if the G is not in position 1? But where else? We have positions: 
   1: unknown 
   2: O 
   3: D 
   4: unknown 
   5: Y 

 And we know G is somewhere and not in position 4.

 But if we put G in position 1, that seems to be the only available slot. Because position 2 is O (fixed), position 3 is D (fixed), position 5 is Y (fixed), so G must be in position 1? Unless there are more letters? But no, the word is 5 letters.

 Therefore, the word must be G O D ? Y, and the only valid English word fitting this pattern and avoiding eliminated letters is GODLY.

 So we should guess GODLY.

 If we are right, we win. If not, we'll get feedback and adjust.

 But note: we have 3 tries left? So far we have used 3 guesses, so 3 remaining.

 However, if GODLY is the word, we get it.

 Response:
 <thinking>
 We deduce that the secret word must be GODLY based on the feedback:
 - The pattern is _ O D _ Y
 - G must be in the first position (the only available slot since G is not in the fourth position and other positions are fixed).
 - This yields GODLY as the only common English word fitting the pattern and available letters.

<guess>GODLY</guess>Based on the feedback:
- **O** in position 2 is correct (✓).
- **D** in position 3 is correct (✓).
- **Y** in position 5 is correct (✓).
- **G** is present (-) but cannot be in position 4 (as guessed in PODGY).
- **P** is absent (x).

The secret word pattern is: _ **O** **D** _ **Y**

**Key deductions:**
1. The absent letters (R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T, P) are eliminated.
2. **G** must be in position 1—this is the only unfilled position where it could logically appear (positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed, and position 4 is invalid for G based on feedback).
3. The remaining slot (position 4) must use an unused letter from the available pool (B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z) that forms a valid English word.

**Validation of GODLY:**
- Fits the pattern: **G O D L Y**.
- Position 4 = **L**, which is untested and valid.
- No conflicting letters (avoids eliminated characters).
- Common English word meaning ""devout or spiritual"".

This is the most probable solution based on deduction.

</thinking>",Guess 4: GODLY -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) O(✓) D(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
