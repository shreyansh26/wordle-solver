We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
 This means:
   C is not in the word -> so we can avoid words with C.
   R is in the word but in the wrong position -> the word has R, but not in the second position.
   A is in the word but in the wrong position -> the word has A, but not in the third position.
   N is not in the word -> avoid N.
   E is in the word but in the wrong position -> the word has E, but not in the fifth position.

 Therefore, the secret word:
   Does not contain: C, N
   Contains: R, A, E (but not in the positions they were in ""crane"": R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5)

 Known positions:
   The word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ _

 We know R, A, E are present. Since E is not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions (index 1-4, 0-indexed).
 Similarly, A is not in the third position (index 2) and R is not in the second position (index 1).

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We want to use a word that includes R, A, E (to confirm their positions) and avoids C, N.

 Also, we want to try to place R, A, E in positions they might be.

 Since R is not in position 1 (because our guess had R at position 1 and it was wrong) OR wait: in ""crane"", R was at position 2 (if we count starting at 1, but in code index 1). Actually, in the feedback:

   Position 1: C (x) -> index 0
   Position 2: R (-) -> index 1
   Position 3: A (-) -> index 2
   Position 4: N (x) -> index 3
   Position 5: E (-) -> index 4

 So, R is in the word but not at index 1 (second letter). Similarly, A not at index 2 (third letter) and E not at index 4 (fifth letter).

 Since we don't know the positions of R, A, E, we should try a word that places them in new positions.

 Also, we know the first letter is not C (and not any letter that is now ruled out). Also, the fourth letter is not N.

 We can consider words that have R, A, E and use other letters that haven't been ruled out.

 We also want to maximize new information.

 Let's list the letters we know: R, A, E must appear. We don't know about the other two letters.

 Possible word choices:

 We might try a word that starts with a vowel or a consonant that is common and not excluded.

 Since A is one of the letters, we can try to put A in position 1? But wait, we don't know yet if A can be first.

 However, note that R cannot be in position 1? Actually, we don't know. The feedback only said that R is not in position 1 (index 1), but index 0 is still possible? 

 Actually, the feedback for C was at index 0: C(x) meaning C is not in the word at all. But we have no direct information about index 0 (first letter) other than it isn't C.

 Similarly, we haven't tested many consonants at the start.

 Let me clarify: The first letter of the secret word is not C (because C was at index0 and got marked x meaning absent). But it could be R? Note that R was at index1 and was marked absent in that position? But that doesn't preclude R from being at index0? Actually no: If R were at index0, then in the guess ""crane"", the R at index1 would still be in the word, but the feedback for that letter (R) would still be '-' (wrong position) even if R is also present elsewhere? 

 However, note: the feedback per letter does not account for duplicates unless the word has duplicates. Since the feedback showed R(-), it only means there's an R somewhere else. But if the secret word has two R's, we would see the R in the guess only get one mark? Actually, the feedback system: for each letter in the guess, you look at the secret word and mark a '- for each occurrence that is in the wrong position' or '✓ if in the correct position'. However, for duplicate letters, if the secret word has only one R, then only one R in the guess will get a '-' or '✓', and the duplicate will be marked as not present? 

 We must be cautious: the rules say ""each letter in your guess"" receives feedback. So if the secret word has one R and the guess has two R's, then one of them will be marked correctly (if in the right position) or incorrectly (if both in wrong positions) and the extra one will be marked 'x'. 

 However, in our case, ""crane"" has no duplicates. So we are safe.

 Therefore, we know:
   Secret word contains R, but not at position index1 (the second letter). It could be at index0, index2, index3, or index4? But note: we also have A and E to place.

 And E is not at index4, so E must be at one of positions 0,1,2,3? But position1: we had R there and it was not E? Wait, nothing prevents E from being at position1? Actually, the feedback for position1 was R(-), meaning the letter at that position in the guess was R and it was wrong. So the first letter of the secret can be anything except C, etc.

 Now, let's try to form a word that meets:
   Does not use C or N (since they are absent).
   Uses the letters A, E, and R (if they are the only ones we know? Not necessarily, there are two more letters we don't know).
   Also note: we don't have any constraints on the other letters except avoiding C and N.

 Possible guesses: We want to test as many new letters as possible and new positions.

 Some choices:

 Option 1: Start with R? But R could be at index0? Let me choose a word that has R at index0? Then we can see if R is at the start.

 Option 2: Place A in a new position, say index0? Then we can test if A is at the front.

 Let's try to think of words with common structures.

 Since R, A, E must be present and we know their forbidden positions, let me try:

   R cannot be at index1? So in the next guess, try R at index0? Then A and E in different positions.

 Example words: 
   We can try ""RAISE"" -> which has R at the start (index0), then A (index1), I (index2), S (index3), E (index4). 
   But note: A was not at index2? Actually, in ""crane"" we had A at index2 which was wrong, but in ""RAISE"", A is at index1? That's new? Also, E was forbidden at index4? So we cannot put E at index4? 

 In ""RAISE"": E is at index4? Which we cannot do because the feedback said E is not at index4? So we cannot put E at the end? Therefore, ""RAISE"" is invalid for guess because E goes to the end which we know is wrong.

 Then we try to put E not at the end? But in a 5-letter word, we have few options for E? 

 Alternatively, we can try ""AROSE"": 
   A at index0, R at index1, O, S, E at index4? 
   But E at index4 is forbidden? So same problem.

 How about ""EARLY"": 
   E at index0, A at index1, R at index2, L, Y? 
   But note: R cannot be at index2? No, we don't know? We only know from guess1 that R cannot be at index1? So index2 is allowed? 
   Also, E cannot be at index4? But placing E at index0 is fine? 
   Also, we know A cannot be at index2? But in EARLY, A is at index1? That wasn't forbidden? Only index2 was forbidden? 

 Let's check: 
   In ""crane"": 
        index0: C (x) -> so first letter is not C? 
        index1: R (-) -> so no R at index1? 
        index2: A (-) -> so no A at index2? 
        index3: N (x) -> so no N? 
        index4: E (-) -> so no E at index4?

   So for EARLY:
        E at index0 -> not forbidden? 
        A at index1 -> not forbidden? 
        R at index2 -> not forbidden? 
        L: we haven't tested? 
        Y: we haven't tested? 

   Also, we avoid C and N? Yes? 

   We also must have the letters A, E, R? Yes? 

   But note: does EARLY have duplicate letters? No? 

   However, we also need to confirm: in the secret word, A cannot be at index2? and E cannot be at index4? and R cannot be at index1? But EARLY has R at index2? and A at index1? which was the forbidden position for R? 

   Actually, the forbidden position for R is index1? So EARLY has R at index2? That is not forbidden? 

   But for A: we know from guess1 that A is not at index2? In EARLY, A is at index1? That was not forbidden? 

   Similarly, E was forbidden at index4? We are putting E at index0? That is allowed? 

   Therefore, EARLY seems okay? 

   However, note: we have E at index0? If the secret word has E at index0, we will get E(✓)? 

   Also, we have A at index1? But remember that position1 (index1) is forbidden for R? That doesn't say anything about A at index1? 

   So EARLY is a valid guess? 

   But let's consider: Is EARLY a common word? Yes? 

   But there's another problem: we know that R is in the word? But EARLY has R? Okay? 

   Therefore, I will guess ""EARLY"".

 Alternatively, we could try ""PATIO"" but then we don't have E? which we know is in the word? and we also want to include E? 

 Since we know A, R, E are in the word, we should include all three? Then EARLY does include A, R, E? 

 Another alternative: ""STARE"" but E is at the end? and N is absent? But E at the end is forbidden? 

 How about ""ALERT"": 
   A at index0, L at index1, E at index2, R at index3, T at index4? 
   This avoids E at the end? 
   But also, we have R at index3? and we have E at index2? 
   We know: E cannot be at index4? that doesn't prevent at index2? 
   And A at index0? 
   Also, R cannot be at index1? Our guess puts R at index3? 

   Also, we avoid C and N? 

   So ALERT includes A, R, ? ... A, L, E, R, T? It has A, E, R which we know? 

   But ALERT has R twice? Actually: ALERT has one R? Wait: A-L-E-R-T? So one R? 

   However, we haven't tested L and T? 

   Both EARLY and ALERT are valid? 

   Which one gives more information? 

   EARLY: tests letters E, A, R, L, Y? 
   ALERT: tests letters A, L, E, R, T? 

   We know we must include R, A, E? Both do? 

   Previously used letters: C, R, A, N, E? So EARLY introduces L and Y? ALERT introduces L and T? 

   Both L and T are common? 

   Another possibility: ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E? but E at index4 is forbidden? 

   ""ROATE"" -> but E again at the end? 

   How about ""RASPY"": R at index0, A at index1, S at index2, P at index3, Y at index4? 
      Then we haven't included E? which we know is in the word? 
   So we must include E? 

   So we have to choose a word with E? 

   Then EARLY or ALERT? 

   Let me check if ALERT has E? Yes? 

   We might also consider ""TAMER"": 
        T at0, A at1, M at2, E at3, R at4? 
        Avoids E at the end? (E at index3) 
        R at index4? 
        We know R cannot be at index1? But index4 is new? 
        And M? new? 
        Includes R, A, E? 

   But TAMER has no duplicate? 

   Another one? 

   However, note: the word should be valid and common? 

   Among EARLY, ALERT, TAMER? 

   Let me see which one covers more possibilities? 

   But since we have two spots that are not known? 

   I think ALERT is popular? 

   However, I recall: we know A cannot be at index2? In ALERT, A is at index0? In EARLY, A at index1? 

   Let me think: maybe A at index1? That wasn't forbidden? 

   We want to rule out possibilities? 

   Alternatively, consider ""PARSE"": 
        P at0, A at1, R at2, S at3, E at4? -> but E at4 is forbidden? 

   How about ""LATER"": 
        L at0, A at1, T at2, E at3, R at4? 
        E at index3? which is allowed? 
        Then R at index4? 
        So includes A,R,E? 
        Avoids C and N? 
        But note: in ""crane"", A was at index2? which was forbidden? Now we are putting A at index1? that was not forbidden? 
        Similarly, E at index3? 
        But the word ends with R? 

   And LATER is valid? 

   Now, we know R was forbidden only at index1? So index4 is fine?

   However, we don't know about the other constraints? 

   Actually, we are free to use A at index1? 

   So LATER is also a candidate? 

   Given the common words, let me pick ALERT? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ALERT to test:

        If we get:
          A at0: then we don't know if it exists? Actually, we'll get feedback per letter.

   But note: we want to maximize new letters? 

   Previously used letters: C, R, A, N, E -> we are bringing back R,A,E? That's okay? 

   We want to include the known letters to pin down their positions? 

   Since we know A, R, E are present, we can try to put them in positions that we haven't ruled out? 

   For ALERT:
      A at index0? -> test if A is at the start?
      L at index1? -> we haven't tested L? so we test a new letter?
      E at index2? -> test a position that wasn't ruled out for E? (only E not at index4? So position2 is possible? but also, in the previous guess, A was at index2? but that doesn't imply E cannot be there? 
      R at index3? -> position3? allowed? 
      T at index4? -> we haven't tested T? 

   For EARLY:
      E at index0? -> test if E is at the start?
      A at index1? -> test if A is at position1? which wasn't forbidden? 
      R at index2? -> test if R is at position2? 
      L at index3? 
      Y at index4? 

   We cannot have E at index4? But we are testing it at index0? 

   Both are valid? 

   I think EARLY might be better? because it puts A at position1? which we haven't tested? and we know position1 was the one that had R? but now we are testing A there? 

   Alternatively, we can try to avoid putting known letters in positions that we haven't tested? 

   Actually, we are forced to put known letters? 

   Now, let me choose EARLY? 

   But wait: the word must be in the dictionary? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""IRATE""? but I think E at the end? 

   I've got a word: ""REALM"": 
        R at index0 -> good? 
        E at index1? -> position1: but we know that R was not allowed at position1? but for E? 
        A at index2? -> but we know A was not allowed at index2? 
        L at index3? 
        M at index4? 

   No: if we put A at index2? that was forbidden? 

   So REALM is invalid? because the A is at index2? which we know is not allowed? 

   Therefore, we must avoid putting A at index2? Similarly, avoid E at index4? 

   Now, EARLY: 
        index0: E -> that's new? 
        index1: A -> not forbidden because we only know A not at index2? 
        index2: R -> not forbidden? 
        index3: L -> new? 
        index4: Y -> new? 

   So EARLY doesn't put any known letter at a forbidden position? 

   ALERT:
        index0: A -> new position? 
        index1: L -> new? 
        index2: E -> new? but note: we only know E not at index4? but we don't know if E can be at index2? 
        index3: R -> new? 
        index4: T -> new? 

   So both EARLY and ALERT are acceptable? 

   Decision: Let me pick ""ALERT"" because it covers positions that we haven't tested? And we are testing A at the start? 

   Actually, EARLY puts A at index1? and index1 was the position we had a bad R? Now we are putting A there? 

   If we get a '-' for A at index1? Then we know A is not at index1? 

   Similarly, if we get a '✓'? Then we know A is there? 

   But then we also test E and R? 

   Now, what about ALERT:

        A at index0: if we get ✓, then we know the first letter is A? 
        If we get '-', then A is in the word but not at start? 
        If get 'x'? then that would conflict? because we know A is in the word? 

   Similarly for the other letters? 

   But note: we know A is in the word? So we cannot get 'x' for A unless the word has duplicate? But ALERT has one A? 

   Actually, if the secret word has A but not at index0? then we would get '-'? 

   I think ALERT is a good choice? 

   But I just saw: ALERT puts A at index0? and E at index2? 

   How about EARLY: it puts E at index0? 

   There is no strong reason? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""TARES"": 
        T at0, A at1, R at2, E at3, S at4? 
        Then E is not at the end? (index3? not index4? okay? 
        But index4 is S? 
        So avoids E at the end? 
        And R is at index2? which is new? 
        But TARSE? Wait, TARES? 

   However, TARES (a valid word?) means? ... yes? 

   But in feedback: the word must be English word? 

   Actually, I think TARES is valid? 

   And it has A, R, E? 

   And we avoid the forbidden positions? 
        A at index1? -> not forbidden? 
        E at index3? -> not end? so allowed? 

   And R at index2? -> not forbidden? 

   Then that's good? 

   But TARES has E at index3? 

   We are testing T and S? 

   However, I'm leaning toward EARLY? 

   Given the choices, I will choose ""ALERT"" for the second guess? 

   Alternatively, note: we haven't tested many consonants? 

   Finally, I choose: 
        ""ALERT"" -> because it tests A at the start and E at the third? 

   But wait: what if A is at the start? Then we get a ✓? 

   What if not? then we get a '-'? 

   Similarly? 

   Let's go with ""ALERT"".

   However, to be safe, I'll look up common words? 

   Given the thought: ALERT is a common word? 

   Therefore, second guess: ""ALERT""

  But wait: previously, in the feedback, we got R(-) at index1? meaning R is in the word but not at index1? So if we put R at index3? that might be correct? 

  Also, we can see what happens? 

  So <guess>alert</guess> 
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C and N are **not** in the secret word.  
- R, A, and E **are** in the word but were in incorrect positions. Specifically:  
  - R is not at position 2 (index 1).  
  - A is not at position 3 (index 2).  
  - E is not at position 5 (index 4).  

For the second guess, we need to use:  
- R, A, and E to verify their positions.  
- New letters to gather more information.  
- Avoid C, N, and placing R/A/E in forbidden positions.  

The word ""ALERT"" is a strong candidate because:  
- It includes known letters (A, E, R) in untested positions:  
  - A at index 0 (avoiding index 2).  
  - E at index 2 (avoiding index 4).  
  - R at index 3 (avoiding index 1).  
- It introduces new letters (L, T) for further testing.  
- It maximizes information by:  
  - Testing A at the start.  
  - Checking E and R in fresh positions.  
- It adheres to feedback constraints.  

<guess>alert</guess>",alert,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)

   C is not in the word -> so we can avoid words with C.
   R is in the word but in the wrong position -> the word has R, but not in the second position.
   A is in the word but in the wrong position -> the word has A, but not in the third position.
   N is not in the word -> avoid N.
   E is in the word but in the wrong position -> the word has E, but not in the fifth position.

 Therefore, the secret word:
   Does not contain: C, N
   Contains: R, A, E (but not in the positions they were in ""crane"": R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5)

 Known positions:
   The word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ _

 We know R, A, E are present. Since E is not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions (index 1-4, 0-indexed).
 Similarly, A is not in the third position (index 2) and R is not in the second position (index 1).

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We want to use a word that includes R, A, E (to confirm their positions) and avoids C, N.

 Also, we want to try to place R, A, E in positions they might be.

 Since R is not in position 1 (because our guess had R at position 1 and it was wrong) OR wait: in ""crane"", R was at position 2 (if we count starting at 1, but in code index 1). Actually, in the feedback:

   Position 1: C (x) -> index 0
   Position 2: R (-) -> index 1
   Position 3: A (-) -> index 2
   Position 4: N (x) -> index 3
   Position 5: E (-) -> index 4

 So, R is in the word but not at index 1 (second letter). Similarly, A not at index 2 (third letter) and E not at index 4 (fifth letter).

 Since we don't know the positions of R, A, E, we should try a word that places them in new positions.

 Also, we know the first letter is not C (and not any letter that is now ruled out). Also, the fourth letter is not N.

 We can consider words that have R, A, E and use other letters that haven't been ruled out.

 We also want to maximize new information.

 Let's list the letters we know: R, A, E must appear. We don't know about the other two letters.

 Possible word choices:

 We might try a word that starts with a vowel or a consonant that is common and not excluded.

 Since A is one of the letters, we can try to put A in position 1? But wait, we don't know yet if A can be first.

 However, note that R cannot be in position 1? Actually, we don't know. The feedback only said that R is not in position 1 (index 1), but index 0 is still possible? 

 Actually, the feedback for C was at index 0: C(x) meaning C is not in the word at all. But we have no direct information about index 0 (first letter) other than it isn't C.

 Similarly, we haven't tested many consonants at the start.

 Let me clarify: The first letter of the secret word is not C (because C was at index0 and got marked x meaning absent). But it could be R? Note that R was at index1 and was marked absent in that position? But that doesn't preclude R from being at index0? Actually no: If R were at index0, then in the guess ""crane"", the R at index1 would still be in the word, but the feedback for that letter (R) would still be '-' (wrong position) even if R is also present elsewhere? 

 However, note: the feedback per letter does not account for duplicates unless the word has duplicates. Since the feedback showed R(-), it only means there's an R somewhere else. But if the secret word has two R's, we would see the R in the guess only get one mark? Actually, the feedback system: for each letter in the guess, you look at the secret word and mark a '- for each occurrence that is in the wrong position' or '✓ if in the correct position'. However, for duplicate letters, if the secret word has only one R, then only one R in the guess will get a '-' or '✓', and the duplicate will be marked as not present? 

 We must be cautious: the rules say ""each letter in your guess"" receives feedback. So if the secret word has one R and the guess has two R's, then one of them will be marked correctly (if in the right position) or incorrectly (if both in wrong positions) and the extra one will be marked 'x'. 

 However, in our case, ""crane"" has no duplicates. So we are safe.

 Therefore, we know:
   Secret word contains R, but not at position index1 (the second letter). It could be at index0, index2, index3, or index4? But note: we also have A and E to place.

 And E is not at index4, so E must be at one of positions 0,1,2,3? But position1: we had R there and it was not E? Wait, nothing prevents E from being at position1? Actually, the feedback for position1 was R(-), meaning the letter at that position in the guess was R and it was wrong. So the first letter of the secret can be anything except C, etc.

 Now, let's try to form a word that meets:
   Does not use C or N (since they are absent).
   Uses the letters A, E, and R (if they are the only ones we know? Not necessarily, there are two more letters we don't know).
   Also note: we don't have any constraints on the other letters except avoiding C and N.

 Possible guesses: We want to test as many new letters as possible and new positions.

 Some choices:

 Option 1: Start with R? But R could be at index0? Let me choose a word that has R at index0? Then we can see if R is at the start.

 Option 2: Place A in a new position, say index0? Then we can test if A is at the front.

 Let's try to think of words with common structures.

 Since R, A, E must be present and we know their forbidden positions, let me try:

   R cannot be at index1? So in the next guess, try R at index0? Then A and E in different positions.

 Example words: 
   We can try ""RAISE"" -> which has R at the start (index0), then A (index1), I (index2), S (index3), E (index4). 
   But note: A was not at index2? Actually, in ""crane"" we had A at index2 which was wrong, but in ""RAISE"", A is at index1? That's new? Also, E was forbidden at index4? So we cannot put E at index4? 

 In ""RAISE"": E is at index4? Which we cannot do because the feedback said E is not at index4? So we cannot put E at the end? Therefore, ""RAISE"" is invalid for guess because E goes to the end which we know is wrong.

 Then we try to put E not at the end? But in a 5-letter word, we have few options for E? 

 Alternatively, we can try ""AROSE"": 
   A at index0, R at index1, O, S, E at index4? 
   But E at index4 is forbidden? So same problem.

 How about ""EARLY"": 
   E at index0, A at index1, R at index2, L, Y? 
   But note: R cannot be at index2? No, we don't know? We only know from guess1 that R cannot be at index1? So index2 is allowed? 
   Also, E cannot be at index4? But placing E at index0 is fine? 
   Also, we know A cannot be at index2? But in EARLY, A is at index1? That wasn't forbidden? Only index2 was forbidden? 

 Let's check: 
   In ""crane"": 
        index0: C (x) -> so first letter is not C? 
        index1: R (-) -> so no R at index1? 
        index2: A (-) -> so no A at index2? 
        index3: N (x) -> so no N? 
        index4: E (-) -> so no E at index4?

   So for EARLY:
        E at index0 -> not forbidden? 
        A at index1 -> not forbidden? 
        R at index2 -> not forbidden? 
        L: we haven't tested? 
        Y: we haven't tested? 

   Also, we avoid C and N? Yes? 

   We also must have the letters A, E, R? Yes? 

   But note: does EARLY have duplicate letters? No? 

   However, we also need to confirm: in the secret word, A cannot be at index2? and E cannot be at index4? and R cannot be at index1? But EARLY has R at index2? and A at index1? which was the forbidden position for R? 

   Actually, the forbidden position for R is index1? So EARLY has R at index2? That is not forbidden? 

   But for A: we know from guess1 that A is not at index2? In EARLY, A is at index1? That was not forbidden? 

   Similarly, E was forbidden at index4? We are putting E at index0? That is allowed? 

   Therefore, EARLY seems okay? 

   However, note: we have E at index0? If the secret word has E at index0, we will get E(✓)? 

   Also, we have A at index1? But remember that position1 (index1) is forbidden for R? That doesn't say anything about A at index1? 

   So EARLY is a valid guess? 

   But let's consider: Is EARLY a common word? Yes? 

   But there's another problem: we know that R is in the word? But EARLY has R? Okay? 

   Therefore, I will guess ""EARLY"".

 Alternatively, we could try ""PATIO"" but then we don't have E? which we know is in the word? and we also want to include E? 

 Since we know A, R, E are in the word, we should include all three? Then EARLY does include A, R, E? 

 Another alternative: ""STARE"" but E is at the end? and N is absent? But E at the end is forbidden? 

 How about ""ALERT"": 
   A at index0, L at index1, E at index2, R at index3, T at index4? 
   This avoids E at the end? 
   But also, we have R at index3? and we have E at index2? 
   We know: E cannot be at index4? that doesn't prevent at index2? 
   And A at index0? 
   Also, R cannot be at index1? Our guess puts R at index3? 

   Also, we avoid C and N? 

   So ALERT includes A, R, ? ... A, L, E, R, T? It has A, E, R which we know? 

   But ALERT has R twice? Actually: ALERT has one R? Wait: A-L-E-R-T? So one R? 

   However, we haven't tested L and T? 

   Both EARLY and ALERT are valid? 

   Which one gives more information? 

   EARLY: tests letters E, A, R, L, Y? 
   ALERT: tests letters A, L, E, R, T? 

   We know we must include R, A, E? Both do? 

   Previously used letters: C, R, A, N, E? So EARLY introduces L and Y? ALERT introduces L and T? 

   Both L and T are common? 

   Another possibility: ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E? but E at index4 is forbidden? 

   ""ROATE"" -> but E again at the end? 

   How about ""RASPY"": R at index0, A at index1, S at index2, P at index3, Y at index4? 
      Then we haven't included E? which we know is in the word? 
   So we must include E? 

   So we have to choose a word with E? 

   Then EARLY or ALERT? 

   Let me check if ALERT has E? Yes? 

   We might also consider ""TAMER"": 
        T at0, A at1, M at2, E at3, R at4? 
        Avoids E at the end? (E at index3) 
        R at index4? 
        We know R cannot be at index1? But index4 is new? 
        And M? new? 
        Includes R, A, E? 

   But TAMER has no duplicate? 

   Another one? 

   However, note: the word should be valid and common? 

   Among EARLY, ALERT, TAMER? 

   Let me see which one covers more possibilities? 

   But since we have two spots that are not known? 

   I think ALERT is popular? 

   However, I recall: we know A cannot be at index2? In ALERT, A is at index0? In EARLY, A at index1? 

   Let me think: maybe A at index1? That wasn't forbidden? 

   We want to rule out possibilities? 

   Alternatively, consider ""PARSE"": 
        P at0, A at1, R at2, S at3, E at4? -> but E at4 is forbidden? 

   How about ""LATER"": 
        L at0, A at1, T at2, E at3, R at4? 
        E at index3? which is allowed? 
        Then R at index4? 
        So includes A,R,E? 
        Avoids C and N? 
        But note: in ""crane"", A was at index2? which was forbidden? Now we are putting A at index1? that was not forbidden? 
        Similarly, E at index3? 
        But the word ends with R? 

   And LATER is valid? 

   Now, we know R was forbidden only at index1? So index4 is fine?

   However, we don't know about the other constraints? 

   Actually, we are free to use A at index1? 

   So LATER is also a candidate? 

   Given the common words, let me pick ALERT? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ALERT to test:

        If we get:
          A at0: then we don't know if it exists? Actually, we'll get feedback per letter.

   But note: we want to maximize new letters? 

   Previously used letters: C, R, A, N, E -> we are bringing back R,A,E? That's okay? 

   We want to include the known letters to pin down their positions? 

   Since we know A, R, E are present, we can try to put them in positions that we haven't ruled out? 

   For ALERT:
      A at index0? -> test if A is at the start?
      L at index1? -> we haven't tested L? so we test a new letter?
      E at index2? -> test a position that wasn't ruled out for E? (only E not at index4? So position2 is possible? but also, in the previous guess, A was at index2? but that doesn't imply E cannot be there? 
      R at index3? -> position3? allowed? 
      T at index4? -> we haven't tested T? 

   For EARLY:
      E at index0? -> test if E is at the start?
      A at index1? -> test if A is at position1? which wasn't forbidden? 
      R at index2? -> test if R is at position2? 
      L at index3? 
      Y at index4? 

   We cannot have E at index4? But we are testing it at index0? 

   Both are valid? 

   I think EARLY might be better? because it puts A at position1? which we haven't tested? and we know position1 was the one that had R? but now we are testing A there? 

   Alternatively, we can try to avoid putting known letters in positions that we haven't tested? 

   Actually, we are forced to put known letters? 

   Now, let me choose EARLY? 

   But wait: the word must be in the dictionary? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""IRATE""? but I think E at the end? 

   I've got a word: ""REALM"": 
        R at index0 -> good? 
        E at index1? -> position1: but we know that R was not allowed at position1? but for E? 
        A at index2? -> but we know A was not allowed at index2? 
        L at index3? 
        M at index4? 

   No: if we put A at index2? that was forbidden? 

   So REALM is invalid? because the A is at index2? which we know is not allowed? 

   Therefore, we must avoid putting A at index2? Similarly, avoid E at index4? 

   Now, EARLY: 
        index0: E -> that's new? 
        index1: A -> not forbidden because we only know A not at index2? 
        index2: R -> not forbidden? 
        index3: L -> new? 
        index4: Y -> new? 

   So EARLY doesn't put any known letter at a forbidden position? 

   ALERT:
        index0: A -> new position? 
        index1: L -> new? 
        index2: E -> new? but note: we only know E not at index4? but we don't know if E can be at index2? 
        index3: R -> new? 
        index4: T -> new? 

   So both EARLY and ALERT are acceptable? 

   Decision: Let me pick ""ALERT"" because it covers positions that we haven't tested? And we are testing A at the start? 

   Actually, EARLY puts A at index1? and index1 was the position we had a bad R? Now we are putting A there? 

   If we get a '-' for A at index1? Then we know A is not at index1? 

   Similarly, if we get a '✓'? Then we know A is there? 

   But then we also test E and R? 

   Now, what about ALERT:

        A at index0: if we get ✓, then we know the first letter is A? 
        If we get '-', then A is in the word but not at start? 
        If get 'x'? then that would conflict? because we know A is in the word? 

   Similarly for the other letters? 

   But note: we know A is in the word? So we cannot get 'x' for A unless the word has duplicate? But ALERT has one A? 

   Actually, if the secret word has A but not at index0? then we would get '-'? 

   I think ALERT is a good choice? 

   But I just saw: ALERT puts A at index0? and E at index2? 

   How about EARLY: it puts E at index0? 

   There is no strong reason? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""TARES"": 
        T at0, A at1, R at2, E at3, S at4? 
        Then E is not at the end? (index3? not index4? okay? 
        But index4 is S? 
        So avoids E at the end? 
        And R is at index2? which is new? 
        But TARSE? Wait, TARES? 

   However, TARES (a valid word?) means? ... yes? 

   But in feedback: the word must be English word? 

   Actually, I think TARES is valid? 

   And it has A, R, E? 

   And we avoid the forbidden positions? 
        A at index1? -> not forbidden? 
        E at index3? -> not end? so allowed? 

   And R at index2? -> not forbidden? 

   Then that's good? 

   But TARES has E at index3? 

   We are testing T and S? 

   However, I'm leaning toward EARLY? 

   Given the choices, I will choose ""ALERT"" for the second guess? 

   Alternatively, note: we haven't tested many consonants? 

   Finally, I choose: 
        ""ALERT"" -> because it tests A at the start and E at the third? 

   But wait: what if A is at the start? Then we get a ✓? 

   What if not? then we get a '-'? 

   Similarly? 

   Let's go with ""ALERT"".

   However, to be safe, I'll look up common words? 

   Given the thought: ALERT is a common word? 

   Therefore, second guess: ""ALERT""

  But wait: previously, in the feedback, we got R(-) at index1? meaning R is in the word but not at index1? So if we put R at index3? that might be correct? 

  Also, we can see what happens? 

  So <guess>alert</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C and N are **not** in the secret word.  
- R, A, and E **are** in the word but were in incorrect positions. Specifically:  
  - R is not at position 2 (index 1).  
  - A is not at position 3 (index 2).  
  - E is not at position 5 (index 4).  

For the second guess, we need to use:  
- R, A, and E to verify their positions.  
- New letters to gather more information.  
- Avoid C, N, and placing R/A/E in forbidden positions.  

The word ""ALERT"" is a strong candidate because:  
- It includes known letters (A, E, R) in untested positions:  
  - A at index 0 (avoiding index 2).  
  - E at index 2 (avoiding index 4).  
  - R at index 3 (avoiding index 1).  
- It introduces new letters (L, T) for further testing.  
- It maximizes information by:  
  - Testing A at the start.  
  - Checking E and R in fresh positions.  
- It adheres to feedback constraints.",Guess 2: alert -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) E(-) R(✓) T(-),FAIL

 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
 This means:
   C is not in the word -> so we can avoid words with C.
   R is in the word but in the wrong position -> the word has R, but not in the second position.
   A is in the word but in the wrong position -> the word has A, but not in the third position.
   N is not in the word -> avoid N.
   E is in the word but in the wrong position -> the word has E, but not in the fifth position.

 Therefore, the secret word:
   Does not contain: C, N
   Contains: R, A, E (but not in the positions they were in ""crane"": R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5)

 Known positions:
   The word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ _

 We know R, A, E are present. Since E is not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions (index 1-4, 0-indexed).
 Similarly, A is not in the third position (index 2) and R is not in the second position (index 1).

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We want to use a word that includes R, A, E (to confirm their positions) and avoids C, N.

 Also, we want to try to place R, A, E in positions they might be.

 Since R is not in position 1 (because our guess had R at position 1 and it was wrong) OR wait: in ""crane"", R was at position 2 (if we count starting at 1, but in code index 1). Actually, in the feedback:

   Position 1: C (x) -> index 0
   Position 2: R (-) -> index 1
   Position 3: A (-) -> index 2
   Position 4: N (x) -> index 3
   Position 5: E (-) -> index 4

 So, R is in the word but not at index 1 (second letter). Similarly, A not at index 2 (third letter) and E not at index 4 (fifth letter).

 Since we don't know the positions of R, A, E, we should try a word that places them in new positions.

 Also, we know the first letter is not C (and not any letter that is now ruled out). Also, the fourth letter is not N.

 We can consider words that have R, A, E and use other letters that haven't been ruled out.

 We also want to maximize new information.

 Let's list the letters we know: R, A, E must appear. We don't know about the other two letters.

 Possible word choices:

 We might try a word that starts with a vowel or a consonant that is common and not excluded.

 Since A is one of the letters, we can try to put A in position 1? But wait, we don't know yet if A can be first.

 However, note that R cannot be in position 1? Actually, we don't know. The feedback only said that R is not in position 1 (index 1), but index 0 is still possible? 

 Actually, the feedback for C was at index 0: C(x) meaning C is not in the word at all. But we have no direct information about index 0 (first letter) other than it isn't C.

 Similarly, we haven't tested many consonants at the start.

 Let me clarify: The first letter of the secret word is not C (because C was at index0 and got marked x meaning absent). But it could be R? Note that R was at index1 and was marked absent in that position? But that doesn't preclude R from being at index0? Actually no: If R were at index0, then in the guess ""crane"", the R at index1 would still be in the word, but the feedback for that letter (R) would still be '-' (wrong position) even if R is also present elsewhere? 

 However, note: the feedback per letter does not account for duplicates unless the word has duplicates. Since the feedback showed R(-), it only means there's an R somewhere else. But if the secret word has two R's, we would see the R in the guess only get one mark? Actually, the feedback system: for each letter in the guess, you look at the secret word and mark a '- for each occurrence that is in the wrong position' or '✓ if in the correct position'. However, for duplicate letters, if the secret word has only one R, then only one R in the guess will get a '-' or '✓', and the duplicate will be marked as not present? 

 We must be cautious: the rules say ""each letter in your guess"" receives feedback. So if the secret word has one R and the guess has two R's, then one of them will be marked correctly (if in the right position) or incorrectly (if both in wrong positions) and the extra one will be marked 'x'. 

 However, in our case, ""crane"" has no duplicates. So we are safe.

 Therefore, we know:
   Secret word contains R, but not at position index1 (the second letter). It could be at index0, index2, index3, or index4? But note: we also have A and E to place.

 And E is not at index4, so E must be at one of positions 0,1,2,3? But position1: we had R there and it was not E? Wait, nothing prevents E from being at position1? Actually, the feedback for position1 was R(-), meaning the letter at that position in the guess was R and it was wrong. So the first letter of the secret can be anything except C, etc.

 Now, let's try to form a word that meets:
   Does not use C or N (since they are absent).
   Uses the letters A, E, and R (if they are the only ones we know? Not necessarily, there are two more letters we don't know).
   Also note: we don't have any constraints on the other letters except avoiding C and N.

 Possible guesses: We want to test as many new letters as possible and new positions.

 Some choices:

 Option 1: Start with R? But R could be at index0? Let me choose a word that has R at index0? Then we can see if R is at the start.

 Option 2: Place A in a new position, say index0? Then we can test if A is at the front.

 Let's try to think of words with common structures.

 Since R, A, E must be present and we know their forbidden positions, let me try:

   R cannot be at index1? So in the next guess, try R at index0? Then A and E in different positions.

 Example words: 
   We can try ""RAISE"" -> which has R at the start (index0), then A (index1), I (index2), S (index3), E (index4). 
   But note: A was not at index2? Actually, in ""crane"" we had A at index2 which was wrong, but in ""RAISE"", A is at index1? That's new? Also, E was forbidden at index4? So we cannot put E at index4? 

 In ""RAISE"": E is at index4? Which we cannot do because the feedback said E is not at index4? So we cannot put E at the end? Therefore, ""RAISE"" is invalid for guess because E goes to the end which we know is wrong.

 Then we try to put E not at the end? But in a 5-letter word, we have few options for E? 

 Alternatively, we can try ""AROSE"": 
   A at index0, R at index1, O, S, E at index4? 
   But E at index4 is forbidden? So same problem.

 How about ""EARLY"": 
   E at index0, A at index1, R at index2, L, Y? 
   But note: R cannot be at index2? No, we don't know? We only know from guess1 that R cannot be at index1? So index2 is allowed? 
   Also, E cannot be at index4? But placing E at index0 is fine? 
   Also, we know A cannot be at index2? But in EARLY, A is at index1? That wasn't forbidden? Only index2 was forbidden? 

 Let's check: 
   In ""crane"": 
        index0: C (x) -> so first letter is not C? 
        index1: R (-) -> so no R at index1? 
        index2: A (-) -> so no A at index2? 
        index3: N (x) -> so no N? 
        index4: E (-) -> so no E at index4?

   So for EARLY:
        E at index0 -> not forbidden? 
        A at index1 -> not forbidden? 
        R at index2 -> not forbidden? 
        L: we haven't tested? 
        Y: we haven't tested? 

   Also, we avoid C and N? Yes? 

   We also must have the letters A, E, R? Yes? 

   But note: does EARLY have duplicate letters? No? 

   However, we also need to confirm: in the secret word, A cannot be at index2? and E cannot be at index4? and R cannot be at index1? But EARLY has R at index2? and A at index1? which was the forbidden position for R? 

   Actually, the forbidden position for R is index1? So EARLY has R at index2? That is not forbidden? 

   But for A: we know from guess1 that A is not at index2? In EARLY, A is at index1? That was not forbidden? 

   Similarly, E was forbidden at index4? We are putting E at index0? That is allowed? 

   Therefore, EARLY seems okay? 

   However, note: we have E at index0? If the secret word has E at index0, we will get E(✓)? 

   Also, we have A at index1? But remember that position1 (index1) is forbidden for R? That doesn't say anything about A at index1? 

   So EARLY is a valid guess? 

   But let's consider: Is EARLY a common word? Yes? 

   But there's another problem: we know that R is in the word? But EARLY has R? Okay? 

   Therefore, I will guess ""EARLY"".

 Alternatively, we could try ""PATIO"" but then we don't have E? which we know is in the word? and we also want to include E? 

 Since we know A, R, E are in the word, we should include all three? Then EARLY does include A, R, E? 

 Another alternative: ""STARE"" but E is at the end? and N is absent? But E at the end is forbidden? 

 How about ""ALERT"": 
   A at index0, L at index1, E at index2, R at index3, T at index4? 
   This avoids E at the end? 
   But also, we have R at index3? and we have E at index2? 
   We know: E cannot be at index4? that doesn't prevent at index2? 
   And A at index0? 
   Also, R cannot be at index1? Our guess puts R at index3? 

   Also, we avoid C and N? 

   So ALERT includes A, R, ? ... A, L, E, R, T? It has A, E, R which we know? 

   But ALERT has R twice? Actually: ALERT has one R? Wait: A-L-E-R-T? So one R? 

   However, we haven't tested L and T? 

   Both EARLY and ALERT are valid? 

   Which one gives more information? 

   EARLY: tests letters E, A, R, L, Y? 
   ALERT: tests letters A, L, E, R, T? 

   We know we must include R, A, E? Both do? 

   Previously used letters: C, R, A, N, E? So EARLY introduces L and Y? ALERT introduces L and T? 

   Both L and T are common? 

   Another possibility: ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E? but E at index4 is forbidden? 

   ""ROATE"" -> but E again at the end? 

   How about ""RASPY"": R at index0, A at index1, S at index2, P at index3, Y at index4? 
      Then we haven't included E? which we know is in the word? 
   So we must include E? 

   So we have to choose a word with E? 

   Then EARLY or ALERT? 

   Let me check if ALERT has E? Yes? 

   We might also consider ""TAMER"": 
        T at0, A at1, M at2, E at3, R at4? 
        Avoids E at the end? (E at index3) 
        R at index4? 
        We know R cannot be at index1? But index4 is new? 
        And M? new? 
        Includes R, A, E? 

   But TAMER has no duplicate? 

   Another one? 

   However, note: the word should be valid and common? 

   Among EARLY, ALERT, TAMER? 

   Let me see which one covers more possibilities? 

   But since we have two spots that are not known? 

   I think ALERT is popular? 

   However, I recall: we know A cannot be at index2? In ALERT, A is at index0? In EARLY, A at index1? 

   Let me think: maybe A at index1? That wasn't forbidden? 

   We want to rule out possibilities? 

   Alternatively, consider ""PARSE"": 
        P at0, A at1, R at2, S at3, E at4? -> but E at4 is forbidden? 

   How about ""LATER"": 
        L at0, A at1, T at2, E at3, R at4? 
        E at index3? which is allowed? 
        Then R at index4? 
        So includes A,R,E? 
        Avoids C and N? 
        But note: in ""crane"", A was at index2? which was forbidden? Now we are putting A at index1? that was not forbidden? 
        Similarly, E at index3? 
        But the word ends with R? 

   And LATER is valid? 

   Now, we know R was forbidden only at index1? So index4 is fine?

   However, we don't know about the other constraints? 

   Actually, we are free to use A at index1? 

   So LATER is also a candidate? 

   Given the common words, let me pick ALERT? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ALERT to test:

        If we get:
          A at0: then we don't know if it exists? Actually, we'll get feedback per letter.

   But note: we want to maximize new letters? 

   Previously used letters: C, R, A, N, E -> we are bringing back R,A,E? That's okay? 

   We want to include the known letters to pin down their positions? 

   Since we know A, R, E are present, we can try to put them in positions that we haven't ruled out? 

   For ALERT:
      A at index0? -> test if A is at the start?
      L at index1? -> we haven't tested L? so we test a new letter?
      E at index2? -> test a position that wasn't ruled out for E? (only E not at index4? So position2 is possible? but also, in the previous guess, A was at index2? but that doesn't imply E cannot be there? 
      R at index3? -> position3? allowed? 
      T at index4? -> we haven't tested T? 

   For EARLY:
      E at index0? -> test if E is at the start?
      A at index1? -> test if A is at position1? which wasn't forbidden? 
      R at index2? -> test if R is at position2? 
      L at index3? 
      Y at index4? 

   We cannot have E at index4? But we are testing it at index0? 

   Both are valid? 

   I think EARLY might be better? because it puts A at position1? which we haven't tested? and we know position1 was the one that had R? but now we are testing A there? 

   Alternatively, we can try to avoid putting known letters in positions that we haven't tested? 

   Actually, we are forced to put known letters? 

   Now, let me choose EARLY? 

   But wait: the word must be in the dictionary? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""IRATE""? but I think E at the end? 

   I've got a word: ""REALM"": 
        R at index0 -> good? 
        E at index1? -> position1: but we know that R was not allowed at position1? but for E? 
        A at index2? -> but we know A was not allowed at index2? 
        L at index3? 
        M at index4? 

   No: if we put A at index2? that was forbidden? 

   So REALM is invalid? because the A is at index2? which we know is not allowed? 

   Therefore, we must avoid putting A at index2? Similarly, avoid E at index4? 

   Now, EARLY: 
        index0: E -> that's new? 
        index1: A -> not forbidden because we only know A not at index2? 
        index2: R -> not forbidden? 
        index3: L -> new? 
        index4: Y -> new? 

   So EARLY doesn't put any known letter at a forbidden position? 

   ALERT:
        index0: A -> new position? 
        index1: L -> new? 
        index2: E -> new? but note: we only know E not at index4? but we don't know if E can be at index2? 
        index3: R -> new? 
        index4: T -> new? 

   So both EARLY and ALERT are acceptable? 

   Decision: Let me pick ""ALERT"" because it covers positions that we haven't tested? And we are testing A at the start? 

   Actually, EARLY puts A at index1? and index1 was the position we had a bad R? Now we are putting A there? 

   If we get a '-' for A at index1? Then we know A is not at index1? 

   Similarly, if we get a '✓'? Then we know A is there? 

   But then we also test E and R? 

   Now, what about ALERT:

        A at index0: if we get ✓, then we know the first letter is A? 
        If we get '-', then A is in the word but not at start? 
        If get 'x'? then that would conflict? because we know A is in the word? 

   Similarly for the other letters? 

   But note: we know A is in the word? So we cannot get 'x' for A unless the word has duplicate? But ALERT has one A? 

   Actually, if the secret word has A but not at index0? then we would get '-'? 

   I think ALERT is a good choice? 

   But I just saw: ALERT puts A at index0? and E at index2? 

   How about EARLY: it puts E at index0? 

   There is no strong reason? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""TARES"": 
        T at0, A at1, R at2, E at3, S at4? 
        Then E is not at the end? (index3? not index4? okay? 
        But index4 is S? 
        So avoids E at the end? 
        And R is at index2? which is new? 
        But TARSE? Wait, TARES? 

   However, TARES (a valid word?) means? ... yes? 

   But in feedback: the word must be English word? 

   Actually, I think TARES is valid? 

   And it has A, R, E? 

   And we avoid the forbidden positions? 
        A at index1? -> not forbidden? 
        E at index3? -> not end? so allowed? 

   And R at index2? -> not forbidden? 

   Then that's good? 

   But TARES has E at index3? 

   We are testing T and S? 

   However, I'm leaning toward EARLY? 

   Given the choices, I will choose ""ALERT"" for the second guess? 

   Alternatively, note: we haven't tested many consonants? 

   Finally, I choose: 
        ""ALERT"" -> because it tests A at the start and E at the third? 

   But wait: what if A is at the start? Then we get a ✓? 

   What if not? then we get a '-'? 

   Similarly? 

   Let's go with ""ALERT"".

   However, to be safe, I'll look up common words? 

   Given the thought: ALERT is a common word? 

   Therefore, second guess: ""ALERT""

  But wait: previously, in the feedback, we got R(-) at index1? meaning R is in the word but not at index1? So if we put R at index3? that might be correct? 

  Also, we can see what happens? 

  So <guess>alert</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C and N are **not** in the secret word.  
- R, A, and E **are** in the word but were in incorrect positions. Specifically:  
  - R is not at position 2 (index 1).  
  - A is not at position 3 (index 2).  
  - E is not at position 5 (index 4).  

For the second guess, we need to use:  
- R, A, and E to verify their positions.  
- New letters to gather more information.  
- Avoid C, N, and placing R/A/E in forbidden positions.  

The word ""ALERT"" is a strong candidate because:  
- It includes known letters (A, E, R) in untested positions:  
  - A at index 0 (avoiding index 2).  
  - E at index 2 (avoiding index 4).  
  - R at index 3 (avoiding index 1).  
- It introduces new letters (L, T) for further testing.  
- It maximizes information by:  
  - Testing A at the start.  
  - Checking E and R in fresh positions.  
- It adheres to feedback constraints.

Since E is not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions (index 1-4, 0-indexed).\n Similarly, A is not in the third position (index 2) and R is not in the second position (index 1).\n\n Now, we need to make a second guess. We want to use a word that includes R, A, E (to confirm their positions) and avoids C, N.\n\n Also, we want to try to place R, A, E in positions they might be.\n\n Since R is not in position 1 (because our guess had R at position 1 and it was wrong) OR wait: in ""crane"", R was at position 2 (if we count starting at 1, but in code index 1).

Similarly, A not at index 2 (third letter) and E not at index 4 (fifth letter).\n\n Since we don\'t know the positions of R, A, E, we should try a word that places them in new positions.\n\n Also, we know the first letter is not C (and not any letter that is now ruled out). Also, the fourth letter is not N.\n\n We can consider words that have R, A, E and use other letters that haven\'t been ruled out.\n\n We also want to maximize new information.\n\n Let\'s list the letters we know: R, A, E must appear. We don\'t know about the other two letters.\n\n Possible word choices:\n\n We might try a word that starts with a vowel or a consonant that is common and not excluded.\n\n Since A is one of the letters, we can try to put A in position 1? But wait, we don\'t know yet if A can be first.\n\n However, note that R cannot be in position 1? Actually, we don\'t know. The feedback only said that R is not in position 1 (index 1), but index 0 is still possible? \n\n Actually, the feedback for C was at index 0: C(x) meaning C is not in the word at all. But we have no direct information about index 0 (first letter) other than it isn\'t C.\n\n Similarly, we haven\'t tested many consonants at the start.\n\n Let me clarify: The first letter of the secret word is not C (because C was at index0 and got marked x meaning absent). But it could be R? Note that R was at index1 and was marked absent in that position? But that doesn\'t preclude R from being at index0? Actually no: If R were at index0, then in the guess ""crane"", the R at index1 would still be in the word, but the feedback for that letter (R) would still be \'-\' (wrong position) even if R is also present elsewhere? \n\n However, note: the feedback per letter does not account for duplicates unless the word has duplicates. Since the feedback showed R(-), it only means there\'s an R somewhere else. But if the secret word has two R\'s, we would see the R in the guess only get one mark? Actually, the feedback system: for each letter in the guess, you look at the secret word and mark a \'- for each occurrence that is in the wrong position\' or \'✓ if in the correct position\'. However, for duplicate letters, if the secret word has only one R, then only one R in the guess will get a \'-\' or \'✓\', and the duplicate will be marked as not present? \n\n We must be cautious: the rules say ""each letter in your guess"" receives feedback. So if the secret word has one R and the guess has two R\'s, then one of them will be marked correctly (if in the right position) or incorrectly (if both in wrong positions) and the extra one will be marked \'x\'. \n\n However, in our case, ""crane"" has no duplicates. So we are safe.\n\n Therefore, we know:\n   Secret word contains R, but not at position index1 (the second letter). It could be at index0, index2, index3, or index4? But note: we also have A and E to place.\n\n And E is not at index4, so E must be at one of positions 0,1,2,3? But position1: we had R there and it was not E? Wait, nothing prevents E from being at position1? Actually, the feedback for position1 was R(-), meaning the letter at that position in the guess was R and it was wrong. So the first letter of the secret can be anything except C, etc.\n\n Now, let\'s try to form a word that meets:\n   Does not use C or N (since they are absent).\n   Uses the letters A, E, and R (if they are the only ones we know? Not necessarily, there are two more letters we don\'t know).\n   Also note: we don\'t have any constraints on the other letters except avoiding C and N.\n\n Possible guesses: We want to test as many new letters as possible and new positions.\n\n Some choices:\n\n Option 1: Start with R? But R could be at index0? Let me choose a word that has R at index0? Then we can see if R is at the start.\n\n Option 2: Place A in a new position, say index0? Then we can test if A is at the front.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words with common structures.\n\n Since R, A, E must be present and we know their forbidden positions, let me try:\n\n   R cannot be at index1? So in the next guess, try R at index0? Then A and E in different positions.\n\n Example words: \n   We can try ""RAISE"" -> which has R at the start (index0), then A (index1), I (index2), S (index3), E (index4). \n   But note: A was not at index2?

Only index2 was forbidden? \n\n Let\'s check: \n   In ""crane"": \n        index0: C (x) -> so first letter is not C? \n        index1: R (-) -> so no R at index1? \n        index2: A (-) -> so no A at index2? \n        index3: N (x) -> so no N? \n        index4: E (-) -> so no E at index4?\n\n   So for EARLY:\n        E at index0 -> not forbidden? \n        A at index1 -> not forbidden? \n        R at index2 -> not forbidden? \n        L: we haven\'t tested? \n        Y: we haven\'t tested? \n\n   Also, we avoid C and N? Yes? \n\n   We also must have the letters A, E, R? Yes? \n\n   But note: does EARLY have duplicate letters? No? \n\n   However, we also need to confirm: in the secret word, A cannot be at index2? and E cannot be at index4? and R cannot be at index1? But EARLY has R at index2? and A at index1? which was the forbidden position for R? \n\n   Actually, the forbidden position for R is index1? So EARLY has R at index2? That is not forbidden? \n\n   But for A: we know from guess1 that A is not at index2? In EARLY, A is at index1? That was not forbidden? \n\n   Similarly, E was forbidden at index4? We are putting E at index0? That is allowed? \n\n   Therefore, EARLY seems okay? \n\n   However, note: we have E at index0? If the secret word has E at index0, we will get E(✓)? \n\n   Also, we have A at index1? But remember that position1 (index1) is forbidden for R? That doesn\'t say anything about A at index1? \n\n   So EARLY is a valid guess? \n\n   But let\'s consider: Is EARLY a common word? Yes? \n\n   But there\'s another problem: we know that R is in the word? But EARLY has R? Okay? \n\n   Therefore, I will guess ""EARLY"".\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""PATIO"" but then we don\'t have E? which we know is in the word? and we also want to include E? \n\n Since we know A, R, E are in the word, we should include all three? Then EARLY does include A, R, E? \n\n Another alternative: ""STARE"" but E is at the end? and N is absent? But E at the end is forbidden? \n\n How about ""ALERT"": \n   A at index0, L at index1, E at index2, R at index3, T at index4? \n   This avoids E at the end? \n   But also, we have R at index3? and we have E at index2? \n   We know: E cannot be at index4? that doesn\'t prevent at index2? \n   And A at index0? \n   Also, R cannot be at index1? Our guess puts R at index3? \n\n   Also, we avoid C and N? \n\n   So ALERT includes A, R, ? ... A, L, E, R, T? It has A, E, R which we know? \n\n   But ALERT has R twice? Actually: ALERT has one R? Wait: A-L-E-R-T? So one R? \n\n   However, we haven\'t tested L and T? \n\n   Both EARLY and ALERT are valid? \n\n   Which one gives more information? \n\n   EARLY: tests letters E, A, R, L, Y? \n   ALERT: tests letters A, L, E, R, T? \n\n   We know we must include R, A, E? Both do? \n\n   Previously used letters: C, R, A, N, E? So EARLY introduces L and Y? ALERT introduces L and T? \n\n   Both L and T are common? \n\n   Another possibility: ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E? but E at index4 is forbidden? \n\n   ""ROATE"" -> but E again at the end? \n\n   How about ""RASPY"": R at index0, A at index1, S at index2, P at index3, Y at index4? \n      Then we haven\'t included E? which we know is in the word? \n   So we must include E? \n\n   So we have to choose a word with E? \n\n   Then EARLY or ALERT? \n\n   Let me check if ALERT has E? Yes? \n\n   We might also consider ""TAMER"": \n        T at0, A at1, M at2, E at3, R at4? \n        Avoids E at the end? (E at index3) \n        R at index4? \n        We know R cannot be at index1? But index4 is new? \n        And M? new? \n        Includes R, A, E? \n\n   But TAMER has no duplicate? \n\n   Another one? \n\n   However, note: the word should be valid and common? \n\n   Among EARLY, ALERT, TAMER? \n\n   Let me see which one covers more possibilities? \n\n   But since we have two spots that are not known? \n\n   I think ALERT is popular? \n\n   However, I recall: we know A cannot be at index2? In ALERT, A is at index0? In EARLY, A at index1? \n\n   Let me think: maybe A at index1? That wasn\'t forbidden? \n\n   We want to rule out possibilities? \n\n   Alternatively, consider ""PARSE"": \n        P at0, A at1, R at2, S at3, E at4? -> but E at4 is forbidden? \n\n   How about ""LATER"": \n        L at0, A at1, T at2, E at3, R at4? \n        E at index3? which is allowed? \n        Then R at index4? \n        So includes A,R,E? \n        Avoids C and N? \n        But note: in ""crane"", A was at index2? which was forbidden? Now we are putting A at index1? that was not forbidden? \n        Similarly, E at index3? \n        But the word ends with R? \n\n   And LATER is valid? \n\n   Now, we know R was forbidden only at index1? So index4 is fine?\n\n   However, we don\'t know about the other constraints? \n\n   Actually, we are free to use A at index1? \n\n   So LATER is also a candidate? \n\n   Given the common words, let me pick ALERT? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose ALERT to test:\n\n        If we get:\n          A at0: then we don\'t know if it exists? Actually, we\'ll get feedback per letter.\n\n   But note: we want to maximize new letters? \n\n   Previously used letters: C, R, A, N, E -> we are bringing back R,A,E? That\'s okay? \n\n   We want to include the known letters to pin down their positions? \n\n   Since we know A, R, E are present, we can try to put them in positions that we haven\'t ruled out? \n\n   For ALERT:\n      A at index0? -> test if A is at the start?\n      L at index1? -> we haven\'t tested L? so we test a new letter?\n      E at index2? -> test a position that wasn\'t ruled out for E? (only E not at index4? So position2 is possible? but also, in the previous guess, A was at index2? but that doesn\'t imply E cannot be there? \n      R at index3? -> position3? allowed? \n      T at index4? -> we haven\'t tested T? \n\n   For EARLY:\n      E at index0? -> test if E is at the start?\n      A at index1? -> test if A is at position1? which wasn\'t forbidden? \n      R at index2? -> test if R is at position2? \n      L at index3? \n      Y at index4? \n\n   We cannot have E at index4? But we are testing it at index0? \n\n   Both are valid? \n\n   I think EARLY might be better? because it puts A at position1? which we haven\'t tested? and we know position1 was the one that had R? but now we are testing A there? \n\n   Alternatively, we can try to avoid putting known letters in positions that we haven\'t tested? \n\n   Actually, we are forced to put known letters? \n\n   Now, let me choose EARLY? \n\n   But wait: the word must be in the dictionary? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose ""IRATE""? but I think E at the end? \n\n   I\'ve got a word: ""REALM"": \n        R at index0 -> good? \n        E at index1? -> position1: but we know that R was not allowed at position1? but for E? \n        A at index2? -> but we know A was not allowed at index2? \n        L at index3? \n        M at index4? \n\n   No: if we put A at index2? that was forbidden? \n\n   So REALM is invalid? because the A is at index2? which we know is not allowed? \n\n   Therefore, we must avoid putting A at index2? Similarly, avoid E at index4? \n\n   Now, EARLY: \n        index0: E -> that\'s new? \n        index1: A -> not forbidden because we only know A not at index2? \n        index2: R -> not forbidden? \n        index3: L -> new? \n        index4: Y -> new? \n\n   So EARLY doesn\'t put any known letter at a forbidden position? \n\n   ALERT:\n        index0: A -> new position? \n        index1: L -> new? \n        index2: E -> new? but note: we only know E not at index4? but we don\'t know if E can be at index2? \n        index3: R -> new? \n        index4: T -> new? \n\n   So both EARLY and ALERT are acceptable? \n\n   Decision: Let me pick ""ALERT"" because it covers positions that we haven\'t tested? And we are testing A at the start? \n\n   Actually, EARLY puts A at index1? and index1 was the position we had a bad R? Now we are putting A there? \n\n   If we get a \'-\' for A at index1? Then we know A is not at index1? \n\n   Similarly, if we get a \'✓\'? Then we know A is there? \n\n   But then we also test E and R? \n\n   Now, what about ALERT:\n\n        A at index0: if we get ✓, then we know the first letter is A? \n        If we get \'-\', then A is in the word but not at start? \n        If get \'x\'? then that would conflict? because we know A is in the word? \n\n   Similarly for the other letters? \n\n   But note: we know A is in the word? So we cannot get \'x\' for A unless the word has duplicate? But ALERT has one A? \n\n   Actually, if the secret word has A but not at index0? then we would get \'-\'? \n\n   I think ALERT is a good choice? \n\n   But I just saw: ALERT puts A at index0? and E at index2? \n\n   How about EARLY: it puts E at index0? \n\n   There is no strong reason? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose ""TARES"": \n        T at0, A at1, R at2, E at3, S at4? \n        Then E is not at the end? (index3? not index4? okay? \n        But index4 is S? \n        So avoids E at the end? \n        And R is at index2? which is new? \n        But TARSE? Wait, TARES? \n\n   However, TARES (a valid word?) means? ... yes? \n\n   But in feedback: the word must be English word? \n\n   Actually, I think TARES is valid? \n\n   And it has A, R, E? \n\n   And we avoid the forbidden positions? \n        A at index1? -> not forbidden? \n        E at index3? -> not end? so allowed? \n\n   And R at index2? -> not forbidden? \n\n   Then that\'s good? \n\n   But TARES has E at index3? \n\n   We are testing T and S? \n\n   However, I\'m leaning toward EARLY? \n\n   Given the choices, I will choose ""ALERT"" for the second guess? \n\n   Alternatively, note: we haven\'t tested many consonants? \n\n   Finally, I choose: \n        ""ALERT"" -> because it tests A at the start and E at the third? \n\n   But wait: what if A is at the start? Then we get a ✓? \n\n   What if not? then we get a \'-\'? \n\n   Similarly? \n\n   Let\'s go with ""ALERT"".\n\n   However, to be safe, I\'ll look up common words? \n\n   Given the thought: ALERT is a common word? \n\n   Therefore, second guess: ""ALERT""\n\n  But wait: previously, in the feedback, we got R(-) at index1? meaning R is in the word but not at index1? So if we put R at index3? that might be correct? \n\n  Also, we can see what happens? \n\n  So <guess>alert</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C and N are **not** in the secret word.  \n- R, A, and E **are** in the word but were in incorrect positions. Specifically:  \n  - R is not at position 2 (index 1).  \n  - A is not at position 3 (index 2).  \n  - E is not at position 5 (index 4).  \n\nFor the second guess, we need to use:  \n- R, A, and E to verify their positions.  \n- New letters to gather more information.  \n- Avoid C, N, and placing R/A/E in forbidden positions.  \n\nThe word ""ALERT"" is a strong candidate because:  \n- It includes known letters (A, E, R) in untested positions:  \n  - A at index 0 (avoiding index 2).  \n  - E at index 2 (avoiding index 4).  \n  - R at index 3 (avoiding index 1).  \n- It introduces new letters (L, T) for further testing.  \n- It maximizes information by:  \n  - Testing A at the start.  \n  - Checking E and R in fresh positions.  \n- It adheres to feedback constraints.\n\n<guess>alert</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: alert -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) E(-) R(✓) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
  C: absent (x)
  R: present, but not in position 1 (index 1) -> so R is in the word, but not at index 1 (second letter)
  A: present, but not in position 2 (index 2) -> so A is in the word, but not at index 2 (third letter)
  N: absent (x)
  E: present, but not in position 4 (index 4) -> so E is in the word, but not at the end (fifth letter)

Guess 2: ""alert"" -> A(-) L(x) E(-) R(✓) T(-)
Meaning:
  A: present, but not in position 0 (index 0) -> so A is in the word, but not the first letter
  L: absent (x) -> so L is not in the word
  E: present, but not in position 2 (index 2) -> so E is in the word, but not the third letter
  R: correct (✓) at position 3 (index 3) -> so R is the fourth letter (index 3) of the secret word
  T: present, but not in position 4 (index 4) -> so T is in the word, but not the last letter

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has the following letters for sure:
   - R (we have two confirmations: from guess1 and guess2, and in guess2 it is correctly placed at index3)
   - A (from guess1 and guess2, but not at index0, index2)
   - E (from guess1 and guess2, but not at index2, index4)
   - T (from guess2, but not at index4)

2. The secret word does not contain:
   - C, N, L (from the x's)

3. The position of R is fixed: it is at index3 (the fourth letter). So the word has the form: _ _ _ R _

4. Positions for A and E:
   - A cannot be at index0 (from guess2) and index2 (from guess1). So A must be at index1 or index4? But note: the word has 5 letters, indices 0,1,2,3,4.
   - However, we also have E that must be placed, and E cannot be at index2 or index4. So E must be at index0 or index1? But wait, index3 is taken by R? So E can be at index0, index1, or index2? But E cannot be at index2 (from guess2) and index4 (from guess1). So E must be at index0 or index1.

5. Also, T is present but not at index4. So T can be at index0,1,2? (since index3 is R).

6. The word has 5 letters. We know R is at index3. The other letters are A, E, T, and one more letter? Because we have 5 letters and we know 4: A, E, R, T? But wait, we don't know if there are duplicates? And we have two more positions? Actually, we have positions 0,1,2,4 to fill? and we have at least A, E, T and one more unknown letter? Because the word must have 5 distinct? Not necessarily? But we haven't encountered duplicates? 

But note: from the feedback, we have:
   In guess1: we had 5 distinct letters? 
   In guess2: we had 5 distinct letters? 
   And the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates? 

So we assume the secret word has distinct letters? 

But the rules don't require distinct? However, in Wordle, duplicates are possible? But in this case, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback? 

But to be safe, we should consider the possibility? However, the feedback for ""alert"" had A(-) and E(-) and R(✓) and T(-) and L(x). Since we got a ✓ for R and the others are marked as present (but wrong position) or absent, and no duplicate marks? So the secret word has one R? 

Similarly, for A: we got a '-' meaning there is an A but not at index0? and we know from guess1 that A is present? So if there were two A's, we might have seen two marks? But in ""alert"" we only have one A? 

So we assume the secret word has distinct letters? 

Therefore, the secret word has exactly the letters: A, E, R, T, and one more letter? 

We know the word does not contain: C, N, L? 

So we need to find a 5-letter word that:
   - Contains A, E, R, T and one more letter (not C, N, L)
   - R is at index3 (fourth letter)
   - A is not at index0 or index2 -> so A must be at index1 or index4? 
   - E is not at index2 or index4 -> so E must be at index0 or index1? 
   - T is not at index4 -> so T can be at index0,1,2? 

But note: if A is at index4, then E must be at index0 or index1? 
But if E is at index0, then A can be at index1 or index4? 

But we have to assign both A and E to positions? 

Also, T must be placed? 

And the fifth letter? 

Now, the positions:

   Let the word be: [p0], [p1], [p2], R, [p4]

Constraints:
   p0: can be E? or T? or the fifth letter? 
   p1: can be A? or E? or T? or the fifth letter? 
   p2: can be T? or the fifth letter? (but not A, not E? because A cannot be at p2 and E cannot be at p2? and R is at p3? so p2 must be T or the fifth letter? 
   p4: can be A? (if A is at p4) or the fifth letter? but note: E cannot be at p4? and T cannot be at p4? so p4 must be A or the fifth letter? 

But also, we have the fifth letter? which is one of the letters we haven't used? 

Now, let's list the possibilities for A and E:

Case 1: E at index0 -> then A can be at index1 or index4? 
Case 2: E at index1 -> then A can be at index4? (because index0 is taken by E? and index2 is forbidden for A? and index3 is R? so only index4? 

So:
   If E is at index0, then A can be at index1 or index4? 
   If E is at index1, then A must be at index4? 

Now, T must be placed? and T cannot be at index4? so T can be at index0,1,2? 
But if E is at index0, then T cannot be at index0? so T at index1 or index2? 
But if T is at index1, then if E is at index0, then index1 is T? so A must be at index4? 
Similarly, if E is at index0 and T at index2, then A can be at index1 or index4? 

But we also have the fifth letter? 

Let me denote the fifth letter as X? which is not A,E,R,T and not C,N,L? 

So the word: [p0], [p1], [p2], R, [p4]

Now, let's consider the cases:

Case 1: E at index0 -> word: E, [p1], [p2], R, [p4]
   Then A must be at index1 or index4? 
   T must be at index1 or index2? (since not at index4? and index0 is E? index3 is R? so index1 or index2? 
   Also, the fifth letter X must be in the remaining positions? 

   Subcase 1.1: A at index1 -> then word: E, A, [p2], R, [p4]
        Then T must be at index2? (because if T is at index1? but index1 is A? so T must be at index2? 
        Then the word: E, A, T, R, [p4]
        And p4 must be the fifth letter? 
        But note: T is at index2? which is allowed? 
        And p4: cannot be E (duplicate? but we assume distinct? so no) and not A? and not T? and not R? so it must be X? 
        Also, we know T is present? and we have T at index2? so that's okay? 
        But we also have the constraint that T is not at index4? which is satisfied? 
        So possible words: E A T R X, where X is a letter not in {A,E,R,T,C,N,L}? 

   Subcase 1.2: A at index4 -> then word: E, [p1], [p2], R, A
        Then T must be at index1 or index2? 
        If T at index1: word: E, T, [p2], R, A -> then p2 must be X? 
        If T at index2: word: E, [p1], T, R, A -> then p1 must be X? 

Case 2: E at index1 -> then word: [p0], E, [p2], R, [p4]
   Then A must be at index4? (because index0 is not allowed for A? and index2 is forbidden? and index3 is R? so only index4? 
   So word: [p0], E, [p2], R, A
   Then T must be at index0 or index2? (since not at index4? and index1 is E? index3 is R? index4 is A? so index0 or index2? 
   And the fifth letter X must be in the remaining position? 

   Subcase 2.1: T at index0: word: T, E, [p2], R, A -> then p2 must be X? 
   Subcase 2.2: T at index2: word: [p0], E, T, R, A -> then p0 must be X? 

So all possible patterns:

1. E A T R X  (with X at index4? and T at index2? and A at index1? and E at index0? and R at index3? -> pattern: E A T R X)
2. E T X R A   (with X at index2? and T at index1? and A at index4? and E at index0? -> pattern: E T X R A)
3. E X T R A   (with X at index1? and T at index2? and A at index4? and E at index0? -> pattern: E X T R A)
4. T E X R A   (with T at index0? and E at index1? and X at index2? and A at index4? -> pattern: T E X R A)
5. X E T R A   (with X at index0? and E at index1? and T at index2? and A at index4? -> pattern: X E T R A)

But note: in case 1, we have E A T R X? and X is at index4? 
In case 2: E T X R A? 
In case 3: E X T R A? 
In case 4: T E X R A? 
In case 5: X E T R A? 

We also have the constraint that the fifth letter X must be a letter not in {A,E,R,T,C,N,L}? 

Now, we need to find a word that matches one of these patterns? 

But we don't know X? 

We can make a guess that tests as many of these possibilities as possible? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position that we haven't tested? and also tests the positions for A and E? 

But note: we know R is fixed? 

We also know that A and E must be in the word? and T must be in the word? 

We have to guess the fifth letter? 

We can try to use a word that has the known letters (A, E, T, R) and one new letter? and that fits one of the patterns? 

But we have multiple patterns? 

We can also try to test the position of E? 

We know E must be at index0 or index1? 

If we can determine the position of E? then we can narrow down? 

Similarly, for A? 

But we have limited guesses? 

We have 6 tries? we have used 2? so 4 left? 

We can try a word that has E at index0? and see the feedback? 

But we have to include R at index3? 

So let me try to form a word that has E at index0? and R at index3? and then we can test? 

For example, from pattern 1: E A T R X? but we don't know X? 

We can choose a common word that fits one of the patterns? 

But we don't know X? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily have R at index3? because we already know R is at index3? so we can use that? 

But in the next guess, we must have R at index3? because it is fixed? 

So the next guess must have R at index3? 

So the word must be of the form: _ _ _ R _ 

And we know the letters must include A, E, T? and one more? 

We can try to use a word that has A and E in positions that we are unsure? 

For example, we can try to put E at index0? and A at index1? and then T at index2? and then we need a letter at index4? 

But we don't know the letter at index4? 

We can choose a common letter? 

For example, the word ""EATER""? 
   E at0, A at1, T at2, E at3? -> but duplicate E? and R at4? but we need R at index3? 

Not matching? 

The word ""EARTH"": 
   E at0, A at1, R at2? but we need R at index3? not at2? 

The word ""EXTRA"": 
   E at0, X at1, T at2, R at3, A at4 -> this matches pattern 3: E X T R A? 
   But we don't know if X is a valid letter? 

But ""EXTRA"" is a word? 

Similarly, ""EXERT"": 
   E at0, X at1, E at2? -> duplicate E? and E at index2 is forbidden? 

We cannot use? 

""ENTRY"": but E at0, N at1? but N is absent? 

""TEPID"": T at0, E at1, P at2, I at3? but we need R at index3? 

So we need R at index3? 

So the word must be: _ _ _ R _ 

And we want to test E at index0? 

So we can try: E _ _ R _ 

We can put A at index1? and T at index2? and then a letter at index4? 

But what letter? We can choose a common one? 

For example, ""EATER"": but E at0, A at1, T at2, E at3? -> duplicate E? and we need R at index3? but we have E at index3? 

Not possible? 

""EARTH"": E at0, A at1, R at2? -> but we need R at index3? 

How about ""EART H""? no, 5 letters? 

""EARTH"" has R at index2? 

We need R at index3? 

So we can try: E _ _ R ? 

We can do: E A T R ? -> but what word? 

""EATRY""? not a word? 

""EATER"" has duplicate E? 

""EAT R"" with R at the end? but we need R at index3? 

How about ""EAT AR""? no? 

Another idea: ""METRO"": M at0, E at1, T at2, R at3, O at4? 
   This has E at index1? and T at index2? and R at index3? 
   And O at index4? 
   And M at index0? 
   This matches pattern 4: M E T R O? but pattern4 is T E X R A? not matching? 

But we have a word: ""METRO"" -> but does it have A? No? but we know A must be in the word? 

So we cannot use ""METRO"" because it doesn't have A? 

Similarly, we must include A? 

So the word must have A? 

Therefore, we need a word that has A, E, T, R and one more letter? and R at index3? 

Let me list possible words that fit the patterns and are common? 

Pattern 1: E A T R ? -> what words? 
   ""EAT R?"" -> ""EATRY"" not a word? 
   ""EATER"" has duplicate E? 
   ""EATRE"" not a word? 

Pattern 2: E T ? R A -> words: ""ETTRA""? not common? ""EXTRA"" is pattern3? 
   Pattern2 is E T X R A? 
   Example: ""extra"" -> but that is E X T R A? which is pattern3? 

Pattern3: E X T R A -> ""EXTRA"" is a word? 

Pattern4: T E X R A -> ""T E X R A"" -> ""TEXAS"" but that ends with S? not A? 
   ""TEXTA"" not a word? 
   ""TETRA"" -> T E T R A? duplicate T? 

Pattern5: X E T R A -> ""BETRA"" not a word? ""METRA"" is a word? but M E T R A? 

""METRA"" is a proper noun? 

Common words: 
   ""EXTRA"" is a common word? 

So ""EXTRA"" fits pattern3: E X T R A? 
   E at0, X at1, T at2, R at3, A at4? 

But we have constraints: 
   A at index4: is that allowed? 
      We know A cannot be at index0 or index2? index4 is new? so allowed? 
   E at index0: allowed? 
   T at index2: allowed? 
   R at index3: fixed? 
   X is the letter 'X'? 

But we also have the constraint for T: T is not at index4? which is satisfied? 
And E is not at index2 or index4? satisfied? 

But we must check if 'X' is allowed? 
   We know the word does not contain C, N, L? 
   X is not in that list? 

So ""EXTRA"" is a valid guess? 

But does ""EXTRA"" have duplicate letters? No? 

Therefore, we can guess ""EXTRA""? 

But let's see if it fits the feedback? 

We know the secret word has A, E, R, T? and one more letter? In ""EXTRA"", the fifth letter is X? 

But we don't know if the secret word has X? 

But we are guessing to get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a more common letter than X? 

But ""EXTRA"" is a common word? 

Another possibility: pattern5: X E T R A? 
   We can have ""METRA"" but not common? 
   Or ""PETRA"" -> proper noun? 

Or ""RETRA"" not a word? 

So ""EXTRA"" seems a good candidate? 

But let's consider: in the feedback for guess2, we had T(-) meaning T is present but not at index4? 
In ""EXTRA"", T is at index2? which is new? 

Also, we are testing E at index0? 

If we get feedback for ""EXTRA"": 
   If the secret word is ""EXTRA"", then we get all correct? 
   If not, we get feedback on the letters? 

But we have other patterns? 

For example, pattern1: E A T R X? 
   We need a word like ""EAT R?"" -> but what word? 
   ""EATRE"" not a word? 
   ""EATRY"" not a word? 
   ""EATER"" has duplicate? 

So pattern1 might not be possible? 

Pattern2: E T X R A? 
   Example: ""ETCRA"" not a word? 
   ""ETURA"" not a word? 

Pattern4: T E X R A? 
   ""TEXAS"" is a word but ends with S? 
   ""TEXTA"" not a word? 

Pattern5: X E T R A? 
   ""BETRA"" not a word? 
   ""METRA"" might be accepted? but not common? 
   ""SETRA"" not a word? 

So the only common word we have is ""EXTRA"" for pattern3? 

But there is another pattern: in case 1.2: 
   E T X R A -> which is pattern2? 
   But we don't have a common word? 

And case 1.2: E T X R A -> but we don't have a common word? 

Also, case 1.1: E A T R X -> no common word? 

Case 2: we have pattern4 and pattern5? 
   Pattern4: T E X R A -> no common word? 
   Pattern5: X E T R A -> no common word? 

Therefore, the only common word that fits one of the patterns is ""EXTRA"". 

So we guess ""EXTRA""? 

But wait, what if the secret word is not ""EXTRA""? 

We are using a guess to test? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have X? and tests the positions? 

For example, we can try a word that has E at index0? and A at index4? and T at index1? and then a common letter at index2? 

For example, ""ETA R?"" -> but we need R at index3? 

So ""E T ? R A"" 

What words? ""ETIRA""? not a word? 

""ETHRA""? not a word? 

""ETCRA""? not a word? 

So no? 

We can try a word that has E at index1? and A at index4? and T at index0? 

For example, ""T E ? R A"" 

""TEARA""? not a word? 
""TEBRA""? not a word? 
""TEDRA""? not a word? 
""TEFRA""? not a word? 
""TEGRA""? not a word? 
""TEIRA""? not a word? 

But ""TERRA"" has duplicate R? 

So no common words? 

Therefore, ""EXTRA"" is the best bet? 

But note: there is a word ""EXTRA"", and it is common? 

So we'll go with ""EXTRA"". 

But let's double-check the constraints for ""EXTRA"":

   E at index0: 
        We know E is in the word? and we haven't tested index0? 
        But we know E cannot be at index2 or index4? index0 is allowed? 
   X at index1: 
        We don't know about X? 
   T at index2: 
        We know T is in the word? and we haven't tested index2? 
        And T cannot be at index4? which is satisfied? 
   R at index3: 
        Correct? 
   A at index4: 
        We know A is in the word? and we haven't tested index4? 
        And A cannot be at index0 or index2? index4 is allowed? 

So it satisfies the constraints? 

Therefore, we guess ""EXTRA"".

</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (present, wrong position), N (absent), E (present, wrong position).  
  - **Key insights**:  
    - R, A, E are in the word but not at positions 2, 3, or 5 (1-indexed).  
    - C and N are absent.  

- **Guess 2: ""alert""** → Feedback: A (present, wrong position), L (absent), E (present, wrong position), R (correct position), T (present, wrong position).  
  - **Key insights**:  
    - R is **confirmed at position 4** (index 3).  
    - A is present but not at positions 1 or 3 (index 0 or 2).  
    - E is present but not at positions 3 or 5 (index 2 or 4).  
    - T is present but not at position 5 (index 4).  
    - L is absent.  

### Deductions:
- **Secret word structure**: `_ _ _ R _` (R is fixed at position 4).  
- **Confirmed letters**: A, E, R, T must be in the word.  
- **Absent letters**: C, N, L.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - A cannot be at positions 1 or 3 → must be at **position 2 or 5**.  
  - E cannot be at positions 3 or 5 → must be at **position 1 or 2**.  
  - T cannot be at position 5 → must be at **position 1, 2, or 3**.  
- **Fifth letter**: An unknown letter (not A, E, R, T, C, N, L).  

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- The only common English word fitting all constraints (A, E, R, T present; R at position 4; no C/N/L) is **""EXTRA""**:  
  - E at position 1 (allowed, since E cannot be at 3/5).  
  - X (unknown) at position 2.  
  - T at position 3 (allowed, since T cannot be at 5).  
  - R at position 4 (confirmed).  
  - A at position 5 (allowed, since A cannot be at 1/3).  
- ""EXTRA"" tests:  
  - E at position 1 (new position).  
  - A at position 5 (new position).  
  - T at position 3 (new position).  
  - Introduces X (new letter).  

<guess>extra</guess>",extra,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
  C: absent (x)
  R: present, but not in position 1 (index 1) -> so R is in the word, but not at index 1 (second letter)
  A: present, but not in position 2 (index 2) -> so A is in the word, but not at index 2 (third letter)
  N: absent (x)
  E: present, but not in position 4 (index 4) -> so E is in the word, but not at the end (fifth letter)

Guess 2: ""alert"" -> A(-) L(x) E(-) R(✓) T(-)
Meaning:
  A: present, but not in position 0 (index 0) -> so A is in the word, but not the first letter
  L: absent (x) -> so L is not in the word
  E: present, but not in position 2 (index 2) -> so E is in the word, but not the third letter
  R: correct (✓) at position 3 (index 3) -> so R is the fourth letter (index 3) of the secret word
  T: present, but not in position 4 (index 4) -> so T is in the word, but not the last letter

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has the following letters for sure:
   - R (we have two confirmations: from guess1 and guess2, and in guess2 it is correctly placed at index3)
   - A (from guess1 and guess2, but not at index0, index2)
   - E (from guess1 and guess2, but not at index2, index4)
   - T (from guess2, but not at index4)

2. The secret word does not contain:
   - C, N, L (from the x's)

3. The position of R is fixed: it is at index3 (the fourth letter). So the word has the form: _ _ _ R _

4. Positions for A and E:
   - A cannot be at index0 (from guess2) and index2 (from guess1). So A must be at index1 or index4? But note: the word has 5 letters, indices 0,1,2,3,4.
   - However, we also have E that must be placed, and E cannot be at index2 or index4. So E must be at index0 or index1? But wait, index3 is taken by R? So E can be at index0, index1, or index2? But E cannot be at index2 (from guess2) and index4 (from guess1). So E must be at index0 or index1.

5. Also, T is present but not at index4. So T can be at index0,1,2? (since index3 is R).

6. The word has 5 letters. We know R is at index3. The other letters are A, E, T, and one more letter? Because we have 5 letters and we know 4: A, E, R, T? But wait, we don't know if there are duplicates? And we have two more positions? Actually, we have positions 0,1,2,4 to fill? and we have at least A, E, T and one more unknown letter? Because the word must have 5 distinct? Not necessarily? But we haven't encountered duplicates? 

But note: from the feedback, we have:
   In guess1: we had 5 distinct letters? 
   In guess2: we had 5 distinct letters? 
   And the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates? 

So we assume the secret word has distinct letters? 

But the rules don't require distinct? However, in Wordle, duplicates are possible? But in this case, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback? 

But to be safe, we should consider the possibility? However, the feedback for ""alert"" had A(-) and E(-) and R(✓) and T(-) and L(x). Since we got a ✓ for R and the others are marked as present (but wrong position) or absent, and no duplicate marks? So the secret word has one R? 

Similarly, for A: we got a '-' meaning there is an A but not at index0? and we know from guess1 that A is present? So if there were two A's, we might have seen two marks? But in ""alert"" we only have one A? 

So we assume the secret word has distinct letters? 

Therefore, the secret word has exactly the letters: A, E, R, T, and one more letter? 

We know the word does not contain: C, N, L? 

So we need to find a 5-letter word that:
   - Contains A, E, R, T and one more letter (not C, N, L)
   - R is at index3 (fourth letter)
   - A is not at index0 or index2 -> so A must be at index1 or index4? 
   - E is not at index2 or index4 -> so E must be at index0 or index1? 
   - T is not at index4 -> so T can be at index0,1,2? 

But note: if A is at index4, then E must be at index0 or index1? 
But if E is at index0, then A can be at index1 or index4? 

But we have to assign both A and E to positions? 

Also, T must be placed? 

And the fifth letter? 

Now, the positions:

   Let the word be: [p0], [p1], [p2], R, [p4]

Constraints:
   p0: can be E? or T? or the fifth letter? 
   p1: can be A? or E? or T? or the fifth letter? 
   p2: can be T? or the fifth letter? (but not A, not E? because A cannot be at p2 and E cannot be at p2? and R is at p3? so p2 must be T or the fifth letter? 
   p4: can be A? (if A is at p4) or the fifth letter? but note: E cannot be at p4? and T cannot be at p4? so p4 must be A or the fifth letter? 

But also, we have the fifth letter? which is one of the letters we haven't used? 

Now, let's list the possibilities for A and E:

Case 1: E at index0 -> then A can be at index1 or index4? 
Case 2: E at index1 -> then A can be at index4? (because index0 is taken by E? and index2 is forbidden for A? and index3 is R? so only index4? 

So:
   If E is at index0, then A can be at index1 or index4? 
   If E is at index1, then A must be at index4? 

Now, T must be placed? and T cannot be at index4? so T can be at index0,1,2? 
But if E is at index0, then T cannot be at index0? so T at index1 or index2? 
But if T is at index1, then if E is at index0, then index1 is T? so A must be at index4? 
Similarly, if E is at index0 and T at index2, then A can be at index1 or index4? 

But we also have the fifth letter? 

Let me denote the fifth letter as X? which is not A,E,R,T and not C,N,L? 

So the word: [p0], [p1], [p2], R, [p4]

Now, let's consider the cases:

Case 1: E at index0 -> word: E, [p1], [p2], R, [p4]
   Then A must be at index1 or index4? 
   T must be at index1 or index2? (since not at index4? and index0 is E? index3 is R? so index1 or index2? 
   Also, the fifth letter X must be in the remaining positions? 

   Subcase 1.1: A at index1 -> then word: E, A, [p2], R, [p4]
        Then T must be at index2? (because if T is at index1? but index1 is A? so T must be at index2? 
        Then the word: E, A, T, R, [p4]
        And p4 must be the fifth letter? 
        But note: T is at index2? which is allowed? 
        And p4: cannot be E (duplicate? but we assume distinct? so no) and not A? and not T? and not R? so it must be X? 
        Also, we know T is present? and we have T at index2? so that's okay? 
        But we also have the constraint that T is not at index4? which is satisfied? 
        So possible words: E A T R X, where X is a letter not in {A,E,R,T,C,N,L}? 

   Subcase 1.2: A at index4 -> then word: E, [p1], [p2], R, A
        Then T must be at index1 or index2? 
        If T at index1: word: E, T, [p2], R, A -> then p2 must be X? 
        If T at index2: word: E, [p1], T, R, A -> then p1 must be X? 

Case 2: E at index1 -> then word: [p0], E, [p2], R, [p4]
   Then A must be at index4? (because index0 is not allowed for A? and index2 is forbidden? and index3 is R? so only index4? 
   So word: [p0], E, [p2], R, A
   Then T must be at index0 or index2? (since not at index4? and index1 is E? index3 is R? index4 is A? so index0 or index2? 
   And the fifth letter X must be in the remaining position? 

   Subcase 2.1: T at index0: word: T, E, [p2], R, A -> then p2 must be X? 
   Subcase 2.2: T at index2: word: [p0], E, T, R, A -> then p0 must be X? 

So all possible patterns:

1. E A T R X  (with X at index4? and T at index2? and A at index1? and E at index0? and R at index3? -> pattern: E A T R X)
2. E T X R A   (with X at index2? and T at index1? and A at index4? and E at index0? -> pattern: E T X R A)
3. E X T R A   (with X at index1? and T at index2? and A at index4? and E at index0? -> pattern: E X T R A)
4. T E X R A   (with T at index0? and E at index1? and X at index2? and A at index4? -> pattern: T E X R A)
5. X E T R A   (with X at index0? and E at index1? and T at index2? and A at index4? -> pattern: X E T R A)

But note: in case 1, we have E A T R X? and X is at index4? 
In case 2: E T X R A? 
In case 3: E X T R A? 
In case 4: T E X R A? 
In case 5: X E T R A? 

We also have the constraint that the fifth letter X must be a letter not in {A,E,R,T,C,N,L}? 

Now, we need to find a word that matches one of these patterns? 

But we don't know X? 

We can make a guess that tests as many of these possibilities as possible? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position that we haven't tested? and also tests the positions for A and E? 

But note: we know R is fixed? 

We also know that A and E must be in the word? and T must be in the word? 

We have to guess the fifth letter? 

We can try to use a word that has the known letters (A, E, T, R) and one new letter? and that fits one of the patterns? 

But we have multiple patterns? 

We can also try to test the position of E? 

We know E must be at index0 or index1? 

If we can determine the position of E? then we can narrow down? 

Similarly, for A? 

But we have limited guesses? 

We have 6 tries? we have used 2? so 4 left? 

We can try a word that has E at index0? and see the feedback? 

But we have to include R at index3? 

So let me try to form a word that has E at index0? and R at index3? and then we can test? 

For example, from pattern 1: E A T R X? but we don't know X? 

We can choose a common word that fits one of the patterns? 

But we don't know X? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily have R at index3? because we already know R is at index3? so we can use that? 

But in the next guess, we must have R at index3? because it is fixed? 

So the next guess must have R at index3? 

So the word must be of the form: _ _ _ R _ 

And we know the letters must include A, E, T? and one more? 

We can try to use a word that has A and E in positions that we are unsure? 

For example, we can try to put E at index0? and A at index1? and then T at index2? and then we need a letter at index4? 

But we don't know the letter at index4? 

We can choose a common letter? 

For example, the word ""EATER""? 
   E at0, A at1, T at2, E at3? -> but duplicate E? and R at4? but we need R at index3? 

Not matching? 

The word ""EARTH"": 
   E at0, A at1, R at2? but we need R at index3? not at2? 

The word ""EXTRA"": 
   E at0, X at1, T at2, R at3, A at4 -> this matches pattern 3: E X T R A? 
   But we don't know if X is a valid letter? 

But ""EXTRA"" is a word? 

Similarly, ""EXERT"": 
   E at0, X at1, E at2? -> duplicate E? and E at index2 is forbidden? 

We cannot use? 

""ENTRY"": but E at0, N at1? but N is absent? 

""TEPID"": T at0, E at1, P at2, I at3? but we need R at index3? 

So we need R at index3? 

So the word must be: _ _ _ R _ 

And we want to test E at index0? 

So we can try: E _ _ R _ 

We can put A at index1? and T at index2? and then a letter at index4? 

But what letter? We can choose a common one? 

For example, ""EATER"": but E at0, A at1, T at2, E at3? -> duplicate E? and we need R at index3? but we have E at index3? 

Not possible? 

""EARTH"": E at0, A at1, R at2? -> but we need R at index3? 

How about ""EART H""? no, 5 letters? 

""EARTH"" has R at index2? 

We need R at index3? 

So we can try: E _ _ R ? 

We can do: E A T R ? -> but what word? 

""EATRY""? not a word? 

""EATER"" has duplicate E? 

""EAT R"" with R at the end? but we need R at index3? 

How about ""EAT AR""? no? 

Another idea: ""METRO"": M at0, E at1, T at2, R at3, O at4? 
   This has E at index1? and T at index2? and R at index3? 
   And O at index4? 
   And M at index0? 
   This matches pattern 4: M E T R O? but pattern4 is T E X R A? not matching? 

But we have a word: ""METRO"" -> but does it have A? No? but we know A must be in the word? 

So we cannot use ""METRO"" because it doesn't have A? 

Similarly, we must include A? 

So the word must have A? 

Therefore, we need a word that has A, E, T, R and one more letter? and R at index3? 

Let me list possible words that fit the patterns and are common? 

Pattern 1: E A T R ? -> what words? 
   ""EAT R?"" -> ""EATRY"" not a word? 
   ""EATER"" has duplicate E? 
   ""EATRE"" not a word? 

Pattern 2: E T ? R A -> words: ""ETTRA""? not common? ""EXTRA"" is pattern3? 
   Pattern2 is E T X R A? 
   Example: ""extra"" -> but that is E X T R A? which is pattern3? 

Pattern3: E X T R A -> ""EXTRA"" is a word? 

Pattern4: T E X R A -> ""T E X R A"" -> ""TEXAS"" but that ends with S? not A? 
   ""TEXTA"" not a word? 
   ""TETRA"" -> T E T R A? duplicate T? 

Pattern5: X E T R A -> ""BETRA"" not a word? ""METRA"" is a word? but M E T R A? 

""METRA"" is a proper noun? 

Common words: 
   ""EXTRA"" is a common word? 

So ""EXTRA"" fits pattern3: E X T R A? 
   E at0, X at1, T at2, R at3, A at4? 

But we have constraints: 
   A at index4: is that allowed? 
      We know A cannot be at index0 or index2? index4 is new? so allowed? 
   E at index0: allowed? 
   T at index2: allowed? 
   R at index3: fixed? 
   X is the letter 'X'? 

But we also have the constraint for T: T is not at index4? which is satisfied? 
And E is not at index2 or index4? satisfied? 

But we must check if 'X' is allowed? 
   We know the word does not contain C, N, L? 
   X is not in that list? 

So ""EXTRA"" is a valid guess? 

But does ""EXTRA"" have duplicate letters? No? 

Therefore, we can guess ""EXTRA""? 

But let's see if it fits the feedback? 

We know the secret word has A, E, R, T? and one more letter? In ""EXTRA"", the fifth letter is X? 

But we don't know if the secret word has X? 

But we are guessing to get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a more common letter than X? 

But ""EXTRA"" is a common word? 

Another possibility: pattern5: X E T R A? 
   We can have ""METRA"" but not common? 
   Or ""PETRA"" -> proper noun? 

Or ""RETRA"" not a word? 

So ""EXTRA"" seems a good candidate? 

But let's consider: in the feedback for guess2, we had T(-) meaning T is present but not at index4? 
In ""EXTRA"", T is at index2? which is new? 

Also, we are testing E at index0? 

If we get feedback for ""EXTRA"": 
   If the secret word is ""EXTRA"", then we get all correct? 
   If not, we get feedback on the letters? 

But we have other patterns? 

For example, pattern1: E A T R X? 
   We need a word like ""EAT R?"" -> but what word? 
   ""EATRE"" not a word? 
   ""EATRY"" not a word? 
   ""EATER"" has duplicate? 

So pattern1 might not be possible? 

Pattern2: E T X R A? 
   Example: ""ETCRA"" not a word? 
   ""ETURA"" not a word? 

Pattern4: T E X R A? 
   ""TEXAS"" is a word but ends with S? 
   ""TEXTA"" not a word? 

Pattern5: X E T R A? 
   ""BETRA"" not a word? 
   ""METRA"" might be accepted? but not common? 
   ""SETRA"" not a word? 

So the only common word we have is ""EXTRA"" for pattern3? 

But there is another pattern: in case 1.2: 
   E T X R A -> which is pattern2? 
   But we don't have a common word? 

And case 1.2: E T X R A -> but we don't have a common word? 

Also, case 1.1: E A T R X -> no common word? 

Case 2: we have pattern4 and pattern5? 
   Pattern4: T E X R A -> no common word? 
   Pattern5: X E T R A -> no common word? 

Therefore, the only common word that fits one of the patterns is ""EXTRA"". 

So we guess ""EXTRA""? 

But wait, what if the secret word is not ""EXTRA""? 

We are using a guess to test? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have X? and tests the positions? 

For example, we can try a word that has E at index0? and A at index4? and T at index1? and then a common letter at index2? 

For example, ""ETA R?"" -> but we need R at index3? 

So ""E T ? R A"" 

What words? ""ETIRA""? not a word? 

""ETHRA""? not a word? 

""ETCRA""? not a word? 

So no? 

We can try a word that has E at index1? and A at index4? and T at index0? 

For example, ""T E ? R A"" 

""TEARA""? not a word? 
""TEBRA""? not a word? 
""TEDRA""? not a word? 
""TEFRA""? not a word? 
""TEGRA""? not a word? 
""TEIRA""? not a word? 

But ""TERRA"" has duplicate R? 

So no common words? 

Therefore, ""EXTRA"" is the best bet? 

But note: there is a word ""EXTRA"", and it is common? 

So we'll go with ""EXTRA"". 

But let's double-check the constraints for ""EXTRA"":

   E at index0: 
        We know E is in the word? and we haven't tested index0? 
        But we know E cannot be at index2 or index4? index0 is allowed? 
   X at index1: 
        We don't know about X? 
   T at index2: 
        We know T is in the word? and we haven't tested index2? 
        And T cannot be at index4? which is satisfied? 
   R at index3: 
        Correct? 
   A at index4: 
        We know A is in the word? and we haven't tested index4? 
        And A cannot be at index0 or index2? index4 is allowed? 

So it satisfies the constraints? 

Therefore, we guess ""EXTRA"". 

<guess>extra</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (present, wrong position), N (absent), E (present, wrong position).  
  - **Key insights**:  
    - R, A, E are in the word but not at positions 2, 3, or 5 (1-indexed).  
    - C and N are absent.  

- **Guess 2: ""alert""** → Feedback: A (present, wrong position), L (absent), E (present, wrong position), R (correct position), T (present, wrong position).  
  - **Key insights**:  
    - R is **confirmed at position 4** (index 3).  
    - A is present but not at positions 1 or 3 (index 0 or 2).  
    - E is present but not at positions 3 or 5 (index 2 or 4).  
    - T is present but not at position 5 (index 4).  
    - L is absent.  

### Deductions:
- **Secret word structure**: `_ _ _ R _` (R is fixed at position 4).  
- **Confirmed letters**: A, E, R, T must be in the word.  
- **Absent letters**: C, N, L.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - A cannot be at positions 1 or 3 → must be at **position 2 or 5**.  
  - E cannot be at positions 3 or 5 → must be at **position 1 or 2**.  
  - T cannot be at position 5 → must be at **position 1, 2, or 3**.  
- **Fifth letter**: An unknown letter (not A, E, R, T, C, N, L).  

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- The only common English word fitting all constraints (A, E, R, T present; R at position 4; no C/N/L) is **""EXTRA""**:  
  - E at position 1 (allowed, since E cannot be at 3/5).  
  - X (unknown) at position 2.  
  - T at position 3 (allowed, since T cannot be at 5).  
  - R at position 4 (confirmed).  
  - A at position 5 (allowed, since A cannot be at 1/3).  
- ""EXTRA"" tests:  
  - E at position 1 (new position).  
  - A at position 5 (new position).  
  - T at position 3 (new position).  
  - Introduces X (new letter).",Guess 3: extra -> FEEDBACK: E(-) X(x) T(-) R(✓) A(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
 This means:
   C is not in the word -> so we can avoid words with C.
   R is in the word but in the wrong position -> the word has R, but not in the second position.
   A is in the word but in the wrong position -> the word has A, but not in the third position.
   N is not in the word -> avoid N.
   E is in the word but in the wrong position -> the word has E, but not in the fifth position.

 Therefore, the secret word:
   Does not contain: C, N
   Contains: R, A, E (but not in the positions they were in ""crane"": R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5)

 Known positions:
   The word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ _

 We know R, A, E are present. Since E is not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions (index 1-4, 0-indexed).
 Similarly, A is not in the third position (index 2) and R is not in the second position (index 1).

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We want to use a word that includes R, A, E (to confirm their positions) and avoids C, N.

 Also, we want to try to place R, A, E in positions they might be.

 Since R is not in position 1 (because our guess had R at position 1 and it was wrong) OR wait: in ""crane"", R was at position 2 (if we count starting at 1, but in code index 1). Actually, in the feedback:

   Position 1: C (x) -> index 0
   Position 2: R (-) -> index 1
   Position 3: A (-) -> index 2
   Position 4: N (x) -> index 3
   Position 5: E (-) -> index 4

 So, R is in the word but not at index 1 (second letter). Similarly, A not at index 2 (third letter) and E not at index 4 (fifth letter).

 Since we don't know the positions of R, A, E, we should try a word that places them in new positions.

 Also, we know the first letter is not C (and not any letter that is now ruled out). Also, the fourth letter is not N.

 We can consider words that have R, A, E and use other letters that haven't been ruled out.

 We also want to maximize new information.

 Let's list the letters we know: R, A, E must appear. We don't know about the other two letters.

 Possible word choices:

 We might try a word that starts with a vowel or a consonant that is common and not excluded.

 Since A is one of the letters, we can try to put A in position 1? But wait, we don't know yet if A can be first.

 However, note that R cannot be in position 1? Actually, we don't know. The feedback only said that R is not in position 1 (index 1), but index 0 is still possible? 

 Actually, the feedback for C was at index 0: C(x) meaning C is not in the word at all. But we have no direct information about index 0 (first letter) other than it isn't C.

 Similarly, we haven't tested many consonants at the start.

 Let me clarify: The first letter of the secret word is not C (because C was at index0 and got marked x meaning absent). But it could be R? Note that R was at index1 and was marked absent in that position? But that doesn't preclude R from being at index0? Actually no: If R were at index0, then in the guess ""crane"", the R at index1 would still be in the word, but the feedback for that letter (R) would still be '-' (wrong position) even if R is also present elsewhere? 

 However, note: the feedback per letter does not account for duplicates unless the word has duplicates. Since the feedback showed R(-), it only means there's an R somewhere else. But if the secret word has two R's, we would see the R in the guess only get one mark? Actually, the feedback system: for each letter in the guess, you look at the secret word and mark a '- for each occurrence that is in the wrong position' or '✓ if in the correct position'. However, for duplicate letters, if the secret word has only one R, then only one R in the guess will get a '-' or '✓', and the duplicate will be marked as not present? 

 We must be cautious: the rules say ""each letter in your guess"" receives feedback. So if the secret word has one R and the guess has two R's, then one of them will be marked correctly (if in the right position) or incorrectly (if both in wrong positions) and the extra one will be marked 'x'. 

 However, in our case, ""crane"" has no duplicates. So we are safe.

 Therefore, we know:
   Secret word contains R, but not at position index1 (the second letter). It could be at index0, index2, index3, or index4? But note: we also have A and E to place.

 And E is not at index4, so E must be at one of positions 0,1,2,3? But position1: we had R there and it was not E? Wait, nothing prevents E from being at position1? Actually, the feedback for position1 was R(-), meaning the letter at that position in the guess was R and it was wrong. So the first letter of the secret can be anything except C, etc.

 Now, let's try to form a word that meets:
   Does not use C or N (since they are absent).
   Uses the letters A, E, and R (if they are the only ones we know? Not necessarily, there are two more letters we don't know).
   Also note: we don't have any constraints on the other letters except avoiding C and N.

 Possible guesses: We want to test as many new letters as possible and new positions.

 Some choices:

 Option 1: Start with R? But R could be at index0? Let me choose a word that has R at index0? Then we can see if R is at the start.

 Option 2: Place A in a new position, say index0? Then we can test if A is at the front.

 Let's try to think of words with common structures.

 Since R, A, E must be present and we know their forbidden positions, let me try:

   R cannot be at index1? So in the next guess, try R at index0? Then A and E in different positions.

 Example words: 
   We can try ""RAISE"" -> which has R at the start (index0), then A (index1), I (index2), S (index3), E (index4). 
   But note: A was not at index2? Actually, in ""crane"" we had A at index2 which was wrong, but in ""RAISE"", A is at index1? That's new? Also, E was forbidden at index4? So we cannot put E at index4? 

 In ""RAISE"": E is at index4? Which we cannot do because the feedback said E is not at index4? So we cannot put E at the end? Therefore, ""RAISE"" is invalid for guess because E goes to the end which we know is wrong.

 Then we try to put E not at the end? But in a 5-letter word, we have few options for E? 

 Alternatively, we can try ""AROSE"": 
   A at index0, R at index1, O, S, E at index4? 
   But E at index4 is forbidden? So same problem.

 How about ""EARLY"": 
   E at index0, A at index1, R at index2, L, Y? 
   But note: R cannot be at index2? No, we don't know? We only know from guess1 that R cannot be at index1? So index2 is allowed? 
   Also, E cannot be at index4? But placing E at index0 is fine? 
   Also, we know A cannot be at index2? But in EARLY, A is at index1? That wasn't forbidden? Only index2 was forbidden? 

 Let's check: 
   In ""crane"": 
        index0: C (x) -> so first letter is not C? 
        index1: R (-) -> so no R at index1? 
        index2: A (-) -> so no A at index2? 
        index3: N (x) -> so no N? 
        index4: E (-) -> so no E at index4?

   So for EARLY:
        E at index0 -> not forbidden? 
        A at index1 -> not forbidden? 
        R at index2 -> not forbidden? 
        L: we haven't tested? 
        Y: we haven't tested? 

   Also, we avoid C and N? Yes? 

   We also must have the letters A, E, R? Yes? 

   But note: does EARLY have duplicate letters? No? 

   However, we also need to confirm: in the secret word, A cannot be at index2? and E cannot be at index4? and R cannot be at index1? But EARLY has R at index2? and A at index1? which was the forbidden position for R? 

   Actually, the forbidden position for R is index1? So EARLY has R at index2? That is not forbidden? 

   But for A: we know from guess1 that A is not at index2? In EARLY, A is at index1? That was not forbidden? 

   Similarly, E was forbidden at index4? We are putting E at index0? That is allowed? 

   Therefore, EARLY seems okay? 

   However, note: we have E at index0? If the secret word has E at index0, we will get E(✓)? 

   Also, we have A at index1? But remember that position1 (index1) is forbidden for R? That doesn't say anything about A at index1? 

   So EARLY is a valid guess? 

   But let's consider: Is EARLY a common word? Yes? 

   But there's another problem: we know that R is in the word? But EARLY has R? Okay? 

   Therefore, I will guess ""EARLY"".

 Alternatively, we could try ""PATIO"" but then we don't have E? which we know is in the word? and we also want to include E? 

 Since we know A, R, E are in the word, we should include all three? Then EARLY does include A, R, E? 

 Another alternative: ""STARE"" but E is at the end? and N is absent? But E at the end is forbidden? 

 How about ""ALERT"": 
   A at index0, L at index1, E at index2, R at index3, T at index4? 
   This avoids E at the end? 
   But also, we have R at index3? and we have E at index2? 
   We know: E cannot be at index4? that doesn't prevent at index2? 
   And A at index0? 
   Also, R cannot be at index1? Our guess puts R at index3? 

   Also, we avoid C and N? 

   So ALERT includes A, R, ? ... A, L, E, R, T? It has A, E, R which we know? 

   But ALERT has R twice? Actually: ALERT has one R? Wait: A-L-E-R-T? So one R? 

   However, we haven't tested L and T? 

   Both EARLY and ALERT are valid? 

   Which one gives more information? 

   EARLY: tests letters E, A, R, L, Y? 
   ALERT: tests letters A, L, E, R, T? 

   We know we must include R, A, E? Both do? 

   Previously used letters: C, R, A, N, E? So EARLY introduces L and Y? ALERT introduces L and T? 

   Both L and T are common? 

   Another possibility: ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E? but E at index4 is forbidden? 

   ""ROATE"" -> but E again at the end? 

   How about ""RASPY"": R at index0, A at index1, S at index2, P at index3, Y at index4? 
      Then we haven't included E? which we know is in the word? 
   So we must include E? 

   So we have to choose a word with E? 

   Then EARLY or ALERT? 

   Let me check if ALERT has E? Yes? 

   We might also consider ""TAMER"": 
        T at0, A at1, M at2, E at3, R at4? 
        Avoids E at the end? (E at index3) 
        R at index4? 
        We know R cannot be at index1? But index4 is new? 
        And M? new? 
        Includes R, A, E? 

   But TAMER has no duplicate? 

   Another one? 

   However, note: the word should be valid and common? 

   Among EARLY, ALERT, TAMER? 

   Let me see which one covers more possibilities? 

   But since we have two spots that are not known? 

   I think ALERT is popular? 

   However, I recall: we know A cannot be at index2? In ALERT, A is at index0? In EARLY, A at index1? 

   Let me think: maybe A at index1? That wasn't forbidden? 

   We want to rule out possibilities? 

   Alternatively, consider ""PARSE"": 
        P at0, A at1, R at2, S at3, E at4? -> but E at4 is forbidden? 

   How about ""LATER"": 
        L at0, A at1, T at2, E at3, R at4? 
        E at index3? which is allowed? 
        Then R at index4? 
        So includes A,R,E? 
        Avoids C and N? 
        But note: in ""crane"", A was at index2? which was forbidden? Now we are putting A at index1? that was not forbidden? 
        Similarly, E at index3? 
        But the word ends with R? 

   And LATER is valid? 

   Now, we know R was forbidden only at index1? So index4 is fine?

   However, we don't know about the other constraints? 

   Actually, we are free to use A at index1? 

   So LATER is also a candidate? 

   Given the common words, let me pick ALERT? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ALERT to test:

        If we get:
          A at0: then we don't know if it exists? Actually, we'll get feedback per letter.

   But note: we want to maximize new letters? 

   Previously used letters: C, R, A, N, E -> we are bringing back R,A,E? That's okay? 

   We want to include the known letters to pin down their positions? 

   Since we know A, R, E are present, we can try to put them in positions that we haven't ruled out? 

   For ALERT:
      A at index0? -> test if A is at the start?
      L at index1? -> we haven't tested L? so we test a new letter?
      E at index2? -> test a position that wasn't ruled out for E? (only E not at index4? So position2 is possible? but also, in the previous guess, A was at index2? but that doesn't imply E cannot be there? 
      R at index3? -> position3? allowed? 
      T at index4? -> we haven't tested T? 

   For EARLY:
      E at index0? -> test if E is at the start?
      A at index1? -> test if A is at position1? which wasn't forbidden? 
      R at index2? -> test if R is at position2? 
      L at index3? 
      Y at index4? 

   We cannot have E at index4? But we are testing it at index0? 

   Both are valid? 

   I think EARLY might be better? because it puts A at position1? which we haven't tested? and we know position1 was the one that had R? but now we are testing A there? 

   Alternatively, we can try to avoid putting known letters in positions that we haven't tested? 

   Actually, we are forced to put known letters? 

   Now, let me choose EARLY? 

   But wait: the word must be in the dictionary? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""IRATE""? but I think E at the end? 

   I've got a word: ""REALM"": 
        R at index0 -> good? 
        E at index1? -> position1: but we know that R was not allowed at position1? but for E? 
        A at index2? -> but we know A was not allowed at index2? 
        L at index3? 
        M at index4? 

   No: if we put A at index2? that was forbidden? 

   So REALM is invalid? because the A is at index2? which we know is not allowed? 

   Therefore, we must avoid putting A at index2? Similarly, avoid E at index4? 

   Now, EARLY: 
        index0: E -> that's new? 
        index1: A -> not forbidden because we only know A not at index2? 
        index2: R -> not forbidden? 
        index3: L -> new? 
        index4: Y -> new? 

   So EARLY doesn't put any known letter at a forbidden position? 

   ALERT:
        index0: A -> new position? 
        index1: L -> new? 
        index2: E -> new? but note: we only know E not at index4? but we don't know if E can be at index2? 
        index3: R -> new? 
        index4: T -> new? 

   So both EARLY and ALERT are acceptable? 

   Decision: Let me pick ""ALERT"" because it covers positions that we haven't tested? And we are testing A at the start? 

   Actually, EARLY puts A at index1? and index1 was the position we had a bad R? Now we are putting A there? 

   If we get a '-' for A at index1? Then we know A is not at index1? 

   Similarly, if we get a '✓'? Then we know A is there? 

   But then we also test E and R? 

   Now, what about ALERT:

        A at index0: if we get ✓, then we know the first letter is A? 
        If we get '-', then A is in the word but not at start? 
        If get 'x'? then that would conflict? because we know A is in the word? 

   Similarly for the other letters? 

   But note: we know A is in the word? So we cannot get 'x' for A unless the word has duplicate? But ALERT has one A? 

   Actually, if the secret word has A but not at index0? then we would get '-'? 

   I think ALERT is a good choice? 

   But I just saw: ALERT puts A at index0? and E at index2? 

   How about EARLY: it puts E at index0? 

   There is no strong reason? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""TARES"": 
        T at0, A at1, R at2, E at3, S at4? 
        Then E is not at the end? (index3? not index4? okay? 
        But index4 is S? 
        So avoids E at the end? 
        And R is at index2? which is new? 
        But TARSE? Wait, TARES? 

   However, TARES (a valid word?) means? ... yes? 

   But in feedback: the word must be English word? 

   Actually, I think TARES is valid? 

   And it has A, R, E? 

   And we avoid the forbidden positions? 
        A at index1? -> not forbidden? 
        E at index3? -> not end? so allowed? 

   And R at index2? -> not forbidden? 

   Then that's good? 

   But TARES has E at index3? 

   We are testing T and S? 

   However, I'm leaning toward EARLY? 

   Given the choices, I will choose ""ALERT"" for the second guess? 

   Alternatively, note: we haven't tested many consonants? 

   Finally, I choose: 
        ""ALERT"" -> because it tests A at the start and E at the third? 

   But wait: what if A is at the start? Then we get a ✓? 

   What if not? then we get a '-'? 

   Similarly? 

   Let's go with ""ALERT"".

   However, to be safe, I'll look up common words? 

   Given the thought: ALERT is a common word? 

   Therefore, second guess: ""ALERT""

  But wait: previously, in the feedback, we got R(-) at index1? meaning R is in the word but not at index1? So if we put R at index3? that might be correct? 

  Also, we can see what happens? 

  So <guess>alert</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C and N are **not** in the secret word.  
- R, A, and E **are** in the word but were in incorrect positions. Specifically:  
  - R is not at position 2 (index 1).  
  - A is not at position 3 (index 2).  
  - E is not at position 5 (index 4).  

For the second guess, we need to use:  
- R, A, and E to verify their positions.  
- New letters to gather more information.  
- Avoid C, N, and placing R/A/E in forbidden positions.  

The word ""ALERT"" is a strong candidate because:  
- It includes known letters (A, E, R) in untested positions:  
  - A at index 0 (avoiding index 2).  
  - E at index 2 (avoiding index 4).  
  - R at index 3 (avoiding index 1).  
- It introduces new letters (L, T) for further testing.  
- It maximizes information by:  
  - Testing A at the start.  
  - Checking E and R in fresh positions.  
- It adheres to feedback constraints.

  E: present, but not in position 4 (index 4) -> so E is in the word, but not at the end (fifth letter)

Guess 2: ""alert"" -> A(-) L(x) E(-) R(✓) T(-)
Meaning:
  A: present, but not in position 0 (index 0) -> so A is in the word, but not the first letter
  L: absent (x) -> so L is not in the word
  E: present, but not in position 2 (index 2) -> so E is in the word, but not the third letter
  R: correct (✓) at position 3 (index 3) -> so R is the fourth letter (index 3) of the secret word
  T: present, but not in position 4 (index 4) -> so T is in the word, but not the last letter

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has the following letters for sure:
   - R (we have two confirmations: from guess1 and guess2, and in guess2 it is correctly placed at index3)
   - A (from guess1 and guess2, but not at index0, index2)
   - E (from guess1 and guess2, but not at index2, index4)
   - T (from guess2, but not at index4)

2. The secret word does not contain:
   - C, N, L (from the x's)

3. The position of R is fixed: it is at index3 (the fourth letter). So the word has the form: _ _ _ R _

4. Positions for A and E:
   - A cannot be at index0 (from guess2) and index2 (from guess1). So A must be at index1 or index4? But note: the word has 5 letters, indices 0,1,2,3,4.
   - However, we also have E that must be placed, and E cannot be at index2 or index4. So E must be at index0 or index1? But wait, index3 is taken by R? So E can be at index0, index1, or index2? But E cannot be at index2 (from guess2) and index4 (from guess1). So E must be at index0 or index1.

5. Also, T is present but not at index4. So T can be at index0,1,2? (since index3 is R).

6. The word has 5 letters. We know R is at index3. The other letters are A, E, T, and one more letter? Because we have 5 letters and we know 4: A, E, R, T? But wait, we don't know if there are duplicates? And we have two more positions? Actually, we have positions 0,1,2,4 to fill? and we have at least A, E, T and one more unknown letter? Because the word must have 5 distinct? Not necessarily? But we haven't encountered duplicates? 

But note: from the feedback, we have:
   In guess1: we had 5 distinct letters? 
   In guess2: we had 5 distinct letters? 
   And the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates? 

So we assume the secret word has distinct letters? 

But the rules don't require distinct? However, in Wordle, duplicates are possible? But in this case, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback? 

But to be safe, we should consider the possibility? However, the feedback for ""alert"" had A(-) and E(-) and R(✓) and T(-) and L(x). Since we got a ✓ for R and the others are marked as present (but wrong position) or absent, and no duplicate marks? So the secret word has one R? 

Similarly, for A: we got a '-' meaning there is an A but not at index0? and we know from guess1 that A is present? So if there were two A's, we might have seen two marks? But in ""alert"" we only have one A? 

So we assume the secret word has distinct letters? 

Therefore, the secret word has exactly the letters: A, E, R, T, and one more letter? 

We know the word does not contain: C, N, L? 

So we need to find a 5-letter word that:
   - Contains A, E, R, T and one more letter (not C, N, L)
   - R is at index3 (fourth letter)
   - A is not at index0 or index2 -> so A must be at index1 or index4? 
   - E is not at index2 or index4 -> so E must be at index0 or index1? 
   - T is not at index4 -> so T can be at index0,1,2? 

But note: if A is at index4, then E must be at index0 or index1? 
But if E is at index0, then A can be at index1 or index4? 

But we have to assign both A and E to positions? 

Also, T must be placed? 

And the fifth letter? 

Now, the positions:

   Let the word be: [p0], [p1], [p2], R, [p4]

Constraints:
   p0: can be E? or T? or the fifth letter? 
   p1: can be A? or E? or T? or the fifth letter? 
   p2: can be T? or the fifth letter? (but not A, not E? because A cannot be at p2 and E cannot be at p2? and R is at p3? so p2 must be T or the fifth letter? 
   p4: can be A? (if A is at p4) or the fifth letter? but note: E cannot be at p4? and T cannot be at p4? so p4 must be A or the fifth letter? 

But also, we have the fifth letter? which is one of the letters we haven't used? 

Now, let's list the possibilities for A and E:

Case 1: E at index0 -> then A can be at index1 or index4? 
Case 2: E at index1 -> then A can be at index4? (because index0 is taken by E? and index2 is forbidden for A? and index3 is R? so only index4? 

So:
   If E is at index0, then A can be at index1 or index4? 
   If E is at index1, then A must be at index4? 

Now, T must be placed? and T cannot be at index4? so T can be at index0,1,2? 
But if E is at index0, then T cannot be at index0? so T at index1 or index2? 
But if T is at index1, then if E is at index0, then index1 is T? so A must be at index4? 
Similarly, if E is at index0 and T at index2, then A can be at index1 or index4? 

But we also have the fifth letter? 

Let me denote the fifth letter as X? which is not A,E,R,T and not C,N,L? 

So the word: [p0], [p1], [p2], R, [p4]

Now, let's consider the cases:

Case 1: E at index0 -> word: E, [p1], [p2], R, [p4]
   Then A must be at index1 or index4? 
   T must be at index1 or index2? (since not at index4? and index0 is E? index3 is R? so index1 or index2? 
   Also, the fifth letter X must be in the remaining positions? 

   Subcase 1.1: A at index1 -> then word: E, A, [p2], R, [p4]
        Then T must be at index2? (because if T is at index1? but index1 is A? so T must be at index2? 
        Then the word: E, A, T, R, [p4]
        And p4 must be the fifth letter? 
        But note: T is at index2? which is allowed? 
        And p4: cannot be E (duplicate? but we assume distinct? so no) and not A? and not T? and not R? so it must be X? 
        Also, we know T is present? and we have T at index2? so that's okay? 
        But we also have the constraint that T is not at index4? which is satisfied? 
        So possible words: E A T R X, where X is a letter not in {A,E,R,T,C,N,L}? 

   Subcase 1.2: A at index4 -> then word: E, [p1], [p2], R, A
        Then T must be at index1 or index2? 
        If T at index1: word: E, T, [p2], R, A -> then p2 must be X? 
        If T at index2: word: E, [p1], T, R, A -> then p1 must be X? 

Case 2: E at index1 -> then word: [p0], E, [p2], R, [p4]
   Then A must be at index4? (because index0 is not allowed for A? and index2 is forbidden? and index3 is R? so only index4? 
   So word: [p0], E, [p2], R, A
   Then T must be at index0 or index2? (since not at index4? and index1 is E? index3 is R? index4 is A? so index0 or index2? 
   And the fifth letter X must be in the remaining position? 

   Subcase 2.1: T at index0: word: T, E, [p2], R, A -> then p2 must be X? 
   Subcase 2.2: T at index2: word: [p0], E, T, R, A -> then p0 must be X? 

So all possible patterns:

1. E A T R X  (with X at index4? and T at index2? and A at index1? and E at index0? and R at index3? -> pattern: E A T R X)
2. E T X R A   (with X at index2? and T at index1? and A at index4? and E at index0? -> pattern: E T X R A)
3. E X T R A   (with X at index1? and T at index2? and A at index4? and E at index0? -> pattern: E X T R A)
4. T E X R A   (with T at index0? and E at index1? and X at index2? and A at index4? -> pattern: T E X R A)
5. X E T R A   (with X at index0? and E at index1? and T at index2? and A at index4? -> pattern: X E T R A)

But note: in case 1, we have E A T R X? and X is at index4? 
In case 2: E T X R A? 
In case 3: E X T R A? 
In case 4: T E X R A? 
In case 5: X E T R A? 

We also have the constraint that the fifth letter X must be a letter not in {A,E,R,T,C,N,L}? 

Now, we need to find a word that matches one of these patterns? 

But we don't know X? 

We can make a guess that tests as many of these possibilities as possible? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position that we haven't tested? and also tests the positions for A and E? 

But note: we know R is fixed? 

We also know that A and E must be in the word? and T must be in the word? 

We have to guess the fifth letter? 

We can try to use a word that has the known letters (A, E, T, R) and one new letter? and that fits one of the patterns? 

But we have multiple patterns? 

We can also try to test the position of E? 

We know E must be at index0 or index1? 

If we can determine the position of E? then we can narrow down? 

Similarly, for A? 

But we have limited guesses? 

We have 6 tries? we have used 2? so 4 left? 

We can try a word that has E at index0? and see the feedback? 

But we have to include R at index3? 

So let me try to form a word that has E at index0? and R at index3? and then we can test? 

For example, from pattern 1: E A T R X? but we don't know X? 

We can choose a common word that fits one of the patterns? 

But we don't know X? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily have R at index3? because we already know R is at index3? so we can use that? 

But in the next guess, we must have R at index3? because it is fixed? 

So the next guess must have R at index3? 

So the word must be of the form: _ _ _ R _ 

And we know the letters must include A, E, T? and one more? 

We can try to use a word that has A and E in positions that we are unsure? 

For example, we can try to put E at index0? and A at index1? and then T at index2? and then we need a letter at index4? 

But we don't know the letter at index4? 

We can choose a common letter? 

For example, the word ""EATER""? 
   E at0, A at1, T at2, E at3? -> but duplicate E? and R at4? but we need R at index3? 

Not matching? 

The word ""EARTH"": 
   E at0, A at1, R at2? but we need R at index3? not at2? 

The word ""EXTRA"": 
   E at0, X at1, T at2, R at3, A at4 -> this matches pattern 3: E X T R A? 
   But we don't know if X is a valid letter? 

But ""EXTRA"" is a word? 

Similarly, ""EXERT"": 
   E at0, X at1, E at2? -> duplicate E? and E at index2 is forbidden? 

We cannot use? 

""ENTRY"": but E at0, N at1? but N is absent? 

""TEPID"": T at0, E at1, P at2, I at3? but we need R at index3? 

So we need R at index3? 

So the word must be: _ _ _ R _ 

And we want to test E at index0? 

So we can try: E _ _ R _ 

We can put A at index1? and T at index2? and then a letter at index4? 

But what letter? We can choose a common one? 

For example, ""EATER"": but E at0, A at1, T at2, E at3? -> duplicate E? and we need R at index3? but we have E at index3? 

Not possible? 

""EARTH"": E at0, A at1, R at2? -> but we need R at index3? 

How about ""EART H""? no, 5 letters? 

""EARTH"" has R at index2? 

We need R at index3? 

So we can try: E _ _ R ? 

We can do: E A T R ? -> but what word? 

""EATRY""? not a word? 

""EATER"" has duplicate E? 

""EAT R"" with R at the end? but we need R at index3? 

How about ""EAT AR""? no? 

Another idea: ""METRO"": M at0, E at1, T at2, R at3, O at4? 
   This has E at index1? and T at index2? and R at index3? 
   And O at index4? 
   And M at index0? 
   This matches pattern 4: M E T R O? but pattern4 is T E X R A? not matching? 

But we have a word: ""METRO"" -> but does it have A? No? but we know A must be in the word? 

So we cannot use ""METRO"" because it doesn't have A? 

Similarly, we must include A? 

So the word must have A? 

Therefore, we need a word that has A, E, T, R and one more letter? and R at index3? 

Let me list possible words that fit the patterns and are common? 

Pattern 1: E A T R ? -> what words? 
   ""EAT R?"" -> ""EATRY"" not a word? 
   ""EATER"" has duplicate E? 
   ""EATRE"" not a word? 

Pattern 2: E T ? R A -> words: ""ETTRA""? not common? ""EXTRA"" is pattern3? 
   Pattern2 is E T X R A? 
   Example: ""extra"" -> but that is E X T R A? which is pattern3? 

Pattern3: E X T R A -> ""EXTRA"" is a word? 

Pattern4: T E X R A -> ""T E X R A"" -> ""TEXAS"" but that ends with S? not A? 
   ""TEXTA"" not a word? 
   ""TETRA"" -> T E T R A? duplicate T? 

Pattern5: X E T R A -> ""BETRA"" not a word? ""METRA"" is a word? but M E T R A? 

""METRA"" is a proper noun? 

Common words: 
   ""EXTRA"" is a common word? 

So ""EXTRA"" fits pattern3: E X T R A? 
   E at0, X at1, T at2, R at3, A at4? 

But we have constraints: 
   A at index4: is that allowed? 
      We know A cannot be at index0 or index2? index4 is new? so allowed? 
   E at index0: allowed? 
   T at index2: allowed? 
   R at index3: fixed? 
   X is the letter 'X'? 

But we also have the constraint for T: T is not at index4? which is satisfied? 
And E is not at index2 or index4? satisfied? 

But we must check if 'X' is allowed? 
   We know the word does not contain C, N, L? 
   X is not in that list? 

So ""EXTRA"" is a valid guess? 

But does ""EXTRA"" have duplicate letters? No? 

Therefore, we can guess ""EXTRA""? 

But let's see if it fits the feedback? 

We know the secret word has A, E, R, T? and one more letter? In ""EXTRA"", the fifth letter is X? 

But we don't know if the secret word has X? 

But we are guessing to get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a more common letter than X? 

But ""EXTRA"" is a common word? 

Another possibility: pattern5: X E T R A? 
   We can have ""METRA"" but not common? 
   Or ""PETRA"" -> proper noun? 

Or ""RETRA"" not a word? 

So ""EXTRA"" seems a good candidate? 

But let's consider: in the feedback for guess2, we had T(-) meaning T is present but not at index4? 
In ""EXTRA"", T is at index2? which is new? 

Also, we are testing E at index0? 

If we get feedback for ""EXTRA"": 
   If the secret word is ""EXTRA"", then we get all correct? 
   If not, we get feedback on the letters? 

But we have other patterns? 

For example, pattern1: E A T R X? 
   We need a word like ""EAT R?"" -> but what word? 
   ""EATRE"" not a word? 
   ""EATRY"" not a word? 
   ""EATER"" has duplicate? 

So pattern1 might not be possible? 

Pattern2: E T X R A? 
   Example: ""ETCRA"" not a word? 
   ""ETURA"" not a word? 

Pattern4: T E X R A? 
   ""TEXAS"" is a word but ends with S? 
   ""TEXTA"" not a word? 

Pattern5: X E T R A? 
   ""BETRA"" not a word? 
   ""METRA"" might be accepted? but not common? 
   ""SETRA"" not a word? 

So the only common word we have is ""EXTRA"" for pattern3? 

But there is another pattern: in case 1.2: 
   E T X R A -> which is pattern2? 
   But we don't have a common word? 

And case 1.2: E T X R A -> but we don't have a common word? 

Also, case 1.1: E A T R X -> no common word? 

Case 2: we have pattern4 and pattern5? 
   Pattern4: T E X R A -> no common word? 
   Pattern5: X E T R A -> no common word? 

Therefore, the only common word that fits one of the patterns is ""EXTRA"". 

So we guess ""EXTRA""? 

But wait, what if the secret word is not ""EXTRA""? 

We are using a guess to test? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have X? and tests the positions? 

For example, we can try a word that has E at index0? and A at index4? and T at index1? and then a common letter at index2? 

For example, ""ETA R?"" -> but we need R at index3? 

So ""E T ? R A"" 

What words? ""ETIRA""? not a word? 

""ETHRA""? not a word? 

""ETCRA""? not a word? 

So no? 

We can try a word that has E at index1? and A at index4? and T at index0? 

For example, ""T E ? R A"" 

""TEARA""? not a word? 
""TEBRA""? not a word? 
""TEDRA""? not a word? 
""TEFRA""? not a word? 
""TEGRA""? not a word? 
""TEIRA""? not a word? 

But ""TERRA"" has duplicate R? 

So no common words? 

Therefore, ""EXTRA"" is the best bet? 

But note: there is a word ""EXTRA"", and it is common? 

So we'll go with ""EXTRA"". 

But let's double-check the constraints for ""EXTRA"":

   E at index0: 
        We know E is in the word? and we haven't tested index0? 
        But we know E cannot be at index2 or index4? index0 is allowed? 
   X at index1: 
        We don't know about X? 
   T at index2: 
        We know T is in the word? and we haven't tested index2? 
        And T cannot be at index4? which is satisfied? 
   R at index3: 
        Correct? 
   A at index4: 
        We know A is in the word? and we haven't tested index4? 
        And A cannot be at index0 or index2? index4 is allowed? 

So it satisfies the constraints? 

Therefore, we guess ""EXTRA"". 

<guess>extra</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (present, wrong position), N (absent), E (present, wrong position).  
  - **Key insights**:  
    - R, A, E are in the word but not at positions 2, 3, or 5 (1-indexed).  
    - C and N are absent.  

- **Guess 2: ""alert""** → Feedback: A (present, wrong position), L (absent), E (present, wrong position), R (correct position), T (present, wrong position).  
  - **Key insights**:  
    - R is **confirmed at position 4** (index 3).  
    - A is present but not at positions 1 or 3 (index 0 or 2).  
    - E is present but not at positions 3 or 5 (index 2 or 4).  
    - T is present but not at position 5 (index 4).  
    - L is absent.  

### Deductions:
- **Secret word structure**: `_ _ _ R _` (R is fixed at position 4).  
- **Confirmed letters**: A, E, R, T must be in the word.  
- **Absent letters**: C, N, L.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - A cannot be at positions 1 or 3 → must be at **position 2 or 5**.  
  - E cannot be at positions 3 or 5 → must be at **position 1 or 2**.  
  - T cannot be at position 5 → must be at **position 1, 2, or 3**.  
- **Fifth letter**: An unknown letter (not A, E, R, T, C, N, L).  

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- The only common English word fitting all constraints (A, E, R, T present; R at position 4; no C/N/L) is **""EXTRA""**:  
  - E at position 1 (allowed, since E cannot be at 3/5).  
  - X (unknown) at position 2.  
  - T at position 3 (allowed, since T cannot be at 5).  
  - R at position 4 (confirmed).  
  - A at position 5 (allowed, since A cannot be at 1/3).  
- ""EXTRA"" tests:  
  - E at position 1 (new position).  
  - A at position 5 (new position).  
  - T at position 3 (new position).  
  - Introduces X (new letter).

We don\'t know about the other two letters.\n\n Possible word choices:\n\n We might try a word that starts with a vowel or a consonant that is common and not excluded.\n\n Since A is one of the letters, we can try to put A in position 1? But wait, we don\'t know yet if A can be first.\n\n However, note that R cannot be in position 1? Actually, we don\'t know. The feedback only said that R is not in position 1 (index 1), but index 0 is still possible? \n\n Actually, the feedback for C was at index 0: C(x) meaning C is not in the word at all. But we have no direct information about index 0 (first letter) other than it isn\'t C.\n\n Similarly, we haven\'t tested many consonants at the start.\n\n Let me clarify: The first letter of the secret word is not C (because C was at index0 and got marked x meaning absent). But it could be R? Note that R was at index1 and was marked absent in that position? But that doesn\'t preclude R from being at index0? Actually no: If R were at index0, then in the guess ""crane"", the R at index1 would still be in the word, but the feedback for that letter (R) would still be \'-\' (wrong position) even if R is also present elsewhere? \n\n However, note: the feedback per letter does not account for duplicates unless the word has duplicates. Since the feedback showed R(-), it only means there\'s an R somewhere else. But if the secret word has two R\'s, we would see the R in the guess only get one mark? Actually, the feedback system: for each letter in the guess, you look at the secret word and mark a \'- for each occurrence that is in the wrong position\' or \'✓ if in the correct position\'. However, for duplicate letters, if the secret word has only one R, then only one R in the guess will get a \'-\' or \'✓\', and the duplicate will be marked as not present? \n\n We must be cautious: the rules say ""each letter in your guess"" receives feedback. So if the secret word has one R and the guess has two R\'s, then one of them will be marked correctly (if in the right position) or incorrectly (if both in wrong positions) and the extra one will be marked \'x\'. \n\n However, in our case, ""crane"" has no duplicates. So we are safe.\n\n Therefore, we know:\n   Secret word contains R, but not at position index1 (the second letter). It could be at index0, index2, index3, or index4? But note: we also have A and E to place.\n\n And E is not at index4, so E must be at one of positions 0,1,2,3? But position1: we had R there and it was not E? Wait, nothing prevents E from being at position1? Actually, the feedback for position1 was R(-), meaning the letter at that position in the guess was R and it was wrong. So the first letter of the secret can be anything except C, etc.\n\n Now, let\'s try to form a word that meets:\n   Does not use C or N (since they are absent).\n   Uses the letters A, E, and R (if they are the only ones we know? Not necessarily, there are two more letters we don\'t know).\n   Also note: we don\'t have any constraints on the other letters except avoiding C and N.\n\n Possible guesses: We want to test as many new letters as possible and new positions.\n\n Some choices:\n\n Option 1: Start with R? But R could be at index0? Let me choose a word that has R at index0? Then we can see if R is at the start.\n\n Option 2: Place A in a new position, say index0? Then we can test if A is at the front.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words with common structures.\n\n Since R, A, E must be present and we know their forbidden positions, let me try:\n\n   R cannot be at index1? So in the next guess, try R at index0? Then A and E in different positions.\n\n Example words: \n   We can try ""RAISE"" -> which has R at the start (index0), then A (index1), I (index2), S (index3), E (index4). \n   But note: A was not at index2? Actually, in ""crane"" we had A at index2 which was wrong, but in ""RAISE"", A is at index1? That\'s new? Also, E was forbidden at index4? So we cannot put E at index4? \n\n In ""RAISE"": E is at index4? Which we cannot do because the feedback said E is not at index4? So we cannot put E at the end? Therefore, ""RAISE"" is invalid for guess because E goes to the end which we know is wrong.\n\n Then we try to put E not at the end? But in a 5-letter word, we have few options for E? \n\n Alternatively, we can try ""AROSE"": \n   A at index0, R at index1, O, S, E at index4? \n   But E at index4 is forbidden? So same problem.\n\n How about ""EARLY"": \n   E at index0, A at index1, R at index2, L, Y? \n   But note: R cannot be at index2? No, we don\'t know? We only know from guess1 that R cannot be at index1? So index2 is allowed? \n   Also, E cannot be at index4? But placing E at index0 is fine? \n   Also, we know A cannot be at index2? But in EARLY, A is at index1? That wasn\'t forbidden? Only index2 was forbidden? \n\n Let\'s check: \n   In ""crane"": \n        index0: C (x) -> so first letter is not C? \n        index1: R (-) -> so no R at index1? \n        index2: A (-) -> so no A at index2? \n        index3: N (x) -> so no N? \n        index4: E (-) -> so no E at index4?\n\n   So for EARLY:\n        E at index0 -> not forbidden? \n        A at index1 -> not forbidden? \n        R at index2 -> not forbidden? \n        L: we haven\'t tested? \n        Y: we haven\'t tested? \n\n   Also, we avoid C and N? Yes? \n\n   We also must have the letters A, E, R? Yes? \n\n   But note: does EARLY have duplicate letters? No? \n\n   However, we also need to confirm: in the secret word, A cannot be at index2? and E cannot be at index4? and R cannot be at index1? But EARLY has R at index2? and A at index1? which was the forbidden position for R? \n\n   Actually, the forbidden position for R is index1? So EARLY has R at index2? That is not forbidden? \n\n   But for A: we know from guess1 that A is not at index2? In EARLY, A is at index1? That was not forbidden? \n\n   Similarly, E was forbidden at index4? We are putting E at index0? That is allowed? \n\n   Therefore, EARLY seems okay? \n\n   However, note: we have E at index0? If the secret word has E at index0, we will get E(✓)? \n\n   Also, we have A at index1? But remember that position1 (index1) is forbidden for R? That doesn\'t say anything about A at index1? \n\n   So EARLY is a valid guess? \n\n   But let\'s consider: Is EARLY a common word? Yes? \n\n   But there\'s another problem: we know that R is in the word? But EARLY has R? Okay? \n\n   Therefore, I will guess ""EARLY"".\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""PATIO"" but then we don\'t have E? which we know is in the word? and we also want to include E? \n\n Since we know A, R, E are in the word, we should include all three? Then EARLY does include A, R, E? \n\n Another alternative: ""STARE"" but E is at the end? and N is absent? But E at the end is forbidden? \n\n How about ""ALERT"": \n   A at index0, L at index1, E at index2, R at index3, T at index4? \n   This avoids E at the end? \n   But also, we have R at index3? and we have E at index2? \n   We know: E cannot be at index4? that doesn\'t prevent at index2? \n   And A at index0? \n   Also, R cannot be at index1? Our guess puts R at index3? \n\n   Also, we avoid C and N? \n\n   So ALERT includes A, R, ? ... A, L, E, R, T? It has A, E, R which we know? \n\n   But ALERT has R twice? Actually: ALERT has one R? Wait: A-L-E-R-T? So one R? \n\n   However, we haven\'t tested L and T? \n\n   Both EARLY and ALERT are valid? \n\n   Which one gives more information? \n\n   EARLY: tests letters E, A, R, L, Y? \n   ALERT: tests letters A, L, E, R, T? \n\n   We know we must include R, A, E? Both do? \n\n   Previously used letters: C, R, A, N, E? So EARLY introduces L and Y? ALERT introduces L and T? \n\n   Both L and T are common? \n\n   Another possibility: ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E? but E at index4 is forbidden? \n\n   ""ROATE"" -> but E again at the end? \n\n   How about ""RASPY"": R at index0, A at index1, S at index2, P at index3, Y at index4? \n      Then we haven\'t included E? which we know is in the word? \n   So we must include E? \n\n   So we have to choose a word with E? \n\n   Then EARLY or ALERT? \n\n   Let me check if ALERT has E? Yes? \n\n   We might also consider ""TAMER"": \n        T at0, A at1, M at2, E at3, R at4? \n        Avoids E at the end? (E at index3) \n        R at index4? \n        We know R cannot be at index1? But index4 is new? \n        And M? new? \n        Includes R, A, E? \n\n   But TAMER has no duplicate? \n\n   Another one? \n\n   However, note: the word should be valid and common? \n\n   Among EARLY, ALERT, TAMER? \n\n   Let me see which one covers more possibilities? \n\n   But since we have two spots that are not known? \n\n   I think ALERT is popular? \n\n   However, I recall: we know A cannot be at index2? In ALERT, A is at index0? In EARLY, A at index1? \n\n   Let me think: maybe A at index1? That wasn\'t forbidden? \n\n   We want to rule out possibilities? \n\n   Alternatively, consider ""PARSE"": \n        P at0, A at1, R at2, S at3, E at4? -> but E at4 is forbidden? \n\n   How about ""LATER"": \n        L at0, A at1, T at2, E at3, R at4? \n        E at index3? which is allowed? \n        Then R at index4? \n        So includes A,R,E? \n        Avoids C and N? \n        But note: in ""crane"", A was at index2? which was forbidden? Now we are putting A at index1? that was not forbidden? \n        Similarly, E at index3? \n        But the word ends with R? \n\n   And LATER is valid? \n\n   Now, we know R was forbidden only at index1? So index4 is fine?\n\n   However, we don\'t know about the other constraints? \n\n   Actually, we are free to use A at index1? \n\n   So LATER is also a candidate? \n\n   Given the common words, let me pick ALERT? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose ALERT to test:\n\n        If we get:\n          A at0: then we don\'t know if it exists? Actually, we\'ll get feedback per letter.\n\n   But note: we want to maximize new letters? \n\n   Previously used letters: C, R, A, N, E -> we are bringing back R,A,E? That\'s okay? \n\n   We want to include the known letters to pin down their positions? \n\n   Since we know A, R, E are present, we can try to put them in positions that we haven\'t ruled out? \n\n   For ALERT:\n      A at index0? -> test if A is at the start?\n      L at index1? -> we haven\'t tested L? so we test a new letter?\n      E at index2? -> test a position that wasn\'t ruled out for E? (only E not at index4? So position2 is possible? but also, in the previous guess, A was at index2? but that doesn\'t imply E cannot be there? \n      R at index3? -> position3? allowed? \n      T at index4? -> we haven\'t tested T? \n\n   For EARLY:\n      E at index0? -> test if E is at the start?\n      A at index1? -> test if A is at position1? which wasn\'t forbidden? \n      R at index2? -> test if R is at position2? \n      L at index3? \n      Y at index4? \n\n   We cannot have E at index4? But we are testing it at index0? \n\n   Both are valid? \n\n   I think EARLY might be better? because it puts A at position1? which we haven\'t tested? and we know position1 was the one that had R? but now we are testing A there? \n\n   Alternatively, we can try to avoid putting known letters in positions that we haven\'t tested? \n\n   Actually, we are forced to put known letters? \n\n   Now, let me choose EARLY? \n\n   But wait: the word must be in the dictionary? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose ""IRATE""? but I think E at the end? \n\n   I\'ve got a word: ""REALM"": \n        R at index0 -> good? \n        E at index1? -> position1: but we know that R was not allowed at position1? but for E? \n        A at index2? -> but we know A was not allowed at index2? \n        L at index3? \n        M at index4? \n\n   No: if we put A at index2? that was forbidden? \n\n   So REALM is invalid? because the A is at index2? which we know is not allowed? \n\n   Therefore, we must avoid putting A at index2? Similarly, avoid E at index4? \n\n   Now, EARLY: \n        index0: E -> that\'s new? \n        index1: A -> not forbidden because we only know A not at index2? \n        index2: R -> not forbidden? \n        index3: L -> new? \n        index4: Y -> new? \n\n   So EARLY doesn\'t put any known letter at a forbidden position? \n\n   ALERT:\n        index0: A -> new position? \n        index1: L -> new? \n        index2: E -> new? but note: we only know E not at index4? but we don\'t know if E can be at index2? \n        index3: R -> new? \n        index4: T -> new? \n\n   So both EARLY and ALERT are acceptable? \n\n   Decision: Let me pick ""ALERT"" because it covers positions that we haven\'t tested? And we are testing A at the start? \n\n   Actually, EARLY puts A at index1? and index1 was the position we had a bad R? Now we are putting A there? \n\n   If we get a \'-\' for A at index1? Then we know A is not at index1? \n\n   Similarly, if we get a \'✓\'? Then we know A is there? \n\n   But then we also test E and R? \n\n   Now, what about ALERT:\n\n        A at index0: if we get ✓, then we know the first letter is A? \n        If we get \'-\', then A is in the word but not at start? \n        If get \'x\'? then that would conflict? because we know A is in the word? \n\n   Similarly for the other letters? \n\n   But note: we know A is in the word? So we cannot get \'x\' for A unless the word has duplicate? But ALERT has one A? \n\n   Actually, if the secret word has A but not at index0? then we would get \'-\'? \n\n   I think ALERT is a good choice? \n\n   But I just saw: ALERT puts A at index0? and E at index2? \n\n   How about EARLY: it puts E at index0? \n\n   There is no strong reason? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose ""TARES"": \n        T at0, A at1, R at2, E at3, S at4? \n        Then E is not at the end? (index3? not index4? okay? \n        But index4 is S? \n        So avoids E at the end? \n        And R is at index2? which is new? \n        But TARSE? Wait, TARES? \n\n   However, TARES (a valid word?) means? ... yes? \n\n   But in feedback: the word must be English word? \n\n   Actually, I think TARES is valid? \n\n   And it has A, R, E? \n\n   And we avoid the forbidden positions? \n        A at index1? -> not forbidden? \n        E at index3? -> not end? so allowed? \n\n   And R at index2? -> not forbidden? \n\n   Then that\'s good? \n\n   But TARES has E at index3? \n\n   We are testing T and S? \n\n   However, I\'m leaning toward EARLY? \n\n   Given the choices, I will choose ""ALERT"" for the second guess? \n\n   Alternatively, note: we haven\'t tested many consonants? \n\n   Finally, I choose: \n        ""ALERT"" -> because it tests A at the start and E at the third? \n\n   But wait: what if A is at the start? Then we get a ✓? \n\n   What if not? then we get a \'-\'? \n\n   Similarly? \n\n   Let\'s go with ""ALERT"".\n\n   However, to be safe, I\'ll look up common words? \n\n   Given the thought: ALERT is a common word? \n\n   Therefore, second guess: ""ALERT""\n\n  But wait: previously, in the feedback, we got R(-) at index1? meaning R is in the word but not at index1? So if we put R at index3? that might be correct? \n\n  Also, we can see what happens? \n\n  So <guess>alert</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C and N are **not** in the secret word.  \n- R, A, and E **are** in the word but were in incorrect positions. Specifically:  \n  - R is not at position 2 (index 1).  \n  - A is not at position 3 (index 2).  \n  - E is not at position 5 (index 4).  \n\nFor the second guess, we need to use:  \n- R, A, and E to verify their positions.  \n- New letters to gather more information.  \n- Avoid C, N, and placing R/A/E in forbidden positions.  \n\nThe word ""ALERT"" is a strong candidate because:  \n- It includes known letters (A, E, R) in untested positions:  \n  - A at index 0 (avoiding index 2).  \n  - E at index 2 (avoiding index 4).  \n  - R at index 3 (avoiding index 1).  \n- It introduces new letters (L, T) for further testing.  \n- It maximizes information by:  \n  - Testing A at the start.  \n  - Checking E and R in fresh positions.  \n- It adheres to feedback constraints.\n\n<guess>alert</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: alert -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) E(-) R(✓) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n  C: absent (x)\n  R: present, but not in position 1 (index 1) -> so R is in the word, but not at index 1 (second letter)\n  A: present, but not in position 2 (index 2) -> so A is in the word, but not at index 2 (third letter)\n  N: absent (x)\n  E: present, but not in position 4 (index 4) -> so E is in the word, but not at the end (fifth letter)\n\nGuess 2: ""alert"" -> A(-) L(x) E(-) R(✓) T(-)\nMeaning:\n  A: present, but not in position 0 (index 0) -> so A is in the word, but not the first letter\n  L: absent (x) -> so L is not in the word\n  E: present, but not in position 2 (index 2) -> so E is in the word, but not the third letter\n  R: correct (✓) at position 3 (index 3) -> so R is the fourth letter (index 3) of the secret word\n  T: present, but not in position 4 (index 4) -> so T is in the word, but not the last letter\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the following letters for sure:\n   - R (we have two confirmations: from guess1 and guess2, and in guess2 it is correctly placed at index3)\n   - A (from guess1 and guess2, but not at index0, index2)\n   - E (from guess1 and guess2, but not at index2, index4)\n   - T (from guess2, but not at index4)\n\n2. The secret word does not contain:\n   - C, N, L (from the x\'s)\n\n3. The position of R is fixed: it is at index3 (the fourth letter). So the word has the form: _ _ _ R _\n\n4. Positions for A and E:\n   - A cannot be at index0 (from guess2) and index2 (from guess1). So A must be at index1 or index4? But note: the word has 5 letters, indices 0,1,2,3,4.\n   - However, we also have E that must be placed, and E cannot be at index2 or index4. So E must be at index0 or index1? But wait, index3 is taken by R? So E can be at index0, index1, or index2? But E cannot be at index2 (from guess2) and index4 (from guess1). So E must be at index0 or index1.\n\n5. Also, T is present but not at index4. So T can be at index0,1,2? (since index3 is R).\n\n6. The word has 5 letters. We know R is at index3. The other letters are A, E, T, and one more letter? Because we have 5 letters and we know 4: A, E, R, T? But wait, we don\'t know if there are duplicates? And we have two more positions? Actually, we have positions 0,1,2,4 to fill? and we have at least A, E, T and one more unknown letter? Because the word must have 5 distinct? Not necessarily? But we haven\'t encountered duplicates? \n\nBut note: from the feedback, we have:\n   In guess1: we had 5 distinct letters? \n   In guess2: we had 5 distinct letters? \n   And the feedback didn\'t indicate any duplicates? \n\nSo we assume the secret word has distinct letters? \n\nBut the rules don\'t require distinct? However, in Wordle, duplicates are possible? But in this case, we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback? \n\nBut to be safe, we should consider the possibility? However, the feedback for ""alert"" had A(-) and E(-) and R(✓) and T(-) and L(x). Since we got a ✓ for R and the others are marked as present (but wrong position) or absent, and no duplicate marks? So the secret word has one R? \n\nSimilarly, for A: we got a \'-\' meaning there is an A but not at index0? and we know from guess1 that A is present? So if there were two A\'s, we might have seen two marks? But in ""alert"" we only have one A? \n\nSo we assume the secret word has distinct letters? \n\nTherefore, the secret word has exactly the letters: A, E, R, T, and one more letter? \n\nWe know the word does not contain: C, N, L? \n\nSo we need to find a 5-letter word that:\n   - Contains A, E, R, T and one more letter (not C, N, L)\n   - R is at index3 (fourth letter)\n   - A is not at index0 or index2 -> so A must be at index1 or index4? \n   - E is not at index2 or index4 -> so E must be at index0 or index1? \n   - T is not at index4 -> so T can be at index0,1,2? \n\nBut note: if A is at index4, then E must be at index0 or index1? \nBut if E is at index0, then A can be at index1 or index4? \n\nBut we have to assign both A and E to positions? \n\nAlso, T must be placed? \n\nAnd the fifth letter? \n\nNow, the positions:\n\n   Let the word be: [p0], [p1], [p2], R, [p4]\n\nConstraints:\n   p0: can be E? or T? or the fifth letter? \n   p1: can be A? or E? or T? or the fifth letter? \n   p2: can be T? or the fifth letter? (but not A, not E? because A cannot be at p2 and E cannot be at p2? and R is at p3? so p2 must be T or the fifth letter? \n   p4: can be A? (if A is at p4) or the fifth letter? but note: E cannot be at p4? and T cannot be at p4? so p4 must be A or the fifth letter? \n\nBut also, we have the fifth letter? which is one of the letters we haven\'t used? \n\nNow, let\'s list the possibilities for A and E:\n\nCase 1: E at index0 -> then A can be at index1 or index4? \nCase 2: E at index1 -> then A can be at index4?

(because if T is at index1? but index1 is A? so T must be at index2? \n        Then the word: E, A, T, R, [p4]\n        And p4 must be the fifth letter? \n        But note: T is at index2? which is allowed? \n        And p4: cannot be E (duplicate? but we assume distinct? so no) and not A? and not T? and not R? so it must be X? \n        Also, we know T is present? and we have T at index2? so that\'s okay? \n        But we also have the constraint that T is not at index4? which is satisfied? \n        So possible words: E A T R X, where X is a letter not in {A,E,R,T,C,N,L}? \n\n   Subcase 1.2: A at index4 -> then word: E, [p1], [p2], R, A\n        Then T must be at index1 or index2? \n        If T at index1: word: E, T, [p2], R, A -> then p2 must be X? \n        If T at index2: word: E, [p1], T, R, A -> then p1 must be X? \n\nCase 2: E at index1 -> then word: [p0], E, [p2], R, [p4]\n   Then A must be at index4? (because index0 is not allowed for A? and index2 is forbidden? and index3 is R? so only index4? \n   So word: [p0], E, [p2], R, A\n   Then T must be at index0 or index2?

E A T R X  (with X at index4? and T at index2? and A at index1? and E at index0? and R at index3? -> pattern: E A T R X)\n2.

No? but we know A must be in the word? \n\nSo we cannot use ""METRO"" because it doesn\'t have A? \n\nSimilarly, we must include A? \n\nSo the word must have A? \n\nTherefore, we need a word that has A, E, T, R and one more letter? and R at index3? \n\nLet me list possible words that fit the patterns and are common? \n\nPattern 1: E A T R ? -> what words? \n   ""EAT R?"" -> ""EATRY"" not a word? \n   ""EATER"" has duplicate E? \n   ""EATRE"" not a word? \n\nPattern 2: E T ?

""EXTRA"" is pattern3? \n   Pattern2 is E T X R A? \n   Example: ""extra"" -> but that is E X T R A? which is pattern3? \n\nPattern3: E X T R A -> ""EXTRA"" is a word? \n\nPattern4: T E X R A -> ""T E X R A"" -> ""TEXAS"" but that ends with S? not A? \n   ""TEXTA"" not a word? \n   ""TETRA"" -> T E T R A? duplicate T? \n\nPattern5: X E T R A -> ""BETRA"" not a word? ""METRA"" is a word? but M E T R A? \n\n""METRA"" is a proper noun? \n\nCommon words: \n   ""EXTRA"" is a common word? \n\nSo ""EXTRA"" fits pattern3: E X T R A? \n   E at0, X at1, T at2, R at3, A at4? \n\nBut we have constraints: \n   A at index4: is that allowed? \n      We know A cannot be at index0 or index2? index4 is new? so allowed? \n   E at index0: allowed? \n   T at index2: allowed? \n   R at index3: fixed? \n   X is the letter \'X\'? \n\nBut we also have the constraint for T: T is not at index4? which is satisfied? \nAnd E is not at index2 or index4? satisfied? \n\nBut we must check if \'X\' is allowed? \n   We know the word does not contain C, N, L? \n   X is not in that list? \n\nSo ""EXTRA"" is a valid guess? \n\nBut does ""EXTRA"" have duplicate letters? No? \n\nTherefore, we can guess ""EXTRA""? \n\nBut let\'s see if it fits the feedback? \n\nWe know the secret word has A, E, R, T? and one more letter? In ""EXTRA"", the fifth letter is X? \n\nBut we don\'t know if the secret word has X? \n\nBut we are guessing to get feedback? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has a more common letter than X? \n\nBut ""EXTRA"" is a common word? \n\nAnother possibility: pattern5: X E T R A? \n   We can have ""METRA"" but not common? \n   Or ""PETRA"" -> proper noun? \n\nOr ""RETRA"" not a word? \n\nSo ""EXTRA"" seems a good candidate? \n\nBut let\'s consider: in the feedback for guess2, we had T(-) meaning T is present but not at index4? \nIn ""EXTRA"", T is at index2? which is new? \n\nAlso, we are testing E at index0? \n\nIf we get feedback for ""EXTRA"": \n   If the secret word is ""EXTRA"", then we get all correct? \n   If not, we get feedback on the letters? \n\nBut we have other patterns? \n\nFor example, pattern1: E A T R X? \n   We need a word like ""EAT R?"" -> but what word? \n   ""EATRE"" not a word? \n   ""EATRY"" not a word? \n   ""EATER"" has duplicate? \n\nSo pattern1 might not be possible? \n\nPattern2: E T X R A? \n   Example: ""ETCRA"" not a word? \n   ""ETURA"" not a word? \n\nPattern4: T E X R A? \n   ""TEXAS"" is a word but ends with S? \n   ""TEXTA"" not a word? \n\nPattern5: X E T R A? \n   ""BETRA"" not a word? \n   ""METRA"" might be accepted? but not common? \n   ""SETRA"" not a word? \n\nSo the only common word we have is ""EXTRA"" for pattern3? \n\nBut there is another pattern: in case 1.2: \n   E T X R A -> which is pattern2? \n   But we don\'t have a common word? \n\nAnd case 1.2: E T X R A -> but we don\'t have a common word? \n\nAlso, case 1.1: E A T R X -> no common word? \n\nCase 2: we have pattern4 and pattern5? \n   Pattern4: T E X R A -> no common word? \n   Pattern5: X E T R A -> no common word? \n\nTherefore, the only common word that fits one of the patterns is ""EXTRA"". \n\nSo we guess ""EXTRA""? \n\nBut wait, what if the secret word is not ""EXTRA""? \n\nWe are using a guess to test? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have X? and tests the positions? \n\nFor example, we can try a word that has E at index0? and A at index4? and T at index1? and then a common letter at index2? \n\nFor example, ""ETA R?"" -> but we need R at index3? \n\nSo ""E T ? R A"" \n\nWhat words? ""ETIRA""? not a word? \n\n""ETHRA""? not a word? \n\n""ETCRA""? not a word? \n\nSo no? \n\nWe can try a word that has E at index1? and A at index4? and T at index0? \n\nFor example, ""T E ?

We are given the feedback for the third guess ""extra"": E(-) X(x) T(-) R(✓) A(✓)

Interpretation:
- E is present but not in position 1 (index0). Since in ""extra"", E is at index0.
- X is absent (x) -> so the letter 'X' is not in the word.
- T is present but not in position 3 (index2). Because T was at index2 and got '-' meaning it's in the word but not there.
- R is correct at index3 (still ✓).
- A is correct at index4 (now we know A is at the end).

So from this feedback, we have:
- E: present, not at index0 (from this guess) and not at index2 (from guess2: E at index2 was wrong) and not at index4 (from guess1: E at index4 was wrong). But we just learned E is not at index0? But actually, we already knew E was not at index4 and in guess2 not at index2? Now we add not at index0? Therefore, the only position left for E is index1 (second letter). Because positions are 0,1,2,3,4? and index3 is R? So E must be at index1.

- A: we already knew A was not at index0 (from guess2) and not at index2 (from guess1). Now in this guess, A is at index4 and is ✓, so A is at index4.

- R: at index3, confirmed again.

- T: present but not at index2. From guess2, T was at index4 and got '-' meaning not at index4. So T cannot be at index2 (from this guess) or index4 (from guess2). And now we know the positions occupied: index0,1,2,3,4? Index3 and index4 are taken by R and A? So T must be at index0,1,2? But index1: we now know E must be there? Because we just deduced E must be at index1? So index1 is taken by E? Therefore, T must be at index0 or index2? But this feedback says T is not at index2? Therefore, T must be at index0.

- X: absent? so the secret word does not contain 'X'.

So now we have:
  Position 0: must be T? because E cannot be at0, and A is at4, R at3, and T cannot be at2 or4? and the only position left for T is index0? because index1 is taken by E? index2: T cannot be there? index3 and4 taken.

Therefore:
  index0: T
  index1: E
  index2: ??? (but T cannot be here? so we need a different letter? And note: T is already at index0? so we cannot duplicate? unless the word allows duplicates? But so far, no duplicates? but we must consider? however, the feedback hasn't indicated duplicates? So we assume distinct? Then index2 must be the fifth letter? Let Y be the fifth letter? at index2? And Y must be a letter not used? 
  index3: R
  index4: A

Therefore, the word is: T E ? R A

We know the fifth letter Y must be:
  - Not C, N, L, X (from previous absent letters: C, N, L from guess1 and guess2, and X from guess3)
  - And not T, E, R, A? because distinct? 
  - So a new letter? 

We have used: T, E, R, A? and the fifth letter? 

We also have constraints from previous feedback? 
  Guess1: R(-) -> so R was not at index1? and indeed, in our word, R is at index3? 
  Guess1: A(-) -> was not at index2? and indeed, A is at index4? 
  Guess1: E(-) -> was not at index4? and now E is at index1? 
  Guess2: A(-) -> was not at index0? and A is at index4? 
  Guess2: E(-) -> was not at index2? and indeed, E is at index1? 
  Guess2: T(-) -> was not at index4? and T is at index0? 
  Guess3: E(-) -> not at index0? and E is at index1? 
  Guess3: T(-) -> not at index2? and T is at index0? 

So consistency? 

So we need a 5-letter word: T E ? R A

The missing letter Y is at index2? 

We need to find Y such that ""T E Y R A"" is a word? 

Common words? 
  ""TERRA"" -> but that has duplicate R? 
  ""TETRA"" -> duplicate? 
  ""TESRA"" -> not a word? 
  ""TENRA"" -> doesn't look? 

But we can check: 
  ""terra"" -> T E R R A? duplicate R? 
  ""terra"" is a word? but it has two R's? 

But our feedback? 
  In guess2: we had R as ✓ at index3? but if the word has two R's? 
  But then in feedback: 
      For ""alert"": R was at index3 and correct? 
      And in ""extra"": R at index3 was correct? 
  But if the secret word has two R's? then in ""alert"" at index3: R is correct? 
  And in ""extra"": R at index3: correct? 
  However, in ""alert"" at index1: L was absent? 
  And in ""crane"": R was at index1? and got '-' meaning present but wrong position? but if there is only one R and it's at index3? then that is consistent? 
  But if there is another R? then in ""crane"", R at index1 would be correct? because there is an R at index1? 
  But in ""crane"", we had R at index1? and feedback was '-' (wrong position)? meaning that the R at index1 was not correct? so either the R at index1 was not present? or there was an R elsewhere? 
  So for a two-R word, the secret word must have R at index3? and then not at index1? so the second R can be elsewhere? 

But in our current reconstruction: T E Y R A? 
  If Y is R? then we have two R's? 
  Then the word: T E R R A? 
  That is ""TERRA""? 

But ""TERRA"" is a word? 

And the feedback? 
  For ""crane"": 
      C: absent? 
      R at index1: if the secret word is TERRA, it has an R at index1? index0 is T? index1 is E? index2 is R? index3 is R? index4 is A? 
      So R is at index2? So R is also at index1? That's not? 
      TERRA: indices: 
            index0: T
            index1: E
            index2: R
            index3: R
            index4: A
      So R at index1: but wait, there is no R at index1? There is E at index1? 
      Then R is at index2? which is not index1? and at index3? 
      Therefore, in guess1 ""crane"": 
          R was at index1? which is not in the secret word? Because the R's are at index2 and index3? 
          Therefore, it would get an 'x'? but we got a '-'? meaning the letter R is present? 
          Because the secret word has two R's? and one is at index2 and one at index3? 
          In the evaluation: for R in ""crane"" at index1: 
              It is not at index1? and since there is another R (the second R) that hasn't been accounted for? so it would be marked as present? '-' because it's in the word but not here? 
          Then it's consistent? 

  For guess2 ""alert"": 
        A at index0: absent? because in TERRA, A is at index4? so not at0? feedback was A(-) meaning present? so we have A at index4? 
            In TERRA, A is at index4? and index0? not A? so feedback should be A: present? 
            But TERRA has no A at index0? so '-' meaning present? but we also have one A at index4? 
        L at index1: absent? L is not in TERRA? so x? matches? 
        E at index2: if the secret word TERRA? E at index1? not at index2? so feedback: present? '-'? but we got E(-)? 
            Actually, TERRA: 
                indices: 
                    0: T
                    1: E
                    2: R
                    3: R
                    4: A
            So E is at index1? E at index2? In ""alert"", E was at index2? and the secret has E at index1? so not at index2? but E is present? so feedback '-' for E? matches? 
        R at index3: correct? because secret index3 is R? so ✓? matches? 
        T at index4: T is at index0? not at index4? but T is present? so '-'? matches? 

  For guess3 ""extra"": 
        E at index0: TERRA has E at index1? not index0? so present? '-'? matches? 
        X at index1: absent? TERRA has E? but not X? so x? matches? 
        T at index2: TERRA has R? not T? but T is present? at index0? so T at index2 is not correct? but present? '-'? matches? 
        R at index3: ✓ matches? 
        A at index4: ✓ matches? 

Therefore, TERRA matches all feedback? 

But TERRA has two R's? and in our initial analysis, we assumed distinct? but the feedback does not say distinct? 

So TERRA is a valid word? 

But we also need to check: is there any other possibility? 

We thought T must be at index0? and E at index1? 
But we have two R's? 
And we just found TERRA? 

But is there another word? 
If we allow duplicates? TERRA is a candidate? 

But note: in the fifth letter position, if it's R? then the word is TERRA? 

Are there other words? 
  For example, ""TEPRA""? but P has not been tested? 
  But TEPRA? 
      T E P R A? 
  Check feedback: 
      Guess3: T(-) meaning T is present? not at index2? 
          If TEPRA has T at index0? so T is present? 
          T at index2? we put T at index2? but we have P at index2? so T is at index0? 
      So consistent? 
  But in ""crane"": 
        R was at index1? and in TEPRA, R is at index3? and no R at index1? so R would be marked present '-'? 
  In ""alert"": 
        A: not at index0? marked '-' -> consistent? 
        L: absent? marked x -> consistent? 
        E: at index2? -> but TEPRA has E at index1? not at index2? but E is present? so '-' -> consistent? 
        R: ✓ -> consistent? 
        T: not at index4? marked '-' -> consistent? 
  So TEPRA is a possible word? 

But TEPRA? I don't think it's a common word? 

""TETRA"" has two T's? 

""TERRA"" is common? 

Another word: ""TERZA""? but not English? 

So the only common word seems to be ""TERRA"". 

But we have used 3 guesses? 

So we can guess TERRA? 

But note: TERRA has duplicate? so we must be cautious? 

We know the secret word? so we can guess TERRA? 

But let's think: are there any other possibilities? 
  We have discarded the distinct assumption? 
  And fixed:
      T at index0? 
      E at index1? 
      R at index3? 
      A at index4? 
      and the third letter must be something? 

But we can also consider: what if the secret word has a letter at index2 that is one of the known ones? like T? 
  But T at index2? this feedback says T(-) meaning not at index2? 
  So T cannot be at index2? 

Similarly, E cannot? A cannot? R? we have R at index3? but secret word index2? that would be another R? which is duplicate? 

And we got a '-' for R in ""crane"" at index1? so if there were an R at index2? it would be consistent? 

But T cannot be? so the only possibility is a new letter or R? 

But if we put a new letter? it must not be C, N, L, X? 

But then what common words exist? 

  T E ? R A

With ? being a letter not C,N,L,X and not T,E,R,A? 

But then what? 
  T E B R A? ""TEBRA"" not common? 
  T E D R A? ""TEDRA"" not common? 
  T E F R A? not known? 
  T E G R A? ""TEGRA"" is a proper noun? 
  T E H R A? -> ""THERA"" is a word? 
  T E I R A? 
  T E K R A? 
  T E M R A? 
  T E O R A? 
  T E P R A? 
  T E Q R A? 
  T E S R A? 
  T E U R A? 
  T E V R A? 
  T E W R A? 
  T E Y R A? 
  T E Z R A? 

But most of these are not common English words? 

Whereas ""TERRA"" is a word? 

Therefore, the best guess is ""TERRA"". 

We guess ""TERRA"". 

<guess>terra</guess></think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

### Feedback Summary:
1. **Guess 1 (""crane""):**  
   - C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (present, wrong position), N (absent), E (present, wrong position).  
2. **Guess 2 (""alert""):**  
   - A (present, wrong position), L (absent), E (present, wrong position), R (correct at position 4), T (present, wrong position).  
3. **Guess 3 (""extra""):**  
   - E (present, wrong position), X (absent), T (present, wrong position), R (correct at position 4), A (correct at position 5).  

### Deductions:
- **R is fixed at position 4** (index 3).  
- **A is fixed at position 5** (index 4).  
- **E** is present but cannot be at positions 1, 3, or 5 (indices 0, 2, 4) → must be at **position 2** (index 1).  
- **T** is present but cannot be at positions 3 or 5 (indices 2, 4) → must be at **position 1** (index 0).  
- The only position left is **position 3** (index 2), which must be filled by a letter that:  
  - Is **not C, N, L, X** (absent letters).  
  - Accounts for the feedback (e.g., ""crane"" showed R in the word but not at position 2).  
- The word must have **two R's** (to explain why R in ""crane"" was marked as present but wrong position).  
- The only word fitting all constraints is **""TERRA""** (T-E-R-R-A):  
  - T at position 1 (index 0).  
  - E at position 2 (index 1).  
  - R at position 3 (index 2) and position 4 (index 3).  
  - A at position 5 (index 4).  

<guess>terra</guess>",terra,"We are given the feedback for the third guess ""extra"": E(-) X(x) T(-) R(✓) A(✓)

Interpretation:
- E is present but not in position 1 (index0). Since in ""extra"", E is at index0.
- X is absent (x) -> so the letter 'X' is not in the word.
- T is present but not in position 3 (index2). Because T was at index2 and got '-' meaning it's in the word but not there.
- R is correct at index3 (still ✓).
- A is correct at index4 (now we know A is at the end).

So from this feedback, we have:
- E: present, not at index0 (from this guess) and not at index2 (from guess2: E at index2 was wrong) and not at index4 (from guess1: E at index4 was wrong). But we just learned E is not at index0? But actually, we already knew E was not at index4 and in guess2 not at index2? Now we add not at index0? Therefore, the only position left for E is index1 (second letter). Because positions are 0,1,2,3,4? and index3 is R? So E must be at index1.

- A: we already knew A was not at index0 (from guess2) and not at index2 (from guess1). Now in this guess, A is at index4 and is ✓, so A is at index4.

- R: at index3, confirmed again.

- T: present but not at index2. From guess2, T was at index4 and got '-' meaning not at index4. So T cannot be at index2 (from this guess) or index4 (from guess2). And now we know the positions occupied: index0,1,2,3,4? Index3 and index4 are taken by R and A? So T must be at index0,1,2? But index1: we now know E must be there? Because we just deduced E must be at index1? So index1 is taken by E? Therefore, T must be at index0 or index2? But this feedback says T is not at index2? Therefore, T must be at index0.

- X: absent? so the secret word does not contain 'X'.

So now we have:
  Position 0: must be T? because E cannot be at0, and A is at4, R at3, and T cannot be at2 or4? and the only position left for T is index0? because index1 is taken by E? index2: T cannot be there? index3 and4 taken.

Therefore:
  index0: T
  index1: E
  index2: ??? (but T cannot be here? so we need a different letter? And note: T is already at index0? so we cannot duplicate? unless the word allows duplicates? But so far, no duplicates? but we must consider? however, the feedback hasn't indicated duplicates? So we assume distinct? Then index2 must be the fifth letter? Let Y be the fifth letter? at index2? And Y must be a letter not used? 
  index3: R
  index4: A

Therefore, the word is: T E ? R A

We know the fifth letter Y must be:
  - Not C, N, L, X (from previous absent letters: C, N, L from guess1 and guess2, and X from guess3)
  - And not T, E, R, A? because distinct? 
  - So a new letter? 

We have used: T, E, R, A? and the fifth letter? 

We also have constraints from previous feedback? 
  Guess1: R(-) -> so R was not at index1? and indeed, in our word, R is at index3? 
  Guess1: A(-) -> was not at index2? and indeed, A is at index4? 
  Guess1: E(-) -> was not at index4? and now E is at index1? 
  Guess2: A(-) -> was not at index0? and A is at index4? 
  Guess2: E(-) -> was not at index2? and indeed, E is at index1? 
  Guess2: T(-) -> was not at index4? and T is at index0? 
  Guess3: E(-) -> not at index0? and E is at index1? 
  Guess3: T(-) -> not at index2? and T is at index0? 

So consistency? 

So we need a 5-letter word: T E ? R A

The missing letter Y is at index2? 

We need to find Y such that ""T E Y R A"" is a word? 

Common words? 
  ""TERRA"" -> but that has duplicate R? 
  ""TETRA"" -> duplicate? 
  ""TESRA"" -> not a word? 
  ""TENRA"" -> doesn't look? 

But we can check: 
  ""terra"" -> T E R R A? duplicate R? 
  ""terra"" is a word? but it has two R's? 

But our feedback? 
  In guess2: we had R as ✓ at index3? but if the word has two R's? 
  But then in feedback: 
      For ""alert"": R was at index3 and correct? 
      And in ""extra"": R at index3 was correct? 
  But if the secret word has two R's? then in ""alert"" at index3: R is correct? 
  And in ""extra"": R at index3: correct? 
  However, in ""alert"" at index1: L was absent? 
  And in ""crane"": R was at index1? and got '-' meaning present but wrong position? but if there is only one R and it's at index3? then that is consistent? 
  But if there is another R? then in ""crane"", R at index1 would be correct? because there is an R at index1? 
  But in ""crane"", we had R at index1? and feedback was '-' (wrong position)? meaning that the R at index1 was not correct? so either the R at index1 was not present? or there was an R elsewhere? 
  So for a two-R word, the secret word must have R at index3? and then not at index1? so the second R can be elsewhere? 

But in our current reconstruction: T E Y R A? 
  If Y is R? then we have two R's? 
  Then the word: T E R R A? 
  That is ""TERRA""? 

But ""TERRA"" is a word? 

And the feedback? 
  For ""crane"": 
      C: absent? 
      R at index1: if the secret word is TERRA, it has an R at index1? index0 is T? index1 is E? index2 is R? index3 is R? index4 is A? 
      So R is at index2? So R is also at index1? That's not? 
      TERRA: indices: 
            index0: T
            index1: E
            index2: R
            index3: R
            index4: A
      So R at index1: but wait, there is no R at index1? There is E at index1? 
      Then R is at index2? which is not index1? and at index3? 
      Therefore, in guess1 ""crane"": 
          R was at index1? which is not in the secret word? Because the R's are at index2 and index3? 
          Therefore, it would get an 'x'? but we got a '-'? meaning the letter R is present? 
          Because the secret word has two R's? and one is at index2 and one at index3? 
          In the evaluation: for R in ""crane"" at index1: 
              It is not at index1? and since there is another R (the second R) that hasn't been accounted for? so it would be marked as present? '-' because it's in the word but not here? 
          Then it's consistent? 

  For guess2 ""alert"": 
        A at index0: absent? because in TERRA, A is at index4? so not at0? feedback was A(-) meaning present? so we have A at index4? 
            In TERRA, A is at index4? and index0? not A? so feedback should be A: present? 
            But TERRA has no A at index0? so '-' meaning present? but we also have one A at index4? 
        L at index1: absent? L is not in TERRA? so x? matches? 
        E at index2: if the secret word TERRA? E at index1? not at index2? so feedback: present? '-'? but we got E(-)? 
            Actually, TERRA: 
                indices: 
                    0: T
                    1: E
                    2: R
                    3: R
                    4: A
            So E is at index1? E at index2? In ""alert"", E was at index2? and the secret has E at index1? so not at index2? but E is present? so feedback '-' for E? matches? 
        R at index3: correct? because secret index3 is R? so ✓? matches? 
        T at index4: T is at index0? not at index4? but T is present? so '-'? matches? 

  For guess3 ""extra"": 
        E at index0: TERRA has E at index1? not index0? so present? '-'? matches? 
        X at index1: absent? TERRA has E? but not X? so x? matches? 
        T at index2: TERRA has R? not T? but T is present? at index0? so T at index2 is not correct? but present? '-'? matches? 
        R at index3: ✓ matches? 
        A at index4: ✓ matches? 

Therefore, TERRA matches all feedback? 

But TERRA has two R's? and in our initial analysis, we assumed distinct? but the feedback does not say distinct? 

So TERRA is a valid word? 

But we also need to check: is there any other possibility? 

We thought T must be at index0? and E at index1? 
But we have two R's? 
And we just found TERRA? 

But is there another word? 
If we allow duplicates? TERRA is a candidate? 

But note: in the fifth letter position, if it's R? then the word is TERRA? 

Are there other words? 
  For example, ""TEPRA""? but P has not been tested? 
  But TEPRA? 
      T E P R A? 
  Check feedback: 
      Guess3: T(-) meaning T is present? not at index2? 
          If TEPRA has T at index0? so T is present? 
          T at index2? we put T at index2? but we have P at index2? so T is at index0? 
      So consistent? 
  But in ""crane"": 
        R was at index1? and in TEPRA, R is at index3? and no R at index1? so R would be marked present '-'? 
  In ""alert"": 
        A: not at index0? marked '-' -> consistent? 
        L: absent? marked x -> consistent? 
        E: at index2? -> but TEPRA has E at index1? not at index2? but E is present? so '-' -> consistent? 
        R: ✓ -> consistent? 
        T: not at index4? marked '-' -> consistent? 
  So TEPRA is a possible word? 

But TEPRA? I don't think it's a common word? 

""TETRA"" has two T's? 

""TERRA"" is common? 

Another word: ""TERZA""? but not English? 

So the only common word seems to be ""TERRA"". 

But we have used 3 guesses? 

So we can guess TERRA? 

But note: TERRA has duplicate? so we must be cautious? 

We know the secret word? so we can guess TERRA? 

But let's think: are there any other possibilities? 
  We have discarded the distinct assumption? 
  And fixed:
      T at index0? 
      E at index1? 
      R at index3? 
      A at index4? 
      and the third letter must be something? 

But we can also consider: what if the secret word has a letter at index2 that is one of the known ones? like T? 
  But T at index2? this feedback says T(-) meaning not at index2? 
  So T cannot be at index2? 

Similarly, E cannot? A cannot? R? we have R at index3? but secret word index2? that would be another R? which is duplicate? 

And we got a '-' for R in ""crane"" at index1? so if there were an R at index2? it would be consistent? 

But T cannot be? so the only possibility is a new letter or R? 

But if we put a new letter? it must not be C, N, L, X? 

But then what common words exist? 

  T E ? R A

With ? being a letter not C,N,L,X and not T,E,R,A? 

But then what? 
  T E B R A? ""TEBRA"" not common? 
  T E D R A? ""TEDRA"" not common? 
  T E F R A? not known? 
  T E G R A? ""TEGRA"" is a proper noun? 
  T E H R A? -> ""THERA"" is a word? 
  T E I R A? 
  T E K R A? 
  T E M R A? 
  T E O R A? 
  T E P R A? 
  T E Q R A? 
  T E S R A? 
  T E U R A? 
  T E V R A? 
  T E W R A? 
  T E Y R A? 
  T E Z R A? 

But most of these are not common English words? 

Whereas ""TERRA"" is a word? 

Therefore, the best guess is ""TERRA"". 

We guess ""TERRA"".
