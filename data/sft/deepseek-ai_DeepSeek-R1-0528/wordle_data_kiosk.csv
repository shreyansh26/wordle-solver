Alright, let's tackle this Wordle game. Starting fresh, I have to make my first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I need a solid starting word. I recall that effective starting words usually contain common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. 

Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. Consonants like S, T, R, N are also frequent. Words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" are often suggested. ""RAISE"" comes to mind—it has R, A, I, S, E. That covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). 

Using ""RAISE"" might reveal positions for these letters or confirm their presence. For example:
- If R is correct, it could narrow down the first letter.
- A and E are versatile, appearing in various positions.
- S often ends words but here it's in the fourth position.

If the secret word has any of these letters, the feedback will show ✓, -, or x. Even if none match directly, ruling out these letters helps refine future guesses. 

Considering alternatives: ""STARE"" shares similar traits. However, ""RAISE"" might be better as it starts with R instead of S—many words begin with S, testing R first provides a different angle. Another option is ""ROATE"", but it might be less common. 

I think ""RAISE"" is a strong opener—it's balanced and informative. Starting here will guide my next steps based on the feedback.

After considering common starting words for Wordle, I chose ""RAISE"" because it uses three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), maximizing the chances of matching letters in the secret word. It also tests multiple letter positions efficiently.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: ✓ (in the word and correct position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter S is in the word and it is in the 4th position (since in ""RAISE"", S is the 4th letter and it's correct).
2. The letter I is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (where we placed it). So I must be in one of the other positions: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th? But note: the word has 5 positions. However, we know S is in the 4th, so I cannot be in the 4th. Therefore, I must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.
3. The letters R, A, and E are not in the word at all.

We also know that the word contains at least the letters I and S.

Now, we must make a second guess. We want to use a word that:
- Includes the letter I (since we know it's in the word, but we don't know where) and the letter S (which we know is in the 4th position, so we can keep it there to confirm or to get more information about other letters? Actually, we can try to put S in the 4th position again to see if it remains correct, but that might not be necessary because we already know it's correct. However, we can use S in the 4th again to test other letters.

But note: the feedback for S was ✓, meaning it is in the correct position. So in the next guess, we can keep S in the 4th position to free up other positions to test for I and other new letters.

Also, we must avoid using R, A, and E.

So, for the second guess, we should:
- Place S in the 4th position.
- Include the letter I, but not in the 3rd position (since we know it's not there). We can try I in a different position (like 1st, 2nd, or 5th) to see if we can locate its correct position.
- Use other letters that we haven't tried yet (so avoid R, A, E, and also we know S and I are in, but we need to test more letters).

We also want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.

Let me think of words that have:
- S in the 4th position.
- I in either 1st, 2nd, or 5th position (but not 3rd).
- And avoid R, A, E.

Possible words:

Option 1: Put I in the 1st position: e.g., words like ""I__S_"". But we need to fill the blanks with new letters.

Examples: 
- ""INKS"" -> but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters: so ""INKSY""? Not a word. 
- ""ICKS"" -> not 5 letters. 
- ""IMPSY""? Not a word.

Better: 
- ""PICKS"" -> P I C K S. But then S is the 5th letter, not 4th. We need S in the 4th.

So, the structure: _ _ _ S _

We want to put I in the first, second, or fifth.

Try I in the first: I _ _ S _
Words: 
- ""INKSY"" -> not a word.
- ""IGLUS"" -> not common, but valid? Actually, ""IGLUS"" is the plural of iglu, but let's stick to common words.
- ""ITCHS"" -> not a word, and also we need 5 letters: ""ITCHY"" has Y at the end, but then S is not in the 4th? ""ITCHY"" is I T C H Y -> no S.

Try I in the second: _ I _ S _
Words:
- ""PILOT"" -> but then S is not in the 4th? We need the 4th to be S. So the word must have the 4th letter as S. So the pattern is: first letter, then I, then third letter, then S, then fifth letter.

Examples:
- ""MILKS"" -> M I L K S -> but S is the 5th, not 4th. We need the 4th to be S, so the word must be: [letter1][letter2][letter3]S[letter5]. And we want to put I in the second position: so [letter1] I [letter3] S [letter5].

What words fit that? 
- ""TIPSY"" -> T I P S Y -> that works: T (1st), I (2nd), P (3rd), S (4th), Y (5th). And it avoids R, A, E.

Another: ""DITSY"" -> D I T S Y -> also works.

But we also know that I is in the word but not in the 3rd position, so putting I in the 2nd is a new position.

We could also try I in the 5th: _ _ _ S I
Words: 
- ""MUSIC"" -> M U S I C -> but then S is in the 3rd, not 4th. We need the 4th to be S. So the pattern: [1][2][3]S[5] and we want I at the 5th: [1][2][3]S I.

Examples: 
- ""OPSIS"" -> not common? 
- ""BASSI"" -> not common? 
- ""FUSSI"" -> not a word.

More common: ""MESSI"" -> not a word? Actually, we need valid English words.

Another: ""PASSI"" -> not a word.

It's harder to find words with I at the end and S at the 4th. So maybe the second position is better.

We could also try I in the first: I _ _ S _
But then we need a word: I [letter2] [letter3] S [letter5]. 
Examples: 
- ""ITEMS"" -> I T E M S -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). 
- ""IDOLS"" -> I D O L S -> but S is the 5th, not 4th. 
- ""ICONS"" -> I C O N S -> again, S is the 5th.

We need the 4th to be S, so the word must be I [letter2] [letter3] S [letter5]. 
- ""INFOS"" -> not a common word? 
- ""INNIS"" -> not a word.

Alternatively, we can try without fixing S? But we know S is in the 4th, so we can keep it there to avoid wasting a position. However, the rules don't require that we keep known letters in the same position, but it's a good strategy to confirm or to get more information.

But note: we are sure S is in the 4th, so we can keep it. That way, we can use the other positions to test new letters and the letter I in a new position.

So, let's go with the pattern: _ I _ S _ -> that is, second letter I and fourth letter S.

We have: [1] I [3] S [5]

We need to choose letters for positions 1, 3, and 5 that are not R, A, E, and are new.

We also want to test common letters to get more information.

Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let me try to form words:
- ""TIPSY"": T I P S Y -> T, P, Y are new. This is a valid word.
- ""DITSY"": D I T S Y -> D, T, Y are new. Also valid.
- ""MISOS"": M I S O S -> but then the 3rd is S? No: M I S O S -> that would be: 1:M, 2:I, 3:S, 4:O, 5:S -> but we need the 4th to be S, so that doesn't fit.

Another: ""LISPS"": L I S P S -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:S, 4:P, 5:S -> but then the 4th is P, not S. So no.

So, ""TIPSY"" and ""DITSY"" are good candidates.

We could also try ""WISPY"": W I S P Y -> again, 3rd is S, not 4th.

So, the pattern [1] I [3] S [5] must have the 3rd position as a letter that is not S (because S is at 4th). So the word must have distinct positions.

In ""TIPSY"": 
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

This is good.

Similarly, ""DITSY"": D I T S Y.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

In ""TIPSY"", we test T, P, Y.
In ""DITSY"", we test D, T, Y.

Both test T and Y. The difference is P vs D.

P is more common than D? Actually, in English, both are common. But we can choose either.

Alternatively, we can try to include more vowels? But we know the word has I, and we don't know about other vowels. But we have eliminated A and E, so the remaining vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y (which is in both words).

We might also consider ""GIPSY"" (variant of gypsy) -> G I P S Y.

But let's stick to common words.

Another option: ""BISKS"" -> not common? ""BISK"" is not typically 5 letters.

I think ""TIPSY"" is a good choice.

But note: we know I is in the word, but we don't know where. By putting I in the second position, we are testing if it is in the second position. If we get a ✓ for I, then we know it's in the second. If we get a -, then it's in the word but not in the second (and not in the third, so it must be in the first or fifth). If we get an x, that would be impossible because we know I is in the word. But the feedback for I in the first guess was '-' meaning it is in the word, so it must be in the word. Therefore, in the second guess, if we put I in the second position, we can get either ✓ or - (but not x).

So, ""TIPSY"" seems a good guess.

We can also consider ""PIOUS"" -> P I O U S -> but then S is the 5th, not 4th. So no.

Another word: ""BIOS"" is 4 letters.

So, I think ""TIPSY"" is a solid choice.

Let me check if there are other words that use more common letters? For example, ""LISPS"" doesn't fit the pattern. ""MINIS"" -> M I N I S -> but then the 4th is I, not S. So no.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TIPSY"".

So the second guess is ""TIPSY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, and E are not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).
- S is in the word and correctly placed in the 4th position (✓).

Key insights:
- The secret word contains I and S, with S fixed in the 4th position.
- I must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is invalid and position 4 is occupied by S).
- Avoid using R, A, or E in the next guess.

For the second guess:
- Keep S in the 4th position to maintain the known correct placement.
- Test I in a new position (e.g., 2nd position) to gather more information about its location.
- Introduce new, common consonants (like T, P, Y) to maximize feedback on untested letters.
- ""TIPSY"" fits these criteria: 
  - Places I in the 2nd position (testing a new spot).
  - Keeps S in the 4th position.
  - Uses new letters (T, P, Y) and avoids R, A, E.
  - It's a valid English word.

This guess will help narrow down the position of I and reveal if T, P, or Y are in the word.

<guess>TIPSY</guess>",TIPSY,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: ✓ (in the word and correct position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter S is in the word and it is in the 4th position (since in ""RAISE"", S is the 4th letter and it's correct).
2. The letter I is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (where we placed it). So I must be in one of the other positions: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th? But note: the word has 5 positions. However, we know S is in the 4th, so I cannot be in the 4th. Therefore, I must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

- ""TIPSY"": T I P S Y -> T, P, Y are new. This is a valid word.
- ""DITSY"": D I T S Y -> D, T, Y are new. Also valid.
- ""MISOS"": M I S O S -> but then the 3rd is S? No: M I S O S -> that would be: 1:M, 2:I, 3:S, 4:O, 5:S -> but we need the 4th to be S, so that doesn't fit.

Another: ""LISPS"": L I S P S -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:S, 4:P, 5:S -> but then the 4th is P, not S. So no.

So, ""TIPSY"" and ""DITSY"" are good candidates.

We could also try ""WISPY"": W I S P Y -> again, 3rd is S, not 4th.

So, the pattern [1] I [3] S [5] must have the 3rd position as a letter that is not S (because S is at 4th). So the word must have distinct positions.

In ""TIPSY"": 
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

This is good.

Similarly, ""DITSY"": D I T S Y.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

In ""TIPSY"", we test T, P, Y.
In ""DITSY"", we test D, T, Y.

Both test T and Y. The difference is P vs D.

P is more common than D? Actually, in English, both are common. But we can choose either.

Alternatively, we can try to include more vowels? But we know the word has I, and we don't know about other vowels. But we have eliminated A and E, so the remaining vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y (which is in both words).

We might also consider ""GIPSY"" (variant of gypsy) -> G I P S Y.

But let's stick to common words.

Another option: ""BISKS"" -> not common? ""BISK"" is not typically 5 letters.

I think ""TIPSY"" is a good choice.

But note: we know I is in the word, but we don't know where. By putting I in the second position, we are testing if it is in the second position. If we get a ✓ for I, then we know it's in the second. If we get a -, then it's in the word but not in the second (and not in the third, so it must be in the first or fifth). If we get an x, that would be impossible because we know I is in the word. But the feedback for I in the first guess was '-' meaning it is in the word, so it must be in the word. Therefore, in the second guess, if we put I in the second position, we can get either ✓ or - (but not x).

So, ""TIPSY"" seems a good guess.

We can also consider ""PIOUS"" -> P I O U S -> but then S is the 5th, not 4th. So no.

Another word: ""BIOS"" is 4 letters.

So, I think ""TIPSY"" is a solid choice.

Let me check if there are other words that use more common letters? For example, ""LISPS"" doesn't fit the pattern. ""MINIS"" -> M I N I S -> but then the 4th is I, not S. So no.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TIPSY"".

So the second guess is ""TIPSY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, and E are not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).
- S is in the word and correctly placed in the 4th position (✓).

Key insights:
- The secret word contains I and S, with S fixed in the 4th position.
- I must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is invalid and position 4 is occupied by S).
- Avoid using R, A, or E in the next guess.

For the second guess:
- Keep S in the 4th position to maintain the known correct placement.
- Test I in a new position (e.g., 2nd position) to gather more information about its location.
- Introduce new, common consonants (like T, P, Y) to maximize feedback on untested letters.
- ""TIPSY"" fits these criteria: 
  - Places I in the 2nd position (testing a new spot).
  - Keeps S in the 4th position.
  - Uses new letters (T, P, Y) and avoids R, A, E.
  - It's a valid English word.

This guess will help narrow down the position of I and reveal if T, P, or Y are in the word.",Guess 2: TIPSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(✓) P(x) S(✓) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,kiosk,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's tackle this Wordle game. Starting fresh, I have to make my first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I need a solid starting word. I recall that effective starting words usually contain common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. 

Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. Consonants like S, T, R, N are also frequent. Words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" are often suggested. ""RAISE"" comes to mind—it has R, A, I, S, E. That covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). 

Using ""RAISE"" might reveal positions for these letters or confirm their presence. For example:
- If R is correct, it could narrow down the first letter.
- A and E are versatile, appearing in various positions.
- S often ends words but here it's in the fourth position.

If the secret word has any of these letters, the feedback will show ✓, -, or x. Even if none match directly, ruling out these letters helps refine future guesses. 

Considering alternatives: ""STARE"" shares similar traits. However, ""RAISE"" might be better as it starts with R instead of S—many words begin with S, testing R first provides a different angle. Another option is ""ROATE"", but it might be less common. 

I think ""RAISE"" is a strong opener—it's balanced and informative. Starting here will guide my next steps based on the feedback.After considering common starting words for Wordle, I chose ""RAISE"" because it uses three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), maximizing the chances of matching letters in the secret word. It also tests multiple letter positions efficiently.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: ✓ (in the word and correct position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter S is in the word and it is in the 4th position (since in ""RAISE"", S is the 4th letter and it's correct).
2. The letter I is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (where we placed it). So I must be in one of the other positions: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th? But note: the word has 5 positions. However, we know S is in the 4th, so I cannot be in the 4th. Therefore, I must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.
3. The letters R, A, and E are not in the word at all.

We also know that the word contains at least the letters I and S.

Now, we must make a second guess. We want to use a word that:
- Includes the letter I (since we know it's in the word, but we don't know where) and the letter S (which we know is in the 4th position, so we can keep it there to confirm or to get more information about other letters? Actually, we can try to put S in the 4th position again to see if it remains correct, but that might not be necessary because we already know it's correct. However, we can use S in the 4th again to test other letters.

But note: the feedback for S was ✓, meaning it is in the correct position. So in the next guess, we can keep S in the 4th position to free up other positions to test for I and other new letters.

Also, we must avoid using R, A, and E.

So, for the second guess, we should:
- Place S in the 4th position.
- Include the letter I, but not in the 3rd position (since we know it's not there). We can try I in a different position (like 1st, 2nd, or 5th) to see if we can locate its correct position.
- Use other letters that we haven't tried yet (so avoid R, A, E, and also we know S and I are in, but we need to test more letters).

We also want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.

Let me think of words that have:
- S in the 4th position.
- I in either 1st, 2nd, or 5th position (but not 3rd).
- And avoid R, A, E.

Possible words:

Option 1: Put I in the 1st position: e.g., words like ""I__S_"". But we need to fill the blanks with new letters.

Examples: 
- ""INKS"" -> but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters: so ""INKSY""? Not a word. 
- ""ICKS"" -> not 5 letters. 
- ""IMPSY""? Not a word.

Better: 
- ""PICKS"" -> P I C K S. But then S is the 5th letter, not 4th. We need S in the 4th.

So, the structure: _ _ _ S _

We want to put I in the first, second, or fifth.

Try I in the first: I _ _ S _
Words: 
- ""INKSY"" -> not a word.
- ""IGLUS"" -> not common, but valid? Actually, ""IGLUS"" is the plural of iglu, but let's stick to common words.
- ""ITCHS"" -> not a word, and also we need 5 letters: ""ITCHY"" has Y at the end, but then S is not in the 4th? ""ITCHY"" is I T C H Y -> no S.

Try I in the second: _ I _ S _
Words:
- ""PILOT"" -> but then S is not in the 4th? We need the 4th to be S. So the word must have the 4th letter as S. So the pattern is: first letter, then I, then third letter, then S, then fifth letter.

Examples:
- ""MILKS"" -> M I L K S -> but S is the 5th, not 4th. We need the 4th to be S, so the word must be: [letter1][letter2][letter3]S[letter5]. And we want to put I in the second position: so [letter1] I [letter3] S [letter5].

What words fit that? 
- ""TIPSY"" -> T I P S Y -> that works: T (1st), I (2nd), P (3rd), S (4th), Y (5th). And it avoids R, A, E.

Another: ""DITSY"" -> D I T S Y -> also works.

But we also know that I is in the word but not in the 3rd position, so putting I in the 2nd is a new position.

We could also try I in the 5th: _ _ _ S I
Words: 
- ""MUSIC"" -> M U S I C -> but then S is in the 3rd, not 4th. We need the 4th to be S. So the pattern: [1][2][3]S[5] and we want I at the 5th: [1][2][3]S I.

Examples: 
- ""OPSIS"" -> not common? 
- ""BASSI"" -> not common? 
- ""FUSSI"" -> not a word.

More common: ""MESSI"" -> not a word? Actually, we need valid English words.

Another: ""PASSI"" -> not a word.

It's harder to find words with I at the end and S at the 4th. So maybe the second position is better.

We could also try I in the first: I _ _ S _
But then we need a word: I [letter2] [letter3] S [letter5]. 
Examples: 
- ""ITEMS"" -> I T E M S -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). 
- ""IDOLS"" -> I D O L S -> but S is the 5th, not 4th. 
- ""ICONS"" -> I C O N S -> again, S is the 5th.

We need the 4th to be S, so the word must be I [letter2] [letter3] S [letter5]. 
- ""INFOS"" -> not a common word? 
- ""INNIS"" -> not a word.

Alternatively, we can try without fixing S? But we know S is in the 4th, so we can keep it there to avoid wasting a position. However, the rules don't require that we keep known letters in the same position, but it's a good strategy to confirm or to get more information.

But note: we are sure S is in the 4th, so we can keep it. That way, we can use the other positions to test new letters and the letter I in a new position.

So, let's go with the pattern: _ I _ S _ -> that is, second letter I and fourth letter S.

We have: [1] I [3] S [5]

We need to choose letters for positions 1, 3, and 5 that are not R, A, E, and are new.

We also want to test common letters to get more information.

Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let me try to form words:
- ""TIPSY"": T I P S Y -> T, P, Y are new. This is a valid word.
- ""DITSY"": D I T S Y -> D, T, Y are new. Also valid.
- ""MISOS"": M I S O S -> but then the 3rd is S? No: M I S O S -> that would be: 1:M, 2:I, 3:S, 4:O, 5:S -> but we need the 4th to be S, so that doesn't fit.

Another: ""LISPS"": L I S P S -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:S, 4:P, 5:S -> but then the 4th is P, not S. So no.

So, ""TIPSY"" and ""DITSY"" are good candidates.

We could also try ""WISPY"": W I S P Y -> again, 3rd is S, not 4th.

So, the pattern [1] I [3] S [5] must have the 3rd position as a letter that is not S (because S is at 4th). So the word must have distinct positions.

In ""TIPSY"": 
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: Y

This is good.

Similarly, ""DITSY"": D I T S Y.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

In ""TIPSY"", we test T, P, Y.
In ""DITSY"", we test D, T, Y.

Both test T and Y. The difference is P vs D.

So the second guess is ""TIPSY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":

No: M I S O S -> that would be: 1:M, 2:I, 3:S, 4:O, 5:S -> but we need the 4th to be S, so that doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother: ""LISPS"": L I S P S -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:S, 4:P, 5:S -> but then the 4th is P, not S. So no.\n\nSo, ""TIPSY"" and ""DITSY"" are good candidates.\n\nWe could also try ""WISPY"": W I S P Y -> again, 3rd is S, not 4th.\n\nSo, the pattern [1] I [3] S [5] must have the 3rd position as a letter that is not S (because S is at 4th). So the word must have distinct positions.\n\nIn ""TIPSY"": \n- Position 1: T\n- Position 2: I\n- Position 3: P\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: Y\n\nThis is good.\n\nSimilarly, ""DITSY"": D I T S Y.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nIn ""TIPSY"", we test T, P, Y.\nIn ""DITSY"", we test D, T, Y.\n\nBoth test T and Y. The difference is P vs D.\n\nP is more common than D? Actually, in English, both are common. But we can choose either.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to include more vowels? But we know the word has I, and we don\'t know about other vowels. But we have eliminated A and E, so the remaining vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y (which is in both words).\n\nWe might also consider ""GIPSY"" (variant of gypsy) -> G I P S Y.\n\nBut let\'s stick to common words.\n\nAnother option: ""BISKS"" -> not common? ""BISK"" is not typically 5 letters.\n\nI think ""TIPSY"" is a good choice.\n\nBut note: we know I is in the word, but we don\'t know where. By putting I in the second position, we are testing if it is in the second position. If we get a ✓ for I, then we know it\'s in the second. If we get a -, then it\'s in the word but not in the second (and not in the third, so it must be in the first or fifth). If we get an x, that would be impossible because we know I is in the word. But the feedback for I in the first guess was \'-\' meaning it is in the word, so it must be in the word. Therefore, in the second guess, if we put I in the second position, we can get either ✓ or - (but not x).\n\nSo, ""TIPSY"" seems a good guess.\n\nWe can also consider ""PIOUS"" -> P I O U S -> but then S is the 5th, not 4th. So no.\n\nAnother word: ""BIOS"" is 4 letters.\n\nSo, I think ""TIPSY"" is a solid choice.\n\nLet me check if there are other words that use more common letters? For example, ""LISPS"" doesn\'t fit the pattern. ""MINIS"" -> M I N I S -> but then the 4th is I, not S. So no.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""TIPSY"".\n\nSo the second guess is ""TIPSY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, A, and E are not in the word (x).\n- I is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).\n- S is in the word and correctly placed in the 4th position (✓).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word contains I and S, with S fixed in the 4th position.\n- I must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is invalid and position 4 is occupied by S).\n- Avoid using R, A, or E in the next guess.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Keep S in the 4th position to maintain the known correct placement.\n- Test I in a new position (e.g., 2nd position) to gather more information about its location.\n- Introduce new, common consonants (like T, P, Y) to maximize feedback on untested letters.\n- ""TIPSY"" fits these criteria: \n  - Places I in the 2nd position (testing a new spot).\n  - Keeps S in the 4th position.\n  - Uses new letters (T, P, Y) and avoids R, A, E.\n  - It\'s a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of I and reveal if T, P, or Y are in the word.\n\n<guess>TIPSY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: TIPSY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(✓) P(x) S(✓) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(-), S(✓), E(x)
   Interpretation:
   - R, A, E are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
   - S is in the 4th position and correct.

2. Guess: TIPSY -> Feedback: T(x), I(✓), P(x), S(✓), Y(x)
   Interpretation:
   - T, P, Y are not in the word.
   - I is in the 2nd position and correct (since we got ✓ for I at position 2).
   - S is still correct in the 4th position.

Now we know the secret word has:
- I in the 2nd position.
- S in the 4th position.
- And from earlier, we eliminated R, A, E, T, P, Y as possible letters.

So the word structure is: [1st letter] I [3rd letter] S [5th letter]

We know the following letters are not in the word: R, A, E, T, P, Y (from previous feedback).

We need to choose a word that fits: _ I _ S _

We must avoid using letters that are eliminated: R, A, E, T, P, Y.

Also, we have only used and know the positions for I and S. We need to find the 1st, 3rd, and 5th letters.

Possible common consonants and vowels: since we have eliminated several letters, we should focus on remaining common letters. 
Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O (but O is a vowel), Q, U (vowel), V, W, X, Z.
Vowels left: O, U (since A,E are out, and I is used).

The word must have a 3rd and 5th letter, and we have not tested many yet.

We can try to include common letters that haven't been tested to get more information.

Letters not yet tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But we can't use all in one guess; we need to form a valid word.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ I _ S _

Possible candidates:
- Using B: ""BILKS"" - B I L K S -> but note, we have S in the 4th position? So [1]B, [2]I, [3]L, [4]S, [5]K? Wait, no: the pattern must have S in 4th, so if the word ends with K, then it's [5]K. But ""BILKS"": B I L K S -> positions: B(1), I(2), L(3), K(4), S(5) -> but we need S to be in the 4th position? Here S is in 5th. So that doesn't match.

We must have the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th=S, 5th. So the word ends with the 5th letter.

Examples:
- ""DISKS"" -> but we have D I S K S -> then S is in the 4th is correct? Actually: D(1), I(2), S(3), K(4), S(5). So [4] is K, not S? So [4] should be S. In this word, [4] is K, [5] is S, so S is at 5th, not 4th. So no.

We need the 4th letter to be S, so the word must be: letter1, I, letter3, S, letter5.

So pattern: [1] I [3] S [5]

Valid words:
- ""MINUS"": M I N U S -> but then [4] should be S? In ""MINUS"": M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5). So [4] is U, not S. So that doesn't work.

We need [4] to be S, so [3] is a different letter and [5] is another.

Examples:
- ""KICKS"": K I C K S -> K(1), I(2), C(3), K(4), S(5) -> but [4] is K, not S? So [4] is K, [5] is S, so S is at 5th. Not correct.

Let's find words where the 4th letter is S. So after I and one letter, then S, then another.

Possibly:
- ""FILMS"" -> F I L M S -> F(1), I(2), L(3), M(4), S(5) -> again, [4] is M, not S.

This seems a bit tricky. I recall some words like ""BISKS"" but that might not be common.

Another: ""DISKS"" doesn't work as above.

Perhaps ""FISTS"" -> F I S T S -> but then [3] is S? And [4] is T? Positions: F(1), I(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) → [4] is T, not S.

We need [3] to be a letter, [4] must be S.

So the pattern is: [1] I [3] S [5]

List of words that fit:
- ""WINKS"": W I N K S -> but [4] is K, [5] is S; not S in 4th.
- ""LIONS"" : L I O N S → [3]O, [4]N, [5]S → not S in 4th.
- ""GIFTS"" : G I F T S → [3]F, [4]T, [5]S → not S in 4th.

I am considering words like ""PIOUS"" but it has O U and ends with U S? P I O U S → [4]U.

Maybe ""BIOLS"" is not a word.

I recall ""MISDO"" is a word but it ends with S? M I S D O → no, 5 letters? Let's think.

Another word: ""DICKS"" → D I C K S → positions: D(1), I(2), C(3), K(4), S(5) → [4] is K.

But we need [4] to be S. So for example, if the word is ""FISHS"" it would be invalid; ""FISH"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""BICES"" but that might not be common or valid; BICES is a word? (plural of bice). But let's stick to common words.

I think there's ""WISES"" but W I S E S → [3]S, [4]E → not S at 4th.

Another: ""HISTS"" → H I S T S → same issue.

We might need to consider words where the fourth letter is S, but it's not common after I and another letter.

Perhaps ""VIEWS"" → V I E W S → but E is eliminated? We know E is not in the word.

We can't use E.

The only words that fit might be:
- ""KICKS"" etc. don't work.

Let me search mentally: what about ""DICKS"" no.

Another: ""MINKS"" → M I N K S → M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5) → so the fourth letter is K, not S.

Except if the word is ""I S something"", but the first letter is fixed.

Perhaps ""VISAS"" → V I S A S → but A is eliminated, and [3]S? Positions: V(1), I(2), S(3), A(4), S(5) → [4] is A, not S.

I am realizing that it's hard to find words with the pattern [1] I [3] S [5]. 

Alternatives: we know I in 2nd and S in 4th, but perhaps there are words like ""BIJOU"" etc., but no S at 4th.

Another idea: ""JIGS"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""VIGAS"" → not common.

Let's think of common words: how about ""DIMPS"" → no.

Or ""FIXES"" → F I X E S → E is out; and [4]E.

But we need S at 4th position.

Perhaps ""MIXES"" → U I uses, but with eliminated letters.

Since it's tough, maybe I recall incorrect. But we must find a word that has I in second and S in fourth.

What about ""BICES""? B I C E S → E and S at 5th? B(1), I(2), C(3), E(4), S(5) → not S at 4th.

Another: ""GIFTS"" as before.

Ah, I think ""LIFTS"" but same as FISTS.

Perhaps ""DISKS"" can be reconsidered? No.

Wait a minute, is there a word ""CISKS"" or something? No.

Perhaps ""WISPS"" → W I S P S → positions: W(1), I(2), S(3), P(4), S(5) → so [3] is S, [4] is P, not S.

We need the fourth letter to be S, not the fifth.

So the only way is to have a word where after the third letter comes S.

For example, a word like ""MARIS"" but M A R I S → not I at second.

With I at second: let's list all 5-letter words with I as second letter and S as fourth letter.

Common ones:
- ""AIOLI"" -> A I O L I → no S.
- ""BIOGS"" -> B I O G S → [4]G.
- ""CHOIR"" -> no.
- ""CLIPS"" -> C L I P S → but I is third? no, we need I second.

With I second and S fourth:

- ""DICKS"" not.
- ""GIPON"" not with S.
- ""HICKS"" H I C K S → [4]K.
- : apparently there are not many common words with this pattern.

But there must be some.

What about ""BIASM"" no.

Another: ""PIERS"" P I E R S → E is out, and [4]R, [5]S.
 or ""DIETS"" D I E T S → but E.

Perhaps ""QUINS"" Q U I N S → I is third, not second.

We should consider ""MUSS"" something, but not.

Wait, ""BISES"" -> B I S E S → but E and S at 4th is E? Positions: B(1), I(2), S(3), E(4), S(5) → [4]E.

Not working.

Perhaps ""WISPS"" again.

I recall ""LINKS"" L I N K S → [4]K.

But what about ""KINGS"" K I N G S → [4]G.

Same issue.

Another idea: the word ""FISH"" is 4 letters, but ""FIFIS"" is not a word.

Perhaps ""BIGGS"" not.

Let's not ignore the letter that might be in the word. Since we have limited options, we can consider the possibility that I we place S incorrectly to test other positions? But we know S is correctly in 4th, so it's not necessary to move it, but if no common word exists, we might have to choose a word that doesn't have S in 4th, but that might waste the guess? Not necessarily, because we can test other positions, but we know S is in 4th, so we should keep it.

But is it possible that the feedback was wrong? No, we trust the feedback.

Perhaps the word is ""OINKS"" O I N K S → [4]K.

Or ""MINIS"" M I N I S → [3]N, [4]I, [5] S — which would have the fourth letter I, not S.

So if we guess such a word, S would be at fifth, but we know S is in fourth, so it would show as '-' or 'x' for S, which would be inconsistent.

Let's stop and think differently. Perhaps we are missing something. Is there a word like ""IRONY"" but not matching.

Another word: ""VISIT"" V I S I T → has S at third. Not fourth.

But what about ""VIVIS"" not a word.

""BIBBS"" not.

Perhaps ""CIVIC"" but no S.

I think I found one: ""Dix it"" not.

Perhaps ""WICKS"" W I C K S → fourth K.

But then I remember ""DISCS"" D I S C S → positions: D(1), I(2), S(3), C(4), S(5) -> so the fourth letter is C, not S.

In this case, we need the fourth letter to be S, so for example, if the word is ""BASS "" but it's not 5 letters.

Another possibility: ""MIAOWS"" M I A O W S -> A and O are letters, but lengths: M(1), I(2), A(3), O(4), W(5)? ""MIAOW"" is 5 letters: M I A O W, not ending with S.

Perhaps we are forced to use less common words.

Let's search my memory: is there ""KIASU""? Not common.

Or ""PISCO"" P I S C O → P(1), I(2), S(3), C(4), O(5) — fourth is C.

Still not.

What about ""GISMO"" G I S M O -> fourth M.

Same issue.

Perhaps I think of "" BISON"" B I S O N -> B(1), I(2), S(3), O(4), N(5) — fourth is O, not S.

Unless the word has the fourth letter S.

For example, ""RAISE"" has S in fourth, but we already guessed that.

Another word with S in fourth: ""HOUSE"" H O U S E — or ""MOUSE"" etc. But those have O or U, and I not at second.

With I at second: "" _ I _ S _ "".

Let's go online in my mind: perhaps ""AIDOS"" A I D O S -> fourth O.

""BIROS"" B I R O S — fourth O.

""CILLS"" not.

"" DIOLS"" D I O L S -> fourth L.

Still not.

""FIATS"" F I A T S -> fourth T.

""GIROS"" G I R O S -> fourth O.

""HIJKS"" not.

""JIBES"" J I B E S -> fourth E.

""KINES"" K I N E S -> fourth E.

"" LIEFS"" L I E F S -> fourth F.

""MILTS"" M I L T S -> fourth T.

"" NILLS"" not.

""PIKAS"" P I K A S -> fourth A.

""QIANS"" not.

"" RICES"" eliminated or R.

""TOILS"" T and O, but T is out.

""UPPER"" not with I.

""VINEG"" not.

""WIDES"" W I D E S -> fourth E.

 ""XERUS"" X E R U S -> not.

""Yipes"" Y I P E S -> fourth E.

 ZIL a not.

So common words seem not to have this pattern easily.

But we know S is in fourth, and I is in second, so the word must exist. Perhaps ""bitsy"" but ""B ITSY"" B I T S Y, but T and Y are out — from second guess, T and Y are not in the word, and P is also out.

In ""TIPSY"", T and Y and P are x, so not in the word.

In ""BITSY"": B I T S Y — this has T and Y, which are eliminated. So we can't use that.

Similarly, ""DITSY"" has D I T S Y — T and Y out.

""GIPSY"" G I P S Y — P and Y out.

So we cannot use these because they contain eliminated letters.

Therefore, we need a word with pattern [1] I [3] S [5], and the letters in 1,3,5 are not from the eliminated list and form a valid word.

Eliminated letters: R, A, E, T, P, Y.

So available letters for 1,3,5: B, C, D, F, G, H, I (but I is already used), but the word has I and S, so the other three letters must be different.

Possible: let's try to form:
For position 3 and 5: since S is in 4th, position 3 can be many letters, but we need a valid word.

Examples: 
- ""FIGS"" is 4 letters.

Or ""FIDS"" not word.

""BIGS"" short.

""LIGS"" short.

Perhaps "" 5-letter words ending with 'is' something"", but the third letter and the fifth.

Words like ""minis"" but ends with is, but ""minis"" is M I N I S -> [3]N, [4]I, [5]S — not S in fourth.

I think I found one: ""discs"" is D I S C S, but it has S at 3 and 5, not 4.

Another: ""fiscs"" not common.

Perhaps we have to use ""bices"" B I C E S, but E is eliminated.

Or ""biles"" B I L E S, with E not allowed.

Since A,E,I,O,U, -- we have used I, and A and E are out, so only O and U as vowels left.

So the word must have O or U or a consonant only.

For example, ""DINOS"" D I N O S -> positions: D(1), I(2), N(3), O(4), S(5), so fourth is O, not S.

If we want S in fourth, it must be that the fifth part has no vowel needed or something.

Perhaps ""MUSIC"" M U S I C -> I in fourth? Not second.

What about ""OASIS"" not with I second.

I think this is challenging. Perhaps the only possibility is that the secret word has repeated letters, but S is already in fourth, so for and the third letter could be S? But we know that in ""RAISE"", the S was in fourth and correct; also in ""TIPSY"", S was correct in fourth.

But if the word has S in third and fifth? Then in ""RAISE"", when we had S in fourth, it would not have been correct, but it was correct, so S is only in fourth position.

So back to the pattern.

I recall the word ""GISMO"" is also ""GIZMO"", but G I Z M O -- fourth M.

Not.

Another word: ""LIKES"" L I K E S, but E is out.

Perhaps ""LIVID"" L I V I D -- no S.

Or ""CIVIL"" C I V I L -- no S.

We need S in the word, but at fourth position.

Perhaps ""BISKS"" is accepted? B I S K S -- B(1), I(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -- fourth is K, not S.

If we force S in fourth, the only common word I can think of is ""WISPS"" but as before.

Perhaps ""VISES"" V I S E S -- has S in third and fifth, fourth is E.

But E is eliminated.

Unless the word is ""DISCO"" and we add S, but no.

Another idea: ""RISUS"" R is eliminated.

Perhaps ""FICUS"" F I C U S -- F(1), I(2), C(3), U(4), S(5) -- fourth U not S.

So not.

When at position, the word ""bises"" is B I S E S, but S at third and fifth.

But we know from ""RAISE"" that when we placed S in fourth, it was correct, so in the secret word, the fourth letter is S and not third or fifth.

Therefore, it must be that the third letter is not S.

Let's list the possible secret words that fit:
- The word has I in position 2, S in position 4, and letters in 1,3,5 from the available set.

Available letters: BCDFGHJKLMNOQUVWXZ (since R,A,E,T,P,Y are out).

We need constraints: the word must be valid.

Possible secret words include:
- ""BICEP"" is 5 letters? B I C E P -- but E and P are out.

P is out from ""TIPSY"" feedback.

""BIDES"" with B I D E, E out.

""BILES"" E out.

""BIMAS"" M in third, but B A? The word is B I M A S -- positions B(1), I(2), M(3), A(4), S(5) -- but A is out, and fourth is not S.

We need fourth to be S, so for example, B I M S A -- but that's B(1), I(2), M(3), S(4), A(5) -- but A in 5th is out.

Not.

""BINKS"" K not tested; B I N K S -- B(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5) -- [4]K.

Same problem.

Perhaps ""BIFFS"" B I F F S -- positions: B(1), I(2), F(3), F(4), S(5) -- but then S is in 5th, not 4th; and F is in 3rd and 4th.

But [4] is F, not S.

So unacceptable.

Unless the secret word is ""BIF S K"" but not.

I think I found one: ""licks"" L I C K S, but L I C K S -- L(1), I(2), C(3), K(4), S(5) -- S in 5th.

Nearly all candidate words have S in 5th position, not 4th.

Is there any word with S in 4th and I in 2nd?

For example, ""  systems"" not.

Another: ""pious "" P I O U S - S at 5th.

"" joyous"" J O Y O U S, not.

Perhaps "" "" with hyphen or something.

Let's consider ""BILLS"" B I L L S -- positions B(1), I(2), L(3), L(4), S(5) -- so S in 5th.

Or ""BUILS"" not.

Unless the word is ""DIVAS"" but I in third.

Perhaps ""KI OSK"" kiosk is 5 letters: K I O S K -- K(1), I(2), O(3), S(4), K(5) -- ah! Here it is: S is in the 4th position!

Yes! ""KIOSK""!

But in ""KIOSK"":
- Position 1: K
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: K

And K is not eliminated; we haven't tested K before.

Also, O is a vowel, available.

And no eliminated letters: R,A,E,T,P,Y are out; K and O are new.

So ""KIOSK"" is a valid guess.

Other possibilities? ""MIOSK"" not a word.

""CIOSK"" not common, ""KIOSK"" is common.

Another option: "" G IOS ג not, but ""ALIOS"" A eliminated.

So ""KIOSK"" is a good candidate for the secret word or for a guess.

But we can use it as a guess.

In this case, for guess 3, we can guess ""KIOSK"".

But note that the secret word might not be ""KIOSK"", but it fits the criteria.

Also, by guessing ""KIOSK"", we can test the letters.

If the secret word is ""KIOSK"", we win.

Otherwise, feedback will tell us about K and O.

Specifically, since we have I in 2nd and S in 4th, if we get K in 1st and K in 5th, but K at position 1 and 5 might not be the same in the secret word.

But at least, we can get information on K and O.

Moreover, it fits the pattern and uses new letters.

Other words? ""NISUS"" N I S U S - S in 3rd and 5th.

Not S in 4th.

""LISLE"" L I S L E - E out.

So ""KIOSK"" seems a solid choice.

Therefore, for the third guess, I'll go with ""KIOSK"".
</think>
Based on the cumulative feedback:

- From Guess 1 (RAISE): R, A, and E are eliminated (x), I is in the word but not in position 3 (-), and S is confirmed in position 4 (✓).
- From Guess 2 (TIPSY): T, P, and Y are eliminated (x), I is confirmed in position 2 (✓), and S is reconfirmed in position 4 (✓).

Key deductions:
- The secret word must have I in position 2 and S in position 4, so the pattern is `[1] I [3] S [5]`.
- Eliminated letters (cannot appear): R, A, E, T, P, Y.
- Letters not yet tested include B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. O and U are remaining vowels.

For the next guess:
- Must keep I in position 2 and S in position 4 to preserve confirmed placements.
- Focus on testing new common letters in positions 1, 3, and 5 to gather maximum feedback.
- ""KIOSK"" fits perfectly: 
  - Pattern: K (position 1), I (position 2), O (position 3), S (position 4), K (position 5).
  - Tests new letters K and O.
  - Avoids all eliminated letters (K and O are untested, so they are valid).
  - Valid English word (meaning: a small booth for selling goods).
- This guess efficiently tests position 1 with K, position 3 with O, and position 5 with K while leveraging known positions.

If K or O appear in the feedback, it narrows possibilities significantly; if not, they can be quickly eliminated for future guesses.

<guess>KIOSK</guess>",KIOSK,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(-), S(✓), E(x)
   Interpretation:
   - R, A, E are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
   - S is in the 4th position and correct.

2. Guess: TIPSY -> Feedback: T(x), I(✓), P(x), S(✓), Y(x)
   Interpretation:
   - T, P, Y are not in the word.
   - I is in the 2nd position and correct (since we got ✓ for I at position 2).
   - S is still correct in the 4th position.

Now we know the secret word has:
- I in the 2nd position.
- S in the 4th position.
- And from earlier, we eliminated R, A, E, T, P, Y as possible letters.

So the word structure is: [1st letter] I [3rd letter] S [5th letter]

We know the following letters are not in the word: R, A, E, T, P, Y (from previous feedback).

We need to choose a word that fits: _ I _ S _

We must avoid using letters that are eliminated: R, A, E, T, P, Y.

Also, we have only used and know the positions for I and S. We need to find the 1st, 3rd, and 5th letters.

Possible common consonants and vowels: since we have eliminated several letters, we should focus on remaining common letters. 
Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O (but O is a vowel), Q, U (vowel), V, W, X, Z.
Vowels left: O, U (since A,E are out, and I is used).

The word must have a 3rd and 5th letter, and we have not tested many yet.

We can try to include common letters that haven't been tested to get more information.

Letters not yet tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But we can't use all in one guess; we need to form a valid word.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ I _ S _

Possible candidates:
- Using B: ""BILKS"" - B I L K S -> but note, we have S in the 4th position? So [1]B, [2]I, [3]L, [4]S, [5]K? Wait, no: the pattern must have S in 4th, so if the word ends with K, then it's [5]K. But ""BILKS"": B I L K S -> positions: B(1), I(2), L(3), K(4), S(5) -> but we need S to be in the 4th position? Here S is in 5th. So that doesn't match.

We must have the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th=S, 5th. So the word ends with the 5th letter.

Examples:
- ""DISKS"" -> but we have D I S K S -> then S is in the 4th is correct? Actually: D(1), I(2), S(3), K(4), S(5). So [4] is K, not S? So [4] should be S. In this word, [4] is K, [5] is S, so S is at 5th, not 4th. So no.

We need the 4th letter to be S, so the word must be: letter1, I, letter3, S, letter5.

So pattern: [1] I [3] S [5]

Valid words:
- ""MINUS"": M I N U S -> but then [4] should be S? In ""MINUS"": M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5). So [4] is U, not S. So that doesn't work.

We need [4] to be S, so [3] is a different letter and [5] is another.

Examples:
- ""KICKS"": K I C K S -> K(1), I(2), C(3), K(4), S(5) -> but [4] is K, not S? So [4] is K, [5] is S, so S is at 5th. Not correct.

Let's find words where the 4th letter is S. So after I and one letter, then S, then another.

Possibly:
- ""FILMS"" -> F I L M S -> F(1), I(2), L(3), M(4), S(5) -> again, [4] is M, not S.

This seems a bit tricky. I recall some words like ""BISKS"" but that might not be common.

Another: ""DISKS"" doesn't work as above.

Perhaps ""FISTS"" -> F I S T S -> but then [3] is S? And [4] is T? Positions: F(1), I(2), S(3), T(4), S(5) → [4] is T, not S.

We need [3] to be a letter, [4] must be S.

So the pattern is: [1] I [3] S [5]

List of words that fit:
- ""WINKS"": W I N K S -> but [4] is K, [5] is S; not S in 4th.
- ""LIONS"" : L I O N S → [3]O, [4]N, [5]S → not S in 4th.
- ""GIFTS"" : G I F T S → [3]F, [4]T, [5]S → not S in 4th.

I am considering words like ""PIOUS"" but it has O U and ends with U S? P I O U S → [4]U.

Maybe ""BIOLS"" is not a word.

I recall ""MISDO"" is a word but it ends with S? M I S D O → no, 5 letters? Let's think.

Another word: ""DICKS"" → D I C K S → positions: D(1), I(2), C(3), K(4), S(5) → [4] is K.

But we need [4] to be S. So for example, if the word is ""FISHS"" it would be invalid; ""FISH"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""BICES"" but that might not be common or valid; BICES is a word? (plural of bice). But let's stick to common words.

I think there's ""WISES"" but W I S E S → [3]S, [4]E → not S at 4th.

Another: ""HISTS"" → H I S T S → same issue.

We might need to consider words where the fourth letter is S, but it's not common after I and another letter.

Perhaps ""VIEWS"" → V I E W S → but E is eliminated? We know E is not in the word.

We can't use E.

The only words that fit might be:
- ""KICKS"" etc. don't work.

Let me search mentally: what about ""DICKS"" no.

Another: ""MINKS"" → M I N K S → M(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5) → so the fourth letter is K, not S.

Except if the word is ""I S something"", but the first letter is fixed.

Perhaps ""VISAS"" → V I S A S → but A is eliminated, and [3]S? Positions: V(1), I(2), S(3), A(4), S(5) → [4] is A, not S.

I am realizing that it's hard to find words with the pattern [1] I [3] S [5]. 

Alternatives: we know I in 2nd and S in 4th, but perhaps there are words like ""BIJOU"" etc., but no S at 4th.

Another idea: ""JIGS"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""VIGAS"" → not common.

Let's think of common words: how about ""DIMPS"" → no.

Or ""FIXES"" → F I X E S → E is out; and [4]E.

But we need S at 4th position.

Perhaps ""MIXES"" → U I uses, but with eliminated letters.

Since it's tough, maybe I recall incorrect. But we must find a word that has I in second and S in fourth.

What about ""BICES""? B I C E S → E and S at 5th? B(1), I(2), C(3), E(4), S(5) → not S at 4th.

Another: ""GIFTS"" as before.

Ah, I think ""LIFTS"" but same as FISTS.

Perhaps ""DISKS"" can be reconsidered? No.

Wait a minute, is there a word ""CISKS"" or something? No.

Perhaps ""WISPS"" → W I S P S → positions: W(1), I(2), S(3), P(4), S(5) → so [3] is S, [4] is P, not S.

We need the fourth letter to be S, not the fifth.

So the only way is to have a word where after the third letter comes S.

For example, a word like ""MARIS"" but M A R I S → not I at second.

With I at second: let's list all 5-letter words with I as second letter and S as fourth letter.

Common ones:
- ""AIOLI"" -> A I O L I → no S.
- ""BIOGS"" -> B I O G S → [4]G.
- ""CHOIR"" -> no.
- ""CLIPS"" -> C L I P S → but I is third? no, we need I second.

With I second and S fourth:

- ""DICKS"" not.
- ""GIPON"" not with S.
- ""HICKS"" H I C K S → [4]K.
- : apparently there are not many common words with this pattern.

But there must be some.

What about ""BIASM"" no.

Another: ""PIERS"" P I E R S → E is out, and [4]R, [5]S.
 or ""DIETS"" D I E T S → but E.

Perhaps ""QUINS"" Q U I N S → I is third, not second.

We should consider ""MUSS"" something, but not.

Wait, ""BISES"" -> B I S E S → but E and S at 4th is E? Positions: B(1), I(2), S(3), E(4), S(5) → [4]E.

Not working.

Perhaps ""WISPS"" again.

I recall ""LINKS"" L I N K S → [4]K.

But what about ""KINGS"" K I N G S → [4]G.

Same issue.

Another idea: the word ""FISH"" is 4 letters, but ""FIFIS"" is not a word.

Perhaps ""BIGGS"" not.

Let's not ignore the letter that might be in the word. Since we have limited options, we can consider the possibility that I we place S incorrectly to test other positions? But we know S is correctly in 4th, so it's not necessary to move it, but if no common word exists, we might have to choose a word that doesn't have S in 4th, but that might waste the guess? Not necessarily, because we can test other positions, but we know S is in 4th, so we should keep it.

But is it possible that the feedback was wrong? No, we trust the feedback.

Perhaps the word is ""OINKS"" O I N K S → [4]K.

Or ""MINIS"" M I N I S → [3]N, [4]I, [5] S — which would have the fourth letter I, not S.

So if we guess such a word, S would be at fifth, but we know S is in fourth, so it would show as '-' or 'x' for S, which would be inconsistent.

Let's stop and think differently. Perhaps we are missing something. Is there a word like ""IRONY"" but not matching.

Another word: ""VISIT"" V I S I T → has S at third. Not fourth.

But what about ""VIVIS"" not a word.

""BIBBS"" not.

Perhaps ""CIVIC"" but no S.

I think I found one: ""Dix it"" not.

Perhaps ""WICKS"" W I C K S → fourth K.

But then I remember ""DISCS"" D I S C S → positions: D(1), I(2), S(3), C(4), S(5) -> so the fourth letter is C, not S.

In this case, we need the fourth letter to be S, so for example, if the word is ""BASS "" but it's not 5 letters.

Another possibility: ""MIAOWS"" M I A O W S -> A and O are letters, but lengths: M(1), I(2), A(3), O(4), W(5)? ""MIAOW"" is 5 letters: M I A O W, not ending with S.

Perhaps we are forced to use less common words.

Let's search my memory: is there ""KIASU""? Not common.

Or ""PISCO"" P I S C O → P(1), I(2), S(3), C(4), O(5) — fourth is C.

Still not.

What about ""GISMO"" G I S M O -> fourth M.

Same issue.

Perhaps I think of "" BISON"" B I S O N -> B(1), I(2), S(3), O(4), N(5) — fourth is O, not S.

Unless the word has the fourth letter S.

For example, ""RAISE"" has S in fourth, but we already guessed that.

Another word with S in fourth: ""HOUSE"" H O U S E — or ""MOUSE"" etc. But those have O or U, and I not at second.

With I at second: "" _ I _ S _ "".

Let's go online in my mind: perhaps ""AIDOS"" A I D O S -> fourth O.

""BIROS"" B I R O S — fourth O.

""CILLS"" not.

"" DIOLS"" D I O L S -> fourth L.

Still not.

""FIATS"" F I A T S -> fourth T.

""GIROS"" G I R O S -> fourth O.

""HIJKS"" not.

""JIBES"" J I B E S -> fourth E.

""KINES"" K I N E S -> fourth E.

"" LIEFS"" L I E F S -> fourth F.

""MILTS"" M I L T S -> fourth T.

"" NILLS"" not.

""PIKAS"" P I K A S -> fourth A.

""QIANS"" not.

"" RICES"" eliminated or R.

""TOILS"" T and O, but T is out.

""UPPER"" not with I.

""VINEG"" not.

""WIDES"" W I D E S -> fourth E.

 ""XERUS"" X E R U S -> not.

""Yipes"" Y I P E S -> fourth E.

 ZIL a not.

So common words seem not to have this pattern easily.

But we know S is in fourth, and I is in second, so the word must exist. Perhaps ""bitsy"" but ""B ITSY"" B I T S Y, but T and Y are out — from second guess, T and Y are not in the word, and P is also out.

In ""TIPSY"", T and Y and P are x, so not in the word.

In ""BITSY"": B I T S Y — this has T and Y, which are eliminated. So we can't use that.

Similarly, ""DITSY"" has D I T S Y — T and Y out.

""GIPSY"" G I P S Y — P and Y out.

So we cannot use these because they contain eliminated letters.

Therefore, we need a word with pattern [1] I [3] S [5], and the letters in 1,3,5 are not from the eliminated list and form a valid word.

Eliminated letters: R, A, E, T, P, Y.

So available letters for 1,3,5: B, C, D, F, G, H, I (but I is already used), but the word has I and S, so the other three letters must be different.

Possible: let's try to form:
For position 3 and 5: since S is in 4th, position 3 can be many letters, but we need a valid word.

Examples: 
- ""FIGS"" is 4 letters.

Or ""FIDS"" not word.

""BIGS"" short.

""LIGS"" short.

Perhaps "" 5-letter words ending with 'is' something"", but the third letter and the fifth.

Words like ""minis"" but ends with is, but ""minis"" is M I N I S -> [3]N, [4]I, [5]S — not S in fourth.

I think I found one: ""discs"" is D I S C S, but it has S at 3 and 5, not 4.

Another: ""fiscs"" not common.

Perhaps we have to use ""bices"" B I C E S, but E is eliminated.

Or ""biles"" B I L E S, with E not allowed.

Since A,E,I,O,U, -- we have used I, and A and E are out, so only O and U as vowels left.

So the word must have O or U or a consonant only.

For example, ""DINOS"" D I N O S -> positions: D(1), I(2), N(3), O(4), S(5), so fourth is O, not S.

If we want S in fourth, it must be that the fifth part has no vowel needed or something.

Perhaps ""MUSIC"" M U S I C -> I in fourth? Not second.

What about ""OASIS"" not with I second.

I think this is challenging. Perhaps the only possibility is that the secret word has repeated letters, but S is already in fourth, so for and the third letter could be S? But we know that in ""RAISE"", the S was in fourth and correct; also in ""TIPSY"", S was correct in fourth.

But if the word has S in third and fifth? Then in ""RAISE"", when we had S in fourth, it would not have been correct, but it was correct, so S is only in fourth position.

So back to the pattern.

I recall the word ""GISMO"" is also ""GIZMO"", but G I Z M O -- fourth M.

Not.

Another word: ""LIKES"" L I K E S, but E is out.

Perhaps ""LIVID"" L I V I D -- no S.

Or ""CIVIL"" C I V I L -- no S.

We need S in the word, but at fourth position.

Perhaps ""BISKS"" is accepted? B I S K S -- B(1), I(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -- fourth is K, not S.

If we force S in fourth, the only common word I can think of is ""WISPS"" but as before.

Perhaps ""VISES"" V I S E S -- has S in third and fifth, fourth is E.

But E is eliminated.

Unless the word is ""DISCO"" and we add S, but no.

Another idea: ""RISUS"" R is eliminated.

Perhaps ""FICUS"" F I C U S -- F(1), I(2), C(3), U(4), S(5) -- fourth U not S.

So not.

When at position, the word ""bises"" is B I S E S, but S at third and fifth.

But we know from ""RAISE"" that when we placed S in fourth, it was correct, so in the secret word, the fourth letter is S and not third or fifth.

Therefore, it must be that the third letter is not S.

Let's list the possible secret words that fit:
- The word has I in position 2, S in position 4, and letters in 1,3,5 from the available set.

Available letters: BCDFGHJKLMNOQUVWXZ (since R,A,E,T,P,Y are out).

We need constraints: the word must be valid.

Possible secret words include:
- ""BICEP"" is 5 letters? B I C E P -- but E and P are out.

P is out from ""TIPSY"" feedback.

""BIDES"" with B I D E, E out.

""BILES"" E out.

""BIMAS"" M in third, but B A? The word is B I M A S -- positions B(1), I(2), M(3), A(4), S(5) -- but A is out, and fourth is not S.

We need fourth to be S, so for example, B I M S A -- but that's B(1), I(2), M(3), S(4), A(5) -- but A in 5th is out.

Not.

""BINKS"" K not tested; B I N K S -- B(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), S(5) -- [4]K.

Same problem.

Perhaps ""BIFFS"" B I F F S -- positions: B(1), I(2), F(3), F(4), S(5) -- but then S is in 5th, not 4th; and F is in 3rd and 4th.

But [4] is F, not S.

So unacceptable.

Unless the secret word is ""BIF S K"" but not.

I think I found one: ""licks"" L I C K S, but L I C K S -- L(1), I(2), C(3), K(4), S(5) -- S in 5th.

Nearly all candidate words have S in 5th position, not 4th.

Is there any word with S in 4th and I in 2nd?

For example, ""  systems"" not.

Another: ""pious "" P I O U S - S at 5th.

"" joyous"" J O Y O U S, not.

Perhaps "" "" with hyphen or something.

Let's consider ""BILLS"" B I L L S -- positions B(1), I(2), L(3), L(4), S(5) -- so S in 5th.

Or ""BUILS"" not.

Unless the word is ""DIVAS"" but I in third.

Perhaps ""KI OSK"" kiosk is 5 letters: K I O S K -- K(1), I(2), O(3), S(4), K(5) -- ah! Here it is: S is in the 4th position!

Yes! ""KIOSK""!

But in ""KIOSK"":
- Position 1: K
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: K

And K is not eliminated; we haven't tested K before.

Also, O is a vowel, available.

And no eliminated letters: R,A,E,T,P,Y are out; K and O are new.

So ""KIOSK"" is a valid guess.

Other possibilities? ""MIOSK"" not a word.

""CIOSK"" not common, ""KIOSK"" is common.

Another option: "" G IOS ג not, but ""ALIOS"" A eliminated.

So ""KIOSK"" is a good candidate for the secret word or for a guess.

But we can use it as a guess.

In this case, for guess 3, we can guess ""KIOSK"".

But note that the secret word might not be ""KIOSK"", but it fits the criteria.

Also, by guessing ""KIOSK"", we can test the letters.

If the secret word is ""KIOSK"", we win.

Otherwise, feedback will tell us about K and O.

Specifically, since we have I in 2nd and S in 4th, if we get K in 1st and K in 5th, but K at position 1 and 5 might not be the same in the secret word.

But at least, we can get information on K and O.

Moreover, it fits the pattern and uses new letters.

Other words? ""NISUS"" N I S U S - S in 3rd and 5th.

Not S in 4th.

""LISLE"" L I S L E - E out.

So ""KIOSK"" seems a solid choice.

Therefore, for the third guess, I'll go with ""KIOSK"".Based on the cumulative feedback:

- From Guess 1 (RAISE): R, A, and E are eliminated (x), I is in the word but not in position 3 (-), and S is confirmed in position 4 (✓).
- From Guess 2 (TIPSY): T, P, and Y are eliminated (x), I is confirmed in position 2 (✓), and S is reconfirmed in position 4 (✓).

Key deductions:
- The secret word must have I in position 2 and S in position 4, so the pattern is `[1] I [3] S [5]`.
- Eliminated letters (cannot appear): R, A, E, T, P, Y.
- Letters not yet tested include B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. O and U are remaining vowels.

For the next guess:
- Must keep I in position 2 and S in position 4 to preserve confirmed placements.
- Focus on testing new common letters in positions 1, 3, and 5 to gather maximum feedback.
- ""KIOSK"" fits perfectly: 
  - Pattern: K (position 1), I (position 2), O (position 3), S (position 4), K (position 5).
  - Tests new letters K and O.
  - Avoids all eliminated letters (K and O are untested, so they are valid).
  - Valid English word (meaning: a small booth for selling goods).
- This guess efficiently tests position 1 with K, position 3 with O, and position 5 with K while leveraging known positions.

If K or O appear in the feedback, it narrows possibilities significantly; if not, they can be quickly eliminated for future guesses.",Guess 3: KIOSK -> FEEDBACK: K(✓) I(✓) O(✓) S(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
