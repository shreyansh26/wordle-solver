We are playing wordle and I need to make my first guess.
 Since I have no information, I want a word that has common letters to maximize feedback.
 A good starting word often uses common letters like vowels (A,E,I,O,U) and common consonants (R,S,T,L,N).
 Also, avoiding repeating letters might help get more information.

 Let me think of a word that includes several common letters. 
 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has C,R,A,N,E. But let's check alternatives.

 Another common one is ""SLATE"" which has S,L,A,T,E. 

 However, let's try to cover more different letters. I recall that ""ROATE"" or ""SOARE"" are sometimes used but they are less common.

 But note: the rules don't specify that the word must be common, but it must be valid.

 However, since the feedback uses 5 letters and we are trying to maximize information, let me consider:

 - Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now)
 - Consonants: R, S, T, L, N are very common.

 A word that covers many of these is ""RAISE"" -> R, A, I, S, E. It has three vowels (A,I,E) and two common consonants (R,S).

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" has C,R,A,N,E: two vowels (A,E) and three consonants.

 Perhaps ""RAISE"" is a little better because it has three vowels? But note that the position of vowels might matter.

 After checking, ""RAISE"" is a valid English word (meaning to lift up).

 Therefore, I will choose ""RAISE"" as the first guess.

 Response format:

I need to make an effective first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and vowels. 

- **Common letters**: English words frequently use vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.  
- **Strategy**: Prioritize a word with **3 vowels and 2 common consonants** to increase chances of hitting letters in the secret word.  
- **Choice**: ""RAISE"" is ideal—it contains **R, A, I, S, E**. This covers:  
  - 3 vowels (A, I, E)  
  - 2 high-frequency consonants (R, S)  
  - No duplicate letters, ensuring each letter provides unique feedback.  

This guess will help reveal which letters exist and their positions, setting a strong foundation for subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
 R(x) -> R is not in the word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the word.
 I(x) -> I is not in the word.
 S(✓) -> S is in the word and in the correct position? Wait, the symbol is '✓' meaning correct position? But in the example, ✓ means correct position.

 However, looking back at the rules: ✓ means the letter is in the word and in the correct position.

 But note: in the feedback for ""raise"", we have S(✓) meaning that S is in the secret word and it is at the same position as in ""raise"", that is, the fourth position (index 3, counting from 0?).

 Also, note that R, A, I, E are all absent.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The letter S is present and is the fourth letter of the secret word (so the word ends with ...S? Actually, no, it's the fourth letter, meaning position 3?).

 But note: the word is 5 letters. So positions: 0,1,2,3,4.
 Since ""raise"" was R-A-I-S-E, the S is at position 3.

 Therefore, the secret word has S as its fourth letter (position 3).

 And R, A, I, E are absent.

 So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, E. Also, it does contain S at position 3.

 Since E is absent, common vowels A, E, I are out. So the secret word must have other vowels? Or it might not? English words must have vowels, so likely vowels: O, U, sometimes Y (if allowed, but typically Wordle uses common words so Y might be allowed).

 However, we are not told that Y is always allowed? But the rules say ""valid 5-letter English word"". So let's consider O, U, and Y (if it's a vowel).

 Now, for the next guess:
 - We must have a word that has S at position 3 (index 3) because we know S is fixed at that position? But note: we don't know the positions of other letters, but S can't be moved? Actually, we can try words that have S at position 3 to get more feedback.

 However, we also know that the word cannot contain R, A, I, E.

 So, when constructing the next word:
 - Must be a 5-letter English word.
 - Must have S at the 4th position (index 3).
 - Must not use R, A, I, E.

 What letters are left? Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Note O and U are vowels.

 Since we don't have many vowels left, we might want to include O or U to see if they are in the word.

 Also, note that S is the only letter we know so far.

 Let's think of words that satisfy:
 - Position 3 (the fourth character) must be S.
 - The other letters: no R, A, I, E.

 Some options:

 Option 1: Try words with O and U? Or common consonants?

 Example: ""FOCUS"" -> F at 0, O at 1, C at 2, U at 4? But wait, position 3 must be S? So ""FOCUS"" doesn't have S at position 3? It ends with U-S? Actually, ""FOCUS"" has letters: 
 0: F, 1: O, 2: C, 3: U, 4: S -> but wait, we need the fourth letter (position 3) to be S? In ""FOCUS"", position 3 is U and position 4 is S? That doesn't match.

 Actually, we need S at position 3 (which is the fourth position in a 5-letter string, since indexing starts at 0: positions 0,1,2,3,4). So S must be at index 3.

 Example: ""HOSTS"" -> but has duplicate S? And S at index 3? Let's break down: 
 H-O-S-T-S? Positions: 0:H, 1:O, 2:S, 3:T, 4:S -> No, the S at index 3 would be T? Actually, no: the word is 5 letters: ""HOSTS"" -> 
 H (0), O (1), S (2), T (3), S (4) -> So index 3 is T? Then not S at index 3.

 We need a word where the character at index 3 is S.

 Examples of words that end with ...S? But note: index 3 is the fourth letter, so the fifth letter can be anything? Actually, the word could be like X X X S X.

 For instance: ""BONUS"" -> B (0), O (1), N (2), U (3), S (4) -> index 3 is U? So that's not S.

 How about ""DENTS"" -> D (0), E (1), N (2), T (3), S (4) -> index 3 is T? No.

 Or ""LANTS"" -> L-A-N-T-S? That's not a common word.

 Actually, let me think: words with the fourth letter S? That would be words ending in 'S'? Not necessarily, because position 3 is the fourth character? For example: ""CRASS"" -> C-R-A-S-S? Then: 
 Index 0: C
 Index 1: R -> but R is forbidden? We know R is absent.

 Since R is absent, we can't use R.

 Another example: ""COSTS"" -> C-O-S-T-S? That's C at index 0, O at 1, S at 2, T at 3, S at 4. So index 3 is T? Then not S.

 How about ""JUMPS"" -> J-U-M-P-S: 
 J(0), U(1), M(2), P(3), S(4) -> index 3 P? Not S.

 Actually, we need the letter at index 3 to be S. So the word must end with 'S'? Only if index 3 is the fourth character and index 4 is fifth, so the word pattern is _ _ _ S _

 But wait: the word ends at index 4? So it's not necessarily the last letter? Example: ""CHAOS"" -> C-H-A-O-S: 
 index 0: C, 1: H, 2: A -> forbidden (A absent), 3: O, 4: S? So index 3 is O.

 How about ""FUSSY"": F-U-S-S-Y -> 
 F(0), U(1), S(2), S(3), Y(4) -> This has S at index 3? Yes!

 However, we also have S at index 2? That's duplicate S? But we don't know how many S the secret word has. Our feedback only said one S at index 3? Actually, in the first guess, we only had one S and it was correct. But the word could have more S? However, our feedback didn't show any other S? But our guess only had one S.

 Actually, the word ""raise"" only had one S. So the feedback for S was correct at index 3? That doesn't say about duplicate S? Wait: if the secret word had another S at another position? Then in the first guess we didn't guess an S at that position? So it wouldn't show up? This is tricky.

 According to the rules: the feedback for each letter is independent? Actually, no: I recall in Wordle, if there is a duplicate letter, it can be marked only if it appears that many times? But let me recall the exact rule:

 Typically: 
 - If a letter is in the word and in the correct position, it gets ✓.
 - If a letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets -.
 - But if a letter appears more times in the guess than in the secret word, then the excess will be marked as x.

 However, in our feedback for ""raise"", we have R(x), A(x), I(x), S(✓), E(x). Since we didn't have any other S, we cannot be sure if there are multiple S? So it's possible.

 But here, since we know S is at index 3, we must choose a word that has S at index 3? And we are free to choose other letters? We should avoid R, A, I, E.

 So for next guess, we want:
 - A word that has S at position 3 (index 3).
 - Does not contain R, A, I, E.
 - And we want to test other common letters? Like consonants? Or vowels O, U, Y.

 So let me think of words that fit: pattern _ _ _ S _ (where the fifth character can be anything).

 For example:
 - ""PULPS"": P-U-L-P-S -> index 3 is P? no, index 3 would be the fourth letter: so letters 0:P, 1:U, 2:L, 3:P, 4:S -> index 3 is P? Not S.

 Correction: the pattern must have the fourth letter (index 3) be S.

 How about:
 ""TONUS"" -> T-O-N-U-S? But then index 3 is U? not S.

 ""MOUSE"": M-O-U-S-E -> 
 M(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), E(4) -> Ah! index 3 is S? Yes. But wait: E is absent? We know E is absent? So we can't have E at the end? Because feedback told us E is not in the word? So ""MOUSE"" has E? So it's invalid because we know E is absent? And also we don't want to use E because it's not in the word.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that has:
 - S at index 3
 - and no letters from R,A,I,E.

 And the fifth letter cannot be E? So we can't use words ending in ES? 

 What are words with S at position 3? Also, without R,A,I,E.

 Let me try:

 ""JOUST"": J-O-U-S-T -> 
 J(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), T(4) -> so index 3 is S? Actually: 
 In ""JOUST"", the letters are: 
 Position 0: J
 Position 1: O
 Position 2: U
 Position 3: S? 
 Wait, no: J-O-U-S-T? That would be 5 letters: J-O-U-S-T -> positions: 
 0:J, 1:O, 2:U, 3:S, 4:T? So index 3 is S? Yes! And T at the end? 

 This word doesn’t contain R,A,I,E? Let's check: J,O,U,S,T -> none of R,A,I,E. 

 Also, ""joust"" is a valid English word (meaning to engage in combat).

 Alternatively, other words? 
 ""DOUTS"" -> D-O-U-T-S? but then index 3 is T? S is at the end.
 ""GUSTO"": G-U-S-T-O? Then index 0:G, 1:U, 2:S -> so we have S at index 2? But we need index 3? Then not.
 ""BUSTY"": B-U-S-T-Y -> index 0:B, 1:U, 2:S -> again index 2? Not index 3.

 Actually, for S at index 3, the words are much less common? 

 Another idea: ""FUSSY"" that I thought earlier? F-U-S-S-Y? 
 Index 0:F, 1:U, 2:S, 3:S, 4:Y -> so index 3 is S? It has two S? That's okay? 

 And the word ""fussy""? Valid English word? Meaning overly concerned?

 So let's see: 
 ""fussy"" has F, U, S, S, Y -> and no R,A,I,E? Correct? So that's an option.

 However, note that we already know that the secret word has an S? And if we guess a word with two S, then we can figure out if there is a second S? Because if the secret word has two S, then both could be marked? 

 But what if the secret word has only one S? Then in ""fussy"", the first S (index 2) would be marked as absent (because there is already one S accounted for at index 3) and the S at index 3 would be ✓? But let me simulate:

 Suppose secret word is ""JOUST"" (which has one S). Guess ""fussy"":
 Position 0: F? not in JOUST -> x
 Position 1: U? JOUST has U? But at position 2? So wrong position? so mark for U: - (wrong position) 
 Position 2: S? But secret word has only one S and it's at position 3? So there is no S at position 2? And we already account for the S? So should be x? 
 Position 3: S? Correct? ✓
 Position 4: Y? JOUST ends with T? So Y not present? -> x

 But according to Wordle rules: since the secret word has one S and it is at position 3, the guess has two S: one at position 2 (which is not present) and one at position 3 (correct). So the S at position 2 would be marked as absent? So F(x), U(-), S(x), S(✓), Y(x) -> FUSSY would show F:x U:? S:x S:✓ Y:x? But note: the first S (at index 2) is marked x because the secret word's S is already accounted for by the position 3? So no extra S.

 However, if the secret word had two S? Then both would be marked. But we don't know.

 So guessing a word with two S might be beneficial? Because we can determine the count.

 But note: our goal is to find the secret word quickly. We only have 6 tries.

 Alternatively, we can guess a word with only the known S and new letters? To maximize letter testing.

 Since we haven't tested many letters: 

 Known absent: R, A, I, E.
 Known present: S (at index 3).

 We need to test O, U, Y? Or consonants? 

 But let me consider: we have to choose a word with S at index 3? So what's better? ""JOUST"" or ""FUSSY""? 

 Both are valid. 

 ""JOUST"" includes J, O, U, S, T -> S at index 3? Actually, wait: 
 J-O-U-S? That's 4 letters? Then T? So J-O-U-S-T: 
 position 0: J -> uncommon?
 position 1: O
 position 2: U
 position 3: S? Actually, the word ""JOUST"" is spelled J-O-U-S-T? I think yes? 

 Actually, in some dictionaries, ""joust"" is acceptable? We can use it.

 Alternatively, ""COSTS"" -> but then we have C-O-S-T-S? 
 position 0: C, 1:O, 2:S -> then position 3:T -> that's not S? So invalid? 

 Another word: ""MUSTY"": M-U-S-T-Y -> 
 M(0), U(1), S(2), T(3), Y(4) -> then S is at index 2? Not index 3.

 ""BUSKS"": B-U-S-K-S -> 
 B(0), U(1), S(2), K(3), S(4) -> index 3 is K? not S.

 So word with S at index 3? Actually, let me list:

 - ""BOUSY"" -> not common.
 - ""CLOUTS"" -> that's 6 letters? wait, 5: C-L-O-U-T-S? -> position 3 would be U? no, indexing: 
   C at 0, L at 1, O at 2, U at 3, T at 4 -> then the last letter? Wait, 5 letters: CLOUT (if no S) -> but ""CLOUTS"" is 6? 

 I found: ""BOOSTS"" -> 6 letters? 

 Actually, ""FUSSY"" is good: F-U-S-S-Y -> it has two S? So index 3 is the second S? But still index 3 is S? Yes? 

 Alternatively, ""MANUS"" -> M-A-N-U-S? But A is forbidden? 

 Another: ""FOCUS"" -> F-O-C-U-S -> index 3 is U? not S? Because F(0), O(1), C(2), U(3), S(4) -> so index 3 is U and index 4 is S? 

 But we need index 3 to be S? 

 How about ""FRASS"" -> F-R-A-S-S? But R and A forbidden? 

 So ""YOUTH"" doesn't have S? 

 I think ""JOUST"" is acceptable? Or ""TOUSY""? ""TOUSY"" is an adjective meaning disorderly? T-O-U-S-Y? 
 T(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), Y(4)? 

 Yes! And it doesn't have R,A,I,E? If we believe that ""tousy"" is a valid word? It might be in some dictionaries? But let's try a more common one.

 Alternatively, ""LOUSY"": L-O-U-S-Y? 
 L(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), Y(4) -> yes! 
 And L, O, U, S, Y -> no R,A,I,E? 
 The word ""lousy"" means extremely disgusting? But commonly used? 

 So I choose ""LOUSY"" because it's more common? 

 But note: we are using S at the position we need? And we get to test L, O, U, Y? 

 So let's plan:

 We guess ""LOUSY"": L-O-U-S-Y

 What happens if the secret word has O, U, Y? And S? 

 But also, if the secret word is ""JOUST"", then with ""LOUSY"":
 L: absent? because JOUST: J,O,U,S,T -> L is absent? Then L(x), O(✓) because at position 1? Actually, JOUST has O at position 1? So same? 
 Position 0: L? not in JOUST? -> x
 Position 1: O? in JOUST at the same position? -> ✓
 Position 2: U? in JOUST at the same position? -> ✓? Actually, JOUST: O at index1, U at index2? So in LO-USY: L,O,U,S,Y? So O at index1? Correct? U at index2? Correct? Then S at index3? Correct? Y at index4? But JOUST ends with T? So Y absent? 

 So feedback for LOUSY against JOUST: L(x) O(✓) U(✓) S(✓) Y(x)? 

 But if the secret word is ""FUSSY"", then:
 Position 0: L? vs FUSSY: F? -> L absent? -> x
 Position 1: O? FUSSY: U at index1? So no O? -> x? 
 Position 2: U? FUSSY has U at index1? So at index2? wrong? Then mark U as present but wrong position? -> -
 Position 3: S? Correct? ✓
 Position 4: Y? FUSSY ends in Y? So correct? ✓

 So we can distinguish? 

 But regardless, we are gathering information.

 We also have other words? 

 Another word: ""MUSSY"": meaning messy? M-U-S-S-Y? 
 M(0), U(1), S(2), S(3), Y(4)? 
 Then S is at index3? So M-U-S-S-Y? Then index3 is S? And no R,A,I,E.

 That's also valid? 

 However, I think ""LOUSY"" is fine? Or even ""TOUSY""? 

 Let me choose ""LOUSY"" because it has two vowels? 

 Also, note: the consonants we haven't tested: T, N, D, etc.

 Alternatively, ""YOUNG"" has no S? 

 Since we must fix S at position 3? We don't have much choice? 

 So I'll go with ""lousy"".

 But wait: let's check: ""lousy"" has S at position 3? Yes: L O U S Y -> positions: 
 0:L
 1:O
 2:U
 3:S 
 4:Y

 So yes.

 Therefore, I choose ""LOUSY"".

 Response: <guess>lousy</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":  
- **R, A, I, E** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").  
- **S** is **present and in the correct position** (marked ""✓"" at index 3, the 4th letter).  

### Key Constraints for Next Guess:  
1. The word must have **S at position 3 (index 3)**.  
2. The word **cannot contain R, A, I, or E**.  
3. New letters should be tested to reveal more about the secret word, prioritizing common vowels (like O, U) and consonants.  

### Selected Guess: ""LOUSY""  
- **Why?**  
  - Satisfies S at index 3: `L O U S Y` → `? ? ? ? ?` → `S` is in position 3.  
  - Uses **L, O, U, Y** → Tests two vowels (O, U) and two consonants (L, Y), all new and not excluded.  
  - ""LOUSY"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning inferior or unsatisfactory).  
  - Maximizes letter coverage: Since R, A, I, E are out, this guess efficiently probes other common letters to narrow down possibilities.  

<guess>lousy</guess>",lousy,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
 R(x) -> R is not in the word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the word.
 I(x) -> I is not in the word.
 S(✓) -> S is in the word and in the correct position? Wait, the symbol is '✓' meaning correct position? But in the example, ✓ means correct position.

 However, looking back at the rules: ✓ means the letter is in the word and in the correct position.

 But note: in the feedback for ""raise"", we have S(✓) meaning that S is in the secret word and it is at the same position as in ""raise"", that is, the fourth position (index 3, counting from 0?).

 Also, note that R, A, I, E are all absent.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The letter S is present and is the fourth letter of the secret word (so the word ends with ...S? Actually, no, it's the fourth letter, meaning position 3?).

 But note: the word is 5 letters. So positions: 0,1,2,3,4.
 Since ""raise"" was R-A-I-S-E, the S is at position 3.

 Therefore, the secret word has S as its fourth letter (position 3).

 And R, A, I, E are absent.

 So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, E. Also, it does contain S at position 3.

 Since E is absent, common vowels A, E, I are out. So the secret word must have other vowels? Or it might not? English words must have vowels, so likely vowels: O, U, sometimes Y (if allowed, but typically Wordle uses common words so Y might be allowed).

 However, we are not told that Y is always allowed? But the rules say ""valid 5-letter English word"". So let's consider O, U, and Y (if it's a vowel).

 Now, for the next guess:
 - We must have a word that has S at position 3 (index 3) because we know S is fixed at that position? But note: we don't know the positions of other letters, but S can't be moved? Actually, we can try words that have S at position 3 to get more feedback.

 However, we also know that the word cannot contain R, A, I, E.

 So, when constructing the next word:
 - Must be a 5-letter English word.
 - Must have S at the 4th position (index 3).
 - Must not use R, A, I, E.

 What letters are left? Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Note O and U are vowels.

 Since we don't have many vowels left, we might want to include O or U to see if they are in the word.

 Also, note that S is the only letter we know so far.

 Let's think of words that satisfy:
 - Position 3 (the fourth character) must be S.
 - The other letters: no R, A, I, E.

 Some options:

 Option 1: Try words with O and U? Or common consonants?

 Example: ""FOCUS"" -> F at 0, O at 1, C at 2, U at 4? But wait, position 3 must be S? So ""FOCUS"" doesn't have S at position 3? It ends with U-S? Actually, ""FOCUS"" has letters: 
 0: F, 1: O, 2: C, 3: U, 4: S -> but wait, we need the fourth letter (position 3) to be S? In ""FOCUS"", position 3 is U and position 4 is S? That doesn't match.

 Actually, we need S at position 3 (which is the fourth position in a 5-letter string, since indexing starts at 0: positions 0,1,2,3,4). So S must be at index 3.

 Example: ""HOSTS"" -> but has duplicate S? And S at index 3? Let's break down: 
 H-O-S-T-S? Positions: 0:H, 1:O, 2:S, 3:T, 4:S -> No, the S at index 3 would be T? Actually, no: the word is 5 letters: ""HOSTS"" -> 
 H (0), O (1), S (2), T (3), S (4) -> So index 3 is T? Then not S at index 3.

 We need a word where the character at index 3 is S.

 Examples of words that end with ...S? But note: index 3 is the fourth letter, so the fifth letter can be anything? Actually, the word could be like X X X S X.

 For instance: ""BONUS"" -> B (0), O (1), N (2), U (3), S (4) -> index 3 is U? So that's not S.

 How about ""DENTS"" -> D (0), E (1), N (2), T (3), S (4) -> index 3 is T? No.

 Or ""LANTS"" -> L-A-N-T-S? That's not a common word.

 Actually, let me think: words with the fourth letter S? That would be words ending in 'S'? Not necessarily, because position 3 is the fourth character? For example: ""CRASS"" -> C-R-A-S-S? Then: 
 Index 0: C
 Index 1: R -> but R is forbidden? We know R is absent.

 Since R is absent, we can't use R.

 Another example: ""COSTS"" -> C-O-S-T-S? That's C at index 0, O at 1, S at 2, T at 3, S at 4. So index 3 is T? Then not S.

 How about ""JUMPS"" -> J-U-M-P-S: 
 J(0), U(1), M(2), P(3), S(4) -> index 3 P? Not S.

 Actually, we need the letter at index 3 to be S. So the word must end with 'S'? Only if index 3 is the fourth character and index 4 is fifth, so the word pattern is _ _ _ S _

 But wait: the word ends at index 4? So it's not necessarily the last letter? Example: ""CHAOS"" -> C-H-A-O-S: 
 index 0: C, 1: H, 2: A -> forbidden (A absent), 3: O, 4: S? So index 3 is O.

 How about ""FUSSY"": F-U-S-S-Y -> 
 F(0), U(1), S(2), S(3), Y(4) -> This has S at index 3? Yes!

 However, we also have S at index 2? That's duplicate S? But we don't know how many S the secret word has. Our feedback only said one S at index 3? Actually, in the first guess, we only had one S and it was correct. But the word could have more S? However, our feedback didn't show any other S? But our guess only had one S.

 Actually, the word ""raise"" only had one S. So the feedback for S was correct at index 3? That doesn't say about duplicate S? Wait: if the secret word had another S at another position? Then in the first guess we didn't guess an S at that position? So it wouldn't show up? This is tricky.

 According to the rules: the feedback for each letter is independent? Actually, no: I recall in Wordle, if there is a duplicate letter, it can be marked only if it appears that many times? But let me recall the exact rule:

 Typically: 
 - If a letter is in the word and in the correct position, it gets ✓.
 - If a letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets -.
 - But if a letter appears more times in the guess than in the secret word, then the excess will be marked as x.

 However, in our feedback for ""raise"", we have R(x), A(x), I(x), S(✓), E(x). Since we didn't have any other S, we cannot be sure if there are multiple S? So it's possible.

 But here, since we know S is at index 3, we must choose a word that has S at index 3? And we are free to choose other letters? We should avoid R, A, I, E.

 So for next guess, we want:
 - A word that has S at position 3 (index 3).
 - Does not contain R, A, I, E.
 - And we want to test other common letters? Like consonants? Or vowels O, U, Y.

 So let me think of words that fit: pattern _ _ _ S _ (where the fifth character can be anything).

 For example:
 - ""PULPS"": P-U-L-P-S -> index 3 is P? no, index 3 would be the fourth letter: so letters 0:P, 1:U, 2:L, 3:P, 4:S -> index 3 is P? Not S.

 Correction: the pattern must have the fourth letter (index 3) be S.

 How about:
 ""TONUS"" -> T-O-N-U-S? But then index 3 is U? not S.

 ""MOUSE"": M-O-U-S-E -> 
 M(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), E(4) -> Ah! index 3 is S? Yes. But wait: E is absent? We know E is absent? So we can't have E at the end? Because feedback told us E is not in the word? So ""MOUSE"" has E? So it's invalid because we know E is absent? And also we don't want to use E because it's not in the word.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that has:
 - S at index 3
 - and no letters from R,A,I,E.

 And the fifth letter cannot be E? So we can't use words ending in ES? 

 What are words with S at position 3? Also, without R,A,I,E.

 Let me try:

 ""JOUST"": J-O-U-S-T -> 
 J(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), T(4) -> so index 3 is S? Actually: 
 In ""JOUST"", the letters are: 
 Position 0: J
 Position 1: O
 Position 2: U
 Position 3: S? 
 Wait, no: J-O-U-S-T? That would be 5 letters: J-O-U-S-T -> positions: 
 0:J, 1:O, 2:U, 3:S, 4:T? So index 3 is S? Yes! And T at the end? 

 This word doesn’t contain R,A,I,E? Let's check: J,O,U,S,T -> none of R,A,I,E. 

 Also, ""joust"" is a valid English word (meaning to engage in combat).

 Alternatively, other words? 
 ""DOUTS"" -> D-O-U-T-S? but then index 3 is T? S is at the end.
 ""GUSTO"": G-U-S-T-O? Then index 0:G, 1:U, 2:S -> so we have S at index 2? But we need index 3? Then not.
 ""BUSTY"": B-U-S-T-Y -> index 0:B, 1:U, 2:S -> again index 2? Not index 3.

 Actually, for S at index 3, the words are much less common? 

 Another idea: ""FUSSY"" that I thought earlier? F-U-S-S-Y? 
 Index 0:F, 1:U, 2:S, 3:S, 4:Y -> so index 3 is S? It has two S? That's okay? 

 And the word ""fussy""? Valid English word? Meaning overly concerned?

 So let's see: 
 ""fussy"" has F, U, S, S, Y -> and no R,A,I,E? Correct? So that's an option.

 However, note that we already know that the secret word has an S? And if we guess a word with two S, then we can figure out if there is a second S? Because if the secret word has two S, then both could be marked? 

 But what if the secret word has only one S? Then in ""fussy"", the first S (index 2) would be marked as absent (because there is already one S accounted for at index 3) and the S at index 3 would be ✓? But let me simulate:

 Suppose secret word is ""JOUST"" (which has one S). Guess ""fussy"":
 Position 0: F? not in JOUST -> x
 Position 1: U? JOUST has U? But at position 2? So wrong position? so mark for U: - (wrong position) 
 Position 2: S? But secret word has only one S and it's at position 3? So there is no S at position 2? And we already account for the S? So should be x? 
 Position 3: S? Correct? ✓
 Position 4: Y? JOUST ends with T? So Y not present? -> x

 But according to Wordle rules: since the secret word has one S and it is at position 3, the guess has two S: one at position 2 (which is not present) and one at position 3 (correct). So the S at position 2 would be marked as absent? So F(x), U(-), S(x), S(✓), Y(x) -> FUSSY would show F:x U:? S:x S:✓ Y:x? But note: the first S (at index 2) is marked x because the secret word's S is already accounted for by the position 3? So no extra S.

 However, if the secret word had two S? Then both would be marked. But we don't know.

 So guessing a word with two S might be beneficial? Because we can determine the count.

 But note: our goal is to find the secret word quickly. We only have 6 tries.

 Alternatively, we can guess a word with only the known S and new letters? To maximize letter testing.

 Since we haven't tested many letters: 

 Known absent: R, A, I, E.
 Known present: S (at index 3).

 We need to test O, U, Y? Or consonants? 

 But let me consider: we have to choose a word with S at index 3? So what's better? ""JOUST"" or ""FUSSY""? 

 Both are valid. 

 ""JOUST"" includes J, O, U, S, T -> S at index 3? Actually, wait: 
 J-O-U-S? That's 4 letters? Then T? So J-O-U-S-T: 
 position 0: J -> uncommon?
 position 1: O
 position 2: U
 position 3: S? Actually, the word ""JOUST"" is spelled J-O-U-S-T? I think yes? 

 Actually, in some dictionaries, ""joust"" is acceptable? We can use it.

 Alternatively, ""COSTS"" -> but then we have C-O-S-T-S? 
 position 0: C, 1:O, 2:S -> then position 3:T -> that's not S? So invalid? 

 Another word: ""MUSTY"": M-U-S-T-Y -> 
 M(0), U(1), S(2), T(3), Y(4) -> then S is at index 2? Not index 3.

 ""BUSKS"": B-U-S-K-S -> 
 B(0), U(1), S(2), K(3), S(4) -> index 3 is K? not S.

 So word with S at index 3? Actually, let me list:

 - ""BOUSY"" -> not common.
 - ""CLOUTS"" -> that's 6 letters? wait, 5: C-L-O-U-T-S? -> position 3 would be U? no, indexing: 
   C at 0, L at 1, O at 2, U at 3, T at 4 -> then the last letter? Wait, 5 letters: CLOUT (if no S) -> but ""CLOUTS"" is 6? 

 I found: ""BOOSTS"" -> 6 letters? 

 Actually, ""FUSSY"" is good: F-U-S-S-Y -> it has two S? So index 3 is the second S? But still index 3 is S? Yes? 

 Alternatively, ""MANUS"" -> M-A-N-U-S? But A is forbidden? 

 Another: ""FOCUS"" -> F-O-C-U-S -> index 3 is U? not S? Because F(0), O(1), C(2), U(3), S(4) -> so index 3 is U and index 4 is S? 

 But we need index 3 to be S? 

 How about ""FRASS"" -> F-R-A-S-S? But R and A forbidden? 

 So ""YOUTH"" doesn't have S? 

 I think ""JOUST"" is acceptable? Or ""TOUSY""? ""TOUSY"" is an adjective meaning disorderly? T-O-U-S-Y? 
 T(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), Y(4)? 

 Yes! And it doesn't have R,A,I,E? If we believe that ""tousy"" is a valid word? It might be in some dictionaries? But let's try a more common one.

 Alternatively, ""LOUSY"": L-O-U-S-Y? 
 L(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), Y(4) -> yes! 
 And L, O, U, S, Y -> no R,A,I,E? 
 The word ""lousy"" means extremely disgusting? But commonly used? 

 So I choose ""LOUSY"" because it's more common? 

 But note: we are using S at the position we need? And we get to test L, O, U, Y? 

 So let's plan:

 We guess ""LOUSY"": L-O-U-S-Y

 What happens if the secret word has O, U, Y? And S? 

 But also, if the secret word is ""JOUST"", then with ""LOUSY"":
 L: absent? because JOUST: J,O,U,S,T -> L is absent? Then L(x), O(✓) because at position 1? Actually, JOUST has O at position 1? So same? 
 Position 0: L? not in JOUST? -> x
 Position 1: O? in JOUST at the same position? -> ✓
 Position 2: U? in JOUST at the same position? -> ✓? Actually, JOUST: O at index1, U at index2? So in LO-USY: L,O,U,S,Y? So O at index1? Correct? U at index2? Correct? Then S at index3? Correct? Y at index4? But JOUST ends with T? So Y absent? 

 So feedback for LOUSY against JOUST: L(x) O(✓) U(✓) S(✓) Y(x)? 

 But if the secret word is ""FUSSY"", then:
 Position 0: L? vs FUSSY: F? -> L absent? -> x
 Position 1: O? FUSSY: U at index1? So no O? -> x? 
 Position 2: U? FUSSY has U at index1? So at index2? wrong? Then mark U as present but wrong position? -> -
 Position 3: S? Correct? ✓
 Position 4: Y? FUSSY ends in Y? So correct? ✓

 So we can distinguish? 

 But regardless, we are gathering information.

 We also have other words? 

 Another word: ""MUSSY"": meaning messy? M-U-S-S-Y? 
 M(0), U(1), S(2), S(3), Y(4)? 
 Then S is at index3? So M-U-S-S-Y? Then index3 is S? And no R,A,I,E.

 That's also valid? 

 However, I think ""LOUSY"" is fine? Or even ""TOUSY""? 

 Let me choose ""LOUSY"" because it has two vowels? 

 Also, note: the consonants we haven't tested: T, N, D, etc.

 Alternatively, ""YOUNG"" has no S? 

 Since we must fix S at position 3? We don't have much choice? 

 So I'll go with ""lousy"".

 But wait: let's check: ""lousy"" has S at position 3? Yes: L O U S Y -> positions: 
 0:L
 1:O
 2:U
 3:S 
 4:Y

 So yes.

 Therefore, I choose ""LOUSY"".

 Since I have no information, I want a word that has common letters to maximize feedback.
 A good starting word often uses common letters like vowels (A,E,I,O,U) and common consonants (R,S,T,L,N).
 Also, avoiding repeating letters might help get more information.

 Let me think of a word that includes several common letters. 
 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has C,R,A,N,E. But let's check alternatives.

 Another common one is ""SLATE"" which has S,L,A,T,E. 

 However, let's try to cover more different letters. I recall that ""ROATE"" or ""SOARE"" are sometimes used but they are less common.

 But note: the rules don't specify that the word must be common, but it must be valid.

 However, since the feedback uses 5 letters and we are trying to maximize information, let me consider:

 - Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now)
 - Consonants: R, S, T, L, N are very common.

 A word that covers many of these is ""RAISE"" -> R, A, I, S, E. It has three vowels (A,I,E) and two common consonants (R,S).

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" has C,R,A,N,E: two vowels (A,E) and three consonants.

 Perhaps ""RAISE"" is a little better because it has three vowels? But note that the position of vowels might matter.

 After checking, ""RAISE"" is a valid English word (meaning to lift up).

 Therefore, I will choose ""RAISE"" as the first guess.

 Response format: 
 <guess> raise </guess>I need to make an effective first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and vowels. 

- **Common letters**: English words frequently use vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.  
- **Strategy**: Prioritize a word with **3 vowels and 2 common consonants** to increase chances of hitting letters in the secret word.  
- **Choice**: ""RAISE"" is ideal—it contains **R, A, I, S, E**. This covers:  
  - 3 vowels (A, I, E)  
  - 2 high-frequency consonants (R, S)

This guess will help reveal which letters exist and their positions, setting a strong foundation for subsequent guesses.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
 R(x) -> R is not in the word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the word.
 I(x) -> I is not in the word.
 S(✓) -> S is in the word and in the correct position? Wait, the symbol is '✓' meaning correct position? But in the example, ✓ means correct position.

 However, looking back at the rules: ✓ means the letter is in the word and in the correct position.

 But note: in the feedback for ""raise"", we have S(✓) meaning that S is in the secret word and it is at the same position as in ""raise"", that is, the fourth position (index 3, counting from 0?).

 Also, note that R, A, I, E are all absent.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The letter S is present and is the fourth letter of the secret word (so the word ends with ...S? Actually, no, it's the fourth letter, meaning position 3?).

 But note: the word is 5 letters. So positions: 0,1,2,3,4.
 Since ""raise"" was R-A-I-S-E, the S is at position 3.

 Therefore, the secret word has S as its fourth letter (position 3).

 And R, A, I, E are absent.

 So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, E. Also, it does contain S at position 3.

 Since E is absent, common vowels A, E, I are out. So the secret word must have other vowels? Or it might not? English words must have vowels, so likely vowels: O, U, sometimes Y (if allowed, but typically Wordle uses common words so Y might be allowed).

 However, we are not told that Y is always allowed? But the rules say ""valid 5-letter English word"". So let's consider O, U, and Y (if it's a vowel).

 Now, for the next guess:
 - We must have a word that has S at position 3 (index 3) because we know S is fixed at that position? But note: we don't know the positions of other letters, but S can't be moved? Actually, we can try words that have S at position 3 to get more feedback.

 However, we also know that the word cannot contain R, A, I, E.

 So, when constructing the next word:
 - Must be a 5-letter English word.
 - Must have S at the 4th position (index 3).
 - Must not use R, A, I, E.

 What letters are left? Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Note O and U are vowels.

 Since we don't have many vowels left, we might want to include O or U to see if they are in the word.

 Also, note that S is the only letter we know so far.

 Let's think of words that satisfy:
 - Position 3 (the fourth character) must be S.
 - The other letters: no R, A, I, E.

 Some options:

 Option 1: Try words with O and U? Or common consonants?

 Example: ""FOCUS"" -> F at 0, O at 1, C at 2, U at 4? But wait, position 3 must be S? So ""FOCUS"" doesn't have S at position 3? It ends with U-S? Actually, ""FOCUS"" has letters: 
 0: F, 1: O, 2: C, 3: U, 4: S -> but wait, we need the fourth letter (position 3) to be S? In ""FOCUS"", position 3 is U and position 4 is S? That doesn't match.

 Actually, we need S at position 3 (which is the fourth position in a 5-letter string, since indexing starts at 0: positions 0,1,2,3,4). So S must be at index 3.

 Example: ""HOSTS"" -> but has duplicate S? And S at index 3? Let's break down: 
 H-O-S-T-S? Positions: 0:H, 1:O, 2:S, 3:T, 4:S -> No, the S at index 3 would be T? Actually, no: the word is 5 letters: ""HOSTS"" -> 
 H (0), O (1), S (2), T (3), S (4) -> So index 3 is T? Then not S at index 3.

 We need a word where the character at index 3 is S.

 Examples of words that end with ...S? But note: index 3 is the fourth letter, so the fifth letter can be anything? Actually, the word could be like X X X S X.

 For instance: ""BONUS"" -> B (0), O (1), N (2), U (3), S (4) -> index 3 is U? So that's not S.

 How about ""DENTS"" -> D (0), E (1), N (2), T (3), S (4) -> index 3 is T? No.

 Or ""LANTS"" -> L-A-N-T-S? That's not a common word.

 Actually, let me think: words with the fourth letter S? That would be words ending in 'S'? Not necessarily, because position 3 is the fourth character? For example: ""CRASS"" -> C-R-A-S-S? Then: 
 Index 0: C
 Index 1: R -> but R is forbidden? We know R is absent.

 Since R is absent, we can't use R.

 Another example: ""COSTS"" -> C-O-S-T-S? That's C at index 0, O at 1, S at 2, T at 3, S at 4. So index 3 is T? Then not S.

 How about ""JUMPS"" -> J-U-M-P-S: 
 J(0), U(1), M(2), P(3), S(4) -> index 3 P? Not S.

 Actually, we need the letter at index 3 to be S. So the word must end with 'S'? Only if index 3 is the fourth character and index 4 is fifth, so the word pattern is _ _ _ S _

 But wait: the word ends at index 4? So it's not necessarily the last letter? Example: ""CHAOS"" -> C-H-A-O-S: 
 index 0: C, 1: H, 2: A -> forbidden (A absent), 3: O, 4: S? So index 3 is O.

 How about ""FUSSY"": F-U-S-S-Y -> 
 F(0), U(1), S(2), S(3), Y(4) -> This has S at index 3? Yes!

 However, we also have S at index 2? That's duplicate S? But we don't know how many S the secret word has. Our feedback only said one S at index 3? Actually, in the first guess, we only had one S and it was correct. But the word could have more S? However, our feedback didn't show any other S? But our guess only had one S.

 Actually, the word ""raise"" only had one S. So the feedback for S was correct at index 3? That doesn't say about duplicate S? Wait: if the secret word had another S at another position? Then in the first guess we didn't guess an S at that position? So it wouldn't show up? This is tricky.

 According to the rules: the feedback for each letter is independent? Actually, no: I recall in Wordle, if there is a duplicate letter, it can be marked only if it appears that many times? But let me recall the exact rule:

 Typically: 
 - If a letter is in the word and in the correct position, it gets ✓.
 - If a letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets -.
 - But if a letter appears more times in the guess than in the secret word, then the excess will be marked as x.

 However, in our feedback for ""raise"", we have R(x), A(x), I(x), S(✓), E(x). Since we didn't have any other S, we cannot be sure if there are multiple S? So it's possible.

 But here, since we know S is at index 3, we must choose a word that has S at index 3? And we are free to choose other letters? We should avoid R, A, I, E.

 So for next guess, we want:
 - A word that has S at position 3 (index 3).
 - Does not contain R, A, I, E.
 - And we want to test other common letters? Like consonants? Or vowels O, U, Y.

 So let me think of words that fit: pattern _ _ _ S _ (where the fifth character can be anything).

 For example:
 - ""PULPS"": P-U-L-P-S -> index 3 is P? no, index 3 would be the fourth letter: so letters 0:P, 1:U, 2:L, 3:P, 4:S -> index 3 is P? Not S.

 Correction: the pattern must have the fourth letter (index 3) be S.

 How about:
 ""TONUS"" -> T-O-N-U-S? But then index 3 is U? not S.

 ""MOUSE"": M-O-U-S-E -> 
 M(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), E(4) -> Ah! index 3 is S? Yes. But wait: E is absent? We know E is absent? So we can't have E at the end? Because feedback told us E is not in the word? So ""MOUSE"" has E? So it's invalid because we know E is absent? And also we don't want to use E because it's not in the word.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that has:
 - S at index 3
 - and no letters from R,A,I,E.

 And the fifth letter cannot be E? So we can't use words ending in ES? 

 What are words with S at position 3? Also, without R,A,I,E.

 Let me try:

 ""JOUST"": J-O-U-S-T -> 
 J(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), T(4) -> so index 3 is S? Actually: 
 In ""JOUST"", the letters are: 
 Position 0: J
 Position 1: O
 Position 2: U
 Position 3: S? 
 Wait, no: J-O-U-S-T? That would be 5 letters: J-O-U-S-T -> positions: 
 0:J, 1:O, 2:U, 3:S, 4:T? So index 3 is S? Yes! And T at the end? 

 This word doesn’t contain R,A,I,E? Let's check: J,O,U,S,T -> none of R,A,I,E. 

 Also, ""joust"" is a valid English word (meaning to engage in combat).

 Alternatively, other words? 
 ""DOUTS"" -> D-O-U-T-S? but then index 3 is T? S is at the end.
 ""GUSTO"": G-U-S-T-O? Then index 0:G, 1:U, 2:S -> so we have S at index 2? But we need index 3? Then not.
 ""BUSTY"": B-U-S-T-Y -> index 0:B, 1:U, 2:S -> again index 2? Not index 3.

 Actually, for S at index 3, the words are much less common? 

 Another idea: ""FUSSY"" that I thought earlier? F-U-S-S-Y? 
 Index 0:F, 1:U, 2:S, 3:S, 4:Y -> so index 3 is S? It has two S? That's okay? 

 And the word ""fussy""? Valid English word? Meaning overly concerned?

 So let's see: 
 ""fussy"" has F, U, S, S, Y -> and no R,A,I,E? Correct? So that's an option.

 However, note that we already know that the secret word has an S? And if we guess a word with two S, then we can figure out if there is a second S? Because if the secret word has two S, then both could be marked? 

 But what if the secret word has only one S? Then in ""fussy"", the first S (index 2) would be marked as absent (because there is already one S accounted for at index 3) and the S at index 3 would be ✓? But let me simulate:

 Suppose secret word is ""JOUST"" (which has one S). Guess ""fussy"":
 Position 0: F? not in JOUST -> x
 Position 1: U? JOUST has U? But at position 2? So wrong position? so mark for U: - (wrong position) 
 Position 2: S? But secret word has only one S and it's at position 3? So there is no S at position 2? And we already account for the S? So should be x? 
 Position 3: S? Correct? ✓
 Position 4: Y? JOUST ends with T? So Y not present? -> x

 But according to Wordle rules: since the secret word has one S and it is at position 3, the guess has two S: one at position 2 (which is not present) and one at position 3 (correct). So the S at position 2 would be marked as absent? So F(x), U(-), S(x), S(✓), Y(x) -> FUSSY would show F:x U:? S:x S:✓ Y:x? But note: the first S (at index 2) is marked x because the secret word's S is already accounted for by the position 3? So no extra S.

 However, if the secret word had two S? Then both would be marked. But we don't know.

 So guessing a word with two S might be beneficial? Because we can determine the count.

 But note: our goal is to find the secret word quickly. We only have 6 tries.

 Alternatively, we can guess a word with only the known S and new letters? To maximize letter testing.

 Since we haven't tested many letters: 

 Known absent: R, A, I, E.
 Known present: S (at index 3).

 We need to test O, U, Y? Or consonants? 

 But let me consider: we have to choose a word with S at index 3? So what's better? ""JOUST"" or ""FUSSY""? 

 Both are valid. 

 ""JOUST"" includes J, O, U, S, T -> S at index 3? Actually, wait: 
 J-O-U-S? That's 4 letters? Then T? So J-O-U-S-T: 
 position 0: J -> uncommon?
 position 1: O
 position 2: U
 position 3: S? Actually, the word ""JOUST"" is spelled J-O-U-S-T? I think yes? 

 Actually, in some dictionaries, ""joust"" is acceptable? We can use it.

 Alternatively, ""COSTS"" -> but then we have C-O-S-T-S? 
 position 0: C, 1:O, 2:S -> then position 3:T -> that's not S? So invalid? 

 Another word: ""MUSTY"": M-U-S-T-Y -> 
 M(0), U(1), S(2), T(3), Y(4) -> then S is at index 2? Not index 3.

 ""BUSKS"": B-U-S-K-S -> 
 B(0), U(1), S(2), K(3), S(4) -> index 3 is K? not S.

 So word with S at index 3? Actually, let me list:

 - ""BOUSY"" -> not common.
 - ""CLOUTS"" -> that's 6 letters? wait, 5: C-L-O-U-T-S? -> position 3 would be U? no, indexing: 
   C at 0, L at 1, O at 2, U at 3, T at 4 -> then the last letter? Wait, 5 letters: CLOUT (if no S) -> but ""CLOUTS"" is 6? 

 I found: ""BOOSTS"" -> 6 letters? 

 Actually, ""FUSSY"" is good: F-U-S-S-Y -> it has two S? So index 3 is the second S? But still index 3 is S? Yes? 

 Alternatively, ""MANUS"" -> M-A-N-U-S? But A is forbidden? 

 Another: ""FOCUS"" -> F-O-C-U-S -> index 3 is U? not S? Because F(0), O(1), C(2), U(3), S(4) -> so index 3 is U and index 4 is S? 

 But we need index 3 to be S? 

 How about ""FRASS"" -> F-R-A-S-S? But R and A forbidden? 

 So ""YOUTH"" doesn't have S? 

 I think ""JOUST"" is acceptable? Or ""TOUSY""? ""TOUSY"" is an adjective meaning disorderly? T-O-U-S-Y? 
 T(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), Y(4)? 

 Yes! And it doesn't have R,A,I,E? If we believe that ""tousy"" is a valid word? It might be in some dictionaries? But let's try a more common one.

 Alternatively, ""LOUSY"": L-O-U-S-Y? 
 L(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), Y(4) -> yes! 
 And L, O, U, S, Y -> no R,A,I,E? 
 The word ""lousy"" means extremely disgusting? But commonly used? 

 So I choose ""LOUSY"" because it's more common? 

 But note: we are using S at the position we need? And we get to test L, O, U, Y? 

 So let's plan:

 We guess ""LOUSY"": L-O-U-S-Y

 What happens if the secret word has O, U, Y? And S? 

 But also, if the secret word is ""JOUST"", then with ""LOUSY"":
 L: absent? because JOUST: J,O,U,S,T -> L is absent? Then L(x), O(✓) because at position 1? Actually, JOUST has O at position 1? So same? 
 Position 0: L? not in JOUST? -> x
 Position 1: O? in JOUST at the same position? -> ✓
 Position 2: U? in JOUST at the same position? -> ✓? Actually, JOUST: O at index1, U at index2? So in LO-USY: L,O,U,S,Y? So O at index1? Correct? U at index2? Correct? Then S at index3? Correct? Y at index4? But JOUST ends with T? So Y absent? 

 So feedback for LOUSY against JOUST: L(x) O(✓) U(✓) S(✓) Y(x)? 

 But if the secret word is ""FUSSY"", then:
 Position 0: L? vs FUSSY: F? -> L absent? -> x
 Position 1: O? FUSSY: U at index1? So no O? -> x? 
 Position 2: U? FUSSY has U at index1? So at index2? wrong? Then mark U as present but wrong position? -> -
 Position 3: S? Correct? ✓
 Position 4: Y? FUSSY ends in Y? So correct? ✓

 So we can distinguish? 

 But regardless, we are gathering information.

 We also have other words? 

 Another word: ""MUSSY"": meaning messy? M-U-S-S-Y? 
 M(0), U(1), S(2), S(3), Y(4)? 
 Then S is at index3? So M-U-S-S-Y? Then index3 is S? And no R,A,I,E.

 That's also valid? 

 However, I think ""LOUSY"" is fine? Or even ""TOUSY""? 

 Let me choose ""LOUSY"" because it has two vowels? 

 Also, note: the consonants we haven't tested: T, N, D, etc.

 Alternatively, ""YOUNG"" has no S? 

 Since we must fix S at position 3? We don't have much choice? 

 So I'll go with ""lousy"".

 But wait: let's check: ""lousy"" has S at position 3? Yes: L O U S Y -> positions: 
 0:L
 1:O
 2:U
 3:S 
 4:Y

 So yes.

 Therefore, I choose ""LOUSY"".

 Response: <guess>lousy</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":  
- **R, A, I, E** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").  
- **S** is **present and in the correct position** (marked ""✓"" at index 3, the 4th letter).  

### Key Constraints for Next Guess:  
1. The word must have **S at position 3 (index 3)**.  
2. The word **cannot contain R, A, I, or E**.  
3. New letters should be tested to reveal more about the secret word, prioritizing common vowels (like O, U) and consonants.  

### Selected Guess: ""LOUSY""  
- **Why?**  
  - Satisfies S at index 3: `L O U S Y` → `? ? ? ? ?` → `S` is in position 3.  
  - Uses **L, O, U, Y** → Tests two vowels (O, U) and two consonants (L, Y), all new and not excluded.  
  - ""LOUSY"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning inferior or unsatisfactory).  
  - Maximizes letter coverage: Since R, A, I, E are out, this guess efficiently probes other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

That\'s not a common word.\n\n Actually, let me think: words with the fourth letter S? That would be words ending in \'S\'? Not necessarily, because position 3 is the fourth character? For example: ""CRASS"" -> C-R-A-S-S? Then: \n Index 0: C\n Index 1: R -> but R is forbidden? We know R is absent.\n\n Since R is absent, we can\'t use R.\n\n Another example: ""COSTS"" -> C-O-S-T-S? That\'s C at index 0, O at 1, S at 2, T at 3, S at 4. So index 3 is T? Then not S.\n\n How about ""JUMPS"" -> J-U-M-P-S: \n J(0), U(1), M(2), P(3), S(4) -> index 3 P? Not S.\n\n Actually, we need the letter at index 3 to be S. So the word must end with \'S\'? Only if index 3 is the fourth character and index 4 is fifth, so the word pattern is _ _ _ S _\n\n But wait: the word ends at index 4? So it\'s not necessarily the last letter? Example: ""CHAOS"" -> C-H-A-O-S: \n index 0: C, 1: H, 2: A -> forbidden (A absent), 3: O, 4: S? So index 3 is O.\n\n How about ""FUSSY"": F-U-S-S-Y -> \n F(0), U(1), S(2), S(3), Y(4) -> This has S at index 3? Yes!\n\n However, we also have S at index 2? That\'s duplicate S? But we don\'t know how many S the secret word has. Our feedback only said one S at index 3? Actually, in the first guess, we only had one S and it was correct. But the word could have more S? However, our feedback didn\'t show any other S? But our guess only had one S.\n\n Actually, the word ""raise"" only had one S. So the feedback for S was correct at index 3? That doesn\'t say about duplicate S? Wait: if the secret word had another S at another position? Then in the first guess we didn\'t guess an S at that position? So it wouldn\'t show up? This is tricky.\n\n According to the rules: the feedback for each letter is independent? Actually, no: I recall in Wordle, if there is a duplicate letter, it can be marked only if it appears that many times? But let me recall the exact rule:\n\n Typically: \n - If a letter is in the word and in the correct position, it gets ✓.\n - If a letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets -.\n - But if a letter appears more times in the guess than in the secret word, then the excess will be marked as x.\n\n However, in our feedback for ""raise"", we have R(x), A(x), I(x), S(✓), E(x). Since we didn\'t have any other S, we cannot be sure if there are multiple S? So it\'s possible.\n\n But here, since we know S is at index 3, we must choose a word that has S at index 3? And we are free to choose other letters? We should avoid R, A, I, E.\n\n So for next guess, we want:\n - A word that has S at position 3 (index 3).\n - Does not contain R, A, I, E.\n - And we want to test other common letters? Like consonants? Or vowels O, U, Y.\n\n So let me think of words that fit: pattern _ _ _ S _ (where the fifth character can be anything).\n\n For example:\n - ""PULPS"": P-U-L-P-S -> index 3 is P? no, index 3 would be the fourth letter: so letters 0:P, 1:U, 2:L, 3:P, 4:S -> index 3 is P? Not S.\n\n Correction: the pattern must have the fourth letter (index 3) be S.\n\n How about:\n ""TONUS"" -> T-O-N-U-S? But then index 3 is U? not S.\n\n ""MOUSE"": M-O-U-S-E -> \n M(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), E(4) -> Ah! index 3 is S? Yes. But wait: E is absent? We know E is absent? So we can\'t have E at the end? Because feedback told us E is not in the word? So ""MOUSE"" has E? So it\'s invalid because we know E is absent? And also we don\'t want to use E because it\'s not in the word.\n\n Therefore, we must choose a word that has:\n - S at index 3\n - and no letters from R,A,I,E.\n\n And the fifth letter cannot be E? So we can\'t use words ending in ES? \n\n What are words with S at position 3? Also, without R,A,I,E.\n\n Let me try:\n\n ""JOUST"": J-O-U-S-T -> \n J(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), T(4) -> so index 3 is S? Actually: \n In ""JOUST"", the letters are: \n Position 0: J\n Position 1: O\n Position 2: U\n Position 3: S? \n Wait, no: J-O-U-S-T? That would be 5 letters: J-O-U-S-T -> positions: \n 0:J, 1:O, 2:U, 3:S, 4:T? So index 3 is S? Yes! And T at the end? \n\n This word doesn’t contain R,A,I,E? Let\'s check: J,O,U,S,T -> none of R,A,I,E. \n\n Also, ""joust"" is a valid English word (meaning to engage in combat).\n\n Alternatively, other words? \n ""DOUTS"" -> D-O-U-T-S? but then index 3 is T? S is at the end.\n ""GUSTO"": G-U-S-T-O? Then index 0:G, 1:U, 2:S -> so we have S at index 2? But we need index 3? Then not.\n ""BUSTY"": B-U-S-T-Y -> index 0:B, 1:U, 2:S -> again index 2? Not index 3.\n\n Actually, for S at index 3, the words are much less common? \n\n Another idea: ""FUSSY"" that I thought earlier? F-U-S-S-Y? \n Index 0:F, 1:U, 2:S, 3:S, 4:Y -> so index 3 is S? It has two S? That\'s okay? \n\n And the word ""fussy""? Valid English word? Meaning overly concerned?\n\n So let\'s see: \n ""fussy"" has F, U, S, S, Y -> and no R,A,I,E? Correct? So that\'s an option.\n\n However, note that we already know that the secret word has an S? And if we guess a word with two S, then we can figure out if there is a second S? Because if the secret word has two S, then both could be marked? \n\n But what if the secret word has only one S? Then in ""fussy"", the first S (index 2) would be marked as absent (because there is already one S accounted for at index 3) and the S at index 3 would be ✓? But let me simulate:\n\n Suppose secret word is ""JOUST"" (which has one S). Guess ""fussy"":\n Position 0: F? not in JOUST -> x\n Position 1: U? JOUST has U? But at position 2? So wrong position? so mark for U: - (wrong position) \n Position 2: S? But secret word has only one S and it\'s at position 3? So there is no S at position 2? And we already account for the S? So should be x? \n Position 3: S? Correct? ✓\n Position 4: Y? JOUST ends with T? So Y not present? -> x\n\n But according to Wordle rules: since the secret word has one S and it is at position 3, the guess has two S: one at position 2 (which is not present) and one at position 3 (correct). So the S at position 2 would be marked as absent? So F(x), U(-), S(x), S(✓), Y(x) -> FUSSY would show F:x U:? S:x S:✓ Y:x? But note: the first S (at index 2) is marked x because the secret word\'s S is already accounted for by the position 3? So no extra S.\n\n However, if the secret word had two S? Then both would be marked. But we don\'t know.\n\n So guessing a word with two S might be beneficial? Because we can determine the count.\n\n But note: our goal is to find the secret word quickly. We only have 6 tries.\n\n Alternatively, we can guess a word with only the known S and new letters? To maximize letter testing.\n\n Since we haven\'t tested many letters: \n\n Known absent: R, A, I, E.\n Known present: S (at index 3).\n\n We need to test O, U, Y? Or consonants? \n\n But let me consider: we have to choose a word with S at index 3? So what\'s better? ""JOUST"" or ""FUSSY""? \n\n Both are valid. \n\n ""JOUST"" includes J, O, U, S, T -> S at index 3? Actually, wait: \n J-O-U-S? That\'s 4 letters? Then T? So J-O-U-S-T: \n position 0: J -> uncommon?\n position 1: O\n position 2: U\n position 3: S? Actually, the word ""JOUST"" is spelled J-O-U-S-T? I think yes? \n\n Actually, in some dictionaries, ""joust"" is acceptable? We can use it.\n\n Alternatively, ""COSTS"" -> but then we have C-O-S-T-S? \n position 0: C, 1:O, 2:S -> then position 3:T -> that\'s not S? So invalid? \n\n Another word: ""MUSTY"": M-U-S-T-Y -> \n M(0), U(1), S(2), T(3), Y(4) -> then S is at index 2? Not index 3.\n\n ""BUSKS"": B-U-S-K-S -> \n B(0), U(1), S(2), K(3), S(4) -> index 3 is K? not S.\n\n So word with S at index 3? Actually, let me list:\n\n - ""BOUSY"" -> not common.\n - ""CLOUTS"" -> that\'s 6 letters? wait, 5: C-L-O-U-T-S? -> position 3 would be U? no, indexing: \n   C at 0, L at 1, O at 2, U at 3, T at 4 -> then the last letter? Wait, 5 letters: CLOUT (if no S) -> but ""CLOUTS"" is 6? \n\n I found: ""BOOSTS"" -> 6 letters? \n\n Actually, ""FUSSY"" is good: F-U-S-S-Y -> it has two S? So index 3 is the second S? But still index 3 is S? Yes? \n\n Alternatively, ""MANUS"" -> M-A-N-U-S? But A is forbidden? \n\n Another: ""FOCUS"" -> F-O-C-U-S -> index 3 is U? not S? Because F(0), O(1), C(2), U(3), S(4) -> so index 3 is U and index 4 is S? \n\n But we need index 3 to be S? \n\n How about ""FRASS"" -> F-R-A-S-S? But R and A forbidden? \n\n So ""YOUTH"" doesn\'t have S? \n\n I think ""JOUST"" is acceptable? Or ""TOUSY""? ""TOUSY"" is an adjective meaning disorderly? T-O-U-S-Y? \n T(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), Y(4)? \n\n Yes! And it doesn\'t have R,A,I,E? If we believe that ""tousy"" is a valid word? It might be in some dictionaries? But let\'s try a more common one.\n\n Alternatively, ""LOUSY"": L-O-U-S-Y? \n L(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), Y(4) -> yes! \n And L, O, U, S, Y -> no R,A,I,E? \n The word ""lousy"" means extremely disgusting? But commonly used? \n\n So I choose ""LOUSY"" because it\'s more common? \n\n But note: we are using S at the position we need? And we get to test L, O, U, Y? \n\n So let\'s plan:\n\n We guess ""LOUSY"": L-O-U-S-Y\n\n What happens if the secret word has O, U, Y? And S? \n\n But also, if the secret word is ""JOUST"", then with ""LOUSY"":\n L: absent? because JOUST: J,O,U,S,T -> L is absent? Then L(x), O(✓) because at position 1? Actually, JOUST has O at position 1? So same? \n Position 0: L? not in JOUST? -> x\n Position 1: O? in JOUST at the same position? -> ✓\n Position 2: U? in JOUST at the same position? -> ✓? Actually, JOUST: O at index1, U at index2? So in LO-USY: L,O,U,S,Y? So O at index1? Correct? U at index2? Correct? Then S at index3? Correct? Y at index4? But JOUST ends with T? So Y absent? \n\n So feedback for LOUSY against JOUST: L(x) O(✓) U(✓) S(✓) Y(x)? \n\n But if the secret word is ""FUSSY"", then:\n Position 0: L? vs FUSSY: F? -> L absent? -> x\n Position 1: O? FUSSY: U at index1? So no O? -> x? \n Position 2: U? FUSSY has U at index1? So at index2? wrong? Then mark U as present but wrong position? -> -\n Position 3: S? Correct? ✓\n Position 4: Y? FUSSY ends in Y? So correct? ✓\n\n So we can distinguish? \n\n But regardless, we are gathering information.\n\n We also have other words? \n\n Another word: ""MUSSY"": meaning messy? M-U-S-S-Y? \n M(0), U(1), S(2), S(3), Y(4)? \n Then S is at index3? So M-U-S-S-Y? Then index3 is S? And no R,A,I,E.\n\n That\'s also valid? \n\n However, I think ""LOUSY"" is fine? Or even ""TOUSY""? \n\n Let me choose ""LOUSY"" because it has two vowels? \n\n Also, note: the consonants we haven\'t tested: T, N, D, etc.\n\n Alternatively, ""YOUNG"" has no S? \n\n Since we must fix S at position 3? We don\'t have much choice? \n\n So I\'ll go with ""lousy"".\n\n But wait: let\'s check: ""lousy"" has S at position 3? Yes: L O U S Y -> positions: \n 0:L\n 1:O\n 2:U\n 3:S \n 4:Y\n\n So yes.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""LOUSY"".\n\n Response: <guess>lousy</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":  \n- **R, A, I, E** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").  \n- **S** is **present and in the correct position** (marked ""✓"" at index 3, the 4th letter).  \n\n### Key Constraints for Next Guess:  \n1. The word must have **S at position 3 (index 3)**.  \n2. The word **cannot contain R, A, I, or E**.  \n3. New letters should be tested to reveal more about the secret word, prioritizing common vowels (like O, U) and consonants.  \n\n### Selected Guess: ""LOUSY""  \n- **Why?**  \n  - Satisfies S at index 3: `L O U S Y` → `? ? ? ? ?` → `S` is in position 3.  \n  - Uses **L, O, U, Y** → Tests two vowels (O, U) and two consonants (L, Y), all new and not excluded.  \n  - ""LOUSY"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning inferior or unsatisfactory).  \n  - Maximizes letter coverage: Since R, A, I, E are out, this guess efficiently probes other common letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\n<guess>lousy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: lousy -> FEEDBACK: L(-) O(-) U(x) S(✓) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise"" -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
This means:
- R, A, I, E are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, index 3).

Guess 2: ""lousy"" -> L(-) O(-) U(x) S(✓) Y(x)
This means:
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with '-')
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (marked with '-')
- U is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, index 3) — we already knew this.
- Y is not in the word (x)

So now we know:

1. The secret word has S at position 3 (index 3).
2. The secret word contains L and O, but not at the positions they were in ""lousy"":
   - In ""lousy"", L was at index 0, so L is not at index 0 in the secret word.
   - In ""lousy"", O was at index 1, so O is not at index 1 in the secret word.
3. The secret word does not contain: R, A, I, E, U, Y.

Also, from the first guess, we know the word does not have R, A, I, E.

So absent letters: R, A, I, E, U, Y.

Present letters (besides S): L and O.

We also know the positions for L and O are not at index 0 and 1 respectively.

Now, the secret word has:
- Position 3 (index 3) is S.
- It has L and O, but not at index 0 (for L) and not at index 1 (for O).

We need to form a new guess that:
- Has S at index 3.
- Includes L and O (to confirm their positions? Actually, we already know they are present, so we can try to place them in new positions to find the correct one).
- Avoids R, A, I, E, U, Y.

Also, we should try to test new letters to narrow down possibilities.

What letters are left? We have used: R, A, I, S, E, L, O, U, Y.

So available consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

Vowels: We have used A, E, I, O, U, Y. So the only vowel left? Actually, we have O already (which is present) and no other vowels? But note: sometimes Y is a vowel, but we know Y is absent. So the only vowel we have is O? But we might have words without vowels? Unlikely. So probably O is the only vowel in the word? Or maybe there are no other vowels? But we have L and O? So the word has at least O as a vowel.

But note: we don't know if there are other vowels? We haven't tested all. We have only tested A, E, I, O, U, Y. So the only vowel left? Actually, that's all the vowels? Unless we consider W as a vowel in some words? But typically, we have A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y. So we have tested all? So the secret word must have O (since we know O is present) and possibly no other vowels? But it could have a Y? But we know Y is absent? So only O is the vowel? And consonants.

So the word has: O, L, S (at position 3), and two other letters from the available set.

Now, for the next guess, we want to place L and O in positions that are not 0 and 1 (since we know they are not there) and also not position 3 (because that is S). So available positions: 0,1,2,4? But note: we have to assign L and O to two of these positions? And we have two more letters to choose.

But we don't know the correct positions for L and O. So we should try to put them in positions we haven't tried? And also test new letters.

We know L cannot be at index 0? And O cannot be at index 1? But they could be at other positions.

Possible positions for L: 1,2,4 (since 0 is forbidden and 3 is S).
Possible positions for O: 0,2,4 (since 1 is forbidden and 3 is S).

We also need to test new letters? So we should choose a word that has:
- S at index 3.
- L and O in the word, but at positions that are not their forbidden ones? And we want to try to put them in positions that might be correct? Or to get more information.

Alternatively, we can try to fix one of them? But we don't know.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern and constraints.

The word pattern: _ _ _ S _ 

We know the word has L and O? And S at index 3? And no R,A,I,E,U,Y.

So the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3] S [letter5]

Where:
- letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5 are from the available set: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Z and O and L? But note: O and L must appear somewhere? So two of these positions must be O and L? And the other two are new letters.

But we have to assign O and L to two of the four positions? But note: the positions for O and L have constraints: L cannot be at position 0? O cannot be at position 1? So:

- Position 0: cannot be L? So it must be either O or a new letter? But O can be at position 0? Because we haven't tried O at 0? Only at 1? So O can be at 0? 
- Position 1: cannot be O? So it must be L or a new letter? But L can be at position 1? Because we only know L is not at 0? So L can be at 1? 
- Position 2: can be O or L or new.
- Position 4: can be O or L or new.

But we must have both O and L in the word? So two of these positions must be O and L? And the other two positions must be new letters? Actually, we have four positions to fill? And we have two letters that must be included (O and L)? So we need to choose two more letters? And assign all.

So the word has five letters: 
- Position 0: not L? 
- Position 1: not O?
- Position 3: S
- The word must contain O and L.

Now, let's try to form such a word.

We can try to put O at position 0? Then position 1 must be not O? So that's okay? Then we can put L at position 2? Then position 4 is a new letter? And position 1 must be a new letter? 

Example: O _ L S _ 

So pattern: O ? L S ?

We need to fill the two blanks? With letters from available set? And the word must be valid.

What words? 
- ""OILSS"" -> but I is absent? and duplicate S? 
- We cannot use I? 

Available letters: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Z.

Try: ""COLTS"" -> C O L T S? 
But then: 
Position 0: C
Position 1: O -> but wait, we put O at position 0? In this pattern we are trying O at 0? But in ""COLTS"", O is at position 1? That doesn't match.

We are trying pattern: O at 0, then position 1 is ?, position 2 is L, position 3 is S, position 4 is ?

So: O ? L S ?

What words? 
- ""OFLS?"" -> not a word.
- ""OMLST"" -> not a word.

How about ""OLLAS""? But has A? absent? and duplicate L? 

Not many words? 

Alternatively, put O at position 2? Then L at position 1? But position 1 cannot be O? But it can be L? 

Pattern: _ L O S _ 

But position 1: L? That's allowed? Because we only know L is not at 0? So L at 1 is okay? 

Then pattern: ? L O S ?

Words: 
- ""BLOST"" -> B L O S T? 
  - Check: B(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), T(4) -> S at 3? yes.
  - Letters: B, L, O, S, T -> no R,A,I,E,U,Y? 
  - Is ""BLOST"" a word? I think not? 

- ""CLOPS"": C L O P S? 
  - C(0), L(1), O(2), P(3)? But wait, position 3 must be S? So P at 3? Then S at 4? But we need S at 3? So no.

Pattern: ? L O S ? -> so position 0: ?, position1: L, position2: O, position3: S, position4: ?

So the word must have S at position 3? So the fourth letter is S? Then the fifth letter is the last.

So the word is: [letter0] L O S [letter4]

So the word ends with ""LOS"" + letter? Actually, the word is: [0] + L + O + S + [4]? 

So the word is like ?LOS?

Examples: 
- ""CLOSE"" -> but E is absent? 
- ""BLOBS"" -> B L O B S? Then position 3 is B? not S? 
- ""BLOGS"" -> B L O G S? 
  - Position 0: B
  - Position 1: L
  - Position 2: O
  - Position 3: G? -> but we need S at 3? So no.

Wait, in this pattern, position 3 is the fourth character? So the word: 
character0: ?
character1: L
character2: O
character3: S? -> but we are putting S at position 3? Then the word is ...? 

But in the pattern, we have fixed position 3 as S? So the word is: [0] [1] [2] S [4]? 

But in the above, we are trying to put L at 1 and O at 2? So: 
[0] L O S [4]

So the word is: X L O S Y? But Y is absent? 

What words have the form ?LOS? and the last letter is not Y? 

- ""CLOST"" -> not a word.
- ""GLOST"" -> not common? 
- ""FLOSS"" -> F L O S S? 
  - Then: F(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), S(4) -> so position 3 is S? Yes? 
  - But we have two S? That's okay? 
  - And letters: F, L, O, S, S -> no R,A,I,E,U,Y? 
  - ""Floss"" is a valid word? Yes.

But note: we already know S is present? And we are testing if there is a second S? 

So ""FLOSS"" is a candidate.

But we also have the constraint that L cannot be at index 0? But in ""FLOSS"", L is at index 1? Which is allowed? And O is at index 2? Which is allowed? 

So let's consider ""FLOSS"".

Alternatively, put O at position 0? Then we have pattern: O ? ? S ? 

And we need to include L? So L must be at one of the positions: 1,2,4? 

But position 1 cannot be O? But we have O at 0? So position 1 can be L? 

Pattern: O L ? S ? 

Then: O L ? S ? 

Words: 
- ""OLPUS"" -> not a word? 
- ""OLDS?"" -> but D is available? ""OLDS"" is 4 letters? 
- ""OLDs"" -> but we need 5: O L D S ? -> then we need a fifth letter? 
  - ""OLDS"" is 4, so not.

- ""OLPES"" -> E absent? 

Not many.

Put O at position 4? Then we have pattern: ? ? ? S O 

And we need to include L? So L must be at 0,1,2? But L cannot be at 0? So L at 1 or 2? 

Pattern: ? L ? S O  OR ? ? L S O 

First: ? L ? S O 
- ""BLPSO"" -> not a word.
- ""CLASO"" -> A absent? 
- ""FLTSO"" -> not a word.

Second: ? ? L S O 
- ""COLSO"" -> not common? 
- ""TULSO"" -> U absent? 
- ""PULSO"" -> U absent? 

Not many.

Put L at position 4? Then we have pattern: ? ? ? S L 

And O must be at 0,1,2? But O cannot be at 1? So O at 0 or 2? 

Pattern: O ? ? S L  OR ? O ? S L 

First: O ? ? S L 
- ""O M P S L"" -> not a word.

Second: ? O ? S L 
- ""B O P S L"" -> not a word.
- ""T O M S L"" -> not a word.

So it seems ""FLOSS"" is a good candidate? 

But let's see if there are other words.

Another idea: put L at position 2? and O at position 4? Then pattern: ? ? L S O 

Words: 
- ""??LSO"" 
- ""PULSO"" -> U absent? 
- ""MOLSO"" -> M O L S O? 
  - M(0), O(1), L(2), S(3), O(4) -> but O at position 1? which is forbidden? Because we know O is not at index 1? 

In ""MOLSO"", O is at index 1? So that's not allowed? 

- ""COLSO"" -> C O L S O? O at index 1? forbidden.

- ""HOLMS"" -> H O L M S? 
  - H(0), O(1), L(2), M(3), S(4) -> but position 3 is M? not S? We need S at index 3? 

So not.

Another pattern: put L at position 1? and O at position 4? Then: ? L ? S O 

Words: 
- ""B L I S O"" -> I absent? 
- ""B L A S O"" -> A absent? 
- ""C L O S O"" -> O at position 2? and O at 4? 
  - C(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), O(4) -> S at 3? yes? 
  - But O at position 2? which is allowed? 
  - ""CLOSO"" is not a common word? 

- ""FLOSO"" -> F L O S O? 
  - F(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), O(4) -> S at 3? 
  - But is ""floso"" a word? I don't think so.

So ""FLOSS"" seems the best so far? 

But note: in ""FLOSS"", we have:
- F at 0 (new)
- L at 1 (we know L is present, but we are trying it at position 1? which is allowed? because we only know L is not at 0? so it could be at 1? 
- O at 2 (we know O is present, and we are trying at 2? which is allowed? because we only know O is not at 1? so 2 is okay)
- S at 3 (correct)
- S at 4 (new, but we are testing if there is a second S)

So if we guess ""FLOSS"", we can get information about F and the second S? 

But also, if the secret word does not have F, then we know? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have duplicate S? And tests more new letters? 

For example, put L at position 4? and O at position 0? Then pattern: O ? ? S L 

Words: 
- ""O C T S L"" -> not a word.
- ""O M N S L"" -> not a word.

Not working.

Put O at position 0 and L at position 2? Pattern: O ? L S ? 

Words: 
- ""O F L S ?"" -> ""OFLS"" and then? 
- ""OFLES"" -> E absent? 
- ""OILSS"" -> I absent? 
- ""OWLSS"" -> W is available? ""OWLSS"" is not a word? 

""OWLS"" is 4 letters? 

How about ""OLLAS"" -> A absent? 

Not working.

Another idea: put L at position 2 and O at position 0? Same as above.

Or put L at position 4 and O at position 2? Pattern: ? ? O S L 

Words: 
- ""B C O S L"" -> not a word.
- ""S C O S L"" -> S at 0? but we are not sure? 
- ""T O O S L"" -> T O O S L? 
  - T(0), O(1), O(2), S(3), L(4) -> but O at position 1? which is forbidden? 

So not.

After trying, ""FLOSS"" seems a valid word that fits? 

But let me check if there are other words? 

What about ""CLOTS"": C L O T S? 
- C(0), L(1), O(2), T(3), S(4) -> but position 3 is T? not S? We need S at 3? 

Not.

""BOLTS"": B O L T S? 
- B(0), O(1), L(2), T(3), S(4) -> position 3 is T? not S? 

Not.

""POLES"": E absent? 

""DOLLS"": D O L L S? 
- D(0), O(1), L(2), L(3), S(4) -> position 3 is L? not S? 

Not.

""FLOWS"": F L O W S? 
- F(0), L(1), O(2), W(3), S(4) -> position 3 is W? not S? 

Not.

""GLOSS"": G L O S S? 
- G(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), S(4) -> this is similar to ""FLOSS"", but with G? 

""GLOSS"" is a word? Yes, meaning shine? 

And it has S at position 3? 

And letters: G, L, O, S, S -> no R,A,I,E,U,Y? 

So ""GLOSS"" is also a candidate? 

Similarly, ""SLOSH"": S L O S H? 
- S(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), H(4) -> but position 0 is S? but we don't know if S is at 0? But we know there is an S at 3? and if there is another S? 
- But also, in ""SLOSH"", we have S at 0 and S at 3? 
- But we are allowed? 
- However, we know L is present? and O? 
- But in ""SLOSH"", L is at 1? O at 2? 
- But we also have S at 0? which we don't know if it is present? 

But note: we know the secret word has S at position 3? But it might have another S? 

But in ""SLOSH"", we are putting S at 0? which is a new position? 

But also, we are testing H? 

But the problem: we know L cannot be at 0? and in ""SLOSH"", L is at 1? which is allowed? O at 2? allowed? 

But is ""SLOSH"" valid? Yes? 

But we have to avoid using absent letters? H is not used? 

But let's compare to ""FLOSS"" and ""GLOSS"". 

We can choose any? 

But we want to test new letters? 

In ""FLOSS"", we test F? 
In ""GLOSS"", we test G? 
In ""SLOSH"", we test S at 0 and H? 

But we already know S is present? But we don't know if there is a second S? 

But in ""SLOSH"", we are testing S at 0? which might be present? 

But we have limited guesses? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have duplicate S? To avoid confusion? 

For example, if we can find a word with L and O and S at 3? and two new letters? without duplicate S? 

But earlier attempts failed? 

What about ""LOVES"": E absent? 

""LOOPS"": L O O P S? 
- L(0), O(1), O(2), P(3), S(4) -> position 3 is P? not S? 

Not.

""TOILS"": I absent? 

""COILS"": I absent? 

""POLLS"": P O L L S? 
- P(0), O(1), L(2), L(3), S(4) -> position 3 is L? not S? 

Not.

""BOWLS"": B O W L S? 
- B(0), O(1), W(2), L(3), S(4) -> position 3 is L? not S? 

Not.

""MOLLS"": M O L L S? 
- M(0), O(1), L(2), L(3), S(4) -> position 3 is L? not S? 

Not.

""FOLLY"": Y absent? 

So it seems words with S at position 3 and containing L and O are rare? 

""FLOSS"" and ""GLOSS"" are valid? 

Another one: ""SLOWS"": S L O W S? 
- S(0), L(1), O(2), W(3), S(4) -> position 3 is W? not S? 

Not.

""BLESS"": E absent? 

So I think ""FLOSS"" or ""GLOSS"" are the best? 

Let me choose ""GLOSS"" because G is a common letter? 

But we can also consider ""CLOPS"" but that doesn't have S at 3? 

Another word: ""PLOTS"": P L O T S? 
- P(0), L(1), O(2), T(3), S(4) -> position 3 is T? not S? 

Not.

So I think we have to go with ""FLOSS"" or ""GLOSS"" or ""SLOSH"". 

But ""SLOSH"" has S at 0? which might be a problem? Because if the secret word does not have S at 0, then we get feedback that S at 0 is not present? But we already know S is at 3? So if we get an 'x' for S at 0, that means there is no other S? 

Similarly, in ""FLOSS"", we have S at 4? which is a new position? 

But in ""FLOSS"", we are testing F and the second S? 

Similarly, in ""GLOSS"", we test G and the second S? 

In ""SLOSH"", we test S at 0 and H? 

But we know S is at 3? So if we guess ""SLOSH"", and the secret word has only one S, then the S at 0 will be marked as absent? 

But we want to avoid using S again? But it's okay? 

But let's see the feedback we can get? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have duplicate S? 

What about ""POLKS"": P O L K S? 
- P(0), O(1), L(2), K(3), S(4) -> position 3 is K? not S? 

Not.

""VOLKS"" -> not a word? 

I think we have to accept a word with duplicate S? 

Let me choose ""GLOSS"" as it is a common word? 

But we also have the constraint that in the previous guess ""lousy"", we had L at 0 and O at 1? and now we are trying L at 1 and O at 2? 

So for ""GLOSS"": 
- G at 0: new letter? 
- L at 1: we know L is present, and we are trying position 1? 
- O at 2: we know O is present, and we are trying position 2? 
- S at 3: known
- S at 4: testing if there is a second S? 

If the secret word is, for example, ""CLOPS"" is not possible? 

What could the secret word be? 

We know: 
- S at 3
- L and O present, not at 0 and 1 respectively? 
- No R,A,I,E,U,Y.

Possible words: 
- ""FLOSS"" 
- ""GLOSS""
- ""SLOSH"" (if we consider it)
- ""BLOSS"" -> not a word? 
- ""CLOSH"" -> not common? 

Or ""POLOS"": P O L O S? 
- P(0), O(1), L(2), O(3), S(4) -> position 3 is O? not S? 

Not.

""DOGES"": E absent? 

So very few possibilities? 

Another one: ""LOFTS"": L O F T S? 
- L(0), O(1), F(2), T(3), S(4) -> position 3 is T? not S? 

Not.

So I think ""FLOSS"" and ""GLOSS"" are the main candidates? 

Let me choose ""GLOSS"". 

But we can also consider ""CLOTH"": but H is available? and T? 
- C L O T H? 
- But position 3 must be S? 

Not.

So I'll go with ""GLOSS"". 

But let's confirm the feedback we might get? 

If the secret word is ""FLOSS"", then for ""GLOSS"":
- G: not in FLOSS? -> x
- L: in FLOSS at position 1? -> but in GLOSS, L is at position 1? and in FLOSS, L is at position 1? so correct? ✓
- O: in FLOSS at position 2? and in GLOSS at position 2? so ✓
- S: at position 3? ✓
- S: at position 4? in FLOSS, there is S at 4? so ✓? 

But FLOSS has two S? So both S are present? 

But in feedback, for the second S at position 4? it would be ✓? 

So feedback: G(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(✓) -> but that would be 4 ✓? 

But the secret word is ""FLOSS"", so the first letter is F, not G? So G is wrong? 

But we get three ✓ for L,O,S? and the last S is also ✓? 

But the word is not guessed? 

Alternatively, if the secret word is ""SLOSH"", then for ""GLOSS"":
- G: not in SLOSH? -> x
- L: in SLOSH at position 1? and we have L at 1? so ✓
- O: in SLOSH at position 2? and we have O at 2? so ✓
- S: at 3? ✓
- S: at 4? but SLOSH has H at 4? so S at 4 is not present? and also, SLOSH has only one S? at position 3? so the S at 4 is extra? -> x

So feedback: G(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(x)

Then we know the last letter is not S? 

But we would know the secret word has S only at 3? 

But in this case, we have to guess again? 

But we are on guess 3? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has no duplicate letters? 

But we couldn't find one? 

Another word: ""BROWS"": R absent? 

Not.

"" CROWS"": R absent? 

Not.

""PROWL"": no S? 

I think we have to go with ""GLOSS"" or ""FLOSS"". 

Let me choose ""GLOSS"". 

But we can also try ""CLOMP"": no S? 

Not.

So I'll go with ""GLOSS"". 

But note: in ""GLOSS"", we are putting O at position 2? which is allowed? and L at position 1? allowed? 

So guess: ""GLOSS""

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""raise"" → Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(✓), E(x)**  
   - **S** is in the secret word and **correctly positioned at index 3** (4th letter).  
   - **R, A, I, E** are **absent** from the secret word.  

2. **Guess 2: ""lousy"" → Feedback: L(-), O(-), U(x), S(✓), Y(x)**  
   - **S** is again confirmed at index 3 (✓).  
   - **L and O** are **present** but in **wrong positions**:  
     - L cannot be at index 0.  
     - O cannot be at index 1.  
   - **U and Y** are **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed Letters**:  
  - **S** is fixed at **position 3** (index 3).  
  - **L and O** are in the word but **not** at positions 0 or 1, respectively.  
- **Absent Letters**: R, A, I, E, U, Y.  
- **Possible Positions for L and O**:  
  - L can be at indices **1, 2, or 4** (since index 0 is invalid).  
  - O can be at indices **0, 2, or 4** (since index 1 is invalid).  
- **Untested Letters**: Focus on common consonants (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, T) and the known vowels (only O remains).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must include S at index 3** and **both L and O** to test new positions.  
- **Avoid absent letters** (R, A, I, E, U, Y).  
- **Test new consonants** to maximize information (e.g., G, L, O, S).  
- **Optimal Word Choice**: ""GLOSS"" fits perfectly:  
  - **G** at index 0 (tests a new consonant).  
  - **L** at index 1 (tests a valid position for L).  
  - **O** at index 2 (tests a valid position for O).  
  - **S** at index 3 (confirmed position).  
  - **S** at index 4 (tests for a potential second ""S"").  
- ""GLOSS"" is a valid English word (meaning ""shine"" or ""luster""), adhering to all constraints.  

### Expected Outcomes:
- If **G** is absent, it will be eliminated.  
- Positions of **L (index 1)** and **O (index 2)** will be validated.  
- The second **S (index 4)** tests for duplicates.  

<guess>gloss</guess>",gloss,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise"" -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
This means:
- R, A, I, E are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, index 3).

Guess 2: ""lousy"" -> L(-) O(-) U(x) S(✓) Y(x)
This means:
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with '-')
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (marked with '-')
- U is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, index 3) — we already knew this.
- Y is not in the word (x)

So now we know:

1. The secret word has S at position 3 (index 3).
2. The secret word contains L and O, but not at the positions they were in ""lousy"":
   - In ""lousy"", L was at index 0, so L is not at index 0 in the secret word.
   - In ""lousy"", O was at index 1, so O is not at index 1 in the secret word.
3. The secret word does not contain: R, A, I, E, U, Y.

Also, from the first guess, we know the word does not have R, A, I, E.

So absent letters: R, A, I, E, U, Y.

Present letters (besides S): L and O.

We also know the positions for L and O are not at index 0 and 1 respectively.

Now, the secret word has:
- Position 3 (index 3) is S.
- It has L and O, but not at index 0 (for L) and not at index 1 (for O).

We need to form a new guess that:
- Has S at index 3.
- Includes L and O (to confirm their positions? Actually, we already know they are present, so we can try to place them in new positions to find the correct one).
- Avoids R, A, I, E, U, Y.

Also, we should try to test new letters to narrow down possibilities.

What letters are left? We have used: R, A, I, S, E, L, O, U, Y.

So available consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

Vowels: We have used A, E, I, O, U, Y. So the only vowel left? Actually, we have O already (which is present) and no other vowels? But note: sometimes Y is a vowel, but we know Y is absent. So the only vowel we have is O? But we might have words without vowels? Unlikely. So probably O is the only vowel in the word? Or maybe there are no other vowels? But we have L and O? So the word has at least O as a vowel.

But note: we don't know if there are other vowels? We haven't tested all. We have only tested A, E, I, O, U, Y. So the only vowel left? Actually, that's all the vowels? Unless we consider W as a vowel in some words? But typically, we have A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y. So we have tested all? So the secret word must have O (since we know O is present) and possibly no other vowels? But it could have a Y? But we know Y is absent? So only O is the vowel? And consonants.

So the word has: O, L, S (at position 3), and two other letters from the available set.

Now, for the next guess, we want to place L and O in positions that are not 0 and 1 (since we know they are not there) and also not position 3 (because that is S). So available positions: 0,1,2,4? But note: we have to assign L and O to two of these positions? And we have two more letters to choose.

But we don't know the correct positions for L and O. So we should try to put them in positions we haven't tried? And also test new letters.

We know L cannot be at index 0? And O cannot be at index 1? But they could be at other positions.

Possible positions for L: 1,2,4 (since 0 is forbidden and 3 is S).
Possible positions for O: 0,2,4 (since 1 is forbidden and 3 is S).

We also need to test new letters? So we should choose a word that has:
- S at index 3.
- L and O in the word, but at positions that are not their forbidden ones? And we want to try to put them in positions that might be correct? Or to get more information.

Alternatively, we can try to fix one of them? But we don't know.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern and constraints.

The word pattern: _ _ _ S _ 

We know the word has L and O? And S at index 3? And no R,A,I,E,U,Y.

So the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3] S [letter5]

Where:
- letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5 are from the available set: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Z and O and L? But note: O and L must appear somewhere? So two of these positions must be O and L? And the other two are new letters.

But we have to assign O and L to two of the four positions? But note: the positions for O and L have constraints: L cannot be at position 0? O cannot be at position 1? So:

- Position 0: cannot be L? So it must be either O or a new letter? But O can be at position 0? Because we haven't tried O at 0? Only at 1? So O can be at 0? 
- Position 1: cannot be O? So it must be L or a new letter? But L can be at position 1? Because we only know L is not at 0? So L can be at 1? 
- Position 2: can be O or L or new.
- Position 4: can be O or L or new.

But we must have both O and L in the word? So two of these positions must be O and L? And the other two positions must be new letters? Actually, we have four positions to fill? And we have two letters that must be included (O and L)? So we need to choose two more letters? And assign all.

So the word has five letters: 
- Position 0: not L? 
- Position 1: not O?
- Position 3: S
- The word must contain O and L.

Now, let's try to form such a word.

We can try to put O at position 0? Then position 1 must be not O? So that's okay? Then we can put L at position 2? Then position 4 is a new letter? And position 1 must be a new letter? 

Example: O _ L S _ 

So pattern: O ? L S ?

We need to fill the two blanks? With letters from available set? And the word must be valid.

What words? 
- ""OILSS"" -> but I is absent? and duplicate S? 
- We cannot use I? 

Available letters: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Z.

Try: ""COLTS"" -> C O L T S? 
But then: 
Position 0: C
Position 1: O -> but wait, we put O at position 0? In this pattern we are trying O at 0? But in ""COLTS"", O is at position 1? That doesn't match.

We are trying pattern: O at 0, then position 1 is ?, position 2 is L, position 3 is S, position 4 is ?

So: O ? L S ?

What words? 
- ""OFLS?"" -> not a word.
- ""OMLST"" -> not a word.

How about ""OLLAS""? But has A? absent? and duplicate L? 

Not many words? 

Alternatively, put O at position 2? Then L at position 1? But position 1 cannot be O? But it can be L? 

Pattern: _ L O S _ 

But position 1: L? That's allowed? Because we only know L is not at 0? So L at 1 is okay? 

Then pattern: ? L O S ?

Words: 
- ""BLOST"" -> B L O S T? 
  - Check: B(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), T(4) -> S at 3? yes.
  - Letters: B, L, O, S, T -> no R,A,I,E,U,Y? 
  - Is ""BLOST"" a word? I think not? 

- ""CLOPS"": C L O P S? 
  - C(0), L(1), O(2), P(3)? But wait, position 3 must be S? So P at 3? Then S at 4? But we need S at 3? So no.

Pattern: ? L O S ? -> so position 0: ?, position1: L, position2: O, position3: S, position4: ?

So the word must have S at position 3? So the fourth letter is S? Then the fifth letter is the last.

So the word is: [letter0] L O S [letter4]

So the word ends with ""LOS"" + letter? Actually, the word is: [0] + L + O + S + [4]? 

So the word is like ?LOS?

Examples: 
- ""CLOSE"" -> but E is absent? 
- ""BLOBS"" -> B L O B S? Then position 3 is B? not S? 
- ""BLOGS"" -> B L O G S? 
  - Position 0: B
  - Position 1: L
  - Position 2: O
  - Position 3: G? -> but we need S at 3? So no.

Wait, in this pattern, position 3 is the fourth character? So the word: 
character0: ?
character1: L
character2: O
character3: S? -> but we are putting S at position 3? Then the word is ...? 

But in the pattern, we have fixed position 3 as S? So the word is: [0] [1] [2] S [4]? 

But in the above, we are trying to put L at 1 and O at 2? So: 
[0] L O S [4]

So the word is: X L O S Y? But Y is absent? 

What words have the form ?LOS? and the last letter is not Y? 

- ""CLOST"" -> not a word.
- ""GLOST"" -> not common? 
- ""FLOSS"" -> F L O S S? 
  - Then: F(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), S(4) -> so position 3 is S? Yes? 
  - But we have two S? That's okay? 
  - And letters: F, L, O, S, S -> no R,A,I,E,U,Y? 
  - ""Floss"" is a valid word? Yes.

But note: we already know S is present? And we are testing if there is a second S? 

So ""FLOSS"" is a candidate.

But we also have the constraint that L cannot be at index 0? But in ""FLOSS"", L is at index 1? Which is allowed? And O is at index 2? Which is allowed? 

So let's consider ""FLOSS"".

Alternatively, put O at position 0? Then we have pattern: O ? ? S ? 

And we need to include L? So L must be at one of the positions: 1,2,4? 

But position 1 cannot be O? But we have O at 0? So position 1 can be L? 

Pattern: O L ? S ? 

Then: O L ? S ? 

Words: 
- ""OLPUS"" -> not a word? 
- ""OLDS?"" -> but D is available? ""OLDS"" is 4 letters? 
- ""OLDs"" -> but we need 5: O L D S ? -> then we need a fifth letter? 
  - ""OLDS"" is 4, so not.

- ""OLPES"" -> E absent? 

Not many.

Put O at position 4? Then we have pattern: ? ? ? S O 

And we need to include L? So L must be at 0,1,2? But L cannot be at 0? So L at 1 or 2? 

Pattern: ? L ? S O  OR ? ? L S O 

First: ? L ? S O 
- ""BLPSO"" -> not a word.
- ""CLASO"" -> A absent? 
- ""FLTSO"" -> not a word.

Second: ? ? L S O 
- ""COLSO"" -> not common? 
- ""TULSO"" -> U absent? 
- ""PULSO"" -> U absent? 

Not many.

Put L at position 4? Then we have pattern: ? ? ? S L 

And O must be at 0,1,2? But O cannot be at 1? So O at 0 or 2? 

Pattern: O ? ? S L  OR ? O ? S L 

First: O ? ? S L 
- ""O M P S L"" -> not a word.

Second: ? O ? S L 
- ""B O P S L"" -> not a word.
- ""T O M S L"" -> not a word.

So it seems ""FLOSS"" is a good candidate? 

But let's see if there are other words.

Another idea: put L at position 2? and O at position 4? Then pattern: ? ? L S O 

Words: 
- ""??LSO"" 
- ""PULSO"" -> U absent? 
- ""MOLSO"" -> M O L S O? 
  - M(0), O(1), L(2), S(3), O(4) -> but O at position 1? which is forbidden? Because we know O is not at index 1? 

In ""MOLSO"", O is at index 1? So that's not allowed? 

- ""COLSO"" -> C O L S O? O at index 1? forbidden.

- ""HOLMS"" -> H O L M S? 
  - H(0), O(1), L(2), M(3), S(4) -> but position 3 is M? not S? We need S at index 3? 

So not.

Another pattern: put L at position 1? and O at position 4? Then: ? L ? S O 

Words: 
- ""B L I S O"" -> I absent? 
- ""B L A S O"" -> A absent? 
- ""C L O S O"" -> O at position 2? and O at 4? 
  - C(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), O(4) -> S at 3? yes? 
  - But O at position 2? which is allowed? 
  - ""CLOSO"" is not a common word? 

- ""FLOSO"" -> F L O S O? 
  - F(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), O(4) -> S at 3? 
  - But is ""floso"" a word? I don't think so.

So ""FLOSS"" seems the best so far? 

But note: in ""FLOSS"", we have:
- F at 0 (new)
- L at 1 (we know L is present, but we are trying it at position 1? which is allowed? because we only know L is not at 0? so it could be at 1? 
- O at 2 (we know O is present, and we are trying at 2? which is allowed? because we only know O is not at 1? so 2 is okay)
- S at 3 (correct)
- S at 4 (new, but we are testing if there is a second S)

So if we guess ""FLOSS"", we can get information about F and the second S? 

But also, if the secret word does not have F, then we know? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have duplicate S? And tests more new letters? 

For example, put L at position 4? and O at position 0? Then pattern: O ? ? S L 

Words: 
- ""O C T S L"" -> not a word.
- ""O M N S L"" -> not a word.

Not working.

Put O at position 0 and L at position 2? Pattern: O ? L S ? 

Words: 
- ""O F L S ?"" -> ""OFLS"" and then? 
- ""OFLES"" -> E absent? 
- ""OILSS"" -> I absent? 
- ""OWLSS"" -> W is available? ""OWLSS"" is not a word? 

""OWLS"" is 4 letters? 

How about ""OLLAS"" -> A absent? 

Not working.

Another idea: put L at position 2 and O at position 0? Same as above.

Or put L at position 4 and O at position 2? Pattern: ? ? O S L 

Words: 
- ""B C O S L"" -> not a word.
- ""S C O S L"" -> S at 0? but we are not sure? 
- ""T O O S L"" -> T O O S L? 
  - T(0), O(1), O(2), S(3), L(4) -> but O at position 1? which is forbidden? 

So not.

After trying, ""FLOSS"" seems a valid word that fits? 

But let me check if there are other words? 

What about ""CLOTS"": C L O T S? 
- C(0), L(1), O(2), T(3), S(4) -> but position 3 is T? not S? We need S at 3? 

Not.

""BOLTS"": B O L T S? 
- B(0), O(1), L(2), T(3), S(4) -> position 3 is T? not S? 

Not.

""POLES"": E absent? 

""DOLLS"": D O L L S? 
- D(0), O(1), L(2), L(3), S(4) -> position 3 is L? not S? 

Not.

""FLOWS"": F L O W S? 
- F(0), L(1), O(2), W(3), S(4) -> position 3 is W? not S? 

Not.

""GLOSS"": G L O S S? 
- G(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), S(4) -> this is similar to ""FLOSS"", but with G? 

""GLOSS"" is a word? Yes, meaning shine? 

And it has S at position 3? 

And letters: G, L, O, S, S -> no R,A,I,E,U,Y? 

So ""GLOSS"" is also a candidate? 

Similarly, ""SLOSH"": S L O S H? 
- S(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), H(4) -> but position 0 is S? but we don't know if S is at 0? But we know there is an S at 3? and if there is another S? 
- But also, in ""SLOSH"", we have S at 0 and S at 3? 
- But we are allowed? 
- However, we know L is present? and O? 
- But in ""SLOSH"", L is at 1? O at 2? 
- But we also have S at 0? which we don't know if it is present? 

But note: we know the secret word has S at position 3? But it might have another S? 

But in ""SLOSH"", we are putting S at 0? which is a new position? 

But also, we are testing H? 

But the problem: we know L cannot be at 0? and in ""SLOSH"", L is at 1? which is allowed? O at 2? allowed? 

But is ""SLOSH"" valid? Yes? 

But we have to avoid using absent letters? H is not used? 

But let's compare to ""FLOSS"" and ""GLOSS"". 

We can choose any? 

But we want to test new letters? 

In ""FLOSS"", we test F? 
In ""GLOSS"", we test G? 
In ""SLOSH"", we test S at 0 and H? 

But we already know S is present? But we don't know if there is a second S? 

But in ""SLOSH"", we are testing S at 0? which might be present? 

But we have limited guesses? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have duplicate S? To avoid confusion? 

For example, if we can find a word with L and O and S at 3? and two new letters? without duplicate S? 

But earlier attempts failed? 

What about ""LOVES"": E absent? 

""LOOPS"": L O O P S? 
- L(0), O(1), O(2), P(3), S(4) -> position 3 is P? not S? 

Not.

""TOILS"": I absent? 

""COILS"": I absent? 

""POLLS"": P O L L S? 
- P(0), O(1), L(2), L(3), S(4) -> position 3 is L? not S? 

Not.

""BOWLS"": B O W L S? 
- B(0), O(1), W(2), L(3), S(4) -> position 3 is L? not S? 

Not.

""MOLLS"": M O L L S? 
- M(0), O(1), L(2), L(3), S(4) -> position 3 is L? not S? 

Not.

""FOLLY"": Y absent? 

So it seems words with S at position 3 and containing L and O are rare? 

""FLOSS"" and ""GLOSS"" are valid? 

Another one: ""SLOWS"": S L O W S? 
- S(0), L(1), O(2), W(3), S(4) -> position 3 is W? not S? 

Not.

""BLESS"": E absent? 

So I think ""FLOSS"" or ""GLOSS"" are the best? 

Let me choose ""GLOSS"" because G is a common letter? 

But we can also consider ""CLOPS"" but that doesn't have S at 3? 

Another word: ""PLOTS"": P L O T S? 
- P(0), L(1), O(2), T(3), S(4) -> position 3 is T? not S? 

Not.

So I think we have to go with ""FLOSS"" or ""GLOSS"" or ""SLOSH"". 

But ""SLOSH"" has S at 0? which might be a problem? Because if the secret word does not have S at 0, then we get feedback that S at 0 is not present? But we already know S is at 3? So if we get an 'x' for S at 0, that means there is no other S? 

Similarly, in ""FLOSS"", we have S at 4? which is a new position? 

But in ""FLOSS"", we are testing F and the second S? 

Similarly, in ""GLOSS"", we test G and the second S? 

In ""SLOSH"", we test S at 0 and H? 

But we know S is at 3? So if we guess ""SLOSH"", and the secret word has only one S, then the S at 0 will be marked as absent? 

But we want to avoid using S again? But it's okay? 

But let's see the feedback we can get? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have duplicate S? 

What about ""POLKS"": P O L K S? 
- P(0), O(1), L(2), K(3), S(4) -> position 3 is K? not S? 

Not.

""VOLKS"" -> not a word? 

I think we have to accept a word with duplicate S? 

Let me choose ""GLOSS"" as it is a common word? 

But we also have the constraint that in the previous guess ""lousy"", we had L at 0 and O at 1? and now we are trying L at 1 and O at 2? 

So for ""GLOSS"": 
- G at 0: new letter? 
- L at 1: we know L is present, and we are trying position 1? 
- O at 2: we know O is present, and we are trying position 2? 
- S at 3: known
- S at 4: testing if there is a second S? 

If the secret word is, for example, ""CLOPS"" is not possible? 

What could the secret word be? 

We know: 
- S at 3
- L and O present, not at 0 and 1 respectively? 
- No R,A,I,E,U,Y.

Possible words: 
- ""FLOSS"" 
- ""GLOSS""
- ""SLOSH"" (if we consider it)
- ""BLOSS"" -> not a word? 
- ""CLOSH"" -> not common? 

Or ""POLOS"": P O L O S? 
- P(0), O(1), L(2), O(3), S(4) -> position 3 is O? not S? 

Not.

""DOGES"": E absent? 

So very few possibilities? 

Another one: ""LOFTS"": L O F T S? 
- L(0), O(1), F(2), T(3), S(4) -> position 3 is T? not S? 

Not.

So I think ""FLOSS"" and ""GLOSS"" are the main candidates? 

Let me choose ""GLOSS"". 

But we can also consider ""CLOTH"": but H is available? and T? 
- C L O T H? 
- But position 3 must be S? 

Not.

So I'll go with ""GLOSS"". 

But let's confirm the feedback we might get? 

If the secret word is ""FLOSS"", then for ""GLOSS"":
- G: not in FLOSS? -> x
- L: in FLOSS at position 1? -> but in GLOSS, L is at position 1? and in FLOSS, L is at position 1? so correct? ✓
- O: in FLOSS at position 2? and in GLOSS at position 2? so ✓
- S: at position 3? ✓
- S: at position 4? in FLOSS, there is S at 4? so ✓? 

But FLOSS has two S? So both S are present? 

But in feedback, for the second S at position 4? it would be ✓? 

So feedback: G(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(✓) -> but that would be 4 ✓? 

But the secret word is ""FLOSS"", so the first letter is F, not G? So G is wrong? 

But we get three ✓ for L,O,S? and the last S is also ✓? 

But the word is not guessed? 

Alternatively, if the secret word is ""SLOSH"", then for ""GLOSS"":
- G: not in SLOSH? -> x
- L: in SLOSH at position 1? and we have L at 1? so ✓
- O: in SLOSH at position 2? and we have O at 2? so ✓
- S: at 3? ✓
- S: at 4? but SLOSH has H at 4? so S at 4 is not present? and also, SLOSH has only one S? at position 3? so the S at 4 is extra? -> x

So feedback: G(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(x)

Then we know the last letter is not S? 

But we would know the secret word has S only at 3? 

But in this case, we have to guess again? 

But we are on guess 3? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has no duplicate letters? 

But we couldn't find one? 

Another word: ""BROWS"": R absent? 

Not.

"" CROWS"": R absent? 

Not.

""PROWL"": no S? 

I think we have to go with ""GLOSS"" or ""FLOSS"". 

Let me choose ""GLOSS"". 

But we can also try ""CLOMP"": no S? 

Not.

So I'll go with ""GLOSS"". 

But note: in ""GLOSS"", we are putting O at position 2? which is allowed? and L at position 1? allowed? 

So guess: ""GLOSS""

Response: <guess>gloss</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""raise"" → Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(✓), E(x)**  
   - **S** is in the secret word and **correctly positioned at index 3** (4th letter).  
   - **R, A, I, E** are **absent** from the secret word.  

2. **Guess 2: ""lousy"" → Feedback: L(-), O(-), U(x), S(✓), Y(x)**  
   - **S** is again confirmed at index 3 (✓).  
   - **L and O** are **present** but in **wrong positions**:  
     - L cannot be at index 0.  
     - O cannot be at index 1.  
   - **U and Y** are **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed Letters**:  
  - **S** is fixed at **position 3** (index 3).  
  - **L and O** are in the word but **not** at positions 0 or 1, respectively.  
- **Absent Letters**: R, A, I, E, U, Y.  
- **Possible Positions for L and O**:  
  - L can be at indices **1, 2, or 4** (since index 0 is invalid).  
  - O can be at indices **0, 2, or 4** (since index 1 is invalid).  
- **Untested Letters**: Focus on common consonants (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, T) and the known vowels (only O remains).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must include S at index 3** and **both L and O** to test new positions.  
- **Avoid absent letters** (R, A, I, E, U, Y).  
- **Test new consonants** to maximize information (e.g., G, L, O, S).  
- **Optimal Word Choice**: ""GLOSS"" fits perfectly:  
  - **G** at index 0 (tests a new consonant).  
  - **L** at index 1 (tests a valid position for L).  
  - **O** at index 2 (tests a valid position for O).  
  - **S** at index 3 (confirmed position).  
  - **S** at index 4 (tests for a potential second ""S"").  
- ""GLOSS"" is a valid English word (meaning ""shine"" or ""luster""), adhering to all constraints.  

### Expected Outcomes:
- If **G** is absent, it will be eliminated.  
- Positions of **L (index 1)** and **O (index 2)** will be validated.  
- The second **S (index 4)** tests for duplicates.",Guess 3: gloss -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(-),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are playing wordle and I need to make my first guess.
 Since I have no information, I want a word that has common letters to maximize feedback.
 A good starting word often uses common letters like vowels (A,E,I,O,U) and common consonants (R,S,T,L,N).
 Also, avoiding repeating letters might help get more information.

 Let me think of a word that includes several common letters. 
 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has C,R,A,N,E. But let's check alternatives.

 Another common one is ""SLATE"" which has S,L,A,T,E. 

 However, let's try to cover more different letters. I recall that ""ROATE"" or ""SOARE"" are sometimes used but they are less common.

 But note: the rules don't specify that the word must be common, but it must be valid.

 However, since the feedback uses 5 letters and we are trying to maximize information, let me consider:

 - Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now)
 - Consonants: R, S, T, L, N are very common.

 A word that covers many of these is ""RAISE"" -> R, A, I, S, E. It has three vowels (A,I,E) and two common consonants (R,S).

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" has C,R,A,N,E: two vowels (A,E) and three consonants.

 Perhaps ""RAISE"" is a little better because it has three vowels? But note that the position of vowels might matter.

 After checking, ""RAISE"" is a valid English word (meaning to lift up).

 Therefore, I will choose ""RAISE"" as the first guess.

 Response format: 
 <guess> raise </guess>I need to make an effective first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and vowels. 

- **Common letters**: English words frequently use vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.  
- **Strategy**: Prioritize a word with **3 vowels and 2 common consonants** to increase chances of hitting letters in the secret word.  
- **Choice**: ""RAISE"" is ideal—it contains **R, A, I, S, E**. This covers:  
  - 3 vowels (A, I, E)  
  - 2 high-frequency consonants (R, S)  
  - No duplicate letters, ensuring each letter provides unique feedback.  

This guess will help reveal which letters exist and their positions, setting a strong foundation for subsequent guesses.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
 R(x) -> R is not in the word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the word.
 I(x) -> I is not in the word.
 S(✓) -> S is in the word and in the correct position? Wait, the symbol is '✓' meaning correct position? But in the example, ✓ means correct position.

 However, looking back at the rules: ✓ means the letter is in the word and in the correct position.

 But note: in the feedback for ""raise"", we have S(✓) meaning that S is in the secret word and it is at the same position as in ""raise"", that is, the fourth position (index 3, counting from 0?).

 Also, note that R, A, I, E are all absent.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The letter S is present and is the fourth letter of the secret word (so the word ends with ...S? Actually, no, it's the fourth letter, meaning position 3?).

 But note: the word is 5 letters. So positions: 0,1,2,3,4.
 Since ""raise"" was R-A-I-S-E, the S is at position 3.

 Therefore, the secret word has S as its fourth letter (position 3).

 And R, A, I, E are absent.

 So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, E. Also, it does contain S at position 3.

 Since E is absent, common vowels A, E, I are out. So the secret word must have other vowels? Or it might not? English words must have vowels, so likely vowels: O, U, sometimes Y (if allowed, but typically Wordle uses common words so Y might be allowed).

 However, we are not told that Y is always allowed? But the rules say ""valid 5-letter English word"". So let's consider O, U, and Y (if it's a vowel).

 Now, for the next guess:
 - We must have a word that has S at position 3 (index 3) because we know S is fixed at that position? But note: we don't know the positions of other letters, but S can't be moved? Actually, we can try words that have S at position 3 to get more feedback.

 However, we also know that the word cannot contain R, A, I, E.

 So, when constructing the next word:
 - Must be a 5-letter English word.
 - Must have S at the 4th position (index 3).
 - Must not use R, A, I, E.

 What letters are left? Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Note O and U are vowels.

 Since we don't have many vowels left, we might want to include O or U to see if they are in the word.

 Also, note that S is the only letter we know so far.

 Let's think of words that satisfy:
 - Position 3 (the fourth character) must be S.
 - The other letters: no R, A, I, E.

 Some options:

 Option 1: Try words with O and U? Or common consonants?

 Example: ""FOCUS"" -> F at 0, O at 1, C at 2, U at 4? But wait, position 3 must be S? So ""FOCUS"" doesn't have S at position 3? It ends with U-S? Actually, ""FOCUS"" has letters: 
 0: F, 1: O, 2: C, 3: U, 4: S -> but wait, we need the fourth letter (position 3) to be S? In ""FOCUS"", position 3 is U and position 4 is S? That doesn't match.

 Actually, we need S at position 3 (which is the fourth position in a 5-letter string, since indexing starts at 0: positions 0,1,2,3,4). So S must be at index 3.

 Example: ""HOSTS"" -> but has duplicate S? And S at index 3? Let's break down: 
 H-O-S-T-S? Positions: 0:H, 1:O, 2:S, 3:T, 4:S -> No, the S at index 3 would be T? Actually, no: the word is 5 letters: ""HOSTS"" -> 
 H (0), O (1), S (2), T (3), S (4) -> So index 3 is T? Then not S at index 3.

 We need a word where the character at index 3 is S.

 Examples of words that end with ...S? But note: index 3 is the fourth letter, so the fifth letter can be anything? Actually, the word could be like X X X S X.

 For instance: ""BONUS"" -> B (0), O (1), N (2), U (3), S (4) -> index 3 is U? So that's not S.

 How about ""DENTS"" -> D (0), E (1), N (2), T (3), S (4) -> index 3 is T? No.

 Or ""LANTS"" -> L-A-N-T-S? That's not a common word.

 Actually, let me think: words with the fourth letter S? That would be words ending in 'S'? Not necessarily, because position 3 is the fourth character? For example: ""CRASS"" -> C-R-A-S-S? Then: 
 Index 0: C
 Index 1: R -> but R is forbidden? We know R is absent.

 Since R is absent, we can't use R.

 Another example: ""COSTS"" -> C-O-S-T-S? That's C at index 0, O at 1, S at 2, T at 3, S at 4. So index 3 is T? Then not S.

 How about ""JUMPS"" -> J-U-M-P-S: 
 J(0), U(1), M(2), P(3), S(4) -> index 3 P? Not S.

 Actually, we need the letter at index 3 to be S. So the word must end with 'S'? Only if index 3 is the fourth character and index 4 is fifth, so the word pattern is _ _ _ S _

 But wait: the word ends at index 4? So it's not necessarily the last letter? Example: ""CHAOS"" -> C-H-A-O-S: 
 index 0: C, 1: H, 2: A -> forbidden (A absent), 3: O, 4: S? So index 3 is O.

 How about ""FUSSY"": F-U-S-S-Y -> 
 F(0), U(1), S(2), S(3), Y(4) -> This has S at index 3? Yes!

 However, we also have S at index 2? That's duplicate S? But we don't know how many S the secret word has. Our feedback only said one S at index 3? Actually, in the first guess, we only had one S and it was correct. But the word could have more S? However, our feedback didn't show any other S? But our guess only had one S.

 Actually, the word ""raise"" only had one S. So the feedback for S was correct at index 3? That doesn't say about duplicate S? Wait: if the secret word had another S at another position? Then in the first guess we didn't guess an S at that position? So it wouldn't show up? This is tricky.

 According to the rules: the feedback for each letter is independent? Actually, no: I recall in Wordle, if there is a duplicate letter, it can be marked only if it appears that many times? But let me recall the exact rule:

 Typically: 
 - If a letter is in the word and in the correct position, it gets ✓.
 - If a letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets -.
 - But if a letter appears more times in the guess than in the secret word, then the excess will be marked as x.

 However, in our feedback for ""raise"", we have R(x), A(x), I(x), S(✓), E(x). Since we didn't have any other S, we cannot be sure if there are multiple S? So it's possible.

 But here, since we know S is at index 3, we must choose a word that has S at index 3? And we are free to choose other letters? We should avoid R, A, I, E.

 So for next guess, we want:
 - A word that has S at position 3 (index 3).
 - Does not contain R, A, I, E.
 - And we want to test other common letters? Like consonants? Or vowels O, U, Y.

 So let me think of words that fit: pattern _ _ _ S _ (where the fifth character can be anything).

 For example:
 - ""PULPS"": P-U-L-P-S -> index 3 is P? no, index 3 would be the fourth letter: so letters 0:P, 1:U, 2:L, 3:P, 4:S -> index 3 is P? Not S.

 Correction: the pattern must have the fourth letter (index 3) be S.

 How about:
 ""TONUS"" -> T-O-N-U-S? But then index 3 is U? not S.

 ""MOUSE"": M-O-U-S-E -> 
 M(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), E(4) -> Ah! index 3 is S? Yes. But wait: E is absent? We know E is absent? So we can't have E at the end? Because feedback told us E is not in the word? So ""MOUSE"" has E? So it's invalid because we know E is absent? And also we don't want to use E because it's not in the word.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that has:
 - S at index 3
 - and no letters from R,A,I,E.

 And the fifth letter cannot be E? So we can't use words ending in ES? 

 What are words with S at position 3? Also, without R,A,I,E.

 Let me try:

 ""JOUST"": J-O-U-S-T -> 
 J(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), T(4) -> so index 3 is S? Actually: 
 In ""JOUST"", the letters are: 
 Position 0: J
 Position 1: O
 Position 2: U
 Position 3: S? 
 Wait, no: J-O-U-S-T? That would be 5 letters: J-O-U-S-T -> positions: 
 0:J, 1:O, 2:U, 3:S, 4:T? So index 3 is S? Yes! And T at the end? 

 This word doesn’t contain R,A,I,E? Let's check: J,O,U,S,T -> none of R,A,I,E. 

 Also, ""joust"" is a valid English word (meaning to engage in combat).

 Alternatively, other words? 
 ""DOUTS"" -> D-O-U-T-S? but then index 3 is T? S is at the end.
 ""GUSTO"": G-U-S-T-O? Then index 0:G, 1:U, 2:S -> so we have S at index 2? But we need index 3? Then not.
 ""BUSTY"": B-U-S-T-Y -> index 0:B, 1:U, 2:S -> again index 2? Not index 3.

 Actually, for S at index 3, the words are much less common? 

 Another idea: ""FUSSY"" that I thought earlier? F-U-S-S-Y? 
 Index 0:F, 1:U, 2:S, 3:S, 4:Y -> so index 3 is S? It has two S? That's okay? 

 And the word ""fussy""? Valid English word? Meaning overly concerned?

 So let's see: 
 ""fussy"" has F, U, S, S, Y -> and no R,A,I,E? Correct? So that's an option.

 However, note that we already know that the secret word has an S? And if we guess a word with two S, then we can figure out if there is a second S? Because if the secret word has two S, then both could be marked? 

 But what if the secret word has only one S? Then in ""fussy"", the first S (index 2) would be marked as absent (because there is already one S accounted for at index 3) and the S at index 3 would be ✓? But let me simulate:

 Suppose secret word is ""JOUST"" (which has one S). Guess ""fussy"":
 Position 0: F? not in JOUST -> x
 Position 1: U? JOUST has U? But at position 2? So wrong position? so mark for U: - (wrong position) 
 Position 2: S? But secret word has only one S and it's at position 3? So there is no S at position 2? And we already account for the S? So should be x? 
 Position 3: S? Correct? ✓
 Position 4: Y? JOUST ends with T? So Y not present? -> x

 But according to Wordle rules: since the secret word has one S and it is at position 3, the guess has two S: one at position 2 (which is not present) and one at position 3 (correct). So the S at position 2 would be marked as absent? So F(x), U(-), S(x), S(✓), Y(x) -> FUSSY would show F:x U:? S:x S:✓ Y:x? But note: the first S (at index 2) is marked x because the secret word's S is already accounted for by the position 3? So no extra S.

 However, if the secret word had two S? Then both would be marked. But we don't know.

 So guessing a word with two S might be beneficial? Because we can determine the count.

 But note: our goal is to find the secret word quickly. We only have 6 tries.

 Alternatively, we can guess a word with only the known S and new letters? To maximize letter testing.

 Since we haven't tested many letters: 

 Known absent: R, A, I, E.
 Known present: S (at index 3).

 We need to test O, U, Y? Or consonants? 

 But let me consider: we have to choose a word with S at index 3? So what's better? ""JOUST"" or ""FUSSY""? 

 Both are valid. 

 ""JOUST"" includes J, O, U, S, T -> S at index 3? Actually, wait: 
 J-O-U-S? That's 4 letters? Then T? So J-O-U-S-T: 
 position 0: J -> uncommon?
 position 1: O
 position 2: U
 position 3: S? Actually, the word ""JOUST"" is spelled J-O-U-S-T? I think yes? 

 Actually, in some dictionaries, ""joust"" is acceptable? We can use it.

 Alternatively, ""COSTS"" -> but then we have C-O-S-T-S? 
 position 0: C, 1:O, 2:S -> then position 3:T -> that's not S? So invalid? 

 Another word: ""MUSTY"": M-U-S-T-Y -> 
 M(0), U(1), S(2), T(3), Y(4) -> then S is at index 2? Not index 3.

 ""BUSKS"": B-U-S-K-S -> 
 B(0), U(1), S(2), K(3), S(4) -> index 3 is K? not S.

 So word with S at index 3? Actually, let me list:

 - ""BOUSY"" -> not common.
 - ""CLOUTS"" -> that's 6 letters? wait, 5: C-L-O-U-T-S? -> position 3 would be U? no, indexing: 
   C at 0, L at 1, O at 2, U at 3, T at 4 -> then the last letter? Wait, 5 letters: CLOUT (if no S) -> but ""CLOUTS"" is 6? 

 I found: ""BOOSTS"" -> 6 letters? 

 Actually, ""FUSSY"" is good: F-U-S-S-Y -> it has two S? So index 3 is the second S? But still index 3 is S? Yes? 

 Alternatively, ""MANUS"" -> M-A-N-U-S? But A is forbidden? 

 Another: ""FOCUS"" -> F-O-C-U-S -> index 3 is U? not S? Because F(0), O(1), C(2), U(3), S(4) -> so index 3 is U and index 4 is S? 

 But we need index 3 to be S? 

 How about ""FRASS"" -> F-R-A-S-S? But R and A forbidden? 

 So ""YOUTH"" doesn't have S? 

 I think ""JOUST"" is acceptable? Or ""TOUSY""? ""TOUSY"" is an adjective meaning disorderly? T-O-U-S-Y? 
 T(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), Y(4)? 

 Yes! And it doesn't have R,A,I,E? If we believe that ""tousy"" is a valid word? It might be in some dictionaries? But let's try a more common one.

 Alternatively, ""LOUSY"": L-O-U-S-Y? 
 L(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), Y(4) -> yes! 
 And L, O, U, S, Y -> no R,A,I,E? 
 The word ""lousy"" means extremely disgusting? But commonly used? 

 So I choose ""LOUSY"" because it's more common? 

 But note: we are using S at the position we need? And we get to test L, O, U, Y? 

 So let's plan:

 We guess ""LOUSY"": L-O-U-S-Y

 What happens if the secret word has O, U, Y? And S? 

 But also, if the secret word is ""JOUST"", then with ""LOUSY"":
 L: absent? because JOUST: J,O,U,S,T -> L is absent? Then L(x), O(✓) because at position 1? Actually, JOUST has O at position 1? So same? 
 Position 0: L? not in JOUST? -> x
 Position 1: O? in JOUST at the same position? -> ✓
 Position 2: U? in JOUST at the same position? -> ✓? Actually, JOUST: O at index1, U at index2? So in LO-USY: L,O,U,S,Y? So O at index1? Correct? U at index2? Correct? Then S at index3? Correct? Y at index4? But JOUST ends with T? So Y absent? 

 So feedback for LOUSY against JOUST: L(x) O(✓) U(✓) S(✓) Y(x)? 

 But if the secret word is ""FUSSY"", then:
 Position 0: L? vs FUSSY: F? -> L absent? -> x
 Position 1: O? FUSSY: U at index1? So no O? -> x? 
 Position 2: U? FUSSY has U at index1? So at index2? wrong? Then mark U as present but wrong position? -> -
 Position 3: S? Correct? ✓
 Position 4: Y? FUSSY ends in Y? So correct? ✓

 So we can distinguish? 

 But regardless, we are gathering information.

 We also have other words? 

 Another word: ""MUSSY"": meaning messy? M-U-S-S-Y? 
 M(0), U(1), S(2), S(3), Y(4)? 
 Then S is at index3? So M-U-S-S-Y? Then index3 is S? And no R,A,I,E.

 That's also valid? 

 However, I think ""LOUSY"" is fine? Or even ""TOUSY""? 

 Let me choose ""LOUSY"" because it has two vowels? 

 Also, note: the consonants we haven't tested: T, N, D, etc.

 Alternatively, ""YOUNG"" has no S? 

 Since we must fix S at position 3? We don't have much choice? 

 So I'll go with ""lousy"".

 But wait: let's check: ""lousy"" has S at position 3? Yes: L O U S Y -> positions: 
 0:L
 1:O
 2:U
 3:S 
 4:Y

 So yes.

 Therefore, I choose ""LOUSY"".

 Response: <guess>lousy</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":  
- **R, A, I, E** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").  
- **S** is **present and in the correct position** (marked ""✓"" at index 3, the 4th letter).  

### Key Constraints for Next Guess:  
1. The word must have **S at position 3 (index 3)**.  
2. The word **cannot contain R, A, I, or E**.  
3. New letters should be tested to reveal more about the secret word, prioritizing common vowels (like O, U) and consonants.  

### Selected Guess: ""LOUSY""  
- **Why?**  
  - Satisfies S at index 3: `L O U S Y` → `? ? ? ? ?` → `S` is in position 3.  
  - Uses **L, O, U, Y** → Tests two vowels (O, U) and two consonants (L, Y), all new and not excluded.  
  - ""LOUSY"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning inferior or unsatisfactory).  
  - Maximizes letter coverage: Since R, A, I, E are out, this guess efficiently probes other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

<guess>lousy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: lousy -> FEEDBACK: L(-) O(-) U(x) S(✓) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise"" -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
This means:
- R, A, I, E are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, index 3).

Guess 2: ""lousy"" -> L(-) O(-) U(x) S(✓) Y(x)
This means:
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with '-')
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (marked with '-')
- U is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, index 3) — we already knew this.
- Y is not in the word (x)

So now we know:

1. The secret word has S at position 3 (index 3).
2. The secret word contains L and O, but not at the positions they were in ""lousy"":
   - In ""lousy"", L was at index 0, so L is not at index 0 in the secret word.
   - In ""lousy"", O was at index 1, so O is not at index 1 in the secret word.
3. The secret word does not contain: R, A, I, E, U, Y.

Also, from the first guess, we know the word does not have R, A, I, E.

So absent letters: R, A, I, E, U, Y.

Present letters (besides S): L and O.

We also know the positions for L and O are not at index 0 and 1 respectively.

Now, the secret word has:
- Position 3 (index 3) is S.
- It has L and O, but not at index 0 (for L) and not at index 1 (for O).

We need to form a new guess that:
- Has S at index 3.
- Includes L and O (to confirm their positions? Actually, we already know they are present, so we can try to place them in new positions to find the correct one).
- Avoids R, A, I, E, U, Y.

Also, we should try to test new letters to narrow down possibilities.

What letters are left? We have used: R, A, I, S, E, L, O, U, Y.

So available consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

Vowels: We have used A, E, I, O, U, Y. So the only vowel left? Actually, we have O already (which is present) and no other vowels? But note: sometimes Y is a vowel, but we know Y is absent. So the only vowel we have is O? But we might have words without vowels? Unlikely. So probably O is the only vowel in the word? Or maybe there are no other vowels? But we have L and O? So the word has at least O as a vowel.

But note: we don't know if there are other vowels? We haven't tested all. We have only tested A, E, I, O, U, Y. So the only vowel left? Actually, that's all the vowels? Unless we consider W as a vowel in some words? But typically, we have A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y. So we have tested all? So the secret word must have O (since we know O is present) and possibly no other vowels? But it could have a Y? But we know Y is absent? So only O is the vowel? And consonants.

So the word has: O, L, S (at position 3), and two other letters from the available set.

Now, for the next guess, we want to place L and O in positions that are not 0 and 1 (since we know they are not there) and also not position 3 (because that is S). So available positions: 0,1,2,4? But note: we have to assign L and O to two of these positions? And we have two more letters to choose.

But we don't know the correct positions for L and O. So we should try to put them in positions we haven't tried? And also test new letters.

We know L cannot be at index 0? And O cannot be at index 1? But they could be at other positions.

Possible positions for L: 1,2,4 (since 0 is forbidden and 3 is S).
Possible positions for O: 0,2,4 (since 1 is forbidden and 3 is S).

We also need to test new letters? So we should choose a word that has:
- S at index 3.
- L and O in the word, but at positions that are not their forbidden ones? And we want to try to put them in positions that might be correct? Or to get more information.

Alternatively, we can try to fix one of them? But we don't know.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern and constraints.

The word pattern: _ _ _ S _ 

We know the word has L and O? And S at index 3? And no R,A,I,E,U,Y.

So the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3] S [letter5]

Where:
- letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5 are from the available set: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Z and O and L? But note: O and L must appear somewhere? So two of these positions must be O and L? And the other two are new letters.

But we have to assign O and L to two of the four positions? But note: the positions for O and L have constraints: L cannot be at position 0? O cannot be at position 1? So:

- Position 0: cannot be L? So it must be either O or a new letter? But O can be at position 0? Because we haven't tried O at 0? Only at 1? So O can be at 0? 
- Position 1: cannot be O? So it must be L or a new letter? But L can be at position 1? Because we only know L is not at 0? So L can be at 1? 
- Position 2: can be O or L or new.
- Position 4: can be O or L or new.

But we must have both O and L in the word? So two of these positions must be O and L? And the other two positions must be new letters? Actually, we have four positions to fill? And we have two letters that must be included (O and L)? So we need to choose two more letters? And assign all.

So the word has five letters: 
- Position 0: not L? 
- Position 1: not O?
- Position 3: S
- The word must contain O and L.

Now, let's try to form such a word.

We can try to put O at position 0? Then position 1 must be not O? So that's okay? Then we can put L at position 2? Then position 4 is a new letter? And position 1 must be a new letter? 

Example: O _ L S _ 

So pattern: O ? L S ?

We need to fill the two blanks? With letters from available set? And the word must be valid.

What words? 
- ""OILSS"" -> but I is absent? and duplicate S? 
- We cannot use I? 

Available letters: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Z.

Try: ""COLTS"" -> C O L T S? 
But then: 
Position 0: C
Position 1: O -> but wait, we put O at position 0? In this pattern we are trying O at 0? But in ""COLTS"", O is at position 1? That doesn't match.

We are trying pattern: O at 0, then position 1 is ?, position 2 is L, position 3 is S, position 4 is ?

So: O ? L S ?

What words? 
- ""OFLS?"" -> not a word.
- ""OMLST"" -> not a word.

How about ""OLLAS""? But has A? absent? and duplicate L? 

Not many words? 

Alternatively, put O at position 2? Then L at position 1? But position 1 cannot be O? But it can be L? 

Pattern: _ L O S _ 

But position 1: L? That's allowed? Because we only know L is not at 0? So L at 1 is okay? 

Then pattern: ? L O S ?

Words: 
- ""BLOST"" -> B L O S T? 
  - Check: B(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), T(4) -> S at 3? yes.
  - Letters: B, L, O, S, T -> no R,A,I,E,U,Y? 
  - Is ""BLOST"" a word? I think not? 

- ""CLOPS"": C L O P S? 
  - C(0), L(1), O(2), P(3)? But wait, position 3 must be S? So P at 3? Then S at 4? But we need S at 3? So no.

Pattern: ? L O S ? -> so position 0: ?, position1: L, position2: O, position3: S, position4: ?

So the word must have S at position 3? So the fourth letter is S? Then the fifth letter is the last.

So the word is: [letter0] L O S [letter4]

So the word ends with ""LOS"" + letter? Actually, the word is: [0] + L + O + S + [4]? 

So the word is like ?LOS?

Examples: 
- ""CLOSE"" -> but E is absent? 
- ""BLOBS"" -> B L O B S? Then position 3 is B? not S? 
- ""BLOGS"" -> B L O G S? 
  - Position 0: B
  - Position 1: L
  - Position 2: O
  - Position 3: G? -> but we need S at 3? So no.

Wait, in this pattern, position 3 is the fourth character? So the word: 
character0: ?
character1: L
character2: O
character3: S? -> but we are putting S at position 3? Then the word is ...? 

But in the pattern, we have fixed position 3 as S? So the word is: [0] [1] [2] S [4]? 

But in the above, we are trying to put L at 1 and O at 2? So: 
[0] L O S [4]

So the word is: X L O S Y? But Y is absent? 

What words have the form ?LOS? and the last letter is not Y? 

- ""CLOST"" -> not a word.
- ""GLOST"" -> not common? 
- ""FLOSS"" -> F L O S S? 
  - Then: F(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), S(4) -> so position 3 is S? Yes? 
  - But we have two S? That's okay? 
  - And letters: F, L, O, S, S -> no R,A,I,E,U,Y? 
  - ""Floss"" is a valid word? Yes.

But note: we already know S is present? And we are testing if there is a second S? 

So ""FLOSS"" is a candidate.

But we also have the constraint that L cannot be at index 0? But in ""FLOSS"", L is at index 1? Which is allowed? And O is at index 2? Which is allowed? 

So let's consider ""FLOSS"".

Alternatively, put O at position 0? Then we have pattern: O ? ? S ? 

And we need to include L? So L must be at one of the positions: 1,2,4? 

But position 1 cannot be O? But we have O at 0? So position 1 can be L? 

Pattern: O L ? S ? 

Then: O L ? S ? 

Words: 
- ""OLPUS"" -> not a word? 
- ""OLDS?"" -> but D is available? ""OLDS"" is 4 letters? 
- ""OLDs"" -> but we need 5: O L D S ? -> then we need a fifth letter? 
  - ""OLDS"" is 4, so not.

- ""OLPES"" -> E absent? 

Not many.

Put O at position 4? Then we have pattern: ? ? ? S O 

And we need to include L? So L must be at 0,1,2? But L cannot be at 0? So L at 1 or 2? 

Pattern: ? L ? S O  OR ? ? L S O 

First: ? L ? S O 
- ""BLPSO"" -> not a word.
- ""CLASO"" -> A absent? 
- ""FLTSO"" -> not a word.

Second: ? ? L S O 
- ""COLSO"" -> not common? 
- ""TULSO"" -> U absent? 
- ""PULSO"" -> U absent? 

Not many.

Put L at position 4? Then we have pattern: ? ? ? S L 

And O must be at 0,1,2? But O cannot be at 1? So O at 0 or 2? 

Pattern: O ? ? S L  OR ? O ? S L 

First: O ? ? S L 
- ""O M P S L"" -> not a word.

Second: ? O ? S L 
- ""B O P S L"" -> not a word.
- ""T O M S L"" -> not a word.

So it seems ""FLOSS"" is a good candidate? 

But let's see if there are other words.

Another idea: put L at position 2? and O at position 4? Then pattern: ? ? L S O 

Words: 
- ""??LSO"" 
- ""PULSO"" -> U absent? 
- ""MOLSO"" -> M O L S O? 
  - M(0), O(1), L(2), S(3), O(4) -> but O at position 1? which is forbidden? Because we know O is not at index 1? 

In ""MOLSO"", O is at index 1? So that's not allowed? 

- ""COLSO"" -> C O L S O? O at index 1? forbidden.

- ""HOLMS"" -> H O L M S? 
  - H(0), O(1), L(2), M(3), S(4) -> but position 3 is M? not S? We need S at index 3? 

So not.

Another pattern: put L at position 1? and O at position 4? Then: ? L ? S O 

Words: 
- ""B L I S O"" -> I absent? 
- ""B L A S O"" -> A absent? 
- ""C L O S O"" -> O at position 2? and O at 4? 
  - C(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), O(4) -> S at 3? yes? 
  - But O at position 2? which is allowed? 
  - ""CLOSO"" is not a common word? 

- ""FLOSO"" -> F L O S O? 
  - F(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), O(4) -> S at 3? 
  - But is ""floso"" a word? I don't think so.

So ""FLOSS"" seems the best so far? 

But note: in ""FLOSS"", we have:
- F at 0 (new)
- L at 1 (we know L is present, but we are trying it at position 1? which is allowed? because we only know L is not at 0? so it could be at 1? 
- O at 2 (we know O is present, and we are trying at 2? which is allowed? because we only know O is not at 1? so 2 is okay)
- S at 3 (correct)
- S at 4 (new, but we are testing if there is a second S)

So if we guess ""FLOSS"", we can get information about F and the second S? 

But also, if the secret word does not have F, then we know? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have duplicate S? And tests more new letters? 

For example, put L at position 4? and O at position 0? Then pattern: O ? ? S L 

Words: 
- ""O C T S L"" -> not a word.
- ""O M N S L"" -> not a word.

Not working.

Put O at position 0 and L at position 2? Pattern: O ? L S ? 

Words: 
- ""O F L S ?"" -> ""OFLS"" and then? 
- ""OFLES"" -> E absent? 
- ""OILSS"" -> I absent? 
- ""OWLSS"" -> W is available? ""OWLSS"" is not a word? 

""OWLS"" is 4 letters? 

How about ""OLLAS"" -> A absent? 

Not working.

Another idea: put L at position 2 and O at position 0? Same as above.

Or put L at position 4 and O at position 2? Pattern: ? ? O S L 

Words: 
- ""B C O S L"" -> not a word.
- ""S C O S L"" -> S at 0? but we are not sure? 
- ""T O O S L"" -> T O O S L? 
  - T(0), O(1), O(2), S(3), L(4) -> but O at position 1? which is forbidden? 

So not.

After trying, ""FLOSS"" seems a valid word that fits? 

But let me check if there are other words? 

What about ""CLOTS"": C L O T S? 
- C(0), L(1), O(2), T(3), S(4) -> but position 3 is T? not S? We need S at 3? 

Not.

""BOLTS"": B O L T S? 
- B(0), O(1), L(2), T(3), S(4) -> position 3 is T? not S? 

Not.

""POLES"": E absent? 

""DOLLS"": D O L L S? 
- D(0), O(1), L(2), L(3), S(4) -> position 3 is L? not S? 

Not.

""FLOWS"": F L O W S? 
- F(0), L(1), O(2), W(3), S(4) -> position 3 is W? not S? 

Not.

""GLOSS"": G L O S S? 
- G(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), S(4) -> this is similar to ""FLOSS"", but with G? 

""GLOSS"" is a word? Yes, meaning shine? 

And it has S at position 3? 

And letters: G, L, O, S, S -> no R,A,I,E,U,Y? 

So ""GLOSS"" is also a candidate? 

Similarly, ""SLOSH"": S L O S H? 
- S(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), H(4) -> but position 0 is S? but we don't know if S is at 0? But we know there is an S at 3? and if there is another S? 
- But also, in ""SLOSH"", we have S at 0 and S at 3? 
- But we are allowed? 
- However, we know L is present? and O? 
- But in ""SLOSH"", L is at 1? O at 2? 
- But we also have S at 0? which we don't know if it is present? 

But note: we know the secret word has S at position 3? But it might have another S? 

But in ""SLOSH"", we are putting S at 0? which is a new position? 

But also, we are testing H? 

But the problem: we know L cannot be at 0? and in ""SLOSH"", L is at 1? which is allowed? O at 2? allowed? 

But is ""SLOSH"" valid? Yes? 

But we have to avoid using absent letters? H is not used? 

But let's compare to ""FLOSS"" and ""GLOSS"". 

We can choose any? 

But we want to test new letters? 

In ""FLOSS"", we test F? 
In ""GLOSS"", we test G? 
In ""SLOSH"", we test S at 0 and H? 

But we already know S is present? But we don't know if there is a second S? 

But in ""SLOSH"", we are testing S at 0? which might be present? 

But we have limited guesses? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have duplicate S? To avoid confusion? 

For example, if we can find a word with L and O and S at 3? and two new letters? without duplicate S? 

But earlier attempts failed? 

What about ""LOVES"": E absent? 

""LOOPS"": L O O P S? 
- L(0), O(1), O(2), P(3), S(4) -> position 3 is P? not S? 

Not.

""TOILS"": I absent? 

""COILS"": I absent? 

""POLLS"": P O L L S? 
- P(0), O(1), L(2), L(3), S(4) -> position 3 is L? not S? 

Not.

""BOWLS"": B O W L S? 
- B(0), O(1), W(2), L(3), S(4) -> position 3 is L? not S? 

Not.

""MOLLS"": M O L L S? 
- M(0), O(1), L(2), L(3), S(4) -> position 3 is L? not S? 

Not.

""FOLLY"": Y absent? 

So it seems words with S at position 3 and containing L and O are rare? 

""FLOSS"" and ""GLOSS"" are valid? 

Another one: ""SLOWS"": S L O W S? 
- S(0), L(1), O(2), W(3), S(4) -> position 3 is W? not S? 

Not.

""BLESS"": E absent? 

So I think ""FLOSS"" or ""GLOSS"" are the best? 

Let me choose ""GLOSS"" because G is a common letter? 

But we can also consider ""CLOPS"" but that doesn't have S at 3? 

Another word: ""PLOTS"": P L O T S? 
- P(0), L(1), O(2), T(3), S(4) -> position 3 is T? not S? 

Not.

So I think we have to go with ""FLOSS"" or ""GLOSS"" or ""SLOSH"". 

But ""SLOSH"" has S at 0? which might be a problem? Because if the secret word does not have S at 0, then we get feedback that S at 0 is not present? But we already know S is at 3? So if we get an 'x' for S at 0, that means there is no other S? 

Similarly, in ""FLOSS"", we have S at 4? which is a new position? 

But in ""FLOSS"", we are testing F and the second S? 

Similarly, in ""GLOSS"", we test G and the second S? 

In ""SLOSH"", we test S at 0 and H? 

But we know S is at 3? So if we guess ""SLOSH"", and the secret word has only one S, then the S at 0 will be marked as absent? 

But we want to avoid using S again? But it's okay? 

But let's see the feedback we can get? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have duplicate S? 

What about ""POLKS"": P O L K S? 
- P(0), O(1), L(2), K(3), S(4) -> position 3 is K? not S? 

Not.

""VOLKS"" -> not a word? 

I think we have to accept a word with duplicate S? 

Let me choose ""GLOSS"" as it is a common word? 

But we also have the constraint that in the previous guess ""lousy"", we had L at 0 and O at 1? and now we are trying L at 1 and O at 2? 

So for ""GLOSS"": 
- G at 0: new letter? 
- L at 1: we know L is present, and we are trying position 1? 
- O at 2: we know O is present, and we are trying position 2? 
- S at 3: known
- S at 4: testing if there is a second S? 

If the secret word is, for example, ""CLOPS"" is not possible? 

What could the secret word be? 

We know: 
- S at 3
- L and O present, not at 0 and 1 respectively? 
- No R,A,I,E,U,Y.

Possible words: 
- ""FLOSS"" 
- ""GLOSS""
- ""SLOSH"" (if we consider it)
- ""BLOSS"" -> not a word? 
- ""CLOSH"" -> not common? 

Or ""POLOS"": P O L O S? 
- P(0), O(1), L(2), O(3), S(4) -> position 3 is O? not S? 

Not.

""DOGES"": E absent? 

So very few possibilities? 

Another one: ""LOFTS"": L O F T S? 
- L(0), O(1), F(2), T(3), S(4) -> position 3 is T? not S? 

Not.

So I think ""FLOSS"" and ""GLOSS"" are the main candidates? 

Let me choose ""GLOSS"". 

But we can also consider ""CLOTH"": but H is available? and T? 
- C L O T H? 
- But position 3 must be S? 

Not.

So I'll go with ""GLOSS"". 

But let's confirm the feedback we might get? 

If the secret word is ""FLOSS"", then for ""GLOSS"":
- G: not in FLOSS? -> x
- L: in FLOSS at position 1? -> but in GLOSS, L is at position 1? and in FLOSS, L is at position 1? so correct? ✓
- O: in FLOSS at position 2? and in GLOSS at position 2? so ✓
- S: at position 3? ✓
- S: at position 4? in FLOSS, there is S at 4? so ✓? 

But FLOSS has two S? So both S are present? 

But in feedback, for the second S at position 4? it would be ✓? 

So feedback: G(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(✓) -> but that would be 4 ✓? 

But the secret word is ""FLOSS"", so the first letter is F, not G? So G is wrong? 

But we get three ✓ for L,O,S? and the last S is also ✓? 

But the word is not guessed? 

Alternatively, if the secret word is ""SLOSH"", then for ""GLOSS"":
- G: not in SLOSH? -> x
- L: in SLOSH at position 1? and we have L at 1? so ✓
- O: in SLOSH at position 2? and we have O at 2? so ✓
- S: at 3? ✓
- S: at 4? but SLOSH has H at 4? so S at 4 is not present? and also, SLOSH has only one S? at position 3? so the S at 4 is extra? -> x

So feedback: G(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(x)

Then we know the last letter is not S? 

But we would know the secret word has S only at 3? 

But in this case, we have to guess again? 

But we are on guess 3? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has no duplicate letters? 

But we couldn't find one? 

Another word: ""BROWS"": R absent? 

Not.

"" CROWS"": R absent? 

Not.

""PROWL"": no S? 

I think we have to go with ""GLOSS"" or ""FLOSS"". 

Let me choose ""GLOSS"". 

But we can also try ""CLOMP"": no S? 

Not.

So I'll go with ""GLOSS"". 

But note: in ""GLOSS"", we are putting O at position 2? which is allowed? and L at position 1? allowed? 

So guess: ""GLOSS""

Response: <guess>gloss</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""raise"" → Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(✓), E(x)**  
   - **S** is in the secret word and **correctly positioned at index 3** (4th letter).  
   - **R, A, I, E** are **absent** from the secret word.  

2. **Guess 2: ""lousy"" → Feedback: L(-), O(-), U(x), S(✓), Y(x)**  
   - **S** is again confirmed at index 3 (✓).  
   - **L and O** are **present** but in **wrong positions**:  
     - L cannot be at index 0.  
     - O cannot be at index 1.  
   - **U and Y** are **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed Letters**:  
  - **S** is fixed at **position 3** (index 3).  
  - **L and O** are in the word but **not** at positions 0 or 1, respectively.  
- **Absent Letters**: R, A, I, E, U, Y.  
- **Possible Positions for L and O**:  
  - L can be at indices **1, 2, or 4** (since index 0 is invalid).  
  - O can be at indices **0, 2, or 4** (since index 1 is invalid).  
- **Untested Letters**: Focus on common consonants (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, T) and the known vowels (only O remains).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must include S at index 3** and **both L and O** to test new positions.  
- **Avoid absent letters** (R, A, I, E, U, Y).  
- **Test new consonants** to maximize information (e.g., G, L, O, S).  
- **Optimal Word Choice**: ""GLOSS"" fits perfectly:  
  - **G** at index 0 (tests a new consonant).  
  - **L** at index 1 (tests a valid position for L).  
  - **O** at index 2 (tests a valid position for O).  
  - **S** at index 3 (confirmed position).  
  - **S** at index 4 (tests for a potential second ""S"").  
- ""GLOSS"" is a valid English word (meaning ""shine"" or ""luster""), adhering to all constraints.  

### Expected Outcomes:
- If **G** is absent, it will be eliminated.  
- Positions of **L (index 1)** and **O (index 2)** will be validated.  
- The second **S (index 4)** tests for duplicates.

Wait, the symbol is \'✓\' meaning correct position? But in the example, ✓ means correct position.\n\n However, looking back at the rules: ✓ means the letter is in the word and in the correct position.\n\n But note: in the feedback for ""raise"", we have S(✓) meaning that S is in the secret word and it is at the same position as in ""raise"", that is, the fourth position (index 3, counting from 0?).\n\n Also, note that R, A, I, E are all absent.\n\n Therefore, we know:\n - The letter S is present and is the fourth letter of the secret word (so the word ends with ...S? Actually, no, it\'s the fourth letter, meaning position 3?).\n\n But note: the word is 5 letters. So positions: 0,1,2,3,4.\n Since ""raise"" was R-A-I-S-E, the S is at position 3.\n\n Therefore, the secret word has S as its fourth letter (position 3).\n\n And R, A, I, E are absent.\n\n So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, E. Also, it does contain S at position 3.\n\n Since E is absent, common vowels A, E, I are out. So the secret word must have other vowels? Or it might not? English words must have vowels, so likely vowels: O, U, sometimes Y (if allowed, but typically Wordle uses common words so Y might be allowed).\n\n However, we are not told that Y is always allowed? But the rules say ""valid 5-letter English word"". So let\'s consider O, U, and Y (if it\'s a vowel).\n\n Now, for the next guess:\n - We must have a word that has S at position 3 (index 3) because we know S is fixed at that position? But note: we don\'t know the positions of other letters, but S can\'t be moved? Actually, we can try words that have S at position 3 to get more feedback.\n\n However, we also know that the word cannot contain R, A, I, E.\n\n So, when constructing the next word:\n - Must be a 5-letter English word.\n - Must have S at the 4th position (index 3).\n - Must not use R, A, I, E.\n\n What letters are left? Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Note O and U are vowels.\n\n Since we don\'t have many vowels left, we might want to include O or U to see if they are in the word.\n\n Also, note that S is the only letter we know so far.\n\n Let\'s think of words that satisfy:\n - Position 3 (the fourth character) must be S.\n - The other letters: no R, A, I, E.\n\n Some options:\n\n Option 1: Try words with O and U? Or common consonants?\n\n Example: ""FOCUS"" -> F at 0, O at 1, C at 2, U at 4? But wait, position 3 must be S? So ""FOCUS"" doesn\'t have S at position 3? It ends with U-S? Actually, ""FOCUS"" has letters: \n 0: F, 1: O, 2: C, 3: U, 4: S -> but wait, we need the fourth letter (position 3) to be S? In ""FOCUS"", position 3 is U and position 4 is S? That doesn\'t match.\n\n Actually, we need S at position 3 (which is the fourth position in a 5-letter string, since indexing starts at 0: positions 0,1,2,3,4). So S must be at index 3.\n\n Example: ""HOSTS"" -> but has duplicate S? And S at index 3? Let\'s break down: \n H-O-S-T-S? Positions: 0:H, 1:O, 2:S, 3:T, 4:S -> No, the S at index 3 would be T? Actually, no: the word is 5 letters: ""HOSTS"" -> \n H (0), O (1), S (2), T (3), S (4) -> So index 3 is T? Then not S at index 3.\n\n We need a word where the character at index 3 is S.\n\n Examples of words that end with ...S? But note: index 3 is the fourth letter, so the fifth letter can be anything? Actually, the word could be like X X X S X.\n\n For instance: ""BONUS"" -> B (0), O (1), N (2), U (3), S (4) -> index 3 is U? So that\'s not S.\n\n How about ""DENTS"" -> D (0), E (1), N (2), T (3), S (4) -> index 3 is T? No.\n\n Or ""LANTS"" -> L-A-N-T-S? That\'s not a common word.\n\n Actually, let me think: words with the fourth letter S? That would be words ending in \'S\'? Not necessarily, because position 3 is the fourth character? For example: ""CRASS"" -> C-R-A-S-S? Then: \n Index 0: C\n Index 1: R -> but R is forbidden? We know R is absent.\n\n Since R is absent, we can\'t use R.\n\n Another example: ""COSTS"" -> C-O-S-T-S? That\'s C at index 0, O at 1, S at 2, T at 3, S at 4. So index 3 is T? Then not S.\n\n How about ""JUMPS"" -> J-U-M-P-S: \n J(0), U(1), M(2), P(3), S(4) -> index 3 P? Not S.\n\n Actually, we need the letter at index 3 to be S. So the word must end with \'S\'? Only if index 3 is the fourth character and index 4 is fifth, so the word pattern is _ _ _ S _\n\n But wait: the word ends at index 4? So it\'s not necessarily the last letter? Example: ""CHAOS"" -> C-H-A-O-S: \n index 0: C, 1: H, 2: A -> forbidden (A absent), 3: O, 4: S? So index 3 is O.\n\n How about ""FUSSY"": F-U-S-S-Y -> \n F(0), U(1), S(2), S(3), Y(4) -> This has S at index 3? Yes!\n\n However, we also have S at index 2? That\'s duplicate S? But we don\'t know how many S the secret word has. Our feedback only said one S at index 3? Actually, in the first guess, we only had one S and it was correct. But the word could have more S? However, our feedback didn\'t show any other S? But our guess only had one S.\n\n Actually, the word ""raise"" only had one S. So the feedback for S was correct at index 3? That doesn\'t say about duplicate S? Wait: if the secret word had another S at another position? Then in the first guess we didn\'t guess an S at that position? So it wouldn\'t show up? This is tricky.\n\n According to the rules: the feedback for each letter is independent? Actually, no: I recall in Wordle, if there is a duplicate letter, it can be marked only if it appears that many times? But let me recall the exact rule:\n\n Typically: \n - If a letter is in the word and in the correct position, it gets ✓.\n - If a letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets -.\n - But if a letter appears more times in the guess than in the secret word, then the excess will be marked as x.\n\n However, in our feedback for ""raise"", we have R(x), A(x), I(x), S(✓), E(x). Since we didn\'t have any other S, we cannot be sure if there are multiple S? So it\'s possible.\n\n But here, since we know S is at index 3, we must choose a word that has S at index 3? And we are free to choose other letters? We should avoid R, A, I, E.\n\n So for next guess, we want:\n - A word that has S at position 3 (index 3).\n - Does not contain R, A, I, E.\n - And we want to test other common letters? Like consonants? Or vowels O, U, Y.\n\n So let me think of words that fit: pattern _ _ _ S _ (where the fifth character can be anything).\n\n For example:\n - ""PULPS"": P-U-L-P-S -> index 3 is P? no, index 3 would be the fourth letter: so letters 0:P, 1:U, 2:L, 3:P, 4:S -> index 3 is P? Not S.\n\n Correction: the pattern must have the fourth letter (index 3) be S.\n\n How about:\n ""TONUS"" -> T-O-N-U-S? But then index 3 is U? not S.\n\n ""MOUSE"": M-O-U-S-E -> \n M(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), E(4) -> Ah! index 3 is S? Yes. But wait: E is absent? We know E is absent? So we can\'t have E at the end? Because feedback told us E is not in the word? So ""MOUSE"" has E? So it\'s invalid because we know E is absent? And also we don\'t want to use E because it\'s not in the word.\n\n Therefore, we must choose a word that has:\n - S at index 3\n - and no letters from R,A,I,E.\n\n And the fifth letter cannot be E? So we can\'t use words ending in ES? \n\n What are words with S at position 3? Also, without R,A,I,E.\n\n Let me try:\n\n ""JOUST"": J-O-U-S-T -> \n J(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), T(4) -> so index 3 is S? Actually: \n In ""JOUST"", the letters are: \n Position 0: J\n Position 1: O\n Position 2: U\n Position 3: S? \n Wait, no: J-O-U-S-T? That would be 5 letters: J-O-U-S-T -> positions: \n 0:J, 1:O, 2:U, 3:S, 4:T? So index 3 is S? Yes! And T at the end? \n\n This word doesn’t contain R,A,I,E? Let\'s check: J,O,U,S,T -> none of R,A,I,E. \n\n Also, ""joust"" is a valid English word (meaning to engage in combat).\n\n Alternatively, other words? \n ""DOUTS"" -> D-O-U-T-S? but then index 3 is T? S is at the end.\n ""GUSTO"": G-U-S-T-O? Then index 0:G, 1:U, 2:S -> so we have S at index 2? But we need index 3? Then not.\n ""BUSTY"": B-U-S-T-Y -> index 0:B, 1:U, 2:S -> again index 2? Not index 3.\n\n Actually, for S at index 3, the words are much less common? \n\n Another idea: ""FUSSY"" that I thought earlier? F-U-S-S-Y? \n Index 0:F, 1:U, 2:S, 3:S, 4:Y -> so index 3 is S? It has two S? That\'s okay? \n\n And the word ""fussy""? Valid English word? Meaning overly concerned?\n\n So let\'s see: \n ""fussy"" has F, U, S, S, Y -> and no R,A,I,E? Correct? So that\'s an option.\n\n However, note that we already know that the secret word has an S? And if we guess a word with two S, then we can figure out if there is a second S? Because if the secret word has two S, then both could be marked? \n\n But what if the secret word has only one S? Then in ""fussy"", the first S (index 2) would be marked as absent (because there is already one S accounted for at index 3) and the S at index 3 would be ✓? But let me simulate:\n\n Suppose secret word is ""JOUST"" (which has one S). Guess ""fussy"":\n Position 0: F? not in JOUST -> x\n Position 1: U? JOUST has U? But at position 2? So wrong position? so mark for U: - (wrong position) \n Position 2: S? But secret word has only one S and it\'s at position 3? So there is no S at position 2? And we already account for the S? So should be x? \n Position 3: S? Correct? ✓\n Position 4: Y? JOUST ends with T? So Y not present? -> x\n\n But according to Wordle rules: since the secret word has one S and it is at position 3, the guess has two S: one at position 2 (which is not present) and one at position 3 (correct). So the S at position 2 would be marked as absent? So F(x), U(-), S(x), S(✓), Y(x) -> FUSSY would show F:x U:? S:x S:✓ Y:x? But note: the first S (at index 2) is marked x because the secret word\'s S is already accounted for by the position 3? So no extra S.\n\n However, if the secret word had two S? Then both would be marked. But we don\'t know.\n\n So guessing a word with two S might be beneficial? Because we can determine the count.\n\n But note: our goal is to find the secret word quickly. We only have 6 tries.\n\n Alternatively, we can guess a word with only the known S and new letters? To maximize letter testing.\n\n Since we haven\'t tested many letters: \n\n Known absent: R, A, I, E.\n Known present: S (at index 3).\n\n We need to test O, U, Y? Or consonants? \n\n But let me consider: we have to choose a word with S at index 3? So what\'s better? ""JOUST"" or ""FUSSY""? \n\n Both are valid. \n\n ""JOUST"" includes J, O, U, S, T -> S at index 3? Actually, wait: \n J-O-U-S? That\'s 4 letters? Then T? So J-O-U-S-T: \n position 0: J -> uncommon?\n position 1: O\n position 2: U\n position 3: S? Actually, the word ""JOUST"" is spelled J-O-U-S-T? I think yes? \n\n Actually, in some dictionaries, ""joust"" is acceptable? We can use it.\n\n Alternatively, ""COSTS"" -> but then we have C-O-S-T-S? \n position 0: C, 1:O, 2:S -> then position 3:T -> that\'s not S? So invalid? \n\n Another word: ""MUSTY"": M-U-S-T-Y -> \n M(0), U(1), S(2), T(3), Y(4) -> then S is at index 2? Not index 3.\n\n ""BUSKS"": B-U-S-K-S -> \n B(0), U(1), S(2), K(3), S(4) -> index 3 is K? not S.\n\n So word with S at index 3? Actually, let me list:\n\n - ""BOUSY"" -> not common.\n - ""CLOUTS"" -> that\'s 6 letters? wait, 5: C-L-O-U-T-S? -> position 3 would be U? no, indexing: \n   C at 0, L at 1, O at 2, U at 3, T at 4 -> then the last letter? Wait, 5 letters: CLOUT (if no S) -> but ""CLOUTS"" is 6? \n\n I found: ""BOOSTS"" -> 6 letters? \n\n Actually, ""FUSSY"" is good: F-U-S-S-Y -> it has two S? So index 3 is the second S? But still index 3 is S? Yes? \n\n Alternatively, ""MANUS"" -> M-A-N-U-S? But A is forbidden? \n\n Another: ""FOCUS"" -> F-O-C-U-S -> index 3 is U? not S? Because F(0), O(1), C(2), U(3), S(4) -> so index 3 is U and index 4 is S? \n\n But we need index 3 to be S? \n\n How about ""FRASS"" -> F-R-A-S-S? But R and A forbidden? \n\n So ""YOUTH"" doesn\'t have S? \n\n I think ""JOUST"" is acceptable? Or ""TOUSY""? ""TOUSY"" is an adjective meaning disorderly? T-O-U-S-Y? \n T(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), Y(4)? \n\n Yes! And it doesn\'t have R,A,I,E? If we believe that ""tousy"" is a valid word? It might be in some dictionaries? But let\'s try a more common one.\n\n Alternatively, ""LOUSY"": L-O-U-S-Y? \n L(0), O(1), U(2), S(3), Y(4) -> yes! \n And L, O, U, S, Y -> no R,A,I,E? \n The word ""lousy"" means extremely disgusting? But commonly used? \n\n So I choose ""LOUSY"" because it\'s more common? \n\n But note: we are using S at the position we need? And we get to test L, O, U, Y? \n\n So let\'s plan:\n\n We guess ""LOUSY"": L-O-U-S-Y\n\n What happens if the secret word has O, U, Y? And S? \n\n But also, if the secret word is ""JOUST"", then with ""LOUSY"":\n L: absent? because JOUST: J,O,U,S,T -> L is absent? Then L(x), O(✓) because at position 1? Actually, JOUST has O at position 1? So same? \n Position 0: L? not in JOUST? -> x\n Position 1: O? in JOUST at the same position? -> ✓\n Position 2: U? in JOUST at the same position? -> ✓? Actually, JOUST: O at index1, U at index2? So in LO-USY: L,O,U,S,Y? So O at index1? Correct? U at index2? Correct? Then S at index3? Correct? Y at index4? But JOUST ends with T? So Y absent? \n\n So feedback for LOUSY against JOUST: L(x) O(✓) U(✓) S(✓) Y(x)? \n\n But if the secret word is ""FUSSY"", then:\n Position 0: L? vs FUSSY: F? -> L absent? -> x\n Position 1: O? FUSSY: U at index1? So no O? -> x? \n Position 2: U? FUSSY has U at index1? So at index2? wrong? Then mark U as present but wrong position? -> -\n Position 3: S? Correct? ✓\n Position 4: Y? FUSSY ends in Y? So correct? ✓\n\n So we can distinguish? \n\n But regardless, we are gathering information.\n\n We also have other words? \n\n Another word: ""MUSSY"": meaning messy? M-U-S-S-Y? \n M(0), U(1), S(2), S(3), Y(4)? \n Then S is at index3? So M-U-S-S-Y? Then index3 is S? And no R,A,I,E.\n\n That\'s also valid? \n\n However, I think ""LOUSY"" is fine? Or even ""TOUSY""? \n\n Let me choose ""LOUSY"" because it has two vowels? \n\n Also, note: the consonants we haven\'t tested: T, N, D, etc.\n\n Alternatively, ""YOUNG"" has no S? \n\n Since we must fix S at position 3? We don\'t have much choice? \n\n So I\'ll go with ""lousy"".\n\n But wait: let\'s check: ""lousy"" has S at position 3? Yes: L O U S Y -> positions: \n 0:L\n 1:O\n 2:U\n 3:S \n 4:Y\n\n So yes.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""LOUSY"".\n\n Response: <guess>lousy</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":  \n- **R, A, I, E** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").  \n- **S** is **present and in the correct position** (marked ""✓"" at index 3, the 4th letter).  \n\n### Key Constraints for Next Guess:  \n1. The word must have **S at position 3 (index 3)**.  \n2. The word **cannot contain R, A, I, or E**.  \n3. New letters should be tested to reveal more about the secret word, prioritizing common vowels (like O, U) and consonants.  \n\n### Selected Guess: ""LOUSY""  \n- **Why?**  \n  - Satisfies S at index 3: `L O U S Y` → `? ? ? ? ?` → `S` is in position 3.  \n  - Uses **L, O, U, Y** → Tests two vowels (O, U) and two consonants (L, Y), all new and not excluded.  \n  - ""LOUSY"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning inferior or unsatisfactory).  \n  - Maximizes letter coverage: Since R, A, I, E are out, this guess efficiently probes other common letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\n<guess>lousy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: lousy -> FEEDBACK: L(-) O(-) U(x) S(✓) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""raise"" -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nThis means:\n- R, A, I, E are not in the word at all.\n- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, index 3).\n\nGuess 2: ""lousy"" -> L(-) O(-) U(x) S(✓) Y(x)\nThis means:\n- L is in the word but in the wrong position (since it\'s marked with \'-\')\n- O is in the word but in the wrong position (marked with \'-\')\n- U is not in the word (x)\n- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, index 3) — we already knew this.\n- Y is not in the word (x)\n\nSo now we know:\n\n1. The secret word has S at position 3 (index 3).\n2. The secret word contains L and O, but not at the positions they were in ""lousy"":\n   - In ""lousy"", L was at index 0, so L is not at index 0 in the secret word.\n   - In ""lousy"", O was at index 1, so O is not at index 1 in the secret word.\n3. The secret word does not contain: R, A, I, E, U, Y.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know the word does not have R, A, I, E.\n\nSo absent letters: R, A, I, E, U, Y.\n\nPresent letters (besides S): L and O.\n\nWe also know the positions for L and O are not at index 0 and 1 respectively.\n\nNow, the secret word has:\n- Position 3 (index 3) is S.\n- It has L and O, but not at index 0 (for L) and not at index 1 (for O).\n\nWe need to form a new guess that:\n- Has S at index 3.\n- Includes L and O (to confirm their positions? Actually, we already know they are present, so we can try to place them in new positions to find the correct one).\n- Avoids R, A, I, E, U, Y.\n\nAlso, we should try to test new letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\nWhat letters are left? We have used: R, A, I, S, E, L, O, U, Y.\n\nSo available consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.\n\nVowels: We have used A, E, I, O, U, Y. So the only vowel left? Actually, we have O already (which is present) and no other vowels? But note: sometimes Y is a vowel, but we know Y is absent. So the only vowel we have is O? But we might have words without vowels? Unlikely. So probably O is the only vowel in the word? Or maybe there are no other vowels? But we have L and O? So the word has at least O as a vowel.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if there are other vowels? We haven\'t tested all. We have only tested A, E, I, O, U, Y. So the only vowel left? Actually, that\'s all the vowels? Unless we consider W as a vowel in some words? But typically, we have A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y. So we have tested all? So the secret word must have O (since we know O is present) and possibly no other vowels? But it could have a Y? But we know Y is absent? So only O is the vowel? And consonants.\n\nSo the word has: O, L, S (at position 3), and two other letters from the available set.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we want to place L and O in positions that are not 0 and 1 (since we know they are not there) and also not position 3 (because that is S). So available positions: 0,1,2,4? But note: we have to assign L and O to two of these positions? And we have two more letters to choose.\n\nBut we don\'t know the correct positions for L and O. So we should try to put them in positions we haven\'t tried? And also test new letters.\n\nWe know L cannot be at index 0? And O cannot be at index 1? But they could be at other positions.\n\nPossible positions for L: 1,2,4 (since 0 is forbidden and 3 is S).\nPossible positions for O: 0,2,4 (since 1 is forbidden and 3 is S).\n\nWe also need to test new letters? So we should choose a word that has:\n- S at index 3.\n- L and O in the word, but at positions that are not their forbidden ones? And we want to try to put them in positions that might be correct? Or to get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to fix one of them? But we don\'t know.\n\nLet me think of words that fit the pattern and constraints.\n\nThe word pattern: _ _ _ S _ \n\nWe know the word has L and O? And S at index 3? And no R,A,I,E,U,Y.\n\nSo the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3] S [letter5]\n\nWhere:\n- letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5 are from the available set: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Z and O and L? But note: O and L must appear somewhere? So two of these positions must be O and L? And the other two are new letters.\n\nBut we have to assign O and L to two of the four positions? But note: the positions for O and L have constraints: L cannot be at position 0? O cannot be at position 1? So:\n\n- Position 0: cannot be L? So it must be either O or a new letter? But O can be at position 0? Because we haven\'t tried O at 0? Only at 1? So O can be at 0? \n- Position 1: cannot be O? So it must be L or a new letter? But L can be at position 1? Because we only know L is not at 0? So L can be at 1? \n- Position 2: can be O or L or new.\n- Position 4: can be O or L or new.\n\nBut we must have both O and L in the word? So two of these positions must be O and L? And the other two positions must be new letters? Actually, we have four positions to fill? And we have two letters that must be included (O and L)? So we need to choose two more letters? And assign all.\n\nSo the word has five letters: \n- Position 0: not L? \n- Position 1: not O?\n- Position 3: S\n- The word must contain O and L.\n\nNow, let\'s try to form such a word.\n\nWe can try to put O at position 0? Then position 1 must be not O? So that\'s okay? Then we can put L at position 2? Then position 4 is a new letter? And position 1 must be a new letter? \n\nExample: O _ L S _ \n\nSo pattern: O ? L S ?\n\nWe need to fill the two blanks? With letters from available set? And the word must be valid.\n\nWhat words? \n- ""OILSS"" -> but I is absent? and duplicate S? \n- We cannot use I? \n\nAvailable letters: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Z.\n\nTry: ""COLTS"" -> C O L T S? \nBut then: \nPosition 0: C\nPosition 1: O -> but wait, we put O at position 0? In this pattern we are trying O at 0? But in ""COLTS"", O is at position 1? That doesn\'t match.\n\nWe are trying pattern: O at 0, then position 1 is ?, position 2 is L, position 3 is S, position 4 is ?\n\nSo: O ? L S ?\n\nWhat words? \n- ""OFLS?"" -> not a word.\n- ""OMLST"" -> not a word.\n\nHow about ""OLLAS""? But has A? absent? and duplicate L? \n\nNot many words? \n\nAlternatively, put O at position 2? Then L at position 1? But position 1 cannot be O? But it can be L? \n\nPattern: _ L O S _ \n\nBut position 1: L? That\'s allowed? Because we only know L is not at 0? So L at 1 is okay? \n\nThen pattern: ? L O S ?\n\nWords: \n- ""BLOST"" -> B L O S T? \n  - Check: B(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), T(4) -> S at 3? yes.\n  - Letters: B, L, O, S, T -> no R,A,I,E,U,Y? \n  - Is ""BLOST"" a word? I think not? \n\n- ""CLOPS"": C L O P S? \n  - C(0), L(1), O(2), P(3)? But wait, position 3 must be S? So P at 3? Then S at 4? But we need S at 3? So no.\n\nPattern: ? L O S ? -> so position 0: ?, position1: L, position2: O, position3: S, position4: ?\n\nSo the word must have S at position 3? So the fourth letter is S? Then the fifth letter is the last.\n\nSo the word is: [letter0] L O S [letter4]\n\nSo the word ends with ""LOS"" + letter? Actually, the word is: [0] + L + O + S + [4]? \n\nSo the word is like ?LOS?\n\nExamples: \n- ""CLOSE"" -> but E is absent? \n- ""BLOBS"" -> B L O B S? Then position 3 is B? not S? \n- ""BLOGS"" -> B L O G S? \n  - Position 0: B\n  - Position 1: L\n  - Position 2: O\n  - Position 3: G? -> but we need S at 3? So no.\n\nWait, in this pattern, position 3 is the fourth character? So the word: \ncharacter0: ?\ncharacter1: L\ncharacter2: O\ncharacter3: S? -> but we are putting S at position 3? Then the word is ...? \n\nBut in the pattern, we have fixed position 3 as S? So the word is: [0] [1] [2] S [4]? \n\nBut in the above, we are trying to put L at 1 and O at 2? So: \n[0] L O S [4]\n\nSo the word is: X L O S Y? But Y is absent? \n\nWhat words have the form ?LOS? and the last letter is not Y? \n\n- ""CLOST"" -> not a word.\n- ""GLOST"" -> not common? \n- ""FLOSS"" -> F L O S S? \n  - Then: F(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), S(4) -> so position 3 is S? Yes? \n  - But we have two S? That\'s okay? \n  - And letters: F, L, O, S, S -> no R,A,I,E,U,Y? \n  - ""Floss"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut note: we already know S is present? And we are testing if there is a second S? \n\nSo ""FLOSS"" is a candidate.\n\nBut we also have the constraint that L cannot be at index 0? But in ""FLOSS"", L is at index 1? Which is allowed? And O is at index 2? Which is allowed? \n\nSo let\'s consider ""FLOSS"".\n\nAlternatively, put O at position 0? Then we have pattern: O ? ? S ? \n\nAnd we need to include L? So L must be at one of the positions: 1,2,4? \n\nBut position 1 cannot be O? But we have O at 0? So position 1 can be L? \n\nPattern: O L ? S ? \n\nThen: O L ? S ? \n\nWords: \n- ""OLPUS"" -> not a word? \n- ""OLDS?"" -> but D is available? ""OLDS"" is 4 letters? \n- ""OLDs"" -> but we need 5: O L D S ? -> then we need a fifth letter? \n  - ""OLDS"" is 4, so not.\n\n- ""OLPES"" -> E absent? \n\nNot many.\n\nPut O at position 4? Then we have pattern: ? ? ? S O \n\nAnd we need to include L? So L must be at 0,1,2? But L cannot be at 0? So L at 1 or 2? \n\nPattern: ? L ? S O  OR ? ? L S O \n\nFirst: ? L ? S O \n- ""BLPSO"" -> not a word.\n- ""CLASO"" -> A absent? \n- ""FLTSO"" -> not a word.\n\nSecond: ? ? L S O \n- ""COLSO"" -> not common? \n- ""TULSO"" -> U absent? \n- ""PULSO"" -> U absent? \n\nNot many.\n\nPut L at position 4? Then we have pattern: ? ? ? S L \n\nAnd O must be at 0,1,2? But O cannot be at 1? So O at 0 or 2? \n\nPattern: O ? ? S L  OR ? O ? S L \n\nFirst: O ? ? S L \n- ""O M P S L"" -> not a word.\n\nSecond: ? O ? S L \n- ""B O P S L"" -> not a word.\n- ""T O M S L"" -> not a word.\n\nSo it seems ""FLOSS"" is a good candidate? \n\nBut let\'s see if there are other words.\n\nAnother idea: put L at position 2? and O at position 4? Then pattern: ? ? L S O \n\nWords: \n- ""??LSO"" \n- ""PULSO"" -> U absent? \n- ""MOLSO"" -> M O L S O? \n  - M(0), O(1), L(2), S(3), O(4) -> but O at position 1? which is forbidden? Because we know O is not at index 1? \n\nIn ""MOLSO"", O is at index 1? So that\'s not allowed? \n\n- ""COLSO"" -> C O L S O? O at index 1? forbidden.\n\n- ""HOLMS"" -> H O L M S? \n  - H(0), O(1), L(2), M(3), S(4) -> but position 3 is M? not S? We need S at index 3? \n\nSo not.\n\nAnother pattern: put L at position 1? and O at position 4? Then: ? L ? S O \n\nWords: \n- ""B L I S O"" -> I absent? \n- ""B L A S O"" -> A absent? \n- ""C L O S O"" -> O at position 2? and O at 4? \n  - C(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), O(4) -> S at 3? yes? \n  - But O at position 2? which is allowed? \n  - ""CLOSO"" is not a common word? \n\n- ""FLOSO"" -> F L O S O? \n  - F(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), O(4) -> S at 3? \n  - But is ""floso"" a word? I don\'t think so.\n\nSo ""FLOSS"" seems the best so far? \n\nBut note: in ""FLOSS"", we have:\n- F at 0 (new)\n- L at 1 (we know L is present, but we are trying it at position 1? which is allowed? because we only know L is not at 0? so it could be at 1? \n- O at 2 (we know O is present, and we are trying at 2? which is allowed? because we only know O is not at 1? so 2 is okay)\n- S at 3 (correct)\n- S at 4 (new, but we are testing if there is a second S)\n\nSo if we guess ""FLOSS"", we can get information about F and the second S? \n\nBut also, if the secret word does not have F, then we know? \n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have duplicate S? And tests more new letters? \n\nFor example, put L at position 4? and O at position 0? Then pattern: O ? ? S L \n\nWords: \n- ""O C T S L"" -> not a word.\n- ""O M N S L"" -> not a word.\n\nNot working.\n\nPut O at position 0 and L at position 2? Pattern: O ? L S ? \n\nWords: \n- ""O F L S ?"" -> ""OFLS"" and then? \n- ""OFLES"" -> E absent? \n- ""OILSS"" -> I absent? \n- ""OWLSS"" -> W is available? ""OWLSS"" is not a word? \n\n""OWLS"" is 4 letters? \n\nHow about ""OLLAS"" -> A absent? \n\nNot working.\n\nAnother idea: put L at position 2 and O at position 0? Same as above.\n\nOr put L at position 4 and O at position 2? Pattern: ? ? O S L \n\nWords: \n- ""B C O S L"" -> not a word.\n- ""S C O S L"" -> S at 0? but we are not sure? \n- ""T O O S L"" -> T O O S L? \n  - T(0), O(1), O(2), S(3), L(4) -> but O at position 1? which is forbidden? \n\nSo not.\n\nAfter trying, ""FLOSS"" seems a valid word that fits? \n\nBut let me check if there are other words? \n\nWhat about ""CLOTS"": C L O T S? \n- C(0), L(1), O(2), T(3), S(4) -> but position 3 is T? not S? We need S at 3? \n\nNot.\n\n""BOLTS"": B O L T S? \n- B(0), O(1), L(2), T(3), S(4) -> position 3 is T? not S? \n\nNot.\n\n""POLES"": E absent? \n\n""DOLLS"": D O L L S? \n- D(0), O(1), L(2), L(3), S(4) -> position 3 is L? not S? \n\nNot.\n\n""FLOWS"": F L O W S? \n- F(0), L(1), O(2), W(3), S(4) -> position 3 is W? not S? \n\nNot.\n\n""GLOSS"": G L O S S? \n- G(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), S(4) -> this is similar to ""FLOSS"", but with G? \n\n""GLOSS"" is a word? Yes, meaning shine? \n\nAnd it has S at position 3? \n\nAnd letters: G, L, O, S, S -> no R,A,I,E,U,Y? \n\nSo ""GLOSS"" is also a candidate? \n\nSimilarly, ""SLOSH"": S L O S H? \n- S(0), L(1), O(2), S(3), H(4) -> but position 0 is S? but we don\'t know if S is at 0? But we know there is an S at 3? and if there is another S? \n- But also, in ""SLOSH"", we have S at 0 and S at 3? \n- But we are allowed? \n- However, we know L is present? and O? \n- But in ""SLOSH"", L is at 1? O at 2? \n- But we also have S at 0? which we don\'t know if it is present? \n\nBut note: we know the secret word has S at position 3? But it might have another S? \n\nBut in ""SLOSH"", we are putting S at 0? which is a new position? \n\nBut also, we are testing H? \n\nBut the problem: we know L cannot be at 0? and in ""SLOSH"", L is at 1? which is allowed? O at 2? allowed? \n\nBut is ""SLOSH"" valid? Yes? \n\nBut we have to avoid using absent letters?

But we don\'t know if there is a second S? \n\nBut in ""SLOSH"", we are testing S at 0? which might be present? \n\nBut we have limited guesses? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have duplicate S? To avoid confusion? \n\nFor example, if we can find a word with L and O and S at 3? and two new letters? without duplicate S? \n\nBut earlier attempts failed? \n\nWhat about ""LOVES"": E absent? \n\n""LOOPS"": L O O P S? \n- L(0), O(1), O(2), P(3), S(4) -> position 3 is P? not S? \n\nNot.\n\n""TOILS"": I absent? \n\n""COILS"": I absent? \n\n""POLLS"": P O L L S? \n- P(0), O(1), L(2), L(3), S(4) -> position 3 is L? not S? \n\nNot.\n\n""BOWLS"": B O W L S? \n- B(0), O(1), W(2), L(3), S(4) -> position 3 is L? not S? \n\nNot.\n\n""MOLLS"": M O L L S? \n- M(0), O(1), L(2), L(3), S(4) -> position 3 is L? not S? \n\nNot.\n\n""FOLLY"": Y absent? \n\nSo it seems words with S at position 3 and containing L and O are rare? \n\n""FLOSS"" and ""GLOSS"" are valid? \n\nAnother one: ""SLOWS"": S L O W S? \n- S(0), L(1), O(2), W(3), S(4) -> position 3 is W? not S? \n\nNot.\n\n""BLESS"": E absent? \n\nSo I think ""FLOSS"" or ""GLOSS"" are the best? \n\nLet me choose ""GLOSS"" because G is a common letter? \n\nBut we can also consider ""CLOPS"" but that doesn\'t have S at 3? \n\nAnother word: ""PLOTS"": P L O T S? \n- P(0), L(1), O(2), T(3), S(4) -> position 3 is T? not S? \n\nNot.\n\nSo I think we have to go with ""FLOSS"" or ""GLOSS"" or ""SLOSH"". \n\nBut ""SLOSH"" has S at 0? which might be a problem? Because if the secret word does not have S at 0, then we get feedback that S at 0 is not present? But we already know S is at 3? So if we get an \'x\' for S at 0, that means there is no other S? \n\nSimilarly, in ""FLOSS"", we have S at 4? which is a new position? \n\nBut in ""FLOSS"", we are testing F and the second S? \n\nSimilarly, in ""GLOSS"", we test G and the second S? \n\nIn ""SLOSH"", we test S at 0 and H? \n\nBut we know S is at 3?

We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise"" -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
Meaning:
- R, A, I, E are absent.
- S is present and in the correct position (index 3).

Guess 2: ""lousy"" -> L(-) O(-) U(x) S(✓) Y(x)
Meaning:
- L is present but in the wrong position (not at index 0).
- O is present but in the wrong position (not at index 1).
- U and Y are absent.
- S is present and correct at index 3.

Guess 3: ""gloss"" -> G(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(-)
Meaning:
- G is absent.
- L is present and in the correct position (index 1? because in ""gloss"", L is at index 1).
- O is present and in the correct position (index 2? because in ""gloss"", O is at index 2).
- The first S (at index 3) is correct (we already knew that).
- The second S (at index 4) is present but in the wrong position? But note: the feedback for the last S is marked as (-), meaning present but wrong position? But wait, the secret word has S at index 3, and if there is another S, then the S at index 4 would be marked as present but wrong position? Or if there is no second S, it would be absent? But the feedback says S(-) for the last one? 

But note: in ""gloss"", we have two S's: one at index 3 and one at index 4. The feedback for the S at index 3 is (✓) and for the S at index 4 is (-). 

This means:
- The S at index 3 is correct (as we knew).
- The S at index 4 is present in the word but not at that position? But wait, if the secret word has only one S, then the second S in the guess would be marked as absent (x) because the one S is already accounted for at index 3. However, here it is marked as (-), meaning that there is a second S in the secret word? But it is not at index 4? 

Alternatively, the feedback (-) for the last S means that there is an S in the word that is not at index 4? But we already have an S at index 3? So if there is a second S, then the (-) for the last S indicates that the second S is not at index 4? 

But note: the secret word must have at least two S's? Because if it had only one S, then the second S in the guess would be marked as absent (x). Since it is marked as present but wrong position (-), that means there is a second S in the secret word? 

So now we know:
- The secret word has at least two S's? 
- And the second S is not at index 4? 

But wait, the feedback for the last S is (-), meaning that the letter S is in the word but not at that position? But we already have one S at index 3? So the (-) for the last S (index 4) tells us that there is another S in the secret word (besides the one at index 3) and it is not at index 4? 

Therefore, the secret word has two S's: one at index 3 and one at another position? 

But what about the positions? 

We also have:
- L is at the correct position? In ""gloss"", L was at index 1? So L is at index 1? 
- O is at the correct position? In ""gloss"", O was at index 2? So O is at index 2? 

So from ""gloss"" feedback: 
- G is absent? 
- L is correct at index 1? 
- O is correct at index 2? 
- S is correct at index 3? 
- The last S (index 4) is present but wrong position? 

But if L is at index 1 and O at index 2, and S at index 3? Then the secret word has the form: 
[0] L O S [4]

But we also know that the last S (index 4) is marked as present but wrong position? That means the secret word has another S? But where? It cannot be at index 4? So it must be at index 0? 

Because the positions 1,2,3 are taken by L, O, S? So the only other position is index 0? 

Therefore, the secret word must be: S L O S ?

But wait, we have five positions: 
Index 0: must be S? because the second S is present and not at index 4? and the only position left is index 0? 

But we also have the fifth position? The word is 5 letters: 
Position 0: ? 
Position 1: L (fixed)
Position 2: O (fixed)
Position 3: S (fixed)
Position 4: ? 

But we know that the secret word has two S's? One at index 3 and one at another position? The feedback for the last S (index 4) is (-), meaning that the letter S is in the word but not at index 4? So the second S must be at index 0? 

Therefore, the secret word must have S at index 0? 

So the word is: S L O S ? 

But then what is the last letter? 

But we also know that the last letter (index 4) is not S? So it must be another letter? 

But we have: 
- The secret word: S (index0), L (index1), O (index2), S (index3), and ? (index4)

But we know that the letter at index 4 is not S? So it must be a different letter? 

But we also have constraints on absent letters: R, A, I, E, U, Y, G are absent? 

So the last letter must be a letter that is not in the absent set? 

But what about the feedback for the second S? 

In the guess ""gloss"", we had:
- Index0: G -> absent? 
- Index1: L -> correct? 
- Index2: O -> correct? 
- Index3: S -> correct? 
- Index4: S -> present but wrong position? 

But if the secret word is ""SLOS?"" and the last letter is not S? Then the secret word has two S's: at index0 and index3? 

In the guess ""gloss"", we have:
- The S at index3: matches the secret word's S at index3? so ✓.
- The S at index4: but the secret word has no S at index4? But it has an S at index0? So the S at index4 in the guess should be marked as present but in the wrong position? Because there is an S at index0? 

But the secret word's S at index0 is not in the guess at index0? In the guess, index0 is G? So the S at index0 in the secret word is not accounted for by the guess? So when we put S at index4 in the guess, it matches the S at index0 in the secret word? But that is a different position? So it should be marked as present but wrong position? 

Yes, that matches the feedback? 

So the secret word is: S L O S ? 

Now, what is the last letter? 

We know the absent letters: R, A, I, E, U, Y, G. 

Also, from the first guess, we know no R,A,I,E? and from second guess, no U,Y? and from third guess, no G? 

So the last letter must be a letter from: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z? 

But it must form a valid English word? 

What words are of the form ""SLOS"" + one letter? 

""SLOSH"": S L O S H? 
- H is not absent? 

""SLOSK""? not a word? 
""SLOSM""? not? 
""SLOSN""? not? 
""SLOSP""? not? 
""SLOST""? not? 
""SLOSW""? not? 

""SLOSH"" is a word? Meaning to splash or move with a splash? 

And H is not in the absent list? 

So ""SLOSH"" is a candidate? 

But let's check the feedback we got? 

In the third guess, we had ""gloss"" and the last S was marked as present but wrong position? 

If the secret word is ""SLOSH"", then:
- The secret word: S (0), L (1), O (2), S (3), H (4)
- Guess ""gloss"": G (0) -> absent? 
            L (1) -> correct? 
            O (2) -> correct? 
            S (3) -> correct? 
            S (4) -> but the secret word has H at 4? So the S at 4 in the guess is not present? But wait, the secret word has two S's? at 0 and 3? So the S at 4 in the guess is not matching? But the secret word has no S at 4? 

But the feedback for the last S in ""gloss"" was (-), meaning present but wrong position? 

But if the secret word is ""SLOSH"", then the S at index4 in the guess is not in the secret word? Because the secret word has S at 0 and 3? So the S at 4 in the guess is an extra S? But the secret word has only two S's? So the second S in the guess (at index4) should be marked as absent? Because the two S's in the secret word are already matched? 

But in the feedback, it was marked as (-)? That would be inconsistent? 

Therefore, ""SLOSH"" cannot be the secret word? Because if it were, the last S in ""gloss"" would be absent? 

But the feedback says it is present? 

So the secret word must have three S's? Or at least two S's? But the last S in the guess is marked as present? 

But if the secret word has two S's, and we have already matched one at index3? Then the second S in the guess (at index4) should match the other S? But if the other S is at index0? Then the S at index4 in the guess is not matching? So it should be marked as present but wrong position? 

In the secret word ""SLOSH"", the S at index0 is not matched by the guess? Because the guess has G at index0? So the S at index0 in the secret word is unmatched? 

Then, when we look at the S at index4 in the guess, it is not in the secret word? Because the secret word has no S at index4? And the two S's in the secret word are already matched? The S at index3 is matched by the guess's S at index3? And the S at index0 is unmatched? But the guess has no S at index0? 

In the feedback mechanism, for each letter in the guess, we check:

- First, mark the exact matches? 
  - Index1: L matches? 
  - Index2: O matches? 
  - Index3: S matches? 
- Then, for the remaining letters in the guess, we check if they are in the secret word but not matched? 

In the guess, we have:
- Index0: G -> not in secret? 
- Index4: S -> is there an unmatched S in the secret word? 

In the secret word ""SLOSH"", we have two S's: 
- The S at index3 is matched? 
- The S at index0 is unmatched? 

So the S at index4 in the guess can be matched to the S at index0 in the secret word? But the position is wrong? So it should be marked as present but wrong position? 

Yes, that's how Wordle works? 

So in ""SLOSH"", the S at index4 in the guess would be marked as present but wrong position? Because there is an unmatched S at index0? 

Therefore, ""SLOSH"" is a valid candidate? 

But what about the last letter? In ""SLOSH"", the last letter is H? 

And H is not in the absent list? 

So the secret word could be ""SLOSH"". 

But are there other possibilities? 

The secret word must be of the form: 
- Index0: must be S? because the second S must be at index0? 
- Index1: L
- Index2: O
- Index3: S
- Index4: ? 

And the last letter must be a letter that is not absent? 

But we have only one candidate: ""SLOSH""? 

But let me check: 
- ""SLOSK"" -> not a word? 
- ""SLOSP"" -> not? 
- ""SLOST"" -> not? 
- ""SLOSM"" -> not? 
- ""SLOSW"" -> not? 
- ""SLOSB"" -> not? 
- ""SLOSH"" -> valid? 

So ""SLOSH"" is the only candidate? 

But what about ""SLOTS""? But T is available? 
- ""SLOTS"": S L O T S? 
  - Then index3 is T? not S? But we need index3 to be S? 

Not.

""SLOWS"": S L O W S? 
- Then index3 is W? not S? 

Not.

""SLAPS"": A absent? 

""SLIPS"": I absent? 

So only ""SLOSH"" seems to fit? 

But we must confirm: in the first guess, we had ""raise"" and S was at index3? and in ""SLOSH"", S is at index3? and also at index0? 

And in the second guess ""lousy"", we had L and O present but not at 0 and 1? In ""SLOSH"", L is at index1? which is the same as in ""lousy""? But in ""lousy"", L was at index0? and we got feedback that L is present but not at index0? So in ""SLOSH"", L is at index1? which is a different position? So that's okay? 

Similarly, O in ""lousy"" was at index1? and in ""SLOSH"", O is at index2? which is different? 

So ""SLOSH"" fits all? 

Therefore, we can guess ""SLOSH""? 

But we are to make a guess? 

But note: we have only 6 guesses? and we are on guess 4? 

But we can guess ""SLOSH"" and if it's correct, we win? 

But let me see if there are other possibilities? 

What if the secret word has three S's? 

For example, ""SLOSS""? But that's not a word? 

Or ""SLOPS"": S L O P S? 
- Then index3 is P? not S? 

Not.

So I think ""SLOSH"" is the only possibility? 

Therefore, we guess ""SLOSH"". 

But let's double-check the feedback for ""gloss"" with ""SLOSH"":

Secret: S L O S H

Guess: G L O S S

- G: not in secret? -> x
- L: at index1? matches? -> ✓
- O: at index2? matches? -> ✓
- S: at index3? matches? -> ✓
- S: at index4? secret has H at index4? but there is an unmatched S at index0? So the S at index4 in the guess is matched to the S at index0? so present but wrong position? -> (-)

Yes, matches the feedback? 

So the secret word must be ""SLOSH"". 

Therefore, we guess ""SLOSH"". 

But note: we are to make a new guess? 

So <guess>slosh</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""raise"" → Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(x)**  
   - **S** is in the secret word and **correctly positioned at index 3** (4th letter).  
   - **R, A, I, E** are **absent**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""lousy"" → Feedback: L(-) O(-) U(x) S(✓) Y(x)**  
   - **S** is confirmed at index 3 (✓).  
   - **L and O** are **present** but in **wrong positions** (L not at index 0, O not at index 1).  
   - **U and Y** are **absent**.  

3. **Guess 3: ""gloss"" → Feedback: G(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(-)**  
   - **G** is **absent**.  
   - **L is fixed at index 1** (✓).  
   - **O is fixed at index 2** (✓).  
   - **S is fixed at index 3** (✓).  
   - The **second S (index 4)** is **present but misplaced** (-), confirming:  
     - The secret word has **at least two S's**.  
     - The second S is **not at index 4** and must be at **index 0** (the only remaining position).  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret Word Structure**:  
  - **Index 0**: Must be **S** (from the misplaced S feedback in ""gloss"").  
  - **Index 1**: **L** (fixed).  
  - **Index 2**: **O** (fixed).  
  - **Index 3**: **S** (fixed).  
  - **Index 4**: Unknown letter (not S, and not in absent list).  
- **Absent Letters**: R, A, I, E, U, Y, G.  
- **Possible Letters for Index 4**: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z (since all vowels and common consonants like R, L, S are already tested).  
- **Valid Word Check**: The only common English word fitting `S L O S _` is **""SLOSH""** (meaning to splash or move liquid).  

### Why ""SLOSH""?
- **S at index 0**: Matches the requirement for the second S.  
- **L at index 1, O at index 2, S at index 3**: All fixed positions confirmed.  
- **H at index 4**: Tests a new consonant (H), which is not in the absent list.  
- **Validation**:  
  - If correct, ""SLOSH"" solves the puzzle.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on H will reveal the last letter.

But wait, the secret word has S at index 3, and if there is another S, then the S at index 4 would be marked as present but wrong position? Or if there is no second S, it would be absent? But the feedback says S(-) for the last one? 

But note: in ""gloss"", we have two S's: one at index 3 and one at index 4. The feedback for the S at index 3 is (✓) and for the S at index 4 is (-). 

This means:
- The S at index 3 is correct (as we knew).
- The S at index 4 is present in the word but not at that position? But wait, if the secret word has only one S, then the second S in the guess would be marked as absent (x) because the one S is already accounted for at index 3. However, here it is marked as (-), meaning that there is a second S in the secret word? But it is not at index 4? 

Alternatively, the feedback (-) for the last S means that there is an S in the word that is not at index 4? But we already have an S at index 3? So if there is a second S, then the (-) for the last S indicates that the second S is not at index 4? 

But note: the secret word must have at least two S's? Because if it had only one S, then the second S in the guess would be marked as absent (x). Since it is marked as present but wrong position (-), that means there is a second S in the secret word? 

So now we know:
- The secret word has at least two S's? 
- And the second S is not at index 4? 

But wait, the feedback for the last S is (-), meaning that the letter S is in the word but not at that position? But we already have one S at index 3? So the (-) for the last S (index 4) tells us that there is another S in the secret word (besides the one at index 3) and it is not at index 4? 

Therefore, the secret word has two S's: one at index 3 and one at another position? 

But what about the positions? 

We also have:
- L is at the correct position? In ""gloss"", L was at index 1? So L is at index 1? 
- O is at the correct position? In ""gloss"", O was at index 2? So O is at index 2? 

So from ""gloss"" feedback: 
- G is absent? 
- L is correct at index 1? 
- O is correct at index 2? 
- S is correct at index 3? 
- The last S (index 4) is present but wrong position? 

But if L is at index 1 and O at index 2, and S at index 3? Then the secret word has the form: 
[0] L O S [4]

But we also know that the last S (index 4) is marked as present but wrong position? That means the secret word has another S? But where? It cannot be at index 4? So it must be at index 0? 

Because the positions 1,2,3 are taken by L, O, S? So the only other position is index 0? 

Therefore, the secret word must be: S L O S ?

But wait, we have five positions: 
Index 0: must be S? because the second S is present and not at index 4? and the only position left is index 0? 

But we also have the fifth position? The word is 5 letters: 
Position 0: ? 
Position 1: L (fixed)
Position 2: O (fixed)
Position 3: S (fixed)
Position 4: ? 

But we know that the secret word has two S's? One at index 3 and one at another position? The feedback for the last S (index 4) is (-), meaning that the letter S is in the word but not at index 4? So the second S must be at index 0? 

Therefore, the secret word must have S at index 0? 

So the word is: S L O S ? 

But then what is the last letter? 

But we also know that the last letter (index 4) is not S? So it must be another letter? 

But we have: 
- The secret word: S (index0), L (index1), O (index2), S (index3), and ? (index4)

But we know that the letter at index 4 is not S? So it must be a different letter? 

But we also have constraints on absent letters: R, A, I, E, U, Y, G are absent? 

So the last letter must be a letter that is not in the absent set? 

But what about the feedback for the second S? 

In the guess ""gloss"", we had:
- Index0: G -> absent? 
- Index1: L -> correct? 
- Index2: O -> correct? 
- Index3: S -> correct? 
- Index4: S -> present but wrong position? 

But if the secret word is ""SLOS?"" and the last letter is not S? Then the secret word has two S's: at index0 and index3? 

In the guess ""gloss"", we have:
- The S at index3: matches the secret word's S at index3? so ✓.
- The S at index4: but the secret word has no S at index4? But it has an S at index0? So the S at index4 in the guess should be marked as present but in the wrong position? Because there is an S at index0? 

But the secret word's S at index0 is not in the guess at index0? In the guess, index0 is G? So the S at index0 in the secret word is not accounted for by the guess? So when we put S at index4 in the guess, it matches the S at index0 in the secret word? But that is a different position? So it should be marked as present but wrong position? 

Yes, that matches the feedback? 

So the secret word is: S L O S ? 

Now, what is the last letter? 

We know the absent letters: R, A, I, E, U, Y, G. 

Also, from the first guess, we know no R,A,I,E? and from second guess, no U,Y? and from third guess, no G? 

So the last letter must be a letter from: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z? 

But it must form a valid English word? 

What words are of the form ""SLOS"" + one letter? 

""SLOSH"": S L O S H? 
- H is not absent? 

""SLOSK""? not a word? 
""SLOSM""? not? 
""SLOSN""? not? 
""SLOSP""? not? 
""SLOST""? not? 
""SLOSW""? not? 

""SLOSH"" is a word? Meaning to splash or move with a splash? 

And H is not in the absent list? 

So ""SLOSH"" is a candidate? 

But let's check the feedback we got? 

In the third guess, we had ""gloss"" and the last S was marked as present but wrong position? 

If the secret word is ""SLOSH"", then:
- The secret word: S (0), L (1), O (2), S (3), H (4)
- Guess ""gloss"": G (0) -> absent? 
            L (1) -> correct? 
            O (2) -> correct? 
            S (3) -> correct? 
            S (4) -> but the secret word has H at 4? So the S at 4 in the guess is not present? But wait, the secret word has two S's? at 0 and 3? So the S at 4 in the guess is not matching? But the secret word has no S at 4? 

But the feedback for the last S in ""gloss"" was (-), meaning present but wrong position? 

But if the secret word is ""SLOSH"", then the S at index4 in the guess is not in the secret word? Because the secret word has S at 0 and 3? So the S at 4 in the guess is an extra S? But the secret word has only two S's? So the second S in the guess (at index4) should be marked as absent? Because the two S's in the secret word are already matched? 

But in the feedback, it was marked as (-)? That would be inconsistent? 

Therefore, ""SLOSH"" cannot be the secret word? Because if it were, the last S in ""gloss"" would be absent? 

But the feedback says it is present? 

So the secret word must have three S's? Or at least two S's? But the last S in the guess is marked as present? 

But if the secret word has two S's, and we have already matched one at index3? Then the second S in the guess (at index4) should match the other S? But if the other S is at index0? Then the S at index4 in the guess is not matching? So it should be marked as present but wrong position? 

In the secret word ""SLOSH"", the S at index0 is not matched by the guess? Because the guess has G at index0? So the S at index0 in the secret word is unmatched? 

Then, when we look at the S at index4 in the guess, it is not in the secret word? Because the secret word has no S at index4? And the two S's in the secret word are already matched? The S at index3 is matched by the guess's S at index3? And the S at index0 is unmatched? But the guess has no S at index0? 

In the feedback mechanism, for each letter in the guess, we check:

- First, mark the exact matches? 
  - Index1: L matches? 
  - Index2: O matches? 
  - Index3: S matches? 
- Then, for the remaining letters in the guess, we check if they are in the secret word but not matched? 

In the guess, we have:
- Index0: G -> not in secret? 
- Index4: S -> is there an unmatched S in the secret word? 

In the secret word ""SLOSH"", we have two S's: 
- The S at index3 is matched? 
- The S at index0 is unmatched? 

So the S at index4 in the guess can be matched to the S at index0 in the secret word? But the position is wrong? So it should be marked as present but wrong position? 

Yes, that's how Wordle works? 

So in ""SLOSH"", the S at index4 in the guess would be marked as present but wrong position? Because there is an unmatched S at index0? 

Therefore, ""SLOSH"" is a valid candidate? 

But what about the last letter? In ""SLOSH"", the last letter is H? 

And H is not in the absent list? 

So the secret word could be ""SLOSH"". 

But are there other possibilities? 

The secret word must be of the form: 
- Index0: must be S? because the second S must be at index0? 
- Index1: L
- Index2: O
- Index3: S
- Index4: ? 

And the last letter must be a letter that is not absent? 

But we have only one candidate: ""SLOSH""? 

But let me check: 
- ""SLOSK"" -> not a word? 
- ""SLOSP"" -> not? 
- ""SLOST"" -> not? 
- ""SLOSM"" -> not? 
- ""SLOSW"" -> not? 
- ""SLOSB"" -> not? 
- ""SLOSH"" -> valid? 

So ""SLOSH"" is the only candidate? 

But what about ""SLOTS""? But T is available? 
- ""SLOTS"": S L O T S? 
  - Then index3 is T? not S? But we need index3 to be S? 

Not.

""SLOWS"": S L O W S? 
- Then index3 is W? not S? 

Not.

""SLAPS"": A absent? 

""SLIPS"": I absent? 

So only ""SLOSH"" seems to fit? 

But we must confirm: in the first guess, we had ""raise"" and S was at index3? and in ""SLOSH"", S is at index3? and also at index0? 

And in the second guess ""lousy"", we had L and O present but not at 0 and 1? In ""SLOSH"", L is at index1? which is the same as in ""lousy""? But in ""lousy"", L was at index0? and we got feedback that L is present but not at index0? So in ""SLOSH"", L is at index1? which is a different position? So that's okay? 

Similarly, O in ""lousy"" was at index1? and in ""SLOSH"", O is at index2? which is different? 

So ""SLOSH"" fits all? 

Therefore, we can guess ""SLOSH""? 

But we are to make a guess? 

But note: we have only 6 guesses? and we are on guess 4? 

But we can guess ""SLOSH"" and if it's correct, we win? 

But let me see if there are other possibilities? 

What if the secret word has three S's? 

For example, ""SLOSS""? But that's not a word? 

Or ""SLOPS"": S L O P S? 
- Then index3 is P? not S? 

Not.

So I think ""SLOSH"" is the only possibility? 

Therefore, we guess ""SLOSH"". 

But let's double-check the feedback for ""gloss"" with ""SLOSH"":

Secret: S L O S H

Guess: G L O S S

- G: not in secret? -> x
- L: at index1? matches? -> ✓
- O: at index2? matches? -> ✓
- S: at index3? matches? -> ✓
- S: at index4? secret has H at index4? but there is an unmatched S at index0? So the S at index4 in the guess is matched to the S at index0? so present but wrong position? -> (-)

Yes, matches the feedback? 

So the secret word must be ""SLOSH"". 

Therefore, we guess ""SLOSH"". 

But note: we are to make a new guess? 

So <guess>slosh</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""raise"" → Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(x)**  
   - **S** is in the secret word and **correctly positioned at index 3** (4th letter).  
   - **R, A, I, E** are **absent**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""lousy"" → Feedback: L(-) O(-) U(x) S(✓) Y(x)**  
   - **S** is confirmed at index 3 (✓).  
   - **L and O** are **present** but in **wrong positions** (L not at index 0, O not at index 1).  
   - **U and Y** are **absent**.  

3. **Guess 3: ""gloss"" → Feedback: G(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(-)**  
   - **G** is **absent**.  
   - **L is fixed at index 1** (✓).  
   - **O is fixed at index 2** (✓).  
   - **S is fixed at index 3** (✓).  
   - The **second S (index 4)** is **present but misplaced** (-), confirming:  
     - The secret word has **at least two S's**.  
     - The second S is **not at index 4** and must be at **index 0** (the only remaining position).  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret Word Structure**:  
  - **Index 0**: Must be **S** (from the misplaced S feedback in ""gloss"").  
  - **Index 1**: **L** (fixed).  
  - **Index 2**: **O** (fixed).  
  - **Index 3**: **S** (fixed).  
  - **Index 4**: Unknown letter (not S, and not in absent list).  
- **Absent Letters**: R, A, I, E, U, Y, G.  
- **Possible Letters for Index 4**: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z (since all vowels and common consonants like R, L, S are already tested).  
- **Valid Word Check**: The only common English word fitting `S L O S _` is **""SLOSH""** (meaning to splash or move liquid).  

### Why ""SLOSH""?
- **S at index 0**: Matches the requirement for the second S.  
- **L at index 1, O at index 2, S at index 3**: All fixed positions confirmed.  
- **H at index 4**: Tests a new consonant (H), which is not in the absent list.  
- **Validation**:  
  - If correct, ""SLOSH"" solves the puzzle.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on H will reveal the last letter.",Guess 4: slosh -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(✓) O(✓) S(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
