Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is in the correct position (✓) - meaning N is the 4th letter
- E is not in the word (x)

The secret word has 5 letters. We know that the 4th letter is N.

Letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all. So we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

We need to guess a 5-letter word where:
- The 4th letter is N.
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.

Possible letters: We need to consider letters that are not excluded. Since only C,R,A,E are excluded, the rest of the alphabet is available, but we should focus on common letters.

The word structure so far: _ _ _ N _

We need to fill the first three positions and the last position with letters that are not C,R,A,E.

Common consonants and vowels to consider: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But vowels are important: Remaining vowels could be I,O,U (since A and E are out). Also, Y sometimes acts as a vowel.

Good strategy: Pick a word that tests new common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Possible words ending with N in the 4th position? Actually, the N is in the 4th position, so the word is like _ _ _ N _, with the last letter unknown.

We should use words with high-frequency letters we haven't tested yet.

Letters not tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We used C,R,A,N,E in the first guess, but N is confirmed, so avoid C,R,A,E.

Common letters to test: S, T, L, O, etc.

A good next guess might be something like ""POINT"" but wait, ""POINT"" has P,O,I,N,T. N is in the 4th position? Let's see:
P O I N T -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T

In ""POINT"", N is indeed the 4th letter, which matches.

But we need to ensure we don't use excluded letters. POINT uses P,O,I,N,T. None of these are C,R,A,E, so it should be fine.

POINT contains I and O, which are vowels we haven't tested.

Other options: We could try words like ""JOINT"", ""MOINT"" isn't a word. ""MOUNT"" has U and T, but U is not tested. However, ""MOUNT"" has U, and N is 4th? M O U N T -> 4th is N, yes. But does it have excluded letters? M,O,U,N,T - no C,R,A,E, so okay. But ""POINT"" seems more common.

""SLING"" - S,L,I,N,G. But N is 4th? S L I N G -> 1:S,2:L,3:I,4:N,5:G - yes, position 4 is N.

But G is the last letter, not tested.

Another possibility: ""BLIND"" - B,L,I,N,D -> positions:1:B,2:L,3:I,4:N,5:D.

All new letters except N.

Which one to choose?

Since we have only one letter fixed (N at position 4), we need to maximize information by testing multiple new letters.

""POINT"" uses P,O,I,T (and N known).

""SLING"" uses S,L,I,G (and N).

Both test four new letters.

Similarly, ""BLIND"" uses B,L,I,D.

We might want to test a vowel if possible, since we know A and E are out. Vowels available: I,O,U,Y.

Words with O or I could be good.

Also, avoid repeating letters.

Another common starting word is ""SPOIL"" but here we have constraint that 4th must be N.

So, what about ""SPINE""? S,P,I,N,E but E is excluded! Cannot use E.

Because feedback said E is not in the word.

Similarly, cannot have C,R,A,E.

So ""POINT"" is okay.

Let's confirm the spelling: POINT is a valid word.

Perhaps ""JOINT"" or ""FOINT"" not a word, so POINT is fine.

Other words: ""STING"" has S,T,I,N,G. S T I N G -> position 4 is N? Let's count: S(1),T(2),I(3),N(4),G(5) - yes.

Similarly, ""STING"" uses, S,T,I,G - all new except N.

Compared with POINT: both test different sets.

Since R and A are out, and S is common, perhaps STING is good.

STING contains I, which might help with vowels.

Similarly, ""SWING"" could be, but W is less common.

To cover more vowel possibilities, testing O or U might help.

But in POINT, we have O, which is a vowel not yet tested.

In STING, we have I, a vowel.

Both similar.

Perhaps ""POINT"" is slightly better? Or ""TUNIC"" but T U N I C has C which is excluded, invalid.

Cannot use C.

""LUNCH"" has C, excluded.

So, back to POINT or STING.

Another idea: ""NOISY"" N O I S Y - N is the first letter, not fourth. We need N as fourth.

So position must be _ _ _ N _

The word must have N as the fourth letter.

So words ending in N? No, fourth letter N means the word is prefix + 4th:N + suffix.

For example: ??N? like in BLINd, POINt, STINg, etc.

Also, MINTS - M I N T S, but 4th letter? M(1),I(2),N(3),T(4),S(5) - position 3 is N, not 4. Wrong.

Fourth position means after three letters, the fourth is N.

Similarly, ""BONUS"" - B O N U S - positions: B(1),O(2),N(3),U(4),S(5) so N is third, not fourth.

So not applicable.

""PLAIN"" P L A I N - has A excluded, and N is fifth, position: P(1),L(2),A(3),I(4),N(5) - fourth is I, not N.

We need fourth position N.

Examples: BEGIN - B E G I N - E excluded, and N is fifth.

""CHAIN"" C and A excluded, no.

""TRAIN"" - T R A I N - R and A excluded.

""STAIN"" - S T A I N - A excluded.

""PLANE"" - P L A N E - A and E excluded.

So POINT is good.

Other options: JOINT, POINT, MOUNT (M O U N T), FAINT has A excluded, PAINT has A excluded, QUINT has Q which is rare, but valid? QUINT is a word? Quint means five, could be.

But POINT is more common.

HINT - H I N T, but H I N T is 4 letters? No, HINT has 4 letters, we need 5 letters.

All words must be 5 letters.

So POINT: P-O-I-N-T

MOUNT: M-O-U-N-T

JOINT: J-O-I-N-T - J is less common.

OINT isn't a root, but JOINT is fine.

""MINDS"" M I N D S - positions: M(1),I(2),N(3),D(4),S(5) - N is third, not fourth.

To have fourth letter: the word pattern is XXXNX, where X are letters to guess.

XXXN_ 

And last letter also.

So perhaps ""ADMIN"" has A and I, A excluded.

""BEGIN"" B E G I N - E excluded.

""BRAIN"" B R A I N - R and A excluded.

So reasonable options: POINT, MOUNT, STING, SLING, etc.

STING: S T I N G - positions: S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) - perfect, N is fourth.

Similarly, SWING, STING, etc.

BLIND: B L I N D - B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) - also good.

Among these, let's choose one that tests more common letters and tries a different vowel from what we excluded.

We excluded A,E, so test O or U or I.

POINT tests O and I.

STING tests I.

BLIND tests I.

MOUNT tests O and U.

MOUNT: M-O-U-N-T

U is a vowel that might be important.

Since we have N fixed, testing U could be useful.

I think any of these are fine, but let's go with MOUNT to test U and O.

Or POINT to test O.

Perhaps STING is good because S and T are common.

I recall that in Wordle, it's good to try multiple vowels.

Since we have I available in many, MOUNT has O and U.

BLUND has B,L,U,N,D but U is vowel, and BLUND isn't a word; it's BLU N D? Not 5 letters.

BLIND only has I.

WORD: W O R D - 4 letters.

So MOUNT seems solid.

Another word: ""COUNT"" C O U N T - C excluded? C is excluded from first feedback.

C is not in word, so cannot use C. COUNT contains C.

Similarly, ""FOUND"" F O U N D - excludes C,R,A,E, fine.

F O U N D - positions: F(1),O(2),U(3),N(4),D(5) - N is fourth.

Good, FOUND is another option.

But it has U and O both.

Similarly, MOUNT, POUND, SOUND, etc.

But SOUND: S O U N D - same as found, S O U N D.

SOUND uses S,O,U,D - all new except N.

Similarly, FOUND uses F,O,U,D.

MOUNT uses M,O,U,T - T is common.

I think SOUND might be better because S is very common.

But let's not use SOUND because S is common, and we can test T instead.

We used S in crane? Crane had S? No, crane is C R A N E - no S.

Letters we have not used: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z we used C,R,A,N,E but N is fixed, so avoid other used letters except we can repeat N? But since it's fixed position, repeating N elsewhere might not be useful.

In feedback, for crane, N was correct, so it's in the word at position 4, and if we guess another position, it might be wrong, but possible.

However, in this case, we are using N only at position 4, so it's fine.

But words like SINEW have E excluded, no.

So SOUND: S O U N D

But it tests S,O,U,D.

MOUNT: M O U N T tests M,O,U,T.

STING: S T I N G tests S,T,I,G.

POINT: P O I N T tests P,O,I,T.

Comparing, all test various.

Perhaps POINT or STING.

I think ""STING"" is a good choice because it uses S,T which are common, and I for vowel.

And avoids O U which we can test later.

Since only 6 tries, we need to be efficient.

Another thought: since N is fixed, the last letter cannot be E because E is out, similarly not C,R,A.

So last letter possibilities: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z etc.

In POINT, last is T, which might indicate if T is present.

Similarly.

I'll go with STING.

STING: S T I N G

Positions: S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)

All letters except N are new and not excluded.

So guess: sting

Formally: STING
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, and E are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
- N is in the correct position (4th letter is confirmed as ""N"").

The secret word has the form: _ _ _ N _, with letters C, R, A, and E excluded.

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, or E.
- Test new common letters to gather more information, especially focusing on possible vowels (like O, I, U) and consonants like S, T, G.
- Choose a word that fits the pattern _ _ _ N _ to maintain the correct position of ""N"" and ensure all letters are valid.

""STING"" is a suitable choice:
- S, T, I, N, G: All letters except ""N"" are new and not excluded.
- Tests S, T, I, and G while confirming the ""N"" position.
- Provides good coverage: S and T are high-frequency consonants; I is a vowel option since A and E are out.

This guess maximizes potential information gain by covering multiple untested letters.

""SLING"" - S,L,I,N,G. But N is 4th? S L I N G -> 1:S,2:L,3:I,4:N,5:G - yes, position 4 is N.

Letters we have not used: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z we used C,R,A,N,E but N is fixed, so avoid other used letters except we can repeat N? But since it's fixed position, repeating N elsewhere might not be useful.

In feedback, for crane, N was correct, so it's in the word at position 4, and if we guess another position, it might be wrong, but possible.

However, in this case, we are using N only at position 4, so it's fine.

But words like SINEW have E excluded, no.

So SOUND: S O U N D

But it tests S,O,U,D.

MOUNT: M O U N T tests M,O,U,T.

STING: S T I N G tests S,T,I,G.

POINT: P O I N T tests P,O,I,T.

Comparing, all test various.

Perhaps POINT or STING.

I think ""STING"" is a good choice because it uses S,T which are common, and I for vowel.

And avoids O U which we can test later.

Since only 6 tries, we need to be efficient.

Another thought: since N is fixed, the last letter cannot be E because E is out, similarly not C,R,A.

So last letter possibilities: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z etc.

In POINT, last is T, which might indicate if T is present.

Similarly.

I'll go with STING.

STING: S T I N G

Positions: S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)

All letters except N are new and not excluded.

So guess: sting

Formally: STINGBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, and E are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
- N is in the correct position (4th letter is confirmed as ""N"").

The secret word has the form: _ _ _ N _, with letters C, R, A, and E excluded.

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, or E.
- Test new common letters to gather more information, especially focusing on possible vowels (like O, I, U) and consonants like S, T, G.
- Choose a word that fits the pattern _ _ _ N _ to maintain the correct position of ""N"" and ensure all letters are valid.

""STING"" is a suitable choice:
- S, T, I, N, G: All letters except ""N"" are new and not excluded.
- Tests S, T, I, and G while confirming the ""N"" position.
- Provides good coverage: S and T are high-frequency consonants; I is a vowel option since A and E are out.

This guess maximizes potential information gain by covering multiple untested letters.",Guess 2: sting -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) I(x) N(✓) G(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,FOUND,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is in the correct position (✓) - meaning N is the 4th letter
- E is not in the word (x)

The secret word has 5 letters. We know that the 4th letter is N.

Letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all. So we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

We need to guess a 5-letter word where:
- The 4th letter is N.
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.

Possible letters: We need to consider letters that are not excluded. Since only C,R,A,E are excluded, the rest of the alphabet is available, but we should focus on common letters.

The word structure so far: _ _ _ N _

We need to fill the first three positions and the last position with letters that are not C,R,A,E.

Common consonants and vowels to consider: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But vowels are important: Remaining vowels could be I,O,U (since A and E are out). Also, Y sometimes acts as a vowel.

Good strategy: Pick a word that tests new common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Possible words ending with N in the 4th position? Actually, the N is in the 4th position, so the word is like _ _ _ N _, with the last letter unknown.

We should use words with high-frequency letters we haven't tested yet.

Letters not tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We used C,R,A,N,E in the first guess, but N is confirmed, so avoid C,R,A,E.

Common letters to test: S, T, L, O, etc.

A good next guess might be something like ""POINT"" but wait, ""POINT"" has P,O,I,N,T. N is in the 4th position? Let's see:
P O I N T -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T

In ""POINT"", N is indeed the 4th letter, which matches.

But we need to ensure we don't use excluded letters. POINT uses P,O,I,N,T. None of these are C,R,A,E, so it should be fine.

POINT contains I and O, which are vowels we haven't tested.

Other options: We could try words like ""JOINT"", ""MOINT"" isn't a word. ""MOUNT"" has U and T, but U is not tested. However, ""MOUNT"" has U, and N is 4th? M O U N T -> 4th is N, yes. But does it have excluded letters? M,O,U,N,T - no C,R,A,E, so okay. But ""POINT"" seems more common.

""SLING"" - S,L,I,N,G. But N is 4th? S L I N G -> 1:S,2:L,3:I,4:N,5:G - yes, position 4 is N.

But G is the last letter, not tested.

Another possibility: ""BLIND"" - B,L,I,N,D -> positions:1:B,2:L,3:I,4:N,5:D.

All new letters except N.

Which one to choose?

Since we have only one letter fixed (N at position 4), we need to maximize information by testing multiple new letters.

""POINT"" uses P,O,I,T (and N known).

""SLING"" uses S,L,I,G (and N).

Both test four new letters.

Similarly, ""BLIND"" uses B,L,I,D.

We might want to test a vowel if possible, since we know A and E are out. Vowels available: I,O,U,Y.

Words with O or I could be good.

Also, avoid repeating letters.

Another common starting word is ""SPOIL"" but here we have constraint that 4th must be N.

So, what about ""SPINE""? S,P,I,N,E but E is excluded! Cannot use E.

Because feedback said E is not in the word.

Similarly, cannot have C,R,A,E.

So ""POINT"" is okay.

Let's confirm the spelling: POINT is a valid word.

Perhaps ""JOINT"" or ""FOINT"" not a word, so POINT is fine.

Other words: ""STING"" has S,T,I,N,G. S T I N G -> position 4 is N? Let's count: S(1),T(2),I(3),N(4),G(5) - yes.

Similarly, ""STING"" uses, S,T,I,G - all new except N.

Compared with POINT: both test different sets.

Since R and A are out, and S is common, perhaps STING is good.

STING contains I, which might help with vowels.

Similarly, ""SWING"" could be, but W is less common.

To cover more vowel possibilities, testing O or U might help.

But in POINT, we have O, which is a vowel not yet tested.

In STING, we have I, a vowel.

Both similar.

Perhaps ""POINT"" is slightly better? Or ""TUNIC"" but T U N I C has C which is excluded, invalid.

Cannot use C.

""LUNCH"" has C, excluded.

So, back to POINT or STING.

Another idea: ""NOISY"" N O I S Y - N is the first letter, not fourth. We need N as fourth.

So position must be _ _ _ N _

The word must have N as the fourth letter.

So words ending in N? No, fourth letter N means the word is prefix + 4th:N + suffix.

For example: ??N? like in BLINd, POINt, STINg, etc.

Also, MINTS - M I N T S, but 4th letter? M(1),I(2),N(3),T(4),S(5) - position 3 is N, not 4. Wrong.

Fourth position means after three letters, the fourth is N.

Similarly, ""BONUS"" - B O N U S - positions: B(1),O(2),N(3),U(4),S(5) so N is third, not fourth.

So not applicable.

""PLAIN"" P L A I N - has A excluded, and N is fifth, position: P(1),L(2),A(3),I(4),N(5) - fourth is I, not N.

We need fourth position N.

Examples: BEGIN - B E G I N - E excluded, and N is fifth.

""CHAIN"" C and A excluded, no.

""TRAIN"" - T R A I N - R and A excluded.

""STAIN"" - S T A I N - A excluded.

""PLANE"" - P L A N E - A and E excluded.

So POINT is good.

Other options: JOINT, POINT, MOUNT (M O U N T), FAINT has A excluded, PAINT has A excluded, QUINT has Q which is rare, but valid? QUINT is a word? Quint means five, could be.

But POINT is more common.

HINT - H I N T, but H I N T is 4 letters? No, HINT has 4 letters, we need 5 letters.

All words must be 5 letters.

So POINT: P-O-I-N-T

MOUNT: M-O-U-N-T

JOINT: J-O-I-N-T - J is less common.

OINT isn't a root, but JOINT is fine.

""MINDS"" M I N D S - positions: M(1),I(2),N(3),D(4),S(5) - N is third, not fourth.

To have fourth letter: the word pattern is XXXNX, where X are letters to guess.

XXXN_ 

And last letter also.

So perhaps ""ADMIN"" has A and I, A excluded.

""BEGIN"" B E G I N - E excluded.

""BRAIN"" B R A I N - R and A excluded.

So reasonable options: POINT, MOUNT, STING, SLING, etc.

STING: S T I N G - positions: S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) - perfect, N is fourth.

Similarly, SWING, STING, etc.

BLIND: B L I N D - B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) - also good.

Among these, let's choose one that tests more common letters and tries a different vowel from what we excluded.

We excluded A,E, so test O or U or I.

POINT tests O and I.

STING tests I.

BLIND tests I.

MOUNT tests O and U.

MOUNT: M-O-U-N-T

U is a vowel that might be important.

Since we have N fixed, testing U could be useful.

I think any of these are fine, but let's go with MOUNT to test U and O.

Or POINT to test O.

Perhaps STING is good because S and T are common.

I recall that in Wordle, it's good to try multiple vowels.

Since we have I available in many, MOUNT has O and U.

BLUND has B,L,U,N,D but U is vowel, and BLUND isn't a word; it's BLU N D? Not 5 letters.

BLIND only has I.

WORD: W O R D - 4 letters.

So MOUNT seems solid.

Another word: ""COUNT"" C O U N T - C excluded? C is excluded from first feedback.

C is not in word, so cannot use C. COUNT contains C.

Similarly, ""FOUND"" F O U N D - excludes C,R,A,E, fine.

F O U N D - positions: F(1),O(2),U(3),N(4),D(5) - N is fourth.

Good, FOUND is another option.

But it has U and O both.

Similarly, MOUNT, POUND, SOUND, etc.

But SOUND: S O U N D - same as found, S O U N D.

SOUND uses S,O,U,D - all new except N.

Similarly, FOUND uses F,O,U,D.

MOUNT uses M,O,U,T - T is common.

I think SOUND might be better because S is very common.

But let's not use SOUND because S is common, and we can test T instead.

We used S in crane? Crane had S? No, crane is C R A N E - no S.

Letters we have not used: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z we used C,R,A,N,E but N is fixed, so avoid other used letters except we can repeat N? But since it's fixed position, repeating N elsewhere might not be useful.

In feedback, for crane, N was correct, so it's in the word at position 4, and if we guess another position, it might be wrong, but possible.

However, in this case, we are using N only at position 4, so it's fine.

But words like SINEW have E excluded, no.

So SOUND: S O U N D

But it tests S,O,U,D.

MOUNT: M O U N T tests M,O,U,T.

STING: S T I N G tests S,T,I,G.

POINT: P O I N T tests P,O,I,T.

Comparing, all test various.

Perhaps POINT or STING.

I think ""STING"" is a good choice because it uses S,T which are common, and I for vowel.

And avoids O U which we can test later.

Since only 6 tries, we need to be efficient.

Another thought: since N is fixed, the last letter cannot be E because E is out, similarly not C,R,A.

So last letter possibilities: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z etc.

In POINT, last is T, which might indicate if T is present.

Similarly.

I'll go with STING.

STING: S T I N G

Positions: S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)

All letters except N are new and not excluded.

So guess: sting

Formally: STINGBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, and E are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
- N is in the correct position (4th letter is confirmed as ""N"").

The secret word has the form: _ _ _ N _, with letters C, R, A, and E excluded.

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, or E.
- Test new common letters to gather more information, especially focusing on possible vowels (like O, I, U) and consonants like S, T, G.
- Choose a word that fits the pattern _ _ _ N _ to maintain the correct position of ""N"" and ensure all letters are valid.

""STING"" is a suitable choice:
- S, T, I, N, G: All letters except ""N"" are new and not excluded.
- Tests S, T, I, and G while confirming the ""N"" position.
- Provides good coverage: S and T are high-frequency consonants; I is a vowel option since A and E are out.

This guess maximizes potential information gain by covering multiple untested letters.

We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- A: not in word (x)
- N: correct position (✓) at 4th
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: STING
- S: not in word (x)
- T: not in word (x)
- I: not in word (x)
- N: correct position (✓) at 4th
- G: not in word (x)

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The 4th letter is definitely N.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, S, T, I, G.

We also know that the word has the pattern: _ _ _ N _

Now, we need to avoid using the excluded letters: C, R, A, E, S, T, I, G.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but note that N is in the word but already placed, so we can use it only in the 4th position to avoid confusion, but we don't have to use it elsewhere).

We should choose a word that:
- Has the 4th letter as N.
- Uses only the available letters (so no C,R,A,E,S,T,I,G).
- Tests new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tested: O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

We might also consider that the word must have vowels. Since A, E, I are out, the remaining vowels are O and U (and sometimes Y).

So, we should try to include O or U in our guess.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ _ N _ and use only available letters:

Examples:
- BOUND: B O U N D -> uses B,O,U,D (all available) and N at 4th.
- FOUND: F O U N D -> but F is available, O,U,D available. However, we have to check if F is allowed? Yes, not excluded.
- MOUND: M O U N D
- POUND: P O U N D
- HOUND: H O U N D
- WOUND: W O U N D

But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another option: words with O and other consonants, like:
- DONUT: D O N U T -> but T is excluded (from STING feedback, T is not in word). So cannot use T.
- Similarly, we cannot use T.

Also, we cannot use S, I, G, etc.

So, back to the words above: BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, POUND, HOUND, WOUND.

These all have O and U, which are vowels we haven't tested.

We could also consider words with Y, like:
- DOWNY: D O W N Y -> but is DOWNY a word? Not really, downy is D-O-W-N-Y, meaning covered with down, but that's 5 letters? D-O-W-N-Y is 5 letters. But let's see if it fits: positions 1:D, 2:O, 3:W, 4:N, 5:Y. And Y can be a vowel.

But DOWNY might not be very common, and we have better options.

Another word: MONEY: M O N E Y -> but E is excluded, so invalid.

Similarly, BONEY: B O N E Y -> E excluded.

So, the HOUND type words are good.

We could also try: JOINT, but J is less common and I is excluded? JOINT has I, which is excluded. So no.

Another idea: BLOWN: B L O W N -> positions: B(1), L(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> but N is at 5th, not 4th. We need N at 4th.

So not.

We need the 4th to be N.

So, let's stick with the words like POUND, MOUND, etc.

Now, which one to choose? We can pick one that uses less common letters to test, but since we have many options, we might choose one that has letters that are more frequent.

For example, POUND: P, O, U, N, D. P and D are common.

Similarly, MOUND: M, O, U, N, D.

HOUND: H, O, U, N, D.

WOUND: W, O, U, N, D.

BOUND: B, O, U, N, D.

FOUND: F, O, U, N, D.

All are similar. We can choose POUND because P is a common consonant.

But note: we haven't tested P, O, U, D, etc.

Another thought: we might want to avoid using two vowels (O and U) in one guess to test more consonants? But we need to find the word, so testing multiple vowels might be efficient if we suspect a vowel is present.

Since we have no vowels confirmed (only N, a consonant), and A,E,I are out, the word must have O or U or Y as a vowel.

So testing both O and U in one word is efficient because:
- If we get a match for O or U, we know which vowel is present.
- If both are absent, then the word must have Y as a vowel.

So, a word with O and U is good for this purpose.

Therefore, I think POUND is a reasonable guess.

But let's confirm: POUND uses P, O, U, N, D. None of these are excluded (excluded: C,R,A,E,S,T,I,G). So all are allowed.

Pattern: P O U N D -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:D.

We are testing P at position 1, O at 2, U at 3, and D at 5.

This should give us good information.

We could also consider MOUND or FOUND, but POUND is fine.

Another option: if we want to test Y, we could try a word like FUNKY: F U N K Y -> but N is at position 3, not 4. We need N at 4.

Or PLUMB: P L U M B -> no N at all? We must have N at 4, so not.

So, I think POUND is a solid choice.

Therefore, the next guess is POUND.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- The 4th letter is confirmed as ""N"" (from both guesses).
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, E, S, T, I, G (all marked ""x"" in feedback).
- The word pattern is: _ _ _ N _

For the next guess:
- Must avoid excluded letters and maintain ""N"" in the 4th position.
- Focus on testing new common letters, especially vowels (O, U) since A, E, I are out, and consonants like P, D, M, B.
- ""POUND"" is a suitable choice:
  - Fits the pattern: P (position 1), O (position 2), U (position 3), N (position 4), D (position 5).
  - Tests new high-frequency letters: P, O, U, D.
  - Efficiently checks for vowel presence (O or U) since Y is the only other vowel option if both are absent.

This guess maximizes information gain by covering multiple untested letters while adhering to constraints.

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: not in word (x)

- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: STING
- S: not in word (x)
- T: not in word (x)
- I: not in word (x)
- N: correct position (✓) at 4th
- G: not in word (x)

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The 4th letter is definitely N.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, S, T, I, G.

We also know that the word has the pattern: _ _ _ N _

Now, we need to avoid using the excluded letters: C, R, A, E, S, T, I, G.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but note that N is in the word but already placed, so we can use it only in the 4th position to avoid confusion, but we don't have to use it elsewhere).

We should choose a word that:
- Has the 4th letter as N.
- Uses only the available letters (so no C,R,A,E,S,T,I,G).
- Tests new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tested: O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

- BOUND: B O U N D -> uses B,O,U,D (all available) and N at 4th.
- FOUND: F O U N D -> but F is available, O,U,D available. However, we have to check if F is allowed? Yes, not excluded.
- MOUND: M O U N D
- POUND: P O U N D
- HOUND: H O U N D
- WOUND: W O U N D

But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another option: words with O and other consonants, like:
- DONUT: D O N U T -> but T is excluded (from STING feedback, T is not in word). So cannot use T.
- Similarly, we cannot use T.

Also, we cannot use S, I, G, etc.

So, back to the words above: BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, POUND, HOUND, WOUND.

These all have O and U, which are vowels we haven't tested.

We could also consider words with Y, like:
- DOWNY: D O W N Y -> but is DOWNY a word? Not really, downy is D-O-W-N-Y, meaning covered with down, but that's 5 letters? D-O-W-N-Y is 5 letters. But let's see if it fits: positions 1:D, 2:O, 3:W, 4:N, 5:Y. And Y can be a vowel.

But DOWNY might not be very common, and we have better options.

Another word: MONEY: M O N E Y -> but E is excluded, so invalid.

Similarly, BONEY: B O N E Y -> E excluded.

So, the HOUND type words are good.

We could also try: JOINT, but J is less common and I is excluded? JOINT has I, which is excluded. So no.

Another idea: BLOWN: B L O W N -> positions: B(1), L(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> but N is at 5th, not 4th. We need N at 4th.

So not.

We need the 4th to be N.

So, let's stick with the words like POUND, MOUND, etc.

Now, which one to choose? We can pick one that uses less common letters to test, but since we have many options, we might choose one that has letters that are more frequent.

For example, POUND: P, O, U, N, D. P and D are common.

Similarly, MOUND: M, O, U, N, D.

HOUND: H, O, U, N, D.

WOUND: W, O, U, N, D.

BOUND: B, O, U, N, D.

FOUND: F, O, U, N, D.

All are similar. We can choose POUND because P is a common consonant.

But note: we haven't tested P, O, U, D, etc.

Another thought: we might want to avoid using two vowels (O and U) in one guess to test more consonants? But we need to find the word, so testing multiple vowels might be efficient if we suspect a vowel is present.

Since we have no vowels confirmed (only N, a consonant), and A,E,I are out, the word must have O or U or Y as a vowel.

So testing both O and U in one word is efficient because:
- If we get a match for O or U, we know which vowel is present.
- If both are absent, then the word must have Y as a vowel.

So, a word with O and U is good for this purpose.

Therefore, I think POUND is a reasonable guess.

But let's confirm: POUND uses P, O, U, N, D. None of these are excluded (excluded: C,R,A,E,S,T,I,G). So all are allowed.

Pattern: P O U N D -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:D.

We are testing P at position 1, O at 2, U at 3, and D at 5.

This should give us good information.

We could also consider MOUND or FOUND, but POUND is fine.

Another option: if we want to test Y, we could try a word like FUNKY: F U N K Y -> but N is at position 3, not 4. We need N at 4.

Or PLUMB: P L U M B -> no N at all? We must have N at 4, so not.

So, I think POUND is a solid choice.

Therefore, the next guess is POUND.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- The 4th letter is confirmed as ""N"" (from both guesses).
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, E, S, T, I, G (all marked ""x"" in feedback).
- The word pattern is: _ _ _ N _

For the next guess:
- Must avoid excluded letters and maintain ""N"" in the 4th position.
- Focus on testing new common letters, especially vowels (O, U) since A, E, I are out, and consonants like P, D, M, B.
- ""POUND"" is a suitable choice:

 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is in the correct position (✓) - meaning N is the 4th letter
- E is not in the word (x)

The secret word has 5 letters. We know that the 4th letter is N.

Letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all. So we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

We need to guess a 5-letter word where:
- The 4th letter is N.
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.

Possible letters: We need to consider letters that are not excluded. Since only C,R,A,E are excluded, the rest of the alphabet is available, but we should focus on common letters.

The word structure so far: _ _ _ N _

We need to fill the first three positions and the last position with letters that are not C,R,A,E.

Common consonants and vowels to consider: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But vowels are important: Remaining vowels could be I,O,U (since A and E are out). Also, Y sometimes acts as a vowel.

Good strategy: Pick a word that tests new common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Possible words ending with N in the 4th position? Actually, the N is in the 4th position, so the word is like _ _ _ N _, with the last letter unknown.

We should use words with high-frequency letters we haven't tested yet.

Letters not tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We used C,R,A,N,E in the first guess, but N is confirmed, so avoid C,R,A,E.

Common letters to test: S, T, L, O, etc.

A good next guess might be something like ""POINT"" but wait, ""POINT"" has P,O,I,N,T. N is in the 4th position? Let's see:
P O I N T -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T

In ""POINT"", N is indeed the 4th letter, which matches.

But we need to ensure we don't use excluded letters. POINT uses P,O,I,N,T. None of these are C,R,A,E, so it should be fine.

POINT contains I and O, which are vowels we haven't tested.

Other options: We could try words like ""JOINT"", ""MOINT"" isn't a word. ""MOUNT"" has U and T, but U is not tested. However, ""MOUNT"" has U, and N is 4th? M O U N T -> 4th is N, yes. But does it have excluded letters? M,O,U,N,T - no C,R,A,E, so okay. But ""POINT"" seems more common.

""SLING"" - S,L,I,N,G. But N is 4th? S L I N G -> 1:S,2:L,3:I,4:N,5:G - yes, position 4 is N.

But G is the last letter, not tested.

Another possibility: ""BLIND"" - B,L,I,N,D -> positions:1:B,2:L,3:I,4:N,5:D.

All new letters except N.

Which one to choose?

Since we have only one letter fixed (N at position 4), we need to maximize information by testing multiple new letters.

""POINT"" uses P,O,I,T (and N known).

""SLING"" uses S,L,I,G (and N).

Both test four new letters.

Similarly, ""BLIND"" uses B,L,I,D.

We might want to test a vowel if possible, since we know A and E are out. Vowels available: I,O,U,Y.

Words with O or I could be good.

Also, avoid repeating letters.

Another common starting word is ""SPOIL"" but here we have constraint that 4th must be N.

So, what about ""SPINE""? S,P,I,N,E but E is excluded! Cannot use E.

Because feedback said E is not in the word.

Similarly, cannot have C,R,A,E.

So ""POINT"" is okay.

Let's confirm the spelling: POINT is a valid word.

Perhaps ""JOINT"" or ""FOINT"" not a word, so POINT is fine.

Other words: ""STING"" has S,T,I,N,G. S T I N G -> position 4 is N? Let's count: S(1),T(2),I(3),N(4),G(5) - yes.

Similarly, ""STING"" uses, S,T,I,G - all new except N.

Compared with POINT: both test different sets.

Since R and A are out, and S is common, perhaps STING is good.

STING contains I, which might help with vowels.

Similarly, ""SWING"" could be, but W is less common.

To cover more vowel possibilities, testing O or U might help.

But in POINT, we have O, which is a vowel not yet tested.

In STING, we have I, a vowel.

Both similar.

Perhaps ""POINT"" is slightly better? Or ""TUNIC"" but T U N I C has C which is excluded, invalid.

Cannot use C.

""LUNCH"" has C, excluded.

So, back to POINT or STING.

Another idea: ""NOISY"" N O I S Y - N is the first letter, not fourth. We need N as fourth.

So position must be _ _ _ N _

The word must have N as the fourth letter.

So words ending in N? No, fourth letter N means the word is prefix + 4th:N + suffix.

For example: ??N? like in BLINd, POINt, STINg, etc.

Also, MINTS - M I N T S, but 4th letter? M(1),I(2),N(3),T(4),S(5) - position 3 is N, not 4. Wrong.

Fourth position means after three letters, the fourth is N.

Similarly, ""BONUS"" - B O N U S - positions: B(1),O(2),N(3),U(4),S(5) so N is third, not fourth.

So not applicable.

""PLAIN"" P L A I N - has A excluded, and N is fifth, position: P(1),L(2),A(3),I(4),N(5) - fourth is I, not N.

We need fourth position N.

Examples: BEGIN - B E G I N - E excluded, and N is fifth.

""CHAIN"" C and A excluded, no.

""TRAIN"" - T R A I N - R and A excluded.

""STAIN"" - S T A I N - A excluded.

""PLANE"" - P L A N E - A and E excluded.

So POINT is good.

Other options: JOINT, POINT, MOUNT (M O U N T), FAINT has A excluded, PAINT has A excluded, QUINT has Q which is rare, but valid? QUINT is a word? Quint means five, could be.

But POINT is more common.

HINT - H I N T, but H I N T is 4 letters? No, HINT has 4 letters, we need 5 letters.

All words must be 5 letters.

So POINT: P-O-I-N-T

MOUNT: M-O-U-N-T

JOINT: J-O-I-N-T - J is less common.

OINT isn't a root, but JOINT is fine.

""MINDS"" M I N D S - positions: M(1),I(2),N(3),D(4),S(5) - N is third, not fourth.

To have fourth letter: the word pattern is XXXNX, where X are letters to guess.

XXXN_ 

And last letter also.

So perhaps ""ADMIN"" has A and I, A excluded.

""BEGIN"" B E G I N - E excluded.

""BRAIN"" B R A I N - R and A excluded.

So reasonable options: POINT, MOUNT, STING, SLING, etc.

STING: S T I N G - positions: S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) - perfect, N is fourth.

Similarly, SWING, STING, etc.

BLIND: B L I N D - B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) - also good.

Among these, let's choose one that tests more common letters and tries a different vowel from what we excluded.

We excluded A,E, so test O or U or I.

POINT tests O and I.

STING tests I.

BLIND tests I.

MOUNT tests O and U.

MOUNT: M-O-U-N-T

U is a vowel that might be important.

Since we have N fixed, testing U could be useful.

I think any of these are fine, but let's go with MOUNT to test U and O.

Or POINT to test O.

Perhaps STING is good because S and T are common.

I recall that in Wordle, it's good to try multiple vowels.

Since we have I available in many, MOUNT has O and U.

BLUND has B,L,U,N,D but U is vowel, and BLUND isn't a word; it's BLU N D? Not 5 letters.

BLIND only has I.

WORD: W O R D - 4 letters.

So MOUNT seems solid.

Another word: ""COUNT"" C O U N T - C excluded? C is excluded from first feedback.

C is not in word, so cannot use C. COUNT contains C.

Similarly, ""FOUND"" F O U N D - excludes C,R,A,E, fine.

F O U N D - positions: F(1),O(2),U(3),N(4),D(5) - N is fourth.

Good, FOUND is another option.

But it has U and O both.

Similarly, MOUNT, POUND, SOUND, etc.

But SOUND: S O U N D - same as found, S O U N D.

SOUND uses S,O,U,D - all new except N.

Similarly, FOUND uses F,O,U,D.

MOUNT uses M,O,U,T - T is common.

I think SOUND might be better because S is very common.

But let's not use SOUND because S is common, and we can test T instead.

We used S in crane? Crane had S? No, crane is C R A N E - no S.

Letters we have not used: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z we used C,R,A,N,E but N is fixed, so avoid other used letters except we can repeat N? But since it's fixed position, repeating N elsewhere might not be useful.

In feedback, for crane, N was correct, so it's in the word at position 4, and if we guess another position, it might be wrong, but possible.

However, in this case, we are using N only at position 4, so it's fine.

But words like SINEW have E excluded, no.

So SOUND: S O U N D

But it tests S,O,U,D.

MOUNT: M O U N T tests M,O,U,T.

STING: S T I N G tests S,T,I,G.

POINT: P O I N T tests P,O,I,T.

Comparing, all test various.

Perhaps POINT or STING.

I think ""STING"" is a good choice because it uses S,T which are common, and I for vowel.

And avoids O U which we can test later.

Since only 6 tries, we need to be efficient.

Another thought: since N is fixed, the last letter cannot be E because E is out, similarly not C,R,A.

So last letter possibilities: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z etc.

In POINT, last is T, which might indicate if T is present.

Similarly.

I'll go with STING.

STING: S T I N G

Positions: S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)

All letters except N are new and not excluded.

So guess: sting

Formally: STINGBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, and E are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
- N is in the correct position (4th letter is confirmed as ""N"").

The secret word has the form: _ _ _ N _, with letters C, R, A, and E excluded.

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, or E.
- Test new common letters to gather more information, especially focusing on possible vowels (like O, I, U) and consonants like S, T, G.
- Choose a word that fits the pattern _ _ _ N _ to maintain the correct position of ""N"" and ensure all letters are valid.

""STING"" is a suitable choice:
- S, T, I, N, G: All letters except ""N"" are new and not excluded.
- Tests S, T, I, and G while confirming the ""N"" position.
- Provides good coverage: S and T are high-frequency consonants; I is a vowel option since A and E are out.

This guess maximizes potential information gain by covering multiple untested letters.

<guess>sting</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: sting -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) I(x) N(✓) G(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- A: not in word (x)
- N: correct position (✓) at 4th
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: STING
- S: not in word (x)
- T: not in word (x)
- I: not in word (x)
- N: correct position (✓) at 4th
- G: not in word (x)

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The 4th letter is definitely N.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, S, T, I, G.

We also know that the word has the pattern: _ _ _ N _

Now, we need to avoid using the excluded letters: C, R, A, E, S, T, I, G.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but note that N is in the word but already placed, so we can use it only in the 4th position to avoid confusion, but we don't have to use it elsewhere).

We should choose a word that:
- Has the 4th letter as N.
- Uses only the available letters (so no C,R,A,E,S,T,I,G).
- Tests new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tested: O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

We might also consider that the word must have vowels. Since A, E, I are out, the remaining vowels are O and U (and sometimes Y).

So, we should try to include O or U in our guess.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ _ N _ and use only available letters:

Examples:
- BOUND: B O U N D -> uses B,O,U,D (all available) and N at 4th.
- FOUND: F O U N D -> but F is available, O,U,D available. However, we have to check if F is allowed? Yes, not excluded.
- MOUND: M O U N D
- POUND: P O U N D
- HOUND: H O U N D
- WOUND: W O U N D

But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another option: words with O and other consonants, like:
- DONUT: D O N U T -> but T is excluded (from STING feedback, T is not in word). So cannot use T.
- Similarly, we cannot use T.

Also, we cannot use S, I, G, etc.

So, back to the words above: BOUND, FOUND, MOUND, POUND, HOUND, WOUND.

These all have O and U, which are vowels we haven't tested.

We could also consider words with Y, like:
- DOWNY: D O W N Y -> but is DOWNY a word? Not really, downy is D-O-W-N-Y, meaning covered with down, but that's 5 letters? D-O-W-N-Y is 5 letters. But let's see if it fits: positions 1:D, 2:O, 3:W, 4:N, 5:Y. And Y can be a vowel.

But DOWNY might not be very common, and we have better options.

Another word: MONEY: M O N E Y -> but E is excluded, so invalid.

Similarly, BONEY: B O N E Y -> E excluded.

So, the HOUND type words are good.

We could also try: JOINT, but J is less common and I is excluded? JOINT has I, which is excluded. So no.

Another idea: BLOWN: B L O W N -> positions: B(1), L(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> but N is at 5th, not 4th. We need N at 4th.

So not.

We need the 4th to be N.

So, let's stick with the words like POUND, MOUND, etc.

Now, which one to choose? We can pick one that uses less common letters to test, but since we have many options, we might choose one that has letters that are more frequent.

For example, POUND: P, O, U, N, D. P and D are common.

Similarly, MOUND: M, O, U, N, D.

HOUND: H, O, U, N, D.

WOUND: W, O, U, N, D.

BOUND: B, O, U, N, D.

FOUND: F, O, U, N, D.

All are similar. We can choose POUND because P is a common consonant.

But note: we haven't tested P, O, U, D, etc.

Another thought: we might want to avoid using two vowels (O and U) in one guess to test more consonants? But we need to find the word, so testing multiple vowels might be efficient if we suspect a vowel is present.

Since we have no vowels confirmed (only N, a consonant), and A,E,I are out, the word must have O or U or Y as a vowel.

So testing both O and U in one word is efficient because:
- If we get a match for O or U, we know which vowel is present.
- If both are absent, then the word must have Y as a vowel.

So, a word with O and U is good for this purpose.

Therefore, I think POUND is a reasonable guess.

But let's confirm: POUND uses P, O, U, N, D. None of these are excluded (excluded: C,R,A,E,S,T,I,G). So all are allowed.

Pattern: P O U N D -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:D.

We are testing P at position 1, O at 2, U at 3, and D at 5.

This should give us good information.

We could also consider MOUND or FOUND, but POUND is fine.

Another option: if we want to test Y, we could try a word like FUNKY: F U N K Y -> but N is at position 3, not 4. We need N at 4.

Or PLUMB: P L U M B -> no N at all? We must have N at 4, so not.

So, I think POUND is a solid choice.

Therefore, the next guess is POUND.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- The 4th letter is confirmed as ""N"" (from both guesses).
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, E, S, T, I, G (all marked ""x"" in feedback).
- The word pattern is: _ _ _ N _

For the next guess:
- Must avoid excluded letters and maintain ""N"" in the 4th position.
- Focus on testing new common letters, especially vowels (O, U) since A, E, I are out, and consonants like P, D, M, B.
- ""POUND"" is a suitable choice:
  - Fits the pattern: P (position 1), O (position 2), U (position 3), N (position 4), D (position 5).
  - Tests new high-frequency letters: P, O, U, D.
  - Efficiently checks for vowel presence (O or U) since Y is the only other vowel option if both are absent.

This guess maximizes information gain by covering multiple untested letters while adhering to constraints.

JOINT has I, which is excluded. So no.\n\nAnother idea: BLOWN: B L O W N -> positions: B(1), L(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> but N is at 5th, not 4th. We need N at 4th.\n\nSo not.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N.\n\nSo, let\'s stick with the words like POUND, MOUND, etc.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We can pick one that uses less common letters to test, but since we have many options, we might choose one that has letters that are more frequent.\n\nFor example, POUND: P, O, U, N, D. P and D are common.\n\nSimilarly, MOUND: M, O, U, N, D.\n\nHOUND: H, O, U, N, D.\n\nWOUND: W, O, U, N, D.\n\nBOUND: B, O, U, N, D.\n\nFOUND: F, O, U, N, D.\n\nAll are similar. We can choose POUND because P is a common consonant.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested P, O, U, D, etc.\n\nAnother thought: we might want to avoid using two vowels (O and U) in one guess to test more consonants? But we need to find the word, so testing multiple vowels might be efficient if we suspect a vowel is present.\n\nSince we have no vowels confirmed (only N, a consonant), and A,E,I are out, the word must have O or U or Y as a vowel.\n\nSo testing both O and U in one word is efficient because:\n- If we get a match for O or U, we know which vowel is present.\n- If both are absent, then the word must have Y as a vowel.\n\nSo, a word with O and U is good for this purpose.\n\nTherefore, I think POUND is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: POUND uses P, O, U, N, D. None of these are excluded (excluded: C,R,A,E,S,T,I,G). So all are allowed.\n\nPattern: P O U N D -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:D.\n\nWe are testing P at position 1, O at 2, U at 3, and D at 5.\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nWe could also consider MOUND or FOUND, but POUND is fine.\n\nAnother option: if we want to test Y, we could try a word like FUNKY: F U N K Y -> but N is at position 3, not 4. We need N at 4.\n\nOr PLUMB: P L U M B -> no N at all? We must have N at 4, so not.\n\nSo, I think POUND is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is POUND.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- The 4th letter is confirmed as ""N"" (from both guesses).\n- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, E, S, T, I, G (all marked ""x"" in feedback).\n- The word pattern is: _ _ _ N _\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must avoid excluded letters and maintain ""N"" in the 4th position.\n- Focus on testing new common letters, especially vowels (O, U) since A, E, I are out, and consonants like P, D, M, B.\n- ""POUND"" is a suitable choice:\n  - Fits the pattern: P (position 1), O (position 2), U (position 3), N (position 4), D (position 5).\n  - Tests new high-frequency letters: P, O, U, D.\n  - Efficiently checks for vowel presence (O or U) since Y is the only other vowel option if both are absent.\n\nThis guess maximizes information gain by covering multiple untested letters while adhering to constraints.\n\n<guess>pound</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: sting -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) I(x) N(✓) G(x)\nGuess 3: pound -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).  
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: STING -> S(x), T(x), I(x), N(✓), G(x)  
  - N is still in the 4th position.  
  - S, T, I, G are not in the word.

Guess 3: POUND -> P(x), O(✓), U(✓), N(✓), D(✓)  
  - O is in the correct position (2nd letter).  
  - U is in the correct position (3rd letter).  
  - N is in the correct position (4th letter).  
  - D is in the correct position (5th letter).  
  - P is not in the word.

From this feedback, we can conclude:
- The word has the form: _ O _ _ _ ?  
  Wait, no: from POUND feedback:
  - O(✓) at position 2: so 2nd letter is O.
  - U(✓) at position 3: so 3rd letter is U.
  - N(✓) at position 4: so 4th letter is N.
  - D(✓) at position 5: so 5th letter is D.

Therefore, the word is: ? O U N D

The first letter is unknown, but we know:
- From previous exclusions, the first letter cannot be: C, R, A, E, S, T, I, G, P (all marked as not present).
- Also, we have O, U, N, D in positions 2,3,4,5 and confirmed correct, so they can appear only there? Actually, since they are all marked correct and in position, it means no duplicates unless otherwise, but the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates. However, since they are fixed, we don't need to worry about duplicates for these.

Now, the word structure: First letter + ""OUND""

Known exclusions for the first letter: C, R, A, E, S, T, I, G, P.

We need to find a 5-letter word ending with ""OUND"", but not starting with any excluded letter.

Common words with ""OUND"": 
- FOUND: starts with F
- HOUND: starts with H
- MOUND: starts with M
- WOUND: starts with W
- BOUND: starts with B
- SOUND: starts with S, but S is excluded (from STING), so S is out.

POUND we guessed, and P is excluded, so not P.

Now, FOUND: F is possible? We haven't tested F, so it could be.
Similarly, H, M, W, B are all untested.

We must choose a word that fits: ?OUND where ? is a letter not excluded.

Possible letters: B, F, H, M, W (since they form words: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND). There might be others, like GROUND but G is excluded (from STING), so no.

Similarly, ROUND has R, excluded. PROWND is not a word.

So, the possible guesses are among: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND.

But note: we only have one letter unknown, so we don't need to test more? We can guess one of these.

However, we have 6 tries, and we are on guess 4. We can directly guess one.

But let's see: we can use the guess to confirm.

Actually, since only the first letter is missing, and we know it must be one of B, F, H, M, W, we can pick one.

But in the context, we don't know which one. However, we can try to see if we can get it in one guess.

Alternatively, if we want to be efficient, we can try a word that contains multiple possibilities? No, because the word is fixed as ?OUND.

We have to guess one of these five: B, F, H, M, W for the first letter.

We can choose arbitrarily, but let's pick one that uses an untested letter? We haven't tested any of these, so any guess will test one.

We might as well guess one.

But perhaps we can use a word that isn't ?OUND but tests the first position? But no, because we know the last four letters are fixed as O, U, N, D.

Therefore, the secret word must be one of these: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND.

We can eliminate some? Not really, because we have no information on B,F,H,M,W.

So, we should choose one.

Since we are on guess 4, we can pick, say, HOUND as a guess.

Or FOUND? Let's see common words.

In English, FOUND (past tense of find) is common, HOUND (dog) is common, WOUND (injury) is common, etc.

We have to pick one.

Let me pick FOUND.

But FOUND uses F, which we haven't encountered.

Similarly.

Perhaps we can think: we want to maximize information? But in this case, whatever we pick, if wrong, we get the exact position of the wrong letter? No.

Actually, because the last four letters are fixed, if the whole word is correct, we win. If not, then the first letter is wrong, but we still know it's not that letter, and the others are correct.

But since there are multiple possibilities, if we guess FOUND and it's wrong, we get feedback that D is correct? But D is already in position 5, and in FOUND, D is at 5, so D should be correct? Actually, all positions are set.

For example, if we guess FOUND:
- Positions: F(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5)
- We expect O,U,N,D to be correct, so they will show ✓.
- For F: if F is in the word and correct, ✓; otherwise x or maybe -, but since it's at position 1.

But if the secret word is HOUND, then F is not in word? But HOUND has H at 1, so F might not be present.

So, feedback:
- F at position 1: if in word? But secret word has H at 1? So F is not in word, so F will be x? But it could be present elsewhere, but unlikely.

Since F is not in any of the other possibilities? BOUND has B, FOUND has F, HOUND has H, etc. Each word has different starting letter.

Therefore, if we guess FOUND and secret is FOUND, all ✓.

If secret is HOUND, then:
- F: not in word (x), since HOUND has no F.
- O,U,N,D: all ✓ (same positions).

Similarly for others.

So, we can guess and eliminate.

We can guess FOUND first: if correct, great; if not, then we know the first letter is not F, so it must be one of the remaining.

We have 3 tries left after this, but only one to solve.

But we might solve it in this guess.

Since no other information, we can choose FOUND because F is a common consonant.

Alternatively, to avoid a possible wrong guess? But we have to guess one.

Perhaps we should use a word that isn't a ?OUND word? But that would not take advantage of the known positions.

For example, if we guess a word like JUMAN using J,U,N, etc.? But that ignores that we know last four are OUND.

So it would be inefficient; we should use the known pattern.

Therefore, we guess FOUND.

But let's confirm the word: FOUND is 5 letters, meaning ""to establish"" or past tense of find.

Yes.

So, next guess: FOUND

However, we must ensure: is there any exclusion? We have not excluded F, so yes.

Similarly, B, H, M, W are also possible.

But we go with FOUND.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **CRANE**: Excluded C, R, A, E; confirmed N in the 4th position (✓).
- **STING**: Excluded S, T, I, G; confirmed N in the 4th position (✓).
- **POUND**: Excluded P; confirmed O in the 2nd position (✓), U in the 3rd position (✓), N in the 4th position (✓), and D in the 5th position (✓).

From this, we derive:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ O U N D` (first letter unknown, positions 2–5 confirmed).
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, A, E, S, T, I, G, P.
- Possible candidates for the secret word are common 5-letter words ending in ""OUND"", such as BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, or WOUND (since SOUND is invalid due to S being excluded).

For the next guess:
- We must use the confirmed pattern `_ O U N D`.
- Focus on testing possible first letters from the candidate list: B, F, H, M, W (all untested and not excluded).
- Choose one arbitrarily to narrow down the options—**FOUND** is selected because it tests F (a common untested consonant) and directly addresses the pattern.

<guess>found</guess>",found,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).  
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: STING -> S(x), T(x), I(x), N(✓), G(x)  
  - N is still in the 4th position.  
  - S, T, I, G are not in the word.

Guess 3: POUND -> P(x), O(✓), U(✓), N(✓), D(✓)  
  - O is in the correct position (2nd letter).  
  - U is in the correct position (3rd letter).  
  - N is in the correct position (4th letter).  
  - D is in the correct position (5th letter).  
  - P is not in the word.

From this feedback, we can conclude:
- The word has the form: _ O _ _ _ ?  
  Wait, no: from POUND feedback:
  - O(✓) at position 2: so 2nd letter is O.
  - U(✓) at position 3: so 3rd letter is U.
  - N(✓) at position 4: so 4th letter is N.
  - D(✓) at position 5: so 5th letter is D.

Therefore, the word is: ? O U N D

The first letter is unknown, but we know:
- From previous exclusions, the first letter cannot be: C, R, A, E, S, T, I, G, P (all marked as not present).
- Also, we have O, U, N, D in positions 2,3,4,5 and confirmed correct, so they can appear only there? Actually, since they are all marked correct and in position, it means no duplicates unless otherwise, but the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates. However, since they are fixed, we don't need to worry about duplicates for these.

Now, the word structure: First letter + ""OUND""

Known exclusions for the first letter: C, R, A, E, S, T, I, G, P.

We need to find a 5-letter word ending with ""OUND"", but not starting with any excluded letter.

Common words with ""OUND"": 
- FOUND: starts with F
- HOUND: starts with H
- MOUND: starts with M
- WOUND: starts with W
- BOUND: starts with B
- SOUND: starts with S, but S is excluded (from STING), so S is out.

POUND we guessed, and P is excluded, so not P.

Now, FOUND: F is possible? We haven't tested F, so it could be.
Similarly, H, M, W, B are all untested.

We must choose a word that fits: ?OUND where ? is a letter not excluded.

Possible letters: B, F, H, M, W (since they form words: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND). There might be others, like GROUND but G is excluded (from STING), so no.

Similarly, ROUND has R, excluded. PROWND is not a word.

So, the possible guesses are among: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND.
