We are starting the game. On the first guess, we have no prior feedback, so we need a strategic starting word.
 A good starting word should:
   - Have 5 distinct letters to maximize coverage of possibilities.
   - Include common vowels and consonants.

 The word ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because:
   - It contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N).
   - It avoids repeating letters.

 Alternatives like ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", or ""RAISE"" are also common. But ""CRANE"" is a solid choice.

 Let's pick ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

 However, note that the game expects a valid English 5-letter word.

 After consideration, I choose: CRANE

 But wait, let me double-check: C-R-A-N-E. It's a valid word.

 Therefore, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

Starting with a strategic first guess is key. A good starting word includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information. ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), and all letters are distinct. This helps test a wide range of possibilities early.

Alright, let me tackle this Wordle puzzle step by step. With the first guess ""RAISE"" giving feedback R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-), I need to analyze what this tells us about the secret word.

First, I break down the feedback:
- R and E are present but in the wrong positions. So R is in the word, but not the first letter, and E is in the word but not the last letter.
- A, I, and S are absent from the word entirely. That means none of these three letters appear anywhere in the secret word.

Considering the missing letters A, I, S are vowels or common consonants, I should look for words without these. Since R and E are in the word but misplaced, I need a word that includes R and E but in different positions.

Possible positions for R and E: Since R wasn't first and E wasn't last, R could be in positions 2–5, but not 1; similarly E could be in 1–4, but not 5. 

Given that, I brainstorm words containing R and E, excluding A, I, S. Common examples could be words like ""BERYL"" or ""PERKY,"" but those might have other constraints. Since I have limited attempts, I want to maximize new letter coverage.

""BERYL"" includes B, Y, L—all new letters—and places R and E differently than ""RAISE."" Specifically, in ""BERYL,"" R is third and E is second, which avoids the first and last positions and tests new spots. Plus, it avoids repeating the excluded letters.

I also consider ""CRWTH"" but that's obscure and missing vowels. A better candidate is ""PERKY,"" which has P, K, Y—new letters—and E and R. However, ""PERKY"" contains K and Y, which are less common, but valid.

Between ""BERYL"" and ""PERKY,"" ""BERYL"" introduces B, Y, L—all untested—and gives new positional insights for R and E. Since the secret word has five letters without A, I, S, ""BERYL"" meets this criteria.

Finalizing, guessing ""BERYL"" efficiently tests new letters while accounting for the constraints from Feedback 1.
</think>
Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (RAISE → R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)):

### Analysis:
1. **Confirmed letters**: 
   - **R** and **E** are in the secret word (*but not in positions 1 or 5*).
2. **Excluded letters**: 
   - **A**, **I**, and **S** are *not* in the word at any position.
3. **Constraints**:
   - The word must contain **R** and **E**, exclude A/I/S, and reposition R (not 1st) and E (not 5th).

### Strategy for Guess 2:
- Test new common letters (e.g., consonants like L, Y, B) while placing R and E in new positions.
- Avoid recycled letters from Feedback 1's misses (A/I/S).
- Prioritize words with **E** not at the end, and **R** not at the start.

Optimal next guess: **BERYL**  
- **B**, **Y**, **L** → New untested letters.  
- **E** → Position 2 (not 5, avoiding original error).  
- **R** → Position 4 (not 1).

We have two guesses and their corresponding feedback:

Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
This means:
- R is in the word, but not in the first position.
- A is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

So from guess 1, we know:
- The word contains R and E, but excludes A, I, S.
- R is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.

Guess 2: BERYL -> Feedback: B(✓) E(✓) R(✓) Y(x) L(x)
This means:
- B is in the correct position (position 1).
- E is in the correct position (position 2).
- R is in the correct position (position 3).
- Y is not in the word at all.
- L is not in the word at all.

So from guess 2, we know:
- The first three letters of the word are B, E, R. So the word starts with ""BER"".
- Y and L are not in the word.

Additionally, we have excluded letters: A, I, S, Y, L.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so the last two positions (4 and 5) are missing.

Let's recap:
- The word is ""B E R _ _""
- Excluded letters: A, I, S, Y, L (and any other letters not yet guessed, but we have only used R,A,I,S,E,B,Y,L so far).
- We have confirmed the presence of B, E, R (and they are fixed in positions 1,2,3).

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""BER"" and does not contain A, I, S, Y, L.

What common words fit this pattern?
Think of words that start with ""BER"". Some possibilities:
- BERET (but E is already in position 2, so ET? But we have two positions: 4 and 5)
- BERET: positions 4=E, 5=T -> but we need to check if T is allowed? We haven't used T yet.
- BERRY: but R is already in position 3 and we have Y which is excluded? Y is out, so BERRY has two R's? Wait, guess 2 had BERYL which had Y and L excluded, but R? In guess 2, R is at position 3, and the word is ""BER"", so if it were BERRY, then the fourth letter would be R. But in guess 2, we had R at position 3, but in the word BERRY, there is another R at position 4? But note that the feedback from guess 2 doesn't tell us about duplicate letters.

Important: The feedback doesn't account for duplicates unless they are in the word. If the secret word has two R's, then if we guess one R correctly, but we might have another R that could get a symbol too.

However, in the secret word we know the first three letters are BER, so if the fourth letter is R, that would be a duplicate R.

But in guess 2 (BERYL), the R was at position 3 and we got it correct (✓). Now, if the secret word has a fourth R, then in the guess BERYL, we only have one R (at position 3), so the feedback would not show information about the fourth R because we didn't guess it.

Similarly, for E: in BER, we have E at position 2 and it's correct. If there is another E? But we don't know.

Now, back to possibilities. We need letters for positions 4 and 5, excluding A,I,S,Y,L.

Also, from guess 1, R and E were present but not at position 1 and 5 respectively. Since in the secret word, E is at position 2, that satisfies being not at 5 (as per guess 1). And R is at position 3, not 1, so that also satisfies.

Now, what letters can we use? The remaining letters of the alphabet minus excluded ones: A, I, S, Y, L are out. Also, we haven't used: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

But we should choose common English words.

Common ""BER"" words:
- BERET: positions 4=E, 5=T. But wait, E is already in the word? The feedback from guess 1 said E is in the word but not at position 5, which is fine since E is at position 2. However, if we have another E at position 4, that's possible? We don't have any feedback saying that E cannot be at position 4. In fact, guess 1 had E at position 5? But wait, guess 1 was RAISE, which had E at position 5, and it was marked as wrong position (-), meaning E is in the word but not at 5. So having E at position 4 is allowed.

But note: if the word is BERET, then what about letter T? We don't know if T is excluded or not.

Similarly, another word: BERTH: BER + T and H? Positions 4=T, 5=H.

Or BERGS: BER + G and S? But S is excluded, so no.

BERKS: BER + K and S? But S excluded.

BERME: but E at position 4? And M, but E again? Also, we have to see.

List of common ""BER__"" words:

- BERET (E and T)
- BERTH (T and H)
- BERGS (G and S) -> S excluded, invalid
- BERKS (K and S) -> S excluded, invalid
- BERMS (M and S) -> S excluded, invalid
- BEROB (O and B) -> B? But B is already in first position? But duplicate B? We don't know, but B is not excluded? But the word BEROB: positions 4=O, 5=B. Now, B would be at position 5? But we have B at position 1, so a duplicate B? The feedback so far doesn't indicate anything about duplicates.

But let's see: in guess 1, we had R and only one R, but the secret might have duplicates. Similarly for E or B.

However, BEROB is less common, perhaps not the word.

Another word: BERAY? But Y is excluded.

BERKY? But Y excluded.

So likely candidates: BERET, BERTH, BERME? BERME is a word? It means a slope. Also, BERGS is invalid because S is excluded.

What about BERYL? But we already guessed that and it was not correct (only the first three were correct, not the last two).

In our case, the secret word has BER followed by two letters that are not Y and L (and not A,I,S).

Also, from the feedback of guess 1: E was marked with (-) at position 5, meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. In BERET, E is at position 4, which is not 5, so that's fine. Similarly, R is at position 1 in RAISE? But wait, RAISE had R at position 1? And we got R(-), meaning R is present but not at position 1. In the secret word, R is at position 3, so that's fine.

Now, if BERET is the word, then the last two are E and T.

But wait, in BERET, there are two E's: one at position 2 and one at position 4.

Is that possible? The feedback doesn't prevent that.

How about BERTH? That has T and H.

Similarly, there's BERET and BERTH.

We should try to use letters that we haven't tested to get more information? But at this point, with three fixed letters, and only two unknown, we might be able to guess the word.

But we have 6 tries, so we can try one of these.

Consider BERET: if we guess BERET and it turns out to be correct, great. If not, we get feedback on the E and T.

Similarly, if we guess BERTH.

But note that we have not tested T or H yet.

Also, E has been confirmed at position 2, but if there is another E, that's possible.

But in the feedback from guess 1: RAISE had E at position 5 and we got E(-), meaning E is in the word but not at 5. Now, if the word has E at position 4, then E is present elsewhere, so that is consistent.

Another point: in guess 2 (BERYL), we had E at position 2 and we got ✓, so that's fixed. And R at position 3 ✓.

Now, if the word were BERET, then in guess 2 (BERYL), we have:
- B: correct position (1)
- E: correct (2)
- R: correct (3)
- Y: not present, so marked x
- L: not present, so marked x

Which matches the feedback.

Similarly, for BERTH: same, but Y and L not present.

Now, are there other words?
- BERGY? But Y excluded.
- BERKO? Or BERKS? But S excluded.
- BEROB? O and B, but B is at position 5? But B is used at 1, which might be okay? But BEROB is not common.
- BERME? M and E? So BERME: positions 4=M, 5=E? But position 5 is E? Wait, but in guess 1, E was at position 5 and we got E(-), meaning E is not at position 5? If the word was BERME with E at position 5, that would contradict the feedback from guess 1.

Exactly! So from guess 1: E(-) at position 5 means that E is NOT at position 5 in the secret word. Therefore, we cannot have E at position 5 in any word.

Similarly, R cannot be at position 1.

Therefore, BERME cannot be the word because it ends with E at position 5.

Similarly, let's check others:

- BERET: positions are 1:B, 2:E, 3:R, 4:E, 5:T → E at position 2 and 4, T at 5. Position 5 is T, not E, so okay.

- BERTH: positions 1:B, 2:E, 3:R, 4:T, 5:H → position 5 is H, not E, okay.

- What about BERET and BERTH? Are there others?

Another word: BEREK? But K, however, it's not common. Also, position 4=E, 5=K? E at position 4 is fine, and K at 5.

But BERK is a word? Actually, BERET and BERTH are more common.

Now, we also have the letter E appearing again? But that's possible.

But note: in guess 1, we had E at position 5 marked ""-"" meaning present but not at 5. If the word has E only once at position 2, then that ""-"" in guess 1 is accounted for by position 2. If the word has E at position 4 as well, then the E at position 2 accounts for both? No, the presence is noted regardless.

The key is that the feedback for each position is independent.

But we can have duplicate letters? For example, the secret word could have two E's? But we need to see the frequency.

For BERET: if we assume that, then in guess 1 RAISE, the E at 5 was incorrect position because E is at 2 and 4, but the feedback ""-"" means it is in the word but not at that position, which is true because E is not at 5.

Similarly, for BERTH: there is only one E at position 2, so the E in RAISE (position 5) was incorrect position because E is at position 2.

Same for BERET with two E's: position 2 and 4.

Now, another candidate: BERAY? But Y excluded.

BERY? Not 5 letters.

BEROE? O and E? Position 4=O, 5=E→ E at position 5? But E cannot be at position 5? So not possible.

Similarly, must not have E at position 5.

Therefore, valid options: BERET, BERTH, maybe BERKO? but K and O? BERKO: 4=K, 5=O? No E at 5.

But BERKO is a proper name perhaps? Not ideal.

Another one: BERK? Only 4 letters? No.

BERGS: has S, excluded.

So the most common two: BERET and BERTH.

We should choose one and guess to confirm.

But note: we have only two unknowns and many letters untested, so guessing either will give information.

But a key point: in BERET, the fourth letter is E. If we guess BERET, and if it's wrong, we might get feedback on E at position 4.

Similarly for BERTH.

To maximize information, we could choose a different word that introduces new letters? But since we have three fixed and only two spots, and we want to solve quickly, we can try BERET or BERTH.

But which one? Let's think.

We also have the feedback from guess 1: the word contains R and E. In BERET, there are two E's and one R? BERET has E, R? But R is at position 3. In BERTH: one E, one R.

That's fine.

But let's look at the available letters.

We could also consider a word like BERTy? but Y excluded.

Maybe BERMUDA? too long.

Another word: BERY? not five.

Perhaps BERME? but position 5 E? Not allowed.

So let's go with BERET.

But wait, there's another word: BER? No.

BORED? But starts with B O? Not BER.

No, it has to start with BER.

So, I think BERET is a strong candidate.

But let's double-check feedback compatibility.

If the word is BERET:
- Guess 1: RAISE → R is at position 3 in secret? In RAISE, R is at 1? Secret has R at position 3? So R(-): correct, because not position 1? But it is present.
- A(x) correct, not present
- I(x) correct
- S(x) correct
- E in RAISE at position 5? Secret has E at position 2 and 4? So E is present? Thus E(-): because not at position 5? Correct.

Guess 2: BERYL → B(✓), E(✓), R(✓) correct. Y and L not present? BERET has no Y or L? Correct.

So it fits.

Similarly, BERTH:
- Similar for guess 1 and 2.

Guess 2 for BERTH has Y and L absent, fits.

Both seem possible? How to distinguish?

We don't have information about T or H? They haven't been tested.

So we might need to guess one.

Since both are valid, let's choose BERET because it includes another E? But that's arbitrary.

To be safe, we can guess BERET.

If it is correct, we win. If not, the feedback will tell us.

For example, if we guess BERET and the word is BERTH, then:
- First three letters BER✓ (same)
- Fourth letter E: but in secret BERTH, position 4 is T, so E should be marked 'x' if not present? Or if E is present elsewhere? But in BERET, we have two E's? But if secret is BERTH, it has only one E at position 2.

Let's simulate:

Secret: BERTH

Guess: BERET
- Position 1: B = B → ✓
- Position 2: E = E → ✓
- Position 3: R = R → ✓
- Position 4: E vs T → E is not T, and is E present in secret? Secret has only E at position 2? So E at position 4 should be 'x' because it is not in the word at any other position? Wait, no: the secret BERTH contains E only at position 2? So E at position 4 is not in the word? Or?

In the secret word BERTH: the letters are B,E,R,T,H. E is present once.

In guess BERET: 
- Position 1: B = B → ✓
- Position 2: E = E → ✓
- Position 3: R = R → ✓
- Position 4: E → does this match T? No. Also, is E in the secret word elsewhere? Secret has E only at position 2? Which is already matched? So for position 4, E is not present because the secret E is already accounted for? Or is it?

In Wordle, each letter in the guess is matched to the secret. For duplicate letters, it can be tricky.

Standard rules: if a letter appears multiple times in the guess, each instance is evaluated separately.

For secret BERTH (one E), and guess BERET:
- Position 1: B ✓
- Position 2: E ✓
- Position 3: R ✓
- Position 4: E: this E is not in the secret? Because the secret has only one E at position 2. So since position 2 E was already matched, position 4 E should be marked 'x' as not present.
- Position 5: T: in secret BERTH, T is at position 4? So position 5: T vs H? T vs H: T not equal, and T is in the secret at position 4? So it is present but in wrong position? Therefore, T should be '-'.

But the secret word has T at position 4? And the guess has T at position 5? So T is in the word but at position 4, not 5, so '-' for position 5.

Similarly, E at position 4: since the secret has no E at position 4, and the secret has only one E which is at position 2 (already matched), so E at position 4 should be 'x'.

Therefore the feedback for BERET with secret BERTH would be: B(✓) E(✓) R(✓) E(x) T(-)

But we are guessing BERET, and we don't know the secret.

Alternatively, if the secret was BERET and we guess BERET, it will be all ✓.

To get maximum information, we could guess a word that distinguishes the possibilities.

For example, if we guess a word like BERTH, then:
- If secret is BERTH, all letters correct.
- If secret is BERET, then similarly, we'd have feedback with T not matching? Guess BERTH vs secret BERET:
  Position 1:B ✓,2:E ✓,3:R ✓,4:T vs E? T not E, and T not present in secret BERET? In BERET, the letters are B,E,R,E,T? So T is present at position 5? So:
  - Position 4: T vs E? Mismatch? And T is present in secret? At position 5? So T should be marked '-' because it's in the word but not at position 4?
  - Position 5: H vs T? H not in secret, and secret has T at position 5? So T should be matched? Wait, confusing.

Guess: B E R T H vs Secret: B E R E T?
Secret: B E R E T

Guess: B E R T H
Position 1: B ✓ (matches)
Position 2: E ✓ (matches)
Position 3: R ✓ (matches)
Position 4: T vs E? Mismatch? Is E in secret? There is E at position 4? So T not E? Also, T is present in secret? At position 5? So T in guess position 4 should be marked '-' because T is in secret (at position 5) but not at position 4.
Position 5: H vs T? H not present in secret? Secret has T at position 5? So H should be 'x'? Also, since T at position 5 is already matched by the secret T, but the guess H is nothing.

This is messy.

To avoid complication, since BER__ we have, we can guess BERET.

But there might be another candidate? Is there BER? Only BER something.

Another candidate: BEROW? Not common.

Perhaps we are missing one: BERET and BERTH are the main two.

So I'll go with BERET.

So my next guess is BERET.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: Feedback R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)  
  **Meaning**:  
  - R is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - A, I, S are not in the word.  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2 (BERYL)**: Feedback B(✓), E(✓), R(✓), Y(x), L(x)  
  **Meaning**:  
  - B is correct and in position 1.  
  - E is correct and in position 2.  
  - R is correct and in position 3.  
  - Y and L are not in the word.  

### Deductions:
1. The word starts with ""BER"" (positions 1-3 confirmed).  
2. Positions 4 and 5 are unknown.  
3. **Present letters**: B, E, R.  
4. **Excluded letters**: A, I, S, Y, L (based on feedback).  
5. **Possible letters**: Common remaining letters like T, H, M, N, O, C, D, F, G, K, P, U.  
6. **Constraints**:  
   - E cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 1 feedback).  
   - R cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1 feedback)—already satisfied.  

### Evaluating Possibilities:
- Words starting with ""BER"" and excluding A, I, S, Y, L:  
  - **BERET**: Ends with E and T.  
    - Position 4: E—this would be a second E. Position 5: T. Consistent with E not at position 5.  
    - Not excluded by feedback.  
  - **BERTH**: Ends with T and H.  
    - Position 4: T. Position 5: H.  
    - Also consistent with constraints.  
- Both are common English words fitting the pattern.  
- Other options like BERGS or BERKS are invalid due to excluded S.  

### Optimal Next Guess:
- **BERET** is a strong candidate as it tests for a possible duplicate E (position 4) and introduces T—a new untested letter.  
- If correct, solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on position 4 (E) and 5 (T) will provide valuable information to distinguish **BERTH** or other candidates.

<guess>BERET</guess>",BERET,"We have two guesses and their corresponding feedback:

Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
This means:
- R is in the word, but not in the first position.
- A is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

So from guess 1, we know:
- The word contains R and E, but excludes A, I, S.
- R is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.

Guess 2: BERYL -> Feedback: B(✓) E(✓) R(✓) Y(x) L(x)
This means:
- B is in the correct position (position 1).
- E is in the correct position (position 2).
- R is in the correct position (position 3).
- Y is not in the word at all.
- L is not in the word at all.

So from guess 2, we know:
- The first three letters of the word are B, E, R. So the word starts with ""BER"".
- Y and L are not in the word.

Additionally, we have excluded letters: A, I, S, Y, L.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so the last two positions (4 and 5) are missing.

Let's recap:
- The word is ""B E R _ _""
- Excluded letters: A, I, S, Y, L (and any other letters not yet guessed, but we have only used R,A,I,S,E,B,Y,L so far).
- We have confirmed the presence of B, E, R (and they are fixed in positions 1,2,3).

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""BER"" and does not contain A, I, S, Y, L.

What common words fit this pattern?
Think of words that start with ""BER"". Some possibilities:
- BERET (but E is already in position 2, so ET? But we have two positions: 4 and 5)
- BERET: positions 4=E, 5=T -> but we need to check if T is allowed? We haven't used T yet.
- BERRY: but R is already in position 3 and we have Y which is excluded? Y is out, so BERRY has two R's? Wait, guess 2 had BERYL which had Y and L excluded, but R? In guess 2, R is at position 3, and the word is ""BER"", so if it were BERRY, then the fourth letter would be R. But in guess 2, we had R at position 3, but in the word BERRY, there is another R at position 4? But note that the feedback from guess 2 doesn't tell us about duplicate letters.

Important: The feedback doesn't account for duplicates unless they are in the word. If the secret word has two R's, then if we guess one R correctly, but we might have another R that could get a symbol too.

However, in the secret word we know the first three letters are BER, so if the fourth letter is R, that would be a duplicate R.

But in guess 2 (BERYL), the R was at position 3 and we got it correct (✓). Now, if the secret word has a fourth R, then in the guess BERYL, we only have one R (at position 3), so the feedback would not show information about the fourth R because we didn't guess it.

Similarly, for E: in BER, we have E at position 2 and it's correct. If there is another E? But we don't know.

Now, back to possibilities. We need letters for positions 4 and 5, excluding A,I,S,Y,L.

Also, from guess 1, R and E were present but not at position 1 and 5 respectively. Since in the secret word, E is at position 2, that satisfies being not at 5 (as per guess 1). And R is at position 3, not 1, so that also satisfies.

Now, what letters can we use? The remaining letters of the alphabet minus excluded ones: A, I, S, Y, L are out. Also, we haven't used: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

But we should choose common English words.

Common ""BER"" words:
- BERET: positions 4=E, 5=T. But wait, E is already in the word? The feedback from guess 1 said E is in the word but not at position 5, which is fine since E is at position 2. However, if we have another E at position 4, that's possible? We don't have any feedback saying that E cannot be at position 4. In fact, guess 1 had E at position 5? But wait, guess 1 was RAISE, which had E at position 5, and it was marked as wrong position (-), meaning E is in the word but not at 5. So having E at position 4 is allowed.

But note: if the word is BERET, then what about letter T? We don't know if T is excluded or not.

Similarly, another word: BERTH: BER + T and H? Positions 4=T, 5=H.

Or BERGS: BER + G and S? But S is excluded, so no.

BERKS: BER + K and S? But S excluded.

BERME: but E at position 4? And M, but E again? Also, we have to see.

List of common ""BER__"" words:

- BERET (E and T)
- BERTH (T and H)
- BERGS (G and S) -> S excluded, invalid
- BERKS (K and S) -> S excluded, invalid
- BERMS (M and S) -> S excluded, invalid
- BEROB (O and B) -> B? But B is already in first position? But duplicate B? We don't know, but B is not excluded? But the word BEROB: positions 4=O, 5=B. Now, B would be at position 5? But we have B at position 1, so a duplicate B? The feedback so far doesn't indicate anything about duplicates.

But let's see: in guess 1, we had R and only one R, but the secret might have duplicates. Similarly for E or B.

However, BEROB is less common, perhaps not the word.

Another word: BERAY? But Y is excluded.

BERKY? But Y excluded.

So likely candidates: BERET, BERTH, BERME? BERME is a word? It means a slope. Also, BERGS is invalid because S is excluded.

What about BERYL? But we already guessed that and it was not correct (only the first three were correct, not the last two).

In our case, the secret word has BER followed by two letters that are not Y and L (and not A,I,S).

Also, from the feedback of guess 1: E was marked with (-) at position 5, meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. In BERET, E is at position 4, which is not 5, so that's fine. Similarly, R is at position 1 in RAISE? But wait, RAISE had R at position 1? And we got R(-), meaning R is present but not at position 1. In the secret word, R is at position 3, so that's fine.

Now, if BERET is the word, then the last two are E and T.

But wait, in BERET, there are two E's: one at position 2 and one at position 4.

Is that possible? The feedback doesn't prevent that.

How about BERTH? That has T and H.

Similarly, there's BERET and BERTH.

We should try to use letters that we haven't tested to get more information? But at this point, with three fixed letters, and only two unknown, we might be able to guess the word.

But we have 6 tries, so we can try one of these.

Consider BERET: if we guess BERET and it turns out to be correct, great. If not, we get feedback on the E and T.

Similarly, if we guess BERTH.

But note that we have not tested T or H yet.

Also, E has been confirmed at position 2, but if there is another E, that's possible.

But in the feedback from guess 1: RAISE had E at position 5 and we got E(-), meaning E is in the word but not at 5. Now, if the word has E at position 4, then E is present elsewhere, so that is consistent.

Another point: in guess 2 (BERYL), we had E at position 2 and we got ✓, so that's fixed. And R at position 3 ✓.

Now, if the word were BERET, then in guess 2 (BERYL), we have:
- B: correct position (1)
- E: correct (2)
- R: correct (3)
- Y: not present, so marked x
- L: not present, so marked x

Which matches the feedback.

Similarly, for BERTH: same, but Y and L not present.

Now, are there other words?
- BERGY? But Y excluded.
- BERKO? Or BERKS? But S excluded.
- BEROB? O and B, but B is at position 5? But B is used at 1, which might be okay? But BEROB is not common.
- BERME? M and E? So BERME: positions 4=M, 5=E? But position 5 is E? Wait, but in guess 1, E was at position 5 and we got E(-), meaning E is not at position 5? If the word was BERME with E at position 5, that would contradict the feedback from guess 1.

Exactly! So from guess 1: E(-) at position 5 means that E is NOT at position 5 in the secret word. Therefore, we cannot have E at position 5 in any word.

Similarly, R cannot be at position 1.

Therefore, BERME cannot be the word because it ends with E at position 5.

Similarly, let's check others:

- BERET: positions are 1:B, 2:E, 3:R, 4:E, 5:T → E at position 2 and 4, T at 5. Position 5 is T, not E, so okay.

- BERTH: positions 1:B, 2:E, 3:R, 4:T, 5:H → position 5 is H, not E, okay.

- What about BERET and BERTH? Are there others?

Another word: BEREK? But K, however, it's not common. Also, position 4=E, 5=K? E at position 4 is fine, and K at 5.

But BERK is a word? Actually, BERET and BERTH are more common.

Now, we also have the letter E appearing again? But that's possible.

But note: in guess 1, we had E at position 5 marked ""-"" meaning present but not at 5. If the word has E only once at position 2, then that ""-"" in guess 1 is accounted for by position 2. If the word has E at position 4 as well, then the E at position 2 accounts for both? No, the presence is noted regardless.

The key is that the feedback for each position is independent.

But we can have duplicate letters? For example, the secret word could have two E's? But we need to see the frequency.

For BERET: if we assume that, then in guess 1 RAISE, the E at 5 was incorrect position because E is at 2 and 4, but the feedback ""-"" means it is in the word but not at that position, which is true because E is not at 5.

Similarly, for BERTH: there is only one E at position 2, so the E in RAISE (position 5) was incorrect position because E is at position 2.

Same for BERET with two E's: position 2 and 4.

Now, another candidate: BERAY? But Y excluded.

BERY? Not 5 letters.

BEROE? O and E? Position 4=O, 5=E→ E at position 5? But E cannot be at position 5? So not possible.

Similarly, must not have E at position 5.

Therefore, valid options: BERET, BERTH, maybe BERKO? but K and O? BERKO: 4=K, 5=O? No E at 5.

But BERKO is a proper name perhaps? Not ideal.

Another one: BERK? Only 4 letters? No.

BERGS: has S, excluded.

So the most common two: BERET and BERTH.

We should choose one and guess to confirm.

But note: we have only two unknowns and many letters untested, so guessing either will give information.

But a key point: in BERET, the fourth letter is E. If we guess BERET, and if it's wrong, we might get feedback on E at position 4.

Similarly for BERTH.

To maximize information, we could choose a different word that introduces new letters? But since we have three fixed and only two spots, and we want to solve quickly, we can try BERET or BERTH.

But which one? Let's think.

We also have the feedback from guess 1: the word contains R and E. In BERET, there are two E's and one R? BERET has E, R? But R is at position 3. In BERTH: one E, one R.

That's fine.

But let's look at the available letters.

We could also consider a word like BERTy? but Y excluded.

Maybe BERMUDA? too long.

Another word: BERY? not five.

Perhaps BERME? but position 5 E? Not allowed.

So let's go with BERET.

But wait, there's another word: BER? No.

BORED? But starts with B O? Not BER.

No, it has to start with BER.

So, I think BERET is a strong candidate.

But let's double-check feedback compatibility.

If the word is BERET:
- Guess 1: RAISE → R is at position 3 in secret? In RAISE, R is at 1? Secret has R at position 3? So R(-): correct, because not position 1? But it is present.
- A(x) correct, not present
- I(x) correct
- S(x) correct
- E in RAISE at position 5? Secret has E at position 2 and 4? So E is present? Thus E(-): because not at position 5? Correct.

Guess 2: BERYL → B(✓), E(✓), R(✓) correct. Y and L not present? BERET has no Y or L? Correct.

So it fits.

Similarly, BERTH:
- Similar for guess 1 and 2.

Guess 2 for BERTH has Y and L absent, fits.

Both seem possible? How to distinguish?

We don't have information about T or H? They haven't been tested.

So we might need to guess one.

Since both are valid, let's choose BERET because it includes another E? But that's arbitrary.

To be safe, we can guess BERET.

If it is correct, we win. If not, the feedback will tell us.

For example, if we guess BERET and the word is BERTH, then:
- First three letters BER✓ (same)
- Fourth letter E: but in secret BERTH, position 4 is T, so E should be marked 'x' if not present? Or if E is present elsewhere? But in BERET, we have two E's? But if secret is BERTH, it has only one E at position 2.

Let's simulate:

Secret: BERTH

Guess: BERET
- Position 1: B = B → ✓
- Position 2: E = E → ✓
- Position 3: R = R → ✓
- Position 4: E vs T → E is not T, and is E present in secret? Secret has only E at position 2? So E at position 4 should be 'x' because it is not in the word at any other position? Wait, no: the secret BERTH contains E only at position 2? So E at position 4 is not in the word? Or?

In the secret word BERTH: the letters are B,E,R,T,H. E is present once.

In guess BERET: 
- Position 1: B = B → ✓
- Position 2: E = E → ✓
- Position 3: R = R → ✓
- Position 4: E → does this match T? No. Also, is E in the secret word elsewhere? Secret has E only at position 2? Which is already matched? So for position 4, E is not present because the secret E is already accounted for? Or is it?

In Wordle, each letter in the guess is matched to the secret. For duplicate letters, it can be tricky.

Standard rules: if a letter appears multiple times in the guess, each instance is evaluated separately.

For secret BERTH (one E), and guess BERET:
- Position 1: B ✓
- Position 2: E ✓
- Position 3: R ✓
- Position 4: E: this E is not in the secret? Because the secret has only one E at position 2. So since position 2 E was already matched, position 4 E should be marked 'x' as not present.
- Position 5: T: in secret BERTH, T is at position 4? So position 5: T vs H? T vs H: T not equal, and T is in the secret at position 4? So it is present but in wrong position? Therefore, T should be '-'.

But the secret word has T at position 4? And the guess has T at position 5? So T is in the word but at position 4, not 5, so '-' for position 5.

Similarly, E at position 4: since the secret has no E at position 4, and the secret has only one E which is at position 2 (already matched), so E at position 4 should be 'x'.

Therefore the feedback for BERET with secret BERTH would be: B(✓) E(✓) R(✓) E(x) T(-)

But we are guessing BERET, and we don't know the secret.

Alternatively, if the secret was BERET and we guess BERET, it will be all ✓.

To get maximum information, we could guess a word that distinguishes the possibilities.

For example, if we guess a word like BERTH, then:
- If secret is BERTH, all letters correct.
- If secret is BERET, then similarly, we'd have feedback with T not matching? Guess BERTH vs secret BERET:
  Position 1:B ✓,2:E ✓,3:R ✓,4:T vs E? T not E, and T not present in secret BERET? In BERET, the letters are B,E,R,E,T? So T is present at position 5? So:
  - Position 4: T vs E? Mismatch? And T is present in secret? At position 5? So T should be marked '-' because it's in the word but not at position 4?
  - Position 5: H vs T? H not in secret, and secret has T at position 5? So T should be matched? Wait, confusing.

Guess: B E R T H vs Secret: B E R E T?
Secret: B E R E T

Guess: B E R T H
Position 1: B ✓ (matches)
Position 2: E ✓ (matches)
Position 3: R ✓ (matches)
Position 4: T vs E? Mismatch? Is E in secret? There is E at position 4? So T not E? Also, T is present in secret? At position 5? So T in guess position 4 should be marked '-' because T is in secret (at position 5) but not at position 4.
Position 5: H vs T? H not present in secret? Secret has T at position 5? So H should be 'x'? Also, since T at position 5 is already matched by the secret T, but the guess H is nothing.

This is messy.

To avoid complication, since BER__ we have, we can guess BERET.

But there might be another candidate? Is there BER? Only BER something.

Another candidate: BEROW? Not common.

Perhaps we are missing one: BERET and BERTH are the main two.

So I'll go with BERET.

So my next guess is BERET.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: Feedback R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)  
  **Meaning**:  
  - R is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - A, I, S are not in the word.  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2 (BERYL)**: Feedback B(✓), E(✓), R(✓), Y(x), L(x)  
  **Meaning**:  
  - B is correct and in position 1.  
  - E is correct and in position 2.  
  - R is correct and in position 3.  
  - Y and L are not in the word.  

### Deductions:
1. The word starts with ""BER"" (positions 1-3 confirmed).  
2. Positions 4 and 5 are unknown.  
3. **Present letters**: B, E, R.  
4. **Excluded letters**: A, I, S, Y, L (based on feedback).  
5. **Possible letters**: Common remaining letters like T, H, M, N, O, C, D, F, G, K, P, U.  
6. **Constraints**:  
   - E cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 1 feedback).  
   - R cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1 feedback)—already satisfied.  

### Evaluating Possibilities:
- Words starting with ""BER"" and excluding A, I, S, Y, L:  
  - **BERET**: Ends with E and T.  
    - Position 4: E—this would be a second E. Position 5: T. Consistent with E not at position 5.  
    - Not excluded by feedback.  
  - **BERTH**: Ends with T and H.  
    - Position 4: T. Position 5: H.  
    - Also consistent with constraints.  
- Both are common English words fitting the pattern.  
- Other options like BERGS or BERKS are invalid due to excluded S.  

### Optimal Next Guess:
- **BERET** is a strong candidate as it tests for a possible duplicate E (position 4) and introduces T—a new untested letter.  
- If correct, solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on position 4 (E) and 5 (T) will provide valuable information to distinguish **BERTH** or other candidates.",Guess 3: BERET -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) E(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
