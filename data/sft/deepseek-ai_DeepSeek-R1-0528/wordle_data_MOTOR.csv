We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the word
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is at position 2)
 A(x) -> A is not in the word
 N(x) -> N is not in the word
 E(x) -> E is not in the word

 So we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position.
 - The word does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters and contains R, we can try to think of words that have R, but not at position 2, and without C,A,N,E.

 We must avoid using C, A, N, E in our next guess.

 We also note that in ""crane"", the R was at position 2. Since it's marked as '-', meaning it's in the word but not at that position, then R must appear in a different position (either 1, 3, 4, or 5).

 However, the feedback does not tell us how many times R appears. It could be once or multiple times? But typically in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, the feedback is tricky. But here we don't have that information.

 Since we have no information about duplicates, we assume the simplest until proven otherwise.

 We need to choose a word that:
 - Does not contain C, A, N, E.
 - Contains R, but R should not be at position 2 (if it were at position 2, it would have been marked as correct, but it's not). So R must be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Also, we want to cover new common letters. Common vowels: we have used A and E, but they are ruled out. Remaining vowels: O, I, U, sometimes Y (but we don't know if Y is used). Also common consonants: S, T, L, B, etc.

 Let me think of words that contain R and use common letters we haven't tried.

 We have ruled out: C, A, N, E.

 We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should aim for words that have vowels (like O or I) and common consonants.

 Example: ""SPORT"" -> but R is at position 3? In ""SPORT"": S P O R T. R is at position 4? Actually, 4th letter.

 Another: ""ROUND"" -> but R is at position 1? However, we have R at position 1? But we know R is not at position 2 from previous, but position 1 is possible.

 However, note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked present but wrong position. That means R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, it might be correct if that's where it belongs.

 Let's think: we don't know the position of R, so we can try to put it in a new position.

 Also, we need to cover more letters.

 I think a good choice might be ""SPIRE"", but E is ruled out.

 ""SPIRE"" has E, which is ruled out. So avoid E.

 Another word: ""ROOMY"" - but R at position 1, O at 2 and 3, Y at 5? But we don't know about duplicates? Avoiding duplicates might be better for now.

 Alternatively, ""RISKY"" - but R at position 1.

 Since R must be in the word, and we haven't tried many letters, let's try a word with R at position 1 and then new letters.

 How about ""ROBOT""? But R is at 1. But we haven't tested B and T? But O is a vowel we haven't tried.

 But note: we have to avoid A, E, C, N.

 ""ROBOT"": R O B O T -> O repeated? Duplicates might complicate.

 How about ""ROAST"" - but A is ruled out? So we cannot use A.

 We need a word without A and without C, N, E.

 Let me consider: ""GROUP"" - G R O U P -> R at position 2? But we must avoid R at position 2 because in the previous guess R at position 2 was marked as wrong position? Actually, we are allowed to use R in any position but we know the secret word has R and position 2 is not correct. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would be again marked '-' if the secret word doesn't have R at position 2? Actually, if the secret word has R only once and not at 2, then using R at position 2 again would still be marked as '-'. But if the secret word has two R's, it might be different? We don't want to complicate.

 To maximize information, we should put R in a position we haven't tried. We tried position 2 already. So let's avoid position 2 and try R at a new position, say 1 or 3 or 4 or 5.

 How about a word with R at position 4? Like ""ABOUT"" - but A and O? A is ruled out! So no.

 How about ""LURKS""? However, we haven't tried L,U,K,S.

 But the word must be 5 letters without A, C, E, N.

 ""LURKS"" is a word: L U R K S -> R at position 3? Actually, positions: L(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), S(5).

 That could work? But we haven't tested the vowel U.

 Or ""WORDS"": W O R D S -> R at position 3? O is a vowel we need? But what are the vowels? O and sometimes W and Y.

 Alternatively, let's try a more balanced word: let's use a word with R at position 1 and then test new common letters.

 Example: ""ROILS"": R O I L S -> but R at 1, O at 2? We haven't tried O and I. Also L and S.

 But note: we have R at position 1. We know from the first feedback that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if the secret word has R at position 1, then in this guess we might get ✓ for R.

 Alternatively, if R is at position 3,4, or 5, then putting R at position 1 would still be marked as '-' (if not position 1) and we learn that position 1 is not R.

 Another word: ""TRIPS"" - T R I P S -> but R at position 2? We want to avoid the position we already tried? This would put R at position 2 again, which we know is not correct? Actually, we cannot avoid completely? But in the previous feedback, R was in the word but not at 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would only be correct if there is another R? But maybe the word has two R's? We don't know.

 To avoid confusion, it might be better not to reuse R in position 2? Or it doesn't matter? Actually, we can use it to test for multiple R's? But that might be overcomplicate for the second guess.

 Since we have limited chances, we should avoid using R in the same position we already know is wrong? Actually, we already know position 2 is wrong for R, so in the next guess, if we put R in position 2 and get '-', then we learn nothing new? Because in the secret word R is not at position 2, so if we put R at 2, regardless of how many R's, if there is only one R and it's not at 2, then it would be '-'. If there are two R's and one of them is at 2? But the secret word has R but not at position 2? Then what? Actually, the feedback would still mark it as '-' if there is an R elsewhere but not at 2? Or if the secret word has two R's, then if we put R in position 2, but the secret word has an R at position 2? But we know it doesn't because the first feedback said R was present but not at position 2. Therefore, position 2 cannot be R? So we don't expect R at position 2 to ever be ✓.

 Therefore, to save a position, we should not put R at position 2 again? Or we can? But we would get the same '-' and waste a position? So we should try to put R in a position we haven't tried? That is, position 1,3,4, or5.

 Moreover, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 With that, let's choose a word that:
 - Places R at position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5.
 - Contains common letters we haven't tried (like O, I, S, T, L, etc.)

 How about ""PARTY""? But A and Y? A is ruled out? So no.

 ""FIRST"": F I R S T -> R at position 3? That's good. And we test F, I, S, T? But I is a vowel. And S, T are common.

 However, we haven't tried I and F? F is actually less common? Maybe we can avoid F? How about ""SHIRT"" - S H I R T -> R at position 4? H and I? Or ""STORM"" - S T O R M -> R at position 4? And we get O as a vowel? Also R is at position 4? Then we learn about R at position 4 and position 2? Also, we avoid A, C, E, N.

 Another word: ""SPORT"" - S P O R T -> R at position 4? So we test S, P, O, R, T? Without duplicates? That seems good.

 But note we already know R is in the word? So putting R again is okay? We are confirming its position? We want to see if R is at position 4? If it is, we get ✓ at position 4? Or if it's at 1 or 3? Then we might get '-' at position 4? And then we have more information.

 So I think ""SPORT"" is a good candidate? But SPORT: S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

 Also, it does not contain any of the discarded letters (C,A,N,E).

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that puts R at position 1? To see if that's the spot? Like ""ROBOT""? But it has O repeated? Or ""ROOMY""? Better avoid duplicates? Then ""ROBIN""? But N is ruled out? So no.

 Or ""RUSTS""? But duplicate S and U? And T? 

 Let's check ""SPORT"": it has the advantage of testing P as well? But P is common? Or not? But S, T, O are very common? So I think it's a solid choice.

 But wait, what if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we wouldn't learn from ""SPORT""? Actually, if R is at position 1, then in ""SPORT"", R wouldn't be in position 1? We are putting R at 4? Then it would be marked as '-'? But then we know R is not at 4? And we still have R at other positions to try? So we can then try position 1 next time? That's acceptable.

 Similarly, if R is at position 4, then we get ✓ on R? That's good? So either way we learn.

 So I will go with ""SPORT"".

 Let me confirm: 
 SPORT: letters S, P, O, R, T? All new? Yes, except R.

 And no duplicates.

 And it's a valid English word.

 So guess: SPORT

<guess>sport</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where:
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked ""x"")
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"")

I deduced that:
1. The secret word contains the letter R, but not at position 2.
2. Letters C, A, N, and E are eliminated, so the next guess must avoid these.
3. To maximize information, I prioritized:
   - Testing R in new positions (1, 3, 4, or 5) since position 2 is already known to be incorrect.
   - Introducing new common vowels and consonants not yet tested (e.g., O, I, S, T).
   - Avoiding duplicates to simplify feedback.

I considered words like ""FIRST"" (R at position 3), ""SHIRT"" (R at position 4), and ""SPORT"" (R at position 4). Choosing ""SPORT"" as the next guess because:
- It places R at position 4 (an untested position).
- It introduces new common consonants (S, P, T) and a new vowel (O).
- It avoids the eliminated letters (C, A, N, E) and duplicates.

If R is at position 4 in the secret word, this will confirm its correct position. Otherwise, feedback on R (e.g., ""-"" or ""x"") will further narrow its location. Other positions (S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5) will test four new letters.

<guess>sport</guess>",sport,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":

- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked ""x"")
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"")

I deduced that:
1. The secret word contains the letter R, but not at position 2.
2. Letters C, A, N, and E are eliminated, so the next guess must avoid these.
3. To maximize information, I prioritized:
   - Testing R in new positions (1, 3, 4, or 5) since position 2 is already known to be incorrect.
   - Introducing new common vowels and consonants not yet tested (e.g., O, I, S, T).
   - Avoiding duplicates to simplify feedback.

I considered words like ""FIRST"" (R at position 3), ""SHIRT"" (R at position 4), and ""SPORT"" (R at position 4). Choosing ""SPORT"" as the next guess because:
- It places R at position 4 (an untested position).
- It introduces new common consonants (S, P, T) and a new vowel (O).
- It avoids the eliminated letters (C, A, N, E) and duplicates.

If R is at position 4 in the secret word, this will confirm its correct position. Otherwise, feedback on R (e.g., ""-"" or ""x"") will further narrow its location. Other positions (S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5) will test four new letters.",Guess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,MOTOR,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the word
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is at position 2)
 A(x) -> A is not in the word
 N(x) -> N is not in the word
 E(x) -> E is not in the word

 So we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position.
 - The word does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters and contains R, we can try to think of words that have R, but not at position 2, and without C,A,N,E.

 We must avoid using C, A, N, E in our next guess.

 We also note that in ""crane"", the R was at position 2. Since it's marked as '-', meaning it's in the word but not at that position, then R must appear in a different position (either 1, 3, 4, or 5).

 However, the feedback does not tell us how many times R appears. It could be once or multiple times? But typically in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, the feedback is tricky. But here we don't have that information.

 Since we have no information about duplicates, we assume the simplest until proven otherwise.

 We need to choose a word that:
 - Does not contain C, A, N, E.
 - Contains R, but R should not be at position 2 (if it were at position 2, it would have been marked as correct, but it's not). So R must be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Also, we want to cover new common letters. Common vowels: we have used A and E, but they are ruled out. Remaining vowels: O, I, U, sometimes Y (but we don't know if Y is used). Also common consonants: S, T, L, B, etc.

 Let me think of words that contain R and use common letters we haven't tried.

 We have ruled out: C, A, N, E.

 We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should aim for words that have vowels (like O or I) and common consonants.

 Example: ""SPORT"" -> but R is at position 3? In ""SPORT"": S P O R T. R is at position 4? Actually, 4th letter.

 Another: ""ROUND"" -> but R is at position 1? However, we have R at position 1? But we know R is not at position 2 from previous, but position 1 is possible.

 However, note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked present but wrong position. That means R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, it might be correct if that's where it belongs.

 Let's think: we don't know the position of R, so we can try to put it in a new position.

 Also, we need to cover more letters.

 I think a good choice might be ""SPIRE"", but E is ruled out.

 ""SPIRE"" has E, which is ruled out. So avoid E.

 Another word: ""ROOMY"" - but R at position 1, O at 2 and 3, Y at 5? But we don't know about duplicates? Avoiding duplicates might be better for now.

 Alternatively, ""RISKY"" - but R at position 1.

 Since R must be in the word, and we haven't tried many letters, let's try a word with R at position 1 and then new letters.

 How about ""ROBOT""? But R is at 1. But we haven't tested B and T? But O is a vowel we haven't tried.

 But note: we have to avoid A, E, C, N.

 ""ROBOT"": R O B O T -> O repeated? Duplicates might complicate.

 How about ""ROAST"" - but A is ruled out? So we cannot use A.

 We need a word without A and without C, N, E.

 Let me consider: ""GROUP"" - G R O U P -> R at position 2? But we must avoid R at position 2 because in the previous guess R at position 2 was marked as wrong position? Actually, we are allowed to use R in any position but we know the secret word has R and position 2 is not correct. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would be again marked '-' if the secret word doesn't have R at position 2? Actually, if the secret word has R only once and not at 2, then using R at position 2 again would still be marked as '-'. But if the secret word has two R's, it might be different? We don't want to complicate.

 To maximize information, we should put R in a position we haven't tried. We tried position 2 already. So let's avoid position 2 and try R at a new position, say 1 or 3 or 4 or 5.

 How about a word with R at position 4? Like ""ABOUT"" - but A and O? A is ruled out! So no.

 How about ""LURKS""? However, we haven't tried L,U,K,S.

 But the word must be 5 letters without A, C, E, N.

 ""LURKS"" is a word: L U R K S -> R at position 3? Actually, positions: L(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), S(5).

 That could work? But we haven't tested the vowel U.

 Or ""WORDS"": W O R D S -> R at position 3? O is a vowel we need? But what are the vowels? O and sometimes W and Y.

 Alternatively, let's try a more balanced word: let's use a word with R at position 1 and then test new common letters.

 Example: ""ROILS"": R O I L S -> but R at 1, O at 2? We haven't tried O and I. Also L and S.

 But note: we have R at position 1. We know from the first feedback that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if the secret word has R at position 1, then in this guess we might get ✓ for R.

 Alternatively, if R is at position 3,4, or 5, then putting R at position 1 would still be marked as '-' (if not position 1) and we learn that position 1 is not R.

 Another word: ""TRIPS"" - T R I P S -> but R at position 2? We want to avoid the position we already tried? This would put R at position 2 again, which we know is not correct? Actually, we cannot avoid completely? But in the previous feedback, R was in the word but not at 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would only be correct if there is another R? But maybe the word has two R's? We don't know.

 To avoid confusion, it might be better not to reuse R in position 2? Or it doesn't matter? Actually, we can use it to test for multiple R's? But that might be overcomplicate for the second guess.

 Since we have limited chances, we should avoid using R in the same position we already know is wrong? Actually, we already know position 2 is wrong for R, so in the next guess, if we put R in position 2 and get '-', then we learn nothing new? Because in the secret word R is not at position 2, so if we put R at 2, regardless of how many R's, if there is only one R and it's not at 2, then it would be '-'. If there are two R's and one of them is at 2? But the secret word has R but not at position 2? Then what? Actually, the feedback would still mark it as '-' if there is an R elsewhere but not at 2? Or if the secret word has two R's, then if we put R in position 2, but the secret word has an R at position 2? But we know it doesn't because the first feedback said R was present but not at position 2. Therefore, position 2 cannot be R? So we don't expect R at position 2 to ever be ✓.

 Therefore, to save a position, we should not put R at position 2 again? Or we can? But we would get the same '-' and waste a position? So we should try to put R in a position we haven't tried? That is, position 1,3,4, or5.

 Moreover, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 With that, let's choose a word that:
 - Places R at position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5.
 - Contains common letters we haven't tried (like O, I, S, T, L, etc.)

 How about ""PARTY""? But A and Y? A is ruled out? So no.

 ""FIRST"": F I R S T -> R at position 3? That's good. And we test F, I, S, T? But I is a vowel. And S, T are common.

 However, we haven't tried I and F? F is actually less common? Maybe we can avoid F? How about ""SHIRT"" - S H I R T -> R at position 4? H and I? Or ""STORM"" - S T O R M -> R at position 4? And we get O as a vowel? Also R is at position 4? Then we learn about R at position 4 and position 2? Also, we avoid A, C, E, N.

 Another word: ""SPORT"" - S P O R T -> R at position 4? So we test S, P, O, R, T? Without duplicates? That seems good.

 But note we already know R is in the word? So putting R again is okay? We are confirming its position? We want to see if R is at position 4? If it is, we get ✓ at position 4? Or if it's at 1 or 3? Then we might get '-' at position 4? And then we have more information.

 So I think ""SPORT"" is a good candidate? But SPORT: S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

 Also, it does not contain any of the discarded letters (C,A,N,E).

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that puts R at position 1? To see if that's the spot? Like ""ROBOT""? But it has O repeated? Or ""ROOMY""? Better avoid duplicates? Then ""ROBIN""? But N is ruled out? So no.

 Or ""RUSTS""? But duplicate S and U? And T? 

 Let's check ""SPORT"": it has the advantage of testing P as well? But P is common? Or not? But S, T, O are very common? So I think it's a solid choice.

 But wait, what if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we wouldn't learn from ""SPORT""? Actually, if R is at position 1, then in ""SPORT"", R wouldn't be in position 1? We are putting R at 4? Then it would be marked as '-'? But then we know R is not at 4? And we still have R at other positions to try? So we can then try position 1 next time? That's acceptable.

 Similarly, if R is at position 4, then we get ✓ on R? That's good? So either way we learn.

 So I will go with ""SPORT"".

 Let me confirm: 
 SPORT: letters S, P, O, R, T? All new? Yes, except R.

 And no duplicates.

 And it's a valid English word.

 So guess: SPORT

We are given feedback for the second guess ""sport"":
 S(x) -> S is not in the word
 P(x) -> P is not in the word
 O(-) -> O is in the word but not in the third position
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not in the fourth position
 T(-) -> T is in the word but not in the fifth position

 From the first guess, we already knew:
   R is in the word but not at position 2.

 Now we know:
   O is in the word, but not at position 3.
   R is in the word, but not at position 4 (and we already knew not at 2).
   T is in the word, but not at position 5.
   S and P are not in the word.

 Also, from the first guess, we know that C, A, N, E are not in the word.

 So, eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, S, P.

 We have confirmed letters: R, O, T.

 We know the word contains R, O, T, and two more letters.

 The positions we know are wrong for:
   R: position 2 and 4
   O: position 3
   T: position 5

 We have to consider the possible positions for R, O, T.

 Since the word is 5 letters, and we have three confirmed letters, we need to find two more.

 We also know that the secret word does not have: C, A, N, E, S, P.

 We have not yet tried many letters. Let's list the available common consonants and vowels.

 Vowels left: I, U (and sometimes Y, but we'll consider it a consonant or vowel as needed)
 Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to form a word that has R, O, T and two other letters from the available set.

 Also, we must place R, O, T in positions that are not forbidden for them.

 For R: cannot be at 2 or 4 -> possible positions: 1, 3, 5.
 For O: cannot be at 3 -> possible positions: 1, 2, 4, 5.
 For T: cannot be at 5 -> possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.

 Now, we need to think of words that have R, O, T and two other letters, avoiding the eliminated ones.

 Let's try to think of common words.

 Example: ""VOTER"" -> but E is eliminated? E is out, so no.
 ""MOTOR"" -> has O repeated? and R at the end? But we have T? No, ""MOTOR"" doesn't have T? Actually, M O T O R? That's 5 letters: M, O, T, O, R -> but O repeated? And T at position 3? But we have two O's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the word ""MOTOR"" is valid? However, we have to consider that the feedback might not indicate duplicate letters clearly? But in standard Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky? We should avoid duplicates for now? But if the secret word has duplicates, we have to account for that? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far? So we can try without duplicates first.

 Another word: ""FORTY"" -> F O R T Y -> letters: F, O, R, T, Y? This has no duplicates? And F and Y are new? Also, O at position 2, R at 3, T at 4? But we have to check the forbidden positions.

 For O: position 2 is allowed? Yes, because we only know it's not at 3.
 For R: position 3 is allowed? We know R cannot be at 2 or 4? Position 3 is not forbidden? So yes.
 For T: position 4 is allowed? We know T cannot be at 5? Position 4 is allowed.

 So ""FORTY"" seems possible? But we don't know if F and Y are in the word? We are going to test them.

 But note: we are making a guess to get more information? We know R, O, T are in the word? So we can try to place them in positions that are possible? And test two new letters? F and Y.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word might have one of these letters? We don't know? So we can try.

 Another possibility: ""DOGMA"" -> but A is eliminated? No.

 ""BROTH"" -> B R O T H? This has R at position 2? But wait, we know R cannot be at position 2? Because in the first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position? So R cannot be at position 2? Therefore, ""BROTH"" would have R at position 2? That is forbidden? So we cannot use R at position 2? So ""BROTH"" is invalid? Because we know R is not at 2? So we must avoid putting R at 2? Similarly, we must avoid O at 3 and T at 5? But in ""BROTH"", O is at 3? And we know O cannot be at 3? So that's also forbidden? So ""BROTH"" is not a good choice.

 How about ""THROW""? T H R O W? 
 Positions: T at 1, H at 2, R at 3, O at 4, W at 5.
 Check:
   R at 3: allowed? Yes, because R cannot be at 2 or 4? 3 is okay.
   O at 4: allowed? We know O cannot be at 3? 4 is okay? Yes.
   T at 1: allowed? We know T cannot be at 5? 1 is okay? Yes.

 So ""THROW"" uses T, H, R, O, W? And H and W are new? Also, no duplicates? And we avoid eliminated letters? Yes, because C,A,N,E,S,P are out? H and W are not eliminated? So we can test H and W.

 But note: we have T at position 1? We don't know if T is at 1? It might be? And we are testing R at 3 and O at 4? Also, we get to test H and W.

 Alternatively, ""GROWL"" -> G R O W L? But R at position 2? We know R cannot be at 2? So no.

 ""TROOP"" -> T R O O P? But P is eliminated? And O repeated? So no.

 ""FORTY"" as I thought earlier: F at 1, O at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? 
   O at 2: allowed? Yes? 
   R at 3: allowed? Yes? 
   T at 4: allowed? Yes? 
   But we have T at 4? We know T cannot be at 5? But 4 is allowed? And we are testing F and Y.

 But note: in ""FORTY"", we are putting T at position 4? But we also have to consider that T might be at 4? But we don't know? We are testing it? If T is at 4, then we get a ✓? Otherwise, we get a '-'? And we learn.

 Similarly, for ""THROW"": T at 1, H at 2, R at 3, O at 4, W at 5? 
   We are testing T at 1? If T is at 1, we get ✓? Otherwise, we get feedback? Similarly for others.

 Which one to choose? Both are valid? We need to choose one that covers more common letters? Or that might be the word? 

 But note: we have two letters to find? Actually, we know the word has R, O, T and two others? So we are trying to guess the two others and the positions.

 Another word: ""ROWTH""? Is that a word? Not common? ""GROWL"" is a word but R at 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""MORTY""? M O R T Y? 
   O at 1? Then R at 3? T at 4? 
   Positions: M(1)? O at 2? Actually, M O R T Y: M at 1, O at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? 
   Then O at 2: allowed? Yes? 
   R at 3: allowed? Yes? 
   T at 4: allowed? Yes? 
   So same as ""FORTY"" but with M instead of F? 

 We can choose between F, M, H, W, etc? 

 But we want to test letters that are more common? 

 Common consonants: H, D, L, M, W, etc? F and Y are less common? 

 So ""THROW"" might be better? Because H and W are common? 

 Also, ""THROW"" tests T at position 1? Which we haven't tested before? And we know T is in the word? So if T is at 1, we get a ✓? Otherwise, we get a '-'? 

 Similarly, in ""FORTY"", we test T at 4? 

 But we don't know which position T is in? So both are valid? 

 However, we have to consider that in the first guess, we had no correct positions? And in the second guess, we had no correct positions? So it's likely that the positions we are trying for R, O, T are not correct? But we don't know? 

 I think ""THROW"" is a good candidate? 

 But let's check the feedback we have: 
   In the first guess, R was at position 2 and was present? So R is not at 2? 
   In the second guess, O was at 3 and was present? So O is not at 3? 
   R was at 4 and was present? So R is not at 4? 
   T was at 5 and was present? So T is not at 5? 

 So for R, the only positions left are 1, 3, 5? 
   In ""THROW"", we put R at 3? 
   If R is at 3, then we get a ✓? 
   If not, then we get a '-'? 

 Similarly, for O, we put at 4? 
   If O is at 4, then ✓? 
   If not, then '-'? 

 And for T, we put at 1? 
   If T is at 1, then ✓? 
   If not, then '-'? 

 So we are testing three positions? That might be efficient? 

 Alternatively, in ""FORTY"", we put O at 2, R at 3, T at 4? 
   We are testing O at 2, R at 3, T at 4? 

 But we don't test T at 1? 

 Since we have more positions to test for T? We know T is not at 5? So it could be at 1,2,3,4? 

 But in ""THROW"", we test T at 1? 

 I think ""THROW"" is a better choice because it tests T at a new position (1) that we haven't tested? 

 Also, we test H and W? 

 So I'll go with ""THROW"". 

 But note: we must avoid the eliminated letters? H and W are not eliminated? 

 So guess: THROW

 However, let me double-check: 
   First guess: crane -> eliminated C, A, N, E? 
   Second guess: sport -> eliminated S, P? 
   So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 
   And we know R, O, T are in the word? 

 So ""THROW"" uses T, H, R, O, W? All are available? 

 Yes.

After analyzing the feedback from the second guess ""sport"":
- **S(x)** and **P(x)**: S and P are not in the secret word.
- **O(-)**: O is in the word but not at position 3.
- **R(-)**: R is in the word but not at position 4 (and we already knew it's not at position 2 from the first guess).
- **T(-)**: T is in the word but not at position 5.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters**: R, O, T are in the secret word.
2. **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E (from first guess) + S, P (from second guess). Total eliminated: C, A, N, E, S, P.
3. **Position constraints**:
   - R cannot be at positions 2 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 3, or 5.
   - O cannot be at position 3 → possible positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5.
   - T cannot be at position 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 4.
4. **Goal for the next guess**: 
   - Test R, O, T in new positions to narrow down their locations.
   - Introduce new common letters (avoiding eliminated ones) to identify the remaining 2 letters.

### Why ""THROW""?
- **Position testing**:
  - T at position 1 (tests if T is at the start, which is a new position).
  - R at position 3 (tests a new position for R, avoiding 2 and 4).
  - O at position 4 (tests a new position for O, avoiding 3).
- **New letters tested**: H (common consonant) and W (common consonant), both not yet tried.
- **Avoids duplicates and eliminated letters**: Uses distinct letters (T, H, R, O, W) and skips C, A, N, E, S, P.
- **Efficiency**: Tests 3 confirmed letters in untested positions while probing 2 new letters. This maximizes information gain regardless of whether the positions are correct.

If ""THROW"" is correct, we solve the puzzle. If not, feedback on T (position 1), H (position 2), R (position 3), O (position 4), and W (position 5) will significantly narrow possibilities for the next guess.

 P(x) -> P is not in the word
 O(-) -> O is in the word but not in the third position

 T(-) -> T is in the word but not in the fifth position

 From the first guess, we already knew:
   R is in the word but not at position 2.

 Now we know:
   O is in the word, but not at position 3.
   R is in the word, but not at position 4 (and we already knew not at 2).
   T is in the word, but not at position 5.
   S and P are not in the word.

 Also, from the first guess, we know that C, A, N, E are not in the word.

 So, eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, S, P.

 We have confirmed letters: R, O, T.

 We know the word contains R, O, T, and two more letters.

 The positions we know are wrong for:
   R: position 2 and 4
   O: position 3
   T: position 5

 We have to consider the possible positions for R, O, T.

 Since the word is 5 letters, and we have three confirmed letters, we need to find two more.

 We also know that the secret word does not have: C, A, N, E, S, P.

 Also, we must place R, O, T in positions that are not forbidden for them.

 For R: cannot be at 2 or 4 -> possible positions: 1, 3, 5.
 For O: cannot be at 3 -> possible positions: 1, 2, 4, 5.
 For T: cannot be at 5 -> possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.

 Now, we need to think of words that have R, O, T and two other letters, avoiding the eliminated ones.

 Let's try to think of common words.

 Example: ""VOTER"" -> but E is eliminated? E is out, so no.
 ""MOTOR"" -> has O repeated? and R at the end? But we have T? No, ""MOTOR"" doesn't have T? Actually, M O T O R? That's 5 letters: M, O, T, O, R -> but O repeated? And T at position 3?

But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far? So we can try without duplicates first.

 Another word: ""FORTY"" -> F O R T Y -> letters: F, O, R, T, Y? This has no duplicates? And F and Y are new? Also, O at position 2, R at 3, T at 4? But we have to check the forbidden positions.

 For O: position 2 is allowed? Yes, because we only know it's not at 3.
 For R: position 3 is allowed? We know R cannot be at 2 or 4? Position 3 is not forbidden? So yes.
 For T: position 4 is allowed? We know T cannot be at 5? Position 4 is allowed.

 So ""FORTY"" seems possible? But we don't know if F and Y are in the word? We are going to test them.

 But note: we are making a guess to get more information? We know R, O, T are in the word? So we can try to place them in positions that are possible? And test two new letters? F and Y.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word might have one of these letters? We don't know? So we can try.

 Another possibility: ""DOGMA"" -> but A is eliminated? No.

 ""BROTH"" -> B R O T H? This has R at position 2? But wait, we know R cannot be at position 2? Because in the first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position? So R cannot be at position 2? Therefore, ""BROTH"" would have R at position 2? That is forbidden? So we cannot use R at position 2? So ""BROTH"" is invalid? Because we know R is not at 2? So we must avoid putting R at 2? Similarly, we must avoid O at 3 and T at 5? But in ""BROTH"", O is at 3? And we know O cannot be at 3? So that's also forbidden? So ""BROTH"" is not a good choice.

 How about ""THROW""? T H R O W? 
 Positions: T at 1, H at 2, R at 3, O at 4, W at 5.
 Check:
   R at 3: allowed? Yes, because R cannot be at 2 or 4? 3 is okay.
   O at 4: allowed? We know O cannot be at 3? 4 is okay? Yes.
   T at 1: allowed? We know T cannot be at 5? 1 is okay? Yes.

 So ""THROW"" uses T, H, R, O, W? And H and W are new? Also, no duplicates? And we avoid eliminated letters? Yes, because C,A,N,E,S,P are out? H and W are not eliminated? So we can test H and W.

 But note: we have T at position 1? We don't know if T is at 1? It might be? And we are testing R at 3 and O at 4? Also, we get to test H and W.

 Alternatively, ""GROWL"" -> G R O W L? But R at position 2? We know R cannot be at 2? So no.

 ""TROOP"" -> T R O O P? But P is eliminated? And O repeated? So no.

 ""FORTY"" as I thought earlier: F at 1, O at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? 
   O at 2: allowed? Yes? 
   R at 3: allowed? Yes? 
   T at 4: allowed? Yes? 
   But we have T at 4? We know T cannot be at 5? But 4 is allowed? And we are testing F and Y.

 But note: in ""FORTY"", we are putting T at position 4? But we also have to consider that T might be at 4? But we don't know? We are testing it? If T is at 4, then we get a ✓? Otherwise, we get a '-'? And we learn.

 Similarly, for ""THROW"": T at 1, H at 2, R at 3, O at 4, W at 5? 
   We are testing T at 1? If T is at 1, we get ✓? Otherwise, we get feedback? Similarly for others.

 But note: we have two letters to find? Actually, we know the word has R, O, T and two others? So we are trying to guess the two others and the positions.

 Another word: ""ROWTH""? Is that a word? Not common? ""GROWL"" is a word but R at 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""MORTY""? M O R T Y? 
   O at 1? Then R at 3? T at 4? 
   Positions: M(1)? O at 2? Actually, M O R T Y: M at 1, O at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? 
   Then O at 2: allowed? Yes? 
   R at 3: allowed? Yes? 
   T at 4: allowed? Yes? 
   So same as ""FORTY"" but with M instead of F? 

 We can choose between F, M, H, W, etc? 

 But we want to test letters that are more common? 

 Common consonants: H, D, L, M, W, etc? F and Y are less common? 

 So ""THROW"" might be better? Because H and W are common? 

 Also, ""THROW"" tests T at position 1? Which we haven't tested before? And we know T is in the word? So if T is at 1, we get a ✓? Otherwise, we get a '-'? 

 Similarly, in ""FORTY"", we test T at 4? 

 But we don't know which position T is in? So both are valid? 

 However, we have to consider that in the first guess, we had no correct positions? And in the second guess, we had no correct positions? So it's likely that the positions we are trying for R, O, T are not correct? But we don't know?

   In the second guess, O was at 3 and was present? So O is not at 3? 
   R was at 4 and was present? So R is not at 4? 
   T was at 5 and was present? So T is not at 5? 

 So for R, the only positions left are 1, 3, 5? 
   In ""THROW"", we put R at 3? 
   If R is at 3, then we get a ✓? 
   If not, then we get a '-'? 

 Similarly, for O, we put at 4? 
   If O is at 4, then ✓? 
   If not, then '-'? 

 And for T, we put at 1? 
   If T is at 1, then ✓? 
   If not, then '-'? 

 So we are testing three positions? That might be efficient? 

 Alternatively, in ""FORTY"", we put O at 2, R at 3, T at 4? 
   We are testing O at 2, R at 3, T at 4? 

 But we don't test T at 1? 

 Since we have more positions to test for T? We know T is not at 5? So it could be at 1,2,3,4? 

 But in ""THROW"", we test T at 1? 

 I think ""THROW"" is a better choice because it tests T at a new position (1) that we haven't tested? 

 Also, we test H and W? 

 So I'll go with ""THROW"". 

 But note: we must avoid the eliminated letters? H and W are not eliminated? 

 So guess: THROW

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,MOTOR,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the word
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is at position 2)
 A(x) -> A is not in the word
 N(x) -> N is not in the word
 E(x) -> E is not in the word

 So we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position.
 - The word does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Since the secret word is 5 letters and contains R, we can try to think of words that have R, but not at position 2, and without C,A,N,E.

 We must avoid using C, A, N, E in our next guess.

 We also note that in ""crane"", the R was at position 2. Since it's marked as '-', meaning it's in the word but not at that position, then R must appear in a different position (either 1, 3, 4, or 5).

 However, the feedback does not tell us how many times R appears. It could be once or multiple times? But typically in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, the feedback is tricky. But here we don't have that information.

 Since we have no information about duplicates, we assume the simplest until proven otherwise.

 We need to choose a word that:
 - Does not contain C, A, N, E.
 - Contains R, but R should not be at position 2 (if it were at position 2, it would have been marked as correct, but it's not). So R must be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Also, we want to cover new common letters. Common vowels: we have used A and E, but they are ruled out. Remaining vowels: O, I, U, sometimes Y (but we don't know if Y is used). Also common consonants: S, T, L, B, etc.

 Let me think of words that contain R and use common letters we haven't tried.

 We have ruled out: C, A, N, E.

 We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should aim for words that have vowels (like O or I) and common consonants.

 Example: ""SPORT"" -> but R is at position 3? In ""SPORT"": S P O R T. R is at position 4? Actually, 4th letter.

 Another: ""ROUND"" -> but R is at position 1? However, we have R at position 1? But we know R is not at position 2 from previous, but position 1 is possible.

 However, note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked present but wrong position. That means R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, it might be correct if that's where it belongs.

 Let's think: we don't know the position of R, so we can try to put it in a new position.

 Also, we need to cover more letters.

 I think a good choice might be ""SPIRE"", but E is ruled out.

 ""SPIRE"" has E, which is ruled out. So avoid E.

 Another word: ""ROOMY"" - but R at position 1, O at 2 and 3, Y at 5? But we don't know about duplicates? Avoiding duplicates might be better for now.

 Alternatively, ""RISKY"" - but R at position 1.

 Since R must be in the word, and we haven't tried many letters, let's try a word with R at position 1 and then new letters.

 How about ""ROBOT""? But R is at 1. But we haven't tested B and T? But O is a vowel we haven't tried.

 But note: we have to avoid A, E, C, N.

 ""ROBOT"": R O B O T -> O repeated? Duplicates might complicate.

 How about ""ROAST"" - but A is ruled out? So we cannot use A.

 We need a word without A and without C, N, E.

 Let me consider: ""GROUP"" - G R O U P -> R at position 2? But we must avoid R at position 2 because in the previous guess R at position 2 was marked as wrong position? Actually, we are allowed to use R in any position but we know the secret word has R and position 2 is not correct. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would be again marked '-' if the secret word doesn't have R at position 2? Actually, if the secret word has R only once and not at 2, then using R at position 2 again would still be marked as '-'. But if the secret word has two R's, it might be different? We don't want to complicate.

 To maximize information, we should put R in a position we haven't tried. We tried position 2 already. So let's avoid position 2 and try R at a new position, say 1 or 3 or 4 or 5.

 How about a word with R at position 4? Like ""ABOUT"" - but A and O? A is ruled out! So no.

 How about ""LURKS""? However, we haven't tried L,U,K,S.

 But the word must be 5 letters without A, C, E, N.

 ""LURKS"" is a word: L U R K S -> R at position 3? Actually, positions: L(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), S(5).

 That could work? But we haven't tested the vowel U.

 Or ""WORDS"": W O R D S -> R at position 3? O is a vowel we need? But what are the vowels? O and sometimes W and Y.

 Alternatively, let's try a more balanced word: let's use a word with R at position 1 and then test new common letters.

 Example: ""ROILS"": R O I L S -> but R at 1, O at 2? We haven't tried O and I. Also L and S.

 But note: we have R at position 1. We know from the first feedback that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if the secret word has R at position 1, then in this guess we might get ✓ for R.

 Alternatively, if R is at position 3,4, or 5, then putting R at position 1 would still be marked as '-' (if not position 1) and we learn that position 1 is not R.

 Another word: ""TRIPS"" - T R I P S -> but R at position 2? We want to avoid the position we already tried? This would put R at position 2 again, which we know is not correct? Actually, we cannot avoid completely? But in the previous feedback, R was in the word but not at 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would only be correct if there is another R? But maybe the word has two R's? We don't know.

 To avoid confusion, it might be better not to reuse R in position 2? Or it doesn't matter? Actually, we can use it to test for multiple R's? But that might be overcomplicate for the second guess.

 Since we have limited chances, we should avoid using R in the same position we already know is wrong? Actually, we already know position 2 is wrong for R, so in the next guess, if we put R in position 2 and get '-', then we learn nothing new? Because in the secret word R is not at position 2, so if we put R at 2, regardless of how many R's, if there is only one R and it's not at 2, then it would be '-'. If there are two R's and one of them is at 2? But the secret word has R but not at position 2? Then what? Actually, the feedback would still mark it as '-' if there is an R elsewhere but not at 2? Or if the secret word has two R's, then if we put R in position 2, but the secret word has an R at position 2? But we know it doesn't because the first feedback said R was present but not at position 2. Therefore, position 2 cannot be R? So we don't expect R at position 2 to ever be ✓.

 Therefore, to save a position, we should not put R at position 2 again? Or we can? But we would get the same '-' and waste a position? So we should try to put R in a position we haven't tried? That is, position 1,3,4, or5.

 Moreover, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 With that, let's choose a word that:
 - Places R at position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5.
 - Contains common letters we haven't tried (like O, I, S, T, L, etc.)

 How about ""PARTY""? But A and Y? A is ruled out? So no.

 ""FIRST"": F I R S T -> R at position 3? That's good. And we test F, I, S, T? But I is a vowel. And S, T are common.

 However, we haven't tried I and F? F is actually less common? Maybe we can avoid F? How about ""SHIRT"" - S H I R T -> R at position 4? H and I? Or ""STORM"" - S T O R M -> R at position 4? And we get O as a vowel? Also R is at position 4? Then we learn about R at position 4 and position 2? Also, we avoid A, C, E, N.

 Another word: ""SPORT"" - S P O R T -> R at position 4? So we test S, P, O, R, T? Without duplicates? That seems good.

 But note we already know R is in the word? So putting R again is okay? We are confirming its position? We want to see if R is at position 4? If it is, we get ✓ at position 4? Or if it's at 1 or 3? Then we might get '-' at position 4? And then we have more information.

 So I think ""SPORT"" is a good candidate? But SPORT: S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

 Also, it does not contain any of the discarded letters (C,A,N,E).

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that puts R at position 1? To see if that's the spot? Like ""ROBOT""? But it has O repeated? Or ""ROOMY""? Better avoid duplicates? Then ""ROBIN""? But N is ruled out? So no.

 Or ""RUSTS""? But duplicate S and U? And T? 

 Let's check ""SPORT"": it has the advantage of testing P as well? But P is common? Or not? But S, T, O are very common? So I think it's a solid choice.

 But wait, what if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we wouldn't learn from ""SPORT""? Actually, if R is at position 1, then in ""SPORT"", R wouldn't be in position 1? We are putting R at 4? Then it would be marked as '-'? But then we know R is not at 4? And we still have R at other positions to try? So we can then try position 1 next time? That's acceptable.

 Similarly, if R is at position 4, then we get ✓ on R? That's good? So either way we learn.

 So I will go with ""SPORT"".

 Let me confirm: 
 SPORT: letters S, P, O, R, T? All new? Yes, except R.

 And no duplicates.

 And it's a valid English word.

 So guess: SPORT

<guess>sport</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where:
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked ""x"")
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"")

I deduced that:
1. The secret word contains the letter R, but not at position 2.
2. Letters C, A, N, and E are eliminated, so the next guess must avoid these.
3. To maximize information, I prioritized:
   - Testing R in new positions (1, 3, 4, or 5) since position 2 is already known to be incorrect.
   - Introducing new common vowels and consonants not yet tested (e.g., O, I, S, T).
   - Avoiding duplicates to simplify feedback.

I considered words like ""FIRST"" (R at position 3), ""SHIRT"" (R at position 4), and ""SPORT"" (R at position 4). Choosing ""SPORT"" as the next guess because:
- It places R at position 4 (an untested position).
- It introduces new common consonants (S, P, T) and a new vowel (O).
- It avoids the eliminated letters (C, A, N, E) and duplicates.

If R is at position 4 in the secret word, this will confirm its correct position. Otherwise, feedback on R (e.g., ""-"" or ""x"") will further narrow its location. Other positions (S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5) will test four new letters.

<guess>sport</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the second guess ""sport"":
 S(x) -> S is not in the word
 P(x) -> P is not in the word
 O(-) -> O is in the word but not in the third position
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not in the fourth position
 T(-) -> T is in the word but not in the fifth position

 From the first guess, we already knew:
   R is in the word but not at position 2.

 Now we know:
   O is in the word, but not at position 3.
   R is in the word, but not at position 4 (and we already knew not at 2).
   T is in the word, but not at position 5.
   S and P are not in the word.

 Also, from the first guess, we know that C, A, N, E are not in the word.

 So, eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, S, P.

 We have confirmed letters: R, O, T.

 We know the word contains R, O, T, and two more letters.

 The positions we know are wrong for:
   R: position 2 and 4
   O: position 3
   T: position 5

 We have to consider the possible positions for R, O, T.

 Since the word is 5 letters, and we have three confirmed letters, we need to find two more.

 We also know that the secret word does not have: C, A, N, E, S, P.

 We have not yet tried many letters. Let's list the available common consonants and vowels.

 Vowels left: I, U (and sometimes Y, but we'll consider it a consonant or vowel as needed)
 Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to form a word that has R, O, T and two other letters from the available set.

 Also, we must place R, O, T in positions that are not forbidden for them.

 For R: cannot be at 2 or 4 -> possible positions: 1, 3, 5.
 For O: cannot be at 3 -> possible positions: 1, 2, 4, 5.
 For T: cannot be at 5 -> possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.

 Now, we need to think of words that have R, O, T and two other letters, avoiding the eliminated ones.

 Let's try to think of common words.

 Example: ""VOTER"" -> but E is eliminated? E is out, so no.
 ""MOTOR"" -> has O repeated? and R at the end? But we have T? No, ""MOTOR"" doesn't have T? Actually, M O T O R? That's 5 letters: M, O, T, O, R -> but O repeated? And T at position 3? But we have two O's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the word ""MOTOR"" is valid? However, we have to consider that the feedback might not indicate duplicate letters clearly? But in standard Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky? We should avoid duplicates for now? But if the secret word has duplicates, we have to account for that? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far? So we can try without duplicates first.

 Another word: ""FORTY"" -> F O R T Y -> letters: F, O, R, T, Y? This has no duplicates? And F and Y are new? Also, O at position 2, R at 3, T at 4? But we have to check the forbidden positions.

 For O: position 2 is allowed? Yes, because we only know it's not at 3.
 For R: position 3 is allowed? We know R cannot be at 2 or 4? Position 3 is not forbidden? So yes.
 For T: position 4 is allowed? We know T cannot be at 5? Position 4 is allowed.

 So ""FORTY"" seems possible? But we don't know if F and Y are in the word? We are going to test them.

 But note: we are making a guess to get more information? We know R, O, T are in the word? So we can try to place them in positions that are possible? And test two new letters? F and Y.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word might have one of these letters? We don't know? So we can try.

 Another possibility: ""DOGMA"" -> but A is eliminated? No.

 ""BROTH"" -> B R O T H? This has R at position 2? But wait, we know R cannot be at position 2? Because in the first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position? So R cannot be at position 2? Therefore, ""BROTH"" would have R at position 2? That is forbidden? So we cannot use R at position 2? So ""BROTH"" is invalid? Because we know R is not at 2? So we must avoid putting R at 2? Similarly, we must avoid O at 3 and T at 5? But in ""BROTH"", O is at 3? And we know O cannot be at 3? So that's also forbidden? So ""BROTH"" is not a good choice.

 How about ""THROW""? T H R O W? 
 Positions: T at 1, H at 2, R at 3, O at 4, W at 5.
 Check:
   R at 3: allowed? Yes, because R cannot be at 2 or 4? 3 is okay.
   O at 4: allowed? We know O cannot be at 3? 4 is okay? Yes.
   T at 1: allowed? We know T cannot be at 5? 1 is okay? Yes.

 So ""THROW"" uses T, H, R, O, W? And H and W are new? Also, no duplicates? And we avoid eliminated letters? Yes, because C,A,N,E,S,P are out? H and W are not eliminated? So we can test H and W.

 But note: we have T at position 1? We don't know if T is at 1? It might be? And we are testing R at 3 and O at 4? Also, we get to test H and W.

 Alternatively, ""GROWL"" -> G R O W L? But R at position 2? We know R cannot be at 2? So no.

 ""TROOP"" -> T R O O P? But P is eliminated? And O repeated? So no.

 ""FORTY"" as I thought earlier: F at 1, O at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? 
   O at 2: allowed? Yes? 
   R at 3: allowed? Yes? 
   T at 4: allowed? Yes? 
   But we have T at 4? We know T cannot be at 5? But 4 is allowed? And we are testing F and Y.

 But note: in ""FORTY"", we are putting T at position 4? But we also have to consider that T might be at 4? But we don't know? We are testing it? If T is at 4, then we get a ✓? Otherwise, we get a '-'? And we learn.

 Similarly, for ""THROW"": T at 1, H at 2, R at 3, O at 4, W at 5? 
   We are testing T at 1? If T is at 1, we get ✓? Otherwise, we get feedback? Similarly for others.

 Which one to choose? Both are valid? We need to choose one that covers more common letters? Or that might be the word? 

 But note: we have two letters to find? Actually, we know the word has R, O, T and two others? So we are trying to guess the two others and the positions.

 Another word: ""ROWTH""? Is that a word? Not common? ""GROWL"" is a word but R at 2? Not allowed? 

 How about ""MORTY""? M O R T Y? 
   O at 1? Then R at 3? T at 4? 
   Positions: M(1)? O at 2? Actually, M O R T Y: M at 1, O at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? 
   Then O at 2: allowed? Yes? 
   R at 3: allowed? Yes? 
   T at 4: allowed? Yes? 
   So same as ""FORTY"" but with M instead of F? 

 We can choose between F, M, H, W, etc? 

 But we want to test letters that are more common? 

 Common consonants: H, D, L, M, W, etc? F and Y are less common? 

 So ""THROW"" might be better? Because H and W are common? 

 Also, ""THROW"" tests T at position 1? Which we haven't tested before? And we know T is in the word? So if T is at 1, we get a ✓? Otherwise, we get a '-'? 

 Similarly, in ""FORTY"", we test T at 4? 

 But we don't know which position T is in? So both are valid? 

 However, we have to consider that in the first guess, we had no correct positions? And in the second guess, we had no correct positions? So it's likely that the positions we are trying for R, O, T are not correct? But we don't know? 

 I think ""THROW"" is a good candidate? 

 But let's check the feedback we have: 
   In the first guess, R was at position 2 and was present? So R is not at 2? 
   In the second guess, O was at 3 and was present? So O is not at 3? 
   R was at 4 and was present? So R is not at 4? 
   T was at 5 and was present? So T is not at 5? 

 So for R, the only positions left are 1, 3, 5? 
   In ""THROW"", we put R at 3? 
   If R is at 3, then we get a ✓? 
   If not, then we get a '-'? 

 Similarly, for O, we put at 4? 
   If O is at 4, then ✓? 
   If not, then '-'? 

 And for T, we put at 1? 
   If T is at 1, then ✓? 
   If not, then '-'? 

 So we are testing three positions? That might be efficient? 

 Alternatively, in ""FORTY"", we put O at 2, R at 3, T at 4? 
   We are testing O at 2, R at 3, T at 4? 

 But we don't test T at 1? 

 Since we have more positions to test for T? We know T is not at 5? So it could be at 1,2,3,4? 

 But in ""THROW"", we test T at 1? 

 I think ""THROW"" is a better choice because it tests T at a new position (1) that we haven't tested? 

 Also, we test H and W? 

 So I'll go with ""THROW"". 

 But note: we must avoid the eliminated letters? H and W are not eliminated? 

 So guess: THROW

 However, let me double-check: 
   First guess: crane -> eliminated C, A, N, E? 
   Second guess: sport -> eliminated S, P? 
   So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 
   And we know R, O, T are in the word? 

 So ""THROW"" uses T, H, R, O, W? All are available? 

 Yes.

<guess>throw</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the second guess ""sport"":
- **S(x)** and **P(x)**: S and P are not in the secret word.
- **O(-)**: O is in the word but not at position 3.
- **R(-)**: R is in the word but not at position 4 (and we already knew it's not at position 2 from the first guess).
- **T(-)**: T is in the word but not at position 5.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters**: R, O, T are in the secret word.
2. **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E (from first guess) + S, P (from second guess). Total eliminated: C, A, N, E, S, P.
3. **Position constraints**:
   - R cannot be at positions 2 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 3, or 5.
   - O cannot be at position 3 → possible positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5.
   - T cannot be at position 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 4.
4. **Goal for the next guess**: 
   - Test R, O, T in new positions to narrow down their locations.
   - Introduce new common letters (avoiding eliminated ones) to identify the remaining 2 letters.

### Why ""THROW""?
- **Position testing**:
  - T at position 1 (tests if T is at the start, which is a new position).
  - R at position 3 (tests a new position for R, avoiding 2 and 4).
  - O at position 4 (tests a new position for O, avoiding 3).
- **New letters tested**: H (common consonant) and W (common consonant), both not yet tried.
- **Avoids duplicates and eliminated letters**: Uses distinct letters (T, H, R, O, W) and skips C, A, N, E, S, P.
- **Efficiency**: Tests 3 confirmed letters in untested positions while probing 2 new letters. This maximizes information gain regardless of whether the positions are correct.

If ""THROW"" is correct, we solve the puzzle. If not, feedback on T (position 1), H (position 2), R (position 3), O (position 4), and W (position 5) will significantly narrow possibilities for the next guess.

Avoiding duplicates might be better for now.\n\n Alternatively, ""RISKY"" - but R at position 1.\n\n Since R must be in the word, and we haven\'t tried many letters, let\'s try a word with R at position 1 and then new letters.\n\n How about ""ROBOT""? But R is at 1. But we haven\'t tested B and T? But O is a vowel we haven\'t tried.\n\n But note: we have to avoid A, E, C, N.\n\n ""ROBOT"": R O B O T -> O repeated? Duplicates might complicate.\n\n How about ""ROAST"" - but A is ruled out? So we cannot use A.\n\n We need a word without A and without C, N, E.\n\n Let me consider: ""GROUP"" - G R O U P -> R at position 2? But we must avoid R at position 2 because in the previous guess R at position 2 was marked as wrong position? Actually, we are allowed to use R in any position but we know the secret word has R and position 2 is not correct. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would be again marked \'-\' if the secret word doesn\'t have R at position 2? Actually, if the secret word has R only once and not at 2, then using R at position 2 again would still be marked as \'-\'. But if the secret word has two R\'s, it might be different? We don\'t want to complicate.\n\n To maximize information, we should put R in a position we haven\'t tried. We tried position 2 already. So let\'s avoid position 2 and try R at a new position, say 1 or 3 or 4 or 5.\n\n How about a word with R at position 4? Like ""ABOUT"" - but A and O? A is ruled out! So no.\n\n How about ""LURKS""? However, we haven\'t tried L,U,K,S.\n\n But the word must be 5 letters without A, C, E, N.\n\n ""LURKS"" is a word: L U R K S -> R at position 3? Actually, positions: L(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), S(5).\n\n That could work? But we haven\'t tested the vowel U.\n\n Or ""WORDS"": W O R D S -> R at position 3? O is a vowel we need? But what are the vowels? O and sometimes W and Y.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s try a more balanced word: let\'s use a word with R at position 1 and then test new common letters.\n\n Example: ""ROILS"": R O I L S -> but R at 1, O at 2? We haven\'t tried O and I. Also L and S.\n\n But note: we have R at position 1. We know from the first feedback that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if the secret word has R at position 1, then in this guess we might get ✓ for R.\n\n Alternatively, if R is at position 3,4, or 5, then putting R at position 1 would still be marked as \'-\' (if not position 1) and we learn that position 1 is not R.\n\n Another word: ""TRIPS"" - T R I P S -> but R at position 2? We want to avoid the position we already tried? This would put R at position 2 again, which we know is not correct? Actually, we cannot avoid completely? But in the previous feedback, R was in the word but not at 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would only be correct if there is another R? But maybe the word has two R\'s? We don\'t know.\n\n To avoid confusion, it might be better not to reuse R in position 2? Or it doesn\'t matter? Actually, we can use it to test for multiple R\'s? But that might be overcomplicate for the second guess.\n\n Since we have limited chances, we should avoid using R in the same position we already know is wrong? Actually, we already know position 2 is wrong for R, so in the next guess, if we put R in position 2 and get \'-\', then we learn nothing new? Because in the secret word R is not at position 2, so if we put R at 2, regardless of how many R\'s, if there is only one R and it\'s not at 2, then it would be \'-\'. If there are two R\'s and one of them is at 2? But the secret word has R but not at position 2? Then what? Actually, the feedback would still mark it as \'-\' if there is an R elsewhere but not at 2? Or if the secret word has two R\'s, then if we put R in position 2, but the secret word has an R at position 2? But we know it doesn\'t because the first feedback said R was present but not at position 2. Therefore, position 2 cannot be R? So we don\'t expect R at position 2 to ever be ✓.\n\n Therefore, to save a position, we should not put R at position 2 again? Or we can? But we would get the same \'-\' and waste a position? So we should try to put R in a position we haven\'t tried? That is, position 1,3,4, or5.\n\n Moreover, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n With that, let\'s choose a word that:\n - Places R at position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5.\n - Contains common letters we haven\'t tried (like O, I, S, T, L, etc.)\n\n How about ""PARTY""? But A and Y? A is ruled out? So no.\n\n ""FIRST"": F I R S T -> R at position 3? That\'s good. And we test F, I, S, T? But I is a vowel. And S, T are common.\n\n However, we haven\'t tried I and F? F is actually less common? Maybe we can avoid F? How about ""SHIRT"" - S H I R T -> R at position 4? H and I? Or ""STORM"" - S T O R M -> R at position 4? And we get O as a vowel? Also R is at position 4? Then we learn about R at position 4 and position 2? Also, we avoid A, C, E, N.\n\n Another word: ""SPORT"" - S P O R T -> R at position 4? So we test S, P, O, R, T? Without duplicates? That seems good.\n\n But note we already know R is in the word? So putting R again is okay? We are confirming its position? We want to see if R is at position 4? If it is, we get ✓ at position 4? Or if it\'s at 1 or 3? Then we might get \'-\' at position 4? And then we have more information.\n\n So I think ""SPORT"" is a good candidate? But SPORT: S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5.\n\n Also, it does not contain any of the discarded letters (C,A,N,E).\n\n Alternatively, we might choose a word that puts R at position 1? To see if that\'s the spot? Like ""ROBOT""? But it has O repeated? Or ""ROOMY""? Better avoid duplicates? Then ""ROBIN""? But N is ruled out? So no.\n\n Or ""RUSTS""? But duplicate S and U? And T? \n\n Let\'s check ""SPORT"": it has the advantage of testing P as well? But P is common? Or not? But S, T, O are very common? So I think it\'s a solid choice.\n\n But wait, what if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we wouldn\'t learn from ""SPORT""? Actually, if R is at position 1, then in ""SPORT"", R wouldn\'t be in position 1? We are putting R at 4? Then it would be marked as \'-\'? But then we know R is not at 4? And we still have R at other positions to try? So we can then try position 1 next time? That\'s acceptable.\n\n Similarly, if R is at position 4, then we get ✓ on R? That\'s good? So either way we learn.\n\n So I will go with ""SPORT"".\n\n Let me confirm: \n SPORT: letters S, P, O, R, T? All new? Yes, except R.\n\n And no duplicates.\n\n And it\'s a valid English word.\n\n So guess: SPORT\n\n<guess>sport</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where:\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked ""x"")\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"")\n\nI deduced that:\n1. The secret word contains the letter R, but not at position 2.\n2. Letters C, A, N, and E are eliminated, so the next guess must avoid these.\n3. To maximize information, I prioritized:\n   - Testing R in new positions (1, 3, 4, or 5) since position 2 is already known to be incorrect.\n   - Introducing new common vowels and consonants not yet tested (e.g., O, I, S, T).\n   - Avoiding duplicates to simplify feedback.\n\nI considered words like ""FIRST"" (R at position 3), ""SHIRT"" (R at position 4), and ""SPORT"" (R at position 4). Choosing ""SPORT"" as the next guess because:\n- It places R at position 4 (an untested position).\n- It introduces new common consonants (S, P, T) and a new vowel (O).\n- It avoids the eliminated letters (C, A, N, E) and duplicates.\n\nIf R is at position 4 in the secret word, this will confirm its correct position. Otherwise, feedback on R (e.g., ""-"" or ""x"") will further narrow its location. Other positions (S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5) will test four new letters.\n\n<guess>sport</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the second guess ""sport"":\n S(x) -> S is not in the word\n P(x) -> P is not in the word\n O(-) -> O is in the word but not in the third position\n R(-) -> R is in the word but not in the fourth position\n T(-) -> T is in the word but not in the fifth position\n\n From the first guess, we already knew:\n   R is in the word but not at position 2.\n\n Now we know:\n   O is in the word, but not at position 3.\n   R is in the word, but not at position 4 (and we already knew not at 2).\n   T is in the word, but not at position 5.\n   S and P are not in the word.\n\n Also, from the first guess, we know that C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\n So, eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, S, P.\n\n We have confirmed letters: R, O, T.\n\n We know the word contains R, O, T, and two more letters.\n\n The positions we know are wrong for:\n   R: position 2 and 4\n   O: position 3\n   T: position 5\n\n We have to consider the possible positions for R, O, T.\n\n Since the word is 5 letters, and we have three confirmed letters, we need to find two more.\n\n We also know that the secret word does not have: C, A, N, E, S, P.\n\n We have not yet tried many letters. Let\'s list the available common consonants and vowels.\n\n Vowels left: I, U (and sometimes Y, but we\'ll consider it a consonant or vowel as needed)\n Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We need to form a word that has R, O, T and two other letters from the available set.\n\n Also, we must place R, O, T in positions that are not forbidden for them.\n\n For R: cannot be at 2 or 4 -> possible positions: 1, 3, 5.\n For O: cannot be at 3 -> possible positions: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n For T: cannot be at 5 -> possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n Now, we need to think of words that have R, O, T and two other letters, avoiding the eliminated ones.\n\n Let\'s try to think of common words.\n\n Example: ""VOTER"" -> but E is eliminated? E is out, so no.\n ""MOTOR"" -> has O repeated? and R at the end? But we have T? No, ""MOTOR"" doesn\'t have T? Actually, M O T O R? That\'s 5 letters: M, O, T, O, R -> but O repeated? And T at position 3? But we have two O\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But the word ""MOTOR"" is valid? However, we have to consider that the feedback might not indicate duplicate letters clearly? But in standard Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky? We should avoid duplicates for now? But if the secret word has duplicates, we have to account for that? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far? So we can try without duplicates first.\n\n Another word: ""FORTY"" -> F O R T Y -> letters: F, O, R, T, Y? This has no duplicates? And F and Y are new? Also, O at position 2, R at 3, T at 4? But we have to check the forbidden positions.\n\n For O: position 2 is allowed? Yes, because we only know it\'s not at 3.\n For R: position 3 is allowed? We know R cannot be at 2 or 4? Position 3 is not forbidden? So yes.\n For T: position 4 is allowed? We know T cannot be at 5? Position 4 is allowed.\n\n So ""FORTY"" seems possible? But we don\'t know if F and Y are in the word? We are going to test them.\n\n But note: we are making a guess to get more information? We know R, O, T are in the word? So we can try to place them in positions that are possible? And test two new letters? F and Y.\n\n However, we have to consider that the secret word might have one of these letters? We don\'t know? So we can try.\n\n Another possibility: ""DOGMA"" -> but A is eliminated? No.\n\n ""BROTH"" -> B R O T H? This has R at position 2? But wait, we know R cannot be at position 2? Because in the first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position? So R cannot be at position 2? Therefore, ""BROTH"" would have R at position 2? That is forbidden? So we cannot use R at position 2? So ""BROTH"" is invalid? Because we know R is not at 2? So we must avoid putting R at 2? Similarly, we must avoid O at 3 and T at 5? But in ""BROTH"", O is at 3? And we know O cannot be at 3? So that\'s also forbidden? So ""BROTH"" is not a good choice.\n\n How about ""THROW""? T H R O W? \n Positions: T at 1, H at 2, R at 3, O at 4, W at 5.\n Check:\n   R at 3: allowed? Yes, because R cannot be at 2 or 4? 3 is okay.\n   O at 4: allowed? We know O cannot be at 3? 4 is okay?

But we also have to consider that T might be at 4? But we don\'t know? We are testing it? If T is at 4, then we get a ✓? Otherwise, we get a \'-\'? And we learn.\n\n Similarly, for ""THROW"": T at 1, H at 2, R at 3, O at 4, W at 5? \n   We are testing T at 1? If T is at 1, we get ✓? Otherwise, we get feedback? Similarly for others.\n\n Which one to choose? Both are valid? We need to choose one that covers more common letters? Or that might be the word? \n\n But note: we have two letters to find? Actually, we know the word has R, O, T and two others? So we are trying to guess the two others and the positions.\n\n Another word: ""ROWTH""? Is that a word? Not common? ""GROWL"" is a word but R at 2? Not allowed? \n\n How about ""MORTY""? M O R T Y? \n   O at 1? Then R at 3? T at 4? \n   Positions: M(1)? O at 2? Actually, M O R T Y: M at 1, O at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? \n   Then O at 2: allowed? Yes? \n   R at 3: allowed? Yes? \n   T at 4: allowed? Yes? \n   So same as ""FORTY"" but with M instead of F? \n\n We can choose between F, M, H, W, etc? \n\n But we want to test letters that are more common? \n\n Common consonants: H, D, L, M, W, etc? F and Y are less common? \n\n So ""THROW"" might be better? Because H and W are common? \n\n Also, ""THROW"" tests T at position 1? Which we haven\'t tested before? And we know T is in the word? So if T is at 1, we get a ✓? Otherwise, we get a \'-\'? \n\n Similarly, in ""FORTY"", we test T at 4? \n\n But we don\'t know which position T is in? So both are valid? \n\n However, we have to consider that in the first guess, we had no correct positions? And in the second guess, we had no correct positions? So it\'s likely that the positions we are trying for R, O, T are not correct? But we don\'t know? \n\n I think ""THROW"" is a good candidate? \n\n But let\'s check the feedback we have: \n   In the first guess, R was at position 2 and was present? So R is not at 2? \n   In the second guess, O was at 3 and was present? So O is not at 3? \n   R was at 4 and was present? So R is not at 4? \n   T was at 5 and was present? So T is not at 5? \n\n So for R, the only positions left are 1, 3, 5? \n   In ""THROW"", we put R at 3? \n   If R is at 3, then we get a ✓? \n   If not, then we get a \'-\'? \n\n Similarly, for O, we put at 4? \n   If O is at 4, then ✓? \n   If not, then \'-\'? \n\n And for T, we put at 1? \n   If T is at 1, then ✓? \n   If not, then \'-\'? \n\n So we are testing three positions? That might be efficient? \n\n Alternatively, in ""FORTY"", we put O at 2, R at 3, T at 4? \n   We are testing O at 2, R at 3, T at 4? \n\n But we don\'t test T at 1? \n\n Since we have more positions to test for T? We know T is not at 5? So it could be at 1,2,3,4? \n\n But in ""THROW"", we test T at 1? \n\n I think ""THROW"" is a better choice because it tests T at a new position (1) that we haven\'t tested? \n\n Also, we test H and W? \n\n So I\'ll go with ""THROW"". \n\n But note: we must avoid the eliminated letters? H and W are not eliminated? \n\n So guess: THROW\n\n However, let me double-check: \n   First guess: crane -> eliminated C, A, N, E? \n   Second guess: sport -> eliminated S, P? \n   So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? \n   And we know R, O, T are in the word? \n\n So ""THROW"" uses T, H, R, O, W?

This maximizes information gain regardless of whether the positions are correct.\n\nIf ""THROW"" is correct, we solve the puzzle. If not, feedback on T (position 1), H (position 2), R (position 3), O (position 4), and W (position 5) will significantly narrow possibilities for the next guess.\n\n<guess>throw</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)\nGuess 3: throw -> FEEDBACK: T(-) H(x) R(-) O(✓) W(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the third guess ""throw"":
 T(-) -> T is in the word but not at position 1
 H(x) -> H is not in the word
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not at position 3
 O(✓) -> O is in the word and at the correct position, which is position 4 (since in ""throw"", O is the 4th letter)
 W(x) -> W is not in the word

 So, to summarize:
 - O is confirmed to be at position 4.
 - T is in the word but not at position 1.
 - R is in the word but not at position 3 (and we already knew not at 2 or 4, so R cannot be at 2,3,4 -> only positions 1 or 5 left for R).
 - H and W are not in the word.

 Also, from previous guesses, we have eliminated: C, A, N, E, S, P, H, W.

 We have confirmed letters: R, O, T (and O is at position 4).

 We know the word has R, O, T, and two more letters that are not in the eliminated set.

 Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, H, W.

 Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

 We also have position constraints:
 - O is fixed at position 4.
 - R must be at position 1 or 5 (since 2,3,4 are ruled out).
 - T is in the word but not at position 1, and we know it cannot be at position 5 (from guess 2: T was at 5 and was marked as not in position, but present? Actually, in guess 2: T was at position 5 and marked as '-', meaning present but not at 5. So T cannot be at 5. Also, in guess 3, T was at position 1 and marked as '-', so T cannot be at 1. Therefore, T must be at position 2 or 3? Because positions 1 and 5 are ruled out? And we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

 Let me list the forbidden positions for T:
 - From guess 2: T was at position 5 -> marked '-' -> so T is not at 5.
 - From guess 3: T was at position 1 -> marked '-' -> so T is not at 1.
 - Therefore, T must be at position 2 or 3.

 Similarly, for R:
 - From guess 1: R at position 2 -> '-' -> not at 2.
 - From guess 2: R at position 4 -> '-' -> not at 4.
 - From guess 3: R at position 3 -> '-' -> not at 3.
 - So R must be at position 1 or 5.

 Now, the word structure:
 Position 4: O (fixed).

 So we have:
 Position 1: either R or one of the two unknown letters? But R can be at 1 or 5? And T must be at 2 or 3.

 Also, we have two more letters to find? Actually, we have three confirmed letters: R, O, T? But O is fixed at 4, and R and T are in the word? So the word has R, T, O, and two more letters? But we don't know if R and T are distinct? They are? So we have two more letters to find? 

 The word: [pos1] [pos2] [pos3] [O] [pos5]

 Constraints:
 - pos1: can be R or a new letter? But if R is at pos1, then one of the new letters is at pos5? Or if R is at pos5, then pos1 is a new letter? Similarly, T must be at pos2 or pos3? So we have two cases.

 We need to form a word that fits.

 Also, the two unknown letters are from the available set: B,D,F,G,I,K,L,M,Q,U,V,X,Y,Z.

 Now, we can think of words that have O at position 4, and contain R and T, with R at 1 or 5, and T at 2 or 3.

 Let me list possible words:

 Case 1: R at position 1, T at position 2:
   Word: R T ? O ? 
   The third letter and fifth letter are unknown? But we have two more letters? So the word is R T X O Y, where X and Y are from the available set? And the word must be valid.

 Case 2: R at position 1, T at position 3:
   Word: R ? T O ?

 Case 3: R at position 5, T at position 2:
   Word: ? T ? O R

 Case 4: R at position 5, T at position 3:
   Word: ? ? T O R

 We need to fill in the blanks with two letters from the available set? And form a valid English word.

 Let's think of common words:

 Case 1: R T ? O ? 
   Example: ""R T I O ?"" -> but we need a fifth letter? Like ""R T I O N"" -> but N is eliminated? No.
   ""R T O O ?"" -> duplicate O? But O is at position 4? So we cannot have O at position 3? Because we have to put a letter at position 3? And O is fixed at 4? So position 3 cannot be O? Because we have only one O? Or could there be two O's? We don't know? But in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate? So we assume no duplicates? But we must be cautious? However, in the feedback for ""throw"", we had O at position 4 and it was correct? And we had no other O? So if there were two O's, we might have seen a '-' for another O? But we didn't? So probably only one O? So we assume no duplicate O? Similarly, for R and T? We don't know? But we have to consider? 

 But to keep it simple, let's assume no duplicates? Because we haven't encountered any duplicate feedback? 

 So for case 1: R T ? O ? 
   We need a word that starts with ""RT"", then a letter (not O, and not eliminated), then ""O"", then a letter? 
   Common words: ""R T I O ?"" -> but we need a fifth letter? Actually, 5-letter word? ""R T I O N"" is 5 letters? But N is eliminated? 
   ""R T O O M"" -> but O at position 3? But we have O at position 4? And we are assuming no duplicate? So no? 
   ""R T A O K"" -> A eliminated? 
   ""R T U O ?"" -> ""R T U O R""? duplicate R? Not allowed? 
   I can't think of a common word? 

 Case 2: R ? T O ? 
   Word: R X T O Y, where X and Y are available letters? 
   Example: ""R I T O ?"" -> ""R I T O R""? duplicate R? 
   ""R I T O S"" -> S eliminated? 
   ""R U T O N"" -> N eliminated? 
   ""R O T O R"" -> duplicate R and O? 
   Not many common words? 

 Case 3: ? T ? O R 
   Word: X T Y O R 
   Example: ""M T Y O R"" -> ""motor""? But we have O at position 4? And we are putting O at position 4? But ""motor"" is M O T O R? That's not matching? Because we have T at position 2? So ""M T ? O R"" -> what can be at position 3? 
   ""A T O O R"" -> duplicate O? 
   ""I T E O R"" -> E eliminated? 
   ""U T I O R"" -> U, T, I, O, R? That's ""UTIOR""? Not a word? 
   ""V T O O R"" -> duplicate O? 
   How about ""D T Y O R""? Not a word? 

 Case 4: ? ? T O R 
   Word: X Y T O R 
   This is a common ending? Like ""votor""? Not? ""motor"" is M O T O R? But that has O at position 2? 
   Actually, ""motor"" is M at 1, O at 2, T at 3, O at 4, R at 5? But we have O fixed at position 4? So in ""motor"", position 4 is O? That matches? But position 2 is O? And we have T at position 3? 
   But we have constraints on T: T must be at 2 or 3? In ""motor"", T is at 3? So that's allowed? 
   But what about the O at position 2? We know O is at position 4? But if there is another O at position 2? Then we would have duplicate O? 
   In the feedback for ""throw"", we had O at position 4 and it was correct? But we didn't have O at position 2? So we don't know if there is an O at position 2? 
   However, in the second guess ""sport"", we had O at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position? That means there is an O in the word? But we now know it's at position 4? So if there were an O at position 2, then in ""sport"" we would have two O's? But in ""sport"", we only had one O? And the feedback for O was for position 3? And it was marked as present? But if there is an O at position 2 and 4? Then in ""sport"", we have O at position 3? That is not matching? So the feedback would mark the O at position 3 as present? But it doesn't tell us about the duplicate? Actually, in Wordle, if there is a duplicate, the feedback might mark the first occurrence? But it's complicated? 

   Let me recall: in ""sport"", we had O at position 3? And it was marked as '-'? That means there is an O in the word, but not at position 3? And we now know that O is at position 4? So if there were an O at position 2, then in ""sport"", we have O at position 3? The feedback would still mark one O as present? But it doesn't specify which one? Actually, the feedback for ""sport"" was: O(-) meaning the O at position 3 is present but not at that position? So if there is an O at position 2, then the O at position 3 is not the same? But the feedback doesn't tell us about the O at position 2? Because we didn't have a letter at position 2? 

   Actually, in ""sport"", we had:
     S(1) P(2) O(3) R(4) T(5)
   Feedback: O(-) for position 3? That means the O is in the word but not at 3? So if the secret word has an O at position 2, then we didn't test position 2? So we wouldn't know? 

   But in the third guess ""throw"", we had:
     T(1) H(2) R(3) O(4) W(5)
   We got O(✓) at position 4? And we didn't have a letter at position 2? So if the secret word has an O at position 2, we wouldn't have tested it? But we know O is at position 4? So if there is an O at position 2, then the word has two O's? 

   However, in the feedback for ""throw"", we only got one O marked? And it was at position 4? So if there were an O at position 2, then we should have gotten a '-' for the O at position 2? But we didn't have a letter at position 2? We had H at position 2? So we didn't test position 2? 

   Therefore, it is possible that there is an O at position 2? But we don't know? 

   But in the word ""motor"", we have O at position 2 and 4? So it is possible? 

   However, we have to consider that in the first guess, we had A at position 3? And it was not in the word? And in the second guess, we had O at position 3? And it was present but not at 3? So if the secret word is ""motor"", then in the second guess ""sport"", we have O at position 3? But the secret word has O at positions 2 and 4? So the feedback for ""sport"" would mark the O at position 3 as present? Because there is an O in the word? But not at 3? So it would be '-'? And that matches? 

   Also, in the third guess ""throw"", we have O at position 4? And it is correct? And we don't have a letter at position 2? So we don't know about position 2? 

   Therefore, ""motor"" is a candidate? But we have eliminated P? And ""motor"" has M, O, T, O, R? M is not eliminated? T is in the word? R is in the word? O is in the word? 

   But we have T at position 3? And we know T must be at 2 or 3? So that's allowed? 

   And R at position 5? And we know R must be at 1 or 5? So that's allowed? 

   And O at position 4? Correct? 

   But we have O at position 2? That's a duplicate? And we haven't tested position 2? 

   So ""motor"" is a possible word? 

   But we also have other possibilities? 

   Let's list possible words for case 4: ? ? T O R 
   With O at position 4? So the word is [1] [2] T O R 

   And we know T is at position 3? So the word is [1] [2] T O R 

   And the first two letters are from the available set? And not eliminated? 

   Common words: 
     ""M O T O R"" -> but then position 2 is O? So the word is M at 1, O at 2, T at 3, O at 4, R at 5? 
     But we have O at position 2 and 4? 

   Other words: 
     ""C A T O R"" -> C and A eliminated? 
     ""D O T O R"" -> duplicate O? 
     ""F A T O R"" -> A eliminated? 
     ""B O T O R"" -> duplicate O? 
     ""L O T O R"" -> duplicate O? 
     ""V O T O R"" -> duplicate O? 

   What about without duplicate? 
     ""I T O R"" is not 5 letters? 
     ""A T O R"" not 5? 
     We need two letters before T? 

   Actually, the structure is [1] [2] T O R? So the first two letters are two consonants? Or one vowel and one consonant? 

   Example: ""D E T O R"" -> E eliminated? 
     ""B L T O R"" -> ""bltor"" not a word? 
     ""F L T O R"" -> no? 
     ""G L T O R"" -> no? 
     ""K N T O R"" -> N eliminated? 
     ""Q U T O R"" -> ""qutor"" not a word? 
     ""V I T O R"" -> ""vitor"" not common? 

   So ""motor"" seems the most common? 

   But we have another case: case 3: ? T ? O R 
   Which is [1] T [3] O R 
   And we know T is at position 2? 
   So the word is X T Y O R 

   Example: ""A T A O R"" -> A eliminated? 
     ""E T I O R"" -> E eliminated? 
     ""I T E O R"" -> E eliminated? 
     ""O T I O R"" -> duplicate O? 
     ""U T I O R"" -> ""utior"" not a word? 
     ""M T O O R"" -> duplicate O? 
     ""B T O O R"" -> duplicate O? 

   Not many common words? 

   What about case 2: R ? T O ? 
   R at 1, T at 3, O at 4, and then a letter at 2 and 5? 
   Word: R X T O Y 
   Example: ""R I T O R"" -> duplicate R? 
     ""R I T O S"" -> S eliminated? 
     ""R U T O R"" -> duplicate R? 
     ""R O T O R"" -> duplicate R and O? 
     ""R A T O N"" -> A and N eliminated? 
     ""R E T O D"" -> E eliminated? 

   Case 1: R T ? O ? 
   ""R T I O N"" -> N eliminated? 
   ""R T I O S"" -> S eliminated? 
   ""R T O O M"" -> duplicate O? 

   So the only common word I can think of is ""motor"", which is case 4: ? ? T O R, with the first two letters being M and O? 

   But in ""motor"", we have O at position 2? And we haven't tested that? 

   We also have to consider that we might have missed a word? 

   Another possibility: what if R is at position 1 and T at position 3? And the word is ""R ? T O ?"" 
   How about ""R I T O U"" -> ""ritou"" not a word? 
   Or ""R I T O L"" -> ""ritol"" not a word? 

   Or maybe ""R U T O G"" -> no? 

   Another idea: the word might have a duplicate T? But we haven't seen any indication? 

   Let's list all possible positions:

   We have:
     Position 1: R or an unknown letter (if R is at 5)
     Position 2: T or an unknown letter (if T is at 3)
     Position 3: T or an unknown letter (if T is at 2)
     Position 4: O (fixed)
     Position 5: R or an unknown letter (if R is at 1)

   And we have two more letters to place? But if R is at 1, then position 5 is an unknown letter? And if T is at 2, then position 3 is an unknown letter? Etc.

   Given the difficulty, and since ""motor"" is a common word, let's try ""motor""? 

   But note: in ""motor"", we have:
     M at 1, O at 2, T at 3, O at 4, R at 5.

   We know:
     O is at position 4? Correct? 
     T is at position 3? And we know T must be at 2 or 3? So that's allowed? 
     R is at position 5? And we know R must be at 1 or 5? So that's allowed? 

   But we have O at position 2? We haven't tested that? But it's possible? 

   Also, we have not eliminated M? 

   So let's guess ""motor"".

   But wait, we have to consider the feedback we might get? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests new letters? But we are running out of guesses? 

   We have 3 guesses left? 

   But if we guess ""motor"", and it's correct, we win? If not, we get feedback? 

   But there might be other words? 

   Another word: ""rotor""? But that's R O T O R? 
     R at 1, O at 2, T at 3, O at 4, R at 5? 
     But we have duplicate R and duplicate O? 
     And R at 1: allowed? 
     O at 2: not tested? 
     T at 3: allowed? 
     O at 4: correct? 
     R at 5: allowed? 
     But we have duplicate R? And we haven't seen any duplicate feedback? 

   In the first guess, we had one R? In the second guess, one R? In the third guess, one R? So if there are two R's, we might have seen a second R marked? But in the feedback, we only got one R marked each time? So probably only one R? 

   Similarly for O? In the second guess, we had one O? In the third guess, one O? So probably only one O? 

   Therefore, ""motor"" has two O's? So it might not be? 

   But in ""motor"", we have two O's? So if we guess ""motor"", and the secret word has only one O (at position 4), then the feedback for the O at position 2 would be marked as not in the word? Or as present but we already have one O? 

   In Wordle, if there is one O in the secret word and you guess two O's, then one of them will be marked as not in the word? Or if one is in the correct position, the other might be marked as not in the word? 

   Specifically, for ""motor"" if the secret word has only one O at position 4, then:
     Position 2: O -> not in the word (because the only O is at 4, and we already used it) -> marked as 'x'
     Position 4: O -> correct -> marked as '✓'
     But we have two O's in the guess? The feedback will mark the first O (at position 2) as not in the word? And the second O (at position 4) as correct? 

   But in our case, we know there is at least one O? And we have it at position 4? So if there is only one O, then the O at position 2 would be marked as 'x'? 

   But if there are two O's, then both might be marked? 

   However, we have no evidence of two O's? 

   Given the complexity, perhaps we should avoid assuming duplicates? 

   Let me think of words without duplicates? 

   We have the structure with R at 1 or 5, T at 2 or 3, O at 4, and two new letters? 

   And no duplicates? 

   For example, case 3: ? T ? O R 
   Word: X T Y O R 
   We need a word that is X T Y O R, with X and Y from available letters? 

   Example: ""B T I O R"" -> ""btior"" not a word? 
   ""D T I O R"" -> ""dtior"" not a word? 
   ""F T I O R"" -> ""ftior"" not a word? 
   ""G T I O R"" -> ""gtior"" not a word? 
   ""K T I O R"" -> ""ktior"" not a word? 
   ""L T I O R"" -> ""ltior"" not a word? 
   ""M T I O R"" -> ""mtior"" not a word? 
   ""V T I O R"" -> ""vtior"" not a word? 

   How about ""A T L O R"" -> A eliminated? 
   ""I T L O R"" -> ""itlor"" not a word? 
   ""U T L O R"" -> ""utlor"" not a word? 

   Or ""D T O O R"" -> duplicate O? 

   Case 4: ? ? T O R 
   With T at position 3? 
   Word: X Y T O R 
   Example: ""D O T O R"" -> duplicate O? 
   ""L O T O R"" -> duplicate O? 
   ""M O T O R"" -> duplicate O? 

   Without O at position 2? 
   ""B L T O R"" -> ""bltor"" not a word? 
   ""C L T O R"" -> C eliminated? 
   ""F L T O R"" -> ""fltor"" not a word? 
   ""G L T O R"" -> ""gltor"" not a word? 
   ""K L T O R"" -> ""kltor"" not a word? 
   ""V L T O R"" -> ""vltor"" not a word? 
   ""B R T O R"" -> duplicate R? 
   ""D R T O R"" -> duplicate R? 

   Case 2: R ? T O ? 
   R at 1, then a letter, then T at 3, O at 4, then a letter? 
   Word: R X T O Y 
   Example: ""R U T O R"" -> duplicate R? 
   ""R I T O L"" -> ""ritol"" not a word? 
   ""R I T O N"" -> N eliminated? 
   ""R I T O S"" -> S eliminated? 
   ""R I T O D"" -> ""ritod"" not a word? 
   ""R A T O M"" -> A eliminated? 
   ""R E T O P"" -> E and P eliminated? 

   Case 1: R T ? O ? 
   ""R T I O D"" -> ""rtiod"" not a word? 
   ""R T I O L"" -> ""rtiol"" not a word? 
   ""R T I O V"" -> ""rtiov"" not a word? 

   I am considering that there might be a word with U? 

   How about ""R O T O"" something? 

   Another idea: the word might be ""voter"" but E is eliminated? 

   Or ""doter"" -> E eliminated? 

   Perhaps ""motor"" is the only common word? 

   Or ""rotor""? 

   But let's check the available letters: we have M available? 

   And ""motor"" is a valid word? 

   Given the constraints, I think we should try ""motor"". 

   But to be safe, let's consider if there is a word with R at position 1 and T at position 2? 

   ""R T O O M"" -> duplicate O? 

   ""R T O O D"" -> duplicate O? 

   Not common. 

   Or with R at position 5 and T at position 2: 
   Word: ? T ? O R 
   ""I T C O R"" -> C eliminated? 
   ""A T O O R"" -> duplicate O? 

   So I think ""motor"" is our best bet? 

   Let's guess ""motor"". 

   But note: in ""motor"", we have O at position 2? We haven't tested that position for O? But it's possible? 

   And we have not eliminated M? 

   So I'll go with ""motor"".

### Analysis of Feedback from Guess 3 (""throw""):
- **T(-)**: T is in the secret word but **not at position 1**.
- **H(x)**: H is **not** in the word.
- **R(-)**: R is in the word but **not at position 3**.
- **O(✓)**: O is **correct and at position 4**.
- **W(x)**: W is **not** in the word.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters and positions**:
   - **O is fixed at position 4**.
   - **R** is in the word but cannot be at positions 2, 3, or 4 (from prior feedback). Thus, R must be at **position 1 or 5**.
   - **T** is in the word but cannot be at positions 1 or 5 (from feedback). Thus, T must be at **position 2 or 3**.
   - **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E (from Guess 1), S, P (from Guess 2), and now H, W (from Guess 3). Total: **C, A, N, E, S, P, H, W**.
   - **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

2. **Word structure**:
   - Position 4 is fixed as **O**.
   - Positions for R (1 or 5) and T (2 or 3) must be assigned, with the remaining positions filled by two new letters from the available set.
   - Given the constraints, the only common English word that fits is **""MOTOR""**:
     - **M** at position 1 (new letter, not eliminated).
     - **O** at position 2 (possible, as O's position 4 is fixed but duplicates are unconfirmed; this tests for a second O).
     - **T** at position 3 (allowed, as T must be at 2 or 3).
     - **O** at position 4 (confirmed correct).
     - **R** at position 5 (allowed, as R must be at 1 or 5).

### Why ""MOTOR""?
- Tests the only plausible common word matching all constraints.
- If correct, it solves the puzzle.
- If incorrect, feedback on **M** (position 1), **O** (position 2), and **R** (position 5) will definitively reveal:
  - Whether duplicates exist (e.g., if O at position 2 is marked ""x"", the word has only one O).
  - The true positions of R and T.
  - Validity of M as a letter.

<guess>motor</guess>",motor,"We have feedback from the third guess ""throw"":
 T(-) -> T is in the word but not at position 1
 H(x) -> H is not in the word
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not at position 3
 O(✓) -> O is in the word and at the correct position, which is position 4 (since in ""throw"", O is the 4th letter)
 W(x) -> W is not in the word

 So, to summarize:
 - O is confirmed to be at position 4.
 - T is in the word but not at position 1.
 - R is in the word but not at position 3 (and we already knew not at 2 or 4, so R cannot be at 2,3,4 -> only positions 1 or 5 left for R).
 - H and W are not in the word.

 Also, from previous guesses, we have eliminated: C, A, N, E, S, P, H, W.

 We have confirmed letters: R, O, T (and O is at position 4).

 We know the word has R, O, T, and two more letters that are not in the eliminated set.

 Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, H, W.

 Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

 We also have position constraints:
 - O is fixed at position 4.
 - R must be at position 1 or 5 (since 2,3,4 are ruled out).
 - T is in the word but not at position 1, and we know it cannot be at position 5 (from guess 2: T was at 5 and was marked as not in position, but present? Actually, in guess 2: T was at position 5 and marked as '-', meaning present but not at 5. So T cannot be at 5. Also, in guess 3, T was at position 1 and marked as '-', so T cannot be at 1. Therefore, T must be at position 2 or 3? Because positions 1 and 5 are ruled out? And we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

 Let me list the forbidden positions for T:
 - From guess 2: T was at position 5 -> marked '-' -> so T is not at 5.
 - From guess 3: T was at position 1 -> marked '-' -> so T is not at 1.
 - Therefore, T must be at position 2 or 3.

 Similarly, for R:
 - From guess 1: R at position 2 -> '-' -> not at 2.
 - From guess 2: R at position 4 -> '-' -> not at 4.
 - From guess 3: R at position 3 -> '-' -> not at 3.
 - So R must be at position 1 or 5.

 Now, the word structure:
 Position 4: O (fixed).

 So we have:
 Position 1: either R or one of the two unknown letters? But R can be at 1 or 5? And T must be at 2 or 3.

 Also, we have two more letters to find? Actually, we have three confirmed letters: R, O, T? But O is fixed at 4, and R and T are in the word? So the word has R, T, O, and two more letters? But we don't know if R and T are distinct? They are? So we have two more letters to find? 

 The word: [pos1] [pos2] [pos3] [O] [pos5]

 Constraints:
 - pos1: can be R or a new letter? But if R is at pos1, then one of the new letters is at pos5? Or if R is at pos5, then pos1 is a new letter? Similarly, T must be at pos2 or pos3? So we have two cases.

 We need to form a word that fits.

 Also, the two unknown letters are from the available set: B,D,F,G,I,K,L,M,Q,U,V,X,Y,Z.

 Now, we can think of words that have O at position 4, and contain R and T, with R at 1 or 5, and T at 2 or 3.

 Let me list possible words:

 Case 1: R at position 1, T at position 2:
   Word: R T ? O ? 
   The third letter and fifth letter are unknown? But we have two more letters? So the word is R T X O Y, where X and Y are from the available set? And the word must be valid.

 Case 2: R at position 1, T at position 3:
   Word: R ? T O ?

 Case 3: R at position 5, T at position 2:
   Word: ? T ? O R

 Case 4: R at position 5, T at position 3:
   Word: ? ? T O R

 We need to fill in the blanks with two letters from the available set? And form a valid English word.

 Let's think of common words:

 Case 1: R T ? O ? 
   Example: ""R T I O ?"" -> but we need a fifth letter? Like ""R T I O N"" -> but N is eliminated? No.
   ""R T O O ?"" -> duplicate O? But O is at position 4? So we cannot have O at position 3? Because we have to put a letter at position 3? And O is fixed at 4? So position 3 cannot be O? Because we have only one O? Or could there be two O's? We don't know? But in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate? So we assume no duplicates? But we must be cautious? However, in the feedback for ""throw"", we had O at position 4 and it was correct? And we had no other O? So if there were two O's, we might have seen a '-' for another O? But we didn't? So probably only one O? So we assume no duplicate O? Similarly, for R and T? We don't know? But we have to consider? 

 But to keep it simple, let's assume no duplicates? Because we haven't encountered any duplicate feedback? 

 So for case 1: R T ? O ? 
   We need a word that starts with ""RT"", then a letter (not O, and not eliminated), then ""O"", then a letter? 
   Common words: ""R T I O ?"" -> but we need a fifth letter? Actually, 5-letter word? ""R T I O N"" is 5 letters? But N is eliminated? 
   ""R T O O M"" -> but O at position 3? But we have O at position 4? And we are assuming no duplicate? So no? 
   ""R T A O K"" -> A eliminated? 
   ""R T U O ?"" -> ""R T U O R""? duplicate R? Not allowed? 
   I can't think of a common word? 

 Case 2: R ? T O ? 
   Word: R X T O Y, where X and Y are available letters? 
   Example: ""R I T O ?"" -> ""R I T O R""? duplicate R? 
   ""R I T O S"" -> S eliminated? 
   ""R U T O N"" -> N eliminated? 
   ""R O T O R"" -> duplicate R and O? 
   Not many common words? 

 Case 3: ? T ? O R 
   Word: X T Y O R 
   Example: ""M T Y O R"" -> ""motor""? But we have O at position 4? And we are putting O at position 4? But ""motor"" is M O T O R? That's not matching? Because we have T at position 2? So ""M T ? O R"" -> what can be at position 3? 
   ""A T O O R"" -> duplicate O? 
   ""I T E O R"" -> E eliminated? 
   ""U T I O R"" -> U, T, I, O, R? That's ""UTIOR""? Not a word? 
   ""V T O O R"" -> duplicate O? 
   How about ""D T Y O R""? Not a word? 

 Case 4: ? ? T O R 
   Word: X Y T O R 
   This is a common ending? Like ""votor""? Not? ""motor"" is M O T O R? But that has O at position 2? 
   Actually, ""motor"" is M at 1, O at 2, T at 3, O at 4, R at 5? But we have O fixed at position 4? So in ""motor"", position 4 is O? That matches? But position 2 is O? And we have T at position 3? 
   But we have constraints on T: T must be at 2 or 3? In ""motor"", T is at 3? So that's allowed? 
   But what about the O at position 2? We know O is at position 4? But if there is another O at position 2? Then we would have duplicate O? 
   In the feedback for ""throw"", we had O at position 4 and it was correct? But we didn't have O at position 2? So we don't know if there is an O at position 2? 
   However, in the second guess ""sport"", we had O at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position? That means there is an O in the word? But we now know it's at position 4? So if there were an O at position 2, then in ""sport"" we would have two O's? But in ""sport"", we only had one O? And the feedback for O was for position 3? And it was marked as present? But if there is an O at position 2 and 4? Then in ""sport"", we have O at position 3? That is not matching? So the feedback would mark the O at position 3 as present? But it doesn't tell us about the duplicate? Actually, in Wordle, if there is a duplicate, the feedback might mark the first occurrence? But it's complicated? 

   Let me recall: in ""sport"", we had O at position 3? And it was marked as '-'? That means there is an O in the word, but not at position 3? And we now know that O is at position 4? So if there were an O at position 2, then in ""sport"", we have O at position 3? The feedback would still mark one O as present? But it doesn't specify which one? Actually, the feedback for ""sport"" was: O(-) meaning the O at position 3 is present but not at that position? So if there is an O at position 2, then the O at position 3 is not the same? But the feedback doesn't tell us about the O at position 2? Because we didn't have a letter at position 2? 

   Actually, in ""sport"", we had:
     S(1) P(2) O(3) R(4) T(5)
   Feedback: O(-) for position 3? That means the O is in the word but not at 3? So if the secret word has an O at position 2, then we didn't test position 2? So we wouldn't know? 

   But in the third guess ""throw"", we had:
     T(1) H(2) R(3) O(4) W(5)
   We got O(✓) at position 4? And we didn't have a letter at position 2? So if the secret word has an O at position 2, we wouldn't have tested it? But we know O is at position 4? So if there is an O at position 2, then the word has two O's? 

   However, in the feedback for ""throw"", we only got one O marked? And it was at position 4? So if there were an O at position 2, then we should have gotten a '-' for the O at position 2? But we didn't have a letter at position 2? We had H at position 2? So we didn't test position 2? 

   Therefore, it is possible that there is an O at position 2? But we don't know? 

   But in the word ""motor"", we have O at position 2 and 4? So it is possible? 

   However, we have to consider that in the first guess, we had A at position 3? And it was not in the word? And in the second guess, we had O at position 3? And it was present but not at 3? So if the secret word is ""motor"", then in the second guess ""sport"", we have O at position 3? But the secret word has O at positions 2 and 4? So the feedback for ""sport"" would mark the O at position 3 as present? Because there is an O in the word? But not at 3? So it would be '-'? And that matches? 

   Also, in the third guess ""throw"", we have O at position 4? And it is correct? And we don't have a letter at position 2? So we don't know about position 2? 

   Therefore, ""motor"" is a candidate? But we have eliminated P? And ""motor"" has M, O, T, O, R? M is not eliminated? T is in the word? R is in the word? O is in the word? 

   But we have T at position 3? And we know T must be at 2 or 3? So that's allowed? 

   And R at position 5? And we know R must be at 1 or 5? So that's allowed? 

   And O at position 4? Correct? 

   But we have O at position 2? That's a duplicate? And we haven't tested position 2? 

   So ""motor"" is a possible word? 

   But we also have other possibilities? 

   Let's list possible words for case 4: ? ? T O R 
   With O at position 4? So the word is [1] [2] T O R 

   And we know T is at position 3? So the word is [1] [2] T O R 

   And the first two letters are from the available set? And not eliminated? 

   Common words: 
     ""M O T O R"" -> but then position 2 is O? So the word is M at 1, O at 2, T at 3, O at 4, R at 5? 
     But we have O at position 2 and 4? 

   Other words: 
     ""C A T O R"" -> C and A eliminated? 
     ""D O T O R"" -> duplicate O? 
     ""F A T O R"" -> A eliminated? 
     ""B O T O R"" -> duplicate O? 
     ""L O T O R"" -> duplicate O? 
     ""V O T O R"" -> duplicate O? 

   What about without duplicate? 
     ""I T O R"" is not 5 letters? 
     ""A T O R"" not 5? 
     We need two letters before T? 

   Actually, the structure is [1] [2] T O R? So the first two letters are two consonants? Or one vowel and one consonant? 

   Example: ""D E T O R"" -> E eliminated? 
     ""B L T O R"" -> ""bltor"" not a word? 
     ""F L T O R"" -> no? 
     ""G L T O R"" -> no? 
     ""K N T O R"" -> N eliminated? 
     ""Q U T O R"" -> ""qutor"" not a word? 
     ""V I T O R"" -> ""vitor"" not common? 

   So ""motor"" seems the most common? 

   But we have another case: case 3: ? T ? O R 
   Which is [1] T [3] O R 
   And we know T is at position 2? 
   So the word is X T Y O R 

   Example: ""A T A O R"" -> A eliminated? 
     ""E T I O R"" -> E eliminated? 
     ""I T E O R"" -> E eliminated? 
     ""O T I O R"" -> duplicate O? 
     ""U T I O R"" -> ""utior"" not a word? 
     ""M T O O R"" -> duplicate O? 
     ""B T O O R"" -> duplicate O? 

   Not many common words? 

   What about case 2: R ? T O ? 
   R at 1, T at 3, O at 4, and then a letter at 2 and 5? 
   Word: R X T O Y 
   Example: ""R I T O R"" -> duplicate R? 
     ""R I T O S"" -> S eliminated? 
     ""R U T O R"" -> duplicate R? 
     ""R O T O R"" -> duplicate R and O? 
     ""R A T O N"" -> A and N eliminated? 
     ""R E T O D"" -> E eliminated? 

   Case 1: R T ? O ? 
   ""R T I O N"" -> N eliminated? 
   ""R T I O S"" -> S eliminated? 
   ""R T O O M"" -> duplicate O? 

   So the only common word I can think of is ""motor"", which is case 4: ? ? T O R, with the first two letters being M and O? 

   But in ""motor"", we have O at position 2? And we haven't tested that? 

   We also have to consider that we might have missed a word? 

   Another possibility: what if R is at position 1 and T at position 3? And the word is ""R ? T O ?"" 
   How about ""R I T O U"" -> ""ritou"" not a word? 
   Or ""R I T O L"" -> ""ritol"" not a word? 

   Or maybe ""R U T O G"" -> no? 

   Another idea: the word might have a duplicate T? But we haven't seen any indication? 

   Let's list all possible positions:

   We have:
     Position 1: R or an unknown letter (if R is at 5)
     Position 2: T or an unknown letter (if T is at 3)
     Position 3: T or an unknown letter (if T is at 2)
     Position 4: O (fixed)
     Position 5: R or an unknown letter (if R is at 1)

   And we have two more letters to place? But if R is at 1, then position 5 is an unknown letter? And if T is at 2, then position 3 is an unknown letter? Etc.

   Given the difficulty, and since ""motor"" is a common word, let's try ""motor""? 

   But note: in ""motor"", we have:
     M at 1, O at 2, T at 3, O at 4, R at 5.

   We know:
     O is at position 4? Correct? 
     T is at position 3? And we know T must be at 2 or 3? So that's allowed? 
     R is at position 5? And we know R must be at 1 or 5? So that's allowed? 

   But we have O at position 2? We haven't tested that? But it's possible? 

   Also, we have not eliminated M? 

   So let's guess ""motor"".

   But wait, we have to consider the feedback we might get? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests new letters? But we are running out of guesses? 

   We have 3 guesses left? 

   But if we guess ""motor"", and it's correct, we win? If not, we get feedback? 

   But there might be other words? 

   Another word: ""rotor""? But that's R O T O R? 
     R at 1, O at 2, T at 3, O at 4, R at 5? 
     But we have duplicate R and duplicate O? 
     And R at 1: allowed? 
     O at 2: not tested? 
     T at 3: allowed? 
     O at 4: correct? 
     R at 5: allowed? 
     But we have duplicate R? And we haven't seen any duplicate feedback? 

   In the first guess, we had one R? In the second guess, one R? In the third guess, one R? So if there are two R's, we might have seen a second R marked? But in the feedback, we only got one R marked each time? So probably only one R? 

   Similarly for O? In the second guess, we had one O? In the third guess, one O? So probably only one O? 

   Therefore, ""motor"" has two O's? So it might not be? 

   But in ""motor"", we have two O's? So if we guess ""motor"", and the secret word has only one O (at position 4), then the feedback for the O at position 2 would be marked as not in the word? Or as present but we already have one O? 

   In Wordle, if there is one O in the secret word and you guess two O's, then one of them will be marked as not in the word? Or if one is in the correct position, the other might be marked as not in the word? 

   Specifically, for ""motor"" if the secret word has only one O at position 4, then:
     Position 2: O -> not in the word (because the only O is at 4, and we already used it) -> marked as 'x'
     Position 4: O -> correct -> marked as '✓'
     But we have two O's in the guess? The feedback will mark the first O (at position 2) as not in the word? And the second O (at position 4) as correct? 

   But in our case, we know there is at least one O? And we have it at position 4? So if there is only one O, then the O at position 2 would be marked as 'x'? 

   But if there are two O's, then both might be marked? 

   However, we have no evidence of two O's? 

   Given the complexity, perhaps we should avoid assuming duplicates? 

   Let me think of words without duplicates? 

   We have the structure with R at 1 or 5, T at 2 or 3, O at 4, and two new letters? 

   And no duplicates? 

   For example, case 3: ? T ? O R 
   Word: X T Y O R 
   We need a word that is X T Y O R, with X and Y from available letters? 

   Example: ""B T I O R"" -> ""btior"" not a word? 
   ""D T I O R"" -> ""dtior"" not a word? 
   ""F T I O R"" -> ""ftior"" not a word? 
   ""G T I O R"" -> ""gtior"" not a word? 
   ""K T I O R"" -> ""ktior"" not a word? 
   ""L T I O R"" -> ""ltior"" not a word? 
   ""M T I O R"" -> ""mtior"" not a word? 
   ""V T I O R"" -> ""vtior"" not a word? 

   How about ""A T L O R"" -> A eliminated? 
   ""I T L O R"" -> ""itlor"" not a word? 
   ""U T L O R"" -> ""utlor"" not a word? 

   Or ""D T O O R"" -> duplicate O? 

   Case 4: ? ? T O R 
   With T at position 3? 
   Word: X Y T O R 
   Example: ""D O T O R"" -> duplicate O? 
   ""L O T O R"" -> duplicate O? 
   ""M O T O R"" -> duplicate O? 

   Without O at position 2? 
   ""B L T O R"" -> ""bltor"" not a word? 
   ""C L T O R"" -> C eliminated? 
   ""F L T O R"" -> ""fltor"" not a word? 
   ""G L T O R"" -> ""gltor"" not a word? 
   ""K L T O R"" -> ""kltor"" not a word? 
   ""V L T O R"" -> ""vltor"" not a word? 
   ""B R T O R"" -> duplicate R? 
   ""D R T O R"" -> duplicate R? 

   Case 2: R ? T O ? 
   R at 1, then a letter, then T at 3, O at 4, then a letter? 
   Word: R X T O Y 
   Example: ""R U T O R"" -> duplicate R? 
   ""R I T O L"" -> ""ritol"" not a word? 
   ""R I T O N"" -> N eliminated? 
   ""R I T O S"" -> S eliminated? 
   ""R I T O D"" -> ""ritod"" not a word? 
   ""R A T O M"" -> A eliminated? 
   ""R E T O P"" -> E and P eliminated? 

   Case 1: R T ? O ? 
   ""R T I O D"" -> ""rtiod"" not a word? 
   ""R T I O L"" -> ""rtiol"" not a word? 
   ""R T I O V"" -> ""rtiov"" not a word? 

   I am considering that there might be a word with U? 

   How about ""R O T O"" something? 

   Another idea: the word might be ""voter"" but E is eliminated? 

   Or ""doter"" -> E eliminated? 

   Perhaps ""motor"" is the only common word? 

   Or ""rotor""? 

   But let's check the available letters: we have M available? 

   And ""motor"" is a valid word? 

   Given the constraints, I think we should try ""motor"". 

   But to be safe, let's consider if there is a word with R at position 1 and T at position 2? 

   ""R T O O M"" -> duplicate O? 

   ""R T O O D"" -> duplicate O? 

   Not common. 

   Or with R at position 5 and T at position 2: 
   Word: ? T ? O R 
   ""I T C O R"" -> C eliminated? 
   ""A T O O R"" -> duplicate O? 

   So I think ""motor"" is our best bet? 

   Let's guess ""motor"". 

   But note: in ""motor"", we have O at position 2? We haven't tested that position for O? But it's possible? 

   And we have not eliminated M? 

   So I'll go with ""motor"". 

<guess>motor</guess>### Analysis of Feedback from Guess 3 (""throw""):
- **T(-)**: T is in the secret word but **not at position 1**.
- **H(x)**: H is **not** in the word.
- **R(-)**: R is in the word but **not at position 3**.
- **O(✓)**: O is **correct and at position 4**.
- **W(x)**: W is **not** in the word.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters and positions**:
   - **O is fixed at position 4**.
   - **R** is in the word but cannot be at positions 2, 3, or 4 (from prior feedback). Thus, R must be at **position 1 or 5**.
   - **T** is in the word but cannot be at positions 1 or 5 (from feedback). Thus, T must be at **position 2 or 3**.
   - **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E (from Guess 1), S, P (from Guess 2), and now H, W (from Guess 3). Total: **C, A, N, E, S, P, H, W**.
   - **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

2. **Word structure**:
   - Position 4 is fixed as **O**.
   - Positions for R (1 or 5) and T (2 or 3) must be assigned, with the remaining positions filled by two new letters from the available set.
   - Given the constraints, the only common English word that fits is **""MOTOR""**:
     - **M** at position 1 (new letter, not eliminated).
     - **O** at position 2 (possible, as O's position 4 is fixed but duplicates are unconfirmed; this tests for a second O).
     - **T** at position 3 (allowed, as T must be at 2 or 3).
     - **O** at position 4 (confirmed correct).
     - **R** at position 5 (allowed, as R must be at 1 or 5).

### Why ""MOTOR""?
- Tests the only plausible common word matching all constraints.
- If correct, it solves the puzzle.
- If incorrect, feedback on **M** (position 1), **O** (position 2), and **R** (position 5) will definitively reveal:
  - Whether duplicates exist (e.g., if O at position 2 is marked ""x"", the word has only one O).
  - The true positions of R and T.
  - Validity of M as a letter.",Guess 4: motor -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(✓) T(✓) O(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
