We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
 - The letters are all distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x -> not in the secret word
 R: - -> in the word but wrong position
 A: x -> not in the secret word
 N: x -> not in the secret word
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

 Since ""crane"" had R in the second position and E in the fifth, and both are present but in the wrong positions, R cannot be in position 2 and E cannot be in position 5.

 We must now choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Excludes C, A, N (since they are not in the word)
   - Includes R and E (but R not in position 2, and E not in position 5)
   - We can also include other letters to test.

 Let's think of words that have R and E and avoid C, A, N.

 Also, note: the word must have exactly 5 letters.

 Considering common words, let's try to use the letters we know (R, E) and also test other common letters.

 Since R and E are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions.

 Possibilities for R: cannot be at position 2. So it can be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Possibilities for E: cannot be at position 5. So it can be at 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 One idea: since R is in the word and not at position 2, try putting it at the beginning? 
 But note: we don't know if the word has R at position 1 or elsewhere.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R and E in different positions and introduces new common letters.

 We should avoid letters that we haven't tested and also avoid C, A, N.

 Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We can test other vowels: O, I, U? We know A is out so the vowel must be one of the others.

 Example: Let's try the word ""ROUTE""?
   - R at position 1 -> okay because R not at 2? But note: we don't know if position 1 is correct for R, but the feedback only said R is present and in the wrong position in position 2. Wait: our feedback was for R in position 2? In ""crane"", R was in position 2. Therefore, R might be acceptable at position 1? 
   However, the feedback indicates that R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R at position 1, that might be the correct position? Or it might not? We can try.

 But note: we have E in the word, we haven't tested T or O? 

 However, let's check: we must also avoid A, C, N. ""ROUTE"" doesn't have any of these.

 But wait: what about the feedback for E? E was in position 5 in ""crane"" and now we are putting it in position 4? 

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that has R and E and tests more new letters.

 Another common approach is to try to use letters that are frequently in five-letter words.

 Suggested word: ""ROGUE""?
   - R in position 1: if that is correct, we get a ✓, if not, we get a - for R? And we can learn about G and U? 
   But note: we should also test consonants.

 Another idea: ""RESET"" - but note that E appears twice? We don't know if the word has repeated letters? The rules don't prohibit repeated letters? But in the feedback we received, we didn't see any duplicate? So it's safer to avoid duplicates unless necessary? 

 However, let me check: we don't know if the word has repeated letters. But ""reset"" has two E's. And also we are introducing S and T.

 But note: our feedback didn't show any repeated letters? We don't know. So let me avoid repeated letters for now.

 Let's think of words that have R, E, and three new letters.

 Word: ""ROLES"" -> R, O, L, E, S -> no duplicate? 
   R at 1: we'll see if R is at position 1.
   E at position 4? But remember, E cannot be at position 5? We don't know if position 4 is acceptable because the only constraint is that position 5 was wrong? So E could be at 4? 
   This word avoids A, C, N.

 However, we are not yet sure whether O, L, or S are in the word? 

 But note: we have E in the word and we are testing O, L, S.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that places R in a position we haven't tried? In ""crane"", R was at position 2. Now we can try position 1, 3, 4, etc.

 Another common word: ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> has R and E? 
   Positions: 
     R is at position 4 -> we are testing if R is at 4? 
     E is at position 5 -> but wait! Feedback on E in ""crane"" said that E is in the word but not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5 again? That would be redundant and against the rule? 
   Therefore, we must avoid E at position 5.

 So ""STORE"" has E at position 5 -> invalid because we know that E is not at position 5? Actually, we know E is in the word and not at position 5? So putting E at position 5 in a new guess would be a waste? 

 Therefore, avoid E at position 5.

 Alternatively: ""ROLES"": E is at position 4? That's okay? 

 Or ""RESIN"": E at position 2? and R at 1? 
   ""resin"": R at 1, E at 2 -> but note: E is not forbidden at position 2? We don't know? 
   However, we know E is in the word and we haven't tried E at position 2? 

 But wait: we have R at position 1? We can try that? 

 Let me choose ""RESIN"": 
   R at 1 -> we don't know if that's the correct position? 
   E at 2 -> and E was previously at 5? So if E is at 2, we might get a ✓ or a -? 
   S at 3, I at 4, N at 5? But N is already eliminated! We cannot use N because it was in ""crane"" and we were told it's not in the word? 

 So ""RESIN"" has N -> bad, because we know N is not in the word? 

 Similarly, we must avoid A, C, N.

 Therefore, we cannot use N? 

 Then what about ""RESIT""? No N? 
   RESIT: R (1), E (2), S (3), I (4), T (5). 
   Avoids A, C, N.

 But note: we are introducing S, I, T? And E at position 2? 

 We haven't tested S, I, T? 

 Alternatively: ""ROUSE"": 
   R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E at position 5? Avoid E at position 5? 
   Therefore, we cannot use E at 5? 

 How about ""ROUGE"": 
   R(1), O(2), U(3), G(4), E(5) -> again E at 5? 

 How about switching the positions? 
 Can we move E? 

 Example: ""URBIS""? But that's not common? 

 Alternatively: ""PERIL"" -> 
   P(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), L(5)
   - This word has E at position 2 and R at position 3? 
   - Avoids A, C, N? 
   - We introduce P, I, L? 

 This seems good.

 Or ""MERIT"": 
   M(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), T(5)
   E at 2 and R at 3? 

 Also good.

 But note: both E and R are being placed at new positions? 

 However, we don't know if E can be at position 2? Let me recall: in the previous word, E was at position 5 and we were told it is in the wrong position? So E might be at position 2? 

 Similarly, R was at position 2 and now we are moving it? 

 Let me choose ""MERIT"". It has M, E, R, I, T. 
   - Introduces M, I, T? 
   - We know E and R are in the word? 

 So we can learn about M, I, T? 

 Let's see: 
   If we guess ""MERIT"", 
     if M is not in the word, we'll get an x for M? 
     E at position 2: if the word has E at position 2, then ✓, otherwise -?
     R at position 3: we know R is in the word, but was previously at position 2? So if at position 3 is correct, we get ✓? 
     Similarly, I and T? 

 This seems like a reasonable guess? 

 Another candidate: ""PERIL"" -> similar? 

 But note: we haven't tested many letters? 

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters? 

 After removing A, C, N, common letters: E, R, S, T, L, I, O? 

 Why not try a word that has S, T, or L? 

 For example: ""ROLES"" (if we can avoid E at 5? But we can put E at 4? Oh, but ""roles"" has E at position 5? Wait: 
   - R O L E S -> that's the spelling? No: R O L E S -> positions: 
        R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5? 
   Then E is at position 4? Which is acceptable? 

 Yes! So ""ROLES"" has:
   R at 1: testing if R is at 1? 
   O at 2: new letter?
   L at 3: new letter?
   E at 4: testing E at a new position? 
   S at 5: new letter?

 And avoids A, C, N.

 This tests R and E in new positions? 

 We can get information on O, L, S? 

 Compared to ""MERIT"", both are good? But ""roles"" introduces three new letters? So maybe more information? 

 Since we have only 5 more tries? We want as much information as possible? 

 Therefore, let me choose ""ROLES"" for the second guess? 

 Now, let me write ""ROLES"" and expect feedback? 

 We are done? 

 But note: the response format must be: <guess>word</guess>

 So my next guess is ""roles"".

 Let me confirm the spelling: R O L E S -> yes, it's a word meaning parts?

 Therefore, I choose ""roles"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- **C, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked with `x`).  
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked with `-`).  
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked with `-`).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include **R** and **E**, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.  
- Must exclude C, A, N.  
- Should test common letters not yet tried (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to gather new information.  

The word **""ROLES""** fits well:  
- Places R at position 1 (new position, testing if correct).  
- Places E at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).  
- Introduces three new letters: **O**, **L**, and **S**.  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N) and repeated letters.  

This guess maximizes information by testing R and E in new positions while probing new consonants and vowels.

- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked with `-`).  
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked with `-`).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include **R** and **E**, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.  
- Must exclude C, A, N.  
- Should test common letters not yet tried (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to gather new information.  

The word **""ROLES""** fits well:  
- Places R at position 1 (new position, testing if correct).  
- Places E at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).  
- Introduces three new letters: **O**, **L**, and **S**.  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N) and repeated letters.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,exert,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
 - The letters are all distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x -> not in the secret word
 R: - -> in the word but wrong position
 A: x -> not in the secret word
 N: x -> not in the secret word
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

 Since ""crane"" had R in the second position and E in the fifth, and both are present but in the wrong positions, R cannot be in position 2 and E cannot be in position 5.

 We must now choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Excludes C, A, N (since they are not in the word)
   - Includes R and E (but R not in position 2, and E not in position 5)
   - We can also include other letters to test.

 Let's think of words that have R and E and avoid C, A, N.

 Also, note: the word must have exactly 5 letters.

 Considering common words, let's try to use the letters we know (R, E) and also test other common letters.

 Since R and E are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions.

 Possibilities for R: cannot be at position 2. So it can be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Possibilities for E: cannot be at position 5. So it can be at 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 One idea: since R is in the word and not at position 2, try putting it at the beginning? 
 But note: we don't know if the word has R at position 1 or elsewhere.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R and E in different positions and introduces new common letters.

 We should avoid letters that we haven't tested and also avoid C, A, N.

 Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We can test other vowels: O, I, U? We know A is out so the vowel must be one of the others.

 Example: Let's try the word ""ROUTE""?
   - R at position 1 -> okay because R not at 2? But note: we don't know if position 1 is correct for R, but the feedback only said R is present and in the wrong position in position 2. Wait: our feedback was for R in position 2? In ""crane"", R was in position 2. Therefore, R might be acceptable at position 1? 
   However, the feedback indicates that R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R at position 1, that might be the correct position? Or it might not? We can try.

 But note: we have E in the word, we haven't tested T or O? 

 However, let's check: we must also avoid A, C, N. ""ROUTE"" doesn't have any of these.

 But wait: what about the feedback for E? E was in position 5 in ""crane"" and now we are putting it in position 4? 

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that has R and E and tests more new letters.

 Another common approach is to try to use letters that are frequently in five-letter words.

 Suggested word: ""ROGUE""?
   - R in position 1: if that is correct, we get a ✓, if not, we get a - for R? And we can learn about G and U? 
   But note: we should also test consonants.

 Another idea: ""RESET"" - but note that E appears twice? We don't know if the word has repeated letters? The rules don't prohibit repeated letters? But in the feedback we received, we didn't see any duplicate? So it's safer to avoid duplicates unless necessary? 

 However, let me check: we don't know if the word has repeated letters. But ""reset"" has two E's. And also we are introducing S and T.

 But note: our feedback didn't show any repeated letters? We don't know. So let me avoid repeated letters for now.

 Let's think of words that have R, E, and three new letters.

 Word: ""ROLES"" -> R, O, L, E, S -> no duplicate? 
   R at 1: we'll see if R is at position 1.
   E at position 4? But remember, E cannot be at position 5? We don't know if position 4 is acceptable because the only constraint is that position 5 was wrong? So E could be at 4? 
   This word avoids A, C, N.

 However, we are not yet sure whether O, L, or S are in the word? 

 But note: we have E in the word and we are testing O, L, S.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that places R in a position we haven't tried? In ""crane"", R was at position 2. Now we can try position 1, 3, 4, etc.

 Another common word: ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> has R and E? 
   Positions: 
     R is at position 4 -> we are testing if R is at 4? 
     E is at position 5 -> but wait! Feedback on E in ""crane"" said that E is in the word but not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5 again? That would be redundant and against the rule? 
   Therefore, we must avoid E at position 5.

 So ""STORE"" has E at position 5 -> invalid because we know that E is not at position 5? Actually, we know E is in the word and not at position 5? So putting E at position 5 in a new guess would be a waste? 

 Therefore, avoid E at position 5.

 Alternatively: ""ROLES"": E is at position 4? That's okay? 

 Or ""RESIN"": E at position 2? and R at 1? 
   ""resin"": R at 1, E at 2 -> but note: E is not forbidden at position 2? We don't know? 
   However, we know E is in the word and we haven't tried E at position 2? 

 But wait: we have R at position 1? We can try that? 

 Let me choose ""RESIN"": 
   R at 1 -> we don't know if that's the correct position? 
   E at 2 -> and E was previously at 5? So if E is at 2, we might get a ✓ or a -? 
   S at 3, I at 4, N at 5? But N is already eliminated! We cannot use N because it was in ""crane"" and we were told it's not in the word? 

 So ""RESIN"" has N -> bad, because we know N is not in the word? 

 Similarly, we must avoid A, C, N.

 Therefore, we cannot use N? 

 Then what about ""RESIT""? No N? 
   RESIT: R (1), E (2), S (3), I (4), T (5). 
   Avoids A, C, N.

 But note: we are introducing S, I, T? And E at position 2? 

 We haven't tested S, I, T? 

 Alternatively: ""ROUSE"": 
   R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E at position 5? Avoid E at position 5? 
   Therefore, we cannot use E at 5? 

 How about ""ROUGE"": 
   R(1), O(2), U(3), G(4), E(5) -> again E at 5? 

 How about switching the positions? 
 Can we move E? 

 Example: ""URBIS""? But that's not common? 

 Alternatively: ""PERIL"" -> 
   P(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), L(5)
   - This word has E at position 2 and R at position 3? 
   - Avoids A, C, N? 
   - We introduce P, I, L? 

 This seems good.

 Or ""MERIT"": 
   M(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), T(5)
   E at 2 and R at 3? 

 Also good.

 But note: both E and R are being placed at new positions? 

 However, we don't know if E can be at position 2? Let me recall: in the previous word, E was at position 5 and we were told it is in the wrong position? So E might be at position 2? 

 Similarly, R was at position 2 and now we are moving it? 

 Let me choose ""MERIT"". It has M, E, R, I, T. 
   - Introduces M, I, T? 
   - We know E and R are in the word? 

 So we can learn about M, I, T? 

 Let's see: 
   If we guess ""MERIT"", 
     if M is not in the word, we'll get an x for M? 
     E at position 2: if the word has E at position 2, then ✓, otherwise -?
     R at position 3: we know R is in the word, but was previously at position 2? So if at position 3 is correct, we get ✓? 
     Similarly, I and T? 

 This seems like a reasonable guess? 

 Another candidate: ""PERIL"" -> similar? 

 But note: we haven't tested many letters? 

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters? 

 After removing A, C, N, common letters: E, R, S, T, L, I, O? 

 Why not try a word that has S, T, or L? 

 For example: ""ROLES"" (if we can avoid E at 5? But we can put E at 4? Oh, but ""roles"" has E at position 5? Wait: 
   - R O L E S -> that's the spelling? No: R O L E S -> positions: 
        R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5? 
   Then E is at position 4? Which is acceptable? 

 Yes! So ""ROLES"" has:
   R at 1: testing if R is at 1? 
   O at 2: new letter?
   L at 3: new letter?
   E at 4: testing E at a new position? 
   S at 5: new letter?

 And avoids A, C, N.

 This tests R and E in new positions? 

 We can get information on O, L, S? 

 Compared to ""MERIT"", both are good? But ""roles"" introduces three new letters? So maybe more information? 

 Since we have only 5 more tries? We want as much information as possible? 

 Therefore, let me choose ""ROLES"" for the second guess? 

 Now, let me write ""ROLES"" and expect feedback? 

 We are done? 

 But note: the response format must be: <guess>word</guess>

 So my next guess is ""roles"".

 Let me confirm the spelling: R O L E S -> yes, it's a word meaning parts?

 Therefore, I choose ""roles"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- **C, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked with `x`).  
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked with `-`).  
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked with `-`).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include **R** and **E**, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.  
- Must exclude C, A, N.  
- Should test common letters not yet tried (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to gather new information.  

The word **""ROLES""** fits well:  
- Places R at position 1 (new position, testing if correct).  
- Places E at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).  
- Introduces three new letters: **O**, **L**, and **S**.  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N) and repeated letters.  

This guess maximizes information by testing R and E in new positions while probing new consonants and vowels.

We are at the beginning of the game. We have to make our first 5-letter word guess. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters and no duplicates to maximize information. Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. 

Considering the English language, a word with common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S, T) is beneficial. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels and two common consonants, and all letters are distinct. 

Therefore, I choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
 - The letters are all distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x -> not in the secret word
 R: - -> in the word but wrong position
 A: x -> not in the secret word
 N: x -> not in the secret word
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

 Since ""crane"" had R in the second position and E in the fifth, and both are present but in the wrong positions, R cannot be in position 2 and E cannot be in position 5.

 We must now choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Excludes C, A, N (since they are not in the word)
   - Includes R and E (but R not in position 2, and E not in position 5)
   - We can also include other letters to test.

 Let's think of words that have R and E and avoid C, A, N.

 Also, note: the word must have exactly 5 letters.

 Considering common words, let's try to use the letters we know (R, E) and also test other common letters.

 Since R and E are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions.

 Possibilities for R: cannot be at position 2. So it can be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Possibilities for E: cannot be at position 5. So it can be at 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 One idea: since R is in the word and not at position 2, try putting it at the beginning? 
 But note: we don't know if the word has R at position 1 or elsewhere.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R and E in different positions and introduces new common letters.

 We should avoid letters that we haven't tested and also avoid C, A, N.

 Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We can test other vowels: O, I, U? We know A is out so the vowel must be one of the others.

 Example: Let's try the word ""ROUTE""?
   - R at position 1 -> okay because R not at 2? But note: we don't know if position 1 is correct for R, but the feedback only said R is present and in the wrong position in position 2. Wait: our feedback was for R in position 2? In ""crane"", R was in position 2. Therefore, R might be acceptable at position 1? 
   However, the feedback indicates that R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R at position 1, that might be the correct position? Or it might not? We can try.

 But note: we have E in the word, we haven't tested T or O? 

 However, let's check: we must also avoid A, C, N. ""ROUTE"" doesn't have any of these.

 But wait: what about the feedback for E? E was in position 5 in ""crane"" and now we are putting it in position 4? 

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that has R and E and tests more new letters.

 Another common approach is to try to use letters that are frequently in five-letter words.

 Suggested word: ""ROGUE""?
   - R in position 1: if that is correct, we get a ✓, if not, we get a - for R? And we can learn about G and U? 
   But note: we should also test consonants.

 Another idea: ""RESET"" - but note that E appears twice? We don't know if the word has repeated letters? The rules don't prohibit repeated letters? But in the feedback we received, we didn't see any duplicate? So it's safer to avoid duplicates unless necessary? 

 However, let me check: we don't know if the word has repeated letters. But ""reset"" has two E's. And also we are introducing S and T.

 But note: our feedback didn't show any repeated letters? We don't know. So let me avoid repeated letters for now.

 Let's think of words that have R, E, and three new letters.

 Word: ""ROLES"" -> R, O, L, E, S -> no duplicate? 
   R at 1: we'll see if R is at position 1.
   E at position 4? But remember, E cannot be at position 5? We don't know if position 4 is acceptable because the only constraint is that position 5 was wrong? So E could be at 4? 
   This word avoids A, C, N.

 However, we are not yet sure whether O, L, or S are in the word? 

 But note: we have E in the word and we are testing O, L, S.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that places R in a position we haven't tried? In ""crane"", R was at position 2. Now we can try position 1, 3, 4, etc.

 Another common word: ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> has R and E? 
   Positions: 
     R is at position 4 -> we are testing if R is at 4? 
     E is at position 5 -> but wait! Feedback on E in ""crane"" said that E is in the word but not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5 again? That would be redundant and against the rule? 
   Therefore, we must avoid E at position 5.

 So ""STORE"" has E at position 5 -> invalid because we know that E is not at position 5? Actually, we know E is in the word and not at position 5? So putting E at position 5 in a new guess would be a waste? 

 Therefore, avoid E at position 5.

 Alternatively: ""ROLES"": E is at position 4? That's okay? 

 Or ""RESIN"": E at position 2? and R at 1? 
   ""resin"": R at 1, E at 2 -> but note: E is not forbidden at position 2? We don't know? 
   However, we know E is in the word and we haven't tried E at position 2? 

 But wait: we have R at position 1? We can try that? 

 Let me choose ""RESIN"": 
   R at 1 -> we don't know if that's the correct position? 
   E at 2 -> and E was previously at 5? So if E is at 2, we might get a ✓ or a -? 
   S at 3, I at 4, N at 5? But N is already eliminated! We cannot use N because it was in ""crane"" and we were told it's not in the word? 

 So ""RESIN"" has N -> bad, because we know N is not in the word? 

 Similarly, we must avoid A, C, N.

 Therefore, we cannot use N? 

 Then what about ""RESIT""? No N? 
   RESIT: R (1), E (2), S (3), I (4), T (5). 
   Avoids A, C, N.

 But note: we are introducing S, I, T? And E at position 2? 

 We haven't tested S, I, T? 

 Alternatively: ""ROUSE"": 
   R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E at position 5? Avoid E at position 5? 
   Therefore, we cannot use E at 5? 

 How about ""ROUGE"": 
   R(1), O(2), U(3), G(4), E(5) -> again E at 5? 

 How about switching the positions? 
 Can we move E? 

 Example: ""URBIS""? But that's not common? 

 Alternatively: ""PERIL"" -> 
   P(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), L(5)
   - This word has E at position 2 and R at position 3? 
   - Avoids A, C, N? 
   - We introduce P, I, L? 

 This seems good.

 Or ""MERIT"": 
   M(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), T(5)
   E at 2 and R at 3? 

 Also good.

 But note: both E and R are being placed at new positions? 

 However, we don't know if E can be at position 2? Let me recall: in the previous word, E was at position 5 and we were told it is in the wrong position? So E might be at position 2? 

 Similarly, R was at position 2 and now we are moving it? 

 Let me choose ""MERIT"". It has M, E, R, I, T. 
   - Introduces M, I, T? 
   - We know E and R are in the word? 

 So we can learn about M, I, T? 

 Let's see: 
   If we guess ""MERIT"", 
     if M is not in the word, we'll get an x for M? 
     E at position 2: if the word has E at position 2, then ✓, otherwise -?
     R at position 3: we know R is in the word, but was previously at position 2? So if at position 3 is correct, we get ✓? 
     Similarly, I and T? 

 This seems like a reasonable guess? 

 Another candidate: ""PERIL"" -> similar? 

 But note: we haven't tested many letters? 

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters? 

 After removing A, C, N, common letters: E, R, S, T, L, I, O? 

 Why not try a word that has S, T, or L? 

 For example: ""ROLES"" (if we can avoid E at 5? But we can put E at 4? Oh, but ""roles"" has E at position 5? Wait: 
   - R O L E S -> that's the spelling? No: R O L E S -> positions: 
        R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5? 
   Then E is at position 4? Which is acceptable? 

 Yes! So ""ROLES"" has:
   R at 1: testing if R is at 1? 
   O at 2: new letter?
   L at 3: new letter?
   E at 4: testing E at a new position? 
   S at 5: new letter?

 And avoids A, C, N.

 This tests R and E in new positions? 

 We can get information on O, L, S? 

 Compared to ""MERIT"", both are good? But ""roles"" introduces three new letters? So maybe more information? 

 Since we have only 5 more tries? We want as much information as possible? 

 Therefore, let me choose ""ROLES"" for the second guess? 

 Now, let me write ""ROLES"" and expect feedback? 

 We are done? 

 But note: the response format must be: <guess>word</guess>

 So my next guess is ""roles"".

 Let me confirm the spelling: R O L E S -> yes, it's a word meaning parts?

 Therefore, I choose ""roles"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- **C, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked with `x`).  
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked with `-`).  
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked with `-`).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include **R** and **E**, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.  
- Must exclude C, A, N.  
- Should test common letters not yet tried (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to gather new information.  

The word **""ROLES""** fits well:  
- Places R at position 1 (new position, testing if correct).  
- Places E at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).  
- Introduces three new letters: **O**, **L**, and **S**.  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N) and repeated letters.  

This guess maximizes information by testing R and E in new positions while probing new consonants and vowels.

We have two identical feedbacks for ""crane"" in Guess 1 and Guess 3. That's unusual because typically we wouldn't repeat the same guess. But ignoring that, the feedback remains the same.
 Feedback from ""crane"":
   C: not in the word (x)
   R: in the word but wrong position (-)
   A: not in the word (x)
   N: not in the word (x)
   E: in the word but wrong position (-)

 Therefore, the secret word:
   - Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively).
   - Does not contain C, A, or N.

 We must make a new guess that:
   - Is a 5-letter word.
   - Includes R and E (since they are present in the word).
   - Avoids C, A, N.
   - Places R and E in positions different from 2 and 5 respectively? Actually, for E, we know position 5 is wrong, but it could be in other positions? Similarly R cannot be only at position 2? But we haven't tried other positions.

 However, note that the feedback doesn't forbid R from being in position 2 if it's not actually the correct position? We know R is in the word but not in position 2? So we can try R in other positions? And E in other positions?

 Let's think of words that include R and E and avoid C, A, N.

 Example: ""ROLES"" (as I thought earlier) but note that in a previous interaction, I tried ""word"" and it was invalid? So let me be careful with the word choice? Actually the system said ""Model answer is not five letters"" for ""word""? So we must guess a real five-letter word? 

 How about ""ROLES""? It is a five-letter word? 
   R O L E S -> 5 letters? 

 But wait: in the second guess, I wrote ""word"" which is 4 letters? So that was invalid? Therefore, now we must make a valid guess? 

 Let's choose ""ROLES"". Steps:

   R at position 1: testing if R is at 1? (since it wasn't at 2)
   O at position 2: new letter?
   L at position 3: new letter?
   E at position 4: testing E? (previously at 5, so now at 4? Might be correct? Or at least, if it's in the word but not at 5? Maybe 4 is good?
   S at position 5: new letter?

 This will give us information about O, L, S? 

 Alternatively, we can choose ""STORE""? 
   But ""STORE"": 
      S at1, T at2, O at3, R at4, E at5? -> but E at position 5? That is the same position as before? And we were told E is not at position 5? So putting E at position 5 again would be pointless? 

 Actually, the feedback said E is present but not at position 5? So we shouldn't put E at position 5 again? 

 Therefore, avoid E at position 5? 

 Other possibilities: ""REBEL"" -> but E repeated? And B? 
   Wait: repeated E? We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters? But to avoid complication, let's try without repetitions? 

 Another word: ""PERIL"" -> 
   P E R I L? 
      E at position 2: which we haven't tried? 

 Let me compare:

   ""ROLES"": tests positions: R(1), E(4)
   ""PERIL"": tests positions: E(2), R(3) 

 Both are good? 

 Since in ""crane"", R was at position 2 and E at position 5? Both were wrong? So now we move R to position 1 and E to position 4? That covers new positions? 

 So I think ""ROLES"" is a reasonable choice? 

 Another candidate: ""FORCE"" -> but contains C? We know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C? 

 So eliminate ""FORCE"".

 How about ""BRINE""? But N is not allowed? Because N was not in the word? 

 Similarly: no N.

 Therefore, I stick with ""ROLES"". 

 After due consideration: guess ""ROLES"".

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,exert,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
 - The letters are all distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x -> not in the secret word
 R: - -> in the word but wrong position
 A: x -> not in the secret word
 N: x -> not in the secret word
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

 Since ""crane"" had R in the second position and E in the fifth, and both are present but in the wrong positions, R cannot be in position 2 and E cannot be in position 5.

 We must now choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Excludes C, A, N (since they are not in the word)
   - Includes R and E (but R not in position 2, and E not in position 5)
   - We can also include other letters to test.

 Let's think of words that have R and E and avoid C, A, N.

 Also, note: the word must have exactly 5 letters.

 Considering common words, let's try to use the letters we know (R, E) and also test other common letters.

 Since R and E are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions.

 Possibilities for R: cannot be at position 2. So it can be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Possibilities for E: cannot be at position 5. So it can be at 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 One idea: since R is in the word and not at position 2, try putting it at the beginning? 
 But note: we don't know if the word has R at position 1 or elsewhere.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R and E in different positions and introduces new common letters.

 We should avoid letters that we haven't tested and also avoid C, A, N.

 Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We can test other vowels: O, I, U? We know A is out so the vowel must be one of the others.

 Example: Let's try the word ""ROUTE""?
   - R at position 1 -> okay because R not at 2? But note: we don't know if position 1 is correct for R, but the feedback only said R is present and in the wrong position in position 2. Wait: our feedback was for R in position 2? In ""crane"", R was in position 2. Therefore, R might be acceptable at position 1? 
   However, the feedback indicates that R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R at position 1, that might be the correct position? Or it might not? We can try.

 But note: we have E in the word, we haven't tested T or O? 

 However, let's check: we must also avoid A, C, N. ""ROUTE"" doesn't have any of these.

 But wait: what about the feedback for E? E was in position 5 in ""crane"" and now we are putting it in position 4? 

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that has R and E and tests more new letters.

 Another common approach is to try to use letters that are frequently in five-letter words.

 Suggested word: ""ROGUE""?
   - R in position 1: if that is correct, we get a ✓, if not, we get a - for R? And we can learn about G and U? 
   But note: we should also test consonants.

 Another idea: ""RESET"" - but note that E appears twice? We don't know if the word has repeated letters? The rules don't prohibit repeated letters? But in the feedback we received, we didn't see any duplicate? So it's safer to avoid duplicates unless necessary? 

 However, let me check: we don't know if the word has repeated letters. But ""reset"" has two E's. And also we are introducing S and T.

 But note: our feedback didn't show any repeated letters? We don't know. So let me avoid repeated letters for now.

 Let's think of words that have R, E, and three new letters.

 Word: ""ROLES"" -> R, O, L, E, S -> no duplicate? 
   R at 1: we'll see if R is at position 1.
   E at position 4? But remember, E cannot be at position 5? We don't know if position 4 is acceptable because the only constraint is that position 5 was wrong? So E could be at 4? 
   This word avoids A, C, N.

 However, we are not yet sure whether O, L, or S are in the word? 

 But note: we have E in the word and we are testing O, L, S.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that places R in a position we haven't tried? In ""crane"", R was at position 2. Now we can try position 1, 3, 4, etc.

 Another common word: ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> has R and E? 
   Positions: 
     R is at position 4 -> we are testing if R is at 4? 
     E is at position 5 -> but wait! Feedback on E in ""crane"" said that E is in the word but not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5 again? That would be redundant and against the rule? 
   Therefore, we must avoid E at position 5.

 So ""STORE"" has E at position 5 -> invalid because we know that E is not at position 5? Actually, we know E is in the word and not at position 5? So putting E at position 5 in a new guess would be a waste? 

 Therefore, avoid E at position 5.

 Alternatively: ""ROLES"": E is at position 4? That's okay? 

 Or ""RESIN"": E at position 2? and R at 1? 
   ""resin"": R at 1, E at 2 -> but note: E is not forbidden at position 2? We don't know? 
   However, we know E is in the word and we haven't tried E at position 2? 

 But wait: we have R at position 1? We can try that? 

 Let me choose ""RESIN"": 
   R at 1 -> we don't know if that's the correct position? 
   E at 2 -> and E was previously at 5? So if E is at 2, we might get a ✓ or a -? 
   S at 3, I at 4, N at 5? But N is already eliminated! We cannot use N because it was in ""crane"" and we were told it's not in the word? 

 So ""RESIN"" has N -> bad, because we know N is not in the word? 

 Similarly, we must avoid A, C, N.

 Therefore, we cannot use N? 

 Then what about ""RESIT""? No N? 
   RESIT: R (1), E (2), S (3), I (4), T (5). 
   Avoids A, C, N.

 But note: we are introducing S, I, T? And E at position 2? 

 We haven't tested S, I, T? 

 Alternatively: ""ROUSE"": 
   R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E at position 5? Avoid E at position 5? 
   Therefore, we cannot use E at 5? 

 How about ""ROUGE"": 
   R(1), O(2), U(3), G(4), E(5) -> again E at 5? 

 How about switching the positions? 
 Can we move E? 

 Example: ""URBIS""? But that's not common? 

 Alternatively: ""PERIL"" -> 
   P(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), L(5)
   - This word has E at position 2 and R at position 3? 
   - Avoids A, C, N? 
   - We introduce P, I, L? 

 This seems good.

 Or ""MERIT"": 
   M(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), T(5)
   E at 2 and R at 3? 

 Also good.

 But note: both E and R are being placed at new positions? 

 However, we don't know if E can be at position 2? Let me recall: in the previous word, E was at position 5 and we were told it is in the wrong position? So E might be at position 2? 

 Similarly, R was at position 2 and now we are moving it? 

 Let me choose ""MERIT"". It has M, E, R, I, T. 
   - Introduces M, I, T? 
   - We know E and R are in the word? 

 So we can learn about M, I, T? 

 Let's see: 
   If we guess ""MERIT"", 
     if M is not in the word, we'll get an x for M? 
     E at position 2: if the word has E at position 2, then ✓, otherwise -?
     R at position 3: we know R is in the word, but was previously at position 2? So if at position 3 is correct, we get ✓? 
     Similarly, I and T? 

 This seems like a reasonable guess? 

 Another candidate: ""PERIL"" -> similar? 

 But note: we haven't tested many letters? 

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters? 

 After removing A, C, N, common letters: E, R, S, T, L, I, O? 

 Why not try a word that has S, T, or L? 

 For example: ""ROLES"" (if we can avoid E at 5? But we can put E at 4? Oh, but ""roles"" has E at position 5? Wait: 
   - R O L E S -> that's the spelling? No: R O L E S -> positions: 
        R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5? 
   Then E is at position 4? Which is acceptable? 

 Yes! So ""ROLES"" has:
   R at 1: testing if R is at 1? 
   O at 2: new letter?
   L at 3: new letter?
   E at 4: testing E at a new position? 
   S at 5: new letter?

 And avoids A, C, N.

 This tests R and E in new positions? 

 We can get information on O, L, S? 

 Compared to ""MERIT"", both are good? But ""roles"" introduces three new letters? So maybe more information? 

 Since we have only 5 more tries? We want as much information as possible? 

 Therefore, let me choose ""ROLES"" for the second guess? 

 Now, let me write ""ROLES"" and expect feedback? 

 We are done? 

 But note: the response format must be: <guess>word</guess>

 So my next guess is ""roles"".

 Let me confirm the spelling: R O L E S -> yes, it's a word meaning parts?

 Therefore, I choose ""roles"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- **C, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked with `x`).  
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked with `-`).  
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked with `-`).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include **R** and **E**, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.  
- Must exclude C, A, N.  
- Should test common letters not yet tried (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to gather new information.  

The word **""ROLES""** fits well:  
- Places R at position 1 (new position, testing if correct).  
- Places E at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).  
- Introduces three new letters: **O**, **L**, and **S**.  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N) and repeated letters.  

This guess maximizes information by testing R and E in new positions while probing new consonants and vowels.

 However, note that the feedback doesn't forbid R from being in position 2 if it's not actually the correct position? We know R is in the word but not in position 2? So we can try R in other positions? And E in other positions?

 Let's think of words that include R and E and avoid C, A, N.

 Example: ""ROLES"" (as I thought earlier) but note that in a previous interaction, I tried ""word"" and it was invalid? So let me be careful with the word choice? Actually the system said ""Model answer is not five letters"" for ""word""? So we must guess a real five-letter word? 

 How about ""ROLES""? It is a five-letter word? 
   R O L E S -> 5 letters? 

 But wait: in the second guess, I wrote ""word"" which is 4 letters? So that was invalid? Therefore, now we must make a valid guess? 

 Let's choose ""ROLES"". Steps:

   R at position 1: testing if R is at 1? (since it wasn't at 2)
   O at position 2: new letter?
   L at position 3: new letter?
   E at position 4: testing E? (previously at 5, so now at 4? Might be correct? Or at least, if it's in the word but not at 5? Maybe 4 is good?
   S at position 5: new letter?

 This will give us information about O, L, S? 

 Alternatively, we can choose ""STORE""? 
   But ""STORE"": 
      S at1, T at2, O at3, R at4, E at5? -> but E at position 5? That is the same position as before? And we were told E is not at position 5? So putting E at position 5 again would be pointless? 

 Actually, the feedback said E is present but not at position 5? So we shouldn't put E at position 5 again? 

 Therefore, avoid E at position 5? 

 Other possibilities: ""REBEL"" -> but E repeated? And B? 
   Wait: repeated E? We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters? But to avoid complication, let's try without repetitions? 

 Another word: ""PERIL"" -> 
   P E R I L? 
      E at position 2: which we haven't tried? 

 Let me compare:

   ""ROLES"": tests positions: R(1), E(4)
   ""PERIL"": tests positions: E(2), R(3) 

 Both are good? 

 Since in ""crane"", R was at position 2 and E at position 5? Both were wrong? So now we move R to position 1 and E to position 4? That covers new positions? 

 So I think ""ROLES"" is a reasonable choice? 

 Another candidate: ""FORCE"" -> but contains C? We know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C? 

 So eliminate ""FORCE"".

 How about ""BRINE""? But N is not allowed? Because N was not in the word? 

 Similarly: no N.

 Therefore, I stick with ""ROLES"". 

 After due consideration: guess ""ROLES"".

<guess>roles</guess>Based on the consistent feedback from two previous guesses of ""crane"":  
- **C, A, N** are **not** in the secret word.  
- **R** is present but **not in position 2**.  
- **E** is present but **not in position 5**.  

The next guess must:  
1. Include **R** and **E** (avoiding positions 2 and 5 respectively).  
2. Exclude C, A, N.  
3. Test new letters to gather more information.  

**""ROLES""** is a strong choice because:  
- Positions R at **1** (testing a new location for R).  
- Positions E at **4** (avoiding position 5 and testing a new spot).  
- Introduces three new common letters: **O, L, S** (probing for additional consonants/vowels).  
- Uses distinct letters, avoiding duplicates.  

This guess maximizes coverage of untested letters and efficiently checks potential positions for R and E.

But note: we don\'t know if position 1 is correct for R, but the feedback only said R is present and in the wrong position in position 2. Wait: our feedback was for R in position 2? In ""crane"", R was in position 2. Therefore, R might be acceptable at position 1? \n   However, the feedback indicates that R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R at position 1, that might be the correct position? Or it might not? We can try.\n\n But note: we have E in the word, we haven\'t tested T or O? \n\n However, let\'s check: we must also avoid A, C, N. ""ROUTE"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n But wait: what about the feedback for E? E was in position 5 in ""crane"" and now we are putting it in position 4? \n\n Alternatively, we might choose a word that has R and E and tests more new letters.\n\n Another common approach is to try to use letters that are frequently in five-letter words.\n\n Suggested word: ""ROGUE""?\n   - R in position 1: if that is correct, we get a ✓, if not, we get a - for R? And we can learn about G and U? \n   But note: we should also test consonants.\n\n Another idea: ""RESET"" - but note that E appears twice? We don\'t know if the word has repeated letters? The rules don\'t prohibit repeated letters? But in the feedback we received, we didn\'t see any duplicate? So it\'s safer to avoid duplicates unless necessary? \n\n However, let me check: we don\'t know if the word has repeated letters. But ""reset"" has two E\'s. And also we are introducing S and T.\n\n But note: our feedback didn\'t show any repeated letters? We don\'t know. So let me avoid repeated letters for now.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have R, E, and three new letters.\n\n Word: ""ROLES"" -> R, O, L, E, S -> no duplicate? \n   R at 1: we\'ll see if R is at position 1.\n   E at position 4? But remember, E cannot be at position 5? We don\'t know if position 4 is acceptable because the only constraint is that position 5 was wrong? So E could be at 4? \n   This word avoids A, C, N.\n\n However, we are not yet sure whether O, L, or S are in the word? \n\n But note: we have E in the word and we are testing O, L, S.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that places R in a position we haven\'t tried? In ""crane"", R was at position 2. Now we can try position 1, 3, 4, etc.\n\n Another common word: ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> has R and E? \n   Positions: \n     R is at position 4 -> we are testing if R is at 4? \n     E is at position 5 -> but wait! Feedback on E in ""crane"" said that E is in the word but not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5 again? That would be redundant and against the rule? \n   Therefore, we must avoid E at position 5.\n\n So ""STORE"" has E at position 5 -> invalid because we know that E is not at position 5? Actually, we know E is in the word and not at position 5? So putting E at position 5 in a new guess would be a waste? \n\n Therefore, avoid E at position 5.\n\n Alternatively: ""ROLES"": E is at position 4? That\'s okay? \n\n Or ""RESIN"": E at position 2? and R at 1? \n   ""resin"": R at 1, E at 2 -> but note: E is not forbidden at position 2? We don\'t know? \n   However, we know E is in the word and we haven\'t tried E at position 2? \n\n But wait: we have R at position 1? We can try that? \n\n Let me choose ""RESIN"": \n   R at 1 -> we don\'t know if that\'s the correct position? \n   E at 2 -> and E was previously at 5? So if E is at 2, we might get a ✓ or a -? \n   S at 3, I at 4, N at 5? But N is already eliminated! We cannot use N because it was in ""crane"" and we were told it\'s not in the word? \n\n So ""RESIN"" has N -> bad, because we know N is not in the word? \n\n Similarly, we must avoid A, C, N.\n\n Therefore, we cannot use N? \n\n Then what about ""RESIT""? No N? \n   RESIT: R (1), E (2), S (3), I (4), T (5). \n   Avoids A, C, N.\n\n But note: we are introducing S, I, T? And E at position 2? \n\n We haven\'t tested S, I, T? \n\n Alternatively: ""ROUSE"": \n   R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E at position 5? Avoid E at position 5? \n   Therefore, we cannot use E at 5? \n\n How about ""ROUGE"": \n   R(1), O(2), U(3), G(4), E(5) -> again E at 5? \n\n How about switching the positions? \n Can we move E? \n\n Example: ""URBIS""? But that\'s not common? \n\n Alternatively: ""PERIL"" -> \n   P(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), L(5)\n   - This word has E at position 2 and R at position 3? \n   - Avoids A, C, N? \n   - We introduce P, I, L? \n\n This seems good.\n\n Or ""MERIT"": \n   M(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), T(5)\n   E at 2 and R at 3? \n\n Also good.\n\n But note: both E and R are being placed at new positions? \n\n However, we don\'t know if E can be at position 2? Let me recall: in the previous word, E was at position 5 and we were told it is in the wrong position? So E might be at position 2? \n\n Similarly, R was at position 2 and now we are moving it? \n\n Let me choose ""MERIT"". It has M, E, R, I, T. \n   - Introduces M, I, T? \n   - We know E and R are in the word? \n\n So we can learn about M, I, T? \n\n Let\'s see: \n   If we guess ""MERIT"", \n     if M is not in the word, we\'ll get an x for M? \n     E at position 2: if the word has E at position 2, then ✓, otherwise -?\n     R at position 3: we know R is in the word, but was previously at position 2? So if at position 3 is correct, we get ✓? \n     Similarly, I and T? \n\n This seems like a reasonable guess? \n\n Another candidate: ""PERIL"" -> similar? \n\n But note: we haven\'t tested many letters? \n\n Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters? \n\n After removing A, C, N, common letters: E, R, S, T, L, I, O? \n\n Why not try a word that has S, T, or L? \n\n For example: ""ROLES"" (if we can avoid E at 5? But we can put E at 4? Oh, but ""roles"" has E at position 5? Wait: \n   - R O L E S -> that\'s the spelling? No: R O L E S -> positions: \n        R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5? \n   Then E is at position 4? Which is acceptable? \n\n Yes! So ""ROLES"" has:\n   R at 1: testing if R is at 1? \n   O at 2: new letter?\n   L at 3: new letter?\n   E at 4: testing E at a new position? \n   S at 5: new letter?\n\n And avoids A, C, N.\n\n This tests R and E in new positions? \n\n We can get information on O, L, S? \n\n Compared to ""MERIT"", both are good? But ""roles"" introduces three new letters? So maybe more information? \n\n Since we have only 5 more tries? We want as much information as possible? \n\n Therefore, let me choose ""ROLES"" for the second guess? \n\n Now, let me write ""ROLES"" and expect feedback? \n\n We are done? \n\n But note: the response format must be: <guess>word</guess>\n\n So my next guess is ""roles"".\n\n Let me confirm the spelling: R O L E S -> yes, it\'s a word meaning parts?\n\n Therefore, I choose ""roles"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": \n- **C, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked with `x`).  \n- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked with `-`).  \n- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked with `-`).  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Must include **R** and **E**, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.  \n- Must exclude C, A, N.  \n- Should test common letters not yet tried (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to gather new information.  \n\nThe word **""ROLES""** fits well:  \n- Places R at position 1 (new position, testing if correct).  \n- Places E at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).  \n- Introduces three new letters: **O**, **L**, and **S**.  \n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N) and repeated letters.  \n\nThis guess maximizes information by testing R and E in new positions while probing new consonants and vowels.\n\n<guess>word</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are at the beginning of the game.

We are given feedback for four guesses. Let's compile the information.
From Guess 1 and Guess 3 (both ""crane""):
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, not at position 2)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, not at position 5)

From Guess 4 (""roles""):
  R: - (in word, but not at position 1? Because we placed it at position 1 and got '-')
  O: x (not in word)
  L: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, but not at position 4? Because we placed E at position 4)
  S: x (not in word)

So now we know:
- The word contains R and E (confirmed by two guesses).
- R is not in position 2 (from ""crane"") and not in position 1 (from ""roles"").
- E is not in position 5 (from ""crane"") and not in position 4 (from ""roles"").
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, O, L, S.

Also, note that we have eliminated these letters: C, A, N, O, L, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We know the word must have R and E, and three other letters from the available set.

We also have positional constraints:
  R cannot be at position 1 or 2? 
    - From ""crane"" (position 2) and ""roles"" (position 1) -> so R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5? 
  E cannot be at position 5 or 4? 
    - From ""crane"" (position 5) and ""roles"" (position 4) -> so E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3? 

But note: we haven't tested E at positions 1, 2, or 3? Similarly R at 3,4,5? 

So we need to form a 5-letter word that includes R and E, avoids the eliminated letters, and places R in one of 3,4,5 and E in one of 1,2,3.

Additional: We have two other positions to fill? 

Common words? We can try to include more frequent letters to get information? For example: T, I, M, D, G? 

Example: Can we put R at position 3? Then we need E at one of 1,2? And we need a word with two other letters? 

Possible words:

- If E at position 1: then the word starts with E.
  Then R at position 3? 
  Example: E _ R _ _ 
  We need letters for positions 2, 4, 5? And the word must avoid eliminated letters.

  Examples:
    ""EERIE"" -> repeated E? and R at 3? But eliminated? And we don't know if the word has duplicates? But let's avoid duplicates? 
    ""EGRET"" -> but G and T? Also, E at 1 and then? But note: E is only in the word once? Actually double E? Avoid? 
    How about ""EMPTY"" -> but we need R? That doesn't work? 
    ""EHRES"" -> not English? 

Actually, hard to think? 

Alternatively: E at position 2? Then R at position 3? 
  Then the word pattern: _ E R _ _

We have positions 1, 4, 5 to fill? And must include R? 

Examples: 
  ""BERET"" -> B, E, R, E, T? Repeated E? 
  ""MERIT"" -> but eliminated? We know O,L,S are eliminated? But M, E, R, I, T? 
    But M, I, T are not eliminated? 
    ""MERIT"": M at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, T at5? 
    This word: 
      - Places E at position 2? 
      - Places R at position 3? 
      - Introduces M, I, T? 
      - Avoids C, A, N, O, L, S? 
    This seems good! 

But wait: we don't know if E can be at position 2? We haven't tested it? 

Similarly, how about R at position 4? Then E at position 2? 
  Pattern: _ E _ R _ 
  Example: ""FERRY"" -> but eliminated (O,L,S) not in it? But two R? Also, E at position 2? 
  Or ""PERKY"": P, E, R, K, Y? But E at2, R at3? Wait: 
    Pattern: P at1, E at2, R at3, K at4, Y at5? 
    But that places R at position 3? 

Alternatively, let's focus on ""MERIT"":
  Pattern: M E R I T

This way we test:
  M (new) in position 1? 
  E in position 2 (which we haven't tried before)? 
  R in position 3 (which we haven't tried before)? 
  I in position 4? 
  T in position 5? 

If E is in the word and the position 2 is correct, we get a ✓ for E? 
If R is in position 3, we get a ✓ for R? 
Otherwise, if E is not at position2? Then we get a '-' (because we know E is in the word) but that tells us E is elsewhere? Similarly for R? 

Also, M, I, T might be present? 

So we can get good information? 

Another candidate: ""TRIED"" 
  T R I E D? 
    T at1, R at2? But wait: R cannot be at position 2? Because from ""crane"" we got that R is not at position 2? So that's invalid? 
  Actually, pattern: T(1), R(2) -> but R cannot be at position 2? So skip.

How about ""TRIBE"": 
  T R I B E? But R at position 2? Invalid? 

How about ""TERRA"" -> repeated R? and A? Eliminated? 

After consideration, ""MERIT"" seems a strong candidate? 

But note: we can also try ""BRIDE""? 
  Pattern: B R I D E? 
    R at position 2? Again, forbidden? 

So avoid R at position 2? 

Therefore, ""MERIT"" uses positions: 
  Position1: M? 
  Position2: E? 
  Position3: R? 
  Position4: I? 
  Position5: T? 

And R at position3 and E at position2? Both new? So we test two new positions for R and E? 

Also, the word is valid: M, E, R, I, T? 

Therefore, I choose ""MERIT"" as the next guess.

<guess>merit</guess>
</think>
Based on previous feedback:

- **Known letters:** R and E are in the word but **not** in the positions tested:
  - R can't be in position 1 (from ""roles"" feedback) or 2 (from ""crane"" feedback).
  - E can't be in position 4 (from ""roles"" feedback) or 5 (from ""crane"" feedback).
- **Eliminated letters (not in word):** C, A, N, O, L, S.
- **Letters to test:** Untried common consonants/vowels (e.g., T, I, M, B, D, G).

Optimal next guess: **""MERIT""**  
- Tests **R in position 3** and **E in position 2** (both new positions).  
- Introduces three new letters: **M (1)**, **I (4)**, **T (5)**.  
- Avoids eliminated letters and position conflicts.  
- Efficiently narrows possibilities while probing critical placements for R and E.

<guess>merit</guess>",merit,"We are given feedback for four guesses. Let's compile the information.
From Guess 1 and Guess 3 (both ""crane""):
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, not at position 2)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, not at position 5)

From Guess 4 (""roles""):
  R: - (in word, but not at position 1? Because we placed it at position 1 and got '-')
  O: x (not in word)
  L: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, but not at position 4? Because we placed E at position 4)
  S: x (not in word)

So now we know:
- The word contains R and E (confirmed by two guesses).
- R is not in position 2 (from ""crane"") and not in position 1 (from ""roles"").
- E is not in position 5 (from ""crane"") and not in position 4 (from ""roles"").
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, O, L, S.

Also, note that we have eliminated these letters: C, A, N, O, L, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We know the word must have R and E, and three other letters from the available set.

We also have positional constraints:
  R cannot be at position 1 or 2? 
    - From ""crane"" (position 2) and ""roles"" (position 1) -> so R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5? 
  E cannot be at position 5 or 4? 
    - From ""crane"" (position 5) and ""roles"" (position 4) -> so E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3? 

But note: we haven't tested E at positions 1, 2, or 3? Similarly R at 3,4,5? 

So we need to form a 5-letter word that includes R and E, avoids the eliminated letters, and places R in one of 3,4,5 and E in one of 1,2,3.

Additional: We have two other positions to fill? 

Common words? We can try to include more frequent letters to get information? For example: T, I, M, D, G? 

Example: Can we put R at position 3? Then we need E at one of 1,2? And we need a word with two other letters? 

Possible words:

- If E at position 1: then the word starts with E.
  Then R at position 3? 
  Example: E _ R _ _ 
  We need letters for positions 2, 4, 5? And the word must avoid eliminated letters.

  Examples:
    ""EERIE"" -> repeated E? and R at 3? But eliminated? And we don't know if the word has duplicates? But let's avoid duplicates? 
    ""EGRET"" -> but G and T? Also, E at 1 and then? But note: E is only in the word once? Actually double E? Avoid? 
    How about ""EMPTY"" -> but we need R? That doesn't work? 
    ""EHRES"" -> not English? 

Actually, hard to think? 

Alternatively: E at position 2? Then R at position 3? 
  Then the word pattern: _ E R _ _

We have positions 1, 4, 5 to fill? And must include R? 

Examples: 
  ""BERET"" -> B, E, R, E, T? Repeated E? 
  ""MERIT"" -> but eliminated? We know O,L,S are eliminated? But M, E, R, I, T? 
    But M, I, T are not eliminated? 
    ""MERIT"": M at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, T at5? 
    This word: 
      - Places E at position 2? 
      - Places R at position 3? 
      - Introduces M, I, T? 
      - Avoids C, A, N, O, L, S? 
    This seems good! 

But wait: we don't know if E can be at position 2? We haven't tested it? 

Similarly, how about R at position 4? Then E at position 2? 
  Pattern: _ E _ R _ 
  Example: ""FERRY"" -> but eliminated (O,L,S) not in it? But two R? Also, E at position 2? 
  Or ""PERKY"": P, E, R, K, Y? But E at2, R at3? Wait: 
    Pattern: P at1, E at2, R at3, K at4, Y at5? 
    But that places R at position 3? 

Alternatively, let's focus on ""MERIT"":
  Pattern: M E R I T

This way we test:
  M (new) in position 1? 
  E in position 2 (which we haven't tried before)? 
  R in position 3 (which we haven't tried before)? 
  I in position 4? 
  T in position 5? 

If E is in the word and the position 2 is correct, we get a ✓ for E? 
If R is in position 3, we get a ✓ for R? 
Otherwise, if E is not at position2? Then we get a '-' (because we know E is in the word) but that tells us E is elsewhere? Similarly for R? 

Also, M, I, T might be present? 

So we can get good information? 

Another candidate: ""TRIED"" 
  T R I E D? 
    T at1, R at2? But wait: R cannot be at position 2? Because from ""crane"" we got that R is not at position 2? So that's invalid? 
  Actually, pattern: T(1), R(2) -> but R cannot be at position 2? So skip.

How about ""TRIBE"": 
  T R I B E? But R at position 2? Invalid? 

How about ""TERRA"" -> repeated R? and A? Eliminated? 

After consideration, ""MERIT"" seems a strong candidate? 

But note: we can also try ""BRIDE""? 
  Pattern: B R I D E? 
    R at position 2? Again, forbidden? 

So avoid R at position 2? 

Therefore, ""MERIT"" uses positions: 
  Position1: M? 
  Position2: E? 
  Position3: R? 
  Position4: I? 
  Position5: T? 

And R at position3 and E at position2? Both new? So we test two new positions for R and E? 

Also, the word is valid: M, E, R, I, T? 

Therefore, I choose ""MERIT"" as the next guess.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,exert,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
 - The letters are all distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x -> not in the secret word
 R: - -> in the word but wrong position
 A: x -> not in the secret word
 N: x -> not in the secret word
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

 Since ""crane"" had R in the second position and E in the fifth, and both are present but in the wrong positions, R cannot be in position 2 and E cannot be in position 5.

 We must now choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Excludes C, A, N (since they are not in the word)
   - Includes R and E (but R not in position 2, and E not in position 5)
   - We can also include other letters to test.

 Let's think of words that have R and E and avoid C, A, N.

 Also, note: the word must have exactly 5 letters.

 Considering common words, let's try to use the letters we know (R, E) and also test other common letters.

 Since R and E are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions.

 Possibilities for R: cannot be at position 2. So it can be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Possibilities for E: cannot be at position 5. So it can be at 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 One idea: since R is in the word and not at position 2, try putting it at the beginning? 
 But note: we don't know if the word has R at position 1 or elsewhere.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R and E in different positions and introduces new common letters.

 We should avoid letters that we haven't tested and also avoid C, A, N.

 Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We can test other vowels: O, I, U? We know A is out so the vowel must be one of the others.

 Example: Let's try the word ""ROUTE""?
   - R at position 1 -> okay because R not at 2? But note: we don't know if position 1 is correct for R, but the feedback only said R is present and in the wrong position in position 2. Wait: our feedback was for R in position 2? In ""crane"", R was in position 2. Therefore, R might be acceptable at position 1? 
   However, the feedback indicates that R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R at position 1, that might be the correct position? Or it might not? We can try.

 But note: we have E in the word, we haven't tested T or O? 

 However, let's check: we must also avoid A, C, N. ""ROUTE"" doesn't have any of these.

 But wait: what about the feedback for E? E was in position 5 in ""crane"" and now we are putting it in position 4? 

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that has R and E and tests more new letters.

 Another common approach is to try to use letters that are frequently in five-letter words.

 Suggested word: ""ROGUE""?
   - R in position 1: if that is correct, we get a ✓, if not, we get a - for R? And we can learn about G and U? 
   But note: we should also test consonants.

 Another idea: ""RESET"" - but note that E appears twice? We don't know if the word has repeated letters? The rules don't prohibit repeated letters? But in the feedback we received, we didn't see any duplicate? So it's safer to avoid duplicates unless necessary? 

 However, let me check: we don't know if the word has repeated letters. But ""reset"" has two E's. And also we are introducing S and T.

 But note: our feedback didn't show any repeated letters? We don't know. So let me avoid repeated letters for now.

 Let's think of words that have R, E, and three new letters.

 Word: ""ROLES"" -> R, O, L, E, S -> no duplicate? 
   R at 1: we'll see if R is at position 1.
   E at position 4? But remember, E cannot be at position 5? We don't know if position 4 is acceptable because the only constraint is that position 5 was wrong? So E could be at 4? 
   This word avoids A, C, N.

 However, we are not yet sure whether O, L, or S are in the word? 

 But note: we have E in the word and we are testing O, L, S.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that places R in a position we haven't tried? In ""crane"", R was at position 2. Now we can try position 1, 3, 4, etc.

 Another common word: ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> has R and E? 
   Positions: 
     R is at position 4 -> we are testing if R is at 4? 
     E is at position 5 -> but wait! Feedback on E in ""crane"" said that E is in the word but not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5 again? That would be redundant and against the rule? 
   Therefore, we must avoid E at position 5.

 So ""STORE"" has E at position 5 -> invalid because we know that E is not at position 5? Actually, we know E is in the word and not at position 5? So putting E at position 5 in a new guess would be a waste? 

 Therefore, avoid E at position 5.

 Alternatively: ""ROLES"": E is at position 4? That's okay? 

 Or ""RESIN"": E at position 2? and R at 1? 
   ""resin"": R at 1, E at 2 -> but note: E is not forbidden at position 2? We don't know? 
   However, we know E is in the word and we haven't tried E at position 2? 

 But wait: we have R at position 1? We can try that? 

 Let me choose ""RESIN"": 
   R at 1 -> we don't know if that's the correct position? 
   E at 2 -> and E was previously at 5? So if E is at 2, we might get a ✓ or a -? 
   S at 3, I at 4, N at 5? But N is already eliminated! We cannot use N because it was in ""crane"" and we were told it's not in the word? 

 So ""RESIN"" has N -> bad, because we know N is not in the word? 

 Similarly, we must avoid A, C, N.

 Therefore, we cannot use N? 

 Then what about ""RESIT""? No N? 
   RESIT: R (1), E (2), S (3), I (4), T (5). 
   Avoids A, C, N.

 But note: we are introducing S, I, T? And E at position 2? 

 We haven't tested S, I, T? 

 Alternatively: ""ROUSE"": 
   R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E at position 5? Avoid E at position 5? 
   Therefore, we cannot use E at 5? 

 How about ""ROUGE"": 
   R(1), O(2), U(3), G(4), E(5) -> again E at 5? 

 How about switching the positions? 
 Can we move E? 

 Example: ""URBIS""? But that's not common? 

 Alternatively: ""PERIL"" -> 
   P(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), L(5)
   - This word has E at position 2 and R at position 3? 
   - Avoids A, C, N? 
   - We introduce P, I, L? 

 This seems good.

 Or ""MERIT"": 
   M(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), T(5)
   E at 2 and R at 3? 

 Also good.

 But note: both E and R are being placed at new positions? 

 However, we don't know if E can be at position 2? Let me recall: in the previous word, E was at position 5 and we were told it is in the wrong position? So E might be at position 2? 

 Similarly, R was at position 2 and now we are moving it? 

 Let me choose ""MERIT"". It has M, E, R, I, T. 
   - Introduces M, I, T? 
   - We know E and R are in the word? 

 So we can learn about M, I, T? 

 Let's see: 
   If we guess ""MERIT"", 
     if M is not in the word, we'll get an x for M? 
     E at position 2: if the word has E at position 2, then ✓, otherwise -?
     R at position 3: we know R is in the word, but was previously at position 2? So if at position 3 is correct, we get ✓? 
     Similarly, I and T? 

 This seems like a reasonable guess? 

 Another candidate: ""PERIL"" -> similar? 

 But note: we haven't tested many letters? 

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters? 

 After removing A, C, N, common letters: E, R, S, T, L, I, O? 

 Why not try a word that has S, T, or L? 

 For example: ""ROLES"" (if we can avoid E at 5? But we can put E at 4? Oh, but ""roles"" has E at position 5? Wait: 
   - R O L E S -> that's the spelling? No: R O L E S -> positions: 
        R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5? 
   Then E is at position 4? Which is acceptable? 

 Yes! So ""ROLES"" has:
   R at 1: testing if R is at 1? 
   O at 2: new letter?
   L at 3: new letter?
   E at 4: testing E at a new position? 
   S at 5: new letter?

 And avoids A, C, N.

 This tests R and E in new positions? 

 We can get information on O, L, S? 

 Compared to ""MERIT"", both are good? But ""roles"" introduces three new letters? So maybe more information? 

 Since we have only 5 more tries? We want as much information as possible? 

 Therefore, let me choose ""ROLES"" for the second guess? 

 Now, let me write ""ROLES"" and expect feedback? 

 We are done? 

 But note: the response format must be: <guess>word</guess>

 So my next guess is ""roles"".

 Let me confirm the spelling: R O L E S -> yes, it's a word meaning parts?

 Therefore, I choose ""roles"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- **C, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked with `x`).  
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked with `-`).  
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked with `-`).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include **R** and **E**, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.  
- Must exclude C, A, N.  
- Should test common letters not yet tried (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to gather new information.  

The word **""ROLES""** fits well:  
- Places R at position 1 (new position, testing if correct).  
- Places E at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).  
- Introduces three new letters: **O**, **L**, and **S**.  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N) and repeated letters.  

This guess maximizes information by testing R and E in new positions while probing new consonants and vowels.

<guess>word</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are at the beginning of the game. We have to make our first 5-letter word guess. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters and no duplicates to maximize information. Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. 

Considering the English language, a word with common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S, T) is beneficial. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels and two common consonants, and all letters are distinct. 

Therefore, I choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

<guess>crane</guess>First guess: Thinking step by step.
- For the initial guess, choose a word that includes common letters and distinct letters to maximize information. 
- Effective starters include words with common vowels (e.g., A, E) and consonants (e.g., R, S, T).
- ""CRANE"" is optimal: it has **C, R, A, N, E** — covering three vowels and useful consonants, all unique. This tests frequent letters and positions.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two identical feedbacks for ""crane"" in Guess 1 and Guess 3. That's unusual because typically we wouldn't repeat the same guess. But ignoring that, the feedback remains the same.
 Feedback from ""crane"":
   C: not in the word (x)
   R: in the word but wrong position (-)
   A: not in the word (x)
   N: not in the word (x)
   E: in the word but wrong position (-)

 Therefore, the secret word:
   - Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively).
   - Does not contain C, A, or N.

 We must make a new guess that:
   - Is a 5-letter word.
   - Includes R and E (since they are present in the word).
   - Avoids C, A, N.
   - Places R and E in positions different from 2 and 5 respectively? Actually, for E, we know position 5 is wrong, but it could be in other positions? Similarly R cannot be only at position 2? But we haven't tried other positions.

 However, note that the feedback doesn't forbid R from being in position 2 if it's not actually the correct position? We know R is in the word but not in position 2? So we can try R in other positions? And E in other positions?

 Let's think of words that include R and E and avoid C, A, N.

 Example: ""ROLES"" (as I thought earlier) but note that in a previous interaction, I tried ""word"" and it was invalid? So let me be careful with the word choice? Actually the system said ""Model answer is not five letters"" for ""word""? So we must guess a real five-letter word? 

 How about ""ROLES""? It is a five-letter word? 
   R O L E S -> 5 letters? 

 But wait: in the second guess, I wrote ""word"" which is 4 letters? So that was invalid? Therefore, now we must make a valid guess? 

 Let's choose ""ROLES"". Steps:

   R at position 1: testing if R is at 1? (since it wasn't at 2)
   O at position 2: new letter?
   L at position 3: new letter?
   E at position 4: testing E? (previously at 5, so now at 4? Might be correct? Or at least, if it's in the word but not at 5? Maybe 4 is good?
   S at position 5: new letter?

 This will give us information about O, L, S? 

 Alternatively, we can choose ""STORE""? 
   But ""STORE"": 
      S at1, T at2, O at3, R at4, E at5? -> but E at position 5? That is the same position as before? And we were told E is not at position 5? So putting E at position 5 again would be pointless? 

 Actually, the feedback said E is present but not at position 5? So we shouldn't put E at position 5 again? 

 Therefore, avoid E at position 5? 

 Other possibilities: ""REBEL"" -> but E repeated? And B? 
   Wait: repeated E? We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters? But to avoid complication, let's try without repetitions? 

 Another word: ""PERIL"" -> 
   P E R I L? 
      E at position 2: which we haven't tried? 

 Let me compare:

   ""ROLES"": tests positions: R(1), E(4)
   ""PERIL"": tests positions: E(2), R(3) 

 Both are good? 

 Since in ""crane"", R was at position 2 and E at position 5? Both were wrong? So now we move R to position 1 and E to position 4? That covers new positions? 

 So I think ""ROLES"" is a reasonable choice? 

 Another candidate: ""FORCE"" -> but contains C? We know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C? 

 So eliminate ""FORCE"".

 How about ""BRINE""? But N is not allowed? Because N was not in the word? 

 Similarly: no N.

 Therefore, I stick with ""ROLES"". 

 After due consideration: guess ""ROLES"".

<guess>roles</guess>Based on the consistent feedback from two previous guesses of ""crane"":  
- **C, A, N** are **not** in the secret word.  
- **R** is present but **not in position 2**.  
- **E** is present but **not in position 5**.  

The next guess must:  
1. Include **R** and **E** (avoiding positions 2 and 5 respectively).  
2. Exclude C, A, N.  
3. Test new letters to gather more information.  

**""ROLES""** is a strong choice because:  
- Positions R at **1** (testing a new location for R).  
- Positions E at **4** (avoiding position 5 and testing a new spot).  
- Introduces three new common letters: **O, L, S** (probing for additional consonants/vowels).  
- Uses distinct letters, avoiding duplicates.  

This guess maximizes coverage of untested letters and efficiently checks potential positions for R and E.

<guess>roles</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 4: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(x) E(-) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for four guesses. Let's compile the information.
From Guess 1 and Guess 3 (both ""crane""):
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, not at position 2)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, not at position 5)

From Guess 4 (""roles""):
  R: - (in word, but not at position 1? Because we placed it at position 1 and got '-')
  O: x (not in word)
  L: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, but not at position 4? Because we placed E at position 4)
  S: x (not in word)

So now we know:
- The word contains R and E (confirmed by two guesses).
- R is not in position 2 (from ""crane"") and not in position 1 (from ""roles"").
- E is not in position 5 (from ""crane"") and not in position 4 (from ""roles"").
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, O, L, S.

Also, note that we have eliminated these letters: C, A, N, O, L, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We know the word must have R and E, and three other letters from the available set.

We also have positional constraints:
  R cannot be at position 1 or 2? 
    - From ""crane"" (position 2) and ""roles"" (position 1) -> so R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5? 
  E cannot be at position 5 or 4? 
    - From ""crane"" (position 5) and ""roles"" (position 4) -> so E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3? 

But note: we haven't tested E at positions 1, 2, or 3? Similarly R at 3,4,5? 

So we need to form a 5-letter word that includes R and E, avoids the eliminated letters, and places R in one of 3,4,5 and E in one of 1,2,3.

Additional: We have two other positions to fill? 

Common words? We can try to include more frequent letters to get information? For example: T, I, M, D, G? 

Example: Can we put R at position 3? Then we need E at one of 1,2? And we need a word with two other letters? 

Possible words:

- If E at position 1: then the word starts with E.
  Then R at position 3? 
  Example: E _ R _ _ 
  We need letters for positions 2, 4, 5? And the word must avoid eliminated letters.

  Examples:
    ""EERIE"" -> repeated E? and R at 3? But eliminated? And we don't know if the word has duplicates? But let's avoid duplicates? 
    ""EGRET"" -> but G and T? Also, E at 1 and then? But note: E is only in the word once? Actually double E? Avoid? 
    How about ""EMPTY"" -> but we need R? That doesn't work? 
    ""EHRES"" -> not English? 

Actually, hard to think? 

Alternatively: E at position 2? Then R at position 3? 
  Then the word pattern: _ E R _ _

We have positions 1, 4, 5 to fill? And must include R? 

Examples: 
  ""BERET"" -> B, E, R, E, T? Repeated E? 
  ""MERIT"" -> but eliminated? We know O,L,S are eliminated? But M, E, R, I, T? 
    But M, I, T are not eliminated? 
    ""MERIT"": M at1, E at2, R at3, I at4, T at5? 
    This word: 
      - Places E at position 2? 
      - Places R at position 3? 
      - Introduces M, I, T? 
      - Avoids C, A, N, O, L, S? 
    This seems good! 

But wait: we don't know if E can be at position 2? We haven't tested it? 

Similarly, how about R at position 4? Then E at position 2? 
  Pattern: _ E _ R _ 
  Example: ""FERRY"" -> but eliminated (O,L,S) not in it? But two R? Also, E at position 2? 
  Or ""PERKY"": P, E, R, K, Y? But E at2, R at3? Wait: 
    Pattern: P at1, E at2, R at3, K at4, Y at5? 
    But that places R at position 3? 

Alternatively, let's focus on ""MERIT"":
  Pattern: M E R I T

This way we test:
  M (new) in position 1? 
  E in position 2 (which we haven't tried before)? 
  R in position 3 (which we haven't tried before)? 
  I in position 4? 
  T in position 5? 

If E is in the word and the position 2 is correct, we get a ✓ for E? 
If R is in position 3, we get a ✓ for R? 
Otherwise, if E is not at position2? Then we get a '-' (because we know E is in the word) but that tells us E is elsewhere? Similarly for R? 

Also, M, I, T might be present? 

So we can get good information? 

Another candidate: ""TRIED"" 
  T R I E D? 
    T at1, R at2? But wait: R cannot be at position 2? Because from ""crane"" we got that R is not at position 2? So that's invalid? 
  Actually, pattern: T(1), R(2) -> but R cannot be at position 2? So skip.

How about ""TRIBE"": 
  T R I B E? But R at position 2? Invalid? 

How about ""TERRA"" -> repeated R? and A? Eliminated? 

After consideration, ""MERIT"" seems a strong candidate? 

But note: we can also try ""BRIDE""? 
  Pattern: B R I D E? 
    R at position 2? Again, forbidden? 

So avoid R at position 2? 

Therefore, ""MERIT"" uses positions: 
  Position1: M? 
  Position2: E? 
  Position3: R? 
  Position4: I? 
  Position5: T? 

And R at position3 and E at position2? Both new? So we test two new positions for R and E? 

Also, the word is valid: M, E, R, I, T? 

Therefore, I choose ""MERIT"" as the next guess.

<guess>merit</guess>Based on previous feedback:

- **Known letters:** R and E are in the word but **not** in the positions tested:
  - R can't be in position 1 (from ""roles"" feedback) or 2 (from ""crane"" feedback).
  - E can't be in position 4 (from ""roles"" feedback) or 5 (from ""crane"" feedback).
- **Eliminated letters (not in word):** C, A, N, O, L, S.
- **Letters to test:** Untried common consonants/vowels (e.g., T, I, M, B, D, G).

Optimal next guess: **""MERIT""**  
- Tests **R in position 3** and **E in position 2** (both new positions).  
- Introduces three new letters: **M (1)**, **I (4)**, **T (5)**.  
- Avoids eliminated letters and position conflicts.  
- Efficiently narrows possibilities while probing critical placements for R and E.

We can try.\n\n But note: we have E in the word, we haven\'t tested T or O? \n\n However, let\'s check: we must also avoid A, C, N. ""ROUTE"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n But wait: what about the feedback for E? E was in position 5 in ""crane"" and now we are putting it in position 4? \n\n Alternatively, we might choose a word that has R and E and tests more new letters.\n\n Another common approach is to try to use letters that are frequently in five-letter words.\n\n Suggested word: ""ROGUE""?\n   - R in position 1: if that is correct, we get a ✓, if not, we get a - for R? And we can learn about G and U? \n   But note: we should also test consonants.\n\n Another idea: ""RESET"" - but note that E appears twice? We don\'t know if the word has repeated letters? The rules don\'t prohibit repeated letters? But in the feedback we received, we didn\'t see any duplicate? So it\'s safer to avoid duplicates unless necessary? \n\n However, let me check: we don\'t know if the word has repeated letters. But ""reset"" has two E\'s. And also we are introducing S and T.\n\n But note: our feedback didn\'t show any repeated letters? We don\'t know. So let me avoid repeated letters for now.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have R, E, and three new letters.\n\n Word: ""ROLES"" -> R, O, L, E, S -> no duplicate? \n   R at 1: we\'ll see if R is at position 1.\n   E at position 4? But remember, E cannot be at position 5? We don\'t know if position 4 is acceptable because the only constraint is that position 5 was wrong? So E could be at 4? \n   This word avoids A, C, N.\n\n However, we are not yet sure whether O, L, or S are in the word? \n\n But note: we have E in the word and we are testing O, L, S.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that places R in a position we haven\'t tried? In ""crane"", R was at position 2. Now we can try position 1, 3, 4, etc.\n\n Another common word: ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> has R and E? \n   Positions: \n     R is at position 4 -> we are testing if R is at 4? \n     E is at position 5 -> but wait! Feedback on E in ""crane"" said that E is in the word but not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5 again? That would be redundant and against the rule? \n   Therefore, we must avoid E at position 5.\n\n So ""STORE"" has E at position 5 -> invalid because we know that E is not at position 5? Actually, we know E is in the word and not at position 5? So putting E at position 5 in a new guess would be a waste? \n\n Therefore, avoid E at position 5.\n\n Alternatively: ""ROLES"": E is at position 4? That\'s okay? \n\n Or ""RESIN"": E at position 2? and R at 1? \n   ""resin"": R at 1, E at 2 -> but note: E is not forbidden at position 2? We don\'t know? \n   However, we know E is in the word and we haven\'t tried E at position 2? \n\n But wait: we have R at position 1? We can try that? \n\n Let me choose ""RESIN"": \n   R at 1 -> we don\'t know if that\'s the correct position? \n   E at 2 -> and E was previously at 5? So if E is at 2, we might get a ✓ or a -? \n   S at 3, I at 4, N at 5? But N is already eliminated! We cannot use N because it was in ""crane"" and we were told it\'s not in the word? \n\n So ""RESIN"" has N -> bad, because we know N is not in the word? \n\n Similarly, we must avoid A, C, N.\n\n Therefore, we cannot use N? \n\n Then what about ""RESIT""? No N? \n   RESIT: R (1), E (2), S (3), I (4), T (5). \n   Avoids A, C, N.\n\n But note: we are introducing S, I, T? And E at position 2? \n\n We haven\'t tested S, I, T? \n\n Alternatively: ""ROUSE"": \n   R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E at position 5? Avoid E at position 5? \n   Therefore, we cannot use E at 5? \n\n How about ""ROUGE"": \n   R(1), O(2), U(3), G(4), E(5) -> again E at 5? \n\n How about switching the positions? \n Can we move E? \n\n Example: ""URBIS""? But that\'s not common? \n\n Alternatively: ""PERIL"" -> \n   P(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), L(5)\n   - This word has E at position 2 and R at position 3? \n   - Avoids A, C, N? \n   - We introduce P, I, L? \n\n This seems good.\n\n Or ""MERIT"": \n   M(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), T(5)\n   E at 2 and R at 3? \n\n Also good.\n\n But note: both E and R are being placed at new positions? \n\n However, we don\'t know if E can be at position 2? Let me recall: in the previous word, E was at position 5 and we were told it is in the wrong position? So E might be at position 2? \n\n Similarly, R was at position 2 and now we are moving it? \n\n Let me choose ""MERIT"". It has M, E, R, I, T. \n   - Introduces M, I, T? \n   - We know E and R are in the word? \n\n So we can learn about M, I, T? \n\n Let\'s see: \n   If we guess ""MERIT"", \n     if M is not in the word, we\'ll get an x for M? \n     E at position 2: if the word has E at position 2, then ✓, otherwise -?\n     R at position 3: we know R is in the word, but was previously at position 2? So if at position 3 is correct, we get ✓? \n     Similarly, I and T? \n\n This seems like a reasonable guess? \n\n Another candidate: ""PERIL"" -> similar? \n\n But note: we haven\'t tested many letters? \n\n Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters? \n\n After removing A, C, N, common letters: E, R, S, T, L, I, O? \n\n Why not try a word that has S, T, or L? \n\n For example: ""ROLES"" (if we can avoid E at 5? But we can put E at 4? Oh, but ""roles"" has E at position 5? Wait: \n   - R O L E S -> that\'s the spelling? No: R O L E S -> positions: \n        R at 1, O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5? \n   Then E is at position 4? Which is acceptable? \n\n Yes! So ""ROLES"" has:\n   R at 1: testing if R is at 1? \n   O at 2: new letter?\n   L at 3: new letter?\n   E at 4: testing E at a new position? \n   S at 5: new letter?\n\n And avoids A, C, N.\n\n This tests R and E in new positions? \n\n We can get information on O, L, S? \n\n Compared to ""MERIT"", both are good? But ""roles"" introduces three new letters? So maybe more information? \n\n Since we have only 5 more tries? We want as much information as possible? \n\n Therefore, let me choose ""ROLES"" for the second guess? \n\n Now, let me write ""ROLES"" and expect feedback? \n\n We are done? \n\n But note: the response format must be: <guess>word</guess>\n\n So my next guess is ""roles"".\n\n Let me confirm the spelling: R O L E S -> yes, it\'s a word meaning parts?\n\n Therefore, I choose ""roles"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": \n- **C, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked with `x`).  \n- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked with `-`).  \n- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked with `-`).  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Must include **R** and **E**, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.  \n- Must exclude C, A, N.  \n- Should test common letters not yet tried (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to gather new information.  \n\nThe word **""ROLES""** fits well:  \n- Places R at position 1 (new position, testing if correct).  \n- Places E at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).  \n- Introduces three new letters: **O**, **L**, and **S**.  \n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N) and repeated letters.  \n\nThis guess maximizes information by testing R and E in new positions while probing new consonants and vowels.\n\n<guess>word</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are at the beginning of the game.

Both were wrong? So now we move R to position 1 and E to position 4? That covers new positions? \n\n So I think ""ROLES"" is a reasonable choice? \n\n Another candidate: ""FORCE"" -> but contains C? We know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C? \n\n So eliminate ""FORCE"".\n\n How about ""BRINE""? But N is not allowed? Because N was not in the word? \n\n Similarly: no N.\n\n Therefore, I stick with ""ROLES"". \n\n After due consideration: guess ""ROLES"".\n\n<guess>roles</guess>Based on the consistent feedback from two previous guesses of ""crane"":  \n- **C, A, N** are **not** in the secret word.  \n- **R** is present but **not in position 2**.  \n- **E** is present but **not in position 5**.  \n\nThe next guess must:  \n1. Include **R** and **E** (avoiding positions 2 and 5 respectively).  \n2. Exclude C, A, N.  \n3. Test new letters to gather more information.  \n\n**""ROLES""** is a strong choice because:  \n- Positions R at **1** (testing a new location for R).  \n- Positions E at **4** (avoiding position 5 and testing a new spot).  \n- Introduces three new common letters: **O, L, S** (probing for additional consonants/vowels).  \n- Uses distinct letters, avoiding duplicates.  \n\nThis guess maximizes coverage of untested letters and efficiently checks potential positions for R and E.\n\n<guess>roles</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\nGuess 3: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 4: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(x) E(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for four guesses.

We are given feedback for the fifth guess ""merit"":
- M: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- I: x (not in the word)
- T: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5)

From previous feedback, we also know:
- The word contains R and E (confirmed by multiple guesses).
- R has been tried at positions 2 (crane), 1 (roles), and 3 (merit) — all wrong. So R must be in position 4? (since positions 1,2,3 are eliminated and we only have 5 positions).
- E has been tried at positions 5 (crane), 4 (roles), and 2 (merit) — all wrong. So E must be in position 1 or 3? (positions 1 and 3 are untested).

Also, eliminated letters: C, A, N, O, L, S, M, I (from all previous feedback).

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We know T is in the word and is at position 5. So the word ends with T.

Therefore, the secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ T

Constraints:
- R must be in position 4? (since positions 1,2,3 are already tested and wrong). We have not tried R at position 4 or maybe position 5? But position 5 is T? So R must be at 4? 
  - Because R cannot be at 1 (from roles), 2 (crane), 3 (merit). Therefore, only position 4 left? 
  - So we can fix R at position 4? 
- E must be in the word but not at 2 (merit), 4 (roles), or 5 (crane). And since position 4 is R? Then E must be at position 1 or 3? 

So the pattern possibilities:
Position 1: must be E? Or another letter? But E has to be in one of the remaining positions? 
Position 3: could be E? Or position 1?
Position 2: unknown letter? But not E? 

Therefore, possible word structures:
Option 1: E ? ? R T
Option 2: ? E ? R T   -> but E at position 2 has been tested and we know it's wrong? So that option is not allowed? Because from merit: E(-) at position 2? Meaning the word has E but not at 2? 
Option 3: ? ? E R T

Therefore, patterns are:
Pattern A: E ? ? R T
Pattern B: ? ? E R T   (with E at position 3)

We must fill the middle positions with available letters? But note: pattern A has position 2 and 3 to fill? Pattern B has position 1 and 2 to fill? And both must include only available letters? 

We also have two other letters to determine? 

Let's think about words ending with ""RT"" and having E? 

Pattern A: E _ _ R T? That would be E? ? R T? So four letters? Wait: position 1: E, position 2: unknown, position 3: unknown, position 4: R, position 5: T. 

Pattern B: similarly: position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: E, position 4: R, position 5: T.

We must find a valid English word? 

Pattern A: E _ _ R T? Is this possible? 
   Examples: 
     EERIE? But has duplicate E? And R at 4? But E at 1? But EERIE: E E R I E? Positions: E(1), E(2), R(3)? Wait no? 
     We need two middle letters? 

   How about: 
     ""EIDER"": E I D E R? But that doesn't fit _ _ _ R T? Because the last letter is R? Not T? 
     ""EGRET"": but eliminated? We know O and S? Also, T at end? But E G R E T? Pattern: E(1), G(2), R(3), E(4), T(5)? But that places R at 3? But R must be at 4? 

   Actually, pattern A fixes R at position 4? So the word must be four letters? Wait: five: 
     1: E, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: T.

   So the string at positions 3 and 4: ? R? Then the last is T? 

   Words:  ... R T? 

   Common words: 
      ""alert"" -> but eliminated? L? 
      ""exert"": E X E R T? 
        Positions: E(1), X(2), E(3), R(4), T(5)? 
        This fits pattern A: E ? ? R T? The middle positions: X at2, E at3? 
        Also, E is at position3? But we are allowed E? However, we have E at two positions? 

        But note: we know the word must have E? And we are testing E at position 1? But in ""exert"": E is at position1 and position3? 

        Also, the eliminated letters: 
          C, A, N, O, L, S, M, I? 
          X and E are available? 

        So ""exert"" is a candidate? 

Pattern B: ? ? E R T? 
   Examples: 
     ""PERT"": only 4 letters? 
     ""INERT"": but I and N eliminated? 
     ""ALERT"": eliminated? 
     ""OVERT"": O eliminated? 

     How about: 
        ""UPSET"": but S is eliminated? 
        ""EVERY"": doesn't end with T? 
        ""BERTH"": doesn't end with T? 
        Other words ending in ""ERT""? 
          ""PERT"" -> not 5? 
          ""EXPERT"": 5? But E X P E R T? 
          ""insert"": S? 
          ""DESERT"": D E S E R T? S eliminated? 

     Consider ""expert"": but that is 6 letters? 
     No: expert is 6? 

     How about ""BERTH""? No: ends with H? 

     ""INERT"" is eliminated? 

     Another: ""PREFIX""? Too long? 

     So pattern B seems harder? 

Therefore, let's focus on pattern A: E _ _ R T? 

But note: the word ""exert"" fits: 
   E(1), X(2), E(3), R(4), T(5)

But we need to check the feedback: 
   We know E is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? 
   Also, in ""exert"", E is at position 1 and 3? 
   But the constraint: E must be present? But it might be twice? 

However, we haven't tested X? But we know it's available? 

So is ""exert"" a possible word? 

Also, we know T is at position 5? 

But let me verify with the previous constraints:

In ""exert"": 
   E is at position 1? We haven't tried E at position1 before? So it's possible? 
   R is at position4? We haven't tried R at position4? So it might be correct? 
   The other positions: 
        Position2: X? We don't know? 
        Position3: E? That's a duplicate? 

But we don't know if the word has duplicates? 

But due to the constraints, this seems a good candidate? 

However, we can also try to think of other words? 

Other words for pattern A: 
   ""E*RT"": 
        ""exert"" (as above) 
        ""ebert""? Not English? 
        ""elect"": L and C? Eliminated? 
        ""enter"": N? Eliminated? 
        ""erupt"": R and U? But R at4? Wait: 
            E R U P T? -> positions: 
              E(1), R(2)? But R cannot be at position2? Therefore, invalid? 
        ""ember"": M eliminated? 
        ""edict"": D and C? C eliminated? 
        ""evite"": V I T E? Doesn't end with R T? 
        ""ennui"": N eliminated? 

So ""exert"" may be the only common word? 

Alternatively, maybe I missed a word? 

Pattern B (E at position3): ? ? E R T? 
   Words: 
        ""BERTH"" -> doesn't end with T? 
        ""PERTH"" -> P E R T H? Doesn't fit? 
        ""YERST"" -> S eliminated? 
        ""PERST"" -> P E R S T? S eliminated? 
        ""VERT"" -> too short? 

   No? 

So perhaps ""exert"" is the best candidate? 

But note: we also have duplicate E? In ""exert"", there are two E's? 
But the feedback hasn't indicated duplicates? But it's possible? 

Given that, and that it matches the pattern? 

So I will guess ""exert""?

But let me double-check the constraints:
   E at position1: not tested? 
   X: not tested? 
   E at position3: might be a separate E? 
   R at position4: tested for the first time? 
   T at position5: we know is correct? 

Also, we avoid all eliminated letters? 

Are there other possibilities? 

Perhaps E is at position3 and R at4? For pattern B: 
   Then the word has two positions free? 

   How about ""DRIVE"": D R I V E? Doesn't end with T? 
   ""WRITE"": W R I T E? But R at2? Invalid? 
   ""GRATE"": G R A T E? A eliminated? 
   ""PRICE"": P R I C E? C eliminated? 
   ""TRUCE"": R at position3? Wait: T(1) R(2) -> invalid R at2? 

   Alternatively: 
        Position1: ?, Position2: ?, Position3: E, Position4: R, Position5: T? 
        Example: ""BLERT""? Not English? 
        ""QUERT""? Not English?

   Another: ""DEERT""? Not English? 

   There's ""THERE""? Doesn't end with T? 

   It seems pattern A has more common words? 

Therefore, I choose ""exert"".

But note: we only have 6 guesses? But we are at guess 6? 

Actually, the game says ""6 tries"", and we have done 5? So next is our 6th guess? 

But in guess 5: merit? And now we are at guess 6? 

So we must make the sixth guess? 

Therefore, I will guess ""exert""

But if ""exert"" is the word? Then:
   Position1: E -> we have E at1? The feedback would tell if correct? 
   Position2: X -> new letter? 
   Position3: E -> duplicate? 
   Position4: R -> which should be correct? 
   Position5: T -> correct. 

But we'll see? 

Alternatively, is there a word without duplicate? 

Pattern A: E ? ? R T? Without duplicate E? 

Example: ""EXURT""? Not English? 

""ECRIT""? Not English? 

So very few words? 

Alternatively, pattern B without duplicates: 
   ? ? E R T? 
   Example: 
     ""AVERT"": A eliminated? 
     ""BEHERT""? Not English? 
     ""DEART""? Not English? 
     ""FEINT""? Doesn't end with RT? 
     ""GEAR""? Short? 
     ""HEART"": A eliminated? 
     ""MELRT""? Not English? 
     ""PEART""? A? 
     ""QUIRT""? Q U I R T? R at4? But Q at1, U at2? 
         ""QUIRT"" is an English word? 
         But Q U I R T: positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), R(4), T(5)? But I is eliminated? 
     ""WEIRD""? Doesn't end with T? 

So probably ""exert"" is the best candidate? 

Therefore, we guess ""exert"".

### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Letters not in word (x):** C, A, N, O, L, S, M, I  
- **Letters in word (–):** R (not positions 1, 2, or 3), E (not positions 2, 4, or 5)  
- **Correct position (✓):** T (position 5)  
- **Deductions:**  
  - R must be in position 4 (only untested position left).  
  - E must be in position 1 or 3 (positions 2, 4, and 5 eliminated).  
  - Secret word pattern: `[Position 1: E or new]` `[Position 2: New]` `[Position 3: E or new]` [R] [T]  
  - Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Position 4 is R** (since tested and wrong in positions 1–3). Position 5 is T (confirmed).  
2. **E must be in position 1 or 3** (all other positions tested and wrong).  
   - If E is in position 1, the word starts with E.  
   - If E is in position 3, the third letter is E.  
3. Common words fitting the pattern and constraints:  
   - Pattern `E _ _ R T`:  
     - ""**EXERT**"" fits (E at 1, X and E at 3, R at 4, T at 5).  
     X is untested; E is duplicated but not ruled out.  
     (Other words like ""ELECT"" fail due to eliminated letters.)  
   - Pattern `_ _ E R T`:  
     - Few valid options (e.g., ""AVERT"" has A; ""QUIRT"" has I).  
     Mostly uncommon or eliminated.  
4. **""EXERT""** maximizes new letter (X) coverage and tests E positions efficiently.  
   - Success would confirm E at 1 and R at 4.  
   - Failure narrows E to position 3.  

### Guess:  
<guess>exert</guess>",exert,"We are given feedback for the fifth guess ""merit"":
- M: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- I: x (not in the word)
- T: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5)

From previous feedback, we also know:
- The word contains R and E (confirmed by multiple guesses).
- R has been tried at positions 2 (crane), 1 (roles), and 3 (merit) — all wrong. So R must be in position 4? (since positions 1,2,3 are eliminated and we only have 5 positions).
- E has been tried at positions 5 (crane), 4 (roles), and 2 (merit) — all wrong. So E must be in position 1 or 3? (positions 1 and 3 are untested).

Also, eliminated letters: C, A, N, O, L, S, M, I (from all previous feedback).

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We know T is in the word and is at position 5. So the word ends with T.

Therefore, the secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ T

Constraints:
- R must be in position 4? (since positions 1,2,3 are already tested and wrong). We have not tried R at position 4 or maybe position 5? But position 5 is T? So R must be at 4? 
  - Because R cannot be at 1 (from roles), 2 (crane), 3 (merit). Therefore, only position 4 left? 
  - So we can fix R at position 4? 
- E must be in the word but not at 2 (merit), 4 (roles), or 5 (crane). And since position 4 is R? Then E must be at position 1 or 3? 

So the pattern possibilities:
Position 1: must be E? Or another letter? But E has to be in one of the remaining positions? 
Position 3: could be E? Or position 1?
Position 2: unknown letter? But not E? 

Therefore, possible word structures:
Option 1: E ? ? R T
Option 2: ? E ? R T   -> but E at position 2 has been tested and we know it's wrong? So that option is not allowed? Because from merit: E(-) at position 2? Meaning the word has E but not at 2? 
Option 3: ? ? E R T

Therefore, patterns are:
Pattern A: E ? ? R T
Pattern B: ? ? E R T   (with E at position 3)

We must fill the middle positions with available letters? But note: pattern A has position 2 and 3 to fill? Pattern B has position 1 and 2 to fill? And both must include only available letters? 

We also have two other letters to determine? 

Let's think about words ending with ""RT"" and having E? 

Pattern A: E _ _ R T? That would be E? ? R T? So four letters? Wait: position 1: E, position 2: unknown, position 3: unknown, position 4: R, position 5: T. 

Pattern B: similarly: position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: E, position 4: R, position 5: T.

We must find a valid English word? 

Pattern A: E _ _ R T? Is this possible? 
   Examples: 
     EERIE? But has duplicate E? And R at 4? But E at 1? But EERIE: E E R I E? Positions: E(1), E(2), R(3)? Wait no? 
     We need two middle letters? 

   How about: 
     ""EIDER"": E I D E R? But that doesn't fit _ _ _ R T? Because the last letter is R? Not T? 
     ""EGRET"": but eliminated? We know O and S? Also, T at end? But E G R E T? Pattern: E(1), G(2), R(3), E(4), T(5)? But that places R at 3? But R must be at 4? 

   Actually, pattern A fixes R at position 4? So the word must be four letters? Wait: five: 
     1: E, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: T.

   So the string at positions 3 and 4: ? R? Then the last is T? 

   Words:  ... R T? 

   Common words: 
      ""alert"" -> but eliminated? L? 
      ""exert"": E X E R T? 
        Positions: E(1), X(2), E(3), R(4), T(5)? 
        This fits pattern A: E ? ? R T? The middle positions: X at2, E at3? 
        Also, E is at position3? But we are allowed E? However, we have E at two positions? 

        But note: we know the word must have E? And we are testing E at position 1? But in ""exert"": E is at position1 and position3? 

        Also, the eliminated letters: 
          C, A, N, O, L, S, M, I? 
          X and E are available? 

        So ""exert"" is a candidate? 

Pattern B: ? ? E R T? 
   Examples: 
     ""PERT"": only 4 letters? 
     ""INERT"": but I and N eliminated? 
     ""ALERT"": eliminated? 
     ""OVERT"": O eliminated? 

     How about: 
        ""UPSET"": but S is eliminated? 
        ""EVERY"": doesn't end with T? 
        ""BERTH"": doesn't end with T? 
        Other words ending in ""ERT""? 
          ""PERT"" -> not 5? 
          ""EXPERT"": 5? But E X P E R T? 
          ""insert"": S? 
          ""DESERT"": D E S E R T? S eliminated? 

     Consider ""expert"": but that is 6 letters? 
     No: expert is 6? 

     How about ""BERTH""? No: ends with H? 

     ""INERT"" is eliminated? 

     Another: ""PREFIX""? Too long? 

     So pattern B seems harder? 

Therefore, let's focus on pattern A: E _ _ R T? 

But note: the word ""exert"" fits: 
   E(1), X(2), E(3), R(4), T(5)

But we need to check the feedback: 
   We know E is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? 
   Also, in ""exert"", E is at position 1 and 3? 
   But the constraint: E must be present? But it might be twice? 

However, we haven't tested X? But we know it's available? 

So is ""exert"" a possible word? 

Also, we know T is at position 5? 

But let me verify with the previous constraints:

In ""exert"": 
   E is at position 1? We haven't tried E at position1 before? So it's possible? 
   R is at position4? We haven't tried R at position4? So it might be correct? 
   The other positions: 
        Position2: X? We don't know? 
        Position3: E? That's a duplicate? 

But we don't know if the word has duplicates? 

But due to the constraints, this seems a good candidate? 

However, we can also try to think of other words? 

Other words for pattern A: 
   ""E*RT"": 
        ""exert"" (as above) 
        ""ebert""? Not English? 
        ""elect"": L and C? Eliminated? 
        ""enter"": N? Eliminated? 
        ""erupt"": R and U? But R at4? Wait: 
            E R U P T? -> positions: 
              E(1), R(2)? But R cannot be at position2? Therefore, invalid? 
        ""ember"": M eliminated? 
        ""edict"": D and C? C eliminated? 
        ""evite"": V I T E? Doesn't end with R T? 
        ""ennui"": N eliminated? 

So ""exert"" may be the only common word? 

Alternatively, maybe I missed a word? 

Pattern B (E at position3): ? ? E R T? 
   Words: 
        ""BERTH"" -> doesn't end with T? 
        ""PERTH"" -> P E R T H? Doesn't fit? 
        ""YERST"" -> S eliminated? 
        ""PERST"" -> P E R S T? S eliminated? 
        ""VERT"" -> too short? 

   No? 

So perhaps ""exert"" is the best candidate? 

But note: we also have duplicate E? In ""exert"", there are two E's? 
But the feedback hasn't indicated duplicates? But it's possible? 

Given that, and that it matches the pattern? 

So I will guess ""exert""?

But let me double-check the constraints:
   E at position1: not tested? 
   X: not tested? 
   E at position3: might be a separate E? 
   R at position4: tested for the first time? 
   T at position5: we know is correct? 

Also, we avoid all eliminated letters? 

Are there other possibilities? 

Perhaps E is at position3 and R at4? For pattern B: 
   Then the word has two positions free? 

   How about ""DRIVE"": D R I V E? Doesn't end with T? 
   ""WRITE"": W R I T E? But R at2? Invalid? 
   ""GRATE"": G R A T E? A eliminated? 
   ""PRICE"": P R I C E? C eliminated? 
   ""TRUCE"": R at position3? Wait: T(1) R(2) -> invalid R at2? 

   Alternatively: 
        Position1: ?, Position2: ?, Position3: E, Position4: R, Position5: T? 
        Example: ""BLERT""? Not English? 
        ""QUERT""? Not English?

   Another: ""DEERT""? Not English? 

   There's ""THERE""? Doesn't end with T? 

   It seems pattern A has more common words? 

Therefore, I choose ""exert"".

But note: we only have 6 guesses? But we are at guess 6? 

Actually, the game says ""6 tries"", and we have done 5? So next is our 6th guess? 

But in guess 5: merit? And now we are at guess 6? 

So we must make the sixth guess? 

Therefore, I will guess ""exert""

But if ""exert"" is the word? Then:
   Position1: E -> we have E at1? The feedback would tell if correct? 
   Position2: X -> new letter? 
   Position3: E -> duplicate? 
   Position4: R -> which should be correct? 
   Position5: T -> correct. 

But we'll see? 

Alternatively, is there a word without duplicate? 

Pattern A: E ? ? R T? Without duplicate E? 

Example: ""EXURT""? Not English? 

""ECRIT""? Not English? 

So very few words? 

Alternatively, pattern B without duplicates: 
   ? ? E R T? 
   Example: 
     ""AVERT"": A eliminated? 
     ""BEHERT""? Not English? 
     ""DEART""? Not English? 
     ""FEINT""? Doesn't end with RT? 
     ""GEAR""? Short? 
     ""HEART"": A eliminated? 
     ""MELRT""? Not English? 
     ""PEART""? A? 
     ""QUIRT""? Q U I R T? R at4? But Q at1, U at2? 
         ""QUIRT"" is an English word? 
         But Q U I R T: positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), R(4), T(5)? But I is eliminated? 
     ""WEIRD""? Doesn't end with T? 

So probably ""exert"" is the best candidate? 

Therefore, we guess ""exert"".

<guess>exert</guess>### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Letters not in word (x):** C, A, N, O, L, S, M, I  
- **Letters in word (–):** R (not positions 1, 2, or 3), E (not positions 2, 4, or 5)  
- **Correct position (✓):** T (position 5)  
- **Deductions:**  
  - R must be in position 4 (only untested position left).  
  - E must be in position 1 or 3 (positions 2, 4, and 5 eliminated).  
  - Secret word pattern: `[Position 1: E or new]` `[Position 2: New]` `[Position 3: E or new]` [R] [T]  
  - Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Position 4 is R** (since tested and wrong in positions 1–3). Position 5 is T (confirmed).  
2. **E must be in position 1 or 3** (all other positions tested and wrong).  
   - If E is in position 1, the word starts with E.  
   - If E is in position 3, the third letter is E.  
3. Common words fitting the pattern and constraints:  
   - Pattern `E _ _ R T`:  
     - ""**EXERT**"" fits (E at 1, X and E at 3, R at 4, T at 5).  
     X is untested; E is duplicated but not ruled out.  
     (Other words like ""ELECT"" fail due to eliminated letters.)  
   - Pattern `_ _ E R T`:  
     - Few valid options (e.g., ""AVERT"" has A; ""QUIRT"" has I).  
     Mostly uncommon or eliminated.  
4. **""EXERT""** maximizes new letter (X) coverage and tests E positions efficiently.  
   - Success would confirm E at 1 and R at 4.  
   - Failure narrows E to position 3.
