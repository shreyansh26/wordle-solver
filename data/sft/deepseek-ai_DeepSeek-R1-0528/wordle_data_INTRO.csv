We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 This means:
   - C is not in the secret word.
   - R is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it as the second letter).
   - A is not in the word.
   - N is in the word but not in the fourth position.
   - E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
   The secret word does not contain C, A, or E.
   The secret word does contain R and N, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since R was guessed in position 2 and is present but misplaced, it must be in a position other than 2.
 Similarly, N was guessed in position 4 and is present but misplaced, so it must be in a position other than 4.

 The secret word has 5 letters. We know it contains R and N, and excludes C, A, E.

 We need to think about possible positions for R and N:
   R cannot be at position 2.
   N cannot be at position 4.

 We also have to avoid using the excluded letters: C, A, E.

 Let's think of a word that includes R and N, and uses other common letters that haven't been tried.

 We also should avoid placing R in the second position and N in the fourth position.

 Considering this, let's try to come up with a word that:
   - Has R in one of positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (not 2)
   - Has N in one of positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (not 4)

 Example words? Let's brainstorm:

 We can start with words that begin with R? But note: we don't know if R can be at the start.

 Alternatively, we can look for words that have R and N without C, A, E.

 Some common words: 
   ""ROUND"" - but has O and U? And we don't know about O and U yet. Also, positions: 
        R at 1 (which is allowed), N at 4 -> BUT we know N cannot be at position 4. So skip.

   ""BORNS"" - not a word. 
   ""HORNS"": 
        H O R N S
        R is at position 3: that's allowed (not position 2).
        N is at position 4: but we cannot place N at 4? So skip.

   ""RUNNY"": 
        R is at position 1 -> allowed.
        N is at positions 4 and 5 -> we know N can't be at 4? Actually, we don't know about two N's? 
        But our feedback for ""crane"" showed only one N (since we had one N and it was misplaced at 4). 
        So if the word has two N's, that might be okay? But our feedback doesn't tell us the frequency? 
        Actually, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates unless the secret word has duplicates.

 Our feedback for ""crane"" had only one N marked. But note the secret word might have more than one N? 
 However, since in our guess ""crane"" we have one N and it was marked as present but misplaced, 
 that doesn't say anything about the possibility of a second N. 

 But the feedback marks each letter separately. In the case of duplicates, if the secret word has two of a letter 
 and the guess has one, then only one is marked? Actually, it's a bit tricky.

 Let me recall: the standard Wordle feedback rules:
   For each letter in the guess, if that letter is in the secret word and not yet accounted for in the feedback, you mark accordingly.
   So if the secret word has two of a letter and the guess has one, then the one will show as present (but maybe in wrong position).

 However, if the secret word has only one R and we put R in the correct position, then we get a ✓. 
 But here, R was marked as present but wrong position.

 Given that, we don't know if R might appear more than once, but our first guess had one R and it was present.

 Similarly for N: one N was present and misplaced.

 So for now, let's assume the secret word contains at least one R and one N, and we don't know about duplicates.

 But we must avoid using C, A, E.

 Let's find words that contain R and N, without C, A, E.

 Let me consider common letters: I, O, U, T, S, L, D, etc.

 Possibilities:
   ""ROUND"": R at 1, N at 4 -> N at 4 is disallowed? Because we guessed N at 4 and it was wrong? 
      So N cannot be at position 4. Hence ""ROUND"" is bad.

   ""TURNS"": 
        T U R N S
        R is at position 3: that's allowed (not 2).
        N is at position 4: that's disallowed -> skip.

   ""BURNS"": 
        B U R N S -> N at 4 -> skip.

   ""RENDS"": 
        R E N D S -> but E is excluded: we cannot use E -> skip.

   ""GRIND"": 
        G R I N D
        R at position 2? -> but position 2 is disallowed for R? Yes, because we tried R at position 2 and it was wrong.
        So that R in position 2 would be incorrect? But wait, in ""GRIND"", R is at position 2? Then it would be wrong? 
          However, our feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2.

        Therefore, ""GRIND"" is not acceptable because it places R at position 2.

   ""DRINK"": 
        D R I N K -> R at position 2 -> skip.

   ""PRINT"": 
        P R I N T -> R at 2 -> skip.

   We need words where R is NOT at position 2 and N is NOT at position 4.

   Consider: ""CRONY"" -> but C is excluded -> skip.

   What about: ""IRONY""
        I R O N Y -> R at position 2 -> skip.

   What about: ""BORNY"" -> not a word? 

   Let me try ""MINOR"": 
        M I N O R
        R is at position 5 -> allowed.
        N is at position 3 -> allowed (since we guessed N at 4, so at 3 might be okay).

   But note: the word must be five letters and valid.

   Also, ""MINOR"": 
        M (we haven't tried), I (not tried), N (we know is present, and here at 3 not 4 -> good), O (not tried), R at 5 -> good.

   And the letters we avoid: no C, A, E.

   Alternatively, ""MOURN"": 
        M O U R N -> R at 4 (allowed) and N at 5 (allowed) -> because 4 and 5 are not 2 and not 4? 
        Wait, N at position 5 is allowed because our feedback said position 4 was wrong, so anywhere else is okay.

   But ""MOURN"" is a word? Yes.

   Let me check: 
        R is at position 4 -> which is allowed? Yes because we only know that R can't be at position 2? 
        And N at position 5 -> which is okay because we only know not position 4.

   However, we also need to consider that in ""MOURN"", the letter U is used. We don't know about U.

   But that's okay because we are trying to get more information.

   Another candidate: ""HORN"" is 4 letters -> too short? ""HORNS"" we rejected because N at 4.

   How about ""ROBIN"": 
        R O B I N -> R at 1 (allowed), N at 5 (allowed) -> no A,E,C -> good.

   Yes, ""ROBIN"" is a word.

   Another: ""URINE"" -> but E is excluded -> skip.

   Between ""MINOR"", ""MOURN"", and ""ROBIN"", I need to pick one.

   Let me see which one covers new letters? We have only tried letters C,R,A,N,E.

   ""ROBIN"" has R,O,B,I,N -> that covers O,B,I which are new.

   ""MINOR"" has M,I,N,O,R -> covers M,I,O.

   ""MOURN"" has M,O,U,R,N -> covers M,O,U.

   Perhaps ""ROBIN"" is a good choice because it places R at the start (which we haven't tried) and N at the end (position 5).

   Also, note that R being at the start is a new position.

   So let's go with ""ROBIN"".

   But wait: what about the positions? 
      We know R should not be at 2? But in ""ROBIN"", R is at 1 -> allowed.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that repositions R and N without using the same positions.

   Another word: ""PRION"" -> not so common.

   Let me stick with ""ROBIN"".

   Why? Because it's a common word and uses new letters.

   So I'll guess ""ROBIN"".

   But note: we are not supposed to reuse the same positions for R and N? Actually, we can, but we know R cannot be at position 2? 
      However, we are putting R at position 1 and N at position 5.

   This seems okay.

   Therefore, our next guess is ""ROBIN"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- N is present but not in position 4.

For the next guess:
- We need a word containing R and N, while excluding C, A, E.
- R must not be placed in position 2 (due to the feedback).
- N must not be placed in position 4 (due to the feedback).
- ""ROBIN"" fits these constraints:
  - R is in position 1 (allowed, since only position 2 is ruled out).
  - N is in position 5 (allowed, since only position 4 is ruled out).
  - It introduces new common letters: O, B, and I.
  - It avoids the excluded letters C, A, E.

This guess aims to test R in a new position (1) and N in a new position (5), while gathering information about other letters.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)
 This means:
   - C is not in the secret word.
   - R is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it as the second letter).
   - A is not in the word.
   - N is in the word but not in the fourth position.
   - E is not in the word.

 So, we know:
   The secret word does not contain C, A, or E.
   The secret word does contain R and N, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since R was guessed in position 2 and is present but misplaced, it must be in a position other than 2.
 Similarly, N was guessed in position 4 and is present but misplaced, so it must be in a position other than 4.

 The secret word has 5 letters. We know it contains R and N, and excludes C, A, E.

 We need to think about possible positions for R and N:
   R cannot be at position 2.
   N cannot be at position 4.

 We also have to avoid using the excluded letters: C, A, E.

 Let's think of a word that includes R and N, and uses other common letters that haven't been tried.

 We also should avoid placing R in the second position and N in the fourth position.

 Considering this, let's try to come up with a word that:
   - Has R in one of positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (not 2)
   - Has N in one of positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (not 4)

 Example words? Let's brainstorm:

 We can start with words that begin with R? But note: we don't know if R can be at the start.

 Alternatively, we can look for words that have R and N without C, A, E.

 Some common words: 
   ""ROUND"" - but has O and U? And we don't know about O and U yet. Also, positions: 
        R at 1 (which is allowed), N at 4 -> BUT we know N cannot be at position 4. So skip.

   ""BORNS"" - not a word. 
   ""HORNS"": 
        H O R N S
        R is at position 3: that's allowed (not position 2).
        N is at position 4: but we cannot place N at 4? So skip.

   ""RUNNY"": 
        R is at position 1 -> allowed.
        N is at positions 4 and 5 -> we know N can't be at 4? Actually, we don't know about two N's? 
        But our feedback for ""crane"" showed only one N (since we had one N and it was misplaced at 4). 
        So if the word has two N's, that might be okay? But our feedback doesn't tell us the frequency? 
        Actually, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates unless the secret word has duplicates.

 Our feedback for ""crane"" had only one N marked. But note the secret word might have more than one N? 
 However, since in our guess ""crane"" we have one N and it was marked as present but misplaced, 
 that doesn't say anything about the possibility of a second N. 

 But the feedback marks each letter separately. In the case of duplicates, if the secret word has two of a letter 
 and the guess has one, then only one is marked? Actually, it's a bit tricky.

 Let me recall: the standard Wordle feedback rules:
   For each letter in the guess, if that letter is in the secret word and not yet accounted for in the feedback, you mark accordingly.
   So if the secret word has two of a letter and the guess has one, then the one will show as present (but maybe in wrong position).

 However, if the secret word has only one R and we put R in the correct position, then we get a ✓. 
 But here, R was marked as present but wrong position.

 Given that, we don't know if R might appear more than once, but our first guess had one R and it was present.

 Similarly for N: one N was present and misplaced.

 So for now, let's assume the secret word contains at least one R and one N, and we don't know about duplicates.

 But we must avoid using C, A, E.

 Let's find words that contain R and N, without C, A, E.

 Let me consider common letters: I, O, U, T, S, L, D, etc.

 Possibilities:
   ""ROUND"": R at 1, N at 4 -> N at 4 is disallowed? Because we guessed N at 4 and it was wrong? 
      So N cannot be at position 4. Hence ""ROUND"" is bad.

   ""TURNS"": 
        T U R N S
        R is at position 3: that's allowed (not 2).
        N is at position 4: that's disallowed -> skip.

   ""BURNS"": 
        B U R N S -> N at 4 -> skip.

   ""RENDS"": 
        R E N D S -> but E is excluded: we cannot use E -> skip.

   ""GRIND"": 
        G R I N D
        R at position 2? -> but position 2 is disallowed for R? Yes, because we tried R at position 2 and it was wrong.
        So that R in position 2 would be incorrect? But wait, in ""GRIND"", R is at position 2? Then it would be wrong? 
          However, our feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2.

        Therefore, ""GRIND"" is not acceptable because it places R at position 2.

   ""DRINK"": 
        D R I N K -> R at position 2 -> skip.

   ""PRINT"": 
        P R I N T -> R at 2 -> skip.

   We need words where R is NOT at position 2 and N is NOT at position 4.

   Consider: ""CRONY"" -> but C is excluded -> skip.

   What about: ""IRONY""
        I R O N Y -> R at position 2 -> skip.

   What about: ""BORNY"" -> not a word? 

   Let me try ""MINOR"": 
        M I N O R
        R is at position 5 -> allowed.
        N is at position 3 -> allowed (since we guessed N at 4, so at 3 might be okay).

   But note: the word must be five letters and valid.

   Also, ""MINOR"": 
        M (we haven't tried), I (not tried), N (we know is present, and here at 3 not 4 -> good), O (not tried), R at 5 -> good.

   And the letters we avoid: no C, A, E.

   Alternatively, ""MOURN"": 
        M O U R N -> R at 4 (allowed) and N at 5 (allowed) -> because 4 and 5 are not 2 and not 4? 
        Wait, N at position 5 is allowed because our feedback said position 4 was wrong, so anywhere else is okay.

   But ""MOURN"" is a word? Yes.

   Let me check: 
        R is at position 4 -> which is allowed? Yes because we only know that R can't be at position 2? 
        And N at position 5 -> which is okay because we only know not position 4.

   However, we also need to consider that in ""MOURN"", the letter U is used. We don't know about U.

   But that's okay because we are trying to get more information.

   Another candidate: ""HORN"" is 4 letters -> too short? ""HORNS"" we rejected because N at 4.

   How about ""ROBIN"": 
        R O B I N -> R at 1 (allowed), N at 5 (allowed) -> no A,E,C -> good.

   Yes, ""ROBIN"" is a word.

   Another: ""URINE"" -> but E is excluded -> skip.

   Between ""MINOR"", ""MOURN"", and ""ROBIN"", I need to pick one.

   Let me see which one covers new letters? We have only tried letters C,R,A,N,E.

   ""ROBIN"" has R,O,B,I,N -> that covers O,B,I which are new.

   ""MINOR"" has M,I,N,O,R -> covers M,I,O.

   ""MOURN"" has M,O,U,R,N -> covers M,O,U.

   Perhaps ""ROBIN"" is a good choice because it places R at the start (which we haven't tried) and N at the end (position 5).

   Also, note that R being at the start is a new position.

   So let's go with ""ROBIN"".

   But wait: what about the positions? 
      We know R should not be at 2? But in ""ROBIN"", R is at 1 -> allowed.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that repositions R and N without using the same positions.

   Another word: ""PRION"" -> not so common.

   Let me stick with ""ROBIN"".

   Why? Because it's a common word and uses new letters.

   So I'll guess ""ROBIN"".

   But note: we are not supposed to reuse the same positions for R and N? Actually, we can, but we know R cannot be at position 2? 
      However, we are putting R at position 1 and N at position 5.

   This seems okay.

   Therefore, our next guess is ""ROBIN"".

<guess>robin</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- N is present but not in position 4.

For the next guess:
- We need a word containing R and N, while excluding C, A, E.
- R must not be placed in position 2 (due to the feedback).
- N must not be placed in position 4 (due to the feedback).
- ""ROBIN"" fits these constraints:
  - R is in position 1 (allowed, since only position 2 is ruled out).
  - N is in position 5 (allowed, since only position 4 is ruled out).
  - It introduces new common letters: O, B, and I.
  - It avoids the excluded letters C, A, E.

This guess aims to test R in a new position (1) and N in a new position (5), while gathering information about other letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, but not in position 2)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not in position 4)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""robin""
  R: - (in word, but not in position 1)  [because we guessed R at position 1 and it's present but wrong position]
  O: - (in word, but not in position 2)
  B: x (not in word)
  I: - (in word, but not in position 4)
  N: - (in word, but not in position 5)

So, combining the information:

Letters known to be in the word: 
  From guess1: R, N
  From guess2: R (again, but we already know), O, I, N (again)
  So the word contains at least: R, N, O, I

But note: R and N were already known, and now we know O and I are also in the word.

Also, we have exclusions: C, A, E, B.

Now, positions:

For R:
  - It cannot be in position 2 (from guess1) and cannot be in position 1 (from guess2). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

For N:
  - It cannot be in position 4 (from guess1) and cannot be in position 5 (from guess2). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

For O:
  - It is in the word but not in position 2 (from guess2). So O can be in 1,3,4,5.

For I:
  - It is in the word but not in position 4 (from guess2). So I can be in 1,2,3,5.

We also know the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we haven't seen duplicates so far.

Now, we have 4 known letters: R, N, O, I. But the word is 5 letters, so there is one more letter we don't know.

We need to find a word that has R, N, O, I and one more letter (not C, A, E, B) and satisfies the position constraints.

Let's list the constraints again:

- R: positions 3,4,5
- N: positions 1,2,3
- O: not 2 -> positions 1,3,4,5
- I: not 4 -> positions 1,2,3,5

And the fifth letter is unknown, but must be a letter that hasn't been excluded (so not C, A, E, B) and not R,N,O,I (if we assume distinct, but we don't know for sure).

But note: we have 4 known letters and one unknown. Since we have 5 positions, and 4 letters, one of these might be duplicated? Or there is a fifth letter.

However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate marks. For example, in ""robin"", we have R, O, I, N all marked as present (but wrong positions) and no indication of duplicates. So it's likely that the word has 5 distinct letters.

Therefore, we are missing one letter. Let's call it X, which is not in {C, A, E, B, R, N, O, I}.

But we don't know X yet.

We need to form a word with R, N, O, I and one more letter.

Possible positions:

Let me denote the positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints:
- R: 3,4,5
- N: 1,2,3
- O: 1,3,4,5 (but not 2)
- I: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)

Now, note that R and N cannot both be in position 3? Because one position can only have one letter.

So let's consider possible positions for N:

Case 1: N at position 1.
  Then:
    Position 1: N
    Then R must be at 3,4, or 5.
    O can be at 3,4,5 (but if R is at 3, then O cannot be at 3, etc.)
    I can be at 2,3,5 (since 1 is taken by N, and 4 is not allowed for I).

Case 2: N at position 2.
  Then:
    Position 2: N
    Then R: 3,4,5
    O: 1,3,4,5 (but 2 is taken)
    I: 1,3,5 (since 2 is taken and 4 not allowed)

Case 3: N at position 3.
  Then:
    Position 3: N
    Then R: 4 or 5 (since 3 is taken)
    O: 1,4,5 (3 taken, and 2 not allowed for O? Actually O cannot be at 2, but 2 is free? But O can be at 1,4,5)
    I: 1,2,5 (since 3 is taken and 4 not allowed)

We also have to place O and I without conflict.

Moreover, we need to choose a fifth letter.

But we don't know the fifth letter, so we need to think of words that fit.

Let me try to think of common words that have R, N, O, I and one more letter.

Possible words:

- ""IRONY"": I, R, O, N, Y -> but we have I, R, O, N and Y. 
  Check positions: 
    We can try to assign: 
        I at 1, R at 2? -> but R cannot be at 2 (from guess1) -> so if we put I at 1, R at 2 is invalid. 
        Alternatively, if we put R at 3: then ""I R O N Y"" would have R at 2? Actually the word ""IRONY"" is I-R-O-N-Y, so:
          Position 1: I -> allowed? I can be at 1? yes.
          Position 2: R -> but R cannot be at 2 -> conflict.

  So ""IRONY"" is invalid because R is forced to position 2.

- ""MINOR"": M, I, N, O, R -> we have M as the fifth letter. 
  Check positions: 
    We can try: 
        M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5.
        Now check constraints:
          R at 5: allowed (since R can be at 5).
          N at 3: allowed (N can be at 3).
          O at 4: allowed (O can be at 4).
          I at 2: allowed (I can be at 2).
        Also, M is new and not excluded.

  But wait, in our guess2 ""robin"", we had O at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. 
  In ""MINOR"", O is at position 4, which is different. So that's okay.

  Also, in ""MINOR"", we have:
      R at 5: which is allowed (R can be 3,4,5) -> 5 is okay.
      N at 3: which is allowed (N can be 1,2,3) -> 3 is okay.
      O at 4: allowed (O can be 1,3,4,5) -> 4 is okay.
      I at 2: allowed (I can be 1,2,3,5) -> 2 is okay.

  So ""MINOR"" seems to fit.

  But note: we have to check if the positions we are assigning are consistent with the feedback.

  However, we haven't tried ""MINOR"" yet, so we can use it as a guess.

- Another word: ""INORB"" - not a word.

- ""NORI"" is 4 letters.

- ""PRION"": P, R, I, O, N -> P is the fifth letter.
  Positions: 
      We can try: P at 1, R at 2 -> but R cannot be at 2 -> invalid.
      Alternatively, if we put R at 3: then ""P R I O N"" -> R at 2? Actually the word is P-R-I-O-N, so R at 2 -> invalid.

  So skip.

- ""ROTIN"" - not common.

- ""ORPIN"" - not common.

- ""NITRO"": N, I, T, R, O -> T is the fifth letter.
  Positions: 
      We can assign: 
        N at 1 (allowed), I at 2 (allowed), T at 3 (new), R at 4 (allowed, since R can be 3,4,5), O at 5 (allowed).
      Check constraints:
        N at 1: allowed.
        I at 2: allowed.
        R at 4: allowed.
        O at 5: allowed.
      Also, T is new and not excluded (excluded are C,A,E,B).

  So ""NITRO"" is a possibility? But is it a word? ""NITRO"" is often used as a prefix, but in Wordle, it might be accepted? 
  Actually, Wordle uses a list of common words. ""NITRO"" is not very common as a standalone word, but ""NITRO"" is in some dictionaries.

  Alternatively, ""INTRO"": I, N, T, R, O -> 
      Positions: I at 1, N at 2, T at 3, R at 4, O at 5.
      Constraints:
        I at 1: allowed.
        N at 2: allowed (N can be 1,2,3) -> 2 is okay.
        R at 4: allowed.
        O at 5: allowed.
      But note: in ""INTRO"", we have N at position 2? That's allowed. And R at 4? Allowed.

  ""INTRO"" is a common word.

  Now, compare ""MINOR"" and ""INTRO"". Both seem to fit.

  But let's see which one we can use to get more information.

  We have to consider that we have two possibilities for the fifth letter: M or T.

  Also, we haven't tried M or T yet.

  We can choose either.

  However, note that in ""MINOR"", we are placing:
      M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5.

  And in ""INTRO"":
      I at 1, N at 2, T at 3, R at 4, O at 5.

  Now, we also have to think about the feedback we got.

  In guess2 (""robin""), we had:
      R at 1: wrong position -> so R is not at 1.
      O at 2: wrong position -> so O is not at 2.
      I at 4: wrong position -> so I is not at 4.
      N at 5: wrong position -> so N is not at 5.

  In ""MINOR"":
      We have O at 4 and I at 2. 
          I at 2: that's a new position for I? Previously we had I at 4 (in ""robin"") and now we are trying at 2? That's okay.
          O at 4: previously we had O at 2 and now at 4? That's okay.

  In ""INTRO"":
      I at 1: new position (previously at 4) -> okay.
      O at 5: new position (previously at 2) -> okay.

  Both are valid.

  But note: we also have the constraint for R: it must be at 3,4,5. In ""MINOR"" it's at 5, in ""INTRO"" at 4 -> both okay.

  And for N: must be at 1,2,3. In ""MINOR"" at 3, in ""INTRO"" at 2 -> both okay.

  Now, which one to choose? We might also consider that ""INTRO"" uses T, which is a very common letter, and we haven't tried T.

  Similarly, ""MINOR"" uses M.

  But we have no information about T or M.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that includes both possibilities? But we don't have to.

  We can also consider that we have 4 known letters and one unknown, so we are trying to find the fifth letter and the positions.

  We have two candidate words: one with M and one with T.

  But there might be more? For example, what about ""ONION""? But that has two O's and two N's? 
      We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates. 
      Also, ""ONION"" has O and N repeated, but we know the word has at least one O and one N, but maybe more? 
      However, in ""robin"", we had one O and one N and both were marked as present (and we didn't get any indication of duplicates). 
      But if the word had two N's, then when we guessed ""robin"" (which has one N at position 5) and the secret word has two N's, 
      then the feedback would still show one N as present? Actually, no: if the secret word has two N's and we guess one N, 
      then we get one N marked as present. But if we guess a position that is not one of the N's, then it would be marked as present? 
      But we don't know the positions.

  However, to be safe, let's assume the word has distinct letters until we see evidence of duplicates.

  So we'll avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

  Therefore, ""ONION"" is not considered.

  Another word: ""RHINO"": R, H, I, N, O -> H is the fifth letter.
      Positions: 
          We can assign: R at 1? -> but R cannot be at 1 (from guess2: R at 1 was wrong). 
          So if we put R at 1, it's invalid. 
          Alternatively, we can put R at 3? Then the word would be: ? ? R ? ? 
          How about: H at 1, I at 2, N at 3? but then R at 3? conflict. 
          Or: H at 1, R at 2 -> but R cannot be at 2. 
          Or: I at 1, H at 2, R at 3 -> then I at 1, H at 2, R at 3, then N and O: 
                N must be at 4 or 5? But N cannot be at 4 (from guess1) and cannot be at 5 (from guess2) -> so no position for N? 
          Therefore, ""RHINO"" is not possible.

  After considering, ""MINOR"" and ""INTRO"" are two good candidates.

  Let me choose ""INTRO"" because it uses T, which is a very common letter, and we might get more information.

  So I'll guess ""INTRO"".

  But wait, let's double-check the positions in ""INTRO"":

      Position 1: I -> allowed? I can be at 1? yes (from feedback, I can be at 1,2,3,5).
      Position 2: N -> allowed? N can be at 1,2,3 -> 2 is allowed.
      Position 3: T -> new letter, no constraint.
      Position 4: R -> allowed? R can be at 3,4,5 -> 4 is allowed.
      Position 5: O -> allowed? O can be at 1,3,4,5 -> 5 is allowed.

  And the letter T is not excluded (excluded are C,A,E,B).

  So ""INTRO"" is a valid guess.

  Alternatively, we could choose ""MINOR"", but let's go with ""INTRO"".

  Therefore, our next guess is ""INTRO"".

<guess>intro</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Excluded Letters**: C, A, E, B (not in the word).
- **Confirmed Letters**: R, N, O, I (all present, but positions unknown).
- **Position Constraints**:
  - R: Cannot be in position 1 (from ""robin"") or 2 (from ""crane""), so must be in 3, 4, or 5.
  - N: Cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"") or 5 (from ""robin""), so must be in 1, 2, or 3.
  - O: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""robin""), so must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
  - I: Cannot be in position 4 (from ""robin""), so must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.

The word must include one additional letter (not C, A, E, B, R, N, O, I) since no duplicates have been indicated in feedback. After evaluating possible words that fit these constraints and use common letters, ""INTRO"" is a strong candidate:
- Positions: I (1), N (2), T (3), R (4), O (5).
- Satisfies all constraints:
  - R is in position 4 (allowed: 3,4,5).
  - N is in position 2 (allowed: 1,2,3).
  - O is in position 5 (allowed: 1,3,4,5).
  - I is in position 1 (allowed: 1,2,3,5).
- Introduces ""T"" (a common untested letter) to gather new information.

<guess>intro</guess>",intro,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, but not in position 2)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not in position 4)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""robin""
  R: - (in word, but not in position 1)  [because we guessed R at position 1 and it's present but wrong position]
  O: - (in word, but not in position 2)
  B: x (not in word)
  I: - (in word, but not in position 4)
  N: - (in word, but not in position 5)

So, combining the information:

Letters known to be in the word: 
  From guess1: R, N
  From guess2: R (again, but we already know), O, I, N (again)
  So the word contains at least: R, N, O, I

But note: R and N were already known, and now we know O and I are also in the word.

Also, we have exclusions: C, A, E, B.

Now, positions:

For R:
  - It cannot be in position 2 (from guess1) and cannot be in position 1 (from guess2). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

For N:
  - It cannot be in position 4 (from guess1) and cannot be in position 5 (from guess2). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

For O:
  - It is in the word but not in position 2 (from guess2). So O can be in 1,3,4,5.

For I:
  - It is in the word but not in position 4 (from guess2). So I can be in 1,2,3,5.

We also know the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we haven't seen duplicates so far.

Now, we have 4 known letters: R, N, O, I. But the word is 5 letters, so there is one more letter we don't know.

We need to find a word that has R, N, O, I and one more letter (not C, A, E, B) and satisfies the position constraints.

Let's list the constraints again:

- R: positions 3,4,5
- N: positions 1,2,3
- O: not 2 -> positions 1,3,4,5
- I: not 4 -> positions 1,2,3,5

And the fifth letter is unknown, but must be a letter that hasn't been excluded (so not C, A, E, B) and not R,N,O,I (if we assume distinct, but we don't know for sure).

But note: we have 4 known letters and one unknown. Since we have 5 positions, and 4 letters, one of these might be duplicated? Or there is a fifth letter.

However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate marks. For example, in ""robin"", we have R, O, I, N all marked as present (but wrong positions) and no indication of duplicates. So it's likely that the word has 5 distinct letters.

Therefore, we are missing one letter. Let's call it X, which is not in {C, A, E, B, R, N, O, I}.

But we don't know X yet.

We need to form a word with R, N, O, I and one more letter.

Possible positions:

Let me denote the positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints:
- R: 3,4,5
- N: 1,2,3
- O: 1,3,4,5 (but not 2)
- I: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)

Now, note that R and N cannot both be in position 3? Because one position can only have one letter.

So let's consider possible positions for N:

Case 1: N at position 1.
  Then:
    Position 1: N
    Then R must be at 3,4, or 5.
    O can be at 3,4,5 (but if R is at 3, then O cannot be at 3, etc.)
    I can be at 2,3,5 (since 1 is taken by N, and 4 is not allowed for I).

Case 2: N at position 2.
  Then:
    Position 2: N
    Then R: 3,4,5
    O: 1,3,4,5 (but 2 is taken)
    I: 1,3,5 (since 2 is taken and 4 not allowed)

Case 3: N at position 3.
  Then:
    Position 3: N
    Then R: 4 or 5 (since 3 is taken)
    O: 1,4,5 (3 taken, and 2 not allowed for O? Actually O cannot be at 2, but 2 is free? But O can be at 1,4,5)
    I: 1,2,5 (since 3 is taken and 4 not allowed)

We also have to place O and I without conflict.

Moreover, we need to choose a fifth letter.

But we don't know the fifth letter, so we need to think of words that fit.

Let me try to think of common words that have R, N, O, I and one more letter.

Possible words:

- ""IRONY"": I, R, O, N, Y -> but we have I, R, O, N and Y. 
  Check positions: 
    We can try to assign: 
        I at 1, R at 2? -> but R cannot be at 2 (from guess1) -> so if we put I at 1, R at 2 is invalid. 
        Alternatively, if we put R at 3: then ""I R O N Y"" would have R at 2? Actually the word ""IRONY"" is I-R-O-N-Y, so:
          Position 1: I -> allowed? I can be at 1? yes.
          Position 2: R -> but R cannot be at 2 -> conflict.

  So ""IRONY"" is invalid because R is forced to position 2.

- ""MINOR"": M, I, N, O, R -> we have M as the fifth letter. 
  Check positions: 
    We can try: 
        M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5.
        Now check constraints:
          R at 5: allowed (since R can be at 5).
          N at 3: allowed (N can be at 3).
          O at 4: allowed (O can be at 4).
          I at 2: allowed (I can be at 2).
        Also, M is new and not excluded.

  But wait, in our guess2 ""robin"", we had O at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. 
  In ""MINOR"", O is at position 4, which is different. So that's okay.

  Also, in ""MINOR"", we have:
      R at 5: which is allowed (R can be 3,4,5) -> 5 is okay.
      N at 3: which is allowed (N can be 1,2,3) -> 3 is okay.
      O at 4: allowed (O can be 1,3,4,5) -> 4 is okay.
      I at 2: allowed (I can be 1,2,3,5) -> 2 is okay.

  So ""MINOR"" seems to fit.

  But note: we have to check if the positions we are assigning are consistent with the feedback.

  However, we haven't tried ""MINOR"" yet, so we can use it as a guess.

- Another word: ""INORB"" - not a word.

- ""NORI"" is 4 letters.

- ""PRION"": P, R, I, O, N -> P is the fifth letter.
  Positions: 
      We can try: P at 1, R at 2 -> but R cannot be at 2 -> invalid.
      Alternatively, if we put R at 3: then ""P R I O N"" -> R at 2? Actually the word is P-R-I-O-N, so R at 2 -> invalid.

  So skip.

- ""ROTIN"" - not common.

- ""ORPIN"" - not common.

- ""NITRO"": N, I, T, R, O -> T is the fifth letter.
  Positions: 
      We can assign: 
        N at 1 (allowed), I at 2 (allowed), T at 3 (new), R at 4 (allowed, since R can be 3,4,5), O at 5 (allowed).
      Check constraints:
        N at 1: allowed.
        I at 2: allowed.
        R at 4: allowed.
        O at 5: allowed.
      Also, T is new and not excluded (excluded are C,A,E,B).

  So ""NITRO"" is a possibility? But is it a word? ""NITRO"" is often used as a prefix, but in Wordle, it might be accepted? 
  Actually, Wordle uses a list of common words. ""NITRO"" is not very common as a standalone word, but ""NITRO"" is in some dictionaries.

  Alternatively, ""INTRO"": I, N, T, R, O -> 
      Positions: I at 1, N at 2, T at 3, R at 4, O at 5.
      Constraints:
        I at 1: allowed.
        N at 2: allowed (N can be 1,2,3) -> 2 is okay.
        R at 4: allowed.
        O at 5: allowed.
      But note: in ""INTRO"", we have N at position 2? That's allowed. And R at 4? Allowed.

  ""INTRO"" is a common word.

  Now, compare ""MINOR"" and ""INTRO"". Both seem to fit.

  But let's see which one we can use to get more information.

  We have to consider that we have two possibilities for the fifth letter: M or T.

  Also, we haven't tried M or T yet.

  We can choose either.

  However, note that in ""MINOR"", we are placing:
      M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5.

  And in ""INTRO"":
      I at 1, N at 2, T at 3, R at 4, O at 5.

  Now, we also have to think about the feedback we got.

  In guess2 (""robin""), we had:
      R at 1: wrong position -> so R is not at 1.
      O at 2: wrong position -> so O is not at 2.
      I at 4: wrong position -> so I is not at 4.
      N at 5: wrong position -> so N is not at 5.

  In ""MINOR"":
      We have O at 4 and I at 2. 
          I at 2: that's a new position for I? Previously we had I at 4 (in ""robin"") and now we are trying at 2? That's okay.
          O at 4: previously we had O at 2 and now at 4? That's okay.

  In ""INTRO"":
      I at 1: new position (previously at 4) -> okay.
      O at 5: new position (previously at 2) -> okay.

  Both are valid.

  But note: we also have the constraint for R: it must be at 3,4,5. In ""MINOR"" it's at 5, in ""INTRO"" at 4 -> both okay.

  And for N: must be at 1,2,3. In ""MINOR"" at 3, in ""INTRO"" at 2 -> both okay.

  Now, which one to choose? We might also consider that ""INTRO"" uses T, which is a very common letter, and we haven't tried T.

  Similarly, ""MINOR"" uses M.

  But we have no information about T or M.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that includes both possibilities? But we don't have to.

  We can also consider that we have 4 known letters and one unknown, so we are trying to find the fifth letter and the positions.

  We have two candidate words: one with M and one with T.

  But there might be more? For example, what about ""ONION""? But that has two O's and two N's? 
      We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates. 
      Also, ""ONION"" has O and N repeated, but we know the word has at least one O and one N, but maybe more? 
      However, in ""robin"", we had one O and one N and both were marked as present (and we didn't get any indication of duplicates). 
      But if the word had two N's, then when we guessed ""robin"" (which has one N at position 5) and the secret word has two N's, 
      then the feedback would still show one N as present? Actually, no: if the secret word has two N's and we guess one N, 
      then we get one N marked as present. But if we guess a position that is not one of the N's, then it would be marked as present? 
      But we don't know the positions.

  However, to be safe, let's assume the word has distinct letters until we see evidence of duplicates.

  So we'll avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

  Therefore, ""ONION"" is not considered.

  Another word: ""RHINO"": R, H, I, N, O -> H is the fifth letter.
      Positions: 
          We can assign: R at 1? -> but R cannot be at 1 (from guess2: R at 1 was wrong). 
          So if we put R at 1, it's invalid. 
          Alternatively, we can put R at 3? Then the word would be: ? ? R ? ? 
          How about: H at 1, I at 2, N at 3? but then R at 3? conflict. 
          Or: H at 1, R at 2 -> but R cannot be at 2. 
          Or: I at 1, H at 2, R at 3 -> then I at 1, H at 2, R at 3, then N and O: 
                N must be at 4 or 5? But N cannot be at 4 (from guess1) and cannot be at 5 (from guess2) -> so no position for N? 
          Therefore, ""RHINO"" is not possible.

  After considering, ""MINOR"" and ""INTRO"" are two good candidates.

  Let me choose ""INTRO"" because it uses T, which is a very common letter, and we might get more information.

  So I'll guess ""INTRO"".

  But wait, let's double-check the positions in ""INTRO"":

      Position 1: I -> allowed? I can be at 1? yes (from feedback, I can be at 1,2,3,5).
      Position 2: N -> allowed? N can be at 1,2,3 -> 2 is allowed.
      Position 3: T -> new letter, no constraint.
      Position 4: R -> allowed? R can be at 3,4,5 -> 4 is allowed.
      Position 5: O -> allowed? O can be at 1,3,4,5 -> 5 is allowed.

  And the letter T is not excluded (excluded are C,A,E,B).

  So ""INTRO"" is a valid guess.

  Alternatively, we could choose ""MINOR"", but let's go with ""INTRO"".

  Therefore, our next guess is ""INTRO"".

<guess>intro</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Excluded Letters**: C, A, E, B (not in the word).
- **Confirmed Letters**: R, N, O, I (all present, but positions unknown).
- **Position Constraints**:
  - R: Cannot be in position 1 (from ""robin"") or 2 (from ""crane""), so must be in 3, 4, or 5.
  - N: Cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"") or 5 (from ""robin""), so must be in 1, 2, or 3.
  - O: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""robin""), so must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
  - I: Cannot be in position 4 (from ""robin""), so must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.

The word must include one additional letter (not C, A, E, B, R, N, O, I) since no duplicates have been indicated in feedback. After evaluating possible words that fit these constraints and use common letters, ""INTRO"" is a strong candidate:
- Positions: I (1), N (2), T (3), R (4), O (5).
- Satisfies all constraints:
  - R is in position 4 (allowed: 3,4,5).
  - N is in position 2 (allowed: 1,2,3).
  - O is in position 5 (allowed: 1,3,4,5).
  - I is in position 1 (allowed: 1,2,3,5).
- Introduces ""T"" (a common untested letter) to gather new information.",Guess 3: intro -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) N(✓) T(✓) R(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
