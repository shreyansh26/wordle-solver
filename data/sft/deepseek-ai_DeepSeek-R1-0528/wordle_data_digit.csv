We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all fairly common in English words.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider letters like S, T, B, D, G, H, I, L, O, P, U, etc.

 A good second guess should use common letters that we haven't tried yet and that are likely to appear in English words.

 Some common starting letters we haven't used: S, T, L, O, P, I, etc.

 We can try a word that includes S, T, and other common letters.

 Example words: ""sight"", ""pound"", ""built"", ""stomp"", etc.

 However, note that we must avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's try to form a word with high-frequency letters that are still available.

 Consider the word ""SLOTH"": 
   S, L, O, T, H. None of these are in the forbidden set (C,R,A,N,E).

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" or ""BUILT"" or ""STOMP"".

 But note: we want to maximize the information. Using more common letters is better.

 Another idea: ""TOILS"" or ""POUCH"" (but POUCH has P, O, U, C, H; but C is forbidden, so no).

 We must avoid C, so ""POUCH"" is invalid because of the C.

 Let's try ""STOMP"": 
   S, T, O, M, P. None of these are forbidden.

 But we can also consider ""SHIFT"": S, H, I, F, T. Also acceptable.

 However, we might want to use a word that has letters that are more common in 5-letter words.

 According to letter frequency in English, after removing C, R, A, N, E, the next most common are: S, T, I, O, L, etc.

 So, let's choose a word that uses S, T, I, O, and L if possible.

 Example: ""TOILS"" -> T, O, I, L, S. All allowed.

 Another: ""BUOYS"" -> B, U, O, Y, S. Also allowed.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.

 I think ""TOILS"" is a good candidate because it uses T, O, I, L, S, which are common and we haven't tried.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" (P, I, O, U, S) is also good.

 However, we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the rules don't say, so we assume no duplicates? Actually, the example didn't have duplicates, but the rules don't forbid it. However, for the first guess we used 5 distinct and they were all absent, so the secret word must be composed of letters not in {C,R,A,N,E} and possibly with duplicates? But typically in such games, duplicates are allowed but not common. We'll assume they are allowed but try to avoid duplicates in our guess to cover more letters.

 So, let's pick a word with 5 new distinct letters.

 I'll go with ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S.

 But wait, let me check if ""TOILS"" is a valid word: yes, it means tools or utensils, or can be a verb.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SLIPT"" (an archaic form of slipped) but that might be too obscure. Better to use common words.

 Another common word: ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T. This uses M instead of L. But M is also a common letter.

 However, we have to avoid E, so ""MOIST"" is acceptable.

 Let me compare:
   ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S
   ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> same letters except M vs L.

 Since we don't know, both are fine. I'll choose ""MOIST"" because it has M and T which are common.

 But note: we are going to get feedback on each position, so the order matters for the feedback.

 However, for the second guess, we are more interested in which letters are present.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice.

 But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E. ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T. None of these are forbidden.

 So, I'll go with ""MOIST"".

 However, let me think of other options: ""BUILD"" -> B, U, I, L, D. Also good, but we haven't covered S and T.

 Since S and T are very common, I think including them is better.

 Therefore, I choose ""MOIST"".
</think>
After the first guess ""crane"" received all 'x' feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word using entirely new letters to maximize information. 

Considering English letter frequency (excluding C/R/A/N/E), common letters like S, T, O, I, L, M, and H are strong candidates. The word **""MOIST""** fits well: 
- Uses 5 new, high-frequency letters (M, O, I, S, T) 
- Covers vowels (O, I) and consonants (M, S, T)  
- Avoids repeats and forbidden letters  

This choice will efficiently narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

However, for the first guess we used 5 distinct and they were all absent, so the secret word must be composed of letters not in {C,R,A,N,E} and possibly with duplicates? But typically in such games, duplicates are allowed but not common. We\'ll assume they are allowed but try to avoid duplicates in our guess to cover more letters.\n\n So, let\'s pick a word with 5 new distinct letters.\n\n I\'ll go with ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S.\n\n But wait, let me check if ""TOILS"" is a valid word: yes, it means tools or utensils, or can be a verb.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""SLIPT"" (an archaic form of slipped) but that might be too obscure. Better to use common words.\n\n Another common word: ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T. This uses M instead of L. But M is also a common letter.\n\n However, we have to avoid E, so ""MOIST"" is acceptable.\n\n Let me compare:\n   ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S\n   ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> same letters except M vs L.\n\n Since we don\'t know, both are fine. I\'ll choose ""MOIST"" because it has M and T which are common.\n\n But note: we are going to get feedback on each position, so the order matters for the feedback.\n\n However, for the second guess, we are more interested in which letters are present.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice.\n\n But wait, we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E. ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T. None of these are forbidden.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""MOIST"".\n\n However, let me think of other options: ""BUILD"" -> B, U, I, L, D. Also good, but we haven\'t covered S and T.\n\n Since S and T are very common, I think including them is better.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""MOIST"".After the first guess ""crane"" received all \'x\' feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word using entirely new letters to maximize information. \n\nConsidering English letter frequency (excluding C/R/A/N/E), common letters like S, T, O, I, L, M, and H are strong candidates. The word **""MOIST""** fits well: \n- Uses 5 new, high-frequency letters (M, O, I, S, T) \n- Covers vowels (O, I) and consonants (M, S, T)  \n- Avoids repeats and forbidden letters  \n\nThis choice will efficiently narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given two previous guesses and their feedback:
1. ""crane"": all letters incorrect -> C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
2. ""moist"": 
   - M(x) -> M is not in the word.
   - O(x) -> O is not in the word.
   - I(-) -> I is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - S(x) -> S is not in the word.
   - T(✓) -> T is in the word and in the correct position (specifically, at the last position because T was the last letter in ""moist"").

From this, we know:
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S (all marked x in their respective guesses).
- The letter I is in the secret word, but not in the third position (since we guessed I in the third position and got a '-' meaning it is present but misplaced).
- The letter T is in the secret word and is the last letter (position 5).

So, the secret word has the following known constraints:
- It ends with T (position 5).
- It contains an I, but not at position 3.
- It does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with T (because position 5 is confirmed T).
2. Includes the letter I, and we should place I in a position that is not 3 (since we know position 3 was wrong). However, note that the '-' for I means it must be in the word, so we must include it, and avoid putting it in position 3 again.
3. Avoids all the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.

We also know that in the first guess, we tried 5 letters and none were present. In the second guess, we tried M,O,I,S,T. Now M, O, S are absent, leaving only I and T as present (with T fixed at position 5).

Therefore, the word we choose must:
- Have T at the fifth position.
- Include I (but not at position 3).
- Use letters not in the set {C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S}.

What letters are available? We can consider the rest of the alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Also note, since I is in the word but not in position 3, and we know the position of T (5th), we have to choose positions for I and fill the others with new letters.

We might prioritize high-frequency letters: among the available, common letters are L, H, D, U, B, G, etc.

Structure of the word: _ _ _ _ T

The I must go in one of the first four positions, but not position 3. So possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 4.

Let's brainstorm words ending with T and containing I, using only the allowed letters.

Examples:
- With I at position 1: ""IGHT"" words? But we need 5 letters, and the second and third would be filled. However, common words: LIGHT? But L is allowed. LIGHT has L,I,G,H,T -> positions: I at 1? No, L at 1, I at 2. Let me list:

Possible words:
- I at position 1: 
  - IGUPT? Not a word.
  - IKHUT? Not valid.
  It's hard. Instead, let me think of words ending with T that have an I and use the allowed letters.

Other examples:
- BUILT: B,U,I,L,T -> but U and L are allowed? Let's see: B,U,I,L,T -> T at end. I is at position 3? We must avoid position 3 for I? Remember: in ""moist"", I was at position 3 and got '-', meaning I is in the word but not at position 3. In BUILT, if we put I at position 3, that would be bad? Actually, no: the '-' feedback for I in ""moist"" doesn't restrict us from trying I at position 3 again? Wait, no: the feedback rules say that the '-' means the letter is present but not in that position. So we know I is in the word, so we must include it, but not at position 3 again? Actually, in subsequent guesses, we can try I at position 3 again? But that would be inefficient because we know that position 3 was wrong, so we should avoid putting I there again? The rules don't forbid it, but logically we know it's incorrect. So we should avoid position 3 for I in our next guess.

Therefore, we must place I in position 1,2 or 4.

Words with I at position 2 and ending with T? Example: PILOT? But O is forbidden (we know O is absent). HILT? Only 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

With I at position 4: ??
- The fourth letter is I and last is T: so the pattern: _ _ _ I T. 
Examples: BLITT? Not a word. FLUKE? Doesn't end with IT. 
Words ending with ""IT"": like UNIT? But N is forbidden (from guess1). EXIT? E and X: E forbidden, X may be allowed? But E forbidden.

This is tricky.

Let me list common words ending with T and containing I, using allowed letters.

Allowed consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Vowels: I (we know it's present) and other vowels: U, Y? We also know E and A are forbidden, O forbidden.

So the available vowels are U and Y? And I.

Words:
- DAILY? Doesn't end with T.
- GUILT: G, U, I, L, T -> ends with T? The word is G-U-I-L-T, so positions: G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), T(5) -> but wait, I is at position 3! And we must avoid position 3 for I? Because in the previous guess, I at position 3 was wrong? But note: the feedback was that I is in the word but not at position 3. Therefore, we want I at a different position. So GUILT has I at position 3? We have to avoid that.

Is there a word with I at position 1? Like IGLOO? No O, and doesn't end with T. 
With I at position 2: 
- BITST? No. 
- PILET? Not a word, and E forbidden.
- WITTY: W,I,T,T,Y -> but we are ending with T? Actually W-I-T-T-Y: last letter Y? No, ends with Y.

But note: we don't need to avoid T at other positions? In fact, we know T is present only at position 5? But wait, the feedback for T was a '✓' at position 5. It doesn't say there are no other Ts. However, for now, let's assume we don't know about other Ts? Actually, the feedback will mark duplicates? But we haven't seen any duplicate yet.

Given the constraints, how about words like:
- ""GUILT"" has I at position 3 -> skip because we know I should not be at 3? Actually, in ""GUILT"", if the secret word has I elsewhere and not at 3, then guess ""GUILT"" would give I(-) in position 3? But since we know I is in the word, we want to try a position that we haven't tried for I? We haven't tried positions 1,2,4? Position 4? 

Word with I at position 4: ending with ""IT"" -> _ _ _ I T
Examples: FLUFFY? Not ""IT"". 
  FRUIT? F,R,U,I,T -> F,R,U,I,T: but R is forbidden? Yes, R was in guess1 and marked absent? So no.

How about ""BUILT"": B,U,I,L,T -> but I is at position 3? So we avoid.

Another word: ""QUILT"": Q,U,I,L,T -> I is at position 3? Again, same as GUILT.

Is there a word with I at position 4? Ending with ""IT"": 
  Possible: EXIT? E forbidden.
  UNITY? U,N,I,T,Y -> N forbidden? Yes, from guess1: N absent.
  UNFIT? N forbidden.
  WORST? O and S forbidden? O and S marked absent.

This is difficult. 

Another possibility: I at position 1? ""ITCHY"" -> ends with Y, not T.
""IGLOO"" -> ends with O, forbidden.

What about ""INEPT""? But N and E forbidden? Both absent.

Wait, note: we can use Y? Like ""DAILY"" doesn't end with T. ""MIGHT""? But M and G,H,T: M forbidden? Yes, from guess2: M absent.

Then, let me think of words ending with T and having I at position 1: do any exist? 
  INTRO? N forbidden, and O forbidden.
  INPUT? N forbidden? 
  INSET? N,S,E forbidden.

Not working.

Position 2: _ I _ _ T.
Examples:  LIGHT: L,I,G,H,T -> G and H are allowed? Yes. 
  Positions: I is at position 2? Yes! So pattern: ? I ? ? T
  LIGHT: L at 1, I at 2, G at 3, H at 4, T at 5.

This is a valid word: LIGHT? But we haven't tried L, G, H? They are allowed? Yes.

Could there be others: RIGHT? R forbidden? R is absent.
  BIGHT? B at 1, I at 2, G at 3, H at 4, T at 5 -> valid? BIGHT is a word (it means a bend or coast).
  FIGHT? F,I,G,H,T -> valid.
  DIGIT? G at position 3? D at 1, I at 2, G at 3, I? But duplicate I? Then T? Wait, DIGIT: D-I-G-I-T -> has two I's? The last letter is T? Positions: D(1), I(2), G(3), I(4), T(5). But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback would handle it? However, we are restricted by the letters: but we know I is present? If there are two I's? We don't know. But DIGIT uses I at positions 2 and 4? We don't know if the secret word has duplicates? Possible? But to be safe, let's pick words without duplicates unless necessary.

But note: we haven't tried G, H, L, etc.

A word with I at position 4: _ _ _ I T
Examples: UNLIT? U,N,L,I,T -> N forbidden? Yes.
  UNFIT? N forbidden.
  FLINT? F,L,I,N,T -> N forbidden? Yes.

What about ""DEPTH""? D,E,P,T,H -> E forbidden? Yes.

This is challenging.

Another idea: I at position 1? ""IGAPU""? Not a word.

Or ""TUTTI""? T at both 1 and 5? And U,T? But we end with 'I T'? No.

Perhaps we can pick a word that has I and T (and ends with T) and uses allowed letters, without worrying too much about I's position? But we must place I in position 1,2, or 4? Because position 3 is off-limits for this guess? Actually, no, we can put I in any position (including 3) but since we know it's wrong at position 3, putting it at 3 again would be wasteful? Because it would get a '-' again? And that doesn't give new information about I's position? So we should try a different position.

Therefore, let us try I in position 2? As in LIGHT, BIGHT, DIGIT, etc.?

But DIGIT has two I's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But from the feedback earlier, we haven't encountered duplicates? But the rules don't mention duplicates? We should assume duplicates are possible? But we know the secret word has an I? It might have more? So DIGIT is a possibility? But then the fourth letter is I? So we have I at position 4? Also? Then if we guess DIGIT:
- Duplicate I: which one is marked? The feedback symbol will mark each occurrence? So for DIGIT: D,I,G,I,T.
If the secret word has exactly one I, then the I in position 2 might be marked as '-' and the I at position 4 marked as 'x'? But that would tell us there is only one I? That is good information. But we don't know.

Alternatively, let's pick a word that has only one I? Like ""FIGHT"": F,I,G,H,T -> I at position 2.

Similarly, ""LIGHT"": L,I,G,H,T.

But note: in our previous guess ""moist"", we got T(✓) at position 5. So if we guess ""LIGHT"", the T is at position 5? Good? Yes.

So ""LIGHT"": 
- Letter 1: L
- Letter 2: I
- Letter 3: G
- Letter 4: H
- Letter 5: T

We haven't tried L, G, or H? And they are not forbidden? So it's safe.

Similarly, ""FIGHT"": F, I, G, H, T.

But we don't know which one?

Also note: the secret word might have other letters? The more letters we test, the better? So ""LIGHT"" uses L, I (already known), G, H, T? We already know T and I? So we are testing L, G, H? And placing I at position 2? Which we haven't tried.

Similarly, ""BIGHT"": B, I, G, H, T -> tests B, G, H? And I at 2.

We don't know which letters are more common? But H is fairly common? G also.

I think ""LIGHT"" is a common word? So let's choose that.

But note: the secret word ends with T? Yes. And contains I? Yes. And we avoid position 3 for I? We place I at position 2? So if I is actually in position 2, we will get ✓ for that? Otherwise, '-' or 'x'. 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common letters? G and H? They are both common? So either FIGHT, LIGHT, or BIGHT?

Let me choose ""LIGHT"".

But wait, another possibility: we have not tested D and U? But we can test them later? We have 4 more guesses? We are on guess 3.

Alternatively, to test more letters? We can try a word that doesn't reuse I and T? But we must include T at the end? And we must include I? Because we know I is present? Therefore, we cannot avoid I and T? So we must have at least two letters fixed?

Therefore, good candidate: ""LIGHT""

But let me confirm: Does ""LIGHT"" avoid forbidden letters? 
Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S? L is not in there? G? H? T is present? I is present? So yes.

We are going to guess ""LIGHT"".

But note: we have also considered ""BIGHT"" or ""FIGHT"". However, ""LIGHT"" is a common word? Yes.

So next guess: LIGHT.

</think>
After analyzing the feedback:

1. **First guess ""crane""**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → eliminated from consideration.
2. **Second guess ""moist""**: 
   - M, O, S: Absent → eliminated.
   - I: Present but misplaced (wrong position 3) → must appear in word, but not at position 3.
   - T: Correct and in position 5 → secret word **ends with T**.

**Constraints**:
- Secret word ends with **T**.
- Secret word contains **I**, not in position 3.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.
- Priority: Test new high-frequency letters (B, D, F, G, H, L, U, etc.) while placing I in untried positions (1, 2, or 4).

Ideal third guess:  
- Must end with **T**.
- Must include **I** (avoiding position 3).
- Use letters like G, H, L (common, untested).  
- Candidate: **""LIGHT""**  
  - Ends with T (position 5).  
  - Places I at position 2 (new position to test).  
  - Tests new letters: L, G, H (all untested and common).  
  - Avoids all forbidden letters.

This maximizes information on letter placements and tests new consonants/vowels.

But DIGIT has two I's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But from the feedback earlier, we haven't encountered duplicates? But the rules don't mention duplicates? We should assume duplicates are possible? But we know the secret word has an I? It might have more? So DIGIT is a possibility? But then the fourth letter is I? So we have I at position 4? Also? Then if we guess DIGIT:
- Duplicate I: which one is marked? The feedback symbol will mark each occurrence? So for DIGIT: D,I,G,I,T.
If the secret word has exactly one I, then the I in position 2 might be marked as '-' and the I at position 4 marked as 'x'? But that would tell us there is only one I? That is good information. But we don't know.

Alternatively, let's pick a word that has only one I? Like ""FIGHT"": F,I,G,H,T -> I at position 2.

Similarly, ""LIGHT"": L,I,G,H,T.

But note: in our previous guess ""moist"", we got T(✓) at position 5. So if we guess ""LIGHT"", the T is at position 5? Good? Yes.

So ""LIGHT"": 
- Letter 1: L
- Letter 2: I
- Letter 3: G
- Letter 4: H
- Letter 5: T

We haven't tried L, G, or H? And they are not forbidden? So it's safe.

Similarly, ""FIGHT"": F, I, G, H, T.

But we don't know which one?

Also note: the secret word might have other letters? The more letters we test, the better? So ""LIGHT"" uses L, I (already known), G, H, T? We already know T and I? So we are testing L, G, H? And placing I at position 2? Which we haven't tried.

Similarly, ""BIGHT"": B, I, G, H, T -> tests B, G, H? And I at 2.

We don't know which letters are more common? But H is fairly common? G also.

I think ""LIGHT"" is a common word? So let's choose that.

But note: the secret word ends with T? Yes. And contains I? Yes. And we avoid position 3 for I? We place I at position 2? So if I is actually in position 2, we will get ✓ for that? Otherwise, '-' or 'x'. 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common letters? G and H? They are both common? So either FIGHT, LIGHT, or BIGHT?

Let me choose ""LIGHT"".

But wait, another possibility: we have not tested D and U? But we can test them later? We have 4 more guesses? We are on guess 3.

Alternatively, to test more letters? We can try a word that doesn't reuse I and T? But we must include T at the end? And we must include I? Because we know I is present? Therefore, we cannot avoid I and T? So we must have at least two letters fixed?

Therefore, good candidate: ""LIGHT""

But let me confirm: Does ""LIGHT"" avoid forbidden letters? 
Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S? L is not in there? G? H? T is present? I is present? So yes.

We are going to guess ""LIGHT"".

But note: we have also considered ""BIGHT"" or ""FIGHT"". However, ""LIGHT"" is a common word? Yes.

So next guess: LIGHT.

<guess>light</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

1. **First guess ""crane""**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → eliminated from consideration.
2. **Second guess ""moist""**: 
   - M, O, S: Absent → eliminated.
   - I: Present but misplaced (wrong position 3) → must appear in word, but not at position 3.
   - T: Correct and in position 5 → secret word **ends with T**.

**Constraints**:
- Secret word ends with **T**.
- Secret word contains **I**, not in position 3.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.
- Priority: Test new high-frequency letters (B, D, F, G, H, L, U, etc.) while placing I in untried positions (1, 2, or 4).

- Must include **I** (avoiding position 3).
- Use letters like G, H, L (common, untested).  
- Candidate: **""LIGHT""**  
  - Ends with T (position 5).  
  - Places I at position 2 (new position to test).

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all fairly common in English words.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider letters like S, T, B, D, G, H, I, L, O, P, U, etc.

 A good second guess should use common letters that we haven't tried yet and that are likely to appear in English words.

 Some common starting letters we haven't used: S, T, L, O, P, I, etc.

 We can try a word that includes S, T, and other common letters.

 Example words: ""sight"", ""pound"", ""built"", ""stomp"", etc.

 However, note that we must avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's try to form a word with high-frequency letters that are still available.

 Consider the word ""SLOTH"": 
   S, L, O, T, H. None of these are in the forbidden set (C,R,A,N,E).

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" or ""BUILT"" or ""STOMP"".

 But note: we want to maximize the information. Using more common letters is better.

 Another idea: ""TOILS"" or ""POUCH"" (but POUCH has P, O, U, C, H; but C is forbidden, so no).

 We must avoid C, so ""POUCH"" is invalid because of the C.

 Let's try ""STOMP"": 
   S, T, O, M, P. None of these are forbidden.

 But we can also consider ""SHIFT"": S, H, I, F, T. Also acceptable.

 However, we might want to use a word that has letters that are more common in 5-letter words.

 According to letter frequency in English, after removing C, R, A, N, E, the next most common are: S, T, I, O, L, etc.

 So, let's choose a word that uses S, T, I, O, and L if possible.

 Example: ""TOILS"" -> T, O, I, L, S. All allowed.

 Another: ""BUOYS"" -> B, U, O, Y, S. Also allowed.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.

 I think ""TOILS"" is a good candidate because it uses T, O, I, L, S, which are common and we haven't tried.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" (P, I, O, U, S) is also good.

 However, we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the rules don't say, so we assume no duplicates? Actually, the example didn't have duplicates, but the rules don't forbid it. However, for the first guess we used 5 distinct and they were all absent, so the secret word must be composed of letters not in {C,R,A,N,E} and possibly with duplicates? But typically in such games, duplicates are allowed but not common. We'll assume they are allowed but try to avoid duplicates in our guess to cover more letters.

 So, let's pick a word with 5 new distinct letters.

 I'll go with ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S.

 But wait, let me check if ""TOILS"" is a valid word: yes, it means tools or utensils, or can be a verb.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SLIPT"" (an archaic form of slipped) but that might be too obscure. Better to use common words.

 Another common word: ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T. This uses M instead of L. But M is also a common letter.

 However, we have to avoid E, so ""MOIST"" is acceptable.

 Let me compare:
   ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S
   ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> same letters except M vs L.

 Since we don't know, both are fine. I'll choose ""MOIST"" because it has M and T which are common.

 But note: we are going to get feedback on each position, so the order matters for the feedback.

 However, for the second guess, we are more interested in which letters are present.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice.

 But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E. ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T. None of these are forbidden.

 So, I'll go with ""MOIST"".

 However, let me think of other options: ""BUILD"" -> B, U, I, L, D. Also good, but we haven't covered S and T.

 Since S and T are very common, I think including them is better.

 Therefore, I choose ""MOIST"".After the first guess ""crane"" received all 'x' feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word using entirely new letters to maximize information. 

Considering English letter frequency (excluding C/R/A/N/E), common letters like S, T, O, I, L, M, and H are strong candidates. The word **""MOIST""** fits well: 
- Uses 5 new, high-frequency letters (M, O, I, S, T) 
- Covers vowels (O, I) and consonants (M, S, T)  
- Avoids repeats and forbidden letters  

This choice will efficiently narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given two previous guesses and their feedback:
1. ""crane"": all letters incorrect -> C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
2. ""moist"": 
   - M(x) -> M is not in the word.
   - O(x) -> O is not in the word.
   - I(-) -> I is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - S(x) -> S is not in the word.
   - T(✓) -> T is in the word and in the correct position (specifically, at the last position because T was the last letter in ""moist"").

From this, we know:
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S (all marked x in their respective guesses).
- The letter I is in the secret word, but not in the third position (since we guessed I in the third position and got a '-' meaning it is present but misplaced).
- The letter T is in the secret word and is the last letter (position 5).

So, the secret word has the following known constraints:
- It ends with T (position 5).
- It contains an I, but not at position 3.
- It does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with T (because position 5 is confirmed T).
2. Includes the letter I, and we should place I in a position that is not 3 (since we know position 3 was wrong). However, note that the '-' for I means it must be in the word, so we must include it, and avoid putting it in position 3 again.
3. Avoids all the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.

We also know that in the first guess, we tried 5 letters and none were present. In the second guess, we tried M,O,I,S,T. Now M, O, S are absent, leaving only I and T as present (with T fixed at position 5).

Therefore, the word we choose must:
- Have T at the fifth position.
- Include I (but not at position 3).
- Use letters not in the set {C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S}.

What letters are available? We can consider the rest of the alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Also note, since I is in the word but not in position 3, and we know the position of T (5th), we have to choose positions for I and fill the others with new letters.

We might prioritize high-frequency letters: among the available, common letters are L, H, D, U, B, G, etc.

Structure of the word: _ _ _ _ T

The I must go in one of the first four positions, but not position 3. So possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 4.

Let's brainstorm words ending with T and containing I, using only the allowed letters.

Examples:
- With I at position 1: ""IGHT"" words? But we need 5 letters, and the second and third would be filled. However, common words: LIGHT? But L is allowed. LIGHT has L,I,G,H,T -> positions: I at 1? No, L at 1, I at 2. Let me list:

Possible words:
- I at position 1: 
  - IGUPT? Not a word.
  - IKHUT? Not valid.
  It's hard. Instead, let me think of words ending with T that have an I and use the allowed letters.

Other examples:
- BUILT: B,U,I,L,T -> but U and L are allowed? Let's see: B,U,I,L,T -> T at end. I is at position 3? We must avoid position 3 for I? Remember: in ""moist"", I was at position 3 and got '-', meaning I is in the word but not at position 3. In BUILT, if we put I at position 3, that would be bad? Actually, no: the '-' feedback for I in ""moist"" doesn't restrict us from trying I at position 3 again? Wait, no: the feedback rules say that the '-' means the letter is present but not in that position. So we know I is in the word, so we must include it, but not at position 3 again? Actually, in subsequent guesses, we can try I at position 3 again? But that would be inefficient because we know that position 3 was wrong, so we should avoid putting I there again? The rules don't forbid it, but logically we know it's incorrect. So we should avoid position 3 for I in our next guess.

Therefore, we must place I in position 1,2 or 4.

Words with I at position 2 and ending with T? Example: PILOT? But O is forbidden (we know O is absent). HILT? Only 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

With I at position 4: ??
- The fourth letter is I and last is T: so the pattern: _ _ _ I T. 
Examples: BLITT? Not a word. FLUKE? Doesn't end with IT. 
Words ending with ""IT"": like UNIT? But N is forbidden (from guess1). EXIT? E and X: E forbidden, X may be allowed? But E forbidden.

This is tricky.

Let me list common words ending with T and containing I, using allowed letters.

Allowed consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Vowels: I (we know it's present) and other vowels: U, Y? We also know E and A are forbidden, O forbidden.

So the available vowels are U and Y? And I.

Words:
- DAILY? Doesn't end with T.
- GUILT: G, U, I, L, T -> ends with T? The word is G-U-I-L-T, so positions: G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), T(5) -> but wait, I is at position 3! And we must avoid position 3 for I? Because in the previous guess, I at position 3 was wrong? But note: the feedback was that I is in the word but not at position 3. Therefore, we want I at a different position. So GUILT has I at position 3? We have to avoid that.

Is there a word with I at position 1? Like IGLOO? No O, and doesn't end with T. 
With I at position 2: 
- BITST? No. 
- PILET? Not a word, and E forbidden.
- WITTY: W,I,T,T,Y -> but we are ending with T? Actually W-I-T-T-Y: last letter Y? No, ends with Y.

But note: we don't need to avoid T at other positions? In fact, we know T is present only at position 5? But wait, the feedback for T was a '✓' at position 5. It doesn't say there are no other Ts. However, for now, let's assume we don't know about other Ts? Actually, the feedback will mark duplicates? But we haven't seen any duplicate yet.

Given the constraints, how about words like:
- ""GUILT"" has I at position 3 -> skip because we know I should not be at 3? Actually, in ""GUILT"", if the secret word has I elsewhere and not at 3, then guess ""GUILT"" would give I(-) in position 3? But since we know I is in the word, we want to try a position that we haven't tried for I? We haven't tried positions 1,2,4? Position 4? 

Word with I at position 4: ending with ""IT"" -> _ _ _ I T
Examples: FLUFFY? Not ""IT"". 
  FRUIT? F,R,U,I,T -> F,R,U,I,T: but R is forbidden? Yes, R was in guess1 and marked absent? So no.

How about ""BUILT"": B,U,I,L,T -> but I is at position 3? So we avoid.

Another word: ""QUILT"": Q,U,I,L,T -> I is at position 3? Again, same as GUILT.

Is there a word with I at position 4? Ending with ""IT"": 
  Possible: EXIT? E forbidden.
  UNITY? U,N,I,T,Y -> N forbidden? Yes, from guess1: N absent.
  UNFIT? N forbidden.
  WORST? O and S forbidden? O and S marked absent.

This is difficult. 

Another possibility: I at position 1? ""ITCHY"" -> ends with Y, not T.
""IGLOO"" -> ends with O, forbidden.

What about ""INEPT""? But N and E forbidden? Both absent.

Wait, note: we can use Y? Like ""DAILY"" doesn't end with T. ""MIGHT""? But M and G,H,T: M forbidden? Yes, from guess2: M absent.

Then, let me think of words ending with T and having I at position 1: do any exist? 
  INTRO? N forbidden, and O forbidden.
  INPUT? N forbidden? 
  INSET? N,S,E forbidden.

Not working.

Position 2: _ I _ _ T.
Examples:  LIGHT: L,I,G,H,T -> G and H are allowed? Yes. 
  Positions: I is at position 2? Yes! So pattern: ? I ? ? T
  LIGHT: L at 1, I at 2, G at 3, H at 4, T at 5.

This is a valid word: LIGHT? But we haven't tried L, G, H? They are allowed? Yes.

Could there be others: RIGHT? R forbidden? R is absent.
  BIGHT? B at 1, I at 2, G at 3, H at 4, T at 5 -> valid? BIGHT is a word (it means a bend or coast).
  FIGHT? F,I,G,H,T -> valid.
  DIGIT? G at position 3? D at 1, I at 2, G at 3, I? But duplicate I? Then T? Wait, DIGIT: D-I-G-I-T -> has two I's? The last letter is T? Positions: D(1), I(2), G(3), I(4), T(5). But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback would handle it? However, we are restricted by the letters: but we know I is present? If there are two I's? We don't know. But DIGIT uses I at positions 2 and 4? We don't know if the secret word has duplicates? Possible? But to be safe, let's pick words without duplicates unless necessary.

But note: we haven't tried G, H, L, etc.

A word with I at position 4: _ _ _ I T
Examples: UNLIT? U,N,L,I,T -> N forbidden? Yes.
  UNFIT? N forbidden.
  FLINT? F,L,I,N,T -> N forbidden? Yes.

What about ""DEPTH""? D,E,P,T,H -> E forbidden? Yes.

This is challenging.

Another idea: I at position 1? ""IGAPU""? Not a word.

Or ""TUTTI""? T at both 1 and 5? And U,T? But we end with 'I T'? No.

Perhaps we can pick a word that has I and T (and ends with T) and uses allowed letters, without worrying too much about I's position? But we must place I in position 1,2, or 4? Because position 3 is off-limits for this guess? Actually, no, we can put I in any position (including 3) but since we know it's wrong at position 3, putting it at 3 again would be wasteful? Because it would get a '-' again? And that doesn't give new information about I's position? So we should try a different position.

Therefore, let us try I in position 2? As in LIGHT, BIGHT, DIGIT, etc.?

But DIGIT has two I's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But from the feedback earlier, we haven't encountered duplicates? But the rules don't mention duplicates? We should assume duplicates are possible? But we know the secret word has an I? It might have more? So DIGIT is a possibility? But then the fourth letter is I? So we have I at position 4? Also? Then if we guess DIGIT:
- Duplicate I: which one is marked? The feedback symbol will mark each occurrence? So for DIGIT: D,I,G,I,T.
If the secret word has exactly one I, then the I in position 2 might be marked as '-' and the I at position 4 marked as 'x'? But that would tell us there is only one I? That is good information. But we don't know.

Alternatively, let's pick a word that has only one I? Like ""FIGHT"": F,I,G,H,T -> I at position 2.

Similarly, ""LIGHT"": L,I,G,H,T.

But note: in our previous guess ""moist"", we got T(✓) at position 5. So if we guess ""LIGHT"", the T is at position 5? Good? Yes.

So ""LIGHT"": 
- Letter 1: L
- Letter 2: I
- Letter 3: G
- Letter 4: H
- Letter 5: T

We haven't tried L, G, or H? And they are not forbidden? So it's safe.

Similarly, ""FIGHT"": F, I, G, H, T.

But we don't know which one?

Also note: the secret word might have other letters? The more letters we test, the better? So ""LIGHT"" uses L, I (already known), G, H, T? We already know T and I? So we are testing L, G, H? And placing I at position 2? Which we haven't tried.

Similarly, ""BIGHT"": B, I, G, H, T -> tests B, G, H? And I at 2.

We don't know which letters are more common? But H is fairly common? G also.

I think ""LIGHT"" is a common word? So let's choose that.

But note: the secret word ends with T? Yes. And contains I? Yes. And we avoid position 3 for I? We place I at position 2? So if I is actually in position 2, we will get ✓ for that? Otherwise, '-' or 'x'. 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common letters? G and H? They are both common? So either FIGHT, LIGHT, or BIGHT?

Let me choose ""LIGHT"".

But wait, another possibility: we have not tested D and U? But we can test them later? We have 4 more guesses? We are on guess 3.

Alternatively, to test more letters? We can try a word that doesn't reuse I and T? But we must include T at the end? And we must include I? Because we know I is present? Therefore, we cannot avoid I and T? So we must have at least two letters fixed?

Therefore, good candidate: ""LIGHT""

But let me confirm: Does ""LIGHT"" avoid forbidden letters? 
Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S? L is not in there? G? H? T is present? I is present? So yes.

We are going to guess ""LIGHT"".

But note: we have also considered ""BIGHT"" or ""FIGHT"". However, ""LIGHT"" is a common word? Yes.

So next guess: LIGHT.

<guess>light</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

1. **First guess ""crane""**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → eliminated from consideration.
2. **Second guess ""moist""**: 
   - M, O, S: Absent → eliminated.
   - I: Present but misplaced (wrong position 3) → must appear in word, but not at position 3.
   - T: Correct and in position 5 → secret word **ends with T**.

**Constraints**:
- Secret word ends with **T**.
- Secret word contains **I**, not in position 3.

- Use letters like G, H, L (common, untested).

These are all fairly common in English words.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as \'x\', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.\n Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.\n\n We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that are left. We can consider letters like S, T, B, D, G, H, I, L, O, P, U, etc.\n\n A good second guess should use common letters that we haven\'t tried yet and that are likely to appear in English words.\n\n Some common starting letters we haven\'t used: S, T, L, O, P, I, etc.\n\n We can try a word that includes S, T, and other common letters.\n\n Example words: ""sight"", ""pound"", ""built"", ""stomp"", etc.\n\n However, note that we must avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word with high-frequency letters that are still available.\n\n Consider the word ""SLOTH"": \n   S, L, O, T, H. None of these are in the forbidden set (C,R,A,N,E).\n\n Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" or ""BUILT"" or ""STOMP"".\n\n But note: we want to maximize the information. Using more common letters is better.\n\n Another idea: ""TOILS"" or ""POUCH"" (but POUCH has P, O, U, C, H; but C is forbidden, so no).\n\n We must avoid C, so ""POUCH"" is invalid because of the C.\n\n Let\'s try ""STOMP"": \n   S, T, O, M, P. None of these are forbidden.\n\n But we can also consider ""SHIFT"": S, H, I, F, T. Also acceptable.\n\n However, we might want to use a word that has letters that are more common in 5-letter words.\n\n According to letter frequency in English, after removing C, R, A, N, E, the next most common are: S, T, I, O, L, etc.\n\n So, let\'s choose a word that uses S, T, I, O, and L if possible.\n\n Example: ""TOILS"" -> T, O, I, L, S. All allowed.\n\n Another: ""BUOYS"" -> B, U, O, Y, S. Also allowed.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.\n\n I think ""TOILS"" is a good candidate because it uses T, O, I, L, S, which are common and we haven\'t tried.\n\n Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" (P, I, O, U, S) is also good.\n\n However, we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the rules don\'t say, so we assume no duplicates? Actually, the example didn\'t have duplicates, but the rules don\'t forbid it. However, for the first guess we used 5 distinct and they were all absent, so the secret word must be composed of letters not in {C,R,A,N,E} and possibly with duplicates? But typically in such games, duplicates are allowed but not common. We\'ll assume they are allowed but try to avoid duplicates in our guess to cover more letters.\n\n So, let\'s pick a word with 5 new distinct letters.\n\n I\'ll go with ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S.\n\n But wait, let me check if ""TOILS"" is a valid word: yes, it means tools or utensils, or can be a verb.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""SLIPT"" (an archaic form of slipped) but that might be too obscure. Better to use common words.\n\n Another common word: ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T. This uses M instead of L. But M is also a common letter.\n\n However, we have to avoid E, so ""MOIST"" is acceptable.\n\n Let me compare:\n   ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S\n   ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> same letters except M vs L.\n\n Since we don\'t know, both are fine. I\'ll choose ""MOIST"" because it has M and T which are common.\n\n But note: we are going to get feedback on each position, so the order matters for the feedback.\n\n However, for the second guess, we are more interested in which letters are present.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice.\n\n But wait, we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E. ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T. None of these are forbidden.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""MOIST"".\n\n However, let me think of other options: ""BUILD"" -> B, U, I, L, D. Also good, but we haven\'t covered S and T.\n\n Since S and T are very common, I think including them is better.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""MOIST"".After the first guess ""crane"" received all \'x\' feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word using entirely new letters to maximize information. \n\nConsidering English letter frequency (excluding C/R/A/N/E), common letters like S, T, O, I, L, M, and H are strong candidates. The word **""MOIST""** fits well: \n- Uses 5 new, high-frequency letters (M, O, I, S, T) \n- Covers vowels (O, I) and consonants (M, S, T)  \n- Avoids repeats and forbidden letters  \n\nThis choice will efficiently narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given two previous guesses and their feedback:\n1.

Ends with T (because position 5 is confirmed T).\n2. Includes the letter I, and we should place I in a position that is not 3 (since we know position 3 was wrong). However, note that the \'-\' for I means it must be in the word, so we must include it, and avoid putting it in position 3 again.\n3. Avoids all the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.\n\nWe also know that in the first guess, we tried 5 letters and none were present. In the second guess, we tried M,O,I,S,T. Now M, O, S are absent, leaving only I and T as present (with T fixed at position 5).\n\nTherefore, the word we choose must:\n- Have T at the fifth position.\n- Include I (but not at position 3).\n- Use letters not in the set {C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S}.\n\nWhat letters are available? We can consider the rest of the alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nAlso note, since I is in the word but not in position 3, and we know the position of T (5th), we have to choose positions for I and fill the others with new letters.\n\nWe might prioritize high-frequency letters: among the available, common letters are L, H, D, U, B, G, etc.\n\nStructure of the word: _ _ _ _ T\n\nThe I must go in one of the first four positions, but not position 3. So possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 4.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm words ending with T and containing I, using only the allowed letters.\n\nExamples:\n- With I at position 1: ""IGHT"" words? But we need 5 letters, and the second and third would be filled. However, common words: LIGHT? But L is allowed. LIGHT has L,I,G,H,T -> positions: I at 1? No, L at 1, I at 2. Let me list:\n\nPossible words:\n- I at position 1: \n  - IGUPT? Not a word.\n  - IKHUT? Not valid.\n  It\'s hard. Instead, let me think of words ending with T that have an I and use the allowed letters.\n\nOther examples:\n- BUILT: B,U,I,L,T -> but U and L are allowed? Let\'s see: B,U,I,L,T -> T at end. I is at position 3? We must avoid position 3 for I? Remember: in ""moist"", I was at position 3 and got \'-\', meaning I is in the word but not at position 3. In BUILT, if we put I at position 3, that would be bad? Actually, no: the \'-\' feedback for I in ""moist"" doesn\'t restrict us from trying I at position 3 again? Wait, no: the feedback rules say that the \'-\' means the letter is present but not in that position. So we know I is in the word, so we must include it, but not at position 3 again? Actually, in subsequent guesses, we can try I at position 3 again? But that would be inefficient because we know that position 3 was wrong, so we should avoid putting I there again? The rules don\'t forbid it, but logically we know it\'s incorrect. So we should avoid position 3 for I in our next guess.\n\nTherefore, we must place I in position 1,2 or 4.\n\nWords with I at position 2 and ending with T? Example: PILOT? But O is forbidden (we know O is absent). HILT? Only 4 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\nWith I at position 4: ??\n- The fourth letter is I and last is T: so the pattern: _ _ _ I T. \nExamples: BLITT? Not a word. FLUKE? Doesn\'t end with IT. \nWords ending with ""IT"": like UNIT? But N is forbidden (from guess1). EXIT? E and X: E forbidden, X may be allowed? But E forbidden.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nLet me list common words ending with T and containing I, using allowed letters.\n\nAllowed consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\nVowels: I (we know it\'s present) and other vowels: U, Y? We also know E and A are forbidden, O forbidden.\n\nSo the available vowels are U and Y? And I.\n\nWords:\n- DAILY? Doesn\'t end with T.\n- GUILT: G, U, I, L, T -> ends with T? The word is G-U-I-L-T, so positions: G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), T(5) -> but wait, I is at position 3! And we must avoid position 3 for I? Because in the previous guess, I at position 3 was wrong? But note: the feedback was that I is in the word but not at position 3. Therefore, we want I at a different position. So GUILT has I at position 3? We have to avoid that.\n\nIs there a word with I at position 1? Like IGLOO? No O, and doesn\'t end with T. \nWith I at position 2: \n- BITST? No. \n- PILET? Not a word, and E forbidden.\n- WITTY: W,I,T,T,Y -> but we are ending with T? Actually W-I-T-T-Y: last letter Y? No, ends with Y.\n\nBut note: we don\'t need to avoid T at other positions? In fact, we know T is present only at position 5? But wait, the feedback for T was a \'✓\' at position 5. It doesn\'t say there are no other Ts. However, for now, let\'s assume we don\'t know about other Ts? Actually, the feedback will mark duplicates? But we haven\'t seen any duplicate yet.\n\nGiven the constraints, how about words like:\n- ""GUILT"" has I at position 3 -> skip because we know I should not be at 3? Actually, in ""GUILT"", if the secret word has I elsewhere and not at 3, then guess ""GUILT"" would give I(-) in position 3? But since we know I is in the word, we want to try a position that we haven\'t tried for I? We haven\'t tried positions 1,2,4? Position 4? \n\nWord with I at position 4: ending with ""IT"" -> _ _ _ I T\nExamples: FLUFFY? Not ""IT"". \n  FRUIT? F,R,U,I,T -> F,R,U,I,T: but R is forbidden? Yes, R was in guess1 and marked absent? So no.\n\nHow about ""BUILT"": B,U,I,L,T -> but I is at position 3? So we avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""QUILT"": Q,U,I,L,T -> I is at position 3? Again, same as GUILT.\n\nIs there a word with I at position 4? Ending with ""IT"": \n  Possible: EXIT? E forbidden.\n  UNITY? U,N,I,T,Y -> N forbidden? Yes, from guess1: N absent.\n  UNFIT? N forbidden.\n  WORST? O and S forbidden? O and S marked absent.\n\nThis is difficult. \n\nAnother possibility: I at position 1? ""ITCHY"" -> ends with Y, not T.\n""IGLOO"" -> ends with O, forbidden.\n\nWhat about ""INEPT""? But N and E forbidden? Both absent.\n\nWait, note: we can use Y? Like ""DAILY"" doesn\'t end with T. ""MIGHT""? But M and G,H,T: M forbidden? Yes, from guess2: M absent.\n\nThen, let me think of words ending with T and having I at position 1: do any exist? \n  INTRO? N forbidden, and O forbidden.\n  INPUT? N forbidden? \n  INSET? N,S,E forbidden.\n\nNot working.\n\nPosition 2: _ I _ _ T.\nExamples:  LIGHT: L,I,G,H,T -> G and H are allowed? Yes. \n  Positions: I is at position 2? Yes! So pattern: ? I ? ? T\n  LIGHT: L at 1, I at 2, G at 3, H at 4, T at 5.\n\nThis is a valid word: LIGHT? But we haven\'t tried L, G, H? They are allowed? Yes.\n\nCould there be others: RIGHT? R forbidden? R is absent.\n  BIGHT? B at 1, I at 2, G at 3, H at 4, T at 5 -> valid? BIGHT is a word (it means a bend or coast).\n  FIGHT? F,I,G,H,T -> valid.\n  DIGIT? G at position 3? D at 1, I at 2, G at 3, I? But duplicate I? Then T? Wait, DIGIT: D-I-G-I-T -> has two I\'s? The last letter is T? Positions: D(1), I(2), G(3), I(4), T(5). But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback would handle it? However, we are restricted by the letters: but we know I is present? If there are two I\'s? We don\'t know. But DIGIT uses I at positions 2 and 4? We don\'t know if the secret word has duplicates? Possible? But to be safe, let\'s pick words without duplicates unless necessary.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tried G, H, L, etc.\n\nA word with I at position 4: _ _ _ I T\nExamples: UNLIT? U,N,L,I,T -> N forbidden? Yes.\n  UNFIT? N forbidden.\n  FLINT? F,L,I,N,T -> N forbidden? Yes.\n\nWhat about ""DEPTH""? D,E,P,T,H -> E forbidden? Yes.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nAnother idea: I at position 1? ""IGAPU""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""TUTTI""? T at both 1 and 5? And U,T? But we end with \'I T\'? No.\n\nPerhaps we can pick a word that has I and T (and ends with T) and uses allowed letters, without worrying too much about I\'s position? But we must place I in position 1,2, or 4? Because position 3 is off-limits for this guess? Actually, no, we can put I in any position (including 3) but since we know it\'s wrong at position 3, putting it at 3 again would be wasteful? Because it would get a \'-\' again? And that doesn\'t give new information about I\'s position? So we should try a different position.\n\nTherefore, let us try I in position 2? As in LIGHT, BIGHT, DIGIT, etc.?\n\nBut DIGIT has two I\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But from the feedback earlier, we haven\'t encountered duplicates? But the rules don\'t mention duplicates? We should assume duplicates are possible? But we know the secret word has an I? It might have more? So DIGIT is a possibility? But then the fourth letter is I? So we have I at position 4? Also? Then if we guess DIGIT:\n- Duplicate I: which one is marked? The feedback symbol will mark each occurrence? So for DIGIT: D,I,G,I,T.\nIf the secret word has exactly one I, then the I in position 2 might be marked as \'-\' and the I at position 4 marked as \'x\'? But that would tell us there is only one I? That is good information. But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s pick a word that has only one I? Like ""FIGHT"": F,I,G,H,T -> I at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""LIGHT"": L,I,G,H,T.\n\nBut note: in our previous guess ""moist"", we got T(✓) at position 5. So if we guess ""LIGHT"", the T is at position 5? Good? Yes.\n\nSo ""LIGHT"": \n- Letter 1: L\n- Letter 2: I\n- Letter 3: G\n- Letter 4: H\n- Letter 5: T\n\nWe haven\'t tried L, G, or H? And they are not forbidden? So it\'s safe.\n\nSimilarly, ""FIGHT"": F, I, G, H, T.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one?\n\nAlso note: the secret word might have other letters? The more letters we test, the better? So ""LIGHT"" uses L, I (already known), G, H, T? We already know T and I? So we are testing L, G, H? And placing I at position 2? Which we haven\'t tried.\n\nSimilarly, ""BIGHT"": B, I, G, H, T -> tests B, G, H? And I at 2.\n\nWe don\'t know which letters are more common? But H is fairly common? G also.\n\nI think ""LIGHT"" is a common word? So let\'s choose that.\n\nBut note: the secret word ends with T? Yes. And contains I? Yes. And we avoid position 3 for I? We place I at position 2? So if I is actually in position 2, we will get ✓ for that? Otherwise, \'-\' or \'x\'. \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common letters? G and H? They are both common? So either FIGHT, LIGHT, or BIGHT?\n\nLet me choose ""LIGHT"".\n\nBut wait, another possibility: we have not tested D and U? But we can test them later? We have 4 more guesses? We are on guess 3.\n\nAlternatively, to test more letters? We can try a word that doesn\'t reuse I and T? But we must include T at the end? And we must include I? Because we know I is present? Therefore, we cannot avoid I and T? So we must have at least two letters fixed?\n\nTherefore, good candidate: ""LIGHT""\n\nBut let me confirm: Does ""LIGHT"" avoid forbidden letters? \nForbidden: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S? L is not in there? G? H? T is present? I is present? So yes.\n\nWe are going to guess ""LIGHT"".\n\nBut note: we have also considered ""BIGHT"" or ""FIGHT"". However, ""LIGHT"" is a common word? Yes.\n\nSo next guess: LIGHT.\n\n<guess>light</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n\n1. **First guess ""crane""**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → eliminated from consideration.\n2. **Second guess ""moist""**: \n   - M, O, S: Absent → eliminated.\n   - I: Present but misplaced (wrong position 3) → must appear in word, but not at position 3.\n   - T: Correct and in position 5 → secret word **ends with T**.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- Secret word ends with **T**.\n- Secret word contains **I**, not in position 3.\n- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S.\n- Priority: Test new high-frequency letters (B, D, F, G, H, L, U, etc.) while placing I in untried positions (1, 2, or 4).\n\nIdeal third guess:  \n- Must end with **T**.\n- Must include **I** (avoiding position 3).\n- Use letters like G, H, L (common, untested).  \n- Candidate: **""LIGHT""**  \n  - Ends with T (position 5).  \n  - Places I at position 2 (new position to test).  \n  - Tests new letters: L, G, H (all untested and common).  \n  - Avoids all forbidden letters.\n\nThis maximizes information on letter placements and tests new consonants/vowels.\n\n<guess>light</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(✓)\nGuess 3: light -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) G(✓) H(x) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the feedback for the third guess ""light"":
- L(x): L is not in the word.
- I(✓): I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- G(✓): G is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- H(x): H is not in the word.
- T(✓): T is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word has the second letter I, the third letter G, and the fifth letter T. So the pattern is: _ I G _ T
- Additionally, we know that the first letter is not L and the fourth letter is not H? Actually, H is marked absent, meaning H is not in the word at all? But note: the feedback for H is 'x', which according to the rules means the letter is not in the word. So H is absent.

Also, from previous feedback:
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, L, H (all marked absent in their respective guesses).

Now, we know the word has the form: [letter1] I G [letter4] T

We also know that letter1 and letter4 must be from the remaining available letters, and we must avoid the forbidden letters.

Available letters: We have not tried: B, D, F, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that the word must be a valid English word.

So, we need to fill the first and fourth positions.

The fourth position: what letters can come before T? And the first position: what letters can start a word that has ""IG"" as the second and third letters?

Common words with the pattern _ I G _ T:
- DIGIT: D I G I T -> but we have I at position 2 and 4? But we know I is at position 2? And we don't know if there is another I? But in DIGIT, the fourth letter is I. However, we haven't tried I at position 4? But we know I is in the word? It could be that there is only one I? Or two? But we can try.

But note: in the feedback for ""light"", we have I at position 2 marked correct? So the secret word has I at position 2? Then if we put I at position 4, it might be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, the feedback rules should handle it? But we are trying to guess.

But let's see: if the secret word is DIGIT, then the fourth letter is I? But we have I at position 2? So it would be valid? But we have to check if DIGIT is allowed? It is a word.

But we have forbidden letters? D is not forbidden? So DIGIT: D, I, G, I, T -> D is allowed? I is known, G is known, T is known? And the fourth letter I? But we haven't tested I at position 4? So it could be.

But we also have other possibilities: 
- FIGHT: F I G H T -> but H is absent? We know H is not in the word? So FIGHT is invalid? Because it has H? And we know H is absent? So no.

- LIGHT: we already tried, and L and H are absent? So not.

- MIGHT: M is absent? No.

- NIGHT: N is absent? No.

- RIGHT: R is absent? No.

- TIGHT: T I G H T -> H is absent? And also, T at position 1? But we don't know if T is at position 1? But we know T is at position 5? And we have T at position 1? That would be a duplicate T? But we don't know? However, H is absent? So TIGHT is invalid.

- WIGHT: W I G H T -> H absent? No.

- BIGOT: B I G O T -> O is absent? O is forbidden? So no.

- PIGSTY? Too long? 6 letters? No, 5? P-I-G-S-T -> but S is absent? And the pattern is _ I G _ T? So P I G S T? But S is absent? And also, the fourth letter is S? But we know S is absent? So no.

So what are the possibilities? 
- DIGIT: D I G I T -> but we have I at position 2 and 4? And we know I is at position 2? So the fourth letter is I? But we don't know if that is allowed? But it is a valid word.

- Other words: 
  - BIGHT: B I G H T -> H absent? No.
  - EIGHT: E absent? No.
  - FIGHT: H absent? No.

- What about ""DIGIT"" or ""VIGIL""? But VIGIL ends with L? Not T.

- ""MIGMT""? Not a word.

- ""PIGMY""? Not ending with T.

- ""WIGLET""? W I G L E T -> L and E absent? No.

- ""BIGLY""? B I G L Y -> L absent? And not ending with T.

- ""DIGIT"" seems a strong candidate? But let me check if there are others.

Another word: ""DIGHT""? D I G H T -> H absent? No.

""FJORD""? Doesn't fit pattern.

""JIGOT""? Not a common word? And O? Forbidden? J I G O T -> O forbidden.

""QUIET""? Q U I E T -> E forbidden? And the pattern: second letter I? But third letter is E? Not G? So no.

""GUILD""? G is at position 1? But we need G at position 3? And the pattern is _ I G _ T? So G must be at position 3? So no.

Another idea: ""DIGIT"" is one. What about ""DIGEST""? But that's 6 letters? No, 5? D-I-G-E-S-T? 6 letters? So no.

""DOGIE""? Not ending with T? And O forbidden.

So, perhaps ""DIGIT"" is the only common word? But let me think: is there a word like ""VIGOR""? O forbidden? And not ending with T.

""BIGHEAD""? Too long.

So, we have ""DIGIT"" as a candidate? But note: in ""DIGIT"", the fourth letter is I? And we know I is at position 2? So if the secret word is DIGIT, then we have two I's? But we don't know? It could be.

But we also have to consider that the first letter is D? And we haven't tried D? So we can test it.

But note: we have only two positions unknown: first and fourth? And we know the pattern: _ I G _ T.

We can also consider other letters for the first and fourth positions? For example, the fourth position could be U? Like ""IGGUT""? Not a word.

Or Y? Like ""MAGIC""? Not.

Another word: ""DIGIT"" is the only common word I can think of? But let me search my memory: 
- ""DIGIT"" is one.
- ""FIGHT"" is invalid because of H.
- ""LIGHT"" invalid because of L and H? But we tried LIGHT and it had L and H absent? So not.

But what about ""BIGHT""? B I G H T -> H absent? So no.

""TIGER""? Not ending with T? And E and R forbidden? R is absent? E absent.

""TIGON""? O forbidden? And not ending with T.

So, I think ""DIGIT"" is a good candidate? But we have to be cautious: the fourth letter is I? And we know I is at position 2? So if we guess ""DIGIT"", and if the secret word is DIGIT, then we get all correct? But if not, we get feedback.

But are there other possibilities? For example, the fourth letter could be a different letter? Like ""DIGOT""? Not a word? Or ""DIGUT""? Not.

""WIGAN""? Not ending with T.

So, perhaps we should guess ""DIGIT""? But let me check the feedback we would get if it's not DIGIT? We might get information about the first and fourth positions.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more new letters? But we have to fit the pattern: _ I G _ T.

The first letter: we can try D, B, F, P, W, etc.

The fourth letter: we can try I, U, Y, etc.? But what letters can form a word?

Another word: ""DIGIT"" is the only common one? What about ""DIGHT""? But that has H? And H is absent? So no.

""VIGIA""? Not ending with T.

I think we have to go with ""DIGIT"" or consider that the fourth letter might be a consonant? But in English, words ending with ""G_T"" are often ""IGHT"" but H is absent? So not.

Perhaps ""DIGIT"" is the word? Or ""DOGMA""? Not.

So, I'll guess ""DIGIT"".

But note: in ""DIGIT"", the fourth letter is I? And we are putting I at position 4? We know I is at position 2? So if the secret word has only one I, then the fourth letter I would be marked as absent? Or if it has two I's, then it might be present? But we don't know? But we are going to get feedback.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two new letters? But we have to have I at 2, G at 3, T at 5? So only two positions to fill? And we have to use the available letters.

So, let's guess ""DIGIT"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (marked ""x"").  
  **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E.  
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** →  
  - M, O, S: Absent (x) → Exclude M, O, S.  
  - I: Present but misplaced (-) → I is in the word, **not at position 3**.  
  - T: Correct and in position 5 (✓) → **T is the 5th letter**.  
- **Guess 3: ""light""** →  
  - L: Absent (x) → Exclude L.  
  - I: Correct and in position 2 (✓) → **I is the 2nd letter**.  
  - G: Correct and in position 3 (✓) → **G is the 3rd letter**.  
  - H: Absent (x) → Exclude H.  
  - T: Correct and in position 5 (✓) → Confirms T at position 5.  

### Current Constraints
1. **Known positions**:  
   - Position 2: I  
   - Position 3: G  
   - Position 5: T  
   → Secret word pattern: `[?] I G [?] T`  
2. **Excluded letters** (absent in all guesses): C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, L, H.  
3. **Available letters** (not yet tested): B, D, F, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. **I placement**: I is confirmed at position 2, so it cannot be at position 4 (no duplicates confirmed, but possible).  

### Deductions
- The secret word must be a valid 5-letter word matching `[?] I G [?] T`.  
- The 1st and 4th positions must be filled with letters from the available set (B, D, F, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
- Common English words fitting this pattern:  
  - **DIGIT**: D (1st), I (2nd), G (3rd), I (4th), T (5th).  
    - Uses D (available) and tests I at position 4 (new position).  
    - If correct, solves the puzzle. If incorrect, reveals status of D and I (possible duplicate).  
  - Other rare words (e.g., ""VIGIA"", ""JIGOT"") are invalid due to excluded letters or non-English words.  
- **Why ""DIGIT"" is optimal**:  
  - Tests D (high-frequency consonant) and I at position 4 (new position for I).  
  - If I at position 4 is correct, we solve the puzzle. If absent, we learn about duplicates.  
  - Maximizes information with minimal guesses.  

### Next Guess: DIGIT
<guess>digit</guess>",digit,"We are given the feedback for the third guess ""light"":
- L(x): L is not in the word.
- I(✓): I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- G(✓): G is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- H(x): H is not in the word.
- T(✓): T is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word has the second letter I, the third letter G, and the fifth letter T. So the pattern is: _ I G _ T
- Additionally, we know that the first letter is not L and the fourth letter is not H? Actually, H is marked absent, meaning H is not in the word at all? But note: the feedback for H is 'x', which according to the rules means the letter is not in the word. So H is absent.

Also, from previous feedback:
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, L, H (all marked absent in their respective guesses).

Now, we know the word has the form: [letter1] I G [letter4] T

We also know that letter1 and letter4 must be from the remaining available letters, and we must avoid the forbidden letters.

Available letters: We have not tried: B, D, F, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that the word must be a valid English word.

So, we need to fill the first and fourth positions.

The fourth position: what letters can come before T? And the first position: what letters can start a word that has ""IG"" as the second and third letters?

Common words with the pattern _ I G _ T:
- DIGIT: D I G I T -> but we have I at position 2 and 4? But we know I is at position 2? And we don't know if there is another I? But in DIGIT, the fourth letter is I. However, we haven't tried I at position 4? But we know I is in the word? It could be that there is only one I? Or two? But we can try.

But note: in the feedback for ""light"", we have I at position 2 marked correct? So the secret word has I at position 2? Then if we put I at position 4, it might be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, the feedback rules should handle it? But we are trying to guess.

But let's see: if the secret word is DIGIT, then the fourth letter is I? But we have I at position 2? So it would be valid? But we have to check if DIGIT is allowed? It is a word.

But we have forbidden letters? D is not forbidden? So DIGIT: D, I, G, I, T -> D is allowed? I is known, G is known, T is known? And the fourth letter I? But we haven't tested I at position 4? So it could be.

But we also have other possibilities: 
- FIGHT: F I G H T -> but H is absent? We know H is not in the word? So FIGHT is invalid? Because it has H? And we know H is absent? So no.

- LIGHT: we already tried, and L and H are absent? So not.

- MIGHT: M is absent? No.

- NIGHT: N is absent? No.

- RIGHT: R is absent? No.

- TIGHT: T I G H T -> H is absent? And also, T at position 1? But we don't know if T is at position 1? But we know T is at position 5? And we have T at position 1? That would be a duplicate T? But we don't know? However, H is absent? So TIGHT is invalid.

- WIGHT: W I G H T -> H absent? No.

- BIGOT: B I G O T -> O is absent? O is forbidden? So no.

- PIGSTY? Too long? 6 letters? No, 5? P-I-G-S-T -> but S is absent? And the pattern is _ I G _ T? So P I G S T? But S is absent? And also, the fourth letter is S? But we know S is absent? So no.

So what are the possibilities? 
- DIGIT: D I G I T -> but we have I at position 2 and 4? And we know I is at position 2? So the fourth letter is I? But we don't know if that is allowed? But it is a valid word.

- Other words: 
  - BIGHT: B I G H T -> H absent? No.
  - EIGHT: E absent? No.
  - FIGHT: H absent? No.

- What about ""DIGIT"" or ""VIGIL""? But VIGIL ends with L? Not T.

- ""MIGMT""? Not a word.

- ""PIGMY""? Not ending with T.

- ""WIGLET""? W I G L E T -> L and E absent? No.

- ""BIGLY""? B I G L Y -> L absent? And not ending with T.

- ""DIGIT"" seems a strong candidate? But let me check if there are others.

Another word: ""DIGHT""? D I G H T -> H absent? No.

""FJORD""? Doesn't fit pattern.

""JIGOT""? Not a common word? And O? Forbidden? J I G O T -> O forbidden.

""QUIET""? Q U I E T -> E forbidden? And the pattern: second letter I? But third letter is E? Not G? So no.

""GUILD""? G is at position 1? But we need G at position 3? And the pattern is _ I G _ T? So G must be at position 3? So no.

Another idea: ""DIGIT"" is one. What about ""DIGEST""? But that's 6 letters? No, 5? D-I-G-E-S-T? 6 letters? So no.

""DOGIE""? Not ending with T? And O forbidden.

So, perhaps ""DIGIT"" is the only common word? But let me think: is there a word like ""VIGOR""? O forbidden? And not ending with T.

""BIGHEAD""? Too long.

So, we have ""DIGIT"" as a candidate? But note: in ""DIGIT"", the fourth letter is I? And we know I is at position 2? So if the secret word is DIGIT, then we have two I's? But we don't know? It could be.

But we also have to consider that the first letter is D? And we haven't tried D? So we can test it.

But note: we have only two positions unknown: first and fourth? And we know the pattern: _ I G _ T.

We can also consider other letters for the first and fourth positions? For example, the fourth position could be U? Like ""IGGUT""? Not a word.

Or Y? Like ""MAGIC""? Not.

Another word: ""DIGIT"" is the only common word I can think of? But let me search my memory: 
- ""DIGIT"" is one.
- ""FIGHT"" is invalid because of H.
- ""LIGHT"" invalid because of L and H? But we tried LIGHT and it had L and H absent? So not.

But what about ""BIGHT""? B I G H T -> H absent? So no.

""TIGER""? Not ending with T? And E and R forbidden? R is absent? E absent.

""TIGON""? O forbidden? And not ending with T.

So, I think ""DIGIT"" is a good candidate? But we have to be cautious: the fourth letter is I? And we know I is at position 2? So if we guess ""DIGIT"", and if the secret word is DIGIT, then we get all correct? But if not, we get feedback.

But are there other possibilities? For example, the fourth letter could be a different letter? Like ""DIGOT""? Not a word? Or ""DIGUT""? Not.

""WIGAN""? Not ending with T.

So, perhaps we should guess ""DIGIT""? But let me check the feedback we would get if it's not DIGIT? We might get information about the first and fourth positions.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more new letters? But we have to fit the pattern: _ I G _ T.

The first letter: we can try D, B, F, P, W, etc.

The fourth letter: we can try I, U, Y, etc.? But what letters can form a word?

Another word: ""DIGIT"" is the only common one? What about ""DIGHT""? But that has H? And H is absent? So no.

""VIGIA""? Not ending with T.

I think we have to go with ""DIGIT"" or consider that the fourth letter might be a consonant? But in English, words ending with ""G_T"" are often ""IGHT"" but H is absent? So not.

Perhaps ""DIGIT"" is the word? Or ""DOGMA""? Not.

So, I'll guess ""DIGIT"".

But note: in ""DIGIT"", the fourth letter is I? And we are putting I at position 4? We know I is at position 2? So if the secret word has only one I, then the fourth letter I would be marked as absent? Or if it has two I's, then it might be present? But we don't know? But we are going to get feedback.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two new letters? But we have to have I at 2, G at 3, T at 5? So only two positions to fill? And we have to use the available letters.

So, let's guess ""DIGIT"".
