We are making the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can provide maximum information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

Alright, let me tackle this step by step. We're given the first guess and feedback:

First guess was ""crane"", with feedback:
- C → x (not in the word)
- R → x (not in the word)
- A → - (in the word, but wrong position)
- N → x (not in the word)
- E → x (not in the word)

So, breaking this down:
1. Letters C, R, N, and E are completely absent in the secret word. That means we should avoid using them in future guesses.
2. The letter A is present but not in the second position. Since ""crane"" has A as the third letter and it was marked as wrong position, A must be in the word but somewhere else—possibly positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is confirmed incorrect).

Given that only A is confirmed in the word, our next guess should prioritize:
- Including A in a different position.
- Avoiding C, R, N, E entirely.
- Using other common vowels or consonants to test more possibilities.

Potential approach:
- Since A is the only confirmed letter, try placing it in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 to narrow down.
- Use other high-frequency letters like S, T, L, O, I, etc., to maximize information gain.
- Ensure no reused letters from the first guess’s incorrect set (C,R,N,E).

For example, a word like ""salty"" comes to mind:
- S and T are common; L and Y are reasonable probes.
- Places A in position 2, which wasn’t tested before.
- Avoids C,R,N,E completely.
But... ""salty"" uses S and T—both unverified—and A in position 2. It might yield useful feedback.

Alternatively, ""audio"":
- Uses A in position 1 (new position).
- Includes U, D, I, O—all new letters and vowels to test coverage.
But D might be less common, and we lose testing consonants.

Another option: ""mania"":
- Has A twice? Might not be efficient since duplicates could waste a guess.
Also, it brings back N (from ""crane""), which was marked absent—so we should avoid reusing discarded letters.

Upon reevaluation, ""salty"" seems solid:
- S [position 1]: test a new consonant.
- A [position 2]: try placing A here since the original (position 3) was wrong.
- L, T, Y: new letters with good frequency.

If A were in position 1 or 4-5 instead, this guess would reveal positional data. If the word had no S/L/T/Y, we’d gain negatives too.

So, optimizing for information: ""salty"" covers three new consonants (S,L,T) and a vowel-ending (Y), while shifting A to position 2. Seems effective for narrowing down possibilities.

We have feedback from two guesses:

First Guess: ""crane""
- C (x) -> not in word
- R (x) -> not in word
- A (-) -> in word, wrong position (originally in position 3)
- N (x) -> not in word
- E (x) -> not in word

Second Guess: ""salty""
- S (x) -> not in word
- A (-) -> in word, but still wrong position (now in position 2). This confirms that A is indeed present but was not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from this guess). So A must be in one of positions 1, 4, or 5.
- L (x) -> not in word
- T (-) -> in word, wrong position (was in position 4)
- Y (x) -> not in word

From this, we know:
- Letters that are absent: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y
- Letters that are present: A and T

Since A is in the word but not in position 2 or 3, it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
T is in the word but not in position 4 (since we guessed it in position 4 and got '-', meaning it is elsewhere).

We also know that the word does not contain any of the absent letters.

We should use a new word that:
- Includes A and T (both confirmed present)
- Places A in a new position: either 1, 4, or 5? Actually, we know position 2 and 3 are invalid for A, so we must try one of the other positions. Since we've tried A in position 2 and 3 (first guess was position 3, second was position 2), we can try position 1? Or 4? Or 5?
- Places T in a position other than 4 (since it was wrong there). So T could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Additionally, we should test other common letters that haven't been ruled out. Avoid using C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.

Given that, let's try to form a word with:
- A either at 1, 4, or 5? But we should pick one to test. Since we suspect T is also present, we might combine them.

We must avoid putting A in positions 2 and 3.

Let me consider possible words:

Option 1: Place A at position 1. Then we need T somewhere else (not at 4). For example:
- ""A...T"" pattern? Or others.

But we need a valid word. Also, we can introduce new common letters.

Another idea: Include other vowels since we don't have much vowel information? We know E is out. O, I, U are possibilities.

But we have A already, but we need to place it correctly.

Since T is present and we know it's not at 4, perhaps try putting T at position 1? But if T is at 1, then A must be elsewhere (positions 4 or 5?).

But we also have the freedom to choose the other three letters, which should be from the untested letters (and avoid the absent ones).

Let me try to think of words that have A in position 1 and T in a different position? But that might be restrictive.

Alternatively, put A at position 4 or 5? We haven't tried either.

We should choose a word that maximizes new information, i.e., uses common letters not tested.

Untested common consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

Untested vowels: O, I, U.

Possible word with A and T: How about ""PAINT""? But N is absent from the first guess, so no. Avoid absent letters.

We must avoid C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

So let's form a word that has A and T and three new letters.

Try A in position 1: Words like ""ADOPT"", ""ADMIT"", ""AUDIO"", etc. But we need to check if they fit.

""ADOPT"": A at 1, D new, O new, P new, T at 5? That seems good because T is at 5 (which is a new position for T). Also, no absent letters.

""ADMIT"": M and I are new? But T is at 5? Also good.

But we have to note that we are placing T at position 5, so if T is actually in 5, we'll get ✓ for T. If not, we'll get - or x (but we know T is present, so if not 5, then it must be in another position). Also, A at 1: if actual A is at 1, then ✓, else - or x? But we know A is present so if not at 1, then it would be -.

Alternatively, put A at position 4: For example, ""POINT"" has N which is absent -> invalid. Avoid N. How about ""FIGHT""? F, I, G, H. But T is at position 5? And A is not included? We need to include A.

So word must contain both A and T.

Option: A at position 4. Words like ""CHINA"" has C,H,I,N,A -> C absent, N absent -> invalid.

A at position 5: words like ""MEDIA"" -> M,E,D,I,A -> E is absent -> invalid.

We need a word without the absent letters.

List of absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

So we can use: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, etc.

Possible words:

For A at 1: 
- ""AUDIO"": A(1), U(new), D(new), I(new), O(new). This tests A at 1 and also introduces U,D,I,O. But note: does it have T? No. We must include T because we know T is present. So we need a word with A and T.

Hence, ""AUDIO"" does not include T -> invalid for this purpose.

Similarly, ""ADMIT"": A(1), D(new), M(new), I(new), T(5). This includes T at position 5.

So ""ADMIT"": 
- A in position 1? We haven't checked position 1 for A before.
- T in position 5? Previously we had T in position 4 (in ""salty"") and got wrong position.

So if we use ""ADMIT"", we are trying:
- A at position 1: if ✓ then A is at 1; if - then A is at 4 or 5? (since positions 2 and 3 were already wrong)
- T at position 5: if ✓ then T is at 5; if - then T is at 1,2,3? (we know it's not at 4)

But we don't know if the word has D, M, or I? They might be tested.

Another possibility: ""MANGO"" has A at position 2? But position 2 was already tried and feedback said A was not at position 2? In ""salty"", A was at position 2 and got -, meaning A is in the word but not at 2? Therefore, we cannot put A at 2 again? Actually, we must avoid positions 2 and 3 because we know A isn't there.

So for A, only positions 1,4,5 are possible.

Similarly, for T, we know it's not at position 4? So positions 1,2,3,5 are possible.

So let's commit to ""ADMIT"" as a candidate?

But we could also consider other words with A at other positions.

If A is not at 1, this guess would show a '-' for A at 1. Similarly, T at 5 would either be ✓ or '-'.

So with one guess we can potentially identify the positions of A and T? Or narrow down.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that tests multiple positions.

Another candidate: Place A at position 4? We haven't tested position 4.

For example, ""OPATH"" is not a word. Think of words with A at 4 and T somewhere: ""BOATH"" no. ""MOUTH""? M,O,U,T,H -> T is at position 4? But our feedback for T in ""salty"" was T at position 4 got '-' meaning T is not in position 4? So we must avoid T at position 4? Yes, because the '-' indicates it is present but not at that position. So we cannot put T at position 4 again? Correct.

Therefore, in a new word, T must go to a new position: 1,2,3, or 5.

So for A at 4: word like ""TODAY"": T(1),O(2),D(3),A(4),Y(5). But Y is absent? Y was absent in second guess? ""salty"" got Y(x), so we must avoid Y? So ""TODAY"" has Y -> invalid.

Another: ""GUARD"" -> G,U,A,R,D. But R is absent? From first guess R(x). Invalid.

Perhaps ""FLOAT"" -> F,L,O,A,T. But L is absent? From second guess L(x). So invalid.

So it's tricky to put A at 4.

Similarly, A at 5: Words ending with A? ""PIZZA"" has Z duplicated? Or ""VILLA"" has L absent? Many words ending with A are not common, but ""DATA"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

""MANGA"" has N absent? ""TANGA"" has T,A? But N absent and duplicates? Also, T and A present: T(1),A(2),N(3),G(4),A(5). But we have A in position 2? Which we know is wrong (from ""salty"" A at 2 was marked '-')? But actually, in this word, A is at 2 and 5? We know position 2 is not correct for A? So if we guess a word with A at 2 again, it would be marked '-'. Also, N is absent? And we have only 4 letters? So not good.

Then, A at position 5: ""STAFF"" has S absent? ""KAPUT"" -> K,A,P,U,T. Then A at 2? Which is invalid? Must put A at 5: how about ""OUT AT"" not a word.

Perhaps it is easier to stick with A at position 1? So we form words starting with A that also include T? And avoid absent letters.

""C"" absent? So words like ""ABOUT"" -> A,B,O,U,T. But T must be placed? ""ABOUT"": A(1), B, O, U, T(5). Perfect? T at 5? Also, B, O, U are new.

""ADMIT"", as I thought earlier? Also good.

But let's compare:

- ""ABOUT"": places A at 1 and T at 5? Also, B,O,U are untested.
- ""ADMIT"": places A at 1 and T at 5? Then D,M,I untested.

Either is fine? We can choose one.

But note: In ""ABOUT"", O and U are vowels, which might increase information? But we have no vowel information other than A? E is absent? So O,I,U are possible.

Similarly, ""ADMIT"" has I? Also vowel.

I think both are valid?

But ""ADMIT"" uses M and D? Which are less common? Not sure?

Alternatively, ""AUDIO"" doesn't have T? So invalid? Because T must be in the word? So any guess must include T? Because we know T is present? Correct?

Yes, because we have confirmed letters: A and T must be in the secret word?

Therefore, the new word must include both A and T? Along with three new letters? And avoid the excluded ones.

So ""ADMIT"" is a valid word? A, D, M, I, T? And positions: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), T(5)? 

Yes? And T at 5? Which was not tested? Similarly, A at 1? Which was not tested? Previously we only tested A at positions 2 and 3.

Therefore, I think ""ADMIT"" is a suitable next guess? Because it tests two possible positions for the two known letters? And adds three new letters.

If not, ""ABOUT"" equally fine? ""ABOUT"": A(1), B(2), O(3), U(4), T(5)? Similarly tests A at 1 and T at 5? Also good? And avoids absent letters.

But we also have a T at 5? And we know T is present, so if it is at 5 we get ✓, else? We get '-' for T? Same for A.

Perhaps ""ABOUT"" has more common letters? Or ""ADOPT"" -> A(1), D(2), O(3), P(4), T(5)? Also valid? But not including I? Instead O and P.

I think I'll choose ""ABOUT"" because it uses more vowels? Which might give more information? Not necessary? But O and U might be common.

But we only need to test the presence? Actually, we want to find if there are other vowels? Since E is absent, so secret word may have O,I,U? Or only A?

Therefore, ""ABOUT"" tests O and U? While ""ADMIT"" tests D,M,I? Neither is clearly superior.

Let's go with ""ABOUT""? Or ""ADMIT""?

Perhaps let's think differently: We have also the T position? Previously, T was at 4 and marked '-', so we know T must be at 1,2,3, or5? 

In ""ABOUT"", T is at 5? So we test if T is at 5? Similarly, in ""ADMIT"" T at 5? So same.

But for the other letters, perhaps choosing a word that doesn't force the positions to the edges might be better? Or not.

Another candidate: Place T at a different position? Such as position 1?

Word starting with T? Then A must be at 4 or 5? For example, ""THIEF"" -> E absent? ""TAROT"" -> R absent? ""TULIP"" -> U,L,I,P? Then A? Doesn't include A? Must include A? So if we put T at 1 and A at 4? Words like ""TAXPA""? Not a word? ""TARPA"" not? ""TANKA"" has N absent? ""TABLA"" -> T(1),A(2),B(3),L(4),A(5). But A at 2? We know position 2 is wrong for A? So even if we guess A at 2, it will be '-', but we already know? And L is absent? So invalid? Or ""TARGA"" not?

Therefore, words with T at 1 are difficult? Because for A, if we put at 2,3 we know wrong? Positions 4 or 5? But which words? Like ""TONGA"" has N? Absent? ""TRUDA"" not? It seems hard? So perhaps starting with A is easier? Because we can start with A? And follow by T? Etc.

Thus, starting with A? And T somewhere? So ""ABOUT"" or ""ADMIT"".

Let's choose ""ABOUT""? As I think O? Might be common.

But we must note: we have limited tries? So we need quick information.

So I'll go with ""ABOUT""? 

But we know that A cannot be at 2 and 3? So if ABOUT: A1, then if actual is A1, ✓; else - (if at 4 or 5)? Similarly T5.

So feedback will tell us.

Decision: First, ""ABOUT"" it is.

But let me confirm: A at 1? Position 1? Of ""ABOUT""? It is A at position 1? In a five-letter word, positions: 1: A, 2: B, 3: O, 4: U, 5: T? Right.

Also, letters B,O,U are new? Yes.

So I'll proceed with ""ABOUT"".

But note: we also have T? We are putting T at position 5? Which is new? For T, we tested position 4? So now position 5 might be correct? Or it could be in 1,2,3? But position 1 is occupied by A? So if T were at 1? Our guess at position 1 is A? So conflict? Actually, in the guess, positions are independent? So in secret word? T might be at position 1? Then our guess has A at 1? Then A would not be at 1? So in feedback, A gets '-'? And T gets '-' for position5? Because T is present but elsewhere? So we can infer.

Overall, ""ABOUT"" seems fine? With the risk that if T is at position 5? Or not.

Similarly, we could have tried T at position 2? But then with A at 1? Example ""AT..."", But ""ATOMIC"" too long? ""ATTAR"" has double T? Not efficient? Or ""ATH OD"" no.

So ""ABOUT"" or ""ADMIT"" are reasonable? But let me choose ""ABOUT""?

Alternatively, to test T at a middle position? We might use a word with T at position 2 or 3? But we must include A? So for example, if we put T at position 2? And A at 4? Word like ""G T A"" something? Or "" O T A"" not? "" STOAT"" has S absent? And A at 5? But S is out? ""BOAT"" only 4 letters?

So it's hard? So probably using A at 1 and T at 5? Optimistic? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""ABOUT"".

To avoid placing T and A at positions we aren't sure? We put them in positions that we want to test? Which is exactly what we are doing? So yes.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- Guess 1 (crane): Only ""A"" is present (but not in position 3). Letters C, R, N, E are absent.
- Guess 2 (salty): Confirms ""A"" is **not** in position 2 or 3 (must be in 1, 4, or 5). ""T"" is present but not in position 4. Letters S, L, Y are absent.

Key insights:
1. **Confirmed letters**: A and T must be in the word.
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y (avoid these).
3. **Possible letter positions**: 
   - A can only be in position 1, 4, or 5 (positions 2 and 3 ruled out).
   - T can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (position 4 ruled out in ""salty"").

For the next guess:
- Must test A in a new position (trying position 1 here).
- Must include T (not placing it in position 4, so trying position 5 here).
- Use common new letters (e.g., B, O, U) to maximize information gain.

Chosen word: **ABOUT** (A in position 1, T in position 5). This tests:
- A at position 1: If ✓, A is correctly placed; if -, A is in 4 or 5.
- T at position 5: If ✓, T is correctly placed; if -, T is in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Introduces B, O, U—all untested letters—to probe for presence/positions.

<guess>about</guess>",about,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First Guess: ""crane""
- C (x) -> not in word
- R (x) -> not in word
- A (-) -> in word, wrong position (originally in position 3)
- N (x) -> not in word
- E (x) -> not in word

Second Guess: ""salty""
- S (x) -> not in word
- A (-) -> in word, but still wrong position (now in position 2). This confirms that A is indeed present but was not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from this guess). So A must be in one of positions 1, 4, or 5.
- L (x) -> not in word
- T (-) -> in word, wrong position (was in position 4)
- Y (x) -> not in word

From this, we know:
- Letters that are absent: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y
- Letters that are present: A and T

Since A is in the word but not in position 2 or 3, it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
T is in the word but not in position 4 (since we guessed it in position 4 and got '-', meaning it is elsewhere).

We also know that the word does not contain any of the absent letters.

We should use a new word that:
- Includes A and T (both confirmed present)
- Places A in a new position: either 1, 4, or 5? Actually, we know position 2 and 3 are invalid for A, so we must try one of the other positions. Since we've tried A in position 2 and 3 (first guess was position 3, second was position 2), we can try position 1? Or 4? Or 5?
- Places T in a position other than 4 (since it was wrong there). So T could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Additionally, we should test other common letters that haven't been ruled out. Avoid using C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.

Given that, let's try to form a word with:
- A either at 1, 4, or 5? But we should pick one to test. Since we suspect T is also present, we might combine them.

We must avoid putting A in positions 2 and 3.

Let me consider possible words:

Option 1: Place A at position 1. Then we need T somewhere else (not at 4). For example:
- ""A...T"" pattern? Or others.

But we need a valid word. Also, we can introduce new common letters.

Another idea: Include other vowels since we don't have much vowel information? We know E is out. O, I, U are possibilities.

But we have A already, but we need to place it correctly.

Since T is present and we know it's not at 4, perhaps try putting T at position 1? But if T is at 1, then A must be elsewhere (positions 4 or 5?).

But we also have the freedom to choose the other three letters, which should be from the untested letters (and avoid the absent ones).

Let me try to think of words that have A in position 1 and T in a different position? But that might be restrictive.

Alternatively, put A at position 4 or 5? We haven't tried either.

We should choose a word that maximizes new information, i.e., uses common letters not tested.

Untested common consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

Untested vowels: O, I, U.

Possible word with A and T: How about ""PAINT""? But N is absent from the first guess, so no. Avoid absent letters.

We must avoid C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

So let's form a word that has A and T and three new letters.

Try A in position 1: Words like ""ADOPT"", ""ADMIT"", ""AUDIO"", etc. But we need to check if they fit.

""ADOPT"": A at 1, D new, O new, P new, T at 5? That seems good because T is at 5 (which is a new position for T). Also, no absent letters.

""ADMIT"": M and I are new? But T is at 5? Also good.

But we have to note that we are placing T at position 5, so if T is actually in 5, we'll get ✓ for T. If not, we'll get - or x (but we know T is present, so if not 5, then it must be in another position). Also, A at 1: if actual A is at 1, then ✓, else - or x? But we know A is present so if not at 1, then it would be -.

Alternatively, put A at position 4: For example, ""POINT"" has N which is absent -> invalid. Avoid N. How about ""FIGHT""? F, I, G, H. But T is at position 5? And A is not included? We need to include A.

So word must contain both A and T.

Option: A at position 4. Words like ""CHINA"" has C,H,I,N,A -> C absent, N absent -> invalid.

A at position 5: words like ""MEDIA"" -> M,E,D,I,A -> E is absent -> invalid.

We need a word without the absent letters.

List of absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

So we can use: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, etc.

Possible words:

For A at 1: 
- ""AUDIO"": A(1), U(new), D(new), I(new), O(new). This tests A at 1 and also introduces U,D,I,O. But note: does it have T? No. We must include T because we know T is present. So we need a word with A and T.

Hence, ""AUDIO"" does not include T -> invalid for this purpose.

Similarly, ""ADMIT"": A(1), D(new), M(new), I(new), T(5). This includes T at position 5.

So ""ADMIT"": 
- A in position 1? We haven't checked position 1 for A before.
- T in position 5? Previously we had T in position 4 (in ""salty"") and got wrong position.

So if we use ""ADMIT"", we are trying:
- A at position 1: if ✓ then A is at 1; if - then A is at 4 or 5? (since positions 2 and 3 were already wrong)
- T at position 5: if ✓ then T is at 5; if - then T is at 1,2,3? (we know it's not at 4)

But we don't know if the word has D, M, or I? They might be tested.

Another possibility: ""MANGO"" has A at position 2? But position 2 was already tried and feedback said A was not at position 2? In ""salty"", A was at position 2 and got -, meaning A is in the word but not at 2? Therefore, we cannot put A at 2 again? Actually, we must avoid positions 2 and 3 because we know A isn't there.

So for A, only positions 1,4,5 are possible.

Similarly, for T, we know it's not at position 4? So positions 1,2,3,5 are possible.

So let's commit to ""ADMIT"" as a candidate?

But we could also consider other words with A at other positions.

If A is not at 1, this guess would show a '-' for A at 1. Similarly, T at 5 would either be ✓ or '-'.

So with one guess we can potentially identify the positions of A and T? Or narrow down.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that tests multiple positions.

Another candidate: Place A at position 4? We haven't tested position 4.

For example, ""OPATH"" is not a word. Think of words with A at 4 and T somewhere: ""BOATH"" no. ""MOUTH""? M,O,U,T,H -> T is at position 4? But our feedback for T in ""salty"" was T at position 4 got '-' meaning T is not in position 4? So we must avoid T at position 4? Yes, because the '-' indicates it is present but not at that position. So we cannot put T at position 4 again? Correct.

Therefore, in a new word, T must go to a new position: 1,2,3, or 5.

So for A at 4: word like ""TODAY"": T(1),O(2),D(3),A(4),Y(5). But Y is absent? Y was absent in second guess? ""salty"" got Y(x), so we must avoid Y? So ""TODAY"" has Y -> invalid.

Another: ""GUARD"" -> G,U,A,R,D. But R is absent? From first guess R(x). Invalid.

Perhaps ""FLOAT"" -> F,L,O,A,T. But L is absent? From second guess L(x). So invalid.

So it's tricky to put A at 4.

Similarly, A at 5: Words ending with A? ""PIZZA"" has Z duplicated? Or ""VILLA"" has L absent? Many words ending with A are not common, but ""DATA"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

""MANGA"" has N absent? ""TANGA"" has T,A? But N absent and duplicates? Also, T and A present: T(1),A(2),N(3),G(4),A(5). But we have A in position 2? Which we know is wrong (from ""salty"" A at 2 was marked '-')? But actually, in this word, A is at 2 and 5? We know position 2 is not correct for A? So if we guess a word with A at 2 again, it would be marked '-'. Also, N is absent? And we have only 4 letters? So not good.

Then, A at position 5: ""STAFF"" has S absent? ""KAPUT"" -> K,A,P,U,T. Then A at 2? Which is invalid? Must put A at 5: how about ""OUT AT"" not a word.

Perhaps it is easier to stick with A at position 1? So we form words starting with A that also include T? And avoid absent letters.

""C"" absent? So words like ""ABOUT"" -> A,B,O,U,T. But T must be placed? ""ABOUT"": A(1), B, O, U, T(5). Perfect? T at 5? Also, B, O, U are new.

""ADMIT"", as I thought earlier? Also good.

But let's compare:

- ""ABOUT"": places A at 1 and T at 5? Also, B,O,U are untested.
- ""ADMIT"": places A at 1 and T at 5? Then D,M,I untested.

Either is fine? We can choose one.

But note: In ""ABOUT"", O and U are vowels, which might increase information? But we have no vowel information other than A? E is absent? So O,I,U are possible.

Similarly, ""ADMIT"" has I? Also vowel.

I think both are valid?

But ""ADMIT"" uses M and D? Which are less common? Not sure?

Alternatively, ""AUDIO"" doesn't have T? So invalid? Because T must be in the word? So any guess must include T? Because we know T is present? Correct?

Yes, because we have confirmed letters: A and T must be in the secret word?

Therefore, the new word must include both A and T? Along with three new letters? And avoid the excluded ones.

So ""ADMIT"" is a valid word? A, D, M, I, T? And positions: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), T(5)? 

Yes? And T at 5? Which was not tested? Similarly, A at 1? Which was not tested? Previously we only tested A at positions 2 and 3.

Therefore, I think ""ADMIT"" is a suitable next guess? Because it tests two possible positions for the two known letters? And adds three new letters.

If not, ""ABOUT"" equally fine? ""ABOUT"": A(1), B(2), O(3), U(4), T(5)? Similarly tests A at 1 and T at 5? Also good? And avoids absent letters.

But we also have a T at 5? And we know T is present, so if it is at 5 we get ✓, else? We get '-' for T? Same for A.

Perhaps ""ABOUT"" has more common letters? Or ""ADOPT"" -> A(1), D(2), O(3), P(4), T(5)? Also valid? But not including I? Instead O and P.

I think I'll choose ""ABOUT"" because it uses more vowels? Which might give more information? Not necessary? But O and U might be common.

But we only need to test the presence? Actually, we want to find if there are other vowels? Since E is absent, so secret word may have O,I,U? Or only A?

Therefore, ""ABOUT"" tests O and U? While ""ADMIT"" tests D,M,I? Neither is clearly superior.

Let's go with ""ABOUT""? Or ""ADMIT""?

Perhaps let's think differently: We have also the T position? Previously, T was at 4 and marked '-', so we know T must be at 1,2,3, or5? 

In ""ABOUT"", T is at 5? So we test if T is at 5? Similarly, in ""ADMIT"" T at 5? So same.

But for the other letters, perhaps choosing a word that doesn't force the positions to the edges might be better? Or not.

Another candidate: Place T at a different position? Such as position 1?

Word starting with T? Then A must be at 4 or 5? For example, ""THIEF"" -> E absent? ""TAROT"" -> R absent? ""TULIP"" -> U,L,I,P? Then A? Doesn't include A? Must include A? So if we put T at 1 and A at 4? Words like ""TAXPA""? Not a word? ""TARPA"" not? ""TANKA"" has N absent? ""TABLA"" -> T(1),A(2),B(3),L(4),A(5). But A at 2? We know position 2 is wrong for A? So even if we guess A at 2, it will be '-', but we already know? And L is absent? So invalid? Or ""TARGA"" not?

Therefore, words with T at 1 are difficult? Because for A, if we put at 2,3 we know wrong? Positions 4 or 5? But which words? Like ""TONGA"" has N? Absent? ""TRUDA"" not? It seems hard? So perhaps starting with A is easier? Because we can start with A? And follow by T? Etc.

Thus, starting with A? And T somewhere? So ""ABOUT"" or ""ADMIT"".

Let's choose ""ABOUT""? As I think O? Might be common.

But we must note: we have limited tries? So we need quick information.

So I'll go with ""ABOUT""? 

But we know that A cannot be at 2 and 3? So if ABOUT: A1, then if actual is A1, ✓; else - (if at 4 or 5)? Similarly T5.

So feedback will tell us.

Decision: First, ""ABOUT"" it is.

But let me confirm: A at 1? Position 1? Of ""ABOUT""? It is A at position 1? In a five-letter word, positions: 1: A, 2: B, 3: O, 4: U, 5: T? Right.

Also, letters B,O,U are new? Yes.

So I'll proceed with ""ABOUT"".

But note: we also have T? We are putting T at position 5? Which is new? For T, we tested position 4? So now position 5 might be correct? Or it could be in 1,2,3? But position 1 is occupied by A? So if T were at 1? Our guess at position 1 is A? So conflict? Actually, in the guess, positions are independent? So in secret word? T might be at position 1? Then our guess has A at 1? Then A would not be at 1? So in feedback, A gets '-'? And T gets '-' for position5? Because T is present but elsewhere? So we can infer.

Overall, ""ABOUT"" seems fine? With the risk that if T is at position 5? Or not.

Similarly, we could have tried T at position 2? But then with A at 1? Example ""AT..."", But ""ATOMIC"" too long? ""ATTAR"" has double T? Not efficient? Or ""ATH OD"" no.

So ""ABOUT"" or ""ADMIT"" are reasonable? But let me choose ""ABOUT""?

Alternatively, to test T at a middle position? We might use a word with T at position 2 or 3? But we must include A? So for example, if we put T at position 2? And A at 4? Word like ""G T A"" something? Or "" O T A"" not? "" STOAT"" has S absent? And A at 5? But S is out? ""BOAT"" only 4 letters?

So it's hard? So probably using A at 1 and T at 5? Optimistic? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""ABOUT"".

To avoid placing T and A at positions we aren't sure? We put them in positions that we want to test? Which is exactly what we are doing? So yes.Based on the previous feedback:

- Guess 1 (crane): Only ""A"" is present (but not in position 3). Letters C, R, N, E are absent.
- Guess 2 (salty): Confirms ""A"" is **not** in position 2 or 3 (must be in 1, 4, or 5). ""T"" is present but not in position 4. Letters S, L, Y are absent.

Key insights:
1. **Confirmed letters**: A and T must be in the word.
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y (avoid these).
3. **Possible letter positions**: 
   - A can only be in position 1, 4, or 5 (positions 2 and 3 ruled out).
   - T can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (position 4 ruled out in ""salty"").

For the next guess:
- Must test A in a new position (trying position 1 here).
- Must include T (not placing it in position 4, so trying position 5 here).

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can provide maximum information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let me tackle this step by step. We're given the first guess and feedback:

First guess was ""crane"", with feedback:
- C → x (not in the word)
- R → x (not in the word)
- A → - (in the word, but wrong position)
- N → x (not in the word)
- E → x (not in the word)

So, breaking this down:
1. Letters C, R, N, and E are completely absent in the secret word. That means we should avoid using them in future guesses.
2. The letter A is present but not in the second position. Since ""crane"" has A as the third letter and it was marked as wrong position, A must be in the word but somewhere else—possibly positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is confirmed incorrect).

Given that only A is confirmed in the word, our next guess should prioritize:
- Including A in a different position.
- Avoiding C, R, N, E entirely.
- Using other common vowels or consonants to test more possibilities.

Potential approach:
- Since A is the only confirmed letter, try placing it in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 to narrow down.
- Use other high-frequency letters like S, T, L, O, I, etc., to maximize information gain.
- Ensure no reused letters from the first guess’s incorrect set (C,R,N,E).

For example, a word like ""salty"" comes to mind:
- S and T are common; L and Y are reasonable probes.
- Places A in position 2, which wasn’t tested before.
- Avoids C,R,N,E completely.
But... ""salty"" uses S and T—both unverified—and A in position 2. It might yield useful feedback.

Alternatively, ""audio"":
- Uses A in position 1 (new position).
- Includes U, D, I, O—all new letters and vowels to test coverage.
But D might be less common, and we lose testing consonants.

Another option: ""mania"":
- Has A twice? Might not be efficient since duplicates could waste a guess.
Also, it brings back N (from ""crane""), which was marked absent—so we should avoid reusing discarded letters.

Upon reevaluation, ""salty"" seems solid:
- S [position 1]: test a new consonant.
- A [position 2]: try placing A here since the original (position 3) was wrong.
- L, T, Y: new letters with good frequency.

If A were in position 1 or 4-5 instead, this guess would reveal positional data. If the word had no S/L/T/Y, we’d gain negatives too.

So, optimizing for information: ""salty"" covers three new consonants (S,L,T) and a vowel-ending (Y), while shifting A to position 2. Seems effective for narrowing down possibilities.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- **A** is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
- **C, R, N, E** are NOT in the word, so they should be avoided.  

For the next guess, I need:  
- A word with the letter **A** (since it's confirmed present), but NOT in position 3.  
- No reuse of C, R, N, or E.  
- Prioritize common letters to maximize information gain.  

I choose **""SALTY""**:  
- Places **A** in position 2 (new position, testing the earlier feedback).  
- Uses new high-frequency letters: **S, L, T, Y** (all untested).  
- Avoids C, R, N, E completely.

<guess>salty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First Guess: ""crane""
- C (x) -> not in word
- R (x) -> not in word
- A (-) -> in word, wrong position (originally in position 3)
- N (x) -> not in word
- E (x) -> not in word

Second Guess: ""salty""
- S (x) -> not in word
- A (-) -> in word, but still wrong position (now in position 2). This confirms that A is indeed present but was not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from this guess). So A must be in one of positions 1, 4, or 5.
- L (x) -> not in word
- T (-) -> in word, wrong position (was in position 4)
- Y (x) -> not in word

From this, we know:
- Letters that are absent: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y
- Letters that are present: A and T

Since A is in the word but not in position 2 or 3, it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
T is in the word but not in position 4 (since we guessed it in position 4 and got '-', meaning it is elsewhere).

We also know that the word does not contain any of the absent letters.

We should use a new word that:
- Includes A and T (both confirmed present)
- Places A in a new position: either 1, 4, or 5? Actually, we know position 2 and 3 are invalid for A, so we must try one of the other positions. Since we've tried A in position 2 and 3 (first guess was position 3, second was position 2), we can try position 1? Or 4? Or 5?
- Places T in a position other than 4 (since it was wrong there). So T could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Additionally, we should test other common letters that haven't been ruled out. Avoid using C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.

Given that, let's try to form a word with:
- A either at 1, 4, or 5? But we should pick one to test. Since we suspect T is also present, we might combine them.

We must avoid putting A in positions 2 and 3.

Let me consider possible words:

Option 1: Place A at position 1. Then we need T somewhere else (not at 4). For example:
- ""A...T"" pattern? Or others.

But we need a valid word. Also, we can introduce new common letters.

Another idea: Include other vowels since we don't have much vowel information? We know E is out. O, I, U are possibilities.

But we have A already, but we need to place it correctly.

Since T is present and we know it's not at 4, perhaps try putting T at position 1? But if T is at 1, then A must be elsewhere (positions 4 or 5?).

But we also have the freedom to choose the other three letters, which should be from the untested letters (and avoid the absent ones).

Let me try to think of words that have A in position 1 and T in a different position? But that might be restrictive.

Alternatively, put A at position 4 or 5? We haven't tried either.

We should choose a word that maximizes new information, i.e., uses common letters not tested.

Untested common consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

Untested vowels: O, I, U.

Possible word with A and T: How about ""PAINT""? But N is absent from the first guess, so no. Avoid absent letters.

We must avoid C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

So let's form a word that has A and T and three new letters.

Try A in position 1: Words like ""ADOPT"", ""ADMIT"", ""AUDIO"", etc. But we need to check if they fit.

""ADOPT"": A at 1, D new, O new, P new, T at 5? That seems good because T is at 5 (which is a new position for T). Also, no absent letters.

""ADMIT"": M and I are new? But T is at 5? Also good.

But we have to note that we are placing T at position 5, so if T is actually in 5, we'll get ✓ for T. If not, we'll get - or x (but we know T is present, so if not 5, then it must be in another position). Also, A at 1: if actual A is at 1, then ✓, else - or x? But we know A is present so if not at 1, then it would be -.

Alternatively, put A at position 4: For example, ""POINT"" has N which is absent -> invalid. Avoid N. How about ""FIGHT""? F, I, G, H. But T is at position 5? And A is not included? We need to include A.

So word must contain both A and T.

Option: A at position 4. Words like ""CHINA"" has C,H,I,N,A -> C absent, N absent -> invalid.

A at position 5: words like ""MEDIA"" -> M,E,D,I,A -> E is absent -> invalid.

We need a word without the absent letters.

List of absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

So we can use: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, etc.

Possible words:

For A at 1: 
- ""AUDIO"": A(1), U(new), D(new), I(new), O(new). This tests A at 1 and also introduces U,D,I,O. But note: does it have T? No. We must include T because we know T is present. So we need a word with A and T.

Hence, ""AUDIO"" does not include T -> invalid for this purpose.

Similarly, ""ADMIT"": A(1), D(new), M(new), I(new), T(5). This includes T at position 5.

So ""ADMIT"": 
- A in position 1? We haven't checked position 1 for A before.
- T in position 5? Previously we had T in position 4 (in ""salty"") and got wrong position.

So if we use ""ADMIT"", we are trying:
- A at position 1: if ✓ then A is at 1; if - then A is at 4 or 5? (since positions 2 and 3 were already wrong)
- T at position 5: if ✓ then T is at 5; if - then T is at 1,2,3? (we know it's not at 4)

But we don't know if the word has D, M, or I? They might be tested.

Another possibility: ""MANGO"" has A at position 2? But position 2 was already tried and feedback said A was not at position 2? In ""salty"", A was at position 2 and got -, meaning A is in the word but not at 2? Therefore, we cannot put A at 2 again? Actually, we must avoid positions 2 and 3 because we know A isn't there.

So for A, only positions 1,4,5 are possible.

Similarly, for T, we know it's not at position 4? So positions 1,2,3,5 are possible.

So let's commit to ""ADMIT"" as a candidate?

But we could also consider other words with A at other positions.

If A is not at 1, this guess would show a '-' for A at 1. Similarly, T at 5 would either be ✓ or '-'.

So with one guess we can potentially identify the positions of A and T? Or narrow down.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that tests multiple positions.

Another candidate: Place A at position 4? We haven't tested position 4.

For example, ""OPATH"" is not a word. Think of words with A at 4 and T somewhere: ""BOATH"" no. ""MOUTH""? M,O,U,T,H -> T is at position 4? But our feedback for T in ""salty"" was T at position 4 got '-' meaning T is not in position 4? So we must avoid T at position 4? Yes, because the '-' indicates it is present but not at that position. So we cannot put T at position 4 again? Correct.

Therefore, in a new word, T must go to a new position: 1,2,3, or 5.

So for A at 4: word like ""TODAY"": T(1),O(2),D(3),A(4),Y(5). But Y is absent? Y was absent in second guess? ""salty"" got Y(x), so we must avoid Y? So ""TODAY"" has Y -> invalid.

Another: ""GUARD"" -> G,U,A,R,D. But R is absent? From first guess R(x). Invalid.

Perhaps ""FLOAT"" -> F,L,O,A,T. But L is absent? From second guess L(x). So invalid.

So it's tricky to put A at 4.

Similarly, A at 5: Words ending with A? ""PIZZA"" has Z duplicated? Or ""VILLA"" has L absent? Many words ending with A are not common, but ""DATA"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

""MANGA"" has N absent? ""TANGA"" has T,A? But N absent and duplicates? Also, T and A present: T(1),A(2),N(3),G(4),A(5). But we have A in position 2? Which we know is wrong (from ""salty"" A at 2 was marked '-')? But actually, in this word, A is at 2 and 5? We know position 2 is not correct for A? So if we guess a word with A at 2 again, it would be marked '-'. Also, N is absent? And we have only 4 letters? So not good.

Then, A at position 5: ""STAFF"" has S absent? ""KAPUT"" -> K,A,P,U,T. Then A at 2? Which is invalid? Must put A at 5: how about ""OUT AT"" not a word.

Perhaps it is easier to stick with A at position 1? So we form words starting with A that also include T? And avoid absent letters.

""C"" absent? So words like ""ABOUT"" -> A,B,O,U,T. But T must be placed? ""ABOUT"": A(1), B, O, U, T(5). Perfect? T at 5? Also, B, O, U are new.

""ADMIT"", as I thought earlier? Also good.

But let's compare:

- ""ABOUT"": places A at 1 and T at 5? Also, B,O,U are untested.
- ""ADMIT"": places A at 1 and T at 5? Then D,M,I untested.

Either is fine? We can choose one.

But note: In ""ABOUT"", O and U are vowels, which might increase information? But we have no vowel information other than A? E is absent? So O,I,U are possible.

Similarly, ""ADMIT"" has I? Also vowel.

I think both are valid?

But ""ADMIT"" uses M and D? Which are less common? Not sure?

Alternatively, ""AUDIO"" doesn't have T? So invalid? Because T must be in the word? So any guess must include T? Because we know T is present? Correct?

Yes, because we have confirmed letters: A and T must be in the secret word?

Therefore, the new word must include both A and T? Along with three new letters? And avoid the excluded ones.

So ""ADMIT"" is a valid word? A, D, M, I, T? And positions: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), T(5)? 

Yes? And T at 5? Which was not tested? Similarly, A at 1? Which was not tested? Previously we only tested A at positions 2 and 3.

Therefore, I think ""ADMIT"" is a suitable next guess? Because it tests two possible positions for the two known letters? And adds three new letters.

If not, ""ABOUT"" equally fine? ""ABOUT"": A(1), B(2), O(3), U(4), T(5)? Similarly tests A at 1 and T at 5? Also good? And avoids absent letters.

But we also have a T at 5? And we know T is present, so if it is at 5 we get ✓, else? We get '-' for T? Same for A.

Perhaps ""ABOUT"" has more common letters? Or ""ADOPT"" -> A(1), D(2), O(3), P(4), T(5)? Also valid? But not including I? Instead O and P.

I think I'll choose ""ABOUT"" because it uses more vowels? Which might give more information? Not necessary? But O and U might be common.

But we only need to test the presence? Actually, we want to find if there are other vowels? Since E is absent, so secret word may have O,I,U? Or only A?

Therefore, ""ABOUT"" tests O and U? While ""ADMIT"" tests D,M,I? Neither is clearly superior.

Let's go with ""ABOUT""? Or ""ADMIT""?

Perhaps let's think differently: We have also the T position? Previously, T was at 4 and marked '-', so we know T must be at 1,2,3, or5? 

In ""ABOUT"", T is at 5? So we test if T is at 5? Similarly, in ""ADMIT"" T at 5? So same.

But for the other letters, perhaps choosing a word that doesn't force the positions to the edges might be better? Or not.

Another candidate: Place T at a different position? Such as position 1?

Word starting with T? Then A must be at 4 or 5? For example, ""THIEF"" -> E absent? ""TAROT"" -> R absent? ""TULIP"" -> U,L,I,P? Then A? Doesn't include A? Must include A? So if we put T at 1 and A at 4? Words like ""TAXPA""? Not a word? ""TARPA"" not? ""TANKA"" has N absent? ""TABLA"" -> T(1),A(2),B(3),L(4),A(5). But A at 2? We know position 2 is wrong for A? So even if we guess A at 2, it will be '-', but we already know? And L is absent? So invalid? Or ""TARGA"" not?

Therefore, words with T at 1 are difficult? Because for A, if we put at 2,3 we know wrong? Positions 4 or 5? But which words? Like ""TONGA"" has N? Absent? ""TRUDA"" not? It seems hard? So perhaps starting with A is easier? Because we can start with A? And follow by T? Etc.

Thus, starting with A? And T somewhere? So ""ABOUT"" or ""ADMIT"".

Let's choose ""ABOUT""? As I think O? Might be common.

But we must note: we have limited tries? So we need quick information.

So I'll go with ""ABOUT""? 

But we know that A cannot be at 2 and 3? So if ABOUT: A1, then if actual is A1, ✓; else - (if at 4 or 5)? Similarly T5.

So feedback will tell us.

Decision: First, ""ABOUT"" it is.

But let me confirm: A at 1? Position 1? Of ""ABOUT""? It is A at position 1? In a five-letter word, positions: 1: A, 2: B, 3: O, 4: U, 5: T? Right.

Also, letters B,O,U are new? Yes.

So I'll proceed with ""ABOUT"".

But note: we also have T? We are putting T at position 5? Which is new? For T, we tested position 4? So now position 5 might be correct? Or it could be in 1,2,3? But position 1 is occupied by A? So if T were at 1? Our guess at position 1 is A? So conflict? Actually, in the guess, positions are independent? So in secret word? T might be at position 1? Then our guess has A at 1? Then A would not be at 1? So in feedback, A gets '-'? And T gets '-' for position5? Because T is present but elsewhere? So we can infer.

Overall, ""ABOUT"" seems fine? With the risk that if T is at position 5? Or not.

Similarly, we could have tried T at position 2? But then with A at 1? Example ""AT..."", But ""ATOMIC"" too long? ""ATTAR"" has double T? Not efficient? Or ""ATH OD"" no.

So ""ABOUT"" or ""ADMIT"" are reasonable? But let me choose ""ABOUT""?

Alternatively, to test T at a middle position? We might use a word with T at position 2 or 3? But we must include A? So for example, if we put T at position 2? And A at 4? Word like ""G T A"" something? Or "" O T A"" not? "" STOAT"" has S absent? And A at 5? But S is out? ""BOAT"" only 4 letters?

So it's hard? So probably using A at 1 and T at 5? Optimistic? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""ABOUT"".

To avoid placing T and A at positions we aren't sure? We put them in positions that we want to test? Which is exactly what we are doing? So yes.Based on the previous feedback:

- Guess 1 (crane): Only ""A"" is present (but not in position 3). Letters C, R, N, E are absent.
- Guess 2 (salty): Confirms ""A"" is **not** in position 2 or 3 (must be in 1, 4, or 5). ""T"" is present but not in position 4. Letters S, L, Y are absent.

Key insights:
1. **Confirmed letters**: A and T must be in the word.
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y (avoid these).
3. **Possible letter positions**: 
   - A can only be in position 1, 4, or 5 (positions 2 and 3 ruled out).
   - T can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (position 4 ruled out in ""salty"").

For the next guess:
- Must test A in a new position (trying position 1 here).
- Must include T (not placing it in position 4, so trying position 5 here).
- Use common new letters (e.g., B, O, U) to maximize information gain.

Chosen word: **ABOUT** (A in position 1, T in position 5). This tests:
- A at position 1: If ✓, A is correctly placed; if -, A is in 4 or 5.
- T at position 5: If ✓, T is correctly placed; if -, T is in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Introduces B, O, U—all untested letters—to probe for presence/positions.

This confirms that A is indeed present but was not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from this guess). So A must be in one of positions 1, 4, or 5.\n- L (x) -> not in word\n- T (-) -> in word, wrong position (was in position 4)\n- Y (x) -> not in word\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- Letters that are absent: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y\n- Letters that are present: A and T\n\nSince A is in the word but not in position 2 or 3, it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\nT is in the word but not in position 4 (since we guessed it in position 4 and got \'-\', meaning it is elsewhere).\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain any of the absent letters.\n\nWe should use a new word that:\n- Includes A and T (both confirmed present)\n- Places A in a new position: either 1, 4, or 5? Actually, we know position 2 and 3 are invalid for A, so we must try one of the other positions. Since we\'ve tried A in position 2 and 3 (first guess was position 3, second was position 2), we can try position 1? Or 4? Or 5?\n- Places T in a position other than 4 (since it was wrong there). So T could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nAdditionally, we should test other common letters that haven\'t been ruled out. Avoid using C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.\n\nGiven that, let\'s try to form a word with:\n- A either at 1, 4, or 5? But we should pick one to test. Since we suspect T is also present, we might combine them.\n\nWe must avoid putting A in positions 2 and 3.\n\nLet me consider possible words:\n\nOption 1: Place A at position 1. Then we need T somewhere else (not at 4). For example:\n- ""A...T"" pattern? Or others.\n\nBut we need a valid word. Also, we can introduce new common letters.\n\nAnother idea: Include other vowels since we don\'t have much vowel information? We know E is out. O, I, U are possibilities.\n\nBut we have A already, but we need to place it correctly.\n\nSince T is present and we know it\'s not at 4, perhaps try putting T at position 1? But if T is at 1, then A must be elsewhere (positions 4 or 5?).\n\nBut we also have the freedom to choose the other three letters, which should be from the untested letters (and avoid the absent ones).\n\nLet me try to think of words that have A in position 1 and T in a different position? But that might be restrictive.\n\nAlternatively, put A at position 4 or 5? We haven\'t tried either.\n\nWe should choose a word that maximizes new information, i.e., uses common letters not tested.\n\nUntested common consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.\n\nUntested vowels: O, I, U.\n\nPossible word with A and T: How about ""PAINT""? But N is absent from the first guess, so no. Avoid absent letters.\n\nWe must avoid C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.\n\nSo let\'s form a word that has A and T and three new letters.\n\nTry A in position 1: Words like ""ADOPT"", ""ADMIT"", ""AUDIO"", etc. But we need to check if they fit.\n\n""ADOPT"": A at 1, D new, O new, P new, T at 5? That seems good because T is at 5 (which is a new position for T). Also, no absent letters.\n\n""ADMIT"": M and I are new? But T is at 5? Also good.\n\nBut we have to note that we are placing T at position 5, so if T is actually in 5, we\'ll get ✓ for T. If not, we\'ll get - or x (but we know T is present, so if not 5, then it must be in another position). Also, A at 1: if actual A is at 1, then ✓, else - or x? But we know A is present so if not at 1, then it would be -.\n\nAlternatively, put A at position 4: For example, ""POINT"" has N which is absent -> invalid. Avoid N. How about ""FIGHT""? F, I, G, H. But T is at position 5? And A is not included? We need to include A.\n\nSo word must contain both A and T.\n\nOption: A at position 4. Words like ""CHINA"" has C,H,I,N,A -> C absent, N absent -> invalid.\n\nA at position 5: words like ""MEDIA"" -> M,E,D,I,A -> E is absent -> invalid.\n\nWe need a word without the absent letters.\n\nList of absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.\n\nSo we can use: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\nFor A at 1: \n- ""AUDIO"": A(1), U(new), D(new), I(new), O(new). This tests A at 1 and also introduces U,D,I,O. But note: does it have T? No. We must include T because we know T is present. So we need a word with A and T.\n\nHence, ""AUDIO"" does not include T -> invalid for this purpose.\n\nSimilarly, ""ADMIT"": A(1), D(new), M(new), I(new), T(5). This includes T at position 5.\n\nSo ""ADMIT"": \n- A in position 1? We haven\'t checked position 1 for A before.\n- T in position 5? Previously we had T in position 4 (in ""salty"") and got wrong position.\n\nSo if we use ""ADMIT"", we are trying:\n- A at position 1: if ✓ then A is at 1; if - then A is at 4 or 5? (since positions 2 and 3 were already wrong)\n- T at position 5: if ✓ then T is at 5; if - then T is at 1,2,3? (we know it\'s not at 4)\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has D, M, or I? They might be tested.\n\nAnother possibility: ""MANGO"" has A at position 2? But position 2 was already tried and feedback said A was not at position 2? In ""salty"", A was at position 2 and got -, meaning A is in the word but not at 2? Therefore, we cannot put A at 2 again? Actually, we must avoid positions 2 and 3 because we know A isn\'t there.\n\nSo for A, only positions 1,4,5 are possible.\n\nSimilarly, for T, we know it\'s not at position 4? So positions 1,2,3,5 are possible.\n\nSo let\'s commit to ""ADMIT"" as a candidate?\n\nBut we could also consider other words with A at other positions.\n\nIf A is not at 1, this guess would show a \'-\' for A at 1. Similarly, T at 5 would either be ✓ or \'-\'.\n\nSo with one guess we can potentially identify the positions of A and T? Or narrow down.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that tests multiple positions.\n\nAnother candidate: Place A at position 4? We haven\'t tested position 4.\n\nFor example, ""OPATH"" is not a word. Think of words with A at 4 and T somewhere: ""BOATH"" no. ""MOUTH""? M,O,U,T,H -> T is at position 4? But our feedback for T in ""salty"" was T at position 4 got \'-\' meaning T is not in position 4? So we must avoid T at position 4? Yes, because the \'-\' indicates it is present but not at that position. So we cannot put T at position 4 again? Correct.\n\nTherefore, in a new word, T must go to a new position: 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nSo for A at 4: word like ""TODAY"": T(1),O(2),D(3),A(4),Y(5). But Y is absent? Y was absent in second guess? ""salty"" got Y(x), so we must avoid Y? So ""TODAY"" has Y -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""GUARD"" -> G,U,A,R,D. But R is absent? From first guess R(x). Invalid.\n\nPerhaps ""FLOAT"" -> F,L,O,A,T. But L is absent? From second guess L(x). So invalid.\n\nSo it\'s tricky to put A at 4.\n\nSimilarly, A at 5: Words ending with A? ""PIZZA"" has Z duplicated? Or ""VILLA"" has L absent? Many words ending with A are not common, but ""DATA"" is 4 letters? Not 5.\n\n""MANGA"" has N absent? ""TANGA"" has T,A? But N absent and duplicates? Also, T and A present: T(1),A(2),N(3),G(4),A(5). But we have A in position 2? Which we know is wrong (from ""salty"" A at 2 was marked \'-\')? But actually, in this word, A is at 2 and 5? We know position 2 is not correct for A? So if we guess a word with A at 2 again, it would be marked \'-\'. Also, N is absent? And we have only 4 letters? So not good.\n\nThen, A at position 5: ""STAFF"" has S absent? ""KAPUT"" -> K,A,P,U,T. Then A at 2? Which is invalid? Must put A at 5: how about ""OUT AT"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps it is easier to stick with A at position 1? So we form words starting with A that also include T? And avoid absent letters.\n\n""C"" absent? So words like ""ABOUT"" -> A,B,O,U,T. But T must be placed? ""ABOUT"": A(1), B, O, U, T(5). Perfect? T at 5? Also, B, O, U are new.\n\n""ADMIT"", as I thought earlier? Also good.\n\nBut let\'s compare:\n\n- ""ABOUT"": places A at 1 and T at 5? Also, B,O,U are untested.\n- ""ADMIT"": places A at 1 and T at 5? Then D,M,I untested.\n\nEither is fine? We can choose one.\n\nBut note: In ""ABOUT"", O and U are vowels, which might increase information? But we have no vowel information other than A? E is absent? So O,I,U are possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""ADMIT"" has I? Also vowel.\n\nI think both are valid?\n\nBut ""ADMIT"" uses M and D? Which are less common? Not sure?\n\nAlternatively, ""AUDIO"" doesn\'t have T? So invalid? Because T must be in the word? So any guess must include T? Because we know T is present? Correct?\n\nYes, because we have confirmed letters: A and T must be in the secret word?\n\nTherefore, the new word must include both A and T? Along with three new letters? And avoid the excluded ones.\n\nSo ""ADMIT"" is a valid word? A, D, M, I, T? And positions: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), T(5)? \n\nYes? And T at 5? Which was not tested? Similarly, A at 1? Which was not tested? Previously we only tested A at positions 2 and 3.\n\nTherefore, I think ""ADMIT"" is a suitable next guess? Because it tests two possible positions for the two known letters? And adds three new letters.\n\nIf not, ""ABOUT"" equally fine? ""ABOUT"": A(1), B(2), O(3), U(4), T(5)? Similarly tests A at 1 and T at 5? Also good? And avoids absent letters.\n\nBut we also have a T at 5? And we know T is present, so if it is at 5 we get ✓, else? We get \'-\' for T? Same for A.\n\nPerhaps ""ABOUT"" has more common letters? Or ""ADOPT"" -> A(1), D(2), O(3), P(4), T(5)? Also valid? But not including I? Instead O and P.\n\nI think I\'ll choose ""ABOUT"" because it uses more vowels? Which might give more information? Not necessary? But O and U might be common.\n\nBut we only need to test the presence? Actually, we want to find if there are other vowels? Since E is absent, so secret word may have O,I,U? Or only A?\n\nTherefore, ""ABOUT"" tests O and U? While ""ADMIT"" tests D,M,I? Neither is clearly superior.\n\nLet\'s go with ""ABOUT""? Or ""ADMIT""?\n\nPerhaps let\'s think differently: We have also the T position? Previously, T was at 4 and marked \'-\', so we know T must be at 1,2,3, or5? \n\nIn ""ABOUT"", T is at 5? So we test if T is at 5? Similarly, in ""ADMIT"" T at 5? So same.\n\nBut for the other letters, perhaps choosing a word that doesn\'t force the positions to the edges might be better? Or not.\n\nAnother candidate: Place T at a different position? Such as position 1?\n\nWord starting with T? Then A must be at 4 or 5? For example, ""THIEF"" -> E absent? ""TAROT"" -> R absent? ""TULIP"" -> U,L,I,P? Then A? Doesn\'t include A? Must include A? So if we put T at 1 and A at 4? Words like ""TAXPA""? Not a word? ""TARPA"" not? ""TANKA"" has N absent? ""TABLA"" -> T(1),A(2),B(3),L(4),A(5). But A at 2? We know position 2 is wrong for A? So even if we guess A at 2, it will be \'-\', but we already know? And L is absent? So invalid? Or ""TARGA"" not?\n\nTherefore, words with T at 1 are difficult? Because for A, if we put at 2,3 we know wrong? Positions 4 or 5? But which words? Like ""TONGA"" has N? Absent? ""TRUDA"" not? It seems hard? So perhaps starting with A is easier? Because we can start with A? And follow by T? Etc.\n\nThus, starting with A? And T somewhere? So ""ABOUT"" or ""ADMIT"".\n\nLet\'s choose ""ABOUT""? As I think O? Might be common.\n\nBut we must note: we have limited tries? So we need quick information.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ABOUT""? \n\nBut we know that A cannot be at 2 and 3? So if ABOUT: A1, then if actual is A1, ✓; else - (if at 4 or 5)? Similarly T5.\n\nSo feedback will tell us.\n\nDecision: First, ""ABOUT"" it is.\n\nBut let me confirm: A at 1? Position 1? Of ""ABOUT""? It is A at position 1? In a five-letter word, positions: 1: A, 2: B, 3: O, 4: U, 5: T? Right.\n\nAlso, letters B,O,U are new? Yes.\n\nSo I\'ll proceed with ""ABOUT"".\n\nBut note: we also have T? We are putting T at position 5? Which is new? For T, we tested position 4? So now position 5 might be correct? Or it could be in 1,2,3? But position 1 is occupied by A? So if T were at 1? Our guess at position 1 is A? So conflict? Actually, in the guess, positions are independent? So in secret word? T might be at position 1? Then our guess has A at 1? Then A would not be at 1? So in feedback, A gets \'-\'? And T gets \'-\' for position5? Because T is present but elsewhere? So we can infer.\n\nOverall, ""ABOUT"" seems fine? With the risk that if T is at position 5? Or not.\n\nSimilarly, we could have tried T at position 2? But then with A at 1? Example ""AT..."", But ""ATOMIC"" too long? ""ATTAR"" has double T? Not efficient? Or ""ATH OD"" no.\n\nSo ""ABOUT"" or ""ADMIT"" are reasonable? But let me choose ""ABOUT""?\n\nAlternatively, to test T at a middle position? We might use a word with T at position 2 or 3? But we must include A? So for example, if we put T at position 2? And A at 4? Word like ""G T A"" something? Or "" O T A"" not? "" STOAT"" has S absent? And A at 5? But S is out? ""BOAT"" only 4 letters?\n\nSo it\'s hard? So probably using A at 1 and T at 5? Optimistic? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""ABOUT"".\n\nTo avoid placing T and A at positions we aren\'t sure? We put them in positions that we want to test? Which is exactly what we are doing? So yes.Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- Guess 1 (crane): Only ""A"" is present (but not in position 3). Letters C, R, N, E are absent.\n- Guess 2 (salty): Confirms ""A"" is **not** in position 2 or 3 (must be in 1, 4, or 5). ""T"" is present but not in position 4. Letters S, L, Y are absent.\n\nKey insights:\n1. **Confirmed letters**: A and T must be in the word.\n2. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y (avoid these).\n3. **Possible letter positions**: \n   - A can only be in position 1, 4, or 5 (positions 2 and 3 ruled out).\n   - T can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (position 4 ruled out in ""salty"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must test A in a new position (trying position 1 here).\n- Must include T (not placing it in position 4, so trying position 5 here).\n- Use common new letters (e.g., B, O, U) to maximize information gain.\n\nChosen word: **ABOUT** (A in position 1, T in position 5). This tests:\n- A at position 1: If ✓, A is correctly placed; if -, A is in 4 or 5.\n- T at position 5: If ✓, T is correctly placed; if -, T is in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- Introduces B, O, U—all untested letters—to probe for presence/positions.\n\n<guess>about</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x)\nGuess 3: about -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C (x) -> not in word
- R (x) -> not in word
- A (-) -> in word, wrong position (was position 3)
- N (x) -> not in word
- E (x) -> not in word

Guess 2: ""salty""
- S (x) -> not in word
- A (-) -> in word, wrong position (was position 2; so A not in 2 or 3)
- L (x) -> not in word
- T (-) -> in word, wrong position (was position 4; so T not in 4)
- Y (x) -> not in word

Guess 3: ""about""
- A (✓) -> correct position 1
- B (x) -> not in word
- O (x) -> not in word
- U (x) -> not in word
- T (✓) -> correct position 5

Summary:
- Secret word: _ _ _ _ _ 
  - Position 1: A (confirmed ✓ in ""about"")
  - Position 5: T (confirmed ✓ in ""about"")
- So the word is: A _ _ _ T

Additionally:
- We know A is not in position 2 or 3 (from earlier feedback), and now we know it is in position 1 (so positions 4 and 5 were other possibilities, but position 5 is T).
- T is not in position 4 (from guess 2), and now confirmed at position 5.

We also have absent letters:
- From guess 1: C, R, E, N
- From guess 2: S, L, Y
- From guess 3: B, O, U

So absent letters: B, C, E, L, N, O, R, S, U, Y

Present letters so far: A and T (but both are already placed).

Now, we need to fill positions 2, 3, and 4.

Additionally, we know from guess 1 that A was in the word but not in position 3 (and now we know it's in position 1). No new constraints from that.

But in guess 2, we had T which was not in position 4, and now we know it's in 5. So that constraint is satisfied.

Now, the unknown middle three positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

Available letters: Any letter except the absent ones: B,C,E,L,N,O,R,S,U,Y.

Common letters left: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

We must form a word: A ? ? ? T

We have three positions (2,3,4) to guess.

We don't have any more confirmed letters? All we know is A at 1 and T at 5.

We need to guess the word. Possibilities include words like ""ADAPT"", ""ADMIT"", etc.? But ""ADMIT"" was considered earlier? Let's see.

But we must avoid the absent letters? So we have many options? How to narrow down? Also, from guess 1 and 2, the feedback about A and T? But they are now both placed? So the feedback from guess 1 (""A"" was marked ""-"" in position 3) doesn't impose new constraints? Because now position 1 is correct? And similarly for T? So we are free to choose positions 2,3,4.

So we need to guess? With limited options? Perhaps we can use a word that includes common letters we haven't tested? So maximize information? But since we have three positions? And only three guesses left? But we can use one guess to test several possibilities.

Available letters: We can use D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, etc.

For example, word ""ADMIT"": A,D,M,I,T? Positions: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), T(5). But letters D,M,I are untested? But note: we might have introduced new letters? However, our absent letters are many? But ""ADMIT"" uses D,M,I? All allowed? Because not among absent? So that might work? But we already have A at 1 and T at 5? So feedback would tell about D,M,I? But since we have only unknown positions? Well, if we guess the entire word? We can win? If correct? But likely not? 

Actually, since the pattern is A _ _ _ T? Words: 
- might be ""ADOPT"" -> but O is absent? O is absent? From guess 3? O(x)? So we cannot use O? So ""ADOPT""? Invalid? Because O is not in word? So avoid O? etc.

List valid letters: B,C,E,L,N,O,R,S,U,Y are absent? So we can only use:
D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z (etc.)? But common ones: D, G, H, I, K, M, P.

Possible words: A _ _ _ T? 
- ""ADAPT""? A,D,A,P,T? But double A?
  - Positions: A(1), D(2), A(3), P(4), T(5)? 
  - But the secret word has A only at position 1? Or could have another A? But we don't know? We only know that A is in the word? But not whether duplicate? 
  - So it's possible? But feedback from guess 1 had A as '-' meaning there is at least one A? But not position 3? But if position 3 is A? We cannot know? Unless we test? But in ""crane"", A was guessed in position 3 and got '-' meaning there is an A? But not necessarily only one? So duplicate A is possible? 

Similarly, ""ADMIT"" as above? 

But we must choose? Perhaps start with a word that uses multiple common letters? But we have the constraint of positions 2,3,4.

Common letters: We can try D and I? For example ""ADMIT"" or ""ADIPT"" not a word? Or ""AGIST""? Not common?

Perhaps ""ADMIT"" is a valid word? Yes? But let's see the absent letters? No constraint for D,M,I? So we can use? 

But we might consider other words? To test more vowels? For example, I? Or P? 

Another candidate: ""AIGHT"" not? ""ALIGHT"" has L? Absent? 

""APHID"" -> A,P,H,I,D? Then positions: A(1), P(2), H(3), I(4), D(5)? But position 5 must be T? So we need the last letter T? So it has to end with T? So word is A ? ? ? T? 

Possible English words: 
- ""ADMIT"" : A,D,M,I,T? Valid? Yes? 
- ""ADOPT"" : A,D,O,P,T? But O is absent? Invalid? 
- ""ADAPT"" : A,D,A,P,T? With A at position 3? Which we don't know? Valid? 
- ""AGENT"" : A,G,E,N,T? But E is absent? And N is absent? Invalid? 
- ""AGIST"" : Not valid? 
- ""AWAIT"" : A,W,A,I,T? But W is allowed? Position 4: I? 
  - But we have double A? Also, W and I are new? 
- ""AMBIT"" : A,M,B,I,T? But B is absent? From guess 3? B(x)? So invalid? 
- ""AUDIT"" : A,U,D,I,T? But U is absent? From guess 3? Invalid? 
- ""AVOID"" : A,V,O,I,D? But O absent and U not? Also not ending with T? 

So possible words: 
- ""ADMIT"" : uses D,M,I? 
- ""ADAPT"" : uses D,A,P? But A at position 3? Possible? 
- ""AWAIT"" : uses W,A,I? But A at position 3? 
- ""APHID"" not ending with T? 
- ""AMPLY"" : But Y absent? And not T? 
- ""DWARF"" not starting or ending? 
- ""APISH"" : not ending? 
- ""BAKHT"" not?

Other options? 
  ""ADEPT"" : E absent? 
  ""ADULT"" : U absent? 
  ""AFOOT"" : O absent? 
  ""AFIRE"" : E absent? 
  ""AGAPE"" : E absent? 
  ""AGAVE"" : E absent? 
  ""AGITA"" : ends with A? 
  ""ALIST?"" not?

Then ""AWAIT"" : A,W,A,I,T? But position 5 is T? Positions: A(1), W(2), A(3), I(4), T(5)? 
Valid? Yes? 

Similarly, ""ADAPT"": A,D,A,P,T? Positions: A(1), D(2), A(3), P(4), T(5)? 
But ""ADAPT"" has A at position 3? Which because in guess 1, when we guessed ""crane"" with A at position 3, it was marked '-'? Meaning that if the word has A at position 3, it should have been marked as present? But '-' indicates that A is in the word? However, if the word also has A at 3? We don't know? Because '-' means the letter is present? But not in that position? So in ""crane"" position 3 was A? But marked '-'? That means position 3 is not correct? But A is in the word? So in the secret word, A is at position 1? Therefore, position 3 cannot be A? Because if it were, then it should have been marked as correct? Or no? 

Actually, the rule: 
✓: correct letter and correct position?
-: letter is in the word but wrong position?
x: letter not in the word.

For ""crane"": we have A in position 3? Marked '-'? Meaning the secret word has A? But not at position 3? So if the secret word had A at position 3, then we should have ✓? But we didn't? Therefore, in the secret word, position 3 is NOT A? 

Moreover, now we have confirmed that position 1 is A? So duplicate A might be possible? But not at position 3? Because if it were at 3? Then ""crane"" would have shown ✓ or '-'? Wait! 

When we guessed ""crane"", position 3 was A? And we got '-', meaning:
- The secret word has the letter A somewhere (at least one), but not at position 3. 
- It does not say anything whether there might be other A's? But importantly, it confirms A is not at position 3? Because if it were, it would have been marked ✓? Since now we also have A at position 1? The secret word's position 3 is not A? So if we guess a word with A at position 3? Then that letter position would be marked based on: if the secret word has two A's? Then it might be correct? Or if only one? Then it would be '-'.

But let's revisit the feedback? In ""crane"", we got:
- A: '-', meaning: the secret word has A? But not in position 3? So necessarily, position 3 is not A? Therefore, in any future guess? We cannot put A at position 3? And the secret word does not have A at position 3? 

Moreover, we also have A at position 1? Therefore, the secret word has at least one A? At position 1? So if we put A at position 3? We would be wrong? Because it's already placed at 1? And if there is only one? Then it should be x or '-'. 

But to simplify: the secret word starts with A? Ends with T? And position 3 is not A? 

So valid words: 

- Must have A at 1 and not at 3? 
- T at 5?
- Position 2,3,4: any letters except absent list? And not A? Because if we put A at 2? But guess 2 had A at 2? Marked '-'? So position 2 cannot be A? Similarly, position 3 cannot be? So only possible for A? At position 1? Therefore, the letters at positions 2,3,4 are NOT A? 

Therefore, we can disregard guessing any A for positions 2,3,4? 

So the word pattern: A [not A not absent] [not A not absent] [not A not absent] T? 

So with three positions? And absent letters: B,C,E,L,N,O,R,S,U,Y? And also avoiding A? 

Available letters: D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,V,W etc.? 

Possible words: 
- ""AGENT"": has E,N? absent? Invalid?
- ""ADMIT"": D,M,I? Valid? 
- ""ADAPT"": D,A,P? But A? We concluded positions 2-4 cannot be A? Because A is already at 1? And duplicate? But it could have multiple A? However, if ""ADAPT"" were the word? Then positions: 
  - Position 1: A (correct)
  - Position 2: D
  - Position 3: A? But in ""crane"" we guessed A at position 3? And got '-', meaning that if there is an A at position 3? It should have been marked as present? But not corrected? So '-' is only if it is present elsewhere? But if it were at position 3, then ✓? Thus, for it to be '-', position 3 must not be A? Therefore, secret word does not have A at position 3? Similarly? For any position we guessed? 

So no, the secret word does not have A at position 3? So we must avoid guessing A at position 3? Therefore, words with A at position 3 are invalid? Because impossible? 

Similarly, position 2 cannot be A? Because we tried? 

Therefore, positions 2,3,4 are not A? 

So ""ADAPT"" has A at position 3? Which is not possible? Because secret word does not have A at position 3? Therefore, ""ADAPT"" cannot be? 

Similarly, ""AWAIT"" has A at position 3? So invalid? 

Therefore, we can only use words without A? For positions 2,3,4? 

Now, look for words: A ? ? ? T? 
- Ending with T? 
- Positions 2,3,4: letters not absent? And among available? 

Common words:
- ""ADMIT"": letters D,M,I? All available? Positions: A, D, M, I, T? Also valid word? 
- ""APPLY"": has P,P,L? But L absent? Invalid? 
- ""ADVFT"" not? 
- ""ADMIT"" seems good? 
- ""AGIST"" not valid? 
- ""AMOCT"" not? 
- ""ANKHT"" not? 
- ""APIHT"" not? 
- ""APPDT"" not? 

Another: ""ADHPT""? Not? 

""ADULT"" has U? Absent? 
""AFFIX"" has F? Then X? Not ending T? 
""AGLET""? But G,L,E? Absent? 

""AHINT"" not? 
""AHOLD"" has O? Absent? 

""ADMIT"" appears to be a strong candidate? Or ""ADOPT"" but O absent? 

What about ""ADVEW""? Not? 

""ADZED""? not ending T? 

Perhaps ""ADMIN""? A,D,M,I,N? But N absent? From guess 1? So invalid? 

""ADMIR""? A,D,M,I,R? But R absent? 

Another word: ""ADIPT"" not standard? 

""ADMIT"" is good? 

Also, ""ADWIT""? Not word? 

""AFOOT"" O absent? 

""AFRIT"" has R? Absent? 

""AGITA"" ends with A? 

""AGLET"" L,E absent? 

So let's use ""ADMIT""? 

But we introduced D,M,I? We can get feedback on them? 

Since we have the pattern? There might be other options? 

Such as ""AFIAT""? Not? 

""AMNIA"" has N? Absent? 

""AMPLY"" Y absent? 

""APING"" not ending T? 

Perhaps ""AUDIT"" but U absent? 

Therefore, ""ADMIT"" is a valid English word? So we go with that? 

Therefore, our next guess: ""ADMIT""? 

But it's the first three letters? Of our available choices? 

To be thorough? Let's see if there are other words? 

Another common word: ""AIGHT""? Not? 

""AHEAD"" ends with D? 

""ALIKE"" E,L? 

Nope? So ""ADMIT"" is a candidate? 

Yet another: ""APHID"" not ending T? 

So I think ""ADMIT"" is acceptable? 

Therefore, we guess ""ADMIT""? 

But note: positions? A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), T(5)? 

If correct? We win? Otherwise? Feedback? But we are not done? 

So guess it? 

Alternatively, consider that D,M,I might not? But we don't know? So we test? 

Yes? 

Given we have a guess? Let's proceed.

### Problem Analysis Recap:
- **Secret Word**: Starts with **A** and ends with **T** (confirmed from ""about"" feedback: A(✓) and T(✓)).
- **Absent Letters**: B, C, E, L, N, O, R, S, U, Y (from feedback across guesses).
- **Key Constraints**:
  - Position 1: **A** (fixed).
  - Position 5: **T** (fixed).
  - Positions 2,3,4: Must be letters not in the absent list.
  - Position 3 cannot be **A** (from ""crane"" feedback: A(-) in position 3 was wrong).
  - Position 2 cannot be **A** (from ""salty"" feedback: A(-) in position 2 was wrong).
- **Available Letters**: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W (and other less common letters not explicitly ruled out).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Next Guess:
1. **Word Pattern**: `A _ _ _ T` (5 letters, starting with **A**, ending with **T**).
2. **Focus Positions**: Positions 2, 3, and 4 are unknown and must use available letters.
3. **Goal**: Maximize information by guessing a valid word with common unused letters (e.g., **D**, **M**, **I**).
4. **Validation**:
   - Avoid absent letters (e.g., no **O**, **U**, **B**).
   - Ensure tested letter placements are informative (e.g., position 3 must be probed with a non-**A**).
5. **Candidate Words**:
   - ""ADMIT"" is valid: Uses **D**, **M**, **I** (all untested letters).
   - Positions: 
     - **D** at position 2 (new position).
     - **M** at position 3 (tests a common consonant).
     - **I** at position 4 (tests a vowel that hasn't been used).
   - If incorrect, feedback will clarify which letters are present/absent and their positions.
6. **Why ""ADMIT""?**:
   - Efficiently tests three new letters (D, M, I) across unconfirmed positions.
   - High likelihood of yielding useful feedback to solve the word quickly.
   - Alternative words (e.g., ""ADAPT"") were rejected because they include **A** at position 3 (disallowed) or absent letters.

<guess>admit</guess>",admit,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C (x) -> not in word
- R (x) -> not in word
- A (-) -> in word, wrong position (was position 3)
- N (x) -> not in word
- E (x) -> not in word

Guess 2: ""salty""
- S (x) -> not in word
- A (-) -> in word, wrong position (was position 2; so A not in 2 or 3)
- L (x) -> not in word
- T (-) -> in word, wrong position (was position 4; so T not in 4)
- Y (x) -> not in word

Guess 3: ""about""
- A (✓) -> correct position 1
- B (x) -> not in word
- O (x) -> not in word
- U (x) -> not in word
- T (✓) -> correct position 5

Summary:
- Secret word: _ _ _ _ _ 
  - Position 1: A (confirmed ✓ in ""about"")
  - Position 5: T (confirmed ✓ in ""about"")
- So the word is: A _ _ _ T

Additionally:
- We know A is not in position 2 or 3 (from earlier feedback), and now we know it is in position 1 (so positions 4 and 5 were other possibilities, but position 5 is T).
- T is not in position 4 (from guess 2), and now confirmed at position 5.

We also have absent letters:
- From guess 1: C, R, E, N
- From guess 2: S, L, Y
- From guess 3: B, O, U

So absent letters: B, C, E, L, N, O, R, S, U, Y

Present letters so far: A and T (but both are already placed).

Now, we need to fill positions 2, 3, and 4.

Additionally, we know from guess 1 that A was in the word but not in position 3 (and now we know it's in position 1). No new constraints from that.

But in guess 2, we had T which was not in position 4, and now we know it's in 5. So that constraint is satisfied.

Now, the unknown middle three positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

Available letters: Any letter except the absent ones: B,C,E,L,N,O,R,S,U,Y.

Common letters left: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

We must form a word: A ? ? ? T

We have three positions (2,3,4) to guess.

We don't have any more confirmed letters? All we know is A at 1 and T at 5.

We need to guess the word. Possibilities include words like ""ADAPT"", ""ADMIT"", etc.? But ""ADMIT"" was considered earlier? Let's see.

But we must avoid the absent letters? So we have many options? How to narrow down? Also, from guess 1 and 2, the feedback about A and T? But they are now both placed? So the feedback from guess 1 (""A"" was marked ""-"" in position 3) doesn't impose new constraints? Because now position 1 is correct? And similarly for T? So we are free to choose positions 2,3,4.

So we need to guess? With limited options? Perhaps we can use a word that includes common letters we haven't tested? So maximize information? But since we have three positions? And only three guesses left? But we can use one guess to test several possibilities.

Available letters: We can use D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, etc.

For example, word ""ADMIT"": A,D,M,I,T? Positions: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), T(5). But letters D,M,I are untested? But note: we might have introduced new letters? However, our absent letters are many? But ""ADMIT"" uses D,M,I? All allowed? Because not among absent? So that might work? But we already have A at 1 and T at 5? So feedback would tell about D,M,I? But since we have only unknown positions? Well, if we guess the entire word? We can win? If correct? But likely not? 

Actually, since the pattern is A _ _ _ T? Words: 
- might be ""ADOPT"" -> but O is absent? O is absent? From guess 3? O(x)? So we cannot use O? So ""ADOPT""? Invalid? Because O is not in word? So avoid O? etc.

List valid letters: B,C,E,L,N,O,R,S,U,Y are absent? So we can only use:
D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z (etc.)? But common ones: D, G, H, I, K, M, P.

Possible words: A _ _ _ T? 
- ""ADAPT""? A,D,A,P,T? But double A?
  - Positions: A(1), D(2), A(3), P(4), T(5)? 
  - But the secret word has A only at position 1? Or could have another A? But we don't know? We only know that A is in the word? But not whether duplicate? 
  - So it's possible? But feedback from guess 1 had A as '-' meaning there is at least one A? But not position 3? But if position 3 is A? We cannot know? Unless we test? But in ""crane"", A was guessed in position 3 and got '-' meaning there is an A? But not necessarily only one? So duplicate A is possible? 

Similarly, ""ADMIT"" as above? 

But we must choose? Perhaps start with a word that uses multiple common letters? But we have the constraint of positions 2,3,4.

Common letters: We can try D and I? For example ""ADMIT"" or ""ADIPT"" not a word? Or ""AGIST""? Not common?

Perhaps ""ADMIT"" is a valid word? Yes? But let's see the absent letters? No constraint for D,M,I? So we can use? 

But we might consider other words? To test more vowels? For example, I? Or P? 

Another candidate: ""AIGHT"" not? ""ALIGHT"" has L? Absent? 

""APHID"" -> A,P,H,I,D? Then positions: A(1), P(2), H(3), I(4), D(5)? But position 5 must be T? So we need the last letter T? So it has to end with T? So word is A ? ? ? T? 

Possible English words: 
- ""ADMIT"" : A,D,M,I,T? Valid? Yes? 
- ""ADOPT"" : A,D,O,P,T? But O is absent? Invalid? 
- ""ADAPT"" : A,D,A,P,T? With A at position 3? Which we don't know? Valid? 
- ""AGENT"" : A,G,E,N,T? But E is absent? And N is absent? Invalid? 
- ""AGIST"" : Not valid? 
- ""AWAIT"" : A,W,A,I,T? But W is allowed? Position 4: I? 
  - But we have double A? Also, W and I are new? 
- ""AMBIT"" : A,M,B,I,T? But B is absent? From guess 3? B(x)? So invalid? 
- ""AUDIT"" : A,U,D,I,T? But U is absent? From guess 3? Invalid? 
- ""AVOID"" : A,V,O,I,D? But O absent and U not? Also not ending with T? 

So possible words: 
- ""ADMIT"" : uses D,M,I? 
- ""ADAPT"" : uses D,A,P? But A at position 3? Possible? 
- ""AWAIT"" : uses W,A,I? But A at position 3? 
- ""APHID"" not ending with T? 
- ""AMPLY"" : But Y absent? And not T? 
- ""DWARF"" not starting or ending? 
- ""APISH"" : not ending? 
- ""BAKHT"" not?

Other options? 
  ""ADEPT"" : E absent? 
  ""ADULT"" : U absent? 
  ""AFOOT"" : O absent? 
  ""AFIRE"" : E absent? 
  ""AGAPE"" : E absent? 
  ""AGAVE"" : E absent? 
  ""AGITA"" : ends with A? 
  ""ALIST?"" not?

Then ""AWAIT"" : A,W,A,I,T? But position 5 is T? Positions: A(1), W(2), A(3), I(4), T(5)? 
Valid? Yes? 

Similarly, ""ADAPT"": A,D,A,P,T? Positions: A(1), D(2), A(3), P(4), T(5)? 
But ""ADAPT"" has A at position 3? Which because in guess 1, when we guessed ""crane"" with A at position 3, it was marked '-'? Meaning that if the word has A at position 3, it should have been marked as present? But '-' indicates that A is in the word? However, if the word also has A at 3? We don't know? Because '-' means the letter is present? But not in that position? So in ""crane"" position 3 was A? But marked '-'? That means position 3 is not correct? But A is in the word? So in the secret word, A is at position 1? Therefore, position 3 cannot be A? Because if it were, then it should have been marked as correct? Or no? 

Actually, the rule: 
✓: correct letter and correct position?
-: letter is in the word but wrong position?
x: letter not in the word.

For ""crane"": we have A in position 3? Marked '-'? Meaning the secret word has A? But not at position 3? So if the secret word had A at position 3, then we should have ✓? But we didn't? Therefore, in the secret word, position 3 is NOT A? 

Moreover, now we have confirmed that position 1 is A? So duplicate A might be possible? But not at position 3? Because if it were at 3? Then ""crane"" would have shown ✓ or '-'? Wait! 

When we guessed ""crane"", position 3 was A? And we got '-', meaning:
- The secret word has the letter A somewhere (at least one), but not at position 3. 
- It does not say anything whether there might be other A's? But importantly, it confirms A is not at position 3? Because if it were, it would have been marked ✓? Since now we also have A at position 1? The secret word's position 3 is not A? So if we guess a word with A at position 3? Then that letter position would be marked based on: if the secret word has two A's? Then it might be correct? Or if only one? Then it would be '-'.

But let's revisit the feedback? In ""crane"", we got:
- A: '-', meaning: the secret word has A? But not in position 3? So necessarily, position 3 is not A? Therefore, in any future guess? We cannot put A at position 3? And the secret word does not have A at position 3? 

Moreover, we also have A at position 1? Therefore, the secret word has at least one A? At position 1? So if we put A at position 3? We would be wrong? Because it's already placed at 1? And if there is only one? Then it should be x or '-'. 

But to simplify: the secret word starts with A? Ends with T? And position 3 is not A? 

So valid words: 

- Must have A at 1 and not at 3? 
- T at 5?
- Position 2,3,4: any letters except absent list? And not A? Because if we put A at 2? But guess 2 had A at 2? Marked '-'? So position 2 cannot be A? Similarly, position 3 cannot be? So only possible for A? At position 1? Therefore, the letters at positions 2,3,4 are NOT A? 

Therefore, we can disregard guessing any A for positions 2,3,4? 

So the word pattern: A [not A not absent] [not A not absent] [not A not absent] T? 

So with three positions? And absent letters: B,C,E,L,N,O,R,S,U,Y? And also avoiding A? 

Available letters: D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,V,W etc.? 

Possible words: 
- ""AGENT"": has E,N? absent? Invalid?
- ""ADMIT"": D,M,I? Valid? 
- ""ADAPT"": D,A,P? But A? We concluded positions 2-4 cannot be A? Because A is already at 1? And duplicate? But it could have multiple A? However, if ""ADAPT"" were the word? Then positions: 
  - Position 1: A (correct)
  - Position 2: D
  - Position 3: A? But in ""crane"" we guessed A at position 3? And got '-', meaning that if there is an A at position 3? It should have been marked as present? But not corrected? So '-' is only if it is present elsewhere? But if it were at position 3, then ✓? Thus, for it to be '-', position 3 must not be A? Therefore, secret word does not have A at position 3? Similarly? For any position we guessed? 

So no, the secret word does not have A at position 3? So we must avoid guessing A at position 3? Therefore, words with A at position 3 are invalid? Because impossible? 

Similarly, position 2 cannot be A? Because we tried? 

Therefore, positions 2,3,4 are not A? 

So ""ADAPT"" has A at position 3? Which is not possible? Because secret word does not have A at position 3? Therefore, ""ADAPT"" cannot be? 

Similarly, ""AWAIT"" has A at position 3? So invalid? 

Therefore, we can only use words without A? For positions 2,3,4? 

Now, look for words: A ? ? ? T? 
- Ending with T? 
- Positions 2,3,4: letters not absent? And among available? 

Common words:
- ""ADMIT"": letters D,M,I? All available? Positions: A, D, M, I, T? Also valid word? 
- ""APPLY"": has P,P,L? But L absent? Invalid? 
- ""ADVFT"" not? 
- ""ADMIT"" seems good? 
- ""AGIST"" not valid? 
- ""AMOCT"" not? 
- ""ANKHT"" not? 
- ""APIHT"" not? 
- ""APPDT"" not? 

Another: ""ADHPT""? Not? 

""ADULT"" has U? Absent? 
""AFFIX"" has F? Then X? Not ending T? 
""AGLET""? But G,L,E? Absent? 

""AHINT"" not? 
""AHOLD"" has O? Absent? 

""ADMIT"" appears to be a strong candidate? Or ""ADOPT"" but O absent? 

What about ""ADVEW""? Not? 

""ADZED""? not ending T? 

Perhaps ""ADMIN""? A,D,M,I,N? But N absent? From guess 1? So invalid? 

""ADMIR""? A,D,M,I,R? But R absent? 

Another word: ""ADIPT"" not standard? 

""ADMIT"" is good? 

Also, ""ADWIT""? Not word? 

""AFOOT"" O absent? 

""AFRIT"" has R? Absent? 

""AGITA"" ends with A? 

""AGLET"" L,E absent? 

So let's use ""ADMIT""? 

But we introduced D,M,I? We can get feedback on them? 

Since we have the pattern? There might be other options? 

Such as ""AFIAT""? Not? 

""AMNIA"" has N? Absent? 

""AMPLY"" Y absent? 

""APING"" not ending T? 

Perhaps ""AUDIT"" but U absent? 

Therefore, ""ADMIT"" is a valid English word? So we go with that? 

Therefore, our next guess: ""ADMIT""? 

But it's the first three letters? Of our available choices? 

To be thorough? Let's see if there are other words? 

Another common word: ""AIGHT""? Not? 

""AHEAD"" ends with D? 

""ALIKE"" E,L? 

Nope? So ""ADMIT"" is a candidate? 

Yet another: ""APHID"" not ending T? 

So I think ""ADMIT"" is acceptable? 

Therefore, we guess ""ADMIT""? 

But note: positions? A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), T(5)? 

If correct? We win? Otherwise? Feedback? But we are not done? 

So guess it? 

Alternatively, consider that D,M,I might not? But we don't know? So we test? 

Yes? 

Given we have a guess? Let's proceed.### Problem Analysis Recap:
