We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the 4th letter is N)
 E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the 5th letter is E)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The 4th letter is N.
 - The 5th letter is E.
 - The letters C, R, A are not in the word at all.

 Since the word is 5 letters and ends with ""NE"", we can think of words that have the pattern: _ _ _ N E

 Also, we must avoid using the letters C, R, A.

 We have 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that uses new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that haven't been tried yet. We have used: C, R, A, N, E.

 We know N and E are in the word and in the correct positions, so we don't need to test them again? 
 But note: we are allowed to reuse letters if we think they might appear again? However, in this case, we know:
 - N and E are fixed at positions 4 and 5. So we don't need to change them in the next guess? Actually, we can keep them to confirm and also to test other positions.

 However, the feedback for N and E is already correct, so we can keep them in the same positions to focus on the first three letters.

 So, the next guess should be of the form: _ _ _ N E, and we should avoid C, R, A.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible in the first three positions.

 Let's choose a word that has the pattern: [new1][new2][new3]NE

 We also want to use common letters that are likely to be in the word. Common letters in English: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 Since we have three positions to fill, we can try a word that uses three new common consonants and vowels.

 But note: we have already eliminated C, R, A. So we can use other vowels? The word must have vowels? The known letters are N and E (which is a vowel). So the first three might have more vowels? Or consonants.

 Let's try to think of words ending with ""NE"" that do not contain C, R, A.

 Some possibilities: 
 - STONE: S, T, O, N, E -> but we don't know if O is in the word? We can use this to test S, T, O.
 - SHINE: S, H, I, N, E -> tests S, H, I.
 - PHONE: P, H, O, N, E -> tests P, H, O.

 However, we must make sure that the word is valid.

 We want to maximize information. Let's choose a word that has common letters that we haven't tried.

 We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try to include a mix of vowels and consonants. Vowels we haven't tried: I, O, U (and sometimes Y).

 Let's choose ""SHINE"" because it uses S, H, I (all common) and we avoid the forbidden letters.

 But note: we are not forced to keep the known letters? Actually, we know that the 4th and 5th are fixed? However, the feedback for N and E was correct, so they are definitely in those positions. So we can keep them to get information about the first three.

 Alternatively, we could change the positions of the known letters? But that would be inefficient because we know they are correct at 4 and 5. So we should keep them.

 Therefore, our next guess should be a word that ends with ""NE"" and has three new letters in the first three positions.

 Let's go with ""SHINE"": S in position 1, H in 2, I in 3, N in 4, E in 5.

 But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""SHINE"" is a valid word.

 However, we must consider: what if the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have any evidence of duplicates yet.

 So, I will guess ""SHINE"".

 But wait: what if the word has an 'S'? We don't know. We are testing S, H, I.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has more common consonants? Like ""STONE"" (S, T, O) or ""SLINE"" (but ""SLINE"" is not a common word). 

 Let me check: ""SHINE"" is a common word. So is ""STONE"". 

 Another option: ""SPINE"" (S, P, I). 

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, ... but we have already eliminated A and R, and we know E and N are in.

 So we can try to test T, O, I, S, H, etc.

 I think ""STONE"" is a good candidate because it uses S, T, O (all common) and we avoid the forbidden letters.

 However, note that we have already used the letter 'O'? No, we haven't. We only used C, R, A, N, E.

 So let's compare:

 Option 1: SHINE -> tests S, H, I
 Option 2: STONE -> tests S, T, O

 Which one is better? Both are good. I'll go with ""STONE"" because T and O are very common.

 But note: we have the 4th and 5th fixed, so we are only testing the first three. We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a vowel in the middle because the word might require a vowel in the second or third position.

 Since we don't have any vowels in the first three (we only know the last two), we should test a vowel. The available vowels are I, O, U (and Y). 

 In ""STONE"": O is a vowel in the third position? Actually, positions:
 S (1), T (2), O (3), N (4), E (5)

 In ""SHINE"": S (1), H (2), I (3), N (4), E (5)

 Both have a vowel in the third position.

 I think either is fine. Let's choose ""STONE"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""STONE"" itself? Then we win. But we don't know.

 However, we are just trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat the same letters? We are using new letters.

 I'll go with ""STONE"".

 So the next guess is ""STONE"".

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said that N and E are in the correct positions. So in ""STONE"", we are keeping N and E in the same positions. The first three are S, T, O.

 We are testing S, T, O.

 Let me write the guess: STONE

 However, we must be cautious: what if the word has an 'S'? We don't know. We are about to test.

 So, I think ""STONE"" is a good second guess.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""STONE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are **not** in the word (marked ""x"").
- N is in the correct position (4th letter, marked ""✓"").
- E is in the correct position (5th letter, marked ""✓"").

This means:
1. The secret word has the pattern `_ _ _ N E`.
2. The letters C, R, and A are eliminated.
3. The next guess must be a valid 5-letter word ending with ""NE"" and avoiding C, R, A.

To maximize information about the first three letters, I chose **""STONE""** because:
- It tests three new common letters (S, T, O) in positions 1–3.
- It retains the confirmed ""N"" and ""E"" in positions 4–5.
- ""S"", ""T"", and ""O"" are high-frequency letters in English, increasing the chance of hits.

 Since we don't have any vowels in the first three (we only know the last two), we should test a vowel. The available vowels are I, O, U (and Y). 

 In ""STONE"": O is a vowel in the third position? Actually, positions:
 S (1), T (2), O (3), N (4), E (5)

 In ""SHINE"": S (1), H (2), I (3), N (4), E (5)

 Both have a vowel in the third position.

 I think either is fine. Let's choose ""STONE"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""STONE"" itself? Then we win. But we don't know.

 However, we are just trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat the same letters? We are using new letters.

 I'll go with ""STONE"".

 So the next guess is ""STONE"".

 But note: the feedback for the first guess said that N and E are in the correct positions. So in ""STONE"", we are keeping N and E in the same positions. The first three are S, T, O.

 We are testing S, T, O.

 Let me write the guess: STONE

 However, we must be cautious: what if the word has an 'S'? We don't know. We are about to test.

 So, I think ""STONE"" is a good second guess.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""STONE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are **not** in the word (marked ""x"").
- N is in the correct position (4th letter, marked ""✓"").
- E is in the correct position (5th letter, marked ""✓"").

This means:
1. The secret word has the pattern `_ _ _ N E`.
2. The letters C, R, and A are eliminated.
3. The next guess must be a valid 5-letter word ending with ""NE"" and avoiding C, R, A.

To maximize information about the first three letters, I chose **""STONE""** because:
- It tests three new common letters (S, T, O) in positions 1–3.
- It retains the confirmed ""N"" and ""E"" in positions 4–5.
- ""S"", ""T"", and ""O"" are high-frequency letters in English, increasing the chance of hits.

Or consonants.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words ending with ""NE"" that do not contain C, R, A.\n\n Some possibilities: \n - STONE: S, T, O, N, E -> but we don\'t know if O is in the word? We can use this to test S, T, O.\n - SHINE: S, H, I, N, E -> tests S, H, I.\n - PHONE: P, H, O, N, E -> tests P, H, O.\n\n However, we must make sure that the word is valid.\n\n We want to maximize information.

Vowels we haven\'t tried: I, O, U (and sometimes Y).\n\n Let\'s choose ""SHINE"" because it uses S, H, I (all common) and we avoid the forbidden letters.\n\n But note: we are not forced to keep the known letters? Actually, we know that the 4th and 5th are fixed? However, the feedback for N and E was correct, so they are definitely in those positions. So we can keep them to get information about the first three.\n\n Alternatively, we could change the positions of the known letters? But that would be inefficient because we know they are correct at 4 and 5. So we should keep them.\n\n Therefore, our next guess should be a word that ends with ""NE"" and has three new letters in the first three positions.\n\n Let\'s go with ""SHINE"": S in position 1, H in 2, I in 3, N in 4, E in 5.\n\n But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""SHINE"" is a valid word.\n\n However, we must consider: what if the word has duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any evidence of duplicates yet.\n\n So, I will guess ""SHINE"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has an \'S\'? We don\'t know. We are testing S, H, I.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that has more common consonants? Like ""STONE"" (S, T, O) or ""SLINE"" (but ""SLINE"" is not a common word). \n\n Let me check: ""SHINE"" is a common word. So is ""STONE"". \n\n Another option: ""SPINE"" (S, P, I). \n\n We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, ... but we have already eliminated A and R, and we know E and N are in.\n\n So we can try to test T, O, I, S, H, etc.\n\n I think ""STONE"" is a good candidate because it uses S, T, O (all common) and we avoid the forbidden letters.\n\n However, note that we have already used the letter \'O\'? No, we haven\'t. We only used C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So let\'s compare:\n\n Option 1: SHINE -> tests S, H, I\n Option 2: STONE -> tests S, T, O\n\n Which one is better? Both are good.

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so 4th letter is N)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so 5th letter is E)

Guess 2: ""stone""
- S: ✓ (correct position, so 1st letter is S)
- T: x (not in the word)
- O: ✓ (correct position, so 3rd letter is O)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so 4th letter is N)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so 5th letter is E)

Therefore, we know:
- The word is S _ O N E (since 1st: S, 3rd: O, 4th: N, 5th: E).
- The missing letter is the 2nd letter.
- We have eliminated the letters: C, R, A, T (from the ""x"" in both guesses).

We also know that the 2nd letter must be a letter that hasn't been used yet and is not in the eliminated set.

Letters we have used so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O.

Eliminated letters: C, R, A, T.

Note: N, E, S, O are in the word but we know their positions.

So the word is: S [unknown] O N E

The unknown letter (2nd position) must be a letter that is:
- Not C, R, A, T (since these are eliminated)
- And not any of the already placed letters? Actually, it could be a duplicate? But we don't have any duplicates so far. However, we cannot rule out duplicates, but since we haven't seen any, we might assume it's a new letter.

But note: the feedback for ""stone"" showed that T is not in the word, so T is eliminated.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form S _ O N E.

What are possible words?
- The second letter can be a vowel or consonant, but it must form a valid English word.

Let's think of common words that fit S _ O N E:

Possible options:
- SHONE: H is the second letter. H hasn't been tried yet? In our previous guesses, we haven't used H.
- STONE: but we already tried ""stone"" and the T was marked as not in the word, so T is eliminated. Therefore, ""stone"" is not the word because T is not in the word and it was in the second position? Actually, in ""stone"", the second letter is T and it was marked 'x', meaning T is not in the word at all. So the word cannot be ""stone"".

Other possibilities:
- SCONE? But C is eliminated (from first guess: C is x). So no.
- SRONE? Not a word, and R is eliminated.
- SAONE? Not a word, and A is eliminated.

So, what about SHONE? That seems a valid word.

Are there others?
- SWONE? Not a word.
- SZONE? Not a word.
- SBONE? ""Sbone"" is not a word, but ""B"" is not eliminated? However, we need a valid word. ""Bone"" is a word, but S BONE? That would be ""sbone"", which is not a word.

Wait, what about ""SHONE""? That is the past tense of shine.

Another one: ""SHINE"" but that is S H I N E, but we know the third letter must be O, not I. So no.

What about ""SIONE""? Not a word.

Or ""SOWNE""? Not a word.

So, the only common word I can think of is ""SHONE"".

But let me confirm: 
- S H O N E -> SHONE.

We haven't used H yet, and H is not eliminated.

Therefore, the word must be ""SHONE"".

But wait, we have to make sure that H is not eliminated. In the feedback, we have only eliminated C, R, A, T. H is new.

So, we can guess ""SHONE"".

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have a strong candidate.

Alternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we already know the pattern: S _ O N E, and the only common word is SHONE. There might be others? Let me think.

Another word: ""SMOKE""? But that would be S M O K E, but the fourth letter is K, not N. We know the fourth letter is N.

Or ""SCOPE""? But C is eliminated and the fourth letter is P, not N.

What about ""SHOLE""? Not a common word.

Or ""SHOTE""? But T is eliminated.

So, I think ""SHONE"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we should guess ""SHONE"".

But to be thorough, let's see if there are any other possibilities:

- ""SHOWN""? But that is S H O W N, which would be 5 letters, but then the fifth letter is N, but we know the fifth letter is E. So no.

- ""SHORE""? But R is eliminated and the fifth letter is E? No, SHORE ends with E? S H O R E -> but R is eliminated and the fourth letter is R, but we need N in the fourth. So no.

- ""SHOJE""? Not a word.

So, I think ""SHONE"" is the only reasonable guess.

Therefore, we'll go with ""SHONE"".

But note: we are not 100% sure because there might be uncommon words? But the game typically uses common words.

Alternatively, we could use this guess to test more letters? But we have only one unknown position, so we can solve it.

We have 6 guesses, so we can afford to guess ""SHONE"". If it's not correct, we get feedback on H.

But I think it's the word.

So, the next guess is ""SHONE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Eliminated letters: C, R, A (not in the word). Confirmed: N (4th position ✓), E (5th position ✓).
- **Guess 2: STONE** → Confirmed: S (1st position ✓), O (3rd position ✓), N (4th position ✓), E (5th position ✓). Eliminated: T (not in the word).

### Key Insights:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: **S _ O N E** (1st: S, 3rd: O, 4th: N, 5th: E).
2. Only the **2nd letter** is unknown.
3. Eliminated letters: **C, R, A, T** (cannot appear in the word).
4. The 2nd letter must be a valid English letter not in the eliminated set, forming a real 5-letter word.

### Analysis:
- The only common English word fitting the pattern **S _ O N E** is **SHONE** (past tense of ""shine"").
- **H** is untested and not eliminated, making it a strong candidate for the 2nd position.
- Other possibilities (e.g., ""SIONE"", ""SOWNE"") are invalid words. ""STONE"" is ruled out (T is eliminated), and ""SCONE"" is invalid (C is eliminated).

### Conclusion:
Given the pattern and eliminated letters, **SHONE** is the most probable solution. Guessing it now maximizes efficiency, as it either solves the puzzle or provides definitive feedback on the 2nd letter.
