We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the frequency of letters in English 5-letter words.
 According to various sources, the most common letters in English words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 I want a word that covers several common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E — which are all common letters.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

We are given the feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
 C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is present in the secret word but in the wrong position (so the secret word has a 'C' somewhere not at the start).
 - R is not in the word at all.
 - A is not in the word at all.
 - N is present but in the wrong position (so secret word has an 'N' somewhere, but not in the fourth position).
 - E is not in the word.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters: C and N (but not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"").
 - The secret word does not contain: R, A, E.

 Also, note that the secret word does not have:
 - A first letter 'C' (since if it were correct it would be 'C(✓)', but we got 'C(-)'), meaning C is present but not at the start.
 - Similarly, the fourth letter is not 'N', but N is present elsewhere.

 Let me think about the positions:
 - The secret word has 5 letters.
 - The first letter cannot be C? Actually, the feedback for C is '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the first position. So C must be in positions 2,3,4, or 5? But wait, since our guess had C at position 1 and it's marked '-' that just means position 1 is not C. But C is somewhere else.

 But note: the feedback does not tell us where else C might be, just that it is in the word but not at position 1.

 Similarly, for N: it was at position 4 in our guess, but it must be in the word at a different position (one of 1,2,3,5).

 We also know the absence of R, A, and E.

 Now, we need to make a new guess that:
 1. Is a valid 5-letter English word.
 2. Contains the letters C and N (since they are in the secret word) and avoids R, A, E.
 3. Does not put C at the start (since we know that's wrong) and does not put N at the fourth position.

 Additionally, we can try to cover other common letters.

 Let me think of words that have C and N and avoid A, E, R.

 Common letters left: We can use other vowels? The word must have vowels. The vowels we haven't tried are: O, U, I, and sometimes Y.

 So possible letters to consider: O, U, I, and consonants like L, T, S, etc.

 I am considering a word that has C and N and uses other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - We can try to put C in positions 2-5 and N in positions 1,2,3, or 5.

 Example words:
 - Since we know C cannot be first, we can try words that start with a different letter.

 Let me think:
 Option 1: Start with another vowel? e.g., ""O"" or ""I""
 - Words with O: ""ONION"" -> but has O twice and no C? Doesn't have C.
 - Words with U: ""UNCLE"" -> U, N, C, L, E -> but E is forbidden (we know E is not in the word). So discard.

 Let me avoid letters we know are absent: R, A, E.

 Also, we must include C and N.

 Another idea: ""CLINT"" -> but we have R, A, E absent? C in first position? We know C cannot be first? Actually, our guess ""crane"" had C at position 1 and it was '-' meaning the first letter of the secret word isn't C. So we must avoid putting C at position 1 again.

 So ""CLINT"" has C at the start -> not allowed.

 How about ""CONIC""? -> C is at the start, so not allowed.

 Another word: ""SCION"" -> S,C,I,O,N.
 - Check: S (position 1), C (position 2), I (position 3), O (position 4), N (position 5).
 - This word has C at position 2 and N at position 5 (which is not position 4 as in the previous guess, so that's good).
 - Letters: S, C, I, O, N. None of R, A, E.

 But wait: We don't have any information about these other letters (S, I, O). They could be in the word or not.

 Another possibility: ""MUSIC"" -> but has U, S, I, C. Also, M? And note: N is missing? We must include N. So ""MUSIC"" doesn't have N.

 We must have both C and N.

 Another candidate: ""NICOL"" -> N at position 1? Then I, C, O, L. But note: we don't know if N can be at position 1? Yes, because in the previous guess N was at position 4 and was wrong, but it can be at position 1.

 However, we also have to consider: the feedback told us that C is in the word (but not at position 1) and N is in the word (but not at position 4). So N at position 1 is acceptable.

 But let me spell ""NICOL"": Is that a word? I think of ""Nicol"" as a name? But we need a valid English word. Alternatively, ""NICOL"" might not be common.

 Instead, what about ""CONCH""? Again, C is first -> not allowed.

 Another word: ""INCOG"" -> not a word.

 Alternatively: ""SCONE"" -> S,C,O,N,E -> but E is forbidden. So no.

 What about ""SONIC""? S,O,N,I,C -> 
 - Letters: S, O, N, I, C -> includes N and C, and avoids R, A, E.
 - Positions: 
   - S at 1 -> not C at start
   - C at the end (position 5) -> so that's a different position from before (we had C at 1 and N at 4, now C at 5 and N at 3).
 - This word seems promising.

 But note: the secret word has C and N, so ""SONIC"" includes both.

 How about ""SCORN""? -> has R which is absent? R is forbidden because feedback said R is not in the word. So avoid R.

 What about ""CLINK""? -> C at start? No, we cannot have C at the start.

 How about ""ONCET""? Not common.

 Alternatively: ""OUNCE"" -> contains E -> forbidden.

 Another word: ""MINCE"" -> contains E -> forbidden.

 What about ""LUNCH"" -> contains U and H? But also L, U, N, C, H -> no A, E, R? Yes. And N at position 3, C at position 4? Also, we have C not at the start? L starts, so OK.

 But wait: does ""LUNCH"" have a letter that we know is absent? We know R, A, E are absent. U is not in the known absent list? Actually we don't know about U. So it's possible.

 How about ""CUNTS""? -> C at start -> not allowed.

 Alternatively: ""PINCH"" -> P, I, N, C, H -> doesn't have R, A, E. And C is at position 4? and N at 3? And no C at start? P is at start.

 So ""PINCH"" could be a candidate.

 Similarly: ""WINCH"", ""BENCH"" -> but BENCH has E -> forbidden.

 So candidates: 
 1. SONIC: S, O, N, I, C -> positions: S1, O2, N3, I4, C5.
 2. PINCH: P1, I2, N3, C4, H5.

 But note: we also know that in the secret word N cannot be at position 4? Actually, no: we only know from the previous guess that position 4 was N and it was marked as '-' meaning N is in the word but not at position 4. So position 4 cannot be N. However, in our new guesses, that rule only applies to the secret word's positions? We are free to guess any word? Actually, we are guessing and then we'll get feedback. But we want to maximize information.

 However, we must include C and N and avoid R, A, E.

 Given that, I'll choose ""SONIC"" because it also covers more common letters: S, O, I.

 Alternatively, we can think of a word that doesn't have C at start and doesn't have N at position 4? Both candidates satisfy.

 Let me list more words? 
 - ""STOIC"" -> S,T,O,I,C -> T is acceptable? No R,A,E? But N is missing? Must include N. So discard.

 We must include N.

 Another: ""CONKS"" -> C at start? -> not allowed.

 How about ""NICKS"" -> N at start? -> acceptable. Letters: N, I, C, K, S -> no R,A,E? And C is at position 3? But we don't know if N can be at position 1? It could be.

 But note: in the secret word, we don't have R, A, E. Also, our goal is to find words that help us locate C and N.

 I think ""SONIC"" works because:
 - S at position 1: we haven't tested S before.
 - O at position 2: new letter.
 - N at position 3: we know N is in the word but not at position 4? This is position 3 so it might be correct? We don't know.
 - I at position 4: new letter.
 - C at position 5: we know C is in the word and isn't at position 1? So at position 5? It could be.

 So, let's go with ""SONIC"".

 Therefore, my second guess is ""sonic"".

<guess>sonic</guess>

After evaluating the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (`C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)`), we know the secret word contains **C** and **N** (but **C cannot be at position 1** and **N cannot be at position 4**) and excludes **R, A, and E**. 

For the next guess:
- Must include **C** and **N** while avoiding R, A, E.
- C should not be in position 1.
- N should not be in position 4.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, O, I) to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **""SONIC""**:
- **S** at position 1 (untested position/letter).
- **O** at position 2 (new vowel).
- **N** at position 3 (avoids position 4).
- **I** at position 4 (new vowel).
- **C** at position 5 (avoids position 1).

This adheres to the feedback constraints and efficiently probes new letters/positions.

 I want a word that covers several common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E — which are all common letters.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
 C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is present in the secret word but in the wrong position (so the secret word has a 'C' somewhere not at the start).
 - R is not in the word at all.
 - A is not in the word at all.
 - N is present but in the wrong position (so secret word has an 'N' somewhere, but not in the fourth position).
 - E is not in the word.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters: C and N (but not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"").
 - The secret word does not contain: R, A, E.

 Also, note that the secret word does not have:
 - A first letter 'C' (since if it were correct it would be 'C(✓)', but we got 'C(-)'), meaning C is present but not at the start.
 - Similarly, the fourth letter is not 'N', but N is present elsewhere.

 Let me think about the positions:
 - The secret word has 5 letters.
 - The first letter cannot be C? Actually, the feedback for C is '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the first position. So C must be in positions 2,3,4, or 5? But wait, since our guess had C at position 1 and it's marked '-' that just means position 1 is not C. But C is somewhere else.

 But note: the feedback does not tell us where else C might be, just that it is in the word but not at position 1.

 Similarly, for N: it was at position 4 in our guess, but it must be in the word at a different position (one of 1,2,3,5).

 We also know the absence of R, A, and E.

 Now, we need to make a new guess that:
 1. Is a valid 5-letter English word.
 2. Contains the letters C and N (since they are in the secret word) and avoids R, A, E.
 3. Does not put C at the start (since we know that's wrong) and does not put N at the fourth position.

 Additionally, we can try to cover other common letters.

 Let me think of words that have C and N and avoid A, E, R.

 Common letters left: We can use other vowels? The word must have vowels. The vowels we haven't tried are: O, U, I, and sometimes Y.

 So possible letters to consider: O, U, I, and consonants like L, T, S, etc.

 I am considering a word that has C and N and uses other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - We can try to put C in positions 2-5 and N in positions 1,2,3, or 5.

 Example words:
 - Since we know C cannot be first, we can try words that start with a different letter.

 Let me think:
 Option 1: Start with another vowel? e.g., ""O"" or ""I""
 - Words with O: ""ONION"" -> but has O twice and no C? Doesn't have C.
 - Words with U: ""UNCLE"" -> U, N, C, L, E -> but E is forbidden (we know E is not in the word). So discard.

 Let me avoid letters we know are absent: R, A, E.

 Also, we must include C and N.

 Another idea: ""CLINT"" -> but we have R, A, E absent? C in first position? We know C cannot be first? Actually, our guess ""crane"" had C at position 1 and it was '-' meaning the first letter of the secret word isn't C. So we must avoid putting C at position 1 again.

 So ""CLINT"" has C at the start -> not allowed.

 How about ""CONIC""? -> C is at the start, so not allowed.

 Another word: ""SCION"" -> S,C,I,O,N.
 - Check: S (position 1), C (position 2), I (position 3), O (position 4), N (position 5).
 - This word has C at position 2 and N at position 5 (which is not position 4 as in the previous guess, so that's good).
 - Letters: S, C, I, O, N. None of R, A, E.

 But wait: We don't have any information about these other letters (S, I, O). They could be in the word or not.

 Another possibility: ""MUSIC"" -> but has U, S, I, C. Also, M? And note: N is missing? We must include N. So ""MUSIC"" doesn't have N.

 We must have both C and N.

 Another candidate: ""NICOL"" -> N at position 1? Then I, C, O, L. But note: we don't know if N can be at position 1? Yes, because in the previous guess N was at position 4 and was wrong, but it can be at position 1.

 However, we also have to consider: the feedback told us that C is in the word (but not at position 1) and N is in the word (but not at position 4). So N at position 1 is acceptable.

 But let me spell ""NICOL"": Is that a word? I think of ""Nicol"" as a name? But we need a valid English word. Alternatively, ""NICOL"" might not be common.

 Instead, what about ""CONCH""? Again, C is first -> not allowed.

 Another word: ""INCOG"" -> not a word.

 Alternatively: ""SCONE"" -> S,C,O,N,E -> but E is forbidden. So no.

 What about ""SONIC""? S,O,N,I,C -> 
 - Letters: S, O, N, I, C -> includes N and C, and avoids R, A, E.
 - Positions: 
   - S at 1 -> not C at start
   - C at the end (position 5) -> so that's a different position from before (we had C at 1 and N at 4, now C at 5 and N at 3).
 - This word seems promising.

 But note: the secret word has C and N, so ""SONIC"" includes both.

 How about ""SCORN""? -> has R which is absent? R is forbidden because feedback said R is not in the word. So avoid R.

 What about ""CLINK""? -> C at start? No, we cannot have C at the start.

 How about ""ONCET""? Not common.

 Alternatively: ""OUNCE"" -> contains E -> forbidden.

 Another word: ""MINCE"" -> contains E -> forbidden.

 What about ""LUNCH"" -> contains U and H? But also L, U, N, C, H -> no A, E, R? Yes. And N at position 3, C at position 4? Also, we have C not at the start? L starts, so OK.

 But wait: does ""LUNCH"" have a letter that we know is absent? We know R, A, E are absent. U is not in the known absent list? Actually we don't know about U. So it's possible.

 How about ""CUNTS""? -> C at start -> not allowed.

 Alternatively: ""PINCH"" -> P, I, N, C, H -> doesn't have R, A, E. And C is at position 4? and N at 3? And no C at start? P is at start.

 So ""PINCH"" could be a candidate.

 Similarly: ""WINCH"", ""BENCH"" -> but BENCH has E -> forbidden.

 So candidates: 
 1. SONIC: S, O, N, I, C -> positions: S1, O2, N3, I4, C5.
 2. PINCH: P1, I2, N3, C4, H5.

 But note: we also know that in the secret word N cannot be at position 4? Actually, no: we only know from the previous guess that position 4 was N and it was marked as '-' meaning N is in the word but not at position 4. So position 4 cannot be N. However, in our new guesses, that rule only applies to the secret word's positions? We are free to guess any word? Actually, we are guessing and then we'll get feedback. But we want to maximize information.

 However, we must include C and N and avoid R, A, E.

 Given that, I'll choose ""SONIC"" because it also covers more common letters: S, O, I.

 Alternatively, we can think of a word that doesn't have C at start and doesn't have N at position 4? Both candidates satisfy.

 Let me list more words? 
 - ""STOIC"" -> S,T,O,I,C -> T is acceptable? No R,A,E? But N is missing? Must include N. So discard.

 We must include N.

 Another: ""CONKS"" -> C at start? -> not allowed.

 How about ""NICKS"" -> N at start? -> acceptable. Letters: N, I, C, K, S -> no R,A,E? And C is at position 3? But we don't know if N can be at position 1? It could be.

 But note: in the secret word, we don't have R, A, E. Also, our goal is to find words that help us locate C and N.

 I think ""SONIC"" works because:
 - S at position 1: we haven't tested S before.
 - O at position 2: new letter.
 - N at position 3: we know N is in the word but not at position 4? This is position 3 so it might be correct? We don't know.
 - I at position 4: new letter.
 - C at position 5: we know C is in the word and isn't at position 1? So at position 5? It could be.

 So, let's go with ""SONIC"".

 Therefore, my second guess is ""sonic"".

<guess>sonic</guess>After evaluating the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (`C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)`), we know the secret word contains **C** and **N** (but **C cannot be at position 1** and **N cannot be at position 4**) and excludes **R, A, and E**. 

For the next guess:
- Must include **C** and **N** while avoiding R, A, E.
- C should not be in position 1.
- N should not be in position 4.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, O, I) to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **""SONIC""**:
- **S** at position 1 (untested position/letter).
- **O** at position 2 (new vowel).
- **N** at position 3 (avoids position 4).
- **I** at position 4 (new vowel).
- **C** at position 5 (avoids position 1).

This adheres to the feedback constraints and efficiently probes new letters/positions.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Guess 2: ""sonic"" -> S(✓) O(-) N(-) I(-) C(-)
Meaning:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- O is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 3.
- I is in the word but not in position 4.
- C is in the word but not in position 5.

Now, combining the information:

1. The secret word starts with S (since S is correct at position 1).
2. The secret word contains: C, O, N, I (from the feedback of both guesses) and we already knew C and N from the first guess, and now we know O and I are also present.
3. The secret word does not contain: R, A, E (from the first guess).

Additionally, we have position constraints:
- C cannot be in position 1 (from first guess) and now also cannot be in position 5 (from second guess). So C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- N cannot be in position 4 (from first guess) and now also cannot be in position 3 (from second guess). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 5. But position 1 is S (fixed), so N must be in position 2 or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2 (from second guess). So O must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 1 is S, so O must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 (from second guess). So I must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. But position 1 is S, so I must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Also, note that the word has 5 letters and we know 5 letters that must be in it: S, C, O, N, I. But wait, the word must have exactly these 5 letters? Not necessarily, because we might have duplicates? But in the feedback, we don't see any duplicate markings. However, we cannot assume there are no duplicates. But in this case, we have 5 distinct letters: S, C, O, N, I. And we know the word has at least these 5, so it must be exactly these 5 letters? Because a 5-letter word cannot have more than 5 letters. So the secret word is a permutation of S, C, O, N, I.

Therefore, the secret word is an anagram of these 5 letters: S, C, O, N, I.

Now, we know:
- Position 1 is S (fixed).
- The remaining letters are C, O, N, I to be placed in positions 2,3,4,5.

Constraints:
- C: cannot be in position 1 (already known) and not in position 5 (from second guess). So C must be in position 2, 3, or 4? But we have positions 2,3,4,5 and we know C cannot be in 5? So C must be in 2,3, or 4.
- N: cannot be in position 3 (from second guess) and cannot be in position 4 (from first guess). So N cannot be in 3 or 4. Also, position 1 is taken by S, so N must be in position 2 or 5? But we have positions 2,3,4,5 and N can only be in 2 or 5? But 5 is available? Yes.
- O: cannot be in position 2 (from second guess). So O must be in 3,4, or 5.
- I: cannot be in position 4 (from second guess). So I must be in 2,3, or 5.

Now, let's list possible positions:

Position 2: can be C, N, or I (but not O, because O cannot be in 2). Also, N can be in 2? Yes.

Position 3: can be C, O, I (but not N, because N cannot be in 3). Also, O can be in 3? Yes.

Position 4: can be C, O (but not N, because N cannot be in 4, and not I because I cannot be in 4). So only C or O can be in position 4? But wait, we have to assign all letters. Also, note that I cannot be in 4, so position 4 must be either C or O.

Position 5: can be N, O, I (and also C? but C cannot be in 5, so position 5 cannot be C). So position 5 must be N, O, or I.

Now, let's consider the possibilities for position 4: it must be C or O.

Case 1: Position 4 is C.
Then, we have to assign O, N, I to positions 2,3,5.

Constraints for these:
- Position 2: cannot be O (because O cannot be in 2) -> so position 2 must be N or I.
- Position 3: cannot be N -> so must be O or I? But O can be in 3, and I can be in 3.
- Position 5: can be N, O, I.

Also, note that N must be in 2 or 5.

Subcases:
- If position 2 is N, then position 5 can be O or I, and position 3 must be the remaining one (O or I) and also O can be in 3? Yes. So:
  - If position 2 is N, then position 3 and 5 are O and I in some order? But we have two choices: 
      Option A: pos3=O, pos5=I -> word: S, N, O, C, I -> ""SNOCI"" (is that a word? We'll check later)
      Option B: pos3=I, pos5=O -> word: S, N, I, C, O -> ""SNICO"" (probably not a word)

- If position 2 is I, then position 5 must be N (because N must be in 2 or 5, and 2 is taken by I, so 5 must be N). Then position 3 must be O (the only one left). So word: S, I, O, C, N -> ""SIOCN"" (probably not a word)

So in Case 1, the only plausible word is ""SNOCI"" (if it is a word) or we might have to check.

Case 2: Position 4 is O.
Then, we have to assign C, N, I to positions 2,3,5.

Constraints:
- C: must be in 2,3, or 4? But position 4 is O, so C must be in 2 or 3 (since not 5).
- N: must be in 2 or 5 (and not 3 or 4, which is already satisfied because 4 is O and 3 is not assigned yet but we know N cannot be in 3).
- I: cannot be in 4 (which is already O, so okay) and can be in 2,3,5.

Now, position 4 is O, so we have positions 2,3,5 for C, N, I.

But C must be in 2 or 3.

Also, N must be in 2 or 5.

Let's consider:

- If position 2 is C, then:
  - N must be in 5 (since 2 is taken by C, and N must be in 2 or 5).
  - Then position 3 must be I.
  - Word: S, C, I, O, N -> ""SCION"" (which is a word: meaning a descendant or a young shoot of a plant)

- If position 2 is N, then:
  - C must be in 3 (since C must be in 2 or 3, and 2 is taken by N, so 3 must be C).
  - Then position 5 must be I (the only one left).
  - Word: S, N, C, O, I -> ""SNCOI"" (not a common word)

- If position 2 is I, then:
  - C must be in 3 (since 2 is taken by I, and C must be in 2 or 3).
  - Then N must be in 5 (since 2 is taken, so 5 must be N).
  - Word: S, I, C, O, N -> ""SICON"" (not a common word)

So in Case 2, the only plausible word is ""SCION"".

Now, we also had in Case 1 a possibility: ""SNOCI"" (if it is a word). But ""SNOCI"" is not a standard English word. Similarly, ""SNICO"", ""SIOCN"", ""SNCOI"", ""SICON"" are not words.

Therefore, the only candidate we have so far is ""SCION"".

But wait, we must check if there are other possibilities? We assumed the word is exactly the letters S,C,O,N,I. Is that necessarily true? 

In the feedback, we have:
- First guess: we learned C and N are present, and R,A,E absent.
- Second guess: we learned S, O, I are present (and also C and N again, which we already knew). And we have 5 letters: S, O, N, I, C. Since the word is 5 letters, and we have 5 distinct letters that are present, then the word must be composed of exactly these 5 letters. So yes, it must be an anagram.

Therefore, the only valid English word we found is ""SCION"".

But let me confirm the feedback for ""SCION"" if it were the secret word? We don't know the secret word, but we can check if it fits the feedback.

If secret word is ""SCION"":
- First guess ""crane"": 
  - C is in the word but not at position 1 (in ""SCION"", C is at position 2) -> so C(-) is correct.
  - R is not in ""SCION"" -> R(x) correct.
  - A not in -> A(x) correct.
  - N is in the word but not at position 4 (in ""SCION"", N is at position 5) -> N(-) correct.
  - E not in -> E(x) correct.

- Second guess ""sonic"":
  - S is at position 1 -> S(✓) correct.
  - O is in the word but not at position 2 (in ""SCION"", O is at position 4) -> O(-) correct.
  - N is in the word but not at position 3 (in ""SCION"", N is at position 5) -> N(-) correct.
  - I is in the word but not at position 4 (in ""SCION"", I is at position 3) -> I(-) correct.
  - C is in the word but not at position 5 (in ""SCION"", C is at position 2) -> C(-) correct.

So it fits.

But are there other anagrams? We might have missed some.

List of anagrams of S,C,O,N,I that are English words:

1. SCION - as above.
2. SONIC - but we already guessed ""sonic"" and it got feedback that O is not at 2, N not at 3, I not at 4, C not at 5. But in ""SONIC"", O is at 2? But the feedback said O(-) meaning it is present but not at 2? So ""SONIC"" cannot be the secret word because in ""SONIC"" O is at position 2, but the feedback for our guess ""sonic"" said O is not at position 2. Therefore, ""SONIC"" is ruled out.

3. COINS - but C is at position 1? We know the first letter is S, so not C. So invalid.

4. ICONS - first letter I? But we know first letter is S. So invalid.

5. CIONS - same as SCION? Actually, ""cions"" is a variant of scion, but it starts with C? So not S.

6. Other anagrams: 
   - S I C O N -> ""SICON"" not a word.
   - S N O C I -> ""SNOCI"" not a word.
   - S N I C O -> ""SNICO"" not a word.
   - S O C I N -> ""SOCIN"" not a word? (but there is a historical sect called Socinian, but 5 letters? SOCIN is not a word)
   - S O N C I -> ""SONCI"" not a word.
   - S I O C N -> ""SIOCN"" not a word.

So the only valid word is ""SCION"".

Therefore, we should guess ""SCION"".

But note: we are allowed to guess it? Yes, because we haven't guessed it before.

So the next guess is ""scion"".

But let me double-check: in the feedback for the second guess, we have S(✓) meaning the first letter is S. And in ""SCION"", the first letter is S. And the rest: C at 2, I at 3, O at 4, N at 5.

So we are confident.

Therefore, the next guess is ""scion"".

Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → `C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)`  
  - **C** and **N** are in the word but not in positions 1 or 4, respectively.  
  - **R, A, E** are absent.  

- **Guess 2: ""sonic""** → `S(✓) O(-) N(-) I(-) C(-)`  
  - **S** is correct and in position 1.  
  - **O, N, I, C** are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, respectively.  

### Key Insights:  
1. The secret word **starts with S** (position 1).  
2. It contains **C, O, N, I** (and no other letters, since 5 distinct letters are confirmed).  
3. **C** cannot be in positions 1 or 5 → must be in **2, 3, or 4**.  
4. **N** cannot be in positions 3 or 4 → must be in **2 or 5** (position 1 is taken by S).  
5. **O** cannot be in position 2 → must be in **3, 4, or 5**.  
6. **I** cannot be in position 4 → must be in **2, 3, or 5**.  

The only valid English word fitting all constraints is **""SCION""**:  
- **S** (position 1, correct).  
- **C** in position 2 (allowed, since C cannot be in 1 or 5).  
- **I** in position 3 (allowed, since I cannot be in 4).  
- **O** in position 4 (allowed, since O cannot be in 2).  
- **N** in position 5 (allowed, since N cannot be in 3 or 4).  

<guess>scion</guess>",scion,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Guess 2: ""sonic"" -> S(✓) O(-) N(-) I(-) C(-)
Meaning:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- O is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 3.
- I is in the word but not in position 4.
- C is in the word but not in position 5.

Now, combining the information:

1. The secret word starts with S (since S is correct at position 1).
2. The secret word contains: C, O, N, I (from the feedback of both guesses) and we already knew C and N from the first guess, and now we know O and I are also present.
3. The secret word does not contain: R, A, E (from the first guess).

Additionally, we have position constraints:
- C cannot be in position 1 (from first guess) and now also cannot be in position 5 (from second guess). So C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- N cannot be in position 4 (from first guess) and now also cannot be in position 3 (from second guess). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 5. But position 1 is S (fixed), so N must be in position 2 or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2 (from second guess). So O must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 1 is S, so O must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 (from second guess). So I must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. But position 1 is S, so I must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Also, note that the word has 5 letters and we know 5 letters that must be in it: S, C, O, N, I. But wait, the word must have exactly these 5 letters? Not necessarily, because we might have duplicates? But in the feedback, we don't see any duplicate markings. However, we cannot assume there are no duplicates. But in this case, we have 5 distinct letters: S, C, O, N, I. And we know the word has at least these 5, so it must be exactly these 5 letters? Because a 5-letter word cannot have more than 5 letters. So the secret word is a permutation of S, C, O, N, I.

Therefore, the secret word is an anagram of these 5 letters: S, C, O, N, I.

Now, we know:
- Position 1 is S (fixed).
- The remaining letters are C, O, N, I to be placed in positions 2,3,4,5.

Constraints:
- C: cannot be in position 1 (already known) and not in position 5 (from second guess). So C must be in position 2, 3, or 4? But we have positions 2,3,4,5 and we know C cannot be in 5? So C must be in 2,3, or 4.
- N: cannot be in position 3 (from second guess) and cannot be in position 4 (from first guess). So N cannot be in 3 or 4. Also, position 1 is taken by S, so N must be in position 2 or 5? But we have positions 2,3,4,5 and N can only be in 2 or 5? But 5 is available? Yes.
- O: cannot be in position 2 (from second guess). So O must be in 3,4, or 5.
- I: cannot be in position 4 (from second guess). So I must be in 2,3, or 5.

Now, let's list possible positions:

Position 2: can be C, N, or I (but not O, because O cannot be in 2). Also, N can be in 2? Yes.

Position 3: can be C, O, I (but not N, because N cannot be in 3). Also, O can be in 3? Yes.

Position 4: can be C, O (but not N, because N cannot be in 4, and not I because I cannot be in 4). So only C or O can be in position 4? But wait, we have to assign all letters. Also, note that I cannot be in 4, so position 4 must be either C or O.

Position 5: can be N, O, I (and also C? but C cannot be in 5, so position 5 cannot be C). So position 5 must be N, O, or I.

Now, let's consider the possibilities for position 4: it must be C or O.

Case 1: Position 4 is C.
Then, we have to assign O, N, I to positions 2,3,5.

Constraints for these:
- Position 2: cannot be O (because O cannot be in 2) -> so position 2 must be N or I.
- Position 3: cannot be N -> so must be O or I? But O can be in 3, and I can be in 3.
- Position 5: can be N, O, I.

Also, note that N must be in 2 or 5.

Subcases:
- If position 2 is N, then position 5 can be O or I, and position 3 must be the remaining one (O or I) and also O can be in 3? Yes. So:
  - If position 2 is N, then position 3 and 5 are O and I in some order? But we have two choices: 
      Option A: pos3=O, pos5=I -> word: S, N, O, C, I -> ""SNOCI"" (is that a word? We'll check later)
      Option B: pos3=I, pos5=O -> word: S, N, I, C, O -> ""SNICO"" (probably not a word)

- If position 2 is I, then position 5 must be N (because N must be in 2 or 5, and 2 is taken by I, so 5 must be N). Then position 3 must be O (the only one left). So word: S, I, O, C, N -> ""SIOCN"" (probably not a word)

So in Case 1, the only plausible word is ""SNOCI"" (if it is a word) or we might have to check.

Case 2: Position 4 is O.
Then, we have to assign C, N, I to positions 2,3,5.

Constraints:
- C: must be in 2,3, or 4? But position 4 is O, so C must be in 2 or 3 (since not 5).
- N: must be in 2 or 5 (and not 3 or 4, which is already satisfied because 4 is O and 3 is not assigned yet but we know N cannot be in 3).
- I: cannot be in 4 (which is already O, so okay) and can be in 2,3,5.

Now, position 4 is O, so we have positions 2,3,5 for C, N, I.

But C must be in 2 or 3.

Also, N must be in 2 or 5.

Let's consider:

- If position 2 is C, then:
  - N must be in 5 (since 2 is taken by C, and N must be in 2 or 5).
  - Then position 3 must be I.
  - Word: S, C, I, O, N -> ""SCION"" (which is a word: meaning a descendant or a young shoot of a plant)

- If position 2 is N, then:
  - C must be in 3 (since C must be in 2 or 3, and 2 is taken by N, so 3 must be C).
  - Then position 5 must be I (the only one left).
  - Word: S, N, C, O, I -> ""SNCOI"" (not a common word)

- If position 2 is I, then:
  - C must be in 3 (since 2 is taken by I, and C must be in 2 or 3).
  - Then N must be in 5 (since 2 is taken, so 5 must be N).
  - Word: S, I, C, O, N -> ""SICON"" (not a common word)

So in Case 2, the only plausible word is ""SCION"".

Now, we also had in Case 1 a possibility: ""SNOCI"" (if it is a word). But ""SNOCI"" is not a standard English word. Similarly, ""SNICO"", ""SIOCN"", ""SNCOI"", ""SICON"" are not words.

Therefore, the only candidate we have so far is ""SCION"".

But wait, we must check if there are other possibilities? We assumed the word is exactly the letters S,C,O,N,I. Is that necessarily true? 

In the feedback, we have:

Since the word is 5 letters, and we have 5 distinct letters that are present, then the word must be composed of exactly these 5 letters. So yes, it must be an anagram.

Therefore, the only valid English word we found is ""SCION"".

But let me confirm the feedback for ""SCION"" if it were the secret word? We don't know the secret word, but we can check if it fits the feedback.

If secret word is ""SCION"":
- First guess ""crane"": 
  - C is in the word but not at position 1 (in ""SCION"", C is at position 2) -> so C(-) is correct.
  - R is not in ""SCION"" -> R(x) correct.
  - A not in -> A(x) correct.
  - N is in the word but not at position 4 (in ""SCION"", N is at position 5) -> N(-) correct.
  - E not in -> E(x) correct.

- Second guess ""sonic"":
  - S is at position 1 -> S(✓) correct.
  - O is in the word but not at position 2 (in ""SCION"", O is at position 4) -> O(-) correct.
  - N is in the word but not at position 3 (in ""SCION"", N is at position 5) -> N(-) correct.
  - I is in the word but not at position 4 (in ""SCION"", I is at position 3) -> I(-) correct.
  - C is in the word but not at position 5 (in ""SCION"", C is at position 2) -> C(-) correct.

So it fits.

But are there other anagrams? We might have missed some.

List of anagrams of S,C,O,N,I that are English words:
