We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - The letter 'E' is in the secret word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"", E is the last letter and we got a '-', meaning it's present but in the wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'E' but not in the 5th position, and it does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Since we know the secret word has 5 letters and contains an 'E' (but not at the end), we can try to think of words that have an 'E' in one of the first four positions.

 Also, we must avoid using the letters C, R, A, N.

 We have 6 tries, so we can use this second guess to test more common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: 
 Vowels: We have E (already known to be present), but we don't know about others. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). 
 Consonants: We have many: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has an 'E' that is not in the 5th position. So it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Since we don't have much information, we should choose a word that:
 1. Contains the letter 'E' (to confirm its position and because we know it's in the word).
 2. Uses other common letters that we haven't tried (so avoid C, R, A, N).

 Let's try to pick a word that has 'E' in a different position and includes other common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

 Example: We could try ""TIMES"", but note that we have to avoid A and R (which we are avoiding, and in ""TIMES"" we don't have A or R). However, we have to check the letters: T, I, M, E, S.

 But wait: we don't know if T, I, M, S are in the word. This guess would help us test those.

 However, note that the feedback for the first guess told us that E is present but not at the end. In ""TIMES"", E is at the 4th position and S at the end. If we get feedback that E is now in the correct position, then we know it's the 4th. Otherwise, if it's still in the wrong position, then we know it must be in 1, 2, or 3.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts E in the first position? But that might be less common.

 Another idea: use a word that has E in the second position? Like ""LEAST"" but we cannot use A (since A is not in the word). So we must avoid A.

 Let's think of words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5.

 Some options:
 - ""BELIE"": but that has 5 letters? Actually, ""BELIE"" is 5 letters. But it has two E's? Actually, it ends with E, but we know E is not at the end? So we cannot put E at the end. So we must avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, we need a word that has E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, and does not have C, R, A, N.

 Let me list some words:
 - Position 1: ""EAGLE"" -> but has A (forbidden) and ends with E (which we know is not the position for E? Actually, we know E is not at the end, so we can have E at the beginning and then another E at the end? But the feedback only said one E is present? Actually, the feedback for the first guess: we had one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. It doesn't say there is only one E. So there could be multiple E's? But in the feedback, only one E was in the word? Actually, the feedback symbol is per letter. In ""crane"", we had one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. So at least one E is in the word. There could be more.

 However, we don't know. So we have to consider that possibility.

 But to be safe, let's avoid using two E's for now? We can use one E in a different position.

 Another word: ""TIMES"" has E at the 4th position and S at the end. But we don't know if S is in the word. Also, we are testing T, I, M, S.

 But note: we are allowed to use any valid English word. And we are trying to get as much information as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPIEL"" (which has E at the 4th position) but that's 5 letters? Yes. And it doesn't contain C, R, A, N. But it has S, P, I, E, L.

 However, we don't know if S, P, I, L are in the word.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but ends with E, which we know is not the position for the E we found? Actually, we know that the E we found (from the first guess) is not at the end. But if the word has two E's, then one could be at the end? But the feedback only showed one E as present. So if the secret word has an E at the end, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has E at the end) we would have gotten a check for that E? But we got a '-' meaning that the E is in the word but not at the end. So the secret word does not have an E at the end. Therefore, we must avoid putting E at the end in our guesses? Actually, we can put E at the end to test, but we know that the secret word does not have E at the end. So if we put E at the end and it is marked as absent, that would be consistent. But if it is marked as present, that would mean there is another E? But we don't know.

 However, to maximize information, we should avoid the end for E because we know the E we found is not at the end. So we should try to put E in one of the first four positions, but not the same as in ""crane"" (which was position 5). In ""crane"", E was at position 5, so we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4.

 Let me choose a word that has E in the second position? For example, ""LEMON"" -> but we cannot use A, R, and also we are avoiding C, R, A, N? L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden (we got N(x) in the first feedback). So we cannot use N.

 So we must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Therefore, let's try to pick a word without those and with E in a new position.

 I think ""TIMES"" is a good candidate because:
 - It has E in the 4th position (which is different from the 5th and we can see if that's the correct spot).
 - It uses T, I, M, S which are common and we haven't tested.

 But note: we are not sure if the secret word has E only once. If it has two E's, then we might get more feedback.

 Alternatively, we can try ""BELTS"": 
 - B, E, L, T, S -> E is in the second position. And we avoid C, R, A, N.

 But we don't know if B, L, T, S are in the word.

 Another option: ""DUVET"" -> but ends with T? Actually, D, U, V, E, T -> E is in the 4th position? Actually, positions: 1:D, 2:U, 3:V, 4:E, 5:T. So E is at 4. But we don't know if D, U, V, T are in the word. Also, ""DUVET"" is a valid word.

 However, I think ""TIMES"" is more common and uses more common letters.

 But wait: we have to consider that the secret word does not have A, R, C, N. So words without those are acceptable.

 Let me go with ""TIMES"".

 So my second guess is ""TIMES"".

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

 But note: if the secret word has E in the 4th position, then in ""TIMES"" the E would be marked as correct (✓). If not, then it would be marked as present but wrong position (-) or absent (x). But we know E is in the word, so it won't be absent. So we'll get either ✓ or - for E.

 Also, we'll get information about T, I, M, S.

 Let's write it in the required format.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Include E in a position other than the 5th (positions 1–4) to test its correct location.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, M) to maximize new information.

A strong second guess is **""TIMES""** because:
- It includes E in the 4th position (testing if E belongs there).
- It uses new common letters (T, I, M, S) not yet tested.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

 - ""BELIE"": but that has 5 letters? Actually, ""BELIE"" is 5 letters. But it has two E's? Actually, it ends with E, but we know E is not at the end? So we cannot put E at the end. So we must avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, we need a word that has E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, and does not have C, R, A, N.

 Let me list some words:
 - Position 1: ""EAGLE"" -> but has A (forbidden) and ends with E (which we know is not the position for E? Actually, we know E is not at the end, so we can have E at the beginning and then another E at the end? But the feedback only said one E is present? Actually, the feedback for the first guess: we had one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. It doesn't say there is only one E. So there could be multiple E's? But in the feedback, only one E was in the word? Actually, the feedback symbol is per letter. In ""crane"", we had one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. So at least one E is in the word. There could be more.

 However, we don't know. So we have to consider that possibility.

 But to be safe, let's avoid using two E's for now? We can use one E in a different position.

 Another word: ""TIMES"" has E at the 4th position and S at the end. But we don't know if S is in the word. Also, we are testing T, I, M, S.

 But note: we are allowed to use any valid English word. And we are trying to get as much information as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPIEL"" (which has E at the 4th position) but that's 5 letters? Yes. And it doesn't contain C, R, A, N. But it has S, P, I, E, L.

 However, we don't know if S, P, I, L are in the word.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but ends with E, which we know is not the position for the E we found? Actually, we know that the E we found (from the first guess) is not at the end. But if the word has two E's, then one could be at the end? But the feedback only showed one E as present. So if the secret word has an E at the end, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has E at the end) we would have gotten a check for that E? But we got a '-' meaning that the E is in the word but not at the end. So the secret word does not have an E at the end. Therefore, we must avoid putting E at the end in our guesses? Actually, we can put E at the end to test, but we know that the secret word does not have E at the end. So if we put E at the end and it is marked as absent, that would be consistent. But if it is marked as present, that would mean there is another E? But we don't know.

 However, to maximize information, we should avoid the end for E because we know the E we found is not at the end. So we should try to put E in one of the first four positions, but not the same as in ""crane"" (which was position 5). In ""crane"", E was at position 5, so we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4.

 Let me choose a word that has E in the second position? For example, ""LEMON"" -> but we cannot use A, R, and also we are avoiding C, R, A, N? L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden (we got N(x) in the first feedback). So we cannot use N.

 So we must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Therefore, let's try to pick a word without those and with E in a new position.

 I think ""TIMES"" is a good candidate because:
 - It has E in the 4th position (which is different from the 5th and we can see if that's the correct spot).
 - It uses T, I, M, S which are common and we haven't tested.

 But note: we are not sure if the secret word has E only once. If it has two E's, then we might get more feedback.

 Alternatively, we can try ""BELTS"": 
 - B, E, L, T, S -> E is in the second position. And we avoid C, R, A, N.

 But we don't know if B, L, T, S are in the word.

 Another option: ""DUVET"" -> but ends with T? Actually, D, U, V, E, T -> E is in the 4th position? Actually, positions: 1:D, 2:U, 3:V, 4:E, 5:T. So E is at 4. But we don't know if D, U, V, T are in the word. Also, ""DUVET"" is a valid word.

 However, I think ""TIMES"" is more common and uses more common letters.

 But wait: we have to consider that the secret word does not have A, R, C, N. So words without those are acceptable.

 Let me go with ""TIMES"".

 So my second guess is ""TIMES"".

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

 But note: if the secret word has E in the 4th position, then in ""TIMES"" the E would be marked as correct (✓). If not, then it would be marked as present but wrong position (-) or absent (x). But we know E is in the word, so it won't be absent. So we'll get either ✓ or - for E.

 Also, we'll get information about T, I, M, S.

 Let's write it in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Include E in a position other than the 5th (positions 1–4) to test its correct location.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, M) to maximize new information.

A strong second guess is **""TIMES""** because:
- It includes E in the 4th position (testing if E belongs there).
- It uses new common letters (T, I, M, S) not yet tested.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word.
- E is in the secret word, but not in position 5 (where it was in ""crane"").

Second guess: ""times"" -> T(-) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(-)
Interpretation:
- T is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- I and M are not in the secret word.
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (since it's marked as present but wrong position).
- S is in the word but not in position 5.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains E, T, and S. But note: E is known from the first guess, and now we add T and S.
- Letters not present: C, R, A, N, I, M.
- We must find the positions for E, T, and S, and two more letters.

Additionally, from the feedback:
- E is not in position 4 (from ""times"") and not in position 5 (from ""crane""). So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- T is not in position 1 (from ""times""), so it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- S is not in position 5 (from ""times""), so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also have two positions still unknown and letters we haven't guessed.

We should avoid any letters that have been excluded: C, R, A, N, I, M.

Now, since we have E, T, S in the word, and we need two more letters, we can think of common English letters that haven't been tested: for example, B, D, G, H, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also need to consider the positions:

Let me denote the positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

E must be in 1,2, or 3.
T cannot be in 1.
S cannot be in 5.

Also, from the feedback of ""times"":
- At position 1: T is present (but wrong position), so position 1 of the secret word is not T. But we already know that.
- Position 4: E is present but wrong position? Actually, in ""times"", position 4 is E, and it's marked as present but wrong. Therefore, E is not at position 4.

But we already deduced that.

Now, note that the secret word has S, but in ""times"" it was at position 5? Actually, in ""times"", S is at position 5, and we got S(-) meaning S is present but not at position 5. So S is somewhere else.

Similarly, E was at position 4 in ""times"" and we got E(-), meaning E is not at position 4.

Also, T was at position 1 in ""times"" and we got T(-), meaning T is present but not at position 1.

Now, we must form a new guess that includes E, T, S and two new letters, avoiding C, R, A, N, I, M.

We also need to avoid placing T at position 1, S at position 5, and E at positions 4 or 5. And also, if we can, test E at a new position to narrow it down.

Currently, E has been tried at position 5 (in ""crane"") and position 4 (in ""times"") and both times it was present but wrong position. So E is either in 1, 2, or 3.

We can try to place E at position 1, for example? Or position 2 or 3.

Similarly, T and S can be placed in other positions.

But note: we might have constraints based on the feedback.

Let me try to think of words that start with E? Since E can be in position 1.

Example: ""EDGES"" but wait, we don't know G or D, and also E is repeated? But let's check the word: E, D, G, E, S. That's two E's and an S.

But we have an E at position 1 and position 4? And S at the end? But we know S cannot be at position 5? So if we put S at position 5, we expect it to be marked as absent? Not necessarily, because if the secret word also has an S at another position, then S at position 5 would be marked as absent only if there isn't a second S? Actually, Wordle-style feedback: for each letter, it marks it as green if correct position, yellow if present but wrong position, and gray if not present. If there are multiple same letters, each one is considered independently.

But note in our case: we already know S is in the word from ""times"", so if we put S at position 5 and it is the only S, but the secret word has S at another position, then S in position 5 would be marked as present? But that's not possible because the feedback only gives yellow if the letter is in the word but not in that position. So if the secret word has S, and we guess S at a position where it is not, then we get a yellow. But if we guess an extra S (more than the secret has), the extra would be gray? But in ""times"", we guessed one S at position 5, and it was yellow. So the secret word has exactly one S? Or more? Actually, no: it's unknown. It might have one or more. The yellow at position 5 means that there is an S in the word, but not at that position. So if there is already one S, then if we guess an S at position 5, and if there is no second S, it would be gray? Actually, I think the feedback per letter is:

The game checks each letter independently. For a given letter in the guess:
- If that specific position is correct, mark green.
- Otherwise, if the letter occurs anywhere else in the word and that occurrence has not been accounted for, mark yellow.
- Otherwise, gray.

But for each instance, so in ""times"", S is at the end and marked yellow. That means that S is in the secret word, but not at position 5, and also, there is at least one other occurrence of S? Or not? Actually, the secret word could have exactly one S, but it's at a different position. So when we guess S at position 5, since it's not correct, and since there is an S at say position 2, then we get a yellow.

So the number of yellows and grays per letter depends on the count.

Now, back to our case: we know S is in the word, and not at position 5. Similarly, E is in the word, not at positions 4 or 5.

For our next guess, we should try to put E at a new position (like position 1 or 2 or 3) to test, and similarly for T and S.

We can also try to avoid positions that are known wrong.

I think we have enough information to start forming a word. Let's list the available letters: besides E, T, S, we want two new letters. Common letters left: O, L, B, D, G, H, K, P, U, W, Y.

We should choose a word that:
- Contains E, T, S, and two new letters.
- Positions: E not at 4 or 5, T not at 1, S not at 5.

Also, we can try to put E at position 1 or 2? For example, if we start with E, then we can see if it is green.

Possible word: ""ENTRY"" but we know N is excluded and R is excluded. Not possible.

Another word: ""BELTS"" -> but B, E, L, T, S. Positions: E at 2, T at 4, S at 5? But we know S cannot be at position 5? And we are putting S at 5? That might not be good because we know it's not there. Also, if we put S at 5 and the secret word does have S at position 5? But the feedback for ""times"" said S is not at 5? Yes, because ""times"" had S at 5 and got a yellow. But in Wordle, if the secret word doesn't have S at 5, then when we guess S at 5 we get yellow? But in this case, we know that S is in the word but not at position 5, so we should avoid placing S at 5? Not necessarily, because if we do, it will be marked yellow again? But that doesn't give us new information? Actually, it would be redundant. So to maximize information, we should place S at a position where it might be correct.

Similarly for T: we know T is not at position 1, and it could be at 2,3,4,5.

Similarly for E: positions 1,2,3.

So let's try to put S in position 1, for example? Or position 2 or 3 or 4.

Similarly, T should not be at 1.

And E at 1,2, or 3.

Possible word: ""STEEL"" but wait, that has two E's? Also, L is a possible letter. But ""STEEL"" has S at 1, T at 2, E at 3 and 4? But we know E cannot be at position 4? And at 5? Anyway, we have to avoid duplicate if the secret word has only one E? But we don't know.

But ""STEEL"" has S at 1 (which is allowed, since no problem), T at 2? That might be good? But we don't know if L is in the word.

Alternatively, how about ""SOLES"" but we avoid O? But O is allowed? But SOLES has S at 1 and 4? But we don't know about O, L. Also, E at position 4? But E at position 4 is not permitted? Actually, E at position 4 was already tried? But we know E is not at position 4? So if we put E at position 4, we expect a yellow? But that doesn't help? Better to put E in a position we haven't tried: 1,2, or 3.

So avoid position 4 for E.

Thus, ""SOLES"" is not great because E is at position 4.

Another word: ""POETS"" -> P, O, E, T, S -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:E, 4:T, 5:S. But S at position 5 is again the same as ""times""? We know S is not at 5? So we get a yellow for S? Better to avoid S at 5? So a word that has S at position 1,2,3, or 4.

Similarly, we have E at position 3: that hasn't been tried? In ""crane"" E was at 5, in ""times"" at 4, so position 3 for E is new.

Also, T at position 4: we tried T at position 1 in ""times"", and got yellow. Putting T at a different position.

So ""POETS"": S at 5 -> we expect yellow? But we could try to put S elsewhere.

Let me think of a word that has S at position 1, E at position 2, and T at position 4? For example, ""SEATS"" but we avoid A? And also S repeated?

How about ""QUEST"" -> Q, U, E, S, T. Positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:S, 5:T.

Now, this word: 
- Contains E, T, S (all required) and two new letters Q and U.
- Positions: E at 3 (new, not tried before), S at 4 (not at 5), T at 5 (which is allowed because we know T is present and not at 1, so it can be at 5? Yes).

We risk Q and U being absent? Possibly, but it tests E at 3 and T at 5.

But Q is uncommon. Maybe a better word?

Another word: ""TOWEL"" -> T at 1? But we must avoid T at position 1? Because in ""times"" T at 1 was yellow? So if we put T at 1, we expect yellow? So it's not efficient? Because we know it's wrong position.

Putting T at position 5: we haven't tried that.

Similarly, E at position 3? We haven't tried.

S at position 2? For example.

How about ""SLEPT"" -> S, L, E, P, T. Positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:E, 4:P, 5:T.

So:
- S at position 1: we haven't tested position 1 for S.
- L and P are new letters.
- E at position 3.
- T at position 5.

This avoids all forbidden letters and places E and T in new positions.

But S at 1? And we know S is present and not at 5? But position 1 is possible.

This is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""BLEST"" or ""BLETS""? Not sure? How about ""BELTS""? But S at 5? Not good.

""BELTS"": B E L T S -> E at 2? Which is new? But T at 4? And S at 5? We know S cannot be at 5? So we'll get a yellow for S? Which doesn't tell us anything new? But we are testing E at 2.

Also, ""BELTS"" has no forbidden letters.

But putting S at 5 when we know it's wrong seems wasteful? But it might be acceptable? Alternatively, we can avoid it.

Let me choose ""SLEPT"": 
It has S at position 1 (new position for S), E at position 3 (new position for E), T at position 5 (new position for T). We test L and P.

Additionally, it uses common consonants.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""SLEPT"".

But let's validate: S is at 1? We don't know? Maybe it is correct? If we get green for S at1, that would be great? Otherwise, we get yellow? But at least new position.

Similarly E at 3: if it is correct, green; else, yellow.

T at 5: same.

And we learn about L and P.

So, next guess: ""SLEPT"".

We return: <guess>slept</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, I, M (marked ""x"" in guesses).
- **Confirmed present letters**: E, T, S (all marked ""-"", meaning they are in the word but not in their guessed positions).
- **Position constraints**:
  - E is not in positions 4 or 5 (from ""times"" and ""crane"").
  - T is not in position 1 (from ""times"").
  - S is not in position 5 (from ""times"").

For the next guess:
- Prioritize testing E in new positions (1, 2, or 3) and S/T in untried positions to refine location data.
- Include E, T, S (since they are known to be present), plus two new untested letters.
- Avoid excluded letters.

A strong candidate is **""SLEPT""**:
- Places E at position 3 (untested location).
- Places S at position 1 and T at position 5 (both untested positions for these letters).
- Tests new common letters: L and P.
- Adheres to position constraints.

<guess>slept</guess>",slept,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word.
- E is in the secret word, but not in position 5 (where it was in ""crane"").

Second guess: ""times"" -> T(-) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(-)
Interpretation:
- T is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- I and M are not in the secret word.
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (since it's marked as present but wrong position).
- S is in the word but not in position 5.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains E, T, and S. But note: E is known from the first guess, and now we add T and S.
- Letters not present: C, R, A, N, I, M.
- We must find the positions for E, T, and S, and two more letters.

Additionally, from the feedback:
- E is not in position 4 (from ""times"") and not in position 5 (from ""crane""). So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- T is not in position 1 (from ""times""), so it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- S is not in position 5 (from ""times""), so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also have two positions still unknown and letters we haven't guessed.

We should avoid any letters that have been excluded: C, R, A, N, I, M.

Now, since we have E, T, S in the word, and we need two more letters, we can think of common English letters that haven't been tested: for example, B, D, G, H, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also need to consider the positions:

Let me denote the positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

E must be in 1,2, or 3.
T cannot be in 1.
S cannot be in 5.

Also, from the feedback of ""times"":
- At position 1: T is present (but wrong position), so position 1 of the secret word is not T. But we already know that.
- Position 4: E is present but wrong position? Actually, in ""times"", position 4 is E, and it's marked as present but wrong. Therefore, E is not at position 4.

But we already deduced that.

Now, note that the secret word has S, but in ""times"" it was at position 5? Actually, in ""times"", S is at position 5, and we got S(-) meaning S is present but not at position 5. So S is somewhere else.

Similarly, E was at position 4 in ""times"" and we got E(-), meaning E is not at position 4.

Also, T was at position 1 in ""times"" and we got T(-), meaning T is present but not at position 1.

Now, we must form a new guess that includes E, T, S and two new letters, avoiding C, R, A, N, I, M.

We also need to avoid placing T at position 1, S at position 5, and E at positions 4 or 5. And also, if we can, test E at a new position to narrow it down.

Currently, E has been tried at position 5 (in ""crane"") and position 4 (in ""times"") and both times it was present but wrong position. So E is either in 1, 2, or 3.

We can try to place E at position 1, for example? Or position 2 or 3.

Similarly, T and S can be placed in other positions.

But note: we might have constraints based on the feedback.

Let me try to think of words that start with E? Since E can be in position 1.

Example: ""EDGES"" but wait, we don't know G or D, and also E is repeated? But let's check the word: E, D, G, E, S. That's two E's and an S.

But we have an E at position 1 and position 4? And S at the end? But we know S cannot be at position 5? So if we put S at position 5, we expect it to be marked as absent? Not necessarily, because if the secret word also has an S at another position, then S at position 5 would be marked as absent only if there isn't a second S? Actually, Wordle-style feedback: for each letter, it marks it as green if correct position, yellow if present but wrong position, and gray if not present. If there are multiple same letters, each one is considered independently.

But note in our case: we already know S is in the word from ""times"", so if we put S at position 5 and it is the only S, but the secret word has S at another position, then S in position 5 would be marked as present? But that's not possible because the feedback only gives yellow if the letter is in the word but not in that position. So if the secret word has S, and we guess S at a position where it is not, then we get a yellow. But if we guess an extra S (more than the secret has), the extra would be gray? But in ""times"", we guessed one S at position 5, and it was yellow. So the secret word has exactly one S? Or more? Actually, no: it's unknown. It might have one or more. The yellow at position 5 means that there is an S in the word, but not at that position. So if there is already one S, then if we guess an S at position 5, and if there is no second S, it would be gray? Actually, I think the feedback per letter is:

The game checks each letter independently. For a given letter in the guess:
- If that specific position is correct, mark green.
- Otherwise, if the letter occurs anywhere else in the word and that occurrence has not been accounted for, mark yellow.
- Otherwise, gray.

But for each instance, so in ""times"", S is at the end and marked yellow. That means that S is in the secret word, but not at position 5, and also, there is at least one other occurrence of S? Or not? Actually, the secret word could have exactly one S, but it's at a different position. So when we guess S at position 5, since it's not correct, and since there is an S at say position 2, then we get a yellow.

So the number of yellows and grays per letter depends on the count.

Now, back to our case: we know S is in the word, and not at position 5. Similarly, E is in the word, not at positions 4 or 5.

For our next guess, we should try to put E at a new position (like position 1 or 2 or 3) to test, and similarly for T and S.

We can also try to avoid positions that are known wrong.

I think we have enough information to start forming a word. Let's list the available letters: besides E, T, S, we want two new letters. Common letters left: O, L, B, D, G, H, K, P, U, W, Y.

We should choose a word that:
- Contains E, T, S, and two new letters.
- Positions: E not at 4 or 5, T not at 1, S not at 5.

Also, we can try to put E at position 1 or 2? For example, if we start with E, then we can see if it is green.

Possible word: ""ENTRY"" but we know N is excluded and R is excluded. Not possible.

Another word: ""BELTS"" -> but B, E, L, T, S. Positions: E at 2, T at 4, S at 5? But we know S cannot be at position 5? And we are putting S at 5? That might not be good because we know it's not there. Also, if we put S at 5 and the secret word does have S at position 5? But the feedback for ""times"" said S is not at 5? Yes, because ""times"" had S at 5 and got a yellow. But in Wordle, if the secret word doesn't have S at 5, then when we guess S at 5 we get yellow? But in this case, we know that S is in the word but not at position 5, so we should avoid placing S at 5? Not necessarily, because if we do, it will be marked yellow again? But that doesn't give us new information? Actually, it would be redundant. So to maximize information, we should place S at a position where it might be correct.

Similarly for T: we know T is not at position 1, and it could be at 2,3,4,5.

Similarly for E: positions 1,2,3.

So let's try to put S in position 1, for example? Or position 2 or 3 or 4.

Similarly, T should not be at 1.

And E at 1,2, or 3.

Possible word: ""STEEL"" but wait, that has two E's? Also, L is a possible letter. But ""STEEL"" has S at 1, T at 2, E at 3 and 4? But we know E cannot be at position 4? And at 5? Anyway, we have to avoid duplicate if the secret word has only one E? But we don't know.

But ""STEEL"" has S at 1 (which is allowed, since no problem), T at 2? That might be good? But we don't know if L is in the word.

Alternatively, how about ""SOLES"" but we avoid O? But O is allowed? But SOLES has S at 1 and 4? But we don't know about O, L. Also, E at position 4? But E at position 4 is not permitted? Actually, E at position 4 was already tried? But we know E is not at position 4? So if we put E at position 4, we expect a yellow? But that doesn't help? Better to put E in a position we haven't tried: 1,2, or 3.

So avoid position 4 for E.

Thus, ""SOLES"" is not great because E is at position 4.

Another word: ""POETS"" -> P, O, E, T, S -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:E, 4:T, 5:S. But S at position 5 is again the same as ""times""? We know S is not at 5? So we get a yellow for S? Better to avoid S at 5? So a word that has S at position 1,2,3, or 4.

Similarly, we have E at position 3: that hasn't been tried? In ""crane"" E was at 5, in ""times"" at 4, so position 3 for E is new.

Also, T at position 4: we tried T at position 1 in ""times"", and got yellow. Putting T at a different position.

So ""POETS"": S at 5 -> we expect yellow? But we could try to put S elsewhere.

Let me think of a word that has S at position 1, E at position 2, and T at position 4? For example, ""SEATS"" but we avoid A? And also S repeated?

How about ""QUEST"" -> Q, U, E, S, T. Positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:S, 5:T.

Now, this word: 
- Contains E, T, S (all required) and two new letters Q and U.
- Positions: E at 3 (new, not tried before), S at 4 (not at 5), T at 5 (which is allowed because we know T is present and not at 1, so it can be at 5? Yes).

We risk Q and U being absent? Possibly, but it tests E at 3 and T at 5.

But Q is uncommon. Maybe a better word?

Another word: ""TOWEL"" -> T at 1? But we must avoid T at position 1? Because in ""times"" T at 1 was yellow? So if we put T at 1, we expect yellow? So it's not efficient? Because we know it's wrong position.

Putting T at position 5: we haven't tried that.

Similarly, E at position 3? We haven't tried.

S at position 2? For example.

How about ""SLEPT"" -> S, L, E, P, T. Positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:E, 4:P, 5:T.

So:
- S at position 1: we haven't tested position 1 for S.
- L and P are new letters.
- E at position 3.
- T at position 5.

This avoids all forbidden letters and places E and T in new positions.

But S at 1? And we know S is present and not at 5? But position 1 is possible.

This is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""BLEST"" or ""BLETS""? Not sure? How about ""BELTS""? But S at 5? Not good.

""BELTS"": B E L T S -> E at 2? Which is new? But T at 4? And S at 5? We know S cannot be at 5? So we'll get a yellow for S? Which doesn't tell us anything new? But we are testing E at 2.

Also, ""BELTS"" has no forbidden letters.

But putting S at 5 when we know it's wrong seems wasteful? But it might be acceptable? Alternatively, we can avoid it.

Let me choose ""SLEPT"": 
It has S at position 1 (new position for S), E at position 3 (new position for E), T at position 5 (new position for T). We test L and P.

Additionally, it uses common consonants.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""SLEPT"".

But let's validate: S is at 1? We don't know? Maybe it is correct? If we get green for S at1, that would be great? Otherwise, we get yellow? But at least new position.

Similarly E at 3: if it is correct, green; else, yellow.

T at 5: same.

And we learn about L and P.

So, next guess: ""SLEPT"".

We return: <guess>slept</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, I, M (marked ""x"" in guesses).

- **Position constraints**:

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,swept,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - The letter 'E' is in the secret word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"", E is the last letter and we got a '-', meaning it's present but in the wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'E' but not in the 5th position, and it does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Since we know the secret word has 5 letters and contains an 'E' (but not at the end), we can try to think of words that have an 'E' in one of the first four positions.

 Also, we must avoid using the letters C, R, A, N.

 We have 6 tries, so we can use this second guess to test more common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: 
 Vowels: We have E (already known to be present), but we don't know about others. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). 
 Consonants: We have many: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has an 'E' that is not in the 5th position. So it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Since we don't have much information, we should choose a word that:
 1. Contains the letter 'E' (to confirm its position and because we know it's in the word).
 2. Uses other common letters that we haven't tried (so avoid C, R, A, N).

 Let's try to pick a word that has 'E' in a different position and includes other common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

 Example: We could try ""TIMES"", but note that we have to avoid A and R (which we are avoiding, and in ""TIMES"" we don't have A or R). However, we have to check the letters: T, I, M, E, S.

 But wait: we don't know if T, I, M, S are in the word. This guess would help us test those.

 However, note that the feedback for the first guess told us that E is present but not at the end. In ""TIMES"", E is at the 4th position and S at the end. If we get feedback that E is now in the correct position, then we know it's the 4th. Otherwise, if it's still in the wrong position, then we know it must be in 1, 2, or 3.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts E in the first position? But that might be less common.

 Another idea: use a word that has E in the second position? Like ""LEAST"" but we cannot use A (since A is not in the word). So we must avoid A.

 Let's think of words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5.

 Some options:
 - ""BELIE"": but that has 5 letters? Actually, ""BELIE"" is 5 letters. But it has two E's? Actually, it ends with E, but we know E is not at the end? So we cannot put E at the end. So we must avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, we need a word that has E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, and does not have C, R, A, N.

 Let me list some words:
 - Position 1: ""EAGLE"" -> but has A (forbidden) and ends with E (which we know is not the position for E? Actually, we know E is not at the end, so we can have E at the beginning and then another E at the end? But the feedback only said one E is present? Actually, the feedback for the first guess: we had one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. It doesn't say there is only one E. So there could be multiple E's? But in the feedback, only one E was in the word? Actually, the feedback symbol is per letter. In ""crane"", we had one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. So at least one E is in the word. There could be more.

 However, we don't know. So we have to consider that possibility.

 But to be safe, let's avoid using two E's for now? We can use one E in a different position.

 Another word: ""TIMES"" has E at the 4th position and S at the end. But we don't know if S is in the word. Also, we are testing T, I, M, S.

 But note: we are allowed to use any valid English word. And we are trying to get as much information as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPIEL"" (which has E at the 4th position) but that's 5 letters? Yes. And it doesn't contain C, R, A, N. But it has S, P, I, E, L.

 However, we don't know if S, P, I, L are in the word.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but ends with E, which we know is not the position for the E we found? Actually, we know that the E we found (from the first guess) is not at the end. But if the word has two E's, then one could be at the end? But the feedback only showed one E as present. So if the secret word has an E at the end, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has E at the end) we would have gotten a check for that E? But we got a '-' meaning that the E is in the word but not at the end. So the secret word does not have an E at the end. Therefore, we must avoid putting E at the end in our guesses? Actually, we can put E at the end to test, but we know that the secret word does not have E at the end. So if we put E at the end and it is marked as absent, that would be consistent. But if it is marked as present, that would mean there is another E? But we don't know.

 However, to maximize information, we should avoid the end for E because we know the E we found is not at the end. So we should try to put E in one of the first four positions, but not the same as in ""crane"" (which was position 5). In ""crane"", E was at position 5, so we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4.

 Let me choose a word that has E in the second position? For example, ""LEMON"" -> but we cannot use A, R, and also we are avoiding C, R, A, N? L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden (we got N(x) in the first feedback). So we cannot use N.

 So we must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Therefore, let's try to pick a word without those and with E in a new position.

 I think ""TIMES"" is a good candidate because:
 - It has E in the 4th position (which is different from the 5th and we can see if that's the correct spot).
 - It uses T, I, M, S which are common and we haven't tested.

 But note: we are not sure if the secret word has E only once. If it has two E's, then we might get more feedback.

 Alternatively, we can try ""BELTS"": 
 - B, E, L, T, S -> E is in the second position. And we avoid C, R, A, N.

 But we don't know if B, L, T, S are in the word.

 Another option: ""DUVET"" -> but ends with T? Actually, D, U, V, E, T -> E is in the 4th position? Actually, positions: 1:D, 2:U, 3:V, 4:E, 5:T. So E is at 4. But we don't know if D, U, V, T are in the word. Also, ""DUVET"" is a valid word.

 However, I think ""TIMES"" is more common and uses more common letters.

 But wait: we have to consider that the secret word does not have A, R, C, N. So words without those are acceptable.

 Let me go with ""TIMES"".

 So my second guess is ""TIMES"".

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

 But note: if the secret word has E in the 4th position, then in ""TIMES"" the E would be marked as correct (✓). If not, then it would be marked as present but wrong position (-) or absent (x). But we know E is in the word, so it won't be absent. So we'll get either ✓ or - for E.

 Also, we'll get information about T, I, M, S.

 Let's write it in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Include E in a position other than the 5th (positions 1–4) to test its correct location.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, M) to maximize new information.

A strong second guess is **""TIMES""** because:
- It includes E in the 4th position (testing if E belongs there).
- It uses new common letters (T, I, M, S) not yet tested.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

<guess>times</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word.
- E is in the secret word, but not in position 5 (where it was in ""crane"").

Second guess: ""times"" -> T(-) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(-)
Interpretation:
- T is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- I and M are not in the secret word.
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (since it's marked as present but wrong position).
- S is in the word but not in position 5.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains E, T, and S. But note: E is known from the first guess, and now we add T and S.
- Letters not present: C, R, A, N, I, M.
- We must find the positions for E, T, and S, and two more letters.

Additionally, from the feedback:
- E is not in position 4 (from ""times"") and not in position 5 (from ""crane""). So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- T is not in position 1 (from ""times""), so it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- S is not in position 5 (from ""times""), so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also have two positions still unknown and letters we haven't guessed.

We should avoid any letters that have been excluded: C, R, A, N, I, M.

Now, since we have E, T, S in the word, and we need two more letters, we can think of common English letters that haven't been tested: for example, B, D, G, H, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also need to consider the positions:

Let me denote the positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

E must be in 1,2, or 3.
T cannot be in 1.
S cannot be in 5.

Also, from the feedback of ""times"":
- At position 1: T is present (but wrong position), so position 1 of the secret word is not T. But we already know that.
- Position 4: E is present but wrong position? Actually, in ""times"", position 4 is E, and it's marked as present but wrong. Therefore, E is not at position 4.

But we already deduced that.

Now, note that the secret word has S, but in ""times"" it was at position 5? Actually, in ""times"", S is at position 5, and we got S(-) meaning S is present but not at position 5. So S is somewhere else.

Similarly, E was at position 4 in ""times"" and we got E(-), meaning E is not at position 4.

Also, T was at position 1 in ""times"" and we got T(-), meaning T is present but not at position 1.

Now, we must form a new guess that includes E, T, S and two new letters, avoiding C, R, A, N, I, M.

We also need to avoid placing T at position 1, S at position 5, and E at positions 4 or 5. And also, if we can, test E at a new position to narrow it down.

Currently, E has been tried at position 5 (in ""crane"") and position 4 (in ""times"") and both times it was present but wrong position. So E is either in 1, 2, or 3.

We can try to place E at position 1, for example? Or position 2 or 3.

Similarly, T and S can be placed in other positions.

But note: we might have constraints based on the feedback.

Let me try to think of words that start with E? Since E can be in position 1.

Example: ""EDGES"" but wait, we don't know G or D, and also E is repeated? But let's check the word: E, D, G, E, S. That's two E's and an S.

But we have an E at position 1 and position 4? And S at the end? But we know S cannot be at position 5? So if we put S at position 5, we expect it to be marked as absent? Not necessarily, because if the secret word also has an S at another position, then S at position 5 would be marked as absent only if there isn't a second S? Actually, Wordle-style feedback: for each letter, it marks it as green if correct position, yellow if present but wrong position, and gray if not present. If there are multiple same letters, each one is considered independently.

But note in our case: we already know S is in the word from ""times"", so if we put S at position 5 and it is the only S, but the secret word has S at another position, then S in position 5 would be marked as present? But that's not possible because the feedback only gives yellow if the letter is in the word but not in that position. So if the secret word has S, and we guess S at a position where it is not, then we get a yellow. But if we guess an extra S (more than the secret has), the extra would be gray? But in ""times"", we guessed one S at position 5, and it was yellow. So the secret word has exactly one S? Or more? Actually, no: it's unknown. It might have one or more. The yellow at position 5 means that there is an S in the word, but not at that position. So if there is already one S, then if we guess an S at position 5, and if there is no second S, it would be gray? Actually, I think the feedback per letter is:

The game checks each letter independently. For a given letter in the guess:
- If that specific position is correct, mark green.
- Otherwise, if the letter occurs anywhere else in the word and that occurrence has not been accounted for, mark yellow.
- Otherwise, gray.

But for each instance, so in ""times"", S is at the end and marked yellow. That means that S is in the secret word, but not at position 5, and also, there is at least one other occurrence of S? Or not? Actually, the secret word could have exactly one S, but it's at a different position. So when we guess S at position 5, since it's not correct, and since there is an S at say position 2, then we get a yellow.

So the number of yellows and grays per letter depends on the count.

Now, back to our case: we know S is in the word, and not at position 5. Similarly, E is in the word, not at positions 4 or 5.

For our next guess, we should try to put E at a new position (like position 1 or 2 or 3) to test, and similarly for T and S.

We can also try to avoid positions that are known wrong.

I think we have enough information to start forming a word. Let's list the available letters: besides E, T, S, we want two new letters. Common letters left: O, L, B, D, G, H, K, P, U, W, Y.

We should choose a word that:
- Contains E, T, S, and two new letters.
- Positions: E not at 4 or 5, T not at 1, S not at 5.

Also, we can try to put E at position 1 or 2? For example, if we start with E, then we can see if it is green.

Possible word: ""ENTRY"" but we know N is excluded and R is excluded. Not possible.

Another word: ""BELTS"" -> but B, E, L, T, S. Positions: E at 2, T at 4, S at 5? But we know S cannot be at position 5? And we are putting S at 5? That might not be good because we know it's not there. Also, if we put S at 5 and the secret word does have S at position 5? But the feedback for ""times"" said S is not at 5? Yes, because ""times"" had S at 5 and got a yellow. But in Wordle, if the secret word doesn't have S at 5, then when we guess S at 5 we get yellow? But in this case, we know that S is in the word but not at position 5, so we should avoid placing S at 5? Not necessarily, because if we do, it will be marked yellow again? But that doesn't give us new information? Actually, it would be redundant. So to maximize information, we should place S at a position where it might be correct.

Similarly for T: we know T is not at position 1, and it could be at 2,3,4,5.

Similarly for E: positions 1,2,3.

So let's try to put S in position 1, for example? Or position 2 or 3 or 4.

Similarly, T should not be at 1.

And E at 1,2, or 3.

Possible word: ""STEEL"" but wait, that has two E's? Also, L is a possible letter. But ""STEEL"" has S at 1, T at 2, E at 3 and 4? But we know E cannot be at position 4? And at 5? Anyway, we have to avoid duplicate if the secret word has only one E? But we don't know.

But ""STEEL"" has S at 1 (which is allowed, since no problem), T at 2? That might be good? But we don't know if L is in the word.

Alternatively, how about ""SOLES"" but we avoid O? But O is allowed? But SOLES has S at 1 and 4? But we don't know about O, L. Also, E at position 4? But E at position 4 is not permitted? Actually, E at position 4 was already tried? But we know E is not at position 4? So if we put E at position 4, we expect a yellow? But that doesn't help? Better to put E in a position we haven't tried: 1,2, or 3.

So avoid position 4 for E.

Thus, ""SOLES"" is not great because E is at position 4.

Another word: ""POETS"" -> P, O, E, T, S -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:E, 4:T, 5:S. But S at position 5 is again the same as ""times""? We know S is not at 5? So we get a yellow for S? Better to avoid S at 5? So a word that has S at position 1,2,3, or 4.

Similarly, we have E at position 3: that hasn't been tried? In ""crane"" E was at 5, in ""times"" at 4, so position 3 for E is new.

Also, T at position 4: we tried T at position 1 in ""times"", and got yellow. Putting T at a different position.

So ""POETS"": S at 5 -> we expect yellow? But we could try to put S elsewhere.

Let me think of a word that has S at position 1, E at position 2, and T at position 4? For example, ""SEATS"" but we avoid A? And also S repeated?

How about ""QUEST"" -> Q, U, E, S, T. Positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:S, 5:T.

Now, this word: 
- Contains E, T, S (all required) and two new letters Q and U.
- Positions: E at 3 (new, not tried before), S at 4 (not at 5), T at 5 (which is allowed because we know T is present and not at 1, so it can be at 5? Yes).

We risk Q and U being absent? Possibly, but it tests E at 3 and T at 5.

But Q is uncommon. Maybe a better word?

Another word: ""TOWEL"" -> T at 1? But we must avoid T at position 1? Because in ""times"" T at 1 was yellow? So if we put T at 1, we expect yellow? So it's not efficient? Because we know it's wrong position.

Putting T at position 5: we haven't tried that.

Similarly, E at position 3? We haven't tried.

S at position 2? For example.

How about ""SLEPT"" -> S, L, E, P, T. Positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:E, 4:P, 5:T.

So:
- S at position 1: we haven't tested position 1 for S.
- L and P are new letters.
- E at position 3.
- T at position 5.

This avoids all forbidden letters and places E and T in new positions.

But S at 1? And we know S is present and not at 5? But position 1 is possible.

This is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""BLEST"" or ""BLETS""? Not sure? How about ""BELTS""? But S at 5? Not good.

""BELTS"": B E L T S -> E at 2? Which is new? But T at 4? And S at 5? We know S cannot be at 5? So we'll get a yellow for S? Which doesn't tell us anything new? But we are testing E at 2.

Also, ""BELTS"" has no forbidden letters.

But putting S at 5 when we know it's wrong seems wasteful? But it might be acceptable? Alternatively, we can avoid it.

Let me choose ""SLEPT"": 
It has S at position 1 (new position for S), E at position 3 (new position for E), T at position 5 (new position for T). We test L and P.

Additionally, it uses common consonants.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""SLEPT"".

But let's validate: S is at 1? We don't know? Maybe it is correct? If we get green for S at1, that would be great? Otherwise, we get yellow? But at least new position.

Similarly E at 3: if it is correct, green; else, yellow.

T at 5: same.

And we learn about L and P.

So, next guess: ""SLEPT"".

We return: <guess>slept</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, I, M (marked ""x"" in guesses).
- **Confirmed present letters**: E, T, S (all marked ""-"", meaning they are in the word but not in their guessed positions).
- **Position constraints**:
  - E is not in positions 4 or 5 (from ""times"" and ""crane"").
  - T is not in position 1 (from ""times"").
  - S is not in position 5 (from ""times"").

For the next guess:
- Prioritize testing E in new positions (1, 2, or 3) and S/T in untried positions to refine location data.
- Include E, T, S (since they are known to be present), plus two new untested letters.
- Avoid excluded letters.

A strong candidate is **""SLEPT""**:
- Places E at position 3 (untested location).
- Places S at position 1 and T at position 5 (both untested positions for these letters).
- Tests new common letters: L and P.
- Adheres to position constraints.

The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). \n Consonants: We have many: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We also know that the word has an \'E\' that is not in the 5th position. So it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Since we don\'t have much information, we should choose a word that:\n 1. Contains the letter \'E\' (to confirm its position and because we know it\'s in the word).\n 2. Uses other common letters that we haven\'t tried (so avoid C, R, A, N).\n\n Let\'s try to pick a word that has \'E\' in a different position and includes other common consonants like T, S, L, etc.\n\n Example: We could try ""TIMES"", but note that we have to avoid A and R (which we are avoiding, and in ""TIMES"" we don\'t have A or R). However, we have to check the letters: T, I, M, E, S.\n\n But wait: we don\'t know if T, I, M, S are in the word. This guess would help us test those.\n\n However, note that the feedback for the first guess told us that E is present but not at the end. In ""TIMES"", E is at the 4th position and S at the end. If we get feedback that E is now in the correct position, then we know it\'s the 4th. Otherwise, if it\'s still in the wrong position, then we know it must be in 1, 2, or 3.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that puts E in the first position? But that might be less common.\n\n Another idea: use a word that has E in the second position? Like ""LEAST"" but we cannot use A (since A is not in the word). So we must avoid A.\n\n Let\'s think of words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5.\n\n Some options:\n - ""BELIE"": but that has 5 letters? Actually, ""BELIE"" is 5 letters. But it has two E\'s? Actually, it ends with E, but we know E is not at the end? So we cannot put E at the end. So we must avoid putting E at the end.\n\n Therefore, we need a word that has E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, and does not have C, R, A, N.\n\n Let me list some words:\n - Position 1: ""EAGLE"" -> but has A (forbidden) and ends with E (which we know is not the position for E? Actually, we know E is not at the end, so we can have E at the beginning and then another E at the end? But the feedback only said one E is present? Actually, the feedback for the first guess: we had one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. It doesn\'t say there is only one E. So there could be multiple E\'s? But in the feedback, only one E was in the word? Actually, the feedback symbol is per letter. In ""crane"", we had one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. So at least one E is in the word. There could be more.\n\n However, we don\'t know. So we have to consider that possibility.\n\n But to be safe, let\'s avoid using two E\'s for now? We can use one E in a different position.\n\n Another word: ""TIMES"" has E at the 4th position and S at the end. But we don\'t know if S is in the word. Also, we are testing T, I, M, S.\n\n But note: we are allowed to use any valid English word. And we are trying to get as much information as possible.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SPIEL"" (which has E at the 4th position) but that\'s 5 letters? Yes. And it doesn\'t contain C, R, A, N. But it has S, P, I, E, L.\n\n However, we don\'t know if S, P, I, L are in the word.\n\n Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but ends with E, which we know is not the position for the E we found? Actually, we know that the E we found (from the first guess) is not at the end. But if the word has two E\'s, then one could be at the end? But the feedback only showed one E as present. So if the secret word has an E at the end, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has E at the end) we would have gotten a check for that E? But we got a \'-\' meaning that the E is in the word but not at the end. So the secret word does not have an E at the end. Therefore, we must avoid putting E at the end in our guesses? Actually, we can put E at the end to test, but we know that the secret word does not have E at the end. So if we put E at the end and it is marked as absent, that would be consistent. But if it is marked as present, that would mean there is another E? But we don\'t know.\n\n However, to maximize information, we should avoid the end for E because we know the E we found is not at the end. So we should try to put E in one of the first four positions, but not the same as in ""crane"" (which was position 5). In ""crane"", E was at position 5, so we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n Let me choose a word that has E in the second position? For example, ""LEMON"" -> but we cannot use A, R, and also we are avoiding C, R, A, N? L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden (we got N(x) in the first feedback). So we cannot use N.\n\n So we must avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n Therefore, let\'s try to pick a word without those and with E in a new position.\n\n I think ""TIMES"" is a good candidate because:\n - It has E in the 4th position (which is different from the 5th and we can see if that\'s the correct spot).\n - It uses T, I, M, S which are common and we haven\'t tested.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the secret word has E only once. If it has two E\'s, then we might get more feedback.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""BELTS"": \n - B, E, L, T, S -> E is in the second position. And we avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n But we don\'t know if B, L, T, S are in the word.\n\n Another option: ""DUVET"" -> but ends with T? Actually, D, U, V, E, T -> E is in the 4th position? Actually, positions: 1:D, 2:U, 3:V, 4:E, 5:T. So E is at 4. But we don\'t know if D, U, V, T are in the word. Also, ""DUVET"" is a valid word.\n\n However, I think ""TIMES"" is more common and uses more common letters.\n\n But wait: we have to consider that the secret word does not have A, R, C, N. So words without those are acceptable.\n\n Let me go with ""TIMES"".\n\n So my second guess is ""TIMES"".\n\n We\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\n But note: if the secret word has E in the 4th position, then in ""TIMES"" the E would be marked as correct (✓). If not, then it would be marked as present but wrong position (-) or absent (x). But we know E is in the word, so it won\'t be absent. So we\'ll get either ✓ or - for E.\n\n Also, we\'ll get information about T, I, M, S.\n\n Let\'s write it in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.\n- Include E in a position other than the 5th (positions 1–4) to test its correct location.\n- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, M) to maximize new information.\n\nA strong second guess is **""TIMES""** because:\n- It includes E in the 4th position (testing if E belongs there).\n- It uses new common letters (T, I, M, S) not yet tested.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).\n\n<guess>times</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nInterpretation:\n- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word.\n- E is in the secret word, but not in position 5 (where it was in ""crane"").\n\nSecond guess: ""times"" -> T(-) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(-)\nInterpretation:\n- T is in the secret word but not in position 1.\n- I and M are not in the secret word.\n- E is in the word but not in position 4 (since it\'s marked as present but wrong position).\n- S is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The secret word contains E, T, and S.

But we already know that.\n- Position 4: E is present but wrong position? Actually, in ""times"", position 4 is E, and it\'s marked as present but wrong. Therefore, E is not at position 4.\n\nBut we already deduced that.\n\nNow, note that the secret word has S, but in ""times"" it was at position 5? Actually, in ""times"", S is at position 5, and we got S(-) meaning S is present but not at position 5. So S is somewhere else.\n\nSimilarly, E was at position 4 in ""times"" and we got E(-), meaning E is not at position 4.\n\nAlso, T was at position 1 in ""times"" and we got T(-), meaning T is present but not at position 1.\n\nNow, we must form a new guess that includes E, T, S and two new letters, avoiding C, R, A, N, I, M.\n\nWe also need to avoid placing T at position 1, S at position 5, and E at positions 4 or 5. And also, if we can, test E at a new position to narrow it down.\n\nCurrently, E has been tried at position 5 (in ""crane"") and position 4 (in ""times"") and both times it was present but wrong position. So E is either in 1, 2, or 3.\n\nWe can try to place E at position 1, for example? Or position 2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, T and S can be placed in other positions.\n\nBut note: we might have constraints based on the feedback.\n\nLet me try to think of words that start with E? Since E can be in position 1.\n\nExample: ""EDGES"" but wait, we don\'t know G or D, and also E is repeated? But let\'s check the word: E, D, G, E, S. That\'s two E\'s and an S.\n\nBut we have an E at position 1 and position 4? And S at the end? But we know S cannot be at position 5? So if we put S at position 5, we expect it to be marked as absent? Not necessarily, because if the secret word also has an S at another position, then S at position 5 would be marked as absent only if there isn\'t a second S? Actually, Wordle-style feedback: for each letter, it marks it as green if correct position, yellow if present but wrong position, and gray if not present. If there are multiple same letters, each one is considered independently.\n\nBut note in our case: we already know S is in the word from ""times"", so if we put S at position 5 and it is the only S, but the secret word has S at another position, then S in position 5 would be marked as present? But that\'s not possible because the feedback only gives yellow if the letter is in the word but not in that position. So if the secret word has S, and we guess S at a position where it is not, then we get a yellow. But if we guess an extra S (more than the secret has), the extra would be gray? But in ""times"", we guessed one S at position 5, and it was yellow. So the secret word has exactly one S? Or more? Actually, no: it\'s unknown. It might have one or more. The yellow at position 5 means that there is an S in the word, but not at that position. So if there is already one S, then if we guess an S at position 5, and if there is no second S, it would be gray? Actually, I think the feedback per letter is:\n\nThe game checks each letter independently. For a given letter in the guess:\n- If that specific position is correct, mark green.\n- Otherwise, if the letter occurs anywhere else in the word and that occurrence has not been accounted for, mark yellow.\n- Otherwise, gray.\n\nBut for each instance, so in ""times"", S is at the end and marked yellow. That means that S is in the secret word, but not at position 5, and also, there is at least one other occurrence of S? Or not? Actually, the secret word could have exactly one S, but it\'s at a different position. So when we guess S at position 5, since it\'s not correct, and since there is an S at say position 2, then we get a yellow.\n\nSo the number of yellows and grays per letter depends on the count.\n\nNow, back to our case: we know S is in the word, and not at position 5. Similarly, E is in the word, not at positions 4 or 5.\n\nFor our next guess, we should try to put E at a new position (like position 1 or 2 or 3) to test, and similarly for T and S.\n\nWe can also try to avoid positions that are known wrong.\n\nI think we have enough information to start forming a word. Let\'s list the available letters: besides E, T, S, we want two new letters. Common letters left: O, L, B, D, G, H, K, P, U, W, Y.\n\nWe should choose a word that:\n- Contains E, T, S, and two new letters.\n- Positions: E not at 4 or 5, T not at 1, S not at 5.\n\nAlso, we can try to put E at position 1 or 2? For example, if we start with E, then we can see if it is green.\n\nPossible word: ""ENTRY"" but we know N is excluded and R is excluded. Not possible.\n\nAnother word: ""BELTS"" -> but B, E, L, T, S. Positions: E at 2, T at 4, S at 5? But we know S cannot be at position 5? And we are putting S at 5? That might not be good because we know it\'s not there. Also, if we put S at 5 and the secret word does have S at position 5? But the feedback for ""times"" said S is not at 5? Yes, because ""times"" had S at 5 and got a yellow. But in Wordle, if the secret word doesn\'t have S at 5, then when we guess S at 5 we get yellow? But in this case, we know that S is in the word but not at position 5, so we should avoid placing S at 5? Not necessarily, because if we do, it will be marked yellow again? But that doesn\'t give us new information? Actually, it would be redundant. So to maximize information, we should place S at a position where it might be correct.\n\nSimilarly for T: we know T is not at position 1, and it could be at 2,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly for E: positions 1,2,3.\n\nSo let\'s try to put S in position 1, for example? Or position 2 or 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, T should not be at 1.\n\nAnd E at 1,2, or 3.\n\nPossible word: ""STEEL"" but wait, that has two E\'s? Also, L is a possible letter. But ""STEEL"" has S at 1, T at 2, E at 3 and 4? But we know E cannot be at position 4? And at 5? Anyway, we have to avoid duplicate if the secret word has only one E? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut ""STEEL"" has S at 1 (which is allowed, since no problem), T at 2? That might be good? But we don\'t know if L is in the word.\n\nAlternatively, how about ""SOLES"" but we avoid O? But O is allowed? But SOLES has S at 1 and 4? But we don\'t know about O, L. Also, E at position 4? But E at position 4 is not permitted? Actually, E at position 4 was already tried? But we know E is not at position 4? So if we put E at position 4, we expect a yellow? But that doesn\'t help? Better to put E in a position we haven\'t tried: 1,2, or 3.\n\nSo avoid position 4 for E.\n\nThus, ""SOLES"" is not great because E is at position 4.\n\nAnother word: ""POETS"" -> P, O, E, T, S -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:E, 4:T, 5:S. But S at position 5 is again the same as ""times""? We know S is not at 5? So we get a yellow for S? Better to avoid S at 5? So a word that has S at position 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, we have E at position 3: that hasn\'t been tried? In ""crane"" E was at 5, in ""times"" at 4, so position 3 for E is new.\n\nAlso, T at position 4: we tried T at position 1 in ""times"", and got yellow. Putting T at a different position.\n\nSo ""POETS"": S at 5 -> we expect yellow? But we could try to put S elsewhere.\n\nLet me think of a word that has S at position 1, E at position 2, and T at position 4? For example, ""SEATS"" but we avoid A? And also S repeated?\n\nHow about ""QUEST"" -> Q, U, E, S, T. Positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:S, 5:T.\n\nNow, this word: \n- Contains E, T, S (all required) and two new letters Q and U.\n- Positions: E at 3 (new, not tried before), S at 4 (not at 5), T at 5 (which is allowed because we know T is present and not at 1, so it can be at 5? Yes).\n\nWe risk Q and U being absent? Possibly, but it tests E at 3 and T at 5.\n\nBut Q is uncommon. Maybe a better word?\n\nAnother word: ""TOWEL"" -> T at 1? But we must avoid T at position 1? Because in ""times"" T at 1 was yellow? So if we put T at 1, we expect yellow? So it\'s not efficient? Because we know it\'s wrong position.\n\nPutting T at position 5: we haven\'t tried that.\n\nSimilarly, E at position 3? We haven\'t tried.\n\nS at position 2? For example.\n\nHow about ""SLEPT"" -> S, L, E, P, T. Positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:E, 4:P, 5:T.\n\nSo:\n- S at position 1: we haven\'t tested position 1 for S.\n- L and P are new letters.\n- E at position 3.\n- T at position 5.\n\nThis avoids all forbidden letters and places E and T in new positions.\n\nBut S at 1? And we know S is present and not at 5? But position 1 is possible.\n\nThis is a valid word.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BLEST"" or ""BLETS""? Not sure? How about ""BELTS""? But S at 5? Not good.\n\n""BELTS"": B E L T S -> E at 2? Which is new? But T at 4? And S at 5? We know S cannot be at 5? So we\'ll get a yellow for S? Which doesn\'t tell us anything new? But we are testing E at 2.\n\nAlso, ""BELTS"" has no forbidden letters.\n\nBut putting S at 5 when we know it\'s wrong seems wasteful? But it might be acceptable? Alternatively, we can avoid it.\n\nLet me choose ""SLEPT"": \nIt has S at position 1 (new position for S), E at position 3 (new position for E), T at position 5 (new position for T). We test L and P.\n\nAdditionally, it uses common consonants.\n\nSo I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""SLEPT"".\n\nBut let\'s validate: S is at 1? We don\'t know? Maybe it is correct? If we get green for S at1, that would be great? Otherwise, we get yellow? But at least new position.\n\nSimilarly E at 3: if it is correct, green; else, yellow.\n\nT at 5: same.\n\nAnd we learn about L and P.\n\nSo, next guess: ""SLEPT"".\n\nWe return: <guess>slept</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, I, M (marked ""x"" in guesses).\n- **Confirmed present letters**: E, T, S (all marked ""-"", meaning they are in the word but not in their guessed positions).\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - E is not in positions 4 or 5 (from ""times"" and ""crane"").\n  - T is not in position 1 (from ""times"").\n  - S is not in position 5 (from ""times"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Prioritize testing E in new positions (1, 2, or 3) and S/T in untried positions to refine location data.\n- Include E, T, S (since they are known to be present), plus two new untested letters.\n- Avoid excluded letters.\n\nA strong candidate is **""SLEPT""**:\n- Places E at position 3 (untested location).\n- Places S at position 1 and T at position 5 (both untested positions for these letters).\n- Tests new common letters: L and P.\n- Adheres to position constraints.\n\n<guess>slept</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(-)\nGuess 3: slept -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) E(✓) P(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the third guess ""slept"":
- S(✓) : S is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- L(x) : L is not in the word.
- E(✓) : E is correct and in the right position (position 3).
- P(✓) : P is correct and in the right position (position 4).
- T(✓) : T is correct and in the right position (position 5).

So the secret word has:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: P
- Position 5: T

And we know that L is not in the word.

Also, from previous guesses, we know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, I, M, and now L.

We are missing position 2. And we know the letter at position 2 must be one that hasn't been excluded and is not S, E, P, T (since those are already placed).

We also know from the first guess that E is in the word (which we now know is at position 3) and from the second guess that T and S are in the word (now at positions 1 and 5).

The missing letter (position 2) must be a letter that:
- Is not in the excluded list: C, R, A, N, I, M, L.
- And not S, E, P, T.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we have S _ E P T.

We need to find a letter for the second position that makes a valid English word.

Let's list possible letters that are not excluded and not used. Excluded: C, R, A, N, I, M, L. Used: S, E, P, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, what letters can fit in the second position to form a word? We need a word of the form S? E P T.

Common English words that fit this pattern:

- SWEPT: W is available? Yes, and not excluded. But note: in the first guess, we had E at the end and it was wrong, but now we have E at position 3? And we have S at 1, E at 3, P at 4, T at 5. So SWEPT would be S W E P T. That seems a valid word.

But let's check if W is available: yes, not excluded.

Other possibilities:

- SCEPT: not a word.
- SKEPT: not a word? Actually, ""skept"" is not a standard word; it's usually ""skeptic"" but that's 6 letters.
- STEPT: not a word? Step is 4 letters, and step-t? Not a word.
- SEWPT: not a word.
- SEPT: that's 4 letters, missing one.

So the only common word I can think of is ""SWEPT"".

But let's confirm: ""swept"" is the past tense of sweep, 5 letters.

Are there any other words?

- SHEPT: not a word.
- SLEPT: we already guessed and it had L which is excluded? In our third guess, we guessed ""slept"" and L was marked as absent (x). So L is not in the word, so ""slept"" is not the word. But we have S? E P T, and with L excluded, so it can't be slept.

Another word: ""CREPT"" but C is excluded and R is excluded? C and R are excluded from the first guess.

""ADEPT"" but A is excluded.

""INEPT"" but I is excluded.

So ""SWEPT"" seems the only common word.

But we have to make sure that W is not excluded? It isn't.

Also, in the first guess, we had E at the end and it was wrong, but in SWEPT, E is at position 3, which is correct.

In the second guess, we had ""times"" with T at 1 (wrong) and S at 5 (wrong), but in SWEPT, T is at 5? And we have T at 5 as correct? Yes, from the third guess.

So SWEPT should be the word.

But let's double-check the feedback:

First guess: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-) -> E was present but not at 5. In SWEPT, E is at 3, so that matches.

Second guess: times -> T(-) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(-) 
- T was present but not at 1 (in SWEPT, T is at 5, so not at 1 -> correct, and present)
- E was present but not at 4 (in SWEPT, E is at 3, not at 4 -> correct)
- S was present but not at 5 (in SWEPT, S is at 1, not at 5 -> correct)

Third guess: slept -> S(✓) L(x) E(✓) P(✓) T(✓) 
- S at 1: correct (SWEPT has S at 1)
- L: not in the word (SWEPT has no L)
- E at 3: correct (SWEPT has E at 3)
- P at 4: correct (SWEPT has P at 4)
- T at 5: correct (SWEPT has T at 5)

So everything matches.

Therefore, the secret word should be ""SWEPT"".

But we are to make a guess, and we have 6 tries. We can guess ""SWEPT"" as our fourth guess.

But note: we haven't guessed W before? And it's not excluded? So we don't know if it's in the word? But in this case, we deduced that it must be W to form the word.

Since we have four letters fixed and only one missing, and ""SWEPT"" is the only common word, we can guess that.

So the next guess is ""SWEPT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, I, M, L (marked ""x"" in guesses).
- **Confirmed letters and positions**:
  - Position 1: S (✓ from ""slept"")
  - Position 3: E (✓ from ""slept"" and known present from earlier)
  - Position 4: P (✓ from ""slept"")
  - Position 5: T (✓ from ""slept"" and known present from earlier)
- **Missing**: Only position 2 remains unknown.

The secret word pattern is: `S _ E P T`.

- Position 2 must be a letter not excluded and not already placed (so not S, E, P, T, or any excluded letter).
- Valid letters for position 2: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The only common English word fitting this pattern is **SWEPT** (past tense of ""sweep"").

**Why SWEPT?**
- It uses W (a valid, untested letter) in position 2.
- It satisfies all feedback:
  - No excluded letters (W is allowed).
  - Confirmed positions: S (1), E (3), P (4), T (5) match exactly.
  - E is not in position 4 or 5 (per ""times"" and ""crane"" feedback), and SWEPT places E correctly at position 3.
  - S is not in position 5 (per ""times""), and SWEPT places S correctly at position 1.
  - T is not in position 1 (per ""times""), and SWEPT places T correctly at position 5.

Given the pattern and constraints, **SWEPT** is the only feasible solution.

<guess>swept</guess>",swept,"We have feedback from the third guess ""slept"":
- S(✓) : S is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- L(x) : L is not in the word.
- E(✓) : E is correct and in the right position (position 3).
- P(✓) : P is correct and in the right position (position 4).
- T(✓) : T is correct and in the right position (position 5).

So the secret word has:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: P
- Position 5: T

And we know that L is not in the word.

Also, from previous guesses, we know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, I, M, and now L.

We are missing position 2. And we know the letter at position 2 must be one that hasn't been excluded and is not S, E, P, T (since those are already placed).

We also know from the first guess that E is in the word (which we now know is at position 3) and from the second guess that T and S are in the word (now at positions 1 and 5).

The missing letter (position 2) must be a letter that:
- Is not in the excluded list: C, R, A, N, I, M, L.
- And not S, E, P, T.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we have S _ E P T.

We need to find a letter for the second position that makes a valid English word.

Let's list possible letters that are not excluded and not used. Excluded: C, R, A, N, I, M, L. Used: S, E, P, T.

Now, what letters can fit in the second position to form a word? We need a word of the form S? E P T.

Common English words that fit this pattern:

- SWEPT: W is available? Yes, and not excluded. But note: in the first guess, we had E at the end and it was wrong, but now we have E at position 3? And we have S at 1, E at 3, P at 4, T at 5. So SWEPT would be S W E P T. That seems a valid word.

But let's check if W is available: yes, not excluded.

Are there any other words?

- SHEPT: not a word.
- SLEPT: we already guessed and it had L which is excluded? In our third guess, we guessed ""slept"" and L was marked as absent (x). So L is not in the word, so ""slept"" is not the word. But we have S? E P T, and with L excluded, so it can't be slept.

Another word: ""CREPT"" but C is excluded and R is excluded? C and R are excluded from the first guess.

""ADEPT"" but A is excluded.

""INEPT"" but I is excluded.

So ""SWEPT"" seems the only common word.

But we have to make sure that W is not excluded? It isn't.

Also, in the first guess, we had E at the end and it was wrong, but in SWEPT, E is at position 3, which is correct.

In the second guess, we had ""times"" with T at 1 (wrong) and S at 5 (wrong), but in SWEPT, T is at 5? And we have T at 5 as correct? Yes, from the third guess.

So SWEPT should be the word.

But let's double-check the feedback:

First guess: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-) -> E was present but not at 5. In SWEPT, E is at 3, so that matches.

Second guess: times -> T(-) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(-) 
- T was present but not at 1 (in SWEPT, T is at 5, so not at 1 -> correct, and present)
- E was present but not at 4 (in SWEPT, E is at 3, not at 4 -> correct)
- S was present but not at 5 (in SWEPT, S is at 1, not at 5 -> correct)

Third guess: slept -> S(✓) L(x) E(✓) P(✓) T(✓) 
- S at 1: correct (SWEPT has S at 1)
- L: not in the word (SWEPT has no L)
- E at 3: correct (SWEPT has E at 3)
- P at 4: correct (SWEPT has P at 4)
- T at 5: correct (SWEPT has T at 5)

So everything matches.
