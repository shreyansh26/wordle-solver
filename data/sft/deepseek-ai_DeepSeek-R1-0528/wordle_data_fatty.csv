We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N).

For the first guess, I need to select a 5-letter word that maximizes information gain. A strong opener should:  
- Use common letters to increase hit probability  
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more ground  
- Include both vowels and consonants  

""CRANE"" is an optimal choice because:  
1. Contains frequent letters: C, R, A, N, E (all top 20 in English)  
2. Covers three vowels (A, E) and two consonants  
3. No duplicate letters → tests 5 unique characters  
4. Balanced structure helps identify positional patterns  

This sets up efficient deduction in subsequent guesses regardless of feedback.

We are given the first guess: ""crane"" with feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
This means:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (so not the third letter).
- N is not in the secret word.
- E is not in the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.

For the second guess, we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes the letter A (because A was present, but in the wrong position). However, note that A cannot be in position 3 (since that's where we guessed it and got ""-"", meaning it's present but not there). In our guess ""crane"", the A was at position 3 (index 2? Let's note: if we index 1-based: position 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E). So A must be in the word but not at position 3.

2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E since they are marked as absent.

Additionally, we should choose a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Now, we have to form a new 5-letter word without C, R, N, E and with an A that is not in position 3.

Let me list some common letters that are not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have the constraint on A: it must be in the word and not in position 3.

Possible positions for A in our new guess: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know the correct position of A yet. It could be in one of the other positions.

We should also try to include letters that haven't been tested yet to get new information.

Let's think of words that include A and avoid the excluded letters.

Some words that come to mind:

- ""salt"": but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So not.

Possible words:
- ""spalt""? Not a word.
- ""blast"": has A, but in position 2? And it avoids C,R,N,E? Let's check: B, L, A, S, T -> no C,R,N,E. But we don't know about these letters yet.

We want to cover more vowels? We know E is out, but I and O are still possibilities.

Another idea: ""audio""? But that has A and I, O, U. However, U is not excluded. But wait, we have only 5 positions: A at position 1? Then U, D, I, O. But we must avoid C,R,N,E.

Problem: ""audio"" has U, D, I, O. That would be: A in position 1, then U in 2, D in 3, I in 4, O in 5? But we are not sure about these letters. Also, note our first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but in ""audio"", A is at position 1. Since we have a ""-"" for A in position 3, we expect that the A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5 in the actual word? Not necessarily: the ""-"" only means that A is in the word but not at position 3. It doesn't forbid A to be at position 1,2,4,5? Actually, it doesn't tell us about the other positions. So we must include A in our new guess? Actually, we don't have to, because we know A is in the word. So we must include A. Yes, because we have a ""-"" meaning it's present.

So in our new guess, we must include A. Otherwise, we cannot rule out positions? Actually, we need to find the correct position.

But also note: we have eliminated many vowels: E is out, A is in. So we might want to test other vowels: I, O, U.

For vowels, we know E is out, so the secret word must have one or more of A, I, O, U (with A already confirmed).

Now, let's think of words with A and without C,R,N,E.

Possible words:

- ""stalk"": S,T,A,L,K -> A is at position 3? But wait, we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that in position 3 it was wrong? No! Wait: we guessed A at position 3 and it was absent (but the ""-"" means the letter is in the word but not at that position). So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it would be wrong because the correct word does not have A at position 3. Therefore, to avoid redundant information, we should not put A at position 3 again. Actually, we could put it at position 3 and we'd get an ""x"" (since it's not correct) but we already know it's not at position 3. So it's better not to because we wouldn't get new information about the position? Actually, we would get an ""x"" for that position? But no: if we put A at position 3, we know it will be ""-"" only if A is in the word but not there? We already know that. But by putting it again at 3, we don't learn anything about position 3. Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A in the second guess? Yes.

So in the new guess, A should not be at position 3.

Thus, A must be at one of positions: 1,2,4,5.

Now, let's build a word:

Option 1: place A in position 1: words starting with A? Without C,R,N,E.

Examples: ""about"": A,B,O,U,T -> but we have B,O,U,T. Also, we haven't tested B,O,U,T. So that's fine? But ""u"" is not tested? We can use this.

But note: ""about"" has the letter O and U? Which are new.

Option 2: place A in position 2: like ""lapse""? But ""lapse"" has E? E is excluded. So no.

We must avoid E.

So ""lapse"" is invalid because of E.

Another: ""pasta""? P,A,S,T,A -> duplicate A? But the word ""pasta"" has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? The feedback didn't indicate that. But in ""pasta"", at position 2 and 5. Our feedback rule: for a word with duplicate letters, the feedback may be tricky? Actually, we have to consider the rules.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to keep it simpler? Or it might be acceptable.

But ""pasta"" has A at positions 2 and 5. We are interested in the A: we could learn about position 2? But we don't have to avoid duplicates necessarily.

We'll pick words without duplicates? But the secret word may have duplicates, so we can.

But for second guess, let's try a word with distinct letters? To maximize information.

So ""about"": A (position1), B, O, U, T -> distinct letters? Yes: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct? Yes.

Similarly, ""admit"": A (position1), D, M, I, T -> distinct letters? Yes.

Now, ""admit"" includes M and I? Also good.

But we are avoiding E? Yes.

Also, ""aisle"": but that has S,L,E? E is excluded -> so no.

We must avoid E.

So ""admit"" is good.

Another: ""aloft"": A (position1), L, O, F, T -> distinct.

Or ""atoll"": but duplicate L? And not a common word? Actually, Wordle uses more common words.

But let's stick with common words.

Another option: place A in position 4? Such as ""delta""? But ""delta"" has E? Excluded -> no.

""coral""? But we excluded C (and C is the first letter) -> no.

So position 1 is easier for building words.

Position 2: words like ""waist""? but has S,T and avoids C,R,N,E? But W,A,I,S,T -> distinct? Yes.

But A is at position 2.

Similarly, ""paint"": has T and avoids C,R,N,E? P,A,I,N,T -> wait, N is excluded? We have N in ""paint""? But we know N is absent. So we cannot use N. Must avoid N.

So we cannot use ""paint"" because of N.

So we have to remember: avoid C,R,N,E.

Therefore, for the second guess, we must choose from letters excluding C,R,N,E and including A.

So set of available letters: A, and then B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We also want to test new vowels: I, O, U.

And avoid putting A at position 3.

Now, let me think of a word that incorporates these.

Common second guesses could be:

- ""about"": A (pos1), B, O, U, T -> good? Yes: A, B, O, U, T -> all letters not previously tried? Only A is confirmed to be present. Others are fresh.

- ""admit"": A, D, M, I, T -> and I is a vowel.

- ""aloft"": A, L, O, F, T

Another one: ""aegis"" has E? excluded.

Among these, I think ""admit"" is a good choice because we test two vowels: I and also O? No, in ""admit"" we have I? But not O? Actually, ""admit"" has I? Yes, at position 4? But then we test I.

""about"" has O and U.

Since we haven't tested any vowels except A and E (which is absent), it would be good to test I and O? So ""admit"" tests I? But what about O? It doesn't.

Alternatively, ""audio"" would be good: A, U, D, I, O -> all vowels? We have A,U,I,O? And D? But we are limited to 5 letters: ""audio"" is valid? Yes: A,U,D,I,O.

Let me confirm: A at position 1, U at 2, D at 3? Then I at 4, O at 5.

But we cannot use position 3 for A? Well, in this case A is at position1, so not position3.

But D is at position3? We don't know about D. But note: we must avoid C,R,N,E? ""audio"" contains: A,U,D,I,O -> all these are not forbidden? Yes.

And it uses the vowels A, I, O, and U? Actually, A is already known to be in the word, and testing I and O? Also U? That's good.

But what about consonants? We are not testing consonants? Also, we have D, which is a consonant? But we need to see.

The word ""audio"" is typically accepted in word games? I believe so.

We'll get feedback on each letter: A, U, D, I, O.

A is known to be in the word? But at position1: if it's correct, we get ""✓"", if not, then it might be ""-"" or not? Actually, we know A is in the word? But we don't know its position? So by testing A at position1, we can check if it's at 1? Similarly for other vowels.

But there is a potential issue: what if A is actually at position2? Then we might not test position2? But we'll see.

Alternatively, to get more consonant information? It's up to us.

We can also choose a word like ""stain"": but S,T,A,I,N -> but N is excluded? No. So cannot.

""point"": no A? Also, we must include A? Actually, we must include A because we know it is in the secret word? Otherwise, we are not confirming any location? Actually, we don't have to? But without A, we don't gain information about the position of A? That's true. Also, we are not forced to include A? But then we are not using the known information.

Since we have only 5 guesses left? Actually, we started with 6, so after first guess, we have 5 remaining? But we must be efficient.

So it is beneficial to include A and try it in a new position.

Therefore, let me choose between:

1. ""about"": tests A (pos1), B (consonant), O (vowel), U (vowel), T (consonant). 
2. ""admit"": tests A (pos1), D (consonant), M (consonant), I (vowel), T (consonant). 
3. ""audio"": tests A,U,D,I,O -> all? And also covers vowels.

But ""audio"" uses four vowels? Which might be a bit extreme? And only one consonant? Maybe not ideal? Because the secret word might have a mix? But possible.

Actually, the word ""audio"" is commonly used as a guess because it has four vowels and one consonant? Or three vowels? A, U, I, O: that's four vowels? No: A, U, I, O — that's four vowels? Actually, A, U, I, O are vowels? And D is consonant.

But in Wordle, vowel-heavy words can help eliminate vowels.

But note: we already know E is absent? So testing I and O? And U? Is good? Because A is present? But we don't know about I, O, U.

So it might be efficient? Yes.

I think ""audio"" is a valid choice? And it avoids the excluded letters? Let's see: excluded: C,R,N,E. No: ""audio"" has none of these.

But note: there's no position conflict? We are putting A at position1? And not position3? That's okay.

But let me see if there's a word with A not at position1? To test other positions? For example, if A is at position4? So we can test.

But ""audio"" is fine.

Another word: ""sault""? Not really? How about ""sauna""? But has U,A? But duplicate A? And N? N is excluded -> invalid.

So perhaps ""audio"" is a good candidate.

Alternatively, ""about"" tests two consonants and two new vowels? Also good.

Now, comparing: ""audio"" tests I and O? But in one word: four vowels? That's a lot? But we get information about these.

Another candidate: ""atoll""? Has duplicate L? And not common? Avoid.

""avoid"": A, V, O, I, D -> distinct letters? Yes: A,V,O,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. So ""avoid"" is another option? And it has V? Which is less common? Might be risky.

But ""audio"" is more common? Definitely.

To be safe, I'll go with ""audio"".

Also, let's note: in ""audio"", A is at position1? So if A in the secret word is at position1, we get true? If not, we get ""-""? But we already know it's not at position3? So we are testing position1.

Moreover, we are testing U at position2? Which might be correct? Or not.

Similarly, D at position3? Which we have no information? Etc.

But ""audio"" has the advantage of being a word with four vowels? So if the feedback shows that some vowels are missing? We eliminate quickly.

Therefore, I will guess ""audio"".

So:

Guessed word: audio

But note: A is at position1? No: let me spell: 
Position1: A
Position2: U
Position3: D
Position4: I
Position5: O

Good.

So we'll output:

<guess>audio</guess>

But before that, we need to write the thought process? In the tags.

We'll do:

<thinking>
First guess was ""crane"" with feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x). This means:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word, but not at position 3.

For the second guess, we need a word that includes A (but not at position 3) and avoids C, R, N, E.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We want to test other common vowels (like I, O, U) since E is not present.

After considering words like ""about"", ""admit"", and ""audio"", we choose ""audio"" because:
- It uses vowels A, U, I, and O, which are new and not tested.
- It avoids the excluded letters C, R, N, E.
- Word ""audio"" is a common word and helps in getting vowel information efficiently.

Thus, our next guess is ""audio"".
</think>
The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" shows:
- A is present but not in position 3.
- C, R, N, E are absent and excluded from the word.

For the second guess:
- Must include A since it's in the word (but avoid position 3).
- Must exclude C, R, N, E.
- To gather new information, focus on common letters not yet tested, especially vowels (I, O, U) and consonants like B, D, K, L, M, S, T.
- Prioritize testing A in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5) along with other untested vowels to efficiently determine their presence/absence.

After evaluating options like ""about"" (tests A at position 1, B, O, U, T), ""admit"" (tests A at position 1, D, M, I, T), and ""audio"", the word ""audio"" is selected because:
- It tests A at position 1 (a new position) and three untested vowels (U, I, O).
- All letters (A, U, D, I, O) are distinct and avoid excluded letters (C, R, N, E).
- Covering multiple vowels in one guess efficiently provides feedback on vowel presence/position, narrowing down consonant possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>audio</guess>",audio,"We are given the first guess: ""crane"" with feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
This means:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (so not the third letter).
- N is not in the secret word.
- E is not in the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.

For the second guess, we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes the letter A (because A was present, but in the wrong position). However, note that A cannot be in position 3 (since that's where we guessed it and got ""-"", meaning it's present but not there). In our guess ""crane"", the A was at position 3 (index 2? Let's note: if we index 1-based: position 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E). So A must be in the word but not at position 3.

2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E since they are marked as absent.

Additionally, we should choose a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Now, we have to form a new 5-letter word without C, R, N, E and with an A that is not in position 3.

Let me list some common letters that are not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have the constraint on A: it must be in the word and not in position 3.

Possible positions for A in our new guess: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know the correct position of A yet. It could be in one of the other positions.

We should also try to include letters that haven't been tested yet to get new information.

Let's think of words that include A and avoid the excluded letters.

Some words that come to mind:

- ""salt"": but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So not.

Possible words:
- ""spalt""? Not a word.
- ""blast"": has A, but in position 2? And it avoids C,R,N,E? Let's check: B, L, A, S, T -> no C,R,N,E. But we don't know about these letters yet.

We want to cover more vowels? We know E is out, but I and O are still possibilities.

Another idea: ""audio""? But that has A and I, O, U. However, U is not excluded. But wait, we have only 5 positions: A at position 1? Then U, D, I, O. But we must avoid C,R,N,E.

Problem: ""audio"" has U, D, I, O. That would be: A in position 1, then U in 2, D in 3, I in 4, O in 5? But we are not sure about these letters. Also, note our first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but in ""audio"", A is at position 1. Since we have a ""-"" for A in position 3, we expect that the A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5 in the actual word? Not necessarily: the ""-"" only means that A is in the word but not at position 3. It doesn't forbid A to be at position 1,2,4,5? Actually, it doesn't tell us about the other positions. So we must include A in our new guess? Actually, we don't have to, because we know A is in the word. So we must include A. Yes, because we have a ""-"" meaning it's present.

So in our new guess, we must include A. Otherwise, we cannot rule out positions? Actually, we need to find the correct position.

But also note: we have eliminated many vowels: E is out, A is in. So we might want to test other vowels: I, O, U.

For vowels, we know E is out, so the secret word must have one or more of A, I, O, U (with A already confirmed).

Now, let's think of words with A and without C,R,N,E.

Possible words:

- ""stalk"": S,T,A,L,K -> A is at position 3? But wait, we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that in position 3 it was wrong? No! Wait: we guessed A at position 3 and it was absent (but the ""-"" means the letter is in the word but not at that position). So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it would be wrong because the correct word does not have A at position 3. Therefore, to avoid redundant information, we should not put A at position 3 again. Actually, we could put it at position 3 and we'd get an ""x"" (since it's not correct) but we already know it's not at position 3. So it's better not to because we wouldn't get new information about the position? Actually, we would get an ""x"" for that position? But no: if we put A at position 3, we know it will be ""-"" only if A is in the word but not there? We already know that. But by putting it again at 3, we don't learn anything about position 3. Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A in the second guess? Yes.

So in the new guess, A should not be at position 3.

Thus, A must be at one of positions: 1,2,4,5.

Now, let's build a word:

Option 1: place A in position 1: words starting with A? Without C,R,N,E.

Examples: ""about"": A,B,O,U,T -> but we have B,O,U,T. Also, we haven't tested B,O,U,T. So that's fine? But ""u"" is not tested? We can use this.

But note: ""about"" has the letter O and U? Which are new.

Option 2: place A in position 2: like ""lapse""? But ""lapse"" has E? E is excluded. So no.

We must avoid E.

So ""lapse"" is invalid because of E.

Another: ""pasta""? P,A,S,T,A -> duplicate A? But the word ""pasta"" has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? The feedback didn't indicate that. But in ""pasta"", at position 2 and 5. Our feedback rule: for a word with duplicate letters, the feedback may be tricky? Actually, we have to consider the rules.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to keep it simpler? Or it might be acceptable.

But ""pasta"" has A at positions 2 and 5. We are interested in the A: we could learn about position 2? But we don't have to avoid duplicates necessarily.

We'll pick words without duplicates? But the secret word may have duplicates, so we can.

But for second guess, let's try a word with distinct letters? To maximize information.

So ""about"": A (position1), B, O, U, T -> distinct letters? Yes: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct? Yes.

Similarly, ""admit"": A (position1), D, M, I, T -> distinct letters? Yes.

Now, ""admit"" includes M and I? Also good.

But we are avoiding E? Yes.

Also, ""aisle"": but that has S,L,E? E is excluded -> so no.

We must avoid E.

So ""admit"" is good.

Another: ""aloft"": A (position1), L, O, F, T -> distinct.

Or ""atoll"": but duplicate L? And not a common word? Actually, Wordle uses more common words.

But let's stick with common words.

Another option: place A in position 4? Such as ""delta""? But ""delta"" has E? Excluded -> no.

""coral""? But we excluded C (and C is the first letter) -> no.

So position 1 is easier for building words.

Position 2: words like ""waist""? but has S,T and avoids C,R,N,E? But W,A,I,S,T -> distinct? Yes.

But A is at position 2.

Similarly, ""paint"": has T and avoids C,R,N,E? P,A,I,N,T -> wait, N is excluded? We have N in ""paint""? But we know N is absent. So we cannot use N. Must avoid N.

So we cannot use ""paint"" because of N.

So we have to remember: avoid C,R,N,E.

Therefore, for the second guess, we must choose from letters excluding C,R,N,E and including A.

So set of available letters: A, and then B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We also want to test new vowels: I, O, U.

And avoid putting A at position 3.

Now, let me think of a word that incorporates these.

Common second guesses could be:

- ""about"": A (pos1), B, O, U, T -> good? Yes: A, B, O, U, T -> all letters not previously tried? Only A is confirmed to be present. Others are fresh.

- ""admit"": A, D, M, I, T -> and I is a vowel.

- ""aloft"": A, L, O, F, T

Another one: ""aegis"" has E? excluded.

Among these, I think ""admit"" is a good choice because we test two vowels: I and also O? No, in ""admit"" we have I? But not O? Actually, ""admit"" has I? Yes, at position 4? But then we test I.

""about"" has O and U.

Since we haven't tested any vowels except A and E (which is absent), it would be good to test I and O? So ""admit"" tests I? But what about O? It doesn't.

Alternatively, ""audio"" would be good: A, U, D, I, O -> all vowels? We have A,U,I,O? And D? But we are limited to 5 letters: ""audio"" is valid? Yes: A,U,D,I,O.

Let me confirm: A at position 1, U at 2, D at 3? Then I at 4, O at 5.

But we cannot use position 3 for A? Well, in this case A is at position1, so not position3.

But D is at position3? We don't know about D. But note: we must avoid C,R,N,E? ""audio"" contains: A,U,D,I,O -> all these are not forbidden? Yes.

And it uses the vowels A, I, O, and U? Actually, A is already known to be in the word, and testing I and O? Also U? That's good.

But what about consonants? We are not testing consonants? Also, we have D, which is a consonant? But we need to see.

The word ""audio"" is typically accepted in word games? I believe so.

We'll get feedback on each letter: A, U, D, I, O.

A is known to be in the word? But at position1: if it's correct, we get ""✓"", if not, then it might be ""-"" or not? Actually, we know A is in the word? But we don't know its position? So by testing A at position1, we can check if it's at 1? Similarly for other vowels.

But there is a potential issue: what if A is actually at position2? Then we might not test position2? But we'll see.

Alternatively, to get more consonant information? It's up to us.

We can also choose a word like ""stain"": but S,T,A,I,N -> but N is excluded? No. So cannot.

""point"": no A? Also, we must include A? Actually, we must include A because we know it is in the secret word? Otherwise, we are not confirming any location? Actually, we don't have to? But without A, we don't gain information about the position of A? That's true. Also, we are not forced to include A? But then we are not using the known information.

Since we have only 5 guesses left? Actually, we started with 6, so after first guess, we have 5 remaining? But we must be efficient.

So it is beneficial to include A and try it in a new position.

Therefore, let me choose between:

1. ""about"": tests A (pos1), B (consonant), O (vowel), U (vowel), T (consonant). 
2. ""admit"": tests A (pos1), D (consonant), M (consonant), I (vowel), T (consonant). 
3. ""audio"": tests A,U,D,I,O -> all? And also covers vowels.

But ""audio"" uses four vowels? Which might be a bit extreme? And only one consonant? Maybe not ideal? Because the secret word might have a mix? But possible.

Actually, the word ""audio"" is commonly used as a guess because it has four vowels and one consonant? Or three vowels? A, U, I, O: that's four vowels? No: A, U, I, O — that's four vowels? Actually, A, U, I, O are vowels? And D is consonant.

But in Wordle, vowel-heavy words can help eliminate vowels.

But note: we already know E is absent? So testing I and O? And U? Is good? Because A is present? But we don't know about I, O, U.

So it might be efficient? Yes.

I think ""audio"" is a valid choice? And it avoids the excluded letters? Let's see: excluded: C,R,N,E. No: ""audio"" has none of these.

But note: there's no position conflict? We are putting A at position1? And not position3? That's okay.

But let me see if there's a word with A not at position1? To test other positions? For example, if A is at position4? So we can test.

But ""audio"" is fine.

Another word: ""sault""? Not really? How about ""sauna""? But has U,A? But duplicate A? And N? N is excluded -> invalid.

So perhaps ""audio"" is a good candidate.

Alternatively, ""about"" tests two consonants and two new vowels? Also good.

Now, comparing: ""audio"" tests I and O? But in one word: four vowels? That's a lot? But we get information about these.

Another candidate: ""atoll""? Has duplicate L? And not common? Avoid.

""avoid"": A, V, O, I, D -> distinct letters? Yes: A,V,O,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. So ""avoid"" is another option? And it has V? Which is less common? Might be risky.

But ""audio"" is more common? Definitely.

To be safe, I'll go with ""audio"".

Also, let's note: in ""audio"", A is at position1? So if A in the secret word is at position1, we get true? If not, we get ""-""? But we already know it's not at position3? So we are testing position1.

Moreover, we are testing U at position2? Which might be correct? Or not.

Similarly, D at position3? Which we have no information? Etc.

But ""audio"" has the advantage of being a word with four vowels? So if the feedback shows that some vowels are missing? We eliminate quickly.

Therefore, I will guess ""audio"".

So:

Guessed word: audio

But note: A is at position1? No: let me spell: 
Position1: A
Position2: U
Position3: D
Position4: I
Position5: O

Good.

So we'll output:

<guess>audio</guess>

But before that, we need to write the thought process? In the tags.

We'll do:

<thinking>
First guess was ""crane"" with feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x). This means:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word, but not at position 3.

For the second guess, we need a word that includes A (but not at position 3) and avoids C, R, N, E.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We want to test other common vowels (like I, O, U) since E is not present.

After considering words like ""about"", ""admit"", and ""audio"", we choose ""audio"" because:
- It uses vowels A, U, I, and O, which are new and not tested.
- It avoids the excluded letters C, R, N, E.
- Word ""audio"" is a common word and helps in getting vowel information efficiently.

Thus, our next guess is ""audio"".The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" shows:
- A is present but not in position 3.
- C, R, N, E are absent and excluded from the word.

For the second guess:
- Must include A since it's in the word (but avoid position 3).
- Must exclude C, R, N, E.
- To gather new information, focus on common letters not yet tested, especially vowels (I, O, U) and consonants like B, D, K, L, M, S, T.
- Prioritize testing A in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5) along with other untested vowels to efficiently determine their presence/absence.

After evaluating options like ""about"" (tests A at position 1, B, O, U, T), ""admit"" (tests A at position 1, D, M, I, T), and ""audio"", the word ""audio"" is selected because:
- It tests A at position 1 (a new position) and three untested vowels (U, I, O).
- All letters (A, U, D, I, O) are distinct and avoid excluded letters (C, R, N, E).
- Covering multiple vowels in one guess efficiently provides feedback on vowel presence/position, narrowing down consonant possibilities for subsequent guesses.",Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,fatty,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N).For the first guess, I need to select a 5-letter word that maximizes information gain. A strong opener should:  
- Use common letters to increase hit probability  
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more ground  
- Include both vowels and consonants  

""CRANE"" is an optimal choice because:  
1. Contains frequent letters: C, R, A, N, E (all top 20 in English)  
2. Covers three vowels (A, E) and two consonants  
3. No duplicate letters → tests 5 unique characters  
4. Balanced structure helps identify positional patterns  

This sets up efficient deduction in subsequent guesses regardless of feedback.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the first guess: ""crane"" with feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
This means:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (so not the third letter).
- N is not in the secret word.
- E is not in the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.

For the second guess, we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes the letter A (because A was present, but in the wrong position). However, note that A cannot be in position 3 (since that's where we guessed it and got ""-"", meaning it's present but not there). In our guess ""crane"", the A was at position 3 (index 2? Let's note: if we index 1-based: position 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E). So A must be in the word but not at position 3.

2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E since they are marked as absent.

Additionally, we should choose a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Now, we have to form a new 5-letter word without C, R, N, E and with an A that is not in position 3.

Let me list some common letters that are not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have the constraint on A: it must be in the word and not in position 3.

Possible positions for A in our new guess: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know the correct position of A yet. It could be in one of the other positions.

We should also try to include letters that haven't been tested yet to get new information.

Let's think of words that include A and avoid the excluded letters.

Some words that come to mind:

- ""salt"": but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So not.

Possible words:
- ""spalt""? Not a word.
- ""blast"": has A, but in position 2? And it avoids C,R,N,E? Let's check: B, L, A, S, T -> no C,R,N,E. But we don't know about these letters yet.

We want to cover more vowels? We know E is out, but I and O are still possibilities.

Another idea: ""audio""? But that has A and I, O, U. However, U is not excluded. But wait, we have only 5 positions: A at position 1? Then U, D, I, O. But we must avoid C,R,N,E.

Problem: ""audio"" has U, D, I, O. That would be: A in position 1, then U in 2, D in 3, I in 4, O in 5? But we are not sure about these letters. Also, note our first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but in ""audio"", A is at position 1. Since we have a ""-"" for A in position 3, we expect that the A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5 in the actual word? Not necessarily: the ""-"" only means that A is in the word but not at position 3. It doesn't forbid A to be at position 1,2,4,5? Actually, it doesn't tell us about the other positions. So we must include A in our new guess? Actually, we don't have to, because we know A is in the word. So we must include A. Yes, because we have a ""-"" meaning it's present.

So in our new guess, we must include A. Otherwise, we cannot rule out positions? Actually, we need to find the correct position.

But also note: we have eliminated many vowels: E is out, A is in. So we might want to test other vowels: I, O, U.

For vowels, we know E is out, so the secret word must have one or more of A, I, O, U (with A already confirmed).

Now, let's think of words with A and without C,R,N,E.

Possible words:

- ""stalk"": S,T,A,L,K -> A is at position 3? But wait, we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that in position 3 it was wrong? No! Wait: we guessed A at position 3 and it was absent (but the ""-"" means the letter is in the word but not at that position). So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it would be wrong because the correct word does not have A at position 3. Therefore, to avoid redundant information, we should not put A at position 3 again. Actually, we could put it at position 3 and we'd get an ""x"" (since it's not correct) but we already know it's not at position 3. So it's better not to because we wouldn't get new information about the position? Actually, we would get an ""x"" for that position? But no: if we put A at position 3, we know it will be ""-"" only if A is in the word but not there? We already know that. But by putting it again at 3, we don't learn anything about position 3. Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A in the second guess? Yes.

So in the new guess, A should not be at position 3.

Thus, A must be at one of positions: 1,2,4,5.

Now, let's build a word:

Option 1: place A in position 1: words starting with A? Without C,R,N,E.

Examples: ""about"": A,B,O,U,T -> but we have B,O,U,T. Also, we haven't tested B,O,U,T. So that's fine? But ""u"" is not tested? We can use this.

But note: ""about"" has the letter O and U? Which are new.

Option 2: place A in position 2: like ""lapse""? But ""lapse"" has E? E is excluded. So no.

We must avoid E.

So ""lapse"" is invalid because of E.

Another: ""pasta""? P,A,S,T,A -> duplicate A? But the word ""pasta"" has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? The feedback didn't indicate that. But in ""pasta"", at position 2 and 5. Our feedback rule: for a word with duplicate letters, the feedback may be tricky? Actually, we have to consider the rules.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to keep it simpler? Or it might be acceptable.

But ""pasta"" has A at positions 2 and 5. We are interested in the A: we could learn about position 2? But we don't have to avoid duplicates necessarily.

We'll pick words without duplicates? But the secret word may have duplicates, so we can.

But for second guess, let's try a word with distinct letters? To maximize information.

So ""about"": A (position1), B, O, U, T -> distinct letters? Yes: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct? Yes.

Similarly, ""admit"": A (position1), D, M, I, T -> distinct letters? Yes.

Now, ""admit"" includes M and I? Also good.

But we are avoiding E? Yes.

Also, ""aisle"": but that has S,L,E? E is excluded -> so no.

We must avoid E.

So ""admit"" is good.

Another: ""aloft"": A (position1), L, O, F, T -> distinct.

Or ""atoll"": but duplicate L? And not a common word? Actually, Wordle uses more common words.

But let's stick with common words.

Another option: place A in position 4? Such as ""delta""? But ""delta"" has E? Excluded -> no.

""coral""? But we excluded C (and C is the first letter) -> no.

So position 1 is easier for building words.

Position 2: words like ""waist""? but has S,T and avoids C,R,N,E? But W,A,I,S,T -> distinct? Yes.

But A is at position 2.

Similarly, ""paint"": has T and avoids C,R,N,E? P,A,I,N,T -> wait, N is excluded? We have N in ""paint""? But we know N is absent. So we cannot use N. Must avoid N.

So we cannot use ""paint"" because of N.

So we have to remember: avoid C,R,N,E.

Therefore, for the second guess, we must choose from letters excluding C,R,N,E and including A.

So set of available letters: A, and then B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We also want to test new vowels: I, O, U.

And avoid putting A at position 3.

Now, let me think of a word that incorporates these.

Common second guesses could be:

- ""about"": A (pos1), B, O, U, T -> good? Yes: A, B, O, U, T -> all letters not previously tried? Only A is confirmed to be present. Others are fresh.

- ""admit"": A, D, M, I, T -> and I is a vowel.

- ""aloft"": A, L, O, F, T

Another one: ""aegis"" has E? excluded.

Among these, I think ""admit"" is a good choice because we test two vowels: I and also O? No, in ""admit"" we have I? But not O? Actually, ""admit"" has I? Yes, at position 4? But then we test I.

""about"" has O and U.

Since we haven't tested any vowels except A and E (which is absent), it would be good to test I and O? So ""admit"" tests I? But what about O? It doesn't.

Alternatively, ""audio"" would be good: A, U, D, I, O -> all vowels? We have A,U,I,O? And D? But we are limited to 5 letters: ""audio"" is valid? Yes: A,U,D,I,O.

Let me confirm: A at position 1, U at 2, D at 3? Then I at 4, O at 5.

But we cannot use position 3 for A? Well, in this case A is at position1, so not position3.

But D is at position3? We don't know about D. But note: we must avoid C,R,N,E? ""audio"" contains: A,U,D,I,O -> all these are not forbidden? Yes.

And it uses the vowels A, I, O, and U? Actually, A is already known to be in the word, and testing I and O? Also U? That's good.

But what about consonants? We are not testing consonants? Also, we have D, which is a consonant? But we need to see.

The word ""audio"" is typically accepted in word games? I believe so.

We'll get feedback on each letter: A, U, D, I, O.

A is known to be in the word? But at position1: if it's correct, we get ""✓"", if not, then it might be ""-"" or not? Actually, we know A is in the word? But we don't know its position? So by testing A at position1, we can check if it's at 1? Similarly for other vowels.

But there is a potential issue: what if A is actually at position2? Then we might not test position2? But we'll see.

Alternatively, to get more consonant information? It's up to us.

We can also choose a word like ""stain"": but S,T,A,I,N -> but N is excluded? No. So cannot.

""point"": no A? Also, we must include A? Actually, we must include A because we know it is in the secret word? Otherwise, we are not confirming any location? Actually, we don't have to? But without A, we don't gain information about the position of A? That's true. Also, we are not forced to include A? But then we are not using the known information.

Since we have only 5 guesses left? Actually, we started with 6, so after first guess, we have 5 remaining? But we must be efficient.

So it is beneficial to include A and try it in a new position.

Therefore, let me choose between:

1. ""about"": tests A (pos1), B (consonant), O (vowel), U (vowel), T (consonant). 
2. ""admit"": tests A (pos1), D (consonant), M (consonant), I (vowel), T (consonant). 
3. ""audio"": tests A,U,D,I,O -> all? And also covers vowels.

But ""audio"" uses four vowels? Which might be a bit extreme? And only one consonant? Maybe not ideal? Because the secret word might have a mix? But possible.

Actually, the word ""audio"" is commonly used as a guess because it has four vowels and one consonant? Or three vowels? A, U, I, O: that's four vowels? No: A, U, I, O — that's four vowels? Actually, A, U, I, O are vowels? And D is consonant.

But in Wordle, vowel-heavy words can help eliminate vowels.

But note: we already know E is absent? So testing I and O? And U? Is good? Because A is present? But we don't know about I, O, U.

So it might be efficient? Yes.

I think ""audio"" is a valid choice? And it avoids the excluded letters? Let's see: excluded: C,R,N,E. No: ""audio"" has none of these.

But note: there's no position conflict? We are putting A at position1? And not position3? That's okay.

But let me see if there's a word with A not at position1? To test other positions? For example, if A is at position4? So we can test.

But ""audio"" is fine.

Another word: ""sault""? Not really? How about ""sauna""? But has U,A? But duplicate A? And N? N is excluded -> invalid.

So perhaps ""audio"" is a good candidate.

Alternatively, ""about"" tests two consonants and two new vowels? Also good.

Now, comparing: ""audio"" tests I and O? But in one word: four vowels? That's a lot? But we get information about these.

Another candidate: ""atoll""? Has duplicate L? And not common? Avoid.

""avoid"": A, V, O, I, D -> distinct letters? Yes: A,V,O,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. So ""avoid"" is another option? And it has V? Which is less common? Might be risky.

But ""audio"" is more common? Definitely.

To be safe, I'll go with ""audio"".

Also, let's note: in ""audio"", A is at position1? So if A in the secret word is at position1, we get true? If not, we get ""-""? But we already know it's not at position3? So we are testing position1.

Moreover, we are testing U at position2? Which might be correct? Or not.

Similarly, D at position3? Which we have no information? Etc.

But ""audio"" has the advantage of being a word with four vowels? So if the feedback shows that some vowels are missing? We eliminate quickly.

Therefore, I will guess ""audio"".

So:

Guessed word: audio

But note: A is at position1? No: let me spell: 
Position1: A
Position2: U
Position3: D
Position4: I
Position5: O

Good.

So we'll output:

<guess>audio</guess>

But before that, we need to write the thought process? In the tags.

We'll do:

<thinking>
First guess was ""crane"" with feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x). This means:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word, but not at position 3.

For the second guess, we need a word that includes A (but not at position 3) and avoids C, R, N, E.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We want to test other common vowels (like I, O, U) since E is not present.

After considering words like ""about"", ""admit"", and ""audio"", we choose ""audio"" because:
- It uses vowels A, U, I, and O, which are new and not tested.
- It avoids the excluded letters C, R, N, E.
- Word ""audio"" is a common word and helps in getting vowel information efficiently.

Thus, our next guess is ""audio"".The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" shows:
- A is present but not in position 3.
- C, R, N, E are absent and excluded from the word.

For the second guess:
- Must include A since it's in the word (but avoid position 3).
- Must exclude C, R, N, E.
- To gather new information, focus on common letters not yet tested, especially vowels (I, O, U) and consonants like B, D, K, L, M, S, T.
- Prioritize testing A in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5) along with other untested vowels to efficiently determine their presence/absence.

After evaluating options like ""about"" (tests A at position 1, B, O, U, T), ""admit"" (tests A at position 1, D, M, I, T), and ""audio"", the word ""audio"" is selected because:
- It tests A at position 1 (a new position) and three untested vowels (U, I, O).
- All letters (A, U, D, I, O) are distinct and avoid excluded letters (C, R, N, E).
- Covering multiple vowels in one guess efficiently provides feedback on vowel presence/position, narrowing down consonant possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.\n\nFor the second guess, we need a 5-letter word that:\n1. Includes the letter A (because A was present, but in the wrong position). However, note that A cannot be in position 3 (since that\'s where we guessed it and got ""-"", meaning it\'s present but not there). In our guess ""crane"", the A was at position 3 (index 2? Let\'s note: if we index 1-based: position 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E). So A must be in the word but not at position 3.\n\n2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E since they are marked as absent.\n\nAdditionally, we should choose a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.\n\nNow, we have to form a new 5-letter word without C, R, N, E and with an A that is not in position 3.\n\nLet me list some common letters that are not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe have the constraint on A: it must be in the word and not in position 3.\n\nPossible positions for A in our new guess: 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know the correct position of A yet. It could be in one of the other positions.\n\nWe should also try to include letters that haven\'t been tested yet to get new information.\n\nLet\'s think of words that include A and avoid the excluded letters.\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n\n- ""salt"": but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So not.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""spalt""? Not a word.\n- ""blast"": has A, but in position 2? And it avoids C,R,N,E? Let\'s check: B, L, A, S, T -> no C,R,N,E. But we don\'t know about these letters yet.\n\nWe want to cover more vowels? We know E is out, but I and O are still possibilities.\n\nAnother idea: ""audio""? But that has A and I, O, U. However, U is not excluded. But wait, we have only 5 positions: A at position 1? Then U, D, I, O. But we must avoid C,R,N,E.\n\nProblem: ""audio"" has U, D, I, O. That would be: A in position 1, then U in 2, D in 3, I in 4, O in 5? But we are not sure about these letters. Also, note our first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but in ""audio"", A is at position 1. Since we have a ""-"" for A in position 3, we expect that the A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5 in the actual word? Not necessarily: the ""-"" only means that A is in the word but not at position 3. It doesn\'t forbid A to be at position 1,2,4,5? Actually, it doesn\'t tell us about the other positions. So we must include A in our new guess? Actually, we don\'t have to, because we know A is in the word. So we must include A. Yes, because we have a ""-"" meaning it\'s present.\n\nSo in our new guess, we must include A. Otherwise, we cannot rule out positions? Actually, we need to find the correct position.\n\nBut also note: we have eliminated many vowels: E is out, A is in. So we might want to test other vowels: I, O, U.\n\nFor vowels, we know E is out, so the secret word must have one or more of A, I, O, U (with A already confirmed).\n\nNow, let\'s think of words with A and without C,R,N,E.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""stalk"": S,T,A,L,K -> A is at position 3? But wait, we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that in position 3 it was wrong? No! Wait: we guessed A at position 3 and it was absent (but the ""-"" means the letter is in the word but not at that position). So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it would be wrong because the correct word does not have A at position 3. Therefore, to avoid redundant information, we should not put A at position 3 again. Actually, we could put it at position 3 and we\'d get an ""x"" (since it\'s not correct) but we already know it\'s not at position 3. So it\'s better not to because we wouldn\'t get new information about the position? Actually, we would get an ""x"" for that position? But no: if we put A at position 3, we know it will be ""-"" only if A is in the word but not there? We already know that. But by putting it again at 3, we don\'t learn anything about position 3. Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A in the second guess? Yes.\n\nSo in the new guess, A should not be at position 3.\n\nThus, A must be at one of positions: 1,2,4,5.\n\nNow, let\'s build a word:\n\nOption 1: place A in position 1: words starting with A? Without C,R,N,E.\n\nExamples: ""about"": A,B,O,U,T -> but we have B,O,U,T. Also, we haven\'t tested B,O,U,T. So that\'s fine? But ""u"" is not tested? We can use this.\n\nBut note: ""about"" has the letter O and U? Which are new.\n\nOption 2: place A in position 2: like ""lapse""? But ""lapse"" has E? E is excluded. So no.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nSo ""lapse"" is invalid because of E.\n\nAnother: ""pasta""? P,A,S,T,A -> duplicate A? But the word ""pasta"" has two A\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters? The feedback didn\'t indicate that. But in ""pasta"", at position 2 and 5. Our feedback rule: for a word with duplicate letters, the feedback may be tricky? Actually, we have to consider the rules.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now to keep it simpler? Or it might be acceptable.\n\nBut ""pasta"" has A at positions 2 and 5. We are interested in the A: we could learn about position 2? But we don\'t have to avoid duplicates necessarily.\n\nWe\'ll pick words without duplicates? But the secret word may have duplicates, so we can.\n\nBut for second guess, let\'s try a word with distinct letters? To maximize information.\n\nSo ""about"": A (position1), B, O, U, T -> distinct letters? Yes: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""admit"": A (position1), D, M, I, T -> distinct letters? Yes.\n\nNow, ""admit"" includes M and I? Also good.\n\nBut we are avoiding E? Yes.\n\nAlso, ""aisle"": but that has S,L,E? E is excluded -> so no.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nSo ""admit"" is good.\n\nAnother: ""aloft"": A (position1), L, O, F, T -> distinct.\n\nOr ""atoll"": but duplicate L? And not a common word? Actually, Wordle uses more common words.\n\nBut let\'s stick with common words.\n\nAnother option: place A in position 4? Such as ""delta""? But ""delta"" has E? Excluded -> no.\n\n""coral""? But we excluded C (and C is the first letter) -> no.\n\nSo position 1 is easier for building words.\n\nPosition 2: words like ""waist""? but has S,T and avoids C,R,N,E? But W,A,I,S,T -> distinct? Yes.\n\nBut A is at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""paint"": has T and avoids C,R,N,E? P,A,I,N,T -> wait, N is excluded? We have N in ""paint""? But we know N is absent. So we cannot use N. Must avoid N.\n\nSo we cannot use ""paint"" because of N.\n\nSo we have to remember: avoid C,R,N,E.\n\nTherefore, for the second guess, we must choose from letters excluding C,R,N,E and including A.\n\nSo set of available letters: A, and then B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe also want to test new vowels: I, O, U.\n\nAnd avoid putting A at position 3.\n\nNow, let me think of a word that incorporates these.\n\nCommon second guesses could be:\n\n- ""about"": A (pos1), B, O, U, T -> good? Yes: A, B, O, U, T -> all letters not previously tried? Only A is confirmed to be present. Others are fresh.\n\n- ""admit"": A, D, M, I, T -> and I is a vowel.\n\n- ""aloft"": A, L, O, F, T\n\nAnother one: ""aegis"" has E? excluded.\n\nAmong these, I think ""admit"" is a good choice because we test two vowels: I and also O? No, in ""admit"" we have I? But not O? Actually, ""admit"" has I? Yes, at position 4? But then we test I.\n\n""about"" has O and U.\n\nSince we haven\'t tested any vowels except A and E (which is absent), it would be good to test I and O? So ""admit"" tests I? But what about O? It doesn\'t.\n\nAlternatively, ""audio"" would be good: A, U, D, I, O -> all vowels? We have A,U,I,O? And D? But we are limited to 5 letters: ""audio"" is valid? Yes: A,U,D,I,O.\n\nLet me confirm: A at position 1, U at 2, D at 3? Then I at 4, O at 5.\n\nBut we cannot use position 3 for A? Well, in this case A is at position1, so not position3.\n\nBut D is at position3? We don\'t know about D. But note: we must avoid C,R,N,E? ""audio"" contains: A,U,D,I,O -> all these are not forbidden? Yes.\n\nAnd it uses the vowels A, I, O, and U? Actually, A is already known to be in the word, and testing I and O? Also U? That\'s good.\n\nBut what about consonants? We are not testing consonants? Also, we have D, which is a consonant? But we need to see.\n\nThe word ""audio"" is typically accepted in word games? I believe so.\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on each letter: A, U, D, I, O.\n\nA is known to be in the word? But at position1: if it\'s correct, we get ""✓"", if not, then it might be ""-"" or not? Actually, we know A is in the word? But we don\'t know its position? So by testing A at position1, we can check if it\'s at 1? Similarly for other vowels.\n\nBut there is a potential issue: what if A is actually at position2? Then we might not test position2? But we\'ll see.\n\nAlternatively, to get more consonant information? It\'s up to us.\n\nWe can also choose a word like ""stain"": but S,T,A,I,N -> but N is excluded? No. So cannot.\n\n""point"": no A? Also, we must include A? Actually, we must include A because we know it is in the secret word? Otherwise, we are not confirming any location? Actually, we don\'t have to? But without A, we don\'t gain information about the position of A? That\'s true. Also, we are not forced to include A? But then we are not using the known information.\n\nSince we have only 5 guesses left? Actually, we started with 6, so after first guess, we have 5 remaining? But we must be efficient.\n\nSo it is beneficial to include A and try it in a new position.\n\nTherefore, let me choose between:\n\n1. ""about"": tests A (pos1), B (consonant), O (vowel), U (vowel), T (consonant). \n2. ""admit"": tests A (pos1), D (consonant), M (consonant), I (vowel), T (consonant). \n3. ""audio"": tests A,U,D,I,O -> all? And also covers vowels.\n\nBut ""audio"" uses four vowels? Which might be a bit extreme? And only one consonant? Maybe not ideal? Because the secret word might have a mix? But possible.\n\nActually, the word ""audio"" is commonly used as a guess because it has four vowels and one consonant? Or three vowels? A, U, I, O: that\'s four vowels? No: A, U, I, O — that\'s four vowels? Actually, A, U, I, O are vowels? And D is consonant.\n\nBut in Wordle, vowel-heavy words can help eliminate vowels.\n\nBut note: we already know E is absent? So testing I and O? And U? Is good? Because A is present? But we don\'t know about I, O, U.\n\nSo it might be efficient? Yes.\n\nI think ""audio"" is a valid choice? And it avoids the excluded letters? Let\'s see: excluded: C,R,N,E. No: ""audio"" has none of these.\n\nBut note: there\'s no position conflict? We are putting A at position1? And not position3? That\'s okay.\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word with A not at position1? To test other positions? For example, if A is at position4? So we can test.\n\nBut ""audio"" is fine.\n\nAnother word: ""sault""? Not really? How about ""sauna""? But has U,A? But duplicate A? And N? N is excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo perhaps ""audio"" is a good candidate.\n\nAlternatively, ""about"" tests two consonants and two new vowels? Also good.\n\nNow, comparing: ""audio"" tests I and O? But in one word: four vowels? That\'s a lot? But we get information about these.\n\nAnother candidate: ""atoll""? Has duplicate L? And not common? Avoid.\n\n""avoid"": A, V, O, I, D -> distinct letters? Yes: A,V,O,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. So ""avoid"" is another option? And it has V? Which is less common? Might be risky.\n\nBut ""audio"" is more common? Definitely.\n\nTo be safe, I\'ll go with ""audio"".\n\nAlso, let\'s note: in ""audio"", A is at position1? So if A in the secret word is at position1, we get true? If not, we get ""-""? But we already know it\'s not at position3? So we are testing position1.\n\nMoreover, we are testing U at position2? Which might be correct? Or not.\n\nSimilarly, D at position3? Which we have no information? Etc.\n\nBut ""audio"" has the advantage of being a word with four vowels? So if the feedback shows that some vowels are missing? We eliminate quickly.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""audio"".\n\nSo:\n\nGuessed word: audio\n\nBut note: A is at position1? No: let me spell: \nPosition1: A\nPosition2: U\nPosition3: D\nPosition4: I\nPosition5: O\n\nGood.\n\nSo we\'ll output:\n\n<guess>audio</guess>\n\nBut before that, we need to write the thought process? In the tags.\n\nWe\'ll do:\n\n<thinking>\nFirst guess was ""crane"" with feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x).

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.
- A is present but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
Meaning:
- A is present but not in position 1 (since we guessed A at position 1 and got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not there).
- U, D, I, O are absent from the secret word.

Now, combining the information:

From guess 1: A is present and not at position 3.
From guess 2: A is present and not at position 1.

Therefore, A must be in the secret word at position 2, 4, or 5.

Also, the absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

So the secret word does not contain any of: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

Now, what letters are possible? We have the alphabet minus the absent ones.

Absent: C, D, E, I, N, O, R, U.

So available letters: A, B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: A is present, so it must be included, and we know it's at position 2, 4, or 5.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes A (at position 2, 4, or 5) and uses only the available letters.

Also, we want to maximize information by testing new letters and avoiding duplicates? But we don't know about duplicates? So we can use distinct letters? But the secret word might have duplicates? So we can use a word with distinct letters to test more.

Now, we have to consider the position of A: we know it's not at 1 or 3, so we should try it at a new position? For example, position 2? Or 4? Or 5.

We have three positions to test? We can choose one.

Also, we have many consonants left? We should test common ones? Like S, T, L, etc.

Let's list the available consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And we have A as the only vowel? Because E, I, O, U are out? So the secret word must have A and then consonants? Or possibly Y? Which can be a vowel? But in Wordle, Y is often considered a consonant? Or sometimes vowel? It depends? But we can use Y.

But note: the secret word must have at least one vowel? And we have A? So that's covered? But we don't know about Y? It could be used as a vowel? But we have to see.

But for now, we focus on the available letters.

We need to form a word that has A at position 2, 4, or 5? And the other positions from the available consonants.

But we don't know which position A is in? So we have to choose a word that places A in one of these positions? And then we get feedback? If we get A at position 2 correct? Then we know? Otherwise, if not, then it must be at 4 or 5? Etc.

So let's think of words that have A at position 2? For example.

Position 2: _ A _ _ _

With available letters? So first letter: from available? Then A at 2? Then third, fourth, fifth.

Similarly for position 4: _ _ _ A _

Or position 5: _ _ _ _ A

Now, we should choose a word that uses common letters? To increase the chance of hits.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible? Since we have 18 available letters? But we can only use 5? So we choose 5 that are common.

Common letters left: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's try to form words:

First, if we put A at position 2: then the word is ? A ? ? ?

Possible words: 
- ""salts""? But S is available? But ""salts"" has duplicate S? And 5 letters? S,A,L,T,S -> duplicate S? Not ideal? But we can? But let's avoid duplicates? For information? So better distinct.

""salty"": S,A,L,T,Y -> distinct? Yes. And Y is available? Yes.

But we have to check if Y is allowed? Yes.

Similarly, ""palsy"": P,A,L,S,Y -> distinct? Yes.

""balsa"": B,A,L,S,A -> duplicate A? But we don't know if A is duplicated? But in this case, we have A at position 2 and 5? But we are testing A at position 2? And if the secret word has only one A? Then we might get feedback? But it's okay? But we are trying to find the position? So having A at two positions might be confusing? But we can.

But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicate A? Because we don't know if the secret word has two A's? But we can try.

But for now, let's choose a word with A only once? And at position 2? For example.

""salty"": S,A,L,T,Y -> positions: S1, A2, L3, T4, Y5.

But we know A is not at position 3? But here A is at 2? So that's fine.

Similarly, ""tally"": T,A,L,L,Y -> duplicate L? Not distinct.

""fatal"": F,A,T,A,L -> duplicate A? Not good.

""gawky"": G,A,W,K,Y -> distinct? Yes.

But ""gawky"" is a word? Yes.

Now, if we put A at position 4: then word is ? ? ? A ?

For example: ""blast""? But B,L,A,S,T -> A at position 3? Not 4? We need A at 4.

""lasts"": L,A,S,T,S -> A at 2? Not 4.

""data"": not 5 letters.

""pasta"": P,A,S,T,A -> A at 2 and 5? Not at 4.

""cabal"": but C is excluded? No.

""focal"": F,O,C,A,L -> O and C excluded? No.

""vista"": V,I,S,T,A -> I is excluded? No, I is absent? So cannot.

""vista"" has I? Which is absent? So invalid.

""manta"": M,A,N,T,A -> N excluded? And duplicate A? No.

""panda"": P,A,N,D,A -> N and D excluded? No.

So it's hard to find a word with A at position 4? Because many words have A at the beginning or end? Or with vowels? But we don't have other vowels? Because I,O,U are out? So we need a word with A at 4? And consonants elsewhere.

For example: ""delta"" but E and D excluded? No.

""alpha"": A,L,P,H,A -> A at 1 and 5? Not 4.

""kappa"": K,A,P,P,A -> duplicate P and A? Not 4.

""llama"": L,L,A,M,A -> duplicates.

""sigma"": S,I,G,M,A -> I excluded? No.

""drama"": D,R,A,M,A -> D and R excluded? No.

So perhaps position 4 is difficult? Let's try position 5: _ _ _ _ A

Then words: ""pizza"": P,I,Z,Z,A -> I excluded? No.

""plaza"": P,L,A,Z,A -> A at 3 and 5? Not 5 only? We need A at 5? So last letter A.

""puma"": not 5 letters.

""tibia"": T,I,B,I,A -> I excluded? No.

""china"": C,H,I,N,A -> C, I, N excluded? No.

""arena"": A,R,E,N,A -> R, E, N excluded? And A at 1 and 5? Not 5 only.

""fella"": F,E,L,L,A -> E excluded? No.

""villa"": V,I,L,L,A -> I excluded? No.

""extra"": E,X,T,R,A -> E and R excluded? No.

""ultra"": U,L,T,R,A -> U and R excluded? No.

So it seems that with the constraints, words with A at position 4 or 5 are hard to find? Because they often include excluded vowels or consonants.

Therefore, position 2 might be easier? So let's go with A at position 2.

So words like: ? A ? ? ?

With available letters? And distinct? If possible.

""salty"": S,A,L,T,Y -> distinct? Yes. And S, L, T, Y are all available? Yes.

""balmy"": B,A,L,M,Y -> distinct? Yes.

""gawky"": G,A,W,K,Y -> distinct? Yes.

""happy"": H,A,P,P,Y -> duplicate P? Not distinct.

""jazzy"": J,A,Z,Z,Y -> duplicate Z? Not distinct.

""tabby"": T,A,B,B,Y -> duplicate B? Not distinct.

So ""salty"", ""balmy"", ""gawky"" are good.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters? S, T, L are more common than W, K, Y? So ""salty"" might be better? Because S, L, T are very common.

""salty"": S at position1, A at2, L at3, T at4, Y at5.

We know that position3 is not A? But we are putting L at3? Which is fine? We don't know about L.

Similarly, position1: S? We don't know.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? We are.

So I think ""salty"" is a good choice.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more common letters? Like M? Or P?

""palsy"": P,A,L,S,Y -> distinct? P,A,L,S,Y -> yes. And P, L, S, Y are available? Yes.

""palsy"" is a word? Yes, meaning a condition or a village? But in Wordle, it might be accepted? I think so.

But ""salty"" is more common? And has T? Which is very common.

""salty"" has T? Yes, at position4.

Similarly, ""tally"" has duplicate L? Not.

Another: ""fancy"" but C and N excluded? No.

So I think ""salty"" is fine.

But we have to consider: in ""salty"", we are putting A at position2? And we know A is not at1 or3? So position2 is a candidate? If we get A at2 correct? Then we know? Otherwise, if not, then A must be at4 or5? But we are not testing position4 or5? So we might need another guess? But that's okay.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A at position4? But we had difficulty? Let me try again.

What about ""blast""? But A at position3? Not allowed? Because we know A is not at3? So we cannot put A at3? Because it would be wrong? And we know it? So we must avoid position3 for A? So we cannot use a word with A at3? Because it will be ""-"" and we already know? So it's redundant? But we can? But it doesn't give new information? So better to avoid.

Therefore, only positions 2,4,5.

Now, for position4: let's find a word.

""swath"": S,W,A,T,H -> A at position3? Not 4? We need A at4.

""swath"" is S,W,A,T,H -> positions: S1, W2, A3, T4, H5? So A at3? Not 4.

""tract"": T,R,A,C,T -> R and C excluded? And A at3.

""cramp"": C,R,A,M,P -> excluded.

""draft"": D,R,A,F,T -> D and R excluded.

""graft"": G,R,A,F,T -> R excluded.

""kraft"": K,R,A,F,T -> R excluded.

""wafer"": W,A,F,E,R -> E and R excluded.

""waist"": W,A,I,S,T -> I excluded? And A at2.

""yeast"": Y,E,A,S,T -> E excluded.

""beast"": B,E,A,S,T -> E excluded.

""least"": L,E,A,S,T -> E excluded.

""feast"": F,E,A,S,T -> E excluded.

""blast"": B,L,A,S,T -> A at3? But we cannot put A at3? Because we know it's not there? So if we put A at3, we get ""-"" and we know? So it's not useful? But we can avoid.

But we need A at4? So let's find words ending with A? But that's position5? Or with A at4.

""llama"" not.

""comma"": C,O,M,M,A -> C and O excluded.

""gamma"": G,A,M,M,A -> A at2 and5? Not4.

""drama"": D,R,A,M,A -> excluded.

""mamma"": M,A,M,M,A -> duplicates.

""sigma"": S,I,G,M,A -> I excluded.

""dogma"": D,O,G,M,A -> D and O excluded.

""lemma"": L,E,M,M,A -> E excluded.

So it's very hard? Perhaps there are no common words with A at position4 and only consonants? Without the excluded vowels? Because the letters around might require vowels? But we don't have other vowels? So maybe position4 is rare? Or position5.

Position5: words ending with A? Like ""pizza"", but I excluded? ""plaza"": P,L,A,Z,A -> A at3 and5? Not5 only? We need the last letter to be A? So ""pizza"" has A at5? But I excluded? ""pizza"" is P,I,Z,Z,A -> so A at5? But I is excluded? So invalid.

""vodka"": V,O,D,K,A -> O and D excluded? No.

""sauna"": S,A,U,N,A -> U and N excluded? No.

""arena"": A,R,E,N,A -> excluded.

""china"": C,H,I,N,A -> excluded.

""kappa"": K,A,P,P,A -> A at2 and5? Not5 only.

""alpha"": A,L,P,H,A -> A at1 and5.

""beta"": not 5.

""theta"": T,H,E,T,A -> E excluded.

""quota"": Q,U,O,T,A -> U and O excluded.

""vista"": V,I,S,T,A -> I excluded.

""fella"": F,E,L,L,A -> E excluded.

""villa"": V,I,L,L,A -> I excluded.

""ultra"": U,L,T,R,A -> U and R excluded.

""extra"": E,X,T,R,A -> E and R excluded.

""opera"": O,P,E,R,A -> O, E, R excluded.

So no common words ending with A that fit the constraints? Because they often have vowels in the middle? Which are excluded.

Therefore, the only feasible position for A in the next guess is position 2? Or we have to use a word with A at position 2? And then we can test.

So we go with ""salty"".

But let's confirm: ""salty"" uses S, A, L, T, Y? All available? Yes.

And A at position 2? Which is a candidate position.

If we get A at position 2 correct? Then we know A is at 2? If not, then A must be at 4 or 5? But we haven't tested 4 or 5? So we'll know.

Also, we get feedback on S, L, T, Y? Which are new.

So I think that's a good guess.

Therefore, we guess ""salty"".

But note: we have to write the guess in the format.

So:

<thinking>
From the feedback:
- A is present but not at position 1 or 3, so it must be at 2, 4, or 5.
- The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, so available letters are A, B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word with A at position 2, 4, or 5. However, words with A at 4 or 5 are difficult to form with the available letters without using excluded vowels. Therefore, we choose a word with A at position 2 to test that position.

""salty"" is chosen because:
- It has A at position 2.
- It uses common letters: S, L, T, and Y (which is less common but acceptable).
- All letters are distinct and from the available set.

This guess will help us determine if A is at position 2 and provide information on S, L, T, Y.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
  - C, R, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - A is **present** but **not in position 3**.  

- **Guess 2: ""audio"" → Feedback: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)**  
  - A is **present** but **not in position 1** (since it was marked as ""-"" in position 1).  
  - U, D, I, O are **absent** from the secret word.  

### Key Deductions
1. **A must be in the secret word** at position 2, 4, or 5 (since it cannot be at 1 or 3).  
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. These cannot appear in the secret word.  
3. **Possible letters**: A, B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. The secret word **must include A** and likely consists of consonants from the remaining letters, as all other vowels (E, I, O, U) are excluded.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Focus on position 2 for A**: Since A cannot be at positions 1 or 3, testing position 2 is efficient. If A is correct at position 2, we lock in its location. If not, we narrow A to positions 4 or 5.  
- **Test new high-frequency consonants**: Prioritize common letters like S, T, L, M to maximize information gain.  
- **Avoid redundant positions**: Do not place A at position 1 or 3 (known incorrect) or reuse absent letters.  
- **Word selection**: Choose a valid 5-letter word with A at position 2, using distinct letters from the available set to cover more ground.  

### Chosen Guess: ""salty""
- **Why ""salty""?**  
  - A is at position 2 (testing a candidate position).  
  - Uses common consonants: S (position 1), L (position 3), T (position 4), and Y (position 5).  
  - All letters are distinct and from the available set (S, A, L, T, Y).  
  - Tests high-frequency letters: S, T, and L are among the most common consonants in English.  
  - If A is not at position 2, feedback will confirm A must be at 4 or 5, and we gain data on S, L, T, Y.  

<guess>salty</guess>",salty,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.
- A is present but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
Meaning:
- A is present but not in position 1 (since we guessed A at position 1 and got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not there).
- U, D, I, O are absent from the secret word.

Now, combining the information:

From guess 1: A is present and not at position 3.
From guess 2: A is present and not at position 1.

Therefore, A must be in the secret word at position 2, 4, or 5.

Also, the absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

So the secret word does not contain any of: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

Now, what letters are possible? We have the alphabet minus the absent ones.

Absent: C, D, E, I, N, O, R, U.

So available letters: A, B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: A is present, so it must be included, and we know it's at position 2, 4, or 5.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes A (at position 2, 4, or 5) and uses only the available letters.

Also, we want to maximize information by testing new letters and avoiding duplicates? But we don't know about duplicates? So we can use distinct letters? But the secret word might have duplicates? So we can use a word with distinct letters to test more.

Now, we have to consider the position of A: we know it's not at 1 or 3, so we should try it at a new position? For example, position 2? Or 4? Or 5.

We have three positions to test? We can choose one.

Also, we have many consonants left? We should test common ones? Like S, T, L, etc.

Let's list the available consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And we have A as the only vowel? Because E, I, O, U are out? So the secret word must have A and then consonants? Or possibly Y? Which can be a vowel? But in Wordle, Y is often considered a consonant? Or sometimes vowel? It depends? But we can use Y.

But note: the secret word must have at least one vowel? And we have A? So that's covered? But we don't know about Y? It could be used as a vowel? But we have to see.

But for now, we focus on the available letters.

We need to form a word that has A at position 2, 4, or 5? And the other positions from the available consonants.

But we don't know which position A is in? So we have to choose a word that places A in one of these positions? And then we get feedback? If we get A at position 2 correct? Then we know? Otherwise, if not, then it must be at 4 or 5? Etc.

So let's think of words that have A at position 2? For example.

Position 2: _ A _ _ _

With available letters? So first letter: from available? Then A at 2? Then third, fourth, fifth.

Similarly for position 4: _ _ _ A _

Or position 5: _ _ _ _ A

Now, we should choose a word that uses common letters? To increase the chance of hits.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible? Since we have 18 available letters? But we can only use 5? So we choose 5 that are common.

Common letters left: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's try to form words:

First, if we put A at position 2: then the word is ? A ? ? ?

Possible words: 
- ""salts""? But S is available? But ""salts"" has duplicate S? And 5 letters? S,A,L,T,S -> duplicate S? Not ideal? But we can? But let's avoid duplicates? For information? So better distinct.

""salty"": S,A,L,T,Y -> distinct? Yes. And Y is available? Yes.

But we have to check if Y is allowed? Yes.

Similarly, ""palsy"": P,A,L,S,Y -> distinct? Yes.

""balsa"": B,A,L,S,A -> duplicate A? But we don't know if A is duplicated? But in this case, we have A at position 2 and 5? But we are testing A at position 2? And if the secret word has only one A? Then we might get feedback? But it's okay? But we are trying to find the position? So having A at two positions might be confusing? But we can.

But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicate A? Because we don't know if the secret word has two A's? But we can try.

But for now, let's choose a word with A only once? And at position 2? For example.

""salty"": S,A,L,T,Y -> positions: S1, A2, L3, T4, Y5.

But we know A is not at position 3? But here A is at 2? So that's fine.

Similarly, ""tally"": T,A,L,L,Y -> duplicate L? Not distinct.

""fatal"": F,A,T,A,L -> duplicate A? Not good.

""gawky"": G,A,W,K,Y -> distinct? Yes.

But ""gawky"" is a word? Yes.

Now, if we put A at position 4: then word is ? ? ? A ?

For example: ""blast""? But B,L,A,S,T -> A at position 3? Not 4? We need A at 4.

""lasts"": L,A,S,T,S -> A at 2? Not 4.

""data"": not 5 letters.

""pasta"": P,A,S,T,A -> A at 2 and 5? Not at 4.

""cabal"": but C is excluded? No.

""focal"": F,O,C,A,L -> O and C excluded? No.

""vista"": V,I,S,T,A -> I is excluded? No, I is absent? So cannot.

""vista"" has I? Which is absent? So invalid.

""manta"": M,A,N,T,A -> N excluded? And duplicate A? No.

""panda"": P,A,N,D,A -> N and D excluded? No.

So it's hard to find a word with A at position 4? Because many words have A at the beginning or end? Or with vowels? But we don't have other vowels? Because I,O,U are out? So we need a word with A at 4? And consonants elsewhere.

For example: ""delta"" but E and D excluded? No.

""alpha"": A,L,P,H,A -> A at 1 and 5? Not 4.

""kappa"": K,A,P,P,A -> duplicate P and A? Not 4.

""llama"": L,L,A,M,A -> duplicates.

""sigma"": S,I,G,M,A -> I excluded? No.

""drama"": D,R,A,M,A -> D and R excluded? No.

So perhaps position 4 is difficult? Let's try position 5: _ _ _ _ A

Then words: ""pizza"": P,I,Z,Z,A -> I excluded? No.

""plaza"": P,L,A,Z,A -> A at 3 and 5? Not 5 only? We need A at 5? So last letter A.

""puma"": not 5 letters.

""tibia"": T,I,B,I,A -> I excluded? No.

""china"": C,H,I,N,A -> C, I, N excluded? No.

""arena"": A,R,E,N,A -> R, E, N excluded? And A at 1 and 5? Not 5 only.

""fella"": F,E,L,L,A -> E excluded? No.

""villa"": V,I,L,L,A -> I excluded? No.

""extra"": E,X,T,R,A -> E and R excluded? No.

""ultra"": U,L,T,R,A -> U and R excluded? No.

So it seems that with the constraints, words with A at position 4 or 5 are hard to find? Because they often include excluded vowels or consonants.

Therefore, position 2 might be easier? So let's go with A at position 2.

So words like: ? A ? ? ?

With available letters? And distinct? If possible.

""salty"": S,A,L,T,Y -> distinct? Yes. And S, L, T, Y are all available? Yes.

""balmy"": B,A,L,M,Y -> distinct? Yes.

""gawky"": G,A,W,K,Y -> distinct? Yes.

""happy"": H,A,P,P,Y -> duplicate P? Not distinct.

""jazzy"": J,A,Z,Z,Y -> duplicate Z? Not distinct.

""tabby"": T,A,B,B,Y -> duplicate B? Not distinct.

So ""salty"", ""balmy"", ""gawky"" are good.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters? S, T, L are more common than W, K, Y? So ""salty"" might be better? Because S, L, T are very common.

""salty"": S at position1, A at2, L at3, T at4, Y at5.

We know that position3 is not A? But we are putting L at3? Which is fine? We don't know about L.

Similarly, position1: S? We don't know.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? We are.

So I think ""salty"" is a good choice.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more common letters? Like M? Or P?

""palsy"": P,A,L,S,Y -> distinct? P,A,L,S,Y -> yes. And P, L, S, Y are available? Yes.

""palsy"" is a word? Yes, meaning a condition or a village? But in Wordle, it might be accepted? I think so.

But ""salty"" is more common? And has T? Which is very common.

""salty"" has T? Yes, at position4.

Similarly, ""tally"" has duplicate L? Not.

Another: ""fancy"" but C and N excluded? No.

So I think ""salty"" is fine.

But we have to consider: in ""salty"", we are putting A at position2? And we know A is not at1 or3? So position2 is a candidate? If we get A at2 correct? Then we know? Otherwise, if not, then A must be at4 or5? But we are not testing position4 or5? So we might need another guess? But that's okay.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A at position4? But we had difficulty? Let me try again.

What about ""blast""? But A at position3? Not allowed? Because we know A is not at3? So we cannot put A at3? Because it would be wrong? And we know it? So we must avoid position3 for A? So we cannot use a word with A at3? Because it will be ""-"" and we already know? So it's redundant? But we can? But it doesn't give new information? So better to avoid.

Therefore, only positions 2,4,5.

Now, for position4: let's find a word.

""swath"": S,W,A,T,H -> A at position3? Not 4? We need A at4.

""swath"" is S,W,A,T,H -> positions: S1, W2, A3, T4, H5? So A at3? Not 4.

""tract"": T,R,A,C,T -> R and C excluded? And A at3.

""cramp"": C,R,A,M,P -> excluded.

""draft"": D,R,A,F,T -> D and R excluded.

""graft"": G,R,A,F,T -> R excluded.

""kraft"": K,R,A,F,T -> R excluded.

""wafer"": W,A,F,E,R -> E and R excluded.

""waist"": W,A,I,S,T -> I excluded? And A at2.

""yeast"": Y,E,A,S,T -> E excluded.

""beast"": B,E,A,S,T -> E excluded.

""least"": L,E,A,S,T -> E excluded.

""feast"": F,E,A,S,T -> E excluded.

""blast"": B,L,A,S,T -> A at3? But we cannot put A at3? Because we know it's not there? So if we put A at3, we get ""-"" and we know? So it's not useful? But we can avoid.

But we need A at4? So let's find words ending with A? But that's position5? Or with A at4.

""llama"" not.

""comma"": C,O,M,M,A -> C and O excluded.

""gamma"": G,A,M,M,A -> A at2 and5? Not4.

""drama"": D,R,A,M,A -> excluded.

""mamma"": M,A,M,M,A -> duplicates.

""sigma"": S,I,G,M,A -> I excluded.

""dogma"": D,O,G,M,A -> D and O excluded.

""lemma"": L,E,M,M,A -> E excluded.

So it's very hard? Perhaps there are no common words with A at position4 and only consonants? Without the excluded vowels? Because the letters around might require vowels? But we don't have other vowels? So maybe position4 is rare? Or position5.

Position5: words ending with A? Like ""pizza"", but I excluded? ""plaza"": P,L,A,Z,A -> A at3 and5? Not5 only? We need the last letter to be A? So ""pizza"" has A at5? But I excluded? ""pizza"" is P,I,Z,Z,A -> so A at5? But I is excluded? So invalid.

""vodka"": V,O,D,K,A -> O and D excluded? No.

""sauna"": S,A,U,N,A -> U and N excluded? No.

""arena"": A,R,E,N,A -> excluded.

""china"": C,H,I,N,A -> excluded.

""kappa"": K,A,P,P,A -> A at2 and5? Not5 only.

""alpha"": A,L,P,H,A -> A at1 and5.

""beta"": not 5.

""theta"": T,H,E,T,A -> E excluded.

""quota"": Q,U,O,T,A -> U and O excluded.

""vista"": V,I,S,T,A -> I excluded.

""fella"": F,E,L,L,A -> E excluded.

""villa"": V,I,L,L,A -> I excluded.

""ultra"": U,L,T,R,A -> U and R excluded.

""extra"": E,X,T,R,A -> E and R excluded.

""opera"": O,P,E,R,A -> O, E, R excluded.

So no common words ending with A that fit the constraints? Because they often have vowels in the middle? Which are excluded.

Therefore, the only feasible position for A in the next guess is position 2? Or we have to use a word with A at position 2? And then we can test.

So we go with ""salty"".

But let's confirm: ""salty"" uses S, A, L, T, Y? All available? Yes.

And A at position 2? Which is a candidate position.

If we get A at position 2 correct? Then we know A is at 2? If not, then A must be at 4 or 5? But we haven't tested 4 or 5? So we'll know.

Also, we get feedback on S, L, T, Y? Which are new.

So I think that's a good guess.

Therefore, we guess ""salty"".

But note: we have to write the guess in the format.

So:

<thinking>
From the feedback:
- A is present but not at position 1 or 3, so it must be at 2, 4, or 5.
- The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, so available letters are A, B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word with A at position 2, 4, or 5. However, words with A at 4 or 5 are difficult to form with the available letters without using excluded vowels. Therefore, we choose a word with A at position 2 to test that position.

""salty"" is chosen because:
- It has A at position 2.
- It uses common letters: S, L, T, and Y (which is less common but acceptable).
- All letters are distinct and from the available set.

This guess will help us determine if A is at position 2 and provide information on S, L, T, Y.

4. The secret word **must include A** and likely consists of consonants from the remaining letters, as all other vowels (E, I, O, U) are excluded.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Focus on position 2 for A**: Since A cannot be at positions 1 or 3, testing position 2 is efficient. If A is correct at position 2, we lock in its location. If not, we narrow A to positions 4 or 5.  
- **Test new high-frequency consonants**: Prioritize common letters like S, T, L, M to maximize information gain.  
- **Avoid redundant positions**: Do not place A at position 1 or 3 (known incorrect) or reuse absent letters.  
- **Word selection**: Choose a valid 5-letter word with A at position 2, using distinct letters from the available set to cover more ground.  

### Chosen Guess: ""salty""
- **Why ""salty""?**  
  - A is at position 2 (testing a candidate position).  
  - Uses common consonants: S (position 1), L (position 3), T (position 4), and Y (position 5).  
  - All letters are distinct and from the available set (S, A, L, T, Y).  
  - Tests high-frequency letters: S, T, and L are among the most common consonants in English.  
  - If A is not at position 2, feedback will confirm A must be at 4 or 5, and we gain data on S, L, T, Y.",Guess 3: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N).For the first guess, I need to select a 5-letter word that maximizes information gain. A strong opener should:  
- Use common letters to increase hit probability  
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more ground  
- Include both vowels and consonants  

""CRANE"" is an optimal choice because:  
1. Contains frequent letters: C, R, A, N, E (all top 20 in English)  
2. Covers three vowels (A, E) and two consonants  
3. No duplicate letters → tests 5 unique characters  
4. Balanced structure helps identify positional patterns  

This sets up efficient deduction in subsequent guesses regardless of feedback.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the first guess: ""crane"" with feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
This means:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (so not the third letter).
- N is not in the secret word.
- E is not in the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.

For the second guess, we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes the letter A (because A was present, but in the wrong position). However, note that A cannot be in position 3 (since that's where we guessed it and got ""-"", meaning it's present but not there). In our guess ""crane"", the A was at position 3 (index 2? Let's note: if we index 1-based: position 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E). So A must be in the word but not at position 3.

2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E since they are marked as absent.

Additionally, we should choose a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Now, we have to form a new 5-letter word without C, R, N, E and with an A that is not in position 3.

Let me list some common letters that are not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have the constraint on A: it must be in the word and not in position 3.

Possible positions for A in our new guess: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know the correct position of A yet. It could be in one of the other positions.

We should also try to include letters that haven't been tested yet to get new information.

Let's think of words that include A and avoid the excluded letters.

Some words that come to mind:

- ""salt"": but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So not.

Possible words:
- ""spalt""? Not a word.
- ""blast"": has A, but in position 2? And it avoids C,R,N,E? Let's check: B, L, A, S, T -> no C,R,N,E. But we don't know about these letters yet.

We want to cover more vowels? We know E is out, but I and O are still possibilities.

Another idea: ""audio""? But that has A and I, O, U. However, U is not excluded. But wait, we have only 5 positions: A at position 1? Then U, D, I, O. But we must avoid C,R,N,E.

Problem: ""audio"" has U, D, I, O. That would be: A in position 1, then U in 2, D in 3, I in 4, O in 5? But we are not sure about these letters. Also, note our first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but in ""audio"", A is at position 1. Since we have a ""-"" for A in position 3, we expect that the A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5 in the actual word? Not necessarily: the ""-"" only means that A is in the word but not at position 3. It doesn't forbid A to be at position 1,2,4,5? Actually, it doesn't tell us about the other positions. So we must include A in our new guess? Actually, we don't have to, because we know A is in the word. So we must include A. Yes, because we have a ""-"" meaning it's present.

So in our new guess, we must include A. Otherwise, we cannot rule out positions? Actually, we need to find the correct position.

But also note: we have eliminated many vowels: E is out, A is in. So we might want to test other vowels: I, O, U.

For vowels, we know E is out, so the secret word must have one or more of A, I, O, U (with A already confirmed).

Now, let's think of words with A and without C,R,N,E.

Possible words:

- ""stalk"": S,T,A,L,K -> A is at position 3? But wait, we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that in position 3 it was wrong? No! Wait: we guessed A at position 3 and it was absent (but the ""-"" means the letter is in the word but not at that position). So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it would be wrong because the correct word does not have A at position 3. Therefore, to avoid redundant information, we should not put A at position 3 again. Actually, we could put it at position 3 and we'd get an ""x"" (since it's not correct) but we already know it's not at position 3. So it's better not to because we wouldn't get new information about the position? Actually, we would get an ""x"" for that position? But no: if we put A at position 3, we know it will be ""-"" only if A is in the word but not there? We already know that. But by putting it again at 3, we don't learn anything about position 3. Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A in the second guess? Yes.

So in the new guess, A should not be at position 3.

Thus, A must be at one of positions: 1,2,4,5.

Now, let's build a word:

Option 1: place A in position 1: words starting with A? Without C,R,N,E.

Examples: ""about"": A,B,O,U,T -> but we have B,O,U,T. Also, we haven't tested B,O,U,T. So that's fine? But ""u"" is not tested? We can use this.

But note: ""about"" has the letter O and U? Which are new.

Option 2: place A in position 2: like ""lapse""? But ""lapse"" has E? E is excluded. So no.

We must avoid E.

So ""lapse"" is invalid because of E.

Another: ""pasta""? P,A,S,T,A -> duplicate A? But the word ""pasta"" has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? The feedback didn't indicate that. But in ""pasta"", at position 2 and 5. Our feedback rule: for a word with duplicate letters, the feedback may be tricky? Actually, we have to consider the rules.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to keep it simpler? Or it might be acceptable.

But ""pasta"" has A at positions 2 and 5. We are interested in the A: we could learn about position 2? But we don't have to avoid duplicates necessarily.

We'll pick words without duplicates? But the secret word may have duplicates, so we can.

But for second guess, let's try a word with distinct letters? To maximize information.

So ""about"": A (position1), B, O, U, T -> distinct letters? Yes: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct? Yes.

Similarly, ""admit"": A (position1), D, M, I, T -> distinct letters? Yes.

Now, ""admit"" includes M and I? Also good.

But we are avoiding E? Yes.

Also, ""aisle"": but that has S,L,E? E is excluded -> so no.

We must avoid E.

So ""admit"" is good.

Another: ""aloft"": A (position1), L, O, F, T -> distinct.

Or ""atoll"": but duplicate L? And not a common word? Actually, Wordle uses more common words.

But let's stick with common words.

Another option: place A in position 4? Such as ""delta""? But ""delta"" has E? Excluded -> no.

""coral""? But we excluded C (and C is the first letter) -> no.

So position 1 is easier for building words.

Position 2: words like ""waist""? but has S,T and avoids C,R,N,E? But W,A,I,S,T -> distinct? Yes.

But A is at position 2.

Similarly, ""paint"": has T and avoids C,R,N,E? P,A,I,N,T -> wait, N is excluded? We have N in ""paint""? But we know N is absent. So we cannot use N. Must avoid N.

So we cannot use ""paint"" because of N.

So we have to remember: avoid C,R,N,E.

Therefore, for the second guess, we must choose from letters excluding C,R,N,E and including A.

So set of available letters: A, and then B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We also want to test new vowels: I, O, U.

And avoid putting A at position 3.

Now, let me think of a word that incorporates these.

Common second guesses could be:

- ""about"": A (pos1), B, O, U, T -> good? Yes: A, B, O, U, T -> all letters not previously tried? Only A is confirmed to be present. Others are fresh.

- ""admit"": A, D, M, I, T -> and I is a vowel.

- ""aloft"": A, L, O, F, T

Another one: ""aegis"" has E? excluded.

Among these, I think ""admit"" is a good choice because we test two vowels: I and also O? No, in ""admit"" we have I? But not O? Actually, ""admit"" has I? Yes, at position 4? But then we test I.

""about"" has O and U.

Since we haven't tested any vowels except A and E (which is absent), it would be good to test I and O? So ""admit"" tests I? But what about O? It doesn't.

Alternatively, ""audio"" would be good: A, U, D, I, O -> all vowels? We have A,U,I,O? And D? But we are limited to 5 letters: ""audio"" is valid? Yes: A,U,D,I,O.

Let me confirm: A at position 1, U at 2, D at 3? Then I at 4, O at 5.

But we cannot use position 3 for A? Well, in this case A is at position1, so not position3.

But D is at position3? We don't know about D. But note: we must avoid C,R,N,E? ""audio"" contains: A,U,D,I,O -> all these are not forbidden? Yes.

And it uses the vowels A, I, O, and U? Actually, A is already known to be in the word, and testing I and O? Also U? That's good.

But what about consonants? We are not testing consonants? Also, we have D, which is a consonant? But we need to see.

The word ""audio"" is typically accepted in word games? I believe so.

We'll get feedback on each letter: A, U, D, I, O.

A is known to be in the word? But at position1: if it's correct, we get ""✓"", if not, then it might be ""-"" or not? Actually, we know A is in the word? But we don't know its position? So by testing A at position1, we can check if it's at 1? Similarly for other vowels.

But there is a potential issue: what if A is actually at position2? Then we might not test position2? But we'll see.

Alternatively, to get more consonant information? It's up to us.

We can also choose a word like ""stain"": but S,T,A,I,N -> but N is excluded? No. So cannot.

""point"": no A? Also, we must include A? Actually, we must include A because we know it is in the secret word? Otherwise, we are not confirming any location? Actually, we don't have to? But without A, we don't gain information about the position of A? That's true. Also, we are not forced to include A? But then we are not using the known information.

Since we have only 5 guesses left? Actually, we started with 6, so after first guess, we have 5 remaining? But we must be efficient.

So it is beneficial to include A and try it in a new position.

Therefore, let me choose between:

1. ""about"": tests A (pos1), B (consonant), O (vowel), U (vowel), T (consonant). 
2. ""admit"": tests A (pos1), D (consonant), M (consonant), I (vowel), T (consonant). 
3. ""audio"": tests A,U,D,I,O -> all? And also covers vowels.

But ""audio"" uses four vowels? Which might be a bit extreme? And only one consonant? Maybe not ideal? Because the secret word might have a mix? But possible.

Actually, the word ""audio"" is commonly used as a guess because it has four vowels and one consonant? Or three vowels? A, U, I, O: that's four vowels? No: A, U, I, O — that's four vowels? Actually, A, U, I, O are vowels? And D is consonant.

But in Wordle, vowel-heavy words can help eliminate vowels.

But note: we already know E is absent? So testing I and O? And U? Is good? Because A is present? But we don't know about I, O, U.

So it might be efficient? Yes.

I think ""audio"" is a valid choice? And it avoids the excluded letters? Let's see: excluded: C,R,N,E. No: ""audio"" has none of these.

But note: there's no position conflict? We are putting A at position1? And not position3? That's okay.

But let me see if there's a word with A not at position1? To test other positions? For example, if A is at position4? So we can test.

But ""audio"" is fine.

Another word: ""sault""? Not really? How about ""sauna""? But has U,A? But duplicate A? And N? N is excluded -> invalid.

So perhaps ""audio"" is a good candidate.

Alternatively, ""about"" tests two consonants and two new vowels? Also good.

Now, comparing: ""audio"" tests I and O? But in one word: four vowels? That's a lot? But we get information about these.

Another candidate: ""atoll""? Has duplicate L? And not common? Avoid.

""avoid"": A, V, O, I, D -> distinct letters? Yes: A,V,O,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. So ""avoid"" is another option? And it has V? Which is less common? Might be risky.

But ""audio"" is more common? Definitely.

To be safe, I'll go with ""audio"".

Also, let's note: in ""audio"", A is at position1? So if A in the secret word is at position1, we get true? If not, we get ""-""? But we already know it's not at position3? So we are testing position1.

Moreover, we are testing U at position2? Which might be correct? Or not.

Similarly, D at position3? Which we have no information? Etc.

But ""audio"" has the advantage of being a word with four vowels? So if the feedback shows that some vowels are missing? We eliminate quickly.

Therefore, I will guess ""audio"".

So:

Guessed word: audio

But note: A is at position1? No: let me spell: 
Position1: A
Position2: U
Position3: D
Position4: I
Position5: O

Good.

So we'll output:

<guess>audio</guess>

But before that, we need to write the thought process? In the tags.

We'll do:

<thinking>
First guess was ""crane"" with feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x). This means:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word, but not at position 3.

For the second guess, we need a word that includes A (but not at position 3) and avoids C, R, N, E.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We want to test other common vowels (like I, O, U) since E is not present.

After considering words like ""about"", ""admit"", and ""audio"", we choose ""audio"" because:
- It uses vowels A, U, I, and O, which are new and not tested.
- It avoids the excluded letters C, R, N, E.
- Word ""audio"" is a common word and helps in getting vowel information efficiently.

Thus, our next guess is ""audio"".The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" shows:
- A is present but not in position 3.
- C, R, N, E are absent and excluded from the word.

For the second guess:
- Must include A since it's in the word (but avoid position 3).
- Must exclude C, R, N, E.
- To gather new information, focus on common letters not yet tested, especially vowels (I, O, U) and consonants like B, D, K, L, M, S, T.
- Prioritize testing A in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5) along with other untested vowels to efficiently determine their presence/absence.

After evaluating options like ""about"" (tests A at position 1, B, O, U, T), ""admit"" (tests A at position 1, D, M, I, T), and ""audio"", the word ""audio"" is selected because:
- It tests A at position 1 (a new position) and three untested vowels (U, I, O).
- All letters (A, U, D, I, O) are distinct and avoid excluded letters (C, R, N, E).
- Covering multiple vowels in one guess efficiently provides feedback on vowel presence/position, narrowing down consonant possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>audio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.
- A is present but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
Meaning:
- A is present but not in position 1 (since we guessed A at position 1 and got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not there).
- U, D, I, O are absent from the secret word.

Now, combining the information:

From guess 1: A is present and not at position 3.
From guess 2: A is present and not at position 1.

Therefore, A must be in the secret word at position 2, 4, or 5.

Also, the absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

So the secret word does not contain any of: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

Now, what letters are possible? We have the alphabet minus the absent ones.

Absent: C, D, E, I, N, O, R, U.

So available letters: A, B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: A is present, so it must be included, and we know it's at position 2, 4, or 5.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes A (at position 2, 4, or 5) and uses only the available letters.

Also, we want to maximize information by testing new letters and avoiding duplicates? But we don't know about duplicates? So we can use distinct letters? But the secret word might have duplicates? So we can use a word with distinct letters to test more.

Now, we have to consider the position of A: we know it's not at 1 or 3, so we should try it at a new position? For example, position 2? Or 4? Or 5.

We have three positions to test? We can choose one.

Also, we have many consonants left? We should test common ones? Like S, T, L, etc.

Let's list the available consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And we have A as the only vowel? Because E, I, O, U are out? So the secret word must have A and then consonants? Or possibly Y? Which can be a vowel? But in Wordle, Y is often considered a consonant? Or sometimes vowel? It depends? But we can use Y.

But note: the secret word must have at least one vowel? And we have A? So that's covered? But we don't know about Y? It could be used as a vowel? But we have to see.

But for now, we focus on the available letters.

We need to form a word that has A at position 2, 4, or 5? And the other positions from the available consonants.

But we don't know which position A is in? So we have to choose a word that places A in one of these positions? And then we get feedback? If we get A at position 2 correct? Then we know? Otherwise, if not, then it must be at 4 or 5? Etc.

So let's think of words that have A at position 2? For example.

Position 2: _ A _ _ _

With available letters? So first letter: from available? Then A at 2? Then third, fourth, fifth.

Similarly for position 4: _ _ _ A _

Or position 5: _ _ _ _ A

Now, we should choose a word that uses common letters? To increase the chance of hits.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible? Since we have 18 available letters? But we can only use 5? So we choose 5 that are common.

Common letters left: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's try to form words:

First, if we put A at position 2: then the word is ? A ? ? ?

Possible words: 
- ""salts""? But S is available? But ""salts"" has duplicate S? And 5 letters? S,A,L,T,S -> duplicate S? Not ideal? But we can? But let's avoid duplicates? For information? So better distinct.

""salty"": S,A,L,T,Y -> distinct? Yes. And Y is available? Yes.

But we have to check if Y is allowed? Yes.

Similarly, ""palsy"": P,A,L,S,Y -> distinct? Yes.

""balsa"": B,A,L,S,A -> duplicate A? But we don't know if A is duplicated? But in this case, we have A at position 2 and 5? But we are testing A at position 2? And if the secret word has only one A? Then we might get feedback? But it's okay? But we are trying to find the position? So having A at two positions might be confusing? But we can.

But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicate A? Because we don't know if the secret word has two A's? But we can try.

But for now, let's choose a word with A only once? And at position 2? For example.

""salty"": S,A,L,T,Y -> positions: S1, A2, L3, T4, Y5.

But we know A is not at position 3? But here A is at 2? So that's fine.

Similarly, ""tally"": T,A,L,L,Y -> duplicate L? Not distinct.

""fatal"": F,A,T,A,L -> duplicate A? Not good.

""gawky"": G,A,W,K,Y -> distinct? Yes.

But ""gawky"" is a word? Yes.

Now, if we put A at position 4: then word is ? ? ? A ?

For example: ""blast""? But B,L,A,S,T -> A at position 3? Not 4? We need A at 4.

""lasts"": L,A,S,T,S -> A at 2? Not 4.

""data"": not 5 letters.

""pasta"": P,A,S,T,A -> A at 2 and 5? Not at 4.

""cabal"": but C is excluded? No.

""focal"": F,O,C,A,L -> O and C excluded? No.

""vista"": V,I,S,T,A -> I is excluded? No, I is absent? So cannot.

""vista"" has I? Which is absent? So invalid.

""manta"": M,A,N,T,A -> N excluded? And duplicate A? No.

""panda"": P,A,N,D,A -> N and D excluded? No.

So it's hard to find a word with A at position 4? Because many words have A at the beginning or end? Or with vowels? But we don't have other vowels? Because I,O,U are out? So we need a word with A at 4? And consonants elsewhere.

For example: ""delta"" but E and D excluded? No.

""alpha"": A,L,P,H,A -> A at 1 and 5? Not 4.

""kappa"": K,A,P,P,A -> duplicate P and A? Not 4.

""llama"": L,L,A,M,A -> duplicates.

""sigma"": S,I,G,M,A -> I excluded? No.

""drama"": D,R,A,M,A -> D and R excluded? No.

So perhaps position 4 is difficult? Let's try position 5: _ _ _ _ A

Then words: ""pizza"": P,I,Z,Z,A -> I excluded? No.

""plaza"": P,L,A,Z,A -> A at 3 and 5? Not 5 only? We need A at 5? So last letter A.

""puma"": not 5 letters.

""tibia"": T,I,B,I,A -> I excluded? No.

""china"": C,H,I,N,A -> C, I, N excluded? No.

""arena"": A,R,E,N,A -> R, E, N excluded? And A at 1 and 5? Not 5 only.

""fella"": F,E,L,L,A -> E excluded? No.

""villa"": V,I,L,L,A -> I excluded? No.

""extra"": E,X,T,R,A -> E and R excluded? No.

""ultra"": U,L,T,R,A -> U and R excluded? No.

So it seems that with the constraints, words with A at position 4 or 5 are hard to find? Because they often include excluded vowels or consonants.

Therefore, position 2 might be easier? So let's go with A at position 2.

So words like: ? A ? ? ?

With available letters? And distinct? If possible.

""salty"": S,A,L,T,Y -> distinct? Yes. And S, L, T, Y are all available? Yes.

""balmy"": B,A,L,M,Y -> distinct? Yes.

""gawky"": G,A,W,K,Y -> distinct? Yes.

""happy"": H,A,P,P,Y -> duplicate P? Not distinct.

""jazzy"": J,A,Z,Z,Y -> duplicate Z? Not distinct.

""tabby"": T,A,B,B,Y -> duplicate B? Not distinct.

So ""salty"", ""balmy"", ""gawky"" are good.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters? S, T, L are more common than W, K, Y? So ""salty"" might be better? Because S, L, T are very common.

""salty"": S at position1, A at2, L at3, T at4, Y at5.

We know that position3 is not A? But we are putting L at3? Which is fine? We don't know about L.

Similarly, position1: S? We don't know.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? We are.

So I think ""salty"" is a good choice.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more common letters? Like M? Or P?

""palsy"": P,A,L,S,Y -> distinct? P,A,L,S,Y -> yes. And P, L, S, Y are available? Yes.

""palsy"" is a word? Yes, meaning a condition or a village? But in Wordle, it might be accepted? I think so.

But ""salty"" is more common? And has T? Which is very common.

""salty"" has T? Yes, at position4.

Similarly, ""tally"" has duplicate L? Not.

Another: ""fancy"" but C and N excluded? No.

So I think ""salty"" is fine.

But we have to consider: in ""salty"", we are putting A at position2? And we know A is not at1 or3? So position2 is a candidate? If we get A at2 correct? Then we know? Otherwise, if not, then A must be at4 or5? But we are not testing position4 or5? So we might need another guess? But that's okay.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A at position4? But we had difficulty? Let me try again.

What about ""blast""? But A at position3? Not allowed? Because we know A is not at3? So we cannot put A at3? Because it would be wrong? And we know it? So we must avoid position3 for A? So we cannot use a word with A at3? Because it will be ""-"" and we already know? So it's redundant? But we can? But it doesn't give new information? So better to avoid.

Therefore, only positions 2,4,5.

Now, for position4: let's find a word.

""swath"": S,W,A,T,H -> A at position3? Not 4? We need A at4.

""swath"" is S,W,A,T,H -> positions: S1, W2, A3, T4, H5? So A at3? Not 4.

""tract"": T,R,A,C,T -> R and C excluded? And A at3.

""cramp"": C,R,A,M,P -> excluded.

""draft"": D,R,A,F,T -> D and R excluded.

""graft"": G,R,A,F,T -> R excluded.

""kraft"": K,R,A,F,T -> R excluded.

""wafer"": W,A,F,E,R -> E and R excluded.

""waist"": W,A,I,S,T -> I excluded? And A at2.

""yeast"": Y,E,A,S,T -> E excluded.

""beast"": B,E,A,S,T -> E excluded.

""least"": L,E,A,S,T -> E excluded.

""feast"": F,E,A,S,T -> E excluded.

""blast"": B,L,A,S,T -> A at3? But we cannot put A at3? Because we know it's not there? So if we put A at3, we get ""-"" and we know? So it's not useful? But we can avoid.

But we need A at4? So let's find words ending with A? But that's position5? Or with A at4.

""llama"" not.

""comma"": C,O,M,M,A -> C and O excluded.

""gamma"": G,A,M,M,A -> A at2 and5? Not4.

""drama"": D,R,A,M,A -> excluded.

""mamma"": M,A,M,M,A -> duplicates.

""sigma"": S,I,G,M,A -> I excluded.

""dogma"": D,O,G,M,A -> D and O excluded.

""lemma"": L,E,M,M,A -> E excluded.

So it's very hard? Perhaps there are no common words with A at position4 and only consonants? Without the excluded vowels? Because the letters around might require vowels? But we don't have other vowels? So maybe position4 is rare? Or position5.

Position5: words ending with A? Like ""pizza"", but I excluded? ""plaza"": P,L,A,Z,A -> A at3 and5? Not5 only? We need the last letter to be A? So ""pizza"" has A at5? But I excluded? ""pizza"" is P,I,Z,Z,A -> so A at5? But I is excluded? So invalid.

""vodka"": V,O,D,K,A -> O and D excluded? No.

""sauna"": S,A,U,N,A -> U and N excluded? No.

""arena"": A,R,E,N,A -> excluded.

""china"": C,H,I,N,A -> excluded.

""kappa"": K,A,P,P,A -> A at2 and5? Not5 only.

""alpha"": A,L,P,H,A -> A at1 and5.

""beta"": not 5.

""theta"": T,H,E,T,A -> E excluded.

""quota"": Q,U,O,T,A -> U and O excluded.

""vista"": V,I,S,T,A -> I excluded.

""fella"": F,E,L,L,A -> E excluded.

""villa"": V,I,L,L,A -> I excluded.

""ultra"": U,L,T,R,A -> U and R excluded.

""extra"": E,X,T,R,A -> E and R excluded.

""opera"": O,P,E,R,A -> O, E, R excluded.

So no common words ending with A that fit the constraints? Because they often have vowels in the middle? Which are excluded.

Therefore, the only feasible position for A in the next guess is position 2? Or we have to use a word with A at position 2? And then we can test.

So we go with ""salty"".

But let's confirm: ""salty"" uses S, A, L, T, Y? All available? Yes.

And A at position 2? Which is a candidate position.

If we get A at position 2 correct? Then we know A is at 2? If not, then A must be at 4 or 5? But we haven't tested 4 or 5? So we'll know.

Also, we get feedback on S, L, T, Y? Which are new.

So I think that's a good guess.

Therefore, we guess ""salty"".

But note: we have to write the guess in the format.

So:

<thinking>
From the feedback:
- A is present but not at position 1 or 3, so it must be at 2, 4, or 5.
- The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, so available letters are A, B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word with A at position 2, 4, or 5. However, words with A at 4 or 5 are difficult to form with the available letters without using excluded vowels. Therefore, we choose a word with A at position 2 to test that position.

""salty"" is chosen because:
- It has A at position 2.
- It uses common letters: S, L, T, and Y (which is less common but acceptable).
- All letters are distinct and from the available set.

This guess will help us determine if A is at position 2 and provide information on S, L, T, Y.

<guess>salty</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
  - C, R, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - A is **present** but **not in position 3**.  

- **Guess 2: ""audio"" → Feedback: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)**  
  - A is **present** but **not in position 1** (since it was marked as ""-"" in position 1).  
  - U, D, I, O are **absent** from the secret word.  

### Key Deductions
1. **A must be in the secret word** at position 2, 4, or 5 (since it cannot be at 1 or 3).  
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. These cannot appear in the secret word.  
3. **Possible letters**: A, B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. The secret word **must include A** and likely consists of consonants from the remaining letters, as all other vowels (E, I, O, U) are excluded.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Focus on position 2 for A**: Since A cannot be at positions 1 or 3, testing position 2 is efficient. If A is correct at position 2, we lock in its location. If not, we narrow A to positions 4 or 5.  
- **Test new high-frequency consonants**: Prioritize common letters like S, T, L, M to maximize information gain.  
- **Avoid redundant positions**: Do not place A at position 1 or 3 (known incorrect) or reuse absent letters.  
- **Word selection**: Choose a valid 5-letter word with A at position 2, using distinct letters from the available set to cover more ground.  

### Chosen Guess: ""salty""
- **Why ""salty""?**  
  - A is at position 2 (testing a candidate position).  
  - Uses common consonants: S (position 1), L (position 3), T (position 4), and Y (position 5).  
  - All letters are distinct and from the available set (S, A, L, T, Y).  
  - Tests high-frequency letters: S, T, and L are among the most common consonants in English.  
  - If A is not at position 2, feedback will confirm A must be at 4 or 5, and we gain data on S, L, T, Y.

Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.\n\nFor the second guess, we need a 5-letter word that:\n1. Includes the letter A (because A was present, but in the wrong position). However, note that A cannot be in position 3 (since that\'s where we guessed it and got ""-"", meaning it\'s present but not there). In our guess ""crane"", the A was at position 3 (index 2? Let\'s note: if we index 1-based: position 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E). So A must be in the word but not at position 3.\n\n2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E since they are marked as absent.\n\nAdditionally, we should choose a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.\n\nNow, we have to form a new 5-letter word without C, R, N, E and with an A that is not in position 3.\n\nLet me list some common letters that are not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe have the constraint on A: it must be in the word and not in position 3.\n\nPossible positions for A in our new guess: 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know the correct position of A yet. It could be in one of the other positions.\n\nWe should also try to include letters that haven\'t been tested yet to get new information.\n\nLet\'s think of words that include A and avoid the excluded letters.\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n\n- ""salt"": but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So not.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""spalt""? Not a word.\n- ""blast"": has A, but in position 2? And it avoids C,R,N,E? Let\'s check: B, L, A, S, T -> no C,R,N,E. But we don\'t know about these letters yet.\n\nWe want to cover more vowels? We know E is out, but I and O are still possibilities.\n\nAnother idea: ""audio""? But that has A and I, O, U. However, U is not excluded. But wait, we have only 5 positions: A at position 1? Then U, D, I, O. But we must avoid C,R,N,E.\n\nProblem: ""audio"" has U, D, I, O. That would be: A in position 1, then U in 2, D in 3, I in 4, O in 5? But we are not sure about these letters. Also, note our first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but in ""audio"", A is at position 1. Since we have a ""-"" for A in position 3, we expect that the A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5 in the actual word? Not necessarily: the ""-"" only means that A is in the word but not at position 3. It doesn\'t forbid A to be at position 1,2,4,5? Actually, it doesn\'t tell us about the other positions. So we must include A in our new guess? Actually, we don\'t have to, because we know A is in the word. So we must include A. Yes, because we have a ""-"" meaning it\'s present.\n\nSo in our new guess, we must include A. Otherwise, we cannot rule out positions? Actually, we need to find the correct position.\n\nBut also note: we have eliminated many vowels: E is out, A is in. So we might want to test other vowels: I, O, U.\n\nFor vowels, we know E is out, so the secret word must have one or more of A, I, O, U (with A already confirmed).\n\nNow, let\'s think of words with A and without C,R,N,E.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""stalk"": S,T,A,L,K -> A is at position 3? But wait, we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that in position 3 it was wrong? No! Wait: we guessed A at position 3 and it was absent (but the ""-"" means the letter is in the word but not at that position). So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it would be wrong because the correct word does not have A at position 3. Therefore, to avoid redundant information, we should not put A at position 3 again. Actually, we could put it at position 3 and we\'d get an ""x"" (since it\'s not correct) but we already know it\'s not at position 3. So it\'s better not to because we wouldn\'t get new information about the position? Actually, we would get an ""x"" for that position? But no: if we put A at position 3, we know it will be ""-"" only if A is in the word but not there? We already know that. But by putting it again at 3, we don\'t learn anything about position 3. Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A in the second guess? Yes.\n\nSo in the new guess, A should not be at position 3.\n\nThus, A must be at one of positions: 1,2,4,5.\n\nNow, let\'s build a word:\n\nOption 1: place A in position 1: words starting with A? Without C,R,N,E.\n\nExamples: ""about"": A,B,O,U,T -> but we have B,O,U,T. Also, we haven\'t tested B,O,U,T. So that\'s fine? But ""u"" is not tested? We can use this.\n\nBut note: ""about"" has the letter O and U? Which are new.\n\nOption 2: place A in position 2: like ""lapse""? But ""lapse"" has E? E is excluded. So no.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nSo ""lapse"" is invalid because of E.\n\nAnother: ""pasta""? P,A,S,T,A -> duplicate A? But the word ""pasta"" has two A\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters? The feedback didn\'t indicate that. But in ""pasta"", at position 2 and 5. Our feedback rule: for a word with duplicate letters, the feedback may be tricky? Actually, we have to consider the rules.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now to keep it simpler? Or it might be acceptable.\n\nBut ""pasta"" has A at positions 2 and 5. We are interested in the A: we could learn about position 2? But we don\'t have to avoid duplicates necessarily.\n\nWe\'ll pick words without duplicates? But the secret word may have duplicates, so we can.\n\nBut for second guess, let\'s try a word with distinct letters? To maximize information.\n\nSo ""about"": A (position1), B, O, U, T -> distinct letters? Yes: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""admit"": A (position1), D, M, I, T -> distinct letters? Yes.\n\nNow, ""admit"" includes M and I? Also good.\n\nBut we are avoiding E? Yes.\n\nAlso, ""aisle"": but that has S,L,E? E is excluded -> so no.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nSo ""admit"" is good.\n\nAnother: ""aloft"": A (position1), L, O, F, T -> distinct.\n\nOr ""atoll"": but duplicate L? And not a common word? Actually, Wordle uses more common words.\n\nBut let\'s stick with common words.\n\nAnother option: place A in position 4? Such as ""delta""? But ""delta"" has E? Excluded -> no.\n\n""coral""? But we excluded C (and C is the first letter) -> no.\n\nSo position 1 is easier for building words.\n\nPosition 2: words like ""waist""? but has S,T and avoids C,R,N,E? But W,A,I,S,T -> distinct? Yes.\n\nBut A is at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""paint"": has T and avoids C,R,N,E? P,A,I,N,T -> wait, N is excluded? We have N in ""paint""? But we know N is absent. So we cannot use N. Must avoid N.\n\nSo we cannot use ""paint"" because of N.\n\nSo we have to remember: avoid C,R,N,E.\n\nTherefore, for the second guess, we must choose from letters excluding C,R,N,E and including A.\n\nSo set of available letters: A, and then B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe also want to test new vowels: I, O, U.\n\nAnd avoid putting A at position 3.\n\nNow, let me think of a word that incorporates these.\n\nCommon second guesses could be:\n\n- ""about"": A (pos1), B, O, U, T -> good? Yes: A, B, O, U, T -> all letters not previously tried? Only A is confirmed to be present. Others are fresh.\n\n- ""admit"": A, D, M, I, T -> and I is a vowel.\n\n- ""aloft"": A, L, O, F, T\n\nAnother one: ""aegis"" has E? excluded.\n\nAmong these, I think ""admit"" is a good choice because we test two vowels: I and also O? No, in ""admit"" we have I? But not O? Actually, ""admit"" has I? Yes, at position 4? But then we test I.\n\n""about"" has O and U.\n\nSince we haven\'t tested any vowels except A and E (which is absent), it would be good to test I and O? So ""admit"" tests I? But what about O? It doesn\'t.\n\nAlternatively, ""audio"" would be good: A, U, D, I, O -> all vowels? We have A,U,I,O? And D? But we are limited to 5 letters: ""audio"" is valid? Yes: A,U,D,I,O.\n\nLet me confirm: A at position 1, U at 2, D at 3? Then I at 4, O at 5.\n\nBut we cannot use position 3 for A? Well, in this case A is at position1, so not position3.\n\nBut D is at position3? We don\'t know about D. But note: we must avoid C,R,N,E? ""audio"" contains: A,U,D,I,O -> all these are not forbidden? Yes.\n\nAnd it uses the vowels A, I, O, and U? Actually, A is already known to be in the word, and testing I and O? Also U? That\'s good.\n\nBut what about consonants? We are not testing consonants? Also, we have D, which is a consonant? But we need to see.\n\nThe word ""audio"" is typically accepted in word games? I believe so.\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on each letter: A, U, D, I, O.\n\nA is known to be in the word? But at position1: if it\'s correct, we get ""✓"", if not, then it might be ""-"" or not? Actually, we know A is in the word? But we don\'t know its position? So by testing A at position1, we can check if it\'s at 1? Similarly for other vowels.\n\nBut there is a potential issue: what if A is actually at position2? Then we might not test position2? But we\'ll see.\n\nAlternatively, to get more consonant information? It\'s up to us.\n\nWe can also choose a word like ""stain"": but S,T,A,I,N -> but N is excluded? No. So cannot.\n\n""point"": no A? Also, we must include A? Actually, we must include A because we know it is in the secret word? Otherwise, we are not confirming any location? Actually, we don\'t have to? But without A, we don\'t gain information about the position of A? That\'s true. Also, we are not forced to include A? But then we are not using the known information.\n\nSince we have only 5 guesses left? Actually, we started with 6, so after first guess, we have 5 remaining? But we must be efficient.\n\nSo it is beneficial to include A and try it in a new position.\n\nTherefore, let me choose between:\n\n1. ""about"": tests A (pos1), B (consonant), O (vowel), U (vowel), T (consonant). \n2. ""admit"": tests A (pos1), D (consonant), M (consonant), I (vowel), T (consonant). \n3. ""audio"": tests A,U,D,I,O -> all? And also covers vowels.\n\nBut ""audio"" uses four vowels? Which might be a bit extreme? And only one consonant? Maybe not ideal? Because the secret word might have a mix? But possible.\n\nActually, the word ""audio"" is commonly used as a guess because it has four vowels and one consonant? Or three vowels? A, U, I, O: that\'s four vowels? No: A, U, I, O — that\'s four vowels? Actually, A, U, I, O are vowels? And D is consonant.\n\nBut in Wordle, vowel-heavy words can help eliminate vowels.\n\nBut note: we already know E is absent? So testing I and O? And U? Is good? Because A is present? But we don\'t know about I, O, U.\n\nSo it might be efficient? Yes.\n\nI think ""audio"" is a valid choice? And it avoids the excluded letters? Let\'s see: excluded: C,R,N,E. No: ""audio"" has none of these.\n\nBut note: there\'s no position conflict? We are putting A at position1? And not position3? That\'s okay.\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word with A not at position1? To test other positions? For example, if A is at position4? So we can test.\n\nBut ""audio"" is fine.\n\nAnother word: ""sault""? Not really? How about ""sauna""? But has U,A? But duplicate A? And N? N is excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo perhaps ""audio"" is a good candidate.\n\nAlternatively, ""about"" tests two consonants and two new vowels? Also good.\n\nNow, comparing: ""audio"" tests I and O? But in one word: four vowels? That\'s a lot? But we get information about these.\n\nAnother candidate: ""atoll""? Has duplicate L? And not common? Avoid.\n\n""avoid"": A, V, O, I, D -> distinct letters? Yes: A,V,O,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. So ""avoid"" is another option? And it has V? Which is less common? Might be risky.\n\nBut ""audio"" is more common? Definitely.\n\nTo be safe, I\'ll go with ""audio"".\n\nAlso, let\'s note: in ""audio"", A is at position1? So if A in the secret word is at position1, we get true? If not, we get ""-""? But we already know it\'s not at position3? So we are testing position1.\n\nMoreover, we are testing U at position2? Which might be correct? Or not.\n\nSimilarly, D at position3? Which we have no information? Etc.\n\nBut ""audio"" has the advantage of being a word with four vowels? So if the feedback shows that some vowels are missing? We eliminate quickly.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""audio"".\n\nSo:\n\nGuessed word: audio\n\nBut note: A is at position1? No: let me spell: \nPosition1: A\nPosition2: U\nPosition3: D\nPosition4: I\nPosition5: O\n\nGood.\n\nSo we\'ll output:\n\n<guess>audio</guess>\n\nBut before that, we need to write the thought process? In the tags.\n\nWe\'ll do:\n\n<thinking>\nFirst guess was ""crane"" with feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x). This means:\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n- A is in the word, but not at position 3.\n\nFor the second guess, we need a word that includes A (but not at position 3) and avoids C, R, N, E.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nWe want to test other common vowels (like I, O, U) since E is not present.\n\nAfter considering words like ""about"", ""admit"", and ""audio"", we choose ""audio"" because:\n- It uses vowels A, U, I, and O, which are new and not tested.\n- It avoids the excluded letters C, R, N, E.\n- Word ""audio"" is a common word and helps in getting vowel information efficiently.\n\nThus, our next guess is ""audio"".The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" shows:\n- A is present but not in position 3.\n- C, R, N, E are absent and excluded from the word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include A since it\'s in the word (but avoid position 3).\n- Must exclude C, R, N, E.\n- To gather new information, focus on common letters not yet tested, especially vowels (I, O, U) and consonants like B, D, K, L, M, S, T.\n- Prioritize testing A in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5) along with other untested vowels to efficiently determine their presence/absence.\n\nAfter evaluating options like ""about"" (tests A at position 1, B, O, U, T), ""admit"" (tests A at position 1, D, M, I, T), and ""audio"", the word ""audio"" is selected because:\n- It tests A at position 1 (a new position) and three untested vowels (U, I, O).\n- All letters (A, U, D, I, O) are distinct and avoid excluded letters (C, R, N, E).\n- Covering multiple vowels in one guess efficiently provides feedback on vowel presence/position, narrowing down consonant possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>audio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.\n- A is present but not in position 3.\n\nGuess 2: ""audio"" -> A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is present but not in position 1 (since we guessed A at position 1 and got ""-"", meaning it\'s in the word but not there).\n- U, D, I, O are absent from the secret word.\n\nNow, combining the information:\n\nFrom guess 1: A is present and not at position 3.\nFrom guess 2: A is present and not at position 1.\n\nTherefore, A must be in the secret word at position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nAlso, the absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nSo the secret word does not contain any of: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nNow, what letters are possible? We have the alphabet minus the absent ones.\n\nAbsent: C, D, E, I, N, O, R, U.\n\nSo available letters: A, B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: A is present, so it must be included, and we know it\'s at position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that includes A (at position 2, 4, or 5) and uses only the available letters.\n\nAlso, we want to maximize information by testing new letters and avoiding duplicates? But we don\'t know about duplicates? So we can use distinct letters? But the secret word might have duplicates? So we can use a word with distinct letters to test more.\n\nNow, we have to consider the position of A: we know it\'s not at 1 or 3, so we should try it at a new position? For example, position 2? Or 4? Or 5.\n\nWe have three positions to test? We can choose one.\n\nAlso, we have many consonants left? We should test common ones? Like S, T, L, etc.\n\nLet\'s list the available consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nAnd we have A as the only vowel? Because E, I, O, U are out? So the secret word must have A and then consonants? Or possibly Y? Which can be a vowel? But in Wordle, Y is often considered a consonant? Or sometimes vowel? It depends? But we can use Y.\n\nBut note: the secret word must have at least one vowel? And we have A? So that\'s covered? But we don\'t know about Y? It could be used as a vowel? But we have to see.\n\nBut for now, we focus on the available letters.\n\nWe need to form a word that has A at position 2, 4, or 5? And the other positions from the available consonants.\n\nBut we don\'t know which position A is in? So we have to choose a word that places A in one of these positions? And then we get feedback? If we get A at position 2 correct? Then we know? Otherwise, if not, then it must be at 4 or 5? Etc.\n\nSo let\'s think of words that have A at position 2? For example.\n\nPosition 2: _ A _ _ _\n\nWith available letters? So first letter: from available? Then A at 2? Then third, fourth, fifth.\n\nSimilarly for position 4: _ _ _ A _\n\nOr position 5: _ _ _ _ A\n\nNow, we should choose a word that uses common letters? To increase the chance of hits.\n\nAlso, we want to test as many new letters as possible? Since we have 18 available letters? But we can only use 5? So we choose 5 that are common.\n\nCommon letters left: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, etc.\n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nFirst, if we put A at position 2: then the word is ? A ? ? ?\n\nPossible words: \n- ""salts""? But S is available? But ""salts"" has duplicate S? And 5 letters? S,A,L,T,S -> duplicate S? Not ideal? But we can? But let\'s avoid duplicates? For information? So better distinct.\n\n""salty"": S,A,L,T,Y -> distinct? Yes. And Y is available? Yes.\n\nBut we have to check if Y is allowed? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""palsy"": P,A,L,S,Y -> distinct? Yes.\n\n""balsa"": B,A,L,S,A -> duplicate A? But we don\'t know if A is duplicated? But in this case, we have A at position 2 and 5? But we are testing A at position 2? And if the secret word has only one A? Then we might get feedback? But it\'s okay? But we are trying to find the position? So having A at two positions might be confusing? But we can.\n\nBut to keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicate A? Because we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? But we can try.\n\nBut for now, let\'s choose a word with A only once? And at position 2? For example.\n\n""salty"": S,A,L,T,Y -> positions: S1, A2, L3, T4, Y5.\n\nBut we know A is not at position 3? But here A is at 2? So that\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, ""tally"": T,A,L,L,Y -> duplicate L? Not distinct.\n\n""fatal"": F,A,T,A,L -> duplicate A? Not good.\n\n""gawky"": G,A,W,K,Y -> distinct? Yes.\n\nBut ""gawky"" is a word? Yes.\n\nNow, if we put A at position 4: then word is ? ? ? A ?\n\nFor example: ""blast""? But B,L,A,S,T -> A at position 3? Not 4? We need A at 4.\n\n""lasts"": L,A,S,T,S -> A at 2? Not 4.\n\n""data"": not 5 letters.\n\n""pasta"": P,A,S,T,A -> A at 2 and 5? Not at 4.\n\n""cabal"": but C is excluded? No.\n\n""focal"": F,O,C,A,L -> O and C excluded? No.\n\n""vista"": V,I,S,T,A -> I is excluded? No, I is absent? So cannot.\n\n""vista"" has I? Which is absent? So invalid.\n\n""manta"": M,A,N,T,A -> N excluded? And duplicate A? No.\n\n""panda"": P,A,N,D,A -> N and D excluded? No.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find a word with A at position 4? Because many words have A at the beginning or end? Or with vowels? But we don\'t have other vowels? Because I,O,U are out? So we need a word with A at 4? And consonants elsewhere.\n\nFor example: ""delta"" but E and D excluded? No.\n\n""alpha"": A,L,P,H,A -> A at 1 and 5? Not 4.\n\n""kappa"": K,A,P,P,A -> duplicate P and A? Not 4.\n\n""llama"": L,L,A,M,A -> duplicates.\n\n""sigma"": S,I,G,M,A -> I excluded? No.\n\n""drama"": D,R,A,M,A -> D and R excluded? No.\n\nSo perhaps position 4 is difficult? Let\'s try position 5: _ _ _ _ A\n\nThen words: ""pizza"": P,I,Z,Z,A -> I excluded? No.\n\n""plaza"": P,L,A,Z,A -> A at 3 and 5? Not 5 only? We need A at 5? So last letter A.\n\n""puma"": not 5 letters.\n\n""tibia"": T,I,B,I,A -> I excluded? No.\n\n""china"": C,H,I,N,A -> C, I, N excluded? No.\n\n""arena"": A,R,E,N,A -> R, E, N excluded? And A at 1 and 5? Not 5 only.\n\n""fella"": F,E,L,L,A -> E excluded? No.\n\n""villa"": V,I,L,L,A -> I excluded? No.\n\n""extra"": E,X,T,R,A -> E and R excluded? No.\n\n""ultra"": U,L,T,R,A -> U and R excluded? No.\n\nSo it seems that with the constraints, words with A at position 4 or 5 are hard to find? Because they often include excluded vowels or consonants.\n\nTherefore, position 2 might be easier? So let\'s go with A at position 2.\n\nSo words like: ? A ? ? ?\n\nWith available letters? And distinct? If possible.\n\n""salty"": S,A,L,T,Y -> distinct? Yes. And S, L, T, Y are all available? Yes.\n\n""balmy"": B,A,L,M,Y -> distinct? Yes.\n\n""gawky"": G,A,W,K,Y -> distinct? Yes.\n\n""happy"": H,A,P,P,Y -> duplicate P? Not distinct.\n\n""jazzy"": J,A,Z,Z,Y -> duplicate Z? Not distinct.\n\n""tabby"": T,A,B,B,Y -> duplicate B? Not distinct.\n\nSo ""salty"", ""balmy"", ""gawky"" are good.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test common letters? S, T, L are more common than W, K, Y? So ""salty"" might be better? Because S, L, T are very common.\n\n""salty"": S at position1, A at2, L at3, T at4, Y at5.\n\nWe know that position3 is not A? But we are putting L at3? Which is fine? We don\'t know about L.\n\nSimilarly, position1: S? We don\'t know.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters? We are.\n\nSo I think ""salty"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that tests more common letters? Like M? Or P?\n\n""palsy"": P,A,L,S,Y -> distinct? P,A,L,S,Y -> yes. And P, L, S, Y are available? Yes.\n\n""palsy"" is a word? Yes, meaning a condition or a village? But in Wordle, it might be accepted? I think so.\n\nBut ""salty"" is more common? And has T? Which is very common.\n\n""salty"" has T? Yes, at position4.\n\nSimilarly, ""tally"" has duplicate L? Not.\n\nAnother: ""fancy"" but C and N excluded? No.\n\nSo I think ""salty"" is fine.\n\nBut we have to consider: in ""salty"", we are putting A at position2? And we know A is not at1 or3? So position2 is a candidate? If we get A at2 correct? Then we know? Otherwise, if not, then A must be at4 or5? But we are not testing position4 or5? So we might need another guess? But that\'s okay.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that has A at position4? But we had difficulty? Let me try again.\n\nWhat about ""blast""? But A at position3? Not allowed? Because we know A is not at3? So we cannot put A at3? Because it would be wrong? And we know it? So we must avoid position3 for A? So we cannot use a word with A at3? Because it will be ""-"" and we already know? So it\'s redundant? But we can? But it doesn\'t give new information? So better to avoid.\n\nTherefore, only positions 2,4,5.\n\nNow, for position4: let\'s find a word.\n\n""swath"": S,W,A,T,H -> A at position3? Not 4? We need A at4.\n\n""swath"" is S,W,A,T,H -> positions: S1, W2, A3, T4, H5? So A at3? Not 4.\n\n""tract"": T,R,A,C,T -> R and C excluded? And A at3.\n\n""cramp"": C,R,A,M,P -> excluded.\n\n""draft"": D,R,A,F,T -> D and R excluded.\n\n""graft"": G,R,A,F,T -> R excluded.\n\n""kraft"": K,R,A,F,T -> R excluded.\n\n""wafer"": W,A,F,E,R -> E and R excluded.\n\n""waist"": W,A,I,S,T -> I excluded? And A at2.\n\n""yeast"": Y,E,A,S,T -> E excluded.\n\n""beast"": B,E,A,S,T -> E excluded.\n\n""least"": L,E,A,S,T -> E excluded.\n\n""feast"": F,E,A,S,T -> E excluded.\n\n""blast"": B,L,A,S,T -> A at3? But we cannot put A at3? Because we know it\'s not there? So if we put A at3, we get ""-"" and we know? So it\'s not useful? But we can avoid.\n\nBut we need A at4? So let\'s find words ending with A? But that\'s position5? Or with A at4.\n\n""llama"" not.\n\n""comma"": C,O,M,M,A -> C and O excluded.\n\n""gamma"": G,A,M,M,A -> A at2 and5? Not4.\n\n""drama"": D,R,A,M,A -> excluded.\n\n""mamma"": M,A,M,M,A -> duplicates.\n\n""sigma"": S,I,G,M,A -> I excluded.\n\n""dogma"": D,O,G,M,A -> D and O excluded.\n\n""lemma"": L,E,M,M,A -> E excluded.\n\nSo it\'s very hard? Perhaps there are no common words with A at position4 and only consonants? Without the excluded vowels? Because the letters around might require vowels? But we don\'t have other vowels? So maybe position4 is rare? Or position5.\n\nPosition5: words ending with A? Like ""pizza"", but I excluded? ""plaza"": P,L,A,Z,A -> A at3 and5? Not5 only? We need the last letter to be A? So ""pizza"" has A at5? But I excluded? ""pizza"" is P,I,Z,Z,A -> so A at5? But I is excluded? So invalid.\n\n""vodka"": V,O,D,K,A -> O and D excluded? No.\n\n""sauna"": S,A,U,N,A -> U and N excluded? No.\n\n""arena"": A,R,E,N,A -> excluded.\n\n""china"": C,H,I,N,A -> excluded.\n\n""kappa"": K,A,P,P,A -> A at2 and5? Not5 only.\n\n""alpha"": A,L,P,H,A -> A at1 and5.\n\n""beta"": not 5.\n\n""theta"": T,H,E,T,A -> E excluded.\n\n""quota"": Q,U,O,T,A -> U and O excluded.\n\n""vista"": V,I,S,T,A -> I excluded.\n\n""fella"": F,E,L,L,A -> E excluded.\n\n""villa"": V,I,L,L,A -> I excluded.\n\n""ultra"": U,L,T,R,A -> U and R excluded.\n\n""extra"": E,X,T,R,A -> E and R excluded.\n\n""opera"": O,P,E,R,A -> O, E, R excluded.\n\nSo no common words ending with A that fit the constraints? Because they often have vowels in the middle? Which are excluded.\n\nTherefore, the only feasible position for A in the next guess is position 2? Or we have to use a word with A at position 2? And then we can test.\n\nSo we go with ""salty"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: ""salty"" uses S, A, L, T, Y? All available? Yes.\n\nAnd A at position 2? Which is a candidate position.\n\nIf we get A at position 2 correct? Then we know A is at 2? If not, then A must be at 4 or 5? But we haven\'t tested 4 or 5? So we\'ll know.\n\nAlso, we get feedback on S, L, T, Y? Which are new.\n\nSo I think that\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""salty"".\n\nBut note: we have to write the guess in the format.\n\nSo:\n\n<thinking>\nFrom the feedback:\n- A is present but not at position 1 or 3, so it must be at 2, 4, or 5.\n- The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, so available letters are A, B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need a word with A at position 2, 4, or 5. However, words with A at 4 or 5 are difficult to form with the available letters without using excluded vowels. Therefore, we choose a word with A at position 2 to test that position.\n\n""salty"" is chosen because:\n- It has A at position 2.\n- It uses common letters: S, L, T, and Y (which is less common but acceptable).\n- All letters are distinct and from the available set.\n\nThis guess will help us determine if A is at position 2 and provide information on S, L, T, Y.\n\n<guess>salty</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  \n  - C, R, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.  \n  - A is **present** but **not in position 3**.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""audio"" → Feedback: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)**  \n  - A is **present** but **not in position 1** (since it was marked as ""-"" in position 1).  \n  - U, D, I, O are **absent** from the secret word.  \n\n### Key Deductions\n1. **A must be in the secret word** at position 2, 4, or 5 (since it cannot be at 1 or 3).  \n2. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O. These cannot appear in the secret word.  \n3. **Possible letters**: A, B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n4. The secret word **must include A** and likely consists of consonants from the remaining letters, as all other vowels (E, I, O, U) are excluded.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess\n- **Focus on position 2 for A**: Since A cannot be at positions 1 or 3, testing position 2 is efficient. If A is correct at position 2, we lock in its location. If not, we narrow A to positions 4 or 5.  \n- **Test new high-frequency consonants**: Prioritize common letters like S, T, L, M to maximize information gain.  \n- **Avoid redundant positions**: Do not place A at position 1 or 3 (known incorrect) or reuse absent letters.  \n- **Word selection**: Choose a valid 5-letter word with A at position 2, using distinct letters from the available set to cover more ground.  \n\n### Chosen Guess: ""salty""\n- **Why ""salty""?**  \n  - A is at position 2 (testing a candidate position).  \n  - Uses common consonants: S (position 1), L (position 3), T (position 4), and Y (position 5).  \n  - All letters are distinct and from the available set (S, A, L, T, Y).  \n  - Tests high-frequency letters: S, T, and L are among the most common consonants in English.  \n  - If A is not at position 2, feedback will confirm A must be at 4 or 5, and we gain data on S, L, T, Y.\n\n<guess>salty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E absent.
- A present but not at position 3.

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> Feedback: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
Meaning:
- A present but not at position 1.
- U, D, I, O absent.

From these, we deduced:
- A cannot be at position 1 or 3, so must be at 2, 4, or 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

Then Guess 3: ""salty"" -> Feedback: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(✓) Y(✓)
Meaning:
- S absent (x): so S is not in the word.
- A at position 2 is correct (✓): so secret word has A at position 2.
- L absent (x): so L is not in the word.
- T at position 4 is correct (✓): so secret word has T at position 4.
- Y at position 5 is correct (✓): so secret word has Y at position 5.

Therefore, we now know:
- Positions: 
  - Position 2: A (because A(✓) at position 2)
  - Position 4: T (because T(✓) at position 4)
  - Position 5: Y (because Y(✓) at position 5)
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, S, L (from new feedback S(x) and L(x))
- Also, from guess 1 and 2, we had other absent letters.

So total absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, S, L.

Now, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown, but it cannot be any of the absent letters.
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: unknown
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: Y

Also, the word must include only letters not absent.

Available letters: A, B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. But note:
- A, T, Y are already placed? But we might need to consider if there are more occurrences? But we don't know? The feedback for A, T, Y shows they are correct in their positions? But what about other occurrences? Since we have A at position 2, T at 4, Y at 5, and we don't know positions 1 and 3.

But we also don't know if there are duplicate letters? However, with only positions 1 and 3 unknown, and we know these two letters must be from the available set, excluding the absent ones.

Moreover, we must ensure that position 1 and 3 are letters that complete a valid English word.

So the word has the form: _ A _ T Y

Where the first blank is position 1 and the third blank is position 3.

And the unknown letters cannot be: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, S, L.

So available letters for position 1 and 3: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But note: the word must be valid English word? So we need to find words that fit _A_TY.

Now, what are possible words? Let's think of words ending with ""A T Y""? Actually, ending with ""TY""? But with A at second position and T fourth? Y fifth? So pattern is *A*TY.

Examples: 
- ""party"": P,A,R,T,Y -> but R is absent? And we have R in absent letters? From guess 1, R is absent? So ""party"" invalid.
- ""dirty"": D,I,R,T,Y -> D, I, R absent? No.
- ""nasty"": N,A,S,T,Y -> N and S absent? No.
- ""hasty"": H,A,S,T,Y -> S absent? Yes? From guess 3, S is absent? So invalid.
- ""pasty"": P,A,S,T,Y -> S absent? No.
- ""tasty"": T,A,S,T,Y -> S absent? And also duplicate T? T at position1? But we have T at position4? But the word ""tasty"" has two T's? We don't know if it's allowed? But in feedback, we already know T is at position4? So if we have T at position1? Then it might be present? But in our pattern, we have *A*TY, so position1 and position3 must be filled.

Another one: ""marty""? Not a word? Or name? Probably not.

""batty"": B,A,T,T,Y -> T at position3? But we need T at position4? Pattern: B A T T Y? Position1: B, position2: A, position3: T, position4:T? Position5:Y? But we have T at position3 and position4? And Y at5? But our pattern expects position4 to be T? Which is correct? But we have an extra T? But that's okay? The word ""batty"" has T at position3 and4? But our known position4 is T? So position3 is T? That would mean T is duplicated? And position3 is T? Which isn't placed? But we don't know it? However, our pattern must have position4 as T? So if we have T at position3, we don't know? But it's possible.

But in ""batty"": pattern: position1: B, position2: A, position3: T, position4: T, position5: Y. That matches our pattern: _A_TY? Position3 is T? Then the word is B A T T Y, so at position3 it's T? But we don't have information about position3 yet? So it could be? If the secret word is ""batty"", then it would have T at position3 and4? Then in guess 3 ""salty"", which had S,A,L,T,Y: for position3: L which is absent? Correct? And position4: T is correct? So that fits? But we don't know about position3.

Similarly, another possibility: ""fatty"": F,A,T,T,Y -> same as above? T at position3 and4.

But position3 would be T? And T is now in the word? But we thought position4 had T? But it can have multiple T's? Yes.

But also, position1: F? Or B? Etc.

We must check the feedback from previous guesses? Do we have any constraint against T at position3? Not yet.

Also, is T absent? No, from guess3, we have T at position4 marked correct? So T is in the word? And we don't know about other positions? So it can be duplicated.

Similarly, A and Y are also placed? But they might not be duplicated? But we don't know.

Now, let's list possible words:

- Looking for 5-letter words ending with ""TY""? But with second letter A? So pattern: ?A?TY.

Possible:
- ""batty"": B,A,T,T,Y
- ""catty"": C,A,T,T,Y -> but C absent? Invalid.
- ""fatty"": F,A,T,T,Y
- ""patty"": P,A,T,T,Y
- ""ratty"": R,A,T,T,Y -> R absent? Invalid.
- ""tatty"": T,A,T,T,Y -> T in position1? But we don't know? And duplicate T's? Okay? But position1 T? Is T allowed? T is not absent? So yes.
- ""matty"": M,A,T,T,Y -> not common? But exists? Yes.

Also:
- ""daddy"": D,A,D,D,Y -> D absent? And letters? Position3 is D? D absent? Invalid.
- ""savvy"": S,A,V,V,Y -> S absent? And no T? Position4 must be T? Pattern requires T at4? So not matching.

Another possibility: without duplicate T, but then position3 must be a letter that works? 

For example: ""bawty""? Not a word? Or ""gawty""? Not common.

""panty"": P,A,N,T,Y -> N absent? Invalid.

""hasty"": H,A,S,T,Y -> S absent? No.

""pasty"": P,A,S,T,Y -> S absent? No.

So almost all words matching this pattern have T at position3? Like double T?

Another word: ""bahty""? Not common.

""caput"": Not ending with TY.

It seems that the only common words are those with double T? Like ""batty"", ""fatty"", ""patty"", ""tatty"", ""matty"", etc.

But ""tatty"": T,A,T,T,Y -> position1: T? Position3: T, position4: T? So three T's? Position3 and4? But we have position4 as T? Position3 as T? Then position1 as T? So multiple T's.

But in our pattern, we have position4 T and position5 Y? So for position1 and3, they can be any available letters? But in ""tatty"", position1: T, position2: A, position3: T, position4: T, position5: Y? Then position1 is T? But in guess3 ""salty"", we guessed S at position1? Which was absent? So S is absent? But T is present? So if position1 is T? It's possible? We don't know? But we have to check if T at position1 is consistent? In ""salty"", we had S at position1? Which was wrong? And we have T at position1? Then in the feedback, for ""salty"": position1: S (absent) -> correct? And position4: T correct? Position5: Y correct? So if secret word had T at position1? It's okay? Because we guessed S, not T? So no conflict.

Similarly, position3: in ""salty"" we had L? Which was absent? So if secret word has T at position3? Then L is absent? That's okay? But we didn't test T at position3? So we don't know.

Therefore, possible words: batty, fatty, patty, tatty, matty.

Now, in all these, position1 is: B, F, P, T, M? Respectively? And position3 is T? Except maybe? All have T at position3? In ""batty"": position1:B, position3:T? Then position4:T? So two T's? Similarly others.

Are there words without T at position3?

For example: ""gaudy"": G,A,U,D,Y -> U and D absent? Invalid.

""hardy"": H,A,R,D,Y -> R and D absent? Invalid.

""parky"": P,A,R,K,Y -> R absent? Invalid.

""barky"": B,A,R,K,Y -> R absent? Invalid.

""mangy"": M,A,N,G,Y -> N absent? Invalid.

So it seems that with the pattern ?A?TY and the absent letters, the only possibilities are words with ?ATTY? Meaning, position3 is T? Because if not, we cannot form a word? So pattern: ?A T T Y? But position4 is T? So the word is position1: ?, position2: A, position3: ?, position4: T, position5: Y? And we have that position3 must be a letter? If not T? But we couldn't find any without T? So likely, position3 is also T? Or in some words, but none common? So I'll assume that.

Therefore, the word has pattern: ?A T T Y? With position4:T? And position3:T? So the word is ?ATTY.

Then position1: can be one of: B, F, M, P? Since they form valid words: batty, fatty, matty, patty? Tatty also? But tatty has two T's? Position1:T.

But tatty: T,A,T,T,Y -> so it has T at position1? So pattern: T A T T Y? Which matches.

Now, the possible words: batty, fatty, patty, matty, tatty.

Now, we need to guess which one? Since we have 3 guesses left? We don't know? But we can try one? Or guess a word that differentiates? But with one letter to differentiate? Position1 is the only unknown? So we can guess one? If we are wrong? We can try another? But we can only be wrong a few times? We have 6 total guesses? We used 3? So three left? It should be okay? But we can also guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? However, since position3 is T? And we haven't tested it? But from the pattern, we are inferring it? But we are not entirely sure.

Wait: we are making an assumption that position3 must be T? Because we cannot find other words? But there might be rare words? But in Wordle, words are common? So probably the options are batty, fatty, matty, patty, tatty.

But to confirm, are there words with position3 different from T? For example, ""happy"": but Y at end? But position4? We need T at position4? ""happy"" has P at4? Not T? So wrong.

""day"": not 5 letters.

So I think it's safe to assume that position3 is T? And position1 must be one of B,F,M,P,T? But T is already used? But we can have position1:T? In tatty.

Now, the available letters for position1 must be from: B,F,M,P,T? But we don't know if these are absent or not? But we haven't tested them? So they are possible.

But in our available letters? We have: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

But for position1, in the word, it can be: B,F,M,P,T? But T? We didn't list T? Because T was tested at position4? But T is present? So we can have duplicate T? Yes? So T is allowed.

Similarly, we must consider if other letters? But from word list? Probably only these.

Possible words: 
- batty: B
- fatty: F
- matty: M
- patty: P
- tatty: T

Now, we must choose one? But we haven't tested B,F,M,P,T? So we could guess one? But perhaps we can guess a word that covers more? But since we know the pattern, we can guess one directly.

We want to choose the most common? ""party"" is excluded? So ""patty"" is common? Or ""fatty"".

But note: in the feedback, we haven't tested B,F,M,P? So we don't know? But we can guess ""batty"" or something? And based on feedback? If wrong, we guess another? But we have guesses left? Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't use T at position1? Or something? But we have to try.

But actually, if we guess ""fatty"", for example? And it's wrong? Then we know it's one of the others? So we can only eliminate one? But it's okay.

However, we might be able to guess a word that doesn't assume position3 is T? But that might not be necessary? And we waste a guess? Actually, this is a good strategy: guess one? Because if correct, we win? Otherwise, next time.

So let's choose ""patty""? As it might be common? Or we can choose based on letter frequency.

Position1 can be B,F,M,P,T? So common ones: B,F,P? M and T less? But T is already present? So perhaps not? Actually, whichever.

To maximize, perhaps ""patty""? Or ""fatty"".

But note: in ""salty"", we tested S? Which was absent? Now, we haven't tested any of these? So we can't choose based?

Perhaps we can guess a word that has a different pattern? But we are confident that the word is ?A T T Y? Or ?A?TY with the only options being double T? So I recommend guessing ""fatty"".

But when we guess, if wrong? Then we know it's one of the others? And we can try next? But it's efficient? We have enough guesses.

So we'll guess ""fatty"".

But let's confirm:

Pattern: F A T T Y? But position3:T? Which we haven't confirmed? But when we guess ""fatty"", we get feedback: 
Position1: F? If absent? Then it must be other? Position2: A? Correct? Position3: T? We expect it to be? But if it is T? Then we get feedback? Etc.

So:

<thinking>
From ""salty"" feedback: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(✓) Y(✓), we know:
- A is at position 2
- T is at position 4
- Y is at position 5
- S and L are absent
Combined with previous absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, S, L.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ A ? T Y

Since ? must be a letter that forms a valid English word and considering the constraints, common words matching ?A_ TY are ""batty,"" ""fatty,"" ""patty,"" ""matty,"" and ""tatty"" — all with ""T"" at position 3.

Possible words:
- Position 1: B (""batty""), F (""fatty""), M (""matty""), P (""patty""), T (""tatty"")
- Position 3: T (in all cases, as inferred)

To disambiguate, we guess ""fatty"" as it uses F (a common untested consonant) and tests position 1. If incorrect, we eliminate one candidate and proceed.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
   - C, R, N, E are **absent**.  
   - A is **present** but **not in position 3**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""audio"" → Feedback: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)**  
   - A is **present** but **not in position 1**.  
   - U, D, I, O are **absent**.  

3. **Guess 3: ""salty"" → Feedback: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(✓) Y(✓)**  
   - S and L are **absent**.  
   - A is **correct** at position 2.  
   - T is **correct** at position 4.  
   - Y is **correct** at position 5.  

### Key Deductions
- **Secret word pattern**: The word must be in the form: `[Position 1] A [Position 3] T Y`.  
  - Positions: 
    - 2: A (confirmed)  
    - 4: T (confirmed)  
    - 5: Y (confirmed)  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, S, L. These cannot appear.  
- **Possible letters for positions 1 and 3**: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Constraints for position 3**: Given the pattern and English language rules, valid words require position 3 to be T (forming `?A T T Y`). This is inferred because:  
  - No common English words match `?A_ TY` without T in position 3 and adhere to the absent letters (e.g., ""party"" is invalid due to R).  
  - Common words fitting `?A T T Y` include: *batty, fatty, matty, patty, tatty*.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Goal**: Test the most frequent position 1 candidate (F) while validating position 3 (T).  
- **Word choice**: ""fatty"" is optimal because:  
  - It tests F (a common untested consonant) at position 1.  
  - It assumes T at position 3 (consistent with word patterns).  
  - If correct, the word is solved. If incorrect, feedback eliminates F and the position 3 T hypothesis, narrowing to other candidates (batty, matty, patty, tatty).  

<guess>fatty</guess>",fatty,"We are given the feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E absent.
- A present but not at position 3.

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> Feedback: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
Meaning:
- A present but not at position 1.
- U, D, I, O absent.

From these, we deduced:
- A cannot be at position 1 or 3, so must be at 2, 4, or 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

Then Guess 3: ""salty"" -> Feedback: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(✓) Y(✓)
Meaning:
- S absent (x): so S is not in the word.
- A at position 2 is correct (✓): so secret word has A at position 2.
- L absent (x): so L is not in the word.
- T at position 4 is correct (✓): so secret word has T at position 4.
- Y at position 5 is correct (✓): so secret word has Y at position 5.

Therefore, we now know:
- Positions: 
  - Position 2: A (because A(✓) at position 2)
  - Position 4: T (because T(✓) at position 4)
  - Position 5: Y (because Y(✓) at position 5)
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, S, L (from new feedback S(x) and L(x))
- Also, from guess 1 and 2, we had other absent letters.

So total absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, S, L.

Now, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown, but it cannot be any of the absent letters.
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: unknown
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: Y

Also, the word must include only letters not absent.

Available letters: A, B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. But note:
- A, T, Y are already placed? But we might need to consider if there are more occurrences? But we don't know? The feedback for A, T, Y shows they are correct in their positions? But what about other occurrences? Since we have A at position 2, T at 4, Y at 5, and we don't know positions 1 and 3.

But we also don't know if there are duplicate letters? However, with only positions 1 and 3 unknown, and we know these two letters must be from the available set, excluding the absent ones.

Moreover, we must ensure that position 1 and 3 are letters that complete a valid English word.

So the word has the form: _ A _ T Y

Where the first blank is position 1 and the third blank is position 3.

And the unknown letters cannot be: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, S, L.

So available letters for position 1 and 3: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But note: the word must be valid English word? So we need to find words that fit _A_TY.

Now, what are possible words? Let's think of words ending with ""A T Y""? Actually, ending with ""TY""? But with A at second position and T fourth? Y fifth? So pattern is *A*TY.

Examples: 
- ""party"": P,A,R,T,Y -> but R is absent? And we have R in absent letters? From guess 1, R is absent? So ""party"" invalid.
- ""dirty"": D,I,R,T,Y -> D, I, R absent? No.
- ""nasty"": N,A,S,T,Y -> N and S absent? No.
- ""hasty"": H,A,S,T,Y -> S absent? Yes? From guess 3, S is absent? So invalid.
- ""pasty"": P,A,S,T,Y -> S absent? No.
- ""tasty"": T,A,S,T,Y -> S absent? And also duplicate T? T at position1? But we have T at position4? But the word ""tasty"" has two T's? We don't know if it's allowed? But in feedback, we already know T is at position4? So if we have T at position1? Then it might be present? But in our pattern, we have *A*TY, so position1 and position3 must be filled.

Another one: ""marty""? Not a word? Or name? Probably not.

""batty"": B,A,T,T,Y -> T at position3? But we need T at position4? Pattern: B A T T Y? Position1: B, position2: A, position3: T, position4:T? Position5:Y? But we have T at position3 and position4? And Y at5? But our pattern expects position4 to be T? Which is correct? But we have an extra T? But that's okay? The word ""batty"" has T at position3 and4? But our known position4 is T? So position3 is T? That would mean T is duplicated? And position3 is T? Which isn't placed? But we don't know it? However, our pattern must have position4 as T? So if we have T at position3, we don't know? But it's possible.

But in ""batty"": pattern: position1: B, position2: A, position3: T, position4: T, position5: Y. That matches our pattern: _A_TY? Position3 is T? Then the word is B A T T Y, so at position3 it's T? But we don't have information about position3 yet? So it could be? If the secret word is ""batty"", then it would have T at position3 and4? Then in guess 3 ""salty"", which had S,A,L,T,Y: for position3: L which is absent? Correct? And position4: T is correct? So that fits? But we don't know about position3.

Similarly, another possibility: ""fatty"": F,A,T,T,Y -> same as above? T at position3 and4.

But position3 would be T? And T is now in the word? But we thought position4 had T? But it can have multiple T's? Yes.

But also, position1: F? Or B? Etc.

We must check the feedback from previous guesses? Do we have any constraint against T at position3? Not yet.

Also, is T absent? No, from guess3, we have T at position4 marked correct? So T is in the word? And we don't know about other positions? So it can be duplicated.

Similarly, A and Y are also placed? But they might not be duplicated? But we don't know.

Now, let's list possible words:

- Looking for 5-letter words ending with ""TY""? But with second letter A? So pattern: ?A?TY.

Possible:
- ""batty"": B,A,T,T,Y
- ""catty"": C,A,T,T,Y -> but C absent? Invalid.
- ""fatty"": F,A,T,T,Y
- ""patty"": P,A,T,T,Y
- ""ratty"": R,A,T,T,Y -> R absent? Invalid.
- ""tatty"": T,A,T,T,Y -> T in position1? But we don't know? And duplicate T's? Okay? But position1 T? Is T allowed? T is not absent? So yes.
- ""matty"": M,A,T,T,Y -> not common? But exists? Yes.

Also:
- ""daddy"": D,A,D,D,Y -> D absent? And letters? Position3 is D? D absent? Invalid.
- ""savvy"": S,A,V,V,Y -> S absent? And no T? Position4 must be T? Pattern requires T at4? So not matching.

Another possibility: without duplicate T, but then position3 must be a letter that works? 

For example: ""bawty""? Not a word? Or ""gawty""? Not common.

""panty"": P,A,N,T,Y -> N absent? Invalid.

""hasty"": H,A,S,T,Y -> S absent? No.

""pasty"": P,A,S,T,Y -> S absent? No.

So almost all words matching this pattern have T at position3? Like double T?

Another word: ""bahty""? Not common.

""caput"": Not ending with TY.

It seems that the only common words are those with double T? Like ""batty"", ""fatty"", ""patty"", ""tatty"", ""matty"", etc.

But ""tatty"": T,A,T,T,Y -> position1: T? Position3: T, position4: T? So three T's? Position3 and4? But we have position4 as T? Position3 as T? Then position1 as T? So multiple T's.

But in our pattern, we have position4 T and position5 Y? So for position1 and3, they can be any available letters? But in ""tatty"", position1: T, position2: A, position3: T, position4: T, position5: Y? Then position1 is T? But in guess3 ""salty"", we guessed S at position1? Which was absent? So S is absent? But T is present? So if position1 is T? It's possible? We don't know? But we have to check if T at position1 is consistent? In ""salty"", we had S at position1? Which was wrong? And we have T at position1? Then in the feedback, for ""salty"": position1: S (absent) -> correct? And position4: T correct? Position5: Y correct? So if secret word had T at position1? It's okay? Because we guessed S, not T? So no conflict.

Similarly, position3: in ""salty"" we had L? Which was absent? So if secret word has T at position3? Then L is absent? That's okay? But we didn't test T at position3? So we don't know.

Therefore, possible words: batty, fatty, patty, tatty, matty.

Now, in all these, position1 is: B, F, P, T, M? Respectively? And position3 is T? Except maybe? All have T at position3? In ""batty"": position1:B, position3:T? Then position4:T? So two T's? Similarly others.

Are there words without T at position3?

For example: ""gaudy"": G,A,U,D,Y -> U and D absent? Invalid.

""hardy"": H,A,R,D,Y -> R and D absent? Invalid.

""parky"": P,A,R,K,Y -> R absent? Invalid.

""barky"": B,A,R,K,Y -> R absent? Invalid.

""mangy"": M,A,N,G,Y -> N absent? Invalid.

So it seems that with the pattern ?A?TY and the absent letters, the only possibilities are words with ?ATTY? Meaning, position3 is T? Because if not, we cannot form a word? So pattern: ?A T T Y? But position4 is T? So the word is position1: ?, position2: A, position3: ?, position4: T, position5: Y? And we have that position3 must be a letter? If not T? But we couldn't find any without T? So likely, position3 is also T? Or in some words, but none common? So I'll assume that.

Therefore, the word has pattern: ?A T T Y? With position4:T? And position3:T? So the word is ?ATTY.

Then position1: can be one of: B, F, M, P? Since they form valid words: batty, fatty, matty, patty? Tatty also? But tatty has two T's? Position1:T.

But tatty: T,A,T,T,Y -> so it has T at position1? So pattern: T A T T Y? Which matches.

Now, the possible words: batty, fatty, patty, matty, tatty.

Now, we need to guess which one? Since we have 3 guesses left? We don't know? But we can try one? Or guess a word that differentiates? But with one letter to differentiate? Position1 is the only unknown? So we can guess one? If we are wrong? We can try another? But we can only be wrong a few times? We have 6 total guesses? We used 3? So three left? It should be okay? But we can also guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? However, since position3 is T? And we haven't tested it? But from the pattern, we are inferring it? But we are not entirely sure.

Wait: we are making an assumption that position3 must be T? Because we cannot find other words? But there might be rare words? But in Wordle, words are common? So probably the options are batty, fatty, matty, patty, tatty.

But to confirm, are there words with position3 different from T? For example, ""happy"": but Y at end? But position4? We need T at position4? ""happy"" has P at4? Not T? So wrong.

""day"": not 5 letters.

So I think it's safe to assume that position3 is T? And position1 must be one of B,F,M,P,T? But T is already used? But we can have position1:T? In tatty.

Now, the available letters for position1 must be from: B,F,M,P,T? But we don't know if these are absent or not? But we haven't tested them? So they are possible.

But in our available letters? We have: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

But for position1, in the word, it can be: B,F,M,P,T? But T? We didn't list T? Because T was tested at position4? But T is present? So we can have duplicate T? Yes? So T is allowed.

Similarly, we must consider if other letters? But from word list? Probably only these.

Possible words: 
- batty: B
- fatty: F
- matty: M
- patty: P
- tatty: T

Now, we must choose one? But we haven't tested B,F,M,P,T? So we could guess one? But perhaps we can guess a word that covers more? But since we know the pattern, we can guess one directly.

We want to choose the most common? ""party"" is excluded? So ""patty"" is common? Or ""fatty"".

But note: in the feedback, we haven't tested B,F,M,P? So we don't know? But we can guess ""batty"" or something? And based on feedback? If wrong, we guess another? But we have guesses left? Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't use T at position1? Or something? But we have to try.

But actually, if we guess ""fatty"", for example? And it's wrong? Then we know it's one of the others? So we can only eliminate one? But it's okay.

However, we might be able to guess a word that doesn't assume position3 is T? But that might not be necessary? And we waste a guess? Actually, this is a good strategy: guess one? Because if correct, we win? Otherwise, next time.

So let's choose ""patty""? As it might be common? Or we can choose based on letter frequency.

Position1 can be B,F,M,P,T? So common ones: B,F,P? M and T less? But T is already present? So perhaps not? Actually, whichever.

To maximize, perhaps ""patty""? Or ""fatty"".

But note: in ""salty"", we tested S? Which was absent? Now, we haven't tested any of these? So we can't choose based?

Perhaps we can guess a word that has a different pattern? But we are confident that the word is ?A T T Y? Or ?A?TY with the only options being double T? So I recommend guessing ""fatty"".

But when we guess, if wrong? Then we know it's one of the others? And we can try next? But it's efficient? We have enough guesses.

So we'll guess ""fatty"".

But let's confirm:

Pattern: F A T T Y? But position3:T? Which we haven't confirmed? But when we guess ""fatty"", we get feedback: 
Position1: F? If absent? Then it must be other? Position2: A? Correct? Position3: T? We expect it to be? But if it is T? Then we get feedback? Etc.

So:

<thinking>
From ""salty"" feedback: S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(✓) Y(✓), we know:
- A is at position 2
- T is at position 4
- Y is at position 5
- S and L are absent
Combined with previous absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, S, L.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ A ? T Y

Since ? must be a letter that forms a valid English word and considering the constraints, common words matching ?A_ TY are ""batty,"" ""fatty,"" ""patty,"" ""matty,"" and ""tatty"" — all with ""T"" at position 3.

Possible words:
- Position 1: B (""batty""), F (""fatty""), M (""matty""), P (""patty""), T (""tatty"")
- Position 3: T (in all cases, as inferred)

To disambiguate, we guess ""fatty"" as it uses F (a common untested consonant) and tests position 1. If incorrect, we eliminate one candidate and proceed.

- **Possible letters for positions 1 and 3**: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Constraints for position 3**: Given the pattern and English language rules, valid words require position 3 to be T (forming `?A T T Y`). This is inferred because:  
  - No common English words match `?A_ TY` without T in position 3 and adhere to the absent letters (e.g., ""party"" is invalid due to R).  
  - Common words fitting `?A T T Y` include: *batty, fatty, matty, patty, tatty*.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Goal**: Test the most frequent position 1 candidate (F) while validating position 3 (T).  
- **Word choice**: ""fatty"" is optimal because:  
  - It tests F (a common untested consonant) at position 1.  
  - It assumes T at position 3 (consistent with word patterns).  
  - If correct, the word is solved. If incorrect, feedback eliminates F and the position 3 T hypothesis, narrowing to other candidates (batty, matty, patty, tatty).",Guess 4: fatty -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) A(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
