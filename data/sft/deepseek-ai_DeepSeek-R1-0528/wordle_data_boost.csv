We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are making our second guess after receiving feedback on the first.
 Previous guess: ""crane"" got feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Since none of these letters are in the word, we need to choose a new word that uses entirely different letters.

 We should avoid using C, R, A, N, E.

 We can consider other common vowels and consonants. The vowels left are O, U, I (and sometimes Y, but let's avoid for now).
 Common consonants left: S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, H, K, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""SPOIL"" or ""STOMP"" or ""LIGHT"", but we want a word with as much coverage as possible.

 Since we know the word has no C, R, A, N, E, let's pick a word that uses common letters not yet tried.

 How about ""SOUTH""? It has S, O, U, T, H. But note: We haven't tried these.

 However, to maximize new letter coverage, we might choose ""SPOIL"": S, P, O, I, L.

 But let's check: we have 6 tries and we've only eliminated 5 letters.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" is 5 letters? No, ""PIOUS"" is 5 letters: P-I-O-U-S. But that has two vowels and might not be ideal.

 Another very common word is ""SLUMP"" or ""BLOKE"". We want to cover as many high-frequency letters as possible.

 Looking at letter frequency in English words, after E, A, R, O, T (some of which we've eliminated), the next are: I, S, L, U, D, etc.

 Since we haven't tried: S, T, L, P, I, O, U, B, D, G, H, K, M, etc.

 We can choose a word that includes S, T, L, O? But note: O and U are vowels.

 Let me think of words: ""SOLID"" -> S, O, L, I, D -> covers S, O, L, I, D. But we have only tried C,R,A,N,E so S,O,L,I,D are new.

 ""SOLID"" seems good.

 However, we could also try ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T -> covers M, O, I, S, T.

 Both are valid 5-letter words.

 Another option: ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L -> but O and U are vowels and G and H are less common.

 Considering frequency: S and T are very common. So let's choose a word with S and T.

 Possibilities: ""STOMP"", ""SLOTH"", ""SPLIT"", ""MOIST"", etc.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it offers M, O, I, S, T.

 But note that we have no context yet, so covering five new common letters is key.

 Alternatively, since we know the word has none of C,R,A,N,E, we might also consider words with Y, but let's avoid for now.

 I'll go with ""MOIST"".

<guess>moist</guess>

But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? The feedback doesn't indicate that, but we'll rule it out if we see.

Alternatively, we could also consider ""PIOUS"" but I think ""MOIST"" is better.

We are on the third guess. Previous feedback:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → So the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.
- Guess 2: ""moist"" -> M(x), O(✓), I(x), S(✓), T(✓) → This tells us:
  - O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since O is the second letter in ""moist"" and it's marked correct).
  - S is in the word but in the wrong position (marked with ✓? Wait, the user's feedback for moist says: O(✓), I(x), S(✓), T(✓). Let me clarify the symbols.

Looking back at the rules:
  ✓ : correct letter and correct position.
  - : letter in word but wrong position.
  x : not in word.

In the feedback for ""moist"":
  M(x) → not in word.
  O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  I(x) → not in word.
  S(✓) → S is in the word and in the correct position? But wait, it says S(✓), meaning correct position? 
  T(✓) → T is in the word and in the correct position? 

But note: in ""moist"", the positions are:
  1: M
  2: O
  3: I
  4: S
  5: T

So the feedback says:
  M at position 1: x
  O at position 2: ✓ (correct)
  I at position 3: x
  S at position 4: ✓ → so S is correct at position 4?
  T at position 5: ✓ → so T is correct at position 5?

That would mean the secret word has:
  position 2: O
  position 4: S
  position 5: T

And the letters M and I are not in the word.

Also, from guess 1, we know that C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.

So now we know:
  The secret word must have O in the second position, S in the fourth, and T in the fifth.
  So the word is: _ O _ S T

And we know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

We need to fill the first and third positions.

We have to choose a word of the form: X O Y S T, where X and Y are letters that haven't been eliminated and form a valid English word.

Known eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

We can consider words that end with ""OST"" (since positions 4 and 5 are S and T, so the last three letters are ""O_ST"" but actually the word has:
  positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 → so 1: unknown, 2: O, 3: unknown, 4: S, 5: T → so pattern: ? O ? S T

Now, what words are of this form? The last two letters are ST. The second letter is O.

So possible words: 
  boost, hoist, joist, roast, toast, worst, ... but we have to check against eliminated letters.

But note:
  ""hoist"": H, O, I, S, T → but I is eliminated (from guess2: I(x)). So not possible.
  ""joist"": J, O, I, S, T → again I is eliminated.
  ""roast"": R, O, A, S, T → R and A are eliminated (from guess1).
  ""toast"": T, O, A, S, T → A is eliminated, and also T at the beginning. Wait, but T is in the word? Yes, but at position 5 is fixed T. Also, T might appear again? But feedback doesn't tell about duplicates. However, in ""toast"", we have T at position1 and position5. But we know T is at the end, so if T is at position1, it might be a duplicate? But we don't know.

However, in our case, from guess1, T hasn't been tried? No — in guess1 we tried: C,R,A,N,E — no T. Then guess2: we tried T and it was correct at position5. So T is in the word at position5. 

But could there be another T? We don't know. The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates explicitly. In ""toast"", if the secret word is ""toast"", then:
  For guess2 ""moist"": 
    M (x), O (✓), I (x), S (✓), T (✓) → for position1: M vs T? T isn't in the secret word at that position? But if the secret word is ""toast"", then:
      Position1: T vs M → T is in the word but not at position1? Then the T in ""moist"" at position5 is matching, so for position1: M (which is not T) should be compared? 
    Actually, the feedback for T was at position5: T vs T → correct. 
    For the letter T at position1 in ""toast"", we haven't tried it.

But for our current pattern: X O Y S T, and we know the word doesn't contain: C,R,A,N,E,M,I.

Let me list possible words that end with ""OST"" and have 'O' in the second position? Actually, all words of the pattern ? O ? S T.

Some English words:
  boost → B, O, O, S, T → but we have two O's? Pattern: B O O S T → but our pattern only has third letter? In ""boost"", positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:O, 4:S, 5:T → so third letter is O? Then the word would be ""boost"". But we are going for X O Y S T → with Y as O? Then it's ""boost"". Letters: B, O, O, S, T.

But eliminated letters: B hasn't been eliminated? We haven't tried B. We have tried: C,R,A,N,E,M,I. So B is still available.

Also, we can have:
  joust: J, O, U, S, T → U hasn't been tried? But U is allowed. Letters: J, U → not eliminated? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,M,I → J and U are okay.
  toast: T, O, A, S, T → eliminated: A (from guess1) → so not possible? But A is already ruled out? Yes, A is eliminated.
  worst: W, O, R, S, T → R eliminated? Yes, from guess1 → R is eliminated.

Also:
  ghost: G, H, O, S, T → pattern: G O _ S T → but the word is ""ghost""? Positions: 1:G, 2:O, 3:H, 4:S, 5:T → so Y is H → so the word is ""ghost"". 

Now, the third letter in our pattern is position3 → which in ""ghost"" is H.

So possible words: 
  boost → B O O S T → but we have double O? But that's okay, because we haven't ruled out O? We know O is in the word at second position. But we haven't tried O elsewhere? However, in feedback for guess2, we had only one O? But the secret word might have two O's? We don't know.

But also, we haven't tested B, G, H, J, U, etc.

So candidates: 
  boost, ghost, joust, etc.

But let's check letters:
  boost: B, O, O, S, T → eliminated letters: none of these are in C,R,A,N,E,M,I? B is new, O is present (but we know), S and T are present → valid.
  ghost: G, H, O, S, T → G and H are new → valid.
  joust: J, O, U, S, T → J, U → new → valid.

But we need to use a valid English word.

We have to pick one. Let's think about what letters we want to test.

We have positions 1 and 3 to determine. We want to use a word that tests common letters for positions 1 and 3.

Moreover, we know that we must avoid the eliminated letters: [C, R, A, N, E, M, I].

We might also consider ""hosts"" → but that ends with S? No, we need exactly positions 4 and 5 as S and T → so word must be ...S T.

""boost"" might be good because it has B (which is common) and tests the third letter as O. But if we try ""boost"", and if the word is ""ghost"", then we would get:

But wait, we only have 4 tries left? Actually, we are on guess 3.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that has as many new letters as possible to test.

Let me think: the word must be of the form _ O _ S T.

We can guess words that fit the known pattern and introduce new common letters.

Consider ""ghost"" → could we guess that? But we don't know G and H.

Similarly, we might guess ""joust"" for J and U.

But how about ""foust""? Not a word.

Another possibility: ""boust"" is not a word.

We should stick to valid words.

Another word: ""dowst"" — not a word.

What about ""goust"" — not standard.

So common ones: boost, ghost, joust.

Let's list more? I think ""boost"", ""ghost"", ""joust"", ""doublest""? No, 5 letters.

Another: ""joist"" but we have I? I is eliminated → so not possible.

So currently: boost, ghost, joust.

We need to maximize information if wrong. We want letters that can appear in other positions? But positions 1 and 3 are unknown.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't necessarily fit the pattern? But we already know three letters: O at 2, S at 4, T at 5. So guessing a word that doesn't have O at 2 might not be efficient? Because then we wouldn't get feedback on the correct pattern.

So sticking to the pattern seems best.

Now, which one to choose? We have to test letters. We haven't tried many letters.

Eliminated so far: C,R,A,N,E,M,I → 7 letters.

Available: many others. Common letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, O (already known), P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But O, S, T are known to be in the word? S and T are confirmed? And we know their positions.

Actually, the secret word has O, S, T at positions 2,4,5. But what about positions 1 and 3? They could be duplicates? But no duplicates suggested.

Now, let's think: the first guess eliminated 5 letters, the second eliminated M and I and confirmed O, S, T. So we have many letters left.

We could choose ""ghost"" because it introduces G and H, which are common consonants. Similarly, ""joust"" introduces J and U. U is a vowel? We haven't tried vowels? We tried A, E, I, O. We know O is present, A, E, I are absent. So vowels left: U, and sometimes Y.

So we might want to test U? Or not?

Alternatively, we might avoid using U? Because if the word doesn't have U, we get information.

But we don't know.

I think we should pick a word that uses common letters that haven't been tested as much. But we don't have any other constraints.

Moreover, we are not at the end game, so testing new letters is good.

So let's pick ""ghost"". Why? Because G and H are common. Also, ""ghost"" is a common word.

But what if the word is ""boost""? Then we'll leave B untested? But we can check next.

Alternatively, we might use ""boust"" — no, not a word.

Another thought: we could choose ""burst"" → but R is eliminated? Yes.

Let me decide: we'll guess ""ghost"". If we get:
  G: if correct at position1? Or not?
  O: already known ✓
  H: at position3? If correct or not?
  S: known ✓
  T: known ✓

But we'll see the feedback for G and H.

Similarly, if we choose ""boost"", then B and O (at position3) would be tested.

But note: in ""ghost"", the third letter is H → if H is in the word at position3? Or wrong position? Or not at all? We'll find out.

Same for any choice.

I think ""ghost"" is a good guess because we test two new letters: G and H.

So let's go with ""ghost"".

But wait, the pattern: positions must be: 1:G, 2:O (correct), 3:H, 4:S (correct), 5:T (correct). So the word ""ghost"" fits the pattern.

Similarly, ""joust"": J, O, U, S, T → 1:J, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T.

So I'll choose ""ghost"".

<guess>ghost</guess>

But note: we haven't tried the letter H anywhere? So we are testing H at position3.

If the word is ""ghost"", we win. If not, we get feedback on G and H.

If the feedback says G(x) and H(x), then we know position1 and position3 are not G and H. Then we can try another? So it's efficient.

Similarly, if G is correct but H is not, then we know position1 is G, and position3 must be something else.

So let's do that.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:  
- Guess 1 (""crane"") eliminated C, R, A, N, and E (no letters match).  
- Guess 2 (""moist"") showed:  
  - ✓ for O (position 2): confirmed O is correct and in position 2.  
  - x for I: I is not in the word.  
  - ✓ for S (position 4): S is correct and in position 5.  
  - ✓ for T (position 5): T is correct and in position 5.  
  - x for M: M is not in the word.  

This reveals the secret word has the pattern: \_ O \_ S T.  
- Known positions:  
  - Position 2: O  
  - Position 4: S  
  - Position 5: T  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.  

Possible words fitting \_ O \_ S T include ""ghost,"" ""boost,"" and ""joust.""  
- Choosing ""ghost"" tests new common letters (G and H) in positions 1 and 3.  
- If incorrect, feedback will provide info on G/H, guiding the next guess.  

<guess>ghost</guess>",ghost,"We are on the third guess. Previous feedback:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → So the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.
- Guess 2: ""moist"" -> M(x), O(✓), I(x), S(✓), T(✓) → This tells us:
  - O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since O is the second letter in ""moist"" and it's marked correct).
  - S is in the word but in the wrong position (marked with ✓? Wait, the user's feedback for moist says: O(✓), I(x), S(✓), T(✓). Let me clarify the symbols.

Looking back at the rules:
  ✓ : correct letter and correct position.
  - : letter in word but wrong position.
  x : not in word.

In the feedback for ""moist"":
  M(x) → not in word.
  O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  I(x) → not in word.
  S(✓) → S is in the word and in the correct position? But wait, it says S(✓), meaning correct position? 
  T(✓) → T is in the word and in the correct position? 

But note: in ""moist"", the positions are:
  1: M
  2: O
  3: I
  4: S
  5: T

So the feedback says:
  M at position 1: x
  O at position 2: ✓ (correct)
  I at position 3: x
  S at position 4: ✓ → so S is correct at position 4?
  T at position 5: ✓ → so T is correct at position 5?

That would mean the secret word has:
  position 2: O
  position 4: S
  position 5: T

And the letters M and I are not in the word.

Also, from guess 1, we know that C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.

So now we know:
  The secret word must have O in the second position, S in the fourth, and T in the fifth.
  So the word is: _ O _ S T

And we know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

We need to fill the first and third positions.

We have to choose a word of the form: X O Y S T, where X and Y are letters that haven't been eliminated and form a valid English word.

Known eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

We can consider words that end with ""OST"" (since positions 4 and 5 are S and T, so the last three letters are ""O_ST"" but actually the word has:
  positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 → so 1: unknown, 2: O, 3: unknown, 4: S, 5: T → so pattern: ? O ? S T

Now, what words are of this form? The last two letters are ST. The second letter is O.

So possible words: 
  boost, hoist, joist, roast, toast, worst, ... but we have to check against eliminated letters.

But note:
  ""hoist"": H, O, I, S, T → but I is eliminated (from guess2: I(x)). So not possible.
  ""joist"": J, O, I, S, T → again I is eliminated.
  ""roast"": R, O, A, S, T → R and A are eliminated (from guess1).
  ""toast"": T, O, A, S, T → A is eliminated, and also T at the beginning. Wait, but T is in the word? Yes, but at position 5 is fixed T. Also, T might appear again? But feedback doesn't tell about duplicates. However, in ""toast"", we have T at position1 and position5. But we know T is at the end, so if T is at position1, it might be a duplicate? But we don't know.

However, in our case, from guess1, T hasn't been tried? No — in guess1 we tried: C,R,A,N,E — no T. Then guess2: we tried T and it was correct at position5. So T is in the word at position5. 

But could there be another T? We don't know. The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates explicitly. In ""toast"", if the secret word is ""toast"", then:
  For guess2 ""moist"": 
    M (x), O (✓), I (x), S (✓), T (✓) → for position1: M vs T? T isn't in the secret word at that position? But if the secret word is ""toast"", then:
      Position1: T vs M → T is in the word but not at position1? Then the T in ""moist"" at position5 is matching, so for position1: M (which is not T) should be compared? 
    Actually, the feedback for T was at position5: T vs T → correct. 
    For the letter T at position1 in ""toast"", we haven't tried it.

But for our current pattern: X O Y S T, and we know the word doesn't contain: C,R,A,N,E,M,I.

Let me list possible words that end with ""OST"" and have 'O' in the second position? Actually, all words of the pattern ? O ? S T.

Some English words:
  boost → B, O, O, S, T → but we have two O's? Pattern: B O O S T → but our pattern only has third letter? In ""boost"", positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:O, 4:S, 5:T → so third letter is O? Then the word would be ""boost"". But we are going for X O Y S T → with Y as O? Then it's ""boost"". Letters: B, O, O, S, T.

But eliminated letters: B hasn't been eliminated? We haven't tried B. We have tried: C,R,A,N,E,M,I. So B is still available.

Also, we can have:
  joust: J, O, U, S, T → U hasn't been tried? But U is allowed. Letters: J, U → not eliminated? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,M,I → J and U are okay.
  toast: T, O, A, S, T → eliminated: A (from guess1) → so not possible? But A is already ruled out? Yes, A is eliminated.
  worst: W, O, R, S, T → R eliminated? Yes, from guess1 → R is eliminated.

Also:
  ghost: G, H, O, S, T → pattern: G O _ S T → but the word is ""ghost""? Positions: 1:G, 2:O, 3:H, 4:S, 5:T → so Y is H → so the word is ""ghost"". 

Now, the third letter in our pattern is position3 → which in ""ghost"" is H.

So possible words: 
  boost → B O O S T → but we have double O? But that's okay, because we haven't ruled out O? We know O is in the word at second position. But we haven't tried O elsewhere? However, in feedback for guess2, we had only one O? But the secret word might have two O's? We don't know.

But also, we haven't tested B, G, H, J, U, etc.

So candidates: 
  boost, ghost, joust, etc.

But let's check letters:
  boost: B, O, O, S, T → eliminated letters: none of these are in C,R,A,N,E,M,I? B is new, O is present (but we know), S and T are present → valid.
  ghost: G, H, O, S, T → G and H are new → valid.
  joust: J, O, U, S, T → J, U → new → valid.

But we need to use a valid English word.

We have to pick one. Let's think about what letters we want to test.

We have positions 1 and 3 to determine. We want to use a word that tests common letters for positions 1 and 3.

Moreover, we know that we must avoid the eliminated letters: [C, R, A, N, E, M, I].

We might also consider ""hosts"" → but that ends with S? No, we need exactly positions 4 and 5 as S and T → so word must be ...S T.

""boost"" might be good because it has B (which is common) and tests the third letter as O. But if we try ""boost"", and if the word is ""ghost"", then we would get:

But wait, we only have 4 tries left? Actually, we are on guess 3.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that has as many new letters as possible to test.

Let me think: the word must be of the form _ O _ S T.

We can guess words that fit the known pattern and introduce new common letters.

Consider ""ghost"" → could we guess that? But we don't know G and H.

Similarly, we might guess ""joust"" for J and U.

But how about ""foust""? Not a word.

Another possibility: ""boust"" is not a word.

We should stick to valid words.

Another word: ""dowst"" — not a word.

What about ""goust"" — not standard.

So common ones: boost, ghost, joust.

Let's list more? I think ""boost"", ""ghost"", ""joust"", ""doublest""? No, 5 letters.

Another: ""joist"" but we have I? I is eliminated → so not possible.

So currently: boost, ghost, joust.

We need to maximize information if wrong. We want letters that can appear in other positions? But positions 1 and 3 are unknown.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't necessarily fit the pattern? But we already know three letters: O at 2, S at 4, T at 5. So guessing a word that doesn't have O at 2 might not be efficient? Because then we wouldn't get feedback on the correct pattern.

So sticking to the pattern seems best.

Now, which one to choose? We have to test letters. We haven't tried many letters.

Actually, the secret word has O, S, T at positions 2,4,5. But what about positions 1 and 3? They could be duplicates? But no duplicates suggested.

Similarly, ""joust"": J, O, U, S, T → 1:J, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T.

So I'll choose ""ghost"".

<guess>ghost</guess>

But note: we haven't tried the letter H anywhere? So we are testing H at position3.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are making our second guess after receiving feedback on the first.
 Previous guess: ""crane"" got feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Since none of these letters are in the word, we need to choose a new word that uses entirely different letters.

 We should avoid using C, R, A, N, E.

 We can consider other common vowels and consonants. The vowels left are O, U, I (and sometimes Y, but let's avoid for now).
 Common consonants left: S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, H, K, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""SPOIL"" or ""STOMP"" or ""LIGHT"", but we want a word with as much coverage as possible.

 Since we know the word has no C, R, A, N, E, let's pick a word that uses common letters not yet tried.

 How about ""SOUTH""? It has S, O, U, T, H. But note: We haven't tried these.

 However, to maximize new letter coverage, we might choose ""SPOIL"": S, P, O, I, L.

 But let's check: we have 6 tries and we've only eliminated 5 letters.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" is 5 letters? No, ""PIOUS"" is 5 letters: P-I-O-U-S. But that has two vowels and might not be ideal.

 Another very common word is ""SLUMP"" or ""BLOKE"". We want to cover as many high-frequency letters as possible.

 Looking at letter frequency in English words, after E, A, R, O, T (some of which we've eliminated), the next are: I, S, L, U, D, etc.

 Since we haven't tried: S, T, L, P, I, O, U, B, D, G, H, K, M, etc.

 We can choose a word that includes S, T, L, O? But note: O and U are vowels.

 Let me think of words: ""SOLID"" -> S, O, L, I, D -> covers S, O, L, I, D. But we have only tried C,R,A,N,E so S,O,L,I,D are new.

 ""SOLID"" seems good.

 However, we could also try ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T -> covers M, O, I, S, T.

 Both are valid 5-letter words.

 Another option: ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L -> but O and U are vowels and G and H are less common.

 Considering frequency: S and T are very common. So let's choose a word with S and T.

 Possibilities: ""STOMP"", ""SLOTH"", ""SPLIT"", ""MOIST"", etc.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it offers M, O, I, S, T.

 But note that we have no context yet, so covering five new common letters is key.

 Alternatively, since we know the word has none of C,R,A,N,E, we might also consider words with Y, but let's avoid for now.

 I'll go with ""MOIST"".

<guess>moist</guess>

But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? The feedback doesn't indicate that, but we'll rule it out if we see.

Alternatively, we could also consider ""PIOUS"" but I think ""MOIST"" is better.

In the feedback for ""moist"":
  M(x) → not in word.
  O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  I(x) → not in word.
  S(✓) → S is in the word and in the correct position? But wait, it says S(✓), meaning correct position? 
  T(✓) → T is in the word and in the correct position? 

But note: in ""moist"", the positions are:
  1: M
  2: O
  3: I
  4: S
  5: T

So the feedback says:
  M at position 1: x
  O at position 2: ✓ (correct)
  I at position 3: x
  S at position 4: ✓ → so S is correct at position 4?
  T at position 5: ✓ → so T is correct at position 5?

That would mean the secret word has:
  position 2: O
  position 4: S
  position 5: T

And the letters M and I are not in the word.

Also, from guess 1, we know that C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.

So now we know:
  The secret word must have O in the second position, S in the fourth, and T in the fifth.
  So the word is: _ O _ S T

And we know that the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

We need to fill the first and third positions.

We have to choose a word of the form: X O Y S T, where X and Y are letters that haven't been eliminated and form a valid English word.

Known eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

We can consider words that end with ""OST"" (since positions 4 and 5 are S and T, so the last three letters are ""O_ST"" but actually the word has:
  positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 → so 1: unknown, 2: O, 3: unknown, 4: S, 5: T → so pattern: ? O ? S T

Now, what words are of this form? The last two letters are ST. The second letter is O.

So possible words: 
  boost, hoist, joist, roast, toast, worst, ... but we have to check against eliminated letters.

But note:
  ""hoist"": H, O, I, S, T → but I is eliminated (from guess2: I(x)). So not possible.
  ""joist"": J, O, I, S, T → again I is eliminated.
  ""roast"": R, O, A, S, T → R and A are eliminated (from guess1).
  ""toast"": T, O, A, S, T → A is eliminated, and also T at the beginning. Wait, but T is in the word? Yes, but at position 5 is fixed T. Also, T might appear again? But feedback doesn't tell about duplicates. However, in ""toast"", we have T at position1 and position5. But we know T is at the end, so if T is at position1, it might be a duplicate? But we don't know.

However, in our case, from guess1, T hasn't been tried? No — in guess1 we tried: C,R,A,N,E — no T. Then guess2: we tried T and it was correct at position5. So T is in the word at position5. 

But could there be another T? We don't know. The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates explicitly. In ""toast"", if the secret word is ""toast"", then:
  For guess2 ""moist"": 
    M (x), O (✓), I (x), S (✓), T (✓) → for position1: M vs T? T isn't in the secret word at that position? But if the secret word is ""toast"", then:
      Position1: T vs M → T is in the word but not at position1? Then the T in ""moist"" at position5 is matching, so for position1: M (which is not T) should be compared? 
    Actually, the feedback for T was at position5: T vs T → correct. 
    For the letter T at position1 in ""toast"", we haven't tried it.

But for our current pattern: X O Y S T, and we know the word doesn't contain: C,R,A,N,E,M,I.

Let me list possible words that end with ""OST"" and have 'O' in the second position? Actually, all words of the pattern ? O ? S T.

Some English words:
  boost → B, O, O, S, T → but we have two O's? Pattern: B O O S T → but our pattern only has third letter? In ""boost"", positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:O, 4:S, 5:T → so third letter is O? Then the word would be ""boost"". But we are going for X O Y S T → with Y as O? Then it's ""boost"". Letters: B, O, O, S, T.

But eliminated letters: B hasn't been eliminated? We haven't tried B. We have tried: C,R,A,N,E,M,I. So B is still available.

Also, we can have:
  joust: J, O, U, S, T → U hasn't been tried? But U is allowed. Letters: J, U → not eliminated? Eliminated: C,R,A,N,E,M,I → J and U are okay.
  toast: T, O, A, S, T → eliminated: A (from guess1) → so not possible? But A is already ruled out? Yes, A is eliminated.
  worst: W, O, R, S, T → R eliminated? Yes, from guess1 → R is eliminated.

Also:
  ghost: G, H, O, S, T → pattern: G O _ S T → but the word is ""ghost""? Positions: 1:G, 2:O, 3:H, 4:S, 5:T → so Y is H → so the word is ""ghost"". 

Now, the third letter in our pattern is position3 → which in ""ghost"" is H.

So possible words: 
  boost → B O O S T → but we have double O? But that's okay, because we haven't ruled out O? We know O is in the word at second position. But we haven't tried O elsewhere? However, in feedback for guess2, we had only one O? But the secret word might have two O's? We don't know.

But also, we haven't tested B, G, H, J, U, etc.

So candidates: 
  boost, ghost, joust, etc.

But let's check letters:
  boost: B, O, O, S, T → eliminated letters: none of these are in C,R,A,N,E,M,I? B is new, O is present (but we know), S and T are present → valid.
  ghost: G, H, O, S, T → G and H are new → valid.
  joust: J, O, U, S, T → J, U → new → valid.

But we need to use a valid English word.

We have to pick one. Let's think about what letters we want to test.

We have positions 1 and 3 to determine. We want to use a word that tests common letters for positions 1 and 3.

Moreover, we know that we must avoid the eliminated letters: [C, R, A, N, E, M, I].

We might also consider ""hosts"" → but that ends with S? No, we need exactly positions 4 and 5 as S and T → so word must be ...S T.

""boost"" might be good because it has B (which is common) and tests the third letter as O. But if we try ""boost"", and if the word is ""ghost"", then we would get:

But wait, we only have 4 tries left? Actually, we are on guess 3.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that has as many new letters as possible to test.

Let me think: the word must be of the form _ O _ S T.

We can guess words that fit the known pattern and introduce new common letters.

Consider ""ghost"" → could we guess that? But we don't know G and H.

Similarly, we might guess ""joust"" for J and U.

But how about ""foust""? Not a word.

Another possibility: ""boust"" is not a word.

We should stick to valid words.

Another word: ""dowst"" — not a word.

What about ""goust"" — not standard.

So common ones: boost, ghost, joust.

Let's list more? I think ""boost"", ""ghost"", ""joust"", ""doublest""? No, 5 letters.

Another: ""joist"" but we have I? I is eliminated → so not possible.

So currently: boost, ghost, joust.

We need to maximize information if wrong. We want letters that can appear in other positions? But positions 1 and 3 are unknown.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't necessarily fit the pattern? But we already know three letters: O at 2, S at 4, T at 5. So guessing a word that doesn't have O at 2 might not be efficient? Because then we wouldn't get feedback on the correct pattern.

So sticking to the pattern seems best.

Now, which one to choose? We have to test letters. We haven't tried many letters.

Eliminated so far: C,R,A,N,E,M,I → 7 letters.

Available: many others. Common letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, O (already known), P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But O, S, T are known to be in the word? S and T are confirmed? And we know their positions.

Actually, the secret word has O, S, T at positions 2,4,5. But what about positions 1 and 3? They could be duplicates? But no duplicates suggested.

Now, let's think: the first guess eliminated 5 letters, the second eliminated M and I and confirmed O, S, T. So we have many letters left.

We could choose ""ghost"" because it introduces G and H, which are common consonants. Similarly, ""joust"" introduces J and U. U is a vowel? We haven't tried vowels? We tried A, E, I, O. We know O is present, A, E, I are absent. So vowels left: U, and sometimes Y.

So we might want to test U? Or not?

Alternatively, we might avoid using U? Because if the word doesn't have U, we get information.

But we don't know.

I think we should pick a word that uses common letters that haven't been tested as much. But we don't have any other constraints.

Moreover, we are not at the end game, so testing new letters is good.

So let's pick ""ghost"". Why? Because G and H are common. Also, ""ghost"" is a common word.

But what if the word is ""boost""? Then we'll leave B untested? But we can check next.

Alternatively, we might use ""boust"" — no, not a word.

Another thought: we could choose ""burst"" → but R is eliminated? Yes.

Let me decide: we'll guess ""ghost"". If we get:
  G: if correct at position1? Or not?
  O: already known ✓
  H: at position3? If correct or not?
  S: known ✓
  T: known ✓

But we'll see the feedback for G and H.

Similarly, if we choose ""boost"", then B and O (at position3) would be tested.

But note: in ""ghost"", the third letter is H → if H is in the word at position3? Or wrong position? Or not at all? We'll find out.

Same for any choice.

I think ""ghost"" is a good guess because we test two new letters: G and H.

So let's go with ""ghost"".

But wait, the pattern: positions must be: 1:G, 2:O (correct), 3:H, 4:S (correct), 5:T (correct). So the word ""ghost"" fits the pattern.

Similarly, ""joust"": J, O, U, S, T → 1:J, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T.

So I'll choose ""ghost"".

<guess>ghost</guess>

But note: we haven't tried the letter H anywhere? So we are testing H at position3.

If the word is ""ghost"", we win. If not, we get feedback on G and H.

If the feedback says G(x) and H(x), then we know position1 and position3 are not G and H. Then we can try another? So it's efficient.

Similarly, if G is correct but H is not, then we know position1 is G, and position3 must be something else.

So let's do that.Based on the previous feedback:  
- Guess 1 (""crane"") eliminated C, R, A, N, and E (no letters match).  
- Guess 2 (""moist"") showed:  
  - ✓ for O (position 2): confirmed O is correct and in position 2.  
  - x for I: I is not in the word.  
  - ✓ for S (position 4): S is correct and in position 5.  
  - ✓ for T (position 5): T is correct and in position 5.  
  - x for M: M is not in the word.  

This reveals the secret word has the pattern: \_ O \_ S T.  
- Known positions:  
  - Position 2: O  
  - Position 4: S  
  - Position 5: T  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.  

Possible words fitting \_ O \_ S T include ""ghost,"" ""boost,"" and ""joust.""  
- Choosing ""ghost"" tests new common letters (G and H) in positions 1 and 3.  
- If incorrect, feedback will provide info on G/H, guiding the next guess.

We haven\'t tried many letters.\n\nEliminated so far: C,R,A,N,E,M,I → 7 letters.\n\nAvailable: many others. Common letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, O (already known), P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut O, S, T are known to be in the word? S and T are confirmed? And we know their positions.\n\nActually, the secret word has O, S, T at positions 2,4,5. But what about positions 1 and 3? They could be duplicates? But no duplicates suggested.\n\nNow, let\'s think: the first guess eliminated 5 letters, the second eliminated M and I and confirmed O, S, T. So we have many letters left.\n\nWe could choose ""ghost"" because it introduces G and H, which are common consonants. Similarly, ""joust"" introduces J and U. U is a vowel? We haven\'t tried vowels? We tried A, E, I, O. We know O is present, A, E, I are absent. So vowels left: U, and sometimes Y.\n\nSo we might want to test U? Or not?\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid using U? Because if the word doesn\'t have U, we get information.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nI think we should pick a word that uses common letters that haven\'t been tested as much. But we don\'t have any other constraints.\n\nMoreover, we are not at the end game, so testing new letters is good.\n\nSo let\'s pick ""ghost"". Why? Because G and H are common. Also, ""ghost"" is a common word.\n\nBut what if the word is ""boost""? Then we\'ll leave B untested? But we can check next.\n\nAlternatively, we might use ""boust"" — no, not a word.\n\nAnother thought: we could choose ""burst"" → but R is eliminated? Yes.\n\nLet me decide: we\'ll guess ""ghost"". If we get:\n  G: if correct at position1? Or not?\n  O: already known ✓\n  H: at position3? If correct or not?\n  S: known ✓\n  T: known ✓\n\nBut we\'ll see the feedback for G and H.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose ""boost"", then B and O (at position3) would be tested.\n\nBut note: in ""ghost"", the third letter is H → if H is in the word at position3? Or wrong position? Or not at all? We\'ll find out.\n\nSame for any choice.\n\nI think ""ghost"" is a good guess because we test two new letters: G and H.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""ghost"".\n\nBut wait, the pattern: positions must be: 1:G, 2:O (correct), 3:H, 4:S (correct), 5:T (correct). So the word ""ghost"" fits the pattern.\n\nSimilarly, ""joust"": J, O, U, S, T → 1:J, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T.\n\nSo I\'ll choose ""ghost"".\n\n<guess>ghost</guess>\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tried the letter H anywhere? So we are testing H at position3.\n\nIf the word is ""ghost"", we win. If not, we get feedback on G and H.\n\nIf the feedback says G(x) and H(x), then we know position1 and position3 are not G and H. Then we can try another? So it\'s efficient.\n\nSimilarly, if G is correct but H is not, then we know position1 is G, and position3 must be something else.\n\nSo let\'s do that.Based on the previous feedback:  \n- Guess 1 (""crane"") eliminated C, R, A, N, and E (no letters match).  \n- Guess 2 (""moist"") showed:  \n  - ✓ for O (position 2): confirmed O is correct and in position 2.  \n  - x for I: I is not in the word.  \n  - ✓ for S (position 4): S is correct and in position 5.  \n  - ✓ for T (position 5): T is correct and in position 5.  \n  - x for M: M is not in the word.  \n\nThis reveals the secret word has the pattern: \\_ O \\_ S T.  \n- Known positions:  \n  - Position 2: O  \n  - Position 4: S  \n  - Position 5: T  \n- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.  \n\nPossible words fitting \\_ O \\_ S T include ""ghost,"" ""boost,"" and ""joust.""  \n- Choosing ""ghost"" tests new common letters (G and H) in positions 1 and 3.  \n- If incorrect, feedback will provide info on G/H, guiding the next guess.\n\n<guess>ghost</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(✓)\nGuess 3: ghost -> FEEDBACK: G(x) H(x) O(✓) S(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are on the fourth guess. Previous feedback:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" → C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- Guess 2: ""moist"" → M and I are not in the word. O is correct at position 2, S is correct at position 4, T is correct at position 5.
- Guess 3: ""ghost"" → G and H are not in the word. O, S, T are correct (positions 2,4,5 as before).

So the secret word pattern is: _ O _ S T

Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G, H.

We need to find a word that fits the pattern and uses only letters not eliminated.

Available letters: We have not tried: B, D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But the word must be a valid English word of the form ? O ? S T.

Possible words:
- boost: B O O S T → but we have two O's? The pattern requires the second letter O and the fourth S and fifth T. The third letter would be O? So ""boost"" has B at position 1 and O at position 3? But position 3 is the third letter, which in ""boost"" is O. So it fits: B O O S T. But we don't know if the word has two O's? It's possible. And B is available.
- joust: J O U S T → J at 1, U at 3. U is available.
- foist: but F is available, but I is eliminated → I is not allowed.
- moist: already tried and had I which is eliminated.
- toast: T at 1 and A at 3? But A is eliminated → not possible.
- worst: W at 1, R at 3 → R eliminated → not possible.
- boost and joust are the main ones.

But are there others?
- dowst: not a word.
- foust: not a word.
- jowst: not a word.
- lowst: not a word.
- powst: not a word.
- rowst: not a word, and R eliminated.
- vowst: not a word.
- wowst: not a word.
- yowst: not a word.

What about ""boast""? But A is eliminated.

""boosts"" is 6 letters.

Another: ""brosy"" no, pattern doesn't match.

So common words: boost, joust.

Also, ""joist"" but I eliminated.

""frost"" but R and F? F is available, but R is eliminated? ""frost"": F R O S T → R is eliminated → not possible.

""ghost"" we tried.

So we have two strong candidates: ""boost"" and ""joust"".

We need to choose one. We can also consider if there are words with other letters.

What about ""dowst""? Not a word.

""howst"" not a word.

""joust"" and ""boost"" are the only common ones.

We can also consider ""yourt"" or something? Not a word.

So let's choose between ""boost"" and ""joust"".

We want to test new letters. ""boost"" has B and O (O is already known, so we are testing B and the possibility of double O? But we don't know if O is duplicated).

""joust"" has J and U, which are less common? But U is a vowel we haven't tested.

We might prefer to test more common letters? But B is more common than J and U.

Letter frequency: B is more common than J and U.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can also think: if we guess ""boost"", and it's wrong, we get feedback on B and the third letter O? But if the third letter is O, then it's ""boost"". If not, then we know the third letter is not O, and B is not in the word? Or if B is in the word but not at position1? But the pattern only has position1 and position3 unknown.

If we guess ""boost"":
- Position1: B → if B is in the word? If not, then x. If in the word but wrong position? But the only unknown positions are 1 and 3, so if B is in the word, it must be at position1 or position3? But position3 is O in this guess? So if B is not at position1, and the word has B, then it must be at position3? But position3 is O in ""boost"", so if the word has B, it can only be at position1? Because position3 is taken by O in this guess? 

Actually, in ""boost"", we are setting position1 to B and position3 to O.

So if the secret word is ""joust"", then:
- Position1: B vs J → B is not in the word? Then x.
- Position3: O vs U → O is in the word but at position2? So if the secret word has only one O (at position2), then O at position3 would be wrong? But we know O is at position2, so if the secret word has only one O, then O at position3 is not present? So it would be x? But wait, the feedback for O: we have O at position2 which is correct, and O at position3? If the word has only one O, then the O at position3 would be marked as not in the word? Or as wrong position? 

The rules: if the letter is in the word but in a different position, it gets a dash (-). If it's not in the word at all, it gets x.

But if the secret word has only one O (at position2), then an O at position3 would be:
  - The letter O is in the word, but not at position3 → so it should be marked as - (wrong position) if the secret word has another O? But the secret word has only one O? Then the O at position3 is not in the word? Because the O is already used at position2? 

In Wordle, if there is only one O in the secret word, and you guess two O's, then the first one that matches (if any) gets the correct, and the second one might be marked as not present? Or if one is correct, the other might be marked as absent if there's no duplicate.

Standard Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret word has one O, and you guess two O's, one in the correct position and one not, then the correct one gets ✓ and the other gets x (because there's no second O to match).

So in ""boost"" for a secret word with only one O (like ""joust"" which has one O at position2):
  - Position2: O → ✓ (correct)
  - Position3: O → x (because no second O in the word)

Similarly, for position1: B → if not in the word, x.

So if we guess ""boost"" and the word is ""joust"", we get: B(x), O(✓), O(x), S(✓), T(✓) → so we know that the third letter is not O and B is not in the word.

Then we can try ""joust"" next.

But if we guess ""joust"" first, and the word is ""boost"", then:
  - Position1: J vs B → J not in word? x
  - Position2: O ✓
  - Position3: U vs O → U not in word? x (if no U) and O is in the word but at position2? So U is not in the word → x
  - Position4: S ✓
  - Position5: T ✓
  So feedback: J(x), O(✓), U(x), S(✓), T(✓) → then we know the word has no J, U, and the third letter is not U. Then we can try ""boost"".

So either way, we might need two guesses? But we have three guesses left? We are on guess 4, so we have 3 more? No, we have 6 total, we've used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.

But we don't know which one it is.

We can also consider other words? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""dowle""? Not a word.

""bowst"" not a word.

So only two real options.

But we can also think of ""loups"" no.

Perhaps ""poult"" but that ends with T? But pattern: P O U L T → positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T → but we need position4 to be S, not L. So not.

So back to ""boost"" and ""joust"".

We might choose ""joust"" because it tests U, which is a vowel we haven't tried? But we know the word has O, and we've eliminated A, E, I, so the only vowel left is U? Or Y? But Y is sometimes a vowel.

But the word must have at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but English words usually do. But we have O, which is a vowel.

So it might not have U.

But we don't know.

To be safe, we can choose ""boost"" because B is more common.

But let's see the frequency: in 5-letter words ending with ""ST"", what are common first letters? Or third letters?

Common words: ""most"" but that's 4 letters.

""boost"" and ""joust"" are both valid.

I think we should pick one arbitrarily. Let's go with ""boost"" because it has a common letter B.

So guess ""boost"".

But we have to consider: if we guess ""boost"" and it's wrong, we get information about B and the third letter O? But if the third letter is not O, then we know it must be something else, and we can try ""joust"" next.

Similarly, if we guess ""joust"" and it's wrong, we try ""boost"".

But we have three guesses left, so we can afford to test.

But we might get lucky.

Another idea: we can guess a word that doesn't fit the pattern but tests many new letters? For example, a word like ""bulky"" but that doesn't have the known positions? That might not be efficient because we know three positions.

For example, if we guess ""pulpy"", then we don't use the known positions, so we might not get as much information? And we waste the chance to solve.

So better to stick to the pattern.

I think we'll guess ""boost"".

<guess>boost</guess>

But let's confirm: ""boost"" is B O O S T.

Pattern: position1: B, position2: O (correct), position3: O, position4: S (correct), position5: T (correct).

We'll see if the third letter is O or not.

If it is, we win. If not, we know it's not O, and we can try ""joust"" next.

But if the third letter is not O and not U? Then what? We have to consider other possibilities.

What other letters can be in position3? For example, if the word is ""yowst"" but not a word.

Or ""lowst"" not a word.

So actually, the only common words are ""boost"" and ""joust"". If it's not one of these, it might be a less common word? But we have to assume it's a common word.

Another word: ""fouat"" no.

Or ""douar"" no.

I think for the purpose of this game, we can assume ""boost"" or ""joust"".

So let's go with ""boost"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), eliminating these letters.
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** → O is correct and in position 2 (✓), S is correct and in position 4 (✓), T is correct and in position 5 (✓). M and I are absent (x), eliminating M and I.
- **Guess 3: ""ghost""** → O, S, and T are confirmed correct in positions 2, 4, and 5 (✓), as before. G and H are absent (x), eliminating G and H.

The secret word pattern is: **\_ O \_ S T** (position 2 is O, position 4 is S, position 5 is T). Eliminated letters are: **C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G, H**.

Possible words fitting this pattern must use available letters (e.g., B, D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). Common English words that match:
- **boost**: B at position 1, O at position 3 (double O).
- **joust**: J at position 1, U at position 3.

""boost"" is chosen as the next guess because:
- It tests the common letter B in position 1.
- It checks if the third letter is O (possible duplicate), which could solve the word immediately if correct.
- If incorrect, feedback on B and the third letter will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if B is absent or misplaced, or if O is not duplicated, ""joust"" can be tried next).

<guess>boost</guess>",boost,"We are on the fourth guess. Previous feedback:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" → C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- Guess 2: ""moist"" → M and I are not in the word. O is correct at position 2, S is correct at position 4, T is correct at position 5.
- Guess 3: ""ghost"" → G and H are not in the word. O, S, T are correct (positions 2,4,5 as before).

So the secret word pattern is: _ O _ S T

Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, G, H.

We need to find a word that fits the pattern and uses only letters not eliminated.

Available letters: We have not tried: B, D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- boost: B O O S T → but we have two O's? The pattern requires the second letter O and the fourth S and fifth T. The third letter would be O? So ""boost"" has B at position 1 and O at position 3?

- joust: J O U S T → J at 1, U at 3. U is available.

- moist: already tried and had I which is eliminated.
- toast: T at 1 and A at 3? But A is eliminated → not possible.
- worst: W at 1, R at 3 → R eliminated → not possible.
- boost and joust are the main ones.

But are there others?
- dowst: not a word.
- foust: not a word.
- jowst: not a word.
- lowst: not a word.
- powst: not a word.
- rowst: not a word, and R eliminated.
- vowst: not a word.
- wowst: not a word.
- yowst: not a word.

What about ""boast""? But A is eliminated.

""boosts"" is 6 letters.

Another: ""brosy"" no, pattern doesn't match.

So common words: boost, joust.

Also, ""joist"" but I eliminated.

""frost"" but R and F? F is available, but R is eliminated? ""frost"": F R O S T → R is eliminated → not possible.

""ghost"" we tried.

So we have two strong candidates: ""boost"" and ""joust"".

We need to choose one. We can also consider if there are words with other letters.

What about ""dowst""? Not a word.

""howst"" not a word.

""joust"" and ""boost"" are the only common ones.

We can also consider ""yourt"" or something? Not a word.

So let's choose between ""boost"" and ""joust"".

We want to test new letters. ""boost"" has B and O (O is already known, so we are testing B and the possibility of double O? But we don't know if O is duplicated).

""joust"" has J and U, which are less common? But U is a vowel we haven't tested.

We might prefer to test more common letters? But B is more common than J and U.

Letter frequency: B is more common than J and U.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

Because position3 is taken by O in this guess? 

Actually, in ""boost"", we are setting position1 to B and position3 to O.

So if the secret word is ""joust"", then:
- Position1: B vs J → B is not in the word? Then x.
- Position3: O vs U → O is in the word but at position2? So if the secret word has only one O (at position2), then O at position3 would be wrong? But we know O is at position2, so if the secret word has only one O, then O at position3 is not present? So it would be x? But wait, the feedback for O: we have O at position2 which is correct, and O at position3? If the word has only one O, then the O at position3 would be marked as not in the word?

Standard Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret word has one O, and you guess two O's, one in the correct position and one not, then the correct one gets ✓ and the other gets x (because there's no second O to match).

So in ""boost"" for a secret word with only one O (like ""joust"" which has one O at position2):
  - Position2: O → ✓ (correct)
  - Position3: O → x (because no second O in the word)

Similarly, for position1: B → if not in the word, x.

So if we guess ""boost"" and the word is ""joust"", we get: B(x), O(✓), O(x), S(✓), T(✓) → so we know that the third letter is not O and B is not in the word.

Then we can try ""joust"" next.

But if we guess ""joust"" first, and the word is ""boost"", then:
  - Position1: J vs B → J not in word? x
  - Position2: O ✓
  - Position3: U vs O → U not in word? x (if no U) and O is in the word but at position2? So U is not in the word → x
  - Position4: S ✓
  - Position5: T ✓
  So feedback: J(x), O(✓), U(x), S(✓), T(✓) → then we know the word has no J, U, and the third letter is not U. Then we can try ""boost"".

So either way, we might need two guesses? But we have three guesses left? We are on guess 4, so we have 3 more? No, we have 6 total, we've used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), eliminating these letters.
