We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can give us good information.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize the information we get.
 Common starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""ROAST"".

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Alternatively, I can choose ""CRANE"" which is a popular starter.

 But let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The letters in ""CRANE"" are C, R, A, N, E. 
 These are all fairly common.

 Another popular one is ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

 I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it has two of the most common vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (S, L, T).

 So, my first guess is ""SLATE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""slate"": 
 S(✓) -> S is in the correct position (position 1).
 L(x) -> L is not in the word at all.
 A(x) -> A is not in the word at all.
 T(x) -> T is not in the word at all.
 E(x) -> E is not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word starts with S and does not contain L, A, T, or E.

 Since the secret word starts with S and is 5 letters, we know the first letter is S.

 Also, we know that the word does not contain: L, A, T, E.

 We have to choose a new guess that is a 5-letter English word, starting with S, and avoiding the letters L, A, T, E.

 We must consider: what letters are left? We can use consonants other than L, T and vowels other than A and E? The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But Y is often considered a vowel too.

 However, note that the word does not necessarily have to start with S? Wait, no: we know the first letter is S because of the ✓. So the first letter must be S.

 So: new word must be of the form S????, and must not include L, A, T, E.

 We can also note that we have eliminated 4 letters (L, A, T, E). 

 We want a word that uses common letters that we haven't tested yet, to maximize new information.

 Common consonants we haven't tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.
 Common vowels: I, O, U (and Y).

 Given the constraints, possible words include: 
   ""slick"" -> but L is not allowed? L is forbidden, so skip.
   ""shiny"" -> S, H, I, N, Y -> no L,A,T,E? Yes, and H,I,N,Y are new. 
   ""spoon"" -> P,O,O,N -> new letters? O and P and N. But double O? We don't care, as long as it's a valid word.
   ""scion"" -> C,I,O,N -> no forbidden letters? Yes.

 However, we must consider that we have 5 positions to test. We also know that the word does not contain L, A, T, E.

 Let's think about the feedback: The first guess was ""slate"". Only S was correct and in position. The other letters were not present. So we are safe to avoid those letters.

 Among the candidates:
   ""shiny"": S, H, I, N, Y
   ""spoon"": S, P, O, O, N
   ""scion"": S, C, I, O, N

 But note, we don't know how many vowels are left. Also, we have eliminated E and A, so maybe the vowel is I, O or U.

 Another idea: we can try words that have common consonants in positions we are not sure about.

 How about ""south"": S, O, U, T, H -> but T is forbidden? Yes, T is not allowed. So skip.

 Or ""sinus"": S, I, N, U, S -> note double S? But also U. However, S is at the first and last. But we know the first letter is S. We don't know about other positions? It's valid? But our criteria: no L,A,T,E -> this has no L,A,T,E? S, I, N, U, S -> forbidden? T and E and A are absent? But U and I are vowels? Yes. However, ""sinus"" is a word? Yes.

 But we have already used S? We don't mind repeating? Actually, the rule does not forbid repeating letters? But the feedback will only mark the correct ones. However, note that the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know. But since we have S only at the start, and we don't know the rest, but if the word has an S at the end, it would be marked as present? Or only if we guess a letter that appears multiple times? The feedback rules: if the letter is present but in the wrong position, we mark as '-' even if it appears again? Actually, the example didn't show duplicates. But we have to assume the game handles duplicates correctly.

 However, to maximize new information, it is better to avoid repeating letters unless necessary? But in this case, we only know S in the first position. We don't know if S appears again? It might? But we want to test new letters.

 Since we are early in the game, better to avoid repeating S? We don't have to? We can test if there's another S? But we have limited remaining guesses. So perhaps better to use distinct letters? Unless we have a good reason.

 Let me think: we have 5 positions to test? We already know position1 is S. So our goal in the second guess is to get information about positions 2,3,4,5? But we don't know if any other letter? And we have eliminated L,A,T,E.

 We want to pick a word that uses letters we haven't tried. So avoiding L,A,T,E and S? No, wait: S is already in the first position. We can use S again? But if we use S elsewhere and it's not in the word, then we know? Or if it's in the word again? But we can't avoid S? Actually, we can avoid S because we know it's at the start? But we don't know about other positions? So we don't want to assume that S doesn't appear again? We must test?

 Alternatively, if we avoid S in other positions, we can quickly find if S is repeated? But that's a risk? Actually, let me check: if the word has S only at the first, then we avoid S elsewhere? Then we can cover more letters? But we don't know? So perhaps it's better to cover more new letters?

 Considering the constraints, let's list possible words:

 We need words starting with S, and remaining 4 letters are from the set: B,C,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,N,O,P,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding L, A, T, E).

 Common words:
   ""sound"": S, O, U, N, D -> O,U,N,D are new? But note: D is a consonant. 
   ""south"": has T? Forbidden -> skip.
   ""swing"": S, W, I, N, G -> W,I,N,G -> new letters? Yes.
   ""spike"": S, P, I, K, E -> E is forbidden -> skip.
   ""spicy"": S, P, I, C, Y -> C,Y are consonants? And P, I? But C and Y? All new? But E is not included? Correct.

 So let me consider:
   Option1: ""sound"" -> tests O,U,N,D
   Option2: ""swing"" -> W,I,N,G
   Option3: ""spicy"" -> P,I,C,Y

 We want to cover as many frequent letters as possible? Letter frequency in English: E, T, A, ... -> but we've eliminated E, A, T. Next are O, I, N, S? So O and I and N are high frequency? 

 Therefore, words that contain O, I, N might be good? So both ""sound"" and ""swing"" and ""spicy"" have at least one of these.

 But note: ""sound"" has O,U,N,D? U is less frequent? ""swing"" has W,I,N,G? W and G are less frequent? ""spicy"" has P,I,C,Y? P and C are medium?

 Another candidate: ""shock"": S,H,O,C,K -> H,O,C,K? Letters? H, O, C, K? New? And no forbidden.

 Also, ""screw"": S,C,R,E,W -> E is forbidden? Skip.

 ""scorn"": S,C,O,R,N -> C,O,R,N? R is common? Yes.

 Let's compare:

 We have:
 - ""sound"": O, U, N, D
 - ""swing"": W, I, N, G
 - ""spicy"": P, I, C, Y
 - ""shock"": H, O, C, K
 - ""scorn"": C, O, R, N

 Now, which one gives the most information? We don't have R tested? And R is common. So ""scorn"" tests R? 

 We also note that vowels: O and I? We haven't tested any? So testing both vowels? But ""scorn"" has O? ""spicy"" has I? ""swing"" has I? 

 Since we have limited vowels? After eliminating A and E, the vowels can be I, O, U? (and Y?) 

 We want to test at least one vowel? So ""scorn"" has O? ""spicy"" has I? 

 Considering we don't know which vowels? We should test a vowel? We have two vowels left? Maybe.

 How about ""silly"": S,I,L,L,Y -> but L is forbidden? So skip.

 Alternatively, ""siroc""? Not common? 

 Let's decide: we haven't tested any of the letters in ""scorn"": C, O, R, N? And O and R are very common? 

 Also, if we choose ""scorn"", we test:

   Position1: S (already known) -> but the feedback will tell us for each:

   We already know the first letter is correct? So the feedback will mark S as ✓? Then C, O, R, N? They will be marked appropriately.

 But note: the word cannot contain the forbidden letters? And we are testing 4 new letters? 

 Another candidate: ""scion"": S, C, I, O, N -> same letters as scorn? Except I and O vs O and R? Actually, ""scion"" uses C, I, O, N? 

 We haven't tested I? And I is a vowel? 

 Actually, ""scion"" might be better? Because it tests two vowels? 

 So let me choose ""scion"": meaning S, C, I, O, N.

 This word avoids L,A,T,E.

 We will get feedback on:
   S (already known -> ✓)
   C -> if C is in the word and in the right position? Or present? Or absent?
   I -> same?
   O -> same?
   N -> same?

 This will give us good information.

 So I decide to guess ""scion"".

 Answer: <guess>scion</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""slate"":  
- **S is correct and in position 1** (so the secret word starts with ""S"").  
- **L, A, T, E are absent** (so these letters cannot appear anywhere in the word).  

For the second guess, I need a word starting with ""S"" that avoids L, A, T, E. Ideally, it should test new common letters to gather more information. I chose **""scion""** because:  
- It starts with ""S"" (satisfies the known position).  
- It uses new untested letters: **C, I, O, N** (vowels I/O and common consonants C/N).  
- It avoids forbidden letters L, A, T, E.  
- This maximizes information potential for positions 2–5, helping narrow down the secret word efficiently.  

<guess>scion</guess>",scion,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""slate"":

 Another candidate: ""scion"": S, C, I, O, N -> same letters as scorn? Except I and O vs O and R? Actually, ""scion"" uses C, I, O, N? 

 We haven't tested I? And I is a vowel? 

 Actually, ""scion"" might be better? Because it tests two vowels? 

 So let me choose ""scion"": meaning S, C, I, O, N.

 This word avoids L,A,T,E.

 We will get feedback on:
   S (already known -> ✓)
   C -> if C is in the word and in the right position? Or present? Or absent?
   I -> same?
   O -> same?
   N -> same?

 This will give us good information.

 So I decide to guess ""scion"".

 Answer: <guess>scion</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""slate"":  
- **S is correct and in position 1** (so the secret word starts with ""S"").  
- **L, A, T, E are absent** (so these letters cannot appear anywhere in the word).  

For the second guess, I need a word starting with ""S"" that avoids L, A, T, E. Ideally, it should test new common letters to gather more information. I chose **""scion""** because:  
- It starts with ""S"" (satisfies the known position).  
- It uses new untested letters: **C, I, O, N** (vowels I/O and common consonants C/N).  
- It avoids forbidden letters L, A, T, E.  
- This maximizes information potential for positions 2–5, helping narrow down the secret word efficiently.",Guess 2: scion -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(-) I(x) O(-) N(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can give us good information.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize the information we get.
 Common starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""ROAST"".

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Alternatively, I can choose ""CRANE"" which is a popular starter.

 But let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The letters in ""CRANE"" are C, R, A, N, E. 
 These are all fairly common.

 Another popular one is ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

 I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it has two of the most common vowels (A and E) and three common consonants (S, L, T).

 So, my first guess is ""SLATE"".I am starting the game and need to make an effective first guess. A good starting word should include common vowels and consonants to maximize information. I choose ""SLATE"" because it contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T), which helps test multiple frequent letters in one guess. This will provide useful feedback for narrowing down the secret word.

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""slate"": 
 S(✓) -> S is in the correct position (position 1).
 L(x) -> L is not in the word at all.
 A(x) -> A is not in the word at all.
 T(x) -> T is not in the word at all.
 E(x) -> E is not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word starts with S and does not contain L, A, T, or E.

 Since the secret word starts with S and is 5 letters, we know the first letter is S.

 Also, we know that the word does not contain: L, A, T, E.

 We have to choose a new guess that is a 5-letter English word, starting with S, and avoiding the letters L, A, T, E.

 We must consider: what letters are left? We can use consonants other than L, T and vowels other than A and E? The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But Y is often considered a vowel too.

 However, note that the word does not necessarily have to start with S? Wait, no: we know the first letter is S because of the ✓. So the first letter must be S.

 So: new word must be of the form S????, and must not include L, A, T, E.

 We can also note that we have eliminated 4 letters (L, A, T, E). 

 We want a word that uses common letters that we haven't tested yet, to maximize new information.

 Common consonants we haven't tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.
 Common vowels: I, O, U (and Y).

 Given the constraints, possible words include: 
   ""slick"" -> but L is not allowed? L is forbidden, so skip.
   ""shiny"" -> S, H, I, N, Y -> no L,A,T,E? Yes, and H,I,N,Y are new. 
   ""spoon"" -> P,O,O,N -> new letters? O and P and N. But double O? We don't care, as long as it's a valid word.
   ""scion"" -> C,I,O,N -> no forbidden letters? Yes.

 However, we must consider that we have 5 positions to test. We also know that the word does not contain L, A, T, E.

 Let's think about the feedback: The first guess was ""slate"". Only S was correct and in position. The other letters were not present. So we are safe to avoid those letters.

 Among the candidates:
   ""shiny"": S, H, I, N, Y
   ""spoon"": S, P, O, O, N
   ""scion"": S, C, I, O, N

 But note, we don't know how many vowels are left. Also, we have eliminated E and A, so maybe the vowel is I, O or U.

 Another idea: we can try words that have common consonants in positions we are not sure about.

 How about ""south"": S, O, U, T, H -> but T is forbidden? Yes, T is not allowed. So skip.

 Or ""sinus"": S, I, N, U, S -> note double S? But also U. However, S is at the first and last. But we know the first letter is S. We don't know about other positions? It's valid? But our criteria: no L,A,T,E -> this has no L,A,T,E? S, I, N, U, S -> forbidden? T and E and A are absent? But U and I are vowels? Yes. However, ""sinus"" is a word? Yes.

 But we have already used S? We don't mind repeating? Actually, the rule does not forbid repeating letters? But the feedback will only mark the correct ones. However, note that the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know. But since we have S only at the start, and we don't know the rest, but if the word has an S at the end, it would be marked as present? Or only if we guess a letter that appears multiple times? The feedback rules: if the letter is present but in the wrong position, we mark as '-' even if it appears again? Actually, the example didn't show duplicates. But we have to assume the game handles duplicates correctly.

 However, to maximize new information, it is better to avoid repeating letters unless necessary? But in this case, we only know S in the first position. We don't know if S appears again? It might? But we want to test new letters.

 Since we are early in the game, better to avoid repeating S? We don't have to? We can test if there's another S? But we have limited remaining guesses. So perhaps better to use distinct letters? Unless we have a good reason.

 Let me think: we have 5 positions to test? We already know position1 is S. So our goal in the second guess is to get information about positions 2,3,4,5? But we don't know if any other letter? And we have eliminated L,A,T,E.

 We want to pick a word that uses letters we haven't tried. So avoiding L,A,T,E and S? No, wait: S is already in the first position. We can use S again? But if we use S elsewhere and it's not in the word, then we know? Or if it's in the word again? But we can't avoid S? Actually, we can avoid S because we know it's at the start? But we don't know about other positions? So we don't want to assume that S doesn't appear again? We must test?

 Alternatively, if we avoid S in other positions, we can quickly find if S is repeated? But that's a risk? Actually, let me check: if the word has S only at the first, then we avoid S elsewhere? Then we can cover more letters? But we don't know? So perhaps it's better to cover more new letters?

 Considering the constraints, let's list possible words:

 We need words starting with S, and remaining 4 letters are from the set: B,C,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,N,O,P,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding L, A, T, E).

 Common words:
   ""sound"": S, O, U, N, D -> O,U,N,D are new? But note: D is a consonant. 
   ""south"": has T? Forbidden -> skip.
   ""swing"": S, W, I, N, G -> W,I,N,G -> new letters? Yes.
   ""spike"": S, P, I, K, E -> E is forbidden -> skip.
   ""spicy"": S, P, I, C, Y -> C,Y are consonants? And P, I? But C and Y? All new? But E is not included? Correct.

 So let me consider:
   Option1: ""sound"" -> tests O,U,N,D
   Option2: ""swing"" -> W,I,N,G
   Option3: ""spicy"" -> P,I,C,Y

 We want to cover as many frequent letters as possible? Letter frequency in English: E, T, A, ... -> but we've eliminated E, A, T. Next are O, I, N, S? So O and I and N are high frequency? 

 Therefore, words that contain O, I, N might be good? So both ""sound"" and ""swing"" and ""spicy"" have at least one of these.

 But note: ""sound"" has O,U,N,D? U is less frequent? ""swing"" has W,I,N,G? W and G are less frequent? ""spicy"" has P,I,C,Y? P and C are medium?

 Another candidate: ""shock"": S,H,O,C,K -> H,O,C,K? Letters? H, O, C, K? New? And no forbidden.

 Also, ""screw"": S,C,R,E,W -> E is forbidden? Skip.

 ""scorn"": S,C,O,R,N -> C,O,R,N? R is common? Yes.

 Let's compare:

 We have:
 - ""sound"": O, U, N, D
 - ""swing"": W, I, N, G
 - ""spicy"": P, I, C, Y
 - ""shock"": H, O, C, K
 - ""scorn"": C, O, R, N

 Now, which one gives the most information? We don't have R tested? And R is common. So ""scorn"" tests R? 

 We also note that vowels: O and I? We haven't tested any? So testing both vowels? But ""scorn"" has O? ""spicy"" has I? ""swing"" has I? 

 Since we have limited vowels? After eliminating A and E, the vowels can be I, O, U? (and Y?) 

 We want to test at least one vowel? So ""scorn"" has O? ""spicy"" has I? 

 Considering we don't know which vowels? We should test a vowel? We have two vowels left? Maybe.

 How about ""silly"": S,I,L,L,Y -> but L is forbidden? So skip.

 Alternatively, ""siroc""? Not common? 

 Let's decide: we haven't tested any of the letters in ""scorn"": C, O, R, N? And O and R are very common? 

 Also, if we choose ""scorn"", we test:

   Position1: S (already known) -> but the feedback will tell us for each:

   We already know the first letter is correct? So the feedback will mark S as ✓? Then C, O, R, N? They will be marked appropriately.

 But note: the word cannot contain the forbidden letters? And we are testing 4 new letters? 

 Another candidate: ""scion"": S, C, I, O, N -> same letters as scorn? Except I and O vs O and R? Actually, ""scion"" uses C, I, O, N? 

 We haven't tested I? And I is a vowel? 

 Actually, ""scion"" might be better? Because it tests two vowels? 

 So let me choose ""scion"": meaning S, C, I, O, N.

 This word avoids L,A,T,E.

 We will get feedback on:
   S (already known -> ✓)
   C -> if C is in the word and in the right position? Or present? Or absent?
   I -> same?
   O -> same?
   N -> same?

 This will give us good information.

 So I decide to guess ""scion"".

 Answer: <guess>scion</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""slate"":

- O is present in the word but not in position 4 (so it must be in one of positions 2,3,5? But note: position 4 in ""scion"" is O, so it's marked as '-' meaning present but not in that position).
- N is absent.

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The word starts with S.
2. The word contains C and O, but not in the positions we guessed.
   - C is not in position 2 (so it must be in 3,4, or 5).
   - O is not in position 4 (so it must be in 2,3, or 5).
3. The word does not contain: L, A, T, E, I, N.

Also, note that we have two present letters: C and O.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains C and O (since they are present, and we know they are in the word, but not in the positions we tried).
- Does not contain L, A, T, E, I, N.

Additionally, we must avoid using any of the absent letters.

Now, let's think about the positions:

- Position 1: S (fixed).
- Position 2: We know C is not here (from guess2: C was in position2 and got '-', meaning it's present but not in pos2). So position2 cannot be C. Also, it cannot be O? Not necessarily, because O could be in position2? Actually, in guess2, O was in position4 and got '-', meaning O is in the word but not in position4. It could be in position2? Yes.

So possible positions for C: 3,4,5.
Possible positions for O: 2,3,5.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any indication of duplicates so far? And the feedback doesn't show duplicates? We have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But for now, we assume no duplicates? Or we can't assume? Actually, we should not assume. But since we have limited information, we can try to avoid duplicates for now? But we must be cautious.

We also need to fill the other letters? We have 5 positions: S _ _ _ _

We know the word has C and O, and two other letters? But we don't know the total? It could have more? But we have only two present letters? So the other two letters must be from the letters we haven't tried? Or they could be duplicates? But we don't know.

We have eliminated: L, A, T, E, I, N.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and also C and O are in the word, but we already know we have to use them).

We need to form a word that starts with S, has C and O (each at least once), and two other letters from the available set? Or possibly duplicates? But let's first try without duplicates.

We also know the positions: 
- C cannot be in position2 (so positions 3,4,5 for C)
- O cannot be in position4 (so positions 2,3,5 for O)

But note: if we put O in position2, then C must be in 3,4, or 5? And if we put C in position3, then O can be in 2 or 5? etc.

We need to choose a word that fits these constraints and tests new letters.

Possible words:

Let me think of words starting with S, having C and O, and avoiding the forbidden letters.

Common words:

- ""scoop"": S, C, O, O, P -> but has double O? And P. But we haven't tested P? Also, O is in position3 and position4? But in our feedback, O was not in position4? So if we put O in position4, that would be invalid? Actually, in ""scoop"", the O is in position3 and position4? But we know O is not in position4? So if we use ""scoop"", then the O in position4 would be wrong? But we know O is in the word, so it must be that the O in position3 is the one that is present? But then the O in position4 might be absent? But the word has two O's? We don't know? Actually, the feedback for ""scion"" only said O is present but not in position4. It doesn't say how many times? So the word could have two O's? But we don't know? However, we are not sure? So we can try? But we want to avoid confusion? Maybe better to avoid duplicates for now? 

Alternatively, ""scout"": S, C, O, U, T -> but T is forbidden? We know T is absent? So skip.

""shock"": S, H, O, C, K -> but we have O and C? And H and K? But note the positions: 
- S (1), H (2), O (3), C (4), K (5)
But we know from feedback: 
  C must not be in position2? Here it's in position4 -> okay.
  O must not be in position4? Here it's in position3 -> okay.

Also, H and K are new? And not forbidden? 

But wait, in ""shock"", we have O in position3 and C in position4? 

But we don't know if that's correct? We are just guessing.

Another word: ""scowl"": S, C, O, W, L -> but L is forbidden? Skip.

""scour"": S, C, O, U, R -> U and R? 
- Positions: S(1), C(2) -> but wait, we know C cannot be in position2? Because in guess2, C was in position2 and got '-'. So if we put C in position2 again, it would be wrong? So we cannot put C in position2? 

Therefore, ""scour"" has C in position2? That's invalid? Because we know C is not in position2? So we must avoid putting C in position2.

Similarly, we must avoid putting O in position4.

So in our new guess, we must:
- Put C in position 3,4, or 5.
- Put O in position 2,3, or 5.

Now, let's try to form words:

Option: put O in position2? Then the word is: S O ? ? ?

And C must be in 3,4, or 5.

And the other letters must be from the available set.

Words: 
  ""sodac"": not a word? 
  ""sodic"": S O D I C -> but I is forbidden? Skip.
  ""sonic"": S O N I C -> but N and I are forbidden? Skip.
  ""sophs"": S O P H S -> has S at the end? But we don't know if S is repeated? And P and H? But we have C? No, missing C? We need to include C? 

We must include C? Because we know C is in the word? So the word must have C.

So if we put O in position2, then we need C in 3,4, or5? And the other two positions must be filled with available letters.

For example: 
  ""socle"": S O C L E -> but L and E are forbidden? Skip.
  ""socko"": S O C K O -> O at the end? And K? But we have two O's? 
      Positions: S(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), O(5)
      We know O is not in position4? Here we have O in 2 and 5? So position4 is K? That's okay? 
      But we have to check if O is allowed in position5? Yes, because the feedback only said O is not in position4? 
      Also, we avoid forbidden letters? L,A,T,E,I,N? Yes? 
      But is ""socko"" a word? It might be informal? But let's assume it's acceptable? Or we can use a better word.

  ""soces"": not a word.

Alternatively, put O in position3? Then the word: S ? O ? ?

And C must be in 3,4,5? But position3 is O? So C cannot be in position3? Then C must be in 4 or 5.

Words:
  ""spock"": S P O C K -> P and K? 
      Positions: S(1), P(2), O(3), C(4), K(5) -> this seems good? 
      We have C in position4? And O in position3? 
      We know O is not in position4? Correct? And C is not in position2? Correct? 
      Also, P and K are new? 
      And no forbidden letters? 

  ""stock"": S T O C K -> but T is forbidden? Skip.
  ""smock"": S M O C K -> M and K? 
  ""shock"": we thought earlier? S H O C K -> H and K? 

But note: we have to avoid position2 for C? And position4 for O? In ""shock"": 
  Position2: H -> not C? Good.
  Position4: C -> but we have O in position3? And C in position4? 
  We know O is not in position4? That's fine because O is in position3? 
  And C is in position4? Which is allowed? 

So ""shock"" is a candidate? 

But we also have ""spock"" (if we consider it a word? It's a proper noun? Maybe not ideal?).

Another candidate: ""scowp""? Not a word.

Put O in position5? Then word: S ? ? ? O

And C must be in 3,4? (since position5 is O, so C can be in 3 or 4? But not 5? Because O is there? And we can't have two letters in the same position? So C in 3 or 4? 

Words:
  ""scudo"": S C U D O -> but C is in position2? We cannot put C in position2? Skip.
  ""sucro"": not a word? 
  ""sacro"": S A C R O -> but A is forbidden? Skip.
  ""micro"": M I C R O -> but doesn't start with S? 

So not many options? 

Therefore, the best candidates are:
  ""shock"": S, H, O, C, K
  ""smock"": S, M, O, C, K
  ""spock"": S, P, O, C, K (if allowed)
  ""socko"": S, O, C, K, O (if allowed, but double O? and we don't know if O is repeated? But we have to test? Also, ""socko"" might not be common)

We also have ""scow"": but that's 4 letters? 

Another one: ""scoot"": S, C, O, O, T -> T is forbidden? Skip.

""brook"": doesn't start with S.

How about ""shook"": S, H, O, O, K -> but we don't have C? We must include C? Because we know C is in the word? So we cannot skip C.

So we must have both C and O? 

Therefore, ""shock"" and ""smock"" are good? 

But we also have ""scour"" but we cannot because C is in position2? 

Wait, what about ""score"": S, C, O, R, E -> but E is forbidden? Skip.

""scorn"": we used in guess2? But we already tried? And we got feedback? We cannot reuse? We can? But we know that in ""scorn"", we had C in position2 (which we now know is wrong) and O in position4 (which we now know is wrong for O? But wait, in guess2 we had ""scion"", which had O in position4? And we got O(-) meaning O is present but not in position4? So if we use ""scorn"", we would have O in position4 again? Which we know is wrong? So it would be a waste? 

So we should avoid putting O in position4? And avoid putting C in position2? 

Therefore, ""shock"" is a good candidate? 

But let me check the positions: 
  S (1) -> correct
  H (2) -> new letter? 
  O (3) -> we haven't tested position3 for O? 
  C (4) -> we haven't tested position4 for C? 
  K (5) -> new letter? 

We get to test H, O in position3, C in position4, and K? 

But we know O is present? So if we put O in position3, and if it's correct? Then we get a ✓? Or if not? Then we know O is not in position3? Similarly for C in position4? 

But we also test H and K? 

Alternatively, we can try to test more new letters? 

Another candidate: ""sculp"": S, C, U, L, P -> but L is forbidden? Skip.

""scudo"": S, C, U, D, O -> but C is in position2? Not allowed? 

""scrod"": S, C, R, O, D -> C in position2? Not allowed? 

""crowd"": doesn't start with S.

How about ""sword"": S, W, O, R, D -> but we don't have C? We must include C? 

So we must have C? 

Another idea: ""scoop"": S, C, O, O, P -> but C is in position2? Not allowed? 

Unless we can put C in a different position? But in ""scoop"", C is fixed in position2? 

So we cannot use words that have C in position2? 

Therefore, we are left with words that have C in position3,4, or5? And O in position2,3, or5? But not position4? 

And we have to avoid the forbidden letters? 

Let me list more words:

- ""bocce"": not starting with S? 
- ""focus"": not starting with S? 
- ""jocks"": not starting with S? 
- ""yocks"": not starting with S? 

We need S at the start? 

So: 
  Position1: S
  Position2: cannot be C? And we can put O? Or other letters? 
  Then position3: can be O? Or C? Or other? 
  Position4: can be C? But not O? 
  Position5: can be O? Or C? 

So let's try:

  S _ O _ C -> but then O is in position3? And C in position5? 
  Example: ""shooc""? Not a word? 
  ""snooc""? Not a word? 

  S _ C _ O -> then C in position3? And O in position5? 
  Example: ""shuco""? Not a word? 
  ""sicko"": S I C K O -> but I is forbidden? Skip.
  ""sucky"": S U C K Y -> U, C, K, Y? But we don't have O? We must have O? 

  S O _ C _ -> O in position2? C in position4? 
  Example: ""sodcy""? Not a word? 
  ""sowce""? Not a word? 
  ""sorcs""? S O R C S -> but R and S? And we have S at the end? 
      But we know S is at the start? But if the word has another S? We don't know? 
      ""sorcs"" is not a word? 

  S O C _ _ -> but C in position3? But we cannot put C in position3? No, we can? Because C can be in position3? 
      But then we have to avoid O in position4? So the last two cannot be O? 
      Example: ""socle"" -> forbidden? 
      ""socko"": S O C K O -> O in position2 and 5? C in position3? 
          This is a word? (informal: socko meaning very successful? or a name? but we can use it? or find a better one? 
          But we have O in position5? And we know O is not in position4? So that's okay? 
          Also, K is new? 
          And we avoid forbidden letters? 

  S _ _ C O -> then C in position4? O in position5? 
      Example: ""shock"" is not? Because that has O in position3? 
      ""smock"" is S M O C K -> not this pattern? 
      ""spaco""? Not a word? 
      ""sirco""? Not a word? 

So the only common words we have are like ""shock"", ""smock"", and ""socko"". 

I think ""shock"" is a common word? So I'll go with ""shock"". 

But note: in ""shock"", we have:
  Position1: S (correct)
  Position2: H (new)
  Position3: O (we know O is present? So if it's in the correct position? We get ✓? Or if not? We get '-'? 
  Position4: C (we know C is present? So same? 
  Position5: K (new)

This will give us information about the positions of O and C? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O and C in positions we haven't tested? And also tests new letters? 

Another candidate: ""scudo"" -> but C in position2? Not allowed? 

""scow"": too short? 

""scowl"": L forbidden? 

""scour"": C in position2? Not allowed? 

""crops"": doesn't start with S? 

I think ""shock"" is a good choice? 

But let me check if there is a word with O in position5 and C in position3? 

For example: ""sulco""? Not a word? 

Or ""soc"" is too short? 

So I'll go with ""shock"". 

But wait, we have another candidate: ""smock"" is also good? 

""smock"": S, M, O, C, K -> same as shock? But with M instead of H? 

Both are valid? 

We can choose either? 

But we want to test more common letters? H is more common than M? 

In English, H is more frequent? 

So ""shock"" might be better? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a vowel? We have O? But we also have U? We haven't tested U? 

But in ""shock"", we don't test U? 

How about ""scout""? But T is forbidden? 

""sculp"": L forbidden? 

""scums"": S, C, U, M, S -> but C is in position2? Not allowed? 

""scups"": same? 

So I think ""shock"" is a good guess? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""shock"". 

But note: we are not sure if the word has H or K? But we are testing? 

So the guess is ""shock"". 

But let me double-check the feedback: 

In guess2, we had ""scion"" -> C was in position2 and got '-', meaning C is present but not in position2? So we avoid position2 for C? 

In ""shock"", C is in position4? So that's okay? 

O is in position3? And we know O is present? But we don't know if it's in position3? So we test? 

Also, we avoid all forbidden letters? 

So I think it's valid? 

<guess>shock</guess>
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""slate"" → S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)**  
  - **S** is correct and in position 1 (secret word starts with **S**).  
  - **L, A, T, E** are absent (cannot appear anywhere).  

- **Guess 2: ""scion"" → S(✓) C(-) I(x) O(-) N(x)**  
  - **S** is correct and in position 1 (confirmed).  
  - **C** is present but not in position 2 (must be in position 3, 4, or 5).  
  - **I** and **N** are absent (cannot appear anywhere).  
  - **O** is present but not in position 4 (must be in position 2, 3, or 5).  

### Key Constraints:
- **Position 1**: Must be **S**.  
- **Must include**: **C** and **O** (since they are present).  
  - **C** cannot be in position 2.  
  - **O** cannot be in position 4.  
- **Absent letters**: L, A, T, E, I, N (cannot use these).  
- **Untested letters**: Many consonants remain (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, R, U, W, Y).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Prioritize testing positions for C and O**:  
  - **C** must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
  - **O** must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
- **Maximize new information**: Use common letters not yet tested (e.g., H, K, M, P) to cover more ground.  
- **Avoid risky duplicates**: No evidence of duplicate letters yet, so prioritize distinct letters.  
- **Strong candidate words**:  
  - **""shock"" (S, H, O, C, K)**:  
    - Tests **O** in position 3 and **C** in position 4 (both valid per constraints).  
    - Uses new common letters **H** and **K**.  
    - Avoids all forbidden letters.  
  - Other options (e.g., ""smock"") were considered, but **""shock""** is preferred due to higher frequency of **H** vs. **M**.  

### Why ""shock""?
- Tests **O** in position 3 and **C** in position 4, which could confirm/deny their exact locations.  
- Introduces **H** (position 2) and **K** (position 5), both high-frequency consonants.  
- Fits all constraints and avoids wasted letters.  

<guess>shock</guess>",shock,"We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""slate"" -> S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- S is correct and in the correct position (position 1).
- L, A, T, E are absent from the word.

Guess 2: ""scion"" -> S(✓) C(-) I(x) O(-) N(x)
Meaning:
- S is correct and in the correct position (position 1) [we already knew this].
- C is present in the word but not in position 2 (so it must be in one of positions 3,4,5).
- I is absent from the word.
- O is present in the word but not in position 4 (so it must be in one of positions 2,3,5? But note: position 4 in ""scion"" is O, so it's marked as '-' meaning present but not in that position).
- N is absent.

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The word starts with S.
2. The word contains C and O, but not in the positions we guessed.
   - C is not in position 2 (so it must be in 3,4, or 5).
   - O is not in position 4 (so it must be in 2,3, or 5).
3. The word does not contain: L, A, T, E, I, N.

Also, note that we have two present letters: C and O.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains C and O (since they are present, and we know they are in the word, but not in the positions we tried).
- Does not contain L, A, T, E, I, N.

Additionally, we must avoid using any of the absent letters.

Now, let's think about the positions:

- Position 1: S (fixed).
- Position 2: We know C is not here (from guess2: C was in position2 and got '-', meaning it's present but not in pos2). So position2 cannot be C. Also, it cannot be O? Not necessarily, because O could be in position2? Actually, in guess2, O was in position4 and got '-', meaning O is in the word but not in position4. It could be in position2? Yes.

So possible positions for C: 3,4,5.
Possible positions for O: 2,3,5.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any indication of duplicates so far? And the feedback doesn't show duplicates? We have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But for now, we assume no duplicates? Or we can't assume? Actually, we should not assume. But since we have limited information, we can try to avoid duplicates for now? But we must be cautious.

We also need to fill the other letters? We have 5 positions: S _ _ _ _

We know the word has C and O, and two other letters? But we don't know the total? It could have more? But we have only two present letters? So the other two letters must be from the letters we haven't tried? Or they could be duplicates? But we don't know.

We have eliminated: L, A, T, E, I, N.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and also C and O are in the word, but we already know we have to use them).

We need to form a word that starts with S, has C and O (each at least once), and two other letters from the available set? Or possibly duplicates? But let's first try without duplicates.

We also know the positions: 
- C cannot be in position2 (so positions 3,4,5 for C)
- O cannot be in position4 (so positions 2,3,5 for O)

But note: if we put O in position2, then C must be in 3,4, or 5? And if we put C in position3, then O can be in 2 or 5? etc.

We need to choose a word that fits these constraints and tests new letters.

Possible words:

Let me think of words starting with S, having C and O, and avoiding the forbidden letters.

Common words:

- ""scoop"": S, C, O, O, P -> but has double O? And P. But we haven't tested P? Also, O is in position3 and position4? But in our feedback, O was not in position4? So if we put O in position4, that would be invalid? Actually, in ""scoop"", the O is in position3 and position4? But we know O is not in position4? So if we use ""scoop"", then the O in position4 would be wrong? But we know O is in the word, so it must be that the O in position3 is the one that is present? But then the O in position4 might be absent? But the word has two O's? We don't know? Actually, the feedback for ""scion"" only said O is present but not in position4. It doesn't say how many times? So the word could have two O's? But we don't know? However, we are not sure? So we can try? But we want to avoid confusion? Maybe better to avoid duplicates for now? 

Alternatively, ""scout"": S, C, O, U, T -> but T is forbidden? We know T is absent? So skip.

""shock"": S, H, O, C, K -> but we have O and C? And H and K? But note the positions: 
- S (1), H (2), O (3), C (4), K (5)
But we know from feedback: 
  C must not be in position2? Here it's in position4 -> okay.
  O must not be in position4? Here it's in position3 -> okay.

Also, H and K are new? And not forbidden? 

But wait, in ""shock"", we have O in position3 and C in position4? 

But we don't know if that's correct? We are just guessing.

Another word: ""scowl"": S, C, O, W, L -> but L is forbidden? Skip.

""scour"": S, C, O, U, R -> U and R? 
- Positions: S(1), C(2) -> but wait, we know C cannot be in position2? Because in guess2, C was in position2 and got '-'. So if we put C in position2 again, it would be wrong? So we cannot put C in position2? 

Therefore, ""scour"" has C in position2? That's invalid? Because we know C is not in position2? So we must avoid putting C in position2.

Similarly, we must avoid putting O in position4.

So in our new guess, we must:
- Put C in position 3,4, or 5.
- Put O in position 2,3, or 5.

Now, let's try to form words:

Option: put O in position2? Then the word is: S O ? ? ?

And C must be in 3,4, or 5.

And the other letters must be from the available set.

Words: 
  ""sodac"": not a word? 
  ""sodic"": S O D I C -> but I is forbidden? Skip.
  ""sonic"": S O N I C -> but N and I are forbidden? Skip.
  ""sophs"": S O P H S -> has S at the end? But we don't know if S is repeated? And P and H? But we have C? No, missing C? We need to include C? 

We must include C? Because we know C is in the word? So the word must have C.

So if we put O in position2, then we need C in 3,4, or5? And the other two positions must be filled with available letters.

For example: 
  ""socle"": S O C L E -> but L and E are forbidden? Skip.
  ""socko"": S O C K O -> O at the end? And K? But we have two O's? 
      Positions: S(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), O(5)
      We know O is not in position4? Here we have O in 2 and 5? So position4 is K? That's okay? 
      But we have to check if O is allowed in position5? Yes, because the feedback only said O is not in position4? 
      Also, we avoid forbidden letters? L,A,T,E,I,N? Yes? 
      But is ""socko"" a word? It might be informal? But let's assume it's acceptable? Or we can use a better word.

  ""soces"": not a word.

Alternatively, put O in position3? Then the word: S ? O ? ?

And C must be in 3,4,5? But position3 is O? So C cannot be in position3? Then C must be in 4 or 5.

Words:
  ""spock"": S P O C K -> P and K? 
      Positions: S(1), P(2), O(3), C(4), K(5) -> this seems good? 
      We have C in position4? And O in position3? 
      We know O is not in position4? Correct? And C is not in position2? Correct? 
      Also, P and K are new? 
      And no forbidden letters? 

  ""stock"": S T O C K -> but T is forbidden? Skip.
  ""smock"": S M O C K -> M and K? 
  ""shock"": we thought earlier? S H O C K -> H and K? 

But note: we have to avoid position2 for C? And position4 for O? In ""shock"": 
  Position2: H -> not C? Good.
  Position4: C -> but we have O in position3? And C in position4? 
  We know O is not in position4? That's fine because O is in position3? 
  And C is in position4? Which is allowed? 

So ""shock"" is a candidate? 

But we also have ""spock"" (if we consider it a word? It's a proper noun? Maybe not ideal?).

Another candidate: ""scowp""? Not a word.

Put O in position5? Then word: S ? ? ? O

And C must be in 3,4? (since position5 is O, so C can be in 3 or 4? But not 5? Because O is there? And we can't have two letters in the same position? So C in 3 or 4? 

Words:
  ""scudo"": S C U D O -> but C is in position2? We cannot put C in position2? Skip.
  ""sucro"": not a word? 
  ""sacro"": S A C R O -> but A is forbidden? Skip.
  ""micro"": M I C R O -> but doesn't start with S? 

So not many options? 

Therefore, the best candidates are:
  ""shock"": S, H, O, C, K
  ""smock"": S, M, O, C, K
  ""spock"": S, P, O, C, K (if allowed)
  ""socko"": S, O, C, K, O (if allowed, but double O? and we don't know if O is repeated? But we have to test? Also, ""socko"" might not be common)

We also have ""scow"": but that's 4 letters? 

Another one: ""scoot"": S, C, O, O, T -> T is forbidden? Skip.

""brook"": doesn't start with S.

How about ""shook"": S, H, O, O, K -> but we don't have C? We must include C? Because we know C is in the word? So we cannot skip C.

So we must have both C and O? 

Therefore, ""shock"" and ""smock"" are good? 

But we also have ""scour"" but we cannot because C is in position2? 

Wait, what about ""score"": S, C, O, R, E -> but E is forbidden? Skip.

""scorn"": we used in guess2? But we already tried? And we got feedback? We cannot reuse? We can? But we know that in ""scorn"", we had C in position2 (which we now know is wrong) and O in position4 (which we now know is wrong for O? But wait, in guess2 we had ""scion"", which had O in position4? And we got O(-) meaning O is present but not in position4? So if we use ""scorn"", we would have O in position4 again? Which we know is wrong? So it would be a waste? 

So we should avoid putting O in position4? And avoid putting C in position2? 

Therefore, ""shock"" is a good candidate? 

But let me check the positions: 
  S (1) -> correct
  H (2) -> new letter? 
  O (3) -> we haven't tested position3 for O? 
  C (4) -> we haven't tested position4 for C? 
  K (5) -> new letter? 

We get to test H, O in position3, C in position4, and K? 

But we know O is present? So if we put O in position3, and if it's correct? Then we get a ✓? Or if not? Then we know O is not in position3? Similarly for C in position4? 

But we also test H and K? 

Alternatively, we can try to test more new letters? 

Another candidate: ""sculp"": S, C, U, L, P -> but L is forbidden? Skip.

""scudo"": S, C, U, D, O -> but C is in position2? Not allowed? 

""scrod"": S, C, R, O, D -> C in position2? Not allowed? 

""crowd"": doesn't start with S.

How about ""sword"": S, W, O, R, D -> but we don't have C? We must include C? 

So we must have C? 

Another idea: ""scoop"": S, C, O, O, P -> but C is in position2? Not allowed? 

Unless we can put C in a different position? But in ""scoop"", C is fixed in position2? 

So we cannot use words that have C in position2? 

Therefore, we are left with words that have C in position3,4, or5? And O in position2,3, or5? But not position4? 

And we have to avoid the forbidden letters? 

Let me list more words:

- ""bocce"": not starting with S? 
- ""focus"": not starting with S? 
- ""jocks"": not starting with S? 
- ""yocks"": not starting with S? 

We need S at the start? 

So: 
  Position1: S
  Position2: cannot be C? And we can put O? Or other letters? 
  Then position3: can be O? Or C? Or other? 
  Position4: can be C? But not O? 
  Position5: can be O? Or C? 

So let's try:

  S _ O _ C -> but then O is in position3? And C in position5? 
  Example: ""shooc""? Not a word? 
  ""snooc""? Not a word? 

  S _ C _ O -> then C in position3? And O in position5? 
  Example: ""shuco""? Not a word? 
  ""sicko"": S I C K O -> but I is forbidden? Skip.
  ""sucky"": S U C K Y -> U, C, K, Y? But we don't have O? We must have O? 

  S O _ C _ -> O in position2? C in position4? 
  Example: ""sodcy""? Not a word? 
  ""sowce""? Not a word? 
  ""sorcs""? S O R C S -> but R and S? And we have S at the end? 
      But we know S is at the start? But if the word has another S? We don't know? 
      ""sorcs"" is not a word? 

  S O C _ _ -> but C in position3? But we cannot put C in position3? No, we can? Because C can be in position3? 
      But then we have to avoid O in position4? So the last two cannot be O? 
      Example: ""socle"" -> forbidden? 
      ""socko"": S O C K O -> O in position2 and 5? C in position3? 
          This is a word? (informal: socko meaning very successful? or a name? but we can use it? or find a better one? 
          But we have O in position5? And we know O is not in position4? So that's okay? 
          Also, K is new? 
          And we avoid forbidden letters? 

  S _ _ C O -> then C in position4? O in position5? 
      Example: ""shock"" is not? Because that has O in position3? 
      ""smock"" is S M O C K -> not this pattern? 
      ""spaco""? Not a word? 
      ""sirco""? Not a word? 

So the only common words we have are like ""shock"", ""smock"", and ""socko"". 

I think ""shock"" is a common word? So I'll go with ""shock"". 

But note: in ""shock"", we have:
  Position1: S (correct)
  Position2: H (new)
  Position3: O (we know O is present? So if it's in the correct position? We get ✓? Or if not? We get '-'? 
  Position4: C (we know C is present? So same? 
  Position5: K (new)

This will give us information about the positions of O and C? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O and C in positions we haven't tested? And also tests new letters? 

Another candidate: ""scudo"" -> but C in position2? Not allowed? 

""scow"": too short? 

""scowl"": L forbidden? 

""scour"": C in position2? Not allowed? 

""crops"": doesn't start with S? 

I think ""shock"" is a good choice? 

But let me check if there is a word with O in position5 and C in position3? 

For example: ""sulco""? Not a word? 

Or ""soc"" is too short? 

So I'll go with ""shock"". 

But wait, we have another candidate: ""smock"" is also good? 

""smock"": S, M, O, C, K -> same as shock? But with M instead of H? 

Both are valid? 

We can choose either? 

But we want to test more common letters? H is more common than M? 

In English, H is more frequent? 

So ""shock"" might be better? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a vowel? We have O? But we also have U? We haven't tested U? 

But in ""shock"", we don't test U? 

How about ""scout""? But T is forbidden? 

""sculp"": L forbidden? 

""scums"": S, C, U, M, S -> but C is in position2? Not allowed? 

""scups"": same? 

So I think ""shock"" is a good guess? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""shock"". 

But note: we are not sure if the word has H or K? But we are testing? 

So the guess is ""shock"". 

But let me double-check the feedback: 

In guess2, we had ""scion"" -> C was in position2 and got '-', meaning C is present but not in position2? So we avoid position2 for C? 

In ""shock"", C is in position4? So that's okay? 

O is in position3? And we know O is present? But we don't know if it's in position3? So we test? 

Also, we avoid all forbidden letters? 

So I think it's valid? 

<guess>shock</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""slate"" → S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)**  
  - **S** is correct and in position 1 (secret word starts with **S**).  
  - **L, A, T, E** are absent (cannot appear anywhere).  

- **Guess 2: ""scion"" → S(✓) C(-) I(x) O(-) N(x)**  
  - **S** is correct and in position 1 (confirmed).  
  - **C** is present but not in position 2 (must be in position 3, 4, or 5).  
  - **I** and **N** are absent (cannot appear anywhere).  
  - **O** is present but not in position 4 (must be in position 2, 3, or 5).  

### Key Constraints:
- **Position 1**: Must be **S**.  
- **Must include**: **C** and **O** (since they are present).  
  - **C** cannot be in position 2.  
  - **O** cannot be in position 4.  
- **Absent letters**: L, A, T, E, I, N (cannot use these).  
- **Untested letters**: Many consonants remain (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, R, U, W, Y).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Prioritize testing positions for C and O**:  
  - **C** must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
  - **O** must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
- **Maximize new information**: Use common letters not yet tested (e.g., H, K, M, P) to cover more ground.  
- **Avoid risky duplicates**: No evidence of duplicate letters yet, so prioritize distinct letters.  
- **Strong candidate words**:  
  - **""shock"" (S, H, O, C, K)**:  
    - Tests **O** in position 3 and **C** in position 4 (both valid per constraints).  
    - Uses new common letters **H** and **K**.  
    - Avoids all forbidden letters.  
  - Other options (e.g., ""smock"") were considered, but **""shock""** is preferred due to higher frequency of **H** vs. **M**.  

### Why ""shock""?
- Tests **O** in position 3 and **C** in position 4, which could confirm/deny their exact locations.  
- Introduces **H** (position 2) and **K** (position 5), both high-frequency consonants.  
- Fits all constraints and avoids wasted letters.",Guess 3: shock -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) O(✓) C(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
