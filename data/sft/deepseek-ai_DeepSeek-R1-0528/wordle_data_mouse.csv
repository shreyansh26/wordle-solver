We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We received feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
 This means:
  - E is in the secret word and in the correct position (the 5th letter).
  - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Since E is at the 5th position and is correct, we know the secret word ends with E.

 Also, since C, R, A, N are not in the word, we must avoid these letters in our next guess.

 We now know the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E

 For the next guess, we should use a word that:
  1. Ends with E (so we can get more information about the other positions? Actually, we already know the last letter is E, but we can use it to test other letters.)
  2. Uses other common letters that are not C, R, A, N.

 We can consider common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: The feedback told us that E is present and in the correct last position. However, our next guess doesn't necessarily have to put E in the last position? 
 However, it must be a valid word. Since we know E is in the last position, it's efficient to try words that end with E to confirm and also test other letters.

 But wait: the feedback doesn't prevent E from appearing in other positions? Actually, we don't know. The feedback only tells us that the last letter is E, but it might have another E? 
 However, the feedback for the first guess showed that only the last E was correct. The word ""crane"" had E only at the end, so we don't know about other E's.

 But note: if there were another E in the word, in the first guess, we would have seen an E marked with '-' in the wrong position? However, since E was the last letter and we got a check, that doesn't tell us about other occurrences.

 Let me clarify: the secret word could have more than one E? For example, the word could be ""ELOPE"". But wait, our feedback for ""crane"" would have been:
   If secret word is ""ELOPE"": 
        C (not in) -> x
        R (in secret? No -> x)
        A (in secret? No -> x)
        N (not in) -> x
        E (in secret and at correct position) -> ✓

 So we don't have information about other E's? Actually, the feedback doesn't show multiple occurrences? 
 How does the game handle duplicate letters? The rules did not specify. But typically, if you guess a word with two E's and the secret has only one E, then one E will be marked as in the word (if it's in the word) and the other will be marked as not present? 

 But in our case, we have no information about whether E appears elsewhere because we only had one E in the guess.

 Therefore, for our next guess, we should:
  - Avoid C, R, A, N.
  - The word must end with E? Not necessarily, but if we try a word that doesn't have E at the end, then we might get feedback for E at other positions? 
    However, we already know that the word ends with E. So if we put E at the last position again, we can focus on guessing the first four letters.

 It is better to use a word that has E in the last position again because we know that position is fixed. Then we can concentrate on the other four letters.

 Let me think of common words ending in E that use common remaining letters.

 Common letters that we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, Y, etc.

 Example words: 
  - SOLE: but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letter words.
  - STYLE? But has S,T,Y,L,E -> note E is at the end.

 We must form a valid 5-letter word.

 Some words: 
   ""STYLE"": S,T,Y,L,E
   ""TABLE"": but T and A? Wait, A is already excluded? We cannot use A because we know A is not in the secret word. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, N.

 So ""TABLE"" is invalid because it contains A, which we know is not in the word.

 Let's try to form words ending in E without C,R,A,N.

 Possible words: 
   ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E
   ""STYLE"" -> S,T,Y,L,E
   ""PHONE"" -> P,H,O,N,E -> but N is excluded? We know N is not in the word? So we cannot use N? Yes.

 How about ""SLIME"" -> S,L,I,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N and uses new letters.

 Another: ""SHINE"" -> S,H,I,N,E -> contains N? Yes, we cannot use N.

 Another: ""SPIKE"" -> S,P,I,K,E -> avoids forbidden letters.

 Also, ""SOLE"" isn't 5 letters, but ""SOLVE"" -> S,O,L,V,E -> avoids forbidden letters.

 Another: ""BIOME"" -> B,I,O,M,E -> avoids forbidden.

 But note: we want to maximize information by using a lot of common consonants and vowels.

 The letters S and T are very common. Also L, I, O are good.

 Let me pick ""SPIKE"" because it includes S, P, I, K, E? But E already we know, so we are testing S, P, I, K.

 However, note that ""SPIKE"" has I as the third letter and K as the fourth.

 Another good candidate: ""SLIDE"" is invalid because D? Wait, we haven't tested D, but also L,I,D,E -> and E at the end. But note: ""SLIDE"" avoids C,R,A,N.

 Actually, ""SLIDE"" has D which is common? But we don't know. Also, it uses S and L.

 Alternatively, ""SHIRE"": but H,I,R,E -> wait, R is excluded? We know R is not in the word? So we cannot use R.

 Yes, R is excluded. So we cannot use R.

 Therefore, we must avoid: C, R, A, N.

 So any word without these letters.

 Let me list common words ending in E without these letters: 
   ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E
   ""STYLE"": S,T,Y,L,E
   ""SLIME"": S,L,I,M,E
   ""PHONE"": invalid because of N
   ""SPIKE"": S,P,I,K,E
   ""BLUES"": but that has E at the fourth? Actually we need E at the fifth? So we need words ending in E.

 Also: ""QUOTE"": Q,U,O,T,E -> uses Q and U which are less common. Avoid?
   We want to test letters that are more likely to be in the word.

 Common consonants left: S, T, L, M, P, D, G, H, K, etc.

 So ""STOLE"" seems good: letters S, T, O, L.

 But what about vowels? We haven't tested O or I? 

 Also, we know E is already in the word and at the end, but what about other vowels? We don't know.

 Another option: using a word that might have an E in the middle? But wait: we know the last letter is fixed, but we might test for E at other positions? 
   However, if we don't put E at the end, then we won't get the feedback that the last letter is E? Actually, the feedback symbol for the last letter might change?

 But we know the secret word has E at the last position. So if we put E at the end again, we will get a check for the last letter, and then we can focus on the rest.

 Alternatively, if we put E somewhere else, then the last letter of our guess might be wrong? And we would get an 'x' for the last position? But that doesn't help because we already know the last position is E? 
   Actually, we don't want to deviate from the known letter because that would waste a letter slot.

 Strategy: keep the 5th letter fixed as E and guess for the first four.

 Therefore, we guess a word of the form _ _ _ _ E.

 Now, the word must be without C, R, A, N, and use letters that are common.

 Consider: ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E
 Consider: ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E
 Consider: ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E

 Among these, ""STOLE"" uses T and O which are very common. 

 Also, ""STOLE"" has the T and S which are commonly at the beginning or in the first few letters.

 I'll go with ""STOLE"" because it uses S, T, O, L which are common letters we haven't tried.

 So the guess is ""STOLE"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- **E(✓)** indicates that the secret word ends with ""E"" (this position is now known).  
- **C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x)** mean these letters are **absent** from the secret word, so they must be avoided.  

The next guess should:  
1. End with **E** (to preserve the known correct position).  
2. Exclude **C, R, A, N**.  
3. Prioritize common unused letters like **S, T, L, O, P** to maximize information.  

A strong candidate is **""stole""**:  
- Ends with **E** (aligns with known position).  
- Uses new common consonants (**S, T, L**) and vowel (**O**).

 However, the feedback for the first guess showed that only the last E was correct. The word ""crane"" had E only at the end, so we don't know about other E's.

 But note: if there were another E in the word, in the first guess, we would have seen an E marked with '-' in the wrong position? However, since E was the last letter and we got a check, that doesn't tell us about other occurrences.

 Let me clarify: the secret word could have more than one E? For example, the word could be ""ELOPE"". But wait, our feedback for ""crane"" would have been:
   If secret word is ""ELOPE"": 
        C (not in) -> x
        R (in secret? No -> x)
        A (in secret? No -> x)
        N (not in) -> x
        E (in secret and at correct position) -> ✓

 So we don't have information about other E's? Actually, the feedback doesn't show multiple occurrences? 
 How does the game handle duplicate letters? The rules did not specify. But typically, if you guess a word with two E's and the secret has only one E, then one E will be marked as in the word (if it's in the word) and the other will be marked as not present? 

 But in our case, we have no information about whether E appears elsewhere because we only had one E in the guess.

 Therefore, for our next guess, we should:
  - Avoid C, R, A, N.
  - The word must end with E? Not necessarily, but if we try a word that doesn't have E at the end, then we might get feedback for E at other positions? 
    However, we already know that the word ends with E. So if we put E at the last position again, we can focus on guessing the first four letters.

 It is better to use a word that has E in the last position again because we know that position is fixed. Then we can concentrate on the other four letters.

 Let me think of common words ending in E that use common remaining letters.

 Common letters that we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, Y, etc.

 Example words: 
  - SOLE: but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letter words.
  - STYLE? But has S,T,Y,L,E -> note E is at the end.

 We must form a valid 5-letter word.

 Some words: 
   ""STYLE"": S,T,Y,L,E
   ""TABLE"": but T and A? Wait, A is already excluded? We cannot use A because we know A is not in the secret word. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, N.

 So ""TABLE"" is invalid because it contains A, which we know is not in the word.

 Let's try to form words ending in E without C,R,A,N.

 Possible words: 
   ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E
   ""STYLE"" -> S,T,Y,L,E
   ""PHONE"" -> P,H,O,N,E -> but N is excluded? We know N is not in the word? So we cannot use N? Yes.

 How about ""SLIME"" -> S,L,I,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N and uses new letters.

 Another: ""SHINE"" -> S,H,I,N,E -> contains N? Yes, we cannot use N.

 Another: ""SPIKE"" -> S,P,I,K,E -> avoids forbidden letters.

 Also, ""SOLE"" isn't 5 letters, but ""SOLVE"" -> S,O,L,V,E -> avoids forbidden letters.

 Another: ""BIOME"" -> B,I,O,M,E -> avoids forbidden.

 But note: we want to maximize information by using a lot of common consonants and vowels.

 The letters S and T are very common. Also L, I, O are good.

 Let me pick ""SPIKE"" because it includes S, P, I, K, E? But E already we know, so we are testing S, P, I, K.

 However, note that ""SPIKE"" has I as the third letter and K as the fourth.

 Another good candidate: ""SLIDE"" is invalid because D? Wait, we haven't tested D, but also L,I,D,E -> and E at the end. But note: ""SLIDE"" avoids C,R,A,N.

 Actually, ""SLIDE"" has D which is common? But we don't know. Also, it uses S and L.

 Alternatively, ""SHIRE"": but H,I,R,E -> wait, R is excluded? We know R is not in the word? So we cannot use R.

 Yes, R is excluded. So we cannot use R.

 Therefore, we must avoid: C, R, A, N.

 So any word without these letters.

 Let me list common words ending in E without these letters: 
   ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E
   ""STYLE"": S,T,Y,L,E
   ""SLIME"": S,L,I,M,E
   ""PHONE"": invalid because of N
   ""SPIKE"": S,P,I,K,E
   ""BLUES"": but that has E at the fourth? Actually we need E at the fifth? So we need words ending in E.

 Also: ""QUOTE"": Q,U,O,T,E -> uses Q and U which are less common. Avoid?
   We want to test letters that are more likely to be in the word.

 Common consonants left: S, T, L, M, P, D, G, H, K, etc.

 So ""STOLE"" seems good: letters S, T, O, L.

 But what about vowels? We haven't tested O or I? 

 Also, we know E is already in the word and at the end, but what about other vowels? We don't know.

 Another option: using a word that might have an E in the middle? But wait: we know the last letter is fixed, but we might test for E at other positions? 
   However, if we don't put E at the end, then we won't get the feedback that the last letter is E? Actually, the feedback symbol for the last letter might change?

 But we know the secret word has E at the last position. So if we put E at the end again, we will get a check for the last letter, and then we can focus on the rest.

 Alternatively, if we put E somewhere else, then the last letter of our guess might be wrong? And we would get an 'x' for the last position? But that doesn't help because we already know the last position is E? 
   Actually, we don't want to deviate from the known letter because that would waste a letter slot.

 Strategy: keep the 5th letter fixed as E and guess for the first four.

 Therefore, we guess a word of the form _ _ _ _ E.

 Now, the word must be without C, R, A, N, and use letters that are common.

 Consider: ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E
 Consider: ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E
 Consider: ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E

 Among these, ""STOLE"" uses T and O which are very common. 

 Also, ""STOLE"" has the T and S which are commonly at the beginning or in the first few letters.

 I'll go with ""STOLE"" because it uses S, T, O, L which are common letters we haven't tried.

 So the guess is ""STOLE"".

<guess>stole</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- **E(✓)** indicates that the secret word ends with ""E"" (this position is now known).  
- **C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x)** mean these letters are **absent** from the secret word, so they must be avoided.  

The next guess should:  
1. End with **E** (to preserve the known correct position).  
2. Exclude **C, R, A, N**.  
3. Prioritize common unused letters like **S, T, L, O, P** to maximize information.  

A strong candidate is **""stole""**:  
- Ends with **E** (aligns with known position).  
- Uses new common consonants (**S, T, L**) and vowel (**O**).  
- Avoids excluded letters (**C, R, A, N**).  

This probe efficiently tests high-frequency letters while leveraging confirmed information.

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   - C: absent (x)
   - R: absent (x)
   - A: absent (x)
   - N: absent (x)
   - E: correct (✓) at position 5

2. ""stole"":
   - S: present but wrong position (-)
   - T: absent (x)
   - O: present but wrong position (-)
   - L: absent (x)
   - E: correct (✓) at position 5

From this, we know:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5 is fixed).
- The letters C, R, A, N, T, L are absent. So we must avoid: C, R, A, N, T, L.
- The letters S and O are present in the word, but not in the positions we guessed:
   - In ""stole"", S was at position 1 and O at position 3. So S is not at position 1, and O is not at position 3.

Also, note that E is already fixed at position 5, and we know it's there. However, there might be another E? But we don't have information about that.

Now, the secret word has:
- S and O somewhere, but not at position 1 and not at position 3 (from the second guess). Also, since the word ends with E, the positions for S and O must be among 1,2,3,4? But position 5 is E, so positions 1,2,3,4 are open for S and O, but we know S is not at 1 and O is not at 3.

Moreover, we have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N, T, L.

So available letters: We have used: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O,L (but E, S, O are present; C,R,A,N,T,L are absent). So we can use any letters except: C,R,A,N,T,L.

But note: we have two present letters: S and O. So the secret word contains at least S and O (and E, which we already know).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains S and O (but not at position 1 for S, and not at position 3 for O)
- Does not contain C,R,A,N,T,L

Also, we have two more letters to guess? The word has 5 letters: we know E at 5, and we know S and O are in the word, so the other two letters must be from the remaining available letters.

Available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tested: 
We have tested: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O,L (and T and L are absent, so avoid them).

So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know the word has S and O, so we must include them.

Now, for the next guess, we should try to place S and O in positions that are allowed (S not at 1, O not at 3) and also test new letters.

We have two positions to fill (besides the positions for S and O and the fixed E). Actually, the word has 5 positions. We know position 5 is E. We need to assign S and O to two of the first four positions, but with constraints: S cannot be at position 1, and O cannot be at position 3.

Possible positions for S: 2,3,4
Possible positions for O: 1,2,4 (since not 3)

But note: we don't know if S and O can be in the same word? They can, as long as the word exists.

We also need to choose two more letters from the available set.

We should choose common letters to maximize information.

Let me think of words that end with E, contain S and O, avoid C,R,A,N,T,L, and have S not at 1 and O not at 3.

Example: 
  ""POSSE"" -> but has S at position 4 and 5? But position 5 is E, so not. Also, O is at position 1? But we don't have constraint against O at 1? Actually, O can be at 1. But ""POSSE"" has two S's? And the last letter is E? ""POSSE"" is P-O-S-S-E. So:
  - Position 1: P (we don't know)
  - Position 2: O -> but in our feedback, O was present but not at position 3, so it can be at 2? Yes.
  - Position 3: S -> but we have constraint that S cannot be at position 1? It can be at 3? Yes, because in the second guess S was at 1 and was wrong, but it can be at 3? Actually, the feedback for ""stole"" only said S is not at 1, but it could be at 3 or 4. Similarly, O is not at 3, but it can be at 1,2,4.

But ""POSSE"" has two S's? And the last letter is E? Actually, ""POSSE"" is 5 letters: P-O-S-S-E. So it ends with E, and has O and S. But we have two S's? We don't know if the secret word has two S's? It might.

But we also have to avoid T and L? ""POSSE"" doesn't have T or L, so it's okay.

But let's check the feedback we would get if we guess ""POSSE""? We are not actually guessing it, but we need to see if it fits the constraints.

Alternatively, we can try to think of other words.

Another word: ""HOUSE"" -> H-O-U-S-E. 
  - Ends with E.
  - Contains O and S.
  - O is at position 2? Then S at position 4? 
  - Avoids C,R,A,N,T,L? H, O, U, S, E -> no T, no L, so okay.

But we haven't tested H and U.

Another: ""MOUSE"" -> M-O-U-S-E, same as above.

But we don't know if H or M or U are in the word.

We could also try a word that puts S and O in different positions and tests new common letters.

We know S is not at 1, so we can put S at 2,3, or 4.
We know O is not at 3, so we can put O at 1,2, or 4.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me list possible words:

Option 1: O at position 1, S at position 4: e.g., ""O__S_E"" -> but the last is E, so ""O__SE"". What words? Like ""OPUSE""? Not common. ""OUNCE"" but has N and C? Excluded. 

Option 2: O at position 2, S at position 3: ""O"" at 2 and ""S"" at 3: word pattern: _ O S _ E. Words: ""DOSE"" is 4 letters. ""DOSSE"" not a word. ""MOSSE"" not common? ""POSSE"" has S at 3 and 4? Not exactly. ""POSSE"" is P-O-S-S-E, so S at 3 and 4? Then O is at 2? So pattern: _ O S S E.

But we can have ""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> O at 2, S at 4.

Another: ""MOUSE"": same.

Option 3: O at position 2, S at position 4: that's ""HOUSE"".

Option 4: O at position 4, S at position 2: pattern: _ S _ O E. Words: ""ISSUE"" but has I and S at 2? ""ISSUE"" is I-S-S-U-E -> S at 2 and 3? Not exactly. We need S at 2 and O at 4? So pattern: _ S _ O E. Example: ""SCOPE"" but has C? Excluded. ""STOKE"" has T? Excluded. ""SHOES"" is S-H-O-E-S -> but ends with S, not E? We need E at the end.

Actually, ""SHOE"" is 4 letters. 

What about ""SMOKE""? But has K? And O at 3? But we are trying O at 4? Not.

It's hard to find a word with S at 2 and O at 4? 

Alternatively, O at 1 and S at 3: pattern: O _ S _ E. Words: ""OPSIS"" not ending with E? ""OUNCE"" excluded. ""OZONE"" has Z and O at 1 and 3? O-Z-O-N-E -> but O at 1 and 3? And N excluded. Not.

O at 1 and S at 4: pattern: O _ _ S E. Words: ""OASES"" is O-A-S-E-S -> but A excluded, and ends with S? Not E. ""OPSET"" not a word? ""OBIES"" not common.

So the most common words are like ""HOUSE"", ""MOUSE"", ""POISE"" (but ""POISE"" is P-O-I-S-E, so O at 2 and S at 4? Actually, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4? Then E at 5. And P at 1.

But ""POISE"" uses P, O, I, S, E. Avoids the excluded letters? C,R,A,N,T,L? Yes.

Similarly, ""NOISE"" has N? Excluded.

""MOISE"" not a word.

""HOISE"" not common.

So ""POISE"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""BOUSE"" not common.

We also have ""VOICE"" but has C? Excluded.

So let's consider ""POISE"" and ""HOUSE"".

But we also have the feedback that in the second guess, O was at position 3 and was wrong? But in ""POISE"", O is at position 2? That's allowed. And S is at position 4? In the second guess, S was at position 1 and was wrong, so S at 4 is allowed.

Similarly, for ""HOUSE"": O at 2, S at 4.

But we don't know if P or H or I (in ""POISE"") are in the word.

We need to choose a word that tests new letters.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: H, I, M, P, U, etc.

We can choose ""POISE"" to test P, O, I, S, E. But O and S we already know are present, so we are testing P and I.

Similarly, ""HOUSE"" tests H, O, U, S, E -> tests H and U.

But note: we have two present letters (S and O) that we must include, so we are forced to include them. The other two letters we choose should be new.

We can also consider a word that puts S and O in positions that we haven't tried and that are more informative.

For example, we know S is not at 1, so we can try S at position 2 or 3 or 4. Similarly for O.

In the second guess, we tried O at position 3 and it was wrong? Actually, in ""stole"", O was at position 3 and we got a minus, meaning it is in the word but not at 3. So we can try O at position 2 or 4.

Similarly, S was at 1 and wrong, so we can try S at 2,3,4.

To get more information, we might try S at a position we haven't tried, like 2 or 4? We tried 1 and it was wrong, so we avoid 1.

Similarly, O we tried at 3 and it was wrong, so avoid 3.

So let's try to put S at position 2 and O at position 4? But we couldn't find a common word for that.

Alternatively, S at position 3 and O at position 2? That would be pattern: _ O S _ E. Words: ""DOSE"" is 4 letters. ""DOSED"" is 5 but ends with D? Not E. ""POSER"" not ends with E. ""POSSE"" is P-O-S-S-E, so S at 3 and 4? Then O at 2? So that's a pattern: _ O S S E. But we don't know if there are two S's.

Another word: ""GOOSE"" has O at 2 and 3? And ends with E? G-O-O-S-E -> O at 2 and 3? But we have constraint that O cannot be at 3? Because in ""stole"", O at 3 was wrong? So if we put O at 3 again, it would be wrong? But we know it's not at 3, so we shouldn't put it at 3.

So we must avoid putting O at position 3 and S at position 1.

Therefore, for ""POSSE"", if we put O at 2 and S at 3 and 4? But O at 2 is allowed, and S at 3 is allowed? But we don't know if S can be at 3? We haven't tried S at 3.

But the word ""POSSE"" has two S's? We don't know if the secret word has two S's.

Alternatively, we can try ""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> positions: O at 2, S at 4. Both allowed.

Similarly, ""POISE"": P-O-I-S-E -> O at 2, S at 4.

I think ""HOUSE"" and ""POISE"" are both good.

But let's see which one tests more common letters. ""HOUSE"" has H and U, ""POISE"" has P and I.

H and P are both common, I and U are vowels.

We can choose one.

Another idea: we know that in the secret word, the letter at position 1 is not S (from second guess) and not C,R,A,N,T,L. So it must be one of the available letters.

We can try to use a word that has a common letter at position 1, and then O and S in allowed positions.

For example, with ""HOUSE"": H at 1, O at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

This tests H at 1, O at 2 (which is allowed for O? Yes, O can be at 2), U at 3, S at 4.

But we have a constraint that O cannot be at 3? But we are putting O at 2, which is fine. And S at 4 is fine.

Similarly, ""POISE"": P at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

This tests P at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4.

But note: in the second guess, we don't have information about position 3 for S? We only know S is not at 1. So S at 3 is possible? But in ""POISE"", S is at 4, not 3.

Also, for O, we are putting it at 2, which is allowed.

I think both are valid.

But let's consider the feedback we might get.

We might also consider ""MOUSE"": M at 1, O at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

I think I'll go with ""HOUSE"" because H is a common starting letter.

So guess: ""HOUSE""

But let's double-check the feedback we have: in the first guess, we had no H, so we don't know about H.

Similarly, in the second guess, no H.

So it's a new letter.

But note: we have to avoid T and L? Yes, and HOUSE has no T or L.

So I'll go with ""HOUSE"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""HOUSE"" is a valid word.

So next guess: ""HOUSE""

But let's see if there's a better word that tests more vowels? We haven't tested I or U? ""HOUSE"" tests U, which is a vowel.

Alternatively, ""POISE"" tests I.

But I think both are fine.

We can also consider ""SHOWY"" but doesn't end with E.

Another word: ""BIOME"" but has B,I,O,M,E -> but we need to include S? We know S is in the word, so we must include S. So we cannot use ""BIOME"" because it doesn't have S.

We must include S and O.

So ""HOUSE"" includes S and O.

Therefore, I choose ""HOUSE"".

</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → E is correct and in position 5. C, R, A, N are absent.
- **Guess 2: stole** → S and O are present but in the wrong positions (S not at 1, O not at 3). T and L are absent. E is confirmed at position 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed position**: The 5th letter is **E**.
- **Present letters**: **S** and **O** must appear in the word, but:
  - S cannot be at position 1 (from ""stole"" feedback).
  - O cannot be at position 3 (from ""stole"" feedback).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, T, L (must avoid these).
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, 3, and 4 need to be resolved, with S and O placed in valid positions (S: positions 2, 3, or 4; O: positions 1, 2, or 4).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters** (e.g., H, I, P, U) while including S and O in allowed positions.
- **End with E** to maintain the known position.
- **Avoid absent letters** (C, R, A, N, T, L).
- **Valid word structure**: S not at 1, O not at 3.

### Chosen Guess: ""HOUSE""
- **H**: New letter (common consonant, tests position 1).
- **O**: Position 2 (allowed, since O cannot be at 3).
- **U**: New letter (common vowel, tests position 3).
- **S**: Position 4 (allowed, since S cannot be at 1).
- **E**: Position 5 (confirmed).

This guess efficiently:
  - Tests S and O in new valid positions (O at 2, S at 4).
  - Probes two new common letters (H and U).
  - Avoids all excluded letters.

<guess>house</guess>",house,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   - C: absent (x)
   - R: absent (x)
   - A: absent (x)
   - N: absent (x)
   - E: correct (✓) at position 5

2. ""stole"":
   - S: present but wrong position (-)
   - T: absent (x)
   - O: present but wrong position (-)
   - L: absent (x)
   - E: correct (✓) at position 5

From this, we know:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5 is fixed).
- The letters C, R, A, N, T, L are absent. So we must avoid: C, R, A, N, T, L.
- The letters S and O are present in the word, but not in the positions we guessed:
   - In ""stole"", S was at position 1 and O at position 3. So S is not at position 1, and O is not at position 3.

Also, note that E is already fixed at position 5, and we know it's there. However, there might be another E? But we don't have information about that.

Now, the secret word has:
- S and O somewhere, but not at position 1 and not at position 3 (from the second guess). Also, since the word ends with E, the positions for S and O must be among 1,2,3,4? But position 5 is E, so positions 1,2,3,4 are open for S and O, but we know S is not at 1 and O is not at 3.

Moreover, we have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N, T, L.

So available letters: We have used: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O,L (but E, S, O are present; C,R,A,N,T,L are absent). So we can use any letters except: C,R,A,N,T,L.

But note: we have two present letters: S and O. So the secret word contains at least S and O (and E, which we already know).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains S and O (but not at position 1 for S, and not at position 3 for O)
- Does not contain C,R,A,N,T,L

Also, we have two more letters to guess? The word has 5 letters: we know E at 5, and we know S and O are in the word, so the other two letters must be from the remaining available letters.

Available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tested: 
We have tested: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O,L (and T and L are absent, so avoid them).

So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know the word has S and O, so we must include them.

Now, for the next guess, we should try to place S and O in positions that are allowed (S not at 1, O not at 3) and also test new letters.

We have two positions to fill (besides the positions for S and O and the fixed E). Actually, the word has 5 positions. We know position 5 is E. We need to assign S and O to two of the first four positions, but with constraints: S cannot be at position 1, and O cannot be at position 3.

Possible positions for S: 2,3,4
Possible positions for O: 1,2,4 (since not 3)

But note: we don't know if S and O can be in the same word? They can, as long as the word exists.

We also need to choose two more letters from the available set.

We should choose common letters to maximize information.

Let me think of words that end with E, contain S and O, avoid C,R,A,N,T,L, and have S not at 1 and O not at 3.

Example: 
  ""POSSE"" -> but has S at position 4 and 5? But position 5 is E, so not. Also, O is at position 1? But we don't have constraint against O at 1? Actually, O can be at 1. But ""POSSE"" has two S's? And the last letter is E? ""POSSE"" is P-O-S-S-E. So:
  - Position 1: P (we don't know)
  - Position 2: O -> but in our feedback, O was present but not at position 3, so it can be at 2? Yes.
  - Position 3: S -> but we have constraint that S cannot be at position 1? It can be at 3? Yes, because in the second guess S was at 1 and was wrong, but it can be at 3? Actually, the feedback for ""stole"" only said S is not at 1, but it could be at 3 or 4. Similarly, O is not at 3, but it can be at 1,2,4.

But ""POSSE"" has two S's? And the last letter is E? Actually, ""POSSE"" is 5 letters: P-O-S-S-E. So it ends with E, and has O and S. But we have two S's? We don't know if the secret word has two S's? It might.

But we also have to avoid T and L? ""POSSE"" doesn't have T or L, so it's okay.

But let's check the feedback we would get if we guess ""POSSE""? We are not actually guessing it, but we need to see if it fits the constraints.

Alternatively, we can try to think of other words.

Another word: ""HOUSE"" -> H-O-U-S-E. 
  - Ends with E.
  - Contains O and S.
  - O is at position 2? Then S at position 4? 
  - Avoids C,R,A,N,T,L? H, O, U, S, E -> no T, no L, so okay.

But we haven't tested H and U.

Another: ""MOUSE"" -> M-O-U-S-E, same as above.

But we don't know if H or M or U are in the word.

We could also try a word that puts S and O in different positions and tests new common letters.

We know S is not at 1, so we can put S at 2,3, or 4.
We know O is not at 3, so we can put O at 1,2, or 4.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me list possible words:

Option 1: O at position 1, S at position 4: e.g., ""O__S_E"" -> but the last is E, so ""O__SE"". What words? Like ""OPUSE""? Not common. ""OUNCE"" but has N and C? Excluded. 

Option 2: O at position 2, S at position 3: ""O"" at 2 and ""S"" at 3: word pattern: _ O S _ E. Words: ""DOSE"" is 4 letters. ""DOSSE"" not a word. ""MOSSE"" not common? ""POSSE"" has S at 3 and 4? Not exactly. ""POSSE"" is P-O-S-S-E, so S at 3 and 4? Then O is at 2? So pattern: _ O S S E.

But we can have ""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> O at 2, S at 4.

Another: ""MOUSE"": same.

Option 3: O at position 2, S at position 4: that's ""HOUSE"".

Option 4: O at position 4, S at position 2: pattern: _ S _ O E. Words: ""ISSUE"" but has I and S at 2? ""ISSUE"" is I-S-S-U-E -> S at 2 and 3? Not exactly. We need S at 2 and O at 4? So pattern: _ S _ O E. Example: ""SCOPE"" but has C? Excluded. ""STOKE"" has T? Excluded. ""SHOES"" is S-H-O-E-S -> but ends with S, not E? We need E at the end.

Actually, ""SHOE"" is 4 letters. 

What about ""SMOKE""? But has K? And O at 3? But we are trying O at 4? Not.

It's hard to find a word with S at 2 and O at 4? 

Alternatively, O at 1 and S at 3: pattern: O _ S _ E. Words: ""OPSIS"" not ending with E? ""OUNCE"" excluded. ""OZONE"" has Z and O at 1 and 3? O-Z-O-N-E -> but O at 1 and 3? And N excluded. Not.

O at 1 and S at 4: pattern: O _ _ S E. Words: ""OASES"" is O-A-S-E-S -> but A excluded, and ends with S? Not E. ""OPSET"" not a word? ""OBIES"" not common.

So the most common words are like ""HOUSE"", ""MOUSE"", ""POISE"" (but ""POISE"" is P-O-I-S-E, so O at 2 and S at 4? Actually, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4? Then E at 5. And P at 1.

But ""POISE"" uses P, O, I, S, E. Avoids the excluded letters? C,R,A,N,T,L? Yes.

Similarly, ""NOISE"" has N? Excluded.

""MOISE"" not a word.

""HOISE"" not common.

So ""POISE"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""BOUSE"" not common.

We also have ""VOICE"" but has C? Excluded.

So let's consider ""POISE"" and ""HOUSE"".

But we also have the feedback that in the second guess, O was at position 3 and was wrong? But in ""POISE"", O is at position 2? That's allowed. And S is at position 4? In the second guess, S was at position 1 and was wrong, so S at 4 is allowed.

Similarly, for ""HOUSE"": O at 2, S at 4.

But we don't know if P or H or I (in ""POISE"") are in the word.

We need to choose a word that tests new letters.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: H, I, M, P, U, etc.

We can choose ""POISE"" to test P, O, I, S, E. But O and S we already know are present, so we are testing P and I.

Similarly, ""HOUSE"" tests H, O, U, S, E -> tests H and U.

But note: we have two present letters (S and O) that we must include, so we are forced to include them. The other two letters we choose should be new.

We can also consider a word that puts S and O in positions that we haven't tried and that are more informative.

For example, we know S is not at 1, so we can try S at position 2 or 3 or 4. Similarly for O.

In the second guess, we tried O at position 3 and it was wrong? Actually, in ""stole"", O was at position 3 and we got a minus, meaning it is in the word but not at 3. So we can try O at position 2 or 4.

Similarly, S was at 1 and wrong, so we can try S at 2,3,4.

To get more information, we might try S at a position we haven't tried, like 2 or 4? We tried 1 and it was wrong, so we avoid 1.

Similarly, O we tried at 3 and it was wrong, so avoid 3.

So let's try to put S at position 2 and O at position 4? But we couldn't find a common word for that.

Alternatively, S at position 3 and O at position 2? That would be pattern: _ O S _ E. Words: ""DOSE"" is 4 letters. ""DOSED"" is 5 but ends with D? Not E. ""POSER"" not ends with E. ""POSSE"" is P-O-S-S-E, so S at 3 and 4? Then O at 2? So that's a pattern: _ O S S E. But we don't know if there are two S's.

Another word: ""GOOSE"" has O at 2 and 3? And ends with E? G-O-O-S-E -> O at 2 and 3? But we have constraint that O cannot be at 3? Because in ""stole"", O at 3 was wrong? So if we put O at 3 again, it would be wrong? But we know it's not at 3, so we shouldn't put it at 3.

So we must avoid putting O at position 3 and S at position 1.

Therefore, for ""POSSE"", if we put O at 2 and S at 3 and 4? But O at 2 is allowed, and S at 3 is allowed? But we don't know if S can be at 3? We haven't tried S at 3.

But the word ""POSSE"" has two S's? We don't know if the secret word has two S's.

Alternatively, we can try ""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> positions: O at 2, S at 4. Both allowed.

Similarly, ""POISE"": P-O-I-S-E -> O at 2, S at 4.

I think ""HOUSE"" and ""POISE"" are both good.

But let's see which one tests more common letters. ""HOUSE"" has H and U, ""POISE"" has P and I.

H and P are both common, I and U are vowels.

We can choose one.

Another idea: we know that in the secret word, the letter at position 1 is not S (from second guess) and not C,R,A,N,T,L. So it must be one of the available letters.

We can try to use a word that has a common letter at position 1, and then O and S in allowed positions.

For example, with ""HOUSE"": H at 1, O at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

This tests H at 1, O at 2 (which is allowed for O? Yes, O can be at 2), U at 3, S at 4.

But we have a constraint that O cannot be at 3? But we are putting O at 2, which is fine. And S at 4 is fine.

Similarly, ""POISE"": P at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

This tests P at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4.

But note: in the second guess, we don't have information about position 3 for S? We only know S is not at 1. So S at 3 is possible? But in ""POISE"", S is at 4, not 3.

Also, for O, we are putting it at 2, which is allowed.

I think both are valid.

But let's consider the feedback we might get.

We might also consider ""MOUSE"": M at 1, O at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

I think I'll go with ""HOUSE"" because H is a common starting letter.

So guess: ""HOUSE""

But let's double-check the feedback we have: in the first guess, we had no H, so we don't know about H.

Similarly, in the second guess, no H.

So it's a new letter.

But note: we have to avoid T and L? Yes, and HOUSE has no T or L.

So I'll go with ""HOUSE"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""HOUSE"" is a valid word.

So next guess: ""HOUSE""

But let's see if there's a better word that tests more vowels? We haven't tested I or U? ""HOUSE"" tests U, which is a vowel.

Alternatively, ""POISE"" tests I.

But I think both are fine.

We can also consider ""SHOWY"" but doesn't end with E.

Another word: ""BIOME"" but has B,I,O,M,E -> but we need to include S? We know S is in the word, so we must include S. So we cannot use ""BIOME"" because it doesn't have S.

We must include S and O.

So ""HOUSE"" includes S and O.

Therefore, I choose ""HOUSE"".

<guess>house</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → E is correct and in position 5. C, R, A, N are absent.
- **Guess 2: stole** → S and O are present but in the wrong positions (S not at 1, O not at 3). T and L are absent. E is confirmed at position 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed position**: The 5th letter is **E**.
- **Present letters**: **S** and **O** must appear in the word, but:
  - S cannot be at position 1 (from ""stole"" feedback).
  - O cannot be at position 3 (from ""stole"" feedback).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, T, L (must avoid these).
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, 3, and 4 need to be resolved, with S and O placed in valid positions (S: positions 2, 3, or 4; O: positions 1, 2, or 4).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters** (e.g., H, I, P, U) while including S and O in allowed positions.
- **End with E** to maintain the known position.
- **Avoid absent letters** (C, R, A, N, T, L).
- **Valid word structure**: S not at 1, O not at 3.

### Chosen Guess: ""HOUSE""
- **H**: New letter (common consonant, tests position 1).
- **O**: Position 2 (allowed, since O cannot be at 3).
- **U**: New letter (common vowel, tests position 3).
- **S**: Position 4 (allowed, since S cannot be at 1).
- **E**: Position 5 (confirmed).

This guess efficiently:
  - Tests S and O in new valid positions (O at 2, S at 4).
  - Probes two new common letters (H and U).
  - Avoids all excluded letters.",Guess 3: house -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) U(✓) S(✓) E(✓),FAIL

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We received feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
 This means:
  - E is in the secret word and in the correct position (the 5th letter).
  - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Since E is at the 5th position and is correct, we know the secret word ends with E.

 Also, since C, R, A, N are not in the word, we must avoid these letters in our next guess.

 We now know the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E

 For the next guess, we should use a word that:
  1. Ends with E (so we can get more information about the other positions? Actually, we already know the last letter is E, but we can use it to test other letters.)
  2. Uses other common letters that are not C, R, A, N.

 We can consider common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: The feedback told us that E is present and in the correct last position. However, our next guess doesn't necessarily have to put E in the last position? 
 However, it must be a valid word. Since we know E is in the last position, it's efficient to try words that end with E to confirm and also test other letters.

 But wait: the feedback doesn't prevent E from appearing in other positions? Actually, we don't know. The feedback only tells us that the last letter is E, but it might have another E? 
 However, the feedback for the first guess showed that only the last E was correct. The word ""crane"" had E only at the end, so we don't know about other E's.

 But note: if there were another E in the word, in the first guess, we would have seen an E marked with '-' in the wrong position? However, since E was the last letter and we got a check, that doesn't tell us about other occurrences.

 Let me clarify: the secret word could have more than one E? For example, the word could be ""ELOPE"". But wait, our feedback for ""crane"" would have been:
   If secret word is ""ELOPE"": 
        C (not in) -> x
        R (in secret? No -> x)
        A (in secret? No -> x)
        N (not in) -> x
        E (in secret and at correct position) -> ✓

 So we don't have information about other E's? Actually, the feedback doesn't show multiple occurrences? 
 How does the game handle duplicate letters? The rules did not specify. But typically, if you guess a word with two E's and the secret has only one E, then one E will be marked as in the word (if it's in the word) and the other will be marked as not present? 

 But in our case, we have no information about whether E appears elsewhere because we only had one E in the guess.

 Therefore, for our next guess, we should:
  - Avoid C, R, A, N.
  - The word must end with E? Not necessarily, but if we try a word that doesn't have E at the end, then we might get feedback for E at other positions? 
    However, we already know that the word ends with E. So if we put E at the last position again, we can focus on guessing the first four letters.

 It is better to use a word that has E in the last position again because we know that position is fixed. Then we can concentrate on the other four letters.

 Let me think of common words ending in E that use common remaining letters.

 Common letters that we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, Y, etc.

 Example words: 
  - SOLE: but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letter words.
  - STYLE? But has S,T,Y,L,E -> note E is at the end.

 We must form a valid 5-letter word.

 Some words: 
   ""STYLE"": S,T,Y,L,E
   ""TABLE"": but T and A? Wait, A is already excluded? We cannot use A because we know A is not in the secret word. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, N.

 So ""TABLE"" is invalid because it contains A, which we know is not in the word.

 Let's try to form words ending in E without C,R,A,N.

 Possible words: 
   ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E
   ""STYLE"" -> S,T,Y,L,E
   ""PHONE"" -> P,H,O,N,E -> but N is excluded? We know N is not in the word? So we cannot use N? Yes.

 How about ""SLIME"" -> S,L,I,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N and uses new letters.

 Another: ""SHINE"" -> S,H,I,N,E -> contains N? Yes, we cannot use N.

 Another: ""SPIKE"" -> S,P,I,K,E -> avoids forbidden letters.

 Also, ""SOLE"" isn't 5 letters, but ""SOLVE"" -> S,O,L,V,E -> avoids forbidden letters.

 Another: ""BIOME"" -> B,I,O,M,E -> avoids forbidden.

 But note: we want to maximize information by using a lot of common consonants and vowels.

 The letters S and T are very common. Also L, I, O are good.

 Let me pick ""SPIKE"" because it includes S, P, I, K, E? But E already we know, so we are testing S, P, I, K.

 However, note that ""SPIKE"" has I as the third letter and K as the fourth.

 Another good candidate: ""SLIDE"" is invalid because D? Wait, we haven't tested D, but also L,I,D,E -> and E at the end. But note: ""SLIDE"" avoids C,R,A,N.

 Actually, ""SLIDE"" has D which is common? But we don't know. Also, it uses S and L.

 Alternatively, ""SHIRE"": but H,I,R,E -> wait, R is excluded? We know R is not in the word? So we cannot use R.

 Yes, R is excluded. So we cannot use R.

 Therefore, we must avoid: C, R, A, N.

 So any word without these letters.

 Let me list common words ending in E without these letters: 
   ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E
   ""STYLE"": S,T,Y,L,E
   ""SLIME"": S,L,I,M,E
   ""PHONE"": invalid because of N
   ""SPIKE"": S,P,I,K,E
   ""BLUES"": but that has E at the fourth? Actually we need E at the fifth? So we need words ending in E.

 Also: ""QUOTE"": Q,U,O,T,E -> uses Q and U which are less common. Avoid?
   We want to test letters that are more likely to be in the word.

 Common consonants left: S, T, L, M, P, D, G, H, K, etc.

 So ""STOLE"" seems good: letters S, T, O, L.

 But what about vowels? We haven't tested O or I? 

 Also, we know E is already in the word and at the end, but what about other vowels? We don't know.

 Another option: using a word that might have an E in the middle? But wait: we know the last letter is fixed, but we might test for E at other positions? 
   However, if we don't put E at the end, then we won't get the feedback that the last letter is E? Actually, the feedback symbol for the last letter might change?

 But we know the secret word has E at the last position. So if we put E at the end again, we will get a check for the last letter, and then we can focus on the rest.

 Alternatively, if we put E somewhere else, then the last letter of our guess might be wrong? And we would get an 'x' for the last position? But that doesn't help because we already know the last position is E? 
   Actually, we don't want to deviate from the known letter because that would waste a letter slot.

 Strategy: keep the 5th letter fixed as E and guess for the first four.

 Therefore, we guess a word of the form _ _ _ _ E.

 Now, the word must be without C, R, A, N, and use letters that are common.

 Consider: ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E
 Consider: ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E
 Consider: ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E

 Among these, ""STOLE"" uses T and O which are very common. 

 Also, ""STOLE"" has the T and S which are commonly at the beginning or in the first few letters.

 I'll go with ""STOLE"" because it uses S, T, O, L which are common letters we haven't tried.

 So the guess is ""STOLE"".

<guess>stole</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- **E(✓)** indicates that the secret word ends with ""E"" (this position is now known).  
- **C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x)** mean these letters are **absent** from the secret word, so they must be avoided.  

The next guess should:  
1. End with **E** (to preserve the known correct position).  
2. Exclude **C, R, A, N**.  
3. Prioritize common unused letters like **S, T, L, O, P** to maximize information.  

A strong candidate is **""stole""**:  
- Ends with **E** (aligns with known position).  
- Uses new common consonants (**S, T, L**) and vowel (**O**).  
- Avoids excluded letters (**C, R, A, N**).  

This probe efficiently tests high-frequency letters while leveraging confirmed information.

<guess>stole</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) L(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   - C: absent (x)
   - R: absent (x)
   - A: absent (x)
   - N: absent (x)
   - E: correct (✓) at position 5

2. ""stole"":
   - S: present but wrong position (-)
   - T: absent (x)
   - O: present but wrong position (-)
   - L: absent (x)
   - E: correct (✓) at position 5

From this, we know:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5 is fixed).
- The letters C, R, A, N, T, L are absent. So we must avoid: C, R, A, N, T, L.
- The letters S and O are present in the word, but not in the positions we guessed:
   - In ""stole"", S was at position 1 and O at position 3. So S is not at position 1, and O is not at position 3.

Also, note that E is already fixed at position 5, and we know it's there. However, there might be another E? But we don't have information about that.

Now, the secret word has:
- S and O somewhere, but not at position 1 and not at position 3 (from the second guess). Also, since the word ends with E, the positions for S and O must be among 1,2,3,4? But position 5 is E, so positions 1,2,3,4 are open for S and O, but we know S is not at 1 and O is not at 3.

Moreover, we have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N, T, L.

So available letters: We have used: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O,L (but E, S, O are present; C,R,A,N,T,L are absent). So we can use any letters except: C,R,A,N,T,L.

But note: we have two present letters: S and O. So the secret word contains at least S and O (and E, which we already know).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains S and O (but not at position 1 for S, and not at position 3 for O)
- Does not contain C,R,A,N,T,L

Also, we have two more letters to guess? The word has 5 letters: we know E at 5, and we know S and O are in the word, so the other two letters must be from the remaining available letters.

Available letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven't tested: 
We have tested: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O,L (and T and L are absent, so avoid them).

So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know the word has S and O, so we must include them.

Now, for the next guess, we should try to place S and O in positions that are allowed (S not at 1, O not at 3) and also test new letters.

We have two positions to fill (besides the positions for S and O and the fixed E). Actually, the word has 5 positions. We know position 5 is E. We need to assign S and O to two of the first four positions, but with constraints: S cannot be at position 1, and O cannot be at position 3.

Possible positions for S: 2,3,4
Possible positions for O: 1,2,4 (since not 3)

But note: we don't know if S and O can be in the same word? They can, as long as the word exists.

We also need to choose two more letters from the available set.

We should choose common letters to maximize information.

Let me think of words that end with E, contain S and O, avoid C,R,A,N,T,L, and have S not at 1 and O not at 3.

Example: 
  ""POSSE"" -> but has S at position 4 and 5? But position 5 is E, so not. Also, O is at position 1? But we don't have constraint against O at 1? Actually, O can be at 1. But ""POSSE"" has two S's? And the last letter is E? ""POSSE"" is P-O-S-S-E. So:
  - Position 1: P (we don't know)
  - Position 2: O -> but in our feedback, O was present but not at position 3, so it can be at 2? Yes.
  - Position 3: S -> but we have constraint that S cannot be at position 1? It can be at 3? Yes, because in the second guess S was at 1 and was wrong, but it can be at 3? Actually, the feedback for ""stole"" only said S is not at 1, but it could be at 3 or 4. Similarly, O is not at 3, but it can be at 1,2,4.

But ""POSSE"" has two S's? And the last letter is E? Actually, ""POSSE"" is 5 letters: P-O-S-S-E. So it ends with E, and has O and S. But we have two S's? We don't know if the secret word has two S's? It might.

But we also have to avoid T and L? ""POSSE"" doesn't have T or L, so it's okay.

But let's check the feedback we would get if we guess ""POSSE""? We are not actually guessing it, but we need to see if it fits the constraints.

Alternatively, we can try to think of other words.

Another word: ""HOUSE"" -> H-O-U-S-E. 
  - Ends with E.
  - Contains O and S.
  - O is at position 2? Then S at position 4? 
  - Avoids C,R,A,N,T,L? H, O, U, S, E -> no T, no L, so okay.

But we haven't tested H and U.

Another: ""MOUSE"" -> M-O-U-S-E, same as above.

But we don't know if H or M or U are in the word.

We could also try a word that puts S and O in different positions and tests new common letters.

We know S is not at 1, so we can put S at 2,3, or 4.
We know O is not at 3, so we can put O at 1,2, or 4.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me list possible words:

Option 1: O at position 1, S at position 4: e.g., ""O__S_E"" -> but the last is E, so ""O__SE"". What words? Like ""OPUSE""? Not common. ""OUNCE"" but has N and C? Excluded. 

Option 2: O at position 2, S at position 3: ""O"" at 2 and ""S"" at 3: word pattern: _ O S _ E. Words: ""DOSE"" is 4 letters. ""DOSSE"" not a word. ""MOSSE"" not common? ""POSSE"" has S at 3 and 4? Not exactly. ""POSSE"" is P-O-S-S-E, so S at 3 and 4? Then O is at 2? So pattern: _ O S S E.

But we can have ""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> O at 2, S at 4.

Another: ""MOUSE"": same.

Option 3: O at position 2, S at position 4: that's ""HOUSE"".

Option 4: O at position 4, S at position 2: pattern: _ S _ O E. Words: ""ISSUE"" but has I and S at 2? ""ISSUE"" is I-S-S-U-E -> S at 2 and 3? Not exactly. We need S at 2 and O at 4? So pattern: _ S _ O E. Example: ""SCOPE"" but has C? Excluded. ""STOKE"" has T? Excluded. ""SHOES"" is S-H-O-E-S -> but ends with S, not E? We need E at the end.

Actually, ""SHOE"" is 4 letters. 

What about ""SMOKE""? But has K? And O at 3? But we are trying O at 4? Not.

It's hard to find a word with S at 2 and O at 4? 

Alternatively, O at 1 and S at 3: pattern: O _ S _ E. Words: ""OPSIS"" not ending with E? ""OUNCE"" excluded. ""OZONE"" has Z and O at 1 and 3? O-Z-O-N-E -> but O at 1 and 3? And N excluded. Not.

O at 1 and S at 4: pattern: O _ _ S E. Words: ""OASES"" is O-A-S-E-S -> but A excluded, and ends with S? Not E. ""OPSET"" not a word? ""OBIES"" not common.

So the most common words are like ""HOUSE"", ""MOUSE"", ""POISE"" (but ""POISE"" is P-O-I-S-E, so O at 2 and S at 4? Actually, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4? Then E at 5. And P at 1.

But ""POISE"" uses P, O, I, S, E. Avoids the excluded letters? C,R,A,N,T,L? Yes.

Similarly, ""NOISE"" has N? Excluded.

""MOISE"" not a word.

""HOISE"" not common.

So ""POISE"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""BOUSE"" not common.

We also have ""VOICE"" but has C? Excluded.

So let's consider ""POISE"" and ""HOUSE"".

But we also have the feedback that in the second guess, O was at position 3 and was wrong? But in ""POISE"", O is at position 2? That's allowed. And S is at position 4? In the second guess, S was at position 1 and was wrong, so S at 4 is allowed.

Similarly, for ""HOUSE"": O at 2, S at 4.

But we don't know if P or H or I (in ""POISE"") are in the word.

We need to choose a word that tests new letters.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: H, I, M, P, U, etc.

We can choose ""POISE"" to test P, O, I, S, E. But O and S we already know are present, so we are testing P and I.

Similarly, ""HOUSE"" tests H, O, U, S, E -> tests H and U.

But note: we have two present letters (S and O) that we must include, so we are forced to include them. The other two letters we choose should be new.

We can also consider a word that puts S and O in positions that we haven't tried and that are more informative.

For example, we know S is not at 1, so we can try S at position 2 or 3 or 4. Similarly for O.

In the second guess, we tried O at position 3 and it was wrong? Actually, in ""stole"", O was at position 3 and we got a minus, meaning it is in the word but not at 3. So we can try O at position 2 or 4.

Similarly, S was at 1 and wrong, so we can try S at 2,3,4.

To get more information, we might try S at a position we haven't tried, like 2 or 4? We tried 1 and it was wrong, so we avoid 1.

Similarly, O we tried at 3 and it was wrong, so avoid 3.

So let's try to put S at position 2 and O at position 4? But we couldn't find a common word for that.

Alternatively, S at position 3 and O at position 2? That would be pattern: _ O S _ E. Words: ""DOSE"" is 4 letters. ""DOSED"" is 5 but ends with D? Not E. ""POSER"" not ends with E. ""POSSE"" is P-O-S-S-E, so S at 3 and 4? Then O at 2? So that's a pattern: _ O S S E. But we don't know if there are two S's.

Another word: ""GOOSE"" has O at 2 and 3? And ends with E? G-O-O-S-E -> O at 2 and 3? But we have constraint that O cannot be at 3? Because in ""stole"", O at 3 was wrong? So if we put O at 3 again, it would be wrong? But we know it's not at 3, so we shouldn't put it at 3.

So we must avoid putting O at position 3 and S at position 1.

Therefore, for ""POSSE"", if we put O at 2 and S at 3 and 4? But O at 2 is allowed, and S at 3 is allowed? But we don't know if S can be at 3? We haven't tried S at 3.

But the word ""POSSE"" has two S's? We don't know if the secret word has two S's.

Alternatively, we can try ""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> positions: O at 2, S at 4. Both allowed.

Similarly, ""POISE"": P-O-I-S-E -> O at 2, S at 4.

I think ""HOUSE"" and ""POISE"" are both good.

But let's see which one tests more common letters. ""HOUSE"" has H and U, ""POISE"" has P and I.

H and P are both common, I and U are vowels.

We can choose one.

Another idea: we know that in the secret word, the letter at position 1 is not S (from second guess) and not C,R,A,N,T,L. So it must be one of the available letters.

We can try to use a word that has a common letter at position 1, and then O and S in allowed positions.

For example, with ""HOUSE"": H at 1, O at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

This tests H at 1, O at 2 (which is allowed for O? Yes, O can be at 2), U at 3, S at 4.

But we have a constraint that O cannot be at 3? But we are putting O at 2, which is fine. And S at 4 is fine.

Similarly, ""POISE"": P at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

This tests P at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4.

But note: in the second guess, we don't have information about position 3 for S? We only know S is not at 1. So S at 3 is possible? But in ""POISE"", S is at 4, not 3.

Also, for O, we are putting it at 2, which is allowed.

I think both are valid.

But let's consider the feedback we might get.

We might also consider ""MOUSE"": M at 1, O at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

I think I'll go with ""HOUSE"" because H is a common starting letter.

So guess: ""HOUSE""

But let's double-check the feedback we have: in the first guess, we had no H, so we don't know about H.

Similarly, in the second guess, no H.

So it's a new letter.

But note: we have to avoid T and L? Yes, and HOUSE has no T or L.

So I'll go with ""HOUSE"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""HOUSE"" is a valid word.

So next guess: ""HOUSE""

But let's see if there's a better word that tests more vowels? We haven't tested I or U? ""HOUSE"" tests U, which is a vowel.

Alternatively, ""POISE"" tests I.

But I think both are fine.

We can also consider ""SHOWY"" but doesn't end with E.

Another word: ""BIOME"" but has B,I,O,M,E -> but we need to include S? We know S is in the word, so we must include S. So we cannot use ""BIOME"" because it doesn't have S.

We must include S and O.

So ""HOUSE"" includes S and O.

Therefore, I choose ""HOUSE"".

<guess>house</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → E is correct and in position 5. C, R, A, N are absent.
- **Guess 2: stole** → S and O are present but in the wrong positions (S not at 1, O not at 3). T and L are absent. E is confirmed at position 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed position**: The 5th letter is **E**.
- **Present letters**: **S** and **O** must appear in the word, but:
  - S cannot be at position 1 (from ""stole"" feedback).
  - O cannot be at position 3 (from ""stole"" feedback).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, T, L (must avoid these).
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, 3, and 4 need to be resolved, with S and O placed in valid positions (S: positions 2, 3, or 4; O: positions 1, 2, or 4).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters** (e.g., H, I, P, U) while including S and O in allowed positions.
- **End with E** to maintain the known position.
- **Avoid absent letters** (C, R, A, N, T, L).
- **Valid word structure**: S not at 1, O not at 3.

### Chosen Guess: ""HOUSE""
- **H**: New letter (common consonant, tests position 1).
- **O**: Position 2 (allowed, since O cannot be at 3).
- **U**: New letter (common vowel, tests position 3).
- **S**: Position 4 (allowed, since S cannot be at 1).
- **E**: Position 5 (confirmed).

This guess efficiently:
  - Tests S and O in new valid positions (O at 2, S at 4).
  - Probes two new common letters (H and U).
  - Avoids all excluded letters.

But typically, if you guess a word with two E\'s and the secret has only one E, then one E will be marked as in the word (if it\'s in the word) and the other will be marked as not present? \n\n But in our case, we have no information about whether E appears elsewhere because we only had one E in the guess.\n\n Therefore, for our next guess, we should:\n  - Avoid C, R, A, N.\n  - The word must end with E? Not necessarily, but if we try a word that doesn\'t have E at the end, then we might get feedback for E at other positions? \n    However, we already know that the word ends with E. So if we put E at the last position again, we can focus on guessing the first four letters.\n\n It is better to use a word that has E in the last position again because we know that position is fixed. Then we can concentrate on the other four letters.\n\n Let me think of common words ending in E that use common remaining letters.\n\n Common letters that we haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, Y, etc.\n\n Example words: \n  - SOLE: but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5 letter words.\n  - STYLE? But has S,T,Y,L,E -> note E is at the end.\n\n We must form a valid 5-letter word.\n\n Some words: \n   ""STYLE"": S,T,Y,L,E\n   ""TABLE"": but T and A? Wait, A is already excluded? We cannot use A because we know A is not in the secret word. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, N.\n\n So ""TABLE"" is invalid because it contains A, which we know is not in the word.\n\n Let\'s try to form words ending in E without C,R,A,N.\n\n Possible words: \n   ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E\n   ""STYLE"" -> S,T,Y,L,E\n   ""PHONE"" -> P,H,O,N,E -> but N is excluded? We know N is not in the word? So we cannot use N? Yes.\n\n How about ""SLIME"" -> S,L,I,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N and uses new letters.\n\n Another: ""SHINE"" -> S,H,I,N,E -> contains N? Yes, we cannot use N.\n\n Another: ""SPIKE"" -> S,P,I,K,E -> avoids forbidden letters.\n\n Also, ""SOLE"" isn\'t 5 letters, but ""SOLVE"" -> S,O,L,V,E -> avoids forbidden letters.\n\n Another: ""BIOME"" -> B,I,O,M,E -> avoids forbidden.\n\n But note: we want to maximize information by using a lot of common consonants and vowels.\n\n The letters S and T are very common. Also L, I, O are good.\n\n Let me pick ""SPIKE"" because it includes S, P, I, K, E? But E already we know, so we are testing S, P, I, K.\n\n However, note that ""SPIKE"" has I as the third letter and K as the fourth.\n\n Another good candidate: ""SLIDE"" is invalid because D? Wait, we haven\'t tested D, but also L,I,D,E -> and E at the end. But note: ""SLIDE"" avoids C,R,A,N.\n\n Actually, ""SLIDE"" has D which is common? But we don\'t know. Also, it uses S and L.\n\n Alternatively, ""SHIRE"": but H,I,R,E -> wait, R is excluded? We know R is not in the word? So we cannot use R.\n\n Yes, R is excluded. So we cannot use R.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid: C, R, A, N.\n\n So any word without these letters.\n\n Let me list common words ending in E without these letters: \n   ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E\n   ""STYLE"": S,T,Y,L,E\n   ""SLIME"": S,L,I,M,E\n   ""PHONE"": invalid because of N\n   ""SPIKE"": S,P,I,K,E\n   ""BLUES"": but that has E at the fourth? Actually we need E at the fifth? So we need words ending in E.\n\n Also: ""QUOTE"": Q,U,O,T,E -> uses Q and U which are less common. Avoid?\n   We want to test letters that are more likely to be in the word.\n\n Common consonants left: S, T, L, M, P, D, G, H, K, etc.\n\n So ""STOLE"" seems good: letters S, T, O, L.\n\n But what about vowels? We haven\'t tested O or I? \n\n Also, we know E is already in the word and at the end, but what about other vowels? We don\'t know.\n\n Another option: using a word that might have an E in the middle? But wait: we know the last letter is fixed, but we might test for E at other positions? \n   However, if we don\'t put E at the end, then we won\'t get the feedback that the last letter is E? Actually, the feedback symbol for the last letter might change?\n\n But we know the secret word has E at the last position. So if we put E at the end again, we will get a check for the last letter, and then we can focus on the rest.\n\n Alternatively, if we put E somewhere else, then the last letter of our guess might be wrong? And we would get an \'x\' for the last position? But that doesn\'t help because we already know the last position is E? \n   Actually, we don\'t want to deviate from the known letter because that would waste a letter slot.\n\n Strategy: keep the 5th letter fixed as E and guess for the first four.\n\n Therefore, we guess a word of the form _ _ _ _ E.\n\n Now, the word must be without C, R, A, N, and use letters that are common.\n\n Consider: ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E\n Consider: ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E\n Consider: ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E\n\n Among these, ""STOLE"" uses T and O which are very common. \n\n Also, ""STOLE"" has the T and S which are commonly at the beginning or in the first few letters.\n\n I\'ll go with ""STOLE"" because it uses S, T, O, L which are common letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n So the guess is ""STOLE"".\n\n<guess>stole</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- **E(✓)** indicates that the secret word ends with ""E"" (this position is now known).  \n- **C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x)** mean these letters are **absent** from the secret word, so they must be avoided.  \n\nThe next guess should:  \n1. End with **E** (to preserve the known correct position).  \n2. Exclude **C, R, A, N**.  \n3. Prioritize common unused letters like **S, T, L, O, P** to maximize information.  \n\nA strong candidate is **""stole""**:  \n- Ends with **E** (aligns with known position).  \n- Uses new common consonants (**S, T, L**) and vowel (**O**).  \n- Avoids excluded letters (**C, R, A, N**).  \n\nThis probe efficiently tests high-frequency letters while leveraging confirmed information.\n\n<guess>stole</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) L(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1.

""stole"":\n   - S: present but wrong position (-)\n   - T: absent (x)\n   - O: present but wrong position (-)\n   - L: absent (x)\n   - E: correct (✓) at position 5\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word ends with E (position 5 is fixed).\n- The letters C, R, A, N, T, L are absent. So we must avoid: C, R, A, N, T, L.\n- The letters S and O are present in the word, but not in the positions we guessed:\n   - In ""stole"", S was at position 1 and O at position 3. So S is not at position 1, and O is not at position 3.\n\nAlso, note that E is already fixed at position 5, and we know it\'s there. However, there might be another E? But we don\'t have information about that.\n\nNow, the secret word has:\n- S and O somewhere, but not at position 1 and not at position 3 (from the second guess). Also, since the word ends with E, the positions for S and O must be among 1,2,3,4? But position 5 is E, so positions 1,2,3,4 are open for S and O, but we know S is not at 1 and O is not at 3.\n\nMoreover, we have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N, T, L.\n\nSo available letters: We have used: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O,L (but E, S, O are present; C,R,A,N,T,L are absent). So we can use any letters except: C,R,A,N,T,L.\n\nBut note: we have two present letters: S and O. So the secret word contains at least S and O (and E, which we already know).\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Ends with E (position 5)\n- Contains S and O (but not at position 1 for S, and not at position 3 for O)\n- Does not contain C,R,A,N,T,L\n\nAlso, we have two more letters to guess? The word has 5 letters: we know E at 5, and we know S and O are in the word, so the other two letters must be from the remaining available letters.\n\nAvailable letters (consonants and vowels) that we haven\'t tested: \nWe have tested: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O,L (and T and L are absent, so avoid them).\n\nSo available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we also know the word has S and O, so we must include them.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we should try to place S and O in positions that are allowed (S not at 1, O not at 3) and also test new letters.\n\nWe have two positions to fill (besides the positions for S and O and the fixed E). Actually, the word has 5 positions. We know position 5 is E. We need to assign S and O to two of the first four positions, but with constraints: S cannot be at position 1, and O cannot be at position 3.\n\nPossible positions for S: 2,3,4\nPossible positions for O: 1,2,4 (since not 3)\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if S and O can be in the same word? They can, as long as the word exists.\n\nWe also need to choose two more letters from the available set.\n\nWe should choose common letters to maximize information.\n\nLet me think of words that end with E, contain S and O, avoid C,R,A,N,T,L, and have S not at 1 and O not at 3.\n\nExample: \n  ""POSSE"" -> but has S at position 4 and 5? But position 5 is E, so not. Also, O is at position 1? But we don\'t have constraint against O at 1? Actually, O can be at 1. But ""POSSE"" has two S\'s? And the last letter is E? ""POSSE"" is P-O-S-S-E. So:\n  - Position 1: P (we don\'t know)\n  - Position 2: O -> but in our feedback, O was present but not at position 3, so it can be at 2? Yes.\n  - Position 3: S -> but we have constraint that S cannot be at position 1? It can be at 3? Yes, because in the second guess S was at 1 and was wrong, but it can be at 3? Actually, the feedback for ""stole"" only said S is not at 1, but it could be at 3 or 4. Similarly, O is not at 3, but it can be at 1,2,4.\n\nBut ""POSSE"" has two S\'s? And the last letter is E? Actually, ""POSSE"" is 5 letters: P-O-S-S-E. So it ends with E, and has O and S. But we have two S\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s? It might.\n\nBut we also have to avoid T and L? ""POSSE"" doesn\'t have T or L, so it\'s okay.\n\nBut let\'s check the feedback we would get if we guess ""POSSE""? We are not actually guessing it, but we need to see if it fits the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to think of other words.\n\nAnother word: ""HOUSE"" -> H-O-U-S-E. \n  - Ends with E.\n  - Contains O and S.\n  - O is at position 2? Then S at position 4? \n  - Avoids C,R,A,N,T,L? H, O, U, S, E -> no T, no L, so okay.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested H and U.\n\nAnother: ""MOUSE"" -> M-O-U-S-E, same as above.\n\nBut we don\'t know if H or M or U are in the word.\n\nWe could also try a word that puts S and O in different positions and tests new common letters.\n\nWe know S is not at 1, so we can put S at 2,3, or 4.\nWe know O is not at 3, so we can put O at 1,2, or 4.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\nOption 1: O at position 1, S at position 4: e.g., ""O__S_E"" -> but the last is E, so ""O__SE"". What words? Like ""OPUSE""? Not common. ""OUNCE"" but has N and C? Excluded. \n\nOption 2: O at position 2, S at position 3: ""O"" at 2 and ""S"" at 3: word pattern: _ O S _ E. Words: ""DOSE"" is 4 letters. ""DOSSE"" not a word. ""MOSSE"" not common? ""POSSE"" has S at 3 and 4? Not exactly. ""POSSE"" is P-O-S-S-E, so S at 3 and 4? Then O is at 2? So pattern: _ O S S E.\n\nBut we can have ""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> O at 2, S at 4.\n\nAnother: ""MOUSE"": same.\n\nOption 3: O at position 2, S at position 4: that\'s ""HOUSE"".\n\nOption 4: O at position 4, S at position 2: pattern: _ S _ O E. Words: ""ISSUE"" but has I and S at 2? ""ISSUE"" is I-S-S-U-E -> S at 2 and 3? Not exactly. We need S at 2 and O at 4? So pattern: _ S _ O E. Example: ""SCOPE"" but has C? Excluded. ""STOKE"" has T? Excluded. ""SHOES"" is S-H-O-E-S -> but ends with S, not E? We need E at the end.\n\nActually, ""SHOE"" is 4 letters. \n\nWhat about ""SMOKE""? But has K? And O at 3? But we are trying O at 4? Not.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with S at 2 and O at 4? \n\nAlternatively, O at 1 and S at 3: pattern: O _ S _ E. Words: ""OPSIS"" not ending with E? ""OUNCE"" excluded. ""OZONE"" has Z and O at 1 and 3? O-Z-O-N-E -> but O at 1 and 3? And N excluded. Not.\n\nO at 1 and S at 4: pattern: O _ _ S E. Words: ""OASES"" is O-A-S-E-S -> but A excluded, and ends with S? Not E. ""OPSET"" not a word? ""OBIES"" not common.\n\nSo the most common words are like ""HOUSE"", ""MOUSE"", ""POISE"" (but ""POISE"" is P-O-I-S-E, so O at 2 and S at 4? Actually, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4? Then E at 5. And P at 1.\n\nBut ""POISE"" uses P, O, I, S, E. Avoids the excluded letters? C,R,A,N,T,L? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""NOISE"" has N? Excluded.\n\n""MOISE"" not a word.\n\n""HOISE"" not common.\n\nSo ""POISE"" is a candidate.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BOUSE"" not common.\n\nWe also have ""VOICE"" but has C? Excluded.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""POISE"" and ""HOUSE"".\n\nBut we also have the feedback that in the second guess, O was at position 3 and was wrong? But in ""POISE"", O is at position 2? That\'s allowed. And S is at position 4? In the second guess, S was at position 1 and was wrong, so S at 4 is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, for ""HOUSE"": O at 2, S at 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know if P or H or I (in ""POISE"") are in the word.\n\nWe need to choose a word that tests new letters.\n\nWe have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon letters: H, I, M, P, U, etc.\n\nWe can choose ""POISE"" to test P, O, I, S, E. But O and S we already know are present, so we are testing P and I.\n\nSimilarly, ""HOUSE"" tests H, O, U, S, E -> tests H and U.\n\nBut note: we have two present letters (S and O) that we must include, so we are forced to include them. The other two letters we choose should be new.\n\nWe can also consider a word that puts S and O in positions that we haven\'t tried and that are more informative.\n\nFor example, we know S is not at 1, so we can try S at position 2 or 3 or 4. Similarly for O.\n\nIn the second guess, we tried O at position 3 and it was wrong? Actually, in ""stole"", O was at position 3 and we got a minus, meaning it is in the word but not at 3. So we can try O at position 2 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, S was at 1 and wrong, so we can try S at 2,3,4.\n\nTo get more information, we might try S at a position we haven\'t tried, like 2 or 4? We tried 1 and it was wrong, so we avoid 1.\n\nSimilarly, O we tried at 3 and it was wrong, so avoid 3.\n\nSo let\'s try to put S at position 2 and O at position 4? But we couldn\'t find a common word for that.\n\nAlternatively, S at position 3 and O at position 2? That would be pattern: _ O S _ E. Words: ""DOSE"" is 4 letters. ""DOSED"" is 5 but ends with D? Not E. ""POSER"" not ends with E. ""POSSE"" is P-O-S-S-E, so S at 3 and 4? Then O at 2? So that\'s a pattern: _ O S S E. But we don\'t know if there are two S\'s.\n\nAnother word: ""GOOSE"" has O at 2 and 3? And ends with E? G-O-O-S-E -> O at 2 and 3? But we have constraint that O cannot be at 3? Because in ""stole"", O at 3 was wrong? So if we put O at 3 again, it would be wrong? But we know it\'s not at 3, so we shouldn\'t put it at 3.\n\nSo we must avoid putting O at position 3 and S at position 1.\n\nTherefore, for ""POSSE"", if we put O at 2 and S at 3 and 4? But O at 2 is allowed, and S at 3 is allowed? But we don\'t know if S can be at 3? We haven\'t tried S at 3.\n\nBut the word ""POSSE"" has two S\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""HOUSE"": H-O-U-S-E -> positions: O at 2, S at 4. Both allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""POISE"": P-O-I-S-E -> O at 2, S at 4.\n\nI think ""HOUSE"" and ""POISE"" are both good.\n\nBut let\'s see which one tests more common letters. ""HOUSE"" has H and U, ""POISE"" has P and I.\n\nH and P are both common, I and U are vowels.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nAnother idea: we know that in the secret word, the letter at position 1 is not S (from second guess) and not C,R,A,N,T,L. So it must be one of the available letters.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has a common letter at position 1, and then O and S in allowed positions.\n\nFor example, with ""HOUSE"": H at 1, O at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5.\n\nThis tests H at 1, O at 2 (which is allowed for O? Yes, O can be at 2), U at 3, S at 4.\n\nBut we have a constraint that O cannot be at 3? But we are putting O at 2, which is fine. And S at 4 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, ""POISE"": P at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5.\n\nThis tests P at 1, O at 2, I at 3, S at 4.\n\nBut note: in the second guess, we don\'t have information about position 3 for S? We only know S is not at 1. So S at 3 is possible? But in ""POISE"", S is at 4, not 3.\n\nAlso, for O, we are putting it at 2, which is allowed.\n\nI think both are valid.\n\nBut let\'s consider the feedback we might get.\n\nWe might also consider ""MOUSE"": M at 1, O at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""HOUSE"" because H is a common starting letter.\n\nSo guess: ""HOUSE""\n\nBut let\'s double-check the feedback we have: in the first guess, we had no H, so we don\'t know about H.\n\nSimilarly, in the second guess, no H.\n\nSo it\'s a new letter.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid T and L? Yes, and HOUSE has no T or L.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""HOUSE"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""HOUSE"" is a valid word.\n\nSo next guess: ""HOUSE""\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a better word that tests more vowels? We haven\'t tested I or U? ""HOUSE"" tests U, which is a vowel.\n\nAlternatively, ""POISE"" tests I.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHOWY"" but doesn\'t end with E.\n\nAnother word: ""BIOME"" but has B,I,O,M,E -> but we need to include S? We know S is in the word, so we must include S. So we cannot use ""BIOME"" because it doesn\'t have S.\n\nWe must include S and O.\n\nSo ""HOUSE"" includes S and O.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""HOUSE"".\n\n<guess>house</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → E is correct and in position 5. C, R, A, N are absent.\n- **Guess 2: stole** → S and O are present but in the wrong positions (S not at 1, O not at 3). T and L are absent. E is confirmed at position 5.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed position**: The 5th letter is **E**.\n- **Present letters**: **S** and **O** must appear in the word, but:\n  - S cannot be at position 1 (from ""stole"" feedback).\n  - O cannot be at position 3 (from ""stole"" feedback).\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, T, L (must avoid these).\n- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, 3, and 4 need to be resolved, with S and O placed in valid positions (S: positions 2, 3, or 4; O: positions 1, 2, or 4).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters** (e.g., H, I, P, U) while including S and O in allowed positions.\n- **End with E** to maintain the known position.\n- **Avoid absent letters** (C, R, A, N, T, L).\n- **Valid word structure**: S not at 1, O not at 3.\n\n### Chosen Guess: ""HOUSE""\n- **H**: New letter (common consonant, tests position 1).\n- **O**: Position 2 (allowed, since O cannot be at 3).\n- **U**: New letter (common vowel, tests position 3).\n- **S**: Position 4 (allowed, since S cannot be at 1).\n- **E**: Position 5 (confirmed).\n\nThis guess efficiently:\n  - Tests S and O in new valid positions (O at 2, S at 4).\n  - Probes two new common letters (H and U).\n  - Avoids all excluded letters.\n\n<guess>house</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) L(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: house -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) U(✓) S(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th). C, R, A, N are absent.
2. ""stole"": S(-), T(x), O(-), L(x), E(✓) → S and O are in the word but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively. T and L are absent. E is correct at 5th.
3. ""house"": H(x), O(✓), U(✓), S(✓), E(✓) → O, U, S, E are correct. Specifically:
   - O is in the correct position (position 2, since in ""house"" O is at position 2 and it's marked correct).
   - U is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in ""house"" U is at 3 and marked correct).
   - S is in the correct position (position 4, since in ""house"" S is at 4 and marked correct).
   - E is correct at position 5 (already known).
   - H is absent.

So from ""house"":
- O is at position 2 (correct).
- U is at position 3 (correct).
- S is at position 4 (correct).
- E is at position 5 (correct).
- H is absent.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ O U S E

We only need to find the first letter.

We know the first letter cannot be:
- H (absent from ""house"")
- C, R, A, N (absent from ""crane"")
- T, L (absent from ""stole"")

So absent letters: C, R, A, N, T, L, H.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ O U S E that is not using any of the absent letters.

Possible letters for the first position: any letter except C, R, A, N, T, L, H, and also we must consider that the word must be valid.

Common letters that could fit: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to choose a word that is common and uses a letter that might be likely.

We know the word is ""?OUSE"". There are several common words ending in ""OUSE"", such as:
- MOUSE
- HOUSE (but H is absent, so not)
- LOUSE (but L is absent)
- ROUSE (R is absent)
- DOUSE
- SOUSE (but S is already at position 4? The word would be SOUSE? But that has S at position 1 and 4? But we know S is at position 4, and we don't know about another S? However, in the feedback from ""stole"", we had S marked as present but not at position 1, which is consistent with S at position 4. But if we have ""SOUSE"", then S is at position 1 and 4? But we have H absent, and also S at position 1: but in ""stole"", we guessed S at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position? That would imply that S is in the word but not at position 1. If the word were ""SOUSE"", then S is at position 1, which would have been marked as correct? But in ""stole"", S at position 1 was marked with '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So if the word had S at position 1, it would have been marked as correct (✓). Therefore, the secret word cannot have S at position 1. So ""SOUSE"" is invalid because it would have S at position 1, which we know is not the case.

Therefore, the first letter cannot be S? Actually, we know S is at position 4, and we don't know if there is another S? But if there were an S at position 1, then in the ""stole"" guess, when we put S at position 1, it should have been marked as correct? But it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that S is in the word but not at position 1. Therefore, the secret word does not have S at position 1. So if we try a word with S at position 1, it would be incorrect. Hence, ""SOUSE"" is not possible.

Similarly, we cannot have a word with S at position 1.

So back to the form: _ O U S E

Common words:
- MOUSE: M at position 1. M is not in the absent list.
- DOUSE: D at position 1.
- GOUSE? Not common.
- POUSE? Not common.

Also, ""BOUSE"" is not common.

""MOUSE"" is a very common word.

We also have ""JOUSE"" not common.

Therefore, the most likely candidate is ""MOUSE"".

But we must confirm that M has not been tested? We haven't guessed M before, so we don't know if it's in the word? But in this case, we are only missing the first letter, and we know the other four are fixed: O, U, S, E at positions 2,3,4,5.

So if we guess ""MOUSE"", we are testing M at position 1.

If M is correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that M is absent, and then we can try another letter.

But since we have only one letter to guess, and we have limited options, we can try ""MOUSE"".

Alternatively, we can try ""DOUSE"" to test D.

But ""MOUSE"" is more common.

We also have ""FOUSE"" not common.

So I think ""MOUSE"" is the best guess.

But note: we have to make sure that M is not excluded. It is not in the absent list.

Therefore, I will guess ""MOUSE"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - Feedback: C(absent), R(absent), A(absent), N(absent), E(**correct position, 5th letter**).  
   - Key takeaway: **E** is in the word and locked at position 5. C, R, A, N are absent.

2. **Guess 2: ""stole""**  
   - Feedback: S(**present, wrong position**), T(absent), O(**present, wrong position**), L(absent), E(**correct position**).  
   - Key takeaways:  
     - S is in the word but not at position 1.  
     - O is in the word but not at position 3.  
     - T and L are absent.  
     - E is confirmed at position 5.

3. **Guess 3: ""house""**  
   - Feedback: H(absent), O(**correct position, 2nd letter**), U(**correct position, 3rd letter**), S(**correct position, 4th letter**), E(**correct position, 5th letter**).  
   - Key takeaways:  
     - O is at position 2.  
     - U is at position 3.  
     - S is at position 4.  
     - E is at position 5.  
     - H is absent.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word structure**: `_ O U S E` (only the 1st letter is unknown).  
- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
  - Position 2: **O**  
  - Position 3: **U**  
  - Position 4: **S**  
  - Position 5: **E**  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, T, L, H (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Constraints for 1st letter**:  
  - Must be a valid English letter not in {C, R, A, N, T, L, H}.  
  - Must form a valid 5-letter word ending in ""OUSE"".  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The only unknown is the 1st letter. We need to guess a word of the form `X O U S E`, where **X** is a letter not excluded.  
- Common words fitting this pattern:  
  - **MOUSE** (M at position 1)  
  - **DOUSE** (D at position 1)  
  - Less common: **BOUSE**, **GOUSE** (not standard English).  
- **M** is a high-frequency consonant not yet tested. ""MOUSE"" is a common word, making it a strong candidate to test the 1st position.  
- If ""MOUSE"" is incorrect, feedback will confirm if **M** is present/absent, narrowing options to rarer words like ""DOUSE"".  

### Next Guess: ""MOUSE""
- Tests **M** at position 1 while confirming the known positions (O, U, S, E).  
- Avoids all excluded letters.  

<guess>mouse</guess>",mouse,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th). C, R, A, N are absent.
2. ""stole"": S(-), T(x), O(-), L(x), E(✓) → S and O are in the word but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively. T and L are absent. E is correct at 5th.
3. ""house"": H(x), O(✓), U(✓), S(✓), E(✓) → O, U, S, E are correct. Specifically:
   - O is in the correct position (position 2, since in ""house"" O is at position 2 and it's marked correct).
   - U is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in ""house"" U is at 3 and marked correct).
   - S is in the correct position (position 4, since in ""house"" S is at 4 and marked correct).
   - E is correct at position 5 (already known).
   - H is absent.

So from ""house"":
- O is at position 2 (correct).
- U is at position 3 (correct).
- S is at position 4 (correct).
- E is at position 5 (correct).
- H is absent.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ O U S E

We only need to find the first letter.

We know the first letter cannot be:
- H (absent from ""house"")
- C, R, A, N (absent from ""crane"")
- T, L (absent from ""stole"")

So absent letters: C, R, A, N, T, L, H.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ O U S E that is not using any of the absent letters.

Possible letters for the first position: any letter except C, R, A, N, T, L, H, and also we must consider that the word must be valid.

Common letters that could fit: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to choose a word that is common and uses a letter that might be likely.

We know the word is ""?OUSE"". There are several common words ending in ""OUSE"", such as:
- MOUSE
- HOUSE (but H is absent, so not)
- LOUSE (but L is absent)
- ROUSE (R is absent)
- DOUSE
- SOUSE (but S is already at position 4? The word would be SOUSE? But that has S at position 1 and 4? But we know S is at position 4, and we don't know about another S? However, in the feedback from ""stole"", we had S marked as present but not at position 1, which is consistent with S at position 4. But if we have ""SOUSE"", then S is at position 1 and 4? But we have H absent, and also S at position 1: but in ""stole"", we guessed S at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position? That would imply that S is in the word but not at position 1. If the word were ""SOUSE"", then S is at position 1, which would have been marked as correct? But in ""stole"", S at position 1 was marked with '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So if the word had S at position 1, it would have been marked as correct (✓). Therefore, the secret word cannot have S at position 1. So ""SOUSE"" is invalid because it would have S at position 1, which we know is not the case.

Therefore, the first letter cannot be S? Actually, we know S is at position 4, and we don't know if there is another S? But if there were an S at position 1, then in the ""stole"" guess, when we put S at position 1, it should have been marked as correct? But it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that S is in the word but not at position 1. Therefore, the secret word does not have S at position 1. So if we try a word with S at position 1, it would be incorrect. Hence, ""SOUSE"" is not possible.

Similarly, we cannot have a word with S at position 1.

So back to the form: _ O U S E

Common words:
- MOUSE: M at position 1. M is not in the absent list.
- DOUSE: D at position 1.
- GOUSE? Not common.
- POUSE? Not common.

Also, ""BOUSE"" is not common.

""MOUSE"" is a very common word.

We also have ""JOUSE"" not common.

Therefore, the most likely candidate is ""MOUSE"".

But we must confirm that M has not been tested? We haven't guessed M before, so we don't know if it's in the word? But in this case, we are only missing the first letter, and we know the other four are fixed: O, U, S, E at positions 2,3,4,5.

So if we guess ""MOUSE"", we are testing M at position 1.

If M is correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that M is absent, and then we can try another letter.

But since we have only one letter to guess, and we have limited options, we can try ""MOUSE"".

Alternatively, we can try ""DOUSE"" to test D.

But ""MOUSE"" is more common.

We also have ""FOUSE"" not common.

So I think ""MOUSE"" is the best guess.

But note: we have to make sure that M is not excluded. It is not in the absent list.

Therefore, I will guess ""MOUSE"".
