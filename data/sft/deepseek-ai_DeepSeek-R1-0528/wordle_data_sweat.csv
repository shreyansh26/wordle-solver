We are making our first guess. We don't have any prior information.
It's a good idea to start with a word that has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
Common starting words in word games often include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", but for this we can also consider ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"".
However, let me pick a word that maximizes the information we get by covering frequent letters.

I think ""RAISE"" is a good choice because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also common but maybe less familiar.

But note: we must use a valid English word.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also very common.

Considering the frequencies of letters in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S.

So a word that uses as many of these as possible would be good.

I'll go with ""RAISE"": 
- R, A, I, S, E

But wait, I see that ""CRANE"" is also popular because C is common and it has the vowels.

However, without any prior information, I think ""RAISE"" is a solid choice.

Another popular starter is ""ADIEU"" to get vowels, but ADIEU only has one consonant and we can get more balanced information.

I'll go with:

For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information about the secret word. A good starting word should include common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to increase the chances of getting useful feedback. Letters like E, A, R, S, T, and I are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words. 

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it:
- Contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)
- Uses high-frequency letters that appear in many words
- Is a valid English word

This guess may reveal:
- Positionally correct letters (via ✓)
- Incorrectly placed letters (via -)
- Absent letters (via x)

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": 
R(x) - R is not in the secret word at all.
A(-) - A is in the word but not in the second position.
I(x) - I is not in the secret word.
S(-) - S is in the word but not in the fourth position.
E(-) - E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A, S, and E, but not R or I.
- The positions: 
  - A is not in position 2 (so it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the word has 5 positions, and we know A is present but not in position 2).
  - Similarly, S is not in position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.
  - E is not in position 5, so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Also, we know that the secret word does not contain R or I.

Now, we have to make a second guess. We should try to use a word that:
- Includes the known present letters (A, S, E) in positions we haven't tried yet (to test their correct positions).
- Avoids the absent letters (R, I).
- Includes other common letters to test for presence.

We know the word has A, S, and E. Since there are 5 letters, there are two more letters we don't know.

We should try to place A, S, and E in different positions than in the first guess.

In the first guess, we had:
Position 1: R (absent)
Position 2: A (present but wrong position)
Position 3: I (absent)
Position 4: S (present but wrong position)
Position 5: E (present but wrong position)

So for the second guess, we should avoid putting A in position 2, S in position 4, and E in position 5.

We can try to put A in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don't know which one is correct. Similarly for S and E.

We also want to test new letters. Since we have three known letters (A, S, E) and two unknown, we can choose a word that has A, S, E and two new letters.

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

Let me think of words that contain A, S, E and avoid R and I.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, etc.

We can try to form a word with A, S, E and two of these.

We also want to test the positions differently.

For example, we can try:
- Put A in position 1? Then we have A _ _ _ _
- But we also have S and E to place, avoiding S in position 4 and E in position 5.

Alternatively, we can try A in position 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly for S: we can put it in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (avoiding 4).

For E: we can put it in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (avoiding 5).

Let me list some words that have A, S, E and two other letters (not R, not I).

Possible words:
- ""SAUCE"": has S, A, U, C, E -> but S is in position 1 (which is new), A in 2 (but we know A is not in position 2? No, we only know that in the first guess A was in position 2 and it was wrong, but in the secret word A might be in position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for A was (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. So A cannot be in position 2 at all. Therefore, in our new guess, we must avoid putting A in position 2.

Similarly, we must avoid S in position 4 and E in position 5.

So for ""SAUCE"":
- S is in position 1 -> okay (since we haven't tested S in position 1 and it's not position 4)
- A is in position 2 -> but we know A is not in position 2 (from the feedback: A cannot be in position 2). So we cannot use a word that has A in position 2.

Therefore, ""SAUCE"" is invalid because it places A in position 2.

Another word: ""STEAD"" -> S in position 1, T in 2, E in 3, A in 4, D in 5.
Check positions:
- S: position 1 (okay, not 4)
- E: position 3 (okay, not 5)
- A: position 4 (okay, not 2)

Also, the letters: S, T, E, A, D. We know S, E, A are present. T and D are new.

But note: we have to avoid R and I, which we are.

So ""STEAD"" seems like a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""STEAK"" -> S, T, E, A, K. Similarly, positions: S1, T2, E3, A4, K5. 
- A is in 4 (not 2) -> okay
- S in 1 (not 4) -> okay
- E in 3 (not 5) -> okay

But in ""STEAD"", we have E in position 3 and A in 4. In ""STEAK"", same positions.

We could also consider ""CAUSE"": C, A, U, S, E -> 
- A in position 2 -> not allowed! Because A cannot be in position 2.

""TEASE"": T, E, A, S, E -> 
- E in position 2 (we don't know if E can be in 2? The feedback only said E is not in position 5, so it can be in 2) 
- A in position 3 (okay, not 2)
- S in position 4 -> but we must avoid S in position 4? Yes, because in the first guess S was in position 4 and it was wrong. So S cannot be in position 4. Therefore, ""TEASE"" is invalid because S is in position 4.

""LEASE"": L, E, A, S, E -> S is in position 4 -> invalid.

""OASIS"": contains I (which is absent) -> invalid.

""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A is in position 2 -> invalid.

""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> 
- S in 1 (ok)
- A in 3 (ok, not 2)
- E in 5 -> but we must avoid E in position 5? Yes, because in the first guess E was in position 5 and it was wrong. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, ""STALE"" is invalid.

""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E -> 
- S in 1 (ok)
- A in 3 (ok)
- E in 5 -> invalid.

So we need a word that has A, S, E and places:
- A not in 2
- S not in 4
- E not in 5

And the word must be valid.

Let me try to put E in position 1? Then we have E _ _ _ _

For example: ""EASTS"" -> but that has two S's and is not common. Also, S is in position 4 and 5? We have to avoid S in position 4. So ""EASTS"" has S in position 4 -> invalid.

""ESSAY"": E, S, S, A, Y -> 
- E in 1 (ok, not 5)
- S in 2 and 3? But we have two S's. The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates, so it's allowed. But we must check positions:
  - First S in position 2: we haven't tested S in position 2 -> okay (not 4)
  - Second S in position 3: also not 4 -> okay
- A in position 4: we haven't tested A in position 4 -> okay (and not 2)
- But the word has two S's. The secret word might have two S's? We don't know. It's possible.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us that S is present (but not in position 4). It didn't say how many. So the secret word might have one or more S.

Similarly, for E and A.

So ""ESSAY"" is a valid word. But let's see if we can get more information.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has new letters.

Back to ""STEAD"": 
- Positions: S1, T2, E3, A4, D5 -> 
  - S in 1: we haven't tried position 1 for S -> okay
  - T in 2: new letter, new position
  - E in 3: we haven't tried E in 3 -> okay (since E was in 5 before and was wrong, but 3 is new)
  - A in 4: we haven't tried A in 4 -> okay (A was in 2 and wrong, so 4 is new)
  - D in 5: new letter, and we know E is not in 5, but D is new so it's okay.

But wait: we know that E is in the word but not in position 5. So putting D in 5 is fine because it's a different letter.

Similarly, we know A is not in 2, but we are putting A in 4, which is fine.

So ""STEAD"" seems good.

Another option: ""STEAK"" (if we want to test K instead of D).

But let's see if we can cover more common letters. We haven't tested T, so ""STEAD"" tests T and D.

We could test other common letters like N, O, L.

For example: ""SALET"" (which is a valid word, meaning a type of helmet) -> S, A, L, E, T
- Positions: S1, A2, L3, E4, T5
But A is in position 2 -> not allowed! Because we know A is not in position 2.

""LATEST"": too long? 6 letters -> invalid.

""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> 
- A in position 2 -> invalid.

""CASTE"": C, A, S, T, E -> A in 2 -> invalid.

""BASTE"": same issue.

""HASTE"": same.

So it's tricky to avoid A in position 2 and S in 4 and E in 5.

Another word: ""TASER"" -> but R is absent, so we cannot use R.

""TASSE"": T, A, S, S, E -> 
- A in position 2 -> invalid.

""SEATS"": S, E, A, T, S -> 
- S in 1 and 5: okay (not 4)
- E in 2: okay (not 5)
- A in 3: okay (not 2)
- T in 4: new letter, new position.

So ""SEATS"": 
Position 1: S -> we know S is present, but we haven't tried it in position 1? In the first guess, S was in position 4 and was wrong. So position 1 is new.
Position 2: E -> we know E is present, and we haven't tried it in position 2 (previously in 5). So okay.
Position 3: A -> we know A is present, and we haven't tried it in position 3 (previously in 2 and wrong). So okay.
Position 4: T -> new letter.
Position 5: S -> we know S is present, and we haven't tried it in position 5. Also, we know E is not in 5, but S is different.

But note: the word has two S's. That's acceptable.

Alternatively, ""SEATS"" is a valid word.

But let me compare with ""STEAD"". Both are valid.

In ""STEAD"", we test S in 1, E in 3, A in 4, and new letters T and D.

In ""SEATS"", we test S in 1 and 5, E in 2, A in 3, and T.

We might get more information from ""SEATS"" because it has two S's? But we don't know if the secret word has two S's.

I think ""STEAD"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and doesn't duplicate letters (so if we get a hit, we know exactly which one).

But in ""STEAD"", we have unique letters: S, T, E, A, D.

In ""SEATS"", we have two S's, so if we get a feedback for S, it might be ambiguous.

Therefore, I prefer ""STEAD"".

Another word: ""STAGE"" -> S, T, A, G, E
- A in position 3: okay (not 2)
- S in 1: okay
- E in 5: but we cannot put E in 5 -> invalid.

""USAGE"": U, S, A, G, E -> 
- S in 2: okay (not 4)
- A in 3: okay
- E in 5: invalid.

So I think ""STEAD"" is a solid choice.

We could also consider ""TEACH"", but that has E in 2 and A in 3, but then we have C and H. However, we are missing S? We must include S because we know S is in the word.

We must include all the known present letters? Not necessarily, but it's efficient to test them again to find their positions.

But we know A, S, E are in the word, so if we don't include one, we might not get information about its position. However, we have 6 tries, so we can focus on two at a time? But it's better to test as many as possible.

In the second guess, we should try to test the positions of A, S, and E again, but in different positions.

Therefore, ""STEAD"" includes all three: A, S, E.

Similarly, ""SEATS"" also includes all three.

But I think ""STEAD"" is better because it has unique letters.

Another word: ""SAVED"" -> S, A, V, E, D -> 
- A in 2 -> invalid.

""AVERT"" -> has R -> invalid.

So I'll go with ""STEAD"".

But let me confirm the positions in ""STEAD"":
- S in 1: we haven't tried S in 1 -> okay
- T in 2: new letter, new position
- E in 3: we haven't tried E in 3 -> okay
- A in 4: we haven't tried A in 4 -> okay
- D in 5: new letter, and we know E is not in 5, so D is safe.

We are avoiding R and I.

So the second guess: ""STEAD""

We'll get feedback that tells us:
- For S in position 1: is it correct? (✓ or - or x? but we know S is present, so it won't be x, but it could be - if not in 1, or ✓ if correct)
- Similarly for E in 3 and A in 4.

And we test T and D.

Therefore, I choose ""STEAD"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R and I are absent (x), so they are excluded from the next guess.
- A, S, and E are present (-) but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
  - A cannot be in position 2.
  - S cannot be in position 4.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes A, S, and E (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoids R and I (since they are absent).
- Places A, S, and E in new positions to test their correct locations:
  - A not in position 2.
  - S not in position 4.
  - E not in position 5.
- Uses common letters to maximize information gain.

After evaluating options, ""STEAD"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains A, S, and E.
- It avoids R and I.
- Positions: 
  - S in 1 (new position, not 4).
  - E in 3 (new position, not 5).
  - A in 4 (new position, not 2).
- It introduces two new common letters (T and D) for testing.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A, S, and E while testing for new letters.

<guess>STEAD</guess>",STEAD,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": 
R(x) - R is not in the secret word at all.
A(-) - A is in the word but not in the second position.
I(x) - I is not in the secret word.
S(-) - S is in the word but not in the fourth position.
E(-) - E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A, S, and E, but not R or I.
- The positions: 
  - A is not in position 2 (so it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the word has 5 positions, and we know A is present but not in position 2).
  - Similarly, S is not in position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.
  - E is not in position 5, so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Also, we know that the secret word does not contain R or I.

Now, we have to make a second guess. We should try to use a word that:
- Includes the known present letters (A, S, E) in positions we haven't tried yet (to test their correct positions).
- Avoids the absent letters (R, I).
- Includes other common letters to test for presence.

We know the word has A, S, and E. Since there are 5 letters, there are two more letters we don't know.

We should try to place A, S, and E in different positions than in the first guess.

In the first guess, we had:
Position 1: R (absent)
Position 2: A (present but wrong position)
Position 3: I (absent)
Position 4: S (present but wrong position)
Position 5: E (present but wrong position)

So for the second guess, we should avoid putting A in position 2, S in position 4, and E in position 5.

We can try to put A in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don't know which one is correct. Similarly for S and E.

We also want to test new letters. Since we have three known letters (A, S, E) and two unknown, we can choose a word that has A, S, E and two new letters.

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

Let me think of words that contain A, S, E and avoid R and I.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, etc.

We can try to form a word with A, S, E and two of these.

We also want to test the positions differently.

For example, we can try:
- Put A in position 1? Then we have A _ _ _ _
- But we also have S and E to place, avoiding S in position 4 and E in position 5.

Alternatively, we can try A in position 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly for S: we can put it in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (avoiding 4).

For E: we can put it in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (avoiding 5).

Let me list some words that have A, S, E and two other letters (not R, not I).

Possible words:
- ""SAUCE"": has S, A, U, C, E -> but S is in position 1 (which is new), A in 2 (but we know A is not in position 2? No, we only know that in the first guess A was in position 2 and it was wrong, but in the secret word A might be in position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for A was (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. So A cannot be in position 2 at all. Therefore, in our new guess, we must avoid putting A in position 2.

Similarly, we must avoid S in position 4 and E in position 5.

So for ""SAUCE"":
- S is in position 1 -> okay (since we haven't tested S in position 1 and it's not position 4)
- A is in position 2 -> but we know A is not in position 2 (from the feedback: A cannot be in position 2). So we cannot use a word that has A in position 2.

Therefore, ""SAUCE"" is invalid because it places A in position 2.

Another word: ""STEAD"" -> S in position 1, T in 2, E in 3, A in 4, D in 5.
Check positions:
- S: position 1 (okay, not 4)
- E: position 3 (okay, not 5)
- A: position 4 (okay, not 2)

Also, the letters: S, T, E, A, D. We know S, E, A are present. T and D are new.

But note: we have to avoid R and I, which we are.

So ""STEAD"" seems like a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""STEAK"" -> S, T, E, A, K. Similarly, positions: S1, T2, E3, A4, K5. 
- A is in 4 (not 2) -> okay
- S in 1 (not 4) -> okay
- E in 3 (not 5) -> okay

But in ""STEAD"", we have E in position 3 and A in 4. In ""STEAK"", same positions.

We could also consider ""CAUSE"": C, A, U, S, E -> 
- A in position 2 -> not allowed! Because A cannot be in position 2.

""TEASE"": T, E, A, S, E -> 
- E in position 2 (we don't know if E can be in 2? The feedback only said E is not in position 5, so it can be in 2) 
- A in position 3 (okay, not 2)
- S in position 4 -> but we must avoid S in position 4? Yes, because in the first guess S was in position 4 and it was wrong. So S cannot be in position 4. Therefore, ""TEASE"" is invalid because S is in position 4.

""LEASE"": L, E, A, S, E -> S is in position 4 -> invalid.

""OASIS"": contains I (which is absent) -> invalid.

""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A is in position 2 -> invalid.

""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> 
- S in 1 (ok)
- A in 3 (ok, not 2)
- E in 5 -> but we must avoid E in position 5? Yes, because in the first guess E was in position 5 and it was wrong. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, ""STALE"" is invalid.

""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E -> 
- S in 1 (ok)
- A in 3 (ok)
- E in 5 -> invalid.

So we need a word that has A, S, E and places:
- A not in 2
- S not in 4
- E not in 5

And the word must be valid.

Let me try to put E in position 1? Then we have E _ _ _ _

For example: ""EASTS"" -> but that has two S's and is not common. Also, S is in position 4 and 5? We have to avoid S in position 4. So ""EASTS"" has S in position 4 -> invalid.

""ESSAY"": E, S, S, A, Y -> 
- E in 1 (ok, not 5)
- S in 2 and 3? But we have two S's. The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates, so it's allowed. But we must check positions:
  - First S in position 2: we haven't tested S in position 2 -> okay (not 4)
  - Second S in position 3: also not 4 -> okay
- A in position 4: we haven't tested A in position 4 -> okay (and not 2)
- But the word has two S's. The secret word might have two S's? We don't know. It's possible.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us that S is present (but not in position 4). It didn't say how many. So the secret word might have one or more S.

Similarly, for E and A.

So ""ESSAY"" is a valid word. But let's see if we can get more information.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has new letters.

Back to ""STEAD"": 
- Positions: S1, T2, E3, A4, D5 -> 
  - S in 1: we haven't tried position 1 for S -> okay
  - T in 2: new letter, new position
  - E in 3: we haven't tried E in 3 -> okay (since E was in 5 before and was wrong, but 3 is new)
  - A in 4: we haven't tried A in 4 -> okay (A was in 2 and wrong, so 4 is new)
  - D in 5: new letter, and we know E is not in 5, but D is new so it's okay.

But wait: we know that E is in the word but not in position 5. So putting D in 5 is fine because it's a different letter.

Similarly, we know A is not in 2, but we are putting A in 4, which is fine.

So ""STEAD"" seems good.

Another option: ""STEAK"" (if we want to test K instead of D).

But let's see if we can cover more common letters. We haven't tested T, so ""STEAD"" tests T and D.

We could test other common letters like N, O, L.

For example: ""SALET"" (which is a valid word, meaning a type of helmet) -> S, A, L, E, T
- Positions: S1, A2, L3, E4, T5
But A is in position 2 -> not allowed! Because we know A is not in position 2.

""LATEST"": too long? 6 letters -> invalid.

""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> 
- A in position 2 -> invalid.

""CASTE"": C, A, S, T, E -> A in 2 -> invalid.

""BASTE"": same issue.

""HASTE"": same.

So it's tricky to avoid A in position 2 and S in 4 and E in 5.

Another word: ""TASER"" -> but R is absent, so we cannot use R.

""TASSE"": T, A, S, S, E -> 
- A in position 2 -> invalid.

""SEATS"": S, E, A, T, S -> 
- S in 1 and 5: okay (not 4)
- E in 2: okay (not 5)
- A in 3: okay (not 2)
- T in 4: new letter, new position.

So ""SEATS"": 
Position 1: S -> we know S is present, but we haven't tried it in position 1? In the first guess, S was in position 4 and was wrong. So position 1 is new.
Position 2: E -> we know E is present, and we haven't tried it in position 2 (previously in 5). So okay.
Position 3: A -> we know A is present, and we haven't tried it in position 3 (previously in 2 and wrong). So okay.
Position 4: T -> new letter.
Position 5: S -> we know S is present, and we haven't tried it in position 5. Also, we know E is not in 5, but S is different.

But note: the word has two S's. That's acceptable.

Alternatively, ""SEATS"" is a valid word.

But let me compare with ""STEAD"". Both are valid.

In ""STEAD"", we test S in 1, E in 3, A in 4, and new letters T and D.

In ""SEATS"", we test S in 1 and 5, E in 2, A in 3, and T.

We might get more information from ""SEATS"" because it has two S's? But we don't know if the secret word has two S's.

I think ""STEAD"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and doesn't duplicate letters (so if we get a hit, we know exactly which one).

But in ""STEAD"", we have unique letters: S, T, E, A, D.

In ""SEATS"", we have two S's, so if we get a feedback for S, it might be ambiguous.

Therefore, I prefer ""STEAD"".

Another word: ""STAGE"" -> S, T, A, G, E
- A in position 3: okay (not 2)
- S in 1: okay
- E in 5: but we cannot put E in 5 -> invalid.

""USAGE"": U, S, A, G, E -> 
- S in 2: okay (not 4)
- A in 3: okay
- E in 5: invalid.

So I think ""STEAD"" is a solid choice.

We could also consider ""TEACH"", but that has E in 2 and A in 3, but then we have C and H. However, we are missing S? We must include S because we know S is in the word.

We must include all the known present letters? Not necessarily, but it's efficient to test them again to find their positions.

But we know A, S, E are in the word, so if we don't include one, we might not get information about its position. However, we have 6 tries, so we can focus on two at a time? But it's better to test as many as possible.

In the second guess, we should try to test the positions of A, S, and E again, but in different positions.

Therefore, ""STEAD"" includes all three: A, S, E.

Similarly, ""SEATS"" also includes all three.

But I think ""STEAD"" is better because it has unique letters.

Another word: ""SAVED"" -> S, A, V, E, D -> 
- A in 2 -> invalid.

""AVERT"" -> has R -> invalid.

So I'll go with ""STEAD"".

But let me confirm the positions in ""STEAD"":
- S in 1: we haven't tried S in 1 -> okay
- T in 2: new letter, new position
- E in 3: we haven't tried E in 3 -> okay
- A in 4: we haven't tried A in 4 -> okay
- D in 5: new letter, and we know E is not in 5, so D is safe.

We are avoiding R and I.

So the second guess: ""STEAD""

We'll get feedback that tells us:
- For S in position 1: is it correct? (✓ or - or x? but we know S is present, so it won't be x, but it could be - if not in 1, or ✓ if correct)
- Similarly for E in 3 and A in 4.

And we test T and D.

Therefore, I choose ""STEAD"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R and I are absent (x), so they are excluded from the next guess.
- A, S, and E are present (-) but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
  - A cannot be in position 2.
  - S cannot be in position 4.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes A, S, and E (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoids R and I (since they are absent).
- Places A, S, and E in new positions to test their correct locations:
  - A not in position 2.
  - S not in position 4.
  - E not in position 5.
- Uses common letters to maximize information gain.

After evaluating options, ""STEAD"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains A, S, and E.
- It avoids R and I.
- Positions: 
  - S in 1 (new position, not 4).
  - E in 3 (new position, not 5).
  - A in 4 (new position, not 2).
- It introduces two new common letters (T and D) for testing.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A, S, and E while testing for new letters.",Guess 2: STEAD -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) E(✓) A(✓) D(x),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. We don't have any prior information.
It's a good idea to start with a word that has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
Common starting words in word games often include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", but for this we can also consider ""ROATE"" or ""RAISE"".
However, let me pick a word that maximizes the information we get by covering frequent letters.

I think ""RAISE"" is a good choice because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also common but maybe less familiar.

But note: we must use a valid English word.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also very common.

Considering the frequencies of letters in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S.

So a word that uses as many of these as possible would be good.

I'll go with ""RAISE"": 
- R, A, I, S, E

But wait, I see that ""CRANE"" is also popular because C is common and it has the vowels.

However, without any prior information, I think ""RAISE"" is a solid choice.

Another popular starter is ""ADIEU"" to get vowels, but ADIEU only has one consonant and we can get more balanced information.

I'll go with:

<guess> RAISE </guess>For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information about the secret word. A good starting word should include common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to increase the chances of getting useful feedback. Letters like E, A, R, S, T, and I are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words. 

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it:
- Contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)
- Uses high-frequency letters that appear in many words
- Is a valid English word

This guess may reveal:
- Positionally correct letters (via ✓)
- Incorrectly placed letters (via -)
- Absent letters (via x)

The feedback will guide my next guess.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": 
R(x) - R is not in the secret word at all.
A(-) - A is in the word but not in the second position.
I(x) - I is not in the secret word.
S(-) - S is in the word but not in the fourth position.
E(-) - E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A, S, and E, but not R or I.
- The positions: 
  - A is not in position 2 (so it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the word has 5 positions, and we know A is present but not in position 2).
  - Similarly, S is not in position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.
  - E is not in position 5, so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Also, we know that the secret word does not contain R or I.

Now, we have to make a second guess. We should try to use a word that:
- Includes the known present letters (A, S, E) in positions we haven't tried yet (to test their correct positions).
- Avoids the absent letters (R, I).
- Includes other common letters to test for presence.

We know the word has A, S, and E. Since there are 5 letters, there are two more letters we don't know.

We should try to place A, S, and E in different positions than in the first guess.

In the first guess, we had:
Position 1: R (absent)
Position 2: A (present but wrong position)
Position 3: I (absent)
Position 4: S (present but wrong position)
Position 5: E (present but wrong position)

So for the second guess, we should avoid putting A in position 2, S in position 4, and E in position 5.

We can try to put A in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don't know which one is correct. Similarly for S and E.

We also want to test new letters. Since we have three known letters (A, S, E) and two unknown, we can choose a word that has A, S, E and two new letters.

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

Let me think of words that contain A, S, E and avoid R and I.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, etc.

We can try to form a word with A, S, E and two of these.

We also want to test the positions differently.

For example, we can try:
- Put A in position 1? Then we have A _ _ _ _
- But we also have S and E to place, avoiding S in position 4 and E in position 5.

Alternatively, we can try A in position 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly for S: we can put it in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (avoiding 4).

For E: we can put it in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (avoiding 5).

Let me list some words that have A, S, E and two other letters (not R, not I).

Possible words:
- ""SAUCE"": has S, A, U, C, E -> but S is in position 1 (which is new), A in 2 (but we know A is not in position 2? No, we only know that in the first guess A was in position 2 and it was wrong, but in the secret word A might be in position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for A was (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. So A cannot be in position 2 at all. Therefore, in our new guess, we must avoid putting A in position 2.

Similarly, we must avoid S in position 4 and E in position 5.

So for ""SAUCE"":
- S is in position 1 -> okay (since we haven't tested S in position 1 and it's not position 4)
- A is in position 2 -> but we know A is not in position 2 (from the feedback: A cannot be in position 2). So we cannot use a word that has A in position 2.

Therefore, ""SAUCE"" is invalid because it places A in position 2.

Another word: ""STEAD"" -> S in position 1, T in 2, E in 3, A in 4, D in 5.
Check positions:
- S: position 1 (okay, not 4)
- E: position 3 (okay, not 5)
- A: position 4 (okay, not 2)

Also, the letters: S, T, E, A, D. We know S, E, A are present. T and D are new.

But note: we have to avoid R and I, which we are.

So ""STEAD"" seems like a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""STEAK"" -> S, T, E, A, K. Similarly, positions: S1, T2, E3, A4, K5. 
- A is in 4 (not 2) -> okay
- S in 1 (not 4) -> okay
- E in 3 (not 5) -> okay

But in ""STEAD"", we have E in position 3 and A in 4. In ""STEAK"", same positions.

We could also consider ""CAUSE"": C, A, U, S, E -> 
- A in position 2 -> not allowed! Because A cannot be in position 2.

""TEASE"": T, E, A, S, E -> 
- E in position 2 (we don't know if E can be in 2? The feedback only said E is not in position 5, so it can be in 2) 
- A in position 3 (okay, not 2)
- S in position 4 -> but we must avoid S in position 4? Yes, because in the first guess S was in position 4 and it was wrong. So S cannot be in position 4. Therefore, ""TEASE"" is invalid because S is in position 4.

""LEASE"": L, E, A, S, E -> S is in position 4 -> invalid.

""OASIS"": contains I (which is absent) -> invalid.

""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A is in position 2 -> invalid.

""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> 
- S in 1 (ok)
- A in 3 (ok, not 2)
- E in 5 -> but we must avoid E in position 5? Yes, because in the first guess E was in position 5 and it was wrong. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, ""STALE"" is invalid.

""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E -> 
- S in 1 (ok)
- A in 3 (ok)
- E in 5 -> invalid.

So we need a word that has A, S, E and places:
- A not in 2
- S not in 4
- E not in 5

And the word must be valid.

Let me try to put E in position 1? Then we have E _ _ _ _

For example: ""EASTS"" -> but that has two S's and is not common. Also, S is in position 4 and 5? We have to avoid S in position 4. So ""EASTS"" has S in position 4 -> invalid.

""ESSAY"": E, S, S, A, Y -> 
- E in 1 (ok, not 5)
- S in 2 and 3? But we have two S's. The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates, so it's allowed. But we must check positions:
  - First S in position 2: we haven't tested S in position 2 -> okay (not 4)
  - Second S in position 3: also not 4 -> okay
- A in position 4: we haven't tested A in position 4 -> okay (and not 2)
- But the word has two S's. The secret word might have two S's? We don't know. It's possible.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us that S is present (but not in position 4). It didn't say how many. So the secret word might have one or more S.

Similarly, for E and A.

So ""ESSAY"" is a valid word. But let's see if we can get more information.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has new letters.

Back to ""STEAD"": 
- Positions: S1, T2, E3, A4, D5 -> 
  - S in 1: we haven't tried position 1 for S -> okay
  - T in 2: new letter, new position
  - E in 3: we haven't tried E in 3 -> okay (since E was in 5 before and was wrong, but 3 is new)
  - A in 4: we haven't tried A in 4 -> okay (A was in 2 and wrong, so 4 is new)
  - D in 5: new letter, and we know E is not in 5, but D is new so it's okay.

But wait: we know that E is in the word but not in position 5. So putting D in 5 is fine because it's a different letter.

Similarly, we know A is not in 2, but we are putting A in 4, which is fine.

So ""STEAD"" seems good.

Another option: ""STEAK"" (if we want to test K instead of D).

But let's see if we can cover more common letters. We haven't tested T, so ""STEAD"" tests T and D.

We could test other common letters like N, O, L.

For example: ""SALET"" (which is a valid word, meaning a type of helmet) -> S, A, L, E, T
- Positions: S1, A2, L3, E4, T5
But A is in position 2 -> not allowed! Because we know A is not in position 2.

""LATEST"": too long? 6 letters -> invalid.

""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> 
- A in position 2 -> invalid.

""CASTE"": C, A, S, T, E -> A in 2 -> invalid.

""BASTE"": same issue.

""HASTE"": same.

So it's tricky to avoid A in position 2 and S in 4 and E in 5.

Another word: ""TASER"" -> but R is absent, so we cannot use R.

""TASSE"": T, A, S, S, E -> 
- A in position 2 -> invalid.

""SEATS"": S, E, A, T, S -> 
- S in 1 and 5: okay (not 4)
- E in 2: okay (not 5)
- A in 3: okay (not 2)
- T in 4: new letter, new position.

So ""SEATS"": 
Position 1: S -> we know S is present, but we haven't tried it in position 1? In the first guess, S was in position 4 and was wrong. So position 1 is new.
Position 2: E -> we know E is present, and we haven't tried it in position 2 (previously in 5). So okay.
Position 3: A -> we know A is present, and we haven't tried it in position 3 (previously in 2 and wrong). So okay.
Position 4: T -> new letter.
Position 5: S -> we know S is present, and we haven't tried it in position 5. Also, we know E is not in 5, but S is different.

But note: the word has two S's. That's acceptable.

Alternatively, ""SEATS"" is a valid word.

But let me compare with ""STEAD"". Both are valid.

In ""STEAD"", we test S in 1, E in 3, A in 4, and new letters T and D.

In ""SEATS"", we test S in 1 and 5, E in 2, A in 3, and T.

We might get more information from ""SEATS"" because it has two S's? But we don't know if the secret word has two S's.

I think ""STEAD"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and doesn't duplicate letters (so if we get a hit, we know exactly which one).

But in ""STEAD"", we have unique letters: S, T, E, A, D.

In ""SEATS"", we have two S's, so if we get a feedback for S, it might be ambiguous.

Therefore, I prefer ""STEAD"".

Another word: ""STAGE"" -> S, T, A, G, E
- A in position 3: okay (not 2)
- S in 1: okay
- E in 5: but we cannot put E in 5 -> invalid.

""USAGE"": U, S, A, G, E -> 
- S in 2: okay (not 4)
- A in 3: okay
- E in 5: invalid.

So I think ""STEAD"" is a solid choice.

We could also consider ""TEACH"", but that has E in 2 and A in 3, but then we have C and H. However, we are missing S? We must include S because we know S is in the word.

We must include all the known present letters? Not necessarily, but it's efficient to test them again to find their positions.

But we know A, S, E are in the word, so if we don't include one, we might not get information about its position. However, we have 6 tries, so we can focus on two at a time? But it's better to test as many as possible.

In the second guess, we should try to test the positions of A, S, and E again, but in different positions.

Therefore, ""STEAD"" includes all three: A, S, E.

Similarly, ""SEATS"" also includes all three.

But I think ""STEAD"" is better because it has unique letters.

Another word: ""SAVED"" -> S, A, V, E, D -> 
- A in 2 -> invalid.

""AVERT"" -> has R -> invalid.

So I'll go with ""STEAD"".

But let me confirm the positions in ""STEAD"":
- S in 1: we haven't tried S in 1 -> okay
- T in 2: new letter, new position
- E in 3: we haven't tried E in 3 -> okay
- A in 4: we haven't tried A in 4 -> okay
- D in 5: new letter, and we know E is not in 5, so D is safe.

We are avoiding R and I.

So the second guess: ""STEAD""

We'll get feedback that tells us:
- For S in position 1: is it correct? (✓ or - or x? but we know S is present, so it won't be x, but it could be - if not in 1, or ✓ if correct)
- Similarly for E in 3 and A in 4.

And we test T and D.

Therefore, I choose ""STEAD"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R and I are absent (x), so they are excluded from the next guess.
- A, S, and E are present (-) but in the wrong positions. Specifically:
  - A cannot be in position 2.
  - S cannot be in position 4.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes A, S, and E (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoids R and I (since they are absent).
- Places A, S, and E in new positions to test their correct locations:
  - A not in position 2.
  - S not in position 4.
  - E not in position 5.
- Uses common letters to maximize information gain.

After evaluating options, ""STEAD"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains A, S, and E.
- It avoids R and I.
- Positions: 
  - S in 1 (new position, not 4).
  - E in 3 (new position, not 5).
  - A in 4 (new position, not 2).
- It introduces two new common letters (T and D) for testing.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A, S, and E while testing for new letters.

But note: we don\'t know which one is correct. Similarly for S and E.\n\nWe also want to test new letters. Since we have three known letters (A, S, E) and two unknown, we can choose a word that has A, S, E and two new letters.\n\nBut note: the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet me think of words that contain A, S, E and avoid R and I.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word with A, S, E and two of these.\n\nWe also want to test the positions differently.\n\nFor example, we can try:\n- Put A in position 1? Then we have A _ _ _ _\n- But we also have S and E to place, avoiding S in position 4 and E in position 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can try A in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly for S: we can put it in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (avoiding 4).\n\nFor E: we can put it in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (avoiding 5).\n\nLet me list some words that have A, S, E and two other letters (not R, not I).\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SAUCE"": has S, A, U, C, E -> but S is in position 1 (which is new), A in 2 (but we know A is not in position 2? No, we only know that in the first guess A was in position 2 and it was wrong, but in the secret word A might be in position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for A was (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. So A cannot be in position 2 at all. Therefore, in our new guess, we must avoid putting A in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid S in position 4 and E in position 5.\n\nSo for ""SAUCE"":\n- S is in position 1 -> okay (since we haven\'t tested S in position 1 and it\'s not position 4)\n- A is in position 2 -> but we know A is not in position 2 (from the feedback: A cannot be in position 2). So we cannot use a word that has A in position 2.\n\nTherefore, ""SAUCE"" is invalid because it places A in position 2.\n\nAnother word: ""STEAD"" -> S in position 1, T in 2, E in 3, A in 4, D in 5.\nCheck positions:\n- S: position 1 (okay, not 4)\n- E: position 3 (okay, not 5)\n- A: position 4 (okay, not 2)\n\nAlso, the letters: S, T, E, A, D. We know S, E, A are present. T and D are new.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid R and I, which we are.\n\nSo ""STEAD"" seems like a good candidate.\n\nAnother possibility: ""STEAK"" -> S, T, E, A, K. Similarly, positions: S1, T2, E3, A4, K5. \n- A is in 4 (not 2) -> okay\n- S in 1 (not 4) -> okay\n- E in 3 (not 5) -> okay\n\nBut in ""STEAD"", we have E in position 3 and A in 4. In ""STEAK"", same positions.\n\nWe could also consider ""CAUSE"": C, A, U, S, E -> \n- A in position 2 -> not allowed! Because A cannot be in position 2.\n\n""TEASE"": T, E, A, S, E -> \n- E in position 2 (we don\'t know if E can be in 2? The feedback only said E is not in position 5, so it can be in 2) \n- A in position 3 (okay, not 2)\n- S in position 4 -> but we must avoid S in position 4? Yes, because in the first guess S was in position 4 and it was wrong. So S cannot be in position 4. Therefore, ""TEASE"" is invalid because S is in position 4.\n\n""LEASE"": L, E, A, S, E -> S is in position 4 -> invalid.\n\n""OASIS"": contains I (which is absent) -> invalid.\n\n""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A is in position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> \n- S in 1 (ok)\n- A in 3 (ok, not 2)\n- E in 5 -> but we must avoid E in position 5? Yes, because in the first guess E was in position 5 and it was wrong. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, ""STALE"" is invalid.\n\n""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E -> \n- S in 1 (ok)\n- A in 3 (ok)\n- E in 5 -> invalid.\n\nSo we need a word that has A, S, E and places:\n- A not in 2\n- S not in 4\n- E not in 5\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\nLet me try to put E in position 1? Then we have E _ _ _ _\n\nFor example: ""EASTS"" -> but that has two S\'s and is not common. Also, S is in position 4 and 5? We have to avoid S in position 4. So ""EASTS"" has S in position 4 -> invalid.\n\n""ESSAY"": E, S, S, A, Y -> \n- E in 1 (ok, not 5)\n- S in 2 and 3? But we have two S\'s. The feedback doesn\'t say anything about duplicates, so it\'s allowed. But we must check positions:\n  - First S in position 2: we haven\'t tested S in position 2 -> okay (not 4)\n  - Second S in position 3: also not 4 -> okay\n- A in position 4: we haven\'t tested A in position 4 -> okay (and not 2)\n- But the word has two S\'s. The secret word might have two S\'s? We don\'t know. It\'s possible.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess only told us that S is present (but not in position 4). It didn\'t say how many. So the secret word might have one or more S.\n\nSimilarly, for E and A.\n\nSo ""ESSAY"" is a valid word. But let\'s see if we can get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has new letters.\n\nBack to ""STEAD"": \n- Positions: S1, T2, E3, A4, D5 -> \n  - S in 1: we haven\'t tried position 1 for S -> okay\n  - T in 2: new letter, new position\n  - E in 3: we haven\'t tried E in 3 -> okay (since E was in 5 before and was wrong, but 3 is new)\n  - A in 4: we haven\'t tried A in 4 -> okay (A was in 2 and wrong, so 4 is new)\n  - D in 5: new letter, and we know E is not in 5, but D is new so it\'s okay.\n\nBut wait: we know that E is in the word but not in position 5. So putting D in 5 is fine because it\'s a different letter.\n\nSimilarly, we know A is not in 2, but we are putting A in 4, which is fine.\n\nSo ""STEAD"" seems good.\n\nAnother option: ""STEAK"" (if we want to test K instead of D).\n\nBut let\'s see if we can cover more common letters. We haven\'t tested T, so ""STEAD"" tests T and D.\n\nWe could test other common letters like N, O, L.\n\nFor example: ""SALET"" (which is a valid word, meaning a type of helmet) -> S, A, L, E, T\n- Positions: S1, A2, L3, E4, T5\nBut A is in position 2 -> not allowed! Because we know A is not in position 2.\n\n""LATEST"": too long? 6 letters -> invalid.\n\n""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> \n- A in position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""CASTE"": C, A, S, T, E -> A in 2 -> invalid.\n\n""BASTE"": same issue.\n\n""HASTE"": same.\n\nSo it\'s tricky to avoid A in position 2 and S in 4 and E in 5.\n\nAnother word: ""TASER"" -> but R is absent, so we cannot use R.\n\n""TASSE"": T, A, S, S, E -> \n- A in position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""SEATS"": S, E, A, T, S -> \n- S in 1 and 5: okay (not 4)\n- E in 2: okay (not 5)\n- A in 3: okay (not 2)\n- T in 4: new letter, new position.\n\nSo ""SEATS"": \nPosition 1: S -> we know S is present, but we haven\'t tried it in position 1? In the first guess, S was in position 4 and was wrong. So position 1 is new.\nPosition 2: E -> we know E is present, and we haven\'t tried it in position 2 (previously in 5). So okay.\nPosition 3: A -> we know A is present, and we haven\'t tried it in position 3 (previously in 2 and wrong). So okay.\nPosition 4: T -> new letter.\nPosition 5: S -> we know S is present, and we haven\'t tried it in position 5. Also, we know E is not in 5, but S is different.\n\nBut note: the word has two S\'s. That\'s acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, ""SEATS"" is a valid word.\n\nBut let me compare with ""STEAD"". Both are valid.\n\nIn ""STEAD"", we test S in 1, E in 3, A in 4, and new letters T and D.\n\nIn ""SEATS"", we test S in 1 and 5, E in 2, A in 3, and T.\n\nWe might get more information from ""SEATS"" because it has two S\'s? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s.\n\nI think ""STEAD"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and doesn\'t duplicate letters (so if we get a hit, we know exactly which one).\n\nBut in ""STEAD"", we have unique letters: S, T, E, A, D.\n\nIn ""SEATS"", we have two S\'s, so if we get a feedback for S, it might be ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, I prefer ""STEAD"".\n\nAnother word: ""STAGE"" -> S, T, A, G, E\n- A in position 3: okay (not 2)\n- S in 1: okay\n- E in 5: but we cannot put E in 5 -> invalid.\n\n""USAGE"": U, S, A, G, E -> \n- S in 2: okay (not 4)\n- A in 3: okay\n- E in 5: invalid.\n\nSo I think ""STEAD"" is a solid choice.\n\nWe could also consider ""TEACH"", but that has E in 2 and A in 3, but then we have C and H. However, we are missing S? We must include S because we know S is in the word.\n\nWe must include all the known present letters? Not necessarily, but it\'s efficient to test them again to find their positions.\n\nBut we know A, S, E are in the word, so if we don\'t include one, we might not get information about its position. However, we have 6 tries, so we can focus on two at a time? But it\'s better to test as many as possible.\n\nIn the second guess, we should try to test the positions of A, S, and E again, but in different positions.\n\nTherefore, ""STEAD"" includes all three: A, S, E.\n\nSimilarly, ""SEATS"" also includes all three.\n\nBut I think ""STEAD"" is better because it has unique letters.\n\nAnother word: ""SAVED"" -> S, A, V, E, D -> \n- A in 2 -> invalid.\n\n""AVERT"" -> has R -> invalid.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""STEAD"".\n\nBut let me confirm the positions in ""STEAD"":\n- S in 1: we haven\'t tried S in 1 -> okay\n- T in 2: new letter, new position\n- E in 3: we haven\'t tried E in 3 -> okay\n- A in 4: we haven\'t tried A in 4 -> okay\n- D in 5: new letter, and we know E is not in 5, so D is safe.\n\nWe are avoiding R and I.\n\nSo the second guess: ""STEAD""\n\nWe\'ll get feedback that tells us:\n- For S in position 1: is it correct? (✓ or - or x? but we know S is present, so it won\'t be x, but it could be - if not in 1, or ✓ if correct)\n- Similarly for E in 3 and A in 4.\n\nAnd we test T and D.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""STEAD"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R and I are absent (x), so they are excluded from the next guess.\n- A, S, and E are present (-) but in the wrong positions.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(-), I(x), S(-), E(-)
Meaning:
- R and I are not in the word at all.
- A, S, E are in the word but not in the positions guessed: 
  - A is not in position 2.
  - S is not in position 4.
  - E is not in position 5.

Guess 2: STEAD -> S(✓), T(-), E(✓), A(✓), D(x)
Meaning:
- S is correct and in position 1 (since we got a check for S in position 1).
- E is correct and in position 3 (since we got a check for E in position 3).
- A is correct and in position 4 (since we got a check for A in position 4).
- T is in the word but not in position 2.
- D is not in the word at all.

So, from the second guess, we know:
- The secret word has S as the first letter, E as the third letter, and A as the fourth letter.
- The secret word also contains T, but not in position 2.
- D is absent.

Additionally, from the first guess, we know:
- R and I are absent.
- We already incorporated the positions for A, S, E.

Therefore, the secret word so far is: S _ E A _

We know the second and fifth letters are missing.

We also know:
- The word contains T (from the second guess, T is present but not in position 2), so T must be in either position 2 or 5? But position 2 is open, and position 5 is open. However, T is not in position 2 (as per feedback), so T must be in position 5? Or could it be in position 2? No, the feedback says T is present but not in position 2, so it must be in position 5? But wait, there are only two open positions: 2 and 5.

The word: Position 1: S, 2: ?, 3: E, 4: A, 5: ?

We know T is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, T must be in position 5. Because that's the only other position available? But wait, we don't know if T can be in position 5. Also, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

But let's confirm: the feedback for T in guess 2 was T(-) at position 2, meaning T is in the word but not in position 2. Since positions 1, 3, and 4 are fixed (S, E, A) and we know they are correct, the only other positions are 2 and 5. Therefore, T must be in position 5? But position 5 is currently unknown.

However, we must consider that T might be in a position that we haven't guessed yet? But in the current pattern, only positions 2 and 5 are open. So if T is present, it must be in position 5 because position 2 is the only other one we haven't fixed, but we know T is not in position 2. Therefore, T must be in position 5.

But wait, what if the word has T in position 5? Then the word would be S _ E A T.

But we also know that D is absent, and R and I are absent.

Now, what about the second position? We need a letter for position 2.

We know from the first guess that A, S, E are present (which we have) and R and I are absent. Also, D is absent.

So the second letter must be a letter that is not R, I, D, and also not S, E, A (because if it were S, E, or A, we might have duplicates? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. The feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we must consider the possibility.

In the first guess, we had no duplicates. In the second guess, we had no duplicates. So the secret word might not have duplicates.

But we cannot assume that. However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far.

But let's see: in the first guess, we had A, S, E present, and in the second guess we have S, E, A in fixed positions and T present. So if the secret word has, say, two S's, we wouldn't know because we only tested S in position 1 and 4 (in the first guess) and now we have S in position 1 correct. Similarly for E and A.

But in the second guess, we have S in position 1 (correct), E in 3 (correct), A in 4 (correct). So if there were duplicates, we wouldn't have been told.

However, for the purpose of guessing, we can first try without duplicates.

So, the word is: S _ E A _

We know T is present and must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 2, and 1,3,4 are fixed). Therefore, the word is S _ E A T.

Now, we need to find the second letter.

The second letter must be a letter that:
- Is not R, I, D (absent letters)
- And it must form a valid English word.

Possible words: S?EAT, where ? is a letter.

Common words: 
- SWEAT: S W E A T
- SHEET: but E is in position 3, but SHEET has E in position 3 and 4? No, SHEET is S H E E T -> but position 4 is E, but we have A in position 4. So not.
- SHEAR: but R is absent, and also position 4 is A, but SHEAR is S H E A R -> but R is absent, so invalid.
- STEAD: we already tried, and D is absent.
- SPEAR: R absent.
- SMEAR: R absent and also M? But let's list.

We need a word that ends with T: S?EAT.

Possible letters for the second position: 
- B: SBEAT? not a word.
- C: SCEAT? not a word.
- F: SFEAT? not a word.
- G: SGEAT? not a word.
- H: SHEAT? not a word, but ""SHEATH"" is 6 letters. 
- K: SKEAT? not a word.
- L: SLEAT? not a word.
- M: SMEAT? not a word, but ""SMEAR"" is not because of R and also not ending with T.
- N: SNEAT? not a word.
- P: SPEAT? not a word.
- T: STEAT? not a word, and also T is already in position 5? But if we put T in position 2, then we have two T's? But we know T is in the word, but we thought it must be in position 5. However, if we put T in position 2, but the feedback for guess 2 said T is not in position 2. So we cannot put T in position 2.

But we are considering the word S _ E A T, so the second letter is not T.

W: SWEAT -> S W E A T. This is a valid word: SWEAT.

X: SXEAT? not a word.

Y: SYEAT? not a word.

Z: SZEAT? not a word.

So the only common word I can think of is SWEAT.

But are there others?

What about ""SPLAT""? But that is S P L A T -> but position 3 is L, but we have E in position 3. So no, because position 3 must be E.

We have fixed: position 3 is E and position 4 is A. So the word must be S ? E A T.

Therefore, the only common word is SWEAT.

But let me confirm: SWEAT: S in 1, W in 2, E in 3, A in 4, T in 5.

Now, check against feedback:

From guess 1: 
- RAISE: we had A (in position 2) was present but wrong position. In SWEAT, A is in position 4, so that matches (A was not in 2).
- S was in position 4 in RAISE, but in SWEAT, S is in position 1, so S was not in 4 (which matches the feedback: S not in 4).
- E was in position 5 in RAISE, but in SWEAT, E is in position 3, so not in 5 (matches).

From guess 2: STEAD: 
- S in 1: correct (matches SWEAT).
- T in 2: in STEAD, T was in position 2 and we got T(-) meaning T is present but not in 2. In SWEAT, T is in position 5, so T is present and not in 2 (correct).
- E in 3: correct (matches).
- A in 4: correct (matches).
- D: absent, and SWEAT has no D (correct).

Also, absent letters: R, I, D are not in SWEAT.

So SWEAT seems to fit.

But is there any other possibility?

What if the word has a duplicate? For example, could there be two T's? Then T might be in position 2? But the feedback for guess 2 said T is not in position 2, so if we put T in position 2, that would be invalid. So position 2 cannot be T.

Similarly, could there be another letter that we haven't considered?

What about ""STEAT""? Not a word.

Or ""SUEAT""? Not a word.

""SWEAT"" is the only common word I know that fits.

But let me think: is there ""SKEAT""? No.

Or ""SCEAT""? No.

Therefore, I think the secret word is SWEAT.

But we are to make a guess, so we can guess SWEAT.

But note: we have to make a new guess, and if we are confident, we can guess it.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests the second position, but since we are almost sure, we can go for it.

But let me see if there is any other word that fits the pattern.

Another word: ""SHEAT"" is not a word, but ""SHEATH"" is too long.

""SPEAT"" not a word.

""CREAM"" but that has R and M, and position 3 is E? CREAM is C R E A M -> but R is absent, and position 1 is C, but we have S fixed.

No, we have position 1 fixed as S.

So I think SWEAT is the only possibility.

Therefore, we guess SWEAT.

### Analysis of Feedback and Deductions

#### Feedback Recap:
- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x), A(-), I(x), S(-), E(-)  
  - **R** and **I** are absent from the secret word.  
  - **A**, **S**, and **E** are present but in the wrong positions:  
    - A is not in position 2.  
    - S is not in position 4.  
    - E is not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: STEAD** → Feedback: S(✓), T(-), E(✓), A(✓), D(x)  
  - **S** is correct and in position 1.  
  - **E** is correct and in position 3.  
  - **A** is correct and in position 4.  
  - **T** is present but not in position 2.  
  - **D** is absent from the secret word.  

#### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 1: **S** (confirmed by ✓ in STEAD).  
   - Position 3: **E** (confirmed by ✓ in STEAD).  
   - Position 4: **A** (confirmed by ✓ in STEAD).  
   - The secret word pattern is: **S _ E A _** (positions 2 and 5 are unknown).  

2. **Present Letters**:  
   - **T** is present (from STEAD feedback: T(-)), but not in position 2.  
   - Since positions 1, 3, and 4 are fixed, **T must be in position 5** (the only remaining position).  
   - This gives the partial word: **S _ E A T**.  

3. **Absent Letters**:  
   - **R**, **I** (from RAISE feedback).  
   - **D** (from STEAD feedback).  
   - These cannot appear in the word.  

4. **Position 2 Requirements**:  
   - The second letter must:  
     - Be a valid English letter that forms a real word with ""S_EAT"".  
     - Not be **R**, **I**, **D** (absent).  
     - Not be **S**, **E**, **A**, or **T** (unless duplicated, but no evidence of duplicates so far).  
   - Common words fitting ""S _ E A T"":  
     - **SWEAT** (S-W-E-A-T) is the only common English word that matches.  
     - Other combinations (e.g., SBEAT, SCEAT, SHEAT) are invalid words.  

5. **Consistency Check**:  
   - **SWEAT** aligns with all feedback:  
     - RAISE: A (position 2) was misplaced → in SWEAT, A is in position 4 (correct).  
     - RAISE: S (position 4) was misplaced → in SWEAT, S is in position 1 (correct).  
     - RAISE: E (position 5) was misplaced → in SWEAT, E is in position 3 (correct).  
     - STEAD: T (position 2) was misplaced → in SWEAT, T is in position 5 (correct).  
     - Absent letters (R, I, D) are not in SWEAT.  

#### Conclusion:
The secret word is almost certainly **SWEAT**. This guess tests the only viable option for position 2 (W) and confirms the deduced position 5 (T). Given the constraints, no other valid words fit the pattern.

<guess>SWEAT</guess>",SWEAT,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(-), I(x), S(-), E(-)
Meaning:
- R and I are not in the word at all.
- A, S, E are in the word but not in the positions guessed: 
  - A is not in position 2.
  - S is not in position 4.
  - E is not in position 5.

Guess 2: STEAD -> S(✓), T(-), E(✓), A(✓), D(x)
Meaning:
- S is correct and in position 1 (since we got a check for S in position 1).
- E is correct and in position 3 (since we got a check for E in position 3).
- A is correct and in position 4 (since we got a check for A in position 4).
- T is in the word but not in position 2.
- D is not in the word at all.

So, from the second guess, we know:
- The secret word has S as the first letter, E as the third letter, and A as the fourth letter.
- The secret word also contains T, but not in position 2.
- D is absent.

Additionally, from the first guess, we know:
- R and I are absent.
- We already incorporated the positions for A, S, E.

Therefore, the secret word so far is: S _ E A _

We know the second and fifth letters are missing.

We also know:
- The word contains T (from the second guess, T is present but not in position 2), so T must be in either position 2 or 5? But position 2 is open, and position 5 is open. However, T is not in position 2 (as per feedback), so T must be in position 5? Or could it be in position 2? No, the feedback says T is present but not in position 2, so it must be in position 5? But wait, there are only two open positions: 2 and 5.

The word: Position 1: S, 2: ?, 3: E, 4: A, 5: ?

We know T is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, T must be in position 5. Because that's the only other position available? But wait, we don't know if T can be in position 5. Also, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

But let's confirm: the feedback for T in guess 2 was T(-) at position 2, meaning T is in the word but not in position 2. Since positions 1, 3, and 4 are fixed (S, E, A) and we know they are correct, the only other positions are 2 and 5. Therefore, T must be in position 5? But position 5 is currently unknown.

However, we must consider that T might be in a position that we haven't guessed yet? But in the current pattern, only positions 2 and 5 are open. So if T is present, it must be in position 5 because position 2 is the only other one we haven't fixed, but we know T is not in position 2. Therefore, T must be in position 5.

But wait, what if the word has T in position 5? Then the word would be S _ E A T.

But we also know that D is absent, and R and I are absent.

Now, what about the second position? We need a letter for position 2.

We know from the first guess that A, S, E are present (which we have) and R and I are absent. Also, D is absent.

So the second letter must be a letter that is not R, I, D, and also not S, E, A (because if it were S, E, or A, we might have duplicates? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. The feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we must consider the possibility.

In the first guess, we had no duplicates. In the second guess, we had no duplicates. So the secret word might not have duplicates.

But we cannot assume that. However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far.

But let's see: in the first guess, we had A, S, E present, and in the second guess we have S, E, A in fixed positions and T present. So if the secret word has, say, two S's, we wouldn't know because we only tested S in position 1 and 4 (in the first guess) and now we have S in position 1 correct. Similarly for E and A.

But in the second guess, we have S in position 1 (correct), E in 3 (correct), A in 4 (correct). So if there were duplicates, we wouldn't have been told.

However, for the purpose of guessing, we can first try without duplicates.

So, the word is: S _ E A _

We know T is present and must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 2, and 1,3,4 are fixed). Therefore, the word is S _ E A T.

Now, we need to find the second letter.

The second letter must be a letter that:
- Is not R, I, D (absent letters)
- And it must form a valid English word.

Possible words: S?EAT, where ? is a letter.

Common words: 
- SWEAT: S W E A T
- SHEET: but E is in position 3, but SHEET has E in position 3 and 4? No, SHEET is S H E E T -> but position 4 is E, but we have A in position 4. So not.
- SHEAR: but R is absent, and also position 4 is A, but SHEAR is S H E A R -> but R is absent, so invalid.
- STEAD: we already tried, and D is absent.
- SPEAR: R absent.
- SMEAR: R absent and also M? But let's list.

We need a word that ends with T: S?EAT.

Possible letters for the second position: 
- B: SBEAT? not a word.
- C: SCEAT? not a word.
- F: SFEAT? not a word.
- G: SGEAT? not a word.
- H: SHEAT? not a word, but ""SHEATH"" is 6 letters. 
- K: SKEAT? not a word.
- L: SLEAT? not a word.
- M: SMEAT? not a word, but ""SMEAR"" is not because of R and also not ending with T.
- N: SNEAT? not a word.
- P: SPEAT? not a word.
- T: STEAT? not a word, and also T is already in position 5? But if we put T in position 2, then we have two T's? But we know T is in the word, but we thought it must be in position 5. However, if we put T in position 2, but the feedback for guess 2 said T is not in position 2. So we cannot put T in position 2.

But we are considering the word S _ E A T, so the second letter is not T.

W: SWEAT -> S W E A T. This is a valid word: SWEAT.

X: SXEAT? not a word.

Y: SYEAT? not a word.

Z: SZEAT? not a word.

So the only common word I can think of is SWEAT.

But are there others?

What about ""SPLAT""? But that is S P L A T -> but position 3 is L, but we have E in position 3. So no, because position 3 must be E.

We have fixed: position 3 is E and position 4 is A. So the word must be S ? E A T.

Therefore, the only common word is SWEAT.

But let me confirm: SWEAT: S in 1, W in 2, E in 3, A in 4, T in 5.

Now, check against feedback:

From guess 1: 
- RAISE: we had A (in position 2) was present but wrong position. In SWEAT, A is in position 4, so that matches (A was not in 2).
- S was in position 4 in RAISE, but in SWEAT, S is in position 1, so S was not in 4 (which matches the feedback: S not in 4).
- E was in position 5 in RAISE, but in SWEAT, E is in position 3, so not in 5 (matches).

From guess 2: STEAD: 
- S in 1: correct (matches SWEAT).
- T in 2: in STEAD, T was in position 2 and we got T(-) meaning T is present but not in 2. In SWEAT, T is in position 5, so T is present and not in 2 (correct).
- E in 3: correct (matches).
- A in 4: correct (matches).
- D: absent, and SWEAT has no D (correct).

Also, absent letters: R, I, D are not in SWEAT.

So SWEAT seems to fit.

But is there any other possibility?

What if the word has a duplicate? For example, could there be two T's? Then T might be in position 2? But the feedback for guess 2 said T is not in position 2, so if we put T in position 2, that would be invalid. So position 2 cannot be T.

Similarly, could there be another letter that we haven't considered?

What about ""STEAT""? Not a word.

Or ""SUEAT""? Not a word.

""SWEAT"" is the only common word I know that fits.

But let me think: is there ""SKEAT""? No.

Or ""SCEAT""? No.

Therefore, I think the secret word is SWEAT.

But we are to make a guess, so we can guess SWEAT.

But note: we have to make a new guess, and if we are confident, we can guess it.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests the second position, but since we are almost sure, we can go for it.

But let me see if there is any other word that fits the pattern.

Another word: ""SHEAT"" is not a word, but ""SHEATH"" is too long.

""SPEAT"" not a word.

""CREAM"" but that has R and M, and position 3 is E? CREAM is C R E A M -> but R is absent, and position 1 is C, but we have S fixed.

No, we have position 1 fixed as S.

So I think SWEAT is the only possibility.

Therefore, we guess SWEAT.### Analysis of Feedback and Deductions
