We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So from this, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since we placed it in the second position and got '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains an R and does not contain C, A, N, or E.

 We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E
   - Contains the letter R (but not in the second position, because when we put R in the second position it was misplaced)

 Since we have only found one letter (R) so far, we want to cover other common letters.

 Let's think of remaining common consonants and vowels. The word must have R, and we know the vowel A is out, so common vowels left: O, I, U (E is also out).

 We also know the second position is not R. 

 Let's select a word that has R in it (but not in position 2) and also has other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we are trying to eliminate as many letters as possible, we should avoid repeating the letters we already know are absent (C,A,N,E) and try new letters.

 A common strategy is to use another word with several common letters. Let's consider:

 Option 1: ""ROTIS"" - but note that R is at the start, which is position 1. However, we don't know if R is in position 1 or not. Also, we haven't tried O, T, I, S.

 But wait: we must avoid putting R at position 2? Actually, the feedback told us that in our first guess R was at position 2 and was misplaced. Therefore, R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Another option: We could try a word that has R in a different position, say at the end.

 However, note that we have limited information and we want to get more coverage.

 Let me think of words that contain R and other common letters. Some possibilities:

 - ""SPORT"": contains S, P, O, R, T -> but wait, we know the word is 5 letters and we are missing information about the second and fourth letters? Actually, we don't know the positions.

 But note: the word cannot have A, E, etc.

 Another idea: ""FOURS"" - but that has four letters? No, five: F-O-U-R-S. This word has U and O (vowels) and S and F.

 However, I think we should avoid using letters that are less common. 

 Alternatively, let's consider ""STRIP"": 
   S, T, R, I, P -> R is at position 3? Actually:
   Position 1: S
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: R
   Position 4: I
   Position 5: P

 But note: we were told R is not in position 2. Here we put R in position 3. This is acceptable.

 However, we have already used C,R,A,N,E and now in ""strip"" we are using S,T,R,I,P. We haven't tried S,T,I,P.

 But wait: we already know that R is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position to get information about the position.

 However, we also want to test other letters.

 Another candidate: ""DOILY"" - but we want to include R. So we must have R.

 Let me list some words that include R and avoid C,A,N,E:

 - ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y
 - ""POURS"": P,O,U,R,S
 - ""BIRTH"": B,I,R,T,H
 - ""FIRST"": F,I,R,S,T

 We might also consider words that put R in a different position, such as:

   Position 1: R ... 
   Position 3: ... R ...
   Position 4: ... R ..
   Position 5: ... R

 Let me choose ""BIRTH"" as it has B, I, R, T, H. This way we test B, I, T, H and R (which we know is present). 

 But note: R is in the third position. We don't know if that is correct or not. Also, we haven't used these letters before.

 Alternatively, let's choose ""SPORT"": 
   S (position 1), P (position 2), O (position 3), R (position 4), T (position 5)

 But then R is in position 4. 

 However, we know R cannot be in position 2. 

 Another idea: since R can be in any position except 2, we might try to place it in a position we haven't tested. In ""crane"", we tested position 2. Now we can test, say, position 1 or position 3.

 I think ""SPORT"" is acceptable because we get to test S at position 1, P at position 2, O at position 3, R at position 4, and T at position 5.

 But note: we know P at position 2: we don't know if that's good or bad? Actually, we don't have any information about position 2 except that it isn't R.

 However, let me reconsider: we want to maximize the information. Maybe we should avoid using the letter in position 2 that we don't have constraints? Actually, we have no constraints except no R at position 2.

 But if we use a word that has R at position 1, we test a new position for R.

 After some thought, I think it might be better to use a word that has R in a different position and introduces new letters.

 Let me try ""GROUP"":
   G, R, O, U, P -> R at position 2? Wait, position 2: R -> but we must avoid putting R at position 2? Actually, in the feedback we were told that R in position 2 was misplaced. So putting R at position 2 again would be a waste? But the secret word might have R at position 2? Actually, no: because the first guess had R at position 2 and it was misplaced, meaning that R is present but not at position 2. Therefore, if we put R again at position 2 we know it will be wrong and we don't gain information.

 Therefore, we should avoid placing R in position 2.

 So in ""GROUP"": 
   Position 1: G
   Position 2: R -> we said avoid? Actually, we know R is not at position 2. Therefore, we must not put R at position 2 again.

 So let's avoid words that have R at position 2.

 Alternatively, we could put R in a position we haven't tested: say position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Another candidate: ""ROBOT"" -> R at position 1, but also R is not at the correct position? Actually the word ""ROBOT"" has two R's? Let me check: R-O-B-O-T -> only one R? Actually no, it's R-O-B-O-T, so R at position 1, and no other R. But then we have B and O and T. However, we must avoid using A? But we can use O and B and T.

 But note: we know that A is not in the word, so O is a good vowel to test.

 However, ""ROBOT"" has two O's? Actually: positions 2 and 4? -> R-O-B-O-T: positions: 1-R, 2-O, 3-B, 4-O, 5-T. That has two O's. It might be inefficient.

 Let me see: which letters have we tried? Only C,R,A,N,E. So we can use many letters.

 After considering, I think making a guess that uses R in position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5 and tests new letters. 

 Another common word is ""TRIES"": but note we are avoiding E? Because E was absent. So E cannot be used.

 So avoid any word that has C, A, N, E.

 Therefore, let me pick ""SPORT"". This word: S, P, O, R, T -> all new letters? Yes, except R.

 And we avoid E and A. We also don't use C,N.

 Also, R is at position 4? In ""SPORT"": 
   Position 1: S
   Position 2: P
   Position 3: O
   Position 4: R
   Position 5: T

 Now, if the secret word has R at position 4, we'll get a ✓ on R? Otherwise, if R is elsewhere we get a '-' or ... but wait: we know R is in the word, so we'll either get it in position 4 or we'll get a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 4.

 Also, we get to test S, P, O, and T.

 Alternatively, we could try ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L -> but then R at position 2? Wait, position 2: R -> we don't want R at position 2 because we know the secret word does not have R at position 2. So avoid.

 How about ""SHIRT"": 
   S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, R at 4, T at 5 -> R at position 4.

 This is similar to ""SPORT"".

 Or ""BIRTH"": B at 1, I at 2, R at 3, T at 4, H at 5 -> R at position 3.

 I think I'll go with ""BIRTH"" because it covers different letters: B, I, R, T, H.

 We'll see:
   If R is at position 3: ✓
   Otherwise: - (but not at position 3)

 But note: our previous guess had R at position 2 and got -, meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Now position 3: so we are testing a new position.

 Also, we are testing B at 1, I at 2, T at 4, H at 5.

 Since we don't have any information about the positions, this should be good.

 Alternatively, ""PORTY""? Not a common word.

 I think ""BIRTH"" is a valid word. 

 However, after reconsideration, I think ""SPORT"" might be better because it doesn't use I which is a vowel? Actually, I is also a vowel. 

 But let's choose ""SPORT"".

 Or what about ""STORM""?

 ""STORM"": S, T, O, R, M -> has R at position 4? 
 Position 1: S
 Position 2: T
 Position 3: O
 Position 4: R
 Position 5: M

 Also, we test S, T, O, M and R. 

 But note: ""STORM"" doesn't have the letter P, so ""SPORT"" has P and ""STORM"" doesn't. 

 Actually, both are valid.

 Maybe ""STORM"" is a better choice because T and O are more common than P? Actually, I'm not sure.

 Since we are testing position 2 with a new letter (in storm it's T, in sport it's P), I think either is good.

 I'll choose ""STORM"".

 So the second guess: ""STORM"".

 But wait, in the first guess we used ""crane"", and now ""storm"", so we are testing:

   S: position 1
   T: position 2
   O: position 3
   R: position 4
   M: position 5

 We know R is in the word, so we'll get information on where R is and we also cover S,T,O,M.

 So let's go with ""storm"".

 Therefore, the guess is ""storm"".

<guess>storm</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback for ""crane"", I know:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.
- The word contains R and excludes C, A, N, E.

For my next guess, I need:
- A 5-letter word containing R (avoiding position 2).
- New letters from unused English alphabet (avoiding C,A,N,E).
- High-information letters to narrow possibilities.

Selected ""storm"" because:
- Places R in position 4 (new position).
- Tests new common letters: S, T, O, M.
- Avoids C,A,N,E and conflicting positions.

<guess>storm</guess>",storm,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So from this, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since we placed it in the second position and got '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains an R and does not contain C, A, N, or E.

 Alternatively, let's consider ""STRIP"":

   Position 1: S
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: R
   Position 4: I

 But note: we were told R is not in position 2. Here we put R in position 3. This is acceptable.

 However, we have already used C,R,A,N,E and now in ""strip"" we are using S,T,R,I,P. We haven't tried S,T,I,P.

 - ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y

 We might also consider words that put R in a different position, such as:

   S (position 1), P (position 2), O (position 3), R (position 4), T (position 5)

 But then R is in position 4. 

 However, we know R cannot be in position 2. 

 Another idea: since R can be in any position except 2, we might try to place it in a position we haven't tested. In ""crane"", we tested position 2. Now we can test, say, position 1 or position 3.

 Let me try ""GROUP"":
   G, R, O, U, P -> R at position 2? Wait, position 2: R -> but we must avoid putting R at position 2? Actually, in the feedback we were told that R in position 2 was misplaced. So putting R at position 2 again would be a waste? But the secret word might have R at position 2?

Therefore, if we put R again at position 2 we know it will be wrong and we don't gain information.

 Therefore, we should avoid placing R in position 2.

 So in ""GROUP"": 
   Position 1: G
   Position 2: R -> we said avoid? Actually, we know R is not at position 2. Therefore, we must not put R at position 2 again.

 So let's avoid words that have R at position 2.

 Alternatively, we could put R in a position we haven't tested: say position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Another candidate: ""ROBOT"" -> R at position 1, but also R is not at the correct position? Actually the word ""ROBOT"" has two R's? Let me check: R-O-B-O-T -> only one R? Actually no, it's R-O-B-O-T, so R at position 1, and no other R. But then we have B and O and T. However, we must avoid using A? But we can use O and B and T.

 But note: we know that A is not in the word, so O is a good vowel to test.

 However, ""ROBOT"" has two O's? Actually: positions 2 and 4? -> R-O-B-O-T: positions: 1-R, 2-O, 3-B, 4-O, 5-T. That has two O's. It might be inefficient.

 Let me see: which letters have we tried? Only C,R,A,N,E. So we can use many letters.

 After considering, I think making a guess that uses R in position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5 and tests new letters. 

 Another common word is ""TRIES"": but note we are avoiding E? Because E was absent. So E cannot be used.

 So avoid any word that has C, A, N, E.

 Therefore, let me pick ""SPORT"". This word: S, P, O, R, T -> all new letters? Yes, except R.

 And we avoid E and A. We also don't use C,N.

 Also, R is at position 4? In ""SPORT"": 
   Position 1: S
   Position 2: P
   Position 3: O
   Position 4: R
   Position 5: T

 Now, if the secret word has R at position 4, we'll get a ✓ on R? Otherwise, if R is elsewhere we get a '-' or ... but wait: we know R is in the word, so we'll either get it in position 4 or we'll get a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 4.

 Alternatively, we could try ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L -> but then R at position 2? Wait, position 2: R -> we don't want R at position 2 because we know the secret word does not have R at position 2. So avoid.

 How about ""SHIRT"": 
   S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, R at 4, T at 5 -> R at position 4.

 This is similar to ""SPORT"".

 Or ""BIRTH"": B at 1, I at 2, R at 3, T at 4, H at 5 -> R at position 3.

 I think I'll go with ""BIRTH"" because it covers different letters: B, I, R, T, H.

 We'll see:
   If R is at position 3: ✓
   Otherwise: - (but not at position 3)

 But note: our previous guess had R at position 2 and got -, meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Now position 3: so we are testing a new position.

 Also, we are testing B at 1, I at 2, T at 4, H at 5.

 Since we don't have any information about the positions, this should be good.

 Alternatively, ""PORTY""? Not a common word.

 I think ""BIRTH"" is a valid word. 

 However, after reconsideration, I think ""SPORT"" might be better because it doesn't use I which is a vowel? Actually, I is also a vowel. 

 But let's choose ""SPORT"".

 Or what about ""STORM""?

 ""STORM"": S, T, O, R, M -> has R at position 4? 
 Position 1: S
 Position 2: T
 Position 3: O
 Position 4: R
 Position 5: M

 Also, we test S, T, O, M and R. 

 But note: ""STORM"" doesn't have the letter P, so ""SPORT"" has P and ""STORM"" doesn't. 

 Actually, both are valid.

 Maybe ""STORM"" is a better choice because T and O are more common than P? Actually, I'm not sure.

 Since we are testing position 2 with a new letter (in storm it's T, in sport it's P), I think either is good.

 I'll choose ""STORM"".

 So the second guess: ""STORM"".

 But wait, in the first guess we used ""crane"", and now ""storm"", so we are testing:

   S: position 1
   T: position 2
   O: position 3
   R: position 4
   M: position 5

 We know R is in the word, so we'll get information on where R is and we also cover S,T,O,M.

 So let's go with ""storm"".

 Therefore, the guess is ""storm"".

<guess>storm</guess>Based on the feedback for ""crane"", I know:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.
- The word contains R and excludes C, A, N, E.

For my next guess, I need:
- A 5-letter word containing R (avoiding position 2).
- New letters from unused English alphabet (avoiding C,A,N,E).
- High-information letters to narrow possibilities.

Selected ""storm"" because:
- Places R in position 4 (new position).
- Tests new common letters: S, T, O, M.
- Avoids C,A,N,E and conflicting positions.",Guess 2: storm -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) R(✓) M(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,STORK,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So from this, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since we placed it in the second position and got '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains an R and does not contain C, A, N, or E.

 We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E
   - Contains the letter R (but not in the second position, because when we put R in the second position it was misplaced)

 Since we have only found one letter (R) so far, we want to cover other common letters.

 Let's think of remaining common consonants and vowels. The word must have R, and we know the vowel A is out, so common vowels left: O, I, U (E is also out).

 We also know the second position is not R. 

 Let's select a word that has R in it (but not in position 2) and also has other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we are trying to eliminate as many letters as possible, we should avoid repeating the letters we already know are absent (C,A,N,E) and try new letters.

 A common strategy is to use another word with several common letters. Let's consider:

 Option 1: ""ROTIS"" - but note that R is at the start, which is position 1. However, we don't know if R is in position 1 or not. Also, we haven't tried O, T, I, S.

 But wait: we must avoid putting R at position 2? Actually, the feedback told us that in our first guess R was at position 2 and was misplaced. Therefore, R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Another option: We could try a word that has R in a different position, say at the end.

 However, note that we have limited information and we want to get more coverage.

 Let me think of words that contain R and other common letters. Some possibilities:

 - ""SPORT"": contains S, P, O, R, T -> but wait, we know the word is 5 letters and we are missing information about the second and fourth letters? Actually, we don't know the positions.

 But note: the word cannot have A, E, etc.

 Another idea: ""FOURS"" - but that has four letters? No, five: F-O-U-R-S. This word has U and O (vowels) and S and F.

 However, I think we should avoid using letters that are less common. 

 Alternatively, let's consider ""STRIP"": 
   S, T, R, I, P -> R is at position 3? Actually:
   Position 1: S
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: R
   Position 4: I
   Position 5: P

 But note: we were told R is not in position 2. Here we put R in position 3. This is acceptable.

 However, we have already used C,R,A,N,E and now in ""strip"" we are using S,T,R,I,P. We haven't tried S,T,I,P.

 But wait: we already know that R is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position to get information about the position.

 However, we also want to test other letters.

 Another candidate: ""DOILY"" - but we want to include R. So we must have R.

 Let me list some words that include R and avoid C,A,N,E:

 - ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y
 - ""POURS"": P,O,U,R,S
 - ""BIRTH"": B,I,R,T,H
 - ""FIRST"": F,I,R,S,T

 We might also consider words that put R in a different position, such as:

   Position 1: R ... 
   Position 3: ... R ...
   Position 4: ... R ..
   Position 5: ... R

 Let me choose ""BIRTH"" as it has B, I, R, T, H. This way we test B, I, T, H and R (which we know is present). 

 But note: R is in the third position. We don't know if that is correct or not. Also, we haven't used these letters before.

 Alternatively, let's choose ""SPORT"": 
   S (position 1), P (position 2), O (position 3), R (position 4), T (position 5)

 But then R is in position 4. 

 However, we know R cannot be in position 2. 

 Another idea: since R can be in any position except 2, we might try to place it in a position we haven't tested. In ""crane"", we tested position 2. Now we can test, say, position 1 or position 3.

 I think ""SPORT"" is acceptable because we get to test S at position 1, P at position 2, O at position 3, R at position 4, and T at position 5.

 But note: we know P at position 2: we don't know if that's good or bad? Actually, we don't have any information about position 2 except that it isn't R.

 However, let me reconsider: we want to maximize the information. Maybe we should avoid using the letter in position 2 that we don't have constraints? Actually, we have no constraints except no R at position 2.

 But if we use a word that has R at position 1, we test a new position for R.

 After some thought, I think it might be better to use a word that has R in a different position and introduces new letters.

 Let me try ""GROUP"":
   G, R, O, U, P -> R at position 2? Wait, position 2: R -> but we must avoid putting R at position 2? Actually, in the feedback we were told that R in position 2 was misplaced. So putting R at position 2 again would be a waste? But the secret word might have R at position 2? Actually, no: because the first guess had R at position 2 and it was misplaced, meaning that R is present but not at position 2. Therefore, if we put R again at position 2 we know it will be wrong and we don't gain information.

 Therefore, we should avoid placing R in position 2.

 So in ""GROUP"": 
   Position 1: G
   Position 2: R -> we said avoid? Actually, we know R is not at position 2. Therefore, we must not put R at position 2 again.

 So let's avoid words that have R at position 2.

 Alternatively, we could put R in a position we haven't tested: say position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Another candidate: ""ROBOT"" -> R at position 1, but also R is not at the correct position? Actually the word ""ROBOT"" has two R's? Let me check: R-O-B-O-T -> only one R? Actually no, it's R-O-B-O-T, so R at position 1, and no other R. But then we have B and O and T. However, we must avoid using A? But we can use O and B and T.

 But note: we know that A is not in the word, so O is a good vowel to test.

 However, ""ROBOT"" has two O's? Actually: positions 2 and 4? -> R-O-B-O-T: positions: 1-R, 2-O, 3-B, 4-O, 5-T. That has two O's. It might be inefficient.

 Let me see: which letters have we tried? Only C,R,A,N,E. So we can use many letters.

 After considering, I think making a guess that uses R in position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5 and tests new letters. 

 Another common word is ""TRIES"": but note we are avoiding E? Because E was absent. So E cannot be used.

 So avoid any word that has C, A, N, E.

 Therefore, let me pick ""SPORT"". This word: S, P, O, R, T -> all new letters? Yes, except R.

 And we avoid E and A. We also don't use C,N.

 Also, R is at position 4? In ""SPORT"": 
   Position 1: S
   Position 2: P
   Position 3: O
   Position 4: R
   Position 5: T

 Now, if the secret word has R at position 4, we'll get a ✓ on R? Otherwise, if R is elsewhere we get a '-' or ... but wait: we know R is in the word, so we'll either get it in position 4 or we'll get a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 4.

 Also, we get to test S, P, O, and T.

 Alternatively, we could try ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L -> but then R at position 2? Wait, position 2: R -> we don't want R at position 2 because we know the secret word does not have R at position 2. So avoid.

 How about ""SHIRT"": 
   S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, R at 4, T at 5 -> R at position 4.

 This is similar to ""SPORT"".

 Or ""BIRTH"": B at 1, I at 2, R at 3, T at 4, H at 5 -> R at position 3.

 I think I'll go with ""BIRTH"" because it covers different letters: B, I, R, T, H.

 We'll see:
   If R is at position 3: ✓
   Otherwise: - (but not at position 3)

 But note: our previous guess had R at position 2 and got -, meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Now position 3: so we are testing a new position.

 Also, we are testing B at 1, I at 2, T at 4, H at 5.

 Since we don't have any information about the positions, this should be good.

 Alternatively, ""PORTY""? Not a common word.

 I think ""BIRTH"" is a valid word. 

 However, after reconsideration, I think ""SPORT"" might be better because it doesn't use I which is a vowel? Actually, I is also a vowel. 

 But let's choose ""SPORT"".

 Or what about ""STORM""?

 ""STORM"": S, T, O, R, M -> has R at position 4? 
 Position 1: S
 Position 2: T
 Position 3: O
 Position 4: R
 Position 5: M

 Also, we test S, T, O, M and R. 

 But note: ""STORM"" doesn't have the letter P, so ""SPORT"" has P and ""STORM"" doesn't. 

 Actually, both are valid.

 Maybe ""STORM"" is a better choice because T and O are more common than P? Actually, I'm not sure.

 Since we are testing position 2 with a new letter (in storm it's T, in sport it's P), I think either is good.

 I'll choose ""STORM"".

 So the second guess: ""STORM"".

 But wait, in the first guess we used ""crane"", and now ""storm"", so we are testing:

   S: position 1
   T: position 2
   O: position 3
   R: position 4
   M: position 5

 We know R is in the word, so we'll get information on where R is and we also cover S,T,O,M.

 So let's go with ""storm"".

 Therefore, the guess is ""storm"".

<guess>storm</guess>Based on the feedback for ""crane"", I know:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

Meaning:
  - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was misplaced at position 2).
  - C, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: storm -> S(✓), T(✓), O(✓), R(✓), M(x)
Meaning:
  - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1: because in ""storm"", S is first and got ✓).
  - T is correct and in position (position 2: because T is second and got ✓).
  - O is correct and in position (position 3: because O is third and got ✓).
  - R is correct and in position (position 4: because R is fourth and got ✓).
  - M is absent.

So from the feedback of ""storm"", we know:
  The secret word has letters S, T, O, R in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively, and the fifth letter is not M.

Also, from guess 1, we know that the secret word contains R, which we now know is in position 4. Also, C, A, N, E, M are absent.

Therefore, the secret word is: S T O R ? (with the fifth letter unknown, and excluding M and also excluding C, A, N, E).

So the word must be of the form: S T O R _ 

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""STOR"" and ends with some letter that is not M, C, A, N, E.

Possible words:
  - store
  - stork
  - storm (but M is absent, so ruled out)
  - story
  - stour (which is a word, meaning a strong wind or a commotion)
  - stowp (less common)

But we need to check against previous feedback:

In guess 1: ""crane"", we have R at position 2 was misplaced. But in our current deduced word, R is at position 4. That is consistent because R is not at position 2.

Now, the fifth letter:
  - Must not be M (from ""storm"" feedback).
  - Must not be C, A, N, E (from ""crane"" feedback).

So possible letters: any English letter except C, A, N, E, M.

But the word must be valid.

Let's list some candidates:
  - store: letter E -> but E was absent in ""crane"", so E is not in the word? Actually, recall ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was absent. Therefore, E is not in the word. So ""store"" must be ruled out? Let's see:

The feedback for ""crane"": E at position 5 was absent (x). So the secret word does not contain E. Therefore, ""store"" has an E, so it's invalid.

Similarly, ""story"": ends with Y. Y is allowed because we don't have information about Y.

""stork"": ends with K. K is not excluded.

""stour"": ends with U. We don't have information about U, so it might be present? But ""stour"" is a word.

""stowp"": ends with P. Also an option.

However, we must check: In ""crane"", we know that the only letter that was present was R. We now know the secret word has S, T, O, R, and one more letter. That letter must not be any of the absent letters: C,A,N,E,M.

Also, it must not be R? But wait, the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say anything against duplicates. However, in ""storm"" we had only one M which was absent, so if the word had two R's? But our feedback from ""storm"": we have R at position 4 is correct. And in ""crane"" we had R at position 2 which was misplaced. But if the word has two R's, it would have been indicated? Actually, the feedback only tells us about each instance.

But in ""storm"", if the word had another R somewhere else, it would have shown up as ✓ or - for that position? We don't know because we haven't tested.

But in this case, our word pattern is fixed as positions 1,2,3,4: S,T,O,R. Only position 5 is variable.

The fifth letter must be an English letter forming a valid word.

List of possible words ending with STOR_:
 - stora: but not common, might be a proper noun? Probably not.
 - stork: valid, means a bird.
 - storm: not possible because M is absent.
 - story: valid, meaning a tale.
 - stour: valid, meaning a strong wind or stir, especially in UK English.
 - stowp: less common, variant of stoup? But Wordle usually uses common words.

Also, are there others? Like ""stopt""? Past tense? Not common. ""stogy""? Also written as ""stogie"", but that is 5 letters: stogy.

So common ones: stork, story, stour? 

But we must verify:

In ""crane"" we had R present but in the wrong position. In our pattern, R is at position 4. Could there be another R? For example, in ""story"": there is only one R? Yes: S-T-O-R-Y -> R at position 4. So that matches.

Similarly, ""stork"": S-T-O-R-K -> one R.

In ""crane"", we had R at position 2 (which was wrong) and since the word actually has R only at position 4, that explains why it was marked '-' (present but not at that position).

Now, which one to choose? We have three possibilities: stork, story, stour.

We also have not tried K, Y, U.

We can guess one and if wrong, we have more tries. But we have 6 tries total and we are on the third guess.

Alternatively, we can make a guess that includes multiple options? But we don't have that because the pattern is fixed: STOR?
Actually, the fifth letter must be one letter.

Since we have limited possibilities, we can guess one of them.

Let's see: common words: both story and stork are common. Stour is less common.

We can also think of other feedback: none.

But we tested the letter M and it was absent. So if we choose ""stork"", we test K. Even if it's not the word, we get information? But actually, we are guessing the word.

Alternatively, let's consider that we have ruled out several letters: C,A,N,E,M. We also know S,T,O,R are present and in position.

We need to select a word: either stork or story.

But story: has Y. Is Y a vowel? Common? It exists.

stork: K is a consonant.

We can also consider ""straw""? But that doesn't fit: STRAW -> positions: 1:S, 2:T? No, S T R A W doesn't match because we need S at 1, T at 2, then O at 3? but straw has R at position 3? So it's STRAW -> S at 1, T at 2, R at 3? Not O at 3.

Therefore, it must be STOR? so only the last letter varies.

We'll choose ""stork"" because it's common and tests K.

Another candidate: ""store"" is ruled out because of E.

So:

  Possible: stork (K), story (Y), stour (U)

My decision: We'll guess ""stork"". 

Why? Maybe ""story"" is more common? Both are valid. Let's choose ""story"", but note: if we guess ""story"", and it's wrong, we know that the last letter is not Y? Then we can guess stork or stour. Similarly, if we guess stork first and wrong, we rule out K.

But since it's third guess, I'll start with ""story""?

Wait: we have no other information. We should guess one. As a statistical likelihood, ""story"" might be more common? But Wordle words are curated, both are possible.

In the previous feedback, we had no other letters, so either choice is fine.

I'll go with ""story"" because it's a very common word.

So guess: ""story""

But first, let me check the feedback again: in the second guess with ""storm"", M was absent. So ""story"" does not include M? It doesn't, so okay.

But ""story"" doesn't have M? The letters of story: S,T,O,R,Y -> no M.

Therefore, we can guess ""story"".

But note: the feedback from ""crane"": we had A absent? Yes, so no A in story? There is no A.

Also, E absent? So no E.

So we are safe.

Therefore, the guess: ""story""

Alternatively, to confirm: STOR? Yes, and ? = Y.

So let's guess ""story"".

But wait: we have already used the letter O? And we know it is correct? So no problem.

Therefore, the next guess is ""story"".

However, note that the secret word might be ""stour"", but we'll get feedback.

But I'll choose ""story"".

So: <guess>story</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": R is in the word (but not in position 2), and C, A, N, E are absent.
- From ""storm"": S, T, O, R are correct and in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively, and M is absent.

The secret word is **S T O R ?** where the fifth letter:
- Must form a valid English word.
- Cannot be M, C, A, N, E (from previous feedback).
- Possible candidates include common words like ""stork"", ""story"", or ""stour"".

Since ""story"" is a frequent 5-letter English word ending in Y (a letter not yet ruled out), and it fits the known constraints (positions 1-4: S,T,O,R), it is a strong candidate. Guessing ""story"" will confirm if Y is the fifth letter or provide information about other possibilities like ""stork"" or ""stour"".

<guess>story</guess>",story,"We have two guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
  - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was misplaced at position 2).
  - C, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: storm -> S(✓), T(✓), O(✓), R(✓), M(x)
Meaning:
  - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1: because in ""storm"", S is first and got ✓).
  - T is correct and in position (position 2: because T is second and got ✓).
  - O is correct and in position (position 3: because O is third and got ✓).
  - R is correct and in position (position 4: because R is fourth and got ✓).
  - M is absent.

So from the feedback of ""storm"", we know:
  The secret word has letters S, T, O, R in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively, and the fifth letter is not M.

Also, from guess 1, we know that the secret word contains R, which we now know is in position 4. Also, C, A, N, E, M are absent.

Therefore, the secret word is: S T O R ? (with the fifth letter unknown, and excluding M and also excluding C, A, N, E).

So the word must be of the form: S T O R _ 

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""STOR"" and ends with some letter that is not M, C, A, N, E.

Possible words:
  - store
  - stork
  - storm (but M is absent, so ruled out)
  - story
  - stour (which is a word, meaning a strong wind or a commotion)

 - stork: valid, means a bird.

Therefore, it must be STOR? so only the last letter varies.

We'll choose ""stork"" because it's common and tests K.

Another candidate: ""store"" is ruled out because of E.

So:

  Possible: stork (K), story (Y), stour (U)

My decision: We'll guess ""stork"". 

Why? Maybe ""story"" is more common? Both are valid. Let's choose ""story"", but note: if we guess ""story"", and it's wrong, we know that the last letter is not Y? Then we can guess stork or stour. Similarly, if we guess stork first and wrong, we rule out K.

But ""story"" doesn't have M? The letters of story: S,T,O,R,Y -> no M.

Therefore, we can guess ""story"".

Also, E absent? So no E.

So we are safe.

Therefore, the guess: ""story""

Alternatively, to confirm: STOR? Yes, and ? = Y.

So let's guess ""story"".

But wait: we have already used the letter O? And we know it is correct? So no problem.

Therefore, the next guess is ""story"".

However, note that the secret word might be ""stour"", but we'll get feedback.

But I'll choose ""story"".

So: <guess>story</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": R is in the word (but not in position 2), and C, A, N, E are absent.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,STORK,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So from this, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since we placed it in the second position and got '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains an R and does not contain C, A, N, or E.

 We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E
   - Contains the letter R (but not in the second position, because when we put R in the second position it was misplaced)

 Since we have only found one letter (R) so far, we want to cover other common letters.

 Let's think of remaining common consonants and vowels. The word must have R, and we know the vowel A is out, so common vowels left: O, I, U (E is also out).

 We also know the second position is not R. 

 Let's select a word that has R in it (but not in position 2) and also has other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we are trying to eliminate as many letters as possible, we should avoid repeating the letters we already know are absent (C,A,N,E) and try new letters.

 A common strategy is to use another word with several common letters. Let's consider:

 Option 1: ""ROTIS"" - but note that R is at the start, which is position 1. However, we don't know if R is in position 1 or not. Also, we haven't tried O, T, I, S.

 But wait: we must avoid putting R at position 2? Actually, the feedback told us that in our first guess R was at position 2 and was misplaced. Therefore, R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Another option: We could try a word that has R in a different position, say at the end.

 However, note that we have limited information and we want to get more coverage.

 Let me think of words that contain R and other common letters. Some possibilities:

 - ""SPORT"": contains S, P, O, R, T -> but wait, we know the word is 5 letters and we are missing information about the second and fourth letters? Actually, we don't know the positions.

 But note: the word cannot have A, E, etc.

 Another idea: ""FOURS"" - but that has four letters? No, five: F-O-U-R-S. This word has U and O (vowels) and S and F.

 However, I think we should avoid using letters that are less common. 

 Alternatively, let's consider ""STRIP"": 
   S, T, R, I, P -> R is at position 3? Actually:
   Position 1: S
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: R
   Position 4: I
   Position 5: P

 But note: we were told R is not in position 2. Here we put R in position 3. This is acceptable.

 However, we have already used C,R,A,N,E and now in ""strip"" we are using S,T,R,I,P. We haven't tried S,T,I,P.

 But wait: we already know that R is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position to get information about the position.

 However, we also want to test other letters.

 Another candidate: ""DOILY"" - but we want to include R. So we must have R.

 Let me list some words that include R and avoid C,A,N,E:

 - ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y
 - ""POURS"": P,O,U,R,S
 - ""BIRTH"": B,I,R,T,H
 - ""FIRST"": F,I,R,S,T

 We might also consider words that put R in a different position, such as:

   Position 1: R ... 
   Position 3: ... R ...
   Position 4: ... R ..
   Position 5: ... R

 Let me choose ""BIRTH"" as it has B, I, R, T, H. This way we test B, I, T, H and R (which we know is present). 

 But note: R is in the third position. We don't know if that is correct or not. Also, we haven't used these letters before.

 Alternatively, let's choose ""SPORT"": 
   S (position 1), P (position 2), O (position 3), R (position 4), T (position 5)

 But then R is in position 4. 

 However, we know R cannot be in position 2. 

 Another idea: since R can be in any position except 2, we might try to place it in a position we haven't tested. In ""crane"", we tested position 2. Now we can test, say, position 1 or position 3.

 I think ""SPORT"" is acceptable because we get to test S at position 1, P at position 2, O at position 3, R at position 4, and T at position 5.

 But note: we know P at position 2: we don't know if that's good or bad? Actually, we don't have any information about position 2 except that it isn't R.

 However, let me reconsider: we want to maximize the information. Maybe we should avoid using the letter in position 2 that we don't have constraints? Actually, we have no constraints except no R at position 2.

 But if we use a word that has R at position 1, we test a new position for R.

 After some thought, I think it might be better to use a word that has R in a different position and introduces new letters.

 Let me try ""GROUP"":
   G, R, O, U, P -> R at position 2? Wait, position 2: R -> but we must avoid putting R at position 2? Actually, in the feedback we were told that R in position 2 was misplaced. So putting R at position 2 again would be a waste? But the secret word might have R at position 2? Actually, no: because the first guess had R at position 2 and it was misplaced, meaning that R is present but not at position 2. Therefore, if we put R again at position 2 we know it will be wrong and we don't gain information.

 Therefore, we should avoid placing R in position 2.

 So in ""GROUP"": 
   Position 1: G
   Position 2: R -> we said avoid? Actually, we know R is not at position 2. Therefore, we must not put R at position 2 again.

 So let's avoid words that have R at position 2.

 Alternatively, we could put R in a position we haven't tested: say position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Another candidate: ""ROBOT"" -> R at position 1, but also R is not at the correct position? Actually the word ""ROBOT"" has two R's? Let me check: R-O-B-O-T -> only one R? Actually no, it's R-O-B-O-T, so R at position 1, and no other R. But then we have B and O and T. However, we must avoid using A? But we can use O and B and T.

 But note: we know that A is not in the word, so O is a good vowel to test.

 However, ""ROBOT"" has two O's? Actually: positions 2 and 4? -> R-O-B-O-T: positions: 1-R, 2-O, 3-B, 4-O, 5-T. That has two O's. It might be inefficient.

 Let me see: which letters have we tried? Only C,R,A,N,E. So we can use many letters.

 After considering, I think making a guess that uses R in position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5 and tests new letters. 

 Another common word is ""TRIES"": but note we are avoiding E? Because E was absent. So E cannot be used.

 So avoid any word that has C, A, N, E.

 Therefore, let me pick ""SPORT"". This word: S, P, O, R, T -> all new letters? Yes, except R.

 And we avoid E and A. We also don't use C,N.

 Also, R is at position 4? In ""SPORT"": 
   Position 1: S
   Position 2: P
   Position 3: O
   Position 4: R
   Position 5: T

 Now, if the secret word has R at position 4, we'll get a ✓ on R? Otherwise, if R is elsewhere we get a '-' or ... but wait: we know R is in the word, so we'll either get it in position 4 or we'll get a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 4.

 Also, we get to test S, P, O, and T.

 Alternatively, we could try ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L -> but then R at position 2? Wait, position 2: R -> we don't want R at position 2 because we know the secret word does not have R at position 2. So avoid.

 How about ""SHIRT"": 
   S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, R at 4, T at 5 -> R at position 4.

 This is similar to ""SPORT"".

 Or ""BIRTH"": B at 1, I at 2, R at 3, T at 4, H at 5 -> R at position 3.

 I think I'll go with ""BIRTH"" because it covers different letters: B, I, R, T, H.

 We'll see:
   If R is at position 3: ✓
   Otherwise: - (but not at position 3)

 But note: our previous guess had R at position 2 and got -, meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Now position 3: so we are testing a new position.

 Also, we are testing B at 1, I at 2, T at 4, H at 5.

 Since we don't have any information about the positions, this should be good.

 Alternatively, ""PORTY""? Not a common word.

 I think ""BIRTH"" is a valid word. 

 However, after reconsideration, I think ""SPORT"" might be better because it doesn't use I which is a vowel? Actually, I is also a vowel. 

 But let's choose ""SPORT"".

 Or what about ""STORM""?

 ""STORM"": S, T, O, R, M -> has R at position 4? 
 Position 1: S
 Position 2: T
 Position 3: O
 Position 4: R
 Position 5: M

 Also, we test S, T, O, M and R. 

 But note: ""STORM"" doesn't have the letter P, so ""SPORT"" has P and ""STORM"" doesn't. 

 Actually, both are valid.

 Maybe ""STORM"" is a better choice because T and O are more common than P? Actually, I'm not sure.

 Since we are testing position 2 with a new letter (in storm it's T, in sport it's P), I think either is good.

 I'll choose ""STORM"".

 So the second guess: ""STORM"".

 But wait, in the first guess we used ""crane"", and now ""storm"", so we are testing:

   S: position 1
   T: position 2
   O: position 3
   R: position 4
   M: position 5

 We know R is in the word, so we'll get information on where R is and we also cover S,T,O,M.

 So let's go with ""storm"".

 Therefore, the guess is ""storm"".

<guess>storm</guess>Based on the feedback for ""crane"", I know:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.
- The word contains R and excludes C, A, N, E.

For my next guess, I need:
- A 5-letter word containing R (avoiding position 2).
- New letters from unused English alphabet (avoiding C,A,N,E).
- High-information letters to narrow possibilities.

Selected ""storm"" because:
- Places R in position 4 (new position).
- Tests new common letters: S, T, O, M.
- Avoids C,A,N,E and conflicting positions.

<guess>storm</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: storm -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) R(✓) M(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
  - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was misplaced at position 2).
  - C, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: storm -> S(✓), T(✓), O(✓), R(✓), M(x)
Meaning:
  - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1: because in ""storm"", S is first and got ✓).
  - T is correct and in position (position 2: because T is second and got ✓).
  - O is correct and in position (position 3: because O is third and got ✓).
  - R is correct and in position (position 4: because R is fourth and got ✓).
  - M is absent.

So from the feedback of ""storm"", we know:
  The secret word has letters S, T, O, R in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively, and the fifth letter is not M.

Also, from guess 1, we know that the secret word contains R, which we now know is in position 4. Also, C, A, N, E, M are absent.

Therefore, the secret word is: S T O R ? (with the fifth letter unknown, and excluding M and also excluding C, A, N, E).

So the word must be of the form: S T O R _ 

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""STOR"" and ends with some letter that is not M, C, A, N, E.

Possible words:
  - store
  - stork
  - storm (but M is absent, so ruled out)
  - story
  - stour (which is a word, meaning a strong wind or a commotion)
  - stowp (less common)

But we need to check against previous feedback:

In guess 1: ""crane"", we have R at position 2 was misplaced. But in our current deduced word, R is at position 4. That is consistent because R is not at position 2.

Now, the fifth letter:
  - Must not be M (from ""storm"" feedback).
  - Must not be C, A, N, E (from ""crane"" feedback).

So possible letters: any English letter except C, A, N, E, M.

But the word must be valid.

Let's list some candidates:
  - store: letter E -> but E was absent in ""crane"", so E is not in the word? Actually, recall ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was absent. Therefore, E is not in the word. So ""store"" must be ruled out? Let's see:

The feedback for ""crane"": E at position 5 was absent (x). So the secret word does not contain E. Therefore, ""store"" has an E, so it's invalid.

Similarly, ""story"": ends with Y. Y is allowed because we don't have information about Y.

""stork"": ends with K. K is not excluded.

""stour"": ends with U. We don't have information about U, so it might be present? But ""stour"" is a word.

""stowp"": ends with P. Also an option.

However, we must check: In ""crane"", we know that the only letter that was present was R. We now know the secret word has S, T, O, R, and one more letter. That letter must not be any of the absent letters: C,A,N,E,M.

Also, it must not be R? But wait, the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say anything against duplicates. However, in ""storm"" we had only one M which was absent, so if the word had two R's? But our feedback from ""storm"": we have R at position 4 is correct. And in ""crane"" we had R at position 2 which was misplaced. But if the word has two R's, it would have been indicated? Actually, the feedback only tells us about each instance.

But in ""storm"", if the word had another R somewhere else, it would have shown up as ✓ or - for that position? We don't know because we haven't tested.

But in this case, our word pattern is fixed as positions 1,2,3,4: S,T,O,R. Only position 5 is variable.

The fifth letter must be an English letter forming a valid word.

List of possible words ending with STOR_:
 - stora: but not common, might be a proper noun? Probably not.
 - stork: valid, means a bird.
 - storm: not possible because M is absent.
 - story: valid, meaning a tale.
 - stour: valid, meaning a strong wind or stir, especially in UK English.
 - stowp: less common, variant of stoup? But Wordle usually uses common words.

Also, are there others? Like ""stopt""? Past tense? Not common. ""stogy""? Also written as ""stogie"", but that is 5 letters: stogy.

So common ones: stork, story, stour? 

But we must verify:

In ""crane"" we had R present but in the wrong position. In our pattern, R is at position 4. Could there be another R? For example, in ""story"": there is only one R? Yes: S-T-O-R-Y -> R at position 4. So that matches.

Similarly, ""stork"": S-T-O-R-K -> one R.

In ""crane"", we had R at position 2 (which was wrong) and since the word actually has R only at position 4, that explains why it was marked '-' (present but not at that position).

Now, which one to choose? We have three possibilities: stork, story, stour.

We also have not tried K, Y, U.

We can guess one and if wrong, we have more tries. But we have 6 tries total and we are on the third guess.

Alternatively, we can make a guess that includes multiple options? But we don't have that because the pattern is fixed: STOR?
Actually, the fifth letter must be one letter.

Since we have limited possibilities, we can guess one of them.

Let's see: common words: both story and stork are common. Stour is less common.

We can also think of other feedback: none.

But we tested the letter M and it was absent. So if we choose ""stork"", we test K. Even if it's not the word, we get information? But actually, we are guessing the word.

Alternatively, let's consider that we have ruled out several letters: C,A,N,E,M. We also know S,T,O,R are present and in position.

We need to select a word: either stork or story.

But story: has Y. Is Y a vowel? Common? It exists.

stork: K is a consonant.

We can also consider ""straw""? But that doesn't fit: STRAW -> positions: 1:S, 2:T? No, S T R A W doesn't match because we need S at 1, T at 2, then O at 3? but straw has R at position 3? So it's STRAW -> S at 1, T at 2, R at 3? Not O at 3.

Therefore, it must be STOR? so only the last letter varies.

We'll choose ""stork"" because it's common and tests K.

Another candidate: ""store"" is ruled out because of E.

So:

  Possible: stork (K), story (Y), stour (U)

My decision: We'll guess ""stork"". 

Why? Maybe ""story"" is more common? Both are valid. Let's choose ""story"", but note: if we guess ""story"", and it's wrong, we know that the last letter is not Y? Then we can guess stork or stour. Similarly, if we guess stork first and wrong, we rule out K.

But since it's third guess, I'll start with ""story""?

Wait: we have no other information. We should guess one. As a statistical likelihood, ""story"" might be more common? But Wordle words are curated, both are possible.

In the previous feedback, we had no other letters, so either choice is fine.

I'll go with ""story"" because it's a very common word.

So guess: ""story""

But first, let me check the feedback again: in the second guess with ""storm"", M was absent. So ""story"" does not include M? It doesn't, so okay.

But ""story"" doesn't have M? The letters of story: S,T,O,R,Y -> no M.

Therefore, we can guess ""story"".

But note: the feedback from ""crane"": we had A absent? Yes, so no A in story? There is no A.

Also, E absent? So no E.

So we are safe.

Therefore, the guess: ""story""

Alternatively, to confirm: STOR? Yes, and ? = Y.

So let's guess ""story"".

But wait: we have already used the letter O? And we know it is correct? So no problem.

Therefore, the next guess is ""story"".

However, note that the secret word might be ""stour"", but we'll get feedback.

But I'll choose ""story"".

So: <guess>story</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": R is in the word (but not in position 2), and C, A, N, E are absent.
- From ""storm"": S, T, O, R are correct and in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively, and M is absent.

The secret word is **S T O R ?** where the fifth letter:
- Must form a valid English word.
- Cannot be M, C, A, N, E (from previous feedback).
- Possible candidates include common words like ""stork"", ""story"", or ""stour"".

Since ""story"" is a frequent 5-letter English word ending in Y (a letter not yet ruled out), and it fits the known constraints (positions 1-4: S,T,O,R), it is a strong candidate. Guessing ""story"" will confirm if Y is the fifth letter or provide information about other possibilities like ""stork"" or ""stour"".

Actually, we don\'t know the positions.\n\n But note: the word cannot have A, E, etc.\n\n Another idea: ""FOURS"" - but that has four letters? No, five: F-O-U-R-S. This word has U and O (vowels) and S and F.\n\n However, I think we should avoid using letters that are less common. \n\n Alternatively, let\'s consider ""STRIP"": \n   S, T, R, I, P -> R is at position 3?

So we must have R.\n\n Let me list some words that include R and avoid C,A,N,E:\n\n - ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y\n - ""POURS"": P,O,U,R,S\n - ""BIRTH"": B,I,R,T,H\n - ""FIRST"": F,I,R,S,T\n\n We might also consider words that put R in a different position, such as:\n\n   Position 1: R ... \n   Position 3: ... R ...\n   Position 4: ... R ..\n   Position 5: ... R\n\n Let me choose ""BIRTH"" as it has B, I, R, T, H. This way we test B, I, T, H and R (which we know is present). \n\n But note: R is in the third position. We don\'t know if that is correct or not. Also, we haven\'t used these letters before.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s choose ""SPORT"": \n   S (position 1), P (position 2), O (position 3), R (position 4), T (position 5)\n\n But then R is in position 4. \n\n However, we know R cannot be in position 2. \n\n Another idea: since R can be in any position except 2, we might try to place it in a position we haven\'t tested. In ""crane"", we tested position 2. Now we can test, say, position 1 or position 3.\n\n I think ""SPORT"" is acceptable because we get to test S at position 1, P at position 2, O at position 3, R at position 4, and T at position 5.\n\n But note: we know P at position 2: we don\'t know if that\'s good or bad? Actually, we don\'t have any information about position 2 except that it isn\'t R.\n\n However, let me reconsider: we want to maximize the information. Maybe we should avoid using the letter in position 2 that we don\'t have constraints? Actually, we have no constraints except no R at position 2.\n\n But if we use a word that has R at position 1, we test a new position for R.\n\n After some thought, I think it might be better to use a word that has R in a different position and introduces new letters.\n\n Let me try ""GROUP"":\n   G, R, O, U, P -> R at position 2? Wait, position 2: R -> but we must avoid putting R at position 2? Actually, in the feedback we were told that R in position 2 was misplaced. So putting R at position 2 again would be a waste? But the secret word might have R at position 2? Actually, no: because the first guess had R at position 2 and it was misplaced, meaning that R is present but not at position 2. Therefore, if we put R again at position 2 we know it will be wrong and we don\'t gain information.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid placing R in position 2.\n\n So in ""GROUP"": \n   Position 1: G\n   Position 2: R -> we said avoid? Actually, we know R is not at position 2. Therefore, we must not put R at position 2 again.\n\n So let\'s avoid words that have R at position 2.\n\n Alternatively, we could put R in a position we haven\'t tested: say position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Another candidate: ""ROBOT"" -> R at position 1, but also R is not at the correct position? Actually the word ""ROBOT"" has two R\'s? Let me check: R-O-B-O-T -> only one R? Actually no, it\'s R-O-B-O-T, so R at position 1, and no other R. But then we have B and O and T. However, we must avoid using A? But we can use O and B and T.\n\n But note: we know that A is not in the word, so O is a good vowel to test.\n\n However, ""ROBOT"" has two O\'s? Actually: positions 2 and 4? -> R-O-B-O-T: positions: 1-R, 2-O, 3-B, 4-O, 5-T. That has two O\'s. It might be inefficient.\n\n Let me see: which letters have we tried? Only C,R,A,N,E. So we can use many letters.\n\n After considering, I think making a guess that uses R in position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5 and tests new letters. \n\n Another common word is ""TRIES"": but note we are avoiding E? Because E was absent. So E cannot be used.\n\n So avoid any word that has C, A, N, E.\n\n Therefore, let me pick ""SPORT"". This word: S, P, O, R, T -> all new letters? Yes, except R.\n\n And we avoid E and A. We also don\'t use C,N.\n\n Also, R is at position 4? In ""SPORT"": \n   Position 1: S\n   Position 2: P\n   Position 3: O\n   Position 4: R\n   Position 5: T\n\n Now, if the secret word has R at position 4, we\'ll get a ✓ on R? Otherwise, if R is elsewhere we get a \'-\' or ... but wait: we know R is in the word, so we\'ll either get it in position 4 or we\'ll get a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 4.\n\n Also, we get to test S, P, O, and T.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L -> but then R at position 2? Wait, position 2: R -> we don\'t want R at position 2 because we know the secret word does not have R at position 2. So avoid.\n\n How about ""SHIRT"": \n   S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, R at 4, T at 5 -> R at position 4.\n\n This is similar to ""SPORT"".\n\n Or ""BIRTH"": B at 1, I at 2, R at 3, T at 4, H at 5 -> R at position 3.\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""BIRTH"" because it covers different letters: B, I, R, T, H.\n\n We\'ll see:\n   If R is at position 3: ✓\n   Otherwise: - (but not at position 3)\n\n But note: our previous guess had R at position 2 and got -, meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Now position 3: so we are testing a new position.\n\n Also, we are testing B at 1, I at 2, T at 4, H at 5.\n\n Since we don\'t have any information about the positions, this should be good.\n\n Alternatively, ""PORTY""? Not a common word.\n\n I think ""BIRTH"" is a valid word. \n\n However, after reconsideration, I think ""SPORT"" might be better because it doesn\'t use I which is a vowel? Actually, I is also a vowel. \n\n But let\'s choose ""SPORT"".\n\n Or what about ""STORM""?\n\n ""STORM"": S, T, O, R, M -> has R at position 4? \n Position 1: S\n Position 2: T\n Position 3: O\n Position 4: R\n Position 5: M\n\n Also, we test S, T, O, M and R. \n\n But note: ""STORM"" doesn\'t have the letter P, so ""SPORT"" has P and ""STORM"" doesn\'t. \n\n Actually, both are valid.\n\n Maybe ""STORM"" is a better choice because T and O are more common than P? Actually, I\'m not sure.\n\n Since we are testing position 2 with a new letter (in storm it\'s T, in sport it\'s P), I think either is good.\n\n I\'ll choose ""STORM"".\n\n So the second guess: ""STORM"".\n\n But wait, in the first guess we used ""crane"", and now ""storm"", so we are testing:\n\n   S: position 1\n   T: position 2\n   O: position 3\n   R: position 4\n   M: position 5\n\n We know R is in the word, so we\'ll get information on where R is and we also cover S,T,O,M.\n\n So let\'s go with ""storm"".\n\n Therefore, the guess is ""storm"".\n\n<guess>storm</guess>Based on the feedback for ""crane"", I know:\n- R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n- The word contains R and excludes C, A, N, E.\n\nFor my next guess, I need:\n- A 5-letter word containing R (avoiding position 2).\n- New letters from unused English alphabet (avoiding C,A,N,E).\n- High-information letters to narrow possibilities.\n\nSelected ""storm"" because:\n- Places R in position 4 (new position).\n- Tests new common letters: S, T, O, M.\n- Avoids C,A,N,E and conflicting positions.\n\n<guess>storm</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: storm -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) R(✓) M(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and feedback:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n  - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was misplaced at position 2).\n  - C, A, N, E are absent.\n\nGuess 2: storm -> S(✓), T(✓), O(✓), R(✓), M(x)\nMeaning:\n  - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1: because in ""storm"", S is first and got ✓).\n  - T is correct and in position (position 2: because T is second and got ✓).\n  - O is correct and in position (position 3: because O is third and got ✓).\n  - R is correct and in position (position 4: because R is fourth and got ✓).\n  - M is absent.\n\nSo from the feedback of ""storm"", we know:\n  The secret word has letters S, T, O, R in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively, and the fifth letter is not M.\n\nAlso, from guess 1, we know that the secret word contains R, which we now know is in position 4.

That letter must not be any of the absent letters: C,A,N,E,M.\n\nAlso, it must not be R? But wait, the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say anything against duplicates. However, in ""storm"" we had only one M which was absent, so if the word had two R\'s? But our feedback from ""storm"": we have R at position 4 is correct. And in ""crane"" we had R at position 2 which was misplaced. But if the word has two R\'s, it would have been indicated? Actually, the feedback only tells us about each instance.\n\nBut in ""storm"", if the word had another R somewhere else, it would have shown up as ✓ or - for that position? We don\'t know because we haven\'t tested.\n\nBut in this case, our word pattern is fixed as positions 1,2,3,4: S,T,O,R. Only position 5 is variable.\n\nThe fifth letter must be an English letter forming a valid word.\n\nList of possible words ending with STOR_:\n - stora: but not common, might be a proper noun? Probably not.\n - stork: valid, means a bird.\n - storm: not possible because M is absent.\n - story: valid, meaning a tale.\n - stour: valid, meaning a strong wind or stir, especially in UK English.\n - stowp: less common, variant of stoup? But Wordle usually uses common words.\n\nAlso, are there others? Like ""stopt""? Past tense? Not common. ""stogy""? Also written as ""stogie"", but that is 5 letters: stogy.\n\nSo common ones: stork, story, stour? \n\nBut we must verify:\n\nIn ""crane"" we had R present but in the wrong position. In our pattern, R is at position 4. Could there be another R? For example, in ""story"": there is only one R? Yes: S-T-O-R-Y -> R at position 4. So that matches.\n\nSimilarly, ""stork"": S-T-O-R-K -> one R.\n\nIn ""crane"", we had R at position 2 (which was wrong) and since the word actually has R only at position 4, that explains why it was marked \'-\' (present but not at that position).\n\nNow, which one to choose? We have three possibilities: stork, story, stour.\n\nWe also have not tried K, Y, U.\n\nWe can guess one and if wrong, we have more tries. But we have 6 tries total and we are on the third guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can make a guess that includes multiple options? But we don\'t have that because the pattern is fixed: STOR?\nActually, the fifth letter must be one letter.\n\nSince we have limited possibilities, we can guess one of them.\n\nLet\'s see: common words: both story and stork are common. Stour is less common.\n\nWe can also think of other feedback: none.\n\nBut we tested the letter M and it was absent. So if we choose ""stork"", we test K. Even if it\'s not the word, we get information? But actually, we are guessing the word.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s consider that we have ruled out several letters: C,A,N,E,M. We also know S,T,O,R are present and in position.\n\nWe need to select a word: either stork or story.\n\nBut story: has Y. Is Y a vowel? Common? It exists.\n\nstork: K is a consonant.\n\nWe can also consider ""straw""? But that doesn\'t fit: STRAW -> positions: 1:S, 2:T? No, S T R A W doesn\'t match because we need S at 1, T at 2, then O at 3? but straw has R at position 3? So it\'s STRAW -> S at 1, T at 2, R at 3? Not O at 3.\n\nTherefore, it must be STOR? so only the last letter varies.\n\nWe\'ll choose ""stork"" because it\'s common and tests K.\n\nAnother candidate: ""store"" is ruled out because of E.\n\nSo:\n\n  Possible: stork (K), story (Y), stour (U)\n\nMy decision: We\'ll guess ""stork"". \n\nWhy? Maybe ""story"" is more common? Both are valid. Let\'s choose ""story"", but note: if we guess ""story"", and it\'s wrong, we know that the last letter is not Y? Then we can guess stork or stour. Similarly, if we guess stork first and wrong, we rule out K.\n\nBut since it\'s third guess, I\'ll start with ""story""?\n\nWait: we have no other information. We should guess one. As a statistical likelihood, ""story"" might be more common? But Wordle words are curated, both are possible.\n\nIn the previous feedback, we had no other letters, so either choice is fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""story"" because it\'s a very common word.\n\nSo guess: ""story""\n\nBut first, let me check the feedback again: in the second guess with ""storm"", M was absent. So ""story"" does not include M? It doesn\'t, so okay.\n\nBut ""story"" doesn\'t have M? The letters of story: S,T,O,R,Y -> no M.\n\nTherefore, we can guess ""story"".\n\nBut note: the feedback from ""crane"": we had A absent? Yes, so no A in story? There is no A.\n\nAlso, E absent? So no E.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the guess: ""story""\n\nAlternatively, to confirm: STOR? Yes, and ? = Y.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""story"".\n\nBut wait: we have already used the letter O? And we know it is correct? So no problem.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""story"".\n\nHowever, note that the secret word might be ""stour"", but we\'ll get feedback.\n\nBut I\'ll choose ""story"".\n\nSo: <guess>story</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- From ""crane"": R is in the word (but not in position 2), and C, A, N, E are absent.\n- From ""storm"": S, T, O, R are correct and in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively, and M is absent.\n\nThe secret word is **S T O R ?** where the fifth letter:\n- Must form a valid English word.\n- Cannot be M, C, A, N, E (from previous feedback).\n- Possible candidates include common words like ""stork"", ""story"", or ""stour"".\n\nSince ""story"" is a frequent 5-letter English word ending in Y (a letter not yet ruled out), and it fits the known constraints (positions 1-4: S,T,O,R), it is a strong candidate. Guessing ""story"" will confirm if Y is the fifth letter or provide information about other possibilities like ""stork"" or ""stour"".\n\n<guess>story</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: storm -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) R(✓) M(x)\nGuess 3: story -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) R(✓) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback for the third guess ""story"":
  S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) R(✓) Y(x)

This means:
  S, T, O, R are in the correct positions (1,2,3,4) and Y is absent.

But note: the secret word is S T O R ? and the fifth letter is not Y.

Also, from previous feedback, we know that the fifth letter cannot be M, C, A, N, E (from guess1 and guess2).

So the fifth letter must be a letter that is not: C, A, N, E, M, Y.

We have two common words that fit: ""stork"" and ""stour"". 

But we have already tried ""story"" and Y is absent, so ""story"" is not the word.

Now, we must choose between ""stork"" and ""stour"". 

We have 6 tries and we are on the fourth guess.

We can guess one of them. 

Let's consider the letters: 
  - ""stork"" has K at the end.
  - ""stour"" has U at the end.

We haven't tested K or U in any previous guesses.

We can choose either. 

But note: we have limited information about the fifth letter. 

Alternatively, we can think: are there any other words? 

Other possibilities: 
  - ""stowp"" (if accepted, but it's less common)
  - ""stoln""? Not a word.
  - ""stopt""? Not common.

So the main candidates are ""stork"" and ""stour"".

I think ""stork"" is more common than ""stour"", so I'll guess ""stork"".

But let me check: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 which was misplaced. In ""stork"", the only R is at position 4, so that's consistent. Similarly for ""stour"".

Also, we know the fifth letter is not M, C, A, N, E, Y.

So we'll guess ""stork"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""stork"".

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (storm)**: S, T, O, R are correct and in positions 1, 2, 3, 4. M is absent.
- **Guess 3 (story)**: S, T, O, R remain correct in positions 1–4. Y is absent.

The secret word is **S T O R ?**, where the fifth letter:
- Must be a valid English letter.
- Cannot be C, A, N, E (from Guess 1), M (from Guess 2), or Y (from Guess 3).
- Must form a valid 5-letter word.

Possible candidates include:
- **stork** (ends with K)
- **stour** (ends with U)

""stork"" is selected as the next guess because it is a common word and tests the letter K, which hasn't been tried yet. If incorrect, ""stour"" will be the next logical guess.
