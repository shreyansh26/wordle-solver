We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word often contains common letters and has a balanced set of vowels and consonants.

 A commonly recommended starting word for Wordle is ""CRANE"". It has 3 consonants and 2 vowels, and the letters are fairly common.

 Alternatively, ""SALET"" or ""ROATE"" are also good. But we'll go with ""CRANE"" for its balance.

 Let's use: CRANE

We need to make the first guess for a 5-letter word game with no prior information. The goal is to maximize the information we get about the secret word. 

A strong first guess should:
- Cover common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to test vowel placements
- Include common consonants (like R, S, T, N) that appear frequently in English words
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities

Considering these factors, ""CRANE"" is an excellent starting word:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N)
- Covers 5 distinct letters
- Uses C, R, A, N, E – all top-tier frequency letters in English

We'll use ""CRANE"" as the initial guess to gather feedback on letter positions/presence efficiently.

We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is present in the secret word but not in position 1 (since we have '-' meaning wrong position)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is present but not in position 4 (wrong position)
- E is not in the word (x)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters C and N, but not in their guessed positions (position 1 and 4, respectively).
- The secret word does not contain R, A, or E.

Therefore, the secret word has C and N, and it does not have R, A, E.

We must make a new guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word.
- Contains C and N (since they are present).
- Does not contain R, A, E.
- Places C not in position 1 and N not in position 4.

Considering these constraints, we can brainstorm words that have C and N, and avoid R, A, E.

Let's think of common letters that are still possible. Since we know only C and N are present so far, we need to cover other vowels and consonants.

We know the word must have a C, but not in position 1. Also, it has an N, not in position 4.

Possible positions for C: 2, 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (since not position 4).

We also need to include other letters to test. We should avoid R, A, E.

Alternative vowels: O, U, I (and sometimes Y? but we'll avoid Y for now as it is less common).

Common consonants we haven't tested: S, T, L, D, etc.

One approach is to choose a word that uses the known letters (C and N) in new positions and introduces new letters to test.

We can consider words like:
- ""CLINT"" (but note T is new, and the positions: C in pos1? but we know C cannot be in pos1 because feedback for C was '-' meaning present but not in pos1. So ""CLINT"" has C in pos1, which we must avoid).
Alternatively, words with C in positions 2-5.

For example:
- Position 2: Having C as second letter: words like ""SCENT"", but note E is ruled out, so no.
- We avoid A, E, R.

Try words with C in position 3? For example, ""TOPIC"", but O and I are new, and note we already know E is absent. Wait, let's try to find words without E.

List of words without A, E, R and also without the letters we know are absent (R,A,E).

Possible: O, U, I, B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, etc.

But we need to include C and N.

Let me try to think of words that have C and N, and without A, E, R.

Examples:
- Music? -> has E? No, MUSIC: M,U,S,I,C -> but C is in position5, N is missing? Wait, we need N.

Must have both C and N.

Words:
- CLUNG: C,L,U,N,G -> positions: C in 1? but C cannot be in pos1. So if we use CLUNG, we must ensure C isn't in position 1? Wait, CLUNG has C in 1 -> invalid because we know C cannot be in 1.
- LUNCH: L,U,N,C,H -> C in position 4, N in position 3 -> avoids known A,E,R.
  - Check positions: 
    - N is in position 3? We don't know if position3 is allowed for N. Since in the first guess N was in position4 and that was wrong, but N could be in position3. Similarly, C is in position4, which we don't know yet if that position is forbidden for C? Only position1 is forbidden for C.
  - This seems good: LUNCH introduces L, U, H.
  - We are testing new letters: L, U, H.

Another option: ""PUNCH"" -> P,U,N,C,H -> similar to LUNCH, but starting with P.

Or ""BUNCH"" -> B,U,N,C,H.

But each of these might be good.

We want a word that doesn't repeat the positions of C and N incorrectly? Since we know C isn't in 1 and N isn't in 4, we must avoid those positions.

In LUNCH (L-U-N-C-H):
- Position1: L (new)
- Position2: U (new vowel)
- Position3: N (N is here; in the first guess, N was in position4 and not correct, but now we put N in position3 -> okay because position3 might be correct? We don't know, but we're testing)
- Position4: C (C was in position1 before, now we move it to position4 -> might be correct)
- Position5: H (new)

This is acceptable because we avoid C in position1 and N in position4.

Similarly, ""BUNCH"" is B,U,N,C,H.

Another word: ""CONCH"" -> but O is new, and letters: C,O,N,C,H -> oh, it has double C? That might be problematic because we don't know if the word has two C's. But our feedback only showed one C? Actually, the feedback showed that C is present, but it might be one or more. However, we don't know. We should avoid double letters for now to maximize information.

Similarly, ""LUNCH"" doesn't repeat letters, so it's good.

We can also consider ""SYNCH"", but S,Y are new.

But let me look for other words without A, E, R and with C and N.

Another one: ""DUNCE"" -> but E is absent, so we can't use that.

""FLINC"" is not a word.

""INCOG"" not common.

""MINCY"" -> M,I,N,C,Y -> without A,E,R -> letters: M,I,N,C,Y -> but Y is less common.

But let's choose something with common letters.

I think ""LUNCH"" is a good candidate because:
- It uses C and N in positions we haven't tried (C in position4, N in position3).
- It introduces three new letters: L, U, H.

We can then get feedback on L, U, H and whether C in 4 or N in 3 are correct.

Another possibility: ""HUNCH"" -> same as LUNCH but with H at start? H in pos1, but we don't know.

But ""LUNCH"" is more standard.

Alternatively, ""PUNCH"" or ""BUNCH"" are also common.

I'll go with ""LUNCH"".

But note: we have two constraints:
1. C must not be in position1 -> okay, in LUNCH, C is in position4.
2. N must not be in position4 -> okay, in LUNCH, N is in position3.

So it meets the constraints.

Therefore, guess: LUNCH

Let's write it in the required format.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (indicated by ""-"")
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (indicated by ""-"")
- R, A, and E are not in the word at all (indicated by ""x"")

Constraints for the next guess:
- Must include C and N (since they are present in the secret word).
- C cannot be in position 1.
- N cannot be in position 4.
- Must exclude R, A, and E (since they are absent).
- Should introduce new common vowels/consonants to test.

Considering these, ""LUNCH"" is a suitable guess:
- Contains C (in position 4) and N (in position 3), satisfying both presence requirements and avoiding forbidden positions.
- Includes L, U, and H as new letters to test, covering common vowels/consonants.
- Adheres to English word rules and avoids excluded letters (R, A, E).

<thinking>
The goal is to gather more information about the secret word. ""LUNCH"" efficiently positions the known letters (C and N) in new slots (avoiding positions 1 and 4) while testing unused vowels/consonants (L, U, H). Feedback will clarify:
- Accuracy of U (potential vowel) and L/H (common consonants).
- Whether N in position 3 or C in position 4 is correct.
- Any additional present letters.

 A good starting word often contains common letters and has a balanced set of vowels and consonants.

 A commonly recommended starting word for Wordle is ""CRANE"". It has 3 consonants and 2 vowels, and the letters are fairly common.

 Alternatively, ""SALET"" or ""ROATE"" are also good. But we'll go with ""CRANE"" for its balance.

 Let's use: CRANE

 So our first guess is ""CRANE"".<thinking>
We need to make the first guess for a 5-letter word game with no prior information. The goal is to maximize the information we get about the secret word. 

A strong first guess should:
- Cover common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to test vowel placements
- Include common consonants (like R, S, T, N) that appear frequently in English words
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities

Considering these factors, ""CRANE"" is an excellent starting word:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N)
- Covers 5 distinct letters
- Uses C, R, A, N, E – all top-tier frequency letters in English

We'll use ""CRANE"" as the initial guess to gather feedback on letter positions/presence efficiently.

We must make a new guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word.
- Contains C and N (since they are present).
- Does not contain R, A, E.
- Places C not in position 1 and N not in position 4.

Considering these constraints, we can brainstorm words that have C and N, and avoid R, A, E.

Let's think of common letters that are still possible. Since we know only C and N are present so far, we need to cover other vowels and consonants.

We know the word must have a C, but not in position 1. Also, it has an N, not in position 4.

Possible positions for C: 2, 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (since not position 4).

We also need to include other letters to test. We should avoid R, A, E.

Alternative vowels: O, U, I (and sometimes Y? but we'll avoid Y for now as it is less common).

Common consonants we haven't tested: S, T, L, D, etc.

One approach is to choose a word that uses the known letters (C and N) in new positions and introduces new letters to test.

We can consider words like:
- ""CLINT"" (but note T is new, and the positions: C in pos1? but we know C cannot be in pos1 because feedback for C was '-' meaning present but not in pos1. So ""CLINT"" has C in pos1, which we must avoid).
Alternatively, words with C in positions 2-5.

For example:
- Position 2: Having C as second letter: words like ""SCENT"", but note E is ruled out, so no.
- We avoid A, E, R.

Try words with C in position 3? For example, ""TOPIC"", but O and I are new, and note we already know E is absent. Wait, let's try to find words without E.

List of words without A, E, R and also without the letters we know are absent (R,A,E).

Possible: O, U, I, B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, etc.

But we need to include C and N.

Let me try to think of words that have C and N, and without A, E, R.

Examples:
- Music? -> has E? No, MUSIC: M,U,S,I,C -> but C is in position5, N is missing? Wait, we need N.

Must have both C and N.

Words:
- CLUNG: C,L,U,N,G -> positions: C in 1? but C cannot be in pos1. So if we use CLUNG, we must ensure C isn't in position 1? Wait, CLUNG has C in 1 -> invalid because we know C cannot be in 1.
- LUNCH: L,U,N,C,H -> C in position 4, N in position 3 -> avoids known A,E,R.
  - Check positions: 
    - N is in position 3? We don't know if position3 is allowed for N. Since in the first guess N was in position4 and that was wrong, but N could be in position3. Similarly, C is in position4, which we don't know yet if that position is forbidden for C? Only position1 is forbidden for C.
  - This seems good: LUNCH introduces L, U, H.
  - We are testing new letters: L, U, H.

Another option: ""PUNCH"" -> P,U,N,C,H -> similar to LUNCH, but starting with P.

Or ""BUNCH"" -> B,U,N,C,H.

But each of these might be good.

We want a word that doesn't repeat the positions of C and N incorrectly? Since we know C isn't in 1 and N isn't in 4, we must avoid those positions.

In LUNCH (L-U-N-C-H):
- Position1: L (new)
- Position2: U (new vowel)
- Position3: N (N is here; in the first guess, N was in position4 and not correct, but now we put N in position3 -> okay because position3 might be correct? We don't know, but we're testing)
- Position4: C (C was in position1 before, now we move it to position4 -> might be correct)
- Position5: H (new)

This is acceptable because we avoid C in position1 and N in position4.

Similarly, ""BUNCH"" is B,U,N,C,H.

Another word: ""CONCH"" -> but O is new, and letters: C,O,N,C,H -> oh, it has double C? That might be problematic because we don't know if the word has two C's. But our feedback only showed one C? Actually, the feedback showed that C is present, but it might be one or more. However, we don't know. We should avoid double letters for now to maximize information.

Similarly, ""LUNCH"" doesn't repeat letters, so it's good.

We can also consider ""SYNCH"", but S,Y are new.

But let me look for other words without A, E, R and with C and N.

Another one: ""DUNCE"" -> but E is absent, so we can't use that.

""FLINC"" is not a word.

""INCOG"" not common.

""MINCY"" -> M,I,N,C,Y -> without A,E,R -> letters: M,I,N,C,Y -> but Y is less common.

But let's choose something with common letters.

I think ""LUNCH"" is a good candidate because:
- It uses C and N in positions we haven't tried (C in position4, N in position3).
- It introduces three new letters: L, U, H.

We can then get feedback on L, U, H and whether C in 4 or N in 3 are correct.

Another possibility: ""HUNCH"" -> same as LUNCH but with H at start? H in pos1, but we don't know.

But ""LUNCH"" is more standard.

Alternatively, ""PUNCH"" or ""BUNCH"" are also common.

I'll go with ""LUNCH"".

But note: we have two constraints:
1. C must not be in position1 -> okay, in LUNCH, C is in position4.
2. N must not be in position4 -> okay, in LUNCH, N is in position3.

So it meets the constraints.

Therefore, guess: LUNCH

Let's write it in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (indicated by ""-"")
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (indicated by ""-"")
- R, A, and E are not in the word at all (indicated by ""x"")

Constraints for the next guess:
- Must include C and N (since they are present in the secret word).
- C cannot be in position 1.
- N cannot be in position 4.
- Must exclude R, A, and E (since they are absent).
- Should introduce new common vowels/consonants to test.

Considering these, ""LUNCH"" is a suitable guess:
- Contains C (in position 4) and N (in position 3), satisfying both presence requirements and avoiding forbidden positions.
- Includes L, U, and H as new letters to test, covering common vowels/consonants.
- Adheres to English word rules and avoids excluded letters (R, A, E).

<thinking>
The goal is to gather more information about the secret word. ""LUNCH"" efficiently positions the known letters (C and N) in new slots (avoiding positions 1 and 4) while testing unused vowels/consonants (L, U, H). Feedback will clarify:
- Accuracy of U (potential vowel) and L/H (common consonants).
- Whether N in position 3 or C in position 4 is correct.
- Any additional present letters.

We are given feedback from the second guess: LUNCH -> L(x) U(x) N(✓) C(-) H(x)

Interpretation:
- L is not in the word (x)
- U is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3) (✓)
- C is in the word but not in position 4 (since we have '-' meaning wrong position)
- H is not in the word (x)

So, from all feedback so far:

From Guess 1 (CRANE):
- C is present, but not in position 1.
- R, A, E are absent.
- N is present, but not in position 4.

From Guess 2 (LUNCH):
- N is in the correct position (position 3).
- C is present, but not in position 4.
- L, U, H are absent.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter N in position 3.
- The secret word has the letter C, but not in position 1 or 4 (from Guess1 and Guess2).
- Absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H.

We must make a new guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word.
- Has N in position 3.
- Contains the letter C, but not in position 1, 4, or 3 (because position 3 is taken by N, so C can't be there). Also, from Guess1, C is not in position1, and from Guess2, C is not in position4. So C must be in position 2 or 5.
- Does not contain R, A, E, L, U, H.

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters to test.

Possible positions for C: only 2 or 5.

Let's consider the word structure: _ _ N _ _

We need to put C in position 2 or 5.

We also need to choose letters for positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 (but if C is in 2, then position 2 is C, and we need 1,4,5; if C is in 5, then we need 1,2,4).

We should avoid the absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H.

Available letters: we haven't tested many consonants and vowels. We should test common vowels: O, I, and sometimes Y. Consonants: S, T, D, M, P, B, G, K, etc.

We can consider two cases: C in position 2 or C in position 5.

First, let's try with C in position 2: so the word is _ C N _ _

We need to choose position 1, 4, and 5 without R,A,E,L,U,H.

Possible words:
- ICONS: I in pos1, C in pos2, N in pos3, S in pos4, but we need a 5th letter? Wait, ICONS is 5 letters: I-C-O-N-S -> but N is in pos4? We need N in pos3. So not.

We need N in pos3, so for a word like _ C N _ _

Examples:
- SCION: S-C-I-O-N -> but S in pos1, C in pos2, I in pos3? No, we need N in pos3. SCION has I in pos3 and N in pos5 -> not matching.

We need the third letter to be N.

Another: BACON? But A is absent, and B is possible? But A is absent, so no.

Let me think of words with the pattern _ C N _ _

Without A, E, R, L, U, H.

Possible:
- ACORN: but A is absent -> invalid.
- ICING: I-C-I-N-G -> but position3 is I, not N -> no.
- We need position3 to be N.

What about ""SCENT""? But E is absent -> invalid.

""OCEAN"" -> E and A absent.

It's tricky.

Perhaps ""CYTON""? Not common.

Another idea: ""MUCIN""? But U is absent.

Maybe we should consider C in position 5.

So the word is _ _ N _ C

Now, we need to fill positions 1,2,4 without R,A,E,L,U,H.

And position5 is C.

Examples:
- POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> but position3 is I, not N -> no.
- We need position3 to be N, so _ _ N _ C

Like: 
- BONEC? Not a word.
- CONIC? But C in position1? We know C cannot be in position1. Also, CONIC has C in position1 and position5? But position1 is forbidden for C.

We must avoid C in position1.

So for pattern _ _ N _ C, position1 cannot be C.

Words:
- POINC? Not a word.
- JOINC? No.
- MINCE? But E is absent -> invalid.
- DANCE? A and E absent -> invalid.
- PINCH? But H is absent -> invalid.

This is difficult. Maybe we need to consider that C might be in position2.

Let me search for words with N in position3 and C in position2.

Pattern: ? C N ? ?

Without A,E,R,L,U,H.

Possible words:
- SCENE? E is absent -> no.
- SCONE? O is new, but E is absent -> no.
- SCANT? A is absent -> no.
- SCINT? Not a word.
- Maybe ""CYANI""? Not common.

Another: ""OCTAN""? But A is absent.

Perhaps we are missing some words. Let's think of common words.

""ACING"" -> A absent.

""ICING"" -> position3 is I, not N.

Wait, what about ""CON"" words? But C cannot be in position1.

Perhaps ""MCN"" something? Like ""MCNUG""? Not a word.

Maybe we should consider that the word might have the letter C in position5 and use a word that tests that.

Let me list possible words that have N in position3 and contain C, without the absent letters.

We can use a word that has C in position5 and N in position3.

For example, ""TONIC"": T-O-N-I-C -> 
- Position1: T
- Position2: O
- Position3: N (correct, as required)
- Position4: I
- Position5: C

Now, check absent letters: T, O, I are not in the absent list (R,A,E,L,U,H are absent, but T,O,I are new and allowed).

So ""TONIC"" seems valid.

Also, C is in position5, which is allowed (since we only know C is not in 1,3,4; position3 is taken by N, so C can be in 2 or 5, and 5 is fine).

Similarly, we avoid the absent letters.

Another possibility: ""CONIC"" but C in position1 is forbidden.

""IONIC"": I-O-N-I-C -> position1: I, position2: O, position3: N, position4: I, position5: C. This also works, but has double I? But that's okay if the word allows.

But ""TONIC"" is more common.

""MANIC"": but A is absent -> invalid.

""PANIC"": A absent.

""SONIC"": S-O-N-I-C -> S is new, O, I, C. Absent letters don't include S,O,I.

So ""SONIC"" is also possible.

But we have two options: TONIC and SONIC.

We can choose one that tests more common letters.

We also need to consider that we haven't tested S or T yet.

Both are good.

But note: in TONIC, we test T, O, I, and C (C we know is present, but position5 is new).

Similarly, SONIC tests S, O, I, C.

We might also consider ""BONUS"" but U is absent and S is in position5, but we need C in the word? We must include C because it is present.

The guess must include C, since we know C is in the word.

So we cannot use ""BONUS"" because it doesn't have C.

Similarly, we must have C in the guess.

So TONIC and SONIC are both valid.

Let's choose TONIC to test T and O.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

Another word: ""CONKY""? Not common and C in position1 forbidden.

""PUNCH"" we already did, but U and H absent.

I think TONIC is a good choice.

But let's confirm the feedback constraints.

In TONIC:
- Position1: T (new)
- Position2: O (new)
- Position3: N (correct, we know)
- Position4: I (new)
- Position5: C (we know C is present, and we are testing position5)

We avoid R,A,E,L,U,H.

So it should be fine.

We can also consider ""YONIC"", but Y is less common.

I think TONIC is better.

So we'll go with TONIC.

But note: we have to make sure that C is not in position4? In TONIC, C is in position5, which is not forbidden. We only know C is not in 1,3,4. Position3 is N, so C can be in 2 or 5. Position5 is allowed.

Similarly, for position2, we are not putting C there in this guess.

But we are testing position5 for C.

If we get feedback that C is in the correct position, then we know it's position5. If not, then C must be in position2.

But in this guess, we are putting C in position5.

So let's do that.

Guess: TONIC

But wait, is there a word that tests position2 for C? We could, but we are also testing other letters.

Alternatively, we could use a word with C in position2, but we had trouble finding one.

Another word: ""SCONE"" but E is absent.

""SCUBA"" but U and A absent.

I think TONIC is acceptable.

So we'll go with TONIC.

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is present but not in position 1.  
  - R, A, E are absent.  
  - N is present but not in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: LUNCH** → Feedback: L(x) U(x) N(✓) C(-) H(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - L, U, H are absent.  
  - N is correct and in position 3.  
  - C is present but not in position 4.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - **N** is in the word and fixed in **position 3**.  
   - **C** is present but cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from feedback). Thus, C must be in position 2 or 5.  
2. **Absent Letters**: R, A, E, L, U, H (cannot appear in the word).  
3. **Word Structure**: The secret word has the pattern `_ _ N _ _`, with C in position 2 or 5.  
4. **Goal for Next Guess**:  
   - Test C in position 5 (since position 2 is also possible, but position 5 allows testing new letters).  
   - Introduce new common letters (e.g., O, I, T, S) to gather more information.  
   - Avoid absent letters and forbidden positions for C.

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- **TONIC** is chosen because:  
  - Fits the pattern `T O N I C`:  
    - Position 3 is N (correct, as required).  
    - C is placed in position 5 (tests the possibility that C is in position 5; if wrong, C must be in position 2).  
  - Uses new, common letters:  
    - T (common consonant, untested).  
    - O and I (common vowels, untested).  
  - Avoids all absent letters (R, A, E, L, U, H).  
- If feedback shows C(✓) in position 5, we confirm C's position. If C(-), we know C must be in position 2. Feedback on T, O, and I will also reveal their presence/absence.

<guess>TONIC</guess>",TONIC,"We are given feedback from the second guess: LUNCH -> L(x) U(x) N(✓) C(-) H(x)

Interpretation:
- L is not in the word (x)
- U is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3) (✓)
- C is in the word but not in position 4 (since we have '-' meaning wrong position)
- H is not in the word (x)

So, from all feedback so far:

From Guess 1 (CRANE):
- C is present, but not in position 1.
- R, A, E are absent.
- N is present, but not in position 4.

From Guess 2 (LUNCH):
- N is in the correct position (position 3).
- C is present, but not in position 4.
- L, U, H are absent.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter N in position 3.
- The secret word has the letter C, but not in position 1 or 4 (from Guess1 and Guess2).
- Absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H.

We must make a new guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word.
- Has N in position 3.
- Contains the letter C, but not in position 1, 4, or 3 (because position 3 is taken by N, so C can't be there). Also, from Guess1, C is not in position1, and from Guess2, C is not in position4. So C must be in position 2 or 5.
- Does not contain R, A, E, L, U, H.

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters to test.

Possible positions for C: only 2 or 5.

Let's consider the word structure: _ _ N _ _

We need to put C in position 2 or 5.

We also need to choose letters for positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 (but if C is in 2, then position 2 is C, and we need 1,4,5; if C is in 5, then we need 1,2,4).

We should avoid the absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H.

Available letters: we haven't tested many consonants and vowels. We should test common vowels: O, I, and sometimes Y. Consonants: S, T, D, M, P, B, G, K, etc.

We can consider two cases: C in position 2 or C in position 5.

First, let's try with C in position 2: so the word is _ C N _ _

We need to choose position 1, 4, and 5 without R,A,E,L,U,H.

Possible words:
- ICONS: I in pos1, C in pos2, N in pos3, S in pos4, but we need a 5th letter? Wait, ICONS is 5 letters: I-C-O-N-S -> but N is in pos4? We need N in pos3. So not.

We need N in pos3, so for a word like _ C N _ _

Examples:
- SCION: S-C-I-O-N -> but S in pos1, C in pos2, I in pos3? No, we need N in pos3. SCION has I in pos3 and N in pos5 -> not matching.

We need the third letter to be N.

Another: BACON? But A is absent, and B is possible? But A is absent, so no.

Let me think of words with the pattern _ C N _ _

Without A, E, R, L, U, H.

Possible:
- ACORN: but A is absent -> invalid.
- ICING: I-C-I-N-G -> but position3 is I, not N -> no.
- We need position3 to be N.

What about ""SCENT""? But E is absent -> invalid.

""OCEAN"" -> E and A absent.

It's tricky.

Perhaps ""CYTON""? Not common.

Another idea: ""MUCIN""? But U is absent.

Maybe we should consider C in position 5.

So the word is _ _ N _ C

Now, we need to fill positions 1,2,4 without R,A,E,L,U,H.

And position5 is C.

Examples:
- POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> but position3 is I, not N -> no.
- We need position3 to be N, so _ _ N _ C

Like: 
- BONEC? Not a word.
- CONIC? But C in position1? We know C cannot be in position1. Also, CONIC has C in position1 and position5? But position1 is forbidden for C.

We must avoid C in position1.

So for pattern _ _ N _ C, position1 cannot be C.

Words:
- POINC? Not a word.
- JOINC? No.
- MINCE? But E is absent -> invalid.
- DANCE? A and E absent -> invalid.
- PINCH? But H is absent -> invalid.

This is difficult. Maybe we need to consider that C might be in position2.

Let me search for words with N in position3 and C in position2.

Pattern: ? C N ? ?

Without A,E,R,L,U,H.

Possible words:
- SCENE? E is absent -> no.
- SCONE? O is new, but E is absent -> no.
- SCANT? A is absent -> no.
- SCINT? Not a word.
- Maybe ""CYANI""? Not common.

Another: ""OCTAN""? But A is absent.

Perhaps we are missing some words. Let's think of common words.

""ACING"" -> A absent.

""ICING"" -> position3 is I, not N.

Wait, what about ""CON"" words? But C cannot be in position1.

Perhaps ""MCN"" something? Like ""MCNUG""? Not a word.

Maybe we should consider that the word might have the letter C in position5 and use a word that tests that.

Let me list possible words that have N in position3 and contain C, without the absent letters.

We can use a word that has C in position5 and N in position3.

For example, ""TONIC"": T-O-N-I-C -> 
- Position1: T
- Position2: O
- Position3: N (correct, as required)
- Position4: I
- Position5: C

Now, check absent letters: T, O, I are not in the absent list (R,A,E,L,U,H are absent, but T,O,I are new and allowed).

So ""TONIC"" seems valid.

Also, C is in position5, which is allowed (since we only know C is not in 1,3,4; position3 is taken by N, so C can be in 2 or 5, and 5 is fine).

Similarly, we avoid the absent letters.

Another possibility: ""CONIC"" but C in position1 is forbidden.

""IONIC"": I-O-N-I-C -> position1: I, position2: O, position3: N, position4: I, position5: C. This also works, but has double I? But that's okay if the word allows.

But ""TONIC"" is more common.

""MANIC"": but A is absent -> invalid.

""PANIC"": A absent.

""SONIC"": S-O-N-I-C -> S is new, O, I, C. Absent letters don't include S,O,I.

So ""SONIC"" is also possible.

But we have two options: TONIC and SONIC.

We can choose one that tests more common letters.

We also need to consider that we haven't tested S or T yet.

Both are good.

But note: in TONIC, we test T, O, I, and C (C we know is present, but position5 is new).

Similarly, SONIC tests S, O, I, C.

We might also consider ""BONUS"" but U is absent and S is in position5, but we need C in the word? We must include C because it is present.

The guess must include C, since we know C is in the word.

So we cannot use ""BONUS"" because it doesn't have C.

Similarly, we must have C in the guess.

So TONIC and SONIC are both valid.

Let's choose TONIC to test T and O.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

Another word: ""CONKY""? Not common and C in position1 forbidden.

""PUNCH"" we already did, but U and H absent.

I think TONIC is a good choice.

But let's confirm the feedback constraints.

In TONIC:
- Position1: T (new)
- Position2: O (new)
- Position3: N (correct, we know)
- Position4: I (new)
- Position5: C (we know C is present, and we are testing position5)

We avoid R,A,E,L,U,H.

So it should be fine.

We can also consider ""YONIC"", but Y is less common.

I think TONIC is better.

So we'll go with TONIC.

But note: we have to make sure that C is not in position4? In TONIC, C is in position5, which is not forbidden. We only know C is not in 1,3,4. Position3 is N, so C can be in 2 or 5. Position5 is allowed.

Similarly, for position2, we are not putting C there in this guess.

But we are testing position5 for C.

If we get feedback that C is in the correct position, then we know it's position5. If not, then C must be in position2.

But in this guess, we are putting C in position5.

So let's do that.

Guess: TONIC

But wait, is there a word that tests position2 for C? We could, but we are also testing other letters.

Alternatively, we could use a word with C in position2, but we had trouble finding one.

Another word: ""SCONE"" but E is absent.

""SCUBA"" but U and A absent.

I think TONIC is acceptable.

So we'll go with TONIC.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is present but not in position 1.  
  - R, A, E are absent.  
  - N is present but not in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: LUNCH** → Feedback: L(x) U(x) N(✓) C(-) H(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - L, U, H are absent.  
  - N is correct and in position 3.  
  - C is present but not in position 4.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - **N** is in the word and fixed in **position 3**.  
   - **C** is present but cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from feedback). Thus, C must be in position 2 or 5.  
2. **Absent Letters**: R, A, E, L, U, H (cannot appear in the word).  
3. **Word Structure**: The secret word has the pattern `_ _ N _ _`, with C in position 2 or 5.  
4. **Goal for Next Guess**:  
   - Test C in position 5 (since position 2 is also possible, but position 5 allows testing new letters).  
   - Introduce new common letters (e.g., O, I, T, S) to gather more information.  
   - Avoid absent letters and forbidden positions for C.

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- **TONIC** is chosen because:  
  - Fits the pattern `T O N I C`:  
    - Position 3 is N (correct, as required).  
    - C is placed in position 5 (tests the possibility that C is in position 5; if wrong, C must be in position 2).  
  - Uses new, common letters:  
    - T (common consonant, untested).  
    - O and I (common vowels, untested).  
  - Avoids all absent letters (R, A, E, L, U, H).  
- If feedback shows C(✓) in position 5, we confirm C's position. If C(-), we know C must be in position 2. Feedback on T, O, and I will also reveal their presence/absence.",Guess 3: TONIC -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word often contains common letters and has a balanced set of vowels and consonants.

 A commonly recommended starting word for Wordle is ""CRANE"". It has 3 consonants and 2 vowels, and the letters are fairly common.

 Alternatively, ""SALET"" or ""ROATE"" are also good. But we'll go with ""CRANE"" for its balance.

 Let's use: CRANE

 So our first guess is ""CRANE"".<thinking>
We need to make the first guess for a 5-letter word game with no prior information. The goal is to maximize the information we get about the secret word. 

A strong first guess should:
- Cover common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to test vowel placements
- Include common consonants (like R, S, T, N) that appear frequently in English words
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities

Considering these factors, ""CRANE"" is an excellent starting word:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N)
- Covers 5 distinct letters
- Uses C, R, A, N, E – all top-tier frequency letters in English

We'll use ""CRANE"" as the initial guess to gather feedback on letter positions/presence efficiently.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is present in the secret word but not in position 1 (since we have '-' meaning wrong position)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is present but not in position 4 (wrong position)
- E is not in the word (x)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters C and N, but not in their guessed positions (position 1 and 4, respectively).
- The secret word does not contain R, A, or E.

Therefore, the secret word has C and N, and it does not have R, A, E.

We must make a new guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word.
- Contains C and N (since they are present).
- Does not contain R, A, E.
- Places C not in position 1 and N not in position 4.

Considering these constraints, we can brainstorm words that have C and N, and avoid R, A, E.

Let's think of common letters that are still possible. Since we know only C and N are present so far, we need to cover other vowels and consonants.

We know the word must have a C, but not in position 1. Also, it has an N, not in position 4.

Possible positions for C: 2, 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (since not position 4).

We also need to include other letters to test. We should avoid R, A, E.

Alternative vowels: O, U, I (and sometimes Y? but we'll avoid Y for now as it is less common).

Common consonants we haven't tested: S, T, L, D, etc.

One approach is to choose a word that uses the known letters (C and N) in new positions and introduces new letters to test.

We can consider words like:
- ""CLINT"" (but note T is new, and the positions: C in pos1? but we know C cannot be in pos1 because feedback for C was '-' meaning present but not in pos1. So ""CLINT"" has C in pos1, which we must avoid).
Alternatively, words with C in positions 2-5.

For example:
- Position 2: Having C as second letter: words like ""SCENT"", but note E is ruled out, so no.
- We avoid A, E, R.

Try words with C in position 3? For example, ""TOPIC"", but O and I are new, and note we already know E is absent. Wait, let's try to find words without E.

List of words without A, E, R and also without the letters we know are absent (R,A,E).

Possible: O, U, I, B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, etc.

But we need to include C and N.

Let me try to think of words that have C and N, and without A, E, R.

Examples:
- Music? -> has E? No, MUSIC: M,U,S,I,C -> but C is in position5, N is missing? Wait, we need N.

Must have both C and N.

Words:
- CLUNG: C,L,U,N,G -> positions: C in 1? but C cannot be in pos1. So if we use CLUNG, we must ensure C isn't in position 1? Wait, CLUNG has C in 1 -> invalid because we know C cannot be in 1.
- LUNCH: L,U,N,C,H -> C in position 4, N in position 3 -> avoids known A,E,R.
  - Check positions: 
    - N is in position 3? We don't know if position3 is allowed for N. Since in the first guess N was in position4 and that was wrong, but N could be in position3. Similarly, C is in position4, which we don't know yet if that position is forbidden for C? Only position1 is forbidden for C.
  - This seems good: LUNCH introduces L, U, H.
  - We are testing new letters: L, U, H.

Another option: ""PUNCH"" -> P,U,N,C,H -> similar to LUNCH, but starting with P.

Or ""BUNCH"" -> B,U,N,C,H.

But each of these might be good.

We want a word that doesn't repeat the positions of C and N incorrectly? Since we know C isn't in 1 and N isn't in 4, we must avoid those positions.

In LUNCH (L-U-N-C-H):
- Position1: L (new)
- Position2: U (new vowel)
- Position3: N (N is here; in the first guess, N was in position4 and not correct, but now we put N in position3 -> okay because position3 might be correct? We don't know, but we're testing)
- Position4: C (C was in position1 before, now we move it to position4 -> might be correct)
- Position5: H (new)

This is acceptable because we avoid C in position1 and N in position4.

Similarly, ""BUNCH"" is B,U,N,C,H.

Another word: ""CONCH"" -> but O is new, and letters: C,O,N,C,H -> oh, it has double C? That might be problematic because we don't know if the word has two C's. But our feedback only showed one C? Actually, the feedback showed that C is present, but it might be one or more. However, we don't know. We should avoid double letters for now to maximize information.

Similarly, ""LUNCH"" doesn't repeat letters, so it's good.

We can also consider ""SYNCH"", but S,Y are new.

But let me look for other words without A, E, R and with C and N.

Another one: ""DUNCE"" -> but E is absent, so we can't use that.

""FLINC"" is not a word.

""INCOG"" not common.

""MINCY"" -> M,I,N,C,Y -> without A,E,R -> letters: M,I,N,C,Y -> but Y is less common.

But let's choose something with common letters.

I think ""LUNCH"" is a good candidate because:
- It uses C and N in positions we haven't tried (C in position4, N in position3).
- It introduces three new letters: L, U, H.

We can then get feedback on L, U, H and whether C in 4 or N in 3 are correct.

Another possibility: ""HUNCH"" -> same as LUNCH but with H at start? H in pos1, but we don't know.

But ""LUNCH"" is more standard.

Alternatively, ""PUNCH"" or ""BUNCH"" are also common.

I'll go with ""LUNCH"".

But note: we have two constraints:
1. C must not be in position1 -> okay, in LUNCH, C is in position4.
2. N must not be in position4 -> okay, in LUNCH, N is in position3.

So it meets the constraints.

Therefore, guess: LUNCH

Let's write it in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (indicated by ""-"")
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (indicated by ""-"")
- R, A, and E are not in the word at all (indicated by ""x"")

Constraints for the next guess:
- Must include C and N (since they are present in the secret word).
- C cannot be in position 1.
- N cannot be in position 4.
- Must exclude R, A, and E (since they are absent).
- Should introduce new common vowels/consonants to test.

Considering these, ""LUNCH"" is a suitable guess:
- Contains C (in position 4) and N (in position 3), satisfying both presence requirements and avoiding forbidden positions.
- Includes L, U, and H as new letters to test, covering common vowels/consonants.
- Adheres to English word rules and avoids excluded letters (R, A, E).

<thinking>
The goal is to gather more information about the secret word. ""LUNCH"" efficiently positions the known letters (C and N) in new slots (avoiding positions 1 and 4) while testing unused vowels/consonants (L, U, H). Feedback will clarify:
- Accuracy of U (potential vowel) and L/H (common consonants).
- Whether N in position 3 or C in position 4 is correct.
- Any additional present letters.
</thinking>

- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3) (✓)
- C is in the word but not in position 4 (since we have '-' meaning wrong position)
- H is not in the word (x)

So, from all feedback so far:

From Guess 1 (CRANE):
- C is present, but not in position 1.
- R, A, E are absent.
- N is present, but not in position 4.

From Guess 2 (LUNCH):
- N is in the correct position (position 3).
- C is present, but not in position 4.
- L, U, H are absent.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter N in position 3.
- The secret word has the letter C, but not in position 1 or 4 (from Guess1 and Guess2).
- Absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H.

We must make a new guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word.
- Has N in position 3.
- Contains the letter C, but not in position 1, 4, or 3 (because position 3 is taken by N, so C can't be there). Also, from Guess1, C is not in position1, and from Guess2, C is not in position4. So C must be in position 2 or 5.
- Does not contain R, A, E, L, U, H.

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters to test.

Possible positions for C: only 2 or 5.

Let's consider the word structure: _ _ N _ _

We need to put C in position 2 or 5.

We also need to choose letters for positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 (but if C is in 2, then position 2 is C, and we need 1,4,5; if C is in 5, then we need 1,2,4).

We should avoid the absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H.

Available letters: we haven't tested many consonants and vowels. We should test common vowels: O, I, and sometimes Y. Consonants: S, T, D, M, P, B, G, K, etc.

We can consider two cases: C in position 2 or C in position 5.

First, let's try with C in position 2: so the word is _ C N _ _

We need to choose position 1, 4, and 5 without R,A,E,L,U,H.

Possible words:
- ICONS: I in pos1, C in pos2, N in pos3, S in pos4, but we need a 5th letter? Wait, ICONS is 5 letters: I-C-O-N-S -> but N is in pos4? We need N in pos3. So not.

We need N in pos3, so for a word like _ C N _ _

Examples:
- SCION: S-C-I-O-N -> but S in pos1, C in pos2, I in pos3? No, we need N in pos3. SCION has I in pos3 and N in pos5 -> not matching.

We need the third letter to be N.

Another: BACON? But A is absent, and B is possible? But A is absent, so no.

Let me think of words with the pattern _ C N _ _

Without A, E, R, L, U, H.

Possible:
- ACORN: but A is absent -> invalid.
- ICING: I-C-I-N-G -> but position3 is I, not N -> no.
- We need position3 to be N.

What about ""SCENT""? But E is absent -> invalid.

""OCEAN"" -> E and A absent.

It's tricky.

Perhaps ""CYTON""? Not common.

Another idea: ""MUCIN""? But U is absent.

Maybe we should consider C in position 5.

So the word is _ _ N _ C

Now, we need to fill positions 1,2,4 without R,A,E,L,U,H.

And position5 is C.

Examples:
- POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> but position3 is I, not N -> no.
- We need position3 to be N, so _ _ N _ C

Like: 
- BONEC? Not a word.
- CONIC? But C in position1? We know C cannot be in position1. Also, CONIC has C in position1 and position5? But position1 is forbidden for C.

We must avoid C in position1.

So for pattern _ _ N _ C, position1 cannot be C.

Words:
- POINC? Not a word.
- JOINC? No.
- MINCE? But E is absent -> invalid.
- DANCE? A and E absent -> invalid.
- PINCH? But H is absent -> invalid.

This is difficult. Maybe we need to consider that C might be in position2.

Let me search for words with N in position3 and C in position2.

Pattern: ? C N ? ?

Without A,E,R,L,U,H.

Possible words:

- SCONE? O is new, but E is absent -> no.
- SCANT? A is absent -> no.
- SCINT? Not a word.
- Maybe ""CYANI""? Not common.

Another: ""OCTAN""? But A is absent.

Perhaps we are missing some words. Let's think of common words.

""ACING"" -> A absent.

""ICING"" -> position3 is I, not N.

Wait, what about ""CON"" words? But C cannot be in position1.

Perhaps ""MCN"" something? Like ""MCNUG""? Not a word.

Maybe we should consider that the word might have the letter C in position5 and use a word that tests that.

Let me list possible words that have N in position3 and contain C, without the absent letters.

We can use a word that has C in position5 and N in position3.

For example, ""TONIC"": T-O-N-I-C -> 
- Position1: T
- Position2: O
- Position3: N (correct, as required)
- Position4: I
- Position5: C

Now, check absent letters: T, O, I are not in the absent list (R,A,E,L,U,H are absent, but T,O,I are new and allowed).

So ""TONIC"" seems valid.

Also, C is in position5, which is allowed (since we only know C is not in 1,3,4; position3 is taken by N, so C can be in 2 or 5, and 5 is fine).

Similarly, we avoid the absent letters.

Another possibility: ""CONIC"" but C in position1 is forbidden.

""IONIC"": I-O-N-I-C -> position1: I, position2: O, position3: N, position4: I, position5: C. This also works, but has double I? But that's okay if the word allows.

But ""TONIC"" is more common.

""MANIC"": but A is absent -> invalid.

""PANIC"": A absent.

""SONIC"": S-O-N-I-C -> S is new, O, I, C. Absent letters don't include S,O,I.

So ""SONIC"" is also possible.

But we have two options: TONIC and SONIC.

We can choose one that tests more common letters.

We also need to consider that we haven't tested S or T yet.

Both are good.

But note: in TONIC, we test T, O, I, and C (C we know is present, but position5 is new).

Similarly, SONIC tests S, O, I, C.

We might also consider ""BONUS"" but U is absent and S is in position5, but we need C in the word? We must include C because it is present.

The guess must include C, since we know C is in the word.

So we cannot use ""BONUS"" because it doesn't have C.

Similarly, we must have C in the guess.

So TONIC and SONIC are both valid.

Let's choose TONIC to test T and O.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

Another word: ""CONKY""? Not common and C in position1 forbidden.

""PUNCH"" we already did, but U and H absent.

I think TONIC is a good choice.

But let's confirm the feedback constraints.

In TONIC:
- Position1: T (new)
- Position2: O (new)
- Position3: N (correct, we know)
- Position4: I (new)
- Position5: C (we know C is present, and we are testing position5)

We avoid R,A,E,L,U,H.

So it should be fine.

We can also consider ""YONIC"", but Y is less common.

I think TONIC is better.

So we'll go with TONIC.

But note: we have to make sure that C is not in position4? In TONIC, C is in position5, which is not forbidden. We only know C is not in 1,3,4. Position3 is N, so C can be in 2 or 5. Position5 is allowed.

Similarly, for position2, we are not putting C there in this guess.

But we are testing position5 for C.

If we get feedback that C is in the correct position, then we know it's position5. If not, then C must be in position2.

But in this guess, we are putting C in position5.

So let's do that.

Guess: TONIC

But wait, is there a word that tests position2 for C? We could, but we are also testing other letters.

Alternatively, we could use a word with C in position2, but we had trouble finding one.

Another word: ""SCONE"" but E is absent.

""SCUBA"" but U and A absent.

I think TONIC is acceptable.

So we'll go with TONIC.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is present but not in position 1.  
  - R, A, E are absent.  
  - N is present but not in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: LUNCH** → Feedback: L(x) U(x) N(✓) C(-) H(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - L, U, H are absent.  
  - N is correct and in position 3.  
  - C is present but not in position 4.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - **N** is in the word and fixed in **position 3**.  
   - **C** is present but cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from feedback). Thus, C must be in position 2 or 5.  
2. **Absent Letters**: R, A, E, L, U, H (cannot appear in the word).  
3. **Word Structure**: The secret word has the pattern `_ _ N _ _`, with C in position 2 or 5.  
4. **Goal for Next Guess**:  
   - Test C in position 5 (since position 2 is also possible, but position 5 allows testing new letters).  
   - Introduce new common letters (e.g., O, I, T, S) to gather more information.  
   - Avoid absent letters and forbidden positions for C.

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- **TONIC** is chosen because:  
  - Fits the pattern `T O N I C`:  
    - Position 3 is N (correct, as required).  
    - C is placed in position 5 (tests the possibility that C is in position 5; if wrong, C must be in position 2).  
  - Uses new, common letters:  
    - T (common consonant, untested).  
    - O and I (common vowels, untested).  
  - Avoids all absent letters (R, A, E, L, U, H).  
- If feedback shows C(✓) in position 5, we confirm C's position. If C(-), we know C must be in position 2. Feedback on T, O, and I will also reveal their presence/absence.

So ""CLINT"" has C in pos1, which we must avoid).\nAlternatively, words with C in positions 2-5.\n\nFor example:\n- Position 2: Having C as second letter: words like ""SCENT"", but note E is ruled out, so no.\n- We avoid A, E, R.\n\nTry words with C in position 3? For example, ""TOPIC"", but O and I are new, and note we already know E is absent. Wait, let\'s try to find words without E.\n\nList of words without A, E, R and also without the letters we know are absent (R,A,E).\n\nPossible: O, U, I, B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nBut we need to include C and N.\n\nLet me try to think of words that have C and N, and without A, E, R.\n\nExamples:\n- Music? -> has E? No, MUSIC: M,U,S,I,C -> but C is in position5, N is missing? Wait, we need N.\n\nMust have both C and N.\n\nWords:\n- CLUNG: C,L,U,N,G -> positions: C in 1? but C cannot be in pos1. So if we use CLUNG, we must ensure C isn\'t in position 1? Wait, CLUNG has C in 1 -> invalid because we know C cannot be in 1.\n- LUNCH: L,U,N,C,H -> C in position 4, N in position 3 -> avoids known A,E,R.\n  - Check positions: \n    - N is in position 3? We don\'t know if position3 is allowed for N. Since in the first guess N was in position4 and that was wrong, but N could be in position3. Similarly, C is in position4, which we don\'t know yet if that position is forbidden for C? Only position1 is forbidden for C.\n  - This seems good: LUNCH introduces L, U, H.\n  - We are testing new letters: L, U, H.\n\nAnother option: ""PUNCH"" -> P,U,N,C,H -> similar to LUNCH, but starting with P.\n\nOr ""BUNCH"" -> B,U,N,C,H.\n\nBut each of these might be good.\n\nWe want a word that doesn\'t repeat the positions of C and N incorrectly? Since we know C isn\'t in 1 and N isn\'t in 4, we must avoid those positions.\n\nIn LUNCH (L-U-N-C-H):\n- Position1: L (new)\n- Position2: U (new vowel)\n- Position3: N (N is here; in the first guess, N was in position4 and not correct, but now we put N in position3 -> okay because position3 might be correct? We don\'t know, but we\'re testing)\n- Position4: C (C was in position1 before, now we move it to position4 -> might be correct)\n- Position5: H (new)\n\nThis is acceptable because we avoid C in position1 and N in position4.\n\nSimilarly, ""BUNCH"" is B,U,N,C,H.\n\nAnother word: ""CONCH"" -> but O is new, and letters: C,O,N,C,H -> oh, it has double C? That might be problematic because we don\'t know if the word has two C\'s. But our feedback only showed one C? Actually, the feedback showed that C is present, but it might be one or more. However, we don\'t know. We should avoid double letters for now to maximize information.\n\nSimilarly, ""LUNCH"" doesn\'t repeat letters, so it\'s good.\n\nWe can also consider ""SYNCH"", but S,Y are new.\n\nBut let me look for other words without A, E, R and with C and N.\n\nAnother one: ""DUNCE"" -> but E is absent, so we can\'t use that.\n\n""FLINC"" is not a word.\n\n""INCOG"" not common.\n\n""MINCY"" -> M,I,N,C,Y -> without A,E,R -> letters: M,I,N,C,Y -> but Y is less common.\n\nBut let\'s choose something with common letters.\n\nI think ""LUNCH"" is a good candidate because:\n- It uses C and N in positions we haven\'t tried (C in position4, N in position3).\n- It introduces three new letters: L, U, H.\n\nWe can then get feedback on L, U, H and whether C in 4 or N in 3 are correct.\n\nAnother possibility: ""HUNCH"" -> same as LUNCH but with H at start? H in pos1, but we don\'t know.\n\nBut ""LUNCH"" is more standard.\n\nAlternatively, ""PUNCH"" or ""BUNCH"" are also common.\n\nI\'ll go with ""LUNCH"".\n\nBut note: we have two constraints:\n1.

- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2) (✓)
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3) (✓)
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) (✓)
- C is in the word and in the correct position (position 5) (✓)

So, from all feedback:

We know the secret word has:
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: C

And we know that position 1 is not T (and T is absent).

Also, from previous feedback, we know that:
- R, A, E, L, U, H are absent (from Guess1 and Guess2).

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ O N I C

We only need to find the first letter.

Constraints for the first letter:
- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""ONIC"".
- It cannot be any of the absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H, T (and also not the ones we know are absent from previous: R,A,E,L,U,H,T).

We have not tested many other letters. We should consider common consonants for the first position.

Possible words ending with ""ONIC"":
- CONIC: but C is already in position 5? And we know C is in position 5, but in CONIC, position1 is C and position5 is C. However, we don't know if the word has two C's? But in our feedback for TONIC, we have C(✓) in position5, but we don't have information about other C's. However, in the first guess, CRANE, we had C(-) meaning C is present but not in position1. So if the word were CONIC, then C is in position1 and position5. But the feedback from CRANE said C is present but not in position1, which would be inconsistent if CONIC had C in position1. Therefore, CONIC is invalid because it would require C in position1, which we know is not allowed.

Similarly, other words:
- TONIC: we tried, and T is absent.
- SONIC: S is not in the absent list, so possible.
- IONIC: I is already in position4, but we don't know if I can be repeated? The feedback doesn't say anything about multiple I's. But in TONIC, we had I in position4 and it was correct. If we use IONIC, then position1 is I and position4 is I. We don't have feedback that I is absent, so it might be possible. However, we haven't tested for multiple I's.

But let's list all possible 5-letter words ending with ""ONIC"":

Common ones:
- CONIC (invalid because C in position1 is forbidden)
- TONIC (T is absent, so invalid)
- IONIC
- SONIC
- BONIC? (not common, but Bionic is 6 letters)
- MONIC
- DONIC? (not common)
- PONIC? (not common)

More common: SONIC, IONIC, and perhaps MONIC (as in the root of ""harmonic"" but not typically used alone?).

But ""MONIC"" is a valid word (e.g., in mathematics).

Similarly, ""IONIC"" is common.

Also, ""SONIC"" is common.

Now, we must avoid the absent letters: R,A,E,L,U,H,T.

So for the first letter, it cannot be R,A,E,L,U,H,T.

Possible first letters for words ending with ""ONIC"": 
- S (SONIC)
- I (IONIC)
- M (MONIC)
- Y (YONIC) - less common
- Z (ZONIC) - not common

We should choose among S, I, M.

But note: in IONIC, the first letter is I, and we already have I in position4. We don't know if the word allows duplicate letters. However, we haven't had any feedback suggesting that I is duplicated. But it's possible.

Similarly, in SONIC, S is new and not tested.

In MONIC, M is new.

We need to test one of these.

But we have to make a guess that is a valid word.

Since we have three possibilities, we can choose the most common one.

But note: we have only one guess? Actually, we have more tries, but we want to solve it.

We can choose SONIC because it uses a new letter S.

But let's see the feedback from TONIC: we have O(✓), N(✓), I(✓), C(✓), and T(x). So the only missing is position1.

We don't have any information about S or M.

But if we guess SONIC, and if it's correct, we win. If not, then we know it's not S, and we can try another.

Similarly for IONIC.

But IONIC has I in position1 and position4. We don't know if that's allowed. The secret word might have duplicate letters? We haven't encountered any duplicate so far, but it's possible.

However, to be safe, we might avoid duplicates for now and try SONIC.

But let's check the frequency: SONIC is a very common word.

Alternatively, we can consider that in the first guess, we had no duplicate letters, and in the second and third also, so maybe the secret word has no duplicates. But we don't know.

But to maximize the chance, we can try SONIC.

Another idea: we know that the first letter cannot be a vowel? Not necessarily, but let's see.

Vowels we have: O and I are already in the word. We don't have A, E, U (absent). So the first letter must be a consonant? Not necessarily, because Y might be possible, but we haven't tested Y.

But in the common words, SONIC, IONIC, MONIC, the first letter of SONIC and MONIC are consonants, IONIC is vowel.

But we can try SONIC.

We also have to consider that we have only 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess.

But let's list the possibilities:

- If we guess SONIC and it's correct, we win.
- If not, then we know S is absent, and then we can try IONIC or MONIC.

But if we guess IONIC and it's wrong, we lose a guess.

Similarly for MONIC.

But note: if we guess a word that has a new letter, we get more information.

But in this case, since we know four letters, we can try to guess the word directly.

The most common words are SONIC and IONIC.

But IONIC has two I's, which might be less common.

So I think SONIC is a better guess.

We can also consider that in the feedback, we have no indication of duplicate letters, so the secret word might have all distinct letters. In that case, IONIC would be invalid because of two I's.

Therefore, SONIC and MONIC are better.

Between SONIC and MONIC, SONIC is more common.

So we'll go with SONIC.

But let's confirm: SONIC: S-O-N-I-C

Position1: S (new, not absent)
Position2: O (correct)
Position3: N (correct)
Position4: I (correct)
Position5: C (correct)

And it avoids absent letters.

So if the secret word is SONIC, we win.

If not, then S is absent, and we can try MONIC next.

But there might be other words like CONIC, but we know CONIC is invalid because of C in position1.

TONIC is invalid because T is absent.

What about ""BONIC""? Not common, but if we must, but let's stick to common words.

Another word: ""ZONIC"" is not common.

So I think SONIC is the best guess.

Therefore, we guess SONIC.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
     - C is present but not in position 1 (C(-)).
     - R, A, E are absent (R(x), A(x), E(x)).
     - N is present but not in position 4 (N(-)).
   - **Guess 2 (LUNCH)**:
     - L, U, H are absent (L(x), U(x), H(x)).
     - N is correct and in position 3 (N(✓)).
     - C is present but not in position 4 (C(-)).
   - **Guess 3 (TONIC)**:
     - T is absent (T(x)).
     - O is correct and in position 2 (O(✓)).
     - N is correct and in position 3 (N(✓)).
     - I is correct and in position 4 (I(✓)).
     - C is correct and in position 5 (C(✓)).

2. **Key Insights**:
   - **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
     - Position 2: **O**
     - Position 3: **N**
     - Position 4: **I**
     - Position 5: **C**
   - **Absent Letters**: R, A, E, L, U, H, T (cannot appear in the word).
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word must be of the form `_ O N I C` (only position 1 is unknown).
   - **Constraints for Position 1**:
     - Must form a valid English word with ""ONIC"".
     - Cannot be any absent letter (R, A, E, L, U, H, T).
     - Should be a common consonant or vowel not yet tested (e.g., S, M, B, P, G, Y).

3. **Generate Possible Words**:
   - Common 5-letter words ending in ""ONIC"":
     - **SONIC**: Starts with S (untested, common).
     - **IONIC**: Starts with I (but I is already in position 4; possible duplicate, but less likely).
     - **MONIC**: Starts with M (untested, less common than SONIC).
     - **Other options** (e.g., CONIC, BONIC) are invalid:
       - CONIC has C in position 1 (forbidden by Guess 1 feedback: C(-)).
       - BONIC is uncommon/not standard.

4. **Select the Best Guess**:
   - **SONIC** is optimal because:
     - It tests the most common valid word (`S O N I C`).
     - Uses S (a high-frequency consonant) for position 1.
     - Avoids duplicates (unlike IONIC, which repeats I).
     - If correct, we solve the puzzle. If incorrect, we learn if S is present/absent, narrowing options to rarer words like MONIC.

5. **Final Decision**:
   - Guess **SONIC** to efficiently test the remaining unknown (position 1) while leveraging known positions and absent letters.

<guess>SONIC</guess>",SONIC,"We are given feedback from the third guess: TONIC -> T(x) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓)

- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3) (✓)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word often contains common letters and has a balanced set of vowels and consonants.

 A commonly recommended starting word for Wordle is ""CRANE"". It has 3 consonants and 2 vowels, and the letters are fairly common.

 Alternatively, ""SALET"" or ""ROATE"" are also good. But we'll go with ""CRANE"" for its balance.

 Let's use: CRANE

 So our first guess is ""CRANE"".<thinking>
We need to make the first guess for a 5-letter word game with no prior information. The goal is to maximize the information we get about the secret word. 

A strong first guess should:
- Cover common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to test vowel placements
- Include common consonants (like R, S, T, N) that appear frequently in English words
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities

Considering these factors, ""CRANE"" is an excellent starting word:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N)
- Covers 5 distinct letters
- Uses C, R, A, N, E – all top-tier frequency letters in English

We'll use ""CRANE"" as the initial guess to gather feedback on letter positions/presence efficiently.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is present in the secret word but not in position 1 (since we have '-' meaning wrong position)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is present but not in position 4 (wrong position)
- E is not in the word (x)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters C and N, but not in their guessed positions (position 1 and 4, respectively).
- The secret word does not contain R, A, or E.

Therefore, the secret word has C and N, and it does not have R, A, E.

We must make a new guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word.
- Contains C and N (since they are present).
- Does not contain R, A, E.
- Places C not in position 1 and N not in position 4.

Considering these constraints, we can brainstorm words that have C and N, and avoid R, A, E.

Let's think of common letters that are still possible. Since we know only C and N are present so far, we need to cover other vowels and consonants.

We know the word must have a C, but not in position 1. Also, it has an N, not in position 4.

Possible positions for C: 2, 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (since not position 4).

We also need to include other letters to test. We should avoid R, A, E.

Alternative vowels: O, U, I (and sometimes Y? but we'll avoid Y for now as it is less common).

Common consonants we haven't tested: S, T, L, D, etc.

One approach is to choose a word that uses the known letters (C and N) in new positions and introduces new letters to test.

We can consider words like:
- ""CLINT"" (but note T is new, and the positions: C in pos1? but we know C cannot be in pos1 because feedback for C was '-' meaning present but not in pos1. So ""CLINT"" has C in pos1, which we must avoid).
Alternatively, words with C in positions 2-5.

For example:
- Position 2: Having C as second letter: words like ""SCENT"", but note E is ruled out, so no.
- We avoid A, E, R.

Try words with C in position 3? For example, ""TOPIC"", but O and I are new, and note we already know E is absent. Wait, let's try to find words without E.

List of words without A, E, R and also without the letters we know are absent (R,A,E).

Possible: O, U, I, B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, etc.

But we need to include C and N.

Let me try to think of words that have C and N, and without A, E, R.

Examples:
- Music? -> has E? No, MUSIC: M,U,S,I,C -> but C is in position5, N is missing? Wait, we need N.

Must have both C and N.

Words:
- CLUNG: C,L,U,N,G -> positions: C in 1? but C cannot be in pos1. So if we use CLUNG, we must ensure C isn't in position 1? Wait, CLUNG has C in 1 -> invalid because we know C cannot be in 1.
- LUNCH: L,U,N,C,H -> C in position 4, N in position 3 -> avoids known A,E,R.
  - Check positions: 
    - N is in position 3? We don't know if position3 is allowed for N. Since in the first guess N was in position4 and that was wrong, but N could be in position3. Similarly, C is in position4, which we don't know yet if that position is forbidden for C? Only position1 is forbidden for C.
  - This seems good: LUNCH introduces L, U, H.
  - We are testing new letters: L, U, H.

Another option: ""PUNCH"" -> P,U,N,C,H -> similar to LUNCH, but starting with P.

Or ""BUNCH"" -> B,U,N,C,H.

But each of these might be good.

We want a word that doesn't repeat the positions of C and N incorrectly? Since we know C isn't in 1 and N isn't in 4, we must avoid those positions.

In LUNCH (L-U-N-C-H):
- Position1: L (new)
- Position2: U (new vowel)
- Position3: N (N is here; in the first guess, N was in position4 and not correct, but now we put N in position3 -> okay because position3 might be correct? We don't know, but we're testing)
- Position4: C (C was in position1 before, now we move it to position4 -> might be correct)
- Position5: H (new)

This is acceptable because we avoid C in position1 and N in position4.

Similarly, ""BUNCH"" is B,U,N,C,H.

Another word: ""CONCH"" -> but O is new, and letters: C,O,N,C,H -> oh, it has double C? That might be problematic because we don't know if the word has two C's. But our feedback only showed one C? Actually, the feedback showed that C is present, but it might be one or more. However, we don't know. We should avoid double letters for now to maximize information.

Similarly, ""LUNCH"" doesn't repeat letters, so it's good.

We can also consider ""SYNCH"", but S,Y are new.

But let me look for other words without A, E, R and with C and N.

Another one: ""DUNCE"" -> but E is absent, so we can't use that.

""FLINC"" is not a word.

""INCOG"" not common.

""MINCY"" -> M,I,N,C,Y -> without A,E,R -> letters: M,I,N,C,Y -> but Y is less common.

But let's choose something with common letters.

I think ""LUNCH"" is a good candidate because:
- It uses C and N in positions we haven't tried (C in position4, N in position3).
- It introduces three new letters: L, U, H.

We can then get feedback on L, U, H and whether C in 4 or N in 3 are correct.

Another possibility: ""HUNCH"" -> same as LUNCH but with H at start? H in pos1, but we don't know.

But ""LUNCH"" is more standard.

Alternatively, ""PUNCH"" or ""BUNCH"" are also common.

I'll go with ""LUNCH"".

But note: we have two constraints:
1. C must not be in position1 -> okay, in LUNCH, C is in position4.
2. N must not be in position4 -> okay, in LUNCH, N is in position3.

So it meets the constraints.

Therefore, guess: LUNCH

Let's write it in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (indicated by ""-"")
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (indicated by ""-"")
- R, A, and E are not in the word at all (indicated by ""x"")

Constraints for the next guess:
- Must include C and N (since they are present in the secret word).
- C cannot be in position 1.
- N cannot be in position 4.
- Must exclude R, A, and E (since they are absent).
- Should introduce new common vowels/consonants to test.

Considering these, ""LUNCH"" is a suitable guess:
- Contains C (in position 4) and N (in position 3), satisfying both presence requirements and avoiding forbidden positions.
- Includes L, U, and H as new letters to test, covering common vowels/consonants.
- Adheres to English word rules and avoids excluded letters (R, A, E).

<thinking>
The goal is to gather more information about the secret word. ""LUNCH"" efficiently positions the known letters (C and N) in new slots (avoiding positions 1 and 4) while testing unused vowels/consonants (L, U, H). Feedback will clarify:
- Accuracy of U (potential vowel) and L/H (common consonants).
- Whether N in position 3 or C in position 4 is correct.
- Any additional present letters.
</thinking>

<guess>LUNCH</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: LUNCH -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(x) N(✓) C(-) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the second guess: LUNCH -> L(x) U(x) N(✓) C(-) H(x)

Interpretation:
- L is not in the word (x)
- U is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3) (✓)
- C is in the word but not in position 4 (since we have '-' meaning wrong position)
- H is not in the word (x)

So, from all feedback so far:

From Guess 1 (CRANE):
- C is present, but not in position 1.
- R, A, E are absent.
- N is present, but not in position 4.

From Guess 2 (LUNCH):
- N is in the correct position (position 3).
- C is present, but not in position 4.
- L, U, H are absent.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter N in position 3.
- The secret word has the letter C, but not in position 1 or 4 (from Guess1 and Guess2).
- Absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H.

We must make a new guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word.
- Has N in position 3.
- Contains the letter C, but not in position 1, 4, or 3 (because position 3 is taken by N, so C can't be there). Also, from Guess1, C is not in position1, and from Guess2, C is not in position4. So C must be in position 2 or 5.
- Does not contain R, A, E, L, U, H.

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters to test.

Possible positions for C: only 2 or 5.

Let's consider the word structure: _ _ N _ _

We need to put C in position 2 or 5.

We also need to choose letters for positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 (but if C is in 2, then position 2 is C, and we need 1,4,5; if C is in 5, then we need 1,2,4).

We should avoid the absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H.

Available letters: we haven't tested many consonants and vowels. We should test common vowels: O, I, and sometimes Y. Consonants: S, T, D, M, P, B, G, K, etc.

We can consider two cases: C in position 2 or C in position 5.

First, let's try with C in position 2: so the word is _ C N _ _

We need to choose position 1, 4, and 5 without R,A,E,L,U,H.

Possible words:
- ICONS: I in pos1, C in pos2, N in pos3, S in pos4, but we need a 5th letter? Wait, ICONS is 5 letters: I-C-O-N-S -> but N is in pos4? We need N in pos3. So not.

We need N in pos3, so for a word like _ C N _ _

Examples:
- SCION: S-C-I-O-N -> but S in pos1, C in pos2, I in pos3? No, we need N in pos3. SCION has I in pos3 and N in pos5 -> not matching.

We need the third letter to be N.

Another: BACON? But A is absent, and B is possible? But A is absent, so no.

Let me think of words with the pattern _ C N _ _

Without A, E, R, L, U, H.

Possible:
- ACORN: but A is absent -> invalid.
- ICING: I-C-I-N-G -> but position3 is I, not N -> no.
- We need position3 to be N.

What about ""SCENT""? But E is absent -> invalid.

""OCEAN"" -> E and A absent.

It's tricky.

Perhaps ""CYTON""? Not common.

Another idea: ""MUCIN""? But U is absent.

Maybe we should consider C in position 5.

So the word is _ _ N _ C

Now, we need to fill positions 1,2,4 without R,A,E,L,U,H.

And position5 is C.

Examples:
- POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> but position3 is I, not N -> no.
- We need position3 to be N, so _ _ N _ C

Like: 
- BONEC? Not a word.
- CONIC? But C in position1? We know C cannot be in position1. Also, CONIC has C in position1 and position5? But position1 is forbidden for C.

We must avoid C in position1.

So for pattern _ _ N _ C, position1 cannot be C.

Words:
- POINC? Not a word.
- JOINC? No.
- MINCE? But E is absent -> invalid.
- DANCE? A and E absent -> invalid.
- PINCH? But H is absent -> invalid.

This is difficult. Maybe we need to consider that C might be in position2.

Let me search for words with N in position3 and C in position2.

Pattern: ? C N ? ?

Without A,E,R,L,U,H.

Possible words:
- SCENE? E is absent -> no.
- SCONE? O is new, but E is absent -> no.
- SCANT? A is absent -> no.
- SCINT? Not a word.
- Maybe ""CYANI""? Not common.

Another: ""OCTAN""? But A is absent.

Perhaps we are missing some words. Let's think of common words.

""ACING"" -> A absent.

""ICING"" -> position3 is I, not N.

Wait, what about ""CON"" words? But C cannot be in position1.

Perhaps ""MCN"" something? Like ""MCNUG""? Not a word.

Maybe we should consider that the word might have the letter C in position5 and use a word that tests that.

Let me list possible words that have N in position3 and contain C, without the absent letters.

We can use a word that has C in position5 and N in position3.

For example, ""TONIC"": T-O-N-I-C -> 
- Position1: T
- Position2: O
- Position3: N (correct, as required)
- Position4: I
- Position5: C

Now, check absent letters: T, O, I are not in the absent list (R,A,E,L,U,H are absent, but T,O,I are new and allowed).

So ""TONIC"" seems valid.

Also, C is in position5, which is allowed (since we only know C is not in 1,3,4; position3 is taken by N, so C can be in 2 or 5, and 5 is fine).

Similarly, we avoid the absent letters.

Another possibility: ""CONIC"" but C in position1 is forbidden.

""IONIC"": I-O-N-I-C -> position1: I, position2: O, position3: N, position4: I, position5: C. This also works, but has double I? But that's okay if the word allows.

But ""TONIC"" is more common.

""MANIC"": but A is absent -> invalid.

""PANIC"": A absent.

""SONIC"": S-O-N-I-C -> S is new, O, I, C. Absent letters don't include S,O,I.

So ""SONIC"" is also possible.

But we have two options: TONIC and SONIC.

We can choose one that tests more common letters.

We also need to consider that we haven't tested S or T yet.

Both are good.

But note: in TONIC, we test T, O, I, and C (C we know is present, but position5 is new).

Similarly, SONIC tests S, O, I, C.

We might also consider ""BONUS"" but U is absent and S is in position5, but we need C in the word? We must include C because it is present.

The guess must include C, since we know C is in the word.

So we cannot use ""BONUS"" because it doesn't have C.

Similarly, we must have C in the guess.

So TONIC and SONIC are both valid.

Let's choose TONIC to test T and O.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

Another word: ""CONKY""? Not common and C in position1 forbidden.

""PUNCH"" we already did, but U and H absent.

I think TONIC is a good choice.

But let's confirm the feedback constraints.

In TONIC:
- Position1: T (new)
- Position2: O (new)
- Position3: N (correct, we know)
- Position4: I (new)
- Position5: C (we know C is present, and we are testing position5)

We avoid R,A,E,L,U,H.

So it should be fine.

We can also consider ""YONIC"", but Y is less common.

I think TONIC is better.

So we'll go with TONIC.

But note: we have to make sure that C is not in position4? In TONIC, C is in position5, which is not forbidden. We only know C is not in 1,3,4. Position3 is N, so C can be in 2 or 5. Position5 is allowed.

Similarly, for position2, we are not putting C there in this guess.

But we are testing position5 for C.

If we get feedback that C is in the correct position, then we know it's position5. If not, then C must be in position2.

But in this guess, we are putting C in position5.

So let's do that.

Guess: TONIC

But wait, is there a word that tests position2 for C? We could, but we are also testing other letters.

Alternatively, we could use a word with C in position2, but we had trouble finding one.

Another word: ""SCONE"" but E is absent.

""SCUBA"" but U and A absent.

I think TONIC is acceptable.

So we'll go with TONIC.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is present but not in position 1.  
  - R, A, E are absent.  
  - N is present but not in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: LUNCH** → Feedback: L(x) U(x) N(✓) C(-) H(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - L, U, H are absent.  
  - N is correct and in position 3.  
  - C is present but not in position 4.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - **N** is in the word and fixed in **position 3**.  
   - **C** is present but cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from feedback). Thus, C must be in position 2 or 5.  
2. **Absent Letters**: R, A, E, L, U, H (cannot appear in the word).  
3. **Word Structure**: The secret word has the pattern `_ _ N _ _`, with C in position 2 or 5.  
4. **Goal for Next Guess**:  
   - Test C in position 5 (since position 2 is also possible, but position 5 allows testing new letters).  
   - Introduce new common letters (e.g., O, I, T, S) to gather more information.  
   - Avoid absent letters and forbidden positions for C.

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- **TONIC** is chosen because:  
  - Fits the pattern `T O N I C`:  
    - Position 3 is N (correct, as required).  
    - C is placed in position 5 (tests the possibility that C is in position 5; if wrong, C must be in position 2).  
  - Uses new, common letters:  
    - T (common consonant, untested).  
    - O and I (common vowels, untested).  
  - Avoids all absent letters (R, A, E, L, U, H).  
- If feedback shows C(✓) in position 5, we confirm C's position. If C(-), we know C must be in position 2. Feedback on T, O, and I will also reveal their presence/absence.

<guess>TONIC</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: LUNCH -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(x) N(✓) C(-) H(x)
Guess 3: TONIC -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the third guess: TONIC -> T(x) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓)

Interpretation:
- T is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2) (✓)
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3) (✓)
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) (✓)
- C is in the word and in the correct position (position 5) (✓)

So, from all feedback:

We know the secret word has:
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: C

And we know that position 1 is not T (and T is absent).

Also, from previous feedback, we know that:
- R, A, E, L, U, H are absent (from Guess1 and Guess2).

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ O N I C

We only need to find the first letter.

Constraints for the first letter:
- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""ONIC"".
- It cannot be any of the absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H, T (and also not the ones we know are absent from previous: R,A,E,L,U,H,T).

We have not tested many other letters. We should consider common consonants for the first position.

Possible words ending with ""ONIC"":
- CONIC: but C is already in position 5? And we know C is in position 5, but in CONIC, position1 is C and position5 is C. However, we don't know if the word has two C's? But in our feedback for TONIC, we have C(✓) in position5, but we don't have information about other C's. However, in the first guess, CRANE, we had C(-) meaning C is present but not in position1. So if the word were CONIC, then C is in position1 and position5. But the feedback from CRANE said C is present but not in position1, which would be inconsistent if CONIC had C in position1. Therefore, CONIC is invalid because it would require C in position1, which we know is not allowed.

Similarly, other words:
- TONIC: we tried, and T is absent.
- SONIC: S is not in the absent list, so possible.
- IONIC: I is already in position4, but we don't know if I can be repeated? The feedback doesn't say anything about multiple I's. But in TONIC, we had I in position4 and it was correct. If we use IONIC, then position1 is I and position4 is I. We don't have feedback that I is absent, so it might be possible. However, we haven't tested for multiple I's.

But let's list all possible 5-letter words ending with ""ONIC"":

Common ones:
- CONIC (invalid because C in position1 is forbidden)
- TONIC (T is absent, so invalid)
- IONIC
- SONIC
- BONIC? (not common, but Bionic is 6 letters)
- MONIC
- DONIC? (not common)
- PONIC? (not common)

More common: SONIC, IONIC, and perhaps MONIC (as in the root of ""harmonic"" but not typically used alone?).

But ""MONIC"" is a valid word (e.g., in mathematics).

Similarly, ""IONIC"" is common.

Also, ""SONIC"" is common.

Now, we must avoid the absent letters: R,A,E,L,U,H,T.

So for the first letter, it cannot be R,A,E,L,U,H,T.

Possible first letters for words ending with ""ONIC"": 
- S (SONIC)
- I (IONIC)
- M (MONIC)
- Y (YONIC) - less common
- Z (ZONIC) - not common

We should choose among S, I, M.

But note: in IONIC, the first letter is I, and we already have I in position4. We don't know if the word allows duplicate letters. However, we haven't had any feedback suggesting that I is duplicated. But it's possible.

Similarly, in SONIC, S is new and not tested.

In MONIC, M is new.

We need to test one of these.

But we have to make a guess that is a valid word.

Since we have three possibilities, we can choose the most common one.

But note: we have only one guess? Actually, we have more tries, but we want to solve it.

We can choose SONIC because it uses a new letter S.

But let's see the feedback from TONIC: we have O(✓), N(✓), I(✓), C(✓), and T(x). So the only missing is position1.

We don't have any information about S or M.

But if we guess SONIC, and if it's correct, we win. If not, then we know it's not S, and we can try another.

Similarly for IONIC.

But IONIC has I in position1 and position4. We don't know if that's allowed. The secret word might have duplicate letters? We haven't encountered any duplicate so far, but it's possible.

However, to be safe, we might avoid duplicates for now and try SONIC.

But let's check the frequency: SONIC is a very common word.

Alternatively, we can consider that in the first guess, we had no duplicate letters, and in the second and third also, so maybe the secret word has no duplicates. But we don't know.

But to maximize the chance, we can try SONIC.

Another idea: we know that the first letter cannot be a vowel? Not necessarily, but let's see.

Vowels we have: O and I are already in the word. We don't have A, E, U (absent). So the first letter must be a consonant? Not necessarily, because Y might be possible, but we haven't tested Y.

But in the common words, SONIC, IONIC, MONIC, the first letter of SONIC and MONIC are consonants, IONIC is vowel.

But we can try SONIC.

We also have to consider that we have only 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess.

But let's list the possibilities:

- If we guess SONIC and it's correct, we win.
- If not, then we know S is absent, and then we can try IONIC or MONIC.

But if we guess IONIC and it's wrong, we lose a guess.

Similarly for MONIC.

But note: if we guess a word that has a new letter, we get more information.

But in this case, since we know four letters, we can try to guess the word directly.

The most common words are SONIC and IONIC.

But IONIC has two I's, which might be less common.

So I think SONIC is a better guess.

We can also consider that in the feedback, we have no indication of duplicate letters, so the secret word might have all distinct letters. In that case, IONIC would be invalid because of two I's.

Therefore, SONIC and MONIC are better.

Between SONIC and MONIC, SONIC is more common.

So we'll go with SONIC.

But let's confirm: SONIC: S-O-N-I-C

Position1: S (new, not absent)
Position2: O (correct)
Position3: N (correct)
Position4: I (correct)
Position5: C (correct)

And it avoids absent letters.

So if the secret word is SONIC, we win.

If not, then S is absent, and we can try MONIC next.

But there might be other words like CONIC, but we know CONIC is invalid because of C in position1.

TONIC is invalid because T is absent.

What about ""BONIC""? Not common, but if we must, but let's stick to common words.

Another word: ""ZONIC"" is not common.

So I think SONIC is the best guess.

Therefore, we guess SONIC.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
     - C is present but not in position 1 (C(-)).
     - R, A, E are absent (R(x), A(x), E(x)).
     - N is present but not in position 4 (N(-)).
   - **Guess 2 (LUNCH)**:
     - L, U, H are absent (L(x), U(x), H(x)).
     - N is correct and in position 3 (N(✓)).
     - C is present but not in position 4 (C(-)).
   - **Guess 3 (TONIC)**:
     - T is absent (T(x)).
     - O is correct and in position 2 (O(✓)).
     - N is correct and in position 3 (N(✓)).
     - I is correct and in position 4 (I(✓)).
     - C is correct and in position 5 (C(✓)).

2. **Key Insights**:
   - **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
     - Position 2: **O**
     - Position 3: **N**
     - Position 4: **I**
     - Position 5: **C**
   - **Absent Letters**: R, A, E, L, U, H, T (cannot appear in the word).
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word must be of the form `_ O N I C` (only position 1 is unknown).
   - **Constraints for Position 1**:
     - Must form a valid English word with ""ONIC"".
     - Cannot be any absent letter (R, A, E, L, U, H, T).
     - Should be a common consonant or vowel not yet tested (e.g., S, M, B, P, G, Y).

3. **Generate Possible Words**:
   - Common 5-letter words ending in ""ONIC"":
     - **SONIC**: Starts with S (untested, common).
     - **IONIC**: Starts with I (but I is already in position 4; possible duplicate, but less likely).
     - **MONIC**: Starts with M (untested, less common than SONIC).
     - **Other options** (e.g., CONIC, BONIC) are invalid:
       - CONIC has C in position 1 (forbidden by Guess 1 feedback: C(-)).
       - BONIC is uncommon/not standard.

4. **Select the Best Guess**:
   - **SONIC** is optimal because:
     - It tests the most common valid word (`S O N I C`).
     - Uses S (a high-frequency consonant) for position 1.
     - Avoids duplicates (unlike IONIC, which repeats I).
     - If correct, we solve the puzzle. If incorrect, we learn if S is present/absent, narrowing options to rarer words like MONIC.

5. **Final Decision**:
   - Guess **SONIC** to efficiently test the remaining unknown (position 1) while leveraging known positions and absent letters.

So ""CLINT"" has C in pos1, which we must avoid).\nAlternatively, words with C in positions 2-5.\n\nFor example:\n- Position 2: Having C as second letter: words like ""SCENT"", but note E is ruled out, so no.\n- We avoid A, E, R.\n\nTry words with C in position 3? For example, ""TOPIC"", but O and I are new, and note we already know E is absent. Wait, let\'s try to find words without E.\n\nList of words without A, E, R and also without the letters we know are absent (R,A,E).\n\nPossible: O, U, I, B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nBut we need to include C and N.\n\nLet me try to think of words that have C and N, and without A, E, R.\n\nExamples:\n- Music? -> has E? No, MUSIC: M,U,S,I,C -> but C is in position5, N is missing? Wait, we need N.\n\nMust have both C and N.\n\nWords:\n- CLUNG: C,L,U,N,G -> positions: C in 1? but C cannot be in pos1. So if we use CLUNG, we must ensure C isn\'t in position 1? Wait, CLUNG has C in 1 -> invalid because we know C cannot be in 1.\n- LUNCH: L,U,N,C,H -> C in position 4, N in position 3 -> avoids known A,E,R.\n  - Check positions: \n    - N is in position 3? We don\'t know if position3 is allowed for N. Since in the first guess N was in position4 and that was wrong, but N could be in position3. Similarly, C is in position4, which we don\'t know yet if that position is forbidden for C? Only position1 is forbidden for C.\n  - This seems good: LUNCH introduces L, U, H.\n  - We are testing new letters: L, U, H.\n\nAnother option: ""PUNCH"" -> P,U,N,C,H -> similar to LUNCH, but starting with P.\n\nOr ""BUNCH"" -> B,U,N,C,H.\n\nBut each of these might be good.\n\nWe want a word that doesn\'t repeat the positions of C and N incorrectly? Since we know C isn\'t in 1 and N isn\'t in 4, we must avoid those positions.\n\nIn LUNCH (L-U-N-C-H):\n- Position1: L (new)\n- Position2: U (new vowel)\n- Position3: N (N is here; in the first guess, N was in position4 and not correct, but now we put N in position3 -> okay because position3 might be correct? We don\'t know, but we\'re testing)\n- Position4: C (C was in position1 before, now we move it to position4 -> might be correct)\n- Position5: H (new)\n\nThis is acceptable because we avoid C in position1 and N in position4.\n\nSimilarly, ""BUNCH"" is B,U,N,C,H.\n\nAnother word: ""CONCH"" -> but O is new, and letters: C,O,N,C,H -> oh, it has double C? That might be problematic because we don\'t know if the word has two C\'s. But our feedback only showed one C? Actually, the feedback showed that C is present, but it might be one or more. However, we don\'t know. We should avoid double letters for now to maximize information.\n\nSimilarly, ""LUNCH"" doesn\'t repeat letters, so it\'s good.\n\nWe can also consider ""SYNCH"", but S,Y are new.\n\nBut let me look for other words without A, E, R and with C and N.\n\nAnother one: ""DUNCE"" -> but E is absent, so we can\'t use that.\n\n""FLINC"" is not a word.\n\n""INCOG"" not common.\n\n""MINCY"" -> M,I,N,C,Y -> without A,E,R -> letters: M,I,N,C,Y -> but Y is less common.\n\nBut let\'s choose something with common letters.\n\nI think ""LUNCH"" is a good candidate because:\n- It uses C and N in positions we haven\'t tried (C in position4, N in position3).\n- It introduces three new letters: L, U, H.\n\nWe can then get feedback on L, U, H and whether C in 4 or N in 3 are correct.\n\nAnother possibility: ""HUNCH"" -> same as LUNCH but with H at start? H in pos1, but we don\'t know.\n\nBut ""LUNCH"" is more standard.\n\nAlternatively, ""PUNCH"" or ""BUNCH"" are also common.\n\nI\'ll go with ""LUNCH"".\n\nBut note: we have two constraints:\n1. C must not be in position1 -> okay, in LUNCH, C is in position4.\n2. N must not be in position4 -> okay, in LUNCH, N is in position3.\n\nSo it meets the constraints.\n\nTherefore, guess: LUNCH\n\nLet\'s write it in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C is in the word but not in position 1 (indicated by ""-"")\n- N is in the word but not in position 4 (indicated by ""-"")\n- R, A, and E are not in the word at all (indicated by ""x"")\n\nConstraints for the next guess:\n- Must include C and N (since they are present in the secret word).\n- C cannot be in position 1.\n- N cannot be in position 4.\n- Must exclude R, A, and E (since they are absent).\n- Should introduce new common vowels/consonants to test.\n\nConsidering these, ""LUNCH"" is a suitable guess:\n- Contains C (in position 4) and N (in position 3), satisfying both presence requirements and avoiding forbidden positions.\n- Includes L, U, and H as new letters to test, covering common vowels/consonants.\n- Adheres to English word rules and avoids excluded letters (R, A, E).\n\n<thinking>\nThe goal is to gather more information about the secret word. ""LUNCH"" efficiently positions the known letters (C and N) in new slots (avoiding positions 1 and 4) while testing unused vowels/consonants (L, U, H). Feedback will clarify:\n- Accuracy of U (potential vowel) and L/H (common consonants).\n- Whether N in position 3 or C in position 4 is correct.\n- Any additional present letters.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>LUNCH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: LUNCH -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(x) N(✓) C(-) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the second guess: LUNCH -> L(x) U(x) N(✓) C(-) H(x)\n\nInterpretation:\n- L is not in the word (x)\n- U is not in the word (x)\n- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3) (✓)\n- C is in the word but not in position 4 (since we have \'-\' meaning wrong position)\n- H is not in the word (x)\n\nSo, from all feedback so far:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (CRANE):\n- C is present, but not in position 1.\n- R, A, E are absent.\n- N is present, but not in position 4.\n\nFrom Guess 2 (LUNCH):\n- N is in the correct position (position 3).\n- C is present, but not in position 4.\n- L, U, H are absent.\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The secret word has the letter N in position 3.\n- The secret word has the letter C, but not in position 1 or 4 (from Guess1 and Guess2).\n- Absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H.\n\nWe must make a new guess that:\n- Is a 5-letter word.\n- Has N in position 3.\n- Contains the letter C, but not in position 1, 4, or 3 (because position 3 is taken by N, so C can\'t be there).

We should test common vowels: O, I, and sometimes Y. Consonants: S, T, D, M, P, B, G, K, etc.\n\nWe can consider two cases: C in position 2 or C in position 5.\n\nFirst, let\'s try with C in position 2: so the word is _ C N _ _\n\nWe need to choose position 1, 4, and 5 without R,A,E,L,U,H.\n\nPossible words:\n- ICONS: I in pos1, C in pos2, N in pos3, S in pos4, but we need a 5th letter? Wait, ICONS is 5 letters: I-C-O-N-S -> but N is in pos4? We need N in pos3. So not.\n\nWe need N in pos3, so for a word like _ C N _ _\n\nExamples:\n- SCION: S-C-I-O-N -> but S in pos1, C in pos2, I in pos3? No, we need N in pos3. SCION has I in pos3 and N in pos5 -> not matching.\n\nWe need the third letter to be N.\n\nAnother: BACON? But A is absent, and B is possible? But A is absent, so no.\n\nLet me think of words with the pattern _ C N _ _\n\nWithout A, E, R, L, U, H.\n\nPossible:\n- ACORN: but A is absent -> invalid.\n- ICING: I-C-I-N-G -> but position3 is I, not N -> no.\n- We need position3 to be N.\n\nWhat about ""SCENT""? But E is absent -> invalid.\n\n""OCEAN"" -> E and A absent.\n\nIt\'s tricky.\n\nPerhaps ""CYTON""? Not common.\n\nAnother idea: ""MUCIN""? But U is absent.\n\nMaybe we should consider C in position 5.\n\nSo the word is _ _ N _ C\n\nNow, we need to fill positions 1,2,4 without R,A,E,L,U,H.\n\nAnd position5 is C.\n\nExamples:\n- POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> but position3 is I, not N -> no.\n- We need position3 to be N, so _ _ N _ C\n\nLike: \n- BONEC? Not a word.\n- CONIC? But C in position1? We know C cannot be in position1. Also, CONIC has C in position1 and position5? But position1 is forbidden for C.\n\nWe must avoid C in position1.\n\nSo for pattern _ _ N _ C, position1 cannot be C.\n\nWords:\n- POINC? Not a word.\n- JOINC? No.\n- MINCE? But E is absent -> invalid.\n- DANCE? A and E absent -> invalid.\n- PINCH? But H is absent -> invalid.\n\nThis is difficult. Maybe we need to consider that C might be in position2.\n\nLet me search for words with N in position3 and C in position2.\n\nPattern: ? C N ? ?\n\nWithout A,E,R,L,U,H.\n\nPossible words:\n- SCENE? E is absent -> no.\n- SCONE? O is new, but E is absent -> no.\n- SCANT? A is absent -> no.\n- SCINT? Not a word.\n- Maybe ""CYANI""? Not common.\n\nAnother: ""OCTAN""? But A is absent.\n\nPerhaps we are missing some words. Let\'s think of common words.\n\n""ACING"" -> A absent.\n\n""ICING"" -> position3 is I, not N.\n\nWait, what about ""CON"" words? But C cannot be in position1.\n\nPerhaps ""MCN"" something? Like ""MCNUG""? Not a word.\n\nMaybe we should consider that the word might have the letter C in position5 and use a word that tests that.\n\nLet me list possible words that have N in position3 and contain C, without the absent letters.\n\nWe can use a word that has C in position5 and N in position3.\n\nFor example, ""TONIC"": T-O-N-I-C -> \n- Position1: T\n- Position2: O\n- Position3: N (correct, as required)\n- Position4: I\n- Position5: C\n\nNow, check absent letters: T, O, I are not in the absent list (R,A,E,L,U,H are absent, but T,O,I are new and allowed).\n\nSo ""TONIC"" seems valid.\n\nAlso, C is in position5, which is allowed (since we only know C is not in 1,3,4; position3 is taken by N, so C can be in 2 or 5, and 5 is fine).\n\nSimilarly, we avoid the absent letters.\n\nAnother possibility: ""CONIC"" but C in position1 is forbidden.\n\n""IONIC"": I-O-N-I-C -> position1: I, position2: O, position3: N, position4: I, position5: C. This also works, but has double I? But that\'s okay if the word allows.\n\nBut ""TONIC"" is more common.\n\n""MANIC"": but A is absent -> invalid.\n\n""PANIC"": A absent.\n\n""SONIC"": S-O-N-I-C -> S is new, O, I, C. Absent letters don\'t include S,O,I.\n\nSo ""SONIC"" is also possible.\n\nBut we have two options: TONIC and SONIC.\n\nWe can choose one that tests more common letters.\n\nWe also need to consider that we haven\'t tested S or T yet.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nBut note: in TONIC, we test T, O, I, and C (C we know is present, but position5 is new).\n\nSimilarly, SONIC tests S, O, I, C.\n\nWe might also consider ""BONUS"" but U is absent and S is in position5, but we need C in the word? We must include C because it is present.\n\nThe guess must include C, since we know C is in the word.\n\nSo we cannot use ""BONUS"" because it doesn\'t have C.\n\nSimilarly, we must have C in the guess.\n\nSo TONIC and SONIC are both valid.\n\nLet\'s choose TONIC to test T and O.\n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nAnother word: ""CONKY""? Not common and C in position1 forbidden.\n\n""PUNCH"" we already did, but U and H absent.\n\nI think TONIC is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback constraints.\n\nIn TONIC:\n- Position1: T (new)\n- Position2: O (new)\n- Position3: N (correct, we know)\n- Position4: I (new)\n- Position5: C (we know C is present, and we are testing position5)\n\nWe avoid R,A,E,L,U,H.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nWe can also consider ""YONIC"", but Y is less common.\n\nI think TONIC is better.\n\nSo we\'ll go with TONIC.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that C is not in position4? In TONIC, C is in position5, which is not forbidden. We only know C is not in 1,3,4. Position3 is N, so C can be in 2 or 5. Position5 is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, for position2, we are not putting C there in this guess.\n\nBut we are testing position5 for C.\n\nIf we get feedback that C is in the correct position, then we know it\'s position5. If not, then C must be in position2.\n\nBut in this guess, we are putting C in position5.\n\nSo let\'s do that.\n\nGuess: TONIC\n\nBut wait, is there a word that tests position2 for C? We could, but we are also testing other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word with C in position2, but we had trouble finding one.\n\nAnother word: ""SCONE"" but E is absent.\n\n""SCUBA"" but U and A absent.\n\nI think TONIC is acceptable.\n\nSo we\'ll go with TONIC.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - C is present but not in position 1.  \n  - R, A, E are absent.  \n  - N is present but not in position 4.  \n\n- **Guess 2: LUNCH** → Feedback: L(x) U(x) N(✓) C(-) H(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - L, U, H are absent.  \n  - N is correct and in position 3.  \n  - C is present but not in position 4.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Confirmed Letters**:  \n   - **N** is in the word and fixed in **position 3**.  \n   - **C** is present but cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from feedback). Thus, C must be in position 2 or 5.  \n2. **Absent Letters**: R, A, E, L, U, H (cannot appear in the word).  \n3. **Word Structure**: The secret word has the pattern `_ _ N _ _`, with C in position 2 or 5.  \n4. **Goal for Next Guess**:  \n   - Test C in position 5 (since position 2 is also possible, but position 5 allows testing new letters).  \n   - Introduce new common letters (e.g., O, I, T, S) to gather more information.  \n   - Avoid absent letters and forbidden positions for C.\n\n### Reasoning for the Next Guess:\n- **TONIC** is chosen because:  \n  - Fits the pattern `T O N I C`:  \n    - Position 3 is N (correct, as required).  \n    - C is placed in position 5 (tests the possibility that C is in position 5; if wrong, C must be in position 2).  \n  - Uses new, common letters:  \n    - T (common consonant, untested).  \n    - O and I (common vowels, untested).  \n  - Avoids all absent letters (R, A, E, L, U, H).  \n- If feedback shows C(✓) in position 5, we confirm C\'s position. If C(-), we know C must be in position 2. Feedback on T, O, and I will also reveal their presence/absence.\n\n<guess>TONIC</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: LUNCH -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(x) N(✓) C(-) H(x)\nGuess 3: TONIC -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the third guess: TONIC -> T(x) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓)\n\nInterpretation:\n- T is not in the word (x)\n- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2) (✓)\n- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3) (✓)\n- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) (✓)\n- C is in the word and in the correct position (position 5) (✓)\n\nSo, from all feedback:\n\nWe know the secret word has:\n- Position 2: O\n- Position 3: N\n- Position 4: I\n- Position 5: C\n\nAnd we know that position 1 is not T (and T is absent).\n\nAlso, from previous feedback, we know that:\n- R, A, E, L, U, H are absent (from Guess1 and Guess2).\n\nTherefore, the secret word is of the form: _ O N I C\n\nWe only need to find the first letter.\n\nConstraints for the first letter:\n- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""ONIC"".\n- It cannot be any of the absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H, T (and also not the ones we know are absent from previous: R,A,E,L,U,H,T).\n\nWe have not tested many other letters. We should consider common consonants for the first position.\n\nPossible words ending with ""ONIC"":\n- CONIC: but C is already in position 5? And we know C is in position 5, but in CONIC, position1 is C and position5 is C. However, we don\'t know if the word has two C\'s? But in our feedback for TONIC, we have C(✓) in position5, but we don\'t have information about other C\'s. However, in the first guess, CRANE, we had C(-) meaning C is present but not in position1. So if the word were CONIC, then C is in position1 and position5. But the feedback from CRANE said C is present but not in position1, which would be inconsistent if CONIC had C in position1. Therefore, CONIC is invalid because it would require C in position1, which we know is not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, other words:\n- TONIC: we tried, and T is absent.\n- SONIC: S is not in the absent list, so possible.\n- IONIC: I is already in position4, but we don\'t know if I can be repeated? The feedback doesn\'t say anything about multiple I\'s. But in TONIC, we had I in position4 and it was correct. If we use IONIC, then position1 is I and position4 is I. We don\'t have feedback that I is absent, so it might be possible. However, we haven\'t tested for multiple I\'s.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible 5-letter words ending with ""ONIC"":\n\nCommon ones:\n- CONIC (invalid because C in position1 is forbidden)\n- TONIC (T is absent, so invalid)\n- IONIC\n- SONIC\n- BONIC? (not common, but Bionic is 6 letters)\n- MONIC\n- DONIC? (not common)\n- PONIC? (not common)\n\nMore common: SONIC, IONIC, and perhaps MONIC (as in the root of ""harmonic"" but not typically used alone?).\n\nBut ""MONIC"" is a valid word (e.g., in mathematics).\n\nSimilarly, ""IONIC"" is common.\n\nAlso, ""SONIC"" is common.\n\nNow, we must avoid the absent letters: R,A,E,L,U,H,T.\n\nSo for the first letter, it cannot be R,A,E,L,U,H,T.\n\nPossible first letters for words ending with ""ONIC"": \n- S (SONIC)\n- I (IONIC)\n- M (MONIC)\n- Y (YONIC) - less common\n- Z (ZONIC) - not common\n\nWe should choose among S, I, M.\n\nBut note: in IONIC, the first letter is I, and we already have I in position4. We don\'t know if the word allows duplicate letters. However, we haven\'t had any feedback suggesting that I is duplicated. But it\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly, in SONIC, S is new and not tested.\n\nIn MONIC, M is new.\n\nWe need to test one of these.\n\nBut we have to make a guess that is a valid word.\n\nSince we have three possibilities, we can choose the most common one.\n\nBut note: we have only one guess? Actually, we have more tries, but we want to solve it.\n\nWe can choose SONIC because it uses a new letter S.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback from TONIC: we have O(✓), N(✓), I(✓), C(✓), and T(x). So the only missing is position1.\n\nWe don\'t have any information about S or M.\n\nBut if we guess SONIC, and if it\'s correct, we win. If not, then we know it\'s not S, and we can try another.\n\nSimilarly for IONIC.\n\nBut IONIC has I in position1 and position4. We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. The secret word might have duplicate letters? We haven\'t encountered any duplicate so far, but it\'s possible.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we might avoid duplicates for now and try SONIC.\n\nBut let\'s check the frequency: SONIC is a very common word.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that in the first guess, we had no duplicate letters, and in the second and third also, so maybe the secret word has no duplicates. But we don\'t know.\n\nBut to maximize the chance, we can try SONIC.\n\nAnother idea: we know that the first letter cannot be a vowel? Not necessarily, but let\'s see.\n\nVowels we have: O and I are already in the word. We don\'t have A, E, U (absent). So the first letter must be a consonant? Not necessarily, because Y might be possible, but we haven\'t tested Y.\n\nBut in the common words, SONIC, IONIC, MONIC, the first letter of SONIC and MONIC are consonants, IONIC is vowel.\n\nBut we can try SONIC.\n\nWe also have to consider that we have only 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess.\n\nBut let\'s list the possibilities:\n\n- If we guess SONIC and it\'s correct, we win.\n- If not, then we know S is absent, and then we can try IONIC or MONIC.\n\nBut if we guess IONIC and it\'s wrong, we lose a guess.\n\nSimilarly for MONIC.\n\nBut note: if we guess a word that has a new letter, we get more information.\n\nBut in this case, since we know four letters, we can try to guess the word directly.\n\nThe most common words are SONIC and IONIC.\n\nBut IONIC has two I\'s, which might be less common.\n\nSo I think SONIC is a better guess.\n\nWe can also consider that in the feedback, we have no indication of duplicate letters, so the secret word might have all distinct letters. In that case, IONIC would be invalid because of two I\'s.\n\nTherefore, SONIC and MONIC are better.\n\nBetween SONIC and MONIC, SONIC is more common.\n\nSo we\'ll go with SONIC.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: SONIC: S-O-N-I-C\n\nPosition1: S (new, not absent)\nPosition2: O (correct)\nPosition3: N (correct)\nPosition4: I (correct)\nPosition5: C (correct)\n\nAnd it avoids absent letters.\n\nSo if the secret word is SONIC, we win.\n\nIf not, then S is absent, and we can try MONIC next.\n\nBut there might be other words like CONIC, but we know CONIC is invalid because of C in position1.\n\nTONIC is invalid because T is absent.\n\nWhat about ""BONIC""? Not common, but if we must, but let\'s stick to common words.\n\nAnother word: ""ZONIC"" is not common.\n\nSo I think SONIC is the best guess.\n\nTherefore, we guess SONIC.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:\n   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: \n     - C is present but not in position 1 (C(-)).\n     - R, A, E are absent (R(x), A(x), E(x)).\n     - N is present but not in position 4 (N(-)).\n   - **Guess 2 (LUNCH)**:\n     - L, U, H are absent (L(x), U(x), H(x)).\n     - N is correct and in position 3 (N(✓)).\n     - C is present but not in position 4 (C(-)).\n   - **Guess 3 (TONIC)**:\n     - T is absent (T(x)).\n     - O is correct and in position 2 (O(✓)).\n     - N is correct and in position 3 (N(✓)).\n     - I is correct and in position 4 (I(✓)).\n     - C is correct and in position 5 (C(✓)).\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:\n     - Position 2: **O**\n     - Position 3: **N**\n     - Position 4: **I**\n     - Position 5: **C**\n   - **Absent Letters**: R, A, E, L, U, H, T (cannot appear in the word).\n   - **Word Structure**: The secret word must be of the form `_ O N I C` (only position 1 is unknown).\n   - **Constraints for Position 1**:\n     - Must form a valid English word with ""ONIC"".\n     - Cannot be any absent letter (R, A, E, L, U, H, T).\n     - Should be a common consonant or vowel not yet tested (e.g., S, M, B, P, G, Y).\n\n3. **Generate Possible Words**:\n   - Common 5-letter words ending in ""ONIC"":\n     - **SONIC**: Starts with S (untested, common).\n     - **IONIC**: Starts with I (but I is already in position 4; possible duplicate, but less likely).\n     - **MONIC**: Starts with M (untested, less common than SONIC).\n     - **Other options** (e.g., CONIC, BONIC) are invalid:\n       - CONIC has C in position 1 (forbidden by Guess 1 feedback: C(-)).\n       - BONIC is uncommon/not standard.\n\n4. **Select the Best Guess**:\n   - **SONIC** is optimal because:\n     - It tests the most common valid word (`S O N I C`).\n     - Uses S (a high-frequency consonant) for position 1.\n     - Avoids duplicates (unlike IONIC, which repeats I).\n     - If correct, we solve the puzzle.

We are given feedback from the fourth guess: SONIC -> S(x) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓)

Interpretation:
- S is not in the word (x)
- O is in the correct position (position 2) (✓)
- N is in the correct position (position 3) (✓)
- I is in the correct position (position 4) (✓)
- C is in the correct position (position 5) (✓)

So, the secret word is of the form: _ O N I C

We know that the first letter is not S (and also not any of the previously absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H, T).

From previous feedback, absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H, T, S.

We need to find a 5-letter word that ends with ""ONIC"", but the first letter is not one of the absent letters.

Possible words:
- We already considered SONIC, but S is absent, so not that.
- IONIC: I in position1 and I in position4? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven't had any feedback indicating duplicates, but it's possible.
- MONIC: M in position1.
- Other possibilities: CONIC (but C in position1 is forbidden, as per Guess1 feedback: C is not in position1), BONIC (not common), DONIC (not common), etc.

But let's list valid English words ending with ""ONIC"" that are 5 letters:

Common ones:
- IONIC
- MONIC
- CONIC (invalid because of C in position1)
- TONIC (T is absent)
- BONIC? (not standard, but ""bionic"" is 6 letters)
- PONIC? (not common)
- YONIC (rare, but exists)

So the main candidates are IONIC and MONIC.

We must choose between these.

We know:
- In IONIC, the first letter is I, and we already have I in position4. So if the word has two I's, that's possible, but we don't have evidence for or against duplicates.

However, in all our previous guesses, we haven't had duplicate letters, and the feedback didn't show any duplicate, but that doesn't mean the secret word can't have duplicates.

But to be safe, we can try MONIC first, because it uses a new letter M.

If we guess MONIC and it's wrong, then we know M is absent, and then we can try IONIC.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are on the fifth guess. So we have two guesses left.

Alternatively, we can consider that IONIC is a very common word, so it might be that.

But let's see the pattern.

We have the word _ O N I C.

We know the absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H, T, S.

So the first letter must be a letter not in that set and not C (because C is in position5 and we don't know about duplicates, but in the first guess, C was present and not in position1, and in TONIC and SONIC, C was in position5 and correct, so if there were two C's, we might have seen an indication? But we don't have feedback about multiple C's. However, in the first guess, we had only one C and it was marked present, but that doesn't rule out two C's. Similarly, in the second guess, we had C in position4 and it was marked as not in position4, but present. Then in TONIC and SONIC, C in position5 is correct. So if the word has two C's, we would have had an extra C in the first guess? But in CRANE, we had C in position1 and it was marked as present but wrong position, but if there were two C's, we wouldn't know. However, in the feedback for CRANE, only one C was marked present, but that doesn't necessarily mean there is only one C because the feedback only marks the first occurrence? Actually, no, Wordle feedback marks each letter independently.

In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will mark each occurrence. For example, if the word is ""CIVIC"" and you guess ""CRANE"", then the first C would be marked as present (but wrong position) and the second C in the guess? But in CRANE there is only one C. So for a guess with duplicate letters, it gets tricky, but in our case, we haven't used duplicate letters in guesses.

But for the secret word, it might have duplicate letters.

However, in the feedback for TONIC and SONIC, we have C in position5 marked correct, and no other C's in the guess, so we don't know about other C's in the secret word.

Similarly, for I, in TONIC and SONIC, we have I in position4 marked correct, but no other I's.

So the secret word could have duplicate letters.

But to avoid risk, since we have two guesses left, we can try MONIC first.

If MONIC is wrong, then we try IONIC.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What about ""CONIC""? We know C cannot be in position1 because of the first guess feedback. In CRANE, we had C in position1 and it was marked as present but not in position1. So if the secret word had C in position1, that would be a contradiction. Therefore, CONIC is impossible.

Similarly, TONIC is impossible because T is absent.

So only IONIC and MONIC are left.

We can also consider ""YONIC"", but it's less common.

But let's go with MONIC as the next guess to test the letter M.

If we guess MONIC and it's correct, we win. If not, then we know M is absent, and then we can guess IONIC.

So we'll guess MONIC.

But note: MONIC is a valid word (meaning: relating to a monic polynomial, or in other contexts).

Alternatively, we could guess IONIC directly, but if it's wrong, we have one more guess for MONIC.

But since we have two guesses left, we can afford to test.

But to be efficient, we might as well guess IONIC because it's more common, but let's see the frequency.

In common usage, both are acceptable, but IONIC is more frequent.

But we don't know the word list.

However, to minimize risk, we can guess IONIC now because if it's correct, we win in five guesses. If not, then we know it must be MONIC (or YONIC, but we'll try MONIC next).

But if we guess IONIC and it's wrong, then we know that the first letter is not I? But wait, if we guess IONIC and the secret word is MONIC, then the feedback for IONIC would be:

Position1: I (if the secret word has M, then I is absent? But we don't know. The secret word is MONIC, so position1 is M, not I. So I in position1 would be marked absent? But we already have I in position4, so the feedback might mark the I in position4 as correct, and the I in position1 as absent? But we don't know.

Actually, in IONIC, the letters are: I, O, N, I, C.

But O, N, I (position4), C are correct. The first I is in position1, which is not the same as position4. So if the secret word is MONIC, then:

- Position1: I vs M -> not match, and I is not in the word? But wait, the secret word MONIC has no I? No, MONIC has I in position4. So I is present, but in position4, not position1.

So for IONIC:
- Position1: I -> should be marked as present but wrong position? Or absent? 

In Wordle rules, if a letter is in the word but in a different position, and if there is only one occurrence in the secret word, then if the guess has two of that letter, one might be marked correctly and the other as absent if the secret word has only one.

But in this case, for IONIC guess and MONIC secret:

- Position1: I -> the secret word has I, but only in position4. Since we have I in position1 and position4, but the secret word has only one I (in position4), then:
  - The I in position4 is correct (green).
  - The I in position1: since the secret word has only one I and it's already used in position4, then the I in position1 would be marked absent (black).

So feedback would be: I(x) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓) for the second I? But we have two I's in the guess.

Actually, the feedback for IONIC if secret is MONIC:
- Position1: I -> not in secret? But secret has I in position4, so I is present. But because we have two I's in the guess, and only one in the secret, the first I (position1) is marked as absent (because the I is already accounted for in position4), and the second I (position4) is correct.

So: I(x) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓)

But that would be confusing because we have I(✓) for position4 and I(x) for position1.

Similarly, if we guess IONIC and the secret is IONIC, then all are correct.

But if we guess IONIC and get feedback that position1 I is absent, then we know the word must be MONIC (or another, but we have only MONIC left).

But we have YONIC as a possibility, but rare.

So if we guess IONIC and it's not correct, then we know the first letter is not I, and we can guess MONIC.

But we have only one guess after that.

Alternatively, if we guess MONIC first and it's wrong, then we guess IONIC.

Either way, we have two possibilities and two guesses.

But to save a guess if IONIC is correct, we can guess IONIC now.

But if IONIC is wrong, we still have one guess for MONIC.

Similarly, if we guess MONIC and it's wrong, we have one guess for IONIC.

But if we guess IONIC and it's correct, we win in five.

If we guess MONIC and it's correct, we win in five.

But if we guess MONIC and it's wrong, we have to use the sixth guess for IONIC.

Similarly, if we guess IONIC and it's wrong, we use the sixth for MONIC.

But there's a small risk: what if the word is YONIC? Then both IONIC and MONIC would be wrong.

But YONIC is a valid word (relating to the yoni), so we should consider it.

But it's less common.

Given the common word lists, IONIC and MONIC are more likely.

But to be safe, we should consider YONIC.

But we have only two guesses.

We can try to guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we know the last four letters are fixed: O,N,I,C.

So the only thing that changes is the first letter.

We cannot test multiple first letters at once.

So we have to guess one by one.

We can try the most common one: IONIC.

Then if wrong, try MONIC, and if that's wrong, then YONIC? But we have only one more guess after this.

We are on the fifth guess, so we have two guesses left: guess 5 and guess 6.

So we can try IONIC for guess 5.

If it's correct, done.

If not, then for guess 6, we try MONIC.

If MONIC is wrong, then it must be YONIC or another rare word, but we don't have more guesses.

But let's list all possible 5-letter words ending with ""ONIC"" that are in the Wordle word list.

Common ones: IONIC, MONIC, CONIC (invalid), TONIC (invalid), SONIC (invalid), BONIC? (not in standard lists), CONIC is invalid, so only IONIC and MONIC are common.

YONIC might be in some word lists.

But to maximize the chance, we can try IONIC first because it's more frequent.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has many new letters? But we don't need to, because we know the last four letters are fixed.

So we have to guess the first letter.

We can try to use a word that is not of the form ?ONIC but that tests the first letter? But that would be inefficient because we know the last four are fixed.

For example, if we guess a word like ""MAGIC"", but we know the last four must be O,N,I,C, so if we guess ""MAGIC"", it would be M A G I C, which doesn't match the known positions.

So that would be wasteful.

We must guess a word that has O in position2, N in position3, I in position4, C in position5, and a new letter in position1.

So we have to choose between I, M, Y, etc.

I think the best is to try IONIC.

So we'll go with that.

But let's see the feedback from SONIC: S(x) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓)

So the secret word is _ O N I C, and we know S is absent.

So guess: IONIC

If it's correct, we win. If not, then we know I is not the first letter, and we try MONIC next.

But note: if we guess IONIC and the secret is MONIC, then as above, we get I(x) for position1, and the rest correct.

Then we know to try MONIC.

Similarly, if we get all correct, we win.

So we'll do that.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
     - C is present but not in position 1 (C(-)).
     - R, A, E are absent (R(x), A(x), E(x)).
     - N is present but not in position 4 (N(-)).
   - **Guess 2 (LUNCH)**:
     - L, U, H are absent (L(x), U(x), H(x)).
     - N is correct and in position 3 (N(✓)).
     - C is present but not in position 4 (C(-)).
   - **Guess 3 (TONIC)**:
     - T is absent (T(x)).
     - O is correct and in position 2 (O(✓)).
     - N is correct and in position 3 (N(✓)).
     - I is correct and in position 4 (I(✓)).
     - C is correct and in position 5 (C(✓)).
   - **Guess 4 (SONIC)**:
     - S is absent (S(x)).
     - O, N, I, C are correct and in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (O(✓), N(✓), I(✓), C(✓)).

2. **Key Insights**:
   - **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
     - Position 2: **O**
     - Position 3: **N**
     - Position 4: **I**
     - Position 5: **C**
   - **Absent Letters**: R, A, E, L, U, H, T, S (cannot appear in the word).
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word must be of the form `_ O N I C` (only position 1 is unknown).
   - **Constraints for Position 1**:
     - Must form a valid English word with ""ONIC"".
     - Cannot be any absent letter (R, A, E, L, U, H, T, S).
     - Possible candidates (based on common English words):
       - **IONIC**: Starts with I (I is already in position 4; possible but may involve a duplicate letter).
       - **MONIC**: Starts with M (less common, but valid; e.g., relating to a monic polynomial).
       - **YONIC**: Starts with Y (rare, but valid; e.g., relating to the yoni).
     - **CONIC** is invalid (C in position 1 is forbidden by Guess 1 feedback: C(-)).
     - **TONIC** and **SONIC** are invalid (T and S are absent).

3. **Select the Next Guess**:
   - **IONIC** is the most common and highest-frequency word fitting the pattern (e.g., meaning ""relating to ions"").
   - Testing **IONIC** first is efficient:
     - If correct, the puzzle is solved.
     - If incorrect, feedback will confirm if I is present/absent in position 1, narrowing options to **MONIC** or **YONIC** for the final guess.
   - Avoids wasting a guess on rarer words like **YONIC** prematurely.
   - Ensures we use the remaining guesses (5 and 6) optimally, as we have only two possibilities left after this guess.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - Guess **IONIC** to test the most likely candidate for position 1 while leveraging known positions and absent letters.

<guess>IONIC</guess>",IONIC,"We are given feedback from the fourth guess: SONIC -> S(x) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓)

Interpretation:
- S is not in the word (x)
- O is in the correct position (position 2) (✓)
- N is in the correct position (position 3) (✓)
- I is in the correct position (position 4) (✓)
- C is in the correct position (position 5) (✓)

So, the secret word is of the form: _ O N I C

We know that the first letter is not S (and also not any of the previously absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H, T).

From previous feedback, absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H, T, S.

We need to find a 5-letter word that ends with ""ONIC"", but the first letter is not one of the absent letters.

- IONIC: I in position1 and I in position4? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven't had any feedback indicating duplicates, but it's possible.
- MONIC: M in position1.
- Other possibilities: CONIC (but C in position1 is forbidden, as per Guess1 feedback: C is not in position1), BONIC (not common), DONIC (not common), etc.

But let's list valid English words ending with ""ONIC"" that are 5 letters:

Common ones:

- MONIC
- CONIC (invalid because of C in position1)
- TONIC (T is absent)

But let's see the pattern.

We have the word _ O N I C.

We know the absent letters: R, A, E, L, U, H, T, S.

So the first letter must be a letter not in that set and not C (because C is in position5 and we don't know about duplicates, but in the first guess, C was present and not in position1, and in TONIC and SONIC, C was in position5 and correct, so if there were two C's, we might have seen an indication?

So the secret word could have duplicate letters.

But to avoid risk, since we have two guesses left, we can try MONIC first.

If MONIC is wrong, then we try IONIC.

So feedback would be: I(x) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓) for the second I? But we have two I's in the guess.

Actually, the feedback for IONIC if secret is MONIC:
- Position1: I -> not in secret? But secret has I in position4, so I is present. But because we have two I's in the guess, and only one in the secret, the first I (position1) is marked as absent (because the I is already accounted for in position4), and the second I (position4) is correct.

So: I(x) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓)

But that would be confusing because we have I(✓) for position4 and I(x) for position1.

Similarly, if we guess IONIC and the secret is IONIC, then all are correct.

But if we guess IONIC and get feedback that position1 I is absent, then we know the word must be MONIC (or another, but we have only MONIC left).

But we have YONIC as a possibility, but rare.

So if we guess IONIC and it's not correct, then we know the first letter is not I, and we can guess MONIC.

But we have only one guess after that.

Alternatively, if we guess MONIC first and it's wrong, then we guess IONIC.

Either way, we have two possibilities and two guesses.

But to save a guess if IONIC is correct, we can guess IONIC now.

But if IONIC is wrong, we still have one guess for MONIC.

Similarly, if we guess MONIC and it's wrong, we have one guess for IONIC.

But if we guess IONIC and it's correct, we win in five.

If we guess MONIC and it's correct, we win in five.

But if we guess MONIC and it's wrong, we have to use the sixth guess for IONIC.

Similarly, if we guess IONIC and it's wrong, we use the sixth for MONIC.

But there's a small risk: what if the word is YONIC? Then both IONIC and MONIC would be wrong.

But YONIC is a valid word (relating to the yoni), so we should consider it.

But it's less common.

Given the common word lists, IONIC and MONIC are more likely.

But to be safe, we should consider YONIC.

But we have only two guesses.

We can try to guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we know the last four letters are fixed: O,N,I,C.

So the only thing that changes is the first letter.

We cannot test multiple first letters at once.

So we have to guess one by one.

We can try the most common one: IONIC.

Then if wrong, try MONIC, and if that's wrong, then YONIC? But we have only one more guess after this.

We are on the fifth guess, so we have two guesses left: guess 5 and guess 6.

So we can try IONIC for guess 5.

If it's correct, done.

If not, then for guess 6, we try MONIC.

If MONIC is wrong, then it must be YONIC or another rare word, but we don't have more guesses.

But let's list all possible 5-letter words ending with ""ONIC"" that are in the Wordle word list.

Common ones: IONIC, MONIC, CONIC (invalid), TONIC (invalid), SONIC (invalid), BONIC? (not in standard lists), CONIC is invalid, so only IONIC and MONIC are common.

YONIC might be in some word lists.

But to maximize the chance, we can try IONIC first because it's more frequent.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has many new letters? But we don't need to, because we know the last four letters are fixed.

So we have to guess the first letter.

We can try to use a word that is not of the form ?ONIC but that tests the first letter? But that would be inefficient because we know the last four are fixed.

For example, if we guess a word like ""MAGIC"", but we know the last four must be O,N,I,C, so if we guess ""MAGIC"", it would be M A G I C, which doesn't match the known positions.

So that would be wasteful.

We must guess a word that has O in position2, N in position3, I in position4, C in position5, and a new letter in position1.

So we have to choose between I, M, Y, etc.

I think the best is to try IONIC.

So we'll go with that.

But let's see the feedback from SONIC: S(x) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓)

So the secret word is _ O N I C, and we know S is absent.

So guess: IONIC

If it's correct, we win. If not, then we know I is not the first letter, and we try MONIC next.

But note: if we guess IONIC and the secret is MONIC, then as above, we get I(x) for position1, and the rest correct.

Then we know to try MONIC.

Similarly, if we get all correct, we win.

So we'll do that.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
     - C is present but not in position 1 (C(-)).
     - R, A, E are absent (R(x), A(x), E(x)).
     - N is present but not in position 4 (N(-)).
   - **Guess 2 (LUNCH)**:
     - L, U, H are absent (L(x), U(x), H(x)).
     - N is correct and in position 3 (N(✓)).
     - C is present but not in position 4 (C(-)).
   - **Guess 3 (TONIC)**:
     - T is absent (T(x)).
     - O is correct and in position 2 (O(✓)).
     - N is correct and in position 3 (N(✓)).
     - I is correct and in position 4 (I(✓)).
     - C is correct and in position 5 (C(✓)).
   - **Guess 4 (SONIC)**:
     - S is absent (S(x)).
     - O, N, I, C are correct and in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (O(✓), N(✓), I(✓), C(✓)).

2. **Key Insights**:
   - **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
     - Position 2: **O**
     - Position 3: **N**
     - Position 4: **I**
     - Position 5: **C**
   - **Absent Letters**: R, A, E, L, U, H, T, S (cannot appear in the word).
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word must be of the form `_ O N I C` (only position 1 is unknown).
   - **Constraints for Position 1**:
     - Must form a valid English word with ""ONIC"".
     - Cannot be any absent letter (R, A, E, L, U, H, T, S).
     - Possible candidates (based on common English words):
       - **IONIC**: Starts with I (I is already in position 4; possible but may involve a duplicate letter).
       - **MONIC**: Starts with M (less common, but valid; e.g., relating to a monic polynomial).
       - **YONIC**: Starts with Y (rare, but valid; e.g., relating to the yoni).
     - **CONIC** is invalid (C in position 1 is forbidden by Guess 1 feedback: C(-)).
     - **TONIC** and **SONIC** are invalid (T and S are absent).

3. **Select the Next Guess**:
   - **IONIC** is the most common and highest-frequency word fitting the pattern (e.g., meaning ""relating to ions"").
   - Testing **IONIC** first is efficient:
     - If correct, the puzzle is solved.
     - If incorrect, feedback will confirm if I is present/absent in position 1, narrowing options to **MONIC** or **YONIC** for the final guess.
   - Avoids wasting a guess on rarer words like **YONIC** prematurely.
   - Ensures we use the remaining guesses (5 and 6) optimally, as we have only two possibilities left after this guess.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - Guess **IONIC** to test the most likely candidate for position 1 while leveraging known positions and absent letters.",Guess 5: IONIC -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓),SUCCESS
