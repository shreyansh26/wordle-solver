We are starting the game. We need to make a first guess. Since we have no prior information, we choose a word that has common letters and a balanced letter distribution to maximize information.

Common vowels in English: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

A good starting word is often one that includes several common letters and has no repeated letters for maximum coverage.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Let me choose ""SLATE"" because it has common letters:

S, L, A, T, E

But note: the game's example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we have flexibility.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also very common.

I will go with ""CRANE"":

C, R, A, N, E

This gives us two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N), covering some of the most common letters.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

However, note that the feedback will tell us about the presence and positions of these letters.

Let me think: are there any reasons to choose a different word? 
We have 6 tries, and we want to eliminate as many possibilities as possible.

Another good word is ""ROAST"" but it has two 'S's? Wait, no: R, O, A, S, T.

But ""CRANE"" is a solid choice.

I decide ""CRANE"".

<guess> crane </guess>
</think>
I am making my first guess without any prior information. I need to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. Common strategy is to use a word with frequent letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. 

The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
- It contains common letters: C, R, A, N, E
- It has three consonants and two vowels (balanced distribution)
- All letters are unique, covering five distinct letters
- E and A are among the most frequent vowels, R and N are common consonants

This guess will provide feedback on the presence and position of these letters, helping narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position (since we guessed it there and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes the letter A (since it's present) but not in the 3rd position.
- Excludes the letters C, R, N, E (since they are absent).
- Is a valid English word.

We also want to maximize information by testing new common letters and positions.

Since A is in the word but not in position 3, it could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We should try to place A in a different position and include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should avoid using any of the discarded letters: C, R, N, E.

Let's think of words that have A in them (but not in the 3rd position) and use other common letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

We might want to test A in position 1 or 2 to see if it's there, or in 4 or 5.

Also, we can try to cover more vowels and consonants.

Since we have only one known letter (A) and we know it's not in position 3, we can try a word that has A in position 1, for example.

But we don't know if it's in position 1, so we might get more information by putting it in a position we haven't tested.

We tested A in position 3 and it was wrong. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's list some candidate words:

- Starting with A: words like APPLE, but E is discarded, so not allowed. Also, we cannot use E.

- Words with A in position 2: like SALAD, but S is a good letter to test. However, SALAD has two A's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the feedback doesn't indicate that. But we should avoid using A twice if we can, to test more letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

Let's try to form a word with A and four new letters.

For example, with S and T: we can try ""STAIR"" but R is discarded. R is not allowed.

We must avoid R.

Another idea: ""SALTY"" - let's check:
- S: new
- A: we know is in the word, and we put it in position 2 (which we haven't tested before)
- L: new
- T: new
- Y: new

But we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, SALTY is valid.

Alternatively, ""PASTA"" but P and S are new, but A is in position 2 and 5? We don't know if the word has two A's. But we only know one A is present. It might have more, but we don't know. However, to maximize information, we might avoid repeating letters.

Another option: ""PLAIT"" but I is new, but T is common. However, we have to avoid E, which we are.

But let's see: PLAIT has A in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A because we know it's not there? No, the feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3, so we can put it in other positions. But in PLAIT, A is in position 3? P-L-A-I-T, so A is in position 3. But we know that position 3 is not correct for A, so we should avoid putting A in position 3 again because we already know it's not there. We want to test a new position.

So, for the next guess, we should put A in a position we haven't tried: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

In SALTY, A is in position 2, which is new.

Another word: ""TAPAS"" but has two A's and S, but TAPAS is valid? It might be, but let's think of more common words.

""DAILY"" - D, A, I, L, Y. A is in position 2. But D, I, L, Y are new.

But we don't know if D, I, L, Y are in the word.

Another word: ""OASIS"" but O and S, but has S twice? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, A is in position 2, which is good. But OASIS has two S's and we might not get as much information.

We want to test five distinct letters if possible.

So, back to SALTY: letters S, A, L, T, Y. All distinct, and A is in position 2.

We can also consider ""SAULT"" but that might be less common.

""HASTY"" - H, A, S, T, Y. H is a bit less common, but still valid.

But SALTY seems fine.

Another option: ""PAINT"" but N is discarded, so we cannot use N.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So, PAINT has N -> invalid because N is not in the word.

Similarly, ""LATTE"" has E and T twice? But E is discarded.

So, we need a word without C, R, N, E.

Let me think of words with A in position 1: 
- ALBUM: A, L, B, U, M. B and U are less common? But valid.
- ADULT: A, D, U, L, T. U is a vowel, but we haven't tested U. But D, U, L, T are new.

ADULT has A in position 1, which is a new position.

Similarly, position 4: we can try a word with A in the fourth position, like ""PIZZA"" but Z is not common and double Z, not ideal.

""ULTRA"" but R is discarded.

So, avoiding R.

Position 5: like ""MANGA"" but M, A, N, G, A. N is discarded and two A's.

Not good.

So, perhaps position 1 or 2 are better.

I think SALTY is a good candidate: 
- Tests S in position 1
- A in position 2 (new position)
- L in position 3
- T in position 4
- Y in position 5

All new letters, and we get to test five new letters and the position of A.

Another candidate: ""SHALT"" but less common.

Or ""FLAKY"" but F and K are less common.

SALTY is a common word.

We could try ""STOMP"" but no A? We must include A because we know it's in the word. Otherwise, we are not using the information that A is present.

Important: we know A is in the word, so we should include it in our next guess to get more information about its position.

So, the next guess must contain the letter A.

Therefore, we cannot guess a word without A.

So, SALTY is a good choice.

Another word: ""TASTY"" but has two T's and two A's? T-A-S-T-Y. So A in position 2, but T in 1 and 4, and A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. So we are testing T twice and A twice. Not ideal because we get less information.

SALTY has all distinct letters.

Similarly, ""PASTY"" but P, A, S, T, Y. A in position 2. But PASTY is a word (like a pastry). And it has distinct letters.

But SALTY is more common.

We can also consider ""AUDIO"" but A in position 1, and U, D, I, O. But no common consonants? And we are testing four vowels and one consonant? Not ideal for information.

We should test a mix of vowels and consonants.

SALTY has two vowels (A and Y? Y can be a vowel, but in this context, it's a consonant) and three consonants.

But it's fine.

Another word: ""SALSA"" but has two S's and two A's, and we are repeating.

So, I think SALTY is a good choice.

Therefore, I will guess ""SALTY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the 3rd position (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include the letter A (since it is confirmed to be in the secret word), but not in the 3rd position.
- It must exclude C, R, N, and E (since they are absent).
- To maximize information, I chose a word with all new letters and common consonants/vowels not yet tested. ""SALTY"" fits this:
  - S, L, T, and Y are new letters (not previously guessed).
  - A is placed in position 2 (a new position to test, since position 3 was incorrect).
  - It is a valid 5-letter English word with distinct letters for broader coverage.

<guess>salty</guess>",salty,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position (since we guessed it there and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes the letter A (since it's present) but not in the 3rd position.
- Excludes the letters C, R, N, E (since they are absent).
- Is a valid English word.

We also want to maximize information by testing new common letters and positions.

Since A is in the word but not in position 3, it could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We should try to place A in a different position and include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should avoid using any of the discarded letters: C, R, N, E.

Let's think of words that have A in them (but not in the 3rd position) and use other common letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

We might want to test A in position 1 or 2 to see if it's there, or in 4 or 5.

Also, we can try to cover more vowels and consonants.

Since we have only one known letter (A) and we know it's not in position 3, we can try a word that has A in position 1, for example.

But we don't know if it's in position 1, so we might get more information by putting it in a position we haven't tested.

We tested A in position 3 and it was wrong. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's list some candidate words:

- Starting with A: words like APPLE, but E is discarded, so not allowed. Also, we cannot use E.

- Words with A in position 2: like SALAD, but S is a good letter to test. However, SALAD has two A's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the feedback doesn't indicate that. But we should avoid using A twice if we can, to test more letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

Let's try to form a word with A and four new letters.

For example, with S and T: we can try ""STAIR"" but R is discarded. R is not allowed.

We must avoid R.

Another idea: ""SALTY"" - let's check:
- S: new
- A: we know is in the word, and we put it in position 2 (which we haven't tested before)
- L: new
- T: new
- Y: new

But we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, SALTY is valid.

Alternatively, ""PASTA"" but P and S are new, but A is in position 2 and 5? We don't know if the word has two A's. But we only know one A is present. It might have more, but we don't know. However, to maximize information, we might avoid repeating letters.

Another option: ""PLAIT"" but I is new, but T is common. However, we have to avoid E, which we are.

But let's see: PLAIT has A in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A because we know it's not there? No, the feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3, so we can put it in other positions. But in PLAIT, A is in position 3? P-L-A-I-T, so A is in position 3. But we know that position 3 is not correct for A, so we should avoid putting A in position 3 again because we already know it's not there. We want to test a new position.

So, for the next guess, we should put A in a position we haven't tried: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

In SALTY, A is in position 2, which is new.

Another word: ""TAPAS"" but has two A's and S, but TAPAS is valid? It might be, but let's think of more common words.

""DAILY"" - D, A, I, L, Y. A is in position 2. But D, I, L, Y are new.

But we don't know if D, I, L, Y are in the word.

Another word: ""OASIS"" but O and S, but has S twice? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, A is in position 2, which is good. But OASIS has two S's and we might not get as much information.

We want to test five distinct letters if possible.

So, back to SALTY: letters S, A, L, T, Y. All distinct, and A is in position 2.

We can also consider ""SAULT"" but that might be less common.

""HASTY"" - H, A, S, T, Y. H is a bit less common, but still valid.

But SALTY seems fine.

Another option: ""PAINT"" but N is discarded, so we cannot use N.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So, PAINT has N -> invalid because N is not in the word.

Similarly, ""LATTE"" has E and T twice? But E is discarded.

So, we need a word without C, R, N, E.

Let me think of words with A in position 1: 
- ALBUM: A, L, B, U, M. B and U are less common? But valid.
- ADULT: A, D, U, L, T. U is a vowel, but we haven't tested U. But D, U, L, T are new.

ADULT has A in position 1, which is a new position.

Similarly, position 4: we can try a word with A in the fourth position, like ""PIZZA"" but Z is not common and double Z, not ideal.

""ULTRA"" but R is discarded.

So, avoiding R.

Position 5: like ""MANGA"" but M, A, N, G, A. N is discarded and two A's.

Not good.

So, perhaps position 1 or 2 are better.

I think SALTY is a good candidate: 
- Tests S in position 1
- A in position 2 (new position)
- L in position 3
- T in position 4
- Y in position 5

All new letters, and we get to test five new letters and the position of A.

Another candidate: ""SHALT"" but less common.

Or ""FLAKY"" but F and K are less common.

SALTY is a common word.

We could try ""STOMP"" but no A? We must include A because we know it's in the word. Otherwise, we are not using the information that A is present.

Important: we know A is in the word, so we should include it in our next guess to get more information about its position.

So, the next guess must contain the letter A.

Therefore, we cannot guess a word without A.

So, SALTY is a good choice.

Another word: ""TASTY"" but has two T's and two A's? T-A-S-T-Y. So A in position 2, but T in 1 and 4, and A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. So we are testing T twice and A twice. Not ideal because we get less information.

SALTY has all distinct letters.

Similarly, ""PASTY"" but P, A, S, T, Y. A in position 2. But PASTY is a word (like a pastry). And it has distinct letters.

But SALTY is more common.

We can also consider ""AUDIO"" but A in position 1, and U, D, I, O. But no common consonants? And we are testing four vowels and one consonant? Not ideal for information.

We should test a mix of vowels and consonants.

SALTY has two vowels (A and Y? Y can be a vowel, but in this context, it's a consonant) and three consonants.

But it's fine.

Another word: ""SALSA"" but has two S's and two A's, and we are repeating.

So, I think SALTY is a good choice.

Therefore, I will guess ""SALTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the 3rd position (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include the letter A (since it is confirmed to be in the secret word), but not in the 3rd position.
- It must exclude C, R, N, and E (since they are absent).
- To maximize information, I chose a word with all new letters and common consonants/vowels not yet tested. ""SALTY"" fits this:
  - S, L, T, and Y are new letters (not previously guessed).
  - A is placed in position 2 (a new position to test, since position 3 was incorrect).
  - It is a valid 5-letter English word with distinct letters for broader coverage.",Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) T(x) Y(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make a first guess. Since we have no prior information, we choose a word that has common letters and a balanced letter distribution to maximize information.

Common vowels in English: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

A good starting word is often one that includes several common letters and has no repeated letters for maximum coverage.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Let me choose ""SLATE"" because it has common letters:

S, L, A, T, E

But note: the game's example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we have flexibility.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also very common.

I will go with ""CRANE"":

C, R, A, N, E

This gives us two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N), covering some of the most common letters.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

However, note that the feedback will tell us about the presence and positions of these letters.

Let me think: are there any reasons to choose a different word? 
We have 6 tries, and we want to eliminate as many possibilities as possible.

Another good word is ""ROAST"" but it has two 'S's? Wait, no: R, O, A, S, T.

But ""CRANE"" is a solid choice.

I decide ""CRANE"".

<guess> crane </guess>I am making my first guess without any prior information. I need to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. Common strategy is to use a word with frequent letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. 

The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
- It contains common letters: C, R, A, N, E
- It has three consonants and two vowels (balanced distribution)
- All letters are unique, covering five distinct letters
- E and A are among the most frequent vowels, R and N are common consonants

This guess will provide feedback on the presence and position of these letters, helping narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position (since we guessed it there and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes the letter A (since it's present) but not in the 3rd position.
- Excludes the letters C, R, N, E (since they are absent).
- Is a valid English word.

We also want to maximize information by testing new common letters and positions.

Since A is in the word but not in position 3, it could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We should try to place A in a different position and include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should avoid using any of the discarded letters: C, R, N, E.

Let's think of words that have A in them (but not in the 3rd position) and use other common letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.

We might want to test A in position 1 or 2 to see if it's there, or in 4 or 5.

Also, we can try to cover more vowels and consonants.

Since we have only one known letter (A) and we know it's not in position 3, we can try a word that has A in position 1, for example.

But we don't know if it's in position 1, so we might get more information by putting it in a position we haven't tested.

We tested A in position 3 and it was wrong. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's list some candidate words:

- Starting with A: words like APPLE, but E is discarded, so not allowed. Also, we cannot use E.

- Words with A in position 2: like SALAD, but S is a good letter to test. However, SALAD has two A's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the feedback doesn't indicate that. But we should avoid using A twice if we can, to test more letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

Let's try to form a word with A and four new letters.

For example, with S and T: we can try ""STAIR"" but R is discarded. R is not allowed.

We must avoid R.

Another idea: ""SALTY"" - let's check:
- S: new
- A: we know is in the word, and we put it in position 2 (which we haven't tested before)
- L: new
- T: new
- Y: new

But we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, SALTY is valid.

Alternatively, ""PASTA"" but P and S are new, but A is in position 2 and 5? We don't know if the word has two A's. But we only know one A is present. It might have more, but we don't know. However, to maximize information, we might avoid repeating letters.

Another option: ""PLAIT"" but I is new, but T is common. However, we have to avoid E, which we are.

But let's see: PLAIT has A in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A because we know it's not there? No, the feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3, so we can put it in other positions. But in PLAIT, A is in position 3? P-L-A-I-T, so A is in position 3. But we know that position 3 is not correct for A, so we should avoid putting A in position 3 again because we already know it's not there. We want to test a new position.

So, for the next guess, we should put A in a position we haven't tried: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

In SALTY, A is in position 2, which is new.

Another word: ""TAPAS"" but has two A's and S, but TAPAS is valid? It might be, but let's think of more common words.

""DAILY"" - D, A, I, L, Y. A is in position 2. But D, I, L, Y are new.

But we don't know if D, I, L, Y are in the word.

Another word: ""OASIS"" but O and S, but has S twice? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, A is in position 2, which is good. But OASIS has two S's and we might not get as much information.

We want to test five distinct letters if possible.

So, back to SALTY: letters S, A, L, T, Y. All distinct, and A is in position 2.

We can also consider ""SAULT"" but that might be less common.

""HASTY"" - H, A, S, T, Y. H is a bit less common, but still valid.

But SALTY seems fine.

Another option: ""PAINT"" but N is discarded, so we cannot use N.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So, PAINT has N -> invalid because N is not in the word.

Similarly, ""LATTE"" has E and T twice? But E is discarded.

So, we need a word without C, R, N, E.

Let me think of words with A in position 1: 
- ALBUM: A, L, B, U, M. B and U are less common? But valid.
- ADULT: A, D, U, L, T. U is a vowel, but we haven't tested U. But D, U, L, T are new.

ADULT has A in position 1, which is a new position.

Similarly, position 4: we can try a word with A in the fourth position, like ""PIZZA"" but Z is not common and double Z, not ideal.

""ULTRA"" but R is discarded.

So, avoiding R.

Position 5: like ""MANGA"" but M, A, N, G, A. N is discarded and two A's.

Not good.

So, perhaps position 1 or 2 are better.

I think SALTY is a good candidate: 
- Tests S in position 1
- A in position 2 (new position)
- L in position 3
- T in position 4
- Y in position 5

All new letters, and we get to test five new letters and the position of A.

Another candidate: ""SHALT"" but less common.

Or ""FLAKY"" but F and K are less common.

SALTY is a common word.

We could try ""STOMP"" but no A? We must include A because we know it's in the word. Otherwise, we are not using the information that A is present.

Important: we know A is in the word, so we should include it in our next guess to get more information about its position.

So, the next guess must contain the letter A.

Therefore, we cannot guess a word without A.

So, SALTY is a good choice.

Another word: ""TASTY"" but has two T's and two A's? T-A-S-T-Y. So A in position 2, but T in 1 and 4, and A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. So we are testing T twice and A twice. Not ideal because we get less information.

SALTY has all distinct letters.

Similarly, ""PASTY"" but P, A, S, T, Y. A in position 2. But PASTY is a word (like a pastry). And it has distinct letters.

But SALTY is more common.

We can also consider ""AUDIO"" but A in position 1, and U, D, I, O. But no common consonants? And we are testing four vowels and one consonant? Not ideal for information.

We should test a mix of vowels and consonants.

SALTY has two vowels (A and Y? Y can be a vowel, but in this context, it's a consonant) and three consonants.

But it's fine.

Another word: ""SALSA"" but has two S's and two A's, and we are repeating.

So, I think SALTY is a good choice.

Therefore, I will guess ""SALTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in the 3rd position (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include the letter A (since it is confirmed to be in the secret word), but not in the 3rd position.
- It must exclude C, R, N, and E (since they are absent).
- To maximize information, I chose a word with all new letters and common consonants/vowels not yet tested. ""SALTY"" fits this:
  - S, L, T, and Y are new letters (not previously guessed).
  - A is placed in position 2 (a new position to test, since position 3 was incorrect).
  - It is a valid 5-letter English word with distinct letters for broader coverage.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position; specifically, not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""salty""
- S: ✓ (correct letter in correct position, so S is the first letter of the secret word)
- A: ✓ (correct letter in correct position, so A is the second letter of the secret word)
- L: ✓ (correct letter in correct position, so L is the third letter of the secret word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word starts with ""S"", followed by ""A"", followed by ""L"". So the first three letters are ""SAL"".
- The letter T is not in the word, and Y is not in the word.
- Additionally, from the first guess, we know that C, R, N, E are not in the word.

So, the secret word is of the form ""SAL _ _"", and the last two letters are unknown but must not be T, Y, C, R, N, or E.

Also, we know that A is in the second position (which we now have confirmed as correct), and we also know from the first guess that A is not in the third position (but now we have it in the second, which is consistent).

Now, we need to find a word that starts with ""SAL"" and the last two letters are from the remaining alphabet excluding the known absent letters.

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, Y.

We also have to consider that the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

Common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z (but we should focus on common ones).

We need to guess the last two letters.

Possible words that start with ""SAL"":
- SALAD (but D is still possible, but note that we have two A's? However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But in our feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so it might be possible. However, in ""salty"", we had A in position 2 and no other A, so if the word had two A's, we might have gotten a hint? But in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but that doesn't rule out an A in another position. However, in the second guess, we have A in position 2 correct, and if there were another A, we might have gotten a '-' for it if it were in the word but wrong position? But in ""salty"", we only have one A, so we don't know. But let's not assume duplicates until we have evidence.)

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now in the second guess, we have A in position 2 and it's correct. So if the word had two A's, we would have seen an indication in the first guess for the other A? But in the first guess, we only had one A (in position 3) and it was marked as present. That doesn't tell us if there is another A. Similarly, in the second guess, we only have one A and it's correct. So we cannot rule out the possibility of duplicate letters.

However, for now, let's try to think of common words.

Common words starting with ""SAL"":
- SALAD (ends with AD)
- SALSA (but has S again, and we already have S at the start, but S might be duplicated? Also, A is duplicated. But note: we have S as the first letter, so if we guess SALSA, the second S would be in position 4 and the last letter A. But we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears again. However, we also have to consider that T, Y, C, R, N, E are absent, so SALSA might be a candidate? But let's see the feedback we would get: we have S in position 1 (correct), A in position 2 (correct), L in position 3 (correct), then S in position 4: if the word is SALSA, then S is also in position 4? But we already have S in position 1, so if the word has S only once, then the S in position 4 would be wrong. But if it has two S's, then it might be correct. We don't know. So it's risky to guess a word with duplicate letters at this point because we might not get much information.

Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates to test more letters.

But we have only two positions left (4 and 5) and we know the first three are SAL.

So we need to guess the last two letters.

We can try to think of words that start with SAL and have two new letters that we haven't tested.

We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T, Y. (A, S, L are in the word, but we are focusing on the absent ones: C, R, N, E, T, Y).

So available letters: all except C, R, N, E, T, Y, and the known present ones (S, A, L).

But S, A, L are already placed, so for positions 4 and 5, we need to choose from the remaining letters that are not absent.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

We want to choose a word that uses two of these and is common.

Common words:
- SALAD: D is available, but we have A again? SALAD has A in position 5. But we already know A is in the word (at position 2). If we use SALAD, we are testing A again. But if the word has only one A, then the A in position 5 would be marked as absent (x) or if it has two A's, it might be present but wrong position? But we don't know. However, we are trying to find the word, so we can try.

But let's list some:
- SALAD: positions 4 and 5: A and D. But A is already known, so we are only testing D. And if the word has only one A, then the A in position 5 would be incorrect. But we don't know the count.

- SALON: O and N. But N is absent (from first guess: N(x)), so we cannot use N. So SALON is invalid.

- SALSA: S and A. We already have S and A, so we are testing duplicates. Not ideal for information.

- SALTY: we already tried, and T and Y are absent.

- SALVO: V and O. Both available. And it's a word.

- SALMI: M and I. Both available.

- SALLY: L and Y. But Y is absent (from second guess: Y(x)), and also L is already in position 3, so if we have another L, it might be duplicate. But Y is absent, so SALLY is invalid.

- SALPA: P and A. Again, A again.

- SALEP: E and P. But E is absent (from first guess: E(x)), so invalid.

- SALUT: U and T. But T is absent (from second guess: T(x)), so invalid.

- SALOP: O and P. Both available.

- SALAD is a common word, but has A again.

We need to choose a word that uses two new letters to test.

Ideal: a word with two new letters that are common, so we can either confirm their presence or absence.

But note: we are forced to use the pattern ""SAL__"", so we are only testing the last two letters.

So, for example, if we guess ""SALVO"", we test V and O.

If we guess ""SALMI"", we test M and I.

If we guess ""SALOP"", that might be less common.

Another one: ""SALON"" is invalid because of N.

""SALVE"": but E is absent.

""SALTY"" already tried.

""SALSA"" has duplicates.

What about ""SALET""? But E and T are absent.

Not many options.

Another word: ""SALAD"" is very common. Even though it has A, we can still use it. If the A in position 5 is present, then we know there is a duplicate A. If not, then we know there is only one A.

Similarly, we test D.

But we have only 6 tries, so we might want to be efficient.

We can also consider ""SALPA"" but it's rare.

I think ""SALAD"" is a good candidate because it's common and we test D.

But let's see if there is a word without duplicates.

""SALOL"": O and L. But L is already in position 3, so duplicate L. And it's not very common.

""SALMO"": M and O. But SALMO might be a genus or something, not a common word.

""SALUD"": U and D. But U and D are available. But ""SALUD"" is Spanish, might not be accepted? We need an English word.

In Wordle, the word list is English words, so we should stick to common English words.

""SALAD"" is English and common.

""SALON"" is English but has N which is absent.

""SALEP"" not common and has E.

""SALMI"" is a word (a stew), so it might be acceptable.

Similarly, ""SALOL"" is a chemical, not common.

Another one: ""SALPS"" but S again and P, but ""SALPS"" is plural and might not be in the word list? Also, ends with S, which we haven't tested, but we have S at the start.

But let's focus.

We can try ""SALAD"" or ""SALMI"".

But note: we have only two positions, and we are going to get feedback on both letters.

If we guess ""SALAD"":
- Position 1: S (correct, we know)
- Position 2: A (correct, we know)
- Position 3: L (correct, we know)
- Position 4: A -> if the secret word has an A in position 4, it would be marked as present but wrong position? But we have A already in position 2. If the word has two A's, then position 4 A might be marked as:
  - If the secret word has A in position 4, then we get a '-' (wrong position) or if it's the same as position 2, it might be marked as present if there is a duplicate? The feedback should indicate: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets '-', and if it's in the correct position, it gets '✓'. For duplicates: if the secret word has two A's, and we guess two A's, then one might be correct and the other might be in wrong position or absent? Actually, the feedback is per letter. So if the secret word has one A, and we guess two A's, then one A (the one in the correct position) gets ✓, and the other A (in wrong position) would get x (because there's no second A). If the secret word has two A's, then the A in the correct position gets ✓, and the other A might get '-' if it's in the word but wrong position, or if it's in the correct position for the second A? But in this case, for ""SALAD"", if the secret word is ""SALAD"", then position 4 A is correct? No, in ""SALAD"", the A is in position 2 and 4? S-A-L-A-D, so position 2 is A, position 4 is A. So if we guess ""SALAD"" and the secret word is ""SALAD"", then:
  - Position 1: S ✓
  - Position 2: A ✓
  - Position 3: L ✓
  - Position 4: A ✓ (because it's the same as position 2? But in the secret word, there is an A at position 4, so it should be ✓ if we guess it there.
But if the secret word has only one A (at position 2), then position 4 A would be x.

Similarly, position 5: D, which we don't know.

So, by guessing ""SALAD"", we can determine if there is an A at position 4 and also test D.

But we are also using a letter we already know (A) again, so we are not testing a new letter in position 4.

To maximize new information, we might prefer a word with two new letters.

So, let's list possible words without using known absent letters and without reusing A (if possible) in the last two positions.

Words starting with SAL:
- SALMI: M and I (both new)
- SALOP: O and P (both new) - but ""salop"" is a historical term for a drink or something, might not be common.
- SALVO: V and O (both new) - a salvo is a simultaneous discharge of guns, or a burst, so it's a word.
- SALPA: P and A (A is not new) - and it's a genus, not common.
- SALUD: U and D (both new) - Spanish for health, but sometimes used in English, but might not be in the word list.
- SALAD: A and D (A not new, D new) - common.

""SALOL"" has L again, not good.

""SALMO"" has O, but M and O? SALMO is not common.

Another one: ""SALUT"" has T and U, but T is absent.

""SALTY"" already tried.

I think ""SALVO"" is a reasonable choice: it's an English word, and we test V and O.

Similarly, ""SALMI"" is acceptable.

But let's check the frequency: O is a common letter, V is less common. I is common.

Perhaps ""SALON"" is common, but N is absent.

We must avoid N.

Another word: ""SALEP"" invalid.

What about ""SALFS""? Not a word.

I think ""SALAD"" and ""SALVO"" are the top contenders.

But to test two new letters, I'll go with ""SALVO"".

So, guess: SALVO

If we get feedback:
- Position 4: V -> if correct, then ✓, else if present but wrong, then -, else x.
- Position 5: O -> similarly.

But note: we know the first three are correct, so we only care about the last two.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that might be the answer if it fits.

But we don't have enough information.

Since we have only two positions, and we have 4 guesses left, we can try to cover more common letters.

But with two positions, we can only test two letters at a time.

We can try a word that has common letters in the last two positions.

For example, O is a common letter, so ""SALVO"" tests O.

D is common, so ""SALAD"" tests D.

I is common, so ""SALMI"" tests I.

Let's choose ""SALVO"" because it tests two new letters and is a valid word.

But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters, but we'll see.

Another idea: we can try a word that doesn't start with SAL? But we know the first three are SAL, so we must start with SAL. Otherwise, we would be contradicting known information.

The secret word is ""SAL"" followed by two letters. So we must guess a word that starts with SAL.

Therefore, I will guess ""SALVO"".

But let me confirm: is ""SALVO"" in the word list? I believe it is.

So, <guess>salvo</guess>

But we have to output in the required format.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1 (""crane"") revealed that A is in the word but not in position 3, and C, R, N, E are absent.
- Guess 2 (""salty"") confirmed that S, A, L are in the correct positions (1, 2, and 3), so the word starts with ""SAL"". It also revealed that T and Y are absent.

The secret word is therefore ""SAL"" followed by two unknown letters. The absent letters are C, R, N, E, T, Y. The next guess must:
- Start with ""SAL"".
- Use only letters not yet ruled out (available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z).
- Prioritize common English words and test new letters to maximize information about the remaining positions.

After evaluating options:
- ""SALAD"" was considered but rejected because it reuses A (a known letter) in position 4, reducing new information.
- ""SALMI"" (a type of stew) tests M and I, but I is a vowel and less critical to test immediately.
- ""SALVO"" (meaning a simultaneous discharge of weapons) was chosen because:
  - It tests two new, moderately common consonants (V and O).
  - It avoids reused or absent letters.
  - It is a valid English word that fits the pattern.

This guess will provide clear feedback on whether V or O are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities efficiently.

<guess>salvo</guess>",salvo,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position; specifically, not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""salty""
- S: ✓ (correct letter in correct position, so S is the first letter of the secret word)
- A: ✓ (correct letter in correct position, so A is the second letter of the secret word)
- L: ✓ (correct letter in correct position, so L is the third letter of the secret word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word starts with ""S"", followed by ""A"", followed by ""L"". So the first three letters are ""SAL"".
- The letter T is not in the word, and Y is not in the word.
- Additionally, from the first guess, we know that C, R, N, E are not in the word.

So, the secret word is of the form ""SAL _ _"", and the last two letters are unknown but must not be T, Y, C, R, N, or E.

Also, we know that A is in the second position (which we now have confirmed as correct), and we also know from the first guess that A is not in the third position (but now we have it in the second, which is consistent).

Now, we need to find a word that starts with ""SAL"" and the last two letters are from the remaining alphabet excluding the known absent letters.

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, Y.

We also have to consider that the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

Common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z (but we should focus on common ones).

We need to guess the last two letters.

Possible words that start with ""SAL"":
- SALAD (but D is still possible, but note that we have two A's? However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But in our feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so it might be possible. However, in ""salty"", we had A in position 2 and no other A, so if the word had two A's, we might have gotten a hint? But in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but that doesn't rule out an A in another position. However, in the second guess, we have A in position 2 correct, and if there were another A, we might have gotten a '-' for it if it were in the word but wrong position? But in ""salty"", we only have one A, so we don't know. But let's not assume duplicates until we have evidence.)

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now in the second guess, we have A in position 2 and it's correct. So if the word had two A's, we would have seen an indication in the first guess for the other A? But in the first guess, we only had one A (in position 3) and it was marked as present. That doesn't tell us if there is another A. Similarly, in the second guess, we only have one A and it's correct. So we cannot rule out the possibility of duplicate letters.

However, for now, let's try to think of common words.

Common words starting with ""SAL"":
- SALAD (ends with AD)
- SALSA (but has S again, and we already have S at the start, but S might be duplicated? Also, A is duplicated. But note: we have S as the first letter, so if we guess SALSA, the second S would be in position 4 and the last letter A. But we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears again. However, we also have to consider that T, Y, C, R, N, E are absent, so SALSA might be a candidate? But let's see the feedback we would get: we have S in position 1 (correct), A in position 2 (correct), L in position 3 (correct), then S in position 4: if the word is SALSA, then S is also in position 4? But we already have S in position 1, so if the word has S only once, then the S in position 4 would be wrong. But if it has two S's, then it might be correct. We don't know. So it's risky to guess a word with duplicate letters at this point because we might not get much information.
