We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"": all letters excluded (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word)
2. ""moist"": 
   - O is correct and in the correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is O)
   - S and T are in the word but in the wrong position? Wait, let's check the feedback:
   Feedback: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(✓)

Wait, the feedback says for ""moist"":
- M: x (not in word)
- O: ✓ (correct and in correct position, so position 2 is O)
- I: x (not in word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in correct position? But the symbol is ✓, which means ""in the word and in the correct position"")
- T: ✓ (same, should be in the word and in correct position)

But let me read the feedback: ""FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(✓)""

So:
- Position 1: M → x (not in word)
- Position 2: O → ✓ (correct)
- Position 3: I → x (not in word)
- Position 4: S → ✓ (correct, so S must be in position 4)
- Position 5: T → ✓ (correct, so T must be in position 5)

Therefore, the current known information:
- The secret word has the form: ? O ? S T
  Because:
    Second letter: O
    Fourth letter: S
    Fifth letter: T

So the word pattern is: _ O _ S T

Also, from Guess 1, we know that C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.

From Guess 2, M and I are not in the word.

So, excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

We need to guess a word that fits the pattern _ O _ S T.

Now, letters not excluded: We have 26 letters minus excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I.

Excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, I → that's 7 letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But the word must be a valid English word. The pattern is ? O ? S T.

We need to fill the first and third positions.

Possible words: We need to think of 5-letter words ending with ""S T"", with the second letter O, and not containing any of the excluded letters.

Looking at the pattern: _ O _ S T

The third letter must be one of the remaining letters, and so must the first letter.

Common words? For example, could it be ""BOOST""? But ""BOOST"" has O twice? Wait, pattern: B O O S T? But wait, pattern requires ? O ? S T.

""BOOST"" would be positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:O, 4:S, 5:T? That doesn't match the pattern because in ""moist"" the feedback showed positions 4 and 5 as correct for S and T.

But in ""BOOST"", the positions are:
  Position 2: O (matches)
  Position 4: S (matches)
  Position 5: T (matches)
But position 3: O? But in our pattern, the third letter is unknown.

But now, what about the first letter: in ""BOOST"" it's B.

The feedback: if we guess ""BOOST"", what happens? But we haven't guessed it yet.

Our pattern: _ O _ S T.

""BOOST"" has O in position 2, O in position 3? But position 3 is not specified yet.

In our case, we know position 2 is O, position 4 is S, position 5 is T, but position 1 and 3 are unknown.

Excluded letters must be avoided.

Now, possible words fitting _ O _ S T:

Let's think:

- ""BOAST"" → has A? A is excluded (from guess1). And also pattern letters: B O A S T. But S is in pos4? Yes, but A is excluded.

- ""HOSTS"" → but has two S? Pattern is _ O _ S T -> if it ends with ST, then it must have S only at position 4? ""HOSTS"" is H O S T S -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:S, 4:T, 5:S -> that doesn't match because position 4 should be S? No, in our pattern, position 4 is S and position 5 is T.

So we need words like: ? O ? S T

Examples:
- ""BOOST"": B O O S T → letters: B, O, O, S, T → O repeated? But the pattern does not forbid repeated letters, unless we have information. From feedback, we don't get repetition info automatically.

But let's see: in the secret word, is there a repeated letter? We don't know yet.

But in ""BOOST"", it would fit the pattern: positions 2,4,5 are fixed, and O in position 3.

Another word: ""JOIST"" → but J is possible? But in previous guesses, J wasn't excluded? However, ""joist"" has J, O, I, S, T → but I is excluded (from guess2). So I cannot be present.

Similarly, other words.

List possible:

Words ending in ""ST"" with pattern: * O * S T? Actually, the suffix must be ""S T"" with S at 4 and T at 5.

So words: [letter1] O [letter3] S T

With constraints: letter1 and letter3 must be from the remaining set: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And not using C,R,A,N,E,M,I.

Now, ""BOOST"": uses B and O → O is allowed? O is in the word but it's at position 2, and we are using O again? Like positions: B, O, O, S, T → that has two O's.

Is O repeated allowed? We don't know. We must consider it as possible.

But also, ""BOOST"" might be valid.

Another possibility: ""FOUST""? Is that a word? Not common.

""HOIST"" → but ""HOIST"" is H O I S T → I is excluded.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" → but N excluded.

""MOIST"" we already guessed.

Remember, we need letter3 to not be excluded.

Possible letter3: must not be in excluded (C,R,A,N,E,M,I), and not have been guessed? We can reuse possibilities as long as not excluded.

Other words:
- ""JOUST"": J O U S T → positions: J, O, U, S, T → which matches pattern: 1:J, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T → letters: J, O, U, S, T → U is not excluded? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I — U is not in excluded, so possible.

Similarly, ""DOUST"" — not common? Is it a word? Or ""DOUBT"" but that ends with T? ""DOUBT"" is D O U B T — positions: D, O, U, B, T — not ending with ST.

Another word: ""ROUST"" — but R is excluded? R is in excluded list from guess1.

R excluded, so no.

""BOUGH"" — doesn't end with ST.

We need ""S"" at position 4 and ""T"" at 5.

Another: ""GUSTO"" — but that starts with G U S T O, doesn't match.

What about ""OCCUR""? But pattern must have O at 2, S at 4, T at 5? Not.

We should focus on the pattern.

Possible words: 
- ""JOUST"": J O U S T
- ""YOUTH"" no, no S.
- ""TOUGH"" no.
- ""WOUST"" — not standard.
- ""COUST"" — not word, and C excluded.

Perhaps ""JOUST"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning joust, like knights.

Others?
- ""DOUSE"" but E excluded? And ends with E, not T.
- ""FOULS"" no T.

Another common one: ""LOUSE"" but E excluded? And pattern not match.

Another: ""POUTS"" — P O U T S? But position: P, O, U, T, S — that would be 4:T, 5:S, but we need position 4:S and 5:T — so S at 4, T at 5. This ends with S? S at 5, T at 4? No.

For ""POUTS"": positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:T, 5:S — doesn't match because we require position 4:S, but in this it's T, and position 5:S not T.

We specifically need position 4:S and 5:T.

So let's find words ending with S T? Like ...ST? But ""ST"" ending? Actually, few words end with ""S T"".

For example: ""BLAST"", but A excluded? Also positions: if ""BLAST"" , it's B L A S T — position 4:S? Position is 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T — but we need position 2:O? No, position 2 must be O.

So only the form: ? O ? S T

With ? being from allowed letters.

Other possibilities:
- ""JOUST"": J O U S T
- ""JOIST"" — J O I S T — but I is excluded, so not.
- ""TOAST"" — T O A S T — A excluded.
- ""BOOST"": B O O S T
- ""ROOST"" — R excluded.

""FOIST"" — F O I S T — I excluded.

""GHOST"" — G H O S T — positions: G, H, O, S, T — that's pos1:G, pos2:H? But we need pos2:O, which in ""GHOST"" is letter 3:O? No: G-H-O-S-T → position 1:G, 2:H, 3:O, 4:S, 5:T — so it doesn't have O at position 2; instead O at pos3.

Only words that have the letter ""O"" at the second position and end with ""ST""?

For instance, some words:
- ""BOOST""
- ""JOUST""
- ""DOUSE"" — but ends with E.
- ""GOUSE"" — archaic, not common.
- ""HOOSH"" — not.
- ""LOUSY"" — but Y and L? And positions: L O U S Y — not ST ending.

Another: ""POUTY"" — not.
""TOUSY"" — maybe, but not ST.

Perhaps ""BOOST"" or ""JOUST"" are the most common.

Also, ""TOHST"" — no.

How about ""YOWST""? Not standard.

So realistically, common words: ""BOOST"", ""JOUST""

But ""BOOST"" has double O? But that's possible.

Now, from feedback, we also have that S and T are at the correct positions, and O at position 2.

For ""JOUST"": letters J, O, U, S, T — all except O,S,T are J and U. J is rare? But possible.

Similarly, for ""BOOST"": B, O, O, S, T.

Now, excluded letters: B is not excluded? B is allowed.

Also, we know that M is excluded, but B is not.

From Guess2, we have the T and S at correct positions? Yes, in feedback for ""moist"", T and S were ✓ meaning correct position.

Therefore, the secret word must end with ST? Since position 4 and 5 are S and T.

Pattern: _ O _ S T

Now, possible guesses:

We have only a few possibilities left, but we have 4 more tries? Since we've used 2 guesses.

We can guess either ""BOOST"" or ""JOUST"" directly? Or we can choose a guess that covers more possibilities.

But there might be only these two, unless I miss some.

Another word: ""TOUSS"" — not a word.

""YUMMY"" — not.

Or ""ZOWIE"" — no.

So probably ""BOOST"" and ""JOUST"".

But ""JOUST"" uses U and J, which are less common.

""BOOST"" uses B and O repeated.

Is there another word? ""GROUT"" — but G R O U T — positions: G, R, O, U, T — that has R excluded? No, R is excluded. Also position not ST ending.

Perhaps ""FROSH"" - no.

Another: ""FOUST"" - obsolete term.

But let's consider: we can guess ""JOUST"" or ""BOOST"".

However, we also need to exclude letters? No, we want to solve.

Since the pattern is fixed, we could guess one of them.

But by guessing ""BOOST"", we can confirm.

Similarly, guessing ""JOUST"".

But we must avoid excluded letters? We have a short list.

To maximize information, if we guess ""BOOST"" and it's wrong, we learn something.

Alternatively, if there are more possibilities, we should check.

Another word: ""DOUGH"" — no S.

Or ""PLUSH"" — no.

In fact, English words with pattern _ O _ S T are very few.

We have ""JOUST"" and ""BOOST"".

Also, ""YOUST"" - not.

Or ""WOOSH"" - not.

So I think those are the only common ones.

Let's verify with a dictionary mentally.

- BOOST: valid
- JOUST: valid

Yes.

Now, if we guess ""BOOST"", what feedback would we get if the word is ""BOOST""? Then all correct.

If the word is ""JOUST"", then for ""BOOST"": first letter B might be x if not present, O✓ (position), O might be ? But we don't know about the third letter.

Similarly, if we guess ""JOUST"", and the word is ""BOOST"", then J and U might incorrect.

Since we have limited tries, perhaps guess ""BOOST"" as it has B which is not tested.

But we know B isn't excluded? No, we haven't tested B.

Similarly for U and J.

So let's go with ""BOOST"".

But remember, in ""BOOST"", the third letter is O, which was already present? But we don't know if O can be repeated.

But the feedback symbols will tell.

So I will guess ""BOOST"".

But let's format the response.
</think>
Based on the feedback:  
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): All letters C, R, A, N, E are excluded.  
- From Guess 2 (""moist""):  
  - O is correct and in position 2.  
  - S is correct and in position 4.  
  - T is correct and in position 5.  
  - M and I are excluded.  

The secret word must match the pattern: _ O _ S T (position 2: O, position 4: S, position 5: T). The excluded letters are C, R, A, N, E, M, I, so the unknown positions (1 and 3) must use letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Possible valid English words fitting the pattern include ""BOOST"" and ""JOUST"". ""BOOST"" (B O O S T) has distinct letters except for the double O, but repetitions are allowed unless excluded. ""JOUST"" (J O U S T) uses less common letters like J and U. Given that ""BOOST"" tests B (a high-frequency letter not yet tested) and quickly verifies the third position O, it is a strong candidate to guess. This guess will clarify if O is repeated and the status of B, potentially solving the puzzle or narrowing down further.  

Thus, the next guess is ""BOOST"".  

<guess>boost</guess>",boost,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"": all letters excluded (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word)
2. ""moist"": 
   - O is correct and in the correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is O)
   - S and T are in the word but in the wrong position? Wait, let's check the feedback:
   Feedback: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(✓)

Wait, the feedback says for ""moist"":
- M: x (not in word)
- O: ✓ (correct and in correct position, so position 2 is O)
- I: x (not in word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in correct position? But the symbol is ✓, which means ""in the word and in the correct position"")
- T: ✓ (same, should be in the word and in correct position)

But let me read the feedback: ""FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(✓)""

So:
- Position 1: M → x (not in word)
- Position 2: O → ✓ (correct)
- Position 3: I → x (not in word)
- Position 4: S → ✓ (correct, so S must be in position 4)
- Position 5: T → ✓ (correct, so T must be in position 5)

Therefore, the current known information:
- The secret word has the form: ? O ? S T
  Because:
    Second letter: O
    Fourth letter: S
    Fifth letter: T

So the word pattern is: _ O _ S T

Also, from Guess 1, we know that C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.

From Guess 2, M and I are not in the word.

So, excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

We need to guess a word that fits the pattern _ O _ S T.

Now, letters not excluded: We have 26 letters minus excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I.

Excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, I → that's 7 letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But the word must be a valid English word. The pattern is ? O ? S T.

We need to fill the first and third positions.

Possible words: We need to think of 5-letter words ending with ""S T"", with the second letter O, and not containing any of the excluded letters.

Looking at the pattern: _ O _ S T

The third letter must be one of the remaining letters, and so must the first letter.

Common words? For example, could it be ""BOOST""? But ""BOOST"" has O twice? Wait, pattern: B O O S T? But wait, pattern requires ? O ? S T.

""BOOST"" would be positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:O, 4:S, 5:T? That doesn't match the pattern because in ""moist"" the feedback showed positions 4 and 5 as correct for S and T.

But in ""BOOST"", the positions are:
  Position 2: O (matches)
  Position 4: S (matches)
  Position 5: T (matches)
But position 3: O? But in our pattern, the third letter is unknown.

But now, what about the first letter: in ""BOOST"" it's B.

The feedback: if we guess ""BOOST"", what happens? But we haven't guessed it yet.

Our pattern: _ O _ S T.

""BOOST"" has O in position 2, O in position 3? But position 3 is not specified yet.

In our case, we know position 2 is O, position 4 is S, position 5 is T, but position 1 and 3 are unknown.

Excluded letters must be avoided.

Now, possible words fitting _ O _ S T:

Let's think:

- ""BOAST"" → has A? A is excluded (from guess1). And also pattern letters: B O A S T. But S is in pos4? Yes, but A is excluded.

- ""HOSTS"" → but has two S? Pattern is _ O _ S T -> if it ends with ST, then it must have S only at position 4? ""HOSTS"" is H O S T S -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:S, 4:T, 5:S -> that doesn't match because position 4 should be S? No, in our pattern, position 4 is S and position 5 is T.

So we need words like: ? O ? S T

Examples:
- ""BOOST"": B O O S T → letters: B, O, O, S, T → O repeated? But the pattern does not forbid repeated letters, unless we have information. From feedback, we don't get repetition info automatically.

But let's see: in the secret word, is there a repeated letter? We don't know yet.

But in ""BOOST"", it would fit the pattern: positions 2,4,5 are fixed, and O in position 3.

Another word: ""JOIST"" → but J is possible? But in previous guesses, J wasn't excluded? However, ""joist"" has J, O, I, S, T → but I is excluded (from guess2). So I cannot be present.

Similarly, other words.

List possible:

Words ending in ""ST"" with pattern: * O * S T? Actually, the suffix must be ""S T"" with S at 4 and T at 5.

So words: [letter1] O [letter3] S T

With constraints: letter1 and letter3 must be from the remaining set: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And not using C,R,A,N,E,M,I.

Now, ""BOOST"": uses B and O → O is allowed? O is in the word but it's at position 2, and we are using O again? Like positions: B, O, O, S, T → that has two O's.

Is O repeated allowed? We don't know. We must consider it as possible.

But also, ""BOOST"" might be valid.

Another possibility: ""FOUST""? Is that a word? Not common.

""HOIST"" → but ""HOIST"" is H O I S T → I is excluded.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" → but N excluded.

""MOIST"" we already guessed.

Remember, we need letter3 to not be excluded.

Possible letter3: must not be in excluded (C,R,A,N,E,M,I), and not have been guessed? We can reuse possibilities as long as not excluded.

Other words:
- ""JOUST"": J O U S T → positions: J, O, U, S, T → which matches pattern: 1:J, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T → letters: J, O, U, S, T → U is not excluded? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I — U is not in excluded, so possible.

Similarly, ""DOUST"" — not common? Is it a word? Or ""DOUBT"" but that ends with T? ""DOUBT"" is D O U B T — positions: D, O, U, B, T — not ending with ST.

Another word: ""ROUST"" — but R is excluded? R is in excluded list from guess1.

R excluded, so no.

""BOUGH"" — doesn't end with ST.

We need ""S"" at position 4 and ""T"" at 5.

Another: ""GUSTO"" — but that starts with G U S T O, doesn't match.

What about ""OCCUR""? But pattern must have O at 2, S at 4, T at 5? Not.

We should focus on the pattern.

Possible words: 
- ""JOUST"": J O U S T
- ""YOUTH"" no, no S.
- ""TOUGH"" no.
- ""WOUST"" — not standard.
- ""COUST"" — not word, and C excluded.

Perhaps ""JOUST"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning joust, like knights.

Others?
- ""DOUSE"" but E excluded? And ends with E, not T.
- ""FOULS"" no T.

Another common one: ""LOUSE"" but E excluded? And pattern not match.

Another: ""POUTS"" — P O U T S? But position: P, O, U, T, S — that would be 4:T, 5:S, but we need position 4:S and 5:T — so S at 4, T at 5. This ends with S? S at 5, T at 4? No.

For ""POUTS"": positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:T, 5:S — doesn't match because we require position 4:S, but in this it's T, and position 5:S not T.

We specifically need position 4:S and 5:T.

So let's find words ending with S T? Like ...ST? But ""ST"" ending? Actually, few words end with ""S T"".

For example: ""BLAST"", but A excluded? Also positions: if ""BLAST"" , it's B L A S T — position 4:S? Position is 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T — but we need position 2:O? No, position 2 must be O.

So only the form: ? O ? S T

With ? being from allowed letters.

Other possibilities:
- ""JOUST"": J O U S T
- ""JOIST"" — J O I S T — but I is excluded, so not.
- ""TOAST"" — T O A S T — A excluded.
- ""BOOST"": B O O S T
- ""ROOST"" — R excluded.

""FOIST"" — F O I S T — I excluded.

""GHOST"" — G H O S T — positions: G, H, O, S, T — that's pos1:G, pos2:H? But we need pos2:O, which in ""GHOST"" is letter 3:O? No: G-H-O-S-T → position 1:G, 2:H, 3:O, 4:S, 5:T — so it doesn't have O at position 2; instead O at pos3.

Only words that have the letter ""O"" at the second position and end with ""ST""?

For instance, some words:
- ""BOOST""
- ""JOUST""
- ""DOUSE"" — but ends with E.
- ""GOUSE"" — archaic, not common.
- ""HOOSH"" — not.
- ""LOUSY"" — but Y and L? And positions: L O U S Y — not ST ending.

Another: ""POUTY"" — not.
""TOUSY"" — maybe, but not ST.

Perhaps ""BOOST"" or ""JOUST"" are the most common.

Also, ""TOHST"" — no.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,JOUST,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new guess after receiving feedback on ""crane"".
Feedback was: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

We must choose a completely new word that avoids these letters.

Common English letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We aim to use a word with high-frequency letters that haven't been tested yet.

Consider the most common consonants remaining: S, T, L, M, etc., and vowels: O, I, U. Note that E and A are excluded.

A good second guess might be ""STOMP"" or ""PLUMB"", but let's aim for maximum coverage.

Another popular choice is ""SLIPT"" but let's pick something with more common letters.

How about ""MOIST""? But M, O, I, S, T are all untested and common.

""MOIST"" uses M, O, I, S, T. All are new and common.

Alternatively, ""GHOUL"" uses less common letters.

Or ""PIOUS"" but that has P which is less common.

Since we have eliminated many vowels, we might want to test other vowels: O, I, U.

""OUIJA"" has J which is rare, and repeats letters? Also, it's 5 distinct? ""OUIJA"" is O,U,I,J,A but A is already excluded. So we can't use A.

We cannot use A because it's excluded.

So, possible words: ""MOIST"", ""GUILT"", ""BUOYS"", etc.

""BUOYS"" uses B, U, O, Y, S.

""MOIST"" seems solid: M, O, I, S, T.

Another option is ""STOOL"" but has repeated O.

We want all distinct letters to maximize coverage.

""MOIST"" has distinct letters.

Similarly, ""GUILD"" has G,U,I,L,D.

But S and T are more frequent than G and D? So ""MOIST"" might be better.

Let's go with ""MOIST"".

Guessed word: MOIST

<guess>moist</guess>Based on the previous feedback, none of the letters in ""crane"" (C, R, A, N, E) appear in the secret word. Therefore, I need to choose a new 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely. To maximize information gain, I'll select a word with high-frequency English letters not yet tested and ensure all letters are distinct for broader coverage. Common remaining letters include S, T, L, M, O, I, and others like B or P.

A strong second guess is ""moist"". It uses untested letters (M, O, I, S, T), which are among the most common letters in English. This should help narrow down possibilities significantly.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"": all letters excluded (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word)
2. ""moist"": 
   - O is correct and in the correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is O)
   - S and T are in the word but in the wrong position? Wait, let's check the feedback:
   Feedback: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(✓)

Wait, the feedback says for ""moist"":
- M: x (not in word)
- O: ✓ (correct and in correct position, so position 2 is O)
- I: x (not in word)
- S: ✓ (correct and in correct position? But the symbol is ✓, which means ""in the word and in the correct position"")
- T: ✓ (same, should be in the word and in correct position)

But let me read the feedback: ""FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(✓)""

So:
- Position 1: M → x (not in word)
- Position 2: O → ✓ (correct)
- Position 3: I → x (not in word)
- Position 4: S → ✓ (correct, so S must be in position 4)
- Position 5: T → ✓ (correct, so T must be in position 5)

Therefore, the current known information:
- The secret word has the form: ? O ? S T
  Because:
    Second letter: O
    Fourth letter: S
    Fifth letter: T

So the word pattern is: _ O _ S T

Also, from Guess 1, we know that C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.

From Guess 2, M and I are not in the word.

So, excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

We need to guess a word that fits the pattern _ O _ S T.

Now, letters not excluded: We have 26 letters minus excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I.

Excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, I → that's 7 letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But the word must be a valid English word. The pattern is ? O ? S T.

We need to fill the first and third positions.

Possible words: We need to think of 5-letter words ending with ""S T"", with the second letter O, and not containing any of the excluded letters.

Looking at the pattern: _ O _ S T

The third letter must be one of the remaining letters, and so must the first letter.

Common words? For example, could it be ""BOOST""? But ""BOOST"" has O twice? Wait, pattern: B O O S T? But wait, pattern requires ? O ? S T.

""BOOST"" would be positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:O, 4:S, 5:T? That doesn't match the pattern because in ""moist"" the feedback showed positions 4 and 5 as correct for S and T.

But in ""BOOST"", the positions are:
  Position 2: O (matches)
  Position 4: S (matches)
  Position 5: T (matches)
But position 3: O? But in our pattern, the third letter is unknown.

But now, what about the first letter: in ""BOOST"" it's B.

The feedback: if we guess ""BOOST"", what happens? But we haven't guessed it yet.

Our pattern: _ O _ S T.

""BOOST"" has O in position 2, O in position 3? But position 3 is not specified yet.

In our case, we know position 2 is O, position 4 is S, position 5 is T, but position 1 and 3 are unknown.

Excluded letters must be avoided.

Now, possible words fitting _ O _ S T:

Let's think:

- ""BOAST"" → has A? A is excluded (from guess1). And also pattern letters: B O A S T. But S is in pos4? Yes, but A is excluded.

- ""HOSTS"" → but has two S? Pattern is _ O _ S T -> if it ends with ST, then it must have S only at position 4? ""HOSTS"" is H O S T S -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:S, 4:T, 5:S -> that doesn't match because position 4 should be S? No, in our pattern, position 4 is S and position 5 is T.

So we need words like: ? O ? S T

Examples:
- ""BOOST"": B O O S T → letters: B, O, O, S, T → O repeated? But the pattern does not forbid repeated letters, unless we have information. From feedback, we don't get repetition info automatically.

But let's see: in the secret word, is there a repeated letter? We don't know yet.

But in ""BOOST"", it would fit the pattern: positions 2,4,5 are fixed, and O in position 3.

Another word: ""JOIST"" → but J is possible? But in previous guesses, J wasn't excluded? However, ""joist"" has J, O, I, S, T → but I is excluded (from guess2). So I cannot be present.

Similarly, other words.

List possible:

Words ending in ""ST"" with pattern: * O * S T? Actually, the suffix must be ""S T"" with S at 4 and T at 5.

So words: [letter1] O [letter3] S T

With constraints: letter1 and letter3 must be from the remaining set: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And not using C,R,A,N,E,M,I.

Now, ""BOOST"": uses B and O → O is allowed? O is in the word but it's at position 2, and we are using O again? Like positions: B, O, O, S, T → that has two O's.

Is O repeated allowed? We don't know. We must consider it as possible.

But also, ""BOOST"" might be valid.

Another possibility: ""FOUST""? Is that a word? Not common.

""HOIST"" → but ""HOIST"" is H O I S T → I is excluded.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" → but N excluded.

""MOIST"" we already guessed.

Remember, we need letter3 to not be excluded.

Possible letter3: must not be in excluded (C,R,A,N,E,M,I), and not have been guessed? We can reuse possibilities as long as not excluded.

Other words:
- ""JOUST"": J O U S T → positions: J, O, U, S, T → which matches pattern: 1:J, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T → letters: J, O, U, S, T → U is not excluded? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I — U is not in excluded, so possible.

Similarly, ""DOUST"" — not common? Is it a word? Or ""DOUBT"" but that ends with T? ""DOUBT"" is D O U B T — positions: D, O, U, B, T — not ending with ST.

Another word: ""ROUST"" — but R is excluded? R is in excluded list from guess1.

R excluded, so no.

""BOUGH"" — doesn't end with ST.

We need ""S"" at position 4 and ""T"" at 5.

Another: ""GUSTO"" — but that starts with G U S T O, doesn't match.

What about ""OCCUR""? But pattern must have O at 2, S at 4, T at 5? Not.

We should focus on the pattern.

Possible words: 
- ""JOUST"": J O U S T
- ""YOUTH"" no, no S.
- ""TOUGH"" no.
- ""WOUST"" — not standard.
- ""COUST"" — not word, and C excluded.

Perhaps ""JOUST"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning joust, like knights.

Others?
- ""DOUSE"" but E excluded? And ends with E, not T.
- ""FOULS"" no T.

Another common one: ""LOUSE"" but E excluded? And pattern not match.

Another: ""POUTS"" — P O U T S? But position: P, O, U, T, S — that would be 4:T, 5:S, but we need position 4:S and 5:T — so S at 4, T at 5. This ends with S? S at 5, T at 4? No.

For ""POUTS"": positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:T, 5:S — doesn't match because we require position 4:S, but in this it's T, and position 5:S not T.

We specifically need position 4:S and 5:T.

So let's find words ending with S T? Like ...ST? But ""ST"" ending? Actually, few words end with ""S T"".

For example: ""BLAST"", but A excluded? Also positions: if ""BLAST"" , it's B L A S T — position 4:S? Position is 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T — but we need position 2:O? No, position 2 must be O.

So only the form: ? O ? S T

With ? being from allowed letters.

Other possibilities:
- ""JOUST"": J O U S T
- ""JOIST"" — J O I S T — but I is excluded, so not.
- ""TOAST"" — T O A S T — A excluded.
- ""BOOST"": B O O S T
- ""ROOST"" — R excluded.

""FOIST"" — F O I S T — I excluded.

""GHOST"" — G H O S T — positions: G, H, O, S, T — that's pos1:G, pos2:H? But we need pos2:O, which in ""GHOST"" is letter 3:O? No: G-H-O-S-T → position 1:G, 2:H, 3:O, 4:S, 5:T — so it doesn't have O at position 2; instead O at pos3.

Only words that have the letter ""O"" at the second position and end with ""ST""?

For instance, some words:
- ""BOOST""
- ""JOUST""
- ""DOUSE"" — but ends with E.
- ""GOUSE"" — archaic, not common.
- ""HOOSH"" — not.
- ""LOUSY"" — but Y and L? And positions: L O U S Y — not ST ending.

Another: ""POUTY"" — not.
""TOUSY"" — maybe, but not ST.

Perhaps ""BOOST"" or ""JOUST"" are the most common.

Also, ""TOHST"" — no.

How about ""YOWST""? Not standard.

So realistically, common words: ""BOOST"", ""JOUST""

But ""BOOST"" has double O? But that's possible.

Now, from feedback, we also have that S and T are at the correct positions, and O at position 2.

For ""JOUST"": letters J, O, U, S, T — all except O,S,T are J and U. J is rare? But possible.

Similarly, for ""BOOST"": B, O, O, S, T.

Now, excluded letters: B is not excluded? B is allowed.

Also, we know that M is excluded, but B is not.

From Guess2, we have the T and S at correct positions? Yes, in feedback for ""moist"", T and S were ✓ meaning correct position.

Therefore, the secret word must end with ST? Since position 4 and 5 are S and T.

Pattern: _ O _ S T

Now, possible guesses:

We have only a few possibilities left, but we have 4 more tries? Since we've used 2 guesses.

We can guess either ""BOOST"" or ""JOUST"" directly? Or we can choose a guess that covers more possibilities.

But there might be only these two, unless I miss some.

Another word: ""TOUSS"" — not a word.

""YUMMY"" — not.

Or ""ZOWIE"" — no.

So probably ""BOOST"" and ""JOUST"".

But ""JOUST"" uses U and J, which are less common.

""BOOST"" uses B and O repeated.

Is there another word? ""GROUT"" — but G R O U T — positions: G, R, O, U, T — that has R excluded? No, R is excluded. Also position not ST ending.

Perhaps ""FROSH"" - no.

Another: ""FOUST"" - obsolete term.

But let's consider: we can guess ""JOUST"" or ""BOOST"".

However, we also need to exclude letters? No, we want to solve.

Since the pattern is fixed, we could guess one of them.

But by guessing ""BOOST"", we can confirm.

Similarly, guessing ""JOUST"".

But we must avoid excluded letters? We have a short list.

To maximize information, if we guess ""BOOST"" and it's wrong, we learn something.

Alternatively, if there are more possibilities, we should check.

Another word: ""DOUGH"" — no S.

Or ""PLUSH"" — no.

In fact, English words with pattern _ O _ S T are very few.

We have ""JOUST"" and ""BOOST"".

Also, ""YOUST"" - not.

Or ""WOOSH"" - not.

So I think those are the only common ones.

Let's verify with a dictionary mentally.

- BOOST: valid
- JOUST: valid

Yes.

Now, if we guess ""BOOST"", what feedback would we get if the word is ""BOOST""? Then all correct.

If the word is ""JOUST"", then for ""BOOST"": first letter B might be x if not present, O✓ (position), O might be ? But we don't know about the third letter.

Similarly, if we guess ""JOUST"", and the word is ""BOOST"", then J and U might incorrect.

Since we have limited tries, perhaps guess ""BOOST"" as it has B which is not tested.

But we know B isn't excluded? No, we haven't tested B.

Similarly for U and J.

So let's go with ""BOOST"".

But remember, in ""BOOST"", the third letter is O, which was already present? But we don't know if O can be repeated.

But the feedback symbols will tell.

So I will guess ""BOOST"".

But let's format the response.Based on the feedback:  
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): All letters C, R, A, N, E are excluded.  
- From Guess 2 (""moist""):  
  - O is correct and in position 2.  
  - S is correct and in position 4.  
  - T is correct and in position 5.  
  - M and I are excluded.  

The secret word must match the pattern: _ O _ S T (position 2: O, position 4: S, position 5: T). The excluded letters are C, R, A, N, E, M, I, so the unknown positions (1 and 3) must use letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Possible valid English words fitting the pattern include ""BOOST"" and ""JOUST"". ""BOOST"" (B O O S T) has distinct letters except for the double O, but repetitions are allowed unless excluded. ""JOUST"" (J O U S T) uses less common letters like J and U. Given that ""BOOST"" tests B (a high-frequency letter not yet tested) and quickly verifies the third position O, it is a strong candidate to guess. This guess will clarify if O is repeated and the status of B, potentially solving the puzzle or narrowing down further.  

Thus, the next guess is ""BOOST"".

B is allowed.\n\nAlso, we know that M is excluded, but B is not.\n\nFrom Guess2, we have the T and S at correct positions? Yes, in feedback for ""moist"", T and S were ✓ meaning correct position.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must end with ST? Since position 4 and 5 are S and T.\n\nPattern: _ O _ S T\n\nNow, possible guesses:\n\nWe have only a few possibilities left, but we have 4 more tries? Since we\'ve used 2 guesses.\n\nWe can guess either ""BOOST"" or ""JOUST"" directly? Or we can choose a guess that covers more possibilities.\n\nBut there might be only these two, unless I miss some.\n\nAnother word: ""TOUSS"" — not a word.\n\n""YUMMY"" — not.\n\nOr ""ZOWIE"" — no.\n\nSo probably ""BOOST"" and ""JOUST"".\n\nBut ""JOUST"" uses U and J, which are less common.\n\n""BOOST"" uses B and O repeated.\n\nIs there another word? ""GROUT"" — but G R O U T — positions: G, R, O, U, T — that has R excluded? No, R is excluded. Also position not ST ending.\n\nPerhaps ""FROSH"" - no.\n\nAnother: ""FOUST"" - obsolete term.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we can guess ""JOUST"" or ""BOOST"".\n\nHowever, we also need to exclude letters? No, we want to solve.\n\nSince the pattern is fixed, we could guess one of them.\n\nBut by guessing ""BOOST"", we can confirm.\n\nSimilarly, guessing ""JOUST"".\n\nBut we must avoid excluded letters? We have a short list.\n\nTo maximize information, if we guess ""BOOST"" and it\'s wrong, we learn something.\n\nAlternatively, if there are more possibilities, we should check.\n\nAnother word: ""DOUGH"" — no S.\n\nOr ""PLUSH"" — no.\n\nIn fact, English words with pattern _ O _ S T are very few.\n\nWe have ""JOUST"" and ""BOOST"".\n\nAlso, ""YOUST"" - not.\n\nOr ""WOOSH"" - not.\n\nSo I think those are the only common ones.\n\nLet\'s verify with a dictionary mentally.\n\n- BOOST: valid\n- JOUST: valid\n\nYes.\n\nNow, if we guess ""BOOST"", what feedback would we get if the word is ""BOOST""? Then all correct.\n\nIf the word is ""JOUST"", then for ""BOOST"": first letter B might be x if not present, O✓ (position), O might be ? But we don\'t know about the third letter.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""JOUST"", and the word is ""BOOST"", then J and U might incorrect.\n\nSince we have limited tries, perhaps guess ""BOOST"" as it has B which is not tested.\n\nBut we know B isn\'t excluded? No, we haven\'t tested B.\n\nSimilarly for U and J.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""BOOST"".\n\nBut remember, in ""BOOST"", the third letter is O, which was already present? But we don\'t know if O can be repeated.\n\nBut the feedback symbols will tell.\n\nSo I will guess ""BOOST"".\n\nBut let\'s format the response.Based on the feedback:  \n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): All letters C, R, A, N, E are excluded.  \n- From Guess 2 (""moist""):  \n  - O is correct and in position 2.  \n  - S is correct and in position 4.  \n  - T is correct and in position 5.  \n  - M and I are excluded.  \n\nThe secret word must match the pattern: _ O _ S T (position 2: O, position 4: S, position 5: T). The excluded letters are C, R, A, N, E, M, I, so the unknown positions (1 and 3) must use letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n\nPossible valid English words fitting the pattern include ""BOOST"" and ""JOUST"". ""BOOST"" (B O O S T) has distinct letters except for the double O, but repetitions are allowed unless excluded. ""JOUST"" (J O U S T) uses less common letters like J and U. Given that ""BOOST"" tests B (a high-frequency letter not yet tested) and quickly verifies the third position O, it is a strong candidate to guess. This guess will clarify if O is repeated and the status of B, potentially solving the puzzle or narrowing down further.  \n\nThus, the next guess is ""BOOST"".\n\n<guess>boost</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(✓)\nGuess 3: boost -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) O(-) S(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the word -> excluded.
2. ""moist"": 
   - M: not in word (x)
   - O: correct and in position (✓) -> so position 2 is O.
   - I: not in word (x)
   - S: correct and in position (✓) -> position 4 is S.
   - T: correct and in position (✓) -> position 5 is T.
   Therefore, the word pattern is: _ O _ S T

3. ""boost"":
   - B: not in word (x) -> so B is excluded.
   - O: correct and in position (✓) -> position 2 is O (already known).
   - O: in the word but wrong position (-) -> so there is another O in the word, but not at position 3.
   - S: correct and in position (✓) -> position 4 is S (known).
   - T: correct and in position (✓) -> position 5 is T (known).

Now, from ""boost"" feedback:
- The first O (position 2) is correct, so that O is fixed.
- The second O (position 3) is marked as present but wrong position. This means there is at least one more O in the word, but it cannot be at position 3. Since position 2 is already O, and we have an extra O that must be at position 1 or position 3? But position 3 is the only other possibility? However, the feedback says the O at position 3 is wrong position, meaning that the letter at position 3 is not O, but there is an O elsewhere? But we already have O at position 2. So the extra O must be at position 1? Because positions 4 and 5 are S and T, which are fixed and not O.

The word pattern is: _ O _ S T

The feedback for ""boost"" at position 3 (the second O) is marked as (-), meaning that the letter at that position (which was O in the guess) is not O in the secret word, but there is an O in the secret word that we haven't placed correctly? But we have O at position 2, which is correct. The (-) for the second O indicates that the secret word has an additional O that is not at position 3.

But the secret word has at least two O's: one at position 2, and one elsewhere. The elsewhere can only be position 1, because positions 4 and 5 are S and T, which are not O.

Therefore, the secret word must have O at position 1 and position 2? But position 1 is the first letter, and position 2 is O. So the word would be O O _ S T.

But we have the pattern: position 1: O, position 2: O, position 3: ?, position 4: S, position 5: T.

But in the feedback for ""boost"", we guessed B at position 1 (which was wrong) and O at position 3 (which was also wrong, but the O is present elsewhere). Now, if the secret word has O at position 1, then when we guessed ""boost"", the first letter was B (wrong) and the third letter was O (which is not in the secret word at that position, but the O is at position 1?).

Let me clarify:

- In ""boost"" guess: 
  - Position 1: B -> x (not in word)
  - Position 2: O -> ✓ (correct)
  - Position 3: O -> - (this O is in the word but not at this position)
  - Position 4: S -> ✓
  - Position 5: T -> ✓

The (-) at position 3 means that the secret word has an O, but not at position 3. Since we know position 2 is O, the only other possible position for the extra O is position 1? Because positions 4 and 5 are S and T.

Therefore, the secret word must have O at position 1 and position 2? So the pattern is O O _ S T.

But then, what about the third position? It must be a letter that is not O, and not excluded.

Now, excluded letters so far: from guess1: C, R, A, N, E; from guess2: M, I; from guess3: B. So excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, B.

Remaining letters: D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The word pattern: O O _ S T

We need a 5-letter word of the form O O ? S T, where ? is one of the remaining letters.

What words are there? 

- ""OOHST""? Not a word.
- ""OOZES""? But E is excluded, and it ends with ES, not ST.
- ""OOTID""? Not common.
- ""FOOTS""? But F is possible, but pattern must start with OO? ""FOOTS"" is F O O T S, not matching.

Common words: ""ROOTS"" but R excluded.

""MOONS"" but M excluded and ends with NS.

""BOOKS"" but K and S? ""BOOKS"" is B O O K S, but B excluded and ends with KS, not ST.

""BOOTS"" but B excluded and ends with TS? ""BOOTS"" is B O O T S -> positions: B (1), O(2), O(3), T(4), S(5) -> but we need position 4:S and 5:T, so it would be S at 4 and T at 5? In ""BOOTS"", position 4 is T and 5 is S, which is the opposite.

We need the pattern: position 1:O, 2:O, 3:?, 4:S, 5:T.

So the word must end with S at 4 and T at 5, so the last two letters are ST.

Therefore, the word is O O ? S T.

Is there any English word like that?

- ""OORIE""? Not.
- ""OOSHY""? Not.
- ""OOTSY""? ""OOTSY"" is a word? It might be informal, but let's see: O-O-T-S-Y? That would be positions: O, O, T, S, Y? But we need position 4:S and 5:T? No, position 4 should be S and 5 T, but in ""OOTSY"" it would be T at 3, S at 4, Y at 5? Not T at 5.

We need the fifth letter to be T.

Another: ""OOPST""? Not a word.

""OOSPT""? No.

Perhaps ""OOHST"" is not valid.

Maybe I made a mistake.

Another possibility: the secret word has only one O? But the feedback for ""boost"" says that the second O (position 3) is present but wrong position. Since position 2 is O and correct, if there is only one O, then the O at position 3 should not be present, so it would be marked x, not -. But it is marked -, meaning there is another O.

But if the word has two O's, one at position 2 and one at position 1, then the pattern is O O ? S T.

But what words are there? ""OONST""? Not.

""OOPST""? Not.

""OOTHS""? ""OOTHS"" is O O T H S -> positions: O, O, T, H, S -> then position 4 is H? Not S. Position 5 is S? Not T.

We need position 4 to be S and 5 to be T.

So the only possibility is that the third letter is S? But then it would be O O S S T? But position 4 is S, so it would be O O S S T? That has two S's? But position 3 is S and position 4 is S? Then the word would be ""OOSST"" which is not a word.

Perhaps the extra O is not at position 1? But where else? Position 3 is not, position 4 and 5 are fixed as S and T.

Unless the word has more than 5 letters? No, it's 5-letter.

Perhaps the feedback means that the O is present but not at position 3, and it could be that the secret word has O at position 2 and that's the only O, but then the O at position 3 in the guess should be marked x, not -, because there is no other O. But it is marked -, so there must be another O.

But the only positions available are 1 and 3. Position 3 is marked as not having O, so it must be at position 1.

Therefore, the word must start with O, then O at position 2, then some letter at 3, then S at 4, T at 5.

But what words are there? Let's search for words starting with ""OO"" and ending with ""ST"".

""OOBIT""? No.

""OOFTS""? Not common.

""OOMPH"" ends with H.

""OONTS""? Not.

""OOPAK""? No.

""OORIE"" no.

""OOSES"" ends with ES.

""OOTID"" no.

""OOZED"" ends with ED.

I can't find any common English word that fits ""OO?ST"".

Perhaps I misinterpreted the feedback.

Let's re-read the feedback for ""boost"": B(x) O(✓) O(-) S(✓) T(✓)

The first O is at position 2: correct.

The second O is at position 3: present but wrong position.

This means that the secret word has an O, but not at position 3. Since position 2 is O, the secret word has at least two O's, and the second O must be at position 1 or position 4 or 5. But position 4 is S and position 5 is T, which are fixed and not O. So the only possibility is position 1.

But if position 1 is O, then the word is O O ? S T.

But no common word exists for that pattern.

Unless the secret word has O at position 2 and the extra O at position 1, but then what is the word?

Perhaps ""JOOST"" but J is allowed? ""JOOST"" is J O O S T -> positions: J, O, O, S, T -> which would be position 1:J, 2:O, 3:O, 4:S, 5:T. But in this case, for the guess ""boost"", we have:

- Position 1: B (x) -> not J
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 3: O -> in the secret word, position 3 is O, so it should be marked ✓, not -. But in feedback, it is marked -, which means it is in the word but not at that position. But if the secret word has O at position 3, it should be ✓.

Contradiction.

If the secret word is ""JOOST"", then when we guess ""boost"":
- Position 1: B vs J -> not match, and B not in word? B is not in ""JOOST"", so x.
- Position 2: O vs O -> ✓
- Position 3: O vs O -> ✓ (because it matches)
- Position 4: S vs S -> ✓
- Position 5: T vs T -> ✓

But in the feedback, position 3 was marked (-), not (✓). So it cannot be that position 3 is O in the secret word.

Therefore, ""JOOST"" is not possible.

Similarly, for any word with O at position 3, it would have been marked ✓ if present.

But it was marked -, so position 3 is not O.

So the secret word has an O that is not at position 3, but it must be at position 1.

But then what is the word?

Perhaps the word has more than two O's? But unlikely.

Another idea: the secret word has O at position 2 and also at position 1, but position 1 is O, so the word is O O ? S T.

But as above, no common word.

Perhaps the feedback for position 3 in ""boost"" is (-) because the secret word has only one O, but it is at position 2, and the O at position 3 in the guess is not in the word, so it should be x, not -. But it is marked -, so it must be in the word.

Unless the feedback is wrong, but we have to trust it.

Perhaps the secret word has O at position 2, and the extra O at a different position, but positions 4 and 5 are S and T, so not.

Unless S or T is O? But S and T are fixed and not O.

S is at 4, T at 5, both are not O.

So the only position left is position 1.

So we must have position 1 as O.

But then the word is O O ? S T.

Now, what letter can be at position 3? It must be a letter that is not excluded and not O.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,B

Remaining: D,F,G,H,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Now, is there any word ""OO"" + letter + ""ST""?

For example, ""OOHST"" is not a word.

""OOGST""? Not.

""OOKST""? Not.

""OOLST"" -> ""oolst"" not a word.

""OOMST"" not.

""OONST"" not.

""OOPST"" not.

""OOQST"" not.

""OORST"" but R is excluded.

""OOSST"" not a word.

""OOTST"" not.

""OOUST"" -> ""ooust"" not standard.

""OOVST"" not.

""OOWST"" not.

""OOXST"" not.

""OOYST"" -> ""OOYST"" is not, but ""OYST"" is oyster, but not starting with OO.

""OZST"" not.

Perhaps ""GHOST"" but position 2 is H, not O.

I think I have to consider that the word might be ""OOTHE"" but E excluded.

Another possibility: the secret word has the O at position 2, and the extra O is at position 1, but the word is not common or I'm missing it.

Perhaps ""ROOFS"" but R excluded and ends with FS.

Let's list all 5-letter words ending with ""ST"" and second letter O.

From memory, common ones are ""HOSTS"", ""TOAST"", ""ROAST"", ""COAST"", ""BOAST"", but all have excluded letters or wrong pattern.

""HOSTS"": H O S T S -> position 2:O, position 3:S, position 4:T, position 5:S -> not S at 4 and T at 5.

We need position 4:S and 5:T, so the last two must be ""ST"", not ""TS"".

So words ending with ""ST"".

With second letter O.

So the pattern is: _ O _ S T

And from feedback, position 1 must be O? Because of the extra O.

But let's assume that, and see.

Perhaps the word is ""OOZES"" but ends with ES, not ST.

I think there's a mistake in the feedback interpretation.

Let's re-examine the feedback for ""boost"":

- B(x) : B not in word
- O(✓) : O at position 2 correct
- O(-) : O is in the word but not at position 3
- S(✓) : S at position 4 correct
- T(✓) : T at position 5 correct

The O at position 3 in the guess is not in the correct position, but it is present in the word. Since position 2 is O and correct, the secret word must have at least two O's. The only position for the second O is position 1, because 3,4,5 are not available (3 is not O, 4 and 5 are S and T).

So position 1 must be O.

Therefore, the word is O O ? S T.

Now, for the third letter, it must be a letter that is not O and not excluded.

But what word is that? Perhaps ""OOPST"" is not, but maybe ""OOTHS"" is close but not.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word is ""FOOTS"", but F O O T S -> position 4 is T, not S, and position 5 is S, not T.

Not matching.

Perhaps the feedback for position 4 and 5 in ""moist"" was correct, so it must be S at 4 and T at 5.

Let's list all possible words matching _ O _ S T with no excluded letters.

Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,B

Remaining: D,F,G,H,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Words:
- ""DOUTS"" -> D O U T S? Positions: D, O, U, T, S -> position 4:T, 5:S -> not S at 4 and T at 5.
- ""FOIST"" -> F O I S T, but I excluded.
- ""GOATS"" -> G O A T S, A excluded.
- ""HOTES"" -> H O T E S, E excluded.
- ""JOUST"" -> J O U S T -> positions: J, O, U, S, T -> matches pattern: 1:J, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T -> and letters: J not excluded, O not, U not, S and T are in. I is not in this word, so not excluded. J is allowed.

""JOUST"" is a word.

In ""JOUST"", how many O's? One O at position 2.

When we guessed ""boost"", which has O at position 2 and position 3.

For ""JOUST"":
- Position 2: O -> matches, so ✓
- Position 3: U -> not O, so the O in the guess at position 3 is not in the secret word? But ""JOUST"" has only one O, at position 2. So the O at position 3 in ""boost"" is not in the secret word, so it should be marked x, not -.

But in feedback, it was marked -, which means it is in the word but wrong position. But if ""JOUST"" has only one O, it should be x for the second O.

Contradiction.

Therefore, ""JOUST"" cannot be the word because it has only one O.

Similarly, ""BOOST"" has two O's, but we guessed it and got B(x) and the second O as (-), which is consistent with ""BOOST"" not being the word because B is not in it, and the second O is present but not at position 3 if the word has O at position 1 and 2.

But for ""BOOST"" to be the word, position 3 would be O, so it should be ✓, not -.

I'm confused.

Let's assume the secret word is ""LOOPS"", but L O O P S -> positions: L, O, O, P, S -> position 4:P, 5:S -> not S at 4 and T at 5.

Not matching.

Another word: ""POOTS"" -> P O O T S -> position 4:T, 5:S -> not.

I think the only way is to accept that position 1 is O, so the word is O O ? S T, and the third letter must be a consonant that can form a word.

Perhaps ""OOH S T"" but not.

Or in English, there is ""OOTU"" etc., but not ending with ST.

Perhaps the word is ""OCTET"" but pattern not match.

I think I have to consider that the feedback might have a mistake, or I missed a word.

Another possibility: the secret word has O at position 2, and the extra O at position 5? But position 5 is T, fixed, so not.

Unless the T is not fixed? But from ""moist"" feedback, T is at position 5 and correct.

Similarly for S at 4.

So no.

Perhaps the feedback for ""moist"" position 5 T is correct, but in the secret word, T is at position 5, so it can't be O.

So I think the only logical conclusion is that position 1 is O, and the word is O O ? S T.

For the third position, it must be a letter that forms a valid word.

Let's think of words like "" oolith"" but that's 6 letters.

""Oocyte"" not 5.

Perhaps ""ootid"" but not common.

Maybe in Wordle, the word list includes less common words.

But let's assume we can use ""OONST"" or something, but it's not valid.

Perhaps the extra O is not at position 1, but the feedback is for the letter, not the position.

Another idea: in ""boost"", the first O is at position 2, correct. The second O is at position 3, and it is marked as present but wrong position. This means that in the secret word, there is an O that is not at position 2 or 3? But position 2 is O, so it is at position 2, and the additional O is elsewhere.

But where? Only position 1.

Perhaps the secret word has O at position 2 and also at position 4 or 5, but position 4 is S, position 5 is T, so not.

Unless S or T is O, but they are fixed.

I think I have to accept that position 1 is O.

So the word is O O ? S T.

For the third letter, let's choose from remaining letters.

Remaining letters: D,F,G,H,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We can guess a word that has O at position 1, O at position 2, and a letter from the remaining at position 3, S at 4, T at 5.

For example, ""OOHST"" – not a word, but let's see if there is any.

Perhaps ""OOPST"" is not, but ""OOZES"" is not.

Another thought: maybe the word is ""FIRST"" but F I R S T, position 2:I excluded, not O.

I think I need to look for words with second letter O and ending with ST.

For example, ""HOSTS"" has second letter O? H O S T S, so position 2:O, but position 3:S, position 4:T, position 5:S, so not S at 4 and T at 5.

Similarly, ""COSTS"" C O S T S, position 2:O, 3:S, 4:T, 5:S.

Not.

""DUSTS"" D U S T S, position 2:U, not O.

Only ""JOUST"" and ""BOOST"" have position 2:O and ending with ST? ""JOUST"" is J O U S T, position 4:S, 5:T.

""BOOST"" is B O O S T, position 4:S, 5:T.

But ""BOOST"" we already guessed, and it's not the word because B is not in it, and the second O is not at position 3.

For ""JOUST"", it has only one O, so the second O in ""boost"" should not be present, but feedback says it is present.

So the secret word must have two O's.

Therefore, it must be a word with two O's, position 2 is O, and the other O at position 1, and positions 4 and 5 are S and T.

So O O ? S T.

Perhaps the word is ""OOTHE"" but E excluded.

Or ""OONCE"" not.

I think I have to consider that the third letter is H, for ""OOHED"" not.

Perhaps ""OOTUS"" not.

I recall that in Wordle, there is a word ""OOTID"" but it's not common, and ends with ID.

Another idea: perhaps the feedback for position 3 in ""boost"" is (-) because the secret word has O at position 1, and when we guessed ""boost"", the O at position 3 is the same O as position 1? But in Wordle, if there is only one O, and it is at position 1, then the O at position 3 should be marked x, because the O is already accounted for at position 2? No, in Wordle, feedback is per letter in the guess, not per letter in the word.

Let's recall Wordle rules: if a letter is in the word but not in the correct position, it gets a yellow (-). If a letter is in the word and in correct position, green (✓). If not in the word, gray (x).

For repeated letters, it's a bit tricky. If the guess has a repeated letter, and the word has fewer instances, then the extras are marked gray.

For example, if the word has one O, and you guess a word with two O's, the first O might be green or yellow, and the second O will be gray if there's only one.

In this case, for ""boost"" guess:
- If the secret word has only one O at position 2, then:
  - Position 2: O -> green (✓)
  - Position 3: O -> gray (x) because there's only one O, and it's already used.
- If the secret word has two O's, say at positions 1 and 2, then:
  - Position 2: O -> green (✓)
  - Position 3: O -> yellow (-) if position 3 is not O, but there is another O at position 1.

In the feedback, position 3 is yellow (-), so it means the secret word has at least two O's, and the O at position 3 in the guess is one of the extra O's not at position 3.

Since position 2 is green, the second O must be at position 1.

Therefore, the secret word has O at position 1 and position 2.

So the pattern is O O ? S T.

Now, for the third position, it must be a letter that is not O, and not excluded.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,B

Remaining: D,F,G,H,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We need to guess a word that fits O O ? S T.

Since there are few possibilities, we can guess with a word that uses a common letter for position 3.

For example, ""FO O H S T"" not a word.

""GO O H S T"" not.

""HO O H S T"" not.

""LO O H S T"" not.

""PO O H S T"" not.

""U"" is vowel, ""OOUS T"" not.

Perhaps ""OOZES"" is the closest, but ends with ES.

I think for the sake of the game, we might have to guess ""OOHED"" but E excluded.

Perhaps the word is ""OOTUS"" but ends with US.

I found a word: ""OOPST"" is not, but ""OPSET"" not.

Another: ""OONST"" is not, but ""OONTS"" is a word? O O N T S, but N is excluded, and position 4:T, 5:S, not ST.

Not matching.

Perhaps ""OOTHS"" is O O T H S, position 4:H, 5:S, not.

I think I have to give up and guess a word that fits the pattern with a letter that might work.

For example, ""OOH S T"" but not, so let's use ""DO O S T"" but ""doost"" not a word.

Perhaps ""GHOST"" but position 2 is H.

I think there's a mistake; perhaps the feedback for ""moist"" position 4 and 5 is not both correct? But it is.

Let's double-check the feedback.

Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(✓)

So S at position 4 is correct, T at position 5 is correct.

Guess 3: boost -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) O(-) S(✓) T(✓)

So for position 3, O is present but not at position 3.

Therefore, the only possibility is position 1 is O.

So the word is O O ? S T.

For the third letter, let's choose H, for ""OOHED"" not, or K for ""OOKST"" not.

Perhaps ""OOLST"" for ""oolite"" but not.

I recall that ""OOPECK"" not.

Perhaps in this context, we can use ""OUGHT"" but not ending with ST.

I think I need to choose a guess that has O at position 1, a new letter at position 3, and S and T at 4 and 5.

For example, ""OODS T"" not.

Or ""OOT"" not.

Perhaps the word is ""ROOTS"" but R excluded and ends with TS.

I think for the next guess, we should guess ""OOZES"" even though it ends with ES, but it doesn't match the pattern.

Perhaps the pattern is wrong.

Another idea: perhaps the S and T are not at position 4 and 5 for the secret word? But the feedback says they are correct position.

Let's assume the feedback is correct.

Perhaps the secret word has the O at position 2, and the extra O at position 4, but position 4 is S, so not.

I think I have to make a guess.

Let's guess ""JOUST"" to test.

If we guess ""JOUST"":
- Position 1: J
- Position 2: O (correct)
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: S (correct)
- Position 5: T (correct)

If the secret word has only one O, then U at position 3 might be correct or not.

But from feedback, we know there is another O, so if ""JOUST"" has only one O, it won't have the extra O, so the feedback for ""JOUST"" will show that there is no second O.

Similarly, if we guess ""LOOPS"", but position 4 is P, not S.

Not.

Perhaps ""POOTS"" P O O T S, position 4:T, 5:S, not S at 4.

I think the only way is to guess a word with O at position 1.

So let's guess ""OOhed"" but not 5 letters with ST.

Perhaps ""OOTHE"" is not.

I found a word: ""OUNCE"" but E excluded and not ST.

I think for the next guess, we can guess ""DOUBT"" but not ST.

Let's ignore the pattern for a moment and guess a word that has O at position 1, and other letters.

For example, ""OUPHE"" not.

Perhaps ""ADIEU"" but letters excluded.

I think I need to choose ""JOUST"" as a guess to test the O.

So I'll guess ""JOUST"".

But let's see the response format.

Perhaps the word is ""FOCUS"" but not.

I give up; let's guess ""JOUST"".

<guess>joust</guess>
</think>
After reviewing the feedback from previous guesses, the following is known:

- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E (from Guess 1), M, I (from Guess 2), and B (from Guess 3). These letters cannot be in the secret word.
- **Correct positions**: 
  - Position 2: O (from Guess 2 and confirmed in Guess 3).
  - Position 4: S (from Guess 2 and confirmed in Guess 3).
  - Position 5: T (from Guess 2 and confirmed in Guess 3).
- **Additional information from Guess 3 (""boost"")**: 
  - The second O (at position 3) is marked as present but in the wrong position (-), indicating the secret word contains at least two O's. Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed as S and T, and position 2 is O, the only possible location for the second O is position 1. Thus, the secret word must start with O, resulting in the pattern: **O O _ S T**.
- **Remaining letters**: The valid letters for position 3 are from the set not excluded: D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Given the pattern O O _ S T, the secret word must be a valid English word. However, common words like ""boost"" (already guessed) and ""joist"" (contains excluded I) are invalid. ""Joust"" is a possible word that fits the pattern with U in position 3, but it has only one O, which conflicts with the feedback requiring two O's. Other combinations like ""oohst"" or ""oogst"" are not valid words. 

After considering all possibilities, ""joust"" is chosen as the next guess to test the presence of the second O and the letter U. If ""joust"" is incorrect, the feedback will provide clarity on the status of U and the O count, narrowing down the options for the next guess.

<guess>joust</guess>",joust,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the word -> excluded.
2. ""moist"": 
   - M: not in word (x)
   - O: correct and in position (✓) -> so position 2 is O.
   - I: not in word (x)
   - S: correct and in position (✓) -> position 4 is S.
   - T: correct and in position (✓) -> position 5 is T.
   Therefore, the word pattern is: _ O _ S T

3. ""boost"":
   - B: not in word (x) -> so B is excluded.
   - O: correct and in position (✓) -> position 2 is O (already known).
   - O: in the word but wrong position (-) -> so there is another O in the word, but not at position 3.
   - S: correct and in position (✓) -> position 4 is S (known).
   - T: correct and in position (✓) -> position 5 is T (known).

Now, from ""boost"" feedback:
- The first O (position 2) is correct, so that O is fixed.
- The second O (position 3) is marked as present but wrong position. This means there is at least one more O in the word, but it cannot be at position 3. Since position 2 is already O, and we have an extra O that must be at position 1 or position 3? But position 3 is the only other possibility? However, the feedback says the O at position 3 is wrong position, meaning that the letter at position 3 is not O, but there is an O elsewhere? But we already have O at position 2. So the extra O must be at position 1? Because positions 4 and 5 are S and T, which are fixed and not O.

The word pattern is: _ O _ S T

The feedback for ""boost"" at position 3 (the second O) is marked as (-), meaning that the letter at that position (which was O in the guess) is not O in the secret word, but there is an O in the secret word that we haven't placed correctly? But we have O at position 2, which is correct. The (-) for the second O indicates that the secret word has an additional O that is not at position 3.

But the secret word has at least two O's: one at position 2, and one elsewhere. The elsewhere can only be position 1, because positions 4 and 5 are S and T, which are not O.

Therefore, the secret word must have O at position 1 and position 2? But position 1 is the first letter, and position 2 is O. So the word would be O O _ S T.

But we have the pattern: position 1: O, position 2: O, position 3: ?, position 4: S, position 5: T.

But in the feedback for ""boost"", we guessed B at position 1 (which was wrong) and O at position 3 (which was also wrong, but the O is present elsewhere). Now, if the secret word has O at position 1, then when we guessed ""boost"", the first letter was B (wrong) and the third letter was O (which is not in the secret word at that position, but the O is at position 1?).

Let me clarify:

- In ""boost"" guess: 
  - Position 1: B -> x (not in word)
  - Position 2: O -> ✓ (correct)
  - Position 3: O -> - (this O is in the word but not at this position)
  - Position 4: S -> ✓
  - Position 5: T -> ✓

The (-) at position 3 means that the secret word has an O, but not at position 3. Since we know position 2 is O, the only other possible position for the extra O is position 1? Because positions 4 and 5 are S and T.

Therefore, the secret word must have O at position 1 and position 2? So the pattern is O O _ S T.

But then, what about the third position? It must be a letter that is not O, and not excluded.

Now, excluded letters so far: from guess1: C, R, A, N, E; from guess2: M, I; from guess3: B. So excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, B.

Remaining letters: D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The word pattern: O O _ S T

We need a 5-letter word of the form O O ? S T, where ? is one of the remaining letters.

What words are there? 

- ""OOHST""? Not a word.
- ""OOZES""? But E is excluded, and it ends with ES, not ST.
- ""OOTID""? Not common.
- ""FOOTS""? But F is possible, but pattern must start with OO? ""FOOTS"" is F O O T S, not matching.

Common words: ""ROOTS"" but R excluded.

""MOONS"" but M excluded and ends with NS.

""BOOKS"" but K and S? ""BOOKS"" is B O O K S, but B excluded and ends with KS, not ST.

""BOOTS"" but B excluded and ends with TS? ""BOOTS"" is B O O T S -> positions: B (1), O(2), O(3), T(4), S(5) -> but we need position 4:S and 5:T, so it would be S at 4 and T at 5? In ""BOOTS"", position 4 is T and 5 is S, which is the opposite.

We need the pattern: position 1:O, 2:O, 3:?, 4:S, 5:T.

So the word must end with S at 4 and T at 5, so the last two letters are ST.

Therefore, the word is O O ? S T.

Is there any English word like that?

- ""OORIE""? Not.
- ""OOSHY""? Not.
- ""OOTSY""? ""OOTSY"" is a word? It might be informal, but let's see: O-O-T-S-Y? That would be positions: O, O, T, S, Y? But we need position 4:S and 5:T? No, position 4 should be S and 5 T, but in ""OOTSY"" it would be T at 3, S at 4, Y at 5? Not T at 5.

We need the fifth letter to be T.

Another: ""OOPST""? Not a word.

""OOSPT""? No.

Perhaps ""OOHST"" is not valid.

Maybe I made a mistake.

Another possibility: the secret word has only one O? But the feedback for ""boost"" says that the second O (position 3) is present but wrong position. Since position 2 is O and correct, if there is only one O, then the O at position 3 should not be present, so it would be marked x, not -. But it is marked -, meaning there is another O.

But if the word has two O's, one at position 2 and one at position 1, then the pattern is O O ? S T.

But what words are there? ""OONST""? Not.

""OOPST""? Not.

""OOTHS""? ""OOTHS"" is O O T H S -> positions: O, O, T, H, S -> then position 4 is H? Not S. Position 5 is S? Not T.

We need position 4 to be S and 5 to be T.

So the only possibility is that the third letter is S? But then it would be O O S S T? But position 4 is S, so it would be O O S S T? That has two S's? But position 3 is S and position 4 is S? Then the word would be ""OOSST"" which is not a word.

Perhaps the extra O is not at position 1? But where else? Position 3 is not, position 4 and 5 are fixed as S and T.

Unless the word has more than 5 letters? No, it's 5-letter.

Perhaps the feedback means that the O is present but not at position 3, and it could be that the secret word has O at position 2 and that's the only O, but then the O at position 3 in the guess should be marked x, not -, because there is no other O. But it is marked -, so there must be another O.

But the only positions available are 1 and 3. Position 3 is marked as not having O, so it must be at position 1.

Therefore, the word must start with O, then O at position 2, then some letter at 3, then S at 4, T at 5.

But what words are there? Let's search for words starting with ""OO"" and ending with ""ST"".

""OOBIT""? No.

""OOFTS""? Not common.

""OOMPH"" ends with H.

""OONTS""? Not.

""OOPAK""? No.

""OORIE"" no.

""OOSES"" ends with ES.

""OOTID"" no.

""OOZED"" ends with ED.

I can't find any common English word that fits ""OO?ST"".

Perhaps I misinterpreted the feedback.

Let's re-read the feedback for ""boost"": B(x) O(✓) O(-) S(✓) T(✓)

The first O is at position 2: correct.

The second O is at position 3: present but wrong position.

This means that the secret word has an O, but not at position 3. Since position 2 is O, the secret word has at least two O's, and the second O must be at position 1 or position 4 or 5. But position 4 is S and position 5 is T, which are fixed and not O. So the only possibility is position 1.

But if position 1 is O, then the word is O O ? S T.

But no common word exists for that pattern.

Unless the secret word has O at position 2 and the extra O at position 1, but then what is the word?

Perhaps ""JOOST"" but J is allowed? ""JOOST"" is J O O S T -> positions: J, O, O, S, T -> which would be position 1:J, 2:O, 3:O, 4:S, 5:T. But in this case, for the guess ""boost"", we have:

- Position 1: B (x) -> not J
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 3: O -> in the secret word, position 3 is O, so it should be marked ✓, not -. But in feedback, it is marked -, which means it is in the word but not at that position. But if the secret word has O at position 3, it should be ✓.

Contradiction.

If the secret word is ""JOOST"", then when we guess ""boost"":
- Position 1: B vs J -> not match, and B not in word? B is not in ""JOOST"", so x.
- Position 2: O vs O -> ✓
- Position 3: O vs O -> ✓ (because it matches)
- Position 4: S vs S -> ✓
- Position 5: T vs T -> ✓

But in the feedback, position 3 was marked (-), not (✓). So it cannot be that position 3 is O in the secret word.

Therefore, ""JOOST"" is not possible.

Similarly, for any word with O at position 3, it would have been marked ✓ if present.

But it was marked -, so position 3 is not O.

So the secret word has an O that is not at position 3, but it must be at position 1.

But then what is the word?

Perhaps the word has more than two O's? But unlikely.

Another idea: the secret word has O at position 2 and also at position 1, but position 1 is O, so the word is O O ? S T.

But as above, no common word.

Perhaps the feedback for position 3 in ""boost"" is (-) because the secret word has only one O, but it is at position 2, and the O at position 3 in the guess is not in the word, so it should be x, not -. But it is marked -, so it must be in the word.

Unless the feedback is wrong, but we have to trust it.

Perhaps the secret word has O at position 2, and the extra O at a different position, but positions 4 and 5 are S and T, so not.

Unless S or T is O? But S and T are fixed and not O.

S is at 4, T at 5, both are not O.

So the only position left is position 1.

So we must have position 1 as O.

But then the word is O O ? S T.

Now, what letter can be at position 3? It must be a letter that is not excluded and not O.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,B

Remaining: D,F,G,H,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Now, is there any word ""OO"" + letter + ""ST""?

For example, ""OOHST"" is not a word.

""OOGST""? Not.

""OOKST""? Not.

""OOLST"" -> ""oolst"" not a word.

""OOMST"" not.

""OONST"" not.

""OOPST"" not.

""OOQST"" not.

""OORST"" but R is excluded.

""OOSST"" not a word.

""OOTST"" not.

""OOUST"" -> ""ooust"" not standard.

""OOVST"" not.

""OOWST"" not.

""OOXST"" not.

""OOYST"" -> ""OOYST"" is not, but ""OYST"" is oyster, but not starting with OO.

""OZST"" not.

Perhaps ""GHOST"" but position 2 is H, not O.

I think I have to consider that the word might be ""OOTHE"" but E excluded.

Another possibility: the secret word has the O at position 2, and the extra O is at position 1, but the word is not common or I'm missing it.

Perhaps ""ROOFS"" but R excluded and ends with FS.

Let's list all 5-letter words ending with ""ST"" and second letter O.

From memory, common ones are ""HOSTS"", ""TOAST"", ""ROAST"", ""COAST"", ""BOAST"", but all have excluded letters or wrong pattern.

""HOSTS"": H O S T S -> position 2:O, position 3:S, position 4:T, position 5:S -> not S at 4 and T at 5.

We need position 4:S and 5:T, so the last two must be ""ST"", not ""TS"".

So words ending with ""ST"".

With second letter O.

So the pattern is: _ O _ S T

And from feedback, position 1 must be O? Because of the extra O.

But let's assume that, and see.

Perhaps the word is ""OOZES"" but ends with ES, not ST.

I think there's a mistake in the feedback interpretation.

Let's re-examine the feedback for ""boost"":

- B(x) : B not in word
- O(✓) : O at position 2 correct
- O(-) : O is in the word but not at position 3
- S(✓) : S at position 4 correct
- T(✓) : T at position 5 correct

The O at position 3 in the guess is not in the correct position, but it is present in the word. Since position 2 is O and correct, the secret word must have at least two O's. The only position for the second O is position 1, because 3,4,5 are not available (3 is not O, 4 and 5 are S and T).

So position 1 must be O.

Therefore, the word is O O ? S T.

Now, for the third letter, it must be a letter that is not O and not excluded.

But what word is that? Perhaps ""OOPST"" is not, but maybe ""OOTHS"" is close but not.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word is ""FOOTS"", but F O O T S -> position 4 is T, not S, and position 5 is S, not T.

Not matching.

Perhaps the feedback for position 4 and 5 in ""moist"" was correct, so it must be S at 4 and T at 5.

Let's list all possible words matching _ O _ S T with no excluded letters.

Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,B

Remaining: D,F,G,H,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Words:
- ""DOUTS"" -> D O U T S? Positions: D, O, U, T, S -> position 4:T, 5:S -> not S at 4 and T at 5.
- ""FOIST"" -> F O I S T, but I excluded.
- ""GOATS"" -> G O A T S, A excluded.
- ""HOTES"" -> H O T E S, E excluded.
- ""JOUST"" -> J O U S T -> positions: J, O, U, S, T -> matches pattern: 1:J, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:T -> and letters: J not excluded, O not, U not, S and T are in. I is not in this word, so not excluded. J is allowed.

""JOUST"" is a word.

In ""JOUST"", how many O's? One O at position 2.

When we guessed ""boost"", which has O at position 2 and position 3.

For ""JOUST"":
- Position 2: O -> matches, so ✓
- Position 3: U -> not O, so the O in the guess at position 3 is not in the secret word? But ""JOUST"" has only one O, at position 2. So the O at position 3 in ""boost"" is not in the secret word, so it should be marked x, not -.

But in feedback, it was marked -, which means it is in the word but wrong position. But if ""JOUST"" has only one O, it should be x for the second O.

Contradiction.

Therefore, ""JOUST"" cannot be the word because it has only one O.

Similarly, ""BOOST"" has two O's, but we guessed it and got B(x) and the second O as (-), which is consistent with ""BOOST"" not being the word because B is not in it, and the second O is present but not at position 3 if the word has O at position 1 and 2.

But for ""BOOST"" to be the word, position 3 would be O, so it should be ✓, not -.

I'm confused.

Let's assume the secret word is ""LOOPS"", but L O O P S -> positions: L, O, O, P, S -> position 4:P, 5:S -> not S at 4 and T at 5.

Not matching.

Another word: ""POOTS"" -> P O O T S -> position 4:T, 5:S -> not.

I think the only way is to accept that position 1 is O, so the word is O O ? S T, and the third letter must be a consonant that can form a word.

Perhaps ""OOH S T"" but not.

Or in English, there is ""OOTU"" etc., but not ending with ST.

Perhaps the word is ""OCTET"" but pattern not match.

I think I have to consider that the feedback might have a mistake, or I missed a word.

Another possibility: the secret word has O at position 2, and the extra O at position 5? But position 5 is T, fixed, so not.

Unless the T is not fixed? But from ""moist"" feedback, T is at position 5 and correct.

Similarly for S at 4.

So no.

Perhaps the feedback for ""moist"" position 5 T is correct, but in the secret word, T is at position 5, so it can't be O.

So I think the only logical conclusion is that position 1 is O, and the word is O O ? S T.

For the third position, it must be a letter that forms a valid word.

Let's think of words like "" oolith"" but that's 6 letters.

""Oocyte"" not 5.

Perhaps ""ootid"" but not common.

Maybe in Wordle, the word list includes less common words.

But let's assume we can use ""OONST"" or something, but it's not valid.

Perhaps the extra O is not at position 1, but the feedback is for the letter, not the position.

Another idea: in ""boost"", the first O is at position 2, correct. The second O is at position 3, and it is marked as present but wrong position. This means that in the secret word, there is an O that is not at position 2 or 3? But position 2 is O, so it is at position 2, and the additional O is elsewhere.

But where? Only position 1.

Perhaps the secret word has O at position 2 and also at position 4 or 5, but position 4 is S, position 5 is T, so not.

Unless S or T is O, but they are fixed.

I think I have to accept that position 1 is O.

So the word is O O ? S T.

For the third letter, let's choose from remaining letters.

Remaining letters: D,F,G,H,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We can guess a word that has O at position 1, O at position 2, and a letter from the remaining at position 3, S at 4, T at 5.

For example, ""OOHST"" – not a word, but let's see if there is any.

Perhaps ""OOPST"" is not, but ""OOZES"" is not.

Another thought: maybe the word is ""FIRST"" but F I R S T, position 2:I excluded, not O.

I think I need to look for words with second letter O and ending with ST.

For example, ""HOSTS"" has second letter O? H O S T S, so position 2:O, but position 3:S, position 4:T, position 5:S, so not S at 4 and T at 5.

Similarly, ""COSTS"" C O S T S, position 2:O, 3:S, 4:T, 5:S.

Not.

""DUSTS"" D U S T S, position 2:U, not O.

Only ""JOUST"" and ""BOOST"" have position 2:O and ending with ST? ""JOUST"" is J O U S T, position 4:S, 5:T.

""BOOST"" is B O O S T, position 4:S, 5:T.

But ""BOOST"" we already guessed, and it's not the word because B is not in it, and the second O is not at position 3.

For ""JOUST"", it has only one O, so the second O in ""boost"" should not be present, but feedback says it is present.

So the secret word must have two O's.

Therefore, it must be a word with two O's, position 2 is O, and the other O at position 1, and positions 4 and 5 are S and T.

So O O ? S T.

Perhaps the word is ""OOTHE"" but E excluded.

Or ""OONCE"" not.

I think I have to consider that the third letter is H, for ""OOHED"" not.

Perhaps ""OOTUS"" not.

I recall that in Wordle, there is a word ""OOTID"" but it's not common, and ends with ID.

Another idea: perhaps the feedback for position 3 in ""boost"" is (-) because the secret word has O at position 1, and when we guessed ""boost"", the O at position 3 is the same O as position 1? But in Wordle, if there is only one O, and it is at position 1, then the O at position 3 should be marked x, because the O is already accounted for at position 2? No, in Wordle, feedback is per letter in the guess, not per letter in the word.

Let's recall Wordle rules: if a letter is in the word but not in the correct position, it gets a yellow (-). If a letter is in the word and in correct position, green (✓). If not in the word, gray (x).

For repeated letters, it's a bit tricky. If the guess has a repeated letter, and the word has fewer instances, then the extras are marked gray.

For example, if the word has one O, and you guess a word with two O's, the first O might be green or yellow, and the second O will be gray if there's only one.

In this case, for ""boost"" guess:
- If the secret word has only one O at position 2, then:
  - Position 2: O -> green (✓)
  - Position 3: O -> gray (x) because there's only one O, and it's already used.
- If the secret word has two O's, say at positions 1 and 2, then:
  - Position 2: O -> green (✓)
  - Position 3: O -> yellow (-) if position 3 is not O, but there is another O at position 1.

In the feedback, position 3 is yellow (-), so it means the secret word has at least two O's, and the O at position 3 in the guess is one of the extra O's not at position 3.

Since position 2 is green, the second O must be at position 1.

Therefore, the secret word has O at position 1 and position 2.

So the pattern is O O ? S T.

Now, for the third position, it must be a letter that is not O, and not excluded.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,B

Remaining: D,F,G,H,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We need to guess a word that fits O O ? S T.

Since there are few possibilities, we can guess with a word that uses a common letter for position 3.

For example, ""FO O H S T"" not a word.

""GO O H S T"" not.

""HO O H S T"" not.

""LO O H S T"" not.

""PO O H S T"" not.

""U"" is vowel, ""OOUS T"" not.

Perhaps ""OOZES"" is the closest, but ends with ES.

I think for the sake of the game, we might have to guess ""OOHED"" but E excluded.

Perhaps the word is ""OOTUS"" but ends with US.

I found a word: ""OOPST"" is not, but ""OPSET"" not.

Another: ""OONST"" is not, but ""OONTS"" is a word? O O N T S, but N is excluded, and position 4:T, 5:S, not ST.

Not matching.

Perhaps ""OOTHS"" is O O T H S, position 4:H, 5:S, not.

I think I have to give up and guess a word that fits the pattern with a letter that might work.

For example, ""OOH S T"" but not, so let's use ""DO O S T"" but ""doost"" not a word.

Perhaps ""GHOST"" but position 2 is H.

I think there's a mistake; perhaps the feedback for ""moist"" position 4 and 5 is not both correct? But it is.

Let's double-check the feedback.

Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(✓)

So S at position 4 is correct, T at position 5 is correct.

Guess 3: boost -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) O(-) S(✓) T(✓)

So for position 3, O is present but not at position 3.

Therefore, the only possibility is position 1 is O.

So the word is O O ? S T.

For the third letter, let's choose H, for ""OOHED"" not, or K for ""OOKST"" not.

Perhaps ""OOLST"" for ""oolite"" but not.

I recall that ""OOPECK"" not.

Perhaps in this context, we can use ""OUGHT"" but not ending with ST.

I think I need to choose a guess that has O at position 1, a new letter at position 3, and S and T at 4 and 5.

For example, ""OODS T"" not.

Or ""OOT"" not.

Perhaps the word is ""ROOTS"" but R excluded and ends with TS.

I think for the next guess, we should guess ""OOZES"" even though it ends with ES, but it doesn't match the pattern.

Perhaps the pattern is wrong.

Another idea: perhaps the S and T are not at position 4 and 5 for the secret word? But the feedback says they are correct position.

Let's assume the feedback is correct.

Perhaps the secret word has the O at position 2, and the extra O at position 4, but position 4 is S, so not.

I think I have to make a guess.

Let's guess ""JOUST"" to test.

If we guess ""JOUST"":
- Position 1: J
- Position 2: O (correct)
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: S (correct)
- Position 5: T (correct)

If the secret word has only one O, then U at position 3 might be correct or not.

But from feedback, we know there is another O, so if ""JOUST"" has only one O, it won't have the extra O, so the feedback for ""JOUST"" will show that there is no second O.

Similarly, if we guess ""LOOPS"", but position 4 is P, not S.

Not.

Perhaps ""POOTS"" P O O T S, position 4:T, 5:S, not S at 4.

I think the only way is to guess a word with O at position 1.

So let's guess ""OOhed"" but not 5 letters with ST.

Perhaps ""OOTHE"" is not.

I found a word: ""OUNCE"" but E excluded and not ST.

I think for the next guess, we can guess ""DOUBT"" but not ST.

Let's ignore the pattern for a moment and guess a word that has O at position 1, and other letters.

For example, ""OUPHE"" not.

Perhaps ""ADIEU"" but letters excluded.

I think I need to choose ""JOUST"" as a guess to test the O.

So I'll guess ""JOUST"".

But let's see the response format.

Perhaps the word is ""FOCUS"" but not.

I give up; let's guess ""JOUST"".

<guess>joust</guess>After reviewing the feedback from previous guesses, the following is known:

- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E (from Guess 1), M, I (from Guess 2), and B (from Guess 3). These letters cannot be in the secret word.
- **Correct positions**: 
  - Position 2: O (from Guess 2 and confirmed in Guess 3).
  - Position 4: S (from Guess 2 and confirmed in Guess 3).
  - Position 5: T (from Guess 2 and confirmed in Guess 3).
- **Additional information from Guess 3 (""boost"")**: 
  - The second O (at position 3) is marked as present but in the wrong position (-), indicating the secret word contains at least two O's. Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed as S and T, and position 2 is O, the only possible location for the second O is position 1. Thus, the secret word must start with O, resulting in the pattern: **O O _ S T**.
- **Remaining letters**: The valid letters for position 3 are from the set not excluded: D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Given the pattern O O _ S T, the secret word must be a valid English word. However, common words like ""boost"" (already guessed) and ""joist"" (contains excluded I) are invalid. ""Joust"" is a possible word that fits the pattern with U in position 3, but it has only one O, which conflicts with the feedback requiring two O's. Other combinations like ""oohst"" or ""oogst"" are not valid words. 

After considering all possibilities, ""joust"" is chosen as the next guess to test the presence of the second O and the letter U. If ""joust"" is incorrect, the feedback will provide clarity on the status of U and the O count, narrowing down the options for the next guess.",Guess 4: joust -> FEEDBACK: J(✓) O(✓) U(✓) S(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
