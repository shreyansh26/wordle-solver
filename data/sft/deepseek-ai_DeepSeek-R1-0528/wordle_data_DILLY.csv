We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Since none of these letters are in the word, we need to choose a new word that uses different letters.
 We should avoid using C, R, A, N, E.

 Now, we must select a word from the remaining letters of the alphabet. We want to test other common letters.

 Common English letters that we haven't tested yet: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, Y, W, F, K, V, J, Q, X, Z.

 We want to maximize information, so we should choose a word with common letters that we haven't used yet.
 Let's consider common vowels: O, I, U (we have no vowels in the word so far, but note that we've already eliminated A and E).
 Also common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

 A good starting word might be ""SLOTH"" but that has O and H which are less common? Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" but U is not very common.

 Alternatively, we can use a word like ""SPILT"": S, P, I, L, T.

 But let me think of a word that uses letters that are frequent and haven't been tried.

 Let me list the top frequent letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... (but we have eliminated E, A, R).

 So from the top, T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U are still available.

 We can choose a word that has several of these.

 Possible words:
   ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S
   ""SOLID"": S, O, L, I, D

 However, note that we have 6 tries and we want to get as much information as possible.

 Another idea: since we know the word doesn't have C, R, A, N, E, we can pick a word that uses common letters we haven't tried.

 Let's pick ""TOILS"": 
   T, O, I, L, S

 But we can also consider words that might have more common letters. How about ""HOIST""? H, O, I, S, T.

 But note that H is less common than some others.

 Another good one is ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T.

 However, M is also not as common as S or T.

 Alternatively, ""SLIMY"": S, L, I, M, Y. But Y might be a vowel too.

 Since we've already eliminated 5 letters, we have plenty of options.

 I think ""TOILS"" is a reasonable choice. But let me see if there's a word that uses more frequent letters.

 According to letter frequency, T is the most common of the remaining, then O, I, S, L, etc.

 We can try ""TULIP"": T, U, L, I, P. But U is less common.

 How about ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T.

 This has S, P, L, I, T. P is somewhat common.

 Another common starting word is ""SHINE"", but E is eliminated so we can't use that.

 Since E and A are eliminated, we have to avoid them.

 I think a good word would be ""MOIST"" or ""GHOUL"", but that has G and H which might be infrequent.

 After considering: Let's choose ""SPILT"" (or ""SPLIT"", both are valid) to test S, P, I, L, T.

 But note: ""SPLIT"" is a valid word. It has S, P, L, I, T.

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" has P, O, I, N, T -> but N was eliminated (from the feedback, N was not present). So we cannot use ""POINT"" because N is eliminated.

 Similarly, we must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 So the word must not include any of these.

 Therefore, ""SPLIT"" is acceptable because it has S, P, L, I, T - none of C,R,A,N,E.

 However, note that in the first guess ""crane"", we got that R is not in the word. So we must avoid R? Actually, R is already eliminated.

 Also, we can use ""STOMP"", but O and M? Let me check: 
   ""STOMP"" has S, T, O, M, P.

 But I think ""SPLIT"" is a good choice because it has common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SHIFT"". It has S, H, I, F, T.

 We want to maximize vowels? We haven't tested O, U, I. In ""SPLIT"", we have I (a vowel) and S, P, L, T (consonants).

 We also haven't tested U or O. Maybe we should test O because it's a common vowel.

 Since A and E are gone, O and I are the most common vowels left. And U is less common.

 So including both O and I might be good? But we can do that in the next guess if needed.

 Considering the above, I propose we choose a word that includes O and I, and avoids the eliminated letters.

 How about ""OUIJA""? That has O, U, I, J, A -> but A is eliminated, so invalid.

 ""AUDIO"" has A and we can't use that.

 So we need a word without A, E.

 How about ""MUSIC"": M, U, S, I, C -> C is eliminated (from feedback: C was marked 'x'), so invalid.

 ""SOLID"": S, O, L, I, D -> acceptable? S, O, L, I, D: none of C,R,A,N,E. So OK.

 ""SOLID"" uses S, O, L, I, D.

 Another one: ""FOIST"": F, O, I, S, T -> acceptable.

 But F is less common.

 Alternatively, ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> N is eliminated, so invalid.

 After reevaluating, I think ""SOLID"" is good: S, O, L, I, D.

 We can also consider ""BUILD"", but B is not very common and we haven't tested B yet? Actually, we haven't tested B, but we might test later.

 Since we want to get vowels tested, O is in ""SOLID"".

 So I choose ""SOLID"".

 However, we have not tested T yet, which is a very common letter. In ""SPLIT"" we would have tested T as well.

 So if we use ""SOLID"", then we don't test T. But we can test T in the next guess if needed.

 Alternatively, if we use ""TOILS"", then we get T, O, I, L, S.

 ""TOILS"" is acceptable: no C,R,A,N,E.

 And it has T and the common vowels O, I.

 So I think ""TOILS"" might be better than ""SOLID"" because T is more common than D.

 Therefore, I'll choose ""TOILS"".

 But note: ""TOILS"" has T, O, I, L, S.

 We haven't used any of these letters.

 So: <guess>toils</guess>

 However, let me confirm that ""TOILS"" is a valid English word? Yes, it means hard work.

 We are going to use this as our second guess.

 But there's also ""TILES"", but we don't have E, so we must avoid E.

 So ""TOILS"" is valid.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""TOILS"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"", all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as ""x"", meaning they are **not in the secret word**. Therefore, the new guess must avoid these letters entirely.

- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E  
- To maximize information, prioritize new common letters from the remaining alphabet (e.g., S, T, L, O, I).  
- Selected ""TOILS"" because it:  
  - Uses untested high-frequency letters (T, O, I, S, L).  
  - Contains common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, S, L).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and ensures broad coverage for clues.

 Another one: ""FOIST"": F, O, I, S, T -> acceptable.

 But F is less common.

 Alternatively, ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> N is eliminated, so invalid.

 After reevaluating, I think ""SOLID"" is good: S, O, L, I, D.

 We can also consider ""BUILD"", but B is not very common and we haven't tested B yet? Actually, we haven't tested B, but we might test later.

 Since we want to get vowels tested, O is in ""SOLID"".

 So I choose ""SOLID"".

 However, we have not tested T yet, which is a very common letter. In ""SPLIT"" we would have tested T as well.

 So if we use ""SOLID"", then we don't test T. But we can test T in the next guess if needed.

 Alternatively, if we use ""TOILS"", then we get T, O, I, L, S.

 ""TOILS"" is acceptable: no C,R,A,N,E.

 And it has T and the common vowels O, I.

 So I think ""TOILS"" might be better than ""SOLID"" because T is more common than D.

 Therefore, I'll choose ""TOILS"".

 But note: ""TOILS"" has T, O, I, L, S.

 We haven't used any of these letters.

 So: <guess>toils</guess>

 However, let me confirm that ""TOILS"" is a valid English word? Yes, it means hard work.

 We are going to use this as our second guess.

 But there's also ""TILES"", but we don't have E, so we must avoid E.

 So ""TOILS"" is valid.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""TOILS"".Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"", all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as ""x"", meaning they are **not in the secret word**. Therefore, the new guess must avoid these letters entirely.

- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E  
- To maximize information, prioritize new common letters from the remaining alphabet (e.g., S, T, L, O, I).  
- Selected ""TOILS"" because it:  
  - Uses untested high-frequency letters (T, O, I, S, L).  
  - Contains common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, S, L).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and ensures broad coverage for clues.

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:
1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as 'x' (not in the word).
2. ""toils"": 
   - T: x (not in the word)
   - O: x (not in the word)
   - I: - (in the word but wrong position)
   - L: ✓ (correct position, so L is the 4th letter)
   - S: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter 'I', but not in the 3rd position (since in ""toils"" it was the 3rd letter and marked as wrong position).
- The letter 'L' is in the 4th position (so the 4th letter of the secret word is L).
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S. (We must avoid these in future guesses.)

Additionally, from the first guess, we already eliminated C, R, A, N, E, and now we add T, O, S to the eliminated list.

So eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S.

The secret word has:
- The 4th letter is L.
- It contains the letter I, but not in the 3rd position.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain any of the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S.
- Must include the letter I (since we know it's in the word, but not in the 3rd position).
- Must have L as the 4th letter.

So the word pattern is: _ _ _ L _

And the word must contain I, but not in the 3rd position. So I can be in position 1, 2, or 5.

Now, we need to think of words that fit this pattern and use the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information by testing new common letters. Common letters from the remaining: H, D, U, M, P, G, B, F, Y, etc.

We also know that the word must have an I in either position 1, 2, or 5.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: I in the first position: I _ _ L _
Option 2: I in the second position: _ I _ L _
Option 3: I in the fifth position: _ _ _ L I

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Consider common letters: H, D, U, M, P, G, B, F, Y.

Let's try to think of words:

- For pattern _ _ _ L I: 
  - We need three letters for the first three positions. Examples: 
    - ""JULY"" is 4 letters, not 5.
    - ""MULCH"" has C and H? But C is eliminated. 
    - ""GULCH"" has C -> invalid.
  - How about ""BUHLI""? Not a word.
  - ""DAILY"" has A (eliminated) -> invalid.
  - ""HAULI""? Not a word.

  This pattern might be hard.

- For pattern _ I _ L _: 
  - The second letter is I, and the fourth is L. So: _ I _ L _
  - Examples: 
    - ""BILLY"": B I L L Y -> but the third letter is L, but we already have L in the fourth? And we have two L's? But we don't know if the word has two L's. Also, the third letter would be L, but then the fourth is also L? That might be possible, but let's see the feedback: in ""toils"", we had L in the fourth and it was correct, but we don't know about other positions. However, the feedback for ""toils"" didn't show a second L, but that doesn't mean there isn't one. But in ""toils"", the L was in the fourth and correct, and the other letters were not L. So if the word had two L's, then in ""toils"" we would have only one L (in the correct position) and the other L might be in a different position and not guessed? Actually, in ""toils"" we only have one L. So if the secret word has two L's, then when we guessed ""toils"", the L in the fourth would be correct, and the other L would be in a position we didn't guess, so it wouldn't show. But we don't know if there is a second L. So we can't rule it out.

  But let's stick to words we know. 
  - ""DILLY"": D I L L Y -> but then the third letter is L, which would be the same as the fourth? And we have two L's. Also, the pattern would be: second letter I, third letter L, fourth letter L? That doesn't work because the fourth letter is L, but the third is also L? Then the word would be _ I L L _. But in our pattern, the fourth is L, so the third can be something else. Actually, in ""DILLY"", the third letter is L and the fourth is L? No: D-I-L-L-Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y. So the fourth letter is L, which matches, but we also have L in the third. But we don't know if that's allowed. However, we must avoid eliminated letters. D, I, L, Y are not eliminated? D is not eliminated, I is allowed, L is in the word, Y is not eliminated. But we have two L's? The feedback from ""toils"" only showed one L (in the fourth) and the I was present but not in the third. It didn't show a second L because we didn't guess a second L. So it's possible.

  But let's see if ""DILLY"" is valid? It is a word, meaning something that is silly or foolish.

  However, we are not sure about double letters. We should avoid assuming double letters for now because we don't have evidence.

- Another word: ""KILLY""? Not a word.

- ""HILLY"": H I L L Y -> same as above.

- ""WILLY"": W I L L Y -> same.

- ""PILLY"": P I L L Y -> same.

But these all have double L. We don't know if the word has double L. We might be able to test without double letters.

- Without double L: 
  - Pattern: _ I _ L _
  - We need a letter for first, third, and fifth.

  Examples:
    - ""BIGLY"": B I G L Y -> valid? It means in a big manner? It's an adverb. But it's accepted in Wordle.
    - ""DIMLY"": D I M L Y -> valid, meaning faintly or obscurely.
    - ""DIPLY"": Not a word.
    - ""FILLY"": F I L L Y -> double L.

  So ""BIGLY"" and ""DIMLY"" are options.

- Pattern with I in the first position: I _ _ L _
  - Examples: 
    - ""IDLY"": too short.
    - ""IDYLL"": 5 letters? I-D-Y-L-L -> but that's 5 letters, but has double L and Y. Also, the fourth letter is L, which is correct, but the fifth is L? Then the word is I D Y L L? Actually, ""IDYLL"" is I-D-Y-L-L, so positions: 1:I, 2:D, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:L. So again double L.
    - ""ITCHY"": I T C H Y -> but T and C are eliminated -> invalid.
    - ""IMPEL"": I M P E L -> E is eliminated -> invalid.
    - ""INPUT"": I N P U T -> N and T eliminated -> invalid.

  Hard to find without eliminated letters.

- Pattern with I in the fifth position: _ _ _ L I
  - Examples:
    - ""MULCHI"": not a word.
    - ""JULI"" is 4 letters.
    - ""BULGY"": B U L G Y -> but the fourth letter is G? We need L in the fourth. So this is B U L G Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:G, 5:Y -> but we need the fourth to be L, so that doesn't work.
    - We need the fourth letter to be L, so the word must end with ""LI"". 
    - So pattern: _ _ _ L I
    - Examples: 
        - ""AALII"": has A (eliminated) -> invalid.
        - ""KULFI"": K U L F I -> positions: 1:K, 2:U, 3:L, 4:F, 5:I -> but the fourth letter is F, not L. We need the fourth to be L? No, the pattern is _ _ _ L I, so the fourth is L and the fifth is I. So the third letter is the one before L. So the word is: letter1, letter2, letter3, L, I.
        - ""BALTI"": has A -> invalid.
        - ""DELHI"": D E L H I -> E is eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""FOLKI"": F O L K I -> O is eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""GULFI"": G U L F I -> same as above, fourth letter is F? No: G(1), U(2), L(3), F(4), I(5). But we need the fourth to be L? That would require the third to be something and the fourth L. So if the word ends with ""LI"", then the L is the fourth? Actually, in a 5-letter word, if it ends with ""LI"", then the fourth letter is L and the fifth is I. So the word is: ? ? ? L I. The third letter is the one at position 3.

        So for example, ""HULKI"" -> H U L K I -> positions: 1:H, 2:U, 3:L, 4:K, 5:I -> but then the fourth letter is K, not L. We need the fourth letter to be L, so the third letter must be the one that comes before the L? Actually, no: the fourth letter is the L. So the word should be: [1] [2] [3] L I. So the third letter is at position 3, and the fourth is L at position 4.

        Example: ""PULI"" is 4 letters. 
        ""PULIK"" is not a word.

        How about ""XYLYL""? But that has X and Y, and it's not common. Also, it has two L's and two Y's.

        This pattern is difficult.

Given the above, it seems the pattern with I in the second position is more promising. We have words like ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"".

But note: in ""DIMLY"", the letters are D, I, M, L, Y. 
- We haven't eliminated D, M, Y. 
- The word has I in the second position and L in the fourth.

Similarly, ""BIGLY"" has B, I, G, L, Y.

We also have ""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y -> but then the fourth letter is P, not L. So that doesn't fit.

Another one: ""JIGLY"": J, I, G, L, Y -> valid? It means jiggly. But we have L in the fourth? J(1), I(2), G(3), L(4), Y(5). Yes, that fits.

But J is not very common.

Alternatively, ""HILLY"" has double L, but we can consider it.

But let's avoid double letters for now to get more information.

So between ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"", which one to choose?

We can also consider ""DIVLY""? Not a word.

""PIGLY""? Not a word.

""FIGLY""? Not a word.

So ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"" are candidates.

We can also consider ""BIDDY"" but that has D and Y, and the pattern: B I D D Y -> no L in the fourth? Doesn't fit.

Another word: ""MILKY"" -> M I L K Y -> but then the third letter is L, so the fourth would be K? We need the fourth to be L. So that doesn't work.

So back to ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"".

We can also consider ""WILDLY"" is 6 letters.

Or ""GIDDY"" has no L.

So let's choose between ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"".

We want to test more common letters. The letters in ""DIMLY"": D, I, M, L, Y. 
The letters in ""BIGLY"": B, I, G, L, Y.

Common letters: D is more common than B? According to English letter frequency, D is more common than B and G. But we are testing M in ""DIMLY"" and G in ""BIGLY"". M is more common than G.

But we are also testing Y in both.

Alternatively, we can test a word that has U or H, which are common.

But in the pattern _ I _ L _, we can try:

""LIGHT"" has T (eliminated) -> invalid.

""PILED"" has E -> invalid.

""GUILD"": G U I L D -> but the fourth letter is D? We need the fourth to be L. So the word is G U I L D -> positions: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D. So the fourth is L, which is correct, and the third is I? But we know that I is in the word but not in the third position (from the feedback of ""toils""). In ""toils"", I was in the third position and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has an I, but not in the third position. However, in ""GUILD"", we are putting I in the third position. But the feedback said that I is not in the third position, so we cannot put I in the third position in any guess? 

Wait, no: the feedback for ""toils"" was that I is in the word but not in the third position. So the secret word has an I, but it is not at position 3. Therefore, in our new guess, we must not put I in the third position. So for the pattern _ I _ L _, we are putting I in the second position, which is allowed. But if we try a word that has I in the third position, that would be invalid because we know I is not in the third position.

So in ""GUILD"", if we put I in the third position, that would be incorrect because we know the secret word does not have I in the third position. Therefore, we cannot use ""GUILD"" because it has I in the third position.

Similarly, any word that has I in the third position is invalid.

Therefore, for the pattern, we can only have I in the first, second, or fifth position. But in the pattern _ I _ L _, we are putting I in the second position, which is okay.

So ""GUILD"" is invalid because it has I in the third.

Now, back to ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"": both have I in the second position, which is allowed.

We can also consider ""HILLY"", but it has double L. But let's see: ""HILLY"" has I in the second and L in the fourth, but also L in the third. The third letter is L. We don't know if the word has an L in the third? But we know the fourth is L, and we don't have information about other positions. However, we are allowed to have L in the third? The feedback from ""toils"" only told us that the fourth letter is L and that I is not in the third. It didn't say anything about L in the third. So it's possible.

But if we use ""HILLY"", we are testing the same L twice? We already know the fourth is L, so if we put L in the third, we might get feedback on that. But we are trying to get more information, so testing a double L might be good? Or it might be wasteful? Since we have limited guesses.

Alternatively, we can avoid double letters to test more new letters.

So I think ""DIMLY"" is a good choice because it tests D, M, Y, and we already know I and L.

Similarly, ""BIGLY"" tests B, G, Y.

Now, which one? Let's look at letter frequency to maximize the chance of hitting a letter.

Remaining common letters: H, D, U, M, P, G, B, F, Y, K, etc.

D is more common than B, and M is more common than G. So ""DIMLY"" tests D and M, which are more common than B and G.

Therefore, I choose ""DIMLY"".

But note: in ""DIMLY"", the fifth letter is Y. We don't know if Y is in the word. But we are testing it.

So our guess: D I M L Y

But let me confirm the pattern: 
Position 1: D
Position 2: I
Position 3: M
Position 4: L (correct, we know)
Position 5: Y

We are testing I in the second position, which is allowed because the feedback only said I is not in the third.

So we'll go with ""DIMLY"".

But is ""DIMLY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning in a dim manner.

Therefore, our next guess is ""DIMLY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (`x`), so they are eliminated.
- **Guess 2: ""toils""** → 
  - T and O are absent (`x`), so they are eliminated.
  - I is present but in the wrong position (`-`), so I is in the secret word but not in position 3.
  - L is correct and in position 4 (`✓`), so the 4th letter of the secret word is **L**.
  - S is absent (`x`), so it is eliminated.

- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S (cannot be used).
- **Confirmed positions**: The 4th letter is **L**.
- **Confirmed presence**: **I** is in the word but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5).
- **Pattern**: `_ _ _ L _` (with I in position 1, 2, or 5).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Avoid all eliminated letters.
- Ensure **L** is in position 4.
- Include **I** in position 1, 2, or 5 (since it can't be in position 3).
- Test new high-frequency letters from the remaining alphabet (e.g., D, M, Y, B, G, H, U) to maximize information.
- Prioritize words without double letters to cover more ground.

### Selected Guess: ""DIMLY""
- **Why ""DIMLY""?**
  - Fits the pattern: `D I M L Y` (positions: 1=D, 2=I, 3=M, 4=L, 5=Y).
  - Tests **I** in position 2 (allowed, since I isn't in position 3).
  - Tests new common letters: **D** (high frequency), **M** (common), and **Y** (common vowel substitute).
  - Avoids eliminated letters and double letters.
  - Valid English word (meaning ""faintly or obscurely"").

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities by testing key letters while adhering to constraints.

<guess>dimly</guess>",dimly,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:
1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as 'x' (not in the word).
2. ""toils"": 
   - T: x (not in the word)
   - O: x (not in the word)
   - I: - (in the word but wrong position)
   - L: ✓ (correct position, so L is the 4th letter)
   - S: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter 'I', but not in the 3rd position (since in ""toils"" it was the 3rd letter and marked as wrong position).
- The letter 'L' is in the 4th position (so the 4th letter of the secret word is L).
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S. (We must avoid these in future guesses.)

Additionally, from the first guess, we already eliminated C, R, A, N, E, and now we add T, O, S to the eliminated list.

So eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S.

The secret word has:
- The 4th letter is L.
- It contains the letter I, but not in the 3rd position.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain any of the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S.
- Must include the letter I (since we know it's in the word, but not in the 3rd position).
- Must have L as the 4th letter.

So the word pattern is: _ _ _ L _

And the word must contain I, but not in the 3rd position. So I can be in position 1, 2, or 5.

Now, we need to think of words that fit this pattern and use the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information by testing new common letters. Common letters from the remaining: H, D, U, M, P, G, B, F, Y, etc.

We also know that the word must have an I in either position 1, 2, or 5.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: I in the first position: I _ _ L _
Option 2: I in the second position: _ I _ L _
Option 3: I in the fifth position: _ _ _ L I

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Consider common letters: H, D, U, M, P, G, B, F, Y.

Let's try to think of words:

- For pattern _ _ _ L I: 
  - We need three letters for the first three positions. Examples: 
    - ""JULY"" is 4 letters, not 5.
    - ""MULCH"" has C and H? But C is eliminated. 
    - ""GULCH"" has C -> invalid.
  - How about ""BUHLI""? Not a word.
  - ""DAILY"" has A (eliminated) -> invalid.
  - ""HAULI""? Not a word.

  This pattern might be hard.

- For pattern _ I _ L _: 
  - The second letter is I, and the fourth is L. So: _ I _ L _
  - Examples: 
    - ""BILLY"": B I L L Y -> but the third letter is L, but we already have L in the fourth? And we have two L's? But we don't know if the word has two L's. Also, the third letter would be L, but then the fourth is also L? That might be possible, but let's see the feedback: in ""toils"", we had L in the fourth and it was correct, but we don't know about other positions. However, the feedback for ""toils"" didn't show a second L, but that doesn't mean there isn't one. But in ""toils"", the L was in the fourth and correct, and the other letters were not L. So if the word had two L's, then in ""toils"" we would have only one L (in the correct position) and the other L might be in a different position and not guessed? Actually, in ""toils"" we only have one L. So if the secret word has two L's, then when we guessed ""toils"", the L in the fourth would be correct, and the other L would be in a position we didn't guess, so it wouldn't show. But we don't know if there is a second L. So we can't rule it out.

  But let's stick to words we know. 
  - ""DILLY"": D I L L Y -> but then the third letter is L, which would be the same as the fourth? And we have two L's. Also, the pattern would be: second letter I, third letter L, fourth letter L? That doesn't work because the fourth letter is L, but the third is also L? Then the word would be _ I L L _. But in our pattern, the fourth is L, so the third can be something else. Actually, in ""DILLY"", the third letter is L and the fourth is L? No: D-I-L-L-Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y. So the fourth letter is L, which matches, but we also have L in the third. But we don't know if that's allowed. However, we must avoid eliminated letters. D, I, L, Y are not eliminated? D is not eliminated, I is allowed, L is in the word, Y is not eliminated. But we have two L's? The feedback from ""toils"" only showed one L (in the fourth) and the I was present but not in the third. It didn't show a second L because we didn't guess a second L. So it's possible.

  But let's see if ""DILLY"" is valid? It is a word, meaning something that is silly or foolish.

  However, we are not sure about double letters. We should avoid assuming double letters for now because we don't have evidence.

- Another word: ""KILLY""? Not a word.

- ""HILLY"": H I L L Y -> same as above.

- ""WILLY"": W I L L Y -> same.

- ""PILLY"": P I L L Y -> same.

But these all have double L. We don't know if the word has double L. We might be able to test without double letters.

- Without double L: 
  - Pattern: _ I _ L _
  - We need a letter for first, third, and fifth.

  Examples:
    - ""BIGLY"": B I G L Y -> valid? It means in a big manner? It's an adverb. But it's accepted in Wordle.
    - ""DIMLY"": D I M L Y -> valid, meaning faintly or obscurely.
    - ""DIPLY"": Not a word.
    - ""FILLY"": F I L L Y -> double L.

  So ""BIGLY"" and ""DIMLY"" are options.

- Pattern with I in the first position: I _ _ L _
  - Examples: 
    - ""IDLY"": too short.
    - ""IDYLL"": 5 letters? I-D-Y-L-L -> but that's 5 letters, but has double L and Y. Also, the fourth letter is L, which is correct, but the fifth is L? Then the word is I D Y L L? Actually, ""IDYLL"" is I-D-Y-L-L, so positions: 1:I, 2:D, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:L. So again double L.
    - ""ITCHY"": I T C H Y -> but T and C are eliminated -> invalid.
    - ""IMPEL"": I M P E L -> E is eliminated -> invalid.
    - ""INPUT"": I N P U T -> N and T eliminated -> invalid.

  Hard to find without eliminated letters.

- Pattern with I in the fifth position: _ _ _ L I
  - Examples:
    - ""MULCHI"": not a word.
    - ""JULI"" is 4 letters.
    - ""BULGY"": B U L G Y -> but the fourth letter is G? We need L in the fourth. So this is B U L G Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:G, 5:Y -> but we need the fourth to be L, so that doesn't work.
    - We need the fourth letter to be L, so the word must end with ""LI"". 
    - So pattern: _ _ _ L I
    - Examples: 
        - ""AALII"": has A (eliminated) -> invalid.
        - ""KULFI"": K U L F I -> positions: 1:K, 2:U, 3:L, 4:F, 5:I -> but the fourth letter is F, not L. We need the fourth to be L? No, the pattern is _ _ _ L I, so the fourth is L and the fifth is I. So the third letter is the one before L. So the word is: letter1, letter2, letter3, L, I.
        - ""BALTI"": has A -> invalid.
        - ""DELHI"": D E L H I -> E is eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""FOLKI"": F O L K I -> O is eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""GULFI"": G U L F I -> same as above, fourth letter is F? No: G(1), U(2), L(3), F(4), I(5). But we need the fourth to be L? That would require the third to be something and the fourth L. So if the word ends with ""LI"", then the L is the fourth? Actually, in a 5-letter word, if it ends with ""LI"", then the fourth letter is L and the fifth is I. So the word is: ? ? ? L I. The third letter is the one at position 3.

        So for example, ""HULKI"" -> H U L K I -> positions: 1:H, 2:U, 3:L, 4:K, 5:I -> but then the fourth letter is K, not L. We need the fourth letter to be L, so the third letter must be the one that comes before the L? Actually, no: the fourth letter is the L. So the word should be: [1] [2] [3] L I. So the third letter is at position 3, and the fourth is L at position 4.

        Example: ""PULI"" is 4 letters. 
        ""PULIK"" is not a word.

        How about ""XYLYL""? But that has X and Y, and it's not common. Also, it has two L's and two Y's.

        This pattern is difficult.

Given the above, it seems the pattern with I in the second position is more promising. We have words like ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"".

But note: in ""DIMLY"", the letters are D, I, M, L, Y. 
- We haven't eliminated D, M, Y. 
- The word has I in the second position and L in the fourth.

Similarly, ""BIGLY"" has B, I, G, L, Y.

We also have ""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y -> but then the fourth letter is P, not L. So that doesn't fit.

Another one: ""JIGLY"": J, I, G, L, Y -> valid? It means jiggly. But we have L in the fourth? J(1), I(2), G(3), L(4), Y(5). Yes, that fits.

But J is not very common.

Alternatively, ""HILLY"" has double L, but we can consider it.

But let's avoid double letters for now to get more information.

So between ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"", which one to choose?

We can also consider ""DIVLY""? Not a word.

""PIGLY""? Not a word.

""FIGLY""? Not a word.

So ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"" are candidates.

We can also consider ""BIDDY"" but that has D and Y, and the pattern: B I D D Y -> no L in the fourth? Doesn't fit.

Another word: ""MILKY"" -> M I L K Y -> but then the third letter is L, so the fourth would be K? We need the fourth to be L. So that doesn't work.

So back to ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"".

We can also consider ""WILDLY"" is 6 letters.

Or ""GIDDY"" has no L.

So let's choose between ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"".

We want to test more common letters. The letters in ""DIMLY"": D, I, M, L, Y. 
The letters in ""BIGLY"": B, I, G, L, Y.

Common letters: D is more common than B? According to English letter frequency, D is more common than B and G. But we are testing M in ""DIMLY"" and G in ""BIGLY"". M is more common than G.

But we are also testing Y in both.

Alternatively, we can test a word that has U or H, which are common.

But in the pattern _ I _ L _, we can try:

""LIGHT"" has T (eliminated) -> invalid.

""PILED"" has E -> invalid.

""GUILD"": G U I L D -> but the fourth letter is D? We need the fourth to be L. So the word is G U I L D -> positions: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D. So the fourth is L, which is correct, and the third is I? But we know that I is in the word but not in the third position (from the feedback of ""toils""). In ""toils"", I was in the third position and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has an I, but not in the third position. However, in ""GUILD"", we are putting I in the third position. But the feedback said that I is not in the third position, so we cannot put I in the third position in any guess? 

Wait, no: the feedback for ""toils"" was that I is in the word but not in the third position. So the secret word has an I, but it is not at position 3. Therefore, in our new guess, we must not put I in the third position. So for the pattern _ I _ L _, we are putting I in the second position, which is allowed. But if we try a word that has I in the third position, that would be invalid because we know I is not in the third position.

So in ""GUILD"", if we put I in the third position, that would be incorrect because we know the secret word does not have I in the third position. Therefore, we cannot use ""GUILD"" because it has I in the third position.

Similarly, any word that has I in the third position is invalid.

Therefore, for the pattern, we can only have I in the first, second, or fifth position. But in the pattern _ I _ L _, we are putting I in the second position, which is okay.

So ""GUILD"" is invalid because it has I in the third.

Now, back to ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"": both have I in the second position, which is allowed.

We can also consider ""HILLY"", but it has double L. But let's see: ""HILLY"" has I in the second and L in the fourth, but also L in the third. The third letter is L. We don't know if the word has an L in the third? But we know the fourth is L, and we don't have information about other positions. However, we are allowed to have L in the third? The feedback from ""toils"" only told us that the fourth letter is L and that I is not in the third. It didn't say anything about L in the third. So it's possible.

But if we use ""HILLY"", we are testing the same L twice? We already know the fourth is L, so if we put L in the third, we might get feedback on that. But we are trying to get more information, so testing a double L might be good? Or it might be wasteful? Since we have limited guesses.

Alternatively, we can avoid double letters to test more new letters.

So I think ""DIMLY"" is a good choice because it tests D, M, Y, and we already know I and L.

Similarly, ""BIGLY"" tests B, G, Y.

Now, which one? Let's look at letter frequency to maximize the chance of hitting a letter.

Remaining common letters: H, D, U, M, P, G, B, F, Y, K, etc.

D is more common than B, and M is more common than G. So ""DIMLY"" tests D and M, which are more common than B and G.

Therefore, I choose ""DIMLY"".

But note: in ""DIMLY"", the fifth letter is Y. We don't know if Y is in the word. But we are testing it.

So our guess: D I M L Y

But let me confirm the pattern: 
Position 1: D
Position 2: I
Position 3: M
Position 4: L (correct, we know)
Position 5: Y

We are testing I in the second position, which is allowed because the feedback only said I is not in the third.

So we'll go with ""DIMLY"".

But is ""DIMLY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning in a dim manner.

Therefore, our next guess is ""DIMLY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (`x`), so they are eliminated.
- **Guess 2: ""toils""** → 
  - T and O are absent (`x`), so they are eliminated.
  - I is present but in the wrong position (`-`), so I is in the secret word but not in position 3.
  - L is correct and in position 4 (`✓`), so the 4th letter of the secret word is **L**.
  - S is absent (`x`), so it is eliminated.

### Key Insights:
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S (cannot be used).
- **Confirmed positions**: The 4th letter is **L**.
- **Confirmed presence**: **I** is in the word but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5).
- **Pattern**: `_ _ _ L _` (with I in position 1, 2, or 5).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Avoid all eliminated letters.
- Ensure **L** is in position 4.
- Include **I** in position 1, 2, or 5 (since it can't be in position 3).
- Test new high-frequency letters from the remaining alphabet (e.g., D, M, Y, B, G, H, U) to maximize information.
- Prioritize words without double letters to cover more ground.

### Selected Guess: ""DIMLY""
- **Why ""DIMLY""?**
  - Fits the pattern: `D I M L Y` (positions: 1=D, 2=I, 3=M, 4=L, 5=Y).
  - Tests **I** in position 2 (allowed, since I isn't in position 3).
  - Tests new common letters: **D** (high frequency), **M** (common), and **Y** (common vowel substitute).
  - Avoids eliminated letters and double letters.
  - Valid English word (meaning ""faintly or obscurely"").

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Since none of these letters are in the word, we need to choose a new word that uses different letters.
 We should avoid using C, R, A, N, E.

 Now, we must select a word from the remaining letters of the alphabet. We want to test other common letters.

 Common English letters that we haven't tested yet: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, Y, W, F, K, V, J, Q, X, Z.

 We want to maximize information, so we should choose a word with common letters that we haven't used yet.
 Let's consider common vowels: O, I, U (we have no vowels in the word so far, but note that we've already eliminated A and E).
 Also common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

 A good starting word might be ""SLOTH"" but that has O and H which are less common? Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" but U is not very common.

 Alternatively, we can use a word like ""SPILT"": S, P, I, L, T.

 But let me think of a word that uses letters that are frequent and haven't been tried.

 Let me list the top frequent letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... (but we have eliminated E, A, R).

 So from the top, T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U are still available.

 We can choose a word that has several of these.

 Possible words:
   ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S
   ""SOLID"": S, O, L, I, D

 However, note that we have 6 tries and we want to get as much information as possible.

 Another idea: since we know the word doesn't have C, R, A, N, E, we can pick a word that uses common letters we haven't tried.

 Let's pick ""TOILS"": 
   T, O, I, L, S

 But we can also consider words that might have more common letters. How about ""HOIST""? H, O, I, S, T.

 But note that H is less common than some others.

 Another good one is ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T.

 However, M is also not as common as S or T.

 Alternatively, ""SLIMY"": S, L, I, M, Y. But Y might be a vowel too.

 Since we've already eliminated 5 letters, we have plenty of options.

 I think ""TOILS"" is a reasonable choice. But let me see if there's a word that uses more frequent letters.

 According to letter frequency, T is the most common of the remaining, then O, I, S, L, etc.

 We can try ""TULIP"": T, U, L, I, P. But U is less common.

 How about ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T.

 This has S, P, L, I, T. P is somewhat common.

 Another common starting word is ""SHINE"", but E is eliminated so we can't use that.

 Since E and A are eliminated, we have to avoid them.

 I think a good word would be ""MOIST"" or ""GHOUL"", but that has G and H which might be infrequent.

 After considering: Let's choose ""SPILT"" (or ""SPLIT"", both are valid) to test S, P, I, L, T.

 But note: ""SPLIT"" is a valid word. It has S, P, L, I, T.

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" has P, O, I, N, T -> but N was eliminated (from the feedback, N was not present). So we cannot use ""POINT"" because N is eliminated.

 Similarly, we must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 So the word must not include any of these.

 Therefore, ""SPLIT"" is acceptable because it has S, P, L, I, T - none of C,R,A,N,E.

 However, note that in the first guess ""crane"", we got that R is not in the word. So we must avoid R? Actually, R is already eliminated.

 Also, we can use ""STOMP"", but O and M? Let me check: 
   ""STOMP"" has S, T, O, M, P.

 But I think ""SPLIT"" is a good choice because it has common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SHIFT"". It has S, H, I, F, T.

 We want to maximize vowels? We haven't tested O, U, I. In ""SPLIT"", we have I (a vowel) and S, P, L, T (consonants).

 We also haven't tested U or O. Maybe we should test O because it's a common vowel.

 Since A and E are gone, O and I are the most common vowels left. And U is less common.

 So including both O and I might be good? But we can do that in the next guess if needed.

 Considering the above, I propose we choose a word that includes O and I, and avoids the eliminated letters.

 How about ""OUIJA""? That has O, U, I, J, A -> but A is eliminated, so invalid.

 ""AUDIO"" has A and we can't use that.

 So we need a word without A, E.

 How about ""MUSIC"": M, U, S, I, C -> C is eliminated (from feedback: C was marked 'x'), so invalid.

 ""SOLID"": S, O, L, I, D -> acceptable? S, O, L, I, D: none of C,R,A,N,E. So OK.

 ""SOLID"" uses S, O, L, I, D.

 Another one: ""FOIST"": F, O, I, S, T -> acceptable.

 But F is less common.

 Alternatively, ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> N is eliminated, so invalid.

 After reevaluating, I think ""SOLID"" is good: S, O, L, I, D.

 We can also consider ""BUILD"", but B is not very common and we haven't tested B yet? Actually, we haven't tested B, but we might test later.

 Since we want to get vowels tested, O is in ""SOLID"".

 So I choose ""SOLID"".

 However, we have not tested T yet, which is a very common letter. In ""SPLIT"" we would have tested T as well.

 So if we use ""SOLID"", then we don't test T. But we can test T in the next guess if needed.

 Alternatively, if we use ""TOILS"", then we get T, O, I, L, S.

 ""TOILS"" is acceptable: no C,R,A,N,E.

 And it has T and the common vowels O, I.

 So I think ""TOILS"" might be better than ""SOLID"" because T is more common than D.

 Therefore, I'll choose ""TOILS"".

 But note: ""TOILS"" has T, O, I, L, S.

 We haven't used any of these letters.

 So: <guess>toils</guess>

 However, let me confirm that ""TOILS"" is a valid English word? Yes, it means hard work.

 We are going to use this as our second guess.

 But there's also ""TILES"", but we don't have E, so we must avoid E.

 So ""TOILS"" is valid.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""TOILS"".Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"", all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as ""x"", meaning they are **not in the secret word**. Therefore, the new guess must avoid these letters entirely.

- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E  
- To maximize information, prioritize new common letters from the remaining alphabet (e.g., S, T, L, O, I).  
- Selected ""TOILS"" because it:  
  - Uses untested high-frequency letters (T, O, I, S, L).  
  - Contains common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, S, L).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and ensures broad coverage for clues.

   - O: x (not in the word)
   - I: - (in the word but wrong position)
   - L: ✓ (correct position, so L is the 4th letter)
   - S: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter 'I', but not in the 3rd position (since in ""toils"" it was the 3rd letter and marked as wrong position).
- The letter 'L' is in the 4th position (so the 4th letter of the secret word is L).
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S. (We must avoid these in future guesses.)

Additionally, from the first guess, we already eliminated C, R, A, N, E, and now we add T, O, S to the eliminated list.

So eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S.

The secret word has:
- The 4th letter is L.
- It contains the letter I, but not in the 3rd position.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain any of the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S.
- Must include the letter I (since we know it's in the word, but not in the 3rd position).
- Must have L as the 4th letter.

So the word pattern is: _ _ _ L _

And the word must contain I, but not in the 3rd position. So I can be in position 1, 2, or 5.

Now, we need to think of words that fit this pattern and use the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information by testing new common letters. Common letters from the remaining: H, D, U, M, P, G, B, F, Y, etc.

We also know that the word must have an I in either position 1, 2, or 5.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: I in the first position: I _ _ L _
Option 2: I in the second position: _ I _ L _
Option 3: I in the fifth position: _ _ _ L I

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Consider common letters: H, D, U, M, P, G, B, F, Y.

Let's try to think of words:

- For pattern _ _ _ L I: 
  - We need three letters for the first three positions. Examples: 
    - ""JULY"" is 4 letters, not 5.
    - ""MULCH"" has C and H? But C is eliminated. 
    - ""GULCH"" has C -> invalid.
  - How about ""BUHLI""? Not a word.
  - ""DAILY"" has A (eliminated) -> invalid.
  - ""HAULI""? Not a word.

  This pattern might be hard.

- For pattern _ I _ L _: 
  - The second letter is I, and the fourth is L. So: _ I _ L _
  - Examples: 
    - ""BILLY"": B I L L Y -> but the third letter is L, but we already have L in the fourth? And we have two L's? But we don't know if the word has two L's. Also, the third letter would be L, but then the fourth is also L? That might be possible, but let's see the feedback: in ""toils"", we had L in the fourth and it was correct, but we don't know about other positions. However, the feedback for ""toils"" didn't show a second L, but that doesn't mean there isn't one. But in ""toils"", the L was in the fourth and correct, and the other letters were not L. So if the word had two L's, then in ""toils"" we would have only one L (in the correct position) and the other L might be in a different position and not guessed? Actually, in ""toils"" we only have one L. So if the secret word has two L's, then when we guessed ""toils"", the L in the fourth would be correct, and the other L would be in a position we didn't guess, so it wouldn't show. But we don't know if there is a second L. So we can't rule it out.

  But let's stick to words we know. 
  - ""DILLY"": D I L L Y -> but then the third letter is L, which would be the same as the fourth? And we have two L's. Also, the pattern would be: second letter I, third letter L, fourth letter L? That doesn't work because the fourth letter is L, but the third is also L? Then the word would be _ I L L _. But in our pattern, the fourth is L, so the third can be something else. Actually, in ""DILLY"", the third letter is L and the fourth is L? No: D-I-L-L-Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y. So the fourth letter is L, which matches, but we also have L in the third. But we don't know if that's allowed. However, we must avoid eliminated letters. D, I, L, Y are not eliminated? D is not eliminated, I is allowed, L is in the word, Y is not eliminated. But we have two L's? The feedback from ""toils"" only showed one L (in the fourth) and the I was present but not in the third. It didn't show a second L because we didn't guess a second L. So it's possible.

  But let's see if ""DILLY"" is valid? It is a word, meaning something that is silly or foolish.

  However, we are not sure about double letters. We should avoid assuming double letters for now because we don't have evidence.

- Another word: ""KILLY""? Not a word.

- ""HILLY"": H I L L Y -> same as above.

- ""WILLY"": W I L L Y -> same.

- ""PILLY"": P I L L Y -> same.

But these all have double L. We don't know if the word has double L. We might be able to test without double letters.

- Without double L: 
  - Pattern: _ I _ L _
  - We need a letter for first, third, and fifth.

  Examples:
    - ""BIGLY"": B I G L Y -> valid? It means in a big manner? It's an adverb. But it's accepted in Wordle.
    - ""DIMLY"": D I M L Y -> valid, meaning faintly or obscurely.
    - ""DIPLY"": Not a word.
    - ""FILLY"": F I L L Y -> double L.

  So ""BIGLY"" and ""DIMLY"" are options.

- Pattern with I in the first position: I _ _ L _
  - Examples: 
    - ""IDLY"": too short.
    - ""IDYLL"": 5 letters? I-D-Y-L-L -> but that's 5 letters, but has double L and Y. Also, the fourth letter is L, which is correct, but the fifth is L? Then the word is I D Y L L? Actually, ""IDYLL"" is I-D-Y-L-L, so positions: 1:I, 2:D, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:L. So again double L.
    - ""ITCHY"": I T C H Y -> but T and C are eliminated -> invalid.
    - ""IMPEL"": I M P E L -> E is eliminated -> invalid.
    - ""INPUT"": I N P U T -> N and T eliminated -> invalid.

  Hard to find without eliminated letters.

- Pattern with I in the fifth position: _ _ _ L I
  - Examples:
    - ""MULCHI"": not a word.
    - ""JULI"" is 4 letters.
    - ""BULGY"": B U L G Y -> but the fourth letter is G? We need L in the fourth. So this is B U L G Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:G, 5:Y -> but we need the fourth to be L, so that doesn't work.
    - We need the fourth letter to be L, so the word must end with ""LI"". 
    - So pattern: _ _ _ L I
    - Examples: 
        - ""AALII"": has A (eliminated) -> invalid.
        - ""KULFI"": K U L F I -> positions: 1:K, 2:U, 3:L, 4:F, 5:I -> but the fourth letter is F, not L. We need the fourth to be L? No, the pattern is _ _ _ L I, so the fourth is L and the fifth is I. So the third letter is the one before L. So the word is: letter1, letter2, letter3, L, I.
        - ""BALTI"": has A -> invalid.
        - ""DELHI"": D E L H I -> E is eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""FOLKI"": F O L K I -> O is eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""GULFI"": G U L F I -> same as above, fourth letter is F? No: G(1), U(2), L(3), F(4), I(5). But we need the fourth to be L? That would require the third to be something and the fourth L. So if the word ends with ""LI"", then the L is the fourth? Actually, in a 5-letter word, if it ends with ""LI"", then the fourth letter is L and the fifth is I. So the word is: ? ? ? L I. The third letter is the one at position 3.

        So for example, ""HULKI"" -> H U L K I -> positions: 1:H, 2:U, 3:L, 4:K, 5:I -> but then the fourth letter is K, not L. We need the fourth letter to be L, so the third letter must be the one that comes before the L? Actually, no: the fourth letter is the L. So the word should be: [1] [2] [3] L I. So the third letter is at position 3, and the fourth is L at position 4.

        Example: ""PULI"" is 4 letters. 
        ""PULIK"" is not a word.

        How about ""XYLYL""? But that has X and Y, and it's not common. Also, it has two L's and two Y's.

        This pattern is difficult.

Given the above, it seems the pattern with I in the second position is more promising. We have words like ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"".

But note: in ""DIMLY"", the letters are D, I, M, L, Y. 
- We haven't eliminated D, M, Y. 
- The word has I in the second position and L in the fourth.

Similarly, ""BIGLY"" has B, I, G, L, Y.

We also have ""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y -> but then the fourth letter is P, not L. So that doesn't fit.

Another one: ""JIGLY"": J, I, G, L, Y -> valid? It means jiggly. But we have L in the fourth? J(1), I(2), G(3), L(4), Y(5). Yes, that fits.

But J is not very common.

Alternatively, ""HILLY"" has double L, but we can consider it.

But let's avoid double letters for now to get more information.

So between ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"", which one to choose?

We can also consider ""DIVLY""? Not a word.

""PIGLY""? Not a word.

""FIGLY""? Not a word.

So ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"" are candidates.

We can also consider ""BIDDY"" but that has D and Y, and the pattern: B I D D Y -> no L in the fourth? Doesn't fit.

Another word: ""MILKY"" -> M I L K Y -> but then the third letter is L, so the fourth would be K? We need the fourth to be L. So that doesn't work.

So back to ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"".

We can also consider ""WILDLY"" is 6 letters.

Or ""GIDDY"" has no L.

So let's choose between ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"".

We want to test more common letters. The letters in ""DIMLY"": D, I, M, L, Y. 
The letters in ""BIGLY"": B, I, G, L, Y.

Common letters: D is more common than B? According to English letter frequency, D is more common than B and G. But we are testing M in ""DIMLY"" and G in ""BIGLY"". M is more common than G.

But we are also testing Y in both.

Alternatively, we can test a word that has U or H, which are common.

But in the pattern _ I _ L _, we can try:

""LIGHT"" has T (eliminated) -> invalid.

""PILED"" has E -> invalid.

""GUILD"": G U I L D -> but the fourth letter is D? We need the fourth to be L. So the word is G U I L D -> positions: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D. So the fourth is L, which is correct, and the third is I? But we know that I is in the word but not in the third position (from the feedback of ""toils""). In ""toils"", I was in the third position and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has an I, but not in the third position. However, in ""GUILD"", we are putting I in the third position. But the feedback said that I is not in the third position, so we cannot put I in the third position in any guess? 

Wait, no: the feedback for ""toils"" was that I is in the word but not in the third position. So the secret word has an I, but it is not at position 3. Therefore, in our new guess, we must not put I in the third position. So for the pattern _ I _ L _, we are putting I in the second position, which is allowed. But if we try a word that has I in the third position, that would be invalid because we know I is not in the third position.

So in ""GUILD"", if we put I in the third position, that would be incorrect because we know the secret word does not have I in the third position. Therefore, we cannot use ""GUILD"" because it has I in the third position.

Similarly, any word that has I in the third position is invalid.

Therefore, for the pattern, we can only have I in the first, second, or fifth position. But in the pattern _ I _ L _, we are putting I in the second position, which is okay.

So ""GUILD"" is invalid because it has I in the third.

Now, back to ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"": both have I in the second position, which is allowed.

We can also consider ""HILLY"", but it has double L. But let's see: ""HILLY"" has I in the second and L in the fourth, but also L in the third. The third letter is L. We don't know if the word has an L in the third? But we know the fourth is L, and we don't have information about other positions. However, we are allowed to have L in the third? The feedback from ""toils"" only told us that the fourth letter is L and that I is not in the third. It didn't say anything about L in the third. So it's possible.

But if we use ""HILLY"", we are testing the same L twice? We already know the fourth is L, so if we put L in the third, we might get feedback on that. But we are trying to get more information, so testing a double L might be good? Or it might be wasteful? Since we have limited guesses.

Alternatively, we can avoid double letters to test more new letters.

So I think ""DIMLY"" is a good choice because it tests D, M, Y, and we already know I and L.

Similarly, ""BIGLY"" tests B, G, Y.

Now, which one? Let's look at letter frequency to maximize the chance of hitting a letter.

Remaining common letters: H, D, U, M, P, G, B, F, Y, K, etc.

D is more common than B, and M is more common than G. So ""DIMLY"" tests D and M, which are more common than B and G.

Therefore, I choose ""DIMLY"".

But note: in ""DIMLY"", the fifth letter is Y. We don't know if Y is in the word. But we are testing it.

So our guess: D I M L Y

But let me confirm the pattern: 
Position 1: D
Position 2: I
Position 3: M
Position 4: L (correct, we know)
Position 5: Y

We are testing I in the second position, which is allowed because the feedback only said I is not in the third.

So we'll go with ""DIMLY"".

But is ""DIMLY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning in a dim manner.

Therefore, our next guess is ""DIMLY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (`x`), so they are eliminated.
- **Guess 2: ""toils""** → 
  - T and O are absent (`x`), so they are eliminated.
  - I is present but in the wrong position (`-`), so I is in the secret word but not in position 3.
  - L is correct and in position 4 (`✓`), so the 4th letter of the secret word is **L**.
  - S is absent (`x`), so it is eliminated.

### Key Insights:
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S (cannot be used).
- **Confirmed positions**: The 4th letter is **L**.
- **Confirmed presence**: **I** is in the word but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5).
- **Pattern**: `_ _ _ L _` (with I in position 1, 2, or 5).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Avoid all eliminated letters.
- Ensure **L** is in position 4.
- Include **I** in position 1, 2, or 5 (since it can't be in position 3).
- Test new high-frequency letters from the remaining alphabet (e.g., D, M, Y, B, G, H, U) to maximize information.
- Prioritize words without double letters to cover more ground.

### Selected Guess: ""DIMLY""
- **Why ""DIMLY""?**
  - Fits the pattern: `D I M L Y` (positions: 1=D, 2=I, 3=M, 4=L, 5=Y).
  - Tests **I** in position 2 (allowed, since I isn't in position 3).
  - Tests new common letters: **D** (high frequency), **M** (common), and **Y** (common vowel substitute).
  - Avoids eliminated letters and double letters.
  - Valid English word (meaning ""faintly or obscurely"").

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities by testing key letters while adhering to constraints.

Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" but U is not very common.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word like ""SPILT"": S, P, I, L, T.\n\n But let me think of a word that uses letters that are frequent and haven\'t been tried.\n\n Let me list the top frequent letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... (but we have eliminated E, A, R).\n\n So from the top, T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U are still available.\n\n We can choose a word that has several of these.\n\n Possible words:\n   ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S\n   ""SOLID"": S, O, L, I, D\n\n However, note that we have 6 tries and we want to get as much information as possible.\n\n Another idea: since we know the word doesn\'t have C, R, A, N, E, we can pick a word that uses common letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n Let\'s pick ""TOILS"": \n   T, O, I, L, S\n\n But we can also consider words that might have more common letters.

So we cannot use ""POINT"" because N is eliminated.\n\n Similarly, we must avoid C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So the word must not include any of these.\n\n Therefore, ""SPLIT"" is acceptable because it has S, P, L, I, T - none of C,R,A,N,E.\n\n However, note that in the first guess ""crane"", we got that R is not in the word. So we must avoid R? Actually, R is already eliminated.\n\n Also, we can use ""STOMP"", but O and M? Let me check: \n   ""STOMP"" has S, T, O, M, P.\n\n But I think ""SPLIT"" is a good choice because it has common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""SHIFT"". It has S, H, I, F, T.\n\n We want to maximize vowels? We haven\'t tested O, U, I. In ""SPLIT"", we have I (a vowel) and S, P, L, T (consonants).\n\n We also haven\'t tested U or O. Maybe we should test O because it\'s a common vowel.\n\n Since A and E are gone, O and I are the most common vowels left. And U is less common.\n\n So including both O and I might be good? But we can do that in the next guess if needed.\n\n Considering the above, I propose we choose a word that includes O and I, and avoids the eliminated letters.\n\n How about ""OUIJA""? That has O, U, I, J, A -> but A is eliminated, so invalid.\n\n ""AUDIO"" has A and we can\'t use that.\n\n So we need a word without A, E.\n\n How about ""MUSIC"": M, U, S, I, C -> C is eliminated (from feedback: C was marked \'x\'), so invalid.\n\n ""SOLID"": S, O, L, I, D -> acceptable? S, O, L, I, D: none of C,R,A,N,E. So OK.\n\n ""SOLID"" uses S, O, L, I, D.\n\n Another one: ""FOIST"": F, O, I, S, T -> acceptable.\n\n But F is less common.\n\n Alternatively, ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> N is eliminated, so invalid.\n\n After reevaluating, I think ""SOLID"" is good: S, O, L, I, D.\n\n We can also consider ""BUILD"", but B is not very common and we haven\'t tested B yet? Actually, we haven\'t tested B, but we might test later.\n\n Since we want to get vowels tested, O is in ""SOLID"".\n\n So I choose ""SOLID"".\n\n However, we have not tested T yet, which is a very common letter.

Yes, it means hard work.\n\n We are going to use this as our second guess.\n\n But there\'s also ""TILES"", but we don\'t have E, so we must avoid E.\n\n So ""TOILS"" is valid.\n\n Therefore, our next guess is ""TOILS"".Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"", all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are marked as ""x"", meaning they are **not in the secret word**.

(We must avoid these in future guesses.)\n\nAdditionally, from the first guess, we already eliminated C, R, A, N, E, and now we add T, O, S to the eliminated list.\n\nSo eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S.\n\nThe secret word has:\n- The 4th letter is L.\n- It contains the letter I, but not in the 3rd position.\n\nWe need to choose a new 5-letter word that:\n- Does not contain any of the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S.\n- Must include the letter I (since we know it\'s in the word, but not in the 3rd position).\n- Must have L as the 4th letter.\n\nSo the word pattern is: _ _ _ L _\n\nAnd the word must contain I, but not in the 3rd position. So I can be in position 1, 2, or 5.\n\nNow, we need to think of words that fit this pattern and use the remaining letters.\n\nRemaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to maximize information by testing new common letters. Common letters from the remaining: H, D, U, M, P, G, B, F, Y, etc.\n\nWe also know that the word must have an I in either position 1, 2, or 5.\n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nOption 1: I in the first position: I _ _ L _\nOption 2: I in the second position: _ I _ L _\nOption 3: I in the fifth position: _ _ _ L I\n\nWe should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nConsider common letters: H, D, U, M, P, G, B, F, Y.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words:\n\n- For pattern _ _ _ L I: \n  - We need three letters for the first three positions. Examples: \n    - ""JULY"" is 4 letters, not 5.\n    - ""MULCH"" has C and H? But C is eliminated. \n    - ""GULCH"" has C -> invalid.\n  - How about ""BUHLI""? Not a word.\n  - ""DAILY"" has A (eliminated) -> invalid.\n  - ""HAULI""? Not a word.\n\n  This pattern might be hard.\n\n- For pattern _ I _ L _: \n  - The second letter is I, and the fourth is L. So: _ I _ L _\n  - Examples: \n    - ""BILLY"": B I L L Y -> but the third letter is L, but we already have L in the fourth? And we have two L\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two L\'s. Also, the third letter would be L, but then the fourth is also L? That might be possible, but let\'s see the feedback: in ""toils"", we had L in the fourth and it was correct, but we don\'t know about other positions. However, the feedback for ""toils"" didn\'t show a second L, but that doesn\'t mean there isn\'t one. But in ""toils"", the L was in the fourth and correct, and the other letters were not L. So if the word had two L\'s, then in ""toils"" we would have only one L (in the correct position) and the other L might be in a different position and not guessed? Actually, in ""toils"" we only have one L. So if the secret word has two L\'s, then when we guessed ""toils"", the L in the fourth would be correct, and the other L would be in a position we didn\'t guess, so it wouldn\'t show. But we don\'t know if there is a second L. So we can\'t rule it out.\n\n  But let\'s stick to words we know. \n  - ""DILLY"": D I L L Y -> but then the third letter is L, which would be the same as the fourth? And we have two L\'s. Also, the pattern would be: second letter I, third letter L, fourth letter L? That doesn\'t work because the fourth letter is L, but the third is also L? Then the word would be _ I L L _. But in our pattern, the fourth is L, so the third can be something else. Actually, in ""DILLY"", the third letter is L and the fourth is L? No: D-I-L-L-Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y. So the fourth letter is L, which matches, but we also have L in the third. But we don\'t know if that\'s allowed. However, we must avoid eliminated letters. D, I, L, Y are not eliminated? D is not eliminated, I is allowed, L is in the word, Y is not eliminated. But we have two L\'s? The feedback from ""toils"" only showed one L (in the fourth) and the I was present but not in the third. It didn\'t show a second L because we didn\'t guess a second L. So it\'s possible.\n\n  But let\'s see if ""DILLY"" is valid? It is a word, meaning something that is silly or foolish.\n\n  However, we are not sure about double letters. We should avoid assuming double letters for now because we don\'t have evidence.\n\n- Another word: ""KILLY""? Not a word.\n\n- ""HILLY"": H I L L Y -> same as above.\n\n- ""WILLY"": W I L L Y -> same.\n\n- ""PILLY"": P I L L Y -> same.\n\nBut these all have double L. We don\'t know if the word has double L. We might be able to test without double letters.\n\n- Without double L: \n  - Pattern: _ I _ L _\n  - We need a letter for first, third, and fifth.\n\n  Examples:\n    - ""BIGLY"": B I G L Y -> valid? It means in a big manner? It\'s an adverb. But it\'s accepted in Wordle.\n    - ""DIMLY"": D I M L Y -> valid, meaning faintly or obscurely.\n    - ""DIPLY"": Not a word.\n    - ""FILLY"": F I L L Y -> double L.\n\n  So ""BIGLY"" and ""DIMLY"" are options.\n\n- Pattern with I in the first position: I _ _ L _\n  - Examples: \n    - ""IDLY"": too short.\n    - ""IDYLL"": 5 letters? I-D-Y-L-L -> but that\'s 5 letters, but has double L and Y. Also, the fourth letter is L, which is correct, but the fifth is L? Then the word is I D Y L L? Actually, ""IDYLL"" is I-D-Y-L-L, so positions: 1:I, 2:D, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:L. So again double L.\n    - ""ITCHY"": I T C H Y -> but T and C are eliminated -> invalid.\n    - ""IMPEL"": I M P E L -> E is eliminated -> invalid.\n    - ""INPUT"": I N P U T -> N and T eliminated -> invalid.\n\n  Hard to find without eliminated letters.\n\n- Pattern with I in the fifth position: _ _ _ L I\n  - Examples:\n    - ""MULCHI"": not a word.\n    - ""JULI"" is 4 letters.\n    - ""BULGY"": B U L G Y -> but the fourth letter is G? We need L in the fourth. So this is B U L G Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:G, 5:Y -> but we need the fourth to be L, so that doesn\'t work.\n    - We need the fourth letter to be L, so the word must end with ""LI"". \n    - So pattern: _ _ _ L I\n    - Examples: \n        - ""AALII"": has A (eliminated) -> invalid.\n        - ""KULFI"": K U L F I -> positions: 1:K, 2:U, 3:L, 4:F, 5:I -> but the fourth letter is F, not L. We need the fourth to be L? No, the pattern is _ _ _ L I, so the fourth is L and the fifth is I. So the third letter is the one before L. So the word is: letter1, letter2, letter3, L, I.\n        - ""BALTI"": has A -> invalid.\n        - ""DELHI"": D E L H I -> E is eliminated -> invalid.\n        - ""FOLKI"": F O L K I -> O is eliminated -> invalid.\n        - ""GULFI"": G U L F I -> same as above, fourth letter is F? No: G(1), U(2), L(3), F(4), I(5). But we need the fourth to be L? That would require the third to be something and the fourth L. So if the word ends with ""LI"", then the L is the fourth? Actually, in a 5-letter word, if it ends with ""LI"", then the fourth letter is L and the fifth is I. So the word is: ? ? ? L I. The third letter is the one at position 3.\n\n        So for example, ""HULKI"" -> H U L K I -> positions: 1:H, 2:U, 3:L, 4:K, 5:I -> but then the fourth letter is K, not L. We need the fourth letter to be L, so the third letter must be the one that comes before the L? Actually, no: the fourth letter is the L. So the word should be: [1] [2] [3] L I. So the third letter is at position 3, and the fourth is L at position 4.\n\n        Example: ""PULI"" is 4 letters. \n        ""PULIK"" is not a word.\n\n        How about ""XYLYL""? But that has X and Y, and it\'s not common. Also, it has two L\'s and two Y\'s.\n\n        This pattern is difficult.\n\nGiven the above, it seems the pattern with I in the second position is more promising. We have words like ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"".\n\nBut note: in ""DIMLY"", the letters are D, I, M, L, Y. \n- We haven\'t eliminated D, M, Y. \n- The word has I in the second position and L in the fourth.\n\nSimilarly, ""BIGLY"" has B, I, G, L, Y.\n\nWe also have ""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y -> but then the fourth letter is P, not L. So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother one: ""JIGLY"": J, I, G, L, Y -> valid? It means jiggly. But we have L in the fourth? J(1), I(2), G(3), L(4), Y(5). Yes, that fits.\n\nBut J is not very common.\n\nAlternatively, ""HILLY"" has double L, but we can consider it.\n\nBut let\'s avoid double letters for now to get more information.\n\nSo between ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"", which one to choose?\n\nWe can also consider ""DIVLY""? Not a word.\n\n""PIGLY""? Not a word.\n\n""FIGLY""? Not a word.\n\nSo ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"" are candidates.\n\nWe can also consider ""BIDDY"" but that has D and Y, and the pattern: B I D D Y -> no L in the fourth? Doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother word: ""MILKY"" -> M I L K Y -> but then the third letter is L, so the fourth would be K? We need the fourth to be L. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nSo back to ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"".\n\nWe can also consider ""WILDLY"" is 6 letters.\n\nOr ""GIDDY"" has no L.\n\nSo let\'s choose between ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"".\n\nWe want to test more common letters. The letters in ""DIMLY"": D, I, M, L, Y. \nThe letters in ""BIGLY"": B, I, G, L, Y.\n\nCommon letters: D is more common than B? According to English letter frequency, D is more common than B and G. But we are testing M in ""DIMLY"" and G in ""BIGLY"". M is more common than G.\n\nBut we are also testing Y in both.\n\nAlternatively, we can test a word that has U or H, which are common.\n\nBut in the pattern _ I _ L _, we can try:\n\n""LIGHT"" has T (eliminated) -> invalid.\n\n""PILED"" has E -> invalid.\n\n""GUILD"": G U I L D -> but the fourth letter is D? We need the fourth to be L. So the word is G U I L D -> positions: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D. So the fourth is L, which is correct, and the third is I? But we know that I is in the word but not in the third position (from the feedback of ""toils""). In ""toils"", I was in the third position and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has an I, but not in the third position. However, in ""GUILD"", we are putting I in the third position. But the feedback said that I is not in the third position, so we cannot put I in the third position in any guess? \n\nWait, no: the feedback for ""toils"" was that I is in the word but not in the third position. So the secret word has an I, but it is not at position 3. Therefore, in our new guess, we must not put I in the third position. So for the pattern _ I _ L _, we are putting I in the second position, which is allowed. But if we try a word that has I in the third position, that would be invalid because we know I is not in the third position.\n\nSo in ""GUILD"", if we put I in the third position, that would be incorrect because we know the secret word does not have I in the third position. Therefore, we cannot use ""GUILD"" because it has I in the third position.\n\nSimilarly, any word that has I in the third position is invalid.\n\nTherefore, for the pattern, we can only have I in the first, second, or fifth position. But in the pattern _ I _ L _, we are putting I in the second position, which is okay.\n\nSo ""GUILD"" is invalid because it has I in the third.\n\nNow, back to ""DIMLY"" and ""BIGLY"": both have I in the second position, which is allowed.\n\nWe can also consider ""HILLY"", but it has double L. But let\'s see: ""HILLY"" has I in the second and L in the fourth, but also L in the third. The third letter is L. We don\'t know if the word has an L in the third? But we know the fourth is L, and we don\'t have information about other positions. However, we are allowed to have L in the third? The feedback from ""toils"" only told us that the fourth letter is L and that I is not in the third. It didn\'t say anything about L in the third. So it\'s possible.\n\nBut if we use ""HILLY"", we are testing the same L twice? We already know the fourth is L, so if we put L in the third, we might get feedback on that. But we are trying to get more information, so testing a double L might be good? Or it might be wasteful? Since we have limited guesses.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid double letters to test more new letters.\n\nSo I think ""DIMLY"" is a good choice because it tests D, M, Y, and we already know I and L.\n\nSimilarly, ""BIGLY"" tests B, G, Y.\n\nNow, which one? Let\'s look at letter frequency to maximize the chance of hitting a letter.\n\nRemaining common letters: H, D, U, M, P, G, B, F, Y, K, etc.\n\nD is more common than B, and M is more common than G. So ""DIMLY"" tests D and M, which are more common than B and G.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""DIMLY"".\n\nBut note: in ""DIMLY"", the fifth letter is Y. We don\'t know if Y is in the word. But we are testing it.\n\nSo our guess: D I M L Y\n\nBut let me confirm the pattern: \nPosition 1: D\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: M\nPosition 4: L (correct, we know)\nPosition 5: Y\n\nWe are testing I in the second position, which is allowed because the feedback only said I is not in the third.\n\nSo we\'ll go with ""DIMLY"".\n\nBut is ""DIMLY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning in a dim manner.\n\nTherefore, our next guess is ""DIMLY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (`x`), so they are eliminated.\n- **Guess 2: ""toils""** → \n  - T and O are absent (`x`), so they are eliminated.\n  - I is present but in the wrong position (`-`), so I is in the secret word but not in position 3.\n  - L is correct and in position 4 (`✓`), so the 4th letter of the secret word is **L**.\n  - S is absent (`x`), so it is eliminated.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S (cannot be used).\n- **Confirmed positions**: The 4th letter is **L**.\n- **Confirmed presence**: **I** is in the word but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5).\n- **Pattern**: `_ _ _ L _` (with I in position 1, 2, or 5).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Avoid all eliminated letters.\n- Ensure **L** is in position 4.\n- Include **I** in position 1, 2, or 5 (since it can\'t be in position 3).\n- Test new high-frequency letters from the remaining alphabet (e.g., D, M, Y, B, G, H, U) to maximize information.\n- Prioritize words without double letters to cover more ground.\n\n### Selected Guess: ""DIMLY""\n- **Why ""DIMLY""?**\n  - Fits the pattern: `D I M L Y` (positions: 1=D, 2=I, 3=M, 4=L, 5=Y).\n  - Tests **I** in position 2 (allowed, since I isn\'t in position 3).\n  - Tests new common letters: **D** (high frequency), **M** (common), and **Y** (common vowel substitute).\n  - Avoids eliminated letters and double letters.\n  - Valid English word (meaning ""faintly or obscurely"").\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down possibilities by testing key letters while adhering to constraints.\n\n<guess>dimly</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) I(-) L(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: dimly -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) I(✓) M(x) L(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess ""dimly"": 
  D(✓) I(✓) M(x) L(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- D is correct and in the first position (position 1).
- I is correct and in the second position (position 2).
- M is not in the word.
- L is correct and in the fourth position (position 4). (We already knew L was in position 4 from guess 2, now confirmed).
- Y is correct and in the fifth position (position 5).

So the secret word has:
  Position 1: D
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: ? (but not M, and also not any eliminated letters)
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: Y

Therefore, the secret word is: D I _ L Y

We know the letter in the third position is missing, and it cannot be M (since M is not in the word) and cannot be any previously eliminated letters.

From previous feedback, eliminated letters include:
  From guess 1: C, R, A, N, E
  From guess 2: T, O, S
  From guess 3: M

So total eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S, M.

We must fill the third position with a letter not in this list and not D, I, L, Y (but since positions matter, we can use a letter that is not already in the word? Not necessarily, because we don't know if the word has repeated letters. However, we haven't encountered repeated letters yet, so it's possible. But the feedback doesn't show any repeated letters so far.

Now, the word is ""D I _ L Y"". We need to find a letter for the third position that is not eliminated.

Available letters: 
  Entire alphabet except: C,R,A,N,E,T,O,S,M and the known letters D,I,L,Y (but note, D,I,L,Y are already in the word, so if we use one of them again, it would be a duplicate).

But in the feedback for ""dimly"", we had all letters except M being correct or not present. Specifically, D, I, L, Y were marked as present and correct. There was no indication of any duplicate because we didn't test a duplicate. So we don't know if duplicates are present.

However, for the third position, since D,I,L,Y are already used, we don't know if the word allows duplicates. But we can avoid duplicates for now to test a new letter.

So we want to choose a letter for the third position that is not eliminated and not already used? But we don't know if the word has duplicates. Actually, the feedback only marked M as absent, so the third letter is neither M nor any of the eliminated ones.

Possible letters for the third position: 
  Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Now, we must form a word that starts with ""DI"", ends with ""LY"", and has one of these letters in the middle.

Common English words of the form ""DI?LY"" (where ? is a letter):

  We know ""dimly"" but we guessed that and the third letter was M, which is wrong.

So what words exist?

  - ""Dilly"": D I L L Y -> but this has two L's: positions 3 and 4 both L. But we have L in position 4. So if we try ""dilly"", it would be D I L L Y.

  However, we know that the fourth letter is L, and if we put L in the third position, that might be possible. But note, in guess 3, we didn't have L in the third position, so we wouldn't have received feedback on that.

  Let's see: if the word were ""dilly"", we would have positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y.

  But in ""dimly"" we guessed M in the third position which was wrong, so if the third letter is L, then in ""dimly"", the third letter M is absent, and we have the fourth letter L correct. But there is another L in the third position? Then the feedback for ""dimly"" should show that L is in the word but in the wrong position? Or if it was in the third position and we guessed M, that wouldn't show? Actually, feedback for the third position was M, which was not in the word. The L in the fourth was correct. There's no indication of the extra L at position 3 because we didn't guess it. So ""dilly"" is possible.

  But note: if the secret word were ""dilly"", then the third letter is L. However, we already know that L is in the word (at position 4), so having L in position 3 as well would mean we have duplicate L. But how would the feedback react? When we guessed ""toils"", which had L in the fourth position and it was correct, but no additional L. So if the word has double L, then when we guess a word with one L in the correct position, the other L would not be indicated? Actually, if a letter appears multiple times, each guess is assessed independently.

  As per Wordle rules, if a letter appears multiple times in the secret word, and you guess that letter once, you get feedback for that one occurrence. If you guess it in the correct position, you get a ✓. If you guess it in a wrong position but it appears elsewhere, you get a -. If you guess fewer than the number in the secret, only the best matches count? So the feedback might not reveal duplicates.

  But in this case, for ""dilly"", in guess 3 ""dimly"": the secret word has L at position 3 and 4. We guessed L only at position 4 (correct). For position 3, we guessed M (absent). So no feedback would indicate that there is an L at position 3.

  Similarly, in guess 2: ""toils"" had no third position L, so no indication.

  Therefore, ""dilly"" is a possibility.

Other words? 

  - ""Dicey"": but has C and E -> eliminated.
  - ""Digit"": has G and T, but T eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""Dinky"": D I N K Y -> N eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""Dippy"": D I P P Y -> but ends with PY? No, it must end with LY? The last two are PY, not LY. So not matching the pattern.

  In our pattern, the word must be DI?LY, so the last two are LY, so the fifth letter is Y and the fourth is L.

  So possible words: 
      ""DILLY"" (with L in third position)
      ""DIGLY""? Not a word.
      ""DIHLY""? No.
      ""DIKLY""? No.
      ""DIPLY""? Not a word.
      ""DIZZY""? Ends with ZY -> invalid.

  Another one: ""DIVLY""? Not a word.

  ""DIZZY"" is not ending with LY.

  How about ""DAILY""? But A is eliminated -> invalid.

  ""DOILY""? But O is eliminated -> invalid.

  So the only common word I can think of is ""dilly"".

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""dilly"".

But to confirm, we can guess ""dilly"". However, we have 6 tries so far and we are at the third guess? Actually, we have made three guesses: crane, toils, dimly. So next is the fourth guess.

If we guess ""dilly"", we might win.

But let me see if there are other possibilities. 

  What about words with other letters? Such as ""DIULY""? Not a word.

  Or ""DIGLY"": not a word.

  Or ""DIWLY"": no.

So it seems ""dilly"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""dilly"".

But note: the available letters include B, F, G, H, etc., but no common words.

Another possibility: ""Filly"" but starts with F, not D -> not D.

We need the word to start with ""DI"" and end with ""Y"", fourth letter L.

So only ""dilly"" comes to mind.

Thus, we'll guess ""dilly"".

But we must make sure it doesn't violate eliminated letters. ""Dilly"": D, I, L, L, Y. Eliminated letters are C,R,A,N,E,T,O,S,M. None of these are in ""dilly"", so valid.

So guess is ""dilly"".

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Feedback Recap**:
   - **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent (`x`).  
     → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.
   - **Guess 2: ""toils""** → 
     - T and O absent (`x`) → Add T, O to eliminated letters.
     - I present but wrong position (`-`) → Secret word contains I, but not in position 3.
     - L correct in position 4 (`✓`) → **4th letter is confirmed as L**.
     - S absent (`x`) → Add S to eliminated letters.
     → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S.
   - **Guess 3: ""dimly""** → 
     - D correct in position 1 (`✓`) → **1st letter is D**.
     - I correct in position 2 (`✓`) → **2nd letter is I**.
     - M absent (`x`) → Add M to eliminated letters.
     - L correct in position 4 (`✓`) → Confirms L in position 4 (already known).
     - Y correct in position 5 (`✓`) → **5th letter is Y**.
     → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S, M.  
     → **Secret word pattern**: D I _ L Y (only position 3 missing).

2. **Current Constraints**:
   - **Pattern**: `D I _ L Y`
   - Position 3 must be a letter **not eliminated**: Available options: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
   - **Guesses must exclude**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S, M.
   - Since the secret word contains D, I, L, Y with no duplicates indicated in feedback, position 3 should ideally be a **new letter** for maximum information, though duplicates are still possible.

3. **Possible Words**:
   - Common English words fitting `D I _ L Y`:
     - ""**DILLY**"" (D I L L Y) → Valid word. Position 3: L (not eliminated).  
       → Ens L is duplicated? Feedback didn't rule it out.
     - **No other common words exist**. Alternatives like ""DIGLY"", ""DIKLY"", or ""DIPLY"" are invalid/obscure. Words like ""DAILY"" or ""DOILY"" contain eliminated letters (A, O).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - ""**DILLY**"" is the **only viable common word** matching the pattern and constraints.
   - If correct, this will win the game. If incorrect, the feedback on L will help identify duplicates or alternatives (though unlikely given available letters).

<guess>dilly</guess>",dilly,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""dimly"":

- M is not in the word.
- L is correct and in the fourth position (position 4). (We already knew L was in position 4 from guess 2, now confirmed).
- Y is correct and in the fifth position (position 5).

So the secret word has:
  Position 1: D
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: ? (but not M, and also not any eliminated letters)
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: Y

Therefore, the secret word is: D I _ L Y

We know the letter in the third position is missing, and it cannot be M (since M is not in the word) and cannot be any previously eliminated letters.

From previous feedback, eliminated letters include:
  From guess 1: C, R, A, N, E
  From guess 2: T, O, S
  From guess 3: M

So total eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S, M.

We must fill the third position with a letter not in this list and not D, I, L, Y (but since positions matter, we can use a letter that is not already in the word? Not necessarily, because we don't know if the word has repeated letters. However, we haven't encountered repeated letters yet, so it's possible. But the feedback doesn't show any repeated letters so far.

Now, the word is ""D I _ L Y"". We need to find a letter for the third position that is not eliminated.

Available letters: 
  Entire alphabet except: C,R,A,N,E,T,O,S,M and the known letters D,I,L,Y (but note, D,I,L,Y are already in the word, so if we use one of them again, it would be a duplicate).

But in the feedback for ""dimly"", we had all letters except M being correct or not present. Specifically, D, I, L, Y were marked as present and correct. There was no indication of any duplicate because we didn't test a duplicate. So we don't know if duplicates are present.

However, for the third position, since D,I,L,Y are already used, we don't know if the word allows duplicates. But we can avoid duplicates for now to test a new letter.

So we want to choose a letter for the third position that is not eliminated and not already used? But we don't know if the word has duplicates. Actually, the feedback only marked M as absent, so the third letter is neither M nor any of the eliminated ones.

Possible letters for the third position: 
  Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Now, we must form a word that starts with ""DI"", ends with ""LY"", and has one of these letters in the middle.

Common English words of the form ""DI?LY"" (where ? is a letter):

  We know ""dimly"" but we guessed that and the third letter was M, which is wrong.

So what words exist?

  - ""Dilly"": D I L L Y -> but this has two L's: positions 3 and 4 both L. But we have L in position 4. So if we try ""dilly"", it would be D I L L Y.

  However, we know that the fourth letter is L, and if we put L in the third position, that might be possible. But note, in guess 3, we didn't have L in the third position, so we wouldn't have received feedback on that.

  Let's see: if the word were ""dilly"", we would have positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y.

  But in ""dimly"" we guessed M in the third position which was wrong, so if the third letter is L, then in ""dimly"", the third letter M is absent, and we have the fourth letter L correct. But there is another L in the third position? Then the feedback for ""dimly"" should show that L is in the word but in the wrong position? Or if it was in the third position and we guessed M, that wouldn't show? Actually, feedback for the third position was M, which was not in the word. The L in the fourth was correct. There's no indication of the extra L at position 3 because we didn't guess it. So ""dilly"" is possible.

  But note: if the secret word were ""dilly"", then the third letter is L. However, we already know that L is in the word (at position 4), so having L in position 3 as well would mean we have duplicate L. But how would the feedback react? When we guessed ""toils"", which had L in the fourth position and it was correct, but no additional L. So if the word has double L, then when we guess a word with one L in the correct position, the other L would not be indicated? Actually, if a letter appears multiple times, each guess is assessed independently.

  As per Wordle rules, if a letter appears multiple times in the secret word, and you guess that letter once, you get feedback for that one occurrence. If you guess it in the correct position, you get a ✓. If you guess it in a wrong position but it appears elsewhere, you get a -. If you guess fewer than the number in the secret, only the best matches count? So the feedback might not reveal duplicates.

  But in this case, for ""dilly"", in guess 3 ""dimly"": the secret word has L at position 3 and 4. We guessed L only at position 4 (correct). For position 3, we guessed M (absent). So no feedback would indicate that there is an L at position 3.

  Similarly, in guess 2: ""toils"" had no third position L, so no indication.

  Therefore, ""dilly"" is a possibility.

Other words? 

  - ""Dicey"": but has C and E -> eliminated.
  - ""Digit"": has G and T, but T eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""Dinky"": D I N K Y -> N eliminated -> invalid.
  - ""Dippy"": D I P P Y -> but ends with PY? No, it must end with LY? The last two are PY, not LY. So not matching the pattern.

  In our pattern, the word must be DI?LY, so the last two are LY, so the fifth letter is Y and the fourth is L.

  So possible words: 
      ""DILLY"" (with L in third position)
      ""DIGLY""? Not a word.
      ""DIHLY""? No.
      ""DIKLY""? No.
      ""DIPLY""? Not a word.
      ""DIZZY""? Ends with ZY -> invalid.

  Another one: ""DIVLY""? Not a word.

  ""DIZZY"" is not ending with LY.

  How about ""DAILY""? But A is eliminated -> invalid.

  ""DOILY""? But O is eliminated -> invalid.

  So the only common word I can think of is ""dilly"".

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""dilly"".

But to confirm, we can guess ""dilly"". However, we have 6 tries so far and we are at the third guess? Actually, we have made three guesses: crane, toils, dimly. So next is the fourth guess.

If we guess ""dilly"", we might win.

But let me see if there are other possibilities. 

  What about words with other letters? Such as ""DIULY""? Not a word.

  Or ""DIGLY"": not a word.

  Or ""DIWLY"": no.

So it seems ""dilly"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""dilly"".

But note: the available letters include B, F, G, H, etc., but no common words.

Another possibility: ""Filly"" but starts with F, not D -> not D.

We need the word to start with ""DI"" and end with ""Y"", fourth letter L.

So only ""dilly"" comes to mind.

Thus, we'll guess ""dilly"".

But we must make sure it doesn't violate eliminated letters. ""Dilly"": D, I, L, L, Y. Eliminated letters are C,R,A,N,E,T,O,S,M. None of these are in ""dilly"", so valid.

So guess is ""dilly"".### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Feedback Recap**:
   - **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent (`x`).  
     → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E.
   - **Guess 2: ""toils""** → 
     - T and O absent (`x`) → Add T, O to eliminated letters.
     - I present but wrong position (`-`) → Secret word contains I, but not in position 3.
     - L correct in position 4 (`✓`) → **4th letter is confirmed as L**.
     - S absent (`x`) → Add S to eliminated letters.
     → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S.
   - **Guess 3: ""dimly""** → 
     - D correct in position 1 (`✓`) → **1st letter is D**.
     - I correct in position 2 (`✓`) → **2nd letter is I**.
     - M absent (`x`) → Add M to eliminated letters.
     - L correct in position 4 (`✓`) → Confirms L in position 4 (already known).
     - Y correct in position 5 (`✓`) → **5th letter is Y**.
     → **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S, M.  
     → **Secret word pattern**: D I _ L Y (only position 3 missing).

2. **Current Constraints**:
   - **Pattern**: `D I _ L Y`
   - Position 3 must be a letter **not eliminated**: Available options: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
   - **Guesses must exclude**: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, S, M.
   - Since the secret word contains D, I, L, Y with no duplicates indicated in feedback, position 3 should ideally be a **new letter** for maximum information, though duplicates are still possible.

3. **Possible Words**:
   - Common English words fitting `D I _ L Y`:
     - ""**DILLY**"" (D I L L Y) → Valid word. Position 3: L (not eliminated).  
       → Ens L is duplicated? Feedback didn't rule it out.
     - **No other common words exist**. Alternatives like ""DIGLY"", ""DIKLY"", or ""DIPLY"" are invalid/obscure. Words like ""DAILY"" or ""DOILY"" contain eliminated letters (A, O).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - ""**DILLY**"" is the **only viable common word** matching the pattern and constraints.
   - If correct, this will win the game. If incorrect, the feedback on L will help identify duplicates or alternatives (though unlikely given available letters).",Guess 4: dilly -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
