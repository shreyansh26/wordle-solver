We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids duplicates to maximize information.
 Common starting words include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""SLATE"" as it has common letters: S, L, A, T, E.

 So, my first guess will be: SLATE

We have feedback from the first guess: ""slate"" gave S(x), L(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)
 Interpretation:
 - E is in the word but not in the last position (since we guessed E in the 5th position and it's wrong position).
 - S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position. Also, it does not contain S, L, A, T.

 Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We need to make a new guess that:
   - Does not contain S, L, A, T (since they are absent)
   - Must include E, but not at the 5th position? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but in the wrong position (we put it at the 5th). So the word has E in position 1,2,3, or 4? But note: we don't know yet. However, we can avoid putting E in the 5th.

 Also, we know the word is 5 letters and E is one of them. We need to consider common letters.

 We know the missing letters: S, L, A, T. So we should avoid these.

 Let me think of common vowels and consonants. We have E already. Other common vowels: I, O, U (but U is less common). Consonants: R, N, C, etc.

 A good second guess might include E and try other common letters not in {S,L,A,T}.

 Also, note: the feedback tells us about the positions. Since we have E present but misplaced, we can put E in a different position.

 Consider the word ""CRANE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess), so we cannot use A. Similarly, ""SLATE"" had A and T which are out.

 Let me think of words without S,L,A,T that contain E and other common letters.

 Some options: 
   - ""RINCE"" ? Not a word.
   - ""PRICE"": P, R, I, C, E -> this has E at the end? But we cannot put E at the end? 
     Wait: the feedback doesn't say that E cannot be at the end? Actually, our first guess had E at the end and it was wrong position. That means in the secret word, E is not at the end (position 5). However, it might be in the middle. So we can put E in positions 1-4.

 But note: if we put E in position 5 again, that would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 5 for E.

 Therefore, for the next guess, we should put E in one of positions 1-4.

 Possible words: 
   - ""CREPE"" -> but we have two E's? And also, we have R and P. But note: we don't know about R, P, and C. Also, we have to avoid S,L,A,T.

 Alternatively, let's consider ""PIECE"" -> has two E's? Actually, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? But in the rules, duplicates are allowed? However, the feedback might not explicitly tell duplicates? We'll assume it tells per occurrence? Actually, the example doesn't show duplicates. Let me recall: the secret word was BRISK and guess was STORM -> S was marked with (-) even though there's only one S? Actually in STORM, the S is the first letter and in BRISK, S is the fourth? So no duplicate issue.

 Without knowing if duplicates are allowed, we should avoid duplicates for now? However, we have no information about duplicates. So let's try a word without duplicates.

 We need a word that has E and avoids S,L,A,T.

 Let me list common letters: E, R, I, C, N, D, O, etc.

 A good word might be ""CREPE"", but that has E at the end? We need to avoid E at the end. So not position 5.

 Another idea: ""CRONE""? But note: O is a vowel. But we don't know if O is present. However, we can try. But ""CRONE"" has E at the end? Position? C(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> E is at the end again. We should avoid that.

 We want E not at position 5.

 How about ""CREPT"": C,R,E,P,T -> but T was in the first guess and was absent! (T(x) in the first feedback) so we cannot use T.

 So we must avoid letters that are absent: S,L,A,T.

 Therefore, T is out.

 What about ""PRICE""? P,R,I,C,E -> E is at the end? Position 5. We want to avoid E at position 5.

 We can rearrange: but we need a word that has E at non-5th position.

 Try: ""PERCH"" -> but H? Let me check: PERCH is 5 letters? P,E,R,C,H -> yes. And E is at position 2? Also, it doesn't contain S,L,A,T.

 But note: we have E at position 2? That might be okay.

 But we can also try words with E at position 1? Like ""EERIE""? But duplicate E's? And also not common letters? Let me avoid duplicates.

 Alternatively: ""ROUGE""? O is unknown, U and G are common? But E at 5th again? No: R,O,U,G,E -> E at 5th? We don't want E at 5th.

 We must have E in one of the first four positions.

 How about ""URINE""? U,R,I,N,E -> E at the end? Position 5. Not good.

 How about ""ENDUE""? E at the start? But then we have D,U,E? And we don't know about D and U. Also, the word ENDUE: E(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5)? Two E's? And E at both 1 and 5? But we want to avoid position 5.

 Alternatively: ""OPINE""? O(1),P(2),I(3),N(4),E(5) -> again E at 5.

 I realize there are many words that end with E. We need to find one that doesn't.

 How about ""MEDIC""? M,E,D,I,C -> E at position 2. 
 Also, M, D, I, C are not in the forbidden list? Yes, forbidden letters are S,L,A,T.

 So: M, E, D, I, C -> all allowed.

 Check if ""medic"" is a word? Yes.

 Another alternative: ""DRIVE""? D,R,I,V,E -> E at the end? Position 5. Not good.

 How about ""CRIED""? C,R,I,E,D -> E at position 4? That's acceptable. But C,R,I,E,D -> avoids S,L,A,T. And E is not at position 5.

 Another option: ""NICHE"" -> E at end? Bad.

 After considering, let me choose ""MEDIC"": because it has E at position 2 and avoids forbidden letters.

 But note: we are going to get feedback on the positions of M, D, I, C as well as E (but E we know is present but not in position 5, and we're putting it in position 2).

 We might get information about the position of E? If E is in the word and we put it in position 2, then if the secret word has E in position 2, it will be ✓, else if it's elsewhere it will be -. Or if the secret word has E in position 2, then we'll get ✓ for E? But if it doesn't, then we'll get - meaning E is elsewhere? Actually, the feedback for E could be:

   - If the secret word has E in position 2, then we get ✓ for E? 
   - If the secret word has E in position 1,3, or4, then we get - for E? (since it's in the word but wrong position)

 So we can learn about E's position.

 Also, we will learn about M, D, I, C.

 Therefore, I choose ""MEDIC"".

After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""slate"" (S✗, L✗, A✗, T✗, E-)—here's my analysis:

1. **Key deductions**:
   - E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since its feedback was ""-"", meaning misplaced).
   - S, L, A, T are **not** in the secret word (all ✗).
   - The secret word includes E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

2. **Strategy for next guess**:
   - Must include E (avoided at position 5).
   - Exclude S, L, A, T completely.
   - Prioritize common unused consonants/vowels (like R, I, N, C, D, M) to maximize information.
   - Test E in position 2 to efficiently probe its location.

Selected **MEDIC** (M, E, D, I, C):
- E in position 2 tests for correct placement.
- D, I, M, C are new untested letters.
- Avoids all forbidden letters and positions.

 We want E not at position 5.

 How about ""CREPT"": C,R,E,P,T -> but T was in the first guess and was absent! (T(x) in the first feedback) so we cannot use T.

 So we must avoid letters that are absent: S,L,A,T.

 Therefore, T is out.

 What about ""PRICE""? P,R,I,C,E -> E is at the end? Position 5. We want to avoid E at position 5.

 We can rearrange: but we need a word that has E at non-5th position.

 Try: ""PERCH"" -> but H? Let me check: PERCH is 5 letters? P,E,R,C,H -> yes. And E is at position 2? Also, it doesn't contain S,L,A,T.

 But note: we have E at position 2? That might be okay.

 But we can also try words with E at position 1? Like ""EERIE""? But duplicate E's? And also not common letters? Let me avoid duplicates.

 Alternatively: ""ROUGE""? O is unknown, U and G are common? But E at 5th again? No: R,O,U,G,E -> E at 5th? We don't want E at 5th.

 We must have E in one of the first four positions.

 How about ""URINE""? U,R,I,N,E -> E at the end? Position 5. Not good.

 How about ""ENDUE""? E at the start? But then we have D,U,E? And we don't know about D and U. Also, the word ENDUE: E(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5)? Two E's? And E at both 1 and 5? But we want to avoid position 5.

 Alternatively: ""OPINE""? O(1),P(2),I(3),N(4),E(5) -> again E at 5.

 I realize there are many words that end with E. We need to find one that doesn't.

 How about ""MEDIC""? M,E,D,I,C -> E at position 2. 
 Also, M, D, I, C are not in the forbidden list? Yes, forbidden letters are S,L,A,T.

 So: M, E, D, I, C -> all allowed.

 Check if ""medic"" is a word? Yes.

 Another alternative: ""DRIVE""? D,R,I,V,E -> E at the end? Position 5. Not good.

 How about ""CRIED""? C,R,I,E,D -> E at position 4? That's acceptable. But C,R,I,E,D -> avoids S,L,A,T. And E is not at position 5.

 Another option: ""NICHE"" -> E at end? Bad.

 After considering, let me choose ""MEDIC"": because it has E at position 2 and avoids forbidden letters.

 But note: we are going to get feedback on the positions of M, D, I, C as well as E (but E we know is present but not in position 5, and we're putting it in position 2).

 We might get information about the position of E? If E is in the word and we put it in position 2, then if the secret word has E in position 2, it will be ✓, else if it's elsewhere it will be -. Or if the secret word has E in position 2, then we'll get ✓ for E? But if it doesn't, then we'll get - meaning E is elsewhere? Actually, the feedback for E could be:

   - If the secret word has E in position 2, then we get ✓ for E? 
   - If the secret word has E in position 1,3, or4, then we get - for E? (since it's in the word but wrong position)

 So we can learn about E's position.

 Also, we will learn about M, D, I, C.

 Therefore, I choose ""MEDIC"".

<guess>medic</guess>After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""slate"" (S✗, L✗, A✗, T✗, E-)—here's my analysis:

1. **Key deductions**:
   - E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since its feedback was ""-"", meaning misplaced).
   - S, L, A, T are **not** in the secret word (all ✗).
   - The secret word includes E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

2. **Strategy for next guess**:
   - Must include E (avoided at position 5).
   - Exclude S, L, A, T completely.
   - Prioritize common unused consonants/vowels (like R, I, N, C, D, M) to maximize information.
   - Test E in position 2 to efficiently probe its location.

Selected **MEDIC** (M, E, D, I, C):
- E in position 2 tests for correct placement.
- D, I, M, C are new untested letters.
- Avoids all forbidden letters and positions.

We have two feedbacks:
From Guess 1: slate -> S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Meaning: E is present but not in the 5th position. S, L, A, T are absent.

From Guess 2: medic -> M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)
Meaning: 
- E is present but not in the 2nd position (since we got - for E in position 2). 
- I is present but not in the 4th position (since we put I at position 4 and got -). 
- M, D, C are absent.

So, overall:
- Absent letters: S, L, A, T, M, D, C
- Present letters: E, I (but E not in position 2 or 5, I not in position 4)

We need to find a word that uses E and I, and possibly other letters not in the absent list.

Also, note the positions:
For E: it must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be in 2 or 5).
But wait, in the first guess, slate had E in position 5 and that was wrong position. Since then we know E is not in 5. In the second guess, medic had E in position 2, which was also wrong position. So E is in the word but not in 2 or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, for I: we placed it in position 4 in medic and it was wrong position, but it is present. So I could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5? We don't know, so we have to consider.

But note: E must be in one of 1,3,4 and I must be in one of the positions but not 4 (since that's what we know from Guess 2).

We know the word has 5 letters: 
Position 1: cannot be S,L,A,T,M,D,C (absent letters) and must be one of E, I or a new letter? But E in position 1 is possible.

Now, we have to form a word with E and I. The absent letters are: S,L,A,T,M,D,C. So available letters: E, I, B,F,G,H,J,K,N,O,P,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We have limited tries left: 4 guesses remaining (since 2 used).

We should aim to use common letters and avoid absent ones.

Let me try to think of words with E and I, avoiding S,L,A,T,M,D,C.

Some options:
- ""PIECE"": but has two E's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but let's avoid for now? Also, E appears twice? Additionally, C is absent? But we know C is absent so we cannot use C? In ""piece"", there is C? So no, because C is absent.
- ""FIERY"": F,I,E,R,Y -> positions: F1, I2, E3, R4, Y5. This uses F and R and Y. Also, E is at position 3 (which is allowed) and I at position 2. We don't know about I at position 2? So we can test.
- ""NEIGH"": N,E,I,G,H -> positions: N1, E2, I3, G4, H5. But E at position 2: we know E cannot be at position 2? Because in guess 2, we had E at 2 and it was wrong. So we cannot put E at 2 again.

So we must avoid putting E at position 2? Yes.

In ""FIERY"", E is at position 3? That's okay. And I at position 2? That's okay.

Another word: ""QUEEN""? But duplicates? And Q and U? And E at positions 3 and 4? Position 1: Q, position 2: U, position 3: E, position 4: E, position 5: N. But E at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is allowed? But we have two E's? And Q and U are available.

But we also have to consider that E cannot be in position 2 or 5? Here E is at 3 and 4? So okay? But let me check if Q and U are acceptable? Yes, because they are not in the absent list.

But ""QUEEN"" has duplicate E? And we don't know if there are duplicates? However, in the feedback system, duplicates might be treated separately? For example, if the secret word has two E's? Then guessing E in a position that has E would get ✓ or - accordingly. But in our case, we don't know? But we know there is at least one E.

Alternatively, ""PINEY"": P,I,N,E,Y -> positions: P1, I2, N3, E4, Y5. This uses P, N, E, Y. And E at position 4? That is allowed (since not 2 or 5), and I at position 2? We don't know about I at 2? So we can try.

But note: in Guess 2, medic, we had I at position 4 and it was marked - meaning present but wrong position. So I cannot be at position 4? But we are putting I at position 2 now? Therefore, if the secret word has I at position 2, we get ✓ for I? If not, then we get - meaning I is somewhere else? Either way, we get information.

Similarly, for E, putting at position 4? We know E must be in 1,3, or4? So if we put E at 4, then if E is at 4 we get ✓; if E is at 1 or 3, we might get -? But wait: if E is at 1 in the secret word, will putting E at 4 still yield -? Yes, because the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.

So let's compare options:

Option 1: FIERY (F,I,E,R,Y)
  Positions: F1, I2, E3, R4, Y5
  We test if E is at position 3? And I at position 2? And R is a new common letter.

Option 2: PINEY (P,I,N,E,Y)
  Positions: P1, I2, N3, E4, Y5
  Tests: I at 2, E at 4.

Both seem reasonable. But note: we might also consider words with E at position 1? Because that is a possibility.

For example: ""EERIE""? Duplicates? Let's avoid duplicates.

""ENNUI""? E1,N2,N3,U4,I5? But I at position 5? And duplicates N? Also, we have two N's? But we need to know if N is present? Also, E at 1: which is a possibility.

But we don't know about N? So we can test.

However, ""ENNUI"" might not be common. Let me choose a more common word.

""ELDER""? But D is absent? From Guess 2: D is absent? So we cannot use D? So ""elder"" is invalid.

How about ""EMBER""? E,M,B,E,R? But M is absent? So no.

""OWRIE""? Not common.

Perhaps ""EKRIS""? Not a word.

Let me consider one with E at 1: ""ENDOW""? But D and O? D is absent? So no.

""ENVOY"": E1,N2,V3,O4,Y5? This avoids absent letters? Absent: S,L,A,T,M,D,C? So D is absent? But in ""envoys"" we have V,O,Y? And E at 1? And N? 
""ENVOY"" is a word. But note: it does not contain the letter I? But we know the word has I? So we must include I? Otherwise, if we guess without I, then we might miss it? But we know I is present? So we must include I in the guess? Why? Because the word has I? So we cannot ignore it.

Yes, we know the secret word has I (because in Guess 2, medic, I got - meaning it is in the word). So we must include both E and I in our next guess? Otherwise we might not get enough information.

Therefore, guesses must include E and I? Because they are present? And we need to locate them.

So words must include E and I? Yes.

Therefore, FIERY and PINEY are both valid? And they include E and I.

Additionally, we need to test positions for E and I.

In PINEY: I at 2, E at 4. We know that I cannot be at position 4? Because it was in Guess 2 at 4 and marked as -. So putting I at 2 now: 
- If I is at 2, then ✓? 
- If not, then we get - meaning I is somewhere else? But we don't know where.

Similarly, E at 4: 
- If E is at 4, then ✓? 
- If E is at 1 or 3, then we get - because it's present but in wrong position? But if E is at 1, we put at 4: so -? Similarly for 3.

Another option: ""INNED""? But E at 5? But we know E cannot be at 5? And also D is absent? So no.

""FINER"": F,I,N,E,R -> positions: F1,I2,N3,E4,R5? This has E at 4? Also, avoids absent letters? Yes: absent letters: S,L,A,T,M,D,C? So F,I,N,E,R are not in absent? But note E at 4? And I at 2? Same as PINEY? But R at 5.

But ""FINER"" is valid? Yes.

Compared to FIERY: which has E at 3 and R at 4? And Y at 5.

We might also consider ""WIPER"": W,I,P,E,R -> positions: W1,I2,P3,E4,R5? But same as FINER? But with W and P? We don't know if W or P is common? Or R.

Perhaps it's better to test new letters? For example, in FIERY we test F,R,Y? In PINEY we test P,N,Y? In FINER we test F,N,R? 

But R was in FIERY? Let me make a decision.

Alternatively: ""NEVER"" has two E's? And E at 1 and 4? Position: E1? Allowed. Then E4? Also allowed? But we don't know if duplicates? And V is available? But ""never"" has E twice? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Moreover, we have I? We must include I? So ""never"" doesn't include I? So no.

Therefore, I'll choose between FIERY and PINEY.

Let me pick FIERY because it tests E at position 3? In case E is at 3? And we haven't tested position 3 for E? Similarly, I at 2? And we haven't tested I at 2? Also, R at 4? And Y at 5? So it avoids positions we already know are wrong for E? But wait, we know E is not at 2 or 5? But at 3? We haven't tested.

Note: In the first guess, we had slate which had no position 3 E? So we haven't tested position 3 for E? So that's new.

Similarly, PINEY tests E at 4? Also new? Because we haven't tested E at 4? Only at 2 and 5? So both are new positions? Position 3 (FIERY) and position 4 (PINEY).

But we also have to consider that for I: in PINEY we put I at 2? Which we haven't tested? And in FIERY also I at 2? Same for both? So that's same.

Therefore, FIERY is F,I,E,R,Y? And PINEY is P,I,N,E,Y.

Both are fine. I'll go with FIERY because it uses R? Which is common? Or Y? 

Actually, let me search for words without Y? Because Y is less common? Maybe? But we have to use available letters.

But I'll go with FIERY.

So next guess: FIERY

But note: FIERY is 5 letters? And valid? Yes.

Let me confirm spelling? F-I-E-R-Y? Yes.

From Guess 2: medic -> M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)
Meaning: 
- E is present but not in the 2nd position (since we got - for E in position 2). 
- I is present but not in the 4th position (since we put I at position 4 and got -). 
- M, D, C are absent.

So, overall:
- Absent letters: S, L, A, T, M, D, C
- Present letters: E, I (but E not in position 2 or 5, I not in position 4)

We need to find a word that uses E and I, and possibly other letters not in the absent list.

Also, note the positions:
For E: it must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be in 2 or 5).
But wait, in the first guess, slate had E in position 5 and that was wrong position. Since then we know E is not in 5. In the second guess, medic had E in position 2, which was also wrong position. So E is in the word but not in 2 or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, for I: we placed it in position 4 in medic and it was wrong position, but it is present. So I could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5? We don't know, so we have to consider.

But note: E must be in one of 1,3,4 and I must be in one of the positions but not 4 (since that's what we know from Guess 2).

We know the word has 5 letters: 
Position 1: cannot be S,L,A,T,M,D,C (absent letters) and must be one of E, I or a new letter? But E in position 1 is possible.

Now, we have to form a word with E and I. The absent letters are: S,L,A,T,M,D,C. So available letters: E, I, B,F,G,H,J,K,N,O,P,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We have limited tries left: 4 guesses remaining (since 2 used).

We should aim to use common letters and avoid absent ones.

Let me try to think of words with E and I, avoiding S,L,A,T,M,D,C.

Some options:
- ""PIECE"": but has two E's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but let's avoid for now? Also, E appears twice? Additionally, C is absent? But we know C is absent so we cannot use C? In ""piece"", there is C? So no, because C is absent.
- ""FIERY"": F,I,E,R,Y -> positions: F1, I2, E3, R4, Y5. This uses F and R and Y. Also, E is at position 3 (which is allowed) and I at position 2. We don't know about I at position 2? So we can test.
- ""NEIGH"": N,E,I,G,H -> positions: N1, E2, I3, G4, H5. But E at position 2: we know E cannot be at position 2? Because in guess 2, we had E at 2 and it was wrong. So we cannot put E at 2 again.

So we must avoid putting E at position 2? Yes.

In ""FIERY"", E is at position 3? That's okay. And I at position 2? That's okay.

Another word: ""QUEEN""? But duplicates? And Q and U? And E at positions 3 and 4? Position 1: Q, position 2: U, position 3: E, position 4: E, position 5: N. But E at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is allowed? But we have two E's? And Q and U are available.

But we also have to consider that E cannot be in position 2 or 5? Here E is at 3 and 4? So okay? But let me check if Q and U are acceptable? Yes, because they are not in the absent list.

But ""QUEEN"" has duplicate E? And we don't know if there are duplicates? However, in the feedback system, duplicates might be treated separately? For example, if the secret word has two E's? Then guessing E in a position that has E would get ✓ or - accordingly. But in our case, we don't know? But we know there is at least one E.

Alternatively, ""PINEY"": P,I,N,E,Y -> positions: P1, I2, N3, E4, Y5. This uses P, N, E, Y. And E at position 4? That is allowed (since not 2 or 5), and I at position 2? We don't know about I at 2? So we can try.

But note: in Guess 2, medic, we had I at position 4 and it was marked - meaning present but wrong position. So I cannot be at position 4? But we are putting I at position 2 now? Therefore, if the secret word has I at position 2, we get ✓ for I? If not, then we get - meaning I is somewhere else? Either way, we get information.

Similarly, for E, putting at position 4? We know E must be in 1,3, or4? So if we put E at 4, then if E is at 4 we get ✓; if E is at 1 or 3, we might get -? But wait: if E is at 1 in the secret word, will putting E at 4 still yield -? Yes, because the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.

So let's compare options:

Option 1: FIERY (F,I,E,R,Y)
  Positions: F1, I2, E3, R4, Y5
  We test if E is at position 3? And I at position 2? And R is a new common letter.

Option 2: PINEY (P,I,N,E,Y)
  Positions: P1, I2, N3, E4, Y5
  Tests: I at 2, E at 4.

Both seem reasonable. But note: we might also consider words with E at position 1? Because that is a possibility.

For example: ""EERIE""? Duplicates? Let's avoid duplicates.

""ENNUI""? E1,N2,N3,U4,I5? But I at position 5? And duplicates N? Also, we have two N's? But we need to know if N is present? Also, E at 1: which is a possibility.

But we don't know about N? So we can test.

However, ""ENNUI"" might not be common. Let me choose a more common word.

""ELDER""? But D is absent? From Guess 2: D is absent? So we cannot use D? So ""elder"" is invalid.

How about ""EMBER""? E,M,B,E,R? But M is absent? So no.

""OWRIE""? Not common.

Perhaps ""EKRIS""? Not a word.

Let me consider one with E at 1: ""ENDOW""? But D and O? D is absent? So no.

""ENVOY"": E1,N2,V3,O4,Y5? This avoids absent letters? Absent: S,L,A,T,M,D,C? So D is absent? But in ""envoys"" we have V,O,Y? And E at 1? And N? 
""ENVOY"" is a word. But note: it does not contain the letter I? But we know the word has I? So we must include I? Otherwise, if we guess without I, then we might miss it? But we know I is present? So we must include I in the guess? Why? Because the word has I? So we cannot ignore it.

Yes, we know the secret word has I (because in Guess 2, medic, I got - meaning it is in the word). So we must include both E and I in our next guess? Otherwise we might not get enough information.

Therefore, guesses must include E and I? Because they are present? And we need to locate them.

So words must include E and I? Yes.

Therefore, FIERY and PINEY are both valid? And they include E and I.

Additionally, we need to test positions for E and I.

In PINEY: I at 2, E at 4. We know that I cannot be at position 4? Because it was in Guess 2 at 4 and marked as -. So putting I at 2 now: 
- If I is at 2, then ✓? 
- If not, then we get - meaning I is somewhere else? But we don't know where.

Similarly, E at 4: 
- If E is at 4, then ✓? 
- If E is at 1 or 3, then we get - because it's present but in wrong position? But if E is at 1, we put at 4: so -? Similarly for 3.

Another option: ""INNED""? But E at 5? But we know E cannot be at 5? And also D is absent? So no.

""FINER"": F,I,N,E,R -> positions: F1,I2,N3,E4,R5? This has E at 4? Also, avoids absent letters? Yes: absent letters: S,L,A,T,M,D,C? So F,I,N,E,R are not in absent? But note E at 4? And I at 2? Same as PINEY? But R at 5.

But ""FINER"" is valid? Yes.

Compared to FIERY: which has E at 3 and R at 4? And Y at 5.

We might also consider ""WIPER"": W,I,P,E,R -> positions: W1,I2,P3,E4,R5? But same as FINER? But with W and P? We don't know if W or P is common? Or R.

Perhaps it's better to test new letters? For example, in FIERY we test F,R,Y? In PINEY we test P,N,Y? In FINER we test F,N,R? 

But R was in FIERY? Let me make a decision.

Alternatively: ""NEVER"" has two E's? And E at 1 and 4? Position: E1? Allowed. Then E4? Also allowed? But we don't know if duplicates? And V is available? But ""never"" has E twice? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Moreover, we have I? We must include I? So ""never"" doesn't include I? So no.

Therefore, I'll choose between FIERY and PINEY.

Let me pick FIERY because it tests E at position 3? In case E is at 3? And we haven't tested position 3 for E? Similarly, I at 2? And we haven't tested I at 2? Also, R at 4? And Y at 5? So it avoids positions we already know are wrong for E? But wait, we know E is not at 2 or 5? But at 3? We haven't tested.

Note: In the first guess, we had slate which had no position 3 E? So we haven't tested position 3 for E? So that's new.

Similarly, PINEY tests E at 4? Also new? Because we haven't tested E at 4? Only at 2 and 5? So both are new positions? Position 3 (FIERY) and position 4 (PINEY).

But we also have to consider that for I: in PINEY we put I at 2? Which we haven't tested? And in FIERY also I at 2? Same for both? So that's same.

Therefore, FIERY is F,I,E,R,Y? And PINEY is P,I,N,E,Y.

Both are fine. I'll go with FIERY because it uses R? Which is common? Or Y? 

Actually, let me search for words without Y? Because Y is less common? Maybe? But we have to use available letters.

But I'll go with FIERY.

So next guess: FIERY

But note: FIERY is 5 letters? And valid? Yes.

Let me confirm spelling? F-I-E-R-Y? Yes.

So:

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids duplicates to maximize information.
 Common starting words include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""SLATE"" as it has common letters: S, L, A, T, E.

 So, my first guess will be: SLATE

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""slate"" gave S(x), L(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)
 Interpretation:
 - E is in the word but not in the last position (since we guessed E in the 5th position and it's wrong position).
 - S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position. Also, it does not contain S, L, A, T.

 Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We need to make a new guess that:
   - Does not contain S, L, A, T (since they are absent)
   - Must include E, but not at the 5th position? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but in the wrong position (we put it at the 5th). So the word has E in position 1,2,3, or 4? But note: we don't know yet. However, we can avoid putting E in the 5th.

 Also, we know the word is 5 letters and E is one of them. We need to consider common letters.

 We know the missing letters: S, L, A, T. So we should avoid these.

 Let me think of common vowels and consonants. We have E already. Other common vowels: I, O, U (but U is less common). Consonants: R, N, C, etc.

 A good second guess might include E and try other common letters not in {S,L,A,T}.

 Also, note: the feedback tells us about the positions. Since we have E present but misplaced, we can put E in a different position.

 Consider the word ""CRANE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess), so we cannot use A. Similarly, ""SLATE"" had A and T which are out.

 Let me think of words without S,L,A,T that contain E and other common letters.

 Some options: 
   - ""RINCE"" ? Not a word.
   - ""PRICE"": P, R, I, C, E -> this has E at the end? But we cannot put E at the end? 
     Wait: the feedback doesn't say that E cannot be at the end? Actually, our first guess had E at the end and it was wrong position. That means in the secret word, E is not at the end (position 5). However, it might be in the middle. So we can put E in positions 1-4.

 But note: if we put E in position 5 again, that would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 5 for E.

 Therefore, for the next guess, we should put E in one of positions 1-4.

 Possible words: 
   - ""CREPE"" -> but we have two E's? And also, we have R and P. But note: we don't know about R, P, and C. Also, we have to avoid S,L,A,T.

 Alternatively, let's consider ""PIECE"" -> has two E's? Actually, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? But in the rules, duplicates are allowed? However, the feedback might not explicitly tell duplicates? We'll assume it tells per occurrence? Actually, the example doesn't show duplicates. Let me recall: the secret word was BRISK and guess was STORM -> S was marked with (-) even though there's only one S? Actually in STORM, the S is the first letter and in BRISK, S is the fourth? So no duplicate issue.

 Without knowing if duplicates are allowed, we should avoid duplicates for now? However, we have no information about duplicates. So let's try a word without duplicates.

 We need a word that has E and avoids S,L,A,T.

 Let me list common letters: E, R, I, C, N, D, O, etc.

 A good word might be ""CREPE"", but that has E at the end? We need to avoid E at the end. So not position 5.

 Another idea: ""CRONE""? But note: O is a vowel. But we don't know if O is present. However, we can try. But ""CRONE"" has E at the end? Position? C(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> E is at the end again. We should avoid that.

 We want E not at position 5.

 How about ""CREPT"": C,R,E,P,T -> but T was in the first guess and was absent! (T(x) in the first feedback) so we cannot use T.

 So we must avoid letters that are absent: S,L,A,T.

 Therefore, T is out.

 What about ""PRICE""? P,R,I,C,E -> E is at the end? Position 5. We want to avoid E at position 5.

 We can rearrange: but we need a word that has E at non-5th position.

 Try: ""PERCH"" -> but H? Let me check: PERCH is 5 letters? P,E,R,C,H -> yes. And E is at position 2? Also, it doesn't contain S,L,A,T.

 But note: we have E at position 2? That might be okay.

 But we can also try words with E at position 1? Like ""EERIE""? But duplicate E's? And also not common letters? Let me avoid duplicates.

 Alternatively: ""ROUGE""? O is unknown, U and G are common? But E at 5th again? No: R,O,U,G,E -> E at 5th? We don't want E at 5th.

 We must have E in one of the first four positions.

 How about ""URINE""? U,R,I,N,E -> E at the end? Position 5. Not good.

 How about ""ENDUE""? E at the start? But then we have D,U,E? And we don't know about D and U. Also, the word ENDUE: E(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5)? Two E's? And E at both 1 and 5? But we want to avoid position 5.

 Alternatively: ""OPINE""? O(1),P(2),I(3),N(4),E(5) -> again E at 5.

 I realize there are many words that end with E. We need to find one that doesn't.

 How about ""MEDIC""? M,E,D,I,C -> E at position 2. 
 Also, M, D, I, C are not in the forbidden list? Yes, forbidden letters are S,L,A,T.

 So: M, E, D, I, C -> all allowed.

 Check if ""medic"" is a word? Yes.

 Another alternative: ""DRIVE""? D,R,I,V,E -> E at the end? Position 5. Not good.

 How about ""CRIED""? C,R,I,E,D -> E at position 4? That's acceptable. But C,R,I,E,D -> avoids S,L,A,T. And E is not at position 5.

 Another option: ""NICHE"" -> E at end? Bad.

 After considering, let me choose ""MEDIC"": because it has E at position 2 and avoids forbidden letters.

 But note: we are going to get feedback on the positions of M, D, I, C as well as E (but E we know is present but not in position 5, and we're putting it in position 2).

 We might get information about the position of E? If E is in the word and we put it in position 2, then if the secret word has E in position 2, it will be ✓, else if it's elsewhere it will be -. Or if the secret word has E in position 2, then we'll get ✓ for E? But if it doesn't, then we'll get - meaning E is elsewhere? Actually, the feedback for E could be:

   - If the secret word has E in position 2, then we get ✓ for E? 
   - If the secret word has E in position 1,3, or4, then we get - for E? (since it's in the word but wrong position)

 So we can learn about E's position.

 Also, we will learn about M, D, I, C.

 Therefore, I choose ""MEDIC"".

<guess>medic</guess>After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""slate"" (S✗, L✗, A✗, T✗, E-)—here's my analysis:

1. **Key deductions**:
   - E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since its feedback was ""-"", meaning misplaced).
   - S, L, A, T are **not** in the secret word (all ✗).
   - The secret word includes E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

2. **Strategy for next guess**:
   - Must include E (avoided at position 5).
   - Exclude S, L, A, T completely.
   - Prioritize common unused consonants/vowels (like R, I, N, C, D, M) to maximize information.
   - Test E in position 2 to efficiently probe its location.

Selected **MEDIC** (M, E, D, I, C):
- E in position 2 tests for correct placement.
- D, I, M, C are new untested letters.
- Avoids all forbidden letters and positions.

<guess>medic</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two feedbacks:
From Guess 1: slate -> S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Meaning: E is present but not in the 5th position. S, L, A, T are absent.

From Guess 2: medic -> M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)
Meaning: 
- E is present but not in the 2nd position (since we got - for E in position 2). 
- I is present but not in the 4th position (since we put I at position 4 and got -). 
- M, D, C are absent.

So, overall:
- Absent letters: S, L, A, T, M, D, C
- Present letters: E, I (but E not in position 2 or 5, I not in position 4)

We need to find a word that uses E and I, and possibly other letters not in the absent list.

Also, note the positions:
For E: it must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be in 2 or 5).
But wait, in the first guess, slate had E in position 5 and that was wrong position. Since then we know E is not in 5. In the second guess, medic had E in position 2, which was also wrong position. So E is in the word but not in 2 or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, for I: we placed it in position 4 in medic and it was wrong position, but it is present. So I could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5? We don't know, so we have to consider.

But note: E must be in one of 1,3,4 and I must be in one of the positions but not 4 (since that's what we know from Guess 2).

We know the word has 5 letters: 
Position 1: cannot be S,L,A,T,M,D,C (absent letters) and must be one of E, I or a new letter? But E in position 1 is possible.

Now, we have to form a word with E and I. The absent letters are: S,L,A,T,M,D,C. So available letters: E, I, B,F,G,H,J,K,N,O,P,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We have limited tries left: 4 guesses remaining (since 2 used).

We should aim to use common letters and avoid absent ones.

Let me try to think of words with E and I, avoiding S,L,A,T,M,D,C.

Some options:
- ""PIECE"": but has two E's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but let's avoid for now? Also, E appears twice? Additionally, C is absent? But we know C is absent so we cannot use C? In ""piece"", there is C? So no, because C is absent.
- ""FIERY"": F,I,E,R,Y -> positions: F1, I2, E3, R4, Y5. This uses F and R and Y. Also, E is at position 3 (which is allowed) and I at position 2. We don't know about I at position 2? So we can test.
- ""NEIGH"": N,E,I,G,H -> positions: N1, E2, I3, G4, H5. But E at position 2: we know E cannot be at position 2? Because in guess 2, we had E at 2 and it was wrong. So we cannot put E at 2 again.

So we must avoid putting E at position 2? Yes.

In ""FIERY"", E is at position 3? That's okay. And I at position 2? That's okay.

Another word: ""QUEEN""? But duplicates? And Q and U? And E at positions 3 and 4? Position 1: Q, position 2: U, position 3: E, position 4: E, position 5: N. But E at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is allowed? But we have two E's? And Q and U are available.

But we also have to consider that E cannot be in position 2 or 5? Here E is at 3 and 4? So okay? But let me check if Q and U are acceptable? Yes, because they are not in the absent list.

But ""QUEEN"" has duplicate E? And we don't know if there are duplicates? However, in the feedback system, duplicates might be treated separately? For example, if the secret word has two E's? Then guessing E in a position that has E would get ✓ or - accordingly. But in our case, we don't know? But we know there is at least one E.

Alternatively, ""PINEY"": P,I,N,E,Y -> positions: P1, I2, N3, E4, Y5. This uses P, N, E, Y. And E at position 4? That is allowed (since not 2 or 5), and I at position 2? We don't know about I at 2? So we can try.

But note: in Guess 2, medic, we had I at position 4 and it was marked - meaning present but wrong position. So I cannot be at position 4? But we are putting I at position 2 now? Therefore, if the secret word has I at position 2, we get ✓ for I? If not, then we get - meaning I is somewhere else? Either way, we get information.

Similarly, for E, putting at position 4? We know E must be in 1,3, or4? So if we put E at 4, then if E is at 4 we get ✓; if E is at 1 or 3, we might get -? But wait: if E is at 1 in the secret word, will putting E at 4 still yield -? Yes, because the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.

So let's compare options:

Option 1: FIERY (F,I,E,R,Y)
  Positions: F1, I2, E3, R4, Y5
  We test if E is at position 3? And I at position 2? And R is a new common letter.

Option 2: PINEY (P,I,N,E,Y)
  Positions: P1, I2, N3, E4, Y5
  Tests: I at 2, E at 4.

Both seem reasonable. But note: we might also consider words with E at position 1? Because that is a possibility.

For example: ""EERIE""? Duplicates? Let's avoid duplicates.

""ENNUI""? E1,N2,N3,U4,I5? But I at position 5? And duplicates N? Also, we have two N's? But we need to know if N is present? Also, E at 1: which is a possibility.

But we don't know about N? So we can test.

However, ""ENNUI"" might not be common. Let me choose a more common word.

""ELDER""? But D is absent? From Guess 2: D is absent? So we cannot use D? So ""elder"" is invalid.

How about ""EMBER""? E,M,B,E,R? But M is absent? So no.

""OWRIE""? Not common.

Perhaps ""EKRIS""? Not a word.

Let me consider one with E at 1: ""ENDOW""? But D and O? D is absent? So no.

""ENVOY"": E1,N2,V3,O4,Y5? This avoids absent letters? Absent: S,L,A,T,M,D,C? So D is absent? But in ""envoys"" we have V,O,Y? And E at 1? And N? 
""ENVOY"" is a word. But note: it does not contain the letter I? But we know the word has I? So we must include I? Otherwise, if we guess without I, then we might miss it? But we know I is present? So we must include I in the guess? Why? Because the word has I? So we cannot ignore it.

Yes, we know the secret word has I (because in Guess 2, medic, I got - meaning it is in the word). So we must include both E and I in our next guess? Otherwise we might not get enough information.

Therefore, guesses must include E and I? Because they are present? And we need to locate them.

So words must include E and I? Yes.

Therefore, FIERY and PINEY are both valid? And they include E and I.

Additionally, we need to test positions for E and I.

In PINEY: I at 2, E at 4. We know that I cannot be at position 4? Because it was in Guess 2 at 4 and marked as -. So putting I at 2 now: 
- If I is at 2, then ✓? 
- If not, then we get - meaning I is somewhere else? But we don't know where.

Similarly, E at 4: 
- If E is at 4, then ✓? 
- If E is at 1 or 3, then we get - because it's present but in wrong position? But if E is at 1, we put at 4: so -? Similarly for 3.

Another option: ""INNED""? But E at 5? But we know E cannot be at 5? And also D is absent? So no.

""FINER"": F,I,N,E,R -> positions: F1,I2,N3,E4,R5? This has E at 4? Also, avoids absent letters? Yes: absent letters: S,L,A,T,M,D,C? So F,I,N,E,R are not in absent? But note E at 4? And I at 2? Same as PINEY? But R at 5.

But ""FINER"" is valid? Yes.

Compared to FIERY: which has E at 3 and R at 4? And Y at 5.

We might also consider ""WIPER"": W,I,P,E,R -> positions: W1,I2,P3,E4,R5? But same as FINER? But with W and P? We don't know if W or P is common? Or R.

Perhaps it's better to test new letters? For example, in FIERY we test F,R,Y? In PINEY we test P,N,Y? In FINER we test F,N,R? 

But R was in FIERY? Let me make a decision.

Alternatively: ""NEVER"" has two E's? And E at 1 and 4? Position: E1? Allowed. Then E4? Also allowed? But we don't know if duplicates? And V is available? But ""never"" has E twice? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Moreover, we have I? We must include I? So ""never"" doesn't include I? So no.

Therefore, I'll choose between FIERY and PINEY.

Let me pick FIERY because it tests E at position 3? In case E is at 3? And we haven't tested position 3 for E? Similarly, I at 2? And we haven't tested I at 2? Also, R at 4? And Y at 5? So it avoids positions we already know are wrong for E? But wait, we know E is not at 2 or 5? But at 3? We haven't tested.

Note: In the first guess, we had slate which had no position 3 E? So we haven't tested position 3 for E? So that's new.

Similarly, PINEY tests E at 4? Also new? Because we haven't tested E at 4? Only at 2 and 5? So both are new positions? Position 3 (FIERY) and position 4 (PINEY).

But we also have to consider that for I: in PINEY we put I at 2? Which we haven't tested? And in FIERY also I at 2? Same for both? So that's same.

Therefore, FIERY is F,I,E,R,Y? And PINEY is P,I,N,E,Y.

Both are fine. I'll go with FIERY because it uses R? Which is common? Or Y? 

Actually, let me search for words without Y? Because Y is less common? Maybe? But we have to use available letters.

But I'll go with FIERY.

So next guess: FIERY

But note: FIERY is 5 letters? And valid? Yes.

Let me confirm spelling? F-I-E-R-Y? Yes.

So:

Also, it does not contain S, L, A, T.\n\n Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions.\n\n We need to make a new guess that:\n   - Does not contain S, L, A, T (since they are absent)\n   - Must include E, but not at the 5th position? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but in the wrong position (we put it at the 5th). So the word has E in position 1,2,3, or 4? But note: we don\'t know yet. However, we can avoid putting E in the 5th.\n\n Also, we know the word is 5 letters and E is one of them. We need to consider common letters.\n\n We know the missing letters: S, L, A, T. So we should avoid these.\n\n Let me think of common vowels and consonants. We have E already. Other common vowels: I, O, U (but U is less common). Consonants: R, N, C, etc.\n\n A good second guess might include E and try other common letters not in {S,L,A,T}.\n\n Also, note: the feedback tells us about the positions. Since we have E present but misplaced, we can put E in a different position.\n\n Consider the word ""CRANE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess), so we cannot use A. Similarly, ""SLATE"" had A and T which are out.\n\n Let me think of words without S,L,A,T that contain E and other common letters.\n\n Some options: \n   - ""RINCE"" ? Not a word.\n   - ""PRICE"": P, R, I, C, E -> this has E at the end? But we cannot put E at the end? \n     Wait: the feedback doesn\'t say that E cannot be at the end? Actually, our first guess had E at the end and it was wrong position. That means in the secret word, E is not at the end (position 5). However, it might be in the middle. So we can put E in positions 1-4.\n\n But note: if we put E in position 5 again, that would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid position 5 for E.\n\n Therefore, for the next guess, we should put E in one of positions 1-4.\n\n Possible words: \n   - ""CREPE"" -> but we have two E\'s? And also, we have R and P. But note: we don\'t know about R, P, and C. Also, we have to avoid S,L,A,T.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s consider ""PIECE"" -> has two E\'s? Actually, we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters? But in the rules, duplicates are allowed? However, the feedback might not explicitly tell duplicates? We\'ll assume it tells per occurrence? Actually, the example doesn\'t show duplicates. Let me recall: the secret word was BRISK and guess was STORM -> S was marked with (-) even though there\'s only one S? Actually in STORM, the S is the first letter and in BRISK, S is the fourth? So no duplicate issue.\n\n Without knowing if duplicates are allowed, we should avoid duplicates for now? However, we have no information about duplicates. So let\'s try a word without duplicates.\n\n We need a word that has E and avoids S,L,A,T.\n\n Let me list common letters: E, R, I, C, N, D, O, etc.\n\n A good word might be ""CREPE"", but that has E at the end? We need to avoid E at the end. So not position 5.\n\n Another idea: ""CRONE""? But note: O is a vowel. But we don\'t know if O is present. However, we can try. But ""CRONE"" has E at the end? Position? C(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> E is at the end again. We should avoid that.\n\n We want E not at position 5.\n\n How about ""CREPT"": C,R,E,P,T -> but T was in the first guess and was absent! (T(x) in the first feedback) so we cannot use T.\n\n So we must avoid letters that are absent: S,L,A,T.\n\n Therefore, T is out.\n\n What about ""PRICE""? P,R,I,C,E -> E is at the end? Position 5. We want to avoid E at position 5.\n\n We can rearrange: but we need a word that has E at non-5th position.\n\n Try: ""PERCH"" -> but H? Let me check: PERCH is 5 letters? P,E,R,C,H -> yes. And E is at position 2? Also, it doesn\'t contain S,L,A,T.\n\n But note: we have E at position 2? That might be okay.\n\n But we can also try words with E at position 1? Like ""EERIE""? But duplicate E\'s? And also not common letters? Let me avoid duplicates.\n\n Alternatively: ""ROUGE""? O is unknown, U and G are common? But E at 5th again? No: R,O,U,G,E -> E at 5th? We don\'t want E at 5th.\n\n We must have E in one of the first four positions.\n\n How about ""URINE""? U,R,I,N,E -> E at the end? Position 5. Not good.\n\n How about ""ENDUE""? E at the start? But then we have D,U,E? And we don\'t know about D and U. Also, the word ENDUE: E(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5)? Two E\'s? And E at both 1 and 5? But we want to avoid position 5.\n\n Alternatively: ""OPINE""? O(1),P(2),I(3),N(4),E(5) -> again E at 5.\n\n I realize there are many words that end with E. We need to find one that doesn\'t.\n\n How about ""MEDIC""? M,E,D,I,C -> E at position 2. \n Also, M, D, I, C are not in the forbidden list? Yes, forbidden letters are S,L,A,T.\n\n So: M, E, D, I, C -> all allowed.\n\n Check if ""medic"" is a word? Yes.\n\n Another alternative: ""DRIVE""? D,R,I,V,E -> E at the end? Position 5. Not good.\n\n How about ""CRIED""? C,R,I,E,D -> E at position 4? That\'s acceptable. But C,R,I,E,D -> avoids S,L,A,T. And E is not at position 5.\n\n Another option: ""NICHE"" -> E at end? Bad.\n\n After considering, let me choose ""MEDIC"": because it has E at position 2 and avoids forbidden letters.\n\n But note: we are going to get feedback on the positions of M, D, I, C as well as E (but E we know is present but not in position 5, and we\'re putting it in position 2).\n\n We might get information about the position of E? If E is in the word and we put it in position 2, then if the secret word has E in position 2, it will be ✓, else if it\'s elsewhere it will be -. Or if the secret word has E in position 2, then we\'ll get ✓ for E? But if it doesn\'t, then we\'ll get - meaning E is elsewhere? Actually, the feedback for E could be:\n\n   - If the secret word has E in position 2, then we get ✓ for E? \n   - If the secret word has E in position 1,3, or4, then we get - for E? (since it\'s in the word but wrong position)\n\n So we can learn about E\'s position.\n\n Also, we will learn about M, D, I, C.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""MEDIC"".\n\n<guess>medic</guess>After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""slate"" (S✗, L✗, A✗, T✗, E-)—here\'s my analysis:\n\n1. **Key deductions**:\n   - E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since its feedback was ""-"", meaning misplaced).\n   - S, L, A, T are **not** in the secret word (all ✗).\n   - The secret word includes E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n2. **Strategy for next guess**:\n   - Must include E (avoided at position 5).\n   - Exclude S, L, A, T completely.\n   - Prioritize common unused consonants/vowels (like R, I, N, C, D, M) to maximize information.\n   - Test E in position 2 to efficiently probe its location.\n\nSelected **MEDIC** (M, E, D, I, C):\n- E in position 2 tests for correct placement.\n- D, I, M, C are new untested letters.\n- Avoids all forbidden letters and positions.\n\n<guess>medic</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two feedbacks:\nFrom Guess 1: slate -> S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nMeaning: E is present but not in the 5th position.

Since then we know E is not in 5. In the second guess, medic had E in position 2, which was also wrong position. So E is in the word but not in 2 or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, for I: we placed it in position 4 in medic and it was wrong position, but it is present. So I could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5? We don\'t know, so we have to consider.\n\nBut note: E must be in one of 1,3,4 and I must be in one of the positions but not 4 (since that\'s what we know from Guess 2).\n\nWe know the word has 5 letters: \nPosition 1: cannot be S,L,A,T,M,D,C (absent letters) and must be one of E, I or a new letter? But E in position 1 is possible.\n\nNow, we have to form a word with E and I. The absent letters are: S,L,A,T,M,D,C. So available letters: E, I, B,F,G,H,J,K,N,O,P,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe have limited tries left: 4 guesses remaining (since 2 used).\n\nWe should aim to use common letters and avoid absent ones.\n\nLet me try to think of words with E and I, avoiding S,L,A,T,M,D,C.\n\nSome options:\n- ""PIECE"": but has two E\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but let\'s avoid for now? Also, E appears twice? Additionally, C is absent? But we know C is absent so we cannot use C? In ""piece"", there is C? So no, because C is absent.\n- ""FIERY"": F,I,E,R,Y -> positions: F1, I2, E3, R4, Y5. This uses F and R and Y. Also, E is at position 3 (which is allowed) and I at position 2. We don\'t know about I at position 2? So we can test.\n- ""NEIGH"": N,E,I,G,H -> positions: N1, E2, I3, G4, H5. But E at position 2: we know E cannot be at position 2? Because in guess 2, we had E at 2 and it was wrong. So we cannot put E at 2 again.\n\nSo we must avoid putting E at position 2? Yes.\n\nIn ""FIERY"", E is at position 3? That\'s okay. And I at position 2? That\'s okay.\n\nAnother word: ""QUEEN""? But duplicates? And Q and U? And E at positions 3 and 4? Position 1: Q, position 2: U, position 3: E, position 4: E, position 5: N. But E at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is allowed? But we have two E\'s? And Q and U are available.\n\nBut we also have to consider that E cannot be in position 2 or 5? Here E is at 3 and 4? So okay? But let me check if Q and U are acceptable? Yes, because they are not in the absent list.\n\nBut ""QUEEN"" has duplicate E? And we don\'t know if there are duplicates? However, in the feedback system, duplicates might be treated separately? For example, if the secret word has two E\'s? Then guessing E in a position that has E would get ✓ or - accordingly. But in our case, we don\'t know? But we know there is at least one E.\n\nAlternatively, ""PINEY"": P,I,N,E,Y -> positions: P1, I2, N3, E4, Y5. This uses P, N, E, Y. And E at position 4? That is allowed (since not 2 or 5), and I at position 2? We don\'t know about I at 2? So we can try.\n\nBut note: in Guess 2, medic, we had I at position 4 and it was marked - meaning present but wrong position. So I cannot be at position 4? But we are putting I at position 2 now? Therefore, if the secret word has I at position 2, we get ✓ for I? If not, then we get - meaning I is somewhere else? Either way, we get information.\n\nSimilarly, for E, putting at position 4? We know E must be in 1,3, or4? So if we put E at 4, then if E is at 4 we get ✓; if E is at 1 or 3, we might get -? But wait: if E is at 1 in the secret word, will putting E at 4 still yield -? Yes, because the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.\n\nSo let\'s compare options:\n\nOption 1: FIERY (F,I,E,R,Y)\n  Positions: F1, I2, E3, R4, Y5\n  We test if E is at position 3? And I at position 2? And R is a new common letter.\n\nOption 2: PINEY (P,I,N,E,Y)\n  Positions: P1, I2, N3, E4, Y5\n  Tests: I at 2, E at 4.\n\nBoth seem reasonable. But note: we might also consider words with E at position 1? Because that is a possibility.\n\nFor example: ""EERIE""? Duplicates? Let\'s avoid duplicates.\n\n""ENNUI""? E1,N2,N3,U4,I5? But I at position 5? And duplicates N? Also, we have two N\'s? But we need to know if N is present? Also, E at 1: which is a possibility.\n\nBut we don\'t know about N? So we can test.\n\nHowever, ""ENNUI"" might not be common. Let me choose a more common word.\n\n""ELDER""? But D is absent? From Guess 2: D is absent? So we cannot use D? So ""elder"" is invalid.\n\nHow about ""EMBER""? E,M,B,E,R? But M is absent? So no.\n\n""OWRIE""? Not common.\n\nPerhaps ""EKRIS""? Not a word.\n\nLet me consider one with E at 1: ""ENDOW""? But D and O? D is absent? So no.\n\n""ENVOY"": E1,N2,V3,O4,Y5? This avoids absent letters? Absent: S,L,A,T,M,D,C? So D is absent? But in ""envoys"" we have V,O,Y? And E at 1? And N? \n""ENVOY"" is a word. But note: it does not contain the letter I? But we know the word has I? So we must include I? Otherwise, if we guess without I, then we might miss it? But we know I is present? So we must include I in the guess? Why? Because the word has I? So we cannot ignore it.\n\nYes, we know the secret word has I (because in Guess 2, medic, I got - meaning it is in the word). So we must include both E and I in our next guess? Otherwise we might not get enough information.\n\nTherefore, guesses must include E and I? Because they are present? And we need to locate them.\n\nSo words must include E and I? Yes.\n\nTherefore, FIERY and PINEY are both valid? And they include E and I.\n\nAdditionally, we need to test positions for E and I.\n\nIn PINEY: I at 2, E at 4. We know that I cannot be at position 4? Because it was in Guess 2 at 4 and marked as -. So putting I at 2 now: \n- If I is at 2, then ✓? \n- If not, then we get - meaning I is somewhere else? But we don\'t know where.\n\nSimilarly, E at 4: \n- If E is at 4, then ✓? \n- If E is at 1 or 3, then we get - because it\'s present but in wrong position? But if E is at 1, we put at 4: so -? Similarly for 3.\n\nAnother option: ""INNED""? But E at 5? But we know E cannot be at 5? And also D is absent? So no.\n\n""FINER"": F,I,N,E,R -> positions: F1,I2,N3,E4,R5? This has E at 4? Also, avoids absent letters? Yes: absent letters: S,L,A,T,M,D,C? So F,I,N,E,R are not in absent? But note E at 4? And I at 2? Same as PINEY? But R at 5.\n\nBut ""FINER"" is valid? Yes.\n\nCompared to FIERY: which has E at 3 and R at 4? And Y at 5.\n\nWe might also consider ""WIPER"": W,I,P,E,R -> positions: W1,I2,P3,E4,R5? But same as FINER? But with W and P? We don\'t know if W or P is common? Or R.\n\nPerhaps it\'s better to test new letters? For example, in FIERY we test F,R,Y? In PINEY we test P,N,Y? In FINER we test F,N,R? \n\nBut R was in FIERY? Let me make a decision.\n\nAlternatively: ""NEVER"" has two E\'s? And E at 1 and 4? Position: E1? Allowed. Then E4? Also allowed? But we don\'t know if duplicates? And V is available? But ""never"" has E twice? And we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Moreover, we have I? We must include I? So ""never"" doesn\'t include I? So no.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll choose between FIERY and PINEY.\n\nLet me pick FIERY because it tests E at position 3? In case E is at 3? And we haven\'t tested position 3 for E? Similarly, I at 2? And we haven\'t tested I at 2? Also, R at 4? And Y at 5? So it avoids positions we already know are wrong for E? But wait, we know E is not at 2 or 5? But at 3? We haven\'t tested.\n\nNote: In the first guess, we had slate which had no position 3 E? So we haven\'t tested position 3 for E? So that\'s new.\n\nSimilarly, PINEY tests E at 4? Also new? Because we haven\'t tested E at 4? Only at 2 and 5? So both are new positions? Position 3 (FIERY) and position 4 (PINEY).\n\nBut we also have to consider that for I: in PINEY we put I at 2? Which we haven\'t tested? And in FIERY also I at 2? Same for both? So that\'s same.\n\nTherefore, FIERY is F,I,E,R,Y? And PINEY is P,I,N,E,Y.\n\nBoth are fine. I\'ll go with FIERY because it uses R? Which is common? Or Y? \n\nActually, let me search for words without Y? Because Y is less common? Maybe? But we have to use available letters.\n\nBut I\'ll go with FIERY.\n\nSo next guess: FIERY\n\nBut note: FIERY is 5 letters? And valid? Yes.\n\nLet me confirm spelling? F-I-E-R-Y? Yes.\n\nSo:\n<guess>fiery</guess>### Analysis from Previous Feedback\n- **Guess 1: ""slate"" → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)**  \n  - E is in the secret word but not in position 5.  \n  - S, L, A, T are **absent**.  \n- **Guess 2: ""medic"" → M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)**  \n  - E is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was misplaced).  \n  - I is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was misplaced).  \n  - M, D, C are **absent**.  \n- **Aggregated insights**:  \n  - **Present letters**: E,  \n  - **Absent letters**: S, L, A, T, M, D, C (so guesses must avoid these).  \n- **Positional constraints for E**:  \n  - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (directly tested).  \n  - Must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.  \n- **Positional constraints for I**:  \n  - Cannot be in position 4 (tested), so must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.  \n- **Strategy for new guess**:  \n  - Must include **both E and I** (known present letters).  \n  - Avoid absent letters (S, L, A, T, M, D, C).  \n  - Test E in position 3 (untested valid position) and I in position 2 (untested valid position).  \n  - Prioritize high-frequency letters (e.g., R, N, F, Y) to maximize new information.  \n  - **Selected word: ""FIERY""**  \n    - F (position 1), I (position 2), E (position 3), R (position 4), Y (position 5).  \n    - Tests E in position 3 and I in position 2.  \n    - Uses new common letters (F, R, Y) not previously tested.\n\n<guess>fiery</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)\nGuess 3: fiery -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) E(-) R(-) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the third guess: ""fiery"" -> F(x) I(✓) E(-) R(-) Y(x)

Interpretation:
- I(✓) : The letter I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2). Since we placed I at position 2 and it's correct, the secret word has I at position 2.
- E(-) : The letter E is in the word but not in position 3 (where we placed it). So E is present but not at position 3.
- R(-) : The letter R is in the word but not in position 4 (where we placed it). So R is present but not at position 4.
- F(x) and Y(x): F and Y are not in the word.

Additionally, we know from previous guesses:
- From Guess 1: E is present (but not at position 5) and S,L,A,T absent.
- From Guess 2: E is present (but not at position 2), and M,D,C absent, and I present (but not at position 4; now we know it's at position 2).

So summary:
- Correct position: Position 2 is I.
- Present letters: E, R (and I, which is placed at position 2).
- Absent letters: S, L, A, T, M, D, C, F, Y.

Now, E must be in the word but not at position 2, 3, or 5. Since position 2 is occupied by I, and we know E can't be at 3 or 5, so E must be at position 1 or 4.

Similarly, R is present but not at position 4 (from this guess). So R can be at position 1, 3, or 5? But note: position 1 might be E? Or R? Also, position 4 is still available for R? Wait: we placed R at position 4 and it was marked ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at position 4. So R cannot be at 4? It can be at 1, 3, or 5? But position 1 might be taken by E or R? Position 3 is available? Position 5 is available.

The secret word structure:
Position 1: ? (must be one of E or R or another letter)
Position 2: I (fixed)
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: ?

But E must be at position 1 or 4? Because it can't be at 2,3,5. Similarly, R must be at position 1,3, or 5? But not at 4.

We need to form a word that has I in position 2, E at 1 or 4, R at 1,3, or 5? And avoid all absent letters: S,L,A,T,M,D,C,F,Y.

Available letters: besides E,R,I (which we know are in), we need two more? Or duplicates? We don't know? We haven't encountered duplicates so far? So we assume? But let's see.

Actually, we know the secret word has E, R, and I? And there might be two more letters? But we have 5 positions. Since we know three distinct letters? E, R, I? Then two more? Or duplicates? But we haven't found duplicates? So perhaps no duplicates? Or we don't know? But we'll try without duplicates first.

So available letters: E,R,I must be used, and we need two more letters from remaining unused: B,G,H,J,K,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z? 

Also, we know E must be at position 1 or 4? And R must be at position 1,3, or 5? But note: if E is at position 1, then R cannot be at position 1? And vice versa? So possible cases:

Case 1: E is at position 1
Then R must be at position 3 or 5? (since not at 4 and not at 1 because occupied by E? Or could R be at 1? No, because E is at 1? So R at 3 or 5.

Case 2: E is at position 4
Then position 1 is free? So R could be at 1? Or at 3 or 5? Also, position 4 is taken by E.

Now, we need a word that fits? And we have to choose one? Also, we have two other letters? How to choose?

We can list words that begin with E and have I at position 2? And use R? Or words that have E at position 4 and I at 2? And use R?

Additionally, we need to guess? Since we have limited tries? We want to test both possibilities? But we have one guess now? Fourth guess? Then after we get more information.

But maybe we can choose a word that covers common possibilities.

Let me think of words fitting the cases.

Case 1: E at position 1
Secret word: E, I at 2? Then what? 
Pattern: E I ? ? ? 
With R at position 3 or 5? And another letter? Plus R.

So, if R at position 3: E I R ? ?
Then we need two more letters? But we know R is only one? So the rest? Words like ""EIRIE""? But that's duplicate E? And E at 1 and 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5? So position 5 cannot be E. So that's out.

""EIRS""? Not 5 letters? We need 5 letters.

""EIRIE""? But E at 1 and at 5? But E at 5 forbidden? Because from first guess: E cannot be at 5? So no.

""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T? But we have G,H,T? T was absent from guess 1? Wait: T is absent? Yes, T(x) from slate? So we cannot use T? So not.

""EIBEN""? Not a word.

""EIDER"": but D is absent? D(x) from guess 2? So D absent.

""EIKED""? Not common? E at 1? And then? Also, E at 1? Position 1: E, 2: I, 3: K, 4: E, 5: D? But D absent? So invalid because D is absent.

Alternatively, R at position 5? Then: E I ? ? R

Words: ""EIDER"" again? D absent? Not.

""EIGER"": E,I,G,E,R? That has E at 1 and 4? Aha! But then the word would be E,I,G,E,R? Spelling? Yes: EIGER? But commonly spelled? Actually, ""Eiger"" is a proper noun? But we'll assume it's valid? Because the rules say ""valid 5-letter English word""?

Also, R at position 5? That works? But in the word ""eiger"": positions: E1, I2, G3, E4, R5? So E at 1 and 4? But we know E must be present? And here we have two E's? But we don't know if duplicates? However, we have E at position 1? And E at position 4? But we also know E cannot be at position 5? But not at 1? We don't know? It's allowed? And E at 4? Also allowed? Because we haven't tested E at 4? Only we have tested it? In this word, E at 4? We never put E at 4 before? So we don't know? 

But note: in the feedback for Guess 3: we put E at position 3 and got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at 3? So it's fine? But if the secret word has E at 4, that will be fine? But we also have E at position 1? So duplicate? The secret word might have two E's? 

But ""eiger"" might be acceptable? Let me find a better word.

Another common word: ""RIPER""? But R at 1? Then E at 4? But we are in case 1? We are considering E at 1? So not.

For case 1: E at 1, R at 5, and middle letters? Without forbidden ones.

Consider: ""EIVER""? Not a word.

""EIXED""? No.

Perhaps not common? Let's assume no duplicates? Then E at 1? Then the secret word has exactly one E? And it must be at 1? Then R would be the other letter? And what about position 3 and 4? They cannot be E? So we need two other letters? But we have R? Which must be at 3 or 5? And we need another letter.

Alternatively, let me look for case 2: E at position 4? Then the word: ? I ? E ? 

And R present? And can be at 1,3, or 5?

Also, avoid absent letters.

For example: words with pattern _ I ? E _

Common words: ""BIGGER"" too long? 5-letter: ""PIPED"" is 5? But D absent? Not? D is absent? So no D.

""MINED""? M,D absent? Not.

""WIPED""? D absent? Not.

""LIBER""? L absent? From guess 1? So no.

""RIVER"": R at position 1? I at 2? Position 3: V? Position 4: E? Position 5: R? But then R is duplicated? And it has E at position 4? That's good? Also R at position 1 and 5? But we haven't ruled out duplicates? But we have R present? And we got R(-) when we put R at 4? So if R were duplicated? Then putting R at 4 might show? Or not? Actually, our guess fiery had R at 4? And if secret word has R at 1 and 5? Then R at 4 should be marked absent? But the feedback said R(-)? Meaning R is in the word? So R is present? But it doesn't specify how many? So it could be duplicated? But in the feedback, we have R(-)? So the secret word has at least one R? And since we put R at 4 and it's not there? So R is elsewhere? Either at 1,3, or 5? Or duplicated? But if duplicated, we don't know positions? 

For ""RIVER"": 
- Position 1: R? If we put R at 1? And the secret word has R at 1? Then ✓? If it has R at 5? Then R at 1 would be marked - if R is also at 5? Or only if R is at 1 is wrong? Actually, the rules: the feedback symbol is per letter? And it's based on the occurrence? If a letter is duplicated, then each guess letter is compared? But typically in such games, if you have duplicates? But our feedback only says for that position? 

For example: secret word RIVER? Guess: FIERY? Then F vs R? F:x? Then I vs I? ✓? Then E vs V? E:x? Because E not in word? Wait: RIVER has no E? But we know E is present? So secret word cannot be ""river""? Because E is missing? 

We know E must be present? So ""river"" has R,I,V,E,R? So E at position 4? And R at 1 and 5? So it has E? So yes.

But E is at position 4? And we haven't tested E at 4? So if we guess ""river"", then:
Position 1: R? If R is at 1 or 5? But we placed R at 1? Then if secret word has R at 1? then ✓? Or if not? But since we got R(-) in Guess 3 at position 4? We know R is not at 4? But at 1? If we put at 1 in this guess? We might get ✓.

Similarly, position 4: E? And if secret word has E at 4? then ✓? If it has E at 1? but we are putting E at 4? But E cannot be at 1 because we are in case 2? We are assuming E at 4? So if E is at 4, we get ✓? But we don't know? 

But for ""RIVER"", if we guess we would get:

If secret word ""RIVER"": 
R at position 1: in secret, R is at position 1? So ✓? 
I at position 2: ✓? 
Position 3: we guess V? But secret word has V? At 3? So if R is at 1? And I at 2? V at 3? E at 4? R at 5? 

Then guess: RIVER? Then compare:
Position 1: R? Matches? ✓.
Position 2: I? Matches? ✓.
Position 3: V? Secret has V? And in correct position? So ✓.
Position 4: E? Matches E? ✓.
Position 5: R? Matches R? ✓.

But we haven't got any feedback? We are guessing. 

But problem: we know that from Guess 3, we got E(-) for position 3? And secret word ""river"" has no letter at position 3 that is E? So that's okay? Because we had E at 3? But it's not? So x? Or what? In this case, in Guess 3: we guessed ""fiery"" at position 3: E? And secret ""river"" has V at position 3? So E is not at position 3? But E is in the secret word (at position 4)? So the feedback for E should be ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Because there is an E? Though at different position? 

Yes: so for fiery:
- F: x (not in secret)
- I: ✓ (correct position)
- E: - (present but wrong position, because E is at position 4, not 3)
- R: - (present but wrong position? Secret has R at position 1 and 5? But we placed R at position 4? Which is E? So R is not? What letter at position 4 in secret? It is E? So R is at position 4? Secret has E? So R vs E? Not matching? And R is at position 4? Secret at position 4: E? So R should be marked? Since secret has R, but not at position 4? And not at position 4? So marked with ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Because even if R is duplicated? It can be counted? 

Actually, when there are duplicates, it gets complex? But typically? In Wordle? Each guessed letter matches only one position? And extras can be marked differently? But our rule says: ""-"" means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position? And it doesn't care about duplicates? 

In the secret word ""RIVER"": it has two R's? At position 1 and 5? 
In guess ""FIERY"": R is at position 4? 
The secret: position 1: R (matched to guessed R at position 4? Not positionally)? We have to assign? But typically? The algorithm might match exact positions first? Then for the leftover? It matches in the word? But in this case? For the R in guess? Position 4? Secret position 4 has E? So not matching? Then it looks: secret has two R's? At position 1 and 5? Both already not matched to exact? So one R can be matched to the guessed R? So since R is present? But at position 1 or 5? Not position 4? So marked with ""-""? 

And E at position 3? Secret has E at position 4? So E is present and marked with ""-""? 

So our feedback: F(x), I(✓), E(-), R(-), Y(x) would be consistent? 

Therefore, ""RIVER"" could be a candidate? 

But we must include the present letters: E and R and I? With I at position 2? And E at position 4? R? We don't know? But in ""RIVER"", R is at 1 and 5? And E at 4? Avoids forbidden letters? 

But now, we want to guess a word? That includes E and R? And I at 2? And we need to solve? 

Also, from Guess 3? We now know that I is fixed at position 2? So we might guess ""RIVER"" as the next word? But it might not be? 

Similarly, other words: ""NICER""? N,I,C,E,R? But C absent? So no? C is absent? 

""RIDER""? D absent? Not. 

""RISER""? S absent? Not. 

""RIVER""? As above? 

""WRECK""? W,R,E,C,K? C absent? Not. 

""ROUSE""? But S,O,U,E,R? S absent? And O? But we don't care? But S absent? Forbidden? So cannot?

""ROBED""? B,D,O,E,R? D absent? B? Available? But D absent? So invalid because D absent.

After trying, ""RIVER"" seems acceptable? And uses common letters? But does it have E at position 4? And I at 2? The pattern: position 4 is E? Yes? That's good? But we are not sure if E is at 4 or at 1? 

In Guess 3: we had R(-) at position 4? So in secret word? Position 4 is NOT R? Because R is present elsewhere? 

Similarly, E(-) at position 3? So position 3 is not E? 

So the secret word:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 3: cannot be E? And we know it can be R? Since R can be at position 3? 
- Position 4: cannot be R? And it could be E? 
- Position 1: could be E or R or other? 
- Position 5: could be R or other? 

Similarly, we know position 3 is not E? 4 is not R? 2 is I? 1 and 5? 

Now, with ""RIVER"": we assume position 4 is E? Position 1 is R? Position 3 is V? Position 5 is R? 

But we are not sure? We can also guess a word that has E at position 1 and R at position 5? For example? 

What word? ""E"" at 1, I at 2? Then? And E cannot be at 3 or 4? But position 4? Can be E? But we don't know? So if E at 1? Then the other positions: not E? So position 3,4,5? No E? But we know E is present? And we placed that at 1? So the only E is at position 1? Then we need R at position 3 or5? And position 4? 

For example: ""EIR"" something? But we don't have T? S? Etc? All those are absent? So: ""EIR"" ?

""EIBRY""? But Y absent? Y(x) from Guess 3? So no.

""EIGRE""? But R? And E at the end? E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? So wrong.

""EIGHT""? T absent? No.

No good word with E at 1? Without duplicates? 

Perhaps with duplicate? But I cannot use? 

Therefore, probably the secret word has E at position 4? So case 2 is more likely? 

Thus, words like ""RIVER""? 

Or ""INNER""? But not I at position 2? We must have I at position 2? We know position 2 is I? So ""RIVER"" has I at 2? So it's good.

Another word: ""PIGEON""? Too long? 6 letters? Not? 

""WIPER"": W,I,P,E,R? Position 1:W, 2:I, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R? This has E at 4? R at 5? And avoids absent letters? W,P are available? 

But also: ""hiver""? But H? Or ""giver""? G,I,V,E,R? G available?

But ""GIVER"": position 1:G, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R? 

Similarly, ""RIVER"" has R at 1? Which might be R? 

We can guess ""WIPER"" or ""GIVER"" or ""RIVER""? 

But note: we also have the letter R present? And in ""WIPER""? R at position 5? We had R marked - when at position 4? Now we put at position 5? If R is at position 5? Then we might get ✓? 

Similarly for E at position 4? If it is correct, we get ✓? 

Also, if we guess ""RIVER""? Then we risk? If it is not? But it has two R's? And we don't know? 

Perhaps we should avoid duplicates? So guess a word without duplicate and with E at 4? And R at position 5? Like ""WIPER"", ""GIVER"", etc? 

Let me choose ""WIPER"" because it uses W which is less common? Or ""GIVER""?

Actually, ""RIVER"" is more common? And we'll know? 

But to test? We choose ""RIVER""? 

But we also have option of ""BIGGER""? Too long? 

5-letter words: ""JIVER"" not common? 

Hence, I choose ""RIVER"" as the guess? 

But note: ""RIVER"" has two R's? And we have R marked? 

In our feedback? When we put R at position 4? We got -? Meaning R is present? But that doesn't prevent duplicates? 

So we go ahead? 

Therefore, next guess: RIVER

But let me see if there is a word without duplicate R? 

For example: ""QUIRE"" has Q? And U? But Q? Position: Q,U,I,R,E? But then R at position 4? And we know position 4 cannot be R? Because in Guess 3: R at 4 got ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not there? So if we put R at position 4 again? It would be wrong? But in secret? Position 4 is not R? R is at other position? So ""QUIRE"" has R at 4? Which is not allowed? Because we know R is not at position 4? 

Similarly, for any word, we should not put R at position 4? 

And ""RIVER"" has R at position 1 and 5? And position 4 is E? So not R? So it's fine? 

Similarly, ""GIVER"" has G at 1, I at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So no R at 4? And R at 5? 

Both ""GIVER"" and ""RIVER"" have E at 4? 

And ""WIPER"" same: W,I,P,E,R? Position 5: R? 

We can choose one? I will choose ""GIVER"" because we haven't tested G? Or ""RIVER"" uses R and V? 

Perhaps equally? I'll go with ""GIVER"".

So guessed word: GIVER

But let me think again: what if E is at position 1? and not at 4? Then secret word has E at 1? So ""GIVER"" would have G at 1 instead? And E at 4? Then if E is at 1? Then in ""GIVER"", position 1: G is compared to E? x? And E at position 4? Secret has E at 1? So E is marked -? But that's still possible? 

Whereas if we guess ""RIVER"", and if E is at position 1? Then position 1: R vs E? R? Not E? So x? And E at position 4: secret may have E at 1? So E at 4: x? Or if secret has E at 1? And no E elsewhere? Then E at 4 should be x? Because E is only at position 1? 

But we know E must be present? So in ""RIVER"": position 1: R? Secret? If E is at position 1? Then R at 1: not matching? And since secret has E at 1? Then at position 4: E in guess vs secret position 4: what? We don't know? But if secret has only one E at position 1? Then E in guess at position 4 is not? So marked x? Then R at position 5: secret has R? Or not? But we would get feedback? 

But if we guess ""RIVER"" and the secret has E at 1? Then we get E missing? But we already know E must be in the word? So it's a contradiction? 

Actually, no: the secret word could have other letters? But we guess and it may not have E? But we were told E is present? From earlier feedback? 

Yes, from Guess 1: E present? Guess 2: E present? Guess 3: E present? So E must be in the word? 

Therefore, if we guess ""RIVER"", and secret has E at position 1? Then at position 1: we would have R? Not E? So x? Then position 4: E? Secret at position 4: ? If not E? Then E should be marked x? If secret has E only at position 1? Then E at position 4: not E? So x? And since E is in secret? But at position 1? It should show in feedback? How?

The feedback for ""RIVER"" if secret has E at position 1, I at 2, etc: 
Position 1: guessed R vs actual E: not match? But E is in the secret? And at position 1? So for R? Since R is not at position 1? And secret has no R? Or R elsewhere? But if secret has R at position 5? Then R? 

For instance: suppose secret word: E I G H R? 
Then guess ""RIVER"": 
Pos1: R vs E: not match? And R is in secret? At position 5? So R at position 1- is marked ""-""? 
Pos2: I match? ✓.
Pos3: V vs G? x because V not in secret.
Pos4: E vs H? not match? But E is in the secret? At position 1? So E at position 4 should be marked ""-"" meaning present but wrong position.
Pos5: R vs R? match? ✓.

But we don't know secret? 

Similarly, if secret is E I ? ? ?, and we guess RIVER? 

But we don't know? 

But in our case? We can guess? 

But for efficiency? A word that uses more new letters? 

Also? We have only two unknowns? Essentially? Because E must be at 1 or 4? And R at 1,3,5? But position 1? Cannot have both? So if E at position 1? Then position 1 is E? And R can be at 3 or 5? 

If E at position 4? Then position 4 is E? And R at 1,3, or 5? 

Then the other positions? Position 3 must be a letter? And position 4 is fixed if E is there? 

So we need to test which case? 

For example, guess a word that has E at position 1? Then we'll know? 

But earlier? We couldn't find a valid word with E at position 1? Without forbidden letters? 

Perhaps ""ENRIK""? Not valid? 

Or ""ENROL""? But L? L absent? Or ""ENRAP""? Not valid? 

Alternatively, guess with E at position 4? And include common letters? 

Let me choose ""GIVER"" as the next guess? Because it has G and V? New letters? 

And it fits: position 1:G, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R? 

So guessed word: GIVER

We'll get feedback? If E at position 4 is correct? We get ✓? Else if E at position 4 is not? But if E is at position 1? then we get E at position 4 marked? As ""-"" because E is present but at 1? 

But also, position 1: if G is not in word? x? 

Similarly, position 5: R? Might be ✓ or - or x? 

So it will give us information? 

We hope to solve? Or get closer? 

So:

- **Guess 3 (fiery)**: F(x) I(✓) E(-) R(-) Y(x)  
  - I is **correct** and fixed in position 2.  
  - E is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - F, Y are **absent**.  
- **Aggregated insights**:  
  - **Present letters**: E, I, R  
  - **Absent letters**: S, L, A, T, M, D, C, F, Y  
  - **Positional constraints**:  
    - Position 2 is I (✓ confirmed).  
    - E cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → must be in position 1 or 4.  
    - R cannot be in position 4 → must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
  - The secret word must include E and R, with at least one of each.  

### Strategy for New Guess
- **Goal**: Narrow down positions for E and R using available letters.  
  - Option: Prioritize E in position 4 (untested) and R in position 5 (untested), while avoiding absent letters and invalid positions.  
- **Word selection**:  
  - Must start with a letter not absent (e.g., G, H, N, V) to test alternative patterns.  
  - Position 1: Untested letter (e.g., G) if E is not at position 1.  
  - Position 4: E (to test position 4) since E cannot be at positions 2, 3, or 5.  
  - Position 5: R (to test position 5) since R cannot be at position 4.  
- **Selected word: GIVER**  
  - Structure: G (pos1), I (pos2, ✓), V (pos3), E (pos4), R (pos5).  
  - Tests E in position 4 and R in position 5.  
  - Uses new common letters (G, V) to gather additional insights.  

<guess>giver</guess>",giver,"We have feedback from the third guess: ""fiery"" -> F(x) I(✓) E(-) R(-) Y(x)

Interpretation:
- I(✓) : The letter I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2). Since we placed I at position 2 and it's correct, the secret word has I at position 2.
- E(-) : The letter E is in the word but not in position 3 (where we placed it). So E is present but not at position 3.
- R(-) : The letter R is in the word but not in position 4 (where we placed it). So R is present but not at position 4.
- F(x) and Y(x): F and Y are not in the word.

Additionally, we know from previous guesses:
- From Guess 1: E is present (but not at position 5) and S,L,A,T absent.
- From Guess 2: E is present (but not at position 2), and M,D,C absent, and I present (but not at position 4; now we know it's at position 2).

So summary:
- Correct position: Position 2 is I.
- Present letters: E, R (and I, which is placed at position 2).
- Absent letters: S, L, A, T, M, D, C, F, Y.

Now, E must be in the word but not at position 2, 3, or 5. Since position 2 is occupied by I, and we know E can't be at 3 or 5, so E must be at position 1 or 4.

Similarly, R is present but not at position 4 (from this guess). So R can be at position 1, 3, or 5? But note: position 1 might be E? Or R? Also, position 4 is still available for R? Wait: we placed R at position 4 and it was marked ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at position 4. So R cannot be at 4? It can be at 1, 3, or 5? But position 1 might be taken by E or R? Position 3 is available? Position 5 is available.

The secret word structure:
Position 1: ? (must be one of E or R or another letter)
Position 2: I (fixed)
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: ?

But E must be at position 1 or 4? Because it can't be at 2,3,5. Similarly, R must be at position 1,3, or 5? But not at 4.

We need to form a word that has I in position 2, E at 1 or 4, R at 1,3, or 5? And avoid all absent letters: S,L,A,T,M,D,C,F,Y.

Available letters: besides E,R,I (which we know are in), we need two more? Or duplicates? We don't know? We haven't encountered duplicates so far? So we assume? But let's see.

Actually, we know the secret word has E, R, and I? And there might be two more letters? But we have 5 positions. Since we know three distinct letters? E, R, I? Then two more? Or duplicates? But we haven't found duplicates? So perhaps no duplicates? Or we don't know? But we'll try without duplicates first.

So available letters: E,R,I must be used, and we need two more letters from remaining unused: B,G,H,J,K,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z? 

Also, we know E must be at position 1 or 4? And R must be at position 1,3, or 5? But note: if E is at position 1, then R cannot be at position 1? And vice versa? So possible cases:

Case 1: E is at position 1
Then R must be at position 3 or 5? (since not at 4 and not at 1 because occupied by E? Or could R be at 1? No, because E is at 1? So R at 3 or 5.

Case 2: E is at position 4
Then position 1 is free? So R could be at 1? Or at 3 or 5? Also, position 4 is taken by E.

Now, we need a word that fits? And we have to choose one? Also, we have two other letters? How to choose?

We can list words that begin with E and have I at position 2? And use R? Or words that have E at position 4 and I at 2? And use R?

Additionally, we need to guess? Since we have limited tries? We want to test both possibilities? But we have one guess now? Fourth guess? Then after we get more information.

But maybe we can choose a word that covers common possibilities.

Let me think of words fitting the cases.

Case 1: E at position 1
Secret word: E, I at 2? Then what? 
Pattern: E I ? ? ? 
With R at position 3 or 5? And another letter? Plus R.

So, if R at position 3: E I R ? ?
Then we need two more letters? But we know R is only one? So the rest? Words like ""EIRIE""? But that's duplicate E? And E at 1 and 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5? So position 5 cannot be E. So that's out.

""EIRS""? Not 5 letters? We need 5 letters.

""EIRIE""? But E at 1 and at 5? But E at 5 forbidden? Because from first guess: E cannot be at 5? So no.

""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T? But we have G,H,T? T was absent from guess 1? Wait: T is absent? Yes, T(x) from slate? So we cannot use T? So not.

""EIBEN""? Not a word.

""EIDER"": but D is absent? D(x) from guess 2? So D absent.

""EIKED""? Not common? E at 1? And then? Also, E at 1? Position 1: E, 2: I, 3: K, 4: E, 5: D? But D absent? So invalid because D is absent.

Alternatively, R at position 5? Then: E I ? ? R

Words: ""EIDER"" again? D absent? Not.

""EIGER"": E,I,G,E,R? That has E at 1 and 4? Aha! But then the word would be E,I,G,E,R? Spelling? Yes: EIGER? But commonly spelled? Actually, ""Eiger"" is a proper noun? But we'll assume it's valid? Because the rules say ""valid 5-letter English word""?

Also, R at position 5? That works? But in the word ""eiger"": positions: E1, I2, G3, E4, R5? So E at 1 and 4? But we know E must be present? And here we have two E's? But we don't know if duplicates? However, we have E at position 1? And E at position 4? But we also know E cannot be at position 5? But not at 1? We don't know? It's allowed? And E at 4? Also allowed? Because we haven't tested E at 4? Only we have tested it? In this word, E at 4? We never put E at 4 before? So we don't know? 

But note: in the feedback for Guess 3: we put E at position 3 and got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at 3? So it's fine? But if the secret word has E at 4, that will be fine? But we also have E at position 1? So duplicate? The secret word might have two E's? 

But ""eiger"" might be acceptable? Let me find a better word.

Another common word: ""RIPER""? But R at 1? Then E at 4? But we are in case 1? We are considering E at 1? So not.

For case 1: E at 1, R at 5, and middle letters? Without forbidden ones.

Consider: ""EIVER""? Not a word.

""EIXED""? No.

Perhaps not common? Let's assume no duplicates? Then E at 1? Then the secret word has exactly one E? And it must be at 1? Then R would be the other letter? And what about position 3 and 4? They cannot be E? So we need two other letters? But we have R? Which must be at 3 or 5? And we need another letter.

Alternatively, let me look for case 2: E at position 4? Then the word: ? I ? E ? 

And R present? And can be at 1,3, or 5?

Also, avoid absent letters.

For example: words with pattern _ I ? E _

Common words: ""BIGGER"" too long? 5-letter: ""PIPED"" is 5? But D absent? Not? D is absent? So no D.

""MINED""? M,D absent? Not.

""WIPED""? D absent? Not.

""LIBER""? L absent? From guess 1? So no.

""RIVER"": R at position 1? I at 2? Position 3: V? Position 4: E? Position 5: R? But then R is duplicated? And it has E at position 4? That's good? Also R at position 1 and 5? But we haven't ruled out duplicates? But we have R present? And we got R(-) when we put R at 4? So if R were duplicated? Then putting R at 4 might show? Or not? Actually, our guess fiery had R at 4? And if secret word has R at 1 and 5? Then R at 4 should be marked absent? But the feedback said R(-)? Meaning R is in the word? So R is present? But it doesn't specify how many? So it could be duplicated? But in the feedback, we have R(-)? So the secret word has at least one R? And since we put R at 4 and it's not there? So R is elsewhere? Either at 1,3, or 5? Or duplicated? But if duplicated, we don't know positions? 

For ""RIVER"": 
- Position 1: R? If we put R at 1? And the secret word has R at 1? Then ✓? If it has R at 5? Then R at 1 would be marked - if R is also at 5? Or only if R is at 1 is wrong? Actually, the rules: the feedback symbol is per letter? And it's based on the occurrence? If a letter is duplicated, then each guess letter is compared? But typically in such games, if you have duplicates? But our feedback only says for that position? 

For example: secret word RIVER? Guess: FIERY? Then F vs R? F:x? Then I vs I? ✓? Then E vs V? E:x? Because E not in word? Wait: RIVER has no E? But we know E is present? So secret word cannot be ""river""? Because E is missing? 

We know E must be present? So ""river"" has R,I,V,E,R? So E at position 4? And R at 1 and 5? So it has E? So yes.

But E is at position 4? And we haven't tested E at 4? So if we guess ""river"", then:
Position 1: R? If R is at 1 or 5? But we placed R at 1? Then if secret word has R at 1? then ✓? Or if not? But since we got R(-) in Guess 3 at position 4? We know R is not at 4? But at 1? If we put at 1 in this guess? We might get ✓.

Similarly, position 4: E? And if secret word has E at 4? then ✓? If it has E at 1? but we are putting E at 4? But E cannot be at 1 because we are in case 2? We are assuming E at 4? So if E is at 4, we get ✓? But we don't know? 

But for ""RIVER"", if we guess we would get:

If secret word ""RIVER"": 
R at position 1: in secret, R is at position 1? So ✓? 
I at position 2: ✓? 
Position 3: we guess V? But secret word has V? At 3? So if R is at 1? And I at 2? V at 3? E at 4? R at 5? 

Then guess: RIVER? Then compare:
Position 1: R? Matches? ✓.
Position 2: I? Matches? ✓.
Position 3: V? Secret has V? And in correct position? So ✓.
Position 4: E? Matches E? ✓.
Position 5: R? Matches R? ✓.

But we haven't got any feedback? We are guessing. 

But problem: we know that from Guess 3, we got E(-) for position 3? And secret word ""river"" has no letter at position 3 that is E? So that's okay? Because we had E at 3? But it's not? So x? Or what? In this case, in Guess 3: we guessed ""fiery"" at position 3: E? And secret ""river"" has V at position 3? So E is not at position 3? But E is in the secret word (at position 4)? So the feedback for E should be ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Because there is an E? Though at different position? 

Yes: so for fiery:
- F: x (not in secret)
- I: ✓ (correct position)
- E: - (present but wrong position, because E is at position 4, not 3)
- R: - (present but wrong position? Secret has R at position 1 and 5? But we placed R at position 4? Which is E? So R is not? What letter at position 4 in secret? It is E? So R is at position 4? Secret has E? So R vs E? Not matching? And R is at position 4? Secret at position 4: E? So R should be marked? Since secret has R, but not at position 4? And not at position 4? So marked with ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Because even if R is duplicated? It can be counted? 

Actually, when there are duplicates, it gets complex? But typically? In Wordle? Each guessed letter matches only one position? And extras can be marked differently? But our rule says: ""-"" means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position? And it doesn't care about duplicates? 

In the secret word ""RIVER"": it has two R's? At position 1 and 5? 
In guess ""FIERY"": R is at position 4? 
The secret: position 1: R (matched to guessed R at position 4? Not positionally)? We have to assign? But typically? The algorithm might match exact positions first? Then for the leftover? It matches in the word? But in this case? For the R in guess? Position 4? Secret position 4 has E? So not matching? Then it looks: secret has two R's? At position 1 and 5? Both already not matched to exact? So one R can be matched to the guessed R? So since R is present? But at position 1 or 5? Not position 4? So marked with ""-""? 

And E at position 3? Secret has E at position 4? So E is present and marked with ""-""? 

So our feedback: F(x), I(✓), E(-), R(-), Y(x) would be consistent? 

Therefore, ""RIVER"" could be a candidate? 

But we must include the present letters: E and R and I? With I at position 2? And E at position 4? R? We don't know? But in ""RIVER"", R is at 1 and 5? And E at 4? Avoids forbidden letters? 

But now, we want to guess a word? That includes E and R? And I at 2? And we need to solve? 

Also, from Guess 3? We now know that I is fixed at position 2? So we might guess ""RIVER"" as the next word? But it might not be? 

Similarly, other words: ""NICER""? N,I,C,E,R? But C absent? So no? C is absent? 

""RIDER""? D absent? Not. 

""RISER""? S absent? Not. 

""RIVER""? As above? 

""WRECK""? W,R,E,C,K? C absent? Not. 

""ROUSE""? But S,O,U,E,R? S absent? And O? But we don't care? But S absent? Forbidden? So cannot?

""ROBED""? B,D,O,E,R? D absent? B? Available? But D absent? So invalid because D absent.

After trying, ""RIVER"" seems acceptable? And uses common letters? But does it have E at position 4? And I at 2? The pattern: position 4 is E? Yes? That's good? But we are not sure if E is at 4 or at 1? 

In Guess 3: we had R(-) at position 4? So in secret word? Position 4 is NOT R? Because R is present elsewhere? 

Similarly, E(-) at position 3? So position 3 is not E? 

So the secret word:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 3: cannot be E? And we know it can be R? Since R can be at position 3? 
- Position 4: cannot be R? And it could be E? 
- Position 1: could be E or R or other? 
- Position 5: could be R or other? 

Similarly, we know position 3 is not E? 4 is not R? 2 is I? 1 and 5? 

Now, with ""RIVER"": we assume position 4 is E? Position 1 is R? Position 3 is V? Position 5 is R? 

But we are not sure? We can also guess a word that has E at position 1 and R at position 5? For example? 

What word? ""E"" at 1, I at 2? Then? And E cannot be at 3 or 4? But position 4? Can be E? But we don't know? So if E at 1? Then the other positions: not E? So position 3,4,5? No E? But we know E is present? And we placed that at 1? So the only E is at position 1? Then we need R at position 3 or5? And position 4? 

For example: ""EIR"" something? But we don't have T? S? Etc? All those are absent? So: ""EIR"" ?

""EIBRY""? But Y absent? Y(x) from Guess 3? So no.

""EIGRE""? But R? And E at the end? E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? So wrong.

""EIGHT""? T absent? No.

No good word with E at 1? Without duplicates? 

Perhaps with duplicate? But I cannot use? 

Therefore, probably the secret word has E at position 4? So case 2 is more likely? 

Thus, words like ""RIVER""? 

Or ""INNER""? But not I at position 2? We must have I at position 2? We know position 2 is I? So ""RIVER"" has I at 2? So it's good.

Another word: ""PIGEON""? Too long? 6 letters? Not? 

""WIPER"": W,I,P,E,R? Position 1:W, 2:I, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R? This has E at 4? R at 5? And avoids absent letters? W,P are available? 

But also: ""hiver""? But H? Or ""giver""? G,I,V,E,R? G available?

But ""GIVER"": position 1:G, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R? 

Similarly, ""RIVER"" has R at 1? Which might be R? 

We can guess ""WIPER"" or ""GIVER"" or ""RIVER""? 

But note: we also have the letter R present? And in ""WIPER""? R at position 5? We had R marked - when at position 4? Now we put at position 5? If R is at position 5? Then we might get ✓? 

Similarly for E at position 4? If it is correct, we get ✓? 

Also, if we guess ""RIVER""? Then we risk? If it is not? But it has two R's? And we don't know? 

Perhaps we should avoid duplicates? So guess a word without duplicate and with E at 4? And R at position 5? Like ""WIPER"", ""GIVER"", etc? 

Let me choose ""WIPER"" because it uses W which is less common? Or ""GIVER""?

Actually, ""RIVER"" is more common? And we'll know? 

But to test? We choose ""RIVER""? 

But we also have option of ""BIGGER""? Too long? 

5-letter words: ""JIVER"" not common? 

Hence, I choose ""RIVER"" as the guess? 

But note: ""RIVER"" has two R's? And we have R marked? 

In our feedback? When we put R at position 4? We got -? Meaning R is present? But that doesn't prevent duplicates? 

So we go ahead? 

Therefore, next guess: RIVER

But let me see if there is a word without duplicate R? 

For example: ""QUIRE"" has Q? And U? But Q? Position: Q,U,I,R,E? But then R at position 4? And we know position 4 cannot be R? Because in Guess 3: R at 4 got ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not there? So if we put R at position 4 again? It would be wrong? But in secret? Position 4 is not R? R is at other position? So ""QUIRE"" has R at 4? Which is not allowed? Because we know R is not at position 4? 

Similarly, for any word, we should not put R at position 4? 

And ""RIVER"" has R at position 1 and 5? And position 4 is E? So not R? So it's fine? 

Similarly, ""GIVER"" has G at 1, I at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So no R at 4? And R at 5? 

Both ""GIVER"" and ""RIVER"" have E at 4? 

And ""WIPER"" same: W,I,P,E,R? Position 5: R? 

We can choose one? I will choose ""GIVER"" because we haven't tested G? Or ""RIVER"" uses R and V? 

Perhaps equally? I'll go with ""GIVER"".

So guessed word: GIVER

But let me think again: what if E is at position 1? and not at 4? Then secret word has E at 1? So ""GIVER"" would have G at 1 instead? And E at 4? Then if E is at 1? Then in ""GIVER"", position 1: G is compared to E? x? And E at position 4? Secret has E at 1? So E is marked -? But that's still possible? 

Whereas if we guess ""RIVER"", and if E is at position 1? Then position 1: R vs E? R? Not E? So x? And E at position 4: secret may have E at 1? So E at 4: x? Or if secret has E at 1? And no E elsewhere? Then E at 4 should be x? Because E is only at position 1? 

But we know E must be present? So in ""RIVER"": position 1: R? Secret? If E is at position 1? Then R at 1: not matching? And since secret has E at 1? Then at position 4: E in guess vs secret position 4: what? We don't know? But if secret has only one E at position 1? Then E in guess at position 4 is not? So marked x? Then R at position 5: secret has R? Or not? But we would get feedback? 

But if we guess ""RIVER"" and the secret has E at 1? Then we get E missing? But we already know E must be in the word? So it's a contradiction? 

Actually, no: the secret word could have other letters? But we guess and it may not have E? But we were told E is present? From earlier feedback? 

Yes, from Guess 1: E present? Guess 2: E present? Guess 3: E present? So E must be in the word? 

Therefore, if we guess ""RIVER"", and secret has E at position 1? Then at position 1: we would have R? Not E? So x? Then position 4: E? Secret at position 4: ? If not E? Then E should be marked x? If secret has E only at position 1? Then E at position 4: not E? So x? And since E is in secret? But at position 1? It should show in feedback? How?

The feedback for ""RIVER"" if secret has E at position 1, I at 2, etc: 
Position 1: guessed R vs actual E: not match? But E is in the secret? And at position 1? So for R? Since R is not at position 1? And secret has no R? Or R elsewhere? But if secret has R at position 5? Then R? 

For instance: suppose secret word: E I G H R? 
Then guess ""RIVER"": 
Pos1: R vs E: not match? And R is in secret? At position 5? So R at position 1- is marked ""-""? 
Pos2: I match? ✓.
Pos3: V vs G? x because V not in secret.
Pos4: E vs H? not match? But E is in the secret? At position 1? So E at position 4 should be marked ""-"" meaning present but wrong position.
Pos5: R vs R? match? ✓.

But we don't know secret? 

Similarly, if secret is E I ? ? ?, and we guess RIVER? 

But we don't know? 

But in our case? We can guess? 

But for efficiency? A word that uses more new letters? 

Also? We have only two unknowns? Essentially? Because E must be at 1 or 4? And R at 1,3,5? But position 1? Cannot have both? So if E at position 1? Then position 1 is E? And R can be at 3 or 5? 

If E at position 4? Then position 4 is E? And R at 1,3, or 5? 

Then the other positions? Position 3 must be a letter? And position 4 is fixed if E is there? 

So we need to test which case? 

For example, guess a word that has E at position 1? Then we'll know? 

But earlier? We couldn't find a valid word with E at position 1? Without forbidden letters? 

Perhaps ""ENRIK""? Not valid? 

Or ""ENROL""? But L? L absent? Or ""ENRAP""? Not valid? 

Alternatively, guess with E at position 4? And include common letters? 

Let me choose ""GIVER"" as the next guess? Because it has G and V? New letters? 

And it fits: position 1:G, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R? 

So guessed word: GIVER

We'll get feedback? If E at position 4 is correct? We get ✓? Else if E at position 4 is not? But if E is at position 1? then we get E at position 4 marked? As ""-"" because E is present but at 1? 

But also, position 1: if G is not in word? x? 

Similarly, position 5: R? Might be ✓ or - or x? 

So it will give us information? 

We hope to solve? Or get closer? 

So:

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,viper,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids duplicates to maximize information.
 Common starting words include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""SLATE"" as it has common letters: S, L, A, T, E.

 So, my first guess will be: SLATE

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""slate"" gave S(x), L(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)
 Interpretation:
 - E is in the word but not in the last position (since we guessed E in the 5th position and it's wrong position).
 - S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position. Also, it does not contain S, L, A, T.

 Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We need to make a new guess that:
   - Does not contain S, L, A, T (since they are absent)
   - Must include E, but not at the 5th position? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but in the wrong position (we put it at the 5th). So the word has E in position 1,2,3, or 4? But note: we don't know yet. However, we can avoid putting E in the 5th.

 Also, we know the word is 5 letters and E is one of them. We need to consider common letters.

 We know the missing letters: S, L, A, T. So we should avoid these.

 Let me think of common vowels and consonants. We have E already. Other common vowels: I, O, U (but U is less common). Consonants: R, N, C, etc.

 A good second guess might include E and try other common letters not in {S,L,A,T}.

 Also, note: the feedback tells us about the positions. Since we have E present but misplaced, we can put E in a different position.

 Consider the word ""CRANE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess), so we cannot use A. Similarly, ""SLATE"" had A and T which are out.

 Let me think of words without S,L,A,T that contain E and other common letters.

 Some options: 
   - ""RINCE"" ? Not a word.
   - ""PRICE"": P, R, I, C, E -> this has E at the end? But we cannot put E at the end? 
     Wait: the feedback doesn't say that E cannot be at the end? Actually, our first guess had E at the end and it was wrong position. That means in the secret word, E is not at the end (position 5). However, it might be in the middle. So we can put E in positions 1-4.

 But note: if we put E in position 5 again, that would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 5 for E.

 Therefore, for the next guess, we should put E in one of positions 1-4.

 Possible words: 
   - ""CREPE"" -> but we have two E's? And also, we have R and P. But note: we don't know about R, P, and C. Also, we have to avoid S,L,A,T.

 Alternatively, let's consider ""PIECE"" -> has two E's? Actually, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? But in the rules, duplicates are allowed? However, the feedback might not explicitly tell duplicates? We'll assume it tells per occurrence? Actually, the example doesn't show duplicates. Let me recall: the secret word was BRISK and guess was STORM -> S was marked with (-) even though there's only one S? Actually in STORM, the S is the first letter and in BRISK, S is the fourth? So no duplicate issue.

 Without knowing if duplicates are allowed, we should avoid duplicates for now? However, we have no information about duplicates. So let's try a word without duplicates.

 We need a word that has E and avoids S,L,A,T.

 Let me list common letters: E, R, I, C, N, D, O, etc.

 A good word might be ""CREPE"", but that has E at the end? We need to avoid E at the end. So not position 5.

 Another idea: ""CRONE""? But note: O is a vowel. But we don't know if O is present. However, we can try. But ""CRONE"" has E at the end? Position? C(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> E is at the end again. We should avoid that.

 We want E not at position 5.

 How about ""CREPT"": C,R,E,P,T -> but T was in the first guess and was absent! (T(x) in the first feedback) so we cannot use T.

 So we must avoid letters that are absent: S,L,A,T.

 Therefore, T is out.

 What about ""PRICE""? P,R,I,C,E -> E is at the end? Position 5. We want to avoid E at position 5.

 We can rearrange: but we need a word that has E at non-5th position.

 Try: ""PERCH"" -> but H? Let me check: PERCH is 5 letters? P,E,R,C,H -> yes. And E is at position 2? Also, it doesn't contain S,L,A,T.

 But note: we have E at position 2? That might be okay.

 But we can also try words with E at position 1? Like ""EERIE""? But duplicate E's? And also not common letters? Let me avoid duplicates.

 Alternatively: ""ROUGE""? O is unknown, U and G are common? But E at 5th again? No: R,O,U,G,E -> E at 5th? We don't want E at 5th.

 We must have E in one of the first four positions.

 How about ""URINE""? U,R,I,N,E -> E at the end? Position 5. Not good.

 How about ""ENDUE""? E at the start? But then we have D,U,E? And we don't know about D and U. Also, the word ENDUE: E(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5)? Two E's? And E at both 1 and 5? But we want to avoid position 5.

 Alternatively: ""OPINE""? O(1),P(2),I(3),N(4),E(5) -> again E at 5.

 I realize there are many words that end with E. We need to find one that doesn't.

 How about ""MEDIC""? M,E,D,I,C -> E at position 2. 
 Also, M, D, I, C are not in the forbidden list? Yes, forbidden letters are S,L,A,T.

 So: M, E, D, I, C -> all allowed.

 Check if ""medic"" is a word? Yes.

 Another alternative: ""DRIVE""? D,R,I,V,E -> E at the end? Position 5. Not good.

 How about ""CRIED""? C,R,I,E,D -> E at position 4? That's acceptable. But C,R,I,E,D -> avoids S,L,A,T. And E is not at position 5.

 Another option: ""NICHE"" -> E at end? Bad.

 After considering, let me choose ""MEDIC"": because it has E at position 2 and avoids forbidden letters.

 But note: we are going to get feedback on the positions of M, D, I, C as well as E (but E we know is present but not in position 5, and we're putting it in position 2).

 We might get information about the position of E? If E is in the word and we put it in position 2, then if the secret word has E in position 2, it will be ✓, else if it's elsewhere it will be -. Or if the secret word has E in position 2, then we'll get ✓ for E? But if it doesn't, then we'll get - meaning E is elsewhere? Actually, the feedback for E could be:

   - If the secret word has E in position 2, then we get ✓ for E? 
   - If the secret word has E in position 1,3, or4, then we get - for E? (since it's in the word but wrong position)

 So we can learn about E's position.

 Also, we will learn about M, D, I, C.

 Therefore, I choose ""MEDIC"".

<guess>medic</guess>After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""slate"" (S✗, L✗, A✗, T✗, E-)—here's my analysis:

1. **Key deductions**:
   - E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since its feedback was ""-"", meaning misplaced).
   - S, L, A, T are **not** in the secret word (all ✗).
   - The secret word includes E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

2. **Strategy for next guess**:
   - Must include E (avoided at position 5).
   - Exclude S, L, A, T completely.
   - Prioritize common unused consonants/vowels (like R, I, N, C, D, M) to maximize information.
   - Test E in position 2 to efficiently probe its location.

Selected **MEDIC** (M, E, D, I, C):
- E in position 2 tests for correct placement.
- D, I, M, C are new untested letters.
- Avoids all forbidden letters and positions.

<guess>medic</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two feedbacks:
From Guess 1: slate -> S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Meaning: E is present but not in the 5th position. S, L, A, T are absent.

From Guess 2: medic -> M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)
Meaning: 
- E is present but not in the 2nd position (since we got - for E in position 2). 
- I is present but not in the 4th position (since we put I at position 4 and got -). 
- M, D, C are absent.

So, overall:
- Absent letters: S, L, A, T, M, D, C
- Present letters: E, I (but E not in position 2 or 5, I not in position 4)

We need to find a word that uses E and I, and possibly other letters not in the absent list.

Also, note the positions:
For E: it must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it can't be in 2 or 5).
But wait, in the first guess, slate had E in position 5 and that was wrong position. Since then we know E is not in 5. In the second guess, medic had E in position 2, which was also wrong position. So E is in the word but not in 2 or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, for I: we placed it in position 4 in medic and it was wrong position, but it is present. So I could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5? We don't know, so we have to consider.

But note: E must be in one of 1,3,4 and I must be in one of the positions but not 4 (since that's what we know from Guess 2).

We know the word has 5 letters: 
Position 1: cannot be S,L,A,T,M,D,C (absent letters) and must be one of E, I or a new letter? But E in position 1 is possible.

Now, we have to form a word with E and I. The absent letters are: S,L,A,T,M,D,C. So available letters: E, I, B,F,G,H,J,K,N,O,P,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We have limited tries left: 4 guesses remaining (since 2 used).

We should aim to use common letters and avoid absent ones.

Let me try to think of words with E and I, avoiding S,L,A,T,M,D,C.

Some options:
- ""PIECE"": but has two E's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but let's avoid for now? Also, E appears twice? Additionally, C is absent? But we know C is absent so we cannot use C? In ""piece"", there is C? So no, because C is absent.
- ""FIERY"": F,I,E,R,Y -> positions: F1, I2, E3, R4, Y5. This uses F and R and Y. Also, E is at position 3 (which is allowed) and I at position 2. We don't know about I at position 2? So we can test.
- ""NEIGH"": N,E,I,G,H -> positions: N1, E2, I3, G4, H5. But E at position 2: we know E cannot be at position 2? Because in guess 2, we had E at 2 and it was wrong. So we cannot put E at 2 again.

So we must avoid putting E at position 2? Yes.

In ""FIERY"", E is at position 3? That's okay. And I at position 2? That's okay.

Another word: ""QUEEN""? But duplicates? And Q and U? And E at positions 3 and 4? Position 1: Q, position 2: U, position 3: E, position 4: E, position 5: N. But E at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is allowed? But we have two E's? And Q and U are available.

But we also have to consider that E cannot be in position 2 or 5? Here E is at 3 and 4? So okay? But let me check if Q and U are acceptable? Yes, because they are not in the absent list.

But ""QUEEN"" has duplicate E? And we don't know if there are duplicates? However, in the feedback system, duplicates might be treated separately? For example, if the secret word has two E's? Then guessing E in a position that has E would get ✓ or - accordingly. But in our case, we don't know? But we know there is at least one E.

Alternatively, ""PINEY"": P,I,N,E,Y -> positions: P1, I2, N3, E4, Y5. This uses P, N, E, Y. And E at position 4? That is allowed (since not 2 or 5), and I at position 2? We don't know about I at 2? So we can try.

But note: in Guess 2, medic, we had I at position 4 and it was marked - meaning present but wrong position. So I cannot be at position 4? But we are putting I at position 2 now? Therefore, if the secret word has I at position 2, we get ✓ for I? If not, then we get - meaning I is somewhere else? Either way, we get information.

Similarly, for E, putting at position 4? We know E must be in 1,3, or4? So if we put E at 4, then if E is at 4 we get ✓; if E is at 1 or 3, we might get -? But wait: if E is at 1 in the secret word, will putting E at 4 still yield -? Yes, because the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.

So let's compare options:

Option 1: FIERY (F,I,E,R,Y)
  Positions: F1, I2, E3, R4, Y5
  We test if E is at position 3? And I at position 2? And R is a new common letter.

Option 2: PINEY (P,I,N,E,Y)
  Positions: P1, I2, N3, E4, Y5
  Tests: I at 2, E at 4.

Both seem reasonable. But note: we might also consider words with E at position 1? Because that is a possibility.

For example: ""EERIE""? Duplicates? Let's avoid duplicates.

""ENNUI""? E1,N2,N3,U4,I5? But I at position 5? And duplicates N? Also, we have two N's? But we need to know if N is present? Also, E at 1: which is a possibility.

But we don't know about N? So we can test.

However, ""ENNUI"" might not be common. Let me choose a more common word.

""ELDER""? But D is absent? From Guess 2: D is absent? So we cannot use D? So ""elder"" is invalid.

How about ""EMBER""? E,M,B,E,R? But M is absent? So no.

""OWRIE""? Not common.

Perhaps ""EKRIS""? Not a word.

Let me consider one with E at 1: ""ENDOW""? But D and O? D is absent? So no.

""ENVOY"": E1,N2,V3,O4,Y5? This avoids absent letters? Absent: S,L,A,T,M,D,C? So D is absent? But in ""envoys"" we have V,O,Y? And E at 1? And N? 
""ENVOY"" is a word. But note: it does not contain the letter I? But we know the word has I? So we must include I? Otherwise, if we guess without I, then we might miss it? But we know I is present? So we must include I in the guess? Why? Because the word has I? So we cannot ignore it.

Yes, we know the secret word has I (because in Guess 2, medic, I got - meaning it is in the word). So we must include both E and I in our next guess? Otherwise we might not get enough information.

Therefore, guesses must include E and I? Because they are present? And we need to locate them.

So words must include E and I? Yes.

Therefore, FIERY and PINEY are both valid? And they include E and I.

Additionally, we need to test positions for E and I.

In PINEY: I at 2, E at 4. We know that I cannot be at position 4? Because it was in Guess 2 at 4 and marked as -. So putting I at 2 now: 
- If I is at 2, then ✓? 
- If not, then we get - meaning I is somewhere else? But we don't know where.

Similarly, E at 4: 
- If E is at 4, then ✓? 
- If E is at 1 or 3, then we get - because it's present but in wrong position? But if E is at 1, we put at 4: so -? Similarly for 3.

Another option: ""INNED""? But E at 5? But we know E cannot be at 5? And also D is absent? So no.

""FINER"": F,I,N,E,R -> positions: F1,I2,N3,E4,R5? This has E at 4? Also, avoids absent letters? Yes: absent letters: S,L,A,T,M,D,C? So F,I,N,E,R are not in absent? But note E at 4? And I at 2? Same as PINEY? But R at 5.

But ""FINER"" is valid? Yes.

Compared to FIERY: which has E at 3 and R at 4? And Y at 5.

We might also consider ""WIPER"": W,I,P,E,R -> positions: W1,I2,P3,E4,R5? But same as FINER? But with W and P? We don't know if W or P is common? Or R.

Perhaps it's better to test new letters? For example, in FIERY we test F,R,Y? In PINEY we test P,N,Y? In FINER we test F,N,R? 

But R was in FIERY? Let me make a decision.

Alternatively: ""NEVER"" has two E's? And E at 1 and 4? Position: E1? Allowed. Then E4? Also allowed? But we don't know if duplicates? And V is available? But ""never"" has E twice? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Moreover, we have I? We must include I? So ""never"" doesn't include I? So no.

Therefore, I'll choose between FIERY and PINEY.

Let me pick FIERY because it tests E at position 3? In case E is at 3? And we haven't tested position 3 for E? Similarly, I at 2? And we haven't tested I at 2? Also, R at 4? And Y at 5? So it avoids positions we already know are wrong for E? But wait, we know E is not at 2 or 5? But at 3? We haven't tested.

Note: In the first guess, we had slate which had no position 3 E? So we haven't tested position 3 for E? So that's new.

Similarly, PINEY tests E at 4? Also new? Because we haven't tested E at 4? Only at 2 and 5? So both are new positions? Position 3 (FIERY) and position 4 (PINEY).

But we also have to consider that for I: in PINEY we put I at 2? Which we haven't tested? And in FIERY also I at 2? Same for both? So that's same.

Therefore, FIERY is F,I,E,R,Y? And PINEY is P,I,N,E,Y.

Both are fine. I'll go with FIERY because it uses R? Which is common? Or Y? 

Actually, let me search for words without Y? Because Y is less common? Maybe? But we have to use available letters.

But I'll go with FIERY.

So next guess: FIERY

But note: FIERY is 5 letters? And valid? Yes.

Let me confirm spelling? F-I-E-R-Y? Yes.

So:

<guess>fiery</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)
Guess 3: fiery -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) E(-) R(-) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the third guess: ""fiery"" -> F(x) I(✓) E(-) R(-) Y(x)

Interpretation:
- I(✓) : The letter I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2). Since we placed I at position 2 and it's correct, the secret word has I at position 2.
- E(-) : The letter E is in the word but not in position 3 (where we placed it). So E is present but not at position 3.
- R(-) : The letter R is in the word but not in position 4 (where we placed it). So R is present but not at position 4.
- F(x) and Y(x): F and Y are not in the word.

Additionally, we know from previous guesses:
- From Guess 1: E is present (but not at position 5) and S,L,A,T absent.
- From Guess 2: E is present (but not at position 2), and M,D,C absent, and I present (but not at position 4; now we know it's at position 2).

So summary:
- Correct position: Position 2 is I.
- Present letters: E, R (and I, which is placed at position 2).
- Absent letters: S, L, A, T, M, D, C, F, Y.

Now, E must be in the word but not at position 2, 3, or 5. Since position 2 is occupied by I, and we know E can't be at 3 or 5, so E must be at position 1 or 4.

Similarly, R is present but not at position 4 (from this guess). So R can be at position 1, 3, or 5? But note: position 1 might be E? Or R? Also, position 4 is still available for R? Wait: we placed R at position 4 and it was marked ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at position 4. So R cannot be at 4? It can be at 1, 3, or 5? But position 1 might be taken by E or R? Position 3 is available? Position 5 is available.

The secret word structure:
Position 1: ? (must be one of E or R or another letter)
Position 2: I (fixed)
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: ?

But E must be at position 1 or 4? Because it can't be at 2,3,5. Similarly, R must be at position 1,3, or 5? But not at 4.

We need to form a word that has I in position 2, E at 1 or 4, R at 1,3, or 5? And avoid all absent letters: S,L,A,T,M,D,C,F,Y.

Available letters: besides E,R,I (which we know are in), we need two more? Or duplicates? We don't know? We haven't encountered duplicates so far? So we assume? But let's see.

Actually, we know the secret word has E, R, and I? And there might be two more letters? But we have 5 positions. Since we know three distinct letters? E, R, I? Then two more? Or duplicates? But we haven't found duplicates? So perhaps no duplicates? Or we don't know? But we'll try without duplicates first.

So available letters: E,R,I must be used, and we need two more letters from remaining unused: B,G,H,J,K,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z? 

Also, we know E must be at position 1 or 4? And R must be at position 1,3, or 5? But note: if E is at position 1, then R cannot be at position 1? And vice versa? So possible cases:

Case 1: E is at position 1
Then R must be at position 3 or 5? (since not at 4 and not at 1 because occupied by E? Or could R be at 1? No, because E is at 1? So R at 3 or 5.

Case 2: E is at position 4
Then position 1 is free? So R could be at 1? Or at 3 or 5? Also, position 4 is taken by E.

Now, we need a word that fits? And we have to choose one? Also, we have two other letters? How to choose?

We can list words that begin with E and have I at position 2? And use R? Or words that have E at position 4 and I at 2? And use R?

Additionally, we need to guess? Since we have limited tries? We want to test both possibilities? But we have one guess now? Fourth guess? Then after we get more information.

But maybe we can choose a word that covers common possibilities.

Let me think of words fitting the cases.

Case 1: E at position 1
Secret word: E, I at 2? Then what? 
Pattern: E I ? ? ? 
With R at position 3 or 5? And another letter? Plus R.

So, if R at position 3: E I R ? ?
Then we need two more letters? But we know R is only one? So the rest? Words like ""EIRIE""? But that's duplicate E? And E at 1 and 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5? So position 5 cannot be E. So that's out.

""EIRS""? Not 5 letters? We need 5 letters.

""EIRIE""? But E at 1 and at 5? But E at 5 forbidden? Because from first guess: E cannot be at 5? So no.

""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T? But we have G,H,T? T was absent from guess 1? Wait: T is absent? Yes, T(x) from slate? So we cannot use T? So not.

""EIBEN""? Not a word.

""EIDER"": but D is absent? D(x) from guess 2? So D absent.

""EIKED""? Not common? E at 1? And then? Also, E at 1? Position 1: E, 2: I, 3: K, 4: E, 5: D? But D absent? So invalid because D is absent.

Alternatively, R at position 5? Then: E I ? ? R

Words: ""EIDER"" again? D absent? Not.

""EIGER"": E,I,G,E,R? That has E at 1 and 4? Aha! But then the word would be E,I,G,E,R? Spelling? Yes: EIGER? But commonly spelled? Actually, ""Eiger"" is a proper noun? But we'll assume it's valid? Because the rules say ""valid 5-letter English word""?

Also, R at position 5? That works? But in the word ""eiger"": positions: E1, I2, G3, E4, R5? So E at 1 and 4? But we know E must be present? And here we have two E's? But we don't know if duplicates? However, we have E at position 1? And E at position 4? But we also know E cannot be at position 5? But not at 1? We don't know? It's allowed? And E at 4? Also allowed? Because we haven't tested E at 4? Only we have tested it? In this word, E at 4? We never put E at 4 before? So we don't know? 

But note: in the feedback for Guess 3: we put E at position 3 and got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at 3? So it's fine? But if the secret word has E at 4, that will be fine? But we also have E at position 1? So duplicate? The secret word might have two E's? 

But ""eiger"" might be acceptable? Let me find a better word.

Another common word: ""RIPER""? But R at 1? Then E at 4? But we are in case 1? We are considering E at 1? So not.

For case 1: E at 1, R at 5, and middle letters? Without forbidden ones.

Consider: ""EIVER""? Not a word.

""EIXED""? No.

Perhaps not common? Let's assume no duplicates? Then E at 1? Then the secret word has exactly one E? And it must be at 1? Then R would be the other letter? And what about position 3 and 4? They cannot be E? So we need two other letters? But we have R? Which must be at 3 or 5? And we need another letter.

Alternatively, let me look for case 2: E at position 4? Then the word: ? I ? E ? 

And R present? And can be at 1,3, or 5?

Also, avoid absent letters.

For example: words with pattern _ I ? E _

Common words: ""BIGGER"" too long? 5-letter: ""PIPED"" is 5? But D absent? Not? D is absent? So no D.

""MINED""? M,D absent? Not.

""WIPED""? D absent? Not.

""LIBER""? L absent? From guess 1? So no.

""RIVER"": R at position 1? I at 2? Position 3: V? Position 4: E? Position 5: R? But then R is duplicated? And it has E at position 4? That's good? Also R at position 1 and 5? But we haven't ruled out duplicates? But we have R present? And we got R(-) when we put R at 4? So if R were duplicated? Then putting R at 4 might show? Or not? Actually, our guess fiery had R at 4? And if secret word has R at 1 and 5? Then R at 4 should be marked absent? But the feedback said R(-)? Meaning R is in the word? So R is present? But it doesn't specify how many? So it could be duplicated? But in the feedback, we have R(-)? So the secret word has at least one R? And since we put R at 4 and it's not there? So R is elsewhere? Either at 1,3, or 5? Or duplicated? But if duplicated, we don't know positions? 

For ""RIVER"": 
- Position 1: R? If we put R at 1? And the secret word has R at 1? Then ✓? If it has R at 5? Then R at 1 would be marked - if R is also at 5? Or only if R is at 1 is wrong? Actually, the rules: the feedback symbol is per letter? And it's based on the occurrence? If a letter is duplicated, then each guess letter is compared? But typically in such games, if you have duplicates? But our feedback only says for that position? 

For example: secret word RIVER? Guess: FIERY? Then F vs R? F:x? Then I vs I? ✓? Then E vs V? E:x? Because E not in word? Wait: RIVER has no E? But we know E is present? So secret word cannot be ""river""? Because E is missing? 

We know E must be present? So ""river"" has R,I,V,E,R? So E at position 4? And R at 1 and 5? So it has E? So yes.

But E is at position 4? And we haven't tested E at 4? So if we guess ""river"", then:
Position 1: R? If R is at 1 or 5? But we placed R at 1? Then if secret word has R at 1? then ✓? Or if not? But since we got R(-) in Guess 3 at position 4? We know R is not at 4? But at 1? If we put at 1 in this guess? We might get ✓.

Similarly, position 4: E? And if secret word has E at 4? then ✓? If it has E at 1? but we are putting E at 4? But E cannot be at 1 because we are in case 2? We are assuming E at 4? So if E is at 4, we get ✓? But we don't know? 

But for ""RIVER"", if we guess we would get:

If secret word ""RIVER"": 
R at position 1: in secret, R is at position 1? So ✓? 
I at position 2: ✓? 
Position 3: we guess V? But secret word has V? At 3? So if R is at 1? And I at 2? V at 3? E at 4? R at 5? 

Then guess: RIVER? Then compare:
Position 1: R? Matches? ✓.
Position 2: I? Matches? ✓.
Position 3: V? Secret has V? And in correct position? So ✓.
Position 4: E? Matches E? ✓.
Position 5: R? Matches R? ✓.

But we haven't got any feedback? We are guessing. 

But problem: we know that from Guess 3, we got E(-) for position 3? And secret word ""river"" has no letter at position 3 that is E? So that's okay? Because we had E at 3? But it's not? So x? Or what? In this case, in Guess 3: we guessed ""fiery"" at position 3: E? And secret ""river"" has V at position 3? So E is not at position 3? But E is in the secret word (at position 4)? So the feedback for E should be ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Because there is an E? Though at different position? 

Yes: so for fiery:
- F: x (not in secret)
- I: ✓ (correct position)
- E: - (present but wrong position, because E is at position 4, not 3)
- R: - (present but wrong position? Secret has R at position 1 and 5? But we placed R at position 4? Which is E? So R is not? What letter at position 4 in secret? It is E? So R is at position 4? Secret has E? So R vs E? Not matching? And R is at position 4? Secret at position 4: E? So R should be marked? Since secret has R, but not at position 4? And not at position 4? So marked with ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Because even if R is duplicated? It can be counted? 

Actually, when there are duplicates, it gets complex? But typically? In Wordle? Each guessed letter matches only one position? And extras can be marked differently? But our rule says: ""-"" means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position? And it doesn't care about duplicates? 

In the secret word ""RIVER"": it has two R's? At position 1 and 5? 
In guess ""FIERY"": R is at position 4? 
The secret: position 1: R (matched to guessed R at position 4? Not positionally)? We have to assign? But typically? The algorithm might match exact positions first? Then for the leftover? It matches in the word? But in this case? For the R in guess? Position 4? Secret position 4 has E? So not matching? Then it looks: secret has two R's? At position 1 and 5? Both already not matched to exact? So one R can be matched to the guessed R? So since R is present? But at position 1 or 5? Not position 4? So marked with ""-""? 

And E at position 3? Secret has E at position 4? So E is present and marked with ""-""? 

So our feedback: F(x), I(✓), E(-), R(-), Y(x) would be consistent? 

Therefore, ""RIVER"" could be a candidate? 

But we must include the present letters: E and R and I? With I at position 2? And E at position 4? R? We don't know? But in ""RIVER"", R is at 1 and 5? And E at 4? Avoids forbidden letters? 

But now, we want to guess a word? That includes E and R? And I at 2? And we need to solve? 

Also, from Guess 3? We now know that I is fixed at position 2? So we might guess ""RIVER"" as the next word? But it might not be? 

Similarly, other words: ""NICER""? N,I,C,E,R? But C absent? So no? C is absent? 

""RIDER""? D absent? Not. 

""RISER""? S absent? Not. 

""RIVER""? As above? 

""WRECK""? W,R,E,C,K? C absent? Not. 

""ROUSE""? But S,O,U,E,R? S absent? And O? But we don't care? But S absent? Forbidden? So cannot?

""ROBED""? B,D,O,E,R? D absent? B? Available? But D absent? So invalid because D absent.

After trying, ""RIVER"" seems acceptable? And uses common letters? But does it have E at position 4? And I at 2? The pattern: position 4 is E? Yes? That's good? But we are not sure if E is at 4 or at 1? 

In Guess 3: we had R(-) at position 4? So in secret word? Position 4 is NOT R? Because R is present elsewhere? 

Similarly, E(-) at position 3? So position 3 is not E? 

So the secret word:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 3: cannot be E? And we know it can be R? Since R can be at position 3? 
- Position 4: cannot be R? And it could be E? 
- Position 1: could be E or R or other? 
- Position 5: could be R or other? 

Similarly, we know position 3 is not E? 4 is not R? 2 is I? 1 and 5? 

Now, with ""RIVER"": we assume position 4 is E? Position 1 is R? Position 3 is V? Position 5 is R? 

But we are not sure? We can also guess a word that has E at position 1 and R at position 5? For example? 

What word? ""E"" at 1, I at 2? Then? And E cannot be at 3 or 4? But position 4? Can be E? But we don't know? So if E at 1? Then the other positions: not E? So position 3,4,5? No E? But we know E is present? And we placed that at 1? So the only E is at position 1? Then we need R at position 3 or5? And position 4? 

For example: ""EIR"" something? But we don't have T? S? Etc? All those are absent? So: ""EIR"" ?

""EIBRY""? But Y absent? Y(x) from Guess 3? So no.

""EIGRE""? But R? And E at the end? E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? So wrong.

""EIGHT""? T absent? No.

No good word with E at 1? Without duplicates? 

Perhaps with duplicate? But I cannot use? 

Therefore, probably the secret word has E at position 4? So case 2 is more likely? 

Thus, words like ""RIVER""? 

Or ""INNER""? But not I at position 2? We must have I at position 2? We know position 2 is I? So ""RIVER"" has I at 2? So it's good.

Another word: ""PIGEON""? Too long? 6 letters? Not? 

""WIPER"": W,I,P,E,R? Position 1:W, 2:I, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R? This has E at 4? R at 5? And avoids absent letters? W,P are available? 

But also: ""hiver""? But H? Or ""giver""? G,I,V,E,R? G available?

But ""GIVER"": position 1:G, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R? 

Similarly, ""RIVER"" has R at 1? Which might be R? 

We can guess ""WIPER"" or ""GIVER"" or ""RIVER""? 

But note: we also have the letter R present? And in ""WIPER""? R at position 5? We had R marked - when at position 4? Now we put at position 5? If R is at position 5? Then we might get ✓? 

Similarly for E at position 4? If it is correct, we get ✓? 

Also, if we guess ""RIVER""? Then we risk? If it is not? But it has two R's? And we don't know? 

Perhaps we should avoid duplicates? So guess a word without duplicate and with E at 4? And R at position 5? Like ""WIPER"", ""GIVER"", etc? 

Let me choose ""WIPER"" because it uses W which is less common? Or ""GIVER""?

Actually, ""RIVER"" is more common? And we'll know? 

But to test? We choose ""RIVER""? 

But we also have option of ""BIGGER""? Too long? 

5-letter words: ""JIVER"" not common? 

Hence, I choose ""RIVER"" as the guess? 

But note: ""RIVER"" has two R's? And we have R marked? 

In our feedback? When we put R at position 4? We got -? Meaning R is present? But that doesn't prevent duplicates? 

So we go ahead? 

Therefore, next guess: RIVER

But let me see if there is a word without duplicate R? 

For example: ""QUIRE"" has Q? And U? But Q? Position: Q,U,I,R,E? But then R at position 4? And we know position 4 cannot be R? Because in Guess 3: R at 4 got ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not there? So if we put R at position 4 again? It would be wrong? But in secret? Position 4 is not R? R is at other position? So ""QUIRE"" has R at 4? Which is not allowed? Because we know R is not at position 4? 

Similarly, for any word, we should not put R at position 4? 

And ""RIVER"" has R at position 1 and 5? And position 4 is E? So not R? So it's fine? 

Similarly, ""GIVER"" has G at 1, I at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So no R at 4? And R at 5? 

Both ""GIVER"" and ""RIVER"" have E at 4? 

And ""WIPER"" same: W,I,P,E,R? Position 5: R? 

We can choose one? I will choose ""GIVER"" because we haven't tested G? Or ""RIVER"" uses R and V? 

Perhaps equally? I'll go with ""GIVER"".

So guessed word: GIVER

But let me think again: what if E is at position 1? and not at 4? Then secret word has E at 1? So ""GIVER"" would have G at 1 instead? And E at 4? Then if E is at 1? Then in ""GIVER"", position 1: G is compared to E? x? And E at position 4? Secret has E at 1? So E is marked -? But that's still possible? 

Whereas if we guess ""RIVER"", and if E is at position 1? Then position 1: R vs E? R? Not E? So x? And E at position 4: secret may have E at 1? So E at 4: x? Or if secret has E at 1? And no E elsewhere? Then E at 4 should be x? Because E is only at position 1? 

But we know E must be present? So in ""RIVER"": position 1: R? Secret? If E is at position 1? Then R at 1: not matching? And since secret has E at 1? Then at position 4: E in guess vs secret position 4: what? We don't know? But if secret has only one E at position 1? Then E in guess at position 4 is not? So marked x? Then R at position 5: secret has R? Or not? But we would get feedback? 

But if we guess ""RIVER"" and the secret has E at 1? Then we get E missing? But we already know E must be in the word? So it's a contradiction? 

Actually, no: the secret word could have other letters? But we guess and it may not have E? But we were told E is present? From earlier feedback? 

Yes, from Guess 1: E present? Guess 2: E present? Guess 3: E present? So E must be in the word? 

Therefore, if we guess ""RIVER"", and secret has E at position 1? Then at position 1: we would have R? Not E? So x? Then position 4: E? Secret at position 4: ? If not E? Then E should be marked x? If secret has E only at position 1? Then E at position 4: not E? So x? And since E is in secret? But at position 1? It should show in feedback? How?

The feedback for ""RIVER"" if secret has E at position 1, I at 2, etc: 
Position 1: guessed R vs actual E: not match? But E is in the secret? And at position 1? So for R? Since R is not at position 1? And secret has no R? Or R elsewhere? But if secret has R at position 5? Then R? 

For instance: suppose secret word: E I G H R? 
Then guess ""RIVER"": 
Pos1: R vs E: not match? And R is in secret? At position 5? So R at position 1- is marked ""-""? 
Pos2: I match? ✓.
Pos3: V vs G? x because V not in secret.
Pos4: E vs H? not match? But E is in the secret? At position 1? So E at position 4 should be marked ""-"" meaning present but wrong position.
Pos5: R vs R? match? ✓.

But we don't know secret? 

Similarly, if secret is E I ? ? ?, and we guess RIVER? 

But we don't know? 

But in our case? We can guess? 

But for efficiency? A word that uses more new letters? 

Also? We have only two unknowns? Essentially? Because E must be at 1 or 4? And R at 1,3,5? But position 1? Cannot have both? So if E at position 1? Then position 1 is E? And R can be at 3 or 5? 

If E at position 4? Then position 4 is E? And R at 1,3, or 5? 

Then the other positions? Position 3 must be a letter? And position 4 is fixed if E is there? 

So we need to test which case? 

For example, guess a word that has E at position 1? Then we'll know? 

But earlier? We couldn't find a valid word with E at position 1? Without forbidden letters? 

Perhaps ""ENRIK""? Not valid? 

Or ""ENROL""? But L? L absent? Or ""ENRAP""? Not valid? 

Alternatively, guess with E at position 4? And include common letters? 

Let me choose ""GIVER"" as the next guess? Because it has G and V? New letters? 

And it fits: position 1:G, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R? 

So guessed word: GIVER

We'll get feedback? If E at position 4 is correct? We get ✓? Else if E at position 4 is not? But if E is at position 1? then we get E at position 4 marked? As ""-"" because E is present but at 1? 

But also, position 1: if G is not in word? x? 

Similarly, position 5: R? Might be ✓ or - or x? 

So it will give us information? 

We hope to solve? Or get closer? 

So:

<guess>giver</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1 (slate)**: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)  
  - E is in the secret word but not in position 5.  
  - S, L, A, T are **absent**.  
- **Guess 2 (medic)**: M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)  
  - E is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - I is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - M, D, C are **absent**.  
- **Guess 3 (fiery)**: F(x) I(✓) E(-) R(-) Y(x)

  - E is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - F, Y are **absent**.  
- **Aggregated insights**:  
  - **Present letters**: E, I, R  
  - **Absent letters**: S, L, A, T, M, D, C, F, Y  
  - **Positional constraints**:  
    - Position 2 is I (✓ confirmed).  
    - E cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → must be in position 1 or 4.  
    - R cannot be in position 4 → must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
  - The secret word must include E and R, with at least one of each.  

### Strategy for New Guess
- **Goal**: Narrow down positions for E and R using available letters.  
  - Option: Prioritize E in position 4 (untested) and R in position 5 (untested), while avoiding absent letters and invalid positions.  
- **Word selection**:  
  - Must start with a letter not absent (e.g., G, H, N, V) to test alternative patterns.  
  - Position 1: Untested letter (e.g., G) if E is not at position 1.  
  - Position 4: E (to test position 4) since E cannot be at positions 2, 3, or 5.  
  - Position 5: R (to test position 5) since R cannot be at position 4.  
- **Selected word: GIVER**  
  - Structure: G (pos1), I (pos2, ✓), V (pos3), E (pos4), R (pos5).  
  - Tests E in position 4 and R in position 5.  
  - Uses new common letters (G, V) to gather additional insights.

Also, it does not contain S, L, A, T.\n\n Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions.\n\n We need to make a new guess that:\n   - Does not contain S, L, A, T (since they are absent)\n   - Must include E, but not at the 5th position? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but in the wrong position (we put it at the 5th). So the word has E in position 1,2,3, or 4? But note: we don\'t know yet. However, we can avoid putting E in the 5th.\n\n Also, we know the word is 5 letters and E is one of them. We need to consider common letters.\n\n We know the missing letters: S, L, A, T. So we should avoid these.\n\n Let me think of common vowels and consonants. We have E already. Other common vowels: I, O, U (but U is less common). Consonants: R, N, C, etc.\n\n A good second guess might include E and try other common letters not in {S,L,A,T}.\n\n Also, note: the feedback tells us about the positions. Since we have E present but misplaced, we can put E in a different position.\n\n Consider the word ""CRANE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess), so we cannot use A.

Not a word.\n   - ""PRICE"": P, R, I, C, E -> this has E at the end? But we cannot put E at the end? \n     Wait: the feedback doesn\'t say that E cannot be at the end? Actually, our first guess had E at the end and it was wrong position. That means in the secret word, E is not at the end (position 5). However, it might be in the middle. So we can put E in positions 1-4.\n\n But note: if we put E in position 5 again, that would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid position 5 for E.\n\n Therefore, for the next guess, we should put E in one of positions 1-4.\n\n Possible words: \n   - ""CREPE"" -> but we have two E\'s? And also, we have R and P. But note: we don\'t know about R, P, and C. Also, we have to avoid S,L,A,T.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s consider ""PIECE"" -> has two E\'s? Actually, we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters? But in the rules, duplicates are allowed? However, the feedback might not explicitly tell duplicates? We\'ll assume it tells per occurrence? Actually, the example doesn\'t show duplicates. Let me recall: the secret word was BRISK and guess was STORM -> S was marked with (-) even though there\'s only one S? Actually in STORM, the S is the first letter and in BRISK, S is the fourth? So no duplicate issue.\n\n Without knowing if duplicates are allowed, we should avoid duplicates for now? However, we have no information about duplicates. So let\'s try a word without duplicates.\n\n We need a word that has E and avoids S,L,A,T.\n\n Let me list common letters: E, R, I, C, N, D, O, etc.\n\n A good word might be ""CREPE"", but that has E at the end? We need to avoid E at the end. So not position 5.\n\n Another idea: ""CRONE""? But note: O is a vowel. But we don\'t know if O is present. However, we can try. But ""CRONE"" has E at the end? Position? C(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> E is at the end again. We should avoid that.\n\n We want E not at position 5.\n\n How about ""CREPT"": C,R,E,P,T -> but T was in the first guess and was absent! (T(x) in the first feedback) so we cannot use T.\n\n So we must avoid letters that are absent: S,L,A,T.\n\n Therefore, T is out.\n\n What about ""PRICE""? P,R,I,C,E -> E is at the end? Position 5. We want to avoid E at position 5.\n\n We can rearrange: but we need a word that has E at non-5th position.\n\n Try: ""PERCH"" -> but H? Let me check: PERCH is 5 letters? P,E,R,C,H -> yes. And E is at position 2? Also, it doesn\'t contain S,L,A,T.\n\n But note: we have E at position 2? That might be okay.\n\n But we can also try words with E at position 1? Like ""EERIE""? But duplicate E\'s? And also not common letters? Let me avoid duplicates.\n\n Alternatively: ""ROUGE""? O is unknown, U and G are common? But E at 5th again? No: R,O,U,G,E -> E at 5th? We don\'t want E at 5th.\n\n We must have E in one of the first four positions.\n\n How about ""URINE""? U,R,I,N,E -> E at the end? Position 5. Not good.\n\n How about ""ENDUE""? E at the start? But then we have D,U,E? And we don\'t know about D and U. Also, the word ENDUE: E(1), N(2), D(3), U(4), E(5)? Two E\'s? And E at both 1 and 5? But we want to avoid position 5.\n\n Alternatively: ""OPINE""? O(1),P(2),I(3),N(4),E(5) -> again E at 5.\n\n I realize there are many words that end with E. We need to find one that doesn\'t.\n\n How about ""MEDIC""? M,E,D,I,C -> E at position 2. \n Also, M, D, I, C are not in the forbidden list? Yes, forbidden letters are S,L,A,T.\n\n So: M, E, D, I, C -> all allowed.\n\n Check if ""medic"" is a word? Yes.\n\n Another alternative: ""DRIVE""? D,R,I,V,E -> E at the end? Position 5. Not good.\n\n How about ""CRIED""? C,R,I,E,D -> E at position 4? That\'s acceptable. But C,R,I,E,D -> avoids S,L,A,T. And E is not at position 5.\n\n Another option: ""NICHE"" -> E at end? Bad.\n\n After considering, let me choose ""MEDIC"": because it has E at position 2 and avoids forbidden letters.\n\n But note: we are going to get feedback on the positions of M, D, I, C as well as E (but E we know is present but not in position 5, and we\'re putting it in position 2).\n\n We might get information about the position of E? If E is in the word and we put it in position 2, then if the secret word has E in position 2, it will be ✓, else if it\'s elsewhere it will be -. Or if the secret word has E in position 2, then we\'ll get ✓ for E? But if it doesn\'t, then we\'ll get - meaning E is elsewhere? Actually, the feedback for E could be:\n\n   - If the secret word has E in position 2, then we get ✓ for E? \n   - If the secret word has E in position 1,3, or4, then we get - for E? (since it\'s in the word but wrong position)\n\n So we can learn about E\'s position.\n\n Also, we will learn about M, D, I, C.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""MEDIC"".\n\n<guess>medic</guess>After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""slate"" (S✗, L✗, A✗, T✗, E-)—here\'s my analysis:\n\n1. **Key deductions**:\n   - E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since its feedback was ""-"", meaning misplaced).\n   - S, L, A, T are **not** in the secret word (all ✗).\n   - The secret word includes E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n2. **Strategy for next guess**:\n   - Must include E (avoided at position 5).\n   - Exclude S, L, A, T completely.\n   - Prioritize common unused consonants/vowels (like R, I, N, C, D, M) to maximize information.\n   - Test E in position 2 to efficiently probe its location.\n\nSelected **MEDIC** (M, E, D, I, C):\n- E in position 2 tests for correct placement.\n- D, I, M, C are new untested letters.\n- Avoids all forbidden letters and positions.\n\n<guess>medic</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two feedbacks:\nFrom Guess 1: slate -> S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nMeaning: E is present but not in the 5th position. S, L, A, T are absent.\n\nFrom Guess 2: medic -> M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)\nMeaning: \n- E is present but not in the 2nd position (since we got - for E in position 2). \n- I is present but not in the 4th position (since we put I at position 4 and got -). \n- M, D, C are absent.\n\nSo, overall:\n- Absent letters: S, L, A, T, M, D, C\n- Present letters: E, I (but E not in position 2 or 5, I not in position 4)\n\nWe need to find a word that uses E and I, and possibly other letters not in the absent list.\n\nAlso, note the positions:\nFor E: it must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it can\'t be in 2 or 5).\nBut wait, in the first guess, slate had E in position 5 and that was wrong position. Since then we know E is not in 5. In the second guess, medic had E in position 2, which was also wrong position. So E is in the word but not in 2 or 5. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, for I: we placed it in position 4 in medic and it was wrong position, but it is present. So I could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5? We don\'t know, so we have to consider.\n\nBut note: E must be in one of 1,3,4 and I must be in one of the positions but not 4 (since that\'s what we know from Guess 2).\n\nWe know the word has 5 letters: \nPosition 1: cannot be S,L,A,T,M,D,C (absent letters) and must be one of E, I or a new letter? But E in position 1 is possible.\n\nNow, we have to form a word with E and I. The absent letters are: S,L,A,T,M,D,C. So available letters: E, I, B,F,G,H,J,K,N,O,P,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe have limited tries left: 4 guesses remaining (since 2 used).\n\nWe should aim to use common letters and avoid absent ones.\n\nLet me try to think of words with E and I, avoiding S,L,A,T,M,D,C.\n\nSome options:\n- ""PIECE"": but has two E\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but let\'s avoid for now? Also, E appears twice? Additionally, C is absent? But we know C is absent so we cannot use C? In ""piece"", there is C? So no, because C is absent.\n- ""FIERY"": F,I,E,R,Y -> positions: F1, I2, E3, R4, Y5. This uses F and R and Y. Also, E is at position 3 (which is allowed) and I at position 2. We don\'t know about I at position 2? So we can test.\n- ""NEIGH"": N,E,I,G,H -> positions: N1, E2, I3, G4, H5. But E at position 2: we know E cannot be at position 2? Because in guess 2, we had E at 2 and it was wrong. So we cannot put E at 2 again.\n\nSo we must avoid putting E at position 2? Yes.\n\nIn ""FIERY"", E is at position 3? That\'s okay. And I at position 2? That\'s okay.\n\nAnother word: ""QUEEN""? But duplicates? And Q and U? And E at positions 3 and 4? Position 1: Q, position 2: U, position 3: E, position 4: E, position 5: N. But E at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is allowed? But we have two E\'s? And Q and U are available.\n\nBut we also have to consider that E cannot be in position 2 or 5? Here E is at 3 and 4? So okay? But let me check if Q and U are acceptable? Yes, because they are not in the absent list.\n\nBut ""QUEEN"" has duplicate E? And we don\'t know if there are duplicates? However, in the feedback system, duplicates might be treated separately? For example, if the secret word has two E\'s? Then guessing E in a position that has E would get ✓ or - accordingly. But in our case, we don\'t know? But we know there is at least one E.\n\nAlternatively, ""PINEY"": P,I,N,E,Y -> positions: P1, I2, N3, E4, Y5. This uses P, N, E, Y. And E at position 4? That is allowed (since not 2 or 5), and I at position 2? We don\'t know about I at 2? So we can try.\n\nBut note: in Guess 2, medic, we had I at position 4 and it was marked - meaning present but wrong position. So I cannot be at position 4? But we are putting I at position 2 now? Therefore, if the secret word has I at position 2, we get ✓ for I? If not, then we get - meaning I is somewhere else? Either way, we get information.\n\nSimilarly, for E, putting at position 4? We know E must be in 1,3, or4? So if we put E at 4, then if E is at 4 we get ✓; if E is at 1 or 3, we might get -? But wait: if E is at 1 in the secret word, will putting E at 4 still yield -? Yes, because the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.\n\nSo let\'s compare options:\n\nOption 1: FIERY (F,I,E,R,Y)\n  Positions: F1, I2, E3, R4, Y5\n  We test if E is at position 3? And I at position 2? And R is a new common letter.\n\nOption 2: PINEY (P,I,N,E,Y)\n  Positions: P1, I2, N3, E4, Y5\n  Tests: I at 2, E at 4.\n\nBoth seem reasonable. But note: we might also consider words with E at position 1? Because that is a possibility.\n\nFor example: ""EERIE""? Duplicates? Let\'s avoid duplicates.\n\n""ENNUI""? E1,N2,N3,U4,I5? But I at position 5? And duplicates N? Also, we have two N\'s? But we need to know if N is present? Also, E at 1: which is a possibility.\n\nBut we don\'t know about N? So we can test.\n\nHowever, ""ENNUI"" might not be common. Let me choose a more common word.\n\n""ELDER""? But D is absent? From Guess 2: D is absent? So we cannot use D? So ""elder"" is invalid.\n\nHow about ""EMBER""? E,M,B,E,R? But M is absent? So no.\n\n""OWRIE""? Not common.\n\nPerhaps ""EKRIS""? Not a word.\n\nLet me consider one with E at 1: ""ENDOW""? But D and O? D is absent? So no.\n\n""ENVOY"": E1,N2,V3,O4,Y5? This avoids absent letters? Absent: S,L,A,T,M,D,C? So D is absent? But in ""envoys"" we have V,O,Y? And E at 1? And N? \n""ENVOY"" is a word. But note: it does not contain the letter I? But we know the word has I? So we must include I? Otherwise, if we guess without I, then we might miss it? But we know I is present? So we must include I in the guess? Why? Because the word has I? So we cannot ignore it.\n\nYes, we know the secret word has I (because in Guess 2, medic, I got - meaning it is in the word). So we must include both E and I in our next guess? Otherwise we might not get enough information.\n\nTherefore, guesses must include E and I? Because they are present? And we need to locate them.\n\nSo words must include E and I? Yes.\n\nTherefore, FIERY and PINEY are both valid? And they include E and I.\n\nAdditionally, we need to test positions for E and I.\n\nIn PINEY: I at 2, E at 4. We know that I cannot be at position 4? Because it was in Guess 2 at 4 and marked as -. So putting I at 2 now: \n- If I is at 2, then ✓? \n- If not, then we get - meaning I is somewhere else? But we don\'t know where.\n\nSimilarly, E at 4: \n- If E is at 4, then ✓? \n- If E is at 1 or 3, then we get - because it\'s present but in wrong position? But if E is at 1, we put at 4: so -? Similarly for 3.\n\nAnother option: ""INNED""? But E at 5? But we know E cannot be at 5? And also D is absent? So no.\n\n""FINER"": F,I,N,E,R -> positions: F1,I2,N3,E4,R5? This has E at 4? Also, avoids absent letters? Yes: absent letters: S,L,A,T,M,D,C? So F,I,N,E,R are not in absent? But note E at 4? And I at 2? Same as PINEY? But R at 5.\n\nBut ""FINER"" is valid? Yes.\n\nCompared to FIERY: which has E at 3 and R at 4? And Y at 5.\n\nWe might also consider ""WIPER"": W,I,P,E,R -> positions: W1,I2,P3,E4,R5? But same as FINER? But with W and P? We don\'t know if W or P is common? Or R.\n\nPerhaps it\'s better to test new letters? For example, in FIERY we test F,R,Y? In PINEY we test P,N,Y? In FINER we test F,N,R? \n\nBut R was in FIERY? Let me make a decision.\n\nAlternatively: ""NEVER"" has two E\'s? And E at 1 and 4? Position: E1? Allowed. Then E4? Also allowed? But we don\'t know if duplicates? And V is available? But ""never"" has E twice? And we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Moreover, we have I? We must include I? So ""never"" doesn\'t include I? So no.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll choose between FIERY and PINEY.\n\nLet me pick FIERY because it tests E at position 3? In case E is at 3? And we haven\'t tested position 3 for E? Similarly, I at 2? And we haven\'t tested I at 2? Also, R at 4? And Y at 5? So it avoids positions we already know are wrong for E? But wait, we know E is not at 2 or 5? But at 3? We haven\'t tested.\n\nNote: In the first guess, we had slate which had no position 3 E? So we haven\'t tested position 3 for E? So that\'s new.\n\nSimilarly, PINEY tests E at 4? Also new? Because we haven\'t tested E at 4? Only at 2 and 5? So both are new positions? Position 3 (FIERY) and position 4 (PINEY).\n\nBut we also have to consider that for I: in PINEY we put I at 2? Which we haven\'t tested? And in FIERY also I at 2? Same for both? So that\'s same.\n\nTherefore, FIERY is F,I,E,R,Y? And PINEY is P,I,N,E,Y.\n\nBoth are fine. I\'ll go with FIERY because it uses R? Which is common? Or Y? \n\nActually, let me search for words without Y? Because Y is less common? Maybe? But we have to use available letters.\n\nBut I\'ll go with FIERY.\n\nSo next guess: FIERY\n\nBut note: FIERY is 5 letters? And valid? Yes.\n\nLet me confirm spelling? F-I-E-R-Y? Yes.\n\nSo:\n<guess>fiery</guess>### Analysis from Previous Feedback\n- **Guess 1: ""slate"" → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)**  \n  - E is in the secret word but not in position 5.  \n  - S, L, A, T are **absent**.  \n- **Guess 2: ""medic"" → M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)**  \n  - E is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was misplaced).  \n  - I is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was misplaced).  \n  - M, D, C are **absent**.  \n- **Aggregated insights**:  \n  - **Present letters**: E,  \n  - **Absent letters**: S, L, A, T, M, D, C (so guesses must avoid these).  \n- **Positional constraints for E**:  \n  - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (directly tested).  \n  - Must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.  \n- **Positional constraints for I**:  \n  - Cannot be in position 4 (tested), so must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.  \n- **Strategy for new guess**:  \n  - Must include **both E and I** (known present letters).  \n  - Avoid absent letters (S, L, A, T, M, D, C).  \n  - Test E in position 3 (untested valid position) and I in position 2 (untested valid position).  \n  - Prioritize high-frequency letters (e.g., R, N, F, Y) to maximize new information.  \n  - **Selected word: ""FIERY""**  \n    - F (position 1), I (position 2), E (position 3), R (position 4), Y (position 5).  \n    - Tests E in position 3 and I in position 2.  \n    - Uses new common letters (F, R, Y) not previously tested.\n\n<guess>fiery</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)\nGuess 3: fiery -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) E(-) R(-) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the third guess: ""fiery"" -> F(x) I(✓) E(-) R(-) Y(x)\n\nInterpretation:\n- I(✓) : The letter I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2). Since we placed I at position 2 and it\'s correct, the secret word has I at position 2.\n- E(-) : The letter E is in the word but not in position 3 (where we placed it). So E is present but not at position 3.\n- R(-) : The letter R is in the word but not in position 4 (where we placed it). So R is present but not at position 4.\n- F(x) and Y(x): F and Y are not in the word.\n\nAdditionally, we know from previous guesses:\n- From Guess 1: E is present (but not at position 5) and S,L,A,T absent.\n- From Guess 2: E is present (but not at position 2), and M,D,C absent, and I present (but not at position 4; now we know it\'s at position 2).\n\nSo summary:\n- Correct position: Position 2 is I.\n- Present letters: E, R (and I, which is placed at position 2).\n- Absent letters: S, L, A, T, M, D, C, F, Y.\n\nNow, E must be in the word but not at position 2, 3, or 5. Since position 2 is occupied by I, and we know E can\'t be at 3 or 5, so E must be at position 1 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, R is present but not at position 4 (from this guess). So R can be at position 1, 3, or 5? But note: position 1 might be E? Or R? Also, position 4 is still available for R? Wait: we placed R at position 4 and it was marked ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at position 4. So R cannot be at 4? It can be at 1, 3, or 5? But position 1 might be taken by E or R? Position 3 is available? Position 5 is available.\n\nThe secret word structure:\nPosition 1: ? (must be one of E or R or another letter)\nPosition 2: I (fixed)\nPosition 3: ? \nPosition 4: ? \nPosition 5: ?\n\nBut E must be at position 1 or 4? Because it can\'t be at 2,3,5. Similarly, R must be at position 1,3, or 5? But not at 4.\n\nWe need to form a word that has I in position 2, E at 1 or 4, R at 1,3, or 5? And avoid all absent letters: S,L,A,T,M,D,C,F,Y.\n\nAvailable letters: besides E,R,I (which we know are in), we need two more? Or duplicates? We don\'t know? We haven\'t encountered duplicates so far? So we assume? But let\'s see.\n\nActually, we know the secret word has E, R, and I? And there might be two more letters? But we have 5 positions. Since we know three distinct letters? E, R, I? Then two more? Or duplicates? But we haven\'t found duplicates? So perhaps no duplicates? Or we don\'t know? But we\'ll try without duplicates first.\n\nSo available letters: E,R,I must be used, and we need two more letters from remaining unused: B,G,H,J,K,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z? \n\nAlso, we know E must be at position 1 or 4? And R must be at position 1,3, or 5? But note: if E is at position 1, then R cannot be at position 1? And vice versa? So possible cases:\n\nCase 1: E is at position 1\nThen R must be at position 3 or 5? (since not at 4 and not at 1 because occupied by E? Or could R be at 1? No, because E is at 1? So R at 3 or 5.\n\nCase 2: E is at position 4\nThen position 1 is free? So R could be at 1? Or at 3 or 5? Also, position 4 is taken by E.\n\nNow, we need a word that fits? And we have to choose one? Also, we have two other letters? How to choose?\n\nWe can list words that begin with E and have I at position 2? And use R? Or words that have E at position 4 and I at 2? And use R?\n\nAdditionally, we need to guess? Since we have limited tries? We want to test both possibilities? But we have one guess now? Fourth guess? Then after we get more information.\n\nBut maybe we can choose a word that covers common possibilities.\n\nLet me think of words fitting the cases.\n\nCase 1: E at position 1\nSecret word: E, I at 2? Then what? \nPattern: E I ? ? ? \nWith R at position 3 or 5? And another letter? Plus R.\n\nSo, if R at position 3: E I R ? ?\nThen we need two more letters? But we know R is only one? So the rest? Words like ""EIRIE""? But that\'s duplicate E? And E at 1 and 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5? So position 5 cannot be E. So that\'s out.\n\n""EIRS""? Not 5 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\n""EIRIE""? But E at 1 and at 5? But E at 5 forbidden? Because from first guess: E cannot be at 5? So no.\n\n""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T? But we have G,H,T? T was absent from guess 1? Wait: T is absent? Yes, T(x) from slate? So we cannot use T? So not.\n\n""EIBEN""? Not a word.\n\n""EIDER"": but D is absent? D(x) from guess 2? So D absent.\n\n""EIKED""? Not common? E at 1? And then? Also, E at 1? Position 1: E, 2: I, 3: K, 4: E, 5: D? But D absent? So invalid because D is absent.\n\nAlternatively, R at position 5? Then: E I ? ? R\n\nWords: ""EIDER"" again? D absent? Not.\n\n""EIGER"": E,I,G,E,R? That has E at 1 and 4? Aha! But then the word would be E,I,G,E,R? Spelling? Yes: EIGER? But commonly spelled? Actually, ""Eiger"" is a proper noun? But we\'ll assume it\'s valid? Because the rules say ""valid 5-letter English word""?\n\nAlso, R at position 5? That works? But in the word ""eiger"": positions: E1, I2, G3, E4, R5? So E at 1 and 4? But we know E must be present? And here we have two E\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates? However, we have E at position 1? And E at position 4? But we also know E cannot be at position 5? But not at 1? We don\'t know? It\'s allowed? And E at 4? Also allowed? Because we haven\'t tested E at 4? Only we have tested it? In this word, E at 4? We never put E at 4 before? So we don\'t know? \n\nBut note: in the feedback for Guess 3: we put E at position 3 and got ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at 3? So it\'s fine? But if the secret word has E at 4, that will be fine? But we also have E at position 1? So duplicate? The secret word might have two E\'s? \n\nBut ""eiger"" might be acceptable? Let me find a better word.\n\nAnother common word: ""RIPER""? But R at 1? Then E at 4? But we are in case 1? We are considering E at 1? So not.\n\nFor case 1: E at 1, R at 5, and middle letters? Without forbidden ones.\n\nConsider: ""EIVER""? Not a word.\n\n""EIXED""? No.\n\nPerhaps not common? Let\'s assume no duplicates? Then E at 1? Then the secret word has exactly one E? And it must be at 1? Then R would be the other letter? And what about position 3 and 4? They cannot be E? So we need two other letters? But we have R? Which must be at 3 or 5? And we need another letter.\n\nAlternatively, let me look for case 2: E at position 4? Then the word: ? I ? E ? \n\nAnd R present? And can be at 1,3, or 5?\n\nAlso, avoid absent letters.\n\nFor example: words with pattern _ I ? E _\n\nCommon words: ""BIGGER"" too long? 5-letter: ""PIPED"" is 5? But D absent? Not? D is absent? So no D.\n\n""MINED""? M,D absent? Not.\n\n""WIPED""? D absent? Not.\n\n""LIBER""? L absent? From guess 1? So no.\n\n""RIVER"": R at position 1? I at 2? Position 3: V? Position 4: E? Position 5: R? But then R is duplicated? And it has E at position 4? That\'s good? Also R at position 1 and 5? But we haven\'t ruled out duplicates? But we have R present? And we got R(-) when we put R at 4? So if R were duplicated? Then putting R at 4 might show? Or not? Actually, our guess fiery had R at 4? And if secret word has R at 1 and 5? Then R at 4 should be marked absent? But the feedback said R(-)? Meaning R is in the word? So R is present? But it doesn\'t specify how many? So it could be duplicated? But in the feedback, we have R(-)? So the secret word has at least one R? And since we put R at 4 and it\'s not there? So R is elsewhere? Either at 1,3, or 5? Or duplicated? But if duplicated, we don\'t know positions? \n\nFor ""RIVER"": \n- Position 1: R? If we put R at 1? And the secret word has R at 1? Then ✓? If it has R at 5? Then R at 1 would be marked - if R is also at 5? Or only if R is at 1 is wrong? Actually, the rules: the feedback symbol is per letter? And it\'s based on the occurrence? If a letter is duplicated, then each guess letter is compared? But typically in such games, if you have duplicates? But our feedback only says for that position? \n\nFor example: secret word RIVER? Guess: FIERY? Then F vs R? F:x? Then I vs I? ✓? Then E vs V? E:x? Because E not in word? Wait: RIVER has no E? But we know E is present? So secret word cannot be ""river""? Because E is missing? \n\nWe know E must be present? So ""river"" has R,I,V,E,R? So E at position 4? And R at 1 and 5? So it has E? So yes.\n\nBut E is at position 4? And we haven\'t tested E at 4? So if we guess ""river"", then:\nPosition 1: R? If R is at 1 or 5? But we placed R at 1? Then if secret word has R at 1? then ✓? Or if not? But since we got R(-) in Guess 3 at position 4? We know R is not at 4? But at 1? If we put at 1 in this guess? We might get ✓.\n\nSimilarly, position 4: E? And if secret word has E at 4? then ✓? If it has E at 1? but we are putting E at 4? But E cannot be at 1 because we are in case 2? We are assuming E at 4? So if E is at 4, we get ✓? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut for ""RIVER"", if we guess we would get:\n\nIf secret word ""RIVER"": \nR at position 1: in secret, R is at position 1? So ✓? \nI at position 2: ✓? \nPosition 3: we guess V? But secret word has V? At 3? So if R is at 1? And I at 2? V at 3? E at 4? R at 5? \n\nThen guess: RIVER? Then compare:\nPosition 1: R? Matches? ✓.\nPosition 2: I? Matches? ✓.\nPosition 3: V? Secret has V? And in correct position? So ✓.\nPosition 4: E? Matches E? ✓.\nPosition 5: R? Matches R? ✓.\n\nBut we haven\'t got any feedback? We are guessing. \n\nBut problem: we know that from Guess 3, we got E(-) for position 3? And secret word ""river"" has no letter at position 3 that is E? So that\'s okay? Because we had E at 3? But it\'s not? So x? Or what? In this case, in Guess 3: we guessed ""fiery"" at position 3: E? And secret ""river"" has V at position 3? So E is not at position 3? But E is in the secret word (at position 4)? So the feedback for E should be ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Because there is an E? Though at different position? \n\nYes: so for fiery:\n- F: x (not in secret)\n- I: ✓ (correct position)\n- E: - (present but wrong position, because E is at position 4, not 3)\n- R: - (present but wrong position? Secret has R at position 1 and 5? But we placed R at position 4? Which is E? So R is not? What letter at position 4 in secret? It is E? So R is at position 4? Secret has E? So R vs E? Not matching? And R is at position 4? Secret at position 4: E? So R should be marked? Since secret has R, but not at position 4? And not at position 4? So marked with ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Because even if R is duplicated? It can be counted? \n\nActually, when there are duplicates, it gets complex? But typically? In Wordle? Each guessed letter matches only one position? And extras can be marked differently? But our rule says: ""-"" means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position? And it doesn\'t care about duplicates? \n\nIn the secret word ""RIVER"": it has two R\'s? At position 1 and 5? \nIn guess ""FIERY"": R is at position 4? \nThe secret: position 1: R (matched to guessed R at position 4? Not positionally)? We have to assign? But typically? The algorithm might match exact positions first? Then for the leftover? It matches in the word? But in this case? For the R in guess? Position 4? Secret position 4 has E? So not matching? Then it looks: secret has two R\'s? At position 1 and 5? Both already not matched to exact? So one R can be matched to the guessed R? So since R is present? But at position 1 or 5? Not position 4? So marked with ""-""? \n\nAnd E at position 3? Secret has E at position 4? So E is present and marked with ""-""? \n\nSo our feedback: F(x), I(✓), E(-), R(-), Y(x) would be consistent? \n\nTherefore, ""RIVER"" could be a candidate? \n\nBut we must include the present letters: E and R and I? With I at position 2? And E at position 4? R? We don\'t know? But in ""RIVER"", R is at 1 and 5? And E at 4? Avoids forbidden letters? \n\nBut now, we want to guess a word? That includes E and R? And I at 2? And we need to solve? \n\nAlso, from Guess 3? We now know that I is fixed at position 2? So we might guess ""RIVER"" as the next word? But it might not be? \n\nSimilarly, other words: ""NICER""? N,I,C,E,R? But C absent? So no? C is absent? \n\n""RIDER""? D absent? Not. \n\n""RISER""? S absent? Not. \n\n""RIVER""? As above? \n\n""WRECK""? W,R,E,C,K? C absent? Not. \n\n""ROUSE""? But S,O,U,E,R? S absent? And O? But we don\'t care? But S absent? Forbidden? So cannot?\n\n""ROBED""? B,D,O,E,R? D absent? B? Available? But D absent? So invalid because D absent.\n\nAfter trying, ""RIVER"" seems acceptable? And uses common letters? But does it have E at position 4? And I at 2? The pattern: position 4 is E? Yes? That\'s good? But we are not sure if E is at 4 or at 1? \n\nIn Guess 3: we had R(-) at position 4? So in secret word? Position 4 is NOT R? Because R is present elsewhere? \n\nSimilarly, E(-) at position 3? So position 3 is not E? \n\nSo the secret word:\n- Position 2: I (fixed)\n- Position 3: cannot be E? And we know it can be R? Since R can be at position 3? \n- Position 4: cannot be R? And it could be E? \n- Position 1: could be E or R or other? \n- Position 5: could be R or other? \n\nSimilarly, we know position 3 is not E? 4 is not R? 2 is I? 1 and 5? \n\nNow, with ""RIVER"": we assume position 4 is E? Position 1 is R? Position 3 is V? Position 5 is R? \n\nBut we are not sure? We can also guess a word that has E at position 1 and R at position 5? For example? \n\nWhat word? ""E"" at 1, I at 2? Then? And E cannot be at 3 or 4? But position 4? Can be E? But we don\'t know? So if E at 1? Then the other positions: not E? So position 3,4,5? No E? But we know E is present? And we placed that at 1? So the only E is at position 1? Then we need R at position 3 or5? And position 4? \n\nFor example: ""EIR"" something? But we don\'t have T? S? Etc? All those are absent? So: ""EIR"" ?\n\n""EIBRY""? But Y absent? Y(x) from Guess 3? So no.\n\n""EIGRE""? But R? And E at the end? E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? So wrong.\n\n""EIGHT""? T absent? No.\n\nNo good word with E at 1? Without duplicates? \n\nPerhaps with duplicate? But I cannot use? \n\nTherefore, probably the secret word has E at position 4? So case 2 is more likely? \n\nThus, words like ""RIVER""? \n\nOr ""INNER""? But not I at position 2? We must have I at position 2? We know position 2 is I? So ""RIVER"" has I at 2? So it\'s good.\n\nAnother word: ""PIGEON""? Too long? 6 letters? Not? \n\n""WIPER"": W,I,P,E,R? Position 1:W, 2:I, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R? This has E at 4? R at 5? And avoids absent letters? W,P are available? \n\nBut also: ""hiver""? But H? Or ""giver""? G,I,V,E,R? G available?\n\nBut ""GIVER"": position 1:G, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R? \n\nSimilarly, ""RIVER"" has R at 1? Which might be R? \n\nWe can guess ""WIPER"" or ""GIVER"" or ""RIVER""? \n\nBut note: we also have the letter R present? And in ""WIPER""? R at position 5? We had R marked - when at position 4? Now we put at position 5? If R is at position 5? Then we might get ✓? \n\nSimilarly for E at position 4? If it is correct, we get ✓? \n\nAlso, if we guess ""RIVER""? Then we risk? If it is not? But it has two R\'s? And we don\'t know? \n\nPerhaps we should avoid duplicates? So guess a word without duplicate and with E at 4? And R at position 5? Like ""WIPER"", ""GIVER"", etc? \n\nLet me choose ""WIPER"" because it uses W which is less common? Or ""GIVER""?\n\nActually, ""RIVER"" is more common? And we\'ll know? \n\nBut to test? We choose ""RIVER""? \n\nBut we also have option of ""BIGGER""? Too long? \n\n5-letter words: ""JIVER"" not common? \n\nHence, I choose ""RIVER"" as the guess? \n\nBut note: ""RIVER"" has two R\'s? And we have R marked? \n\nIn our feedback? When we put R at position 4? We got -? Meaning R is present? But that doesn\'t prevent duplicates? \n\nSo we go ahead? \n\nTherefore, next guess: RIVER\n\nBut let me see if there is a word without duplicate R? \n\nFor example: ""QUIRE"" has Q? And U? But Q? Position: Q,U,I,R,E? But then R at position 4? And we know position 4 cannot be R? Because in Guess 3: R at 4 got ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but not there? So if we put R at position 4 again? It would be wrong? But in secret? Position 4 is not R? R is at other position? So ""QUIRE"" has R at 4? Which is not allowed? Because we know R is not at position 4? \n\nSimilarly, for any word, we should not put R at position 4? \n\nAnd ""RIVER"" has R at position 1 and 5? And position 4 is E? So not R? So it\'s fine? \n\nSimilarly, ""GIVER"" has G at 1, I at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So no R at 4? And R at 5? \n\nBoth ""GIVER"" and ""RIVER"" have E at 4? \n\nAnd ""WIPER"" same: W,I,P,E,R? Position 5: R? \n\nWe can choose one? I will choose ""GIVER"" because we haven\'t tested G? Or ""RIVER"" uses R and V? \n\nPerhaps equally? I\'ll go with ""GIVER"".\n\nSo guessed word: GIVER\n\nBut let me think again: what if E is at position 1? and not at 4? Then secret word has E at 1? So ""GIVER"" would have G at 1 instead? And E at 4? Then if E is at 1? Then in ""GIVER"", position 1: G is compared to E? x? And E at position 4? Secret has E at 1? So E is marked -? But that\'s still possible? \n\nWhereas if we guess ""RIVER"", and if E is at position 1? Then position 1: R vs E? R? Not E? So x? And E at position 4: secret may have E at 1? So E at 4: x? Or if secret has E at 1? And no E elsewhere? Then E at 4 should be x? Because E is only at position 1? \n\nBut we know E must be present? So in ""RIVER"": position 1: R? Secret? If E is at position 1? Then R at 1: not matching? And since secret has E at 1? Then at position 4: E in guess vs secret position 4: what? We don\'t know? But if secret has only one E at position 1? Then E in guess at position 4 is not? So marked x? Then R at position 5: secret has R? Or not? But we would get feedback? \n\nBut if we guess ""RIVER"" and the secret has E at 1? Then we get E missing? But we already know E must be in the word? So it\'s a contradiction? \n\nActually, no: the secret word could have other letters? But we guess and it may not have E? But we were told E is present? From earlier feedback? \n\nYes, from Guess 1: E present? Guess 2: E present? Guess 3: E present? So E must be in the word? \n\nTherefore, if we guess ""RIVER"", and secret has E at position 1? Then at position 1: we would have R? Not E? So x? Then position 4: E? Secret at position 4: ? If not E? Then E should be marked x? If secret has E only at position 1? Then E at position 4: not E? So x? And since E is in secret? But at position 1? It should show in feedback? How?\n\nThe feedback for ""RIVER"" if secret has E at position 1, I at 2, etc: \nPosition 1: guessed R vs actual E: not match? But E is in the secret? And at position 1? So for R? Since R is not at position 1? And secret has no R? Or R elsewhere? But if secret has R at position 5? Then R? \n\nFor instance: suppose secret word: E I G H R? \nThen guess ""RIVER"": \nPos1: R vs E: not match? And R is in secret? At position 5? So R at position 1- is marked ""-""? \nPos2: I match? ✓.\nPos3: V vs G? x because V not in secret.\nPos4: E vs H? not match? But E is in the secret? At position 1? So E at position 4 should be marked ""-"" meaning present but wrong position.\nPos5: R vs R? match? ✓.\n\nBut we don\'t know secret? \n\nSimilarly, if secret is E I ? ? ?, and we guess RIVER? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nBut in our case? We can guess? \n\nBut for efficiency? A word that uses more new letters? \n\nAlso? We have only two unknowns? Essentially? Because E must be at 1 or 4? And R at 1,3,5? But position 1? Cannot have both? So if E at position 1? Then position 1 is E? And R can be at 3 or 5? \n\nIf E at position 4? Then position 4 is E? And R at 1,3, or 5? \n\nThen the other positions? Position 3 must be a letter? And position 4 is fixed if E is there? \n\nSo we need to test which case? \n\nFor example, guess a word that has E at position 1? Then we\'ll know? \n\nBut earlier? We couldn\'t find a valid word with E at position 1? Without forbidden letters? \n\nPerhaps ""ENRIK""? Not valid? \n\nOr ""ENROL""? But L? L absent? Or ""ENRAP""? Not valid? \n\nAlternatively, guess with E at position 4? And include common letters? \n\nLet me choose ""GIVER"" as the next guess? Because it has G and V? New letters? \n\nAnd it fits: position 1:G, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R? \n\nSo guessed word: GIVER\n\nWe\'ll get feedback? If E at position 4 is correct? We get ✓? Else if E at position 4 is not? But if E is at position 1? then we get E at position 4 marked? As ""-"" because E is present but at 1? \n\nBut also, position 1: if G is not in word? x? \n\nSimilarly, position 5: R? Might be ✓ or - or x? \n\nSo it will give us information? \n\nWe hope to solve? Or get closer? \n\nSo:\n\n<guess>giver</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n- **Guess 1 (slate)**: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)  \n  - E is in the secret word but not in position 5.  \n  - S, L, A, T are **absent**.  \n- **Guess 2 (medic)**: M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)  \n  - E is in the word but not in position 2.  \n  - I is in the word but not in position 4.  \n  - M, D, C are **absent**.  \n- **Guess 3 (fiery)**: F(x) I(✓) E(-) R(-) Y(x)  \n  - I is **correct** and fixed in position 2.  \n  - E is in the word but not in position 3.  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 4.  \n  - F, Y are **absent**.  \n- **Aggregated insights**:  \n  - **Present letters**: E, I, R  \n  - **Absent letters**: S, L, A, T, M, D, C, F, Y  \n  - **Positional constraints**:  \n    - Position 2 is I (✓ confirmed).  \n    - E cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → must be in position 1 or 4.  \n    - R cannot be in position 4 → must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  \n  - The secret word must include E and R, with at least one of each.  \n\n### Strategy for New Guess\n- **Goal**: Narrow down positions for E and R using available letters.  \n  - Option: Prioritize E in position 4 (untested) and R in position 5 (untested), while avoiding absent letters and invalid positions.  \n- **Word selection**:  \n  - Must start with a letter not absent (e.g., G, H, N, V) to test alternative patterns.  \n  - Position 1: Untested letter (e.g., G) if E is not at position 1.  \n  - Position 4: E (to test position 4) since E cannot be at positions 2, 3, or 5.  \n  - Position 5: R (to test position 5) since R cannot be at position 4.  \n- **Selected word: GIVER**  \n  - Structure: G (pos1), I (pos2, ✓), V (pos3), E (pos4), R (pos5).  \n  - Tests E in position 4 and R in position 5.  \n  - Uses new common letters (G, V) to gather additional insights.\n\n<guess>giver</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) D(x) I(-) C(x)\nGuess 3: fiery -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) E(-) R(-) Y(x)\nGuess 4: giver -> FEEDBACK: G(x) I(✓) V(-) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have new feedback from Guess 4: ""giver"" -> G(x) I(✓) V(-) E(✓) R(✓)

Interpretation:
- I(✓): As before, position 2 is I.
- E(✓): E is in the correct position. Position 4 is E (since we placed E at position 4).
- R(✓): R is in the correct position. Position 5 is R (since we placed R at position 5).
- V(-): V is in the word but not in position 3 (where we placed it).
- G(x): G is not in the word.

So, now we know:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)
- Position 3: Cannot be V (because V(-)), but V is present in the word? Since V(-): it means V is in the word, but not at position 3.
- Position 1: We don't know? And it cannot be G (absent), and must be a letter not in absent list.

We also have:
- V is present but not at position 3? So V could be at position 1? Because position 4 and 5 are fixed? Positions: 
  1: ? 
  2: I 
  3: ? 
  4: E 
  5: R 

But we placed V at position 3? And got V(-) meaning V is in the secret word? But not at position 3? So V must be at position 1? Because it cannot be at 3,4,5? 4 and 5 are E and R? So position 1 must be V? Because there's no other position? Unless duplicated? But we have only five positions? 

Therefore: secret word must have V at position 1? Because:
- Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
- 2: I (fixed)
- 4: E (fixed)
- 5: R (fixed)
- And V is in the word? And it cannot be at position 3? So only position 1 is left? So position 1 must be V? 

But we placed V at position 3? And got V(-) meaning it is in the word? But in the secret? If V is at position 1? Then that's fine? And position 3 is some other letter?

Also?: position 3: we don't know? But it cannot be V? So what is it? 

So the secret word is: V at position 1? And position 3 is unknown? But we must finish the game? 

Actually, we have only one letter unknown? Position 3? 

And we know that V is present? And fixed at position 1? Because position 1 is open? And V must go there? Because if not? Then V would have to be at positions that are fixed? But positions 2,4,5 are fixed? So V must be at position 1? 

Therefore: the secret word is V ? E R? With position 2: I? Position 3 unknown? 

So V I ? E R? 

And ? must be a letter? Which is not absent? And we don't know what it is? 

But we must guess the word? 

Possible words: V I ? E R? 

For example: ""VICER"" ? But ""vicer"" not a word? 
""VODER""? ""VOTER""? But T absent? T was absent? 
""VISER""? S absent? 
""VIPER"": V,I,P,E,R? P is available? And ""viper"" is a word? 
""VIGOR"": V,I,G,O,R? But G absent? From Guess 4: G(x)? So G absent? 
""VIMEN""?: Not a word? 
""VINAL""?: L absent? 
""VINER""?: V,I,N,E,R? N available? 

But wait? We already have the feedback? And the secret word has V at position 1? I at 2? E at 4? R at 5? And position 3 unknown? We need to guess? 

The only available position is position 3? 

And from feedback? We know that V? Is present? And we just deduced it must be at position 1? So the secret word starts with V? 

Therefore? We guess words like VIPER? VINER? VIXEN? etc? But we need one try? 

Wait? We have 2 guesses left? Because we used 4? So 2 left? 

Yes? Initially 6 tries? So guess 5th? 

But we can guess? 

However? We have feedback that V(-) at 3? Meaning? If we put V at 3? Secret has V? But not there? And with positions fixed? Position 1 is available? So it must be there? 

So? we know the secret word has letter? V,I, position3? E,R? 

And position3 is one letter? Which we tried V? and it wasn't? So it is not V? So another letter? 

Let me list possible words? Available letters? Avoiding absent ones? 

Absent: S,L,A,T,M,D,C,F,Y,G? 

We also have known absent from guesses? 

Guess 1: S,L,A,T? 
Guess 2: M,D,C? 
Guess 3: F,Y? 
Guess 4: G? 

So absent: S,L,A,T,M,D,C,F,Y,G? 

Available: B,H,I (but I fixed),E (fixed at4),R (fixed at5),V? but V must be used at1? and letters left: B,H,J,K,N,O,P,Q,U,W,X,Z? 

Now? What words? Pattern V I _ E R? 

Possible: 
- ""VIBER""? Not standard? 
- ""VICER""? Not common? 
- ""VIPER"": P? Available? Word? 
- ""VINER"": N? Available? Not sure meaning? 
- ""VIXER""? Not word? 
- ""VIKER""? Not? 

""VIPER"" is a common word? Meaning snake? 

Also? ""VIGOR"" has G? But G absent? So no? 

""VINER"": a worker in vineyard? But less common? 

""VIPER"": standard English? 

Also? ""VIFER""? Not? 

Or ""VIVER"": but V? But V already used? 

No? The word ""viver"" may not exist? 

So ""VIPER""? should be acceptable? 

Therefore? we guess ""VIPER"" as the next word? 

But we don't know? We can guess? And if wrong? We try another letter? 

Because we have two tries? 

Alternatively? We might also consider ""VINER""? But I prefer ""VIPER""? 

But let me see? 

In Guess 4 we had ""GIVER""? Position 3: V? Got? V(-)? So secret has V? But not at3? Therefore? at position3? It is some other letter? 

So in ""VIPER"": positions: V1,I2,P3,E4,R5? 

If we guess? Then the feedback? We hope P is correct? 

But if secret word is ""VIPER"" then? Position 3: P? Should be ✓? 

Similarly? If it is ""VINER""? Position 3: N? 

We can guess ""VIPER""? If wrong? Then next? 

But let me see if we can deduce? 

Actually? We have one more piece? In Guess 2: medic? We had I(-) at position4? But that was incorrect? But now? We know position4 is E? So? We don't care? 

Also? In Guess 3: we had E at3? Which was wrong? 

But no other constraints? 

Thus? ""VIPER"" is a strong candidate? 

Let me confirm? 

Absent letters: P not absent? So can be used? 

Therefore? 

Next guess: VIPER

### Analysis of Feedback from Guess 4
- **Guess 4 (giver)**: G(x) I(✓) V(-) E(✓) R(✓)  
  - **Confirms**:
    - Position 2: I (✓, fixed).
    - Position 4: E (✓, fixed).
    - Position 5: R (✓, fixed).
    - V is **present** in the word but **not** at position 3.
  - **New insights**:
    - G is **absent**.
    - V must occupy position 1 (only untested position left that can logically hold V) because positions 2, 4, and 5 are fixed, and V cannot be at position 3 (via feedback).
    - Position 3 must be filled by a letter not yet excluded and not V (since V is at position 1). Available letters: B, H, J, K, N, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Z (avoiding absent letters S, L, A, T, M, D, C, F, Y, G).

### Deduced Secret Word Pattern
- Known: **V (pos1), I (pos2), ? (pos3), E (pos4), R (pos5)**
- **Candidates for position 3**: Prioritize high-frequency letters (e.g., N, P, O). Word must be valid English.
  - Strong candidate: **""VIPER""** (V-I-P-E-R), with P in position 3:
    - P is common and untested.
    - ""VIPER"" matches pattern.
  - Alternatives (if ""VIPER"" fails): VINER (N), VOWER (O/W), but ""VIPER"" is more frequent.

Strategy: Guess **""VIPER""** to test position 3 with P. If incorrect, position 3 can be refined with the final guess.

<guess>viper</guess>",viper,"We have new feedback from Guess 4: ""giver"" -> G(x) I(✓) V(-) E(✓) R(✓)

Interpretation:
- I(✓): As before, position 2 is I.
- E(✓): E is in the correct position. Position 4 is E (since we placed E at position 4).
- R(✓): R is in the correct position. Position 5 is R (since we placed R at position 5).
- V(-): V is in the word but not in position 3 (where we placed it).
- G(x): G is not in the word.

So, now we know:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)
- Position 3: Cannot be V (because V(-)), but V is present in the word? Since V(-): it means V is in the word, but not at position 3.
- Position 1: We don't know? And it cannot be G (absent), and must be a letter not in absent list.

We also have:
- V is present but not at position 3? So V could be at position 1? Because position 4 and 5 are fixed? Positions: 
  1: ? 
  2: I 
  3: ? 
  4: E 
  5: R 

But we placed V at position 3? And got V(-) meaning V is in the secret word? But not at position 3? So V must be at position 1? Because it cannot be at 3,4,5? 4 and 5 are E and R? So position 1 must be V? Because there's no other position? Unless duplicated? But we have only five positions? 

Therefore: secret word must have V at position 1? Because:
- Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
- 2: I (fixed)
- 4: E (fixed)
- 5: R (fixed)
- And V is in the word? And it cannot be at position 3? So only position 1 is left? So position 1 must be V? 

But we placed V at position 3? And got V(-) meaning it is in the word? But in the secret? If V is at position 1? Then that's fine? And position 3 is some other letter?

Also?: position 3: we don't know? But it cannot be V? So what is it? 

So the secret word is: V at position 1? And position 3 is unknown? But we must finish the game? 

Actually, we have only one letter unknown? Position 3? 

And we know that V is present? And fixed at position 1? Because position 1 is open? And V must go there? Because if not? Then V would have to be at positions that are fixed? But positions 2,4,5 are fixed? So V must be at position 1? 

Therefore: the secret word is V ? E R? With position 2: I? Position 3 unknown? 

So V I ? E R? 

And ? must be a letter? Which is not absent? And we don't know what it is? 

But we must guess the word? 

Possible words: V I ? E R? 

For example: ""VICER"" ? But ""vicer"" not a word? 
""VODER""? ""VOTER""? But T absent? T was absent? 
""VISER""? S absent? 
""VIPER"": V,I,P,E,R? P is available? And ""viper"" is a word? 
""VIGOR"": V,I,G,O,R? But G absent? From Guess 4: G(x)? So G absent? 
""VIMEN""?: Not a word? 
""VINAL""?: L absent? 
""VINER""?: V,I,N,E,R? N available? 

But wait? We already have the feedback? And the secret word has V at position 1? I at 2? E at 4? R at 5? And position 3 unknown? We need to guess? 

The only available position is position 3? 

And from feedback? We know that V? Is present? And we just deduced it must be at position 1? So the secret word starts with V? 

Therefore? We guess words like VIPER? VINER? VIXEN? etc? But we need one try? 

Wait? We have 2 guesses left? Because we used 4? So 2 left? 

Yes? Initially 6 tries? So guess 5th? 

But we can guess? 

However? We have feedback that V(-) at 3? Meaning? If we put V at 3? Secret has V? But not there? And with positions fixed? Position 1 is available? So it must be there? 

So? we know the secret word has letter? V,I, position3? E,R? 

And position3 is one letter? Which we tried V? and it wasn't? So it is not V? So another letter? 

Let me list possible words? Available letters? Avoiding absent ones? 

Absent: S,L,A,T,M,D,C,F,Y,G? 

We also have known absent from guesses? 

Guess 1: S,L,A,T? 
Guess 2: M,D,C? 
Guess 3: F,Y? 
Guess 4: G? 

So absent: S,L,A,T,M,D,C,F,Y,G? 

Available: B,H,I (but I fixed),E (fixed at4),R (fixed at5),V? but V must be used at1? and letters left: B,H,J,K,N,O,P,Q,U,W,X,Z? 

Now? What words? Pattern V I _ E R? 

Possible: 
- ""VIBER""? Not standard? 
- ""VICER""? Not common? 
- ""VIPER"": P? Available? Word? 
- ""VINER"": N? Available? Not sure meaning? 
- ""VIXER""? Not word? 
- ""VIKER""? Not? 

""VIPER"" is a common word? Meaning snake? 

Also? ""VIGOR"" has G? But G absent? So no? 

""VINER"": a worker in vineyard? But less common? 

""VIPER"": standard English? 

Also? ""VIFER""? Not? 

Or ""VIVER"": but V? But V already used? 

No? The word ""viver"" may not exist? 

So ""VIPER""? should be acceptable? 

Therefore? we guess ""VIPER"" as the next word? 

But we don't know? We can guess? And if wrong? We try another letter? 

Because we have two tries? 

Alternatively? We might also consider ""VINER""? But I prefer ""VIPER""? 

But let me see? 

In Guess 4 we had ""GIVER""? Position 3: V? Got? V(-)? So secret has V? But not at3? Therefore? at position3? It is some other letter? 

So in ""VIPER"": positions: V1,I2,P3,E4,R5? 

If we guess? Then the feedback? We hope P is correct? 

But if secret word is ""VIPER"" then? Position 3: P? Should be ✓? 

Similarly? If it is ""VINER""? Position 3: N? 

We can guess ""VIPER""? If wrong? Then next? 

But let me see if we can deduce? 

Actually? We have one more piece? In Guess 2: medic? We had I(-) at position4? But that was incorrect? But now? We know position4 is E? So? We don't care? 

Also? In Guess 3: we had E at3? Which was wrong? 

But no other constraints? 

Thus? ""VIPER"" is a strong candidate? 

Let me confirm? 

Absent letters: P not absent? So can be used? 

Therefore? 

Next guess: VIPER### Analysis of Feedback from Guess 4
- **Guess 4 (giver)**: G(x) I(✓) V(-) E(✓) R(✓)  
  - **Confirms**:
    - Position 2: I (✓, fixed).
    - Position 4: E (✓, fixed).
    - Position 5: R (✓, fixed).
    - V is **present** in the word but **not** at position 3.
  - **New insights**:
    - G is **absent**.
    - V must occupy position 1 (only untested position left that can logically hold V) because positions 2, 4, and 5 are fixed, and V cannot be at position 3 (via feedback).
    - Position 3 must be filled by a letter not yet excluded and not V (since V is at position 1). Available letters: B, H, J, K, N, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Z (avoiding absent letters S, L, A, T, M, D, C, F, Y, G).

### Deduced Secret Word Pattern
- Known: **V (pos1), I (pos2), ? (pos3), E (pos4), R (pos5)**
- **Candidates for position 3**: Prioritize high-frequency letters (e.g., N, P, O). Word must be valid English.
  - Strong candidate: **""VIPER""** (V-I-P-E-R), with P in position 3:
    - P is common and untested.
    - ""VIPER"" matches pattern.
  - Alternatives (if ""VIPER"" fails): VINER (N), VOWER (O/W), but ""VIPER"" is more frequent.

Strategy: Guess **""VIPER""** to test position 3 with P. If incorrect, position 3 can be refined with the final guess.",Guess 5: viper -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) I(✓) P(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
