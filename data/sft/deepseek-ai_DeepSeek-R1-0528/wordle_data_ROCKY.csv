We just received feedback on our first guess ""SLATE"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of S, L, A, T, E are in the secret word.

 Since none of these letters appear in the secret word, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 The secret word is a 5-letter word that does not contain S, L, A, T, or E.

 We have 6 tries and we are on the second try.

 Now, we need to choose a new word that doesn't have S, L, A, T, or E.

 Common letters: Let's consider other common letters in English 5-letter words: 
   Vowels: O, I, U (Y may also be a vowel, but often used as a consonant too)
   Consonants: R, N, B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since E and A (the most common vowels) are ruled out, we should try other vowels: O, I, U.

 Also, consonants: R, N, H, D, C, etc.

 A good approach is to pick a word that uses common remaining letters and covers new letters.

 Example common starting words without the banned letters: 
   Consider words like ""ORCIN"", but that might not be common. We need a valid English word.

 Let's think of words that include O, I, U, and common consonants.

 One classic second guess after eliminating E and A might be ""OUIJA"", but that has a 'J' which is less common. Also, it has two 'I's? And it might contain a letter we haven't tested.

 But note: we have eliminated S,L,A,T,E. So we can use:

   Vowels to try: O, I, U
   Consonants: R, N, B, C, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

 Another idea: ""ROUND"" – but it has R, O, U, N, D. However, U is a vowel we haven't tried and R, N, D are common.

 But wait: we might want to maximize the number of new letters. Also, we can avoid using duplicate letters.

 Since we have no information, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me try to form a word that uses common letters excluding S,L,A,T,E.

 List of frequent letters excluding those: 
   O, I, R, N, H, D, C, U, M, P, etc.

 I propose ""CROWN"":
   C, R, O, W, N. 
   This covers:
      C: common consonant
      R: very common consonant
      O: vowel
      W: less common but we are testing
      N: common consonant

 Also, ""PRION"", but that may be obscure.

 Another one: ""POUND"", which has P, O, U, N, D.

 But note: we only have 5 positions, so we have to pick one.

 However, we are only on the second guess and we have no correct letters. We want to test vowels and consonants.

 After eliminating E and A, the most frequent remaining vowels are O and I.

 So a word that includes O and I: 
   Examples: ""POINT"", ""MOUNT"", ""JOINT"", ... but wait T is banned? Yes, T was in the first guess and was an ""x"", so we must avoid T.

 Avoid T: so ""POINT"" has T -> invalid because we know T is not in the word.

 Similarly, avoid T: so ""MOUNT"" has T -> invalid.

 Let's try words without T and without the banned letters S,L,A,T,E.

 Words containing O and I: 
   ""CHOIR"" - but has H and C? and R? and avoids banned letters? 
        C, H, O, I, R -> none of these are S,L,A,T,E -> valid.

   Is ""CHOIR"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

   Alternatively, ""VOICE"" - but E is banned. Avoid E.

   ""NOISY"": has S? S is banned? S was in the first guess and was ""x"", so S is banned? Wait: S was marked 'x' meaning not in word.

   So we cannot use S. Similarly, ""NOISY"" has S -> invalid.

   ""WOULD"": has O, U, L? But L is banned? Yes, L was in the first guess and got 'x', so we avoid L.

   Therefore, ""CHOIR"" seems a good candidate: uses C, H, O, I, R. All new letters.

 Another candidate: ""PIOUS"" -> but S is banned -> invalid.

 ""QUOIN"" -> Q, U, O, I, N -> no banned letters? Q is not banned? We haven't banned Q. And U,O,I,N are acceptable.

 But ""QUOIN"" is a word meaning an exterior angle of a wall? It's valid but might be obscure.

 We should choose a common word to avoid invalid guesses.

 Let me think of words that are common and have vowels O and I and avoid the banned letters.

 ""GOING"": has G, N, O, I -> avoids banned letters? G, O, I, N: no S,L,A,T,E. But it has 4 letters? No, GOING is 5 letters? G-O-I-N-G? 5 letters.

 But GOING has a repeated letter? No: G appears twice? So we have two Gs? That might not be efficient because if one G is correct then we know the other is redundant, but if not we haven't learned about another letter. Better to have distinct letters.

 So ""CHOIR"" has 5 distinct letters: C, H, O, I, R.

 Another word: ""BRING"" - has B, R, I, N, G -> distinct and avoids banned letters? B, R, I, N, G: none of S,L,A,T,E.

 But ""BRING"" does not include O? We want to test another vowel.

 Alternatively, ""GROIN"": G, R, O, I, N -> distinct and avoids banned letters.

 Or ""CROWN"": C, R, O, W, N -> distinct, avoids banned.

 Given that we know nothing, testing two vowels (O and I) might be more efficient.

 Therefore, let's go with ""CHOIR"" or ""GROIN"". 

 I'll choose ""GROIN"" because it uses common consonants and two vowels (O and I). We'll use:

   Guess: GROIN

 But note: we also want to maximize commonality. GROIN might be slightly less common, but valid.

 Another candidate: ""ORCIN"" - rare. 

 Or ""PRION""? It's a scientific term, but acceptable.

 Let me look for more common words: ""POINT"" is common but has T -> banned.

 How about ""MOURN"": M, O, U, R, N -> has O and U (two vowels) and avoids banned letters? Yes.

 But M is less common than G? 

 Actually, we don't have frequency for exactly this situation. 

 I think ""CHOIR"" is a good choice. 

 Let me confirm the letters: C, H, O, I, R -> none in {S,L,A,T,E}. 

 So we'll guess ""CHOIR"".

 But wait, the second position in ""CHOIR"" is H? We haven't tested H before. Similarly for C, R.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses more common consonants. R is very common, so is N. 

 What about ""CRONy""? But Y? And ""CRONY"" is 5 letters? C-R-O-N-Y -> but Y is acceptable. 

 However, CRONY has a Y which sometimes acts as vowel. But avoid if not necessary.

 We'll go with ""CHOIR"".

 Decision: next guess is ""CHOIR"".

After analyzing the feedback from the first ""SLATE"":
- All letters (S, L, A, T, E) are **absent** (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.
- The new guess must avoid these 5 letters entirely.

Strategy for Guess 2:
- Test **high-frequency replacement letters**:
  - Vowels: Prioritize O, I, U (since E and A are eliminated).
  - Consonants: Focus on common ones like R, N, C, H, D, M.
- Aim for **maximum coverage** of new letters.
- Selected ""CHOIR"" because:

  - High-information potential: Tests common patterns (I/O vowels) without repeats.

 Since E and A (the most common vowels) are ruled out, we should try other vowels: O, I, U.

 Also, consonants: R, N, H, D, C, etc.

 A good approach is to pick a word that uses common remaining letters and covers new letters.

 Example common starting words without the banned letters: 
   Consider words like ""ORCIN"", but that might not be common. We need a valid English word.

 Let's think of words that include O, I, U, and common consonants.

 One classic second guess after eliminating E and A might be ""OUIJA"", but that has a 'J' which is less common. Also, it has two 'I's? And it might contain a letter we haven't tested.

 But note: we have eliminated S,L,A,T,E. So we can use:

   Vowels to try: O, I, U
   Consonants: R, N, B, C, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

 Another idea: ""ROUND"" – but it has R, O, U, N, D. However, U is a vowel we haven't tried and R, N, D are common.

 But wait: we might want to maximize the number of new letters. Also, we can avoid using duplicate letters.

 Since we have no information, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me try to form a word that uses common letters excluding S,L,A,T,E.

 List of frequent letters excluding those: 
   O, I, R, N, H, D, C, U, M, P, etc.

 I propose ""CROWN"":
   C, R, O, W, N. 
   This covers:
      C: common consonant
      R: very common consonant
      O: vowel
      W: less common but we are testing
      N: common consonant

 Also, ""PRION"", but that may be obscure.

 Another one: ""POUND"", which has P, O, U, N, D.

 But note: we only have 5 positions, so we have to pick one.

 However, we are only on the second guess and we have no correct letters. We want to test vowels and consonants.

 After eliminating E and A, the most frequent remaining vowels are O and I.

 So a word that includes O and I: 
   Examples: ""POINT"", ""MOUNT"", ""JOINT"", ... but wait T is banned? Yes, T was in the first guess and was an ""x"", so we must avoid T.

 Avoid T: so ""POINT"" has T -> invalid because we know T is not in the word.

 Similarly, avoid T: so ""MOUNT"" has T -> invalid.

 Let's try words without T and without the banned letters S,L,A,T,E.

 Words containing O and I: 
   ""CHOIR"" - but has H and C? and R? and avoids banned letters? 
        C, H, O, I, R -> none of these are S,L,A,T,E -> valid.

   Is ""CHOIR"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

   Alternatively, ""VOICE"" - but E is banned. Avoid E.

   ""NOISY"": has S? S is banned? S was in the first guess and was ""x"", so S is banned? Wait: S was marked 'x' meaning not in word.

   So we cannot use S. Similarly, ""NOISY"" has S -> invalid.

   ""WOULD"": has O, U, L? But L is banned? Yes, L was in the first guess and got 'x', so we avoid L.

   Therefore, ""CHOIR"" seems a good candidate: uses C, H, O, I, R. All new letters.

 Another candidate: ""PIOUS"" -> but S is banned -> invalid.

 ""QUOIN"" -> Q, U, O, I, N -> no banned letters? Q is not banned? We haven't banned Q. And U,O,I,N are acceptable.

 But ""QUOIN"" is a word meaning an exterior angle of a wall? It's valid but might be obscure.

 We should choose a common word to avoid invalid guesses.

 Let me think of words that are common and have vowels O and I and avoid the banned letters.

 ""GOING"": has G, N, O, I -> avoids banned letters? G, O, I, N: no S,L,A,T,E. But it has 4 letters? No, GOING is 5 letters? G-O-I-N-G? 5 letters.

 But GOING has a repeated letter? No: G appears twice? So we have two Gs? That might not be efficient because if one G is correct then we know the other is redundant, but if not we haven't learned about another letter. Better to have distinct letters.

 So ""CHOIR"" has 5 distinct letters: C, H, O, I, R.

 Another word: ""BRING"" - has B, R, I, N, G -> distinct and avoids banned letters? B, R, I, N, G: none of S,L,A,T,E.

 But ""BRING"" does not include O? We want to test another vowel.

 Alternatively, ""GROIN"": G, R, O, I, N -> distinct and avoids banned letters.

 Or ""CROWN"": C, R, O, W, N -> distinct, avoids banned.

 Given that we know nothing, testing two vowels (O and I) might be more efficient.

 Therefore, let's go with ""CHOIR"" or ""GROIN"". 

 I'll choose ""GROIN"" because it uses common consonants and two vowels (O and I). We'll use:

   Guess: GROIN

 But note: we also want to maximize commonality. GROIN might be slightly less common, but valid.

 Another candidate: ""ORCIN"" - rare. 

 Or ""PRION""? It's a scientific term, but acceptable.

 Let me look for more common words: ""POINT"" is common but has T -> banned.

 How about ""MOURN"": M, O, U, R, N -> has O and U (two vowels) and avoids banned letters? Yes.

 But M is less common than G? 

 Actually, we don't have frequency for exactly this situation. 

 I think ""CHOIR"" is a good choice. 

 Let me confirm the letters: C, H, O, I, R -> none in {S,L,A,T,E}. 

 So we'll guess ""CHOIR"".

 But wait, the second position in ""CHOIR"" is H? We haven't tested H before. Similarly for C, R.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses more common consonants. R is very common, so is N. 

 What about ""CRONy""? But Y? And ""CRONY"" is 5 letters? C-R-O-N-Y -> but Y is acceptable. 

 However, CRONY has a Y which sometimes acts as vowel. But avoid if not necessary.

 We'll go with ""CHOIR"".

 Decision: next guess is ""CHOIR"".After analyzing the feedback from the first ""SLATE"":
- All letters (S, L, A, T, E) are **absent** (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.
- The new guess must avoid these 5 letters entirely.

Strategy for Guess 2:
- Test **high-frequency replacement letters**:
  - Vowels: Prioritize O, I, U (since E and A are eliminated).
  - Consonants: Focus on common ones like R, N, C, H, D, M.
- Aim for **maximum coverage** of new letters.
- Selected ""CHOIR"" because:
  - Uses 5 fresh letters (C, H, O, I, R), avoiding S/L/A/T/E.
  - Covers 2 vowels (O, I) and 3 consonants (C, H, R).
  - High-information potential: Tests common patterns (I/O vowels) without repeats.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. SLATE -> all x: So the secret word contains none of S, L, A, T, E.
2. CHOIR -> Feedback: C(-) H(x) O(-) I(x) R(-)

Interpretation of feedback for CHOIR:
- C is in the word but not in the first position (since it's marked with - for position 1). Remember, CHOIR is positions: C(1), H(2), O(3), I(4), R(5)
- H is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but not in the third position (because it's marked - for position 3)
- I is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked - for position 5)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains C, O, and R (but not C in position 1, O in position 3, or R in position 5).
- It does not contain H or I (and also not S,L,A,T,E from before).

So banned letters: S, L, A, T, E, H, I.

We must avoid: S, L, A, T, E, H, I.

Included letters: C, O, R (each at least once, and not in the forbidden positions).

We don't know the positions for C, O, R yet. They must be in other positions.

Possible positions:
- C cannot be in position 1.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- R cannot be in position 5.

We also know the secret word is 5 letters long and we have 4 attempts left.

We need to include C, O, R and two new letters (since we have banned 7 letters and we have to avoid those).

We must choose a word that includes C, O, R (each at least once), avoids S,L,A,T,E,H,I, and has two new letters.

Let me list the known letters to include: C, O, R.

But note: the word must contain these, but we don't know how many times. However, since we only got one - for each, it's likely they appear once, but they might appear multiple times? But the feedback would show duplicates appropriately? Wait, let's check: if a letter appears twice and one is correct and one is wrong, it would show accordingly. But in CHOIR, we only have one of each, so unless the secret has duplicates, we know each appears at least once.

We don't have information about duplicates, but since the feedback only showed one - per letter, we assume no duplicates for now.

So we need a word with C, O, R and two other letters, avoiding S,L,A,T,E,H,I.

Moreover, C cannot be in pos1, O cannot be in pos3, R cannot be in pos5.

We also want to test new letters to gather more information.

We have many letters left: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should choose two common letters to add.

Let me try to form words with C, O, R.

Common patterns: words like ""CROWD"", but W and D? And C is in pos1? But C cannot be in pos1. So ""CROWD"" has C in pos1 -> invalid.

""OCEAN"" but E and A banned -> invalid.

We need to avoid banned letters.

Let's think of words that have C, O, R but not necessarily in that order.

Example: ""ROCK"" -> too short? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words: How about ""CORDY"" ? Not common.

Or ""CURD"" -> too short.

Let's make a list:

With C, O, R: possible words: 
""FORC"" -> no, 4 letters.

5-letter words: 
Examples: 
- CROUP? But U and P are allowed? CROUP: letters C,R,O,U,P. But O is in position 3? Wait: C R O U P -> positions: C1, R2, O3, U4, P5. But O cannot be in position 3? Because in CHOIR, O was in pos3 and got -, meaning if O is in the word, it cannot be in pos3. So O in pos3 is forbidden.

Similarly, R cannot be in pos5: CROUP has R in pos2? which is allowed? Yes, but O is in pos3 -> forbidden.

Therefore CROUP invalid because O is in pos3.

Another word: ""CORNY"" -> letters: C,O,R,N,Y. Positions: C1, O2, R3, N4, Y5.

But C cannot be in pos1 -> forbidden. So invalid.

How about ""ROUGE""? But E is banned -> invalid.

""PROUD"" -> P,R,O,U,D. Positions: P1,R2,O3,U4,D5. 
But O in pos3 -> forbidden? Yes, O cannot be in pos3. So invalid.

What about ""GROUP""? G,R,O,U,P. Positions: G1,R2,O3,U4,P5 -> O in pos3? Forbidden -> invalid.

So we need a word where:
- C is not in pos1,
- O is not in pos3,
- R is not in pos5.

Let me try to place C, O, R in allowable positions.

Possible positions:
C: can be in 2,3,4,5 (but not 1)
O: can be in 1,2,4,5 (but not 3)
R: can be in 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

Now, we also need two additional letters.

Let me try to think of common words:

Start with the first position? Since C cannot be first, the first letter must be one of the new letters or O or R.

If we put O first: allowed since O can be in position 1.

Similarly, R first is allowed.

C cannot be first.

If O is first, then word starts with O. Examples: ""OCEAN"" invalid, ""OTHER"" has H banned? H is banned -> invalid.

Let's avoid all banned letters.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,J,K,M,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and some vowels: O,U (since E,A,I banned, U is available).

Possible words:

Option 1: Start with O? 
Then positions: O1, then what?
But we need C and R elsewhere.
Example: ""OUNCE"" -> has E? banned -> invalid.

""OUTDO"" -> has U,T? T banned -> invalid.

Try starting with R:
R1, then positions 2-5: cannot have O in 3? Actually, O can be in other positions.

Examples: ""ROWDY"" -> R1,O2,W3,D4,Y5. 
Now check forbidden positions:
C: not present? But we need C in the word. So must have C somewhere.

We must include C, O, R. All three.

""ROWDY"" has R and O, but no C. So invalid.

Another: ""ROUGH"" has G and H? But H is banned -> invalid.

""ROBOT"" has B, O, T? T banned -> invalid.

""ROACH"" has A and H? Both banned -> invalid.

""ROCKY"" has K and Y, but C? And positions: R1,O2,C3,K4,Y5 -> C is in pos3? That's allowed? Yes, since C only forbidden in pos1. O is in pos2 -> allowed. R in pos1 -> allowed? Yes, R can be in pos1 because R is only forbidden in pos5.

Now, is O in pos3? No, in this word O is in pos2 -> okay.

We must avoid banned letters: R,O,C,K,Y. 
Are any banned? S,L,A,T,E,H,I banned -> K,Y are allowed? Yes.

But does it include C? Yes: R,O,C,K,Y -> letters: C is present? R,O,C,K,Y. Yes.

""C"" is in position 3: that's not forbidden? Forbidden for C was only pos1? Correct.

Moreover, O in pos2? Not forbidden? Forbidden was pos3 only.

R in pos1? Not forbidden? Forbidden for R was pos5 only.

And the word ""ROCKY"" is a valid English word? Yes, meaning unsteady.

Now, but we have the ban on H and I? No problem here? H and I not present.

So ""ROCKY"" could be a candidate? But let me check the banned letters: S,L,A,T,E,H,I -> none in ROCKY -> valid.

However, we are also supposed to test new letters? We need to cover more, but we have K and Y which are new.

But wait: in ""ROCKY"", we have O and C? Yes, but we already know O and C are in the word? Only O and C? Actually we know C, O, and R are in the word.

In ROCKY, we have R, O, C, K, Y -> includes C, O, R? Yes, plus K and Y.

Positions:
- R is in position 1: allowed.
- O in position 2: allowed.
- C in position 3: allowed? Yes, no restriction on C for pos3.
- K in position 4: new letter.
- Y in position 5: new letter.

But note: R cannot be in pos5? Here R is in pos1, so no issue.

Additionally, we haven't tested positions: K and Y are new.

But is O appearing again? No duplicates? Probably one of each.

One concern: in CHOIR, O was tested in pos3 and got -, meaning that in ROCKY, if O is in pos2, that might be correct? Or maybe not.

Similarly, R in pos1 vs in CHOIR R was in pos5 and got - meaning R is in the word but not in pos5? Here it's in pos1, which is fine.

But we don't know.

However, we need to guess a word that satisfies the constraints.

Another word: ""CORVY"" - not common.

Or ""CONKY""? Not common.

But ROCKY is common.

Another possibility: since we must avoid O in pos3, maybe put O elsewhere.

Another word: ""DORIC"" -> letters D,O,R,I,C -> but I is banned? I is banned -> invalid.

""BORIC"" -> B,O,R,I,C -> I banned -> invalid.

What about ""FORCE""? F,O,R,C,E -> E banned -> invalid.

So without E.

Let me try ""YOCRY""? Not a word.

How about ""CROUPY""? 6 letters.

Back to ""ROCKY"" – seems acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word with U or other vowels? We have U available.

Another word: ""COURD""? Not common.

Perhaps ""MOROC"" – not a word.

So ROCKY might be okay.

But we have R in pos1? And we know R is in the word? But we don't require R to be in pos1? Only that it's not in pos5.

Now, we have C in the word. In ROCKY, C is in pos3.

But in CHOIR, C was in pos1 and got -, meaning the correct position is not 1? So if C is in pos3 in ROCKY, that might be the correct position? We don't know.

We are just making a guess to get more information.

Another candidate: let's try ""PORCH"" -> but H banned -> invalid.

""WORMY"" -> W,O,R,M,Y -> but missing C? Must include C -> invalid.

We must include C.

So ""CRONY""? C,R,O,N,Y -> positions: C1, R2, O3, N4, Y5.

But C is in pos1 -> forbidden? Yes, we know C cannot be in pos1? Because from CHOIR feedback C(-) at pos1? So we cannot put C in pos1.

Therefore ""CRONY"" is invalid.

Another: ""CONDO"" -> has O twice? Not efficient and has D,O? But positions: C1,O2,N3,D4,O5 -> again C in pos1 -> forbidden.

Invalid.

How about ""DOCKS"" -> S banned -> invalid.

""LOCKS"" -> L banned -> invalid.

So after considering, ""ROCKY"" seems to satisfy:
- Letters: R,O,C,K,Y -> all not banned? 
  R: allowed, O: allowed, C: allowed, K: allowed, Y: allowed.
- Positions: 
  R1: allowed (R only forbidden in pos5)
  O2: allowed (O forbidden only in pos3)
  C3: allowed (C forbidden in pos1)
  K4: new
  Y5: new

And it includes C, O, R.

Moreover, it uses two new letters: K and Y.

So we'll guess ""ROCKY"".

We can consider other words like ""CROOK"" but has two O's? And C in pos1? Forbidden -> invalid.

Or ""WORRY"" -> missing C -> invalid.

Therefore, I choose ""ROCKY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from both previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: SLATE → all (x)**: The secret word contains none of S, L, A, T, or E. These letters are eliminated.
- **Guess 2: CHOIR → C(-) H(x) O(-) I(x) R(-)**:
  - C, O, and R are in the secret word but not in positions 1, 3, or 5 respectively.
  - H and I are not in the word (eliminated).

**Eliminated letters (must avoid)**: S, L, A, T, E, H, I.  
**Confirmed letters (must include)**: C, O, R.  
**Position restrictions**:  
- C cannot be in position 1.  
- O cannot be in position 3.  
- R cannot be in position 5.  

For the new guess:
- Must include C, O, R at allowed positions.
- Must avoid eliminated letters.
- Introduce new letters to maximize information (e.g., testing common consonants like K or Y).
- After evaluation, **""ROCKY""** fits all constraints:
  - Positions: R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5) → satisfies restrictions (C not in 1, O not in 3, R not in 5).
  - Uses new letters K and Y for broader testing.
  - Avoids all eliminated letters (S,L,A,T,E,H,I not present).

This guess aims to verify positions for C, O, R while testing new letter combinations.

<guess>ROCKY</guess>",ROCKY,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. SLATE -> all x: So the secret word contains none of S, L, A, T, E.
2. CHOIR -> Feedback: C(-) H(x) O(-) I(x) R(-)

Interpretation of feedback for CHOIR:
- C is in the word but not in the first position (since it's marked with - for position 1). Remember, CHOIR is positions: C(1), H(2), O(3), I(4), R(5)
- H is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but not in the third position (because it's marked - for position 3)
- I is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked - for position 5)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains C, O, and R (but not C in position 1, O in position 3, or R in position 5).
- It does not contain H or I (and also not S,L,A,T,E from before).

So banned letters: S, L, A, T, E, H, I.

We must avoid: S, L, A, T, E, H, I.

Included letters: C, O, R (each at least once, and not in the forbidden positions).

We don't know the positions for C, O, R yet. They must be in other positions.

Possible positions:
- C cannot be in position 1.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- R cannot be in position 5.

We also know the secret word is 5 letters long and we have 4 attempts left.

We need to include C, O, R and two new letters (since we have banned 7 letters and we have to avoid those).

We must choose a word that includes C, O, R (each at least once), avoids S,L,A,T,E,H,I, and has two new letters.

Let me list the known letters to include: C, O, R.

But note: the word must contain these, but we don't know how many times. However, since we only got one - for each, it's likely they appear once, but they might appear multiple times? But the feedback would show duplicates appropriately? Wait, let's check: if a letter appears twice and one is correct and one is wrong, it would show accordingly. But in CHOIR, we only have one of each, so unless the secret has duplicates, we know each appears at least once.

We don't have information about duplicates, but since the feedback only showed one - per letter, we assume no duplicates for now.

So we need a word with C, O, R and two other letters, avoiding S,L,A,T,E,H,I.

Moreover, C cannot be in pos1, O cannot be in pos3, R cannot be in pos5.

We also want to test new letters to gather more information.

We have many letters left: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should choose two common letters to add.

Let me try to form words with C, O, R.

Common patterns: words like ""CROWD"", but W and D? And C is in pos1? But C cannot be in pos1. So ""CROWD"" has C in pos1 -> invalid.

""OCEAN"" but E and A banned -> invalid.

We need to avoid banned letters.

Let's think of words that have C, O, R but not necessarily in that order.

Example: ""ROCK"" -> too short? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words: How about ""CORDY"" ? Not common.

Or ""CURD"" -> too short.

Let's make a list:

With C, O, R: possible words: 
""FORC"" -> no, 4 letters.

5-letter words: 
Examples: 
- CROUP? But U and P are allowed? CROUP: letters C,R,O,U,P. But O is in position 3? Wait: C R O U P -> positions: C1, R2, O3, U4, P5. But O cannot be in position 3? Because in CHOIR, O was in pos3 and got -, meaning if O is in the word, it cannot be in pos3. So O in pos3 is forbidden.

Similarly, R cannot be in pos5: CROUP has R in pos2? which is allowed? Yes, but O is in pos3 -> forbidden.

Therefore CROUP invalid because O is in pos3.

Another word: ""CORNY"" -> letters: C,O,R,N,Y. Positions: C1, O2, R3, N4, Y5.

But C cannot be in pos1 -> forbidden. So invalid.

How about ""ROUGE""? But E is banned -> invalid.

""PROUD"" -> P,R,O,U,D. Positions: P1,R2,O3,U4,D5. 
But O in pos3 -> forbidden? Yes, O cannot be in pos3. So invalid.

What about ""GROUP""? G,R,O,U,P. Positions: G1,R2,O3,U4,P5 -> O in pos3? Forbidden -> invalid.

So we need a word where:
- C is not in pos1,
- O is not in pos3,
- R is not in pos5.

Let me try to place C, O, R in allowable positions.

Possible positions:
C: can be in 2,3,4,5 (but not 1)
O: can be in 1,2,4,5 (but not 3)
R: can be in 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

Now, we also need two additional letters.

Let me try to think of common words:

Start with the first position? Since C cannot be first, the first letter must be one of the new letters or O or R.

If we put O first: allowed since O can be in position 1.

Similarly, R first is allowed.

C cannot be first.

If O is first, then word starts with O. Examples: ""OCEAN"" invalid, ""OTHER"" has H banned? H is banned -> invalid.

Let's avoid all banned letters.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,J,K,M,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and some vowels: O,U (since E,A,I banned, U is available).

Possible words:

Option 1: Start with O? 
Then positions: O1, then what?
But we need C and R elsewhere.
Example: ""OUNCE"" -> has E? banned -> invalid.

""OUTDO"" -> has U,T? T banned -> invalid.

Try starting with R:
R1, then positions 2-5: cannot have O in 3? Actually, O can be in other positions.

Examples: ""ROWDY"" -> R1,O2,W3,D4,Y5. 
Now check forbidden positions:
C: not present? But we need C in the word. So must have C somewhere.

We must include C, O, R. All three.

""ROWDY"" has R and O, but no C. So invalid.

Another: ""ROUGH"" has G and H? But H is banned -> invalid.

""ROBOT"" has B, O, T? T banned -> invalid.

""ROACH"" has A and H? Both banned -> invalid.

""ROCKY"" has K and Y, but C? And positions: R1,O2,C3,K4,Y5 -> C is in pos3? That's allowed? Yes, since C only forbidden in pos1. O is in pos2 -> allowed. R in pos1 -> allowed? Yes, R can be in pos1 because R is only forbidden in pos5.

Now, is O in pos3? No, in this word O is in pos2 -> okay.

We must avoid banned letters: R,O,C,K,Y. 
Are any banned? S,L,A,T,E,H,I banned -> K,Y are allowed? Yes.

But does it include C? Yes: R,O,C,K,Y -> letters: C is present? R,O,C,K,Y. Yes.

""C"" is in position 3: that's not forbidden? Forbidden for C was only pos1? Correct.

Moreover, O in pos2? Not forbidden? Forbidden was pos3 only.

R in pos1? Not forbidden? Forbidden for R was pos5 only.

And the word ""ROCKY"" is a valid English word? Yes, meaning unsteady.

Now, but we have the ban on H and I? No problem here? H and I not present.

So ""ROCKY"" could be a candidate? But let me check the banned letters: S,L,A,T,E,H,I -> none in ROCKY -> valid.

However, we are also supposed to test new letters? We need to cover more, but we have K and Y which are new.

But wait: in ""ROCKY"", we have O and C? Yes, but we already know O and C are in the word? Only O and C? Actually we know C, O, and R are in the word.

In ROCKY, we have R, O, C, K, Y -> includes C, O, R? Yes, plus K and Y.

Positions:
- R is in position 1: allowed.
- O in position 2: allowed.
- C in position 3: allowed? Yes, no restriction on C for pos3.
- K in position 4: new letter.
- Y in position 5: new letter.

But note: R cannot be in pos5? Here R is in pos1, so no issue.

Additionally, we haven't tested positions: K and Y are new.

But is O appearing again? No duplicates? Probably one of each.

One concern: in CHOIR, O was tested in pos3 and got -, meaning that in ROCKY, if O is in pos2, that might be correct? Or maybe not.

Similarly, R in pos1 vs in CHOIR R was in pos5 and got - meaning R is in the word but not in pos5? Here it's in pos1, which is fine.

But we don't know.

However, we need to guess a word that satisfies the constraints.

Another word: ""CORVY"" - not common.

Or ""CONKY""? Not common.

But ROCKY is common.

Another possibility: since we must avoid O in pos3, maybe put O elsewhere.

Another word: ""DORIC"" -> letters D,O,R,I,C -> but I is banned? I is banned -> invalid.

""BORIC"" -> B,O,R,I,C -> I banned -> invalid.

What about ""FORCE""? F,O,R,C,E -> E banned -> invalid.

So without E.

Let me try ""YOCRY""? Not a word.

How about ""CROUPY""? 6 letters.

Back to ""ROCKY"" – seems acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word with U or other vowels? We have U available.

Another word: ""COURD""? Not common.

Perhaps ""MOROC"" – not a word.

So ROCKY might be okay.

But we have R in pos1? And we know R is in the word? But we don't require R to be in pos1? Only that it's not in pos5.

Now, we have C in the word. In ROCKY, C is in pos3.

But in CHOIR, C was in pos1 and got -, meaning the correct position is not 1? So if C is in pos3 in ROCKY, that might be the correct position? We don't know.

We are just making a guess to get more information.

Another candidate: let's try ""PORCH"" -> but H banned -> invalid.

""WORMY"" -> W,O,R,M,Y -> but missing C? Must include C -> invalid.

We must include C.

So ""CRONY""? C,R,O,N,Y -> positions: C1, R2, O3, N4, Y5.

But C is in pos1 -> forbidden? Yes, we know C cannot be in pos1? Because from CHOIR feedback C(-) at pos1? So we cannot put C in pos1.

Therefore ""CRONY"" is invalid.

Another: ""CONDO"" -> has O twice? Not efficient and has D,O? But positions: C1,O2,N3,D4,O5 -> again C in pos1 -> forbidden.

Invalid.

How about ""DOCKS"" -> S banned -> invalid.

""LOCKS"" -> L banned -> invalid.

So after considering, ""ROCKY"" seems to satisfy:
- Letters: R,O,C,K,Y -> all not banned? 
  R: allowed, O: allowed, C: allowed, K: allowed, Y: allowed.
- Positions: 
  R1: allowed (R only forbidden in pos5)
  O2: allowed (O forbidden only in pos3)
  C3: allowed (C forbidden in pos1)
  K4: new
  Y5: new

And it includes C, O, R.

Moreover, it uses two new letters: K and Y.

So we'll guess ""ROCKY"".

We can consider other words like ""CROOK"" but has two O's? And C in pos1? Forbidden -> invalid.

Or ""WORRY"" -> missing C -> invalid.

Therefore, I choose ""ROCKY"".Based on the feedback from both previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: SLATE → all (x)**: The secret word contains none of S, L, A, T, or E. These letters are eliminated.
- **Guess 2: CHOIR → C(-) H(x) O(-) I(x) R(-)**:
  - C, O, and R are in the secret word but not in positions 1, 3, or 5 respectively.
  - H and I are not in the word (eliminated).

**Eliminated letters (must avoid)**: S, L, A, T, E, H, I.  
**Confirmed letters (must include)**: C, O, R.  
**Position restrictions**:  
- C cannot be in position 1.  
- O cannot be in position 3.  
- R cannot be in position 5.  

For the new guess:
- Must include C, O, R at allowed positions.
- Must avoid eliminated letters.
- Introduce new letters to maximize information (e.g., testing common consonants like K or Y).
- After evaluation, **""ROCKY""** fits all constraints:
  - Positions: R(1), O(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5) → satisfies restrictions (C not in 1, O not in 3, R not in 5).
  - Uses new letters K and Y for broader testing.
  - Avoids all eliminated letters (S,L,A,T,E,H,I not present).

This guess aims to verify positions for C, O, R while testing new letter combinations.",Guess 3: ROCKY -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(✓) C(✓) K(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
