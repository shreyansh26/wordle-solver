We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback. We need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.

 Common starting words for Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 They aim to cover frequent letters.

 I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it is a common starting word that uses five distinct letters including three common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T).

 So, my first guess: SLATE

 Now, I'll format my response as per the instructions.

As the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes the information I get about the secret word. A good starting word typically includes:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants
- Letters that appear often in 5-letter English words
- Preferably no repeated letters to cover more ground

""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains three vowels (A and E - note: S is sometimes vowel-like but consonants are T and L)
2. It uses common consonants S, L, T (S and T are among the most frequent letters in English)
3. All letters are distinct, allowing me to test 5 unique characters
4. It's a recognized word in the dictionary

After this guess, I'll receive feedback for each position that will help narrow down possibilities for future guesses. For example:
- Correct-position letters (✓) will anchor the solution
- Present-but-wrong-position letters (-) will constrain ordering
- Absent letters (x) will eliminate possibilities

We start with no information. The first guess was ""SLATE"" and all letters were marked as absent (x). 
 This means that none of the letters S, L, A, T, or E are in the secret word.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that does not contain S, L, A, T, or E.

 We have eliminated 5 common letters. Now, we need to pick another 5-letter word that uses different letters.

 Considering the English language, other common vowels are I, O, U. Common consonants include R, N, C, D, M, H, G, B, P, K, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""ROUND"" or ""CRIMP"" to cover other frequent letters.

 However, note that we should avoid the eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E.

 Possible words:
 ""ROUND"": uses R, O, U, N, D. None of these are in the eliminated set? Let's check: R(no), O(no), U(no), N(no), D(no). So that works.
 ""CRIMP"": C, R, I, M, P. All new.

 Another common word is ""OUIJA"" but that has J which is less common and repeats A (but A is already eliminated).

 Since there are no repeat constraints, one strategy is to use a word with high-frequency remaining letters.

 According to English letter frequency, the next most common after S, L, A, T, E are: N, R, I, O, etc.

 Let's try a word that includes N, R, I, O, and another common consonant.

 ""IRONY"": I, R, O, N, Y. But Y can be a vowel. And we haven't used these letters.

 Alternatively, ""PRION"": P, R, I, O, N.

 However, let me choose ""CORNY"": C, O, R, N, Y? But we don't know if C, O, R, N, Y are available.

 But since we have no information, let's use a word that maximizes new letters.

 Another good candidate: ""CRONY""

 But note: both ""CRONY"" and ""CORNY"" are words. However, we might not want to use C and Y because they are less frequent? Actually C is common.

 Alternatively, ""PURITY"": too long, 6 letters? Must be 5 letters.

 We need a 5-letter word without S,L,A,T,E.

 I will pick ""CORNY"" as it uses C, O, R, N, Y.

 But wait: let me think of frequency. R is very common, so is N, O. C is also common.

 Another option: ""MOUND"": M, O, U, N, D. This avoids the eliminated letters.

 However, since vowels are important: after eliminating E and A, we should test O and I, U? ""OUIJA"" is not standard because J is rare.

 Perhaps ""QUICK"": Q, U, I, C, K. Q is rare and we have U and I.

 But maybe not.

 Alternatively, ""PRONG"": P, R, O, N, G.

 I think ""PRONG"" is a good choice: it uses common letters that haven't been tested.

 However, I recall that ""audio"" has A which is eliminated. So no.

 We haven't tested I? That's important.

 Another word: ""CRIMP"" as I thought earlier.

 Let me decide on ""CRIMP"": letters C, R, I, M, P.

 Why ""CRIMP"":
- It uses I, a common vowel we haven't tested.
- R and M are common consonants.
- C and P are also frequent.

 Therefore, I will go with ""CRIMP"" as the next guess.

 If we get feedback on this, we will know about these 5 letters.

 Remember: we cannot use S, L, A, T, E at all.

 So, the next guess is: CRIMP

 We'll see what feedback we get.

 Format: <thought> ... </thought> then <guess>CRIMP</guess>
</think>
<thought>
The previous feedback for ""SLATE"" shows that none of the letters S, L, A, T, or E are in the secret word. This eliminates many common letters. For the next guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that avoids these eliminated letters entirely and introduces new common letters to gather more information.

Prioritize testing high-frequency consonants (like R, N, C, M) and remaining vowels (O, I, U). The word should avoid:
- S, L, A, T, E (confirmed absent)
- Any repeats to maximize coverage.

Suitable word options:
- ""CORNY"" (tests C, O, R, N, Y)
- ""CRIMP"" (tests C, R, I, M, P)
- ""POUND"" (tests P, O, U, N, D)

""CRIMP"" is a strong choice because:
1. It covers high-frequency letters: R (#6), C (#14), M (#15), P (#23), and vowel I (#9) in English word frequency.
2. All letters are distinct and unused so far.
3. It tests ""I"" as a potential vowel replacement after E and A were ruled out.

This guess will help identify which letters are present and their positions, especially since no letters are yet confirmed in the secret word.

A good starting word typically includes:\n- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants\n- Letters that appear often in 5-letter English words\n- Preferably no repeated letters to cover more ground\n\n""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because:\n1. It contains three vowels (A and E - note: S is sometimes vowel-like but consonants are T and L)\n2. It uses common consonants S, L, T (S and T are among the most frequent letters in English)\n3.

Now, we need to pick another 5-letter word that uses different letters.\n\n Considering the English language, other common vowels are I, O, U. Common consonants include R, N, C, D, M, H, G, B, P, K, etc.\n\n A good second guess might be ""ROUND"" or ""CRIMP"" to cover other frequent letters.\n\n However, note that we should avoid the eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E.\n\n Possible words:\n ""ROUND"": uses R, O, U, N, D. None of these are in the eliminated set? Let\'s check: R(no), O(no), U(no), N(no), D(no). So that works.\n ""CRIMP"": C, R, I, M, P. All new.\n\n Another common word is ""OUIJA"" but that has J which is less common and repeats A (but A is already eliminated).\n\n Since there are no repeat constraints, one strategy is to use a word with high-frequency remaining letters.\n\n According to English letter frequency, the next most common after S, L, A, T, E are: N, R, I, O, etc.\n\n Let\'s try a word that includes N, R, I, O, and another common consonant.\n\n ""IRONY"": I, R, O, N, Y.

But we don\'t know if C, O, R, N, Y are available.\n\n But since we have no information, let\'s use a word that maximizes new letters.\n\n Another good candidate: ""CRONY""\n\n But note: both ""CRONY"" and ""CORNY"" are words. However, we might not want to use C and Y because they are less frequent? Actually C is common.\n\n Alternatively, ""PURITY"": too long, 6 letters? Must be 5 letters.\n\n We need a 5-letter word without S,L,A,T,E.\n\n I will pick ""CORNY"" as it uses C, O, R, N, Y.\n\n But wait: let me think of frequency. R is very common, so is N, O. C is also common.\n\n Another option: ""MOUND"": M, O, U, N, D. This avoids the eliminated letters.\n\n However, since vowels are important: after eliminating E and A, we should test O and I, U? ""OUIJA"" is not standard because J is rare.\n\n Perhaps ""QUICK"": Q, U, I, C, K. Q is rare and we have U and I.\n\n But maybe not.\n\n Alternatively, ""PRONG"": P, R, O, N, G.\n\n I think ""PRONG"" is a good choice: it uses common letters that haven\'t been tested.\n\n However, I recall that ""audio"" has A which is eliminated.

That\'s important.\n\n Another word: ""CRIMP"" as I thought earlier.\n\n Let me decide on ""CRIMP"": letters C, R, I, M, P.\n\n Why ""CRIMP"":\n- It uses I, a common vowel we haven\'t tested.\n- R and M are common consonants.\n- C and P are also frequent.\n\n Therefore, I will go with ""CRIMP"" as the next guess.\n\n If we get feedback on this, we will know about these 5 letters.\n\n Remember: we cannot use S, L, A, T, E at all.\n\n So, the next guess is: CRIMP\n\n We\'ll see what feedback we get.\n\n Format: <thought> ... </thought> then <guess>CRIMP</guess><thought>\nThe previous feedback for ""SLATE"" shows that none of the letters S, L, A, T, or E are in the secret word.

The word should avoid:\n- S, L, A, T, E (confirmed absent)\n- Any repeats to maximize coverage.\n\nSuitable word options:\n- ""CORNY"" (tests C, O, R, N, Y)\n- ""CRIMP"" (tests C, R, I, M, P)\n- ""POUND"" (tests P, O, U, N, D)\n\n""CRIMP"" is a strong choice because:\n1. It covers high-frequency letters: R (#6), C (#14), M (#15), P (#23), and vowel I (#9) in English word frequency.\n2. All letters are distinct and unused so far.\n3.

We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: SLATE -> Feedback: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x) 
  This means that none of the letters S, L, A, T, E are in the secret word.

Guess 2: CRIMP -> Feedback: C(✓) R(✓) I(x) M(x) P(x)
  This indicates:
    - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
    - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
    - I, M, P are not in the word at all (x).

So, the secret word has:
  - First letter: C
  - Second letter: R
  - Does not contain: I, M, P, S, L, A, T, E

Also, eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, I, M, P.

Therefore, the secret word starts with ""CR"" and the remaining three letters are from the alphabet excluding the eliminated letters.

We need to consider what letters are still available. Eliminated letters: A, E, I, L, M, P, S, T.

Available letters: All consonants except those eliminated, and vowels O, U, and sometimes Y.

Vowels left: O, U (and Y can be a vowel or consonant).

We know the word has the pattern: C R _ _ _

We need to fill in the last three positions with letters not in the eliminated set.

Common letters that might appear: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since we have three positions, and we need to form a valid English word.

Let's brainstorm words starting with ""CR"" that fit these constraints:
- Must avoid A, E, I, M, P, S, T, L.

Examples:
- CROWD? But D is available. Letters: C, R, O, W, D. Check eliminated: O and W are not eliminated? O is available, W is available, D is available. So CROWD is a candidate.
- CROWN? Similarly: W and N available.
- CROPS? But has S and P? Eliminated.
- CRUMB? Has M? Eliminated.
- CRUSH? Has S? Eliminated.
- CRAFT? Has A and F? A is eliminated.
- CRUST? Has S and T? Eliminated.
- CRUMB? Eliminated M.

We need to avoid eliminated letters.

Possible words:
- CROWD: W and D not eliminated.
- CROWN: W and N not eliminated.
- CROOK: O, O? But O is available. However, double O? Check: C,R,O,O,K. K not eliminated. So CROOK?
- CHORD? H, O, D available? But C,R at start? CHORD starts with C and H? But we have positions: position 1 is C, position 2 is R. So CHORD would have H in position 2? No. Our pattern is C R, so position 1 C, position 2 R. So CHORD doesn't fit because it has C then H.

Therefore, we need words that start specifically with ""CR"" and then three more letters.

Other possibilities:
- CRONY? But N and Y available? However, O and N? C,R,O,N,Y. But note guess 2 had I eliminated, so no I. But previously we eliminated A,E,I,L,T,S,M,P. So CRONY: C,R,O,N,Y? O available, N available, Y available.

But let's confirm CRONY: letters C, R, O, N, Y. None of these are eliminated.

Similarly:
- CROWD: C, R, O, W, D
- CROWN: C, R, O, W, N
- CROUP: C, R, O, U, P? P is eliminated -> so no.
- CROWD and CROWN seem good.

Also: CRUD? Too short. Must be 5 letters.

- BROWN? But starts with B, not C.
- We have C fixed at position 1, R at position 2.

Another: CRONE? C, R, O, N, E -> but E is eliminated? Guess 1 had E as absent. So E cannot be used.

Therefore, CRONE is invalid.

CROOK: C, R, O, O, K. Letters used: O and K are available? O is available, K is available. Also, O is repeated? That's acceptable.

CRUMB -> M eliminated.

We can try to think of more words: CROFT? Has F and T? T is eliminated.

So possible words: CROWD, CROWN, CRONY, CROOK, and maybe others.

Our goal: we need to guess a word that tests new letters to maximize information.

The word must start with ""CR"".

Given that we know C and R are in position 1 and 2, we only need to guess the last three. But they must be from the available set.

We have already eliminated: A,E,I,L,M,P,S,T.

Available vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y.

We don't know if there are any vowels in the word beyond the two positions we have. But we have to have at least one vowel? Not necessarily? For example, CRWTH? But that's Welsh and not common. We must use valid English words.

So, let's list candidate words from common vocabulary:

- CROWD (uses O, W, D)
- CROWN (uses O, W, N)
- CRONY (uses O, N, Y)
- CROOK (uses O, O, K)
- CRUDY? Not common. 
- CHROME? But has H and M and E? M and E eliminated.
- BROWN? But doesn't start with CR? We need CR at positions 1 and 2.

Another: CREEK? But E eliminated and E again? Also eliminated.

CRABS? A and S eliminated.

Given we have no other constraints, we could choose CROWD, which uses W and D, which are less common letters? But no, we need to test.

To maximize information, we should use a word that uses as many new letters as possible, and avoid repeating letters we already know are absent? But we haven't tested O, U, W, D, N, etc.

However, we already know that the word starts with CR, so the next guess should test the last three positions.

We can choose a word that uses three new letters that have not been tested. From the eliminated letters, we tested S,L,A,T,E and C,R,I,M,P. So the letters O, U, B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z are untested.

We have many. We should aim for common letters: O, U, D, N, H, K, W, etc.

Possible words with CR:

- CROWD: tests O, W, D (all untested)
- CROWN: tests O, W, N (N is common)
- CRONY: tests O, N, Y

Either is fine. But note that CROOK repeats O. To avoid repetition, we might prefer distinct letters to get more information? So CROOK has two O's, which is inefficient for testing if we get a wrong-position feedback.

Therefore, CROWD or CROWN are better.

I think I'll choose CROWD because it uses D, which is a common letter.

But also, CROWN uses N, which is very common. Both are good.

Alternatively, what about CRUDE? But E is eliminated -> no.

CRUDB? Not a word.

CRUMP? M and P eliminated.

So, between CROWD and CROWN, I'll pick CROWN.

Why CROWN?
- It uses O (a vowel), W (less common), and N (common consonant).
- We'll get feedback on these.

If I get all correct, great. Otherwise, we'll know about O, W, N.

But in the pattern, position 3: O? Position 4: W? Position 5: N?

So let's go with CROWN.

Alternatively, to cover more ground, we could choose a word that doesn't assume we know the positions? But we do know the first two.

We must start with CR.

So I choose CROWN.

Therefore, next guess: CROWN

In the response format: <thought> ... </thought> then <guess>CROWN</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- The secret word starts with ""CR"" since both C and R were correct and in position (✓).
- Letters I, M, P (from CRIMP) and S, L, A, T, E (from SLATE) are eliminated (x), so none appear in the secret word.
- The secret word pattern is ""CR _ _ _"", where the last three letters must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding A,E,I,L,M,P,S,T) and form a valid English word.

Possible words include **CROWD**, **CROWN**, **CRONY**, or **CROOK**. For the next guess:
- **CROWN** is chosen to test common letters: **O** (vowel), **W**, and **N** (common consonant). 
- Using distinct new letters maximizes information gain for positions 3,4,5 if feedback shows correct/misplaced/absent status.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback. We need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.

 Common starting words for Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 They aim to cover frequent letters.

 I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it is a common starting word that uses five distinct letters including three common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T).

 So, my first guess: SLATE

 Now, I'll format my response as per the instructions.<thought>
As the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes the information I get about the secret word. A good starting word typically includes:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants
- Letters that appear often in 5-letter English words
- Preferably no repeated letters to cover more ground

""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains three vowels (A and E - note: S is sometimes vowel-like but consonants are T and L)
2. It uses common consonants S, L, T (S and T are among the most frequent letters in English)
3. All letters are distinct, allowing me to test 5 unique characters
4. It's a recognized word in the dictionary

After this guess, I'll receive feedback for each position that will help narrow down possibilities for future guesses. For example:
- Correct-position letters (✓) will anchor the solution
- Present-but-wrong-position letters (-) will constrain ordering
- Absent letters (x) will eliminate possibilities
</thought>

<guess>SLATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We start with no information. The first guess was ""SLATE"" and all letters were marked as absent (x). 
 This means that none of the letters S, L, A, T, or E are in the secret word.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that does not contain S, L, A, T, or E.

 We have eliminated 5 common letters. Now, we need to pick another 5-letter word that uses different letters.

 Considering the English language, other common vowels are I, O, U. Common consonants include R, N, C, D, M, H, G, B, P, K, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""ROUND"" or ""CRIMP"" to cover other frequent letters.

 However, note that we should avoid the eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E.

 Possible words:
 ""ROUND"": uses R, O, U, N, D. None of these are in the eliminated set? Let's check: R(no), O(no), U(no), N(no), D(no). So that works.
 ""CRIMP"": C, R, I, M, P. All new.

 Another common word is ""OUIJA"" but that has J which is less common and repeats A (but A is already eliminated).

 Since there are no repeat constraints, one strategy is to use a word with high-frequency remaining letters.

 According to English letter frequency, the next most common after S, L, A, T, E are: N, R, I, O, etc.

 Let's try a word that includes N, R, I, O, and another common consonant.

 ""IRONY"": I, R, O, N, Y. But Y can be a vowel. And we haven't used these letters.

 Alternatively, ""PRION"": P, R, I, O, N.

 However, let me choose ""CORNY"": C, O, R, N, Y? But we don't know if C, O, R, N, Y are available.

 But since we have no information, let's use a word that maximizes new letters.

 Another good candidate: ""CRONY""

 But note: both ""CRONY"" and ""CORNY"" are words. However, we might not want to use C and Y because they are less frequent? Actually C is common.

 Alternatively, ""PURITY"": too long, 6 letters? Must be 5 letters.

 We need a 5-letter word without S,L,A,T,E.

 I will pick ""CORNY"" as it uses C, O, R, N, Y.

 But wait: let me think of frequency. R is very common, so is N, O. C is also common.

 Another option: ""MOUND"": M, O, U, N, D. This avoids the eliminated letters.

 However, since vowels are important: after eliminating E and A, we should test O and I, U? ""OUIJA"" is not standard because J is rare.

 Perhaps ""QUICK"": Q, U, I, C, K. Q is rare and we have U and I.

 But maybe not.

 Alternatively, ""PRONG"": P, R, O, N, G.

 I think ""PRONG"" is a good choice: it uses common letters that haven't been tested.

 However, I recall that ""audio"" has A which is eliminated. So no.

 We haven't tested I? That's important.

 Another word: ""CRIMP"" as I thought earlier.

 Let me decide on ""CRIMP"": letters C, R, I, M, P.

 Why ""CRIMP"":
- It uses I, a common vowel we haven't tested.
- R and M are common consonants.
- C and P are also frequent.

 Therefore, I will go with ""CRIMP"" as the next guess.

 If we get feedback on this, we will know about these 5 letters.

 Remember: we cannot use S, L, A, T, E at all.

 So, the next guess is: CRIMP

 We'll see what feedback we get.

 Format: <thought> ... </thought> then <guess>CRIMP</guess><thought>
The previous feedback for ""SLATE"" shows that none of the letters S, L, A, T, or E are in the secret word. This eliminates many common letters. For the next guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that avoids these eliminated letters entirely and introduces new common letters to gather more information.

Prioritize testing high-frequency consonants (like R, N, C, M) and remaining vowels (O, I, U). The word should avoid:
- S, L, A, T, E (confirmed absent)
- Any repeats to maximize coverage.

Suitable word options:
- ""CORNY"" (tests C, O, R, N, Y)
- ""CRIMP"" (tests C, R, I, M, P)
- ""POUND"" (tests P, O, U, N, D)

""CRIMP"" is a strong choice because:
1. It covers high-frequency letters: R (#6), C (#14), M (#15), P (#23), and vowel I (#9) in English word frequency.
2. All letters are distinct and unused so far.
3. It tests ""I"" as a potential vowel replacement after E and A were ruled out.

This guess will help identify which letters are present and their positions, especially since no letters are yet confirmed in the secret word.

<guess>CRIMP</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRIMP -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) I(x) M(x) P(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: SLATE -> Feedback: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x) 
  This means that none of the letters S, L, A, T, E are in the secret word.

Guess 2: CRIMP -> Feedback: C(✓) R(✓) I(x) M(x) P(x)
  This indicates:
    - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
    - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
    - I, M, P are not in the word at all (x).

So, the secret word has:
  - First letter: C
  - Second letter: R
  - Does not contain: I, M, P, S, L, A, T, E

Also, eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, I, M, P.

Therefore, the secret word starts with ""CR"" and the remaining three letters are from the alphabet excluding the eliminated letters.

We need to consider what letters are still available. Eliminated letters: A, E, I, L, M, P, S, T.

Available letters: All consonants except those eliminated, and vowels O, U, and sometimes Y.

Vowels left: O, U (and Y can be a vowel or consonant).

We know the word has the pattern: C R _ _ _

We need to fill in the last three positions with letters not in the eliminated set.

Common letters that might appear: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since we have three positions, and we need to form a valid English word.

Let's brainstorm words starting with ""CR"" that fit these constraints:
- Must avoid A, E, I, M, P, S, T, L.

Examples:
- CROWD? But D is available. Letters: C, R, O, W, D. Check eliminated: O and W are not eliminated? O is available, W is available, D is available. So CROWD is a candidate.
- CROWN? Similarly: W and N available.
- CROPS? But has S and P? Eliminated.
- CRUMB? Has M? Eliminated.
- CRUSH? Has S? Eliminated.
- CRAFT? Has A and F? A is eliminated.
- CRUST? Has S and T? Eliminated.
- CRUMB? Eliminated M.

We need to avoid eliminated letters.

Possible words:
- CROWD: W and D not eliminated.
- CROWN: W and N not eliminated.
- CROOK: O, O? But O is available. However, double O? Check: C,R,O,O,K. K not eliminated. So CROOK?
- CHORD? H, O, D available? But C,R at start? CHORD starts with C and H? But we have positions: position 1 is C, position 2 is R. So CHORD would have H in position 2? No. Our pattern is C R, so position 1 C, position 2 R. So CHORD doesn't fit because it has C then H.

Therefore, we need words that start specifically with ""CR"" and then three more letters.

Other possibilities:
- CRONY? But N and Y available? However, O and N? C,R,O,N,Y. But note guess 2 had I eliminated, so no I. But previously we eliminated A,E,I,L,T,S,M,P. So CRONY: C,R,O,N,Y? O available, N available, Y available.

But let's confirm CRONY: letters C, R, O, N, Y. None of these are eliminated.

Similarly:
- CROWD: C, R, O, W, D
- CROWN: C, R, O, W, N
- CROUP: C, R, O, U, P? P is eliminated -> so no.
- CROWD and CROWN seem good.

Also: CRUD? Too short. Must be 5 letters.

- BROWN? But starts with B, not C.
- We have C fixed at position 1, R at position 2.

Another: CRONE? C, R, O, N, E -> but E is eliminated? Guess 1 had E as absent. So E cannot be used.

Therefore, CRONE is invalid.

CROOK: C, R, O, O, K. Letters used: O and K are available? O is available, K is available. Also, O is repeated? That's acceptable.

CRUMB -> M eliminated.

We can try to think of more words: CROFT? Has F and T? T is eliminated.

So possible words: CROWD, CROWN, CRONY, CROOK, and maybe others.

Our goal: we need to guess a word that tests new letters to maximize information.

The word must start with ""CR"".

Given that we know C and R are in position 1 and 2, we only need to guess the last three. But they must be from the available set.

We have already eliminated: A,E,I,L,M,P,S,T.

Available vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y.

We don't know if there are any vowels in the word beyond the two positions we have. But we have to have at least one vowel? Not necessarily? For example, CRWTH? But that's Welsh and not common. We must use valid English words.

So, let's list candidate words from common vocabulary:

- CROWD (uses O, W, D)
- CROWN (uses O, W, N)
- CRONY (uses O, N, Y)
- CROOK (uses O, O, K)
- CRUDY? Not common. 
- CHROME? But has H and M and E? M and E eliminated.
- BROWN? But doesn't start with CR? We need CR at positions 1 and 2.

Another: CREEK? But E eliminated and E again? Also eliminated.

CRABS? A and S eliminated.

Given we have no other constraints, we could choose CROWD, which uses W and D, which are less common letters? But no, we need to test.

To maximize information, we should use a word that uses as many new letters as possible, and avoid repeating letters we already know are absent? But we haven't tested O, U, W, D, N, etc.

However, we already know that the word starts with CR, so the next guess should test the last three positions.

We can choose a word that uses three new letters that have not been tested. From the eliminated letters, we tested S,L,A,T,E and C,R,I,M,P. So the letters O, U, B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z are untested.

We have many. We should aim for common letters: O, U, D, N, H, K, W, etc.

Possible words with CR:

- CROWD: tests O, W, D (all untested)
- CROWN: tests O, W, N (N is common)
- CRONY: tests O, N, Y

Either is fine. But note that CROOK repeats O. To avoid repetition, we might prefer distinct letters to get more information? So CROOK has two O's, which is inefficient for testing if we get a wrong-position feedback.

Therefore, CROWD or CROWN are better.

I think I'll choose CROWD because it uses D, which is a common letter.

But also, CROWN uses N, which is very common. Both are good.

Alternatively, what about CRUDE? But E is eliminated -> no.

CRUDB? Not a word.

CRUMP? M and P eliminated.

So, between CROWD and CROWN, I'll pick CROWN.

Why CROWN?
- It uses O (a vowel), W (less common), and N (common consonant).
- We'll get feedback on these.

If I get all correct, great. Otherwise, we'll know about O, W, N.

But in the pattern, position 3: O? Position 4: W? Position 5: N?

So let's go with CROWN.

Alternatively, to cover more ground, we could choose a word that doesn't assume we know the positions? But we do know the first two.

We must start with CR.

So I choose CROWN.

Therefore, next guess: CROWN

In the response format: <thought> ... </thought> then <guess>CROWN</guess>Based on the feedback:
- The secret word starts with ""CR"" since both C and R were correct and in position (✓).
- Letters I, M, P (from CRIMP) and S, L, A, T, E (from SLATE) are eliminated (x), so none appear in the secret word.
- The secret word pattern is ""CR _ _ _"", where the last three letters must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding A,E,I,L,M,P,S,T) and form a valid English word.

Possible words include **CROWD**, **CROWN**, **CRONY**, or **CROOK**. For the next guess:
- **CROWN** is chosen to test common letters: **O** (vowel), **W**, and **N** (common consonant). 
- Using distinct new letters maximizes information gain for positions 3,4,5 if feedback shows correct/misplaced/absent status.

<thought>
Eliminated letters: A, E, I, L, M, P, S, T  
Available letters: B, C (known), D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, R (known), U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Secret word pattern: CR_ _ _  
Goal: Test high-frequency untested letters (O, W, N) in positions 3-5.  
""CROWN"" is valid, avoids eliminated letters, and follows the ""CR"" pattern.

We have the following feedback:
- Guess 1: SLATE → S, L, A, T, E are all absent (x). So none of these letters are in the word.
- Guess 2: CRIMP → C and R are correct and in position (✓), I, M, P are absent (x). So the word starts with ""CR"", and I, M, P are not in the word.
- Guess 3: CROWN → C, R, O are correct and in position (✓), W is absent (x), N is present but in the wrong position (-).

So, the secret word is ""CR"" in positions 1 and 2, and O in position 3. Therefore, the word so far is ""CRO _ _"".

Additionally:
- N is in the word but not in position 5 (since we placed it in position 5 and it's marked as wrong position, so it must be in position 4? Not necessarily, it could be in position 4 or we might have it in the wrong position and it could be elsewhere, but we only have positions 4 and 5 left. The word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

We have:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: O (fixed) → so the word is ""CRO _ _""
- Position 5: We placed N and it was marked as present but wrong position. Since position 5 is the only other position we tried for N, and it's wrong, N must be in position 4. Because the only remaining positions are 4 and 5, and we know it's not in 5, so it must be in 4.

But wait, the feedback for CROWN: 
- C(✓) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) N(-)

So:
- C, R, O are correct in positions 1,2,3.
- W is absent, so W is not in the word.
- N is present but not in position 5. Since the only other position available is position 4, N must be in position 4.

Therefore, the secret word is ""CRON_"" and then the last letter is missing. But we have position 4 and 5? No, if position 3 is O, then positions 4 and 5 are the last two. We have N as present but not in position 5, so it must be in position 4. Then position 5 is the only one left.

But the word would be ""CRON"" plus one more letter? ""CRON"" is 4 letters, so we need 5: positions 1 to 5.

So:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: ? (but we know N is present and must be here because it can't be in 5)
- Position 5: ?

But we have N marked as present but wrong position. Since we placed N in position 5 and it's wrong, and positions 1,2,3 are fixed and correct, then N must be in position 4. Then position 5 is the last unknown.

So the word is ""CRON"" + one letter at the end? But ""CRON"" is positions 1-4? Let's index:
- 1: C
- 2: R
- 3: O
- 4: N? (if N is in position 4)
- 5: ?

But we don't have confirmation that position 4 is N yet. We only know that N is in the word and not in position 5. Since position 3 is O and fixed, and positions 1 and 2 are fixed, the only positions left are 4 and 5. N must be in one of them, but we placed it in 5 and it's wrong, so it must be in 4. Therefore, position 4 must be N.

Then position 5 is the only one missing.

So the word is ""CRONx"" where x is the last letter.

But we also know that W is absent, so the last letter cannot be W.

Moreover, from previous eliminations, we know that the following letters are absent: S, L, A, T, E, I, M, P, W.

Also, we have used C, R, O, N. The last letter must be a letter not eliminated and not used? But we can have repeated letters? The feedback hasn't indicated any repeated letters so far, but it's possible.

In this case, since we have C, R, O, N, and we are adding one more, it might be a new letter or a repeat? But we don't have any repeats yet.

Eliminated letters: A, E, I, L, M, P, S, T, W.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a valid English word that starts with ""CRON"". What words start with ""CRON""?

Common words: CRONY? But we already used Y? No, in guess 3 we used CROWN, which had W and N, but we didn't use Y.

CRONY: C,R,O,N,Y. But in our pattern, if position 4 is N, then CRONY would be C,R,O,N,Y. So position 4 is N and position 5 is Y.

But is Y available? We haven't tested Y, and it's not eliminated.

Another word: CRONE? But E is eliminated, so no.

CRONK? Not common.

CRONY seems to be the most common word.

But let's confirm: we have the word ""CRONY"" meaning a close friend or companion.

In our feedback, for guess 3, we had N marked as present but wrong position. But if the word is CRONY, then N is in position 4, and we placed it in position 5, so it should be marked as present but wrong position, which matches.

Also, in CRONY, the letters are C,R,O,N,Y. We have C,R,O correct in positions 1,2,3. Then position 4 is N, which we didn't have in the right place in guess 3 (we had it in 5), and position 5 is Y.

Moreover, W was absent, which is consistent because CRONY has no W.

So the secret word is likely CRONY.

But we need to make sure there are no other possibilities.

Is there another word that fits ""CRONx"" with x being one of the available letters?

For example:
- CRONK: K is available, but is it a word? It might be slang or not common. In English, ""cronk"" is not standard; ""cronk"" could be a surname or sound, but not a common word. Wordle usually uses common words.
- CRONU? Not a word.
- CRONZ? No.

So CRONY seems the only common word.

But what about words that don't have N in position 4? We deduced that N must be in position 4 because it can't be in 5 and positions 1-3 are fixed. But is that correct?

Let me double-check: the word has positions 1,2,3: C,R,O fixed. Then positions 4 and 5 unknown. We placed N in position 5 and got feedback that N is present but not in position 5. Therefore, N must be in position 4. There is no other position for it. So position 4 must be N.

Therefore, the word is ""CRON"" and then one more letter. The only common word is CRONY.

But we have to consider that the feedback for N was ""-"" meaning present but wrong position. In CROWN, we placed N in position 5, but in the secret word, N is in position 4, so it is present but not in the position we guessed, so that matches.

Also, W is absent, which is good.

Therefore, the secret word should be CRONY.

But we are to make a new guess. Since we have only one likely word, we can guess CRONY.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What if the word has repeated letters? For example, could there be a word like ""CROON""? But CROON has two O's. In our case, position 3 is O, and if there is another O, but we haven't tested that. However, in CROON, the letters are C,R,O,O,N. But we have position 3 as O, and if position 4 is O, then we would have ""CROO"", but we don't know about position 4. But in our feedback for CROWN, we had O in position 3 correct, and we didn't have O elsewhere. But if the word had another O, it might not be indicated because we only placed one O. However, in Wordle, if there is a repeated letter, you have to guess it multiple times to get feedback for each occurrence. Since we only placed one O in position 3, and it was correct, if there is another O, it wouldn't be marked unless we guessed it in that position. But in CROWN, we didn't have a second O, so we wouldn't know.

But in this case, for CROON, if we guess CROWN, we have:
- C correct
- R correct
- O correct (position 3)
- W absent (correct, since CROON has no W)
- N: in CROON, N is in position 5, but we placed N in position 5? In CROON, positions: 1C,2R,3O,4O,5N. So if we guess CROWN: positions 1C,2R,3O,4W,5N. Then for position 4, we have W which is not in the word (since CROON has O and N, no W), so W absent. For position 5, we have N, which is present and in the correct position? But in CROON, position 5 is N, so it should be marked correct (✓), not wrong position (-).

But in the feedback, for guess 3, N was marked as present but wrong position (-), not correct. Therefore, if the word were CROON, and we guessed CROWN, then position 5 N should be correct, but it was marked as wrong position, so it cannot be CROON.

Similarly, any word with N in position 5 would have given us a correct mark for N, but we got a wrong position mark, so N is not in position 5. Therefore, it must be in position 4.

Thus, the word is ""CRONx"" with x being a letter that is not eliminated.

Now, what letters are available? Eliminated: A,E,I,L,M,P,S,T,W.

Also, we have used C,R,O,N. The last letter must be one that is not eliminated and not necessarily new, but since we haven't used it, it must be from the available set.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,Q,U,V,X,Y,Z.

Now, ""CRON"" + letter: what words?

- CRONY: Y is available, and it's a word.
- CRONK: K is available, but is it a word? It might be accepted in some dictionaries, but less common. Meaning: to honk like a goose, or slang for something broken. But Wordle might not have it.
- CRONG? Not a word.
- CRONH? No.
- CRONU? No.

So CRONY is the only common word.

Another possibility: perhaps the word is ""CROFT"" but T is eliminated and F is available, but T is out.

Or ""CROWD"" but W is eliminated now.

So I think CRONY is the answer.

Therefore, for the next guess, we should guess CRONY.

But we are to make a new guess, and if we are confident, we can guess it.

To be thorough, we could consider if there is any other word that fits the pattern without N in position 4? But we established that N must be in position 4.

Unless the word has more than one N? For example, if the word is ""CRONK"" and we have N in position 4 and also in position 5? But that would be ""CRONN"", which is not a word. Or if it has N in position 4 and another letter, but we need to place N somewhere else? But positions 1,2,3 are fixed and not N, so N can only be in 4 or 5. And we know it's not in 5, so it must be in 4.

Therefore, the word is CRONY.

So I will guess CRONY.

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (SLATE)**: All letters (S, L, A, T, E) are absent (x), eliminating these letters.
- **Guess 2 (CRIMP)**: C and R are correct and in position (✓), confirming the word starts with ""CR"". I, M, P are absent (x), eliminating these letters.
- **Guess 3 (CROWN)**: C, R, and O are correct and in position (✓), confirming the first three letters as ""CRO"". W is absent (x), eliminating W. N is present but in the wrong position (-), meaning N is in the word but not in position 5.

### Analysis:
- The secret word pattern is **C R O _ _** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are fixed as C, R, O).
- N is present but not in position 5. Since positions 1–3 are fixed, N must be in position 4 (the only remaining position it can occupy).
- Thus, the word is **C R O N _** (position 5 is unknown).
- Eliminated letters (absent in all guesses): **A, E, I, L, M, P, S, T, W**.
- Available letters for position 5: **B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z**.
- Common English words fitting ""CRON_"" include **CRONY** (Y in position 5) or rare words like **CRONK** (K in position 5). ""CRONY"" is a valid, common word, while ""CRONK"" is less common and may not be in Wordle's word list.

Given this, **CRONY** is the most likely solution. It:
- Fits the pattern ""CRON_"" with Y in position 5.
- Uses Y (an available letter).
- Aligns with feedback: N is correctly placed in position 4 (was misplaced in position 5 in Guess 3).

<thought>
- Secret word pattern: C R O _ _  
- N must be in position 4 (since it's present but not in position 5, and positions 1-3 are fixed).  
- Word is now ""CRON_"" for positions 1-4.  
- Position 5 must be a letter not eliminated (A,E,I,L,M,P,S,T,W are out).  
- ""CRONY"" is the only common English word fitting this pattern (e.g., ""CRONK"" is obscure).  
- Guessing ""CRONY"" tests position 5 with Y and confirms N in position 4.  
- If correct, this solves the puzzle.
