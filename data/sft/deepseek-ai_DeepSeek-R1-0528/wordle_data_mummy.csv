We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, I don't have any prior feedback.
 The goal is to choose a word that can give good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.
 A common strategy is to pick a word that contains common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

 Let me choose a word that has:
 - Multiple common vowels (like A, E) and common consonants (like R, S, T).
 This might help reveal several letters.

 I'll choose: CRATE

 Why?
 - It has the letters C, R, A, T, E. These are common letters.
 - The word includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, T).

 This word might give feedback on:
   Whether any of these letters are in the secret word and if they are in the correct positions.

 Now, I'll put my guess in the required format.

I need to make the first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior information, I'll choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and vowel-consonant balance. A strong starting word should include frequently used letters in English 5-letter words. 

After considering options like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", I select **CRATE** because:
- It contains 2 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, T)
- C, R, A, T, and E all appear frequently in English words
- If any letters match or appear, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities significantly

This choice sets a solid foundation for subsequent guesses based on the feedback symbols.

We are given that the first guess ""crate"" resulted in all letters being marked as incorrect (x). 
 This means that none of the letters C, R, A, T, E are in the secret word.

 Therefore, the secret word does not contain these letters: C, R, A, T, E.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not include any of these letters.

 Now, we must consider other common letters. We should avoid letters that we now know are not in the word.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words that are not in the set {C, R, A, T, E} include:
   S, L, N, I, O, U, D, G, H, K, M, P, B, V, Y, W, F, J, Z, etc.

 Since the previous word had no matches, we want to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 A good second guess might be words that include letters like S, L, N, O, I.

 Example: ""SPOIL"", ""LIONS"", ""NOISE"", etc.

 However, note that we must avoid the excluded letters.

 Let's generate a word that uses common letters not yet tried.

 Consider ""S"", ""L"", ""N"", ""O"", ""I"" — these are very common.

 A candidate word: ""SOLID"" — but D might not be as common? Alternatively, ""LINKS"" or ""POUND"".

 We also want to maximize the chance of getting positional information.

 Another idea: ""HOIST"" — but this has H, O, I, S, T. However, T was already excluded? Wait, T was in crate and was excluded. So we cannot use T.

 We must avoid T because the feedback for crate had T as ""x"".

 Therefore, we need a word without C, R, A, T, E.

 Let me propose ""SPOIL"":
   S, P, O, I, L — none of these are in the excluded set.

 Alternatively, ""NOISY"" — N, O, I, S, Y.

 But I think ""SPOIL"" is reasonable.

 However, we have no information yet. Another option: ""SHOWN"" — S, H, O, W, N.

 To cover more common letters, consider ""SLIMY"" or ""PIOUS"".

 I'll go with ""SLIPY"" — but that's not a word? We need a valid word.

 Let me try: ""SPOIL"" is valid.

 Another common second guess in Wordle after excluding a bunch of letters is using the word ""POUND"".

 Since A, E, I, O, U are vowels, but we know A and E are out, so we should include O and I? And maybe U.

 So ""POUND"" — P, O, U, N, D — that avoids the excluded letters.

 However, note that ""crate"" used E and A, so the secret word must use other vowels, likely O, I, U, or sometimes Y.

 We have two options:

 Option 1: ""SPOIL"": S, P, O, I, L
 Option 2: ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D

 Let's compare:

 ""SPOIL"" has S, P, O, I, L — these are all relatively common. S, L, O are very common.
 ""POUND"" has P, O, U, N, D — U is less common? But N is common.

 Alternatively, ""LIONS"" — L, I, O, N, S — that has S, L, O, I, N. That also covers many common letters.

 I think ""LIONS"" might be better because it includes both L, I, O, N, S — which are all common.

 But note: ""LIONS"" is a valid word.

 So I'll choose ""LIONS"": 
   Letters: L, I, O, N, S — all not previously excluded.

 This will test:
   L, I, O, N, S — which are common.

 Then, based on the feedback, we can narrow down.

 Therefore, the guess is ""lions"".

After the first guess ""crate"" revealed that none of the letters C, R, A, T, or E appear in the secret word, my approach for the second guess focuses on:
1. Avoiding all excluded letters (C, R, A, T, E)
2. Testing new common letters to maximize information gain
3. Prioritizing letters like S, L, O, I, N which frequently appear in 5-letter words

I selected **LIONS** because:
- ✓ Contains high-frequency consonants (S, N, L) and vowels (O, I)
- ✓ Tests 5 entirely new letters: L, I, O, N, S
- ✓ Valid English word that may reveal vowel positions and common consonants
- ✘ No overlap with excluded letters from first guess

This choice builds on the elimination strategy—feedback will help identify which of these new letters are present and their positions.

We have two guesses with all letters incorrect:
  Guess 1: crate -> C, R, A, T, E are not in the word.
  Guess 2: lions -> L, I, O, N, S are not in the word.

 So, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S.

 Now, we have to choose a word that uses letters not in the above set.

 The remaining letters in the alphabet are:
   B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We need to form a 5-letter word from these.

 Common letters from the remaining: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

 We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in one guess.

 Let's think of words that use these letters.

 Some possibilities:
   ""DUMPY"" - D, U, M, P, Y
   ""BUGGY"" - B, U, G, G, Y (but G repeated, might not be ideal for information)
   ""HUMPH"" - H, U, M, P, H (repeated H, and not common)
   ""JUMPY"" - J, U, M, P, Y (J is less common)
   ""FUDGY"" - F, U, D, G, Y
   ""PUDGY"" - P, U, D, G, Y

 We want to avoid rare letters if possible. J, Q, X, Z are less common.

 Let's try to find a word that uses B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y without repetition.

 Another idea: ""MUCKY"" - M, U, C, K, Y -> but C is already excluded (from crate) so we cannot use C.

 We must remember the excluded letters: C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S.

 So, we cannot use C.

 Let me try ""DUMPY"": D, U, M, P, Y -> all allowed.

 Is ""DUMPY"" a word? Yes, meaning gloomy or damp.

 Another: ""HUMPH"" is a word but has two H's.

 ""BUGGY"" has two G's.

 ""JUMPY"" is a word: J, U, M, P, Y.

 But J is less common, so maybe avoid.

 ""FUDGY"": F, U, D, G, Y -> valid.

 ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> valid.

 Both ""FUDGY"" and ""PUDGY"" are similar. We can choose one.

 Alternatively, ""MUDDY"" - M, U, D, D, Y -> repeated D.

 ""DUCHY"" - D, U, C, H, Y -> but C is excluded.

 ""DOWDY"" - D, O, W, D, Y -> O is excluded.

 ""GUMPS"" - G, U, M, P, S -> S is excluded.

 So, we need to avoid the excluded letters.

 Let's list possible words:

   DUMPY: D, U, M, P, Y
   FUDGY: F, U, D, G, Y
   PUDGY: P, U, D, G, Y
   JUMPY: J, U, M, P, Y
   BUMPY: B, U, M, P, Y
   HUMPY: H, U, M, P, Y (less common word, but valid as an adjective meaning hump-like)

 We can also consider:
   ""DUMKY"" - not a word.
   ""DUVET"" - D, U, V, E, T -> E and T are excluded.

 Another: ""WIMPY"" - W, I, M, P, Y -> I is excluded.

 ""YUKKY"" - Y, U, K, K, Y -> repeated letters and not very common.

 ""PUKKA"" - P, U, K, K, A -> A is excluded.

 So, let's stick with words like DUMPY, FUDGY, PUDGY, BUMPY.

 We want to maximize the coverage of new letters. 

 In DUMPY: D, U, M, P, Y -> 5 distinct letters.
 In FUDGY: F, U, D, G, Y -> 5 distinct letters.
 In PUDGY: P, U, D, G, Y -> 5 distinct letters? Actually, PUDGY has P, U, D, G, Y -> distinct.

 But note: in FUDGY and PUDGY, we have U, D, G, Y in common, and either F or P.

 We also have BUMPY: B, U, M, P, Y -> distinct.

 Since we have no information, we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

 Among the available letters, common ones in English 5-letter words are:
   B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, Y.

 We don't have H, K, W in the words above? 

 Let me try to find a word that includes H or K or W.

 For example:
   ""WHACK"" - W, H, A, C, K -> A and C excluded.
   ""MUCKY"" - M, U, C, K, Y -> C excluded.
   ""HUMAN"" - H, U, M, A, N -> A and N excluded.

 It's hard to include H, K, W without using excluded letters.

 Another word: ""DOWRY"" - D, O, W, R, Y -> O and R excluded.

 ""HOWDY"" - H, O, W, D, Y -> O excluded.

 ""WACKY"" - W, A, C, K, Y -> A and C excluded.

 So, we might not be able to include W, H, K easily without repetition or using excluded letters.

 Therefore, we can choose one of the words we have.

 Let's choose ""DUMPY"" because it uses M and P, which are common, and Y which is sometimes a vowel.

 Alternatively, ""FUDGY"" uses F and G, which are also common.

 But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We need to get as much information as possible.

 I think ""DUMPY"" is a good choice.

 However, let me check if there's a word that uses more common letters. The most common letters left are: D, M, P, B, F, G, U, Y.

 We can try to form a word with B, D, F, G, M, P, U, Y.

 Since we can only use 5, we have to pick 5.

 Another word: ""GUMPY"" - not a word.

 ""BUDGY"" - not a word.

 ""DUMPY"" seems fine.

 I'll go with ""DUMPY"".

After two guesses with all letters incorrect (CRATE and LIONS), the secret word contains none of these 10 letters: **C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S**.

1. **Avoid all excluded letters** above
2. **Test new high-frequency consonants and vowels** from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
3. **Maximize letter coverage** with 5 distinct letters to gather new information

After evaluating options like FUDGY (F,U,D,G,Y) and BUMPY (B,U,M,P,Y), I selected **DUMPY** because:
- ✓ Uses 5 new common letters: **D, U, M, P, Y**
- ✓ Avoids rare letters (J, Q, X, Z) and repeated characters
- ✓ Tests U (vowel) and frequent consonants (D, M, P)

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, I don't have any prior feedback.
 The goal is to choose a word that can give good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.
 A common strategy is to pick a word that contains common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

 Let me choose a word that has:
 - Multiple common vowels (like A, E) and common consonants (like R, S, T).
 This might help reveal several letters.

 I'll choose: CRATE

 Why?
 - It has the letters C, R, A, T, E. These are common letters.
 - The word includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, T).

 This word might give feedback on:
   Whether any of these letters are in the secret word and if they are in the correct positions.

 Now, I'll put my guess in the required format.I need to make the first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior information, I'll choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and vowel-consonant balance. A strong starting word should include frequently used letters in English 5-letter words. 

After considering options like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", I select **CRATE** because:
- It contains 2 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, T)
- C, R, A, T, and E all appear frequently in English words
- If any letters match or appear, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities significantly

This choice sets a solid foundation for subsequent guesses based on the feedback symbols.

<guess>crate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given that the first guess ""crate"" resulted in all letters being marked as incorrect (x). 
 This means that none of the letters C, R, A, T, E are in the secret word.

 Therefore, the secret word does not contain these letters: C, R, A, T, E.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not include any of these letters.

 Now, we must consider other common letters. We should avoid letters that we now know are not in the word.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words that are not in the set {C, R, A, T, E} include:
   S, L, N, I, O, U, D, G, H, K, M, P, B, V, Y, W, F, J, Z, etc.

 Since the previous word had no matches, we want to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 A good second guess might be words that include letters like S, L, N, O, I.

 Example: ""SPOIL"", ""LIONS"", ""NOISE"", etc.

 However, note that we must avoid the excluded letters.

 Let's generate a word that uses common letters not yet tried.

 Consider ""S"", ""L"", ""N"", ""O"", ""I"" — these are very common.

 A candidate word: ""SOLID"" — but D might not be as common? Alternatively, ""LINKS"" or ""POUND"".

 We also want to maximize the chance of getting positional information.

 Another idea: ""HOIST"" — but this has H, O, I, S, T. However, T was already excluded? Wait, T was in crate and was excluded. So we cannot use T.

 We must avoid T because the feedback for crate had T as ""x"".

 Therefore, we need a word without C, R, A, T, E.

 Let me propose ""SPOIL"":
   S, P, O, I, L — none of these are in the excluded set.

 Alternatively, ""NOISY"" — N, O, I, S, Y.

 But I think ""SPOIL"" is reasonable.

 However, we have no information yet. Another option: ""SHOWN"" — S, H, O, W, N.

 To cover more common letters, consider ""SLIMY"" or ""PIOUS"".

 I'll go with ""SLIPY"" — but that's not a word? We need a valid word.

 Let me try: ""SPOIL"" is valid.

 Another common second guess in Wordle after excluding a bunch of letters is using the word ""POUND"".

 Since A, E, I, O, U are vowels, but we know A and E are out, so we should include O and I? And maybe U.

 So ""POUND"" — P, O, U, N, D — that avoids the excluded letters.

 However, note that ""crate"" used E and A, so the secret word must use other vowels, likely O, I, U, or sometimes Y.

 We have two options:

 Option 1: ""SPOIL"": S, P, O, I, L
 Option 2: ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D

 Let's compare:

 ""SPOIL"" has S, P, O, I, L — these are all relatively common. S, L, O are very common.
 ""POUND"" has P, O, U, N, D — U is less common? But N is common.

 Alternatively, ""LIONS"" — L, I, O, N, S — that has S, L, O, I, N. That also covers many common letters.

 I think ""LIONS"" might be better because it includes both L, I, O, N, S — which are all common.

 But note: ""LIONS"" is a valid word.

 So I'll choose ""LIONS"": 
   Letters: L, I, O, N, S — all not previously excluded.

 This will test:
   L, I, O, N, S — which are common.

 Then, based on the feedback, we can narrow down.

 Therefore, the guess is ""lions"".

<guess>lions</guess>After the first guess ""crate"" revealed that none of the letters C, R, A, T, or E appear in the secret word, my approach for the second guess focuses on:
1. Avoiding all excluded letters (C, R, A, T, E)
2. Testing new common letters to maximize information gain
3. Prioritizing letters like S, L, O, I, N which frequently appear in 5-letter words

I selected **LIONS** because:
- ✓ Contains high-frequency consonants (S, N, L) and vowels (O, I)
- ✓ Tests 5 entirely new letters: L, I, O, N, S
- ✓ Valid English word that may reveal vowel positions and common consonants
- ✘ No overlap with excluded letters from first guess

This choice builds on the elimination strategy—feedback will help identify which of these new letters are present and their positions.

   ""BUGGY"" - B, U, G, G, Y (but G repeated, might not be ideal for information)
   ""HUMPH"" - H, U, M, P, H (repeated H, and not common)
   ""JUMPY"" - J, U, M, P, Y (J is less common)
   ""FUDGY"" - F, U, D, G, Y
   ""PUDGY"" - P, U, D, G, Y

 We want to avoid rare letters if possible. J, Q, X, Z are less common.

 Let's try to find a word that uses B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y without repetition.

 Another idea: ""MUCKY"" - M, U, C, K, Y -> but C is already excluded (from crate) so we cannot use C.

 We must remember the excluded letters: C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S.

 So, we cannot use C.

 Let me try ""DUMPY"": D, U, M, P, Y -> all allowed.

 Is ""DUMPY"" a word? Yes, meaning gloomy or damp.

 Another: ""HUMPH"" is a word but has two H's.

 ""BUGGY"" has two G's.

 ""JUMPY"" is a word: J, U, M, P, Y.

 But J is less common, so maybe avoid.

 ""FUDGY"": F, U, D, G, Y -> valid.

 ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> valid.

 Both ""FUDGY"" and ""PUDGY"" are similar. We can choose one.

 Alternatively, ""MUDDY"" - M, U, D, D, Y -> repeated D.

 ""DUCHY"" - D, U, C, H, Y -> but C is excluded.

 ""DOWDY"" - D, O, W, D, Y -> O is excluded.

 ""GUMPS"" - G, U, M, P, S -> S is excluded.

 So, we need to avoid the excluded letters.

 Let's list possible words:

   DUMPY: D, U, M, P, Y
   FUDGY: F, U, D, G, Y
   PUDGY: P, U, D, G, Y
   JUMPY: J, U, M, P, Y
   BUMPY: B, U, M, P, Y
   HUMPY: H, U, M, P, Y (less common word, but valid as an adjective meaning hump-like)

 We can also consider:
   ""DUMKY"" - not a word.
   ""DUVET"" - D, U, V, E, T -> E and T are excluded.

 Another: ""WIMPY"" - W, I, M, P, Y -> I is excluded.

 ""YUKKY"" - Y, U, K, K, Y -> repeated letters and not very common.

 ""PUKKA"" - P, U, K, K, A -> A is excluded.

 So, let's stick with words like DUMPY, FUDGY, PUDGY, BUMPY.

 We want to maximize the coverage of new letters. 

 In DUMPY: D, U, M, P, Y -> 5 distinct letters.
 In FUDGY: F, U, D, G, Y -> 5 distinct letters.
 In PUDGY: P, U, D, G, Y -> 5 distinct letters? Actually, PUDGY has P, U, D, G, Y -> distinct.

 But note: in FUDGY and PUDGY, we have U, D, G, Y in common, and either F or P.

 We also have BUMPY: B, U, M, P, Y -> distinct.

 Since we have no information, we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

 Among the available letters, common ones in English 5-letter words are:
   B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, Y.

 We don't have H, K, W in the words above? 

 Let me try to find a word that includes H or K or W.

 For example:
   ""WHACK"" - W, H, A, C, K -> A and C excluded.
   ""MUCKY"" - M, U, C, K, Y -> C excluded.
   ""HUMAN"" - H, U, M, A, N -> A and N excluded.

 It's hard to include H, K, W without using excluded letters.

 Another word: ""DOWRY"" - D, O, W, R, Y -> O and R excluded.

 ""HOWDY"" - H, O, W, D, Y -> O excluded.

 ""WACKY"" - W, A, C, K, Y -> A and C excluded.

 So, we might not be able to include W, H, K easily without repetition or using excluded letters.

 Therefore, we can choose one of the words we have.

 Let's choose ""DUMPY"" because it uses M and P, which are common, and Y which is sometimes a vowel.

 Alternatively, ""FUDGY"" uses F and G, which are also common.

 But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We need to get as much information as possible.

 I think ""DUMPY"" is a good choice.

 However, let me check if there's a word that uses more common letters. The most common letters left are: D, M, P, B, F, G, U, Y.

 We can try to form a word with B, D, F, G, M, P, U, Y.

 Since we can only use 5, we have to pick 5.

 Another word: ""GUMPY"" - not a word.

 ""BUDGY"" - not a word.

 ""DUMPY"" seems fine.

 I'll go with ""DUMPY"".

<guess>dumpy</guess>After two guesses with all letters incorrect (CRATE and LIONS), the secret word contains none of these 10 letters: **C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S**. 

For the third guess, I need to:
1. **Avoid all excluded letters** above
2. **Test new high-frequency consonants and vowels** from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
3. **Maximize letter coverage** with 5 distinct letters to gather new information

After evaluating options like FUDGY (F,U,D,G,Y) and BUMPY (B,U,M,P,Y), I selected **DUMPY** because:
- ✓ Uses 5 new common letters: **D, U, M, P, Y**
- ✓ Avoids rare letters (J, Q, X, Z) and repeated characters
- ✓ Tests U (vowel) and frequent consonants (D, M, P)
- ✓ Valid English word (meaning gloomy/dim)

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities by checking a new set of letters.

We should avoid letters that we now know are not in the word.\n\n Common letters in English 5-letter words that are not in the set {C, R, A, T, E} include:\n   S, L, N, I, O, U, D, G, H, K, M, P, B, V, Y, W, F, J, Z, etc.\n\n Since the previous word had no matches, we want to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\n A good second guess might be words that include letters like S, L, N, O, I.\n\n Example: ""SPOIL"", ""LIONS"", ""NOISE"", etc.\n\n However, note that we must avoid the excluded letters.\n\n Let\'s generate a word that uses common letters not yet tried.\n\n Consider ""S"", ""L"", ""N"", ""O"", ""I"" — these are very common.\n\n A candidate word: ""SOLID"" — but D might not be as common? Alternatively, ""LINKS"" or ""POUND"".\n\n We also want to maximize the chance of getting positional information.\n\n Another idea: ""HOIST"" — but this has H, O, I, S, T. However, T was already excluded? Wait, T was in crate and was excluded. So we cannot use T.\n\n We must avoid T because the feedback for crate had T as ""x"".\n\n Therefore, we need a word without C, R, A, T, E.\n\n Let me propose ""SPOIL"":\n   S, P, O, I, L — none of these are in the excluded set.\n\n Alternatively, ""NOISY"" — N, O, I, S, Y.\n\n But I think ""SPOIL"" is reasonable.\n\n However, we have no information yet. Another option: ""SHOWN"" — S, H, O, W, N.\n\n To cover more common letters, consider ""SLIMY"" or ""PIOUS"".\n\n I\'ll go with ""SLIPY"" — but that\'s not a word? We need a valid word.\n\n Let me try: ""SPOIL"" is valid.\n\n Another common second guess in Wordle after excluding a bunch of letters is using the word ""POUND"".\n\n Since A, E, I, O, U are vowels, but we know A and E are out, so we should include O and I? And maybe U.\n\n So ""POUND"" — P, O, U, N, D — that avoids the excluded letters.\n\n However, note that ""crate"" used E and A, so the secret word must use other vowels, likely O, I, U, or sometimes Y.\n\n We have two options:\n\n Option 1: ""SPOIL"": S, P, O, I, L\n Option 2: ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D\n\n Let\'s compare:\n\n ""SPOIL"" has S, P, O, I, L — these are all relatively common. S, L, O are very common.\n ""POUND"" has P, O, U, N, D — U is less common? But N is common.\n\n Alternatively, ""LIONS"" — L, I, O, N, S — that has S, L, O, I, N. That also covers many common letters.\n\n I think ""LIONS"" might be better because it includes both L, I, O, N, S — which are all common.\n\n But note: ""LIONS"" is a valid word.\n\n So I\'ll choose ""LIONS"": \n   Letters: L, I, O, N, S — all not previously excluded.\n\n This will test:\n   L, I, O, N, S — which are common.\n\n Then, based on the feedback, we can narrow down.\n\n Therefore, the guess is ""lions"".\n\n<guess>lions</guess>After the first guess ""crate"" revealed that none of the letters C, R, A, T, or E appear in the secret word, my approach for the second guess focuses on:\n1.

We have feedback from Guess 3: dumpy -> D(x), U(✓), M(✓), P(x), Y(✓)
 This means:
   - U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since U is the second letter in ""dumpy"")
   - M is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since M is the third letter in ""dumpy"")
   - Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since Y is the fifth letter in ""dumpy"")
   - D and P are not in the word.

 Additionally, from previous guesses, we know that the word does not contain:
   C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S, D, P

 So, the excluded letters are: C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S, D, P

 The secret word must have:
   Position 2: U
   Position 3: M
   Position 5: Y

 And we know positions 1 and 4 are letters that are not excluded and not U, M, Y.

 The current pattern is: _ U M _ Y

 We need to fill in the first and fourth positions with letters not in the excluded set and not D or P (which we now know are excluded).

 The total excluded letters so far: C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S,D,P

 The remaining letters (from the alphabet) are: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

 But note that we must choose letters that form a valid English word.

 We also know that the word cannot contain any of the excluded letters, and we have constraints on positions 1 and 4.

 Let's think of words that fit the pattern: ? U M ? Y

 Possible words:
   We need to try combinations for the first and fourth positions from the available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z

 Let me try to brainstorm:
   BUMFY? Not a word.
   FUMBY? Not a word.
   GUMBY? Not a word (unless a proper noun?).
   HUMBY? Not a word.
   JUMBY? JUMBY is a word (a spirit in Caribbean folklore).
   KUMBY? Not a word (like kumbaya? but kumbaya is longer).
   QUM?Y? Q doesn't combine well.

 Another idea: 
   BUMPY? But P is excluded, and also we had P as 'x' in dumpy.
   Something else: 
   ""MUMMY"" -> M is already in position 3? But let's see: M,U,M,M,Y -> however, the pattern requires M at position 3, and U at 2, Y at 5. But the word ""mummy"" has U at position 2? Let's check:
      Position1: M -> but we have position3 fixed as M. So in ""mummy"", the M is at position1 and 3,4. But we know that M is in the word and at position 3. So M at position 1 is allowed? The feedback said M is in the correct position at position 3, but it doesn't say anything about other Ms. However, note that in the guess ""dumpy"", we had M at position 3 and got a correct (✓), so if there were an M at position 1, we wouldn't have known because we didn't test an M at position 1.

 But wait, the feedback for dumpy was for the specific positions: 
   Position 1: D(x) -> so D is not in the word and also D is excluded.
   Position 2: U(✓) -> U is correct and in position.
   Position 3: M(✓) -> M is correct and in position.
   Position 4: P(x) -> P is excluded.
   Position 5: Y(✓) -> Y is correct and in position.

 So, the secret word has U at position 2, M at position 3, Y at position 5, and does not contain D or P.

 Now, considering M: we have M only at position 3? But if the word has another M, like at position 1, it might be possible. However, we haven't tested that.

 But let me list possible words:

 We have the pattern: ? U M ? Y

 The fourth letter cannot be P (excluded) or any of the other excluded ones.

 Let me try to think of valid words:

   * HUMKY? Not a word.
   * JUMBY: J U M B Y -> I think JUMBY is accepted in some dictionaries (as jumbie or jumby).
   * BUMFY? Not a word.
   * FUMFY? Not a word.
   * GUMMY: G U M M Y -> has M at position 4? But we don't know if M is in the word more than once. Also, note that we have excluded P, but not M again. However, GUMMY: 
        G at position 1? Yes, and M at position 4? Then we have M at both position 3 and 4? That might be.

   But in our pattern, position 4 must be filled. Let's check:
        Position1: G
        Position2: U (fixed)
        Position3: M (fixed)
        Position4: M -> this would be a repeated M? And then Y at position5.

   So ""GUMMY"" is a word. And it fits the pattern.

   Another: ""BUMMY"" is not a word.

   Also: ""MUMMY"" would have M at position1 -> but we don't have M at position1 tested? However, the pattern requires position2: U, position3: M, so ""MUMMY"" wouldn't fit because position1 is M and position2 is U? Actually, ""MUMMY"" is M-U-M-M-Y -> so it has U at position2 and M at position3 and Y at position5. So ""MUMMY"" also fits the pattern.

   But note: we have excluded the letter D and P, but not H or G. Also, in ""MUMMY"", the M at position1 might be acceptable? Because we haven't tested position1.

   Other words:
        ""BUMMY"" is not valid.
        ""FUMMY"" is not valid.
        ""HUMMY"" might be considered valid? But not a common word.

   Also: ""JUMMY"" - not a word.

   Let me check: 
        GUMMY and MUMMY are both valid.

   However, note: in GUMMY, the fourth letter is M and fifth is Y. Similarly, MUMMY has M at position1 and M at position4.

   Are there any other words?
        ""VUMBY"" - not a word.
        ""WUMBY"" - not a word.

   So the candidates are:
        GUMMY: G U M M Y
        MUMMY: M U M M Y

   But note: we don't know if there can be more than one M. The feedback only confirmed M at position3, but it might appear elsewhere.

   We must also consider that in the word ""MUMMY"", we have M at position1. But we haven't ruled out M at other positions.

   Another word: ""KUMYS"" but S is excluded, and also it ends with S, not Y? No, KUMYS is not common and ends with S.

   How about ""SUMY""? But we have 5 letters: pattern is 5 letters. ""SUMY"" is 4 letters? No, we need 5.

   So the main possibilities are GUMMY and MUMMY.

   But wait, the feedback from Guess 3: dumpy -> we had M at position3, but if the word has M at position4, it wouldn't have been revealed because we didn't have M in position4. Similarly, for GUMMY, we are putting a G at position1 and M at position4.

   However, note that in our third guess, we didn't test for G or M at other positions? But we tested D at position1 and got x, so position1 cannot be D. Similarly, P at position4 got x.

   Now, we have two possibilities: GUMMY and MUMMY.

   But also, note that we have excluded many letters. For position1, we have tried D (with dumpy) and got x, so position1 cannot be D. Also, from lions and crate, we know position1 is not C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S.

   So for position1, we need a letter from the remaining ones: B,F,G,H,J,K,V,W,X,Y,Z? But Y is already at position5? And we know position1 is Y? Not necessarily, but Y could be in other positions? But note we have Y at position5 marked correct, so Y is fixed there.

   So position1 cannot be Y? Well, we don't know for sure because a word could have multiple Ys? But we don't have information about that.

   However, in the pattern, position5 is Y. So if we put Y at position1, that would be a different Y? But the word may or may not allow multiple Ys.

   But let us consider: 
        For MUMMY: position1 is M -> which is allowed? Because M is in the word (we know M at position3) but having another M is not prohibited. The feedback doesn't say anything against multiple Ms.

   Similarly, for GUMMY: position1 is G, which is not excluded? Because G is not in [C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S,D,P]. So G is available.

   Now, how can we decide? Since we have two possibilities, we might need to choose a word that tests one of these.

   But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since this is the fourth guess, and we have 6 total). We can guess one of them.

   Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses one of the possibilities or a different word that might cover both scenarios.

   However, we can also note:

   - If the word is ""MUMMY"", then position1 must be M. 
   - If the word is ""GUMMY"", then position1 must be G and position4 must be M.

   But are there other words? 

   Let me search: are there any other words that fit ? U M ? Y ?

   We must consider the available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z

   So:
        ? U M [B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z] Y

   We need the whole word to be valid.

   So far, we have:
        M U M M Y -> MUMMY (M at both 1 and 4)
        G U M M Y -> GUMMY (G at 1, M at 4)
        H U M M Y -> HUMMY? Not a word.
        B U M M Y -> BUMMY? Not a word.

   Also, with the fourth letter not M:
        For example: 
           B U M B Y -> BUMBY? Not a word.
           F U M B Y -> FUMBY? Not a word.
           H U M B Y -> HUMBY? Not a word.
           J U M B Y -> JUMBY? We considered JUMBY earlier and it might be acceptable? But note JUMBY is spelled J-U-M-B-Y, so it would work: 
                Position1: J, position2: U, position3: M, position4: B, position5: Y.

           And JUMBY is a word (variant of jumbie).

        Similarly:
           K U M B Y? Not a word.
           V U M B Y? Not a word.

        Another: W U M B Y -> not a word.

        So JUMBY is a candidate.

   Also, what about other letters? For example:
        F U M F Y -> not a word? And F repeated.

   So we have at least three candidates:
      MUMMY, GUMMY, JUMBY

   Now, we need to choose one that will help us disambiguate.

   We have feedback that the word has U, M, Y at positions 2,3,5. And we know the letters D and P are not in the word.

   Now, for the next guess, since we have three possibilities and we must guess one, we might choose the one that tests a letter we haven't tried.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests the first letter more broadly.

   But note: we have only 4 more tries? Actually, we are on the fourth guess. So we can try one of these.

   To maximize information, we might choose a word that includes letters we haven't tried yet.

   Letters we have tried: 
      C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S,D,U,M,P,Y -> and U,M,Y are in the word.

   We haven't tried: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z.

   If we guess MUMMY, note that it only uses M,U,Y and one new letter: M (but we already have M). Actually, no new letters? Because the new M is at position1, but we already know M is in the word? It doesn't test a new letter.

   Similarly, GUMMY tests G and M (already known?) and the M again.

   But JUMBY tests J (which is uncommon) and B, which we haven't tested. But if we guess JUMBY and it's wrong, we have more information?

   Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't assume the fourth letter is M. Because we don't know about position4.

   How about if we don't fix it to M? We could try a word that has a different letter at position4? For example, JUMBY (with B at position4) or perhaps another word.

   The word ""FUM Y"" as in ""FUMAY""? Not a word.

   Another word: ""HUYMY"" - not a word.

   So JUMBY might be our only other candidate.

   Now, let me confirm:

   - MUMMY: accepted word
   - GUMMY: accepted word
   - JUMBY: recognized as a variant of jumbie

   So we have three possibilities.

   Now, to choose one, we might pick the one that tests a letter that appears in other possible words? But there are only three.

   Alternatively, we can pick one that uses common letters? But among B, G, J, which is more common? G is more common, then B, then J.

   But note: the word might be GUMMY, which uses G. Or MUMMY, which uses M (already confirmed). Or JUMBY, which uses J and B.

   Since we don't have information about G or B, we might prefer to test a word that includes G or B.

   We could guess GUMMY? Because if it's GUMMY, we get it right. If not, then feedback might tell us about the first letter.

   Alternatively, we could guess a word that has both G and B? But in the pattern ? U M ? Y, we cannot have both G and B because they must occupy position1 and position4.

   Example: we cannot have G at position1 and B at position4 because then we get ""GUMMY"" replaced by ""GUMBY""? Not a word.

   So we cannot do that.

   Since we are forced to pick one pattern, let's choose GUMMY as our next guess because G is a common letter and might appear in other words? But if we are wrong, we can infer.

   Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not one of these three but tests several possibilities? How? We don't know a word that would.

   Another idea: guess a word that has a different structure? But we must follow the pattern because we know positions 2,3,5 are fixed.

   We cannot change the U, M, Y.

   So we must have U at2, M at3, Y at5.

   Therefore, our guess must be of the form XUMZY, where X and Z are letters from the available set.

   So we have fixed positions.

   We are left to guess positions 1 and 4.

   Given that, we should choose a guess that will address multiple possibilities.

   Unfortunately, since we have very few letters left, we might just have to try one and then deduce.

   Let me assign:

   Position1: can be one of B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z
   Position4: can be one of B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z

   And the word must be valid.

   We found:
      Position4 = M: leads to words with position1 being G, M, H? -> GUMMY, MUMMY, but HUMMY not a word? So only GUMMY and MUMMY.
      Position4 = B: leads to JUMBY (if we accept it) and no other we found.

   Also, position4 = K: we could have ""KUMKY""? No, not a word.

   So the only known words are those three.

   Therefore, we should guess GUMMY? Because it tests G at position1 and M at position4.

   If we guess GUMMY:
        If it is correct: we win.
        If not, feedback will show:
            Position1: G -> if it is x, then we know position1 is not G? Then the word would be MUMMY? But note MUMMY has position1=M. 
            Position4: M -> if it is not in the word? But wait, we already have M at position3. How would M at position4 be marked?

        Let's simulate:

        Case 1: the word is MUMMY.
          Guess: GUMMY -> G (position1): since MUMMY has M at position1, and G is not in MUMMY? So G would be x.
          Position4: M -> but MUMMY has M at position4? But note: the M at position4 is already accounted for? Wait, MUMMY has three Ms: at positions1,3,4. We know about the M at position3 already.

          For feedback: 
            Position1: G vs M -> different, so x (since we don't have a G in MUMMY)
            Position2: U vs U -> ✓
            Position3: M vs M -> ✓
            Position4: M vs M -> ✓? But wait, in MUMMY, there are two Ms besides the one at position3? Actually, the M at position4 is present? So if we have MUMMY, then we have Ms at positions3 and4? So in GUMMY, position4 is M and MUMMY has M at position4? So it's the same. So in feedback, position4 would be ✓? Also, we have an extra M at position1? But in GUMMY we don't have M at position1? 

          Actually, the feedback should be:

            Position1: G? MUMMY has M at position1 -> G is not M and MUMMY doesn't have G? So ✓ should be x.
            Position2: U matches -> ✓
            Position3: M matches -> ✓
            Position4: M matches? Yes -> ✓
            Position5: Y matches -> ✓

          So the feedback would be: G(x), U(✓), M(✓), M(✓), Y(✓)

          But wait: we have used two Ms? The secret word MUMMY has three Ms? How would the feedback handle repeated letters?

          In Wordle, the feedback handles repeated letters carefully: each letter in the guess is matched against the word, giving priority to exact positions, and then any remaining are marked as in word but wrong position? But note: if a letter appears multiple times, it can get multiple matches? Or is it counted as many as in the secret word?

          In standard Wordle, feedback counts each occurrence independently. Since MUMMY has three Ms, and GUMMY has two Ms: 
            Position3: M matched exactly -> uses one occurrence.
            Position4: M matched exactly -> uses another occurrence.
            Then, the M in the secret word at position1 remains? But GUMMY doesn't have an M in position1? So the remaining M is unmatched? But GUMMY has M only at positions3 and4? Not at position1.

          However, in the guess GUMMY, we are not claiming a letter M at position1? The M in GUMMY is only at positions3 and4? So the M at position1 in MUMMY would not be matched? But we don't have to worry about position1 in terms of M? Because we guessed G at position1.

          Therefore, feedback only looks at the position:

            Position1: G (incorrect) -> x
            Position2: U correct -> ✓
            Position3: M correct -> ✓
            Position4: M is correct? Yes, MUMMY has M at position4 -> ✓
            Position5: Y correct -> ✓

          Then, what about the extra M? We don't have a M in GUMMY at position1? So no other M. The secret word has one more M? But we didn't guess it? So it doesn't show up? It would only mark the guessed letters.

          Therefore, feedback: x, ✓, ✓, ✓, ✓

          This wouldn't let us know that the secret word has an M at position1? But we would then know that the first letter must be something else? And that the fourth letter is M. But we would have three ✓ and one x? Then next guess we can try MUMMY?

          Alternatively, if we guess MUMMY and the secret word is GUMMY?

          For MUMMY vs GUMMY:

            Position1: M vs G -> M is not G and GUMMY has M? Where? Position4? But in GUMMY, the M is at position3 and4? So:

              Position1: M (guess) vs G (secret) -> is M in GUMMY? Yes, at positions 3 and 4. But since it's not at position1, it would mark:

                  For position1: M is not in the correct position? But M is in GUMMY? So it would be marked as ""-"" for being in the word but wrong position? 

          Let's follow the rules:

            The secret word GUMMY: positions: G, U, M, M, Y.
            Guess: M U M M Y

            Position1: M -> GUMMY has M? Yes, but not at position1? So it should be ""-"" (wrong position)? 
            Position2: U -> matches -> ✓
            Position3: M -> matches -> ✓
            Position4: M -> matches -> ✓
            Position5: Y -> matches -> ✓

            So feedback: M(-), U(✓), M(✓), M(✓), Y(✓)

          This tells us that M is in the word but wrong position? However, we already fixed M at position3 and4? So we have a contradiction? Because in our pattern, position3 and4 are M? And we get ✓ at 3 and 4? Then where is the extra M? Why position1 gets ""-"" meaning it's present elsewhere? But elsewhere includes position3 and4? That might confuse.

          In fact, the feedback system counts each occurrence: GUMMY has two Ms? We guess three Ms? Only two are correct? How?

          Actually, GUMMY has two Ms: one at position3 and one at position4? So the guess ""MUMMY"" has three Ms: position1,3,4.

          In the guess:
            Position1: M -> GUMMY has M? Yes, but not at position1? So one of the Ms in the secret is assigned to this? Or one of the Ms is assigned to the exact matches?

          Typical Wordle feedback assigns green (correct) first, then yellow for any unmatched letters in the word.

          Steps:

            1. Mark exact matches: position2: U, position3: M, position4: M, position5: Y -> four ✓.
            2. For any non-exact, check if the letter appears: position1: M -> is there an M in the secret that isn't matched? But we already matched both Ms in the secret? So no, position1 should be x? 

          Therefore, the feedback for GUMMY against the guess MUMMY would be:
            Position1: M -> x (because both Ms in GUMMY are already matched at positions3 and4)
            Position2: ✓
            Position3: ✓
            Position4: ✓
            Position5: ✓

          So it would be M(x), U(✓), M(✓), M(✓), Y(✓)

          Similarly, if we guess JUMBY against MUMMY:

            Position1: J -> x (if secret is MUMMY, J is not present)
            Position2: U -> ✓
            Position3: M -> ✓
            Position4: B -> vs M? Is B in the word? If secret is MUMMY, no -> x
            Position5: Y -> ✓
            So feedback: J(x), U(✓), M(✓), B(x), Y(✓) -> x,✓,✓,x,✓

   Given that, we might choose JUMBY? Because it tests two new letters: J and B? And we can get more information.

   But note: if JUMBY is the word, we get everything correct.

   Alternatively, we can choose MUMMY? Because M is already confirmed? But not at position1.

   Actually, we have no information about position1 and position4? So guessing MUMMY may be premature.

   We are allowed to try words that help disambiguate.

   Since we have three words:

     Option1: GUMMY -> has letters G, U, M, M, Y -> and we know U, M, Y for sure? But G is the unknown.
     Option2: MUMMY -> has M, U, M, M, Y -> M at position1 is the unknown? But already we have M.
     Option3: JUMBY -> has J, U, M, B, Y -> J and B are unknowns.

   If we guess JUMBY:

        If the secret is GUMMY: 
          Guess: J U M B Y vs G U M M Y 
          Position1: J vs G -> not match, and J is not in GUMMY -> J(x)
          Position2: U ✓
          Position3: M ✓
          Position4: B vs M -> different, and B not in GUMMY -> B(x)
          Position5: Y ✓
          And note: the M we have at position3 matches, but GUMMY has another M at position4? We don't have a B? So feedback: J(x) U(✓) M(✓) B(x) Y(✓)

        This doesn't reveal the M at position4? We would know that position4 is not B.

        But we would know that the secret has no J, no B? So then we might go to GUMMY in the next guess? But we didn't get information about the fourth letter?

        Alternatively, if the secret is GUMMY, we would have no knowledge that the fourth letter is M? Because in our guess we used B at position4? So we didn't test M at position4.

        Then next guess we might try GUMMY and win? Or try to test M?

   Given these, I think it's better to guess GUMMY because it tests a common letter G at position1 and also tests if M is at position4? If position4 marks M as correct? Then we know.

   So I'll go with GUMMY.

   If the secret is GUMMY, we win.

   If not, then we get feedback:

        Case secret is MUMMY: 
           Guess GUMMY: 
                Position1: G -> x (not in secret MUMMY? MUMMY has no G) 
                Position2: U ✓
                Position3: M ✓
                Position4: M ✓ (because MUMMY has M at position4)
                Position5: Y ✓
           So feedback: G(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(✓) Y(✓)

        Then we know position1 must be something else? The only remaining candidate for position1 (if secret is MUMMY) is M? But we already have M? And we know that the only other word is MUMMY? So we would guess MUMMY next.

        Case secret is JUMBY:
           Guess GUMMY:
                Position1: G vs J -> G not in secret? Since JUMBY uses J,U,M,B,Y? So G not present? x
                Position2: U ✓
                Position3: M ✓
                Position4: M vs B -> M not in secret? Well, secret has only one M at position3, and we matched it? So M at position4 is not present? So x
                Position5: Y ✓
           Feedback: G(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(x) Y(✓)

        Then we know the fourth letter is not M? So among the candidates, that leaves JUMBY? So next guess: JUMBY wins.

   Similarly, if we guess GUMMY and get feedback with M at position4 correct, then we know the word is either GUMMY (if we win) or MUMMY (if we still have to win)? And we can distinguish? 

   Therefore, we should guess GUMMY.

<guess>gummy</guess>
</think>
Based on previous feedback:
- Secret word excludes letters: C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S, D, P
- Must contain U at position 2, M at position 3, and Y at position 5
- Pattern: _ U M _ Y

Possible words fitting the pattern:
- **GUMMY**: Valid English word (chewy candy texture)
- **MUMMY**: Valid English word (preserved corpse)
- **JUMBY**: Valid English word (Caribbean folklore spirit)

Strategic choice for this guess:
- Select **GUMMY** to test:
  - G at position 1 (previously untested common consonant)
  - M at position 4 (to confirm if secret has multiple Ms)
- If correct, game ends. If incorrect, feedback on G and extra M provides critical information to distinguish between MUMMY/JUMBY next.

<guess>gummy</guess>",gummy,"We have feedback from Guess 3: dumpy -> D(x), U(✓), M(✓), P(x), Y(✓)
 This means:
   - U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since U is the second letter in ""dumpy"")
   - M is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since M is the third letter in ""dumpy"")
   - Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since Y is the fifth letter in ""dumpy"")
   - D and P are not in the word.

 Additionally, from previous guesses, we know that the word does not contain:
   C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S, D, P

 So, the excluded letters are: C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S, D, P

 The secret word must have:
   Position 2: U
   Position 3: M
   Position 5: Y

 And we know positions 1 and 4 are letters that are not excluded and not U, M, Y.

 The current pattern is: _ U M _ Y

 We need to fill in the first and fourth positions with letters not in the excluded set and not D or P (which we now know are excluded).

 The total excluded letters so far: C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S,D,P

 The remaining letters (from the alphabet) are: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

 But note that we must choose letters that form a valid English word.

 We also know that the word cannot contain any of the excluded letters, and we have constraints on positions 1 and 4.

 Let's think of words that fit the pattern: ? U M ? Y

 Possible words:
   We need to try combinations for the first and fourth positions from the available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z

 Let me try to brainstorm:
   BUMFY? Not a word.
   FUMBY? Not a word.
   GUMBY? Not a word (unless a proper noun?).
   HUMBY? Not a word.
   JUMBY? JUMBY is a word (a spirit in Caribbean folklore).
   KUMBY? Not a word (like kumbaya? but kumbaya is longer).
   QUM?Y? Q doesn't combine well.

 Another idea: 
   BUMPY? But P is excluded, and also we had P as 'x' in dumpy.
   Something else: 
   ""MUMMY"" -> M is already in position 3? But let's see: M,U,M,M,Y -> however, the pattern requires M at position 3, and U at 2, Y at 5. But the word ""mummy"" has U at position 2? Let's check:
      Position1: M -> but we have position3 fixed as M. So in ""mummy"", the M is at position1 and 3,4. But we know that M is in the word and at position 3. So M at position 1 is allowed? The feedback said M is in the correct position at position 3, but it doesn't say anything about other Ms. However, note that in the guess ""dumpy"", we had M at position 3 and got a correct (✓), so if there were an M at position 1, we wouldn't have known because we didn't test an M at position 1.

 But wait, the feedback for dumpy was for the specific positions: 
   Position 1: D(x) -> so D is not in the word and also D is excluded.
   Position 2: U(✓) -> U is correct and in position.
   Position 3: M(✓) -> M is correct and in position.
   Position 4: P(x) -> P is excluded.
   Position 5: Y(✓) -> Y is correct and in position.

 So, the secret word has U at position 2, M at position 3, Y at position 5, and does not contain D or P.

 Now, considering M: we have M only at position 3? But if the word has another M, like at position 1, it might be possible. However, we haven't tested that.

 But let me list possible words:

 We have the pattern: ? U M ? Y

 The fourth letter cannot be P (excluded) or any of the other excluded ones.

 Let me try to think of valid words:

   * HUMKY? Not a word.
   * JUMBY: J U M B Y -> I think JUMBY is accepted in some dictionaries (as jumbie or jumby).
   * BUMFY? Not a word.
   * FUMFY? Not a word.
   * GUMMY: G U M M Y -> has M at position 4? But we don't know if M is in the word more than once. Also, note that we have excluded P, but not M again. However, GUMMY: 
        G at position 1? Yes, and M at position 4? Then we have M at both position 3 and 4? That might be.

   But in our pattern, position 4 must be filled. Let's check:
        Position1: G
        Position2: U (fixed)
        Position3: M (fixed)
        Position4: M -> this would be a repeated M? And then Y at position5.

   So ""GUMMY"" is a word. And it fits the pattern.

   Another: ""BUMMY"" is not a word.

   Also: ""MUMMY"" would have M at position1 -> but we don't have M at position1 tested? However, the pattern requires position2: U, position3: M, so ""MUMMY"" wouldn't fit because position1 is M and position2 is U? Actually, ""MUMMY"" is M-U-M-M-Y -> so it has U at position2 and M at position3 and Y at position5. So ""MUMMY"" also fits the pattern.

   But note: we have excluded the letter D and P, but not H or G. Also, in ""MUMMY"", the M at position1 might be acceptable? Because we haven't tested position1.

   Other words:
        ""BUMMY"" is not valid.
        ""FUMMY"" is not valid.
        ""HUMMY"" might be considered valid? But not a common word.

   Also: ""JUMMY"" - not a word.

   Let me check: 
        GUMMY and MUMMY are both valid.

   However, note: in GUMMY, the fourth letter is M and fifth is Y. Similarly, MUMMY has M at position1 and M at position4.

   Are there any other words?
        ""VUMBY"" - not a word.
        ""WUMBY"" - not a word.

   So the candidates are:
        GUMMY: G U M M Y
        MUMMY: M U M M Y

   But note: we don't know if there can be more than one M. The feedback only confirmed M at position3, but it might appear elsewhere.

   We must also consider that in the word ""MUMMY"", we have M at position1. But we haven't ruled out M at other positions.

   Another word: ""KUMYS"" but S is excluded, and also it ends with S, not Y? No, KUMYS is not common and ends with S.

   How about ""SUMY""? But we have 5 letters: pattern is 5 letters. ""SUMY"" is 4 letters? No, we need 5.

   So the main possibilities are GUMMY and MUMMY.

   But wait, the feedback from Guess 3: dumpy -> we had M at position3, but if the word has M at position4, it wouldn't have been revealed because we didn't have M in position4. Similarly, for GUMMY, we are putting a G at position1 and M at position4.

   However, note that in our third guess, we didn't test for G or M at other positions? But we tested D at position1 and got x, so position1 cannot be D. Similarly, P at position4 got x.

   Now, we have two possibilities: GUMMY and MUMMY.

   But also, note that we have excluded many letters. For position1, we have tried D (with dumpy) and got x, so position1 cannot be D. Also, from lions and crate, we know position1 is not C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S.

   So for position1, we need a letter from the remaining ones: B,F,G,H,J,K,V,W,X,Y,Z? But Y is already at position5? And we know position1 is Y? Not necessarily, but Y could be in other positions? But note we have Y at position5 marked correct, so Y is fixed there.

   So position1 cannot be Y? Well, we don't know for sure because a word could have multiple Ys? But we don't have information about that.

   However, in the pattern, position5 is Y. So if we put Y at position1, that would be a different Y? But the word may or may not allow multiple Ys.

   But let us consider: 
        For MUMMY: position1 is M -> which is allowed? Because M is in the word (we know M at position3) but having another M is not prohibited. The feedback doesn't say anything against multiple Ms.

   Similarly, for GUMMY: position1 is G, which is not excluded? Because G is not in [C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S,D,P]. So G is available.

   Now, how can we decide? Since we have two possibilities, we might need to choose a word that tests one of these.

   But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since this is the fourth guess, and we have 6 total). We can guess one of them.

   Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses one of the possibilities or a different word that might cover both scenarios.

   However, we can also note:

   - If the word is ""MUMMY"", then position1 must be M. 
   - If the word is ""GUMMY"", then position1 must be G and position4 must be M.

   But are there other words? 

   Let me search: are there any other words that fit ? U M ? Y ?

   We must consider the available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z

   So:
        ? U M [B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z] Y

   We need the whole word to be valid.

   So far, we have:
        M U M M Y -> MUMMY (M at both 1 and 4)
        G U M M Y -> GUMMY (G at 1, M at 4)
        H U M M Y -> HUMMY? Not a word.
        B U M M Y -> BUMMY? Not a word.

   Also, with the fourth letter not M:
        For example: 
           B U M B Y -> BUMBY? Not a word.
           F U M B Y -> FUMBY? Not a word.
           H U M B Y -> HUMBY? Not a word.
           J U M B Y -> JUMBY? We considered JUMBY earlier and it might be acceptable? But note JUMBY is spelled J-U-M-B-Y, so it would work: 
                Position1: J, position2: U, position3: M, position4: B, position5: Y.

           And JUMBY is a word (variant of jumbie).

        Similarly:
           K U M B Y? Not a word.
           V U M B Y? Not a word.

        Another: W U M B Y -> not a word.

        So JUMBY is a candidate.

   Also, what about other letters? For example:
        F U M F Y -> not a word? And F repeated.

   So we have at least three candidates:
      MUMMY, GUMMY, JUMBY

   Now, we need to choose one that will help us disambiguate.

   We have feedback that the word has U, M, Y at positions 2,3,5. And we know the letters D and P are not in the word.

   Now, for the next guess, since we have three possibilities and we must guess one, we might choose the one that tests a letter we haven't tried.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests the first letter more broadly.

   But note: we have only 4 more tries? Actually, we are on the fourth guess. So we can try one of these.

   To maximize information, we might choose a word that includes letters we haven't tried yet.

   Letters we have tried: 
      C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S,D,U,M,P,Y -> and U,M,Y are in the word.

   We haven't tried: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z.

   If we guess MUMMY, note that it only uses M,U,Y and one new letter: M (but we already have M). Actually, no new letters? Because the new M is at position1, but we already know M is in the word? It doesn't test a new letter.

   Similarly, GUMMY tests G and M (already known?) and the M again.

   But JUMBY tests J (which is uncommon) and B, which we haven't tested. But if we guess JUMBY and it's wrong, we have more information?

   Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't assume the fourth letter is M. Because we don't know about position4.

   How about if we don't fix it to M? We could try a word that has a different letter at position4? For example, JUMBY (with B at position4) or perhaps another word.

   The word ""FUM Y"" as in ""FUMAY""? Not a word.

   Another word: ""HUYMY"" - not a word.

   So JUMBY might be our only other candidate.

   Now, let me confirm:

   - MUMMY: accepted word
   - GUMMY: accepted word
   - JUMBY: recognized as a variant of jumbie

   So we have three possibilities.

   Now, to choose one, we might pick the one that tests a letter that appears in other possible words? But there are only three.

   Alternatively, we can pick one that uses common letters? But among B, G, J, which is more common? G is more common, then B, then J.

   But note: the word might be GUMMY, which uses G. Or MUMMY, which uses M (already confirmed). Or JUMBY, which uses J and B.

   Since we don't have information about G or B, we might prefer to test a word that includes G or B.

   We could guess GUMMY? Because if it's GUMMY, we get it right. If not, then feedback might tell us about the first letter.

   Alternatively, we could guess a word that has both G and B? But in the pattern ? U M ? Y, we cannot have both G and B because they must occupy position1 and position4.

   Example: we cannot have G at position1 and B at position4 because then we get ""GUMMY"" replaced by ""GUMBY""? Not a word.

   So we cannot do that.

   Since we are forced to pick one pattern, let's choose GUMMY as our next guess because G is a common letter and might appear in other words? But if we are wrong, we can infer.

   Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not one of these three but tests several possibilities? How? We don't know a word that would.

   Another idea: guess a word that has a different structure? But we must follow the pattern because we know positions 2,3,5 are fixed.

   We cannot change the U, M, Y.

   So we must have U at2, M at3, Y at5.

   Therefore, our guess must be of the form XUMZY, where X and Z are letters from the available set.

   So we have fixed positions.

   We are left to guess positions 1 and 4.

   Given that, we should choose a guess that will address multiple possibilities.

   Unfortunately, since we have very few letters left, we might just have to try one and then deduce.

   Let me assign:

   Position1: can be one of B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z
   Position4: can be one of B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z

   And the word must be valid.

   We found:
      Position4 = M: leads to words with position1 being G, M, H? -> GUMMY, MUMMY, but HUMMY not a word? So only GUMMY and MUMMY.
      Position4 = B: leads to JUMBY (if we accept it) and no other we found.

   Also, position4 = K: we could have ""KUMKY""? No, not a word.

   So the only known words are those three.

   Therefore, we should guess GUMMY? Because it tests G at position1 and M at position4.

   If we guess GUMMY:
        If it is correct: we win.
        If not, feedback will show:
            Position1: G -> if it is x, then we know position1 is not G? Then the word would be MUMMY? But note MUMMY has position1=M. 
            Position4: M -> if it is not in the word? But wait, we already have M at position3. How would M at position4 be marked?

        Let's simulate:

        Case 1: the word is MUMMY.
          Guess: GUMMY -> G (position1): since MUMMY has M at position1, and G is not in MUMMY? So G would be x.
          Position4: M -> but MUMMY has M at position4? But note: the M at position4 is already accounted for? Wait, MUMMY has three Ms: at positions1,3,4. We know about the M at position3 already.

          For feedback: 
            Position1: G vs M -> different, so x (since we don't have a G in MUMMY)
            Position2: U vs U -> ✓
            Position3: M vs M -> ✓
            Position4: M vs M -> ✓? But wait, in MUMMY, there are two Ms besides the one at position3? Actually, the M at position4 is present? So if we have MUMMY, then we have Ms at positions3 and4? So in GUMMY, position4 is M and MUMMY has M at position4? So it's the same. So in feedback, position4 would be ✓? Also, we have an extra M at position1? But in GUMMY we don't have M at position1? 

          Actually, the feedback should be:

            Position1: G? MUMMY has M at position1 -> G is not M and MUMMY doesn't have G? So ✓ should be x.
            Position2: U matches -> ✓
            Position3: M matches -> ✓
            Position4: M matches? Yes -> ✓
            Position5: Y matches -> ✓

          So the feedback would be: G(x), U(✓), M(✓), M(✓), Y(✓)

          But wait: we have used two Ms? The secret word MUMMY has three Ms? How would the feedback handle repeated letters?

          In Wordle, the feedback handles repeated letters carefully: each letter in the guess is matched against the word, giving priority to exact positions, and then any remaining are marked as in word but wrong position? But note: if a letter appears multiple times, it can get multiple matches? Or is it counted as many as in the secret word?

          In standard Wordle, feedback counts each occurrence independently. Since MUMMY has three Ms, and GUMMY has two Ms: 
            Position3: M matched exactly -> uses one occurrence.
            Position4: M matched exactly -> uses another occurrence.
            Then, the M in the secret word at position1 remains? But GUMMY doesn't have an M in position1? So the remaining M is unmatched? But GUMMY has M only at positions3 and4? Not at position1.

          However, in the guess GUMMY, we are not claiming a letter M at position1? The M in GUMMY is only at positions3 and4? So the M at position1 in MUMMY would not be matched? But we don't have to worry about position1 in terms of M? Because we guessed G at position1.

          Therefore, feedback only looks at the position:

            Position1: G (incorrect) -> x
            Position2: U correct -> ✓
            Position3: M correct -> ✓
            Position4: M is correct? Yes, MUMMY has M at position4 -> ✓
            Position5: Y correct -> ✓

          Then, what about the extra M? We don't have a M in GUMMY at position1? So no other M. The secret word has one more M? But we didn't guess it? So it doesn't show up? It would only mark the guessed letters.

          Therefore, feedback: x, ✓, ✓, ✓, ✓

          This wouldn't let us know that the secret word has an M at position1? But we would then know that the first letter must be something else? And that the fourth letter is M. But we would have three ✓ and one x? Then next guess we can try MUMMY?

          Alternatively, if we guess MUMMY and the secret word is GUMMY?

          For MUMMY vs GUMMY:

            Position1: M vs G -> M is not G and GUMMY has M? Where? Position4? But in GUMMY, the M is at position3 and4? So:

              Position1: M (guess) vs G (secret) -> is M in GUMMY? Yes, at positions 3 and 4. But since it's not at position1, it would mark:

                  For position1: M is not in the correct position? But M is in GUMMY? So it would be marked as ""-"" for being in the word but wrong position? 

          Let's follow the rules:

            The secret word GUMMY: positions: G, U, M, M, Y.
            Guess: M U M M Y

            Position1: M -> GUMMY has M? Yes, but not at position1? So it should be ""-"" (wrong position)? 
            Position2: U -> matches -> ✓
            Position3: M -> matches -> ✓
            Position4: M -> matches -> ✓
            Position5: Y -> matches -> ✓

            So feedback: M(-), U(✓), M(✓), M(✓), Y(✓)

          This tells us that M is in the word but wrong position? However, we already fixed M at position3 and4? So we have a contradiction? Because in our pattern, position3 and4 are M? And we get ✓ at 3 and 4? Then where is the extra M? Why position1 gets ""-"" meaning it's present elsewhere? But elsewhere includes position3 and4? That might confuse.

          In fact, the feedback system counts each occurrence: GUMMY has two Ms? We guess three Ms? Only two are correct? How?

          Actually, GUMMY has two Ms: one at position3 and one at position4? So the guess ""MUMMY"" has three Ms: position1,3,4.

          In the guess:
            Position1: M -> GUMMY has M? Yes, but not at position1? So one of the Ms in the secret is assigned to this? Or one of the Ms is assigned to the exact matches?

          Typical Wordle feedback assigns green (correct) first, then yellow for any unmatched letters in the word.

          Steps:

            1. Mark exact matches: position2: U, position3: M, position4: M, position5: Y -> four ✓.
            2. For any non-exact, check if the letter appears: position1: M -> is there an M in the secret that isn't matched? But we already matched both Ms in the secret? So no, position1 should be x? 

          Therefore, the feedback for GUMMY against the guess MUMMY would be:
            Position1: M -> x (because both Ms in GUMMY are already matched at positions3 and4)
            Position2: ✓
            Position3: ✓
            Position4: ✓
            Position5: ✓

          So it would be M(x), U(✓), M(✓), M(✓), Y(✓)

          Similarly, if we guess JUMBY against MUMMY:

            Position1: J -> x (if secret is MUMMY, J is not present)
            Position2: U -> ✓
            Position3: M -> ✓
            Position4: B -> vs M? Is B in the word? If secret is MUMMY, no -> x
            Position5: Y -> ✓
            So feedback: J(x), U(✓), M(✓), B(x), Y(✓) -> x,✓,✓,x,✓

   Given that, we might choose JUMBY? Because it tests two new letters: J and B? And we can get more information.

   But note: if JUMBY is the word, we get everything correct.

   Alternatively, we can choose MUMMY? Because M is already confirmed? But not at position1.

   Actually, we have no information about position1 and position4? So guessing MUMMY may be premature.

   We are allowed to try words that help disambiguate.

   Since we have three words:

     Option1: GUMMY -> has letters G, U, M, M, Y -> and we know U, M, Y for sure? But G is the unknown.
     Option2: MUMMY -> has M, U, M, M, Y -> M at position1 is the unknown? But already we have M.
     Option3: JUMBY -> has J, U, M, B, Y -> J and B are unknowns.

   If we guess JUMBY:

        If the secret is GUMMY: 
          Guess: J U M B Y vs G U M M Y 
          Position1: J vs G -> not match, and J is not in GUMMY -> J(x)
          Position2: U ✓
          Position3: M ✓
          Position4: B vs M -> different, and B not in GUMMY -> B(x)
          Position5: Y ✓
          And note: the M we have at position3 matches, but GUMMY has another M at position4? We don't have a B? So feedback: J(x) U(✓) M(✓) B(x) Y(✓)

        This doesn't reveal the M at position4? We would know that position4 is not B.

        But we would know that the secret has no J, no B? So then we might go to GUMMY in the next guess? But we didn't get information about the fourth letter?

        Alternatively, if the secret is GUMMY, we would have no knowledge that the fourth letter is M? Because in our guess we used B at position4? So we didn't test M at position4.

        Then next guess we might try GUMMY and win? Or try to test M?

   Given these, I think it's better to guess GUMMY because it tests a common letter G at position1 and also tests if M is at position4? If position4 marks M as correct? Then we know.

   So I'll go with GUMMY.

   If the secret is GUMMY, we win.

   If not, then we get feedback:

        Case secret is MUMMY: 
           Guess GUMMY: 
                Position1: G -> x (not in secret MUMMY? MUMMY has no G) 
                Position2: U ✓
                Position3: M ✓
                Position4: M ✓ (because MUMMY has M at position4)
                Position5: Y ✓
           So feedback: G(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(✓) Y(✓)

        Then we know position1 must be something else? The only remaining candidate for position1 (if secret is MUMMY) is M? But we already have M? And we know that the only other word is MUMMY? So we would guess MUMMY next.

        Case secret is JUMBY:
           Guess GUMMY:
                Position1: G vs J -> G not in secret? Since JUMBY uses J,U,M,B,Y? So G not present? x
                Position2: U ✓
                Position3: M ✓
                Position4: M vs B -> M not in secret? Well, secret has only one M at position3, and we matched it? So M at position4 is not present? So x
                Position5: Y ✓
           Feedback: G(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(x) Y(✓)

        Then we know the fourth letter is not M? So among the candidates, that leaves JUMBY? So next guess: JUMBY wins.

   Similarly, if we guess GUMMY and get feedback with M at position4 correct, then we know the word is either GUMMY (if we win) or MUMMY (if we still have to win)? And we can distinguish? 

   Therefore, we should guess GUMMY.

<guess>gummy</guess>Based on previous feedback:
- Secret word excludes letters: C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S, D, P
- Must contain U at position 2, M at position 3, and Y at position 5
- Pattern: _ U M _ Y

Possible words fitting the pattern:
- **GUMMY**: Valid English word (chewy candy texture)
- **MUMMY**: Valid English word (preserved corpse)
- **JUMBY**: Valid English word (Caribbean folklore spirit)

Strategic choice for this guess:
- Select **GUMMY** to test:
  - G at position 1 (previously untested common consonant)
  - M at position 4 (to confirm if secret has multiple Ms)
- If correct, game ends. If incorrect, feedback on G and extra M provides critical information to distinguish between MUMMY/JUMBY next.",Guess 4: gummy -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, I don't have any prior feedback.
 The goal is to choose a word that can give good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.
 A common strategy is to pick a word that contains common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

 Let me choose a word that has:
 - Multiple common vowels (like A, E) and common consonants (like R, S, T).
 This might help reveal several letters.

 I'll choose: CRATE

 Why?
 - It has the letters C, R, A, T, E. These are common letters.
 - The word includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, T).

 This word might give feedback on:
   Whether any of these letters are in the secret word and if they are in the correct positions.

 Now, I'll put my guess in the required format.I need to make the first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior information, I'll choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and vowel-consonant balance. A strong starting word should include frequently used letters in English 5-letter words. 

After considering options like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", I select **CRATE** because:
- It contains 2 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, T)
- C, R, A, T, and E all appear frequently in English words
- If any letters match or appear, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities significantly

This choice sets a solid foundation for subsequent guesses based on the feedback symbols.

 This means that none of the letters C, R, A, T, E are in the secret word.

 Therefore, the secret word does not contain these letters: C, R, A, T, E.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not include any of these letters.

 Now, we must consider other common letters. We should avoid letters that we now know are not in the word.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words that are not in the set {C, R, A, T, E} include:
   S, L, N, I, O, U, D, G, H, K, M, P, B, V, Y, W, F, J, Z, etc.

 Since the previous word had no matches, we want to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 A good second guess might be words that include letters like S, L, N, O, I.

 Example: ""SPOIL"", ""LIONS"", ""NOISE"", etc.

 However, note that we must avoid the excluded letters.

 Let's generate a word that uses common letters not yet tried.

 Consider ""S"", ""L"", ""N"", ""O"", ""I"" — these are very common.

 A candidate word: ""SOLID"" — but D might not be as common? Alternatively, ""LINKS"" or ""POUND"".

 We also want to maximize the chance of getting positional information.

 Another idea: ""HOIST"" — but this has H, O, I, S, T. However, T was already excluded? Wait, T was in crate and was excluded. So we cannot use T.

 We must avoid T because the feedback for crate had T as ""x"".

 Therefore, we need a word without C, R, A, T, E.

 Let me propose ""SPOIL"":
   S, P, O, I, L — none of these are in the excluded set.

 Alternatively, ""NOISY"" — N, O, I, S, Y.

 But I think ""SPOIL"" is reasonable.

 However, we have no information yet. Another option: ""SHOWN"" — S, H, O, W, N.

 To cover more common letters, consider ""SLIMY"" or ""PIOUS"".

 I'll go with ""SLIPY"" — but that's not a word? We need a valid word.

 Let me try: ""SPOIL"" is valid.

 Another common second guess in Wordle after excluding a bunch of letters is using the word ""POUND"".

 Since A, E, I, O, U are vowels, but we know A and E are out, so we should include O and I? And maybe U.

 So ""POUND"" — P, O, U, N, D — that avoids the excluded letters.

 However, note that ""crate"" used E and A, so the secret word must use other vowels, likely O, I, U, or sometimes Y.

 We have two options:

 Option 1: ""SPOIL"": S, P, O, I, L
 Option 2: ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D

 Let's compare:

 ""SPOIL"" has S, P, O, I, L — these are all relatively common. S, L, O are very common.
 ""POUND"" has P, O, U, N, D — U is less common? But N is common.

 Alternatively, ""LIONS"" — L, I, O, N, S — that has S, L, O, I, N. That also covers many common letters.

 I think ""LIONS"" might be better because it includes both L, I, O, N, S — which are all common.

 But note: ""LIONS"" is a valid word.

 So I'll choose ""LIONS"": 
   Letters: L, I, O, N, S — all not previously excluded.

 This will test:
   L, I, O, N, S — which are common.

 Then, based on the feedback, we can narrow down.

 Therefore, the guess is ""lions"".

<guess>lions</guess>After the first guess ""crate"" revealed that none of the letters C, R, A, T, or E appear in the secret word, my approach for the second guess focuses on:
1. Avoiding all excluded letters (C, R, A, T, E)
2. Testing new common letters to maximize information gain
3. Prioritizing letters like S, L, O, I, N which frequently appear in 5-letter words

I selected **LIONS** because:
- ✓ Contains high-frequency consonants (S, N, L) and vowels (O, I)
- ✓ Tests 5 entirely new letters: L, I, O, N, S
- ✓ Valid English word that may reveal vowel positions and common consonants
- ✘ No overlap with excluded letters from first guess

This choice builds on the elimination strategy—feedback will help identify which of these new letters are present and their positions.

<guess>lions</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: lions -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(x) O(x) N(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses with all letters incorrect:
  Guess 1: crate -> C, R, A, T, E are not in the word.
  Guess 2: lions -> L, I, O, N, S are not in the word.

 So, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S.

 Now, we have to choose a word that uses letters not in the above set.

 The remaining letters in the alphabet are:
   B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We need to form a 5-letter word from these.

 Common letters from the remaining: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

 We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in one guess.

 Let's think of words that use these letters.

 Some possibilities:
   ""DUMPY"" - D, U, M, P, Y
   ""BUGGY"" - B, U, G, G, Y (but G repeated, might not be ideal for information)
   ""HUMPH"" - H, U, M, P, H (repeated H, and not common)
   ""JUMPY"" - J, U, M, P, Y (J is less common)
   ""FUDGY"" - F, U, D, G, Y
   ""PUDGY"" - P, U, D, G, Y

 We want to avoid rare letters if possible. J, Q, X, Z are less common.

 Let's try to find a word that uses B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y without repetition.

 Another idea: ""MUCKY"" - M, U, C, K, Y -> but C is already excluded (from crate) so we cannot use C.

 We must remember the excluded letters: C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S.

 So, we cannot use C.

 Let me try ""DUMPY"": D, U, M, P, Y -> all allowed.

 Is ""DUMPY"" a word? Yes, meaning gloomy or damp.

 Another: ""HUMPH"" is a word but has two H's.

 ""BUGGY"" has two G's.

 ""JUMPY"" is a word: J, U, M, P, Y.

 But J is less common, so maybe avoid.

 ""FUDGY"": F, U, D, G, Y -> valid.

 ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> valid.

 Both ""FUDGY"" and ""PUDGY"" are similar. We can choose one.

 Alternatively, ""MUDDY"" - M, U, D, D, Y -> repeated D.

 ""DUCHY"" - D, U, C, H, Y -> but C is excluded.

 ""DOWDY"" - D, O, W, D, Y -> O is excluded.

 ""GUMPS"" - G, U, M, P, S -> S is excluded.

 So, we need to avoid the excluded letters.

 Let's list possible words:

   DUMPY: D, U, M, P, Y
   FUDGY: F, U, D, G, Y
   PUDGY: P, U, D, G, Y
   JUMPY: J, U, M, P, Y
   BUMPY: B, U, M, P, Y
   HUMPY: H, U, M, P, Y (less common word, but valid as an adjective meaning hump-like)

 We can also consider:
   ""DUMKY"" - not a word.
   ""DUVET"" - D, U, V, E, T -> E and T are excluded.

 Another: ""WIMPY"" - W, I, M, P, Y -> I is excluded.

 ""YUKKY"" - Y, U, K, K, Y -> repeated letters and not very common.

 ""PUKKA"" - P, U, K, K, A -> A is excluded.

 So, let's stick with words like DUMPY, FUDGY, PUDGY, BUMPY.

 We want to maximize the coverage of new letters. 

 In DUMPY: D, U, M, P, Y -> 5 distinct letters.
 In FUDGY: F, U, D, G, Y -> 5 distinct letters.
 In PUDGY: P, U, D, G, Y -> 5 distinct letters? Actually, PUDGY has P, U, D, G, Y -> distinct.

 But note: in FUDGY and PUDGY, we have U, D, G, Y in common, and either F or P.

 We also have BUMPY: B, U, M, P, Y -> distinct.

 Since we have no information, we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

 Among the available letters, common ones in English 5-letter words are:
   B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, Y.

 We don't have H, K, W in the words above? 

 Let me try to find a word that includes H or K or W.

 For example:
   ""WHACK"" - W, H, A, C, K -> A and C excluded.
   ""MUCKY"" - M, U, C, K, Y -> C excluded.
   ""HUMAN"" - H, U, M, A, N -> A and N excluded.

 It's hard to include H, K, W without using excluded letters.

 Another word: ""DOWRY"" - D, O, W, R, Y -> O and R excluded.

 ""HOWDY"" - H, O, W, D, Y -> O excluded.

 ""WACKY"" - W, A, C, K, Y -> A and C excluded.

 So, we might not be able to include W, H, K easily without repetition or using excluded letters.

 Therefore, we can choose one of the words we have.

 Let's choose ""DUMPY"" because it uses M and P, which are common, and Y which is sometimes a vowel.

 Alternatively, ""FUDGY"" uses F and G, which are also common.

 But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We need to get as much information as possible.

 I think ""DUMPY"" is a good choice.

 However, let me check if there's a word that uses more common letters. The most common letters left are: D, M, P, B, F, G, U, Y.

 We can try to form a word with B, D, F, G, M, P, U, Y.

 Since we can only use 5, we have to pick 5.

 Another word: ""GUMPY"" - not a word.

 ""BUDGY"" - not a word.

 ""DUMPY"" seems fine.

 I'll go with ""DUMPY"".

<guess>dumpy</guess>After two guesses with all letters incorrect (CRATE and LIONS), the secret word contains none of these 10 letters: **C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S**. 

For the third guess, I need to:
1. **Avoid all excluded letters** above
2. **Test new high-frequency consonants and vowels** from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
3. **Maximize letter coverage** with 5 distinct letters to gather new information

After evaluating options like FUDGY (F,U,D,G,Y) and BUMPY (B,U,M,P,Y), I selected **DUMPY** because:
- ✓ Uses 5 new common letters: **D, U, M, P, Y**
- ✓ Avoids rare letters (J, Q, X, Z) and repeated characters
- ✓ Tests U (vowel) and frequent consonants (D, M, P)
- ✓ Valid English word (meaning gloomy/dim)

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities by checking a new set of letters.

<guess>dumpy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: lions -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(x) O(x) N(x) S(x)
Guess 3: dumpy -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(✓) M(✓) P(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from Guess 3: dumpy -> D(x), U(✓), M(✓), P(x), Y(✓)
 This means:
   - U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since U is the second letter in ""dumpy"")
   - M is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since M is the third letter in ""dumpy"")
   - Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since Y is the fifth letter in ""dumpy"")
   - D and P are not in the word.

 Additionally, from previous guesses, we know that the word does not contain:
   C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S, D, P

 So, the excluded letters are: C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S, D, P

 The secret word must have:
   Position 2: U
   Position 3: M
   Position 5: Y

 And we know positions 1 and 4 are letters that are not excluded and not U, M, Y.

 The current pattern is: _ U M _ Y

 We need to fill in the first and fourth positions with letters not in the excluded set and not D or P (which we now know are excluded).

 The total excluded letters so far: C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S,D,P

 The remaining letters (from the alphabet) are: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

 But note that we must choose letters that form a valid English word.

 We also know that the word cannot contain any of the excluded letters, and we have constraints on positions 1 and 4.

 Let's think of words that fit the pattern: ? U M ? Y

 Possible words:
   We need to try combinations for the first and fourth positions from the available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z

 Let me try to brainstorm:
   BUMFY? Not a word.
   FUMBY? Not a word.
   GUMBY? Not a word (unless a proper noun?).
   HUMBY? Not a word.
   JUMBY? JUMBY is a word (a spirit in Caribbean folklore).
   KUMBY? Not a word (like kumbaya? but kumbaya is longer).
   QUM?Y? Q doesn't combine well.

 Another idea: 
   BUMPY? But P is excluded, and also we had P as 'x' in dumpy.
   Something else: 
   ""MUMMY"" -> M is already in position 3? But let's see: M,U,M,M,Y -> however, the pattern requires M at position 3, and U at 2, Y at 5. But the word ""mummy"" has U at position 2? Let's check:
      Position1: M -> but we have position3 fixed as M. So in ""mummy"", the M is at position1 and 3,4. But we know that M is in the word and at position 3. So M at position 1 is allowed? The feedback said M is in the correct position at position 3, but it doesn't say anything about other Ms. However, note that in the guess ""dumpy"", we had M at position 3 and got a correct (✓), so if there were an M at position 1, we wouldn't have known because we didn't test an M at position 1.

 But wait, the feedback for dumpy was for the specific positions: 
   Position 1: D(x) -> so D is not in the word and also D is excluded.
   Position 2: U(✓) -> U is correct and in position.
   Position 3: M(✓) -> M is correct and in position.
   Position 4: P(x) -> P is excluded.
   Position 5: Y(✓) -> Y is correct and in position.

 So, the secret word has U at position 2, M at position 3, Y at position 5, and does not contain D or P.

 Now, considering M: we have M only at position 3? But if the word has another M, like at position 1, it might be possible. However, we haven't tested that.

 But let me list possible words:

 We have the pattern: ? U M ? Y

 The fourth letter cannot be P (excluded) or any of the other excluded ones.

 Let me try to think of valid words:

   * HUMKY? Not a word.
   * JUMBY: J U M B Y -> I think JUMBY is accepted in some dictionaries (as jumbie or jumby).
   * BUMFY? Not a word.
   * FUMFY? Not a word.
   * GUMMY: G U M M Y -> has M at position 4? But we don't know if M is in the word more than once. Also, note that we have excluded P, but not M again. However, GUMMY: 
        G at position 1? Yes, and M at position 4? Then we have M at both position 3 and 4? That might be.

   But in our pattern, position 4 must be filled. Let's check:
        Position1: G
        Position2: U (fixed)
        Position3: M (fixed)
        Position4: M -> this would be a repeated M? And then Y at position5.

   So ""GUMMY"" is a word. And it fits the pattern.

   Another: ""BUMMY"" is not a word.

   Also: ""MUMMY"" would have M at position1 -> but we don't have M at position1 tested? However, the pattern requires position2: U, position3: M, so ""MUMMY"" wouldn't fit because position1 is M and position2 is U? Actually, ""MUMMY"" is M-U-M-M-Y -> so it has U at position2 and M at position3 and Y at position5. So ""MUMMY"" also fits the pattern.

   But note: we have excluded the letter D and P, but not H or G. Also, in ""MUMMY"", the M at position1 might be acceptable? Because we haven't tested position1.

   Other words:
        ""BUMMY"" is not valid.
        ""FUMMY"" is not valid.
        ""HUMMY"" might be considered valid? But not a common word.

   Also: ""JUMMY"" - not a word.

   Let me check: 
        GUMMY and MUMMY are both valid.

   However, note: in GUMMY, the fourth letter is M and fifth is Y. Similarly, MUMMY has M at position1 and M at position4.

   Are there any other words?
        ""VUMBY"" - not a word.
        ""WUMBY"" - not a word.

   So the candidates are:
        GUMMY: G U M M Y
        MUMMY: M U M M Y

   But note: we don't know if there can be more than one M. The feedback only confirmed M at position3, but it might appear elsewhere.

   We must also consider that in the word ""MUMMY"", we have M at position1. But we haven't ruled out M at other positions.

   Another word: ""KUMYS"" but S is excluded, and also it ends with S, not Y? No, KUMYS is not common and ends with S.

   How about ""SUMY""? But we have 5 letters: pattern is 5 letters. ""SUMY"" is 4 letters? No, we need 5.

   So the main possibilities are GUMMY and MUMMY.

   But wait, the feedback from Guess 3: dumpy -> we had M at position3, but if the word has M at position4, it wouldn't have been revealed because we didn't have M in position4. Similarly, for GUMMY, we are putting a G at position1 and M at position4.

   However, note that in our third guess, we didn't test for G or M at other positions? But we tested D at position1 and got x, so position1 cannot be D. Similarly, P at position4 got x.

   Now, we have two possibilities: GUMMY and MUMMY.

   But also, note that we have excluded many letters. For position1, we have tried D (with dumpy) and got x, so position1 cannot be D. Also, from lions and crate, we know position1 is not C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S.

   So for position1, we need a letter from the remaining ones: B,F,G,H,J,K,V,W,X,Y,Z? But Y is already at position5? And we know position1 is Y? Not necessarily, but Y could be in other positions? But note we have Y at position5 marked correct, so Y is fixed there.

   So position1 cannot be Y? Well, we don't know for sure because a word could have multiple Ys? But we don't have information about that.

   However, in the pattern, position5 is Y. So if we put Y at position1, that would be a different Y? But the word may or may not allow multiple Ys.

   But let us consider: 
        For MUMMY: position1 is M -> which is allowed? Because M is in the word (we know M at position3) but having another M is not prohibited. The feedback doesn't say anything against multiple Ms.

   Similarly, for GUMMY: position1 is G, which is not excluded? Because G is not in [C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S,D,P]. So G is available.

   Now, how can we decide? Since we have two possibilities, we might need to choose a word that tests one of these.

   But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since this is the fourth guess, and we have 6 total). We can guess one of them.

   Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses one of the possibilities or a different word that might cover both scenarios.

   However, we can also note:

   - If the word is ""MUMMY"", then position1 must be M. 
   - If the word is ""GUMMY"", then position1 must be G and position4 must be M.

   But are there other words? 

   Let me search: are there any other words that fit ? U M ? Y ?

   We must consider the available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z

   So:
        ? U M [B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z] Y

   We need the whole word to be valid.

   So far, we have:
        M U M M Y -> MUMMY (M at both 1 and 4)
        G U M M Y -> GUMMY (G at 1, M at 4)
        H U M M Y -> HUMMY? Not a word.
        B U M M Y -> BUMMY? Not a word.

   Also, with the fourth letter not M:
        For example: 
           B U M B Y -> BUMBY? Not a word.
           F U M B Y -> FUMBY? Not a word.
           H U M B Y -> HUMBY? Not a word.
           J U M B Y -> JUMBY? We considered JUMBY earlier and it might be acceptable? But note JUMBY is spelled J-U-M-B-Y, so it would work: 
                Position1: J, position2: U, position3: M, position4: B, position5: Y.

           And JUMBY is a word (variant of jumbie).

        Similarly:
           K U M B Y? Not a word.
           V U M B Y? Not a word.

        Another: W U M B Y -> not a word.

        So JUMBY is a candidate.

   Also, what about other letters? For example:
        F U M F Y -> not a word? And F repeated.

   So we have at least three candidates:
      MUMMY, GUMMY, JUMBY

   Now, we need to choose one that will help us disambiguate.

   We have feedback that the word has U, M, Y at positions 2,3,5. And we know the letters D and P are not in the word.

   Now, for the next guess, since we have three possibilities and we must guess one, we might choose the one that tests a letter we haven't tried.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests the first letter more broadly.

   But note: we have only 4 more tries? Actually, we are on the fourth guess. So we can try one of these.

   To maximize information, we might choose a word that includes letters we haven't tried yet.

   Letters we have tried: 
      C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S,D,U,M,P,Y -> and U,M,Y are in the word.

   We haven't tried: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z.

   If we guess MUMMY, note that it only uses M,U,Y and one new letter: M (but we already have M). Actually, no new letters? Because the new M is at position1, but we already know M is in the word? It doesn't test a new letter.

   Similarly, GUMMY tests G and M (already known?) and the M again.

   But JUMBY tests J (which is uncommon) and B, which we haven't tested. But if we guess JUMBY and it's wrong, we have more information?

   Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't assume the fourth letter is M. Because we don't know about position4.

   How about if we don't fix it to M? We could try a word that has a different letter at position4? For example, JUMBY (with B at position4) or perhaps another word.

   The word ""FUM Y"" as in ""FUMAY""? Not a word.

   Another word: ""HUYMY"" - not a word.

   So JUMBY might be our only other candidate.

   Now, let me confirm:

   - MUMMY: accepted word
   - GUMMY: accepted word
   - JUMBY: recognized as a variant of jumbie

   So we have three possibilities.

   Now, to choose one, we might pick the one that tests a letter that appears in other possible words? But there are only three.

   Alternatively, we can pick one that uses common letters? But among B, G, J, which is more common? G is more common, then B, then J.

   But note: the word might be GUMMY, which uses G. Or MUMMY, which uses M (already confirmed). Or JUMBY, which uses J and B.

   Since we don't have information about G or B, we might prefer to test a word that includes G or B.

   We could guess GUMMY? Because if it's GUMMY, we get it right. If not, then feedback might tell us about the first letter.

   Alternatively, we could guess a word that has both G and B? But in the pattern ? U M ? Y, we cannot have both G and B because they must occupy position1 and position4.

   Example: we cannot have G at position1 and B at position4 because then we get ""GUMMY"" replaced by ""GUMBY""? Not a word.

   So we cannot do that.

   Since we are forced to pick one pattern, let's choose GUMMY as our next guess because G is a common letter and might appear in other words? But if we are wrong, we can infer.

   Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not one of these three but tests several possibilities? How? We don't know a word that would.

   Another idea: guess a word that has a different structure? But we must follow the pattern because we know positions 2,3,5 are fixed.

   We cannot change the U, M, Y.

   So we must have U at2, M at3, Y at5.

   Therefore, our guess must be of the form XUMZY, where X and Z are letters from the available set.

   So we have fixed positions.

   We are left to guess positions 1 and 4.

   Given that, we should choose a guess that will address multiple possibilities.

   Unfortunately, since we have very few letters left, we might just have to try one and then deduce.

   Let me assign:

   Position1: can be one of B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z
   Position4: can be one of B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z

   And the word must be valid.

   We found:
      Position4 = M: leads to words with position1 being G, M, H? -> GUMMY, MUMMY, but HUMMY not a word? So only GUMMY and MUMMY.
      Position4 = B: leads to JUMBY (if we accept it) and no other we found.

   Also, position4 = K: we could have ""KUMKY""? No, not a word.

   So the only known words are those three.

   Therefore, we should guess GUMMY? Because it tests G at position1 and M at position4.

   If we guess GUMMY:
        If it is correct: we win.
        If not, feedback will show:
            Position1: G -> if it is x, then we know position1 is not G? Then the word would be MUMMY? But note MUMMY has position1=M. 
            Position4: M -> if it is not in the word? But wait, we already have M at position3. How would M at position4 be marked?

        Let's simulate:

        Case 1: the word is MUMMY.
          Guess: GUMMY -> G (position1): since MUMMY has M at position1, and G is not in MUMMY? So G would be x.
          Position4: M -> but MUMMY has M at position4? But note: the M at position4 is already accounted for? Wait, MUMMY has three Ms: at positions1,3,4. We know about the M at position3 already.

          For feedback: 
            Position1: G vs M -> different, so x (since we don't have a G in MUMMY)
            Position2: U vs U -> ✓
            Position3: M vs M -> ✓
            Position4: M vs M -> ✓? But wait, in MUMMY, there are two Ms besides the one at position3? Actually, the M at position4 is present? So if we have MUMMY, then we have Ms at positions3 and4? So in GUMMY, position4 is M and MUMMY has M at position4? So it's the same. So in feedback, position4 would be ✓? Also, we have an extra M at position1? But in GUMMY we don't have M at position1? 

          Actually, the feedback should be:

            Position1: G? MUMMY has M at position1 -> G is not M and MUMMY doesn't have G? So ✓ should be x.
            Position2: U matches -> ✓
            Position3: M matches -> ✓
            Position4: M matches? Yes -> ✓
            Position5: Y matches -> ✓

          So the feedback would be: G(x), U(✓), M(✓), M(✓), Y(✓)

          But wait: we have used two Ms? The secret word MUMMY has three Ms? How would the feedback handle repeated letters?

          In Wordle, the feedback handles repeated letters carefully: each letter in the guess is matched against the word, giving priority to exact positions, and then any remaining are marked as in word but wrong position? But note: if a letter appears multiple times, it can get multiple matches? Or is it counted as many as in the secret word?

          In standard Wordle, feedback counts each occurrence independently. Since MUMMY has three Ms, and GUMMY has two Ms: 
            Position3: M matched exactly -> uses one occurrence.
            Position4: M matched exactly -> uses another occurrence.
            Then, the M in the secret word at position1 remains? But GUMMY doesn't have an M in position1? So the remaining M is unmatched? But GUMMY has M only at positions3 and4? Not at position1.

          However, in the guess GUMMY, we are not claiming a letter M at position1? The M in GUMMY is only at positions3 and4? So the M at position1 in MUMMY would not be matched? But we don't have to worry about position1 in terms of M? Because we guessed G at position1.

          Therefore, feedback only looks at the position:

            Position1: G (incorrect) -> x
            Position2: U correct -> ✓
            Position3: M correct -> ✓
            Position4: M is correct? Yes, MUMMY has M at position4 -> ✓
            Position5: Y correct -> ✓

          Then, what about the extra M? We don't have a M in GUMMY at position1? So no other M. The secret word has one more M? But we didn't guess it? So it doesn't show up? It would only mark the guessed letters.

          Therefore, feedback: x, ✓, ✓, ✓, ✓

          This wouldn't let us know that the secret word has an M at position1? But we would then know that the first letter must be something else? And that the fourth letter is M. But we would have three ✓ and one x? Then next guess we can try MUMMY?

          Alternatively, if we guess MUMMY and the secret word is GUMMY?

          For MUMMY vs GUMMY:

            Position1: M vs G -> M is not G and GUMMY has M? Where? Position4? But in GUMMY, the M is at position3 and4? So:

              Position1: M (guess) vs G (secret) -> is M in GUMMY? Yes, at positions 3 and 4. But since it's not at position1, it would mark:

                  For position1: M is not in the correct position? But M is in GUMMY? So it would be marked as ""-"" for being in the word but wrong position? 

          Let's follow the rules:

            The secret word GUMMY: positions: G, U, M, M, Y.
            Guess: M U M M Y

            Position1: M -> GUMMY has M? Yes, but not at position1? So it should be ""-"" (wrong position)? 
            Position2: U -> matches -> ✓
            Position3: M -> matches -> ✓
            Position4: M -> matches -> ✓
            Position5: Y -> matches -> ✓

            So feedback: M(-), U(✓), M(✓), M(✓), Y(✓)

          This tells us that M is in the word but wrong position? However, we already fixed M at position3 and4? So we have a contradiction? Because in our pattern, position3 and4 are M? And we get ✓ at 3 and 4? Then where is the extra M? Why position1 gets ""-"" meaning it's present elsewhere? But elsewhere includes position3 and4? That might confuse.

          In fact, the feedback system counts each occurrence: GUMMY has two Ms? We guess three Ms? Only two are correct? How?

          Actually, GUMMY has two Ms: one at position3 and one at position4? So the guess ""MUMMY"" has three Ms: position1,3,4.

          In the guess:
            Position1: M -> GUMMY has M? Yes, but not at position1? So one of the Ms in the secret is assigned to this? Or one of the Ms is assigned to the exact matches?

          Typical Wordle feedback assigns green (correct) first, then yellow for any unmatched letters in the word.

          Steps:

            1. Mark exact matches: position2: U, position3: M, position4: M, position5: Y -> four ✓.
            2. For any non-exact, check if the letter appears: position1: M -> is there an M in the secret that isn't matched? But we already matched both Ms in the secret? So no, position1 should be x? 

          Therefore, the feedback for GUMMY against the guess MUMMY would be:
            Position1: M -> x (because both Ms in GUMMY are already matched at positions3 and4)
            Position2: ✓
            Position3: ✓
            Position4: ✓
            Position5: ✓

          So it would be M(x), U(✓), M(✓), M(✓), Y(✓)

          Similarly, if we guess JUMBY against MUMMY:

            Position1: J -> x (if secret is MUMMY, J is not present)
            Position2: U -> ✓
            Position3: M -> ✓
            Position4: B -> vs M? Is B in the word? If secret is MUMMY, no -> x
            Position5: Y -> ✓
            So feedback: J(x), U(✓), M(✓), B(x), Y(✓) -> x,✓,✓,x,✓

   Given that, we might choose JUMBY? Because it tests two new letters: J and B? And we can get more information.

   But note: if JUMBY is the word, we get everything correct.

   Alternatively, we can choose MUMMY? Because M is already confirmed? But not at position1.

   Actually, we have no information about position1 and position4? So guessing MUMMY may be premature.

   We are allowed to try words that help disambiguate.

   Since we have three words:

     Option1: GUMMY -> has letters G, U, M, M, Y -> and we know U, M, Y for sure? But G is the unknown.
     Option2: MUMMY -> has M, U, M, M, Y -> M at position1 is the unknown? But already we have M.
     Option3: JUMBY -> has J, U, M, B, Y -> J and B are unknowns.

   If we guess JUMBY:

        If the secret is GUMMY: 
          Guess: J U M B Y vs G U M M Y 
          Position1: J vs G -> not match, and J is not in GUMMY -> J(x)
          Position2: U ✓
          Position3: M ✓
          Position4: B vs M -> different, and B not in GUMMY -> B(x)
          Position5: Y ✓
          And note: the M we have at position3 matches, but GUMMY has another M at position4? We don't have a B? So feedback: J(x) U(✓) M(✓) B(x) Y(✓)

        This doesn't reveal the M at position4? We would know that position4 is not B.

        But we would know that the secret has no J, no B? So then we might go to GUMMY in the next guess? But we didn't get information about the fourth letter?

        Alternatively, if the secret is GUMMY, we would have no knowledge that the fourth letter is M? Because in our guess we used B at position4? So we didn't test M at position4.

        Then next guess we might try GUMMY and win? Or try to test M?

   Given these, I think it's better to guess GUMMY because it tests a common letter G at position1 and also tests if M is at position4? If position4 marks M as correct? Then we know.

   So I'll go with GUMMY.

   If the secret is GUMMY, we win.

   If not, then we get feedback:

        Case secret is MUMMY: 
           Guess GUMMY: 
                Position1: G -> x (not in secret MUMMY? MUMMY has no G) 
                Position2: U ✓
                Position3: M ✓
                Position4: M ✓ (because MUMMY has M at position4)
                Position5: Y ✓
           So feedback: G(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(✓) Y(✓)

        Then we know position1 must be something else? The only remaining candidate for position1 (if secret is MUMMY) is M? But we already have M? And we know that the only other word is MUMMY? So we would guess MUMMY next.

        Case secret is JUMBY:
           Guess GUMMY:
                Position1: G vs J -> G not in secret? Since JUMBY uses J,U,M,B,Y? So G not present? x
                Position2: U ✓
                Position3: M ✓
                Position4: M vs B -> M not in secret? Well, secret has only one M at position3, and we matched it? So M at position4 is not present? So x
                Position5: Y ✓
           Feedback: G(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(x) Y(✓)

        Then we know the fourth letter is not M? So among the candidates, that leaves JUMBY? So next guess: JUMBY wins.

   Similarly, if we guess GUMMY and get feedback with M at position4 correct, then we know the word is either GUMMY (if we win) or MUMMY (if we still have to win)? And we can distinguish? 

   Therefore, we should guess GUMMY.

<guess>gummy</guess>Based on previous feedback:
- Secret word excludes letters: C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S, D, P
- Must contain U at position 2, M at position 3, and Y at position 5
- Pattern: _ U M _ Y

Possible words fitting the pattern:
- **GUMMY**: Valid English word (chewy candy texture)
- **MUMMY**: Valid English word (preserved corpse)
- **JUMBY**: Valid English word (Caribbean folklore spirit)

Strategic choice for this guess:
- Select **GUMMY** to test:
  - G at position 1 (previously untested common consonant)
  - M at position 4 (to confirm if secret has multiple Ms)
- If correct, game ends. If incorrect, feedback on G and extra M provides critical information to distinguish between MUMMY/JUMBY next.

We should avoid letters that we now know are not in the word.\n\n Common letters in English 5-letter words that are not in the set {C, R, A, T, E} include:\n   S, L, N, I, O, U, D, G, H, K, M, P, B, V, Y, W, F, J, Z, etc.\n\n Since the previous word had no matches, we want to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\n A good second guess might be words that include letters like S, L, N, O, I.\n\n Example: ""SPOIL"", ""LIONS"", ""NOISE"", etc.\n\n However, note that we must avoid the excluded letters.\n\n Let\'s generate a word that uses common letters not yet tried.\n\n Consider ""S"", ""L"", ""N"", ""O"", ""I"" — these are very common.\n\n A candidate word: ""SOLID"" — but D might not be as common? Alternatively, ""LINKS"" or ""POUND"".\n\n We also want to maximize the chance of getting positional information.\n\n Another idea: ""HOIST"" — but this has H, O, I, S, T. However, T was already excluded? Wait, T was in crate and was excluded. So we cannot use T.\n\n We must avoid T because the feedback for crate had T as ""x"".\n\n Therefore, we need a word without C, R, A, T, E.\n\n Let me propose ""SPOIL"":\n   S, P, O, I, L — none of these are in the excluded set.\n\n Alternatively, ""NOISY"" — N, O, I, S, Y.\n\n But I think ""SPOIL"" is reasonable.\n\n However, we have no information yet. Another option: ""SHOWN"" — S, H, O, W, N.\n\n To cover more common letters, consider ""SLIMY"" or ""PIOUS"".\n\n I\'ll go with ""SLIPY"" — but that\'s not a word? We need a valid word.\n\n Let me try: ""SPOIL"" is valid.\n\n Another common second guess in Wordle after excluding a bunch of letters is using the word ""POUND"".\n\n Since A, E, I, O, U are vowels, but we know A and E are out, so we should include O and I? And maybe U.\n\n So ""POUND"" — P, O, U, N, D — that avoids the excluded letters.\n\n However, note that ""crate"" used E and A, so the secret word must use other vowels, likely O, I, U, or sometimes Y.\n\n We have two options:\n\n Option 1: ""SPOIL"": S, P, O, I, L\n Option 2: ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D\n\n Let\'s compare:\n\n ""SPOIL"" has S, P, O, I, L — these are all relatively common. S, L, O are very common.\n ""POUND"" has P, O, U, N, D — U is less common? But N is common.\n\n Alternatively, ""LIONS"" — L, I, O, N, S — that has S, L, O, I, N. That also covers many common letters.\n\n I think ""LIONS"" might be better because it includes both L, I, O, N, S — which are all common.\n\n But note: ""LIONS"" is a valid word.\n\n So I\'ll choose ""LIONS"": \n   Letters: L, I, O, N, S — all not previously excluded.\n\n This will test:\n   L, I, O, N, S — which are common.\n\n Then, based on the feedback, we can narrow down.\n\n Therefore, the guess is ""lions"".\n\n<guess>lions</guess>After the first guess ""crate"" revealed that none of the letters C, R, A, T, or E appear in the secret word, my approach for the second guess focuses on:\n1.

Actually, PUDGY has P, U, D, G, Y -> distinct.\n\n But note: in FUDGY and PUDGY, we have U, D, G, Y in common, and either F or P.\n\n We also have BUMPY: B, U, M, P, Y -> distinct.\n\n Since we have no information, we want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\n Among the available letters, common ones in English 5-letter words are:\n   B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, Y.\n\n We don\'t have H, K, W in the words above? \n\n Let me try to find a word that includes H or K or W.\n\n For example:\n   ""WHACK"" - W, H, A, C, K -> A and C excluded.\n   ""MUCKY"" - M, U, C, K, Y -> C excluded.\n   ""HUMAN"" - H, U, M, A, N -> A and N excluded.\n\n It\'s hard to include H, K, W without using excluded letters.\n\n Another word: ""DOWRY"" - D, O, W, R, Y -> O and R excluded.\n\n ""HOWDY"" - H, O, W, D, Y -> O excluded.\n\n ""WACKY"" - W, A, C, K, Y -> A and C excluded.\n\n So, we might not be able to include W, H, K easily without repetition or using excluded letters.\n\n Therefore, we can choose one of the words we have.\n\n Let\'s choose ""DUMPY"" because it uses M and P, which are common, and Y which is sometimes a vowel.\n\n Alternatively, ""FUDGY"" uses F and G, which are also common.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We need to get as much information as possible.\n\n I think ""DUMPY"" is a good choice.\n\n However, let me check if there\'s a word that uses more common letters. The most common letters left are: D, M, P, B, F, G, U, Y.\n\n We can try to form a word with B, D, F, G, M, P, U, Y.\n\n Since we can only use 5, we have to pick 5.\n\n Another word: ""GUMPY"" - not a word.\n\n ""BUDGY"" - not a word.\n\n ""DUMPY"" seems fine.\n\n I\'ll go with ""DUMPY"".\n\n<guess>dumpy</guess>After two guesses with all letters incorrect (CRATE and LIONS), the secret word contains none of these 10 letters: **C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S**. \n\nFor the third guess, I need to:\n1. **Avoid all excluded letters** above\n2. **Test new high-frequency consonants and vowels** from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y\n3. **Maximize letter coverage** with 5 distinct letters to gather new information\n\nAfter evaluating options like FUDGY (F,U,D,G,Y) and BUMPY (B,U,M,P,Y), I selected **DUMPY** because:\n- ✓ Uses 5 new common letters: **D, U, M, P, Y**\n- ✓ Avoids rare letters (J, Q, X, Z) and repeated characters\n- ✓ Tests U (vowel) and frequent consonants (D, M, P)\n- ✓ Valid English word (meaning gloomy/dim)\n\nThis guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities by checking a new set of letters.\n\n<guess>dumpy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: lions -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(x) O(x) N(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: dumpy -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(✓) M(✓) P(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from Guess 3: dumpy -> D(x), U(✓), M(✓), P(x), Y(✓)\n This means:\n   - U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since U is the second letter in ""dumpy"")\n   - M is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since M is the third letter in ""dumpy"")\n   - Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since Y is the fifth letter in ""dumpy"")\n   - D and P are not in the word.\n\n Additionally, from previous guesses, we know that the word does not contain:\n   C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S, D, P\n\n So, the excluded letters are: C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S, D, P\n\n The secret word must have:\n   Position 2: U\n   Position 3: M\n   Position 5: Y\n\n And we know positions 1 and 4 are letters that are not excluded and not U, M, Y.\n\n The current pattern is: _ U M _ Y\n\n We need to fill in the first and fourth positions with letters not in the excluded set and not D or P (which we now know are excluded).\n\n The total excluded letters so far: C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S,D,P\n\n The remaining letters (from the alphabet) are: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z\n\n But note that we must choose letters that form a valid English word.\n\n We also know that the word cannot contain any of the excluded letters, and we have constraints on positions 1 and 4.\n\n Let\'s think of words that fit the pattern: ? U M ? Y\n\n Possible words:\n   We need to try combinations for the first and fourth positions from the available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z\n\n Let me try to brainstorm:\n   BUMFY? Not a word.\n   FUMBY? Not a word.\n   GUMBY? Not a word (unless a proper noun?).\n   HUMBY? Not a word.\n   JUMBY? JUMBY is a word (a spirit in Caribbean folklore).\n   KUMBY? Not a word (like kumbaya? but kumbaya is longer).\n   QUM?Y? Q doesn\'t combine well.\n\n Another idea: \n   BUMPY? But P is excluded, and also we had P as \'x\' in dumpy.\n   Something else: \n   ""MUMMY"" -> M is already in position 3? But let\'s see: M,U,M,M,Y -> however, the pattern requires M at position 3, and U at 2, Y at 5. But the word ""mummy"" has U at position 2? Let\'s check:\n      Position1: M -> but we have position3 fixed as M. So in ""mummy"", the M is at position1 and 3,4. But we know that M is in the word and at position 3. So M at position 1 is allowed? The feedback said M is in the correct position at position 3, but it doesn\'t say anything about other Ms. However, note that in the guess ""dumpy"", we had M at position 3 and got a correct (✓), so if there were an M at position 1, we wouldn\'t have known because we didn\'t test an M at position 1.\n\n But wait, the feedback for dumpy was for the specific positions: \n   Position 1: D(x) -> so D is not in the word and also D is excluded.\n   Position 2: U(✓) -> U is correct and in position.\n   Position 3: M(✓) -> M is correct and in position.\n   Position 4: P(x) -> P is excluded.\n   Position 5: Y(✓) -> Y is correct and in position.\n\n So, the secret word has U at position 2, M at position 3, Y at position 5, and does not contain D or P.\n\n Now, considering M: we have M only at position 3? But if the word has another M, like at position 1, it might be possible. However, we haven\'t tested that.\n\n But let me list possible words:\n\n We have the pattern: ? U M ? Y\n\n The fourth letter cannot be P (excluded) or any of the other excluded ones.\n\n Let me try to think of valid words:\n\n   * HUMKY? Not a word.\n   * JUMBY: J U M B Y -> I think JUMBY is accepted in some dictionaries (as jumbie or jumby).\n   * BUMFY? Not a word.\n   * FUMFY? Not a word.\n   * GUMMY: G U M M Y -> has M at position 4? But we don\'t know if M is in the word more than once. Also, note that we have excluded P, but not M again. However, GUMMY: \n        G at position 1? Yes, and M at position 4? Then we have M at both position 3 and 4? That might be.\n\n   But in our pattern, position 4 must be filled. Let\'s check:\n        Position1: G\n        Position2: U (fixed)\n        Position3: M (fixed)\n        Position4: M -> this would be a repeated M? And then Y at position5.\n\n   So ""GUMMY"" is a word. And it fits the pattern.\n\n   Another: ""BUMMY"" is not a word.\n\n   Also: ""MUMMY"" would have M at position1 -> but we don\'t have M at position1 tested? However, the pattern requires position2: U, position3: M, so ""MUMMY"" wouldn\'t fit because position1 is M and position2 is U? Actually, ""MUMMY"" is M-U-M-M-Y -> so it has U at position2 and M at position3 and Y at position5. So ""MUMMY"" also fits the pattern.\n\n   But note: we have excluded the letter D and P, but not H or G. Also, in ""MUMMY"", the M at position1 might be acceptable? Because we haven\'t tested position1.\n\n   Other words:\n        ""BUMMY"" is not valid.\n        ""FUMMY"" is not valid.\n        ""HUMMY"" might be considered valid? But not a common word.\n\n   Also: ""JUMMY"" - not a word.\n\n   Let me check: \n        GUMMY and MUMMY are both valid.\n\n   However, note: in GUMMY, the fourth letter is M and fifth is Y. Similarly, MUMMY has M at position1 and M at position4.\n\n   Are there any other words?\n        ""VUMBY"" - not a word.\n        ""WUMBY"" - not a word.\n\n   So the candidates are:\n        GUMMY: G U M M Y\n        MUMMY: M U M M Y\n\n   But note: we don\'t know if there can be more than one M. The feedback only confirmed M at position3, but it might appear elsewhere.\n\n   We must also consider that in the word ""MUMMY"", we have M at position1. But we haven\'t ruled out M at other positions.\n\n   Another word: ""KUMYS"" but S is excluded, and also it ends with S, not Y? No, KUMYS is not common and ends with S.\n\n   How about ""SUMY""? But we have 5 letters: pattern is 5 letters. ""SUMY"" is 4 letters? No, we need 5.\n\n   So the main possibilities are GUMMY and MUMMY.\n\n   But wait, the feedback from Guess 3: dumpy -> we had M at position3, but if the word has M at position4, it wouldn\'t have been revealed because we didn\'t have M in position4. Similarly, for GUMMY, we are putting a G at position1 and M at position4.\n\n   However, note that in our third guess, we didn\'t test for G or M at other positions? But we tested D at position1 and got x, so position1 cannot be D. Similarly, P at position4 got x.\n\n   Now, we have two possibilities: GUMMY and MUMMY.\n\n   But also, note that we have excluded many letters. For position1, we have tried D (with dumpy) and got x, so position1 cannot be D. Also, from lions and crate, we know position1 is not C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S.\n\n   So for position1, we need a letter from the remaining ones: B,F,G,H,J,K,V,W,X,Y,Z? But Y is already at position5? And we know position1 is Y? Not necessarily, but Y could be in other positions? But note we have Y at position5 marked correct, so Y is fixed there.\n\n   So position1 cannot be Y? Well, we don\'t know for sure because a word could have multiple Ys? But we don\'t have information about that.\n\n   However, in the pattern, position5 is Y. So if we put Y at position1, that would be a different Y? But the word may or may not allow multiple Ys.\n\n   But let us consider: \n        For MUMMY: position1 is M -> which is allowed? Because M is in the word (we know M at position3) but having another M is not prohibited. The feedback doesn\'t say anything against multiple Ms.\n\n   Similarly, for GUMMY: position1 is G, which is not excluded? Because G is not in [C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S,D,P]. So G is available.\n\n   Now, how can we decide? Since we have two possibilities, we might need to choose a word that tests one of these.\n\n   But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since this is the fourth guess, and we have 6 total). We can guess one of them.\n\n   Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses one of the possibilities or a different word that might cover both scenarios.\n\n   However, we can also note:\n\n   - If the word is ""MUMMY"", then position1 must be M. \n   - If the word is ""GUMMY"", then position1 must be G and position4 must be M.\n\n   But are there other words? \n\n   Let me search: are there any other words that fit ? U M ? Y ?\n\n   We must consider the available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z\n\n   So:\n        ? U M [B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z] Y\n\n   We need the whole word to be valid.\n\n   So far, we have:\n        M U M M Y -> MUMMY (M at both 1 and 4)\n        G U M M Y -> GUMMY (G at 1, M at 4)\n        H U M M Y -> HUMMY? Not a word.\n        B U M M Y -> BUMMY? Not a word.\n\n   Also, with the fourth letter not M:\n        For example: \n           B U M B Y -> BUMBY? Not a word.\n           F U M B Y -> FUMBY? Not a word.\n           H U M B Y -> HUMBY? Not a word.\n           J U M B Y -> JUMBY? We considered JUMBY earlier and it might be acceptable? But note JUMBY is spelled J-U-M-B-Y, so it would work: \n                Position1: J, position2: U, position3: M, position4: B, position5: Y.\n\n           And JUMBY is a word (variant of jumbie).\n\n        Similarly:\n           K U M B Y? Not a word.\n           V U M B Y? Not a word.\n\n        Another: W U M B Y -> not a word.\n\n        So JUMBY is a candidate.\n\n   Also, what about other letters? For example:\n        F U M F Y -> not a word? And F repeated.\n\n   So we have at least three candidates:\n      MUMMY, GUMMY, JUMBY\n\n   Now, we need to choose one that will help us disambiguate.\n\n   We have feedback that the word has U, M, Y at positions 2,3,5. And we know the letters D and P are not in the word.\n\n   Now, for the next guess, since we have three possibilities and we must guess one, we might choose the one that tests a letter we haven\'t tried.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests the first letter more broadly.\n\n   But note: we have only 4 more tries? Actually, we are on the fourth guess. So we can try one of these.\n\n   To maximize information, we might choose a word that includes letters we haven\'t tried yet.\n\n   Letters we have tried: \n      C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S,D,U,M,P,Y -> and U,M,Y are in the word.\n\n   We haven\'t tried: B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z.\n\n   If we guess MUMMY, note that it only uses M,U,Y and one new letter: M (but we already have M). Actually, no new letters? Because the new M is at position1, but we already know M is in the word? It doesn\'t test a new letter.\n\n   Similarly, GUMMY tests G and M (already known?) and the M again.\n\n   But JUMBY tests J (which is uncommon) and B, which we haven\'t tested. But if we guess JUMBY and it\'s wrong, we have more information?\n\n   Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t assume the fourth letter is M. Because we don\'t know about position4.\n\n   How about if we don\'t fix it to M? We could try a word that has a different letter at position4? For example, JUMBY (with B at position4) or perhaps another word.\n\n   The word ""FUM Y"" as in ""FUMAY""? Not a word.\n\n   Another word: ""HUYMY"" - not a word.\n\n   So JUMBY might be our only other candidate.\n\n   Now, let me confirm:\n\n   - MUMMY: accepted word\n   - GUMMY: accepted word\n   - JUMBY: recognized as a variant of jumbie\n\n   So we have three possibilities.\n\n   Now, to choose one, we might pick the one that tests a letter that appears in other possible words? But there are only three.\n\n   Alternatively, we can pick one that uses common letters? But among B, G, J, which is more common? G is more common, then B, then J.\n\n   But note: the word might be GUMMY, which uses G. Or MUMMY, which uses M (already confirmed). Or JUMBY, which uses J and B.\n\n   Since we don\'t have information about G or B, we might prefer to test a word that includes G or B.\n\n   We could guess GUMMY? Because if it\'s GUMMY, we get it right. If not, then feedback might tell us about the first letter.\n\n   Alternatively, we could guess a word that has both G and B? But in the pattern ? U M ? Y, we cannot have both G and B because they must occupy position1 and position4.\n\n   Example: we cannot have G at position1 and B at position4 because then we get ""GUMMY"" replaced by ""GUMBY""? Not a word.\n\n   So we cannot do that.\n\n   Since we are forced to pick one pattern, let\'s choose GUMMY as our next guess because G is a common letter and might appear in other words? But if we are wrong, we can infer.\n\n   Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not one of these three but tests several possibilities? How? We don\'t know a word that would.\n\n   Another idea: guess a word that has a different structure? But we must follow the pattern because we know positions 2,3,5 are fixed.\n\n   We cannot change the U, M, Y.\n\n   So we must have U at2, M at3, Y at5.\n\n   Therefore, our guess must be of the form XUMZY, where X and Z are letters from the available set.\n\n   So we have fixed positions.\n\n   We are left to guess positions 1 and 4.\n\n   Given that, we should choose a guess that will address multiple possibilities.\n\n   Unfortunately, since we have very few letters left, we might just have to try one and then deduce.\n\n   Let me assign:\n\n   Position1: can be one of B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z\n   Position4: can be one of B,F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z\n\n   And the word must be valid.\n\n   We found:\n      Position4 = M: leads to words with position1 being G, M, H? -> GUMMY, MUMMY, but HUMMY not a word? So only GUMMY and MUMMY.\n      Position4 = B: leads to JUMBY (if we accept it) and no other we found.\n\n   Also, position4 = K: we could have ""KUMKY""? No, not a word.\n\n   So the only known words are those three.\n\n   Therefore, we should guess GUMMY? Because it tests G at position1 and M at position4.\n\n   If we guess GUMMY:\n        If it is correct: we win.\n        If not, feedback will show:\n            Position1: G -> if it is x, then we know position1 is not G? Then the word would be MUMMY? But note MUMMY has position1=M. \n            Position4: M -> if it is not in the word? But wait, we already have M at position3. How would M at position4 be marked?\n\n        Let\'s simulate:\n\n        Case 1: the word is MUMMY.\n          Guess: GUMMY -> G (position1): since MUMMY has M at position1, and G is not in MUMMY? So G would be x.\n          Position4: M -> but MUMMY has M at position4? But note: the M at position4 is already accounted for? Wait, MUMMY has three Ms: at positions1,3,4. We know about the M at position3 already.\n\n          For feedback: \n            Position1: G vs M -> different, so x (since we don\'t have a G in MUMMY)\n            Position2: U vs U -> ✓\n            Position3: M vs M -> ✓\n            Position4: M vs M -> ✓? But wait, in MUMMY, there are two Ms besides the one at position3? Actually, the M at position4 is present? So if we have MUMMY, then we have Ms at positions3 and4? So in GUMMY, position4 is M and MUMMY has M at position4? So it\'s the same. So in feedback, position4 would be ✓? Also, we have an extra M at position1? But in GUMMY we don\'t have M at position1? \n\n          Actually, the feedback should be:\n\n            Position1: G? MUMMY has M at position1 -> G is not M and MUMMY doesn\'t have G? So ✓ should be x.\n            Position2: U matches -> ✓\n            Position3: M matches -> ✓\n            Position4: M matches? Yes -> ✓\n            Position5: Y matches -> ✓\n\n          So the feedback would be: G(x), U(✓), M(✓), M(✓), Y(✓)\n\n          But wait: we have used two Ms? The secret word MUMMY has three Ms? How would the feedback handle repeated letters?\n\n          In Wordle, the feedback handles repeated letters carefully: each letter in the guess is matched against the word, giving priority to exact positions, and then any remaining are marked as in word but wrong position? But note: if a letter appears multiple times, it can get multiple matches? Or is it counted as many as in the secret word?\n\n          In standard Wordle, feedback counts each occurrence independently. Since MUMMY has three Ms, and GUMMY has two Ms: \n            Position3: M matched exactly -> uses one occurrence.\n            Position4: M matched exactly -> uses another occurrence.\n            Then, the M in the secret word at position1 remains? But GUMMY doesn\'t have an M in position1? So the remaining M is unmatched? But GUMMY has M only at positions3 and4? Not at position1.\n\n          However, in the guess GUMMY, we are not claiming a letter M at position1? The M in GUMMY is only at positions3 and4? So the M at position1 in MUMMY would not be matched? But we don\'t have to worry about position1 in terms of M? Because we guessed G at position1.\n\n          Therefore, feedback only looks at the position:\n\n            Position1: G (incorrect) -> x\n            Position2: U correct -> ✓\n            Position3: M correct -> ✓\n            Position4: M is correct? Yes, MUMMY has M at position4 -> ✓\n            Position5: Y correct -> ✓\n\n          Then, what about the extra M? We don\'t have a M in GUMMY at position1? So no other M. The secret word has one more M? But we didn\'t guess it? So it doesn\'t show up? It would only mark the guessed letters.\n\n          Therefore, feedback: x, ✓, ✓, ✓, ✓\n\n          This wouldn\'t let us know that the secret word has an M at position1? But we would then know that the first letter must be something else? And that the fourth letter is M. But we would have three ✓ and one x? Then next guess we can try MUMMY?\n\n          Alternatively, if we guess MUMMY and the secret word is GUMMY?\n\n          For MUMMY vs GUMMY:\n\n            Position1: M vs G -> M is not G and GUMMY has M? Where? Position4? But in GUMMY, the M is at position3 and4? So:\n\n              Position1: M (guess) vs G (secret) -> is M in GUMMY? Yes, at positions 3 and 4. But since it\'s not at position1, it would mark:\n\n                  For position1: M is not in the correct position? But M is in GUMMY? So it would be marked as ""-"" for being in the word but wrong position? \n\n          Let\'s follow the rules:\n\n            The secret word GUMMY: positions: G, U, M, M, Y.\n            Guess: M U M M Y\n\n            Position1: M -> GUMMY has M? Yes, but not at position1? So it should be ""-"" (wrong position)? \n            Position2: U -> matches -> ✓\n            Position3: M -> matches -> ✓\n            Position4: M -> matches -> ✓\n            Position5: Y -> matches -> ✓\n\n            So feedback: M(-), U(✓), M(✓), M(✓), Y(✓)\n\n          This tells us that M is in the word but wrong position? However, we already fixed M at position3 and4? So we have a contradiction? Because in our pattern, position3 and4 are M? And we get ✓ at 3 and 4? Then where is the extra M? Why position1 gets ""-"" meaning it\'s present elsewhere? But elsewhere includes position3 and4? That might confuse.\n\n          In fact, the feedback system counts each occurrence: GUMMY has two Ms? We guess three Ms? Only two are correct? How?\n\n          Actually, GUMMY has two Ms: one at position3 and one at position4? So the guess ""MUMMY"" has three Ms: position1,3,4.\n\n          In the guess:\n            Position1: M -> GUMMY has M? Yes, but not at position1? So one of the Ms in the secret is assigned to this? Or one of the Ms is assigned to the exact matches?\n\n          Typical Wordle feedback assigns green (correct) first, then yellow for any unmatched letters in the word.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            1. Mark exact matches: position2: U, position3: M, position4: M, position5: Y -> four ✓.\n            2. For any non-exact, check if the letter appears: position1: M -> is there an M in the secret that isn\'t matched? But we already matched both Ms in the secret? So no, position1 should be x? \n\n          Therefore, the feedback for GUMMY against the guess MUMMY would be:\n            Position1: M -> x (because both Ms in GUMMY are already matched at positions3 and4)\n            Position2: ✓\n            Position3: ✓\n            Position4: ✓\n            Position5: ✓\n\n          So it would be M(x), U(✓), M(✓), M(✓), Y(✓)\n\n          Similarly, if we guess JUMBY against MUMMY:\n\n            Position1: J -> x (if secret is MUMMY, J is not present)\n            Position2: U -> ✓\n            Position3: M -> ✓\n            Position4: B -> vs M? Is B in the word? If secret is MUMMY, no -> x\n            Position5: Y -> ✓\n            So feedback: J(x), U(✓), M(✓), B(x), Y(✓) -> x,✓,✓,x,✓\n\n   Given that, we might choose JUMBY? Because it tests two new letters: J and B? And we can get more information.\n\n   But note: if JUMBY is the word, we get everything correct.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose MUMMY? Because M is already confirmed? But not at position1.\n\n   Actually, we have no information about position1 and position4? So guessing MUMMY may be premature.\n\n   We are allowed to try words that help disambiguate.\n\n   Since we have three words:\n\n     Option1: GUMMY -> has letters G, U, M, M, Y -> and we know U, M, Y for sure? But G is the unknown.\n     Option2: MUMMY -> has M, U, M, M, Y -> M at position1 is the unknown? But already we have M.\n     Option3: JUMBY -> has J, U, M, B, Y -> J and B are unknowns.\n\n   If we guess JUMBY:\n\n        If the secret is GUMMY: \n          Guess: J U M B Y vs G U M M Y \n          Position1: J vs G -> not match, and J is not in GUMMY -> J(x)\n          Position2: U ✓\n          Position3: M ✓\n          Position4: B vs M -> different, and B not in GUMMY -> B(x)\n          Position5: Y ✓\n          And note: the M we have at position3 matches, but GUMMY has another M at position4? We don\'t have a B? So feedback: J(x) U(✓) M(✓) B(x) Y(✓)\n\n        This doesn\'t reveal the M at position4? We would know that position4 is not B.\n\n        But we would know that the secret has no J, no B? So then we might go to GUMMY in the next guess? But we didn\'t get information about the fourth letter?\n\n        Alternatively, if the secret is GUMMY, we would have no knowledge that the fourth letter is M? Because in our guess we used B at position4? So we didn\'t test M at position4.\n\n        Then next guess we might try GUMMY and win? Or try to test M?\n\n   Given these, I think it\'s better to guess GUMMY because it tests a common letter G at position1 and also tests if M is at position4? If position4 marks M as correct? Then we know.\n\n   So I\'ll go with GUMMY.\n\n   If the secret is GUMMY, we win.\n\n   If not, then we get feedback:\n\n        Case secret is MUMMY: \n           Guess GUMMY: \n                Position1: G -> x (not in secret MUMMY? MUMMY has no G) \n                Position2: U ✓\n                Position3: M ✓\n                Position4: M ✓ (because MUMMY has M at position4)\n                Position5: Y ✓\n           So feedback: G(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(✓) Y(✓)\n\n        Then we know position1 must be something else? The only remaining candidate for position1 (if secret is MUMMY) is M? But we already have M? And we know that the only other word is MUMMY? So we would guess MUMMY next.\n\n        Case secret is JUMBY:\n           Guess GUMMY:\n                Position1: G vs J -> G not in secret? Since JUMBY uses J,U,M,B,Y? So G not present? x\n                Position2: U ✓\n                Position3: M ✓\n                Position4: M vs B -> M not in secret? Well, secret has only one M at position3, and we matched it? So M at position4 is not present? So x\n                Position5: Y ✓\n           Feedback: G(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(x) Y(✓)\n\n        Then we know the fourth letter is not M? So among the candidates, that leaves JUMBY? So next guess: JUMBY wins.\n\n   Similarly, if we guess GUMMY and get feedback with M at position4 correct, then we know the word is either GUMMY (if we win) or MUMMY (if we still have to win)? And we can distinguish? \n\n   Therefore, we should guess GUMMY.\n\n<guess>gummy</guess>Based on previous feedback:\n- Secret word excludes letters: C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S, D, P\n- Must contain U at position 2, M at position 3, and Y at position 5\n- Pattern: _ U M _ Y\n\nPossible words fitting the pattern:\n- **GUMMY**: Valid English word (chewy candy texture)\n- **MUMMY**: Valid English word (preserved corpse)\n- **JUMBY**: Valid English word (Caribbean folklore spirit)\n\nStrategic choice for this guess:\n- Select **GUMMY** to test:\n  - G at position 1 (previously untested common consonant)\n  - M at position 4 (to confirm if secret has multiple Ms)\n- If correct, game ends.

We have received feedback for Guess 4: gummy -> G(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(✓) Y(✓)

Interpretation:
- Position 2: U is correct (as we knew)
- Position 3: M is correct (as we knew)
- Position 5: Y is correct (as we knew)
- Position 4: M is correct! This is new information; so the fourth letter is M.
- Position 1: G is incorrect (x), and earlier we knew D was also incorrect.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: ? U M M Y

We confirmed:
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: M
  Position 4: M
  Position 5: Y

We need to determine position 1.

From previous feedback, we know the letter at position 1 cannot be:
  From Guess 1: C, R, A, T, E
  From Guess 2: L, I, O, N, S
  From Guess 3: D, P
  From Guess 4: G

Also, we know the secret word does not contain any of these excluded letters.

The excluded letters are: C, R, A, T, E, L, I, O, N, S, D, P, G

Available letters for position 1: B, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

We must choose a valid English word _ U M M Y (so the first letter must complete the word).

The word must be a 5-letter English word with the pattern ?UMMY.

Possible words:
- BUMMY? Not a common word (slang for stomach?)
- HUMMY? Also not standard.
- JUMMY? Not recognized.
- KUMMY? No.
- MUMMY: But that would be M U M M Y -> but note we already tried Gummy? And Mummy would have M at position 1.

Why didn't we try MUMMY earlier? Because we were testing Gummy to cover multiple cases.

But now, after the feedback:
- We know position 4 is M (so the word is - U M M Y).
- And position 1 is not G.

Now, what about MUMMY? 
- It has M at position 1? We have not excluded M? Even though we know M is in the word (at position 3), it could appear multiple times.

Is ""MUMMY"" a valid word? Yes.

Let's check:
  Position 1: M -> in MUMMY: M U M M Y -> M at position 1.
  Is M excluded? No, only excluded letters are C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S,D,P,G.

Therefore, MUMMY is a candidate.

Other possibilities?
  We must use available letters at position 1: B, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But no other common words match ?UMMY.

Let's confirm all:
  BUMMY: Not a standard English word (might be slang, but not listed in standard dictionaries)
  FUMMY: Not a word.
  HUMMY: Not a standard word.
  JUMMY: Not a word.
  KUMMY: No.
  QUMMY? No.
  etc.

Therefore, the only common word left is MUMMY.

So we guess MUMMY.

In our fourth guess we guessed GUMMY and it gave us feedback: 
  G(x), U(✓), M(✓), M(✓), Y(✓)

This indicates that the word is GUMMY without the G? But no, we know the secret word must have U, M, M, Y at positions 2,3,4,5. So the first letter is the only unknown.

The word is MUMMY? Then we should have guessed that.

So now, we guess MUMMY.

After Guess 4 (gummy) revealed:
- U, M, M, Y confirmed at positions 2,3,4,5 → Pattern: _ U M M Y
- G eliminated (G(x)) along with previously excluded letters (C,R,A,T,E,L,I,O,N,S,D,P)
- Position 1 requires a letter from remaining: B,F,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z

**Analysis:**
- MUMMY is the only common English word fitting the pattern ?UMMY:
  - Valid word: Preserved body (accepted in Wordle)
  - Uses M at position 1 (M not excluded; possible even with M at position 3)
- No other valid words match (e.g., BUMMY/HUMMY/JUMMY not recognized)

Given only 2 guesses left, MUMMY is the logical choice based on feedback and pattern constraints.
