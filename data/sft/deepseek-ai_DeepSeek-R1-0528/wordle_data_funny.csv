We are starting the game. For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word.
 Since there's no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information gained.
 Common vowels and consonants are helpful. Words like 'SLATE', 'CRANE', 'ROUSE', etc., are often good starters.

 However, I recall that 'RAISE' is a popular starter because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (R, S). 
 Alternatively, 'SLATE' has S, L, A, T, E which covers multiple common letters.

 But let me consider a word that has a good distribution of common letters.

 Among the top choices for Wordle starters, 'CRATE' is also good: C, R, A, T, E.

 I think I'll go with 'RAISE' because it has the letters R, A, I, S, E which are all quite common.

 Therefore, my first guess will be: RAISE

 But note: the problem says to return in the format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>

For the first guess without any prior feedback, I chose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information.

We are at the beginning of the game. The user's first guess was ""guessed-word"", but that is not a 5-letter word. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the previous response.

 Let me clarify: The user asked for the first guess, and in my previous response, I intended to guess ""RAISE"", but I see that I wrote ""guessed-word"" in the response format. That was a mistake.

 Actually, looking back at the previous response, I said:
   ""Therefore, my first guess will be: RAISE""

 But then in the response format, I wrote: <guess>guessed-word</guess>

 That was incorrect. I should have written: <guess>RAISE</guess>

 However, the user is now providing feedback based on that incorrect guess? The feedback says: 
   ""Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.""

 So, because ""guessed-word"" is not a 5-letter word, it's invalid.

 Now the user is asking for a new 5-letter word guess. Since the first guess was invalid, we are still at the first guess.

 I need to make a valid first guess.

 Let me choose a valid 5-letter word. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as I intended.

 But note: the user might have meant that the previous response was invalid, so we are starting over.

 Therefore, I will make a new first guess: ""RAISE""

 However, to be safe, I can choose a different word. But ""RAISE"" is a good starter.

 Alternatively, I can use ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". Let me pick ""CRANE"" this time to avoid confusion.

 Why ""CRANE""? 
   - It has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
   - It covers three vowels (A, E) and two consonants (C, R, N).

 So, I'll guess ""CRANE"".

 But note: the user might be expecting a correction. Since the first attempt was invalid, I'll provide a valid 5-letter word.

Important: The game requires a valid 5-letter English word. I must ensure my guess meets this criterion.

For an optimal first guess, I'll select a word that:
- Uses common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
- Has all distinct letters to maximize information
- Is a recognized English word

Strong candidates include:
- ""CRANE"": Contains C, R, A, N, E → covers 3 vowels and 2 consonants
- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E → similarly effective
- Other common starters: ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", ""ADIEU""

After reevaluating, I'll choose **""CRANE""** because:
- It has the statistically beneficial letters C, R, A, N, E
- It avoids repeating previous invalid responses
- It's frequently recommended as an optimal Wordle opener

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,funny,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word.
 Since there's no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information gained.
 Common vowels and consonants are helpful. Words like 'SLATE', 'CRANE', 'ROUSE', etc., are often good starters.

 However, I recall that 'RAISE' is a popular starter because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (R, S). 
 Alternatively, 'SLATE' has S, L, A, T, E which covers multiple common letters.

 But let me consider a word that has a good distribution of common letters.

 Among the top choices for Wordle starters, 'CRATE' is also good: C, R, A, T, E.

 I think I'll go with 'RAISE' because it has the letters R, A, I, S, E which are all quite common.

 Therefore, my first guess will be: RAISE

 But note: the problem says to return in the format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>For the first guess without any prior feedback, I chose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information. ""RAISE"" contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps identify recurring letters and positions efficiently. This word is also a valid English word frequently used as a starting guess in similar games.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are at the beginning of the game. The user's first guess was ""guessed-word"", but that is not a 5-letter word. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the previous response.

 Let me clarify: The user asked for the first guess, and in my previous response, I intended to guess ""RAISE"", but I see that I wrote ""guessed-word"" in the response format. That was a mistake.

 Actually, looking back at the previous response, I said:
   ""Therefore, my first guess will be: RAISE""

 But then in the response format, I wrote: <guess>guessed-word</guess>

 That was incorrect. I should have written: <guess>RAISE</guess>

 However, the user is now providing feedback based on that incorrect guess? The feedback says: 
   ""Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.""

 So, because ""guessed-word"" is not a 5-letter word, it's invalid.

 Now the user is asking for a new 5-letter word guess. Since the first guess was invalid, we are still at the first guess.

 I need to make a valid first guess.

 Let me choose a valid 5-letter word. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as I intended.

 But note: the user might have meant that the previous response was invalid, so we are starting over.

 Therefore, I will make a new first guess: ""RAISE""

 However, to be safe, I can choose a different word. But ""RAISE"" is a good starter.

 Alternatively, I can use ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". Let me pick ""CRANE"" this time to avoid confusion.

 Why ""CRANE""? 
   - It has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
   - It covers three vowels (A, E) and two consonants (C, R, N).

 So, I'll guess ""CRANE"".

 But note: the user might be expecting a correction. Since the first attempt was invalid, I'll provide a valid 5-letter word.

 Let me output: <guess>CRANE</guess><thinking>
I need to make a valid 5-letter word guess since the previous attempt (""guessed-word"") was invalid. For an optimal first guess, I should choose a word with common letters to maximize information. Good starter words typically include frequent vowels and consonants. 

After considering options like ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) and ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E), I'll choose **""RAISE""** because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)
- It covers five distinct letters to test multiple positions
- It's a statistically strong opener in word games

This guess will provide clear feedback about which letters are present and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

<｜Assistant｜>We've had two consecutive invalid guesses (""guessed-word"" both times) because they weren't 5-letter words. Now I need to provide a valid 5-letter word for the first real guess.

Important: The game requires a valid 5-letter English word. I must ensure my guess meets this criterion.

For an optimal first guess, I'll select a word that:
- Uses common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
- Has all distinct letters to maximize information
- Is a recognized English word

Strong candidates include:
- ""CRANE"": Contains C, R, A, N, E → covers 3 vowels and 2 consonants
- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E → similarly effective
- Other common starters: ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", ""ADIEU""

After reevaluating, I'll choose **""CRANE""** because:
- It has the statistically beneficial letters C, R, A, N, E
- It avoids repeating previous invalid responses
- It's frequently recommended as an optimal Wordle opener

Let's confirm it's 5 letters: C-R-A-N-E → yes.<thinking>
The previous guesses (""guessed-word"") were invalid as they were not 5-letter words. For a valid first guess, I need a strategic 5-letter English word to maximize information gain. 

I'll choose **""CRANE""** because:

We have feedback from Guess 3: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
 This means:
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (specifically, the 4th letter, since N is the 4th letter in CRANE).
   - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has the letter N in the 4th position, and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
   - Has N in the 4th position.
   - Does not use C, R, A, E (since they are absent).
   - Uses other letters to try to find which letters are present.

 Since we know the 4th letter is N, we can fix that.

 Let me denote the word as: _ _ _ N _

 We know the word does not contain: C, R, A, E.

 We need to choose a word that has N in the 4th position and uses other common letters.

 Common consonants left: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.
 Vowels left: O, I, U (but note we have no vowels so far, so we must include some to cover possibilities).

 Since we have no vowels known, and A and E are out, we should try a word with O or I or U.

 Let's think of words that have N in the 4th position.

 Example: 
   - LION? -> L I O N (but then we need a 5th letter, and LION is 4 letters). So not 5.
   - We need 5-letter words.

 Let me list some 5-letter words with N in the 4th position and without C, R, A, E.

 Possibilities: 
   - POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> 4th is N. But does it have forbidden letters? P, O, I, N, T. None of C,R,A,E. So valid.
   - JOINT: J-O-I-N-T -> same, but J is less common.
   - MOUNT: M-O-U-N-T -> M, O, U, N, T -> no C,R,A,E.
   - COUNT: but C is forbidden -> invalid.
   - FOUND: F-O-U-N-D -> F is allowed, but D is allowed. But we have U and O.

 However, we don't know if O, I, U are in the word. We need to test common letters.

 Since we have limited information, we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 We also have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.

 Let me think of a word that has N in the 4th position and includes common letters we haven't tried.

 We haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, etc.

 One good candidate: POINT -> letters: P, O, I, N, T. 
   - P, O, I, T are new and common.

 Another candidate: JOINT -> but J is less common, so POINT is better.

 Another: MOUNT -> M, O, U, N, T -> we get to test M, O, U, T.

 But note: we already know N is in the 4th position, so we don't need to test N again? Actually, we are using it to fix the position.

 However, we are allowed to reuse a known correct letter in the same position to help with other letters.

 But in this case, we must have N in the 4th position.

 Another candidate: SHUNT -> S, H, U, N, T -> tests S, H, U, T.

 But H is less common than O or I.

 Another: BLUNT -> B, L, U, N, T -> tests B, L, U, T.

 But we don't know if B or L are in the word.

 Considering maximizing information, we want to test as many common letters as possible.

 The most common letters in English (without C, R, A, E) are: S, T, L, O, I, N (but N we already know).

 So POINT: P, O, I, T -> and P is also common.

 Alternatively, we could try a word with S and T, like STOMP? But then N is not in the 4th position. We must have N in the 4th.

 So we need a word that ends with ""N"" as the 4th, so the pattern is ???N?.

 Words: 
   - ...N. -> so the last letter can be any letter.

 Let me think of common words: 
   - POINT: P O I N T -> 4th is N, 5th is T.
   - JOINT: J O I N T
   - MOUNT: M O U N T
   - FOUND: but F O U N D -> but we have F and D, and U. But F and D are less common? 
   - BOUND: B O U N D -> same.

 But note: we also want to avoid using too many vowels if we are not sure, but we need to test vowels.

 Since we have no vowels confirmed (only that A and E are absent), we should test O and I or O and U.

 POINT tests O and I.

 MOUNT tests O and U.

 Which one? Both are good. I'll go with POINT because I is more common than U.

 But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

 However, since we are in the second real guess (first valid one was CRANE, now this is the second), we can try POINT.

 But wait: we have already used the letter N in CRANE and it was correct, so we are keeping it. But in POINT, we are using N again in the same position, which is good.

 So let's guess POINT.

 However, we must ensure we don't use any forbidden letters: C, R, A, E. POINT has none of these.

 Therefore, I'll guess POINT.

 But let me double-check: 
   P: not forbidden
   O: not forbidden
   I: not forbidden
   N: we know is in the word (and in the correct position)
   T: not forbidden

 So it's safe.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has S, because S is very common. For example, STINT: S T I N T -> but T is repeated? And we don't know if T is in the word. Also, STINT has two T's, which might not be efficient if the word doesn't have T.

 Another: POINT seems fine.

 Or JOINTS? But that's 6 letters.

 We must stick to 5 letters.

 Another candidate: SPOON? But O is repeated and the 4th letter is O, not N. So no.

 We must have N in the 4th.

 So I think POINT is a good choice.

 Let me go with POINT.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the last guess ""CRANE"":
- **N is correct and in the right position (4th letter)**.
- **C, R, A, E are absent** from the secret word.

### Key Constraints:
- The 4th letter must be **N**.
- The word **cannot contain C, R, A, or E**.
- We need to test new common letters (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, P) to gather more information.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Choose a word with **N in the 4th position** and **new high-frequency letters**.
- Prioritize testing vowels (O, I, U) since no vowels are confirmed yet (A/E are ruled out).
- Avoid reused letters (C, R, A, E) and focus on unexplored consonants like T, S, P.

### Selected Guess: **POINT**
- **P**: New consonant (common, untested).
- **O, I**: New vowels (critical to test, as no vowels are confirmed).
- **N**: Fixed in the 4th position (known from feedback).
- **T**: New consonant (high frequency).
- **All letters are distinct** and valid (no C, R, A, E).

This guess efficiently tests 4 new letters while respecting the constraints. If O or I appear in the feedback, it will reveal vowel positions; if absent, we eliminate them.

- **C, R, A, E are absent** from the secret word.

### Key Constraints:
- The 4th letter must be **N**.
- The word **cannot contain C, R, A, or E**.
- We need to test new common letters (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, P) to gather more information.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Choose a word with **N in the 4th position** and **new high-frequency letters**.
- Prioritize testing vowels (O, I, U) since no vowels are confirmed yet (A/E are ruled out).
- Avoid reused letters (C, R, A, E) and focus on unexplored consonants like T, S, P.

### Selected Guess: **POINT**
- **P**: New consonant (common, untested).
- **O, I**: New vowels (critical to test, as no vowels are confirmed).
- **N**: Fixed in the 4th position (known from feedback).
- **T**: New consonant (high frequency).
- **All letters are distinct** and valid (no C, R, A, E).

This guess efficiently tests 4 new letters while respecting the constraints. If O or I appear in the feedback, it will reveal vowel positions; if absent, we eliminate them.",Guess 4: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,funny,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word.
 Since there's no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information gained.
 Common vowels and consonants are helpful. Words like 'SLATE', 'CRANE', 'ROUSE', etc., are often good starters.

 However, I recall that 'RAISE' is a popular starter because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (R, S). 
 Alternatively, 'SLATE' has S, L, A, T, E which covers multiple common letters.

 But let me consider a word that has a good distribution of common letters.

 Among the top choices for Wordle starters, 'CRATE' is also good: C, R, A, T, E.

 I think I'll go with 'RAISE' because it has the letters R, A, I, S, E which are all quite common.

 Therefore, my first guess will be: RAISE

 But note: the problem says to return in the format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>For the first guess without any prior feedback, I chose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information. ""RAISE"" contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps identify recurring letters and positions efficiently. This word is also a valid English word frequently used as a starting guess in similar games.

<guess>guessed-word</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are at the beginning of the game. The user's first guess was ""guessed-word"", but that is not a 5-letter word. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the previous response.

 Let me clarify: The user asked for the first guess, and in my previous response, I intended to guess ""RAISE"", but I see that I wrote ""guessed-word"" in the response format. That was a mistake.

 Actually, looking back at the previous response, I said:
   ""Therefore, my first guess will be: RAISE""

 But then in the response format, I wrote: <guess>guessed-word</guess>

 That was incorrect. I should have written: <guess>RAISE</guess>

 However, the user is now providing feedback based on that incorrect guess? The feedback says: 
   ""Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.""

 So, because ""guessed-word"" is not a 5-letter word, it's invalid.

 Now the user is asking for a new 5-letter word guess. Since the first guess was invalid, we are still at the first guess.

 I need to make a valid first guess.

 Let me choose a valid 5-letter word. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as I intended.

 But note: the user might have meant that the previous response was invalid, so we are starting over.

 Therefore, I will make a new first guess: ""RAISE""

 However, to be safe, I can choose a different word. But ""RAISE"" is a good starter.

 Alternatively, I can use ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". Let me pick ""CRANE"" this time to avoid confusion.

 Why ""CRANE""? 
   - It has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
   - It covers three vowels (A, E) and two consonants (C, R, N).

 So, I'll guess ""CRANE"".

 But note: the user might be expecting a correction. Since the first attempt was invalid, I'll provide a valid 5-letter word.

 Let me output: <guess>CRANE</guess><thinking>
I need to make a valid 5-letter word guess since the previous attempt (""guessed-word"") was invalid. For an optimal first guess, I should choose a word with common letters to maximize information. Good starter words typically include frequent vowels and consonants. 

After considering options like ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) and ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E), I'll choose **""RAISE""** because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)
- It covers five distinct letters to test multiple positions
- It's a statistically strong opener in word games

This guess will provide clear feedback about which letters are present and their positions.

<guess>guessed-word</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We've had two consecutive invalid guesses (""guessed-word"" both times) because they weren't 5-letter words. Now I need to provide a valid 5-letter word for the first real guess.

Important: The game requires a valid 5-letter English word. I must ensure my guess meets this criterion.

For an optimal first guess, I'll select a word that:
- Uses common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
- Has all distinct letters to maximize information
- Is a recognized English word

Strong candidates include:
- ""CRANE"": Contains C, R, A, N, E → covers 3 vowels and 2 consonants
- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E → similarly effective
- Other common starters: ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", ""ADIEU""

After reevaluating, I'll choose **""CRANE""** because:
- It has the statistically beneficial letters C, R, A, N, E
- It avoids repeating previous invalid responses
- It's frequently recommended as an optimal Wordle opener

Let's confirm it's 5 letters: C-R-A-N-E → yes.<thinking>
The previous guesses (""guessed-word"") were invalid as they were not 5-letter words. For a valid first guess, I need a strategic 5-letter English word to maximize information gain. 

I'll choose **""CRANE""** because:
- It contains common letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- It uses five distinct letters to test multiple positions
- It includes three vowels (A, E) and two frequent consonants (R, N)
- It's a verified English word frequently used as an optimal starter in similar games

This guess should provide clear feedback on letter positions and occurrences.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from Guess 3: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
 This means:
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (specifically, the 4th letter, since N is the 4th letter in CRANE).
   - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has the letter N in the 4th position, and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
   - Has N in the 4th position.
   - Does not use C, R, A, E (since they are absent).
   - Uses other letters to try to find which letters are present.

 Since we know the 4th letter is N, we can fix that.

 Let me denote the word as: _ _ _ N _

 We know the word does not contain: C, R, A, E.

 We need to choose a word that has N in the 4th position and uses other common letters.

 Common consonants left: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.
 Vowels left: O, I, U (but note we have no vowels so far, so we must include some to cover possibilities).

 Since we have no vowels known, and A and E are out, we should try a word with O or I or U.

 Let's think of words that have N in the 4th position.

 Example: 
   - LION? -> L I O N (but then we need a 5th letter, and LION is 4 letters). So not 5.
   - We need 5-letter words.

 Let me list some 5-letter words with N in the 4th position and without C, R, A, E.

 Possibilities: 
   - POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> 4th is N. But does it have forbidden letters? P, O, I, N, T. None of C,R,A,E. So valid.
   - JOINT: J-O-I-N-T -> same, but J is less common.
   - MOUNT: M-O-U-N-T -> M, O, U, N, T -> no C,R,A,E.
   - COUNT: but C is forbidden -> invalid.
   - FOUND: F-O-U-N-D -> F is allowed, but D is allowed. But we have U and O.

 However, we don't know if O, I, U are in the word. We need to test common letters.

 Since we have limited information, we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 We also have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.

 Let me think of a word that has N in the 4th position and includes common letters we haven't tried.

 We haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, etc.

 One good candidate: POINT -> letters: P, O, I, N, T. 
   - P, O, I, T are new and common.

 Another candidate: JOINT -> but J is less common, so POINT is better.

 Another: MOUNT -> M, O, U, N, T -> we get to test M, O, U, T.

 But note: we already know N is in the 4th position, so we don't need to test N again? Actually, we are using it to fix the position.

 However, we are allowed to reuse a known correct letter in the same position to help with other letters.

 But in this case, we must have N in the 4th position.

 Another candidate: SHUNT -> S, H, U, N, T -> tests S, H, U, T.

 But H is less common than O or I.

 Another: BLUNT -> B, L, U, N, T -> tests B, L, U, T.

 But we don't know if B or L are in the word.

 Considering maximizing information, we want to test as many common letters as possible.

 The most common letters in English (without C, R, A, E) are: S, T, L, O, I, N (but N we already know).

 So POINT: P, O, I, T -> and P is also common.

 Alternatively, we could try a word with S and T, like STOMP? But then N is not in the 4th position. We must have N in the 4th.

 So we need a word that ends with ""N"" as the 4th, so the pattern is ???N?.

 Words: 
   - ...N. -> so the last letter can be any letter.

 Let me think of common words: 
   - POINT: P O I N T -> 4th is N, 5th is T.
   - JOINT: J O I N T
   - MOUNT: M O U N T
   - FOUND: but F O U N D -> but we have F and D, and U. But F and D are less common? 
   - BOUND: B O U N D -> same.

 But note: we also want to avoid using too many vowels if we are not sure, but we need to test vowels.

 Since we have no vowels confirmed (only that A and E are absent), we should test O and I or O and U.

 POINT tests O and I.

 MOUNT tests O and U.

 Which one? Both are good. I'll go with POINT because I is more common than U.

 But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

 However, since we are in the second real guess (first valid one was CRANE, now this is the second), we can try POINT.

 But wait: we have already used the letter N in CRANE and it was correct, so we are keeping it. But in POINT, we are using N again in the same position, which is good.

 So let's guess POINT.

 However, we must ensure we don't use any forbidden letters: C, R, A, E. POINT has none of these.

 Therefore, I'll guess POINT.

 But let me double-check: 
   P: not forbidden
   O: not forbidden
   I: not forbidden
   N: we know is in the word (and in the correct position)
   T: not forbidden

 So it's safe.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has S, because S is very common. For example, STINT: S T I N T -> but T is repeated? And we don't know if T is in the word. Also, STINT has two T's, which might not be efficient if the word doesn't have T.

 Another: POINT seems fine.

 Or JOINTS? But that's 6 letters.

 We must stick to 5 letters.

 Another candidate: SPOON? But O is repeated and the 4th letter is O, not N. So no.

 We must have N in the 4th.

 So I think POINT is a good choice.

 Let me go with POINT.Based on the feedback from the last guess ""CRANE"":
- **N is correct and in the right position (4th letter)**.
- **C, R, A, E are absent** from the secret word.

### Key Constraints:
- The 4th letter must be **N**.
- The word **cannot contain C, R, A, or E**.
- We need to test new common letters (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, P) to gather more information.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Choose a word with **N in the 4th position** and **new high-frequency letters**.
- Prioritize testing vowels (O, I, U) since no vowels are confirmed yet (A/E are ruled out).
- Avoid reused letters (C, R, A, E) and focus on unexplored consonants like T, S, P.

### Selected Guess: **POINT**
- **P**: New consonant (common, untested).
- **O, I**: New vowels (critical to test, as no vowels are confirmed).
- **N**: Fixed in the 4th position (known from feedback).
- **T**: New consonant (high frequency).
- **All letters are distinct** and valid (no C, R, A, E).

This guess efficiently tests 4 new letters while respecting the constraints. If O or I appear in the feedback, it will reveal vowel positions; if absent, we eliminate them.

Both are good. I\'ll go with POINT because I is more common than U.\n\n But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know.\n\n However, since we are in the second real guess (first valid one was CRANE, now this is the second), we can try POINT.\n\n But wait: we have already used the letter N in CRANE and it was correct, so we are keeping it. But in POINT, we are using N again in the same position, which is good.\n\n So let\'s guess POINT.\n\n However, we must ensure we don\'t use any forbidden letters: C, R, A, E. POINT has none of these.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll guess POINT.\n\n But let me double-check: \n   P: not forbidden\n   O: not forbidden\n   I: not forbidden\n   N: we know is in the word (and in the correct position)\n   T: not forbidden\n\n So it\'s safe.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that has S, because S is very common. For example, STINT: S T I N T -> but T is repeated? And we don\'t know if T is in the word. Also, STINT has two T\'s, which might not be efficient if the word doesn\'t have T.\n\n Another: POINT seems fine.\n\n Or JOINTS? But that\'s 6 letters.\n\n We must stick to 5 letters.\n\n Another candidate: SPOON? But O is repeated and the 4th letter is O, not N. So no.\n\n We must have N in the 4th.\n\n So I think POINT is a good choice.\n\n Let me go with POINT.Based on the feedback from the last guess ""CRANE"":\n- **N is correct and in the right position (4th letter)**.\n- **C, R, A, E are absent** from the secret word.\n\n### Key Constraints:\n- The 4th letter must be **N**.\n- The word **cannot contain C, R, A, or E**.\n- We need to test new common letters (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, P) to gather more information.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Choose a word with **N in the 4th position** and **new high-frequency letters**.\n- Prioritize testing vowels (O, I, U) since no vowels are confirmed yet (A/E are ruled out).\n- Avoid reused letters (C, R, A, E) and focus on unexplored consonants like T, S, P.\n\n### Selected Guess: **POINT**\n- **P**: New consonant (common, untested).\n- **O, I**: New vowels (critical to test, as no vowels are confirmed).\n- **N**: Fixed in the 4th position (known from feedback).\n- **T**: New consonant (high frequency).\n- **All letters are distinct** and valid (no C, R, A, E).\n\nThis guess efficiently tests 4 new letters while respecting the constraints.

Feedback from Guess 4: POINT → P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x)

Summary:
- **N** remains correct and in the **4th position** (as indicated by ✓).
- **P, O, I, T are absent** from the secret word (all marked x).

Combining with earlier feedback from Guess 3 (CRANE → C, R, A, E absent), we now know:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T
- **Confirmed letter/position**: **N** in the **4th position** → _ _ _ N _

### Current Constraints:
1. The secret word is _ _ _ N _
2. It **cannot contain**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T
3. We must choose a guess that:
   - Includes **N in the 4th position**
   - Uses only letters not in the absent list
   - Tests new common letters to reveal other positions

### Available Letters:
- Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Remaining vowels: U (since A, E, O, I are out)
- Note: U is the only vowel left, so it must be included if the word has a vowel. However, words can sometimes have Y as a vowel (e.g., ""GYPSY""), but Y is typically a consonant.

### Strategy:
- **Test U and other high-frequency consonants** (S, L, M, D, etc.).
- Since U is the only untested vowel, prioritize including it unless structural constraints prohibit.
- Find 5-letter words fitting _ _ _ N _ without using forbidden letters.

### Brainstorming Words:
- **With U**:  
  - _ _ U N _ → Possible words:  
    - ""BLUNK"" (not a word)  
    - ""FLUNK"" (F-L-U-N-K) — valid? Meaning: to fail. Letters: F, L, U, N, K → all allowed.  
    - Other options: ""HUNKS"" (5th letter S? But pattern would be H U N K S → 4th is N? Yes, but S is at 5th).  
    - ""LUNGY"" (invalid).  
    - Common words: ""SUNNY"" (but N is repeated? We don't know if N appears twice).  
    - Since the 4th is N, we focus on words like X X X N X with U.  

- **Without U (if U absent)** — but we must test it:  
  - If U is absent, the word relies on Y (as in words like ""GYPSY"") or no vowel? But English words require vowels. Since A,E,I,O are out, U must be present or Y as vowel.  
  - So assume **U is likely present**.  

### Top Candidates:
1. **FLUNK**  
   - F, L, U, N, K → Tests F, L, U, K  
   - Advantages: Tests U and common consonants (F, L, K)  
2. **HUMAN** → Contains A (forbidden).  
3. **FOUND** → Contains O (forbidden) and D? But O is out.  
4. **USING** → Contains I (forbidden) and S,G.  
5. **LUNGS** → L-U-N-G-S → Tests L, U, G, S → Forbidden? No A,E,O,I,T etc. G and S are new.  

Considering FLUNK and LUNGS:  
- **FLUNK**: Tests F, L, U, K  
- **LUNGS**: Tests L, U, G, S  

Both test U, L. LUNGS also tests S (high frequency) and G, which makes it marginally better for coverage.  

### Decision: **LUNGS**
- _ _ _ N _ → L U N G S  
- Pattern: 1st=L, 2nd=U, 3rd=N? Wait no — N is fixed in 4th:  
  - Position: 1st: L, 2nd: U, 3rd: ? → Actually 3rd is G?  
  - Correct pattern: **L U N G S** → so:  
    - Pos1: L  
    - Pos2: U  
    - Pos3: ??? → Wait, no: LUNGS is L-U-N-G-S → so 3rd is N? But N must be in 4th! Mistake.  

Oh no: **LUNGS** has N in the **third position**, not fourth. It spells L-U-N-G-S → positions:  
1. L, 2. U, 3. N, 4. G, 5. S → but we need N in 4th. So invalid for our constraint.  

**Correct Pattern**: We need _ _ _ N _ → so the 4th is N, and **LUNGS** puts N in 3rd (not allowed).  

**Revised Candidates** (with N in 4th and without forbidden letters):  
1. **BLUNK** → Invalid word.  
2. **FLUNK**: F-L-U-N-K → positions:  
   - Pos1: F, Pos2: L, Pos3: U, **Pos4: N**, Pos5: K → valid.  
3. **CONKY** → Contains C and O (forbidden).  
4. **FUNKY** → F-U-N-K-Y → N in 3rd? F(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),Y(5) → N in 3rd ≠ 4th.  
5. **BUNKS** → B-U-N-K-S → positions: B(1), U(2), N(3) → N in 3rd (wrong).  

**Pattern must be X X X N X**: First three letters arbitrary (but not forbidden), then N in 4th, last letter arbitrary.  

Actual English words:  
- **FLUNG** → F-L-U-N-G → F(1), L(2), U(3), **N(4)**, G(5) → perfect!  
- Meaning: past tense of fling → valid.  
- Letters: F, L, U, N, G → all allowed (C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T forbidden).  

**Better**: **FLUNG** vs. FLUNK (FLUNK has K instead of G).  
- FLUNG tests F, L, U, G  
- FLUNK tests F, L, U, K  

Both valid, but **FLUNG** might be preferable because G is more common than K.  

Other options:  
- **SHUNS** → S-H-U-N-S → positions: S(1), H(2), U(3), **N(4)**, S(5) → tests S, H, U (and S repeated).  
- **SHUNT** → S-H-U-N-T → but T is forbidden (from POINT feedback: T absent).  

**SHUNS**: Contains U, tests S and H → but S appears twice, which might not be ideal.  

**Preferred Guess: FLUNG**  
- Tests F, L, U, G (all new)  
- Fixes N in 4th  
- Avoids repeated letters.  

### Final Selection: **FLUNG**  
<thinking>
The feedback confirms:
- **N** is fixed in position 4.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T (from CRANE and POINT guesses).

Thus:
- Secret pattern: _ _ _ N _.
- We must test new letters from the available pool (B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).

Optimal guess: **FLUNG** (F-L-U-N-G) because:
- Tests frequent consonants F, L, G and the critical vowel U.
- Avoids absent letters and reuses N correctly in position 4.
- Maximizes new letter coverage for efficient elimination.
- Valid English word (past participle of ""fling"").

If U appears, we'll confirm a vowel; if not, Y becomes the focus in future guesses.

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:  
- **N is confirmed in the 4th position** (pattern: `_ _ _ N _`).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T (eliminated).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:  
- Prioritize testing the **remaining vowel ""U""** and **new high-frequency consonants** (F, L, S, G, etc.).  
- Choose a word that fits `_ _ _ N _` **without using eliminated letters**, focusing on untested consonants like F, L, U, G, K, S.  

### Selected Guess: **FLUNG**  
- **F, L, U, G**: Untested letters → tests U (critical vowel) + common consonants.  
- **N**: Correctly placed in position 4.  
- Avoids all forbidden letters (C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T).

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,funny,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word.
 Since there's no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information gained.
 Common vowels and consonants are helpful. Words like 'SLATE', 'CRANE', 'ROUSE', etc., are often good starters.

 However, I recall that 'RAISE' is a popular starter because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (R, S). 
 Alternatively, 'SLATE' has S, L, A, T, E which covers multiple common letters.

 But let me consider a word that has a good distribution of common letters.

 Among the top choices for Wordle starters, 'CRATE' is also good: C, R, A, T, E.

 I think I'll go with 'RAISE' because it has the letters R, A, I, S, E which are all quite common.

 Therefore, my first guess will be: RAISE

 But note: the problem says to return in the format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>For the first guess without any prior feedback, I chose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information. ""RAISE"" contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps identify recurring letters and positions efficiently. This word is also a valid English word frequently used as a starting guess in similar games.

<guess>guessed-word</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are at the beginning of the game. The user's first guess was ""guessed-word"", but that is not a 5-letter word. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the previous response.

 Let me clarify: The user asked for the first guess, and in my previous response, I intended to guess ""RAISE"", but I see that I wrote ""guessed-word"" in the response format. That was a mistake.

 Actually, looking back at the previous response, I said:
   ""Therefore, my first guess will be: RAISE""

 But then in the response format, I wrote: <guess>guessed-word</guess>

 That was incorrect. I should have written: <guess>RAISE</guess>

 However, the user is now providing feedback based on that incorrect guess? The feedback says: 
   ""Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.""

 So, because ""guessed-word"" is not a 5-letter word, it's invalid.

 Now the user is asking for a new 5-letter word guess. Since the first guess was invalid, we are still at the first guess.

 I need to make a valid first guess.

 Let me choose a valid 5-letter word. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as I intended.

 But note: the user might have meant that the previous response was invalid, so we are starting over.

 Therefore, I will make a new first guess: ""RAISE""

 However, to be safe, I can choose a different word. But ""RAISE"" is a good starter.

 Alternatively, I can use ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". Let me pick ""CRANE"" this time to avoid confusion.

 Why ""CRANE""? 
   - It has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
   - It covers three vowels (A, E) and two consonants (C, R, N).

 So, I'll guess ""CRANE"".

 But note: the user might be expecting a correction. Since the first attempt was invalid, I'll provide a valid 5-letter word.

 Let me output: <guess>CRANE</guess><thinking>
I need to make a valid 5-letter word guess since the previous attempt (""guessed-word"") was invalid. For an optimal first guess, I should choose a word with common letters to maximize information. Good starter words typically include frequent vowels and consonants. 

After considering options like ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) and ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E), I'll choose **""RAISE""** because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)
- It covers five distinct letters to test multiple positions
- It's a statistically strong opener in word games

This guess will provide clear feedback about which letters are present and their positions.

<guess>guessed-word</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We've had two consecutive invalid guesses (""guessed-word"" both times) because they weren't 5-letter words. Now I need to provide a valid 5-letter word for the first real guess.

Important: The game requires a valid 5-letter English word. I must ensure my guess meets this criterion.

For an optimal first guess, I'll select a word that:
- Uses common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
- Has all distinct letters to maximize information
- Is a recognized English word

Strong candidates include:
- ""CRANE"": Contains C, R, A, N, E → covers 3 vowels and 2 consonants
- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E → similarly effective
- Other common starters: ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", ""ADIEU""

After reevaluating, I'll choose **""CRANE""** because:
- It has the statistically beneficial letters C, R, A, N, E
- It avoids repeating previous invalid responses
- It's frequently recommended as an optimal Wordle opener

Let's confirm it's 5 letters: C-R-A-N-E → yes.<thinking>
The previous guesses (""guessed-word"") were invalid as they were not 5-letter words. For a valid first guess, I need a strategic 5-letter English word to maximize information gain. 

I'll choose **""CRANE""** because:
- It contains common letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- It uses five distinct letters to test multiple positions
- It includes three vowels (A, E) and two frequent consonants (R, N)
- It's a verified English word frequently used as an optimal starter in similar games

This guess should provide clear feedback on letter positions and occurrences.

<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from Guess 3: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
 This means:
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (specifically, the 4th letter, since N is the 4th letter in CRANE).
   - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has the letter N in the 4th position, and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
   - Has N in the 4th position.
   - Does not use C, R, A, E (since they are absent).
   - Uses other letters to try to find which letters are present.

 Since we know the 4th letter is N, we can fix that.

 Let me denote the word as: _ _ _ N _

 We know the word does not contain: C, R, A, E.

 We need to choose a word that has N in the 4th position and uses other common letters.

 Common consonants left: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.
 Vowels left: O, I, U (but note we have no vowels so far, so we must include some to cover possibilities).

 Since we have no vowels known, and A and E are out, we should try a word with O or I or U.

 Let's think of words that have N in the 4th position.

 Example: 
   - LION? -> L I O N (but then we need a 5th letter, and LION is 4 letters). So not 5.
   - We need 5-letter words.

 Let me list some 5-letter words with N in the 4th position and without C, R, A, E.

 Possibilities: 
   - POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> 4th is N. But does it have forbidden letters? P, O, I, N, T. None of C,R,A,E. So valid.
   - JOINT: J-O-I-N-T -> same, but J is less common.
   - MOUNT: M-O-U-N-T -> M, O, U, N, T -> no C,R,A,E.
   - COUNT: but C is forbidden -> invalid.
   - FOUND: F-O-U-N-D -> F is allowed, but D is allowed. But we have U and O.

 However, we don't know if O, I, U are in the word. We need to test common letters.

 Since we have limited information, we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 We also have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.

 Let me think of a word that has N in the 4th position and includes common letters we haven't tried.

 We haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, etc.

 One good candidate: POINT -> letters: P, O, I, N, T. 
   - P, O, I, T are new and common.

 Another candidate: JOINT -> but J is less common, so POINT is better.

 Another: MOUNT -> M, O, U, N, T -> we get to test M, O, U, T.

 But note: we already know N is in the 4th position, so we don't need to test N again? Actually, we are using it to fix the position.

 However, we are allowed to reuse a known correct letter in the same position to help with other letters.

 But in this case, we must have N in the 4th position.

 Another candidate: SHUNT -> S, H, U, N, T -> tests S, H, U, T.

 But H is less common than O or I.

 Another: BLUNT -> B, L, U, N, T -> tests B, L, U, T.

 But we don't know if B or L are in the word.

 Considering maximizing information, we want to test as many common letters as possible.

 The most common letters in English (without C, R, A, E) are: S, T, L, O, I, N (but N we already know).

 So POINT: P, O, I, T -> and P is also common.

 Alternatively, we could try a word with S and T, like STOMP? But then N is not in the 4th position. We must have N in the 4th.

 So we need a word that ends with ""N"" as the 4th, so the pattern is ???N?.

 Words: 
   - ...N. -> so the last letter can be any letter.

 Let me think of common words: 
   - POINT: P O I N T -> 4th is N, 5th is T.
   - JOINT: J O I N T
   - MOUNT: M O U N T
   - FOUND: but F O U N D -> but we have F and D, and U. But F and D are less common? 
   - BOUND: B O U N D -> same.

 But note: we also want to avoid using too many vowels if we are not sure, but we need to test vowels.

 Since we have no vowels confirmed (only that A and E are absent), we should test O and I or O and U.

 POINT tests O and I.

 MOUNT tests O and U.

 Which one? Both are good. I'll go with POINT because I is more common than U.

 But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

 However, since we are in the second real guess (first valid one was CRANE, now this is the second), we can try POINT.

 But wait: we have already used the letter N in CRANE and it was correct, so we are keeping it. But in POINT, we are using N again in the same position, which is good.

 So let's guess POINT.

 However, we must ensure we don't use any forbidden letters: C, R, A, E. POINT has none of these.

 Therefore, I'll guess POINT.

 But let me double-check: 
   P: not forbidden
   O: not forbidden
   I: not forbidden
   N: we know is in the word (and in the correct position)
   T: not forbidden

 So it's safe.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has S, because S is very common. For example, STINT: S T I N T -> but T is repeated? And we don't know if T is in the word. Also, STINT has two T's, which might not be efficient if the word doesn't have T.

 Another: POINT seems fine.

 Or JOINTS? But that's 6 letters.

 We must stick to 5 letters.

 Another candidate: SPOON? But O is repeated and the 4th letter is O, not N. So no.

 We must have N in the 4th.

 So I think POINT is a good choice.

 Let me go with POINT.Based on the feedback from the last guess ""CRANE"":
- **N is correct and in the right position (4th letter)**.
- **C, R, A, E are absent** from the secret word.

### Key Constraints:
- The 4th letter must be **N**.
- The word **cannot contain C, R, A, or E**.
- We need to test new common letters (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, P) to gather more information.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Choose a word with **N in the 4th position** and **new high-frequency letters**.
- Prioritize testing vowels (O, I, U) since no vowels are confirmed yet (A/E are ruled out).
- Avoid reused letters (C, R, A, E) and focus on unexplored consonants like T, S, P.

### Selected Guess: **POINT**
- **P**: New consonant (common, untested).
- **O, I**: New vowels (critical to test, as no vowels are confirmed).
- **N**: Fixed in the 4th position (known from feedback).
- **T**: New consonant (high frequency).
- **All letters are distinct** and valid (no C, R, A, E).

This guess efficiently tests 4 new letters while respecting the constraints. If O or I appear in the feedback, it will reveal vowel positions; if absent, we eliminate them.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: guessed-word -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 4: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Feedback from Guess 4: POINT → P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x)

Summary:
- **N** remains correct and in the **4th position** (as indicated by ✓).
- **P, O, I, T are absent** from the secret word (all marked x).

Combining with earlier feedback from Guess 3 (CRANE → C, R, A, E absent), we now know:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T
- **Confirmed letter/position**: **N** in the **4th position** → _ _ _ N _

### Current Constraints:
1. The secret word is _ _ _ N _
2. It **cannot contain**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T
3. We must choose a guess that:
   - Includes **N in the 4th position**
   - Uses only letters not in the absent list
   - Tests new common letters to reveal other positions

### Available Letters:
- Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Remaining vowels: U (since A, E, O, I are out)
- Note: U is the only vowel left, so it must be included if the word has a vowel. However, words can sometimes have Y as a vowel (e.g., ""GYPSY""), but Y is typically a consonant.

### Strategy:
- **Test U and other high-frequency consonants** (S, L, M, D, etc.).
- Since U is the only untested vowel, prioritize including it unless structural constraints prohibit.
- Find 5-letter words fitting _ _ _ N _ without using forbidden letters.

### Brainstorming Words:
- **With U**:  
  - _ _ U N _ → Possible words:  
    - ""BLUNK"" (not a word)  
    - ""FLUNK"" (F-L-U-N-K) — valid? Meaning: to fail. Letters: F, L, U, N, K → all allowed.  
    - Other options: ""HUNKS"" (5th letter S? But pattern would be H U N K S → 4th is N? Yes, but S is at 5th).  
    - ""LUNGY"" (invalid).  
    - Common words: ""SUNNY"" (but N is repeated? We don't know if N appears twice).  
    - Since the 4th is N, we focus on words like X X X N X with U.  

- **Without U (if U absent)** — but we must test it:  
  - If U is absent, the word relies on Y (as in words like ""GYPSY"") or no vowel? But English words require vowels. Since A,E,I,O are out, U must be present or Y as vowel.  
  - So assume **U is likely present**.  

### Top Candidates:
1. **FLUNK**  
   - F, L, U, N, K → Tests F, L, U, K  
   - Advantages: Tests U and common consonants (F, L, K)  
2. **HUMAN** → Contains A (forbidden).  
3. **FOUND** → Contains O (forbidden) and D? But O is out.  
4. **USING** → Contains I (forbidden) and S,G.  
5. **LUNGS** → L-U-N-G-S → Tests L, U, G, S → Forbidden? No A,E,O,I,T etc. G and S are new.  

Considering FLUNK and LUNGS:  
- **FLUNK**: Tests F, L, U, K  
- **LUNGS**: Tests L, U, G, S  

Both test U, L. LUNGS also tests S (high frequency) and G, which makes it marginally better for coverage.  

### Decision: **LUNGS**
- _ _ _ N _ → L U N G S  
- Pattern: 1st=L, 2nd=U, 3rd=N? Wait no — N is fixed in 4th:  
  - Position: 1st: L, 2nd: U, 3rd: ? → Actually 3rd is G?  
  - Correct pattern: **L U N G S** → so:  
    - Pos1: L  
    - Pos2: U  
    - Pos3: ??? → Wait, no: LUNGS is L-U-N-G-S → so 3rd is N? But N must be in 4th! Mistake.  

Oh no: **LUNGS** has N in the **third position**, not fourth. It spells L-U-N-G-S → positions:  
1. L, 2. U, 3. N, 4. G, 5. S → but we need N in 4th. So invalid for our constraint.  

**Correct Pattern**: We need _ _ _ N _ → so the 4th is N, and **LUNGS** puts N in 3rd (not allowed).  

**Revised Candidates** (with N in 4th and without forbidden letters):  
1. **BLUNK** → Invalid word.  
2. **FLUNK**: F-L-U-N-K → positions:  
   - Pos1: F, Pos2: L, Pos3: U, **Pos4: N**, Pos5: K → valid.  
3. **CONKY** → Contains C and O (forbidden).  
4. **FUNKY** → F-U-N-K-Y → N in 3rd? F(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),Y(5) → N in 3rd ≠ 4th.  
5. **BUNKS** → B-U-N-K-S → positions: B(1), U(2), N(3) → N in 3rd (wrong).  

**Pattern must be X X X N X**: First three letters arbitrary (but not forbidden), then N in 4th, last letter arbitrary.  

Actual English words:  
- **FLUNG** → F-L-U-N-G → F(1), L(2), U(3), **N(4)**, G(5) → perfect!  
- Meaning: past tense of fling → valid.  
- Letters: F, L, U, N, G → all allowed (C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T forbidden).  

**Better**: **FLUNG** vs. FLUNK (FLUNK has K instead of G).  
- FLUNG tests F, L, U, G  
- FLUNK tests F, L, U, K  

Both valid, but **FLUNG** might be preferable because G is more common than K.  

Other options:  
- **SHUNS** → S-H-U-N-S → positions: S(1), H(2), U(3), **N(4)**, S(5) → tests S, H, U (and S repeated).  
- **SHUNT** → S-H-U-N-T → but T is forbidden (from POINT feedback: T absent).  

**SHUNS**: Contains U, tests S and H → but S appears twice, which might not be ideal.  

**Preferred Guess: FLUNG**  
- Tests F, L, U, G (all new)  
- Fixes N in 4th  
- Avoids repeated letters.  

### Final Selection: **FLUNG**  
<thinking>
The feedback confirms:
- **N** is fixed in position 4.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T (from CRANE and POINT guesses).

Thus:
- Secret pattern: _ _ _ N _.
- We must test new letters from the available pool (B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).

Optimal guess: **FLUNG** (F-L-U-N-G) because:
- Tests frequent consonants F, L, G and the critical vowel U.
- Avoids absent letters and reuses N correctly in position 4.
- Maximizes new letter coverage for efficient elimination.
- Valid English word (past participle of ""fling"").

If U appears, we'll confirm a vowel; if not, Y becomes the focus in future guesses.
</thinking>
<guess>FLUNG</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:  
- **N is confirmed in the 4th position** (pattern: `_ _ _ N _`).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T (eliminated).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:  
- Prioritize testing the **remaining vowel ""U""** and **new high-frequency consonants** (F, L, S, G, etc.).  
- Choose a word that fits `_ _ _ N _` **without using eliminated letters**, focusing on untested consonants like F, L, U, G, K, S.  

### Selected Guess: **FLUNG**  
- **F, L, U, G**: Untested letters → tests U (critical vowel) + common consonants.  
- **N**: Correctly placed in position 4.  
- Avoids all forbidden letters (C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T).

But F and D are less common? \n   - BOUND: B O U N D -> same.\n\n But note: we also want to avoid using too many vowels if we are not sure, but we need to test vowels.\n\n Since we have no vowels confirmed (only that A and E are absent), we should test O and I or O and U.\n\n POINT tests O and I.\n\n MOUNT tests O and U.\n\n Which one? Both are good. I\'ll go with POINT because I is more common than U.\n\n But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know.\n\n However, since we are in the second real guess (first valid one was CRANE, now this is the second), we can try POINT.\n\n But wait: we have already used the letter N in CRANE and it was correct, so we are keeping it. But in POINT, we are using N again in the same position, which is good.\n\n So let\'s guess POINT.\n\n However, we must ensure we don\'t use any forbidden letters: C, R, A, E. POINT has none of these.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll guess POINT.\n\n But let me double-check: \n   P: not forbidden\n   O: not forbidden\n   I: not forbidden\n   N: we know is in the word (and in the correct position)\n   T: not forbidden\n\n So it\'s safe.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that has S, because S is very common. For example, STINT: S T I N T -> but T is repeated? And we don\'t know if T is in the word. Also, STINT has two T\'s, which might not be efficient if the word doesn\'t have T.\n\n Another: POINT seems fine.\n\n Or JOINTS? But that\'s 6 letters.\n\n We must stick to 5 letters.\n\n Another candidate: SPOON? But O is repeated and the 4th letter is O, not N. So no.\n\n We must have N in the 4th.\n\n So I think POINT is a good choice.\n\n Let me go with POINT.Based on the feedback from the last guess ""CRANE"":\n- **N is correct and in the right position (4th letter)**.\n- **C, R, A, E are absent** from the secret word.\n\n### Key Constraints:\n- The 4th letter must be **N**.\n- The word **cannot contain C, R, A, or E**.\n- We need to test new common letters (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, P) to gather more information.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Choose a word with **N in the 4th position** and **new high-frequency letters**.\n- Prioritize testing vowels (O, I, U) since no vowels are confirmed yet (A/E are ruled out).\n- Avoid reused letters (C, R, A, E) and focus on unexplored consonants like T, S, P.\n\n### Selected Guess: **POINT**\n- **P**: New consonant (common, untested).\n- **O, I**: New vowels (critical to test, as no vowels are confirmed).\n- **N**: Fixed in the 4th position (known from feedback).\n- **T**: New consonant (high frequency).\n- **All letters are distinct** and valid (no C, R, A, E).\n\nThis guess efficiently tests 4 new letters while respecting the constraints.

We have the latest feedback from Guess 5: FLUNG → F(✓) L(x) U(-) N(✓) G(x)

Interpretation:
- **F is correct** and in the right position (1st letter) → so the word starts with F.
- **L is absent** (x) → not in the word at all.
- **U is present but in the wrong position** (-) → U is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (where we had it).
- **N is correct** and in the 4th position (still ✓) → remains fixed.
- **G is absent** (x) → not in the word.

Additionally, we know from previous guesses:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, L, G (since L and G are now marked absent in this guess)
- Present letters: F (fixed at position 1), U (somewhere not position 3), N (fixed at position 4)

So current constraints:
- Word pattern: F _ _ N _
- Contains the letter U, but not in position 3 (and also not in position 1 or 4 because we have fixed F and N there).
- So U could be in position 2 or 5? Let's see: positions are: 1:F, 2:?, 3:?, 4:N, 5:?
- U is in the word but not in position 3 → so U must be in position 2 or 5.

Also, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, L, G

Now, we need to think of words that:
- Start with F
- Have N as the fourth letter
- Contain U (in either position 2 or 5, since it can't be in 3 and positions 1 and 4 are fixed)
- Use letters from the remaining pool: available letters excluding absent ones.

Available letters (not absent): B, D, H, J, K, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z and U (which we know is present).

But note: U is present, and we are going to include it either in position 2 or 5.

We must form a valid English word.

Case 1: U in position 2 → pattern: F U _ N _
Now, what can fill positions 3 and 5? They must be letters from the available set and form a word.

Possible words? Let's think:
- FUN words? But F U _ N _ → we need a word like ""FUNNY""? But N is already in position 4, and position 3 could be something else. Also, ""FUNNY"" has two N's? But we have pattern F U _ N _ → ""FUNNY"" is F-U-N-N-Y → that would be position 3 is N, but then we already have N fixed at position 4. So position 3 cannot be N? Wait, but the secret word might have duplicates? We don't know.

Let's check: if we put U in position 2, then the word is F U ? N ?

Possible words:
- ""FUNKY"": but K is allowed? But ""FUNKY"" → F-U-N-K-Y → position 3 is N, but that conflicts: in our pattern, position 3 is ? and position 4 is N. So if position 3 is N, then the pattern would be F U N N ? but that requires two N's. And ""FUNKY"" has N at position 3? Actually: F (1), U (2), N (3), K (4), Y (5) → but we need position 4 to be N, so if we have N at position 3 and 4 that would be two N's? However, the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

But our feedback doesn't show duplicate letters explicitly. We must be cautious.

In our guess of FLUNG, we had F(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), G(5). The feedback showed U as present but wrong position. So if the word were ""FUNKY"", then U is not in position 3 but in position 2? But ""FUNKY"" has U at position 2? No: for ""FUNKY"", position 2 is U? Actually, let's spell:
- F (1), U (2), N (3), K (4), Y (5) → so position 4 is K, not N. But we know position 4 is N.

Therefore, ""FUNKY"" does not fit because position 4 must be N.

So for pattern F U ? N ?:
- We need a word like ""FUNDS""? But D and S are available? But look: F U N D S → that would be position 3 as N? Then position 4 is D? But we need position 4 as N → conflict.

The pattern is F U [position3] N [position5]. So position3 cannot be N? Unless the word has two N's.

So let's think of words of the form F U X N Y, where X and Y are letters? But note that X must not be N? But it could be.

Words: 
- ""FUNGI""? But G is now absent → cannot have G.
- ""FUNDS"": F U N D S → but that has N at position 3, and D at position 4? No: F(1), U(2), N(3), D(4), S(5). But we need position 4 to be N → not possible because D would be at position 4? So only if D were N, but D≠N. Thus, ""FUNDS"" doesn't have N at position 4.

Alternatively, with two N's: if the word has N at position 3 and position 4? So ""FUNNY""? That is F(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5). Yes! So that fits: F U N N Y.

But we must check the letters: 
- F, U, N, N, Y?
- N is repeated → but we haven't ruled out duplicate letters.

Also, letter Y: Y is available? Yes, Y is not in the absent list.

Now, check absent list: no F, U, N, Y? But F and U are already in, and N is confirmed, Y is not forbidden. Also, the word ""FUNNY"" does not contain any other forbidden letters? Let's see: forbidden are C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T,L,G. None of these appear in ""FUNNY"". 

So ""FUNNY"" is a candidate? But the pattern is F U N N Y → positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:N, 4:N.

Wait: position 3 is N? But in our pattern, we have position 4 as N. We have two N's? But that's possible.

Now, note: in our earlier guess FLUNG, we had U in position 3? But in the secret word ""FUNNY"", U is in position 2. And in FLUNG, we had U in position 3 → which is wrong → matches the feedback: U is present but at wrong position (indeed, it should be at position 2, not 3).

Also, in ""FUNNY"", letter L is absent -> we didn't have L, which is correct from feedback. G is absent -> also not in FUNNY.

But what about position 3? In FUNNY, position 3 is N → which we haven't tested in position 3 before? We guessed CRANE: position 3 was A, POINT: position 3 was N? POINT: P-O-I-N-T → position 3 is I? Not N.

In POINT, position 3 was I → marked absent → which is consistent since FUNNY doesn't have I.

But we now have a candidate: FUNNY.

Case 2: U in position 5 → pattern: F _ _ N U

Then, the word would be F ? ? N U

Possible words? Not many: 
- ""FUNKY""? But position 4 is N, position 5 is U → F ? ? N U → but what? We need the first three to spell something? Not known.

Actually, words ending with NU? Like ""MENTH""? Not a word. Or ""WINNU""? Not. Generally, not common.

Another: ""FUNGO""? But O is absent and G is absent.

Probably not many English words ending with NU? So less likely.

Therefore, case 1 (U in position 2) seems more plausible? And FUNNY is a perfect fit.

But let me confirm: ""FUNNY"" meaning something amusing → valid.

But what about other possibilities?

What if we have F ? U N ? → but U cannot be in position 3? We already guessed U in position 3 in FLUNG → and it was marked wrong position → so if we put U in position3 again, that would be same position → invalid. But we can use U in a different position.

In the pattern F ? U N ? → that would be U in position 3? But we know it cannot be because the feedback said U is not in position 3? So we are forced to put U in position 2 or 5.

But if we put it in position 5: F ? ? N U → is there any word? For example, ""FWANU""? Not a word. ""FJORD""? Position 4? FJORD: F(1), J(2), O(3), R(4), D(5) → has O and R? Absent? R is absent → no.

Any other? ""FHENU""? Not a word.

So likely, U is in position 2 → and the word must have a pattern F U ? N Y? Or whatever.

But FUNNY: F U N N Y → fits.

Are there other words? For example, F U S N Y → ""FUSNY""? Not a word.

Or F U B N Y → not a word.

So FUNNY seems a strong candidate.

What about F U D N S? ""FUNDS"" → has position 4 not fixed? As said earlier, FUNDS is F-U-N-D-S → position 4 is D? But we need position 4 to be N → so no.

We were already through this.

Another possibility: ""FUNKY"" → has position 4 as K? No.

So FUNNY is the most likely.

But note: in FUNNY, the third letter is N → which we haven't guessed in that position. We know N is present and at position 4, but there could be another N. So in the feedback for FUNNY, we might get ✓ for N at both positions? But the word has two N's.

But our current feedback doesn't prevent that.

We can also think of other words without double N? But we haven't found one. So FUNNY is a valid word that satisfies all constraints.

Alternatively, what about ""FUNGI""? But G is absent → not possible.

So I think FUNNY is the best guess.

Therefore, I'll guess FUNNY.

But note: we need to confirm the pattern: F U N N Y → positions:
1: F (known ✓)
2: U (we believe)
3: N? But no previous feedback on position 3? We are guessing now.
4: N (known ✓)
5: Y

In FLUNG, we guessed position 3 as U → which was marked as wrong position → which is consistent if U is at position 2 in the secret word.

Moreover, in FUNNY, position 3 is N → which is a new letter position for N.

Also, no forbidden letters.

Another candidate: ""SUNNY"" → but S is not fixed at the start? We need F at the start.

We must have F at position 1.

Similarly, ""RUNNY"" → but R is absent? And no F at start.

So FUNNY is the only common word I can think of.

Therefore, I'll go with FUNNY.
</think>
Following the latest feedback from **Guess 5: FLUNG → F(✓) L(x) U(-) N(✓) G(x)**, we have:

### Key Insights:
1. **F is confirmed** in the **correct position (1st letter)**: The word starts with **F**.
2. **N is confirmed** in the **correct position (4th letter)**: Pattern remains `_ _ _ N _` → so **F _ _ N _**.
3. **U is present but misplaced**: It must be in the word but not in position 3 (where it was guessed). Given positions 1 (F) and 4 (N) are fixed, **U can only be in position 2 or 5**.
4. **New absent letters**: L and G are eliminated (adding to previously absent C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T).

### Constraints Summary:
- **Secret word pattern**: **F _ _ N _**
- **Must include U**: In position **2** or **5**.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, L, G → all forbidden.
- **Available letters**: B, D, H, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (with U confirmed).

### Reasoning for Next Guess:
- We need a valid English word fitting **F _ _ N _** with U in position 2 or 5.
- After brainstorming options, **FUNNY** (F-U-N-N-Y) fits perfectly:
  - **Position 2 = U**: Consistent with feedback (U not in position 3) and fixes U in position 2.
  - **Position 3 = N**: Tests if N appears twice (allowed, as duplicates are possible).
  - **Position 5 = Y**: Tests Y (common end letter) and avoids forbidden letters.
  - If correct, **FUNNY** will reveal:
    - Whether U is correctly placed at position 2.
    - Whether N appears at position 3 (dual Ns).
    - If Y is present/positioned.
- Alternatives like FWUNK (invalid) or FAUNA (A absent) fail, making **FUNNY** the most plausible candidate.

<guess>FUNNY</guess>",FUNNY,"We have the latest feedback from Guess 5: FLUNG → F(✓) L(x) U(-) N(✓) G(x)

Interpretation:
- **F is correct** and in the right position (1st letter) → so the word starts with F.
- **L is absent** (x) → not in the word at all.
- **U is present but in the wrong position** (-) → U is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (where we had it).
- **N is correct** and in the 4th position (still ✓) → remains fixed.
- **G is absent** (x) → not in the word.

Additionally, we know from previous guesses:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, L, G (since L and G are now marked absent in this guess)
- Present letters: F (fixed at position 1), U (somewhere not position 3), N (fixed at position 4)

So current constraints:
- Word pattern: F _ _ N _
- Contains the letter U, but not in position 3 (and also not in position 1 or 4 because we have fixed F and N there).
- So U could be in position 2 or 5? Let's see: positions are: 1:F, 2:?, 3:?, 4:N, 5:?
- U is in the word but not in position 3 → so U must be in position 2 or 5.

Also, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, L, G

Now, we need to think of words that:
- Start with F
- Have N as the fourth letter
- Contain U (in either position 2 or 5, since it can't be in 3 and positions 1 and 4 are fixed)
- Use letters from the remaining pool: available letters excluding absent ones.

Available letters (not absent): B, D, H, J, K, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z and U (which we know is present).

But note: U is present, and we are going to include it either in position 2 or 5.

We must form a valid English word.

Case 1: U in position 2 → pattern: F U _ N _
Now, what can fill positions 3 and 5? They must be letters from the available set and form a word.

Possible words? Let's think:
- FUN words? But F U _ N _ → we need a word like ""FUNNY""? But N is already in position 4, and position 3 could be something else. Also, ""FUNNY"" has two N's? But we have pattern F U _ N _ → ""FUNNY"" is F-U-N-N-Y → that would be position 3 is N, but then we already have N fixed at position 4. So position 3 cannot be N? Wait, but the secret word might have duplicates? We don't know.

Let's check: if we put U in position 2, then the word is F U ? N ?

Possible words:
- ""FUNKY"": but K is allowed? But ""FUNKY"" → F-U-N-K-Y → position 3 is N, but that conflicts: in our pattern, position 3 is ? and position 4 is N. So if position 3 is N, then the pattern would be F U N N ? but that requires two N's. And ""FUNKY"" has N at position 3? Actually: F (1), U (2), N (3), K (4), Y (5) → but we need position 4 to be N, so if we have N at position 3 and 4 that would be two N's? However, the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

But our feedback doesn't show duplicate letters explicitly. We must be cautious.

In our guess of FLUNG, we had F(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), G(5). The feedback showed U as present but wrong position. So if the word were ""FUNKY"", then U is not in position 3 but in position 2? But ""FUNKY"" has U at position 2? No: for ""FUNKY"", position 2 is U? Actually, let's spell:
- F (1), U (2), N (3), K (4), Y (5) → so position 4 is K, not N. But we know position 4 is N.

Therefore, ""FUNKY"" does not fit because position 4 must be N.

So for pattern F U ? N ?:
- We need a word like ""FUNDS""? But D and S are available? But look: F U N D S → that would be position 3 as N? Then position 4 is D? But we need position 4 as N → conflict.

The pattern is F U [position3] N [position5]. So position3 cannot be N? Unless the word has two N's.

So let's think of words of the form F U X N Y, where X and Y are letters? But note that X must not be N? But it could be.

Words: 
- ""FUNGI""? But G is now absent → cannot have G.
- ""FUNDS"": F U N D S → but that has N at position 3, and D at position 4? No: F(1), U(2), N(3), D(4), S(5). But we need position 4 to be N → not possible because D would be at position 4? So only if D were N, but D≠N. Thus, ""FUNDS"" doesn't have N at position 4.

Alternatively, with two N's: if the word has N at position 3 and position 4? So ""FUNNY""? That is F(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5). Yes! So that fits: F U N N Y.

But we must check the letters: 
- F, U, N, N, Y?
- N is repeated → but we haven't ruled out duplicate letters.

Also, letter Y: Y is available? Yes, Y is not in the absent list.

Now, check absent list: no F, U, N, Y? But F and U are already in, and N is confirmed, Y is not forbidden. Also, the word ""FUNNY"" does not contain any other forbidden letters? Let's see: forbidden are C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T,L,G. None of these appear in ""FUNNY"". 

So ""FUNNY"" is a candidate? But the pattern is F U N N Y → positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:N, 4:N.

Wait: position 3 is N? But in our pattern, we have position 4 as N. We have two N's? But that's possible.

Now, note: in our earlier guess FLUNG, we had U in position 3? But in the secret word ""FUNNY"", U is in position 2. And in FLUNG, we had U in position 3 → which is wrong → matches the feedback: U is present but at wrong position (indeed, it should be at position 2, not 3).

Also, in ""FUNNY"", letter L is absent -> we didn't have L, which is correct from feedback. G is absent -> also not in FUNNY.

But what about position 3? In FUNNY, position 3 is N → which we haven't tested in position 3 before? We guessed CRANE: position 3 was A, POINT: position 3 was N? POINT: P-O-I-N-T → position 3 is I? Not N.

In POINT, position 3 was I → marked absent → which is consistent since FUNNY doesn't have I.

But we now have a candidate: FUNNY.

Case 2: U in position 5 → pattern: F _ _ N U

Then, the word would be F ? ? N U

Possible words? Not many: 
- ""FUNKY""? But position 4 is N, position 5 is U → F ? ? N U → but what? We need the first three to spell something? Not known.

Actually, words ending with NU? Like ""MENTH""? Not a word. Or ""WINNU""? Not. Generally, not common.

Another: ""FUNGO""? But O is absent and G is absent.

Probably not many English words ending with NU? So less likely.

Therefore, case 1 (U in position 2) seems more plausible? And FUNNY is a perfect fit.

But let me confirm: ""FUNNY"" meaning something amusing → valid.

But what about other possibilities?

What if we have F ? U N ? → but U cannot be in position 3? We already guessed U in position 3 in FLUNG → and it was marked wrong position → so if we put U in position3 again, that would be same position → invalid. But we can use U in a different position.

In the pattern F ? U N ? → that would be U in position 3? But we know it cannot be because the feedback said U is not in position 3? So we are forced to put U in position 2 or 5.

But if we put it in position 5: F ? ? N U → is there any word? For example, ""FWANU""? Not a word. ""FJORD""? Position 4? FJORD: F(1), J(2), O(3), R(4), D(5) → has O and R? Absent? R is absent → no.

Any other? ""FHENU""? Not a word.

So likely, U is in position 2 → and the word must have a pattern F U ? N Y? Or whatever.

But FUNNY: F U N N Y → fits.

Are there other words? For example, F U S N Y → ""FUSNY""? Not a word.

Or F U B N Y → not a word.

So FUNNY seems a strong candidate.

What about F U D N S? ""FUNDS"" → has position 4 not fixed? As said earlier, FUNDS is F-U-N-D-S → position 4 is D? But we need position 4 to be N → so no.

We were already through this.

Another possibility: ""FUNKY"" → has position 4 as K? No.

So FUNNY is the most likely.

But note: in FUNNY, the third letter is N → which we haven't guessed in that position. We know N is present and at position 4, but there could be another N. So in the feedback for FUNNY, we might get ✓ for N at both positions? But the word has two N's.

But our current feedback doesn't prevent that.

We can also think of other words without double N? But we haven't found one. So FUNNY is a valid word that satisfies all constraints.

Alternatively, what about ""FUNGI""? But G is absent → not possible.

So I think FUNNY is the best guess.

Therefore, I'll guess FUNNY.

But note: we need to confirm the pattern: F U N N Y → positions:
1: F (known ✓)
2: U (we believe)
3: N? But no previous feedback on position 3? We are guessing now.
4: N (known ✓)
5: Y

In FLUNG, we guessed position 3 as U → which was marked as wrong position → which is consistent if U is at position 2 in the secret word.

Moreover, in FUNNY, position 3 is N → which is a new letter position for N.

Also, no forbidden letters.

Another candidate: ""SUNNY"" → but S is not fixed at the start? We need F at the start.

We must have F at position 1.

Similarly, ""RUNNY"" → but R is absent? And no F at start.

So FUNNY is the only common word I can think of.

Therefore, I'll go with FUNNY.Following the latest feedback from **Guess 5: FLUNG → F(✓) L(x) U(-) N(✓) G(x)**, we have:

### Key Insights:
1. **F is confirmed** in the **correct position (1st letter)**: The word starts with **F**.
2. **N is confirmed** in the **correct position (4th letter)**: Pattern remains `_ _ _ N _` → so **F _ _ N _**.
3. **U is present but misplaced**: It must be in the word but not in position 3 (where it was guessed). Given positions 1 (F) and 4 (N) are fixed, **U can only be in position 2 or 5**.
4. **New absent letters**: L and G are eliminated (adding to previously absent C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T).

### Constraints Summary:
- **Secret word pattern**: **F _ _ N _**
- **Must include U**: In position **2** or **5**.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, L, G → all forbidden.
- **Available letters**: B, D, H, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (with U confirmed).

### Reasoning for Next Guess:
- We need a valid English word fitting **F _ _ N _** with U in position 2 or 5.
- After brainstorming options, **FUNNY** (F-U-N-N-Y) fits perfectly:
  - **Position 2 = U**: Consistent with feedback (U not in position 3) and fixes U in position 2.
  - **Position 3 = N**: Tests if N appears twice (allowed, as duplicates are possible).
  - **Position 5 = Y**: Tests Y (common end letter) and avoids forbidden letters.
  - If correct, **FUNNY** will reveal:
    - Whether U is correctly placed at position 2.
    - Whether N appears at position 3 (dual Ns).
    - If Y is present/positioned.
- Alternatives like FWUNK (invalid) or FAUNA (A absent) fail, making **FUNNY** the most plausible candidate.",Guess 6: FUNNY -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) U(✓) N(✓) N(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
