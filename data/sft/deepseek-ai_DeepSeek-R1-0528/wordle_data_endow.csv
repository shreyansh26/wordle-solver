We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and positions to maximize information.
 Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
 A good starting word is often ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Another popular one is ""ROATE"". However, let's choose one that has unique letters and covers common ones.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
   - All letters are distinct, so we get maximum information.

 But note: the problem does not require the word to have distinct letters, but having distinct letters is better for information.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a very good starting word because it has S, L, A, T, E which are all common.

 Since the problem does not specify any constraints on the word, I can choose any valid 5-letter word.

 Let me choose ""SLATE"" for the first guess.

 However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we are free to choose.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice. But let me check: in Wordle, ""CRANE"" is a good starter.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the cumulative return of an investment) is also used by some, but it might be less familiar.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 But wait, the problem says ""valid 5-letter English word"". We must ensure it's valid.

 Let me think of common words: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ADIEU"" (if we want many vowels). 

 I choose ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: x (not in the word)
N: - (in the word but wrong position)
E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters N and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed.

In the first guess, we had:
Position 1: C (x) -> not in word
Position 2: R (x) -> not in word
Position 3: A (x) -> not in word
Position 4: N (-) -> in word, but not at position 4
Position 5: E (-) -> in word, but not at position 5

Therefore, the secret word:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E, but not at the 4th and 5th positions respectively.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Must contain N and E (since they are present in the word).
- The N cannot be at position 4 and the E cannot be at position 5.

Also, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of possible words that include N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

We know N is in the word but not at position 4. So N can be at positions 1,2,3, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5.

Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so E can be at positions 1,2,3,4.

We also don't know the other letters. We have to guess 3 more letters.

We should try to cover common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried. We have used C,R,A,N,E. So we should try other common letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We have two known letters: N and E. We need to include them in the word, but in positions that are not forbidden.

Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

We also want to test other common letters.

Let me try to think of words that have N and E, and avoid C,R,A.

For example, words like ""SENT"", but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

5-letter words: 
- Let's try to put E in a new position, say position 1? But we don't know. We can try to put E in position 2 or 3 or 4.

Similarly, N can be in position 1,2,3,5.

But note: we don't want to put N in position 4 (already known wrong) and E in position 5 (known wrong).

Also, we must avoid C,R,A.

Let me list some words:

Option 1: ""NEEDS"" - but has two E's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, but note: if a letter appears twice, the feedback might be tricky. However, in the rules, it's not specified. But typically, if the secret word has two of the same letter, then the feedback will reflect that. But in our case, we don't have any duplicate in the feedback so far.

But we don't know the secret word. So we should avoid duplicates for now to get more information? Or it's okay.

But note: we have to use N and E. We don't know if the secret word has duplicates. So it's safe to assume no duplicates until we see evidence.

But the word ""NEEDS"" has two E's. We don't know if that's allowed. But the secret word might have duplicates? The example didn't have duplicates.

To be safe, let's try a word without duplicates.

Another word: ""LINEN"" - but that has two N's. Also, we don't know if L and I are in the word.

We need to test new letters.

Let me think of words that have E and N, and three new letters.

Common words: 
- ""STONE"": S, T, O, N, E -> avoids C,R,A. 
  - Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)
  But wait: we know that N cannot be at position 4 (from the feedback of the first guess: N was at position 4 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not at position 4). So if we put N at position 4 again, that would be invalid? Actually, we can put it, but we know it's not correct. But we are trying to get information about other positions.

However, we already know that position 4 is not N. So putting N at position 4 in this guess would be a waste because we know it's not there. Similarly, we know E is not at position 5.

So in ""STONE"", we are putting N at position 4 (which we know is wrong) and E at position 5 (which we know is wrong). So that would not be efficient.

We should avoid putting N at position 4 and E at position 5.

So let's choose a word where N is not at 4 and E is not at 5.

For example:
- Put E at position 1: words like ""E...N""
- Or E at position 2: ""?E..N"" or ""?E.?N"" etc.

Let me try to form a word.

Option: ""NOISE"" -> N, O, I, S, E
- Positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5)
But E is at position 5, which we know is wrong for E (because in the first guess, E was at 5 and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at 5). So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct. So we would get a '-' again for E at 5, which we already know. That doesn't give new information.

We want to test E in a new position. So we should avoid position 5 for E.

Similarly, avoid position 4 for N.

So in ""NOISE"", we have N at position 1 (which is new) and E at position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we are wasting the E position.

We need to put E in a position that is not 5. So positions 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, N in positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

Let me try to put E at position 1: E _ _ _ _

And we need to include N somewhere not at 4.

For example: ""E...N"" at the end? But then N would be at position 5.

So ""E _ _ _ N""

But we have three more letters to fill, and avoid C,R,A.

Words: ""ELDEN"" (but that has two E's? E at 1 and E at 4? No, ""ELDEN"" is E,L,D,E,N -> two E's. Not good for information.

""EVENT"" -> E,V,E,N,T -> two E's.

""EXIST"" -> E,X,I,S,T -> no N.

""EDGES"" -> E,D,G,E,S -> two E's.

""ENDOW"" -> E,N,D,O,W -> has N at position 2? 
Positions: E(1), N(2), D(3), O(4), W(5)
This word: 
- E at position 1 (new)
- N at position 2 (new) -> and we avoid position 4 for N and position 5 for E.

Also, it uses new letters: D, O, W.

So ""ENDOW"" is a valid word.

But note: we have N at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Another option: put E at position 2.

For example: ""?E?N?"" 

Words: ""SENT"" is 4 letters. 5 letters: ""LEMON"" -> L,E,M,O,N -> positions: L(1),E(2),M(3),O(4),N(5). 
This has E at 2 and N at 5 (which is allowed because we know N is not at 4, and 5 is new; and E is not at 5, but at 2 is new).

Also, avoids C,R,A.

""LEMON"" uses L, M, O.

Another word: ""BEING"" -> B,E,I,N,G -> positions: B(1),E(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). 
But N is at position 4, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

So ""LEMON"" seems better.

But we have to consider that we are testing new letters.

We have used: C,R,A,N,E in the first guess. Now we are going to use L,E,M,O,N in ""LEMON"". But note: E and N are repeated. But we are testing their positions.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat any letters from the first guess? But we have to include E and N, so we cannot avoid them.

But we can avoid using the same letters that were wrong (C,R,A) and use new ones.

So ""LEMON"" uses L, E, M, O, N. The letters L, M, O are new.

Similarly, ""ENDOW"" uses E, N, D, O, W. All except E and N are new.

Both are good.

Another common word: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E -> but that doesn't have N. We must include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include both N and E.

So words without N or E are invalid because we know the word has N and E.

Therefore, we must choose a word that contains both N and E.

Now, between ""ENDOW"" and ""LEMON"", which one?

""ENDOW"": E at 1, N at 2, D at 3, O at 4, W at 5.
- We test E at position 1 (which might be correct or not) and N at position 2 (might be correct or not). Also, we test D, O, W.

""LEMON"": L at 1, E at 2, M at 3, O at 4, N at 5.
- E at position 2 and N at position 5.

We don't know which positions are correct, so both are valid.

But note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and E at position 5. Now we are moving them to new positions.

We might also consider the frequency of letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

In ""ENDOW"", we are testing D, O, W.
In ""LEMON"", we are testing L, M, O.

O is common in both.

But M is less common than D? Or W? 

We can also consider ""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E -> positions: N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). 
But E is at position 5, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5). 
This has E at position 4 (which is new) and N at position 2 (new). 
Avoids C,R,A. 
Uses I, L, T which are common.

So ""INLET"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""SINCE"": but has C? We cannot use C because we know C is not in the word.

""MINCE"": has C and M? C is not allowed.

""ONCE"": 4 letters.

So ""INLET"" seems good: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

We are testing:
- N at position 2 (new)
- E at position 4 (new) -> but note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and got '-', meaning N is not at 4. But now we are putting E at position 4. That's allowed because E is a different letter.

We are testing positions 1,2,3,4,5 with new letters except for N and E.

Another word: ""UNSET"": U, N, S, E, T -> positions: U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5). Similar to ""INLET"".

But ""UNSET"" might be less common? ""INLET"" is more common.

We can also do ""STONE"" but with N not at 4 and E not at 5? How? ""STONE"" has N at 4 and E at 5, which we want to avoid.

We can rearrange: ""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: T(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
This has N at position 3 (new) and E at position 4 (new). 
Avoids C,R,A. 
Uses T, O, S.

This is a good candidate.

So now we have:
- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> N at 2, E at 4
- ""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> N at 3, E at 4
- ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> E at 2, N at 5
- ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W -> E at 1, N at 2

Which one to choose?

We want to maximize the number of new letters and common letters.

In ""TONES"", we have S and T which are very common.

In ""INLET"", we have T and L.

In ""LEMON"", we have L and M.

In ""ENDOW"", we have D and W (W is less common).

So ""TONES"" and ""INLET"" are better.

Between ""TONES"" and ""INLET"", which one?

""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: T(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5)
""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

Note: in ""TONES"", we are putting E at position 4. In the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong. But that doesn't directly say anything about E at position 4. It could be that position 4 is E? We don't know.

Similarly, in ""INLET"", we are putting E at position 4.

But we also note that in the first guess, position 4 was N and it was wrong, but that doesn't prevent position 4 from being E.

So both are valid.

I think ""TONES"" is a good choice because it has S and T which are very common.

Alternatively, we can choose ""SLATE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess: A was x). So ""SLATE"" has A, which is not allowed.

Similarly, ""CRATE"" has C and R and A, all not allowed.

So ""TONES"" is valid.

Let me confirm: T, O, N, E, S.

We are including N and E, and avoiding C,R,A.

We are putting N at position 3 (which is not 4) and E at position 4 (which is not 5). So we are testing new positions.

Therefore, I will go with ""TONES"".

But note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting E at position 4. That is acceptable because we are testing if E is at position 4.

Similarly, we are testing N at position 3.

So let's choose ""TONES"".

But wait, is ""TONES"" a valid word? Yes, it means musical tones.

Another option: ""STONE"" is the same as ""TONES"" but rearranged. ""STONE"" would be S,T,O,N,E -> but then N is at position 4, which we want to avoid. So ""STONE"" is not good because of position 4 for N.

But ""TONES"" has N at position 3 and E at position 4.

So ""TONES"" is better.

We can also consider ""SENT"" but it's 4 letters.

So I think ""TONES"" is a good second guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""TONES"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A not in the word; N and E in the word but in wrong positions), the second guess must:
- Include N and E (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid C, R, A (as they are not in the word).
- Place N in a position other than 4 (since it was wrong there in the first guess).
- Place E in a position other than 5 (since it was wrong there in the first guess).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""TONES"" is chosen because:
- It includes N (at position 3) and E (at position 4), both in new positions to test.
- It avoids C, R, A.
- It introduces new common letters: T, O, S (which are high-frequency and can help narrow down possibilities).
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>tones</guess>",tones,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: x (not in the word)
N: - (in the word but wrong position)
E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters N and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed.

In the first guess, we had:
Position 1: C (x) -> not in word
Position 2: R (x) -> not in word
Position 3: A (x) -> not in word
Position 4: N (-) -> in word, but not at position 4
Position 5: E (-) -> in word, but not at position 5

Therefore, the secret word:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E, but not at the 4th and 5th positions respectively.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Must contain N and E (since they are present in the word).
- The N cannot be at position 4 and the E cannot be at position 5.

Also, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of possible words that include N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

We know N is in the word but not at position 4. So N can be at positions 1,2,3, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5.

Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so E can be at positions 1,2,3,4.

We also don't know the other letters. We have to guess 3 more letters.

We should try to cover common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried. We have used C,R,A,N,E. So we should try other common letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We have two known letters: N and E. We need to include them in the word, but in positions that are not forbidden.

Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

We also want to test other common letters.

Let me try to think of words that have N and E, and avoid C,R,A.

For example, words like ""SENT"", but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

5-letter words: 
- Let's try to put E in a new position, say position 1? But we don't know. We can try to put E in position 2 or 3 or 4.

Similarly, N can be in position 1,2,3,5.

But note: we don't want to put N in position 4 (already known wrong) and E in position 5 (known wrong).

Also, we must avoid C,R,A.

Let me list some words:

Option 1: ""NEEDS"" - but has two E's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, but note: if a letter appears twice, the feedback might be tricky. However, in the rules, it's not specified. But typically, if the secret word has two of the same letter, then the feedback will reflect that. But in our case, we don't have any duplicate in the feedback so far.

But we don't know the secret word. So we should avoid duplicates for now to get more information? Or it's okay.

But note: we have to use N and E. We don't know if the secret word has duplicates. So it's safe to assume no duplicates until we see evidence.

But the word ""NEEDS"" has two E's. We don't know if that's allowed. But the secret word might have duplicates? The example didn't have duplicates.

To be safe, let's try a word without duplicates.

Another word: ""LINEN"" - but that has two N's. Also, we don't know if L and I are in the word.

We need to test new letters.

Let me think of words that have E and N, and three new letters.

Common words: 
- ""STONE"": S, T, O, N, E -> avoids C,R,A. 
  - Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)
  But wait: we know that N cannot be at position 4 (from the feedback of the first guess: N was at position 4 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not at position 4). So if we put N at position 4 again, that would be invalid? Actually, we can put it, but we know it's not correct. But we are trying to get information about other positions.

However, we already know that position 4 is not N. So putting N at position 4 in this guess would be a waste because we know it's not there. Similarly, we know E is not at position 5.

So in ""STONE"", we are putting N at position 4 (which we know is wrong) and E at position 5 (which we know is wrong). So that would not be efficient.

We should avoid putting N at position 4 and E at position 5.

So let's choose a word where N is not at 4 and E is not at 5.

For example:
- Put E at position 1: words like ""E...N""
- Or E at position 2: ""?E..N"" or ""?E.?N"" etc.

Let me try to form a word.

Option: ""NOISE"" -> N, O, I, S, E
- Positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5)
But E is at position 5, which we know is wrong for E (because in the first guess, E was at 5 and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at 5). So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct. So we would get a '-' again for E at 5, which we already know. That doesn't give new information.

We want to test E in a new position. So we should avoid position 5 for E.

Similarly, avoid position 4 for N.

So in ""NOISE"", we have N at position 1 (which is new) and E at position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we are wasting the E position.

We need to put E in a position that is not 5. So positions 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, N in positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

Let me try to put E at position 1: E _ _ _ _

And we need to include N somewhere not at 4.

For example: ""E...N"" at the end? But then N would be at position 5.

So ""E _ _ _ N""

But we have three more letters to fill, and avoid C,R,A.

Words: ""ELDEN"" (but that has two E's? E at 1 and E at 4? No, ""ELDEN"" is E,L,D,E,N -> two E's. Not good for information.

""EVENT"" -> E,V,E,N,T -> two E's.

""EXIST"" -> E,X,I,S,T -> no N.

""EDGES"" -> E,D,G,E,S -> two E's.

""ENDOW"" -> E,N,D,O,W -> has N at position 2? 
Positions: E(1), N(2), D(3), O(4), W(5)
This word: 
- E at position 1 (new)
- N at position 2 (new) -> and we avoid position 4 for N and position 5 for E.

Also, it uses new letters: D, O, W.

So ""ENDOW"" is a valid word.

But note: we have N at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Another option: put E at position 2.

For example: ""?E?N?"" 

Words: ""SENT"" is 4 letters. 5 letters: ""LEMON"" -> L,E,M,O,N -> positions: L(1),E(2),M(3),O(4),N(5). 
This has E at 2 and N at 5 (which is allowed because we know N is not at 4, and 5 is new; and E is not at 5, but at 2 is new).

Also, avoids C,R,A.

""LEMON"" uses L, M, O.

Another word: ""BEING"" -> B,E,I,N,G -> positions: B(1),E(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). 
But N is at position 4, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

So ""LEMON"" seems better.

But we have to consider that we are testing new letters.

We have used: C,R,A,N,E in the first guess. Now we are going to use L,E,M,O,N in ""LEMON"". But note: E and N are repeated. But we are testing their positions.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat any letters from the first guess? But we have to include E and N, so we cannot avoid them.

But we can avoid using the same letters that were wrong (C,R,A) and use new ones.

So ""LEMON"" uses L, E, M, O, N. The letters L, M, O are new.

Similarly, ""ENDOW"" uses E, N, D, O, W. All except E and N are new.

Both are good.

Another common word: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E -> but that doesn't have N. We must include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include both N and E.

So words without N or E are invalid because we know the word has N and E.

Therefore, we must choose a word that contains both N and E.

Now, between ""ENDOW"" and ""LEMON"", which one?

""ENDOW"": E at 1, N at 2, D at 3, O at 4, W at 5.
- We test E at position 1 (which might be correct or not) and N at position 2 (might be correct or not). Also, we test D, O, W.

""LEMON"": L at 1, E at 2, M at 3, O at 4, N at 5.
- E at position 2 and N at position 5.

We don't know which positions are correct, so both are valid.

But note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and E at position 5. Now we are moving them to new positions.

We might also consider the frequency of letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

In ""ENDOW"", we are testing D, O, W.
In ""LEMON"", we are testing L, M, O.

O is common in both.

But M is less common than D? Or W? 

We can also consider ""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E -> positions: N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). 
But E is at position 5, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5). 
This has E at position 4 (which is new) and N at position 2 (new). 
Avoids C,R,A. 
Uses I, L, T which are common.

So ""INLET"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""SINCE"": but has C? We cannot use C because we know C is not in the word.

""MINCE"": has C and M? C is not allowed.

""ONCE"": 4 letters.

So ""INLET"" seems good: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

We are testing:
- N at position 2 (new)
- E at position 4 (new) -> but note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and got '-', meaning N is not at 4. But now we are putting E at position 4. That's allowed because E is a different letter.

We are testing positions 1,2,3,4,5 with new letters except for N and E.

Another word: ""UNSET"": U, N, S, E, T -> positions: U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5). Similar to ""INLET"".

But ""UNSET"" might be less common? ""INLET"" is more common.

We can also do ""STONE"" but with N not at 4 and E not at 5? How? ""STONE"" has N at 4 and E at 5, which we want to avoid.

We can rearrange: ""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: T(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
This has N at position 3 (new) and E at position 4 (new). 
Avoids C,R,A. 
Uses T, O, S.

This is a good candidate.

So now we have:
- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> N at 2, E at 4
- ""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> N at 3, E at 4
- ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> E at 2, N at 5
- ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W -> E at 1, N at 2

Which one to choose?

We want to maximize the number of new letters and common letters.

In ""TONES"", we have S and T which are very common.

In ""INLET"", we have T and L.

In ""LEMON"", we have L and M.

In ""ENDOW"", we have D and W (W is less common).

So ""TONES"" and ""INLET"" are better.

Between ""TONES"" and ""INLET"", which one?

""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: T(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5)
""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

Note: in ""TONES"", we are putting E at position 4. In the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong. But that doesn't directly say anything about E at position 4. It could be that position 4 is E? We don't know.

Similarly, in ""INLET"", we are putting E at position 4.

But we also note that in the first guess, position 4 was N and it was wrong, but that doesn't prevent position 4 from being E.

So both are valid.

I think ""TONES"" is a good choice because it has S and T which are very common.

Alternatively, we can choose ""SLATE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess: A was x). So ""SLATE"" has A, which is not allowed.

Similarly, ""CRATE"" has C and R and A, all not allowed.

So ""TONES"" is valid.

Let me confirm: T, O, N, E, S.

We are including N and E, and avoiding C,R,A.

We are putting N at position 3 (which is not 4) and E at position 4 (which is not 5). So we are testing new positions.

Therefore, I will go with ""TONES"".

But note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting E at position 4. That is acceptable because we are testing if E is at position 4.

Similarly, we are testing N at position 3.

So let's choose ""TONES"".

But wait, is ""TONES"" a valid word? Yes, it means musical tones.

Another option: ""STONE"" is the same as ""TONES"" but rearranged. ""STONE"" would be S,T,O,N,E -> but then N is at position 4, which we want to avoid. So ""STONE"" is not good because of position 4 for N.

But ""TONES"" has N at position 3 and E at position 4.

So ""TONES"" is better.

We can also consider ""SENT"" but it's 4 letters.

So I think ""TONES"" is a good second guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""TONES"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A not in the word; N and E in the word but in wrong positions), the second guess must:
- Include N and E (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid C, R, A (as they are not in the word).
- Place N in a position other than 4 (since it was wrong there in the first guess).
- Place E in a position other than 5 (since it was wrong there in the first guess).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""TONES"" is chosen because:
- It includes N (at position 3) and E (at position 4), both in new positions to test.
- It avoids C, R, A.
- It introduces new common letters: T, O, S (which are high-frequency and can help narrow down possibilities).
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.",Guess 2: tones -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) N(-) E(-) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,endow,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and positions to maximize information.
 Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
 A good starting word is often ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Another popular one is ""ROATE"". However, let's choose one that has unique letters and covers common ones.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
   - All letters are distinct, so we get maximum information.

 But note: the problem does not require the word to have distinct letters, but having distinct letters is better for information.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a very good starting word because it has S, L, A, T, E which are all common.

 Since the problem does not specify any constraints on the word, I can choose any valid 5-letter word.

 Let me choose ""SLATE"" for the first guess.

 However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we are free to choose.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice. But let me check: in Wordle, ""CRANE"" is a good starter.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the cumulative return of an investment) is also used by some, but it might be less familiar.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 But wait, the problem says ""valid 5-letter English word"". We must ensure it's valid.

 Let me think of common words: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ADIEU"" (if we want many vowels). 

 I choose ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: x (not in the word)
N: - (in the word but wrong position)
E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters N and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed.

In the first guess, we had:
Position 1: C (x) -> not in word
Position 2: R (x) -> not in word
Position 3: A (x) -> not in word
Position 4: N (-) -> in word, but not at position 4
Position 5: E (-) -> in word, but not at position 5

Therefore, the secret word:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E, but not at the 4th and 5th positions respectively.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Must contain N and E (since they are present in the word).
- The N cannot be at position 4 and the E cannot be at position 5.

Also, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of possible words that include N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

We know N is in the word but not at position 4. So N can be at positions 1,2,3, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5.

Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so E can be at positions 1,2,3,4.

We also don't know the other letters. We have to guess 3 more letters.

We should try to cover common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried. We have used C,R,A,N,E. So we should try other common letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We have two known letters: N and E. We need to include them in the word, but in positions that are not forbidden.

Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

We also want to test other common letters.

Let me try to think of words that have N and E, and avoid C,R,A.

For example, words like ""SENT"", but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

5-letter words: 
- Let's try to put E in a new position, say position 1? But we don't know. We can try to put E in position 2 or 3 or 4.

Similarly, N can be in position 1,2,3,5.

But note: we don't want to put N in position 4 (already known wrong) and E in position 5 (known wrong).

Also, we must avoid C,R,A.

Let me list some words:

Option 1: ""NEEDS"" - but has two E's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, but note: if a letter appears twice, the feedback might be tricky. However, in the rules, it's not specified. But typically, if the secret word has two of the same letter, then the feedback will reflect that. But in our case, we don't have any duplicate in the feedback so far.

But we don't know the secret word. So we should avoid duplicates for now to get more information? Or it's okay.

But note: we have to use N and E. We don't know if the secret word has duplicates. So it's safe to assume no duplicates until we see evidence.

But the word ""NEEDS"" has two E's. We don't know if that's allowed. But the secret word might have duplicates? The example didn't have duplicates.

To be safe, let's try a word without duplicates.

Another word: ""LINEN"" - but that has two N's. Also, we don't know if L and I are in the word.

We need to test new letters.

Let me think of words that have E and N, and three new letters.

Common words: 
- ""STONE"": S, T, O, N, E -> avoids C,R,A. 
  - Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)
  But wait: we know that N cannot be at position 4 (from the feedback of the first guess: N was at position 4 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not at position 4). So if we put N at position 4 again, that would be invalid? Actually, we can put it, but we know it's not correct. But we are trying to get information about other positions.

However, we already know that position 4 is not N. So putting N at position 4 in this guess would be a waste because we know it's not there. Similarly, we know E is not at position 5.

So in ""STONE"", we are putting N at position 4 (which we know is wrong) and E at position 5 (which we know is wrong). So that would not be efficient.

We should avoid putting N at position 4 and E at position 5.

So let's choose a word where N is not at 4 and E is not at 5.

For example:
- Put E at position 1: words like ""E...N""
- Or E at position 2: ""?E..N"" or ""?E.?N"" etc.

Let me try to form a word.

Option: ""NOISE"" -> N, O, I, S, E
- Positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5)
But E is at position 5, which we know is wrong for E (because in the first guess, E was at 5 and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at 5). So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct. So we would get a '-' again for E at 5, which we already know. That doesn't give new information.

We want to test E in a new position. So we should avoid position 5 for E.

Similarly, avoid position 4 for N.

So in ""NOISE"", we have N at position 1 (which is new) and E at position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we are wasting the E position.

We need to put E in a position that is not 5. So positions 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, N in positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

Let me try to put E at position 1: E _ _ _ _

And we need to include N somewhere not at 4.

For example: ""E...N"" at the end? But then N would be at position 5.

So ""E _ _ _ N""

But we have three more letters to fill, and avoid C,R,A.

Words: ""ELDEN"" (but that has two E's? E at 1 and E at 4? No, ""ELDEN"" is E,L,D,E,N -> two E's. Not good for information.

""EVENT"" -> E,V,E,N,T -> two E's.

""EXIST"" -> E,X,I,S,T -> no N.

""EDGES"" -> E,D,G,E,S -> two E's.

""ENDOW"" -> E,N,D,O,W -> has N at position 2? 
Positions: E(1), N(2), D(3), O(4), W(5)
This word: 
- E at position 1 (new)
- N at position 2 (new) -> and we avoid position 4 for N and position 5 for E.

Also, it uses new letters: D, O, W.

So ""ENDOW"" is a valid word.

But note: we have N at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Another option: put E at position 2.

For example: ""?E?N?"" 

Words: ""SENT"" is 4 letters. 5 letters: ""LEMON"" -> L,E,M,O,N -> positions: L(1),E(2),M(3),O(4),N(5). 
This has E at 2 and N at 5 (which is allowed because we know N is not at 4, and 5 is new; and E is not at 5, but at 2 is new).

Also, avoids C,R,A.

""LEMON"" uses L, M, O.

Another word: ""BEING"" -> B,E,I,N,G -> positions: B(1),E(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). 
But N is at position 4, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

So ""LEMON"" seems better.

But we have to consider that we are testing new letters.

We have used: C,R,A,N,E in the first guess. Now we are going to use L,E,M,O,N in ""LEMON"". But note: E and N are repeated. But we are testing their positions.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat any letters from the first guess? But we have to include E and N, so we cannot avoid them.

But we can avoid using the same letters that were wrong (C,R,A) and use new ones.

So ""LEMON"" uses L, E, M, O, N. The letters L, M, O are new.

Similarly, ""ENDOW"" uses E, N, D, O, W. All except E and N are new.

Both are good.

Another common word: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E -> but that doesn't have N. We must include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include both N and E.

So words without N or E are invalid because we know the word has N and E.

Therefore, we must choose a word that contains both N and E.

Now, between ""ENDOW"" and ""LEMON"", which one?

""ENDOW"": E at 1, N at 2, D at 3, O at 4, W at 5.
- We test E at position 1 (which might be correct or not) and N at position 2 (might be correct or not). Also, we test D, O, W.

""LEMON"": L at 1, E at 2, M at 3, O at 4, N at 5.
- E at position 2 and N at position 5.

We don't know which positions are correct, so both are valid.

But note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and E at position 5. Now we are moving them to new positions.

We might also consider the frequency of letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

In ""ENDOW"", we are testing D, O, W.
In ""LEMON"", we are testing L, M, O.

O is common in both.

But M is less common than D? Or W? 

We can also consider ""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E -> positions: N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). 
But E is at position 5, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5). 
This has E at position 4 (which is new) and N at position 2 (new). 
Avoids C,R,A. 
Uses I, L, T which are common.

So ""INLET"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""SINCE"": but has C? We cannot use C because we know C is not in the word.

""MINCE"": has C and M? C is not allowed.

""ONCE"": 4 letters.

So ""INLET"" seems good: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

We are testing:
- N at position 2 (new)
- E at position 4 (new) -> but note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and got '-', meaning N is not at 4. But now we are putting E at position 4. That's allowed because E is a different letter.

We are testing positions 1,2,3,4,5 with new letters except for N and E.

Another word: ""UNSET"": U, N, S, E, T -> positions: U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5). Similar to ""INLET"".

But ""UNSET"" might be less common? ""INLET"" is more common.

We can also do ""STONE"" but with N not at 4 and E not at 5? How? ""STONE"" has N at 4 and E at 5, which we want to avoid.

We can rearrange: ""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: T(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
This has N at position 3 (new) and E at position 4 (new). 
Avoids C,R,A. 
Uses T, O, S.

This is a good candidate.

So now we have:
- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> N at 2, E at 4
- ""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> N at 3, E at 4
- ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> E at 2, N at 5
- ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W -> E at 1, N at 2

Which one to choose?

We want to maximize the number of new letters and common letters.

In ""TONES"", we have S and T which are very common.

In ""INLET"", we have T and L.

In ""LEMON"", we have L and M.

In ""ENDOW"", we have D and W (W is less common).

So ""TONES"" and ""INLET"" are better.

Between ""TONES"" and ""INLET"", which one?

""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: T(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5)
""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

Note: in ""TONES"", we are putting E at position 4. In the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong. But that doesn't directly say anything about E at position 4. It could be that position 4 is E? We don't know.

Similarly, in ""INLET"", we are putting E at position 4.

But we also note that in the first guess, position 4 was N and it was wrong, but that doesn't prevent position 4 from being E.

So both are valid.

I think ""TONES"" is a good choice because it has S and T which are very common.

Alternatively, we can choose ""SLATE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess: A was x). So ""SLATE"" has A, which is not allowed.

Similarly, ""CRATE"" has C and R and A, all not allowed.

So ""TONES"" is valid.

Let me confirm: T, O, N, E, S.

We are including N and E, and avoiding C,R,A.

We are putting N at position 3 (which is not 4) and E at position 4 (which is not 5). So we are testing new positions.

Therefore, I will go with ""TONES"".

But note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting E at position 4. That is acceptable because we are testing if E is at position 4.

Similarly, we are testing N at position 3.

So let's choose ""TONES"".

But wait, is ""TONES"" a valid word? Yes, it means musical tones.

Another option: ""STONE"" is the same as ""TONES"" but rearranged. ""STONE"" would be S,T,O,N,E -> but then N is at position 4, which we want to avoid. So ""STONE"" is not good because of position 4 for N.

But ""TONES"" has N at position 3 and E at position 4.

So ""TONES"" is better.

We can also consider ""SENT"" but it's 4 letters.

So I think ""TONES"" is a good second guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""TONES"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A not in the word; N and E in the word but in wrong positions), the second guess must:
- Include N and E (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid C, R, A (as they are not in the word).
- Place N in a position other than 4 (since it was wrong there in the first guess).
- Place E in a position other than 5 (since it was wrong there in the first guess).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""TONES"" is chosen because:
- It includes N (at position 3) and E (at position 4), both in new positions to test.
- It avoids C, R, A.
- It introduces new common letters: T, O, S (which are high-frequency and can help narrow down possibilities).
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

We can try to put E in position 2 or 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, N can be in position 1,2,3,5.\n\nBut note: we don\'t want to put N in position 4 (already known wrong) and E in position 5 (known wrong).\n\nAlso, we must avoid C,R,A.\n\nLet me list some words:\n\nOption 1: ""NEEDS"" - but has two E\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. The feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates, but note: if a letter appears twice, the feedback might be tricky. However, in the rules, it\'s not specified. But typically, if the secret word has two of the same letter, then the feedback will reflect that. But in our case, we don\'t have any duplicate in the feedback so far.\n\nBut we don\'t know the secret word. So we should avoid duplicates for now to get more information? Or it\'s okay.\n\nBut note: we have to use N and E. We don\'t know if the secret word has duplicates. So it\'s safe to assume no duplicates until we see evidence.\n\nBut the word ""NEEDS"" has two E\'s. We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. But the secret word might have duplicates? The example didn\'t have duplicates.\n\nTo be safe, let\'s try a word without duplicates.\n\nAnother word: ""LINEN"" - but that has two N\'s. Also, we don\'t know if L and I are in the word.\n\nWe need to test new letters.\n\nLet me think of words that have E and N, and three new letters.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""STONE"": S, T, O, N, E -> avoids C,R,A. \n  - Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)\n  But wait: we know that N cannot be at position 4 (from the feedback of the first guess: N was at position 4 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 4). So if we put N at position 4 again, that would be invalid? Actually, we can put it, but we know it\'s not correct. But we are trying to get information about other positions.\n\nHowever, we already know that position 4 is not N. So putting N at position 4 in this guess would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. Similarly, we know E is not at position 5.\n\nSo in ""STONE"", we are putting N at position 4 (which we know is wrong) and E at position 5 (which we know is wrong). So that would not be efficient.\n\nWe should avoid putting N at position 4 and E at position 5.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word where N is not at 4 and E is not at 5.\n\nFor example:\n- Put E at position 1: words like ""E...N""\n- Or E at position 2: ""?E..N"" or ""?E.?N"" etc.\n\nLet me try to form a word.\n\nOption: ""NOISE"" -> N, O, I, S, E\n- Positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5)\nBut E is at position 5, which we know is wrong for E (because in the first guess, E was at 5 and got \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not at 5). So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not correct. So we would get a \'-\' again for E at 5, which we already know. That doesn\'t give new information.\n\nWe want to test E in a new position. So we should avoid position 5 for E.\n\nSimilarly, avoid position 4 for N.\n\nSo in ""NOISE"", we have N at position 1 (which is new) and E at position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we are wasting the E position.\n\nWe need to put E in a position that is not 5. So positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, N in positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).\n\nLet me try to put E at position 1: E _ _ _ _\n\nAnd we need to include N somewhere not at 4.\n\nFor example: ""E...N"" at the end? But then N would be at position 5.\n\nSo ""E _ _ _ N""\n\nBut we have three more letters to fill, and avoid C,R,A.\n\nWords: ""ELDEN"" (but that has two E\'s? E at 1 and E at 4? No, ""ELDEN"" is E,L,D,E,N -> two E\'s. Not good for information.\n\n""EVENT"" -> E,V,E,N,T -> two E\'s.\n\n""EXIST"" -> E,X,I,S,T -> no N.\n\n""EDGES"" -> E,D,G,E,S -> two E\'s.\n\n""ENDOW"" -> E,N,D,O,W -> has N at position 2? \nPositions: E(1), N(2), D(3), O(4), W(5)\nThis word: \n- E at position 1 (new)\n- N at position 2 (new) -> and we avoid position 4 for N and position 5 for E.\n\nAlso, it uses new letters: D, O, W.\n\nSo ""ENDOW"" is a valid word.\n\nBut note: we have N at position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\nAnother option: put E at position 2.\n\nFor example: ""?E?N?"" \n\nWords: ""SENT"" is 4 letters. 5 letters: ""LEMON"" -> L,E,M,O,N -> positions: L(1),E(2),M(3),O(4),N(5). \nThis has E at 2 and N at 5 (which is allowed because we know N is not at 4, and 5 is new; and E is not at 5, but at 2 is new).\n\nAlso, avoids C,R,A.\n\n""LEMON"" uses L, M, O.\n\nAnother word: ""BEING"" -> B,E,I,N,G -> positions: B(1),E(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). \nBut N is at position 4, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\nSo ""LEMON"" seems better.\n\nBut we have to consider that we are testing new letters.\n\nWe have used: C,R,A,N,E in the first guess. Now we are going to use L,E,M,O,N in ""LEMON"". But note: E and N are repeated. But we are testing their positions.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t repeat any letters from the first guess? But we have to include E and N, so we cannot avoid them.\n\nBut we can avoid using the same letters that were wrong (C,R,A) and use new ones.\n\nSo ""LEMON"" uses L, E, M, O, N. The letters L, M, O are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""ENDOW"" uses E, N, D, O, W. All except E and N are new.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nAnother common word: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E -> but that doesn\'t have N. We must include N because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nWe must include both N and E.\n\nSo words without N or E are invalid because we know the word has N and E.\n\nTherefore, we must choose a word that contains both N and E.\n\nNow, between ""ENDOW"" and ""LEMON"", which one?\n\n""ENDOW"": E at 1, N at 2, D at 3, O at 4, W at 5.\n- We test E at position 1 (which might be correct or not) and N at position 2 (might be correct or not). Also, we test D, O, W.\n\n""LEMON"": L at 1, E at 2, M at 3, O at 4, N at 5.\n- E at position 2 and N at position 5.\n\nWe don\'t know which positions are correct, so both are valid.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and E at position 5. Now we are moving them to new positions.\n\nWe might also consider the frequency of letters.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\nIn ""ENDOW"", we are testing D, O, W.\nIn ""LEMON"", we are testing L, M, O.\n\nO is common in both.\n\nBut M is less common than D? Or W? \n\nWe can also consider ""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E -> positions: N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). \nBut E is at position 5, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.\n\n""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5). \nThis has E at position 4 (which is new) and N at position 2 (new). \nAvoids C,R,A. \nUses I, L, T which are common.\n\nSo ""INLET"" is a good candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""SINCE"": but has C? We cannot use C because we know C is not in the word.\n\n""MINCE"": has C and M? C is not allowed.\n\n""ONCE"": 4 letters.\n\nSo ""INLET"" seems good: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)\n\nWe are testing:\n- N at position 2 (new)\n- E at position 4 (new) -> but note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and got \'-\', meaning N is not at 4. But now we are putting E at position 4. That\'s allowed because E is a different letter.\n\nWe are testing positions 1,2,3,4,5 with new letters except for N and E.\n\nAnother word: ""UNSET"": U, N, S, E, T -> positions: U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5). Similar to ""INLET"".\n\nBut ""UNSET"" might be less common? ""INLET"" is more common.\n\nWe can also do ""STONE"" but with N not at 4 and E not at 5? How? ""STONE"" has N at 4 and E at 5, which we want to avoid.\n\nWe can rearrange: ""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: T(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \nThis has N at position 3 (new) and E at position 4 (new). \nAvoids C,R,A. \nUses T, O, S.\n\nThis is a good candidate.\n\nSo now we have:\n- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> N at 2, E at 4\n- ""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> N at 3, E at 4\n- ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> E at 2, N at 5\n- ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W -> E at 1, N at 2\n\nWhich one to choose?\n\nWe want to maximize the number of new letters and common letters.\n\nIn ""TONES"", we have S and T which are very common.\n\nIn ""INLET"", we have T and L.\n\nIn ""LEMON"", we have L and M.\n\nIn ""ENDOW"", we have D and W (W is less common).\n\nSo ""TONES"" and ""INLET"" are better.\n\nBetween ""TONES"" and ""INLET"", which one?\n\n""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: T(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5)\n""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)\n\nNote: in ""TONES"", we are putting E at position 4.

First, I need to review the feedback from previous guesses to understand what we know about the secret word.

From Guess 1 (""crane""):  
- C(x) - not in the word  
- R(x) - not in the word  
- A(x) - not in the word  
- N(-) - in the word but not at position 4  
- E(-) - in the word but not at position 5  

So, we know:  
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A  
- Letters in the word: N and E, but not at specific positions: N is not at position 4, and E is not at position 5.

From Guess 2 (""tones""):  
- T(x) - not in the word  
- O(-) - in the word but not at position 2  
- N(-) - in the word but not at position 3 (since N is repeated, but feedback depends on position)  
- E(-) - in the word but not at position 4  
- S(x) - not in the word  

In ""tones"", positions are:  
1. T  
2. O  
3. N  
4. E  
5. S  

Feedback:  
- T(x) - T not in the word  
- O(-) - O in the word, but not at position 2  
- N(-) - N in the word, but not at position 3  
- E(-) - E in the word, but not at position 4  
- S(x) - S not in the word  

Combining all information:

Letters not in the word: C, R, A (from guess 1), T (from guess 2), S (from guess 2). So definitely not present: A, C, R, S, T.

Letters in the word:  
- N is in the word, but not at position 4 (from guess 1) and not at position 3 (from guess 2).  
- E is in the word, but not at position 5 (from guess 1) and not at position 4 (from guess 2).  
- O is in the word, but not at position 2 (from guess 2).

We also have positions where letters are incorrect. Specifically for N and E:

- N cannot be at position 3 or 4. Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 5.  
- E cannot be at position 4 or 5. Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3.  
- O cannot be at position 2. Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but we need to consider overall constraints).

The word has five positions. We know N, E, and O are in the word, and likely other letters since we have three confirmed letters.

List of known present letters: N, E, O.

Absent letters: A, C, R, S, T.

From feedback, O is in the word but not position 2.

E is in the word but not position 4 or 5, so E must be at position 1, 2, or 3.

N is in the word but not position 3 or 4, so N must be at position 1, 2, or 5.

Since we have multiple present letters, and positions to assign.

Also, in guess 2, N was at position 3 and E at position 4, but both got ""-"" meaning they are not at those positions; but since we already knew N wasn't at position 4 and E not at position 5, the new info is that N isn't at position 3 and E isn't at position 4.

Now, for the next guess, we need to make a word that uses N, E, O, and two new letters, but avoiding the absent letters.

Possible letters to try: common consonants like L, M, P, D, etc., or vowels like I, U, but we need English words.

We should aim to test possible positions for N and E.

For example, E can be at 1,2,3; N at 1,2,5.

But position 1 can't be both E and N, so we need to cover different cases.

Also, O is somewhere not at position 2.

The secret word must have exactly these letters: at least N, E, O, and two more letters that are not A,C,R,S,T.

In feedback, for guess 2, O got ""-"" at position 2, meaning O is in the word but position is wrong.

Now, let's think of possible words that fit the constraints.

First, E must be in positions 1,2,3; N in 1,2,5; O can be anywhere except 2.

But position conflict: if N is at 1, E can't be at 1, similarly if E at 1, N can't be at 1, etc.

Possible combinations:

- If E at position 1, then N can be at 2 or 5 (since position 1 taken).  
- If E at position 2, then N can be at 1 or 5 (position 2 taken, and position 3 not possible for N).  
- If E at position 3, then N can be at 1,2, or 5.

O can be wherever not taken and not position 2.

Then the remaining two letters need to be filled.

Since we don't know the other two letters, we should choose a word that tests common letters and positions.

For instance, we could try to place E at position 1 to see if it's correct.

Similarly for N at position 5 or 1.

Let's think of candidate words.

First, ensure we include all known present letters: N, E, O must be in the word. We aren't 100% sure there are only three, but based on feedback so far, no indication of more than three, but there could be other letters. In guess 1 and guess 2, we have three ""-"" but that might correspond to the three letters, or there could be more. Actually, in guess 1, two ""-"" for N and E, in guess 2 three ""-"" for O, N, E. Guess 2 had O, N, E all getting ""-"" or possible duplicates, but in this case all distinct, so likely the word has O in addition.

In guess 1: N and E are present.

Guess 2: O, N, E are present, and N/E again confirm they are present.

So the secret word contains N, E, O, and two other letters not from A,C,R,S,T.

The two other letters are unknown; we need to discover them.

So for the next guess, we should include N, E, O, and two new letters, say from common ones: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, etc.

Also, we need to avoid placing E at positions 4 or 5, N at positions 3 or 4, and O not at position 2.

But in the guess, we can place them in possible positions to test.

For example, let's try E at position 1.

If E is at position 1, then it could be correct or not. But since it must be at 1,2,3, placing at 1 tests that.

Similarly, N could be at 1,2, or 5; but if E is at 1, N cannot be at 1, so N at 2 or 5.

O not at position 2.

So if E is at position 1, then word: E _ _ _ _

N must be included, at position 2 or 5.

If N at position 2: E N _ _ _

Then O cannot be at position 2 since it's taken by N, so O at 3,4,5, but position 2 is taken, so O at 3,4,5.

Now fill the blanks.

For example: E N O _ _ but that might not be valid, like ""ENOL"" is not a common word.

""ENO L"" with L? ""ENOLS"" is a word? ""Enols"" is chemical, but might be accepted.

Better choose common words.

E at 1, N at 5: E _ _ _ N

Then O at 2,3,4 but not at 2? If O at position 2, feedback said O not at position 2, so O cannot be at 2.

So if E at 1, and N at 5, then O must be at 3 or 4.

Position 2 needs a letter.

Say E _ O _ N, with O at 3, and _ at 2 and 4.

But position 4: if we put a letter there.

Word: E X O Y N

We need to choose X and Y, not from absent letters.

Absent: A,C,R,S,T.

Possible letters: say I and L, ""ELOIN"" E L O I N, but ""ELOIN"" means to enclose, not very common.

""EX CON"" but not 5 letters.

Difficult if N is at 5.

Perhaps put E at position 3.

Try E at position 3: then word: _ _ E _ _

N at position 1,2, or 5.

O not at position 2.

For example, N at position 1: N _ E _ _

Then O not at position 2, so O at position 4 or 5.

Position 2 needs a letter, position 4 or 5 O.

Say N X E Y O or N X E O Y .

If O at position 4: N X E O _

Or O at position 5: N X E _ O

Fill with letters.

Common words: ""N I E L O"" not a word.

""NA EVO"" no.

""NOBEL"": N O B E L

Positions: N(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), L(5)

But O is at position 2? But feedback said O cannot be at position 2. In guess 2, O was at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning O not at position 2. So we cannot place O at position 2.

In ""NOBEL"", O is at position 2, which is forbidden.

So if we try ""NOBEL"", O at position 2 would be wrong, so we know it would get ""-"", but we already know that.

But we want to test new letter positions.

So avoid position 2 for O.

Similarly, E cannot be at position 4, but in ""NOBEL"", E is at position 4, which is also forbidden based on previous feedback (in guess 2, E at position E got ""-"", so not at position 4).

In guess 2, E was at position 4 and got ""-"", so E not at position 4.

So for E, positions 1,2,3 possible.

For E in ""NOBEL"" at position 4, which is not allowed, so it would be incorrect.

We need a word where E is not at 4 or 5, N not at 3 or 4, O not at 2.

Let's list possible words.

Example: ""LEMON"" - L E M O N

Positions: L(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5)

Now check constraints:

E is at position 2 - this is possible, since E can be at 1,2,3.

N is at position 5 - possible, since N can be at 1,2,5.

O is at position 4 - possible.

But letters: L, E, M, O, N. We have E, N, O, and new L and M.

Absent letters: A,C,R,S,T not used, good.

Position for E: position 2, which is ok.

Position for N: position 5, ok.

Position for O: position 4, not position 2, ok.

""LEMON"" is a common word.

Perhaps ""DEMON"" - D E M O N

Positions: D(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5)

Similar to above, E at 2, N at 5, O at 4.

Good.

Another option: ""OVEN"" is 4 letters.

"" ONSET"" but S is absent, S is not in the word, from guess 2 S(x), so S is not in the word. So ""ONSET"" has S, not allowed.

"" INLET"" but T is absent? T is not in the word, from guess 2 T(x), so T not in word. ""INLET"" has T, not allowed.

""NOIS E"" has S, not allowed.

""LOVES"" has S, not allowed.

""MONTE"" has T, not allowed.

So ""LEMON"" or ""DEMON"" seem good.

""BONEY"" - B O N E Y, positions: B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5)

E at position 4? But E cannot be at position 4, from feedback. E not at position 4. So this is not good.

"" POUND"" - P O U N D, positions: P(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5)

N at position 4? But N cannot be at position 4, from feedback. So not good.

"" NEIGH"" - N E I G H, positions: N(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), H(5)

N at position 1, E at position 2, both ok, O not included? But O must be in the word, from feedback.

""NEIGH"" does not have O, but we know O is in the word, so it would be an invalid guess because it misses O.

We must include O, as it is present.

Similarly, must include N and E.

So possible words like ""LEMON"", ""DEMON"", or "" HONEY"" but H O N E Y positions: H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) — O at position 2, but O cannot be at position 2, and E at position 4, not allowed.

O at position 2 is forbidden.

So avoid that.

""DOZEN"" - D O Z E N, positions: D(1), O(2), Z(3), E(4), N(5) — O at position 2 forbidden, E at position 4 forbidden.

Not good.

""OUNCE"" but C is absent, C not in word, and E at position 5? E not at position 5.

""OUNCE"" has C and E at 5, not good.

""CLONE"" has C and L, C not allowed.

So back to ""LEMON"" or ""DEMON"".

""ONION"" has O and N, but no E? Must have E, so not.

""OPINE"" O P I N E, positions: O(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5)

N at position 4 forbidden, E at position 5 forbidden? E not at position 5, but position 5 here is E, which is not allowed.

E cannot be at position 5.

So not good.

""ALONE"" has A, absent.

Better to stick with ""LEMON"" or ""DEMON"".

Another word: ""MINER"" has M,I,N,E,R but R is absent.

R not in word.

""HOMED"" H O M E D, positions: H(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), D(5) — O at position 2 forbidden, E at position 4 forbidden.

""MODEL"" has O but no E or N? Must include E and N.

""DOE N"" not 5 letters separately.

"" DON E N"" not.

Perhaps ""DIODE"" has O and E but no N.

""DENIM"" D E N I M, positions: D(1), E(2), N(3), I(4), M(5)

N at position 3? But N cannot be at position 3, from guess 2 feedback. In guess 2, N was at position 3 and got ""-"", so not at position 3.

So here N at position 3 is not allowed.

E at position 2 is ok.

But N not at position 3.

Similarly, O not included? ""DENIM"" has no O.

Must have O.

So invalid.

""ENJOY"" E N J O Y, positions: E(1), N(2), J(3), O(4), Y(5)

This could work: E at 1, N at 2 (positions ok), O at 4 (ok, not position 2).

Letters: E,N,J,O,Y — J is not common, but possible.

Better to use more common letters.

""BEVUE"" not word.

So ""LEMON"" seems good: L E M O N, with E at position 2, O at position 4, N at position 5.

Position 4: O, and we don't have constraint against O at position 4, only not at 2.

Position 5: N, which is allowed for N since positions 1,2,5 possible.

Position 2: E, possible.

Similarly, ""DEMON"": D E M O N, same positions.

""MOON"" 4 letters.

""NOBLE"" has N O B L E, positions: N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5)

O at position 2 — forbidden, E at position 5 — forbidden (E not at position 5).

Not good.

""NOISY"" has S, absent.

So I think ""LEMON"" is a solid choice.

We could try E at position 3.

For example: "" M E L O N"" but M E L O N is not a word, ""MELON"" M E L O N? Positions: M(1), E(2), L(3), O(4), N(5)

E at position 2, not 3.

""LINE O"" not.

"" O L E N D"" not word.

""FIELD"" has F I E L D, no O.

""PILOT"" has P I L O T, T absent, and no E or N.

Must include E and N.

""NE O N"" has two N, ""NEONS"" S absent.

Not.

So ""LEMON"" or similar.

Another common word: ""PHONE"" has P H O N E, positions: P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)

N at position 4 forbidden, E at position 5 forbidden.

Not good.

""SHONE"" has S and H, S absent.

So I'll go with ""LEMON"" for the next guess.

But in ""LEMON"", E is at position 2, which we don't know if it can be or not, but it's a possible position.

Similarly, N at position 5.

O at position 4.

By guessing ""LEMON"", we can get feedback on these positions and also on M and L.

If E is correct at position 2, we get a ✓, etc.

Now, confirm the state.

Also, we have used letters so far: from guess 1: C,R,A,N,E; guess 2: T,O,N,E,S.

N and E repeated.

Now guessing L,E,M,O,N — L, M new.

If any of L or M are in the word, we'll know.

If not, we eliminate them.

So it's a good guess.

### Step-by-Step Thought Process

To make an informed third guess, I need to consolidate all information from the previous feedback and deduce possible constraints for the secret word.

**Information from Previous Feedback:**

1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)**
   - Letters **not** in the word: C, R, A.
   - Letters **in** the word but wrong positions: N (not position 4), E (not position 5).
   - This gives us two confirmed letters: N and E, with positional constraints.

2. **Guess 2: ""tones"" → Feedback: T(x) O(-) N(-) E(-) S(x)**
   - Letters **not** in the word: T, S (adding to the absent list from Guess 1).
   - Letters **in** the word but wrong positions: 
     - O (not position 2),
     - N (not position 3, as it was in position 3 here and got '-'),
     - E (not position 4, as it was in position 4 here and got '-').
   - This confirms O is in the word and refines positional constraints for N and E.

**Consolidated Constraints:**

- **Absent Letters:** A, C, R, S, T (totally excluded).
- **Present Letters:** N, E, O (must be included in the guess).
- **Positional Constraints:**
  - N: Cannot be at position 3 or 4, so possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.
  - E: Cannot be at position 4 or 5, so possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.
  - O: Cannot be at position 2, so possible positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- The secret word has 5 letters, with N, E, O confirmed, meaning there are two additional unknown letters (not absent, so must be from the remaining alphabet).
- There are no indications of duplicate letters yet, so the word might have all unique letters, but this is not confirmed.

**Strategy for Third Guess:**
- **Must Include:** N, E, O (to test their positions).
- **Must Avoid:** Absent letters (A, C, R, S, T) and positions where we know N, E, or O can't be.
- **Aim:** Test new common letters to gather more information—ideal candidates are high-frequency consonants like L, M, D, P, or vowels like I, U, but should form a valid English word.
- **Position Planning:** 
  - E is likely at position 1, 2, or 3.
  - N is likely at position 1, 2, or 5.
  - O is likely at any position except 2.
  - Avoid conflicts where positions overlap (e.g., positions 1 and 2 can't hold both N and E if they share the same spot).
- Given the constraints, a suitable word could place E at position 2 (a possible and common spot), N at position 5 (to test if it's the last letter), O at position 4 (avoiding position 2), and introduce new letters like L and M.

**Evaluating Candidate Words:**
- Consider ""lemon"" (L, E, M, O, N):
  - Positions: E at 2 (valid), O at 4 (valid, not 2), N at 5 (valid, not 3 or 4).
  - Contains N, E, O correctly.
  - New letters: L and M (common; if they are absent, we eliminate them; if present, we learn their status).
  - Valid word: ""lemon"" is a common English word for a fruit.
- Other candidates like ""demon"" (D, E, M, O, N) are also possible but ""lemon"" is chosen to prioritize common letters and avoid less familiar ones. Words like ""melon"" (M, E, L, O, N) are similar but E is at position 2 in both, so equivalent.
- Avoid words like ""noise"" (has S, absent), ""bones"" (has S, absent), or ""honey"" (O at position 2 forbidden).

**Why ""lemon""?**
- Tests E at position 2: If correct (✓), we lock position 2; if incorrect (-), we know E is still elsewhere (position 1 or 3).
- Tests N at position 5: Similarly, informs if N is last.
- Tests O at position 4: New position, could be correct or not.
- Introduces L and M: If either is in the word, we get positional feedback; if absent (x), we eliminate them.
- Overall, this maximizes information on positions and new letters while adhering to all constraints.

<guess>lemon</guess>",lemon,"First, I need to review the feedback from previous guesses to understand what we know about the secret word.

From Guess 1 (""crane""):  
- C(x) - not in the word  
- R(x) - not in the word  
- A(x) - not in the word  
- N(-) - in the word but not at position 4  
- E(-) - in the word but not at position 5  

So, we know:  
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A  
- Letters in the word: N and E, but not at specific positions: N is not at position 4, and E is not at position 5.

From Guess 2 (""tones""):  
- T(x) - not in the word  
- O(-) - in the word but not at position 2  
- N(-) - in the word but not at position 3 (since N is repeated, but feedback depends on position)  
- E(-) - in the word but not at position 4  
- S(x) - not in the word  

In ""tones"", positions are:  
1. T  
2. O  
3. N  
4. E  
5. S  

Feedback:  
- T(x) - T not in the word  
- O(-) - O in the word, but not at position 2  
- N(-) - N in the word, but not at position 3  
- E(-) - E in the word, but not at position 4  
- S(x) - S not in the word  

Combining all information:

Letters not in the word: C, R, A (from guess 1), T (from guess 2), S (from guess 2). So definitely not present: A, C, R, S, T.

Letters in the word:  
- N is in the word, but not at position 4 (from guess 1) and not at position 3 (from guess 2).  
- E is in the word, but not at position 5 (from guess 1) and not at position 4 (from guess 2).  
- O is in the word, but not at position 2 (from guess 2).

We also have positions where letters are incorrect. Specifically for N and E:

- N cannot be at position 3 or 4. Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 5.  
- E cannot be at position 4 or 5. Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3.  
- O cannot be at position 2. Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but we need to consider overall constraints).

The word has five positions. We know N, E, and O are in the word, and likely other letters since we have three confirmed letters.

List of known present letters: N, E, O.

Absent letters: A, C, R, S, T.

From feedback, O is in the word but not position 2.

E is in the word but not position 4 or 5, so E must be at position 1, 2, or 3.

N is in the word but not position 3 or 4, so N must be at position 1, 2, or 5.

Since we have multiple present letters, and positions to assign.

Also, in guess 2, N was at position 3 and E at position 4, but both got ""-"" meaning they are not at those positions; but since we already knew N wasn't at position 4 and E not at position 5, the new info is that N isn't at position 3 and E isn't at position 4.

Now, for the next guess, we need to make a word that uses N, E, O, and two new letters, but avoiding the absent letters.

Possible letters to try: common consonants like L, M, P, D, etc., or vowels like I, U, but we need English words.

We should aim to test possible positions for N and E.

For example, E can be at 1,2,3; N at 1,2,5.

But position 1 can't be both E and N, so we need to cover different cases.

Also, O is somewhere not at position 2.

The secret word must have exactly these letters: at least N, E, O, and two more letters that are not A,C,R,S,T.

In feedback, for guess 2, O got ""-"" at position 2, meaning O is in the word but position is wrong.

Now, let's think of possible words that fit the constraints.

First, E must be in positions 1,2,3; N in 1,2,5; O can be anywhere except 2.

But position conflict: if N is at 1, E can't be at 1, similarly if E at 1, N can't be at 1, etc.

Possible combinations:

- If E at position 1, then N can be at 2 or 5 (since position 1 taken).  
- If E at position 2, then N can be at 1 or 5 (position 2 taken, and position 3 not possible for N).  
- If E at position 3, then N can be at 1,2, or 5.

O can be wherever not taken and not position 2.

Then the remaining two letters need to be filled.

Since we don't know the other two letters, we should choose a word that tests common letters and positions.

For instance, we could try to place E at position 1 to see if it's correct.

Similarly for N at position 5 or 1.

Let's think of candidate words.

First, ensure we include all known present letters: N, E, O must be in the word. We aren't 100% sure there are only three, but based on feedback so far, no indication of more than three, but there could be other letters. In guess 1 and guess 2, we have three ""-"" but that might correspond to the three letters, or there could be more. Actually, in guess 1, two ""-"" for N and E, in guess 2 three ""-"" for O, N, E. Guess 2 had O, N, E all getting ""-"" or possible duplicates, but in this case all distinct, so likely the word has O in addition.

In guess 1: N and E are present.

Guess 2: O, N, E are present, and N/E again confirm they are present.

So the secret word contains N, E, O, and two other letters not from A,C,R,S,T.

The two other letters are unknown; we need to discover them.

So for the next guess, we should include N, E, O, and two new letters, say from common ones: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, etc.

Also, we need to avoid placing E at positions 4 or 5, N at positions 3 or 4, and O not at position 2.

But in the guess, we can place them in possible positions to test.

For example, let's try E at position 1.

If E is at position 1, then it could be correct or not. But since it must be at 1,2,3, placing at 1 tests that.

Similarly, N could be at 1,2, or 5; but if E is at 1, N cannot be at 1, so N at 2 or 5.

O not at position 2.

So if E is at position 1, then word: E _ _ _ _

N must be included, at position 2 or 5.

If N at position 2: E N _ _ _

Then O cannot be at position 2 since it's taken by N, so O at 3,4,5, but position 2 is taken, so O at 3,4,5.

Now fill the blanks.

For example: E N O _ _ but that might not be valid, like ""ENOL"" is not a common word.

""ENO L"" with L? ""ENOLS"" is a word? ""Enols"" is chemical, but might be accepted.

Better choose common words.

E at 1, N at 5: E _ _ _ N

Then O at 2,3,4 but not at 2? If O at position 2, feedback said O not at position 2, so O cannot be at 2.

So if E at 1, and N at 5, then O must be at 3 or 4.

Position 2 needs a letter.

Say E _ O _ N, with O at 3, and _ at 2 and 4.

But position 4: if we put a letter there.

Word: E X O Y N

We need to choose X and Y, not from absent letters.

Absent: A,C,R,S,T.

Possible letters: say I and L, ""ELOIN"" E L O I N, but ""ELOIN"" means to enclose, not very common.

""EX CON"" but not 5 letters.

Difficult if N is at 5.

Perhaps put E at position 3.

Try E at position 3: then word: _ _ E _ _

N at position 1,2, or 5.

O not at position 2.

For example, N at position 1: N _ E _ _

Then O not at position 2, so O at position 4 or 5.

Position 2 needs a letter, position 4 or 5 O.

Say N X E Y O or N X E O Y .

If O at position 4: N X E O _

Or O at position 5: N X E _ O

Fill with letters.

Common words: ""N I E L O"" not a word.

""NA EVO"" no.

""NOBEL"": N O B E L

Positions: N(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), L(5)

But O is at position 2? But feedback said O cannot be at position 2. In guess 2, O was at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning O not at position 2. So we cannot place O at position 2.

In ""NOBEL"", O is at position 2, which is forbidden.

So if we try ""NOBEL"", O at position 2 would be wrong, so we know it would get ""-"", but we already know that.

But we want to test new letter positions.

So avoid position 2 for O.

Similarly, E cannot be at position 4, but in ""NOBEL"", E is at position 4, which is also forbidden based on previous feedback (in guess 2, E at position E got ""-"", so not at position 4).

In guess 2, E was at position 4 and got ""-"", so E not at position 4.

So for E, positions 1,2,3 possible.

For E in ""NOBEL"" at position 4, which is not allowed, so it would be incorrect.

We need a word where E is not at 4 or 5, N not at 3 or 4, O not at 2.

Let's list possible words.

Example: ""LEMON"" - L E M O N

Positions: L(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5)

Now check constraints:

E is at position 2 - this is possible, since E can be at 1,2,3.

N is at position 5 - possible, since N can be at 1,2,5.

O is at position 4 - possible.

But letters: L, E, M, O, N. We have E, N, O, and new L and M.

Absent letters: A,C,R,S,T not used, good.

Position for E: position 2, which is ok.

Position for N: position 5, ok.

Position for O: position 4, not position 2, ok.

""LEMON"" is a common word.

Perhaps ""DEMON"" - D E M O N

Positions: D(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5)

Similar to above, E at 2, N at 5, O at 4.

Good.

Another option: ""OVEN"" is 4 letters.

"" ONSET"" but S is absent, S is not in the word, from guess 2 S(x), so S is not in the word. So ""ONSET"" has S, not allowed.

"" INLET"" but T is absent? T is not in the word, from guess 2 T(x), so T not in word. ""INLET"" has T, not allowed.

""NOIS E"" has S, not allowed.

""LOVES"" has S, not allowed.

""MONTE"" has T, not allowed.

So ""LEMON"" or ""DEMON"" seem good.

""BONEY"" - B O N E Y, positions: B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5)

E at position 4? But E cannot be at position 4, from feedback. E not at position 4. So this is not good.

"" POUND"" - P O U N D, positions: P(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5)

N at position 4? But N cannot be at position 4, from feedback. So not good.

"" NEIGH"" - N E I G H, positions: N(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), H(5)

N at position 1, E at position 2, both ok, O not included? But O must be in the word, from feedback.

""NEIGH"" does not have O, but we know O is in the word, so it would be an invalid guess because it misses O.

We must include O, as it is present.

Similarly, must include N and E.

So possible words like ""LEMON"", ""DEMON"", or "" HONEY"" but H O N E Y positions: H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) — O at position 2, but O cannot be at position 2, and E at position 4, not allowed.

O at position 2 is forbidden.

So avoid that.

""DOZEN"" - D O Z E N, positions: D(1), O(2), Z(3), E(4), N(5) — O at position 2 forbidden, E at position 4 forbidden.

Not good.

""OUNCE"" but C is absent, C not in word, and E at position 5? E not at position 5.

""OUNCE"" has C and E at 5, not good.

""CLONE"" has C and L, C not allowed.

So back to ""LEMON"" or ""DEMON"".

""ONION"" has O and N, but no E? Must have E, so not.

""OPINE"" O P I N E, positions: O(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5)

N at position 4 forbidden, E at position 5 forbidden? E not at position 5, but position 5 here is E, which is not allowed.

E cannot be at position 5.

So not good.

""ALONE"" has A, absent.

Better to stick with ""LEMON"" or ""DEMON"".

Another word: ""MINER"" has M,I,N,E,R but R is absent.

R not in word.

""HOMED"" H O M E D, positions: H(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), D(5) — O at position 2 forbidden, E at position 4 forbidden.

""MODEL"" has O but no E or N? Must include E and N.

""DOE N"" not 5 letters separately.

"" DON E N"" not.

Perhaps ""DIODE"" has O and E but no N.

""DENIM"" D E N I M, positions: D(1), E(2), N(3), I(4), M(5)

N at position 3? But N cannot be at position 3, from guess 2 feedback. In guess 2, N was at position 3 and got ""-"", so not at position 3.

So here N at position 3 is not allowed.

E at position 2 is ok.

But N not at position 3.

Similarly, O not included? ""DENIM"" has no O.

Must have O.

So invalid.

""ENJOY"" E N J O Y, positions: E(1), N(2), J(3), O(4), Y(5)

This could work: E at 1, N at 2 (positions ok), O at 4 (ok, not position 2).

Letters: E,N,J,O,Y — J is not common, but possible.

Better to use more common letters.

""BEVUE"" not word.

So ""LEMON"" seems good: L E M O N, with E at position 2, O at position 4, N at position 5.

Position 4: O, and we don't have constraint against O at position 4, only not at 2.

Position 5: N, which is allowed for N since positions 1,2,5 possible.

Position 2: E, possible.

Similarly, ""DEMON"": D E M O N, same positions.

""MOON"" 4 letters.

""NOBLE"" has N O B L E, positions: N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5)

O at position 2 — forbidden, E at position 5 — forbidden (E not at position 5).

Not good.

""NOISY"" has S, absent.

So I think ""LEMON"" is a solid choice.

We could try E at position 3.

For example: "" M E L O N"" but M E L O N is not a word, ""MELON"" M E L O N? Positions: M(1), E(2), L(3), O(4), N(5)

E at position 2, not 3.

""LINE O"" not.

"" O L E N D"" not word.

""FIELD"" has F I E L D, no O.

""PILOT"" has P I L O T, T absent, and no E or N.

Must include E and N.

""NE O N"" has two N, ""NEONS"" S absent.

Not.

So ""LEMON"" or similar.

Another common word: ""PHONE"" has P H O N E, positions: P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)

N at position 4 forbidden, E at position 5 forbidden.

Not good.

""SHONE"" has S and H, S absent.

So I'll go with ""LEMON"" for the next guess.

But in ""LEMON"", E is at position 2, which we don't know if it can be or not, but it's a possible position.

Similarly, N at position 5.

O at position 4.

By guessing ""LEMON"", we can get feedback on these positions and also on M and L.

If E is correct at position 2, we get a ✓, etc.

Now, confirm the state.

Also, we have used letters so far: from guess 1: C,R,A,N,E; guess 2: T,O,N,E,S.

N and E repeated.

Now guessing L,E,M,O,N — L, M new.

If any of L or M are in the word, we'll know.

If not, we eliminate them.

So it's a good guess.### Step-by-Step Thought Process

To make an informed third guess, I need to consolidate all information from the previous feedback and deduce possible constraints for the secret word.

**Information from Previous Feedback:**

1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)**
   - Letters **not** in the word: C, R, A.
   - Letters **in** the word but wrong positions: N (not position 4), E (not position 5).
   - This gives us two confirmed letters: N and E, with positional constraints.

2. **Guess 2: ""tones"" → Feedback: T(x) O(-) N(-) E(-) S(x)**
   - Letters **not** in the word: T, S (adding to the absent list from Guess 1).
   - Letters **in** the word but wrong positions: 
     - O (not position 2),
     - N (not position 3, as it was in position 3 here and got '-'),
     - E (not position 4, as it was in position 4 here and got '-').
   - This confirms O is in the word and refines positional constraints for N and E.

**Consolidated Constraints:**

- **Absent Letters:** A, C, R, S, T (totally excluded).
- **Present Letters:** N, E, O (must be included in the guess).
- **Positional Constraints:**
  - N: Cannot be at position 3 or 4, so possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.
  - E: Cannot be at position 4 or 5, so possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.
  - O: Cannot be at position 2, so possible positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- The secret word has 5 letters, with N, E, O confirmed, meaning there are two additional unknown letters (not absent, so must be from the remaining alphabet).
- There are no indications of duplicate letters yet, so the word might have all unique letters, but this is not confirmed.

**Strategy for Third Guess:**
- **Must Include:** N, E, O (to test their positions).
- **Must Avoid:** Absent letters (A, C, R, S, T) and positions where we know N, E, or O can't be.
- **Aim:** Test new common letters to gather more information—ideal candidates are high-frequency consonants like L, M, D, P, or vowels like I, U, but should form a valid English word.
- **Position Planning:** 
  - E is likely at position 1, 2, or 3.
  - N is likely at position 1, 2, or 5.
  - O is likely at any position except 2.
  - Avoid conflicts where positions overlap (e.g., positions 1 and 2 can't hold both N and E if they share the same spot).
- Given the constraints, a suitable word could place E at position 2 (a possible and common spot), N at position 5 (to test if it's the last letter), O at position 4 (avoiding position 2), and introduce new letters like L and M.

**Evaluating Candidate Words:**
- Consider ""lemon"" (L, E, M, O, N):
  - Positions: E at 2 (valid), O at 4 (valid, not 2), N at 5 (valid, not 3 or 4).
  - Contains N, E, O correctly.
  - New letters: L and M (common; if they are absent, we eliminate them; if present, we learn their status).
  - Valid word: ""lemon"" is a common English word for a fruit.
- Other candidates like ""demon"" (D, E, M, O, N) are also possible but ""lemon"" is chosen to prioritize common letters and avoid less familiar ones. Words like ""melon"" (M, E, L, O, N) are similar but E is at position 2 in both, so equivalent.
- Avoid words like ""noise"" (has S, absent), ""bones"" (has S, absent), or ""honey"" (O at position 2 forbidden).

**Why ""lemon""?**
- Tests E at position 2: If correct (✓), we lock position 2; if incorrect (-), we know E is still elsewhere (position 1 or 3).
- Tests N at position 5: Similarly, informs if N is last.
- Tests O at position 4: New position, could be correct or not.
- Introduces L and M: If either is in the word, we get positional feedback; if absent (x), we eliminate them.
- Overall, this maximizes information on positions and new letters while adhering to all constraints.",Guess 3: lemon -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) M(x) O(✓) N(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,endow,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and positions to maximize information.
 Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
 A good starting word is often ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Another popular one is ""ROATE"". However, let's choose one that has unique letters and covers common ones.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
   - All letters are distinct, so we get maximum information.

 But note: the problem does not require the word to have distinct letters, but having distinct letters is better for information.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a very good starting word because it has S, L, A, T, E which are all common.

 Since the problem does not specify any constraints on the word, I can choose any valid 5-letter word.

 Let me choose ""SLATE"" for the first guess.

 However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we are free to choose.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice. But let me check: in Wordle, ""CRANE"" is a good starter.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the cumulative return of an investment) is also used by some, but it might be less familiar.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 But wait, the problem says ""valid 5-letter English word"". We must ensure it's valid.

 Let me think of common words: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ADIEU"" (if we want many vowels). 

 I choose ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: x (not in the word)
N: - (in the word but wrong position)
E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters N and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed.

In the first guess, we had:
Position 1: C (x) -> not in word
Position 2: R (x) -> not in word
Position 3: A (x) -> not in word
Position 4: N (-) -> in word, but not at position 4
Position 5: E (-) -> in word, but not at position 5

Therefore, the secret word:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E, but not at the 4th and 5th positions respectively.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Must contain N and E (since they are present in the word).
- The N cannot be at position 4 and the E cannot be at position 5.

Also, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of possible words that include N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

We know N is in the word but not at position 4. So N can be at positions 1,2,3, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5.

Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so E can be at positions 1,2,3,4.

We also don't know the other letters. We have to guess 3 more letters.

We should try to cover common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried. We have used C,R,A,N,E. So we should try other common letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We have two known letters: N and E. We need to include them in the word, but in positions that are not forbidden.

Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

We also want to test other common letters.

Let me try to think of words that have N and E, and avoid C,R,A.

For example, words like ""SENT"", but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

5-letter words: 
- Let's try to put E in a new position, say position 1? But we don't know. We can try to put E in position 2 or 3 or 4.

Similarly, N can be in position 1,2,3,5.

But note: we don't want to put N in position 4 (already known wrong) and E in position 5 (known wrong).

Also, we must avoid C,R,A.

Let me list some words:

Option 1: ""NEEDS"" - but has two E's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, but note: if a letter appears twice, the feedback might be tricky. However, in the rules, it's not specified. But typically, if the secret word has two of the same letter, then the feedback will reflect that. But in our case, we don't have any duplicate in the feedback so far.

But we don't know the secret word. So we should avoid duplicates for now to get more information? Or it's okay.

But note: we have to use N and E. We don't know if the secret word has duplicates. So it's safe to assume no duplicates until we see evidence.

But the word ""NEEDS"" has two E's. We don't know if that's allowed. But the secret word might have duplicates? The example didn't have duplicates.

To be safe, let's try a word without duplicates.

Another word: ""LINEN"" - but that has two N's. Also, we don't know if L and I are in the word.

We need to test new letters.

Let me think of words that have E and N, and three new letters.

Common words: 
- ""STONE"": S, T, O, N, E -> avoids C,R,A. 
  - Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)
  But wait: we know that N cannot be at position 4 (from the feedback of the first guess: N was at position 4 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not at position 4). So if we put N at position 4 again, that would be invalid? Actually, we can put it, but we know it's not correct. But we are trying to get information about other positions.

However, we already know that position 4 is not N. So putting N at position 4 in this guess would be a waste because we know it's not there. Similarly, we know E is not at position 5.

So in ""STONE"", we are putting N at position 4 (which we know is wrong) and E at position 5 (which we know is wrong). So that would not be efficient.

We should avoid putting N at position 4 and E at position 5.

So let's choose a word where N is not at 4 and E is not at 5.

For example:
- Put E at position 1: words like ""E...N""
- Or E at position 2: ""?E..N"" or ""?E.?N"" etc.

Let me try to form a word.

Option: ""NOISE"" -> N, O, I, S, E
- Positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5)
But E is at position 5, which we know is wrong for E (because in the first guess, E was at 5 and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at 5). So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct. So we would get a '-' again for E at 5, which we already know. That doesn't give new information.

We want to test E in a new position. So we should avoid position 5 for E.

Similarly, avoid position 4 for N.

So in ""NOISE"", we have N at position 1 (which is new) and E at position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we are wasting the E position.

We need to put E in a position that is not 5. So positions 1,2,3,4.

Similarly, N in positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

Let me try to put E at position 1: E _ _ _ _

And we need to include N somewhere not at 4.

For example: ""E...N"" at the end? But then N would be at position 5.

So ""E _ _ _ N""

But we have three more letters to fill, and avoid C,R,A.

Words: ""ELDEN"" (but that has two E's? E at 1 and E at 4? No, ""ELDEN"" is E,L,D,E,N -> two E's. Not good for information.

""EVENT"" -> E,V,E,N,T -> two E's.

""EXIST"" -> E,X,I,S,T -> no N.

""EDGES"" -> E,D,G,E,S -> two E's.

""ENDOW"" -> E,N,D,O,W -> has N at position 2? 
Positions: E(1), N(2), D(3), O(4), W(5)
This word: 
- E at position 1 (new)
- N at position 2 (new) -> and we avoid position 4 for N and position 5 for E.

Also, it uses new letters: D, O, W.

So ""ENDOW"" is a valid word.

But note: we have N at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Another option: put E at position 2.

For example: ""?E?N?"" 

Words: ""SENT"" is 4 letters. 5 letters: ""LEMON"" -> L,E,M,O,N -> positions: L(1),E(2),M(3),O(4),N(5). 
This has E at 2 and N at 5 (which is allowed because we know N is not at 4, and 5 is new; and E is not at 5, but at 2 is new).

Also, avoids C,R,A.

""LEMON"" uses L, M, O.

Another word: ""BEING"" -> B,E,I,N,G -> positions: B(1),E(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). 
But N is at position 4, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

So ""LEMON"" seems better.

But we have to consider that we are testing new letters.

We have used: C,R,A,N,E in the first guess. Now we are going to use L,E,M,O,N in ""LEMON"". But note: E and N are repeated. But we are testing their positions.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat any letters from the first guess? But we have to include E and N, so we cannot avoid them.

But we can avoid using the same letters that were wrong (C,R,A) and use new ones.

So ""LEMON"" uses L, E, M, O, N. The letters L, M, O are new.

Similarly, ""ENDOW"" uses E, N, D, O, W. All except E and N are new.

Both are good.

Another common word: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E -> but that doesn't have N. We must include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include both N and E.

So words without N or E are invalid because we know the word has N and E.

Therefore, we must choose a word that contains both N and E.

Now, between ""ENDOW"" and ""LEMON"", which one?

""ENDOW"": E at 1, N at 2, D at 3, O at 4, W at 5.
- We test E at position 1 (which might be correct or not) and N at position 2 (might be correct or not). Also, we test D, O, W.

""LEMON"": L at 1, E at 2, M at 3, O at 4, N at 5.
- E at position 2 and N at position 5.

We don't know which positions are correct, so both are valid.

But note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and E at position 5. Now we are moving them to new positions.

We might also consider the frequency of letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

In ""ENDOW"", we are testing D, O, W.
In ""LEMON"", we are testing L, M, O.

O is common in both.

But M is less common than D? Or W? 

We can also consider ""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E -> positions: N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). 
But E is at position 5, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5). 
This has E at position 4 (which is new) and N at position 2 (new). 
Avoids C,R,A. 
Uses I, L, T which are common.

So ""INLET"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""SINCE"": but has C? We cannot use C because we know C is not in the word.

""MINCE"": has C and M? C is not allowed.

""ONCE"": 4 letters.

So ""INLET"" seems good: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

We are testing:
- N at position 2 (new)
- E at position 4 (new) -> but note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and got '-', meaning N is not at 4. But now we are putting E at position 4. That's allowed because E is a different letter.

We are testing positions 1,2,3,4,5 with new letters except for N and E.

Another word: ""UNSET"": U, N, S, E, T -> positions: U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5). Similar to ""INLET"".

But ""UNSET"" might be less common? ""INLET"" is more common.

We can also do ""STONE"" but with N not at 4 and E not at 5? How? ""STONE"" has N at 4 and E at 5, which we want to avoid.

We can rearrange: ""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: T(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
This has N at position 3 (new) and E at position 4 (new). 
Avoids C,R,A. 
Uses T, O, S.

This is a good candidate.

So now we have:
- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> N at 2, E at 4
- ""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> N at 3, E at 4
- ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> E at 2, N at 5
- ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W -> E at 1, N at 2

Which one to choose?

We want to maximize the number of new letters and common letters.

In ""TONES"", we have S and T which are very common.

In ""INLET"", we have T and L.

In ""LEMON"", we have L and M.

In ""ENDOW"", we have D and W (W is less common).

So ""TONES"" and ""INLET"" are better.

Between ""TONES"" and ""INLET"", which one?

""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: T(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5)
""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

Note: in ""TONES"", we are putting E at position 4. In the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong. But that doesn't directly say anything about E at position 4. It could be that position 4 is E? We don't know.

Similarly, in ""INLET"", we are putting E at position 4.

But we also note that in the first guess, position 4 was N and it was wrong, but that doesn't prevent position 4 from being E.

So both are valid.

I think ""TONES"" is a good choice because it has S and T which are very common.

Alternatively, we can choose ""SLATE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess: A was x). So ""SLATE"" has A, which is not allowed.

Similarly, ""CRATE"" has C and R and A, all not allowed.

So ""TONES"" is valid.

Let me confirm: T, O, N, E, S.

We are including N and E, and avoiding C,R,A.

We are putting N at position 3 (which is not 4) and E at position 4 (which is not 5). So we are testing new positions.

Therefore, I will go with ""TONES"".

But note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting E at position 4. That is acceptable because we are testing if E is at position 4.

Similarly, we are testing N at position 3.

So let's choose ""TONES"".

But wait, is ""TONES"" a valid word? Yes, it means musical tones.

Another option: ""STONE"" is the same as ""TONES"" but rearranged. ""STONE"" would be S,T,O,N,E -> but then N is at position 4, which we want to avoid. So ""STONE"" is not good because of position 4 for N.

But ""TONES"" has N at position 3 and E at position 4.

So ""TONES"" is better.

We can also consider ""SENT"" but it's 4 letters.

So I think ""TONES"" is a good second guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""TONES"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A not in the word; N and E in the word but in wrong positions), the second guess must:
- Include N and E (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid C, R, A (as they are not in the word).
- Place N in a position other than 4 (since it was wrong there in the first guess).
- Place E in a position other than 5 (since it was wrong there in the first guess).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""TONES"" is chosen because:
- It includes N (at position 3) and E (at position 4), both in new positions to test.
- It avoids C, R, A.
- It introduces new common letters: T, O, S (which are high-frequency and can help narrow down possibilities).
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: tones -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) N(-) E(-) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to review the feedback from previous guesses to understand what we know about the secret word.

From Guess 1 (""crane""):  
- C(x) - not in the word  
- R(x) - not in the word  
- A(x) - not in the word  
- N(-) - in the word but not at position 4

- N(-) - in the word but not at position 3 (since N is repeated, but feedback depends on position)  
- E(-) - in the word but not at position 4  
- S(x) - not in the word  

In ""tones"", positions are:  
1. T  
2. O  
3. N  
4. E  
5. S  

Feedback:  
- T(x) - T not in the word  
- O(-) - O in the word, but not at position 2  
- N(-) - N in the word, but not at position 3  
- E(-) - E in the word, but not at position 4  
- S(x) - S not in the word  

Combining all information:

Letters not in the word: C, R, A (from guess 1), T (from guess 2), S (from guess 2). So definitely not present: A, C, R, S, T.

Letters in the word:  
- N is in the word, but not at position 4 (from guess 1) and not at position 3 (from guess 2).  
- E is in the word, but not at position 5 (from guess 1) and not at position 4 (from guess 2).  
- O is in the word, but not at position 2 (from guess 2).

We also have positions where letters are incorrect. Specifically for N and E:

- N cannot be at position 3 or 4. Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 5.  
- E cannot be at position 4 or 5. Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3.  
- O cannot be at position 2. Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but we need to consider overall constraints).

The word has five positions. We know N, E, and O are in the word, and likely other letters since we have three confirmed letters.

List of known present letters: N, E, O.

Absent letters: A, C, R, S, T.

From feedback, O is in the word but not position 2.

E is in the word but not position 4 or 5, so E must be at position 1, 2, or 3.

N is in the word but not position 3 or 4, so N must be at position 1, 2, or 5.

Since we have multiple present letters, and positions to assign.

Also, in guess 2, N was at position 3 and E at position 4, but both got ""-"" meaning they are not at those positions; but since we already knew N wasn't at position 4 and E not at position 5, the new info is that N isn't at position 3 and E isn't at position 4.

Now, for the next guess, we need to make a word that uses N, E, O, and two new letters, but avoiding the absent letters.

Possible letters to try: common consonants like L, M, P, D, etc., or vowels like I, U, but we need English words.

We should aim to test possible positions for N and E.

For example, E can be at 1,2,3; N at 1,2,5.

But position 1 can't be both E and N, so we need to cover different cases.

Also, O is somewhere not at position 2.

The secret word must have exactly these letters: at least N, E, O, and two more letters that are not A,C,R,S,T.

In feedback, for guess 2, O got ""-"" at position 2, meaning O is in the word but position is wrong.

Now, let's think of possible words that fit the constraints.

First, E must be in positions 1,2,3; N in 1,2,5; O can be anywhere except 2.

But position conflict: if N is at 1, E can't be at 1, similarly if E at 1, N can't be at 1, etc.

Possible combinations:

- If E at position 1, then N can be at 2 or 5 (since position 1 taken).  
- If E at position 2, then N can be at 1 or 5 (position 2 taken, and position 3 not possible for N).  
- If E at position 3, then N can be at 1,2, or 5.

O can be wherever not taken and not position 2.

Then the remaining two letters need to be filled.

Since we don't know the other two letters, we should choose a word that tests common letters and positions.

For instance, we could try to place E at position 1 to see if it's correct.

Similarly for N at position 5 or 1.

Let's think of candidate words.

First, ensure we include all known present letters: N, E, O must be in the word. We aren't 100% sure there are only three, but based on feedback so far, no indication of more than three, but there could be other letters. In guess 1 and guess 2, we have three ""-"" but that might correspond to the three letters, or there could be more. Actually, in guess 1, two ""-"" for N and E, in guess 2 three ""-"" for O, N, E. Guess 2 had O, N, E all getting ""-"" or possible duplicates, but in this case all distinct, so likely the word has O in addition.

In guess 1: N and E are present.

Guess 2: O, N, E are present, and N/E again confirm they are present.

So the secret word contains N, E, O, and two other letters not from A,C,R,S,T.

The two other letters are unknown; we need to discover them.

So for the next guess, we should include N, E, O, and two new letters, say from common ones: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, etc.

Also, we need to avoid placing E at positions 4 or 5, N at positions 3 or 4, and O not at position 2.

But in the guess, we can place them in possible positions to test.

For example, let's try E at position 1.

If E is at position 1, then it could be correct or not. But since it must be at 1,2,3, placing at 1 tests that.

Similarly, N could be at 1,2, or 5; but if E is at 1, N cannot be at 1, so N at 2 or 5.

O not at position 2.

So if E is at position 1, then word: E _ _ _ _

N must be included, at position 2 or 5.

If N at position 2: E N _ _ _

Then O cannot be at position 2 since it's taken by N, so O at 3,4,5, but position 2 is taken, so O at 3,4,5.

Now fill the blanks.

For example: E N O _ _ but that might not be valid, like ""ENOL"" is not a common word.

""ENO L"" with L? ""ENOLS"" is a word? ""Enols"" is chemical, but might be accepted.

Better choose common words.

E at 1, N at 5: E _ _ _ N

Then O at 2,3,4 but not at 2? If O at position 2, feedback said O not at position 2, so O cannot be at 2.

So if E at 1, and N at 5, then O must be at 3 or 4.

Position 2 needs a letter.

Say E _ O _ N, with O at 3, and _ at 2 and 4.

But position 4: if we put a letter there.

Word: E X O Y N

We need to choose X and Y, not from absent letters.

Absent: A,C,R,S,T.

Possible letters: say I and L, ""ELOIN"" E L O I N, but ""ELOIN"" means to enclose, not very common.

""EX CON"" but not 5 letters.

Difficult if N is at 5.

Perhaps put E at position 3.

Try E at position 3: then word: _ _ E _ _

N at position 1,2, or 5.

O not at position 2.

For example, N at position 1: N _ E _ _

Then O not at position 2, so O at position 4 or 5.

Position 2 needs a letter, position 4 or 5 O.

Say N X E Y O or N X E O Y .

If O at position 4: N X E O _

Or O at position 5: N X E _ O

Fill with letters.

Common words: ""N I E L O"" not a word.

""NA EVO"" no.

""NOBEL"": N O B E L

Positions: N(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), L(5)

But O is at position 2? But feedback said O cannot be at position 2. In guess 2, O was at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning O not at position 2. So we cannot place O at position 2.

In ""NOBEL"", O is at position 2, which is forbidden.

So if we try ""NOBEL"", O at position 2 would be wrong, so we know it would get ""-"", but we already know that.

But we want to test new letter positions.

So avoid position 2 for O.

Similarly, E cannot be at position 4, but in ""NOBEL"", E is at position 4, which is also forbidden based on previous feedback (in guess 2, E at position E got ""-"", so not at position 4).

In guess 2, E was at position 4 and got ""-"", so E not at position 4.

So for E, positions 1,2,3 possible.

For E in ""NOBEL"" at position 4, which is not allowed, so it would be incorrect.

We need a word where E is not at 4 or 5, N not at 3 or 4, O not at 2.

Let's list possible words.

Example: ""LEMON"" - L E M O N

Positions: L(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5)

Now check constraints:

E is at position 2 - this is possible, since E can be at 1,2,3.

N is at position 5 - possible, since N can be at 1,2,5.

O is at position 4 - possible.

But letters: L, E, M, O, N. We have E, N, O, and new L and M.

Absent letters: A,C,R,S,T not used, good.

Position for E: position 2, which is ok.

Position for N: position 5, ok.

Position for O: position 4, not position 2, ok.

""LEMON"" is a common word.

Perhaps ""DEMON"" - D E M O N

Positions: D(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5)

Similar to above, E at 2, N at 5, O at 4.

Good.

Another option: ""OVEN"" is 4 letters.

"" ONSET"" but S is absent, S is not in the word, from guess 2 S(x), so S is not in the word. So ""ONSET"" has S, not allowed.

"" INLET"" but T is absent? T is not in the word, from guess 2 T(x), so T not in word. ""INLET"" has T, not allowed.

""NOIS E"" has S, not allowed.

""LOVES"" has S, not allowed.

""MONTE"" has T, not allowed.

So ""LEMON"" or ""DEMON"" seem good.

""BONEY"" - B O N E Y, positions: B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5)

E at position 4? But E cannot be at position 4, from feedback. E not at position 4. So this is not good.

"" POUND"" - P O U N D, positions: P(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5)

N at position 4? But N cannot be at position 4, from feedback. So not good.

"" NEIGH"" - N E I G H, positions: N(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), H(5)

N at position 1, E at position 2, both ok, O not included? But O must be in the word, from feedback.

""NEIGH"" does not have O, but we know O is in the word, so it would be an invalid guess because it misses O.

We must include O, as it is present.

Similarly, must include N and E.

So possible words like ""LEMON"", ""DEMON"", or "" HONEY"" but H O N E Y positions: H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) — O at position 2, but O cannot be at position 2, and E at position 4, not allowed.

O at position 2 is forbidden.

So avoid that.

""DOZEN"" - D O Z E N, positions: D(1), O(2), Z(3), E(4), N(5) — O at position 2 forbidden, E at position 4 forbidden.

Not good.

""OUNCE"" but C is absent, C not in word, and E at position 5? E not at position 5.

""OUNCE"" has C and E at 5, not good.

""CLONE"" has C and L, C not allowed.

So back to ""LEMON"" or ""DEMON"".

""ONION"" has O and N, but no E? Must have E, so not.

""OPINE"" O P I N E, positions: O(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5)

N at position 4 forbidden, E at position 5 forbidden? E not at position 5, but position 5 here is E, which is not allowed.

E cannot be at position 5.

So not good.

""ALONE"" has A, absent.

Better to stick with ""LEMON"" or ""DEMON"".

Another word: ""MINER"" has M,I,N,E,R but R is absent.

R not in word.

""HOMED"" H O M E D, positions: H(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), D(5) — O at position 2 forbidden, E at position 4 forbidden.

""MODEL"" has O but no E or N? Must include E and N.

""DOE N"" not 5 letters separately.

"" DON E N"" not.

Perhaps ""DIODE"" has O and E but no N.

""DENIM"" D E N I M, positions: D(1), E(2), N(3), I(4), M(5)

N at position 3? But N cannot be at position 3, from guess 2 feedback. In guess 2, N was at position 3 and got ""-"", so not at position 3.

So here N at position 3 is not allowed.

E at position 2 is ok.

But N not at position 3.

Similarly, O not included? ""DENIM"" has no O.

Must have O.

So invalid.

""ENJOY"" E N J O Y, positions: E(1), N(2), J(3), O(4), Y(5)

This could work: E at 1, N at 2 (positions ok), O at 4 (ok, not position 2).

Letters: E,N,J,O,Y — J is not common, but possible.

Better to use more common letters.

""BEVUE"" not word.

So ""LEMON"" seems good: L E M O N, with E at position 2, O at position 4, N at position 5.

Position 4: O, and we don't have constraint against O at position 4, only not at 2.

Position 5: N, which is allowed for N since positions 1,2,5 possible.

Position 2: E, possible.

Similarly, ""DEMON"": D E M O N, same positions.

""MOON"" 4 letters.

""NOBLE"" has N O B L E, positions: N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5)

O at position 2 — forbidden, E at position 5 — forbidden (E not at position 5).

Not good.

""NOISY"" has S, absent.

So I think ""LEMON"" is a solid choice.

We could try E at position 3.

For example: "" M E L O N"" but M E L O N is not a word, ""MELON"" M E L O N? Positions: M(1), E(2), L(3), O(4), N(5)

E at position 2, not 3.

""LINE O"" not.

"" O L E N D"" not word.

""FIELD"" has F I E L D, no O.

""PILOT"" has P I L O T, T absent, and no E or N.

Must include E and N.

""NE O N"" has two N, ""NEONS"" S absent.

Not.

So ""LEMON"" or similar.

Another common word: ""PHONE"" has P H O N E, positions: P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)

N at position 4 forbidden, E at position 5 forbidden.

Not good.

""SHONE"" has S and H, S absent.

So I'll go with ""LEMON"" for the next guess.

But in ""LEMON"", E is at position 2, which we don't know if it can be or not, but it's a possible position.

Similarly, N at position 5.

O at position 4.

By guessing ""LEMON"", we can get feedback on these positions and also on M and L.

If E is correct at position 2, we get a ✓, etc.

Now, confirm the state.

Also, we have used letters so far: from guess 1: C,R,A,N,E; guess 2: T,O,N,E,S.

N and E repeated.

Now guessing L,E,M,O,N — L, M new.

If any of L or M are in the word, we'll know.

If not, we eliminate them.

So it's a good guess.### Step-by-Step Thought Process

To make an informed third guess, I need to consolidate all information from the previous feedback and deduce possible constraints for the secret word.

**Information from Previous Feedback:**

1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)**
   - Letters **not** in the word: C, R, A.
   - Letters **in** the word but wrong positions: N (not position 4), E (not position 5).
   - This gives us two confirmed letters: N and E, with positional constraints.

2. **Guess 2: ""tones"" → Feedback: T(x) O(-) N(-) E(-) S(x)**
   - Letters **not** in the word: T, S (adding to the absent list from Guess 1).
   - Letters **in** the word but wrong positions: 
     - O (not position 2),
     - N (not position 3, as it was in position 3 here and got '-'),
     - E (not position 4, as it was in position 4 here and got '-').
   - This confirms O is in the word and refines positional constraints for N and E.

**Consolidated Constraints:**

- **Absent Letters:** A, C, R, S, T (totally excluded).
- **Present Letters:** N, E, O (must be included in the guess).
- **Positional Constraints:**
  - N: Cannot be at position 3 or 4, so possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.
  - E: Cannot be at position 4 or 5, so possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.
  - O: Cannot be at position 2, so possible positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- The secret word has 5 letters, with N, E, O confirmed, meaning there are two additional unknown letters (not absent, so must be from the remaining alphabet).
- There are no indications of duplicate letters yet, so the word might have all unique letters, but this is not confirmed.

**Strategy for Third Guess:**
- **Must Include:** N, E, O (to test their positions).
- **Must Avoid:** Absent letters (A, C, R, S, T) and positions where we know N, E, or O can't be.
- **Aim:** Test new common letters to gather more information—ideal candidates are high-frequency consonants like L, M, D, P, or vowels like I, U, but should form a valid English word.
- **Position Planning:** 
  - E is likely at position 1, 2, or 3.
  - N is likely at position 1, 2, or 5.
  - O is likely at any position except 2.
  - Avoid conflicts where positions overlap (e.g., positions 1 and 2 can't hold both N and E if they share the same spot).
- Given the constraints, a suitable word could place E at position 2 (a possible and common spot), N at position 5 (to test if it's the last letter), O at position 4 (avoiding position 2), and introduce new letters like L and M.

**Evaluating Candidate Words:**
- Consider ""lemon"" (L, E, M, O, N):
  - Positions: E at 2 (valid), O at 4 (valid, not 2), N at 5 (valid, not 3 or 4).
  - Contains N, E, O correctly.
  - New letters: L and M (common; if they are absent, we eliminate them; if present, we learn their status).
  - Valid word: ""lemon"" is a common English word for a fruit.
- Other candidates like ""demon"" (D, E, M, O, N) are also possible but ""lemon"" is chosen to prioritize common letters and avoid less familiar ones. Words like ""melon"" (M, E, L, O, N) are similar but E is at position 2 in both, so equivalent.
- Avoid words like ""noise"" (has S, absent), ""bones"" (has S, absent), or ""honey"" (O at position 2 forbidden).

**Why ""lemon""?**
- Tests E at position 2: If correct (✓), we lock position 2; if incorrect (-), we know E is still elsewhere (position 1 or 3).
- Tests N at position 5: Similarly, informs if N is last.
- Tests O at position 4: New position, could be correct or not.
- Introduces L and M: If either is in the word, we get positional feedback; if absent (x), we eliminate them.
- Overall, this maximizes information on positions and new letters while adhering to all constraints.

We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. The feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates, but note: if a letter appears twice, the feedback might be tricky. However, in the rules, it\'s not specified. But typically, if the secret word has two of the same letter, then the feedback will reflect that. But in our case, we don\'t have any duplicate in the feedback so far.\n\nBut we don\'t know the secret word. So we should avoid duplicates for now to get more information? Or it\'s okay.\n\nBut note: we have to use N and E. We don\'t know if the secret word has duplicates. So it\'s safe to assume no duplicates until we see evidence.\n\nBut the word ""NEEDS"" has two E\'s. We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. But the secret word might have duplicates? The example didn\'t have duplicates.\n\nTo be safe, let\'s try a word without duplicates.\n\nAnother word: ""LINEN"" - but that has two N\'s. Also, we don\'t know if L and I are in the word.\n\nWe need to test new letters.\n\nLet me think of words that have E and N, and three new letters.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""STONE"": S, T, O, N, E -> avoids C,R,A. \n  - Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)\n  But wait: we know that N cannot be at position 4 (from the feedback of the first guess: N was at position 4 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 4). So if we put N at position 4 again, that would be invalid? Actually, we can put it, but we know it\'s not correct. But we are trying to get information about other positions.\n\nHowever, we already know that position 4 is not N. So putting N at position 4 in this guess would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. Similarly, we know E is not at position 5.\n\nSo in ""STONE"", we are putting N at position 4 (which we know is wrong) and E at position 5 (which we know is wrong). So that would not be efficient.\n\nWe should avoid putting N at position 4 and E at position 5.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word where N is not at 4 and E is not at 5.\n\nFor example:\n- Put E at position 1: words like ""E...N""\n- Or E at position 2: ""?E..N"" or ""?E.?N"" etc.\n\nLet me try to form a word.\n\nOption: ""NOISE"" -> N, O, I, S, E\n- Positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5)\nBut E is at position 5, which we know is wrong for E (because in the first guess, E was at 5 and got \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not at 5). So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not correct. So we would get a \'-\' again for E at 5, which we already know. That doesn\'t give new information.\n\nWe want to test E in a new position. So we should avoid position 5 for E.\n\nSimilarly, avoid position 4 for N.\n\nSo in ""NOISE"", we have N at position 1 (which is new) and E at position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we are wasting the E position.\n\nWe need to put E in a position that is not 5. So positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, N in positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).\n\nLet me try to put E at position 1: E _ _ _ _\n\nAnd we need to include N somewhere not at 4.\n\nFor example: ""E...N"" at the end? But then N would be at position 5.\n\nSo ""E _ _ _ N""\n\nBut we have three more letters to fill, and avoid C,R,A.\n\nWords: ""ELDEN"" (but that has two E\'s? E at 1 and E at 4? No, ""ELDEN"" is E,L,D,E,N -> two E\'s. Not good for information.\n\n""EVENT"" -> E,V,E,N,T -> two E\'s.\n\n""EXIST"" -> E,X,I,S,T -> no N.\n\n""EDGES"" -> E,D,G,E,S -> two E\'s.\n\n""ENDOW"" -> E,N,D,O,W -> has N at position 2? \nPositions: E(1), N(2), D(3), O(4), W(5)\nThis word: \n- E at position 1 (new)\n- N at position 2 (new) -> and we avoid position 4 for N and position 5 for E.\n\nAlso, it uses new letters: D, O, W.\n\nSo ""ENDOW"" is a valid word.\n\nBut note: we have N at position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\nAnother option: put E at position 2.\n\nFor example: ""?E?N?"" \n\nWords: ""SENT"" is 4 letters. 5 letters: ""LEMON"" -> L,E,M,O,N -> positions: L(1),E(2),M(3),O(4),N(5). \nThis has E at 2 and N at 5 (which is allowed because we know N is not at 4, and 5 is new; and E is not at 5, but at 2 is new).\n\nAlso, avoids C,R,A.\n\n""LEMON"" uses L, M, O.\n\nAnother word: ""BEING"" -> B,E,I,N,G -> positions: B(1),E(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). \nBut N is at position 4, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\nSo ""LEMON"" seems better.\n\nBut we have to consider that we are testing new letters.\n\nWe have used: C,R,A,N,E in the first guess. Now we are going to use L,E,M,O,N in ""LEMON"". But note: E and N are repeated. But we are testing their positions.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t repeat any letters from the first guess? But we have to include E and N, so we cannot avoid them.\n\nBut we can avoid using the same letters that were wrong (C,R,A) and use new ones.\n\nSo ""LEMON"" uses L, E, M, O, N. The letters L, M, O are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""ENDOW"" uses E, N, D, O, W. All except E and N are new.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nAnother common word: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E -> but that doesn\'t have N. We must include N because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nWe must include both N and E.\n\nSo words without N or E are invalid because we know the word has N and E.\n\nTherefore, we must choose a word that contains both N and E.\n\nNow, between ""ENDOW"" and ""LEMON"", which one?\n\n""ENDOW"": E at 1, N at 2, D at 3, O at 4, W at 5.\n- We test E at position 1 (which might be correct or not) and N at position 2 (might be correct or not). Also, we test D, O, W.\n\n""LEMON"": L at 1, E at 2, M at 3, O at 4, N at 5.\n- E at position 2 and N at position 5.\n\nWe don\'t know which positions are correct, so both are valid.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and E at position 5. Now we are moving them to new positions.\n\nWe might also consider the frequency of letters.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\nIn ""ENDOW"", we are testing D, O, W.\nIn ""LEMON"", we are testing L, M, O.\n\nO is common in both.\n\nBut M is less common than D? Or W? \n\nWe can also consider ""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E -> positions: N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). \nBut E is at position 5, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.\n\n""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5). \nThis has E at position 4 (which is new) and N at position 2 (new). \nAvoids C,R,A. \nUses I, L, T which are common.\n\nSo ""INLET"" is a good candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""SINCE"": but has C? We cannot use C because we know C is not in the word.\n\n""MINCE"": has C and M? C is not allowed.\n\n""ONCE"": 4 letters.\n\nSo ""INLET"" seems good: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)\n\nWe are testing:\n- N at position 2 (new)\n- E at position 4 (new) -> but note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and got \'-\', meaning N is not at 4. But now we are putting E at position 4. That\'s allowed because E is a different letter.\n\nWe are testing positions 1,2,3,4,5 with new letters except for N and E.\n\nAnother word: ""UNSET"": U, N, S, E, T -> positions: U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5). Similar to ""INLET"".\n\nBut ""UNSET"" might be less common? ""INLET"" is more common.\n\nWe can also do ""STONE"" but with N not at 4 and E not at 5? How? ""STONE"" has N at 4 and E at 5, which we want to avoid.\n\nWe can rearrange: ""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: T(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \nThis has N at position 3 (new) and E at position 4 (new). \nAvoids C,R,A. \nUses T, O, S.\n\nThis is a good candidate.\n\nSo now we have:\n- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> N at 2, E at 4\n- ""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> N at 3, E at 4\n- ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> E at 2, N at 5\n- ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W -> E at 1, N at 2\n\nWhich one to choose?\n\nWe want to maximize the number of new letters and common letters.\n\nIn ""TONES"", we have S and T which are very common.\n\nIn ""INLET"", we have T and L.\n\nIn ""LEMON"", we have L and M.\n\nIn ""ENDOW"", we have D and W (W is less common).\n\nSo ""TONES"" and ""INLET"" are better.\n\nBetween ""TONES"" and ""INLET"", which one?\n\n""TONES"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: T(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5)\n""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)\n\nNote: in ""TONES"", we are putting E at position 4. In the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong. But that doesn\'t directly say anything about E at position 4. It could be that position 4 is E? We don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, in ""INLET"", we are putting E at position 4.\n\nBut we also note that in the first guess, position 4 was N and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t prevent position 4 from being E.\n\nSo both are valid.\n\nI think ""TONES"" is a good choice because it has S and T which are very common.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""SLATE"" but we know A is not in the word (from first guess: A was x). So ""SLATE"" has A, which is not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""CRATE"" has C and R and A, all not allowed.\n\nSo ""TONES"" is valid.\n\nLet me confirm: T, O, N, E, S.\n\nWe are including N and E, and avoiding C,R,A.\n\nWe are putting N at position 3 (which is not 4) and E at position 4 (which is not 5). So we are testing new positions.\n\nTherefore, I will go with ""TONES"".\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting E at position 4. That is acceptable because we are testing if E is at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, we are testing N at position 3.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""TONES"".\n\nBut wait, is ""TONES"" a valid word? Yes, it means musical tones.\n\nAnother option: ""STONE"" is the same as ""TONES"" but rearranged. ""STONE"" would be S,T,O,N,E -> but then N is at position 4, which we want to avoid. So ""STONE"" is not good because of position 4 for N.\n\nBut ""TONES"" has N at position 3 and E at position 4.\n\nSo ""TONES"" is better.\n\nWe can also consider ""SENT"" but it\'s 4 letters.\n\nSo I think ""TONES"" is a good second guess.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""TONES"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A not in the word; N and E in the word but in wrong positions), the second guess must:\n- Include N and E (since they are in the secret word).\n- Avoid C, R, A (as they are not in the word).\n- Place N in a position other than 4 (since it was wrong there in the first guess).\n- Place E in a position other than 5 (since it was wrong there in the first guess).\n- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""TONES"" is chosen because:\n- It includes N (at position 3) and E (at position 4), both in new positions to test.\n- It avoids C, R, A.\n- It introduces new common letters: T, O, S (which are high-frequency and can help narrow down possibilities).\n- It is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>tones</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: tones -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) N(-) E(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'First, I need to review the feedback from previous guesses to understand what we know about the secret word.\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""crane""):  \n- C(x) - not in the word  \n- R(x) - not in the word  \n- A(x) - not in the word  \n- N(-) - in the word but not at position 4  \n- E(-) - in the word but not at position 5  \n\nSo, we know:  \n- Letters not in the word: C, R, A  \n- Letters in the word: N and E, but not at specific positions: N is not at position 4, and E is not at position 5.\n\nFrom Guess 2 (""tones""):  \n- T(x) - not in the word  \n- O(-) - in the word but not at position 2  \n- N(-) - in the word but not at position 3 (since N is repeated, but feedback depends on position)  \n- E(-) - in the word but not at position 4  \n- S(x) - not in the word  \n\nIn ""tones"", positions are:  \n1. T  \n2. O  \n3. N  \n4. E  \n5.

So definitely not present: A, C, R, S, T.\n\nLetters in the word:  \n- N is in the word, but not at position 4 (from guess 1) and not at position 3 (from guess 2).  \n- E is in the word, but not at position 5 (from guess 1) and not at position 4 (from guess 2).  \n- O is in the word, but not at position 2 (from guess 2).\n\nWe also have positions where letters are incorrect. Specifically for N and E:\n\n- N cannot be at position 3 or 4. Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 5.  \n- E cannot be at position 4 or 5. Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3.  \n- O cannot be at position 2. Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but we need to consider overall constraints).\n\nThe word has five positions. We know N, E, and O are in the word, and likely other letters since we have three confirmed letters.\n\nList of known present letters: N, E, O.\n\nAbsent letters: A, C, R, S, T.\n\nFrom feedback, O is in the word but not position 2.\n\nE is in the word but not position 4 or 5, so E must be at position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nN is in the word but not position 3 or 4, so N must be at position 1, 2, or 5.\n\nSince we have multiple present letters, and positions to assign.\n\nAlso, in guess 2, N was at position 3 and E at position 4, but both got ""-"" meaning they are not at those positions; but since we already knew N wasn\'t at position 4 and E not at position 5, the new info is that N isn\'t at position 3 and E isn\'t at position 4.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we need to make a word that uses N, E, O, and two new letters, but avoiding the absent letters.\n\nPossible letters to try: common consonants like L, M, P, D, etc., or vowels like I, U, but we need English words.\n\nWe should aim to test possible positions for N and E.\n\nFor example, E can be at 1,2,3; N at 1,2,5.\n\nBut position 1 can\'t be both E and N, so we need to cover different cases.\n\nAlso, O is somewhere not at position 2.\n\nThe secret word must have exactly these letters: at least N, E, O, and two more letters that are not A,C,R,S,T.\n\nIn feedback, for guess 2, O got ""-"" at position 2, meaning O is in the word but position is wrong.\n\nNow, let\'s think of possible words that fit the constraints.\n\nFirst, E must be in positions 1,2,3; N in 1,2,5; O can be anywhere except 2.\n\nBut position conflict: if N is at 1, E can\'t be at 1, similarly if E at 1, N can\'t be at 1, etc.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- If E at position 1, then N can be at 2 or 5 (since position 1 taken).  \n- If E at position 2, then N can be at 1 or 5 (position 2 taken, and position 3 not possible for N).  \n- If E at position 3, then N can be at 1,2, or 5.\n\nO can be wherever not taken and not position 2.\n\nThen the remaining two letters need to be filled.\n\nSince we don\'t know the other two letters, we should choose a word that tests common letters and positions.\n\nFor instance, we could try to place E at position 1 to see if it\'s correct.\n\nSimilarly for N at position 5 or 1.\n\nLet\'s think of candidate words.\n\nFirst, ensure we include all known present letters: N, E, O must be in the word. We aren\'t 100% sure there are only three, but based on feedback so far, no indication of more than three, but there could be other letters. In guess 1 and guess 2, we have three ""-"" but that might correspond to the three letters, or there could be more. Actually, in guess 1, two ""-"" for N and E, in guess 2 three ""-"" for O, N, E. Guess 2 had O, N, E all getting ""-"" or possible duplicates, but in this case all distinct, so likely the word has O in addition.\n\nIn guess 1: N and E are present.\n\nGuess 2: O, N, E are present, and N/E again confirm they are present.\n\nSo the secret word contains N, E, O, and two other letters not from A,C,R,S,T.\n\nThe two other letters are unknown; we need to discover them.\n\nSo for the next guess, we should include N, E, O, and two new letters, say from common ones: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, etc.\n\nAlso, we need to avoid placing E at positions 4 or 5, N at positions 3 or 4, and O not at position 2.\n\nBut in the guess, we can place them in possible positions to test.\n\nFor example, let\'s try E at position 1.\n\nIf E is at position 1, then it could be correct or not. But since it must be at 1,2,3, placing at 1 tests that.\n\nSimilarly, N could be at 1,2, or 5; but if E is at 1, N cannot be at 1, so N at 2 or 5.\n\nO not at position 2.\n\nSo if E is at position 1, then word: E _ _ _ _\n\nN must be included, at position 2 or 5.\n\nIf N at position 2: E N _ _ _\n\nThen O cannot be at position 2 since it\'s taken by N, so O at 3,4,5, but position 2 is taken, so O at 3,4,5.\n\nNow fill the blanks.\n\nFor example: E N O _ _ but that might not be valid, like ""ENOL"" is not a common word.\n\n""ENO L"" with L? ""ENOLS"" is a word? ""Enols"" is chemical, but might be accepted.\n\nBetter choose common words.\n\nE at 1, N at 5: E _ _ _ N\n\nThen O at 2,3,4 but not at 2? If O at position 2, feedback said O not at position 2, so O cannot be at 2.\n\nSo if E at 1, and N at 5, then O must be at 3 or 4.\n\nPosition 2 needs a letter.\n\nSay E _ O _ N, with O at 3, and _ at 2 and 4.\n\nBut position 4: if we put a letter there.\n\nWord: E X O Y N\n\nWe need to choose X and Y, not from absent letters.\n\nAbsent: A,C,R,S,T.\n\nPossible letters: say I and L, ""ELOIN"" E L O I N, but ""ELOIN"" means to enclose, not very common.\n\n""EX CON"" but not 5 letters.\n\nDifficult if N is at 5.\n\nPerhaps put E at position 3.\n\nTry E at position 3: then word: _ _ E _ _\n\nN at position 1,2, or 5.\n\nO not at position 2.\n\nFor example, N at position 1: N _ E _ _\n\nThen O not at position 2, so O at position 4 or 5.\n\nPosition 2 needs a letter, position 4 or 5 O.\n\nSay N X E Y O or N X E O Y .\n\nIf O at position 4: N X E O _\n\nOr O at position 5: N X E _ O\n\nFill with letters.\n\nCommon words: ""N I E L O"" not a word.\n\n""NA EVO"" no.\n\n""NOBEL"": N O B E L\n\nPositions: N(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), L(5)\n\nBut O is at position 2? But feedback said O cannot be at position 2. In guess 2, O was at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning O not at position 2. So we cannot place O at position 2.\n\nIn ""NOBEL"", O is at position 2, which is forbidden.\n\nSo if we try ""NOBEL"", O at position 2 would be wrong, so we know it would get ""-"", but we already know that.\n\nBut we want to test new letter positions.\n\nSo avoid position 2 for O.\n\nSimilarly, E cannot be at position 4, but in ""NOBEL"", E is at position 4, which is also forbidden based on previous feedback (in guess 2, E at position E got ""-"", so not at position 4).\n\nIn guess 2, E was at position 4 and got ""-"", so E not at position 4.\n\nSo for E, positions 1,2,3 possible.\n\nFor E in ""NOBEL"" at position 4, which is not allowed, so it would be incorrect.\n\nWe need a word where E is not at 4 or 5, N not at 3 or 4, O not at 2.\n\nLet\'s list possible words.\n\nExample: ""LEMON"" - L E M O N\n\nPositions: L(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5)\n\nNow check constraints:\n\nE is at position 2 - this is possible, since E can be at 1,2,3.\n\nN is at position 5 - possible, since N can be at 1,2,5.\n\nO is at position 4 - possible.\n\nBut letters: L, E, M, O, N. We have E, N, O, and new L and M.\n\nAbsent letters: A,C,R,S,T not used, good.\n\nPosition for E: position 2, which is ok.\n\nPosition for N: position 5, ok.\n\nPosition for O: position 4, not position 2, ok.\n\n""LEMON"" is a common word.\n\nPerhaps ""DEMON"" - D E M O N\n\nPositions: D(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5)\n\nSimilar to above, E at 2, N at 5, O at 4.\n\nGood.\n\nAnother option: ""OVEN"" is 4 letters.\n\n"" ONSET"" but S is absent, S is not in the word, from guess 2 S(x), so S is not in the word.

""INLET"" has T, not allowed.\n\n""NOIS E"" has S, not allowed.\n\n""LOVES"" has S, not allowed.\n\n""MONTE"" has T, not allowed.\n\nSo ""LEMON"" or ""DEMON"" seem good.\n\n""BONEY"" - B O N E Y, positions: B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5)\n\nE at position 4?

Words like ""melon"" (M, E, L, O, N) are similar but E is at position 2 in both, so equivalent.\n- Avoid words like ""noise"" (has S, absent), ""bones"" (has S, absent), or ""honey"" (O at position 2 forbidden).\n\n**Why ""lemon""?**\n- Tests E at position 2: If correct (✓), we lock position 2; if incorrect (-), we know E is still elsewhere (position 1 or 3).\n- Tests N at position 5: Similarly, informs if N is last.\n- Tests O at position 4: New position, could be correct or not.\n- Introduces L and M: If either is in the word, we get positional feedback; if absent (x), we eliminate them.\n- Overall, this maximizes information on positions and new letters while adhering to all constraints.\n\n<guess>lemon</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: tones -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) N(-) E(-) S(x)\nGuess 3: lemon -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) M(x) O(✓) N(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for Guess 3: ""lemon"" -> L(x) E(-) M(x) O(✓) N(-)

Breaking down:
- L: x → not in the word
- E: - → in the word but wrong position (since position 2)
- M: x → not in the word
- O: ✓ → O is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)
- N: - → N is in the word but wrong position (position 5)

From previous feedback, we know:

From Guess 1:
- Letters not in word: C, R, A
- N and E are in word, but not at positions 4 and 5 respectively.

From Guess 2:
- Letters not in word: T, S (added to absent)
- O, N, E are in word (O is new), but:
  - O not at position 2
  - N not at position 3
  - E not at position 4

Now with Guess 3:
- New absent letters: L, M
- O is confirmed at position 4 (✓), so we know O is fixed at position 4.
- E is still in the word but not at position 2 (because in this guess at position 2 it got '-')
- N is in the word but not at position 5 (because at position 5 it got '-')

We also know E cannot be at positions 4 or 5 (from before) and now also not at position 2. Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 3 (since positions: 1,2,3,4,5 — but O is at 4, so available for E are 1,3).

Similarly, N cannot be at positions 3,4 (from before) and now also not at position 5. Therefore, N must be at position 1 or 2.

But position 1 and 2 are available. However, note that E and N might be at the same position? No, since each letter has its own position.

Possible conflicts: If N is at position 1, E cannot be at position 1. Similarly, if E is at position 1, N must be at position 2 (since N cannot be at 3,4,5).

Alternatively, if E is at position 3, then N can be at position 1 or 2.

Similarly, if N is at position 2, E can be at position 1 or 3.

We also know O is fixed at position 4.

Absent letters so far: A, C, R, T, S, L, M.

Present letters: E, N, O (and we have O at position 4).

Since O is fixed at position 4, and we know two more letters are present: E and N, but there must be two additional unknown letters? The word has 5 positions:

Position 1: unknown
Position 2: unknown
Position 3: unknown
Position 4: O (fixed)
Position 5: unknown

But we know E and N must be in the word, so among positions 1,2,3,5, two are taken by E and N, and the other two are new letters not absent.

Therefore, we need to fill positions 1,2,3,5 with E, N, and two more letters (since there are four positions and two known letters E and N, so two unknowns).

List of absent letters: A, C, R, T, S, L, M. So available letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Position constraints:
- E: must be at position 1 or 3 (since 2,4,5 forbidden)
- N: must be at position 1 or 2 (since 3,4,5 forbidden)

But note: position 1 can only have one letter. So:
- If position 1 is E, then:
   - E at 1 (position 1)
   - N must be at position 2 (only possibility left for N)
   - Then position 3 and 5 must be two new letters.
- If position 1 is N, then:
   - N at 1
   - E must be at position 3 (only, because position 1 and 2 might be taken? Position 2 is free for E? But E cannot be at position 2? From Guess 3, E was at position 2 and got '-', so E cannot be at position 2.

Therefore, E cannot be at position 2? Yes, from Guess 3, E at position 2 gave '-', meaning E is in the word but not position 2. So E cannot be at positions 2,4,5. Therefore positions 1 or 3.

Similarly, N cannot be at positions 3,4,5 — so only 1 or 2.

Now, conflict resolution:

Case 1: E at position 1 → then N must be at position 2 (the only remaining option for N).

Case 2: N at position 1 → then E must be at position 3 (because E cannot be at position 2, and position 1 taken).

Case 3: E at position 3 → then N must be at position 1 or 2.

But if E at position 3 and N at position 1, that fits. Or E at position 3 and N at position 2.

So actually:

Possible scenarios:

1. E at 1, N at 2:
   - Positions: E(1), N(2), ?, O(4), ?

2. N at 1, E at 3:
   - Positions: N(1), ?, E(3), O(4), ?

3. E at 3, N at 2:
   - Positions: ?, N(2), E(3), O(4), ?

In all cases, we need to fill the remaining positions with letters not absent.

For the next guess, we should aim to test which scenario it is and uncover the missing letters.

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that fits one of these patterns and introduces new common letters.

Let's list candidate words for each scenario, using common letters from the available ones.

Available letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Common letters: H, I, D, G, B, etc.

Case 1: E at 1, N at 2 → positions: E N _ O _

We need two letters for position 3 and 5.

Possible words: 
- ""EN D O W"" → ""ENDOW"" but we know from previous that D might not be tested? ""ENDOW"" uses D and W.
- Or ""EN I O L"" not word.
- ""ENVOY"" has V, Y. Positions: E(1), N(2), V(3), O(4), Y(5). Available letters? V and Y are possible.
- ""ENHYP"" not word.

Case 2: N at 1, E at 3 → N _ E O _

Need positions: 2 and 5.

Words: ""N U E O P"" not word.
- ""N I E O N"" has two N? Not allowed? But not necessarily. ""NIHON"" not word.
- ""N H E O W"" ""NHEOW"" no.
- ""NIC E O"" not.
- Better: ""N I E O"" not 5. ""N I E L O"" not word.
- "" D E E O"" not.
- ""K E E O"" not.
- ""N D E O W"" ""NDEOW"" not a word.
- ""NODE"" but O not at 4? ""N O D E"" is 4 letters.
- ""NINEO"" no.

Actually, common word: ""N I E N O"" not.

Another: ""N V E O"" no.

Difficult: perhaps ""NEIGH"" but no O.

Not having O at position 4 fixed? O is already at position 4.

For case 2: positions: N(1), ?(2), E(3), O(4), ?(5)

Candidate word: ""N I E O L"" not word.

"" N U E O "" not.

"" N A E O"" but A absent.

""NOTE"" 4 letters.

Perhaps ""NUD E O"" not.

""NAIVE"" has A and V? But A absent.

This is tough.

Case 3: E at 3, N at 2 → positions: ?(1) N(2) E(3) O(4) ?(5)

So word: X N E O Y

We need X and Y from available letters.

Common words: ""U N E O Y"" not.
""IN E O"" not.
""ONE"" is 3.
""AN E O"" not.
"" N E O N"" has two N? ""NE O N"" with X at 1 and Y at5? ""ON EON"" not a word.

""KN E O W"" ""KNOWE"" is a word? Knowe means hill, Scottish? Might not be common.

Alternatively, ""ONE"" with prefix.

Perhaps ""B N E O W"" ""BNOEW"" no.

Better: ""UNDEN"" not.

Word: ""ON IE"" not.

Perhaps ""UN D E O"" not 5.

Another idea: "" ANODE"" but A absent and O not at 4? In ""ANODE"", O is position 3? Not.

No common word comes to mind for case 3.

Perhaps Case 1 is more plausible.

But we also have Case 2: ""N I E O"" not working.

Actually, a common word for Case 2: ""N I E C E"" not 5 and C absent.

""PI E C E"" P I E C E, but C absent.

Not.

Another common word: ""D E N O"" not.

Perhaps ""N I E O"" is not common, so maybe Case 2 is rarer.

Now for Case 3: X N E O Y

Common word: "" INK E O"" not.
"" U N E O"" not.
"" B N E O W"" no.

""ON E R O"" not 5 separate.

""ONE"" combined? ""O N E R A"" not.

Perhaps ""UNZ E O"" no.

This is problematic.

Maybe we missed a scenario.

E at 3 and N at 1 is also possible: that is case 2.

Or E at 1 and N at 2 is case 1.

E at 3 and N at 2 is case 3.

But case 3 is: position 1: unknown, position 2: N, position 3: E, position 4: O, position 5: unknown.

Common word: ""AN E O"" but A absent.

"" DIN E O"" not.

""PHON E"" but P H O, O should be at 4? ""PHONE"" has O at 3? Positions: P H O N E, O at 3, not 4.

Not.

""ONCE"" 4 letters.

""ION"" 3 letters.

Perhaps ""GEN O E"" not, ""GENOA"" has G E N O A, but A absent? and O at position 4? ""GENOA"": G(1) E(2) N(3) O(4) A(5). But E is at position 2? But in this scenario for case 3, E is at position 3? Not matching.

We are choosing a word to guess, not the secret word.

For the guess, we need to have E and N at their possible positions.

For example, we know O is fixed at position 4, so in the guess, we must have O at position 4.

Then for E and N, we need to place them at their possible positions.

But for case 3, if we try to guess a word with pattern _ N E O _

For example: ""B N E O W"" not word.
"" K N E O W"" not.
"" UN E O "" not.
""ONE"" not.

There is ""ON K E Y"" not.

Perhaps ""WINE O"" not.

Common word: ""UNLED"" U N L E D, but O not included.

Must include O.

So not.

""OILED"" has O and E but O not at position 4? Positions: O I L E D, O at 1.

Not.

Because we must have O at position 4.

So for the guess, position 4 must be O.

Then position 2 and 3: we are free to put other letters, but E and N must be in the word.

Let's list possible words that have O at position 4, and contain E and N, and no absent letters.

Possible words:
- ""BE O N E"" not 5.
- ""D E N O W"" not word.
- ""END O W"" not, because O must be at 4, so ""ENDOW"" is E N D O W, so O at position 4? Pos: E(1) N(2) D(3) O(4) W(5). This fits the pattern, and in this case, E at 1, N at 2, O at 4, and D and W.

""ENDOW"" is a valid English word.

Now, in this word, we have E at position 1 and N at position 2, which is case 1.

If we are in case 2 or 3, we can use a word that fits those.

For case 2: pattern N _ E O _ , with O at position 4.

Example: ""N U E O"" not.
"" N I E O "" not.
"" N K E O"" not.
"" N D E O W"" ""NDEOW"" not a word.

Perhaps ""NIMED"" but no O.

Not common.

For case 3: pattern _ N E O _ , O at position 4.

Example: ""U N E O "" not.
"" I N E O "" not.
"" INE O A"" not.
""B N E O W"" not.

""UNLIT"" no O.

So the only common word that fits is ""ENDOW"", which has E at 1, N at 2, O at 4, and D and W at 3 and 5.

""ENDOW"" is valid.

But note: in ""ENDOW"", E is at position 1 and N at position 2.

This corresponds to case 1.

It could be that the secret word is not this pattern, but by guessing ""ENDOW"", we can get feedback on the positions of E and N.

If the secret word has E at position 1 and N at position 2, then we might get both correct or some positional.

But in the current state, ""ENDOW"" uses D and W, which are new letters.

If we guess ""ENDOW"", and it is not the word, we might eliminate D and W or get feedback on E and N positions.

Since we have to include E, N, O, and O fixed at position 4, and ""ENDOW"" satisfies E at 1 and N at 2 (both unexcluded positions).

Additionally, we can consider other words like ""P E N O D"" ""PEN O D"" not a standard word; ""PENED"" or ""PEN O"" not.

""GEN O"" not.

""DEN O M"" ""DENOM"" not common.

So ""ENDOW"" seems the best choice.

But let's not forget that there is case 2: where N at position 1 and E at position 3.

Pattern: N ? E O ?

Common word: ""N O E L"" not, O at wrong position.
"" N I E O "" is 4 letters.

""N O E I"" not.

"" N A E O "" no A.

"" N U E O "" not a word.

"" N D E O W"" not a word? ""NDEOW"" not. But ""ENDOW"" reshuffled.

Another word: ""N I E O"" with a D? ""NIEd O"" not.

Perhaps ""N D E O K"" no.

It's hard, so maybe case 2 is less likely, and case 1 or case 3 might be guessed with ""ENDOW"" or similar.

For case 3, pattern: pos1: ?, pos2: N, pos3: E, pos4: O, pos5: ?

Word: ""UNSEO"" not word, and S absent.
""IN D E O"" not.
"" KN E O W"" ""KNOWE"" as before, or ""KNE O W"" not.

"" BON E D"" ""BONED"" positions: B O N E D → O at position 2, which is forbidden (O cannot be at position 2). So not.

"" CONE D"" has C absent.

So I think ""ENDOW"" is a good guess for this situation.

Even though it assumes case 1, it will give us information.

And it uses common letters.

So we'll guess ""ENDOW"".

But in ""ENDOW"", positions are fixed: E(1), N(2), D(3), O(4), W(5)

Which tests E at position 1 and N at position 2.

We know E cannot be at position 5 or 4, and in this case at position 1.

Similarly, N at position 2.

O at position 4 is fixed and will get ✓.

D and W are new.

So good.

<guess>endow</guess>

Step-by-step:

From feedback:
- O is confirmed at position 4.
- E must be at 1 or 3.
- N must be at 1 or 2.
- If E is at 1, N must be at 2 (since N cannot be at higher positions).
- ""endow"" is a valid word that tests E at position 1 and N at position 2, while keeping O at position 4.
- New letters D and W help probe for the remaining letters.

Thus, ""endow"" is an optimal guess.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Thought Process

To make the next guess, I need to consolidate all feedback from previous guesses to identify the constraints for the secret word:

1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):**  
   - C(x), R(x), A(x) → Letters **C, R, A** are absent from the word.  
   - N(–), E(–) → **N** and **E** are in the word, but not at position 4 or 5, respectively.  

2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (""tones""):**  
   - T(x), S(x) → Letters **T** and **S** are absent.  
   - O(–), N(–), E(–) → **O** is in the word (newly confirmed), but not at position 2. **N** is not at position 3 (new constraint). **E** is not at position 4 (new constraint).  

3. **Feedback from Guess 3 (""lemon""):**  
   - L(x), M(x) → Letters **L** and **M** are absent.  
   - E(–) → **E** is in the word but not at position 2.  
   - O(✓) → **O** is confirmed at position 4 (correct position).  
   - N(–) → **N** is in the word but not at position 5.  

**Consolidated Constraints:**  
- **Absent Letters:** A, C, L, M, R, S, T (cannot be in the word).  
- **Present Letters:**  
  - **O** is fixed at position 4 (from O(✓) in ""lemon"").  
  - **E** must be in the word but cannot be at positions 2, 4, or 5. Thus, E must be at position 1 or 3.  
  - **N** must be in the word but cannot be at positions 3, 4, or 5. Thus, N must be at position 1 or 2.  
- **Positional Conflicts:** Since O is at position 4, positions 1–3 and 5 must accommodate E and N, plus two additional unknown letters:  
  - If E is at position 1, N must be at position 2 (since N cannot be elsewhere).  
  - If E is at position 3, N must be at position 1 or 2.  
  - If N is at position 1, E must be at position 3 (since E cannot be elsewhere).  

**Strategy for Next Guess:**  
- Must include **O at position 4** and satisfy positional constraints for **E** and **N**.  
- Must avoid all absent letters (A, C, L, M, R, S, T).  
- Should introduce new common letters to test for the unknown positions and letters (e.g., vowels like I, U, or consonants like B, D, G, H).  
- Given the constraints, focusing on high-frequency English words that test E at position 1 or N at position 2 is efficient, as it resolves positional ambiguities fast.  

**Candidate Words Evaluation:**  
- Consider ""endow"" (E at position 1, N at position 2, O at position 4):  
  - Fits the constraint where E at 1 forces N to position 2 (one likely scenario).  
  - Uses new letters D (position 3) and W (position 5), which are common and untested.  
  - Valid English word (means to provide or equip).  
- Alternatives like ""bingo"" or ""hinge"" are invalid due to constraints (e.g., ""bingo"" has G and B but O not at position 4; ""hinge"" has H and G but no O and positions misaligned).  
- ""Endow"" maximizes information:  
  - If E is confirmed at position 1 (✓), or at wrong position (–), it locks E.  
  - Similarly for N at position 2.  
  - Tests D and W (if absent, they're eliminated).  

**Conclusion:**  
""Endow"" is chosen as it tests the most likely positions for E and N while utilizing O at position 4 and probing for the remaining letters.

<guess>endow</guess>",endow,"We are given feedback for Guess 3: ""lemon"" -> L(x) E(-) M(x) O(✓) N(-)

Breaking down:
- L: x → not in the word
- E: - → in the word but wrong position (since position 2)
- M: x → not in the word
- O: ✓ → O is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)
- N: - → N is in the word but wrong position (position 5)

From previous feedback, we know:

From Guess 1:
- Letters not in word: C, R, A
- N and E are in word, but not at positions 4 and 5 respectively.

From Guess 2:
- Letters not in word: T, S (added to absent)
- O, N, E are in word (O is new), but:
  - O not at position 2
  - N not at position 3
  - E not at position 4

Now with Guess 3:
- New absent letters: L, M
- O is confirmed at position 4 (✓), so we know O is fixed at position 4.
- E is still in the word but not at position 2 (because in this guess at position 2 it got '-')
- N is in the word but not at position 5 (because at position 5 it got '-')

We also know E cannot be at positions 4 or 5 (from before) and now also not at position 2. Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 3 (since positions: 1,2,3,4,5 — but O is at 4, so available for E are 1,3).

Similarly, N cannot be at positions 3,4 (from before) and now also not at position 5. Therefore, N must be at position 1 or 2.

But position 1 and 2 are available. However, note that E and N might be at the same position? No, since each letter has its own position.

Possible conflicts: If N is at position 1, E cannot be at position 1. Similarly, if E is at position 1, N must be at position 2 (since N cannot be at 3,4,5).

Alternatively, if E is at position 3, then N can be at position 1 or 2.

Similarly, if N is at position 2, E can be at position 1 or 3.

We also know O is fixed at position 4.

Absent letters so far: A, C, R, T, S, L, M.

Present letters: E, N, O (and we have O at position 4).

Since O is fixed at position 4, and we know two more letters are present: E and N, but there must be two additional unknown letters? The word has 5 positions:

Position 1: unknown
Position 2: unknown
Position 3: unknown
Position 4: O (fixed)
Position 5: unknown

But we know E and N must be in the word, so among positions 1,2,3,5, two are taken by E and N, and the other two are new letters not absent.

Therefore, we need to fill positions 1,2,3,5 with E, N, and two more letters (since there are four positions and two known letters E and N, so two unknowns).

List of absent letters: A, C, R, T, S, L, M. So available letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Position constraints:
- E: must be at position 1 or 3 (since 2,4,5 forbidden)
- N: must be at position 1 or 2 (since 3,4,5 forbidden)

But note: position 1 can only have one letter. So:
- If position 1 is E, then:
   - E at 1 (position 1)
   - N must be at position 2 (only possibility left for N)
   - Then position 3 and 5 must be two new letters.
- If position 1 is N, then:
   - N at 1
   - E must be at position 3 (only, because position 1 and 2 might be taken? Position 2 is free for E? But E cannot be at position 2? From Guess 3, E was at position 2 and got '-', so E cannot be at position 2.

Therefore, E cannot be at position 2? Yes, from Guess 3, E at position 2 gave '-', meaning E is in the word but not position 2. So E cannot be at positions 2,4,5. Therefore positions 1 or 3.

Similarly, N cannot be at positions 3,4,5 — so only 1 or 2.

Now, conflict resolution:

Case 1: E at position 1 → then N must be at position 2 (the only remaining option for N).

Case 2: N at position 1 → then E must be at position 3 (because E cannot be at position 2, and position 1 taken).

Case 3: E at position 3 → then N must be at position 1 or 2.

But if E at position 3 and N at position 1, that fits. Or E at position 3 and N at position 2.

So actually:

Possible scenarios:

1. E at 1, N at 2:
   - Positions: E(1), N(2), ?, O(4), ?

2. N at 1, E at 3:
   - Positions: N(1), ?, E(3), O(4), ?

3. E at 3, N at 2:
   - Positions: ?, N(2), E(3), O(4), ?

In all cases, we need to fill the remaining positions with letters not absent.

For the next guess, we should aim to test which scenario it is and uncover the missing letters.

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that fits one of these patterns and introduces new common letters.

Let's list candidate words for each scenario, using common letters from the available ones.

Available letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Common letters: H, I, D, G, B, etc.

Case 1: E at 1, N at 2 → positions: E N _ O _

We need two letters for position 3 and 5.

Possible words: 
- ""EN D O W"" → ""ENDOW"" but we know from previous that D might not be tested? ""ENDOW"" uses D and W.
- Or ""EN I O L"" not word.
- ""ENVOY"" has V, Y. Positions: E(1), N(2), V(3), O(4), Y(5). Available letters? V and Y are possible.
- ""ENHYP"" not word.

Case 2: N at 1, E at 3 → N _ E O _

Need positions: 2 and 5.

Words: ""N U E O P"" not word.
- ""N I E O N"" has two N? Not allowed? But not necessarily. ""NIHON"" not word.
- ""N H E O W"" ""NHEOW"" no.
- ""NIC E O"" not.
- Better: ""N I E O"" not 5. ""N I E L O"" not word.
- "" D E E O"" not.
- ""K E E O"" not.
- ""N D E O W"" ""NDEOW"" not a word.
- ""NODE"" but O not at 4? ""N O D E"" is 4 letters.
- ""NINEO"" no.

Actually, common word: ""N I E N O"" not.

Another: ""N V E O"" no.

Difficult: perhaps ""NEIGH"" but no O.

Not having O at position 4 fixed? O is already at position 4.

For case 2: positions: N(1), ?(2), E(3), O(4), ?(5)

Candidate word: ""N I E O L"" not word.

"" N U E O "" not.

"" N A E O"" but A absent.

""NOTE"" 4 letters.

Perhaps ""NUD E O"" not.

""NAIVE"" has A and V? But A absent.

This is tough.

Case 3: E at 3, N at 2 → positions: ?(1) N(2) E(3) O(4) ?(5)

So word: X N E O Y

We need X and Y from available letters.

Common words: ""U N E O Y"" not.
""IN E O"" not.
""ONE"" is 3.
""AN E O"" not.
"" N E O N"" has two N? ""NE O N"" with X at 1 and Y at5? ""ON EON"" not a word.

""KN E O W"" ""KNOWE"" is a word? Knowe means hill, Scottish? Might not be common.

Alternatively, ""ONE"" with prefix.

Perhaps ""B N E O W"" ""BNOEW"" no.

Better: ""UNDEN"" not.

Word: ""ON IE"" not.

Perhaps ""UN D E O"" not 5.

Another idea: "" ANODE"" but A absent and O not at 4? In ""ANODE"", O is position 3? Not.

No common word comes to mind for case 3.

Perhaps Case 1 is more plausible.

But we also have Case 2: ""N I E O"" not working.

Actually, a common word for Case 2: ""N I E C E"" not 5 and C absent.

""PI E C E"" P I E C E, but C absent.

Not.

Another common word: ""D E N O"" not.

Perhaps ""N I E O"" is not common, so maybe Case 2 is rarer.

Now for Case 3: X N E O Y

Common word: "" INK E O"" not.
"" U N E O"" not.
"" B N E O W"" no.

""ON E R O"" not 5 separate.

""ONE"" combined? ""O N E R A"" not.

Perhaps ""UNZ E O"" no.

This is problematic.

Maybe we missed a scenario.

E at 3 and N at 1 is also possible: that is case 2.

Or E at 1 and N at 2 is case 1.

E at 3 and N at 2 is case 3.

But case 3 is: position 1: unknown, position 2: N, position 3: E, position 4: O, position 5: unknown.

Common word: ""AN E O"" but A absent.

"" DIN E O"" not.

""PHON E"" but P H O, O should be at 4? ""PHONE"" has O at 3? Positions: P H O N E, O at 3, not 4.

Not.

""ONCE"" 4 letters.

""ION"" 3 letters.

Perhaps ""GEN O E"" not, ""GENOA"" has G E N O A, but A absent? and O at position 4? ""GENOA"": G(1) E(2) N(3) O(4) A(5). But E is at position 2? But in this scenario for case 3, E is at position 3? Not matching.

We are choosing a word to guess, not the secret word.

For the guess, we need to have E and N at their possible positions.

For example, we know O is fixed at position 4, so in the guess, we must have O at position 4.

Then for E and N, we need to place them at their possible positions.

But for case 3, if we try to guess a word with pattern _ N E O _

For example: ""B N E O W"" not word.
"" K N E O W"" not.
"" UN E O "" not.
""ONE"" not.

There is ""ON K E Y"" not.

Perhaps ""WINE O"" not.

Common word: ""UNLED"" U N L E D, but O not included.

Must include O.

So not.

""OILED"" has O and E but O not at position 4? Positions: O I L E D, O at 1.

Not.

Because we must have O at position 4.

So for the guess, position 4 must be O.

Then position 2 and 3: we are free to put other letters, but E and N must be in the word.

Let's list possible words that have O at position 4, and contain E and N, and no absent letters.

Possible words:
- ""BE O N E"" not 5.
- ""D E N O W"" not word.
- ""END O W"" not, because O must be at 4, so ""ENDOW"" is E N D O W, so O at position 4? Pos: E(1) N(2) D(3) O(4) W(5). This fits the pattern, and in this case, E at 1, N at 2, O at 4, and D and W.

""ENDOW"" is a valid English word.

Now, in this word, we have E at position 1 and N at position 2, which is case 1.

If we are in case 2 or 3, we can use a word that fits those.

For case 2: pattern N _ E O _ , with O at position 4.

Example: ""N U E O"" not.
"" N I E O "" not.
"" N K E O"" not.
"" N D E O W"" ""NDEOW"" not a word.

Perhaps ""NIMED"" but no O.

Not common.

For case 3: pattern _ N E O _ , O at position 4.

Example: ""U N E O "" not.
"" I N E O "" not.
"" INE O A"" not.
""B N E O W"" not.

""UNLIT"" no O.

So the only common word that fits is ""ENDOW"", which has E at 1, N at 2, O at 4, and D and W at 3 and 5.

""ENDOW"" is valid.

But note: in ""ENDOW"", E is at position 1 and N at position 2.

This corresponds to case 1.

It could be that the secret word is not this pattern, but by guessing ""ENDOW"", we can get feedback on the positions of E and N.

If the secret word has E at position 1 and N at position 2, then we might get both correct or some positional.

But in the current state, ""ENDOW"" uses D and W, which are new letters.

If we guess ""ENDOW"", and it is not the word, we might eliminate D and W or get feedback on E and N positions.

Since we have to include E, N, O, and O fixed at position 4, and ""ENDOW"" satisfies E at 1 and N at 2 (both unexcluded positions).

Additionally, we can consider other words like ""P E N O D"" ""PEN O D"" not a standard word; ""PENED"" or ""PEN O"" not.

""GEN O"" not.

""DEN O M"" ""DENOM"" not common.

So ""ENDOW"" seems the best choice.

But let's not forget that there is case 2: where N at position 1 and E at position 3.

Pattern: N ? E O ?

Common word: ""N O E L"" not, O at wrong position.
"" N I E O "" is 4 letters.

""N O E I"" not.

"" N A E O "" no A.

"" N U E O "" not a word.

"" N D E O W"" not a word? ""NDEOW"" not. But ""ENDOW"" reshuffled.

Another word: ""N I E O"" with a D? ""NIEd O"" not.

Perhaps ""N D E O K"" no.

It's hard, so maybe case 2 is less likely, and case 1 or case 3 might be guessed with ""ENDOW"" or similar.

For case 3, pattern: pos1: ?, pos2: N, pos3: E, pos4: O, pos5: ?

Word: ""UNSEO"" not word, and S absent.
""IN D E O"" not.
"" KN E O W"" ""KNOWE"" as before, or ""KNE O W"" not.

"" BON E D"" ""BONED"" positions: B O N E D → O at position 2, which is forbidden (O cannot be at position 2). So not.

"" CONE D"" has C absent.

So I think ""ENDOW"" is a good guess for this situation.

Even though it assumes case 1, it will give us information.

And it uses common letters.

So we'll guess ""ENDOW"".

But in ""ENDOW"", positions are fixed: E(1), N(2), D(3), O(4), W(5)

Which tests E at position 1 and N at position 2.

We know E cannot be at position 5 or 4, and in this case at position 1.

Similarly, N at position 2.

O at position 4 is fixed and will get ✓.

D and W are new.

So good.

<guess>endow</guess>

Step-by-step:

From feedback:
- O is confirmed at position 4.
- E must be at 1 or 3.
- N must be at 1 or 2.
- If E is at 1, N must be at 2 (since N cannot be at higher positions).
- ""endow"" is a valid word that tests E at position 1 and N at position 2, while keeping O at position 4.
- New letters D and W help probe for the remaining letters.

Thus, ""endow"" is an optimal guess.### Step-by-Step Thought Process

To make the next guess, I need to consolidate all feedback from previous guesses to identify the constraints for the secret word:

1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):**  
   - C(x), R(x), A(x) → Letters **C, R, A** are absent from the word.  
   - N(–), E(–) → **N** and **E** are in the word, but not at position 4 or 5, respectively.  

2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (""tones""):**  
   - T(x), S(x) → Letters **T** and **S** are absent.  
   - O(–), N(–), E(–) → **O** is in the word (newly confirmed), but not at position 2. **N** is not at position 3 (new constraint). **E** is not at position 4 (new constraint).  

3. **Feedback from Guess 3 (""lemon""):**  
   - L(x), M(x) → Letters **L** and **M** are absent.  
   - E(–) → **E** is in the word but not at position 2.  
   - O(✓) → **O** is confirmed at position 4 (correct position).  
   - N(–) → **N** is in the word but not at position 5.  

**Consolidated Constraints:**  
- **Absent Letters:** A, C, L, M, R, S, T (cannot be in the word).  
- **Present Letters:**  
  - **O** is fixed at position 4 (from O(✓) in ""lemon"").  
  - **E** must be in the word but cannot be at positions 2, 4, or 5. Thus, E must be at position 1 or 3.  
  - **N** must be in the word but cannot be at positions 3, 4, or 5. Thus, N must be at position 1 or 2.  
- **Positional Conflicts:** Since O is at position 4, positions 1–3 and 5 must accommodate E and N, plus two additional unknown letters:  
  - If E is at position 1, N must be at position 2 (since N cannot be elsewhere).  
  - If E is at position 3, N must be at position 1 or 2.  
  - If N is at position 1, E must be at position 3 (since E cannot be elsewhere).  

**Strategy for Next Guess:**  
- Must include **O at position 4** and satisfy positional constraints for **E** and **N**.  
- Must avoid all absent letters (A, C, L, M, R, S, T).  
- Should introduce new common letters to test for the unknown positions and letters (e.g., vowels like I, U, or consonants like B, D, G, H).  
- Given the constraints, focusing on high-frequency English words that test E at position 1 or N at position 2 is efficient, as it resolves positional ambiguities fast.  

**Candidate Words Evaluation:**  
- Consider ""endow"" (E at position 1, N at position 2, O at position 4):  
  - Fits the constraint where E at 1 forces N to position 2 (one likely scenario).  
  - Uses new letters D (position 3) and W (position 5), which are common and untested.  
  - Valid English word (means to provide or equip).  
- Alternatives like ""bingo"" or ""hinge"" are invalid due to constraints (e.g., ""bingo"" has G and B but O not at position 4; ""hinge"" has H and G but no O and positions misaligned).  
- ""Endow"" maximizes information:  
  - If E is confirmed at position 1 (✓), or at wrong position (–), it locks E.  
  - Similarly for N at position 2.  
  - Tests D and W (if absent, they're eliminated).  

**Conclusion:**  
""Endow"" is chosen as it tests the most likely positions for E and N while utilizing O at position 4 and probing for the remaining letters.",Guess 4: endow -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(✓) D(✓) O(✓) W(✓),SUCCESS
