We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
 Interpretation:
   - The letter 'C' is in the correct position (position 1).
   - The letters 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
   - Starts with 'C'
   - Does not contain the letters: R, A, N, E

 Since the secret word starts with 'C' and the other letters in ""crane"" (positions 2-5) are absent, we need to guess a new word.

 Constraints for the next guess:
   - Must be a 5-letter English word starting with 'C'
   - Must not contain R, A, N, E

 With the feedback, we know the first letter is C, so the word must be C _ _ _ _

 Now, we want to maximize information by trying new letters to cover more possibilities.

 Common letters that are not in the first guess (avoiding R,A,N,E): 
   We can consider letters like B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since vowels are important, we note that the word must have some vowels. We used A and E and they are absent. So we try other vowels: O, U, I, Y (as vowel).

 A good starting point might be to include one or two more vowels and some common consonants.

 We also note that we have only one letter fixed (C at position 1). So we are trying to figure out the remaining four letters.

 Possible words starting with C that don't contain R,A,N,E.

 Let's think of words: 
   Example: ""COILS"", ""COULD"", ""CHUMP"", ""CLIMB"", etc.

 But we don't know if the word has 'O' or 'U', etc. So we should try a word that tests several new letters.

 Let me try to choose a word with distinct letters and covering frequent letters.

 I'll try ""CHUMP"": 
   C is fixed (so we know position 1 is correct), then H,U,M,P.

 But wait, we already know C is fixed so the feedback for C in position 1 will be correct again. We can skip C and focus on other letters.

 Actually, in our guess we must start with C because we know it's correct. So our guess must be C followed by four new letters.

 We are constrained: we cannot use R, A, N, E in the next guess.

 So, for example, ""COULD"" would be a candidate: C O U L D -> letters: O,U,L,D (all new).

 But note: we don't have any information yet about these letters.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that tests multiple vowels: for instance, ""COVET"" uses O and E? Wait, E is forbidden because it is already known absent.

 So avoid E: ""COVET"" has E -> not allowed.

 Another word: ""COILS"" -> C O I L S -> letters O, I, L, S (all new).

 Or ""CHIPS"": C H I P S -> letters H, I, P, S.

 Let me think: we have only 6 tries, so we need to get as much information as possible.

 Since R,A,N,E are out, let me choose a word that has common consonants and vowels that haven't been tried.

 I'll go with ""COILS"". It has two vowels (O and I) and two consonants (L and S). 

 So guess: ""COILS""

 But note: we are not sure if O or I are in the word. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses more common consonants: ""CHIPS"" (H,P,S are common).

 However, we don't know which letters are present.

 After thinking, I'll choose ""COILS"".

 So the next guess is ""coils"".

 However, let me check if ""coils"" is acceptable. Yes.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓)

This means:  
1. The secret word starts with **C**.  
2. The word does **not** contain R, A, N, or E.  

For the next guess, I must:  
- Start with **C** and use 4 new letters not yet tested.  
- Avoid R, A, N, E entirely.  
- Prioritize common letters and vowels not ruled out (e.g., I, O, U, L, S, T).

We are given feedback from two guesses:

1. For ""crane"": C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - This tells us:
        - The first letter is C (correct and in position 1).
        - The letters R, A, N, E are not present in the secret word at all.

2. For ""coils"": C(✓) O(x) I(x) L(x) S(x)
   - This tells us:
        - The first letter is C (already known).
        - The letters O, I, L, S are not present in the secret word at all.

Therefore, combining the information:

- The secret word starts with C.
- The word does not contain any of the following letters: R, A, N, E, O, I, L, S.

Now, we need to make a new guess that is a 5-letter word starting with C and avoiding the forbidden letters: R,A,N,E,O,I,L,S.

Available letters: We must use letters from the remaining alphabet:
    B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Also, note that we have no information about positions 2 to 5 yet.

We want to maximize information by trying new, common letters. Since vowels are limited (we've ruled out A,E,I,O), we must use U or Y as vowels.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, V, W

We should form a word that starts with C and uses four letters from the available set.

Possible words:
Examples of words starting with C that use only the allowed letters:

- ""CUBED"": but E is forbidden -> invalid because E is absent
- ""CUTUP"": has U and T, P -> allowed? But T and P are allowed. But wait: ""CUTUP"" is 5 letters? C,U,T,U,P -> invalid because duplicate U and it's a word? Actually ""cutup"" is a word but we need distinct letters? No, the game allows repeated letters? But in feedback, if a letter appears multiple times, each is checked independently. However, we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters.

But to avoid complications, we might prefer words with distinct letters to maximize information.

However, since we are limited by available letters, we might have to use words without distinct letters.

Let's list possible words:

- ""CHUMP"": letters C,H,U,M,P -> H,U,M,P are allowed? Check: H, U, M, P are not in the forbidden list (R,A,N,E,O,I,L,S). So yes.
- ""CHUMP"": H, U, M, P are all new.

Another: ""CUMIN"" -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.

Another: ""CRUMP"" -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.

Another: ""CLUMP"" -> L is forbidden -> invalid.

Another: ""CHAMP"" -> A forbidden -> invalid.

Another: ""CUTUP"": letters C,U,T,U,P -> note the two U's. This is a valid English word? But it's not a standard word. We should avoid words with duplicate letters unless necessary? Actually, ""cutup"" is accepted as a word.

But perhaps better to choose words with unique letters.

Another: ""CUTIE"" -> E forbidden -> invalid.

Another: ""DUCHY"" -> doesn't start with C -> invalid.

We need words starting with C.

Possible: ""CHUMP"", ""CHIMP"" (H,I but I is forbidden -> invalid because I is in the forbidden list? Yes from guess 2).

Forbidden letters: R,A,N,E,O,I,L,S.

So in ""CHIMP"", I is forbidden, so invalid.

Another: ""CHUFF"" -> H,U,F,F -> duplicate F. Also, F is allowed? Since not forbidden? Yes.

But duplicate F might be less informative? Actually, if F is not in the secret, then we get two 'x', so we know F is not present. If F is present, we get feedback accordingly.

But we can try.

Another: ""CUBBY"" -> B is allowed? Yes. But duplicate B? And U,B,B,Y -> duplicate B.

Another: ""CABBAGE"" -> too long? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words:

- ""CATCH"": letters C,A,T,C,H -> but A is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""PATCH"" -> doesn't start with C.

We need C first.

How about: ""CUTTY"" -> letters C,U,T,T,Y -> duplicate T? Yes.

Another: ""CUBIT"" -> letters C,U,B,I,T -> but I is forbidden -> invalid.

Another: ""CUBED"" -> E forbidden -> invalid.

Another: ""CYSTS"" -> letters C,Y,S,S,T -> but S is forbidden -> invalid.

Another: ""CHUNK"": letters C,H,U,N,K -> N is forbidden -> invalid.

Another: ""CHUMMY"": M and Y, but duplicate M? And it has M: C,H,U,M,M,Y -> that's 6 letters? No, chummy is 6 letters. So not 5.

Another: ""CHUFT"" -> not a common word.

Better to stick to common words.

List of allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible words:

- ""CUTUP"": U, T, P -> but duplicate U? Also, is ""cutup"" valid? Yes, it is a noun meaning a film editing technique or a joker. But let's see if we can avoid duplicates.

- ""CHUMP"": C,H,U,M,P -> H,U,M,P are distinct and allowed.

- ""CHUMP"" is a valid English word: meaning a foolish person.

Another: ""CUPID"" -> contains I? I is forbidden -> invalid.

Another: ""CUMIN"" -> N forbidden -> invalid.

Another: ""CHUCK"": C,H,U,C,K -> note: duplicate C? But the first C is fixed. So letters in positions: 2-H, 3-U, 4-C, 5-K. Now, C is the first letter and also in the 4th position? We don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters.

But check forbidden: H,U,C,K. C is allowed? Only R,A,N,E,O,I,L,S are forbidden, so C is allowed? Actually, we know C is in the word (in position1), but if we put C in position 4, that would be allowed? Yes, because the secret word might have multiple C's? But note: in the first guess, we had C in position 1, and we didn't get any information that C is in the word multiple times? Actually, the feedback only marks correct and present positions.

Wait: the secret word might have only one C or multiple. We don't know.

But in our second guess, ""coils"", we had a 'C' in position 1 and got a check. We didn't have any other C. So the secret word might have only one C? Or more? We don't know.

So, guessing a word with duplicate C is possible? Yes.

But in ""CHUCK"": we are using C in position 4. Also, H,U,C,K: H and U are new, K is new? Yes, because in previous guesses we didn't have H,U,K.

But check: does ""chuck"" contain I? No. It contains H,U,C,K. Only C is known to be present. The new letters: H, U, K.

But note: C was already tested and present, so putting C in position 4 might give information: if it's present and correct? Or present but not in the right position? But we don't know if the word has a second C. Alternatively, it might be efficient.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: H, U, K are all not forbidden? Our forbidden set: R,A,N,E,O,I,L,S. So H, U, K are allowed.

So ""CHUCK"" is a candidate. Let's spell: C,H,U,C,K -> so positions: C(1), H(2), U(3), C(4), K(5). 

But note: we are risking that the secret might not have a C in position 4? We could get feedback that C(4) is absent? But if we get an 'x' for position 4, that would imply the secret word has only one C? Or we might get '-' if C is in the word but not that position? 

Actually, the feedback for position 4 would be:

- If the secret has no C beyond the first letter, then we get ✓ for position 1 (C), and for position 4: if C is not present in the secret beyond the known first C? Then it would be marked as x? Because that C is not in the secret word? Wait, but the secret word has at least one C. The presence symbol (-) means the letter is present but in the wrong position. So for the C in position 4:

   - If the secret does not have a C in position 4, and if there is another C somewhere else (which there isn't because we already have C in position1 and we haven't tested other Cs) but suppose the secret has only one C? Then position4 C would be x because it's not present? Actually, since we already used the C in position1, if the secret has only one C, then any other occurrence would be x? 

Actually, the feedback is based on the entire word:

Each letter of the guess is compared independently with the secret.

For ""CHUCK"", the secret word might be ""CROCK"" but note: R and O are forbidden. Our secret word does not contain R,A,N,E,O,I,L,S.

So let's stick to words without forbidden letters.

Another word: ""DUMPT"" -> doesn't start with C.

Back to ""CHUMP"": C H U M P. This uses distinct letters except for C? Wait, C is the first letter and no duplicate. So letters: H,U,M,P. All distinct and new.

Alternatively, ""CHIKI"" -> I is forbidden -> invalid.

Another: ""CUTTY"" -> contains T twice? And Y: C,U,T,T,Y -> U,T,Y are allowed? But duplicate T.

I think ""CHUMP"" is a reasonable choice.

Alternatively, ""CUMUL"" -> not a common word.

Another: ""CYSTS"" -> S forbidden -> invalid.

Another: ""GYPPY"" -> not C.

So let's go with ""CHUMP"".

But note: we are testing H,U,M,P. We hope that at least one of them is present? Since if none are present, we only get the C confirmed and no new data? But that might be worth it.

Alternatively, we can try a word that includes Y, because vowels are scarce: we have U and Y as remaining vowels.

Word: ""CUBBY"" -> contains duplicate B? And Y: C,U,B,B,Y -> B,B: duplicate. Also U is vowel, Y is vowel-like.

But double letters: ""cubby"" is a word (a small room).

But to maximize information, ""CHUMP"" is better because it has four distinct new letters.

So next guess: ""CHUMP""

In the feedback, we'll get:

- Position 1: C(✓) (fixed)

Then for H,U,M,P: each will get either:

   - ✓ : correct letter and position
   - - : letter present but wrong position
   - x : letter not present

We hope to get some hits.

But note: the secret word starts with C and doesn't have any of R,A,N,E,O,I,L,S. And we are testing H,U,M,P.

So secret word possibilities that start with C and avoid forbidden letters? And must be 5 letters.

Possible words: 
   Example: ""CHUMP"", ""CHAMP"" (but A is forbidden), ""CHIPS"" (S forbidden), ""CLAMP"" (L forbidden), ""CRAMP"" (R forbidden), so actually ""CHUMP"" itself is possible? 

But let me think: other words? ""CUTUP"", ""CUMMY"" (but S? not).

Actually, we don't know until we guess.

So I'll go with ""CHUMP"".

Building on previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
- **Guess 2: COILS** → C(✓) O(x) I(x) L(x) S(x)  

### Key Insights:
1. The secret word **starts with C** (position 1 is confirmed ✓).
2. The word **excludes** R, A, N, E (from guess 1), O, I, L, S (from guess 2).  
   - Total excluded letters: **R, A, N, E, O, I, L, S**.
3. Remaining letters for positions 2–5 must come from:  
   **B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  
4. A strong third guess should:
   - Start with **C**.
   - Use high-frequency untested letters (e.g., U for a vowel, H, M, P for consonants).
   - Prioritize distinct letters to maximize feedback coverage.

### Strategy:
- With vowels scarce (A, E, I, O ruled out), **U** and **Y** become critical.  
- ""CHUMP"" tests **H, U, M, P**—common consonants and a vital vowel—to efficiently narrow possibilities.  
- Validates presence/absence in positions 2–5 while avoiding forbidden letters.  

<guess>chump</guess>",chump,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

1. For ""crane"": C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
