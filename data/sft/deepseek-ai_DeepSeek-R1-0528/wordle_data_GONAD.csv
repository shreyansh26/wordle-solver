We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

 So, our first guess will be: CRANE

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
This means:
- C is not in the secret word at all.
- R is not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 3).
- N is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 4).
- E is not in the secret word at all.

Important: The positions matter. In ""crane"":
  Position 1: C -> not in word
  Position 2: R -> not in word
  Position 3: A -> present but wrong position
  Position 4: N -> present but wrong position
  Position 5: E -> not in word

Therefore, the secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively. Also, it does not contain C, R, or E.

We must use this information to make a new guess. The new word must:
1. Be a 5-letter English word.
2. Include the letter A and N (since they are in the word), but not in positions 3 and 4?
   - Actually, A cannot be at position 3 and N cannot be at position 4? Not exactly: The feedback says A is present but not at position 3, which doesn't prevent it from being elsewhere. Similarly for N, it is present but not at position 4, so it must be in one of the other positions (1,2,3,5) but note we have constraints from the previous guess.

Wait, let's clarify: the secret word must have A somewhere, but not at position 3? Actually, the feedback tells us that in our guess, the A that we put at position 3 is actually in the word, but not at that position. So in the secret word, A is at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, N is at position 1,2,3, or 5 (but not 4).

Additionally, the word must not contain C, R, or E.

Now, we can think of common words that include A and N.

We also note that in the first guess, A was guessed at position 3 and N at position 4, but they are elsewhere. So let's try to place A and N in different positions.

Also, we want to test new letters because we have information about A and N. We might want to use other common letters to gain more information.

Common letters besides vowels: S, T, L, etc.

But note: we have used C, R, A, N, E. So avoid those except A and N.

So new letters to try: perhaps S, T, L, I, O, D, etc.

Let me try to come up with a word that has:
- A in position other than 3? Actually, we don't know where A is, so we can put it in any position except 3? Wait no: we know A is in the word, but not at position 3. So we can put A at a position we haven't tried (like 1,2,4,5) to test.

Similarly for N, we can put it at a position other than 4.

But note: we don't want to put both A and N in positions we already know they are not? Actually, we only know they are not in the positions we placed them in the first guess. But since we haven't tried other positions, we can try them.

I think a good strategy would be to place A and N in new positions and include other common letters.

Let us consider placing A in position 1 and N in position 2? Or maybe spread out.

Alternatively, we can pick a word with A and N and avoid C,R,E and also avoid positions that we already know are wrong? Actually, we don't have direct information about other positions.

But note: we know that position 1 cannot be A? Because if A were at position 1, then in the first guess we didn't have A at position 1, but that doesn't prevent the secret word from having A at position 1. Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about position 1 because we guessed C there. We only know that C is not in the word and not at position 1.

Similarly, we know that position 2 must not have R? But R is not in the word at all.

Actually, we have:
- The secret word does not have R at all, so position 2 must be another letter.

So let me summarize:
- The word contains A and N, but not C, R, E.
- The positions: 
   - Position 1: cannot be C (and not A? no, because we haven't tested A at position 1) -> actually, we don't know. We only know that C is not there and the letter is not C.
   - Similarly, position 2: cannot be R, and the letter is not R.
   - Position 3: cannot be A? Actually, the feedback says A is present but not at position 3? That is correct: so A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, position 4: N is in the word but not at position 4? And position 5 is not E.

So we must avoid having A at position 3 and N at position 4? Actually, in our next guess we can avoid placing A at position 3 and N at position 4? But we don't know whether they might be elsewhere. Actually, if we put A at position 3 again, then if it's not correct we'll get '-' again? Or if it is the correct position we get a ✓. But we know A is not at position 3 from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for position 3 was A(-) meaning A is in the word but not in this position. Therefore, A cannot be at position 3? Yes, that's fixed: the secret word does not have A at position 3. Similarly, it does not have N at position 4.

Therefore, in our next guess we must avoid:
- Putting A at position 3? Actually, we can put it anywhere we want to test. But we already know that position 3 is wrong for A? Yes. So we don't want to put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. Similarly for N at position 4.

So the new guess should have A in one of the positions: 1,2,4,5 and N in one of the positions:1,2,3,5.

Moreover, we don't want to reuse the letters that are definitely absent: C,R,E.

Therefore, letters we can use: any letter except C,R,E. And we must include A and N.

Now, we have to choose three more letters. We can choose common letters we haven't tried: such as S, T, L, I, O, D, M, B, etc.

Let me try to construct a word:
Options:
- We can try A at the start? Like ""A"" followed by ...
- Or N at the end? 

But we have to have both A and N.

Common words: how about ""sandy""? 
- Has S, A, N, D, Y. 
- A at position 2 -> which is allowed (not position 3)
- N at position 3 -> allowed (because we don't know about position 3 for N? Actually, N can be at position 3? Yes, because previously it was at position 4 and not there, but position 3 hasn't been tested for N? Actually, we placed N at position 4 and got '-' meaning N is in the word but not at 4. So N could be at position 3? Yes.

But let's check if ""sandy"" meets the constraints:
- Includes A and N? Yes.
- A at position 2? That's okay because we know A isn't at position 3? And we don't know about position 2? So we can test it.
- N at position 4? Wait no: in ""sandy"":
  S (position1), A (position2), N (position3), D (position4), Y (position5)
So N is at position 3? Which is unconfirmed.

But we are going to get feedback: if N is at position 3, we get ✓. Otherwise, if N is in the word but not at 3, we get '-', and then we know N must be elsewhere (position 1,2,5).

But note: we also have to avoid C,R,E? Sandy has none of those. So that's okay.

Alternatively, we can try ""bland"", but then B and L are new. Also: A at position 3? Wait, we cannot place A at position 3? Because we already know A is not at position 3? So we must avoid position 3 for A? Yes, because we got '-' meaning it's not there. So if we put A at position 3 again, it would be incorrect? So we shouldn't do that.

Therefore, ""bland"" would have A at position 3: which we know is not possible? Wait no: the secret word does not have A at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 in our guess, we would get '-' again? And that would be redundant? It wouldn't break the game, but it's inefficient because we already know A is not at position 3.

To avoid redundant information, we should not put A at position 3 and N at position 4. So we want to place A and N in new positions.

In ""sandy"":
- A is at position 2? That's new? Previously A was at position 3? So now we test position 2? That's good.
- N is at position 3? Previously N was at position 4? So now testing position 3? That's good? Yes, because we haven't tried N at position 3.

Or is it? Actually, in the first guess we didn't have any letter at position 1,2,5? So we don't know about A or N at those positions? But in ""sandy"", we have:
Position1: S? We don't know.
Position2: A? We don't know? But we know A is in the word? So if it isn't at position 2? Then we get '-' for A? And then we know it must be at 1,4,5? 

That's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't place A and N adjacent? Or try to cover more common letters.

Another option: ""piano""? But that has P,I,A,N,O. And note: O is a vowel? But we haven't tried O? And E is missing? But we don't care? We are avoiding E? But note: words can have repeated letters? We are not sure? But we don't know? So let's assume no repeated letters? Unless we have evidence? 

The game can have repeated letters? Actually, the rules don't say? But in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? So we cannot assume? But for now, we don't have any information? And ""piano"" has distinct letters? So that's good? Also, ""piano"" has A at position 3? Oh wait, we cannot put A at position 3? Because we know A isn't at position 3? So if we put ""piano"", then A would be at position 3? Which we know is wrong? So we shouldn't do that? Because we would get a '-' and we know that already? So it doesn't give new information? 

Therefore, avoid position 3 for A? So ""piano"" is bad.

How about ""adorn""? 
- A at position 1? New position? 
- D,O,R,N? Wait: R is not allowed? Because feedback said R is not in the word? So ""adorn"" contains R? Which is bad? We cannot use R? 

Another word: ""train""? But has R? And T,R,A,I,N? R again? Not allowed? 

We need words without R and without C and E? 

How about ""saint""? 
- S,A,I,N,T? 
- A at position 2? Which is okay? 
- N at position 4? Wait: we know from the first guess that N is not at position 4? So if we put N at position 4? We would get a '-'? Meaning that if the secret word has N elsewhere? So we will learn that N isn't at position 4? But we already know that? So redundant? 

We should avoid putting N at position 4? Because we know it's not there? 

Therefore, in our next guess we must avoid:
- Position 3 for A? Because we know A isn't at position 3? So in the new word, A should be at 1,2,4, or 5? 
- Position 4 for N? So N should be at 1,2,3, or 5? 

Therefore, ""saint"" is bad? Because it has N at position 4? 

How about ""stain""? 
- S,T,A,I,N? 
- A at position 3? Oh again? We cannot put A at position 3? 

Wait, let me write:
stain: s (1), t (2), a (3), i (4), n (5)? 
So A at position 3? Which is what we must avoid? 

How about ""stank""? 
- S,T,A,N,K? 
- A at position 3? Still bad? 

We want words where A is not at position 3? 

How about ""snail""? 
- S at 1, N at 2? That's allowed for N? We don't know about N at position 2? 
- A at position 3? Again? Bad? 

We might shift? How about ""lacks""? But then C is in it? We know C is not in the word? So ""lacks"" uses C? Forbidden? 

Let me think: A at position 1? Like ""ankle""? But E at the end? We know E is not in the word? So not allowed? 

How about ""aloud""? 
- A,L,O,U,D? 
- Does not include N? We must include N? Because the feedback says N is in the word? 

We must include both A and N? Because the feedback indicates they are in the word? 

So the word must contain A and N? 

Therefore, ""aloud"" is missing N? So invalid? 

How about ""brand""? But has R? And B,R,A,N,D? R is forbidden? 

We need words without C,R,E and with A and N? 

And positioning: 
We want to test A in a new position? Maybe position 1? 

For example, ""angel""? But E is there? And G,L? But E is forbidden? 

""angst""? 
- A,N,G,S,T? 
- A at position 1? That's good? 
- N at position 2? Which is new? 
But note: does it have any forbidden letters? Forbidden: C,R,E? None? So ""angst"" is A, N, G, S, T? And we can use it? 

But what about positions? 
- A at 1: we think it might be? 
- N at 2: we don't know? 

But note: we also must consider that in the first guess, position 4 had an N? And we said it wasn't there? So we are avoiding position 4? In this case, N is at position 2? So that's okay? 

Also, A at position 1? Previously, we had a letter at position 1? It was C? Which is not in the word? So we don't know what is at position 1? 

So ""angst"" seems valid? 

But are there any other constraints? 

We can also try ""sandy"", but we rejected because N is at position 3? In ""sandy"": 
Position1: S?
Position2: A?
Position3: N?
Position4: D?
Position5: Y? 

We must avoid placing A at position 3? Which we are? So that's okay? 
But N is at position 3? And we don't know? 

But we also note that position 4 must not be N? Which we know? And ""sandy"" doesn't have N at 4? So safe? 

But we also know that position 4 in the secret word? We don't know? So we will get feedback? 

The problem: if we put N at position 3? Then if the secret word has N at position 3? We get ✓? Otherwise, we get '-'? And it tells us that N is at another position? 

Similarly, A at position 2? 

Now, compare between ""angst"" and ""sandy""? 

In ""angst"", we test position 1 for A? If it is not A? We get '-'? But we know A is in the word? So then we know A must be at 2,4,5? But we didn't test those? 

In ""sandy"", we test A at position 2? 

Another option: ""mind at""? But we need a single word? 

Perhaps ""hands""? But H,A,N,D,S? 
- Letter H? And avoids C,R,E? 
- A at position 2? 
- N at position 3? 

But note: ""hands"" has two of the same? No? Distinct? 
But position: A at 2? N at 3? 

Also, we have a new letter H? So that's good? 

But ""hands"" includes S? Which is common? 

Wait, we are going for breadth? To cover more letters? 

But note: ""angst"" has S,T,G? ""hands"" has D,S,H? 

Perhaps a word with more common consonants? 

How about ""talon""? But O? And L? 
But T and L? Also, ""talon"" has O? 
We can do? But ""talon"" is T,A,L,O,N? 
Which has A at position 2? And N at position 5? 
And avoids C,R,E? 
Also, T and L are commonly used? 

But note the feedback: we got A and N in the word, and we are using two new vowels: O? But vowels are important? And we have used A already? 

But we haven't tested vowels? E is not in the word? But we don't know about I and O? 

So ""talon"" might be good? 

But I think we need to pick one? 

Alternatively, ""plant""? But then R is in ""plant""? No: P,L,A,N,T? 
Actually, ""plant"" has L,A,N,P,T? 
- Without R? Oh: ""plant"" is P,L,A,N,T? 
Wait: P,L,A,N,T? 
That has no R? So it's okay? 
But we must avoid? 
- A at position 3? Bad? 

Let me spell: 
plant: P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) => A at position 3? We cannot have that? 

But if we use ""plant"", we are putting A at position 3? Which we know is wrong? 

Therefore, we must choose a word where A is not at position 3? 

So after reconsidering? We need A at 1,2,4,5? 

So back to ""angst"": A at position 1? 
Or ""sandy"": A at position 2? 
Or ""handy"": H,A,N,D,Y? Then: 
- H(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> A at 2? N at 3? 
And avoids position 3? We didn't put A at 3? So that is okay? 

Also, ""handy"" has no C,R,E? 

Alternatively, ""tango"": T,A,N,G,O? 
- T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) 

A at position 2? N at position 3? 

But wait: position 4 is N in previous? But now we have N at position 3? 

Any of these? 

I think ""sandy"" is acceptable? Or ""tangy""? Same? 

Let me choose ""tangy"": 
T,A,N,G,Y? 
Positions: T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5)

And the word is valid? Yes? 

But to be systematic, we want to test as many as possible not yet tried letters? 

Since we know C,R,E and E are missing? There are many letters left? S,T,L, etc. 

So ""tangy"" uses T,A,N,G,Y? So new letters: T,G,Y? 

We haven't tried T,G,Y before? 

Similarly, ""sandy"" uses S,A,N,D,Y? New letters: S,D,Y? 

Both are good? 

I don't have a strong preference? 

Another common start: when we have A and N, how about ""snail""? But A would be at position 3? Which is not allowed? 

So we choose ""handy"" to include H? 

But let's pick ""sandy"": 

We guessed ""crane"" first? Then ""sandy"" second? 

Let's decide: 
<guess>sandy</guess> 

But note: we are allowed only common words? And ""sandy"" is common? 

Yes? 

So I'll go with that? 

Therefore, second guess: sandy
</think>
After the first guess ""crane"" with feedback:
- C (x): C is not in the secret word.
- R (x): R is not in the secret word.
- A (-): A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N (-): N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E (x): E is not in the secret word.

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains A and N, but not C, R, or E.
- A must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (it cannot be in position 3).
- N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (it cannot be in position 4).
- The new guess must include A and N while avoiding C, R, E.

I selected ""sandy"" as the next guess because:
- It includes A (position 2) and N (position 3), both in new positions not previously tested for these letters.
- It introduces S, D, and Y, which are common letters not yet ruled out.
- The word adheres to the constraints: A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and it avoids C, R, E.
- This guess maximizes feedback potential by testing new positions for known letters and adding three new letters.

<guess>sandy</guess>",sandy,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
This means:
- C is not in the secret word at all.
- R is not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 3).
- N is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 4).
- E is not in the secret word at all.

Important: The positions matter. In ""crane"":
  Position 1: C -> not in word
  Position 2: R -> not in word
  Position 3: A -> present but wrong position
  Position 4: N -> present but wrong position
  Position 5: E -> not in word

Therefore, the secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively. Also, it does not contain C, R, or E.

We must use this information to make a new guess. The new word must:
1. Be a 5-letter English word.
2. Include the letter A and N (since they are in the word), but not in positions 3 and 4?
   - Actually, A cannot be at position 3 and N cannot be at position 4? Not exactly: The feedback says A is present but not at position 3, which doesn't prevent it from being elsewhere. Similarly for N, it is present but not at position 4, so it must be in one of the other positions (1,2,3,5) but note we have constraints from the previous guess.

Wait, let's clarify: the secret word must have A somewhere, but not at position 3? Actually, the feedback tells us that in our guess, the A that we put at position 3 is actually in the word, but not at that position. So in the secret word, A is at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, N is at position 1,2,3, or 5 (but not 4).

Additionally, the word must not contain C, R, or E.

Now, we can think of common words that include A and N.

We also note that in the first guess, A was guessed at position 3 and N at position 4, but they are elsewhere. So let's try to place A and N in different positions.

Also, we want to test new letters because we have information about A and N. We might want to use other common letters to gain more information.

Common letters besides vowels: S, T, L, etc.

But note: we have used C, R, A, N, E. So avoid those except A and N.

So new letters to try: perhaps S, T, L, I, O, D, etc.

Let me try to come up with a word that has:
- A in position other than 3? Actually, we don't know where A is, so we can put it in any position except 3? Wait no: we know A is in the word, but not at position 3. So we can put A at a position we haven't tried (like 1,2,4,5) to test.

Similarly for N, we can put it at a position other than 4.

But note: we don't want to put both A and N in positions we already know they are not? Actually, we only know they are not in the positions we placed them in the first guess. But since we haven't tried other positions, we can try them.

I think a good strategy would be to place A and N in new positions and include other common letters.

Let us consider placing A in position 1 and N in position 2? Or maybe spread out.

Alternatively, we can pick a word with A and N and avoid C,R,E and also avoid positions that we already know are wrong? Actually, we don't have direct information about other positions.

But note: we know that position 1 cannot be A? Because if A were at position 1, then in the first guess we didn't have A at position 1, but that doesn't prevent the secret word from having A at position 1. Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about position 1 because we guessed C there. We only know that C is not in the word and not at position 1.

Similarly, we know that position 2 must not have R? But R is not in the word at all.

Actually, we have:
- The secret word does not have R at all, so position 2 must be another letter.

So let me summarize:
- The word contains A and N, but not C, R, E.
- The positions: 
   - Position 1: cannot be C (and not A? no, because we haven't tested A at position 1) -> actually, we don't know. We only know that C is not there and the letter is not C.
   - Similarly, position 2: cannot be R, and the letter is not R.
   - Position 3: cannot be A? Actually, the feedback says A is present but not at position 3? That is correct: so A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, position 4: N is in the word but not at position 4? And position 5 is not E.

So we must avoid having A at position 3 and N at position 4? Actually, in our next guess we can avoid placing A at position 3 and N at position 4? But we don't know whether they might be elsewhere. Actually, if we put A at position 3 again, then if it's not correct we'll get '-' again? Or if it is the correct position we get a ✓. But we know A is not at position 3 from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for position 3 was A(-) meaning A is in the word but not in this position. Therefore, A cannot be at position 3? Yes, that's fixed: the secret word does not have A at position 3. Similarly, it does not have N at position 4.

Therefore, in our next guess we must avoid:
- Putting A at position 3? Actually, we can put it anywhere we want to test. But we already know that position 3 is wrong for A? Yes. So we don't want to put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. Similarly for N at position 4.

So the new guess should have A in one of the positions: 1,2,4,5 and N in one of the positions:1,2,3,5.

Moreover, we don't want to reuse the letters that are definitely absent: C,R,E.

Therefore, letters we can use: any letter except C,R,E. And we must include A and N.

Now, we have to choose three more letters. We can choose common letters we haven't tried: such as S, T, L, I, O, D, M, B, etc.

Let me try to construct a word:
Options:
- We can try A at the start? Like ""A"" followed by ...
- Or N at the end? 

But we have to have both A and N.

Common words: how about ""sandy""? 
- Has S, A, N, D, Y. 
- A at position 2 -> which is allowed (not position 3)
- N at position 3 -> allowed (because we don't know about position 3 for N? Actually, N can be at position 3? Yes, because previously it was at position 4 and not there, but position 3 hasn't been tested for N? Actually, we placed N at position 4 and got '-' meaning N is in the word but not at 4. So N could be at position 3? Yes.

But let's check if ""sandy"" meets the constraints:
- Includes A and N? Yes.
- A at position 2? That's okay because we know A isn't at position 3? And we don't know about position 2? So we can test it.
- N at position 4? Wait no: in ""sandy"":
  S (position1), A (position2), N (position3), D (position4), Y (position5)
So N is at position 3? Which is unconfirmed.

But we are going to get feedback: if N is at position 3, we get ✓. Otherwise, if N is in the word but not at 3, we get '-', and then we know N must be elsewhere (position 1,2,5).

But note: we also have to avoid C,R,E? Sandy has none of those. So that's okay.

Alternatively, we can try ""bland"", but then B and L are new. Also: A at position 3? Wait, we cannot place A at position 3? Because we already know A is not at position 3? So we must avoid position 3 for A? Yes, because we got '-' meaning it's not there. So if we put A at position 3 again, it would be incorrect? So we shouldn't do that.

Therefore, ""bland"" would have A at position 3: which we know is not possible? Wait no: the secret word does not have A at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 in our guess, we would get '-' again? And that would be redundant? It wouldn't break the game, but it's inefficient because we already know A is not at position 3.

To avoid redundant information, we should not put A at position 3 and N at position 4. So we want to place A and N in new positions.

In ""sandy"":
- A is at position 2? That's new? Previously A was at position 3? So now we test position 2? That's good.
- N is at position 3? Previously N was at position 4? So now testing position 3? That's good? Yes, because we haven't tried N at position 3.

Or is it? Actually, in the first guess we didn't have any letter at position 1,2,5? So we don't know about A or N at those positions? But in ""sandy"", we have:
Position1: S? We don't know.
Position2: A? We don't know? But we know A is in the word? So if it isn't at position 2? Then we get '-' for A? And then we know it must be at 1,4,5? 

That's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't place A and N adjacent? Or try to cover more common letters.

Another option: ""piano""? But that has P,I,A,N,O. And note: O is a vowel? But we haven't tried O? And E is missing? But we don't care? We are avoiding E? But note: words can have repeated letters? We are not sure? But we don't know? So let's assume no repeated letters? Unless we have evidence? 

The game can have repeated letters? Actually, the rules don't say? But in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? So we cannot assume? But for now, we don't have any information? And ""piano"" has distinct letters? So that's good? Also, ""piano"" has A at position 3? Oh wait, we cannot put A at position 3? Because we know A isn't at position 3? So if we put ""piano"", then A would be at position 3? Which we know is wrong? So we shouldn't do that? Because we would get a '-' and we know that already? So it doesn't give new information? 

Therefore, avoid position 3 for A? So ""piano"" is bad.

How about ""adorn""? 
- A at position 1? New position? 
- D,O,R,N? Wait: R is not allowed? Because feedback said R is not in the word? So ""adorn"" contains R? Which is bad? We cannot use R? 

Another word: ""train""? But has R? And T,R,A,I,N? R again? Not allowed? 

We need words without R and without C and E? 

How about ""saint""? 
- S,A,I,N,T? 
- A at position 2? Which is okay? 
- N at position 4? Wait: we know from the first guess that N is not at position 4? So if we put N at position 4? We would get a '-'? Meaning that if the secret word has N elsewhere? So we will learn that N isn't at position 4? But we already know that? So redundant? 

We should avoid putting N at position 4? Because we know it's not there? 

Therefore, in our next guess we must avoid:
- Position 3 for A? Because we know A isn't at position 3? So in the new word, A should be at 1,2,4, or 5? 
- Position 4 for N? So N should be at 1,2,3, or 5? 

Therefore, ""saint"" is bad? Because it has N at position 4? 

How about ""stain""? 
- S,T,A,I,N? 
- A at position 3? Oh again? We cannot put A at position 3? 

Wait, let me write:
stain: s (1), t (2), a (3), i (4), n (5)? 
So A at position 3? Which is what we must avoid? 

How about ""stank""? 
- S,T,A,N,K? 
- A at position 3? Still bad? 

We want words where A is not at position 3? 

How about ""snail""? 
- S at 1, N at 2? That's allowed for N? We don't know about N at position 2? 
- A at position 3? Again? Bad? 

We might shift? How about ""lacks""? But then C is in it? We know C is not in the word? So ""lacks"" uses C? Forbidden? 

Let me think: A at position 1? Like ""ankle""? But E at the end? We know E is not in the word? So not allowed? 

How about ""aloud""? 
- A,L,O,U,D? 
- Does not include N? We must include N? Because the feedback says N is in the word? 

We must include both A and N? Because the feedback indicates they are in the word? 

So the word must contain A and N? 

Therefore, ""aloud"" is missing N? So invalid? 

How about ""brand""? But has R? And B,R,A,N,D? R is forbidden? 

We need words without C,R,E and with A and N? 

And positioning: 
We want to test A in a new position? Maybe position 1? 

For example, ""angel""? But E is there? And G,L? But E is forbidden? 

""angst""? 
- A,N,G,S,T? 
- A at position 1? That's good? 
- N at position 2? Which is new? 
But note: does it have any forbidden letters? Forbidden: C,R,E? None? So ""angst"" is A, N, G, S, T? And we can use it? 

But what about positions? 
- A at 1: we think it might be? 
- N at 2: we don't know? 

But note: we also must consider that in the first guess, position 4 had an N? And we said it wasn't there? So we are avoiding position 4? In this case, N is at position 2? So that's okay? 

Also, A at position 1? Previously, we had a letter at position 1? It was C? Which is not in the word? So we don't know what is at position 1? 

So ""angst"" seems valid? 

But are there any other constraints? 

We can also try ""sandy"", but we rejected because N is at position 3? In ""sandy"": 
Position1: S?
Position2: A?
Position3: N?
Position4: D?
Position5: Y? 

We must avoid placing A at position 3? Which we are? So that's okay? 
But N is at position 3? And we don't know? 

But we also note that position 4 must not be N? Which we know? And ""sandy"" doesn't have N at 4? So safe? 

But we also know that position 4 in the secret word? We don't know? So we will get feedback? 

The problem: if we put N at position 3? Then if the secret word has N at position 3? We get ✓? Otherwise, we get '-'? And it tells us that N is at another position? 

Similarly, A at position 2? 

Now, compare between ""angst"" and ""sandy""? 

In ""angst"", we test position 1 for A? If it is not A? We get '-'? But we know A is in the word? So then we know A must be at 2,4,5? But we didn't test those? 

In ""sandy"", we test A at position 2? 

Another option: ""mind at""? But we need a single word? 

Perhaps ""hands""? But H,A,N,D,S? 
- Letter H? And avoids C,R,E? 
- A at position 2? 
- N at position 3? 

But note: ""hands"" has two of the same? No? Distinct? 
But position: A at 2? N at 3? 

Also, we have a new letter H? So that's good? 

But ""hands"" includes S? Which is common? 

Wait, we are going for breadth? To cover more letters? 

But note: ""angst"" has S,T,G? ""hands"" has D,S,H? 

Perhaps a word with more common consonants? 

How about ""talon""? But O? And L? 
But T and L? Also, ""talon"" has O? 
We can do? But ""talon"" is T,A,L,O,N? 
Which has A at position 2? And N at position 5? 
And avoids C,R,E? 
Also, T and L are commonly used? 

But note the feedback: we got A and N in the word, and we are using two new vowels: O? But vowels are important? And we have used A already? 

But we haven't tested vowels? E is not in the word? But we don't know about I and O? 

So ""talon"" might be good? 

But I think we need to pick one? 

Alternatively, ""plant""? But then R is in ""plant""? No: P,L,A,N,T? 
Actually, ""plant"" has L,A,N,P,T? 
- Without R? Oh: ""plant"" is P,L,A,N,T? 
Wait: P,L,A,N,T? 
That has no R? So it's okay? 
But we must avoid? 
- A at position 3? Bad? 

Let me spell: 
plant: P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) => A at position 3? We cannot have that? 

But if we use ""plant"", we are putting A at position 3? Which we know is wrong? 

Therefore, we must choose a word where A is not at position 3? 

So after reconsidering? We need A at 1,2,4,5? 

So back to ""angst"": A at position 1? 
Or ""sandy"": A at position 2? 
Or ""handy"": H,A,N,D,Y? Then: 
- H(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> A at 2? N at 3? 
And avoids position 3? We didn't put A at 3? So that is okay? 

Also, ""handy"" has no C,R,E? 

Alternatively, ""tango"": T,A,N,G,O? 
- T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) 

A at position 2? N at position 3? 

But wait: position 4 is N in previous? But now we have N at position 3? 

Any of these? 

I think ""sandy"" is acceptable? Or ""tangy""? Same? 

Let me choose ""tangy"": 
T,A,N,G,Y? 
Positions: T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5)

And the word is valid? Yes? 

But to be systematic, we want to test as many as possible not yet tried letters? 

Since we know C,R,E and E are missing? There are many letters left? S,T,L, etc. 

So ""tangy"" uses T,A,N,G,Y? So new letters: T,G,Y? 

We haven't tried T,G,Y before? 

Similarly, ""sandy"" uses S,A,N,D,Y? New letters: S,D,Y? 

Both are good? 

I don't have a strong preference? 

Another common start: when we have A and N, how about ""snail""? But A would be at position 3? Which is not allowed? 

So we choose ""handy"" to include H? 

But let's pick ""sandy"": 

We guessed ""crane"" first? Then ""sandy"" second? 

Let's decide: 
<guess>sandy</guess> 

But note: we are allowed only common words? And ""sandy"" is common? 

Yes? 

So I'll go with that? 

Therefore, second guess: sandyAfter the first guess ""crane"" with feedback:
- C (x): C is not in the secret word.
- R (x): R is not in the secret word.
- A (-): A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N (-): N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E (x): E is not in the secret word.

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains A and N, but not C, R, or E.
- A must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (it cannot be in position 3).
- N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (it cannot be in position 4).
- The new guess must include A and N while avoiding C, R, E.

I selected ""sandy"" as the next guess because:
- It includes A (position 2) and N (position 3), both in new positions not previously tested for these letters.
- It introduces S, D, and Y, which are common letters not yet ruled out.
- The word adheres to the constraints: A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and it avoids C, R, E.
- This guess maximizes feedback potential by testing new positions for known letters and adding three new letters.",Guess 2: sandy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) N(✓) D(-) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,GONAD,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

 So, our first guess will be: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
This means:
- C is not in the secret word at all.
- R is not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 3).
- N is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 4).
- E is not in the secret word at all.

Important: The positions matter. In ""crane"":
  Position 1: C -> not in word
  Position 2: R -> not in word
  Position 3: A -> present but wrong position
  Position 4: N -> present but wrong position
  Position 5: E -> not in word

Therefore, the secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively. Also, it does not contain C, R, or E.

We must use this information to make a new guess. The new word must:
1. Be a 5-letter English word.
2. Include the letter A and N (since they are in the word), but not in positions 3 and 4?
   - Actually, A cannot be at position 3 and N cannot be at position 4? Not exactly: The feedback says A is present but not at position 3, which doesn't prevent it from being elsewhere. Similarly for N, it is present but not at position 4, so it must be in one of the other positions (1,2,3,5) but note we have constraints from the previous guess.

Wait, let's clarify: the secret word must have A somewhere, but not at position 3? Actually, the feedback tells us that in our guess, the A that we put at position 3 is actually in the word, but not at that position. So in the secret word, A is at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, N is at position 1,2,3, or 5 (but not 4).

Additionally, the word must not contain C, R, or E.

Now, we can think of common words that include A and N.

We also note that in the first guess, A was guessed at position 3 and N at position 4, but they are elsewhere. So let's try to place A and N in different positions.

Also, we want to test new letters because we have information about A and N. We might want to use other common letters to gain more information.

Common letters besides vowels: S, T, L, etc.

But note: we have used C, R, A, N, E. So avoid those except A and N.

So new letters to try: perhaps S, T, L, I, O, D, etc.

Let me try to come up with a word that has:
- A in position other than 3? Actually, we don't know where A is, so we can put it in any position except 3? Wait no: we know A is in the word, but not at position 3. So we can put A at a position we haven't tried (like 1,2,4,5) to test.

Similarly for N, we can put it at a position other than 4.

But note: we don't want to put both A and N in positions we already know they are not? Actually, we only know they are not in the positions we placed them in the first guess. But since we haven't tried other positions, we can try them.

I think a good strategy would be to place A and N in new positions and include other common letters.

Let us consider placing A in position 1 and N in position 2? Or maybe spread out.

Alternatively, we can pick a word with A and N and avoid C,R,E and also avoid positions that we already know are wrong? Actually, we don't have direct information about other positions.

But note: we know that position 1 cannot be A? Because if A were at position 1, then in the first guess we didn't have A at position 1, but that doesn't prevent the secret word from having A at position 1. Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about position 1 because we guessed C there. We only know that C is not in the word and not at position 1.

Similarly, we know that position 2 must not have R? But R is not in the word at all.

Actually, we have:
- The secret word does not have R at all, so position 2 must be another letter.

So let me summarize:
- The word contains A and N, but not C, R, E.
- The positions: 
   - Position 1: cannot be C (and not A? no, because we haven't tested A at position 1) -> actually, we don't know. We only know that C is not there and the letter is not C.
   - Similarly, position 2: cannot be R, and the letter is not R.
   - Position 3: cannot be A? Actually, the feedback says A is present but not at position 3? That is correct: so A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, position 4: N is in the word but not at position 4? And position 5 is not E.

So we must avoid having A at position 3 and N at position 4? Actually, in our next guess we can avoid placing A at position 3 and N at position 4? But we don't know whether they might be elsewhere. Actually, if we put A at position 3 again, then if it's not correct we'll get '-' again? Or if it is the correct position we get a ✓. But we know A is not at position 3 from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for position 3 was A(-) meaning A is in the word but not in this position. Therefore, A cannot be at position 3? Yes, that's fixed: the secret word does not have A at position 3. Similarly, it does not have N at position 4.

Therefore, in our next guess we must avoid:
- Putting A at position 3? Actually, we can put it anywhere we want to test. But we already know that position 3 is wrong for A? Yes. So we don't want to put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. Similarly for N at position 4.

So the new guess should have A in one of the positions: 1,2,4,5 and N in one of the positions:1,2,3,5.

Moreover, we don't want to reuse the letters that are definitely absent: C,R,E.

Therefore, letters we can use: any letter except C,R,E. And we must include A and N.

Now, we have to choose three more letters. We can choose common letters we haven't tried: such as S, T, L, I, O, D, M, B, etc.

Let me try to construct a word:
Options:
- We can try A at the start? Like ""A"" followed by ...
- Or N at the end? 

But we have to have both A and N.

Common words: how about ""sandy""? 
- Has S, A, N, D, Y. 
- A at position 2 -> which is allowed (not position 3)
- N at position 3 -> allowed (because we don't know about position 3 for N? Actually, N can be at position 3? Yes, because previously it was at position 4 and not there, but position 3 hasn't been tested for N? Actually, we placed N at position 4 and got '-' meaning N is in the word but not at 4. So N could be at position 3? Yes.

But let's check if ""sandy"" meets the constraints:
- Includes A and N? Yes.
- A at position 2? That's okay because we know A isn't at position 3? And we don't know about position 2? So we can test it.
- N at position 4? Wait no: in ""sandy"":
  S (position1), A (position2), N (position3), D (position4), Y (position5)
So N is at position 3? Which is unconfirmed.

But we are going to get feedback: if N is at position 3, we get ✓. Otherwise, if N is in the word but not at 3, we get '-', and then we know N must be elsewhere (position 1,2,5).

But note: we also have to avoid C,R,E? Sandy has none of those. So that's okay.

Alternatively, we can try ""bland"", but then B and L are new. Also: A at position 3? Wait, we cannot place A at position 3? Because we already know A is not at position 3? So we must avoid position 3 for A? Yes, because we got '-' meaning it's not there. So if we put A at position 3 again, it would be incorrect? So we shouldn't do that.

Therefore, ""bland"" would have A at position 3: which we know is not possible? Wait no: the secret word does not have A at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 in our guess, we would get '-' again? And that would be redundant? It wouldn't break the game, but it's inefficient because we already know A is not at position 3.

To avoid redundant information, we should not put A at position 3 and N at position 4. So we want to place A and N in new positions.

In ""sandy"":
- A is at position 2? That's new? Previously A was at position 3? So now we test position 2? That's good.
- N is at position 3? Previously N was at position 4? So now testing position 3? That's good? Yes, because we haven't tried N at position 3.

Or is it? Actually, in the first guess we didn't have any letter at position 1,2,5? So we don't know about A or N at those positions? But in ""sandy"", we have:
Position1: S? We don't know.
Position2: A? We don't know? But we know A is in the word? So if it isn't at position 2? Then we get '-' for A? And then we know it must be at 1,4,5? 

That's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't place A and N adjacent? Or try to cover more common letters.

Another option: ""piano""? But that has P,I,A,N,O. And note: O is a vowel? But we haven't tried O? And E is missing? But we don't care? We are avoiding E? But note: words can have repeated letters? We are not sure? But we don't know? So let's assume no repeated letters? Unless we have evidence? 

The game can have repeated letters? Actually, the rules don't say? But in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? So we cannot assume? But for now, we don't have any information? And ""piano"" has distinct letters? So that's good? Also, ""piano"" has A at position 3? Oh wait, we cannot put A at position 3? Because we know A isn't at position 3? So if we put ""piano"", then A would be at position 3? Which we know is wrong? So we shouldn't do that? Because we would get a '-' and we know that already? So it doesn't give new information? 

Therefore, avoid position 3 for A? So ""piano"" is bad.

How about ""adorn""? 
- A at position 1? New position? 
- D,O,R,N? Wait: R is not allowed? Because feedback said R is not in the word? So ""adorn"" contains R? Which is bad? We cannot use R? 

Another word: ""train""? But has R? And T,R,A,I,N? R again? Not allowed? 

We need words without R and without C and E? 

How about ""saint""? 
- S,A,I,N,T? 
- A at position 2? Which is okay? 
- N at position 4? Wait: we know from the first guess that N is not at position 4? So if we put N at position 4? We would get a '-'? Meaning that if the secret word has N elsewhere? So we will learn that N isn't at position 4? But we already know that? So redundant? 

We should avoid putting N at position 4? Because we know it's not there? 

Therefore, in our next guess we must avoid:
- Position 3 for A? Because we know A isn't at position 3? So in the new word, A should be at 1,2,4, or 5? 
- Position 4 for N? So N should be at 1,2,3, or 5? 

Therefore, ""saint"" is bad? Because it has N at position 4? 

How about ""stain""? 
- S,T,A,I,N? 
- A at position 3? Oh again? We cannot put A at position 3? 

Wait, let me write:
stain: s (1), t (2), a (3), i (4), n (5)? 
So A at position 3? Which is what we must avoid? 

How about ""stank""? 
- S,T,A,N,K? 
- A at position 3? Still bad? 

We want words where A is not at position 3? 

How about ""snail""? 
- S at 1, N at 2? That's allowed for N? We don't know about N at position 2? 
- A at position 3? Again? Bad? 

We might shift? How about ""lacks""? But then C is in it? We know C is not in the word? So ""lacks"" uses C? Forbidden? 

Let me think: A at position 1? Like ""ankle""? But E at the end? We know E is not in the word? So not allowed? 

How about ""aloud""? 
- A,L,O,U,D? 
- Does not include N? We must include N? Because the feedback says N is in the word? 

We must include both A and N? Because the feedback indicates they are in the word? 

So the word must contain A and N? 

Therefore, ""aloud"" is missing N? So invalid? 

How about ""brand""? But has R? And B,R,A,N,D? R is forbidden? 

We need words without C,R,E and with A and N? 

And positioning: 
We want to test A in a new position? Maybe position 1? 

For example, ""angel""? But E is there? And G,L? But E is forbidden? 

""angst""? 
- A,N,G,S,T? 
- A at position 1? That's good? 
- N at position 2? Which is new? 
But note: does it have any forbidden letters? Forbidden: C,R,E? None? So ""angst"" is A, N, G, S, T? And we can use it? 

But what about positions? 
- A at 1: we think it might be? 
- N at 2: we don't know? 

But note: we also must consider that in the first guess, position 4 had an N? And we said it wasn't there? So we are avoiding position 4? In this case, N is at position 2? So that's okay? 

Also, A at position 1? Previously, we had a letter at position 1? It was C? Which is not in the word? So we don't know what is at position 1? 

So ""angst"" seems valid? 

But are there any other constraints? 

We can also try ""sandy"", but we rejected because N is at position 3? In ""sandy"": 
Position1: S?
Position2: A?
Position3: N?
Position4: D?
Position5: Y? 

We must avoid placing A at position 3? Which we are? So that's okay? 
But N is at position 3? And we don't know? 

But we also note that position 4 must not be N? Which we know? And ""sandy"" doesn't have N at 4? So safe? 

But we also know that position 4 in the secret word? We don't know? So we will get feedback? 

The problem: if we put N at position 3? Then if the secret word has N at position 3? We get ✓? Otherwise, we get '-'? And it tells us that N is at another position? 

Similarly, A at position 2? 

Now, compare between ""angst"" and ""sandy""? 

In ""angst"", we test position 1 for A? If it is not A? We get '-'? But we know A is in the word? So then we know A must be at 2,4,5? But we didn't test those? 

In ""sandy"", we test A at position 2? 

Another option: ""mind at""? But we need a single word? 

Perhaps ""hands""? But H,A,N,D,S? 
- Letter H? And avoids C,R,E? 
- A at position 2? 
- N at position 3? 

But note: ""hands"" has two of the same? No? Distinct? 
But position: A at 2? N at 3? 

Also, we have a new letter H? So that's good? 

But ""hands"" includes S? Which is common? 

Wait, we are going for breadth? To cover more letters? 

But note: ""angst"" has S,T,G? ""hands"" has D,S,H? 

Perhaps a word with more common consonants? 

How about ""talon""? But O? And L? 
But T and L? Also, ""talon"" has O? 
We can do? But ""talon"" is T,A,L,O,N? 
Which has A at position 2? And N at position 5? 
And avoids C,R,E? 
Also, T and L are commonly used? 

But note the feedback: we got A and N in the word, and we are using two new vowels: O? But vowels are important? And we have used A already? 

But we haven't tested vowels? E is not in the word? But we don't know about I and O? 

So ""talon"" might be good? 

But I think we need to pick one? 

Alternatively, ""plant""? But then R is in ""plant""? No: P,L,A,N,T? 
Actually, ""plant"" has L,A,N,P,T? 
- Without R? Oh: ""plant"" is P,L,A,N,T? 
Wait: P,L,A,N,T? 
That has no R? So it's okay? 
But we must avoid? 
- A at position 3? Bad? 

Let me spell: 
plant: P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) => A at position 3? We cannot have that? 

But if we use ""plant"", we are putting A at position 3? Which we know is wrong? 

Therefore, we must choose a word where A is not at position 3? 

So after reconsidering? We need A at 1,2,4,5? 

So back to ""angst"": A at position 1? 
Or ""sandy"": A at position 2? 
Or ""handy"": H,A,N,D,Y? Then: 
- H(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> A at 2? N at 3? 
And avoids position 3? We didn't put A at 3? So that is okay? 

Also, ""handy"" has no C,R,E? 

Alternatively, ""tango"": T,A,N,G,O? 
- T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) 

A at position 2? N at position 3? 

But wait: position 4 is N in previous? But now we have N at position 3? 

Any of these? 

I think ""sandy"" is acceptable? Or ""tangy""? Same? 

Let me choose ""tangy"": 
T,A,N,G,Y? 
Positions: T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5)

And the word is valid? Yes? 

But to be systematic, we want to test as many as possible not yet tried letters? 

Since we know C,R,E and E are missing? There are many letters left? S,T,L, etc. 

So ""tangy"" uses T,A,N,G,Y? So new letters: T,G,Y? 

We haven't tried T,G,Y before? 

Similarly, ""sandy"" uses S,A,N,D,Y? New letters: S,D,Y? 

Both are good? 

I don't have a strong preference? 

Another common start: when we have A and N, how about ""snail""? But A would be at position 3? Which is not allowed? 

So we choose ""handy"" to include H? 

But let's pick ""sandy"": 

We guessed ""crane"" first? Then ""sandy"" second? 

Let's decide: 
<guess>sandy</guess> 

But note: we are allowed only common words? And ""sandy"" is common? 

Yes? 

So I'll go with that? 

Therefore, second guess: sandyAfter the first guess ""crane"" with feedback:
- C (x): C is not in the secret word.
- R (x): R is not in the secret word.
- A (-): A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N (-): N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E (x): E is not in the secret word.

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains A and N, but not C, R, or E.
- A must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (it cannot be in position 3).
- N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (it cannot be in position 4).
- The new guess must include A and N while avoiding C, R, E.

I selected ""sandy"" as the next guess because:
- It includes A (position 2) and N (position 3), both in new positions not previously tested for these letters.
- It introduces S, D, and Y, which are common letters not yet ruled out.
- The word adheres to the constraints: A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and it avoids C, R, E.
- This guess maximizes feedback potential by testing new positions for known letters and adding three new letters.

In ""crane"":\n  Position 1: C -> not in word\n  Position 2: R -> not in word\n  Position 3: A -> present but wrong position\n  Position 4: N -> present but wrong position\n  Position 5: E -> not in word\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively. Also, it does not contain C, R, or E.\n\nWe must use this information to make a new guess. The new word must:\n1. Be a 5-letter English word.\n2. Include the letter A and N (since they are in the word), but not in positions 3 and 4?\n   - Actually, A cannot be at position 3 and N cannot be at position 4? Not exactly: The feedback says A is present but not at position 3, which doesn\'t prevent it from being elsewhere. Similarly for N, it is present but not at position 4, so it must be in one of the other positions (1,2,3,5) but note we have constraints from the previous guess.\n\nWait, let\'s clarify: the secret word must have A somewhere, but not at position 3? Actually, the feedback tells us that in our guess, the A that we put at position 3 is actually in the word, but not at that position. So in the secret word, A is at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, N is at position 1,2,3, or 5 (but not 4).\n\nAdditionally, the word must not contain C, R, or E.\n\nNow, we can think of common words that include A and N.\n\nWe also note that in the first guess, A was guessed at position 3 and N at position 4, but they are elsewhere. So let\'s try to place A and N in different positions.\n\nAlso, we want to test new letters because we have information about A and N. We might want to use other common letters to gain more information.\n\nCommon letters besides vowels: S, T, L, etc.\n\nBut note: we have used C, R, A, N, E. So avoid those except A and N.\n\nSo new letters to try: perhaps S, T, L, I, O, D, etc.\n\nLet me try to come up with a word that has:\n- A in position other than 3? Actually, we don\'t know where A is, so we can put it in any position except 3? Wait no: we know A is in the word, but not at position 3. So we can put A at a position we haven\'t tried (like 1,2,4,5) to test.\n\nSimilarly for N, we can put it at a position other than 4.\n\nBut note: we don\'t want to put both A and N in positions we already know they are not? Actually, we only know they are not in the positions we placed them in the first guess. But since we haven\'t tried other positions, we can try them.\n\nI think a good strategy would be to place A and N in new positions and include other common letters.\n\nLet us consider placing A in position 1 and N in position 2? Or maybe spread out.\n\nAlternatively, we can pick a word with A and N and avoid C,R,E and also avoid positions that we already know are wrong? Actually, we don\'t have direct information about other positions.\n\nBut note: we know that position 1 cannot be A? Because if A were at position 1, then in the first guess we didn\'t have A at position 1, but that doesn\'t prevent the secret word from having A at position 1. Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about position 1 because we guessed C there. We only know that C is not in the word and not at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, we know that position 2 must not have R? But R is not in the word at all.\n\nActually, we have:\n- The secret word does not have R at all, so position 2 must be another letter.\n\nSo let me summarize:\n- The word contains A and N, but not C, R, E.\n- The positions: \n   - Position 1: cannot be C (and not A? no, because we haven\'t tested A at position 1) -> actually, we don\'t know. We only know that C is not there and the letter is not C.\n   - Similarly, position 2: cannot be R, and the letter is not R.\n   - Position 3: cannot be A? Actually, the feedback says A is present but not at position 3? That is correct: so A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, position 4: N is in the word but not at position 4? And position 5 is not E.\n\nSo we must avoid having A at position 3 and N at position 4? Actually, in our next guess we can avoid placing A at position 3 and N at position 4? But we don\'t know whether they might be elsewhere. Actually, if we put A at position 3 again, then if it\'s not correct we\'ll get \'-\' again? Or if it is the correct position we get a ✓. But we know A is not at position 3 from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for position 3 was A(-) meaning A is in the word but not in this position. Therefore, A cannot be at position 3? Yes, that\'s fixed: the secret word does not have A at position 3. Similarly, it does not have N at position 4.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess we must avoid:\n- Putting A at position 3? Actually, we can put it anywhere we want to test. But we already know that position 3 is wrong for A? Yes. So we don\'t want to put A at position 3 again because we know it\'s not there. Similarly for N at position 4.\n\nSo the new guess should have A in one of the positions: 1,2,4,5 and N in one of the positions:1,2,3,5.\n\nMoreover, we don\'t want to reuse the letters that are definitely absent: C,R,E.\n\nTherefore, letters we can use: any letter except C,R,E. And we must include A and N.\n\nNow, we have to choose three more letters. We can choose common letters we haven\'t tried: such as S, T, L, I, O, D, M, B, etc.\n\nLet me try to construct a word:\nOptions:\n- We can try A at the start? Like ""A"" followed by ...\n- Or N at the end? \n\nBut we have to have both A and N.\n\nCommon words: how about ""sandy""? \n- Has S, A, N, D, Y. \n- A at position 2 -> which is allowed (not position 3)\n- N at position 3 -> allowed (because we don\'t know about position 3 for N? Actually, N can be at position 3? Yes, because previously it was at position 4 and not there, but position 3 hasn\'t been tested for N? Actually, we placed N at position 4 and got \'-\' meaning N is in the word but not at 4. So N could be at position 3? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s check if ""sandy"" meets the constraints:\n- Includes A and N? Yes.\n- A at position 2? That\'s okay because we know A isn\'t at position 3? And we don\'t know about position 2? So we can test it.\n- N at position 4? Wait no: in ""sandy"":\n  S (position1), A (position2), N (position3), D (position4), Y (position5)\nSo N is at position 3? Which is unconfirmed.\n\nBut we are going to get feedback: if N is at position 3, we get ✓. Otherwise, if N is in the word but not at 3, we get \'-\', and then we know N must be elsewhere (position 1,2,5).\n\nBut note: we also have to avoid C,R,E? Sandy has none of those. So that\'s okay.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""bland"", but then B and L are new. Also: A at position 3? Wait, we cannot place A at position 3? Because we already know A is not at position 3? So we must avoid position 3 for A? Yes, because we got \'-\' meaning it\'s not there. So if we put A at position 3 again, it would be incorrect? So we shouldn\'t do that.\n\nTherefore, ""bland"" would have A at position 3: which we know is not possible? Wait no: the secret word does not have A at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 in our guess, we would get \'-\' again? And that would be redundant? It wouldn\'t break the game, but it\'s inefficient because we already know A is not at position 3.\n\nTo avoid redundant information, we should not put A at position 3 and N at position 4. So we want to place A and N in new positions.\n\nIn ""sandy"":\n- A is at position 2? That\'s new? Previously A was at position 3? So now we test position 2? That\'s good.\n- N is at position 3? Previously N was at position 4? So now testing position 3? That\'s good? Yes, because we haven\'t tried N at position 3.\n\nOr is it? Actually, in the first guess we didn\'t have any letter at position 1,2,5? So we don\'t know about A or N at those positions? But in ""sandy"", we have:\nPosition1: S? We don\'t know.\nPosition2: A? We don\'t know? But we know A is in the word? So if it isn\'t at position 2? Then we get \'-\' for A? And then we know it must be at 1,4,5? \n\nThat\'s acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t place A and N adjacent? Or try to cover more common letters.\n\nAnother option: ""piano""? But that has P,I,A,N,O. And note: O is a vowel? But we haven\'t tried O? And E is missing? But we don\'t care? We are avoiding E? But note: words can have repeated letters? We are not sure? But we don\'t know? So let\'s assume no repeated letters? Unless we have evidence? \n\nThe game can have repeated letters? Actually, the rules don\'t say? But in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? So we cannot assume? But for now, we don\'t have any information? And ""piano"" has distinct letters? So that\'s good? Also, ""piano"" has A at position 3? Oh wait, we cannot put A at position 3? Because we know A isn\'t at position 3? So if we put ""piano"", then A would be at position 3? Which we know is wrong? So we shouldn\'t do that? Because we would get a \'-\' and we know that already? So it doesn\'t give new information? \n\nTherefore, avoid position 3 for A? So ""piano"" is bad.\n\nHow about ""adorn""? \n- A at position 1? New position? \n- D,O,R,N? Wait: R is not allowed? Because feedback said R is not in the word? So ""adorn"" contains R? Which is bad? We cannot use R? \n\nAnother word: ""train""? But has R? And T,R,A,I,N? R again? Not allowed? \n\nWe need words without R and without C and E? \n\nHow about ""saint""? \n- S,A,I,N,T? \n- A at position 2? Which is okay? \n- N at position 4? Wait: we know from the first guess that N is not at position 4? So if we put N at position 4? We would get a \'-\'? Meaning that if the secret word has N elsewhere? So we will learn that N isn\'t at position 4? But we already know that? So redundant? \n\nWe should avoid putting N at position 4? Because we know it\'s not there? \n\nTherefore, in our next guess we must avoid:\n- Position 3 for A? Because we know A isn\'t at position 3? So in the new word, A should be at 1,2,4, or 5? \n- Position 4 for N? So N should be at 1,2,3, or 5? \n\nTherefore, ""saint"" is bad? Because it has N at position 4? \n\nHow about ""stain""? \n- S,T,A,I,N? \n- A at position 3? Oh again? We cannot put A at position 3? \n\nWait, let me write:\nstain: s (1), t (2), a (3), i (4), n (5)? \nSo A at position 3? Which is what we must avoid? \n\nHow about ""stank""? \n- S,T,A,N,K? \n- A at position 3? Still bad? \n\nWe want words where A is not at position 3? \n\nHow about ""snail""? \n- S at 1, N at 2? That\'s allowed for N? We don\'t know about N at position 2? \n- A at position 3? Again? Bad? \n\nWe might shift? How about ""lacks""? But then C is in it? We know C is not in the word? So ""lacks"" uses C? Forbidden? \n\nLet me think: A at position 1? Like ""ankle""? But E at the end? We know E is not in the word? So not allowed? \n\nHow about ""aloud""? \n- A,L,O,U,D? \n- Does not include N? We must include N? Because the feedback says N is in the word? \n\nWe must include both A and N? Because the feedback indicates they are in the word? \n\nSo the word must contain A and N? \n\nTherefore, ""aloud"" is missing N? So invalid? \n\nHow about ""brand""? But has R? And B,R,A,N,D? R is forbidden? \n\nWe need words without C,R,E and with A and N? \n\nAnd positioning: \nWe want to test A in a new position? Maybe position 1? \n\nFor example, ""angel""? But E is there? And G,L? But E is forbidden? \n\n""angst""? \n- A,N,G,S,T? \n- A at position 1? That\'s good? \n- N at position 2? Which is new? \nBut note: does it have any forbidden letters? Forbidden: C,R,E? None? So ""angst"" is A, N, G, S, T? And we can use it? \n\nBut what about positions? \n- A at 1: we think it might be? \n- N at 2: we don\'t know? \n\nBut note: we also must consider that in the first guess, position 4 had an N? And we said it wasn\'t there? So we are avoiding position 4? In this case, N is at position 2? So that\'s okay? \n\nAlso, A at position 1? Previously, we had a letter at position 1? It was C? Which is not in the word? So we don\'t know what is at position 1? \n\nSo ""angst"" seems valid? \n\nBut are there any other constraints? \n\nWe can also try ""sandy"", but we rejected because N is at position 3? In ""sandy"": \nPosition1: S?\nPosition2: A?\nPosition3: N?\nPosition4: D?\nPosition5: Y? \n\nWe must avoid placing A at position 3? Which we are? So that\'s okay? \nBut N is at position 3? And we don\'t know? \n\nBut we also note that position 4 must not be N? Which we know? And ""sandy"" doesn\'t have N at 4? So safe? \n\nBut we also know that position 4 in the secret word? We don\'t know? So we will get feedback? \n\nThe problem: if we put N at position 3? Then if the secret word has N at position 3? We get ✓? Otherwise, we get \'-\'? And it tells us that N is at another position? \n\nSimilarly, A at position 2? \n\nNow, compare between ""angst"" and ""sandy""? \n\nIn ""angst"", we test position 1 for A? If it is not A? We get \'-\'? But we know A is in the word? So then we know A must be at 2,4,5? But we didn\'t test those? \n\nIn ""sandy"", we test A at position 2? \n\nAnother option: ""mind at""? But we need a single word? \n\nPerhaps ""hands""? But H,A,N,D,S? \n- Letter H? And avoids C,R,E? \n- A at position 2? \n- N at position 3? \n\nBut note: ""hands"" has two of the same? No? Distinct? \nBut position: A at 2? N at 3? \n\nAlso, we have a new letter H? So that\'s good? \n\nBut ""hands"" includes S? Which is common? \n\nWait, we are going for breadth? To cover more letters? \n\nBut note: ""angst"" has S,T,G? ""hands"" has D,S,H? \n\nPerhaps a word with more common consonants? \n\nHow about ""talon""? But O? And L? \nBut T and L? Also, ""talon"" has O? \nWe can do? But ""talon"" is T,A,L,O,N? \nWhich has A at position 2? And N at position 5? \nAnd avoids C,R,E? \nAlso, T and L are commonly used? \n\nBut note the feedback: we got A and N in the word, and we are using two new vowels: O? But vowels are important? And we have used A already? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested vowels? E is not in the word? But we don\'t know about I and O? \n\nSo ""talon"" might be good? \n\nBut I think we need to pick one? \n\nAlternatively, ""plant""? But then R is in ""plant""? No: P,L,A,N,T? \nActually, ""plant"" has L,A,N,P,T? \n- Without R? Oh: ""plant"" is P,L,A,N,T? \nWait: P,L,A,N,T? \nThat has no R? So it\'s okay? \nBut we must avoid? \n- A at position 3? Bad? \n\nLet me spell: \nplant: P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) => A at position 3? We cannot have that? \n\nBut if we use ""plant"", we are putting A at position 3? Which we know is wrong? \n\nTherefore, we must choose a word where A is not at position 3? \n\nSo after reconsidering? We need A at 1,2,4,5? \n\nSo back to ""angst"": A at position 1? \nOr ""sandy"": A at position 2? \nOr ""handy"": H,A,N,D,Y? Then: \n- H(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> A at 2? N at 3? \nAnd avoids position 3? We didn\'t put A at 3? So that is okay? \n\nAlso, ""handy"" has no C,R,E? \n\nAlternatively, ""tango"": T,A,N,G,O? \n- T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) \n\nA at position 2? N at position 3? \n\nBut wait: position 4 is N in previous? But now we have N at position 3? \n\nAny of these? \n\nI think ""sandy"" is acceptable? Or ""tangy""? Same? \n\nLet me choose ""tangy"": \nT,A,N,G,Y? \nPositions: T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5)\n\nAnd the word is valid? Yes? \n\nBut to be systematic, we want to test as many as possible not yet tried letters? \n\nSince we know C,R,E and E are missing? There are many letters left? S,T,L, etc. \n\nSo ""tangy"" uses T,A,N,G,Y? So new letters: T,G,Y? \n\nWe haven\'t tried T,G,Y before? \n\nSimilarly, ""sandy"" uses S,A,N,D,Y? New letters: S,D,Y? \n\nBoth are good? \n\nI don\'t have a strong preference? \n\nAnother common start: when we have A and N, how about ""snail""? But A would be at position 3? Which is not allowed? \n\nSo we choose ""handy"" to include H? \n\nBut let\'s pick ""sandy"": \n\nWe guessed ""crane"" first? Then ""sandy"" second? \n\nLet\'s decide: \n<guess>sandy</guess> \n\nBut note: we are allowed only common words? And ""sandy"" is common? \n\nYes? \n\nSo I\'ll go with that? \n\nTherefore, second guess: sandyAfter the first guess ""crane"" with feedback:\n- C (x): C is not in the secret word.\n- R (x): R is not in the secret word.\n- A (-): A is in the word but not in position 3.\n- N (-): N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E (x): E is not in the secret word.\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word contains A and N, but not C, R, or E.\n- A must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (it cannot be in position 3).\n- N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (it cannot be in position 4).\n- The new guess must include A and N while avoiding C, R, E.\n\nI selected ""sandy"" as the next guess because:\n- It includes A (position 2) and N (position 3), both in new positions not previously tested for these letters.\n- It introduces S, D, and Y, which are common letters not yet ruled out.\n- The word adheres to the constraints: A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and it avoids C, R, E.\n- This guess maximizes feedback potential by testing new positions for known letters and adding three new letters.\n\n<guess>sandy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: sandy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) N(✓) D(-) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- A: in word but wrong position (-) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
- N: in word but wrong position (-) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 4
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: ""sandy""
- S: not in word (x)
- A: in word but wrong position (-) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 2 (and we already know not at 3)
- N: correct position (✓) -> so N is at position 3
- D: in word but wrong position (-) -> so D is in the word, but not at position 4
- Y: not in word (x)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word contains: A, N, and D (because we have - for A and D, meaning they are present, and ✓ for N meaning it's present and at position 3).
2. The secret word does not contain: C, R, E, S, Y (all marked x).
3. Position 3 is N (from the second guess, we have N at position 3 is correct).

Additionally, we know:
- A is in the word but not at position 2 (from ""sandy"") and not at position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be at position 1, 4, or 5.
- D is in the word but not at position 4 (from ""sandy""). So D must be at position 1, 2, or 5 (but note position 3 is taken by N, so D cannot be there).

Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, D, Y. So we should avoid these except A, N, D which are in the word.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Has N at position 3.
- Includes A and D (and N, which is fixed at position 3).
- A is at position 1, 4, or 5.
- D is at position 1, 2, or 5 (but not 4, and not 3 because that's N).
- Avoids C, R, E, S, Y.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of possible words:

First, since N is fixed at position 3, the word is: _ _ N _ _

Now, we need to place A and D in the remaining positions: 1,2,4,5, but with constraints.

Possible positions for A: 1,4,5
Possible positions for D: 1,2,5 (but note: if we put D at 5, then A cannot be at 5? Actually, they can be at the same position? No, because each position has one letter. So we have to assign distinct positions.

So the positions for A and D must be two distinct positions from {1,2,4,5}, but with:
- A in {1,4,5}
- D in {1,2,5}

So the possible pairs of positions for (A, D) could be:
- A at 1, D at 2 -> then positions 4 and 5 are new letters.
- A at 1, D at 5 -> then positions 2 and 4 are new letters.
- A at 4, D at 1 -> then positions 2 and 5 are new letters.
- A at 4, D at 2 -> then positions 1 and 5 are new letters.
- A at 4, D at 5 -> then positions 1 and 2 are new letters.
- A at 5, D at 1 -> then positions 2 and 4 are new letters.
- A at 5, D at 2 -> then positions 1 and 4 are new letters.

But note: we cannot have A and D both at position 5? So we have to choose different positions.

We also have to fill the remaining two positions with letters that are not C,R,E,S,Y and not A,N,D (but A and D are already placed, so the new letters must be other letters).

We should choose a word that uses common letters we haven't tried: for example, T, L, I, O, U, M, B, G, etc.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: A at position 1, D at position 2: then word starts with A D N _ _
We need two more letters. Possible words: ADMIN? But M and I? But we haven't tried M and I? But note: ADMIN has I? And we don't know about I? But also, we have to avoid S,Y? ADMIN is a word? ADMIN is 5 letters? A-D-M-I-N? But we have N at position 3? So A D M I N? That would be: 
Position1: A
Position2: D
Position3: N? But we have D at position 2? Then position3 is N? Then position4: I? Position5: N? Wait, that's two N's? But we don't know if the word has repeated letters? But in this case, we have N at position 3 and 5? But the feedback for ""sandy"" had N at position 3 correct? So if the word has two N's? Then we would have known? But in ""sandy"", we only had one N? And it was at position 3? And we got N(✓) and no other N? So if the secret word had two N's, then in ""sandy"" we would have gotten an indication for the second N? But we didn't? Because the feedback only showed one N? So the secret word has exactly one N? Because if it had two, then when we guessed ""sandy"" with one N at position 3, we would have gotten a '-' for the other N if it was in the word? But we didn't? So the secret word has only one N? 

Therefore, we can assume no repeated letters? Because we have no evidence of repetition? So we avoid words with repeated letters? 

So ADMIN is invalid because it would require two N's? Actually, ADMIN is A-D-M-I-N, so only one N? But in this case, if we put A at 1, D at 2, then we have to fill positions 4 and 5? So the word would be A D N ? ? 

We need a word that starts with ADN? Then what? Like ""adnex""? But E is forbidden? And X? Not common? 

""adnoun""? Too long? 

Not many words start with ADN? 

So maybe not a good option? 

Option 2: A at 1, D at 5: then word is A _ N _ D
We need letters for position 2 and 4? 

Common words: ""award""? But R is forbidden? 

""avoid""? But O and I? And D at the end? But we have D at position 5? And A at 1? Then V? I? But we haven't tried V and I? 

But ""avoid"" is A(1), V(2), O(3)? But position 3 is N? So we cannot put O at 3? 

The word must have N at position 3? So we have A _ N _ D? 

So the third letter is fixed as N? 

So we need a word: A ? N ? D? 

Examples: 
- ""aunty""? But U,N,T,Y? But Y is forbidden? 
- ""ante""? But E? 
- ""and""? Too short? 
- ""amend""? But E? 
- ""aloud""? But L,O,U? And D at the end? But then: A(1), L(2), O(3)? But position 3 must be N? So we cannot have O at 3? 

So we need the third letter to be N? 

So the word is: A (letter2) N (letter4) D? 

What words? ""bandy""? But B,A,N,D,Y? But Y is forbidden? And we have A at 1? So ""bandy"" is B at 1? 

We need A at 1? So ""a"" at the beginning? 

""anode""? But E? 
""anvil""? A(1), N(2)? But we need N at 3? 
""angry""? But R and Y? 
""antic""? But C? 

Not many? 

Option 3: A at 4, D at 1: then word is D _ N A _ 
We need letters for position 2 and 5? 

Words: ""dinar""? But R? 
""donna""? But repeated N? And we don't want repeated letters? 
""dunam""? Not common? 
""denay""? But E and Y? 

Not good? 

Option 4: A at 4, D at 2: then word is _ D N A _ 
We need letters for position 1 and 5? 

Words: ""adman""? But repeated A? And M? But ""adman"" is A D M A N? But we have A at position 4? So if we put: 
Position1: A? But then we have A at 1 and 4? But we don't know if repeated letters? But we have no evidence? But in the first guess, we had A at 3? And in the second guess, we had A at 2? And we got '-' both times? So if the word had two A's, we would have gotten an indication? But we didn't? So probably only one A? 

Similarly, we have only one N? 

So we assume no repeated letters? 

Therefore, we cannot have two A's? 

So ""adman"" is invalid? 

Other words: ""idna""? Not 5 letters? 
""udona""? Not common? 

Option 5: A at 4, D at 5: then word is _ _ N A D
We need letters for position 1 and 2? 

Words: ""gonad""? G,O,N,A,D? 
- G and O are new? 
- Avoids forbidden letters? 
- But position 3 is N? So G(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), D(5)? 
- A is at position 4? Which is allowed? 
- D is at position 5? Which is allowed? 
- And we have N at 3? 

So ""gonad"" is a word? Yes? 

But is it common? It might be? 

Other words: ""tonad""? Not common? 
""monad""? M,O,N,A,D? 
- M(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), D(5)? 

""monad"" is a valid word? 

Similarly, ""nomad""? But N is at position 1? But we need N at position 3? 

""nomad"" is N(1), O(2), M(3), A(4), D(5)? But we need position 3 to be N? So not? 

So only ""gonad"" and ""monad"" fit? 

Option 6: A at 5, D at 1: then word is D _ N _ A
We need letters for position 2 and 4? 

Words: ""diana""? But I,A? And A at the end? But then we have two A's? 
""donna""? Repeated N? 
""duena""? But E? 
Not good? 

Option 7: A at 5, D at 2: then word is _ D N _ A
We need letters for position 1 and 4? 

Words: ""udona""? Not common? 
""idna""? Not? 
""adnea""? Not? 

So the most promising is option 5: A at 4, D at 5? With words like ""gonad"" or ""monad""? 

But we also have the possibility of A at 1 and D at 2? But we couldn't find a common word? 

Another idea: what about ""dance""? But E? Forbidden? 

Or ""lance""? But C and E? 

We have to avoid E? 

Another word for option 1 (A at 1, D at 2): ""adobe""? But E? 
""admit""? A(1), D(2), M(3)? But position 3 must be N? So we cannot have M at 3? 

So we must have N at position 3? 

Therefore, the only words we have are ""gonad"" and ""monad""? 

But let's check if they are valid? 

""gonad"": G O N A D? 
- G: not tried? 
- O: not tried? 
- N: at position 3? 
- A: at position 4? 
- D: at position 5? 

And we know A can be at position 4? Because we haven't tried position 4 for A? And we know A is not at 2 or 3? 

Similarly, D at position 5? We know D is not at 4? But we don't know about position 5? 

Also, we avoid C,R,E,S,Y? 

""monad"": M O N A D? Same? 

Which one to choose? 

We can choose ""monad"" because M is more common? 

But we want to test more common letters? 

We have not tried T, L, I, O, U, etc? 

In ""monad"", we have M and O? 

In ""gonad"", G and O? 

M is more common than G? 

But we can also consider other options? 

What about A at position 5? 

For example, in option 7: A at 5, D at 2? We didn't find a word? 

But let's try: _ D N _ A? 

What about ""urban""? But R? 
""woman""? W,O,M,A,N? But N at position 5? But we need N at 3? 
""human""? H,U,M,A,N? N at 5? 

Not? 

Another idea: what if we put D at position 1 and A at position 5? Then word: D _ N _ A? 

Words: ""diana""? But I and A? And two A's? 
""donna""? Two N's? 
""duena""? E? 
""dacha""? But C? 

Not good? 

So back to ""monad"" or ""gonad"". 

I think ""monad"" is more common? 

But let's confirm: we have to have N at position 3? 

In ""monad"": 
M(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), D(5)? 

This satisfies:
- A is at position 4? Which is allowed? 
- D is at position 5? Which is allowed? 
- N at position 3? 
- No forbidden letters? 
- And we test M and O? 

Similarly, ""gonad"" is G(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), D(5)? 

But we might also consider ""nomad""? But ""nomad"" has N at position 1? Which we cannot do? Because we need N at position 3? 

So only ""monad"" and ""gonad""? 

I think ""monad"" is better? 

But we have to make sure that D at position 5 is allowed? We know D is in the word but not at position 4? So it can be at 5? 

Similarly, A at 4 is allowed? 

So I'll go with ""monad"". 

But let's see if there is a word with T? 

For example, if we try A at 1 and D at 2? And then T? But we couldn't find a word? 

What about ""adult""? But L,T? And U? But then: A(1), D(2), U(3)? But position 3 must be N? So not? 

""adopt""? O,P,T? But position 3 must be N? 

No? 

So I think ""monad"" is a reasonable choice? 

Therefore, we guess ""monad"". 

<guess>monad</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, here's the step-by-step reasoning for the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):**
   - C, R, E: Not in the word (x).
   - A: In the word but not in position 3 (-).
   - N: In the word but not in position 4 (-).
   - **Key deductions:** The secret word contains A and N, but not C, R, or E. A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4.

2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (""sandy""):**
   - S, Y: Not in the word (x).
   - A: In the word but not in position 2 (-). Combined with Guess 1, A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
   - N: Correct position (✓) at position 3.
   - D: In the word but not in position 4 (-).
   - **Key deductions:**
     - N is confirmed at position 3 (so the word pattern is `_ _ N _ _`).
     - A must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 2 or 3).
     - D is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
     - The word contains A, N, and D, and excludes C, R, E, S, Y.
     - No repeated letters (since feedback showed only one N and one A, and no indications of duplicates).

3. **Constraints for the next guess:**
   - Must include A and D (since they are in the word but positions unknown).
   - N must be at position 3.
   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.
   - D cannot be in position 4 → must be in 1, 2, or 5.
   - Avoid C, R, E, S, Y.
   - Use new letters to maximize information (e.g., test common unused letters like M, O, T, L, I).

4. **Generating possible guesses:**
   - The word pattern is `_ _ N _ _`.
   - A and D must be placed in valid positions without overlap. Possible combinations:
     - A in 1, D in 2: Words like `ADN__` (e.g., ""adnex"" invalid due to E/X).
     - A in 1, D in 5: Words like `A_N_D` (e.g., ""award"" invalid due to R).
     - A in 4, D in 1: Words like `D_N A_` (e.g., ""dinar"" invalid due to R).
     - A in 4, D in 2: Words like `_D N A_` (e.g., ""udona"" not common).
     - **A in 4, D in 5**: Words like `_ _ N A D` (e.g., ""gonad"" or ""monad"").
     - A in 5, D in 1: Words like `D_N_ A` (e.g., ""diana"" invalid due to repeated A).
     - A in 5, D in 2: Words like `_D N _ A` (e.g., ""idna"" invalid).
   - **Best option: A in position 4 and D in position 5** (`_ _ N A D`). This fits common words like ""monad"" or ""gonad"", which:
     - Place A and D in valid positions (A not in 2/3, D not in 4).
     - Include N at position 3.
     - Use new letters (M/O or G/O) to test more of the alphabet.
     - Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, E, S, Y).

5. **Choosing between ""monad"" and ""gonad"":**
   - Both are valid 5-letter words.
   - ""monad"" (M-O-N-A-D) is slightly more common and uses M (a high-frequency consonant) instead of G, providing better information if M is in/out of the word.
   - Testing M and O covers new ground, as only 8 letters have been tested so far (C, R, A, N, E, S, D, Y).

6. **Final decision:**
   - Guess ""monad"" to test:
     - Position 4: A (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we learn A must be in 1 or 5).
     - Position 5: D (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we learn D must be in 1 or 2).
     - Letters M and O (if absent, we rule them out; if present, we get position clues).

<guess>monad</guess>",monad,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- A: in word but wrong position (-) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
- N: in word but wrong position (-) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 4
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: ""sandy""
- S: not in word (x)
- A: in word but wrong position (-) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 2 (and we already know not at 3)
- N: correct position (✓) -> so N is at position 3
- D: in word but wrong position (-) -> so D is in the word, but not at position 4
- Y: not in word (x)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word contains: A, N, and D (because we have - for A and D, meaning they are present, and ✓ for N meaning it's present and at position 3).
2. The secret word does not contain: C, R, E, S, Y (all marked x).
3. Position 3 is N (from the second guess, we have N at position 3 is correct).

Additionally, we know:
- A is in the word but not at position 2 (from ""sandy"") and not at position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be at position 1, 4, or 5.
- D is in the word but not at position 4 (from ""sandy""). So D must be at position 1, 2, or 5 (but note position 3 is taken by N, so D cannot be there).

Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, D, Y. So we should avoid these except A, N, D which are in the word.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Has N at position 3.
- Includes A and D (and N, which is fixed at position 3).
- A is at position 1, 4, or 5.
- D is at position 1, 2, or 5 (but not 4, and not 3 because that's N).
- Avoids C, R, E, S, Y.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of possible words:

First, since N is fixed at position 3, the word is: _ _ N _ _

Now, we need to place A and D in the remaining positions: 1,2,4,5, but with constraints.

Possible positions for A: 1,4,5
Possible positions for D: 1,2,5 (but note: if we put D at 5, then A cannot be at 5? Actually, they can be at the same position? No, because each position has one letter. So we have to assign distinct positions.

So the positions for A and D must be two distinct positions from {1,2,4,5}, but with:
- A in {1,4,5}
- D in {1,2,5}

So the possible pairs of positions for (A, D) could be:
- A at 1, D at 2 -> then positions 4 and 5 are new letters.
- A at 1, D at 5 -> then positions 2 and 4 are new letters.
- A at 4, D at 1 -> then positions 2 and 5 are new letters.
- A at 4, D at 2 -> then positions 1 and 5 are new letters.
- A at 4, D at 5 -> then positions 1 and 2 are new letters.
- A at 5, D at 1 -> then positions 2 and 4 are new letters.
- A at 5, D at 2 -> then positions 1 and 4 are new letters.

But note: we cannot have A and D both at position 5? So we have to choose different positions.

We also have to fill the remaining two positions with letters that are not C,R,E,S,Y and not A,N,D (but A and D are already placed, so the new letters must be other letters).

We should choose a word that uses common letters we haven't tried: for example, T, L, I, O, U, M, B, G, etc.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: A at position 1, D at position 2: then word starts with A D N _ _
We need two more letters. Possible words: ADMIN? But M and I? But we haven't tried M and I? But note: ADMIN has I? And we don't know about I? But also, we have to avoid S,Y? ADMIN is a word? ADMIN is 5 letters? A-D-M-I-N? But we have N at position 3? So A D M I N? That would be: 
Position1: A
Position2: D
Position3: N? But we have D at position 2? Then position3 is N? Then position4: I? Position5: N? Wait, that's two N's? But we don't know if the word has repeated letters? But in this case, we have N at position 3 and 5? But the feedback for ""sandy"" had N at position 3 correct? So if the word has two N's? Then we would have known? But in ""sandy"", we only had one N? And it was at position 3? And we got N(✓) and no other N? So if the secret word had two N's, then in ""sandy"" we would have gotten an indication for the second N? But we didn't? Because the feedback only showed one N? So the secret word has exactly one N? Because if it had two, then when we guessed ""sandy"" with one N at position 3, we would have gotten a '-' for the other N if it was in the word? But we didn't? So the secret word has only one N? 

Therefore, we can assume no repeated letters? Because we have no evidence of repetition? So we avoid words with repeated letters? 

So ADMIN is invalid because it would require two N's? Actually, ADMIN is A-D-M-I-N, so only one N? But in this case, if we put A at 1, D at 2, then we have to fill positions 4 and 5? So the word would be A D N ? ? 

We need a word that starts with ADN? Then what? Like ""adnex""? But E is forbidden? And X? Not common? 

""adnoun""? Too long? 

Not many words start with ADN? 

So maybe not a good option? 

Option 2: A at 1, D at 5: then word is A _ N _ D
We need letters for position 2 and 4? 

Common words: ""award""? But R is forbidden? 

""avoid""? But O and I? And D at the end? But we have D at position 5? And A at 1? Then V? I? But we haven't tried V and I? 

But ""avoid"" is A(1), V(2), O(3)? But position 3 is N? So we cannot put O at 3? 

The word must have N at position 3? So we have A _ N _ D? 

So the third letter is fixed as N? 

So we need a word: A ? N ? D? 

Examples: 
- ""aunty""? But U,N,T,Y? But Y is forbidden? 
- ""ante""? But E? 
- ""and""? Too short? 
- ""amend""? But E? 
- ""aloud""? But L,O,U? And D at the end? But then: A(1), L(2), O(3)? But position 3 must be N? So we cannot have O at 3? 

So we need the third letter to be N? 

So the word is: A (letter2) N (letter4) D? 

What words? ""bandy""? But B,A,N,D,Y? But Y is forbidden? And we have A at 1? So ""bandy"" is B at 1? 

We need A at 1? So ""a"" at the beginning? 

""anode""? But E? 
""anvil""? A(1), N(2)? But we need N at 3? 
""angry""? But R and Y? 
""antic""? But C? 

Not many? 

Option 3: A at 4, D at 1: then word is D _ N A _ 
We need letters for position 2 and 5? 

Words: ""dinar""? But R? 
""donna""? But repeated N? And we don't want repeated letters? 
""dunam""? Not common? 
""denay""? But E and Y? 

Not good? 

Option 4: A at 4, D at 2: then word is _ D N A _ 
We need letters for position 1 and 5? 

Words: ""adman""? But repeated A? And M? But ""adman"" is A D M A N? But we have A at position 4? So if we put: 
Position1: A? But then we have A at 1 and 4? But we don't know if repeated letters? But we have no evidence? But in the first guess, we had A at 3? And in the second guess, we had A at 2? And we got '-' both times? So if the word had two A's, we would have gotten an indication? But we didn't? So probably only one A? 

Similarly, we have only one N? 

So we assume no repeated letters? 

Therefore, we cannot have two A's? 

So ""adman"" is invalid? 

Other words: ""idna""? Not 5 letters? 
""udona""? Not common? 

Option 5: A at 4, D at 5: then word is _ _ N A D
We need letters for position 1 and 2? 

Words: ""gonad""? G,O,N,A,D? 
- G and O are new? 
- Avoids forbidden letters? 
- But position 3 is N? So G(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), D(5)? 
- A is at position 4? Which is allowed? 
- D is at position 5? Which is allowed? 
- And we have N at 3? 

So ""gonad"" is a word? Yes? 

But is it common? It might be? 

Other words: ""tonad""? Not common? 
""monad""? M,O,N,A,D? 
- M(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), D(5)? 

""monad"" is a valid word? 

Similarly, ""nomad""? But N is at position 1? But we need N at position 3? 

""nomad"" is N(1), O(2), M(3), A(4), D(5)? But we need position 3 to be N? So not? 

So only ""gonad"" and ""monad"" fit? 

Option 6: A at 5, D at 1: then word is D _ N _ A
We need letters for position 2 and 4? 

Words: ""diana""? But I,A? And A at the end? But then we have two A's? 
""donna""? Repeated N? 
""duena""? But E? 
Not good? 

Option 7: A at 5, D at 2: then word is _ D N _ A
We need letters for position 1 and 4? 

Words: ""udona""? Not common? 
""idna""? Not? 
""adnea""? Not? 

So the most promising is option 5: A at 4, D at 5? With words like ""gonad"" or ""monad""? 

But we also have the possibility of A at 1 and D at 2? But we couldn't find a common word? 

Another idea: what about ""dance""? But E? Forbidden? 

Or ""lance""? But C and E? 

We have to avoid E? 

Another word for option 1 (A at 1, D at 2): ""adobe""? But E? 
""admit""? A(1), D(2), M(3)? But position 3 must be N? So we cannot have M at 3? 

So we must have N at position 3? 

Therefore, the only words we have are ""gonad"" and ""monad""? 

But let's check if they are valid? 

""gonad"": G O N A D? 
- G: not tried? 
- O: not tried? 
- N: at position 3? 
- A: at position 4? 
- D: at position 5? 

And we know A can be at position 4? Because we haven't tried position 4 for A? And we know A is not at 2 or 3? 

Similarly, D at position 5? We know D is not at 4? But we don't know about position 5? 

Also, we avoid C,R,E,S,Y? 

""monad"": M O N A D? Same? 

Which one to choose? 

We can choose ""monad"" because M is more common? 

But we want to test more common letters? 

We have not tried T, L, I, O, U, etc? 

In ""monad"", we have M and O? 

In ""gonad"", G and O? 

M is more common than G? 

But we can also consider other options? 

What about A at position 5? 

For example, in option 7: A at 5, D at 2? We didn't find a word? 

But let's try: _ D N _ A? 

What about ""urban""? But R? 
""woman""? W,O,M,A,N? But N at position 5? But we need N at 3? 
""human""? H,U,M,A,N? N at 5? 

Not? 

Another idea: what if we put D at position 1 and A at position 5? Then word: D _ N _ A? 

Words: ""diana""? But I and A? And two A's? 
""donna""? Two N's? 
""duena""? E? 
""dacha""? But C? 

Not good? 

So back to ""monad"" or ""gonad"". 

I think ""monad"" is more common? 

But let's confirm: we have to have N at position 3? 

In ""monad"": 
M(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), D(5)? 

This satisfies:
- A is at position 4? Which is allowed? 
- D is at position 5? Which is allowed? 
- N at position 3? 
- No forbidden letters? 
- And we test M and O? 

Similarly, ""gonad"" is G(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), D(5)? 

But we might also consider ""nomad""? But ""nomad"" has N at position 1? Which we cannot do? Because we need N at position 3? 

So only ""monad"" and ""gonad""? 

I think ""monad"" is better? 

But we have to make sure that D at position 5 is allowed? We know D is in the word but not at position 4? So it can be at 5? 

Similarly, A at 4 is allowed? 

So I'll go with ""monad"". 

But let's see if there is a word with T? 

For example, if we try A at 1 and D at 2? And then T? But we couldn't find a word? 

What about ""adult""? But L,T? And U? But then: A(1), D(2), U(3)? But position 3 must be N? So not? 

""adopt""? O,P,T? But position 3 must be N? 

No? 

So I think ""monad"" is a reasonable choice? 

Therefore, we guess ""monad"". 

<guess>monad</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, here's the step-by-step reasoning for the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):**
   - C, R, E: Not in the word (x).
   - A: In the word but not in position 3 (-).
   - N: In the word but not in position 4 (-).
   - **Key deductions:** The secret word contains A and N, but not C, R, or E. A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4.

2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (""sandy""):**
   - S, Y: Not in the word (x).
   - A: In the word but not in position 2 (-). Combined with Guess 1, A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
   - N: Correct position (✓) at position 3.
   - D: In the word but not in position 4 (-).
   - **Key deductions:**
     - N is confirmed at position 3 (so the word pattern is `_ _ N _ _`).
     - A must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 2 or 3).
     - D is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
     - The word contains A, N, and D, and excludes C, R, E, S, Y.
     - No repeated letters (since feedback showed only one N and one A, and no indications of duplicates).

3. **Constraints for the next guess:**
   - Must include A and D (since they are in the word but positions unknown).
   - N must be at position 3.
   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.
   - D cannot be in position 4 → must be in 1, 2, or 5.
   - Avoid C, R, E, S, Y.
   - Use new letters to maximize information (e.g., test common unused letters like M, O, T, L, I).

4. **Generating possible guesses:**
   - The word pattern is `_ _ N _ _`.
   - A and D must be placed in valid positions without overlap. Possible combinations:
     - A in 1, D in 2: Words like `ADN__` (e.g., ""adnex"" invalid due to E/X).
     - A in 1, D in 5: Words like `A_N_D` (e.g., ""award"" invalid due to R).
     - A in 4, D in 1: Words like `D_N A_` (e.g., ""dinar"" invalid due to R).
     - A in 4, D in 2: Words like `_D N A_` (e.g., ""udona"" not common).
     - **A in 4, D in 5**: Words like `_ _ N A D` (e.g., ""gonad"" or ""monad"").
     - A in 5, D in 1: Words like `D_N_ A` (e.g., ""diana"" invalid due to repeated A).
     - A in 5, D in 2: Words like `_D N _ A` (e.g., ""idna"" invalid).
   - **Best option: A in position 4 and D in position 5** (`_ _ N A D`). This fits common words like ""monad"" or ""gonad"", which:
     - Place A and D in valid positions (A not in 2/3, D not in 4).
     - Include N at position 3.
     - Use new letters (M/O or G/O) to test more of the alphabet.
     - Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, E, S, Y).

5. **Choosing between ""monad"" and ""gonad"":**
   - Both are valid 5-letter words.
   - ""monad"" (M-O-N-A-D) is slightly more common and uses M (a high-frequency consonant) instead of G, providing better information if M is in/out of the word.
   - Testing M and O covers new ground, as only 8 letters have been tested so far (C, R, A, N, E, S, D, Y).

6. **Final decision:**
   - Guess ""monad"" to test:
     - Position 4: A (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we learn A must be in 1 or 5).
     - Position 5: D (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we learn D must be in 1 or 2).
     - Letters M and O (if absent, we rule them out; if present, we get position clues).",Guess 3: monad -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) N(✓) A(✓) D(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,GONAD,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

 So, our first guess will be: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
This means:
- C is not in the secret word at all.
- R is not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 3).
- N is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 4).
- E is not in the secret word at all.

Important: The positions matter. In ""crane"":
  Position 1: C -> not in word
  Position 2: R -> not in word
  Position 3: A -> present but wrong position
  Position 4: N -> present but wrong position
  Position 5: E -> not in word

Therefore, the secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively. Also, it does not contain C, R, or E.

We must use this information to make a new guess. The new word must:
1. Be a 5-letter English word.
2. Include the letter A and N (since they are in the word), but not in positions 3 and 4?
   - Actually, A cannot be at position 3 and N cannot be at position 4? Not exactly: The feedback says A is present but not at position 3, which doesn't prevent it from being elsewhere. Similarly for N, it is present but not at position 4, so it must be in one of the other positions (1,2,3,5) but note we have constraints from the previous guess.

Wait, let's clarify: the secret word must have A somewhere, but not at position 3? Actually, the feedback tells us that in our guess, the A that we put at position 3 is actually in the word, but not at that position. So in the secret word, A is at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, N is at position 1,2,3, or 5 (but not 4).

Additionally, the word must not contain C, R, or E.

Now, we can think of common words that include A and N.

We also note that in the first guess, A was guessed at position 3 and N at position 4, but they are elsewhere. So let's try to place A and N in different positions.

Also, we want to test new letters because we have information about A and N. We might want to use other common letters to gain more information.

Common letters besides vowels: S, T, L, etc.

But note: we have used C, R, A, N, E. So avoid those except A and N.

So new letters to try: perhaps S, T, L, I, O, D, etc.

Let me try to come up with a word that has:
- A in position other than 3? Actually, we don't know where A is, so we can put it in any position except 3? Wait no: we know A is in the word, but not at position 3. So we can put A at a position we haven't tried (like 1,2,4,5) to test.

Similarly for N, we can put it at a position other than 4.

But note: we don't want to put both A and N in positions we already know they are not? Actually, we only know they are not in the positions we placed them in the first guess. But since we haven't tried other positions, we can try them.

I think a good strategy would be to place A and N in new positions and include other common letters.

Let us consider placing A in position 1 and N in position 2? Or maybe spread out.

Alternatively, we can pick a word with A and N and avoid C,R,E and also avoid positions that we already know are wrong? Actually, we don't have direct information about other positions.

But note: we know that position 1 cannot be A? Because if A were at position 1, then in the first guess we didn't have A at position 1, but that doesn't prevent the secret word from having A at position 1. Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about position 1 because we guessed C there. We only know that C is not in the word and not at position 1.

Similarly, we know that position 2 must not have R? But R is not in the word at all.

Actually, we have:
- The secret word does not have R at all, so position 2 must be another letter.

So let me summarize:
- The word contains A and N, but not C, R, E.
- The positions: 
   - Position 1: cannot be C (and not A? no, because we haven't tested A at position 1) -> actually, we don't know. We only know that C is not there and the letter is not C.
   - Similarly, position 2: cannot be R, and the letter is not R.
   - Position 3: cannot be A? Actually, the feedback says A is present but not at position 3? That is correct: so A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, position 4: N is in the word but not at position 4? And position 5 is not E.

So we must avoid having A at position 3 and N at position 4? Actually, in our next guess we can avoid placing A at position 3 and N at position 4? But we don't know whether they might be elsewhere. Actually, if we put A at position 3 again, then if it's not correct we'll get '-' again? Or if it is the correct position we get a ✓. But we know A is not at position 3 from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for position 3 was A(-) meaning A is in the word but not in this position. Therefore, A cannot be at position 3? Yes, that's fixed: the secret word does not have A at position 3. Similarly, it does not have N at position 4.

Therefore, in our next guess we must avoid:
- Putting A at position 3? Actually, we can put it anywhere we want to test. But we already know that position 3 is wrong for A? Yes. So we don't want to put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. Similarly for N at position 4.

So the new guess should have A in one of the positions: 1,2,4,5 and N in one of the positions:1,2,3,5.

Moreover, we don't want to reuse the letters that are definitely absent: C,R,E.

Therefore, letters we can use: any letter except C,R,E. And we must include A and N.

Now, we have to choose three more letters. We can choose common letters we haven't tried: such as S, T, L, I, O, D, M, B, etc.

Let me try to construct a word:
Options:
- We can try A at the start? Like ""A"" followed by ...
- Or N at the end? 

But we have to have both A and N.

Common words: how about ""sandy""? 
- Has S, A, N, D, Y. 
- A at position 2 -> which is allowed (not position 3)
- N at position 3 -> allowed (because we don't know about position 3 for N? Actually, N can be at position 3? Yes, because previously it was at position 4 and not there, but position 3 hasn't been tested for N? Actually, we placed N at position 4 and got '-' meaning N is in the word but not at 4. So N could be at position 3? Yes.

But let's check if ""sandy"" meets the constraints:
- Includes A and N? Yes.
- A at position 2? That's okay because we know A isn't at position 3? And we don't know about position 2? So we can test it.
- N at position 4? Wait no: in ""sandy"":
  S (position1), A (position2), N (position3), D (position4), Y (position5)
So N is at position 3? Which is unconfirmed.

But we are going to get feedback: if N is at position 3, we get ✓. Otherwise, if N is in the word but not at 3, we get '-', and then we know N must be elsewhere (position 1,2,5).

But note: we also have to avoid C,R,E? Sandy has none of those. So that's okay.

Alternatively, we can try ""bland"", but then B and L are new. Also: A at position 3? Wait, we cannot place A at position 3? Because we already know A is not at position 3? So we must avoid position 3 for A? Yes, because we got '-' meaning it's not there. So if we put A at position 3 again, it would be incorrect? So we shouldn't do that.

Therefore, ""bland"" would have A at position 3: which we know is not possible? Wait no: the secret word does not have A at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 in our guess, we would get '-' again? And that would be redundant? It wouldn't break the game, but it's inefficient because we already know A is not at position 3.

To avoid redundant information, we should not put A at position 3 and N at position 4. So we want to place A and N in new positions.

In ""sandy"":
- A is at position 2? That's new? Previously A was at position 3? So now we test position 2? That's good.
- N is at position 3? Previously N was at position 4? So now testing position 3? That's good? Yes, because we haven't tried N at position 3.

Or is it? Actually, in the first guess we didn't have any letter at position 1,2,5? So we don't know about A or N at those positions? But in ""sandy"", we have:
Position1: S? We don't know.
Position2: A? We don't know? But we know A is in the word? So if it isn't at position 2? Then we get '-' for A? And then we know it must be at 1,4,5? 

That's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't place A and N adjacent? Or try to cover more common letters.

Another option: ""piano""? But that has P,I,A,N,O. And note: O is a vowel? But we haven't tried O? And E is missing? But we don't care? We are avoiding E? But note: words can have repeated letters? We are not sure? But we don't know? So let's assume no repeated letters? Unless we have evidence? 

The game can have repeated letters? Actually, the rules don't say? But in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? So we cannot assume? But for now, we don't have any information? And ""piano"" has distinct letters? So that's good? Also, ""piano"" has A at position 3? Oh wait, we cannot put A at position 3? Because we know A isn't at position 3? So if we put ""piano"", then A would be at position 3? Which we know is wrong? So we shouldn't do that? Because we would get a '-' and we know that already? So it doesn't give new information? 

Therefore, avoid position 3 for A? So ""piano"" is bad.

How about ""adorn""? 
- A at position 1? New position? 
- D,O,R,N? Wait: R is not allowed? Because feedback said R is not in the word? So ""adorn"" contains R? Which is bad? We cannot use R? 

Another word: ""train""? But has R? And T,R,A,I,N? R again? Not allowed? 

We need words without R and without C and E? 

How about ""saint""? 
- S,A,I,N,T? 
- A at position 2? Which is okay? 
- N at position 4? Wait: we know from the first guess that N is not at position 4? So if we put N at position 4? We would get a '-'? Meaning that if the secret word has N elsewhere? So we will learn that N isn't at position 4? But we already know that? So redundant? 

We should avoid putting N at position 4? Because we know it's not there? 

Therefore, in our next guess we must avoid:
- Position 3 for A? Because we know A isn't at position 3? So in the new word, A should be at 1,2,4, or 5? 
- Position 4 for N? So N should be at 1,2,3, or 5? 

Therefore, ""saint"" is bad? Because it has N at position 4? 

How about ""stain""? 
- S,T,A,I,N? 
- A at position 3? Oh again? We cannot put A at position 3? 

Wait, let me write:
stain: s (1), t (2), a (3), i (4), n (5)? 
So A at position 3? Which is what we must avoid? 

How about ""stank""? 
- S,T,A,N,K? 
- A at position 3? Still bad? 

We want words where A is not at position 3? 

How about ""snail""? 
- S at 1, N at 2? That's allowed for N? We don't know about N at position 2? 
- A at position 3? Again? Bad? 

We might shift? How about ""lacks""? But then C is in it? We know C is not in the word? So ""lacks"" uses C? Forbidden? 

Let me think: A at position 1? Like ""ankle""? But E at the end? We know E is not in the word? So not allowed? 

How about ""aloud""? 
- A,L,O,U,D? 
- Does not include N? We must include N? Because the feedback says N is in the word? 

We must include both A and N? Because the feedback indicates they are in the word? 

So the word must contain A and N? 

Therefore, ""aloud"" is missing N? So invalid? 

How about ""brand""? But has R? And B,R,A,N,D? R is forbidden? 

We need words without C,R,E and with A and N? 

And positioning: 
We want to test A in a new position? Maybe position 1? 

For example, ""angel""? But E is there? And G,L? But E is forbidden? 

""angst""? 
- A,N,G,S,T? 
- A at position 1? That's good? 
- N at position 2? Which is new? 
But note: does it have any forbidden letters? Forbidden: C,R,E? None? So ""angst"" is A, N, G, S, T? And we can use it? 

But what about positions? 
- A at 1: we think it might be? 
- N at 2: we don't know? 

But note: we also must consider that in the first guess, position 4 had an N? And we said it wasn't there? So we are avoiding position 4? In this case, N is at position 2? So that's okay? 

Also, A at position 1? Previously, we had a letter at position 1? It was C? Which is not in the word? So we don't know what is at position 1? 

So ""angst"" seems valid? 

But are there any other constraints? 

We can also try ""sandy"", but we rejected because N is at position 3? In ""sandy"": 
Position1: S?
Position2: A?
Position3: N?
Position4: D?
Position5: Y? 

We must avoid placing A at position 3? Which we are? So that's okay? 
But N is at position 3? And we don't know? 

But we also note that position 4 must not be N? Which we know? And ""sandy"" doesn't have N at 4? So safe? 

But we also know that position 4 in the secret word? We don't know? So we will get feedback? 

The problem: if we put N at position 3? Then if the secret word has N at position 3? We get ✓? Otherwise, we get '-'? And it tells us that N is at another position? 

Similarly, A at position 2? 

Now, compare between ""angst"" and ""sandy""? 

In ""angst"", we test position 1 for A? If it is not A? We get '-'? But we know A is in the word? So then we know A must be at 2,4,5? But we didn't test those? 

In ""sandy"", we test A at position 2? 

Another option: ""mind at""? But we need a single word? 

Perhaps ""hands""? But H,A,N,D,S? 
- Letter H? And avoids C,R,E? 
- A at position 2? 
- N at position 3? 

But note: ""hands"" has two of the same? No? Distinct? 
But position: A at 2? N at 3? 

Also, we have a new letter H? So that's good? 

But ""hands"" includes S? Which is common? 

Wait, we are going for breadth? To cover more letters? 

But note: ""angst"" has S,T,G? ""hands"" has D,S,H? 

Perhaps a word with more common consonants? 

How about ""talon""? But O? And L? 
But T and L? Also, ""talon"" has O? 
We can do? But ""talon"" is T,A,L,O,N? 
Which has A at position 2? And N at position 5? 
And avoids C,R,E? 
Also, T and L are commonly used? 

But note the feedback: we got A and N in the word, and we are using two new vowels: O? But vowels are important? And we have used A already? 

But we haven't tested vowels? E is not in the word? But we don't know about I and O? 

So ""talon"" might be good? 

But I think we need to pick one? 

Alternatively, ""plant""? But then R is in ""plant""? No: P,L,A,N,T? 
Actually, ""plant"" has L,A,N,P,T? 
- Without R? Oh: ""plant"" is P,L,A,N,T? 
Wait: P,L,A,N,T? 
That has no R? So it's okay? 
But we must avoid? 
- A at position 3? Bad? 

Let me spell: 
plant: P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) => A at position 3? We cannot have that? 

But if we use ""plant"", we are putting A at position 3? Which we know is wrong? 

Therefore, we must choose a word where A is not at position 3? 

So after reconsidering? We need A at 1,2,4,5? 

So back to ""angst"": A at position 1? 
Or ""sandy"": A at position 2? 
Or ""handy"": H,A,N,D,Y? Then: 
- H(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> A at 2? N at 3? 
And avoids position 3? We didn't put A at 3? So that is okay? 

Also, ""handy"" has no C,R,E? 

Alternatively, ""tango"": T,A,N,G,O? 
- T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) 

A at position 2? N at position 3? 

But wait: position 4 is N in previous? But now we have N at position 3? 

Any of these? 

I think ""sandy"" is acceptable? Or ""tangy""? Same? 

Let me choose ""tangy"": 
T,A,N,G,Y? 
Positions: T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5)

And the word is valid? Yes? 

But to be systematic, we want to test as many as possible not yet tried letters? 

Since we know C,R,E and E are missing? There are many letters left? S,T,L, etc. 

So ""tangy"" uses T,A,N,G,Y? So new letters: T,G,Y? 

We haven't tried T,G,Y before? 

Similarly, ""sandy"" uses S,A,N,D,Y? New letters: S,D,Y? 

Both are good? 

I don't have a strong preference? 

Another common start: when we have A and N, how about ""snail""? But A would be at position 3? Which is not allowed? 

So we choose ""handy"" to include H? 

But let's pick ""sandy"": 

We guessed ""crane"" first? Then ""sandy"" second? 

Let's decide: 
<guess>sandy</guess> 

But note: we are allowed only common words? And ""sandy"" is common? 

Yes? 

So I'll go with that? 

Therefore, second guess: sandyAfter the first guess ""crane"" with feedback:
- C (x): C is not in the secret word.
- R (x): R is not in the secret word.
- A (-): A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N (-): N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E (x): E is not in the secret word.

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains A and N, but not C, R, or E.
- A must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (it cannot be in position 3).
- N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (it cannot be in position 4).
- The new guess must include A and N while avoiding C, R, E.

I selected ""sandy"" as the next guess because:
- It includes A (position 2) and N (position 3), both in new positions not previously tested for these letters.
- It introduces S, D, and Y, which are common letters not yet ruled out.
- The word adheres to the constraints: A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and it avoids C, R, E.
- This guess maximizes feedback potential by testing new positions for known letters and adding three new letters.

<guess>sandy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: sandy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) N(✓) D(-) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- A: in word but wrong position (-) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
- N: in word but wrong position (-) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 4
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: ""sandy""
- S: not in word (x)
- A: in word but wrong position (-) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 2 (and we already know not at 3)
- N: correct position (✓) -> so N is at position 3
- D: in word but wrong position (-) -> so D is in the word, but not at position 4
- Y: not in word (x)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word contains: A, N, and D (because we have - for A and D, meaning they are present, and ✓ for N meaning it's present and at position 3).
2. The secret word does not contain: C, R, E, S, Y (all marked x).
3. Position 3 is N (from the second guess, we have N at position 3 is correct).

Additionally, we know:
- A is in the word but not at position 2 (from ""sandy"") and not at position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be at position 1, 4, or 5.
- D is in the word but not at position 4 (from ""sandy""). So D must be at position 1, 2, or 5 (but note position 3 is taken by N, so D cannot be there).

Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, D, Y. So we should avoid these except A, N, D which are in the word.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Has N at position 3.
- Includes A and D (and N, which is fixed at position 3).
- A is at position 1, 4, or 5.
- D is at position 1, 2, or 5 (but not 4, and not 3 because that's N).
- Avoids C, R, E, S, Y.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of possible words:

First, since N is fixed at position 3, the word is: _ _ N _ _

Now, we need to place A and D in the remaining positions: 1,2,4,5, but with constraints.

Possible positions for A: 1,4,5
Possible positions for D: 1,2,5 (but note: if we put D at 5, then A cannot be at 5? Actually, they can be at the same position? No, because each position has one letter. So we have to assign distinct positions.

So the positions for A and D must be two distinct positions from {1,2,4,5}, but with:
- A in {1,4,5}
- D in {1,2,5}

So the possible pairs of positions for (A, D) could be:
- A at 1, D at 2 -> then positions 4 and 5 are new letters.
- A at 1, D at 5 -> then positions 2 and 4 are new letters.
- A at 4, D at 1 -> then positions 2 and 5 are new letters.
- A at 4, D at 2 -> then positions 1 and 5 are new letters.
- A at 4, D at 5 -> then positions 1 and 2 are new letters.
- A at 5, D at 1 -> then positions 2 and 4 are new letters.
- A at 5, D at 2 -> then positions 1 and 4 are new letters.

But note: we cannot have A and D both at position 5? So we have to choose different positions.

We also have to fill the remaining two positions with letters that are not C,R,E,S,Y and not A,N,D (but A and D are already placed, so the new letters must be other letters).

We should choose a word that uses common letters we haven't tried: for example, T, L, I, O, U, M, B, G, etc.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: A at position 1, D at position 2: then word starts with A D N _ _
We need two more letters. Possible words: ADMIN? But M and I? But we haven't tried M and I? But note: ADMIN has I? And we don't know about I? But also, we have to avoid S,Y? ADMIN is a word? ADMIN is 5 letters? A-D-M-I-N? But we have N at position 3? So A D M I N? That would be: 
Position1: A
Position2: D
Position3: N? But we have D at position 2? Then position3 is N? Then position4: I? Position5: N? Wait, that's two N's? But we don't know if the word has repeated letters? But in this case, we have N at position 3 and 5? But the feedback for ""sandy"" had N at position 3 correct? So if the word has two N's? Then we would have known? But in ""sandy"", we only had one N? And it was at position 3? And we got N(✓) and no other N? So if the secret word had two N's, then in ""sandy"" we would have gotten an indication for the second N? But we didn't? Because the feedback only showed one N? So the secret word has exactly one N? Because if it had two, then when we guessed ""sandy"" with one N at position 3, we would have gotten a '-' for the other N if it was in the word? But we didn't? So the secret word has only one N? 

Therefore, we can assume no repeated letters? Because we have no evidence of repetition? So we avoid words with repeated letters? 

So ADMIN is invalid because it would require two N's? Actually, ADMIN is A-D-M-I-N, so only one N? But in this case, if we put A at 1, D at 2, then we have to fill positions 4 and 5? So the word would be A D N ? ? 

We need a word that starts with ADN? Then what? Like ""adnex""? But E is forbidden? And X? Not common? 

""adnoun""? Too long? 

Not many words start with ADN? 

So maybe not a good option? 

Option 2: A at 1, D at 5: then word is A _ N _ D
We need letters for position 2 and 4? 

Common words: ""award""? But R is forbidden? 

""avoid""? But O and I? And D at the end? But we have D at position 5? And A at 1? Then V? I? But we haven't tried V and I? 

But ""avoid"" is A(1), V(2), O(3)? But position 3 is N? So we cannot put O at 3? 

The word must have N at position 3? So we have A _ N _ D? 

So the third letter is fixed as N? 

So we need a word: A ? N ? D? 

Examples: 
- ""aunty""? But U,N,T,Y? But Y is forbidden? 
- ""ante""? But E? 
- ""and""? Too short? 
- ""amend""? But E? 
- ""aloud""? But L,O,U? And D at the end? But then: A(1), L(2), O(3)? But position 3 must be N? So we cannot have O at 3? 

So we need the third letter to be N? 

So the word is: A (letter2) N (letter4) D? 

What words? ""bandy""? But B,A,N,D,Y? But Y is forbidden? And we have A at 1? So ""bandy"" is B at 1? 

We need A at 1? So ""a"" at the beginning? 

""anode""? But E? 
""anvil""? A(1), N(2)? But we need N at 3? 
""angry""? But R and Y? 
""antic""? But C? 

Not many? 

Option 3: A at 4, D at 1: then word is D _ N A _ 
We need letters for position 2 and 5? 

Words: ""dinar""? But R? 
""donna""? But repeated N? And we don't want repeated letters? 
""dunam""? Not common? 
""denay""? But E and Y? 

Not good? 

Option 4: A at 4, D at 2: then word is _ D N A _ 
We need letters for position 1 and 5? 

Words: ""adman""? But repeated A? And M? But ""adman"" is A D M A N? But we have A at position 4? So if we put: 
Position1: A? But then we have A at 1 and 4? But we don't know if repeated letters? But we have no evidence? But in the first guess, we had A at 3? And in the second guess, we had A at 2? And we got '-' both times? So if the word had two A's, we would have gotten an indication? But we didn't? So probably only one A? 

Similarly, we have only one N? 

So we assume no repeated letters? 

Therefore, we cannot have two A's? 

So ""adman"" is invalid? 

Other words: ""idna""? Not 5 letters? 
""udona""? Not common? 

Option 5: A at 4, D at 5: then word is _ _ N A D
We need letters for position 1 and 2? 

Words: ""gonad""? G,O,N,A,D? 
- G and O are new? 
- Avoids forbidden letters? 
- But position 3 is N? So G(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), D(5)? 
- A is at position 4? Which is allowed? 
- D is at position 5? Which is allowed? 
- And we have N at 3? 

So ""gonad"" is a word? Yes? 

But is it common? It might be? 

Other words: ""tonad""? Not common? 
""monad""? M,O,N,A,D? 
- M(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), D(5)? 

""monad"" is a valid word? 

Similarly, ""nomad""? But N is at position 1? But we need N at position 3? 

""nomad"" is N(1), O(2), M(3), A(4), D(5)? But we need position 3 to be N? So not? 

So only ""gonad"" and ""monad"" fit? 

Option 6: A at 5, D at 1: then word is D _ N _ A
We need letters for position 2 and 4? 

Words: ""diana""? But I,A? And A at the end? But then we have two A's? 
""donna""? Repeated N? 
""duena""? But E? 
Not good? 

Option 7: A at 5, D at 2: then word is _ D N _ A
We need letters for position 1 and 4? 

Words: ""udona""? Not common? 
""idna""? Not? 
""adnea""? Not? 

So the most promising is option 5: A at 4, D at 5? With words like ""gonad"" or ""monad""? 

But we also have the possibility of A at 1 and D at 2? But we couldn't find a common word? 

Another idea: what about ""dance""? But E? Forbidden? 

Or ""lance""? But C and E? 

We have to avoid E? 

Another word for option 1 (A at 1, D at 2): ""adobe""? But E? 
""admit""? A(1), D(2), M(3)? But position 3 must be N? So we cannot have M at 3? 

So we must have N at position 3? 

Therefore, the only words we have are ""gonad"" and ""monad""? 

But let's check if they are valid? 

""gonad"": G O N A D? 
- G: not tried? 
- O: not tried? 
- N: at position 3? 
- A: at position 4? 
- D: at position 5? 

And we know A can be at position 4? Because we haven't tried position 4 for A? And we know A is not at 2 or 3? 

Similarly, D at position 5? We know D is not at 4? But we don't know about position 5? 

Also, we avoid C,R,E,S,Y? 

""monad"": M O N A D? Same? 

Which one to choose? 

We can choose ""monad"" because M is more common? 

But we want to test more common letters? 

We have not tried T, L, I, O, U, etc? 

In ""monad"", we have M and O? 

In ""gonad"", G and O? 

M is more common than G? 

But we can also consider other options? 

What about A at position 5? 

For example, in option 7: A at 5, D at 2? We didn't find a word? 

But let's try: _ D N _ A? 

What about ""urban""? But R? 
""woman""? W,O,M,A,N? But N at position 5? But we need N at 3? 
""human""? H,U,M,A,N? N at 5? 

Not? 

Another idea: what if we put D at position 1 and A at position 5? Then word: D _ N _ A? 

Words: ""diana""? But I and A? And two A's? 
""donna""? Two N's? 
""duena""? E? 
""dacha""? But C? 

Not good? 

So back to ""monad"" or ""gonad"". 

I think ""monad"" is more common? 

But let's confirm: we have to have N at position 3? 

In ""monad"": 
M(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), D(5)? 

This satisfies:
- A is at position 4? Which is allowed? 
- D is at position 5? Which is allowed? 
- N at position 3? 
- No forbidden letters? 
- And we test M and O? 

Similarly, ""gonad"" is G(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), D(5)? 

But we might also consider ""nomad""? But ""nomad"" has N at position 1? Which we cannot do? Because we need N at position 3? 

So only ""monad"" and ""gonad""? 

I think ""monad"" is better? 

But we have to make sure that D at position 5 is allowed? We know D is in the word but not at position 4? So it can be at 5? 

Similarly, A at 4 is allowed? 

So I'll go with ""monad"". 

But let's see if there is a word with T? 

For example, if we try A at 1 and D at 2? And then T? But we couldn't find a word? 

What about ""adult""? But L,T? And U? But then: A(1), D(2), U(3)? But position 3 must be N? So not? 

""adopt""? O,P,T? But position 3 must be N? 

No? 

So I think ""monad"" is a reasonable choice? 

Therefore, we guess ""monad"". 

<guess>monad</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, here's the step-by-step reasoning for the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):**
   - C, R, E: Not in the word (x).
   - A: In the word but not in position 3 (-).
   - N: In the word but not in position 4 (-).
   - **Key deductions:** The secret word contains A and N, but not C, R, or E. A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4.

2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (""sandy""):**
   - S, Y: Not in the word (x).
   - A: In the word but not in position 2 (-). Combined with Guess 1, A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
   - N: Correct position (✓) at position 3.
   - D: In the word but not in position 4 (-).
   - **Key deductions:**
     - N is confirmed at position 3 (so the word pattern is `_ _ N _ _`).
     - A must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 2 or 3).
     - D is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
     - The word contains A, N, and D, and excludes C, R, E, S, Y.
     - No repeated letters (since feedback showed only one N and one A, and no indications of duplicates).

3. **Constraints for the next guess:**
   - Must include A and D (since they are in the word but positions unknown).
   - N must be at position 3.
   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.
   - D cannot be in position 4 → must be in 1, 2, or 5.
   - Avoid C, R, E, S, Y.
   - Use new letters to maximize information (e.g., test common unused letters like M, O, T, L, I).

4. **Generating possible guesses:**
   - The word pattern is `_ _ N _ _`.
   - A and D must be placed in valid positions without overlap. Possible combinations:
     - A in 1, D in 2: Words like `ADN__` (e.g., ""adnex"" invalid due to E/X).
     - A in 1, D in 5: Words like `A_N_D` (e.g., ""award"" invalid due to R).
     - A in 4, D in 1: Words like `D_N A_` (e.g., ""dinar"" invalid due to R).
     - A in 4, D in 2: Words like `_D N A_` (e.g., ""udona"" not common).
     - **A in 4, D in 5**: Words like `_ _ N A D` (e.g., ""gonad"" or ""monad"").
     - A in 5, D in 1: Words like `D_N_ A` (e.g., ""diana"" invalid due to repeated A).
     - A in 5, D in 2: Words like `_D N _ A` (e.g., ""idna"" invalid).
   - **Best option: A in position 4 and D in position 5** (`_ _ N A D`). This fits common words like ""monad"" or ""gonad"", which:
     - Place A and D in valid positions (A not in 2/3, D not in 4).
     - Include N at position 3.
     - Use new letters (M/O or G/O) to test more of the alphabet.
     - Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, E, S, Y).

5. **Choosing between ""monad"" and ""gonad"":**
   - Both are valid 5-letter words.
   - ""monad"" (M-O-N-A-D) is slightly more common and uses M (a high-frequency consonant) instead of G, providing better information if M is in/out of the word.
   - Testing M and O covers new ground, as only 8 letters have been tested so far (C, R, A, N, E, S, D, Y).

6. **Final decision:**
   - Guess ""monad"" to test:
     - Position 4: A (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we learn A must be in 1 or 5).
     - Position 5: D (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we learn D must be in 1 or 2).
     - Letters M and O (if absent, we rule them out; if present, we get position clues).

It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).\n\n So, our first guess will be: CRANE\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)\nThis means:\n- C is not in the secret word at all.\n- R is not in the secret word at all.\n- A is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 3).\n- N is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 4).\n- E is not in the secret word at all.\n\nImportant: The positions matter. In ""crane"":\n  Position 1: C -> not in word\n  Position 2: R -> not in word\n  Position 3: A -> present but wrong position\n  Position 4: N -> present but wrong position\n  Position 5: E -> not in word\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively. Also, it does not contain C, R, or E.\n\nWe must use this information to make a new guess. The new word must:\n1. Be a 5-letter English word.\n2. Include the letter A and N (since they are in the word), but not in positions 3 and 4?\n   - Actually, A cannot be at position 3 and N cannot be at position 4? Not exactly: The feedback says A is present but not at position 3, which doesn\'t prevent it from being elsewhere. Similarly for N, it is present but not at position 4, so it must be in one of the other positions (1,2,3,5) but note we have constraints from the previous guess.\n\nWait, let\'s clarify: the secret word must have A somewhere, but not at position 3? Actually, the feedback tells us that in our guess, the A that we put at position 3 is actually in the word, but not at that position. So in the secret word, A is at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, N is at position 1,2,3, or 5 (but not 4).\n\nAdditionally, the word must not contain C, R, or E.\n\nNow, we can think of common words that include A and N.\n\nWe also note that in the first guess, A was guessed at position 3 and N at position 4, but they are elsewhere. So let\'s try to place A and N in different positions.\n\nAlso, we want to test new letters because we have information about A and N. We might want to use other common letters to gain more information.\n\nCommon letters besides vowels: S, T, L, etc.\n\nBut note: we have used C, R, A, N, E. So avoid those except A and N.\n\nSo new letters to try: perhaps S, T, L, I, O, D, etc.\n\nLet me try to come up with a word that has:\n- A in position other than 3? Actually, we don\'t know where A is, so we can put it in any position except 3? Wait no: we know A is in the word, but not at position 3. So we can put A at a position we haven\'t tried (like 1,2,4,5) to test.\n\nSimilarly for N, we can put it at a position other than 4.\n\nBut note: we don\'t want to put both A and N in positions we already know they are not? Actually, we only know they are not in the positions we placed them in the first guess. But since we haven\'t tried other positions, we can try them.\n\nI think a good strategy would be to place A and N in new positions and include other common letters.\n\nLet us consider placing A in position 1 and N in position 2? Or maybe spread out.\n\nAlternatively, we can pick a word with A and N and avoid C,R,E and also avoid positions that we already know are wrong? Actually, we don\'t have direct information about other positions.\n\nBut note: we know that position 1 cannot be A? Because if A were at position 1, then in the first guess we didn\'t have A at position 1, but that doesn\'t prevent the secret word from having A at position 1. Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about position 1 because we guessed C there. We only know that C is not in the word and not at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, we know that position 2 must not have R? But R is not in the word at all.\n\nActually, we have:\n- The secret word does not have R at all, so position 2 must be another letter.\n\nSo let me summarize:\n- The word contains A and N, but not C, R, E.\n- The positions: \n   - Position 1: cannot be C (and not A? no, because we haven\'t tested A at position 1) -> actually, we don\'t know. We only know that C is not there and the letter is not C.\n   - Similarly, position 2: cannot be R, and the letter is not R.\n   - Position 3: cannot be A? Actually, the feedback says A is present but not at position 3? That is correct: so A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, position 4: N is in the word but not at position 4? And position 5 is not E.\n\nSo we must avoid having A at position 3 and N at position 4? Actually, in our next guess we can avoid placing A at position 3 and N at position 4? But we don\'t know whether they might be elsewhere. Actually, if we put A at position 3 again, then if it\'s not correct we\'ll get \'-\' again? Or if it is the correct position we get a ✓. But we know A is not at position 3 from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for position 3 was A(-) meaning A is in the word but not in this position. Therefore, A cannot be at position 3? Yes, that\'s fixed: the secret word does not have A at position 3. Similarly, it does not have N at position 4.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess we must avoid:\n- Putting A at position 3? Actually, we can put it anywhere we want to test. But we already know that position 3 is wrong for A? Yes. So we don\'t want to put A at position 3 again because we know it\'s not there. Similarly for N at position 4.\n\nSo the new guess should have A in one of the positions: 1,2,4,5 and N in one of the positions:1,2,3,5.\n\nMoreover, we don\'t want to reuse the letters that are definitely absent: C,R,E.\n\nTherefore, letters we can use: any letter except C,R,E. And we must include A and N.\n\nNow, we have to choose three more letters. We can choose common letters we haven\'t tried: such as S, T, L, I, O, D, M, B, etc.\n\nLet me try to construct a word:\nOptions:\n- We can try A at the start? Like ""A"" followed by ...\n- Or N at the end? \n\nBut we have to have both A and N.\n\nCommon words: how about ""sandy""? \n- Has S, A, N, D, Y. \n- A at position 2 -> which is allowed (not position 3)\n- N at position 3 -> allowed (because we don\'t know about position 3 for N? Actually, N can be at position 3? Yes, because previously it was at position 4 and not there, but position 3 hasn\'t been tested for N? Actually, we placed N at position 4 and got \'-\' meaning N is in the word but not at 4. So N could be at position 3? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s check if ""sandy"" meets the constraints:\n- Includes A and N? Yes.\n- A at position 2? That\'s okay because we know A isn\'t at position 3? And we don\'t know about position 2? So we can test it.\n- N at position 4? Wait no: in ""sandy"":\n  S (position1), A (position2), N (position3), D (position4), Y (position5)\nSo N is at position 3? Which is unconfirmed.\n\nBut we are going to get feedback: if N is at position 3, we get ✓. Otherwise, if N is in the word but not at 3, we get \'-\', and then we know N must be elsewhere (position 1,2,5).\n\nBut note: we also have to avoid C,R,E? Sandy has none of those. So that\'s okay.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""bland"", but then B and L are new. Also: A at position 3? Wait, we cannot place A at position 3? Because we already know A is not at position 3? So we must avoid position 3 for A? Yes, because we got \'-\' meaning it\'s not there. So if we put A at position 3 again, it would be incorrect? So we shouldn\'t do that.\n\nTherefore, ""bland"" would have A at position 3: which we know is not possible? Wait no: the secret word does not have A at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 in our guess, we would get \'-\' again? And that would be redundant? It wouldn\'t break the game, but it\'s inefficient because we already know A is not at position 3.\n\nTo avoid redundant information, we should not put A at position 3 and N at position 4. So we want to place A and N in new positions.\n\nIn ""sandy"":\n- A is at position 2? That\'s new? Previously A was at position 3? So now we test position 2? That\'s good.\n- N is at position 3? Previously N was at position 4? So now testing position 3? That\'s good? Yes, because we haven\'t tried N at position 3.\n\nOr is it? Actually, in the first guess we didn\'t have any letter at position 1,2,5? So we don\'t know about A or N at those positions? But in ""sandy"", we have:\nPosition1: S? We don\'t know.\nPosition2: A? We don\'t know? But we know A is in the word? So if it isn\'t at position 2? Then we get \'-\' for A? And then we know it must be at 1,4,5? \n\nThat\'s acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t place A and N adjacent? Or try to cover more common letters.\n\nAnother option: ""piano""? But that has P,I,A,N,O. And note: O is a vowel? But we haven\'t tried O? And E is missing? But we don\'t care? We are avoiding E? But note: words can have repeated letters? We are not sure? But we don\'t know? So let\'s assume no repeated letters? Unless we have evidence? \n\nThe game can have repeated letters? Actually, the rules don\'t say? But in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? So we cannot assume? But for now, we don\'t have any information? And ""piano"" has distinct letters? So that\'s good? Also, ""piano"" has A at position 3? Oh wait, we cannot put A at position 3? Because we know A isn\'t at position 3? So if we put ""piano"", then A would be at position 3? Which we know is wrong? So we shouldn\'t do that? Because we would get a \'-\' and we know that already? So it doesn\'t give new information? \n\nTherefore, avoid position 3 for A? So ""piano"" is bad.\n\nHow about ""adorn""? \n- A at position 1? New position? \n- D,O,R,N? Wait: R is not allowed? Because feedback said R is not in the word? So ""adorn"" contains R? Which is bad? We cannot use R? \n\nAnother word: ""train""? But has R? And T,R,A,I,N? R again? Not allowed? \n\nWe need words without R and without C and E? \n\nHow about ""saint""? \n- S,A,I,N,T? \n- A at position 2? Which is okay? \n- N at position 4? Wait: we know from the first guess that N is not at position 4? So if we put N at position 4? We would get a \'-\'? Meaning that if the secret word has N elsewhere? So we will learn that N isn\'t at position 4? But we already know that? So redundant? \n\nWe should avoid putting N at position 4? Because we know it\'s not there? \n\nTherefore, in our next guess we must avoid:\n- Position 3 for A? Because we know A isn\'t at position 3? So in the new word, A should be at 1,2,4, or 5? \n- Position 4 for N? So N should be at 1,2,3, or 5? \n\nTherefore, ""saint"" is bad? Because it has N at position 4? \n\nHow about ""stain""? \n- S,T,A,I,N? \n- A at position 3? Oh again? We cannot put A at position 3? \n\nWait, let me write:\nstain: s (1), t (2), a (3), i (4), n (5)? \nSo A at position 3? Which is what we must avoid? \n\nHow about ""stank""? \n- S,T,A,N,K? \n- A at position 3? Still bad? \n\nWe want words where A is not at position 3? \n\nHow about ""snail""? \n- S at 1, N at 2? That\'s allowed for N? We don\'t know about N at position 2? \n- A at position 3? Again? Bad? \n\nWe might shift? How about ""lacks""? But then C is in it? We know C is not in the word? So ""lacks"" uses C? Forbidden? \n\nLet me think: A at position 1? Like ""ankle""? But E at the end? We know E is not in the word? So not allowed? \n\nHow about ""aloud""? \n- A,L,O,U,D? \n- Does not include N? We must include N? Because the feedback says N is in the word? \n\nWe must include both A and N? Because the feedback indicates they are in the word? \n\nSo the word must contain A and N? \n\nTherefore, ""aloud"" is missing N? So invalid? \n\nHow about ""brand""? But has R? And B,R,A,N,D? R is forbidden? \n\nWe need words without C,R,E and with A and N? \n\nAnd positioning: \nWe want to test A in a new position? Maybe position 1? \n\nFor example, ""angel""? But E is there? And G,L? But E is forbidden? \n\n""angst""? \n- A,N,G,S,T? \n- A at position 1? That\'s good? \n- N at position 2? Which is new? \nBut note: does it have any forbidden letters? Forbidden: C,R,E? None? So ""angst"" is A, N, G, S, T? And we can use it? \n\nBut what about positions? \n- A at 1: we think it might be? \n- N at 2: we don\'t know? \n\nBut note: we also must consider that in the first guess, position 4 had an N? And we said it wasn\'t there? So we are avoiding position 4? In this case, N is at position 2? So that\'s okay? \n\nAlso, A at position 1? Previously, we had a letter at position 1? It was C? Which is not in the word? So we don\'t know what is at position 1? \n\nSo ""angst"" seems valid? \n\nBut are there any other constraints? \n\nWe can also try ""sandy"", but we rejected because N is at position 3? In ""sandy"": \nPosition1: S?\nPosition2: A?\nPosition3: N?\nPosition4: D?\nPosition5: Y? \n\nWe must avoid placing A at position 3? Which we are? So that\'s okay? \nBut N is at position 3? And we don\'t know? \n\nBut we also note that position 4 must not be N? Which we know? And ""sandy"" doesn\'t have N at 4? So safe? \n\nBut we also know that position 4 in the secret word? We don\'t know? So we will get feedback? \n\nThe problem: if we put N at position 3? Then if the secret word has N at position 3? We get ✓? Otherwise, we get \'-\'? And it tells us that N is at another position? \n\nSimilarly, A at position 2? \n\nNow, compare between ""angst"" and ""sandy""? \n\nIn ""angst"", we test position 1 for A? If it is not A? We get \'-\'? But we know A is in the word? So then we know A must be at 2,4,5? But we didn\'t test those? \n\nIn ""sandy"", we test A at position 2? \n\nAnother option: ""mind at""? But we need a single word? \n\nPerhaps ""hands""? But H,A,N,D,S? \n- Letter H? And avoids C,R,E? \n- A at position 2? \n- N at position 3? \n\nBut note: ""hands"" has two of the same? No? Distinct? \nBut position: A at 2? N at 3? \n\nAlso, we have a new letter H? So that\'s good? \n\nBut ""hands"" includes S? Which is common? \n\nWait, we are going for breadth? To cover more letters? \n\nBut note: ""angst"" has S,T,G? ""hands"" has D,S,H? \n\nPerhaps a word with more common consonants? \n\nHow about ""talon""? But O? And L? \nBut T and L? Also, ""talon"" has O? \nWe can do? But ""talon"" is T,A,L,O,N? \nWhich has A at position 2? And N at position 5? \nAnd avoids C,R,E? \nAlso, T and L are commonly used? \n\nBut note the feedback: we got A and N in the word, and we are using two new vowels: O? But vowels are important? And we have used A already? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested vowels? E is not in the word? But we don\'t know about I and O? \n\nSo ""talon"" might be good? \n\nBut I think we need to pick one? \n\nAlternatively, ""plant""? But then R is in ""plant""? No: P,L,A,N,T? \nActually, ""plant"" has L,A,N,P,T? \n- Without R? Oh: ""plant"" is P,L,A,N,T? \nWait: P,L,A,N,T? \nThat has no R? So it\'s okay? \nBut we must avoid? \n- A at position 3? Bad? \n\nLet me spell: \nplant: P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) => A at position 3? We cannot have that? \n\nBut if we use ""plant"", we are putting A at position 3? Which we know is wrong? \n\nTherefore, we must choose a word where A is not at position 3? \n\nSo after reconsidering? We need A at 1,2,4,5? \n\nSo back to ""angst"": A at position 1? \nOr ""sandy"": A at position 2? \nOr ""handy"": H,A,N,D,Y? Then: \n- H(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> A at 2? N at 3? \nAnd avoids position 3? We didn\'t put A at 3? So that is okay? \n\nAlso, ""handy"" has no C,R,E? \n\nAlternatively, ""tango"": T,A,N,G,O? \n- T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) \n\nA at position 2? N at position 3? \n\nBut wait: position 4 is N in previous? But now we have N at position 3? \n\nAny of these? \n\nI think ""sandy"" is acceptable? Or ""tangy""? Same? \n\nLet me choose ""tangy"": \nT,A,N,G,Y? \nPositions: T(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5)\n\nAnd the word is valid? Yes? \n\nBut to be systematic, we want to test as many as possible not yet tried letters? \n\nSince we know C,R,E and E are missing? There are many letters left? S,T,L, etc. \n\nSo ""tangy"" uses T,A,N,G,Y? So new letters: T,G,Y? \n\nWe haven\'t tried T,G,Y before? \n\nSimilarly, ""sandy"" uses S,A,N,D,Y? New letters: S,D,Y? \n\nBoth are good? \n\nI don\'t have a strong preference? \n\nAnother common start: when we have A and N, how about ""snail""? But A would be at position 3? Which is not allowed? \n\nSo we choose ""handy"" to include H? \n\nBut let\'s pick ""sandy"": \n\nWe guessed ""crane"" first? Then ""sandy"" second? \n\nLet\'s decide: \n<guess>sandy</guess> \n\nBut note: we are allowed only common words? And ""sandy"" is common? \n\nYes? \n\nSo I\'ll go with that? \n\nTherefore, second guess: sandyAfter the first guess ""crane"" with feedback:\n- C (x): C is not in the secret word.\n- R (x): R is not in the secret word.\n- A (-): A is in the word but not in position 3.\n- N (-): N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E (x): E is not in the secret word.\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word contains A and N, but not C, R, or E.\n- A must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (it cannot be in position 3).\n- N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (it cannot be in position 4).\n- The new guess must include A and N while avoiding C, R, E.\n\nI selected ""sandy"" as the next guess because:\n- It includes A (position 2) and N (position 3), both in new positions not previously tested for these letters.\n- It introduces S, D, and Y, which are common letters not yet ruled out.\n- The word adheres to the constraints: A is not in position 3, N is not in position 4, and it avoids C, R, E.\n- This guess maximizes feedback potential by testing new positions for known letters and adding three new letters.\n\n<guess>sandy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: sandy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) N(✓) D(-) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: not in word (x)\n- R: not in word (x)\n- A: in word but wrong position (-) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3\n- N: in word but wrong position (-) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 4\n- E: not in word (x)\n\nGuess 2: ""sandy""\n- S: not in word (x)\n- A: in word but wrong position (-) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 2 (and we already know not at 3)\n- N: correct position (✓) -> so N is at position 3\n- D: in word but wrong position (-) -> so D is in the word, but not at position 4\n- Y: not in word (x)\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. The secret word contains: A, N, and D (because we have - for A and D, meaning they are present, and ✓ for N meaning it\'s present and at position 3).\n2. The secret word does not contain: C, R, E, S, Y (all marked x).\n3. Position 3 is N (from the second guess, we have N at position 3 is correct).\n\nAdditionally, we know:\n- A is in the word but not at position 2 (from ""sandy"") and not at position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be at position 1, 4, or 5.\n- D is in the word but not at position 4 (from ""sandy""). So D must be at position 1, 2, or 5 (but note position 3 is taken by N, so D cannot be there).\n\nAlso, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, D, Y. So we should avoid these except A, N, D which are in the word.\n\nWe need to form a new 5-letter word that:\n- Has N at position 3.\n- Includes A and D (and N, which is fixed at position 3).\n- A is at position 1, 4, or 5.\n- D is at position 1, 2, or 5 (but not 4, and not 3 because that\'s N).\n- Avoids C, R, E, S, Y.\n\nWe also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think of possible words:\n\nFirst, since N is fixed at position 3, the word is: _ _ N _ _\n\nNow, we need to place A and D in the remaining positions: 1,2,4,5, but with constraints.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1,4,5\nPossible positions for D: 1,2,5 (but note: if we put D at 5, then A cannot be at 5? Actually, they can be at the same position? No, because each position has one letter. So we have to assign distinct positions.\n\nSo the positions for A and D must be two distinct positions from {1,2,4,5}, but with:\n- A in {1,4,5}\n- D in {1,2,5}\n\nSo the possible pairs of positions for (A, D) could be:\n- A at 1, D at 2 -> then positions 4 and 5 are new letters.\n- A at 1, D at 5 -> then positions 2 and 4 are new letters.\n- A at 4, D at 1 -> then positions 2 and 5 are new letters.\n- A at 4, D at 2 -> then positions 1 and 5 are new letters.\n- A at 4, D at 5 -> then positions 1 and 2 are new letters.\n- A at 5, D at 1 -> then positions 2 and 4 are new letters.\n- A at 5, D at 2 -> then positions 1 and 4 are new letters.\n\nBut note: we cannot have A and D both at position 5? So we have to choose different positions.\n\nWe also have to fill the remaining two positions with letters that are not C,R,E,S,Y and not A,N,D (but A and D are already placed, so the new letters must be other letters).\n\nWe should choose a word that uses common letters we haven\'t tried: for example, T, L, I, O, U, M, B, G, etc.\n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nOption 1: A at position 1, D at position 2: then word starts with A D N _ _\nWe need two more letters. Possible words: ADMIN? But M and I? But we haven\'t tried M and I? But note: ADMIN has I? And we don\'t know about I? But also, we have to avoid S,Y? ADMIN is a word? ADMIN is 5 letters? A-D-M-I-N? But we have N at position 3? So A D M I N? That would be: \nPosition1: A\nPosition2: D\nPosition3: N? But we have D at position 2? Then position3 is N? Then position4: I? Position5: N? Wait, that\'s two N\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has repeated letters? But in this case, we have N at position 3 and 5? But the feedback for ""sandy"" had N at position 3 correct? So if the word has two N\'s? Then we would have known? But in ""sandy"", we only had one N? And it was at position 3? And we got N(✓) and no other N? So if the secret word had two N\'s, then in ""sandy"" we would have gotten an indication for the second N? But we didn\'t? Because the feedback only showed one N? So the secret word has exactly one N? Because if it had two, then when we guessed ""sandy"" with one N at position 3, we would have gotten a \'-\' for the other N if it was in the word? But we didn\'t? So the secret word has only one N? \n\nTherefore, we can assume no repeated letters? Because we have no evidence of repetition? So we avoid words with repeated letters? \n\nSo ADMIN is invalid because it would require two N\'s? Actually, ADMIN is A-D-M-I-N, so only one N? But in this case, if we put A at 1, D at 2, then we have to fill positions 4 and 5? So the word would be A D N ? ? \n\nWe need a word that starts with ADN? Then what? Like ""adnex""? But E is forbidden? And X? Not common? \n\n""adnoun""? Too long? \n\nNot many words start with ADN? \n\nSo maybe not a good option? \n\nOption 2: A at 1, D at 5: then word is A _ N _ D\nWe need letters for position 2 and 4? \n\nCommon words: ""award""? But R is forbidden? \n\n""avoid""? But O and I? And D at the end? But we have D at position 5? And A at 1? Then V? I? But we haven\'t tried V and I? \n\nBut ""avoid"" is A(1), V(2), O(3)? But position 3 is N? So we cannot put O at 3? \n\nThe word must have N at position 3? So we have A _ N _ D? \n\nSo the third letter is fixed as N? \n\nSo we need a word: A ? N ? D? \n\nExamples: \n- ""aunty""? But U,N,T,Y? But Y is forbidden? \n- ""ante""? But E? \n- ""and""? Too short? \n- ""amend""? But E? \n- ""aloud""? But L,O,U? And D at the end? But then: A(1), L(2), O(3)? But position 3 must be N? So we cannot have O at 3? \n\nSo we need the third letter to be N? \n\nSo the word is: A (letter2) N (letter4) D? \n\nWhat words? ""bandy""? But B,A,N,D,Y? But Y is forbidden? And we have A at 1? So ""bandy"" is B at 1? \n\nWe need A at 1? So ""a"" at the beginning? \n\n""anode""? But E? \n""anvil""? A(1), N(2)? But we need N at 3? \n""angry""? But R and Y? \n""antic""? But C? \n\nNot many? \n\nOption 3: A at 4, D at 1: then word is D _ N A _ \nWe need letters for position 2 and 5? \n\nWords: ""dinar""? But R? \n""donna""? But repeated N? And we don\'t want repeated letters? \n""dunam""? Not common? \n""denay""? But E and Y? \n\nNot good? \n\nOption 4: A at 4, D at 2: then word is _ D N A _ \nWe need letters for position 1 and 5? \n\nWords: ""adman""? But repeated A? And M? But ""adman"" is A D M A N? But we have A at position 4? So if we put: \nPosition1: A? But then we have A at 1 and 4? But we don\'t know if repeated letters? But we have no evidence? But in the first guess, we had A at 3? And in the second guess, we had A at 2? And we got \'-\' both times? So if the word had two A\'s, we would have gotten an indication? But we didn\'t? So probably only one A? \n\nSimilarly, we have only one N? \n\nSo we assume no repeated letters? \n\nTherefore, we cannot have two A\'s? \n\nSo ""adman"" is invalid? \n\nOther words: ""idna""? Not 5 letters? \n""udona""? Not common? \n\nOption 5: A at 4, D at 5: then word is _ _ N A D\nWe need letters for position 1 and 2? \n\nWords: ""gonad""? G,O,N,A,D? \n- G and O are new? \n- Avoids forbidden letters? \n- But position 3 is N? So G(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), D(5)? \n- A is at position 4? Which is allowed? \n- D is at position 5? Which is allowed? \n- And we have N at 3? \n\nSo ""gonad"" is a word? Yes? \n\nBut is it common? It might be? \n\nOther words: ""tonad""? Not common? \n""monad""? M,O,N,A,D? \n- M(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), D(5)? \n\n""monad"" is a valid word? \n\nSimilarly, ""nomad""? But N is at position 1? But we need N at position 3? \n\n""nomad"" is N(1), O(2), M(3), A(4), D(5)? But we need position 3 to be N? So not? \n\nSo only ""gonad"" and ""monad"" fit? \n\nOption 6: A at 5, D at 1: then word is D _ N _ A\nWe need letters for position 2 and 4? \n\nWords: ""diana""? But I,A? And A at the end? But then we have two A\'s? \n""donna""? Repeated N? \n""duena""? But E? \nNot good? \n\nOption 7: A at 5, D at 2: then word is _ D N _ A\nWe need letters for position 1 and 4? \n\nWords: ""udona""? Not common? \n""idna""? Not? \n""adnea""? Not? \n\nSo the most promising is option 5: A at 4, D at 5? With words like ""gonad"" or ""monad""? \n\nBut we also have the possibility of A at 1 and D at 2? But we couldn\'t find a common word? \n\nAnother idea: what about ""dance""? But E? Forbidden? \n\nOr ""lance""? But C and E? \n\nWe have to avoid E? \n\nAnother word for option 1 (A at 1, D at 2): ""adobe""? But E? \n""admit""? A(1), D(2), M(3)? But position 3 must be N? So we cannot have M at 3? \n\nSo we must have N at position 3? \n\nTherefore, the only words we have are ""gonad"" and ""monad""? \n\nBut let\'s check if they are valid? \n\n""gonad"": G O N A D? \n- G: not tried? \n- O: not tried? \n- N: at position 3? \n- A: at position 4? \n- D: at position 5? \n\nAnd we know A can be at position 4? Because we haven\'t tried position 4 for A? And we know A is not at 2 or 3? \n\nSimilarly, D at position 5? We know D is not at 4? But we don\'t know about position 5? \n\nAlso, we avoid C,R,E,S,Y? \n\n""monad"": M O N A D? Same? \n\nWhich one to choose? \n\nWe can choose ""monad"" because M is more common? \n\nBut we want to test more common letters? \n\nWe have not tried T, L, I, O, U, etc? \n\nIn ""monad"", we have M and O? \n\nIn ""gonad"", G and O? \n\nM is more common than G? \n\nBut we can also consider other options? \n\nWhat about A at position 5? \n\nFor example, in option 7: A at 5, D at 2? We didn\'t find a word? \n\nBut let\'s try: _ D N _ A? \n\nWhat about ""urban""? But R? \n""woman""? W,O,M,A,N? But N at position 5? But we need N at 3? \n""human""? H,U,M,A,N? N at 5? \n\nNot? \n\nAnother idea: what if we put D at position 1 and A at position 5? Then word: D _ N _ A? \n\nWords: ""diana""? But I and A? And two A\'s? \n""donna""? Two N\'s? \n""duena""? E? \n""dacha""? But C? \n\nNot good? \n\nSo back to ""monad"" or ""gonad"". \n\nI think ""monad"" is more common? \n\nBut let\'s confirm: we have to have N at position 3? \n\nIn ""monad"": \nM(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), D(5)? \n\nThis satisfies:\n- A is at position 4? Which is allowed? \n- D is at position 5? Which is allowed? \n- N at position 3? \n- No forbidden letters? \n- And we test M and O? \n\nSimilarly, ""gonad"" is G(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), D(5)? \n\nBut we might also consider ""nomad""? But ""nomad"" has N at position 1? Which we cannot do? Because we need N at position 3? \n\nSo only ""monad"" and ""gonad""? \n\nI think ""monad"" is better? \n\nBut we have to make sure that D at position 5 is allowed? We know D is in the word but not at position 4? So it can be at 5? \n\nSimilarly, A at 4 is allowed? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""monad"". \n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with T? \n\nFor example, if we try A at 1 and D at 2? And then T? But we couldn\'t find a word? \n\nWhat about ""adult""? But L,T? And U? But then: A(1), D(2), U(3)? But position 3 must be N? So not? \n\n""adopt""? O,P,T? But position 3 must be N? \n\nNo? \n\nSo I think ""monad"" is a reasonable choice? \n\nTherefore, we guess ""monad"". \n\n<guess>monad</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, here\'s the step-by-step reasoning for the next guess:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):**\n   - C, R, E: Not in the word (x).\n   - A: In the word but not in position 3 (-).\n   - N: In the word but not in position 4 (-).\n   - **Key deductions:** The secret word contains A and N, but not C, R, or E. A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4.\n\n2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (""sandy""):**\n   - S, Y: Not in the word (x).\n   - A: In the word but not in position 2 (-). Combined with Guess 1, A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.\n   - N: Correct position (✓) at position 3.\n   - D: In the word but not in position 4 (-).\n   - **Key deductions:**\n     - N is confirmed at position 3 (so the word pattern is `_ _ N _ _`).\n     - A must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (since it can\'t be in 2 or 3).\n     - D is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5.\n     - The word contains A, N, and D, and excludes C, R, E, S, Y.\n     - No repeated letters (since feedback showed only one N and one A, and no indications of duplicates).\n\n3. **Constraints for the next guess:**\n   - Must include A and D (since they are in the word but positions unknown).\n   - N must be at position 3.\n   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.\n   - D cannot be in position 4 → must be in 1, 2, or 5.\n   - Avoid C, R, E, S, Y.\n   - Use new letters to maximize information (e.g., test common unused letters like M, O, T, L, I).\n\n4. **Generating possible guesses:**\n   - The word pattern is `_ _ N _ _`.\n   - A and D must be placed in valid positions without overlap. Possible combinations:\n     - A in 1, D in 2: Words like `ADN__` (e.g., ""adnex"" invalid due to E/X).\n     - A in 1, D in 5: Words like `A_N_D` (e.g., ""award"" invalid due to R).\n     - A in 4, D in 1: Words like `D_N A_` (e.g., ""dinar"" invalid due to R).\n     - A in 4, D in 2: Words like `_D N A_` (e.g., ""udona"" not common).\n     - **A in 4, D in 5**: Words like `_ _ N A D` (e.g., ""gonad"" or ""monad"").\n     - A in 5, D in 1: Words like `D_N_ A` (e.g., ""diana"" invalid due to repeated A).\n     - A in 5, D in 2: Words like `_D N _ A` (e.g., ""idna"" invalid).\n   - **Best option: A in position 4 and D in position 5** (`_ _ N A D`). This fits common words like ""monad"" or ""gonad"", which:\n     - Place A and D in valid positions (A not in 2/3, D not in 4).\n     - Include N at position 3.\n     - Use new letters (M/O or G/O) to test more of the alphabet.\n     - Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, E, S, Y).\n\n5. **Choosing between ""monad"" and ""gonad"":**\n   - Both are valid 5-letter words.\n   - ""monad"" (M-O-N-A-D) is slightly more common and uses M (a high-frequency consonant) instead of G, providing better information if M is in/out of the word.\n   - Testing M and O covers new ground, as only 8 letters have been tested so far (C, R, A, N, E, S, D, Y).\n\n6. **Final decision:**\n   - Guess ""monad"" to test:\n     - Position 4: A (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we learn A must be in 1 or 5).\n     - Position 5: D (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we learn D must be in 1 or 2).\n     - Letters M and O (if absent, we rule them out; if present, we get position clues).\n\n<guess>monad</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: sandy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) N(✓) D(-) Y(x)\nGuess 3: monad -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) N(✓) A(✓) D(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x): So A and N are in the word, but A not at pos 3, N not at pos 4.

Guess 2: ""sandy""
- S(x), A(-), N(✓), D(-), Y(x): So N is at position 3 (confirmed). A is in the word but not at pos 2. D is in the word but not at pos 4.

Guess 3: ""monad""
- M(x), O(✓), N(✓), A(✓), D(✓): This means O is at position 2 (since we guessed O at position 2 and got ✓). Similarly, N at 3 is correct, A at 4 is correct, D at 5 is correct.

Therefore, from the third guess, we know:
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: D

And M is not in the word (so we can rule out M).

Now, we have four positions fixed: 
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: D

So the word is: _ O N A D

We only need to determine the first letter.

Now, constraints from previous feedback:
- The letter must not be C, R, E, S, Y, M (all marked x in previous feedback).
- Also, from the first guess, we know A and N are in the word, but we already have them in positions 4 and 3. So no issue.
- We also don't have any indication of repeated letters? But the first letter cannot be O, N, A, or D? Because we only have one O, one N, one A, one D? So it must be a new letter? And we don't know about the first letter? 

But note: in the first guess, we have A(-) meaning A is somewhere? And in the third guess, we have A at position 4? So that's consistent? Similarly for N? 

But we haven't tested the first position? 

We know the first letter must be a letter not ruled out? 

Letters ruled out: C, R, E, S, Y, M (and the letters we have: O, N, A, D are in the word? But they are already placed). 

So the first letter must be a letter we haven't tried? And not any of the ruled-out letters? 

What letters have been tried? 
- From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E
- From ""sandy"": S, A, N, D, Y
- From ""monad"": M, O, N, A, D

So unique letters tried: C, R, A, N, E, S, D, Y, M, O

But A, N, D, O are in the word? So ruled out: C, R, E, S, Y, M

Therefore, the first letter must be one of the remaining letters? 

But we must consider that it must form a valid English word? 

So what words end with ""ONAD""? Actually, the pattern is _ONAD? 

What words fit? 

Common words: 
- ""tonad""? Not really? 
- ""gonad""? Well, we tried ""gonad"" ... but we didn't, we tried ""monad"". ""gonad"" is possible? But we ruled out M? And G hasn't been tried? 

But we have to avoid ruled out letters? 

So possible first letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (and more? but must be valid English words? 

But let's see: 
- ""tonad""? Not a common word? 
- ""gonad"": G is not ruled out? And it is a word? 
- ""nonad""? But that would have two N's? But we have N at position 3? And if we put N at position 1? Then we have N,O,N,A,D? So two N's? Did we have evidence of two N's? 

In guess 2: ""sandy"" had one N at position 3? And it showed N(✓)? If there was another N, then the game would show only for the correct one? Actually, the feedback shows only for the letters guessed? But if the word has two N's? And you guess one? Then if it is in the correct position? That position shows ✓? And the other N? Since you didn't guess it? You don't know? 

But in guess 1: ""crane"" had N at position 4? We got N(-)? Meaning the secret word has N? But if there are two N's? Then one was found? 

However, we haven't tested for repetition? So it is possible? 

But let's look at the feedback? 

In guess 3: ""monad"" gave O(✓), N(✓), A(✓), D(✓)? And M(x)? That covered all? 

But if the secret word had two N's? We don't know? 

Similarly? 

But the word pattern is _ONAD? 

With the given feedback? We can try to see? 

But we cannot be sure? 

Given that we have four positions correct? We only need to find the first letter? 

So let's find words? 

Common words: 
- ""gonad"": G O N A D? 
- ""tonal""? But then it ends with L? We need ...AD? 

Actually, the word must be _ O N A D? 

What English words have this pattern? 

- ""gonad"" is one? 
- ""nonad""? If we allow two N's? But is it a word? Nonad? In chemistry? Rare? 
- ""donad""? Not common? 
- ""monad"" we tried? 
- ""bynad""? Not? 

But ""gonad"" seems the most common? 

But note: we already tried ""monad""? And it gave O(✓) N(✓) A(✓) D(✓)? So the only letter wrong was M? 

So if the word were ""gonad"", then the feedback for ""monad"" would be: 
- M: x (secret word starts with G, not M)
- O: ✓? Because O is in position 2? 
- N: ✓? 
- A: ✓? 
- D: ✓? 

Which matches? 

Therefore, the word could be ""gonad"". 

But are there others? 

Another word: ""votad""? Not valid? 
""zonad""? Not? 
""honda""? But then it's H O N D A? Which does not match? Because position 4 is D? But we have position 4 as A? And position 5 as D? 

Our pattern: position 1: ? , position 2: O, position3: N, position4: A, position5: D? 

So the word must end with ONAD? 

In English, this is uncommon? But ""gonad"" is the primary example? 

There's also ""donad""? No? 

We can also consider that we have not tried G? And it is a valid letter? 

So we should guess ""gonad""? 

But let's check if it conflicts? 

We know the first letter is not M? So ""gonad"" is possible? 

Also, from the first guess: we had A at position 3? But ""gonad"" has A at position 4? So A is not at position 3? So consistent? 

Similarly, second guess: ""sandy"" had A at position 2? But ""gonad"" has A at position 4? So A is not at position 2? So consistent? 

Also, D: in guess 2, D was at position 4? But we got D(-)? So D should not be at position 4? And in ""gonad"", D is at position 5? So that's fine? 

Therefore, we guess ""gonad""? 

But note: we are making our fourth guess? And we have two possibilities? Or one? We think ""gonad"" is the only common word? 

So we go with that? 

Therefore, the guess is ""gonad"". 

But let's confirm the letters: 
- G: not tried? 
- O: we know is in the word? But at position 2? So we are not competing? 
- N, A, D: already confirmed? 

So <guess>gonad</guess>

However, if the word is ""gonad"", then we will get all ✓? 

But if not, then we have to reconsider? 

But given the information, ""gonad"" is the most likely? 

Are there any other words? 

Another idea: ""konad""? Not a word? 
""ponad""? Not English? 
""wonad""? Not? 

So I think ""gonad"" is the best bet? 

But note: the wordle dictionary? We don't know? But we assume ""gonad"" is acceptable? 

Therefore, we guess that? 

But to be safe, let's see the feedback? 

We have: 
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: D

And the first letter must be one that hasn't been tried and not ruled out? 

G hasn't been tried? And rules out letters are C,R,E,S,Y,M? 

Yes? 

So go ahead? 

So <guess>gonad</guess>
</think>
### Thought Process:
- **Feedback Recap**:
  - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A and N are in the word but not at positions 3 and 4. C, R, E are absent.
  - **Guess 2 (""sandy"")**: N is confirmed at position 3 (✓). A is in the word but not at position 2 (-). D is in the word but not at position 4 (-). S and Y are absent.
  - **Guess 3 (""monad"")**: Confirms O at position 2 (✓), N at position 3 (✓), A at position 4 (✓), and D at position 5 (✓). M is absent (x).

- **Deductions**:
  - Positions 2–5 are confirmed: **O** (pos2), **N** (pos3), **A** (pos4), **D** (pos5).  
    → The word must be `_ONAD`.
  - Only position 1 is unknown.
  - Absent letters so far: **C, R, E, S, Y, M** (all marked ""x"").
  - The missing letter must be:
    - A **new letter** not yet guessed (C, R, A, N, E, S, D, Y, M, O have been tested).
    - Not one of the absent letters listed above.
  - Possible candidates: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.
  - The guess must form a valid English word ending in `ONAD`.

- **Word Selection**:
  - Common English words fitting `_ONAD`:
    - **""gonad""** (valid term in biology).
    - Other combinations like ""tonad"", ""nonad"", etc., are rare or invalid.
  - ""gonad"" uses **G** (untested letter), and avoids all absent/used letters.
  - Given the pattern, ""gonad"" is the only feasible common word.

- **Conclusion**:  
  Guess ""gonad"" to test position 1. If correct, G must be in position 1; if incorrect, we know to retry other options (e.g., with B, T, etc.).

<guess>gonad</guess>",gonad,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x): So A and N are in the word, but A not at pos 3, N not at pos 4.

Guess 2: ""sandy""
- S(x), A(-), N(✓), D(-), Y(x): So N is at position 3 (confirmed). A is in the word but not at pos 2. D is in the word but not at pos 4.

Guess 3: ""monad""
- M(x), O(✓), N(✓), A(✓), D(✓): This means O is at position 2 (since we guessed O at position 2 and got ✓). Similarly, N at 3 is correct, A at 4 is correct, D at 5 is correct.

Therefore, from the third guess, we know:
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: D

And M is not in the word (so we can rule out M).

Now, we have four positions fixed: 
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: D

So the word is: _ O N A D

We only need to determine the first letter.

Now, constraints from previous feedback:
- The letter must not be C, R, E, S, Y, M (all marked x in previous feedback).
- Also, from the first guess, we know A and N are in the word, but we already have them in positions 4 and 3. So no issue.
- We also don't have any indication of repeated letters? But the first letter cannot be O, N, A, or D? Because we only have one O, one N, one A, one D? So it must be a new letter? And we don't know about the first letter? 

But note: in the first guess, we have A(-) meaning A is somewhere? And in the third guess, we have A at position 4? So that's consistent? Similarly for N? 

But we haven't tested the first position? 

We know the first letter must be a letter not ruled out? 

Letters ruled out: C, R, E, S, Y, M (and the letters we have: O, N, A, D are in the word? But they are already placed). 

So the first letter must be a letter we haven't tried? And not any of the ruled-out letters? 

What letters have been tried? 
- From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E
- From ""sandy"": S, A, N, D, Y
- From ""monad"": M, O, N, A, D

So unique letters tried: C, R, A, N, E, S, D, Y, M, O

But A, N, D, O are in the word? So ruled out: C, R, E, S, Y, M

Therefore, the first letter must be one of the remaining letters? 

But we must consider that it must form a valid English word? 

So what words end with ""ONAD""? Actually, the pattern is _ONAD? 

What words fit? 

Common words: 
- ""tonad""? Not really? 
- ""gonad""? Well, we tried ""gonad"" ... but we didn't, we tried ""monad"". ""gonad"" is possible? But we ruled out M? And G hasn't been tried? 

But we have to avoid ruled out letters? 

So possible first letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (and more? but must be valid English words? 

But let's see: 
- ""tonad""? Not a common word? 
- ""gonad"": G is not ruled out? And it is a word? 
- ""nonad""? But that would have two N's? But we have N at position 3? And if we put N at position 1? Then we have N,O,N,A,D? So two N's? Did we have evidence of two N's? 

In guess 2: ""sandy"" had one N at position 3? And it showed N(✓)? If there was another N, then the game would show only for the correct one? Actually, the feedback shows only for the letters guessed? But if the word has two N's? And you guess one? Then if it is in the correct position? That position shows ✓? And the other N? Since you didn't guess it? You don't know? 

But in guess 1: ""crane"" had N at position 4? We got N(-)? Meaning the secret word has N? But if there are two N's? Then one was found? 

However, we haven't tested for repetition? So it is possible? 

But let's look at the feedback? 

In guess 3: ""monad"" gave O(✓), N(✓), A(✓), D(✓)? And M(x)? That covered all? 

But if the secret word had two N's? We don't know? 

Similarly? 

But the word pattern is _ONAD? 

With the given feedback? We can try to see? 

But we cannot be sure? 

Given that we have four positions correct? We only need to find the first letter? 

So let's find words? 

Common words: 
- ""gonad"": G O N A D? 
- ""tonal""? But then it ends with L? We need ...AD? 

Actually, the word must be _ O N A D? 

What English words have this pattern? 

- ""gonad"" is one? 
- ""nonad""? If we allow two N's? But is it a word? Nonad? In chemistry? Rare? 
- ""donad""? Not common? 
- ""monad"" we tried? 
- ""bynad""? Not? 

But ""gonad"" seems the most common? 

But note: we already tried ""monad""? And it gave O(✓) N(✓) A(✓) D(✓)? So the only letter wrong was M? 

So if the word were ""gonad"", then the feedback for ""monad"" would be: 
- M: x (secret word starts with G, not M)
- O: ✓? Because O is in position 2? 
- N: ✓? 
- A: ✓? 
- D: ✓? 

Which matches? 

Therefore, the word could be ""gonad"". 

But are there others? 

Another word: ""votad""? Not valid? 
""zonad""? Not? 
""honda""? But then it's H O N D A? Which does not match? Because position 4 is D? But we have position 4 as A? And position 5 as D? 

Our pattern: position 1: ? , position 2: O, position3: N, position4: A, position5: D? 

So the word must end with ONAD? 

In English, this is uncommon? But ""gonad"" is the primary example? 

There's also ""donad""? No? 

We can also consider that we have not tried G? And it is a valid letter? 

So we should guess ""gonad""? 

But let's check if it conflicts? 

We know the first letter is not M? So ""gonad"" is possible? 

Also, from the first guess: we had A at position 3? But ""gonad"" has A at position 4? So A is not at position 3? So consistent? 

Similarly, second guess: ""sandy"" had A at position 2? But ""gonad"" has A at position 4? So A is not at position 2? So consistent? 

Also, D: in guess 2, D was at position 4? But we got D(-)? So D should not be at position 4? And in ""gonad"", D is at position 5? So that's fine? 

Therefore, we guess ""gonad""? 

But note: we are making our fourth guess? And we have two possibilities? Or one? We think ""gonad"" is the only common word? 

So we go with that? 

Therefore, the guess is ""gonad"". 

But let's confirm the letters: 
- G: not tried? 
- O: we know is in the word? But at position 2? So we are not competing? 
- N, A, D: already confirmed? 

So <guess>gonad</guess>

However, if the word is ""gonad"", then we will get all ✓? 

But if not, then we have to reconsider? 

But given the information, ""gonad"" is the most likely? 

Are there any other words? 

Another idea: ""konad""? Not a word? 
""ponad""? Not English? 
""wonad""? Not? 

So I think ""gonad"" is the best bet? 

But note: the wordle dictionary? We don't know? But we assume ""gonad"" is acceptable? 

Therefore, we guess that? 

But to be safe, let's see the feedback? 

We have: 
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: D

And the first letter must be one that hasn't been tried and not ruled out? 

G hasn't been tried? And rules out letters are C,R,E,S,Y,M? 

Yes? 

So go ahead? 

So <guess>gonad</guess>### Thought Process:
- **Feedback Recap**:
  - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A and N are in the word but not at positions 3 and 4. C, R, E are absent.
  - **Guess 2 (""sandy"")**: N is confirmed at position 3 (✓). A is in the word but not at position 2 (-). D is in the word but not at position 4 (-). S and Y are absent.
  - **Guess 3 (""monad"")**: Confirms O at position 2 (✓), N at position 3 (✓), A at position 4 (✓), and D at position 5 (✓). M is absent (x).

- **Deductions**:
  - Positions 2–5 are confirmed: **O** (pos2), **N** (pos3), **A** (pos4), **D** (pos5).  
    → The word must be `_ONAD`.
  - Only position 1 is unknown.
  - Absent letters so far: **C, R, E, S, Y, M** (all marked ""x"").
  - The missing letter must be:
    - A **new letter** not yet guessed (C, R, A, N, E, S, D, Y, M, O have been tested).
    - Not one of the absent letters listed above.
  - Possible candidates: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.
  - The guess must form a valid English word ending in `ONAD`.

- **Word Selection**:
  - Common English words fitting `_ONAD`:
    - **""gonad""** (valid term in biology).
    - Other combinations like ""tonad"", ""nonad"", etc., are rare or invalid.
  - ""gonad"" uses **G** (untested letter), and avoids all absent/used letters.
  - Given the pattern, ""gonad"" is the only feasible common word.

- **Conclusion**:  
  Guess ""gonad"" to test position 1. If correct, G must be in position 1; if incorrect, we know to retry other options (e.g., with B, T, etc.).",Guess 4: gonad -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) O(✓) N(✓) A(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
