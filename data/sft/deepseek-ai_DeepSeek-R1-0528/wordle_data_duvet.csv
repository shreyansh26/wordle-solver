Alright, the user is asking me to make my first guess in a Wordle-like game. Since it's the first attempt, I need to choose a strategic starting word that maximizes information gain. 

Hmm... the classic approach is to pick a word with common letters and avoid repeats. Words like ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""ROAST"" are popular openers. ""CRANE"" feels solid - it's got C, R, A, N, E which are all frequent consonants/vowels. 

Wait, I should consider positional frequency too. E is common as the last letter, C often starts words... yeah ""CRANE"" covers good ground. Plus no duplicate letters, so no wasted guesses. 

*checks mental dictionary* Is CRANE valid? Definitely - it's a real word meaning lifting device or long-necked bird. Perfect. 

This'll give clean feedback to narrow down possibilities fast. If I get ✓s/-s on any of these letters, I'll have strong clues for the next guess. 

Alright, locked in: CRANE.

After analyzing common Wordle strategies, a strong first guess should maximize letter diversity and cover frequent vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
- Contains three common vowels (A, E) and useful consonants (C, R, N)
- No repeated letters
- Tests vowel positions (A in middle, E at end)
- High-frequency letters provide actionable feedback

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

This means:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"", E is the last letter).

So the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position. Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, or N.

We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, N (since they are marked as absent)
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (so E must be in one of the first four positions: 1,2,3,4)

Additionally, we want to maximize information by using common letters that we haven't tested yet. Since we know E is in the word, we can try to place E in a different position and also test other common consonants and vowels.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that the word has an E, so we should include E and avoid the excluded letters.

We can try to use a word that has E in one of the positions 1-4 and uses other common letters.

Let's think of words that have E and avoid C,R,A,N.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: e.g., E _ _ _ _
- Position 2: e.g., _ E _ _ _
- Position 3: e.g., _ _ E _ _
- Position 4: e.g., _ _ _ E _

We also want to test other vowels (like O, I, U) and common consonants.

Since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it's not at the end, we can try to put E in the second position and test other common letters.

A good candidate might be a word like ""BELIE"" but that has repeated E? Also, we don't know if the word has repeated letters. But we should avoid repeats for maximum information.

Alternatively, consider ""BELOW"", but that has E in position 2 and O at the end. However, we don't know if O is in the word.

Another idea: ""SPIEL"" but that has 5 letters? Let me check: S-P-I-E-L -> 5 letters. But E is in position 4? We want to test E in a different position.

We can try to put E in position 1: words like ""EIGHT"" (but has G and H, which are good to test) or ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W).

But note: we haven't tested S, T, L, O, etc. These are common.

Another common starting word is ""TOISE"" but that's not a word. How about ""TILES""? But that doesn't have E? We need E.

We must include E.

Let me list some words that have E and avoid C,R,A,N:

- Position 1: E, then avoid C,R,A,N: e.g., E, then from B,D,F,G,H,... 
  Examples: EGGED (but repeated letters, not ideal), EIGHT, ELBOW, ELSIN (not common), maybe ""EJECT"" but has C? C is excluded. So no.

Better: ""ELBOW"": E (position1), L, B, O, W -> all new letters.

- Position 2: e.g., _ E _ _ _ 
  Words: BELOW, HELLO (but repeated L), JELLY (has L repeated? J-E-L-L-Y -> repeated L). 
  How about ""DEBIT"": D-E-B-I-T -> but we don't have E in position2? Actually, it does: D (1), E (2), B (3), I (4), T (5). But we know E is not in position5, but that doesn't restrict position2. However, we must avoid A (in DEBIT? no A) and C,R,A,N. DEBIT: D, E, B, I, T -> none of the excluded. So that's a candidate.

- Position 3: e.g., _ _ E _ _
  Words: TABLE (but has A? A is excluded) -> invalid. 
  How about ""GUEST"": G-U-E-S-T -> E in position3. Avoids C,R,A,N.

- Position 4: e.g., _ _ _ E _
  Words: MOVIE (M-O-V-I-E -> but E is at the end? position5? we need E not in position5, so position4 is allowed). 
  But MOVIE: M(1),O(2),V(3),I(4),E(5) -> E is in position5, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use E in position5. But position4 is allowed. 
  Example: ""SPIKE"": S-P-I-K-E -> E is in position5? That's the same as last time. We need E not in position5. So we can have E in position4? 
  How about ""SPIEL"": S-P-I-E-L -> E is in position4. That's allowed.

But note: we don't know if the word has repeated letters, but we should avoid them for now to test more letters.

So candidates:
1. ELBOW: E in pos1, tests E,L,B,O,W
2. DEBIT: E in pos2, tests D,E,B,I,T
3. GUEST: E in pos3, tests G,U,E,S,T
4. SPIEL: E in pos4, tests S,P,I,E,L

We want to choose one that uses common letters and might help us narrow down.

Note: We have only one E so far, but the word might have more than one E? The feedback only showed one E (as present but wrong position) and didn't say anything about duplicates. But we don't know. So we should avoid using E twice in our guess to avoid confusion.

All the above candidates have only one E.

Now, which one to pick? We also want to cover vowels. We haven't tested I, O, U. 

In ELBOW: vowels are E and O.
In DEBIT: vowels are E and I.
In GUEST: vowels are U and E.
In SPIEL: vowels are I and E.

All are good.

But we also want to test common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

Let's see the frequency of letters in English 5-letter words:

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.

We haven't tested: S, T, L, D, B, G, H, etc.

In DEBIT: D, B, I, T -> and E. So we test D, B, I, T, E.

In GUEST: G, U, E, S, T -> tests G, U, S, T, E.

In SPIEL: S, P, I, E, L -> tests S, P, I, L, E.

In ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> tests L, B, O, W, E.

We know E is in the word, so we are testing 4 new letters in each.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters (C,R,A,N) and we are.

I think ""DEBIT"" is a good choice because it tests two vowels (E and I) and common consonants (D, B, T). Also, it places E in position2, which we haven't tested.

Alternatively, ""GUEST"" tests S and T which are very common.

But let's consider: we know E is in the word but not at the end. So if we put E in position2, we might get feedback on whether it's in that position or not.

Similarly, we can try to cover more vowels.

Another candidate: ""MEDIA"" but A is excluded -> invalid.

""TOWIE"" not a word? 

""PIOUS"" but no E.

We must have E.

I think ""DEBIT"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if ""DEBIT"" is a valid word: yes, meaning an amount owed.

Alternatively, ""BEIGE"" but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end. ""BEIGE"" has E at the end and at the beginning? B-E-I-G-E -> positions: B(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), E(5). So it has E at position2 and 5. But we know E is not at position5, so we cannot use a word that has E at position5. So ""BEIGE"" would be invalid because it has E at position5? Actually, we can use it? The rule is that the guess must be a valid word, but we are allowed to guess words that have E at the end even if we know it's not there? But it would be inefficient because we already know E is not at the end. So we should avoid putting E at the end to test other positions.

In ""DEBIT"", E is at position2 and no E at the end. So that's good.

Similarly, ""GUEST"" has E at position3 and no E at the end.

""SPIEL"" has E at position4 and no E at the end.

""ELBOW"" has E at position1 and no E at the end.

So all are acceptable.

I think I'll go with ""GUEST"" because it tests S and T which are very common, and U (a vowel) and G.

But let's see the frequency: S and T are more common than B and D? Actually, S is the most common letter, then T.

In ""GUEST"": G, U, E, S, T -> tests S and T.

In ""DEBIT"": D, E, B, I, T -> tests T and D, B.

In ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> tests S and L.

In ""ELBOW"": L, B, O, W -> no S or T.

So ""GUEST"" and ""SPIEL"" test S, which is very common.

But ""GUEST"" also tests T, which is also common.

So ""GUEST"" might be better.

We can also consider ""HOUSE"" but E is at the end -> invalid because we know E is not at the end. So we cannot use words that have E at the end.

Similarly, ""HOMES"" -> E at the end? H-O-M-E-S -> E is at position4? H(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), S(5). So E is at position4, which is allowed. But we don't know if the word has H, O, M, S. But we haven't tested H, O, M, S. So ""HOMES"" is a candidate: H-O-M-E-S.

But we already have E in position4? We don't know if E is in position4 or not, but we can test.

But ""HOMES"" has E in position4 and avoids C,R,A,N.

Similarly, we have many options.

But to maximize new letters, and common ones: S, T, L, O, etc.

I think ""GUEST"" is a good choice because it tests two of the most common consonants (S and T) and a vowel (U) and E in a new position (position3).

So I'll go with ""GUEST"".

But let me confirm: G-U-E-S-T.

Positions: 1: G, 2: U, 3: E, 4: S, 5: T.

We know E is in the word, but not at position5. We are testing E at position3.

If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at position3. If we get a -, then E is in the word but not at position3 (and not at position5, so it must be at 1,2, or4). If we get an x? But we know E is in the word, so it cannot be x. So for E, we expect either ✓ or -.

Similarly, we test G, U, S, T.

So we get information about these.

Therefore, I choose ""GUEST"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is **present** but not in the 5th position (marked ""-"" in position 5).

### Key Deductions:
1. The secret word **contains E**, but E cannot be in position 5. It must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
2. The word **excludes** C, R, A, and N entirely.
3. For the next guess:
   - Must include E in position 1–4.
   - Avoid C, R, A, N.
   - Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) to maximize information.

### Strategy for Second Guess:
- **Test E in a new position**: Since E was in position 5 last time, placing it in position 3 (middle) could help triangulate its location.
- **Cover common consonants and vowels**: Focus on untested letters like S, T, G, U, I, O, L, etc. S and T are among the most frequent consonants in English.
- **Avoid repeats**: Use distinct letters to test more possibilities.

Selected ""GUEST"" because:
- Places E in **position 3** (new position to test).
- Tests new high-value letters: **S** (most common letter), **T** (second most common), **G**, and **U** (vowel).
- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.
- Valid 5-letter word (meaning: a visitor or customer).

This guess will provide feedback on:
- Whether E is correctly placed at position 3 (✓), or if it's elsewhere (-).
- Presence/absence of S, T, G, and U, helping narrow the word list significantly.

<guess>guest</guess>",guest,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

This means:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"", E is the last letter).

So the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position. Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, or N.

We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, N (since they are marked as absent)
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (so E must be in one of the first four positions: 1,2,3,4)

Additionally, we want to maximize information by using common letters that we haven't tested yet. Since we know E is in the word, we can try to place E in a different position and also test other common consonants and vowels.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that the word has an E, so we should include E and avoid the excluded letters.

We can try to use a word that has E in one of the positions 1-4 and uses other common letters.

Let's think of words that have E and avoid C,R,A,N.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: e.g., E _ _ _ _
- Position 2: e.g., _ E _ _ _
- Position 3: e.g., _ _ E _ _
- Position 4: e.g., _ _ _ E _

We also want to test other vowels (like O, I, U) and common consonants.

Since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it's not at the end, we can try to put E in the second position and test other common letters.

A good candidate might be a word like ""BELIE"" but that has repeated E? Also, we don't know if the word has repeated letters. But we should avoid repeats for maximum information.

Alternatively, consider ""BELOW"", but that has E in position 2 and O at the end. However, we don't know if O is in the word.

Another idea: ""SPIEL"" but that has 5 letters? Let me check: S-P-I-E-L -> 5 letters. But E is in position 4? We want to test E in a different position.

We can try to put E in position 1: words like ""EIGHT"" (but has G and H, which are good to test) or ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W).

But note: we haven't tested S, T, L, O, etc. These are common.

Another common starting word is ""TOISE"" but that's not a word. How about ""TILES""? But that doesn't have E? We need E.

We must include E.

Let me list some words that have E and avoid C,R,A,N:

- Position 1: E, then avoid C,R,A,N: e.g., E, then from B,D,F,G,H,... 
  Examples: EGGED (but repeated letters, not ideal), EIGHT, ELBOW, ELSIN (not common), maybe ""EJECT"" but has C? C is excluded. So no.

Better: ""ELBOW"": E (position1), L, B, O, W -> all new letters.

- Position 2: e.g., _ E _ _ _ 
  Words: BELOW, HELLO (but repeated L), JELLY (has L repeated? J-E-L-L-Y -> repeated L). 
  How about ""DEBIT"": D-E-B-I-T -> but we don't have E in position2? Actually, it does: D (1), E (2), B (3), I (4), T (5). But we know E is not in position5, but that doesn't restrict position2. However, we must avoid A (in DEBIT? no A) and C,R,A,N. DEBIT: D, E, B, I, T -> none of the excluded. So that's a candidate.

- Position 3: e.g., _ _ E _ _
  Words: TABLE (but has A? A is excluded) -> invalid. 
  How about ""GUEST"": G-U-E-S-T -> E in position3. Avoids C,R,A,N.

- Position 4: e.g., _ _ _ E _
  Words: MOVIE (M-O-V-I-E -> but E is at the end? position5? we need E not in position5, so position4 is allowed). 
  But MOVIE: M(1),O(2),V(3),I(4),E(5) -> E is in position5, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use E in position5. But position4 is allowed. 
  Example: ""SPIKE"": S-P-I-K-E -> E is in position5? That's the same as last time. We need E not in position5. So we can have E in position4? 
  How about ""SPIEL"": S-P-I-E-L -> E is in position4. That's allowed.

But note: we don't know if the word has repeated letters, but we should avoid them for now to test more letters.

So candidates:
1. ELBOW: E in pos1, tests E,L,B,O,W
2. DEBIT: E in pos2, tests D,E,B,I,T
3. GUEST: E in pos3, tests G,U,E,S,T
4. SPIEL: E in pos4, tests S,P,I,E,L

We want to choose one that uses common letters and might help us narrow down.

Note: We have only one E so far, but the word might have more than one E? The feedback only showed one E (as present but wrong position) and didn't say anything about duplicates. But we don't know. So we should avoid using E twice in our guess to avoid confusion.

All the above candidates have only one E.

Now, which one to pick? We also want to cover vowels. We haven't tested I, O, U. 

In ELBOW: vowels are E and O.
In DEBIT: vowels are E and I.
In GUEST: vowels are U and E.
In SPIEL: vowels are I and E.

All are good.

But we also want to test common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

Let's see the frequency of letters in English 5-letter words:

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.

We haven't tested: S, T, L, D, B, G, H, etc.

In DEBIT: D, B, I, T -> and E. So we test D, B, I, T, E.

In GUEST: G, U, E, S, T -> tests G, U, S, T, E.

In SPIEL: S, P, I, E, L -> tests S, P, I, L, E.

In ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> tests L, B, O, W, E.

We know E is in the word, so we are testing 4 new letters in each.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters (C,R,A,N) and we are.

I think ""DEBIT"" is a good choice because it tests two vowels (E and I) and common consonants (D, B, T). Also, it places E in position2, which we haven't tested.

Alternatively, ""GUEST"" tests S and T which are very common.

But let's consider: we know E is in the word but not at the end. So if we put E in position2, we might get feedback on whether it's in that position or not.

Similarly, we can try to cover more vowels.

Another candidate: ""MEDIA"" but A is excluded -> invalid.

""TOWIE"" not a word? 

""PIOUS"" but no E.

We must have E.

I think ""DEBIT"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if ""DEBIT"" is a valid word: yes, meaning an amount owed.

Alternatively, ""BEIGE"" but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end. ""BEIGE"" has E at the end and at the beginning? B-E-I-G-E -> positions: B(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), E(5). So it has E at position2 and 5. But we know E is not at position5, so we cannot use a word that has E at position5. So ""BEIGE"" would be invalid because it has E at position5? Actually, we can use it? The rule is that the guess must be a valid word, but we are allowed to guess words that have E at the end even if we know it's not there? But it would be inefficient because we already know E is not at the end. So we should avoid putting E at the end to test other positions.

In ""DEBIT"", E is at position2 and no E at the end. So that's good.

Similarly, ""GUEST"" has E at position3 and no E at the end.

""SPIEL"" has E at position4 and no E at the end.

""ELBOW"" has E at position1 and no E at the end.

So all are acceptable.

I think I'll go with ""GUEST"" because it tests S and T which are very common, and U (a vowel) and G.

But let's see the frequency: S and T are more common than B and D? Actually, S is the most common letter, then T.

In ""GUEST"": G, U, E, S, T -> tests S and T.

In ""DEBIT"": D, E, B, I, T -> tests T and D, B.

In ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> tests S and L.

In ""ELBOW"": L, B, O, W -> no S or T.

So ""GUEST"" and ""SPIEL"" test S, which is very common.

But ""GUEST"" also tests T, which is also common.

So ""GUEST"" might be better.

We can also consider ""HOUSE"" but E is at the end -> invalid because we know E is not at the end. So we cannot use words that have E at the end.

Similarly, ""HOMES"" -> E at the end? H-O-M-E-S -> E is at position4? H(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), S(5). So E is at position4, which is allowed. But we don't know if the word has H, O, M, S. But we haven't tested H, O, M, S. So ""HOMES"" is a candidate: H-O-M-E-S.

But we already have E in position4? We don't know if E is in position4 or not, but we can test.

But ""HOMES"" has E in position4 and avoids C,R,A,N.

Similarly, we have many options.

But to maximize new letters, and common ones: S, T, L, O, etc.

I think ""GUEST"" is a good choice because it tests two of the most common consonants (S and T) and a vowel (U) and E in a new position (position3).

So I'll go with ""GUEST"".

But let me confirm: G-U-E-S-T.

Positions: 1: G, 2: U, 3: E, 4: S, 5: T.

We know E is in the word, but not at position5. We are testing E at position3.

If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at position3. If we get a -, then E is in the word but not at position3 (and not at position5, so it must be at 1,2, or4). If we get an x? But we know E is in the word, so it cannot be x. So for E, we expect either ✓ or -.

Similarly, we test G, U, S, T.

So we get information about these.

Therefore, I choose ""GUEST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is **present** but not in the 5th position (marked ""-"" in position 5).

### Key Deductions:
1. The secret word **contains E**, but E cannot be in position 5. It must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
2. The word **excludes** C, R, A, and N entirely.
3. For the next guess:
   - Must include E in position 1–4.
   - Avoid C, R, A, N.
   - Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) to maximize information.

### Strategy for Second Guess:
- **Test E in a new position**: Since E was in position 5 last time, placing it in position 3 (middle) could help triangulate its location.
- **Cover common consonants and vowels**: Focus on untested letters like S, T, G, U, I, O, L, etc. S and T are among the most frequent consonants in English.
- **Avoid repeats**: Use distinct letters to test more possibilities.

Selected ""GUEST"" because:
- Places E in **position 3** (new position to test).
- Tests new high-value letters: **S** (most common letter), **T** (second most common), **G**, and **U** (vowel).
- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.
- Valid 5-letter word (meaning: a visitor or customer).

This guess will provide feedback on:
- Whether E is correctly placed at position 3 (✓), or if it's elsewhere (-).
- Presence/absence of S, T, G, and U, helping narrow the word list significantly.",Guess 2: guest -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(✓) E(-) S(x) T(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, the user is asking me to make my first guess in a Wordle-like game. Since it's the first attempt, I need to choose a strategic starting word that maximizes information gain. 

Hmm... the classic approach is to pick a word with common letters and avoid repeats. Words like ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""ROAST"" are popular openers. ""CRANE"" feels solid - it's got C, R, A, N, E which are all frequent consonants/vowels. 

Wait, I should consider positional frequency too. E is common as the last letter, C often starts words... yeah ""CRANE"" covers good ground. Plus no duplicate letters, so no wasted guesses. 

*checks mental dictionary* Is CRANE valid? Definitely - it's a real word meaning lifting device or long-necked bird. Perfect. 

This'll give clean feedback to narrow down possibilities fast. If I get ✓s/-s on any of these letters, I'll have strong clues for the next guess. 

Alright, locked in: CRANE.After analyzing common Wordle strategies, a strong first guess should maximize letter diversity and cover frequent vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
- Contains three common vowels (A, E) and useful consonants (C, R, N)
- No repeated letters
- Tests vowel positions (A in middle, E at end)
- High-frequency letters provide actionable feedback

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

This means:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"", E is the last letter).

So the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position. Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, or N.

We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, N (since they are marked as absent)
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (so E must be in one of the first four positions: 1,2,3,4)

Additionally, we want to maximize information by using common letters that we haven't tested yet. Since we know E is in the word, we can try to place E in a different position and also test other common consonants and vowels.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that the word has an E, so we should include E and avoid the excluded letters.

We can try to use a word that has E in one of the positions 1-4 and uses other common letters.

Let's think of words that have E and avoid C,R,A,N.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: e.g., E _ _ _ _
- Position 2: e.g., _ E _ _ _
- Position 3: e.g., _ _ E _ _
- Position 4: e.g., _ _ _ E _

We also want to test other vowels (like O, I, U) and common consonants.

Since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it's not at the end, we can try to put E in the second position and test other common letters.

A good candidate might be a word like ""BELIE"" but that has repeated E? Also, we don't know if the word has repeated letters. But we should avoid repeats for maximum information.

Alternatively, consider ""BELOW"", but that has E in position 2 and O at the end. However, we don't know if O is in the word.

Another idea: ""SPIEL"" but that has 5 letters? Let me check: S-P-I-E-L -> 5 letters. But E is in position 4? We want to test E in a different position.

We can try to put E in position 1: words like ""EIGHT"" (but has G and H, which are good to test) or ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W).

But note: we haven't tested S, T, L, O, etc. These are common.

Another common starting word is ""TOISE"" but that's not a word. How about ""TILES""? But that doesn't have E? We need E.

We must include E.

Let me list some words that have E and avoid C,R,A,N:

- Position 1: E, then avoid C,R,A,N: e.g., E, then from B,D,F,G,H,... 
  Examples: EGGED (but repeated letters, not ideal), EIGHT, ELBOW, ELSIN (not common), maybe ""EJECT"" but has C? C is excluded. So no.

Better: ""ELBOW"": E (position1), L, B, O, W -> all new letters.

- Position 2: e.g., _ E _ _ _ 
  Words: BELOW, HELLO (but repeated L), JELLY (has L repeated? J-E-L-L-Y -> repeated L). 
  How about ""DEBIT"": D-E-B-I-T -> but we don't have E in position2? Actually, it does: D (1), E (2), B (3), I (4), T (5). But we know E is not in position5, but that doesn't restrict position2. However, we must avoid A (in DEBIT? no A) and C,R,A,N. DEBIT: D, E, B, I, T -> none of the excluded. So that's a candidate.

- Position 3: e.g., _ _ E _ _
  Words: TABLE (but has A? A is excluded) -> invalid. 
  How about ""GUEST"": G-U-E-S-T -> E in position3. Avoids C,R,A,N.

- Position 4: e.g., _ _ _ E _
  Words: MOVIE (M-O-V-I-E -> but E is at the end? position5? we need E not in position5, so position4 is allowed). 
  But MOVIE: M(1),O(2),V(3),I(4),E(5) -> E is in position5, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use E in position5. But position4 is allowed. 
  Example: ""SPIKE"": S-P-I-K-E -> E is in position5? That's the same as last time. We need E not in position5. So we can have E in position4? 
  How about ""SPIEL"": S-P-I-E-L -> E is in position4. That's allowed.

But note: we don't know if the word has repeated letters, but we should avoid them for now to test more letters.

So candidates:
1. ELBOW: E in pos1, tests E,L,B,O,W
2. DEBIT: E in pos2, tests D,E,B,I,T
3. GUEST: E in pos3, tests G,U,E,S,T
4. SPIEL: E in pos4, tests S,P,I,E,L

We want to choose one that uses common letters and might help us narrow down.

Note: We have only one E so far, but the word might have more than one E? The feedback only showed one E (as present but wrong position) and didn't say anything about duplicates. But we don't know. So we should avoid using E twice in our guess to avoid confusion.

All the above candidates have only one E.

Now, which one to pick? We also want to cover vowels. We haven't tested I, O, U. 

In ELBOW: vowels are E and O.
In DEBIT: vowels are E and I.
In GUEST: vowels are U and E.
In SPIEL: vowels are I and E.

All are good.

But we also want to test common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

Let's see the frequency of letters in English 5-letter words:

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.

We haven't tested: S, T, L, D, B, G, H, etc.

In DEBIT: D, B, I, T -> and E. So we test D, B, I, T, E.

In GUEST: G, U, E, S, T -> tests G, U, S, T, E.

In SPIEL: S, P, I, E, L -> tests S, P, I, L, E.

In ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> tests L, B, O, W, E.

We know E is in the word, so we are testing 4 new letters in each.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters (C,R,A,N) and we are.

I think ""DEBIT"" is a good choice because it tests two vowels (E and I) and common consonants (D, B, T). Also, it places E in position2, which we haven't tested.

Alternatively, ""GUEST"" tests S and T which are very common.

But let's consider: we know E is in the word but not at the end. So if we put E in position2, we might get feedback on whether it's in that position or not.

Similarly, we can try to cover more vowels.

Another candidate: ""MEDIA"" but A is excluded -> invalid.

""TOWIE"" not a word? 

""PIOUS"" but no E.

We must have E.

I think ""DEBIT"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if ""DEBIT"" is a valid word: yes, meaning an amount owed.

Alternatively, ""BEIGE"" but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end. ""BEIGE"" has E at the end and at the beginning? B-E-I-G-E -> positions: B(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), E(5). So it has E at position2 and 5. But we know E is not at position5, so we cannot use a word that has E at position5. So ""BEIGE"" would be invalid because it has E at position5? Actually, we can use it? The rule is that the guess must be a valid word, but we are allowed to guess words that have E at the end even if we know it's not there? But it would be inefficient because we already know E is not at the end. So we should avoid putting E at the end to test other positions.

In ""DEBIT"", E is at position2 and no E at the end. So that's good.

Similarly, ""GUEST"" has E at position3 and no E at the end.

""SPIEL"" has E at position4 and no E at the end.

""ELBOW"" has E at position1 and no E at the end.

So all are acceptable.

I think I'll go with ""GUEST"" because it tests S and T which are very common, and U (a vowel) and G.

But let's see the frequency: S and T are more common than B and D? Actually, S is the most common letter, then T.

In ""GUEST"": G, U, E, S, T -> tests S and T.

In ""DEBIT"": D, E, B, I, T -> tests T and D, B.

In ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> tests S and L.

In ""ELBOW"": L, B, O, W -> no S or T.

So ""GUEST"" and ""SPIEL"" test S, which is very common.

But ""GUEST"" also tests T, which is also common.

So ""GUEST"" might be better.

We can also consider ""HOUSE"" but E is at the end -> invalid because we know E is not at the end. So we cannot use words that have E at the end.

Similarly, ""HOMES"" -> E at the end? H-O-M-E-S -> E is at position4? H(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), S(5). So E is at position4, which is allowed. But we don't know if the word has H, O, M, S. But we haven't tested H, O, M, S. So ""HOMES"" is a candidate: H-O-M-E-S.

But we already have E in position4? We don't know if E is in position4 or not, but we can test.

But ""HOMES"" has E in position4 and avoids C,R,A,N.

Similarly, we have many options.

But to maximize new letters, and common ones: S, T, L, O, etc.

I think ""GUEST"" is a good choice because it tests two of the most common consonants (S and T) and a vowel (U) and E in a new position (position3).

So I'll go with ""GUEST"".

But let me confirm: G-U-E-S-T.

Positions: 1: G, 2: U, 3: E, 4: S, 5: T.

We know E is in the word, but not at position5. We are testing E at position3.

If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at position3. If we get a -, then E is in the word but not at position3 (and not at position5, so it must be at 1,2, or4). If we get an x? But we know E is in the word, so it cannot be x. So for E, we expect either ✓ or -.

DEBIT: E in pos2, tests D,E,B,I,T\n3. GUEST: E in pos3, tests G,U,E,S,T\n4. SPIEL: E in pos4, tests S,P,I,E,L\n\nWe want to choose one that uses common letters and might help us narrow down.\n\nNote: We have only one E so far, but the word might have more than one E? The feedback only showed one E (as present but wrong position) and didn\'t say anything about duplicates. But we don\'t know. So we should avoid using E twice in our guess to avoid confusion.\n\nAll the above candidates have only one E.\n\nNow, which one to pick? We also want to cover vowels. We haven\'t tested I, O, U. \n\nIn ELBOW: vowels are E and O.\nIn DEBIT: vowels are E and I.\nIn GUEST: vowels are U and E.\nIn SPIEL: vowels are I and E.\n\nAll are good.\n\nBut we also want to test common consonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\nLet\'s see the frequency of letters in English 5-letter words:\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: S, T, L, D, B, G, H, etc.\n\nIn DEBIT: D, B, I, T -> and E. So we test D, B, I, T, E.\n\nIn GUEST: G, U, E, S, T -> tests G, U, S, T, E.\n\nIn SPIEL: S, P, I, E, L -> tests S, P, I, L, E.\n\nIn ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> tests L, B, O, W, E.\n\nWe know E is in the word, so we are testing 4 new letters in each.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters (C,R,A,N) and we are.\n\nI think ""DEBIT"" is a good choice because it tests two vowels (E and I) and common consonants (D, B, T). Also, it places E in position2, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nAlternatively, ""GUEST"" tests S and T which are very common.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we know E is in the word but not at the end. So if we put E in position2, we might get feedback on whether it\'s in that position or not.\n\nSimilarly, we can try to cover more vowels.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MEDIA"" but A is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""TOWIE"" not a word? \n\n""PIOUS"" but no E.\n\nWe must have E.\n\nI think ""DEBIT"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me check if ""DEBIT"" is a valid word: yes, meaning an amount owed.\n\nAlternatively, ""BEIGE"" but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end. ""BEIGE"" has E at the end and at the beginning? B-E-I-G-E -> positions: B(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), E(5). So it has E at position2 and 5. But we know E is not at position5, so we cannot use a word that has E at position5. So ""BEIGE"" would be invalid because it has E at position5? Actually, we can use it? The rule is that the guess must be a valid word, but we are allowed to guess words that have E at the end even if we know it\'s not there? But it would be inefficient because we already know E is not at the end. So we should avoid putting E at the end to test other positions.\n\nIn ""DEBIT"", E is at position2 and no E at the end. So that\'s good.\n\nSimilarly, ""GUEST"" has E at position3 and no E at the end.\n\n""SPIEL"" has E at position4 and no E at the end.\n\n""ELBOW"" has E at position1 and no E at the end.\n\nSo all are acceptable.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""GUEST"" because it tests S and T which are very common, and U (a vowel) and G.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: S and T are more common than B and D? Actually, S is the most common letter, then T.\n\nIn ""GUEST"": G, U, E, S, T -> tests S and T.\n\nIn ""DEBIT"": D, E, B, I, T -> tests T and D, B.\n\nIn ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> tests S and L.\n\nIn ""ELBOW"": L, B, O, W -> no S or T.\n\nSo ""GUEST"" and ""SPIEL"" test S, which is very common.\n\nBut ""GUEST"" also tests T, which is also common.\n\nSo ""GUEST"" might be better.\n\nWe can also consider ""HOUSE"" but E is at the end -> invalid because we know E is not at the end. So we cannot use words that have E at the end.\n\nSimilarly, ""HOMES"" -> E at the end? H-O-M-E-S -> E is at position4? H(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), S(5). So E is at position4, which is allowed. But we don\'t know if the word has H, O, M, S. But we haven\'t tested H, O, M, S. So ""HOMES"" is a candidate: H-O-M-E-S.\n\nBut we already have E in position4? We don\'t know if E is in position4 or not, but we can test.\n\nBut ""HOMES"" has E in position4 and avoids C,R,A,N.\n\nSimilarly, we have many options.\n\nBut to maximize new letters, and common ones: S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nI think ""GUEST"" is a good choice because it tests two of the most common consonants (S and T) and a vowel (U) and E in a new position (position3).\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""GUEST"".\n\nBut let me confirm: G-U-E-S-T.\n\nPositions: 1: G, 2: U, 3: E, 4: S, 5: T.\n\nWe know E is in the word, but not at position5. We are testing E at position3.\n\nIf we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at position3. If we get a -, then E is in the word but not at position3 (and not at position5, so it must be at 1,2, or4). If we get an x? But we know E is in the word, so it cannot be x. So for E, we expect either ✓ or -.\n\nSimilarly, we test G, U, S, T.\n\nSo we get information about these.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""GUEST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- E is **present** but not in the 5th position (marked ""-"" in position 5).\n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. The secret word **contains E**, but E cannot be in position 5. It must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n2. The word **excludes** C, R, A, and N entirely.\n3. For the next guess:\n   - Must include E in position 1–4.\n   - Avoid C, R, A, N.\n   - Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) to maximize information.\n\n### Strategy for Second Guess:\n- **Test E in a new position**: Since E was in position 5 last time, placing it in position 3 (middle) could help triangulate its location.\n- **Cover common consonants and vowels**: Focus on untested letters like S, T, G, U, I, O, L, etc. S and T are among the most frequent consonants in English.\n- **Avoid repeats**: Use distinct letters to test more possibilities.\n\nSelected ""GUEST"" because:\n- Places E in **position 3** (new position to test).\n- Tests new high-value letters: **S** (most common letter), **T** (second most common), **G**, and **U** (vowel).\n- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.\n- Valid 5-letter word (meaning: a visitor or customer).\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on:\n- Whether E is correctly placed at position 3 (✓), or if it\'s elsewhere (-).\n- Presence/absence of S, T, G, and U, helping narrow the word list significantly.\n\n<guess>guest</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: guest -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(✓) E(-) S(x) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.
- E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""guest"" -> G(x), U(✓), E(-), S(x), T(✓)
Meaning:
- G and S are absent.
- U is correct and in position 2 (since in ""guest"", U is the second letter).
- E is present but not in position 3 (because we got a '-' for E in position 3).
- T is correct and in position 5 (since in ""guest"", T is the fifth letter).

So, from the feedback we know:

1. The secret word has the following confirmed:
   - U in position 2.
   - T in position 5.
   - E is present, but not in position 3 or 5 (we already knew not in 5, now also not in 3).

2. The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, G, S.

3. E must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2, 3, and 5 are taken by U, ?, and T, and E cannot be in 3 or 5, and position 2 is U so E can't be there either? Wait, position 2 is fixed as U, so E cannot be in position 2. Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 4).

Let's list the positions:
Position 1: unknown, but E could be here.
Position 2: U (confirmed)
Position 3: unknown, but E is not here (from the '-' in guess2) and it's not any of the excluded letters.
Position 4: unknown, E could be here.
Position 5: T (confirmed)

So the word structure is: [1: ? or E] [2: U] [3: ?] [4: ? or E] [5: T]

But note: E is present, so it must be in either position 1 or 4.

Also, we have excluded letters: C, R, A, N, G, S.

We have 6 tries and this is the third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has U in position 2 and T in position 5.
- Contains the letter E, which must be in position 1 or 4.
- Avoids the letters C, R, A, N, G, S.

Additionally, we want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.

Let's consider the possibilities for E:

Case 1: E in position 1 -> word starts with E, then U in position 2, then an unknown in 3, then unknown in 4, then T.

Case 2: E in position 4 -> then position 1 is not E, and we have: [1: not E] [2: U] [3: ?] [4: E] [5: T]

We also need to fill position 3 and the other position (1 or 4) with letters that are not excluded.

We haven't tested many letters yet. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, G, U, S, T.

But U and T are confirmed, and E is confirmed but not positioned. The others are absent.

So available letters: all except C, R, A, N, G, S (and we know E, U, T are in, but we can use them again? We have to be cautious: the word might have repeated letters? But we don't know. However, to maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters unless necessary. But in this case, we are forced to use E, U, T? Actually, we are required to have U and T in their positions, and E must appear. But we don't have to repeat U or T because they are already placed. We only need to place E and the other two positions.

But note: the word must have exactly the letters we guess? No, we are guessing. We are trying to find the secret word.

But for the guess, we must form a valid word that fits the constraints.

We can try to design a guess that distinguishes between the two cases (E in 1 or 4) and tests new letters.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern:

Pattern: _ U _ _ T

With E in position 1 or 4, and avoiding C,R,A,N,G,S.

First, if E is in position 1: then the word is E U _ _ T.

What can we put in positions 3 and 4? We need two letters that are not excluded and form a valid word.

Possible words: 
- E U C H T? But C is excluded -> invalid.
- E U P H T? EUPHT is not a word.
- E U L E T? But that would have two E's? And E is in position 1 and 4? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, ""EULET"" is not a word.
- E U P L T? Not a word.
- E U L K T? ""ELUKT"" not a word.
- E U D O T? ""EUDOT"" not a word.

Common words: 
- ""EXULT"": but X is not excluded? We haven't tested X. But ""EXULT"" has E in position1, X in 3, U in 2, L in 4, T in 5. But we have excluded S, but not L. So ""EXULT"" is a word? Yes, meaning to show triumph. But note: we have to avoid G and S, but L is not excluded. Also, we haven't tested L. So that's a candidate.

But in ""EXULT"", E is in position1, and we are testing X and L.

Now, if E is in position4: then the word is _ U _ E T.

Possible words:
- B U L E T? ""BULET"" not a word. But ""BULLET"" is 6 letters.
- D U E T? ""DUET"" is 4 letters? No, 4 letters. We need 5 letters.
- M U S E T? But S is excluded -> invalid.
- P U L E T? ""PULET"" not a word. ""PULLET"" is 6.
- Q U I E T? But I is not excluded? ""QUIET"": Q(1), U(2), I(3), E(4), T(5). That's a valid word. And it avoids excluded letters: C,R,A,N,G,S? Q, U, I, E, T. U and T are known, E is known, Q and I are new. But Q is not excluded? We haven't tested Q. So ""QUIET"" is a candidate.

But note: in ""QUIET"", E is in position4, which is one of the possibilities.

Now, we have two candidate words: ""EXULT"" (E in pos1) and ""QUIET"" (E in pos4). But we don't know which one is correct, and we need to guess one.

But we can also think of other words.

Another word for E in pos1: ""EDUCT""? But D is not excluded, but ""EDUCT"" is a word? Meaning something drawn out. But it has C? E-D-U-C-T -> C is excluded -> invalid.

""EVICT""? But C is excluded -> invalid.

""EMPTY""? But M, P, T, Y. T is already in position5? ""EMPTY"": E(1), M(2), P(3), T(4), Y(5). But we need position2 to be U, not M. So that doesn't fit the pattern.

We must have U in position2 and T in position5.

So for E in pos1: ""EXULT"" is a candidate.

For E in pos4: ""QUIET"" is a candidate.

But are there others?

E in pos4: ""SUITE""? But S is excluded -> invalid.

""JUICE""? But C is excluded -> invalid.

""BUYER""? But position5 is T, not R. ""BUYER"" ends with R.

""DUVET""? D-U-V-E-T. That's a word! Meaning a type of quilt. And it has E in position4? D(1), U(2), V(3), E(4), T(5). So that fits. And avoids excluded letters: D, V are new and not excluded.

So ""DUVET"" is another candidate for E in pos4.

Also, ""QUIET"" and ""DUVET"" both have E in pos4.

Now, for E in pos1: ""EXULT"" is one, but are there others?

""EJECT""? C excluded.

""ERUPT""? R excluded.

""ENACT""? N and C excluded.

So ""EXULT"" might be the only common one.

But we also have ""EXPEL""? But P and L, but position5 is T, not L. ""EXPEL"" ends with L.

So ""EXULT"" is a good candidate for E in pos1.

Now, we have two cases, and we need to choose a guess that can help us distinguish and also test new letters.

We can try to guess a word that has E in position1, but then we are assuming that case, or similarly for position4.

But we don't know which case it is. So we should choose a guess that works regardless of where E is, but that tests the position of E and other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in one of the positions and tests the other.

But note: we must have U in position2 and T in position5, and E must be in 1 or 4.

So let's list the positions:

Position 1: must be E or some other letter (if E is in 4)
Position 2: U
Position 3: must be a letter that is not excluded and not E (since E is not in pos3)
Position 4: must be E or some other letter (if E is in 1)
Position 5: T

We need to fill position1,3,4 with the constraints.

We can try to use a word that has E in position1 and a different letter in position4, or vice versa.

But we also want to test new common letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E, but we know it's in, and U,T are fixed).

We should avoid using too many rare letters.

Let's try to form a word:

Option 1: Assume E in position1: then word is E U ? ? T

We need two letters for positions 3 and 4. We can use common letters like L, I, P, etc.

But we already thought of ""EXULT"" with X and L.

Option 2: Assume E in position4: then word is ? U ? E T

We can have ""QUIET"" with Q and I, or ""DUVET"" with D and V.

But we don't know which one is correct.

We could choose a word that doesn't commit to E in 1 or 4 but tests both possibilities? But we have to have E in one of them.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in position1 and tests position4 with a new letter, or vice versa.

But note: we have to make a valid word.

Another idea: use a word that has E in position1 and also tests a common letter in position4, and a common letter in position3.

For example, ""EUROT""? Not a word.

""EIGHT"" but position2 is U, not I.

We must have U in position2.

So let's list possible words:

For E in pos1: 
- EXULT (X in pos3, L in pos4)

For E in pos4:
- QUIET (Q in pos1, I in pos3)
- DUVET (D in pos1, V in pos3)
- Other: ""SUQET""? Not a word. ""CUVET""? C excluded. ""HUTET""? Not a word. ""LUTED""? But D in pos5, not T? ""LUTED"" is L-U-T-E-D, so T in pos3? But we need T in pos5. Not matching.

""PURET""? Not a word. ""JUMET""? Not a word.

""BUTEI""? Not a word.

So the common ones are: EXULT (E in 1), QUIET (E in 4), DUVET (E in 4).

Now, we need to choose one as our guess. But we don't know which pattern is correct.

We can choose ""EXULT"" to test the E-in-pos1 case. If it's correct, we win. If not, we know E must be in pos4.

Similarly, if we choose ""QUIET"" or ""DUVET"", we test E-in-pos4.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's see the letters tested:

- EXULT: tests X and L (and confirms E, U, T positions, but we already know U and T are fixed, and E is present but we are testing its position).
- QUIET: tests Q and I.
- DUVET: tests D and V.

Which letters are more common? I and L are very common, D is common, X and Q are less common.

So perhaps testing I and L is better.

But we can also consider a word that tests both I and L? But we have to fit the pattern.

Is there a word that has U in pos2, T in pos5, E in either 1 or 4, and uses I and L?

For example, if E in pos1: E U ? ? T, and we want I and L. But we have two positions: 3 and 4. So we could have E U I L T? ""EUILT"" not a word. E U L I T? ""ELUIT"" not a word.

If E in pos4: ? U ? E T, and we want I and L. So position1 and 3: I and L? For example, L U I E T? ""LUIET"" not a word. I U L E T? ""IULET"" not a word.

So no word with both I and L.

We might have to choose one.

Another candidate: what about ""OUNCE""? But C excluded and E in pos5? Not allowed.

""OUTED""? But E in pos4? O-U-T-E-D -> but T is in pos3, not pos5. We need T in pos5. So ""OUTED"" has T in pos3 and D in pos5, not matching.

""UNTIE""? U in pos1? We need U in pos2.

So let's decide on a guess.

I think ""QUIET"" is a good choice because:
- It tests two new common letters: Q and I. But Q is not very common, but I is a vowel and common.
- If we get a ✓ for Q in position1, then we know the word starts with Q and E is in pos4.
- If we get an x for Q, then E must be in pos1 (since if E is in pos4, then position1 must be a letter that is not Q, but we don't know what it is). Actually, if Q is absent, then ""QUIET"" is not the word, and E must be in pos1? Not necessarily: the word could still have E in pos4 and a different letter in pos1, like in ""DUVET"". So we don't directly conclude E must be in pos1 if Q is absent.

Similarly, for I: if I is present, it might be in pos3 or elsewhere? But we don't know.

This might not be efficient.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have E in it? But we know E is in the word, so we must include E to get feedback on its position. If we don't include E, we might get an x for E, but we know it's present, so that would be a wasted guess. So we must include E.

We have to include E.

Another idea: use a word that has E in position4 and tests common letters in the other positions.

For example, ""DUVET"" tests D and V, but V is less common.

Or ""QUIET"" tests Q and I.

But we can try ""BUYET""? Not a word.

""PURET""? Not a word.

""JUMET""? Not a word.

""KUTER""? Not a word.

""LUTEA""? Not a word and A excluded.

""MYTHS""? S excluded.

So limited options.

Perhaps ""EXULT"" is better because it tests X and L, and if it's not correct, we know E is in pos4.

Similarly, if we guess ""EXULT"" and it's not the word, then we know E is in pos4, and we can then guess one of the pos4 options next.

Also, ""EXULT"" uses more common letters than ""QUIET"" with Q? L is more common than Q.

Letter frequency in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... L is 12th, Q is 24th.

So L is better to test.

Moreover, X is less common, but it might help eliminate.

So I think ""EXULT"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see what happens if we guess ""EXULT"":

- If the word is ""EXULT"", we win.

- If not, then we know:
  - E is not in position1, so it must be in position4.
  - Also, we get feedback on X and L: if they are present or not.

But if E is in position4, then the word is _ U _ E T.

And we know from ""EXULT"" feedback:
  - If X is absent, then the first letter is not X and not any excluded.
  - If L is absent, then the word doesn't have L.

Then we can guess ""DUVET"" or ""QUIET"" next.

But we might be able to guess in a way that tests more letters.

Another candidate: what about ""HUTED""? Not a word.

""FUTILE""? 6 letters.

""BUTEO""? B-U-T-E-O -> but T is in position3, not 5. We need T in position5.

So not.

Perhaps we can try ""OUNCE"" but C excluded.

I think ""EXULT"" is a good choice.

But let's consider ""DUVET"". It tests D and V, which are also useful.

But V is less common than L.

Similarly, ""QUIET"" has Q which is rare.

So ""EXULT"" with L is better.

But there's another word: ""ELUTE"". E-L-U-T-E. But that has E in position1 and 5? But position5 is T, not E. And we know E is not in position5. So ""ELUTE"" has E at the end, which is invalid for our use because position5 must be T.

So not.

Therefore, I choose ""EXULT"".

But let's double-check the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""QUIET"":

If secret word is ""QUIET"", and we guess ""EXULT"":
- E: in ""EXULT"" is position1, but in ""QUIET"" E is position4 -> so E should be marked as present but wrong position (-).
- X: not in ""QUIET"" -> absent (x).
- U: in position2 in both -> correct (✓).
- L: not in ""QUIET"" -> absent (x).
- T: in position5 in both -> correct (✓).

So feedback: E(-), X(x), U(✓), L(x), T(✓)

Then we know E is not in pos1 (because we got - for E in pos1), so it must be in pos4. Also, X and L are absent.

Then we can guess a word with E in pos4, U in2, T in5, and avoid X and L, and the other excluded letters.

Possible words: ""QUIET"" or ""DUVET"" or others? But with X and L absent, and we know the word has E in pos4.

So we would guess ""QUIET"" next, and if it's not, then ""DUVET"".

Similarly, if the secret word is ""DUVET"", and we guess ""EXULT"":
- E: in pos1 in guess, but in ""DUVET"" E is pos4 -> (-)
- X: not in ""DUVET"" -> (x)
- U: (✓)
- L: not in ""DUVET"" -> (x)
- T: (✓)

Same feedback as above.

Then we would guess ""QUIET"" or ""DUVET"". If we guess ""QUIET"" and it's not, then we know it's ""DUVET"".

But we have 4 guesses left, so it's manageable.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests multiple options at once, but it's hard.

Another idea: guess a word that has E in position4 and tests two new common letters for positions1 and3.

For example, ""DUVET"" or ""QUIET"", but we don't know which.

Or is there a word like ""HUTED""? Not valid.

""PUKED""? But E in pos4? P-U-K-E-D -> D in pos5, not T. Not matching.

So I think ""EXULT"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""EXULT"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  - **Deductions**:  
    - C, R, A, N are **absent** from the secret word.  
    - E is **present** but not in position 5.  
- **Guess 2: ""guest""** → G(x), U(✓), E(-), S(x), T(✓)  
  - **Deductions**:  
    - G and S are **absent**.  
    - U is **correct and in position 2**.  
    - E is **present but not in position 3** (since it received ""-"").  
    - T is **correct and in position 5**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
   - Position 2: **U** (fixed).  
   - Position 5: **T** (fixed).  
   - E is **present** but **cannot be in positions 3 or 5** (from both guesses). Since position 2 is fixed as U, E must be in **position 1 or 4**.  
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, S (excluded from guesses).  
3. **Unknown positions**:  
   - Position 1: Could be E or a new letter.  
   - Position 3: Must be a new letter (not E, and not absent).  
   - Position 4: Could be E or a new letter.  
4. **Strategy for next guess**:  
   - Must include **E in position 1 or 4** to resolve its location.  
   - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., L, I, D, V) to maximize information.  
   - Avoid absent letters (C, R, A, N, G, S).  
   - Prioritize words that distinguish between E in position 1 vs. 4.  

### Why ""exult""?
- **Structure**: E (position 1), X (position 3), U (position 2, fixed), L (position 4), T (position 5, fixed).  
- **Tests E placement**: Places E in **position 1** (if E is here, it confirms; if not, E must be in position 4).  
- **Tests new letters**:  
  - **X**: Less common, but tests for rare letters.  
  - **L**: High-frequency consonant (12th most common in English), useful for elimination.  
- **Avoids repeats and absent letters**: No reused letters from absent list.  
- **Information gain**:  
  - If E is ✓, the word starts with E.  
  - If E is -, E must be in position 4.  
  - Feedback on X and L will further narrow possibilities (e.g., if both absent, words like ""quiet"" or ""duvet"" become top candidates).  
- **Valid word**: ""Exult"" (meaning to show triumph) fits all constraints.  

<guess>exult</guess>",exult,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.
- E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""guest"" -> G(x), U(✓), E(-), S(x), T(✓)
Meaning:
- G and S are absent.
- U is correct and in position 2 (since in ""guest"", U is the second letter).
- E is present but not in position 3 (because we got a '-' for E in position 3).
- T is correct and in position 5 (since in ""guest"", T is the fifth letter).

So, from the feedback we know:

1. The secret word has the following confirmed:
   - U in position 2.
   - T in position 5.
   - E is present, but not in position 3 or 5 (we already knew not in 5, now also not in 3).

2. The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, G, S.

3. E must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2, 3, and 5 are taken by U, ?, and T, and E cannot be in 3 or 5, and position 2 is U so E can't be there either? Wait, position 2 is fixed as U, so E cannot be in position 2. Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 4).

Let's list the positions:
Position 1: unknown, but E could be here.
Position 2: U (confirmed)
Position 3: unknown, but E is not here (from the '-' in guess2) and it's not any of the excluded letters.
Position 4: unknown, E could be here.
Position 5: T (confirmed)

So the word structure is: [1: ? or E] [2: U] [3: ?] [4: ? or E] [5: T]

But note: E is present, so it must be in either position 1 or 4.

Also, we have excluded letters: C, R, A, N, G, S.

We have 6 tries and this is the third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has U in position 2 and T in position 5.
- Contains the letter E, which must be in position 1 or 4.
- Avoids the letters C, R, A, N, G, S.

Additionally, we want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.

Let's consider the possibilities for E:

Case 1: E in position 1 -> word starts with E, then U in position 2, then an unknown in 3, then unknown in 4, then T.

Case 2: E in position 4 -> then position 1 is not E, and we have: [1: not E] [2: U] [3: ?] [4: E] [5: T]

We also need to fill position 3 and the other position (1 or 4) with letters that are not excluded.

We haven't tested many letters yet. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, G, U, S, T.

But U and T are confirmed, and E is confirmed but not positioned. The others are absent.

So available letters: all except C, R, A, N, G, S (and we know E, U, T are in, but we can use them again? We have to be cautious: the word might have repeated letters? But we don't know. However, to maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters unless necessary. But in this case, we are forced to use E, U, T? Actually, we are required to have U and T in their positions, and E must appear. But we don't have to repeat U or T because they are already placed. We only need to place E and the other two positions.

But note: the word must have exactly the letters we guess? No, we are guessing. We are trying to find the secret word.

But for the guess, we must form a valid word that fits the constraints.

We can try to design a guess that distinguishes between the two cases (E in 1 or 4) and tests new letters.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern:

Pattern: _ U _ _ T

With E in position 1 or 4, and avoiding C,R,A,N,G,S.

First, if E is in position 1: then the word is E U _ _ T.

What can we put in positions 3 and 4? We need two letters that are not excluded and form a valid word.

Possible words: 
- E U C H T? But C is excluded -> invalid.
- E U P H T? EUPHT is not a word.
- E U L E T? But that would have two E's? And E is in position 1 and 4? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, ""EULET"" is not a word.
- E U P L T? Not a word.
- E U L K T? ""ELUKT"" not a word.
- E U D O T? ""EUDOT"" not a word.

Common words: 
- ""EXULT"": but X is not excluded? We haven't tested X. But ""EXULT"" has E in position1, X in 3, U in 2, L in 4, T in 5. But we have excluded S, but not L. So ""EXULT"" is a word? Yes, meaning to show triumph. But note: we have to avoid G and S, but L is not excluded. Also, we haven't tested L. So that's a candidate.

But in ""EXULT"", E is in position1, and we are testing X and L.

Now, if E is in position4: then the word is _ U _ E T.

Possible words:
- B U L E T? ""BULET"" not a word. But ""BULLET"" is 6 letters.
- D U E T? ""DUET"" is 4 letters? No, 4 letters. We need 5 letters.
- M U S E T? But S is excluded -> invalid.
- P U L E T? ""PULET"" not a word. ""PULLET"" is 6.
- Q U I E T? But I is not excluded? ""QUIET"": Q(1), U(2), I(3), E(4), T(5). That's a valid word. And it avoids excluded letters: C,R,A,N,G,S? Q, U, I, E, T. U and T are known, E is known, Q and I are new. But Q is not excluded? We haven't tested Q. So ""QUIET"" is a candidate.

But note: in ""QUIET"", E is in position4, which is one of the possibilities.

Now, we have two candidate words: ""EXULT"" (E in pos1) and ""QUIET"" (E in pos4). But we don't know which one is correct, and we need to guess one.

But we can also think of other words.

Another word for E in pos1: ""EDUCT""? But D is not excluded, but ""EDUCT"" is a word? Meaning something drawn out. But it has C? E-D-U-C-T -> C is excluded -> invalid.

""EVICT""? But C is excluded -> invalid.

""EMPTY""? But M, P, T, Y. T is already in position5? ""EMPTY"": E(1), M(2), P(3), T(4), Y(5). But we need position2 to be U, not M. So that doesn't fit the pattern.

We must have U in position2 and T in position5.

So for E in pos1: ""EXULT"" is a candidate.

For E in pos4: ""QUIET"" is a candidate.

But are there others?

E in pos4: ""SUITE""? But S is excluded -> invalid.

""JUICE""? But C is excluded -> invalid.

""BUYER""? But position5 is T, not R. ""BUYER"" ends with R.

""DUVET""? D-U-V-E-T. That's a word! Meaning a type of quilt. And it has E in position4? D(1), U(2), V(3), E(4), T(5). So that fits. And avoids excluded letters: D, V are new and not excluded.

So ""DUVET"" is another candidate for E in pos4.

Also, ""QUIET"" and ""DUVET"" both have E in pos4.

Now, for E in pos1: ""EXULT"" is one, but are there others?

""EJECT""? C excluded.

""ERUPT""? R excluded.

""ENACT""? N and C excluded.

So ""EXULT"" might be the only common one.

But we also have ""EXPEL""? But P and L, but position5 is T, not L. ""EXPEL"" ends with L.

So ""EXULT"" is a good candidate for E in pos1.

Now, we have two cases, and we need to choose a guess that can help us distinguish and also test new letters.

We can try to guess a word that has E in position1, but then we are assuming that case, or similarly for position4.

But we don't know which case it is. So we should choose a guess that works regardless of where E is, but that tests the position of E and other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in one of the positions and tests the other.

But note: we must have U in position2 and T in position5, and E must be in 1 or 4.

So let's list the positions:

Position 1: must be E or some other letter (if E is in 4)
Position 2: U
Position 3: must be a letter that is not excluded and not E (since E is not in pos3)
Position 4: must be E or some other letter (if E is in 1)
Position 5: T

We need to fill position1,3,4 with the constraints.

We can try to use a word that has E in position1 and a different letter in position4, or vice versa.

But we also want to test new common letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E, but we know it's in, and U,T are fixed).

We should avoid using too many rare letters.

Let's try to form a word:

Option 1: Assume E in position1: then word is E U ? ? T

We need two letters for positions 3 and 4. We can use common letters like L, I, P, etc.

But we already thought of ""EXULT"" with X and L.

Option 2: Assume E in position4: then word is ? U ? E T

We can have ""QUIET"" with Q and I, or ""DUVET"" with D and V.

But we don't know which one is correct.

We could choose a word that doesn't commit to E in 1 or 4 but tests both possibilities? But we have to have E in one of them.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in position1 and tests position4 with a new letter, or vice versa.

But note: we have to make a valid word.

Another idea: use a word that has E in position1 and also tests a common letter in position4, and a common letter in position3.

For example, ""EUROT""? Not a word.

""EIGHT"" but position2 is U, not I.

We must have U in position2.

So let's list possible words:

For E in pos1: 
- EXULT (X in pos3, L in pos4)

For E in pos4:
- QUIET (Q in pos1, I in pos3)
- DUVET (D in pos1, V in pos3)
- Other: ""SUQET""? Not a word. ""CUVET""? C excluded. ""HUTET""? Not a word. ""LUTED""? But D in pos5, not T? ""LUTED"" is L-U-T-E-D, so T in pos3? But we need T in pos5. Not matching.

""PURET""? Not a word. ""JUMET""? Not a word.

""BUTEI""? Not a word.

So the common ones are: EXULT (E in 1), QUIET (E in 4), DUVET (E in 4).

Now, we need to choose one as our guess. But we don't know which pattern is correct.

We can choose ""EXULT"" to test the E-in-pos1 case. If it's correct, we win. If not, we know E must be in pos4.

Similarly, if we choose ""QUIET"" or ""DUVET"", we test E-in-pos4.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's see the letters tested:

- EXULT: tests X and L (and confirms E, U, T positions, but we already know U and T are fixed, and E is present but we are testing its position).
- QUIET: tests Q and I.
- DUVET: tests D and V.

Which letters are more common? I and L are very common, D is common, X and Q are less common.

So perhaps testing I and L is better.

But we can also consider a word that tests both I and L? But we have to fit the pattern.

Is there a word that has U in pos2, T in pos5, E in either 1 or 4, and uses I and L?

For example, if E in pos1: E U ? ? T, and we want I and L. But we have two positions: 3 and 4. So we could have E U I L T? ""EUILT"" not a word. E U L I T? ""ELUIT"" not a word.

If E in pos4: ? U ? E T, and we want I and L. So position1 and 3: I and L? For example, L U I E T? ""LUIET"" not a word. I U L E T? ""IULET"" not a word.

So no word with both I and L.

We might have to choose one.

Another candidate: what about ""OUNCE""? But C excluded and E in pos5? Not allowed.

""OUTED""? But E in pos4? O-U-T-E-D -> but T is in pos3, not pos5. We need T in pos5. So ""OUTED"" has T in pos3 and D in pos5, not matching.

""UNTIE""? U in pos1? We need U in pos2.

So let's decide on a guess.

I think ""QUIET"" is a good choice because:
- It tests two new common letters: Q and I. But Q is not very common, but I is a vowel and common.
- If we get a ✓ for Q in position1, then we know the word starts with Q and E is in pos4.
- If we get an x for Q, then E must be in pos1 (since if E is in pos4, then position1 must be a letter that is not Q, but we don't know what it is). Actually, if Q is absent, then ""QUIET"" is not the word, and E must be in pos1? Not necessarily: the word could still have E in pos4 and a different letter in pos1, like in ""DUVET"". So we don't directly conclude E must be in pos1 if Q is absent.

Similarly, for I: if I is present, it might be in pos3 or elsewhere? But we don't know.

This might not be efficient.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have E in it? But we know E is in the word, so we must include E to get feedback on its position. If we don't include E, we might get an x for E, but we know it's present, so that would be a wasted guess. So we must include E.

We have to include E.

Another idea: use a word that has E in position4 and tests common letters in the other positions.

For example, ""DUVET"" tests D and V, but V is less common.

Or ""QUIET"" tests Q and I.

But we can try ""BUYET""? Not a word.

""PURET""? Not a word.

""JUMET""? Not a word.

""KUTER""? Not a word.

""LUTEA""? Not a word and A excluded.

""MYTHS""? S excluded.

So limited options.

Perhaps ""EXULT"" is better because it tests X and L, and if it's not correct, we know E is in pos4.

Similarly, if we guess ""EXULT"" and it's not the word, then we know E is in pos4, and we can then guess one of the pos4 options next.

Also, ""EXULT"" uses more common letters than ""QUIET"" with Q? L is more common than Q.

Letter frequency in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... L is 12th, Q is 24th.

So L is better to test.

Moreover, X is less common, but it might help eliminate.

So I think ""EXULT"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see what happens if we guess ""EXULT"":

- If the word is ""EXULT"", we win.

- If not, then we know:
  - E is not in position1, so it must be in position4.
  - Also, we get feedback on X and L: if they are present or not.

But if E is in position4, then the word is _ U _ E T.

And we know from ""EXULT"" feedback:
  - If X is absent, then the first letter is not X and not any excluded.
  - If L is absent, then the word doesn't have L.

Then we can guess ""DUVET"" or ""QUIET"" next.

But we might be able to guess in a way that tests more letters.

Another candidate: what about ""HUTED""? Not a word.

""FUTILE""? 6 letters.

""BUTEO""? B-U-T-E-O -> but T is in position3, not 5. We need T in position5.

So not.

Perhaps we can try ""OUNCE"" but C excluded.

I think ""EXULT"" is a good choice.

But let's consider ""DUVET"". It tests D and V, which are also useful.

But V is less common than L.

Similarly, ""QUIET"" has Q which is rare.

So ""EXULT"" with L is better.

But there's another word: ""ELUTE"". E-L-U-T-E. But that has E in position1 and 5? But position5 is T, not E. And we know E is not in position5. So ""ELUTE"" has E at the end, which is invalid for our use because position5 must be T.

So not.

Therefore, I choose ""EXULT"".

But let's double-check the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""QUIET"":

If secret word is ""QUIET"", and we guess ""EXULT"":
- E: in ""EXULT"" is position1, but in ""QUIET"" E is position4 -> so E should be marked as present but wrong position (-).
- X: not in ""QUIET"" -> absent (x).
- U: in position2 in both -> correct (✓).
- L: not in ""QUIET"" -> absent (x).
- T: in position5 in both -> correct (✓).

So feedback: E(-), X(x), U(✓), L(x), T(✓)

Then we know E is not in pos1 (because we got - for E in pos1), so it must be in pos4. Also, X and L are absent.

Then we can guess a word with E in pos4, U in2, T in5, and avoid X and L, and the other excluded letters.

Possible words: ""QUIET"" or ""DUVET"" or others? But with X and L absent, and we know the word has E in pos4.

So we would guess ""QUIET"" next, and if it's not, then ""DUVET"".

Similarly, if the secret word is ""DUVET"", and we guess ""EXULT"":
- E: in pos1 in guess, but in ""DUVET"" E is pos4 -> (-)
- X: not in ""DUVET"" -> (x)
- U: (✓)
- L: not in ""DUVET"" -> (x)
- T: (✓)

Same feedback as above.

Then we would guess ""QUIET"" or ""DUVET"". If we guess ""QUIET"" and it's not, then we know it's ""DUVET"".

But we have 4 guesses left, so it's manageable.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests multiple options at once, but it's hard.

Another idea: guess a word that has E in position4 and tests two new common letters for positions1 and3.

For example, ""DUVET"" or ""QUIET"", but we don't know which.

Or is there a word like ""HUTED""? Not valid.

""PUKED""? But E in pos4? P-U-K-E-D -> D in pos5, not T. Not matching.

So I think ""EXULT"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""EXULT"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, the user is asking me to make my first guess in a Wordle-like game. Since it's the first attempt, I need to choose a strategic starting word that maximizes information gain. 

Hmm... the classic approach is to pick a word with common letters and avoid repeats. Words like ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""ROAST"" are popular openers. ""CRANE"" feels solid - it's got C, R, A, N, E which are all frequent consonants/vowels. 

Wait, I should consider positional frequency too. E is common as the last letter, C often starts words... yeah ""CRANE"" covers good ground. Plus no duplicate letters, so no wasted guesses. 

*checks mental dictionary* Is CRANE valid? Definitely - it's a real word meaning lifting device or long-necked bird. Perfect. 

This'll give clean feedback to narrow down possibilities fast. If I get ✓s/-s on any of these letters, I'll have strong clues for the next guess. 

Alright, locked in: CRANE.After analyzing common Wordle strategies, a strong first guess should maximize letter diversity and cover frequent vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
- Contains three common vowels (A, E) and useful consonants (C, R, N)
- No repeated letters
- Tests vowel positions (A in middle, E at end)
- High-frequency letters provide actionable feedback

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

This means:
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"", E is the last letter).

So the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position. Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, or N.

We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A, N (since they are marked as absent)
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (so E must be in one of the first four positions: 1,2,3,4)

Additionally, we want to maximize information by using common letters that we haven't tested yet. Since we know E is in the word, we can try to place E in a different position and also test other common consonants and vowels.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that the word has an E, so we should include E and avoid the excluded letters.

We can try to use a word that has E in one of the positions 1-4 and uses other common letters.

Let's think of words that have E and avoid C,R,A,N.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: e.g., E _ _ _ _
- Position 2: e.g., _ E _ _ _
- Position 3: e.g., _ _ E _ _
- Position 4: e.g., _ _ _ E _

We also want to test other vowels (like O, I, U) and common consonants.

Since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it's not at the end, we can try to put E in the second position and test other common letters.

A good candidate might be a word like ""BELIE"" but that has repeated E? Also, we don't know if the word has repeated letters. But we should avoid repeats for maximum information.

Alternatively, consider ""BELOW"", but that has E in position 2 and O at the end. However, we don't know if O is in the word.

Another idea: ""SPIEL"" but that has 5 letters? Let me check: S-P-I-E-L -> 5 letters. But E is in position 4? We want to test E in a different position.

We can try to put E in position 1: words like ""EIGHT"" (but has G and H, which are good to test) or ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W).

But note: we haven't tested S, T, L, O, etc. These are common.

Another common starting word is ""TOISE"" but that's not a word. How about ""TILES""? But that doesn't have E? We need E.

We must include E.

Let me list some words that have E and avoid C,R,A,N:

- Position 1: E, then avoid C,R,A,N: e.g., E, then from B,D,F,G,H,... 
  Examples: EGGED (but repeated letters, not ideal), EIGHT, ELBOW, ELSIN (not common), maybe ""EJECT"" but has C? C is excluded. So no.

Better: ""ELBOW"": E (position1), L, B, O, W -> all new letters.

- Position 2: e.g., _ E _ _ _ 
  Words: BELOW, HELLO (but repeated L), JELLY (has L repeated? J-E-L-L-Y -> repeated L). 
  How about ""DEBIT"": D-E-B-I-T -> but we don't have E in position2? Actually, it does: D (1), E (2), B (3), I (4), T (5). But we know E is not in position5, but that doesn't restrict position2. However, we must avoid A (in DEBIT? no A) and C,R,A,N. DEBIT: D, E, B, I, T -> none of the excluded. So that's a candidate.

- Position 3: e.g., _ _ E _ _
  Words: TABLE (but has A? A is excluded) -> invalid. 
  How about ""GUEST"": G-U-E-S-T -> E in position3. Avoids C,R,A,N.

- Position 4: e.g., _ _ _ E _
  Words: MOVIE (M-O-V-I-E -> but E is at the end? position5? we need E not in position5, so position4 is allowed). 
  But MOVIE: M(1),O(2),V(3),I(4),E(5) -> E is in position5, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use E in position5. But position4 is allowed. 
  Example: ""SPIKE"": S-P-I-K-E -> E is in position5? That's the same as last time. We need E not in position5. So we can have E in position4? 
  How about ""SPIEL"": S-P-I-E-L -> E is in position4. That's allowed.

But note: we don't know if the word has repeated letters, but we should avoid them for now to test more letters.

So candidates:
1. ELBOW: E in pos1, tests E,L,B,O,W
2. DEBIT: E in pos2, tests D,E,B,I,T
3. GUEST: E in pos3, tests G,U,E,S,T
4. SPIEL: E in pos4, tests S,P,I,E,L

We want to choose one that uses common letters and might help us narrow down.

Note: We have only one E so far, but the word might have more than one E? The feedback only showed one E (as present but wrong position) and didn't say anything about duplicates. But we don't know. So we should avoid using E twice in our guess to avoid confusion.

All the above candidates have only one E.

Now, which one to pick? We also want to cover vowels. We haven't tested I, O, U. 

In ELBOW: vowels are E and O.
In DEBIT: vowels are E and I.
In GUEST: vowels are U and E.
In SPIEL: vowels are I and E.

All are good.

But we also want to test common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

Let's see the frequency of letters in English 5-letter words:

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.

We haven't tested: S, T, L, D, B, G, H, etc.

In DEBIT: D, B, I, T -> and E. So we test D, B, I, T, E.

In GUEST: G, U, E, S, T -> tests G, U, S, T, E.

In SPIEL: S, P, I, E, L -> tests S, P, I, L, E.

In ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> tests L, B, O, W, E.

We know E is in the word, so we are testing 4 new letters in each.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters (C,R,A,N) and we are.

I think ""DEBIT"" is a good choice because it tests two vowels (E and I) and common consonants (D, B, T). Also, it places E in position2, which we haven't tested.

Alternatively, ""GUEST"" tests S and T which are very common.

But let's consider: we know E is in the word but not at the end. So if we put E in position2, we might get feedback on whether it's in that position or not.

Similarly, we can try to cover more vowels.

Another candidate: ""MEDIA"" but A is excluded -> invalid.

""TOWIE"" not a word? 

""PIOUS"" but no E.

We must have E.

I think ""DEBIT"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if ""DEBIT"" is a valid word: yes, meaning an amount owed.

Alternatively, ""BEIGE"" but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end. ""BEIGE"" has E at the end and at the beginning? B-E-I-G-E -> positions: B(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), E(5). So it has E at position2 and 5. But we know E is not at position5, so we cannot use a word that has E at position5. So ""BEIGE"" would be invalid because it has E at position5? Actually, we can use it? The rule is that the guess must be a valid word, but we are allowed to guess words that have E at the end even if we know it's not there? But it would be inefficient because we already know E is not at the end. So we should avoid putting E at the end to test other positions.

In ""DEBIT"", E is at position2 and no E at the end. So that's good.

Similarly, ""GUEST"" has E at position3 and no E at the end.

""SPIEL"" has E at position4 and no E at the end.

""ELBOW"" has E at position1 and no E at the end.

So all are acceptable.

I think I'll go with ""GUEST"" because it tests S and T which are very common, and U (a vowel) and G.

But let's see the frequency: S and T are more common than B and D? Actually, S is the most common letter, then T.

In ""GUEST"": G, U, E, S, T -> tests S and T.

In ""DEBIT"": D, E, B, I, T -> tests T and D, B.

In ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> tests S and L.

In ""ELBOW"": L, B, O, W -> no S or T.

So ""GUEST"" and ""SPIEL"" test S, which is very common.

But ""GUEST"" also tests T, which is also common.

So ""GUEST"" might be better.

We can also consider ""HOUSE"" but E is at the end -> invalid because we know E is not at the end. So we cannot use words that have E at the end.

Similarly, ""HOMES"" -> E at the end? H-O-M-E-S -> E is at position4? H(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), S(5). So E is at position4, which is allowed. But we don't know if the word has H, O, M, S. But we haven't tested H, O, M, S. So ""HOMES"" is a candidate: H-O-M-E-S.

But we already have E in position4? We don't know if E is in position4 or not, but we can test.

But ""HOMES"" has E in position4 and avoids C,R,A,N.

Similarly, we have many options.

But to maximize new letters, and common ones: S, T, L, O, etc.

I think ""GUEST"" is a good choice because it tests two of the most common consonants (S and T) and a vowel (U) and E in a new position (position3).

So I'll go with ""GUEST"".

But let me confirm: G-U-E-S-T.

Positions: 1: G, 2: U, 3: E, 4: S, 5: T.

We know E is in the word, but not at position5. We are testing E at position3.

If we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at position3. If we get a -, then E is in the word but not at position3 (and not at position5, so it must be at 1,2, or4). If we get an x? But we know E is in the word, so it cannot be x. So for E, we expect either ✓ or -.

Similarly, we test G, U, S, T.

So we get information about these.

Therefore, I choose ""GUEST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- E is **present** but not in the 5th position (marked ""-"" in position 5).

### Key Deductions:
1. The secret word **contains E**, but E cannot be in position 5. It must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
2. The word **excludes** C, R, A, and N entirely.
3. For the next guess:
   - Must include E in position 1–4.
   - Avoid C, R, A, N.
   - Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) to maximize information.

### Strategy for Second Guess:
- **Test E in a new position**: Since E was in position 5 last time, placing it in position 3 (middle) could help triangulate its location.
- **Cover common consonants and vowels**: Focus on untested letters like S, T, G, U, I, O, L, etc. S and T are among the most frequent consonants in English.
- **Avoid repeats**: Use distinct letters to test more possibilities.

Selected ""GUEST"" because:
- Places E in **position 3** (new position to test).
- Tests new high-value letters: **S** (most common letter), **T** (second most common), **G**, and **U** (vowel).
- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.
- Valid 5-letter word (meaning: a visitor or customer).

This guess will provide feedback on:
- Whether E is correctly placed at position 3 (✓), or if it's elsewhere (-).
- Presence/absence of S, T, G, and U, helping narrow the word list significantly.

<guess>guest</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: guest -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(✓) E(-) S(x) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.
- E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""guest"" -> G(x), U(✓), E(-), S(x), T(✓)
Meaning:
- G and S are absent.
- U is correct and in position 2 (since in ""guest"", U is the second letter).
- E is present but not in position 3 (because we got a '-' for E in position 3).
- T is correct and in position 5 (since in ""guest"", T is the fifth letter).

So, from the feedback we know:

1. The secret word has the following confirmed:
   - U in position 2.
   - T in position 5.
   - E is present, but not in position 3 or 5 (we already knew not in 5, now also not in 3).

2. The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, G, S.

3. E must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2, 3, and 5 are taken by U, ?, and T, and E cannot be in 3 or 5, and position 2 is U so E can't be there either? Wait, position 2 is fixed as U, so E cannot be in position 2. Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 4).

Let's list the positions:
Position 1: unknown, but E could be here.
Position 2: U (confirmed)
Position 3: unknown, but E is not here (from the '-' in guess2) and it's not any of the excluded letters.
Position 4: unknown, E could be here.
Position 5: T (confirmed)

So the word structure is: [1: ? or E] [2: U] [3: ?] [4: ? or E] [5: T]

But note: E is present, so it must be in either position 1 or 4.

Also, we have excluded letters: C, R, A, N, G, S.

We have 6 tries and this is the third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has U in position 2 and T in position 5.
- Contains the letter E, which must be in position 1 or 4.
- Avoids the letters C, R, A, N, G, S.

Additionally, we want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.

Let's consider the possibilities for E:

Case 1: E in position 1 -> word starts with E, then U in position 2, then an unknown in 3, then unknown in 4, then T.

Case 2: E in position 4 -> then position 1 is not E, and we have: [1: not E] [2: U] [3: ?] [4: E] [5: T]

We also need to fill position 3 and the other position (1 or 4) with letters that are not excluded.

We haven't tested many letters yet. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, G, U, S, T.

But U and T are confirmed, and E is confirmed but not positioned. The others are absent.

So available letters: all except C, R, A, N, G, S (and we know E, U, T are in, but we can use them again? We have to be cautious: the word might have repeated letters? But we don't know. However, to maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters unless necessary. But in this case, we are forced to use E, U, T? Actually, we are required to have U and T in their positions, and E must appear. But we don't have to repeat U or T because they are already placed. We only need to place E and the other two positions.

But note: the word must have exactly the letters we guess? No, we are guessing. We are trying to find the secret word.

But for the guess, we must form a valid word that fits the constraints.

We can try to design a guess that distinguishes between the two cases (E in 1 or 4) and tests new letters.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern:

Pattern: _ U _ _ T

With E in position 1 or 4, and avoiding C,R,A,N,G,S.

First, if E is in position 1: then the word is E U _ _ T.

What can we put in positions 3 and 4? We need two letters that are not excluded and form a valid word.

Possible words: 
- E U C H T? But C is excluded -> invalid.
- E U P H T? EUPHT is not a word.
- E U L E T? But that would have two E's? And E is in position 1 and 4? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, ""EULET"" is not a word.
- E U P L T? Not a word.
- E U L K T? ""ELUKT"" not a word.
- E U D O T? ""EUDOT"" not a word.

Common words: 
- ""EXULT"": but X is not excluded? We haven't tested X. But ""EXULT"" has E in position1, X in 3, U in 2, L in 4, T in 5. But we have excluded S, but not L. So ""EXULT"" is a word? Yes, meaning to show triumph. But note: we have to avoid G and S, but L is not excluded. Also, we haven't tested L. So that's a candidate.

But in ""EXULT"", E is in position1, and we are testing X and L.

Now, if E is in position4: then the word is _ U _ E T.

Possible words:
- B U L E T? ""BULET"" not a word. But ""BULLET"" is 6 letters.
- D U E T? ""DUET"" is 4 letters? No, 4 letters. We need 5 letters.
- M U S E T? But S is excluded -> invalid.
- P U L E T? ""PULET"" not a word. ""PULLET"" is 6.
- Q U I E T? But I is not excluded? ""QUIET"": Q(1), U(2), I(3), E(4), T(5). That's a valid word. And it avoids excluded letters: C,R,A,N,G,S? Q, U, I, E, T. U and T are known, E is known, Q and I are new. But Q is not excluded? We haven't tested Q. So ""QUIET"" is a candidate.

But note: in ""QUIET"", E is in position4, which is one of the possibilities.

Now, we have two candidate words: ""EXULT"" (E in pos1) and ""QUIET"" (E in pos4). But we don't know which one is correct, and we need to guess one.

But we can also think of other words.

Another word for E in pos1: ""EDUCT""? But D is not excluded, but ""EDUCT"" is a word? Meaning something drawn out. But it has C? E-D-U-C-T -> C is excluded -> invalid.

""EVICT""? But C is excluded -> invalid.

""EMPTY""? But M, P, T, Y. T is already in position5? ""EMPTY"": E(1), M(2), P(3), T(4), Y(5). But we need position2 to be U, not M. So that doesn't fit the pattern.

We must have U in position2 and T in position5.

So for E in pos1: ""EXULT"" is a candidate.

For E in pos4: ""QUIET"" is a candidate.

But are there others?

E in pos4: ""SUITE""? But S is excluded -> invalid.

""JUICE""? But C is excluded -> invalid.

""BUYER""? But position5 is T, not R. ""BUYER"" ends with R.

""DUVET""? D-U-V-E-T. That's a word! Meaning a type of quilt. And it has E in position4? D(1), U(2), V(3), E(4), T(5). So that fits. And avoids excluded letters: D, V are new and not excluded.

So ""DUVET"" is another candidate for E in pos4.

Also, ""QUIET"" and ""DUVET"" both have E in pos4.

Now, for E in pos1: ""EXULT"" is one, but are there others?

""EJECT""? C excluded.

""ERUPT""? R excluded.

""ENACT""? N and C excluded.

So ""EXULT"" might be the only common one.

But we also have ""EXPEL""? But P and L, but position5 is T, not L. ""EXPEL"" ends with L.

So ""EXULT"" is a good candidate for E in pos1.

Now, we have two cases, and we need to choose a guess that can help us distinguish and also test new letters.

We can try to guess a word that has E in position1, but then we are assuming that case, or similarly for position4.

But we don't know which case it is. So we should choose a guess that works regardless of where E is, but that tests the position of E and other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in one of the positions and tests the other.

But note: we must have U in position2 and T in position5, and E must be in 1 or 4.

So let's list the positions:

Position 1: must be E or some other letter (if E is in 4)
Position 2: U
Position 3: must be a letter that is not excluded and not E (since E is not in pos3)
Position 4: must be E or some other letter (if E is in 1)
Position 5: T

We need to fill position1,3,4 with the constraints.

We can try to use a word that has E in position1 and a different letter in position4, or vice versa.

But we also want to test new common letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E, but we know it's in, and U,T are fixed).

We should avoid using too many rare letters.

Let's try to form a word:

Option 1: Assume E in position1: then word is E U ? ? T

We need two letters for positions 3 and 4. We can use common letters like L, I, P, etc.

But we already thought of ""EXULT"" with X and L.

Option 2: Assume E in position4: then word is ? U ? E T

We can have ""QUIET"" with Q and I, or ""DUVET"" with D and V.

But we don't know which one is correct.

We could choose a word that doesn't commit to E in 1 or 4 but tests both possibilities? But we have to have E in one of them.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in position1 and tests position4 with a new letter, or vice versa.

But note: we have to make a valid word.

Another idea: use a word that has E in position1 and also tests a common letter in position4, and a common letter in position3.

For example, ""EUROT""? Not a word.

""EIGHT"" but position2 is U, not I.

We must have U in position2.

So let's list possible words:

For E in pos1: 
- EXULT (X in pos3, L in pos4)

For E in pos4:
- QUIET (Q in pos1, I in pos3)
- DUVET (D in pos1, V in pos3)
- Other: ""SUQET""? Not a word. ""CUVET""? C excluded. ""HUTET""? Not a word. ""LUTED""? But D in pos5, not T? ""LUTED"" is L-U-T-E-D, so T in pos3? But we need T in pos5. Not matching.

""PURET""? Not a word. ""JUMET""? Not a word.

""BUTEI""? Not a word.

So the common ones are: EXULT (E in 1), QUIET (E in 4), DUVET (E in 4).

Now, we need to choose one as our guess. But we don't know which pattern is correct.

We can choose ""EXULT"" to test the E-in-pos1 case. If it's correct, we win. If not, we know E must be in pos4.

Similarly, if we choose ""QUIET"" or ""DUVET"", we test E-in-pos4.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's see the letters tested:

- EXULT: tests X and L (and confirms E, U, T positions, but we already know U and T are fixed, and E is present but we are testing its position).
- QUIET: tests Q and I.
- DUVET: tests D and V.

Which letters are more common? I and L are very common, D is common, X and Q are less common.

So perhaps testing I and L is better.

But we can also consider a word that tests both I and L? But we have to fit the pattern.

Is there a word that has U in pos2, T in pos5, E in either 1 or 4, and uses I and L?

For example, if E in pos1: E U ? ? T, and we want I and L. But we have two positions: 3 and 4. So we could have E U I L T? ""EUILT"" not a word. E U L I T? ""ELUIT"" not a word.

If E in pos4: ? U ? E T, and we want I and L. So position1 and 3: I and L? For example, L U I E T? ""LUIET"" not a word. I U L E T? ""IULET"" not a word.

So no word with both I and L.

We might have to choose one.

Another candidate: what about ""OUNCE""? But C excluded and E in pos5? Not allowed.

""OUTED""? But E in pos4? O-U-T-E-D -> but T is in pos3, not pos5. We need T in pos5. So ""OUTED"" has T in pos3 and D in pos5, not matching.

""UNTIE""? U in pos1? We need U in pos2.

So let's decide on a guess.

I think ""QUIET"" is a good choice because:
- It tests two new common letters: Q and I. But Q is not very common, but I is a vowel and common.
- If we get a ✓ for Q in position1, then we know the word starts with Q and E is in pos4.
- If we get an x for Q, then E must be in pos1 (since if E is in pos4, then position1 must be a letter that is not Q, but we don't know what it is). Actually, if Q is absent, then ""QUIET"" is not the word, and E must be in pos1? Not necessarily: the word could still have E in pos4 and a different letter in pos1, like in ""DUVET"". So we don't directly conclude E must be in pos1 if Q is absent.

Similarly, for I: if I is present, it might be in pos3 or elsewhere? But we don't know.

This might not be efficient.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have E in it? But we know E is in the word, so we must include E to get feedback on its position. If we don't include E, we might get an x for E, but we know it's present, so that would be a wasted guess. So we must include E.

We have to include E.

Another idea: use a word that has E in position4 and tests common letters in the other positions.

For example, ""DUVET"" tests D and V, but V is less common.

Or ""QUIET"" tests Q and I.

But we can try ""BUYET""? Not a word.

""PURET""? Not a word.

""JUMET""? Not a word.

""KUTER""? Not a word.

""LUTEA""? Not a word and A excluded.

""MYTHS""? S excluded.

So limited options.

Perhaps ""EXULT"" is better because it tests X and L, and if it's not correct, we know E is in pos4.

Similarly, if we guess ""EXULT"" and it's not the word, then we know E is in pos4, and we can then guess one of the pos4 options next.

Also, ""EXULT"" uses more common letters than ""QUIET"" with Q? L is more common than Q.

Letter frequency in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... L is 12th, Q is 24th.

So L is better to test.

Moreover, X is less common, but it might help eliminate.

So I think ""EXULT"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see what happens if we guess ""EXULT"":

- If the word is ""EXULT"", we win.

- If not, then we know:
  - E is not in position1, so it must be in position4.
  - Also, we get feedback on X and L: if they are present or not.

But if E is in position4, then the word is _ U _ E T.

And we know from ""EXULT"" feedback:
  - If X is absent, then the first letter is not X and not any excluded.
  - If L is absent, then the word doesn't have L.

Then we can guess ""DUVET"" or ""QUIET"" next.

But we might be able to guess in a way that tests more letters.

Another candidate: what about ""HUTED""? Not a word.

""FUTILE""? 6 letters.

""BUTEO""? B-U-T-E-O -> but T is in position3, not 5. We need T in position5.

So not.

Perhaps we can try ""OUNCE"" but C excluded.

I think ""EXULT"" is a good choice.

But let's consider ""DUVET"". It tests D and V, which are also useful.

But V is less common than L.

Similarly, ""QUIET"" has Q which is rare.

So ""EXULT"" with L is better.

But there's another word: ""ELUTE"". E-L-U-T-E. But that has E in position1 and 5? But position5 is T, not E. And we know E is not in position5. So ""ELUTE"" has E at the end, which is invalid for our use because position5 must be T.

So not.

Therefore, I choose ""EXULT"".

But let's double-check the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""QUIET"":

If secret word is ""QUIET"", and we guess ""EXULT"":
- E: in ""EXULT"" is position1, but in ""QUIET"" E is position4 -> so E should be marked as present but wrong position (-).
- X: not in ""QUIET"" -> absent (x).
- U: in position2 in both -> correct (✓).
- L: not in ""QUIET"" -> absent (x).
- T: in position5 in both -> correct (✓).

So feedback: E(-), X(x), U(✓), L(x), T(✓)

Then we know E is not in pos1 (because we got - for E in pos1), so it must be in pos4. Also, X and L are absent.

Then we can guess a word with E in pos4, U in2, T in5, and avoid X and L, and the other excluded letters.

Possible words: ""QUIET"" or ""DUVET"" or others? But with X and L absent, and we know the word has E in pos4.

So we would guess ""QUIET"" next, and if it's not, then ""DUVET"".

Similarly, if the secret word is ""DUVET"", and we guess ""EXULT"":
- E: in pos1 in guess, but in ""DUVET"" E is pos4 -> (-)
- X: not in ""DUVET"" -> (x)
- U: (✓)
- L: not in ""DUVET"" -> (x)
- T: (✓)

Same feedback as above.

Then we would guess ""QUIET"" or ""DUVET"". If we guess ""QUIET"" and it's not, then we know it's ""DUVET"".

But we have 4 guesses left, so it's manageable.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests multiple options at once, but it's hard.

Another idea: guess a word that has E in position4 and tests two new common letters for positions1 and3.

For example, ""DUVET"" or ""QUIET"", but we don't know which.

Or is there a word like ""HUTED""? Not valid.

""PUKED""? But E in pos4? P-U-K-E-D -> D in pos5, not T. Not matching.

So I think ""EXULT"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""EXULT"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  - **Deductions**:  
    - C, R, A, N are **absent** from the secret word.  
    - E is **present** but not in position 5.  
- **Guess 2: ""guest""** → G(x), U(✓), E(-), S(x), T(✓)  
  - **Deductions**:  
    - G and S are **absent**.  
    - U is **correct and in position 2**.  
    - E is **present but not in position 3** (since it received ""-"").  
    - T is **correct and in position 5**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
   - Position 2: **U** (fixed).  
   - Position 5: **T** (fixed).  
   - E is **present** but **cannot be in positions 3 or 5** (from both guesses). Since position 2 is fixed as U, E must be in **position 1 or 4**.  
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, S (excluded from guesses).  
3. **Unknown positions**:  
   - Position 1: Could be E or a new letter.  
   - Position 3: Must be a new letter (not E, and not absent).  
   - Position 4: Could be E or a new letter.  
4. **Strategy for next guess**:  
   - Must include **E in position 1 or 4** to resolve its location.  
   - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., L, I, D, V) to maximize information.  
   - Avoid absent letters (C, R, A, N, G, S).  
   - Prioritize words that distinguish between E in position 1 vs. 4.  

### Why ""exult""?
- **Structure**: E (position 1), X (position 3), U (position 2, fixed), L (position 4), T (position 5, fixed).  
- **Tests E placement**: Places E in **position 1** (if E is here, it confirms; if not, E must be in position 4).  
- **Tests new letters**:  
  - **X**: Less common, but tests for rare letters.  
  - **L**: High-frequency consonant (12th most common in English), useful for elimination.  
- **Avoids repeats and absent letters**: No reused letters from absent list.  
- **Information gain**:  
  - If E is ✓, the word starts with E.  
  - If E is -, E must be in position 4.  
  - Feedback on X and L will further narrow possibilities (e.g., if both absent, words like ""quiet"" or ""duvet"" become top candidates).  
- **Valid word**: ""Exult"" (meaning to show triumph) fits all constraints.

Since it\'s the first attempt, I need to choose a strategic starting word that maximizes information gain. \n\nHmm... the classic approach is to pick a word with common letters and avoid repeats. Words like ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""ROAST"" are popular openers. ""CRANE"" feels solid - it\'s got C, R, A, N, E which are all frequent consonants/vowels. \n\nWait, I should consider positional frequency too. E is common as the last letter, C often starts words... yeah ""CRANE"" covers good ground. Plus no duplicate letters, so no wasted guesses. \n\n*checks mental dictionary* Is CRANE valid? Definitely - it\'s a real word meaning lifting device or long-necked bird. Perfect. \n\nThis\'ll give clean feedback to narrow down possibilities fast. If I get ✓s/-s on any of these letters, I\'ll have strong clues for the next guess. \n\nAlright, locked in: CRANE.After analyzing common Wordle strategies, a strong first guess should maximize letter diversity and cover frequent vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is ideal because:\n- Contains three common vowels (A, E) and useful consonants (C, R, N)\n- No repeated letters\n- Tests vowel positions (A in middle, E at end)\n- High-frequency letters provide actionable feedback\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": \nC(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n\nThis means:\n- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.\n- E is in the word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"", E is the last letter).\n\nSo the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position. Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, or N.\n\nWe have 6 tries and this is the second guess.\n\nWe need to form a new 5-letter word that:\n- Does not contain C, R, A, N (since they are marked as absent)\n- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (so E must be in one of the first four positions: 1,2,3,4)\n\nAdditionally, we want to maximize information by using common letters that we haven\'t tested yet. Since we know E is in the word, we can try to place E in a different position and also test other common consonants and vowels.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we also know that the word has an E, so we should include E and avoid the excluded letters.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has E in one of the positions 1-4 and uses other common letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have E and avoid C,R,A,N.\n\nPossible positions for E:\n- Position 1: e.g., E _ _ _ _\n- Position 2: e.g., _ E _ _ _\n- Position 3: e.g., _ _ E _ _\n- Position 4: e.g., _ _ _ E _\n\nWe also want to test other vowels (like O, I, U) and common consonants.\n\nSince we have only one known letter (E) and we know it\'s not at the end, we can try to put E in the second position and test other common letters.\n\nA good candidate might be a word like ""BELIE"" but that has repeated E? Also, we don\'t know if the word has repeated letters. But we should avoid repeats for maximum information.\n\nAlternatively, consider ""BELOW"", but that has E in position 2 and O at the end. However, we don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\nAnother idea: ""SPIEL"" but that has 5 letters? Let me check: S-P-I-E-L -> 5 letters. But E is in position 4? We want to test E in a different position.\n\nWe can try to put E in position 1: words like ""EIGHT"" (but has G and H, which are good to test) or ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W).\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested S, T, L, O, etc. These are common.\n\nAnother common starting word is ""TOISE"" but that\'s not a word. How about ""TILES""? But that doesn\'t have E? We need E.\n\nWe must include E.\n\nLet me list some words that have E and avoid C,R,A,N:\n\n- Position 1: E, then avoid C,R,A,N: e.g., E, then from B,D,F,G,H,... \n  Examples: EGGED (but repeated letters, not ideal), EIGHT, ELBOW, ELSIN (not common), maybe ""EJECT"" but has C? C is excluded. So no.\n\nBetter: ""ELBOW"": E (position1), L, B, O, W -> all new letters.\n\n- Position 2: e.g., _ E _ _ _ \n  Words: BELOW, HELLO (but repeated L), JELLY (has L repeated? J-E-L-L-Y -> repeated L). \n  How about ""DEBIT"": D-E-B-I-T -> but we don\'t have E in position2? Actually, it does: D (1), E (2), B (3), I (4), T (5). But we know E is not in position5, but that doesn\'t restrict position2. However, we must avoid A (in DEBIT? no A) and C,R,A,N. DEBIT: D, E, B, I, T -> none of the excluded. So that\'s a candidate.\n\n- Position 3: e.g., _ _ E _ _\n  Words: TABLE (but has A? A is excluded) -> invalid. \n  How about ""GUEST"": G-U-E-S-T -> E in position3. Avoids C,R,A,N.\n\n- Position 4: e.g., _ _ _ E _\n  Words: MOVIE (M-O-V-I-E -> but E is at the end? position5? we need E not in position5, so position4 is allowed). \n  But MOVIE: M(1),O(2),V(3),I(4),E(5) -> E is in position5, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use E in position5. But position4 is allowed. \n  Example: ""SPIKE"": S-P-I-K-E -> E is in position5? That\'s the same as last time. We need E not in position5. So we can have E in position4? \n  How about ""SPIEL"": S-P-I-E-L -> E is in position4. That\'s allowed.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has repeated letters, but we should avoid them for now to test more letters.\n\nSo candidates:\n1. ELBOW: E in pos1, tests E,L,B,O,W\n2. DEBIT: E in pos2, tests D,E,B,I,T\n3. GUEST: E in pos3, tests G,U,E,S,T\n4. SPIEL: E in pos4, tests S,P,I,E,L\n\nWe want to choose one that uses common letters and might help us narrow down.\n\nNote: We have only one E so far, but the word might have more than one E? The feedback only showed one E (as present but wrong position) and didn\'t say anything about duplicates. But we don\'t know. So we should avoid using E twice in our guess to avoid confusion.\n\nAll the above candidates have only one E.\n\nNow, which one to pick? We also want to cover vowels. We haven\'t tested I, O, U. \n\nIn ELBOW: vowels are E and O.\nIn DEBIT: vowels are E and I.\nIn GUEST: vowels are U and E.\nIn SPIEL: vowels are I and E.\n\nAll are good.\n\nBut we also want to test common consonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\nLet\'s see the frequency of letters in English 5-letter words:\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: S, T, L, D, B, G, H, etc.\n\nIn DEBIT: D, B, I, T -> and E. So we test D, B, I, T, E.\n\nIn GUEST: G, U, E, S, T -> tests G, U, S, T, E.\n\nIn SPIEL: S, P, I, E, L -> tests S, P, I, L, E.\n\nIn ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> tests L, B, O, W, E.\n\nWe know E is in the word, so we are testing 4 new letters in each.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters (C,R,A,N) and we are.\n\nI think ""DEBIT"" is a good choice because it tests two vowels (E and I) and common consonants (D, B, T). Also, it places E in position2, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nAlternatively, ""GUEST"" tests S and T which are very common.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we know E is in the word but not at the end. So if we put E in position2, we might get feedback on whether it\'s in that position or not.\n\nSimilarly, we can try to cover more vowels.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MEDIA"" but A is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""TOWIE"" not a word? \n\n""PIOUS"" but no E.\n\nWe must have E.\n\nI think ""DEBIT"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me check if ""DEBIT"" is a valid word: yes, meaning an amount owed.\n\nAlternatively, ""BEIGE"" but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end. ""BEIGE"" has E at the end and at the beginning? B-E-I-G-E -> positions: B(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), E(5). So it has E at position2 and 5. But we know E is not at position5, so we cannot use a word that has E at position5. So ""BEIGE"" would be invalid because it has E at position5? Actually, we can use it? The rule is that the guess must be a valid word, but we are allowed to guess words that have E at the end even if we know it\'s not there? But it would be inefficient because we already know E is not at the end. So we should avoid putting E at the end to test other positions.\n\nIn ""DEBIT"", E is at position2 and no E at the end. So that\'s good.\n\nSimilarly, ""GUEST"" has E at position3 and no E at the end.\n\n""SPIEL"" has E at position4 and no E at the end.\n\n""ELBOW"" has E at position1 and no E at the end.\n\nSo all are acceptable.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""GUEST"" because it tests S and T which are very common, and U (a vowel) and G.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: S and T are more common than B and D? Actually, S is the most common letter, then T.\n\nIn ""GUEST"": G, U, E, S, T -> tests S and T.\n\nIn ""DEBIT"": D, E, B, I, T -> tests T and D, B.\n\nIn ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> tests S and L.\n\nIn ""ELBOW"": L, B, O, W -> no S or T.\n\nSo ""GUEST"" and ""SPIEL"" test S, which is very common.\n\nBut ""GUEST"" also tests T, which is also common.\n\nSo ""GUEST"" might be better.\n\nWe can also consider ""HOUSE"" but E is at the end -> invalid because we know E is not at the end. So we cannot use words that have E at the end.\n\nSimilarly, ""HOMES"" -> E at the end? H-O-M-E-S -> E is at position4? H(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), S(5). So E is at position4, which is allowed. But we don\'t know if the word has H, O, M, S. But we haven\'t tested H, O, M, S. So ""HOMES"" is a candidate: H-O-M-E-S.\n\nBut we already have E in position4? We don\'t know if E is in position4 or not, but we can test.\n\nBut ""HOMES"" has E in position4 and avoids C,R,A,N.\n\nSimilarly, we have many options.\n\nBut to maximize new letters, and common ones: S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nI think ""GUEST"" is a good choice because it tests two of the most common consonants (S and T) and a vowel (U) and E in a new position (position3).\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""GUEST"".\n\nBut let me confirm: G-U-E-S-T.\n\nPositions: 1: G, 2: U, 3: E, 4: S, 5: T.\n\nWe know E is in the word, but not at position5. We are testing E at position3.\n\nIf we get a ✓ for E, then we know E is at position3. If we get a -, then E is in the word but not at position3 (and not at position5, so it must be at 1,2, or4). If we get an x? But we know E is in the word, so it cannot be x. So for E, we expect either ✓ or -.\n\nSimilarly, we test G, U, S, T.\n\nSo we get information about these.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""GUEST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- E is **present** but not in the 5th position (marked ""-"" in position 5).\n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. The secret word **contains E**, but E cannot be in position 5. It must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n2. The word **excludes** C, R, A, and N entirely.\n3. For the next guess:\n   - Must include E in position 1–4.\n   - Avoid C, R, A, N.\n   - Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O) to maximize information.\n\n### Strategy for Second Guess:\n- **Test E in a new position**: Since E was in position 5 last time, placing it in position 3 (middle) could help triangulate its location.\n- **Cover common consonants and vowels**: Focus on untested letters like S, T, G, U, I, O, L, etc. S and T are among the most frequent consonants in English.\n- **Avoid repeats**: Use distinct letters to test more possibilities.\n\nSelected ""GUEST"" because:\n- Places E in **position 3** (new position to test).\n- Tests new high-value letters: **S** (most common letter), **T** (second most common), **G**, and **U** (vowel).\n- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.\n- Valid 5-letter word (meaning: a visitor or customer).\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on:\n- Whether E is correctly placed at position 3 (✓), or if it\'s elsewhere (-).\n- Presence/absence of S, T, G, and U, helping narrow the word list significantly.\n\n<guess>guest</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: guest -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(✓) E(-) S(x) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.\n- E is present but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""guest"" -> G(x), U(✓), E(-), S(x), T(✓)\nMeaning:\n- G and S are absent.\n- U is correct and in position 2 (since in ""guest"", U is the second letter).\n- E is present but not in position 3 (because we got a \'-\' for E in position 3).\n- T is correct and in position 5 (since in ""guest"", T is the fifth letter).\n\nSo, from the feedback we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the following confirmed:\n   - U in position 2.\n   - T in position 5.\n   - E is present, but not in position 3 or 5 (we already knew not in 5, now also not in 3).\n\n2. The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, G, S.\n\n3. E must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2, 3, and 5 are taken by U, ?, and T, and E cannot be in 3 or 5, and position 2 is U so E can\'t be there either? Wait, position 2 is fixed as U, so E cannot be in position 2. Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 4).\n\nLet\'s list the positions:\nPosition 1: unknown, but E could be here.\nPosition 2: U (confirmed)\nPosition 3: unknown, but E is not here (from the \'-\' in guess2) and it\'s not any of the excluded letters.\nPosition 4: unknown, E could be here.\nPosition 5: T (confirmed)\n\nSo the word structure is: [1: ? or E] [2: U] [3: ?] [4: ? or E] [5: T]\n\nBut note: E is present, so it must be in either position 1 or 4.\n\nAlso, we have excluded letters: C, R, A, N, G, S.\n\nWe have 6 tries and this is the third guess.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Has U in position 2 and T in position 5.\n- Contains the letter E, which must be in position 1 or 4.\n- Avoids the letters C, R, A, N, G, S.\n\nAdditionally, we want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.\n\nLet\'s consider the possibilities for E:\n\nCase 1: E in position 1 -> word starts with E, then U in position 2, then an unknown in 3, then unknown in 4, then T.\n\nCase 2: E in position 4 -> then position 1 is not E, and we have: [1: not E] [2: U] [3: ?] [4: E] [5: T]\n\nWe also need to fill position 3 and the other position (1 or 4) with letters that are not excluded.\n\nWe haven\'t tested many letters yet. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, G, U, S, T.\n\nBut U and T are confirmed, and E is confirmed but not positioned. The others are absent.\n\nSo available letters: all except C, R, A, N, G, S (and we know E, U, T are in, but we can use them again? We have to be cautious: the word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t know. However, to maximize information, we should avoid repeating letters unless necessary. But in this case, we are forced to use E, U, T? Actually, we are required to have U and T in their positions, and E must appear. But we don\'t have to repeat U or T because they are already placed. We only need to place E and the other two positions.\n\nBut note: the word must have exactly the letters we guess? No, we are guessing. We are trying to find the secret word.\n\nBut for the guess, we must form a valid word that fits the constraints.\n\nWe can try to design a guess that distinguishes between the two cases (E in 1 or 4) and tests new letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern:\n\nPattern: _ U _ _ T\n\nWith E in position 1 or 4, and avoiding C,R,A,N,G,S.\n\nFirst, if E is in position 1: then the word is E U _ _ T.\n\nWhat can we put in positions 3 and 4? We need two letters that are not excluded and form a valid word.\n\nPossible words: \n- E U C H T? But C is excluded -> invalid.\n- E U P H T? EUPHT is not a word.\n- E U L E T? But that would have two E\'s? And E is in position 1 and 4? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, ""EULET"" is not a word.\n- E U P L T? Not a word.\n- E U L K T? ""ELUKT"" not a word.\n- E U D O T? ""EUDOT"" not a word.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""EXULT"": but X is not excluded? We haven\'t tested X. But ""EXULT"" has E in position1, X in 3, U in 2, L in 4, T in 5. But we have excluded S, but not L. So ""EXULT"" is a word? Yes, meaning to show triumph. But note: we have to avoid G and S, but L is not excluded. Also, we haven\'t tested L. So that\'s a candidate.\n\nBut in ""EXULT"", E is in position1, and we are testing X and L.\n\nNow, if E is in position4: then the word is _ U _ E T.\n\nPossible words:\n- B U L E T? ""BULET"" not a word. But ""BULLET"" is 6 letters.\n- D U E T? ""DUET"" is 4 letters? No, 4 letters. We need 5 letters.\n- M U S E T? But S is excluded -> invalid.\n- P U L E T? ""PULET"" not a word. ""PULLET"" is 6.\n- Q U I E T? But I is not excluded? ""QUIET"": Q(1), U(2), I(3), E(4), T(5). That\'s a valid word. And it avoids excluded letters: C,R,A,N,G,S? Q, U, I, E, T. U and T are known, E is known, Q and I are new. But Q is not excluded? We haven\'t tested Q. So ""QUIET"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: in ""QUIET"", E is in position4, which is one of the possibilities.\n\nNow, we have two candidate words: ""EXULT"" (E in pos1) and ""QUIET"" (E in pos4). But we don\'t know which one is correct, and we need to guess one.\n\nBut we can also think of other words.\n\nAnother word for E in pos1: ""EDUCT""? But D is not excluded, but ""EDUCT"" is a word? Meaning something drawn out. But it has C? E-D-U-C-T -> C is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""EVICT""? But C is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""EMPTY""? But M, P, T, Y. T is already in position5? ""EMPTY"": E(1), M(2), P(3), T(4), Y(5). But we need position2 to be U, not M. So that doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nWe must have U in position2 and T in position5.\n\nSo for E in pos1: ""EXULT"" is a candidate.\n\nFor E in pos4: ""QUIET"" is a candidate.\n\nBut are there others?\n\nE in pos4: ""SUITE""? But S is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""JUICE""? But C is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""BUYER""? But position5 is T, not R. ""BUYER"" ends with R.\n\n""DUVET""? D-U-V-E-T. That\'s a word! Meaning a type of quilt. And it has E in position4? D(1), U(2), V(3), E(4), T(5). So that fits. And avoids excluded letters: D, V are new and not excluded.\n\nSo ""DUVET"" is another candidate for E in pos4.\n\nAlso, ""QUIET"" and ""DUVET"" both have E in pos4.\n\nNow, for E in pos1: ""EXULT"" is one, but are there others?\n\n""EJECT""? C excluded.\n\n""ERUPT""? R excluded.\n\n""ENACT""? N and C excluded.\n\nSo ""EXULT"" might be the only common one.\n\nBut we also have ""EXPEL""? But P and L, but position5 is T, not L. ""EXPEL"" ends with L.\n\nSo ""EXULT"" is a good candidate for E in pos1.\n\nNow, we have two cases, and we need to choose a guess that can help us distinguish and also test new letters.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has E in position1, but then we are assuming that case, or similarly for position4.\n\nBut we don\'t know which case it is. So we should choose a guess that works regardless of where E is, but that tests the position of E and other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has E in one of the positions and tests the other.\n\nBut note: we must have U in position2 and T in position5, and E must be in 1 or 4.\n\nSo let\'s list the positions:\n\nPosition 1: must be E or some other letter (if E is in 4)\nPosition 2: U\nPosition 3: must be a letter that is not excluded and not E (since E is not in pos3)\nPosition 4: must be E or some other letter (if E is in 1)\nPosition 5: T\n\nWe need to fill position1,3,4 with the constraints.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has E in position1 and a different letter in position4, or vice versa.\n\nBut we also want to test new common letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E, but we know it\'s in, and U,T are fixed).\n\nWe should avoid using too many rare letters.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word:\n\nOption 1: Assume E in position1: then word is E U ? ? T\n\nWe need two letters for positions 3 and 4. We can use common letters like L, I, P, etc.\n\nBut we already thought of ""EXULT"" with X and L.\n\nOption 2: Assume E in position4: then word is ? U ? E T\n\nWe can have ""QUIET"" with Q and I, or ""DUVET"" with D and V.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one is correct.\n\nWe could choose a word that doesn\'t commit to E in 1 or 4 but tests both possibilities? But we have to have E in one of them.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has E in position1 and tests position4 with a new letter, or vice versa.\n\nBut note: we have to make a valid word.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that has E in position1 and also tests a common letter in position4, and a common letter in position3.\n\nFor example, ""EUROT""? Not a word.\n\n""EIGHT"" but position2 is U, not I.\n\nWe must have U in position2.\n\nSo let\'s list possible words:\n\nFor E in pos1: \n- EXULT (X in pos3, L in pos4)\n\nFor E in pos4:\n- QUIET (Q in pos1, I in pos3)\n- DUVET (D in pos1, V in pos3)\n- Other: ""SUQET""? Not a word. ""CUVET""? C excluded. ""HUTET""? Not a word. ""LUTED""? But D in pos5, not T? ""LUTED"" is L-U-T-E-D, so T in pos3? But we need T in pos5. Not matching.\n\n""PURET""? Not a word. ""JUMET""? Not a word.\n\n""BUTEI""? Not a word.\n\nSo the common ones are: EXULT (E in 1), QUIET (E in 4), DUVET (E in 4).\n\nNow, we need to choose one as our guess. But we don\'t know which pattern is correct.\n\nWe can choose ""EXULT"" to test the E-in-pos1 case. If it\'s correct, we win. If not, we know E must be in pos4.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose ""QUIET"" or ""DUVET"", we test E-in-pos4.\n\nBut we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s see the letters tested:\n\n- EXULT: tests X and L (and confirms E, U, T positions, but we already know U and T are fixed, and E is present but we are testing its position).\n- QUIET: tests Q and I.\n- DUVET: tests D and V.\n\nWhich letters are more common? I and L are very common, D is common, X and Q are less common.\n\nSo perhaps testing I and L is better.\n\nBut we can also consider a word that tests both I and L? But we have to fit the pattern.\n\nIs there a word that has U in pos2, T in pos5, E in either 1 or 4, and uses I and L?\n\nFor example, if E in pos1: E U ? ? T, and we want I and L. But we have two positions: 3 and 4. So we could have E U I L T? ""EUILT"" not a word. E U L I T? ""ELUIT"" not a word.\n\nIf E in pos4: ? U ? E T, and we want I and L. So position1 and 3: I and L? For example, L U I E T? ""LUIET"" not a word. I U L E T? ""IULET"" not a word.\n\nSo no word with both I and L.\n\nWe might have to choose one.\n\nAnother candidate: what about ""OUNCE""? But C excluded and E in pos5? Not allowed.\n\n""OUTED""? But E in pos4? O-U-T-E-D -> but T is in pos3, not pos5. We need T in pos5. So ""OUTED"" has T in pos3 and D in pos5, not matching.\n\n""UNTIE""? U in pos1? We need U in pos2.\n\nSo let\'s decide on a guess.\n\nI think ""QUIET"" is a good choice because:\n- It tests two new common letters: Q and I. But Q is not very common, but I is a vowel and common.\n- If we get a ✓ for Q in position1, then we know the word starts with Q and E is in pos4.\n- If we get an x for Q, then E must be in pos1 (since if E is in pos4, then position1 must be a letter that is not Q, but we don\'t know what it is). Actually, if Q is absent, then ""QUIET"" is not the word, and E must be in pos1? Not necessarily: the word could still have E in pos4 and a different letter in pos1, like in ""DUVET"". So we don\'t directly conclude E must be in pos1 if Q is absent.\n\nSimilarly, for I: if I is present, it might be in pos3 or elsewhere? But we don\'t know.\n\nThis might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have E in it? But we know E is in the word, so we must include E to get feedback on its position. If we don\'t include E, we might get an x for E, but we know it\'s present, so that would be a wasted guess. So we must include E.\n\nWe have to include E.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that has E in position4 and tests common letters in the other positions.\n\nFor example, ""DUVET"" tests D and V, but V is less common.\n\nOr ""QUIET"" tests Q and I.\n\nBut we can try ""BUYET""? Not a word.\n\n""PURET""? Not a word.\n\n""JUMET""? Not a word.\n\n""KUTER""? Not a word.\n\n""LUTEA""? Not a word and A excluded.\n\n""MYTHS""? S excluded.\n\nSo limited options.\n\nPerhaps ""EXULT"" is better because it tests X and L, and if it\'s not correct, we know E is in pos4.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""EXULT"" and it\'s not the word, then we know E is in pos4, and we can then guess one of the pos4 options next.\n\nAlso, ""EXULT"" uses more common letters than ""QUIET"" with Q? L is more common than Q.\n\nLetter frequency in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... L is 12th, Q is 24th.\n\nSo L is better to test.\n\nMoreover, X is less common, but it might help eliminate.\n\nSo I think ""EXULT"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut let\'s see what happens if we guess ""EXULT"":\n\n- If the word is ""EXULT"", we win.\n\n- If not, then we know:\n  - E is not in position1, so it must be in position4.\n  - Also, we get feedback on X and L: if they are present or not.\n\nBut if E is in position4, then the word is _ U _ E T.\n\nAnd we know from ""EXULT"" feedback:\n  - If X is absent, then the first letter is not X and not any excluded.\n  - If L is absent, then the word doesn\'t have L.\n\nThen we can guess ""DUVET"" or ""QUIET"" next.\n\nBut we might be able to guess in a way that tests more letters.\n\nAnother candidate: what about ""HUTED""? Not a word.\n\n""FUTILE""? 6 letters.\n\n""BUTEO""? B-U-T-E-O -> but T is in position3, not 5. We need T in position5.\n\nSo not.\n\nPerhaps we can try ""OUNCE"" but C excluded.\n\nI think ""EXULT"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s consider ""DUVET"". It tests D and V, which are also useful.\n\nBut V is less common than L.\n\nSimilarly, ""QUIET"" has Q which is rare.\n\nSo ""EXULT"" with L is better.\n\nBut there\'s another word: ""ELUTE"". E-L-U-T-E. But that has E in position1 and 5? But position5 is T, not E. And we know E is not in position5. So ""ELUTE"" has E at the end, which is invalid for our use because position5 must be T.\n\nSo not.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""EXULT"".\n\nBut let\'s double-check the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""QUIET"":\n\nIf secret word is ""QUIET"", and we guess ""EXULT"":\n- E: in ""EXULT"" is position1, but in ""QUIET"" E is position4 -> so E should be marked as present but wrong position (-).\n- X: not in ""QUIET"" -> absent (x).\n- U: in position2 in both -> correct (✓).\n- L: not in ""QUIET"" -> absent (x).\n- T: in position5 in both -> correct (✓).\n\nSo feedback: E(-), X(x), U(✓), L(x), T(✓)\n\nThen we know E is not in pos1 (because we got - for E in pos1), so it must be in pos4. Also, X and L are absent.\n\nThen we can guess a word with E in pos4, U in2, T in5, and avoid X and L, and the other excluded letters.\n\nPossible words: ""QUIET"" or ""DUVET"" or others? But with X and L absent, and we know the word has E in pos4.\n\nSo we would guess ""QUIET"" next, and if it\'s not, then ""DUVET"".\n\nSimilarly, if the secret word is ""DUVET"", and we guess ""EXULT"":\n- E: in pos1 in guess, but in ""DUVET"" E is pos4 -> (-)\n- X: not in ""DUVET"" -> (x)\n- U: (✓)\n- L: not in ""DUVET"" -> (x)\n- T: (✓)\n\nSame feedback as above.\n\nThen we would guess ""QUIET"" or ""DUVET"". If we guess ""QUIET"" and it\'s not, then we know it\'s ""DUVET"".\n\nBut we have 4 guesses left, so it\'s manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we could guess a word that tests multiple options at once, but it\'s hard.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word that has E in position4 and tests two new common letters for positions1 and3.\n\nFor example, ""DUVET"" or ""QUIET"", but we don\'t know which.\n\nOr is there a word like ""HUTED""? Not valid.\n\n""PUKED""? But E in pos4? P-U-K-E-D -> D in pos5, not T. Not matching.\n\nSo I think ""EXULT"" is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""EXULT"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  \n  - **Deductions**:  \n    - C, R, A, N are **absent** from the secret word.  \n    - E is **present** but not in position 5.  \n- **Guess 2: ""guest""** → G(x), U(✓), E(-), S(x), T(✓)  \n  - **Deductions**:  \n    - G and S are **absent**.  \n    - U is **correct and in position 2**.  \n    - E is **present but not in position 3** (since it received ""-"").  \n    - T is **correct and in position 5**.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Confirmed letters and positions**:  \n   - Position 2: **U** (fixed).  \n   - Position 5: **T** (fixed).  \n   - E is **present** but **cannot be in positions 3 or 5** (from both guesses).

We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.
- E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""guest"" -> G(x), U(✓), E(-), S(x), T(✓)
Meaning:
- G and S are absent.
- U is correct and in position 2 (since in ""guest"", U is the second letter and gets ✓).
- E is present but not in position 3 (because we got '-' for E in position 3).
- T is correct and in position 5 (since in ""guest"", T is the fifth letter and gets ✓).

Guess 3: ""exult"" -> E(-), X(x), U(-), L(x), T(✓)
Meaning:
- E is present but not in position 1 (because we got '-' for E in position 1).
- X is absent (so not in the word).
- U is present but not in position 2? Wait, we had U as correct in position 2 in the previous guess? This is confusing.

Let's clarify: In ""exult"", the positions are:
- Position 1: E
- Position 2: X? No, ""exult"" is E-X-U-L-T? 
Actually, ""exult"" is spelled E-X-U-L-T, so:
- Position 1: E
- Position 2: X
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: T

But in the secret word, we know from guess 2 that:
- U is correct in position 2? But in ""exult"", U is in position 3.

So when we guessed ""exult"", which has U in position 3, the feedback for U is (-). Why?

Reason: The feedback symbol '-'' means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. So for U, it is present but not in position 3? But we know from guess 2 that U is in position 2 of the secret word. 

Therefore, in guess 3 (""exult""), U is placed in position 3, but in the secret word, U is fixed in position 2. So the U in position 3 of our guess is wrong; hence, it shows U(-), meaning U is in the word but not in position 3 (which we already knew because it is in position 2).

Similarly, T is in position 5 in both, so we get T(✓).

Now, feedback for ""exult"":
- E: position 1 -> marked '-' , so E is present but not in position 1.
- X: position 2 -> marked 'x', so X is absent.
- U: position 3 -> marked '-' , so U is present but not in position 3 (we know it's in position 2).
- L: position 4 -> marked 'x', so L is absent.
- T: position 5 -> marked '✓', so correct and in position 5.

So what do we learn?

From the feedback:

1. E is present but not in position 1 (we already knew not in positions 3 and 5; now also not in position 1). Therefore, the only remaining position for E is position 4 (since position 2 is U).

Thus, E must be in position 4.

2. X and L are absent. So we add X and L to the absent list.

3. T is confirmed in position 5 (already knew).

4. U is confirmed in position 2 (already knew).

Also, from previous, we have absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, S, and now X, L.

So absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, S, X, L.

Now, we know:
- Position 2: U
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: T

And we need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters not excluded and that form a valid word.

Secret word pattern: [1] U [3] E T

We know:
- The letter in position 1 and position 3 must not be any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, S, X, L.
- Also, we haven't tested many letters, so they could be B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

Moreover, we know E is in position 4, so no E in other positions? But we have only one E so far? We don't know if there are duplicates, but we can assume no duplicates for now to simplify.

The word must have exactly these letters: [1], U, [3], E, T.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? U ? E T.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

We should choose a guess that uses common letters to fill positions 1 and 3.

Possible words:

- QUIET: Q U I E T -> but we know from guess 2 that I was in ""guest"" at position4? No, in ""guest"" we had E at position3? Actually, ""guest"" was G U E S T, so we tested S (absent) and we didn't test I. So QUIET might be possible? And it avoids the absent letters? Q, U, I, E, T -> Q and I not excluded.

But in QUIET, position 3 is I, position 1 is Q.

- DUVET: D U V E T -> position 3 is V. Also avoids absent letters? D and V not excluded.

- Other words: 
  - SUITE: but S excluded -> invalid.
  - JUICE: J excluded? We haven't tested J, but J is not excluded? Actually, J is not in the absent list. But JUICE: J U I C E -> C is excluded? C is in absent list -> invalid.
  - BUYET? Not a word.
  - BUTTE? B U T T E? ""BUTTE"" is a word, meaning a hill. But it has two T's? And position 3 is T? But T is already at position 5. Also, the pattern is ? U ? E T, so in BUTTE: B(1), U(2), T(3), T(4)? E is at position 5? But we need E at position 4 and T at 5. BUTTE has E at position 5? B-U-T-T-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:T, 4:T, 5:E. But we need position 4 to be E and position 5 to be T. So does not match.

  We need position 4: E, position 5: T.

  So words ending in ""ET"" but with U at position2 and the first and third letters changing.

Possible words:
- QUIET: Q U I E T -> letters: Q, I. Both not excluded.
- DUVET: D U V E T -> letters: D, V.
- HUTET? Not a word.
- FUTET? Not a word.
- MUTED: M U T E D? But T is at position3? And D at position5? We need position5: T -> doesn't match. ""MUTED"": M(1), U(2), T(3), E(4), D(5). But we need T at position5. So no.
- But note: position5 is T, so the word must end with ""E T""? No, positions 4 and 5: E and T, so it must be ... E T? For example, ""SHEET"" but not matching pattern.

Actually, the word pattern is: ? U ? E T -> so last two letters are E T? No: position4 is E, position5 is T, so it ends in ""ET"", but the third letter is variable.

For example, words like ""quiet"", ""duvet"".

Others: ""SUQET""? Not valid.
""BIKET""? Not a word.

""QUIET"" and ""DUVET"" are the main common ones.

We can try to test multiple possibilities by choosing a guess that includes common letters for positions 1 and 3.

But we only have positions 1 and 3 unknown.

We can guess a word that has known correct letters? Or we can use a word that tests letters even if they are not in these positions? But we need the guess to be a valid word, and we know positions 2,4,5 are fixed? In our guess, we have to put U, E, T in positions 2,4,5? But wait: in the secret word, positions 2 and 5 are fixed as U and T, and position4 is E. But in our guess, we should also place U, E, T in the same positions to get feedback? Actually, we can, and it will confirm them.

Let's design the next guess:

We want to fill positions 1 and 3 with two new letters to test.

We can guess ""DUVET"": D U V E T

This will tell us:
- If D is in position1? We get feedback on D in position1.
- If V is in position3? Feedback on V in position3.
- Also, U should be ✓ (position2), E should be ? In ""duvet"", E is at position4? But we know in secret word, E is at position4? So E should be ? Since we place E at position4, and we know it should be correct? Because we deduced E must be at position4.

Actually, since we know E is at position4 from the deduction, we can expect ✓ for E in position4.

Similarly, U and T should be ✓.

Therefore, by guessing a word that has U in position2, E in position4, T in position5, and letters D and V in positions 1 and 3, respectively.

If we get ✓ for D and V, then it's correct. If not, then we know which letters are wrong.

Alternatively, we can guess ""QUIET"": Q U I E T, which would get ✓ for U, E, T? And feedback for Q in position1 and I in position3.

We should choose the one that tests more common letters? But both are possible, and we don't know.

We can also choose a word that tests one of these and uses a different letter? But there are few options.

Another possibility: ""OUNCE"" - no, C excluded.

""PIECE"" - P I E C E? But C excluded. Also E at position3? Positions: P(1), I(2), E(3), C(4), E(5). But we need U at position2 and E at position4? Not matching.

""QUEEN"" - Q U E E N? But E at position3? And we need E at position4. Positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), E(4), N(5). But N is absent? From guess1, N is absent -> invalid. Also, E at position3: we know E is not in position3? Because from guess2, E was in position3 of ""guest"" and got '-', meaning not in position3. So position3 cannot be E. Therefore, no E at position3.

Similarly, we cannot have duplicate E? But it might be possible? However, in this case, for ""QUEEN"", it has E in position3 and4? Position3 is wrong since E not in pos3, and position4 might be correct? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

But avoid complications.

We know E not in pos3, and must be in pos4? And we deduced it is in pos4.

So for position3, it cannot be E.

Therefore, the word is ? U ? E T

With ? being two distinct letters not excluded.

We can try to use high-frequency letters for position1 and3.

For example, vowels or common consonants: I, O, B, D, M, P, etc.

But specific to words: ""QUIET"" has I (vowel) and Q (rare).
""DUVET"" has V (rare) and D (common).

""MUZET""? Not a word.
""JUKED""? Not a word and we need E at position4.

""BYRES""? Ends with S? S excluded.

Not many common words.

Another word: ""JUICE""? But C excluded.

""PURET""? Not a word.

""DUETT""? Not a word.

""QUIET"" and ""DUVET"" seem to be the main candidates.

We could also consider ""NEWER""? But E at position1? And we know E not in pos1. Also not matching pattern: N E W E R -> positions not matching.

Or ""OFFED""? Not.

Given the options, we might choose ""QUIET"" to test Q and I, or ""DUVET"" to test D and V.

Q is less common, so if we get absent for Q, we eliminate, but D is more common? Letter frequency: D is about 8th, Q is 24th.

Similarly, I is a vowel, common; V is less common.

So ""QUIET"" tests Q (rare) and I (common).

""DUVET"" tests D (common) and V (rare).

We could choose a word that tests two common letters, but what word has ? U ? E T with common letters?

For example, ""BUTTE"" - not, because it has T at position3 and E at position5? Wrong.

""HUTED"" - not a word.

""LUTED"" - L U T E D -> T at position3? L(1), U(2), T(3), E(4), D(5). So D at position5? But we need T at position5. So no.

Unless the secret word is ""LUTED"", but then position5 must be T? ""LUTED"" ends with D, not T. So invalid pattern.

""PUTEZ""? Unknown word.

""CUTEY""? C excluded.

Therefore, I think we have to choose between ""QUIET"" and ""DUVET"".

We can also test both possibilities? But with one guess.

But note: we can guess a word that has the fixed U, E, T and tests new letters in position1 and3, but also includes the E even though it's fixed.

Now, we have 3 tries left? After this guess.

We might guess ""QUIET"". If it's not correct, then we know it must be ""DUVET"" or another rare word? Or we get feedback.

Similarly, if we guess ""QUIET"" and get Q absent and I absent? Then it might be ""DUVET"".

But let's list all possible words fitting the pattern and absent letters:

All 5-letter words of the form ? U ? E T

With letters not excluded: C,R,A,N,G,S,X,L excluded. So banned: C,R,A,N,G,S,X,L.

Available: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

Words I can think of:
- QUIET: Q U I E T
- DUVET: D U V E T
- JUMET? Not a word.
- FUMET? F U M E T? ""Fumet"" is a word, meaning a type of seasoning. So yes: F U M E T -> positions: F(1), U(2), M(3), E(4), T(5). So F and M.
- HUTET? Not.
- KUTEA? Not.
- but note: position5 is T, so must end with E T? Not necessarily, but in this pattern it does.

Another: ""PUTED""? Not found.
""BUTEI"" not.

""MOVET"" not.

So words: QUIET, DUVET, FUMET.

FUMET: F and M.

So three possibilities: QUIET (Q,I), DUVET (D,V), FUMET (F,M).

We want to guess one that helps distinguish or uses common letters.

Perhaps we should choose ""QUIET"" because I is common and if Q is present, it's good, else we eliminate Q.

But Q is rare, so it might be absent.

Similarly, ""FUMET"" uses F and M, which are medium frequency.

The most common consonant among these is D? In ""DUVET"".

D is common, so testing D might be good.

Also, we haven't tested D yet.

In previous guesses, we tested:
- crane: C,R,A,N,E -> E present
- guest: G,U,E,S,T -> U,T present, E present, G,S absent
- exult: E,X,U,L,T -> E,U,T present (but U,T already known), X,L absent

So no D tested yet.

Similarly, we haven't tested B, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

So D is common.

Therefore, I think ""DUVET"" is a reasonable guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily in this pattern, but since we know the pattern, why not use it? If we guess a word that doesn't have E in position4, we'll get E marked as absent? But we know E must be in position4? Because it cannot be elsewhere? Unless we are wrong? But based on all feedback, E must be in position4.

So we must have E in position4, U in2, T in5.

Therefore, our guess should have U in position2, E in position4, T in position5? To verify? Actually, we can put them to confirm.

For example, if we guess ""abcde"" with U not in pos2, then U might get marked wrong position etc. But since we know, it's better to use the known positions.

So for guess4, we should guess a word that has U in position2, E in position4, T in position5, and two new letters in positions 1 and 3 to test.

Then the feedback will tell us if the letters are correct.

Therefore, we should choose among ""DUVET"", ""QUIET"", ""FUMET"".

Let's choose ""DUVET"" because D is a common letter and we haven't tested it yet.Also, V is less common, but if present, good.

<guess>duvet</guess>

But let's see how much time we have: we have multiple guesses? But we can do this.

So I'll go with ""duvet"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  - **Deductions**:  
    - C, R, A, N are **absent**.  
    - E is **present** but not in position 5.  
- **Guess 2: ""guest""** → G(x), U(✓), E(-), S(x), T(✓)  
  - **Deductions**:  
    - G, S are **absent**.  
    - U is **correct in position 2**.  
    - E is **present** but **not in position 3**.  
    - T is **correct in position 5**.  
- **Guess 3: ""exult""** → E(-), X(x), U(-), L(x), T(✓)  
  - **Deductions**:  
    - E is **present** but **not in position 1** (new information).  
    - X, L are **absent**.  
    - U(-) indicates U is in the word but not in position 3 (redundant, as we know U is fixed in position 2).  
    - T(✓) confirms position 5.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed letters and positions**:  
   - Position 2: **U** (must be U).  
   - Position 5: **T** (must be T).  
   - Position 4: **E** (must be E, deduced from eliminating other positions).  
     - E cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (from feedback), leaving only position 4.  
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, S, X, L (excluded).  
3. **Unknown positions**:  
   - **Position 1**: Unknown letter (not E, not absent).  
   - **Position 3**: Unknown letter (not E, not absent).  
4. **Remaining possibilities**: Words fitting the pattern `? U ? E T`. Valid candidates must avoid absent letters and include only untested characters (e.g., B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z).  
   - **Top candidates**:  
     - `QUIET` (tests Q and I).  
     - `DUVET` (tests D and V).  
     - `FUMET` (rare, tests F and M).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test high-frequency letters**: Prioritize common consonants like D or vowels like I.  
- **Efficiency**: ""DUVET"" is optimal because:  
  - Tests **D** (4th most common consonant) and **V** (moderately common).  
  - Uses the confirmed pattern (`D U V E T`), which will reveal correctness of D and V directly.  
  - If incorrect, feedback will instantly eliminate D and V (if marked ""x""), pointing to alternatives like `QUIET`.  
- **Risk mitigation**: Only 3 known candidates exist (`QUIET`, `DUVET`, `FUMET`). Guessing `DUVET` covers D/V, leaving fewer options for subsequent guesses.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Feedback**:  
   - From **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
     - E is present but not in position 5 (E(-)), and C/R/A/N are absent (all ""x"").  
   - From **Guess 2 (""guest"")**:  
     - U is correct in position 2 (U(✓)), T is correct in position 5 (T(✓)), and G/S are absent (G(x), S(x)). E is present but not in position 3 (E(-)).  
   - From **Guess 3 (""exult"")**:  
     - E is present but not in position 1 (E(-)), supporting prior deduction that E must be in position 4 (since only positions 1–4 were possible initially, and positions 1/3/5 are now invalid).  
     - X and L are absent (X(x), L(x)). U(-) reaffirms U is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent with U(✓) in position 2 from Guess 2). T(✓) reconfirms position 5.  

2. **Deductions**:  
   - **E must be in position 4**: Eliminated positions 1, 3, and 5 through feedback.  
   - **Fixed positions**:  
     - Position 2: **U**  
     - Position 4: **E**  
     - Position 5: **T**  
   - **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, S, X, L (cannot appear in the word).  
   - **Unknowns**: Positions 1 and 3 must be filled with untested letters not in the absent list (e.g., B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z).  

3. **Possible Words**:  
   - Words must fit the pattern `? U ? E T`.  
     - Top candidates based on common English words:  
       - `QUIET` (Q U I E T)  
       - `DUVET` (D U V E T)  
       - `FUMET` (F U M E T, less common but valid).  

4. **Strategy for Guess 4**:  
   - **Test high-frequency letters**: ""DUVET"" tests **D** (common consonant) and **V** (moderately common).  
   - **Efficiency**:  
     - If ""DUVET"" is correct, the game ends.  
     - If incorrect, feedback on D and V will confirm/eliminate them, narrowing to other candidates like `QUIET` (tests Q/I) or `FUMET` (tests F/M) with remaining guesses.  
   - **Avoid rare letters if possible**: `DUVET` uses ""D"" (high frequency) and ""V"" (targeted test), whereas `QUIET` relies on rare ""Q.""  

5. **Final Decision**: ""DUVET"" maximizes information gain by testing pragmatic letter combinations within the confirmed pattern.  

<guess>duvet</guess>",duvet,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.
- E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""guest"" -> G(x), U(✓), E(-), S(x), T(✓)
Meaning:
- G and S are absent.
- U is correct and in position 2 (since in ""guest"", U is the second letter and gets ✓).
- E is present but not in position 3 (because we got '-' for E in position 3).
- T is correct and in position 5 (since in ""guest"", T is the fifth letter and gets ✓).

Guess 3: ""exult"" -> E(-), X(x), U(-), L(x), T(✓)
Meaning:
- E is present but not in position 1 (because we got '-' for E in position 1).
- X is absent (so not in the word).
- U is present but not in position 2? Wait, we had U as correct in position 2 in the previous guess? This is confusing.

Let's clarify: In ""exult"", the positions are:
- Position 1: E
- Position 2: X? No, ""exult"" is E-X-U-L-T? 
Actually, ""exult"" is spelled E-X-U-L-T, so:
- Position 1: E
- Position 2: X
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: T

But in the secret word, we know from guess 2 that:
- U is correct in position 2? But in ""exult"", U is in position 3.

So when we guessed ""exult"", which has U in position 3, the feedback for U is (-). Why?

Reason: The feedback symbol '-'' means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. So for U, it is present but not in position 3? But we know from guess 2 that U is in position 2 of the secret word. 

Therefore, in guess 3 (""exult""), U is placed in position 3, but in the secret word, U is fixed in position 2. So the U in position 3 of our guess is wrong; hence, it shows U(-), meaning U is in the word but not in position 3 (which we already knew because it is in position 2).

Similarly, T is in position 5 in both, so we get T(✓).

Now, feedback for ""exult"":
- E: position 1 -> marked '-' , so E is present but not in position 1.
- X: position 2 -> marked 'x', so X is absent.
- U: position 3 -> marked '-' , so U is present but not in position 3 (we know it's in position 2).
- L: position 4 -> marked 'x', so L is absent.
- T: position 5 -> marked '✓', so correct and in position 5.

So what do we learn?

From the feedback:

1. E is present but not in position 1 (we already knew not in positions 3 and 5; now also not in position 1). Therefore, the only remaining position for E is position 4 (since position 2 is U).

Thus, E must be in position 4.

2. X and L are absent. So we add X and L to the absent list.

3. T is confirmed in position 5 (already knew).

4. U is confirmed in position 2 (already knew).

Also, from previous, we have absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, S, and now X, L.

So absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, S, X, L.

Now, we know:
- Position 2: U
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: T

And we need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters not excluded and that form a valid word.

Secret word pattern: [1] U [3] E T

We know:
- The letter in position 1 and position 3 must not be any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, S, X, L.
- Also, we haven't tested many letters, so they could be B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

Moreover, we know E is in position 4, so no E in other positions? But we have only one E so far? We don't know if there are duplicates, but we can assume no duplicates for now to simplify.

The word must have exactly these letters: [1], U, [3], E, T.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? U ? E T.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

We should choose a guess that uses common letters to fill positions 1 and 3.

Possible words:

- QUIET: Q U I E T -> but we know from guess 2 that I was in ""guest"" at position4? No, in ""guest"" we had E at position3? Actually, ""guest"" was G U E S T, so we tested S (absent) and we didn't test I. So QUIET might be possible? And it avoids the absent letters? Q, U, I, E, T -> Q and I not excluded.

But in QUIET, position 3 is I, position 1 is Q.

- DUVET: D U V E T -> position 3 is V. Also avoids absent letters? D and V not excluded.

- Other words: 
  - SUITE: but S excluded -> invalid.
  - JUICE: J excluded? We haven't tested J, but J is not excluded? Actually, J is not in the absent list. But JUICE: J U I C E -> C is excluded? C is in absent list -> invalid.
  - BUYET? Not a word.
  - BUTTE? B U T T E? ""BUTTE"" is a word, meaning a hill. But it has two T's? And position 3 is T? But T is already at position 5. Also, the pattern is ? U ? E T, so in BUTTE: B(1), U(2), T(3), T(4)? E is at position 5? But we need E at position 4 and T at 5. BUTTE has E at position 5? B-U-T-T-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:T, 4:T, 5:E. But we need position 4 to be E and position 5 to be T. So does not match.

  We need position 4: E, position 5: T.

  So words ending in ""ET"" but with U at position2 and the first and third letters changing.

Possible words:
- QUIET: Q U I E T -> letters: Q, I. Both not excluded.
- DUVET: D U V E T -> letters: D, V.
- HUTET? Not a word.
- FUTET? Not a word.
- MUTED: M U T E D? But T is at position3? And D at position5? We need position5: T -> doesn't match. ""MUTED"": M(1), U(2), T(3), E(4), D(5). But we need T at position5. So no.
- But note: position5 is T, so the word must end with ""E T""? No, positions 4 and 5: E and T, so it must be ... E T? For example, ""SHEET"" but not matching pattern.

Actually, the word pattern is: ? U ? E T -> so last two letters are E T? No: position4 is E, position5 is T, so it ends in ""ET"", but the third letter is variable.

For example, words like ""quiet"", ""duvet"".

Others: ""SUQET""? Not valid.
""BIKET""? Not a word.

""QUIET"" and ""DUVET"" are the main common ones.

We can try to test multiple possibilities by choosing a guess that includes common letters for positions 1 and 3.

But we only have positions 1 and 3 unknown.

We can guess a word that has known correct letters? Or we can use a word that tests letters even if they are not in these positions? But we need the guess to be a valid word, and we know positions 2,4,5 are fixed? In our guess, we have to put U, E, T in positions 2,4,5? But wait: in the secret word, positions 2 and 5 are fixed as U and T, and position4 is E. But in our guess, we should also place U, E, T in the same positions to get feedback? Actually, we can, and it will confirm them.

Let's design the next guess:

We want to fill positions 1 and 3 with two new letters to test.

We can guess ""DUVET"": D U V E T

This will tell us:
- If D is in position1? We get feedback on D in position1.
- If V is in position3? Feedback on V in position3.
- Also, U should be ✓ (position2), E should be ? In ""duvet"", E is at position4? But we know in secret word, E is at position4? So E should be ? Since we place E at position4, and we know it should be correct? Because we deduced E must be at position4.

Actually, since we know E is at position4 from the deduction, we can expect ✓ for E in position4.

Similarly, U and T should be ✓.

Therefore, by guessing a word that has U in position2, E in position4, T in position5, and letters D and V in positions 1 and 3, respectively.

If we get ✓ for D and V, then it's correct. If not, then we know which letters are wrong.

Alternatively, we can guess ""QUIET"": Q U I E T, which would get ✓ for U, E, T? And feedback for Q in position1 and I in position3.

We should choose the one that tests more common letters? But both are possible, and we don't know.

We can also choose a word that tests one of these and uses a different letter? But there are few options.

Another possibility: ""OUNCE"" - no, C excluded.

""PIECE"" - P I E C E? But C excluded. Also E at position3? Positions: P(1), I(2), E(3), C(4), E(5). But we need U at position2 and E at position4? Not matching.

""QUEEN"" - Q U E E N? But E at position3? And we need E at position4. Positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), E(4), N(5). But N is absent? From guess1, N is absent -> invalid. Also, E at position3: we know E is not in position3? Because from guess2, E was in position3 of ""guest"" and got '-', meaning not in position3. So position3 cannot be E. Therefore, no E at position3.

Similarly, we cannot have duplicate E? But it might be possible? However, in this case, for ""QUEEN"", it has E in position3 and4? Position3 is wrong since E not in pos3, and position4 might be correct? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

But avoid complications.

We know E not in pos3, and must be in pos4? And we deduced it is in pos4.

So for position3, it cannot be E.

Therefore, the word is ? U ? E T

With ? being two distinct letters not excluded.

We can try to use high-frequency letters for position1 and3.

For example, vowels or common consonants: I, O, B, D, M, P, etc.

But specific to words: ""QUIET"" has I (vowel) and Q (rare).
""DUVET"" has V (rare) and D (common).

""MUZET""? Not a word.
""JUKED""? Not a word and we need E at position4.

""BYRES""? Ends with S? S excluded.

Not many common words.

Another word: ""JUICE""? But C excluded.

""PURET""? Not a word.

""DUETT""? Not a word.

""QUIET"" and ""DUVET"" seem to be the main candidates.

We could also consider ""NEWER""? But E at position1? And we know E not in pos1. Also not matching pattern: N E W E R -> positions not matching.

Or ""OFFED""? Not.

Given the options, we might choose ""QUIET"" to test Q and I, or ""DUVET"" to test D and V.

Q is less common, so if we get absent for Q, we eliminate, but D is more common? Letter frequency: D is about 8th, Q is 24th.

Similarly, I is a vowel, common; V is less common.

So ""QUIET"" tests Q (rare) and I (common).

""DUVET"" tests D (common) and V (rare).

We could choose a word that tests two common letters, but what word has ? U ? E T with common letters?

For example, ""BUTTE"" - not, because it has T at position3 and E at position5? Wrong.

""HUTED"" - not a word.

""LUTED"" - L U T E D -> T at position3? L(1), U(2), T(3), E(4), D(5). So D at position5? But we need T at position5. So no.

Unless the secret word is ""LUTED"", but then position5 must be T? ""LUTED"" ends with D, not T. So invalid pattern.

""PUTEZ""? Unknown word.

""CUTEY""? C excluded.

Therefore, I think we have to choose between ""QUIET"" and ""DUVET"".

We can also test both possibilities? But with one guess.

But note: we can guess a word that has the fixed U, E, T and tests new letters in position1 and3, but also includes the E even though it's fixed.

Now, we have 3 tries left? After this guess.

We might guess ""QUIET"". If it's not correct, then we know it must be ""DUVET"" or another rare word? Or we get feedback.

Similarly, if we guess ""QUIET"" and get Q absent and I absent? Then it might be ""DUVET"".

But let's list all possible words fitting the pattern and absent letters:

All 5-letter words of the form ? U ? E T

With letters not excluded: C,R,A,N,G,S,X,L excluded. So banned: C,R,A,N,G,S,X,L.

Available: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

Words I can think of:
- QUIET: Q U I E T
- DUVET: D U V E T
- JUMET? Not a word.
- FUMET? F U M E T? ""Fumet"" is a word, meaning a type of seasoning. So yes: F U M E T -> positions: F(1), U(2), M(3), E(4), T(5). So F and M.
- HUTET? Not.
- KUTEA? Not.
- but note: position5 is T, so must end with E T? Not necessarily, but in this pattern it does.

Another: ""PUTED""? Not found.
""BUTEI"" not.

""MOVET"" not.

So words: QUIET, DUVET, FUMET.

FUMET: F and M.

So three possibilities: QUIET (Q,I), DUVET (D,V), FUMET (F,M).

We want to guess one that helps distinguish or uses common letters.

Perhaps we should choose ""QUIET"" because I is common and if Q is present, it's good, else we eliminate Q.

But Q is rare, so it might be absent.

Similarly, ""FUMET"" uses F and M, which are medium frequency.

The most common consonant among these is D? In ""DUVET"".

D is common, so testing D might be good.

Also, we haven't tested D yet.

In previous guesses, we tested:
- crane: C,R,A,N,E -> E present
- guest: G,U,E,S,T -> U,T present, E present, G,S absent
- exult: E,X,U,L,T -> E,U,T present (but U,T already known), X,L absent

So no D tested yet.

Similarly, we haven't tested B, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

So D is common.

Therefore, I think ""DUVET"" is a reasonable guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily in this pattern, but since we know the pattern, why not use it? If we guess a word that doesn't have E in position4, we'll get E marked as absent? But we know E must be in position4? Because it cannot be elsewhere? Unless we are wrong? But based on all feedback, E must be in position4.

So we must have E in position4, U in2, T in5.

Therefore, our guess should have U in position2, E in position4, T in position5? To verify? Actually, we can put them to confirm.

For example, if we guess ""abcde"" with U not in pos2, then U might get marked wrong position etc. But since we know, it's better to use the known positions.

So for guess4, we should guess a word that has U in position2, E in position4, T in position5, and two new letters in positions 1 and 3 to test.

Then the feedback will tell us if the letters are correct.

Therefore, we should choose among ""DUVET"", ""QUIET"", ""FUMET"".

Let's choose ""DUVET"" because D is a common letter and we haven't tested it yet.Also, V is less common, but if present, good.
