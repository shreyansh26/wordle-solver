We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback. So we need to make a first guess.
 Since it's the first guess, we want a word that covers common letters and also has a good distribution of letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", etc. because they contain common letters and have varied vowels and consonants.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it has common consonants (C, R, N) and a vowel (A, E). But note: we want 5 distinct letters to maximize the chance of getting multiple hits.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also a good one. However, I remember that ""RAISE"" is also common because it includes common vowels and consonants.

 Since the instructions didn't specify any restrictions, let me pick a word that has five distinct letters and covers common English letters.

 I choose: ""RAISE""

 Reason:
 - R, S, T, L, N, E, A, I are among the most common letters in English words.
 - ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E: two vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S). It covers three vowels and two common consonants.

 After this guess, we will get feedback that will guide our next steps.

 But note: the response format requires us to output only the guessed word in the specified format.

 Therefore, for our first guess we will use: RAISE

We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"": 
- R(✓) : R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 1).
- A(-) : A is in the secret word, but not in position 2.
- I(x) : I is not in the secret word.
- S(x) : S is not in the secret word.
- E(-) : E is in the secret word, but not in position 5.

So from Guess 1, we know:
- The secret word starts with R and has the letter A and E, but A is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.
- Also, I and S are not in the word.

Now, for the second guess:
- We must use a 5-letter word that begins with R (since R is correct in position 1).
- The word should include A and E, but A cannot be in position 2 and E cannot be in position 5.
- It must not contain I or S.

Let me think of words that start with R and contain A and E.

Possible positions for A: it can be in positions 3, 4, or 5? But note that the secret word has 5 letters, and position 2 is ruled out by feedback. Also, E cannot be at position 5, so E must be in position 2,3, or 4? But position 2 is now open for E? Let me see:

We have:
Position 1: R (fixed)
Position 2: Cannot be A, and we don't know yet. It could be E? But feedback for E says it's in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in position 2? Not necessarily, because E could be in 3 or 4 as well.

But note: A is not in position 2, but A exists somewhere else. Similarly, E exists but not in position 5.

We also need to avoid I and S.

Let me think of words: R _ _ _ _

We need to include A and E. Possible words:

- Let's list possibilities: The word must have A in positions 3,4, or 5? And E in positions 2,3, or 4? But note: positions cannot conflict.

Also, we should consider common letters.

Another common vowel is O? But we don't have information on O.

Let me try to find a word that has A and E, starting with R, without I or S.

Examples: 
- REACH: contains C, H. But E is in position 2? Then A would be in position 3? And H at the end. However, we don't know about C and H.

But wait: the feedback said A is in the word but not at position 2, so in REACH A is at position 3? That would be okay. Similarly, E is at position 2? We don't have feedback that E cannot be at position 2? The feedback only said E is not at position 5, so it could be at position 2.

But the word REACH has an E in position 2? And we have A in position 3? Then the feedback for this word would have been: R(✓), E(-) [if the secret word doesn't have E at position 2?], but we don't know yet.

Actually, we are not sure if E can be in position 2. The feedback from the first word doesn't restrict E from position 2? It only said E is in the word and not in position 5.

So E could be in position 2? Let me think: in the first guess, we had ""raise"" and position 2 was A. The secret word has A but not at position 2? So if E were at position 2 in the secret word, that would be fine? Then why was E marked as present but wrong position? Because E was placed at the fifth position in ""raise"", which was wrong.

So if we try a word with E at position 2, that might be correct? Or might not? We don't know.

We also need to avoid I and S.

Alternatively, we can try to use other vowels? But we know I is absent, so vowels are restricted. The word must have two vowels? Possibly.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses E in a different position? But let's maximize information.

Since A and E are present, we can also try to include other common letters that we haven't tested? For example, we now know R, A, E are in, and we can test other consonants.

We can also try to put A in position 3 or 4? And E in a position other than 5.

Let me brainstorm words starting with R, have A and E, no I, no S.

- REACH (R, E, A, C, H) -> E at 2, A at 3? If we guess this, we test letters C and H.
- REACT: similar.
- RENAL: E at 2, A at 4 -> avoiding position 5 for E? Position 2 for E: could it be?
  - Also, L might be present? 
- But REACT and REACH both have E at position 2? What if the secret word has E in position 3? Then in REACH, E would be marked as present but wrong position? Then we would know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word with E not in position 2? But to get more information.

Another idea: We have R fixed at 1. Then to test position for A, we can put A in a different position? Since it cannot be at position 2.

We also have E that must be placed not at position 5? So we can try E in positions 2, 3, or 4? But if we put E in a new position we might hit a correct one? Or if not, we learn.

But also, we need to avoid I and S.

Let me list some words:
Possible words: 
- RAYED: has Y and D? Too rare?
- RACED: E at position 5? But wait, E cannot be at position 5? Because feedback said E is in word but not at position 5. We cannot put E at position 5? Then RACED is invalid? Because last is E? We cannot use E at position 5 based on feedback? Yes, so RACED is invalid.

Similarly, words ending with E are invalid.

So E must be in positions 2, 3, or 4? And A must be in positions 3,4, or 5? But position 5 cannot be E? So position 5 must be A? Or another letter?

Position 5 could be A? Then E would be in 2,3,or4? And A also could be in 3 or 4 without conflict? Unless both A and E are required? Then we have two middle positions: 3 and 4 available? And position 2 and 5? Except position 2 cannot have A? And position 5 cannot have E? So A could be in 3,4,5? And E in 2,3,4? So they can share positions 3 and 4? One per position.

But we have multiple constraints? Let me list:

Must include: R (position 1), A, E.
Exclude: I, S.

Possible structure:

Option 1: 
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: any letter except A and except S,I? But also, E might be here? Or not? We don't know.
- Position 3: ?, could be A or E? Or other? But E might be in position 2? 
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: cannot be E? So it could be A? Or other?

Alternatively, let's consider words:

- ROUTE: has O,U,T? But we don't know if they are present? Also, E is at position 5? Not allowed? Yes, E cannot be at position 5? So ROUTE is invalid? Because last is E? We must avoid E in position 5? So any word ending with E is invalid.

Another word: REIGN: but it contains I? Not allowed? Because I is absent? We cannot have I? So REIGN is invalid.

- RANGE: has G? And E at position 5? Invalid? Cannot use E at position 5? How about RANDE? Not a word.

- REACH: R at 1, E at 2, A at 3? Then C and H? This could be? And E at 2? If E is not at position 2 in the secret word, then the feedback for E would be ""-"", meaning E is present but not at 2? 

Similarly, REACT: same as REACH? Or RENAL? Or RENAL: R, E (2), N (3), A (4), L (5)? Then A at position 4? And E at 2? And we avoid S and I.

RENAL is a valid word?

Alternatively: RECUT: U? And E at position 2? But E at 2? And last T? And A is not in RECUT? Oh no: RECUT doesn't contain A? We need A? So invalid.

We must include A? We know A is in the word? So we need a word that has A? So RECUT doesn't work.

Another idea: REAPS: but contains S? S is absent? So invalid.

So let's think: 
- We need a word that: starts with R, has A and E, no I, no S, and E not at position 5? Therefore, E must be in 2,3, or 4? And A must be in 3,4, or 5? But note, if A is at position 5, then E must be in 2,3, or4? 

But the word must be five letters? Let's list words meeting these:

- REACH: R, E, A, C, H (E and A not in forbidden positions? E at 2? A at 3? So position 2 is E? But feedback did not say E cannot be at position 2? So it could be? And we test C and H.
- REACT: similar? R, E, A, C, T? With E at 2, A at 3.
- READY: R, E, A, D, Y? E at 2, A at 3? And D and Y.
- REBAR: R, E, B, A, R? Has two R's? Our feedback: the first word had one R, which was at position 1? But we don't know if there is another R? Because feedback didn't say about duplicate letters? So possibility? But REBAR has R at position 1 and 5? And A at position 4? Then E would be at position 2? And B? Also, the secret word might have only one R? Or two? We don't know? Use caution? But REBAR is a valid word? Meaning? Yes? But perhaps we avoid duplicates? Not necessary.

But note: in the first guess ""raise"", the R at position 1 was marked as correct? Also, there was an E at position 5 that was marked as present but wrong? So if the secret word has another R? It would have been shown? Let me check: the feedback for ""raise"" was R(✓), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(-). Only one R was shown? So the secret word may have only one R? Or if there were two R's, we might have seen it? For example, if the secret word had R in position 1 and another R? Then when we guessed ""raise"" which has only one R (position 1)? Then the missing R would not be caught? Because if the secret word has two R's, and we only guessed one R? Then the feedback might not indicate there is a second R? Unless the second R is present? No: the feedback for S and I were absent? So if the secret word had an R in position 3? Then in guess ""raise"", we didn't guess an R at position 3? So it's not indicated? So it is possible? We don't know if there are duplicate letters? So words with duplicate letters are not forbidden? But our guess words must be real? But real words can have duplicates.

But to be safe? Maybe we should avoid duplicates in this guess? Because we are not sure? So I will avoid words with duplicate R? Only one R? Because we only know one R is present? But if we guess a word with two R's? We might get additional information? For example, if the secret word does not have two R's, then the second R would be marked as x? So we would know? Similarly, if the secret word does have a second R, we would get ✓ or -? So it gives information? But it uses up a letter spot? So let's consider: both strategies are valid? But perhaps for second guess? We want to test as many new letters as possible? So including two R's would only test three new letters? Whereas without duplicates, we test four new letters? So better?

So I prefer words with no duplicated letters? But not necessary? But let's see options:

REACH has: R, E, A, C, H -> five distinct letters? Yes? R, E, A, C, H? R is repeated? Oh, position 1 is R? Then E, A, C, H? All different? So no duplicates? So five distinct letters? REACH: distinct letters? R, E, A, C, H? Yes? But R is at position 1? And the other letters are distinct? So yes.

Similarly, REACT? R, E, A, C, T? Distinct? Yes? EACT? Yes? But E, A? Different? So distinct.

So let's choose between the two? REACT and REACH? Or other?

But we do not know about T, C, H? So both test different letters? REACT tests C and T? REACH tests C and H? How common are T, C, H? All common? Probably? Alternatively, we can consider words with E in another position.

For example, what if E is not in position 2? Then what words? For example:

- TRADE: starts with T? Not R? No: we must start with R? Because in position 1 R is fixed? So every guess must have R in position 1? At least until we get more feedback? So no: must be R in position 1.

Then, words with E not in position 2? What about at position3? Like RACET? Not a word? Or RANED? Not a word? RACER? But ends with R? E is at position 4? Position 1: R? Position 2: A? Cannot be A? So we must avoid A at position2? So cannot be RA? then?

How about RUCHE? Not a common word? Maybe not.

Another: REGAL? E at position 2? Then G, A, L? Same issue? Then A at position 4? And L at 5? So REGAL: R, E, G, A, L? Distinct letters? Yes? And E at 2? A at 4? So similar to REACH? 

But REGAL? I is not included? S is not? But E at position 2? Then feedback would tell us? Similarly, REGAL? Okay? 

Or RENAL? R, E (2), N (3), A (4), L (5)? Then E at2? But same? 

But RENAL and REGAL? Only difference: G or N? 

How about a word with E at position 3? Then we can avoid position2 for E? And test a different letter at position2? Since position2 is open? But then we need A too? But A cannot be at position2? So position2 has to be a letter that we don't know? 

So words: R_E_? Where E is in position3? So _ can be filled? For example: RULER? But E at position3? Then R, U, L, E, R? Duplicate R? Not necessarily bad? But we test U, L? And E at position 3? Then A: but RULER doesn't have A? Required? We must include A? So RULER is invalid.

Another: ROBED? E at position 4? Then D at 5? O, B? But no A? Required.

So hard? Words with E in middle and A elsewhere? 

One option: RAREE? Not a common word? And duplicate R? And E in the end?

Alternatively: RANZE? Not a word.

So easier to use E in position2? And A in a later position.

I think REACH, REACT, READY, REGAL, RENAL are all candidates.

But we need to choose one? Let me pick one that has common letters? To maximize information?

REACH: uses letters R, E, A, C, H? E is already known? So new letters: C and H? Similarly, REACT: new letters C and T? REGAL: new letters G, L? Etc.

Which letters are more common? T? C? G? T and C are common? 

Also, we want to avoid duplicating vowels? We already know the vowel E and A? And I is absent, so U and O and Y? Might be present? 

But we can test consonants? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that puts A in a different position? Because in the first guess, A was at position 2? And now we can put A at position 3 or 4?

For example, REACH has A at position 3? Which is different than 2? So good? Similarly, REGAL has A at position 4? Which is also different? But position might be fixed?

But REACT has A at position 3? Same as REACH? 

Now, let's pick between REACH and REACT? 

Well, T is more common in five-letter words than H? Maybe? But both are common? 

I recall that the most common consonants after R are T, N, L? Then? Actually, common letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S? But we know I and S are absent? So T, N? Then L? So maybe REACT? Because T is more common than H? 

REACT: 
- R (position 1: ✓)
- E: at position 2? Maybe? 
- A: at position 3? Maybe?
- C: unknown? 
- T: unknown?

We test T? We want to test T? 

Similarly, REACH: tests H? 

But H is less common? So REACT might be better? 

Another common option: READY? D and Y? D common? Y somewhat? 

But T is more common? So I think REACT is good? 

But also: the secret word might be REACT itself? Possible? 

Given that feedback: R correct? A and E present? Then REACT would fit? But note: in the first guess, A was not at position 2? So at position 3? Then E? At position 2? Then? Yes? But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we should not guess the exact word? But we could? 

But we have six tries? Better to test? 

So I choose REACT?

But wait: REACT? Letters R,E,A,C,T. But the secret word has E? And we put E at position 2? Also A at position 3? 

But the feedback might be: 
- If the secret word has E at position 2, then it would be ✓? Or if not, then -? Similarly for A? 

By choosing REACT, we cover the possibility that E is at position2? If it is, then we get ✓? Or if not, then we know E is in another position? 

Also, we test C and T? Which are important? 

Similarly, we avoid I and S? And E not at position5? So valid? 

So I think REACT is a good candidate?

But note: R, E, A, C, T? A is at position 3? Which was position 3 in the first guess? Wait, in the first word ""raise"", we had I at position 3? Which was absent? So we know nothing about position 3? So A could be there? 

Similarly, position 4 was S? Which was absent? So also unknown? Etc? 

So I think REACT is fine.

Otherwise, REGAL? But G? Less common.

So let me go with REACT? 

Then we guess REACT? 

But what if the secret word is REACH? Then REACT would be close? But we need more guesses? 

We can choose a word that doesn't put E at position 2? So we can learn? For example, if we choose a word with E at position 3? And put a new letter at position 2? And then A at position 4? 

Example: ROUTE? But ends with E? Invalid? 

Or RACEY? Not a word? 

Or RANDE? Not a word? 

RATEL: R, A, T, E, L? But position 2 is A? Which is forbidden? So cannot? Because A must not be at position2? So we cannot put A at position2? 

Alternatively: 
- R?TE? How about R?TE? Not a word? 

Specifically: words with E not at 2? And A not at 2? Position 2 must be a letter we haven't used? 

Possible: RECTA? R, E, C, T, A? Then positions: R at1? Then E at position 2? Same? 
RECTA: positions are R, E, C, T, A? E at 2? And A at 5? But the word RECTA means anatomical? But valid? Then A at position 5? We need to check: the feedback did not say A cannot be at position 5? Only E cannot? So A can be at 5? 

But RECTA: E at 2? And A at 5? But we know E cannot be at 5? But no problem? Then position 2 is E? But same as REACT? 

Alternatively: How about ROBED? But no A? 

So it's hard to find a word without E at 2? 

Another: RARED? Not a common word? And duplicate E? R? R,A,R, E,D? Not valid? 

Therefore, I think words with E at position 2 are the most common? 

So I will go with REACT? 

Choose REACT? 

Similarly, READY? But D and Y? Less common? 

Or REAMY? Not a word? 

So I conclude: use REACT? 

So the guess is REACT? 

But let's write appropriately: <guess>react</guess>? 

But in uppercase? Probably case insensitive? But in response, lower case? So <guess>react</guess>

But wait: R,E,A,C,T? All letters? Yes.

Alternatively, if I choose RENAL? R, E, N, A, L? Then E at 2? A at 4? Then also tests N and L? 

N and L are common? Also? 

Similarly, REACT tests T? What about N? 

But both are good? So perhaps either? 

I'll stick with REACT? 

So let me output:
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- R is correct and in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- I and S are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- The word must start with R.
- It must contain A and E, but A cannot be in position 2 and E cannot be in position 5.
- It should exclude I and S.
- To maximize information, aim for a common word that introduces new, frequently used consonants and varies the positions of A and E.

After considering options like ""reach"", ""ready"", ""renal"", and ""react"":
- ""react"" (R, E, A, C, T) places E at position 2 and A at position 3, avoiding the forbidden positions. It introduces C (common) and T (very common) as new letters to test for presence.
- This choice efficiently explores potential positions for A and E while testing new consonants.

<guess>react</guess>
</think>
Based on the first guess feedback:
- **R** is correct and in position 1.
- **A** is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- **E** is in the secret word but not in position 5.
- **I** and **S** are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- The word must start with **R**.
- It must include **A** (in any position except 2) and **E** (in any position except 5).
- It must exclude **I** and **S**.
- To gather more information, prioritize words that test common letters (e.g., consonants like T, C, N) and position **E** differently than the first guess (where E was at position 5).

Options considered:
- **react**: Places R at position 1 (correct), E at position 2 (allowing us to check if E is here), A at position 3 (new position), and tests new letters C and T. Efficiently covers multiple unknowns.
- **renal**: Tests N and L but considers C and T more common overall.
- **ready**: Tests D and Y, but C and T are more frequently occurring letters.

Chose **react** to maximize:
- Testing potential positions for **E** (position 2) and **A** (position 3).
- Introducing **C** and **T**, two high-frequency consonants.
- Avoiding duplicates and invalid positions.

<guess>react</guess>",react,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""raise"": 
- R(✓) : R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 1).
- A(-) : A is in the secret word, but not in position 2.
- I(x) : I is not in the secret word.
- S(x) : S is not in the secret word.
- E(-) : E is in the secret word, but not in position 5.

So from Guess 1, we know:
- The secret word starts with R and has the letter A and E, but A is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.
- Also, I and S are not in the word.

Now, for the second guess:
- We must use a 5-letter word that begins with R (since R is correct in position 1).
- The word should include A and E, but A cannot be in position 2 and E cannot be in position 5.
- It must not contain I or S.

Let me think of words that start with R and contain A and E.

Possible positions for A: it can be in positions 3, 4, or 5? But note that the secret word has 5 letters, and position 2 is ruled out by feedback. Also, E cannot be at position 5, so E must be in position 2,3, or 4? But position 2 is now open for E? Let me see:

We have:
Position 1: R (fixed)
Position 2: Cannot be A, and we don't know yet. It could be E? But feedback for E says it's in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in position 2? Not necessarily, because E could be in 3 or 4 as well.

But note: A is not in position 2, but A exists somewhere else. Similarly, E exists but not in position 5.

We also need to avoid I and S.

Let me think of words: R _ _ _ _

We need to include A and E. Possible words:

- Let's list possibilities: The word must have A in positions 3,4, or 5? And E in positions 2,3, or 4? But note: positions cannot conflict.

Also, we should consider common letters.

Another common vowel is O? But we don't have information on O.

Let me try to find a word that has A and E, starting with R, without I or S.

Examples: 
- REACH: contains C, H. But E is in position 2? Then A would be in position 3? And H at the end. However, we don't know about C and H.

But wait: the feedback said A is in the word but not at position 2, so in REACH A is at position 3? That would be okay. Similarly, E is at position 2? We don't have feedback that E cannot be at position 2? The feedback only said E is not at position 5, so it could be at position 2.

But the word REACH has an E in position 2? And we have A in position 3? Then the feedback for this word would have been: R(✓), E(-) [if the secret word doesn't have E at position 2?], but we don't know yet.

Actually, we are not sure if E can be in position 2. The feedback from the first word doesn't restrict E from position 2? It only said E is in the word and not in position 5.

So E could be in position 2? Let me think: in the first guess, we had ""raise"" and position 2 was A. The secret word has A but not at position 2? So if E were at position 2 in the secret word, that would be fine? Then why was E marked as present but wrong position? Because E was placed at the fifth position in ""raise"", which was wrong.

So if we try a word with E at position 2, that might be correct? Or might not? We don't know.

We also need to avoid I and S.

Alternatively, we can try to use other vowels? But we know I is absent, so vowels are restricted. The word must have two vowels? Possibly.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses E in a different position? But let's maximize information.

Since A and E are present, we can also try to include other common letters that we haven't tested? For example, we now know R, A, E are in, and we can test other consonants.

We can also try to put A in position 3 or 4? And E in a position other than 5.

Let me brainstorm words starting with R, have A and E, no I, no S.

- REACH (R, E, A, C, H) -> E at 2, A at 3? If we guess this, we test letters C and H.
- REACT: similar.
- RENAL: E at 2, A at 4 -> avoiding position 5 for E? Position 2 for E: could it be?
  - Also, L might be present? 
- But REACT and REACH both have E at position 2? What if the secret word has E in position 3? Then in REACH, E would be marked as present but wrong position? Then we would know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word with E not in position 2? But to get more information.

Another idea: We have R fixed at 1. Then to test position for A, we can put A in a different position? Since it cannot be at position 2.

We also have E that must be placed not at position 5? So we can try E in positions 2, 3, or 4? But if we put E in a new position we might hit a correct one? Or if not, we learn.

But also, we need to avoid I and S.

Let me list some words:
Possible words: 
- RAYED: has Y and D? Too rare?
- RACED: E at position 5? But wait, E cannot be at position 5? Because feedback said E is in word but not at position 5. We cannot put E at position 5? Then RACED is invalid? Because last is E? We cannot use E at position 5 based on feedback? Yes, so RACED is invalid.

Similarly, words ending with E are invalid.

So E must be in positions 2, 3, or 4? And A must be in positions 3,4, or 5? But position 5 cannot be E? So position 5 must be A? Or another letter?

Position 5 could be A? Then E would be in 2,3,or4? And A also could be in 3 or 4 without conflict? Unless both A and E are required? Then we have two middle positions: 3 and 4 available? And position 2 and 5? Except position 2 cannot have A? And position 5 cannot have E? So A could be in 3,4,5? And E in 2,3,4? So they can share positions 3 and 4? One per position.

But we have multiple constraints? Let me list:

Must include: R (position 1), A, E.
Exclude: I, S.

Possible structure:

Option 1: 
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: any letter except A and except S,I? But also, E might be here? Or not? We don't know.
- Position 3: ?, could be A or E? Or other? But E might be in position 2? 
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: cannot be E? So it could be A? Or other?

Alternatively, let's consider words:

- ROUTE: has O,U,T? But we don't know if they are present? Also, E is at position 5? Not allowed? Yes, E cannot be at position 5? So ROUTE is invalid? Because last is E? We must avoid E in position 5? So any word ending with E is invalid.

Another word: REIGN: but it contains I? Not allowed? Because I is absent? We cannot have I? So REIGN is invalid.

- RANGE: has G? And E at position 5? Invalid? Cannot use E at position 5? How about RANDE? Not a word.

- REACH: R at 1, E at 2, A at 3? Then C and H? This could be? And E at 2? If E is not at position 2 in the secret word, then the feedback for E would be ""-"", meaning E is present but not at 2? 

Similarly, REACT: same as REACH? Or RENAL? Or RENAL: R, E (2), N (3), A (4), L (5)? Then A at position 4? And E at 2? And we avoid S and I.

RENAL is a valid word?

Alternatively: RECUT: U? And E at position 2? But E at 2? And last T? And A is not in RECUT? Oh no: RECUT doesn't contain A? We need A? So invalid.

We must include A? We know A is in the word? So we need a word that has A? So RECUT doesn't work.

Another idea: REAPS: but contains S? S is absent? So invalid.

So let's think: 
- We need a word that: starts with R, has A and E, no I, no S, and E not at position 5? Therefore, E must be in 2,3, or 4? And A must be in 3,4, or 5? But note, if A is at position 5, then E must be in 2,3, or4? 

But the word must be five letters? Let's list words meeting these:

- REACH: R, E, A, C, H (E and A not in forbidden positions? E at 2? A at 3? So position 2 is E? But feedback did not say E cannot be at position 2? So it could be? And we test C and H.
- REACT: similar? R, E, A, C, T? With E at 2, A at 3.
- READY: R, E, A, D, Y? E at 2, A at 3? And D and Y.
- REBAR: R, E, B, A, R? Has two R's? Our feedback: the first word had one R, which was at position 1? But we don't know if there is another R? Because feedback didn't say about duplicate letters? So possibility? But REBAR has R at position 1 and 5? And A at position 4? Then E would be at position 2? And B? Also, the secret word might have only one R? Or two? We don't know? Use caution? But REBAR is a valid word? Meaning? Yes? But perhaps we avoid duplicates? Not necessary.

But note: in the first guess ""raise"", the R at position 1 was marked as correct? Also, there was an E at position 5 that was marked as present but wrong? So if the secret word has another R? It would have been shown? Let me check: the feedback for ""raise"" was R(✓), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(-). Only one R was shown? So the secret word may have only one R? Or if there were two R's, we might have seen it? For example, if the secret word had R in position 1 and another R? Then when we guessed ""raise"" which has only one R (position 1)? Then the missing R would not be caught? Because if the secret word has two R's, and we only guessed one R? Then the feedback might not indicate there is a second R? Unless the second R is present? No: the feedback for S and I were absent? So if the secret word had an R in position 3? Then in guess ""raise"", we didn't guess an R at position 3? So it's not indicated? So it is possible? We don't know if there are duplicate letters? So words with duplicate letters are not forbidden? But our guess words must be real? But real words can have duplicates.

But to be safe? Maybe we should avoid duplicates in this guess? Because we are not sure? So I will avoid words with duplicate R? Only one R? Because we only know one R is present? But if we guess a word with two R's? We might get additional information? For example, if the secret word does not have two R's, then the second R would be marked as x? So we would know? Similarly, if the secret word does have a second R, we would get ✓ or -? So it gives information? But it uses up a letter spot? So let's consider: both strategies are valid? But perhaps for second guess? We want to test as many new letters as possible? So including two R's would only test three new letters? Whereas without duplicates, we test four new letters? So better?

So I prefer words with no duplicated letters? But not necessary? But let's see options:

REACH has: R, E, A, C, H -> five distinct letters? Yes? R, E, A, C, H? R is repeated? Oh, position 1 is R? Then E, A, C, H? All different? So no duplicates? So five distinct letters? REACH: distinct letters? R, E, A, C, H? Yes? But R is at position 1? And the other letters are distinct? So yes.

Similarly, REACT? R, E, A, C, T? Distinct? Yes? EACT? Yes? But E, A? Different? So distinct.

So let's choose between the two? REACT and REACH? Or other?

But we do not know about T, C, H? So both test different letters? REACT tests C and T? REACH tests C and H? How common are T, C, H? All common? Probably? Alternatively, we can consider words with E in another position.

For example, what if E is not in position 2? Then what words? For example:

- TRADE: starts with T? Not R? No: we must start with R? Because in position 1 R is fixed? So every guess must have R in position 1? At least until we get more feedback? So no: must be R in position 1.

Then, words with E not in position 2? What about at position3? Like RACET? Not a word? Or RANED? Not a word? RACER? But ends with R? E is at position 4? Position 1: R? Position 2: A? Cannot be A? So we must avoid A at position2? So cannot be RA? then?

How about RUCHE? Not a common word? Maybe not.

Another: REGAL? E at position 2? Then G, A, L? Same issue? Then A at position 4? And L at 5? So REGAL: R, E, G, A, L? Distinct letters? Yes? And E at 2? A at 4? So similar to REACH? 

But REGAL? I is not included? S is not? But E at position 2? Then feedback would tell us? Similarly, REGAL? Okay? 

Or RENAL? R, E (2), N (3), A (4), L (5)? Then E at2? But same? 

But RENAL and REGAL? Only difference: G or N? 

How about a word with E at position 3? Then we can avoid position2 for E? And test a different letter at position2? Since position2 is open? But then we need A too? But A cannot be at position2? So position2 has to be a letter that we don't know? 

So words: R_E_? Where E is in position3? So _ can be filled? For example: RULER? But E at position3? Then R, U, L, E, R? Duplicate R? Not necessarily bad? But we test U, L? And E at position 3? Then A: but RULER doesn't have A? Required? We must include A? So RULER is invalid.

Another: ROBED? E at position 4? Then D at 5? O, B? But no A? Required.

So hard? Words with E in middle and A elsewhere? 

One option: RAREE? Not a common word? And duplicate R? And E in the end?

Alternatively: RANZE? Not a word.

So easier to use E in position2? And A in a later position.

I think REACH, REACT, READY, REGAL, RENAL are all candidates.

But we need to choose one? Let me pick one that has common letters? To maximize information?

REACH: uses letters R, E, A, C, H? E is already known? So new letters: C and H? Similarly, REACT: new letters C and T? REGAL: new letters G, L? Etc.

Which letters are more common? T? C? G? T and C are common? 

Also, we want to avoid duplicating vowels? We already know the vowel E and A? And I is absent, so U and O and Y? Might be present? 

But we can test consonants? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that puts A in a different position? Because in the first guess, A was at position 2? And now we can put A at position 3 or 4?

For example, REACH has A at position 3? Which is different than 2? So good? Similarly, REGAL has A at position 4? Which is also different? But position might be fixed?

But REACT has A at position 3? Same as REACH? 

Now, let's pick between REACH and REACT? 

Well, T is more common in five-letter words than H? Maybe? But both are common? 

I recall that the most common consonants after R are T, N, L? Then? Actually, common letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S? But we know I and S are absent? So T, N? Then L? So maybe REACT? Because T is more common than H? 

REACT: 
- R (position 1: ✓)
- E: at position 2? Maybe? 
- A: at position 3? Maybe?
- C: unknown? 
- T: unknown?

We test T? We want to test T? 

Similarly, REACH: tests H? 

But H is less common? So REACT might be better? 

Another common option: READY? D and Y? D common? Y somewhat? 

But T is more common? So I think REACT is good? 

But also: the secret word might be REACT itself? Possible? 

Given that feedback: R correct? A and E present? Then REACT would fit? But note: in the first guess, A was not at position 2? So at position 3? Then E? At position 2? Then? Yes? But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we should not guess the exact word? But we could? 

But we have six tries? Better to test? 

So I choose REACT?

But wait: REACT? Letters R,E,A,C,T. But the secret word has E? And we put E at position 2? Also A at position 3? 

But the feedback might be: 
- If the secret word has E at position 2, then it would be ✓? Or if not, then -? Similarly for A? 

By choosing REACT, we cover the possibility that E is at position2? If it is, then we get ✓? Or if not, then we know E is in another position? 

Also, we test C and T? Which are important? 

Similarly, we avoid I and S? And E not at position5? So valid? 

So I think REACT is a good candidate?

But note: R, E, A, C, T? A is at position 3? Which was position 3 in the first guess? Wait, in the first word ""raise"", we had I at position 3? Which was absent? So we know nothing about position 3? So A could be there? 

Similarly, position 4 was S? Which was absent? So also unknown? Etc? 

So I think REACT is fine.

Otherwise, REGAL? But G? Less common.

So let me go with REACT? 

Then we guess REACT? 

But what if the secret word is REACH? Then REACT would be close? But we need more guesses? 

We can choose a word that doesn't put E at position 2? So we can learn? For example, if we choose a word with E at position 3? And put a new letter at position 2? And then A at position 4? 

Example: ROUTE? But ends with E? Invalid? 

Or RACEY? Not a word? 

Or RANDE? Not a word? 

RATEL: R, A, T, E, L? But position 2 is A? Which is forbidden? So cannot? Because A must not be at position2? So we cannot put A at position2? 

Alternatively: 
- R?TE? How about R?TE? Not a word? 

Specifically: words with E not at 2? And A not at 2? Position 2 must be a letter we haven't used? 

Possible: RECTA? R, E, C, T, A? Then positions: R at1? Then E at position 2? Same? 
RECTA: positions are R, E, C, T, A? E at 2? And A at 5? But the word RECTA means anatomical? But valid? Then A at position 5? We need to check: the feedback did not say A cannot be at position 5? Only E cannot? So A can be at 5? 

But RECTA: E at 2? And A at 5? But we know E cannot be at 5? But no problem? Then position 2 is E? But same as REACT? 

Alternatively: How about ROBED? But no A? 

So it's hard to find a word without E at 2? 

Another: RARED? Not a common word? And duplicate E? R? R,A,R, E,D? Not valid? 

Therefore, I think words with E at position 2 are the most common? 

So I will go with REACT? 

Choose REACT? 

Similarly, READY? But D and Y? Less common? 

Or REAMY? Not a word? 

So I conclude: use REACT? 

So the guess is REACT? 

But let's write appropriately: <guess>react</guess>? 

But in uppercase? Probably case insensitive? But in response, lower case? So <guess>react</guess>

But wait: R,E,A,C,T? All letters? Yes.

Alternatively, if I choose RENAL? R, E, N, A, L? Then E at 2? A at 4? Then also tests N and L? 

N and L are common? Also? 

Similarly, REACT tests T? What about N? 

But both are good? So perhaps either? 

I'll stick with REACT? 

So let me output:Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- R is correct and in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- I and S are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- The word must start with R.
- It must contain A and E, but A cannot be in position 2 and E cannot be in position 5.
- It should exclude I and S.
- To maximize information, aim for a common word that introduces new, frequently used consonants and varies the positions of A and E.

After considering options like ""reach"", ""ready"", ""renal"", and ""react"":
- ""react"" (R, E, A, C, T) places E at position 2 and A at position 3, avoiding the forbidden positions. It introduces C (common) and T (very common) as new letters to test for presence.
- This choice efficiently explores potential positions for A and E while testing new consonants.",Guess 2: react -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) A(✓) C(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
