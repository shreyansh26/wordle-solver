Alright, the user wants me to make the first guess in a Wordle-like game. Since it's the first attempt, I don't have any feedback to work with yet. I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain – ideally covering common letters and a mix of vowels/consonants. 

English vowels are A, E, I, O, U (sometimes Y). Among these, E and A are statistically the most common. For consonants, R, S, T, L, N are frequent. I recall ""ROATE"" is a popular starter among word game enthusiasts because it packs three vowels (O, A, E) and two common consonants (R, T). Hmm, but ""RAISE"" has the same advantages with S instead of T – and S is also very common. Which is better? Let me compare:

ROATE: R, O, A, T, E → Vowels: O, A, E (3), Consonants: R, T (2).  
RAISE: R, A, I, S, E → Vowels: A, I, E (3), Consonants: R, S (2).

Both cover 3 vowels and 2 high-frequency consonants. However, S appears more often than T in English words. Also, if the secret word has plural forms, S might be extra useful. Plus, I gets used more than O. So RAISE seems slightly superior for coverage.

Wait – is RAISE valid? Absolutely, it's a noun meaning to lift up. No exotic letters either, so it should be accepted. Confirming: R-A-I-S-E. Yep!

The goal here is to cast a wide net. RAISE tests R (most common consonant), three top vowels (A, I, E), and S (another top consonant). Whatever feedback comes back – whether greens, yellows, or grays – will immediately narrow down possibilities significantly. For instance:

- If S is correct/green, possibilities shrink dramatically.  
- If E is yellow, I know it's present but misplaced.  
- Even all grays would reveal those five are absent, which is valuable early on.

No point overthinking for a first guess. RAISE is methodically optimal. Let's go with that.

For my first guess, I need a word that maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback. I'll choose a word with common letters (vowels and frequent consonants) to cover broad possibilities. A good starting word often includes letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, A, and O. After considering options like ""ROATE"" or ""CRANE"", I select ""RAISE"" – it uses three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), all frequently appearing in English words. This should provide solid initial clues regardless of the secret word.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
I: x (not in the word)
S: - (in the word but wrong position)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and S, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"" (position 2 for A and position 4 for S).
- The letters R, I, and E are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain R, I, E.
- Contains A and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

We also know that A and S are in the word, so we can try to place them in other positions.

Possible positions for A: since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, S was in position 4 and that was wrong, so it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We also need to avoid R, I, E.

Let's think of words that have A and S, and avoid R, I, E.

Common letters we can use: we have A and S already. We can try to use other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are O, U (and sometimes Y). Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that has A and S, and three new letters that are not R, I, E.

We also want to test new positions for A and S.

For example, we can try putting A in position 1 and S in position 3? Or A in position 3 and S in position 1? We have to see what words exist.

Let me think of words that have A and S, and no R, I, E.

Some possibilities:
- A at the start: A _ _ S _ -> but we need to avoid E at the end? Words like ""aunts"" but that has U, N, T, S. But we have to avoid E? ""aunts"" doesn't have E, R, I? Let's check: A, U, N, T, S -> no R, I, E. But we have S at the end? In our feedback, S was in position 4 and was wrong, but now we are putting S at position 5? That's allowed because it's a different position.

But note: we have two letters we know: A and S. We also have three more letters to choose.

We can also consider words with A and S in other positions.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word (but not at position 2) and S is in the word (but not at position 4), we can try to put A in position 1 and S in position 5? Or A in position 3 and S in position 1? etc.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: A in position 1, S in position 5: words like ""atoms"" (but has O, M, T) -> but we don't know if O, M, T are allowed? They are not forbidden yet. However, ""atoms"" has O and M, which are new.

But we also have to avoid R, I, E. ""atoms"" doesn't have R, I, E? A, T, O, M, S -> no R, I, E. So it's okay.

Option 2: A in position 1, S in position 3: words like ""tasks"" (but that has two S's? and T, K) -> but we don't know if K is allowed. Also, ""tasks"" has two S's? T, A, S, K, S? Actually, ""tasks"" is T-A-S-K-S? That's 5 letters: T (1), A (2), S (3), K (4), S (5). But we have S at position 3 and 5? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. But in our case, we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or twice. However, in the feedback for ""raise"", we only had one S and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If the word had two S's, then we would have gotten two '-' for S? But we only had one S in ""raise"", so we only got one feedback for S. So it's possible that the word has two S's? But we don't know.

But in ""tasks"", we have A at position 2? But we are trying to put A in position 1? So that doesn't work.

We want A in position 1: so first letter A.

Words starting with A, containing S, and no R, I, E.

Examples:
- ALOES -> but has E? E is forbidden. So no.
- ATOLL -> no S? doesn't have S.
- ATOMS: A (1), T (2), O (3), M (4), S (5) -> no R, I, E. And S is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed). A is at position 1 (not 2, so allowed). This seems good.

Another: AULOS -> but U, L, O, S? A (1), U (2), L (3), O (4), S (5). No R, I, E. Also valid? Aulos is a musical instrument, but might be obscure.

Another: AUNTS: A (1), U (2), N (3), T (4), S (5). Common word.

We can also try S at the start? But we don't know if S can be at the start? It wasn't in position 4, but we can try position 1.

For example, S in position 1 and A in position 3: words like ""stain"" but has I? I is forbidden. ""stare"" has E? forbidden. ""scalp"" has C, A, L, P -> S (1), C (2), A (3), L (4), P (5). A is at position 3 (not 2, allowed) and S at position 1 (not 4, allowed). And no R, I, E. So ""scalp"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""shalt"" has H, A, L, T -> S (1), H (2), A (3), L (4), T (5). No R, I, E.

But we have to choose one.

We also want to cover new letters to get more information.

In the first guess, we used: R, A, I, S, E -> we know R, I, E are absent, and A and S are present.

So for the second guess, we want to test A and S in new positions, and also test new letters.

We have 5 positions. We can try to put A and S in positions that we haven't tried and that are allowed.

In the first guess, A was in position 2 (wrong) and S in position 4 (wrong). So we can try A in 1,3,5 and S in 1,2,3,5.

But we also want to avoid positions that are already known to be wrong for these letters? Actually, we don't know about other positions. We only know that position 2 is wrong for A and position 4 is wrong for S.

We can try to cover as many new positions as possible for A and S.

Also, we want to include common letters that we haven't tested: like T, N, O, L, etc.

Let me list some candidate words:

1. ATOMS: A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4), S(5) -> tests A at 1 (new), S at 5 (new). Also tests T, O, M which are new.

2. AUNTS: A(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> tests A at 1, S at 5. New letters: U, N, T.

3. SCALP: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), P(5) -> tests S at 1 (new), A at 3 (new). New letters: C, L, P.

4. SHALT: S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), T(5) -> similar to above, but with H and T.

5. PASTA: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5) -> but A is at position 2? We know that position 2 is wrong for A? So we cannot put A at position 2 again? Because we already know it's not there. So that would be a waste. Also, we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, putting A at position 2 again is not useful because we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 2 for A and position 4 for S.

Therefore, in PASTA, A is at position 2 and 5. Position 2 is forbidden for A, so we shouldn't do that. Also, S is at position 3? That's okay, but A at position 2 is invalid.

So we avoid words that put A at position 2 or S at position 4.

Now, among the candidates, which one gives the most information?

We want to test letters that are common and we haven't tried. We haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, M, P, H, etc.

ATOMS: tests T, O, M
AUNTS: tests U, N, T
SCALP: tests C, L, P
SHALT: tests H, L, T

T is a very common letter, so it might be good to include T.

Similarly, N and L are common.

We can also consider words that put A and S in positions that are more central to get more information about the middle.

But let's choose a word that uses common letters and avoids obscure ones.

Another candidate: ""TASKS"" -> but T(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5). But A is at position 2? We know A is not at position 2, so that's invalid.

""PASTY"" -> P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). Again, A at position 2: invalid.

""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This seems good: S at 1 (not 4), A at 3 (not 2). New letters: L, N, T. And no R, I, E.

Similarly, ""PLANS"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), S(5). But S is at position 5? That's okay. But we have A at 3 and S at 5.

""SLANT"" is a good candidate: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). It tests S at position 1, A at position 3, and new letters L, N, T.

We also avoid position 2 for A and position 4 for S? In this word, S is at 1 (not 4) and A is at 3 (not 2). Also, position 4 is N, which is new.

But note: in the feedback, we know that position 4 was S in the first guess and it was wrong, but that doesn't mean that position 4 cannot be another letter. We are free to put any letter at position 4.

So ""SLANT"" is valid.

Similarly, ""SALTS"": S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), S(5). But A is at position 2? That's not allowed because we know A is not at position 2. So invalid.

""OASIS"": O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5). But A at position 2? Invalid. Also, I is forbidden.

So back to ""SLANT"" and ""ATOMS"".

I think ""SLANT"" is a good choice because it tests S at the start and A in the middle, and common letters L, N, T.

Another option: ""SONAR"" but has R? R is forbidden.

""SAUCE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), C(4), E(5). But A at position 2? Invalid and E is forbidden.

So let's go with ""SLANT"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""SLANT"" is a valid English word.

We can also consider ""Casts"" but that has C, A, S, T, S -> but if we spell it as ""CASTS"", then C(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So I think ""SLANT"" is a solid choice.

Alternatively, ""PASTY"" is invalid because of A at 2.

Another word: ""MASON"" -> M(1), A(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). But A at position 2? Invalid.

""BASSO"" -> B(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So we avoid position 2 for A.

What about ""LASSO""? L(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5). Again, A at position 2? Invalid.

So we need a word without A at position 2 and without S at position 4.

""SLANT"" fits: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). S is at 1, A at 3, and position 4 is N (which is new).

We can also do ""SALON"": S(1), A(2), L(3), O(4), N(5). But A at position 2? Invalid.

""TALON"": T(1), A(2), L(3), O(4), N(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So ""SLANT"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""STANK"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), K(5). This is valid: S at 1, A at 3, and new letters T, N, K. But K is less common.

""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This is also valid: A at 3, and S is not in this word? But we know S must be in the word! So we cannot choose a word without S. We must include S.

Ah, important: we must include both A and S in the word because they are present.

So ""PLANT"" has A but not S? So that's invalid because we know S is in the word.

Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has A and S? A at 1, S at 5: yes.

""SLANT"" has S at 1 and A at 3: yes.

""STANK"" has S at 1 and A at 3: yes.

But ""STANK"" has K, which is less common. So ""SLANT"" or ""ATOMS"" might be better.

Between ""SLANT"" and ""ATOMS"", which one?

""SLANT"": letters S, L, A, N, T -> all common.
""ATOMS"": A, T, O, M, S -> also common.

We might want to avoid less common letters. Both are fine.

But note: in ""SLANT"", we are testing L, N, T. In ""ATOMS"", we are testing T, O, M.

We haven't tested any of these, so both are good.

I think ""SLANT"" is a good choice because it tests S at position 1 and A at position 3, which are positions we haven't tried for these letters.

We can also consider ""SALTY"", but S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So I'll go with ""SLANT"".

But let's confirm: the word must be 5 letters, English, and not use R, I, E.

""SLANT"": S, L, A, N, T -> no R, I, E. And A is at position 3 (not 2), S at position 1 (not 4). Good.

We could also do ""SNAPS"": S(1), N(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). This has A at 3 (good), S at 1 and 5? But we don't know if S appears twice. However, we are testing S at two positions: 1 and 5. But we already know S is in the word, so if we get a '-' for S at position 1 and/or 5, that tells us about the position. But if we get a 'x' for one of them, it might be confusing? Actually, if we get a 'x' for S at position 1, that means S is not at position 1, but we know S is in the word so it must be elsewhere. Similarly for position 5. But we are using two S's, which might be inefficient if the word has only one S.

But it's acceptable. However, ""SNAPS"" has P and S at position 4? Position 4: we know that in the first guess, position 4 was S and it was wrong, but that doesn't prevent us from putting another letter at position 4. In fact, we are putting P at position 4? The word is S(1), N(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). So position 4 is P, which is new.

But we are using two S's. Since we have limited guesses, it might be better to use five distinct letters to test more letters. But ""SLANT"" has distinct letters: S, L, A, N, T. Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has A, T, O, M, S -> distinct.

""SNAPS"" has two S's, so we are testing only four distinct letters: S, N, A, P.

So for information gain, distinct letters are better.

Therefore, ""SLANT"" or ""ATOMS"" are better.

I think I'll go with ""SLANT"".

So the next guess: SLANT.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, I, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A and S **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A cannot be in position 2, and S cannot be in position 4.

For the second guess:
- The word must include A and S, but avoid positions 2 for A and 4 for S.
- It must exclude R, I, and E entirely.
- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (like T, N, L) and place A and S in new positions not yet ruled out.

The word ""slant"" fits these criteria:
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so allowed).
- A is in position 3 (not 2, so allowed).
- It includes new common letters: L, N, T.
- It avoids R, I, E.
- All letters are distinct, which helps test more possibilities efficiently.

This guess will provide feedback on S at position 1, A at position 3, and the new letters L, N, T, helping narrow down the secret word.

<guess>slant</guess>",slant,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
I: x (not in the word)
S: - (in the word but wrong position)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and S, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"" (position 2 for A and position 4 for S).
- The letters R, I, and E are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain R, I, E.
- Contains A and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

We also know that A and S are in the word, so we can try to place them in other positions.

Possible positions for A: since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, S was in position 4 and that was wrong, so it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We also need to avoid R, I, E.

Let's think of words that have A and S, and avoid R, I, E.

Common letters we can use: we have A and S already. We can try to use other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are O, U (and sometimes Y). Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that has A and S, and three new letters that are not R, I, E.

We also want to test new positions for A and S.

For example, we can try putting A in position 1 and S in position 3? Or A in position 3 and S in position 1? We have to see what words exist.

Let me think of words that have A and S, and no R, I, E.

Some possibilities:
- A at the start: A _ _ S _ -> but we need to avoid E at the end? Words like ""aunts"" but that has U, N, T, S. But we have to avoid E? ""aunts"" doesn't have E, R, I? Let's check: A, U, N, T, S -> no R, I, E. But we have S at the end? In our feedback, S was in position 4 and was wrong, but now we are putting S at position 5? That's allowed because it's a different position.

But note: we have two letters we know: A and S. We also have three more letters to choose.

We can also consider words with A and S in other positions.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word (but not at position 2) and S is in the word (but not at position 4), we can try to put A in position 1 and S in position 5? Or A in position 3 and S in position 1? etc.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: A in position 1, S in position 5: words like ""atoms"" (but has O, M, T) -> but we don't know if O, M, T are allowed? They are not forbidden yet. However, ""atoms"" has O and M, which are new.

But we also have to avoid R, I, E. ""atoms"" doesn't have R, I, E? A, T, O, M, S -> no R, I, E. So it's okay.

Option 2: A in position 1, S in position 3: words like ""tasks"" (but that has two S's? and T, K) -> but we don't know if K is allowed. Also, ""tasks"" has two S's? T, A, S, K, S? Actually, ""tasks"" is T-A-S-K-S? That's 5 letters: T (1), A (2), S (3), K (4), S (5). But we have S at position 3 and 5? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. But in our case, we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or twice. However, in the feedback for ""raise"", we only had one S and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If the word had two S's, then we would have gotten two '-' for S? But we only had one S in ""raise"", so we only got one feedback for S. So it's possible that the word has two S's? But we don't know.

But in ""tasks"", we have A at position 2? But we are trying to put A in position 1? So that doesn't work.

We want A in position 1: so first letter A.

Words starting with A, containing S, and no R, I, E.

Examples:
- ALOES -> but has E? E is forbidden. So no.
- ATOLL -> no S? doesn't have S.
- ATOMS: A (1), T (2), O (3), M (4), S (5) -> no R, I, E. And S is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed). A is at position 1 (not 2, so allowed). This seems good.

Another: AULOS -> but U, L, O, S? A (1), U (2), L (3), O (4), S (5). No R, I, E. Also valid? Aulos is a musical instrument, but might be obscure.

Another: AUNTS: A (1), U (2), N (3), T (4), S (5). Common word.

We can also try S at the start? But we don't know if S can be at the start? It wasn't in position 4, but we can try position 1.

For example, S in position 1 and A in position 3: words like ""stain"" but has I? I is forbidden. ""stare"" has E? forbidden. ""scalp"" has C, A, L, P -> S (1), C (2), A (3), L (4), P (5). A is at position 3 (not 2, allowed) and S at position 1 (not 4, allowed). And no R, I, E. So ""scalp"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""shalt"" has H, A, L, T -> S (1), H (2), A (3), L (4), T (5). No R, I, E.

But we have to choose one.

We also want to cover new letters to get more information.

In the first guess, we used: R, A, I, S, E -> we know R, I, E are absent, and A and S are present.

So for the second guess, we want to test A and S in new positions, and also test new letters.

We have 5 positions. We can try to put A and S in positions that we haven't tried and that are allowed.

In the first guess, A was in position 2 (wrong) and S in position 4 (wrong). So we can try A in 1,3,5 and S in 1,2,3,5.

But we also want to avoid positions that are already known to be wrong for these letters? Actually, we don't know about other positions. We only know that position 2 is wrong for A and position 4 is wrong for S.

We can try to cover as many new positions as possible for A and S.

Also, we want to include common letters that we haven't tested: like T, N, O, L, etc.

Let me list some candidate words:

1. ATOMS: A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4), S(5) -> tests A at 1 (new), S at 5 (new). Also tests T, O, M which are new.

2. AUNTS: A(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> tests A at 1, S at 5. New letters: U, N, T.

3. SCALP: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), P(5) -> tests S at 1 (new), A at 3 (new). New letters: C, L, P.

4. SHALT: S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), T(5) -> similar to above, but with H and T.

5. PASTA: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5) -> but A is at position 2? We know that position 2 is wrong for A? So we cannot put A at position 2 again? Because we already know it's not there. So that would be a waste. Also, we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, putting A at position 2 again is not useful because we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 2 for A and position 4 for S.

Therefore, in PASTA, A is at position 2 and 5. Position 2 is forbidden for A, so we shouldn't do that. Also, S is at position 3? That's okay, but A at position 2 is invalid.

So we avoid words that put A at position 2 or S at position 4.

Now, among the candidates, which one gives the most information?

We want to test letters that are common and we haven't tried. We haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, M, P, H, etc.

ATOMS: tests T, O, M
AUNTS: tests U, N, T
SCALP: tests C, L, P
SHALT: tests H, L, T

T is a very common letter, so it might be good to include T.

Similarly, N and L are common.

We can also consider words that put A and S in positions that are more central to get more information about the middle.

But let's choose a word that uses common letters and avoids obscure ones.

Another candidate: ""TASKS"" -> but T(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5). But A is at position 2? We know A is not at position 2, so that's invalid.

""PASTY"" -> P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). Again, A at position 2: invalid.

""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This seems good: S at 1 (not 4), A at 3 (not 2). New letters: L, N, T. And no R, I, E.

Similarly, ""PLANS"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), S(5). But S is at position 5? That's okay. But we have A at 3 and S at 5.

""SLANT"" is a good candidate: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). It tests S at position 1, A at position 3, and new letters L, N, T.

We also avoid position 2 for A and position 4 for S? In this word, S is at 1 (not 4) and A is at 3 (not 2). Also, position 4 is N, which is new.

But note: in the feedback, we know that position 4 was S in the first guess and it was wrong, but that doesn't mean that position 4 cannot be another letter. We are free to put any letter at position 4.

So ""SLANT"" is valid.

Similarly, ""SALTS"": S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), S(5). But A is at position 2? That's not allowed because we know A is not at position 2. So invalid.

""OASIS"": O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5). But A at position 2? Invalid. Also, I is forbidden.

So back to ""SLANT"" and ""ATOMS"".

I think ""SLANT"" is a good choice because it tests S at the start and A in the middle, and common letters L, N, T.

Another option: ""SONAR"" but has R? R is forbidden.

""SAUCE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), C(4), E(5). But A at position 2? Invalid and E is forbidden.

So let's go with ""SLANT"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""SLANT"" is a valid English word.

We can also consider ""Casts"" but that has C, A, S, T, S -> but if we spell it as ""CASTS"", then C(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So I think ""SLANT"" is a solid choice.

Alternatively, ""PASTY"" is invalid because of A at 2.

Another word: ""MASON"" -> M(1), A(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). But A at position 2? Invalid.

""BASSO"" -> B(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So we avoid position 2 for A.

What about ""LASSO""? L(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5). Again, A at position 2? Invalid.

So we need a word without A at position 2 and without S at position 4.

""SLANT"" fits: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). S is at 1, A at 3, and position 4 is N (which is new).

We can also do ""SALON"": S(1), A(2), L(3), O(4), N(5). But A at position 2? Invalid.

""TALON"": T(1), A(2), L(3), O(4), N(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So ""SLANT"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""STANK"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), K(5). This is valid: S at 1, A at 3, and new letters T, N, K. But K is less common.

""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This is also valid: A at 3, and S is not in this word? But we know S must be in the word! So we cannot choose a word without S. We must include S.

Ah, important: we must include both A and S in the word because they are present.

So ""PLANT"" has A but not S? So that's invalid because we know S is in the word.

Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has A and S? A at 1, S at 5: yes.

""SLANT"" has S at 1 and A at 3: yes.

""STANK"" has S at 1 and A at 3: yes.

But ""STANK"" has K, which is less common. So ""SLANT"" or ""ATOMS"" might be better.

Between ""SLANT"" and ""ATOMS"", which one?

""SLANT"": letters S, L, A, N, T -> all common.
""ATOMS"": A, T, O, M, S -> also common.

We might want to avoid less common letters. Both are fine.

But note: in ""SLANT"", we are testing L, N, T. In ""ATOMS"", we are testing T, O, M.

We haven't tested any of these, so both are good.

I think ""SLANT"" is a good choice because it tests S at position 1 and A at position 3, which are positions we haven't tried for these letters.

We can also consider ""SALTY"", but S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So I'll go with ""SLANT"".

But let's confirm: the word must be 5 letters, English, and not use R, I, E.

""SLANT"": S, L, A, N, T -> no R, I, E. And A is at position 3 (not 2), S at position 1 (not 4). Good.

We could also do ""SNAPS"": S(1), N(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). This has A at 3 (good), S at 1 and 5? But we don't know if S appears twice. However, we are testing S at two positions: 1 and 5. But we already know S is in the word, so if we get a '-' for S at position 1 and/or 5, that tells us about the position. But if we get a 'x' for one of them, it might be confusing? Actually, if we get a 'x' for S at position 1, that means S is not at position 1, but we know S is in the word so it must be elsewhere. Similarly for position 5. But we are using two S's, which might be inefficient if the word has only one S.

But it's acceptable. However, ""SNAPS"" has P and S at position 4? Position 4: we know that in the first guess, position 4 was S and it was wrong, but that doesn't prevent us from putting another letter at position 4. In fact, we are putting P at position 4? The word is S(1), N(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). So position 4 is P, which is new.

But we are using two S's. Since we have limited guesses, it might be better to use five distinct letters to test more letters. But ""SLANT"" has distinct letters: S, L, A, N, T. Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has A, T, O, M, S -> distinct.

""SNAPS"" has two S's, so we are testing only four distinct letters: S, N, A, P.

So for information gain, distinct letters are better.

Therefore, ""SLANT"" or ""ATOMS"" are better.

I think I'll go with ""SLANT"".

So the next guess: SLANT.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, I, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A and S **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A cannot be in position 2, and S cannot be in position 4.

For the second guess:
- The word must include A and S, but avoid positions 2 for A and 4 for S.
- It must exclude R, I, and E entirely.
- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (like T, N, L) and place A and S in new positions not yet ruled out.

The word ""slant"" fits these criteria:
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so allowed).
- A is in position 3 (not 2, so allowed).
- It includes new common letters: L, N, T.
- It avoids R, I, E.
- All letters are distinct, which helps test more possibilities efficiently.

This guess will provide feedback on S at position 1, A at position 3, and the new letters L, N, T, helping narrow down the secret word.",Guess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, the user wants me to make the first guess in a Wordle-like game. Since it's the first attempt, I don't have any feedback to work with yet. I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain – ideally covering common letters and a mix of vowels/consonants. 

English vowels are A, E, I, O, U (sometimes Y). Among these, E and A are statistically the most common. For consonants, R, S, T, L, N are frequent. I recall ""ROATE"" is a popular starter among word game enthusiasts because it packs three vowels (O, A, E) and two common consonants (R, T). Hmm, but ""RAISE"" has the same advantages with S instead of T – and S is also very common. Which is better? Let me compare:

ROATE: R, O, A, T, E → Vowels: O, A, E (3), Consonants: R, T (2).  
RAISE: R, A, I, S, E → Vowels: A, I, E (3), Consonants: R, S (2).

Both cover 3 vowels and 2 high-frequency consonants. However, S appears more often than T in English words. Also, if the secret word has plural forms, S might be extra useful. Plus, I gets used more than O. So RAISE seems slightly superior for coverage.

Wait – is RAISE valid? Absolutely, it's a noun meaning to lift up. No exotic letters either, so it should be accepted. Confirming: R-A-I-S-E. Yep!

The goal here is to cast a wide net. RAISE tests R (most common consonant), three top vowels (A, I, E), and S (another top consonant). Whatever feedback comes back – whether greens, yellows, or grays – will immediately narrow down possibilities significantly. For instance:

- If S is correct/green, possibilities shrink dramatically.  
- If E is yellow, I know it's present but misplaced.  
- Even all grays would reveal those five are absent, which is valuable early on.

No point overthinking for a first guess. RAISE is methodically optimal. Let's go with that.For my first guess, I need a word that maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback. I'll choose a word with common letters (vowels and frequent consonants) to cover broad possibilities. A good starting word often includes letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, A, and O. After considering options like ""ROATE"" or ""CRANE"", I select ""RAISE"" – it uses three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), all frequently appearing in English words. This should provide solid initial clues regardless of the secret word.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
I: x (not in the word)
S: - (in the word but wrong position)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and S, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"" (position 2 for A and position 4 for S).
- The letters R, I, and E are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain R, I, E.
- Contains A and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

We also know that A and S are in the word, so we can try to place them in other positions.

Possible positions for A: since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, S was in position 4 and that was wrong, so it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We also need to avoid R, I, E.

Let's think of words that have A and S, and avoid R, I, E.

Common letters we can use: we have A and S already. We can try to use other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are O, U (and sometimes Y). Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that has A and S, and three new letters that are not R, I, E.

We also want to test new positions for A and S.

For example, we can try putting A in position 1 and S in position 3? Or A in position 3 and S in position 1? We have to see what words exist.

Let me think of words that have A and S, and no R, I, E.

Some possibilities:
- A at the start: A _ _ S _ -> but we need to avoid E at the end? Words like ""aunts"" but that has U, N, T, S. But we have to avoid E? ""aunts"" doesn't have E, R, I? Let's check: A, U, N, T, S -> no R, I, E. But we have S at the end? In our feedback, S was in position 4 and was wrong, but now we are putting S at position 5? That's allowed because it's a different position.

But note: we have two letters we know: A and S. We also have three more letters to choose.

We can also consider words with A and S in other positions.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word (but not at position 2) and S is in the word (but not at position 4), we can try to put A in position 1 and S in position 5? Or A in position 3 and S in position 1? etc.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: A in position 1, S in position 5: words like ""atoms"" (but has O, M, T) -> but we don't know if O, M, T are allowed? They are not forbidden yet. However, ""atoms"" has O and M, which are new.

But we also have to avoid R, I, E. ""atoms"" doesn't have R, I, E? A, T, O, M, S -> no R, I, E. So it's okay.

Option 2: A in position 1, S in position 3: words like ""tasks"" (but that has two S's? and T, K) -> but we don't know if K is allowed. Also, ""tasks"" has two S's? T, A, S, K, S? Actually, ""tasks"" is T-A-S-K-S? That's 5 letters: T (1), A (2), S (3), K (4), S (5). But we have S at position 3 and 5? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. But in our case, we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or twice. However, in the feedback for ""raise"", we only had one S and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If the word had two S's, then we would have gotten two '-' for S? But we only had one S in ""raise"", so we only got one feedback for S. So it's possible that the word has two S's? But we don't know.

But in ""tasks"", we have A at position 2? But we are trying to put A in position 1? So that doesn't work.

We want A in position 1: so first letter A.

Words starting with A, containing S, and no R, I, E.

Examples:
- ALOES -> but has E? E is forbidden. So no.
- ATOLL -> no S? doesn't have S.
- ATOMS: A (1), T (2), O (3), M (4), S (5) -> no R, I, E. And S is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed). A is at position 1 (not 2, so allowed). This seems good.

Another: AULOS -> but U, L, O, S? A (1), U (2), L (3), O (4), S (5). No R, I, E. Also valid? Aulos is a musical instrument, but might be obscure.

Another: AUNTS: A (1), U (2), N (3), T (4), S (5). Common word.

We can also try S at the start? But we don't know if S can be at the start? It wasn't in position 4, but we can try position 1.

For example, S in position 1 and A in position 3: words like ""stain"" but has I? I is forbidden. ""stare"" has E? forbidden. ""scalp"" has C, A, L, P -> S (1), C (2), A (3), L (4), P (5). A is at position 3 (not 2, allowed) and S at position 1 (not 4, allowed). And no R, I, E. So ""scalp"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""shalt"" has H, A, L, T -> S (1), H (2), A (3), L (4), T (5). No R, I, E.

But we have to choose one.

We also want to cover new letters to get more information.

In the first guess, we used: R, A, I, S, E -> we know R, I, E are absent, and A and S are present.

So for the second guess, we want to test A and S in new positions, and also test new letters.

We have 5 positions. We can try to put A and S in positions that we haven't tried and that are allowed.

In the first guess, A was in position 2 (wrong) and S in position 4 (wrong). So we can try A in 1,3,5 and S in 1,2,3,5.

But we also want to avoid positions that are already known to be wrong for these letters? Actually, we don't know about other positions. We only know that position 2 is wrong for A and position 4 is wrong for S.

We can try to cover as many new positions as possible for A and S.

Also, we want to include common letters that we haven't tested: like T, N, O, L, etc.

Let me list some candidate words:

1. ATOMS: A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4), S(5) -> tests A at 1 (new), S at 5 (new). Also tests T, O, M which are new.

2. AUNTS: A(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> tests A at 1, S at 5. New letters: U, N, T.

3. SCALP: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), P(5) -> tests S at 1 (new), A at 3 (new). New letters: C, L, P.

4. SHALT: S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), T(5) -> similar to above, but with H and T.

5. PASTA: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5) -> but A is at position 2? We know that position 2 is wrong for A? So we cannot put A at position 2 again? Because we already know it's not there. So that would be a waste. Also, we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, putting A at position 2 again is not useful because we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 2 for A and position 4 for S.

Therefore, in PASTA, A is at position 2 and 5. Position 2 is forbidden for A, so we shouldn't do that. Also, S is at position 3? That's okay, but A at position 2 is invalid.

So we avoid words that put A at position 2 or S at position 4.

Now, among the candidates, which one gives the most information?

We want to test letters that are common and we haven't tried. We haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, M, P, H, etc.

ATOMS: tests T, O, M
AUNTS: tests U, N, T
SCALP: tests C, L, P
SHALT: tests H, L, T

T is a very common letter, so it might be good to include T.

Similarly, N and L are common.

We can also consider words that put A and S in positions that are more central to get more information about the middle.

But let's choose a word that uses common letters and avoids obscure ones.

Another candidate: ""TASKS"" -> but T(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5). But A is at position 2? We know A is not at position 2, so that's invalid.

""PASTY"" -> P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). Again, A at position 2: invalid.

""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This seems good: S at 1 (not 4), A at 3 (not 2). New letters: L, N, T. And no R, I, E.

Similarly, ""PLANS"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), S(5). But S is at position 5? That's okay. But we have A at 3 and S at 5.

""SLANT"" is a good candidate: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). It tests S at position 1, A at position 3, and new letters L, N, T.

We also avoid position 2 for A and position 4 for S? In this word, S is at 1 (not 4) and A is at 3 (not 2). Also, position 4 is N, which is new.

But note: in the feedback, we know that position 4 was S in the first guess and it was wrong, but that doesn't mean that position 4 cannot be another letter. We are free to put any letter at position 4.

So ""SLANT"" is valid.

Similarly, ""SALTS"": S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), S(5). But A is at position 2? That's not allowed because we know A is not at position 2. So invalid.

""OASIS"": O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5). But A at position 2? Invalid. Also, I is forbidden.

So back to ""SLANT"" and ""ATOMS"".

I think ""SLANT"" is a good choice because it tests S at the start and A in the middle, and common letters L, N, T.

Another option: ""SONAR"" but has R? R is forbidden.

""SAUCE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), C(4), E(5). But A at position 2? Invalid and E is forbidden.

So let's go with ""SLANT"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""SLANT"" is a valid English word.

We can also consider ""Casts"" but that has C, A, S, T, S -> but if we spell it as ""CASTS"", then C(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So I think ""SLANT"" is a solid choice.

Alternatively, ""PASTY"" is invalid because of A at 2.

Another word: ""MASON"" -> M(1), A(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). But A at position 2? Invalid.

""BASSO"" -> B(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So we avoid position 2 for A.

What about ""LASSO""? L(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5). Again, A at position 2? Invalid.

So we need a word without A at position 2 and without S at position 4.

""SLANT"" fits: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). S is at 1, A at 3, and position 4 is N (which is new).

We can also do ""SALON"": S(1), A(2), L(3), O(4), N(5). But A at position 2? Invalid.

""TALON"": T(1), A(2), L(3), O(4), N(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So ""SLANT"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""STANK"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), K(5). This is valid: S at 1, A at 3, and new letters T, N, K. But K is less common.

""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This is also valid: A at 3, and S is not in this word? But we know S must be in the word! So we cannot choose a word without S. We must include S.

Ah, important: we must include both A and S in the word because they are present.

So ""PLANT"" has A but not S? So that's invalid because we know S is in the word.

Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has A and S? A at 1, S at 5: yes.

""SLANT"" has S at 1 and A at 3: yes.

""STANK"" has S at 1 and A at 3: yes.

But ""STANK"" has K, which is less common. So ""SLANT"" or ""ATOMS"" might be better.

Between ""SLANT"" and ""ATOMS"", which one?

""SLANT"": letters S, L, A, N, T -> all common.
""ATOMS"": A, T, O, M, S -> also common.

We might want to avoid less common letters. Both are fine.

But note: in ""SLANT"", we are testing L, N, T. In ""ATOMS"", we are testing T, O, M.

We haven't tested any of these, so both are good.

I think ""SLANT"" is a good choice because it tests S at position 1 and A at position 3, which are positions we haven't tried for these letters.

We can also consider ""SALTY"", but S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So I'll go with ""SLANT"".

But let's confirm: the word must be 5 letters, English, and not use R, I, E.

""SLANT"": S, L, A, N, T -> no R, I, E. And A is at position 3 (not 2), S at position 1 (not 4). Good.

We could also do ""SNAPS"": S(1), N(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). This has A at 3 (good), S at 1 and 5? But we don't know if S appears twice. However, we are testing S at two positions: 1 and 5. But we already know S is in the word, so if we get a '-' for S at position 1 and/or 5, that tells us about the position. But if we get a 'x' for one of them, it might be confusing? Actually, if we get a 'x' for S at position 1, that means S is not at position 1, but we know S is in the word so it must be elsewhere. Similarly for position 5. But we are using two S's, which might be inefficient if the word has only one S.

But it's acceptable. However, ""SNAPS"" has P and S at position 4? Position 4: we know that in the first guess, position 4 was S and it was wrong, but that doesn't prevent us from putting another letter at position 4. In fact, we are putting P at position 4? The word is S(1), N(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). So position 4 is P, which is new.

But we are using two S's. Since we have limited guesses, it might be better to use five distinct letters to test more letters. But ""SLANT"" has distinct letters: S, L, A, N, T. Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has A, T, O, M, S -> distinct.

""SNAPS"" has two S's, so we are testing only four distinct letters: S, N, A, P.

So for information gain, distinct letters are better.

Therefore, ""SLANT"" or ""ATOMS"" are better.

I think I'll go with ""SLANT"".

So the next guess: SLANT.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, I, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A and S **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A cannot be in position 2, and S cannot be in position 4.

For the second guess:
- The word must include A and S, but avoid positions 2 for A and 4 for S.
- It must exclude R, I, and E entirely.
- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (like T, N, L) and place A and S in new positions not yet ruled out.

The word ""slant"" fits these criteria:
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so allowed).
- A is in position 3 (not 2, so allowed).
- It includes new common letters: L, N, T.
- It avoids R, I, E.
- All letters are distinct, which helps test more possibilities efficiently.

This guess will provide feedback on S at position 1, A at position 3, and the new letters L, N, T, helping narrow down the secret word.

Since it\'s the first attempt, I don\'t have any feedback to work with yet. I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain – ideally covering common letters and a mix of vowels/consonants. \n\nEnglish vowels are A, E, I, O, U (sometimes Y). Among these, E and A are statistically the most common. For consonants, R, S, T, L, N are frequent. I recall ""ROATE"" is a popular starter among word game enthusiasts because it packs three vowels (O, A, E) and two common consonants (R, T). Hmm, but ""RAISE"" has the same advantages with S instead of T – and S is also very common. Which is better? Let me compare:\n\nROATE: R, O, A, T, E → Vowels: O, A, E (3), Consonants: R, T (2).  \nRAISE: R, A, I, S, E → Vowels: A, I, E (3), Consonants: R, S (2).\n\nBoth cover 3 vowels and 2 high-frequency consonants. However, S appears more often than T in English words. Also, if the secret word has plural forms, S might be extra useful. Plus, I gets used more than O. So RAISE seems slightly superior for coverage.\n\nWait – is RAISE valid? Absolutely, it\'s a noun meaning to lift up. No exotic letters either, so it should be accepted. Confirming: R-A-I-S-E. Yep!\n\nThe goal here is to cast a wide net. RAISE tests R (most common consonant), three top vowels (A, I, E), and S (another top consonant). Whatever feedback comes back – whether greens, yellows, or grays – will immediately narrow down possibilities significantly. For instance:\n\n- If S is correct/green, possibilities shrink dramatically.  \n- If E is yellow, I know it\'s present but misplaced.  \n- Even all grays would reveal those five are absent, which is valuable early on.\n\nNo point overthinking for a first guess. RAISE is methodically optimal. Let\'s go with that.For my first guess, I need a word that maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback. I\'ll choose a word with common letters (vowels and frequent consonants) to cover broad possibilities. A good starting word often includes letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, A, and O. After considering options like ""ROATE"" or ""CRANE"", I select ""RAISE"" – it uses three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), all frequently appearing in English words. This should provide solid initial clues regardless of the secret word.\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":\nR: x (not in the word)\nA: - (in the word but wrong position)\nI: x (not in the word)\nS: - (in the word but wrong position)\nE: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word contains the letters A and S, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"" (position 2 for A and position 4 for S).\n- The letters R, I, and E are not in the word at all.\n\nWe must choose a new 5-letter word that:\n- Does not contain R, I, E.\n- Contains A and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.\n\nWe also know that A and S are in the word, so we can try to place them in other positions.\n\nPossible positions for A: since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\nSimilarly, S was in position 4 and that was wrong, so it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nWe also need to avoid R, I, E.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A and S, and avoid R, I, E.\n\nCommon letters we can use: we have A and S already.

Words like ""aunts"" but that has U, N, T, S. But we have to avoid E? ""aunts"" doesn\'t have E, R, I? Let\'s check: A, U, N, T, S -> no R, I, E. But we have S at the end? In our feedback, S was in position 4 and was wrong, but now we are putting S at position 5? That\'s allowed because it\'s a different position.\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know: A and S. We also have three more letters to choose.\n\nWe can also consider words with A and S in other positions.\n\nAnother idea: since we know A is in the word (but not at position 2) and S is in the word (but not at position 4), we can try to put A in position 1 and S in position 5? Or A in position 3 and S in position 1? etc.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\nOption 1: A in position 1, S in position 5: words like ""atoms"" (but has O, M, T) -> but we don\'t know if O, M, T are allowed? They are not forbidden yet. However, ""atoms"" has O and M, which are new.\n\nBut we also have to avoid R, I, E. ""atoms"" doesn\'t have R, I, E? A, T, O, M, S -> no R, I, E. So it\'s okay.\n\nOption 2: A in position 1, S in position 3: words like ""tasks"" (but that has two S\'s? and T, K) -> but we don\'t know if K is allowed. Also, ""tasks"" has two S\'s? T, A, S, K, S? Actually, ""tasks"" is T-A-S-K-S? That\'s 5 letters: T (1), A (2), S (3), K (4), S (5). But we have S at position 3 and 5? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. But in our case, we know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears once or twice. However, in the feedback for ""raise"", we only had one S and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If the word had two S\'s, then we would have gotten two \'-\' for S? But we only had one S in ""raise"", so we only got one feedback for S. So it\'s possible that the word has two S\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""tasks"", we have A at position 2? But we are trying to put A in position 1? So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe want A in position 1: so first letter A.\n\nWords starting with A, containing S, and no R, I, E.\n\nExamples:\n- ALOES -> but has E? E is forbidden. So no.\n- ATOLL -> no S? doesn\'t have S.\n- ATOMS: A (1), T (2), O (3), M (4), S (5) -> no R, I, E. And S is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed). A is at position 1 (not 2, so allowed). This seems good.\n\nAnother: AULOS -> but U, L, O, S? A (1), U (2), L (3), O (4), S (5). No R, I, E. Also valid? Aulos is a musical instrument, but might be obscure.\n\nAnother: AUNTS: A (1), U (2), N (3), T (4), S (5). Common word.\n\nWe can also try S at the start? But we don\'t know if S can be at the start? It wasn\'t in position 4, but we can try position 1.\n\nFor example, S in position 1 and A in position 3: words like ""stain"" but has I? I is forbidden. ""stare"" has E? forbidden. ""scalp"" has C, A, L, P -> S (1), C (2), A (3), L (4), P (5). A is at position 3 (not 2, allowed) and S at position 1 (not 4, allowed). And no R, I, E. So ""scalp"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""shalt"" has H, A, L, T -> S (1), H (2), A (3), L (4), T (5).

So ""SLANT"" or ""ATOMS"" might be better.\n\nBetween ""SLANT"" and ""ATOMS"", which one?\n\n""SLANT"": letters S, L, A, N, T -> all common.\n""ATOMS"": A, T, O, M, S -> also common.\n\nWe might want to avoid less common letters. Both are fine.\n\nBut note: in ""SLANT"", we are testing L, N, T. In ""ATOMS"", we are testing T, O, M.\n\nWe haven\'t tested any of these, so both are good.\n\nI think ""SLANT"" is a good choice because it tests S at position 1 and A at position 3, which are positions we haven\'t tried for these letters.\n\nWe can also consider ""SALTY"", but S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5). A at position 2? Invalid.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SLANT"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: the word must be 5 letters, English, and not use R, I, E.\n\n""SLANT"": S, L, A, N, T -> no R, I, E. And A is at position 3 (not 2), S at position 1 (not 4). Good.\n\nWe could also do ""SNAPS"": S(1), N(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). This has A at 3 (good), S at 1 and 5? But we don\'t know if S appears twice. However, we are testing S at two positions: 1 and 5. But we already know S is in the word, so if we get a \'-\' for S at position 1 and/or 5, that tells us about the position. But if we get a \'x\' for one of them, it might be confusing? Actually, if we get a \'x\' for S at position 1, that means S is not at position 1, but we know S is in the word so it must be elsewhere. Similarly for position 5. But we are using two S\'s, which might be inefficient if the word has only one S.\n\nBut it\'s acceptable. However, ""SNAPS"" has P and S at position 4? Position 4: we know that in the first guess, position 4 was S and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t prevent us from putting another letter at position 4. In fact, we are putting P at position 4? The word is S(1), N(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). So position 4 is P, which is new.\n\nBut we are using two S\'s. Since we have limited guesses, it might be better to use five distinct letters to test more letters. But ""SLANT"" has distinct letters: S, L, A, N, T. Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has A, T, O, M, S -> distinct.\n\n""SNAPS"" has two S\'s, so we are testing only four distinct letters: S, N, A, P.\n\nSo for information gain, distinct letters are better.\n\nTherefore, ""SLANT"" or ""ATOMS"" are better.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""SLANT"".\n\nSo the next guess: SLANT.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R, I, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- A and S **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A cannot be in position 2, and S cannot be in position 4.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include A and S, but avoid positions 2 for A and 4 for S.\n- It must exclude R, I, and E entirely.\n- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (like T, N, L) and place A and S in new positions not yet ruled out.\n\nThe word ""slant"" fits these criteria:\n- S is in position 1 (not 4, so allowed).\n- A is in position 3 (not 2, so allowed).\n- It includes new common letters: L, N, T.\n- It avoids R, I, E.\n- All letters are distinct, which helps test more possibilities efficiently.\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on S at position 1, A at position 3, and the new letters L, N, T, helping narrow down the secret word.\n\n<guess>slant</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
First, I need to review the feedback from both guesses to understand what I know about the secret word.

From Guess 1 (raise):
- R: x → R is not in the word.
- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I: x → I is not in the word.
- S: - → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E: x → E is not in the word.

So, after Guess 1, I know:
- The secret word contains A and S, but A is not in position 2, and S is not in position 4.
- R, I, E are absent.

From Guess 2 (slant):
- S: ✓ → S is in the word and in the correct position, position 1.
- L: - → L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A: ✓ → A is in the word and in the correct position, position 3.
- N: x → N is not in the word.
- T: x → T is not in the word.

So, combining this with Guess 1 feedback:
- S is in position 1 (confirmed by ✓ in slant).
- A is in position 3 (confirmed by ✓ in slant).
- L is present but not in position 2 (since it got ""-"" in slant).
- N and T are absent (both x).
- Also, R, I, E are absent from before.

Now, I know the secret word has:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- L is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2. Since positions 1 and 3 are taken, L must be in position 2, 4, or 5, but position 2 is not possible because the feedback from slant says L is not in position 2 (given ""-""). So L is in position 4 or 5.

Feedback shows L: -, which means L is present but wrong position. In slant, L was in position 2, so position 2 is incorrect for L. Therefore, L could be in position 4 or 5 (since position 1 and 3 are occupied).

Also, we have three positions to determine: positions 2, 4, and 5.
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: ? (but not L, and not any absent letters)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: ? 
- Position 5: ?

The word must contain L, and L is not in position 2. So L is in position 4 or 5.

Additionally, from absent letters: R, I, E, N, T are all not in the word.

Letters not used yet that could be in: I, E, R are out, N and T are out from Guess 2.

Letters excluded so far: from Guess 1: R, I, E; from Guess 2: N, T. So excluded: R,I,E,N,T.

Common letters that might still be possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

But since L is present, and S and A are fixed, the word has S, A, L, and two other letters.

The secret word is 5 letters: position 1: S, position 3: A, and L somewhere, plus two more characters.

Since L must be placed, and it's not position 2, it's in 4 or 5.

Let me denote the possibilities.

Assume L is in position 4. Then positions would be:
1: S
2: ?
3: A
4: L
5: ?

Or L in position 5:
1: S
2: ?
3: A
4: ?
5: L

Now, position 2 needs a letter that is not excluded. Excluded letters: R,I,E,N,T.

Also, since L got ""-"" in position 2, but position 2 is empty now, so whatever goes there should not be L, which we know.

Now, I need to guess a new word that fits what I know and tests possibilities.

My new guess must:
- Have S in position 1 (since it's confirmed).
- Have A in position 3 (confirmed).
- Include L (since it's in the word), but not in position 2 (and not in position 1 or 3 for that matter), so L should be in position 4 or 5.
- Exclude R,I,E,N,T.
- Position 2 should be a new letter to test.

Moreover, I should avoid using letters that are excluded.

Possible words:

First, let's list English words that start with S, have A in position 3, and contain L.

Position 1: S, position 3: A, and L present.

Examples:

- If L is in position 4: S _ A L _

Words like: SCALP, SCALD, etc., but need to check letters.

SCALP: S, C, A, L, P → positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:A, 4:L, 5:P

But letters: C and P are new, not excluded.

SCALD: S, C, A, L, D → similar, with D.

- If L is in position 5: S _ A _ L

Words like: SHALE, but H and E; E is excluded, so not allowed. SHALE has E.

STALE: has T, but T is excluded.

SPALE? Not a word.

SABLE: S, A, B, L, E → but position 3 is B? No: S (1), A (2?), but in our case position 3 must be A, so S _ A _ L. So word must have second letter anything, position 3 A, position 5 L.

Sable is S-A-B-L-E? S (1), A (2), B (3), L (4), E (5) — but we need position 3 to be A, not position 2. Position 2 here is A, but we know position 2 cannot be A? No, from Guess 1, A cannot be in position 2, but position 2 could be something else.

In secret word, position 2 is unknown, but A is at position 3, so position 2 is not A.

For words with S at 1, position 3 A, and L at 5: S _ A _ L

Examples: SHALL, but SHALL has two L's? S,H,A,L,L? Position 5 is L, but it has L at position 4 too? SHALL is S-H-A-L-L, so positions correspond as needed: S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), L(5). Position 4 and 5 both L? But in this case, L at position 4 or 5.

But SHALL has a repeated L, and position 4 is L.

Another word: SNAIL, but N and I are excluded. N is excluded from Guess 2.

SKYAL? Not a word.

SWAYL? Not a word.

Possible words: SMAWL? Not common.

Perhaps not many with L at position 5.

Other options: SCALY, but SCALY has Y, and position: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), Y(5) — so L at position 4.

SCALY is a word.

So back to when L is at position 4: like SCAL something.

SCALP, SCALD, SCALY, etc.

With L at position 5: harder. SHALL as I thought, but SHALL has position 4: L, position 5: L? In SHALL, it's S-H-A-L-L, so index: 1:S,2:H,3:A,4:L,5:L. So L at position 4 and 5.

If secret word has SHALL, feedback for slant: slant was S,L,A,N,T → position 4 was N, which got x, so if secret word was SHALL, position 4 is L, not N, so x is correct. Position 2 L in slant got -, meaning L is present but not at 2; in SHALL, L is at 4 and 5, so L is present. But we don't know if L is multiple.

SHALL might be possible.

But SHALL has E? No, SHALL is not SHALE. SHALL is S-H-A-L-L, no E.

SPALL? SPALL means to chip or flake off, S-P-A-L-L, which has position: S(1),P(2),A(3),L(4),L(5). Again repeated L.

But SPALL might not be common; Wordle usually uses common words.

Standard words: SCALP is more common.

SWALY? Not a word.

So perhaps few options with L at position 5, and often with repeated letters.

But we have to consider both cases.

Now, for the guess, I need to make a word that fits known constraints and tests the position of L.

One way is to assume L might be at position 4 and guess a word like SCALP or SCALE, but SCALE has E, excluded.

SCALD: S,C,A,L,D

Or SCAWL? Not a word.

Another word: SHALY? Not common.

Perhaps better to focus on L at position 4 for simplicity.

But I need to decide my guess.

Since L could be at position 4 or 5, I should guess a word that has L in one of those positions to test.

For example, if I guess SCALP, L is at position 4.

If the secret word has L at position 5, this might not be exact, but feedback will tell.

Similarly, if I guess SHALL, L at both 4 and 5, but messy.

List of possible secret words based on current info.

Secret word: S _ A _ _

With _ containing L and another letter? Positions: 2,4,5 need letters.

Known: L is in the word, so one of position 4 or 5 has L, or both? But possibly only one L.

Position 2 is separate.

Letters must be from non-excluded set: excluding R,I,E,N,T.

So available letters: B,C,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,U,V,W,Y,Z, etc.

But common ones.

Possible words:

First, if L at position 4: S _ A L _

Then position 2 and 5: e.g., SCALY: S C A L Y → position 2:C, position 5:Y

SCALP: S C A L P → P at 5

SCALD: S C A L D → D at 5

SHALY? S H A L Y → but SHALY might not be common; SHALY is an adjective, bit obscure.

SHALL: S H A L L → but here position 4:L, position 5:L, so both filled.

SWALY? Not word.

With other letters: S B A L M? Not word.

S F A L K? No.

So limited: S_CAL_ words like SCALP, SCALD, SCALY.

Now, if L at position 5: S _ A _ L

Then position 2 and 4: e.g., SHALL which also has position 4:L, but then it's S _ A L L, so L at both.

Otherwise, S P A I L, but I excluded.

S C A S L? Not.

S K A I L, I excluded.

SABLE: but S A B L E, positions: S(1),A(2),B(3),L(4),E(5) — but we need position 3 to be A, but here position 2 is A, which we know cannot be, from Guess 1 feedback A not at position 2.

Similarly, most words with S _ A _ L will have position 3 not A if position 2 is not vowel or something.

Direct words: STALL, but T excluded.

S M A L L: S M A L L → position 2:M, position 3:A, position 4:L, position 5:L. But L at 4 and 5.

SHALL: S H A L L

SWALL? Not, but SWOLL? Not common.

So possible secret words could be SCALP, SCALD, SHALL, SMALL, etc.

But SMALL has M.

For the guess, I need to choose a new word that incorporates what I know.

My new guess should have:
- Position 1: S (must)
- Position 3: A (must)
- Include L, but not at position 2 (since we know it's wrong there, and not at 1 or 3 for obvious reasons), so L at 4 or 5.
- Cover new letters.

Also, avoid using excluded letters: R,I,E,N,T.

So, a good guess might be SCALP: which has S, C, A, L, P.
- Position: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), P(5)
- This tests C and P, and places L at position 4.

If the secret word has L at position 4, this might confirm.
If not, for example if L is at position 5, then SCALP might give feedback telling us.

Similarly, I could guess SHALL: S,H,A,L,L, but repeated L might be less informative.

Another possibility: using L at position 5, like ""S K A L K"" not word.

I think SCALP is a reasonable choice.

But there's another word: ""SALAD"" — but position: S,A,L,A,D. Position 1:S, position 2:A, but A at position 2 is invalid because we know from Guess 1 that A is not at position 2. So cannot use SALAD.

Similarly, ""SCAMP"": S,C,A,M,P — S(1),C(2),A(3),M(4),P(5). This has no L? But L is in the word, so my guess must include L to confirm or test, but actually, I can choose any word, but to be consistent, if I omit L, I might not learn about its position.

Better to include L in the guess to get feedback on its position.

In SCALP, L is included at position 4.

SCAMP does not have L, so feedback wouldn't tell me about L's position.

Since I know L is present, I should keep it in the guess to find where it is.

So SCALP includes L.

SHALL includes L.

But SHALL has repeated L.

SCALD: S,C,A,L,D

Or SCALY: S,C,A,L,Y

All fine.

I'll go with SCALP as it's common and tests new letters C and P.

Position 2 is C, which I haven't tested before.

Similarly, position 5 P.

Feedback will tell if C or P are in the word.

Now, make the guess.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Review feedback from previous guesses**:
   - **Guess 1: ""raise"" → Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)**  
     - R, I, E are not in the secret word.
     - A and S are present but in wrong positions: A ≠ position 2, S ≠ position 4.
   - **Guess 2: ""slant"" → Feedback: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)**  
     - S is correct in position 1 (fixed).
     - A is correct in position 3 (fixed).
     - L is present but not in position 2.
     - N and T are not in the word.
   - Summary:
     - Known correct positions: S at position 1, A at position 3.
     - Known present letters: L must be in the word, but not in position 2 (from ""slant"" feedback), so L is in position 4 or 5.
     - Absent letters: R, I, E, N, T (excluded from consideration).
     - Secret word structure: S _ A _ _, where positions 2, 4, 5 need letters, with L in position 4 or 5.

2. **Constraints for the new guess**:
   - Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
   - Position 1 must be S (confirmed).
   - Position 3 must be A (confirmed).
   - Must include L (since it's present), but L cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3 (position 1 and 3 are fixed, position 2 is wrong per feedback), so L should be placed in position 4 or 5 to test its location.
   - Cannot use R, I, E, N, T (excluded letters).
   - Should focus on common remaining letters to maximize information: e.g., C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

3. **Generate possible words**:
   - Since S and A are fixed, and L must be included, brainstorm words starting with S, with A in position 3, and containing L not in positions 1-3:
     - If L is in position 4: Words like SCALP (S, C, A, L, P), SCALD (S, C, A, L, D), or SCALY (S, C, A, L, Y).
     - If L is in position 5: Words like SHALL (S, H, A, L, L) or SMALL (S, M, A, L, L), but these have repeated L, which might be less informative.
     - Words must avoid excluded letters (R, I, E, N, T) and position 2 cannot be A (from Guess 1 feedback).

4. **Select the best guess**:
   - ""SCALP"" is a strong choice because:
     - It fits the structure: S (position 1), C (position 2, new letter to test), A (position 3), L (position 4, tests if L is here), P (position 5, new letter).
     - It uses distinct letters (no repeats), which tests more possibilities efficiently: C and P are new common letters to check.
     - Feedback from ""SCALP"" will clarify:
       - Whether C is in the word and correctly placed (if ✓, C is correct at position 2; if -, C is present but wrong position; if x, C absent).
       - Whether L is correctly placed at position 4 (if ✓, L is fixed at position 4; if -, L is present but position 4 is wrong, confirming L must be at position 5).
       - Whether P is in the word.
     - Alternative words like SCALD (ends with D) or SCALY (ends with Y) are less common or might cover fewer common letters.
   - Avoid words with repeated letters like SHALL (S, H, A, L, L) or SMALL (S, M, A, L, L), as they provide less information about other letters due to duplication.

5. **Decision**:
   - Guess ""SCALP"" to efficiently test position 4 for L, introduce new letters (C and P), and confirm/refine the word structure based on feedback.

<guess>scalp</guess>",scalp,"First, I need to review the feedback from both guesses to understand what I know about the secret word.

From Guess 1 (raise):
- R: x → R is not in the word.
- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I: x → I is not in the word.
- S: - → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E: x → E is not in the word.

So, after Guess 1, I know:
- The secret word contains A and S, but A is not in position 2, and S is not in position 4.
- R, I, E are absent.

From Guess 2 (slant):
- S: ✓ → S is in the word and in the correct position, position 1.
- L: - → L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A: ✓ → A is in the word and in the correct position, position 3.
- N: x → N is not in the word.
- T: x → T is not in the word.

So, combining this with Guess 1 feedback:
- S is in position 1 (confirmed by ✓ in slant).
- A is in position 3 (confirmed by ✓ in slant).
- L is present but not in position 2 (since it got ""-"" in slant).
- N and T are absent (both x).
- Also, R, I, E are absent from before.

Now, I know the secret word has:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- L is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2. Since positions 1 and 3 are taken, L must be in position 2, 4, or 5, but position 2 is not possible because the feedback from slant says L is not in position 2 (given ""-""). So L is in position 4 or 5.

Feedback shows L: -, which means L is present but wrong position. In slant, L was in position 2, so position 2 is incorrect for L. Therefore, L could be in position 4 or 5 (since position 1 and 3 are occupied).

Also, we have three positions to determine: positions 2, 4, and 5.
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: ? (but not L, and not any absent letters)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: ? 
- Position 5: ?

The word must contain L, and L is not in position 2. So L is in position 4 or 5.

Additionally, from absent letters: R, I, E, N, T are all not in the word.

Letters not used yet that could be in: I, E, R are out, N and T are out from Guess 2.

Letters excluded so far: from Guess 1: R, I, E; from Guess 2: N, T. So excluded: R,I,E,N,T.

Common letters that might still be possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

But since L is present, and S and A are fixed, the word has S, A, L, and two other letters.

The secret word is 5 letters: position 1: S, position 3: A, and L somewhere, plus two more characters.

Since L must be placed, and it's not position 2, it's in 4 or 5.

Let me denote the possibilities.

Assume L is in position 4. Then positions would be:
1: S
2: ?
3: A
4: L
5: ?

Or L in position 5:
1: S
2: ?
3: A
4: ?
5: L

Now, position 2 needs a letter that is not excluded. Excluded letters: R,I,E,N,T.

Also, since L got ""-"" in position 2, but position 2 is empty now, so whatever goes there should not be L, which we know.

Now, I need to guess a new word that fits what I know and tests possibilities.

My new guess must:
- Have S in position 1 (since it's confirmed).
- Have A in position 3 (confirmed).
- Include L (since it's in the word), but not in position 2 (and not in position 1 or 3 for that matter), so L should be in position 4 or 5.
- Exclude R,I,E,N,T.
- Position 2 should be a new letter to test.

Moreover, I should avoid using letters that are excluded.

Possible words:

First, let's list English words that start with S, have A in position 3, and contain L.

Position 1: S, position 3: A, and L present.

Examples:

- If L is in position 4: S _ A L _

Words like: SCALP, SCALD, etc., but need to check letters.

SCALP: S, C, A, L, P → positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:A, 4:L, 5:P

But letters: C and P are new, not excluded.

SCALD: S, C, A, L, D → similar, with D.

- If L is in position 5: S _ A _ L

Words like: SHALE, but H and E; E is excluded, so not allowed. SHALE has E.

STALE: has T, but T is excluded.

SPALE? Not a word.

SABLE: S, A, B, L, E → but position 3 is B? No: S (1), A (2?), but in our case position 3 must be A, so S _ A _ L. So word must have second letter anything, position 3 A, position 5 L.

Sable is S-A-B-L-E? S (1), A (2), B (3), L (4), E (5) — but we need position 3 to be A, not position 2. Position 2 here is A, but we know position 2 cannot be A? No, from Guess 1, A cannot be in position 2, but position 2 could be something else.

In secret word, position 2 is unknown, but A is at position 3, so position 2 is not A.

For words with S at 1, position 3 A, and L at 5: S _ A _ L

Examples: SHALL, but SHALL has two L's? S,H,A,L,L? Position 5 is L, but it has L at position 4 too? SHALL is S-H-A-L-L, so positions correspond as needed: S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), L(5). Position 4 and 5 both L? But in this case, L at position 4 or 5.

But SHALL has a repeated L, and position 4 is L.

Another word: SNAIL, but N and I are excluded. N is excluded from Guess 2.

SKYAL? Not a word.

SWAYL? Not a word.

Possible words: SMAWL? Not common.

Perhaps not many with L at position 5.

Other options: SCALY, but SCALY has Y, and position: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), Y(5) — so L at position 4.

SCALY is a word.

So back to when L is at position 4: like SCAL something.

SCALP, SCALD, SCALY, etc.

With L at position 5: harder. SHALL as I thought, but SHALL has position 4: L, position 5: L? In SHALL, it's S-H-A-L-L, so index: 1:S,2:H,3:A,4:L,5:L. So L at position 4 and 5.

If secret word has SHALL, feedback for slant: slant was S,L,A,N,T → position 4 was N, which got x, so if secret word was SHALL, position 4 is L, not N, so x is correct. Position 2 L in slant got -, meaning L is present but not at 2; in SHALL, L is at 4 and 5, so L is present. But we don't know if L is multiple.

SHALL might be possible.

But SHALL has E? No, SHALL is not SHALE. SHALL is S-H-A-L-L, no E.

SPALL? SPALL means to chip or flake off, S-P-A-L-L, which has position: S(1),P(2),A(3),L(4),L(5). Again repeated L.

But SPALL might not be common; Wordle usually uses common words.

Standard words: SCALP is more common.

SWALY? Not a word.

So perhaps few options with L at position 5, and often with repeated letters.

But we have to consider both cases.

Now, for the guess, I need to make a word that fits known constraints and tests the position of L.

One way is to assume L might be at position 4 and guess a word like SCALP or SCALE, but SCALE has E, excluded.

SCALD: S,C,A,L,D

Or SCAWL? Not a word.

Another word: SHALY? Not common.

Perhaps better to focus on L at position 4 for simplicity.

But I need to decide my guess.

Since L could be at position 4 or 5, I should guess a word that has L in one of those positions to test.

For example, if I guess SCALP, L is at position 4.

If the secret word has L at position 5, this might not be exact, but feedback will tell.

Similarly, if I guess SHALL, L at both 4 and 5, but messy.

List of possible secret words based on current info.

Secret word: S _ A _ _

With _ containing L and another letter? Positions: 2,4,5 need letters.

Known: L is in the word, so one of position 4 or 5 has L, or both? But possibly only one L.

Position 2 is separate.

Letters must be from non-excluded set: excluding R,I,E,N,T.

So available letters: B,C,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,U,V,W,Y,Z, etc.

But common ones.

Possible words:

First, if L at position 4: S _ A L _

Then position 2 and 5: e.g., SCALY: S C A L Y → position 2:C, position 5:Y

SCALP: S C A L P → P at 5

SCALD: S C A L D → D at 5

SHALY? S H A L Y → but SHALY might not be common; SHALY is an adjective, bit obscure.

SHALL: S H A L L → but here position 4:L, position 5:L, so both filled.

SWALY? Not word.

With other letters: S B A L M? Not word.

S F A L K? No.

So limited: S_CAL_ words like SCALP, SCALD, SCALY.

Now, if L at position 5: S _ A _ L

Then position 2 and 4: e.g., SHALL which also has position 4:L, but then it's S _ A L L, so L at both.

Otherwise, S P A I L, but I excluded.

S C A S L? Not.

S K A I L, I excluded.

SABLE: but S A B L E, positions: S(1),A(2),B(3),L(4),E(5) — but we need position 3 to be A, but here position 2 is A, which we know cannot be, from Guess 1 feedback A not at position 2.

Similarly, most words with S _ A _ L will have position 3 not A if position 2 is not vowel or something.

Direct words: STALL, but T excluded.

S M A L L: S M A L L → position 2:M, position 3:A, position 4:L, position 5:L. But L at 4 and 5.

SHALL: S H A L L

SWALL? Not, but SWOLL? Not common.

So possible secret words could be SCALP, SCALD, SHALL, SMALL, etc.

But SMALL has M.

For the guess, I need to choose a new word that incorporates what I know.

My new guess should have:
- Position 1: S (must)
- Position 3: A (must)
- Include L, but not at position 2 (since we know it's wrong there, and not at 1 or 3 for obvious reasons), so L at 4 or 5.
- Cover new letters.

Also, avoid using excluded letters: R,I,E,N,T.

So, a good guess might be SCALP: which has S, C, A, L, P.
- Position: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), P(5)
- This tests C and P, and places L at position 4.

If the secret word has L at position 4, this might confirm.
If not, for example if L is at position 5, then SCALP might give feedback telling us.

Similarly, I could guess SHALL: S,H,A,L,L, but repeated L might be less informative.

Another possibility: using L at position 5, like ""S K A L K"" not word.

I think SCALP is a reasonable choice.

But there's another word: ""SALAD"" — but position: S,A,L,A,D. Position 1:S, position 2:A, but A at position 2 is invalid because we know from Guess 1 that A is not at position 2. So cannot use SALAD.

Similarly, ""SCAMP"": S,C,A,M,P — S(1),C(2),A(3),M(4),P(5). This has no L? But L is in the word, so my guess must include L to confirm or test, but actually, I can choose any word, but to be consistent, if I omit L, I might not learn about its position.

Better to include L in the guess to get feedback on its position.

In SCALP, L is included at position 4.

SCAMP does not have L, so feedback wouldn't tell me about L's position.

Since I know L is present, I should keep it in the guess to find where it is.

So SCALP includes L.

SHALL includes L.

But SHALL has repeated L.

SCALD: S,C,A,L,D

Or SCALY: S,C,A,L,Y

All fine.

I'll go with SCALP as it's common and tests new letters C and P.

Position 2 is C, which I haven't tested before.

Similarly, position 5 P.

Feedback will tell if C or P are in the word.

Now, make the guess.### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Review feedback from previous guesses**:
   - **Guess 1: ""raise"" → Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)**  
     - R, I, E are not in the secret word.
     - A and S are present but in wrong positions: A ≠ position 2, S ≠ position 4.
   - **Guess 2: ""slant"" → Feedback: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)**  
     - S is correct in position 1 (fixed).
     - A is correct in position 3 (fixed).
     - L is present but not in position 2.
     - N and T are not in the word.
   - Summary:
     - Known correct positions: S at position 1, A at position 3.
     - Known present letters: L must be in the word, but not in position 2 (from ""slant"" feedback), so L is in position 4 or 5.
     - Absent letters: R, I, E, N, T (excluded from consideration).
     - Secret word structure: S _ A _ _, where positions 2, 4, 5 need letters, with L in position 4 or 5.

2. **Constraints for the new guess**:
   - Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
   - Position 1 must be S (confirmed).
   - Position 3 must be A (confirmed).
   - Must include L (since it's present), but L cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3 (position 1 and 3 are fixed, position 2 is wrong per feedback), so L should be placed in position 4 or 5 to test its location.
   - Cannot use R, I, E, N, T (excluded letters).
   - Should focus on common remaining letters to maximize information: e.g., C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

3. **Generate possible words**:
   - Since S and A are fixed, and L must be included, brainstorm words starting with S, with A in position 3, and containing L not in positions 1-3:
     - If L is in position 4: Words like SCALP (S, C, A, L, P), SCALD (S, C, A, L, D), or SCALY (S, C, A, L, Y).
     - If L is in position 5: Words like SHALL (S, H, A, L, L) or SMALL (S, M, A, L, L), but these have repeated L, which might be less informative.
     - Words must avoid excluded letters (R, I, E, N, T) and position 2 cannot be A (from Guess 1 feedback).

4. **Select the best guess**:
   - ""SCALP"" is a strong choice because:
     - It fits the structure: S (position 1), C (position 2, new letter to test), A (position 3), L (position 4, tests if L is here), P (position 5, new letter).
     - It uses distinct letters (no repeats), which tests more possibilities efficiently: C and P are new common letters to check.
     - Feedback from ""SCALP"" will clarify:
       - Whether C is in the word and correctly placed (if ✓, C is correct at position 2; if -, C is present but wrong position; if x, C absent).
       - Whether L is correctly placed at position 4 (if ✓, L is fixed at position 4; if -, L is present but position 4 is wrong, confirming L must be at position 5).
       - Whether P is in the word.
     - Alternative words like SCALD (ends with D) or SCALY (ends with Y) are less common or might cover fewer common letters.
   - Avoid words with repeated letters like SHALL (S, H, A, L, L) or SMALL (S, M, A, L, L), as they provide less information about other letters due to duplication.

5. **Decision**:
   - Guess ""SCALP"" to efficiently test position 4 for L, introduce new letters (C and P), and confirm/refine the word structure based on feedback.",Guess 3: scalp -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(✓) L(✓) P(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, the user wants me to make the first guess in a Wordle-like game. Since it's the first attempt, I don't have any feedback to work with yet. I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain – ideally covering common letters and a mix of vowels/consonants. 

English vowels are A, E, I, O, U (sometimes Y). Among these, E and A are statistically the most common. For consonants, R, S, T, L, N are frequent. I recall ""ROATE"" is a popular starter among word game enthusiasts because it packs three vowels (O, A, E) and two common consonants (R, T). Hmm, but ""RAISE"" has the same advantages with S instead of T – and S is also very common. Which is better? Let me compare:

ROATE: R, O, A, T, E → Vowels: O, A, E (3), Consonants: R, T (2).  
RAISE: R, A, I, S, E → Vowels: A, I, E (3), Consonants: R, S (2).

Both cover 3 vowels and 2 high-frequency consonants. However, S appears more often than T in English words. Also, if the secret word has plural forms, S might be extra useful. Plus, I gets used more than O. So RAISE seems slightly superior for coverage.

Wait – is RAISE valid? Absolutely, it's a noun meaning to lift up. No exotic letters either, so it should be accepted. Confirming: R-A-I-S-E. Yep!

The goal here is to cast a wide net. RAISE tests R (most common consonant), three top vowels (A, I, E), and S (another top consonant). Whatever feedback comes back – whether greens, yellows, or grays – will immediately narrow down possibilities significantly. For instance:

- If S is correct/green, possibilities shrink dramatically.  
- If E is yellow, I know it's present but misplaced.  
- Even all grays would reveal those five are absent, which is valuable early on.

No point overthinking for a first guess. RAISE is methodically optimal. Let's go with that.For my first guess, I need a word that maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback. I'll choose a word with common letters (vowels and frequent consonants) to cover broad possibilities. A good starting word often includes letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, A, and O. After considering options like ""ROATE"" or ""CRANE"", I select ""RAISE"" – it uses three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), all frequently appearing in English words. This should provide solid initial clues regardless of the secret word.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
I: x (not in the word)
S: - (in the word but wrong position)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and S, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"" (position 2 for A and position 4 for S).
- The letters R, I, and E are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain R, I, E.
- Contains A and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

We also know that A and S are in the word, so we can try to place them in other positions.

Possible positions for A: since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, S was in position 4 and that was wrong, so it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We also need to avoid R, I, E.

Let's think of words that have A and S, and avoid R, I, E.

Common letters we can use: we have A and S already. We can try to use other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are O, U (and sometimes Y). Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that has A and S, and three new letters that are not R, I, E.

We also want to test new positions for A and S.

For example, we can try putting A in position 1 and S in position 3? Or A in position 3 and S in position 1? We have to see what words exist.

Let me think of words that have A and S, and no R, I, E.

Some possibilities:
- A at the start: A _ _ S _ -> but we need to avoid E at the end? Words like ""aunts"" but that has U, N, T, S. But we have to avoid E? ""aunts"" doesn't have E, R, I? Let's check: A, U, N, T, S -> no R, I, E. But we have S at the end? In our feedback, S was in position 4 and was wrong, but now we are putting S at position 5? That's allowed because it's a different position.

But note: we have two letters we know: A and S. We also have three more letters to choose.

We can also consider words with A and S in other positions.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word (but not at position 2) and S is in the word (but not at position 4), we can try to put A in position 1 and S in position 5? Or A in position 3 and S in position 1? etc.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: A in position 1, S in position 5: words like ""atoms"" (but has O, M, T) -> but we don't know if O, M, T are allowed? They are not forbidden yet. However, ""atoms"" has O and M, which are new.

But we also have to avoid R, I, E. ""atoms"" doesn't have R, I, E? A, T, O, M, S -> no R, I, E. So it's okay.

Option 2: A in position 1, S in position 3: words like ""tasks"" (but that has two S's? and T, K) -> but we don't know if K is allowed. Also, ""tasks"" has two S's? T, A, S, K, S? Actually, ""tasks"" is T-A-S-K-S? That's 5 letters: T (1), A (2), S (3), K (4), S (5). But we have S at position 3 and 5? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. But in our case, we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or twice. However, in the feedback for ""raise"", we only had one S and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If the word had two S's, then we would have gotten two '-' for S? But we only had one S in ""raise"", so we only got one feedback for S. So it's possible that the word has two S's? But we don't know.

But in ""tasks"", we have A at position 2? But we are trying to put A in position 1? So that doesn't work.

We want A in position 1: so first letter A.

Words starting with A, containing S, and no R, I, E.

Examples:
- ALOES -> but has E? E is forbidden. So no.
- ATOLL -> no S? doesn't have S.
- ATOMS: A (1), T (2), O (3), M (4), S (5) -> no R, I, E. And S is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed). A is at position 1 (not 2, so allowed). This seems good.

Another: AULOS -> but U, L, O, S? A (1), U (2), L (3), O (4), S (5). No R, I, E. Also valid? Aulos is a musical instrument, but might be obscure.

Another: AUNTS: A (1), U (2), N (3), T (4), S (5). Common word.

We can also try S at the start? But we don't know if S can be at the start? It wasn't in position 4, but we can try position 1.

For example, S in position 1 and A in position 3: words like ""stain"" but has I? I is forbidden. ""stare"" has E? forbidden. ""scalp"" has C, A, L, P -> S (1), C (2), A (3), L (4), P (5). A is at position 3 (not 2, allowed) and S at position 1 (not 4, allowed). And no R, I, E. So ""scalp"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""shalt"" has H, A, L, T -> S (1), H (2), A (3), L (4), T (5). No R, I, E.

But we have to choose one.

We also want to cover new letters to get more information.

In the first guess, we used: R, A, I, S, E -> we know R, I, E are absent, and A and S are present.

So for the second guess, we want to test A and S in new positions, and also test new letters.

We have 5 positions. We can try to put A and S in positions that we haven't tried and that are allowed.

In the first guess, A was in position 2 (wrong) and S in position 4 (wrong). So we can try A in 1,3,5 and S in 1,2,3,5.

But we also want to avoid positions that are already known to be wrong for these letters? Actually, we don't know about other positions. We only know that position 2 is wrong for A and position 4 is wrong for S.

We can try to cover as many new positions as possible for A and S.

Also, we want to include common letters that we haven't tested: like T, N, O, L, etc.

Let me list some candidate words:

1. ATOMS: A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4), S(5) -> tests A at 1 (new), S at 5 (new). Also tests T, O, M which are new.

2. AUNTS: A(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> tests A at 1, S at 5. New letters: U, N, T.

3. SCALP: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), P(5) -> tests S at 1 (new), A at 3 (new). New letters: C, L, P.

4. SHALT: S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), T(5) -> similar to above, but with H and T.

5. PASTA: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5) -> but A is at position 2? We know that position 2 is wrong for A? So we cannot put A at position 2 again? Because we already know it's not there. So that would be a waste. Also, we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, putting A at position 2 again is not useful because we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 2 for A and position 4 for S.

Therefore, in PASTA, A is at position 2 and 5. Position 2 is forbidden for A, so we shouldn't do that. Also, S is at position 3? That's okay, but A at position 2 is invalid.

So we avoid words that put A at position 2 or S at position 4.

Now, among the candidates, which one gives the most information?

We want to test letters that are common and we haven't tried. We haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, M, P, H, etc.

ATOMS: tests T, O, M
AUNTS: tests U, N, T
SCALP: tests C, L, P
SHALT: tests H, L, T

T is a very common letter, so it might be good to include T.

Similarly, N and L are common.

We can also consider words that put A and S in positions that are more central to get more information about the middle.

But let's choose a word that uses common letters and avoids obscure ones.

Another candidate: ""TASKS"" -> but T(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5). But A is at position 2? We know A is not at position 2, so that's invalid.

""PASTY"" -> P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). Again, A at position 2: invalid.

""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This seems good: S at 1 (not 4), A at 3 (not 2). New letters: L, N, T. And no R, I, E.

Similarly, ""PLANS"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), S(5). But S is at position 5? That's okay. But we have A at 3 and S at 5.

""SLANT"" is a good candidate: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). It tests S at position 1, A at position 3, and new letters L, N, T.

We also avoid position 2 for A and position 4 for S? In this word, S is at 1 (not 4) and A is at 3 (not 2). Also, position 4 is N, which is new.

But note: in the feedback, we know that position 4 was S in the first guess and it was wrong, but that doesn't mean that position 4 cannot be another letter. We are free to put any letter at position 4.

So ""SLANT"" is valid.

Similarly, ""SALTS"": S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), S(5). But A is at position 2? That's not allowed because we know A is not at position 2. So invalid.

""OASIS"": O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5). But A at position 2? Invalid. Also, I is forbidden.

So back to ""SLANT"" and ""ATOMS"".

I think ""SLANT"" is a good choice because it tests S at the start and A in the middle, and common letters L, N, T.

Another option: ""SONAR"" but has R? R is forbidden.

""SAUCE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), C(4), E(5). But A at position 2? Invalid and E is forbidden.

So let's go with ""SLANT"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""SLANT"" is a valid English word.

We can also consider ""Casts"" but that has C, A, S, T, S -> but if we spell it as ""CASTS"", then C(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So I think ""SLANT"" is a solid choice.

Alternatively, ""PASTY"" is invalid because of A at 2.

Another word: ""MASON"" -> M(1), A(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). But A at position 2? Invalid.

""BASSO"" -> B(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So we avoid position 2 for A.

What about ""LASSO""? L(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5). Again, A at position 2? Invalid.

So we need a word without A at position 2 and without S at position 4.

""SLANT"" fits: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). S is at 1, A at 3, and position 4 is N (which is new).

We can also do ""SALON"": S(1), A(2), L(3), O(4), N(5). But A at position 2? Invalid.

""TALON"": T(1), A(2), L(3), O(4), N(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So ""SLANT"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""STANK"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), K(5). This is valid: S at 1, A at 3, and new letters T, N, K. But K is less common.

""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This is also valid: A at 3, and S is not in this word? But we know S must be in the word! So we cannot choose a word without S. We must include S.

Ah, important: we must include both A and S in the word because they are present.

So ""PLANT"" has A but not S? So that's invalid because we know S is in the word.

Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has A and S? A at 1, S at 5: yes.

""SLANT"" has S at 1 and A at 3: yes.

""STANK"" has S at 1 and A at 3: yes.

But ""STANK"" has K, which is less common. So ""SLANT"" or ""ATOMS"" might be better.

Between ""SLANT"" and ""ATOMS"", which one?

""SLANT"": letters S, L, A, N, T -> all common.
""ATOMS"": A, T, O, M, S -> also common.

We might want to avoid less common letters. Both are fine.

But note: in ""SLANT"", we are testing L, N, T. In ""ATOMS"", we are testing T, O, M.

We haven't tested any of these, so both are good.

I think ""SLANT"" is a good choice because it tests S at position 1 and A at position 3, which are positions we haven't tried for these letters.

We can also consider ""SALTY"", but S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So I'll go with ""SLANT"".

But let's confirm: the word must be 5 letters, English, and not use R, I, E.

""SLANT"": S, L, A, N, T -> no R, I, E. And A is at position 3 (not 2), S at position 1 (not 4). Good.

We could also do ""SNAPS"": S(1), N(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). This has A at 3 (good), S at 1 and 5? But we don't know if S appears twice. However, we are testing S at two positions: 1 and 5. But we already know S is in the word, so if we get a '-' for S at position 1 and/or 5, that tells us about the position. But if we get a 'x' for one of them, it might be confusing? Actually, if we get a 'x' for S at position 1, that means S is not at position 1, but we know S is in the word so it must be elsewhere. Similarly for position 5. But we are using two S's, which might be inefficient if the word has only one S.

But it's acceptable. However, ""SNAPS"" has P and S at position 4? Position 4: we know that in the first guess, position 4 was S and it was wrong, but that doesn't prevent us from putting another letter at position 4. In fact, we are putting P at position 4? The word is S(1), N(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). So position 4 is P, which is new.

But we are using two S's. Since we have limited guesses, it might be better to use five distinct letters to test more letters. But ""SLANT"" has distinct letters: S, L, A, N, T. Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has A, T, O, M, S -> distinct.

""SNAPS"" has two S's, so we are testing only four distinct letters: S, N, A, P.

So for information gain, distinct letters are better.

Therefore, ""SLANT"" or ""ATOMS"" are better.

I think I'll go with ""SLANT"".

So the next guess: SLANT.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, I, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A and S **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A cannot be in position 2, and S cannot be in position 4.

For the second guess:
- The word must include A and S, but avoid positions 2 for A and 4 for S.
- It must exclude R, I, and E entirely.
- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (like T, N, L) and place A and S in new positions not yet ruled out.

The word ""slant"" fits these criteria:
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so allowed).
- A is in position 3 (not 2, so allowed).
- It includes new common letters: L, N, T.
- It avoids R, I, E.
- All letters are distinct, which helps test more possibilities efficiently.

This guess will provide feedback on S at position 1, A at position 3, and the new letters L, N, T, helping narrow down the secret word.

<guess>slant</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to review the feedback from both guesses to understand what I know about the secret word.

From Guess 1 (raise):
- R: x → R is not in the word.
- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I: x → I is not in the word.
- S: - → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E: x → E is not in the word.

So, after Guess 1, I know:
- The secret word contains A and S, but A is not in position 2, and S is not in position 4.
- R, I, E are absent.

From Guess 2 (slant):
- S: ✓ → S is in the word and in the correct position, position 1.
- L: - → L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A: ✓ → A is in the word and in the correct position, position 3.
- N: x → N is not in the word.
- T: x → T is not in the word.

So, combining this with Guess 1 feedback:
- S is in position 1 (confirmed by ✓ in slant).
- A is in position 3 (confirmed by ✓ in slant).
- L is present but not in position 2 (since it got ""-"" in slant).
- N and T are absent (both x).
- Also, R, I, E are absent from before.

Now, I know the secret word has:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- L is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2. Since positions 1 and 3 are taken, L must be in position 2, 4, or 5, but position 2 is not possible because the feedback from slant says L is not in position 2 (given ""-""). So L is in position 4 or 5.

Feedback shows L: -, which means L is present but wrong position. In slant, L was in position 2, so position 2 is incorrect for L. Therefore, L could be in position 4 or 5 (since position 1 and 3 are occupied).

Also, we have three positions to determine: positions 2, 4, and 5.
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: ? (but not L, and not any absent letters)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: ? 
- Position 5: ?

The word must contain L, and L is not in position 2. So L is in position 4 or 5.

Additionally, from absent letters: R, I, E, N, T are all not in the word.

Letters not used yet that could be in: I, E, R are out, N and T are out from Guess 2.

Letters excluded so far: from Guess 1: R, I, E; from Guess 2: N, T. So excluded: R,I,E,N,T.

Common letters that might still be possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

But since L is present, and S and A are fixed, the word has S, A, L, and two other letters.

The secret word is 5 letters: position 1: S, position 3: A, and L somewhere, plus two more characters.

Since L must be placed, and it's not position 2, it's in 4 or 5.

Let me denote the possibilities.

Assume L is in position 4. Then positions would be:
1: S
2: ?
3: A
4: L
5: ?

Or L in position 5:
1: S
2: ?
3: A
4: ?
5: L

Now, position 2 needs a letter that is not excluded. Excluded letters: R,I,E,N,T.

Also, since L got ""-"" in position 2, but position 2 is empty now, so whatever goes there should not be L, which we know.

Now, I need to guess a new word that fits what I know and tests possibilities.

My new guess must:
- Have S in position 1 (since it's confirmed).
- Have A in position 3 (confirmed).
- Include L (since it's in the word), but not in position 2 (and not in position 1 or 3 for that matter), so L should be in position 4 or 5.
- Exclude R,I,E,N,T.
- Position 2 should be a new letter to test.

Moreover, I should avoid using letters that are excluded.

Possible words:

First, let's list English words that start with S, have A in position 3, and contain L.

Position 1: S, position 3: A, and L present.

Examples:

- If L is in position 4: S _ A L _

Words like: SCALP, SCALD, etc., but need to check letters.

SCALP: S, C, A, L, P → positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:A, 4:L, 5:P

But letters: C and P are new, not excluded.

SCALD: S, C, A, L, D → similar, with D.

- If L is in position 5: S _ A _ L

Words like: SHALE, but H and E; E is excluded, so not allowed. SHALE has E.

STALE: has T, but T is excluded.

SPALE? Not a word.

SABLE: S, A, B, L, E → but position 3 is B? No: S (1), A (2?), but in our case position 3 must be A, so S _ A _ L. So word must have second letter anything, position 3 A, position 5 L.

Sable is S-A-B-L-E? S (1), A (2), B (3), L (4), E (5) — but we need position 3 to be A, not position 2. Position 2 here is A, but we know position 2 cannot be A? No, from Guess 1, A cannot be in position 2, but position 2 could be something else.

In secret word, position 2 is unknown, but A is at position 3, so position 2 is not A.

For words with S at 1, position 3 A, and L at 5: S _ A _ L

Examples: SHALL, but SHALL has two L's? S,H,A,L,L? Position 5 is L, but it has L at position 4 too? SHALL is S-H-A-L-L, so positions correspond as needed: S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), L(5). Position 4 and 5 both L? But in this case, L at position 4 or 5.

But SHALL has a repeated L, and position 4 is L.

Another word: SNAIL, but N and I are excluded. N is excluded from Guess 2.

SKYAL? Not a word.

SWAYL? Not a word.

Possible words: SMAWL? Not common.

Perhaps not many with L at position 5.

Other options: SCALY, but SCALY has Y, and position: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), Y(5) — so L at position 4.

SCALY is a word.

So back to when L is at position 4: like SCAL something.

SCALP, SCALD, SCALY, etc.

With L at position 5: harder. SHALL as I thought, but SHALL has position 4: L, position 5: L? In SHALL, it's S-H-A-L-L, so index: 1:S,2:H,3:A,4:L,5:L. So L at position 4 and 5.

If secret word has SHALL, feedback for slant: slant was S,L,A,N,T → position 4 was N, which got x, so if secret word was SHALL, position 4 is L, not N, so x is correct. Position 2 L in slant got -, meaning L is present but not at 2; in SHALL, L is at 4 and 5, so L is present. But we don't know if L is multiple.

SHALL might be possible.

But SHALL has E? No, SHALL is not SHALE. SHALL is S-H-A-L-L, no E.

SPALL? SPALL means to chip or flake off, S-P-A-L-L, which has position: S(1),P(2),A(3),L(4),L(5). Again repeated L.

But SPALL might not be common; Wordle usually uses common words.

Standard words: SCALP is more common.

SWALY? Not a word.

So perhaps few options with L at position 5, and often with repeated letters.

But we have to consider both cases.

Now, for the guess, I need to make a word that fits known constraints and tests the position of L.

One way is to assume L might be at position 4 and guess a word like SCALP or SCALE, but SCALE has E, excluded.

SCALD: S,C,A,L,D

Or SCAWL? Not a word.

Another word: SHALY? Not common.

Perhaps better to focus on L at position 4 for simplicity.

But I need to decide my guess.

Since L could be at position 4 or 5, I should guess a word that has L in one of those positions to test.

For example, if I guess SCALP, L is at position 4.

If the secret word has L at position 5, this might not be exact, but feedback will tell.

Similarly, if I guess SHALL, L at both 4 and 5, but messy.

List of possible secret words based on current info.

Secret word: S _ A _ _

With _ containing L and another letter? Positions: 2,4,5 need letters.

Known: L is in the word, so one of position 4 or 5 has L, or both? But possibly only one L.

Position 2 is separate.

Letters must be from non-excluded set: excluding R,I,E,N,T.

So available letters: B,C,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,U,V,W,Y,Z, etc.

But common ones.

Possible words:

First, if L at position 4: S _ A L _

Then position 2 and 5: e.g., SCALY: S C A L Y → position 2:C, position 5:Y

SCALP: S C A L P → P at 5

SCALD: S C A L D → D at 5

SHALY? S H A L Y → but SHALY might not be common; SHALY is an adjective, bit obscure.

SHALL: S H A L L → but here position 4:L, position 5:L, so both filled.

SWALY? Not word.

With other letters: S B A L M? Not word.

S F A L K? No.

So limited: S_CAL_ words like SCALP, SCALD, SCALY.

Now, if L at position 5: S _ A _ L

Then position 2 and 4: e.g., SHALL which also has position 4:L, but then it's S _ A L L, so L at both.

Otherwise, S P A I L, but I excluded.

S C A S L? Not.

S K A I L, I excluded.

SABLE: but S A B L E, positions: S(1),A(2),B(3),L(4),E(5) — but we need position 3 to be A, but here position 2 is A, which we know cannot be, from Guess 1 feedback A not at position 2.

Similarly, most words with S _ A _ L will have position 3 not A if position 2 is not vowel or something.

Direct words: STALL, but T excluded.

S M A L L: S M A L L → position 2:M, position 3:A, position 4:L, position 5:L. But L at 4 and 5.

SHALL: S H A L L

SWALL? Not, but SWOLL? Not common.

So possible secret words could be SCALP, SCALD, SHALL, SMALL, etc.

But SMALL has M.

For the guess, I need to choose a new word that incorporates what I know.

My new guess should have:
- Position 1: S (must)
- Position 3: A (must)
- Include L, but not at position 2 (since we know it's wrong there, and not at 1 or 3 for obvious reasons), so L at 4 or 5.
- Cover new letters.

Also, avoid using excluded letters: R,I,E,N,T.

So, a good guess might be SCALP: which has S, C, A, L, P.
- Position: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), P(5)
- This tests C and P, and places L at position 4.

If the secret word has L at position 4, this might confirm.
If not, for example if L is at position 5, then SCALP might give feedback telling us.

Similarly, I could guess SHALL: S,H,A,L,L, but repeated L might be less informative.

Another possibility: using L at position 5, like ""S K A L K"" not word.

I think SCALP is a reasonable choice.

But there's another word: ""SALAD"" — but position: S,A,L,A,D. Position 1:S, position 2:A, but A at position 2 is invalid because we know from Guess 1 that A is not at position 2. So cannot use SALAD.

Similarly, ""SCAMP"": S,C,A,M,P — S(1),C(2),A(3),M(4),P(5). This has no L? But L is in the word, so my guess must include L to confirm or test, but actually, I can choose any word, but to be consistent, if I omit L, I might not learn about its position.

Better to include L in the guess to get feedback on its position.

In SCALP, L is included at position 4.

SCAMP does not have L, so feedback wouldn't tell me about L's position.

Since I know L is present, I should keep it in the guess to find where it is.

So SCALP includes L.

SHALL includes L.

But SHALL has repeated L.

SCALD: S,C,A,L,D

Or SCALY: S,C,A,L,Y

All fine.

I'll go with SCALP as it's common and tests new letters C and P.

Position 2 is C, which I haven't tested before.

Similarly, position 5 P.

Feedback will tell if C or P are in the word.

Now, make the guess.### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Review feedback from previous guesses**:
   - **Guess 1: ""raise"" → Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)**  
     - R, I, E are not in the secret word.
     - A and S are present but in wrong positions: A ≠ position 2, S ≠ position 4.
   - **Guess 2: ""slant"" → Feedback: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)**  
     - S is correct in position 1 (fixed).
     - A is correct in position 3 (fixed).
     - L is present but not in position 2.
     - N and T are not in the word.
   - Summary:
     - Known correct positions: S at position 1, A at position 3.
     - Known present letters: L must be in the word, but not in position 2 (from ""slant"" feedback), so L is in position 4 or 5.
     - Absent letters: R, I, E, N, T (excluded from consideration).
     - Secret word structure: S _ A _ _, where positions 2, 4, 5 need letters, with L in position 4 or 5.

2. **Constraints for the new guess**:
   - Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
   - Position 1 must be S (confirmed).
   - Position 3 must be A (confirmed).
   - Must include L (since it's present), but L cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3 (position 1 and 3 are fixed, position 2 is wrong per feedback), so L should be placed in position 4 or 5 to test its location.
   - Cannot use R, I, E, N, T (excluded letters).
   - Should focus on common remaining letters to maximize information: e.g., C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

3. **Generate possible words**:
   - Since S and A are fixed, and L must be included, brainstorm words starting with S, with A in position 3, and containing L not in positions 1-3:
     - If L is in position 4: Words like SCALP (S, C, A, L, P), SCALD (S, C, A, L, D), or SCALY (S, C, A, L, Y).
     - If L is in position 5: Words like SHALL (S, H, A, L, L) or SMALL (S, M, A, L, L), but these have repeated L, which might be less informative.
     - Words must avoid excluded letters (R, I, E, N, T) and position 2 cannot be A (from Guess 1 feedback).

4. **Select the best guess**:
   - ""SCALP"" is a strong choice because:
     - It fits the structure: S (position 1), C (position 2, new letter to test), A (position 3), L (position 4, tests if L is here), P (position 5, new letter).
     - It uses distinct letters (no repeats), which tests more possibilities efficiently: C and P are new common letters to check.
     - Feedback from ""SCALP"" will clarify:
       - Whether C is in the word and correctly placed (if ✓, C is correct at position 2; if -, C is present but wrong position; if x, C absent).
       - Whether L is correctly placed at position 4 (if ✓, L is fixed at position 4; if -, L is present but position 4 is wrong, confirming L must be at position 5).
       - Whether P is in the word.
     - Alternative words like SCALD (ends with D) or SCALY (ends with Y) are less common or might cover fewer common letters.
   - Avoid words with repeated letters like SHALL (S, H, A, L, L) or SMALL (S, M, A, L, L), as they provide less information about other letters due to duplication.

5. **Decision**:
   - Guess ""SCALP"" to efficiently test position 4 for L, introduce new letters (C and P), and confirm/refine the word structure based on feedback.

Since it\'s the first attempt, I don\'t have any feedback to work with yet. I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain – ideally covering common letters and a mix of vowels/consonants. \n\nEnglish vowels are A, E, I, O, U (sometimes Y). Among these, E and A are statistically the most common. For consonants, R, S, T, L, N are frequent. I recall ""ROATE"" is a popular starter among word game enthusiasts because it packs three vowels (O, A, E) and two common consonants (R, T). Hmm, but ""RAISE"" has the same advantages with S instead of T – and S is also very common. Which is better? Let me compare:\n\nROATE: R, O, A, T, E → Vowels: O, A, E (3), Consonants: R, T (2).  \nRAISE: R, A, I, S, E → Vowels: A, I, E (3), Consonants: R, S (2).\n\nBoth cover 3 vowels and 2 high-frequency consonants. However, S appears more often than T in English words. Also, if the secret word has plural forms, S might be extra useful. Plus, I gets used more than O. So RAISE seems slightly superior for coverage.\n\nWait – is RAISE valid? Absolutely, it\'s a noun meaning to lift up. No exotic letters either, so it should be accepted. Confirming: R-A-I-S-E. Yep!\n\nThe goal here is to cast a wide net. RAISE tests R (most common consonant), three top vowels (A, I, E), and S (another top consonant). Whatever feedback comes back – whether greens, yellows, or grays – will immediately narrow down possibilities significantly. For instance:\n\n- If S is correct/green, possibilities shrink dramatically.  \n- If E is yellow, I know it\'s present but misplaced.  \n- Even all grays would reveal those five are absent, which is valuable early on.\n\nNo point overthinking for a first guess. RAISE is methodically optimal. Let\'s go with that.For my first guess, I need a word that maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback. I\'ll choose a word with common letters (vowels and frequent consonants) to cover broad possibilities. A good starting word often includes letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, A, and O. After considering options like ""ROATE"" or ""CRANE"", I select ""RAISE"" – it uses three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), all frequently appearing in English words.

Or A in position 3 and S in position 1? We have to see what words exist.\n\nLet me think of words that have A and S, and no R, I, E.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- A at the start: A _ _ S _ -> but we need to avoid E at the end? Words like ""aunts"" but that has U, N, T, S. But we have to avoid E? ""aunts"" doesn\'t have E, R, I? Let\'s check: A, U, N, T, S -> no R, I, E. But we have S at the end? In our feedback, S was in position 4 and was wrong, but now we are putting S at position 5? That\'s allowed because it\'s a different position.\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know: A and S. We also have three more letters to choose.\n\nWe can also consider words with A and S in other positions.\n\nAnother idea: since we know A is in the word (but not at position 2) and S is in the word (but not at position 4), we can try to put A in position 1 and S in position 5? Or A in position 3 and S in position 1? etc.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\nOption 1: A in position 1, S in position 5: words like ""atoms"" (but has O, M, T) -> but we don\'t know if O, M, T are allowed? They are not forbidden yet. However, ""atoms"" has O and M, which are new.\n\nBut we also have to avoid R, I, E. ""atoms"" doesn\'t have R, I, E? A, T, O, M, S -> no R, I, E. So it\'s okay.\n\nOption 2: A in position 1, S in position 3: words like ""tasks"" (but that has two S\'s? and T, K) -> but we don\'t know if K is allowed. Also, ""tasks"" has two S\'s? T, A, S, K, S? Actually, ""tasks"" is T-A-S-K-S? That\'s 5 letters: T (1), A (2), S (3), K (4), S (5). But we have S at position 3 and 5? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. But in our case, we know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears once or twice. However, in the feedback for ""raise"", we only had one S and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If the word had two S\'s, then we would have gotten two \'-\' for S? But we only had one S in ""raise"", so we only got one feedback for S. So it\'s possible that the word has two S\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""tasks"", we have A at position 2? But we are trying to put A in position 1? So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe want A in position 1: so first letter A.\n\nWords starting with A, containing S, and no R, I, E.\n\nExamples:\n- ALOES -> but has E? E is forbidden. So no.\n- ATOLL -> no S? doesn\'t have S.\n- ATOMS: A (1), T (2), O (3), M (4), S (5) -> no R, I, E. And S is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed). A is at position 1 (not 2, so allowed). This seems good.\n\nAnother: AULOS -> but U, L, O, S? A (1), U (2), L (3), O (4), S (5). No R, I, E. Also valid? Aulos is a musical instrument, but might be obscure.\n\nAnother: AUNTS: A (1), U (2), N (3), T (4), S (5). Common word.\n\nWe can also try S at the start? But we don\'t know if S can be at the start? It wasn\'t in position 4, but we can try position 1.\n\nFor example, S in position 1 and A in position 3: words like ""stain"" but has I? I is forbidden. ""stare"" has E? forbidden. ""scalp"" has C, A, L, P -> S (1), C (2), A (3), L (4), P (5). A is at position 3 (not 2, allowed) and S at position 1 (not 4, allowed). And no R, I, E. So ""scalp"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""shalt"" has H, A, L, T -> S (1), H (2), A (3), L (4), T (5). No R, I, E.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe also want to cover new letters to get more information.\n\nIn the first guess, we used: R, A, I, S, E -> we know R, I, E are absent, and A and S are present.\n\nSo for the second guess, we want to test A and S in new positions, and also test new letters.\n\nWe have 5 positions. We can try to put A and S in positions that we haven\'t tried and that are allowed.\n\nIn the first guess, A was in position 2 (wrong) and S in position 4 (wrong). So we can try A in 1,3,5 and S in 1,2,3,5.\n\nBut we also want to avoid positions that are already known to be wrong for these letters? Actually, we don\'t know about other positions. We only know that position 2 is wrong for A and position 4 is wrong for S.\n\nWe can try to cover as many new positions as possible for A and S.\n\nAlso, we want to include common letters that we haven\'t tested: like T, N, O, L, etc.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\n1. ATOMS: A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4), S(5) -> tests A at 1 (new), S at 5 (new). Also tests T, O, M which are new.\n\n2. AUNTS: A(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> tests A at 1, S at 5. New letters: U, N, T.\n\n3. SCALP: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), P(5) -> tests S at 1 (new), A at 3 (new). New letters: C, L, P.\n\n4. SHALT: S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), T(5) -> similar to above, but with H and T.\n\n5. PASTA: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5) -> but A is at position 2? We know that position 2 is wrong for A? So we cannot put A at position 2 again? Because we already know it\'s not there. So that would be a waste. Also, we have two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. However, putting A at position 2 again is not useful because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid position 2 for A and position 4 for S.\n\nTherefore, in PASTA, A is at position 2 and 5. Position 2 is forbidden for A, so we shouldn\'t do that. Also, S is at position 3? That\'s okay, but A at position 2 is invalid.\n\nSo we avoid words that put A at position 2 or S at position 4.\n\nNow, among the candidates, which one gives the most information?\n\nWe want to test letters that are common and we haven\'t tried. We haven\'t tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, M, P, H, etc.\n\nATOMS: tests T, O, M\nAUNTS: tests U, N, T\nSCALP: tests C, L, P\nSHALT: tests H, L, T\n\nT is a very common letter, so it might be good to include T.\n\nSimilarly, N and L are common.\n\nWe can also consider words that put A and S in positions that are more central to get more information about the middle.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word that uses common letters and avoids obscure ones.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TASKS"" -> but T(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5). But A is at position 2? We know A is not at position 2, so that\'s invalid.\n\n""PASTY"" -> P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). Again, A at position 2: invalid.\n\n""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This seems good: S at 1 (not 4), A at 3 (not 2). New letters: L, N, T. And no R, I, E.\n\nSimilarly, ""PLANS"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), S(5). But S is at position 5? That\'s okay. But we have A at 3 and S at 5.\n\n""SLANT"" is a good candidate: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). It tests S at position 1, A at position 3, and new letters L, N, T.\n\nWe also avoid position 2 for A and position 4 for S? In this word, S is at 1 (not 4) and A is at 3 (not 2). Also, position 4 is N, which is new.\n\nBut note: in the feedback, we know that position 4 was S in the first guess and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t mean that position 4 cannot be another letter. We are free to put any letter at position 4.\n\nSo ""SLANT"" is valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""SALTS"": S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), S(5). But A is at position 2? That\'s not allowed because we know A is not at position 2. So invalid.\n\n""OASIS"": O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5). But A at position 2? Invalid. Also, I is forbidden.\n\nSo back to ""SLANT"" and ""ATOMS"".\n\nI think ""SLANT"" is a good choice because it tests S at the start and A in the middle, and common letters L, N, T.\n\nAnother option: ""SONAR"" but has R? R is forbidden.\n\n""SAUCE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), C(4), E(5). But A at position 2? Invalid and E is forbidden.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SLANT"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""SLANT"" is a valid English word.\n\nWe can also consider ""Casts"" but that has C, A, S, T, S -> but if we spell it as ""CASTS"", then C(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5). A at position 2? Invalid.\n\nSo I think ""SLANT"" is a solid choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""PASTY"" is invalid because of A at 2.\n\nAnother word: ""MASON"" -> M(1), A(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). But A at position 2? Invalid.\n\n""BASSO"" -> B(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5). A at position 2? Invalid.\n\nSo we avoid position 2 for A.\n\nWhat about ""LASSO""? L(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5). Again, A at position 2? Invalid.\n\nSo we need a word without A at position 2 and without S at position 4.\n\n""SLANT"" fits: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). S is at 1, A at 3, and position 4 is N (which is new).\n\nWe can also do ""SALON"": S(1), A(2), L(3), O(4), N(5). But A at position 2? Invalid.\n\n""TALON"": T(1), A(2), L(3), O(4), N(5). A at position 2? Invalid.\n\nSo ""SLANT"" seems good.\n\nAnother candidate: ""STANK"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), K(5). This is valid: S at 1, A at 3, and new letters T, N, K. But K is less common.\n\n""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This is also valid: A at 3, and S is not in this word? But we know S must be in the word! So we cannot choose a word without S. We must include S.\n\nAh, important: we must include both A and S in the word because they are present.\n\nSo ""PLANT"" has A but not S? So that\'s invalid because we know S is in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""ATOMS"" has A and S? A at 1, S at 5: yes.\n\n""SLANT"" has S at 1 and A at 3: yes.\n\n""STANK"" has S at 1 and A at 3: yes.\n\nBut ""STANK"" has K, which is less common. So ""SLANT"" or ""ATOMS"" might be better.\n\nBetween ""SLANT"" and ""ATOMS"", which one?\n\n""SLANT"": letters S, L, A, N, T -> all common.\n""ATOMS"": A, T, O, M, S -> also common.\n\nWe might want to avoid less common letters. Both are fine.\n\nBut note: in ""SLANT"", we are testing L, N, T. In ""ATOMS"", we are testing T, O, M.\n\nWe haven\'t tested any of these, so both are good.\n\nI think ""SLANT"" is a good choice because it tests S at position 1 and A at position 3, which are positions we haven\'t tried for these letters.\n\nWe can also consider ""SALTY"", but S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5). A at position 2? Invalid.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SLANT"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: the word must be 5 letters, English, and not use R, I, E.\n\n""SLANT"": S, L, A, N, T -> no R, I, E. And A is at position 3 (not 2), S at position 1 (not 4). Good.\n\nWe could also do ""SNAPS"": S(1), N(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). This has A at 3 (good), S at 1 and 5? But we don\'t know if S appears twice. However, we are testing S at two positions: 1 and 5. But we already know S is in the word, so if we get a \'-\' for S at position 1 and/or 5, that tells us about the position. But if we get a \'x\' for one of them, it might be confusing? Actually, if we get a \'x\' for S at position 1, that means S is not at position 1, but we know S is in the word so it must be elsewhere. Similarly for position 5. But we are using two S\'s, which might be inefficient if the word has only one S.\n\nBut it\'s acceptable. However, ""SNAPS"" has P and S at position 4? Position 4: we know that in the first guess, position 4 was S and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t prevent us from putting another letter at position 4. In fact, we are putting P at position 4? The word is S(1), N(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). So position 4 is P, which is new.\n\nBut we are using two S\'s. Since we have limited guesses, it might be better to use five distinct letters to test more letters. But ""SLANT"" has distinct letters: S, L, A, N, T. Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has A, T, O, M, S -> distinct.\n\n""SNAPS"" has two S\'s, so we are testing only four distinct letters: S, N, A, P.\n\nSo for information gain, distinct letters are better.\n\nTherefore, ""SLANT"" or ""ATOMS"" are better.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""SLANT"".\n\nSo the next guess: SLANT.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R, I, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- A and S **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A cannot be in position 2, and S cannot be in position 4.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include A and S, but avoid positions 2 for A and 4 for S.\n- It must exclude R, I, and E entirely.\n- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (like T, N, L) and place A and S in new positions not yet ruled out.\n\nThe word ""slant"" fits these criteria:\n- S is in position 1 (not 4, so allowed).\n- A is in position 3 (not 2, so allowed).\n- It includes new common letters: L, N, T.\n- It avoids R, I, E.\n- All letters are distinct, which helps test more possibilities efficiently.\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on S at position 1, A at position 3, and the new letters L, N, T, helping narrow down the secret word.\n\n<guess>slant</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'First, I need to review the feedback from both guesses to understand what I know about the secret word.\n\nFrom Guess 1 (raise):\n- R: x → R is not in the word.\n- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 2.\n- I: x → I is not in the word.\n- S: - → S is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E: x → E is not in the word.\n\nSo, after Guess 1, I know:\n- The secret word contains A and S, but A is not in position 2, and S is not in position 4.\n- R, I, E are absent.\n\nFrom Guess 2 (slant):\n- S: ✓ → S is in the word and in the correct position, position 1.\n- L: - → L is in the word but not in position 2.\n- A: ✓ → A is in the word and in the correct position, position 3.\n- N: x → N is not in the word.\n- T: x → T is not in the word.\n\nSo, combining this with Guess 1 feedback:\n- S is in position 1 (confirmed by ✓ in slant).\n- A is in position 3 (confirmed by ✓ in slant).\n- L is present but not in position 2 (since it got ""-"" in slant).\n- N and T are absent (both x).\n- Also, R, I, E are absent from before.\n\nNow, I know the secret word has:\n- Position 1: S (fixed)\n- Position 3: A (fixed)\n- L is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2. Since positions 1 and 3 are taken, L must be in position 2, 4, or 5, but position 2 is not possible because the feedback from slant says L is not in position 2 (given ""-""). So L is in position 4 or 5.\n\nFeedback shows L: -, which means L is present but wrong position. In slant, L was in position 2, so position 2 is incorrect for L. Therefore, L could be in position 4 or 5 (since position 1 and 3 are occupied).\n\nAlso, we have three positions to determine: positions 2, 4, and 5.\n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: ? (but not L, and not any absent letters)\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 4: ? \n- Position 5: ?\n\nThe word must contain L, and L is not in position 2. So L is in position 4 or 5.\n\nAdditionally, from absent letters: R, I, E, N, T are all not in the word.\n\nLetters not used yet that could be in: I, E, R are out, N and T are out from Guess 2.\n\nLetters excluded so far: from Guess 1: R, I, E; from Guess 2: N, T. So excluded: R,I,E,N,T.\n\nCommon letters that might still be possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nBut since L is present, and S and A are fixed, the word has S, A, L, and two other letters.\n\nThe secret word is 5 letters: position 1: S, position 3: A, and L somewhere, plus two more characters.\n\nSince L must be placed, and it\'s not position 2, it\'s in 4 or 5.\n\nLet me denote the possibilities.\n\nAssume L is in position 4. Then positions would be:\n1: S\n2: ?\n3: A\n4: L\n5: ?\n\nOr L in position 5:\n1: S\n2: ?\n3: A\n4: ?\n5: L\n\nNow, position 2 needs a letter that is not excluded. Excluded letters: R,I,E,N,T.\n\nAlso, since L got ""-"" in position 2, but position 2 is empty now, so whatever goes there should not be L, which we know.\n\nNow, I need to guess a new word that fits what I know and tests possibilities.\n\nMy new guess must:\n- Have S in position 1 (since it\'s confirmed).\n- Have A in position 3 (confirmed).\n- Include L (since it\'s in the word), but not in position 2 (and not in position 1 or 3 for that matter), so L should be in position 4 or 5.\n- Exclude R,I,E,N,T.\n- Position 2 should be a new letter to test.\n\nMoreover, I should avoid using letters that are excluded.\n\nPossible words:\n\nFirst, let\'s list English words that start with S, have A in position 3, and contain L.\n\nPosition 1: S, position 3: A, and L present.\n\nExamples:\n\n- If L is in position 4: S _ A L _\n\nWords like: SCALP, SCALD, etc., but need to check letters.\n\nSCALP: S, C, A, L, P → positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:A, 4:L, 5:P\n\nBut letters: C and P are new, not excluded.\n\nSCALD: S, C, A, L, D → similar, with D.\n\n- If L is in position 5: S _ A _ L\n\nWords like: SHALE, but H and E; E is excluded, so not allowed. SHALE has E.\n\nSTALE: has T, but T is excluded.\n\nSPALE? Not a word.\n\nSABLE: S, A, B, L, E → but position 3 is B? No: S (1), A (2?), but in our case position 3 must be A, so S _ A _ L. So word must have second letter anything, position 3 A, position 5 L.\n\nSable is S-A-B-L-E? S (1), A (2), B (3), L (4), E (5) — but we need position 3 to be A, not position 2. Position 2 here is A, but we know position 2 cannot be A? No, from Guess 1, A cannot be in position 2, but position 2 could be something else.\n\nIn secret word, position 2 is unknown, but A is at position 3, so position 2 is not A.\n\nFor words with S at 1, position 3 A, and L at 5: S _ A _ L\n\nExamples: SHALL, but SHALL has two L\'s? S,H,A,L,L? Position 5 is L, but it has L at position 4 too? SHALL is S-H-A-L-L, so positions correspond as needed: S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), L(5). Position 4 and 5 both L? But in this case, L at position 4 or 5.\n\nBut SHALL has a repeated L, and position 4 is L.\n\nAnother word: SNAIL, but N and I are excluded. N is excluded from Guess 2.\n\nSKYAL? Not a word.\n\nSWAYL? Not a word.\n\nPossible words: SMAWL? Not common.\n\nPerhaps not many with L at position 5.\n\nOther options: SCALY, but SCALY has Y, and position: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), Y(5) — so L at position 4.\n\nSCALY is a word.\n\nSo back to when L is at position 4: like SCAL something.\n\nSCALP, SCALD, SCALY, etc.\n\nWith L at position 5: harder. SHALL as I thought, but SHALL has position 4: L, position 5: L? In SHALL, it\'s S-H-A-L-L, so index: 1:S,2:H,3:A,4:L,5:L. So L at position 4 and 5.\n\nIf secret word has SHALL, feedback for slant: slant was S,L,A,N,T → position 4 was N, which got x, so if secret word was SHALL, position 4 is L, not N, so x is correct. Position 2 L in slant got -, meaning L is present but not at 2; in SHALL, L is at 4 and 5, so L is present. But we don\'t know if L is multiple.\n\nSHALL might be possible.\n\nBut SHALL has E? No, SHALL is not SHALE. SHALL is S-H-A-L-L, no E.\n\nSPALL? SPALL means to chip or flake off, S-P-A-L-L, which has position: S(1),P(2),A(3),L(4),L(5). Again repeated L.\n\nBut SPALL might not be common; Wordle usually uses common words.\n\nStandard words: SCALP is more common.\n\nSWALY? Not a word.\n\nSo perhaps few options with L at position 5, and often with repeated letters.\n\nBut we have to consider both cases.\n\nNow, for the guess, I need to make a word that fits known constraints and tests the position of L.\n\nOne way is to assume L might be at position 4 and guess a word like SCALP or SCALE, but SCALE has E, excluded.\n\nSCALD: S,C,A,L,D\n\nOr SCAWL? Not a word.\n\nAnother word: SHALY? Not common.\n\nPerhaps better to focus on L at position 4 for simplicity.\n\nBut I need to decide my guess.\n\nSince L could be at position 4 or 5, I should guess a word that has L in one of those positions to test.\n\nFor example, if I guess SCALP, L is at position 4.\n\nIf the secret word has L at position 5, this might not be exact, but feedback will tell.\n\nSimilarly, if I guess SHALL, L at both 4 and 5, but messy.\n\nList of possible secret words based on current info.\n\nSecret word: S _ A _ _\n\nWith _ containing L and another letter? Positions: 2,4,5 need letters.\n\nKnown: L is in the word, so one of position 4 or 5 has L, or both? But possibly only one L.\n\nPosition 2 is separate.\n\nLetters must be from non-excluded set: excluding R,I,E,N,T.\n\nSo available letters: B,C,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,U,V,W,Y,Z, etc.\n\nBut common ones.\n\nPossible words:\n\nFirst, if L at position 4: S _ A L _\n\nThen position 2 and 5: e.g., SCALY: S C A L Y → position 2:C, position 5:Y\n\nSCALP: S C A L P → P at 5\n\nSCALD: S C A L D → D at 5\n\nSHALY? S H A L Y → but SHALY might not be common; SHALY is an adjective, bit obscure.\n\nSHALL: S H A L L → but here position 4:L, position 5:L, so both filled.\n\nSWALY? Not word.\n\nWith other letters: S B A L M? Not word.\n\nS F A L K? No.\n\nSo limited: S_CAL_ words like SCALP, SCALD, SCALY.\n\nNow, if L at position 5: S _ A _ L\n\nThen position 2 and 4: e.g., SHALL which also has position 4:L, but then it\'s S _ A L L, so L at both.\n\nOtherwise, S P A I L, but I excluded.\n\nS C A S L? Not.\n\nS K A I L, I excluded.\n\nSABLE: but S A B L E, positions: S(1),A(2),B(3),L(4),E(5) — but we need position 3 to be A, but here position 2 is A, which we know cannot be, from Guess 1 feedback A not at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, most words with S _ A _ L will have position 3 not A if position 2 is not vowel or something.\n\nDirect words: STALL, but T excluded.\n\nS M A L L: S M A L L → position 2:M, position 3:A, position 4:L, position 5:L. But L at 4 and 5.\n\nSHALL: S H A L L\n\nSWALL? Not, but SWOLL? Not common.\n\nSo possible secret words could be SCALP, SCALD, SHALL, SMALL, etc.\n\nBut SMALL has M.\n\nFor the guess, I need to choose a new word that incorporates what I know.\n\nMy new guess should have:\n- Position 1: S (must)\n- Position 3: A (must)\n- Include L, but not at position 2 (since we know it\'s wrong there, and not at 1 or 3 for obvious reasons), so L at 4 or 5.\n- Cover new letters.\n\nAlso, avoid using excluded letters: R,I,E,N,T.\n\nSo, a good guess might be SCALP: which has S, C, A, L, P.\n- Position: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), P(5)\n- This tests C and P, and places L at position 4.\n\nIf the secret word has L at position 4, this might confirm.\nIf not, for example if L is at position 5, then SCALP might give feedback telling us.\n\nSimilarly, I could guess SHALL: S,H,A,L,L, but repeated L might be less informative.\n\nAnother possibility: using L at position 5, like ""S K A L K"" not word.\n\nI think SCALP is a reasonable choice.\n\nBut there\'s another word: ""SALAD"" — but position: S,A,L,A,D. Position 1:S, position 2:A, but A at position 2 is invalid because we know from Guess 1 that A is not at position 2. So cannot use SALAD.\n\nSimilarly, ""SCAMP"": S,C,A,M,P — S(1),C(2),A(3),M(4),P(5). This has no L?

We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position; so A is present but not at position 2)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word, but wrong position; so S is present but not at position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""slant""
- S: ✓ (correct and in position 1)
- L: - (in the word, but wrong position; so L is present but not at position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct and in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""scalp""
- S: ✓ (correct and in position 1) -> confirmed
- C: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in position 3) -> confirmed
- L: ✓ (correct and in position 4) -> now we know L is at position 4
- P: x (not in the word)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Correct letters in their positions:
   - Position 1: S
   - Position 3: A
   - Position 4: L (from guess 3)

2. Known absent letters: R, I, E, N, T, C, P (from the x's in all guesses)

3. We know the word has S at 1, A at 3, and L at 4. So the word is: S _ A L _

We are missing the second and fifth letters.

4. From guess 1, we know that A was not at position 2 (which we already used) and S not at 4 (but now we have L at 4, so that's consistent).

5. From guess 2, we know L is not at position 2 (which is consistent because now we have L at 4).

Now, the word structure is: [S] [letter2] [A] [L] [letter5]

We need to find which letters can be in position 2 and position 5.

We also know the following letters are absent: R, I, E, N, T, C, P.

So the available letters are the remaining consonants and vowels, but note that we might have a vowel in position 2 or 5? The word must be a valid English word.

Common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, and sometimes Y as a vowel.

We have two positions to guess: position 2 and position 5.

We should consider common words that fit the pattern S _ A L _

Possible words:

- small: S M A L L -> but we have L at position 4 and 5? But in our pattern, position 5 is the last letter. Also, we have an L at 4, so if we put L at 5, that would be ""SMALL"". However, in guess 3, we have L at position 4 correct, but we don't know about position 5 yet. Also, note that in guess 2, we had L at position 2 which was wrong, but that doesn't prevent L from being at position 5.

But let's check the feedback: in guess 2, we had L at position 2 marked as '-' meaning L is in the word but not at 2. If the word is ""SMALL"", then L is at 4 and 5, so it is present. Also, in guess 3, we have L at 4 correct, so that matches.

However, we have to check if ""SMALL"" uses any excluded letters. The letters in ""SMALL"" are S, M, A, L, L. We know M is not excluded (not in the absent list), and L is already known. But we have two L's? That's acceptable.

But note: in guess 3, we guessed ""scalp"" which had P at position 5, which was absent. So in ""SMALL"", position 5 is L, which is different.

Another word: ""shale"" -> but E is excluded, and also position 3 is A? ""shale"" is S H A L E -> but E is excluded, so not possible.

""shalt"": but T is excluded.

""swale"": S W A L E -> E excluded.

""scale"": S C A L E -> but C and E are excluded.

So back to ""small"": S M A L L

Another possibility: ""shall"" -> S H A L L, which is similar.

Or ""stall"": but T excluded.

""spall"": S P A L L -> P excluded.

So the only common words seem to be ""small"" and ""shall"", but we have to check the absent letters.

For ""small"": 
- M is not in the absent list (R,I,E,N,T,C,P are absent, but M is not in that list).

For ""shall"":
- H is not in the absent list.

Also, note that in both words, position 5 is L. So the pattern is S _ A L L.

But we don't know if position 5 is L yet. It could be another letter.

Other words without double L?

For example, ""scaly"": but C is excluded and Y might be possible? But in guess 3, C is excluded, so ""scaly"" has C, which is not allowed.

""scald"": C and D? C is excluded.

""shaly"": S H A L Y -> H and Y. H is not excluded, Y is not excluded. But is ""shaly"" a word? It means resembling shale, but might be obscure. Wordle usually uses common words.

""swaly"": not a word.

So the common words are ""small"" and ""shall"".

But we have to consider that position 5 might not be L. What other words?

For example, ""shalm""? Not a word.

""salad"": but position 2 is A, which we know cannot be because A is fixed at position 3 and we know from guess 1 that A is not at position 2. Also, ""salad"" is S A L A D, so position 3 is L? But we need position 3 to be A. So not.

Another: ""sally""? S A L L Y -> position 2 is A, which is invalid.

So it seems the only common possibilities are words ending with ""AL"" at positions 3-4 and L at 5? Or rather, the pattern is S _ A L and then the last letter.

But in ""small"" and ""shall"", the last letter is L, so it's S _ A L L.

We can also consider ""shawl"": S H A W L -> positions: S(1), H(2), A(3), W(4), L(5). But in our case, position 4 is L (from guess 3 feedback: L is at position 4). So if we have ""shawl"", then position 4 is W? That would contradict because we have L at position 4 fixed.

In guess 3, we have L at position 4 marked as correct (✓), so position 4 must be L. Therefore, the word must have L at position 4.

So the pattern is fixed: positions 1: S, 3: A, 4: L. So the word is: S _ A L _

Position 5 cannot be L? It can be, because we might have two L's? But in the pattern, position 4 is L, and position 5 can be another letter or L.

But in the feedback from guess 3, we have L at position 4 correct, but we don't have information about position 5.

So the word is S _ A L X, where X is the fifth letter.

Now, what can X be? It must be a letter not excluded, and the word must be valid.

Excluded letters: R, I, E, N, T, C, P.

So possible X: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, common words:

- If X = M: ""smalm""? Not a word. But ""small"" has X=L? No, in ""small"", position 5 is L, so it's S M A L L.

Similarly, ""shall"" is S H A L L.

But if we want a word without double L, what are the options?

For example, ""shale"" but E excluded.

""shalt"" T excluded.

""scald"" C excluded.

""swamp"" P excluded and position 4 is M? But we need position 4 to be L.

Another: ""shard"" but R excluded and position 4 is R? Not L.

We must have position 4 as L, so the word must end with ""AL"" plus one letter? No, the word is S _ A L X, so the last three letters are ""ALX"", but with L at position 4.

Examples:
- S _ A L D -> e.g., ""scald"" but C excluded.
- S _ A L K -> ""stalk"" but T excluded, and also position 2 is T? ""stalk"" is S T A L K -> T excluded.
- S _ A L M -> ""smalm"" not a word.
- S _ A L P -> ""scalp"" we tried, and P excluded, and also in ""scalp"" position 5 was P which is absent.

So the only common words that fit are those with the fifth letter being L, making it a double L at the end.

Therefore, the word is likely ""small"" or ""shall"".

Now, we need to distinguish between these two.

We have to guess either ""small"" or ""shall"" or another word that tests the second position.

But we have only two possibilities for the second letter: M or H? Or others?

What about ""swell""? But ""swell"" is S W E L L, but position 3 is E, not A, and E excluded.

""spell"" P and E excluded.

So only ""small"" and ""shall"" are common.

Another possibility: ""stall"" T excluded.

""skull"" has U at position 3? Not A.

So yes, ""small"" and ""shall"".

Now, we can guess one of them.

But we have to make a guess that will give us the answer or narrow it down.

Since we have only two options, we can guess one.

But let's see what letters we haven't tested.

We haven't tested M, H, and others.

In guess 3, we tested C and P, both absent.

We can guess a word that includes M and H? But we only have two positions: position 2 and 5.

Position 2 is the only unknown position that can vary; position 5 is likely L, but we don't know for sure.

But if we guess ""small"", then:
- If it's correct, we win.
- If not, then it must be ""shall"" or another word.

Similarly, if we guess ""shall"", same thing.

But to be safe, we can guess one of them.

But there might be other words? Let's think: ""shoal"" is S H O A L, but position 3 is O, not A.

Not.

""shawl"" is S H A W L, but position 4 is W, not L. But we have position 4 fixed as L, so not.

So only ""small"" and ""shall"" fit the pattern with common words.

Another word: ""slyly""? Not, position 3 is Y.

""sepal"" E excluded.

So I think ""small"" and ""shall"" are the main candidates.

Now, we can guess ""small"" as the next guess.

But let's see the feedback history: we have used S, L, A in multiple guesses, and excluded many letters.

We can also consider that in position 2, we have not tested M or H.

But we have no information about them.

So let's guess ""small"".

If we are wrong, then we know it's ""shall"", and we can guess that next.

But we have 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4, so we have room.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests both M and H, but with only one position to test? It's difficult.

For example, we could guess ""shmoo"" not a word.

Not possible.

So I think we should guess one of the two.

I'll go with ""small"" as it's a common word.

But let's confirm the pattern: S _ A L _

For ""small"": positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:A, 4:L, 5:L -> but position 5 is L, so it's S M A L L.

Similarly, ""shall"": S H A L L.

In terms of the pattern, both have the fifth letter as L, so the word is S _ A L L.

We need to find the second letter.

So the guess should be either ""small"" or ""shall"".

I think ""small"" is a good guess.

But to be thorough, let's see if there are other words with a different fifth letter.

For example, ""shady"": S H A D Y -> but position 4 is D, not L.

Not.

""salty"": T excluded and position 3 is L? Not.

So I think it's safe.

Therefore, I'll guess ""small"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, here's a step-by-step analysis to determine the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Consolidate Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""raise"")**: 
     - R, I, E are absent (x).
     - A and S are present but misplaced (-). A cannot be in position 2, and S cannot be in position 4.
   - **Guess 2 (""slant"")**:
     - S is correct at position 1 (✓).
     - A is correct at position 3 (✓).
     - L is present but misplaced (-), so it cannot be in position 2.
     - N and T are absent (x).
   - **Guess 3 (""scalp"")**:
     - S is correct at position 1 (✓) — confirmed.
     - C is absent (x).
     - A is correct at position 3 (✓) — confirmed.
     - L is correct at position 4 (✓) — confirmed.
     - P is absent (x).
   
2. **Current Knowledge**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 1: S
     - Position 3: A
     - Position 4: L
   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, E, N, T, C, P (cannot be in the word).
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word must be `S _ A L _`, where:
     - The second position (position 2) must be a letter not in the absent list.
     - The fifth position (position 5) must be a letter not in the absent list.
     - L is confirmed at position 4, so it cannot be in position 2 or 5 (unless duplicated, but no evidence yet).
   - **Possible Letters for Positions 2 and 5**: Since R, I, E, N, T, C, P are excluded, the remaining common letters include B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.

3. **Generate Possible Words**:
   - The word must fit the pattern `S _ A L _` and be a valid English word.
   - Common options:
     - **Position 5 = L**: This creates words like `S _ A L L` (double L at the end). Possible words:
       - `SMALL` (position 2 = M)
       - `SHALL` (position 2 = H)
     - **Position 5 ≠ L**: Other letters (e.g., D, G, Y) could work, but no common words fit:
       - `SCALD` (C excluded, invalid).
       - `SHALY` (obscure, not common).
       - `SALAD` (A in position 2, invalid per Guess 1 feedback).
   - **Conclusion**: The only common, valid words are `SMALL` and `SHALL`, both ending with double L. We need to test position 2 (M or H).

4. **Selecting the Next Guess**:
   - Goal: Guess a word that can confirm the secret word or narrow options decisively.
   - Since only two realistic candidates remain (`SMALL` and `SHALL`), guessing one of them will resolve the puzzle:
     - If `SMALL` is correct, we win.
     - If incorrect, `SHALL` must be the answer (and we can guess it next).
   - `SMALL` is chosen as the guess because:
     - It tests the common letter `M` (not yet tested).
     - It adheres to all constraints and feedback.
     - We have 3 guesses remaining (after this), so there's room to adjust if needed.

<guess>small</guess>",small,"We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position; so A is present but not at position 2)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word, but wrong position; so S is present but not at position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""slant""
- S: ✓ (correct and in position 1)
- L: - (in the word, but wrong position; so L is present but not at position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct and in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""scalp""
- S: ✓ (correct and in position 1) -> confirmed
- C: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in position 3) -> confirmed
- L: ✓ (correct and in position 4) -> now we know L is at position 4
- P: x (not in the word)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Correct letters in their positions:
   - Position 1: S
   - Position 3: A
   - Position 4: L (from guess 3)

2. Known absent letters: R, I, E, N, T, C, P (from the x's in all guesses)

3. We know the word has S at 1, A at 3, and L at 4. So the word is: S _ A L _

We are missing the second and fifth letters.

4. From guess 1, we know that A was not at position 2 (which we already used) and S not at 4 (but now we have L at 4, so that's consistent).

5. From guess 2, we know L is not at position 2 (which is consistent because now we have L at 4).

Now, the word structure is: [S] [letter2] [A] [L] [letter5]

We need to find which letters can be in position 2 and position 5.

We also know the following letters are absent: R, I, E, N, T, C, P.

So the available letters are the remaining consonants and vowels, but note that we might have a vowel in position 2 or 5? The word must be a valid English word.

Common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, and sometimes Y as a vowel.

We have two positions to guess: position 2 and position 5.

We should consider common words that fit the pattern S _ A L _

Possible words:

- small: S M A L L -> but we have L at position 4 and 5? But in our pattern, position 5 is the last letter. Also, we have an L at 4, so if we put L at 5, that would be ""SMALL"". However, in guess 3, we have L at position 4 correct, but we don't know about position 5 yet. Also, note that in guess 2, we had L at position 2 which was wrong, but that doesn't prevent L from being at position 5.

But let's check the feedback: in guess 2, we had L at position 2 marked as '-' meaning L is in the word but not at 2. If the word is ""SMALL"", then L is at 4 and 5, so it is present. Also, in guess 3, we have L at 4 correct, so that matches.

However, we have to check if ""SMALL"" uses any excluded letters. The letters in ""SMALL"" are S, M, A, L, L. We know M is not excluded (not in the absent list), and L is already known. But we have two L's? That's acceptable.

But note: in guess 3, we guessed ""scalp"" which had P at position 5, which was absent. So in ""SMALL"", position 5 is L, which is different.

Another word: ""shale"" -> but E is excluded, and also position 3 is A? ""shale"" is S H A L E -> but E is excluded, so not possible.

""shalt"": but T is excluded.

""swale"": S W A L E -> E excluded.

""scale"": S C A L E -> but C and E are excluded.

So back to ""small"": S M A L L

Another possibility: ""shall"" -> S H A L L, which is similar.

Or ""stall"": but T excluded.

""spall"": S P A L L -> P excluded.

So the only common words seem to be ""small"" and ""shall"", but we have to check the absent letters.

For ""small"": 
- M is not in the absent list (R,I,E,N,T,C,P are absent, but M is not in that list).

For ""shall"":
- H is not in the absent list.

Also, note that in both words, position 5 is L. So the pattern is S _ A L L.

But we don't know if position 5 is L yet. It could be another letter.

Other words without double L?

For example, ""scaly"": but C is excluded and Y might be possible? But in guess 3, C is excluded, so ""scaly"" has C, which is not allowed.

""scald"": C and D? C is excluded.

""shaly"": S H A L Y -> H and Y. H is not excluded, Y is not excluded. But is ""shaly"" a word? It means resembling shale, but might be obscure. Wordle usually uses common words.

""swaly"": not a word.

So the common words are ""small"" and ""shall"".

But we have to consider that position 5 might not be L. What other words?

For example, ""shalm""? Not a word.

""salad"": but position 2 is A, which we know cannot be because A is fixed at position 3 and we know from guess 1 that A is not at position 2. Also, ""salad"" is S A L A D, so position 3 is L? But we need position 3 to be A. So not.

Another: ""sally""? S A L L Y -> position 2 is A, which is invalid.

So it seems the only common possibilities are words ending with ""AL"" at positions 3-4 and L at 5? Or rather, the pattern is S _ A L and then the last letter.

But in ""small"" and ""shall"", the last letter is L, so it's S _ A L L.

We can also consider ""shawl"": S H A W L -> positions: S(1), H(2), A(3), W(4), L(5). But in our case, position 4 is L (from guess 3 feedback: L is at position 4). So if we have ""shawl"", then position 4 is W? That would contradict because we have L at position 4 fixed.

In guess 3, we have L at position 4 marked as correct (✓), so position 4 must be L. Therefore, the word must have L at position 4.

So the pattern is fixed: positions 1: S, 3: A, 4: L. So the word is: S _ A L _

Position 5 cannot be L? It can be, because we might have two L's? But in the pattern, position 4 is L, and position 5 can be another letter or L.

But in the feedback from guess 3, we have L at position 4 correct, but we don't have information about position 5.

So the word is S _ A L X, where X is the fifth letter.

Now, what can X be? It must be a letter not excluded, and the word must be valid.

Excluded letters: R, I, E, N, T, C, P.

So possible X: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, common words:

- If X = M: ""smalm""? Not a word. But ""small"" has X=L? No, in ""small"", position 5 is L, so it's S M A L L.

Similarly, ""shall"" is S H A L L.

But if we want a word without double L, what are the options?

For example, ""shale"" but E excluded.

""shalt"" T excluded.

""scald"" C excluded.

""swamp"" P excluded and position 4 is M? But we need position 4 to be L.

Another: ""shard"" but R excluded and position 4 is R? Not L.

We must have position 4 as L, so the word must end with ""AL"" plus one letter? No, the word is S _ A L X, so the last three letters are ""ALX"", but with L at position 4.

Examples:
- S _ A L D -> e.g., ""scald"" but C excluded.
- S _ A L K -> ""stalk"" but T excluded, and also position 2 is T? ""stalk"" is S T A L K -> T excluded.
- S _ A L M -> ""smalm"" not a word.
- S _ A L P -> ""scalp"" we tried, and P excluded, and also in ""scalp"" position 5 was P which is absent.

So the only common words that fit are those with the fifth letter being L, making it a double L at the end.

Therefore, the word is likely ""small"" or ""shall"".

Now, we need to distinguish between these two.

We have to guess either ""small"" or ""shall"" or another word that tests the second position.

But we have only two possibilities for the second letter: M or H? Or others?

What about ""swell""? But ""swell"" is S W E L L, but position 3 is E, not A, and E excluded.

""spell"" P and E excluded.

So only ""small"" and ""shall"" are common.

Another possibility: ""stall"" T excluded.

""skull"" has U at position 3? Not A.

So yes, ""small"" and ""shall"".

Now, we can guess one of them.

But we have to make a guess that will give us the answer or narrow it down.

Since we have only two options, we can guess one.

But let's see what letters we haven't tested.

We haven't tested M, H, and others.

In guess 3, we tested C and P, both absent.

We can guess a word that includes M and H? But we only have two positions: position 2 and 5.

Position 2 is the only unknown position that can vary; position 5 is likely L, but we don't know for sure.

But if we guess ""small"", then:
- If it's correct, we win.
- If not, then it must be ""shall"" or another word.

Similarly, if we guess ""shall"", same thing.

But to be safe, we can guess one of them.

But there might be other words? Let's think: ""shoal"" is S H O A L, but position 3 is O, not A.

Not.

""shawl"" is S H A W L, but position 4 is W, not L. But we have position 4 fixed as L, so not.

So only ""small"" and ""shall"" fit the pattern with common words.

Another word: ""slyly""? Not, position 3 is Y.

""sepal"" E excluded.

So I think ""small"" and ""shall"" are the main candidates.

Now, we can guess ""small"" as the next guess.

But let's see the feedback history: we have used S, L, A in multiple guesses, and excluded many letters.

We can also consider that in position 2, we have not tested M or H.

But we have no information about them.

So let's guess ""small"".

If we are wrong, then we know it's ""shall"", and we can guess that next.

But we have 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4, so we have room.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests both M and H, but with only one position to test? It's difficult.

For example, we could guess ""shmoo"" not a word.

Not possible.

So I think we should guess one of the two.

I'll go with ""small"" as it's a common word.

But let's confirm the pattern: S _ A L _

For ""small"": positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:A, 4:L, 5:L -> but position 5 is L, so it's S M A L L.

Similarly, ""shall"": S H A L L.

In terms of the pattern, both have the fifth letter as L, so the word is S _ A L L.

We need to find the second letter.

So the guess should be either ""small"" or ""shall"".

I think ""small"" is a good guess.

But to be thorough, let's see if there are other words with a different fifth letter.

For example, ""shady"": S H A D Y -> but position 4 is D, not L.

Not.

""salty"": T excluded and position 3 is L? Not.

So I think it's safe.

Therefore, I'll guess ""small"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, here's a step-by-step analysis to determine the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Consolidate Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""raise"")**: 
     - R, I, E are absent (x).
     - A and S are present but misplaced (-). A cannot be in position 2, and S cannot be in position 4.
   - **Guess 2 (""slant"")**:
     - S is correct at position 1 (✓).
     - A is correct at position 3 (✓).
     - L is present but misplaced (-), so it cannot be in position 2.
     - N and T are absent (x).
   - **Guess 3 (""scalp"")**:
     - S is correct at position 1 (✓) — confirmed.
     - C is absent (x).
     - A is correct at position 3 (✓) — confirmed.
     - L is correct at position 4 (✓) — confirmed.
     - P is absent (x).
   
2. **Current Knowledge**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 1: S
     - Position 3: A
     - Position 4: L
   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, E, N, T, C, P (cannot be in the word).
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word must be `S _ A L _`, where:
     - The second position (position 2) must be a letter not in the absent list.
     - The fifth position (position 5) must be a letter not in the absent list.
     - L is confirmed at position 4, so it cannot be in position 2 or 5 (unless duplicated, but no evidence yet).
   - **Possible Letters for Positions 2 and 5**: Since R, I, E, N, T, C, P are excluded, the remaining common letters include B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.

3. **Generate Possible Words**:
   - The word must fit the pattern `S _ A L _` and be a valid English word.
   - Common options:
     - **Position 5 = L**: This creates words like `S _ A L L` (double L at the end). Possible words:
       - `SMALL` (position 2 = M)
       - `SHALL` (position 2 = H)
     - **Position 5 ≠ L**: Other letters (e.g., D, G, Y) could work, but no common words fit:
       - `SCALD` (C excluded, invalid).
       - `SHALY` (obscure, not common).
       - `SALAD` (A in position 2, invalid per Guess 1 feedback).
   - **Conclusion**: The only common, valid words are `SMALL` and `SHALL`, both ending with double L. We need to test position 2 (M or H).

4. **Selecting the Next Guess**:
   - Goal: Guess a word that can confirm the secret word or narrow options decisively.
   - Since only two realistic candidates remain (`SMALL` and `SHALL`), guessing one of them will resolve the puzzle:
     - If `SMALL` is correct, we win.
     - If incorrect, `SHALL` must be the answer (and we can guess it next).
   - `SMALL` is chosen as the guess because:
     - It tests the common letter `M` (not yet tested).
     - It adheres to all constraints and feedback.
     - We have 3 guesses remaining (after this), so there's room to adjust if needed.",Guess 4: small -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(x) A(✓) L(✓) L(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, the user wants me to make the first guess in a Wordle-like game. Since it's the first attempt, I don't have any feedback to work with yet. I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain – ideally covering common letters and a mix of vowels/consonants. 

English vowels are A, E, I, O, U (sometimes Y). Among these, E and A are statistically the most common. For consonants, R, S, T, L, N are frequent. I recall ""ROATE"" is a popular starter among word game enthusiasts because it packs three vowels (O, A, E) and two common consonants (R, T). Hmm, but ""RAISE"" has the same advantages with S instead of T – and S is also very common. Which is better? Let me compare:

ROATE: R, O, A, T, E → Vowels: O, A, E (3), Consonants: R, T (2).  
RAISE: R, A, I, S, E → Vowels: A, I, E (3), Consonants: R, S (2).

Both cover 3 vowels and 2 high-frequency consonants. However, S appears more often than T in English words. Also, if the secret word has plural forms, S might be extra useful. Plus, I gets used more than O. So RAISE seems slightly superior for coverage.

Wait – is RAISE valid? Absolutely, it's a noun meaning to lift up. No exotic letters either, so it should be accepted. Confirming: R-A-I-S-E. Yep!

The goal here is to cast a wide net. RAISE tests R (most common consonant), three top vowels (A, I, E), and S (another top consonant). Whatever feedback comes back – whether greens, yellows, or grays – will immediately narrow down possibilities significantly. For instance:

- If S is correct/green, possibilities shrink dramatically.  
- If E is yellow, I know it's present but misplaced.  
- Even all grays would reveal those five are absent, which is valuable early on.

No point overthinking for a first guess. RAISE is methodically optimal. Let's go with that.For my first guess, I need a word that maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback. I'll choose a word with common letters (vowels and frequent consonants) to cover broad possibilities. A good starting word often includes letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, A, and O. After considering options like ""ROATE"" or ""CRANE"", I select ""RAISE"" – it uses three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), all frequently appearing in English words. This should provide solid initial clues regardless of the secret word.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
I: x (not in the word)
S: - (in the word but wrong position)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and S, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"" (position 2 for A and position 4 for S).
- The letters R, I, and E are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain R, I, E.
- Contains A and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

We also know that A and S are in the word, so we can try to place them in other positions.

Possible positions for A: since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, S was in position 4 and that was wrong, so it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We also need to avoid R, I, E.

Let's think of words that have A and S, and avoid R, I, E.

Common letters we can use: we have A and S already. We can try to use other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are O, U (and sometimes Y). Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that has A and S, and three new letters that are not R, I, E.

We also want to test new positions for A and S.

For example, we can try putting A in position 1 and S in position 3? Or A in position 3 and S in position 1? We have to see what words exist.

Let me think of words that have A and S, and no R, I, E.

Some possibilities:
- A at the start: A _ _ S _ -> but we need to avoid E at the end? Words like ""aunts"" but that has U, N, T, S. But we have to avoid E? ""aunts"" doesn't have E, R, I? Let's check: A, U, N, T, S -> no R, I, E. But we have S at the end? In our feedback, S was in position 4 and was wrong, but now we are putting S at position 5? That's allowed because it's a different position.

But note: we have two letters we know: A and S. We also have three more letters to choose.

We can also consider words with A and S in other positions.

Another idea: since we know A is in the word (but not at position 2) and S is in the word (but not at position 4), we can try to put A in position 1 and S in position 5? Or A in position 3 and S in position 1? etc.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: A in position 1, S in position 5: words like ""atoms"" (but has O, M, T) -> but we don't know if O, M, T are allowed? They are not forbidden yet. However, ""atoms"" has O and M, which are new.

But we also have to avoid R, I, E. ""atoms"" doesn't have R, I, E? A, T, O, M, S -> no R, I, E. So it's okay.

Option 2: A in position 1, S in position 3: words like ""tasks"" (but that has two S's? and T, K) -> but we don't know if K is allowed. Also, ""tasks"" has two S's? T, A, S, K, S? Actually, ""tasks"" is T-A-S-K-S? That's 5 letters: T (1), A (2), S (3), K (4), S (5). But we have S at position 3 and 5? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. But in our case, we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or twice. However, in the feedback for ""raise"", we only had one S and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If the word had two S's, then we would have gotten two '-' for S? But we only had one S in ""raise"", so we only got one feedback for S. So it's possible that the word has two S's? But we don't know.

But in ""tasks"", we have A at position 2? But we are trying to put A in position 1? So that doesn't work.

We want A in position 1: so first letter A.

Words starting with A, containing S, and no R, I, E.

Examples:
- ALOES -> but has E? E is forbidden. So no.
- ATOLL -> no S? doesn't have S.
- ATOMS: A (1), T (2), O (3), M (4), S (5) -> no R, I, E. And S is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed). A is at position 1 (not 2, so allowed). This seems good.

Another: AULOS -> but U, L, O, S? A (1), U (2), L (3), O (4), S (5). No R, I, E. Also valid? Aulos is a musical instrument, but might be obscure.

Another: AUNTS: A (1), U (2), N (3), T (4), S (5). Common word.

We can also try S at the start? But we don't know if S can be at the start? It wasn't in position 4, but we can try position 1.

For example, S in position 1 and A in position 3: words like ""stain"" but has I? I is forbidden. ""stare"" has E? forbidden. ""scalp"" has C, A, L, P -> S (1), C (2), A (3), L (4), P (5). A is at position 3 (not 2, allowed) and S at position 1 (not 4, allowed). And no R, I, E. So ""scalp"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""shalt"" has H, A, L, T -> S (1), H (2), A (3), L (4), T (5). No R, I, E.

But we have to choose one.

We also want to cover new letters to get more information.

In the first guess, we used: R, A, I, S, E -> we know R, I, E are absent, and A and S are present.

So for the second guess, we want to test A and S in new positions, and also test new letters.

We have 5 positions. We can try to put A and S in positions that we haven't tried and that are allowed.

In the first guess, A was in position 2 (wrong) and S in position 4 (wrong). So we can try A in 1,3,5 and S in 1,2,3,5.

But we also want to avoid positions that are already known to be wrong for these letters? Actually, we don't know about other positions. We only know that position 2 is wrong for A and position 4 is wrong for S.

We can try to cover as many new positions as possible for A and S.

Also, we want to include common letters that we haven't tested: like T, N, O, L, etc.

Let me list some candidate words:

1. ATOMS: A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4), S(5) -> tests A at 1 (new), S at 5 (new). Also tests T, O, M which are new.

2. AUNTS: A(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> tests A at 1, S at 5. New letters: U, N, T.

3. SCALP: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), P(5) -> tests S at 1 (new), A at 3 (new). New letters: C, L, P.

4. SHALT: S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), T(5) -> similar to above, but with H and T.

5. PASTA: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5) -> but A is at position 2? We know that position 2 is wrong for A? So we cannot put A at position 2 again? Because we already know it's not there. So that would be a waste. Also, we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, putting A at position 2 again is not useful because we know it's not there. So we should avoid position 2 for A and position 4 for S.

Therefore, in PASTA, A is at position 2 and 5. Position 2 is forbidden for A, so we shouldn't do that. Also, S is at position 3? That's okay, but A at position 2 is invalid.

So we avoid words that put A at position 2 or S at position 4.

Now, among the candidates, which one gives the most information?

We want to test letters that are common and we haven't tried. We haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, M, P, H, etc.

ATOMS: tests T, O, M
AUNTS: tests U, N, T
SCALP: tests C, L, P
SHALT: tests H, L, T

T is a very common letter, so it might be good to include T.

Similarly, N and L are common.

We can also consider words that put A and S in positions that are more central to get more information about the middle.

But let's choose a word that uses common letters and avoids obscure ones.

Another candidate: ""TASKS"" -> but T(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5). But A is at position 2? We know A is not at position 2, so that's invalid.

""PASTY"" -> P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). Again, A at position 2: invalid.

""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This seems good: S at 1 (not 4), A at 3 (not 2). New letters: L, N, T. And no R, I, E.

Similarly, ""PLANS"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), S(5). But S is at position 5? That's okay. But we have A at 3 and S at 5.

""SLANT"" is a good candidate: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). It tests S at position 1, A at position 3, and new letters L, N, T.

We also avoid position 2 for A and position 4 for S? In this word, S is at 1 (not 4) and A is at 3 (not 2). Also, position 4 is N, which is new.

But note: in the feedback, we know that position 4 was S in the first guess and it was wrong, but that doesn't mean that position 4 cannot be another letter. We are free to put any letter at position 4.

So ""SLANT"" is valid.

Similarly, ""SALTS"": S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), S(5). But A is at position 2? That's not allowed because we know A is not at position 2. So invalid.

""OASIS"": O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5). But A at position 2? Invalid. Also, I is forbidden.

So back to ""SLANT"" and ""ATOMS"".

I think ""SLANT"" is a good choice because it tests S at the start and A in the middle, and common letters L, N, T.

Another option: ""SONAR"" but has R? R is forbidden.

""SAUCE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), C(4), E(5). But A at position 2? Invalid and E is forbidden.

So let's go with ""SLANT"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""SLANT"" is a valid English word.

We can also consider ""Casts"" but that has C, A, S, T, S -> but if we spell it as ""CASTS"", then C(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So I think ""SLANT"" is a solid choice.

Alternatively, ""PASTY"" is invalid because of A at 2.

Another word: ""MASON"" -> M(1), A(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). But A at position 2? Invalid.

""BASSO"" -> B(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So we avoid position 2 for A.

What about ""LASSO""? L(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5). Again, A at position 2? Invalid.

So we need a word without A at position 2 and without S at position 4.

""SLANT"" fits: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). S is at 1, A at 3, and position 4 is N (which is new).

We can also do ""SALON"": S(1), A(2), L(3), O(4), N(5). But A at position 2? Invalid.

""TALON"": T(1), A(2), L(3), O(4), N(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So ""SLANT"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""STANK"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), K(5). This is valid: S at 1, A at 3, and new letters T, N, K. But K is less common.

""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This is also valid: A at 3, and S is not in this word? But we know S must be in the word! So we cannot choose a word without S. We must include S.

Ah, important: we must include both A and S in the word because they are present.

So ""PLANT"" has A but not S? So that's invalid because we know S is in the word.

Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has A and S? A at 1, S at 5: yes.

""SLANT"" has S at 1 and A at 3: yes.

""STANK"" has S at 1 and A at 3: yes.

But ""STANK"" has K, which is less common. So ""SLANT"" or ""ATOMS"" might be better.

Between ""SLANT"" and ""ATOMS"", which one?

""SLANT"": letters S, L, A, N, T -> all common.
""ATOMS"": A, T, O, M, S -> also common.

We might want to avoid less common letters. Both are fine.

But note: in ""SLANT"", we are testing L, N, T. In ""ATOMS"", we are testing T, O, M.

We haven't tested any of these, so both are good.

I think ""SLANT"" is a good choice because it tests S at position 1 and A at position 3, which are positions we haven't tried for these letters.

We can also consider ""SALTY"", but S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5). A at position 2? Invalid.

So I'll go with ""SLANT"".

But let's confirm: the word must be 5 letters, English, and not use R, I, E.

""SLANT"": S, L, A, N, T -> no R, I, E. And A is at position 3 (not 2), S at position 1 (not 4). Good.

We could also do ""SNAPS"": S(1), N(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). This has A at 3 (good), S at 1 and 5? But we don't know if S appears twice. However, we are testing S at two positions: 1 and 5. But we already know S is in the word, so if we get a '-' for S at position 1 and/or 5, that tells us about the position. But if we get a 'x' for one of them, it might be confusing? Actually, if we get a 'x' for S at position 1, that means S is not at position 1, but we know S is in the word so it must be elsewhere. Similarly for position 5. But we are using two S's, which might be inefficient if the word has only one S.

But it's acceptable. However, ""SNAPS"" has P and S at position 4? Position 4: we know that in the first guess, position 4 was S and it was wrong, but that doesn't prevent us from putting another letter at position 4. In fact, we are putting P at position 4? The word is S(1), N(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). So position 4 is P, which is new.

But we are using two S's. Since we have limited guesses, it might be better to use five distinct letters to test more letters. But ""SLANT"" has distinct letters: S, L, A, N, T. Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has A, T, O, M, S -> distinct.

""SNAPS"" has two S's, so we are testing only four distinct letters: S, N, A, P.

So for information gain, distinct letters are better.

Therefore, ""SLANT"" or ""ATOMS"" are better.

I think I'll go with ""SLANT"".

So the next guess: SLANT.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, I, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A and S **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A cannot be in position 2, and S cannot be in position 4.

For the second guess:
- The word must include A and S, but avoid positions 2 for A and 4 for S.
- It must exclude R, I, and E entirely.
- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (like T, N, L) and place A and S in new positions not yet ruled out.

The word ""slant"" fits these criteria:
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so allowed).
- A is in position 3 (not 2, so allowed).
- It includes new common letters: L, N, T.
- It avoids R, I, E.
- All letters are distinct, which helps test more possibilities efficiently.

This guess will provide feedback on S at position 1, A at position 3, and the new letters L, N, T, helping narrow down the secret word.

<guess>slant</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to review the feedback from both guesses to understand what I know about the secret word.

From Guess 1 (raise):
- R: x → R is not in the word.
- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I: x → I is not in the word.
- S: - → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E: x → E is not in the word.

So, after Guess 1, I know:
- The secret word contains A and S, but A is not in position 2, and S is not in position 4.
- R, I, E are absent.

From Guess 2 (slant):
- S: ✓ → S is in the word and in the correct position, position 1.
- L: - → L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A: ✓ → A is in the word and in the correct position, position 3.
- N: x → N is not in the word.
- T: x → T is not in the word.

So, combining this with Guess 1 feedback:
- S is in position 1 (confirmed by ✓ in slant).
- A is in position 3 (confirmed by ✓ in slant).
- L is present but not in position 2 (since it got ""-"" in slant).
- N and T are absent (both x).
- Also, R, I, E are absent from before.

Now, I know the secret word has:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- L is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2. Since positions 1 and 3 are taken, L must be in position 2, 4, or 5, but position 2 is not possible because the feedback from slant says L is not in position 2 (given ""-""). So L is in position 4 or 5.

Feedback shows L: -, which means L is present but wrong position. In slant, L was in position 2, so position 2 is incorrect for L. Therefore, L could be in position 4 or 5 (since position 1 and 3 are occupied).

Also, we have three positions to determine: positions 2, 4, and 5.
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: ? (but not L, and not any absent letters)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: ? 
- Position 5: ?

The word must contain L, and L is not in position 2. So L is in position 4 or 5.

Additionally, from absent letters: R, I, E, N, T are all not in the word.

Letters not used yet that could be in: I, E, R are out, N and T are out from Guess 2.

Letters excluded so far: from Guess 1: R, I, E; from Guess 2: N, T. So excluded: R,I,E,N,T.

Common letters that might still be possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

But since L is present, and S and A are fixed, the word has S, A, L, and two other letters.

The secret word is 5 letters: position 1: S, position 3: A, and L somewhere, plus two more characters.

Since L must be placed, and it's not position 2, it's in 4 or 5.

Let me denote the possibilities.

Assume L is in position 4. Then positions would be:
1: S
2: ?
3: A
4: L
5: ?

Or L in position 5:
1: S
2: ?
3: A
4: ?
5: L

Now, position 2 needs a letter that is not excluded. Excluded letters: R,I,E,N,T.

Also, since L got ""-"" in position 2, but position 2 is empty now, so whatever goes there should not be L, which we know.

Now, I need to guess a new word that fits what I know and tests possibilities.

My new guess must:
- Have S in position 1 (since it's confirmed).
- Have A in position 3 (confirmed).
- Include L (since it's in the word), but not in position 2 (and not in position 1 or 3 for that matter), so L should be in position 4 or 5.
- Exclude R,I,E,N,T.
- Position 2 should be a new letter to test.

Moreover, I should avoid using letters that are excluded.

Possible words:

First, let's list English words that start with S, have A in position 3, and contain L.

Position 1: S, position 3: A, and L present.

Examples:

- If L is in position 4: S _ A L _

Words like: SCALP, SCALD, etc., but need to check letters.

SCALP: S, C, A, L, P → positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:A, 4:L, 5:P

But letters: C and P are new, not excluded.

SCALD: S, C, A, L, D → similar, with D.

- If L is in position 5: S _ A _ L

Words like: SHALE, but H and E; E is excluded, so not allowed. SHALE has E.

STALE: has T, but T is excluded.

SPALE? Not a word.

SABLE: S, A, B, L, E → but position 3 is B? No: S (1), A (2?), but in our case position 3 must be A, so S _ A _ L. So word must have second letter anything, position 3 A, position 5 L.

Sable is S-A-B-L-E? S (1), A (2), B (3), L (4), E (5) — but we need position 3 to be A, not position 2. Position 2 here is A, but we know position 2 cannot be A? No, from Guess 1, A cannot be in position 2, but position 2 could be something else.

In secret word, position 2 is unknown, but A is at position 3, so position 2 is not A.

For words with S at 1, position 3 A, and L at 5: S _ A _ L

Examples: SHALL, but SHALL has two L's? S,H,A,L,L? Position 5 is L, but it has L at position 4 too? SHALL is S-H-A-L-L, so positions correspond as needed: S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), L(5). Position 4 and 5 both L? But in this case, L at position 4 or 5.

But SHALL has a repeated L, and position 4 is L.

Another word: SNAIL, but N and I are excluded. N is excluded from Guess 2.

SKYAL? Not a word.

SWAYL? Not a word.

Possible words: SMAWL? Not common.

Perhaps not many with L at position 5.

Other options: SCALY, but SCALY has Y, and position: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), Y(5) — so L at position 4.

SCALY is a word.

So back to when L is at position 4: like SCAL something.

SCALP, SCALD, SCALY, etc.

With L at position 5: harder. SHALL as I thought, but SHALL has position 4: L, position 5: L? In SHALL, it's S-H-A-L-L, so index: 1:S,2:H,3:A,4:L,5:L. So L at position 4 and 5.

If secret word has SHALL, feedback for slant: slant was S,L,A,N,T → position 4 was N, which got x, so if secret word was SHALL, position 4 is L, not N, so x is correct. Position 2 L in slant got -, meaning L is present but not at 2; in SHALL, L is at 4 and 5, so L is present. But we don't know if L is multiple.

SHALL might be possible.

But SHALL has E? No, SHALL is not SHALE. SHALL is S-H-A-L-L, no E.

SPALL? SPALL means to chip or flake off, S-P-A-L-L, which has position: S(1),P(2),A(3),L(4),L(5). Again repeated L.

But SPALL might not be common; Wordle usually uses common words.

Standard words: SCALP is more common.

SWALY? Not a word.

So perhaps few options with L at position 5, and often with repeated letters.

But we have to consider both cases.

Now, for the guess, I need to make a word that fits known constraints and tests the position of L.

One way is to assume L might be at position 4 and guess a word like SCALP or SCALE, but SCALE has E, excluded.

SCALD: S,C,A,L,D

Or SCAWL? Not a word.

Another word: SHALY? Not common.

Perhaps better to focus on L at position 4 for simplicity.

But I need to decide my guess.

Since L could be at position 4 or 5, I should guess a word that has L in one of those positions to test.

For example, if I guess SCALP, L is at position 4.

If the secret word has L at position 5, this might not be exact, but feedback will tell.

Similarly, if I guess SHALL, L at both 4 and 5, but messy.

List of possible secret words based on current info.

Secret word: S _ A _ _

With _ containing L and another letter? Positions: 2,4,5 need letters.

Known: L is in the word, so one of position 4 or 5 has L, or both? But possibly only one L.

Position 2 is separate.

Letters must be from non-excluded set: excluding R,I,E,N,T.

So available letters: B,C,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,U,V,W,Y,Z, etc.

But common ones.

Possible words:

First, if L at position 4: S _ A L _

Then position 2 and 5: e.g., SCALY: S C A L Y → position 2:C, position 5:Y

SCALP: S C A L P → P at 5

SCALD: S C A L D → D at 5

SHALY? S H A L Y → but SHALY might not be common; SHALY is an adjective, bit obscure.

SHALL: S H A L L → but here position 4:L, position 5:L, so both filled.

SWALY? Not word.

With other letters: S B A L M? Not word.

S F A L K? No.

So limited: S_CAL_ words like SCALP, SCALD, SCALY.

Now, if L at position 5: S _ A _ L

Then position 2 and 4: e.g., SHALL which also has position 4:L, but then it's S _ A L L, so L at both.

Otherwise, S P A I L, but I excluded.

S C A S L? Not.

S K A I L, I excluded.

SABLE: but S A B L E, positions: S(1),A(2),B(3),L(4),E(5) — but we need position 3 to be A, but here position 2 is A, which we know cannot be, from Guess 1 feedback A not at position 2.

Similarly, most words with S _ A _ L will have position 3 not A if position 2 is not vowel or something.

Direct words: STALL, but T excluded.

S M A L L: S M A L L → position 2:M, position 3:A, position 4:L, position 5:L. But L at 4 and 5.

SHALL: S H A L L

SWALL? Not, but SWOLL? Not common.

So possible secret words could be SCALP, SCALD, SHALL, SMALL, etc.

But SMALL has M.

For the guess, I need to choose a new word that incorporates what I know.

My new guess should have:
- Position 1: S (must)
- Position 3: A (must)
- Include L, but not at position 2 (since we know it's wrong there, and not at 1 or 3 for obvious reasons), so L at 4 or 5.
- Cover new letters.

Also, avoid using excluded letters: R,I,E,N,T.

So, a good guess might be SCALP: which has S, C, A, L, P.
- Position: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), P(5)
- This tests C and P, and places L at position 4.

If the secret word has L at position 4, this might confirm.
If not, for example if L is at position 5, then SCALP might give feedback telling us.

Similarly, I could guess SHALL: S,H,A,L,L, but repeated L might be less informative.

Another possibility: using L at position 5, like ""S K A L K"" not word.

I think SCALP is a reasonable choice.

But there's another word: ""SALAD"" — but position: S,A,L,A,D. Position 1:S, position 2:A, but A at position 2 is invalid because we know from Guess 1 that A is not at position 2. So cannot use SALAD.

Similarly, ""SCAMP"": S,C,A,M,P — S(1),C(2),A(3),M(4),P(5). This has no L? But L is in the word, so my guess must include L to confirm or test, but actually, I can choose any word, but to be consistent, if I omit L, I might not learn about its position.

Better to include L in the guess to get feedback on its position.

In SCALP, L is included at position 4.

SCAMP does not have L, so feedback wouldn't tell me about L's position.

Since I know L is present, I should keep it in the guess to find where it is.

So SCALP includes L.

SHALL includes L.

But SHALL has repeated L.

SCALD: S,C,A,L,D

Or SCALY: S,C,A,L,Y

All fine.

I'll go with SCALP as it's common and tests new letters C and P.

Position 2 is C, which I haven't tested before.

Similarly, position 5 P.

Feedback will tell if C or P are in the word.

Now, make the guess.### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Review feedback from previous guesses**:
   - **Guess 1: ""raise"" → Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)**  
     - R, I, E are not in the secret word.
     - A and S are present but in wrong positions: A ≠ position 2, S ≠ position 4.
   - **Guess 2: ""slant"" → Feedback: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)**  
     - S is correct in position 1 (fixed).
     - A is correct in position 3 (fixed).
     - L is present but not in position 2.
     - N and T are not in the word.
   - Summary:
     - Known correct positions: S at position 1, A at position 3.
     - Known present letters: L must be in the word, but not in position 2 (from ""slant"" feedback), so L is in position 4 or 5.
     - Absent letters: R, I, E, N, T (excluded from consideration).
     - Secret word structure: S _ A _ _, where positions 2, 4, 5 need letters, with L in position 4 or 5.

2. **Constraints for the new guess**:
   - Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
   - Position 1 must be S (confirmed).
   - Position 3 must be A (confirmed).
   - Must include L (since it's present), but L cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3 (position 1 and 3 are fixed, position 2 is wrong per feedback), so L should be placed in position 4 or 5 to test its location.
   - Cannot use R, I, E, N, T (excluded letters).
   - Should focus on common remaining letters to maximize information: e.g., C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

3. **Generate possible words**:
   - Since S and A are fixed, and L must be included, brainstorm words starting with S, with A in position 3, and containing L not in positions 1-3:
     - If L is in position 4: Words like SCALP (S, C, A, L, P), SCALD (S, C, A, L, D), or SCALY (S, C, A, L, Y).
     - If L is in position 5: Words like SHALL (S, H, A, L, L) or SMALL (S, M, A, L, L), but these have repeated L, which might be less informative.
     - Words must avoid excluded letters (R, I, E, N, T) and position 2 cannot be A (from Guess 1 feedback).

4. **Select the best guess**:
   - ""SCALP"" is a strong choice because:
     - It fits the structure: S (position 1), C (position 2, new letter to test), A (position 3), L (position 4, tests if L is here), P (position 5, new letter).
     - It uses distinct letters (no repeats), which tests more possibilities efficiently: C and P are new common letters to check.
     - Feedback from ""SCALP"" will clarify:
       - Whether C is in the word and correctly placed (if ✓, C is correct at position 2; if -, C is present but wrong position; if x, C absent).
       - Whether L is correctly placed at position 4 (if ✓, L is fixed at position 4; if -, L is present but position 4 is wrong, confirming L must be at position 5).
       - Whether P is in the word.
     - Alternative words like SCALD (ends with D) or SCALY (ends with Y) are less common or might cover fewer common letters.
   - Avoid words with repeated letters like SHALL (S, H, A, L, L) or SMALL (S, M, A, L, L), as they provide less information about other letters due to duplication.

5. **Decision**:
   - Guess ""SCALP"" to efficiently test position 4 for L, introduce new letters (C and P), and confirm/refine the word structure based on feedback.

<guess>scalp</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: scalp -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(✓) L(✓) P(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position; so A is present but not at position 2)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word, but wrong position; so S is present but not at position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""slant""
- S: ✓ (correct and in position 1)
- L: - (in the word, but wrong position; so L is present but not at position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct and in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""scalp""
- S: ✓ (correct and in position 1) -> confirmed
- C: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in position 3) -> confirmed
- L: ✓ (correct and in position 4) -> now we know L is at position 4
- P: x (not in the word)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Correct letters in their positions:
   - Position 1: S
   - Position 3: A
   - Position 4: L (from guess 3)

2. Known absent letters: R, I, E, N, T, C, P (from the x's in all guesses)

3. We know the word has S at 1, A at 3, and L at 4. So the word is: S _ A L _

We are missing the second and fifth letters.

4. From guess 1, we know that A was not at position 2 (which we already used) and S not at 4 (but now we have L at 4, so that's consistent).

5. From guess 2, we know L is not at position 2 (which is consistent because now we have L at 4).

Now, the word structure is: [S] [letter2] [A] [L] [letter5]

We need to find which letters can be in position 2 and position 5.

We also know the following letters are absent: R, I, E, N, T, C, P.

So the available letters are the remaining consonants and vowels, but note that we might have a vowel in position 2 or 5? The word must be a valid English word.

Common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, and sometimes Y as a vowel.

We have two positions to guess: position 2 and position 5.

We should consider common words that fit the pattern S _ A L _

Possible words:

- small: S M A L L -> but we have L at position 4 and 5? But in our pattern, position 5 is the last letter. Also, we have an L at 4, so if we put L at 5, that would be ""SMALL"". However, in guess 3, we have L at position 4 correct, but we don't know about position 5 yet. Also, note that in guess 2, we had L at position 2 which was wrong, but that doesn't prevent L from being at position 5.

But let's check the feedback: in guess 2, we had L at position 2 marked as '-' meaning L is in the word but not at 2. If the word is ""SMALL"", then L is at 4 and 5, so it is present. Also, in guess 3, we have L at 4 correct, so that matches.

However, we have to check if ""SMALL"" uses any excluded letters. The letters in ""SMALL"" are S, M, A, L, L. We know M is not excluded (not in the absent list), and L is already known. But we have two L's? That's acceptable.

But note: in guess 3, we guessed ""scalp"" which had P at position 5, which was absent. So in ""SMALL"", position 5 is L, which is different.

Another word: ""shale"" -> but E is excluded, and also position 3 is A? ""shale"" is S H A L E -> but E is excluded, so not possible.

""shalt"": but T is excluded.

""swale"": S W A L E -> E excluded.

""scale"": S C A L E -> but C and E are excluded.

So back to ""small"": S M A L L

Another possibility: ""shall"" -> S H A L L, which is similar.

Or ""stall"": but T excluded.

""spall"": S P A L L -> P excluded.

So the only common words seem to be ""small"" and ""shall"", but we have to check the absent letters.

For ""small"": 
- M is not in the absent list (R,I,E,N,T,C,P are absent, but M is not in that list).

For ""shall"":
- H is not in the absent list.

Also, note that in both words, position 5 is L. So the pattern is S _ A L L.

But we don't know if position 5 is L yet. It could be another letter.

Other words without double L?

For example, ""scaly"": but C is excluded and Y might be possible? But in guess 3, C is excluded, so ""scaly"" has C, which is not allowed.

""scald"": C and D? C is excluded.

""shaly"": S H A L Y -> H and Y. H is not excluded, Y is not excluded. But is ""shaly"" a word? It means resembling shale, but might be obscure. Wordle usually uses common words.

""swaly"": not a word.

So the common words are ""small"" and ""shall"".

But we have to consider that position 5 might not be L. What other words?

For example, ""shalm""? Not a word.

""salad"": but position 2 is A, which we know cannot be because A is fixed at position 3 and we know from guess 1 that A is not at position 2. Also, ""salad"" is S A L A D, so position 3 is L? But we need position 3 to be A. So not.

Another: ""sally""? S A L L Y -> position 2 is A, which is invalid.

So it seems the only common possibilities are words ending with ""AL"" at positions 3-4 and L at 5? Or rather, the pattern is S _ A L and then the last letter.

But in ""small"" and ""shall"", the last letter is L, so it's S _ A L L.

We can also consider ""shawl"": S H A W L -> positions: S(1), H(2), A(3), W(4), L(5). But in our case, position 4 is L (from guess 3 feedback: L is at position 4). So if we have ""shawl"", then position 4 is W? That would contradict because we have L at position 4 fixed.

In guess 3, we have L at position 4 marked as correct (✓), so position 4 must be L. Therefore, the word must have L at position 4.

So the pattern is fixed: positions 1: S, 3: A, 4: L. So the word is: S _ A L _

Position 5 cannot be L? It can be, because we might have two L's? But in the pattern, position 4 is L, and position 5 can be another letter or L.

But in the feedback from guess 3, we have L at position 4 correct, but we don't have information about position 5.

So the word is S _ A L X, where X is the fifth letter.

Now, what can X be? It must be a letter not excluded, and the word must be valid.

Excluded letters: R, I, E, N, T, C, P.

So possible X: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, common words:

- If X = M: ""smalm""? Not a word. But ""small"" has X=L? No, in ""small"", position 5 is L, so it's S M A L L.

Similarly, ""shall"" is S H A L L.

But if we want a word without double L, what are the options?

For example, ""shale"" but E excluded.

""shalt"" T excluded.

""scald"" C excluded.

""swamp"" P excluded and position 4 is M? But we need position 4 to be L.

Another: ""shard"" but R excluded and position 4 is R? Not L.

We must have position 4 as L, so the word must end with ""AL"" plus one letter? No, the word is S _ A L X, so the last three letters are ""ALX"", but with L at position 4.

Examples:
- S _ A L D -> e.g., ""scald"" but C excluded.
- S _ A L K -> ""stalk"" but T excluded, and also position 2 is T? ""stalk"" is S T A L K -> T excluded.
- S _ A L M -> ""smalm"" not a word.
- S _ A L P -> ""scalp"" we tried, and P excluded, and also in ""scalp"" position 5 was P which is absent.

So the only common words that fit are those with the fifth letter being L, making it a double L at the end.

Therefore, the word is likely ""small"" or ""shall"".

Now, we need to distinguish between these two.

We have to guess either ""small"" or ""shall"" or another word that tests the second position.

But we have only two possibilities for the second letter: M or H? Or others?

What about ""swell""? But ""swell"" is S W E L L, but position 3 is E, not A, and E excluded.

""spell"" P and E excluded.

So only ""small"" and ""shall"" are common.

Another possibility: ""stall"" T excluded.

""skull"" has U at position 3? Not A.

So yes, ""small"" and ""shall"".

Now, we can guess one of them.

But we have to make a guess that will give us the answer or narrow it down.

Since we have only two options, we can guess one.

But let's see what letters we haven't tested.

We haven't tested M, H, and others.

In guess 3, we tested C and P, both absent.

We can guess a word that includes M and H? But we only have two positions: position 2 and 5.

Position 2 is the only unknown position that can vary; position 5 is likely L, but we don't know for sure.

But if we guess ""small"", then:
- If it's correct, we win.
- If not, then it must be ""shall"" or another word.

Similarly, if we guess ""shall"", same thing.

But to be safe, we can guess one of them.

But there might be other words? Let's think: ""shoal"" is S H O A L, but position 3 is O, not A.

Not.

""shawl"" is S H A W L, but position 4 is W, not L. But we have position 4 fixed as L, so not.

So only ""small"" and ""shall"" fit the pattern with common words.

Another word: ""slyly""? Not, position 3 is Y.

""sepal"" E excluded.

So I think ""small"" and ""shall"" are the main candidates.

Now, we can guess ""small"" as the next guess.

But let's see the feedback history: we have used S, L, A in multiple guesses, and excluded many letters.

We can also consider that in position 2, we have not tested M or H.

But we have no information about them.

So let's guess ""small"".

If we are wrong, then we know it's ""shall"", and we can guess that next.

But we have 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4, so we have room.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests both M and H, but with only one position to test? It's difficult.

For example, we could guess ""shmoo"" not a word.

Not possible.

So I think we should guess one of the two.

I'll go with ""small"" as it's a common word.

But let's confirm the pattern: S _ A L _

For ""small"": positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:A, 4:L, 5:L -> but position 5 is L, so it's S M A L L.

Similarly, ""shall"": S H A L L.

In terms of the pattern, both have the fifth letter as L, so the word is S _ A L L.

We need to find the second letter.

So the guess should be either ""small"" or ""shall"".

I think ""small"" is a good guess.

But to be thorough, let's see if there are other words with a different fifth letter.

For example, ""shady"": S H A D Y -> but position 4 is D, not L.

Not.

""salty"": T excluded and position 3 is L? Not.

So I think it's safe.

Therefore, I'll guess ""small"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, here's a step-by-step analysis to determine the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Consolidate Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""raise"")**: 
     - R, I, E are absent (x).
     - A and S are present but misplaced (-). A cannot be in position 2, and S cannot be in position 4.
   - **Guess 2 (""slant"")**:
     - S is correct at position 1 (✓).
     - A is correct at position 3 (✓).
     - L is present but misplaced (-), so it cannot be in position 2.
     - N and T are absent (x).
   - **Guess 3 (""scalp"")**:
     - S is correct at position 1 (✓) — confirmed.
     - C is absent (x).
     - A is correct at position 3 (✓) — confirmed.
     - L is correct at position 4 (✓) — confirmed.
     - P is absent (x).
   
2. **Current Knowledge**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 1: S
     - Position 3: A
     - Position 4: L
   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, E, N, T, C, P (cannot be in the word).
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word must be `S _ A L _`, where:
     - The second position (position 2) must be a letter not in the absent list.
     - The fifth position (position 5) must be a letter not in the absent list.
     - L is confirmed at position 4, so it cannot be in position 2 or 5 (unless duplicated, but no evidence yet).
   - **Possible Letters for Positions 2 and 5**: Since R, I, E, N, T, C, P are excluded, the remaining common letters include B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.

3. **Generate Possible Words**:
   - The word must fit the pattern `S _ A L _` and be a valid English word.
   - Common options:
     - **Position 5 = L**: This creates words like `S _ A L L` (double L at the end). Possible words:
       - `SMALL` (position 2 = M)
       - `SHALL` (position 2 = H)
     - **Position 5 ≠ L**: Other letters (e.g., D, G, Y) could work, but no common words fit:
       - `SCALD` (C excluded, invalid).
       - `SHALY` (obscure, not common).
       - `SALAD` (A in position 2, invalid per Guess 1 feedback).
   - **Conclusion**: The only common, valid words are `SMALL` and `SHALL`, both ending with double L. We need to test position 2 (M or H).

4. **Selecting the Next Guess**:
   - Goal: Guess a word that can confirm the secret word or narrow options decisively.
   - Since only two realistic candidates remain (`SMALL` and `SHALL`), guessing one of them will resolve the puzzle:
     - If `SMALL` is correct, we win.
     - If incorrect, `SHALL` must be the answer (and we can guess it next).
   - `SMALL` is chosen as the guess because:
     - It tests the common letter `M` (not yet tested).
     - It adheres to all constraints and feedback.
     - We have 3 guesses remaining (after this), so there's room to adjust if needed.

Since it\'s the first attempt, I don\'t have any feedback to work with yet. I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain – ideally covering common letters and a mix of vowels/consonants. \n\nEnglish vowels are A, E, I, O, U (sometimes Y). Among these, E and A are statistically the most common. For consonants, R, S, T, L, N are frequent. I recall ""ROATE"" is a popular starter among word game enthusiasts because it packs three vowels (O, A, E) and two common consonants (R, T). Hmm, but ""RAISE"" has the same advantages with S instead of T – and S is also very common. Which is better? Let me compare:\n\nROATE: R, O, A, T, E → Vowels: O, A, E (3), Consonants: R, T (2).  \nRAISE: R, A, I, S, E → Vowels: A, I, E (3), Consonants: R, S (2).\n\nBoth cover 3 vowels and 2 high-frequency consonants. However, S appears more often than T in English words. Also, if the secret word has plural forms, S might be extra useful. Plus, I gets used more than O. So RAISE seems slightly superior for coverage.\n\nWait – is RAISE valid? Absolutely, it\'s a noun meaning to lift up. No exotic letters either, so it should be accepted. Confirming: R-A-I-S-E. Yep!\n\nThe goal here is to cast a wide net. RAISE tests R (most common consonant), three top vowels (A, I, E), and S (another top consonant). Whatever feedback comes back – whether greens, yellows, or grays – will immediately narrow down possibilities significantly. For instance:\n\n- If S is correct/green, possibilities shrink dramatically.  \n- If E is yellow, I know it\'s present but misplaced.  \n- Even all grays would reveal those five are absent, which is valuable early on.\n\nNo point overthinking for a first guess. RAISE is methodically optimal. Let\'s go with that.For my first guess, I need a word that maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback. I\'ll choose a word with common letters (vowels and frequent consonants) to cover broad possibilities. A good starting word often includes letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, A, and O. After considering options like ""ROATE"" or ""CRANE"", I select ""RAISE"" – it uses three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), all frequently appearing in English words. This should provide solid initial clues regardless of the secret word.\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":\nR: x (not in the word)\nA: - (in the word but wrong position)\nI: x (not in the word)\nS: - (in the word but wrong position)\nE: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word contains the letters A and S, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"" (position 2 for A and position 4 for S).\n- The letters R, I, and E are not in the word at all.\n\nWe must choose a new 5-letter word that:\n- Does not contain R, I, E.\n- Contains A and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.\n\nWe also know that A and S are in the word, so we can try to place them in other positions.\n\nPossible positions for A: since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, it can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\nSimilarly, S was in position 4 and that was wrong, so it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nWe also need to avoid R, I, E.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A and S, and avoid R, I, E.\n\nCommon letters we can use: we have A and S already. We can try to use other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are O, U (and sometimes Y). Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word that has A and S, and three new letters that are not R, I, E.\n\nWe also want to test new positions for A and S.\n\nFor example, we can try putting A in position 1 and S in position 3? Or A in position 3 and S in position 1? We have to see what words exist.\n\nLet me think of words that have A and S, and no R, I, E.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- A at the start: A _ _ S _ -> but we need to avoid E at the end? Words like ""aunts"" but that has U, N, T, S. But we have to avoid E? ""aunts"" doesn\'t have E, R, I? Let\'s check: A, U, N, T, S -> no R, I, E. But we have S at the end? In our feedback, S was in position 4 and was wrong, but now we are putting S at position 5? That\'s allowed because it\'s a different position.\n\nBut note: we have two letters we know: A and S. We also have three more letters to choose.\n\nWe can also consider words with A and S in other positions.\n\nAnother idea: since we know A is in the word (but not at position 2) and S is in the word (but not at position 4), we can try to put A in position 1 and S in position 5? Or A in position 3 and S in position 1? etc.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\nOption 1: A in position 1, S in position 5: words like ""atoms"" (but has O, M, T) -> but we don\'t know if O, M, T are allowed? They are not forbidden yet. However, ""atoms"" has O and M, which are new.\n\nBut we also have to avoid R, I, E. ""atoms"" doesn\'t have R, I, E? A, T, O, M, S -> no R, I, E. So it\'s okay.\n\nOption 2: A in position 1, S in position 3: words like ""tasks"" (but that has two S\'s? and T, K) -> but we don\'t know if K is allowed. Also, ""tasks"" has two S\'s? T, A, S, K, S? Actually, ""tasks"" is T-A-S-K-S? That\'s 5 letters: T (1), A (2), S (3), K (4), S (5). But we have S at position 3 and 5? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. But in our case, we know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears once or twice. However, in the feedback for ""raise"", we only had one S and it was marked as present (but wrong position). If the word had two S\'s, then we would have gotten two \'-\' for S? But we only had one S in ""raise"", so we only got one feedback for S. So it\'s possible that the word has two S\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""tasks"", we have A at position 2? But we are trying to put A in position 1? So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe want A in position 1: so first letter A.\n\nWords starting with A, containing S, and no R, I, E.\n\nExamples:\n- ALOES -> but has E? E is forbidden. So no.\n- ATOLL -> no S? doesn\'t have S.\n- ATOMS: A (1), T (2), O (3), M (4), S (5) -> no R, I, E. And S is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed). A is at position 1 (not 2, so allowed). This seems good.\n\nAnother: AULOS -> but U, L, O, S? A (1), U (2), L (3), O (4), S (5). No R, I, E. Also valid? Aulos is a musical instrument, but might be obscure.\n\nAnother: AUNTS: A (1), U (2), N (3), T (4), S (5). Common word.\n\nWe can also try S at the start? But we don\'t know if S can be at the start? It wasn\'t in position 4, but we can try position 1.\n\nFor example, S in position 1 and A in position 3: words like ""stain"" but has I? I is forbidden. ""stare"" has E? forbidden. ""scalp"" has C, A, L, P -> S (1), C (2), A (3), L (4), P (5). A is at position 3 (not 2, allowed) and S at position 1 (not 4, allowed). And no R, I, E. So ""scalp"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""shalt"" has H, A, L, T -> S (1), H (2), A (3), L (4), T (5). No R, I, E.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe also want to cover new letters to get more information.\n\nIn the first guess, we used: R, A, I, S, E -> we know R, I, E are absent, and A and S are present.\n\nSo for the second guess, we want to test A and S in new positions, and also test new letters.\n\nWe have 5 positions. We can try to put A and S in positions that we haven\'t tried and that are allowed.\n\nIn the first guess, A was in position 2 (wrong) and S in position 4 (wrong). So we can try A in 1,3,5 and S in 1,2,3,5.\n\nBut we also want to avoid positions that are already known to be wrong for these letters? Actually, we don\'t know about other positions. We only know that position 2 is wrong for A and position 4 is wrong for S.\n\nWe can try to cover as many new positions as possible for A and S.\n\nAlso, we want to include common letters that we haven\'t tested: like T, N, O, L, etc.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\n1. ATOMS: A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4), S(5) -> tests A at 1 (new), S at 5 (new). Also tests T, O, M which are new.\n\n2. AUNTS: A(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> tests A at 1, S at 5. New letters: U, N, T.\n\n3. SCALP: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), P(5) -> tests S at 1 (new), A at 3 (new). New letters: C, L, P.\n\n4. SHALT: S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), T(5) -> similar to above, but with H and T.\n\n5. PASTA: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5) -> but A is at position 2? We know that position 2 is wrong for A? So we cannot put A at position 2 again? Because we already know it\'s not there. So that would be a waste. Also, we have two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. However, putting A at position 2 again is not useful because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid position 2 for A and position 4 for S.\n\nTherefore, in PASTA, A is at position 2 and 5. Position 2 is forbidden for A, so we shouldn\'t do that. Also, S is at position 3? That\'s okay, but A at position 2 is invalid.\n\nSo we avoid words that put A at position 2 or S at position 4.\n\nNow, among the candidates, which one gives the most information?\n\nWe want to test letters that are common and we haven\'t tried. We haven\'t tried: T, N, O, L, C, U, M, P, H, etc.\n\nATOMS: tests T, O, M\nAUNTS: tests U, N, T\nSCALP: tests C, L, P\nSHALT: tests H, L, T\n\nT is a very common letter, so it might be good to include T.\n\nSimilarly, N and L are common.\n\nWe can also consider words that put A and S in positions that are more central to get more information about the middle.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word that uses common letters and avoids obscure ones.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TASKS"" -> but T(1), A(2), S(3), K(4), S(5). But A is at position 2? We know A is not at position 2, so that\'s invalid.\n\n""PASTY"" -> P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). Again, A at position 2: invalid.\n\n""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This seems good: S at 1 (not 4), A at 3 (not 2). New letters: L, N, T. And no R, I, E.\n\nSimilarly, ""PLANS"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), S(5). But S is at position 5? That\'s okay. But we have A at 3 and S at 5.\n\n""SLANT"" is a good candidate: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). It tests S at position 1, A at position 3, and new letters L, N, T.\n\nWe also avoid position 2 for A and position 4 for S? In this word, S is at 1 (not 4) and A is at 3 (not 2). Also, position 4 is N, which is new.\n\nBut note: in the feedback, we know that position 4 was S in the first guess and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t mean that position 4 cannot be another letter. We are free to put any letter at position 4.\n\nSo ""SLANT"" is valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""SALTS"": S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), S(5). But A is at position 2? That\'s not allowed because we know A is not at position 2. So invalid.\n\n""OASIS"": O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5). But A at position 2? Invalid. Also, I is forbidden.\n\nSo back to ""SLANT"" and ""ATOMS"".\n\nI think ""SLANT"" is a good choice because it tests S at the start and A in the middle, and common letters L, N, T.\n\nAnother option: ""SONAR"" but has R? R is forbidden.\n\n""SAUCE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), C(4), E(5). But A at position 2? Invalid and E is forbidden.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SLANT"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""SLANT"" is a valid English word.\n\nWe can also consider ""Casts"" but that has C, A, S, T, S -> but if we spell it as ""CASTS"", then C(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), S(5). A at position 2? Invalid.\n\nSo I think ""SLANT"" is a solid choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""PASTY"" is invalid because of A at 2.\n\nAnother word: ""MASON"" -> M(1), A(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). But A at position 2? Invalid.\n\n""BASSO"" -> B(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5). A at position 2? Invalid.\n\nSo we avoid position 2 for A.\n\nWhat about ""LASSO""? L(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5). Again, A at position 2? Invalid.\n\nSo we need a word without A at position 2 and without S at position 4.\n\n""SLANT"" fits: S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). S is at 1, A at 3, and position 4 is N (which is new).\n\nWe can also do ""SALON"": S(1), A(2), L(3), O(4), N(5). But A at position 2? Invalid.\n\n""TALON"": T(1), A(2), L(3), O(4), N(5). A at position 2? Invalid.\n\nSo ""SLANT"" seems good.\n\nAnother candidate: ""STANK"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), K(5). This is valid: S at 1, A at 3, and new letters T, N, K. But K is less common.\n\n""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This is also valid: A at 3, and S is not in this word? But we know S must be in the word! So we cannot choose a word without S. We must include S.\n\nAh, important: we must include both A and S in the word because they are present.\n\nSo ""PLANT"" has A but not S? So that\'s invalid because we know S is in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""ATOMS"" has A and S? A at 1, S at 5: yes.\n\n""SLANT"" has S at 1 and A at 3: yes.\n\n""STANK"" has S at 1 and A at 3: yes.\n\nBut ""STANK"" has K, which is less common. So ""SLANT"" or ""ATOMS"" might be better.\n\nBetween ""SLANT"" and ""ATOMS"", which one?\n\n""SLANT"": letters S, L, A, N, T -> all common.\n""ATOMS"": A, T, O, M, S -> also common.\n\nWe might want to avoid less common letters. Both are fine.\n\nBut note: in ""SLANT"", we are testing L, N, T. In ""ATOMS"", we are testing T, O, M.\n\nWe haven\'t tested any of these, so both are good.\n\nI think ""SLANT"" is a good choice because it tests S at position 1 and A at position 3, which are positions we haven\'t tried for these letters.\n\nWe can also consider ""SALTY"", but S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5). A at position 2? Invalid.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SLANT"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: the word must be 5 letters, English, and not use R, I, E.\n\n""SLANT"": S, L, A, N, T -> no R, I, E. And A is at position 3 (not 2), S at position 1 (not 4). Good.\n\nWe could also do ""SNAPS"": S(1), N(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). This has A at 3 (good), S at 1 and 5? But we don\'t know if S appears twice. However, we are testing S at two positions: 1 and 5. But we already know S is in the word, so if we get a \'-\' for S at position 1 and/or 5, that tells us about the position. But if we get a \'x\' for one of them, it might be confusing? Actually, if we get a \'x\' for S at position 1, that means S is not at position 1, but we know S is in the word so it must be elsewhere. Similarly for position 5. But we are using two S\'s, which might be inefficient if the word has only one S.\n\nBut it\'s acceptable. However, ""SNAPS"" has P and S at position 4? Position 4: we know that in the first guess, position 4 was S and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t prevent us from putting another letter at position 4. In fact, we are putting P at position 4? The word is S(1), N(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). So position 4 is P, which is new.\n\nBut we are using two S\'s. Since we have limited guesses, it might be better to use five distinct letters to test more letters. But ""SLANT"" has distinct letters: S, L, A, N, T. Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has A, T, O, M, S -> distinct.\n\n""SNAPS"" has two S\'s, so we are testing only four distinct letters: S, N, A, P.\n\nSo for information gain, distinct letters are better.\n\nTherefore, ""SLANT"" or ""ATOMS"" are better.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""SLANT"".\n\nSo the next guess: SLANT.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R, I, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- A and S **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A cannot be in position 2, and S cannot be in position 4.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include A and S, but avoid positions 2 for A and 4 for S.\n- It must exclude R, I, and E entirely.\n- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (like T, N, L) and place A and S in new positions not yet ruled out.\n\nThe word ""slant"" fits these criteria:\n- S is in position 1 (not 4, so allowed).\n- A is in position 3 (not 2, so allowed).\n- It includes new common letters: L, N, T.\n- It avoids R, I, E.\n- All letters are distinct, which helps test more possibilities efficiently.\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on S at position 1, A at position 3, and the new letters L, N, T, helping narrow down the secret word.\n\n<guess>slant</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'First, I need to review the feedback from both guesses to understand what I know about the secret word.\n\nFrom Guess 1 (raise):\n- R: x → R is not in the word.\n- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 2.\n- I: x → I is not in the word.\n- S: - → S is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E: x → E is not in the word.\n\nSo, after Guess 1, I know:\n- The secret word contains A and S, but A is not in position 2, and S is not in position 4.\n- R, I, E are absent.\n\nFrom Guess 2 (slant):\n- S: ✓ → S is in the word and in the correct position, position 1.\n- L: - → L is in the word but not in position 2.\n- A: ✓ → A is in the word and in the correct position, position 3.\n- N: x → N is not in the word.\n- T: x → T is not in the word.\n\nSo, combining this with Guess 1 feedback:\n- S is in position 1 (confirmed by ✓ in slant).\n- A is in position 3 (confirmed by ✓ in slant).\n- L is present but not in position 2 (since it got ""-"" in slant).\n- N and T are absent (both x).\n- Also, R, I, E are absent from before.\n\nNow, I know the secret word has:\n- Position 1: S (fixed)\n- Position 3: A (fixed)\n- L is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2. Since positions 1 and 3 are taken, L must be in position 2, 4, or 5, but position 2 is not possible because the feedback from slant says L is not in position 2 (given ""-""). So L is in position 4 or 5.\n\nFeedback shows L: -, which means L is present but wrong position. In slant, L was in position 2, so position 2 is incorrect for L. Therefore, L could be in position 4 or 5 (since position 1 and 3 are occupied).\n\nAlso, we have three positions to determine: positions 2, 4, and 5.\n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: ? (but not L, and not any absent letters)\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 4: ? \n- Position 5: ?\n\nThe word must contain L, and L is not in position 2. So L is in position 4 or 5.\n\nAdditionally, from absent letters: R, I, E, N, T are all not in the word.\n\nLetters not used yet that could be in: I, E, R are out, N and T are out from Guess 2.\n\nLetters excluded so far: from Guess 1: R, I, E; from Guess 2: N, T. So excluded: R,I,E,N,T.\n\nCommon letters that might still be possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nBut since L is present, and S and A are fixed, the word has S, A, L, and two other letters.\n\nThe secret word is 5 letters: position 1: S, position 3: A, and L somewhere, plus two more characters.\n\nSince L must be placed, and it\'s not position 2, it\'s in 4 or 5.\n\nLet me denote the possibilities.\n\nAssume L is in position 4. Then positions would be:\n1: S\n2: ?\n3: A\n4: L\n5: ?\n\nOr L in position 5:\n1: S\n2: ?\n3: A\n4: ?\n5: L\n\nNow, position 2 needs a letter that is not excluded. Excluded letters: R,I,E,N,T.\n\nAlso, since L got ""-"" in position 2, but position 2 is empty now, so whatever goes there should not be L, which we know.\n\nNow, I need to guess a new word that fits what I know and tests possibilities.\n\nMy new guess must:\n- Have S in position 1 (since it\'s confirmed).\n- Have A in position 3 (confirmed).\n- Include L (since it\'s in the word), but not in position 2 (and not in position 1 or 3 for that matter), so L should be in position 4 or 5.\n- Exclude R,I,E,N,T.\n- Position 2 should be a new letter to test.\n\nMoreover, I should avoid using letters that are excluded.\n\nPossible words:\n\nFirst, let\'s list English words that start with S, have A in position 3, and contain L.\n\nPosition 1: S, position 3: A, and L present.\n\nExamples:\n\n- If L is in position 4: S _ A L _\n\nWords like: SCALP, SCALD, etc., but need to check letters.\n\nSCALP: S, C, A, L, P → positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:A, 4:L, 5:P\n\nBut letters: C and P are new, not excluded.\n\nSCALD: S, C, A, L, D → similar, with D.\n\n- If L is in position 5: S _ A _ L\n\nWords like: SHALE, but H and E; E is excluded, so not allowed. SHALE has E.\n\nSTALE: has T, but T is excluded.\n\nSPALE? Not a word.\n\nSABLE: S, A, B, L, E → but position 3 is B? No: S (1), A (2?), but in our case position 3 must be A, so S _ A _ L. So word must have second letter anything, position 3 A, position 5 L.\n\nSable is S-A-B-L-E? S (1), A (2), B (3), L (4), E (5) — but we need position 3 to be A, not position 2. Position 2 here is A, but we know position 2 cannot be A? No, from Guess 1, A cannot be in position 2, but position 2 could be something else.\n\nIn secret word, position 2 is unknown, but A is at position 3, so position 2 is not A.\n\nFor words with S at 1, position 3 A, and L at 5: S _ A _ L\n\nExamples: SHALL, but SHALL has two L\'s? S,H,A,L,L? Position 5 is L, but it has L at position 4 too? SHALL is S-H-A-L-L, so positions correspond as needed: S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), L(5). Position 4 and 5 both L? But in this case, L at position 4 or 5.\n\nBut SHALL has a repeated L, and position 4 is L.\n\nAnother word: SNAIL, but N and I are excluded. N is excluded from Guess 2.\n\nSKYAL? Not a word.\n\nSWAYL? Not a word.\n\nPossible words: SMAWL? Not common.\n\nPerhaps not many with L at position 5.\n\nOther options: SCALY, but SCALY has Y, and position: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), Y(5) — so L at position 4.\n\nSCALY is a word.\n\nSo back to when L is at position 4: like SCAL something.\n\nSCALP, SCALD, SCALY, etc.\n\nWith L at position 5: harder. SHALL as I thought, but SHALL has position 4: L, position 5: L? In SHALL, it\'s S-H-A-L-L, so index: 1:S,2:H,3:A,4:L,5:L. So L at position 4 and 5.\n\nIf secret word has SHALL, feedback for slant: slant was S,L,A,N,T → position 4 was N, which got x, so if secret word was SHALL, position 4 is L, not N, so x is correct. Position 2 L in slant got -, meaning L is present but not at 2; in SHALL, L is at 4 and 5, so L is present. But we don\'t know if L is multiple.\n\nSHALL might be possible.\n\nBut SHALL has E? No, SHALL is not SHALE. SHALL is S-H-A-L-L, no E.\n\nSPALL? SPALL means to chip or flake off, S-P-A-L-L, which has position: S(1),P(2),A(3),L(4),L(5). Again repeated L.\n\nBut SPALL might not be common; Wordle usually uses common words.\n\nStandard words: SCALP is more common.\n\nSWALY? Not a word.\n\nSo perhaps few options with L at position 5, and often with repeated letters.\n\nBut we have to consider both cases.\n\nNow, for the guess, I need to make a word that fits known constraints and tests the position of L.\n\nOne way is to assume L might be at position 4 and guess a word like SCALP or SCALE, but SCALE has E, excluded.\n\nSCALD: S,C,A,L,D\n\nOr SCAWL? Not a word.\n\nAnother word: SHALY? Not common.\n\nPerhaps better to focus on L at position 4 for simplicity.\n\nBut I need to decide my guess.\n\nSince L could be at position 4 or 5, I should guess a word that has L in one of those positions to test.\n\nFor example, if I guess SCALP, L is at position 4.\n\nIf the secret word has L at position 5, this might not be exact, but feedback will tell.\n\nSimilarly, if I guess SHALL, L at both 4 and 5, but messy.\n\nList of possible secret words based on current info.\n\nSecret word: S _ A _ _\n\nWith _ containing L and another letter? Positions: 2,4,5 need letters.\n\nKnown: L is in the word, so one of position 4 or 5 has L, or both? But possibly only one L.\n\nPosition 2 is separate.\n\nLetters must be from non-excluded set: excluding R,I,E,N,T.\n\nSo available letters: B,C,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,U,V,W,Y,Z, etc.\n\nBut common ones.\n\nPossible words:\n\nFirst, if L at position 4: S _ A L _\n\nThen position 2 and 5: e.g., SCALY: S C A L Y → position 2:C, position 5:Y\n\nSCALP: S C A L P → P at 5\n\nSCALD: S C A L D → D at 5\n\nSHALY? S H A L Y → but SHALY might not be common; SHALY is an adjective, bit obscure.\n\nSHALL: S H A L L → but here position 4:L, position 5:L, so both filled.\n\nSWALY? Not word.\n\nWith other letters: S B A L M? Not word.\n\nS F A L K? No.\n\nSo limited: S_CAL_ words like SCALP, SCALD, SCALY.\n\nNow, if L at position 5: S _ A _ L\n\nThen position 2 and 4: e.g., SHALL which also has position 4:L, but then it\'s S _ A L L, so L at both.\n\nOtherwise, S P A I L, but I excluded.\n\nS C A S L? Not.\n\nS K A I L, I excluded.\n\nSABLE: but S A B L E, positions: S(1),A(2),B(3),L(4),E(5) — but we need position 3 to be A, but here position 2 is A, which we know cannot be, from Guess 1 feedback A not at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, most words with S _ A _ L will have position 3 not A if position 2 is not vowel or something.\n\nDirect words: STALL, but T excluded.\n\nS M A L L: S M A L L → position 2:M, position 3:A, position 4:L, position 5:L. But L at 4 and 5.\n\nSHALL: S H A L L\n\nSWALL? Not, but SWOLL? Not common.\n\nSo possible secret words could be SCALP, SCALD, SHALL, SMALL, etc.\n\nBut SMALL has M.\n\nFor the guess, I need to choose a new word that incorporates what I know.\n\nMy new guess should have:\n- Position 1: S (must)\n- Position 3: A (must)\n- Include L, but not at position 2 (since we know it\'s wrong there, and not at 1 or 3 for obvious reasons), so L at 4 or 5.\n- Cover new letters.\n\nAlso, avoid using excluded letters: R,I,E,N,T.\n\nSo, a good guess might be SCALP: which has S, C, A, L, P.\n- Position: S(1), C(2), A(3), L(4), P(5)\n- This tests C and P, and places L at position 4.\n\nIf the secret word has L at position 4, this might confirm.\nIf not, for example if L is at position 5, then SCALP might give feedback telling us.\n\nSimilarly, I could guess SHALL: S,H,A,L,L, but repeated L might be less informative.\n\nAnother possibility: using L at position 5, like ""S K A L K"" not word.\n\nI think SCALP is a reasonable choice.\n\nBut there\'s another word: ""SALAD"" — but position: S,A,L,A,D. Position 1:S, position 2:A, but A at position 2 is invalid because we know from Guess 1 that A is not at position 2. So cannot use SALAD.\n\nSimilarly, ""SCAMP"": S,C,A,M,P — S(1),C(2),A(3),M(4),P(5). This has no L? But L is in the word, so my guess must include L to confirm or test, but actually, I can choose any word, but to be consistent, if I omit L, I might not learn about its position.\n\nBetter to include L in the guess to get feedback on its position.\n\nIn SCALP, L is included at position 4.\n\nSCAMP does not have L, so feedback wouldn\'t tell me about L\'s position.\n\nSince I know L is present, I should keep it in the guess to find where it is.\n\nSo SCALP includes L.\n\nSHALL includes L.\n\nBut SHALL has repeated L.\n\nSCALD: S,C,A,L,D\n\nOr SCALY: S,C,A,L,Y\n\nAll fine.\n\nI\'ll go with SCALP as it\'s common and tests new letters C and P.\n\nPosition 2 is C, which I haven\'t tested before.\n\nSimilarly, position 5 P.\n\nFeedback will tell if C or P are in the word.\n\nNow, make the guess.### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n\n1. **Review feedback from previous guesses**:\n   - **Guess 1: ""raise"" → Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)**  \n     - R, I, E are not in the secret word.\n     - A and S are present but in wrong positions: A ≠ position 2, S ≠ position 4.\n   - **Guess 2: ""slant"" → Feedback: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)**  \n     - S is correct in position 1 (fixed).\n     - A is correct in position 3 (fixed).\n     - L is present but not in position 2.\n     - N and T are not in the word.\n   - Summary:\n     - Known correct positions: S at position 1, A at position 3.\n     - Known present letters: L must be in the word, but not in position 2 (from ""slant"" feedback), so L is in position 4 or 5.\n     - Absent letters: R, I, E, N, T (excluded from consideration).\n     - Secret word structure: S _ A _ _, where positions 2, 4, 5 need letters, with L in position 4 or 5.\n\n2. **Constraints for the new guess**:\n   - Must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n   - Position 1 must be S (confirmed).\n   - Position 3 must be A (confirmed).\n   - Must include L (since it\'s present), but L cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3 (position 1 and 3 are fixed, position 2 is wrong per feedback), so L should be placed in position 4 or 5 to test its location.\n   - Cannot use R, I, E, N, T (excluded letters).\n   - Should focus on common remaining letters to maximize information: e.g., C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\n3. **Generate possible words**:\n   - Since S and A are fixed, and L must be included, brainstorm words starting with S, with A in position 3, and containing L not in positions 1-3:\n     - If L is in position 4: Words like SCALP (S, C, A, L, P), SCALD (S, C, A, L, D), or SCALY (S, C, A, L, Y).\n     - If L is in position 5: Words like SHALL (S, H, A, L, L) or SMALL (S, M, A, L, L), but these have repeated L, which might be less informative.\n     - Words must avoid excluded letters (R, I, E, N, T) and position 2 cannot be A (from Guess 1 feedback).\n\n4. **Select the best guess**:\n   - ""SCALP"" is a strong choice because:\n     - It fits the structure: S (position 1), C (position 2, new letter to test), A (position 3), L (position 4, tests if L is here), P (position 5, new letter).\n     - It uses distinct letters (no repeats), which tests more possibilities efficiently: C and P are new common letters to check.\n     - Feedback from ""SCALP"" will clarify:\n       - Whether C is in the word and correctly placed (if ✓, C is correct at position 2; if -, C is present but wrong position; if x, C absent).\n       - Whether L is correctly placed at position 4 (if ✓, L is fixed at position 4; if -, L is present but position 4 is wrong, confirming L must be at position 5).\n       - Whether P is in the word.\n     - Alternative words like SCALD (ends with D) or SCALY (ends with Y) are less common or might cover fewer common letters.\n   - Avoid words with repeated letters like SHALL (S, H, A, L, L) or SMALL (S, M, A, L, L), as they provide less information about other letters due to duplication.\n\n5. **Decision**:\n   - Guess ""SCALP"" to efficiently test position 4 for L, introduce new letters (C and P), and confirm/refine the word structure based on feedback.\n\n<guess>scalp</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: scalp -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(✓) L(✓) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from previous guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""raise""\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but wrong position;

Correct letters in their positions:\n   - Position 1: S\n   - Position 3: A\n   - Position 4: L (from guess 3)\n\n2. Known absent letters: R, I, E, N, T, C, P (from the x\'s in all guesses)\n\n3. We know the word has S at 1, A at 3, and L at 4. So the word is: S _ A L _\n\nWe are missing the second and fifth letters.\n\n4. From guess 1, we know that A was not at position 2 (which we already used) and S not at 4 (but now we have L at 4, so that\'s consistent).\n\n5. From guess 2, we know L is not at position 2 (which is consistent because now we have L at 4).\n\nNow, the word structure is: [S] [letter2] [A] [L] [letter5]\n\nWe need to find which letters can be in position 2 and position 5.\n\nWe also know the following letters are absent: R, I, E, N, T, C, P.\n\nSo the available letters are the remaining consonants and vowels, but note that we might have a vowel in position 2 or 5? The word must be a valid English word.\n\nCommon letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, and sometimes Y as a vowel.\n\nWe have two positions to guess: position 2 and position 5.\n\nWe should consider common words that fit the pattern S _ A L _\n\nPossible words:\n\n- small: S M A L L -> but we have L at position 4 and 5? But in our pattern, position 5 is the last letter. Also, we have an L at 4, so if we put L at 5, that would be ""SMALL"". However, in guess 3, we have L at position 4 correct, but we don\'t know about position 5 yet. Also, note that in guess 2, we had L at position 2 which was wrong, but that doesn\'t prevent L from being at position 5.\n\nBut let\'s check the feedback: in guess 2, we had L at position 2 marked as \'-\' meaning L is in the word but not at 2. If the word is ""SMALL"", then L is at 4 and 5, so it is present. Also, in guess 3, we have L at 4 correct, so that matches.\n\nHowever, we have to check if ""SMALL"" uses any excluded letters. The letters in ""SMALL"" are S, M, A, L, L. We know M is not excluded (not in the absent list), and L is already known. But we have two L\'s? That\'s acceptable.\n\nBut note: in guess 3, we guessed ""scalp"" which had P at position 5, which was absent. So in ""SMALL"", position 5 is L, which is different.\n\nAnother word: ""shale"" -> but E is excluded, and also position 3 is A? ""shale"" is S H A L E -> but E is excluded, so not possible.\n\n""shalt"": but T is excluded.\n\n""swale"": S W A L E -> E excluded.\n\n""scale"": S C A L E -> but C and E are excluded.\n\nSo back to ""small"": S M A L L\n\nAnother possibility: ""shall"" -> S H A L L, which is similar.\n\nOr ""stall"": but T excluded.\n\n""spall"": S P A L L -> P excluded.\n\nSo the only common words seem to be ""small"" and ""shall"", but we have to check the absent letters.\n\nFor ""small"": \n- M is not in the absent list (R,I,E,N,T,C,P are absent, but M is not in that list).\n\nFor ""shall"":\n- H is not in the absent list.\n\nAlso, note that in both words, position 5 is L. So the pattern is S _ A L L.\n\nBut we don\'t know if position 5 is L yet. It could be another letter.\n\nOther words without double L?\n\nFor example, ""scaly"": but C is excluded and Y might be possible? But in guess 3, C is excluded, so ""scaly"" has C, which is not allowed.\n\n""scald"": C and D? C is excluded.\n\n""shaly"": S H A L Y -> H and Y. H is not excluded, Y is not excluded. But is ""shaly"" a word? It means resembling shale, but might be obscure. Wordle usually uses common words.\n\n""swaly"": not a word.\n\nSo the common words are ""small"" and ""shall"".\n\nBut we have to consider that position 5 might not be L. What other words?\n\nFor example, ""shalm""? Not a word.\n\n""salad"": but position 2 is A, which we know cannot be because A is fixed at position 3 and we know from guess 1 that A is not at position 2. Also, ""salad"" is S A L A D, so position 3 is L? But we need position 3 to be A. So not.\n\nAnother: ""sally""? S A L L Y -> position 2 is A, which is invalid.\n\nSo it seems the only common possibilities are words ending with ""AL"" at positions 3-4 and L at 5? Or rather, the pattern is S _ A L and then the last letter.\n\nBut in ""small"" and ""shall"", the last letter is L, so it\'s S _ A L L.\n\nWe can also consider ""shawl"": S H A W L -> positions: S(1), H(2), A(3), W(4), L(5). But in our case, position 4 is L (from guess 3 feedback: L is at position 4). So if we have ""shawl"", then position 4 is W? That would contradict because we have L at position 4 fixed.\n\nIn guess 3, we have L at position 4 marked as correct (✓), so position 4 must be L. Therefore, the word must have L at position 4.\n\nSo the pattern is fixed: positions 1: S, 3: A, 4: L. So the word is: S _ A L _\n\nPosition 5 cannot be L? It can be, because we might have two L\'s? But in the pattern, position 4 is L, and position 5 can be another letter or L.\n\nBut in the feedback from guess 3, we have L at position 4 correct, but we don\'t have information about position 5.\n\nSo the word is S _ A L X, where X is the fifth letter.\n\nNow, what can X be? It must be a letter not excluded, and the word must be valid.\n\nExcluded letters: R, I, E, N, T, C, P.\n\nSo possible X: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nNow, common words:\n\n- If X = M: ""smalm""? Not a word. But ""small"" has X=L? No, in ""small"", position 5 is L, so it\'s S M A L L.\n\nSimilarly, ""shall"" is S H A L L.\n\nBut if we want a word without double L, what are the options?\n\nFor example, ""shale"" but E excluded.\n\n""shalt"" T excluded.\n\n""scald"" C excluded.\n\n""swamp"" P excluded and position 4 is M? But we need position 4 to be L.\n\nAnother: ""shard"" but R excluded and position 4 is R? Not L.\n\nWe must have position 4 as L, so the word must end with ""AL"" plus one letter? No, the word is S _ A L X, so the last three letters are ""ALX"", but with L at position 4.\n\nExamples:\n- S _ A L D -> e.g., ""scald"" but C excluded.\n- S _ A L K -> ""stalk"" but T excluded, and also position 2 is T? ""stalk"" is S T A L K -> T excluded.\n- S _ A L M -> ""smalm"" not a word.\n- S _ A L P -> ""scalp"" we tried, and P excluded, and also in ""scalp"" position 5 was P which is absent.\n\nSo the only common words that fit are those with the fifth letter being L, making it a double L at the end.\n\nTherefore, the word is likely ""small"" or ""shall"".\n\nNow, we need to distinguish between these two.\n\nWe have to guess either ""small"" or ""shall"" or another word that tests the second position.\n\nBut we have only two possibilities for the second letter: M or H? Or others?\n\nWhat about ""swell""? But ""swell"" is S W E L L, but position 3 is E, not A, and E excluded.\n\n""spell"" P and E excluded.\n\nSo only ""small"" and ""shall"" are common.\n\nAnother possibility: ""stall"" T excluded.\n\n""skull"" has U at position 3? Not A.\n\nSo yes, ""small"" and ""shall"".\n\nNow, we can guess one of them.\n\nBut we have to make a guess that will give us the answer or narrow it down.\n\nSince we have only two options, we can guess one.\n\nBut let\'s see what letters we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe haven\'t tested M, H, and others.\n\nIn guess 3, we tested C and P, both absent.\n\nWe can guess a word that includes M and H? But we only have two positions: position 2 and 5.\n\nPosition 2 is the only unknown position that can vary; position 5 is likely L, but we don\'t know for sure.\n\nBut if we guess ""small"", then:\n- If it\'s correct, we win.\n- If not, then it must be ""shall"" or another word.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""shall"", same thing.\n\nBut to be safe, we can guess one of them.\n\nBut there might be other words? Let\'s think: ""shoal"" is S H O A L, but position 3 is O, not A.\n\nNot.\n\n""shawl"" is S H A W L, but position 4 is W, not L. But we have position 4 fixed as L, so not.\n\nSo only ""small"" and ""shall"" fit the pattern with common words.\n\nAnother word: ""slyly""? Not, position 3 is Y.\n\n""sepal"" E excluded.\n\nSo I think ""small"" and ""shall"" are the main candidates.\n\nNow, we can guess ""small"" as the next guess.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback history: we have used S, L, A in multiple guesses, and excluded many letters.\n\nWe can also consider that in position 2, we have not tested M or H.\n\nBut we have no information about them.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""small"".\n\nIf we are wrong, then we know it\'s ""shall"", and we can guess that next.\n\nBut we have 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4, so we have room.\n\nAlternatively, we could guess a word that tests both M and H, but with only one position to test? It\'s difficult.\n\nFor example, we could guess ""shmoo"" not a word.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think we should guess one of the two.\n\nI\'ll go with ""small"" as it\'s a common word.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: S _ A L _\n\nFor ""small"": positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:A, 4:L, 5:L -> but position 5 is L, so it\'s S M A L L.\n\nSimilarly, ""shall"": S H A L L.\n\nIn terms of the pattern, both have the fifth letter as L, so the word is S _ A L L.\n\nWe need to find the second letter.\n\nSo the guess should be either ""small"" or ""shall"".\n\nI think ""small"" is a good guess.\n\nBut to be thorough, let\'s see if there are other words with a different fifth letter.\n\nFor example, ""shady"": S H A D Y -> but position 4 is D, not L.\n\nNot.\n\n""salty"": T excluded and position 3 is L? Not.\n\nSo I think it\'s safe.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""small"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, here\'s a step-by-step analysis to determine the next guess:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Consolidate Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1 (""raise"")**: \n     - R, I, E are absent (x).\n     - A and S are present but misplaced (-). A cannot be in position 2, and S cannot be in position 4.\n   - **Guess 2 (""slant"")**:\n     - S is correct at position 1 (✓).\n     - A is correct at position 3 (✓).\n     - L is present but misplaced (-), so it cannot be in position 2.\n     - N and T are absent (x).\n   - **Guess 3 (""scalp"")**:\n     - S is correct at position 1 (✓) — confirmed.\n     - C is absent (x).\n     - A is correct at position 3 (✓) — confirmed.\n     - L is correct at position 4 (✓) — confirmed.\n     - P is absent (x).\n   \n2. **Current Knowledge**:\n   - **Fixed Positions**:\n     - Position 1: S\n     - Position 3: A\n     - Position 4: L\n   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, E, N, T, C, P (cannot be in the word).\n   - **Word Structure**: The secret word must be `S _ A L _`, where:\n     - The second position (position 2) must be a letter not in the absent list.\n     - The fifth position (position 5) must be a letter not in the absent list.\n     - L is confirmed at position 4, so it cannot be in position 2 or 5 (unless duplicated, but no evidence yet).\n   - **Possible Letters for Positions 2 and 5**: Since R, I, E, N, T, C, P are excluded, the remaining common letters include B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.\n\n3. **Generate Possible Words**:\n   - The word must fit the pattern `S _ A L _` and be a valid English word.\n   - Common options:\n     - **Position 5 = L**: This creates words like `S _ A L L` (double L at the end). Possible words:\n       - `SMALL` (position 2 = M)\n       - `SHALL` (position 2 = H)\n     - **Position 5 ≠ L**: Other letters (e.g., D, G, Y) could work, but no common words fit:\n       - `SCALD` (C excluded, invalid).\n       - `SHALY` (obscure, not common).\n       - `SALAD` (A in position 2, invalid per Guess 1 feedback).\n   - **Conclusion**: The only common, valid words are `SMALL` and `SHALL`, both ending with double L. We need to test position 2 (M or H).\n\n4. **Selecting the Next Guess**:\n   - Goal: Guess a word that can confirm the secret word or narrow options decisively.\n   - Since only two realistic candidates remain (`SMALL` and `SHALL`), guessing one of them will resolve the puzzle:\n     - If `SMALL` is correct, we win.\n     - If incorrect, `SHALL` must be the answer (and we can guess it next).\n   - `SMALL` is chosen as the guess because:\n     - It tests the common letter `M` (not yet tested).\n     - It adheres to all constraints and feedback.\n     - We have 3 guesses remaining (after this), so there\'s room to adjust if needed.\n\n<guess>small</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: scalp -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(✓) L(✓) P(x)\nGuess 4: small -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(x) A(✓) L(✓) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: x (absent)
- A: - (present, but wrong position; so A is in the word but not at position 2)
- I: x (absent)
- S: - (present, but wrong position; so S is in the word but not at position 4)
- E: x (absent)

Guess 2: ""slant""
- S: ✓ (correct at position 1)
- L: - (present, but wrong position; so L is in the word but not at position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct at position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- T: x (absent)

Guess 3: ""scalp""
- S: ✓ (correct at position 1, confirmed)
- C: x (absent)
- A: ✓ (correct at position 3, confirmed)
- L: ✓ (correct at position 4)  [This is new: L is fixed at position 4]
- P: x (absent)

Guess 4: ""small""
- S: ✓ (correct at position 1, confirmed)
- M: x (absent)
- A: ✓ (correct at position 3, confirmed)
- L: ✓ (correct at position 4, confirmed)
- L: ✓ (correct at position 5)  [This is new: L is also at position 5]

Now, let's consolidate:

- Positions:
  - Position 1: S (fixed)
  - Position 3: A (fixed)
  - Position 4: L (fixed)
  - Position 5: L (fixed)  [from the last feedback on ""small"", the second L at position 5 is correct]

But note: ""small"" has two L's: one at position 4 and one at position 5. The feedback for the second L (position 5) is ✓, meaning that position 5 is also L.

Therefore, the secret word has L at position 4 and position 5.

Now, what about position 2? We know it must be a letter that is not excluded and forms a valid word.

From the feedback, we have:

- Absent letters: R, I, E, N, T, C, P, M (from guess 4, M is absent)

Also, from guess 1, we know A is not at position 2, but that's already satisfied because position 2 is not A.

The word structure is: S _ A L L

We need to find the letter for position 2.

The absent letters are: R, I, E, N, T, C, P, M.

So the possible letters for position 2 are the remaining letters of the alphabet, excluding these.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

But the word must be a valid English word.

What words fit the pattern S _ A L L ?

- ""shall"": S H A L L
- ""small"": we tried and got M absent, so not ""small""
- ""stall"": but T is absent (from guess 2)
- ""spall"": P absent (from guess 3)
- ""swall"": not a word
- ""skall"": not common

So the only common word left is ""shall"".

We can also consider ""shill"", but ""shill"" is S H I L L, but position 3 is I, not A, and also I is absent.

Similarly, ""swill"" has I and position 3 is I.

So ""shall"" is the only common word that fits: S H A L L.

Now, we have not tested H yet, but it is not in the absent list.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""shall"".

But to confirm, let's see if it matches all feedback.

- For ""raise"": 
  - R: absent (x) -> correct, not in ""shall""
  - A: present but not position 2 (A is at position 3) -> so (-) is correct
  - I: absent (x) -> correct
  - S: present but not position 4 (S is at position 1) -> so (-) is correct? But in ""shall"", S is at position 1, but in guess 1, S was at position 1? No, in guess 1, ""raise"" had S at position 4? Let's check:

""raise"": positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E

Feedback for S: - (present but wrong position). In ""shall"", S is at position 1, which is not position 4, so it is present and not at 4, so (-) is consistent.

Similarly, E: absent, correct.

For ""slant"": 
  - S: correct at 1 (✓)
  - L: present but not position 2 (in ""shall"", L is at 4 and 5, so present, and not at 2) -> (-) correct
  - A: correct at 3 (✓)
  - N: absent (x) -> correct
  - T: absent (x) -> correct

For ""scalp"":
  - S: ✓ (position 1)
  - C: absent (x) -> correct
  - A: ✓ (position 3)
  - L: ✓ (position 4) -> in ""shall"", position 4 is L, so correct
  - P: absent (x) -> correct

For ""small"":
  - S: ✓
  - M: absent (x) -> correct, since ""shall"" has H, not M
  - A: ✓
  - L: ✓ (position 4)
  - L: ✓ (position 5) -> in ""shall"", position 5 is L, so correct

Therefore, ""shall"" fits all feedback.

So the next guess should be ""shall"".

But we are to make a new guess, and since we are confident, we can guess ""shall"".

In the context, we are on guess 5, so we can guess it.

If we want to be formal, we can output it.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Guess 4 (""small"")**:
   - **S(✓)**: Position 1 is confirmed as S (consistent with Guess 2 and 3).
   - **M(x)**: M is absent from the secret word.
   - **A(✓)**: Position 3 is confirmed as A (consistent with Guess 2 and 3).
   - **L(✓)**: Position 4 is confirmed as L (consistent with Guess 3).
   - **L(✓)**: Position 5 is now confirmed as L.  
     **→ Key Insight**: The secret word ends with double L (positions 4 and 5 are both L). The word structure is **S _ A L L**.

2. **Update Constraints**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 1: S
     - Position 3: A
     - Position 4: L
     - Position 5: L
   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, E, N, T, C, P, M (from all feedback).
   - **Position 2 Requirements**:
     - Must be a letter not in the absent list (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, O, U, V, W, Y).
     - Must form a valid English word with the structure `S _ A L L`.

3. **Identify Possible Words**:
   - Common words fitting `S _ A L L`:
     - **SHALL** (position 2 = H).
     - Other possibilities like ""SMALL"" (tested and rejected due to M(x)), ""STALL"" (T absent), or ""SPALL"" (P absent) are invalid.
   - **Conclusion**: ""SHALL"" is the **only common English word** that matches the pattern and feedback. It uses H (not excluded) and aligns with all prior clues:
     - H has not been tested yet (not in absent list).
     - ""SHALL"" contains S, A, and L in their correct positions, with H in position 2.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - Guess **""shall""** to solve the puzzle. If correct, it wins; if not, it would contradict all feedback (but no other valid words exist).

Therefore, the secret word has L at position 4 and position 5.

We can also consider ""shill"", but ""shill"" is S H I L L, but position 3 is I, not A, and also I is absent.

Similarly, ""swill"" has I and position 3 is I.

So ""shall"" is the only common word that fits: S H A L L.

Similarly, E: absent, correct.

  - T: absent (x) -> correct

For ""scalp"":
  - S: ✓ (position 1)
  - C: absent (x) -> correct
  - A: ✓ (position 3)
  - L: ✓ (position 4) -> in ""shall"", position 4 is L, so correct
  - P: absent (x) -> correct
