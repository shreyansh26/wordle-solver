We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters to maximize information.
 A good starting word usually has common letters (like vowels and frequent consonants) and no repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AUDIO"", etc.

 Let me choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
   S: common consonant
   L: common consonant
   A: common vowel
   T: common consonant
   E: common vowel

 This gives us a good spread of common letters.

 So, for the first guess, we'll guess: SLATE
</think>
<thinking>
For the first guess with no prior information, I need a word that maximizes the information gained about the secret word. A good starting word should:
- Contain common letters to increase the chance of hitting correct letters
- Include a mix of vowels and common consonants
- Avoid repeated letters to cover more possibilities

Words like ""SLATE"" are strong openers because they include:
- Vowels: A and E
- Common consonants: S, L, T
- All unique letters

""CRANE"" is another excellent choice for similar reasons. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- C and R are very common consonants
- A and E are top vowels
- N is also relatively frequent

This combination should provide meaningful feedback across multiple letter positions while testing common English patterns.

We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position.
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Since A is present but not in position 3, it must be in one of the other positions: 1,2,4, or 5.

 For our second guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
 - Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word)
 - Does not include C, R, N, E (since they are confirmed absent)
 - We should avoid repeating letters if possible to maximize information.

 Also, since A is not in position 3, we should place A in a different position (1,2,4, or 5).

 Ideas for second guess:
 - We want a word that includes A and other common letters not excluded. Excluded letters: C,R,N,E.

 Common letters in English include: S,T,L,I,O,B,D,G,H,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y etc.

 Let's think of words that contain A, and avoid C,R,N,E.

 Possible words:
 - ""salad"" -> but repeated letters (A twice) - maybe not optimal
 - ""salsa"" -> repeated S and A, and only 4 letters? No, S A L S A -> not 5 distinct, and repeated letters might not give as much information.
 - ""plate"" -> contains E -> excluded
 - ""blast"" -> avoid: has S,T,L,B,A -> let's check: B,L,A,S,T. This avoids the excluded letters.

 Word: ""blast""
   Positions: B(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)

 However, note that in the previous feedback, A was not in position 3. But here we put A in position 3? That would be against the feedback?
 Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot place A in position 3 again.

 Therefore, we must put A in a position that isn't 3.

 Alternative words:

 Let's try to put A in position 1: 
   Example: ""adios"" -> contains D,I,O,S. But we don't know if D,I,O,S are safe? 
   But note: we want to test new letters.

 However, ""adios"" contains S and O, which are common.

 Another idea: ""about"" -> contains B,O,U,T. But we don't know about these letters.

 How about ""stamp""? 
   - S,T,A,M,P. 
   - A is in position 3? -> but we know A is not in position 3. So we cannot put A in position 3 again.
   So move A to a different position.

 We can try ""patsy"": 
   - P(1), A(2), T(3), S(4), Y(5) -> A is in position 2.

 Avoid any word that has A in position 3.

 Also, avoid C,R,N,E.

 Another good candidate: ""aisle"" -> contains E? Yes -> excluded.

 Avoid E.

 So, let's try ""salty"": 
   - S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5): 
   A is in position 2 -> good because it was not in position 3 and we avoid placing it in 3.

 But note: we don't know if S,L,T,Y are in the word? We want to test.

 Another: ""valid"": contains V,A,L,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E. 
   Positions: V(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), D(5) -> A in position 2.

 However, note that we haven't tested T,S,H,O,M,P etc.

 Since we excluded four letters (C,R,N,E) and know A is one letter, we have 21 letters left? Actually, 26-5=21 letters available.

 We need to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Considering commonality: T is very frequent, S is frequent, etc.

 So words like ""taffy"" -> repeated F, bad. 

 How about ""bails""? 
   B(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> A in position 2, avoids E, avoids C,R,N, and introduces B,I,L,S.

 Also, we are testing 4 new letters: B,I,L,S.

 However, note position 3: I? We have no information about that.

 Alternatively, ""daisy"": 
   D(1),A(2),I(3),S(4),Y(5) -> similar, introduces D,I,S,Y and A.

 Both seem okay.

 But note: we must avoid E? yes. Both avoid.

 Another idea: ""basil"" -> 
   B(1),A(2),S(3),I(4),L(5) -> again A in position 2.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word might have an A in position 1,2,4,5.

 We need to test positions differently? 

 Since we know A is present and not in position 3, testing it in position 2 (for example) will help us determine if that's its spot or not.

 Alternatively, we might avoid position 2 as well? Not necessary, because we don't have a reason to avoid position 2. The previous feedback didn't rule out any position for A except position 3.

 So, let's go with a word that has A in a new position (like 2) and tests many common letters.

 ""BASAL"" -> repeated A, avoid.

 ""BASIL"": 
   Letters: B, A, S, I, L -> all distinct. And A in position 2? Actually, in ""basil"" the positions are:
   B-A-S-I-L? Wait, no: 
   Position 1: B
   Position 2: A
   Position 3: S
   Position 4: I
   Position 5: L

 But wait, the word ""basil"" is 5 letters? Yes.

 However, note that ""salad"" has two A's and we avoid repeated to get more information. So ""basil"" with distinct letters is better.

 Alternatively, ""habit"": 
   H(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), T(5) -> A in position 2. 

 Or ""macho"" -> but wait, M,A,C,H,O -> C is excluded? Yes! We cannot use C because it's excluded.

 So ""habit"": contains H,A,B,I,T -> avoids the excluded letters.

 Similarly, ""gawky"": G,A,W,K,Y -> avoids exclusions, but not very common? 

 We should aim for words that use common consonants and vowels.

 Another choice: ""pastel"" -> contains E -> excluded.

 So between ""basil"", ""bails"", ""daisy"", ""habit"", etc.

 I think ""habit"" is good because it uses T and H, which are common. 
 And it places A in position 2? But maybe the secret word has A in position 1,4,5? 

 Actually, we are testing position 2: if we put A in position 2 and it is correct, then we know. If not, then we know A is not in position 2 either? 

 Alternatively, we could test A in a different position to get more coverage? 

 For example, testing A in position 1 or 4 or 5. 

 Let me try to get A not in position 2 or 3.

 How about ""piano"" -> contains O, but also A in position 3? -> but we cannot place A in position 3.

 ""piano"" has A at position 3 -> invalid because we know A isn't in position 3.

 So words with A at positions 1,2,4,5.

 Position 1: ""adult"", ""abyss"", etc... but ""abyss"" has repeated S? So not distinct.

 Similarly, ""agile"" -> contains E? excluded.

 ""daily"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> A in position 2? Wait: 
   D(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5) -> A in position 2.

 Same as before.

 How about putting A in position 4? 
   Example: ""spade"" -> contains E? excluded.

 Without E: ""draft"" -> D(1), R(2), A(3), F(4), T(5) -> A in position 3? Invalid.

 ""focal"" -> contains C? excluded.

 ""latch"" -> L(1), A(2), T(3), C(4), H(5) -> C excluded? yes.

 It's tricky.

 Another word with A at position 4: ""ultra"" -> 
   U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5) -> but R is excluded? We got R: x in the first guess.

 So we can't use R.

 Put A at position 5: 
   ""mania"" -> repeated A? and also contains N? which is excluded.

 ""scuba"" -> S(1), C(2), U(3), B(4), A(5) -> contains C? excluded.

 ""vodka"" -> V(1), O(2), D(3), K(4), A(5) -> avoids excluded letters? 
   Check: excluded are C,R,N,E -> V,O,D,K,A (A is allowed) -> V,O,D,K are new.

 But we know A is present, so we must include A anyway? Yes, but we are putting A at position 5.

 Alternatively, ""tidal"": 
   T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5) -> A at position 4? 
   But ""tidal"" has L at the end? Yes.

 Now we test A at position 4.

 Similarly, ""viral"" -> but contains R? excluded.

 So ""tidal"": 
   Letters: T, I, D, A, L -> avoids excluded letters? 
   T, I, D, A, L -> none of them are C,R,N,E? Good.

 But note: we tested A in position 4? 

 However, ""tidal"" uses T, I, D, A, L.

 Another alternative: ""staid"": 
   S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5) -> but A is in position 3? which we know is not allowed.

 Therefore, for guess 2:

 Option 1: ""TIDAL"" (with A at 4) 
   -> T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5)

 Option 2: ""BASIL"" (with A at 2) 
   -> B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), L(5)

 Both introduce common letters.

 Considering letter frequency: 
   T is very common, S is very common, L and I are common too.

 So both words are good. 

 However, note that we also want to test letters that might be in the word. Since the first guess only gave us one letter (A) present, we have four more to find.

 We decide: Let's go with ""tidal"" because it places A in a position we haven't tested (position 4). The previous guess had A in position 3? We know that was wrong, so testing A in position 4 might be better than position 2? 

 Actually, testing the same letter in a different position is good if that position is likely.

 But we don't have much information, so it's arbitrary.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that also tests vowels that we haven't checked? 

 We know E is out? So vowels remaining: A is already known. Then: I, O, U? 

 We haven't tested O or U? But I is in both ""tidal"" and ""basil"".

 How about ""audio""? 
   - A(1), U(2), D(3), I(4), O(5) 
   - Avoids exclusions? 
   - But we know A is present, and we put it in position 1? 
   - Also, we test U, D, I, O.

 And all distinct letters? Yes.

 Also, we avoid the excluded letters: no C,R,N,E.

 Let's consider ""audio"":
   - Tests A at position 1? 
   - Tests U, D, I, O.

 Since we know A is in the word, putting it at position 1 might give us more information? 

 Then let's compare:

 Option 3: ""AUDIO"" -> which is a classical starting word? 

 But we already made one guess.

 ""AUDIO"" has A at position 1: might be correct? Or it might not.

 Now, comparing the choices:

 - ""AUDIO"": 
     Letters: A, U, D, I, O -> tests vowels and D? And positions: we haven't seen position 1? 

 - ""BASIL"": 
     Letters: B,A,S,I,L -> consonants B,S,L and vowels A,I.

 - ""TIDAL"": 
     Letters: T,I,D,A,L -> similar to AUDIO? But T/L instead of U/O.

 Actually, ""tidal"" has T and D? So quite different.

 Since we are more in the dark? But we have the constraint on A: it cannot be in position 3.

 So ""audio"": 
   Positions: A(1), U(2), D(3), I(4), O(5)

 Let me see if ""audio"" is a valid word? Yes.

 It tests:
   A in position 1 (was previously tested in position 3 and was wrong? Now we test if it is in position 1).
   Plus we test U,D,I,O.

 The feedback might be very informative.

 But note: if A is not in position 1, then we get a '-' for A? Then we know A must be in position 4 or 5? (or 2? but we put U at 2) 

 Actually, we test position 1 for A? If it's not correct, then A must be in one of the positions: 2,4,5? 

 But wait, in the word ""audio"", the positions: 
   If A is in the secret word but not in position 1, then it must be in position 2? But we put U at 2. Or in position 4? We have I at 4? Or position 5? We have O at 5. 

 Since the letters in positions 2,4,5 are all unique? Yes, so if A is in the word but not at 1, then it might show as in position 2? but actually we have U at 2, etc. 

 Actually: the feedback will tell us if A is present? We already know it's in the word, so the feedback symbol for A will be either:
   - ✓ if it is in the correct position? Then position 1 is green.
   - - if it is in the word but in a different position? Then we know A is not in position 1.

 Similarly, for other letters.

 So I think ""audio"" is a good guess for the second attempt.

 But note: we are testing only one vowel? Actually, we test A,U,I,O? Quite vowel-heavy? But vowels are important.

 However, the secret word might have only one vowel? But A is already one, and we are testing two more? 

 Given that five-letter words usually have several vowels, it's okay.

 Alternatively, we can use ""tidal"" to test T and D? 

 Considering frequency of letters? We have excluded E, which is very frequent. Then T is the most frequent letter? 

 So testing T might be important.

 Therefore, let me propose:

 Option 4: ""TOAST"" -> but repeated T? and A at position 3? Not allowed.

 How about ""LASTS""? -> repeated S? and A at position 2? But we haven't tested S,L? 

 But ""lasts"" has repeated S: not ideal.

 Then, let's choose ""tidal"" or ""audio""?

 Since T is so common, maybe ""tidal"" is better? 

 But ""tidal"" also introduces T? 

 Actually, both ""audio"" and ""tidal"" have distinct letters, so they are equally good? 

 Let me choose ""audio"": 
   Why? Because it tests multiple vowels. Since the word contains A, which is a vowel, it might have other vowels? 

 And if ""audio"" doesn't give us any additional letters? Then we know that U,D,I,O are absent? 

 But also, we get positional information.

 Alternatively, I found ""paint"": 
   P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> contains N? Excluded -> invalid.

 ""light"": doesn't have A? We must include A because we know it's present? Otherwise we waste? 

 Yes, we know A is in the word? So if we don't include A in the guess, we won't get feedback about its position? 

 And we still need to locate A.

 Therefore, we must include A.

 So back to including A: words like ""audio"", ""basil"", ""tidal"", ""habit"", etc.

 I'll go with ""audio"".
</think>
<thinking>
The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" provided critical information:
- C, R, N, and E are not in the word at all (marked ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in the third position (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Since A must be present, it should be included but not in position 3.
- Avoid C, R, N, E entirely, as they have been eliminated.
- Test new common letters to maximize information gain, prioritizing other vowels and consonants.
- Position A in a different spot—position 1, 2, 4, or 5—to narrow down its location.

Considering words that meet these criteria:
- ""AUDIO"" is a strong candidate: 
  - Includes A (position 1), avoiding position 3.
  - Avoids C, R, N, E.
  - Tests three new vowels (U, I, O) and one consonant (D), which are common and could reveal additional vowels or positional data.
  - All distinct letters minimize redundancy.

Other options like ""BASIL"" (A in position 2) or ""TIDAL"" (A in position 4) are also valid, but ""AUDIO"" efficiently tests multiple new vowels at once, leveraging the elimination of E to prioritize less frequent vowels (U, I, O). This could provide quick insights into vowel placement and frequency.
</thinking>

<guess>audio</guess>",audio,"We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position.
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Since A is present but not in position 3, it must be in one of the other positions: 1,2,4, or 5.

 For our second guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
 - Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word)
 - Does not include C, R, N, E (since they are confirmed absent)
 - We should avoid repeating letters if possible to maximize information.

 Also, since A is not in position 3, we should place A in a different position (1,2,4, or 5).

 Ideas for second guess:
 - We want a word that includes A and other common letters not excluded. Excluded letters: C,R,N,E.

 Common letters in English include: S,T,L,I,O,B,D,G,H,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y etc.

 Let's think of words that contain A, and avoid C,R,N,E.

 Possible words:
 - ""salad"" -> but repeated letters (A twice) - maybe not optimal
 - ""salsa"" -> repeated S and A, and only 4 letters? No, S A L S A -> not 5 distinct, and repeated letters might not give as much information.
 - ""plate"" -> contains E -> excluded
 - ""blast"" -> avoid: has S,T,L,B,A -> let's check: B,L,A,S,T. This avoids the excluded letters.

 Word: ""blast""
   Positions: B(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)

 However, note that in the previous feedback, A was not in position 3. But here we put A in position 3? That would be against the feedback?
 Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot place A in position 3 again.

 Therefore, we must put A in a position that isn't 3.

 Alternative words:

 Let's try to put A in position 1: 
   Example: ""adios"" -> contains D,I,O,S. But we don't know if D,I,O,S are safe? 
   But note: we want to test new letters.

 However, ""adios"" contains S and O, which are common.

 Another idea: ""about"" -> contains B,O,U,T. But we don't know about these letters.

 How about ""stamp""? 
   - S,T,A,M,P. 
   - A is in position 3? -> but we know A is not in position 3. So we cannot put A in position 3 again.
   So move A to a different position.

 We can try ""patsy"": 
   - P(1), A(2), T(3), S(4), Y(5) -> A is in position 2.

 Avoid any word that has A in position 3.

 Also, avoid C,R,N,E.

 Another good candidate: ""aisle"" -> contains E? Yes -> excluded.

 Avoid E.

 So, let's try ""salty"": 
   - S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5): 
   A is in position 2 -> good because it was not in position 3 and we avoid placing it in 3.

 But note: we don't know if S,L,T,Y are in the word? We want to test.

 Another: ""valid"": contains V,A,L,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E. 
   Positions: V(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), D(5) -> A in position 2.

 However, note that we haven't tested T,S,H,O,M,P etc.

 Since we excluded four letters (C,R,N,E) and know A is one letter, we have 21 letters left? Actually, 26-5=21 letters available.

 We need to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Considering commonality: T is very frequent, S is frequent, etc.

 So words like ""taffy"" -> repeated F, bad. 

 How about ""bails""? 
   B(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> A in position 2, avoids E, avoids C,R,N, and introduces B,I,L,S.

 Also, we are testing 4 new letters: B,I,L,S.

 However, note position 3: I? We have no information about that.

 Alternatively, ""daisy"": 
   D(1),A(2),I(3),S(4),Y(5) -> similar, introduces D,I,S,Y and A.

 Both seem okay.

 But note: we must avoid E? yes. Both avoid.

 Another idea: ""basil"" -> 
   B(1),A(2),S(3),I(4),L(5) -> again A in position 2.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word might have an A in position 1,2,4,5.

 We need to test positions differently? 

 Since we know A is present and not in position 3, testing it in position 2 (for example) will help us determine if that's its spot or not.

 Alternatively, we might avoid position 2 as well? Not necessary, because we don't have a reason to avoid position 2. The previous feedback didn't rule out any position for A except position 3.

 So, let's go with a word that has A in a new position (like 2) and tests many common letters.

 ""BASAL"" -> repeated A, avoid.

 ""BASIL"": 
   Letters: B, A, S, I, L -> all distinct. And A in position 2? Actually, in ""basil"" the positions are:
   B-A-S-I-L? Wait, no: 
   Position 1: B
   Position 2: A
   Position 3: S
   Position 4: I
   Position 5: L

 But wait, the word ""basil"" is 5 letters? Yes.

 However, note that ""salad"" has two A's and we avoid repeated to get more information. So ""basil"" with distinct letters is better.

 Alternatively, ""habit"": 
   H(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), T(5) -> A in position 2. 

 Or ""macho"" -> but wait, M,A,C,H,O -> C is excluded? Yes! We cannot use C because it's excluded.

 So ""habit"": contains H,A,B,I,T -> avoids the excluded letters.

 Similarly, ""gawky"": G,A,W,K,Y -> avoids exclusions, but not very common? 

 We should aim for words that use common consonants and vowels.

 Another choice: ""pastel"" -> contains E -> excluded.

 So between ""basil"", ""bails"", ""daisy"", ""habit"", etc.

 I think ""habit"" is good because it uses T and H, which are common. 
 And it places A in position 2? But maybe the secret word has A in position 1,4,5? 

 Actually, we are testing position 2: if we put A in position 2 and it is correct, then we know. If not, then we know A is not in position 2 either? 

 Alternatively, we could test A in a different position to get more coverage? 

 For example, testing A in position 1 or 4 or 5. 

 Let me try to get A not in position 2 or 3.

 How about ""piano"" -> contains O, but also A in position 3? -> but we cannot place A in position 3.

 ""piano"" has A at position 3 -> invalid because we know A isn't in position 3.

 So words with A at positions 1,2,4,5.

 Position 1: ""adult"", ""abyss"", etc... but ""abyss"" has repeated S? So not distinct.

 Similarly, ""agile"" -> contains E? excluded.

 ""daily"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> A in position 2? Wait: 
   D(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5) -> A in position 2.

 Same as before.

 How about putting A in position 4? 
   Example: ""spade"" -> contains E? excluded.

 Without E: ""draft"" -> D(1), R(2), A(3), F(4), T(5) -> A in position 3? Invalid.

 ""focal"" -> contains C? excluded.

 ""latch"" -> L(1), A(2), T(3), C(4), H(5) -> C excluded? yes.

 It's tricky.

 Another word with A at position 4: ""ultra"" -> 
   U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5) -> but R is excluded? We got R: x in the first guess.

 So we can't use R.

 Put A at position 5: 
   ""mania"" -> repeated A? and also contains N? which is excluded.

 ""scuba"" -> S(1), C(2), U(3), B(4), A(5) -> contains C? excluded.

 ""vodka"" -> V(1), O(2), D(3), K(4), A(5) -> avoids excluded letters? 
   Check: excluded are C,R,N,E -> V,O,D,K,A (A is allowed) -> V,O,D,K are new.

 But we know A is present, so we must include A anyway? Yes, but we are putting A at position 5.

 Alternatively, ""tidal"": 
   T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5) -> A at position 4? 
   But ""tidal"" has L at the end? Yes.

 Now we test A at position 4.

 Similarly, ""viral"" -> but contains R? excluded.

 So ""tidal"": 
   Letters: T, I, D, A, L -> avoids excluded letters? 
   T, I, D, A, L -> none of them are C,R,N,E? Good.

 But note: we tested A in position 4? 

 However, ""tidal"" uses T, I, D, A, L.

 Another alternative: ""staid"": 
   S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5) -> but A is in position 3? which we know is not allowed.

 Therefore, for guess 2:

 Option 1: ""TIDAL"" (with A at 4) 
   -> T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5)

 Option 2: ""BASIL"" (with A at 2) 
   -> B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), L(5)

 Both introduce common letters.

 Considering letter frequency: 
   T is very common, S is very common, L and I are common too.

 So both words are good. 

 However, note that we also want to test letters that might be in the word. Since the first guess only gave us one letter (A) present, we have four more to find.

 We decide: Let's go with ""tidal"" because it places A in a position we haven't tested (position 4). The previous guess had A in position 3? We know that was wrong, so testing A in position 4 might be better than position 2? 

 Actually, testing the same letter in a different position is good if that position is likely.

 But we don't have much information, so it's arbitrary.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that also tests vowels that we haven't checked? 

 We know E is out? So vowels remaining: A is already known. Then: I, O, U? 

 We haven't tested O or U? But I is in both ""tidal"" and ""basil"".

 How about ""audio""? 
   - A(1), U(2), D(3), I(4), O(5) 
   - Avoids exclusions? 
   - But we know A is present, and we put it in position 1? 
   - Also, we test U, D, I, O.

 And all distinct letters? Yes.

 Also, we avoid the excluded letters: no C,R,N,E.

 Let's consider ""audio"":
   - Tests A at position 1? 
   - Tests U, D, I, O.

 Since we know A is in the word, putting it at position 1 might give us more information? 

 Then let's compare:

 Option 3: ""AUDIO"" -> which is a classical starting word? 

 But we already made one guess.

 ""AUDIO"" has A at position 1: might be correct? Or it might not.

 Now, comparing the choices:

 - ""AUDIO"": 
     Letters: A, U, D, I, O -> tests vowels and D? And positions: we haven't seen position 1? 

 - ""BASIL"": 
     Letters: B,A,S,I,L -> consonants B,S,L and vowels A,I.

 - ""TIDAL"": 
     Letters: T,I,D,A,L -> similar to AUDIO? But T/L instead of U/O.

 Actually, ""tidal"" has T and D? So quite different.

 Since we are more in the dark? But we have the constraint on A: it cannot be in position 3.

 So ""audio"": 
   Positions: A(1), U(2), D(3), I(4), O(5)

 Let me see if ""audio"" is a valid word? Yes.

 It tests:
   A in position 1 (was previously tested in position 3 and was wrong? Now we test if it is in position 1).
   Plus we test U,D,I,O.

 The feedback might be very informative.

 But note: if A is not in position 1, then we get a '-' for A? Then we know A must be in position 4 or 5? (or 2? but we put U at 2) 

 Actually, we test position 1 for A? If it's not correct, then A must be in one of the positions: 2,4,5? 

 But wait, in the word ""audio"", the positions: 
   If A is in the secret word but not in position 1, then it must be in position 2? But we put U at 2. Or in position 4? We have I at 4? Or position 5? We have O at 5. 

 Since the letters in positions 2,4,5 are all unique? Yes, so if A is in the word but not at 1, then it might show as in position 2? but actually we have U at 2, etc. 

 Actually: the feedback will tell us if A is present? We already know it's in the word, so the feedback symbol for A will be either:
   - ✓ if it is in the correct position? Then position 1 is green.
   - - if it is in the word but in a different position? Then we know A is not in position 1.

 Similarly, for other letters.

 So I think ""audio"" is a good guess for the second attempt.

 But note: we are testing only one vowel? Actually, we test A,U,I,O? Quite vowel-heavy? But vowels are important.

 However, the secret word might have only one vowel? But A is already one, and we are testing two more? 

 Given that five-letter words usually have several vowels, it's okay.

 Alternatively, we can use ""tidal"" to test T and D? 

 Considering frequency of letters? We have excluded E, which is very frequent. Then T is the most frequent letter? 

 So testing T might be important.

 Therefore, let me propose:

 Option 4: ""TOAST"" -> but repeated T? and A at position 3? Not allowed.

 How about ""LASTS""? -> repeated S? and A at position 2? But we haven't tested S,L? 

 But ""lasts"" has repeated S: not ideal.

 Then, let's choose ""tidal"" or ""audio""?

 Since T is so common, maybe ""tidal"" is better? 

 But ""tidal"" also introduces T? 

 Actually, both ""audio"" and ""tidal"" have distinct letters, so they are equally good? 

 Let me choose ""audio"": 
   Why? Because it tests multiple vowels. Since the word contains A, which is a vowel, it might have other vowels? 

 And if ""audio"" doesn't give us any additional letters? Then we know that U,D,I,O are absent? 

 But also, we get positional information.

 Alternatively, I found ""paint"": 
   P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> contains N? Excluded -> invalid.

 ""light"": doesn't have A? We must include A because we know it's present? Otherwise we waste? 

 Yes, we know A is in the word? So if we don't include A in the guess, we won't get feedback about its position? 

 And we still need to locate A.

 Therefore, we must include A.

 So back to including A: words like ""audio"", ""basil"", ""tidal"", ""habit"", etc.

 I'll go with ""audio"".<thinking>
The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" provided critical information:
- C, R, N, and E are not in the word at all (marked ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in the third position (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Since A must be present, it should be included but not in position 3.
- Avoid C, R, N, E entirely, as they have been eliminated.
- Test new common letters to maximize information gain, prioritizing other vowels and consonants.
- Position A in a different spot—position 1, 2, 4, or 5—to narrow down its location.

Considering words that meet these criteria:
- ""AUDIO"" is a strong candidate: 
  - Includes A (position 1), avoiding position 3.
  - Avoids C, R, N, E.
  - Tests three new vowels (U, I, O) and one consonant (D), which are common and could reveal additional vowels or positional data.
  - All distinct letters minimize redundancy.

Other options like ""BASIL"" (A in position 2) or ""TIDAL"" (A in position 4) are also valid, but ""AUDIO"" efficiently tests multiple new vowels at once, leveraging the elimination of E to prioritize less frequent vowels (U, I, O). This could provide quick insights into vowel placement and frequency.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,SHOAL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters to maximize information.
 A good starting word usually has common letters (like vowels and frequent consonants) and no repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AUDIO"", etc.

 Let me choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
   S: common consonant
   L: common consonant
   A: common vowel
   T: common consonant
   E: common vowel

 This gives us a good spread of common letters.

 So, for the first guess, we'll guess: SLATE<thinking>
For the first guess with no prior information, I need a word that maximizes the information gained about the secret word. A good starting word should:
- Contain common letters to increase the chance of hitting correct letters
- Include a mix of vowels and common consonants
- Avoid repeated letters to cover more possibilities

Words like ""SLATE"" are strong openers because they include:
- Vowels: A and E
- Common consonants: S, L, T
- All unique letters

""CRANE"" is another excellent choice for similar reasons. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- C and R are very common consonants
- A and E are top vowels
- N is also relatively frequent

This combination should provide meaningful feedback across multiple letter positions while testing common English patterns.
</thinking>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position.
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Since A is present but not in position 3, it must be in one of the other positions: 1,2,4, or 5.

 For our second guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
 - Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word)
 - Does not include C, R, N, E (since they are confirmed absent)
 - We should avoid repeating letters if possible to maximize information.

 Also, since A is not in position 3, we should place A in a different position (1,2,4, or 5).

 Ideas for second guess:
 - We want a word that includes A and other common letters not excluded. Excluded letters: C,R,N,E.

 Common letters in English include: S,T,L,I,O,B,D,G,H,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y etc.

 Let's think of words that contain A, and avoid C,R,N,E.

 Possible words:
 - ""salad"" -> but repeated letters (A twice) - maybe not optimal
 - ""salsa"" -> repeated S and A, and only 4 letters? No, S A L S A -> not 5 distinct, and repeated letters might not give as much information.
 - ""plate"" -> contains E -> excluded
 - ""blast"" -> avoid: has S,T,L,B,A -> let's check: B,L,A,S,T. This avoids the excluded letters.

 Word: ""blast""
   Positions: B(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)

 However, note that in the previous feedback, A was not in position 3. But here we put A in position 3? That would be against the feedback?
 Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot place A in position 3 again.

 Therefore, we must put A in a position that isn't 3.

 Alternative words:

 Let's try to put A in position 1: 
   Example: ""adios"" -> contains D,I,O,S. But we don't know if D,I,O,S are safe? 
   But note: we want to test new letters.

 However, ""adios"" contains S and O, which are common.

 Another idea: ""about"" -> contains B,O,U,T. But we don't know about these letters.

 How about ""stamp""? 
   - S,T,A,M,P. 
   - A is in position 3? -> but we know A is not in position 3. So we cannot put A in position 3 again.
   So move A to a different position.

 We can try ""patsy"": 
   - P(1), A(2), T(3), S(4), Y(5) -> A is in position 2.

 Avoid any word that has A in position 3.

 Also, avoid C,R,N,E.

 Another good candidate: ""aisle"" -> contains E? Yes -> excluded.

 Avoid E.

 So, let's try ""salty"": 
   - S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5): 
   A is in position 2 -> good because it was not in position 3 and we avoid placing it in 3.

 But note: we don't know if S,L,T,Y are in the word? We want to test.

 Another: ""valid"": contains V,A,L,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E. 
   Positions: V(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), D(5) -> A in position 2.

 However, note that we haven't tested T,S,H,O,M,P etc.

 Since we excluded four letters (C,R,N,E) and know A is one letter, we have 21 letters left? Actually, 26-5=21 letters available.

 We need to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Considering commonality: T is very frequent, S is frequent, etc.

 So words like ""taffy"" -> repeated F, bad. 

 How about ""bails""? 
   B(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> A in position 2, avoids E, avoids C,R,N, and introduces B,I,L,S.

 Also, we are testing 4 new letters: B,I,L,S.

 However, note position 3: I? We have no information about that.

 Alternatively, ""daisy"": 
   D(1),A(2),I(3),S(4),Y(5) -> similar, introduces D,I,S,Y and A.

 Both seem okay.

 But note: we must avoid E? yes. Both avoid.

 Another idea: ""basil"" -> 
   B(1),A(2),S(3),I(4),L(5) -> again A in position 2.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word might have an A in position 1,2,4,5.

 We need to test positions differently? 

 Since we know A is present and not in position 3, testing it in position 2 (for example) will help us determine if that's its spot or not.

 Alternatively, we might avoid position 2 as well? Not necessary, because we don't have a reason to avoid position 2. The previous feedback didn't rule out any position for A except position 3.

 So, let's go with a word that has A in a new position (like 2) and tests many common letters.

 ""BASAL"" -> repeated A, avoid.

 ""BASIL"": 
   Letters: B, A, S, I, L -> all distinct. And A in position 2? Actually, in ""basil"" the positions are:
   B-A-S-I-L? Wait, no: 
   Position 1: B
   Position 2: A
   Position 3: S
   Position 4: I
   Position 5: L

 But wait, the word ""basil"" is 5 letters? Yes.

 However, note that ""salad"" has two A's and we avoid repeated to get more information. So ""basil"" with distinct letters is better.

 Alternatively, ""habit"": 
   H(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), T(5) -> A in position 2. 

 Or ""macho"" -> but wait, M,A,C,H,O -> C is excluded? Yes! We cannot use C because it's excluded.

 So ""habit"": contains H,A,B,I,T -> avoids the excluded letters.

 Similarly, ""gawky"": G,A,W,K,Y -> avoids exclusions, but not very common? 

 We should aim for words that use common consonants and vowels.

 Another choice: ""pastel"" -> contains E -> excluded.

 So between ""basil"", ""bails"", ""daisy"", ""habit"", etc.

 I think ""habit"" is good because it uses T and H, which are common. 
 And it places A in position 2? But maybe the secret word has A in position 1,4,5? 

 Actually, we are testing position 2: if we put A in position 2 and it is correct, then we know. If not, then we know A is not in position 2 either? 

 Alternatively, we could test A in a different position to get more coverage? 

 For example, testing A in position 1 or 4 or 5. 

 Let me try to get A not in position 2 or 3.

 How about ""piano"" -> contains O, but also A in position 3? -> but we cannot place A in position 3.

 ""piano"" has A at position 3 -> invalid because we know A isn't in position 3.

 So words with A at positions 1,2,4,5.

 Position 1: ""adult"", ""abyss"", etc... but ""abyss"" has repeated S? So not distinct.

 Similarly, ""agile"" -> contains E? excluded.

 ""daily"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> A in position 2? Wait: 
   D(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5) -> A in position 2.

 Same as before.

 How about putting A in position 4? 
   Example: ""spade"" -> contains E? excluded.

 Without E: ""draft"" -> D(1), R(2), A(3), F(4), T(5) -> A in position 3? Invalid.

 ""focal"" -> contains C? excluded.

 ""latch"" -> L(1), A(2), T(3), C(4), H(5) -> C excluded? yes.

 It's tricky.

 Another word with A at position 4: ""ultra"" -> 
   U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5) -> but R is excluded? We got R: x in the first guess.

 So we can't use R.

 Put A at position 5: 
   ""mania"" -> repeated A? and also contains N? which is excluded.

 ""scuba"" -> S(1), C(2), U(3), B(4), A(5) -> contains C? excluded.

 ""vodka"" -> V(1), O(2), D(3), K(4), A(5) -> avoids excluded letters? 
   Check: excluded are C,R,N,E -> V,O,D,K,A (A is allowed) -> V,O,D,K are new.

 But we know A is present, so we must include A anyway? Yes, but we are putting A at position 5.

 Alternatively, ""tidal"": 
   T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5) -> A at position 4? 
   But ""tidal"" has L at the end? Yes.

 Now we test A at position 4.

 Similarly, ""viral"" -> but contains R? excluded.

 So ""tidal"": 
   Letters: T, I, D, A, L -> avoids excluded letters? 
   T, I, D, A, L -> none of them are C,R,N,E? Good.

 But note: we tested A in position 4? 

 However, ""tidal"" uses T, I, D, A, L.

 Another alternative: ""staid"": 
   S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5) -> but A is in position 3? which we know is not allowed.

 Therefore, for guess 2:

 Option 1: ""TIDAL"" (with A at 4) 
   -> T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5)

 Option 2: ""BASIL"" (with A at 2) 
   -> B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), L(5)

 Both introduce common letters.

 Considering letter frequency: 
   T is very common, S is very common, L and I are common too.

 So both words are good. 

 However, note that we also want to test letters that might be in the word. Since the first guess only gave us one letter (A) present, we have four more to find.

 We decide: Let's go with ""tidal"" because it places A in a position we haven't tested (position 4). The previous guess had A in position 3? We know that was wrong, so testing A in position 4 might be better than position 2? 

 Actually, testing the same letter in a different position is good if that position is likely.

 But we don't have much information, so it's arbitrary.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that also tests vowels that we haven't checked? 

 We know E is out? So vowels remaining: A is already known. Then: I, O, U? 

 We haven't tested O or U? But I is in both ""tidal"" and ""basil"".

 How about ""audio""? 
   - A(1), U(2), D(3), I(4), O(5) 
   - Avoids exclusions? 
   - But we know A is present, and we put it in position 1? 
   - Also, we test U, D, I, O.

 And all distinct letters? Yes.

 Also, we avoid the excluded letters: no C,R,N,E.

 Let's consider ""audio"":
   - Tests A at position 1? 
   - Tests U, D, I, O.

 Since we know A is in the word, putting it at position 1 might give us more information? 

 Then let's compare:

 Option 3: ""AUDIO"" -> which is a classical starting word? 

 But we already made one guess.

 ""AUDIO"" has A at position 1: might be correct? Or it might not.

 Now, comparing the choices:

 - ""AUDIO"": 
     Letters: A, U, D, I, O -> tests vowels and D? And positions: we haven't seen position 1? 

 - ""BASIL"": 
     Letters: B,A,S,I,L -> consonants B,S,L and vowels A,I.

 - ""TIDAL"": 
     Letters: T,I,D,A,L -> similar to AUDIO? But T/L instead of U/O.

 Actually, ""tidal"" has T and D? So quite different.

 Since we are more in the dark? But we have the constraint on A: it cannot be in position 3.

 So ""audio"": 
   Positions: A(1), U(2), D(3), I(4), O(5)

 Let me see if ""audio"" is a valid word? Yes.

 It tests:
   A in position 1 (was previously tested in position 3 and was wrong? Now we test if it is in position 1).
   Plus we test U,D,I,O.

 The feedback might be very informative.

 But note: if A is not in position 1, then we get a '-' for A? Then we know A must be in position 4 or 5? (or 2? but we put U at 2) 

 Actually, we test position 1 for A? If it's not correct, then A must be in one of the positions: 2,4,5? 

 But wait, in the word ""audio"", the positions: 
   If A is in the secret word but not in position 1, then it must be in position 2? But we put U at 2. Or in position 4? We have I at 4? Or position 5? We have O at 5. 

 Since the letters in positions 2,4,5 are all unique? Yes, so if A is in the word but not at 1, then it might show as in position 2? but actually we have U at 2, etc. 

 Actually: the feedback will tell us if A is present? We already know it's in the word, so the feedback symbol for A will be either:
   - ✓ if it is in the correct position? Then position 1 is green.
   - - if it is in the word but in a different position? Then we know A is not in position 1.

 Similarly, for other letters.

 So I think ""audio"" is a good guess for the second attempt.

 But note: we are testing only one vowel? Actually, we test A,U,I,O? Quite vowel-heavy? But vowels are important.

 However, the secret word might have only one vowel? But A is already one, and we are testing two more? 

 Given that five-letter words usually have several vowels, it's okay.

 Alternatively, we can use ""tidal"" to test T and D? 

 Considering frequency of letters? We have excluded E, which is very frequent. Then T is the most frequent letter? 

 So testing T might be important.

 Therefore, let me propose:

 Option 4: ""TOAST"" -> but repeated T? and A at position 3? Not allowed.

 How about ""LASTS""? -> repeated S? and A at position 2? But we haven't tested S,L? 

 But ""lasts"" has repeated S: not ideal.

 Then, let's choose ""tidal"" or ""audio""?

 Since T is so common, maybe ""tidal"" is better? 

 But ""tidal"" also introduces T? 

 Actually, both ""audio"" and ""tidal"" have distinct letters, so they are equally good? 

 Let me choose ""audio"": 
   Why? Because it tests multiple vowels. Since the word contains A, which is a vowel, it might have other vowels? 

 And if ""audio"" doesn't give us any additional letters? Then we know that U,D,I,O are absent? 

 But also, we get positional information.

 Alternatively, I found ""paint"": 
   P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> contains N? Excluded -> invalid.

 ""light"": doesn't have A? We must include A because we know it's present? Otherwise we waste? 

 Yes, we know A is in the word? So if we don't include A in the guess, we won't get feedback about its position? 

 And we still need to locate A.

 Therefore, we must include A.

 So back to including A: words like ""audio"", ""basil"", ""tidal"", ""habit"", etc.

 I'll go with ""audio"".<thinking>
The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" provided critical information:
- C, R, N, and E are not in the word at all (marked ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in the third position (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Since A must be present, it should be included but not in position 3.
- Avoid C, R, N, E entirely, as they have been eliminated.
- Test new common letters to maximize information gain, prioritizing other vowels and consonants.
- Position A in a different spot—position 1, 2, 4, or 5—to narrow down its location.

Considering words that meet these criteria:
- ""AUDIO"" is a strong candidate: 
  - Includes A (position 1), avoiding position 3.
  - Avoids C, R, N, E.
  - Tests three new vowels (U, I, O) and one consonant (D), which are common and could reveal additional vowels or positional data.
  - All distinct letters minimize redundancy.

Other options like ""BASIL"" (A in position 2) or ""TIDAL"" (A in position 4) are also valid, but ""AUDIO"" efficiently tests multiple new vowels at once, leveraging the elimination of E to prioritize less frequent vowels (U, I, O). This could provide quick insights into vowel placement and frequency.

But here we put A in position 3? That would be against the feedback?\n Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot place A in position 3 again.\n\n Therefore, we must put A in a position that isn\'t 3.\n\n Alternative words:\n\n Let\'s try to put A in position 1: \n   Example: ""adios"" -> contains D,I,O,S. But we don\'t know if D,I,O,S are safe? \n   But note: we want to test new letters.\n\n However, ""adios"" contains S and O, which are common.\n\n Another idea: ""about"" -> contains B,O,U,T. But we don\'t know about these letters.\n\n How about ""stamp""? \n   - S,T,A,M,P. \n   - A is in position 3? -> but we know A is not in position 3. So we cannot put A in position 3 again.\n   So move A to a different position.\n\n We can try ""patsy"": \n   - P(1), A(2), T(3), S(4), Y(5) -> A is in position 2.\n\n Avoid any word that has A in position 3.\n\n Also, avoid C,R,N,E.\n\n Another good candidate: ""aisle"" -> contains E? Yes -> excluded.\n\n Avoid E.\n\n So, let\'s try ""salty"": \n   - S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5): \n   A is in position 2 -> good because it was not in position 3 and we avoid placing it in 3.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if S,L,T,Y are in the word? We want to test.\n\n Another: ""valid"": contains V,A,L,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E. \n   Positions: V(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), D(5) -> A in position 2.\n\n However, note that we haven\'t tested T,S,H,O,M,P etc.\n\n Since we excluded four letters (C,R,N,E) and know A is one letter, we have 21 letters left? Actually, 26-5=21 letters available.\n\n We need to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n Considering commonality: T is very frequent, S is frequent, etc.\n\n So words like ""taffy"" -> repeated F, bad. \n\n How about ""bails""? \n   B(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> A in position 2, avoids E, avoids C,R,N, and introduces B,I,L,S.\n\n Also, we are testing 4 new letters: B,I,L,S.\n\n However, note position 3: I? We have no information about that.\n\n Alternatively, ""daisy"": \n   D(1),A(2),I(3),S(4),Y(5) -> similar, introduces D,I,S,Y and A.\n\n Both seem okay.\n\n But note: we must avoid E? yes. Both avoid.\n\n Another idea: ""basil"" -> \n   B(1),A(2),S(3),I(4),L(5) -> again A in position 2.\n\n However, we have to consider that the secret word might have an A in position 1,2,4,5.\n\n We need to test positions differently? \n\n Since we know A is present and not in position 3, testing it in position 2 (for example) will help us determine if that\'s its spot or not.\n\n Alternatively, we might avoid position 2 as well? Not necessary, because we don\'t have a reason to avoid position 2. The previous feedback didn\'t rule out any position for A except position 3.\n\n So, let\'s go with a word that has A in a new position (like 2) and tests many common letters.\n\n ""BASAL"" -> repeated A, avoid.\n\n ""BASIL"": \n   Letters: B, A, S, I, L -> all distinct. And A in position 2? Actually, in ""basil"" the positions are:\n   B-A-S-I-L? Wait, no: \n   Position 1: B\n   Position 2: A\n   Position 3: S\n   Position 4: I\n   Position 5: L\n\n But wait, the word ""basil"" is 5 letters?

So ""basil"" with distinct letters is better.\n\n Alternatively, ""habit"": \n   H(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), T(5) -> A in position 2. \n\n Or ""macho"" -> but wait, M,A,C,H,O -> C is excluded? Yes! We cannot use C because it\'s excluded.\n\n So ""habit"": contains H,A,B,I,T -> avoids the excluded letters.\n\n Similarly, ""gawky"": G,A,W,K,Y -> avoids exclusions, but not very common? \n\n We should aim for words that use common consonants and vowels.\n\n Another choice: ""pastel"" -> contains E -> excluded.\n\n So between ""basil"", ""bails"", ""daisy"", ""habit"", etc.\n\n I think ""habit"" is good because it uses T and H, which are common. \n And it places A in position 2? But maybe the secret word has A in position 1,4,5? \n\n Actually, we are testing position 2: if we put A in position 2 and it is correct, then we know. If not, then we know A is not in position 2 either? \n\n Alternatively, we could test A in a different position to get more coverage? \n\n For example, testing A in position 1 or 4 or 5. \n\n Let me try to get A not in position 2 or 3.\n\n How about ""piano"" -> contains O, but also A in position 3? -> but we cannot place A in position 3.\n\n ""piano"" has A at position 3 -> invalid because we know A isn\'t in position 3.\n\n So words with A at positions 1,2,4,5.\n\n Position 1: ""adult"", ""abyss"", etc... but ""abyss"" has repeated S? So not distinct.\n\n Similarly, ""agile"" -> contains E? excluded.\n\n ""daily"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> A in position 2? Wait: \n   D(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5) -> A in position 2.\n\n Same as before.\n\n How about putting A in position 4? \n   Example: ""spade"" -> contains E? excluded.\n\n Without E: ""draft"" -> D(1), R(2), A(3), F(4), T(5) -> A in position 3? Invalid.\n\n ""focal"" -> contains C? excluded.\n\n ""latch"" -> L(1), A(2), T(3), C(4), H(5) -> C excluded? yes.\n\n It\'s tricky.\n\n Another word with A at position 4: ""ultra"" -> \n   U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5) -> but R is excluded? We got R: x in the first guess.\n\n So we can\'t use R.\n\n Put A at position 5: \n   ""mania"" -> repeated A? and also contains N? which is excluded.\n\n ""scuba"" -> S(1), C(2), U(3), B(4), A(5) -> contains C? excluded.\n\n ""vodka"" -> V(1), O(2), D(3), K(4), A(5) -> avoids excluded letters? \n   Check: excluded are C,R,N,E -> V,O,D,K,A (A is allowed) -> V,O,D,K are new.\n\n But we know A is present, so we must include A anyway? Yes, but we are putting A at position 5.\n\n Alternatively, ""tidal"": \n   T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5) -> A at position 4? \n   But ""tidal"" has L at the end? Yes.\n\n Now we test A at position 4.\n\n Similarly, ""viral"" -> but contains R? excluded.\n\n So ""tidal"": \n   Letters: T, I, D, A, L -> avoids excluded letters? \n   T, I, D, A, L -> none of them are C,R,N,E? Good.\n\n But note: we tested A in position 4? \n\n However, ""tidal"" uses T, I, D, A, L.\n\n Another alternative: ""staid"": \n   S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5) -> but A is in position 3? which we know is not allowed.\n\n Therefore, for guess 2:\n\n Option 1: ""TIDAL"" (with A at 4) \n   -> T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5)\n\n Option 2: ""BASIL"" (with A at 2) \n   -> B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), L(5)\n\n Both introduce common letters.\n\n Considering letter frequency: \n   T is very common, S is very common, L and I are common too.\n\n So both words are good. \n\n However, note that we also want to test letters that might be in the word. Since the first guess only gave us one letter (A) present, we have four more to find.\n\n We decide: Let\'s go with ""tidal"" because it places A in a position we haven\'t tested (position 4). The previous guess had A in position 3? We know that was wrong, so testing A in position 4 might be better than position 2? \n\n Actually, testing the same letter in a different position is good if that position is likely.\n\n But we don\'t have much information, so it\'s arbitrary.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that also tests vowels that we haven\'t checked? \n\n We know E is out? So vowels remaining: A is already known. Then: I, O, U? \n\n We haven\'t tested O or U? But I is in both ""tidal"" and ""basil"".\n\n How about ""audio""? \n   - A(1), U(2), D(3), I(4), O(5) \n   - Avoids exclusions? \n   - But we know A is present, and we put it in position 1? \n   - Also, we test U, D, I, O.\n\n And all distinct letters? Yes.\n\n Also, we avoid the excluded letters: no C,R,N,E.\n\n Let\'s consider ""audio"":\n   - Tests A at position 1? \n   - Tests U, D, I, O.\n\n Since we know A is in the word, putting it at position 1 might give us more information? \n\n Then let\'s compare:\n\n Option 3: ""AUDIO"" -> which is a classical starting word? \n\n But we already made one guess.\n\n ""AUDIO"" has A at position 1: might be correct? Or it might not.\n\n Now, comparing the choices:\n\n - ""AUDIO"": \n     Letters: A, U, D, I, O -> tests vowels and D? And positions: we haven\'t seen position 1? \n\n - ""BASIL"": \n     Letters: B,A,S,I,L -> consonants B,S,L and vowels A,I.\n\n - ""TIDAL"": \n     Letters: T,I,D,A,L -> similar to AUDIO? But T/L instead of U/O.\n\n Actually, ""tidal"" has T and D? So quite different.\n\n Since we are more in the dark? But we have the constraint on A: it cannot be in position 3.\n\n So ""audio"": \n   Positions: A(1), U(2), D(3), I(4), O(5)\n\n Let me see if ""audio"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n It tests:\n   A in position 1 (was previously tested in position 3 and was wrong? Now we test if it is in position 1).\n   Plus we test U,D,I,O.\n\n The feedback might be very informative.\n\n But note: if A is not in position 1, then we get a \'-\' for A? Then we know A must be in position 4 or 5? (or 2? but we put U at 2) \n\n Actually, we test position 1 for A? If it\'s not correct, then A must be in one of the positions: 2,4,5? \n\n But wait, in the word ""audio"", the positions: \n   If A is in the secret word but not in position 1, then it must be in position 2?

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 (since it was placed at position 1 in this guess) and not in position 3 (from previous). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5? But note, in ""audio"", A was in position 1 and we got a dash (-), meaning it's in the word but not at position 1. Similarly, O was given a dash, meaning O is in the word but not in position 5 (since we put O at position 5 in this guess) and not in position 4? Actually, for O: since we put it at position 5 and got a dash, it means O is in the word but not in position 5. Also, U and D and I are not in the word? Because they are marked x.

Additionally:
- U is not in the word.
- D is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 5.

So now we know:
- Letters in the word: A and O? And we know two letters: A and O? But there could be more? Actually, we know A and O are present? And others? But we haven't found all.

Also, from guess 1: we only knew A? Then guess 2: O is added? And we eliminated U,D,I.

So now we have:
- Present letters: A and O.
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I. (so far 7 letters excluded: C,R,N,E,U,D,I)

The word has 5 letters? So we have two known letters: A and O? And three unknown.

But note: O is only said to be present? And A is present? We don't know where.

We also know:
- For A: it is not in position 1 (from audio) and not in position 3 (from crane). Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5? Actually, positions: 
    - In crane: A was tested at position 3? So avoid position 3.
    - In audio: A was tested at position 1? So avoid position 1.
    Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, for O: it is tested only in position 5 (in audio) and given dash? Meaning O is in the word? But not in position 5. 
We haven't tested O at other positions? So O can be in any position except 5? And except where? We don't know? So O can be in position 1,2,3, or 4? But note: we have the positions: 

Now, we know O is in the word? But not in position 5. 

But what positions are possible for O?
- We haven't tested O elsewhere? So no other constraints? So O can be in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

But note: if O were in position 1, and we put A in position 1 in audio, why didn't we get O in position 1? We put U in position 2? Etc.? Actually, the feedback symbols: we got A at position 1: (-) meaning A is in the word but not at position 1? And O at position 5: (-) meaning O is in the word but not at position 5? And U,D,I: absent.

So we need to include both A and O in our next guess? And avoid excluded letters: C,R,N,E,U,D,I? And avoid placing A in positions 1 and 3? And avoid O in position 5.

Therefore, our next guess must:
- Include A and O? (since we know they are in the word? Yes? But are there more? We don't know? We have two confirmed letters? The word might have duplicates? But for now, we assume distinct? Because? Well, we haven't seen duplicates? But possible? But we can avoid duplicate letters? Actually, better to use distinct letters? So we include A and O? And we include three new letters? 

But note: could the word have letters that we haven't guessed? Yes? So we have to consider.

Now, positions:
We must place A in position 2, 4, or 5? And O in position 1,2,3, or 4? But avoid placing O in position 5? Already excluded.

Also, note that O and A might not be duplicates? So we cannot place them at the same position? (unless duplicates? but we avoid).

Therefore, we have to choose positions for A and O? But also? We don't know the other letters? So we need to test new letters.

Now, the word must? Have 5 letters? Two known? So three unknowns? 

So potential word: we are guessing a word that has A and O? And avoid excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,N,E,U,D,I? So available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z, and we already have A and O? But we need to use three more?

Let's also recall: frequent English consonants: L,S,T,B,P,M, etc.

We can try to form words that include A and O? And assign A to one of the positions: 2,4,5? And O to one of positions 1,2,3,4? And not overlapping? Unless duplicates? 

Since no duplication? Then assign distinct positions.

Possible placements:

If A is in position 2? Then O cannot be in 2? So O in 1,3,4? 

Similarly, A in position 4: O in 1,2,3? 
A in position 5: O in 1,2,3,4.

And we don't know which? So we need to choose one.

But also? We want to test common letters? And avoid losing try? 

So let me think of common words? 

Example: ""LOCAL""? -> contains C? Excluded? C is excluded? So invalid.

""BOOST""? -> contains O twice? and E? E excluded? But also? Has E? No? Boost: B,O,O,S,T? Not distinct? And has repeated O? And no A? Must have A.

So must include A? 

""ABOUT""? -> contains U? Excluded? U is excluded? From audio feedback? We know U is not in word? So avoid.

""MANGO"": contains M,A,N,G,O? But N excluded? N is excluded? So invalid.

""SOLAR"": contains S,O,L,A,R? But R excluded? So invalid.

""PLAIN"": contains L,A,I,N? But I and N excluded? Invalid.

So hard? 

How about ""POLKA""? -> P,O,L,K,A? 
Letters: P,O,L,K,A? Avoids C,R,N,E,U,D,I? Yes? And positions: 
Position 1: P
Position 2: O
Position 3: L
Position 4: K
Position 5: A

Now, check for A: A is in position 5? Which is allowed? Because A can be in 2,4,5? So 5 is allowed.
O is in position 2? Which is one of the positions? And not position 5? So O is fine? But wait, O not in position 5? Yes? And we have assigned O to 2? 

But know? We must check: 
Is it possible that O could be in position 1? We haven't tested? But in ""audio"", we only tested O at position 5? So no? 

Similarly, for A: in position 5? Which is one of the possibilities? 

But wait: the secret word could have O in position 1? And we put O at position 2? Then we would get a dash? And similarly, A at 5? 

With ""polka"": 
   Position: P(1), O(2), L(3), K(4), A(5)

But we have constraints? 
For O: it is not in position 5? But here we put it at 2? Which is fine? Perhaps.
And for A: not in 1 or 3? So at 5? Is allowed? 

But note: what is the word? ""POLKA""? Is it a valid word? Yes? It means dance.

We introduce P,O,L,K,A? All distinct? And avoid excluded letters? Yes? 

So let's use that.

But note: we are testing positions? But could we get information? Yes? 

If we get:
   If O is actually in position 2? Then we get O(✓)? But we don't know?
   Similarly, if A is actually in position 5? Then A(✓)? 

But the word might not be POLKA? But we are choosing a guess to get feedback? 

Alternatively, we could arrange the positions differently? For example, putting O at position 1? And A at position 4? 

Then word: ""OASIS""? -> repeated S? and doesn't avoid? But O(1),A(2),S(3)...? But S? Then I? Excluded? Invalid.

""OSCAR""? -> contains C? Excluded.

""JOKER""? -> contains E and R? Excluded.

So ""POLKA"" seems good? 

But note: we have to include both A and O? And avoid constraints.

Another word: ""GLOAT""? 
   G,L,O,A,T? 
   Positions: 
      Position 1: G
      Position 2: L
      Position 3: O? 
      Position 4: A
      Position 5: T

Now, for A: we place at position 4? Which is allowed? And O at position 3? 
For O: position 3 has not been tested? So it's possible? But we must avoid for A? A is at position 4? Which is fine? 
And O: O at position 3? 
But we put O at position 3? And we haven't tested O at position 3 before? So we don't know? 

But the word: G,L,O,A,T? Avoids exclusions? G,L,O,A,T -> no excluded letter? 

Similarly good? 

But ""gloat""? 

Alternatively, ""SPLAT""? 
   S,P,L,A,T? 
   Positions: 
      S(1), P(2), L(3), A(4), T(5)? 
   Then A at position 4? 
   But no O? We must include O? Because we know O is in the word? If we don't include O, we don't get feedback for O's position? And we waste a guess? 

So we must include O? So ""SPLAT"" doesn't include O? 

Therefore, invalid? 

We require the word to contain both A and O? 

So words like ""POLKA"" or ""GLOAT""? Or ""CLOAK""? But ""cloak"" has C? Excluded.

So:

""POLKA"": P,O,L,K,A -> positions: O at 2, A at 5? 
""GLOAT"": G,L,O,A,T -> positions: O at 3, A at 4? 

Which one to choose? 

In ""POLKA"":
   O is at position 2? Which we haven't tested? 
   A is at position 5? Which we haven't tested? 

In ""GLOAT"":
   O is at position 3? 
   A is at position 4? 

What were previously restricted for A? 
   A: not at 1 or 3? Because: 
      In crane: A not at position 3? 
      In audio: A not at position 1? 
   So for A? Positions 2,4,5? 
   Position 3? Already tested and not? 

Similarly, O has been tested only at position 5? Which we know not? So O can be at 1,2,3,4.

In ""POLKA"": 
   O at 2? And A at 5? So we test two positions: 
      O at position 2: if correct? ✓? Otherwise? 
      Also? We test new letters P,L,K? 

Similarly? In ""GLOAT"": 
   O at 3? A at 4? Test G,L,T? 

But note: we have also? Frequency? T is more frequent than K? 

How about ""PASTA""? 
   P,A,S,T,A? Repeated A? Not good? 
   But also? Avoid O? Must include O.

Given that? 

I think either POLKA or GLOAT is fine? 

But let me think? We can choose GLOAT? because it puts A in position 4 and O in position 3? 

Wait? Position 3? We tested A at position 3? But not O? So O might be at position 3? 

Similarly? In POLKA? We put O at position 2? Which might be correct? 

Arbitrary? Then let's pick GLOAT? 

But try? 

Alternatively? ""SHOAL""? 
   S,H,O,A,L? 
   Positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), A(4), L(5)? 
   Then avoid? 
   Letters: S,H,O,A,L -> avoids exclusions? 
   O at position 3? A at position 4? 

And we introduce S,H,L? 

Another: ""FLORA""? But R excluded? 

""BLOKA"": maybe not a word? 

So let me choose ""SHOAL""? 

SHOAL: S at position 1? But we haven't tested S? 

Or GLOAT: G,L,O,A,T -> O at 3? A at 4.

To decide? Note? In ""audio"" we tried U (position 2) and D (position 3) and I (position 4) and got x? So we know position 2 doesn't have U? Position 3 doesn't have D? Position 4 doesn't have I? 

But we don't know what letters? At those positions? 

So for position 2? We know U is not there? But what about? In POLKA? O at 2? So we test O at position 2? 

In GLOAT? Position 2: L? 

Both? 

But since O can be anywhere? 

Also? We want to maximize information? 

Perhaps GLOAT? Because it tests L? 

But I'll go with POLKA? Because? 

Wait? Another possibility: since we have excluded many vowels? U,I? And E? Then vowels left? Usually words have vowels? So O and A? And maybe Y? For now? 

But we don't know? 

Now? I think we choose? 

But note: using a word that has O and A? And common consonants? 

So ""POLKA"" and ""GLOAT"" are both fine? 

Then let's choose ""GLOAT""? 

Or ""CROAK"": C excluded.

I'll pick ""GLOAT""? 

Guess: GLOAT? 

But wait? Let me check: 

With GLOAT? 
   G(1), L(2), O(3), A(4), T(5)

Now, the constraints:
   A must be at 2,4,5? Here at 4? Which is okay? 
   Must avoid placing A at 1? 
   O must not be at 5? Here at 3? Not 5? Okay? 

And letters: G,L,O,A,T? Avoids C,R,N,E,U,D,I? 

Yes? 

But note: we don't know if G,L,T are in the word? So we test? 

Therefore? Guess: GLOAT? 

Alternatively? Let me think of ""ATOLL""? 
   A(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), L(5)? Repeated L? Not distinct? 

So not optimal? 

Therefore? GLOAT or POLKA? 

I'll go with GLOAT? 

Second thought: POLKA puts O at position 2 and A at 5? Which are two different possibilities? 

In GLOAT: O at 3 and A at 4? 

Both are okay? 

But note? Position 3: O? We haven't tested O at 3? But we have tested A at position 3? But not the same letter? 

So no problem? 

So I guess: GLOAT? 

But? Another word? ""BOAST""? 
   B(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)? 
   But O at 2? A at 3? 
   But for A: position 3 was tested in crane? And we got A was present? But not at position 3? And we are trying A at position 3 again? Oh! But no: we know A is not at position 3? From the first guess? 

In BOAST? If I put A at position 3? Then? The feedback would say x? Because A is in the word? But not at position 3? So why put A there? It will give dash? But we already know? 

Actually? In guess 1? Crane? Position 3: A -> dash? Meaning A is present but not at position 3? 

Therefore? In BOAST? If I put A at position 3? Then we will get dash? Meaning same as before? So we learn nothing? 

Therefore? We must avoid placing A at position 3? Because we already know it is not there? And for O? Position 5 we tested? Not? 

So BOAST: 
   Position 3: A? Not allowed? So we must avoid? Therefore? BOAST is invalid? 

Whereas? GLOAT: A at position 4? Which is fine? 

Similarly? POLKA: A at 5? Fine? 

But using A? Which we know? At a new position? 

So I think GLOAT is good? 

Therefore? Next guess: GLOAT? 

But wait? What is the feedback we got so far? 

Actually? In audio? We also have O(-)? So O is present but not at position 5? 

Nothing else? 

So guess: gloat? 
   Positions: G(1)? L(2)? O(3)? A(4)? T(5) 

I think it's valid? 

Alternatively? ""VALOR""? But R excluded? 

So I'll go with GLOAT.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had A present (wrong position) and C/R/N/E absent.
- ""audio"" confirmed A exists but not in position 1, O exists but not in position 5, and U/D/I are absent.

### Deductions:
1. **A** must be in position **2, 4, or 5** (cannot be 1 or 3).
2. **O** must be in position **1, 2, 3, or 4** (cannot be 5).
3. **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I (7 letters).
4. **Confirmed letters**: A, O (2 letters).
5. The secret word has 3 unknown letters from: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For this guess:
- Must include **A and O** to refine their positions.
- Avoid placing A in positions 1/3 and O in position 5.
- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize new information.
- Test frequent consonants (L, T, S, etc.) to cover common patterns.

**Selected word: GLOAT**  
- G (new letter), L (new letter), O (position 3), A (position 4), T (new letter).  
- Avoids excluded positions/letters:  
  - A is in position 4 (valid: 2/4/5).  
  - O is in position 3 (valid: 1/2/3/4).  
- Tests new consonants (G, L, T), which are common.  

This guess efficiently narrows possible positions for A and O while testing three high-frequency consonants.

<guess>gloat</guess>",gloat,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 (since it was placed at position 1 in this guess) and not in position 3 (from previous). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5? But note, in ""audio"", A was in position 1 and we got a dash (-), meaning it's in the word but not at position 1. Similarly, O was given a dash, meaning O is in the word but not in position 5 (since we put O at position 5 in this guess) and not in position 4? Actually, for O: since we put it at position 5 and got a dash, it means O is in the word but not in position 5. Also, U and D and I are not in the word? Because they are marked x.

Additionally:
- U is not in the word.
- D is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 5.

So now we know:
- Letters in the word: A and O? And we know two letters: A and O? But there could be more? Actually, we know A and O are present? And others? But we haven't found all.

Also, from guess 1: we only knew A? Then guess 2: O is added? And we eliminated U,D,I.

So now we have:
- Present letters: A and O.
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I. (so far 7 letters excluded: C,R,N,E,U,D,I)

The word has 5 letters? So we have two known letters: A and O? And three unknown.

But note: O is only said to be present? And A is present? We don't know where.

We also know:
- For A: it is not in position 1 (from audio) and not in position 3 (from crane). Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5? Actually, positions: 
    - In crane: A was tested at position 3? So avoid position 3.
    - In audio: A was tested at position 1? So avoid position 1.
    Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, for O: it is tested only in position 5 (in audio) and given dash? Meaning O is in the word? But not in position 5. 
We haven't tested O at other positions? So O can be in any position except 5? And except where? We don't know? So O can be in position 1,2,3, or 4? But note: we have the positions: 

Now, we know O is in the word? But not in position 5. 

But what positions are possible for O?
- We haven't tested O elsewhere? So no other constraints? So O can be in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

But note: if O were in position 1, and we put A in position 1 in audio, why didn't we get O in position 1? We put U in position 2? Etc.? Actually, the feedback symbols: we got A at position 1: (-) meaning A is in the word but not at position 1? And O at position 5: (-) meaning O is in the word but not at position 5? And U,D,I: absent.

So we need to include both A and O in our next guess? And avoid excluded letters: C,R,N,E,U,D,I? And avoid placing A in positions 1 and 3? And avoid O in position 5.

Therefore, our next guess must:
- Include A and O? (since we know they are in the word? Yes? But are there more? We don't know? We have two confirmed letters? The word might have duplicates? But for now, we assume distinct? Because? Well, we haven't seen duplicates? But possible? But we can avoid duplicate letters? Actually, better to use distinct letters? So we include A and O? And we include three new letters? 

But note: could the word have letters that we haven't guessed? Yes? So we have to consider.

Now, positions:
We must place A in position 2, 4, or 5? And O in position 1,2,3, or 4? But avoid placing O in position 5? Already excluded.

Also, note that O and A might not be duplicates? So we cannot place them at the same position? (unless duplicates? but we avoid).

Therefore, we have to choose positions for A and O? But also? We don't know the other letters? So we need to test new letters.

Now, the word must? Have 5 letters? Two known? So three unknowns? 

So potential word: we are guessing a word that has A and O? And avoid excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,N,E,U,D,I? So available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z, and we already have A and O? But we need to use three more?

Let's also recall: frequent English consonants: L,S,T,B,P,M, etc.

We can try to form words that include A and O? And assign A to one of the positions: 2,4,5? And O to one of positions 1,2,3,4? And not overlapping? Unless duplicates? 

Since no duplication? Then assign distinct positions.

Possible placements:

If A is in position 2? Then O cannot be in 2? So O in 1,3,4? 

Similarly, A in position 4: O in 1,2,3? 
A in position 5: O in 1,2,3,4.

And we don't know which? So we need to choose one.

But also? We want to test common letters? And avoid losing try? 

So let me think of common words? 

Example: ""LOCAL""? -> contains C? Excluded? C is excluded? So invalid.

""BOOST""? -> contains O twice? and E? E excluded? But also? Has E? No? Boost: B,O,O,S,T? Not distinct? And has repeated O? And no A? Must have A.

So must include A? 

""ABOUT""? -> contains U? Excluded? U is excluded? From audio feedback? We know U is not in word? So avoid.

""MANGO"": contains M,A,N,G,O? But N excluded? N is excluded? So invalid.

""SOLAR"": contains S,O,L,A,R? But R excluded? So invalid.

""PLAIN"": contains L,A,I,N? But I and N excluded? Invalid.

So hard? 

How about ""POLKA""? -> P,O,L,K,A? 
Letters: P,O,L,K,A? Avoids C,R,N,E,U,D,I? Yes? And positions: 
Position 1: P
Position 2: O
Position 3: L
Position 4: K
Position 5: A

Now, check for A: A is in position 5? Which is allowed? Because A can be in 2,4,5? So 5 is allowed.
O is in position 2? Which is one of the positions? And not position 5? So O is fine? But wait, O not in position 5? Yes? And we have assigned O to 2? 

But know? We must check: 
Is it possible that O could be in position 1? We haven't tested? But in ""audio"", we only tested O at position 5? So no? 

Similarly, for A: in position 5? Which is one of the possibilities? 

But wait: the secret word could have O in position 1? And we put O at position 2? Then we would get a dash? And similarly, A at 5? 

With ""polka"": 
   Position: P(1), O(2), L(3), K(4), A(5)

But we have constraints? 
For O: it is not in position 5? But here we put it at 2? Which is fine? Perhaps.
And for A: not in 1 or 3? So at 5? Is allowed? 

But note: what is the word? ""POLKA""? Is it a valid word? Yes? It means dance.

We introduce P,O,L,K,A? All distinct? And avoid excluded letters? Yes? 

So let's use that.

But note: we are testing positions? But could we get information? Yes? 

If we get:
   If O is actually in position 2? Then we get O(✓)? But we don't know?
   Similarly, if A is actually in position 5? Then A(✓)? 

But the word might not be POLKA? But we are choosing a guess to get feedback? 

Alternatively, we could arrange the positions differently? For example, putting O at position 1? And A at position 4? 

Then word: ""OASIS""? -> repeated S? and doesn't avoid? But O(1),A(2),S(3)...? But S? Then I? Excluded? Invalid.

""OSCAR""? -> contains C? Excluded.

""JOKER""? -> contains E and R? Excluded.

So ""POLKA"" seems good? 

But note: we have to include both A and O? And avoid constraints.

Another word: ""GLOAT""? 
   G,L,O,A,T? 
   Positions: 
      Position 1: G
      Position 2: L
      Position 3: O? 
      Position 4: A
      Position 5: T

Now, for A: we place at position 4? Which is allowed? And O at position 3? 
For O: position 3 has not been tested? So it's possible? But we must avoid for A? A is at position 4? Which is fine? 
And O: O at position 3? 
But we put O at position 3? And we haven't tested O at position 3 before? So we don't know? 

But the word: G,L,O,A,T? Avoids exclusions? G,L,O,A,T -> no excluded letter? 

Similarly good? 

But ""gloat""? 

Alternatively, ""SPLAT""? 
   S,P,L,A,T? 
   Positions: 
      S(1), P(2), L(3), A(4), T(5)? 
   Then A at position 4? 
   But no O? We must include O? Because we know O is in the word? If we don't include O, we don't get feedback for O's position? And we waste a guess? 

So we must include O? So ""SPLAT"" doesn't include O? 

Therefore, invalid? 

We require the word to contain both A and O? 

So words like ""POLKA"" or ""GLOAT""? Or ""CLOAK""? But ""cloak"" has C? Excluded.

So:

""POLKA"": P,O,L,K,A -> positions: O at 2, A at 5? 
""GLOAT"": G,L,O,A,T -> positions: O at 3, A at 4? 

Which one to choose? 

In ""POLKA"":
   O is at position 2? Which we haven't tested? 
   A is at position 5? Which we haven't tested? 

In ""GLOAT"":
   O is at position 3? 
   A is at position 4? 

What were previously restricted for A? 
   A: not at 1 or 3? Because: 
      In crane: A not at position 3? 
      In audio: A not at position 1? 
   So for A? Positions 2,4,5? 
   Position 3? Already tested and not? 

Similarly, O has been tested only at position 5? Which we know not? So O can be at 1,2,3,4.

In ""POLKA"": 
   O at 2? And A at 5? So we test two positions: 
      O at position 2: if correct? ✓? Otherwise? 
      Also? We test new letters P,L,K? 

Similarly? In ""GLOAT"": 
   O at 3? A at 4? Test G,L,T? 

But note: we have also? Frequency? T is more frequent than K? 

How about ""PASTA""? 
   P,A,S,T,A? Repeated A? Not good? 
   But also? Avoid O? Must include O.

Given that? 

I think either POLKA or GLOAT is fine? 

But let me think? We can choose GLOAT? because it puts A in position 4 and O in position 3? 

Wait? Position 3? We tested A at position 3? But not O? So O might be at position 3? 

Similarly? In POLKA? We put O at position 2? Which might be correct? 

Arbitrary? Then let's pick GLOAT? 

But try? 

Alternatively? ""SHOAL""? 
   S,H,O,A,L? 
   Positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), A(4), L(5)? 
   Then avoid? 
   Letters: S,H,O,A,L -> avoids exclusions? 
   O at position 3? A at position 4? 

And we introduce S,H,L? 

Another: ""FLORA""? But R excluded? 

""BLOKA"": maybe not a word? 

So let me choose ""SHOAL""? 

SHOAL: S at position 1? But we haven't tested S? 

Or GLOAT: G,L,O,A,T -> O at 3? A at 4.

To decide? Note? In ""audio"" we tried U (position 2) and D (position 3) and I (position 4) and got x? So we know position 2 doesn't have U? Position 3 doesn't have D? Position 4 doesn't have I? 

But we don't know what letters? At those positions? 

So for position 2? We know U is not there? But what about? In POLKA? O at 2? So we test O at position 2? 

In GLOAT? Position 2: L? 

Both? 

But since O can be anywhere? 

Also? We want to maximize information? 

Perhaps GLOAT? Because it tests L? 

But I'll go with POLKA? Because? 

Wait? Another possibility: since we have excluded many vowels? U,I? And E? Then vowels left? Usually words have vowels? So O and A? And maybe Y? For now? 

But we don't know? 

Now? I think we choose? 

But note: using a word that has O and A? And common consonants? 

So ""POLKA"" and ""GLOAT"" are both fine? 

Then let's choose ""GLOAT""? 

Or ""CROAK"": C excluded.

I'll pick ""GLOAT""? 

Guess: GLOAT? 

But wait? Let me check: 

With GLOAT? 
   G(1), L(2), O(3), A(4), T(5)

Now, the constraints:
   A must be at 2,4,5? Here at 4? Which is okay? 
   Must avoid placing A at 1? 
   O must not be at 5? Here at 3? Not 5? Okay? 

And letters: G,L,O,A,T? Avoids C,R,N,E,U,D,I? 

Yes? 

But note: we don't know if G,L,T are in the word? So we test? 

Therefore? Guess: GLOAT? 

Alternatively? Let me think of ""ATOLL""? 
   A(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), L(5)? Repeated L? Not distinct? 

So not optimal? 

Therefore? GLOAT or POLKA? 

I'll go with GLOAT? 

Second thought: POLKA puts O at position 2 and A at 5? Which are two different possibilities? 

In GLOAT: O at 3 and A at 4? 

Both are okay? 

But note? Position 3: O? We haven't tested O at 3? But we have tested A at position 3? But not the same letter? 

So no problem? 

So I guess: GLOAT? 

But? Another word? ""BOAST""? 
   B(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)? 
   But O at 2? A at 3? 
   But for A: position 3 was tested in crane? And we got A was present? But not at position 3? And we are trying A at position 3 again? Oh! But no: we know A is not at position 3? From the first guess? 

In BOAST? If I put A at position 3? Then? The feedback would say x? Because A is in the word? But not at position 3? So why put A there? It will give dash? But we already know? 

Actually? In guess 1? Crane? Position 3: A -> dash? Meaning A is present but not at position 3? 

Therefore? In BOAST? If I put A at position 3? Then we will get dash? Meaning same as before? So we learn nothing? 

Therefore? We must avoid placing A at position 3? Because we already know it is not there? And for O? Position 5 we tested? Not? 

So BOAST: 
   Position 3: A? Not allowed? So we must avoid? Therefore? BOAST is invalid? 

Whereas? GLOAT: A at position 4? Which is fine? 

Similarly? POLKA: A at 5? Fine? 

But using A? Which we know? At a new position? 

So I think GLOAT is good? 

Therefore? Next guess: GLOAT? 

But wait? What is the feedback we got so far? 

Actually? In audio? We also have O(-)? So O is present but not at position 5? 

Nothing else? 

So guess: gloat? 
   Positions: G(1)? L(2)? O(3)? A(4)? T(5) 

I think it's valid? 

Alternatively? ""VALOR""? But R excluded? 

So I'll go with GLOAT.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had A present (wrong position) and C/R/N/E absent.
- ""audio"" confirmed A exists but not in position 1, O exists but not in position 5, and U/D/I are absent.

### Deductions:
1. **A** must be in position **2, 4, or 5** (cannot be 1 or 3).
2. **O** must be in position **1, 2, 3, or 4** (cannot be 5).
3. **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I (7 letters).
4. **Confirmed letters**: A, O (2 letters).
5. The secret word has 3 unknown letters from: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For this guess:
- Must include **A and O** to refine their positions.
- Avoid placing A in positions 1/3 and O in position 5.
- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize new information.
- Test frequent consonants (L, T, S, etc.) to cover common patterns.

**Selected word: GLOAT**  
- G (new letter), L (new letter), O (position 3), A (position 4), T (new letter).  
- Avoids excluded positions/letters:  
  - A is in position 4 (valid: 2/4/5).  
  - O is in position 3 (valid: 1/2/3/4).  
- Tests new consonants (G, L, T), which are common.  

This guess efficiently narrows possible positions for A and O while testing three high-frequency consonants.",Guess 3: gloat -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(-) O(✓) A(✓) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,SHOAL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters to maximize information.
 A good starting word usually has common letters (like vowels and frequent consonants) and no repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AUDIO"", etc.

 Let me choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
   S: common consonant
   L: common consonant
   A: common vowel
   T: common consonant
   E: common vowel

 This gives us a good spread of common letters.

 So, for the first guess, we'll guess: SLATE<thinking>
For the first guess with no prior information, I need a word that maximizes the information gained about the secret word. A good starting word should:
- Contain common letters to increase the chance of hitting correct letters
- Include a mix of vowels and common consonants
- Avoid repeated letters to cover more possibilities

Words like ""SLATE"" are strong openers because they include:
- Vowels: A and E
- Common consonants: S, L, T
- All unique letters

""CRANE"" is another excellent choice for similar reasons. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- C and R are very common consonants
- A and E are top vowels
- N is also relatively frequent

This combination should provide meaningful feedback across multiple letter positions while testing common English patterns.
</thinking>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position.
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Since A is present but not in position 3, it must be in one of the other positions: 1,2,4, or 5.

 For our second guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
 - Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word)
 - Does not include C, R, N, E (since they are confirmed absent)
 - We should avoid repeating letters if possible to maximize information.

 Also, since A is not in position 3, we should place A in a different position (1,2,4, or 5).

 Ideas for second guess:
 - We want a word that includes A and other common letters not excluded. Excluded letters: C,R,N,E.

 Common letters in English include: S,T,L,I,O,B,D,G,H,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y etc.

 Let's think of words that contain A, and avoid C,R,N,E.

 Possible words:
 - ""salad"" -> but repeated letters (A twice) - maybe not optimal
 - ""salsa"" -> repeated S and A, and only 4 letters? No, S A L S A -> not 5 distinct, and repeated letters might not give as much information.
 - ""plate"" -> contains E -> excluded
 - ""blast"" -> avoid: has S,T,L,B,A -> let's check: B,L,A,S,T. This avoids the excluded letters.

 Word: ""blast""
   Positions: B(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)

 However, note that in the previous feedback, A was not in position 3. But here we put A in position 3? That would be against the feedback?
 Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot place A in position 3 again.

 Therefore, we must put A in a position that isn't 3.

 Alternative words:

 Let's try to put A in position 1: 
   Example: ""adios"" -> contains D,I,O,S. But we don't know if D,I,O,S are safe? 
   But note: we want to test new letters.

 However, ""adios"" contains S and O, which are common.

 Another idea: ""about"" -> contains B,O,U,T. But we don't know about these letters.

 How about ""stamp""? 
   - S,T,A,M,P. 
   - A is in position 3? -> but we know A is not in position 3. So we cannot put A in position 3 again.
   So move A to a different position.

 We can try ""patsy"": 
   - P(1), A(2), T(3), S(4), Y(5) -> A is in position 2.

 Avoid any word that has A in position 3.

 Also, avoid C,R,N,E.

 Another good candidate: ""aisle"" -> contains E? Yes -> excluded.

 Avoid E.

 So, let's try ""salty"": 
   - S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5): 
   A is in position 2 -> good because it was not in position 3 and we avoid placing it in 3.

 But note: we don't know if S,L,T,Y are in the word? We want to test.

 Another: ""valid"": contains V,A,L,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E. 
   Positions: V(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), D(5) -> A in position 2.

 However, note that we haven't tested T,S,H,O,M,P etc.

 Since we excluded four letters (C,R,N,E) and know A is one letter, we have 21 letters left? Actually, 26-5=21 letters available.

 We need to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Considering commonality: T is very frequent, S is frequent, etc.

 So words like ""taffy"" -> repeated F, bad. 

 How about ""bails""? 
   B(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> A in position 2, avoids E, avoids C,R,N, and introduces B,I,L,S.

 Also, we are testing 4 new letters: B,I,L,S.

 However, note position 3: I? We have no information about that.

 Alternatively, ""daisy"": 
   D(1),A(2),I(3),S(4),Y(5) -> similar, introduces D,I,S,Y and A.

 Both seem okay.

 But note: we must avoid E? yes. Both avoid.

 Another idea: ""basil"" -> 
   B(1),A(2),S(3),I(4),L(5) -> again A in position 2.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word might have an A in position 1,2,4,5.

 We need to test positions differently? 

 Since we know A is present and not in position 3, testing it in position 2 (for example) will help us determine if that's its spot or not.

 Alternatively, we might avoid position 2 as well? Not necessary, because we don't have a reason to avoid position 2. The previous feedback didn't rule out any position for A except position 3.

 So, let's go with a word that has A in a new position (like 2) and tests many common letters.

 ""BASAL"" -> repeated A, avoid.

 ""BASIL"": 
   Letters: B, A, S, I, L -> all distinct. And A in position 2? Actually, in ""basil"" the positions are:
   B-A-S-I-L? Wait, no: 
   Position 1: B
   Position 2: A
   Position 3: S
   Position 4: I
   Position 5: L

 But wait, the word ""basil"" is 5 letters? Yes.

 However, note that ""salad"" has two A's and we avoid repeated to get more information. So ""basil"" with distinct letters is better.

 Alternatively, ""habit"": 
   H(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), T(5) -> A in position 2. 

 Or ""macho"" -> but wait, M,A,C,H,O -> C is excluded? Yes! We cannot use C because it's excluded.

 So ""habit"": contains H,A,B,I,T -> avoids the excluded letters.

 Similarly, ""gawky"": G,A,W,K,Y -> avoids exclusions, but not very common? 

 We should aim for words that use common consonants and vowels.

 Another choice: ""pastel"" -> contains E -> excluded.

 So between ""basil"", ""bails"", ""daisy"", ""habit"", etc.

 I think ""habit"" is good because it uses T and H, which are common. 
 And it places A in position 2? But maybe the secret word has A in position 1,4,5? 

 Actually, we are testing position 2: if we put A in position 2 and it is correct, then we know. If not, then we know A is not in position 2 either? 

 Alternatively, we could test A in a different position to get more coverage? 

 For example, testing A in position 1 or 4 or 5. 

 Let me try to get A not in position 2 or 3.

 How about ""piano"" -> contains O, but also A in position 3? -> but we cannot place A in position 3.

 ""piano"" has A at position 3 -> invalid because we know A isn't in position 3.

 So words with A at positions 1,2,4,5.

 Position 1: ""adult"", ""abyss"", etc... but ""abyss"" has repeated S? So not distinct.

 Similarly, ""agile"" -> contains E? excluded.

 ""daily"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> A in position 2? Wait: 
   D(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5) -> A in position 2.

 Same as before.

 How about putting A in position 4? 
   Example: ""spade"" -> contains E? excluded.

 Without E: ""draft"" -> D(1), R(2), A(3), F(4), T(5) -> A in position 3? Invalid.

 ""focal"" -> contains C? excluded.

 ""latch"" -> L(1), A(2), T(3), C(4), H(5) -> C excluded? yes.

 It's tricky.

 Another word with A at position 4: ""ultra"" -> 
   U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5) -> but R is excluded? We got R: x in the first guess.

 So we can't use R.

 Put A at position 5: 
   ""mania"" -> repeated A? and also contains N? which is excluded.

 ""scuba"" -> S(1), C(2), U(3), B(4), A(5) -> contains C? excluded.

 ""vodka"" -> V(1), O(2), D(3), K(4), A(5) -> avoids excluded letters? 
   Check: excluded are C,R,N,E -> V,O,D,K,A (A is allowed) -> V,O,D,K are new.

 But we know A is present, so we must include A anyway? Yes, but we are putting A at position 5.

 Alternatively, ""tidal"": 
   T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5) -> A at position 4? 
   But ""tidal"" has L at the end? Yes.

 Now we test A at position 4.

 Similarly, ""viral"" -> but contains R? excluded.

 So ""tidal"": 
   Letters: T, I, D, A, L -> avoids excluded letters? 
   T, I, D, A, L -> none of them are C,R,N,E? Good.

 But note: we tested A in position 4? 

 However, ""tidal"" uses T, I, D, A, L.

 Another alternative: ""staid"": 
   S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5) -> but A is in position 3? which we know is not allowed.

 Therefore, for guess 2:

 Option 1: ""TIDAL"" (with A at 4) 
   -> T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5)

 Option 2: ""BASIL"" (with A at 2) 
   -> B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), L(5)

 Both introduce common letters.

 Considering letter frequency: 
   T is very common, S is very common, L and I are common too.

 So both words are good. 

 However, note that we also want to test letters that might be in the word. Since the first guess only gave us one letter (A) present, we have four more to find.

 We decide: Let's go with ""tidal"" because it places A in a position we haven't tested (position 4). The previous guess had A in position 3? We know that was wrong, so testing A in position 4 might be better than position 2? 

 Actually, testing the same letter in a different position is good if that position is likely.

 But we don't have much information, so it's arbitrary.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that also tests vowels that we haven't checked? 

 We know E is out? So vowels remaining: A is already known. Then: I, O, U? 

 We haven't tested O or U? But I is in both ""tidal"" and ""basil"".

 How about ""audio""? 
   - A(1), U(2), D(3), I(4), O(5) 
   - Avoids exclusions? 
   - But we know A is present, and we put it in position 1? 
   - Also, we test U, D, I, O.

 And all distinct letters? Yes.

 Also, we avoid the excluded letters: no C,R,N,E.

 Let's consider ""audio"":
   - Tests A at position 1? 
   - Tests U, D, I, O.

 Since we know A is in the word, putting it at position 1 might give us more information? 

 Then let's compare:

 Option 3: ""AUDIO"" -> which is a classical starting word? 

 But we already made one guess.

 ""AUDIO"" has A at position 1: might be correct? Or it might not.

 Now, comparing the choices:

 - ""AUDIO"": 
     Letters: A, U, D, I, O -> tests vowels and D? And positions: we haven't seen position 1? 

 - ""BASIL"": 
     Letters: B,A,S,I,L -> consonants B,S,L and vowels A,I.

 - ""TIDAL"": 
     Letters: T,I,D,A,L -> similar to AUDIO? But T/L instead of U/O.

 Actually, ""tidal"" has T and D? So quite different.

 Since we are more in the dark? But we have the constraint on A: it cannot be in position 3.

 So ""audio"": 
   Positions: A(1), U(2), D(3), I(4), O(5)

 Let me see if ""audio"" is a valid word? Yes.

 It tests:
   A in position 1 (was previously tested in position 3 and was wrong? Now we test if it is in position 1).
   Plus we test U,D,I,O.

 The feedback might be very informative.

 But note: if A is not in position 1, then we get a '-' for A? Then we know A must be in position 4 or 5? (or 2? but we put U at 2) 

 Actually, we test position 1 for A? If it's not correct, then A must be in one of the positions: 2,4,5? 

 But wait, in the word ""audio"", the positions: 
   If A is in the secret word but not in position 1, then it must be in position 2? But we put U at 2. Or in position 4? We have I at 4? Or position 5? We have O at 5. 

 Since the letters in positions 2,4,5 are all unique? Yes, so if A is in the word but not at 1, then it might show as in position 2? but actually we have U at 2, etc. 

 Actually: the feedback will tell us if A is present? We already know it's in the word, so the feedback symbol for A will be either:
   - ✓ if it is in the correct position? Then position 1 is green.
   - - if it is in the word but in a different position? Then we know A is not in position 1.

 Similarly, for other letters.

 So I think ""audio"" is a good guess for the second attempt.

 But note: we are testing only one vowel? Actually, we test A,U,I,O? Quite vowel-heavy? But vowels are important.

 However, the secret word might have only one vowel? But A is already one, and we are testing two more? 

 Given that five-letter words usually have several vowels, it's okay.

 Alternatively, we can use ""tidal"" to test T and D? 

 Considering frequency of letters? We have excluded E, which is very frequent. Then T is the most frequent letter? 

 So testing T might be important.

 Therefore, let me propose:

 Option 4: ""TOAST"" -> but repeated T? and A at position 3? Not allowed.

 How about ""LASTS""? -> repeated S? and A at position 2? But we haven't tested S,L? 

 But ""lasts"" has repeated S: not ideal.

 Then, let's choose ""tidal"" or ""audio""?

 Since T is so common, maybe ""tidal"" is better? 

 But ""tidal"" also introduces T? 

 Actually, both ""audio"" and ""tidal"" have distinct letters, so they are equally good? 

 Let me choose ""audio"": 
   Why? Because it tests multiple vowels. Since the word contains A, which is a vowel, it might have other vowels? 

 And if ""audio"" doesn't give us any additional letters? Then we know that U,D,I,O are absent? 

 But also, we get positional information.

 Alternatively, I found ""paint"": 
   P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> contains N? Excluded -> invalid.

 ""light"": doesn't have A? We must include A because we know it's present? Otherwise we waste? 

 Yes, we know A is in the word? So if we don't include A in the guess, we won't get feedback about its position? 

 And we still need to locate A.

 Therefore, we must include A.

 So back to including A: words like ""audio"", ""basil"", ""tidal"", ""habit"", etc.

 I'll go with ""audio"".<thinking>
The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" provided critical information:
- C, R, N, and E are not in the word at all (marked ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in the third position (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Since A must be present, it should be included but not in position 3.
- Avoid C, R, N, E entirely, as they have been eliminated.
- Test new common letters to maximize information gain, prioritizing other vowels and consonants.
- Position A in a different spot—position 1, 2, 4, or 5—to narrow down its location.

Considering words that meet these criteria:
- ""AUDIO"" is a strong candidate: 
  - Includes A (position 1), avoiding position 3.
  - Avoids C, R, N, E.
  - Tests three new vowels (U, I, O) and one consonant (D), which are common and could reveal additional vowels or positional data.
  - All distinct letters minimize redundancy.

Other options like ""BASIL"" (A in position 2) or ""TIDAL"" (A in position 4) are also valid, but ""AUDIO"" efficiently tests multiple new vowels at once, leveraging the elimination of E to prioritize less frequent vowels (U, I, O). This could provide quick insights into vowel placement and frequency.

<guess>audio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 (since it was placed at position 1 in this guess) and not in position 3 (from previous). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5? But note, in ""audio"", A was in position 1 and we got a dash (-), meaning it's in the word but not at position 1. Similarly, O was given a dash, meaning O is in the word but not in position 5 (since we put O at position 5 in this guess) and not in position 4? Actually, for O: since we put it at position 5 and got a dash, it means O is in the word but not in position 5. Also, U and D and I are not in the word? Because they are marked x.

Additionally:
- U is not in the word.
- D is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 5.

So now we know:
- Letters in the word: A and O? And we know two letters: A and O? But there could be more? Actually, we know A and O are present? And others? But we haven't found all.

Also, from guess 1: we only knew A? Then guess 2: O is added? And we eliminated U,D,I.

So now we have:
- Present letters: A and O.
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I. (so far 7 letters excluded: C,R,N,E,U,D,I)

The word has 5 letters? So we have two known letters: A and O? And three unknown.

But note: O is only said to be present? And A is present? We don't know where.

We also know:
- For A: it is not in position 1 (from audio) and not in position 3 (from crane). Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5? Actually, positions: 
    - In crane: A was tested at position 3? So avoid position 3.
    - In audio: A was tested at position 1? So avoid position 1.
    Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, for O: it is tested only in position 5 (in audio) and given dash? Meaning O is in the word? But not in position 5. 
We haven't tested O at other positions? So O can be in any position except 5? And except where? We don't know? So O can be in position 1,2,3, or 4? But note: we have the positions: 

Now, we know O is in the word? But not in position 5. 

But what positions are possible for O?
- We haven't tested O elsewhere? So no other constraints? So O can be in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

But note: if O were in position 1, and we put A in position 1 in audio, why didn't we get O in position 1? We put U in position 2? Etc.? Actually, the feedback symbols: we got A at position 1: (-) meaning A is in the word but not at position 1? And O at position 5: (-) meaning O is in the word but not at position 5? And U,D,I: absent.

So we need to include both A and O in our next guess? And avoid excluded letters: C,R,N,E,U,D,I? And avoid placing A in positions 1 and 3? And avoid O in position 5.

Therefore, our next guess must:
- Include A and O? (since we know they are in the word? Yes? But are there more? We don't know? We have two confirmed letters? The word might have duplicates? But for now, we assume distinct? Because? Well, we haven't seen duplicates? But possible? But we can avoid duplicate letters? Actually, better to use distinct letters? So we include A and O? And we include three new letters? 

But note: could the word have letters that we haven't guessed? Yes? So we have to consider.

Now, positions:
We must place A in position 2, 4, or 5? And O in position 1,2,3, or 4? But avoid placing O in position 5? Already excluded.

Also, note that O and A might not be duplicates? So we cannot place them at the same position? (unless duplicates? but we avoid).

Therefore, we have to choose positions for A and O? But also? We don't know the other letters? So we need to test new letters.

Now, the word must? Have 5 letters? Two known? So three unknowns? 

So potential word: we are guessing a word that has A and O? And avoid excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,N,E,U,D,I? So available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z, and we already have A and O? But we need to use three more?

Let's also recall: frequent English consonants: L,S,T,B,P,M, etc.

We can try to form words that include A and O? And assign A to one of the positions: 2,4,5? And O to one of positions 1,2,3,4? And not overlapping? Unless duplicates? 

Since no duplication? Then assign distinct positions.

Possible placements:

If A is in position 2? Then O cannot be in 2? So O in 1,3,4? 

Similarly, A in position 4: O in 1,2,3? 
A in position 5: O in 1,2,3,4.

And we don't know which? So we need to choose one.

But also? We want to test common letters? And avoid losing try? 

So let me think of common words? 

Example: ""LOCAL""? -> contains C? Excluded? C is excluded? So invalid.

""BOOST""? -> contains O twice? and E? E excluded? But also? Has E? No? Boost: B,O,O,S,T? Not distinct? And has repeated O? And no A? Must have A.

So must include A? 

""ABOUT""? -> contains U? Excluded? U is excluded? From audio feedback? We know U is not in word? So avoid.

""MANGO"": contains M,A,N,G,O? But N excluded? N is excluded? So invalid.

""SOLAR"": contains S,O,L,A,R? But R excluded? So invalid.

""PLAIN"": contains L,A,I,N? But I and N excluded? Invalid.

So hard? 

How about ""POLKA""? -> P,O,L,K,A? 
Letters: P,O,L,K,A? Avoids C,R,N,E,U,D,I? Yes? And positions: 
Position 1: P
Position 2: O
Position 3: L
Position 4: K
Position 5: A

Now, check for A: A is in position 5? Which is allowed? Because A can be in 2,4,5? So 5 is allowed.
O is in position 2? Which is one of the positions? And not position 5? So O is fine? But wait, O not in position 5? Yes? And we have assigned O to 2? 

But know? We must check: 
Is it possible that O could be in position 1? We haven't tested? But in ""audio"", we only tested O at position 5? So no? 

Similarly, for A: in position 5? Which is one of the possibilities? 

But wait: the secret word could have O in position 1? And we put O at position 2? Then we would get a dash? And similarly, A at 5? 

With ""polka"": 
   Position: P(1), O(2), L(3), K(4), A(5)

But we have constraints? 
For O: it is not in position 5? But here we put it at 2? Which is fine? Perhaps.
And for A: not in 1 or 3? So at 5? Is allowed? 

But note: what is the word? ""POLKA""? Is it a valid word? Yes? It means dance.

We introduce P,O,L,K,A? All distinct? And avoid excluded letters? Yes? 

So let's use that.

But note: we are testing positions? But could we get information? Yes? 

If we get:
   If O is actually in position 2? Then we get O(✓)? But we don't know?
   Similarly, if A is actually in position 5? Then A(✓)? 

But the word might not be POLKA? But we are choosing a guess to get feedback? 

Alternatively, we could arrange the positions differently? For example, putting O at position 1? And A at position 4? 

Then word: ""OASIS""? -> repeated S? and doesn't avoid? But O(1),A(2),S(3)...? But S? Then I? Excluded? Invalid.

""OSCAR""? -> contains C? Excluded.

""JOKER""? -> contains E and R? Excluded.

So ""POLKA"" seems good? 

But note: we have to include both A and O? And avoid constraints.

Another word: ""GLOAT""? 
   G,L,O,A,T? 
   Positions: 
      Position 1: G
      Position 2: L
      Position 3: O? 
      Position 4: A
      Position 5: T

Now, for A: we place at position 4? Which is allowed? And O at position 3? 
For O: position 3 has not been tested? So it's possible? But we must avoid for A? A is at position 4? Which is fine? 
And O: O at position 3? 
But we put O at position 3? And we haven't tested O at position 3 before? So we don't know? 

But the word: G,L,O,A,T? Avoids exclusions? G,L,O,A,T -> no excluded letter? 

Similarly good? 

But ""gloat""? 

Alternatively, ""SPLAT""? 
   S,P,L,A,T? 
   Positions: 
      S(1), P(2), L(3), A(4), T(5)? 
   Then A at position 4? 
   But no O? We must include O? Because we know O is in the word? If we don't include O, we don't get feedback for O's position? And we waste a guess? 

So we must include O? So ""SPLAT"" doesn't include O? 

Therefore, invalid? 

We require the word to contain both A and O? 

So words like ""POLKA"" or ""GLOAT""? Or ""CLOAK""? But ""cloak"" has C? Excluded.

So:

""POLKA"": P,O,L,K,A -> positions: O at 2, A at 5? 
""GLOAT"": G,L,O,A,T -> positions: O at 3, A at 4? 

Which one to choose? 

In ""POLKA"":
   O is at position 2? Which we haven't tested? 
   A is at position 5? Which we haven't tested? 

In ""GLOAT"":
   O is at position 3? 
   A is at position 4? 

What were previously restricted for A? 
   A: not at 1 or 3? Because: 
      In crane: A not at position 3? 
      In audio: A not at position 1? 
   So for A? Positions 2,4,5? 
   Position 3? Already tested and not? 

Similarly, O has been tested only at position 5? Which we know not? So O can be at 1,2,3,4.

In ""POLKA"": 
   O at 2? And A at 5? So we test two positions: 
      O at position 2: if correct? ✓? Otherwise? 
      Also? We test new letters P,L,K? 

Similarly? In ""GLOAT"": 
   O at 3? A at 4? Test G,L,T? 

But note: we have also? Frequency? T is more frequent than K? 

How about ""PASTA""? 
   P,A,S,T,A? Repeated A? Not good? 
   But also? Avoid O? Must include O.

Given that? 

I think either POLKA or GLOAT is fine? 

But let me think? We can choose GLOAT? because it puts A in position 4 and O in position 3? 

Wait? Position 3? We tested A at position 3? But not O? So O might be at position 3? 

Similarly? In POLKA? We put O at position 2? Which might be correct? 

Arbitrary? Then let's pick GLOAT? 

But try? 

Alternatively? ""SHOAL""? 
   S,H,O,A,L? 
   Positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), A(4), L(5)? 
   Then avoid? 
   Letters: S,H,O,A,L -> avoids exclusions? 
   O at position 3? A at position 4? 

And we introduce S,H,L? 

Another: ""FLORA""? But R excluded? 

""BLOKA"": maybe not a word? 

So let me choose ""SHOAL""? 

SHOAL: S at position 1? But we haven't tested S? 

Or GLOAT: G,L,O,A,T -> O at 3? A at 4.

To decide? Note? In ""audio"" we tried U (position 2) and D (position 3) and I (position 4) and got x? So we know position 2 doesn't have U? Position 3 doesn't have D? Position 4 doesn't have I? 

But we don't know what letters? At those positions? 

So for position 2? We know U is not there? But what about? In POLKA? O at 2? So we test O at position 2? 

In GLOAT? Position 2: L? 

Both? 

But since O can be anywhere? 

Also? We want to maximize information? 

Perhaps GLOAT? Because it tests L? 

But I'll go with POLKA? Because? 

Wait? Another possibility: since we have excluded many vowels? U,I? And E? Then vowels left? Usually words have vowels? So O and A? And maybe Y? For now? 

But we don't know? 

Now? I think we choose? 

But note: using a word that has O and A? And common consonants? 

So ""POLKA"" and ""GLOAT"" are both fine? 

Then let's choose ""GLOAT""? 

Or ""CROAK"": C excluded.

I'll pick ""GLOAT""? 

Guess: GLOAT? 

But wait? Let me check: 

With GLOAT? 
   G(1), L(2), O(3), A(4), T(5)

Now, the constraints:
   A must be at 2,4,5? Here at 4? Which is okay? 
   Must avoid placing A at 1? 
   O must not be at 5? Here at 3? Not 5? Okay? 

And letters: G,L,O,A,T? Avoids C,R,N,E,U,D,I? 

Yes? 

But note: we don't know if G,L,T are in the word? So we test? 

Therefore? Guess: GLOAT? 

Alternatively? Let me think of ""ATOLL""? 
   A(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), L(5)? Repeated L? Not distinct? 

So not optimal? 

Therefore? GLOAT or POLKA? 

I'll go with GLOAT? 

Second thought: POLKA puts O at position 2 and A at 5? Which are two different possibilities? 

In GLOAT: O at 3 and A at 4? 

Both are okay? 

But note? Position 3: O? We haven't tested O at 3? But we have tested A at position 3? But not the same letter? 

So no problem? 

So I guess: GLOAT? 

But? Another word? ""BOAST""? 
   B(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)? 
   But O at 2? A at 3? 
   But for A: position 3 was tested in crane? And we got A was present? But not at position 3? And we are trying A at position 3 again? Oh! But no: we know A is not at position 3? From the first guess? 

In BOAST? If I put A at position 3? Then? The feedback would say x? Because A is in the word? But not at position 3? So why put A there? It will give dash? But we already know? 

Actually? In guess 1? Crane? Position 3: A -> dash? Meaning A is present but not at position 3? 

Therefore? In BOAST? If I put A at position 3? Then we will get dash? Meaning same as before? So we learn nothing? 

Therefore? We must avoid placing A at position 3? Because we already know it is not there? And for O? Position 5 we tested? Not? 

So BOAST: 
   Position 3: A? Not allowed? So we must avoid? Therefore? BOAST is invalid? 

Whereas? GLOAT: A at position 4? Which is fine? 

Similarly? POLKA: A at 5? Fine? 

But using A? Which we know? At a new position? 

So I think GLOAT is good? 

Therefore? Next guess: GLOAT? 

But wait? What is the feedback we got so far? 

Actually? In audio? We also have O(-)? So O is present but not at position 5? 

Nothing else? 

So guess: gloat? 
   Positions: G(1)? L(2)? O(3)? A(4)? T(5) 

I think it's valid? 

Alternatively? ""VALOR""? But R excluded? 

So I'll go with GLOAT.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had A present (wrong position) and C/R/N/E absent.
- ""audio"" confirmed A exists but not in position 1, O exists but not in position 5, and U/D/I are absent.

### Deductions:
1. **A** must be in position **2, 4, or 5** (cannot be 1 or 3).
2. **O** must be in position **1, 2, 3, or 4** (cannot be 5).
3. **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I (7 letters).
4. **Confirmed letters**: A, O (2 letters).
5. The secret word has 3 unknown letters from: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For this guess:
- Must include **A and O** to refine their positions.
- Avoid placing A in positions 1/3 and O in position 5.
- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize new information.
- Test frequent consonants (L, T, S, etc.) to cover common patterns.

**Selected word: GLOAT**  
- G (new letter), L (new letter), O (position 3), A (position 4), T (new letter).  
- Avoids excluded positions/letters:  
  - A is in position 4 (valid: 2/4/5).  
  - O is in position 3 (valid: 1/2/3/4).  
- Tests new consonants (G, L, T), which are common.  

This guess efficiently narrows possible positions for A and O while testing three high-frequency consonants.

No, S A L S A -> not 5 distinct, and repeated letters might not give as much information.\n - ""plate"" -> contains E -> excluded\n - ""blast"" -> avoid: has S,T,L,B,A -> let\'s check: B,L,A,S,T. This avoids the excluded letters.\n\n Word: ""blast""\n   Positions: B(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)\n\n However, note that in the previous feedback, A was not in position 3. But here we put A in position 3? That would be against the feedback?\n Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot place A in position 3 again.\n\n Therefore, we must put A in a position that isn\'t 3.\n\n Alternative words:\n\n Let\'s try to put A in position 1: \n   Example: ""adios"" -> contains D,I,O,S. But we don\'t know if D,I,O,S are safe? \n   But note: we want to test new letters.\n\n However, ""adios"" contains S and O, which are common.\n\n Another idea: ""about"" -> contains B,O,U,T. But we don\'t know about these letters.\n\n How about ""stamp""? \n   - S,T,A,M,P. \n   - A is in position 3? -> but we know A is not in position 3. So we cannot put A in position 3 again.\n   So move A to a different position.\n\n We can try ""patsy"": \n   - P(1), A(2), T(3), S(4), Y(5) -> A is in position 2.\n\n Avoid any word that has A in position 3.\n\n Also, avoid C,R,N,E.\n\n Another good candidate: ""aisle"" -> contains E? Yes -> excluded.\n\n Avoid E.\n\n So, let\'s try ""salty"": \n   - S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5): \n   A is in position 2 -> good because it was not in position 3 and we avoid placing it in 3.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if S,L,T,Y are in the word? We want to test.\n\n Another: ""valid"": contains V,A,L,I,D -> avoids C,R,N,E. \n   Positions: V(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), D(5) -> A in position 2.\n\n However, note that we haven\'t tested T,S,H,O,M,P etc.\n\n Since we excluded four letters (C,R,N,E) and know A is one letter, we have 21 letters left? Actually, 26-5=21 letters available.\n\n We need to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n Considering commonality: T is very frequent, S is frequent, etc.\n\n So words like ""taffy"" -> repeated F, bad. \n\n How about ""bails""? \n   B(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> A in position 2, avoids E, avoids C,R,N, and introduces B,I,L,S.\n\n Also, we are testing 4 new letters: B,I,L,S.\n\n However, note position 3: I? We have no information about that.\n\n Alternatively, ""daisy"": \n   D(1),A(2),I(3),S(4),Y(5) -> similar, introduces D,I,S,Y and A.\n\n Both seem okay.\n\n But note: we must avoid E? yes. Both avoid.\n\n Another idea: ""basil"" -> \n   B(1),A(2),S(3),I(4),L(5) -> again A in position 2.\n\n However, we have to consider that the secret word might have an A in position 1,2,4,5.\n\n We need to test positions differently? \n\n Since we know A is present and not in position 3, testing it in position 2 (for example) will help us determine if that\'s its spot or not.\n\n Alternatively, we might avoid position 2 as well? Not necessary, because we don\'t have a reason to avoid position 2. The previous feedback didn\'t rule out any position for A except position 3.\n\n So, let\'s go with a word that has A in a new position (like 2) and tests many common letters.\n\n ""BASAL"" -> repeated A, avoid.\n\n ""BASIL"": \n   Letters: B, A, S, I, L -> all distinct. And A in position 2? Actually, in ""basil"" the positions are:\n   B-A-S-I-L? Wait, no: \n   Position 1: B\n   Position 2: A\n   Position 3: S\n   Position 4: I\n   Position 5: L\n\n But wait, the word ""basil"" is 5 letters? Yes.\n\n However, note that ""salad"" has two A\'s and we avoid repeated to get more information. So ""basil"" with distinct letters is better.\n\n Alternatively, ""habit"": \n   H(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), T(5) -> A in position 2. \n\n Or ""macho"" -> but wait, M,A,C,H,O -> C is excluded? Yes! We cannot use C because it\'s excluded.\n\n So ""habit"": contains H,A,B,I,T -> avoids the excluded letters.\n\n Similarly, ""gawky"": G,A,W,K,Y -> avoids exclusions, but not very common? \n\n We should aim for words that use common consonants and vowels.\n\n Another choice: ""pastel"" -> contains E -> excluded.\n\n So between ""basil"", ""bails"", ""daisy"", ""habit"", etc.\n\n I think ""habit"" is good because it uses T and H, which are common. \n And it places A in position 2? But maybe the secret word has A in position 1,4,5? \n\n Actually, we are testing position 2: if we put A in position 2 and it is correct, then we know. If not, then we know A is not in position 2 either? \n\n Alternatively, we could test A in a different position to get more coverage? \n\n For example, testing A in position 1 or 4 or 5. \n\n Let me try to get A not in position 2 or 3.\n\n How about ""piano"" -> contains O, but also A in position 3? -> but we cannot place A in position 3.\n\n ""piano"" has A at position 3 -> invalid because we know A isn\'t in position 3.\n\n So words with A at positions 1,2,4,5.\n\n Position 1: ""adult"", ""abyss"", etc... but ""abyss"" has repeated S? So not distinct.\n\n Similarly, ""agile"" -> contains E? excluded.\n\n ""daily"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> A in position 2? Wait: \n   D(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5) -> A in position 2.\n\n Same as before.\n\n How about putting A in position 4? \n   Example: ""spade"" -> contains E? excluded.\n\n Without E: ""draft"" -> D(1), R(2), A(3), F(4), T(5) -> A in position 3? Invalid.\n\n ""focal"" -> contains C? excluded.\n\n ""latch"" -> L(1), A(2), T(3), C(4), H(5) -> C excluded? yes.\n\n It\'s tricky.\n\n Another word with A at position 4: ""ultra"" -> \n   U(1), L(2), T(3), R(4), A(5) -> but R is excluded? We got R: x in the first guess.\n\n So we can\'t use R.\n\n Put A at position 5: \n   ""mania"" -> repeated A? and also contains N? which is excluded.\n\n ""scuba"" -> S(1), C(2), U(3), B(4), A(5) -> contains C? excluded.\n\n ""vodka"" -> V(1), O(2), D(3), K(4), A(5) -> avoids excluded letters? \n   Check: excluded are C,R,N,E -> V,O,D,K,A (A is allowed) -> V,O,D,K are new.\n\n But we know A is present, so we must include A anyway? Yes, but we are putting A at position 5.\n\n Alternatively, ""tidal"": \n   T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5) -> A at position 4? \n   But ""tidal"" has L at the end? Yes.\n\n Now we test A at position 4.\n\n Similarly, ""viral"" -> but contains R? excluded.\n\n So ""tidal"": \n   Letters: T, I, D, A, L -> avoids excluded letters? \n   T, I, D, A, L -> none of them are C,R,N,E? Good.\n\n But note: we tested A in position 4? \n\n However, ""tidal"" uses T, I, D, A, L.\n\n Another alternative: ""staid"": \n   S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5) -> but A is in position 3? which we know is not allowed.\n\n Therefore, for guess 2:\n\n Option 1: ""TIDAL"" (with A at 4) \n   -> T(1), I(2), D(3), A(4), L(5)\n\n Option 2: ""BASIL"" (with A at 2) \n   -> B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), L(5)\n\n Both introduce common letters.\n\n Considering letter frequency: \n   T is very common, S is very common, L and I are common too.\n\n So both words are good. \n\n However, note that we also want to test letters that might be in the word. Since the first guess only gave us one letter (A) present, we have four more to find.\n\n We decide: Let\'s go with ""tidal"" because it places A in a position we haven\'t tested (position 4). The previous guess had A in position 3? We know that was wrong, so testing A in position 4 might be better than position 2? \n\n Actually, testing the same letter in a different position is good if that position is likely.\n\n But we don\'t have much information, so it\'s arbitrary.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that also tests vowels that we haven\'t checked? \n\n We know E is out? So vowels remaining: A is already known. Then: I, O, U? \n\n We haven\'t tested O or U? But I is in both ""tidal"" and ""basil"".\n\n How about ""audio""? \n   - A(1), U(2), D(3), I(4), O(5) \n   - Avoids exclusions? \n   - But we know A is present, and we put it in position 1? \n   - Also, we test U, D, I, O.\n\n And all distinct letters? Yes.\n\n Also, we avoid the excluded letters: no C,R,N,E.\n\n Let\'s consider ""audio"":\n   - Tests A at position 1? \n   - Tests U, D, I, O.\n\n Since we know A is in the word, putting it at position 1 might give us more information? \n\n Then let\'s compare:\n\n Option 3: ""AUDIO"" -> which is a classical starting word? \n\n But we already made one guess.\n\n ""AUDIO"" has A at position 1: might be correct? Or it might not.\n\n Now, comparing the choices:\n\n - ""AUDIO"": \n     Letters: A, U, D, I, O -> tests vowels and D? And positions: we haven\'t seen position 1? \n\n - ""BASIL"": \n     Letters: B,A,S,I,L -> consonants B,S,L and vowels A,I.\n\n - ""TIDAL"": \n     Letters: T,I,D,A,L -> similar to AUDIO? But T/L instead of U/O.\n\n Actually, ""tidal"" has T and D? So quite different.\n\n Since we are more in the dark? But we have the constraint on A: it cannot be in position 3.\n\n So ""audio"": \n   Positions: A(1), U(2), D(3), I(4), O(5)\n\n Let me see if ""audio"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n It tests:\n   A in position 1 (was previously tested in position 3 and was wrong? Now we test if it is in position 1).\n   Plus we test U,D,I,O.\n\n The feedback might be very informative.\n\n But note: if A is not in position 1, then we get a \'-\' for A? Then we know A must be in position 4 or 5? (or 2? but we put U at 2) \n\n Actually, we test position 1 for A? If it\'s not correct, then A must be in one of the positions: 2,4,5? \n\n But wait, in the word ""audio"", the positions: \n   If A is in the secret word but not in position 1, then it must be in position 2? But we put U at 2. Or in position 4? We have I at 4? Or position 5? We have O at 5. \n\n Since the letters in positions 2,4,5 are all unique? Yes, so if A is in the word but not at 1, then it might show as in position 2? but actually we have U at 2, etc. \n\n Actually: the feedback will tell us if A is present? We already know it\'s in the word, so the feedback symbol for A will be either:\n   - ✓ if it is in the correct position? Then position 1 is green.\n   - - if it is in the word but in a different position? Then we know A is not in position 1.\n\n Similarly, for other letters.\n\n So I think ""audio"" is a good guess for the second attempt.\n\n But note: we are testing only one vowel? Actually, we test A,U,I,O? Quite vowel-heavy? But vowels are important.\n\n However, the secret word might have only one vowel? But A is already one, and we are testing two more? \n\n Given that five-letter words usually have several vowels, it\'s okay.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""tidal"" to test T and D? \n\n Considering frequency of letters? We have excluded E, which is very frequent. Then T is the most frequent letter? \n\n So testing T might be important.\n\n Therefore, let me propose:\n\n Option 4: ""TOAST"" -> but repeated T? and A at position 3? Not allowed.\n\n How about ""LASTS""? -> repeated S? and A at position 2? But we haven\'t tested S,L? \n\n But ""lasts"" has repeated S: not ideal.\n\n Then, let\'s choose ""tidal"" or ""audio""?\n\n Since T is so common, maybe ""tidal"" is better? \n\n But ""tidal"" also introduces T? \n\n Actually, both ""audio"" and ""tidal"" have distinct letters, so they are equally good? \n\n Let me choose ""audio"": \n   Why? Because it tests multiple vowels. Since the word contains A, which is a vowel, it might have other vowels? \n\n And if ""audio"" doesn\'t give us any additional letters? Then we know that U,D,I,O are absent? \n\n But also, we get positional information.\n\n Alternatively, I found ""paint"": \n   P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> contains N? Excluded -> invalid.\n\n ""light"": doesn\'t have A? We must include A because we know it\'s present? Otherwise we waste? \n\n Yes, we know A is in the word? So if we don\'t include A in the guess, we won\'t get feedback about its position? \n\n And we still need to locate A.\n\n Therefore, we must include A.\n\n So back to including A: words like ""audio"", ""basil"", ""tidal"", ""habit"", etc.\n\n I\'ll go with ""audio"".<thinking>\nThe feedback from the first guess ""crane"" provided critical information:\n- C, R, N, and E are not in the word at all (marked ""x"").\n- A is in the word but not in the third position (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Since A must be present, it should be included but not in position 3.\n- Avoid C, R, N, E entirely, as they have been eliminated.\n- Test new common letters to maximize information gain, prioritizing other vowels and consonants.\n- Position A in a different spot—position 1, 2, 4, or 5—to narrow down its location.\n\nConsidering words that meet these criteria:\n- ""AUDIO"" is a strong candidate: \n  - Includes A (position 1), avoiding position 3.\n  - Avoids C, R, N, E.\n  - Tests three new vowels (U, I, O) and one consonant (D), which are common and could reveal additional vowels or positional data.\n  - All distinct letters minimize redundancy.\n\nOther options like ""BASIL"" (A in position 2) or ""TIDAL"" (A in position 4) are also valid, but ""AUDIO"" efficiently tests multiple new vowels at once, leveraging the elimination of E to prioritize less frequent vowels (U, I, O). This could provide quick insights into vowel placement and frequency.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>audio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is in the word but not in position 3.\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.\n\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)\nMeaning:\n- A is in the word but not in positions 1 (since it was placed at position 1 in this guess) and not in position 3 (from previous). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5? But note, in ""audio"", A was in position 1 and we got a dash (-), meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 1. Similarly, O was given a dash, meaning O is in the word but not in position 5 (since we put O at position 5 in this guess) and not in position 4? Actually, for O: since we put it at position 5 and got a dash, it means O is in the word but not in position 5. Also, U and D and I are not in the word? Because they are marked x.\n\nAdditionally:\n- U is not in the word.\n- D is not in the word.\n- I is not in the word.\n- O is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nSo now we know:\n- Letters in the word: A and O? And we know two letters: A and O? But there could be more? Actually, we know A and O are present? And others? But we haven\'t found all.\n\nAlso, from guess 1: we only knew A? Then guess 2: O is added? And we eliminated U,D,I.\n\nSo now we have:\n- Present letters: A and O.\n- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I. (so far 7 letters excluded: C,R,N,E,U,D,I)\n\nThe word has 5 letters? So we have two known letters: A and O? And three unknown.\n\nBut note: O is only said to be present? And A is present? We don\'t know where.\n\nWe also know:\n- For A: it is not in position 1 (from audio) and not in position 3 (from crane). Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5? Actually, positions: \n    - In crane: A was tested at position 3? So avoid position 3.\n    - In audio: A was tested at position 1? So avoid position 1.\n    Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, for O: it is tested only in position 5 (in audio) and given dash? Meaning O is in the word? But not in position 5. \nWe haven\'t tested O at other positions? So O can be in any position except 5? And except where? We don\'t know? So O can be in position 1,2,3, or 4? But note: we have the positions: \n\nNow, we know O is in the word? But not in position 5. \n\nBut what positions are possible for O?\n- We haven\'t tested O elsewhere? So no other constraints? So O can be in positions 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nBut note: if O were in position 1, and we put A in position 1 in audio, why didn\'t we get O in position 1? We put U in position 2? Etc.? Actually, the feedback symbols: we got A at position 1: (-) meaning A is in the word but not at position 1? And O at position 5: (-) meaning O is in the word but not at position 5? And U,D,I: absent.\n\nSo we need to include both A and O in our next guess? And avoid excluded letters: C,R,N,E,U,D,I? And avoid placing A in positions 1 and 3? And avoid O in position 5.\n\nTherefore, our next guess must:\n- Include A and O? (since we know they are in the word? Yes? But are there more? We don\'t know? We have two confirmed letters? The word might have duplicates? But for now, we assume distinct? Because? Well, we haven\'t seen duplicates? But possible? But we can avoid duplicate letters? Actually, better to use distinct letters? So we include A and O? And we include three new letters? \n\nBut note: could the word have letters that we haven\'t guessed? Yes? So we have to consider.\n\nNow, positions:\nWe must place A in position 2, 4, or 5? And O in position 1,2,3, or 4? But avoid placing O in position 5? Already excluded.\n\nAlso, note that O and A might not be duplicates? So we cannot place them at the same position? (unless duplicates? but we avoid).\n\nTherefore, we have to choose positions for A and O? But also? We don\'t know the other letters? So we need to test new letters.\n\nNow, the word must? Have 5 letters? Two known? So three unknowns? \n\nSo potential word: we are guessing a word that has A and O? And avoid excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,N,E,U,D,I? So available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z, and we already have A and O? But we need to use three more?\n\nLet\'s also recall: frequent English consonants: L,S,T,B,P,M, etc.\n\nWe can try to form words that include A and O? And assign A to one of the positions: 2,4,5? And O to one of positions 1,2,3,4? And not overlapping? Unless duplicates? \n\nSince no duplication? Then assign distinct positions.\n\nPossible placements:\n\nIf A is in position 2? Then O cannot be in 2? So O in 1,3,4? \n\nSimilarly, A in position 4: O in 1,2,3? \nA in position 5: O in 1,2,3,4.\n\nAnd we don\'t know which? So we need to choose one.\n\nBut also? We want to test common letters? And avoid losing try? \n\nSo let me think of common words? \n\nExample: ""LOCAL""? -> contains C? Excluded? C is excluded? So invalid.\n\n""BOOST""? -> contains O twice? and E? E excluded? But also? Has E? No? Boost: B,O,O,S,T? Not distinct? And has repeated O? And no A? Must have A.\n\nSo must include A? \n\n""ABOUT""? -> contains U? Excluded? U is excluded? From audio feedback? We know U is not in word? So avoid.\n\n""MANGO"": contains M,A,N,G,O? But N excluded? N is excluded? So invalid.\n\n""SOLAR"": contains S,O,L,A,R? But R excluded? So invalid.\n\n""PLAIN"": contains L,A,I,N? But I and N excluded? Invalid.\n\nSo hard? \n\nHow about ""POLKA""? -> P,O,L,K,A? \nLetters: P,O,L,K,A? Avoids C,R,N,E,U,D,I? Yes? And positions: \nPosition 1: P\nPosition 2: O\nPosition 3: L\nPosition 4: K\nPosition 5: A\n\nNow, check for A: A is in position 5? Which is allowed? Because A can be in 2,4,5? So 5 is allowed.\nO is in position 2? Which is one of the positions? And not position 5? So O is fine? But wait, O not in position 5? Yes? And we have assigned O to 2? \n\nBut know? We must check: \nIs it possible that O could be in position 1? We haven\'t tested? But in ""audio"", we only tested O at position 5? So no? \n\nSimilarly, for A: in position 5? Which is one of the possibilities? \n\nBut wait: the secret word could have O in position 1? And we put O at position 2? Then we would get a dash? And similarly, A at 5? \n\nWith ""polka"": \n   Position: P(1), O(2), L(3), K(4), A(5)\n\nBut we have constraints? \nFor O: it is not in position 5? But here we put it at 2? Which is fine? Perhaps.\nAnd for A: not in 1 or 3? So at 5? Is allowed? \n\nBut note: what is the word? ""POLKA""? Is it a valid word? Yes? It means dance.\n\nWe introduce P,O,L,K,A? All distinct? And avoid excluded letters? Yes? \n\nSo let\'s use that.\n\nBut note: we are testing positions? But could we get information? Yes? \n\nIf we get:\n   If O is actually in position 2? Then we get O(✓)? But we don\'t know?\n   Similarly, if A is actually in position 5? Then A(✓)? \n\nBut the word might not be POLKA? But we are choosing a guess to get feedback? \n\nAlternatively, we could arrange the positions differently? For example, putting O at position 1? And A at position 4? \n\nThen word: ""OASIS""? -> repeated S? and doesn\'t avoid? But O(1),A(2),S(3)...? But S? Then I? Excluded? Invalid.\n\n""OSCAR""? -> contains C? Excluded.\n\n""JOKER""? -> contains E and R? Excluded.\n\nSo ""POLKA"" seems good? \n\nBut note: we have to include both A and O? And avoid constraints.\n\nAnother word: ""GLOAT""? \n   G,L,O,A,T? \n   Positions: \n      Position 1: G\n      Position 2: L\n      Position 3: O? \n      Position 4: A\n      Position 5: T\n\nNow, for A: we place at position 4? Which is allowed? And O at position 3? \nFor O: position 3 has not been tested? So it\'s possible? But we must avoid for A? A is at position 4? Which is fine? \nAnd O: O at position 3? \nBut we put O at position 3? And we haven\'t tested O at position 3 before? So we don\'t know? \n\nBut the word: G,L,O,A,T? Avoids exclusions? G,L,O,A,T -> no excluded letter? \n\nSimilarly good? \n\nBut ""gloat""? \n\nAlternatively, ""SPLAT""? \n   S,P,L,A,T? \n   Positions: \n      S(1), P(2), L(3), A(4), T(5)? \n   Then A at position 4? \n   But no O? We must include O? Because we know O is in the word? If we don\'t include O, we don\'t get feedback for O\'s position? And we waste a guess? \n\nSo we must include O? So ""SPLAT"" doesn\'t include O? \n\nTherefore, invalid? \n\nWe require the word to contain both A and O? \n\nSo words like ""POLKA"" or ""GLOAT""? Or ""CLOAK""? But ""cloak"" has C? Excluded.\n\nSo:\n\n""POLKA"": P,O,L,K,A -> positions: O at 2, A at 5? \n""GLOAT"": G,L,O,A,T -> positions: O at 3, A at 4? \n\nWhich one to choose? \n\nIn ""POLKA"":\n   O is at position 2? Which we haven\'t tested? \n   A is at position 5? Which we haven\'t tested? \n\nIn ""GLOAT"":\n   O is at position 3? \n   A is at position 4? \n\nWhat were previously restricted for A? \n   A: not at 1 or 3? Because: \n      In crane: A not at position 3? \n      In audio: A not at position 1? \n   So for A? Positions 2,4,5? \n   Position 3? Already tested and not? \n\nSimilarly, O has been tested only at position 5? Which we know not? So O can be at 1,2,3,4.\n\nIn ""POLKA"": \n   O at 2? And A at 5? So we test two positions: \n      O at position 2: if correct? ✓? Otherwise? \n      Also? We test new letters P,L,K? \n\nSimilarly? In ""GLOAT"": \n   O at 3? A at 4? Test G,L,T? \n\nBut note: we have also? Frequency? T is more frequent than K? \n\nHow about ""PASTA""? \n   P,A,S,T,A? Repeated A? Not good? \n   But also? Avoid O? Must include O.\n\nGiven that? \n\nI think either POLKA or GLOAT is fine? \n\nBut let me think? We can choose GLOAT? because it puts A in position 4 and O in position 3? \n\nWait? Position 3? We tested A at position 3? But not O? So O might be at position 3? \n\nSimilarly? In POLKA? We put O at position 2? Which might be correct? \n\nArbitrary? Then let\'s pick GLOAT? \n\nBut try? \n\nAlternatively? ""SHOAL""? \n   S,H,O,A,L? \n   Positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), A(4), L(5)? \n   Then avoid? \n   Letters: S,H,O,A,L -> avoids exclusions? \n   O at position 3? A at position 4? \n\nAnd we introduce S,H,L? \n\nAnother: ""FLORA""? But R excluded? \n\n""BLOKA"": maybe not a word? \n\nSo let me choose ""SHOAL""? \n\nSHOAL: S at position 1? But we haven\'t tested S? \n\nOr GLOAT: G,L,O,A,T -> O at 3? A at 4.\n\nTo decide? Note? In ""audio"" we tried U (position 2) and D (position 3) and I (position 4) and got x? So we know position 2 doesn\'t have U? Position 3 doesn\'t have D? Position 4 doesn\'t have I? \n\nBut we don\'t know what letters? At those positions? \n\nSo for position 2? We know U is not there? But what about? In POLKA? O at 2? So we test O at position 2? \n\nIn GLOAT? Position 2: L? \n\nBoth? \n\nBut since O can be anywhere? \n\nAlso? We want to maximize information? \n\nPerhaps GLOAT? Because it tests L? \n\nBut I\'ll go with POLKA? Because? \n\nWait? Another possibility: since we have excluded many vowels? U,I? And E? Then vowels left? Usually words have vowels? So O and A? And maybe Y? For now? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nNow? I think we choose? \n\nBut note: using a word that has O and A? And common consonants? \n\nSo ""POLKA"" and ""GLOAT"" are both fine? \n\nThen let\'s choose ""GLOAT""? \n\nOr ""CROAK"": C excluded.\n\nI\'ll pick ""GLOAT""? \n\nGuess: GLOAT? \n\nBut wait? Let me check: \n\nWith GLOAT? \n   G(1), L(2), O(3), A(4), T(5)\n\nNow, the constraints:\n   A must be at 2,4,5? Here at 4? Which is okay? \n   Must avoid placing A at 1? \n   O must not be at 5? Here at 3? Not 5? Okay? \n\nAnd letters: G,L,O,A,T? Avoids C,R,N,E,U,D,I? \n\nYes? \n\nBut note: we don\'t know if G,L,T are in the word? So we test? \n\nTherefore? Guess: GLOAT? \n\nAlternatively? Let me think of ""ATOLL""? \n   A(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), L(5)? Repeated L? Not distinct? \n\nSo not optimal? \n\nTherefore? GLOAT or POLKA? \n\nI\'ll go with GLOAT? \n\nSecond thought: POLKA puts O at position 2 and A at 5? Which are two different possibilities? \n\nIn GLOAT: O at 3 and A at 4? \n\nBoth are okay? \n\nBut note? Position 3: O? We haven\'t tested O at 3? But we have tested A at position 3? But not the same letter? \n\nSo no problem? \n\nSo I guess: GLOAT? \n\nBut? Another word? ""BOAST""? \n   B(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5)? \n   But O at 2? A at 3? \n   But for A: position 3 was tested in crane? And we got A was present? But not at position 3? And we are trying A at position 3 again? Oh! But no: we know A is not at position 3? From the first guess? \n\nIn BOAST? If I put A at position 3? Then? The feedback would say x? Because A is in the word? But not at position 3? So why put A there? It will give dash? But we already know? \n\nActually? In guess 1? Crane? Position 3: A -> dash? Meaning A is present but not at position 3? \n\nTherefore? In BOAST? If I put A at position 3? Then we will get dash? Meaning same as before? So we learn nothing? \n\nTherefore? We must avoid placing A at position 3? Because we already know it is not there? And for O? Position 5 we tested? Not? \n\nSo BOAST: \n   Position 3: A? Not allowed? So we must avoid? Therefore? BOAST is invalid? \n\nWhereas? GLOAT: A at position 4? Which is fine? \n\nSimilarly? POLKA: A at 5? Fine? \n\nBut using A? Which we know? At a new position? \n\nSo I think GLOAT is good? \n\nTherefore? Next guess: GLOAT? \n\nBut wait? What is the feedback we got so far? \n\nActually? In audio?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning: 
  - A is in the word but not at position 3.
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
Meaning:
  - A is in the word but not at position 1.
  - O is in the word but not at position 5.
  - U, D, I are not in the word.

Guess 3: gloat -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(-) O(✓) A(✓) T(x)
Meaning:
  - O is in the word and at position 3 (since we put O at position 3 and got ✓).
  - A is in the word and at position 4 (since we put A at position 4 and got ✓).
  - L is in the word but not at position 2 (since we put L at position 2 and got -).
  - G and T are not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has:
   - Position 3: O (since O is correct in position 3)
   - Position 4: A (since A is correct in position 4)
  So the word is _ _ O A _
- Additionally, L is in the word but not at position 2 (so L must be in position 1 or 5? Because the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5 and positions 3 and 4 are fixed? So L must be in position 1, 2, or 5? But we put L at position 2 and it was not correct? So L cannot be in position 2? Therefore, L must be in position 1 or 5? 

But wait? The feedback for L in gloat: L at position 2 -> dash (-) meaning L is present but not at position 2? So L must be in positions 1 or 5? Since positions 3 and 4 are taken.

- Also, excluded letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, G, T? From all feedback? 
  From guess 1: C,R,N,E
  From guess 2: U,D,I
  From guess 3: G,T

  So excluded: C,R,N,E,U,D,I,G,T (9 letters)

- And we know the word has exactly the letters: 
   - O, A, L? And two more? Because five letters? So two more unknown letters.

  The known letters: O (at pos3), A (at pos4), L (somewhere? position 1 or 5?).

Plus two more letters? 

Also, the word has L? So L is one letter? And we have O and A? That's three? Then two missing?

But wait? Could there be duplicates? We haven't seen? But possible? However? In feedback? Only one O and one A? But L could be duplicated? But we haven't encountered? 

But for now? We proceed with distinct? 

Therefore? The word has three known letters: O, A, L? And two unknown? 

Now, positions:
   Position 3: O
   Position 4: A
   Position 1: either L? or a new letter?
   Position 2: must be a new letter? because L is not at position 2? And if we don't put L there? 
   Position 5: either L? or the other new letter?

But L can be only at position 1 or 5? 

Therefore? The word has the pattern: 
   Position 1: could be L or another letter?
   Position 2: a new letter? 
   Position 3: O
   Position 4: A
   Position 5: could be L or the same other letter? But if position 1 is L? Position 5 must be a new letter? And vice versa.

So both positions 1 and 5 must be filled? One is L? One is a new letter? And position 2 is a new letter? 

But? What if L is at position 1? Then position 5 must be a new letter? And position 2 is a new letter? 

Similarly? If L is at position 5? Then position 1 must be a new letter? And position 2 is a new letter? 

Therefore? We need to determine? Where L is? And what are the two new letters? 

But the available letters? 
   Excluded: C,R,N,E,U,D,I,G,T? So excluded: 9 letters.

Available: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z? And we have L, O, A? 

But O and A are fixed? 

So remaining letters: B,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,S,V,W,X,Y,Z? 16 letters? Then two new letters? 

We need to form a word? With pattern: 
   If L in position 1: L _ O A _ ? Then the letters: position 2: one letter? Position 5: one letter?
   Or L in position 5: _ _ O A L ? Then position 1 and 2: two letters? 

But also? Since L is in the word? And we know it must be at position 1 or 5? 

Let us list possible words:

First pattern: L * O A * 
   Where * for position 2: a letter? And position 5: a letter? From available.

Second pattern: * * O A L? 
   Position 1: a letter? Position 2: a letter? And then O, A, L at positions 3,4,5? 

We can consider common words? 

First? Pattern 1: L at position 1? 
   The word: L _ O A _ ? 
   Possible: 
      Let position 5 be a letter? Ex: ""S"" for position 5? Then L O A S? But we have position 2 to fill? 

   Words: 
      ""LOOAL""? Not valid? 
      ""LOWAY""? Not a word? 

   How about ""LOCAL""? But C excluded? 

   ""LOYAL"": - L O Y A L? But positions: 
        L at 1? Then O at position 3? We have position 3 O? Then Y at position 2? A at position 4? L at position 5? 
        So L at both 1 and 5? So repeated letters? 

   ""loyal"": letters: L,O,Y,A? But two L's? So letters: L,O,Y,A? 

   But if we have ""LOYAL"": 
        Position 1: L
        Position 2: O? Wait no? In ""LOYAL"": 
           Position 1: L
           Position 2: O
           Position 3: Y? But we need position 3: O? 
        The word is L-O-Y-A-L? So position 3: Y? It is not L O A? 

   Not matching? 

   How about ""LEGAL""? But E excluded? 

   Or ""LOAMY""? Not a word? 

   How about ""LOBAR""? But R excluded? 

   Not easy? 

Pattern 2: * * O A L? 
   So at position 5: L? Then pattern: _ _ O A L? 
   Possible words: 
      ""FROAL""? Not valid? 
      ""BROAD""? -> B,R,O,A,D? But R excluded? 
      ""CROAK""? C excluded? 
      ""WOAD"": short? 

   How about ""KOALA""? 
      K,O,A,A,L? Not 5 letters? And not pattern? 

   Actually? Common word? ""FOCAL""? -> F O C A L? But C excluded? 

   ""VOCAL"": V O C A L? C excluded? 

   ""MORAL"": M,O,R,A,L? R excluded? 

   Seems problematic? 

   Another: ""SOLAR""? S O L A R? But R excluded? Also? In SOLAR? Position 3: L? But we need O at position 3? 

   Wait? Pattern: _ _ O A L? Position 3: O? Position 4: A? Position 5: L? 

   So words: 
      Position 1: ? 
      Position 2: ? 

   And then O, A, L at positions 3,4,5. 

   Words: 
      ""STOAL""? Not word? 
      ""SHOAL"": S,H,O,A,L? 
          Position 1: S? 
          Position 2: H? 
          Position 3: O? 
          Position 4: A? 
          Position 5: L? 
          We are using L at position 5? Which is allowed? 

        ""SHOAL"" -> valid? meaning shallow area? 

        Also? Avoid excluded letters: S,H are available? 

   Similarly? ""BHOOL"": not word? 

   Or ""WHOAL"": not? 

   So ""SHOAL""? 

   Then? Is SHOAL a valid guess? 
      Pattern: S H O A L? 
      Position 3: O -> matches
      Position 4: A -> matches
      Position 5: L -> and we know L is present? And we put it at position 5? 

   But in gloat? We got L(-)? meaning L is not in position 2? But position 5? We haven't tested? So possible? 

   What about the L constraint? L can only be? At position 1 or 5? We haven't tested position 5 for L? So position 5 is okay? 

   And S and H? Are they tried? H is new? S is new? 

   Therefore? SHOAL is a candidate? 

   Alternatively? ""DOALS"": not? 

   Or ""KOPAL"": K O P A L? But pattern: K at 1? O at 2? But we have O at position 3? So only if position 3 is O? Then K O P A L? Would have O at position 2? But pattern requires position 3 O? 

   Therefore? Only words with position 3 O? position 4 A? position 5 L? 

   And position 1 and 2: fill? 

   Words: SHOAL? 
          ALSOAL? not? 

   How about ""SWOAL""? Not standard? 

   ""SMOAL"": not? 

   So SHOAL seems good? 

   But note? In SHOAL? The letter L is at position 5? And in gloat? We tested L at position 2? And got dash? Meaning L is elsewhere? So position 5 is possible? 

   Also? In SHOAL? We have S and H? Where? 
        Position 1: S? 
        Position 2: H? 

   Both new? 

   But we know? From feedback? We have not tested S and H? 

   Therefore? SHOAL: S,H,O,A,L? 

   And the word must be ? 

   But wait? The pattern: Position 3: O? Position 4: A? Position 5: L? Then position 1: S? Position 2: H? 

But is L necessarily at position 5? Not? It could be at position 1? But in this guess? We are putting L at position 5? Which would be a possibility? 

But in the word SHOAL? What is the actual positions? 
   S(1), H(2), O(3), A(4), L(5)

Yes? 

But what about the L? 
   We are using L at position 5? So if the secret word has L at position 5? Then we will get ✓ for L? 

If not? Then we will know L must be at position 1? But we are putting S? So must test? 

Also? We have two words possible? 
   Pattern with L at 1: L . O A .
   Pattern with L at 5: . . O A L

For the pattern L . O A .? 
   The letter at position 2: let's call it X? 
   At position 5: Y? 

Then the word: L, X, O, A, Y? and X and Y from available letters? 

Possible words? 
   ""LOTAS""? Not? 
   ""LOBAR"": but R excluded? 
   ""LOVAT"": L O V A T? But T excluded? 

   ""LOYAL"": does not match because position 3? Not O? 

   How about ""LOCAL""? But C excluded? 

   ""LOGIA"": L O G I A? But G excluded? and I excluded? 

   So difficult? 

   Perhaps not many words? 

But SHOAL fits the pattern L at 5?

Therefore? We propose SHOAL? 

But note? The feedback from gloat? We got L(-)? So L must be in the word? But not at position 2? Since we guessed gloat? L at position 2? 

Now? We decide to test L at position 5? With SHOAL? 

So guess: shoal? 

If it matches? We win? 

If not? Then we know L must be at position 1? Then the word would be L * O A *? And we have 2 more tries? 

But also? In the feedback? We will get: for SHOAL? 
   S at position 1? If correct? ✓? Or if L is at position 1? Then S at position 1 would not be? 

Actually? In SHOAL? 
   Position 1: S? 
   Position 2: H? 
   Position 3: O -> ✓? 
   Position 4: A -> ✓? 
   Position 5: L? -> then if L is at position 5? ✓? 

But if L is not at position 5? Then the word must have L at position 1? So the secret word? Has position 1: L? Then S at position 1? Should not be present? But wait? 

Actually? The feedback would be? 

For example? If the word is LOAMY (if it were) but not valid? 

But suppose the word is L O V A H? Then? 
   Position 1: L? Then S at position 1: not L? So S should be x? 
   Position 2: H? In such word? Position 2: O? But in SHOAL? Position 2: H? Then in this hypothetical word? Position 2: O? Then H? Probably absent? 

So we can infer. 

Therefore? It's okay to guess SHOAL? 

But maybe there is a better word? 

Another candidate? For the pattern _ _ O A L? 

What about ""BROAL""? Not valid? 

So SHOAL? 

Or ""WOALD""? 

But SHOAL is common? 

Therefore? I choose SHOAL. 

Alternatively? Since we know positions 3 and 4? Are fixed? And L must be in 1 or 5? We can guess a word that does not repeat and maximizes new letters? 

We have only two possibilities for L? Either in 1 or 5? 

So if we guess SHOAL? 
   It assumes L is at position 5? If we get all? Then done? Otherwise? We know L must be in position 1? 

For next guess? If not? Then we must try L at position 1? 

But with 6 tries? We can do that. 

Therefore? Let's guess SHOAL.
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is present (but not in position 3). C, R, N, E absent.
- **Guess 2 (audio)**:  
  - A is present (but not in position 1).  
  - O is present (but not in position 5).  
  - U, D, I absent.
- **Guess 3 (gloat)**:  
  - **O is correct at position 3 (✓)**.  
  - **A is correct at position 4 (✓)**.  
  - L is present (but not in position 2).  
  - G and T absent.

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 3: **O**  
  - Position 4: **A**  
  ⇒ Secret word pattern: `_ _ O A _`
- **Present letters**:  
  - **L** must be in position 1 or 5 (since it can't be in position 2, and positions 3–4 are occupied by O/A).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, G, T (9 letters excluded).
- Remaining unknown: One letter for position 1/5 (depending on L) and one for position 2.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test L in position 5 (since position 1 is still untested) while filling position 2 with a new common consonant.  
- Include **L** at position 5 to verify its placement.  
- Use **S** and **H** (high-frequency consonants not tested yet) for positions 1–2.  
- **""SHOAL""** (S, H, O, A, L) fits perfectly:  
  - O and A remain fixed at positions 3–4.  
  - Tests L at position 5 (if correct, L is confirmed; if not, L must be at position 1).  
  - Tests new letters S (position 1) and H (position 2).  

<guess>shoal</guess>",shoal,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning: 
  - A is in the word but not at position 3.
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
Meaning:
  - A is in the word but not at position 1.
  - O is in the word but not at position 5.
  - U, D, I are not in the word.

Guess 3: gloat -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(-) O(✓) A(✓) T(x)
Meaning:
  - O is in the word and at position 3 (since we put O at position 3 and got ✓).
  - A is in the word and at position 4 (since we put A at position 4 and got ✓).
  - L is in the word but not at position 2 (since we put L at position 2 and got -).
  - G and T are not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has:
   - Position 3: O (since O is correct in position 3)
   - Position 4: A (since A is correct in position 4)
  So the word is _ _ O A _
- Additionally, L is in the word but not at position 2 (so L must be in position 1 or 5? Because the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5 and positions 3 and 4 are fixed? So L must be in position 1, 2, or 5? But we put L at position 2 and it was not correct? So L cannot be in position 2? Therefore, L must be in position 1 or 5? 

But wait? The feedback for L in gloat: L at position 2 -> dash (-) meaning L is present but not at position 2? So L must be in positions 1 or 5? Since positions 3 and 4 are taken.

- Also, excluded letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, G, T? From all feedback? 
  From guess 1: C,R,N,E
  From guess 2: U,D,I
  From guess 3: G,T

  So excluded: C,R,N,E,U,D,I,G,T (9 letters)

- And we know the word has exactly the letters: 
   - O, A, L? And two more? Because five letters? So two more unknown letters.

  The known letters: O (at pos3), A (at pos4), L (somewhere? position 1 or 5?).

Plus two more letters? 

Also, the word has L? So L is one letter? And we have O and A? That's three? Then two missing?

But wait? Could there be duplicates? We haven't seen? But possible? However? In feedback? Only one O and one A? But L could be duplicated? But we haven't encountered? 

But for now? We proceed with distinct? 

Therefore? The word has three known letters: O, A, L? And two unknown? 

Now, positions:
   Position 3: O
   Position 4: A
   Position 1: either L? or a new letter?
   Position 2: must be a new letter? because L is not at position 2? And if we don't put L there? 
   Position 5: either L? or the other new letter?

But L can be only at position 1 or 5? 

Therefore? The word has the pattern: 
   Position 1: could be L or another letter?
   Position 2: a new letter? 
   Position 3: O
   Position 4: A
   Position 5: could be L or the same other letter? But if position 1 is L? Position 5 must be a new letter? And vice versa.

So both positions 1 and 5 must be filled? One is L? One is a new letter? And position 2 is a new letter? 

But? What if L is at position 1? Then position 5 must be a new letter? And position 2 is a new letter? 

Similarly? If L is at position 5? Then position 1 must be a new letter? And position 2 is a new letter? 

Therefore? We need to determine? Where L is? And what are the two new letters? 

But the available letters? 
   Excluded: C,R,N,E,U,D,I,G,T? So excluded: 9 letters.

Available: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z? And we have L, O, A? 

But O and A are fixed? 

So remaining letters: B,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,S,V,W,X,Y,Z? 16 letters? Then two new letters? 

We need to form a word? With pattern: 
   If L in position 1: L _ O A _ ? Then the letters: position 2: one letter? Position 5: one letter?
   Or L in position 5: _ _ O A L ? Then position 1 and 2: two letters? 

But also? Since L is in the word? And we know it must be at position 1 or 5? 

Let us list possible words:

First pattern: L * O A * 
   Where * for position 2: a letter? And position 5: a letter? From available.

Second pattern: * * O A L? 
   Position 1: a letter? Position 2: a letter? And then O, A, L at positions 3,4,5? 

We can consider common words? 

First? Pattern 1: L at position 1? 
   The word: L _ O A _ ? 
   Possible: 
      Let position 5 be a letter? Ex: ""S"" for position 5? Then L O A S? But we have position 2 to fill? 

   Words: 
      ""LOOAL""? Not valid? 
      ""LOWAY""? Not a word? 

   How about ""LOCAL""? But C excluded? 

   ""LOYAL"": - L O Y A L? But positions: 
        L at 1? Then O at position 3? We have position 3 O? Then Y at position 2? A at position 4? L at position 5? 
        So L at both 1 and 5? So repeated letters? 

   ""loyal"": letters: L,O,Y,A? But two L's? So letters: L,O,Y,A? 

   But if we have ""LOYAL"": 
        Position 1: L
        Position 2: O? Wait no? In ""LOYAL"": 
           Position 1: L
           Position 2: O
           Position 3: Y? But we need position 3: O? 
        The word is L-O-Y-A-L? So position 3: Y? It is not L O A? 

   Not matching? 

   How about ""LEGAL""? But E excluded? 

   Or ""LOAMY""? Not a word? 

   How about ""LOBAR""? But R excluded? 

   Not easy? 

Pattern 2: * * O A L? 
   So at position 5: L? Then pattern: _ _ O A L? 
   Possible words: 
      ""FROAL""? Not valid? 
      ""BROAD""? -> B,R,O,A,D? But R excluded? 
      ""CROAK""? C excluded? 
      ""WOAD"": short? 

   How about ""KOALA""? 
      K,O,A,A,L? Not 5 letters? And not pattern? 

   Actually? Common word? ""FOCAL""? -> F O C A L? But C excluded? 

   ""VOCAL"": V O C A L? C excluded? 

   ""MORAL"": M,O,R,A,L? R excluded? 

   Seems problematic? 

   Another: ""SOLAR""? S O L A R? But R excluded? Also? In SOLAR? Position 3: L? But we need O at position 3? 

   Wait? Pattern: _ _ O A L? Position 3: O? Position 4: A? Position 5: L? 

   So words: 
      Position 1: ? 
      Position 2: ? 

   And then O, A, L at positions 3,4,5. 

   Words: 
      ""STOAL""? Not word? 
      ""SHOAL"": S,H,O,A,L? 
          Position 1: S? 
          Position 2: H? 
          Position 3: O? 
          Position 4: A? 
          Position 5: L? 
          We are using L at position 5? Which is allowed? 

        ""SHOAL"" -> valid? meaning shallow area? 

        Also? Avoid excluded letters: S,H are available? 

   Similarly? ""BHOOL"": not word? 

   Or ""WHOAL"": not? 

   So ""SHOAL""? 

   Then? Is SHOAL a valid guess? 
      Pattern: S H O A L? 
      Position 3: O -> matches
      Position 4: A -> matches
      Position 5: L -> and we know L is present? And we put it at position 5? 

   But in gloat? We got L(-)? meaning L is not in position 2? But position 5? We haven't tested? So possible? 

   What about the L constraint? L can only be? At position 1 or 5? We haven't tested position 5 for L? So position 5 is okay? 

   And S and H? Are they tried? H is new? S is new? 

   Therefore? SHOAL is a candidate? 

   Alternatively? ""DOALS"": not? 

   Or ""KOPAL"": K O P A L? But pattern: K at 1? O at 2? But we have O at position 3? So only if position 3 is O? Then K O P A L? Would have O at position 2? But pattern requires position 3 O? 

   Therefore? Only words with position 3 O? position 4 A? position 5 L? 

   And position 1 and 2: fill? 

   Words: SHOAL? 
          ALSOAL? not? 

   How about ""SWOAL""? Not standard? 

   ""SMOAL"": not? 

   So SHOAL seems good? 

   But note? In SHOAL? The letter L is at position 5? And in gloat? We tested L at position 2? And got dash? Meaning L is elsewhere? So position 5 is possible? 

   Also? In SHOAL? We have S and H? Where? 
        Position 1: S? 
        Position 2: H? 

   Both new? 

   But we know? From feedback? We have not tested S and H? 

   Therefore? SHOAL: S,H,O,A,L? 

   And the word must be ? 

   But wait? The pattern: Position 3: O? Position 4: A? Position 5: L? Then position 1: S? Position 2: H? 

But is L necessarily at position 5? Not? It could be at position 1? But in this guess? We are putting L at position 5? Which would be a possibility? 

But in the word SHOAL? What is the actual positions? 
   S(1), H(2), O(3), A(4), L(5)

Yes? 

But what about the L? 
   We are using L at position 5? So if the secret word has L at position 5? Then we will get ✓ for L? 

If not? Then we will know L must be at position 1? But we are putting S? So must test? 

Also? We have two words possible? 
   Pattern with L at 1: L . O A .
   Pattern with L at 5: . . O A L

For the pattern L . O A .? 
   The letter at position 2: let's call it X? 
   At position 5: Y? 

Then the word: L, X, O, A, Y? and X and Y from available letters? 

Possible words? 
   ""LOTAS""? Not? 
   ""LOBAR"": but R excluded? 
   ""LOVAT"": L O V A T? But T excluded? 

   ""LOYAL"": does not match because position 3? Not O? 

   How about ""LOCAL""? But C excluded? 

   ""LOGIA"": L O G I A? But G excluded? and I excluded? 

   So difficult? 

   Perhaps not many words? 

But SHOAL fits the pattern L at 5?

Therefore? We propose SHOAL? 

But note? The feedback from gloat? We got L(-)? So L must be in the word? But not at position 2? Since we guessed gloat? L at position 2? 

Now? We decide to test L at position 5? With SHOAL? 

So guess: shoal? 

If it matches? We win? 

If not? Then we know L must be at position 1? Then the word would be L * O A *? And we have 2 more tries? 

But also? In the feedback? We will get: for SHOAL? 
   S at position 1? If correct? ✓? Or if L is at position 1? Then S at position 1 would not be? 

Actually? In SHOAL? 
   Position 1: S? 
   Position 2: H? 
   Position 3: O -> ✓? 
   Position 4: A -> ✓? 
   Position 5: L? -> then if L is at position 5? ✓? 

But if L is not at position 5? Then the word must have L at position 1? So the secret word? Has position 1: L? Then S at position 1? Should not be present? But wait? 

Actually? The feedback would be? 

For example? If the word is LOAMY (if it were) but not valid? 

But suppose the word is L O V A H? Then? 
   Position 1: L? Then S at position 1: not L? So S should be x? 
   Position 2: H? In such word? Position 2: O? But in SHOAL? Position 2: H? Then in this hypothetical word? Position 2: O? Then H? Probably absent? 

So we can infer. 

Therefore? It's okay to guess SHOAL? 

But maybe there is a better word? 

Another candidate? For the pattern _ _ O A L? 

What about ""BROAL""? Not valid? 

So SHOAL? 

Or ""WOALD""? 

But SHOAL is common? 

Therefore? I choose SHOAL. 

Alternatively? Since we know positions 3 and 4? Are fixed? And L must be in 1 or 5? We can guess a word that does not repeat and maximizes new letters? 

We have only two possibilities for L? Either in 1 or 5? 

So if we guess SHOAL? 
   It assumes L is at position 5? If we get all? Then done? Otherwise? We know L must be in position 1? 

For next guess? If not? Then we must try L at position 1? 

But with 6 tries? We can do that. 

Therefore? Let's guess SHOAL.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is present (but not in position 3). C, R, N, E absent.
- **Guess 2 (audio)**:  
  - A is present (but not in position 1).  
  - O is present (but not in position 5).  
  - U, D, I absent.
- **Guess 3 (gloat)**:  
  - **O is correct at position 3 (✓)**.  
  - **A is correct at position 4 (✓)**.  
  - L is present (but not in position 2).  
  - G and T absent.

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 3: **O**  
  - Position 4: **A**  
  ⇒ Secret word pattern: `_ _ O A _`
- **Present letters**:  
  - **L** must be in position 1 or 5 (since it can't be in position 2, and positions 3–4 are occupied by O/A).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, G, T (9 letters excluded).
- Remaining unknown: One letter for position 1/5 (depending on L) and one for position 2.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test L in position 5 (since position 1 is still untested) while filling position 2 with a new common consonant.  
- Include **L** at position 5 to verify its placement.  
- Use **S** and **H** (high-frequency consonants not tested yet) for positions 1–2.  
- **""SHOAL""** (S, H, O, A, L) fits perfectly:  
  - O and A remain fixed at positions 3–4.  
  - Tests L at position 5 (if correct, L is confirmed; if not, L must be at position 1).  
  - Tests new letters S (position 1) and H (position 2).",Guess 4: shoal -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) O(✓) A(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
