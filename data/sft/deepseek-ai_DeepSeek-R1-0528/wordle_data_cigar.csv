We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it's marked as wrong position).
 - A is in the word but not in position 3.
 - N is not in the word at all.
 - E is not in the word at all.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word starts with C (position 1).
 - The secret word contains R, but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5).
 - The secret word contains A, but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 4 or 5, since position 1 is C).
 - The secret word does not contain N or E.

 Therefore, the word we are looking for is:
   C _ _ _ _

 And it has R and A somewhere in positions 2,3,4,5 but:
   - R is not in position 2 -> so R in 3,4, or 5.
   - A is not in position 3 -> so A in 4 or 5 (since position 2 is still open and we don't have A in position 2 yet? Actually, we don't know about position 2 for A? The feedback only says A is not in position 3, but it could be in 2? Wait, let me clarify.

 Important: The feedback for A says ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in the position we guessed, which was position 3. So A is not in position 3, but it could be in position 2, 4, or 5? But note: we don't have any information about position 2 yet.

 However, in the feedback for R: it was guessed in position 2 and we got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not there. So position 2 of the secret word is not R.

 Now, for A: we guessed it in position 3 and got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. It could be in position 2,4, or 5.

 But we also know the word does not have E or N.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that includes R and A (since they are in the word) and avoids N and E, and also the first letter must be C.

 So, our next guess should start with C, include R and A (but R not in position 2, A not in position 3), and not include N or E.

 We want to test possible positions for R and A, and also get information about the other letters.

 Let me think of words that fit:
   C _ _ _ _
   and the word must contain R and A.

 Possible positions:
   R can be in position 3,4,5.
   A can be in position 2,4,5 (but note: if A is in position 2, then it's the second letter).

 We also want to try to cover other common letters.

 Since we have two known letters (R and A) to place, and we don't know the other two letters.

 Let me consider words that start with C, have R and A, avoid N and E.

 Example: 
   ""CAR..."" but wait: in our first guess, we had ""crane"" and now we know A wasn't in position 3. But if we try ""C"" (fixed), second letter A? That's possible? 

 However, note: we haven't tested A in position 2. The feedback for ""crane"" says A is present but not in position 3. It could be in position 2. So let's try a word with A in position 2? But wait: that might conflict with R? We know R is present and cannot be in position 2.

 Another possibility: R in position 3 and A in position 4? Or R in position 4 and A in position 5? etc.

 I think a good second guess would be to try A in position 2 and R in a later position? But note: we know R cannot be in position 2, so if we put A in position 2, then R must be in 3,4,5.

 However, let me try to find words that start with C, have A in the second position? Examples: ""CAULK"", ""CATTY"", ""CABAL"", ""CARAT"", but wait:

 We must not use E or N. 

 Also, note: we haven't tested the other letters yet. Maybe we should avoid repeating the same letters? Actually, we need to include R because we know it's there.

 But if I put A in the second position, that would be: C A _ _ _

 Then for the remaining, we need R and two other letters (but no E or N).

 But wait: we don't know if A might be in position 2. So testing that would be useful.

 Alternative: We could try R in position 3 and A in another position. 

 Let me try to think of words:

 Option 1: Try A in position 2: 
   Word: C A _ _ _
   We must include R (in position 3,4, or 5). Also, we want to get information about the other letters.

 Example words: 
   ""CARD"" - but it's 4 letters? We need 5. 
   ""CARDS"" is 5 letters? But we have S? And D? 
   However, we don't know if D and S are in the word? 

 But note: we don't have feedback about D or S? So let's try:

   ""CAR"" + two more letters? 

   Possibilities: 
     ""CARAT"": C A R A T -> but has two A's? We only have one A? Wait, the secret word may have multiple same letters? We don't know yet.

 But in the feedback for ""crane"", we saw A only one time? However, the feedback symbol for A was only for the position we guessed. If there were two A's, we would have more than one A? Actually, the feedback only marks each position individually. So if there is an A elsewhere, it might not have been revealed? 

 However, in ""crane"", we guessed only one A (in position 3) so if there were two A's, the feedback for the other A would not appear because we didn't guess it? So we don't know if there are multiple A's? 

 So, we can use words that have R and A again? But we already know they are present? Maybe we need to check? 

 Actually, for the second guess, we should try to use letters we haven't tried yet? So we can get more information.

 We know the word has C (first) and contains R and A, and not E or N.

 We have tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so we know N and E are absent.

 We haven't tried: many other consonants and vowels (except A and R).

 Since there are 5 positions, we need to fill positions 2,3,4,5.

 We know:
   Position 1: C
   Position 2: cannot be R (from feedback on position2 of first guess), and we don't know what it is? So we want to test possible letters.

 Let me avoid using E and N again? But actually, we know they are absent? So we can avoid them? Or we can test them? But they are already known absent? So no need to re-use? 

 In fact, we should not use E or N because we know they are not in the word? Because if we use them again, they will get ""x"" and not give new information? So avoid E and N.

 So, for the second guess, we should pick a word that:
   - starts with C
   - has R and A in positions that are not forbidden (R not in 2, A not in 3) 
   - uses new letters (to maximize information)

 Let me consider: 
   Position 2: we can put a new letter? Or A? 

 If we put A in position 2? Then we test if it's there? That would be efficient? Because if it is, we get a match? Otherwise, we know it must be in position 4 or 5.

 Similarly, we can put R in a new position? 

 Let me try to build a word:

   Option: Put A in position 4? Then we can test that? And R in position 5? 

   Example: C _ _ A R

   What letters for position 2 and 3? We need to pick letters we haven't tried? 

   Letters we've already tried: C, R, A, N, E. So to get new information, use others.

   Let me pick common consonants: S, T, L, etc.? 

   Word: C L T A R? That's not a word? 

   Word: C H A R M? But note: we cannot put A in position 3? Because the feedback said A is not in position 3? We guessed it in position 3 and it was wrong? So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it's wrong? So why waste? 

   So we should avoid putting A in position 3? Similarly, avoid R in position 2? 

   Therefore, in the second guess, we avoid:
      Position 2: R? (because we know it's not R)
      Position 3: A? (because we know it's not A there)

   So for the second guess, we can try:

        Position 1: C (fixed)
        Position 2: a new letter? (not R, and we are unsure about A? But we can try A? but if we try A in position2 and it turns out to be there, that's good? If not, then we know A must be in 4 or 5? Either way we get information?).

        Why not try A in position2? That will directly tell us if A is in the second position? 

        If we do that:

          Word: C A ? ? ?

          And we must have R? somewhere in 3,4,5? And also, we want to test two more letters? 

          And for the other positions, we avoid E and N? And use new letters? 

          Example: ""CARAT"": 
            C A R A T? The A in the third position? We cannot put A in the third position? Because we know from previous feedback that A is not in position 3? So it would be incorrect? 

          So we can't double A? Or we can? But we don't know? Wait: if the word has two A's? Then we are allowed? But we have feedback: we guessed A in position3 and got a '-' meaning at least one A is present? But that doesn't tell us how many? So it could be multiple? 

          But if we put A in position3 again? And there is only one A? Then we would get an 'x'? But if there are two? Then we get a '-'? 

          However, we are less confident? 

          Alternatively: avoid A in position3? So don't test there? 

        So, let me choose a word that doesn't put A in position3? 

        Example: 
          ""CABAL"" -> C A B A L? This has A in position2 and position4? 
          But then we have two A's? 

        How about: ""CARTY""? Not a word? 

        Better: ""CARBS"" -> C A R B S? But here R is in position3? And we don't know if that's correct? 

        But note: we are allowed to put R in any position? But in the first guess, R was in position2? Now we want to test it elsewhere? 

        Let me see: 
          Word: C A R B S
          Would that be valid? 

        However, we are putting R in position3? That could be the correct position? 

        But wait: we don't know? We only know R is not in position2? 

        So using ""CARBS"" (if it's a word) should work? 

        But let me double-check: 
          CARBS: it's a word (plural of carb, carbohydrate).

        However, note: we have A in position2? If the secret word has A in position2? Then we get ✓? If not, then we know A must be in position4 or5? 

        So let's try ""CARBS"": 
          C A R B S

        Also, we are using B and S? Which are new? So we get information about B and S? 

        But note: avoid E and N? CARBS doesn't have E or N? 

        So ""carbs"" is a valid word? 

        However, what if the secret word doesn't have A in position2? Then our guess might be inefficient? 

        Alternatively, we might avoid A in position2? And put A in position4? For example, ""C_ _ A R""? 

        Example: ""C T L A R""? Not a word? 

        Or ""CHAFR""? Not a word.

        More common: ""COBRA"" -> but that starts with C, O, B, R, A? 
          C O B R A -> then A is in position5? 
          But note: we are putting O and B? 
          Also, R is in position4? 

        But in this word, we haven't put R in position2? And not A in position3? So okay? 

        However, we are not testing A in position2? 

        Maybe: ""CURLY"" -> C U R L Y? Then we have R in position3? But where is A? We skipped A? Wait, we know the word has A? But we need to test A? So we must include A? 

        So we cannot skip A? Because we know it's in the word? 

        Therefore, guess must include A? 

        So let's consider: ""COBRA"": 
          C O B R A -> includes A at the end (position5) and R at position4? 

        That seems okay? 

        But wait: let's compare:

          Option1: ""CARBS"": tests A in position2 and R in position3? And introduces B and S?
          Option2: ""COBRA"": tests O and B? and R in position4 and A in position5? 

        Which is better? 

        Since we have limited guesses? We want as much new information as possible? 

        With ""CARBS"": if the word has A in position2? Then we know? And we test R in position3? 
        With ""COBRA"": we test A in position5? But we don't know if A might be in position2? 

        And we have two new letters (O,B) instead of two (B,S)? 

        Also note: in ""crane"" we tested nothing? Only C,R,A (with R and A incorrect positions) and N, E absent? 

        But I think testing A in position2 is efficient? Because if it is there? Then we know? And we also put R in position3? 

        However, if it's not? Then we know A is in position4 or5? 

        The problem is: we have two letters to place: R and A? So any guess we make should aim to pin down their positions? 

        Also, note: the word must have C _ _ _ _? 

        After ""crane"", possible words? 

        Example: 
          ""C"" in position1, and then? 
          Possible words: 
            ""CATER""? no E -> excluded.
            ""CABIN""? no because has N -> excluded.
            ""CARRY"" -> has two R's? and Y? But no E or N? 
            ""CARRS""? Not common? 

        Or ""CHAIR"" -> has H and I? 

        But we don't know? 

        Given the constraints, let me go with ""CARBS""? 

        But wait: I must ensure that we are not violating the feedback? For ""CARBS"" our guess? 

        Positions:
          Position1: C -> should be ✓? 
          Position2: A -> could be ✓ or could be x? (if A is not there? We get '-' or 'x'? Actually, if A is in the word but in a different position? we get '-'? If not? Then we get x? But we know A is in the word? So we must get either ✓ (if in position2) or '-' (if not in position2 but present) ... wait, no: the feedback for a letter that is in the word but not in the guessed position gets '-'. If it's in the correct position, ✓. 

        So for position2 in ""CARBS"": 
          If the secret word has A in position2: ✓ for A? 
          Else: if A is in the word? then we get '-' for A? because we guessed it in position2? But wait? Actually, the feedback would mark:
            For position2: If A is not in position2? Then if the secret word has an A? then we get '-'? Because the letter A is in the word? So we will not get x? 

        So we will not get an x for A? because we know the word has A? 

        Therefore, guessing ""CARBS"" is safe? 

        But note: if the word has two A's? But we don't know? 

        However, the same applies: if we have A in position2 and it's correct? we get ✓? otherwise, if the word has an A not in that position? we get '-'? 

        So let's go with ""carbs"". 

        Alternatively, what about ""CARTY""? Not a word? Or ""CARTS"", which is a word? 

        ""CARTS"": C A R T S -> same as CARBS, but T instead of B? 

        Since both are common? 

        But I think CARBS is fine? 

        Another common word: ""CAROL""? -> but that has O and L? 

        But note: CAROL: C A R O L? Then R is in position3? and A in position2? 

        Same as CARBS? 

        However, CAROL does not avoid E? No, CAROL doesn't have E or N? 

        But we can choose any? 

        Let me stick with CARBS? 

        Or maybe ""CLARA""? -> C L A R A? Then A is in position3? which we are not supposed to? Because our first feedback said A is not in position3? So putting A in position3? We expect it to be wrong? 

        So avoid?

        Therefore: CARBS seems a good option? 

        Let me check if it's a valid word? Yes: ""carbs"" is the plural of carb? 

        So I'll go with ""carbs"". 

        But wait: what about avoiding letters that might be vowels? The secret word may have vowels? We have already ruled out E? And we have A? So remaining vowels: O, I, U? 

        CARBS has no vowels? Besides A? Well, A is vowel? And the rest are consonants? 

        But if we want to test vowels? Then ""CAROL"" might be better? 

        However, we are limited? 

        But I think CARBS is acceptable? 

 So my second guess: ""carbs""

<guess>carbs</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The first letter **C** is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- **R** is present in the word but not in position 2.
- **A** is present in the word but not in position 3.
- **N** and **E** are not in the word at all.

For the second guess, we need:
- The word to start with **C**.
- To include **R** and **A**, but avoid placing **R** in position 2 and **A** in position 3.
- To avoid using **N** and **E**.
- To test new potential letters for positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 while prioritizing common letters.

A strategic choice is ""carbs"": 
- It starts with **C**.
- It positions **A** in position 2 (testing if **A** belongs there).
- It positions **R** in position 3 (testing its correct placement).
- It introduces new common letters **B** and **S**.
- It follows feedback constraints: **R** not in position 2, **A** not in position 3, and avoids **N** and **E**.

This guess will help clarify the positions of **A** and **R** while providing new information about **B** and **S**.

<guess>carbs</guess>",carbs,"We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it's marked as wrong position).
 - A is in the word but not in position 3.
 - N is not in the word at all.
 - E is not in the word at all.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word starts with C (position 1).
 - The secret word contains R, but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5).
 - The secret word contains A, but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 4 or 5, since position 1 is C).
 - The secret word does not contain N or E.

 Therefore, the word we are looking for is:
   C _ _ _ _

 And it has R and A somewhere in positions 2,3,4,5 but:
   - R is not in position 2 -> so R in 3,4, or 5.
   - A is not in position 3 -> so A in 4 or 5 (since position 2 is still open and we don't have A in position 2 yet? Actually, we don't know about position 2 for A? The feedback only says A is not in position 3, but it could be in 2? Wait, let me clarify.

 Important: The feedback for A says ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in the position we guessed, which was position 3. So A is not in position 3, but it could be in position 2, 4, or 5? But note: we don't have any information about position 2 yet.

 However, in the feedback for R: it was guessed in position 2 and we got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not there. So position 2 of the secret word is not R.

 Now, for A: we guessed it in position 3 and got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. It could be in position 2,4, or 5.

 But we also know the word does not have E or N.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that includes R and A (since they are in the word) and avoids N and E, and also the first letter must be C.

 So, our next guess should start with C, include R and A (but R not in position 2, A not in position 3), and not include N or E.

 We want to test possible positions for R and A, and also get information about the other letters.

 Let me think of words that fit:
   C _ _ _ _
   and the word must contain R and A.

 Possible positions:
   R can be in position 3,4,5.
   A can be in position 2,4,5 (but note: if A is in position 2, then it's the second letter).

 We also want to try to cover other common letters.

 Since we have two known letters (R and A) to place, and we don't know the other two letters.

 Let me consider words that start with C, have R and A, avoid N and E.

 Example: 
   ""CAR..."" but wait: in our first guess, we had ""crane"" and now we know A wasn't in position 3. But if we try ""C"" (fixed), second letter A? That's possible? 

 However, note: we haven't tested A in position 2. The feedback for ""crane"" says A is present but not in position 3. It could be in position 2. So let's try a word with A in position 2? But wait: that might conflict with R? We know R is present and cannot be in position 2.

 Another possibility: R in position 3 and A in position 4? Or R in position 4 and A in position 5? etc.

 I think a good second guess would be to try A in position 2 and R in a later position? But note: we know R cannot be in position 2, so if we put A in position 2, then R must be in 3,4,5.

 However, let me try to find words that start with C, have A in the second position? Examples: ""CAULK"", ""CATTY"", ""CABAL"", ""CARAT"", but wait:

 We must not use E or N. 

 Also, note: we haven't tested the other letters yet. Maybe we should avoid repeating the same letters? Actually, we need to include R because we know it's there.

 But if I put A in the second position, that would be: C A _ _ _

 Then for the remaining, we need R and two other letters (but no E or N).

 But wait: we don't know if A might be in position 2. So testing that would be useful.

 Alternative: We could try R in position 3 and A in another position. 

 Let me try to think of words:

 Option 1: Try A in position 2: 
   Word: C A _ _ _
   We must include R (in position 3,4, or 5). Also, we want to get information about the other letters.

 Example words: 
   ""CARD"" - but it's 4 letters? We need 5. 
   ""CARDS"" is 5 letters? But we have S? And D? 
   However, we don't know if D and S are in the word? 

 But note: we don't have feedback about D or S? So let's try:

   ""CAR"" + two more letters? 

   Possibilities: 
     ""CARAT"": C A R A T -> but has two A's? We only have one A? Wait, the secret word may have multiple same letters? We don't know yet.

 But in the feedback for ""crane"", we saw A only one time? However, the feedback symbol for A was only for the position we guessed. If there were two A's, we would have more than one A? Actually, the feedback only marks each position individually. So if there is an A elsewhere, it might not have been revealed? 

 However, in ""crane"", we guessed only one A (in position 3) so if there were two A's, the feedback for the other A would not appear because we didn't guess it? So we don't know if there are multiple A's? 

 So, we can use words that have R and A again? But we already know they are present? Maybe we need to check? 

 Actually, for the second guess, we should try to use letters we haven't tried yet? So we can get more information.

 We know the word has C (first) and contains R and A, and not E or N.

 We have tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so we know N and E are absent.

 We haven't tried: many other consonants and vowels (except A and R).

 Since there are 5 positions, we need to fill positions 2,3,4,5.

 We know:
   Position 1: C
   Position 2: cannot be R (from feedback on position2 of first guess), and we don't know what it is? So we want to test possible letters.

 Let me avoid using E and N again? But actually, we know they are absent? So we can avoid them? Or we can test them? But they are already known absent? So no need to re-use? 

 In fact, we should not use E or N because we know they are not in the word? Because if we use them again, they will get ""x"" and not give new information? So avoid E and N.

 So, for the second guess, we should pick a word that:
   - starts with C
   - has R and A in positions that are not forbidden (R not in 2, A not in 3) 
   - uses new letters (to maximize information)

 Let me consider: 
   Position 2: we can put a new letter? Or A? 

 If we put A in position 2? Then we test if it's there? That would be efficient? Because if it is, we get a match? Otherwise, we know it must be in position 4 or 5.

 Similarly, we can put R in a new position? 

 Let me try to build a word:

   Option: Put A in position 4? Then we can test that? And R in position 5? 

   Example: C _ _ A R

   What letters for position 2 and 3? We need to pick letters we haven't tried? 

   Letters we've already tried: C, R, A, N, E. So to get new information, use others.

   Let me pick common consonants: S, T, L, etc.? 

   Word: C L T A R? That's not a word? 

   Word: C H A R M? But note: we cannot put A in position 3? Because the feedback said A is not in position 3? We guessed it in position 3 and it was wrong? So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it's wrong? So why waste? 

   So we should avoid putting A in position 3? Similarly, avoid R in position 2? 

   Therefore, in the second guess, we avoid:
      Position 2: R? (because we know it's not R)
      Position 3: A? (because we know it's not A there)

   So for the second guess, we can try:

        Position 1: C (fixed)
        Position 2: a new letter? (not R, and we are unsure about A? But we can try A? but if we try A in position2 and it turns out to be there, that's good? If not, then we know A must be in 4 or 5? Either way we get information?).

        Why not try A in position2? That will directly tell us if A is in the second position? 

        If we do that:

          Word: C A ? ? ?

          And we must have R? somewhere in 3,4,5? And also, we want to test two more letters? 

          And for the other positions, we avoid E and N? And use new letters? 

          Example: ""CARAT"": 
            C A R A T? The A in the third position? We cannot put A in the third position? Because we know from previous feedback that A is not in position 3? So it would be incorrect? 

          So we can't double A? Or we can? But we don't know? Wait: if the word has two A's? Then we are allowed? But we have feedback: we guessed A in position3 and got a '-' meaning at least one A is present? But that doesn't tell us how many? So it could be multiple? 

          But if we put A in position3 again? And there is only one A? Then we would get an 'x'? But if there are two? Then we get a '-'? 

          However, we are less confident? 

          Alternatively: avoid A in position3? So don't test there? 

        So, let me choose a word that doesn't put A in position3? 

        Example: 
          ""CABAL"" -> C A B A L? This has A in position2 and position4? 
          But then we have two A's? 

        How about: ""CARTY""? Not a word? 

        Better: ""CARBS"" -> C A R B S? But here R is in position3? And we don't know if that's correct? 

        But note: we are allowed to put R in any position? But in the first guess, R was in position2? Now we want to test it elsewhere? 

        Let me see: 
          Word: C A R B S
          Would that be valid? 

        However, we are putting R in position3? That could be the correct position? 

        But wait: we don't know? We only know R is not in position2? 

        So using ""CARBS"" (if it's a word) should work? 

        But let me double-check: 
          CARBS: it's a word (plural of carb, carbohydrate).

        However, note: we have A in position2? If the secret word has A in position2? Then we get ✓? If not, then we know A must be in position4 or5? 

        So let's try ""CARBS"": 
          C A R B S

        Also, we are using B and S? Which are new? So we get information about B and S? 

        But note: avoid E and N? CARBS doesn't have E or N? 

        So ""carbs"" is a valid word? 

        However, what if the secret word doesn't have A in position2? Then our guess might be inefficient? 

        Alternatively, we might avoid A in position2? And put A in position4? For example, ""C_ _ A R""? 

        Example: ""C T L A R""? Not a word? 

        Or ""CHAFR""? Not a word.

        More common: ""COBRA"" -> but that starts with C, O, B, R, A? 
          C O B R A -> then A is in position5? 
          But note: we are putting O and B? 
          Also, R is in position4? 

        But in this word, we haven't put R in position2? And not A in position3? So okay? 

        However, we are not testing A in position2? 

        Maybe: ""CURLY"" -> C U R L Y? Then we have R in position3? But where is A? We skipped A? Wait, we know the word has A? But we need to test A? So we must include A? 

        So we cannot skip A? Because we know it's in the word? 

        Therefore, guess must include A? 

        So let's consider: ""COBRA"": 
          C O B R A -> includes A at the end (position5) and R at position4? 

        That seems okay? 

        But wait: let's compare:

          Option1: ""CARBS"": tests A in position2 and R in position3? And introduces B and S?
          Option2: ""COBRA"": tests O and B? and R in position4 and A in position5? 

        Which is better? 

        Since we have limited guesses? We want as much new information as possible? 

        With ""CARBS"": if the word has A in position2? Then we know? And we test R in position3? 
        With ""COBRA"": we test A in position5? But we don't know if A might be in position2? 

        And we have two new letters (O,B) instead of two (B,S)? 

        Also note: in ""crane"" we tested nothing? Only C,R,A (with R and A incorrect positions) and N, E absent? 

        But I think testing A in position2 is efficient? Because if it is there? Then we know? And we also put R in position3? 

        However, if it's not? Then we know A is in position4 or5? 

        The problem is: we have two letters to place: R and A? So any guess we make should aim to pin down their positions? 

        Also, note: the word must have C _ _ _ _? 

        After ""crane"", possible words? 

        Example: 
          ""C"" in position1, and then? 
          Possible words: 
            ""CATER""? no E -> excluded.
            ""CABIN""? no because has N -> excluded.
            ""CARRY"" -> has two R's? and Y? But no E or N? 
            ""CARRS""? Not common? 

        Or ""CHAIR"" -> has H and I? 

        But we don't know? 

        Given the constraints, let me go with ""CARBS""? 

        But wait: I must ensure that we are not violating the feedback? For ""CARBS"" our guess? 

        Positions:
          Position1: C -> should be ✓? 
          Position2: A -> could be ✓ or could be x? (if A is not there? We get '-' or 'x'? Actually, if A is in the word but in a different position? we get '-'? If not? Then we get x? But we know A is in the word? So we must get either ✓ (if in position2) or '-' (if not in position2 but present) ... wait, no: the feedback for a letter that is in the word but not in the guessed position gets '-'. If it's in the correct position, ✓. 

        So for position2 in ""CARBS"": 
          If the secret word has A in position2: ✓ for A? 
          Else: if A is in the word? then we get '-' for A? because we guessed it in position2? But wait? Actually, the feedback would mark:
            For position2: If A is not in position2? Then if the secret word has an A? then we get '-'? Because the letter A is in the word? So we will not get x? 

        So we will not get an x for A? because we know the word has A? 

        Therefore, guessing ""CARBS"" is safe? 

        But note: if the word has two A's? But we don't know? 

        However, the same applies: if we have A in position2 and it's correct? we get ✓? otherwise, if the word has an A not in that position? we get '-'? 

        So let's go with ""carbs"". 

        Alternatively, what about ""CARTY""? Not a word? Or ""CARTS"", which is a word? 

        ""CARTS"": C A R T S -> same as CARBS, but T instead of B? 

        Since both are common? 

        But I think CARBS is fine? 

        Another common word: ""CAROL""? -> but that has O and L? 

        But note: CAROL: C A R O L? Then R is in position3? and A in position2? 

        Same as CARBS? 

        However, CAROL does not avoid E? No, CAROL doesn't have E or N? 

        But we can choose any? 

        Let me stick with CARBS? 

        Or maybe ""CLARA""? -> C L A R A? Then A is in position3? which we are not supposed to? Because our first feedback said A is not in position3? So putting A in position3? We expect it to be wrong? 

        So avoid?

        Therefore: CARBS seems a good option? 

        Let me check if it's a valid word? Yes: ""carbs"" is the plural of carb? 

        So I'll go with ""carbs"". 

        But wait: what about avoiding letters that might be vowels? The secret word may have vowels? We have already ruled out E? And we have A? So remaining vowels: O, I, U? 

        CARBS has no vowels? Besides A? Well, A is vowel? And the rest are consonants? 

        But if we want to test vowels? Then ""CAROL"" might be better? 

        However, we are limited? 

        But I think CARBS is acceptable? 

 So my second guess: ""carbs""

<guess>carbs</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The first letter **C** is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- **R** is present in the word but not in position 2.
- **A** is present in the word but not in position 3.
- **N** and **E** are not in the word at all.

For the second guess, we need:
- The word to start with **C**.
- To include **R** and **A**, but avoid placing **R** in position 2 and **A** in position 3.
- To avoid using **N** and **E**.
- To test new potential letters for positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 while prioritizing common letters.

A strategic choice is ""carbs"": 
- It starts with **C**.
- It positions **A** in position 2 (testing if **A** belongs there).
- It positions **R** in position 3 (testing its correct placement).
- It introduces new common letters **B** and **S**.
- It follows feedback constraints: **R** not in position 2, **A** not in position 3, and avoids **N** and **E**.

This guess will help clarify the positions of **A** and **R** while providing new information about **B** and **S**.",Guess 2: carbs -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(-) R(-) B(x) S(x),FAIL

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it's marked as wrong position).
 - A is in the word but not in position 3.
 - N is not in the word at all.
 - E is not in the word at all.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word starts with C (position 1).
 - The secret word contains R, but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5).
 - The secret word contains A, but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 4 or 5, since position 1 is C).
 - The secret word does not contain N or E.

 Therefore, the word we are looking for is:
   C _ _ _ _

 And it has R and A somewhere in positions 2,3,4,5 but:
   - R is not in position 2 -> so R in 3,4, or 5.
   - A is not in position 3 -> so A in 4 or 5 (since position 2 is still open and we don't have A in position 2 yet? Actually, we don't know about position 2 for A? The feedback only says A is not in position 3, but it could be in 2? Wait, let me clarify.

 Important: The feedback for A says ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in the position we guessed, which was position 3. So A is not in position 3, but it could be in position 2, 4, or 5? But note: we don't have any information about position 2 yet.

 However, in the feedback for R: it was guessed in position 2 and we got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not there. So position 2 of the secret word is not R.

 Now, for A: we guessed it in position 3 and got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. It could be in position 2,4, or 5.

 But we also know the word does not have E or N.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that includes R and A (since they are in the word) and avoids N and E, and also the first letter must be C.

 So, our next guess should start with C, include R and A (but R not in position 2, A not in position 3), and not include N or E.

 We want to test possible positions for R and A, and also get information about the other letters.

 Let me think of words that fit:
   C _ _ _ _
   and the word must contain R and A.

 Possible positions:
   R can be in position 3,4,5.
   A can be in position 2,4,5 (but note: if A is in position 2, then it's the second letter).

 We also want to try to cover other common letters.

 Since we have two known letters (R and A) to place, and we don't know the other two letters.

 Let me consider words that start with C, have R and A, avoid N and E.

 Example: 
   ""CAR..."" but wait: in our first guess, we had ""crane"" and now we know A wasn't in position 3. But if we try ""C"" (fixed), second letter A? That's possible? 

 However, note: we haven't tested A in position 2. The feedback for ""crane"" says A is present but not in position 3. It could be in position 2. So let's try a word with A in position 2? But wait: that might conflict with R? We know R is present and cannot be in position 2.

 Another possibility: R in position 3 and A in position 4? Or R in position 4 and A in position 5? etc.

 I think a good second guess would be to try A in position 2 and R in a later position? But note: we know R cannot be in position 2, so if we put A in position 2, then R must be in 3,4,5.

 However, let me try to find words that start with C, have A in the second position? Examples: ""CAULK"", ""CATTY"", ""CABAL"", ""CARAT"", but wait:

 We must not use E or N. 

 Also, note: we haven't tested the other letters yet. Maybe we should avoid repeating the same letters? Actually, we need to include R because we know it's there.

 But if I put A in the second position, that would be: C A _ _ _

 Then for the remaining, we need R and two other letters (but no E or N).

 But wait: we don't know if A might be in position 2. So testing that would be useful.

 Alternative: We could try R in position 3 and A in another position. 

 Let me try to think of words:

 Option 1: Try A in position 2: 
   Word: C A _ _ _
   We must include R (in position 3,4, or 5). Also, we want to get information about the other letters.

 Example words: 
   ""CARD"" - but it's 4 letters? We need 5. 
   ""CARDS"" is 5 letters? But we have S? And D? 
   However, we don't know if D and S are in the word? 

 But note: we don't have feedback about D or S? So let's try:

   ""CAR"" + two more letters? 

   Possibilities: 
     ""CARAT"": C A R A T -> but has two A's? We only have one A? Wait, the secret word may have multiple same letters? We don't know yet.

 But in the feedback for ""crane"", we saw A only one time? However, the feedback symbol for A was only for the position we guessed. If there were two A's, we would have more than one A? Actually, the feedback only marks each position individually. So if there is an A elsewhere, it might not have been revealed? 

 However, in ""crane"", we guessed only one A (in position 3) so if there were two A's, the feedback for the other A would not appear because we didn't guess it? So we don't know if there are multiple A's? 

 So, we can use words that have R and A again? But we already know they are present? Maybe we need to check? 

 Actually, for the second guess, we should try to use letters we haven't tried yet? So we can get more information.

 We know the word has C (first) and contains R and A, and not E or N.

 We have tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so we know N and E are absent.

 We haven't tried: many other consonants and vowels (except A and R).

 Since there are 5 positions, we need to fill positions 2,3,4,5.

 We know:
   Position 1: C
   Position 2: cannot be R (from feedback on position2 of first guess), and we don't know what it is? So we want to test possible letters.

 Let me avoid using E and N again? But actually, we know they are absent? So we can avoid them? Or we can test them? But they are already known absent? So no need to re-use? 

 In fact, we should not use E or N because we know they are not in the word? Because if we use them again, they will get ""x"" and not give new information? So avoid E and N.

 So, for the second guess, we should pick a word that:
   - starts with C
   - has R and A in positions that are not forbidden (R not in 2, A not in 3) 
   - uses new letters (to maximize information)

 Let me consider: 
   Position 2: we can put a new letter? Or A? 

 If we put A in position 2? Then we test if it's there? That would be efficient? Because if it is, we get a match? Otherwise, we know it must be in position 4 or 5.

 Similarly, we can put R in a new position? 

 Let me try to build a word:

   Option: Put A in position 4? Then we can test that? And R in position 5? 

   Example: C _ _ A R

   What letters for position 2 and 3? We need to pick letters we haven't tried? 

   Letters we've already tried: C, R, A, N, E. So to get new information, use others.

   Let me pick common consonants: S, T, L, etc.? 

   Word: C L T A R? That's not a word? 

   Word: C H A R M? But note: we cannot put A in position 3? Because the feedback said A is not in position 3? We guessed it in position 3 and it was wrong? So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it's wrong? So why waste? 

   So we should avoid putting A in position 3? Similarly, avoid R in position 2? 

   Therefore, in the second guess, we avoid:
      Position 2: R? (because we know it's not R)
      Position 3: A? (because we know it's not A there)

   So for the second guess, we can try:

        Position 1: C (fixed)
        Position 2: a new letter? (not R, and we are unsure about A? But we can try A? but if we try A in position2 and it turns out to be there, that's good? If not, then we know A must be in 4 or 5? Either way we get information?).

        Why not try A in position2? That will directly tell us if A is in the second position? 

        If we do that:

          Word: C A ? ? ?

          And we must have R? somewhere in 3,4,5? And also, we want to test two more letters? 

          And for the other positions, we avoid E and N? And use new letters? 

          Example: ""CARAT"": 
            C A R A T? The A in the third position? We cannot put A in the third position? Because we know from previous feedback that A is not in position 3? So it would be incorrect? 

          So we can't double A? Or we can? But we don't know? Wait: if the word has two A's? Then we are allowed? But we have feedback: we guessed A in position3 and got a '-' meaning at least one A is present? But that doesn't tell us how many? So it could be multiple? 

          But if we put A in position3 again? And there is only one A? Then we would get an 'x'? But if there are two? Then we get a '-'? 

          However, we are less confident? 

          Alternatively: avoid A in position3? So don't test there? 

        So, let me choose a word that doesn't put A in position3? 

        Example: 
          ""CABAL"" -> C A B A L? This has A in position2 and position4? 
          But then we have two A's? 

        How about: ""CARTY""? Not a word? 

        Better: ""CARBS"" -> C A R B S? But here R is in position3? And we don't know if that's correct? 

        But note: we are allowed to put R in any position? But in the first guess, R was in position2? Now we want to test it elsewhere? 

        Let me see: 
          Word: C A R B S
          Would that be valid? 

        However, we are putting R in position3? That could be the correct position? 

        But wait: we don't know? We only know R is not in position2? 

        So using ""CARBS"" (if it's a word) should work? 

        But let me double-check: 
          CARBS: it's a word (plural of carb, carbohydrate).

        However, note: we have A in position2? If the secret word has A in position2? Then we get ✓? If not, then we know A must be in position4 or5? 

        So let's try ""CARBS"": 
          C A R B S

        Also, we are using B and S? Which are new? So we get information about B and S? 

        But note: avoid E and N? CARBS doesn't have E or N? 

        So ""carbs"" is a valid word? 

        However, what if the secret word doesn't have A in position2? Then our guess might be inefficient? 

        Alternatively, we might avoid A in position2? And put A in position4? For example, ""C_ _ A R""? 

        Example: ""C T L A R""? Not a word? 

        Or ""CHAFR""? Not a word.

        More common: ""COBRA"" -> but that starts with C, O, B, R, A? 
          C O B R A -> then A is in position5? 
          But note: we are putting O and B? 
          Also, R is in position4? 

        But in this word, we haven't put R in position2? And not A in position3? So okay? 

        However, we are not testing A in position2? 

        Maybe: ""CURLY"" -> C U R L Y? Then we have R in position3? But where is A? We skipped A? Wait, we know the word has A? But we need to test A? So we must include A? 

        So we cannot skip A? Because we know it's in the word? 

        Therefore, guess must include A? 

        So let's consider: ""COBRA"": 
          C O B R A -> includes A at the end (position5) and R at position4? 

        That seems okay? 

        But wait: let's compare:

          Option1: ""CARBS"": tests A in position2 and R in position3? And introduces B and S?
          Option2: ""COBRA"": tests O and B? and R in position4 and A in position5? 

        Which is better? 

        Since we have limited guesses? We want as much new information as possible? 

        With ""CARBS"": if the word has A in position2? Then we know? And we test R in position3? 
        With ""COBRA"": we test A in position5? But we don't know if A might be in position2? 

        And we have two new letters (O,B) instead of two (B,S)? 

        Also note: in ""crane"" we tested nothing? Only C,R,A (with R and A incorrect positions) and N, E absent? 

        But I think testing A in position2 is efficient? Because if it is there? Then we know? And we also put R in position3? 

        However, if it's not? Then we know A is in position4 or5? 

        The problem is: we have two letters to place: R and A? So any guess we make should aim to pin down their positions? 

        Also, note: the word must have C _ _ _ _? 

        After ""crane"", possible words? 

        Example: 
          ""C"" in position1, and then? 
          Possible words: 
            ""CATER""? no E -> excluded.
            ""CABIN""? no because has N -> excluded.
            ""CARRY"" -> has two R's? and Y? But no E or N? 
            ""CARRS""? Not common? 

        Or ""CHAIR"" -> has H and I? 

        But we don't know? 

        Given the constraints, let me go with ""CARBS""? 

        But wait: I must ensure that we are not violating the feedback? For ""CARBS"" our guess? 

        Positions:
          Position1: C -> should be ✓? 
          Position2: A -> could be ✓ or could be x? (if A is not there? We get '-' or 'x'? Actually, if A is in the word but in a different position? we get '-'? If not? Then we get x? But we know A is in the word? So we must get either ✓ (if in position2) or '-' (if not in position2 but present) ... wait, no: the feedback for a letter that is in the word but not in the guessed position gets '-'. If it's in the correct position, ✓. 

        So for position2 in ""CARBS"": 
          If the secret word has A in position2: ✓ for A? 
          Else: if A is in the word? then we get '-' for A? because we guessed it in position2? But wait? Actually, the feedback would mark:
            For position2: If A is not in position2? Then if the secret word has an A? then we get '-'? Because the letter A is in the word? So we will not get x? 

        So we will not get an x for A? because we know the word has A? 

        Therefore, guessing ""CARBS"" is safe? 

        But note: if the word has two A's? But we don't know? 

        However, the same applies: if we have A in position2 and it's correct? we get ✓? otherwise, if the word has an A not in that position? we get '-'? 

        So let's go with ""carbs"". 

        Alternatively, what about ""CARTY""? Not a word? Or ""CARTS"", which is a word? 

        ""CARTS"": C A R T S -> same as CARBS, but T instead of B? 

        Since both are common? 

        But I think CARBS is fine? 

        Another common word: ""CAROL""? -> but that has O and L? 

        But note: CAROL: C A R O L? Then R is in position3? and A in position2? 

        Same as CARBS? 

        However, CAROL does not avoid E? No, CAROL doesn't have E or N? 

        But we can choose any? 

        Let me stick with CARBS? 

        Or maybe ""CLARA""? -> C L A R A? Then A is in position3? which we are not supposed to? Because our first feedback said A is not in position3? So putting A in position3? We expect it to be wrong? 

        So avoid?

        Therefore: CARBS seems a good option? 

        Let me check if it's a valid word? Yes: ""carbs"" is the plural of carb? 

        So I'll go with ""carbs"". 

        But wait: what about avoiding letters that might be vowels? The secret word may have vowels? We have already ruled out E? And we have A? So remaining vowels: O, I, U? 

        CARBS has no vowels? Besides A? Well, A is vowel? And the rest are consonants? 

        But if we want to test vowels? Then ""CAROL"" might be better? 

        However, we are limited? 

        But I think CARBS is acceptable? 

 So my second guess: ""carbs""

<guess>carbs</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The first letter **C** is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- **R** is present in the word but not in position 2.
- **A** is present in the word but not in position 3.
- **N** and **E** are not in the word at all.

For the second guess, we need:
- The word to start with **C**.
- To include **R** and **A**, but avoid placing **R** in position 2 and **A** in position 3.
- To avoid using **N** and **E**.
- To test new potential letters for positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 while prioritizing common letters.

A strategic choice is ""carbs"": 
- It starts with **C**.
- It positions **A** in position 2 (testing if **A** belongs there).
- It positions **R** in position 3 (testing its correct placement).
- It introduces new common letters **B** and **S**.
- It follows feedback constraints: **R** not in position 2, **A** not in position 3, and avoids **N** and **E**.

This guess will help clarify the positions of **A** and **R** while providing new information about **B** and **S**.

Actually, we don\'t know about position 2 for A? The feedback only says A is not in position 3, but it could be in 2? Wait, let me clarify.\n\n Important: The feedback for A says ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but not in the position we guessed, which was position 3. So A is not in position 3, but it could be in position 2, 4, or 5? But note: we don\'t have any information about position 2 yet.\n\n However, in the feedback for R: it was guessed in position 2 and we got ""-"", meaning it\'s in the word but not there. So position 2 of the secret word is not R.\n\n Now, for A: we guessed it in position 3 and got ""-"", meaning it\'s in the word but not in position 3. It could be in position 2,4, or 5.\n\n But we also know the word does not have E or N.\n\n Now, we need to make a second guess that includes R and A (since they are in the word) and avoids N and E, and also the first letter must be C.\n\n So, our next guess should start with C, include R and A (but R not in position 2, A not in position 3), and not include N or E.\n\n We want to test possible positions for R and A, and also get information about the other letters.\n\n Let me think of words that fit:\n   C _ _ _ _\n   and the word must contain R and A.\n\n Possible positions:\n   R can be in position 3,4,5.\n   A can be in position 2,4,5 (but note: if A is in position 2, then it\'s the second letter).\n\n We also want to try to cover other common letters.\n\n Since we have two known letters (R and A) to place, and we don\'t know the other two letters.\n\n Let me consider words that start with C, have R and A, avoid N and E.\n\n Example: \n   ""CAR..."" but wait: in our first guess, we had ""crane"" and now we know A wasn\'t in position 3. But if we try ""C"" (fixed), second letter A? That\'s possible? \n\n However, note: we haven\'t tested A in position 2. The feedback for ""crane"" says A is present but not in position 3. It could be in position 2. So let\'s try a word with A in position 2? But wait: that might conflict with R? We know R is present and cannot be in position 2.\n\n Another possibility: R in position 3 and A in position 4? Or R in position 4 and A in position 5? etc.\n\n I think a good second guess would be to try A in position 2 and R in a later position? But note: we know R cannot be in position 2, so if we put A in position 2, then R must be in 3,4,5.\n\n However, let me try to find words that start with C, have A in the second position? Examples: ""CAULK"", ""CATTY"", ""CABAL"", ""CARAT"", but wait:\n\n We must not use E or N. \n\n Also, note: we haven\'t tested the other letters yet. Maybe we should avoid repeating the same letters? Actually, we need to include R because we know it\'s there.\n\n But if I put A in the second position, that would be: C A _ _ _\n\n Then for the remaining, we need R and two other letters (but no E or N).\n\n But wait: we don\'t know if A might be in position 2. So testing that would be useful.\n\n Alternative: We could try R in position 3 and A in another position. \n\n Let me try to think of words:\n\n Option 1: Try A in position 2: \n   Word: C A _ _ _\n   We must include R (in position 3,4, or 5). Also, we want to get information about the other letters.\n\n Example words: \n   ""CARD"" - but it\'s 4 letters? We need 5. \n   ""CARDS"" is 5 letters? But we have S? And D? \n   However, we don\'t know if D and S are in the word? \n\n But note: we don\'t have feedback about D or S? So let\'s try:\n\n   ""CAR"" + two more letters? \n\n   Possibilities: \n     ""CARAT"": C A R A T -> but has two A\'s? We only have one A? Wait, the secret word may have multiple same letters? We don\'t know yet.\n\n But in the feedback for ""crane"", we saw A only one time? However, the feedback symbol for A was only for the position we guessed. If there were two A\'s, we would have more than one A? Actually, the feedback only marks each position individually. So if there is an A elsewhere, it might not have been revealed? \n\n However, in ""crane"", we guessed only one A (in position 3) so if there were two A\'s, the feedback for the other A would not appear because we didn\'t guess it? So we don\'t know if there are multiple A\'s? \n\n So, we can use words that have R and A again? But we already know they are present? Maybe we need to check? \n\n Actually, for the second guess, we should try to use letters we haven\'t tried yet? So we can get more information.\n\n We know the word has C (first) and contains R and A, and not E or N.\n\n We have tried: C, R, A, N, E -> so we know N and E are absent.\n\n We haven\'t tried: many other consonants and vowels (except A and R).\n\n Since there are 5 positions, we need to fill positions 2,3,4,5.\n\n We know:\n   Position 1: C\n   Position 2: cannot be R (from feedback on position2 of first guess), and we don\'t know what it is? So we want to test possible letters.\n\n Let me avoid using E and N again? But actually, we know they are absent? So we can avoid them? Or we can test them? But they are already known absent? So no need to re-use? \n\n In fact, we should not use E or N because we know they are not in the word? Because if we use them again, they will get ""x"" and not give new information? So avoid E and N.\n\n So, for the second guess, we should pick a word that:\n   - starts with C\n   - has R and A in positions that are not forbidden (R not in 2, A not in 3) \n   - uses new letters (to maximize information)\n\n Let me consider: \n   Position 2: we can put a new letter? Or A? \n\n If we put A in position 2? Then we test if it\'s there? That would be efficient? Because if it is, we get a match? Otherwise, we know it must be in position 4 or 5.\n\n Similarly, we can put R in a new position? \n\n Let me try to build a word:\n\n   Option: Put A in position 4? Then we can test that? And R in position 5? \n\n   Example: C _ _ A R\n\n   What letters for position 2 and 3? We need to pick letters we haven\'t tried? \n\n   Letters we\'ve already tried: C, R, A, N, E. So to get new information, use others.\n\n   Let me pick common consonants: S, T, L, etc.? \n\n   Word: C L T A R? That\'s not a word? \n\n   Word: C H A R M? But note: we cannot put A in position 3? Because the feedback said A is not in position 3? We guessed it in position 3 and it was wrong? So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it\'s wrong? So why waste? \n\n   So we should avoid putting A in position 3? Similarly, avoid R in position 2? \n\n   Therefore, in the second guess, we avoid:\n      Position 2: R? (because we know it\'s not R)\n      Position 3: A? (because we know it\'s not A there)\n\n   So for the second guess, we can try:\n\n        Position 1: C (fixed)\n        Position 2: a new letter? (not R, and we are unsure about A? But we can try A? but if we try A in position2 and it turns out to be there, that\'s good? If not, then we know A must be in 4 or 5? Either way we get information?).\n\n        Why not try A in position2? That will directly tell us if A is in the second position? \n\n        If we do that:\n\n          Word: C A ? ? ?\n\n          And we must have R? somewhere in 3,4,5? And also, we want to test two more letters? \n\n          And for the other positions, we avoid E and N? And use new letters? \n\n          Example: ""CARAT"": \n            C A R A T? The A in the third position? We cannot put A in the third position? Because we know from previous feedback that A is not in position 3? So it would be incorrect? \n\n          So we can\'t double A? Or we can? But we don\'t know? Wait: if the word has two A\'s? Then we are allowed? But we have feedback: we guessed A in position3 and got a \'-\' meaning at least one A is present? But that doesn\'t tell us how many? So it could be multiple? \n\n          But if we put A in position3 again? And there is only one A? Then we would get an \'x\'? But if there are two? Then we get a \'-\'? \n\n          However, we are less confident? \n\n          Alternatively: avoid A in position3? So don\'t test there? \n\n        So, let me choose a word that doesn\'t put A in position3? \n\n        Example: \n          ""CABAL"" -> C A B A L? This has A in position2 and position4? \n          But then we have two A\'s? \n\n        How about: ""CARTY""? Not a word? \n\n        Better: ""CARBS"" -> C A R B S? But here R is in position3? And we don\'t know if that\'s correct? \n\n        But note: we are allowed to put R in any position? But in the first guess, R was in position2? Now we want to test it elsewhere? \n\n        Let me see: \n          Word: C A R B S\n          Would that be valid? \n\n        However, we are putting R in position3? That could be the correct position? \n\n        But wait: we don\'t know? We only know R is not in position2? \n\n        So using ""CARBS"" (if it\'s a word) should work? \n\n        But let me double-check: \n          CARBS: it\'s a word (plural of carb, carbohydrate).\n\n        However, note: we have A in position2? If the secret word has A in position2? Then we get ✓? If not, then we know A must be in position4 or5? \n\n        So let\'s try ""CARBS"": \n          C A R B S\n\n        Also, we are using B and S? Which are new? So we get information about B and S? \n\n        But note: avoid E and N? CARBS doesn\'t have E or N? \n\n        So ""carbs"" is a valid word? \n\n        However, what if the secret word doesn\'t have A in position2? Then our guess might be inefficient? \n\n        Alternatively, we might avoid A in position2? And put A in position4? For example, ""C_ _ A R""? \n\n        Example: ""C T L A R""? Not a word? \n\n        Or ""CHAFR""? Not a word.\n\n        More common: ""COBRA"" -> but that starts with C, O, B, R, A? \n          C O B R A -> then A is in position5? \n          But note: we are putting O and B? \n          Also, R is in position4? \n\n        But in this word, we haven\'t put R in position2? And not A in position3? So okay? \n\n        However, we are not testing A in position2? \n\n        Maybe: ""CURLY"" -> C U R L Y? Then we have R in position3? But where is A? We skipped A? Wait, we know the word has A? But we need to test A? So we must include A? \n\n        So we cannot skip A? Because we know it\'s in the word? \n\n        Therefore, guess must include A? \n\n        So let\'s consider: ""COBRA"": \n          C O B R A -> includes A at the end (position5) and R at position4? \n\n        That seems okay? \n\n        But wait: let\'s compare:\n\n          Option1: ""CARBS"": tests A in position2 and R in position3? And introduces B and S?\n          Option2: ""COBRA"": tests O and B? and R in position4 and A in position5? \n\n        Which is better? \n\n        Since we have limited guesses? We want as much new information as possible? \n\n        With ""CARBS"": if the word has A in position2? Then we know? And we test R in position3? \n        With ""COBRA"": we test A in position5? But we don\'t know if A might be in position2? \n\n        And we have two new letters (O,B) instead of two (B,S)? \n\n        Also note: in ""crane"" we tested nothing? Only C,R,A (with R and A incorrect positions) and N, E absent? \n\n        But I think testing A in position2 is efficient? Because if it is there? Then we know? And we also put R in position3? \n\n        However, if it\'s not? Then we know A is in position4 or5? \n\n        The problem is: we have two letters to place: R and A? So any guess we make should aim to pin down their positions? \n\n        Also, note: the word must have C _ _ _ _? \n\n        After ""crane"", possible words? \n\n        Example: \n          ""C"" in position1, and then? \n          Possible words: \n            ""CATER""? no E -> excluded.\n            ""CABIN""? no because has N -> excluded.\n            ""CARRY"" -> has two R\'s? and Y? But no E or N? \n            ""CARRS""? Not common? \n\n        Or ""CHAIR"" -> has H and I? \n\n        But we don\'t know? \n\n        Given the constraints, let me go with ""CARBS""? \n\n        But wait: I must ensure that we are not violating the feedback? For ""CARBS"" our guess? \n\n        Positions:\n          Position1: C -> should be ✓? \n          Position2: A -> could be ✓ or could be x? (if A is not there? We get \'-\' or \'x\'? Actually, if A is in the word but in a different position? we get \'-\'? If not? Then we get x? But we know A is in the word? So we must get either ✓ (if in position2) or \'-\' (if not in position2 but present) ... wait, no: the feedback for a letter that is in the word but not in the guessed position gets \'-\'. If it\'s in the correct position, ✓. \n\n        So for position2 in ""CARBS"": \n          If the secret word has A in position2: ✓ for A? \n          Else: if A is in the word? then we get \'-\' for A? because we guessed it in position2? But wait? Actually, the feedback would mark:\n            For position2: If A is not in position2? Then if the secret word has an A? then we get \'-\'? Because the letter A is in the word? So we will not get x? \n\n        So we will not get an x for A? because we know the word has A? \n\n        Therefore, guessing ""CARBS"" is safe? \n\n        But note: if the word has two A\'s? But we don\'t know? \n\n        However, the same applies: if we have A in position2 and it\'s correct? we get ✓? otherwise, if the word has an A not in that position? we get \'-\'? \n\n        So let\'s go with ""carbs"". \n\n        Alternatively, what about ""CARTY""? Not a word? Or ""CARTS"", which is a word? \n\n        ""CARTS"": C A R T S -> same as CARBS, but T instead of B? \n\n        Since both are common? \n\n        But I think CARBS is fine? \n\n        Another common word: ""CAROL""? -> but that has O and L? \n\n        But note: CAROL: C A R O L? Then R is in position3? and A in position2? \n\n        Same as CARBS? \n\n        However, CAROL does not avoid E? No, CAROL doesn\'t have E or N? \n\n        But we can choose any? \n\n        Let me stick with CARBS? \n\n        Or maybe ""CLARA""? -> C L A R A? Then A is in position3? which we are not supposed to? Because our first feedback said A is not in position3? So putting A in position3? We expect it to be wrong? \n\n        So avoid?\n\n        Therefore: CARBS seems a good option? \n\n        Let me check if it\'s a valid word? Yes: ""carbs"" is the plural of carb? \n\n        So I\'ll go with ""carbs"". \n\n        But wait: what about avoiding letters that might be vowels? The secret word may have vowels? We have already ruled out E? And we have A? So remaining vowels: O, I, U? \n\n        CARBS has no vowels? Besides A? Well, A is vowel? And the rest are consonants? \n\n        But if we want to test vowels? Then ""CAROL"" might be better? \n\n        However, we are limited? \n\n        But I think CARBS is acceptable? \n\n So my second guess: ""carbs""\n\n<guess>carbs</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- The first letter **C** is correct and in the right position (position 1).\n- **R** is present in the word but not in position 2.\n- **A** is present in the word but not in position 3.\n- **N** and **E** are not in the word at all.\n\nFor the second guess, we need:\n- The word to start with **C**.\n- To include **R** and **A**, but avoid placing **R** in position 2 and **A** in position 3.\n- To avoid using **N** and **E**.\n- To test new potential letters for positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 while prioritizing common letters.\n\nA strategic choice is ""carbs"": \n- It starts with **C**.\n- It positions **A** in position 2 (testing if **A** belongs there).\n- It positions **R** in position 3 (testing its correct placement).\n- It introduces new common letters **B** and **S**.\n- It follows feedback constraints: **R** not in position 2, **A** not in position 3, and avoids **N** and **E**.\n\nThis guess will help clarify the positions of **A** and **R** while providing new information about **B** and **S**.\n\n<guess>carbs</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: carbs -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(-) R(-) B(x) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is in the correct position (position 1).
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N and E are not in the word.

Guess 2: carbs -> C(✓) A(-) R(-) B(x) S(x)
Interpretation:
- C is again correct in position 1 (as expected).
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (since we got '-' for position 2).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed it in position 3 and got '-').
- B and S are not in the word.

Synthesizing information:
1. The secret word starts with C (position 1).
2. The word contains R, but not in positions 2 or 3 (since both guesses placed R in positions 2 and 3 and got '-' each time). So R must be in position 4 or 5.
3. The word contains A, but not in positions 2 or 3 (from guess2 A in position2: '-', guess1 A in position3: '-'). So A must be in position 4 or 5.
4. The word does NOT contain: N, E, B, S.

Since positions 4 and 5 must contain both R and A, but they are two positions, we have two possibilities:
- Either R is in position 4 and A in position 5, or
- R is in position 5 and A in position 4.

However, note that the word may also have repeated letters? But we don't have evidence of that yet? We only have one instance of each so far? So we'll assume for now that R and A appear once? But we need to consider both orders? 

Additionally, positions 2 and 3 are still unknown? But we know they cannot contain N, E, B, S? And they must be letters that haven't been eliminated? 

So the word structure is: 
   C _ _ _ ? ?
   Where the last two positions are some order of R and A? 
   And positions 2 and 3 must be filled with letters that are not among the eliminated ones (N, E, B, S) and also not repeating? 

We also need to consider that we haven't tested many vowels? We know A is in the word? Remaining vowels? We have tried E? Eliminated? So remaining vowels: O, I, U? But also Y? 

Now, we must make a third guess. We want to test:
  - The order of R and A in the last two positions? 
  - The letters in positions 2 and 3? 

We can try to fill positions 4 and 5 with either R then A? or A then R? And pick letters for positions 2 and 3 that are common? And have not been eliminated? 

Possible words:

Option 1: Assume position 4 is R and position 5 is A? Then the word: C _ _ R A? 
  We need two letters for positions 2 and 3? And these letters must not be N,E,B,S? Also, the whole word must be valid? 

Option 2: Assume position 4 is A and position 5 is R? Then: C _ _ A R? 

We don't know which? So we can make a guess that tests one of these two orderings? 

Let's list possible words? 

First, letters eliminated: N, E, B, S? Cannot be in the word? 
Also, we have tried: C, R, A? We know they are in? We want to test new letters? 

For position 2 and 3? Let us pick common consonants that haven't been tried? and vowels not eliminated? 

Common letters: T, L, P, D, M, H, Y, etc? 

Possible words for option 1 (C _ _ R A): 
   Examples: 
      ""CITRA"" -> C I T R A? 
      ""CUPRA""? 
      ""CYRRA""? Not common? 

   Valid words: 
      ""CLARA"": but note? We tried A again? And we know A is in position5? So structure: C L A R A? But that would be two A's? Because we are putting A in position3 and position5? But: 
        - We have no feedback that says A cannot be in multiple positions? 
        - But in our first guess, we guessed A in position3? And got '-' meaning A is in the word but not position3? If the word had an A in position5? Then we would have gotten '-' for the A we guessed? Not for position3? 
        - However, if the word has two A's? Then in guess1: we guessed A in position3? and there is an A in position5? that would cause the '-'? Because one A is present? 
        - Similarly, in guess2: we guessed A in position2? If there are two A's? Then we get '-'? 
        - So we cannot rule out two A's? 

      But let me check? In ""CLARA"": 
        C L A R A? 
        But wait: position3 is A? And our feedback from the first guess said A is not in position3? So if we guess ""CLARA"", we must get '-' for A in position3? Because it shouldn't be there? Or we will get feedback based on the actual? 
        If the secret word is ""CLARA"", then the A in position3 is correct? But our first guess? We guessed ""CRANE"" with A in position3? and the word has A in position3? Then we should have gotten ✓? But we didn't? We got '-'? Meaning the A we guessed? Is in the word? But not in position3? So if ""CLARA"" were the secret word? Then in guess1 (""CRANE""? positions C R A N E) vs ""CLARA""? 
          Position1: C ✓ 
          Position2: R vs L? L is not R? but the secret word has R? But we guessed R in position2? Which is wrong? But R is in position4? So we get '-' for R because it's in the word? 
          Position3: A vs A? But if the secret word is ""CLARA"": position3 is A? So we would have gotten ✓ for A in position3? But we didn't; we got '-'? So ""CLARA"" cannot be the secret word? Because we got '-' for A in position3? meaning that at the time? there was no A in position3? 

      Therefore, the secret word does not have A in position3? So any word we guess? We should not put A in position3? 

      Similarly, we know A cannot be in position3? So ""CLARA"" is invalid? Because it would force A in position3? 

      So we avoid putting A in position3? And similarly? R not in position2 or 3? 

Therefore, in our guess for positions 2 and 3? We must use letters that are not A? and not R? And also avoid N,E,B,S? 

So let's try ""C _ _ R A"": 
   Positions 2 and 3? Must be letters not eliminated? And not A, R? 

   Possible common words: 
     ""CITRA"": C I T R A? 
        I and T? are new? 
     ""CUPRA""? Not common? 
     ""CIGAR""? But G? and then R? No, that would be C I G A R? which is 5 letters? But the last A is missing? Wait? 

     ""CIGAR"" is C I G A R? Then positions:
        Position1: C
        Position2: I
        Position3: G
        Position4: A? 
        Position5: R? 
        That's option2: A in position4 and R in position5? 

   Actually, let us form two possible templates 

   Template1 (R in position4, then A in position5): C _ _ R A
      We need two letters? Examples: 
        ""COBRA"": O and B? But B is eliminated? 
        Not viable? 

      ""CYMRA"": Not common? 
      ""CAPRA"": C A P R A? But then we have A in position2? We already know from guess2 that A is not in position2? So that would violate? And also, the word ""CAPRA""? 
      ""DICRA"" - not a word? 

      Hard to find? 

   Template2 (A in position4, R in position5): C _ _ A R? 
      Examples: 
        ""CIGAR"": C I G A R? 
        ""COLAR"": C O L A R? 
        ""COPAR"": Not common? 

      ""CIGAR"": valid? 
      ""COLAR"": valid? 

   Alternatively? Maybe R in position4 and A in position5? Then a word: but let's see? ""CERA"": No, E eliminated? 

   Since template2 seems to have more words? Let me consider ""CIGAR"" or ""COLAR""? 

   But we don't know? Also, we want to test common? 

   However, note: we also need to cover positions 2 and 3? With new letters? To get more information? 

   So let's pick one? 

   Potential words: 
      ""CIGAR"": letters: C, I, G, A, R? 
          We haven't tried I, G? 
      ""COLAR"": C, O, L, A, R? 
          O and L are new? 

   But note: we don't know what the secret word is? So either could be? 

   However, another idea? We can also test a word that doesn't necessarily commit to an ordering? But tests both? 

   Alternatively? Since we have two possibilities for the last two positions? Maybe we can test with a word that has either R or A in the two pending positions? but not both? That would be inefficient? Because we know both are present? 

   So let's choose ""CIGAR"": 
        C I G A R? 

        We are putting A in position4? and R in position5? 
        Positions2 and3: I and G? 

        This doesn't test if R could be in position4? But we will get feedback? 

        Let's predict feedback? 
          If the secret word has A in position4 and R in position5? then:
             position4: A ✓, position5: R ✓? 
          But if the secret word has R in position4 and A in position5? then we would get for A (in position4): '-', meaning it's present? but elsewhere? and for R (in position5): '-'? meaning it's present? How about position5? We guessed R? But if the secret word has A in position5? then we'll get: 
             position4: A compared to R? since R is in position4? so we would get an 'x' for the A? because A is in the word? But not R? Wait? 

        Actually: 
          If the secret word is C X X R A? (with R in4 and A in5)? 
          Then our guess: C I G A R? 
          Position1: C ✓
          Position2: I? compared to X? (unknown)? 
          Position3: G? compared to unknown?
          Position4: A? compared to R? Since R is in the word? but not in position4? Then we get '-' for A? because A is elsewhere? But wait? A is in the word? in position5? So A in our guess? gets '-'? meaning present? 
          Position5: R? compared to A? But R is present? in position4? So R also gets '-'? 

        Therefore, we cannot tell the difference? 

        Actually, we will get for the positions 4 and5: 
           A: '-' (because present? and we guessed in wrong position? i.e., we guessed position4? but A is in5?) 
           R: '-' (because present? but in the wrong position? we guessed5? but in4?) 

        Then also? if the secret word has I or G? but we don't know? 

        But we can interpret the feedback? 

        However, we want to avoid getting '-' for both R and A? So we can know? 

        Alternatively? We might test a word that has R in position5? and A in position4? Then if the secret word has R in4 and A in5? we get the same? 

        Therefore, we must accept that? And then focus on testing positions2 and3? 

        But we have limited guesses? 

   Another option? We don't need to commit? We can choose a word that has one more vowel and common letters? 

   Let me try to think: since we have two positions? How about ""CYNAR""? Not common? 

   Actually, let me list English words matching the pattern: C???R? But we are not sure? 

   Possible words ending with R or A? 

   Given the constraints? The only possibilities I can think of are:

   Option A: ...A then R? like CIGAR, COLAR, COVER? but E eliminated? 

   Option B: ...R then A? examples: 
      ""CAPRA"": but CAPRA? with A in position2 and non-? But guess2? A not in position2? So CAPRA? cannot? because position2? A? so guess2? already told us A is not in position2? 
      ""FAUNA"": starts with F? 
      ""CHINA"": N eliminated? 
      ""CARIA""? But we don't know? 

   Actually, it's hard? 

   Another possibility? Maybe the secret word has two R's? For example? But we haven't guessed two R's? 

   Given that, I think the most likely ordering is A in position4 and R in position5? because that yields common words? 

   So words: C? ? A R? 
     With positions2 and3? Must be letters not eliminated? and not A? R? 

   So let us try: 
     C? ? A R? 
     With ? and? not in {N,E,B,S}? 

   Common: 
     ""CIGAR"" -> I and G? 
     ""COLAR"" -> O and L? 
     ""COHAR"" -> rare? 
     ""CIVAR"" -> rare? 

   Also, ""CEDAR"": E eliminated? 
        ""CEDAR"" has E? 

   So let's guess ""CIGAR""? That tests I and G? 
        Positions2: I? 
        Position3: G? 

        And if the secret word ends with AR? Then we test that? 

        Alternatively? We could guess ""COLAR""? 

        To maximize new letter coverage? We choose one that uses more common letters? 

        ""CIGAR"" uses I and G? 
        ""COLAR"" uses O and L? 

        Both seem common? 

   Since no preference? I'll pick ""COLAR""? because L is a very common letter? 

   Or maybe ""CIGAR""? 

   Let me choose ""CIGAR""? 

   But note: to avoid missing? 

   Actually? We have a chance to get it correct? If the secret word is ""CIGAR""? 

   But if not? We get feedback? 

   So guess: ""CIGAR""

But wait? In guess2 we already eliminated B and S? So if we guess ""CIGAR"", it's valid? 

So:

   Guess: C I G A R

Let me write the feedback we would expect? 
   Position1: C ✓? automatic? 
   Position4: If the secret word has A in position4? ✓? also R? 
   But note? We are guessing A in position4 and R in position5? 
   Position5: R? ✓? 
   And positions2 and3? I and G? 

   But if the secret word is? For example? ""COLAR""? Then we would get:
      C ✓? 
      Position2: I vs O? O is new? but present? Then we get '-' for I? only if I is in the word? but if not? then x? 
      Position3: G vs L? same?
      Position4: A ✓? 
      Position5: R ✓? 

   Then we know that? 

   But we are hoping to get the correct word? 

   However, it's the third guess? 

   So I'll go with ""CIGAR""

Alternatively? We can try another word that doesn't commit? Meaning? It has R and A in either order? But we need to include them? 

But we can't? Because we have to put them? 

Actually? I think ""CIGAR"" is a good choice? 

But note: we have not tried H, D, F? etc? But they are also possible? 

But we are testing I and G? 

So:

   Guess: ""cigar""

<guess>cigar</guess>

### Step-by-Step Thought Process

Given the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
- **Guess 2: carbs** → Feedback: C(✓) A(-) R(-) B(x) S(x)

We deduce:
1. **Position 1 is C** (confirmed across both guesses).
2. **R is in the word** but not in positions 2 or 3 (since both placements in positions 2 and 3 resulted in (-)).
3. **A is in the word** but not in positions 2 or 3 (since placements in positions 2 and 3 both resulted in (-)).
4. **N, E, B, S are absent** from the word (all (x)).

Thus, R and A must occupy positions 4 and 5 in some order:
- Option A: R in position 4, A in position 5 (word pattern: C _ _ R A)
- Option B: A in position 4, R in position 5 (word pattern: C _ _ A R)

Positions 2 and 3 must be filled with:
- Letters not eliminated (avoid N, E, B, S).
- Letters not A or R (since A/R cannot be in position 2 or 3).
- New common letters to maximize information.

For this guess:
- We test **Option B** (A in position 4, R in position 5) because it generates common words like ""CIGAR"" or ""COLAR"".
- We choose **""CIGAR""** (C I G A R):
  - Tests I (new vowel) in position 2.
  - Tests G (new consonant) in position 3.
  - Tests A in position 4 (if ✓, confirms Option B is correct).
  - Tests R in position 5 (if ✓, confirms placement).
- This uses valid letters (not eliminated) and prioritizes common English words.

If the secret word has A in position 4 and R in position 5 (e.g., ""CIGAR""), this guess could solve the puzzle. Otherwise, the feedback will clarify the last positions and letters 2–3.

<guess>cigar</guess>",cigar,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is in the correct position (position 1).
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N and E are not in the word.

Guess 2: carbs -> C(✓) A(-) R(-) B(x) S(x)
Interpretation:
- C is again correct in position 1 (as expected).
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (since we got '-' for position 2).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed it in position 3 and got '-').
- B and S are not in the word.

Synthesizing information:
1. The secret word starts with C (position 1).
2. The word contains R, but not in positions 2 or 3 (since both guesses placed R in positions 2 and 3 and got '-' each time). So R must be in position 4 or 5.
3. The word contains A, but not in positions 2 or 3 (from guess2 A in position2: '-', guess1 A in position3: '-'). So A must be in position 4 or 5.
4. The word does NOT contain: N, E, B, S.

Since positions 4 and 5 must contain both R and A, but they are two positions, we have two possibilities:
- Either R is in position 4 and A in position 5, or
- R is in position 5 and A in position 4.

However, note that the word may also have repeated letters? But we don't have evidence of that yet? We only have one instance of each so far? So we'll assume for now that R and A appear once? But we need to consider both orders? 

Additionally, positions 2 and 3 are still unknown? But we know they cannot contain N, E, B, S? And they must be letters that haven't been eliminated? 

So the word structure is: 
   C _ _ _ ? ?
   Where the last two positions are some order of R and A? 
   And positions 2 and 3 must be filled with letters that are not among the eliminated ones (N, E, B, S) and also not repeating? 

We also need to consider that we haven't tested many vowels? We know A is in the word? Remaining vowels? We have tried E? Eliminated? So remaining vowels: O, I, U? But also Y? 

Now, we must make a third guess. We want to test:
  - The order of R and A in the last two positions? 
  - The letters in positions 2 and 3? 

We can try to fill positions 4 and 5 with either R then A? or A then R? And pick letters for positions 2 and 3 that are common? And have not been eliminated? 

Possible words:

Option 1: Assume position 4 is R and position 5 is A? Then the word: C _ _ R A? 
  We need two letters for positions 2 and 3? And these letters must not be N,E,B,S? Also, the whole word must be valid? 

Option 2: Assume position 4 is A and position 5 is R? Then: C _ _ A R? 

We don't know which? So we can make a guess that tests one of these two orderings? 

Let's list possible words? 

First, letters eliminated: N, E, B, S? Cannot be in the word? 
Also, we have tried: C, R, A? We know they are in? We want to test new letters? 

For position 2 and 3? Let us pick common consonants that haven't been tried? and vowels not eliminated? 

Common letters: T, L, P, D, M, H, Y, etc? 

Possible words for option 1 (C _ _ R A): 
   Examples: 
      ""CITRA"" -> C I T R A? 
      ""CUPRA""? 
      ""CYRRA""? Not common? 

   Valid words: 
      ""CLARA"": but note? We tried A again? And we know A is in position5? So structure: C L A R A? But that would be two A's? Because we are putting A in position3 and position5? But: 
        - We have no feedback that says A cannot be in multiple positions? 
        - But in our first guess, we guessed A in position3? And got '-' meaning A is in the word but not position3? If the word had an A in position5? Then we would have gotten '-' for the A we guessed? Not for position3? 
        - However, if the word has two A's? Then in guess1: we guessed A in position3? and there is an A in position5? that would cause the '-'? Because one A is present? 
        - Similarly, in guess2: we guessed A in position2? If there are two A's? Then we get '-'? 
        - So we cannot rule out two A's? 

      But let me check? In ""CLARA"": 
        C L A R A? 
        But wait: position3 is A? And our feedback from the first guess said A is not in position3? So if we guess ""CLARA"", we must get '-' for A in position3? Because it shouldn't be there? Or we will get feedback based on the actual? 
        If the secret word is ""CLARA"", then the A in position3 is correct? But our first guess? We guessed ""CRANE"" with A in position3? and the word has A in position3? Then we should have gotten ✓? But we didn't? We got '-'? Meaning the A we guessed? Is in the word? But not in position3? So if ""CLARA"" were the secret word? Then in guess1 (""CRANE""? positions C R A N E) vs ""CLARA""? 
          Position1: C ✓ 
          Position2: R vs L? L is not R? but the secret word has R? But we guessed R in position2? Which is wrong? But R is in position4? So we get '-' for R because it's in the word? 
          Position3: A vs A? But if the secret word is ""CLARA"": position3 is A? So we would have gotten ✓ for A in position3? But we didn't; we got '-'? So ""CLARA"" cannot be the secret word? Because we got '-' for A in position3? meaning that at the time? there was no A in position3? 

      Therefore, the secret word does not have A in position3? So any word we guess? We should not put A in position3? 

      Similarly, we know A cannot be in position3? So ""CLARA"" is invalid? Because it would force A in position3? 

      So we avoid putting A in position3? And similarly? R not in position2 or 3? 

Therefore, in our guess for positions 2 and 3? We must use letters that are not A? and not R? And also avoid N,E,B,S? 

So let's try ""C _ _ R A"": 
   Positions 2 and 3? Must be letters not eliminated? And not A, R? 

   Possible common words: 
     ""CITRA"": C I T R A? 
        I and T? are new? 
     ""CUPRA""? Not common? 
     ""CIGAR""? But G? and then R? No, that would be C I G A R? which is 5 letters? But the last A is missing? Wait? 

     ""CIGAR"" is C I G A R? Then positions:
        Position1: C
        Position2: I
        Position3: G
        Position4: A? 
        Position5: R? 
        That's option2: A in position4 and R in position5? 

   Actually, let us form two possible templates 

   Template1 (R in position4, then A in position5): C _ _ R A
      We need two letters? Examples: 
        ""COBRA"": O and B? But B is eliminated? 
        Not viable? 

      ""CYMRA"": Not common? 
      ""CAPRA"": C A P R A? But then we have A in position2? We already know from guess2 that A is not in position2? So that would violate? And also, the word ""CAPRA""? 
      ""DICRA"" - not a word? 

      Hard to find? 

   Template2 (A in position4, R in position5): C _ _ A R? 
      Examples: 
        ""CIGAR"": C I G A R? 
        ""COLAR"": C O L A R? 
        ""COPAR"": Not common? 

      ""CIGAR"": valid? 
      ""COLAR"": valid? 

   Alternatively? Maybe R in position4 and A in position5? Then a word: but let's see? ""CERA"": No, E eliminated? 

   Since template2 seems to have more words? Let me consider ""CIGAR"" or ""COLAR""? 

   But we don't know? Also, we want to test common? 

   However, note: we also need to cover positions 2 and 3? With new letters? To get more information? 

   So let's pick one? 

   Potential words: 
      ""CIGAR"": letters: C, I, G, A, R? 
          We haven't tried I, G? 
      ""COLAR"": C, O, L, A, R? 
          O and L are new? 

   But note: we don't know what the secret word is? So either could be? 

   However, another idea? We can also test a word that doesn't necessarily commit to an ordering? But tests both? 

   Alternatively? Since we have two possibilities for the last two positions? Maybe we can test with a word that has either R or A in the two pending positions? but not both? That would be inefficient? Because we know both are present? 

   So let's choose ""CIGAR"": 
        C I G A R? 

        We are putting A in position4? and R in position5? 
        Positions2 and3: I and G? 

        This doesn't test if R could be in position4? But we will get feedback? 

        Let's predict feedback? 
          If the secret word has A in position4 and R in position5? then:
             position4: A ✓, position5: R ✓? 
          But if the secret word has R in position4 and A in position5? then we would get for A (in position4): '-', meaning it's present? but elsewhere? and for R (in position5): '-'? meaning it's present? How about position5? We guessed R? But if the secret word has A in position5? then we'll get: 
             position4: A compared to R? since R is in position4? so we would get an 'x' for the A? because A is in the word? But not R? Wait? 

        Actually: 
          If the secret word is C X X R A? (with R in4 and A in5)? 
          Then our guess: C I G A R? 
          Position1: C ✓
          Position2: I? compared to X? (unknown)? 
          Position3: G? compared to unknown?
          Position4: A? compared to R? Since R is in the word? but not in position4? Then we get '-' for A? because A is elsewhere? But wait? A is in the word? in position5? So A in our guess? gets '-'? meaning present? 
          Position5: R? compared to A? But R is present? in position4? So R also gets '-'? 

        Therefore, we cannot tell the difference? 

        Actually, we will get for the positions 4 and5: 
           A: '-' (because present? and we guessed in wrong position? i.e., we guessed position4? but A is in5?) 
           R: '-' (because present? but in the wrong position? we guessed5? but in4?) 

        Then also? if the secret word has I or G? but we don't know? 

        But we can interpret the feedback? 

        However, we want to avoid getting '-' for both R and A? So we can know? 

        Alternatively? We might test a word that has R in position5? and A in position4? Then if the secret word has R in4 and A in5? we get the same? 

        Therefore, we must accept that? And then focus on testing positions2 and3? 

        But we have limited guesses? 

   Another option? We don't need to commit? We can choose a word that has one more vowel and common letters? 

   Let me try to think: since we have two positions? How about ""CYNAR""? Not common? 

   Actually, let me list English words matching the pattern: C???R? But we are not sure? 

   Possible words ending with R or A? 

   Given the constraints? The only possibilities I can think of are:

   Option A: ...A then R? like CIGAR, COLAR, COVER? but E eliminated? 

   Option B: ...R then A? examples: 
      ""CAPRA"": but CAPRA? with A in position2 and non-? But guess2? A not in position2? So CAPRA? cannot? because position2? A? so guess2? already told us A is not in position2? 
      ""FAUNA"": starts with F? 
      ""CHINA"": N eliminated? 
      ""CARIA""? But we don't know? 

   Actually, it's hard? 

   Another possibility? Maybe the secret word has two R's? For example? But we haven't guessed two R's? 

   Given that, I think the most likely ordering is A in position4 and R in position5? because that yields common words? 

   So words: C? ? A R? 
     With positions2 and3? Must be letters not eliminated? and not A? R? 

   So let us try: 
     C? ? A R? 
     With ? and? not in {N,E,B,S}? 

   Common: 
     ""CIGAR"" -> I and G? 
     ""COLAR"" -> O and L? 
     ""COHAR"" -> rare? 
     ""CIVAR"" -> rare? 

   Also, ""CEDAR"": E eliminated? 
        ""CEDAR"" has E? 

   So let's guess ""CIGAR""? That tests I and G? 
        Positions2: I? 
        Position3: G? 

        And if the secret word ends with AR? Then we test that? 

        Alternatively? We could guess ""COLAR""? 

        To maximize new letter coverage? We choose one that uses more common letters? 

        ""CIGAR"" uses I and G? 
        ""COLAR"" uses O and L? 

        Both seem common? 

   Since no preference? I'll pick ""COLAR""? because L is a very common letter? 

   Or maybe ""CIGAR""? 

   Let me choose ""CIGAR""? 

   But note: to avoid missing? 

   Actually? We have a chance to get it correct? If the secret word is ""CIGAR""? 

   But if not? We get feedback? 

   So guess: ""CIGAR""

But wait? In guess2 we already eliminated B and S? So if we guess ""CIGAR"", it's valid? 

So:

   Guess: C I G A R

Let me write the feedback we would expect? 
   Position1: C ✓? automatic? 
   Position4: If the secret word has A in position4? ✓? also R? 
   But note? We are guessing A in position4 and R in position5? 
   Position5: R? ✓? 
   And positions2 and3? I and G? 

   But if the secret word is? For example? ""COLAR""? Then we would get:
      C ✓? 
      Position2: I vs O? O is new? but present? Then we get '-' for I? only if I is in the word? but if not? then x? 
      Position3: G vs L? same?
      Position4: A ✓? 
      Position5: R ✓? 

   Then we know that? 

   But we are hoping to get the correct word? 

   However, it's the third guess? 

   So I'll go with ""CIGAR""

Alternatively? We can try another word that doesn't commit? Meaning? It has R and A in either order? But we need to include them? 

But we can't? Because we have to put them? 

Actually? I think ""CIGAR"" is a good choice? 

But note: we have not tried H, D, F? etc? But they are also possible? 

But we are testing I and G? 

So:

   Guess: ""cigar""

<guess>cigar</guess>### Step-by-Step Thought Process

Given the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
- **Guess 2: carbs** → Feedback: C(✓) A(-) R(-) B(x) S(x)

We deduce:
1. **Position 1 is C** (confirmed across both guesses).
2. **R is in the word** but not in positions 2 or 3 (since both placements in positions 2 and 3 resulted in (-)).
3. **A is in the word** but not in positions 2 or 3 (since placements in positions 2 and 3 both resulted in (-)).
4. **N, E, B, S are absent** from the word (all (x)).

Thus, R and A must occupy positions 4 and 5 in some order:
- Option A: R in position 4, A in position 5 (word pattern: C _ _ R A)
- Option B: A in position 4, R in position 5 (word pattern: C _ _ A R)

Positions 2 and 3 must be filled with:
- Letters not eliminated (avoid N, E, B, S).
- Letters not A or R (since A/R cannot be in position 2 or 3).
- New common letters to maximize information.

For this guess:
- We test **Option B** (A in position 4, R in position 5) because it generates common words like ""CIGAR"" or ""COLAR"".
- We choose **""CIGAR""** (C I G A R):
  - Tests I (new vowel) in position 2.
  - Tests G (new consonant) in position 3.
  - Tests A in position 4 (if ✓, confirms Option B is correct).
  - Tests R in position 5 (if ✓, confirms placement).
- This uses valid letters (not eliminated) and prioritizes common English words.

If the secret word has A in position 4 and R in position 5 (e.g., ""CIGAR""), this guess could solve the puzzle. Otherwise, the feedback will clarify the last positions and letters 2–3.",Guess 3: cigar -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) I(✓) G(✓) A(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
