We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. It covers common consonants and two vowels (A and E).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, A was in position 3 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word, A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Includes A and E (since they are in the word) but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
   - Does not include C, R, or N.

 Also, we want to test new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that:
   - Has A and E in new positions (not 3 for A and not 5 for E).
   - Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like S, T, L, I, O, etc.).

 We have 6 positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

 For the letter A: it cannot be in position 3. So it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 For the letter E: it cannot be in position 5. So it can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also want to avoid positions that might be fixed by the feedback? But we don't have any correct positions yet.

 Let's try to form a word that includes A and E and three new letters.

 Since we know A and E are in the word, we can try to place them in positions we haven't tested.

 Example possibilities for A: positions 1, 2, 4, 5. But note: if we put A in position 5, that's allowed because the feedback only said E cannot be in position 5, but A can be anywhere except 3.

 Similarly, E can be in positions 1,2,3,4.

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has A and E and three new consonants or vowels.

 One idea: ""SLATE"" - but note that we have feedback that A is in the word but not in position 3, and E is in the word but not in position 5. In ""SLATE"":
   S in position 1
   L in position 2
   A in position 3 -> but wait, we cannot put A in position 3 because the feedback said A is not in position 3. So ""SLATE"" is invalid for A at position 3.

 We must avoid putting A at position 3.

 How about ""LEAST""? 
   L, E, A, S, T.
   Positions: 
     1: L
     2: E -> E is in position 2 (which is allowed because E can be in 1,2,3,4)
     3: A -> but A cannot be in position 3! So that's invalid.

 How about ""STALE""?
   S, T, A, L, E.
   Position 3: A -> again, A in position 3 is not allowed.

 We need to avoid position 3 for A.

 How about ""STEAL""?
   S, T, E, A, L.
   Position 1: S
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: E -> allowed for E (since E can be in 3)
   Position 4: A -> allowed for A (since A can be in 4)
   Position 5: L

 This word: 
   - Does not have C, R, or N (good).
   - Includes A and E, and A is not in position 3 (it's in 4) and E is not in position 5 (it's in 3) -> so that's okay.

 But note: we are also testing S, T, and L.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ADIEU"" but that has two vowels and we already know two vowels (A and E). Also, we have feedback that E is in the word, so we don't need to test more vowels necessarily? But we don't know if there are more.

 However, ""ADIEU"" has A and E and also I and U. But we are limited by the positions: 
   A in position 1: allowed.
   D in 2
   I in 3
   E in 4: allowed (since E can be in 4) 
   U in 5: but E cannot be in 5? That's okay because E is in 4, and U is new.

 But note: we don't know if the word has I or U. And we are avoiding C, R, N.

 However, we have only two known letters (A and E) and we want to test more common consonants.

 Another idea: ""PASTE""?
   P, A, S, T, E.
   Position 2: A -> allowed (since A can be in 2)
   Position 5: E -> but feedback said E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E in position 5.

 Therefore, ""PASTE"" is invalid because E is in position 5.

 How about ""PASTY""? That doesn't have E? But we know E is in the word, so we must include E.

 We must include both A and E.

 Let me try to list words that have A and E, and avoid positions 3 for A and 5 for E, and avoid C, R, N.

 Some options:

 Option 1: ""STEAL"" -> as above: S, T, E, A, L -> positions: E at 3 (allowed), A at 4 (allowed), and E not at 5 (good), A not at 3 (good).

 Option 2: ""SLATE"" is invalid because A is at 3.

 Option 3: ""LATTE"" -> but has double T? And A at position 2: allowed, E at position 5: not allowed.

 Option 4: ""TALES"" -> 
   T, A, L, E, S.
   A at position 2: allowed.
   E at position 4: allowed (since E can be in 4) -> but wait, the word ends with S? 
   However, we have to check: the feedback said E is not in position 5? In ""TALES"", E is in position 4 and S in 5 -> that's okay.

 But note: in ""TALES"", A is in position 2 (allowed) and E in position 4 (allowed). Also, no C, R, N.

 However, we have already tried the letter A and E, and we are testing T, L, S.

 But we also want to maximize new letters. Both ""STEAL"" and ""TALES"" use S, T, L, E, A.

 Another option: ""SAUTE"" -> 
   S, A, U, T, E.
   A in position 2: allowed.
   E in position 5: not allowed! So invalid.

 How about ""SALET""? (a type of helmet) -> 
   S, A, L, E, T.
   A in position 2: allowed.
   E in position 4: allowed.
   But note: we have A in position 2 and E in position 4. Also, we avoid position 3 for A and 5 for E? Actually, E is in 4 and the last letter is T, so E is not in 5 -> good.

 However, ""SALET"" is a valid word? It might be obscure.

 We should stick to common words.

 Another common word: ""LAPSE"" -> 
   L, A, P, S, E.
   A in position 2: allowed.
   E in position 5: not allowed -> invalid.

 How about ""LEAPS""? 
   L, E, A, P, S.
   E in position 2: allowed.
   A in position 3: not allowed! -> invalid.

 How about ""PLEAD""? 
   P, L, E, A, D.
   E in position 3: allowed.
   A in position 4: allowed.
   And no E in 5 -> good.

 But we haven't tested S or T, which are common.

 Considering the above, ""STEAL"" seems a good choice because:
   - It uses common letters S, T, L (which we haven't tried) and we already know A and E are in the word.
   - It places A and E in allowed positions: E in 3 (which is a new position for E) and A in 4 (new for A).

 Alternatively, ""TALES"" is also good.

 But note: we have feedback that A is in the word but not in position 3, and E is in the word but not in position 5. We don't know if they are in other positions. By placing them in new positions, we can get more information.

 Let me choose ""STEAL"".

 However, we must be cautious: what if the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

 So, I'll go with ""STEAL"".

 But wait: we have feedback that A is in the word and we are putting it in position 4. If the feedback comes back with A in the correct position, then we know. Similarly for E.

 Also, we are testing S, T, and L.

 If we get feedback that S, T, or L are in the word, that will help.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""STEAL"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (as indicated by ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (as indicated by ""-"").
- C, R, and N are not in the word (as indicated by ""x"").

For the next guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing A in position 3 and E in position 5.
- Exclude C, R, and N entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L) to gather more information.

The word ""steal"" fits these criteria:
- Places A in position 4 (avoiding position 3).
- Places E in position 3 (avoiding position 5).
- Includes new letters S, T, and L.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help identify positions for A and E while testing three new consonants.

 We must avoid putting A at position 3.

<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, A was in position 3 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word, A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Includes A and E (since they are in the word) but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
   - Does not include C, R, or N.

 Also, we want to test new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that:
   - Has A and E in new positions (not 3 for A and not 5 for E).
   - Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like S, T, L, I, O, etc.).

 We have 6 positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

 For the letter A: it cannot be in position 3. So it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 For the letter E: it cannot be in position 5. So it can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also want to avoid positions that might be fixed by the feedback? But we don't have any correct positions yet.

 Let's try to form a word that includes A and E and three new letters.

 Since we know A and E are in the word, we can try to place them in positions we haven't tested.

 Example possibilities for A: positions 1, 2, 4, 5. But note: if we put A in position 5, that's allowed because the feedback only said E cannot be in position 5, but A can be anywhere except 3.

 Similarly, E can be in positions 1,2,3,4.

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has A and E and three new consonants or vowels.

 One idea: ""SLATE"" - but note that we have feedback that A is in the word but not in position 3, and E is in the word but not in position 5. In ""SLATE"":
   S in position 1
   L in position 2
   A in position 3 -> but wait, we cannot put A in position 3 because the feedback said A is not in position 3. So ""SLATE"" is invalid for A at position 3.

 We must avoid putting A at position 3.

 How about ""LEAST""? 
   L, E, A, S, T.
   Positions: 
     1: L
     2: E -> E is in position 2 (which is allowed because E can be in 1,2,3,4)
     3: A -> but A cannot be in position 3! So that's invalid.

 How about ""STALE""?
   S, T, A, L, E.
   Position 3: A -> again, A in position 3 is not allowed.

 We need to avoid position 3 for A.

 How about ""STEAL""?
   S, T, E, A, L.
   Position 1: S
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: E -> allowed for E (since E can be in 3)
   Position 4: A -> allowed for A (since A can be in 4)
   Position 5: L

 This word: 
   - Does not have C, R, or N (good).
   - Includes A and E, and A is not in position 3 (it's in 4) and E is not in position 5 (it's in 3) -> so that's okay.

 But note: we are also testing S, T, and L.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ADIEU"" but that has two vowels and we already know two vowels (A and E). Also, we have feedback that E is in the word, so we don't need to test more vowels necessarily? But we don't know if there are more.

 However, ""ADIEU"" has A and E and also I and U. But we are limited by the positions: 
   A in position 1: allowed.
   D in 2
   I in 3
   E in 4: allowed (since E can be in 4) 
   U in 5: but E cannot be in 5? That's okay because E is in 4, and U is new.

 But note: we don't know if the word has I or U. And we are avoiding C, R, N.

 However, we have only two known letters (A and E) and we want to test more common consonants.

 Another idea: ""PASTE""?
   P, A, S, T, E.
   Position 2: A -> allowed (since A can be in 2)
   Position 5: E -> but feedback said E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E in position 5.

 Therefore, ""PASTE"" is invalid because E is in position 5.

 How about ""PASTY""? That doesn't have E? But we know E is in the word, so we must include E.

 We must include both A and E.

 Let me try to list words that have A and E, and avoid positions 3 for A and 5 for E, and avoid C, R, N.

 Some options:

 Option 1: ""STEAL"" -> as above: S, T, E, A, L -> positions: E at 3 (allowed), A at 4 (allowed), and E not at 5 (good), A not at 3 (good).

 Option 2: ""SLATE"" is invalid because A is at 3.

 Option 3: ""LATTE"" -> but has double T? And A at position 2: allowed, E at position 5: not allowed.

 Option 4: ""TALES"" -> 
   T, A, L, E, S.
   A at position 2: allowed.
   E at position 4: allowed (since E can be in 4) -> but wait, the word ends with S? 
   However, we have to check: the feedback said E is not in position 5? In ""TALES"", E is in position 4 and S in 5 -> that's okay.

 But note: in ""TALES"", A is in position 2 (allowed) and E in position 4 (allowed). Also, no C, R, N.

 However, we have already tried the letter A and E, and we are testing T, L, S.

 But we also want to maximize new letters. Both ""STEAL"" and ""TALES"" use S, T, L, E, A.

 Another option: ""SAUTE"" -> 
   S, A, U, T, E.
   A in position 2: allowed.
   E in position 5: not allowed! So invalid.

 How about ""SALET""? (a type of helmet) -> 
   S, A, L, E, T.
   A in position 2: allowed.
   E in position 4: allowed.
   But note: we have A in position 2 and E in position 4. Also, we avoid position 3 for A and 5 for E? Actually, E is in 4 and the last letter is T, so E is not in 5 -> good.

 However, ""SALET"" is a valid word? It might be obscure.

 We should stick to common words.

 Another common word: ""LAPSE"" -> 
   L, A, P, S, E.
   A in position 2: allowed.
   E in position 5: not allowed -> invalid.

 How about ""LEAPS""? 
   L, E, A, P, S.
   E in position 2: allowed.
   A in position 3: not allowed! -> invalid.

 How about ""PLEAD""? 
   P, L, E, A, D.
   E in position 3: allowed.
   A in position 4: allowed.
   And no E in 5 -> good.

 But we haven't tested S or T, which are common.

 Considering the above, ""STEAL"" seems a good choice because:
   - It uses common letters S, T, L (which we haven't tried) and we already know A and E are in the word.
   - It places A and E in allowed positions: E in 3 (which is a new position for E) and A in 4 (new for A).

 Alternatively, ""TALES"" is also good.

 But note: we have feedback that A is in the word but not in position 3, and E is in the word but not in position 5. We don't know if they are in other positions. By placing them in new positions, we can get more information.

 Let me choose ""STEAL"".

 However, we must be cautious: what if the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

 So, I'll go with ""STEAL"".

 But wait: we have feedback that A is in the word and we are putting it in position 4. If the feedback comes back with A in the correct position, then we know. Similarly for E.

 Also, we are testing S, T, and L.

 If we get feedback that S, T, or L are in the word, that will help.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""STEAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (as indicated by ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (as indicated by ""-"").
- C, R, and N are not in the word (as indicated by ""x"").

For the next guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing A in position 3 and E in position 5.
- Exclude C, R, and N entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L) to gather more information.

The word ""steal"" fits these criteria:
- Places A in position 4 (avoiding position 3).
- Places E in position 3 (avoiding position 5).
- Includes new letters S, T, and L.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help identify positions for A and E while testing three new consonants.

We've had two guesses and their feedback:

First guess: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word but not at position 3
  N: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, wrong position) -> E in the word but not at position 5

Second guess: ""steal""
  S: - (in word, wrong position) -> S is in the word, but not at position 1
  T: x (not in word) -> T is not in the word
  E: - (in word, wrong position) -> E is in the word but not at position 3 (since in ""steal"", E is at position 3)
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> A is in the word but not at position 4 (since in ""steal"", A is at position 4)
  L: x (not in word) -> L is not in the word

Now we know:
- The word contains A, E, S (since they have '-' in the feedback).
- The word does not contain C, R, N, T, L (all marked 'x').
- Positions where letters cannot be:
  - A not at 3 (from crane) and not at 4 (from steal)
  - E not at 5 (from crane) and not at 3 (from steal)
  - S not at 1 (from steal)

Also, note that E and A must be in the word, so they appear somewhere else.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, E, A, L. So the absent letters are C, R, N, T, L.

The secret word must contain S, A, E, and two more letters that we haven't guessed yet (or we might have duplicates, but no indication so far).

We know the word has 5 distinct letters? Possibly, but duplicates are allowed. Since we have no duplicate feedback, let's assume no duplicates for now until we have evidence.

From the feedback, we have three confirmed letters: A, E, S. Therefore, we need two more letters.

We need to think of a word that:
- Contains A, E, S (since they are in the word) but avoids positions:
  - S not at 1
  - A not at 3 and 4
  - E not at 3 and 5
- Does not contain C, R, N, T, L (since they are absent)

We also want to test new common letters to identify the remaining letters.

Available common consonants: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Vowels: we already have A and E, so we don't necessarily need more vowels? But there might be another vowel.

We know the positions that are disallowed for the letters:

Position constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be S (from feedback of steal: S not at 1)
- Position 3: cannot be A or E (from crane: A not at 3; steal: E not at 3 -> so E not at 3 and A not at 3)
- Position 4: cannot be A (from steal: A not at 4)
- Position 5: cannot be E (from crane: E not at 5)

We don't have constraints on position 2 yet.

For E, it cannot be at 3 or 5. So E can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.
For A, it cannot be at 3 or 4. So A can be at positions 1, 2, or 5.
For S, it cannot be at 1. So S can be at 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We need to form a word with A, E, S, and two new letters.

Let's list possibilities:

Since E can be at 1, 2, 4; A at 1,2,5; S at 2,3,4,5.

But note: A and E cannot occupy the same position? So they must be in different positions.

We should try to place A, E, S in the remaining possible positions and then fill the other two letters with new ones.

One idea: place E in position 1. Then A can be in position 2 or 5. And S can be in 3,4, or 5 (if A not at 5) or in 2,3,4 if A at 5.

But we need a real word.

How about words starting with E? Then we have E at 1. Then for position 2, we can have A or another letter.

Example: ""E..."", and we know it must contain A and S.

Common words: ""EASTS"" has duplicates? Or ""EASEL"", but L is absent so invalid.

Words starting with E and having A and S, without C,R,N,T,L.

Possible: ""EASES"" but duplicates and also S is repeated. But we don't know if duplicates exist.

But let's think of words without duplicate letters to test new letters.

Another idea: since we don't know two letters, we can try a word that includes common remaining letters.

For example, include B or D or G or P.

Try placing S at position 2? Then position 1 can be something new.

But S cannot be at 1, position 1 must be a new letter.

Similarly, we have to avoid the forbidden positions.

Try a word with pattern:

Position 1: an available new letter (say B, D, G, ...) 
Position 2: could be A or E? Or S? 
Position 3: cannot be A or E, so must be a new letter or S? But position 3 can be S? Yes, because S can be at 3 (no constraint against S at 3).
Position 4: cannot be A, so new letter or E or S.
Position 5: cannot be E, so new letter or A or S.

But note we have to use exactly one of each of A, E, S? Unless duplicates.

We'll try to avoid duplicates for now.

Let me try to make a word with E in position 2? Then A must be in 1,2,5 but position 2 is taken by E so A at 1 or 5.

But position 1: if A can be at 1? Yes. Otherwise A at 5.

Similarly, S can be at 3,4,5 (if not taken).

Option: 
Position 1: A -> then word starts with A? But we have E at 2? Then positions: A, E, ?, ?, ?
Then we need an S and two new letters.

But E is at 2? That's allowed since E can be in 2? Yes. And A at 1 is allowed? Yes.

Then we have: A, E, ....? 

The word: A, E, ... and we need S and two more.

Words: AEGIS? But G and I. Or AEONS? But we know N is absent. Or AEGIS? But I is a vowel.

But note we haven't banned I, U, O.

We can use vowels.

A better approach: we know the forbidden letters: C, R, N, T, L. So we can use any other letter.

List of possible words containing A, E, S.

Since we don't know the positions, but we have constraints.

Try ""BASED"": 
  B, A, S, E, D.
  Check positions:
    Position 1: B (new, allowed)
    Position 2: A -> but A cannot be at position 2? Wait we have no constraints on position 2 for A? Actually, from feedback, A cannot be at position 3 or 4. Position 2 is allowed? Yes. So A at 2 is okay?
    Position 3: S? But we have constraint: position 3 cannot be A or E. S is allowed? Yes.
    Position 4: E? But E cannot be at position 3? Position 4 for E: possible? Yes, because we only have constraints for E at 3 and 5? So E at 4 is fine? 
    Position 5: D (new)

Now check against the constraints:
- S is in the word: yes, at position 3 -> S can be at 3? (we only know S not at 1, but 3 is okay).
- A at 2: allowed (since not forbidden)
- E at 4: allowed (not 3 or 5).
Also, doesn't contain forbidden letters: no C,R,N,T,L.

But note: we need to confirm positions: 
  A at position 2: is that allowed? From previous, the constraints on A are: not at position 3 (from crane) and not at position 4 (from steal). Position 2 is new and allowed? Yes.
  E? In crane we knew E was not at 5, and from steal we knew E was not at 3. Position 4 is new? Yes, allowed.

So ""BASED"" seems good.

Another option: ""ASKED"", but K is new? But position constraints? 
  Position 1: A -> allowed? Yes (A can be at 1)
  Position 2: S -> allowed? But we don't have constraint on position 2. Also S can be at 2? Because S only forbidden at 1? So it's okay? Then 
  A at position 1: that's fine (no constraint against position 1 for A? Only against 3 and 4)
  S at position 2: ok
  K at position 3: since position 3 can have S? Or a new letter? But we must note that position 3 cannot be A or E? So K is fine? And E?

But wait: we must include E! In ""ASKED"", we have A,S,K,E,D -> E in position 4? Then D at 5.

Check E: position 4 is allowed? Yes because E can be at 4? And A at 1? Also no forbidden letters.

But we have constraint from steal: E not at 3? But here E is at 4? Good.

But let me compare with the constraints:

For ""ASKED"":
  Position 1: A -> allowed? Yes (A not forbidden at 1)
  Position 2: S -> allowed? Yes (S not at 1 is only constraint, so position 2 ok)
  Position 3: K -> allowed? Position 3: since we only know that it cannot be A or E? Then K (new) is ok.
  Position 4: E -> allowed? Because E cannot be at 3 or 5? Position 4 is allowed? Yes.
  Position 5: D.

Similarly, no forbidden letters.

But note: we know S is in the word? Yes? And we have S at position 2? Which is new? We only knew S was in the word from the '-' in steal at position 1? So we know S is somewhere else? And now we are testing S at position 2? That's okay? But we also might find out if S is at 2? Correctly?

But both ""BASED"" and ""ASKED"" are possible? But wait, we must consider the feedback? We know the secret word? Actually, no.

But we need to maximize information? Or just guess a word that fits.

The goal is to find the secret word.

But if we guess ""BASED"", it might be? But also we test B and D.

Similarly, ""ASKED"" tests K and D.

Which is better? B and K are both common, but we need to pick one.

Alternatively, we can try to use the letter P? Because P is common? Consider ""PHASE"", but H is new? And E at position 5? E cannot be at 5? So invalid.

Or ""SHADE"": 
  S, H, A, D, E.
  Positions:
    S at 1: but feedback from steal says S cannot be at 1? So invalid? Because in first position we have S? But the feedback for steal said S is in the word but not at position 1? Therefore, if we put S at 1 in a new word, that would be wrong? But we know it's wrong? So why try? So we cannot start with S? Therefore, ""SHADE"" has S at position 1, which is forbidden? Since we know S doesn't belong at position 1? So that word would be invalid? Not the secret word? So it's okay to avoid? We don't want to guess an invalid? Actually, we can guess words that we know are impossible? But why? Let me clarify: we can guess any 5-letter word? But if the secret word doesn't start with S? Why guess a word with S at 1 when we know it's wrong? We shouldn't? We must avoid positions that are impossible.

Therefore, we must avoid:
  Putting S at position 1 (from feedback in steal: S(-) meaning S is not at 1? Wait, the feedback only tells us that S is in the word but not at position 1? So for the secret word, S is at some position other than 1? Therefore, we cannot put S at 1.

So we must avoid S at 1, T at 2? But T is absent? We know T is absent? In the second guess, T was at position 2 and was marked x? So T is not in the word? So we don't use T.

Similarly, we must avoid the letters we know are absent.

Therefore, ""SHADE"" is invalid? Because S at 1 is disallowed? Our guess must have S not at position 1? Therefore, we cannot use words that have S at 1.

In fact, our guess must have S at position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Now, back to our candidate words:

Option 1: ""BASED""
  B at 1? B is new? Yes.
  A at 2? Allowed? Yes? We have no constraint against A at position 2? Only at 3 and 4.
  S at 3? Allowed? Yes? Because S was not at 1? Position 3 is okay.
  E at 4? Allowed? We know E is not at position 3? But 4 is okay? And not at position 5? So 4 is allowed.
  D at 5? New? And not forbidden.

Option 2: ""ASKED""
  A at 1? Allowed? Yes? (A can be at position 1? Because only constraints are not at 3 or 4)
  S at 2? Allowed? Yes? (S not at 1? Position 2 is fine)
  K at 3? Allowed? Because no constraints? And cannot be A or E? So a new letter is okay? Yes.
  E at 4? Allowed? Yes.
  D at 5.

Option 3: ""BAKES""? 
  B at 1? 
  A at 2?
  K at 3?
  E at 4?
  S at 5? Then S at position 5? Which is allowed? Because S not at 1? Position 5 is fine? And E at 4? Is that okay? No constraint? And A at 2? Okay? And we have A, E, S included.

But ""BAKES"" has E at position 4? Allowed? And S at position 5? Allowed.

But the word ""BAKES""? Valid.

Another candidate: ""WEARS""? But W? And E at position 2? And A at position 3? But A cannot be at position 3? So invalid.

Or ""SEAMS"": S at 1? Disallowed? Cannot.

Therefore, I have ""BASED"" and ""ASKED"", both seem valid.

Which to pick? Both test two new letters. We don't know if they will be present or not? So we'll get feedback.

To avoid missing, maybe pick one? I'll go with ""BASED"" because B is a common letter? But K is also common? Or perhaps they are equally common.

But note: from the first guess ""crane"", we had A at position 3? But the secret word had A? And from ""steal"", A at position 4? But both were wrong. So A must be in positions 1, 2, or 5? Similarly E must be in 1, 2, or 4.

In ""BASED"": A at position 2? That's one of the possibilities? It might reveal if A is at 2? Similarly, in ""ASKED"": A at position 1? Also possible.

But let me see if we can distinguish? Maybe not, so we choose arbitrarily.

Alternatively, we can consider letters that haven't been used: in ""BASED"", we use B and D? In ""ASKED"", K and D.

Maybe we can pick one? I'll pick ""BASED"".

Another word? How about ""PAVED""? P and V? Then E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? So invalid.

Or ""SHAPE"": S at 1? Disallowed.

Or ""OASIS"": O? And duplicate S? But we know S only one? Not necessarily? And E? We must include E? Oh, we forgot: the word must have E? ""OASIS"" does not have E? So invalid.

We must include A, E, S.

Another word: ""BEATS""? But T is absent? Cannot.

""GAMES""? M? Then S? But E must be? And A? 
  G, A, M, E, S -> 
    A at position 2? Allowed? 
    E at position 4? Allowed? 
    S at position 5? Allowed? 
    But does not contain T? T is absent? So no T? So valid? 
  But we know T is absent? That's fine? Letters G,M? 

Let's list more options? But we don't know? 

Also, note: in ""BASED"", we have E at position 4? Which we haven't tested before? Similarly, A at position 2? New.

Similarly for ""GAMES"": similar? E at 4? A at 2? 

But we don't need to use uncommon letters? We can pick BASED? Which is common.

Also, ""BASED"": uses B, A, S, E, D.

We haven't tried B, D before.

So I think ""BASED"" is a good choice? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""BASED"".

But let me confirm the positions:

""BASED"" is spelled B-A-S-E-D.

Position 1: B
Position 2: A
Position 3: S
Position 4: E
Position 5: D

Constraints:
- A at 2: not forbidden? Forbidden positions for A: 3 and 4? Position 2 is fine? Yes.
- E at 4: forbidden positions for E: 3 and 5? Position 4 is fine? Yes.
- S at 3: forbidden positions for S: only position 1? Position 3 is fine? Yes.

Nothing in position 1 or 5? No constraint.

And letters: absent letters: we avoid C,R,N,T,L? We used B,S,E,A,D? None forbidden? Except we know S,E,A are in? B and D are new? Valid.

So <guess>based</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- Confirmed letters in the secret word: **A**, **E**, **S** (as indicated by ""-"" in feedback, meaning they exist but were in the wrong positions).
- Absent letters: **C**, **R**, **N**, **T**, **L** (as indicated by ""x"").
- Position constraints:
  - A cannot be at position 3 (from ""crane"") or 4 (from ""steal"").
  - E cannot be at position 3 (from ""steal"") or 5 (from ""crane"").
  - S cannot be at position 1 (from ""steal"").

For this guess:
- Must include **A**, **E**, and **S** to probe new positions.
- Avoid using C, R, N, T, L.
- Consider new common letters (e.g., B, D, G, H, K) to test for presence.
- Ensure positions respect constraints:  
  - A can be at positions 1, 2, or 5.  
  - E can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.  
  - S can be at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Selected guess: **BASED**  
- **B** at position 1: New letter (tests for B).  
- **A** at position 2: Allowed (not position 3 or 4).  
- **S** at position 3: Allowed (not position 1).  
- **E** at position 4: Allowed (not position 3 or 5).  
- **D** at position 5: New letter (tests for D).  

This guess:
- Includes required letters (A, E, S).
- Avoids forbidden letters and positions.
- Tests B and D for presence/position.

<guess>based</guess>",based,"We've had two guesses and their feedback:

First guess: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word but not at position 3
  N: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, wrong position) -> E in the word but not at position 5

Second guess: ""steal""
  S: - (in word, wrong position) -> S is in the word, but not at position 1
  T: x (not in word) -> T is not in the word
  E: - (in word, wrong position) -> E is in the word but not at position 3 (since in ""steal"", E is at position 3)
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> A is in the word but not at position 4 (since in ""steal"", A is at position 4)
  L: x (not in word) -> L is not in the word

Now we know:
- The word contains A, E, S (since they have '-' in the feedback).
- The word does not contain C, R, N, T, L (all marked 'x').
- Positions where letters cannot be:
  - A not at 3 (from crane) and not at 4 (from steal)
  - E not at 5 (from crane) and not at 3 (from steal)
  - S not at 1 (from steal)

Also, note that E and A must be in the word, so they appear somewhere else.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, E, A, L. So the absent letters are C, R, N, T, L.

The secret word must contain S, A, E, and two more letters that we haven't guessed yet (or we might have duplicates, but no indication so far).

We know the word has 5 distinct letters? Possibly, but duplicates are allowed. Since we have no duplicate feedback, let's assume no duplicates for now until we have evidence.

From the feedback, we have three confirmed letters: A, E, S. Therefore, we need two more letters.

We need to think of a word that:
- Contains A, E, S (since they are in the word) but avoids positions:
  - S not at 1
  - A not at 3 and 4
  - E not at 3 and 5
- Does not contain C, R, N, T, L (since they are absent)

We also want to test new common letters to identify the remaining letters.

Available common consonants: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Vowels: we already have A and E, so we don't necessarily need more vowels? But there might be another vowel.

We know the positions that are disallowed for the letters:

Position constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be S (from feedback of steal: S not at 1)
- Position 3: cannot be A or E (from crane: A not at 3; steal: E not at 3 -> so E not at 3 and A not at 3)
- Position 4: cannot be A (from steal: A not at 4)
- Position 5: cannot be E (from crane: E not at 5)

We don't have constraints on position 2 yet.

For E, it cannot be at 3 or 5. So E can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.
For A, it cannot be at 3 or 4. So A can be at positions 1, 2, or 5.
For S, it cannot be at 1. So S can be at 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We need to form a word with A, E, S, and two new letters.

Let's list possibilities:

Since E can be at 1, 2, 4; A at 1,2,5; S at 2,3,4,5.

But note: A and E cannot occupy the same position? So they must be in different positions.

We should try to place A, E, S in the remaining possible positions and then fill the other two letters with new ones.

One idea: place E in position 1. Then A can be in position 2 or 5. And S can be in 3,4, or 5 (if A not at 5) or in 2,3,4 if A at 5.

But we need a real word.

How about words starting with E? Then we have E at 1. Then for position 2, we can have A or another letter.

Example: ""E..."", and we know it must contain A and S.

Common words: ""EASTS"" has duplicates? Or ""EASEL"", but L is absent so invalid.

Words starting with E and having A and S, without C,R,N,T,L.

Possible: ""EASES"" but duplicates and also S is repeated. But we don't know if duplicates exist.

But let's think of words without duplicate letters to test new letters.

Another idea: since we don't know two letters, we can try a word that includes common remaining letters.

For example, include B or D or G or P.

Try placing S at position 2? Then position 1 can be something new.

But S cannot be at 1, position 1 must be a new letter.

Similarly, we have to avoid the forbidden positions.

Try a word with pattern:

Position 1: an available new letter (say B, D, G, ...) 
Position 2: could be A or E? Or S? 
Position 3: cannot be A or E, so must be a new letter or S? But position 3 can be S? Yes, because S can be at 3 (no constraint against S at 3).
Position 4: cannot be A, so new letter or E or S.
Position 5: cannot be E, so new letter or A or S.

But note we have to use exactly one of each of A, E, S? Unless duplicates.

We'll try to avoid duplicates for now.

Let me try to make a word with E in position 2? Then A must be in 1,2,5 but position 2 is taken by E so A at 1 or 5.

But position 1: if A can be at 1? Yes. Otherwise A at 5.

Similarly, S can be at 3,4,5 (if not taken).

Option: 
Position 1: A -> then word starts with A? But we have E at 2? Then positions: A, E, ?, ?, ?
Then we need an S and two new letters.

But E is at 2? That's allowed since E can be in 2? Yes. And A at 1 is allowed? Yes.

Then we have: A, E, ....? 

The word: A, E, ... and we need S and two more.

Words: AEGIS? But G and I. Or AEONS? But we know N is absent. Or AEGIS? But I is a vowel.

But note we haven't banned I, U, O.

We can use vowels.

A better approach: we know the forbidden letters: C, R, N, T, L. So we can use any other letter.

List of possible words containing A, E, S.

Since we don't know the positions, but we have constraints.

Try ""BASED"": 
  B, A, S, E, D.
  Check positions:
    Position 1: B (new, allowed)
    Position 2: A -> but A cannot be at position 2? Wait we have no constraints on position 2 for A? Actually, from feedback, A cannot be at position 3 or 4. Position 2 is allowed? Yes. So A at 2 is okay?
    Position 3: S? But we have constraint: position 3 cannot be A or E. S is allowed? Yes.
    Position 4: E? But E cannot be at position 3? Position 4 for E: possible? Yes, because we only have constraints for E at 3 and 5? So E at 4 is fine? 
    Position 5: D (new)

Now check against the constraints:
- S is in the word: yes, at position 3 -> S can be at 3? (we only know S not at 1, but 3 is okay).
- A at 2: allowed (since not forbidden)
- E at 4: allowed (not 3 or 5).
Also, doesn't contain forbidden letters: no C,R,N,T,L.

But note: we need to confirm positions: 
  A at position 2: is that allowed? From previous, the constraints on A are: not at position 3 (from crane) and not at position 4 (from steal). Position 2 is new and allowed? Yes.
  E? In crane we knew E was not at 5, and from steal we knew E was not at 3. Position 4 is new? Yes, allowed.

So ""BASED"" seems good.

Another option: ""ASKED"", but K is new? But position constraints? 
  Position 1: A -> allowed? Yes (A can be at 1)
  Position 2: S -> allowed? But we don't have constraint on position 2. Also S can be at 2? Because S only forbidden at 1? So it's okay? Then 
  A at position 1: that's fine (no constraint against position 1 for A? Only against 3 and 4)
  S at position 2: ok
  K at position 3: since position 3 can have S? Or a new letter? But we must note that position 3 cannot be A or E? So K is fine? And E?

But wait: we must include E! In ""ASKED"", we have A,S,K,E,D -> E in position 4? Then D at 5.

Check E: position 4 is allowed? Yes because E can be at 4? And A at 1? Also no forbidden letters.

But we have constraint from steal: E not at 3? But here E is at 4? Good.

But let me compare with the constraints:

For ""ASKED"":
  Position 1: A -> allowed? Yes (A not forbidden at 1)
  Position 2: S -> allowed? Yes (S not at 1 is only constraint, so position 2 ok)
  Position 3: K -> allowed? Position 3: since we only know that it cannot be A or E? Then K (new) is ok.
  Position 4: E -> allowed? Because E cannot be at 3 or 5? Position 4 is allowed? Yes.
  Position 5: D.

Similarly, no forbidden letters.

But note: we know S is in the word? Yes? And we have S at position 2? Which is new? We only knew S was in the word from the '-' in steal at position 1? So we know S is somewhere else? And now we are testing S at position 2? That's okay? But we also might find out if S is at 2? Correctly?

But both ""BASED"" and ""ASKED"" are possible? But wait, we must consider the feedback? We know the secret word? Actually, no.

But we need to maximize information? Or just guess a word that fits.

The goal is to find the secret word.

But if we guess ""BASED"", it might be? But also we test B and D.

Similarly, ""ASKED"" tests K and D.

Which is better? B and K are both common, but we need to pick one.

Alternatively, we can try to use the letter P? Because P is common? Consider ""PHASE"", but H is new? And E at position 5? E cannot be at 5? So invalid.

Or ""SHADE"": 
  S, H, A, D, E.
  Positions:
    S at 1: but feedback from steal says S cannot be at 1? So invalid? Because in first position we have S? But the feedback for steal said S is in the word but not at position 1? Therefore, if we put S at 1 in a new word, that would be wrong? But we know it's wrong? So why try? So we cannot start with S? Therefore, ""SHADE"" has S at position 1, which is forbidden? Since we know S doesn't belong at position 1? So that word would be invalid? Not the secret word? So it's okay to avoid? We don't want to guess an invalid? Actually, we can guess words that we know are impossible? But why? Let me clarify: we can guess any 5-letter word? But if the secret word doesn't start with S? Why guess a word with S at 1 when we know it's wrong? We shouldn't? We must avoid positions that are impossible.

Therefore, we must avoid:
  Putting S at position 1 (from feedback in steal: S(-) meaning S is not at 1? Wait, the feedback only tells us that S is in the word but not at position 1? So for the secret word, S is at some position other than 1? Therefore, we cannot put S at 1.

So we must avoid S at 1, T at 2? But T is absent? We know T is absent? In the second guess, T was at position 2 and was marked x? So T is not in the word? So we don't use T.

Similarly, we must avoid the letters we know are absent.

Therefore, ""SHADE"" is invalid? Because S at 1 is disallowed? Our guess must have S not at position 1? Therefore, we cannot use words that have S at 1.

In fact, our guess must have S at position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Now, back to our candidate words:

Option 1: ""BASED""
  B at 1? B is new? Yes.
  A at 2? Allowed? Yes? We have no constraint against A at position 2? Only at 3 and 4.
  S at 3? Allowed? Yes? Because S was not at 1? Position 3 is okay.
  E at 4? Allowed? We know E is not at position 3? But 4 is okay? And not at position 5? So 4 is allowed.
  D at 5? New? And not forbidden.

Option 2: ""ASKED""
  A at 1? Allowed? Yes? (A can be at position 1? Because only constraints are not at 3 or 4)
  S at 2? Allowed? Yes? (S not at 1? Position 2 is fine)
  K at 3? Allowed? Because no constraints? And cannot be A or E? So a new letter is okay? Yes.
  E at 4? Allowed? Yes.
  D at 5.

Option 3: ""BAKES""? 
  B at 1? 
  A at 2?
  K at 3?
  E at 4?
  S at 5? Then S at position 5? Which is allowed? Because S not at 1? Position 5 is fine? And E at 4? Is that okay? No constraint? And A at 2? Okay? And we have A, E, S included.

But ""BAKES"" has E at position 4? Allowed? And S at position 5? Allowed.

But the word ""BAKES""? Valid.

Another candidate: ""WEARS""? But W? And E at position 2? And A at position 3? But A cannot be at position 3? So invalid.

Or ""SEAMS"": S at 1? Disallowed? Cannot.

Therefore, I have ""BASED"" and ""ASKED"", both seem valid.

Which to pick? Both test two new letters. We don't know if they will be present or not? So we'll get feedback.

To avoid missing, maybe pick one? I'll go with ""BASED"" because B is a common letter? But K is also common? Or perhaps they are equally common.

But note: from the first guess ""crane"", we had A at position 3? But the secret word had A? And from ""steal"", A at position 4? But both were wrong. So A must be in positions 1, 2, or 5? Similarly E must be in 1, 2, or 4.

In ""BASED"": A at position 2? That's one of the possibilities? It might reveal if A is at 2? Similarly, in ""ASKED"": A at position 1? Also possible.

But let me see if we can distinguish? Maybe not, so we choose arbitrarily.

Alternatively, we can consider letters that haven't been used: in ""BASED"", we use B and D? In ""ASKED"", K and D.

Maybe we can pick one? I'll pick ""BASED"".

Another word? How about ""PAVED""? P and V? Then E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? So invalid.

Or ""SHAPE"": S at 1? Disallowed.

Or ""OASIS"": O? And duplicate S? But we know S only one? Not necessarily? And E? We must include E? Oh, we forgot: the word must have E? ""OASIS"" does not have E? So invalid.

We must include A, E, S.

Another word: ""BEATS""? But T is absent? Cannot.

""GAMES""? M? Then S? But E must be? And A? 
  G, A, M, E, S -> 
    A at position 2? Allowed? 
    E at position 4? Allowed? 
    S at position 5? Allowed? 
    But does not contain T? T is absent? So no T? So valid? 
  But we know T is absent? That's fine? Letters G,M? 

Let's list more options? But we don't know? 

Also, note: in ""BASED"", we have E at position 4? Which we haven't tested before? Similarly, A at position 2? New.

Similarly for ""GAMES"": similar? E at 4? A at 2? 

But we don't need to use uncommon letters? We can pick BASED? Which is common.

Also, ""BASED"": uses B, A, S, E, D.

We haven't tried B, D before.

So I think ""BASED"" is a good choice? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""BASED"".

But let me confirm the positions:

""BASED"" is spelled B-A-S-E-D.

Position 1: B
Position 2: A
Position 3: S
Position 4: E
Position 5: D

Constraints:
- A at 2: not forbidden? Forbidden positions for A: 3 and 4? Position 2 is fine? Yes.
- E at 4: forbidden positions for E: 3 and 5? Position 4 is fine? Yes.
- S at 3: forbidden positions for S: only position 1? Position 3 is fine? Yes.

Nothing in position 1 or 5? No constraint.

And letters: absent letters: we avoid C,R,N,T,L? We used B,S,E,A,D? None forbidden? Except we know S,E,A are in? B and D are new? Valid.

So <guess>based</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- Confirmed letters in the secret word: **A**, **E**, **S** (as indicated by ""-"" in feedback, meaning they exist but were in the wrong positions).
- Absent letters: **C**, **R**, **N**, **T**, **L** (as indicated by ""x"").
- Position constraints:
  - A cannot be at position 3 (from ""crane"") or 4 (from ""steal"").
  - E cannot be at position 3 (from ""steal"") or 5 (from ""crane"").
  - S cannot be at position 1 (from ""steal"").

For this guess:
- Must include **A**, **E**, and **S** to probe new positions.
- Avoid using C, R, N, T, L.
- Consider new common letters (e.g., B, D, G, H, K) to test for presence.
- Ensure positions respect constraints:  
  - A can be at positions 1, 2, or 5.  
  - E can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.  
  - S can be at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Selected guess: **BASED**  
- **B** at position 1: New letter (tests for B).  
- **A** at position 2: Allowed (not position 3 or 4).  
- **S** at position 3: Allowed (not position 1).  
- **E** at position 4: Allowed (not position 3 or 5).  
- **D** at position 5: New letter (tests for D).  

This guess:
- Includes required letters (A, E, S).
- Avoids forbidden letters and positions.
- Tests B and D for presence/position.",Guess 3: based -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(-) S(-) E(✓) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,ASKEW,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. It covers common consonants and two vowels (A and E).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, A was in position 3 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word, A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Includes A and E (since they are in the word) but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
   - Does not include C, R, or N.

 Also, we want to test new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that:
   - Has A and E in new positions (not 3 for A and not 5 for E).
   - Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like S, T, L, I, O, etc.).

 We have 6 positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

 For the letter A: it cannot be in position 3. So it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 For the letter E: it cannot be in position 5. So it can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also want to avoid positions that might be fixed by the feedback? But we don't have any correct positions yet.

 Let's try to form a word that includes A and E and three new letters.

 Since we know A and E are in the word, we can try to place them in positions we haven't tested.

 Example possibilities for A: positions 1, 2, 4, 5. But note: if we put A in position 5, that's allowed because the feedback only said E cannot be in position 5, but A can be anywhere except 3.

 Similarly, E can be in positions 1,2,3,4.

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that has A and E and three new consonants or vowels.

 One idea: ""SLATE"" - but note that we have feedback that A is in the word but not in position 3, and E is in the word but not in position 5. In ""SLATE"":
   S in position 1
   L in position 2
   A in position 3 -> but wait, we cannot put A in position 3 because the feedback said A is not in position 3. So ""SLATE"" is invalid for A at position 3.

 We must avoid putting A at position 3.

 How about ""LEAST""? 
   L, E, A, S, T.
   Positions: 
     1: L
     2: E -> E is in position 2 (which is allowed because E can be in 1,2,3,4)
     3: A -> but A cannot be in position 3! So that's invalid.

 How about ""STALE""?
   S, T, A, L, E.
   Position 3: A -> again, A in position 3 is not allowed.

 We need to avoid position 3 for A.

 How about ""STEAL""?
   S, T, E, A, L.
   Position 1: S
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: E -> allowed for E (since E can be in 3)
   Position 4: A -> allowed for A (since A can be in 4)
   Position 5: L

 This word: 
   - Does not have C, R, or N (good).
   - Includes A and E, and A is not in position 3 (it's in 4) and E is not in position 5 (it's in 3) -> so that's okay.

 But note: we are also testing S, T, and L.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ADIEU"" but that has two vowels and we already know two vowels (A and E). Also, we have feedback that E is in the word, so we don't need to test more vowels necessarily? But we don't know if there are more.

 However, ""ADIEU"" has A and E and also I and U. But we are limited by the positions: 
   A in position 1: allowed.
   D in 2
   I in 3
   E in 4: allowed (since E can be in 4) 
   U in 5: but E cannot be in 5? That's okay because E is in 4, and U is new.

 But note: we don't know if the word has I or U. And we are avoiding C, R, N.

 However, we have only two known letters (A and E) and we want to test more common consonants.

 Another idea: ""PASTE""?
   P, A, S, T, E.
   Position 2: A -> allowed (since A can be in 2)
   Position 5: E -> but feedback said E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E in position 5.

 Therefore, ""PASTE"" is invalid because E is in position 5.

 How about ""PASTY""? That doesn't have E? But we know E is in the word, so we must include E.

 We must include both A and E.

 Let me try to list words that have A and E, and avoid positions 3 for A and 5 for E, and avoid C, R, N.

 Some options:

 Option 1: ""STEAL"" -> as above: S, T, E, A, L -> positions: E at 3 (allowed), A at 4 (allowed), and E not at 5 (good), A not at 3 (good).

 Option 2: ""SLATE"" is invalid because A is at 3.

 Option 3: ""LATTE"" -> but has double T? And A at position 2: allowed, E at position 5: not allowed.

 Option 4: ""TALES"" -> 
   T, A, L, E, S.
   A at position 2: allowed.
   E at position 4: allowed (since E can be in 4) -> but wait, the word ends with S? 
   However, we have to check: the feedback said E is not in position 5? In ""TALES"", E is in position 4 and S in 5 -> that's okay.

 But note: in ""TALES"", A is in position 2 (allowed) and E in position 4 (allowed). Also, no C, R, N.

 However, we have already tried the letter A and E, and we are testing T, L, S.

 But we also want to maximize new letters. Both ""STEAL"" and ""TALES"" use S, T, L, E, A.

 Another option: ""SAUTE"" -> 
   S, A, U, T, E.
   A in position 2: allowed.
   E in position 5: not allowed! So invalid.

 How about ""SALET""? (a type of helmet) -> 
   S, A, L, E, T.
   A in position 2: allowed.
   E in position 4: allowed.
   But note: we have A in position 2 and E in position 4. Also, we avoid position 3 for A and 5 for E? Actually, E is in 4 and the last letter is T, so E is not in 5 -> good.

 However, ""SALET"" is a valid word? It might be obscure.

 We should stick to common words.

 Another common word: ""LAPSE"" -> 
   L, A, P, S, E.
   A in position 2: allowed.
   E in position 5: not allowed -> invalid.

 How about ""LEAPS""? 
   L, E, A, P, S.
   E in position 2: allowed.
   A in position 3: not allowed! -> invalid.

 How about ""PLEAD""? 
   P, L, E, A, D.
   E in position 3: allowed.
   A in position 4: allowed.
   And no E in 5 -> good.

 But we haven't tested S or T, which are common.

 Considering the above, ""STEAL"" seems a good choice because:
   - It uses common letters S, T, L (which we haven't tried) and we already know A and E are in the word.
   - It places A and E in allowed positions: E in 3 (which is a new position for E) and A in 4 (new for A).

 Alternatively, ""TALES"" is also good.

 But note: we have feedback that A is in the word but not in position 3, and E is in the word but not in position 5. We don't know if they are in other positions. By placing them in new positions, we can get more information.

 Let me choose ""STEAL"".

 However, we must be cautious: what if the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

 So, I'll go with ""STEAL"".

 But wait: we have feedback that A is in the word and we are putting it in position 4. If the feedback comes back with A in the correct position, then we know. Similarly for E.

 Also, we are testing S, T, and L.

 If we get feedback that S, T, or L are in the word, that will help.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""STEAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (as indicated by ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (as indicated by ""-"").
- C, R, and N are not in the word (as indicated by ""x"").

For the next guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing A in position 3 and E in position 5.
- Exclude C, R, and N entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L) to gather more information.

The word ""steal"" fits these criteria:
- Places A in position 4 (avoiding position 3).
- Places E in position 3 (avoiding position 5).
- Includes new letters S, T, and L.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help identify positions for A and E while testing three new consonants.

<guess>steal</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We've had two guesses and their feedback:

First guess: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word but not at position 3
  N: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, wrong position) -> E in the word but not at position 5

Second guess: ""steal""
  S: - (in word, wrong position) -> S is in the word, but not at position 1
  T: x (not in word) -> T is not in the word
  E: - (in word, wrong position) -> E is in the word but not at position 3 (since in ""steal"", E is at position 3)
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> A is in the word but not at position 4 (since in ""steal"", A is at position 4)
  L: x (not in word) -> L is not in the word

Now we know:
- The word contains A, E, S (since they have '-' in the feedback).
- The word does not contain C, R, N, T, L (all marked 'x').
- Positions where letters cannot be:
  - A not at 3 (from crane) and not at 4 (from steal)
  - E not at 5 (from crane) and not at 3 (from steal)
  - S not at 1 (from steal)

Also, note that E and A must be in the word, so they appear somewhere else.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, E, A, L. So the absent letters are C, R, N, T, L.

The secret word must contain S, A, E, and two more letters that we haven't guessed yet (or we might have duplicates, but no indication so far).

We know the word has 5 distinct letters? Possibly, but duplicates are allowed. Since we have no duplicate feedback, let's assume no duplicates for now until we have evidence.

From the feedback, we have three confirmed letters: A, E, S. Therefore, we need two more letters.

We need to think of a word that:
- Contains A, E, S (since they are in the word) but avoids positions:
  - S not at 1
  - A not at 3 and 4
  - E not at 3 and 5
- Does not contain C, R, N, T, L (since they are absent)

We also want to test new common letters to identify the remaining letters.

Available common consonants: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Vowels: we already have A and E, so we don't necessarily need more vowels? But there might be another vowel.

We know the positions that are disallowed for the letters:

Position constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be S (from feedback of steal: S not at 1)
- Position 3: cannot be A or E (from crane: A not at 3; steal: E not at 3 -> so E not at 3 and A not at 3)
- Position 4: cannot be A (from steal: A not at 4)
- Position 5: cannot be E (from crane: E not at 5)

We don't have constraints on position 2 yet.

For E, it cannot be at 3 or 5. So E can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.
For A, it cannot be at 3 or 4. So A can be at positions 1, 2, or 5.
For S, it cannot be at 1. So S can be at 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We need to form a word with A, E, S, and two new letters.

Let's list possibilities:

Since E can be at 1, 2, 4; A at 1,2,5; S at 2,3,4,5.

But note: A and E cannot occupy the same position? So they must be in different positions.

We should try to place A, E, S in the remaining possible positions and then fill the other two letters with new ones.

One idea: place E in position 1. Then A can be in position 2 or 5. And S can be in 3,4, or 5 (if A not at 5) or in 2,3,4 if A at 5.

But we need a real word.

How about words starting with E? Then we have E at 1. Then for position 2, we can have A or another letter.

Example: ""E..."", and we know it must contain A and S.

Common words: ""EASTS"" has duplicates? Or ""EASEL"", but L is absent so invalid.

Words starting with E and having A and S, without C,R,N,T,L.

Possible: ""EASES"" but duplicates and also S is repeated. But we don't know if duplicates exist.

But let's think of words without duplicate letters to test new letters.

Another idea: since we don't know two letters, we can try a word that includes common remaining letters.

For example, include B or D or G or P.

Try placing S at position 2? Then position 1 can be something new.

But S cannot be at 1, position 1 must be a new letter.

Similarly, we have to avoid the forbidden positions.

Try a word with pattern:

Position 1: an available new letter (say B, D, G, ...) 
Position 2: could be A or E? Or S? 
Position 3: cannot be A or E, so must be a new letter or S? But position 3 can be S? Yes, because S can be at 3 (no constraint against S at 3).
Position 4: cannot be A, so new letter or E or S.
Position 5: cannot be E, so new letter or A or S.

But note we have to use exactly one of each of A, E, S? Unless duplicates.

We'll try to avoid duplicates for now.

Let me try to make a word with E in position 2? Then A must be in 1,2,5 but position 2 is taken by E so A at 1 or 5.

But position 1: if A can be at 1? Yes. Otherwise A at 5.

Similarly, S can be at 3,4,5 (if not taken).

Option: 
Position 1: A -> then word starts with A? But we have E at 2? Then positions: A, E, ?, ?, ?
Then we need an S and two new letters.

But E is at 2? That's allowed since E can be in 2? Yes. And A at 1 is allowed? Yes.

Then we have: A, E, ....? 

The word: A, E, ... and we need S and two more.

Words: AEGIS? But G and I. Or AEONS? But we know N is absent. Or AEGIS? But I is a vowel.

But note we haven't banned I, U, O.

We can use vowels.

A better approach: we know the forbidden letters: C, R, N, T, L. So we can use any other letter.

List of possible words containing A, E, S.

Since we don't know the positions, but we have constraints.

Try ""BASED"": 
  B, A, S, E, D.
  Check positions:
    Position 1: B (new, allowed)
    Position 2: A -> but A cannot be at position 2? Wait we have no constraints on position 2 for A? Actually, from feedback, A cannot be at position 3 or 4. Position 2 is allowed? Yes. So A at 2 is okay?
    Position 3: S? But we have constraint: position 3 cannot be A or E. S is allowed? Yes.
    Position 4: E? But E cannot be at position 3? Position 4 for E: possible? Yes, because we only have constraints for E at 3 and 5? So E at 4 is fine? 
    Position 5: D (new)

Now check against the constraints:
- S is in the word: yes, at position 3 -> S can be at 3? (we only know S not at 1, but 3 is okay).
- A at 2: allowed (since not forbidden)
- E at 4: allowed (not 3 or 5).
Also, doesn't contain forbidden letters: no C,R,N,T,L.

But note: we need to confirm positions: 
  A at position 2: is that allowed? From previous, the constraints on A are: not at position 3 (from crane) and not at position 4 (from steal). Position 2 is new and allowed? Yes.
  E? In crane we knew E was not at 5, and from steal we knew E was not at 3. Position 4 is new? Yes, allowed.

So ""BASED"" seems good.

Another option: ""ASKED"", but K is new? But position constraints? 
  Position 1: A -> allowed? Yes (A can be at 1)
  Position 2: S -> allowed? But we don't have constraint on position 2. Also S can be at 2? Because S only forbidden at 1? So it's okay? Then 
  A at position 1: that's fine (no constraint against position 1 for A? Only against 3 and 4)
  S at position 2: ok
  K at position 3: since position 3 can have S? Or a new letter? But we must note that position 3 cannot be A or E? So K is fine? And E?

But wait: we must include E! In ""ASKED"", we have A,S,K,E,D -> E in position 4? Then D at 5.

Check E: position 4 is allowed? Yes because E can be at 4? And A at 1? Also no forbidden letters.

But we have constraint from steal: E not at 3? But here E is at 4? Good.

But let me compare with the constraints:

For ""ASKED"":
  Position 1: A -> allowed? Yes (A not forbidden at 1)
  Position 2: S -> allowed? Yes (S not at 1 is only constraint, so position 2 ok)
  Position 3: K -> allowed? Position 3: since we only know that it cannot be A or E? Then K (new) is ok.
  Position 4: E -> allowed? Because E cannot be at 3 or 5? Position 4 is allowed? Yes.
  Position 5: D.

Similarly, no forbidden letters.

But note: we know S is in the word? Yes? And we have S at position 2? Which is new? We only knew S was in the word from the '-' in steal at position 1? So we know S is somewhere else? And now we are testing S at position 2? That's okay? But we also might find out if S is at 2? Correctly?

But both ""BASED"" and ""ASKED"" are possible? But wait, we must consider the feedback? We know the secret word? Actually, no.

But we need to maximize information? Or just guess a word that fits.

The goal is to find the secret word.

But if we guess ""BASED"", it might be? But also we test B and D.

Similarly, ""ASKED"" tests K and D.

Which is better? B and K are both common, but we need to pick one.

Alternatively, we can try to use the letter P? Because P is common? Consider ""PHASE"", but H is new? And E at position 5? E cannot be at 5? So invalid.

Or ""SHADE"": 
  S, H, A, D, E.
  Positions:
    S at 1: but feedback from steal says S cannot be at 1? So invalid? Because in first position we have S? But the feedback for steal said S is in the word but not at position 1? Therefore, if we put S at 1 in a new word, that would be wrong? But we know it's wrong? So why try? So we cannot start with S? Therefore, ""SHADE"" has S at position 1, which is forbidden? Since we know S doesn't belong at position 1? So that word would be invalid? Not the secret word? So it's okay to avoid? We don't want to guess an invalid? Actually, we can guess words that we know are impossible? But why? Let me clarify: we can guess any 5-letter word? But if the secret word doesn't start with S? Why guess a word with S at 1 when we know it's wrong? We shouldn't? We must avoid positions that are impossible.

Therefore, we must avoid:
  Putting S at position 1 (from feedback in steal: S(-) meaning S is not at 1? Wait, the feedback only tells us that S is in the word but not at position 1? So for the secret word, S is at some position other than 1? Therefore, we cannot put S at 1.

So we must avoid S at 1, T at 2? But T is absent? We know T is absent? In the second guess, T was at position 2 and was marked x? So T is not in the word? So we don't use T.

Similarly, we must avoid the letters we know are absent.

Therefore, ""SHADE"" is invalid? Because S at 1 is disallowed? Our guess must have S not at position 1? Therefore, we cannot use words that have S at 1.

In fact, our guess must have S at position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Now, back to our candidate words:

Option 1: ""BASED""
  B at 1? B is new? Yes.
  A at 2? Allowed? Yes? We have no constraint against A at position 2? Only at 3 and 4.
  S at 3? Allowed? Yes? Because S was not at 1? Position 3 is okay.
  E at 4? Allowed? We know E is not at position 3? But 4 is okay? And not at position 5? So 4 is allowed.
  D at 5? New? And not forbidden.

Option 2: ""ASKED""
  A at 1? Allowed? Yes? (A can be at position 1? Because only constraints are not at 3 or 4)
  S at 2? Allowed? Yes? (S not at 1? Position 2 is fine)
  K at 3? Allowed? Because no constraints? And cannot be A or E? So a new letter is okay? Yes.
  E at 4? Allowed? Yes.
  D at 5.

Option 3: ""BAKES""? 
  B at 1? 
  A at 2?
  K at 3?
  E at 4?
  S at 5? Then S at position 5? Which is allowed? Because S not at 1? Position 5 is fine? And E at 4? Is that okay? No constraint? And A at 2? Okay? And we have A, E, S included.

But ""BAKES"" has E at position 4? Allowed? And S at position 5? Allowed.

But the word ""BAKES""? Valid.

Another candidate: ""WEARS""? But W? And E at position 2? And A at position 3? But A cannot be at position 3? So invalid.

Or ""SEAMS"": S at 1? Disallowed? Cannot.

Therefore, I have ""BASED"" and ""ASKED"", both seem valid.

Which to pick? Both test two new letters. We don't know if they will be present or not? So we'll get feedback.

To avoid missing, maybe pick one? I'll go with ""BASED"" because B is a common letter? But K is also common? Or perhaps they are equally common.

But note: from the first guess ""crane"", we had A at position 3? But the secret word had A? And from ""steal"", A at position 4? But both were wrong. So A must be in positions 1, 2, or 5? Similarly E must be in 1, 2, or 4.

In ""BASED"": A at position 2? That's one of the possibilities? It might reveal if A is at 2? Similarly, in ""ASKED"": A at position 1? Also possible.

But let me see if we can distinguish? Maybe not, so we choose arbitrarily.

Alternatively, we can consider letters that haven't been used: in ""BASED"", we use B and D? In ""ASKED"", K and D.

Maybe we can pick one? I'll pick ""BASED"".

Another word? How about ""PAVED""? P and V? Then E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? So invalid.

Or ""SHAPE"": S at 1? Disallowed.

Or ""OASIS"": O? And duplicate S? But we know S only one? Not necessarily? And E? We must include E? Oh, we forgot: the word must have E? ""OASIS"" does not have E? So invalid.

We must include A, E, S.

Another word: ""BEATS""? But T is absent? Cannot.

""GAMES""? M? Then S? But E must be? And A? 
  G, A, M, E, S -> 
    A at position 2? Allowed? 
    E at position 4? Allowed? 
    S at position 5? Allowed? 
    But does not contain T? T is absent? So no T? So valid? 
  But we know T is absent? That's fine? Letters G,M? 

Let's list more options? But we don't know? 

Also, note: in ""BASED"", we have E at position 4? Which we haven't tested before? Similarly, A at position 2? New.

Similarly for ""GAMES"": similar? E at 4? A at 2? 

But we don't need to use uncommon letters? We can pick BASED? Which is common.

Also, ""BASED"": uses B, A, S, E, D.

We haven't tried B, D before.

So I think ""BASED"" is a good choice? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""BASED"".

But let me confirm the positions:

""BASED"" is spelled B-A-S-E-D.

Position 1: B
Position 2: A
Position 3: S
Position 4: E
Position 5: D

Constraints:
- A at 2: not forbidden? Forbidden positions for A: 3 and 4? Position 2 is fine? Yes.
- E at 4: forbidden positions for E: 3 and 5? Position 4 is fine? Yes.
- S at 3: forbidden positions for S: only position 1? Position 3 is fine? Yes.

Nothing in position 1 or 5? No constraint.

And letters: absent letters: we avoid C,R,N,T,L? We used B,S,E,A,D? None forbidden? Except we know S,E,A are in? B and D are new? Valid.

So <guess>based</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- Confirmed letters in the secret word: **A**, **E**, **S** (as indicated by ""-"" in feedback, meaning they exist but were in the wrong positions).
- Absent letters: **C**, **R**, **N**, **T**, **L** (as indicated by ""x"").
- Position constraints:
  - A cannot be at position 3 (from ""crane"") or 4 (from ""steal"").
  - E cannot be at position 3 (from ""steal"") or 5 (from ""crane"").
  - S cannot be at position 1 (from ""steal"").

For this guess:
- Must include **A**, **E**, and **S** to probe new positions.
- Avoid using C, R, N, T, L.
- Consider new common letters (e.g., B, D, G, H, K) to test for presence.
- Ensure positions respect constraints:  
  - A can be at positions 1, 2, or 5.  
  - E can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.  
  - S can be at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Selected guess: **BASED**  
- **B** at position 1: New letter (tests for B).  
- **A** at position 2: Allowed (not position 3 or 4).  
- **S** at position 3: Allowed (not position 1).  
- **E** at position 4: Allowed (not position 3 or 5).  
- **D** at position 5: New letter (tests for D).  

This guess:
- Includes required letters (A, E, S).
- Avoids forbidden letters and positions.
- Tests B and D for presence/position.

But we don\'t have any correct positions yet.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that includes A and E and three new letters.\n\n Since we know A and E are in the word, we can try to place them in positions we haven\'t tested.\n\n Example possibilities for A: positions 1, 2, 4, 5. But note: if we put A in position 5, that\'s allowed because the feedback only said E cannot be in position 5, but A can be anywhere except 3.\n\n Similarly, E can be in positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n We also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has A and E and three new consonants or vowels.\n\n One idea: ""SLATE"" - but note that we have feedback that A is in the word but not in position 3, and E is in the word but not in position 5. In ""SLATE"":\n   S in position 1\n   L in position 2\n   A in position 3 -> but wait, we cannot put A in position 3 because the feedback said A is not in position 3. So ""SLATE"" is invalid for A at position 3.\n\n We must avoid putting A at position 3.\n\n How about ""LEAST""? \n   L, E, A, S, T.\n   Positions: \n     1: L\n     2: E -> E is in position 2 (which is allowed because E can be in 1,2,3,4)\n     3: A -> but A cannot be in position 3! So that\'s invalid.\n\n How about ""STALE""?\n   S, T, A, L, E.\n   Position 3: A -> again, A in position 3 is not allowed.\n\n We need to avoid position 3 for A.\n\n How about ""STEAL""?\n   S, T, E, A, L.\n   Position 1: S\n   Position 2: T\n   Position 3: E -> allowed for E (since E can be in 3)\n   Position 4: A -> allowed for A (since A can be in 4)\n   Position 5: L\n\n This word: \n   - Does not have C, R, or N (good).\n   - Includes A and E, and A is not in position 3 (it\'s in 4) and E is not in position 5 (it\'s in 3) -> so that\'s okay.\n\n But note: we are also testing S, T, and L.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""ADIEU"" but that has two vowels and we already know two vowels (A and E). Also, we have feedback that E is in the word, so we don\'t need to test more vowels necessarily? But we don\'t know if there are more.\n\n However, ""ADIEU"" has A and E and also I and U. But we are limited by the positions: \n   A in position 1: allowed.\n   D in 2\n   I in 3\n   E in 4: allowed (since E can be in 4) \n   U in 5: but E cannot be in 5? That\'s okay because E is in 4, and U is new.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has I or U. And we are avoiding C, R, N.\n\n However, we have only two known letters (A and E) and we want to test more common consonants.\n\n Another idea: ""PASTE""?\n   P, A, S, T, E.\n   Position 2: A -> allowed (since A can be in 2)\n   Position 5: E -> but feedback said E is not in position 5? So we cannot put E in position 5.\n\n Therefore, ""PASTE"" is invalid because E is in position 5.\n\n How about ""PASTY""? That doesn\'t have E? But we know E is in the word, so we must include E.\n\n We must include both A and E.\n\n Let me try to list words that have A and E, and avoid positions 3 for A and 5 for E, and avoid C, R, N.\n\n Some options:\n\n Option 1: ""STEAL"" -> as above: S, T, E, A, L -> positions: E at 3 (allowed), A at 4 (allowed), and E not at 5 (good), A not at 3 (good).\n\n Option 2: ""SLATE"" is invalid because A is at 3.\n\n Option 3: ""LATTE"" -> but has double T? And A at position 2: allowed, E at position 5: not allowed.\n\n Option 4: ""TALES"" -> \n   T, A, L, E, S.\n   A at position 2: allowed.\n   E at position 4: allowed (since E can be in 4) -> but wait, the word ends with S? \n   However, we have to check: the feedback said E is not in position 5? In ""TALES"", E is in position 4 and S in 5 -> that\'s okay.\n\n But note: in ""TALES"", A is in position 2 (allowed) and E in position 4 (allowed). Also, no C, R, N.\n\n However, we have already tried the letter A and E, and we are testing T, L, S.\n\n But we also want to maximize new letters. Both ""STEAL"" and ""TALES"" use S, T, L, E, A.\n\n Another option: ""SAUTE"" -> \n   S, A, U, T, E.\n   A in position 2: allowed.\n   E in position 5: not allowed! So invalid.\n\n How about ""SALET""? (a type of helmet) -> \n   S, A, L, E, T.\n   A in position 2: allowed.\n   E in position 4: allowed.\n   But note: we have A in position 2 and E in position 4. Also, we avoid position 3 for A and 5 for E? Actually, E is in 4 and the last letter is T, so E is not in 5 -> good.\n\n However, ""SALET"" is a valid word? It might be obscure.\n\n We should stick to common words.\n\n Another common word: ""LAPSE"" -> \n   L, A, P, S, E.\n   A in position 2: allowed.\n   E in position 5: not allowed -> invalid.\n\n How about ""LEAPS""? \n   L, E, A, P, S.\n   E in position 2: allowed.\n   A in position 3: not allowed! -> invalid.\n\n How about ""PLEAD""? \n   P, L, E, A, D.\n   E in position 3: allowed.\n   A in position 4: allowed.\n   And no E in 5 -> good.\n\n But we haven\'t tested S or T, which are common.\n\n Considering the above, ""STEAL"" seems a good choice because:\n   - It uses common letters S, T, L (which we haven\'t tried) and we already know A and E are in the word.\n   - It places A and E in allowed positions: E in 3 (which is a new position for E) and A in 4 (new for A).\n\n Alternatively, ""TALES"" is also good.\n\n But note: we have feedback that A is in the word but not in position 3, and E is in the word but not in position 5. We don\'t know if they are in other positions. By placing them in new positions, we can get more information.\n\n Let me choose ""STEAL"".\n\n However, we must be cautious: what if the word has duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates yet.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""STEAL"".\n\n But wait: we have feedback that A is in the word and we are putting it in position 4. If the feedback comes back with A in the correct position, then we know. Similarly for E.\n\n Also, we are testing S, T, and L.\n\n If we get feedback that S, T, or L are in the word, that will help.\n\n Therefore, my next guess is ""STEAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (as indicated by ""-"").\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (as indicated by ""-"").\n- C, R, and N are not in the word (as indicated by ""x"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing A in position 3 and E in position 5.\n- Exclude C, R, and N entirely.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L) to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""steal"" fits these criteria:\n- Places A in position 4 (avoiding position 3).\n- Places E in position 3 (avoiding position 5).\n- Includes new letters S, T, and L.\n- Is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nThis guess will help identify positions for A and E while testing three new consonants.\n\n<guess>steal</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We\'ve had two guesses and their feedback:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: x (not in word)\n  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word but not at position 3\n  N: x (not in word)\n  E: - (in word, wrong position) -> E in the word but not at position 5\n\nSecond guess: ""steal""\n  S: - (in word, wrong position) -> S is in the word, but not at position 1\n  T: x (not in word) -> T is not in the word\n  E: - (in word, wrong position) -> E is in the word but not at position 3 (since in ""steal"", E is at position 3)\n  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> A is in the word but not at position 4 (since in ""steal"", A is at position 4)\n  L: x (not in word) -> L is not in the word\n\nNow we know:\n- The word contains A, E, S (since they have \'-\' in the feedback).\n- The word does not contain C, R, N, T, L (all marked \'x\').\n- Positions where letters cannot be:\n  - A not at 3 (from crane) and not at 4 (from steal)\n  - E not at 5 (from crane) and not at 3 (from steal)\n  - S not at 1 (from steal)\n\nAlso, note that E and A must be in the word, so they appear somewhere else.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, E, A, L. So the absent letters are C, R, N, T, L.\n\nThe secret word must contain S, A, E, and two more letters that we haven\'t guessed yet (or we might have duplicates, but no indication so far).\n\nWe know the word has 5 distinct letters? Possibly, but duplicates are allowed. Since we have no duplicate feedback, let\'s assume no duplicates for now until we have evidence.\n\nFrom the feedback, we have three confirmed letters: A, E, S. Therefore, we need two more letters.\n\nWe need to think of a word that:\n- Contains A, E, S (since they are in the word) but avoids positions:\n  - S not at 1\n  - A not at 3 and 4\n  - E not at 3 and 5\n- Does not contain C, R, N, T, L (since they are absent)\n\nWe also want to test new common letters to identify the remaining letters.\n\nAvailable common consonants: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nVowels: we already have A and E, so we don\'t necessarily need more vowels? But there might be another vowel.\n\nWe know the positions that are disallowed for the letters:\n\nPosition constraints:\n- Position 1: cannot be S (from feedback of steal: S not at 1)\n- Position 3: cannot be A or E (from crane: A not at 3; steal: E not at 3 -> so E not at 3 and A not at 3)\n- Position 4: cannot be A (from steal: A not at 4)\n- Position 5: cannot be E (from crane: E not at 5)\n\nWe don\'t have constraints on position 2 yet.\n\nFor E, it cannot be at 3 or 5. So E can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.\nFor A, it cannot be at 3 or 4. So A can be at positions 1, 2, or 5.\nFor S, it cannot be at 1. So S can be at 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nWe need to form a word with A, E, S, and two new letters.\n\nLet\'s list possibilities:\n\nSince E can be at 1, 2, 4; A at 1,2,5; S at 2,3,4,5.\n\nBut note: A and E cannot occupy the same position? So they must be in different positions.\n\nWe should try to place A, E, S in the remaining possible positions and then fill the other two letters with new ones.\n\nOne idea: place E in position 1. Then A can be in position 2 or 5. And S can be in 3,4, or 5 (if A not at 5) or in 2,3,4 if A at 5.\n\nBut we need a real word.\n\nHow about words starting with E? Then we have E at 1. Then for position 2, we can have A or another letter.\n\nExample: ""E..."", and we know it must contain A and S.\n\nCommon words: ""EASTS"" has duplicates? Or ""EASEL"", but L is absent so invalid.\n\nWords starting with E and having A and S, without C,R,N,T,L.\n\nPossible: ""EASES"" but duplicates and also S is repeated. But we don\'t know if duplicates exist.\n\nBut let\'s think of words without duplicate letters to test new letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we don\'t know two letters, we can try a word that includes common remaining letters.\n\nFor example, include B or D or G or P.\n\nTry placing S at position 2? Then position 1 can be something new.\n\nBut S cannot be at 1, position 1 must be a new letter.\n\nSimilarly, we have to avoid the forbidden positions.\n\nTry a word with pattern:\n\nPosition 1: an available new letter (say B, D, G, ...) \nPosition 2: could be A or E? Or S? \nPosition 3: cannot be A or E, so must be a new letter or S? But position 3 can be S? Yes, because S can be at 3 (no constraint against S at 3).\nPosition 4: cannot be A, so new letter or E or S.\nPosition 5: cannot be E, so new letter or A or S.\n\nBut note we have to use exactly one of each of A, E, S? Unless duplicates.\n\nWe\'ll try to avoid duplicates for now.\n\nLet me try to make a word with E in position 2? Then A must be in 1,2,5 but position 2 is taken by E so A at 1 or 5.\n\nBut position 1: if A can be at 1? Yes. Otherwise A at 5.\n\nSimilarly, S can be at 3,4,5 (if not taken).\n\nOption: \nPosition 1: A -> then word starts with A? But we have E at 2? Then positions: A, E, ?, ?, ?\nThen we need an S and two new letters.\n\nBut E is at 2? That\'s allowed since E can be in 2? Yes. And A at 1 is allowed? Yes.\n\nThen we have: A, E, ....? \n\nThe word: A, E, ... and we need S and two more.\n\nWords: AEGIS? But G and I. Or AEONS? But we know N is absent. Or AEGIS? But I is a vowel.\n\nBut note we haven\'t banned I, U, O.\n\nWe can use vowels.\n\nA better approach: we know the forbidden letters: C, R, N, T, L. So we can use any other letter.\n\nList of possible words containing A, E, S.\n\nSince we don\'t know the positions, but we have constraints.\n\nTry ""BASED"": \n  B, A, S, E, D.\n  Check positions:\n    Position 1: B (new, allowed)\n    Position 2: A -> but A cannot be at position 2? Wait we have no constraints on position 2 for A? Actually, from feedback, A cannot be at position 3 or 4. Position 2 is allowed? Yes. So A at 2 is okay?\n    Position 3: S? But we have constraint: position 3 cannot be A or E. S is allowed? Yes.\n    Position 4: E? But E cannot be at position 3? Position 4 for E: possible? Yes, because we only have constraints for E at 3 and 5? So E at 4 is fine? \n    Position 5: D (new)\n\nNow check against the constraints:\n- S is in the word: yes, at position 3 -> S can be at 3? (we only know S not at 1, but 3 is okay).\n- A at 2: allowed (since not forbidden)\n- E at 4: allowed (not 3 or 5).\nAlso, doesn\'t contain forbidden letters: no C,R,N,T,L.\n\nBut note: we need to confirm positions: \n  A at position 2: is that allowed? From previous, the constraints on A are: not at position 3 (from crane) and not at position 4 (from steal). Position 2 is new and allowed? Yes.\n  E? In crane we knew E was not at 5, and from steal we knew E was not at 3. Position 4 is new? Yes, allowed.\n\nSo ""BASED"" seems good.\n\nAnother option: ""ASKED"", but K is new? But position constraints? \n  Position 1: A -> allowed? Yes (A can be at 1)\n  Position 2: S -> allowed? But we don\'t have constraint on position 2. Also S can be at 2? Because S only forbidden at 1? So it\'s okay? Then \n  A at position 1: that\'s fine (no constraint against position 1 for A? Only against 3 and 4)\n  S at position 2: ok\n  K at position 3: since position 3 can have S? Or a new letter? But we must note that position 3 cannot be A or E? So K is fine? And E?\n\nBut wait: we must include E! In ""ASKED"", we have A,S,K,E,D -> E in position 4? Then D at 5.\n\nCheck E: position 4 is allowed? Yes because E can be at 4? And A at 1? Also no forbidden letters.\n\nBut we have constraint from steal: E not at 3? But here E is at 4? Good.\n\nBut let me compare with the constraints:\n\nFor ""ASKED"":\n  Position 1: A -> allowed? Yes (A not forbidden at 1)\n  Position 2: S -> allowed? Yes (S not at 1 is only constraint, so position 2 ok)\n  Position 3: K -> allowed? Position 3: since we only know that it cannot be A or E? Then K (new) is ok.\n  Position 4: E -> allowed? Because E cannot be at 3 or 5? Position 4 is allowed? Yes.\n  Position 5: D.\n\nSimilarly, no forbidden letters.\n\nBut note: we know S is in the word? Yes? And we have S at position 2? Which is new? We only knew S was in the word from the \'-\' in steal at position 1? So we know S is somewhere else? And now we are testing S at position 2? That\'s okay? But we also might find out if S is at 2? Correctly?\n\nBut both ""BASED"" and ""ASKED"" are possible? But wait, we must consider the feedback? We know the secret word? Actually, no.\n\nBut we need to maximize information? Or just guess a word that fits.\n\nThe goal is to find the secret word.\n\nBut if we guess ""BASED"", it might be? But also we test B and D.\n\nSimilarly, ""ASKED"" tests K and D.\n\nWhich is better? B and K are both common, but we need to pick one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use the letter P? Because P is common? Consider ""PHASE"", but H is new? And E at position 5? E cannot be at 5? So invalid.\n\nOr ""SHADE"": \n  S, H, A, D, E.\n  Positions:\n    S at 1: but feedback from steal says S cannot be at 1? So invalid? Because in first position we have S? But the feedback for steal said S is in the word but not at position 1? Therefore, if we put S at 1 in a new word, that would be wrong? But we know it\'s wrong? So why try? So we cannot start with S? Therefore, ""SHADE"" has S at position 1, which is forbidden? Since we know S doesn\'t belong at position 1? So that word would be invalid? Not the secret word? So it\'s okay to avoid? We don\'t want to guess an invalid? Actually, we can guess words that we know are impossible? But why? Let me clarify: we can guess any 5-letter word? But if the secret word doesn\'t start with S? Why guess a word with S at 1 when we know it\'s wrong? We shouldn\'t? We must avoid positions that are impossible.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid:\n  Putting S at position 1 (from feedback in steal: S(-) meaning S is not at 1? Wait, the feedback only tells us that S is in the word but not at position 1? So for the secret word, S is at some position other than 1? Therefore, we cannot put S at 1.\n\nSo we must avoid S at 1, T at 2? But T is absent? We know T is absent? In the second guess, T was at position 2 and was marked x? So T is not in the word? So we don\'t use T.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid the letters we know are absent.\n\nTherefore, ""SHADE"" is invalid? Because S at 1 is disallowed? Our guess must have S not at position 1? Therefore, we cannot use words that have S at 1.\n\nIn fact, our guess must have S at position 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nNow, back to our candidate words:\n\nOption 1: ""BASED""\n  B at 1? B is new? Yes.\n  A at 2? Allowed? Yes? We have no constraint against A at position 2? Only at 3 and 4.\n  S at 3? Allowed? Yes? Because S was not at 1? Position 3 is okay.\n  E at 4? Allowed? We know E is not at position 3? But 4 is okay? And not at position 5? So 4 is allowed.\n  D at 5? New? And not forbidden.\n\nOption 2: ""ASKED""\n  A at 1? Allowed? Yes? (A can be at position 1? Because only constraints are not at 3 or 4)\n  S at 2? Allowed? Yes? (S not at 1? Position 2 is fine)\n  K at 3? Allowed? Because no constraints? And cannot be A or E? So a new letter is okay? Yes.\n  E at 4? Allowed? Yes.\n  D at 5.\n\nOption 3: ""BAKES""? \n  B at 1? \n  A at 2?\n  K at 3?\n  E at 4?\n  S at 5? Then S at position 5? Which is allowed? Because S not at 1? Position 5 is fine? And E at 4? Is that okay? No constraint? And A at 2? Okay? And we have A, E, S included.\n\nBut ""BAKES"" has E at position 4? Allowed? And S at position 5? Allowed.\n\nBut the word ""BAKES""? Valid.\n\nAnother candidate: ""WEARS""? But W? And E at position 2? And A at position 3? But A cannot be at position 3? So invalid.\n\nOr ""SEAMS"": S at 1? Disallowed? Cannot.\n\nTherefore, I have ""BASED"" and ""ASKED"", both seem valid.\n\nWhich to pick? Both test two new letters. We don\'t know if they will be present or not? So we\'ll get feedback.\n\nTo avoid missing, maybe pick one? I\'ll go with ""BASED"" because B is a common letter? But K is also common? Or perhaps they are equally common.\n\nBut note: from the first guess ""crane"", we had A at position 3? But the secret word had A? And from ""steal"", A at position 4? But both were wrong. So A must be in positions 1, 2, or 5? Similarly E must be in 1, 2, or 4.\n\nIn ""BASED"": A at position 2? That\'s one of the possibilities? It might reveal if A is at 2? Similarly, in ""ASKED"": A at position 1? Also possible.\n\nBut let me see if we can distinguish? Maybe not, so we choose arbitrarily.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider letters that haven\'t been used: in ""BASED"", we use B and D? In ""ASKED"", K and D.\n\nMaybe we can pick one? I\'ll pick ""BASED"".\n\nAnother word? How about ""PAVED""? P and V? Then E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? So invalid.\n\nOr ""SHAPE"": S at 1? Disallowed.\n\nOr ""OASIS"": O? And duplicate S? But we know S only one? Not necessarily? And E? We must include E? Oh, we forgot: the word must have E? ""OASIS"" does not have E? So invalid.\n\nWe must include A, E, S.\n\nAnother word: ""BEATS""? But T is absent? Cannot.\n\n""GAMES""? M? Then S? But E must be? And A? \n  G, A, M, E, S -> \n    A at position 2? Allowed? \n    E at position 4? Allowed? \n    S at position 5? Allowed? \n    But does not contain T? T is absent? So no T? So valid? \n  But we know T is absent? That\'s fine? Letters G,M? \n\nLet\'s list more options? But we don\'t know? \n\nAlso, note: in ""BASED"", we have E at position 4? Which we haven\'t tested before? Similarly, A at position 2? New.\n\nSimilarly for ""GAMES"": similar? E at 4? A at 2? \n\nBut we don\'t need to use uncommon letters? We can pick BASED? Which is common.\n\nAlso, ""BASED"": uses B, A, S, E, D.\n\nWe haven\'t tried B, D before.\n\nSo I think ""BASED"" is a good choice? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""BASED"".\n\nBut let me confirm the positions:\n\n""BASED"" is spelled B-A-S-E-D.\n\nPosition 1: B\nPosition 2: A\nPosition 3: S\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: D\n\nConstraints:\n- A at 2: not forbidden?

Position 3 is fine? Yes.\n\nNothing in position 1 or 5? No constraint.\n\nAnd letters: absent letters: we avoid C,R,N,T,L? We used B,S,E,A,D? None forbidden? Except we know S,E,A are in?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (absent)
  R: x (absent)
  A: - (present, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
  N: x (absent)
  E: - (present, wrong position) -> E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""steal""
  S: - (present, wrong position) -> S is in the word, but not at position 1
  T: x (absent)
  E: - (present, wrong position) -> E is in the word, but not at position 3
  A: - (present, wrong position) -> A is in the word, but not at position 4
  L: x (absent)

Guess 3: ""based""
  B: x (absent)
  A: - (present, wrong position) -> A is in the word, but not at position 2 (since in ""based"", A was at position 2)
  S: - (present, wrong position) -> S is in the word, but not at position 3 (since in ""based"", S was at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct position) -> E is in the word and at position 4
  D: x (absent)

Now, we know:

1. The secret word has E at position 4 (from the correct feedback in guess 3).
2. The secret word contains A and S, but:
   - A is not at position 2, 3, or 4 (from guesses 1, 2, and 3: not at 3 from crane, not at 4 from steal, not at 2 from based).
   - S is not at position 1 (from steal) and not at position 3 (from based).

3. Absent letters: C, R, N, T, L, B, D.

4. We have E fixed at position 4: so the word is _ _ _ E _

5. A must be in the word, but cannot be at positions 2, 3, or 4. The only positions left are 1 and 5.

   Similarly, S must be in the word, but cannot be at positions 1 or 3. The positions left for S are 2, 4, and 5. But position 4 is taken by E, so S can only be at position 2 or 5.

6. Therefore, the word has:
   - Position 4: E (fixed)
   - A must be at position 1 or 5.
   - S must be at position 2 or 5.

   But note: if S is at position 5, then A cannot be at 5? So they cannot both be at 5. Therefore, we have two cases:

   Case 1: A at position 1 and S at position 2.
      Word: A S ? E ?

   Case 2: A at position 1 and S at position 5.
      Word: A ? ? E S

   Case 3: A at position 5 and S at position 2.
      Word: ? S ? E A

   But note: we have three positions to fill? Actually, we have positions 1,2,3,5 to fill? But position 4 is fixed as E.

   And we have two known letters (A and S) to place, and one more unknown letter? Because the word has 5 letters: we have E at 4, and we need to place A and S, and one more letter? Actually, we have three positions: 1,2,3,5? But we have two letters to place? No: we have to place A and S and one more letter? Because the word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 is fixed. So we have positions 1,2,3,5 to fill? But we have two letters (A and S) that must be placed? Then we need two more letters? Or one? Actually, we have to place A and S in two of the positions 1,2,3,5? And the remaining two positions? We need two more letters? But we don't know? 

   Actually, the word must contain exactly the letters: A, S, E, and two other letters? Or possibly duplicates? But we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume no duplicates? Then we have three positions to fill? Because position 4 is fixed? And we have to place A and S? So that leaves one position (either 1,2,3,5 minus the two positions taken by A and S) and one more letter? 

   Actually, we have four positions: 1,2,3,5. We have to assign A and S to two of them? And the other two positions? We need two more letters? But we have only one more position? Because 4 is fixed? So positions 1,2,3,5: that's four positions? We have to fill four positions? But we have two known letters (A and S) to place? And two more letters? 

   Therefore, the word has: 
     - E at position 4
     - A at one of {1,5}
     - S at one of {2,5} (but if A is at 5, then S cannot be at 5? So if A at 5, then S must be at 2? Similarly, if A at 1, then S can be at 2 or 5? But if S at 5, then position 2 is open? 

   And we have two more positions to fill? For example:

   Case 1: A at 1, S at 2 -> then positions 3 and 5 are open: word: A S ? E ?
   Case 2: A at 1, S at 5 -> then positions 2 and 3 are open: word: A ? ? E S
   Case 3: A at 5, S at 2 -> then positions 1 and 3 are open: word: ? S ? E A

   And we have to choose two more letters? But we have many absent letters? We know the absent letters: C, R, N, T, L, B, D. So we cannot use these.

   We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, E, A, L, B, D? But the secret word has A, S, E, and two more? The two more must be from the remaining alphabet? Excluding absent ones.

   Available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   We need to form a word that fits one of the patterns and uses two letters from the available set.

   Also, we have feedback that in ""based"", A was at position 2 and was wrong? So A is not at 2? Similarly, S was at position 3 and was wrong? So S not at 3? And we already know E is at 4? Correct.

   Now, we need to guess a word that tests the possibilities? But we have three cases? We can try to cover multiple cases? Or we can try to guess a word that fits one case and tests the unknown letters.

   Since we have E fixed at 4, we can focus on the other positions.

   Let's list possible words? 

   Case 1: A at 1, S at 2 -> word: A S ? E ? 
      The third and fifth positions: we need two letters? And the word must be valid? 
      Examples: 
        ASHES? But H and S? But S is already used? And we have two S? But we don't know? Also, E at 4? And S at 2? Then fifth letter? But ""ASHES"" has S at 5? But we have S at 2? So duplicate S? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in feedback, we haven't seen duplicate? So maybe? But let's check: 
          ASHES: A at 1, S at 2, H at 3, E at 4, S at 5? But we have two S? And we know S is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? 
        However, we have to avoid absent letters? H is not absent? So it's possible? But we have to see if it fits? 
        But in ""ASHES"", we have S at 2 and S at 5? But our constraint says S must be at 2 or 5? Here it is at both? But that's two S? So the word has two S? 
        But we don't have feedback that indicates duplicates? So it's possible? 

        But note: in the feedback, when we guessed ""steal"", we had one S? And it was marked present? But that doesn't rule out two S? Similarly, in ""based"", one S? 

        However, we are trying to solve? 

        But we have to avoid absent letters? H is not absent? So ""ASHES"" is a candidate? But we have to check the constraints for A and S? 
          A at 1: allowed? Yes? 
          S at 2: allowed? Yes? 
          E at 4: fixed? 
          But we have S at 5? But we are only required to have S in the word? And we have it at 2? The S at 5 is extra? But the word has two S? 

        But the feedback for ""steal"" had one S? And it was present? But it didn't say if there are two? So it's possible? 

        However, we are guessing? We can try? But we have to consider that we have only 6 guesses? 

        Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicates? 

        Without duplicates: 
          We need two new letters? For positions 3 and 5? 
          Examples: 
            ASKEW? But K and W? But we have E at 4? And W at 5? 
            ASKEW: A at 1, S at 2, K at 3, E at 4, W at 5? 
            But we have to avoid absent letters? K and W are not absent? 
            And constraints: 
              A at 1: allowed? 
              S at 2: allowed? 
              E at 4: fixed? 
            So it's a candidate? 

        Another: ASPEN? But P and N? N is absent? So invalid? 

        Or ""ASHEN""? H and N? N absent? Invalid.

        ""ASKED"" but D is absent? From guess 3: D is absent? So invalid.

        ""ASPEN"" invalid? 

        ""ASPER""? But R is absent? 

        ""ASSET""? But T is absent? 

        ""ASSEZ""? Not English? 

        ""ASTER""? T and R absent? 

        So ""ASKEW"" is a candidate? 

   Case 2: A at 1, S at 5 -> word: A ? ? E S
        We need two letters for positions 2 and 3? 
        Examples: 
          AWAES? Not a word? 
          AGES? Too short? 
          AGESS? Not a word? 
          ACHES? C absent? 
          AIDES? I and D? D absent? 
          AISES? I and S? But S at 5? And we have S? But if we put S at 5? Then we have one S? But we need a word: A, ?, ?, E, S? 
          Example: ""AISLE""? But L absent? 
          ""AIVER""? Not common? 
          ""ALMES""? L absent? 
          ""AMIES""? M and I? 
          ""AMIES"": A, M, I, E, S? 
          Positions: A at 1, M at 2, I at 3, E at 4, S at 5? 
          Constraints: 
            A at 1: allowed? 
            S at 5: allowed? 
            M and I: not absent? 
          So ""AMIES"" is a candidate? 

        Another: ""AXLES""? X and L? L absent? 
        ""AZOES""? Not common? 

        ""APRES""? P and R? R absent? 

        So ""AMIES"" is one? 

   Case 3: A at 5, S at 2 -> word: ? S ? E A
        We need two letters for positions 1 and 3? 
        Examples: 
          USAEA? Not a word? 
          ISLEA? L absent? 
          MESEA? Not a word? 
          USE A? 
          ""USNEA""? But N absent? 
          ""PSYCH""? Not? 
          ""OSSEA""? O and S? But S at 2? Then we have two S? 
          ""OSSEA"": O at 1, S at 2, S at 3? But we have two S? And E at 4, A at 5? 
          But S at 3? But we have constraint: S cannot be at position 3? From guess 3: S was at 3 and was wrong? So S cannot be at 3? Therefore, we cannot have S at 3? So ""OSSEA"" is invalid? 

          Without duplicate: 
            ""USE A"" -> ""USAGE""? But G? 
            ""USAGE"": U at 1, S at 2, A at 3? But A cannot be at position 3? Because from crane: A not at 3? So invalid? 

          ""ISSEA""? I at 1, S at 2, S at 3? But S at 3 not allowed? 

          ""PSHAW""? Not? 

          ""WISEA""? W at 1, I at 2? But we need S at 2? So no? 

          We need S at position 2? So position 1: a letter? Position 3: a letter? 

          Example: ""MISER""? But R absent? 
          ""MISED""? D absent? 
          ""MISES""? But S at 5? But we have A at 5? 
          We have to have A at 5? So the word must end with A? 

          ""VISEA""? V at 1, I at 3? But we have S at 2? Then E at 4, A at 5? 
          ""VISEA"" is not a word? 

          ""USNEA"" is not? 

          ""OSSEA"" is not? 

          ""ASSEA"" not? 

          ""ISSEA"" not? 

          ""PSHAW"" not? 

          ""WISHA""? W at 1, I at 2? But we need S at 2? So position 2 must be S? 

          How about ""USURE""? Not? 

          It's hard? Maybe no common word? 

          Another: ""PSYCH"" not? 

          ""SHYER""? But S at 1? Not allowed? 

          ""SWEAT""? But T absent? 

          ""SWEAL""? L absent? 

          ""SWEAR""? R absent? 

          ""SWEAM""? Not a word? 

          ""SWEAN""? N absent? 

          So maybe case 3 is impossible? 

          Therefore, we can focus on case 1 and case 2? 

   Given the difficulty of case 3, we can ignore it? 

   Now, we have two main cases? 

   We can try to guess a word that fits case 1 or case 2? 

   For case 1: A at 1, S at 2 -> pattern A S _ E _ 
      We need to fill positions 3 and 5? 
      We tried ""ASKEW"" (with K and W) -> valid? 

   For case 2: A at 1, S at 5 -> pattern A _ _ E S 
      We have ""AMIES"" (with M and I) -> valid? 

   We don't know which case? So we can try one? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that tests both? 

   But note: we have only two guesses left? We are at guess 4? 

   We can try a word that has A at 1? Then we can see if S is at 2 or 5? 

   For example, if we guess a word with A at 1 and S at 2? Then if the feedback shows S at 2 is correct? Then we know? Or if we guess A at 1 and S at 5? 

   But we don't know? 

   We can try ""ASKEW"" for case 1? 

   If we guess ""ASKEW"":
      A at 1: if the secret word has A at 1? Then it will be marked correct? Or if not? 
      But in case 1, A is at 1? So if we get A correct? Then we know? 
      Similarly, S at 2: if correct? Then we know? 

      But if the secret word is case 2? Then A at 1 is correct? But S at 2? In case 2, S is at 5? So if we guess ""ASKEW"", then in case 2, the S at 2 would be absent? But we know S is in the word? So it would be marked as present but wrong position? 

      Similarly, if we guess ""AMIES"" for case 2? Then in case 1, A at 1 is correct? But M at 2? In case 1, position 2 is S? So M would be absent? 

   So we can distinguish? 

   But we have to choose one? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't commit to either? But we have to include A and S? 

   How about a word that has A at 5? To test case 3? But we think case 3 is unlikely? 

   Or we can try a word that has S at 5? And A at 1? But that's case 2? 

   Given the time, let's choose ""ASKEW"" to test case 1? 

   If ""ASKEW"" is the secret word? Then we win? 

   If not, we get feedback? 

   So I'll guess ""ASKEW"". 

   But let's check the constraints for ""ASKEW"":
      A at 1: allowed? Yes? 
      S at 2: allowed? Yes? 
      K at 3: new letter? 
      E at 4: fixed? 
      W at 5: new? 

   And no absent letters? 

   So <guess>askew</guess> 

   But note: we have to consider that in case 2, the word has A at 1 and S at 5? So if we guess ""ASKEW"", then:
      A: if the secret word has A at 1? Then it will be correct? 
      S: if the secret word has S at 5? Then S at 2 would be wrong? So we get S as present but not at 2? 
      K: might be present or not? 
      E: correct? 
      W: might be present or not? 

   So we can get information? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at 1 and S at 5? Like ""AMIES""? 

   But I think ""ASKEW"" is a good guess? 

   Let's see if there is a word that covers more? 

   How about ""AISLE""? But L absent? 

   ""AESIR""? But E at 1? But we have E fixed at 4? So not? 

   I think we have to choose? 

   I'll go with ""ASKEW"". 

   But note: we have to avoid using absent letters? And we did? 

   So guess: ""ASKEW""
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** (✓ in ""based"").
- **A and S are in the word** but not at positions 2, 3, or 4 for A (from ""crane"", ""steal"", and ""based"") and not at positions 1 or 3 for S (from ""steal"" and ""based"").
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, T, L, B, D (all marked ""x"").
- **Remaining possible positions**:
  - A can only be at position 1 or 5.
  - S can only be at position 2 or 5 (but cannot share position 5 with A if both are present).

Given E is fixed at position 4, the secret word pattern is `_ _ _ E _`. The most plausible configurations are:
- **Case 1**: A at 1, S at 2 → `A S _ E _`
- **Case 2**: A at 1, S at 5 → `A _ _ E S`
- **Case 3**: A at 5, S at 2 → `_ S _ E A` (less likely due to limited word options).

To test these cases efficiently, **ASKEW** is chosen as the next guess because:
- It tests **Case 1** directly: A at position 1, S at position 2.
- It uses new common letters (K, W) not previously tried.
- It avoids absent letters and respects position constraints:
  - A at 1 (allowed).
  - S at 2 (allowed).
  - E at 4 (fixed and correct).
- Feedback will help distinguish between cases:
  - If A or S is correct, it validates Case 1.
  - If S is misplaced (e.g., present but not at 2), it suggests Case 2 or 3.

<guess>askew</guess>",askew,"We have feedback from three guesses:

  A: - (present, wrong position) -> A is in the word, but not at position 4
  L: x (absent)

Guess 3: ""based""
  B: x (absent)
  A: - (present, wrong position) -> A is in the word, but not at position 2 (since in ""based"", A was at position 2)
  S: - (present, wrong position) -> S is in the word, but not at position 3 (since in ""based"", S was at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct position) -> E is in the word and at position 4
  D: x (absent)

Now, we know:

1. The secret word has E at position 4 (from the correct feedback in guess 3).
2. The secret word contains A and S, but:
   - A is not at position 2, 3, or 4 (from guesses 1, 2, and 3: not at 3 from crane, not at 4 from steal, not at 2 from based).
   - S is not at position 1 (from steal) and not at position 3 (from based).

3. Absent letters: C, R, N, T, L, B, D.

4. We have E fixed at position 4: so the word is _ _ _ E _

5. A must be in the word, but cannot be at positions 2, 3, or 4. The only positions left are 1 and 5.

   Similarly, S must be in the word, but cannot be at positions 1 or 3. The positions left for S are 2, 4, and 5. But position 4 is taken by E, so S can only be at position 2 or 5.

6. Therefore, the word has:
   - Position 4: E (fixed)
   - A must be at position 1 or 5.
   - S must be at position 2 or 5.

   But note: if S is at position 5, then A cannot be at 5? So they cannot both be at 5. Therefore, we have two cases:

   Case 1: A at position 1 and S at position 2.
      Word: A S ? E ?

   Case 2: A at position 1 and S at position 5.
      Word: A ? ? E S

   Case 3: A at position 5 and S at position 2.
      Word: ? S ? E A

   But note: we have three positions to fill? Actually, we have positions 1,2,3,5 to fill? But position 4 is fixed as E.

   And we have two known letters (A and S) to place, and one more unknown letter? Because the word has 5 letters: we have E at 4, and we need to place A and S, and one more letter? Actually, we have three positions: 1,2,3,5? But we have two letters to place? No: we have to place A and S and one more letter? Because the word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 is fixed. So we have positions 1,2,3,5 to fill? But we have two letters (A and S) that must be placed? Then we need two more letters? Or one? Actually, we have to place A and S in two of the positions 1,2,3,5? And the remaining two positions? We need two more letters? But we don't know? 

   Actually, the word must contain exactly the letters: A, S, E, and two other letters? Or possibly duplicates? But we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume no duplicates? Then we have three positions to fill? Because position 4 is fixed? And we have to place A and S? So that leaves one position (either 1,2,3,5 minus the two positions taken by A and S) and one more letter? 

   Actually, we have four positions: 1,2,3,5. We have to assign A and S to two of them? And the other two positions? We need two more letters? But we have only one more position? Because 4 is fixed? So positions 1,2,3,5: that's four positions? We have to fill four positions? But we have two known letters (A and S) to place? And two more letters? 

   Therefore, the word has: 
     - E at position 4
     - A at one of {1,5}
     - S at one of {2,5} (but if A is at 5, then S cannot be at 5? So if A at 5, then S must be at 2? Similarly, if A at 1, then S can be at 2 or 5? But if S at 5, then position 2 is open? 

   And we have two more positions to fill? For example:

   Case 1: A at 1, S at 2 -> then positions 3 and 5 are open: word: A S ? E ?
   Case 2: A at 1, S at 5 -> then positions 2 and 3 are open: word: A ? ? E S
   Case 3: A at 5, S at 2 -> then positions 1 and 3 are open: word: ? S ? E A

   And we have to choose two more letters? But we have many absent letters? We know the absent letters: C, R, N, T, L, B, D. So we cannot use these.

   We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, E, A, L, B, D? But the secret word has A, S, E, and two more? The two more must be from the remaining alphabet? Excluding absent ones.

   Available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   We need to form a word that fits one of the patterns and uses two letters from the available set.

   Also, we have feedback that in ""based"", A was at position 2 and was wrong? So A is not at 2? Similarly, S was at position 3 and was wrong? So S not at 3? And we already know E is at 4? Correct.

   Now, we need to guess a word that tests the possibilities? But we have three cases? We can try to cover multiple cases? Or we can try to guess a word that fits one case and tests the unknown letters.

   Since we have E fixed at 4, we can focus on the other positions.

   Let's list possible words? 

   Case 1: A at 1, S at 2 -> word: A S ? E ? 
      The third and fifth positions: we need two letters? And the word must be valid? 
      Examples: 
        ASHES? But H and S? But S is already used? And we have two S? But we don't know? Also, E at 4? And S at 2? Then fifth letter? But ""ASHES"" has S at 5? But we have S at 2? So duplicate S? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in feedback, we haven't seen duplicate? So maybe? But let's check: 
          ASHES: A at 1, S at 2, H at 3, E at 4, S at 5? But we have two S? And we know S is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? 
        However, we have to avoid absent letters? H is not absent? So it's possible? But we have to see if it fits? 
        But in ""ASHES"", we have S at 2 and S at 5? But our constraint says S must be at 2 or 5? Here it is at both? But that's two S? So the word has two S? 
        But we don't have feedback that indicates duplicates? So it's possible? 

        But note: in the feedback, when we guessed ""steal"", we had one S? And it was marked present? But that doesn't rule out two S? Similarly, in ""based"", one S? 

        However, we are trying to solve? 

        But we have to avoid absent letters? H is not absent? So ""ASHES"" is a candidate? But we have to check the constraints for A and S? 
          A at 1: allowed? Yes? 
          S at 2: allowed? Yes? 
          E at 4: fixed? 
          But we have S at 5? But we are only required to have S in the word? And we have it at 2? The S at 5 is extra? But the word has two S? 

        But the feedback for ""steal"" had one S? And it was present? But it didn't say if there are two? So it's possible? 

        However, we are guessing? We can try? But we have to consider that we have only 6 guesses? 

        Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicates? 

        Without duplicates: 
          We need two new letters? For positions 3 and 5? 
          Examples: 
            ASKEW? But K and W? But we have E at 4? And W at 5? 
            ASKEW: A at 1, S at 2, K at 3, E at 4, W at 5? 
            But we have to avoid absent letters? K and W are not absent? 
            And constraints: 
              A at 1: allowed? 
              S at 2: allowed? 
              E at 4: fixed? 
            So it's a candidate? 

        Another: ASPEN? But P and N? N is absent? So invalid? 

        Or ""ASHEN""? H and N? N absent? Invalid.

        ""ASKED"" but D is absent? From guess 3: D is absent? So invalid.

        ""ASPEN"" invalid? 

        ""ASPER""? But R is absent? 

        ""ASSET""? But T is absent? 

        ""ASSEZ""? Not English? 

        ""ASTER""? T and R absent? 

        So ""ASKEW"" is a candidate? 

   Case 2: A at 1, S at 5 -> word: A ? ? E S
        We need two letters for positions 2 and 3? 
        Examples: 
          AWAES? Not a word? 
          AGES? Too short? 
          AGESS? Not a word? 
          ACHES? C absent? 
          AIDES? I and D? D absent? 
          AISES? I and S? But S at 5? And we have S? But if we put S at 5? Then we have one S? But we need a word: A, ?, ?, E, S? 
          Example: ""AISLE""? But L absent? 
          ""AIVER""? Not common? 
          ""ALMES""? L absent? 
          ""AMIES""? M and I? 
          ""AMIES"": A, M, I, E, S? 
          Positions: A at 1, M at 2, I at 3, E at 4, S at 5? 
          Constraints: 
            A at 1: allowed? 
            S at 5: allowed? 
            M and I: not absent? 
          So ""AMIES"" is a candidate? 

        Another: ""AXLES""? X and L? L absent? 
        ""AZOES""? Not common? 

        ""APRES""? P and R? R absent? 

        So ""AMIES"" is one? 

   Case 3: A at 5, S at 2 -> word: ? S ? E A
        We need two letters for positions 1 and 3? 
        Examples: 
          USAEA? Not a word? 
          ISLEA? L absent? 
          MESEA? Not a word? 
          USE A? 
          ""USNEA""? But N absent? 
          ""PSYCH""? Not? 
          ""OSSEA""? O and S? But S at 2? Then we have two S? 
          ""OSSEA"": O at 1, S at 2, S at 3? But we have two S? And E at 4, A at 5? 
          But S at 3? But we have constraint: S cannot be at position 3? From guess 3: S was at 3 and was wrong? So S cannot be at 3? Therefore, we cannot have S at 3? So ""OSSEA"" is invalid? 

          Without duplicate: 
            ""USE A"" -> ""USAGE""? But G? 
            ""USAGE"": U at 1, S at 2, A at 3? But A cannot be at position 3? Because from crane: A not at 3? So invalid? 

          ""ISSEA""? I at 1, S at 2, S at 3? But S at 3 not allowed? 

          ""PSHAW""? Not? 

          ""WISEA""? W at 1, I at 2? But we need S at 2? So no? 

          We need S at position 2? So position 1: a letter? Position 3: a letter? 

          Example: ""MISER""? But R absent? 
          ""MISED""? D absent? 
          ""MISES""? But S at 5? But we have A at 5? 
          We have to have A at 5? So the word must end with A? 

          ""VISEA""? V at 1, I at 3? But we have S at 2? Then E at 4, A at 5? 
          ""VISEA"" is not a word? 

          ""USNEA"" is not? 

          ""OSSEA"" is not? 

          ""ASSEA"" not? 

          ""ISSEA"" not? 

          ""PSHAW"" not? 

          ""WISHA""? W at 1, I at 2? But we need S at 2? So position 2 must be S? 

          How about ""USURE""? Not? 

          It's hard? Maybe no common word? 

          Another: ""PSYCH"" not? 

          ""SHYER""? But S at 1? Not allowed? 

          ""SWEAT""? But T absent? 

          ""SWEAL""? L absent? 

          ""SWEAR""? R absent? 

          ""SWEAM""? Not a word? 

          ""SWEAN""? N absent? 

          So maybe case 3 is impossible? 

          Therefore, we can focus on case 1 and case 2? 

   Given the difficulty of case 3, we can ignore it? 

   Now, we have two main cases? 

   We can try to guess a word that fits case 1 or case 2? 

   For case 1: A at 1, S at 2 -> pattern A S _ E _ 
      We need to fill positions 3 and 5? 
      We tried ""ASKEW"" (with K and W) -> valid? 

   For case 2: A at 1, S at 5 -> pattern A _ _ E S 
      We have ""AMIES"" (with M and I) -> valid? 

   We don't know which case? So we can try one? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that tests both? 

   But note: we have only two guesses left? We are at guess 4? 

   We can try a word that has A at 1? Then we can see if S is at 2 or 5? 

   For example, if we guess a word with A at 1 and S at 2? Then if the feedback shows S at 2 is correct? Then we know? Or if we guess A at 1 and S at 5? 

   But we don't know? 

   We can try ""ASKEW"" for case 1? 

   If we guess ""ASKEW"":
      A at 1: if the secret word has A at 1? Then it will be marked correct? Or if not? 
      But in case 1, A is at 1? So if we get A correct? Then we know? 
      Similarly, S at 2: if correct? Then we know? 

      But if the secret word is case 2? Then A at 1 is correct? But S at 2? In case 2, S is at 5? So if we guess ""ASKEW"", then in case 2, the S at 2 would be absent? But we know S is in the word? So it would be marked as present but wrong position? 

      Similarly, if we guess ""AMIES"" for case 2? Then in case 1, A at 1 is correct? But M at 2? In case 1, position 2 is S? So M would be absent? 

   So we can distinguish? 

   But we have to choose one? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't commit to either? But we have to include A and S? 

   How about a word that has A at 5? To test case 3? But we think case 3 is unlikely? 

   Or we can try a word that has S at 5? And A at 1? But that's case 2? 

   Given the time, let's choose ""ASKEW"" to test case 1? 

   If ""ASKEW"" is the secret word? Then we win? 

   If not, we get feedback? 

   So I'll guess ""ASKEW"". 

   But let's check the constraints for ""ASKEW"":
      A at 1: allowed? Yes? 
      S at 2: allowed? Yes? 
      K at 3: new letter? 
      E at 4: fixed? 
      W at 5: new? 

   And no absent letters? 

   So <guess>askew</guess> 

   But note: we have to consider that in case 2, the word has A at 1 and S at 5? So if we guess ""ASKEW"", then:
      A: if the secret word has A at 1? Then it will be correct? 
      S: if the secret word has S at 5? Then S at 2 would be wrong? So we get S as present but not at 2? 
      K: might be present or not? 
      E: correct? 
      W: might be present or not? 

   So we can get information? 

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at 1 and S at 5? Like ""AMIES""? 

   But I think ""ASKEW"" is a good guess? 

   Let's see if there is a word that covers more? 

   How about ""AISLE""? But L absent? 

   ""AESIR""? But E at 1? But we have E fixed at 4? So not? 

   I think we have to choose? 

   I'll go with ""ASKEW"". 

   But note: we have to avoid using absent letters? And we did? 

   So guess: ""ASKEW""After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** (✓ in ""based"").
- **A and S are in the word** but not at positions 2, 3, or 4 for A (from ""crane"", ""steal"", and ""based"") and not at positions 1 or 3 for S (from ""steal"" and ""based"").
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, T, L, B, D (all marked ""x"").
- **Remaining possible positions**:
  - A can only be at position 1 or 5.
  - S can only be at position 2 or 5 (but cannot share position 5 with A if both are present).

Given E is fixed at position 4, the secret word pattern is `_ _ _ E _`. The most plausible configurations are:
- **Case 1**: A at 1, S at 2 → `A S _ E _`
- **Case 2**: A at 1, S at 5 → `A _ _ E S`
- **Case 3**: A at 5, S at 2 → `_ S _ E A` (less likely due to limited word options).

To test these cases efficiently, **ASKEW** is chosen as the next guess because:
- It tests **Case 1** directly: A at position 1, S at position 2.
- It uses new common letters (K, W) not previously tried.
- It avoids absent letters and respects position constraints:
  - A at 1 (allowed).
  - S at 2 (allowed).
  - E at 4 (fixed and correct).
- Feedback will help distinguish between cases:
  - If A or S is correct, it validates Case 1.
  - If S is misplaced (e.g., present but not at 2), it suggests Case 2 or 3.",Guess 4: askew -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) S(✓) K(✓) E(✓) W(✓),SUCCESS
