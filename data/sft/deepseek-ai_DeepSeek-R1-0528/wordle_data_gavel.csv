We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters A and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 3 and 5 respectively).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains A and E, but not C, R, or N.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, or N (since they are absent).
- Includes A and E, but in different positions than the first guess (since in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and E at position 5, and they were marked as wrong position).
- Tries to include other common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for A and E:
- A was at position 3 in the first guess, so it cannot be at position 3 in the secret word. Therefore, A must be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- E was at position 5 in the first guess, so it cannot be at position 5. Therefore, E must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also want to use other common consonants. Since C, R, N are out, we can try letters like S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

Let's think of words that have A and E, and avoid C, R, N.

One common starting word is ""SLATE"", but let's check:
- S, L, A, T, E.
- We know A and E are in the word, so that's good.

But note: in ""SLATE"", A is at position 3 and E at position 5. However, in our first guess ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning A is not at position 3 in the secret word. Similarly, E was at position 5 and marked wrong, so E is not at position 5.

Therefore, if we use ""SLATE"", we would be putting A at position 3 again (which we know is incorrect) and E at position 5 (which we know is incorrect). That might not be the best use because we already know those positions are wrong.

We should try to put A and E in new positions.

For example, we could try a word with A at position 1 and E at position 2? But that might not be common.

Alternatively, we can try to put A at position 1 and E at position 4? Or A at position 4 and E at position 2, etc.

Let's list some words that contain A and E, without C, R, N.

Possible words:
- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A at position 2, E at position 5. But E at position 5 is the same as before? We know E is not at position 5, so that would be a waste. Also, we don't know about U.

- ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T -> E at position 2, A at position 3. But A at position 3 is the same as the first guess and we know it's not there. So that would be bad.

- ""TALES"": T, A, L, E, S -> A at position 2, E at position 4. This seems better because A is not at 3 and E is not at 5.

But note: we also want to test other letters. We have only used A and E so far, and we know the word has at least two letters: A and E.

Another idea: ""STALE"" -> S, T, A, L, E -> A at position 3 (again, same as before) and E at position 5 (same as before). Not good.

We need to avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.

Let me try to find a word with A and E, without C, R, N, and with A not at 3 and E not at 5.

Consider:
- ""ADIEU"": This has A at 1, D, I, E at 4, U. But we don't know about I, D, U. Also, it has two vowels and might not be the best for getting consonant information.

- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at 3 (bad) and E at 5 (bad).

- ""LATTE"": L, A, T, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 is bad.

- ""TASTE"": T, A, S, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. Again, E at 5 is bad.

It's challenging to avoid position 5 for E. Maybe we can put E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

How about ""EAGLE""? But it has G and L, and A at 2, E at 1. But we don't know about G and L. Also, note that ""EAGLE"" has E at position 1 and A at position 2. That's new.

But wait, we also have to avoid R and N? ""EAGLE"" doesn't have R or N, so that's okay.

But let me check: E at position 1? We don't know if that's allowed. Similarly, A at position 2.

Another word: ""BEADS"": B, E, A, D, S -> E at 1, A at 3. But A at 3 is the same as before? We know A is not at 3, so that would be bad.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

So, for A, positions allowed: 1, 2, 4, 5.
For E, positions allowed: 1, 2, 3, 4.

So, we can try:
- A at 1: words like ""ABYSS"", but that has Y and S, and no E? We need E.

- A at 1 and E at 2: ""AEGIS"" (but not common), ""AESIR"" (not common).

- A at 1 and E at 3: ""ALIKE"" -> A at 1, E at 5? No, E is at 5? We cannot have E at 5.

""ALIKE"": A at 1, L, I, K, E at 5 -> E at 5 is bad.

- A at 1 and E at 4: ""ADIEU"" (as before) or ""AGLEE"" (not common).

- A at 2 and E at 1: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, A at 2, R? But R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word because in the first guess R was at position 2 and marked x (not in the word). So we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, so ""EARLY"" is invalid.

Similarly, we cannot use any word with R.

So, let's think of words without C, R, N, and with A and E in new positions.

Another idea: ""SALET"" (a word in word lists) -> S, A, L, E, T. But in this, A is at position 2? Let's see: 
Position 1: S, 2: A, 3: L, 4: E, 5: T.
So A at 2 (new position) and E at 4 (new position, not 5). This seems good.

But wait, in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and now we are putting A at position 2. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 4.

Also, we are testing S, L, T.

So, ""SALET"" is a valid word? I think it is (a variant of sallet, but accepted in Wordle).

Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but rearrange? But we can't rearrange arbitrarily.

Another common word: ""STALE"" has A at 3 and E at 5, which we want to avoid.

So, ""SALET"" seems a good choice.

But let me confirm the positions:
- S at 1
- A at 2
- L at 3
- E at 4
- T at 5

We know E cannot be at 5, but in this word E is at 4, so that's fine. And A is at 2, not 3, so also fine.

We are testing S, A, L, E, T. We don't know about S, L, T.

So, I think ""SALET"" is a good second guess.

But note: we are also trying to get information about the positions of A and E. Since we know A is in the word but not at position 3, and we are putting it at 2, if it turns out to be correct, we get a green. Similarly, E is not at 5, and we put it at 4.

Alternatively, we could try a word that puts A at position 4 or 5? But that might be less common.

Another word: ""LEAPT"" -> L, E, A, P, T. But E at 1, A at 3. We know A is not at 3, so that would be bad.

""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 is bad.

""TAPES"": T, A, P, E, S -> A at 2, E at 4. This is good: A at 2, E at 4. And letters T, P, S.

But ""TAPES"" is a word.

Similarly, ""PATES"": P, A, T, E, S -> same as above.

I think ""SALET"" or ""TAPES"" are both reasonable.

But let's consider that we also want to cover more common letters. S, T, L are very common.

I think ""SALET"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, we can use ""AISLE"": A at 1, I, S, L, E at 5. But E at 5 is bad because we know E is not at 5.

So avoid that.

""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 bad.

So, I think ""SALET"" is a good option.

But wait, in ""SALET"", the E is at position 4. We don't know if that's the correct position or not, but at least it's not 5.

Similarly, A at 2.

We might also consider ""STEAL"": S, T, E, A, L -> E at 3, A at 5. This avoids the known bad positions: A was at 3 and now at 5 (which is new), E was at 5 and now at 3 (which is new). So that's also good.

""STEAL"": positions: 1-S, 2-T, 3-E, 4-A, 5-L.

So A is at 4 (not 3) and E is at 3 (not 5). That's acceptable.

And we test S, T, E, A, L.

I think ""STEAL"" is also a good option.

Between ""SALET"" and ""STEAL"", which one? They have the same letters: S, T, E, A, L.

But in ""SALET"", the order is S, A, L, E, T.
In ""STEAL"", the order is S, T, E, A, L.

We don't have any information about S, T, L, so both are equally good.

I'll go with ""STEAL"" because it's a more common word.

But note: in ""STEAL"", we are putting E at position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Similarly, A at position 4.

So, let's choose ""STEAL"".

But wait, we must make sure we don't use any forbidden letters. ""STEAL"" has S, T, E, A, L. No C, R, N. Good.

So, second guess: ""STEAL""

But let me double-check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was wrong position, so A is not at 3. In ""STEAL"", A is at 4, so that's a new position. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 3, which is new.

Yes.

Alternatively, we could use a word that has a different set of consonants to cover more ground, but I think S, T, L are good.

So, I'll go with ""STEAL"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A cannot be at position 3, and E cannot be at position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include A and E (since they are in the secret word), but in new positions (A not at position 3, E not at position 5).
- The word must exclude C, R, and N (as they are absent from the secret word).
- To maximize information, use common letters like S, T, and L, which haven't been tested yet.

The word ""STEAL"" meets these criteria:
- Contains A (at position 4, avoiding position 3) and E (at position 3, avoiding position 5).
- Excludes C, R, and N.
- Tests new common consonants (S, T, L) and vowels (A, E) in different positions.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and E while providing information on S, T, and L.

<guess>steal</guess>",steal,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters A and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 3 and 5 respectively).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains A and E, but not C, R, or N.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, or N (since they are absent).
- Includes A and E, but in different positions than the first guess (since in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and E at position 5, and they were marked as wrong position).
- Tries to include other common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for A and E:
- A was at position 3 in the first guess, so it cannot be at position 3 in the secret word. Therefore, A must be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- E was at position 5 in the first guess, so it cannot be at position 5. Therefore, E must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also want to use other common consonants. Since C, R, N are out, we can try letters like S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

Let's think of words that have A and E, and avoid C, R, N.

One common starting word is ""SLATE"", but let's check:
- S, L, A, T, E.
- We know A and E are in the word, so that's good.

But note: in ""SLATE"", A is at position 3 and E at position 5. However, in our first guess ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning A is not at position 3 in the secret word. Similarly, E was at position 5 and marked wrong, so E is not at position 5.

Therefore, if we use ""SLATE"", we would be putting A at position 3 again (which we know is incorrect) and E at position 5 (which we know is incorrect). That might not be the best use because we already know those positions are wrong.

We should try to put A and E in new positions.

For example, we could try a word with A at position 1 and E at position 2? But that might not be common.

Alternatively, we can try to put A at position 1 and E at position 4? Or A at position 4 and E at position 2, etc.

Let's list some words that contain A and E, without C, R, N.

Possible words:
- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A at position 2, E at position 5. But E at position 5 is the same as before? We know E is not at position 5, so that would be a waste. Also, we don't know about U.

- ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T -> E at position 2, A at position 3. But A at position 3 is the same as the first guess and we know it's not there. So that would be bad.

- ""TALES"": T, A, L, E, S -> A at position 2, E at position 4. This seems better because A is not at 3 and E is not at 5.

But note: we also want to test other letters. We have only used A and E so far, and we know the word has at least two letters: A and E.

Another idea: ""STALE"" -> S, T, A, L, E -> A at position 3 (again, same as before) and E at position 5 (same as before). Not good.

We need to avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.

Let me try to find a word with A and E, without C, R, N, and with A not at 3 and E not at 5.

Consider:
- ""ADIEU"": This has A at 1, D, I, E at 4, U. But we don't know about I, D, U. Also, it has two vowels and might not be the best for getting consonant information.

- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at 3 (bad) and E at 5 (bad).

- ""LATTE"": L, A, T, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 is bad.

- ""TASTE"": T, A, S, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. Again, E at 5 is bad.

It's challenging to avoid position 5 for E. Maybe we can put E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

How about ""EAGLE""? But it has G and L, and A at 2, E at 1. But we don't know about G and L. Also, note that ""EAGLE"" has E at position 1 and A at position 2. That's new.

But wait, we also have to avoid R and N? ""EAGLE"" doesn't have R or N, so that's okay.

But let me check: E at position 1? We don't know if that's allowed. Similarly, A at position 2.

Another word: ""BEADS"": B, E, A, D, S -> E at 1, A at 3. But A at 3 is the same as before? We know A is not at 3, so that would be bad.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

So, for A, positions allowed: 1, 2, 4, 5.
For E, positions allowed: 1, 2, 3, 4.

So, we can try:
- A at 1: words like ""ABYSS"", but that has Y and S, and no E? We need E.

- A at 1 and E at 2: ""AEGIS"" (but not common), ""AESIR"" (not common).

- A at 1 and E at 3: ""ALIKE"" -> A at 1, E at 5? No, E is at 5? We cannot have E at 5.

""ALIKE"": A at 1, L, I, K, E at 5 -> E at 5 is bad.

- A at 1 and E at 4: ""ADIEU"" (as before) or ""AGLEE"" (not common).

- A at 2 and E at 1: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, A at 2, R? But R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word because in the first guess R was at position 2 and marked x (not in the word). So we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, so ""EARLY"" is invalid.

Similarly, we cannot use any word with R.

So, let's think of words without C, R, N, and with A and E in new positions.

Another idea: ""SALET"" (a word in word lists) -> S, A, L, E, T. But in this, A is at position 2? Let's see: 
Position 1: S, 2: A, 3: L, 4: E, 5: T.
So A at 2 (new position) and E at 4 (new position, not 5). This seems good.

But wait, in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and now we are putting A at position 2. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 4.

Also, we are testing S, L, T.

So, ""SALET"" is a valid word? I think it is (a variant of sallet, but accepted in Wordle).

Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but rearrange? But we can't rearrange arbitrarily.

Another common word: ""STALE"" has A at 3 and E at 5, which we want to avoid.

So, ""SALET"" seems a good choice.

But let me confirm the positions:
- S at 1
- A at 2
- L at 3
- E at 4
- T at 5

We know E cannot be at 5, but in this word E is at 4, so that's fine. And A is at 2, not 3, so also fine.

We are testing S, A, L, E, T. We don't know about S, L, T.

So, I think ""SALET"" is a good second guess.

But note: we are also trying to get information about the positions of A and E. Since we know A is in the word but not at position 3, and we are putting it at 2, if it turns out to be correct, we get a green. Similarly, E is not at 5, and we put it at 4.

Alternatively, we could try a word that puts A at position 4 or 5? But that might be less common.

Another word: ""LEAPT"" -> L, E, A, P, T. But E at 1, A at 3. We know A is not at 3, so that would be bad.

""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 is bad.

""TAPES"": T, A, P, E, S -> A at 2, E at 4. This is good: A at 2, E at 4. And letters T, P, S.

But ""TAPES"" is a word.

Similarly, ""PATES"": P, A, T, E, S -> same as above.

I think ""SALET"" or ""TAPES"" are both reasonable.

But let's consider that we also want to cover more common letters. S, T, L are very common.

I think ""SALET"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, we can use ""AISLE"": A at 1, I, S, L, E at 5. But E at 5 is bad because we know E is not at 5.

So avoid that.

""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 bad.

So, I think ""SALET"" is a good option.

But wait, in ""SALET"", the E is at position 4. We don't know if that's the correct position or not, but at least it's not 5.

Similarly, A at 2.

We might also consider ""STEAL"": S, T, E, A, L -> E at 3, A at 5. This avoids the known bad positions: A was at 3 and now at 5 (which is new), E was at 5 and now at 3 (which is new). So that's also good.

""STEAL"": positions: 1-S, 2-T, 3-E, 4-A, 5-L.

So A is at 4 (not 3) and E is at 3 (not 5). That's acceptable.

And we test S, T, E, A, L.

I think ""STEAL"" is also a good option.

Between ""SALET"" and ""STEAL"", which one? They have the same letters: S, T, E, A, L.

But in ""SALET"", the order is S, A, L, E, T.
In ""STEAL"", the order is S, T, E, A, L.

We don't have any information about S, T, L, so both are equally good.

I'll go with ""STEAL"" because it's a more common word.

But note: in ""STEAL"", we are putting E at position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Similarly, A at position 4.

So, let's choose ""STEAL"".

But wait, we must make sure we don't use any forbidden letters. ""STEAL"" has S, T, E, A, L. No C, R, N. Good.

So, second guess: ""STEAL""

But let me double-check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was wrong position, so A is not at 3. In ""STEAL"", A is at 4, so that's a new position. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 3, which is new.

Yes.

Alternatively, we could use a word that has a different set of consonants to cover more ground, but I think S, T, L are good.

So, I'll go with ""STEAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A cannot be at position 3, and E cannot be at position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include A and E (since they are in the secret word), but in new positions (A not at position 3, E not at position 5).
- The word must exclude C, R, and N (as they are absent from the secret word).
- To maximize information, use common letters like S, T, and L, which haven't been tested yet.

The word ""STEAL"" meets these criteria:
- Contains A (at position 4, avoiding position 3) and E (at position 3, avoiding position 5).
- Excludes C, R, and N.
- Tests new common consonants (S, T, L) and vowels (A, E) in different positions.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and E while providing information on S, T, and L.",Guess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 Let's go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters A and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 3 and 5 respectively).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains A and E, but not C, R, or N.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, or N (since they are absent).
- Includes A and E, but in different positions than the first guess (since in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and E at position 5, and they were marked as wrong position).
- Tries to include other common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for A and E:
- A was at position 3 in the first guess, so it cannot be at position 3 in the secret word. Therefore, A must be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- E was at position 5 in the first guess, so it cannot be at position 5. Therefore, E must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also want to use other common consonants. Since C, R, N are out, we can try letters like S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

Let's think of words that have A and E, and avoid C, R, N.

One common starting word is ""SLATE"", but let's check:
- S, L, A, T, E.
- We know A and E are in the word, so that's good.

But note: in ""SLATE"", A is at position 3 and E at position 5. However, in our first guess ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning A is not at position 3 in the secret word. Similarly, E was at position 5 and marked wrong, so E is not at position 5.

Therefore, if we use ""SLATE"", we would be putting A at position 3 again (which we know is incorrect) and E at position 5 (which we know is incorrect). That might not be the best use because we already know those positions are wrong.

We should try to put A and E in new positions.

For example, we could try a word with A at position 1 and E at position 2? But that might not be common.

Alternatively, we can try to put A at position 1 and E at position 4? Or A at position 4 and E at position 2, etc.

Let's list some words that contain A and E, without C, R, N.

Possible words:
- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A at position 2, E at position 5. But E at position 5 is the same as before? We know E is not at position 5, so that would be a waste. Also, we don't know about U.

- ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T -> E at position 2, A at position 3. But A at position 3 is the same as the first guess and we know it's not there. So that would be bad.

- ""TALES"": T, A, L, E, S -> A at position 2, E at position 4. This seems better because A is not at 3 and E is not at 5.

But note: we also want to test other letters. We have only used A and E so far, and we know the word has at least two letters: A and E.

Another idea: ""STALE"" -> S, T, A, L, E -> A at position 3 (again, same as before) and E at position 5 (same as before). Not good.

We need to avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.

Let me try to find a word with A and E, without C, R, N, and with A not at 3 and E not at 5.

Consider:
- ""ADIEU"": This has A at 1, D, I, E at 4, U. But we don't know about I, D, U. Also, it has two vowels and might not be the best for getting consonant information.

- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at 3 (bad) and E at 5 (bad).

- ""LATTE"": L, A, T, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 is bad.

- ""TASTE"": T, A, S, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. Again, E at 5 is bad.

It's challenging to avoid position 5 for E. Maybe we can put E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

How about ""EAGLE""? But it has G and L, and A at 2, E at 1. But we don't know about G and L. Also, note that ""EAGLE"" has E at position 1 and A at position 2. That's new.

But wait, we also have to avoid R and N? ""EAGLE"" doesn't have R or N, so that's okay.

But let me check: E at position 1? We don't know if that's allowed. Similarly, A at position 2.

Another word: ""BEADS"": B, E, A, D, S -> E at 1, A at 3. But A at 3 is the same as before? We know A is not at 3, so that would be bad.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

So, for A, positions allowed: 1, 2, 4, 5.
For E, positions allowed: 1, 2, 3, 4.

So, we can try:
- A at 1: words like ""ABYSS"", but that has Y and S, and no E? We need E.

- A at 1 and E at 2: ""AEGIS"" (but not common), ""AESIR"" (not common).

- A at 1 and E at 3: ""ALIKE"" -> A at 1, E at 5? No, E is at 5? We cannot have E at 5.

""ALIKE"": A at 1, L, I, K, E at 5 -> E at 5 is bad.

- A at 1 and E at 4: ""ADIEU"" (as before) or ""AGLEE"" (not common).

- A at 2 and E at 1: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, A at 2, R? But R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word because in the first guess R was at position 2 and marked x (not in the word). So we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, so ""EARLY"" is invalid.

Similarly, we cannot use any word with R.

So, let's think of words without C, R, N, and with A and E in new positions.

Another idea: ""SALET"" (a word in word lists) -> S, A, L, E, T. But in this, A is at position 2? Let's see: 
Position 1: S, 2: A, 3: L, 4: E, 5: T.
So A at 2 (new position) and E at 4 (new position, not 5). This seems good.

But wait, in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and now we are putting A at position 2. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 4.

Also, we are testing S, L, T.

So, ""SALET"" is a valid word? I think it is (a variant of sallet, but accepted in Wordle).

Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but rearrange? But we can't rearrange arbitrarily.

Another common word: ""STALE"" has A at 3 and E at 5, which we want to avoid.

So, ""SALET"" seems a good choice.

But let me confirm the positions:
- S at 1
- A at 2
- L at 3
- E at 4
- T at 5

We know E cannot be at 5, but in this word E is at 4, so that's fine. And A is at 2, not 3, so also fine.

We are testing S, A, L, E, T. We don't know about S, L, T.

So, I think ""SALET"" is a good second guess.

But note: we are also trying to get information about the positions of A and E. Since we know A is in the word but not at position 3, and we are putting it at 2, if it turns out to be correct, we get a green. Similarly, E is not at 5, and we put it at 4.

Alternatively, we could try a word that puts A at position 4 or 5? But that might be less common.

Another word: ""LEAPT"" -> L, E, A, P, T. But E at 1, A at 3. We know A is not at 3, so that would be bad.

""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 is bad.

""TAPES"": T, A, P, E, S -> A at 2, E at 4. This is good: A at 2, E at 4. And letters T, P, S.

But ""TAPES"" is a word.

Similarly, ""PATES"": P, A, T, E, S -> same as above.

I think ""SALET"" or ""TAPES"" are both reasonable.

But let's consider that we also want to cover more common letters. S, T, L are very common.

I think ""SALET"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, we can use ""AISLE"": A at 1, I, S, L, E at 5. But E at 5 is bad because we know E is not at 5.

So avoid that.

""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 bad.

So, I think ""SALET"" is a good option.

But wait, in ""SALET"", the E is at position 4. We don't know if that's the correct position or not, but at least it's not 5.

Similarly, A at 2.

We might also consider ""STEAL"": S, T, E, A, L -> E at 3, A at 5. This avoids the known bad positions: A was at 3 and now at 5 (which is new), E was at 5 and now at 3 (which is new). So that's also good.

""STEAL"": positions: 1-S, 2-T, 3-E, 4-A, 5-L.

So A is at 4 (not 3) and E is at 3 (not 5). That's acceptable.

And we test S, T, E, A, L.

I think ""STEAL"" is also a good option.

Between ""SALET"" and ""STEAL"", which one? They have the same letters: S, T, E, A, L.

But in ""SALET"", the order is S, A, L, E, T.
In ""STEAL"", the order is S, T, E, A, L.

We don't have any information about S, T, L, so both are equally good.

I'll go with ""STEAL"" because it's a more common word.

But note: in ""STEAL"", we are putting E at position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Similarly, A at position 4.

So, let's choose ""STEAL"".

But wait, we must make sure we don't use any forbidden letters. ""STEAL"" has S, T, E, A, L. No C, R, N. Good.

So, second guess: ""STEAL""

But let me double-check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was wrong position, so A is not at 3. In ""STEAL"", A is at 4, so that's a new position. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 3, which is new.

Yes.

Alternatively, we could use a word that has a different set of consonants to cover more ground, but I think S, T, L are good.

So, I'll go with ""STEAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A cannot be at position 3, and E cannot be at position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include A and E (since they are in the secret word), but in new positions (A not at position 3, E not at position 5).
- The word must exclude C, R, and N (as they are absent from the secret word).
- To maximize information, use common letters like S, T, and L, which haven't been tested yet.

The word ""STEAL"" meets these criteria:
- Contains A (at position 4, avoiding position 3) and E (at position 3, avoiding position 5).
- Excludes C, R, and N.
- Tests new common consonants (S, T, L) and vowels (A, E) in different positions.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and E while providing information on S, T, and L.

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess: ""crane""
   - C: x (C not in the word)
   - R: x (R not in the word)
   - A: - (A is in the word, but not at position 3)
   - N: x (N not in the word)
   - E: - (E is in the word, but not at position 5)

2. Second guess: ""steal""
   - S: x (S not in the word)
   - T: x (T not in the word)
   - E: - (E is in the word, but not at position 3; since in ""steal"", E is at position 3)
   - A: - (A is in the word, but not at position 4; since in ""steal"", A is at position 4)
   - L: ✓ (L is in the word and at the correct position, which is position 5? Wait, in ""steal"", L is at position 5)

Let's clarify the positions in ""steal"":
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: L

Feedback for ""steal"":
- S (pos1): x -> S not in the word
- T (pos2): x -> T not in the word
- E (pos3): - -> E is in the word but not at position 3
- A (pos4): - -> A is in the word but not at position 4
- L (pos5): ✓ -> L is in the word and at position 5

So, from this we know:
- The secret word has L at the last position (position 5).
- The word contains E and A, but E is not at position 3, and A is not at position 4.
- Also, E is not at position 5 (from first guess) and now we know E not at 3. Similarly, A not at 3 (from first guess) and now not at 4.
- Moreover, S and T are not in the word.

Additionally, from the first guess we know C, R, N are not in the word.

So, absent letters: C, R, N, S, T.
Present letters: A, E, L (with L fixed at position 5).

We also know that E and A must be in positions other than those already tried.

Possible positions for A and E:
- The word has 5 positions. Position 5 is taken by L.
- Positions available: 1, 2, 3, 4.

But constraints:
- A cannot be at positions 3 or 4 (from guesses: not at 3 in first, not at 4 in second).
- So A must be at position 1 or 2.

Similarly, E cannot be at positions 5 (from first guess) or 3 (from second guess). Also, E is in the word, so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4.

Now, we need to think of words that:
- End with L (position 5).
- Contain A and E.
- A is at position 1 or 2.
- E is at position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3 or 5).
- Exclude C, R, N, S, T.

Also, we have used all 6 tries? No, we have used 2, so 4 left.

Now, let's consider combinations:

Case 1: A at position 1.
Then the word starts with A, ends with L. So pattern: A _ _ _ L.

Now, E must be at position 2 or 4 (since cannot be at 1? Wait, E can be at position 1? But if A is at position 1, then E cannot be at 1. So for E, positions available: 2 and 4.

Similarly, if A is at position 1, then position 1 is taken by A, so E cannot be at 1. Therefore, E must be at 2 or 4.

Now, the word has two more letters? Actually, it must have A, E, and L, and two more letters. But we have only three known to be in the word: A, E, L. However, the word might have more letters, or duplicated? But so far we haven't seen duplicates.

But we don't know if there are duplicates. However, since we got only one green and two yellows so far, and the word might have 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily.

But let's proceed without duplication assumption unless forced.

So, pattern: A _ _ _ L, with E at position 2 or 4.

Also, the unknown positions (if E at 2, then positions 3 and 4; if E at 4, then positions 2 and 3) must be filled with letters not forbidden.

Forbidden letters: C, R, N, S, T.

Available letters: all others except A, E, L and forbidden? But we don't know what else.

Common letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, Case 2: A at position 2.
Then word pattern: _ A _ _ L, with E at position 1, 2, or 4. But position 2 is A, so E cannot be at 2. Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 4.

So:
- Subcase 2a: E at 1 -> E A _ _ L
- Subcase 2b: E at 4 -> _ A _ E L

We need to consider all possibilities and think of words.

Given we are making the third guess, we want to test multiple possibilities at once.

We also know that E cannot be at position 3 or 5. And A cannot be at 3 or 4.

First, let me try to list possible words.

Possible words with L at end and A and E present:

- With A at 1: ""ABEL?"" not a word. ""ADEL"", but not common. ""AISLE"": A at 1, I, S, L, E at 5? But E at 5 is already forbidden? Also, S is forbidden now. ""AISLE"" has S? Yes, and S is not in word. So no.

Other words: ""ALIKE"": A at 1, L at 2, but then L at 2 and 5? And E at 5, which is forbidden.

""AMPLE"": A at 1, M, P, L, E at 5? But E at 5 forbidden.

""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E? But E at 5 forbidden.

So, for A at position 1, we need E at position 2 or 4.

With E position 2: word pattern: A E ? ? L

What words? ""AEGIS"" not 5 letters? ""AEONS"" but has S and N? Not allowed.

""AEONS"" has N and S, forbidden.

Not coming up with many. Let's think: ""ANGEL"" but has N, forbidden.

Perhaps ""AVIEW"" not a word.

Maybe A at 1 is not common? But we must try.

With E at position 4: pattern A ? ? E L

Examples: ""AUDEL"" not a word? ""AXEL"": A, X, E, L? But that's only 4? ""AXLE"" is a word: A, X, L, E. But that's 4 letters. No, ""axle"" is 4 letters. We need 5. So ""APPEL"": A, P, P, E, L? That's 5: A-P-P-E-L. But E at position 4? And L at 5. E is at position 4? Position: 1-A, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E, 5-L.

Yes, ""APPEL"" is a word. But it has double P? And we don't know about P.

Similarly, ""AMEL"" not 5.

Another idea: ""ABLED"": but has B,L,E,D, but structure: A,B,L,E,D? Not A? Position 1:A, 2:B, 3:L, 4:E, 5:D? But L is at position 3, and we need L at 5? No. L must be at 5. So the word ends with L, so last letter L.

So pattern for A? and E? with L last.

With A at 1 and E at 4: e.g., ""ANVIL""? But N forbidden. ""AWEEL"" not word.

Perhaps no common words? Try case 2.

Case 2: A at position 2.

Then pattern: _ A _ _ L

And E at position 1 or 4.

First, E at position 1: pattern E A _ _ L

Words: ""EAGLE"": E, A, G, L, E? But E at 1 and E at 5? But position 5 is L? ""EAGLE"": E-A-G-L-E? Positions: 1-E, 2-A, 3-G, 4-L, 5-E. But L at position 4? But we know L is at position 5, so cannot be. Also, E at 5? But forbidden.

""EARLY"": E, A, R, L, Y? But R is forbidden.

""EATEN"": E, A, T, E, N? But T and N forbidden.

""EBOLA"": E, B, O, L, A? But L at 4, A at 5? We need L at 5, so A cannot be at 5? ""EBOLA"" ends with A? No, E-B-O-L-A. So L at 4? Not 5.

Thus, L must be last, so position 5 is L, so in ""EA_ _ L"", the blanks must be filled.

Words like ""EASEL"": E, A, S, E, L? S forbidden, and L at position 5? Structure: 1-E, 2-A, 3-S, 4-E, 5-L. Yes, but S forbidden.

Other words? Hard to find.

Now, subcase E at 4: pattern _ A _ E L

So position: 1: ?, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: L

And the first and third positions cannot be forbidden letters.

Examples: ""HALEL"" not word? ""VALID"": V, A, L, I, D? But L at 3? And E? Not present. We need E at position 4.

""VALET"": V, A, L, E, T? Positions: 1-V, 2-A, 3-L, 4-E, 5-T. But T forbidden, and we need L at 5? No.

""MANGE"": M, A, N, G, E? But N forbidden.

""PAPER"": P, A, P, E, R? R forbidden.

""BAKER"": B, A, K, E, R? R forbidden.

""MAKER"": M, A, K, E, R? R forbidden.

""HAVEL"": not common? ""CAVIL"": C forbidden.

""DAZED"": D, A, Z, E, D? D at 1 and 5? But L at 5? Not matching.

""WAVED"": W, A, V, E, D? Again, L at 5 not present.

But we need the word to end with L.

So: for pattern _ A _ E L: the fourth letter is E, fifth is L.

So, position 3 must be filled and position 1.

Examples: Here are some words: ""Hazel"": H, A, Z, E, L -> positions: 1-H, 2-A, 3-Z, 4-E, 5-L. Yes!

""Hazel"" is a valid English word.

But we have to check if H and Z are forbidden? Not forbidden yet.

Similarly, other words: ""Fabel"" not common. ""Label"": L, A, B, E, L -> but L at position 1? And L at 5? Also, E at 4.

Yes, ""label"": L, A, B, E, L.

But we already have L at 5, so that's fine.

Similarly, ""camel"": but C forbidden.

""model"": M, O, D, E, L? Pattern: 1-M, 2-O, 3-D, 4-E, 5-L -> not A at second position? We need A at position 2.

We need position 2 to be A, position 4 to be E, position 5 to be L.

So, words like:

- ""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> not common? But acceptable.
- ""LABEL"": L, A, B, E, L -> L at 1 and 5? This might work.
- ""JAVEL"" not a word.
- ""PAVEL"" name?
- ""RAVEL"": but R forbidden.
- ""SABEL"" not common, and S forbidden? S is forbidden.
- ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but T forbidden and L at 4 not 5? And E at 5? Not matching.
- ""MAPLE"": M A P L E -> L at position 4? Not 5.

So common words: ""HAZEL"" and ""LABEL"".

In ""LABEL"", L at position 1 and position 5. That is allowed, since L could be duplicated? But we know that L is in the word only at position 5? No, the feedback showed L at position 5 correct, but it might be in other positions? We don't have information about other positions.

In the second guess, we had L at 5 green, but that doesn't mean L isn't elsewhere.

Similarly, in ""LABEL"", if we guess it, and if L is only at 5, then position 1 L would be marked accordingly.

Similarly for ""HAZEL"".

Also, we have the possibility where A is at position 1? Earlier we struggled.

Another word: ""AGILE"": A G I L E? Pattern: A at 1, E at 5? E at 5 forbidden? We know E not at position 5.

""ALIVE"": A L I V E? E at 5 forbidden.

""EXCEL"": but C forbidden, S not? E X C E L? C forbidden.

Perhaps we missed some.

What about with A at position 2 and E at position 1? Earlier ""E A _ _ L""

Words: ""EALED"" not common. ""EQUAL"": E Q U A L? Positions: 1-E, 2-Q, 3-U, 4-A, 5-L. But A at 4? We need A at 2? No, that's not A at 2.

In this pattern, for E at 1 and A at 2, then positions 3 and 4 need letters.

Example: ""EAGLE"" ? But ends with E, not L.

""EARLY"" forbidden R.

There is ""EANED"" not word.

""MANED"" has M A N E D? Not L?

I think it's harder.

Therefore, the most plausible words are ""HAZEL"" and ""LABEL"".

But we need to maximize information. Also, we have more to test.

But since we have to guess, let's pick one that tests new letters.

In ""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L. We haven't tested H and Z.

In ""LABEL"": L, A, B, E, L. We haven't tested B, and L is already known at 5 but might be duplicated.

But in ""LABEL"", we have L at position 1, which is new.

Similarly, we know E is not at 3 or 5, but in ""HAZEL"" or ""LABEL"", E is at 4.

Now, also, we know A is not at 3 or 4, so in both, A is at 2? In ""HAZEL"" and ""LABEL"", A is at position 2.

Similarly, L at 5 is fixed.

Now, we also need to consider that in the first guess, E was at position 5 (forbidden) and in the second guess E was at 3 (forbidden). Now, in ""HAZEL"" or ""LABEL"", E is at position 4, which has not been tried, so possible.

Similarly, A is at position 2, which has not been tried (in first guess A at 3, in second A at 4, now at 2).

So, both are candidates.

But let's think if there is another word I missed.

""OVAL"" not 5.

Or ""IDEAL"": but I D E A L? Pattern: 1-I, 2-D, 3-E, 4-A, 5-L. But E at position 3 is forbidden? From second guess, we know E not at position 3. So ""IDEAL"" has E at 3, invalid.

Similarly, ""VIELA"" not word.

So, ""HAZEL"" and ""LABEL"" seem the main options.

We could guess ""LABEL"" to test if L is duplicated? But we don't know.

Another word: ""BADEL"" not common.

I think we should choose one.

Perhaps ""HAZEL"" because it uses less common letters and might reduce possibilities faster? Or ""LABEL"" to test L.

But let me observe that in ""steal"", we had L at 5 correct, so if we put L at 1 in ""label"", it might tell us if L is duplicated.

But we know E is at some wrong position? We don't know about duplication.

So, let's try ""label"".

But wait, we need to confirm if ""label"" is accepted Wordle word. I believe it is.

Similarly, ""hazel"".

But we have to avoid S,T, etc.

Now, from feedback, we have L fixed at 5, and we need A at 1 or 2, and E at 1,2, or4 but not3 or5.

In ""label"", A at 2, E at 4, L at 1 and 5. So if L is not duplicated, position 1 L will be marked wrong or absent.

Similarly, in ""hazel"", H and Z are new.

Perhaps ""label"" is a safer guess.

But let's think about case with A at position 1.

I found ""ABBEY"" no E? ""ABLED"": A, B, L, E, D, but L at pos3, not5.

""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U? E at pos4, L not present.

But we need L at 5.

""ADDLE"": A, D, D, L, E? But E at5 forbidden.

""AMPLE"" forbidden E at5.

So no 5-letter words with A at1 and L at5 and E at2 or4? For example, E at2: ""A E _ _ L"" -> ""Aegis"" not 5? ""Aerie"" not.

""aeled"" not word.

Or ""aeons"" forbidden.

So, A at position 1 doesn't seem to yield valid words. Therefore, A must be at position 2.

Thus, pattern _ A _ _ L, with E at position 1 or 4.

E at1: pattern E A _ _ L -> words like ""Eagle"" not, ""Easel"" forbidden.

""Eastern"" too long.

""early"" forbidden.

E at4: pattern _ A _ E L -> words like ""label"", ""hazel"", ""maple"" but maple no E? Maple: M A P L E, E at5 forbidden.

""ample"" similar.

So, indeed, ""label"" and ""hazel"".

Now, we can choose ""label"" as a guess.

But let's see if there is ""bagel"": B A G E L? Positions: B at1, A at2, G at3, E at4, L at5. Yes, ""bagel"" is a word.

Similarly, ""basel"" not common? ""vowel"" not A.

""jewel"" no A.

So ""bagel"" is another option: B, A, G, E, L.

With B, G tested.

Similarly, ""gavel"": G A V E L? But ""gavel"" is G A V E L, so position 1-G, 2-A, 3-V, 4-E, 5-L.

Also possible.

So, possible words: ""LABEL"", ""HAZEL"", ""BAGEL"", ""GAVEL"", etc.

We have several options.

But we must choose one for third guess.

To make progress, we should choose a word that tests letters we haven't tried and covers common possibilities.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, T.

We have tried A, E, L.

Unknown letters: let's pick common ones.

""B"" and ""G"" are common in ""BAGEL"".

"" H"" and ""Z"" in ""HAZEL"" are less common.

So to eliminate more, perhaps ""bagel"" is a good choice.

With ""bagel"", we test B and G.

Similarly, ""label"" tests L at position 1 and B.

But L is already known to be in the word at position 5, so duplicating might not give as much information? But it could.

I think ""bagel"" is a solid choice.

So, I'll go with ""bagel"".

But let's confirm the positions: ""BAGEL"" -> B at1, A at2, G at3, E at4, L at5.

Constraints:
- A is at position 2: which is new (previously tried at 3 and 4, not 2).
- E is at position 4: which was tried at 5 (not allowed) and at 3 (not allowed), now at 4, new position.
- L at 5, known correct.

So, if we get feedback, we can pin down if A at 2 or E at 4 is correct.

Similarly, B at 1 and G at 3 are new.

So, good for information.

Therefore, third guess: ""bagel""

In summary:
- From first guess: A and E in word, not at positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- From second guess: L at position 5 correct; E not at 3; A not at 4. Also S and T absent.
- Thus, A must be at 1 or 2, but words with A at 1 are scarce, so likely at 2. And E at 1 or 4.
- Guessing ""BAGEL"" to test A at 2 and E at 4, and letters B and G.

<guess>bagel</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

1. **First guess: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
   - This indicates that:
     - C, R, and N are not in the secret word.
     - A is in the word but not at position 3.
     - E is in the word but not at position 5.

2. **Second guess: ""steal""** → Feedback: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(✓)
   - This indicates that:
     - S and T are not in the secret word.
     - E is in the word but not at position 3.
     - A is in the word but not at position 4.
     - L is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.

### Key Inferences:
- **Confirmed letters and positions:** 
  - L is fixed at position 5 (from the ✓ in ""steal"").
- **Letters in the word (but wrong positions):** 
  - A is in the word, but cannot be at positions 3 (from ""crane"") or 4 (from ""steal""). Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 2.
  - E is in the word, but cannot be at positions 5 (from ""crane"") or 3 (from ""steal""). Therefore, E must be at position 1, 2, or 4 (position 5 is taken by L).
- **Absent letters:** C, R, N, S, T (eliminated).
- **Word structure:** The secret word ends with L (position 5). Given the constraints on A and E, the only feasible patterns are:
  - A at position 1: Pattern `A ? ? E L` (E at position 4) or `A E ? ? L` (E at position 2). However, common English words with A at position 1 and L at position 5 are rare when avoiding the forbidden letters.
  - A at position 2: Pattern `? A ? E L` (E at position 4) or `E A ? ? L` (E at position 1). Words like ""label"", ""hazel"", ""bagel"", or ""gavel"" fit, with E at position 4 being more common.

Given this, ""bagel"" is a strong guess:
- **Structure:** `B A G E L`, placing A at position 2 (new position to test) and E at position 4 (also new, avoiding previously invalid positions).
- **Benefits:** Tests new common consonants (B and G) while satisfying all known constraints. Consistent with English words and maximizes information gain by covering multiple possibilities:
  - If A or E is correctly placed, it quickly narrows the options.
  - Tests B and G for presence/absence, helping to refine future guesses.

<guess>bagel</guess>",bagel,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess: ""crane""
   - C: x (C not in the word)
   - R: x (R not in the word)
   - A: - (A is in the word, but not at position 3)
   - N: x (N not in the word)
   - E: - (E is in the word, but not at position 5)

2. Second guess: ""steal""
   - S: x (S not in the word)
   - T: x (T not in the word)
   - E: - (E is in the word, but not at position 3; since in ""steal"", E is at position 3)
   - A: - (A is in the word, but not at position 4; since in ""steal"", A is at position 4)
   - L: ✓ (L is in the word and at the correct position, which is position 5? Wait, in ""steal"", L is at position 5)

Let's clarify the positions in ""steal"":
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: L

Feedback for ""steal"":
- S (pos1): x -> S not in the word
- T (pos2): x -> T not in the word
- E (pos3): - -> E is in the word but not at position 3
- A (pos4): - -> A is in the word but not at position 4
- L (pos5): ✓ -> L is in the word and at position 5

So, from this we know:
- The secret word has L at the last position (position 5).
- The word contains E and A, but E is not at position 3, and A is not at position 4.
- Also, E is not at position 5 (from first guess) and now we know E not at 3. Similarly, A not at 3 (from first guess) and now not at 4.
- Moreover, S and T are not in the word.

Additionally, from the first guess we know C, R, N are not in the word.

So, absent letters: C, R, N, S, T.
Present letters: A, E, L (with L fixed at position 5).

We also know that E and A must be in positions other than those already tried.

Possible positions for A and E:
- The word has 5 positions. Position 5 is taken by L.
- Positions available: 1, 2, 3, 4.

But constraints:
- A cannot be at positions 3 or 4 (from guesses: not at 3 in first, not at 4 in second).
- So A must be at position 1 or 2.

Similarly, E cannot be at positions 5 (from first guess) or 3 (from second guess). Also, E is in the word, so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4.

Now, we need to think of words that:
- End with L (position 5).
- Contain A and E.
- A is at position 1 or 2.
- E is at position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3 or 5).
- Exclude C, R, N, S, T.

Also, we have used all 6 tries? No, we have used 2, so 4 left.

Now, let's consider combinations:

Case 1: A at position 1.
Then the word starts with A, ends with L. So pattern: A _ _ _ L.

Now, E must be at position 2 or 4 (since cannot be at 1? Wait, E can be at position 1? But if A is at position 1, then E cannot be at 1. So for E, positions available: 2 and 4.

Similarly, if A is at position 1, then position 1 is taken by A, so E cannot be at 1. Therefore, E must be at 2 or 4.

Now, the word has two more letters? Actually, it must have A, E, and L, and two more letters. But we have only three known to be in the word: A, E, L. However, the word might have more letters, or duplicated? But so far we haven't seen duplicates.

But we don't know if there are duplicates. However, since we got only one green and two yellows so far, and the word might have 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily.

But let's proceed without duplication assumption unless forced.

So, pattern: A _ _ _ L, with E at position 2 or 4.

Also, the unknown positions (if E at 2, then positions 3 and 4; if E at 4, then positions 2 and 3) must be filled with letters not forbidden.

Forbidden letters: C, R, N, S, T.

Available letters: all others except A, E, L and forbidden? But we don't know what else.

Common letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, Case 2: A at position 2.
Then word pattern: _ A _ _ L, with E at position 1, 2, or 4. But position 2 is A, so E cannot be at 2. Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 4.

So:
- Subcase 2a: E at 1 -> E A _ _ L
- Subcase 2b: E at 4 -> _ A _ E L

We need to consider all possibilities and think of words.

Given we are making the third guess, we want to test multiple possibilities at once.

We also know that E cannot be at position 3 or 5. And A cannot be at 3 or 4.

First, let me try to list possible words.

Possible words with L at end and A and E present:

- With A at 1: ""ABEL?"" not a word. ""ADEL"", but not common. ""AISLE"": A at 1, I, S, L, E at 5? But E at 5 is already forbidden? Also, S is forbidden now. ""AISLE"" has S? Yes, and S is not in word. So no.

Other words: ""ALIKE"": A at 1, L at 2, but then L at 2 and 5? And E at 5, which is forbidden.

""AMPLE"": A at 1, M, P, L, E at 5? But E at 5 forbidden.

""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E? But E at 5 forbidden.

So, for A at position 1, we need E at position 2 or 4.

With E position 2: word pattern: A E ? ? L

What words? ""AEGIS"" not 5 letters? ""AEONS"" but has S and N? Not allowed.

""AEONS"" has N and S, forbidden.

Not coming up with many. Let's think: ""ANGEL"" but has N, forbidden.

Perhaps ""AVIEW"" not a word.

Maybe A at 1 is not common? But we must try.

With E at position 4: pattern A ? ? E L

Examples: ""AUDEL"" not a word? ""AXEL"": A, X, E, L? But that's only 4? ""AXLE"" is a word: A, X, L, E. But that's 4 letters. No, ""axle"" is 4 letters. We need 5. So ""APPEL"": A, P, P, E, L? That's 5: A-P-P-E-L. But E at position 4? And L at 5. E is at position 4? Position: 1-A, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E, 5-L.

Yes, ""APPEL"" is a word. But it has double P? And we don't know about P.

Similarly, ""AMEL"" not 5.

Another idea: ""ABLED"": but has B,L,E,D, but structure: A,B,L,E,D? Not A? Position 1:A, 2:B, 3:L, 4:E, 5:D? But L is at position 3, and we need L at 5? No. L must be at 5. So the word ends with L, so last letter L.

So pattern for A? and E? with L last.

With A at 1 and E at 4: e.g., ""ANVIL""? But N forbidden. ""AWEEL"" not word.

Perhaps no common words? Try case 2.

Case 2: A at position 2.

Then pattern: _ A _ _ L

And E at position 1 or 4.

First, E at position 1: pattern E A _ _ L

Words: ""EAGLE"": E, A, G, L, E? But E at 1 and E at 5? But position 5 is L? ""EAGLE"": E-A-G-L-E? Positions: 1-E, 2-A, 3-G, 4-L, 5-E. But L at position 4? But we know L is at position 5, so cannot be. Also, E at 5? But forbidden.

""EARLY"": E, A, R, L, Y? But R is forbidden.

""EATEN"": E, A, T, E, N? But T and N forbidden.

""EBOLA"": E, B, O, L, A? But L at 4, A at 5? We need L at 5, so A cannot be at 5? ""EBOLA"" ends with A? No, E-B-O-L-A. So L at 4? Not 5.

Thus, L must be last, so position 5 is L, so in ""EA_ _ L"", the blanks must be filled.

Words like ""EASEL"": E, A, S, E, L? S forbidden, and L at position 5? Structure: 1-E, 2-A, 3-S, 4-E, 5-L. Yes, but S forbidden.

Other words? Hard to find.

Now, subcase E at 4: pattern _ A _ E L

So position: 1: ?, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: L

And the first and third positions cannot be forbidden letters.

Examples: ""HALEL"" not word? ""VALID"": V, A, L, I, D? But L at 3? And E? Not present. We need E at position 4.

""VALET"": V, A, L, E, T? Positions: 1-V, 2-A, 3-L, 4-E, 5-T. But T forbidden, and we need L at 5? No.

""MANGE"": M, A, N, G, E? But N forbidden.

""PAPER"": P, A, P, E, R? R forbidden.

""BAKER"": B, A, K, E, R? R forbidden.

""MAKER"": M, A, K, E, R? R forbidden.

""HAVEL"": not common? ""CAVIL"": C forbidden.

""DAZED"": D, A, Z, E, D? D at 1 and 5? But L at 5? Not matching.

""WAVED"": W, A, V, E, D? Again, L at 5 not present.

But we need the word to end with L.

So: for pattern _ A _ E L: the fourth letter is E, fifth is L.

So, position 3 must be filled and position 1.

Examples: Here are some words: ""Hazel"": H, A, Z, E, L -> positions: 1-H, 2-A, 3-Z, 4-E, 5-L. Yes!

""Hazel"" is a valid English word.

But we have to check if H and Z are forbidden? Not forbidden yet.

Similarly, other words: ""Fabel"" not common. ""Label"": L, A, B, E, L -> but L at position 1? And L at 5? Also, E at 4.

Yes, ""label"": L, A, B, E, L.

But we already have L at 5, so that's fine.

Similarly, ""camel"": but C forbidden.

""model"": M, O, D, E, L? Pattern: 1-M, 2-O, 3-D, 4-E, 5-L -> not A at second position? We need A at position 2.

We need position 2 to be A, position 4 to be E, position 5 to be L.

So, words like:

- ""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> not common? But acceptable.
- ""LABEL"": L, A, B, E, L -> L at 1 and 5? This might work.
- ""JAVEL"" not a word.
- ""PAVEL"" name?
- ""RAVEL"": but R forbidden.
- ""SABEL"" not common, and S forbidden? S is forbidden.
- ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but T forbidden and L at 4 not 5? And E at 5? Not matching.
- ""MAPLE"": M A P L E -> L at position 4? Not 5.

So common words: ""HAZEL"" and ""LABEL"".

In ""LABEL"", L at position 1 and position 5. That is allowed, since L could be duplicated? But we know that L is in the word only at position 5? No, the feedback showed L at position 5 correct, but it might be in other positions? We don't have information about other positions.

In the second guess, we had L at 5 green, but that doesn't mean L isn't elsewhere.

Similarly, in ""LABEL"", if we guess it, and if L is only at 5, then position 1 L would be marked accordingly.

Similarly for ""HAZEL"".

Also, we have the possibility where A is at position 1? Earlier we struggled.

Another word: ""AGILE"": A G I L E? Pattern: A at 1, E at 5? E at 5 forbidden? We know E not at position 5.

""ALIVE"": A L I V E? E at 5 forbidden.

""EXCEL"": but C forbidden, S not? E X C E L? C forbidden.

Perhaps we missed some.

What about with A at position 2 and E at position 1? Earlier ""E A _ _ L""

Words: ""EALED"" not common. ""EQUAL"": E Q U A L? Positions: 1-E, 2-Q, 3-U, 4-A, 5-L. But A at 4? We need A at 2? No, that's not A at 2.

In this pattern, for E at 1 and A at 2, then positions 3 and 4 need letters.

Example: ""EAGLE"" ? But ends with E, not L.

""EARLY"" forbidden R.

There is ""EANED"" not word.

""MANED"" has M A N E D? Not L?

I think it's harder.

Therefore, the most plausible words are ""HAZEL"" and ""LABEL"".

But we need to maximize information. Also, we have more to test.

But since we have to guess, let's pick one that tests new letters.

In ""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L. We haven't tested H and Z.

In ""LABEL"": L, A, B, E, L. We haven't tested B, and L is already known at 5 but might be duplicated.

But in ""LABEL"", we have L at position 1, which is new.

Similarly, we know E is not at 3 or 5, but in ""HAZEL"" or ""LABEL"", E is at 4.

Now, also, we know A is not at 3 or 4, so in both, A is at 2? In ""HAZEL"" and ""LABEL"", A is at position 2.

Similarly, L at 5 is fixed.

Now, we also need to consider that in the first guess, E was at position 5 (forbidden) and in the second guess E was at 3 (forbidden). Now, in ""HAZEL"" or ""LABEL"", E is at position 4, which has not been tried, so possible.

Similarly, A is at position 2, which has not been tried (in first guess A at 3, in second A at 4, now at 2).

So, both are candidates.

But let's think if there is another word I missed.

""OVAL"" not 5.

Or ""IDEAL"": but I D E A L? Pattern: 1-I, 2-D, 3-E, 4-A, 5-L. But E at position 3 is forbidden? From second guess, we know E not at position 3. So ""IDEAL"" has E at 3, invalid.

Similarly, ""VIELA"" not word.

So, ""HAZEL"" and ""LABEL"" seem the main options.

We could guess ""LABEL"" to test if L is duplicated? But we don't know.

Another word: ""BADEL"" not common.

I think we should choose one.

Perhaps ""HAZEL"" because it uses less common letters and might reduce possibilities faster? Or ""LABEL"" to test L.

But let me observe that in ""steal"", we had L at 5 correct, so if we put L at 1 in ""label"", it might tell us if L is duplicated.

But we know E is at some wrong position? We don't know about duplication.

So, let's try ""label"".

But wait, we need to confirm if ""label"" is accepted Wordle word. I believe it is.

Similarly, ""hazel"".

But we have to avoid S,T, etc.

Now, from feedback, we have L fixed at 5, and we need A at 1 or 2, and E at 1,2, or4 but not3 or5.

In ""label"", A at 2, E at 4, L at 1 and 5. So if L is not duplicated, position 1 L will be marked wrong or absent.

Similarly, in ""hazel"", H and Z are new.

Perhaps ""label"" is a safer guess.

But let's think about case with A at position 1.

I found ""ABBEY"" no E? ""ABLED"": A, B, L, E, D, but L at pos3, not5.

""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U? E at pos4, L not present.

But we need L at 5.

""ADDLE"": A, D, D, L, E? But E at5 forbidden.

""AMPLE"" forbidden E at5.

So no 5-letter words with A at1 and L at5 and E at2 or4? For example, E at2: ""A E _ _ L"" -> ""Aegis"" not 5? ""Aerie"" not.

""aeled"" not word.

Or ""aeons"" forbidden.

So, A at position 1 doesn't seem to yield valid words. Therefore, A must be at position 2.

Thus, pattern _ A _ _ L, with E at position 1 or 4.

E at1: pattern E A _ _ L -> words like ""Eagle"" not, ""Easel"" forbidden.

""Eastern"" too long.

""early"" forbidden.

E at4: pattern _ A _ E L -> words like ""label"", ""hazel"", ""maple"" but maple no E? Maple: M A P L E, E at5 forbidden.

""ample"" similar.

So, indeed, ""label"" and ""hazel"".

Now, we can choose ""label"" as a guess.

But let's see if there is ""bagel"": B A G E L? Positions: B at1, A at2, G at3, E at4, L at5. Yes, ""bagel"" is a word.

Similarly, ""basel"" not common? ""vowel"" not A.

""jewel"" no A.

So ""bagel"" is another option: B, A, G, E, L.

With B, G tested.

Similarly, ""gavel"": G A V E L? But ""gavel"" is G A V E L, so position 1-G, 2-A, 3-V, 4-E, 5-L.

Also possible.

So, possible words: ""LABEL"", ""HAZEL"", ""BAGEL"", ""GAVEL"", etc.

We have several options.

But we must choose one for third guess.

To make progress, we should choose a word that tests letters we haven't tried and covers common possibilities.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, T.

We have tried A, E, L.

Unknown letters: let's pick common ones.

""B"" and ""G"" are common in ""BAGEL"".

"" H"" and ""Z"" in ""HAZEL"" are less common.

So to eliminate more, perhaps ""bagel"" is a good choice.

With ""bagel"", we test B and G.

Similarly, ""label"" tests L at position 1 and B.

But L is already known to be in the word at position 5, so duplicating might not give as much information? But it could.

I think ""bagel"" is a solid choice.

So, I'll go with ""bagel"".

But let's confirm the positions: ""BAGEL"" -> B at1, A at2, G at3, E at4, L at5.

Constraints:
- A is at position 2: which is new (previously tried at 3 and 4, not 2).
- E is at position 4: which was tried at 5 (not allowed) and at 3 (not allowed), now at 4, new position.
- L at 5, known correct.

So, if we get feedback, we can pin down if A at 2 or E at 4 is correct.

Similarly, B at 1 and G at 3 are new.

So, good for information.

Therefore, third guess: ""bagel""

In summary:
- From first guess: A and E in word, not at positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- From second guess: L at position 5 correct; E not at 3; A not at 4. Also S and T absent.
- Thus, A must be at 1 or 2, but words with A at 1 are scarce, so likely at 2. And E at 1 or 4.
- Guessing ""BAGEL"" to test A at 2 and E at 4, and letters B and G.

<guess>bagel</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

1. **First guess: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
   - This indicates that:
     - C, R, and N are not in the secret word.
     - A is in the word but not at position 3.
     - E is in the word but not at position 5.

2. **Second guess: ""steal""** → Feedback: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(✓)
   - This indicates that:
     - S and T are not in the secret word.
     - E is in the word but not at position 3.
     - A is in the word but not at position 4.
     - L is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.

### Key Inferences:
- **Confirmed letters and positions:** 
  - L is fixed at position 5 (from the ✓ in ""steal"").
- **Letters in the word (but wrong positions):** 
  - A is in the word, but cannot be at positions 3 (from ""crane"") or 4 (from ""steal""). Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 2.
  - E is in the word, but cannot be at positions 5 (from ""crane"") or 3 (from ""steal""). Therefore, E must be at position 1, 2, or 4 (position 5 is taken by L).
- **Absent letters:** C, R, N, S, T (eliminated).
- **Word structure:** The secret word ends with L (position 5). Given the constraints on A and E, the only feasible patterns are:
  - A at position 1: Pattern `A ? ? E L` (E at position 4) or `A E ? ? L` (E at position 2). However, common English words with A at position 1 and L at position 5 are rare when avoiding the forbidden letters.
  - A at position 2: Pattern `? A ? E L` (E at position 4) or `E A ? ? L` (E at position 1). Words like ""label"", ""hazel"", ""bagel"", or ""gavel"" fit, with E at position 4 being more common.

Given this, ""bagel"" is a strong guess:
- **Structure:** `B A G E L`, placing A at position 2 (new position to test) and E at position 4 (also new, avoiding previously invalid positions).
- **Benefits:** Tests new common consonants (B and G) while satisfying all known constraints. Consistent with English words and maximizes information gain by covering multiple possibilities:
  - If A or E is correctly placed, it quickly narrows the options.
  - Tests B and G for presence/absence, helping to refine future guesses.",Guess 3: bagel -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) G(-) E(✓) L(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 Let's go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters A and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 3 and 5 respectively).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains A and E, but not C, R, or N.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, or N (since they are absent).
- Includes A and E, but in different positions than the first guess (since in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and E at position 5, and they were marked as wrong position).
- Tries to include other common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for A and E:
- A was at position 3 in the first guess, so it cannot be at position 3 in the secret word. Therefore, A must be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- E was at position 5 in the first guess, so it cannot be at position 5. Therefore, E must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also want to use other common consonants. Since C, R, N are out, we can try letters like S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

Let's think of words that have A and E, and avoid C, R, N.

One common starting word is ""SLATE"", but let's check:
- S, L, A, T, E.
- We know A and E are in the word, so that's good.

But note: in ""SLATE"", A is at position 3 and E at position 5. However, in our first guess ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning A is not at position 3 in the secret word. Similarly, E was at position 5 and marked wrong, so E is not at position 5.

Therefore, if we use ""SLATE"", we would be putting A at position 3 again (which we know is incorrect) and E at position 5 (which we know is incorrect). That might not be the best use because we already know those positions are wrong.

We should try to put A and E in new positions.

For example, we could try a word with A at position 1 and E at position 2? But that might not be common.

Alternatively, we can try to put A at position 1 and E at position 4? Or A at position 4 and E at position 2, etc.

Let's list some words that contain A and E, without C, R, N.

Possible words:
- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A at position 2, E at position 5. But E at position 5 is the same as before? We know E is not at position 5, so that would be a waste. Also, we don't know about U.

- ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T -> E at position 2, A at position 3. But A at position 3 is the same as the first guess and we know it's not there. So that would be bad.

- ""TALES"": T, A, L, E, S -> A at position 2, E at position 4. This seems better because A is not at 3 and E is not at 5.

But note: we also want to test other letters. We have only used A and E so far, and we know the word has at least two letters: A and E.

Another idea: ""STALE"" -> S, T, A, L, E -> A at position 3 (again, same as before) and E at position 5 (same as before). Not good.

We need to avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.

Let me try to find a word with A and E, without C, R, N, and with A not at 3 and E not at 5.

Consider:
- ""ADIEU"": This has A at 1, D, I, E at 4, U. But we don't know about I, D, U. Also, it has two vowels and might not be the best for getting consonant information.

- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at 3 (bad) and E at 5 (bad).

- ""LATTE"": L, A, T, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 is bad.

- ""TASTE"": T, A, S, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. Again, E at 5 is bad.

It's challenging to avoid position 5 for E. Maybe we can put E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

How about ""EAGLE""? But it has G and L, and A at 2, E at 1. But we don't know about G and L. Also, note that ""EAGLE"" has E at position 1 and A at position 2. That's new.

But wait, we also have to avoid R and N? ""EAGLE"" doesn't have R or N, so that's okay.

But let me check: E at position 1? We don't know if that's allowed. Similarly, A at position 2.

Another word: ""BEADS"": B, E, A, D, S -> E at 1, A at 3. But A at 3 is the same as before? We know A is not at 3, so that would be bad.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

So, for A, positions allowed: 1, 2, 4, 5.
For E, positions allowed: 1, 2, 3, 4.

So, we can try:
- A at 1: words like ""ABYSS"", but that has Y and S, and no E? We need E.

- A at 1 and E at 2: ""AEGIS"" (but not common), ""AESIR"" (not common).

- A at 1 and E at 3: ""ALIKE"" -> A at 1, E at 5? No, E is at 5? We cannot have E at 5.

""ALIKE"": A at 1, L, I, K, E at 5 -> E at 5 is bad.

- A at 1 and E at 4: ""ADIEU"" (as before) or ""AGLEE"" (not common).

- A at 2 and E at 1: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, A at 2, R? But R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word because in the first guess R was at position 2 and marked x (not in the word). So we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, so ""EARLY"" is invalid.

Similarly, we cannot use any word with R.

So, let's think of words without C, R, N, and with A and E in new positions.

Another idea: ""SALET"" (a word in word lists) -> S, A, L, E, T. But in this, A is at position 2? Let's see: 
Position 1: S, 2: A, 3: L, 4: E, 5: T.
So A at 2 (new position) and E at 4 (new position, not 5). This seems good.

But wait, in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and now we are putting A at position 2. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 4.

Also, we are testing S, L, T.

So, ""SALET"" is a valid word? I think it is (a variant of sallet, but accepted in Wordle).

Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but rearrange? But we can't rearrange arbitrarily.

Another common word: ""STALE"" has A at 3 and E at 5, which we want to avoid.

So, ""SALET"" seems a good choice.

But let me confirm the positions:
- S at 1
- A at 2
- L at 3
- E at 4
- T at 5

We know E cannot be at 5, but in this word E is at 4, so that's fine. And A is at 2, not 3, so also fine.

We are testing S, A, L, E, T. We don't know about S, L, T.

So, I think ""SALET"" is a good second guess.

But note: we are also trying to get information about the positions of A and E. Since we know A is in the word but not at position 3, and we are putting it at 2, if it turns out to be correct, we get a green. Similarly, E is not at 5, and we put it at 4.

Alternatively, we could try a word that puts A at position 4 or 5? But that might be less common.

Another word: ""LEAPT"" -> L, E, A, P, T. But E at 1, A at 3. We know A is not at 3, so that would be bad.

""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 is bad.

""TAPES"": T, A, P, E, S -> A at 2, E at 4. This is good: A at 2, E at 4. And letters T, P, S.

But ""TAPES"" is a word.

Similarly, ""PATES"": P, A, T, E, S -> same as above.

I think ""SALET"" or ""TAPES"" are both reasonable.

But let's consider that we also want to cover more common letters. S, T, L are very common.

I think ""SALET"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, we can use ""AISLE"": A at 1, I, S, L, E at 5. But E at 5 is bad because we know E is not at 5.

So avoid that.

""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 bad.

So, I think ""SALET"" is a good option.

But wait, in ""SALET"", the E is at position 4. We don't know if that's the correct position or not, but at least it's not 5.

Similarly, A at 2.

We might also consider ""STEAL"": S, T, E, A, L -> E at 3, A at 5. This avoids the known bad positions: A was at 3 and now at 5 (which is new), E was at 5 and now at 3 (which is new). So that's also good.

""STEAL"": positions: 1-S, 2-T, 3-E, 4-A, 5-L.

So A is at 4 (not 3) and E is at 3 (not 5). That's acceptable.

And we test S, T, E, A, L.

I think ""STEAL"" is also a good option.

Between ""SALET"" and ""STEAL"", which one? They have the same letters: S, T, E, A, L.

But in ""SALET"", the order is S, A, L, E, T.
In ""STEAL"", the order is S, T, E, A, L.

We don't have any information about S, T, L, so both are equally good.

I'll go with ""STEAL"" because it's a more common word.

But note: in ""STEAL"", we are putting E at position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Similarly, A at position 4.

So, let's choose ""STEAL"".

But wait, we must make sure we don't use any forbidden letters. ""STEAL"" has S, T, E, A, L. No C, R, N. Good.

So, second guess: ""STEAL""

But let me double-check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was wrong position, so A is not at 3. In ""STEAL"", A is at 4, so that's a new position. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 3, which is new.

Yes.

Alternatively, we could use a word that has a different set of consonants to cover more ground, but I think S, T, L are good.

So, I'll go with ""STEAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A cannot be at position 3, and E cannot be at position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include A and E (since they are in the secret word), but in new positions (A not at position 3, E not at position 5).
- The word must exclude C, R, and N (as they are absent from the secret word).
- To maximize information, use common letters like S, T, and L, which haven't been tested yet.

The word ""STEAL"" meets these criteria:
- Contains A (at position 4, avoiding position 3) and E (at position 3, avoiding position 5).
- Excludes C, R, and N.
- Tests new common consonants (S, T, L) and vowels (A, E) in different positions.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and E while providing information on S, T, and L.

<guess>steal</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess: ""crane""
   - C: x (C not in the word)
   - R: x (R not in the word)
   - A: - (A is in the word, but not at position 3)
   - N: x (N not in the word)
   - E: - (E is in the word, but not at position 5)

2. Second guess: ""steal""
   - S: x (S not in the word)
   - T: x (T not in the word)
   - E: - (E is in the word, but not at position 3; since in ""steal"", E is at position 3)
   - A: - (A is in the word, but not at position 4; since in ""steal"", A is at position 4)
   - L: ✓ (L is in the word and at the correct position, which is position 5? Wait, in ""steal"", L is at position 5)

Let's clarify the positions in ""steal"":
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: L

Feedback for ""steal"":
- S (pos1): x -> S not in the word
- T (pos2): x -> T not in the word
- E (pos3): - -> E is in the word but not at position 3
- A (pos4): - -> A is in the word but not at position 4
- L (pos5): ✓ -> L is in the word and at position 5

So, from this we know:
- The secret word has L at the last position (position 5).
- The word contains E and A, but E is not at position 3, and A is not at position 4.
- Also, E is not at position 5 (from first guess) and now we know E not at 3. Similarly, A not at 3 (from first guess) and now not at 4.
- Moreover, S and T are not in the word.

Additionally, from the first guess we know C, R, N are not in the word.

So, absent letters: C, R, N, S, T.
Present letters: A, E, L (with L fixed at position 5).

We also know that E and A must be in positions other than those already tried.

Possible positions for A and E:
- The word has 5 positions. Position 5 is taken by L.
- Positions available: 1, 2, 3, 4.

But constraints:
- A cannot be at positions 3 or 4 (from guesses: not at 3 in first, not at 4 in second).
- So A must be at position 1 or 2.

Similarly, E cannot be at positions 5 (from first guess) or 3 (from second guess). Also, E is in the word, so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4.

Now, we need to think of words that:
- End with L (position 5).
- Contain A and E.
- A is at position 1 or 2.
- E is at position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3 or 5).
- Exclude C, R, N, S, T.

Also, we have used all 6 tries? No, we have used 2, so 4 left.

Now, let's consider combinations:

Case 1: A at position 1.
Then the word starts with A, ends with L. So pattern: A _ _ _ L.

Now, E must be at position 2 or 4 (since cannot be at 1? Wait, E can be at position 1? But if A is at position 1, then E cannot be at 1. So for E, positions available: 2 and 4.

Similarly, if A is at position 1, then position 1 is taken by A, so E cannot be at 1. Therefore, E must be at 2 or 4.

Now, the word has two more letters? Actually, it must have A, E, and L, and two more letters. But we have only three known to be in the word: A, E, L. However, the word might have more letters, or duplicated? But so far we haven't seen duplicates.

But we don't know if there are duplicates. However, since we got only one green and two yellows so far, and the word might have 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily.

But let's proceed without duplication assumption unless forced.

So, pattern: A _ _ _ L, with E at position 2 or 4.

Also, the unknown positions (if E at 2, then positions 3 and 4; if E at 4, then positions 2 and 3) must be filled with letters not forbidden.

Forbidden letters: C, R, N, S, T.

Available letters: all others except A, E, L and forbidden? But we don't know what else.

Common letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, Case 2: A at position 2.
Then word pattern: _ A _ _ L, with E at position 1, 2, or 4. But position 2 is A, so E cannot be at 2. Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 4.

So:
- Subcase 2a: E at 1 -> E A _ _ L
- Subcase 2b: E at 4 -> _ A _ E L

We need to consider all possibilities and think of words.

Given we are making the third guess, we want to test multiple possibilities at once.

We also know that E cannot be at position 3 or 5. And A cannot be at 3 or 4.

First, let me try to list possible words.

Possible words with L at end and A and E present:

- With A at 1: ""ABEL?"" not a word. ""ADEL"", but not common. ""AISLE"": A at 1, I, S, L, E at 5? But E at 5 is already forbidden? Also, S is forbidden now. ""AISLE"" has S? Yes, and S is not in word. So no.

Other words: ""ALIKE"": A at 1, L at 2, but then L at 2 and 5? And E at 5, which is forbidden.

""AMPLE"": A at 1, M, P, L, E at 5? But E at 5 forbidden.

""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E? But E at 5 forbidden.

So, for A at position 1, we need E at position 2 or 4.

With E position 2: word pattern: A E ? ? L

What words? ""AEGIS"" not 5 letters? ""AEONS"" but has S and N? Not allowed.

""AEONS"" has N and S, forbidden.

Not coming up with many. Let's think: ""ANGEL"" but has N, forbidden.

Perhaps ""AVIEW"" not a word.

Maybe A at 1 is not common? But we must try.

With E at position 4: pattern A ? ? E L

Examples: ""AUDEL"" not a word? ""AXEL"": A, X, E, L? But that's only 4? ""AXLE"" is a word: A, X, L, E. But that's 4 letters. No, ""axle"" is 4 letters. We need 5. So ""APPEL"": A, P, P, E, L? That's 5: A-P-P-E-L. But E at position 4? And L at 5. E is at position 4? Position: 1-A, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E, 5-L.

Yes, ""APPEL"" is a word. But it has double P? And we don't know about P.

Similarly, ""AMEL"" not 5.

Another idea: ""ABLED"": but has B,L,E,D, but structure: A,B,L,E,D? Not A? Position 1:A, 2:B, 3:L, 4:E, 5:D? But L is at position 3, and we need L at 5? No. L must be at 5. So the word ends with L, so last letter L.

So pattern for A? and E? with L last.

With A at 1 and E at 4: e.g., ""ANVIL""? But N forbidden. ""AWEEL"" not word.

Perhaps no common words? Try case 2.

Case 2: A at position 2.

Then pattern: _ A _ _ L

And E at position 1 or 4.

First, E at position 1: pattern E A _ _ L

Words: ""EAGLE"": E, A, G, L, E? But E at 1 and E at 5? But position 5 is L? ""EAGLE"": E-A-G-L-E? Positions: 1-E, 2-A, 3-G, 4-L, 5-E. But L at position 4? But we know L is at position 5, so cannot be. Also, E at 5? But forbidden.

""EARLY"": E, A, R, L, Y? But R is forbidden.

""EATEN"": E, A, T, E, N? But T and N forbidden.

""EBOLA"": E, B, O, L, A? But L at 4, A at 5? We need L at 5, so A cannot be at 5? ""EBOLA"" ends with A? No, E-B-O-L-A. So L at 4? Not 5.

Thus, L must be last, so position 5 is L, so in ""EA_ _ L"", the blanks must be filled.

Words like ""EASEL"": E, A, S, E, L? S forbidden, and L at position 5? Structure: 1-E, 2-A, 3-S, 4-E, 5-L. Yes, but S forbidden.

Other words? Hard to find.

Now, subcase E at 4: pattern _ A _ E L

So position: 1: ?, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: L

And the first and third positions cannot be forbidden letters.

Examples: ""HALEL"" not word? ""VALID"": V, A, L, I, D? But L at 3? And E? Not present. We need E at position 4.

""VALET"": V, A, L, E, T? Positions: 1-V, 2-A, 3-L, 4-E, 5-T. But T forbidden, and we need L at 5? No.

""MANGE"": M, A, N, G, E? But N forbidden.

""PAPER"": P, A, P, E, R? R forbidden.

""BAKER"": B, A, K, E, R? R forbidden.

""MAKER"": M, A, K, E, R? R forbidden.

""HAVEL"": not common? ""CAVIL"": C forbidden.

""DAZED"": D, A, Z, E, D? D at 1 and 5? But L at 5? Not matching.

""WAVED"": W, A, V, E, D? Again, L at 5 not present.

But we need the word to end with L.

So: for pattern _ A _ E L: the fourth letter is E, fifth is L.

So, position 3 must be filled and position 1.

Examples: Here are some words: ""Hazel"": H, A, Z, E, L -> positions: 1-H, 2-A, 3-Z, 4-E, 5-L. Yes!

""Hazel"" is a valid English word.

But we have to check if H and Z are forbidden? Not forbidden yet.

Similarly, other words: ""Fabel"" not common. ""Label"": L, A, B, E, L -> but L at position 1? And L at 5? Also, E at 4.

Yes, ""label"": L, A, B, E, L.

But we already have L at 5, so that's fine.

Similarly, ""camel"": but C forbidden.

""model"": M, O, D, E, L? Pattern: 1-M, 2-O, 3-D, 4-E, 5-L -> not A at second position? We need A at position 2.

We need position 2 to be A, position 4 to be E, position 5 to be L.

So, words like:

- ""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> not common? But acceptable.
- ""LABEL"": L, A, B, E, L -> L at 1 and 5? This might work.
- ""JAVEL"" not a word.
- ""PAVEL"" name?
- ""RAVEL"": but R forbidden.
- ""SABEL"" not common, and S forbidden? S is forbidden.
- ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but T forbidden and L at 4 not 5? And E at 5? Not matching.
- ""MAPLE"": M A P L E -> L at position 4? Not 5.

So common words: ""HAZEL"" and ""LABEL"".

In ""LABEL"", L at position 1 and position 5. That is allowed, since L could be duplicated? But we know that L is in the word only at position 5? No, the feedback showed L at position 5 correct, but it might be in other positions? We don't have information about other positions.

In the second guess, we had L at 5 green, but that doesn't mean L isn't elsewhere.

Similarly, in ""LABEL"", if we guess it, and if L is only at 5, then position 1 L would be marked accordingly.

Similarly for ""HAZEL"".

Also, we have the possibility where A is at position 1? Earlier we struggled.

Another word: ""AGILE"": A G I L E? Pattern: A at 1, E at 5? E at 5 forbidden? We know E not at position 5.

""ALIVE"": A L I V E? E at 5 forbidden.

""EXCEL"": but C forbidden, S not? E X C E L? C forbidden.

Perhaps we missed some.

What about with A at position 2 and E at position 1? Earlier ""E A _ _ L""

Words: ""EALED"" not common. ""EQUAL"": E Q U A L? Positions: 1-E, 2-Q, 3-U, 4-A, 5-L. But A at 4? We need A at 2? No, that's not A at 2.

In this pattern, for E at 1 and A at 2, then positions 3 and 4 need letters.

Example: ""EAGLE"" ? But ends with E, not L.

""EARLY"" forbidden R.

There is ""EANED"" not word.

""MANED"" has M A N E D? Not L?

I think it's harder.

Therefore, the most plausible words are ""HAZEL"" and ""LABEL"".

But we need to maximize information. Also, we have more to test.

But since we have to guess, let's pick one that tests new letters.

In ""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L. We haven't tested H and Z.

In ""LABEL"": L, A, B, E, L. We haven't tested B, and L is already known at 5 but might be duplicated.

But in ""LABEL"", we have L at position 1, which is new.

Similarly, we know E is not at 3 or 5, but in ""HAZEL"" or ""LABEL"", E is at 4.

Now, also, we know A is not at 3 or 4, so in both, A is at 2? In ""HAZEL"" and ""LABEL"", A is at position 2.

Similarly, L at 5 is fixed.

Now, we also need to consider that in the first guess, E was at position 5 (forbidden) and in the second guess E was at 3 (forbidden). Now, in ""HAZEL"" or ""LABEL"", E is at position 4, which has not been tried, so possible.

Similarly, A is at position 2, which has not been tried (in first guess A at 3, in second A at 4, now at 2).

So, both are candidates.

But let's think if there is another word I missed.

""OVAL"" not 5.

Or ""IDEAL"": but I D E A L? Pattern: 1-I, 2-D, 3-E, 4-A, 5-L. But E at position 3 is forbidden? From second guess, we know E not at position 3. So ""IDEAL"" has E at 3, invalid.

Similarly, ""VIELA"" not word.

So, ""HAZEL"" and ""LABEL"" seem the main options.

We could guess ""LABEL"" to test if L is duplicated? But we don't know.

Another word: ""BADEL"" not common.

I think we should choose one.

Perhaps ""HAZEL"" because it uses less common letters and might reduce possibilities faster? Or ""LABEL"" to test L.

But let me observe that in ""steal"", we had L at 5 correct, so if we put L at 1 in ""label"", it might tell us if L is duplicated.

But we know E is at some wrong position? We don't know about duplication.

So, let's try ""label"".

But wait, we need to confirm if ""label"" is accepted Wordle word. I believe it is.

Similarly, ""hazel"".

But we have to avoid S,T, etc.

Now, from feedback, we have L fixed at 5, and we need A at 1 or 2, and E at 1,2, or4 but not3 or5.

In ""label"", A at 2, E at 4, L at 1 and 5. So if L is not duplicated, position 1 L will be marked wrong or absent.

Similarly, in ""hazel"", H and Z are new.

Perhaps ""label"" is a safer guess.

But let's think about case with A at position 1.

I found ""ABBEY"" no E? ""ABLED"": A, B, L, E, D, but L at pos3, not5.

""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U? E at pos4, L not present.

But we need L at 5.

""ADDLE"": A, D, D, L, E? But E at5 forbidden.

""AMPLE"" forbidden E at5.

So no 5-letter words with A at1 and L at5 and E at2 or4? For example, E at2: ""A E _ _ L"" -> ""Aegis"" not 5? ""Aerie"" not.

""aeled"" not word.

Or ""aeons"" forbidden.

So, A at position 1 doesn't seem to yield valid words. Therefore, A must be at position 2.

Thus, pattern _ A _ _ L, with E at position 1 or 4.

E at1: pattern E A _ _ L -> words like ""Eagle"" not, ""Easel"" forbidden.

""Eastern"" too long.

""early"" forbidden.

E at4: pattern _ A _ E L -> words like ""label"", ""hazel"", ""maple"" but maple no E? Maple: M A P L E, E at5 forbidden.

""ample"" similar.

So, indeed, ""label"" and ""hazel"".

Now, we can choose ""label"" as a guess.

But let's see if there is ""bagel"": B A G E L? Positions: B at1, A at2, G at3, E at4, L at5. Yes, ""bagel"" is a word.

Similarly, ""basel"" not common? ""vowel"" not A.

""jewel"" no A.

So ""bagel"" is another option: B, A, G, E, L.

With B, G tested.

Similarly, ""gavel"": G A V E L? But ""gavel"" is G A V E L, so position 1-G, 2-A, 3-V, 4-E, 5-L.

Also possible.

So, possible words: ""LABEL"", ""HAZEL"", ""BAGEL"", ""GAVEL"", etc.

We have several options.

But we must choose one for third guess.

To make progress, we should choose a word that tests letters we haven't tried and covers common possibilities.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, T.

We have tried A, E, L.

Unknown letters: let's pick common ones.

""B"" and ""G"" are common in ""BAGEL"".

"" H"" and ""Z"" in ""HAZEL"" are less common.

So to eliminate more, perhaps ""bagel"" is a good choice.

With ""bagel"", we test B and G.

Similarly, ""label"" tests L at position 1 and B.

But L is already known to be in the word at position 5, so duplicating might not give as much information? But it could.

I think ""bagel"" is a solid choice.

So, I'll go with ""bagel"".

But let's confirm the positions: ""BAGEL"" -> B at1, A at2, G at3, E at4, L at5.

Constraints:
- A is at position 2: which is new (previously tried at 3 and 4, not 2).
- E is at position 4: which was tried at 5 (not allowed) and at 3 (not allowed), now at 4, new position.
- L at 5, known correct.

So, if we get feedback, we can pin down if A at 2 or E at 4 is correct.

Similarly, B at 1 and G at 3 are new.

So, good for information.

Therefore, third guess: ""bagel""

In summary:
- From first guess: A and E in word, not at positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- From second guess: L at position 5 correct; E not at 3; A not at 4. Also S and T absent.
- Thus, A must be at 1 or 2, but words with A at 1 are scarce, so likely at 2. And E at 1 or 4.
- Guessing ""BAGEL"" to test A at 2 and E at 4, and letters B and G.

<guess>bagel</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

1. **First guess: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
   - This indicates that:
     - C, R, and N are not in the secret word.
     - A is in the word but not at position 3.
     - E is in the word but not at position 5.

2. **Second guess: ""steal""** → Feedback: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(✓)
   - This indicates that:
     - S and T are not in the secret word.
     - E is in the word but not at position 3.
     - A is in the word but not at position 4.
     - L is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.

### Key Inferences:
- **Confirmed letters and positions:** 
  - L is fixed at position 5 (from the ✓ in ""steal"").
- **Letters in the word (but wrong positions):** 
  - A is in the word, but cannot be at positions 3 (from ""crane"") or 4 (from ""steal""). Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 2.
  - E is in the word, but cannot be at positions 5 (from ""crane"") or 3 (from ""steal""). Therefore, E must be at position 1, 2, or 4 (position 5 is taken by L).
- **Absent letters:** C, R, N, S, T (eliminated).
- **Word structure:** The secret word ends with L (position 5). Given the constraints on A and E, the only feasible patterns are:
  - A at position 1: Pattern `A ? ? E L` (E at position 4) or `A E ? ? L` (E at position 2). However, common English words with A at position 1 and L at position 5 are rare when avoiding the forbidden letters.
  - A at position 2: Pattern `? A ? E L` (E at position 4) or `E A ? ? L` (E at position 1). Words like ""label"", ""hazel"", ""bagel"", or ""gavel"" fit, with E at position 4 being more common.

Given this, ""bagel"" is a strong guess:
- **Structure:** `B A G E L`, placing A at position 2 (new position to test) and E at position 4 (also new, avoiding previously invalid positions).
- **Benefits:** Tests new common consonants (B and G) while satisfying all known constraints. Consistent with English words and maximizes information gain by covering multiple possibilities:
  - If A or E is correctly placed, it quickly narrows the options.
  - Tests B and G for presence/absence, helping to refine future guesses.

Therefore, A must be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n- E was at position 5 in the first guess, so it cannot be at position 5. Therefore, E must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe also want to use other common consonants. Since C, R, N are out, we can try letters like S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A and E, and avoid C, R, N.\n\nOne common starting word is ""SLATE"", but let\'s check:\n- S, L, A, T, E.\n- We know A and E are in the word, so that\'s good.\n\nBut note: in ""SLATE"", A is at position 3 and E at position 5. However, in our first guess ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning A is not at position 3 in the secret word. Similarly, E was at position 5 and marked wrong, so E is not at position 5.\n\nTherefore, if we use ""SLATE"", we would be putting A at position 3 again (which we know is incorrect) and E at position 5 (which we know is incorrect). That might not be the best use because we already know those positions are wrong.\n\nWe should try to put A and E in new positions.\n\nFor example, we could try a word with A at position 1 and E at position 2? But that might not be common.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put A at position 1 and E at position 4? Or A at position 4 and E at position 2, etc.\n\nLet\'s list some words that contain A and E, without C, R, N.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> A at position 2, E at position 5. But E at position 5 is the same as before? We know E is not at position 5, so that would be a waste. Also, we don\'t know about U.\n\n- ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T -> E at position 2, A at position 3. But A at position 3 is the same as the first guess and we know it\'s not there. So that would be bad.\n\n- ""TALES"": T, A, L, E, S -> A at position 2, E at position 4. This seems better because A is not at 3 and E is not at 5.\n\nBut note: we also want to test other letters. We have only used A and E so far, and we know the word has at least two letters: A and E.\n\nAnother idea: ""STALE"" -> S, T, A, L, E -> A at position 3 (again, same as before) and E at position 5 (same as before). Not good.\n\nWe need to avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.\n\nLet me try to find a word with A and E, without C, R, N, and with A not at 3 and E not at 5.\n\nConsider:\n- ""ADIEU"": This has A at 1, D, I, E at 4, U. But we don\'t know about I, D, U. Also, it has two vowels and might not be the best for getting consonant information.\n\n- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at 3 (bad) and E at 5 (bad).\n\n- ""LATTE"": L, A, T, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 is bad.\n\n- ""TASTE"": T, A, S, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. Again, E at 5 is bad.\n\nIt\'s challenging to avoid position 5 for E. Maybe we can put E at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nHow about ""EAGLE""? But it has G and L, and A at 2, E at 1. But we don\'t know about G and L. Also, note that ""EAGLE"" has E at position 1 and A at position 2. That\'s new.\n\nBut wait, we also have to avoid R and N? ""EAGLE"" doesn\'t have R or N, so that\'s okay.\n\nBut let me check: E at position 1? We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. Similarly, A at position 2.\n\nAnother word: ""BEADS"": B, E, A, D, S -> E at 1, A at 3. But A at 3 is the same as before? We know A is not at 3, so that would be bad.\n\nWe need to avoid position 3 for A.\n\nSo, for A, positions allowed: 1, 2, 4, 5.\nFor E, positions allowed: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nSo, we can try:\n- A at 1: words like ""ABYSS"", but that has Y and S, and no E? We need E.\n\n- A at 1 and E at 2: ""AEGIS"" (but not common), ""AESIR"" (not common).\n\n- A at 1 and E at 3: ""ALIKE"" -> A at 1, E at 5? No, E is at 5? We cannot have E at 5.\n\n""ALIKE"": A at 1, L, I, K, E at 5 -> E at 5 is bad.\n\n- A at 1 and E at 4: ""ADIEU"" (as before) or ""AGLEE"" (not common).\n\n- A at 2 and E at 1: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, A at 2, R? But R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word because in the first guess R was at position 2 and marked x (not in the word). So we cannot use R.\n\nWe must avoid R, so ""EARLY"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use any word with R.\n\nSo, let\'s think of words without C, R, N, and with A and E in new positions.\n\nAnother idea: ""SALET"" (a word in word lists) -> S, A, L, E, T. But in this, A is at position 2? Let\'s see: \nPosition 1: S, 2: A, 3: L, 4: E, 5: T.\nSo A at 2 (new position) and E at 4 (new position, not 5). This seems good.\n\nBut wait, in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and now we are putting A at position 2. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 4.\n\nAlso, we are testing S, L, T.\n\nSo, ""SALET"" is a valid word? I think it is (a variant of sallet, but accepted in Wordle).\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but rearrange? But we can\'t rearrange arbitrarily.\n\nAnother common word: ""STALE"" has A at 3 and E at 5, which we want to avoid.\n\nSo, ""SALET"" seems a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm the positions:\n- S at 1\n- A at 2\n- L at 3\n- E at 4\n- T at 5\n\nWe know E cannot be at 5, but in this word E is at 4, so that\'s fine. And A is at 2, not 3, so also fine.\n\nWe are testing S, A, L, E, T. We don\'t know about S, L, T.\n\nSo, I think ""SALET"" is a good second guess.\n\nBut note: we are also trying to get information about the positions of A and E. Since we know A is in the word but not at position 3, and we are putting it at 2, if it turns out to be correct, we get a green. Similarly, E is not at 5, and we put it at 4.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that puts A at position 4 or 5? But that might be less common.\n\nAnother word: ""LEAPT"" -> L, E, A, P, T. But E at 1, A at 3. We know A is not at 3, so that would be bad.\n\n""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 is bad.\n\n""TAPES"": T, A, P, E, S -> A at 2, E at 4. This is good: A at 2, E at 4. And letters T, P, S.\n\nBut ""TAPES"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""PATES"": P, A, T, E, S -> same as above.\n\nI think ""SALET"" or ""TAPES"" are both reasonable.\n\nBut let\'s consider that we also want to cover more common letters. S, T, L are very common.\n\nI think ""SALET"" is a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""AISLE"": A at 1, I, S, L, E at 5. But E at 5 is bad because we know E is not at 5.\n\nSo avoid that.\n\n""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E -> A at 2, E at 5. E at 5 bad.\n\nSo, I think ""SALET"" is a good option.\n\nBut wait, in ""SALET"", the E is at position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s the correct position or not, but at least it\'s not 5.\n\nSimilarly, A at 2.\n\nWe might also consider ""STEAL"": S, T, E, A, L -> E at 3, A at 5. This avoids the known bad positions: A was at 3 and now at 5 (which is new), E was at 5 and now at 3 (which is new). So that\'s also good.\n\n""STEAL"": positions: 1-S, 2-T, 3-E, 4-A, 5-L.\n\nSo A is at 4 (not 3) and E is at 3 (not 5). That\'s acceptable.\n\nAnd we test S, T, E, A, L.\n\nI think ""STEAL"" is also a good option.\n\nBetween ""SALET"" and ""STEAL"", which one? They have the same letters: S, T, E, A, L.\n\nBut in ""SALET"", the order is S, A, L, E, T.\nIn ""STEAL"", the order is S, T, E, A, L.\n\nWe don\'t have any information about S, T, L, so both are equally good.\n\nI\'ll go with ""STEAL"" because it\'s a more common word.\n\nBut note: in ""STEAL"", we are putting E at position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\nSimilarly, A at position 4.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""STEAL"".\n\nBut wait, we must make sure we don\'t use any forbidden letters. ""STEAL"" has S, T, E, A, L. No C, R, N. Good.\n\nSo, second guess: ""STEAL""\n\nBut let me double-check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was wrong position, so A is not at 3. In ""STEAL"", A is at 4, so that\'s a new position. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 3, which is new.\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word that has a different set of consonants to cover more ground, but I think S, T, L are good.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""STEAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and N are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- A and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A cannot be at position 3, and E cannot be at position 5.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include A and E (since they are in the secret word), but in new positions (A not at position 3, E not at position 5).\n- The word must exclude C, R, and N (as they are absent from the secret word).\n- To maximize information, use common letters like S, T, and L, which haven\'t been tested yet.\n\nThe word ""STEAL"" meets these criteria:\n- Contains A (at position 4, avoiding position 3) and E (at position 3, avoiding position 5).\n- Excludes C, R, and N.\n- Tests new common consonants (S, T, L) and vowels (A, E) in different positions.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of A and E while providing information on S, T, and L.\n\n<guess>steal</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. First guess: ""crane""\n   - C: x (C not in the word)\n   - R: x (R not in the word)\n   - A: - (A is in the word, but not at position 3)\n   - N: x (N not in the word)\n   - E: - (E is in the word, but not at position 5)\n\n2. Second guess: ""steal""\n   - S: x (S not in the word)\n   - T: x (T not in the word)\n   - E: - (E is in the word, but not at position 3; since in ""steal"", E is at position 3)\n   - A: - (A is in the word, but not at position 4; since in ""steal"", A is at position 4)\n   - L: ✓ (L is in the word and at the correct position, which is position 5? Wait, in ""steal"", L is at position 5)\n\nLet\'s clarify the positions in ""steal"":\n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: T\n- Position 3: E\n- Position 4: A\n- Position 5: L\n\nFeedback for ""steal"":\n- S (pos1): x -> S not in the word\n- T (pos2): x -> T not in the word\n- E (pos3): - -> E is in the word but not at position 3\n- A (pos4): - -> A is in the word but not at position 4\n- L (pos5): ✓ -> L is in the word and at position 5\n\nSo, from this we know:\n- The secret word has L at the last position (position 5).\n- The word contains E and A, but E is not at position 3, and A is not at position 4.\n- Also, E is not at position 5 (from first guess) and now we know E not at 3. Similarly, A not at 3 (from first guess) and now not at 4.\n- Moreover, S and T are not in the word.\n\nAdditionally, from the first guess we know C, R, N are not in the word.\n\nSo, absent letters: C, R, N, S, T.\nPresent letters: A, E, L (with L fixed at position 5).\n\nWe also know that E and A must be in positions other than those already tried.\n\nPossible positions for A and E:\n- The word has 5 positions. Position 5 is taken by L.\n- Positions available: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nBut constraints:\n- A cannot be at positions 3 or 4 (from guesses: not at 3 in first, not at 4 in second).\n- So A must be at position 1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly, E cannot be at positions 5 (from first guess) or 3 (from second guess). Also, E is in the word, so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nNow, we need to think of words that:\n- End with L (position 5).\n- Contain A and E.\n- A is at position 1 or 2.\n- E is at position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3 or 5).\n- Exclude C, R, N, S, T.\n\nAlso, we have used all 6 tries? No, we have used 2, so 4 left.\n\nNow, let\'s consider combinations:\n\nCase 1: A at position 1.\nThen the word starts with A, ends with L. So pattern: A _ _ _ L.\n\nNow, E must be at position 2 or 4 (since cannot be at 1? Wait, E can be at position 1? But if A is at position 1, then E cannot be at 1. So for E, positions available: 2 and 4.\n\nSimilarly, if A is at position 1, then position 1 is taken by A, so E cannot be at 1. Therefore, E must be at 2 or 4.\n\nNow, the word has two more letters? Actually, it must have A, E, and L, and two more letters. But we have only three known to be in the word: A, E, L. However, the word might have more letters, or duplicated? But so far we haven\'t seen duplicates.\n\nBut we don\'t know if there are duplicates. However, since we got only one green and two yellows so far, and the word might have 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily.\n\nBut let\'s proceed without duplication assumption unless forced.\n\nSo, pattern: A _ _ _ L, with E at position 2 or 4.\n\nAlso, the unknown positions (if E at 2, then positions 3 and 4; if E at 4, then positions 2 and 3) must be filled with letters not forbidden.\n\nForbidden letters: C, R, N, S, T.\n\nAvailable letters: all others except A, E, L and forbidden? But we don\'t know what else.\n\nCommon letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nNow, Case 2: A at position 2.\nThen word pattern: _ A _ _ L, with E at position 1, 2, or 4. But position 2 is A, so E cannot be at 2. Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 4.\n\nSo:\n- Subcase 2a: E at 1 -> E A _ _ L\n- Subcase 2b: E at 4 -> _ A _ E L\n\nWe need to consider all possibilities and think of words.\n\nGiven we are making the third guess, we want to test multiple possibilities at once.\n\nWe also know that E cannot be at position 3 or 5. And A cannot be at 3 or 4.\n\nFirst, let me try to list possible words.\n\nPossible words with L at end and A and E present:\n\n- With A at 1: ""ABEL?"" not a word. ""ADEL"", but not common. ""AISLE"": A at 1, I, S, L, E at 5? But E at 5 is already forbidden? Also, S is forbidden now. ""AISLE"" has S? Yes, and S is not in word. So no.\n\nOther words: ""ALIKE"": A at 1, L at 2, but then L at 2 and 5? And E at 5, which is forbidden.\n\n""AMPLE"": A at 1, M, P, L, E at 5? But E at 5 forbidden.\n\n""APPLE"": A, P, P, L, E? But E at 5 forbidden.\n\nSo, for A at position 1, we need E at position 2 or 4.\n\nWith E position 2: word pattern: A E ? ? L\n\nWhat words? ""AEGIS"" not 5 letters? ""AEONS"" but has S and N? Not allowed.\n\n""AEONS"" has N and S, forbidden.\n\nNot coming up with many. Let\'s think: ""ANGEL"" but has N, forbidden.\n\nPerhaps ""AVIEW"" not a word.\n\nMaybe A at 1 is not common? But we must try.\n\nWith E at position 4: pattern A ? ? E L\n\nExamples: ""AUDEL"" not a word? ""AXEL"": A, X, E, L? But that\'s only 4? ""AXLE"" is a word: A, X, L, E. But that\'s 4 letters. No, ""axle"" is 4 letters. We need 5. So ""APPEL"": A, P, P, E, L? That\'s 5: A-P-P-E-L. But E at position 4? And L at 5. E is at position 4? Position: 1-A, 2-P, 3-P, 4-E, 5-L.\n\nYes, ""APPEL"" is a word. But it has double P? And we don\'t know about P.\n\nSimilarly, ""AMEL"" not 5.\n\nAnother idea: ""ABLED"": but has B,L,E,D, but structure: A,B,L,E,D? Not A? Position 1:A, 2:B, 3:L, 4:E, 5:D? But L is at position 3, and we need L at 5? No. L must be at 5. So the word ends with L, so last letter L.\n\nSo pattern for A? and E? with L last.\n\nWith A at 1 and E at 4: e.g., ""ANVIL""? But N forbidden. ""AWEEL"" not word.\n\nPerhaps no common words? Try case 2.\n\nCase 2: A at position 2.\n\nThen pattern: _ A _ _ L\n\nAnd E at position 1 or 4.\n\nFirst, E at position 1: pattern E A _ _ L\n\nWords: ""EAGLE"": E, A, G, L, E? But E at 1 and E at 5? But position 5 is L? ""EAGLE"": E-A-G-L-E? Positions: 1-E, 2-A, 3-G, 4-L, 5-E. But L at position 4? But we know L is at position 5, so cannot be. Also, E at 5? But forbidden.\n\n""EARLY"": E, A, R, L, Y? But R is forbidden.\n\n""EATEN"": E, A, T, E, N? But T and N forbidden.\n\n""EBOLA"": E, B, O, L, A? But L at 4, A at 5? We need L at 5, so A cannot be at 5? ""EBOLA"" ends with A? No, E-B-O-L-A. So L at 4? Not 5.\n\nThus, L must be last, so position 5 is L, so in ""EA_ _ L"", the blanks must be filled.\n\nWords like ""EASEL"": E, A, S, E, L? S forbidden, and L at position 5? Structure: 1-E, 2-A, 3-S, 4-E, 5-L. Yes, but S forbidden.\n\nOther words? Hard to find.\n\nNow, subcase E at 4: pattern _ A _ E L\n\nSo position: 1: ?, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: L\n\nAnd the first and third positions cannot be forbidden letters.\n\nExamples: ""HALEL"" not word? ""VALID"": V, A, L, I, D? But L at 3? And E? Not present. We need E at position 4.\n\n""VALET"": V, A, L, E, T? Positions: 1-V, 2-A, 3-L, 4-E, 5-T. But T forbidden, and we need L at 5? No.\n\n""MANGE"": M, A, N, G, E? But N forbidden.\n\n""PAPER"": P, A, P, E, R? R forbidden.\n\n""BAKER"": B, A, K, E, R? R forbidden.\n\n""MAKER"": M, A, K, E, R? R forbidden.\n\n""HAVEL"": not common? ""CAVIL"": C forbidden.\n\n""DAZED"": D, A, Z, E, D? D at 1 and 5? But L at 5? Not matching.\n\n""WAVED"": W, A, V, E, D? Again, L at 5 not present.\n\nBut we need the word to end with L.\n\nSo: for pattern _ A _ E L: the fourth letter is E, fifth is L.\n\nSo, position 3 must be filled and position 1.\n\nExamples: Here are some words: ""Hazel"": H, A, Z, E, L -> positions: 1-H, 2-A, 3-Z, 4-E, 5-L. Yes!\n\n""Hazel"" is a valid English word.\n\nBut we have to check if H and Z are forbidden? Not forbidden yet.\n\nSimilarly, other words: ""Fabel"" not common. ""Label"": L, A, B, E, L -> but L at position 1? And L at 5? Also, E at 4.\n\nYes, ""label"": L, A, B, E, L.\n\nBut we already have L at 5, so that\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, ""camel"": but C forbidden.\n\n""model"": M, O, D, E, L? Pattern: 1-M, 2-O, 3-D, 4-E, 5-L -> not A at second position? We need A at position 2.\n\nWe need position 2 to be A, position 4 to be E, position 5 to be L.\n\nSo, words like:\n\n- ""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> not common? But acceptable.\n- ""LABEL"": L, A, B, E, L -> L at 1 and 5? This might work.\n- ""JAVEL"" not a word.\n- ""PAVEL"" name?\n- ""RAVEL"": but R forbidden.\n- ""SABEL"" not common, and S forbidden? S is forbidden.\n- ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> but T forbidden and L at 4 not 5? And E at 5? Not matching.\n- ""MAPLE"": M A P L E -> L at position 4? Not 5.\n\nSo common words: ""HAZEL"" and ""LABEL"".\n\nIn ""LABEL"", L at position 1 and position 5. That is allowed, since L could be duplicated? But we know that L is in the word only at position 5? No, the feedback showed L at position 5 correct, but it might be in other positions? We don\'t have information about other positions.\n\nIn the second guess, we had L at 5 green, but that doesn\'t mean L isn\'t elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, in ""LABEL"", if we guess it, and if L is only at 5, then position 1 L would be marked accordingly.\n\nSimilarly for ""HAZEL"".\n\nAlso, we have the possibility where A is at position 1? Earlier we struggled.\n\nAnother word: ""AGILE"": A G I L E? Pattern: A at 1, E at 5? E at 5 forbidden? We know E not at position 5.\n\n""ALIVE"": A L I V E? E at 5 forbidden.\n\n""EXCEL"": but C forbidden, S not? E X C E L? C forbidden.\n\nPerhaps we missed some.\n\nWhat about with A at position 2 and E at position 1? Earlier ""E A _ _ L""\n\nWords: ""EALED"" not common. ""EQUAL"": E Q U A L? Positions: 1-E, 2-Q, 3-U, 4-A, 5-L. But A at 4? We need A at 2? No, that\'s not A at 2.\n\nIn this pattern, for E at 1 and A at 2, then positions 3 and 4 need letters.\n\nExample: ""EAGLE"" ? But ends with E, not L.\n\n""EARLY"" forbidden R.\n\nThere is ""EANED"" not word.\n\n""MANED"" has M A N E D? Not L?\n\nI think it\'s harder.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible words are ""HAZEL"" and ""LABEL"".\n\nBut we need to maximize information. Also, we have more to test.\n\nBut since we have to guess, let\'s pick one that tests new letters.\n\nIn ""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L. We haven\'t tested H and Z.\n\nIn ""LABEL"": L, A, B, E, L. We haven\'t tested B, and L is already known at 5 but might be duplicated.\n\nBut in ""LABEL"", we have L at position 1, which is new.\n\nSimilarly, we know E is not at 3 or 5, but in ""HAZEL"" or ""LABEL"", E is at 4.\n\nNow, also, we know A is not at 3 or 4, so in both, A is at 2? In ""HAZEL"" and ""LABEL"", A is at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, L at 5 is fixed.\n\nNow, we also need to consider that in the first guess, E was at position 5 (forbidden) and in the second guess E was at 3 (forbidden). Now, in ""HAZEL"" or ""LABEL"", E is at position 4, which has not been tried, so possible.\n\nSimilarly, A is at position 2, which has not been tried (in first guess A at 3, in second A at 4, now at 2).\n\nSo, both are candidates.\n\nBut let\'s think if there is another word I missed.\n\n""OVAL"" not 5.\n\nOr ""IDEAL"": but I D E A L? Pattern: 1-I, 2-D, 3-E, 4-A, 5-L. But E at position 3 is forbidden? From second guess, we know E not at position 3. So ""IDEAL"" has E at 3, invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""VIELA"" not word.\n\nSo, ""HAZEL"" and ""LABEL"" seem the main options.\n\nWe could guess ""LABEL"" to test if L is duplicated? But we don\'t know.\n\nAnother word: ""BADEL"" not common.\n\nI think we should choose one.\n\nPerhaps ""HAZEL"" because it uses less common letters and might reduce possibilities faster? Or ""LABEL"" to test L.\n\nBut let me observe that in ""steal"", we had L at 5 correct, so if we put L at 1 in ""label"", it might tell us if L is duplicated.\n\nBut we know E is at some wrong position? We don\'t know about duplication.\n\nSo, let\'s try ""label"".\n\nBut wait, we need to confirm if ""label"" is accepted Wordle word. I believe it is.\n\nSimilarly, ""hazel"".\n\nBut we have to avoid S,T, etc.\n\nNow, from feedback, we have L fixed at 5, and we need A at 1 or 2, and E at 1,2, or4 but not3 or5.\n\nIn ""label"", A at 2, E at 4, L at 1 and 5. So if L is not duplicated, position 1 L will be marked wrong or absent.\n\nSimilarly, in ""hazel"", H and Z are new.\n\nPerhaps ""label"" is a safer guess.\n\nBut let\'s think about case with A at position 1.\n\nI found ""ABBEY"" no E? ""ABLED"": A, B, L, E, D, but L at pos3, not5.\n\n""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U? E at pos4, L not present.\n\nBut we need L at 5.\n\n""ADDLE"": A, D, D, L, E? But E at5 forbidden.\n\n""AMPLE"" forbidden E at5.\n\nSo no 5-letter words with A at1 and L at5 and E at2 or4? For example, E at2: ""A E _ _ L"" -> ""Aegis"" not 5? ""Aerie"" not.\n\n""aeled"" not word.\n\nOr ""aeons"" forbidden.\n\nSo, A at position 1 doesn\'t seem to yield valid words. Therefore, A must be at position 2.\n\nThus, pattern _ A _ _ L, with E at position 1 or 4.\n\nE at1: pattern E A _ _ L -> words like ""Eagle"" not, ""Easel"" forbidden.\n\n""Eastern"" too long.\n\n""early"" forbidden.\n\nE at4: pattern _ A _ E L -> words like ""label"", ""hazel"", ""maple"" but maple no E? Maple: M A P L E, E at5 forbidden.\n\n""ample"" similar.\n\nSo, indeed, ""label"" and ""hazel"".\n\nNow, we can choose ""label"" as a guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is ""bagel"": B A G E L? Positions: B at1, A at2, G at3, E at4, L at5. Yes, ""bagel"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""basel"" not common? ""vowel"" not A.\n\n""jewel"" no A.\n\nSo ""bagel"" is another option: B, A, G, E, L.\n\nWith B, G tested.\n\nSimilarly, ""gavel"": G A V E L? But ""gavel"" is G A V E L, so position 1-G, 2-A, 3-V, 4-E, 5-L.\n\nAlso possible.\n\nSo, possible words: ""LABEL"", ""HAZEL"", ""BAGEL"", ""GAVEL"", etc.\n\nWe have several options.\n\nBut we must choose one for third guess.\n\nTo make progress, we should choose a word that tests letters we haven\'t tried and covers common possibilities.\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, N, S, T.\n\nWe have tried A, E, L.\n\nUnknown letters: let\'s pick common ones.\n\n""B"" and ""G"" are common in ""BAGEL"".\n\n"" H"" and ""Z"" in ""HAZEL"" are less common.\n\nSo to eliminate more, perhaps ""bagel"" is a good choice.\n\nWith ""bagel"", we test B and G.\n\nSimilarly, ""label"" tests L at position 1 and B.\n\nBut L is already known to be in the word at position 5, so duplicating might not give as much information? But it could.\n\nI think ""bagel"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""bagel"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the positions: ""BAGEL"" -> B at1, A at2, G at3, E at4, L at5.\n\nConstraints:\n- A is at position 2: which is new (previously tried at 3 and 4, not 2).\n- E is at position 4: which was tried at 5 (not allowed) and at 3 (not allowed), now at 4, new position.\n- L at 5, known correct.\n\nSo, if we get feedback, we can pin down if A at 2 or E at 4 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, B at 1 and G at 3 are new.\n\nSo, good for information.\n\nTherefore, third guess: ""bagel""\n\nIn summary:\n- From first guess: A and E in word, not at positions 3 and 5 respectively.\n- From second guess: L at position 5 correct; E not at 3; A not at 4. Also S and T absent.\n- Thus, A must be at 1 or 2, but words with A at 1 are scarce, so likely at 2. And E at 1 or 4.\n- Guessing ""BAGEL"" to test A at 2 and E at 4, and letters B and G.\n\n<guess>bagel</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n1. **First guess: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\n   - This indicates that:\n     - C, R, and N are not in the secret word.\n     - A is in the word but not at position 3.\n     - E is in the word but not at position 5.\n\n2. **Second guess: ""steal""** → Feedback: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(✓)\n   - This indicates that:\n     - S and T are not in the secret word.\n     - E is in the word but not at position 3.\n     - A is in the word but not at position 4.\n     - L is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.\n\n### Key Inferences:\n- **Confirmed letters and positions:** \n  - L is fixed at position 5 (from the ✓ in ""steal"").\n- **Letters in the word (but wrong positions):** \n  - A is in the word, but cannot be at positions 3 (from ""crane"") or 4 (from ""steal""). Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 2.\n  - E is in the word, but cannot be at positions 5 (from ""crane"") or 3 (from ""steal""). Therefore, E must be at position 1, 2, or 4 (position 5 is taken by L).\n- **Absent letters:** C, R, N, S, T (eliminated).\n- **Word structure:** The secret word ends with L (position 5). Given the constraints on A and E, the only feasible patterns are:\n  - A at position 1: Pattern `A ? ? E L` (E at position 4) or `A E ? ? L` (E at position 2). However, common English words with A at position 1 and L at position 5 are rare when avoiding the forbidden letters.\n  - A at position 2: Pattern `? A ? E L` (E at position 4) or `E A ? ? L` (E at position 1). Words like ""label"", ""hazel"", ""bagel"", or ""gavel"" fit, with E at position 4 being more common.\n\nGiven this, ""bagel"" is a strong guess:\n- **Structure:** `B A G E L`, placing A at position 2 (new position to test) and E at position 4 (also new, avoiding previously invalid positions).\n- **Benefits:** Tests new common consonants (B and G) while satisfying all known constraints.

We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-): 
   - A and E are in the word, but not at positions 3 and 5, respectively.
   - C, R, N are absent.

2. ""steal"" -> S(x), T(x), E(-), A(-), L(✓):
   - L is at position 5 (correct).
   - E is in the word but not at position 3.
   - A is in the word but not at position 4.
   - S and T are absent.

3. ""bagel"" -> B(x), A(✓), G(-), E(✓), L(✓):
   - A at position 2 is correct (so A is fixed at position 2).
   - E at position 4 is correct (so E is fixed at position 4).
   - L at position 5 is correct (already known).
   - G is in the word but not at position 3 (since in ""bagel"", G is at position 3).
   - B is absent.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has fixed positions: 
  - Position 2: A
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: L
- So the word pattern: _ A _ E L

- Absent letters: B, C, N, R, S, T (from previous guesses).
- G is present but not at position 3.

Since positions 2, 4, and 5 are fixed as A, E, L, we need to determine position 1 and position 3.

Position 3 is currently unknown, but we know G is in the word and not at position 3. Therefore, G must be at position 1? Because the only positions left are 1 and 3.

The word has five positions: 
1 - ? 
2 - A (fixed)
3 - ? 
4 - E (fixed)
5 - L (fixed)

We know G is present in the word (from feedback on ""bagel"": G(-) meaning G is in the word but not at position 3). Therefore, G must be at position 1? Because that's the only other open slot? Actually, no: G could be at position 1, or it could be duplicated? But we don't have evidence of duplication yet.

The feedback tells us G is in the word and not at position 3. It doesn't say if it's at other positions. So the secret word must have a G somewhere, and since position 3 is incorrect, and positions 2,4,5 are fixed (and not G), G must be either at position 1 or not? Positions 2,4,5 are fixed to A, E, L respectively, so they are not G. Therefore, G must be at position 1? Because that's the only position left? But position 3 is also open? However, if G is at position 3, but the feedback from ""bagel"" says G at position 3 is wrong (because it was marked ""-"" meaning present but not at position 3). So G cannot be at position 3. Therefore, since positions 2,4,5 are taken, G must be at position 1.

But wait: what about duplication? For example, the word might have G at position 1 and another G at position 3? But that seems unlikely. Moreover, the feedback for ""bagel"" had G marked as ""-"", meaning the letter G is present but not at position 3. It doesn't tell us about other positions.

However, if the word has G at position 1, then position 3 could be something else.

But if the word does not have G at position 1, then G must be at position 3? But that contradicts because ""bagel"" had G at position 3 and it was marked ""-"", meaning G is not at position 3. Therefore, G must be at position 1? Since that's the only other position.

But position 1 might not have G! For example, the secret word could be ""HAZEL"", which has no G? But wait, we have feedback that G is present? From guess 3: G(-) means G is in the word (but not at position 3). So G must be in the word.

Therefore, for the secret word, which has pattern _ A _ E L, and G must be somewhere. Since positions 2,4,5 are A,E,L (not G), and position 3 cannot be G (because in ""bagel"" G was at position 3 and reported as not there), then G must be at position 1.

Therefore, the secret word must have G at position 1? Then position 3 would be something else.

That would give: G A ? E L

But we need to fill position 3.

We also know that the letters must come from the alphabet minus absent letters.

Absent letters: B, C, N, R, S, T.

Available letters: D, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

Moreover, we don't know any other letter that must be present? Only that G is present and must be at position 1? So position 3 can be any letter not forbidden.

But let's confirm: if the secret word has G at position 1, then it fits: G A X E L, where X is any letter not absent.

But are there words? For example, ""GAVEL"": G A V E L -> but V at position 3? Yes! ""GAVEL"" is a word.

Similarly, ""GAMEL"" not common? ""GABLE"" but B is absent? B is absent (from bagel feedback).

""GAMEL"" not standard.

But ""GAVEL"" works.

Are there others? ""GAUZE"" but E and L? Pattern G A U Z E? Not E at 4 and L at 5? ""GAUZE"" is G A U Z E -> position 4 is Z, not E? And ends with E, not L? No.

We need position 4 E and position 5 L.

So only position 1 and 3 are open? And we think position 1 must be G.

Therefore, words: ""G A ? E L""

? must be a letter not absent.

What are possible letters? Vowels or consonants? Common: D, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Words:
- ""GAVEL"": G A V E L -> V at position 3.
- ""GAZEL"" not a word? ""Gazelle"" too long.
- ""GAILE"" not word.
- ""GALE"" too short? No, 5 letters? G A L E L? But position 3 is L? Then G A L E L? But that would be duplicated L? Position 5 is L, but position 3 L? Possible: ""GALEL"" not word.
- ""GAMEL"" not common.
- ""GAPEL"" not word.
- ""GAWEL"" not word.

But ""GAVEL"" is a known word.

Another possibility: ""HAGEL"" not common? Or ""KAGEL"" not.

But we have ""novel"" but N absent? No.

Perhaps it must be ""GAVEL"".

But wait, what if the word has duplication? For example, if G is not at position 1, but duplicated at position 1? But position 1 is one slot.

Earlier logic: G must be at position 1 because no other place.

But let me double-check: secret word must contain G. The positions: 2,4,5 are fixed as A,E,L. Position 3 cannot be G because in ""bagel"", when G was placed at position 3, it got a ""-"" meaning G is not there. Therefore, G cannot be at position 3. Then the only remaining position is position 1. So G must be at position 1.

Therefore, the secret word is G A _ E L, with the blank being a letter not in the forbidden list.

What words fit? ""GAVEL"" is a common word.

Others: ""GAMEL""? Not standard. ""GAZEL"" not a word. ""GABLE"" is a word but B is absent? B is not in the word? From bagel: B(x) so B is absent. ""GABLE"" has B? G A B L E -> positions: 1-G,2-A,3-B,4-L? But our pattern requires position 4 to be E? Not L? No, in ""GABLE"", it ends with LE? Positions: 1-G,2-A,3-B,4-L,5-E? But pattern should be _ A _ E L, so position 4 must be E? In ""GABLE"", position 4 is L and 5 is E? That doesn't match.

So only ""GAVEL"" fits: G A V E L.

Therefore, we should guess ""gavel"".

But to confirm: is V absent? Not forbidden so far? Yes.

Also, pattern matches: position 1: G, 2: A (fixed), 3: V, 4: E (fixed), 5: L (fixed).

And G is at position 1? Yes.

Now, feedback: in ""bagel"", G was at 3 and marked ""-"", meaning G is present but not at 3. And G at position 1 is a new position.

Similarly, V is tested.

So, we can guess ""gavel"".

But are there other words? For example, ""GAZEL"" is not a word, but ""GAVEL"" is.

""GAELS"" has S? S absent? And not E at 4? GAELS: G A E L S? Positions: 1-G,2-A,3-E? But E is at position 4? Not 3. GAELS is G,A,E,L,S? Pattern: 1-G,2-A,3-E,4-L,5-S? Does not match _ A _ E L with E at 4? Position 4 is L? Not E? No, E is at 3? But we need position 4 to be E? Here position 4 is L? Not matching.

So, ""GAVEL"" seems the only common word.

Perhaps ""GADEL"" not word.

Therefore, the secret word is ""GAVEL"".

But we are to guess, so let's guess ""gavel"".

### Step-by-Step Thought Process

We have feedback from three previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Feedback C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-).  
  → A and E are in the word but not at positions 3 or 5, respectively. C, R, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""steal"")**: Feedback S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(✓).  
  → L is correctly placed at position 5. E is not at position 3, A is not at position 4. S, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""bagel"")**: Feedback B(x) A(✓) G(-) E(✓) L(✓).  
  → A is correctly placed at position 2. E is correctly placed at position 4. L is correctly placed at position 5 (confirmed). G is in the word but not at position 3. B is absent.

### Key Inferences:
- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 2: A (from ""bagel"" ✓).
  - Position 4: E (from ""bagel"" ✓).
  - Position 5: L (from ""steal"" and ""bagel"" ✓).
- **Word pattern**: The secret word must be `_ A _ E L`.
- **Present letters confirmed**: 
  - G is in the word (from ""bagel"" -), but it cannot be at position 3 (since it received ""-"" in ""bagel"" at that spot).
- **Absent letters**: From all feedback: B, C, N, R, S, T are absent.
- **Analysis of positions**:
  - G cannot be at position 3 (feedback), and positions 2, 4, 5 are fixed as A, E, L (so G isn't there). The only remaining position is 1. Thus, **G must be at position 1**.
  - Position 3 must be an untested letter that is not absent (e.g., not B, C, N, R, S, T). It must form a valid English word.
- **Possible words**: With the pattern `G A _ E L`, only one common English word fits: **""GAVEL""** (with V at position 3). This is consistent with all feedback:
  - Position 1: G (as deduced).
  - Position 2: A (fixed).
  - Position 3: V (untested letter).
  - Position 4: E (fixed).
  - Position 5: L (fixed).

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and pattern, ""GAVEL"" is the only plausible guess. It confirms the deduced position for G and tests V, resolving the word.

- **Guess 3 (""bagel"")**: Feedback B(x) A(✓) G(-) E(✓) L(✓).  
  → A is correctly placed at position 2. E is correctly placed at position 4. L is correctly placed at position 5 (confirmed). G is in the word but not at position 3. B is absent.

### Key Inferences:
- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 2: A (from ""bagel"" ✓).
  - Position 4: E (from ""bagel"" ✓).
  - Position 5: L (from ""steal"" and ""bagel"" ✓).
- **Word pattern**: The secret word must be `_ A _ E L`.
- **Present letters confirmed**: 
  - G is in the word (from ""bagel"" -), but it cannot be at position 3 (since it received ""-"" in ""bagel"" at that spot).
- **Absent letters**: From all feedback: B, C, N, R, S, T are absent.
- **Analysis of positions**:
  - G cannot be at position 3 (feedback), and positions 2, 4, 5 are fixed as A, E, L (so G isn't there). The only remaining position is 1. Thus, **G must be at position 1**.
  - Position 3 must be an untested letter that is not absent (e.g., not B, C, N, R, S, T). It must form a valid English word.
- **Possible words**: With the pattern `G A _ E L`, only one common English word fits: **""GAVEL""** (with V at position 3). This is consistent with all feedback:
  - Position 1: G (as deduced).
  - Position 2: A (fixed).
  - Position 3: V (untested letter).
  - Position 4: E (fixed).
  - Position 5: L (fixed).

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and pattern, ""GAVEL"" is the only plausible guess. It confirms the deduced position for G and tests V, resolving the word.",Guess 4: gavel -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) A(✓) V(✓) E(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
