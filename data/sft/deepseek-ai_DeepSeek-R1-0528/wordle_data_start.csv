We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the word and is in the correct position (3rd letter, since positions are 1-indexed: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5). Therefore, the 3rd letter of the secret word is 'A'.
- The letter 'R' is in the word but not in the 2nd position. So it must be in one of the other positions: 1, 4, or 5 (but note that position 3 is taken by 'A').
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all. So we must avoid using these letters in future guesses.

We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long and is an English word.

For our next guess, we should:
1. Include the letter 'A' in the 3rd position.
2. Include the letter 'R' but not in the 2nd position (so it could be in position 1, 4, or 5).
3. Avoid using the letters C, N, and E.

We want to maximize the information we get by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have:
- 'A' as the third letter
- 'R' somewhere else (position 1, 4, or 5)
- Avoid C, N, E

Also, we should try to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet to get more feedback.

Common consonants we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we avoid C, N, E).

We can try to use a word that has 'R' in the first position? Or maybe in the fourth or fifth.

Let's consider words with the pattern: _ _ A _ _

We know the word must contain an 'R' (but not in the second position). So possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5.

We also want to test other common letters. For example, we might try to include S, T, L, etc.

Possible words:
- If we put R in the first position: R _ A _ _
  - Examples: ""RADAR"" (but has R in first and last, and A in third and fifth? But we know A is only in third? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. The secret word might have two A's? But in our feedback, we only have one A and it was correct. However, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters unless we guess them. So we must be cautious. But in this case, we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven't ruled out duplicates. But for now, let's avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one A and it was correct. If the word had two A's, but we only guessed one, then we wouldn't know about the other. Similarly, for R, we only know there's at least one R.

So, let's try to form a word that has R in a new position and uses new letters.

Idea: put R in the first position and use common letters for the rest.

Word: ""RATIO"" -> but that has T and I and O, which are new. However, the pattern would be R A T I O? But wait, we need the third letter to be A. In ""RATIO"", the third letter is T, not A. So that doesn't work.

We need the third letter to be A. So the pattern is: _ _ A _ _

With R in the first position: R _ A _ _

Possible words: 
- ""ROAST"": R O A S T -> but O, S, T are new. However, we have to avoid E, C, N. This seems okay. But note: the second letter is O, which we haven't tried. Also, we have S and T.

But wait, in ""ROAST"", the third letter is A? Yes: positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T.

But we also have the constraint that R is not in the second position? Actually, in this word, R is in the first, which is fine. And we are including R, which we know is in the word.

Alternatively, we could put R in the fourth position: _ _ A R _
Or fifth: _ _ A _ R

But let's think about what we can test. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common starting approach is to try a word that uses the known correct letter and the known present letter, and then three new letters.

So, let's try to form a word with:
- Position 3: A
- R in either 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2, because we already tried R in position 2 and it was wrong).

We also want to avoid C, N, E.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and include R and avoid C, N, E.

Option 1: R in position 1 -> R _ A _ _
  Words: ""ROAST"", ""RABAT"" (not common), ""RADAR"" (has two R's and two A's, but we don't know about duplicates), ""RAPID"", ""RASPY"", ""RAYON"" (has N, which is bad because we know N is not in the word). So we avoid words with N.

  ""ROAST"": R O A S T -> no C, N, E. Good.
  ""RAPID"": R A P I D -> but wait, the third letter is P? No: R (1), A (2), P (3) -> so that doesn't have A in the third. We need the third letter to be A.

  Actually, for ""RAPID"": 
    Position 1: R
    Position 2: A
    Position 3: P -> so that's not A in the third. We need the third letter to be A.

  So we must have the pattern: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.

  Therefore, for R in first: R (letter1), then any letter for letter2 (but not R because we don't want to repeat unless necessary? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed), then A (third), then two more.

  So ""ROAST"": R (1), O (2), A (3), S (4), T (5) -> valid.

  Similarly, ""RALLY"": R (1), A (2) -> wait, no: R (1), A (2), L (3) -> but we need A at position 3. So that's not.

  Another: ""REAST"" (archaic, not common) -> avoid.

  ""ROARS"": R (1), O (2), A (3), R (4), S (5) -> but has two R's? And we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we are avoiding E, C, N? It doesn't have those. But it's a valid word.

  However, we want to use distinct letters to maximize information? But if we use duplicate R, we might not get full information. But we know R is in the word, so if we put R in two positions, we might get feedback on both.

  But since we are limited by the known constraints, let's try to avoid duplicates for now to cover more letters.

  So ""ROAST"" is a good candidate: uses O, S, T which are common.

Option 2: R in the fourth position: _ _ A R _
  Words: ""STARL"" (not a word), ""SCARF"" (has C? C is not allowed because we know C is not in the word). We must avoid C.
  ""ALTAR"": A (1), L (2), T (3) -> wait, we need A at position 3? No: in ""ALTAR"": A(1), L(2), T(3), A(4), R(5). So the third letter is T, not A. We need the third letter to be A.

  So pattern: letter1, letter2, A, R, letter5.

  Words: ""LIAR?"" -> but that's 4 letters. 5-letter words: ""GUARD"" -> G(1), U(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). This avoids C, N, E. But we haven't tested G, U, D.

  ""HEARD"" -> but H, E: we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E. So avoid.

  ""BOARD"": B(1), O(2), A(3), R(4), D(5) -> avoids C, N, E. Good.

  ""HOARD"": same as above but H.

  ""SOARE"" (a falconry term, not common) and has E -> avoid.

  ""FJORD"": F(1), J(2), O(3) -> wait, third letter is O? We need A at third. So no.

  So ""BOARD"" is a candidate: B, O, A, R, D.

Option 3: R in the fifth position: _ _ A _ R
  Words: ""PIZAR"" (not common), ""TUTAR"" (not a word), ""SONAR"" -> S(1), O(2), N(3) -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So avoid.
  ""LARVA"": L(1), A(2), R(3) -> but we need A at position 3? No: A is at position 2. We need A at position 3.

  Pattern: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, R.

  Words: ""DEBAR"" -> D(1), E(2) -> E is not allowed. Avoid.
  ""JUMAR"" (not common), ""COMA R"" -> but C is not allowed.

  ""VAPOR"": V(1), A(2), P(3) -> no, we need A at position 3.

  It's hard to find common words with R at the end and A at the third.

  ""SUGAR"": S(1), U(2), G(3) -> but we need A at position 3? In ""SUGAR"": S(1), U(2), G(3), A(4), R(5). So the third letter is G, not A. 

  ""LUMAR"" (not common).

  So maybe not many options for R at the end.

Therefore, the two strong candidates are:
1. ""ROAST"" (R at position 1, and then O, S, T)
2. ""BOARD"" (R at position 4, and then B, O, D)

We can also consider putting R in the fourth position and use other letters.

Another candidate: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2) -> no, we need A at position 3. So that's P(1), A(2), R(3) -> but we need A at 3, so that's not.

""GRAPY"" (not a word).

""TRAIN"": T(1), R(2) -> but we cannot put R in the second position because we already tried R in the second position and it was wrong (in ""crane"", R was in second and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not in that position). So we must avoid putting R in the second position.

Therefore, in ""TRAIN"", R is in the second position -> avoid.

So back to ""ROAST"" and ""BOARD"".

Which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""ROAST"": we are testing R (which we know is present) in a new position (position 1), and then O, S, T. We also have A in the correct position (so we expect a check for A).

In ""BOARD"": we are testing B, O, D, and R in position 4 (which we haven't tried), and A in the correct position.

Both are good. But note that in ""ROAST"", we are using S and T which are very common. Also, we are testing R in the first position. If R is actually in the first position, we get a check. If not, then we know R must be in position 4 or 5.

In ""BOARD"", we are testing R in the fourth position.

We might also consider ""ROARS"" but that has duplicate R and S, which might not be as informative.

Another word: ""RASPS"" -> but has S twice and we don't know if S is in the word.

But let's stick to common words.

I think ""ROAST"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we can get a lot of information.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't have R in it? But wait, we know R is in the word, so we should use it to get position information. But we are allowed to not use R? However, if we don't use R, we won't get information about its position. So it's better to use R.

So I'll go with ""ROAST"".

But note: we are not forced to use R? Actually, we know R is in the word, so we should try to find its position. Therefore, we should include R in our next guess.

So, let's guess ""ROAST"".

But wait, what if the word has two R's? We don't know. But that's okay.

So, the next guess: ""ROAST""

We'll get feedback on:
- R in position 1: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, then we know R is in position 4 or 5 (because we know it's not in 2, and we are testing 1 now).
- O in position 2: we don't know about O, so we'll get feedback.
- A in position 3: we know it's correct, so we expect a check.
- S in position 4: new letter.
- T in position 5: new letter.

This should give us good information.

Therefore, I choose ""ROAST"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""A"" is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- ""R"" is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- The 3rd letter must be ""A"".
- ""R"" must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1, 4, or 5 are possible).
- Avoid using ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"".
- To maximize information, include new common letters and test ""R"" in a new position.

The word ""roast"" fits these criteria:
- 3rd letter is ""A"".
- ""R"" is in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Avoids ""C"", ""N"", ""E"".
- Introduces new common letters: ""O"", ""S"", ""T"".

This guess will help identify the position of ""R"" and provide feedback on ""O"", ""S"", and ""T"".

<guess>roast</guess>",roast,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the word and is in the correct position (3rd letter, since positions are 1-indexed: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5). Therefore, the 3rd letter of the secret word is 'A'.

  ""RAPID"": R A P I D -> but wait, the third letter is P? No: R (1), A (2), P (3) -> so that doesn't have A in the third. We need the third letter to be A.

  Actually, for ""RAPID"":

  So ""ROAST"": R (1), O (2), A (3), S (4), T (5) -> valid.

  Similarly, ""RALLY"": R (1), A (2) -> wait, no: R (1), A (2), L (3) -> but we need A at position 3. So that's not.

  Another: ""REAST"" (archaic, not common) -> avoid.

  ""ALTAR"": A (1), L (2), T (3) -> wait, we need A at position 3? No: in ""ALTAR"": A(1), L(2), T(3), A(4), R(5). So the third letter is T, not A. We need the third letter to be A.

  So pattern: letter1, letter2, A, R, letter5.

  Pattern: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, R.

  Words: ""DEBAR"" -> D(1), E(2) -> E is not allowed. Avoid.
  ""JUMAR"" (not common), ""COMA R"" -> but C is not allowed.

  ""VAPOR"": V(1), A(2), P(3) -> no, we need A at position 3.

  It's hard to find common words with R at the end and A at the third.

  ""SUGAR"": S(1), U(2), G(3) -> but we need A at position 3? In ""SUGAR"": S(1), U(2), G(3), A(4), R(5). So the third letter is G, not A. 

  ""LUMAR"" (not common).

  So maybe not many options for R at the end.

Therefore, the two strong candidates are:
1. ""ROAST"" (R at position 1, and then O, S, T)
2. ""BOARD"" (R at position 4, and then B, O, D)

We can also consider putting R in the fourth position and use other letters.

Another candidate: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2) -> no, we need A at position 3. So that's P(1), A(2), R(3) -> but we need A at 3, so that's not.

""GRAPY"" (not a word).

""TRAIN"": T(1), R(2) -> but we cannot put R in the second position because we already tried R in the second position and it was wrong (in ""crane"", R was in second and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not in that position). So we must avoid putting R in the second position.

Therefore, in ""TRAIN"", R is in the second position -> avoid.

So back to ""ROAST"" and ""BOARD"".

Which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""ROAST"": we are testing R (which we know is present) in a new position (position 1), and then O, S, T. We also have A in the correct position (so we expect a check for A).

In ""BOARD"": we are testing B, O, D, and R in position 4 (which we haven't tried), and A in the correct position.

Both are good. But note that in ""ROAST"", we are using S and T which are very common. Also, we are testing R in the first position. If R is actually in the first position, we get a check. If not, then we know R must be in position 4 or 5.

In ""BOARD"", we are testing R in the fourth position.

We might also consider ""ROARS"" but that has duplicate R and S, which might not be as informative.

Another word: ""RASPS"" -> but has S twice and we don't know if S is in the word.

But let's stick to common words.

I think ""ROAST"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we can get a lot of information.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't have R in it? But wait, we know R is in the word, so we should use it to get position information. But we are allowed to not use R? However, if we don't use R, we won't get information about its position. So it's better to use R.

So I'll go with ""ROAST"".

But note: we are not forced to use R? Actually, we know R is in the word, so we should try to find its position. Therefore, we should include R in our next guess.

So, let's guess ""ROAST"".

But wait, what if the word has two R's? We don't know. But that's okay.

So, the next guess: ""ROAST""

We'll get feedback on:
- R in position 1: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, then we know R is in position 4 or 5 (because we know it's not in 2, and we are testing 1 now).
- O in position 2: we don't know about O, so we'll get feedback.
- A in position 3: we know it's correct, so we expect a check.
- S in position 4: new letter.
- T in position 5: new letter.

This should give us good information.

Therefore, I choose ""ROAST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""A"" is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- ""R"" is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- The 3rd letter must be ""A"".
- ""R"" must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1, 4, or 5 are possible).
- Avoid using ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"".
- To maximize information, include new common letters and test ""R"" in a new position.

The word ""roast"" fits these criteria:
- 3rd letter is ""A"".
- ""R"" is in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Avoids ""C"", ""N"", ""E"".
- Introduces new common letters: ""O"", ""S"", ""T"".

This guess will help identify the position of ""R"" and provide feedback on ""O"", ""S"", and ""T"".",Guess 2: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(-) T(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the word and is in the correct position (3rd letter, since positions are 1-indexed: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5). Therefore, the 3rd letter of the secret word is 'A'.
- The letter 'R' is in the word but not in the 2nd position. So it must be in one of the other positions: 1, 4, or 5 (but note that position 3 is taken by 'A').
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all. So we must avoid using these letters in future guesses.

We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long and is an English word.

For our next guess, we should:
1. Include the letter 'A' in the 3rd position.
2. Include the letter 'R' but not in the 2nd position (so it could be in position 1, 4, or 5).
3. Avoid using the letters C, N, and E.

We want to maximize the information we get by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have:
- 'A' as the third letter
- 'R' somewhere else (position 1, 4, or 5)
- Avoid C, N, E

Also, we should try to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet to get more feedback.

Common consonants we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we avoid C, N, E).

We can try to use a word that has 'R' in the first position? Or maybe in the fourth or fifth.

Let's consider words with the pattern: _ _ A _ _

We know the word must contain an 'R' (but not in the second position). So possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5.

We also want to test other common letters. For example, we might try to include S, T, L, etc.

Possible words:
- If we put R in the first position: R _ A _ _
  - Examples: ""RADAR"" (but has R in first and last, and A in third and fifth? But we know A is only in third? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. The secret word might have two A's? But in our feedback, we only have one A and it was correct. However, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters unless we guess them. So we must be cautious. But in this case, we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven't ruled out duplicates. But for now, let's avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one A and it was correct. If the word had two A's, but we only guessed one, then we wouldn't know about the other. Similarly, for R, we only know there's at least one R.

So, let's try to form a word that has R in a new position and uses new letters.

Idea: put R in the first position and use common letters for the rest.

Word: ""RATIO"" -> but that has T and I and O, which are new. However, the pattern would be R A T I O? But wait, we need the third letter to be A. In ""RATIO"", the third letter is T, not A. So that doesn't work.

We need the third letter to be A. So the pattern is: _ _ A _ _

With R in the first position: R _ A _ _

Possible words: 
- ""ROAST"": R O A S T -> but O, S, T are new. However, we have to avoid E, C, N. This seems okay. But note: the second letter is O, which we haven't tried. Also, we have S and T.

But wait, in ""ROAST"", the third letter is A? Yes: positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T.

But we also have the constraint that R is not in the second position? Actually, in this word, R is in the first, which is fine. And we are including R, which we know is in the word.

Alternatively, we could put R in the fourth position: _ _ A R _
Or fifth: _ _ A _ R

But let's think about what we can test. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common starting approach is to try a word that uses the known correct letter and the known present letter, and then three new letters.

So, let's try to form a word with:
- Position 3: A
- R in either 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2, because we already tried R in position 2 and it was wrong).

We also want to avoid C, N, E.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and include R and avoid C, N, E.

Option 1: R in position 1 -> R _ A _ _
  Words: ""ROAST"", ""RABAT"" (not common), ""RADAR"" (has two R's and two A's, but we don't know about duplicates), ""RAPID"", ""RASPY"", ""RAYON"" (has N, which is bad because we know N is not in the word). So we avoid words with N.

  ""ROAST"": R O A S T -> no C, N, E. Good.
  ""RAPID"": R A P I D -> but wait, the third letter is P? No: R (1), A (2), P (3) -> so that doesn't have A in the third. We need the third letter to be A.

  Actually, for ""RAPID"": 
    Position 1: R
    Position 2: A
    Position 3: P -> so that's not A in the third. We need the third letter to be A.

  So we must have the pattern: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.

  Therefore, for R in first: R (letter1), then any letter for letter2 (but not R because we don't want to repeat unless necessary? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed), then A (third), then two more.

  So ""ROAST"": R (1), O (2), A (3), S (4), T (5) -> valid.

  Similarly, ""RALLY"": R (1), A (2) -> wait, no: R (1), A (2), L (3) -> but we need A at position 3. So that's not.

  Another: ""REAST"" (archaic, not common) -> avoid.

  ""ROARS"": R (1), O (2), A (3), R (4), S (5) -> but has two R's? And we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we are avoiding E, C, N? It doesn't have those. But it's a valid word.

  However, we want to use distinct letters to maximize information? But if we use duplicate R, we might not get full information. But we know R is in the word, so if we put R in two positions, we might get feedback on both.

  But since we are limited by the known constraints, let's try to avoid duplicates for now to cover more letters.

  So ""ROAST"" is a good candidate: uses O, S, T which are common.

Option 2: R in the fourth position: _ _ A R _
  Words: ""STARL"" (not a word), ""SCARF"" (has C? C is not allowed because we know C is not in the word). We must avoid C.
  ""ALTAR"": A (1), L (2), T (3) -> wait, we need A at position 3? No: in ""ALTAR"": A(1), L(2), T(3), A(4), R(5). So the third letter is T, not A. We need the third letter to be A.

  So pattern: letter1, letter2, A, R, letter5.

  Words: ""LIAR?"" -> but that's 4 letters. 5-letter words: ""GUARD"" -> G(1), U(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). This avoids C, N, E. But we haven't tested G, U, D.

  ""HEARD"" -> but H, E: we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E. So avoid.

  ""BOARD"": B(1), O(2), A(3), R(4), D(5) -> avoids C, N, E. Good.

  ""HOARD"": same as above but H.

  ""SOARE"" (a falconry term, not common) and has E -> avoid.

  ""FJORD"": F(1), J(2), O(3) -> wait, third letter is O? We need A at third. So no.

  So ""BOARD"" is a candidate: B, O, A, R, D.

Option 3: R in the fifth position: _ _ A _ R
  Words: ""PIZAR"" (not common), ""TUTAR"" (not a word), ""SONAR"" -> S(1), O(2), N(3) -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So avoid.
  ""LARVA"": L(1), A(2), R(3) -> but we need A at position 3? No: A is at position 2. We need A at position 3.

  Pattern: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, R.

  Words: ""DEBAR"" -> D(1), E(2) -> E is not allowed. Avoid.
  ""JUMAR"" (not common), ""COMA R"" -> but C is not allowed.

  ""VAPOR"": V(1), A(2), P(3) -> no, we need A at position 3.

  It's hard to find common words with R at the end and A at the third.

  ""SUGAR"": S(1), U(2), G(3) -> but we need A at position 3? In ""SUGAR"": S(1), U(2), G(3), A(4), R(5). So the third letter is G, not A. 

  ""LUMAR"" (not common).

  So maybe not many options for R at the end.

Therefore, the two strong candidates are:
1. ""ROAST"" (R at position 1, and then O, S, T)
2. ""BOARD"" (R at position 4, and then B, O, D)

We can also consider putting R in the fourth position and use other letters.

Another candidate: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2) -> no, we need A at position 3. So that's P(1), A(2), R(3) -> but we need A at 3, so that's not.

""GRAPY"" (not a word).

""TRAIN"": T(1), R(2) -> but we cannot put R in the second position because we already tried R in the second position and it was wrong (in ""crane"", R was in second and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not in that position). So we must avoid putting R in the second position.

Therefore, in ""TRAIN"", R is in the second position -> avoid.

So back to ""ROAST"" and ""BOARD"".

Which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""ROAST"": we are testing R (which we know is present) in a new position (position 1), and then O, S, T. We also have A in the correct position (so we expect a check for A).

In ""BOARD"": we are testing B, O, D, and R in position 4 (which we haven't tried), and A in the correct position.

Both are good. But note that in ""ROAST"", we are using S and T which are very common. Also, we are testing R in the first position. If R is actually in the first position, we get a check. If not, then we know R must be in position 4 or 5.

In ""BOARD"", we are testing R in the fourth position.

We might also consider ""ROARS"" but that has duplicate R and S, which might not be as informative.

Another word: ""RASPS"" -> but has S twice and we don't know if S is in the word.

But let's stick to common words.

I think ""ROAST"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we can get a lot of information.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't have R in it? But wait, we know R is in the word, so we should use it to get position information. But we are allowed to not use R? However, if we don't use R, we won't get information about its position. So it's better to use R.

So I'll go with ""ROAST"".

But note: we are not forced to use R? Actually, we know R is in the word, so we should try to find its position. Therefore, we should include R in our next guess.

So, let's guess ""ROAST"".

But wait, what if the word has two R's? We don't know. But that's okay.

So, the next guess: ""ROAST""

We'll get feedback on:
- R in position 1: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, then we know R is in position 4 or 5 (because we know it's not in 2, and we are testing 1 now).
- O in position 2: we don't know about O, so we'll get feedback.
- A in position 3: we know it's correct, so we expect a check.
- S in position 4: new letter.
- T in position 5: new letter.

This should give us good information.

Therefore, I choose ""ROAST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""A"" is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- ""R"" is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- The 3rd letter must be ""A"".
- ""R"" must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1, 4, or 5 are possible).
- Avoid using ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"".
- To maximize information, include new common letters and test ""R"" in a new position.

The word ""roast"" fits these criteria:
- 3rd letter is ""A"".
- ""R"" is in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Avoids ""C"", ""N"", ""E"".
- Introduces new common letters: ""O"", ""S"", ""T"".

This guess will help identify the position of ""R"" and provide feedback on ""O"", ""S"", and ""T"".

Also, we are avoiding E, C, N? It doesn\'t have those. But it\'s a valid word.\n\n  However, we want to use distinct letters to maximize information? But if we use duplicate R, we might not get full information. But we know R is in the word, so if we put R in two positions, we might get feedback on both.\n\n  But since we are limited by the known constraints, let\'s try to avoid duplicates for now to cover more letters.\n\n  So ""ROAST"" is a good candidate: uses O, S, T which are common.\n\nOption 2: R in the fourth position: _ _ A R _\n  Words: ""STARL"" (not a word), ""SCARF"" (has C? C is not allowed because we know C is not in the word). We must avoid C.\n  ""ALTAR"": A (1), L (2), T (3) -> wait, we need A at position 3? No: in ""ALTAR"": A(1), L(2), T(3), A(4), R(5). So the third letter is T, not A. We need the third letter to be A.\n\n  So pattern: letter1, letter2, A, R, letter5.\n\n  Words: ""LIAR?"" -> but that\'s 4 letters. 5-letter words: ""GUARD"" -> G(1), U(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). This avoids C, N, E. But we haven\'t tested G, U, D.\n\n  ""HEARD"" -> but H, E: we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E. So avoid.\n\n  ""BOARD"": B(1), O(2), A(3), R(4), D(5) -> avoids C, N, E. Good.\n\n  ""HOARD"": same as above but H.\n\n  ""SOARE"" (a falconry term, not common) and has E -> avoid.\n\n  ""FJORD"": F(1), J(2), O(3) -> wait, third letter is O? We need A at third. So no.\n\n  So ""BOARD"" is a candidate: B, O, A, R, D.\n\nOption 3: R in the fifth position: _ _ A _ R\n  Words: ""PIZAR"" (not common), ""TUTAR"" (not a word), ""SONAR"" -> S(1), O(2), N(3) -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So avoid.\n  ""LARVA"": L(1), A(2), R(3) -> but we need A at position 3? No: A is at position 2. We need A at position 3.\n\n  Pattern: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, R.\n\n  Words: ""DEBAR"" -> D(1), E(2) -> E is not allowed. Avoid.\n  ""JUMAR"" (not common), ""COMA R"" -> but C is not allowed.\n\n  ""VAPOR"": V(1), A(2), P(3) -> no, we need A at position 3.\n\n  It\'s hard to find common words with R at the end and A at the third.\n\n  ""SUGAR"": S(1), U(2), G(3) -> but we need A at position 3? In ""SUGAR"": S(1), U(2), G(3), A(4), R(5). So the third letter is G, not A. \n\n  ""LUMAR"" (not common).\n\n  So maybe not many options for R at the end.\n\nTherefore, the two strong candidates are:\n1. ""ROAST"" (R at position 1, and then O, S, T)\n2. ""BOARD"" (R at position 4, and then B, O, D)\n\nWe can also consider putting R in the fourth position and use other letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2) -> no, we need A at position 3. So that\'s P(1), A(2), R(3) -> but we need A at 3, so that\'s not.\n\n""GRAPY"" (not a word).\n\n""TRAIN"": T(1), R(2) -> but we cannot put R in the second position because we already tried R in the second position and it was wrong (in ""crane"", R was in second and got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not in that position). So we must avoid putting R in the second position.\n\nTherefore, in ""TRAIN"", R is in the second position -> avoid.\n\nSo back to ""ROAST"" and ""BOARD"".\n\nWhich one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nIn ""ROAST"": we are testing R (which we know is present) in a new position (position 1), and then O, S, T. We also have A in the correct position (so we expect a check for A).\n\nIn ""BOARD"": we are testing B, O, D, and R in position 4 (which we haven\'t tried), and A in the correct position.\n\nBoth are good. But note that in ""ROAST"", we are using S and T which are very common. Also, we are testing R in the first position. If R is actually in the first position, we get a check. If not, then we know R must be in position 4 or 5.\n\nIn ""BOARD"", we are testing R in the fourth position.\n\nWe might also consider ""ROARS"" but that has duplicate R and S, which might not be as informative.\n\nAnother word: ""RASPS"" -> but has S twice and we don\'t know if S is in the word.\n\nBut let\'s stick to common words.\n\nI think ""ROAST"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we can get a lot of information.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t have R in it? But wait, we know R is in the word, so we should use it to get position information. But we are allowed to not use R? However, if we don\'t use R, we won\'t get information about its position. So it\'s better to use R.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ROAST"".\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use R? Actually, we know R is in the word, so we should try to find its position. Therefore, we should include R in our next guess.\n\nSo, let\'s guess ""ROAST"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word has two R\'s? We don\'t know. But that\'s okay.\n\nSo, the next guess: ""ROAST""\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on:\n- R in position 1: if it\'s correct, we get a check; if not, then we know R is in position 4 or 5 (because we know it\'s not in 2, and we are testing 1 now).\n- O in position 2: we don\'t know about O, so we\'ll get feedback.\n- A in position 3: we know it\'s correct, so we expect a check.\n- S in position 4: new letter.\n- T in position 5: new letter.\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""ROAST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- ""A"" is in the correct position (3rd letter).\n- ""R"" is in the word but not in the 2nd position.\n- ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The 3rd letter must be ""A"".\n- ""R"" must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1, 4, or 5 are possible).\n- Avoid using ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"".\n- To maximize information, include new common letters and test ""R"" in a new position.\n\nThe word ""roast"" fits these criteria:\n- 3rd letter is ""A"".\n- ""R"" is in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- Avoids ""C"", ""N"", ""E"".\n- Introduces new common letters: ""O"", ""S"", ""T"".\n\nThis guess will help identify the position of ""R"" and provide feedback on ""O"", ""S"", and ""T"".\n\n<guess>roast</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(-) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""roast""
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 1; so R is present but not in position 1 or 2)
- O: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- S: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- T: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The word has the letter 'A' in position 3 and 'T' in position 5. So the word pattern is: _ _ A _ T

2. The word contains the letters 'R' and 'S', but:
   - 'R' is not in position 1, 2 (and we know it's in the word, so it must be in position 4? But wait, position 5 is T, so R cannot be in position 5. Therefore, the only position left for R is position 4? But we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is A and 5 is T, so R must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But we have feedback that R is not in 1 (from roast) and not in 2 (from crane). Therefore, R must be in position 4.

   However, in guess 2, we put R in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not in position 1. We also know from guess 1 that R is not in position 2. And positions 3 and 5 are taken by A and T, so the only position left is 4. But in guess 2, we put S in position 4 and got a '-' for S, meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. So if R is in position 4, then when we put S in position 4, we would have gotten a different feedback? Actually, no: the feedback for S is independent. But we have:

   - R must be in the word and not in 1 or 2. The available positions are 4 (since 3 and 5 are fixed). So R must be in position 4.

   But wait, in guess 2, we have S in position 4 and we got a '-' for S, meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. That doesn't conflict with R being in position 4 because they are different letters. However, position 4 can only be one letter. So if R is in position 4, then S cannot be in position 4, which is consistent with the feedback. But the feedback for S says S is in the word but not in position 4, so S must be in one of the other positions: 1 or 2 (since 3 and 5 are fixed and taken by A and T).

   Therefore, we have:
   - Position 4 must be R? But we don't have direct evidence. Let's reexamine:

   We know:
   - The word has R (from both guesses) and it's not in position 1 (from roast) and not in position 2 (from crane). The only positions left are 4 (since 3 is A and 5 is T). So R must be in position 4.

   But in guess 2, we put R in position 1 and got a '-' (meaning R is present but not there) and we put S in position 4 and got a '-' (meaning S is present but not there). If R is in position 4, then when we put S in position 4, we would have expected an 'x' for S if S is not in the word, but we got a '-' meaning S is in the word but not in that position. So that is consistent: R is in position 4, and S is in the word but not in position 4 (so S must be in position 1 or 2).

   However, we have a conflict? Because if R is in position 4, then the letter in position 4 is R, so when we put S in position 4, it should be wrong and we should get an 'x' for S if S is not in the word, but we got a '-' meaning S is in the word. So that implies that S is in the word, but not in position 4. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2.

   And R must be in position 4 because that's the only position left.

   So we can conclude:
   - Position 4 is R.

   But wait, we haven't tested position 4 with R. We only know that R is in the word and the only available position is 4. So we can deduce that position 4 must be R.

   Therefore, the word so far is: _ _ A R T

   And we also know that S is in the word and must be in position 1 or 2.

   Additionally, we have:
   - O is not in the word (from roast: O(x))
   - C, N, E are not in the word (from crane)

   So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] A R T

   Where letter1 and letter2 are to be determined, and one of them must be S (because S is in the word and the only positions left are 1 and 2).

   Also, we know that the word does not contain: C, E, N, O.

   Now, we need to find a word that fits: _ _ A R T, with one of the first two letters being S, and the other being a letter not in {C, E, N, O} and not S (if we assume no duplicates? But we don't know about duplicates. However, we have no indication of duplicates so far, so we can assume no duplicates for now).

   But note: we have two positions and we know S is one of them. So the word is either:
   - S _ A R T -> but then the second letter is missing, so it must be a letter that forms a word: S?ART
   - or _ S A R T -> ?SART

   We need to find 5-letter words that end with ""ART"", but note the pattern is _ _ART, and the first two letters: one is S and the other is an unknown.

   Actually, the pattern is: [letter1][letter2]ART

   And one of letter1 or letter2 is S.

   So possibilities:
   - If S is in position 1: then the word is S X A R T, where X is a letter (not C, E, N, O, and not S because we assume no duplicate? But we don't know, so we should consider duplicates? However, we haven't encountered duplicates so far, and we have no feedback suggesting duplicates. So let's first assume no duplicates. Then X cannot be S, and also cannot be A, R, T (because they are already in the word). So X must be a new letter.

   - If S is in position 2: then the word is X S A R T, with X not in {C, E, N, O, A, R, T, S} (if no duplicates).

   Now, let's list possible words:

   Option 1: S in position 1 -> S _ A R T
     Possible words: 
        SMART -> S M A R T -> M is not in the forbidden list? Forbidden: C, E, N, O. M is allowed.
        START -> S T A R T -> but T is already in position 5? And we have T in position 5, but if we put T in position 2, that would be a duplicate T? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback for ""roast"", we had T in position 5 and got a check, meaning the T is in position 5. If the word were ""START"", then it has two T's: one in position 2 and one in position 5. But we haven't tested for duplicates. The feedback for ""roast"" only showed one T (the one in position 5) and it was correct. If there were a T in position 2, we wouldn't know because we didn't have a T in position 2 in any guess. So ""START"" is a possibility? But we have to check the feedback we got.

        However, in ""roast"", we had T in position 5 and it was correct. We didn't have any T in position 2. So if the word is ""START"", then when we guessed ""roast"", we had:
          Position 1: R (which is not in the word in position 1, but in position 4) -> '-'
          Position 2: O (not in the word) -> 'x'
          Position 3: A (correct) -> '✓'
          Position 4: S (which is in the word but not in position 4; in ""START"", S is in position 1, so it should be a '-' for S, which we got)
          Position 5: T (correct) -> '✓'

        So ""START"" is consistent with the feedback? But wait, in ""START"", the letter S is in position 1, but in our guess ""roast"", we put S in position 4. The feedback for S was '-' meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. That matches because in ""START"", S is in position 1.

        However, we also have to consider the first guess ""crane"": 
          ""crane"" for ""START"": 
            C (x) -> correct, not in word
            R (in position 2 of crane, but in ""START"" R is in position 4) -> so R is present but not in position 2 -> '-' which matches
            A (in position 3) -> correct -> '✓' matches
            N (x) -> not in word -> matches
            E (x) -> not in word -> matches

        So ""START"" is a candidate.

        But note: in ""START"", the letter T appears twice? But we don't have feedback about duplicate T. However, the feedback for ""roast"" only showed one T (the one in position 5) and it was correct. The T in position 2 of ""START"" was not tested in any guess, so it's possible.

        But we must also consider: we have feedback that R is in the word and we deduced it must be in position 4. In ""START"", R is in position 4, so that matches.

        However, we also have the letter S: in ""START"", S is in position 1. And we have feedback that S is in the word (from roast) and not in position 4, which is true.

        So ""START"" is a candidate.

        But what about the second letter? In ""START"", the second letter is T. We don't have any feedback about T in position 2. But we know T is in position 5, and if there is another T in position 2, that's a duplicate. The game allows duplicates? The rules don't say the word must have distinct letters, so duplicates are possible.

        Alternatively, we have ""SMART"": S M A R T. 
        In ""SMART"", the letters are S, M, A, R, T. 
        Check against feedback:
          For ""roast"": 
            R in position 1: but in ""SMART"", R is in position 4 -> so R is present but not in 1 -> '-' 
            O: not in word -> 'x'
            A: correct -> '✓'
            S: in position 4 of roast, but in ""SMART"" S is in position 1 -> so S is present but not in 4 -> '-' 
            T: in position 5 -> '✓'
          So that matches.

        Also, for ""crane"": same as above, it matches.

        So both ""START"" and ""SMART"" are candidates.

   Option 2: S in position 2 -> _ S A R T
     Possible words: 
        We need a letter for the first position. The word would be X S A R T.
        Common words: not many. 
        ""USART"" is not a word.
        ""ISART"" not a word.
        ""ESART"" not a word.
        ""ASTART"" is 6 letters.
        Actually, I can't think of a common English word that ends with ""SART"". 

        Let me check: 
          We have words like ""ASSART"" but that has two S's and is 6 letters? 
          Or ""DISART"" not a word.

        So probably no common word with the pattern _ S A R T.

        Therefore, the only possibilities are with S in position 1: so words starting with S and ending with ART, but with 5 letters: so S?ART, where ? is a letter.

        We have:
          SMART (M)
          START (T) -> but duplicate T?
          SWART (meaning dark, but less common) -> W
          SPART (a type of fiber, not common) -> P
          SCART (a connector, but we know C is not in the word) -> invalid because C is not allowed.

        So the common ones are ""SMART"" and ""START"".

        We also have ""SHART"", but that's informal and might not be in the word list.

        So we have two main candidates: ""SMART"" and ""START"".

        How to distinguish? We need to make a guess that can test the second position.

        We know that in ""START"", the second letter is T, and in ""SMART"", the second letter is M.

        We also know that we haven't tested M or T in the second position.

        We can make a guess that includes one of these and tests the positions.

        But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try to guess one of these.

        Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses both possibilities? But we have to choose one word.

        However, we can also consider that we have to fill the first two positions. We know S must be in one of them, and we think it's position 1. So we can guess ""SMART"" and if it's not that, then ""START""?

        But we have to make one guess.

        Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests the second position without committing to one of these.

        But we have the pattern: _ _ A R T, and we know S is in the first or second. We already think it's first, so let's assume that and then test the second position.

        We can guess a word that has:
          Position 1: S (because we think it's S)
          Position 2: a letter that we haven't used and is common, but we don't have many letters left to test? 

        But we are going to guess the whole word.

        Since we have two strong candidates, we can choose one. Let's choose the more common word.

        ""START"" is a very common word, and ""SMART"" is also common.

        But note: in ""START"", we have a duplicate T? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. The rules don't prohibit duplicates, so it's possible.

        However, we can look at the feedback: in the first guess, we had T? No, we didn't have T in ""crane"". In the second guess, we had T in position 5 and it was correct. But we didn't have T in any other position.

        So we don't have information about a second T.

        How can we get more information without guessing one of the candidates? We could guess a word that has different letters in the first two positions to test.

        For example, we can guess a word that has the pattern: S _ A R T, but with a letter in the second position that is not M or T? But then it wouldn't be a real word? We have to guess a valid word.

        Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the same pattern but with a different set of letters to test for the presence of M or T in the second position.

        But we know the second position must be filled by a letter that is not in the forbidden list and not A, R, T (if we assume no duplicate) or if duplicates are allowed, then it could be T.

        We can try to guess ""SMART"" and see.

        But we are allowed to guess the word. If we guess ""SMART"" and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that tells us.

        Similarly for ""START"".

        However, we have to consider that there might be other words. For example, ""SWART"" (which means dark or swarthy) is a word, but less common.

        Given that, I think the two most common are ""START"" and ""SMART"". 

        We can also consider ""SPART"", but that's not common and we don't know if it's in the word list.

        So let's choose between ""START"" and ""SMART"".

        How about we consider the feedback we have: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was present but not there. In the second guess, we had R in position 1 and it was present but not there. We deduced R is in position 4.

        Now, if we guess ""SMART"", we are putting M in position 2. We haven't tested M before. If the word is ""START"", then we will get feedback that M is not in the word (x) and S is in position 1 (so we get a check for S? But wait, in ""START"", S is in position 1, so if we guess ""SMART"", then:

          Position 1: S -> in ""START"", S is in position 1 -> ✓
          Position 2: M -> not in ""START"" -> x
          Position 3: A -> ✓
          Position 4: R -> in ""START"", R is in position 4 -> ✓
          Position 5: T -> ✓

        So we would get: S(✓) M(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) -> so we know the word is S _ A R T, and the second letter is not M. Then we can guess ""START"" next.

        Similarly, if we guess ""START"", and the word is ""SMART"", then:

          Position 1: S -> ✓
          Position 2: T -> in ""SMART"", the second letter is M, so T is not in the word? But wait, in ""SMART"", there is a T at the end, but we are putting T in position 2. So for ""START"" guessed against ""SMART"":
            S: position 1: in ""SMART"" is S? -> ✓
            T: position 2: in ""SMART"" there is no T in position 2, and there is a T in position 5. But we have to check: is T present elsewhere? The feedback for T would be: since T is in the word but not in position 2, we would get a '-' for T? But wait, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but not in that position, we get '-'. But in ""SMART"", there is one T at the end. So when we put T in position 2, it is not in the word in that position, but it is in the word in position 5. So we should get a '-' for T in position 2.

          So:
            S(✓) T(-) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) -> but wait, we have two T's in the guess? The feedback for the second T: we have T in position 5 and it is correct (because ""SMART"" has T in position 5) -> ✓. But the T in position 2: since there is a T in the word (at position 5) but not in position 2, we get '-'.

          So the feedback would be: S(✓), T(-), A(✓), R(✓), T(✓)

          This would tell us that T is in the word but not in position 2, and we know T is in position 5 (from the last T). Then we would know the second letter is not T, so we can guess ""SMART"" next.

        Therefore, in either case, we can guess one of them and then the next guess will be the other.

        But we are on the third guess, and we have 4 more guesses, so it's safe.

        However, we might get it right on the third guess.

        Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that doesn't commit to either but tests the second position.

        For example, we can guess a word that has the pattern: _ _ A R T, but with the first two letters being letters we haven't tried, but that is difficult because we don't know many words.

        Or we can guess a word that has M in the second position and T in the first? But that might not be the pattern.

        Another idea: guess a word that has M and T in it, but not necessarily in the first two positions? But we are constrained by the known positions.

        We know the pattern: _ _ A R T, so we must have A in 3, R in 4, T in 5.

        So we can only vary the first two.

        We can guess ""SMART"" to test M in the second position.

        Since ""SMART"" is a common word, I'll go with that.

        But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, E, N, O.

        ""SMART"" uses S, M, A, R, T -> all allowed.

        So let's guess ""SMART"".

        If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that tells us the second letter is not M, so it must be T (in ""START"") or something else (like W in ""SWART"", but less common).

        But we'll handle that in the next guess.

        Alternatively, we can guess ""START"" first. But I think ""SMART"" is a good choice.

        However, let me check the frequency: ""START"" is more common? But both are common.

        I'll go with ""SMART"".

        But wait, we have feedback that S is in the word and we think it's in position 1. In ""SMART"", we put S in position 1, so if it's correct, we get a check.

        So:

        Guess: ""SMART""

        If the word is ""SMART"", we get all correct.

        If the word is ""START"", we get: 
          S(✓) M(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓)

        Then we know the second letter is not M, so we can guess ""START"" next.

        If the word is ""SWART"", we get: 
          S(✓) W(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) -> then we know it's not M, and we can try other letters for the second position.

        But ""SWART"" is less common, so we might try ""START"" next and then if that fails, try ""SWART"".

        Given the above, I think ""SMART"" is a good guess.

        But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have room.

        Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that tests multiple possibilities for the second letter? But we have to stick to the pattern.

        Another candidate: ""SHART"" (but informal) or ""SPART"" (not common). So we'll stick with ""SMART"".

        Therefore, I choose ""SMART"".

        But wait, what if the word is not in the pattern we deduced? We are confident that position 4 is R? Let me double-check.

        We know:
          - R is in the word (from both guesses).
          - R is not in position 1 (from roast: R in position 1 got '-')
          - R is not in position 2 (from crane: R in position 2 got '-')
          - The only positions left are 4 (since 3 is A and 5 is T, and 1 and 2 are open but we just ruled them out for R). So R must be in position 4.

        Therefore, the pattern is fixed: _ _ A R T.

        And S must be in position 1 or 2. And we have no other candidates for position 1 or 2 that are common besides S and then M or T.

        So I think we are safe.

        Let's go with ""SMART"".

        But note: in the feedback for ""roast"", we had S in position 4 and got a '-', meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. That doesn't tell us where S is, but we deduced it must be in 1 or 2. And we are putting S in position 1 in ""SMART"", which is a candidate.

        So, the next guess is ""SMART"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - C (x) not in word  
  - R (-) in word but wrong position (not position 2)  
  - A (✓) correct position (position 3)  
  - N (x) not in word  
  - E (x) not in word  

- **Guess 2 (roast)**:  
  - R (-) in word but wrong position (not position 1 or 2)  
  - O (x) not in word  
  - A (✓) correct position (position 3)  
  - S (-) in word but wrong position (not position 4)  
  - T (✓) correct position (position 5)  

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 3 is **A** (from both guesses).  
   - Position 5 is **T** (from ""roast"").  
   
2. **Present letters (wrong positions)**:  
   - **R** is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 4 is now reserved for R based on deduction below).  
     - *Why position 4?* R must be in the word, and the only remaining position is 4 (positions 3 and 5 are fixed, and positions 1/2 are ruled out by feedback).  
   - **S** is in the word but not in position 4. Since positions 3 and 5 are fixed, S must be in position 1 or 2.  

3. **Absent letters**: C, E, N, O (cannot appear in the word).  

4. **Word pattern**:  
   - The word must match `_ _ A R T` (positions: 3=A, 4=R, 5=T).  
   - One of the first two positions (1 or 2) must be **S**.  

### Analysis for next guess:
- The pattern `_ _ A R T` with **S** in position 1 or 2 leaves two likely candidates:  
  - **SMART**: S in position 1, M in position 2.  
  - **START**: S in position 1, T in position 2 (duplicate T, allowed in Wordle).  
- Testing **SMART** is strategic:  
  - If correct, the game ends.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on position 2 (M) will confirm if it’s absent (x), narrowing the solution to **START** or less common words like **SWART**.  

**Next guess**: ""SMART"" (tests S in position 1 and M in position 2, while respecting all constraints).  

<guess>smart</guess>",smart,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""roast""
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 1; so R is present but not in position 1 or 2)
- O: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- S: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- T: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The word has the letter 'A' in position 3 and 'T' in position 5. So the word pattern is: _ _ A _ T

2. The word contains the letters 'R' and 'S', but:
   - 'R' is not in position 1, 2 (and we know it's in the word, so it must be in position 4? But wait, position 5 is T, so R cannot be in position 5. Therefore, the only position left for R is position 4? But we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is A and 5 is T, so R must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But we have feedback that R is not in 1 (from roast) and not in 2 (from crane). Therefore, R must be in position 4.

   However, in guess 2, we put R in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not in position 1. We also know from guess 1 that R is not in position 2. And positions 3 and 5 are taken by A and T, so the only position left is 4. But in guess 2, we put S in position 4 and got a '-' for S, meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. So if R is in position 4, then when we put S in position 4, we would have gotten a different feedback? Actually, no: the feedback for S is independent. But we have:

   - R must be in the word and not in 1 or 2. The available positions are 4 (since 3 and 5 are fixed). So R must be in position 4.

   But wait, in guess 2, we have S in position 4 and we got a '-' for S, meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. That doesn't conflict with R being in position 4 because they are different letters. However, position 4 can only be one letter. So if R is in position 4, then S cannot be in position 4, which is consistent with the feedback. But the feedback for S says S is in the word but not in position 4, so S must be in one of the other positions: 1 or 2 (since 3 and 5 are fixed and taken by A and T).

   Therefore, we have:
   - Position 4 must be R? But we don't have direct evidence. Let's reexamine:

   We know:
   - The word has R (from both guesses) and it's not in position 1 (from roast) and not in position 2 (from crane). The only positions left are 4 (since 3 is A and 5 is T). So R must be in position 4.

   But in guess 2, we put R in position 1 and got a '-' (meaning R is present but not there) and we put S in position 4 and got a '-' (meaning S is present but not there). If R is in position 4, then when we put S in position 4, we would have expected an 'x' for S if S is not in the word, but we got a '-' meaning S is in the word but not in that position. So that is consistent: R is in position 4, and S is in the word but not in position 4 (so S must be in position 1 or 2).

   However, we have a conflict? Because if R is in position 4, then the letter in position 4 is R, so when we put S in position 4, it should be wrong and we should get an 'x' for S if S is not in the word, but we got a '-' meaning S is in the word. So that implies that S is in the word, but not in position 4. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2.

   And R must be in position 4 because that's the only position left.

   So we can conclude:
   - Position 4 is R.

   But wait, we haven't tested position 4 with R. We only know that R is in the word and the only available position is 4. So we can deduce that position 4 must be R.

   Therefore, the word so far is: _ _ A R T

   And we also know that S is in the word and must be in position 1 or 2.

   Additionally, we have:
   - O is not in the word (from roast: O(x))
   - C, N, E are not in the word (from crane)

   So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] A R T

   Where letter1 and letter2 are to be determined, and one of them must be S (because S is in the word and the only positions left are 1 and 2).

   Also, we know that the word does not contain: C, E, N, O.

   Now, we need to find a word that fits: _ _ A R T, with one of the first two letters being S, and the other being a letter not in {C, E, N, O} and not S (if we assume no duplicates? But we don't know about duplicates. However, we have no indication of duplicates so far, so we can assume no duplicates for now).

   But note: we have two positions and we know S is one of them. So the word is either:
   - S _ A R T -> but then the second letter is missing, so it must be a letter that forms a word: S?ART
   - or _ S A R T -> ?SART

   We need to find 5-letter words that end with ""ART"", but note the pattern is _ _ART, and the first two letters: one is S and the other is an unknown.

   Actually, the pattern is: [letter1][letter2]ART

   And one of letter1 or letter2 is S.

   So possibilities:
   - If S is in position 1: then the word is S X A R T, where X is a letter (not C, E, N, O, and not S because we assume no duplicate? But we don't know, so we should consider duplicates? However, we haven't encountered duplicates so far, and we have no feedback suggesting duplicates. So let's first assume no duplicates. Then X cannot be S, and also cannot be A, R, T (because they are already in the word). So X must be a new letter.

   - If S is in position 2: then the word is X S A R T, with X not in {C, E, N, O, A, R, T, S} (if no duplicates).

   Now, let's list possible words:

   Option 1: S in position 1 -> S _ A R T
     Possible words: 
        SMART -> S M A R T -> M is not in the forbidden list? Forbidden: C, E, N, O. M is allowed.
        START -> S T A R T -> but T is already in position 5? And we have T in position 5, but if we put T in position 2, that would be a duplicate T? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback for ""roast"", we had T in position 5 and got a check, meaning the T is in position 5. If the word were ""START"", then it has two T's: one in position 2 and one in position 5. But we haven't tested for duplicates. The feedback for ""roast"" only showed one T (the one in position 5) and it was correct. If there were a T in position 2, we wouldn't know because we didn't have a T in position 2 in any guess. So ""START"" is a possibility? But we have to check the feedback we got.

        However, in ""roast"", we had T in position 5 and it was correct. We didn't have any T in position 2. So if the word is ""START"", then when we guessed ""roast"", we had:
          Position 1: R (which is not in the word in position 1, but in position 4) -> '-'
          Position 2: O (not in the word) -> 'x'
          Position 3: A (correct) -> '✓'
          Position 4: S (which is in the word but not in position 4; in ""START"", S is in position 1, so it should be a '-' for S, which we got)
          Position 5: T (correct) -> '✓'

        So ""START"" is consistent with the feedback? But wait, in ""START"", the letter S is in position 1, but in our guess ""roast"", we put S in position 4. The feedback for S was '-' meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. That matches because in ""START"", S is in position 1.

        However, we also have to consider the first guess ""crane"": 
          ""crane"" for ""START"": 
            C (x) -> correct, not in word
            R (in position 2 of crane, but in ""START"" R is in position 4) -> so R is present but not in position 2 -> '-' which matches
            A (in position 3) -> correct -> '✓' matches
            N (x) -> not in word -> matches
            E (x) -> not in word -> matches

        So ""START"" is a candidate.

        But note: in ""START"", the letter T appears twice? But we don't have feedback about duplicate T. However, the feedback for ""roast"" only showed one T (the one in position 5) and it was correct. The T in position 2 of ""START"" was not tested in any guess, so it's possible.

        But we must also consider: we have feedback that R is in the word and we deduced it must be in position 4. In ""START"", R is in position 4, so that matches.

        However, we also have the letter S: in ""START"", S is in position 1. And we have feedback that S is in the word (from roast) and not in position 4, which is true.

        So ""START"" is a candidate.

        But what about the second letter? In ""START"", the second letter is T. We don't have any feedback about T in position 2. But we know T is in position 5, and if there is another T in position 2, that's a duplicate. The game allows duplicates? The rules don't say the word must have distinct letters, so duplicates are possible.

        Alternatively, we have ""SMART"": S M A R T. 
        In ""SMART"", the letters are S, M, A, R, T. 
        Check against feedback:
          For ""roast"": 
            R in position 1: but in ""SMART"", R is in position 4 -> so R is present but not in 1 -> '-' 
            O: not in word -> 'x'
            A: correct -> '✓'
            S: in position 4 of roast, but in ""SMART"" S is in position 1 -> so S is present but not in 4 -> '-' 
            T: in position 5 -> '✓'
          So that matches.

        Also, for ""crane"": same as above, it matches.

        So both ""START"" and ""SMART"" are candidates.

   Option 2: S in position 2 -> _ S A R T
     Possible words: 
        We need a letter for the first position. The word would be X S A R T.
        Common words: not many. 
        ""USART"" is not a word.
        ""ISART"" not a word.
        ""ESART"" not a word.
        ""ASTART"" is 6 letters.
        Actually, I can't think of a common English word that ends with ""SART"". 

        Let me check: 
          We have words like ""ASSART"" but that has two S's and is 6 letters? 
          Or ""DISART"" not a word.

        So probably no common word with the pattern _ S A R T.

        Therefore, the only possibilities are with S in position 1: so words starting with S and ending with ART, but with 5 letters: so S?ART, where ? is a letter.

        We have:
          SMART (M)
          START (T) -> but duplicate T?
          SWART (meaning dark, but less common) -> W
          SPART (a type of fiber, not common) -> P
          SCART (a connector, but we know C is not in the word) -> invalid because C is not allowed.

        So the common ones are ""SMART"" and ""START"".

        We also have ""SHART"", but that's informal and might not be in the word list.

        So we have two main candidates: ""SMART"" and ""START"".

        How to distinguish? We need to make a guess that can test the second position.

        We know that in ""START"", the second letter is T, and in ""SMART"", the second letter is M.

        We also know that we haven't tested M or T in the second position.

        We can make a guess that includes one of these and tests the positions.

        But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try to guess one of these.

        Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses both possibilities? But we have to choose one word.

        However, we can also consider that we have to fill the first two positions. We know S must be in one of them, and we think it's position 1. So we can guess ""SMART"" and if it's not that, then ""START""?

        But we have to make one guess.

        Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests the second position without committing to one of these.

        But we have the pattern: _ _ A R T, and we know S is in the first or second. We already think it's first, so let's assume that and then test the second position.

        We can guess a word that has:
          Position 1: S (because we think it's S)
          Position 2: a letter that we haven't used and is common, but we don't have many letters left to test? 

        But we are going to guess the whole word.

        Since we have two strong candidates, we can choose one. Let's choose the more common word.

        ""START"" is a very common word, and ""SMART"" is also common.

        But note: in ""START"", we have a duplicate T? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. The rules don't prohibit duplicates, so it's possible.

        However, we can look at the feedback: in the first guess, we had T? No, we didn't have T in ""crane"". In the second guess, we had T in position 5 and it was correct. But we didn't have T in any other position.

        So we don't have information about a second T.

        How can we get more information without guessing one of the candidates? We could guess a word that has different letters in the first two positions to test.

        For example, we can guess a word that has the pattern: S _ A R T, but with a letter in the second position that is not M or T? But then it wouldn't be a real word? We have to guess a valid word.

        Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the same pattern but with a different set of letters to test for the presence of M or T in the second position.

        But we know the second position must be filled by a letter that is not in the forbidden list and not A, R, T (if we assume no duplicate) or if duplicates are allowed, then it could be T.

        We can try to guess ""SMART"" and see.

        But we are allowed to guess the word. If we guess ""SMART"" and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that tells us.

        Similarly for ""START"".

        However, we have to consider that there might be other words. For example, ""SWART"" (which means dark or swarthy) is a word, but less common.

        Given that, I think the two most common are ""START"" and ""SMART"". 

        We can also consider ""SPART"", but that's not common and we don't know if it's in the word list.

        So let's choose between ""START"" and ""SMART"".

        How about we consider the feedback we have: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was present but not there. In the second guess, we had R in position 1 and it was present but not there. We deduced R is in position 4.

        Now, if we guess ""SMART"", we are putting M in position 2. We haven't tested M before. If the word is ""START"", then we will get feedback that M is not in the word (x) and S is in position 1 (so we get a check for S? But wait, in ""START"", S is in position 1, so if we guess ""SMART"", then:

          Position 1: S -> in ""START"", S is in position 1 -> ✓
          Position 2: M -> not in ""START"" -> x
          Position 3: A -> ✓
          Position 4: R -> in ""START"", R is in position 4 -> ✓
          Position 5: T -> ✓

        So we would get: S(✓) M(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) -> so we know the word is S _ A R T, and the second letter is not M. Then we can guess ""START"" next.

        Similarly, if we guess ""START"", and the word is ""SMART"", then:

          Position 1: S -> ✓
          Position 2: T -> in ""SMART"", the second letter is M, so T is not in the word? But wait, in ""SMART"", there is a T at the end, but we are putting T in position 2. So for ""START"" guessed against ""SMART"":
            S: position 1: in ""SMART"" is S? -> ✓
            T: position 2: in ""SMART"" there is no T in position 2, and there is a T in position 5. But we have to check: is T present elsewhere? The feedback for T would be: since T is in the word but not in position 2, we would get a '-' for T? But wait, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but not in that position, we get '-'. But in ""SMART"", there is one T at the end. So when we put T in position 2, it is not in the word in that position, but it is in the word in position 5. So we should get a '-' for T in position 2.

          So:
            S(✓) T(-) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) -> but wait, we have two T's in the guess? The feedback for the second T: we have T in position 5 and it is correct (because ""SMART"" has T in position 5) -> ✓. But the T in position 2: since there is a T in the word (at position 5) but not in position 2, we get '-'.

          So the feedback would be: S(✓), T(-), A(✓), R(✓), T(✓)

          This would tell us that T is in the word but not in position 2, and we know T is in position 5 (from the last T). Then we would know the second letter is not T, so we can guess ""SMART"" next.

        Therefore, in either case, we can guess one of them and then the next guess will be the other.

        But we are on the third guess, and we have 4 more guesses, so it's safe.

        However, we might get it right on the third guess.

        Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that doesn't commit to either but tests the second position.

        For example, we can guess a word that has the pattern: _ _ A R T, but with the first two letters being letters we haven't tried, but that is difficult because we don't know many words.

        Or we can guess a word that has M in the second position and T in the first? But that might not be the pattern.

        Another idea: guess a word that has M and T in it, but not necessarily in the first two positions? But we are constrained by the known positions.

        We know the pattern: _ _ A R T, so we must have A in 3, R in 4, T in 5.

        So we can only vary the first two.

        We can guess ""SMART"" to test M in the second position.

        Since ""SMART"" is a common word, I'll go with that.

        But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, E, N, O.

        ""SMART"" uses S, M, A, R, T -> all allowed.

        So let's guess ""SMART"".

        If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that tells us the second letter is not M, so it must be T (in ""START"") or something else (like W in ""SWART"", but less common).

        But we'll handle that in the next guess.

        Alternatively, we can guess ""START"" first. But I think ""SMART"" is a good choice.

        However, let me check the frequency: ""START"" is more common? But both are common.

        I'll go with ""SMART"".

        But wait, we have feedback that S is in the word and we think it's in position 1. In ""SMART"", we put S in position 1, so if it's correct, we get a check.

        So:

        Guess: ""SMART""

        If the word is ""SMART"", we get all correct.

        If the word is ""START"", we get: 
          S(✓) M(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓)

        Then we know the second letter is not M, so we can guess ""START"" next.

        If the word is ""SWART"", we get: 
          S(✓) W(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) -> then we know it's not M, and we can try other letters for the second position.

        But ""SWART"" is less common, so we might try ""START"" next and then if that fails, try ""SWART"".

        Given the above, I think ""SMART"" is a good guess.

        But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have room.

        Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that tests multiple possibilities for the second letter? But we have to stick to the pattern.

        Another candidate: ""SHART"" (but informal) or ""SPART"" (not common). So we'll stick with ""SMART"".

        Therefore, I choose ""SMART"".

        But wait, what if the word is not in the pattern we deduced? We are confident that position 4 is R? Let me double-check.

        We know:
          - R is in the word (from both guesses).
          - R is not in position 1 (from roast: R in position 1 got '-')
          - R is not in position 2 (from crane: R in position 2 got '-')
          - The only positions left are 4 (since 3 is A and 5 is T, and 1 and 2 are open but we just ruled them out for R). So R must be in position 4.

        Therefore, the pattern is fixed: _ _ A R T.

        And S must be in position 1 or 2. And we have no other candidates for position 1 or 2 that are common besides S and then M or T.

        So I think we are safe.

        Let's go with ""SMART"".

        But note: in the feedback for ""roast"", we had S in position 4 and got a '-', meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. That doesn't tell us where S is, but we deduced it must be in 1 or 2. And we are putting S in position 1 in ""SMART"", which is a candidate.

        So, the next guess is ""SMART"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - C (x) not in word  
  - R (-) in word but wrong position (not position 2)  
  - A (✓) correct position (position 3)  
  - N (x) not in word  
  - E (x) not in word  

- **Guess 2 (roast)**:  
  - R (-) in word but wrong position (not position 1 or 2)  
  - O (x) not in word  
  - A (✓) correct position (position 3)  
  - S (-) in word but wrong position (not position 4)  
  - T (✓) correct position (position 5)  

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 3 is **A** (from both guesses).  
   - Position 5 is **T** (from ""roast"").  
   
2. **Present letters (wrong positions)**:  
   - **R** is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 4 is now reserved for R based on deduction below).  
     - *Why position 4?* R must be in the word, and the only remaining position is 4 (positions 3 and 5 are fixed, and positions 1/2 are ruled out by feedback).  
   - **S** is in the word but not in position 4. Since positions 3 and 5 are fixed, S must be in position 1 or 2.  

3. **Absent letters**: C, E, N, O (cannot appear in the word).  

4. **Word pattern**:  
   - The word must match `_ _ A R T` (positions: 3=A, 4=R, 5=T).  
   - One of the first two positions (1 or 2) must be **S**.  

### Analysis for next guess:
- The pattern `_ _ A R T` with **S** in position 1 or 2 leaves two likely candidates:  
  - **SMART**: S in position 1, M in position 2.  
  - **START**: S in position 1, T in position 2 (duplicate T, allowed in Wordle).  
- Testing **SMART** is strategic:  
  - If correct, the game ends.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on position 2 (M) will confirm if it’s absent (x), narrowing the solution to **START** or less common words like **SWART**.  

**Next guess**: ""SMART"" (tests S in position 1 and M in position 2, while respecting all constraints).",Guess 3: smart -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the word and is in the correct position (3rd letter, since positions are 1-indexed: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5). Therefore, the 3rd letter of the secret word is 'A'.
- The letter 'R' is in the word but not in the 2nd position. So it must be in one of the other positions: 1, 4, or 5 (but note that position 3 is taken by 'A').
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all. So we must avoid using these letters in future guesses.

We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long and is an English word.

For our next guess, we should:
1. Include the letter 'A' in the 3rd position.
2. Include the letter 'R' but not in the 2nd position (so it could be in position 1, 4, or 5).
3. Avoid using the letters C, N, and E.

We want to maximize the information we get by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have:
- 'A' as the third letter
- 'R' somewhere else (position 1, 4, or 5)
- Avoid C, N, E

Also, we should try to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet to get more feedback.

Common consonants we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we avoid C, N, E).

We can try to use a word that has 'R' in the first position? Or maybe in the fourth or fifth.

Let's consider words with the pattern: _ _ A _ _

We know the word must contain an 'R' (but not in the second position). So possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5.

We also want to test other common letters. For example, we might try to include S, T, L, etc.

Possible words:
- If we put R in the first position: R _ A _ _
  - Examples: ""RADAR"" (but has R in first and last, and A in third and fifth? But we know A is only in third? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. The secret word might have two A's? But in our feedback, we only have one A and it was correct. However, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters unless we guess them. So we must be cautious. But in this case, we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven't ruled out duplicates. But for now, let's avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one A and it was correct. If the word had two A's, but we only guessed one, then we wouldn't know about the other. Similarly, for R, we only know there's at least one R.

So, let's try to form a word that has R in a new position and uses new letters.

Idea: put R in the first position and use common letters for the rest.

Word: ""RATIO"" -> but that has T and I and O, which are new. However, the pattern would be R A T I O? But wait, we need the third letter to be A. In ""RATIO"", the third letter is T, not A. So that doesn't work.

We need the third letter to be A. So the pattern is: _ _ A _ _

With R in the first position: R _ A _ _

Possible words: 
- ""ROAST"": R O A S T -> but O, S, T are new. However, we have to avoid E, C, N. This seems okay. But note: the second letter is O, which we haven't tried. Also, we have S and T.

But wait, in ""ROAST"", the third letter is A? Yes: positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T.

But we also have the constraint that R is not in the second position? Actually, in this word, R is in the first, which is fine. And we are including R, which we know is in the word.

Alternatively, we could put R in the fourth position: _ _ A R _
Or fifth: _ _ A _ R

But let's think about what we can test. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common starting approach is to try a word that uses the known correct letter and the known present letter, and then three new letters.

So, let's try to form a word with:
- Position 3: A
- R in either 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2, because we already tried R in position 2 and it was wrong).

We also want to avoid C, N, E.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and include R and avoid C, N, E.

Option 1: R in position 1 -> R _ A _ _
  Words: ""ROAST"", ""RABAT"" (not common), ""RADAR"" (has two R's and two A's, but we don't know about duplicates), ""RAPID"", ""RASPY"", ""RAYON"" (has N, which is bad because we know N is not in the word). So we avoid words with N.

  ""ROAST"": R O A S T -> no C, N, E. Good.
  ""RAPID"": R A P I D -> but wait, the third letter is P? No: R (1), A (2), P (3) -> so that doesn't have A in the third. We need the third letter to be A.

  Actually, for ""RAPID"": 
    Position 1: R
    Position 2: A
    Position 3: P -> so that's not A in the third. We need the third letter to be A.

  So we must have the pattern: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.

  Therefore, for R in first: R (letter1), then any letter for letter2 (but not R because we don't want to repeat unless necessary? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed), then A (third), then two more.

  So ""ROAST"": R (1), O (2), A (3), S (4), T (5) -> valid.

  Similarly, ""RALLY"": R (1), A (2) -> wait, no: R (1), A (2), L (3) -> but we need A at position 3. So that's not.

  Another: ""REAST"" (archaic, not common) -> avoid.

  ""ROARS"": R (1), O (2), A (3), R (4), S (5) -> but has two R's? And we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we are avoiding E, C, N? It doesn't have those. But it's a valid word.

  However, we want to use distinct letters to maximize information? But if we use duplicate R, we might not get full information. But we know R is in the word, so if we put R in two positions, we might get feedback on both.

  But since we are limited by the known constraints, let's try to avoid duplicates for now to cover more letters.

  So ""ROAST"" is a good candidate: uses O, S, T which are common.

Option 2: R in the fourth position: _ _ A R _
  Words: ""STARL"" (not a word), ""SCARF"" (has C? C is not allowed because we know C is not in the word). We must avoid C.
  ""ALTAR"": A (1), L (2), T (3) -> wait, we need A at position 3? No: in ""ALTAR"": A(1), L(2), T(3), A(4), R(5). So the third letter is T, not A. We need the third letter to be A.

  So pattern: letter1, letter2, A, R, letter5.

  Words: ""LIAR?"" -> but that's 4 letters. 5-letter words: ""GUARD"" -> G(1), U(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). This avoids C, N, E. But we haven't tested G, U, D.

  ""HEARD"" -> but H, E: we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E. So avoid.

  ""BOARD"": B(1), O(2), A(3), R(4), D(5) -> avoids C, N, E. Good.

  ""HOARD"": same as above but H.

  ""SOARE"" (a falconry term, not common) and has E -> avoid.

  ""FJORD"": F(1), J(2), O(3) -> wait, third letter is O? We need A at third. So no.

  So ""BOARD"" is a candidate: B, O, A, R, D.

Option 3: R in the fifth position: _ _ A _ R
  Words: ""PIZAR"" (not common), ""TUTAR"" (not a word), ""SONAR"" -> S(1), O(2), N(3) -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So avoid.
  ""LARVA"": L(1), A(2), R(3) -> but we need A at position 3? No: A is at position 2. We need A at position 3.

  Pattern: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, R.

  Words: ""DEBAR"" -> D(1), E(2) -> E is not allowed. Avoid.
  ""JUMAR"" (not common), ""COMA R"" -> but C is not allowed.

  ""VAPOR"": V(1), A(2), P(3) -> no, we need A at position 3.

  It's hard to find common words with R at the end and A at the third.

  ""SUGAR"": S(1), U(2), G(3) -> but we need A at position 3? In ""SUGAR"": S(1), U(2), G(3), A(4), R(5). So the third letter is G, not A. 

  ""LUMAR"" (not common).

  So maybe not many options for R at the end.

Therefore, the two strong candidates are:
1. ""ROAST"" (R at position 1, and then O, S, T)
2. ""BOARD"" (R at position 4, and then B, O, D)

We can also consider putting R in the fourth position and use other letters.

Another candidate: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2) -> no, we need A at position 3. So that's P(1), A(2), R(3) -> but we need A at 3, so that's not.

""GRAPY"" (not a word).

""TRAIN"": T(1), R(2) -> but we cannot put R in the second position because we already tried R in the second position and it was wrong (in ""crane"", R was in second and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not in that position). So we must avoid putting R in the second position.

Therefore, in ""TRAIN"", R is in the second position -> avoid.

So back to ""ROAST"" and ""BOARD"".

Which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""ROAST"": we are testing R (which we know is present) in a new position (position 1), and then O, S, T. We also have A in the correct position (so we expect a check for A).

In ""BOARD"": we are testing B, O, D, and R in position 4 (which we haven't tried), and A in the correct position.

Both are good. But note that in ""ROAST"", we are using S and T which are very common. Also, we are testing R in the first position. If R is actually in the first position, we get a check. If not, then we know R must be in position 4 or 5.

In ""BOARD"", we are testing R in the fourth position.

We might also consider ""ROARS"" but that has duplicate R and S, which might not be as informative.

Another word: ""RASPS"" -> but has S twice and we don't know if S is in the word.

But let's stick to common words.

I think ""ROAST"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we can get a lot of information.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't have R in it? But wait, we know R is in the word, so we should use it to get position information. But we are allowed to not use R? However, if we don't use R, we won't get information about its position. So it's better to use R.

So I'll go with ""ROAST"".

But note: we are not forced to use R? Actually, we know R is in the word, so we should try to find its position. Therefore, we should include R in our next guess.

So, let's guess ""ROAST"".

But wait, what if the word has two R's? We don't know. But that's okay.

So, the next guess: ""ROAST""

We'll get feedback on:
- R in position 1: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, then we know R is in position 4 or 5 (because we know it's not in 2, and we are testing 1 now).
- O in position 2: we don't know about O, so we'll get feedback.
- A in position 3: we know it's correct, so we expect a check.
- S in position 4: new letter.
- T in position 5: new letter.

This should give us good information.

Therefore, I choose ""ROAST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""A"" is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- ""R"" is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- The 3rd letter must be ""A"".
- ""R"" must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1, 4, or 5 are possible).
- Avoid using ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"".
- To maximize information, include new common letters and test ""R"" in a new position.

The word ""roast"" fits these criteria:
- 3rd letter is ""A"".
- ""R"" is in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Avoids ""C"", ""N"", ""E"".
- Introduces new common letters: ""O"", ""S"", ""T"".

This guess will help identify the position of ""R"" and provide feedback on ""O"", ""S"", and ""T"".

<guess>roast</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(-) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""roast""
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 1; so R is present but not in position 1 or 2)
- O: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- S: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- T: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The word has the letter 'A' in position 3 and 'T' in position 5. So the word pattern is: _ _ A _ T

2. The word contains the letters 'R' and 'S', but:
   - 'R' is not in position 1, 2 (and we know it's in the word, so it must be in position 4? But wait, position 5 is T, so R cannot be in position 5. Therefore, the only position left for R is position 4? But we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is A and 5 is T, so R must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But we have feedback that R is not in 1 (from roast) and not in 2 (from crane). Therefore, R must be in position 4.

   However, in guess 2, we put R in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not in position 1. We also know from guess 1 that R is not in position 2. And positions 3 and 5 are taken by A and T, so the only position left is 4. But in guess 2, we put S in position 4 and got a '-' for S, meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. So if R is in position 4, then when we put S in position 4, we would have gotten a different feedback? Actually, no: the feedback for S is independent. But we have:

   - R must be in the word and not in 1 or 2. The available positions are 4 (since 3 and 5 are fixed). So R must be in position 4.

   But wait, in guess 2, we have S in position 4 and we got a '-' for S, meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. That doesn't conflict with R being in position 4 because they are different letters. However, position 4 can only be one letter. So if R is in position 4, then S cannot be in position 4, which is consistent with the feedback. But the feedback for S says S is in the word but not in position 4, so S must be in one of the other positions: 1 or 2 (since 3 and 5 are fixed and taken by A and T).

   Therefore, we have:
   - Position 4 must be R? But we don't have direct evidence. Let's reexamine:

   We know:
   - The word has R (from both guesses) and it's not in position 1 (from roast) and not in position 2 (from crane). The only positions left are 4 (since 3 is A and 5 is T). So R must be in position 4.

   But in guess 2, we put R in position 1 and got a '-' (meaning R is present but not there) and we put S in position 4 and got a '-' (meaning S is present but not there). If R is in position 4, then when we put S in position 4, we would have expected an 'x' for S if S is not in the word, but we got a '-' meaning S is in the word but not in that position. So that is consistent: R is in position 4, and S is in the word but not in position 4 (so S must be in position 1 or 2).

   However, we have a conflict? Because if R is in position 4, then the letter in position 4 is R, so when we put S in position 4, it should be wrong and we should get an 'x' for S if S is not in the word, but we got a '-' meaning S is in the word. So that implies that S is in the word, but not in position 4. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2.

   And R must be in position 4 because that's the only position left.

   So we can conclude:
   - Position 4 is R.

   But wait, we haven't tested position 4 with R. We only know that R is in the word and the only available position is 4. So we can deduce that position 4 must be R.

   Therefore, the word so far is: _ _ A R T

   And we also know that S is in the word and must be in position 1 or 2.

   Additionally, we have:
   - O is not in the word (from roast: O(x))
   - C, N, E are not in the word (from crane)

   So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] A R T

   Where letter1 and letter2 are to be determined, and one of them must be S (because S is in the word and the only positions left are 1 and 2).

   Also, we know that the word does not contain: C, E, N, O.

   Now, we need to find a word that fits: _ _ A R T, with one of the first two letters being S, and the other being a letter not in {C, E, N, O} and not S (if we assume no duplicates? But we don't know about duplicates. However, we have no indication of duplicates so far, so we can assume no duplicates for now).

   But note: we have two positions and we know S is one of them. So the word is either:
   - S _ A R T -> but then the second letter is missing, so it must be a letter that forms a word: S?ART
   - or _ S A R T -> ?SART

   We need to find 5-letter words that end with ""ART"", but note the pattern is _ _ART, and the first two letters: one is S and the other is an unknown.

   Actually, the pattern is: [letter1][letter2]ART

   And one of letter1 or letter2 is S.

   So possibilities:
   - If S is in position 1: then the word is S X A R T, where X is a letter (not C, E, N, O, and not S because we assume no duplicate? But we don't know, so we should consider duplicates? However, we haven't encountered duplicates so far, and we have no feedback suggesting duplicates. So let's first assume no duplicates. Then X cannot be S, and also cannot be A, R, T (because they are already in the word). So X must be a new letter.

   - If S is in position 2: then the word is X S A R T, with X not in {C, E, N, O, A, R, T, S} (if no duplicates).

   Now, let's list possible words:

   Option 1: S in position 1 -> S _ A R T
     Possible words: 
        SMART -> S M A R T -> M is not in the forbidden list? Forbidden: C, E, N, O. M is allowed.
        START -> S T A R T -> but T is already in position 5? And we have T in position 5, but if we put T in position 2, that would be a duplicate T? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback for ""roast"", we had T in position 5 and got a check, meaning the T is in position 5. If the word were ""START"", then it has two T's: one in position 2 and one in position 5. But we haven't tested for duplicates. The feedback for ""roast"" only showed one T (the one in position 5) and it was correct. If there were a T in position 2, we wouldn't know because we didn't have a T in position 2 in any guess. So ""START"" is a possibility? But we have to check the feedback we got.

        However, in ""roast"", we had T in position 5 and it was correct. We didn't have any T in position 2. So if the word is ""START"", then when we guessed ""roast"", we had:
          Position 1: R (which is not in the word in position 1, but in position 4) -> '-'
          Position 2: O (not in the word) -> 'x'
          Position 3: A (correct) -> '✓'
          Position 4: S (which is in the word but not in position 4; in ""START"", S is in position 1, so it should be a '-' for S, which we got)
          Position 5: T (correct) -> '✓'

        So ""START"" is consistent with the feedback? But wait, in ""START"", the letter S is in position 1, but in our guess ""roast"", we put S in position 4. The feedback for S was '-' meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. That matches because in ""START"", S is in position 1.

        However, we also have to consider the first guess ""crane"": 
          ""crane"" for ""START"": 
            C (x) -> correct, not in word
            R (in position 2 of crane, but in ""START"" R is in position 4) -> so R is present but not in position 2 -> '-' which matches
            A (in position 3) -> correct -> '✓' matches
            N (x) -> not in word -> matches
            E (x) -> not in word -> matches

        So ""START"" is a candidate.

        But note: in ""START"", the letter T appears twice? But we don't have feedback about duplicate T. However, the feedback for ""roast"" only showed one T (the one in position 5) and it was correct. The T in position 2 of ""START"" was not tested in any guess, so it's possible.

        But we must also consider: we have feedback that R is in the word and we deduced it must be in position 4. In ""START"", R is in position 4, so that matches.

        However, we also have the letter S: in ""START"", S is in position 1. And we have feedback that S is in the word (from roast) and not in position 4, which is true.

        So ""START"" is a candidate.

        But what about the second letter? In ""START"", the second letter is T. We don't have any feedback about T in position 2. But we know T is in position 5, and if there is another T in position 2, that's a duplicate. The game allows duplicates? The rules don't say the word must have distinct letters, so duplicates are possible.

        Alternatively, we have ""SMART"": S M A R T. 
        In ""SMART"", the letters are S, M, A, R, T. 
        Check against feedback:
          For ""roast"": 
            R in position 1: but in ""SMART"", R is in position 4 -> so R is present but not in 1 -> '-' 
            O: not in word -> 'x'
            A: correct -> '✓'
            S: in position 4 of roast, but in ""SMART"" S is in position 1 -> so S is present but not in 4 -> '-' 
            T: in position 5 -> '✓'
          So that matches.

        Also, for ""crane"": same as above, it matches.

        So both ""START"" and ""SMART"" are candidates.

   Option 2: S in position 2 -> _ S A R T
     Possible words: 
        We need a letter for the first position. The word would be X S A R T.
        Common words: not many. 
        ""USART"" is not a word.
        ""ISART"" not a word.
        ""ESART"" not a word.
        ""ASTART"" is 6 letters.
        Actually, I can't think of a common English word that ends with ""SART"". 

        Let me check: 
          We have words like ""ASSART"" but that has two S's and is 6 letters? 
          Or ""DISART"" not a word.

        So probably no common word with the pattern _ S A R T.

        Therefore, the only possibilities are with S in position 1: so words starting with S and ending with ART, but with 5 letters: so S?ART, where ? is a letter.

        We have:
          SMART (M)
          START (T) -> but duplicate T?
          SWART (meaning dark, but less common) -> W
          SPART (a type of fiber, not common) -> P
          SCART (a connector, but we know C is not in the word) -> invalid because C is not allowed.

        So the common ones are ""SMART"" and ""START"".

        We also have ""SHART"", but that's informal and might not be in the word list.

        So we have two main candidates: ""SMART"" and ""START"".

        How to distinguish? We need to make a guess that can test the second position.

        We know that in ""START"", the second letter is T, and in ""SMART"", the second letter is M.

        We also know that we haven't tested M or T in the second position.

        We can make a guess that includes one of these and tests the positions.

        But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try to guess one of these.

        Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses both possibilities? But we have to choose one word.

        However, we can also consider that we have to fill the first two positions. We know S must be in one of them, and we think it's position 1. So we can guess ""SMART"" and if it's not that, then ""START""?

        But we have to make one guess.

        Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests the second position without committing to one of these.

        But we have the pattern: _ _ A R T, and we know S is in the first or second. We already think it's first, so let's assume that and then test the second position.

        We can guess a word that has:
          Position 1: S (because we think it's S)
          Position 2: a letter that we haven't used and is common, but we don't have many letters left to test? 

        But we are going to guess the whole word.

        Since we have two strong candidates, we can choose one. Let's choose the more common word.

        ""START"" is a very common word, and ""SMART"" is also common.

        But note: in ""START"", we have a duplicate T? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. The rules don't prohibit duplicates, so it's possible.

        However, we can look at the feedback: in the first guess, we had T? No, we didn't have T in ""crane"". In the second guess, we had T in position 5 and it was correct. But we didn't have T in any other position.

        So we don't have information about a second T.

        How can we get more information without guessing one of the candidates? We could guess a word that has different letters in the first two positions to test.

        For example, we can guess a word that has the pattern: S _ A R T, but with a letter in the second position that is not M or T? But then it wouldn't be a real word? We have to guess a valid word.

        Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the same pattern but with a different set of letters to test for the presence of M or T in the second position.

        But we know the second position must be filled by a letter that is not in the forbidden list and not A, R, T (if we assume no duplicate) or if duplicates are allowed, then it could be T.

        We can try to guess ""SMART"" and see.

        But we are allowed to guess the word. If we guess ""SMART"" and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that tells us.

        Similarly for ""START"".

        However, we have to consider that there might be other words. For example, ""SWART"" (which means dark or swarthy) is a word, but less common.

        Given that, I think the two most common are ""START"" and ""SMART"". 

        We can also consider ""SPART"", but that's not common and we don't know if it's in the word list.

        So let's choose between ""START"" and ""SMART"".

        How about we consider the feedback we have: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was present but not there. In the second guess, we had R in position 1 and it was present but not there. We deduced R is in position 4.

        Now, if we guess ""SMART"", we are putting M in position 2. We haven't tested M before. If the word is ""START"", then we will get feedback that M is not in the word (x) and S is in position 1 (so we get a check for S? But wait, in ""START"", S is in position 1, so if we guess ""SMART"", then:

          Position 1: S -> in ""START"", S is in position 1 -> ✓
          Position 2: M -> not in ""START"" -> x
          Position 3: A -> ✓
          Position 4: R -> in ""START"", R is in position 4 -> ✓
          Position 5: T -> ✓

        So we would get: S(✓) M(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) -> so we know the word is S _ A R T, and the second letter is not M. Then we can guess ""START"" next.

        Similarly, if we guess ""START"", and the word is ""SMART"", then:

          Position 1: S -> ✓
          Position 2: T -> in ""SMART"", the second letter is M, so T is not in the word? But wait, in ""SMART"", there is a T at the end, but we are putting T in position 2. So for ""START"" guessed against ""SMART"":
            S: position 1: in ""SMART"" is S? -> ✓
            T: position 2: in ""SMART"" there is no T in position 2, and there is a T in position 5. But we have to check: is T present elsewhere? The feedback for T would be: since T is in the word but not in position 2, we would get a '-' for T? But wait, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but not in that position, we get '-'. But in ""SMART"", there is one T at the end. So when we put T in position 2, it is not in the word in that position, but it is in the word in position 5. So we should get a '-' for T in position 2.

          So:
            S(✓) T(-) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) -> but wait, we have two T's in the guess? The feedback for the second T: we have T in position 5 and it is correct (because ""SMART"" has T in position 5) -> ✓. But the T in position 2: since there is a T in the word (at position 5) but not in position 2, we get '-'.

          So the feedback would be: S(✓), T(-), A(✓), R(✓), T(✓)

          This would tell us that T is in the word but not in position 2, and we know T is in position 5 (from the last T). Then we would know the second letter is not T, so we can guess ""SMART"" next.

        Therefore, in either case, we can guess one of them and then the next guess will be the other.

        But we are on the third guess, and we have 4 more guesses, so it's safe.

        However, we might get it right on the third guess.

        Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that doesn't commit to either but tests the second position.

        For example, we can guess a word that has the pattern: _ _ A R T, but with the first two letters being letters we haven't tried, but that is difficult because we don't know many words.

        Or we can guess a word that has M in the second position and T in the first? But that might not be the pattern.

        Another idea: guess a word that has M and T in it, but not necessarily in the first two positions? But we are constrained by the known positions.

        We know the pattern: _ _ A R T, so we must have A in 3, R in 4, T in 5.

        So we can only vary the first two.

        We can guess ""SMART"" to test M in the second position.

        Since ""SMART"" is a common word, I'll go with that.

        But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, E, N, O.

        ""SMART"" uses S, M, A, R, T -> all allowed.

        So let's guess ""SMART"".

        If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that tells us the second letter is not M, so it must be T (in ""START"") or something else (like W in ""SWART"", but less common).

        But we'll handle that in the next guess.

        Alternatively, we can guess ""START"" first. But I think ""SMART"" is a good choice.

        However, let me check the frequency: ""START"" is more common? But both are common.

        I'll go with ""SMART"".

        But wait, we have feedback that S is in the word and we think it's in position 1. In ""SMART"", we put S in position 1, so if it's correct, we get a check.

        So:

        Guess: ""SMART""

        If the word is ""SMART"", we get all correct.

        If the word is ""START"", we get: 
          S(✓) M(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓)

        Then we know the second letter is not M, so we can guess ""START"" next.

        If the word is ""SWART"", we get: 
          S(✓) W(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) -> then we know it's not M, and we can try other letters for the second position.

        But ""SWART"" is less common, so we might try ""START"" next and then if that fails, try ""SWART"".

        Given the above, I think ""SMART"" is a good guess.

        But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have room.

        Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that tests multiple possibilities for the second letter? But we have to stick to the pattern.

        Another candidate: ""SHART"" (but informal) or ""SPART"" (not common). So we'll stick with ""SMART"".

        Therefore, I choose ""SMART"".

        But wait, what if the word is not in the pattern we deduced? We are confident that position 4 is R? Let me double-check.

        We know:
          - R is in the word (from both guesses).
          - R is not in position 1 (from roast: R in position 1 got '-')
          - R is not in position 2 (from crane: R in position 2 got '-')
          - The only positions left are 4 (since 3 is A and 5 is T, and 1 and 2 are open but we just ruled them out for R). So R must be in position 4.

        Therefore, the pattern is fixed: _ _ A R T.

        And S must be in position 1 or 2. And we have no other candidates for position 1 or 2 that are common besides S and then M or T.

        So I think we are safe.

        Let's go with ""SMART"".

        But note: in the feedback for ""roast"", we had S in position 4 and got a '-', meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. That doesn't tell us where S is, but we deduced it must be in 1 or 2. And we are putting S in position 1 in ""SMART"", which is a candidate.

        So, the next guess is ""SMART"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - C (x) not in word  
  - R (-) in word but wrong position (not position 2)  
  - A (✓) correct position (position 3)  
  - N (x) not in word  
  - E (x) not in word  

- **Guess 2 (roast)**:  
  - R (-) in word but wrong position (not position 1 or 2)  
  - O (x) not in word  
  - A (✓) correct position (position 3)  
  - S (-) in word but wrong position (not position 4)  
  - T (✓) correct position (position 5)  

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 3 is **A** (from both guesses).  
   - Position 5 is **T** (from ""roast"").  
   
2. **Present letters (wrong positions)**:  
   - **R** is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 4 is now reserved for R based on deduction below).  
     - *Why position 4?* R must be in the word, and the only remaining position is 4 (positions 3 and 5 are fixed, and positions 1/2 are ruled out by feedback).  
   - **S** is in the word but not in position 4. Since positions 3 and 5 are fixed, S must be in position 1 or 2.  

3. **Absent letters**: C, E, N, O (cannot appear in the word).  

4. **Word pattern**:  
   - The word must match `_ _ A R T` (positions: 3=A, 4=R, 5=T).  
   - One of the first two positions (1 or 2) must be **S**.  

### Analysis for next guess:
- The pattern `_ _ A R T` with **S** in position 1 or 2 leaves two likely candidates:  
  - **SMART**: S in position 1, M in position 2.  
  - **START**: S in position 1, T in position 2 (duplicate T, allowed in Wordle).  
- Testing **SMART** is strategic:  
  - If correct, the game ends.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on position 2 (M) will confirm if it’s absent (x), narrowing the solution to **START** or less common words like **SWART**.  

**Next guess**: ""SMART"" (tests S in position 1 and M in position 2, while respecting all constraints).

So possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters. For example, we might try to include S, T, L, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- If we put R in the first position: R _ A _ _\n  - Examples: ""RADAR"" (but has R in first and last, and A in third and fifth? But we know A is only in third? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. The secret word might have two A\'s? But in our feedback, we only have one A and it was correct. However, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicate letters unless we guess them. So we must be cautious. But in this case, we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven\'t ruled out duplicates. But for now, let\'s avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one A and it was correct. If the word had two A\'s, but we only guessed one, then we wouldn\'t know about the other. Similarly, for R, we only know there\'s at least one R.\n\nSo, let\'s try to form a word that has R in a new position and uses new letters.\n\nIdea: put R in the first position and use common letters for the rest.\n\nWord: ""RATIO"" -> but that has T and I and O, which are new. However, the pattern would be R A T I O? But wait, we need the third letter to be A. In ""RATIO"", the third letter is T, not A. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A. So the pattern is: _ _ A _ _\n\nWith R in the first position: R _ A _ _\n\nPossible words: \n- ""ROAST"": R O A S T -> but O, S, T are new. However, we have to avoid E, C, N. This seems okay. But note: the second letter is O, which we haven\'t tried. Also, we have S and T.\n\nBut wait, in ""ROAST"", the third letter is A? Yes: positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T.\n\nBut we also have the constraint that R is not in the second position? Actually, in this word, R is in the first, which is fine. And we are including R, which we know is in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we could put R in the fourth position: _ _ A R _\nOr fifth: _ _ A _ R\n\nBut let\'s think about what we can test. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother common starting approach is to try a word that uses the known correct letter and the known present letter, and then three new letters.\n\nSo, let\'s try to form a word with:\n- Position 3: A\n- R in either 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2, because we already tried R in position 2 and it was wrong).\n\nWe also want to avoid C, N, E.\n\nLet me list some words that fit the pattern and include R and avoid C, N, E.\n\nOption 1: R in position 1 -> R _ A _ _\n  Words: ""ROAST"", ""RABAT"" (not common), ""RADAR"" (has two R\'s and two A\'s, but we don\'t know about duplicates), ""RAPID"", ""RASPY"", ""RAYON"" (has N, which is bad because we know N is not in the word). So we avoid words with N.\n\n  ""ROAST"": R O A S T -> no C, N, E. Good.\n  ""RAPID"": R A P I D -> but wait, the third letter is P? No: R (1), A (2), P (3) -> so that doesn\'t have A in the third. We need the third letter to be A.\n\n  Actually, for ""RAPID"": \n    Position 1: R\n    Position 2: A\n    Position 3: P -> so that\'s not A in the third. We need the third letter to be A.\n\n  So we must have the pattern: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.\n\n  Therefore, for R in first: R (letter1), then any letter for letter2 (but not R because we don\'t want to repeat unless necessary? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed), then A (third), then two more.\n\n  So ""ROAST"": R (1), O (2), A (3), S (4), T (5) -> valid.\n\n  Similarly, ""RALLY"": R (1), A (2) -> wait, no: R (1), A (2), L (3) -> but we need A at position 3. So that\'s not.\n\n  Another: ""REAST"" (archaic, not common) -> avoid.\n\n  ""ROARS"": R (1), O (2), A (3), R (4), S (5) -> but has two R\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. Also, we are avoiding E, C, N? It doesn\'t have those. But it\'s a valid word.\n\n  However, we want to use distinct letters to maximize information? But if we use duplicate R, we might not get full information. But we know R is in the word, so if we put R in two positions, we might get feedback on both.\n\n  But since we are limited by the known constraints, let\'s try to avoid duplicates for now to cover more letters.\n\n  So ""ROAST"" is a good candidate: uses O, S, T which are common.\n\nOption 2: R in the fourth position: _ _ A R _\n  Words: ""STARL"" (not a word), ""SCARF"" (has C? C is not allowed because we know C is not in the word). We must avoid C.\n  ""ALTAR"": A (1), L (2), T (3) -> wait, we need A at position 3? No: in ""ALTAR"": A(1), L(2), T(3), A(4), R(5). So the third letter is T, not A. We need the third letter to be A.\n\n  So pattern: letter1, letter2, A, R, letter5.\n\n  Words: ""LIAR?"" -> but that\'s 4 letters. 5-letter words: ""GUARD"" -> G(1), U(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). This avoids C, N, E. But we haven\'t tested G, U, D.\n\n  ""HEARD"" -> but H, E: we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E. So avoid.\n\n  ""BOARD"": B(1), O(2), A(3), R(4), D(5) -> avoids C, N, E. Good.\n\n  ""HOARD"": same as above but H.\n\n  ""SOARE"" (a falconry term, not common) and has E -> avoid.\n\n  ""FJORD"": F(1), J(2), O(3) -> wait, third letter is O? We need A at third. So no.\n\n  So ""BOARD"" is a candidate: B, O, A, R, D.\n\nOption 3: R in the fifth position: _ _ A _ R\n  Words: ""PIZAR"" (not common), ""TUTAR"" (not a word), ""SONAR"" -> S(1), O(2), N(3) -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So avoid.\n  ""LARVA"": L(1), A(2), R(3) -> but we need A at position 3? No: A is at position 2. We need A at position 3.\n\n  Pattern: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, R.\n\n  Words: ""DEBAR"" -> D(1), E(2) -> E is not allowed. Avoid.\n  ""JUMAR"" (not common), ""COMA R"" -> but C is not allowed.\n\n  ""VAPOR"": V(1), A(2), P(3) -> no, we need A at position 3.\n\n  It\'s hard to find common words with R at the end and A at the third.\n\n  ""SUGAR"": S(1), U(2), G(3) -> but we need A at position 3? In ""SUGAR"": S(1), U(2), G(3), A(4), R(5). So the third letter is G, not A. \n\n  ""LUMAR"" (not common).\n\n  So maybe not many options for R at the end.\n\nTherefore, the two strong candidates are:\n1. ""ROAST"" (R at position 1, and then O, S, T)\n2. ""BOARD"" (R at position 4, and then B, O, D)\n\nWe can also consider putting R in the fourth position and use other letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2) -> no, we need A at position 3. So that\'s P(1), A(2), R(3) -> but we need A at 3, so that\'s not.\n\n""GRAPY"" (not a word).\n\n""TRAIN"": T(1), R(2) -> but we cannot put R in the second position because we already tried R in the second position and it was wrong (in ""crane"", R was in second and got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not in that position). So we must avoid putting R in the second position.\n\nTherefore, in ""TRAIN"", R is in the second position -> avoid.\n\nSo back to ""ROAST"" and ""BOARD"".\n\nWhich one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nIn ""ROAST"": we are testing R (which we know is present) in a new position (position 1), and then O, S, T. We also have A in the correct position (so we expect a check for A).\n\nIn ""BOARD"": we are testing B, O, D, and R in position 4 (which we haven\'t tried), and A in the correct position.\n\nBoth are good. But note that in ""ROAST"", we are using S and T which are very common. Also, we are testing R in the first position. If R is actually in the first position, we get a check. If not, then we know R must be in position 4 or 5.\n\nIn ""BOARD"", we are testing R in the fourth position.\n\nWe might also consider ""ROARS"" but that has duplicate R and S, which might not be as informative.\n\nAnother word: ""RASPS"" -> but has S twice and we don\'t know if S is in the word.\n\nBut let\'s stick to common words.\n\nI think ""ROAST"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we can get a lot of information.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t have R in it? But wait, we know R is in the word, so we should use it to get position information. But we are allowed to not use R? However, if we don\'t use R, we won\'t get information about its position. So it\'s better to use R.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ROAST"".\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use R? Actually, we know R is in the word, so we should try to find its position. Therefore, we should include R in our next guess.\n\nSo, let\'s guess ""ROAST"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word has two R\'s? We don\'t know. But that\'s okay.\n\nSo, the next guess: ""ROAST""\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on:\n- R in position 1: if it\'s correct, we get a check; if not, then we know R is in position 4 or 5 (because we know it\'s not in 2, and we are testing 1 now).\n- O in position 2: we don\'t know about O, so we\'ll get feedback.\n- A in position 3: we know it\'s correct, so we expect a check.\n- S in position 4: new letter.\n- T in position 5: new letter.\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""ROAST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- ""A"" is in the correct position (3rd letter).\n- ""R"" is in the word but not in the 2nd position.\n- ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The 3rd letter must be ""A"".\n- ""R"" must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1, 4, or 5 are possible).\n- Avoid using ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"".\n- To maximize information, include new common letters and test ""R"" in a new position.\n\nThe word ""roast"" fits these criteria:\n- 3rd letter is ""A"".\n- ""R"" is in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- Avoids ""C"", ""N"", ""E"".\n- Introduces new common letters: ""O"", ""S"", ""T"".\n\nThis guess will help identify the position of ""R"" and provide feedback on ""O"", ""S"", and ""T"".\n\n<guess>roast</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(-) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- A: ✓ (correct, in position 3)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""roast""\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 1; so R is present but not in position 1 or 2)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct, in position 3)\n- S: - (in the word, but not in position 4)\n- T: ✓ (correct, in position 5)\n\nSo, from the feedback, we know:\n\n1. The word has the letter \'A\' in position 3 and \'T\' in position 5. So the word pattern is: _ _ A _ T\n\n2. The word contains the letters \'R\' and \'S\', but:\n   - \'R\' is not in position 1, 2 (and we know it\'s in the word, so it must be in position 4? But wait, position 5 is T, so R cannot be in position 5. Therefore, the only position left for R is position 4? But we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is A and 5 is T, so R must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But we have feedback that R is not in 1 (from roast) and not in 2 (from crane). Therefore, R must be in position 4.\n\n   However, in guess 2, we put R in position 1 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not in position 1. We also know from guess 1 that R is not in position 2. And positions 3 and 5 are taken by A and T, so the only position left is 4. But in guess 2, we put S in position 4 and got a \'-\' for S, meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. So if R is in position 4, then when we put S in position 4, we would have gotten a different feedback? Actually, no: the feedback for S is independent. But we have:\n\n   - R must be in the word and not in 1 or 2. The available positions are 4 (since 3 and 5 are fixed). So R must be in position 4.\n\n   But wait, in guess 2, we have S in position 4 and we got a \'-\' for S, meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. That doesn\'t conflict with R being in position 4 because they are different letters. However, position 4 can only be one letter. So if R is in position 4, then S cannot be in position 4, which is consistent with the feedback. But the feedback for S says S is in the word but not in position 4, so S must be in one of the other positions: 1 or 2 (since 3 and 5 are fixed and taken by A and T).\n\n   Therefore, we have:\n   - Position 4 must be R? But we don\'t have direct evidence. Let\'s reexamine:\n\n   We know:\n   - The word has R (from both guesses) and it\'s not in position 1 (from roast) and not in position 2 (from crane). The only positions left are 4 (since 3 is A and 5 is T). So R must be in position 4.\n\n   But in guess 2, we put R in position 1 and got a \'-\' (meaning R is present but not there) and we put S in position 4 and got a \'-\' (meaning S is present but not there). If R is in position 4, then when we put S in position 4, we would have expected an \'x\' for S if S is not in the word, but we got a \'-\' meaning S is in the word but not in that position. So that is consistent: R is in position 4, and S is in the word but not in position 4 (so S must be in position 1 or 2).\n\n   However, we have a conflict? Because if R is in position 4, then the letter in position 4 is R, so when we put S in position 4, it should be wrong and we should get an \'x\' for S if S is not in the word, but we got a \'-\' meaning S is in the word. So that implies that S is in the word, but not in position 4. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2.\n\n   And R must be in position 4 because that\'s the only position left.\n\n   So we can conclude:\n   - Position 4 is R.\n\n   But wait, we haven\'t tested position 4 with R. We only know that R is in the word and the only available position is 4. So we can deduce that position 4 must be R.\n\n   Therefore, the word so far is: _ _ A R T\n\n   And we also know that S is in the word and must be in position 1 or 2.\n\n   Additionally, we have:\n   - O is not in the word (from roast: O(x))\n   - C, N, E are not in the word (from crane)\n\n   So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] A R T\n\n   Where letter1 and letter2 are to be determined, and one of them must be S (because S is in the word and the only positions left are 1 and 2).\n\n   Also, we know that the word does not contain: C, E, N, O.\n\n   Now, we need to find a word that fits: _ _ A R T, with one of the first two letters being S, and the other being a letter not in {C, E, N, O} and not S (if we assume no duplicates? But we don\'t know about duplicates. However, we have no indication of duplicates so far, so we can assume no duplicates for now).\n\n   But note: we have two positions and we know S is one of them. So the word is either:\n   - S _ A R T -> but then the second letter is missing, so it must be a letter that forms a word: S?ART\n   - or _ S A R T -> ?SART\n\n   We need to find 5-letter words that end with ""ART"", but note the pattern is _ _ART, and the first two letters: one is S and the other is an unknown.\n\n   Actually, the pattern is: [letter1][letter2]ART\n\n   And one of letter1 or letter2 is S.\n\n   So possibilities:\n   - If S is in position 1: then the word is S X A R T, where X is a letter (not C, E, N, O, and not S because we assume no duplicate? But we don\'t know, so we should consider duplicates? However, we haven\'t encountered duplicates so far, and we have no feedback suggesting duplicates. So let\'s first assume no duplicates. Then X cannot be S, and also cannot be A, R, T (because they are already in the word). So X must be a new letter.\n\n   - If S is in position 2: then the word is X S A R T, with X not in {C, E, N, O, A, R, T, S} (if no duplicates).\n\n   Now, let\'s list possible words:\n\n   Option 1: S in position 1 -> S _ A R T\n     Possible words: \n        SMART -> S M A R T -> M is not in the forbidden list? Forbidden: C, E, N, O. M is allowed.\n        START -> S T A R T -> but T is already in position 5? And we have T in position 5, but if we put T in position 2, that would be a duplicate T? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback for ""roast"", we had T in position 5 and got a check, meaning the T is in position 5. If the word were ""START"", then it has two T\'s: one in position 2 and one in position 5. But we haven\'t tested for duplicates. The feedback for ""roast"" only showed one T (the one in position 5) and it was correct. If there were a T in position 2, we wouldn\'t know because we didn\'t have a T in position 2 in any guess. So ""START"" is a possibility? But we have to check the feedback we got.\n\n        However, in ""roast"", we had T in position 5 and it was correct. We didn\'t have any T in position 2. So if the word is ""START"", then when we guessed ""roast"", we had:\n          Position 1: R (which is not in the word in position 1, but in position 4) -> \'-\'\n          Position 2: O (not in the word) -> \'x\'\n          Position 3: A (correct) -> \'✓\'\n          Position 4: S (which is in the word but not in position 4; in ""START"", S is in position 1, so it should be a \'-\' for S, which we got)\n          Position 5: T (correct) -> \'✓\'\n\n        So ""START"" is consistent with the feedback? But wait, in ""START"", the letter S is in position 1, but in our guess ""roast"", we put S in position 4. The feedback for S was \'-\' meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. That matches because in ""START"", S is in position 1.\n\n        However, we also have to consider the first guess ""crane"": \n          ""crane"" for ""START"": \n            C (x) -> correct, not in word\n            R (in position 2 of crane, but in ""START"" R is in position 4) -> so R is present but not in position 2 -> \'-\' which matches\n            A (in position 3) -> correct -> \'✓\' matches\n            N (x) -> not in word -> matches\n            E (x) -> not in word -> matches\n\n        So ""START"" is a candidate.\n\n        But note: in ""START"", the letter T appears twice? But we don\'t have feedback about duplicate T. However, the feedback for ""roast"" only showed one T (the one in position 5) and it was correct. The T in position 2 of ""START"" was not tested in any guess, so it\'s possible.\n\n        But we must also consider: we have feedback that R is in the word and we deduced it must be in position 4. In ""START"", R is in position 4, so that matches.\n\n        However, we also have the letter S: in ""START"", S is in position 1. And we have feedback that S is in the word (from roast) and not in position 4, which is true.\n\n        So ""START"" is a candidate.\n\n        But what about the second letter? In ""START"", the second letter is T. We don\'t have any feedback about T in position 2. But we know T is in position 5, and if there is another T in position 2, that\'s a duplicate. The game allows duplicates? The rules don\'t say the word must have distinct letters, so duplicates are possible.\n\n        Alternatively, we have ""SMART"": S M A R T. \n        In ""SMART"", the letters are S, M, A, R, T. \n        Check against feedback:\n          For ""roast"": \n            R in position 1: but in ""SMART"", R is in position 4 -> so R is present but not in 1 -> \'-\' \n            O: not in word -> \'x\'\n            A: correct -> \'✓\'\n            S: in position 4 of roast, but in ""SMART"" S is in position 1 -> so S is present but not in 4 -> \'-\' \n            T: in position 5 -> \'✓\'\n          So that matches.\n\n        Also, for ""crane"": same as above, it matches.\n\n        So both ""START"" and ""SMART"" are candidates.\n\n   Option 2: S in position 2 -> _ S A R T\n     Possible words: \n        We need a letter for the first position. The word would be X S A R T.\n        Common words: not many. \n        ""USART"" is not a word.\n        ""ISART"" not a word.\n        ""ESART"" not a word.\n        ""ASTART"" is 6 letters.\n        Actually, I can\'t think of a common English word that ends with ""SART"". \n\n        Let me check: \n          We have words like ""ASSART"" but that has two S\'s and is 6 letters? \n          Or ""DISART"" not a word.\n\n        So probably no common word with the pattern _ S A R T.\n\n        Therefore, the only possibilities are with S in position 1: so words starting with S and ending with ART, but with 5 letters: so S?ART, where ? is a letter.\n\n        We have:\n          SMART (M)\n          START (T) -> but duplicate T?\n          SWART (meaning dark, but less common) -> W\n          SPART (a type of fiber, not common) -> P\n          SCART (a connector, but we know C is not in the word) -> invalid because C is not allowed.\n\n        So the common ones are ""SMART"" and ""START"".\n\n        We also have ""SHART"", but that\'s informal and might not be in the word list.\n\n        So we have two main candidates: ""SMART"" and ""START"".\n\n        How to distinguish? We need to make a guess that can test the second position.\n\n        We know that in ""START"", the second letter is T, and in ""SMART"", the second letter is M.\n\n        We also know that we haven\'t tested M or T in the second position.\n\n        We can make a guess that includes one of these and tests the positions.\n\n        But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try to guess one of these.\n\n        Alternatively, we can make a guess that uses both possibilities? But we have to choose one word.\n\n        However, we can also consider that we have to fill the first two positions. We know S must be in one of them, and we think it\'s position 1. So we can guess ""SMART"" and if it\'s not that, then ""START""?\n\n        But we have to make one guess.\n\n        Alternatively, we can make a guess that tests the second position without committing to one of these.\n\n        But we have the pattern: _ _ A R T, and we know S is in the first or second. We already think it\'s first, so let\'s assume that and then test the second position.\n\n        We can guess a word that has:\n          Position 1: S (because we think it\'s S)\n          Position 2: a letter that we haven\'t used and is common, but we don\'t have many letters left to test? \n\n        But we are going to guess the whole word.\n\n        Since we have two strong candidates, we can choose one. Let\'s choose the more common word.\n\n        ""START"" is a very common word, and ""SMART"" is also common.\n\n        But note: in ""START"", we have a duplicate T? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. The rules don\'t prohibit duplicates, so it\'s possible.\n\n        However, we can look at the feedback: in the first guess, we had T? No, we didn\'t have T in ""crane"". In the second guess, we had T in position 5 and it was correct. But we didn\'t have T in any other position.\n\n        So we don\'t have information about a second T.\n\n        How can we get more information without guessing one of the candidates? We could guess a word that has different letters in the first two positions to test.\n\n        For example, we can guess a word that has the pattern: S _ A R T, but with a letter in the second position that is not M or T? But then it wouldn\'t be a real word? We have to guess a valid word.\n\n        Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the same pattern but with a different set of letters to test for the presence of M or T in the second position.\n\n        But we know the second position must be filled by a letter that is not in the forbidden list and not A, R, T (if we assume no duplicate) or if duplicates are allowed, then it could be T.\n\n        We can try to guess ""SMART"" and see.\n\n        But we are allowed to guess the word. If we guess ""SMART"" and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that tells us.\n\n        Similarly for ""START"".\n\n        However, we have to consider that there might be other words. For example, ""SWART"" (which means dark or swarthy) is a word, but less common.\n\n        Given that, I think the two most common are ""START"" and ""SMART"". \n\n        We can also consider ""SPART"", but that\'s not common and we don\'t know if it\'s in the word list.\n\n        So let\'s choose between ""START"" and ""SMART"".\n\n        How about we consider the feedback we have: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was present but not there. In the second guess, we had R in position 1 and it was present but not there. We deduced R is in position 4.\n\n        Now, if we guess ""SMART"", we are putting M in position 2. We haven\'t tested M before. If the word is ""START"", then we will get feedback that M is not in the word (x) and S is in position 1 (so we get a check for S? But wait, in ""START"", S is in position 1, so if we guess ""SMART"", then:\n\n          Position 1: S -> in ""START"", S is in position 1 -> ✓\n          Position 2: M -> not in ""START"" -> x\n          Position 3: A -> ✓\n          Position 4: R -> in ""START"", R is in position 4 -> ✓\n          Position 5: T -> ✓\n\n        So we would get: S(✓) M(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) -> so we know the word is S _ A R T, and the second letter is not M. Then we can guess ""START"" next.\n\n        Similarly, if we guess ""START"", and the word is ""SMART"", then:\n\n          Position 1: S -> ✓\n          Position 2: T -> in ""SMART"", the second letter is M, so T is not in the word? But wait, in ""SMART"", there is a T at the end, but we are putting T in position 2. So for ""START"" guessed against ""SMART"":\n            S: position 1: in ""SMART"" is S? -> ✓\n            T: position 2: in ""SMART"" there is no T in position 2, and there is a T in position 5. But we have to check: is T present elsewhere? The feedback for T would be: since T is in the word but not in position 2, we would get a \'-\' for T? But wait, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but not in that position, we get \'-\'. But in ""SMART"", there is one T at the end. So when we put T in position 2, it is not in the word in that position, but it is in the word in position 5. So we should get a \'-\' for T in position 2.\n\n          So:\n            S(✓) T(-) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) -> but wait, we have two T\'s in the guess? The feedback for the second T: we have T in position 5 and it is correct (because ""SMART"" has T in position 5) -> ✓. But the T in position 2: since there is a T in the word (at position 5) but not in position 2, we get \'-\'.\n\n          So the feedback would be: S(✓), T(-), A(✓), R(✓), T(✓)\n\n          This would tell us that T is in the word but not in position 2, and we know T is in position 5 (from the last T). Then we would know the second letter is not T, so we can guess ""SMART"" next.\n\n        Therefore, in either case, we can guess one of them and then the next guess will be the other.\n\n        But we are on the third guess, and we have 4 more guesses, so it\'s safe.\n\n        However, we might get it right on the third guess.\n\n        Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that doesn\'t commit to either but tests the second position.\n\n        For example, we can guess a word that has the pattern: _ _ A R T, but with the first two letters being letters we haven\'t tried, but that is difficult because we don\'t know many words.\n\n        Or we can guess a word that has M in the second position and T in the first? But that might not be the pattern.\n\n        Another idea: guess a word that has M and T in it, but not necessarily in the first two positions? But we are constrained by the known positions.\n\n        We know the pattern: _ _ A R T, so we must have A in 3, R in 4, T in 5.\n\n        So we can only vary the first two.\n\n        We can guess ""SMART"" to test M in the second position.\n\n        Since ""SMART"" is a common word, I\'ll go with that.\n\n        But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, E, N, O.\n\n        ""SMART"" uses S, M, A, R, T -> all allowed.\n\n        So let\'s guess ""SMART"".\n\n        If it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that tells us the second letter is not M, so it must be T (in ""START"") or something else (like W in ""SWART"", but less common).\n\n        But we\'ll handle that in the next guess.\n\n        Alternatively, we can guess ""START"" first. But I think ""SMART"" is a good choice.\n\n        However, let me check the frequency: ""START"" is more common? But both are common.\n\n        I\'ll go with ""SMART"".\n\n        But wait, we have feedback that S is in the word and we think it\'s in position 1. In ""SMART"", we put S in position 1, so if it\'s correct, we get a check.\n\n        So:\n\n        Guess: ""SMART""\n\n        If the word is ""SMART"", we get all correct.\n\n        If the word is ""START"", we get: \n          S(✓) M(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓)\n\n        Then we know the second letter is not M, so we can guess ""START"" next.\n\n        If the word is ""SWART"", we get: \n          S(✓) W(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) -> then we know it\'s not M, and we can try other letters for the second position.\n\n        But ""SWART"" is less common, so we might try ""START"" next and then if that fails, try ""SWART"".\n\n        Given the above, I think ""SMART"" is a good guess.\n\n        But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have room.\n\n        Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that tests multiple possibilities for the second letter? But we have to stick to the pattern.\n\n        Another candidate: ""SHART"" (but informal) or ""SPART"" (not common). So we\'ll stick with ""SMART"".\n\n        Therefore, I choose ""SMART"".\n\n        But wait, what if the word is not in the pattern we deduced? We are confident that position 4 is R? Let me double-check.\n\n        We know:\n          - R is in the word (from both guesses).\n          - R is not in position 1 (from roast: R in position 1 got \'-\')\n          - R is not in position 2 (from crane: R in position 2 got \'-\')\n          - The only positions left are 4 (since 3 is A and 5 is T, and 1 and 2 are open but we just ruled them out for R). So R must be in position 4.\n\n        Therefore, the pattern is fixed: _ _ A R T.\n\n        And S must be in position 1 or 2. And we have no other candidates for position 1 or 2 that are common besides S and then M or T.\n\n        So I think we are safe.\n\n        Let\'s go with ""SMART"".\n\n        But note: in the feedback for ""roast"", we had S in position 4 and got a \'-\', meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. That doesn\'t tell us where S is, but we deduced it must be in 1 or 2. And we are putting S in position 1 in ""SMART"", which is a candidate.\n\n        So, the next guess is ""SMART"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  \n  - C (x) not in word  \n  - R (-) in word but wrong position (not position 2)  \n  - A (✓) correct position (position 3)  \n  - N (x) not in word  \n  - E (x) not in word  \n\n- **Guess 2 (roast)**:  \n  - R (-) in word but wrong position (not position 1 or 2)  \n  - O (x) not in word  \n  - A (✓) correct position (position 3)  \n  - S (-) in word but wrong position (not position 4)  \n  - T (✓) correct position (position 5)  \n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Fixed positions**:  \n   - Position 3 is **A** (from both guesses).  \n   - Position 5 is **T** (from ""roast"").  \n   \n2. **Present letters (wrong positions)**:  \n   - **R** is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 4 is now reserved for R based on deduction below).  \n     - *Why position 4?* R must be in the word, and the only remaining position is 4 (positions 3 and 5 are fixed, and positions 1/2 are ruled out by feedback).  \n   - **S** is in the word but not in position 4.

We have feedback from the third guess ""smart"":
- S: ✓ (correct position, so position 1 is S)
- M: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (position 3 is A)
- R: ✓ (position 4 is R)
- T: ✓ (position 5 is T)

Given the feedback, we know:
- The first letter is S (from the check on S).
- The third letter is A.
- The fourth letter is R.
- The fifth letter is T.
- M is not in the word.

We also know from previous feedback:
- The word pattern is: S _ A R T (so the second letter is missing).
- We have ruled out letters: C, E, N, O, M.

The unknown is the second letter. We need a 5-letter English word of the form S _ A R T.

From previous, we had two candidates: ""SMART"" (which was incorrect because M is not in the word) and ""START"" (with T in the second position).

Given that M is not in the word, ""SMART"" is eliminated. Therefore, the most likely candidate is ""START"", where the second letter is T.

""START"" fits the pattern: S T A R T.

We must check if it violates any feedback:
- Previous feedback for ""roast"": 
  - R in position 1: not present in position 1? But in ""START"", R is in position 4, not 1 -> so '-' was correct.
  - O: not in word -> x correct.
  - A: correct position -> ✓
  - S in position 4: but in ""START"", S is in position 1 -> so not in position 4 -> '-' correct.
  - T in position 5: ✓

For ""crane"": already consistent.

For ""smart"":
  - S: ✓ (position 1)
  - M: x (not in ""START"")
  - A: ✓
  - R: ✓ (position 4)
  - T: ✓ (position 5)

So the feedback for ""smart"" also matches ""START"".

Moreover, we know that T is already in position 5, and ""START"" has an additional T in position 2. The game allows duplicate letters, and the feedback for T in ""roast"" and ""smart"" only confirmed position 5, but a second T was not tested. However, since we got a check for T in position 5 in both guesses, and we didn't have T in position 2 in any prior guess, there is no contradiction.

Therefore, the word should be ""START"".

Alternatively, are there other possibilities? The pattern S _ A R T. We need a letter for the second position that is not C, E, N, O, M (ruled out). We considered:

- T: ""START""
- W: ""SWART"" (less common, meaning dark)
- P: ""SPART"" (not common, a fiber)
- But ""SHART"" is informal and may not be in the word list.

Given that ""START"" is a common word and fits, it is the most likely.

Since we used ""SMART"" and got four checks and one miss, we can deduce the correct word by replacing M with T.

So the next guess should be ""START"".

### Summary of Known Information:
1. **Position 1**: Must be **S** (✓ in ""smart"").
2. **Position 3**: Must be **A** (✓ in all guesses).
3. **Position 4**: Must be **R** (✓ in ""smart"").
4. **Position 5**: Must be **T** (✓ in ""roast"" and ""smart"").
5. **Position 2**: Unknown but cannot be:  
   - **M** (x in ""smart""),  
   - **C**, **E**, **N** (x in ""crane""),  
   - **O** (x in ""roast"").  
6. The word pattern is: **S _ A R T**.

### Deduction:
- The only common English word fitting **S _ A R T** is **START** (with **T** in position 2).  
- ""START"" satisfies all feedback:  
  - **S** (position 1), **A** (position 3), **R** (position 4), **T** (position 5) all match confirmed positions.  
  - The second **T** is allowed (duplicates are permissible in Wordle rules), and no feedback conflicts with this.  
- Other words like ""SWART"" or ""SPART"" are either less common or invalid per the word list.
