We are starting the game. We have no prior information about the secret word.
 Since this is the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 Common starting words in Wordle often include letters that are frequent in English and that cover multiple common vowels and consonants.
 A good starting word might be ""CRATE"" because it contains common letters: C, R, A, T, E.
 However, let's consider another popular one: ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the accumulated wealth of an economy) but note that it might be less common.
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a very popular starting word because it contains common letters and leaves room for process of elimination.

 But note: the problem does not specify that we are using the official Wordle word list, but we know that the guess must be a valid English word.

 I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word. It includes S, L, A, T, E which are common letters.

 Let me double-check: in the English language, vowels are very important. We have A and E (two vowels) and three consonants that are common.

 We can also consider ""CRANE"". But I'll stick with ""SLATE"".

 If we don't get any feedback we'll adjust accordingly in the next guess.

 Therefore, my first guess is SLATE.
</think>
I need to make the first guess without any prior information. A good starting word should maximize the potential information by covering common letters and including both vowels and consonants. The letters S, L, A, T, and E are frequent in English, and ""SLATE"" provides diverse coverage. If the secret word contains any of these letters, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""SLATE"": 
 S: (-) meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position.
 L: (x) meaning L is not in the word.
 A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
 T: (x) meaning T is not in the word.
 E: (-) meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters S and E, but not in the positions they were in ""SLATE"".
 - The secret word does not contain L, A, or T.

 Since S is in the word but not in the first position, and E is in the word but not in the last position.

 Also, we have eliminated the letters L, A, T.

 We have 5 more guesses.

 For the next guess, we need to:
 1. Include S and E (because they are in the word) but in different positions than the first guess.
    - In the first guess, S was in position 1 and E was in position 5.
    - So in the new guess, S cannot be in position 1 and E cannot be in position 5.
 2. Avoid using L, A, T.

 We also want to use other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Has S in a position other than 1 (so positions 2,3,4,5) but note: we know E is in the word and not in position 5, so E could be in 1,2,3,4.
 - Has E in a position other than 5 (so 1,2,3,4).
 - Does not have L, A, T.

 We also want to cover new common letters to maximize information.

 Common letters we haven't tried: R, I, O, N, C, U, D, etc.

 Since S is in the word and not at position 1, and E is in the word and not at position 5, let's try to put S in position 2 and E in position 1? But note: we don't know if E can be at position 1.

 Alternatively, we can try to put S in position 3 and E in position 2? 

 We need to form a valid English word.

 Let's try to think of words that have S and E, and avoid L, A, T.

 Possibilities: 
 - We could try ""RESIN"" but that has I and N. But note: we don't know about R, I, N yet. However, we must avoid putting S in position 1? Actually, we can put S in any position except 1? But wait: the feedback for S was that it is in the word but not in position 1. So we can put S in positions 2,3,4,5. Similarly, E cannot be in position 5.

 But note: the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5. So we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, we must also consider that the word must not have L, A, T.

 Let me try to come up with a word that has S and E, and three new letters.

 Example: 
 - ""PESKY"": P, E, S, K, Y -> E is in position 2? But wait: 
   Position 1: P, 2: E, 3: S, 4: K, 5: Y.
   In this word, S is in position 3 (which is allowed) and E is in position 2 (allowed). 
   But we don't know if P, K, Y are in the word.

 However, we can also consider other words.

 Another idea: ""CRESS"" but that has two S's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But the feedback didn't indicate duplicate, so we can't assume.

 But note: the feedback for ""SLATE"" only showed one S and one E. If there were two S's, we would have seen two S's with feedback? Actually, no: because the feedback is per letter in the guess. If the secret word has two S's, then if we guess one S and it is in the wrong position, we would get one '-' for that S. But if we guess a word with two S's, then we might get feedback for both.

 However, in this case, we only have one S in the guess, so we don't know.

 Let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""SPIRE"" -> 
   S is in position 1? But we cannot put S in position 1 because the feedback said S is not in position 1. So ""SPIRE"" is invalid because it puts S at position 1.

 How about ""EPSOM""? But that is a proper noun? We need a common word. Also, E is at position 1 and S at position 4? 
   Positions: 1:E, 2:P, 3:S, 4:O, 5:M -> but E is at position 1 and that is allowed? The feedback only said E is not at position 5, so position 1 is okay.

 But is ""EPSOM"" a valid word? It's a salt, but might be accepted. However, let's try to use more common words.

 Another word: ""DENSE"" -> but that has two E's? And S at position 3? 
   Positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:N, 4:S, 5:E -> but we have E at position 5? We cannot put E at position 5 because the feedback said E is not at position 5. So that's invalid.

 How about ""MESSY"": 
   M, E, S, S, Y -> but two S's? And E at position 2, S at positions 3 and 4? But we are putting S in two positions. We don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we are putting E at position 2 (allowed) and S at position 3 (allowed) and 4 (allowed). But we are using two S's and we don't know if that's necessary.

 We want to avoid using duplicate letters unless necessary because it might not give as much information.

 Let me try: ""WISER"" -> 
   W, I, S, E, R -> 
   S is at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 
   We avoid L, A, T. 
   We introduce W, I, R.

 This seems like a good candidate.

 Another option: ""RISEN"" -> 
   R, I, S, E, N -> 
   S at position 3, E at position 4? 
   But note: the feedback for the first guess had E at position 5 and it was wrong, but here E is at position 4? That's allowed.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word has S and E, and we are putting S at position 3 and E at position 4.

 But we don't know if the secret word has R, I, N.

 I think ""WISER"" or ""RISEN"" are both good.

 Alternatively, ""CISES"" (plural of cis) but that might be obscure.

 Let's go with ""RISEN"": 
   R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, N at 5.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now we are putting E at position 4. That's a different position, so it's okay.

 However, we are putting S at position 3. In the first guess, S was at position 1 and now we are putting it at position 3. That's allowed.

 But wait: what if the secret word has S at position 3? Then we get a check. Or if it has S at position 2,4,5 then we get a dash.

 Similarly for E: we are putting it at position 4. If the secret word has E at position 4, we get a check. Otherwise, if it has E at position 1,2,3 then we get a dash.

 We also get information about R, I, N.

 Alternatively, we can try to put S in a position we haven't tried, like position 2? 

 For example: ""USHER"" -> 
   U, S, H, E, R -> 
   S at position 2 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 
   This also covers U, H, R.

 But we don't know if U, H, R are in the word.

 Another word: ""ASKED"" -> but we cannot use A because we know A is not in the word.

 So we must avoid A.

 After considering, I think ""RISEN"" is a good choice.

 But note: we are putting E at position 4. The secret word has E but not at position 5. It could be at position 4? We don't know.

 We are also putting S at position 3. The secret word has S but not at position 1. It could be at position 3? We don't know.

 So let's go with ""RISEN"".

 However, we must ensure that ""RISEN"" is a valid word. Yes, it is (past participle of rise).

 Therefore, I will guess ""RISEN"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has the letter R? We don't know. We are trying to find out.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't reuse the same positions for S and E? Actually, we are forced to put S and E in positions that are not the ones we tried before? Not exactly: we can put S in any position except 1, and E in any position except 5. So position 3 for S and 4 for E are new.

 So I think it's fine.

 Let me think of another word that puts S in a different position? For example, position 4? 

 Word: ""PURSE"" -> 
   P, U, R, S, E -> 
   S at position 4, E at position 5? But we cannot put E at position 5! Because the feedback said E is not at position 5. So that's invalid.

 How about ""POSSE"" -> but that has two S's and E at position 5? Invalid.

 Another: ""HOSED"" -> 
   H, O, S, E, D -> 
   S at position 3, E at position 4? That's the same as ""RISEN"". And we avoid A, L, T.

 But we have H, O, D. 

 I think ""RISEN"" is as good as any.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E at the beginning? 

 Word: ""ENSUE"" -> 
   E at position 1, N at 2, S at 3, U at 4, E at 5? But we cannot put E at position 5. So invalid.

 How about ""ESSAY"" -> but we cannot use A (because we know A is not in the word) and also we have two S's? And E at position 1? 
   But we have A which is eliminated -> invalid.

 After careful thought, I'll go with ""RISEN"".

<guess>RISEN</guess>

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""SLATE"":
- S is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (marked with `-`).
- L, A, and T are not in the secret word (marked with `x`).

For the next guess:
- Must include S and E (since they are in the word), but S cannot be in position 1 and E cannot be in position 5.
- Must avoid L, A, and T entirely.
- Should introduce new common letters to maximize information (e.g., R, I, N).

The word ""RISEN"" fits these criteria:
- Places S in position 3 (not position 1).
- Places E in position 4 (not position 5).
- Uses new letters R, I, and N.
- Is a valid English word.

This guess will help test positions for S and E while gathering information about R, I, and N.

 For example: ""USHER"" -> 
   U, S, H, E, R -> 
   S at position 2 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 
   This also covers U, H, R.

 But we don't know if U, H, R are in the word.

 Another word: ""ASKED"" -> but we cannot use A because we know A is not in the word.

 So we must avoid A.

 After considering, I think ""RISEN"" is a good choice.

 But note: we are putting E at position 4. The secret word has E but not at position 5. It could be at position 4? We don't know.

 We are also putting S at position 3. The secret word has S but not at position 1. It could be at position 3? We don't know.

 So let's go with ""RISEN"".

 However, we must ensure that ""RISEN"" is a valid word. Yes, it is (past participle of rise).

 Therefore, I will guess ""RISEN"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has the letter R? We don't know. We are trying to find out.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't reuse the same positions for S and E? Actually, we are forced to put S and E in positions that are not the ones we tried before? Not exactly: we can put S in any position except 1, and E in any position except 5. So position 3 for S and 4 for E are new.

 So I think it's fine.

 Let me think of another word that puts S in a different position? For example, position 4? 

 Word: ""PURSE"" -> 
   P, U, R, S, E -> 
   S at position 4, E at position 5? But we cannot put E at position 5! Because the feedback said E is not at position 5. So that's invalid.

 How about ""POSSE"" -> but that has two S's and E at position 5? Invalid.

 Another: ""HOSED"" -> 
   H, O, S, E, D -> 
   S at position 3, E at position 4? That's the same as ""RISEN"". And we avoid A, L, T.

 But we have H, O, D. 

 I think ""RISEN"" is as good as any.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E at the beginning? 

 Word: ""ENSUE"" -> 
   E at position 1, N at 2, S at 3, U at 4, E at 5? But we cannot put E at position 5. So invalid.

 How about ""ESSAY"" -> but we cannot use A (because we know A is not in the word) and also we have two S's? And E at position 1? 
   But we have A which is eliminated -> invalid.

 After careful thought, I'll go with ""RISEN"".

<guess>RISEN</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""SLATE"":
- S is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (marked with `-`).
- L, A, and T are not in the secret word (marked with `x`).

For the next guess:
- Must include S and E (since they are in the word), but S cannot be in position 1 and E cannot be in position 5.
- Must avoid L, A, and T entirely.
- Should introduce new common letters to maximize information (e.g., R, I, N).

The word ""RISEN"" fits these criteria:
- Places S in position 3 (not position 1).
- Places E in position 4 (not position 5).
- Uses new letters R, I, and N.
- Is a valid English word.

This guess will help test positions for S and E while gathering information about R, I, and N.",Guess 2: RISEN -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-) N(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,VERSO,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior information about the secret word.
 Since this is the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 Common starting words in Wordle often include letters that are frequent in English and that cover multiple common vowels and consonants.
 A good starting word might be ""CRATE"" because it contains common letters: C, R, A, T, E.
 However, let's consider another popular one: ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the accumulated wealth of an economy) but note that it might be less common.
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a very popular starting word because it contains common letters and leaves room for process of elimination.

 But note: the problem does not specify that we are using the official Wordle word list, but we know that the guess must be a valid English word.

 I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word. It includes S, L, A, T, E which are common letters.

 Let me double-check: in the English language, vowels are very important. We have A and E (two vowels) and three consonants that are common.

 We can also consider ""CRANE"". But I'll stick with ""SLATE"".

 If we don't get any feedback we'll adjust accordingly in the next guess.

 Therefore, my first guess is SLATE.I need to make the first guess without any prior information. A good starting word should maximize the potential information by covering common letters and including both vowels and consonants. The letters S, L, A, T, and E are frequent in English, and ""SLATE"" provides diverse coverage. If the secret word contains any of these letters, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

<guess>SLATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""SLATE"": 
 S: (-) meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position.
 L: (x) meaning L is not in the word.
 A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
 T: (x) meaning T is not in the word.
 E: (-) meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters S and E, but not in the positions they were in ""SLATE"".
 - The secret word does not contain L, A, or T.

 Since S is in the word but not in the first position, and E is in the word but not in the last position.

 Also, we have eliminated the letters L, A, T.

 We have 5 more guesses.

 For the next guess, we need to:
 1. Include S and E (because they are in the word) but in different positions than the first guess.
    - In the first guess, S was in position 1 and E was in position 5.
    - So in the new guess, S cannot be in position 1 and E cannot be in position 5.
 2. Avoid using L, A, T.

 We also want to use other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Has S in a position other than 1 (so positions 2,3,4,5) but note: we know E is in the word and not in position 5, so E could be in 1,2,3,4.
 - Has E in a position other than 5 (so 1,2,3,4).
 - Does not have L, A, T.

 We also want to cover new common letters to maximize information.

 Common letters we haven't tried: R, I, O, N, C, U, D, etc.

 Since S is in the word and not at position 1, and E is in the word and not at position 5, let's try to put S in position 2 and E in position 1? But note: we don't know if E can be at position 1.

 Alternatively, we can try to put S in position 3 and E in position 2? 

 We need to form a valid English word.

 Let's try to think of words that have S and E, and avoid L, A, T.

 Possibilities: 
 - We could try ""RESIN"" but that has I and N. But note: we don't know about R, I, N yet. However, we must avoid putting S in position 1? Actually, we can put S in any position except 1? But wait: the feedback for S was that it is in the word but not in position 1. So we can put S in positions 2,3,4,5. Similarly, E cannot be in position 5.

 But note: the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5. So we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, we must also consider that the word must not have L, A, T.

 Let me try to come up with a word that has S and E, and three new letters.

 Example: 
 - ""PESKY"": P, E, S, K, Y -> E is in position 2? But wait: 
   Position 1: P, 2: E, 3: S, 4: K, 5: Y.
   In this word, S is in position 3 (which is allowed) and E is in position 2 (allowed). 
   But we don't know if P, K, Y are in the word.

 However, we can also consider other words.

 Another idea: ""CRESS"" but that has two S's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But the feedback didn't indicate duplicate, so we can't assume.

 But note: the feedback for ""SLATE"" only showed one S and one E. If there were two S's, we would have seen two S's with feedback? Actually, no: because the feedback is per letter in the guess. If the secret word has two S's, then if we guess one S and it is in the wrong position, we would get one '-' for that S. But if we guess a word with two S's, then we might get feedback for both.

 However, in this case, we only have one S in the guess, so we don't know.

 Let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""SPIRE"" -> 
   S is in position 1? But we cannot put S in position 1 because the feedback said S is not in position 1. So ""SPIRE"" is invalid because it puts S at position 1.

 How about ""EPSOM""? But that is a proper noun? We need a common word. Also, E is at position 1 and S at position 4? 
   Positions: 1:E, 2:P, 3:S, 4:O, 5:M -> but E is at position 1 and that is allowed? The feedback only said E is not at position 5, so position 1 is okay.

 But is ""EPSOM"" a valid word? It's a salt, but might be accepted. However, let's try to use more common words.

 Another word: ""DENSE"" -> but that has two E's? And S at position 3? 
   Positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:N, 4:S, 5:E -> but we have E at position 5? We cannot put E at position 5 because the feedback said E is not at position 5. So that's invalid.

 How about ""MESSY"": 
   M, E, S, S, Y -> but two S's? And E at position 2, S at positions 3 and 4? But we are putting S in two positions. We don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we are putting E at position 2 (allowed) and S at position 3 (allowed) and 4 (allowed). But we are using two S's and we don't know if that's necessary.

 We want to avoid using duplicate letters unless necessary because it might not give as much information.

 Let me try: ""WISER"" -> 
   W, I, S, E, R -> 
   S is at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 
   We avoid L, A, T. 
   We introduce W, I, R.

 This seems like a good candidate.

 Another option: ""RISEN"" -> 
   R, I, S, E, N -> 
   S at position 3, E at position 4? 
   But note: the feedback for the first guess had E at position 5 and it was wrong, but here E is at position 4? That's allowed.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word has S and E, and we are putting S at position 3 and E at position 4.

 But we don't know if the secret word has R, I, N.

 I think ""WISER"" or ""RISEN"" are both good.

 Alternatively, ""CISES"" (plural of cis) but that might be obscure.

 Let's go with ""RISEN"": 
   R at 1, I at 2, S at 3, E at 4, N at 5.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now we are putting E at position 4. That's a different position, so it's okay.

 However, we are putting S at position 3. In the first guess, S was at position 1 and now we are putting it at position 3. That's allowed.

 But wait: what if the secret word has S at position 3? Then we get a check. Or if it has S at position 2,4,5 then we get a dash.

 Similarly for E: we are putting it at position 4. If the secret word has E at position 4, we get a check. Otherwise, if it has E at position 1,2,3 then we get a dash.

 We also get information about R, I, N.

 Alternatively, we can try to put S in a position we haven't tried, like position 2? 

 For example: ""USHER"" -> 
   U, S, H, E, R -> 
   S at position 2 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 
   This also covers U, H, R.

 But we don't know if U, H, R are in the word.

 Another word: ""ASKED"" -> but we cannot use A because we know A is not in the word.

 So we must avoid A.

 After considering, I think ""RISEN"" is a good choice.

 But note: we are putting E at position 4. The secret word has E but not at position 5. It could be at position 4? We don't know.

 We are also putting S at position 3. The secret word has S but not at position 1. It could be at position 3? We don't know.

 So let's go with ""RISEN"".

 However, we must ensure that ""RISEN"" is a valid word. Yes, it is (past participle of rise).

 Therefore, I will guess ""RISEN"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has the letter R? We don't know. We are trying to find out.

 So I think it's fine.

 But we have H, O, D. 

 I think ""RISEN"" is as good as any.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E at the beginning? 

 Word: ""ENSUE"" -> 
   E at position 1, N at 2, S at 3, U at 4, E at 5? But we cannot put E at position 5. So invalid.

   But we have A which is eliminated -> invalid.

 After careful thought, I'll go with ""RISEN"".

For example, position 4? \n\n Word: ""PURSE"" -> \n   P, U, R, S, E -> \n   S at position 4, E at position 5? But we cannot put E at position 5! Because the feedback said E is not at position 5.

That\'s the same as ""RISEN"". And we avoid A, L, T.\n\n But we have H, O, D. \n\n I think ""RISEN"" is as good as any.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put E at the beginning? \n\n Word: ""ENSUE"" -> \n   E at position 1, N at 2, S at 3, U at 4, E at 5? But we cannot put E at position 5. So invalid.\n\n How about ""ESSAY"" -> but we cannot use A (because we know A is not in the word) and also we have two S\'s?

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: SLATE -> S(-), L(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- L, A, T are not in the word.

Guess 2: RISEN -> R(-), I(x), S(-), E(-), N(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- S is in the word but not in position 3 (since in RISEN, S is at position 3 and we got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (since in RISEN, E is at position 4 and we got '-').
- I and N are not in the word.

So, combining the information:

Letters in the word: S, E, R (from the '-' in both guesses) and we know they are present.

Letters not in the word: L, A, T, I, N (from the 'x').

We also know the positions that are incorrect for the known letters:
- S: not in position 1 (from SLATE) and not in position 3 (from RISEN). So S cannot be at 1 or 3.
- E: not in position 5 (from SLATE) and not in position 4 (from RISEN). So E cannot be at 4 or 5.
- R: not in position 1 (from RISEN).

We have 5 positions and we know the word has R, S, E, and two more letters that we haven't found yet.

We have used the letters: S, L, A, T, E, R, I, N (from the two guesses). The letters that are in the word are S, E, R. The rest (L, A, T, I, N) are out.

So the word has exactly the letters: R, S, E, and two other letters that are not L, A, T, I, N.

We need to find a word that:
- Contains R, S, E (each at least once, but note: we don't know about duplicates, so we assume no duplicates for now to be safe).
- Does not contain L, A, T, I, N.
- S is not in position 1 or 3.
- E is not in position 4 or 5.
- R is not in position 1.

Also, we have to consider the positions we haven't tried for S and E.

Possible positions for S: since it cannot be at 1 or 3, it can be at 2, 4, or 5.
Possible positions for E: cannot be at 4 or 5, so it can be at 1, 2, or 3.

But note: we also have R which cannot be at position 1.

We need to introduce two new letters. We should choose common letters that we haven't tried.

Letters we haven't tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

We want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible and also try to place R, S, E in positions that are still possible.

Let's list the possible positions for each:

Position 1: cannot be R (from feedback) and cannot be S (from first feedback). Also, we don't know about E? E can be at position 1? Yes, because the feedback only said E is not at 4 or 5. So position 1 is allowed for E.

Similarly, position 2: allowed for S and E and R? We don't have feedback for R at position 2? Only that R is not at 1, so it can be at 2,3,4,5.

But for S, position 2 is allowed.

Position 3: E can be at 3? Yes, because we only know E is not at 4 or 5. But S cannot be at 3 (from second feedback). R can be at 3.

Position 4: S can be at 4 (since not forbidden), but E cannot be at 4. R can be at 4.

Position 5: S can be at 5, but E cannot be at 5.

So, for the next guess, we need to form a word that:
- Has R, S, E in positions that are allowed.
- Two new letters (not L,A,T,I,N).

We also want to test new positions for S and E.

For example, we haven't tried E at position 1 or 2 or 3. We tried E at 5 (in SLATE) and at 4 (in RISEN) and both were wrong. So we need to try E at 1,2, or 3.

Similarly, for S: we tried at 1 and 3, so we need to try at 2,4, or 5.

We also have R to place, which we tried at position 1 (in RISEN) and it was wrong, so we can try R at 2,3,4,5.

Now, let's think of words that fit.

Option: put E at position 1? Then we can have:

E _ _ _ _

But we need R and S in the word. And we cannot have S at 1? But E is at 1, so that's fine.

For example: E _ S _ _ -> but S cannot be at 3? We know S cannot be at 3. So we cannot put S at 3.

We can put S at 2? Then: E S _ _ _

But we need R somewhere. And two new letters.

What word? ""ESPRY""? Not a common word.

""ESKAR""? Not common.

Alternatively, put E at position 2.

Then: _ E _ _ _

We need S and R. S can be at 2? But E is at 2, so S must be at 4 or 5? Because S cannot be at 1 or 3, and 2 is taken by E.

So S at 4 or 5.

R can be at 3,4,5? But if S is at 4, then R can be at 3 or 5? 

Example: _ E R S _ -> but we have E at 2, R at 3, S at 4. Then we need one more letter? Actually, 5 letters.

But we have E at 2, R at 3, S at 4. Then we need two more letters? No, we have three positions: 1, 5.

The word would be ? E R S ? 

But we need to fill position 1 and 5 with new letters.

Also, we have to include E, R, S and two others? Actually, the word must have exactly these three and two more.

But note: we are including E, R, S, and two new letters.

So for the pattern: position 1: ?, position 2: E, position 3: R, position 4: S, position 5: ?

But we know that S cannot be at position 4? Wait, no: we only know S cannot be at 1 or 3. Position 4 is allowed for S.

Similarly, E at 2 is allowed (since we only know E not at 4 or 5).

R at 3: we don't have feedback for R at 3? So it's allowed.

So a word like: ? E R S ?

What words? ""PERSU"" (not a word), ""VERSO"" (a word, meaning a page in a book).

""VERSO"": V, E, R, S, O.

Check the letters: V, E, R, S, O.

We know E, R, S are in the word. V and O are new.

We avoid L, A, T, I, N.

Now, check positions:
- E at position 2: allowed (not 4 or 5)
- R at position 3: allowed (we only know R not at 1, so 3 is fine)
- S at position 4: allowed (not 1 or 3)

Also, we are testing V and O.

But note: we are putting S at 4. We haven't tried that position for S before.

Similarly, E at 2 is new.

So this seems good.

Another option: put E at position 3? 

Then: _ _ E _ _

We need S and R. S can be at 2,4,5.

But we cannot put S at 3? Because E is at 3.

So S at 2,4, or 5.

R can be at 2,4,5? But if we put S at 2, then R can be at 4 or 5.

Example: _ S E _ R -> but S at 2 is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tried S at 2. And E at 3 is allowed? We haven't tried E at 3? We tried E at 5 and 4, but 3 is new.

But we have to form a word: ""USERP"" not a word. ""USHER"" but we cannot use H? We can, but we have U and H? But we don't know about U and H.

But in ""USHER"": U, S, H, E, R -> 
- S at 2: allowed
- E at 4? But we are putting E at 3? In ""USHER"", E is at position 4? Let me see: U(1), S(2), H(3), E(4), R(5). So E is at 4? But we cannot put E at 4 because we know from RISEN that E is not at 4.

So that's invalid.

How about ""RESOW"": but R at 1 is not allowed.

Another: ""CRESS"" but C at 1? Then R at 2? But we have R at 2? Then E at 3? Then S at 4 and 5? But we cannot have E at 3? We can, but we are putting E at 3? And S at 4 and 5? But we don't want duplicates.

But let's avoid duplicates.

Back to E at 3: we can have a word like: _ _ E S _ -> but S at 4 is allowed. Then we need R somewhere.

For example: C R E S T -> but T is eliminated? We cannot use T.

T is not allowed.

B R E S S -> but two S's and we avoid duplicates? Also, B is new.

But ""BRESS"" is not a word.

P R E S T -> T is out.

So it's hard to find a word with E at 3 and S at 4.

Put S at 5? Then: _ _ E _ S

Example: C R E W S -> ""CREWS""

Check: C, R, E, W, S.

Positions: 
- R at 2? We don't know if R can be at 2? We only know R not at 1, so 2 is allowed.
- E at 3: allowed (we haven't tried E at 3)
- S at 5: allowed (we haven't tried S at 5, and we know S not at 1 or 3, so 5 is fine)

Letters: C, R, E, W, S. We have R, E, S and new letters C and W. Avoided L,A,T,I,N.

""CREWS"" is a valid word.

But note: we are putting E at 3. We haven't tried that before.

Similarly, S at 5 is new.

But we also have the option of ""VERSO"" with E at 2 and S at 4.

Which one is better? Both are good.

We can also consider putting S at 2 and E at 1? 

E at 1: allowed? Yes.

Then: E _ _ _ _

S at 2: allowed? Yes, because we haven't tried S at 2 and it's not forbidden.

Then: E S _ _ _

We need R and two new letters.

But we cannot put R at 1? But E is at 1, so R can be at 3,4,5.

Example: E S C R O -> ""ESCRO"" not a word.

E S P R Y -> ""ESPRY"" not common.

E S K E R -> but E is repeated? And we have E at 1 and then at 5? But we cannot put E at 5? Because E is not at 5. So invalid.

So it's hard to form a word with E at 1 and S at 2.

Therefore, let's choose between ""VERSO"" and ""CREWS"".

In ""VERSO"": 
- We test E at 2, R at 3, S at 4, and new letters V and O.

In ""CREWS"":
- We test R at 2, E at 3, S at 5, and new letters C and W.

We have not tried position 2 for E or S? In ""VERSO"", E is at 2 and S at 4. In ""CREWS"", E is at 3 and S at 5.

We also have R: in ""VERSO"" at 3, in ""CREWS"" at 2.

We haven't tried R at 2 or 3? In RISEN, R was at 1 and it was wrong, but we haven't tried R at 2 or 3.

So both are new positions.

But note: we know R is in the word, but we don't know where. Similarly for S and E.

I think both are equally good. Let's pick ""VERSO"" because it uses O which is a vowel and might be common.

But we already have two vowels? E and ... O is a vowel. But we don't know if O is in the word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common consonants.

Another word: ""PURSE"" -> but E is at 5? We cannot put E at 5. So invalid.

""ROUSE"": 
- R at 1? But R cannot be at 1. So invalid.

""SOBER"": 
- S at 1? But S cannot be at 1. Invalid.

""SEVER"": 
- S at 1? Invalid.

""ERS"" something? But we need 5 letters.

I think ""VERSO"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: V-E-R-S-O.

Positions: 
1: V (new)
2: E (allowed position for E? Yes, because E not at 4 or 5, so 2 is okay)
3: R (allowed, because R not at 1, so 3 is okay)
4: S (allowed, because S not at 1 or 3, so 4 is okay)
5: O (new)

And we avoid L,A,T,I,N.

So I'll go with ""VERSO"".

But wait, what if the secret word has O? We don't know. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can use ""DOWSE"" but E is at 5? Invalid.

""HOUSE"" -> E at 5? Invalid.

So ""VERSO"" seems acceptable.

Another option: ""VERGE"" -> but E is repeated? And we have E at 4? But we cannot put E at 4. Also, G is new.

But E at 4 is not allowed.

""VERGE"" has E at 4? V(1), E(2), R(3), G(4), E(5). So E at 2 and 5? But we cannot have E at 5? And also at 4? We have G at 4? The E at 4 is not present? Actually, the word has E at 2 and 5? But we cannot put E at 5.

So invalid.

Therefore, I choose ""VERSO"".

But note: ""VERSO"" might be a bit obscure? But it's in the word list.

To be safe, we can choose ""CREWS"": C-R-E-W-S.

Positions:
1: C (new)
2: R (allowed, because R not at 1? We know R is not at 1, but 2 is okay)
3: E (allowed, because E not at 4 or 5, so 3 is okay)
4: W (new)
5: S (allowed, because S not at 1 or 3, so 5 is okay)

This is also a valid word.

I think ""CREWS"" is more common.

But let me see: we have not tried position 2 for R? In RISEN, R was at 1. So 2 is new.

Similarly, E at 3 is new, S at 5 is new.

So both are good.

I'll go with ""CREWS"" because it's a common word.

But wait, in ""CREWS"", we are putting E at 3. We haven't tried that. And S at 5.

We also get to test C, R, W.

R is already known to be in the word, but we are testing its position.

So I think it's fine.

But note: we have two guesses that both seem good. Let me see if there's a word that tests more vowels? We have E, but we haven't tested O, U, etc.

In ""VERSO"" we test O, which is a vowel.

In ""CREWS"" we test no new vowel? W is a consonant.

But we don't know if the word has a vowel besides E? It must have at least one vowel, but we have E. It might have more.

But we are not required to test vowels necessarily.

I think either is fine.

I'll choose ""VERSO"" to test a different vowel.

But we already have E, and O is another vowel.

So let's go with ""VERSO"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: SLATE** → S(-), L(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)  
  - S and E are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 5, respectively.
  - L, A, T are not in the secret word.

- **Guess 2: RISEN** → R(-), I(x), S(-), E(-), N(x)  
  - R and S are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 3, respectively.
  - E is in the secret word but not in position 4.
  - I and N are not in the secret word.

### Key Insights
1. **Confirmed Letters in Secret Word**:  
   - R, S, E are present (each must appear at least once).
   - These letters cannot be in the following positions:  
     - R: Not position 1 (from RISEN).
     - S: Not positions 1 (from SLATE) or 3 (from RISEN). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
     - E: Not positions 4 (from RISEN) or 5 (from SLATE). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - L, A, T, I, N are not in the secret word (from ""x"" feedback).

3. **Unknown Letters**:  
   - The secret word has 5 letters: R, S, E, and two unknown letters (not L, A, T, I, N).
   - Common untested letters include vowels (O, U) and consonants (C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y).

4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include R, S, and E in allowed positions (see above).
   - Introduce new common letters to maximize information.
   - Avoid positions already ruled out for R, S, E.
   - Prioritize testing E in a new position (positions 1, 2, or 3) and S in a new position (positions 2, 4, or 5).

### Chosen Guess: VERSO
- **Word Breakdown**: V-E-R-S-O  
  - V (new), E (position 2), R (position 3), S (position 4), O (new).  
- **Why VERSO?**  
  - Tests E in position 2 (allowed, not 4 or 5).  
  - Tests S in position 4 (allowed, not 1 or 3).  
  - Tests R in position 3 (allowed, not 1).  
  - Introduces two new common letters: V and O (vowel).  
  - Avoids excluded letters (L, A, T, I, N).  
  - Valid English word (meaning: a left-hand page in a book).  
- **Expected Information Gain**:  
  - Confirms/refines positions for R, S, E.  
  - Checks if V or O are in the secret word.  
  - Narrows down possibilities for remaining letters.

<guess>VERSO</guess>",VERSO,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: SLATE -> S(-), L(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- L, A, T are not in the word.

Guess 2: RISEN -> R(-), I(x), S(-), E(-), N(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- S is in the word but not in position 3 (since in RISEN, S is at position 3 and we got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (since in RISEN, E is at position 4 and we got '-').
- I and N are not in the word.

So, combining the information:

Letters in the word: S, E, R (from the '-' in both guesses) and we know they are present.

Letters not in the word: L, A, T, I, N (from the 'x').

We also know the positions that are incorrect for the known letters:
- S: not in position 1 (from SLATE) and not in position 3 (from RISEN). So S cannot be at 1 or 3.
- E: not in position 5 (from SLATE) and not in position 4 (from RISEN). So E cannot be at 4 or 5.
- R: not in position 1 (from RISEN).

We have 5 positions and we know the word has R, S, E, and two more letters that we haven't found yet.

We have used the letters: S, L, A, T, E, R, I, N (from the two guesses). The letters that are in the word are S, E, R. The rest (L, A, T, I, N) are out.

So the word has exactly the letters: R, S, E, and two other letters that are not L, A, T, I, N.

We need to find a word that:
- Contains R, S, E (each at least once, but note: we don't know about duplicates, so we assume no duplicates for now to be safe).
- Does not contain L, A, T, I, N.
- S is not in position 1 or 3.
- E is not in position 4 or 5.
- R is not in position 1.

Also, we have to consider the positions we haven't tried for S and E.

Possible positions for S: since it cannot be at 1 or 3, it can be at 2, 4, or 5.
Possible positions for E: cannot be at 4 or 5, so it can be at 1, 2, or 3.

But note: we also have R which cannot be at position 1.

We need to introduce two new letters. We should choose common letters that we haven't tried.

Letters we haven't tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

We want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible and also try to place R, S, E in positions that are still possible.

Let's list the possible positions for each:

Position 1: cannot be R (from feedback) and cannot be S (from first feedback). Also, we don't know about E? E can be at position 1? Yes, because the feedback only said E is not at 4 or 5. So position 1 is allowed for E.

Similarly, position 2: allowed for S and E and R? We don't have feedback for R at position 2? Only that R is not at 1, so it can be at 2,3,4,5.

But for S, position 2 is allowed.

Position 3: E can be at 3? Yes, because we only know E is not at 4 or 5. But S cannot be at 3 (from second feedback). R can be at 3.

Position 4: S can be at 4 (since not forbidden), but E cannot be at 4. R can be at 4.

Position 5: S can be at 5, but E cannot be at 5.

So, for the next guess, we need to form a word that:
- Has R, S, E in positions that are allowed.
- Two new letters (not L,A,T,I,N).

We also want to test new positions for S and E.

For example, we haven't tried E at position 1 or 2 or 3. We tried E at 5 (in SLATE) and at 4 (in RISEN) and both were wrong. So we need to try E at 1,2, or 3.

Similarly, for S: we tried at 1 and 3, so we need to try at 2,4, or 5.

We also have R to place, which we tried at position 1 (in RISEN) and it was wrong, so we can try R at 2,3,4,5.

Now, let's think of words that fit.

Option: put E at position 1? Then we can have:

E _ _ _ _

But we need R and S in the word. And we cannot have S at 1? But E is at 1, so that's fine.

For example: E _ S _ _ -> but S cannot be at 3? We know S cannot be at 3. So we cannot put S at 3.

We can put S at 2? Then: E S _ _ _

But we need R somewhere. And two new letters.

What word? ""ESPRY""? Not a common word.

""ESKAR""? Not common.

Alternatively, put E at position 2.

Then: _ E _ _ _

We need S and R. S can be at 2? But E is at 2, so S must be at 4 or 5? Because S cannot be at 1 or 3, and 2 is taken by E.

So S at 4 or 5.

R can be at 3,4,5? But if S is at 4, then R can be at 3 or 5? 

Example: _ E R S _ -> but we have E at 2, R at 3, S at 4. Then we need one more letter? Actually, 5 letters.

But we have E at 2, R at 3, S at 4. Then we need two more letters? No, we have three positions: 1, 5.

The word would be ? E R S ? 

But we need to fill position 1 and 5 with new letters.

Also, we have to include E, R, S and two others? Actually, the word must have exactly these three and two more.

But note: we are including E, R, S, and two new letters.

So for the pattern: position 1: ?, position 2: E, position 3: R, position 4: S, position 5: ?

But we know that S cannot be at position 4? Wait, no: we only know S cannot be at 1 or 3. Position 4 is allowed for S.

Similarly, E at 2 is allowed (since we only know E not at 4 or 5).

R at 3: we don't have feedback for R at 3? So it's allowed.

So a word like: ? E R S ?

What words? ""PERSU"" (not a word), ""VERSO"" (a word, meaning a page in a book).

""VERSO"": V, E, R, S, O.

Check the letters: V, E, R, S, O.

We know E, R, S are in the word. V and O are new.

We avoid L, A, T, I, N.

Now, check positions:
- E at position 2: allowed (not 4 or 5)
- R at position 3: allowed (we only know R not at 1, so 3 is fine)
- S at position 4: allowed (not 1 or 3)

Also, we are testing V and O.

But note: we are putting S at 4. We haven't tried that position for S before.

Similarly, E at 2 is new.

So this seems good.

Another option: put E at position 3? 

Then: _ _ E _ _

We need S and R. S can be at 2,4,5.

But we cannot put S at 3? Because E is at 3.

So S at 2,4, or 5.

R can be at 2,4,5? But if we put S at 2, then R can be at 4 or 5.

Example: _ S E _ R -> but S at 2 is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tried S at 2. And E at 3 is allowed? We haven't tried E at 3? We tried E at 5 and 4, but 3 is new.

But we have to form a word: ""USERP"" not a word. ""USHER"" but we cannot use H? We can, but we have U and H? But we don't know about U and H.

But in ""USHER"": U, S, H, E, R -> 
- S at 2: allowed
- E at 4? But we are putting E at 3? In ""USHER"", E is at position 4? Let me see: U(1), S(2), H(3), E(4), R(5). So E is at 4? But we cannot put E at 4 because we know from RISEN that E is not at 4.

So that's invalid.

How about ""RESOW"": but R at 1 is not allowed.

Another: ""CRESS"" but C at 1? Then R at 2? But we have R at 2? Then E at 3? Then S at 4 and 5? But we cannot have E at 3? We can, but we are putting E at 3? And S at 4 and 5? But we don't want duplicates.

But let's avoid duplicates.

Back to E at 3: we can have a word like: _ _ E S _ -> but S at 4 is allowed. Then we need R somewhere.

For example: C R E S T -> but T is eliminated? We cannot use T.

T is not allowed.

B R E S S -> but two S's and we avoid duplicates? Also, B is new.

But ""BRESS"" is not a word.

P R E S T -> T is out.

So it's hard to find a word with E at 3 and S at 4.

Put S at 5? Then: _ _ E _ S

Example: C R E W S -> ""CREWS""

Check: C, R, E, W, S.

Positions: 
- R at 2? We don't know if R can be at 2? We only know R not at 1, so 2 is allowed.
- E at 3: allowed (we haven't tried E at 3)
- S at 5: allowed (we haven't tried S at 5, and we know S not at 1 or 3, so 5 is fine)

Letters: C, R, E, W, S. We have R, E, S and new letters C and W. Avoided L,A,T,I,N.

""CREWS"" is a valid word.

But note: we are putting E at 3. We haven't tried that before.

Similarly, S at 5 is new.

But we also have the option of ""VERSO"" with E at 2 and S at 4.

Which one is better? Both are good.

We can also consider putting S at 2 and E at 1? 

E at 1: allowed? Yes.

Then: E _ _ _ _

S at 2: allowed? Yes, because we haven't tried S at 2 and it's not forbidden.

Then: E S _ _ _

We need R and two new letters.

But we cannot put R at 1? But E is at 1, so R can be at 3,4,5.

Example: E S C R O -> ""ESCRO"" not a word.

E S P R Y -> ""ESPRY"" not common.

E S K E R -> but E is repeated? And we have E at 1 and then at 5? But we cannot put E at 5? Because E is not at 5. So invalid.

So it's hard to form a word with E at 1 and S at 2.

Therefore, let's choose between ""VERSO"" and ""CREWS"".

In ""VERSO"": 
- We test E at 2, R at 3, S at 4, and new letters V and O.

In ""CREWS"":
- We test R at 2, E at 3, S at 5, and new letters C and W.

We have not tried position 2 for E or S? In ""VERSO"", E is at 2 and S at 4. In ""CREWS"", E is at 3 and S at 5.

We also have R: in ""VERSO"" at 3, in ""CREWS"" at 2.

We haven't tried R at 2 or 3? In RISEN, R was at 1 and it was wrong, but we haven't tried R at 2 or 3.

So both are new positions.

But note: we know R is in the word, but we don't know where. Similarly for S and E.

I think both are equally good. Let's pick ""VERSO"" because it uses O which is a vowel and might be common.

But we already have two vowels? E and ... O is a vowel. But we don't know if O is in the word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common consonants.

Another word: ""PURSE"" -> but E is at 5? We cannot put E at 5. So invalid.

""ROUSE"": 
- R at 1? But R cannot be at 1. So invalid.

""SOBER"": 
- S at 1? But S cannot be at 1. Invalid.

""SEVER"": 
- S at 1? Invalid.

""ERS"" something? But we need 5 letters.

I think ""VERSO"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: V-E-R-S-O.

Positions: 
1: V (new)
2: E (allowed position for E? Yes, because E not at 4 or 5, so 2 is okay)
3: R (allowed, because R not at 1, so 3 is okay)
4: S (allowed, because S not at 1 or 3, so 4 is okay)
5: O (new)

And we avoid L,A,T,I,N.

So I'll go with ""VERSO"".

But wait, what if the secret word has O? We don't know. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can use ""DOWSE"" but E is at 5? Invalid.

""HOUSE"" -> E at 5? Invalid.

So ""VERSO"" seems acceptable.

Another option: ""VERGE"" -> but E is repeated? And we have E at 4? But we cannot put E at 4. Also, G is new.

But E at 4 is not allowed.

""VERGE"" has E at 4? V(1), E(2), R(3), G(4), E(5). So E at 2 and 5? But we cannot have E at 5? And also at 4? We have G at 4? The E at 4 is not present? Actually, the word has E at 2 and 5? But we cannot put E at 5.

So invalid.

Therefore, I choose ""VERSO"".

But note: ""VERSO"" might be a bit obscure? But it's in the word list.

To be safe, we can choose ""CREWS"": C-R-E-W-S.

Positions:
1: C (new)
2: R (allowed, because R not at 1? We know R is not at 1, but 2 is okay)
3: E (allowed, because E not at 4 or 5, so 3 is okay)
4: W (new)
5: S (allowed, because S not at 1 or 3, so 5 is okay)

This is also a valid word.

I think ""CREWS"" is more common.

But let me see: we have not tried position 2 for R? In RISEN, R was at 1. So 2 is new.

Similarly, E at 3 is new, S at 5 is new.

So both are good.

I'll go with ""CREWS"" because it's a common word.

But wait, in ""CREWS"", we are putting E at 3. We haven't tried that. And S at 5.

We also get to test C, R, W.

R is already known to be in the word, but we are testing its position.

So I think it's fine.

But note: we have two guesses that both seem good. Let me see if there's a word that tests more vowels? We have E, but we haven't tested O, U, etc.

In ""VERSO"" we test O, which is a vowel.

In ""CREWS"" we test no new vowel? W is a consonant.

But we don't know if the word has a vowel besides E? It must have at least one vowel, but we have E. It might have more.

But we are not required to test vowels necessarily.

I think either is fine.

I'll choose ""VERSO"" to test a different vowel.

But we already have E, and O is another vowel.

So let's go with ""VERSO"".

<guess>VERSO</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: SLATE** → S(-), L(x), A(x), T(x), E(-)  
  - S and E are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 5, respectively.
  - L, A, T are not in the secret word.

- **Guess 2: RISEN** → R(-), I(x), S(-), E(-), N(x)  
  - R and S are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 3, respectively.
  - E is in the secret word but not in position 4.
  - I and N are not in the secret word.

### Key Insights
1. **Confirmed Letters in Secret Word**:  
   - R, S, E are present (each must appear at least once).
   - These letters cannot be in the following positions:  
     - R: Not position 1 (from RISEN).
     - S: Not positions 1 (from SLATE) or 3 (from RISEN). Possible positions: 2, 4, or 5.
     - E: Not positions 4 (from RISEN) or 5 (from SLATE). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - L, A, T, I, N are not in the secret word (from ""x"" feedback).

3. **Unknown Letters**:  
   - The secret word has 5 letters: R, S, E, and two unknown letters (not L, A, T, I, N).
   - Common untested letters include vowels (O, U) and consonants (C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y).

4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include R, S, and E in allowed positions (see above).
   - Introduce new common letters to maximize information.
   - Avoid positions already ruled out for R, S, E.
   - Prioritize testing E in a new position (positions 1, 2, or 3) and S in a new position (positions 2, 4, or 5).

### Chosen Guess: VERSO
- **Word Breakdown**: V-E-R-S-O  
  - V (new), E (position 2), R (position 3), S (position 4), O (new).  
- **Why VERSO?**  
  - Tests E in position 2 (allowed, not 4 or 5).  
  - Tests S in position 4 (allowed, not 1 or 3).  
  - Tests R in position 3 (allowed, not 1).  
  - Introduces two new common letters: V and O (vowel).  
  - Avoids excluded letters (L, A, T, I, N).  
  - Valid English word (meaning: a left-hand page in a book).  
- **Expected Information Gain**:  
  - Confirms/refines positions for R, S, E.  
  - Checks if V or O are in the secret word.  
  - Narrows down possibilities for remaining letters.",Guess 3: VERSO -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) E(✓) R(✓) S(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
