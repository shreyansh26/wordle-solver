We are on the second guess. The previous guess was CRANE with feedback: C(x) means C is not in the secret word at all. R(x) means R is not in the secret word. A(x) means A is not in the secret word. N(-) means N is in the word but in the wrong position. E(-) means E is in the word but also in the wrong position.

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word does NOT contain C, R, A.
- It does contain N and E, but not in the positions they were in CRANE. Since CRANE had N at the 4th position and E at the 5th, those positions are incorrect for N and E.

Now, for our next guess, we need to:
- Avoid using C, R, A.
- Include N and E, but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively.
- Since the word has 5 letters, we need to guess a word that meets these constraints.

Also, we want to try to get more information about the secret word. We know the word contains N and E, and there are 3 other letters we don't know yet.

Let's think about common 5-letter words that have N and E, but without C, R, A.

We can try to position N and E in different places. Since in the first guess N was at position 4 and E at position 5, we should put them in other positions.

Possible positions for N: it can be at 1,2,3 but not 4 (since - means not in that position, but present elsewhere). Similarly, E cannot be at position 5.

Let me note: the feedback N(-) means N is in the word, but not at position 4. Similarly, E(-) means E is in the word, but not at position 5.

So for our next guess, we can try to put N in one of positions 1,2,3 or 5? Actually, position 5 was E's spot, but N could be at 5? Yes, because the feedback only says that in the first guess, the N was not at 4 and E not at 5. They could be elsewhere.

But when we guess again, we can place them in any position except the ones that were incorrect? No, we don't know where they are, so we must try different positions.

Common words: let's think of words that have N and E.

Examples: 
- ""INEPT"": I, N, E, P, T. But we don't know about I, P, T. Also, N is at position 2 and E at 4. Since E was at 5 in first guess and now at 4, that's fine. Similarly, N was at 4, now at 2.

But we need to avoid A, C, R. ""INEPT"" does not contain C, R, A, so that's fine.

Another word: ""ONSET"" – O, N, S, E, T. Positions: O(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5). Again, no A/C/R.

We could also consider ""ENDED"" but it has double E and double D? Not ideal for guessing because duplicates.

Another: ""LIONS"" but that's 5 letters? L,I,O,N,S – N is last, but we have E to include? ""LIONS"" has no E.

We must include both N and E.

Let's try ""STONE"": S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But wait, the feedback said N was not at position 4 and E not at position 5. In this guess, N is at 4 and E at 5? That would be bad because we know from previous feedback that they are not there.

So we cannot place N at position 4 or E at position 5? Exactly. We must avoid placing N at position 4 and E at position 5 because the feedback indicated those positions are incorrect.

Therefore, in ""STONE"", N would be at 4 and E at 5, which we know are wrong. So we shouldn't do that.

Instead, let me look for words that have N and E in other positions.

For example:
- Position N at 1: e.g., ""NEEDS"" – N(1), E(2), E(3), D(4), S(5). But E appears twice? Also, E at position 2, but E is in the word and we don't know where yet.

We don't know if E is at position 2 or not. Also, duplicates aren't great.

""INNER"" – but we can't use R, which is forbidden? R is not allowed since R(x) in feedback.

We must avoid C, R, A.

So letters to avoid: C, R, A.

Possible letters: B,D,E,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But more constrained by the word.

""MINES"": M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). N at 3 (not 4), E at 4 (not 5). This seems okay.

N was previously at position 4, which was wrong, so now we put it at position 3. E was at 5, now at 4. That avoids the forbidden positions.

Similarly, we might try ""OPENS"": O(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), S(5). But N at position 4? We had N(-) meaning position 4 was wrong for N, so if we put N at 4 again, it would likely be wrong. We want to avoid that position.

Therefore, we should not put N at position 4 or E at position 5.

In ""OPENS"", N is at 5? O-P-E-N-S. Positions: O(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), S(5). N is at 4? That's the same position as before. We should avoid that.

So ""MINES"": positions M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). Here N is at 3 (avoided 4), E is at 4 (avoided 5). Also, letters M, I, S are new and will give information.

Another word: ""SINCE"" – but it has C? No, C is forbidden. We cannot use C.

""PHONE"": P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But N at 4 and E at 5? Both are the positions we should avoid.

N at 4 is forbidden? The feedback said N is not at position 4, but could be elsewhere. But if we place N at position 4 again, it will definitely be marked wrong (since it's not the correct position). Similarly for E at 5.

We want to maximize new information, so better to place N and E in new positions.

Therefore, avoid position 4 for N and position 5 for E in this guess.

Let me think of words with N and E in other positions.

For N not at 4, meaning positions 1,2,3, or 5? But if we put N at 5, it's okay as long as E is not at 5? E could be elsewhere.

Similarly, E can be at positions 1,2,3,4.

So possible:

- Position N: 1,2,3,5

- Position E: 1,2,3,4

Now, we also need a valid word.

For example, ""NEWTS"": N(1), E(2), W(3), T(4), S(5). E at position 2, N at 1. Avoids N at 4 and E at 5? Yes. But E is at 2, not 5. S at position 5.

Similarly, ""TENOR"": but R is forbidden, so no.

After avoiding A,C,R, ""NEWTS"" seems acceptable? Let me confirm if NEWTS is a word: a newt is like a salamander, and NEWTS is the plural.

Alternatively, ""KNELT"": K(1), N(2), E(3), L(4), T(5). But E at 3 and N at 2 — avoids position 4 for N? Yes. But E is at 3, not 5. And N is at 2, not 4.

In KNELT, N is at position 2, E at position 3, neither is the forbidden position. But E was forbidden only at position 5, not 3. So it's okay.

Other letters: K, L, T — no C,R,A.

Similarly, ""MINES"" as I thought earlier: M,I,N at 3,E at 4,S at 5 — E at 4? Position 4 is fine for E? Because E was only forbidden at position 5, not position 4. Similarly, N at position 3 is okay.

For E: previously we had E at position 5, which was wrong, but now E can be at 4? Yes.

In fact, placing E at position 4 might be a good idea to test a new position.

Similarly, ""MINES"" or ""MINED""? ""MINED"" is past tense, valid.

But let's choose one that uses common letters to get more information.

Perhaps ""MINES"" is fine.

Another word: ""LINEN"" but it has N twice, which might not be ideal.

Better to have all distinct letters? No, not necessarily, but since we have limited guesses, duplicates can reduce information.

So MINES: M,I,N,E,S. All distinct except? No duplicates.

M,I,N,E,S are all distinct.

Similarly, NEWTS: N,E,W,T,S distinct.

KNELT: K,N,E,L,T distinct.

Which one has more common letters? S,T are common, so perhaps MINES or NEWS? NEWS is 4 letters? No, NEWS is 4.

""OWNS"" not 5.

I think MINES is reasonable.

We could think of ""SPINE"": S,P,I,N,E. Positions: S(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But placing N at 4? We know position 4 is wrong for N, so we shouldn't put N there. Similarly E at 5? Avoid.

So don't choose words with N at 4 or E at 5.

So, let's list:

- MINES: M=1, I=2, N=3, E=4, S=5

- KNELT: K=1, N=2, E=3, L=4, T=5

- BENCH: but C is forbidden? C not allowed.

- DINED: D(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) — D twice, and no forbidden letters. But D duplicate.

Not ideal.

Or ""WIDEN"": W(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), N(5). N is at position 5, E at 4. Avoid position 4 for N? We didn't put N at 4, we put it at 5. E at 4 is fine? Yes.

So ""WIDEN"" might be another option.

But we know N is in the word, so having N at position 5 is okay.

Similarly, E at position 4.

And no forbidden letters.

To choose among MINES, KNELT, WIDEN, NEWTS.

Common letters: vowels in the word? We know A is not in, so vowels are E (we know) and possibly others like I,O,U.

In MINES, we have I and E.

In KNELT, E only? But E is already known.

Perhaps MINES is good because it includes I and M,S.

Since the secret word has N and E, and let's say ""MINES"" has M,I,S – which are common.

Similarly, ""QUEST"" but Q not common? And does it have N? No, QUEST is Q,U,E,S,T — no N.

Another: ""UNSET"" — U,N,S,E,T. Positions U=1, N=2, S=3, E=4, T=5. Avoids forbidden positions.

But U is uncommon? Perhaps MINES is better.

I think I'll go with MINES. It's a word: plural of mine or excavations.

So, guess: MINES
</think>
- **Analysis of Previous Feedback**:  
  The first guess ""CRANE"" had the feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-). This means:
  - C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word at all.
  - N **is** in the secret word, but not in the 4th position.
  - E **is** in the secret word, but not in the 5th position.

- **Implications for the Next Guess**:  
  - Must include N and E (as they are present in the secret word), but avoid placing N at position 4 or E at position 5 since those positions were incorrect in ""CRANE"".
  - Must avoid using C, R, or A.
  - Should prioritize common letters and avoid duplicates to maximize information gain.
  - Possible new positions for N: positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Positions for E: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

- **Word Selection**:  
  Considering valid English words containing N and E:
  - Examples: ""MINES"", ""KNELT"", ""WIDEN"", or ""UNSET"".
  - ""MINES"" was chosen because:
    - Positions: M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), S(5) → avoids N at position 4 and E at position 5.
    - Uses all distinct letters (no duplicates), increasing information potential.
    - Introduces new common consonants (M, I, S) and a vowel (I).
    - Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A).

This guess will help clarify the positions of N and E and test new letters.

<guess>MINES</guess>",MINES,"We are on the second guess. The previous guess was CRANE with feedback: C(x) means C is not in the secret word at all. R(x) means R is not in the secret word. A(x) means A is not in the secret word. N(-) means N is in the word but in the wrong position. E(-) means E is in the word but also in the wrong position.

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word does NOT contain C, R, A.
- It does contain N and E, but not in the positions they were in CRANE. Since CRANE had N at the 4th position and E at the 5th, those positions are incorrect for N and E.

Now, for our next guess, we need to:
- Avoid using C, R, A.
- Include N and E, but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively.
- Since the word has 5 letters, we need to guess a word that meets these constraints.

Also, we want to try to get more information about the secret word. We know the word contains N and E, and there are 3 other letters we don't know yet.

Let's think about common 5-letter words that have N and E, but without C, R, A.

We can try to position N and E in different places. Since in the first guess N was at position 4 and E at position 5, we should put them in other positions.

Possible positions for N: it can be at 1,2,3 but not 4 (since - means not in that position, but present elsewhere). Similarly, E cannot be at position 5.

Let me note: the feedback N(-) means N is in the word, but not at position 4. Similarly, E(-) means E is in the word, but not at position 5.

So for our next guess, we can try to put N in one of positions 1,2,3 or 5? Actually, position 5 was E's spot, but N could be at 5? Yes, because the feedback only says that in the first guess, the N was not at 4 and E not at 5. They could be elsewhere.

But when we guess again, we can place them in any position except the ones that were incorrect? No, we don't know where they are, so we must try different positions.

Common words: let's think of words that have N and E.

Examples: 
- ""INEPT"": I, N, E, P, T. But we don't know about I, P, T. Also, N is at position 2 and E at 4. Since E was at 5 in first guess and now at 4, that's fine. Similarly, N was at 4, now at 2.

But we need to avoid A, C, R. ""INEPT"" does not contain C, R, A, so that's fine.

Another word: ""ONSET"" – O, N, S, E, T. Positions: O(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5). Again, no A/C/R.

We could also consider ""ENDED"" but it has double E and double D? Not ideal for guessing because duplicates.

Another: ""LIONS"" but that's 5 letters? L,I,O,N,S – N is last, but we have E to include? ""LIONS"" has no E.

We must include both N and E.

Let's try ""STONE"": S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But wait, the feedback said N was not at position 4 and E not at position 5. In this guess, N is at 4 and E at 5? That would be bad because we know from previous feedback that they are not there.

So we cannot place N at position 4 or E at position 5? Exactly. We must avoid placing N at position 4 and E at position 5 because the feedback indicated those positions are incorrect.

Therefore, in ""STONE"", N would be at 4 and E at 5, which we know are wrong. So we shouldn't do that.

Instead, let me look for words that have N and E in other positions.

For example:
- Position N at 1: e.g., ""NEEDS"" – N(1), E(2), E(3), D(4), S(5). But E appears twice? Also, E at position 2, but E is in the word and we don't know where yet.

We don't know if E is at position 2 or not. Also, duplicates aren't great.

""INNER"" – but we can't use R, which is forbidden? R is not allowed since R(x) in feedback.

We must avoid C, R, A.

So letters to avoid: C, R, A.

Possible letters: B,D,E,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But more constrained by the word.

""MINES"": M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). N at 3 (not 4), E at 4 (not 5). This seems okay.

N was previously at position 4, which was wrong, so now we put it at position 3. E was at 5, now at 4. That avoids the forbidden positions.

Similarly, we might try ""OPENS"": O(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), S(5). But N at position 4? We had N(-) meaning position 4 was wrong for N, so if we put N at 4 again, it would likely be wrong. We want to avoid that position.

Therefore, we should not put N at position 4 or E at position 5.

In ""OPENS"", N is at 5? O-P-E-N-S. Positions: O(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), S(5). N is at 4? That's the same position as before. We should avoid that.

So ""MINES"": positions M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). Here N is at 3 (avoided 4), E is at 4 (avoided 5). Also, letters M, I, S are new and will give information.

Another word: ""SINCE"" – but it has C? No, C is forbidden. We cannot use C.

""PHONE"": P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But N at 4 and E at 5? Both are the positions we should avoid.

N at 4 is forbidden? The feedback said N is not at position 4, but could be elsewhere. But if we place N at position 4 again, it will definitely be marked wrong (since it's not the correct position). Similarly for E at 5.

We want to maximize new information, so better to place N and E in new positions.

Therefore, avoid position 4 for N and position 5 for E in this guess.

Let me think of words with N and E in other positions.

For N not at 4, meaning positions 1,2,3, or 5? But if we put N at 5, it's okay as long as E is not at 5? E could be elsewhere.

Similarly, E can be at positions 1,2,3,4.

So possible:

- Position N: 1,2,3,5

- Position E: 1,2,3,4

Now, we also need a valid word.

For example, ""NEWTS"": N(1), E(2), W(3), T(4), S(5). E at position 2, N at 1. Avoids N at 4 and E at 5? Yes. But E is at 2, not 5. S at position 5.

Similarly, ""TENOR"": but R is forbidden, so no.

After avoiding A,C,R, ""NEWTS"" seems acceptable? Let me confirm if NEWTS is a word: a newt is like a salamander, and NEWTS is the plural.

Alternatively, ""KNELT"": K(1), N(2), E(3), L(4), T(5). But E at 3 and N at 2 — avoids position 4 for N? Yes. But E is at 3, not 5. And N is at 2, not 4.

In KNELT, N is at position 2, E at position 3, neither is the forbidden position. But E was forbidden only at position 5, not 3. So it's okay.

Other letters: K, L, T — no C,R,A.

Similarly, ""MINES"" as I thought earlier: M,I,N at 3,E at 4,S at 5 — E at 4? Position 4 is fine for E? Because E was only forbidden at position 5, not position 4. Similarly, N at position 3 is okay.

For E: previously we had E at position 5, which was wrong, but now E can be at 4? Yes.

In fact, placing E at position 4 might be a good idea to test a new position.

Similarly, ""MINES"" or ""MINED""? ""MINED"" is past tense, valid.

But let's choose one that uses common letters to get more information.

Perhaps ""MINES"" is fine.

Another word: ""LINEN"" but it has N twice, which might not be ideal.

Better to have all distinct letters? No, not necessarily, but since we have limited guesses, duplicates can reduce information.

So MINES: M,I,N,E,S. All distinct except? No duplicates.

M,I,N,E,S are all distinct.

Similarly, NEWTS: N,E,W,T,S distinct.

KNELT: K,N,E,L,T distinct.

Which one has more common letters? S,T are common, so perhaps MINES or NEWS? NEWS is 4 letters? No, NEWS is 4.

""OWNS"" not 5.

I think MINES is reasonable.

We could think of ""SPINE"": S,P,I,N,E. Positions: S(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But placing N at 4? We know position 4 is wrong for N, so we shouldn't put N there. Similarly E at 5? Avoid.

So don't choose words with N at 4 or E at 5.

So, let's list:

- MINES: M=1, I=2, N=3, E=4, S=5

- KNELT: K=1, N=2, E=3, L=4, T=5

- BENCH: but C is forbidden? C not allowed.

- DINED: D(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) — D twice, and no forbidden letters. But D duplicate.

Not ideal.

Or ""WIDEN"": W(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), N(5). N is at position 5, E at 4. Avoid position 4 for N? We didn't put N at 4, we put it at 5. E at 4 is fine? Yes.

So ""WIDEN"" might be another option.

But we know N is in the word, so having N at position 5 is okay.

Similarly, E at position 4.

And no forbidden letters.

To choose among MINES, KNELT, WIDEN, NEWTS.

Common letters: vowels in the word? We know A is not in, so vowels are E (we know) and possibly others like I,O,U.

In MINES, we have I and E.

In KNELT, E only? But E is already known.

Perhaps MINES is good because it includes I and M,S.

Since the secret word has N and E, and let's say ""MINES"" has M,I,S – which are common.

Similarly, ""QUEST"" but Q not common? And does it have N? No, QUEST is Q,U,E,S,T — no N.

Another: ""UNSET"" — U,N,S,E,T. Positions U=1, N=2, S=3, E=4, T=5. Avoids forbidden positions.

But U is uncommon? Perhaps MINES is better.

I think I'll go with MINES. It's a word: plural of mine or excavations.

So, guess: MINES- **Analysis of Previous Feedback**:  
  The first guess ""CRANE"" had the feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-). This means:
  - C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word at all.
  - N **is** in the secret word, but not in the 4th position.
  - E **is** in the secret word, but not in the 5th position.

- **Implications for the Next Guess**:  
  - Must include N and E (as they are present in the secret word), but avoid placing N at position 4 or E at position 5 since those positions were incorrect in ""CRANE"".
  - Must avoid using C, R, or A.
  - Should prioritize common letters and avoid duplicates to maximize information gain.
  - Possible new positions for N: positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Positions for E: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

- **Word Selection**:  
  Considering valid English words containing N and E:
  - Examples: ""MINES"", ""KNELT"", ""WIDEN"", or ""UNSET"".
  - ""MINES"" was chosen because:
    - Positions: M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), S(5) → avoids N at position 4 and E at position 5.
    - Uses all distinct letters (no duplicates), increasing information potential.
    - Introduces new common consonants (M, I, S) and a vowel (I).
    - Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A).

This guess will help clarify the positions of N and E and test new letters.",Guess 2: MINES -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,knelt,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are at the first guess. We have no prior information about the secret word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common letters and cover multiple vowels and consonants to get maximum information.
 Some common starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""STARE"", etc. I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess. The previous guess was CRANE with feedback: C(x) means C is not in the secret word at all. R(x) means R is not in the secret word. A(x) means A is not in the secret word. N(-) means N is in the word but in the wrong position. E(-) means E is in the word but also in the wrong position.

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word does NOT contain C, R, A.
- It does contain N and E, but not in the positions they were in CRANE. Since CRANE had N at the 4th position and E at the 5th, those positions are incorrect for N and E.

Now, for our next guess, we need to:
- Avoid using C, R, A.
- Include N and E, but not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively.
- Since the word has 5 letters, we need to guess a word that meets these constraints.

Also, we want to try to get more information about the secret word. We know the word contains N and E, and there are 3 other letters we don't know yet.

Let's think about common 5-letter words that have N and E, but without C, R, A.

We can try to position N and E in different places. Since in the first guess N was at position 4 and E at position 5, we should put them in other positions.

Possible positions for N: it can be at 1,2,3 but not 4 (since - means not in that position, but present elsewhere). Similarly, E cannot be at position 5.

Let me note: the feedback N(-) means N is in the word, but not at position 4. Similarly, E(-) means E is in the word, but not at position 5.

So for our next guess, we can try to put N in one of positions 1,2,3 or 5? Actually, position 5 was E's spot, but N could be at 5? Yes, because the feedback only says that in the first guess, the N was not at 4 and E not at 5. They could be elsewhere.

But when we guess again, we can place them in any position except the ones that were incorrect? No, we don't know where they are, so we must try different positions.

Common words: let's think of words that have N and E.

Examples: 
- ""INEPT"": I, N, E, P, T. But we don't know about I, P, T. Also, N is at position 2 and E at 4. Since E was at 5 in first guess and now at 4, that's fine. Similarly, N was at 4, now at 2.

But we need to avoid A, C, R. ""INEPT"" does not contain C, R, A, so that's fine.

Another word: ""ONSET"" – O, N, S, E, T. Positions: O(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5). Again, no A/C/R.

We could also consider ""ENDED"" but it has double E and double D? Not ideal for guessing because duplicates.

Another: ""LIONS"" but that's 5 letters? L,I,O,N,S – N is last, but we have E to include? ""LIONS"" has no E.

We must include both N and E.

Let's try ""STONE"": S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But wait, the feedback said N was not at position 4 and E not at position 5. In this guess, N is at 4 and E at 5? That would be bad because we know from previous feedback that they are not there.

So we cannot place N at position 4 or E at position 5? Exactly. We must avoid placing N at position 4 and E at position 5 because the feedback indicated those positions are incorrect.

Therefore, in ""STONE"", N would be at 4 and E at 5, which we know are wrong. So we shouldn't do that.

Instead, let me look for words that have N and E in other positions.

For example:
- Position N at 1: e.g., ""NEEDS"" – N(1), E(2), E(3), D(4), S(5). But E appears twice? Also, E at position 2, but E is in the word and we don't know where yet.

We don't know if E is at position 2 or not. Also, duplicates aren't great.

""INNER"" – but we can't use R, which is forbidden? R is not allowed since R(x) in feedback.

We must avoid C, R, A.

So letters to avoid: C, R, A.

Possible letters: B,D,E,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But more constrained by the word.

""MINES"": M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). N at 3 (not 4), E at 4 (not 5). This seems okay.

N was previously at position 4, which was wrong, so now we put it at position 3. E was at 5, now at 4. That avoids the forbidden positions.

Similarly, we might try ""OPENS"": O(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), S(5). But N at position 4? We had N(-) meaning position 4 was wrong for N, so if we put N at 4 again, it would likely be wrong. We want to avoid that position.

Therefore, we should not put N at position 4 or E at position 5.

In ""OPENS"", N is at 5? O-P-E-N-S. Positions: O(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), S(5). N is at 4? That's the same position as before. We should avoid that.

So ""MINES"": positions M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). Here N is at 3 (avoided 4), E is at 4 (avoided 5). Also, letters M, I, S are new and will give information.

Another word: ""SINCE"" – but it has C? No, C is forbidden. We cannot use C.

""PHONE"": P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But N at 4 and E at 5? Both are the positions we should avoid.

N at 4 is forbidden? The feedback said N is not at position 4, but could be elsewhere. But if we place N at position 4 again, it will definitely be marked wrong (since it's not the correct position). Similarly for E at 5.

We want to maximize new information, so better to place N and E in new positions.

Therefore, avoid position 4 for N and position 5 for E in this guess.

Let me think of words with N and E in other positions.

For N not at 4, meaning positions 1,2,3, or 5? But if we put N at 5, it's okay as long as E is not at 5? E could be elsewhere.

Similarly, E can be at positions 1,2,3,4.

So possible:

- Position N: 1,2,3,5

- Position E: 1,2,3,4

Now, we also need a valid word.

For example, ""NEWTS"": N(1), E(2), W(3), T(4), S(5). E at position 2, N at 1. Avoids N at 4 and E at 5? Yes. But E is at 2, not 5. S at position 5.

Similarly, ""TENOR"": but R is forbidden, so no.

After avoiding A,C,R, ""NEWTS"" seems acceptable? Let me confirm if NEWTS is a word: a newt is like a salamander, and NEWTS is the plural.

Alternatively, ""KNELT"": K(1), N(2), E(3), L(4), T(5). But E at 3 and N at 2 — avoids position 4 for N? Yes. But E is at 3, not 5. And N is at 2, not 4.

In KNELT, N is at position 2, E at position 3, neither is the forbidden position. But E was forbidden only at position 5, not 3. So it's okay.

Other letters: K, L, T — no C,R,A.

Similarly, ""MINES"" as I thought earlier: M,I,N at 3,E at 4,S at 5 — E at 4? Position 4 is fine for E? Because E was only forbidden at position 5, not position 4. Similarly, N at position 3 is okay.

For E: previously we had E at position 5, which was wrong, but now E can be at 4? Yes.

In fact, placing E at position 4 might be a good idea to test a new position.

Similarly, ""MINES"" or ""MINED""? ""MINED"" is past tense, valid.

But let's choose one that uses common letters to get more information.

Perhaps ""MINES"" is fine.

Another word: ""LINEN"" but it has N twice, which might not be ideal.

Better to have all distinct letters? No, not necessarily, but since we have limited guesses, duplicates can reduce information.

So MINES: M,I,N,E,S. All distinct except? No duplicates.

M,I,N,E,S are all distinct.

Similarly, NEWTS: N,E,W,T,S distinct.

KNELT: K,N,E,L,T distinct.

Which one has more common letters? S,T are common, so perhaps MINES or NEWS? NEWS is 4 letters? No, NEWS is 4.

""OWNS"" not 5.

I think MINES is reasonable.

We could think of ""SPINE"": S,P,I,N,E. Positions: S(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But placing N at 4? We know position 4 is wrong for N, so we shouldn't put N there. Similarly E at 5? Avoid.

So don't choose words with N at 4 or E at 5.

So, let's list:

- MINES: M=1, I=2, N=3, E=4, S=5

- KNELT: K=1, N=2, E=3, L=4, T=5

- BENCH: but C is forbidden? C not allowed.

- DINED: D(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) — D twice, and no forbidden letters. But D duplicate.

Not ideal.

Or ""WIDEN"": W(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), N(5). N is at position 5, E at 4. Avoid position 4 for N? We didn't put N at 4, we put it at 5. E at 4 is fine? Yes.

So ""WIDEN"" might be another option.

But we know N is in the word, so having N at position 5 is okay.

Similarly, E at position 4.

And no forbidden letters.

To choose among MINES, KNELT, WIDEN, NEWTS.

Common letters: vowels in the word? We know A is not in, so vowels are E (we know) and possibly others like I,O,U.

In MINES, we have I and E.

In KNELT, E only? But E is already known.

Perhaps MINES is good because it includes I and M,S.

Since the secret word has N and E, and let's say ""MINES"" has M,I,S – which are common.

Similarly, ""QUEST"" but Q not common? And does it have N? No, QUEST is Q,U,E,S,T — no N.

Another: ""UNSET"" — U,N,S,E,T. Positions U=1, N=2, S=3, E=4, T=5. Avoids forbidden positions.

But U is uncommon? Perhaps MINES is better.

I think I'll go with MINES. It's a word: plural of mine or excavations.

So, guess: MINES- **Analysis of Previous Feedback**:  
  The first guess ""CRANE"" had the feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-). This means:

  - Possible new positions for N: positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Positions for E: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

    - Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A).

We are on the third guess. We have feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: MINES -> M(x), I(x), N(-), E(-), S(x)
Meaning:
- M, I, S are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in position 3 (since in MINES, N was at position 3 and got (-), meaning it's present but not there).
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (since in MINES, E was at position 4 and got (-)).

Now, combining the information:

Letters known to be in the word: N and E (from both guesses).

Letters known to be absent: C, R, A, M, I, S.

We also know about the positions:
- N cannot be at position 3 or 4 (from MINES and CRANE respectively).
- E cannot be at position 4 or 5 (from MINES and CRANE respectively).

Since the word has 5 letters, and we know two of them (N and E), we need to find the other three letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent ones.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also need to place N and E in positions that are not forbidden.

Possible positions for N: 
- Positions 1, 2, 5 (since not 3 or 4).

Possible positions for E:
- Positions 1, 2, 3 (since not 4 or 5).

But note: E cannot be at position 5? Actually, from CRANE, E was at 5 and was wrong, so E is not at 5. From MINES, E was at 4 and wrong, so E not at 4. So E can be at 1,2,3.

Similarly, N: from CRANE, not at 4; from MINES, not at 3. So N can be at 1,2,5.

Now, we need to form a word that includes N and E, and three other letters from the remaining set.

Moreover, we want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have N and E, with N in {1,2,5} and E in {1,2,3}.

Also, avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,M,I,S.

Possible words:

Option 1: N at position 1, E at position 2? Example: ""NEVER"" but has E twice and R? R is absent. Not allowed.

Option 2: N at position 1, E at position 3: e.g., ""NUDGE"" but G and D? Let's see: N(1), U(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). But E is at position 5? But E cannot be at position 5! Because from CRANE, E(-) at position 5 means it's not there. So E at 5 is invalid.

We must avoid placing E at position 5.

Similarly, in ""NUDGE"", E is at 5, which is forbidden. So not allowed.

Option: N at position 1, E at position 3: but then the word must have E at 3. Example: ""NOTED"" — N(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), D(5). But E is at position 4? But from MINES, E(-) at position 4 means E is not at 4. So E cannot be at 4. Therefore, ""NOTED"" has E at 4, which is invalid.

We need E at 1,2, or 3.

So for N at 1 and E at 3: what words? For example, ""NEEDY"" — N(1), E(2), E(3), D(4), Y(5). But E at 2 and 3? Duplicate E, and E at 2 is allowed? But we have E at position 2 and 3. However, we don't know if there are multiple E's? The feedback doesn't indicate that. But in MINES, we had only one E and it was at 4, which was wrong. But the secret word might have two E's? We don't know.

But to avoid complexity, let's assume we prefer no duplicates for now.

Another word: ""NAKED"" — but A is absent? A is in the absent list, so no.

A is absent.

""NOBLE"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). But E at 5? Forbidden.

""NOBLY"" no E.

Perhaps N at position 2 and E at position 1? That is, E at 1, N at 2.

Example: ""ENTRY"" — E(1), N(2), T(3), R(4), Y(5). But R is absent, so no.

""ENVOY"" — E(1), N(2), V(3), O(4), Y(5). R not present? V and O are okay. But E at 1, N at 2. Also, no forbidden letters? C,R,A,M,I,S absent, so V,O,Y are new.

But E at position 1: is that allowed? Yes, E can be at 1.

Similarly, N at position 2: allowed? Yes, since not 3 or 4.

So ""ENVOY"" is a word: a diplomatic agent.

But let's check the positions: E at 1, N at 2, V at 3, O at 4, Y at 5.

Now, we know E cannot be at 5, but here it's at 1, fine. N cannot be at 3 or 4, here at 2, fine.

Another option: N at position 2, E at position 3.

Example: ""ONELY"" not a word. ""INERT"" but I is absent.

""ANODE"" but A absent.

""KNELT"" we considered before, but in KNELT: K(1), N(2), E(3), L(4), T(5). Now, N at 2 (allowed), E at 3 (allowed). Also, no forbidden letters? K, L, T are not in absent list.

Absent: C,R,A,M,I,S — so K,L,T are okay.

But in MINES, we had N at 3 and it was wrong, but here N is at 2, which is different.

Similarly, E at 3, which is new.

So ""KNELT"" is a valid option.

Another: ""WOVEN"" — W(1), O(2), V(3), E(4), N(5). But E at 4? Forbidden because MINES had E at 4 wrong. So E cannot be at 4. Also, N at 5? N at 5 is allowed? Yes, since N can be at 5.

But E at 4 is not allowed, so invalid.

Similarly, ""OFTEN"": O(1), F(2), T(3), E(4), N(5). E at 4? Forbidden.

So not.

Now, N at position 5 and E at position 1,2, or 3.

For example, E at 1, N at 5: ""EATEN"" but A and T? A absent. ""ELBOW"" no N. ""EXIST"" I and S absent.

""EDGED"" duplicate D, and E at 1, N not present? We need N.

""OPENS"" but S absent and E at 3? O(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), S(5). But N at 4? Forbidden (from CRANE). Also S absent.

Not.

E at 2, N at 5: e.g., ""BEADY"" A absent. ""BENDY"" — B(1), E(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5). But N at 3? Forbidden (from MINES, N not at 3). So invalid.

E at 3, N at 5: e.g., ""HOTEN"" not a word. ""BOXEN"" not word. ""TOKEN"" — T(1), O(2), K(3), E(4), N(5). But E at 4? Forbidden.

""TEPID"" no N.

So it's tricky.

Perhaps ""KNELT"" is a good choice: K(1), N(2), E(3), L(4), T(5)

Positions: N at 2 (allowed), E at 3 (allowed). L at 4 and T at 5 are new.

We can also consider ""ENVOY"": E(1), N(2), V(3), O(4), Y(5)

Both seem valid.

But in ""ENVOY"", we have E at 1 and N at 2, which are both possible.

We need to choose one that might give more information.

Since we have many letters to test, both introduce new letters.

But note: in the secret word, we know N and E are present, but we don't know about duplicates. However, since we haven't seen any indication of duplicates, we assume single for now.

Another word: ""BELOW"" but no N.

I think ""KNELT"" or ""ENVOY"" are candidates.

But let's see if we can find a word with E at position 1 and N at position 5? That might be good to test.

For example, ""EATEN"" invalid because of A.

""ELBOW"" no N.

""ENDOW"" — E(1), N(2), D(3), O(4), W(5). N at 2, E at 1. But we have N at 2, which is fine, but not at 5.

""OWNED"" — O(1), W(2), N(3), E(4), D(5). But N at 3? Forbidden (MINES said not at 3). E at 4? Forbidden.

Not.

""UNWED"" — U(1), N(2), W(3), E(4), D(5). E at 4 forbidden.

So perhaps N at 5 is hard to achieve with E at 1,2,3 without conflicting.

Therefore, let's go with either KNELT or ENVOY.

I'll choose KNELT because it has more common letters? K, L, T are common.

ENVOY has V and Y, which are less common.

So guess: KNELT

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If we guess KNELT:

- K at 1: if not in word, x; if in word but wrong position, -; if correct, ✓

Similarly for others.

But we don't know.

We might get information about K, L, T.

Similarly for ENVOY.

But KNELT seems fine.

Another word: ""JOINT"" but J and I? I is absent.

""POINT"" I absent.

""FLINT"" I absent? I is in absent list.

I is absent, so no.

""BLEND"" — B(1), L(2), E(3), N(4), D(5). But N at 4? Forbidden. Also, E at 3 is allowed, but N at 4 not.

Not.

So I think KNELT is a good choice.

Therefore, we guess KNELT.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)**  
  - **C, R, A** are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - **N** is **present** but not in position 4.  
  - **E** is **present** but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: MINES → Feedback: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(-) S(x)**  
  - **M, I, S** are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - **N** is **present** but not in position 3 (since it was marked ""-"" at position 3).  
  - **E** is **present** but not in position 4 (since it was marked ""-"" at position 4).  

### Key Inferences
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: N and E (both must appear, as indicated by ""-"" feedback).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, M, I, S (cannot appear in any position).  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - N cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from MINES and CRANE feedback).  
  - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from MINES and CRANE feedback).  
  - Therefore, possible positions for N: 1, 2, or 5.  
  - Possible positions for E: 1, 2, or 3.  
- **Remaining letters to test**: The secret word contains N and E, plus three unknown letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding absent letters: C, R, A, M, I, S). Focus on common consonants (e.g., B, D, G, L, T) and vowels (O, U) for maximum information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3
- **Goal**: Test new letters while respecting position constraints for N and E.  
- **Word choice**: After evaluating options (e.g., ""ENVOY"", ""WIDEN"", ""KNELT""), ""KNELT"" is selected because:  
  - Positions: K(1), N(2), E(3), L(4), T(5).  
    - N is in position 2 (allowed, since N cannot be in 3 or 4).  
    - E is in position 3 (allowed, since E cannot be in 4 or 5).  
  - Introduces three new common letters (K, L, T) not previously tested.  
  - Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, M, I, S).  
  - Provides high information potential: Tests N and E in new positions and covers frequent consonants.  

<guess>KNELT</guess>",KNELT,"We are on the third guess. We have feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: MINES -> M(x), I(x), N(-), E(-), S(x)
Meaning:
- M, I, S are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in position 3 (since in MINES, N was at position 3 and got (-), meaning it's present but not there).
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (since in MINES, E was at position 4 and got (-)).

Now, combining the information:

Letters known to be in the word: N and E (from both guesses).

Letters known to be absent: C, R, A, M, I, S.

We also know about the positions:
- N cannot be at position 3 or 4 (from MINES and CRANE respectively).
- E cannot be at position 4 or 5 (from MINES and CRANE respectively).

Since the word has 5 letters, and we know two of them (N and E), we need to find the other three letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent ones.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also need to place N and E in positions that are not forbidden.

Possible positions for N: 
- Positions 1, 2, 5 (since not 3 or 4).

Possible positions for E:
- Positions 1, 2, 3 (since not 4 or 5).

But note: E cannot be at position 5? Actually, from CRANE, E was at 5 and was wrong, so E is not at 5. From MINES, E was at 4 and wrong, so E not at 4. So E can be at 1,2,3.

Similarly, N: from CRANE, not at 4; from MINES, not at 3. So N can be at 1,2,5.

Now, we need to form a word that includes N and E, and three other letters from the remaining set.

Moreover, we want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have N and E, with N in {1,2,5} and E in {1,2,3}.

Also, avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,M,I,S.

Possible words:

Option 1: N at position 1, E at position 2? Example: ""NEVER"" but has E twice and R? R is absent. Not allowed.

Option 2: N at position 1, E at position 3: e.g., ""NUDGE"" but G and D? Let's see: N(1), U(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). But E is at position 5? But E cannot be at position 5! Because from CRANE, E(-) at position 5 means it's not there. So E at 5 is invalid.

We must avoid placing E at position 5.

Similarly, in ""NUDGE"", E is at 5, which is forbidden. So not allowed.

Option: N at position 1, E at position 3: but then the word must have E at 3. Example: ""NOTED"" — N(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), D(5). But E is at position 4? But from MINES, E(-) at position 4 means E is not at 4. So E cannot be at 4. Therefore, ""NOTED"" has E at 4, which is invalid.

We need E at 1,2, or 3.

So for N at 1 and E at 3: what words? For example, ""NEEDY"" — N(1), E(2), E(3), D(4), Y(5). But E at 2 and 3? Duplicate E, and E at 2 is allowed? But we have E at position 2 and 3. However, we don't know if there are multiple E's? The feedback doesn't indicate that. But in MINES, we had only one E and it was at 4, which was wrong. But the secret word might have two E's? We don't know.

But to avoid complexity, let's assume we prefer no duplicates for now.

Another word: ""NAKED"" — but A is absent? A is in the absent list, so no.

A is absent.

""NOBLE"": N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). But E at 5? Forbidden.

""NOBLY"" no E.

Perhaps N at position 2 and E at position 1? That is, E at 1, N at 2.

Example: ""ENTRY"" — E(1), N(2), T(3), R(4), Y(5). But R is absent, so no.

""ENVOY"" — E(1), N(2), V(3), O(4), Y(5). R not present? V and O are okay. But E at 1, N at 2. Also, no forbidden letters? C,R,A,M,I,S absent, so V,O,Y are new.

But E at position 1: is that allowed? Yes, E can be at 1.

Similarly, N at position 2: allowed? Yes, since not 3 or 4.

So ""ENVOY"" is a word: a diplomatic agent.

But let's check the positions: E at 1, N at 2, V at 3, O at 4, Y at 5.

Now, we know E cannot be at 5, but here it's at 1, fine. N cannot be at 3 or 4, here at 2, fine.

Another option: N at position 2, E at position 3.

Example: ""ONELY"" not a word. ""INERT"" but I is absent.

""ANODE"" but A absent.

""KNELT"" we considered before, but in KNELT: K(1), N(2), E(3), L(4), T(5). Now, N at 2 (allowed), E at 3 (allowed). Also, no forbidden letters? K, L, T are not in absent list.

Absent: C,R,A,M,I,S — so K,L,T are okay.

But in MINES, we had N at 3 and it was wrong, but here N is at 2, which is different.

Similarly, E at 3, which is new.

So ""KNELT"" is a valid option.

Another: ""WOVEN"" — W(1), O(2), V(3), E(4), N(5). But E at 4? Forbidden because MINES had E at 4 wrong. So E cannot be at 4. Also, N at 5? N at 5 is allowed? Yes, since N can be at 5.

But E at 4 is not allowed, so invalid.

Similarly, ""OFTEN"": O(1), F(2), T(3), E(4), N(5). E at 4? Forbidden.

So not.

Now, N at position 5 and E at position 1,2, or 3.

For example, E at 1, N at 5: ""EATEN"" but A and T? A absent. ""ELBOW"" no N. ""EXIST"" I and S absent.

""EDGED"" duplicate D, and E at 1, N not present? We need N.

""OPENS"" but S absent and E at 3? O(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), S(5). But N at 4? Forbidden (from CRANE). Also S absent.

Not.

E at 2, N at 5: e.g., ""BEADY"" A absent. ""BENDY"" — B(1), E(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5). But N at 3? Forbidden (from MINES, N not at 3). So invalid.

E at 3, N at 5: e.g., ""HOTEN"" not a word. ""BOXEN"" not word. ""TOKEN"" — T(1), O(2), K(3), E(4), N(5). But E at 4? Forbidden.

""TEPID"" no N.

So it's tricky.

Perhaps ""KNELT"" is a good choice: K(1), N(2), E(3), L(4), T(5)

Positions: N at 2 (allowed), E at 3 (allowed). L at 4 and T at 5 are new.

We can also consider ""ENVOY"": E(1), N(2), V(3), O(4), Y(5)

Both seem valid.

But in ""ENVOY"", we have E at 1 and N at 2, which are both possible.

We need to choose one that might give more information.

Since we have many letters to test, both introduce new letters.

But note: in the secret word, we know N and E are present, but we don't know about duplicates. However, since we haven't seen any indication of duplicates, we assume single for now.

Another word: ""BELOW"" but no N.

I think ""KNELT"" or ""ENVOY"" are candidates.

But let's see if we can find a word with E at position 1 and N at position 5? That might be good to test.

For example, ""EATEN"" invalid because of A.

""ELBOW"" no N.

""ENDOW"" — E(1), N(2), D(3), O(4), W(5). N at 2, E at 1. But we have N at 2, which is fine, but not at 5.

""OWNED"" — O(1), W(2), N(3), E(4), D(5). But N at 3? Forbidden (MINES said not at 3). E at 4? Forbidden.

Not.

""UNWED"" — U(1), N(2), W(3), E(4), D(5). E at 4 forbidden.

So perhaps N at 5 is hard to achieve with E at 1,2,3 without conflicting.

Therefore, let's go with either KNELT or ENVOY.

I'll choose KNELT because it has more common letters? K, L, T are common.

ENVOY has V and Y, which are less common.

So guess: KNELT

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If we guess KNELT:

- K at 1: if not in word, x; if in word but wrong position, -; if correct, ✓

Similarly for others.

But we don't know.

We might get information about K, L, T.

Similarly for ENVOY.

But KNELT seems fine.

Another word: ""JOINT"" but J and I? I is absent.

""POINT"" I absent.

""FLINT"" I absent? I is in absent list.

I is absent, so no.

""BLEND"" — B(1), L(2), E(3), N(4), D(5). But N at 4? Forbidden. Also, E at 3 is allowed, but N at 4 not.

Not.

So I think KNELT is a good choice.

Therefore, we guess KNELT.### Analysis of Previous Feedback
